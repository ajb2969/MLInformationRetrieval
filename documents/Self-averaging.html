<h1>Self-averaging</h1>
<hr/>
<p>A <strong>self-averaging</strong> physical property of a disordered system is one that can be described by averaging over a sufficiently large sample. The concept was introduced by <a href="Ilya_Mikhailovich_Lifshitz" title="wikilink">Ilya Mikhailovich Lifshitz</a>.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>Frequently in <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a> one comes across situations where <a href="Quenched_disorder" title="wikilink">quenched randomness</a> plays an important role. Any <a href="physical_property" title="wikilink">physical property</a> <em>X</em> of such a system, would require an averaging over all disorder realisations. The system can be completely described by the average [<em>X</em>] where [...] denotes averaging over realisations (“averaging over samples”) provided the <a href="relative_variance" title="wikilink">relative variance</a> <em>R</em><sub><em>X</em></sub> = <em>V</em><sub><em>X</em></sub> / [<em>X</em>]<sup>2</sup> → 0 as <em>N</em>→∞, where <em>V</em><sub><em>X</em></sub> = [<em>X</em><sup>2</sup>] − [<em>X</em>]<sup>2</sup> and <em>N</em> denotes the size of the realisation. In such a scenario a single large system is sufficient to represent the whole ensemble. Such quantities are called self-averaging. Away from criticality, when the larger lattice is built from smaller blocks, then due to the additivity property of an <a href="extensive_quantity" title="wikilink">extensive quantity</a>, the <a href="central_limit_theorem" title="wikilink">central limit theorem</a> guarantees that <em>R</em><sub><em>X</em></sub> ~ <em>N</em><sup>−1</sup> thereby ensuring self-averaging. On the other hand, at the critical point, the question whether <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> is self-averaging or not becomes nontrivial, due to long range <a href="correlation" title="wikilink">correlations</a>.</p>
<h2 id="non-self-averaging-systems">Non self-averaging systems</h2>
<p>At the pure critical point randomness is classified as relevant if, by the standard definition of relevance, it leads to a change in the critical behaviour (i.e., the critical exponents) of the pure system. It has been shown by recent renormalization group and <a href="numerical_methods" title="wikilink">numerical studies</a> that self-averaging property is lost if randomness or disorder is relevant.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Most importantly as N → ∞, R<sub>X</sub> at the critical point approaches a constant. Such systems are called non self-averaging. Thus unlike the self-averaging scenario, numerical simulations cannot lead to an improved picture in larger lattices (large N), even if the critical point is exactly known. In summary, various types of self-averaging can be indexed with the help of the <a class="uri" href="asymptotic" title="wikilink">asymptotic</a> size dependence of a quantity like R<sub>X</sub>. If R<sub>X</sub> falls off to zero with size, it is self-averaging whereas if R<sub>X</sub> approaches a constant as N → ∞, the system is non-self-averaging.</p>
<h2 id="strong-and-weak-self-averaging">Strong and weak self-averaging</h2>
<p>There is a further classification of self-averaging systems as strong and weak. If the exhibited behavior is <em>R</em><sub><em>X</em></sub> ~ <em>N</em><sup>−1</sup> as suggested by the central limit theorem, mentioned earlier, the system is said to be strongly self-averaging. Some systems shows a slower <a href="power_law" title="wikilink">power law</a> decay <em>R</em><sub><em>X</em></sub> ~ <em>N</em><sup>−<em>z</em></sup> with 0  The RG arguments mentioned above need to be extended to situations with sharp limit of <em>T</em><sub><em>c</em></sub> distribution and long range interactions.</p>
