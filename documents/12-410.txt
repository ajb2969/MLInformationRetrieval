   Affine Grassmannian (manifold)      Affine Grassmannian (manifold)   In mathematics , there are two distinct meanings of the term affine Grassmannian . In one it is the manifold of all k -dimensional affine subspaces of R n (described on this page), while in the other the affine Grassmannian is a quotient of a group-ring based on formal Laurent series.  Formal definition  Given a finite-dimensional vector space  V and a non-negative integer k , then Graff k ( V ) is the topological space of all affine  k -dimensional subspaces of V .  It has a natural projection p :Graff k ( V ) → Gr k ( V ), the Grassmannian of all linear k -dimensional subspaces of V by defining p ( U ) to be the translation of U to a subspace through the origin. This projection is a fibration, and if V is given an inner product, the fibre containing U can be identified with    p    (  U  )   ⟂       p   superscript  U  perpendicular-to     p(U)^{\perp}   , the orthogonal complement to p ( U ). The fibres are therefore vector spaces, and the projection p is a vector bundle over the Grassmannian , which defines the manifold structure on Graff k ( V ).  As a homogeneous space , the affine Grassmannian of an n -dimensional vector space V can be identified with        Graff  k    (  V  )    ≃    E   (  n  )       E   (  k  )    ×  O    (   n  -  k   )        similar-to-or-equals     subscript  Graff  k   V       E  n         E  k   O     n  k       \mathrm{Graff}_{k}(V)\simeq\frac{E(n)}{E(k)\times O(n-k)}     where E ( n ) is the Euclidean group of R n and O( m ) is the orthogonal group on R m . It follows that the dimension is given by        dim   [    Graff  k    (  V  )    ]    =    (   n  -  k   )    (   k  +  1   )     .       dimension   delimited-[]     subscript  Graff  k   V         n  k     k  1      \dim\left[\mathrm{Graff}_{k}(V)\right]=(n-k)(k+1)\,.   (This relation is easier to deduce from the identification of next section, as the difference between the number of coefficients, ( n − k )( n +1) and the dimension of the linear group acting on the equations, ( n − k ) 2 .)  Relationship with ordinary Grassmannian  Let be the usual linear coordinates on R n . Then R n is embedded into R n +1 as the affine hyperplane x n +1 = 1. The k -dimensional affine subspaces of R n are in one-to-one correspondence with the ( k + 1 )-dimensional linear subspaces of R n +1 that are in general position with respect to the plane x n +1 = 1. Indeed, a k -dimensional affine subspace of R n is the locus of solutions of a rank n − k system of affine equations        a  11    x  1    +  ⋯  +    a   1  n     x  n           subscript  a  11    subscript  x  1    normal-⋯     subscript  a    1  n     subscript  x  n      \displaystyle a_{11}x_{1}+\cdots+a_{1n}x_{n}   These determine a rank n − k system of linear equations on R n +1        a  11    x  1    +  ⋯  +    a   1  n     x  n           subscript  a  11    subscript  x  1    normal-⋯     subscript  a    1  n     subscript  x  n      \displaystyle a_{11}x_{1}+\cdots+a_{1n}x_{n}     whose solution is a ( k + 1)-plane that, when intersected with x n +1 = 1, is the original k -plane.  Because of this identification, Graff( k , n ) is a Zariski open set in Gr( k + 1, n + 1).
