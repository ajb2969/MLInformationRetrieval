   Stokes radius      Stokes radius   The Stokes radius or Stokes-Einstein radius of a solute is the radius of a hard sphere that diffuses at the same rate as that solute. Named after George Gabriel Stokes , it is closely related to solute mobility, factoring in not only size but also solvent effects. A smaller ion with stronger hydration, for example, may have a greater Stokes radius than a larger but weaker ion.  Stokes radius is sometimes used synonymously with effective hydrated radius in solution . 1  Hydrodynamic radius , R H , can refer to the Stokes radius of a polymer or other macromolecule.  Spherical case  According to Stokes’ law , a perfect sphere traveling through a viscous liquid feels a drag force proportional to the frictional coefficient   f   f   f   :       F   d  r  a  g    =   f  s   =    (   6  π  η  a   )   s          subscript  F    d  r  a  g      f  s            6  π  η  a   s      F_{drag}=fs=(6\pi\eta a)s     where   η   η   \eta   is the liquid's viscosity ,   s   s   s   is the sphere's drift speed, and   a   a   a   is its radius. Because ionic mobility    μ   μ   \mu   is directly proportional to drift speed, it is inversely proportional to the frictional coefficient:      μ  =    z  e   f       μ      z  e   f     \mu=\frac{ze}{f}     where    z  e      z  e    ze   represents ionic charge in integer multiples of electron charges.  In 1905, Albert Einstein found the diffusion coefficient   D   D   D   of an ion to be proportional to its mobility:      D  =    μ   k  B   T   q   =     k  b   T   f         D      μ   subscript  k  B   T   q             subscript  k  b   T   f      D=\frac{\mu k_{B}T}{q}=\frac{k_{b}T}{f}     where    k  B     subscript  k  B    k_{B}   is the Boltzmann constant and   q   q   q   is electrical charge . This is known as the Einstein relation . Substituting in the frictional coefficient of a perfect sphere from Stokes’ law yields      D  =     k  b   T    6  π  η  a        D       subscript  k  b   T     6  π  η  a      D=\frac{k_{b}T}{6\pi\eta a}     which can be rearranged to solve for   a   a   a   , the radius:       R  H   =  a  =     k  b   T    6  π  η  D           subscript  R  H   a            subscript  k  b   T     6  π  η  D       R_{H}=a=\frac{k_{b}T}{6\pi\eta D}     In non-spherical systems, the frictional coefficient is determined by the size and shape of the species under consideration.  Research applications  Stokes radii are often determined experimentally by gel-permeation or gel-filtration chromatography. 2 3 4 5 They are useful in characterizing biological species due to the size-dependence of processes like enzyme-substrate interaction and membrane diffusion. 6 The Stokes radii of sediment, soil, and aerosol particles are considered in ecological measurements and models. 7 They likewise play a role in the study of polymer and other macromolecular systems. 8  See also   Capillary electrophoresis  Dynamic light scattering  Equivalent spherical diameter   References  "  Category:Fluid dynamics     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩
