   Glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase      Glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase   Glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase (, GpgP protein ) is an enzyme with system name alpha-D-glucosyl-3-phospho-D-glycerate phosphohydrolase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-3-phospho-D-glycerate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glycerate + phosphate    The enzyme is involved in biosynthesis of 2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glycerate.
