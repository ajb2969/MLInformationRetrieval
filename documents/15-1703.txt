Glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase

Glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase (, GpgP protein) is an enzyme with system name alpha-D-glucosyl-3-phospho-D-glycerate phosphohydrolase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-3-phospho-D-glycerate + H2O 
 
 
 
  2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glycerate + phosphate


The enzyme is involved in biosynthesis of 2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glycerate.
