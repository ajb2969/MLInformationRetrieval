   Filtered algebra      Filtered algebra   In mathematics , a filtered algebra is a generalization of the notion of a graded algebra . Examples appear in many branches of mathematics , especially in homological algebra and representation theory .  A filtered algebra over the field    k   k   k   is an algebra     (  A  ,  ⋅  )     A  normal-⋅    (A,\cdot)   over   k   k   k   which has an increasing sequence     {  0  }   ⊂   F  0   ⊂   F  1   ⊂  ⋯  ⊂   F  i   ⊂  ⋯  ⊂  A         0    subscript  F  0         subscript  F  1        normal-⋯        subscript  F  i        normal-⋯       A     \{0\}\subset F_{0}\subset F_{1}\subset\cdots\subset F_{i}\subset\cdots\subset A   of subspaces of   A   A   A   such that      A  =    ∪   i  ∈  ℕ     F  i        A    subscript     i  ℕ     subscript  F  i      A=\cup_{i\in\mathbb{N}}F_{i}     and that is compatible with the multiplication in the following sense          ∀  m   ,  n   ∈  ℕ   ,     F  m   ⋅   F  n    ⊂   F   n  +  m      .     formulae-sequence      for-all  m   n   ℕ      normal-⋅   subscript  F  m    subscript  F  n     subscript  F    n  m       \forall m,n\in\mathbb{N},\qquad F_{m}\cdot F_{n}\subset F_{n+m}.     Associated graded algebra  In general there is the following construction that produces a graded algebra out of a filtered algebra.  If   A   A   A   is a filtered algebra then the associated graded algebra     𝒢   (  A  )       𝒢  A    \mathcal{G}(A)   is defined as follows: G_n\,,  where,        G  0   =   F  0    ,       subscript  G  0    subscript  F  0     G_{0}=F_{0},   and         ∀  n   >  0   ,    G  n   =    F  n   /    F   n  -  1        ,     formulae-sequence     for-all  n   0      subscript  G  n      subscript  F  n    subscript  F    n  1        \forall n>0,\quad G_{n}=F_{n}/F_{n-1}\,,     |2= the multiplication is defined by        (   x  +   F   n  -  1     )    (   y  +   F   m  -  1     )    =    x  ⋅  y   +   F    n  +  m   -  1             x   subscript  F    n  1       y   subscript  F    m  1         normal-⋅  x  y    subscript  F      n  m   1       (x+F_{n-1})(y+F_{m-1})=x\cdot y+F_{n+m-1}     for all    x  ∈   F  n       x   subscript  F  n     x\in F_{n}   and    y  ∈   F  m       y   subscript  F  m     y\in F_{m}   . (More precisely, the multiplication map       𝒢   (  A  )    ×  𝒢    (  A  )    →   𝒢   (  A  )       normal-→        𝒢  A   𝒢   A     𝒢  A     \mathcal{G}(A)\times\mathcal{G}(A)\to\mathcal{G}(A)   is combined from the maps         (    F  n   /   F   n  -  1     )   ×   (    F  m   /   F   m  -  1     )    →    F   n  +  m    /   F    n  +  m   -  1      ,    (   x  +   F   n  -  1     ,   y  +   F   m  -  1     )   ↦    x  ⋅  y   +   F    n  +  m   -  1         formulae-sequence   normal-→       subscript  F  n    subscript  F    n  1        subscript  F  m    subscript  F    m  1         subscript  F    n  m     subscript  F      n  m   1       maps-to     x   subscript  F    n  1       y   subscript  F    m  1         normal-⋅  x  y    subscript  F      n  m   1        (F_{n}/F_{n-1})\times(F_{m}/F_{m-1})\to F_{n+m}/F_{n+m-1},\ \ \ \ \ \left(x+F_%
 {n-1},y+F_{m-1}\right)\mapsto x\cdot y+F_{n+m-1}     for all    n  ≥  0      n  0    n\geq 0   and    m  ≥  0      m  0    m\geq 0   .) }} The multiplication is well defined and endows    𝒢   (  A  )       𝒢  A    \mathcal{G}(A)   with the structure of a graded algebra, with gradation      {   G  n   }    n  ∈  ℕ    .     subscript    subscript  G  n      n  ℕ     \{G_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}.   Furthermore if   A   A   A   is associative then so is    𝒢   (  A  )       𝒢  A    \mathcal{G}(A)   . Also if   A   A   A   is unital, such that the unit lies in    F  0     subscript  F  0    F_{0}   , then    𝒢   (  A  )       𝒢  A    \mathcal{G}(A)   will be unital as well.  As algebras   A   A   A   and    𝒢   (  A  )       𝒢  A    \mathcal{G}(A)   are distinct (with the exception of the trivial case that   A   A   A   is graded) but as vector spaces they are isomorphic .  Examples  Any graded algebra graded by ℕ, for example    A  =    ⊕   n  ∈  ℕ     A  n        A    subscript  direct-sum    n  ℕ     subscript  A  n      A=\oplus_{n\in\mathbb{N}}A_{n}   , has a filtration given by     F  n   =    ⊕   i  =  0   n    A  i         subscript  F  n     superscript   subscript  direct-sum    i  0    n    subscript  A  i      F_{n}=\oplus_{i=0}^{n}A_{i}   .  An example of a filtered algebra is the Clifford algebra     Cliff   (  V  ,  q  )       Cliff   V  q     \mathrm{Cliff}(V,q)   of a vector space   V   V   V   endowed with a quadratic form     q  .    q   q.   The associated graded algebra is    ⋀  V      V    \bigwedge V   , the exterior algebra of    V  .    V   V.     The symmetric algebra on the dual of an affine space is a filtered algebra of polynomials; on a vector space , one instead obtains a graded algebra.  The universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra    𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is also naturally filtered. The PBW theorem states that the associated graded algebra is simply    Sym   (  𝔤  )       Sym  𝔤    \mathrm{Sym}(\mathfrak{g})   .  Scalar differential operators on a manifold   M   M   M   form a filtered algebra where the filtration is given by the degree of differential operators. The associated graded algebra is the commutative algebra of smooth functions on the cotangent bundle     T  *   M       superscript  T    M    T^{*}M   which are polynomial along the fibers of the projection    π  :     T  *   M   →  M      normal-:  π   normal-→     superscript  T    M   M     \pi\colon T^{*}M\rightarrow M   .  The group algebra of a group with a length function is a filtered algebra.  See also   Filtration (mathematics)  Length function   References     "  Category:Algebras  Category:Homological algebra
