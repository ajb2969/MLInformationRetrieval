   Aubin–Lions lemma      Aubin–Lions lemma   In mathematics , the Aubin–Lions lemma (or theorem) is a result in the theory of Sobolev spaces of Banach space -valued functions, which provides a compactness criterion that is useful in the study of nonlinear evolutionary partial differential equations . Typically, to prove the existence of solutions one first constructs approximate solutions (for example, by a Galerkin method or by mollification of the equation), then uses the compactness lemma to show that there is a convergent subsequence of approximate solutions whose limit is a solution.  The result is named after the French  mathematicians  Thierry Aubin and Jacques-Louis Lions . In the original proof by Aubin, 1 the spaces X 0 and X 1 in the statement of the lemma were assumed to be reflexive , but this assumption was removed by Simon, 2 so the result is also referred to as the Aubin–Lions–Simon lemma . 3  Statement of the lemma  Let X 0 , X and X 1 be three Banach spaces with X 0 ⊆ X ⊆ X 1 . Suppose that X 0 is compactly embedded in X and that X is continuously embedded in X 1 . For 1 ≤ p , q ≤ +∞, let       W  =   {   u  ∈    L  p    (   [  0  ,  T  ]   ;   X  0   )     |    u  ˙   ∈    L  q    (   [  0  ,  T  ]   ;   X  1   )     }    .      W   conditional-set    u     superscript  L  p     0  T    subscript  X  0         normal-˙  u      superscript  L  q     0  T    subscript  X  1         W=\{u\in L^{p}([0,T];X_{0})|\dot{u}\in L^{q}([0,T];X_{1})\}.     (i) If p  p ([0, T ]; X ) is compact.  (ii) If p = +∞ and q >  1, then the embedding of W into C ([0, T ]; X ) is compact.
