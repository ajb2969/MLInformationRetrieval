   Koebe quarter theorem      Koebe quarter theorem   In complex analysis , a branch of mathematics , the Koebe 1/4 theorem states the following:   Koebe Quarter Theorem. The image of an injective analytic function f : D → C from the unit disk  D onto a subset of the complex plane contains the disk whose center is f (0) and whose radius is | f′ (0)|/4.   The theorem is named after Paul Koebe , who conjectured the result in 1907. The theorem was proven by Ludwig Bieberbach in 1916. The example of the Koebe function shows that the constant 1/4 in the theorem cannot be improved.  A related result is the Schwarz lemma , and a notion related to both is conformal radius .  Grönwall's area theorem  Suppose that       g   (  z  )    =   z  +    b  1    z   -  1     +    b  2    z   -  2     +  ⋯         g  z     z     subscript  b  1    superscript  z    1        subscript  b  2    superscript  z    2     normal-⋯     g(z)=z+b_{1}z^{-1}+b_{2}z^{-2}+\cdots     is univalent in | z | > 1. Then        ∑   n  ≥  1     n    |   b  n   |   2     ≤  1.        subscript     n  1      n   superscript     subscript  b  n    2     1.    \sum_{n\geq 1}n|b_{n}|^{2}\leq 1.     In fact, if r > 1, the complement of the image of the disk |z| > r is a bounded domain X ( r ). Its area is given by         ∫   X   (  r  )      d   x   d  y    =    1   2  i      ∫    ∂  X    (  r  )        z  ¯    d  z     =   -    1   2  i      ∫    |  z  |   =  r       g  ¯    d  g      =    1   2  π   r  2     -    1   2  π     ∑   n    |   b  n   |   2    r   2  n         .          subscript     X  r      d  x  d  y        1    2  i      subscript       X   r       normal-¯  z   d  z                1    2  i      subscript       z   r       normal-¯  g   d  g               1    2  π   superscript  r  2         1    2  π        n   superscript     subscript  b  n    2    superscript  r    2  n           \int_{X(r)}dx\,dy={1\over 2i}\int_{\partial X(r)}\overline{z}\,dz=-{1\over 2i}%
 \int_{|z|=r}\overline{g}\,dg={1\over 2\pi r^{2}}-{1\over 2\pi}\sum n|b_{n}|^{2%
 }r^{2n}.     Since the area is positive, the result follows by letting r decrease to 1. The above proof shows equality holds if and only if the complement of the image of g has zero area, i.e. Lebesgue measure zero.  This result was proved in 1914 by the Swedish mathematician Thomas Hakon Grönwall .  Koebe function  The Koebe function is defined by       f   (  z  )    =   z    (   1  -  z   )   2    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    n   z  n             f  z     z   superscript    1  z   2           superscript   subscript     n  1        n   superscript  z  n        f(z)=\frac{z}{(1-z)^{2}}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}nz^{n}     Application of the theorem to this function shows that the constant 1/4 in the theorem cannot be improved, as the image domain f ( D ) does not contain the point z = −1/4 and so cannot contain any disk centred at 0 with radius larger than 1/4.  The rotated Koebe function is        f  α    (  z  )    =   z    (   1  -   α  z    )   2    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    n   α   n  -  1     z  n              subscript  f  α   z     z   superscript    1    α  z    2           superscript   subscript     n  1        n   superscript  α    n  1     superscript  z  n        f_{\alpha}(z)=\frac{z}{(1-\alpha z)^{2}}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n\alpha^{n-1}z^{n}     with α a complex number of absolute value 1. The Koebe function and its rotations are schlicht : that is, univalent (analytic and one-to-one ) and satisfying f (0) = 0 and f′ (0) = 1.  Bieberbach's coefficient inequality for univalent functions  Let       g   (  z  )    =   z  +    a  2    z  2    +    a  3    z  3    +  ⋯         g  z     z     subscript  a  2    superscript  z  2       subscript  a  3    superscript  z  3    normal-⋯     g(z)=z+a_{2}z^{2}+a_{3}z^{3}+\cdots     be univalent in | z | |a_2|\le 2.  This follows by applying Gronwall's area theorem to the odd univalent function        g    (   z  2   )    -   1  /  2      =     z   -  1    -    1  2    a  2   z    +  ⋯    .        g   superscript   superscript  z  2       1  2           superscript  z    1        1  2    subscript  a  2   z    normal-⋯     g(z^{2})^{-1/2}=z^{-1}-{1\over 2}a_{2}z+\cdots.     Equality holds if and only if g is a rotated Koebe function.  This result was proved by Ludwig Bieberbach in 1916 and provided the basis for his celebrated conjecture that | a n | ≤ n , proved in 1985 by Louis de Branges .  Proof of quarter theorem  Applying an affine map, it can be assumed that         f   (  0  )    =  0   ,     f  ′    (  0  )    =  1    ,     formulae-sequence      f  0   0        superscript  f  normal-′   0   1     f(0)=0,\,\,\,f^{\prime}(0)=1,     so that        f   (  z  )    =   z  +    a  2    z  2    +  ⋯    .        f  z     z     subscript  a  2    superscript  z  2    normal-⋯     f(z)=z+a_{2}z^{2}+\cdots.     If w is not in f ( D ), then       h   (  z  )    =    w  f   (  z  )     w  -   f   (  z  )      =   z  +    (    a  2   +   w   -  1     )    z  2    +  ⋯           h  z       w  f  z     w    f  z            z       subscript  a  2    superscript  w    1      superscript  z  2    normal-⋯      h(z)={wf(z)\over w-f(z)}=z+(a_{2}+w^{-1})z^{2}+\cdots     is univalent in | z |  |w|^{-1} \le |a_2| + |a_2 + w^{-1}|\le 4,  so that        |  w  |   ≥   1  4    .        w     1  4     |w|\geq{1\over 4}.     Koebe distortion theorem  The Koebe distortion theorem gives a series of bounds for a univalent function and its derivative. It is a direct consequence of Bieberbach's inequality for the second coefficient and the Koebe quarter theorem. 1  Let f ( z ) be a univalent function on | z | {r \over (1+r)^2}\le |f(z)|\le {r\over (1-r)^2}        1  -  r     (   1  +  r   )   3    ≤   |    f  ′    (  z  )    |   ≤    1  +  r     (   1  -  r   )   3              1  r    superscript    1  r   3         superscript  f  normal-′   z             1  r    superscript    1  r   3       {1-r\over(1+r)^{3}}\leq|f^{\prime}(z)|\leq{1+r\over(1-r)^{3}}           1  -  r    1  +  r    ≤   |   z     f  ′    (  z  )     f   (  z  )      |   ≤    1  +  r    1  -  r              1  r     1  r        z       superscript  f  normal-′   z     f  z               1  r     1  r       {1-r\over 1+r}\leq\left|z{f^{\prime}(z)\over f(z)}\right|\leq{1+r\over 1-r}     with equality if and only if f is a Koebe function        f   (  z  )    =   z    (   1  -    e   i  θ    z    )   2     .        f  z     z   superscript    1     superscript  e    i  θ    z    2      f(z)={z\over(1-e^{i\theta}z)^{2}}.
