137 (number)

137 (one hundred [and] thirty-seven) is the natural number following 136 and preceding 138.
In mathematics
137 is the 33rd prime number; the next is 139, with which it comprises a twin prime, and thus 137 is a Chen prime.

137 is an Eisenstein prime with no imaginary part and a real part of the form 
 
 
 
 .
137 is the fourth Stern prime.
137 is a pythagorean prime.
137 is a strong prime in the sense that it is more than the arithmetic mean of its two neighboring primes.
Using two radii to divide a circle according to the golden ratio yields sectors of approximately 137° (the golden angle) and 222°.
137 is a strictly non-palindromic number and a primeval number.

In physics

The fine structure constant, a dimensionless physical constant, approximates 1/137, and the astronomer Arthur Eddington conjectured in 1929 that its reciprocal was in fact precisely the integer 137, which he claimed could be "obtained by pure deduction".1 This conjecture was not widely adopted, and by the 1940s, the experimental values for the constant were clearly inconsistent with it (i.e. closer to 137.036).2


In the Bohr model, the innermost electron of an atom with Z = 137 would be orbiting (just below) the speed of light, and the next element (Z = 138) would be "impossible". Since the Bohr model does not include either quantum mechanics or special relativity, the fact it breaks down in this regime is not surprising. However, such large atoms (if their nuclei were stable) could be expected to behave rather differently from a naive extrapolation of trends in the periodic table.

In esoterism

The fine structure constant of physics continues to convince esotericists that the universe has numerological fine tuning:3 for example the age of the universe could be considered as roughly 137 times the square of a myriad of years.
The Hebrew word קבלה (Kabbalah) takes a Gematria value of 137. Kabbalah is generally taken to mean "receiving," as evident from its root in Hebrew k-b-l (kof-beit-lamed), to "receive". Nevertheless, an additional nuance of meaning can be derived from the first appearance of its root (k-b-l) in the Torah. In Exodus 26:5 and 36:12, the root k-b-l appears to imply a state of “corresponding” rather than “receiving.” It is used to describe the “corresponding loops” which, when clasped together, enjoined the two sections of the Tabernacle’s ceiling. These loops were suspended directly over the veil that divided the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. Symbolically, this is the threshold between the physical dimension and the utterly spiritual dimension. In other words, at the boundary line of the physical world, the number 137 emerges.
