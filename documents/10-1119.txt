   Psoralen synthase      Psoralen synthase   In enzymology , a psoralen synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (+)-marmesin + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   psoralen + NADP + + acetone + 2 H 2 O   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are (+)- marmesin , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its 4 products are psoralen , NADP + , acetone , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (?) . This enzyme is also called CYP71AJ1 .  References     "  Category:EC 1.14.13  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
