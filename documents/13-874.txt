   Prosolvable group      Prosolvable group   In mathematics , more precisely in algebra , a prosolvable group (less common: prosoluble group ) is a group that is isomorphic to the inverse limit of an inverse system of solvable groups . Equivalently, a group is called prosolvable , if, viewed as a topological group , every open neighborhood of the identity contains a normal subgroup whose corresponding quotient group is a solvable group.  Examples   Let p be a prime , and denote the field of p-adic numbers , as usually, by    𝐐  p     subscript  𝐐  p    \mathbf{Q}_{p}   . Then the Galois group     Gal   (     𝐐  ¯   p   /   𝐐  p    )       Gal     subscript   normal-¯  𝐐   p    subscript  𝐐  p      \text{Gal}(\overline{\mathbf{Q}}_{p}/\mathbf{Q}_{p})   , where     𝐐  ¯   p     subscript   normal-¯  𝐐   p    \overline{\mathbf{Q}}_{p}   denotes the algebraic closure of    𝐐  p     subscript  𝐐  p    \mathbf{Q}_{p}   , is prosolvable. This follows from the fact that, for any finite Galois extension    L   L   L   of    𝐐  p     subscript  𝐐  p    \mathbf{Q}_{p}   , the Galois group    Gal   (   L  /   𝐐  p    )       Gal    L   subscript  𝐐  p      \text{Gal}(L/\mathbf{Q}_{p})   can be written as semidirect product      Gal   (   L  /   𝐐  p    )    =    (   R  ⋊  Q   )   ⋊  P         Gal    L   subscript  𝐐  p      right-normal-factor-semidirect-product   right-normal-factor-semidirect-product  R  Q   P     \text{Gal}(L/\mathbf{Q}_{p})=(R\rtimes Q)\rtimes P   , with   P   P   P   cyclic of order   f   f   f   for some    f  ∈  𝐍      f  𝐍    f\in\mathbf{N}   ,   Q   Q   Q    cyclic of order dividing     p  f   -  1       superscript  p  f   1    p^{f}-1   , and   R   R   R   of   p   p   p   -power order. Therefore,    Gal   (   L  /   𝐐  p    )       Gal    L   subscript  𝐐  p      \text{Gal}(L/\mathbf{Q}_{p})   is solvable. 1   See also   Galois theory   References  "  Category:Mathematical structures  Category:Algebra  Category:Number theory  Category:Topology  Category:Properties of groups  Category:Topological groups     ↩
