Prosolvable group

In mathematics, more precisely in algebra, a prosolvable group (less common: prosoluble group) is a group that is isomorphic to the inverse limit of an inverse system of solvable groups. Equivalently, a group is called prosolvable, if, viewed as a topological group, every open neighborhood of the identity contains a normal subgroup whose corresponding quotient group is a solvable group.
Examples

Let p be a prime, and denote the field of p-adic numbers, as usually, by 
 
 
 
 . Then the Galois group

 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the algebraic closure of 
 
 
 
 
 , is prosolvable. This follows from the fact that, for any finite Galois extension

 
  of 
 
 
 
 , the Galois group 
 
 
 
  can be written as semidirect product

 
 , with 
 
 
 
 
  cyclic of order 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
cyclic of order dividing 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 -power order. Therefore, 
 
 
 
  is solvable.1
