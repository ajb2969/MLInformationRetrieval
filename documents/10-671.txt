   3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase      3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ( R )-3-hydroxybutanoate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetoacetate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ( R )-3-hydroxybutanoate and NAD + , whereas its three products are acetoacetate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , to be specific, those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ( R )-3-hydroxybutanoate:NAD + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include NAD + - beta -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase , hydroxybutyrate oxidoreductase , beta -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase , D - beta -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase , D -3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase , D -(–)-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase , beta -hydroxybutyric acid dehydrogenase , 3- D -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase , and beta -hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies and butanoate metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
