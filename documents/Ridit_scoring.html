<h1>Ridit scoring</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="econometrics" title="wikilink">econometrics</a>, <strong>ridit scoring</strong> is a statistical method used to analyze ordered qualitative measurements. The tools of ridit analysis were developed and first applied by Bross,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> who coined the term "ridit" by analogy with other statistical transformations such as <a class="uri" href="probit" title="wikilink">probit</a> and <a class="uri" href="logit" title="wikilink">logit</a>.</p>

<p>Since ridit scoring is used to compare two or more sets of ordered qualitative data, one set is designated as a reference against which other sets can be compared. In econometric studies, for example, the ridit scores measuring taste survey answers of a competing or historically important product are often used as the reference data set against which taste surveys of new products are compared. Absent a convenient reference data set, an accumulation of pooled data from several sets or even an artificial or hypothetical set can be used.</p>
<h3 id="determining-the-probability-function">Determining the probability function</h3>

<p>After a reference data set has been chosen, the reference data set must be converted to a probability function. To do this, let <em>x<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>x<sub>2</sub></em>,..., <em>x<sub>n</sub></em> denote the ordered categories of the preference scale. For each <em>j</em>, <em>x<sub>j</sub></em> represents a choice or judgment. Then, let the probability function <em>p</em> be defined with respect to the reference data set as</p>

<p>The ridit scores, or simply ridits, of the reference data set are then easily calculated as</p>

<p><span class="LaTeX">$$w_j=0.5p_j+\sum_{k<j}{p_k}.< math="">

Each of the categories of the reference data set are then associated with a ridit score.
More formally, for each <math>1\le j\le n$$</math></j}{p_k}.<></span>, the value <em>w<sub>j</sub></em> is the ridit score of the choice <em>x<sub>j</sub></em>.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation-and-examples">Interpretation and examples</h2>

<p>Intuitively, ridit scoring can be understood as a modified notion of percentile. For any j, if <em>x<sub>j</sub></em> has a low (close to 0) ridit score, one can conclude that</p>

<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\sum_{k<j}{prob(x_k)}< math="">
is very small, which is to say that very few respondents have chosen a category "lower" than ''x<sub>j</sub>''.

==Applications==
Ridit scoring has found use primarily in the [[health science]]s (including nursing and [[epidemiology]]) and econometric preference studies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==A mathematical approach==
Besides having intuitive appeal, the derivation for ridit scoring can be arrived at with mathematically rigorous methods as well. Brockett and Levine<ref>Brockett, Patrick L. and Levine, Arnold (1977) "On a Characterization of Ridits," ''The Annals of Statistics'', 5 (6):1245-1248 {{jstor|2958658}}
</ref> presented a derivation of the above ridit score equations based on several intuitively uncontroversial mathematical postulates.
