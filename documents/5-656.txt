   Common drain      Common drain   In electronics , a common-drain  amplifier , also known as a source follower , is one of three basic single-stage field effect transistor (FET) amplifier topologies, typically used as a voltage  buffer . In this circuit (NMOS) the gate terminal of the transistor serves as the input, the source is the output, and the drain is common to both (input and output), hence its name. The analogous bipolar junction transistor circuit is the common-collector amplifier . This circuit is also commonly called a "stabilizer."  In addition, this circuit is used to transform impedances . For example, the Thévenin resistance of a combination of a voltage follower driven by a voltage source with high Thévenin resistance is reduced to only the output resistance of the voltage follower (a small resistance). That resistance reduction makes the combination a more ideal voltage source. Conversely, a voltage follower inserted between a driving stage and a high load (i.e. a low resistance) presents an infinite resistance (low load) to the driving stage—an advantage in coupling a voltage signal to a large load.  Characteristics  At low frequencies, the source follower pictured at right has the following small signal characteristics. 1       Definition   Expression   Approximate expression   Conditions       Current gain        A  i   =    i  out    i  in         subscript  A  normal-i      subscript  i  out    subscript  i  in      {A_{\mathrm{i}}}={i_{\mathrm{out}}\over i_{\mathrm{in}}}         ∞     \infty         ∞     \infty         Voltage gain        A  v   =    v  out    v  in         subscript  A  normal-v      subscript  v  out    subscript  v  in      {A_{\mathrm{v}}}={v_{\mathrm{out}}\over v_{\mathrm{in}}}            g  m    R  S       g  m    R  S    +  1          subscript  g  m    subscript  R  S         subscript  g  m    subscript  R  S    1     \frac{g_{m}R_{\text{S}}}{g_{m}R_{\text{S}}+1}           ≈  1      absent  1    \approx 1          (     g  m    R  S    ≫  1   )     much-greater-than     subscript  g  m    subscript  R  S    1    (g_{m}R_{\text{S}}\gg 1)        Input resistance        r  in   =    v   i  n     i   i  n          subscript  r  in      subscript  v    i  n     subscript  i    i  n       r_{\mathrm{in}}=\frac{v_{in}}{i_{in}}         ∞     \infty         ∞     \infty         Output resistance        r  out   =    v   o  u  t     i   o  u  t          subscript  r  out      subscript  v    o  u  t     subscript  i    o  u  t       r_{\mathrm{out}}=\frac{v_{out}}{i_{out}}           R  S   ∥   1   g  m    =    R  S      g  m    R  S    +  1       fragments   subscript  R  S   parallel-to    1   subscript  g  m        subscript  R  S        subscript  g  m    subscript  R  S    1      R_{\text{S}}\|\frac{1}{g_{m}}=\frac{R_{\text{S}}}{g_{m}R_{\text{S}}+1}           ≈   1   g  m        absent    1   subscript  g  m      \approx\frac{1}{g_{m}}          (     g  m    R  S    ≫  1   )     much-greater-than     subscript  g  m    subscript  R  S    1    (g_{m}R_{S}\gg 1)        The variable g m that is not listed in the schematic is the transconductance of the device (usually given in units of siemens ).
