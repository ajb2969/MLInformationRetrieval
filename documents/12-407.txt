   Slowly varying function      Slowly varying function   In real analysis , a branch of mathematics , a slowly varying function is a function resembling a function converging at infinity. A regularly varying function resembles a power law function ( polynomial ) near infinity. Slowly varying and regularly varying functions are important in probability theory .  Definition  A function L : (0,∞) → (0, ∞) is called slowly varying (at infinity) if for all a > 0,        lim   x  →  ∞      L   (   a  x   )     L   (  x  )      =  1.        subscript    normal-→  x         L    a  x      L  x     1.    \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{L(ax)}{L(x)}=1.     If the limit       g   (  a  )    =    lim   x  →  ∞      L   (   a  x   )     L   (  x  )            g  a     subscript    normal-→  x         L    a  x      L  x       g(a)=\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{L(ax)}{L(x)}   is finite but nonzero for every a > 0, the function L is called a regularly varying function .  These definitions are due to Jovan Karamata . Regular variation is the subject of  Examples   If L has a limit            lim   x  →  ∞     L   (  x  )     =  b  ∈   (  0  ,  ∞  )    ,          subscript    normal-→  x       L  x    b        0       \lim_{x\to\infty}L(x)=b\in(0,\infty),       then L is a slowly varying function.    For any β ∈ R , the function L ( x )= log β  x is slowly varying.  The function L ( x )= x is not slowly varying, neither is L ( x )= x β for any real β ≠0. However, they are regularly varying.   Properties  Some important properties are :   The limit in the definition is uniform if a is restricted to a finite interval.  Karamata's characterization theorem : every regularly varying function is of the form x  β L ( x ) where β ≥ 0 and L is a slowly varying function. That is, the function g ( a ) in the definition has to be of the form a ρ ; the number ρ is called the index of regular variation.  Karamata representation theorem : a function L is slowly varying if and only if there exists B > 0 such that for all x ≥ B the function can be written in the form          L   (  x  )    =   exp   (    η   (  x  )    +    ∫  B  x       ε   (  t  )    t    d  t     )          L  x         η  x     superscript   subscript   B   x         ε  t   t   d  t        L(x)=\exp\left(\eta(x)+\int_{B}^{x}\frac{\varepsilon(t)}{t}\,dt\right)         where η ( x ) converges to a finite number and ε ( x ) converges to zero as x goes to infinity, and both functions are measurable and bounded.
