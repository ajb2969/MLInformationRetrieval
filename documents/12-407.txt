Slowly varying function

In real analysis, a branch of mathematics, a slowly varying function is a function resembling a function converging at infinity. A regularly varying function resembles a power law function (polynomial) near infinity. Slowly varying and regularly varying functions are important in probability theory.
Definition
A function L: (0,∞) → (0, ∞) is called slowly varying (at infinity) if for all a > 0,



If the limit


 
  is finite but nonzero for every a > 0, the function L is called a regularly varying function.
These definitions are due to Jovan Karamata . Regular variation is the subject of 
Examples

If L has a limit








then L is a slowly varying function.
 


For any β∈R, the function L(x)= logβ x is slowly varying.
The function L(x)=x is not slowly varying, neither is L(x)=xβ for any real β≠0. However, they are regularly varying.

Properties
Some important properties are :

The limit in the definition is uniform if a is restricted to a finite interval.
Karamata's characterization theorem: every regularly varying function is of the form x βL(x) where β ≥ 0 and L is a slowly varying function. That is, the function g(a) in the definition has to be of the form aρ; the number ρ is called the index of regular variation.
Karamata representation theorem: a function L is slowly varying if and only if there exists B > 0 such that for all x ≥ B the function can be written in the form










where η(x) converges to a finite number and ε(x) converges to zero as x goes to infinity, and both functions are measurable and bounded.
