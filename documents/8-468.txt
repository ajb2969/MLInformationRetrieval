   C-mole      C-mole   '''C-mole '''is an abbreviation for a Carbon Mole . A C-mole of an organic or generalised compound is defined as the number of carbon atoms expressed as multiple of the Avogadro constant .  Examples  1 mole of glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) is equivalent to 6 C-moles of glucose. The concept is often used to keep track of mass balances in work with organisms, where the frequency of other chemical elements is expressed relative to that of carbon. Using C-moles, the chemical formula for glucose then simplifies to    C   H  2   O      C   subscript  H  2   O    CH_{2}O   .  The concept becomes useful in more complex situations, such as generalized compounds , where the exact chemical composition is not known.  "  Category:Units of amount of substance
