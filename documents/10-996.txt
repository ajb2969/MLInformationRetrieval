   3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridinecarboxylate dioxygenase      3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridinecarboxylate dioxygenase   In enzymology , a 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridinecarboxylate dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-5-carboxylate + NAD(P)H + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-(acetamidomethylene)succinate + NAD(P)+   The 5 substrates of this enzyme are 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-5-carboxylate , NADH , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 2-(acetamidomethylene)succinate , NAD + , and NADP + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-5-carboxylate,NAD(P)H:oxygen oxidoreductase (decyclizing) . Other names in common use include methylhydroxypyridinecarboxylate oxidase , 2-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine 5-carboxylic acid dioxygenase , methylhydroxypyridine carboxylate dioxygenase , and 3-hydroxy-3-methylpyridinecarboxylate dioxygenase [incorrect] . This enzyme participates in vitamin B 6  metabolism . It employs one cofactor , FAD .
