Malonyl-S-ACP:biotin-protein carboxyltransferase

Malonyl-S-ACP:biotin-protein carboxyltransferase (, malonyl-S-acyl-carrier protein:biotin-protein carboxyltransferase, MadC/MadD, MadC,D, malonyl-[acyl-carrier protein]:biotinyl-[protein] carboxyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name malonyl-(acyl-carrier protein):biotinyl-(protein) carboxytransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

malonyl-[acyl-carrier protein] + biotinyl-[protein] 
 
 
 
  acetyl-[acyl-carrier protein] + carboxybiotinyl-[protein]
 

This enzyme is a component of EC 4.1.1.89, biotin-dependent malonate decarboxylase.
