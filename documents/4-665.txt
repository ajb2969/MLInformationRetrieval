   Alternating finite automaton      Alternating finite automaton   In automata theory , an alternating finite automaton (AFA) is a nondeterministic finite automaton whose transitions are divided into existential and universal transitions. For example, let A be an alternating automaton .   For an existential transition    (  q  ,  a  ,    q  1   ∨   q  2    )     q  a     subscript  q  1    subscript  q  2      (q,a,q_{1}\vee q_{2})   , A nondeterministically chooses to switch the state to either    q  1     subscript  q  1    q_{1}   or    q  2     subscript  q  2    q_{2}   , reading a . Thus, behaving like a regular nondeterministic finite automaton .  For a universal transition    (  q  ,  a  ,    q  1   ∧   q  2    )     q  a     subscript  q  1    subscript  q  2      (q,a,q_{1}\wedge q_{2})   , A moves to    q  1     subscript  q  1    q_{1}    and     q  2     subscript  q  2    q_{2}   , reading a , simulating the behavior of a parallel machine.   Note that due to the universal quantification a run is represented by a run tree . A accepts a word w , if there exists a run tree on w such that every path ends in an accepting state.  A basic theorem states that any AFA is equivalent to a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) by performing a similar kind of powerset construction as it is used for the transformation of an NFA to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). This construction converts an AFA with k states to an NFA with up to    2  k     superscript  2  k    2^{k}   states.  An alternative model which is frequently used is the one where Boolean combinations are represented as clauses . For instance, one could assume the combinations to be in disjunctive normal form so that    {   {   q  1   }   ,   {   q  2   ,   q  3   }   }       subscript  q  1      subscript  q  2    subscript  q  3      \{\{q_{1}\},\{q_{2},q_{3}\}\}   would represent     q  1   ∨   (    q  2   ∧   q  3    )        subscript  q  1      subscript  q  2    subscript  q  3      q_{1}\vee(q_{2}\wedge q_{3})   . The state tt ( true ) is represented by    {   {  }   }        \{\{\}\}   in this case and ff ( false ) by   ∅     \varnothing   . This clause representation is usually more efficient.  Formal Definition  An alternating finite automaton (AFA) is a 6-tuple ,    (   S   (  ∃  )    ,   S   (  ∀  )    ,  Σ  ,  δ  ,   P  0   ,  F  )       S      S  for-all   normal-Σ  δ   subscript  P  0   F    (S(\exists),S(\forall),\Sigma,\delta,P_{0},F)   , where       S   (  ∃  )       S     S(\exists)   is a finite set of existential states. Also commonly represented as    S   (  ∨  )       S     S(\vee)   .      S   (  ∀  )       S  for-all    S(\forall)   is a finite set of universal states. Also commonly represented as    S   (  ∧  )       S     S(\wedge)   .      Σ    normal-Σ   \ \Sigma   is a finite set of input symbols.      δ    δ   \ \delta   is a set of transition functions to next state      (    S   (  ∃  )    ∪   S   (  ∀  )     )   ×   (   Σ  ∪   {  ε  }    )    →   2    S   (  ∃  )    ∪   S   (  ∀  )         normal-→        S      S  for-all      normal-Σ   ε      superscript  2      S      S  for-all       (S(\exists)\cup S(\forall))\times(\Sigma\cup\{\varepsilon\})\to 2^{S(\exists)%
 \cup S(\forall)}   .       P   0     subscript  P  0    \ P_{0}   is the initial (start) state, such that     P  0   ∈    S   (  ∃  )    ∪   S   (  ∀  )          subscript  P  0       S      S  for-all      P_{0}\in S(\exists)\cup S(\forall)   .      F    F   \ F   is a set of accepting (final) states such that    F  ⊆    S   (  ∃  )    ∪   S   (  ∀  )         F      S      S  for-all      F\subseteq S(\exists)\cup S(\forall)   .
