Shear modulus




Shear modulus

 In materials science, shear modulus or modulus of rigidity, denoted by G, or sometimes S or μ, is defined as the ratio of shear stress to the shear strain:1



where


 
  = shear stress;


 
  is the force which acts


 
  is the area on which the force acts

in engineering, 
 
 
 
  = shear strain. Elsewhere, 
 
 



 
  is the transverse displacement
 


 
  is the initial length
 

Shear modulus' derived SI unit is the pascal (Pa), although it is usually expressed in gigapascals (GPa) or in thousands of pounds per square inch (ksi). Its dimensional form is M1L−1T−2.
The shear modulus is always positive.

The shear modulus is one of several quantities for measuring the stiffness of materials. All of them arise in the generalized Hooke's law:

Young's modulus describes the material's response to uniaxial stress (like pulling on the ends of a wire or putting a weight on top of a column),
the bulk modulus describes the material's response to uniform pressure (like the pressure at the bottom of the ocean or a deep swimming pool)
the shear modulus describes the material's response to shear stress (like cutting it with dull scissors).

The shear modulus is concerned with the deformation of a solid when it experiences a force parallel to one of its surfaces while its opposite face experiences an opposing force (such as friction). In the case of an object that's shaped like a rectangular prism, it will deform into a parallelepiped. Anisotropic materials such as wood, paper and also essentially all single crystals exhibit differing material response to stress or strain when tested in different directions. In this case one may need to use the full tensor-expression of the elastic constants, rather than a single scalar value.
One possible definition of a fluid would be a material with zero shear modulus.
Waves
 In homogeneous and isotropic solids, there are two kinds of waves, pressure waves and shear waves. The velocity of a shear wave, 
 
 
 
  is controlled by the shear modulus,


 
  where

G is the shear modulus
 


 
  is the solid's density.
 

Shear modulus of metals

The shear modulus of metals is usually observed to decrease with increasing temperature. At high pressures, the shear modulus also appears to increase with the applied pressure. Correlations between the melting temperature, vacancy formation energy, and the shear modulus have been observed in many metals.10
Several models exist that attempt to predict the shear modulus of metals (and possibly that of alloys). Shear modulus models that have been used in plastic flow computations include:

the MTS shear modulus model developed by11 and used in conjunction with the Mechanical Threshold Stress (MTS) plastic flow stress model.1213
the Steinberg-Cochran-Guinan (SCG) shear modulus model developed by14 and used in conjunction with the Steinberg-Cochran-Guinan-Lund (SCGL) flow stress model.
the Nadal and LePoac (NP) shear modulus model15 that uses Lindemann theory to determine the temperature dependence and the SCG model for pressure dependence of the shear modulus.

MTS shear modulus model
The MTS shear modulus model has the form:



where µ0 is the shear modulus at 0 K, and D and T0 are material constants.
SCG shear modulus model
The Steinberg-Cochran-Guinan (SCG) shear modulus model is pressure dependent and has the form


 
  where, µ0 is the shear modulus at the reference state (T = 300 K, p = 0, η = 1), p is the pressure, and T is the temperature.
NP shear modulus model
The Nadal-Le Poac (NP) shear modulus model is a modified version of the SCG model. The empirical temperature dependence of the shear modulus in the SCG model is replaced with an equation based on Lindemann melting theory. The NP shear modulus model has the form:



where



and µ0 is the shear modulus at 0 K and ambient pressure, ζ is a material parameter, kb is the Boltzmann constant, m is the atomic mass, and f is the Lindemann constant.
