   Shear modulus      Shear modulus   In materials science , shear modulus or modulus of rigidity , denoted by G , or sometimes S or Œº , is defined as the ratio of shear stress to the shear strain : 1       G     =  def      œÑ   x  y     Œ≥   x  y     =    F  /  A     Œî  x   /  l    =    F  l    A  Œî  x          superscript   def   G     subscript  œÑ    x  y     subscript  Œ≥    x  y              F  A       normal-Œî  x   l             F  l     A  normal-Œî  x       G\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{\tau_{xy}}{\gamma_{xy}}=\frac{F/A}{\Delta

All of them arise in the generalized Hooke's law :   Young's modulus describes the material's response to uniaxial stress (like pulling on the ends of a wire or putting a weight on top of a column),  the bulk modulus describes the material's response to uniform pressure (like the pressure at the bottom of the ocean or a deep swimming pool)  the shear modulus describes the material's response to shear stress (like cutting it with dull scissors).   The shear modulus is concerned with the deformation of a solid when it experiences a force parallel to one of its surfaces while its opposite face experiences an opposing force (such as friction). In the case of an object that's shaped like a rectangular prism, it will deform into a parallelepiped . Anisotropic materials such as wood , paper and also essentially all single crystals exhibit differing material response to stress or strain when tested in different directions. In this case one may need to use the full tensor-expression of the elastic constants, rather than a single scalar value.  One possible definition of a fluid would be a material with zero shear modulus.  Waves  In homogeneous and isotropic solids, there are two kinds of waves, pressure waves and shear waves . The velocity of a shear wave,    (   v  s   )     subscript  v  s    (v_{s})   is controlled by the shear modulus,       v  s   =    G  œÅ         subscript  v  s       G  œÅ      v_{s}=\sqrt{\frac{G}{\rho}}   where   G is the shear modulus     œÅ   œÅ   \rho   is the solid's density .   Shear modulus of metals  (Figure)  Shear modulus of copper as a function of temperature. The experimental data 8 9 are shown with colored symbols.   The shear modulus of metals is usually observed to decrease with increasing temperature. At high pressures, the shear modulus also appears to increase with the applied pressure. Correlations between the melting temperature, vacancy formation energy, and the shear modulus have been observed in many metals. 10  Several models exist that attempt to predict the shear modulus of metals (and possibly that of alloys). Shear modulus models that have been used in plastic flow computations include:   the MTS shear modulus model developed by 11 and used in conjunction with the Mechanical Threshold Stress (MTS) plastic flow stress model. 12 13  the Steinberg-Cochran-Guinan (SCG) shear modulus model developed by 14 and used in conjunction with the Steinberg-Cochran-Guinan-Lund (SCGL) flow stress model.  the Nadal and LePoac (NP) shear modulus model 15 that uses Lindemann theory to determine the temperature dependence and the SCG model for pressure dependence of the shear modulus.   MTS shear modulus model  The MTS shear modulus model has the form:       Œº   (  T  )    =    Œº  0   -   D    exp   (    T  0   /  T   )    -  1           Œº  T      subscript  Œº  0     D         subscript  T  0   T    1       \mu(T)=\mu_{0}-\frac{D}{\exp(T_{0}/T)-1}     where ¬µ 0 is the shear modulus at 0 K, and D and T 0 are material constants.  SCG shear modulus model  The Steinberg-Cochran-Guinan (SCG) shear modulus model is pressure dependent and has the form        Œº   (  p  ,  T  )    =    Œº  0   +     ‚àÇ  Œº    ‚àÇ  p     p   Œ∑   1  /  3      +     ‚àÇ  Œº    ‚àÇ  T     (   T  -  300   )      ;   Œ∑  :=   œÅ  /   œÅ  0        formulae-sequence      Œº   p  T       subscript  Œº  0         Œº     p      p   superscript  Œ∑    1  3            Œº     T      T  300       assign  Œ∑    œÅ   subscript  œÅ  0       \mu(p,T)=\mu_{0}+\frac{\partial\mu}{\partial p}\frac{p}{\eta^{1/3}}+\frac{%
 \partial\mu}{\partial T}(T-300);\quad\eta:=\rho/\rho_{0}   where, ¬µ 0 is the shear modulus at the reference state ( T = 300 K, p = 0, Œ∑ = 1), p is the pressure, and T is the temperature.  NP shear modulus model  The Nadal-Le Poac (NP) shear modulus model is a modified version of the SCG model. The empirical temperature dependence of the shear modulus in the SCG model is replaced with an equation based on Lindemann melting theory . The NP shear modulus model has the form:        Œº   (  p  ,  T  )    =    1   ùí•   (   T  ^   )      [     (    Œº  0   +     ‚àÇ  Œº    ‚àÇ  p     p   Œ∑   1  /  3       )    (   1  -   T  ^    )    +     œÅ   C  m       k  b    T    ]     ;   C  :=      (   6   œÄ  2    )    2  /  3    3    f  2        formulae-sequence      Œº   p  T        1    ùí•   normal-^  T      delimited-[]         subscript  Œº  0         Œº     p     continued-fraction  p   superscript  Œ∑    1  3         1   normal-^  T         œÅ    C  m     subscript  k  b   T        assign  C     continued-fraction   superscript    6   superscript  œÄ  2      2  3    3    superscript  f  2       \mu(p,T)=\frac{1}{\mathcal{J}(\hat{T})}\left[\left(\mu_{0}+\frac{\partial\mu}{%
