   Galactose 1-dehydrogenase (NADP+)      Galactose 1-dehydrogenase (NADP+)   In enzymology , a galactose 1-dehydrogenase (NADP + ) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-galactose + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-galactonolactone + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-galactose and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are D-galactonolactone , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-galactose:NADP + 1-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include D-galactose dehydrogenase (NADP + ) , and galactose 1-dehydrogenase (NADP + ) . This enzyme participates in galactose metabolism .  References        "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
