   Young's inequality      Young's inequality   In mathematics , Young's inequality is either of two inequalities : one about the product of two numbers, 1 and one about the convolution of two functions. 2 They are named after William Henry Young .  Young's inequality for products can be used to prove Hölder's inequality . It is also used widely to estimate the norm of nonlinear terms in PDE theory , since it allows one to estimate a product of two terms by a sum of the same terms raised to a power and scaled.  Young's inequality for products  Standard version for conjugate Hölder exponents  In its standard form, the inequality states that if a and b are nonnegative  real numbers and p and q are positive real numbers such that 1/ p + 1/ q = 1, then  $$ab \le \frac{a^p}{p} + \frac{b^q}{q}.$$  Equality holds if and only if a p = b q . This form of Young's inequality is a special case of the inequality of weighted arithmetic and geometric means and can be used to prove Hölder's inequality .    Proof    The claim is certainly true if a = 0 or b = 0. Therefore, assume a > 0 and b > 0 in the following. Put t = 1/ p , and (1 − t ) = 1/ q . Then since the logarithm function is strictly concave  $$\log(t a^p + (1-t) b^q) \ge t \log(a^p) + (1-t) \log(b^q) =
                           \log(a) +\log(b) = \log(ab)$$  with equality if and only if a p = b q . Young's inequality follows by exponentiating.    Elementary case  An elementary case of Young's inequality is the inequality with exponent 2,  $$ab \le \frac{a^2}{2} + \frac{b^2}{2},$$  which also gives rise to the so-called Young's inequality with ε (valid for every ε > 0), sometimes called the Peter–Paul inequality . 3 This name refers to the fact that tighter control of the second term is achieved at the cost of losing some control of the first term – one must "rob Peter to pay Paul"  $$ab \le \frac{a^2}{2\varepsilon} + \frac{\varepsilon b^2}{2}.$$    Proof    Young's inequality with exponent 2 is the special case p = q = 2. However, it has a more elementary proof, just observe that  $$0\le (a-b)^2=a^2+b^2-2ab,$$  add 2 ab to every side and divide by 2.  Young's inequality with ε follows by applying Young's inequality with exponent 2 to  $$a'=a/\sqrt{\varepsilon},\text{ }b'=\sqrt{\varepsilon}b.$$    Standard version for increasing functions  For the standard version 4 5 of the inequality, let f denote a real-valued, continuous and strictly increasing function on [0, c ] with c > 0 and f (0) = 0. Let f −1 denote the inverse function of f . Then, for all a ∈ [0, c ] and b ∈ [0, f ( c )],  $$ab \le \int_0^a f(x)\,dx + \int_0^b f^{-1}(x)\,dx$$  with equality if and only if b = f ( a ).  Generalization using Fenchel-Legendre transforms  If f is a convex function and its Legendre transform ( convex conjugate ) is denoted by g , then  $$ab \le f(a) + g(b). \,$$ This follows immediately from the definition of the Legendre transform.  More generally, if f is a convex function defined on a real vector space $X$ and its convex conjugate is denoted by $f^\star$ (and is defined on the dual space  $X^\star$ ), then  $$\langle u, v \rangle \le f^\star(u) + f(v).$$ where $\langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle : X^\star \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ is the dual pairing .  Examples   The Legendre transform of f ( a ) = a p / p is g ( b ) = b q / q with q such that 1/ p + 1/ q = 1, and thus Young's inequality for conjugate Hölder exponents mentioned above is a special case.  The Legendre transform of f ( a ) = e a – 1 is g ( b ) = 1 − b + b ln b , hence ab ≤ e a − b + b ln b for all non-negative a and b . This estimate is useful in large deviations theory under exponential moment conditions, because b ln b appears in the definition of relative entropy , which is the rate function in Sanov's theorem .   Young's inequality for convolutions  In real analysis , the following result is also called Young's inequality: 6  Suppose f is in L p ( R d ) and g is in L q ( R d ) and  $$\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{r} +1$$  with 1 ≤ p , q , r ≤ ∞. Then  $$\|f*g\| _r\le\|f\|_p\|g\|_q.$$  Here the star denotes convolution , L p is Lebesgue space , and  $$\|f\|_p = \Bigl(\int |f(x)|^p\,dx \Bigr)^{1/p}$$  denotes the usual L p norm.  An example application is that Young's inequality can be used to show that the heat semigroup is a contracting semigroup using the L 2 norm (i.e. the Weierstrass transform does not enlarge the L 2 norm).  In case p , q > 1 Young's inequality can be strengthened to a sharp form, viz  $$\|f*g\| _r\le c_{p,q} \|f\|_p\|g\|_q.$$  where the constant c p , q   See also   Convex conjugate  Legendre transformation   Notes  External links   ''Young's Inequality at PlanetMath    "  Category:Inequalities  Category:Articles containing proofs     ↩  ↩  , ↩  , Chapter 4.8 ↩  , Theorem 2.9 ↩  , Theorem 3.9.4 ↩
