   Homoserine O-succinyltransferase      Homoserine O-succinyltransferase   In enzymology , a homoserine O-succinyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   succinyl-CoA + L-homoserine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + O-succinyl-L-homoserine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are succinyl-CoA and L-homoserine , whereas its two products are CoA and O-succinyl-L-homoserine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is succinyl-CoA:L-homoserine O-succinyltransferase . Other names in common use include homoserine O-transsuccinylase , and homoserine succinyltransferase . This enzyme participates in methionine metabolism and sulfur metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
