   Union (set theory)      Union (set theory)   In set theory , the union (denoted by ∪) of a collection of sets is the set of all distinct elements in the collection. 1 It is one of the fundamental operations through which sets can be combined and related to each other.  Union of two sets  The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A , in B , or in both A and B . In symbols,       A  ∪  B   =   {  x  :   x  ∈   A  or  x   ∈  B   }         A  B    conditional-set  x      x    A  or  x        B       A\cup B=\{x:x\in A\text{ or }x\in B\}   .  For example, if A = {1, 3, 5, 7} and B = {1, 2, 4, 6} then A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. A more elaborate example (involving two infinite sets) is:   A = { x is an even integer larger than 1}  B = { x is an odd integer larger than 1}       A  ∪  B   =   {  2  ,  3  ,  4  ,  5  ,  6  ,  …  }         A  B    2  3  4  5  6  normal-…     A\cup B=\{2,3,4,5,6,\dots\}      Sets cannot have duplicate elements, so the union of the sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4} is {1, 2, 3, 4}. Multiple occurrences of identical elements have no effect on the cardinality of a set or its contents.  The number 9 is not contained in the union of the set of prime numbers {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, …} and the set of even numbers {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, …}, because 9 is neither prime nor even.  Algebraic properties  Binary union is an associative operation; that is,   A ∪ ( B ∪ C ) = ( A ∪ B ) ∪ C .   The operations can be performed in any order, and the parentheses may be omitted without ambiguity (i.e., either of the above can be expressed equivalently as A ∪ B ∪ C ). Similarly, union is commutative , so the sets can be written in any order.  The empty set is an identity element for the operation of union. That is, A ∪ ∅ = A , for any set A .  These facts follow from analogous facts about logical disjunction .  Finite unions  One can take the union of several sets simultaneously. For example, the union of three sets A , B , and C contains all elements of A , all elements of B , and all elements of C , and nothing else. Thus, x is an element of A ∪ B ∪ C if and only if x is in at least one of A , B , and C .  In mathematics a finite union means any union carried out on a finite number of sets: it doesn't imply that the union set is a finite set .  Arbitrary unions  The most general notion is the union of an arbitrary collection of sets, sometimes called an infinitary union . If M is a set whose elements are themselves sets, then x is an element of the union of M  if and only if there is at least one element A of M such that x is an element of A . In symbols:        x  ∈   ⋃  𝐌    ⇔     ∃  A   ∈  𝐌   ,   x  ∈  A     .     iff    x    𝐌     formulae-sequence      A   𝐌     x  A      x\in\bigcup\mathbf{M}\iff\exists A\in\mathbf{M},\ x\in A.   That this union of M is a set no matter how large a set M itself might be, is the content of the axiom of union in axiomatic set theory .  This idea subsumes the preceding sections, in that (for example) A ∪ B ∪ C is the union of the collection { A , B , C }. Also, if M is the empty collection, then the union of M is the empty set. The analogy between finite unions and logical disjunction extends to one between arbitrary unions and existential quantification .  Notations  The notation for the general concept can vary considerably. For a finite union of sets     S  1   ,   S  2   ,   S  3   ,  …  ,   S  n       subscript  S  1    subscript  S  2    subscript  S  3   normal-…   subscript  S  n     S_{1},S_{2},S_{3},\dots,S_{n}\,\!   one often writes     S  1   ∪   S  2   ∪   S  3   ∪  …  ∪   S  n        subscript  S  1    subscript  S  2    subscript  S  3   normal-…   subscript  S  n     S_{1}\cup S_{2}\cup S_{3}\cup\dots\cup S_{n}   . Various common notations for arbitrary unions include    ⋃  𝐌      𝐌    \bigcup\mathbf{M}   ,     ⋃   A  ∈  𝐌    A      subscript     A  𝐌    A    \bigcup_{A\in\mathbf{M}}A   , and     ⋃   i  ∈  I     A  i       subscript     i  I     subscript  A  i     \bigcup_{i\in I}A_{i}   , the last of which refers to the union of the collection    {   A  i   :   i  ∈  I   }     conditional-set   subscript  A  i     i  I     \left\{A_{i}:i\in I\right\}   where I is an index set and    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   is a set for every    i  ∈  I      i  I    i\in I   . In the case that the index set I is the set of natural numbers , one uses a notation     ⋃   i  =  1   ∞    A  i       superscript   subscript     i  1       subscript  A  i     \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i}   analogous to that of the infinite series . When formatting is difficult, this can also be written " A 1 ∪ A 2 ∪ A 3 ∪ ···". (This last example, a union of countably many sets, is very common in analysis ; for an example see the article on σ-algebras .)  Whenever the symbol "∪" is placed before other symbols instead of between them, it is of a larger size.  Union and intersection  Since sets with unions and intersections form a Boolean algebra , Intersection distributes over union:       A  ∩   (   B  ∪  C   )    =    (   A  ∩  B   )   ∪   (   A  ∩  C   )          A    B  C        A  B     A  C      A\cap(B\cup C)=(A\cap B)\cup(A\cap C)   ; and union distributes over intersection:       A  ∪   (   B  ∩  C   )    =    (   A  ∪  B   )   ∩   (   A  ∪  C   )          A    B  C        A  B     A  C      A\cup(B\cap C)=(A\cup B)\cap(A\cup C)   .  Within a given universal set , union can be written in terms of the operations of intersection and complement as       A  ∪  B   =    (    A  C   ∩   B  C    )   C         A  B    superscript     superscript  A  C    superscript  B  C    C     A\cup B=\left(A^{C}\cap B^{C}\right)^{C}   where the superscript C denotes the complement with respect to the universal set.  Arbitrary union and intersection also satisfy the law        ⋃   i  ∈  I     (    ⋂   j  ∈  J     A   i  ,  j     )    ⊆    ⋂   j  ∈  J     (    ⋃   i  ∈  I     A   i  ,  j     )          subscript     i  I      subscript     j  J     subscript  A   i  j        subscript     j  J      subscript     i  I     subscript  A   i  j        \bigcup_{i\in I}\bigg(\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{i,j}\bigg)\subseteq\bigcap_{j\in J}%
 \bigg(\bigcup_{i\in I}A_{i,j}\bigg)   .
