   Peptide-aspartate beta-dioxygenase      Peptide-aspartate beta-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a peptide-aspartate beta-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   peptide-L-aspartate + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   peptide-3-hydroxy-L-aspartate + succinate + CO 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are peptide-L-aspartate , 2-oxoglutarate , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are peptide-3-hydroxy-L-aspartate , succinate , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is peptide-L-aspartate,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating) . Other names in common use include aspartate beta-hydroxylase , and aspartylpeptide beta-dioxygenase . It employs one cofactor , iron .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
