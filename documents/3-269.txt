Laplace transform applied to differential equations

The Laplace transform is a powerful integral transform used to switch a function from the time domain to the s-domain. The Laplace transform can be used in some cases to solve linear differential equations with given initial conditions.
First consider the following property of the Laplace transform:






One can prove by induction that



Now we consider the following differential equation:



with given initial conditions



Using the linearity of the Laplace transform it is equivalent to rewrite the equation as



obtaining



Solving the equation for 
 
 
 
  and substituting 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  one obtains



The solution for f(t) is obtained by applying the inverse Laplace transform to 
 
 

Note that if the initial conditions are all zero, i.e.



then the formula simplifies to



An example
We want to solve



with initial conditions f(0) = 0 and fâ€²(0)=0.
We note that



and we get



The equation is then equivalent to



We deduce



Now we apply the Laplace inverse transform to get
