   Wiener's tauberian theorem      Wiener's tauberian theorem   In mathematical analysis , Wiener's tauberian theorem is any of several related results proved by Norbert Wiener in 1932. 1 They provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which any function in or can be approximated by linear combinations of translations of a given function. 2  Informally, if the Fourier transform of a function   f   f   f   vanishes on a certain set   Z   Z   Z   , the Fourier transform of any linear combination of translations of   f   f   f   also vanishes on   Z   Z   Z   . Therefore the linear combinations of translations of   f   f   f   can not approximate a function whose Fourier transform does not vanish on   Z   Z   Z   .  Wiener's theorems make this precise, stating that linear combinations of translations of   f   f   f   are dense if and only the zero set of the Fourier transform of   f   f   f   is empty (in the case of ) or of Lebesgue measure zero (in the case of ).  Gelfand reformulated Wiener's theorem in terms of commutative C*-algebras , when it states that the spectrum of the L 1 group ring L 1 ( R ) of the group R of real numbers is the dual group of R . A similar result is true when R is replaced by any locally compact abelian group .  The condition in  Let be an integrable function. The span of translations =    f   (   x  +  a   )       f    x  a     f(x+a)   is dense in if and only if the Fourier transform of   f   f   f   has no real zeros.  Tauberian reformulation  The following statement is equivalent to the previous result, and explains why Wiener's result is a Tauberian theorem :  Suppose the Fourier transform of has no real zeros, and suppose the convolution    f  *  h      f  h    f*h   tends to zero at infinity for some . Then the convolution    g  *  h      g  h    g*h   tends to zero at infinity for any .  More generally, if        lim   x  →  ∞      (   f  *  h   )    (  x  )     =   A   ∫   f   (  x  )   d  x           subscript    normal-→  x         f  h   x      A      f  x  d  x       \lim_{x\to\infty}(f*h)(x)=A\int f(x)\,dx     for some the Fourier transform of which has no real zeros, then also        lim   x  →  ∞      (   g  *  h   )    (  x  )     =   A   ∫   g   (  x  )   d  x           subscript    normal-→  x         g  h   x      A      g  x  d  x       \lim_{x\to\infty}(g*h)(x)=A\int g(x)\,dx     for any .  Discrete version  Wiener's theorem has a counterpart in : the span of the translations of is dense if and only if the Fourier transform       φ   (  θ  )    =    ∑   n  ∈  ℤ     f   (  n  )     e   -   i  n  θ              φ  θ     subscript     n  ℤ      f  n   superscript  e      i  n  θ         \varphi(\theta)=\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}f(n)e^{-in\theta}\,     has no real zeros. The following statements are equivalent version of this result:   Suppose the Fourier transform of has no real zeros, and the convolution    f  *  h      f  h    f*h   tends to zero at infinity for some bounded sequence   h   h   h   . Then    g  *  h      g  h    g*h   for any .    Let   φ   φ   φ   be a function on the unit circle with absolutely convergent Fourier series. Then    1  /  φ      1  φ    1/φ   has absolutely convergent Fourier series if and only if   φ   φ   φ   has no zeros.   showed that this is equivalent to the following property of the Wiener algebra     A   (  𝐓  )       A  𝐓    A(\mathbf{T})   , which he proved using the theory of Banach algebras, thereby giving a new proof of Wiener's result:   The maximal ideals of    A   (  𝐓  )       A  𝐓    A(\mathbf{T})   are all of the form            M  x   =   {   f  ∈   A   (  𝕋  )     ∣    f   (  x  )    =  0   }    ,   x  ∈  𝕋    .     formulae-sequence     subscript  M  x    conditional-set    f    A  𝕋        f  x   0       x  𝕋     M_{x}=\left\{f\in A(\mathbb{T})\,\mid\,f(x)=0\right\},\quad x\in\mathbb{T}.\,        The condition in  Let be a square-integrable function. The span of translations =    f   (   x  +  a   )       f    x  a     f(x+a)   is dense in if and only if the real zeros of the Fourier transform of   f   f   f   form a set of zero Lebesgue measure .  The parallel statement in is as follows: the span of translations of a sequence is dense if and only if the zero set of the Fourier transform       φ   (  θ  )    =    ∑   n  ∈  ℤ     f   (  n  )     e   -   i  n  θ              φ  θ     subscript     n  ℤ      f  n   superscript  e      i  n  θ         \varphi(\theta)=\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}f(n)e^{-in\theta}\,     has zero Lebesgue measure.
