   Omega constant      Omega constant   The omega constant is a mathematical constant defined by        Ω    e  Ω    =   1.         normal-Ω   superscript  e  normal-Ω    1.    \Omega\,e^{\Omega}=1.\,     It is the value of W (1) where W is Lambert's W function . The name is derived from the alternate name for Lambert's W function, the omega function .  The value of Ω is approximately 0.5671432904097838729999686622... . It has properties that        e   -  Ω    =  Ω   ,       superscript  e    normal-Ω    normal-Ω    e^{-\Omega}=\Omega,\,     or equivalently,        ln  Ω   =   -  Ω    .        normal-Ω     normal-Ω     \ln\Omega=-\Omega.\,     One can calculate Ω iteratively , by starting with an initial guess Ω 0 , and considering the sequence        Ω   n  +  1    =   e   -   Ω  n      .       subscript  normal-Ω    n  1     superscript  e     subscript  normal-Ω  n       \Omega_{n+1}=e^{-\Omega_{n}}.\,     This sequence will converge towards Ω as n →∞. This convergence is due to the fact that Ω is an attractive fixed point of the function e − x .  It is much more efficient to use the iteration        Ω   n  +  1    =    1  +   Ω  n     1  +   e   Ω  n       ,       subscript  normal-Ω    n  1        1   subscript  normal-Ω  n      1   superscript  e   subscript  normal-Ω  n        \Omega_{n+1}=\frac{1+\Omega_{n}}{1+e^{\Omega_{n}}},     because the function        f   (  x  )    =    1  +  x    1  +   e  x      ,        f  x       1  x     1   superscript  e  x       f(x)=\frac{1+x}{1+e^{x}},     has the same fixed point but features a zero derivative at this fixed point, therefore the convergence is quadratic (the number of correct digits is roughly doubled with each iteration).  A beautiful identity due to Victor Adamchik is given by the relationship      Ω  =    1     ∫   -  ∞    +  ∞         d   t      (    e  t   -  t   )   2   +   π  2        -  1.       normal-Ω      1    superscript   subscript                 d  t      superscript     superscript  e  t   t   2    superscript  π  2       1.     \Omega=\frac{1}{\displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{\,dt}{(e^{t}-t)^{2}%
 +\pi^{2}}}-1.     Irrationality and transcendence  Ω can be proven irrational from the fact that e is transcendental ; if Ω were rational, then there would exist integers p and q such that       p  q   =  Ω        p  q   normal-Ω    \frac{p}{q}=\Omega     so that      1  =    p   e   (   p  q   )     q       1      p   superscript  e    p  q     q     1=\frac{pe^{\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)}}{q}         e  =    (   q  p   )    (   q  p   )    =     q  q    p  q    p         e   superscript    q  p     q  p            p      superscript  q  q    superscript  p  q        e=\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)^{\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)}=\sqrt[p]{\frac{q^{q}}{p^%
 {q}}}     and e would therefore be algebraic of degree p . However e is transcendental, so Ω must be irrational.  Ω is in fact transcendental as the direct consequence of Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem . If Ω were algebraic, e -Ω would be transcendental; but Ω=exp(-Ω), so these cannot both be true.
