   Beta Cephei      Beta Cephei   Beta Cephei (β Cep, β Cephei) is a third magnitude star in the constellation  Cepheus . It has the traditional name Alfirk ( Arabic الفرقة al-firqah ), meaning "The Flock" (referring to a flock of sheep) This star, along with α Cep (Alderamin) and η Cep (Alkidr), were Al Kawākib al Firḳ ( الكوكب الفرق ), meaning "the Stars of The Flock" by Ulug Beg . 1 2 Beta Cephei is the prototype of the Beta Cephei variable stars.  Visibility  Like the star Epsilon Draconis in the constellation of Draco , Alfirk is visible primarily in the northern hemisphere , given its extreme northern declination of 70 degrees and 34 minutes. The star is nevertheless visible to most observers throughout the world reaching as far south as cities like Harare in Zimbabwe , Santa Cruz de la Sierra in Bolivia or other settlements north ± 19° South latitude. The star is circumpolar throughout all of Europe , northern Asia, and North American cities as far south as Guadalajara in west central Mexico . All other locations around the globe having a latitude greater than ± 20° North will notice that the star is always visible in the night sky. Because Beta Cephei is a faint third magnitude star, it may be difficult to identify in most light polluted cities, though in rural locations the star should be easily observable.  Properties  Beta Cephei is a triple star comprising a spectroscopic binary with a magnitude 8 optical companion. 3 Its magnitude varies between +3.15 and +3.21 with a period of 0.1904844 days.  Beta Cephei A is a blue giant star with a stellar classification listed in the SIMBAD astronomical database as B2IIIev. 4 The suffix "ev" comes from the Yerkes classification system and stands for "Spectral emission that exhibits variability" . This giant star has a radius that has been estimated at  and a mass of . Like most high mass B class stars, β Cep is a relatively young star with an estimated age of around 50 million years old. Like the majority of giant stars, Beta Cephei A rotates slowly on its axis with a rotational velocity of 7 deg/day, a speed which takes the star approximately 51 days to make one complete revolution.  In 2007, Floor van Leeuwen and his team recalibrated the star's apparent magnitude at 3.1438 and updated the star's parallax to 4.76 ± 0.30 mas yielding a distance of 210.1 parsecs (pc) or approximately 685 light years (ly) from Earth . 5 The previous estimate from the Hipparcos mission had placed the star at about 595 ly. Given a surface temperature of 26,700 Kelvin, theoretical calculations yield a total luminosity for the star of about . The formula for the bolometric luminosity of Beta Cephei is as follows:        L  A    L  ⊙    =     (    R  A    R  ⊙    )   2     (    T  A    T  ⊙    )   4           subscript  L  normal-A    subscript  L  direct-product       superscript     subscript  R  normal-A    subscript  R  direct-product    2    superscript     subscript  T  normal-A    subscript  T  direct-product    4      \frac{L_{\rm A}}{L_{\odot}}={\left(\frac{R_{\rm A}}{R_{\odot}}\right)}^{2}{%
 \left(\frac{T_{\rm A}}{T_{\odot}}\right)}^{4}   where... A = Alfirk, L = Luminosity, R = Radius and T = Temperature. Therefore:         L  A    L  ⊙    =     (   9  1   )   2     (    26  ,  700    5  ,  778    )   4    =  36   ,   933   L  ⊙       formulae-sequence         subscript  L  normal-A    subscript  L  direct-product       superscript    9  1   2    superscript     26  700    5  778    4         36      933   subscript  L  direct-product      \frac{L_{\rm A}}{L_{\odot}}={\left({\frac{9}{1}}\right)}^{2}{\left({\frac{26,7%
 00}{5,778}}\right)}^{4}=36,933L_{\odot}     Note: Luminosity calculations are highly dependent on size and distance variables.
