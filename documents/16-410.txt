Michael Shub

Michael Ira Shub (born August 17, 1943) is an American mathematician who has done research into Dynamical Systems and the Complexity of Real Number Algorithms.
Biography
Shub obtained his Ph.D. degree at the University of California, Berkeley with a thesis entitled Endomorphisms of Compact Differentiable Manifolds on 1967. His advisor was Stephen Smale.1 From 1967 to 1985 he worked at Brandeis University, the University of California (Santa Cruz) and the Queens College at the City University of New York. From 1985 to 2004 he joined IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center. From 2004 to 2010 he worked at the University of Toronto. After 2010 he is a researcher at the University of Buenos Aires and at the City University of New York.
Shub was the Chair of the  Society for the Foundations of Computational Mathematics from 1995 to 1997. In 2012, a conference From Dynamics to Complexity was organised at the Fields Institute in Toronto celebrating his work.2
Work
Shub has produced publications in dynamical systems and in the complexity of real number algorithms. In his Ph.D. in 1967 he introduced the notion of expanding maps, which gave the first examples of structurally stable strange attractors. In 1974 he proposed the Entropy Conjecture, an important open problem in Dynamical Systems, which was proved by Yosef Yomdin for 
 
 
 
  mappings in 1987.3 This same year Michael Shub published his book Global Stability of Dynamical Systems, which is often used as a reference in introductory and advances books on the subject of Dynamical Systems.456 He described jointly with Lenore and Manuel Blum a simple, unpredictable, secure random number generator. see Blum Blum Shub. This is said to be useful from theoretical and practical perspectives. See.7 In 1989 he proposed with Lenore Blum and Stephen Smale the notion of Blum–Shub–Smale machine, an alternative to the classical Turing model of computation. Their model is used to analyse the computability of functions.8 In 1993, Shub and Smale initiated a rigorous analysis of homotopy-based algorithms for solving systems of nonlinear algebraic equations which has inspired much of the work in that area during the last two decades.9 Shub was one of the founders of the nonprofit association Foundations of Computational Mathematics, and editor of their journal Foundations of Computational Mathematics with the same name until 2009.
