Cis-zeatin O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase




Cis-zeatin O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, a cis-zeatin O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + cis-zeatin 
 
 
 
  UDP + O-beta-D-glucosyl-cis-zeatin
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and cis-zeatin, whereas its two products are UDP and O-beta-D-glucosyl-cis-zeatin.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:cis-zeatin O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase.
