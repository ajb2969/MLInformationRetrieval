   Precorrin-6A reductase      Precorrin-6A reductase   In enzymology , a precorrin-6A reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   precorrin-6B + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   precorrin-6A + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are precorrin 6B and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are precorrin 6A , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is precorrin-6B:NADP+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include precorrin-6X reductase , and precorrin-6Y:NADP+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.  References      "  Category:EC 1.3.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
