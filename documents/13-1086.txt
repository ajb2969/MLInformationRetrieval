   Quantum differential calculus      Quantum differential calculus   In quantum geometry or noncommutative geometry a quantum differential calculus or noncommutative differential structure on an algebra   A   A   A   over a field   k   k   k   means the specification of a space of differential forms over the algebra. The algebra   A   A   A   here is regarded as a coordinate ring but it is important that it may be noncommutative and hence not an actual algebra of coordinate functions on any actual space, so this represents a point of view replacing the specification for an actual space of a differentiable structure. In ordinary differential geometry one can multiply differential 1-forms by functions form the left and the right and has an exterior derivative. Correspondingly, a first order quantum differential calculus means at least the following:  1. An   A   A   A   -   A   A   A   -bimodule    Ω  1     superscript  normal-Ω  1    \Omega^{1}   over   A   A   A   , i.e. one can multiply elements of    Ω  1     superscript  normal-Ω  1    \Omega^{1}   by elements of   A   A   A   in an associative way:        a   (   ω  b   )    =     (   a  ω   )   b   ,   ∀  a     ,    b  ∈  A   ,   ω  ∈   Ω  1        formulae-sequence      a    ω  b         a  ω   b    for-all  a      formulae-sequence    b  A     ω   superscript  normal-Ω  1       a(\omega b)=(a\omega)b,\ \forall a,b\in A,\ \omega\in\Omega^{1}   .  2. A linear map    d  :   A  →   Ω  1       normal-:  normal-d   normal-→  A   superscript  normal-Ω  1      {\rm d}:A\to\Omega^{1}   obeying the Leibniz rule        d   (   a  b   )    =     a   (   d  b   )    +    (   d  a   )   b    ,   ∀  a     ,   b  ∈  A      formulae-sequence      normal-d    a  b         a    normal-d  b        normal-d  a   b     for-all  a       b  A     {\rm d}(ab)=a({\rm d}b)+({\rm d}a)b,\ \forall a,b\in A     3.     Ω  1   =   {   a   (   d  b   )    |    a  ,  b   ∈  A   }        superscript  normal-Ω  1    conditional-set    a    normal-d  b       a  b   A      \Omega^{1}=\{a({\rm d}b)\ |\ a,b\in A\}     4. (optional connectedness condition)      ker   d   =   k  1        kernel  normal-d     k  1     \ker\ {\rm d}=k1     The last condition is not always imposed but holds in ordinary geometry when the manifold is connected. It says that the only functions killed by   d   normal-d   {\rm d}   are constant functions.  An exterior algebra or differential graded algebra structure over   A   A   A   means a compatible extension of    Ω  1     superscript  normal-Ω  1    \Omega^{1}   to include analogues of higher order differential forms       Ω  =     ⊕  n    Ω  n    ,  d    :    Ω  n   →   Ω   n  +  1        normal-:    normal-Ω     subscript  direct-sum  n    superscript  normal-Ω  n    normal-d     normal-→   superscript  normal-Ω  n    superscript  normal-Ω    n  1       \Omega=\oplus_{n}\Omega^{n},\ {\rm d}:\Omega^{n}\to\Omega^{n+1}     obeying a graded-Leibniz rule with respect to an associative product on   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   and obeying     d  2   =  0       superscript  normal-d  2   0    {\rm d}^{2}=0   . Here     Ω  0   =  A       superscript  normal-Ω  0   A    \Omega^{0}=A   and it is usually required that   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is generated by    A  ,   Ω  1      A   superscript  normal-Ω  1     A,\Omega^{1}   . The product of differential forms is called the exterior or wedge product and often denoted   ∧     \wedge   . The noncommutative or quantum de Rham cohomology is defined as the cohomology of this complex.  A higher order differential calculus can mean an exterior algebra or it can mean the partial specification of one up to some highest degree and with products that would result in a degree beyond the highest being unspecified.  The above definition lies at the crossroads of two approaches to noncommutative geometry. In the Connes approach a more fundamental object is a replacement for the Dirac operator in the form of a spectral triple , and an exterior algebra can be constructed from this data. In the quantum groups approach to noncommutative geometry one starts with the algebra and a choice of first order calculus but constrained by covariance under a quantum group symmetry.  Note  The above definition is minimal and gives something more general than classical differential calculus even when the algebra   A   A   A   is commutative or functions on an actual space. This is because we do not demand that        a   (   d  b   )    =     (  db  )   a   ,   ∀  a     ,   b  ∈  A      formulae-sequence      a    normal-d  b       db  a    for-all  a       b  A     a({\rm d}b)=({\rm db})a,\ \forall a,b\in A     since this would imply that      d   (    a  b   -   b  a    )    =   0  ,   ∀  a     ,   b  ∈  A      formulae-sequence      normal-d      a  b     b  a      0   for-all  a       b  A     {\rm d}(ab-ba)=0,\ \forall a,b\in A   , which would violate axiom 4 when the algebra was noncommutative. As a byproduct, this enlarged definition includes finite difference calculi and quantum differential calculi on finite sets and finite groups (finite group Lie algebra theory).  Examples  1. For    A  =   ℂ   [  x  ]        A    ℂ   delimited-[]  x      A={\mathbb{C}}[x]   the algebra of polynomials in one variable the translation-covariant quantum differential calculi are parametrized by    λ  ∈  ℂ      λ  ℂ    \lambda\in\mathbb{C}   and take the form        Ω  1   =  ℂ   .     d  x   ,    (   d  x   )   f   (  x  )     =   f   (   x  +  λ   )    (   d  x   )     ,    d  f   =      f   (   x  +  λ   )    -   f   (  x  )     λ   d  x       formulae-sequence     superscript  normal-Ω  1   ℂ        normal-d  x       normal-d  x   f  x      f    x  λ     normal-d  x         normal-d  f           f    x  λ      f  x    λ   normal-d  x      \Omega^{1}={\mathbb{C}}.{\rm d}x,\quad({\rm d}x)f(x)=f(x+\lambda)({\rm d}x),%
 \quad{\rm d}f={f(x+\lambda)-f(x)\over\lambda}{\rm d}x     This shows how finite differences arise naturally in quantum geometry. Only the limit    λ  →  0     normal-→  λ  0    \lambda\to 0   has functions commuting with 1-forms, which is the special case of high school differential calculus.  2. For    A  =   ℂ   [  t  ,   t   -  1    ]        A    ℂ   t   superscript  t    1        A={\mathbb{C}}[t,t^{-1}]   the algebra of functions on an algebraic circle, the translation (i.e. circle-rotation)-covariant differential calculi are parametrized by    q  ≠  0  ∈  ℂ        q  0       ℂ     q\neq 0\in\mathbb{C}   and take the form        Ω  1   =  ℂ   .     d  t   ,    (   d  t   )   f   (  t  )     =   f   (   q  t   )    (   d  t   )     ,    d  f   =       f   (   q  t   )    -   f   (  t  )      q   (   t  -  1   )      dt       formulae-sequence     superscript  normal-Ω  1   ℂ        normal-d  t       normal-d  t   f  t      f    q  t     normal-d  t         normal-d  f           f    q  t      f  t      q    t  1     dt      \Omega^{1}={\mathbb{C}}.{\rm d}t,\quad({\rm d}t)f(t)=f(qt)({\rm d}t),\quad{\rm
 d%
 }f={f(qt)-f(t)\over q(t-1)}\,{\rm dt}     This shows how   q   q   q   -differentials arise naturally in quantum geometry.  3. For any algebra   A   A   A   one has a universal differential calculus defined by        Ω  1   =   ker   (   m  :    A  ⊗  A   →  A    )     ,     d  a   =    1  ⊗  a   -   a  ⊗  1     ,    ∀  a   ∈  A       formulae-sequence     superscript  normal-Ω  1    kernel   normal-:  m   normal-→   tensor-product  A  A   A       formulae-sequence      normal-d  a      tensor-product  1  a    tensor-product  a  1        for-all  a   A      \Omega^{1}=\ker(m:A\otimes A\to A),\quad{\rm d}a=1\otimes a-a\otimes 1,\quad%
 \forall a\in A     where   m   m   m   is the algebra product. By axiom 3., any first order calculus is a quotient of this.
