Four 5-cubes meet at each cubic cell, and it is more explicitly called an order-4 penteractic honeycomb.
It is analogous to the square tiling of the plane and to the cubic honeycomb of 3-space, and the tesseractic honeycomb of 4-space.
Constructions
There are many different Wythoff constructions of this honeycomb. The most symmetric form is regular, with Schläfli symbol {4,33,4}. Another form has two alternating 5-cube facets (like a checkerboard) with Schläfli symbol {4,3,3,31,1}. The lowest symmetry Wythoff construction has 32 types of facets around each vertex and a prismatic product Schläfli symbol {∞}5.
Related polytopes and honeycombs
The [4,33,4], , Coxeter group generates 63 permutations of uniform tessellations, 35 with unique symmetry and 34 with unique geometry. The expanded 5-cubic honeycomb is geometrically identical to the 5-cubic honeycomb.
The 5-cubic honeycomb can be alternated into the 5-demicubic honeycomb, replacing the 5-cubes with 5-demicubes, and the alternated gaps are filled by 5-orthoplex facets.
It is also related to the regular 6-cube which exists in 6-space with 3 5-cubes on each cell. This could be considered as a tessellation on the 5-sphere, an order-3 penteractic honeycomb, {4,34}.
Tritruncated 5-cubic honeycomb
