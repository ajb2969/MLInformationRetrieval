   Phosphoglucokinase      Phosphoglucokinase   In enzymology , a phosphoglucokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + alpha-D-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate , whereas its two products are ADP and alpha-D-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate 6-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include glucose-phosphate kinase , phosphoglucokinase (phosphorylating) , and ATP:D-glucose-1-phosphate 6-phosphotransferase . This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
