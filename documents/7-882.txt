Multiple (mathematics)

In mathematics, a multiple is the product of any quantity and an integer.123 In other words, for the quantities a and b, we say that b is a multiple of a if b = na for some integer n, which is called the multiplier or coefficient. If a is not zero, this is equivalent to saying that b/a is an integer with no remainder.456 If a and b are both integers, and b is a multiple of a, then a is called a divisor of b.
Examples
14, 49, -21 and 0 are multiples of 7, whereas 3 and -6 are not. This is because there are integers that 7 may be multiplied by to reach the values of 14, 49, 0 and -21, while there are no such integers for 3 and -6. Each of the products listed below, and in particular, the products for 3 and -6, is the only way that the relevant number can be written as a product of 7 and another real number:















 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a rational number, not an integer


 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a rational number, not an integer.

Properties

0 is a multiple of everything (
 
 
 
 ).
The product of any integer 
 
 
 
  and any integer is a multiple of 
 
 
 
 . In particular, 
 
 
 
 , which is equal to 
 
 
 
 , is a multiple of 
 
 
 
  (every integer is a multiple of itself), since 1 is an integer.
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are multiples of 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are also multiples of 
 
 
 
 .
