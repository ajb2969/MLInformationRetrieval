   Multiple (mathematics)      Multiple (mathematics)   In mathematics , a multiple is the product of any quantity and an integer . 1 2 3 In other words, for the quantities a and b , we say that b is a multiple of a if b = na for some integer n , which is called the multiplier or coefficient . If a is not zero , this is equivalent to saying that b / a is an integer with no remainder . 4 5 6 If a and b are both integers, and b is a multiple of a , then a is called a divisor of b .  Examples  14, 49, -21 and 0 are multiples of 7, whereas 3 and -6 are not. This is because there are integers that 7 may be multiplied by to reach the values of 14, 49, 0 and -21, while there are no such integers for 3 and -6. Each of the products listed below, and in particular, the products for 3 and -6, is the only way that the relevant number can be written as a product of 7 and another real number:       14  =   7  ×  2       14    7  2     14=7\times 2         49  =   7  ×  7       49    7  7     49=7\times 7          -  21   =   7  ×   (   -  3   )          21     7    3      -21=7\times(-3)         0  =   7  ×  0       0    7  0     0=7\times 0         3  =   7  ×   (   3  /  7   )        3    7    3  7      3=7\times(3/7)   ,    3  /  7      3  7    3/7   is a rational number, not an integer       -  6   =   7  ×   (   -   6  /  7    )          6     7      6  7       -6=7\times(-6/7)   ,    -   6  /  7         6  7     -6/7   is a rational number, not an integer.   Properties   0 is a multiple of everything (    0  =   0  ⋅  b       0   normal-⋅  0  b     0=0\cdot b   ).  The product of any integer   n   n   n   and any integer is a multiple of   n   n   n   . In particular,   n   n   n   , which is equal to    n  ×  1      n  1    n\times 1   , is a multiple of   n   n   n   (every integer is a multiple of itself), since 1 is an integer.  If   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   are multiples of   x   x   x   then    a  +  b      a  b    a+b   and    a  -  b      a  b    a-b   are also multiples of   x   x   x   .
