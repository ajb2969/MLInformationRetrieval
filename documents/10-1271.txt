   Benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+)      Benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+)   In enzymology , a benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   benzaldehyde + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   benzoate + NADH + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are benzaldehyde , NAD + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are benzoate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is benzaldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include benzaldehyde (NAD+) dehydrogenase , and benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+) . This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation and toluene and xylene degradation .
