   Root system      Root system   In mathematics , a root system is a configuration of vectors in a Euclidean space satisfying certain geometrical properties. The concept is fundamental in the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras . Since Lie groups (and some analogues such as algebraic groups ) and Lie algebras have become important in many parts of mathematics during the twentieth century, the apparently special nature of root systems belies the number of areas in which they are applied. Further, the classification scheme for root systems, by Dynkin diagrams , occurs in parts of mathematics with no overt connection to Lie theory (such as singularity theory ). Finally, root systems are important for their own sake, as in Spectral graph theory . 1  Definitions and first examples  As a first example, consider the six vectors in 2-dimensional Euclidean space , R 2 , as shown in the image at the right; call them roots . These vectors span the whole space. If you consider the line perpendicular to any root, say Œ≤, then the reflection of R 2 in that line sends any other root, say Œ±, to another root. Moreover, the root to which it is sent equals Œ±+ n Œ≤ , where n is an integer (in this case, n equals 1). These six vectors satisfy the following definition, and therefore they form a root system; this one is known as A 2 .  Definition  Let V be a finite-dimensional Euclidean  vector space , with the standard Euclidean inner product denoted by    (  ‚ãÖ  ,  ‚ãÖ  )     normal-‚ãÖ  normal-‚ãÖ    (\cdot,\cdot)   . A root system in V is a finite set Œ¶ of non-zero vectors (called roots ) that satisfy the following conditions: 2 3 An equivalent way of writing conditions 3 and 4 is as follows:  Some authors only include conditions 1‚Äì3 in the definition of a root system. 4 In this context, a root system that also satisfies the integrality condition is known as a crystallographic root system . 5 Other authors omit condition 2; then they call root systems satisfying condition 2 reduced . 6 In this article, all root systems are assumed to be reduced and crystallographic.  In view of property 3, the integrality condition is equivalent to stating that Œ≤ and its reflection œÉ Œ± ( Œ≤ ) differ by an integer multiple of Œ± . Note that the operator       ‚ü®  ‚ãÖ  ,  ‚ãÖ  ‚ü©   :    Œ¶  √ó  Œ¶   ‚Üí  ‚Ñ§      normal-:   normal-‚ãÖ  normal-‚ãÖ    normal-‚Üí    normal-Œ¶  normal-Œ¶   ‚Ñ§     \langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle\colon\Phi\times\Phi\to\mathbb{Z}     defined by property 4 is not an inner product. It is not necessarily symmetric and is linear only in the first argument.      Rank-2 root systems    (Figure)  Root system A 1 + A 1      Root system     A  1   √ó   A  1        subscript  A  1    subscript  A  1     A_{1}\times A_{1}        (Figure)  Root system A 2      Root system    A  2     subscript  A  2    A_{2}        (Figure)  Root system B 2      Root system    B  2     subscript  B  2    B_{2}         The rank of a root system Œ¶ is the dimension of V . Two root systems may be combined by regarding the Euclidean spaces they span as mutually orthogonal subspaces of a common Euclidean space. A root system which does not arise from such a combination, such as the systems A 2 , B 2 , and G 2 pictured to the right, is said to be irreducible .  Two root systems ( E 1 ,¬†Œ¶ 1 ) and ( E 2 ,¬†Œ¶ 2 ) are called isomorphic if there is an invertible linear transformation E 1 ‚Üí E 2 which sends¬†Œ¶ 1 to¬†Œ¶ 2 such that for each pair of roots, the number    ‚ü®  x  ,  y  ‚ü©     x  y    \langle x,y\rangle   is preserved. 7  The group of isometries of V generated by reflections through hyperplanes associated to the roots of¬†Œ¶ is called the Weyl group of¬†Œ¶. As it acts faithfully on the finite set¬†Œ¶, the Weyl group is always finite.  The of a root system Œ¶ is the Z -submodule of V generated by¬†Œ¶. It is a lattice in V .  Rank two examples  There is only one root system of rank 1, consisting of two nonzero vectors    {  Œ±  ,   -  Œ±   }     Œ±    Œ±     \{\alpha,-\alpha\}   . This root system is called    A  1     subscript  A  1    A_{1}   .  In rank 2 there are four possibilities, corresponding to      œÉ  Œ±    (  Œ≤  )    =   Œ≤  +   n  Œ±           subscript  œÉ  Œ±   Œ≤     Œ≤    n  Œ±      \sigma_{\alpha}(\beta)=\beta+n\alpha   , where    n  =   0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  3       n   0  1  2  3     n=0,1,2,3   . Note that a root system that generates a lattice is not unique     A  1   √ó   A  1        subscript  A  1    subscript  A  1     A_{1}\times A_{1}   and    B  2     subscript  B  2    B_{2}   generate a square lattice while    A  2     subscript  A  2    A_{2}   and    G  2     subscript  G  2    G_{2}   generate a hexagonal lattice , only two of the five possible types of lattices in two dimensions .  Whenever Œ¶ is a root system in V , and U is a subspace of V spanned by Œ®¬†=¬†Œ¶¬†‚à© U , then¬†Œ® is a root system in U . Thus, the exhaustive list of four root systems of rank¬†2 shows the geometric possibilities for any two roots chosen from a root system of arbitrary rank. In particular, two such roots must meet at an angle of 0, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 135, 150, or 180 degrees.  History  The concept of a root system was originally introduced by Wilhelm Killing around 1889 (in German, Wurzelsystem 8 ). 9 He used them in his attempt to classify all simple Lie algebras over the field of complex numbers . Killing originally made a mistake in the classification, listing two exceptional rank 4 root systems, when in fact there is only one, now known as F 4 . Cartan later corrected this mistake, by showing Killing's two root systems were isomorphic. 10  Killing investigated the structure of a Lie algebra   L   L   L   , by considering (what is now called) a Cartan subalgebra    ùî•   ùî•   \mathfrak{h}   . Then he studied the roots of the characteristic polynomial     det   (     ad  L   x   -  t   )            subscript  ad  L   x   t     \det(\mathrm{ad}_{L}x-t)   , where    x  ‚àà  ùî•      x  ùî•    x\in\mathfrak{h}   . Here a root is considered as a function of   ùî•   ùî•   \mathfrak{h}   , or indeed as an element of the dual vector space    ùî•  *     superscript  ùî•     \mathfrak{h}^{*}   . This set of roots form a root system inside    ùî•  *     superscript  ùî•     \mathfrak{h}^{*}   , as defined above, where the inner product is the Killing form . 11  Elementary consequences of the root system axioms  (Figure)  The integrality condition for  is fulfilled only for Œ≤ on one of the vertical lines, while the integrality condition for  is fulfilled only for Œ≤ on one of the red circles. Any Œ≤ perpendicular to Œ± (on the Y axis) trivially fulfills both with 0, but does not define an irreducible root system. Modulo reflection, for a given Œ± there are only 5 nontrivial possibilities for Œ≤, and 3 possible angles between Œ± and Œ≤ in a set of simple roots. Subscript letters correspond to the series of root systems for which the given Œ≤ can serve as the first root and Œ± as the second root. (or in F 4 as the middle 2 roots)   The cosine of the angle between two roots is constrained to be a half-integral multiple of a square root of an integer. This is because    ‚ü®  Œ≤  ,  Œ±  ‚ü©     Œ≤  Œ±    \langle\beta,\alpha\rangle   and    ‚ü®  Œ±  ,  Œ≤  ‚ü©     Œ±  Œ≤    \langle\alpha,\beta\rangle   are both integers, by assumption, and         ‚ü®  Œ≤  ,  Œ±  ‚ü©    ‚ü®  Œ±  ,  Œ≤  ‚ü©    =     2    (  Œ±  ,  Œ≤  )    (  Œ±  ,  Œ±  )     ‚ãÖ  2     (  Œ±  ,  Œ≤  )    (  Œ≤  ,  Œ≤  )     =   4     (  Œ±  ,  Œ≤  )   2      |  Œ±  |   2     |  Œ≤  |   2      =   4    cos  2    (  Œ∏  )     =    (   2   cos   (  Œ∏  )     )   2   ‚àà  ‚Ñ§   .

 \mathbb{Z}.     Since     2   cos   (  Œ∏  )     ‚àà   [   -  2   ,  2  ]         2    Œ∏       2   2     2\cos(\theta)\in[-2,2]   , the only possible values for    cos   (  Œ∏  )       Œ∏    \cos(\theta)   are     0  ,   ¬±   1  2    ,   ¬±    2   2    ,   ¬±    3   2    ,   ¬±    4   2     =   ¬±  1        0   plus-or-minus    1  2     plus-or-minus      2   2     plus-or-minus      3   2     plus-or-minus      4   2      plus-or-minus  1     0,\pm\tfrac{1}{2},\pm\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\pm\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\pm\tfrac{%
 \sqrt{4}}{2}=\pm 1   , corresponding to angles of 90¬∞, 60¬∞ or 120¬∞, 45¬∞ or 135¬∞, 30¬∞ or 150¬∞, and 0 or 180¬∞. Condition 2 says that no scalar multiples of Œ± other than 1 and -1 can be roots, so 0 or 180¬∞, which would correspond to 2 Œ± or ‚àí2 Œ± , are out.  Positive roots and simple roots  Given a root system Œ¶ we can always choose (in many ways) a set of positive roots . This is a subset    Œ¶  +     superscript  normal-Œ¶     \Phi^{+}   of Œ¶ such that   For each root    Œ±  ‚àà  Œ¶      Œ±  normal-Œ¶    \alpha\in\Phi   exactly one of the roots   Œ±   Œ±   \alpha   , ‚Äì   Œ±   Œ±   \alpha   is contained in    Œ¶  +     superscript  normal-Œ¶     \Phi^{+}   .  For any two distinct     Œ±  ,  Œ≤   ‚àà   Œ¶  +        Œ±  Œ≤    superscript  normal-Œ¶      \alpha,\beta\in\Phi^{+}   such that    Œ±  +  Œ≤      Œ±  Œ≤    \alpha+\beta   is a root,     Œ±  +  Œ≤   ‚àà   Œ¶  +         Œ±  Œ≤    superscript  normal-Œ¶      \alpha+\beta\in\Phi^{+}   .   If a set of positive roots    Œ¶  +     superscript  normal-Œ¶     \Phi^{+}   is chosen, elements of    -   Œ¶  +        superscript  normal-Œ¶      -\Phi^{+}   are called negative roots .  An element of    Œ¶  +     superscript  normal-Œ¶     \Phi^{+}   is called a simple root if it cannot be written as the sum of two elements of    Œ¶  +     superscript  normal-Œ¶     \Phi^{+}   . The set   Œî   normal-Œî   \Delta   of simple roots is a basis of   V   V   V   with the property that every vector in   Œ¶   normal-Œ¶   \Phi   is a linear combination of elements of   Œî   normal-Œî   \Delta   with all coefficients non-negative, or all coefficients non-positive. For each choice of positive roots, the corresponding set of simple roots is the unique set of roots such that the positive roots are exactly those that can be expressed as a combination of them with non-negative coefficients, and such that these combinations are unique.  The root poset  The set of positive roots is naturally ordered by saying that    Œ±  ‚â§  Œ≤      Œ±  Œ≤    \alpha\leq\beta   if and only if    Œ≤  -  Œ±      Œ≤  Œ±    \beta-\alpha   is a nonnegative linear combination of simple roots. This poset is graded by     deg   (    ‚àë   Œ±  ‚àà  Œî      Œª  Œ±   Œ±    )    =    ‚àë   Œ±  ‚àà  Œî     Œª  Œ±         deg    subscript     Œ±  normal-Œî       subscript  Œª  Œ±   Œ±       subscript     Œ±  normal-Œî     subscript  Œª  Œ±      \operatorname{deg}\big(\sum_{\alpha\in\Delta}\lambda_{\alpha}\alpha\big)=\sum_%
 {\alpha\in\Delta}\lambda_{\alpha}   , and has many remarkable combinatorial properties, one of them being that one can determine the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the corresponding Weyl group from this poset. 12 The Hasse graph is a visualization of the ordering of the root poset.  Dual root system and coroots  If Œ¶ is a root system in V , the coroot Œ± V of a root Œ± is defined by        Œ±  ‚à®   =     2   (  Œ±  ,  Œ±  )     Œ±    .       superscript  Œ±        2   Œ±  Œ±    Œ±     \alpha^{\vee}={2\over(\alpha,\alpha)}\,\alpha.     The set of coroots also forms a root system Œ¶ V in V , called the dual root system (or sometimes inverse root system ). By definition, Œ± V V = Œ±, so that Œ¶ is the dual root system of Œ¶ V . The lattice in V spanned by Œ¶ V is called the coroot lattice . Both Œ¶ and Œ¶ V have the same Weyl group W and, for s in W ,         (   s  Œ±   )   ‚à®   =   s   (   Œ±  ‚à®   )     .       superscript    s  Œ±       s   superscript  Œ±       (s\alpha)^{\vee}=s(\alpha^{\vee}).     If Œî is a set of simple roots for Œ¶, then Œî V is a set of simple roots for Œ¶ V .  Classification of root systems by Dynkin diagrams  (Figure)  Pictures of all the irreducible Dynkin diagrams   A root system is irreducible if it can not be partitioned into the union of two proper subsets    Œ¶  =    Œ¶  1   ‚à™   Œ¶  2        normal-Œ¶     subscript  normal-Œ¶  1    subscript  normal-Œ¶  2      \Phi=\Phi_{1}\cup\Phi_{2}   , such that     (  Œ±  ,  Œ≤  )   =  0       Œ±  Œ≤   0    (\alpha,\beta)=0   for all    Œ±  ‚àà   Œ¶  1       Œ±   subscript  normal-Œ¶  1     \alpha\in\Phi_{1}   and    Œ≤  ‚àà   Œ¶  2       Œ≤   subscript  normal-Œ¶  2     \beta\in\Phi_{2}   .  Irreducible root systems correspond to certain graphs , the Dynkin diagrams named after Eugene Dynkin . The classification of these graphs is a simple matter of combinatorics , and induces a classification of irreducible root systems.  Given a root system, select a set Œî of simple roots as in the preceding section. The vertices of the associated Dynkin diagram correspond to vectors in Œî. An edge is drawn between each non-orthogonal pair of vectors; it is an undirected single edge if they make an angle of     2  œÄ   /  3        2  œÄ   3    2\pi/3   radians, a directed double edge if they make an angle of     3  œÄ   /  4        3  œÄ   4    3\pi/4   radians, and a directed triple edge if they make an angle of     5  œÄ   /  6        5  œÄ   6    5\pi/6   radians. The term "directed edge" means that double and triple edges are marked with an angle sign pointing toward the shorter vector.  Although a given root system has more than one possible set of simple roots, the Weyl group acts transitively on such choices. Consequently, the Dynkin diagram is independent of the choice of simple roots; it is determined by the root system itself. Conversely, given two root systems with the same Dynkin diagram, one can match up roots, starting with the roots in the base, and show that the systems are in fact the same.  Thus the problem of classifying root systems reduces to the problem of classifying possible Dynkin diagrams. Root systems are irreducible if and only if their Dynkin diagrams are connected. Dynkin diagrams encode the inner product on E in terms of the basis Œî, and the condition that this inner product must be positive definite turns out to be all that is needed to get the desired classification.  The actual connected diagrams are as follows. The subscripts indicate the number of vertices in the diagram (and hence the rank of the corresponding irreducible root system).  Properties of the irreducible root systems         Œ¶   normal-Œ¶   \Phi          |  Œ¶  |      normal-Œ¶    |\Phi|          |   Œ¶  <   |       superscript  normal-Œ¶      |\Phi^{<}|      I   D       |  W  |      W    |W|          A n ( n ‚â•¬†1)   n ( n +¬†1)         n +¬†1   ( n +¬†1)!

There are four infinite families (A n , B n , C n , and D n , called the classical root systems ) and five exceptional cases (the exceptional root systems ). 13 The subscript indicates the rank of the root system.  In an irreducible root system there can be at most two values for the length ( Œ± , Œ± ) 1/2 , corresponding to short and long roots. If all roots have the same length they are taken to be long by definition and the root system is said to be simply laced ; this occurs in the cases A, D and E. Any two roots of the same length lie in the same orbit of the Weyl group. In the non-simply laced cases B, C, G and F, the root lattice is spanned by the short roots and the long roots span a sublattice, invariant under the Weyl group, equal to r 2 /2 times the coroot lattice, where r is the length of a long root.  In the table to the right, |Œ¶ | denotes the number of short roots, I denotes the index in the root lattice of the sublattice generated by long roots, D denotes the determinant of the Cartan matrix , and | W | denotes the order of the Weyl group .  Explicit construction of the irreducible root systems  A n      A 3        Œ± 1     Œ± 2     Œ± 3        Let V be the subspace of R n +1 for which the coordinates sum to 0, and let Œ¶ be the set of vectors in V of length ‚àö2 and which are integer vectors, i.e. have integer coordinates in R n +1 . Such a vector must have all but two coordinates equal to 0, one coordinate equal to 1, and one equal to ‚Äì1, so there are n 2 + n roots in all. One choice of simple roots expressed in the standard basis is: Œ± i = e i ‚Äì e i+1 , for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ n.  The reflection  œÉ i through the hyperplane perpendicular to Œ± i is the same as permutation of the adjacent i -th and ( i +¬†1 )-th coordinates . Such transpositions generate the full permutation group . For adjacent simple roots, œÉ i ( Œ± i +1 ) = Œ± i +1 + Œ± i = œÉ i +1 ( Œ± i ) = Œ± i + Œ± i +1 , that is, reflection is equivalent to adding a multiple of¬†1; but reflection of a simple root perpendicular to a nonadjacent simple root leaves it unchanged, differing by a multiple of¬†0.  The A n root lattice - that is, the lattice generated by the A n roots - is most easily described as the set of integer vectors in R n +1 whose components sum to zero.  The A 3 root lattice is known to crystallographers as the face-centered cubic ( fcc ) (or cubic close packed ) lattice. 14  B n      B 4     1     0     0     0        Let V = R n , and let Œ¶ consist of all integer vectors in V of length 1 or ‚àö2. The total number of roots is 2 n 2 . One choice of simple roots is: Œ± i = e i ‚Äì e i+1 , for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ n ‚Äì 1 (the above choice of simple roots for A n-1 ), and the shorter root Œ± n = e n .  The reflection œÉ n through the hyperplane perpendicular to the short root Œ± n is of course simply negation of the n th coordinate. For the long simple root Œ± n-1 , œÉ n-1 ( Œ± n ) = Œ± n + Œ± n-1 , but for reflection perpendicular to the short root, œÉ n ( Œ± n-1 ) = Œ± n-1 + 2 Œ± n , a difference by a multiple of 2 instead of 1.  The B n root lattice - that is, the lattice generated by the B n roots - consists of all integer vectors.  B 1 is isomorphic to A 1 via scaling by ‚àö2, and is therefore not a distinct root system.  C n      C 4     1     0     0     0        Let V = R n , and let Œ¶ consist of all integer vectors in V of length ‚àö2 together with all vectors of the form 2Œª, where Œª is an integer vector of length 1. The total number of roots is 2 n 2 . One choice of simple roots is: Œ± i = e i ‚Äì e i+1 , for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ n ‚Äì 1 (the above choice of simple roots for A n-1 ), and the longer root Œ± n = 2 e n . The reflection œÉ n ( Œ± n-1 ) = Œ± n-1 + Œ± n , but œÉ n-1 ( Œ± n ) = Œ± n + 2 Œ± n-1 .  The C n root lattice - that is, the lattice generated by the C n roots - consists of all integer vectors whose components sum to an even integer.  C 2 is isomorphic to B 2 via scaling by ‚àö2 and a 45 degree rotation, and is therefore not a distinct root system.  Root system B 3 , C 3 , and A 3 =D 3 as points within a cube and octahedron  D n      D 4     1     0     0     0    (Figure)  DynkinD4 labeled.png      Let V = R n , and let Œ¶ consist of all integer vectors in V of length ‚àö2. The total number of roots is 2 n ( n ‚Äì 1). One choice of simple roots is: Œ± i = e i ‚Äì e i+1 , for 1 ‚â§ i n-1''') plus Œ± n = e n + e n-1 .  Reflection through the hyperplane perpendicular to Œ± n is the same as transposing and negating the adjacent n -th and ( n ‚Äì 1 )-th coordinates. Any simple root and its reflection perpendicular to another simple root differ by a multiple of 0 or 1 of the second root, not by any greater multiple.  The D n root lattice - that is, the lattice generated by the D n roots - consists of all integer vectors whose components sum to an even integer. This is the same as the C n root lattice.  D 3 reduces to A 3 , and is therefore not a distinct root system.  D 4 has additional symmetry called triality .  E 6 , E 7 , E 8      72 vertices of 1 22 represent the root vectors of E 6 (Green nodes are doubled in this E6 Coxeter plane projection)   126 vertices of 2 31 represent the root vectors of E 7   240 vertices of 4 21 represent the root vectors of E 8    (Figure)  DynkinE6AltOrder.svg   (Figure)  DynkinE7AltOrder.svg   (Figure)  DynkinE8AltOrder.svg       The E 8 root system is any set of vectors in R 8 that is congruent to the following set:    D 8 ‚à™ { ¬Ω( ‚àë i=1 8 Œµ i e i ) : Œµ i = ¬±1, Œµ 1 ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢Œµ 8 = +1}.   The root system has 240 roots. The set just listed is the set of vectors of length ‚àö2 in the E8 root lattice, also known simply as the E8 lattice or Œì 8 . This is the set of points in R 8 such that:   all the coordinates are integers or all the coordinates are half-integers (a mixture of integers and half-integers is not allowed), and  the sum of the eight coordinates is an even integer .   Thus,   E 8 = { Œ± ‚àà Z 8 ‚à™ ( Z +¬Ω) 8 : | Œ± | 2 = ‚àë Œ± i 2 = 2, ‚àë Œ± i ‚àà 2 Z }.    The root system E 7 is the set of vectors in E 8 that are perpendicular to a fixed root in E 8 . The root system E 7 has 126 roots.  The root system E 6 is not the set of vectors in E 7 that are perpendicular to a fixed root in E 7 , indeed, one obtains D 6 that way. However, E 6 is the subsystem of E 8 perpendicular to two suitably chosen roots of E 8 . The root system E 6 has 72 roots.       Simple roots in E 8 even coordinates:     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     -¬Ω     An alternative description of the E 8 lattice which is sometimes convenient is as the set Œì' 8 of all points in R 8 such that   all the coordinates are integers and the sum of the coordinates is even, or  all the coordinates are half-integers and the sum of the coordinates is odd.   The lattices Œì 8 and Œì' 8 are isomorphic ; one may pass from one to the other by changing the signs of any odd number of coordinates. The lattice Œì 8 is sometimes called the even coordinate system for E 8 while the lattice Œì' 8 is called the odd coordinate system .  One choice of simple roots for E 8 in the even coordinate system with rows ordered by node order in the alternate (non-canonical) Dynkin diagrams (above) is:   Œ± i = e i ‚Äì e i+1 , for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ 6, and  Œ± 7 = e 7 + e 6    (the above choice of simple roots for D 7 ) along with   Œ± 8 = Œ≤ 0 =    -    1  2    (    ‚àë   i  =  1   8    e  i    )            1  2     superscript   subscript     i  1    8    subscript  e  i       -\textstyle\frac{1}{2}(\textstyle\sum_{i=1}^{8}e_{i})   = (-¬Ω,-¬Ω,-¬Ω,-¬Ω,-¬Ω,-¬Ω,-¬Ω,-¬Ω).       Simple roots in E 8 : odd coordinates     1     0     0     0     0     0     0     -¬Ω     One choice of simple roots for E 8 in the odd coordinate system with rows ordered by node order in alternate (non-canonical) Dynkin diagrams (above) is:   Œ± i = e i ‚Äì e i+1 , for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ 7   (the above choice of simple roots for A 7 ) along with   Œ± 8 = Œ≤ 5 , where  Œ≤ j =     1  2    (    -    ‚àë   i  =  1   j    e  i     +    ‚àë   i  =   j  +  1    8    e  i     )         1  2         superscript   subscript     i  1    j    subscript  e  i       superscript   subscript     i    j  1     8    subscript  e  i       \textstyle\frac{1}{2}(-\textstyle\sum_{i=1}^{j}e_{i}+\textstyle\sum_{i=j+1}^{8%
 }e_{i})   .   (Using Œ≤ 3 would give an isomorphic result. Using Œ≤ 1,7 or Œ≤ 2,6 would simply give A 8 or D 8 . As for Œ≤ 4 , its coordinates sum to 0, and the same is true for Œ± 1...7 , so they span only the 7-dimensional subspace for which the coordinates sum to 0; in fact ‚Äì2 Œ≤ 4 has coordinates (1,2,3,4,3,2,1) in the basis ( Œ± i ).)  Deleting Œ± 1 and then Œ± 2 gives sets of simple roots for E 7 and E 6 . Since perpendicularity to Œ± 1 means that the first two coordinates are equal, E 7 is then the subset of E 8 where the first two coordinates are equal, and similarly E 6 is the subset of E 8 where the first three coordinates are equal. This facilitates explicit definitions of E 7 and E 6 as:   E 7 = { Œ± ‚àà Z 7 ‚à™ ( Z +¬Ω) 7 ''' : ''' ‚àë Œ± i 2 + Œ± 1 2 = 2, ‚àë Œ± i + Œ± 1 ‚àà 2 Z },  E 6 = { Œ± ‚àà Z 6 ‚à™ ( Z +¬Ω) 6 ''' : ''' ‚àë Œ± i 2 + 2 Œ± 1 2 = 2, ‚àë Œ± i + 2 Œ± 1 ‚àà 2 Z }   F 4      Simple roots in F 4     1     0     0     -¬Ω        For F 4 , let V = R 4 , and let Œ¶ denote the set of vectors Œ± of length 1 or ‚àö2 such that the coordinates of 2Œ± are all integers and are either all even or all odd. There are 48 roots in this system. One choice of simple roots is: the choice of simple roots given above for B 3 , plus Œ± 4 = ‚Äì     1  2     ‚àë   i  =  1   4    e  i          1  2     superscript   subscript     i  1    4    subscript  e  i      \textstyle\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{4}e_{i}   .  The F 4 root lattice - that is, the lattice generated by the F 4 root system - is the set of points in R 4 such that either all the coordinates are integers or all the coordinates are half-integers (a mixture of integers and half-integers is not allowed). This lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of Hurwitz quaternions .  G 2      Simple roots in G 2     1     -1        The root system G 2 has 12 roots, which form the vertices of a hexagram . See the picture above .  One choice of simple roots is: ( Œ± 1 , Œ≤ = Œ± 2 ‚Äì Œ± 1 ) where Œ± i = e i ‚Äì e i+1 for i = 1, 2 is the above choice of simple roots for A 2 .  The G 2 root lattice - that is, the lattice generated by the G 2 roots - is the same as the A 2 root lattice.  Root systems and Lie theory  Irreducible root systems classify a number of related objects in Lie theory, notably the   simple Lie groups (see the list of simple Lie groups ), including the  simple complex Lie groups ;  their associated simple complex Lie algebras ; and  simply connected complex Lie groups which are simple modulo centers.   In each case, the roots are non-zero weights of the adjoint representation .  In the case of a simply connected simple compact Lie group G with maximal torus  T , the root lattice can naturally be identified with Hom( T , T ) and the coroot lattice with Hom( T , T ), where T is the circle group ; see .
