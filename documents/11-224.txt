Mannonate dehydratase

In enzymology, a mannonate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-mannonate 
 
 
 
  2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, D-mannonate, and two products, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-mannonate hydro-lyase (2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate-forming). Other names in common use include mannonic hydrolase, mannonate hydrolyase, altronic hydro-lyase, altronate hydrolase, D-mannonate hydrolyase, and D-mannonate hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
