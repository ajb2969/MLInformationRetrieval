   Sequential dynamical system      Sequential dynamical system   (Figure)  Phase space of the sequential dynamical system   Sequential dynamical systems (SDSs) are a class of graph dynamical systems . They are discrete dynamical systems which generalize many aspects of for example classical cellular automata , and they provide a framework for studying asynchronous processes over graphs . The analysis of SDSs uses techniques from combinatorics , abstract algebra , graph theory , dynamical systems and probability theory .  Definition  An SDS is constructed from the following components:    A finite graph  Y with vertex set v[ Y ] = {1,2, ... , n}. Depending on the context the graph can be directed or undirected.    A state x v for each vertex i of Y taken from a finite set K . The system state is the n -tuple x = ( x 1 , x 2 , ... , x n ), and x [ i ] is the tuple consisting of the states associated to the vertices in the 1-neighborhood of i in Y (in some fixed order).    A vertex function  f i for each vertex i . The vertex function maps the state of vertex i at time t to the vertex state at time t + 1 based on the states associated to the 1-neighborhood of i in Y .    A word w = ( w 1 , w 2 , ... , w m ) over v [ Y ].    It is convenient to introduce the Y -local maps F i constructed from the vertex functions by         F  i    (  x  )    =   (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x   i  -  1    ,    f  i    (   x   [  i  ]    )    ,   x   i  +  1    ,  …  ,   x  n   )    .         subscript  F  i   x     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x    i  1       subscript  f  i     x   delimited-[]  i      subscript  x    i  1    normal-…   subscript  x  n      F_{i}(x)=(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{i-1},f_{i}(x[i]),x_{i+1},\ldots,x_{n})\;.     The word w specifies the sequence in which the Y -local maps are composed to derive the sequential dynamical system map F : K n → K n as        [   F  Y   ,  w  ]   =    F   w   (  m  )     ∘   F   w   (   m  -  1   )     ∘  ⋯  ∘   F   w   (  2  )     ∘    F   w   (  1  )        .        subscript  F  Y   w      subscript  F    w  m     subscript  F    w    m  1     normal-⋯   subscript  F    w  2     subscript  F    w  1       [F_{Y},w]=F_{w(m)}\circ F_{w(m-1)}\circ\cdots\circ F_{w(2)}\circ F_{w(1)}\;.     If the update sequence is a permutation one frequently speaks of a permutation SDS to emphasize this point. The phase space associated to a sequential dynamical system with map F : K n → K n is the finite directed graph with vertex set K n and directed edges ( x , F ( x )). The structure of the phase space is governed by the properties of the graph Y , the vertex functions ( f i ) i , and the update sequence w . A large part of SDS research seeks to infer phase space properties based on the structure of the system constituents.  Example  Consider the case where Y is the graph with vertex set {1,2,3} and undirected edges {1,2}, {1,3} and {2,3} (a triangle or 3-circle) with vertex states from K = {0,1}. For vertex functions use the symmetric, boolean function nor : K 3 → K defined by nor( x , y , z ) = (1+ x )(1+ y )(1+ z ) with boolean arithmetic. Thus, the only case in which the function nor returns the value 1 is when all the arguments are 0. Pick w = (1,2,3) as update sequence. Starting from the initial system state (0,0,0) at time t = 0 one computes the state of vertex 1 at time t =1 as nor(0,0,0) = 1. The state of vertex 2 at time t =1 is nor(1,0,0) = 0. Note that the state of vertex 1 at time t =1 is used immediately. Next one obtains the state of vertex 3 at time t =1 as nor(1,0,0) = 0. This completes the update sequence, and one concludes that the Nor-SDS map sends the system state (0,0,0) to (1,0,0). The system state (1,0,0) is in turned mapped to (0,1,0) by an application of the SDS map.
