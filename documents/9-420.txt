Plucker matrix

Plucker matrices are a representation of a line used in relation to 3D homogeneous coordinates. Specifically, a Plucker matrix is a 4×4 skew-symmetric homogeneous matrix, defined as 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are two homogeneous coordinates on the line.1
P has rank 2. Its 2-dimensional null-space is spanned by the pencil of planes with the line as axis. It has 4 degrees of freedom.
