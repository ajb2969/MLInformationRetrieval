   Plucker matrix      Plucker matrix   Plucker matrices are a representation of a line used in relation to 3D  homogeneous coordinates . Specifically, a Plucker matrix is a 4×4 skew-symmetric homogeneous matrix, defined as    𝐏  =    A   B  T    -   B   A  T         𝐏      A   superscript  B  T      B   superscript  A  T       \mathbf{P}=AB^{T}-BA^{T}   , where   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are two homogeneous coordinates on the line. 1  P has rank 2. Its 2-dimensional null-space is spanned by the pencil of planes with the line as axis. It has 4 degrees of freedom.
