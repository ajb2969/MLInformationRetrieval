   Strong product of graphs      Strong product of graphs   In graph theory , the strong product  G ⊠ H of graphs G and H is a graph such that   the vertex set of G ⊠ H is the Cartesian product V(G) × V(H) ; and  any two distinct vertices (u,u') and (v,v') are adjacent in G × H  if and only if :     u   u   u   is adjacent to   v   v   v   and   u   u   u   =   v   v   v   , or     u   u   u   =   v   v   v   and   u   u   u   is adjacent to   v   v   v   , or     u   u   u   is adjacent to   v   v   v   and   u   u   u   is adjacent to   v   v   v       The strong product is also called the normal product and AND product . It was first introduced by Sabidussi in 1960.  Shannon capacity and Lovász number  The Shannon capacity of a graph is defined from the independence number of its strong products with itself, by the formula        Θ   (  G  )    =    sup  k     α   (   G  k   )    k    =    lim   k  →  ∞      α   (   G  k   )    k     ,          normal-Θ  G     subscript  supremum  k      k     α   superscript  G  k             subscript    normal-→  k        k     α   superscript  G  k         \Theta(G)=\sup_{k}\sqrt[k]{\alpha(G^{k})}=\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\sqrt[k]{%
 \alpha(G^{k})},    László Lovász showed that Lovász theta function is multiplicative: 1        ϑ   (   G  ⊠  H   )    =   ϑ   (  G  )   ϑ   (  H  )     .        ϑ   normal-⊠  G  H      ϑ  G  ϑ  H     \vartheta(G\boxtimes H)=\vartheta(G)\vartheta(H).   He used this fact to upper bound the Shannon capacity by the Lovász number.  See also   Graph product  Cartesian product of graphs  Tensor product of graphs   Notes  References     .
