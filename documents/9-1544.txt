Strong product of graphs

In graph theory, the strong product G ⊠ H of graphs G and H is a graph such that

the vertex set of G ⊠ H is the Cartesian product V(G) × V(H); and
any two distinct vertices (u,u') and (v,v') are adjacent in G × H if and only if:
 


 
  is adjacent to 
 
 
 
  and

  and 
 
 
 
  is adjacent to 
 
 
 
 , or


 
  is adjacent to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is adjacent to 
 
 



The strong product is also called the normal product and AND product. It was first introduced by Sabidussi in 1960.
Shannon capacity and Lovász number
The Shannon capacity of a graph is defined from the independence number of its strong products with itself, by the formula


László Lovász showed that Lovász theta function is multiplicative:1


 
  He used this fact to upper bound the Shannon capacity by the Lovász number.
