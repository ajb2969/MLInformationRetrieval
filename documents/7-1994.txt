In physics and mathematics, the Pauli group

 
  on 1 qubit is the 16-element matrix group consisting of the 2 × 2 identity matrix

 
  and all of the Pauli matrices


 
 , together with the products of these matrices with the factors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 :


 
 . The Pauli group is generated by the Pauli matrices, and like them it is named after Wolfgang Pauli.
The Pauli group on n qubits, 
 
 
 
 , is the group generated by the operators described above applied to each of 
 
 
 
  qubits in the tensor product Hilbert space

 
 .
