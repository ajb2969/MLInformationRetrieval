Logarithmically convex function

In mathematics, a function f defined on a convex subset of a real vector space and taking positive values is said to be logarithmically convex or superconvex1 if 
 
 
 
 , the composition of the logarithmic function with f, is a convex function. In effect the logarithm drastically slows down the growth of the original function 
 
 
 
 , so if the composition still retains the convexity property, this must mean that the original function 
 
 
 
  was 'really convex' to begin with, hence the term superconvex.
A logarithmically convex function f is a convex function since it is the composite of the increasing convex function 
 
 
 
  and the function 
 
 
 
 , which is supposed convex. The converse is not always true: for example 
 
 
 
  is a convex function, but 
 
 
 
  is not a convex function and thus 
 
 
 
  is not logarithmically convex. On the other hand, 
 
 
 
  is logarithmically convex since 
 
 
 
  is convex. An important example of a logarithmically convex function is the gamma function on the positive reals (see also the Bohrâ€“Mollerup theorem).
