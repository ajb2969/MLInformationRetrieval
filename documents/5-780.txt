   Logarithmically convex function      Logarithmically convex function   In mathematics , a function  f defined on a convex subset of a real  vector space and taking positive values is said to be logarithmically convex or superconvex 1 if    log  ∘  f       f    {\log}\circ f   , the composition of the logarithmic function with f , is a convex function . In effect the logarithm drastically slows down the growth of the original function   f   f   f   , so if the composition still retains the convexity property, this must mean that the original function   f   f   f   was 'really convex' to begin with, hence the term superconvex.  A logarithmically convex function f is a convex function since it is the composite of the increasing convex function   exp     \exp   and the function    log  ∘  f       f    \log\circ f   , which is supposed convex. The converse is not always true: for example    g  :   x  ↦   x  2       normal-:  g   maps-to  x   superscript  x  2      g:x\mapsto x^{2}   is a convex function, but     log  ∘  g   :   x  ↦   log   x  2    =   2   log   |  x  |         normal-:     g      maps-to  x     superscript  x  2           2      x         {\log}\circ g:x\mapsto\log x^{2}=2\log|x|   is not a convex function and thus   g   g   g   is not logarithmically convex. On the other hand,    x  ↦   e   x  2       maps-to  x   superscript  e   superscript  x  2      x\mapsto e^{x^{2}}   is logarithmically convex since    x  ↦   log   e   x  2     =   x  2        maps-to  x     superscript  e   superscript  x  2           superscript  x  2      x\mapsto\log e^{x^{2}}=x^{2}   is convex. An important example of a logarithmically convex function is the gamma function on the positive reals (see also the Bohr–Mollerup theorem ).  References   John B. Conway.
