Exponential hierarchy

In computational complexity theory, the exponential hierarchy is a hierarchy of complexity classes, which is an exponential time analogue of the polynomial hierarchy. As elsewhere in complexity theory, “exponential” is used in two different meanings (linear exponential bounds 
 
 
 
  for a constant c, and full exponential bounds 
 
 
 
 ), leading to two versions of the exponential hierarchy:12

EH is the union of the classes 
 
 
 
  for all k, where 
 
 
 
 
  (i.e., languages computable in nondeterministic time 
 
 
 
  for some constant c with a 
 
 
oracle). One also defines 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . An equivalent definition is that a language L is in 
 
 
 
 
  if and only if it can be written in the form








where 
 
 
 
  is a predicate computable in time 
 
 
 
  (which implicitly bounds the length of yi). Also equivalently, EH is the class of languages computable on an alternating Turing machine in time 
 
 
 
  for some c with constantly many alternations.
 


EXPH is the union of the classes 
 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  (languages computable in nondeterministic time 
 
 
 
  for some constant c with a 
 
 
 
  oracle), and again 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 . A language L is in 
 
 
 
  if and only if it can be written as








where 
 
 
 
  is computable in time 
 
 
 
  for some c, which again implicitly bounds the length of yi. Equivalently, EXPH is the class of languages computable in time 
 
 
 
 
  on an alternating Turing machine with constantly many alternations.
 

We have E ⊆ NE ⊆ EH ⊆ ESPACE, EXP ⊆ NEXP ⊆ EXPH ⊆ EXPSPACE, and EH ⊆ EXPH.
