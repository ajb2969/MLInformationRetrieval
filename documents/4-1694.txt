   National savings      National savings   In economics , a country's national savings is the sum of private and public savings . It is generally equal to a nation's income minus consumption and government purchases.  Economic model of national savings  In this simple economic model with a closed economy there are three uses for GDP , (the goods and services it produces in a year). If Y is national income (GDP), then the three uses of C consumption , I investment , and G government purchases can be expressed as:       Y  =   C  +  I  +  G       Y    C  I  G     Y=C+I+G      National savings can be thought of as the amount of remaining money that is not consumed, or spent by government. In a simple model of a closed economy, anything that is not spent is assumed to be invested :       National Savings  =   Y  -  C  -  G   =  I        National Savings    Y  C  G        I     \text{National Savings}=Y-C-G=I      National savings should be split into private savings and public savings . A new term, T is taxes paid by consumers that goes directly to the government as shown here:         (   Y  -  T  -  C   )   +   (   T  -  G   )    =  I          Y  T  C     T  G    I    (Y-T-C)+(T-G)=I      (Y - T) is disposable income. (Y - T) less consumption (C) is private savings. The term (T - G) is government revenue through taxes, minus government expenditures, which is public savings, also known as the Budget surplus .       S  =   I   (  r  )        S    I  r     S=I(r)      The interest rate plays the important role of creating an equilibrium between saving and investment.  In open economy model (balanced public spendings)  NX = Net eXports = eXports - iMports  NX = (X-M)  NX=Y-(C+I+G)=Y-Domestic demand  Y=C+I+G+NX = National accounts identity  Y-C-G= S =I+NX  S=I+NX = National savings  S-I = The portion of national savings not used to finance domestic investment = NX = Trade balance  In open economy model (public deficit or surplus)  (1) Y = C + I + G + (X - M) = National accounts identity  (2) Yd = Y - TAX + TR = Disposable income depending on aggregated demand, taxes and transfers  (3) Yd = S + C = Disposable income depending on savings and consumption  → (2),(3) S + C = Y - TAX + TR  (4) Y = S + C + TAX – TR = Aggregated demand  → (1),(4) C + I + G + (X – M) = S + C + TAX – TR  '' (5) S = (X - M) - (TAX - TR – G) + I = National savings ''  [ S - I + (TAX - TR – G) = The portion of national savings not used to finance domestic investment and public deficit = (X - M) = Trade balance ]  See also   Government debt  Inflation  IS/LM model   References  "  Category:Economies
