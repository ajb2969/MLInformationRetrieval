   E9 honeycomb      E9 honeycomb   In geometry , an E 9 honeycomb is a tessellation of uniform polytopes in hyperbolic 9-dimensional space.     T  ¯   9     subscript   normal-¯  T   9    {\bar{T}}_{9}   , also (E 10 ) is a paracompact hyperbolic group, so either facets or vertex figures will not be bounded.  E 10 is last of the series of Coxeter groups with a bifurcated Coxeter-Dynkin diagram of lengths 6,2,1. There are 1023 unique E 10 honeycombs by all combinations of its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram . There are no regular honeycombs in the family since its Coxeter diagram a nonlinear graph, but there are three simplest ones, with a single ring at the end of its 3 branches: 6 21 , 2 61 , 1 62 .  6 21 honeycomb      6 21 honeycomb       Family     Schläfli symbol     Coxeter symbol     Coxeter-Dynkin diagram     9-faces     8-faces     7-faces     6-faces     5-faces     4-faces     Cells     Faces     Vertex figure     Symmetry group     The 6 21 honeycomb is constructed from alternating 9-simplex and 9-orthoplex facets within the symmetry of the E 10 Coxeter group.  This honeycomb is highly regular in the sense that its symmetry group (the affine E 9 Weyl group) acts transitively on the k -faces for k ≤ 7. All of the k -faces for k ≤ 8 are simplices.  This honeycomb is last in the series of k 21 polytopes , enumerated by Thorold Gosset in 1900, listing polytopes and honeycombs constructed entirely of regular facets, although his list ended with the 8-dimensional the Euclidean honeycomb, 5 21 . 1  Construction  It is created by a Wythoff construction upon a set of 10 hyperplane mirrors in 9-dimensional hyperbolic space.  The facet information can be extracted from its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram .      Removing the node on the end of the 2-length branch leaves the 9-orthoplex , 7 11 .      Removing the node on the end of the 1-length branch leaves the 9-simplex .      The vertex figure is determined by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes the 5 21 honeycomb .      The edge figure is determined from the vertex figure by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes the 4 21 polytope .      The face figure is determined from the edge figure by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes the 3 21 polytope .      The cell figure is determined from the face figure by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes the 2 21 polytope .      Related polytopes and honeycombs  The 6 21 is last in a dimensional series of semiregular polytopes and honeycombs, identified in 1900 by Thorold Gosset . Each member of the sequence has the previous member as its vertex figure . All facets of these polytopes are regular polytopes , namely simplexes and orthoplexes .  2 61 honeycomb      2 61 honeycomb       Family     Schläfli symbol     Coxeter symbol     Coxeter-Dynkin diagram     9-face types     8-face types     7-face types     6-face types     5-face types     4-face type     Cells     Faces     Vertex figure     Coxeter group     The 2 61 honeycomb is composed of 2 51 9-honeycomb and 9-simplex  facets . It is the final figure in the 2 k1 family .  Construction  It is created by a Wythoff construction upon a set of 10 hyperplane mirrors in 9-dimensional hyperbolic space.  The facet information can be extracted from its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram .      Removing the node on the short branch leaves the 9-simplex .      Removing the node on the end of the 6-length branch leaves the 2 51 honeycomb . This is an infinite facet because E10 is a paracompact hyperbolic group.      The vertex figure is determined by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes the 9-demicube , 1 61 .      The edge figure is the vertex figure of the edge figure. This makes the rectified 8-simplex , 0 51 .      The face figure is determined from the edge figure by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes the 5-simplex prism.      {{-}}  Related polytopes and honeycombs  The 2 61 is last in a dimensional series of uniform polytopes and honeycombs.  1 62 honeycomb       1 62 honeycomb       Family     Schläfli symbol     Coxeter symbol     Coxeter-Dynkin diagram     9-face types     8-face types     7-face types     6-face types     5-face types     4-face type     Cells     Faces     Vertex figure     Coxeter group     The 1 62 honeycomb contains 1 52 (9-honeycomb) and 1 61  9-demicube  facets . It is the final figure in the 1 k2 polytope family.  Construction  It is created by a Wythoff construction upon a set of 10 hyperplane mirrors in 9-dimensional space.  The facet information can be extracted from its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram .      Removing the node on the end of the 2-length branch leaves the 9-demicube , 1 61 .      Removing the node on the end of the 6-length branch leaves the 1 52 honeycomb .      The vertex figure is determined by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes the birectified 9-simplex , 0 62 .      {{-}}  Related polytopes and honeycombs  The 1 62 is last in a dimensional series of uniform polytopes and honeycombs.
