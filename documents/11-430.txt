   Acetylsalicylate deacetylase      Acetylsalicylate deacetylase   In enzymology , an acetylsalicylate deacetylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetylsalicylate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   salicylate + acetate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetylsalicylate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are salicylate and acetate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetylsalicylate O-acetylhydrolase . Other names in common use include aspirin esterase , aspirin esterase , acetylsalicylic acid esterase , and aspirin hydrolase .
