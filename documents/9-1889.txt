   Lissajous knot      Lissajous knot   In knot theory , a Lissajous knot is a knot defined by parametric equations of the form        x  =   cos   (     n  x   t   +   ϕ  x    )     ,    y  =   cos   (     n  y   t   +   ϕ  y    )     ,   z  =   cos   (     n  z   t   +   ϕ  z    )       ,     formulae-sequence    x         subscript  n  x   t    subscript  ϕ  x       formulae-sequence    y         subscript  n  y   t    subscript  ϕ  y        z         subscript  n  z   t    subscript  ϕ  z         x=\cos(n_{x}t+\phi_{x}),\qquad y=\cos(n_{y}t+\phi_{y}),\qquad z=\cos(n_{z}t+%
 \phi_{z}),     where    n  x     subscript  n  x    n_{x}   ,    n  y     subscript  n  y    n_{y}   , and    n  z     subscript  n  z    n_{z}   are integers and the phase shifts     ϕ  x     subscript  ϕ  x    \phi_{x}   ,    ϕ  y     subscript  ϕ  y    \phi_{y}   , and    ϕ  z     subscript  ϕ  z    \phi_{z}   may be any real numbers . 1  The projection of a Lissajous knot onto any of the three coordinate planes is a Lissajous curve , and many of the properties of these knots are closely related to properties of Lissajous curves.  Replacing the cosine function in the parametrization by a triangle wave transforms every Lissajous knot isotopically into a billiard curve inside a cube, the simplest case of so-called billiard knots . Billiard knots can also be studied in other domains, for instance in a cylinder. 2  Form  Because a knot cannot be self-intersecting, the three integers     n  x   ,   n  y   ,   n  z       subscript  n  x    subscript  n  y    subscript  n  z     n_{x},n_{y},n_{z}   must be pairwise relatively prime , and none of the quantities         n  x    ϕ  y    -    n  y    ϕ  x     ,     n  y    ϕ  z    -    n  z    ϕ  y     ,     n  z    ϕ  x    -    n  x    ϕ  z             subscript  n  x    subscript  ϕ  y       subscript  n  y    subscript  ϕ  x          subscript  n  y    subscript  ϕ  z       subscript  n  z    subscript  ϕ  y          subscript  n  z    subscript  ϕ  x       subscript  n  x    subscript  ϕ  z       n_{x}\phi_{y}-n_{y}\phi_{x},\quad n_{y}\phi_{z}-n_{z}\phi_{y},\quad n_{z}\phi_%
 {x}-n_{x}\phi_{z}     may be an integer multiple of pi . Moreover, by making a substitution of the form     t  ′   =   t  +  c        superscript  t  normal-′     t  c     t^{\prime}=t+c   , one may assume that any of the three phase shifts    ϕ  x     subscript  ϕ  x    \phi_{x}   ,    ϕ  y     subscript  ϕ  y    \phi_{y}   ,    ϕ  z     subscript  ϕ  z    \phi_{z}   is equal to zero.  Examples  Here are some examples of Lissajous knots, 3 all of which have     ϕ  z   =  0       subscript  ϕ  z   0    \phi_{z}=0   :  Image:Lissajous 5_2 Knot.png| Three-twist knot      (   n  x   ,   n  y   ,   n  z   )   =   (  3  ,  2  ,  7  )         subscript  n  x    subscript  n  y    subscript  n  z     3  2  7     (n_{x},n_{y},n_{z})=(3,2,7)         (   ϕ  x   ,   ϕ  y   )   =   (  0.7  ,  0.2  )         subscript  ϕ  x    subscript  ϕ  y     0.7  0.2     (\phi_{x},\phi_{y})=(0.7,0.2)   Image:Lissajous Stevedore Knot.png| Stevedore knot      (   n  x   ,   n  y   ,   n  z   )   =   (  3  ,  2  ,  5  )         subscript  n  x    subscript  n  y    subscript  n  z     3  2  5     (n_{x},n_{y},n_{z})=(3,2,5)         (   ϕ  x   ,   ϕ  y   )   =   (  1.5  ,  0.2  )         subscript  ϕ  x    subscript  ϕ  y     1.5  0.2     (\phi_{x},\phi_{y})=(1.5,0.2)   Image:Lissajous Square Knot.png| Square knot      (   n  x   ,   n  y   ,   n  z   )   =   (  3  ,  5  ,  7  )         subscript  n  x    subscript  n  y    subscript  n  z     3  5  7     (n_{x},n_{y},n_{z})=(3,5,7)         (   ϕ  x   ,   ϕ  y   )   =   (  0.7  ,  1.0  )         subscript  ϕ  x    subscript  ϕ  y     0.7  1.0     (\phi_{x},\phi_{y})=(0.7,1.0)   Image:Lissajous 8_21 Knot.png|8 21 knot      (   n  x   ,   n  y   ,   n  z   )   =   (  3  ,  4  ,  7  )         subscript  n  x    subscript  n  y    subscript  n  z     3  4  7     (n_{x},n_{y},n_{z})=(3,4,7)         (   ϕ  x   ,   ϕ  y   )   =   (  0.1  ,  0.7  )         subscript  ϕ  x    subscript  ϕ  y     0.1  0.7     (\phi_{x},\phi_{y})=(0.1,0.7)     There are infinitely many different Lissajous knots, 4 and other examples with 10 or fewer crossings include the 7 4 knot, the 8 15 knot, the 10 1 knot, the 10 35 knot, the 10 58 knot, and the composite knot 5 2 * # 5 2 , 5 as well as the 9 16 knot, 10 76 knot, the 10 99 knot, the 10 122 knot, the 10 144 knot, the granny knot , and the composite knot 5 2 # 5 2 . 6 In addition, it is known that every twist knot with Arf invariant zero is a Lissajous knot. 7  Symmetry  Lissajous knots are highly symmetric, though the type of symmetry depends on whether or not the numbers    n  x     subscript  n  x    n_{x}   ,    n  y     subscript  n  y    n_{y}   , and    n  z     subscript  n  z    n_{z}   are all odd.  Odd case  If    n  x     subscript  n  x    n_{x}   ,    n  y     subscript  n  y    n_{y}   , and    n  z     subscript  n  z    n_{z}   are all odd, then the point reflection across the origin     (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )   ↦   (   -  x   ,   -  y   ,   -  z   )      maps-to   x  y  z      x     y     z      (x,y,z)\mapsto(-x,-y,-z)   is a symmetry of the Lissajous knot which preserves the knot orientation.  In general, a knot that has an orientation-preserving point reflection symmetry is known as strongly plus amphicheiral . 8 This is a fairly rare property: only three prime knots with twelve or fewer crossings are strongly plus amphicheiral prime knot , the first of which has crossing number ten. 9 Since this is so rare, most Lissajous knots lie in the even case.  Even case  If one of the frequencies (say    n  x     subscript  n  x    n_{x}   ) is even, then the 180° rotation around the x -axis     (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )   ↦   (  x  ,   -  y   ,   -  z   )      maps-to   x  y  z    x    y     z      (x,y,z)\mapsto(x,-y,-z)   is a symmetry of the Lissajous knot. In general, a knot that has a symmetry of this type is called 2-periodic , so every even Lissajous knot must be 2-periodic.  Consequences  The symmetry of a Lissajous knot puts severe constraints on the Alexander polynomial . In the odd case, the Alexander polynomial of the Lissajous knot must be a perfect square . 10 In the even case, the Alexander polynomial must be a perfect square modulo 2. 11 In addition, the Arf invariant of a Lissajous knot must be zero. It follows that:   The trefoil knot and figure-eight knot are not Lissajous.  No torus knot can be Lissajous.  No fibered  2-bridge knot can be Lissajous.
