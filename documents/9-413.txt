Further development  In 1971, Vitali Milman gave a new proof of Dvoretzky's theorem, making use of the concentration of measure on the sphere to show that a random k -dimensional subspace satisfies the above inequality with probability very close to 1. The proof gives the sharp dependence on k :        N   (  k  ,  ϵ  )    ≤   exp   (   C   (  ϵ  )   k   )     .        N   k  ϵ        C  ϵ  k      N(k,\epsilon)\leq\exp(C(\epsilon)k).     Equivalently, for every Banach space ( X ,  ‖.‖) of dimension N , there exists a subspace E ⊂ X of dimension k ≥ c ( ε ) log N and a Euclidean norm |.| on E such that the inequality above holds.  More precisely, let S n − 1 denote the unit sphere with respect to some Euclidean structure Q , and let σ be the invariant probability measure on S n − 1 . Then:   For any Q , there exists such a subspace E with          k  =   dim  E   ≥   c   (  ϵ  )      (      ∫   S   n  -  1        ∥  ξ  ∥   d  σ   (  ξ  )       max   ξ  ∈   S   n  -  1       ∥  ξ  ∥     )   2    N    .        k   dimension  E          c  ϵ   superscript      subscript    superscript  S    n  1        norm  ξ   d  σ  ξ      subscript     ξ   superscript  S    n  1       norm  ξ     2   N      k=\dim E\geq c(\epsilon)\,\left(\frac{\int_{S^{n-1}}\|\xi\|\,d\sigma(\xi)}{%
 \max_{\xi\in S^{n-1}}\|\xi\|}\right)^{2}\,N.         For any X one may choose Q so that the term in the brackets will be at most           c  1      log  N   N     .       subscript  c  1         N   N      c_{1}\sqrt{\frac{\log N}{N}}.        Here c 1 is a universal constant. The best possible k is denoted k * ( X ) and called the Dvoretzky dimension of X .  The dependence on ε was studied by Yehoram Gordon , 2 3 who showed that k * ( X ) ≥ c 2  ε 2 log N . Another proof of this result was given by Gideon Schechtman . 4  Noga Alon and Vitali Milman showed that the logarithmic bound on the dimension of the subspace in Dvoretzky's theorem can be significantly improved, if one is willing to accept a subspace that is close either to a Euclidean space or to a Chebyshev space . Specifically, for some constant c , every n -dimensional space has a subspace of dimension k ≥ exp(c√(log N )) that is close either to ℓ or to ℓ . 5  Important related results were proved by Tadeusz Figiel , Joram Lindenstrauss and Milman. 6  References  "  Category:Banach spaces  Category:Asymptotic geometric analysis  Category:Theorems in functional analysis     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  . ↩  , expanded in "The dimension of almost spherical sections of convex bodies", Acta Math. 139 (1977), 53–94. ↩
