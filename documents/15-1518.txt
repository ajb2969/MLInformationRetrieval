Meyer wavelet

The Meyer wavelet is an orthogonal wavelet proposed by Yves Meyer. It is infinitely differentiable with infinite support and defined in frequency domain in terms of function 
 
 
 
  as:



where:


 
  There are many different ways for defining this auxiliary function, which yields variants of the Meyer wavelet. For instance, another standard implementation adopts

The Meyer scale function is given by:



In the time-domain, the waveform of the Meyer mother-wavelet has the shape as shown in the following figure:
