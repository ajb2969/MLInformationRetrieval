Covariance intersection

Covariance intersection is an algorithm for combining two or more estimates of state variables in a Kalman filter when the correlation between them is unknown.1234
Specification
Items of information a and b are known and are to be fused into information item c. We know a and b have mean/covariance 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , but the cross correlation is not known. The covariance intersection update gives mean and covariance for c as






where ω is computed to minimize a selected norm, e.g., logdet or trace. While it is necessary to solve an optimization problem for higher dimensions, closed-form solutions exist for lower dimensions.5 CI can be used in place of the conventional Kalman update equations to ensure that the resulting estimate is conservative, regardless of the correlation between the two estimates, with covariance strictly non-increasing according to the chosen measure. The use of a fixed measure is necessary for rigor to ensure that a sequence of updates does not cause the filtered covariance to increase.67
