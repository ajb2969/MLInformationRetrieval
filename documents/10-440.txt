Psychrometric constant

The psychrometric constant

 
  relates the partial pressure of water in air to the air temperature. This lets one interpolate actual vapor pressure from paired dry and wet thermometer bulb temperature readings.1










 
  psychrometric constant [kPa °C−1],

P = atmospheric pressure [kPa],
 



latent heat of water vaporization, 2.26 [MJ kg−1],


specific heat of air at constant pressure, [MJ kg−1 °C−1],


 
  ratio molecular weight of water vapor/dry air = 0.622.
Both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are constants.
 Since atmospheric pressure, P, depends upon altitude, so does 
 
 
 
 .
 At higher altitude water evaporates and boils at lower temperature.
Although 
 
 
 
  is constant, varied air composition results in varied 
 
 
 
 .
Thus on average, at a given location or altitude, the psychrometric constant is approximately constant. Still, it is worth remembering that weather impacts both atmospheric pressure and composition.

 Actual vapor pressure, 
 
 


here e[T] is vapor pressure as a function of temperature, T.
 
Tdew = the dewpoint temperature at which water condenses.
 
Twet = the temperature of a wet thermometer bulb from which water can evaporate to air.
 
Tdry = the temperature of a dry thermometer bulb in air.
