   Psychrometric constant      Psychrometric constant   The psychrometric constant    γ   γ   \gamma   relates the partial pressure of water in air to the air temperature. This lets one interpolate actual vapor pressure from paired dry and wet thermometer bulb temperature readings. 1        γ  =      (   c  p   )    a  i  r    *  P      λ  v   *  M    W   r  a  t  i  o          γ       subscript   subscript  c  p     a  i  r    P        subscript  λ  v   M    subscript  W    r  a  t  i  o        \gamma=\frac{\left(c_{p}\right)_{air}*P}{\lambda_{v}*MW_{ratio}}            γ  =       γ  absent    \gamma=   psychrometric constant [kPa °C −1 ],   P = atmospheric pressure [kPa],        λ  v   =        subscript  λ  v   absent    \lambda_{v}=    latent heat of water vaporization, 2.26 [MJ kg −1 ],       c  p   =        subscript  c  p   absent    c_{p}=    specific heat of air at constant pressure, [MJ kg −1 °C −1 ],       M   W   r  a  t  i  o     =         M   subscript  W    r  a  t  i  o     absent    MW_{ratio}=   ratio molecular weight of water vapor/dry air = 0.622.  Both    λ  v     subscript  λ  v    \lambda_{v}   and    M   W   r  a  t  i  o        M   subscript  W    r  a  t  i  o      MW_{ratio}   are constants. Since atmospheric pressure , P, depends upon altitude, so does   γ   γ   \gamma   . At higher altitude water evaporates and boils at lower temperature.  Although     (   c  p   )     H  2   O      subscript   subscript  c  p      subscript  H  2   O     \left(c_{p}\right)_{H_{2}O}   is constant, varied air composition results in varied     (   c  p   )    a  i  r      subscript   subscript  c  p     a  i  r     \left(c_{p}\right)_{air}   .  Thus on average, at a given location or altitude, the psychrometric constant is approximately constant. Still, it is worth remembering that weather impacts both atmospheric pressure and composition.  vapor pressure estimation  Saturated vapor pressure,     e  s   =   e   [   T   w  e  t    ]         subscript  e  s     e   delimited-[]   subscript  T    w  e  t        e_{s}=e\left[T_{wet}\right]    Actual vapor pressure,     e  a   =    e  s   -   γ  *   (    T   d  r  y    -   T   w  e  t     )          subscript  e  a      subscript  e  s     γ     subscript  T    d  r  y     subscript  T    w  e  t         e_{a}=e_{s}-\gamma*\left(T_{dry}-T_{wet}\right)      here e[T] is vapor pressure as a function of temperature, T.  T dew = the dewpoint temperature at which water condenses.  T wet = the temperature of a wet thermometer bulb from which water can evaporate to air.  T dry = the temperature of a dry thermometer bulb in air.
