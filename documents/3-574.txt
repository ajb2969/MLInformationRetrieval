Index set

In mathematics, an index set is a set whose members label (or index) members of another set.12 For instance, if the elements of a set A may be indexed or labeled by means of a set J, then J is an index set. The indexing consists of a surjective function from J onto A and the indexed collection is typically called an (indexed) family, often written as (Aj)jâˆˆJ.
Examples

An enumeration of a set 
 
 
 
  gives an index set

Any countably infinite set can be indexed by

For

The set of all the 
 
 
 
  functions is an uncountable set indexed by

Other uses
In computational complexity theory and cryptography, an index set is a set for which there exists an algorithm I that can sample the set efficiently; i.e., on input 1n, I can efficiently select a poly(n)-bit long element from the set.3
