Schur's inequality

In mathematics, Schur's inequality, named after Issai Schur, establishes that for all non-negative real numbers x, y, z and a positive number t,



with equality if and only if x = y = z or two of them are equal and the other is zero. When t is an even positive integer, the inequality holds for all real numbers x, y and z.
When 
 
 
 
 , the following well-known special case can be derived:



Proof
Since the inequality is symmetric in 
 
 
 
  we may assume without loss of generality that 
 
 
 
 . Then the inequality



clearly holds, since every term on the left-hand side of the equation is non-negative. This rearranges to Schur's inequality.
Extension
A generalization of Schur's inequality is the following: Suppose a,b,c are positive real numbers. If the triples (a,b,c) and (x,y,z) are similarly sorted, then the following inequality holds:



In 2007, Romanian mathematician Valentin Vornicu showed that a yet further generalized form of Schur's inequality holds:
Consider 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , and either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be either convex or monotonic. Then,


 
  The standard form of Schur's is the case of this inequality where x = a, y = b, z = c, k = 1, ƒ(m) = mr.1
