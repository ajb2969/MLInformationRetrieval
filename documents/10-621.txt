   Tropinone reductase II      Tropinone reductase II   In enzymology , a tropinone reductase II () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   pseudotropine + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   tropinone + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are pseudotropine and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are tropinone , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pseudotropine:NADP + 3-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include tropinone (psi-tropine-forming) reductase , pseudotropine forming tropinone reductase , tropinone reductase (ambiguous) , and TR-II . This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis ii .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
