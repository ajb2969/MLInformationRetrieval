   Atkinson friction factor      Atkinson friction factor   Atkinson friction factor is a measure of the resistance to airflow of a duct. It is widely used in the mine ventilation industry but is rarely referred to outside of it.  Atkinson friction factor is represented by the symbol   k   k   k   and has the same units as air density (kilograms per cubic metre in SI units , lbfmin^2/ft^4 in Imperial units ). It is related to the more widespread Fanning friction factor by       k  =    1  2   ρ  f    ,      k      1  2   ρ  f     k=\frac{1}{2}\rho f,     in which   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the density of air in the shaft or roadway under consideration and   f   f   f   is Fanning friction factor (dimensionless). It is related to the Darcy friction factor by       k  =    1  2   ρ   λ  4     ,      k      1  2   ρ    λ  4      k=\frac{1}{2}\rho\frac{\lambda}{4},     in which   λ   λ   \lambda   is the Darcy friction factor (dimensionless).  It was introduced by John J Atkinson in an early mathematical treatment of mine ventilation (1862) and has been known under his name ever since.
