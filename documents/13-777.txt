Werner state

A Werner state1 is a -dimensional bipartite quantum state density matrix that is invariant under all unitary operators of the form 
 
 
 
 . That is, it is a quantum state ρ that satisfies


 
  for all unitary operators U acting on d-dimensional Hilbert space.
Every Werner state is a mixture of projectors onto the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, with the relative weight psym being the only parameter that defines the state.


 
  where



 
  are the projectors and


 
  is the permutation operator that exchanges the two subsystems.
Werner states are separable for psym ≥ 
 
 
 
  and entangled for psym ${1}/{2}$. All entangled Werner states violate the PPT separability criterion, but for d ≥ 3 no Werner states violate the weaker reduction criterion. Werner states can be parametrized in different ways. One way of writing them is


 
  where the new parameter α varies between −1 and 1 and relates to psym as



Multipartite Werner states
Werner states can be generalized to the multipartite case.2 An N-party Werner state is a state that is invariant under 
 
 
 
  for any unitary U on a single subsystem. The Werner state is no longer described by a single parameter, but by N! − 1 parameters, and is a linear combination of the N! different permutations on N systems.
