   Cellobiose phosphorylase      Cellobiose phosphorylase   In enzymology , a cellobiose phosphorylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cellobiose + phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate + D-glucose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cellobiose and phosphate , whereas its two products are alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate and D-glucose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cellobiose:phosphate alpha-D-glucosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2006, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
