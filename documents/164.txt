   Dynamic risk measure      Dynamic risk measure   In financial mathematics , a conditional risk measure is a random variable of the financial risk (particularly the downside risk ) as if measured at some point in the future. A risk measure can be thought of as a conditional risk measure on the trivial sigma algebra .  A dynamic risk measure is a risk measure that deals with the question of how evaluations of risk at different times are related. It can be interpreted as a sequence of conditional risk measures. 1  Conditional risk measure  A mapping     ρ  t   :     L  ∞    (   ℱ  T   )    →   L  t  ∞   =    L  ∞    (   ℱ  t   )        normal-:   subscript  ρ  t      normal-→     superscript  L     subscript  ℱ  T     subscript   superscript  L    t           superscript  L     subscript  ℱ  t        \rho_{t}:L^{\infty}\left(\mathcal{F}_{T}\right)\rightarrow L^{\infty}_{t}=L^{%
 \infty}\left(\mathcal{F}_{t}\right)   is a conditional risk measure if it has the following properties:   Conditional cash invariance        ∀   m  t    ∈   L  t  ∞    :     ρ  t    (   X  +   m  t    )    =     ρ  t    (  X  )    -   m  t        normal-:     for-all   subscript  m  t     subscript   superscript  L    t         subscript  ρ  t     X   subscript  m  t          subscript  ρ  t   X    subscript  m  t       \forall m_{t}\in L^{\infty}_{t}:\;\rho_{t}(X+m_{t})=\rho_{t}(X)-m_{t}       Monotonicity        If   X   ≤    Y    then    ρ  t    (  X  )    ≥    ρ  t    (  Y  )            If  X     Y  then   subscript  ρ  t   X           subscript  ρ  t   Y      \mathrm{If}\;X\leq Y\;\mathrm{then}\;\rho_{t}(X)\geq\rho_{t}(Y)       Normalization        ρ  t    (  0  )    =  0         subscript  ρ  t   0   0    \rho_{t}(0)=0      If it is a conditional convex risk measure then it will also have the property:   Conditional convexity         ∀  λ   ∈   L  t  ∞    ,   0  ≤  λ  ≤  1    :     ρ  t    (    λ  X   +    (   1  -  λ   )   Y    )    ≤    λ   ρ  t    (  X  )    +    (   1  -  λ   )    ρ  t    (  Y  )         normal-:   formulae-sequence     for-all  λ    subscript   superscript  L    t        0  λ       1          subscript  ρ  t       λ  X       1  λ   Y         λ   subscript  ρ  t   X       1  λ    subscript  ρ  t   Y       \forall\lambda\in L^{\infty}_{t},0\leq\lambda\leq 1:\rho_{t}(\lambda X+(1-%
 \lambda)Y)\leq\lambda\rho_{t}(X)+(1-\lambda)\rho_{t}(Y)      A conditional coherent risk measure is a conditional convex risk measure that additionally satisfies:   Conditional positive homogeneity         ∀  λ   ∈   L  t  ∞    ,   λ  ≥  0    :     ρ  t    (   λ  X   )    =   λ   ρ  t    (  X  )        normal-:   formulae-sequence     for-all  λ    subscript   superscript  L    t      λ  0         subscript  ρ  t     λ  X      λ   subscript  ρ  t   X      \forall\lambda\in L^{\infty}_{t},\lambda\geq 0:\rho_{t}(\lambda X)=\lambda\rho%
 _{t}(X)      Acceptance set  The acceptance set at time   t   t   t   associated with a conditional risk measure is       A  t   =   {   X  ∈   L  T  ∞    :    ρ   (  X  )    ≤   0  a.s.    }        subscript  A  t    conditional-set    X   subscript   superscript  L    T        ρ  X     0  a.s.       A_{t}=\{X\in L^{\infty}_{T}:\rho(X)\leq 0\text{ a.s.}\}   .  If you are given an acceptance set at time   t   t   t   then the corresponding conditional risk measure is       ρ  t   =   ess   inf   {   Y  ∈   L  t  ∞    :    X  +  Y   ∈   A  t    }          subscript  ρ  t     ess   infimum   conditional-set    Y   subscript   superscript  L    t        X  Y    subscript  A  t         \rho_{t}=\text{ess}\inf\{Y\in L^{\infty}_{t}:X+Y\in A_{t}\}   where    ess  inf      ess  infimum    \text{ess}\inf   is the essential infimum . 2  Regular property  A conditional risk measure    ρ  t     subscript  ρ  t    \rho_{t}   is said to be regular if for any    X  ∈   L  T  ∞       X   subscript   superscript  L    T     X\in L^{\infty}_{T}   and    A  ∈   ℱ  t       A   subscript  ℱ  t     A\in\mathcal{F}_{t}   then      ρ  t    (    1  A   X   )    =    1  A    ρ  t    (  X  )           subscript  ρ  t      subscript  1  A   X       subscript  1  A    subscript  ρ  t   X     \rho_{t}(1_{A}X)=1_{A}\rho_{t}(X)   where    1  A     subscript  1  A    1_{A}   is the indicator function on   A   A   A   . Any normalized conditional convex risk measure is regular. 3  The financial interpretation of this states that the conditional risk at some future node (i.e.     ρ  t    (  X  )    [  ω  ]        subscript  ρ  t   X   delimited-[]  ω     \rho_{t}(X)[\omega]   ) only depends on the possible states from that node. In a binomial model this would be akin to calculating the risk on the subtree branching off from the point in question.  Time consistent property  A dynamic risk measure is time consistent if and only if       ρ   t  +  1     (  X  )    ≤    ρ   t  +  1     (  Y  )    ⇒    ρ  t    (  X  )    ≤    ρ  t    (  Y  )    ∀  X     ,   Y  ∈    L  0    (   ℱ  T   )        formulae-sequence         subscript  ρ    t  1    X      subscript  ρ    t  1    Y     normal-⇒       subscript  ρ  t   X           subscript  ρ  t   Y   for-all  X        Y     superscript  L  0    subscript  ℱ  T       \rho_{t+1}(X)\leq\rho_{t+1}(Y)\Rightarrow\rho_{t}(X)\leq\rho_{t}(Y)\;\forall X%
 ,Y\in L^{0}(\mathcal{F}_{T})   . 4  Example: dynamic superhedging price  The dynamic superhedging price has conditional risk measures of the form     ρ  t    (  -  X  )   =    ess  sup    Q  ∈   E  M  M      𝔼  Q    [  X  |   ℱ  t   ]      fragments   subscript  ρ  t    fragments  normal-(   X  normal-)     subscript    ess  supremum     Q    E  M  M      superscript  𝔼  Q    fragments  normal-[  X  normal-|   subscript  ℱ  t   normal-]     \rho_{t}(-X)=\operatorname*{ess\sup}_{Q\in EMM}\mathbb{E}^{Q}[X|\mathcal{F}_{t}]   . It is a widely shown result that this is also a time consistent risk measure.  References  "  Category:Financial risk  Category:Mathematical finance     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
