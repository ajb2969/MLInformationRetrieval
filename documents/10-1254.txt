   4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase      4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-hydroxyphenylacetate + NADH + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde , NAD + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are 4-hydroxyphenylacetate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called 4-HPAL dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism .
