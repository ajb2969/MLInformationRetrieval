   Stilb (unit)      Stilb (unit)   The stilb ( sb ) is the CGS unit of luminance for objects that are not self-luminous. It is equal to one candela per square centimeter or 10 4  nits (candelas per square meter). The name was coined by the French physicist André Blondel around 1920. 1 It comes from the Greek word stilbein meaning "to glitter".  It was in common use in Europe up to World War I . In North America self-explanatory terms such as candle per square inch and candle per square meter were more common. 2 The unit has since largely been replaced by the SI unit: candela per square meter . The current national standard for SI in the United States discourages the use of the stilb. 3  Unit conversion        1    cd   m  2     =     10   -  4     sb         1    cd   superscript  normal-m  2        superscript  10    4    sb     \mathrm{1\,\frac{cd}{m^{2}}=10^{-4}\,sb}           1   sb   =    1    cd   cm  2     =     10  4     cd   m  2             1  sb     1    cd   superscript  cm  2             superscript  10  4     cd   superscript  normal-m  2        \mathrm{1\,sb=1\,\frac{cd}{cm^{2}}=10^{4}\,\frac{cd}{m^{2}}}           1   sb   =     10  4    nit   =     10  7    millinit           1  sb      superscript  10  4   nit           superscript  10  7   millinit      \mathrm{1\,sb=10^{4}\,nit=10^{7}\,millinit}           1   sb   =   1   π   L   =    10  3    π   mL   =     10  4     π   asb   =    10  4    π   blondel   =    10  7    π   sk   =    10  11    π   bril           1  sb     1  π  normal-L           superscript  10  3   π  mL           superscript  10  4   π  asb           superscript  10  4   π  blondel           superscript  10  7   π  sk           superscript  10  11   π  bril      \mathrm{1\,sb=1\pi\,L=10^{3}\pi\,mL=10^{4}\,\pi\,asb=10^{4}\pi\,blondel=10^{7}%
