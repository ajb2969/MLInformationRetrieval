   Neyman construction      Neyman construction   Neyman construction is a frequentist method to construct an interval at a confidence level     C    C   C\,   that if we repeat the experiment many times the interval will contain the true value a fraction    C    C   C\,   of the time.  Coverage probability  The probability that the interval contains the true value is called the coverage probability .  Implementation  A Neyman construction is carried out by performing pseudo-experiments , i.e. constructing data sets corresponding to a given value of the parameter. The pseudo-experiments are fitted with conventional methods, and the space of fitted parameter values constitutes the band of which the confidence interval can be selected from.
