   4-methyleneglutaminase      4-methyleneglutaminase   In enzymology , a 4-methyleneglutaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-methylene-L-glutamine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-methylene-L-glutamate + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-methylene-L-glutamine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 4-methylene-L-glutamate and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-methylene-L-glutamine amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include 4-methyleneglutamine deamidase , and 4-methyleneglutamine amidohydrolase . This enzyme participates in c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
