Acetoxybutynylbithiophene deacetylase

In enzymology, an acetoxybutynylbithiophene deacetylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

5-(4-acetoxybut-1-ynyl)-2,2'-bithiophene + H2O 
 
 
 
  5-(4-hydroxybut-1-ynyl)-2,2'-bithiophene + acetate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5-(4-acetoxybut-1-ynyl)-2,2'-bithiophene and H2O, whereas its two products are 5-(4-hydroxybut-1-ynyl)-2,2'-bithiophene and acetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-(4-acetoxybut-1-ynyl)-2,2'-bithiophene O-acetylhydrolase. Other names in common use include acetoxybutynylbithiophene esterase, and 5-(4-acetoxy-1-butynyl)-2,2'-bithiophene:acetate esterase.
