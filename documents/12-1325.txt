Blossom (functional)

In numerical analysis, a blossom is a functional that can be applied to any polynomial, but is mostly used for Bézier and spline curves and surfaces.
The blossom of a polynomial ƒ, often denoted 
 
 
 
  is completely characterised by the three properties:

It is a symmetric function of its arguments:








(where π is any permutation of its arguments).
 


It is affine in each of its arguments:










It satisfies the diagonal property:
