Von Zeipel theorem

In astrophysics, the von Zeipel theorem states that the radiative flux

 
  in a uniformly rotating star is proportional to the local effective gravity 
 
 
 
 . Specifically,



where the luminosity 
 
 
 
  and mass 
 
 
 
  are evaluated on a surface of constant pressure 
 
 
 
 . The effective temperature

 
  can then be found at a given colatitude

 
  from the local effective gravity

The theorem is named after Swedish astronomer Edvard Hugo von Zeipel.
