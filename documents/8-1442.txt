   Von Zeipel theorem      Von Zeipel theorem   In astrophysics , the von Zeipel theorem states that the radiative flux    F   F   F   in a uniformly rotating star is proportional to the local effective gravity    g  eff     subscript  g  eff    g_{\textrm{eff}}   . Specifically,      F  =   -     L   (  P  )     4  π  G   M  *    (  P  )      g  eff         F          L  P     4  π  G   subscript  M    P     subscript  g  eff       F=-\frac{L(P)}{4\pi GM_{*}(P)}g_{\textrm{eff}}     where the luminosity   L   L   L   and mass    M  *     subscript  M     M_{*}   are evaluated on a surface of constant pressure   P   P   P   . The effective temperature     T  eff     subscript  T  eff    T_{\textrm{eff}}   can then be found at a given colatitude    θ   θ   \theta   from the local effective gravity        T  eff    (  θ  )    ∼    g  eff   1  /  4     (  θ  )       similar-to     subscript  T  eff   θ      superscript   subscript  g  eff     1  4    θ     T_{\textrm{eff}}(\theta)\sim g_{\textrm{eff}}^{1/4}(\theta)   . 1 2  The theorem is named after Swedish astronomer Edvard Hugo von Zeipel .
