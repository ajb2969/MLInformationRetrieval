   Chandrasekhar number      Chandrasekhar number   The Chandrasekhar number is a dimensionless quantity used in magnetic convection to represent ratio of the Lorentz force to the viscosity . It is named after the Indian  astrophysicist  Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar .  The number's main function is as a measure of the magnetic field , being proportional to the square of a characteristic magnetic field in a system.  Definition  The Chandrasekhar number is usually denoted by the letter    Q    Q   \ Q   , and is motivated by a dimensionless form of the Navier-Stokes equation in the presence of a magnetic force in the equations of magnetohydrodynamics :           1  σ    (      ∂  𝐮    ∂  t     +    (   𝐮  ⋅  ∇   )   𝐮    )    =     -   ∇   p     +    ∇  2    𝐮    +    σ  ζ    Q    (   ∇  ∧  𝐁   )     ∧  𝐁    ,          1  σ         𝐮     t       normal-⋅  𝐮  normal-∇   𝐮            normal-∇  p      superscript  normal-∇  2   𝐮       σ  ζ   Q    normal-∇  𝐁     𝐁     \frac{1}{\sigma}\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t}\ +\ (\mathbf{u}%
 \cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}\right)\ =\ -{\mathbf{\nabla}}p\ +\ \nabla^{2}\mathbf{u}%
 \ +\frac{\sigma}{\zeta}{Q}\ ({\mathbf{\nabla}}\wedge\mathbf{B})\wedge\mathbf{B},        where    σ    σ   \ \sigma   is the Prandtl number , and    ζ    ζ   \ \zeta   is the magnetic Prandtl number.  The Chandrasekhar number is thus defined as: 1         Q   =     B  0    2    d  2      μ  0   ρ  ν  λ        Q       superscript   subscript  B  0   2    superscript  d  2       subscript  μ  0   ρ  ν  λ      {Q}\ =\ \frac{{B_{0}}^{2}d^{2}}{\mu_{0}\rho\nu\lambda}        where     μ   0     subscript  μ  0    \ \mu_{0}   is the magnetic permeability ,    ρ    ρ   \ \rho   is the density of the fluid,    ν    ν   \ \nu   is the kinematic viscosity , and    λ    λ   \ \lambda   is the magnetic diffusivity .     B   0     subscript  B  0    \ B_{0}   and    d    d   \ d   are a characteristic magnetic field and a length scale of the system respectively.  It is related to the Hartmann number ,    H    H   \ H   , by the relation:         Q   =   H  2       Q   superscript  H  2     Q\ {=}\ H^{2}        References    See also   Rayleigh number  Taylor number   "  Chandrasekhar number  Category:Magnetohydrodynamics     N.E.
