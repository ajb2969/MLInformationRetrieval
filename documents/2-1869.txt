   Mercer's theorem      Mercer's theorem   In mathematics , specifically functional analysis , Mercer's theorem is a representation of a symmetric positive-definite function on a square as a sum of a convergent sequence of product functions. This theorem, presented in , is one of the most notable results of the work of James Mercer . It is an important theoretical tool in the theory of integral equations ; it is used in the Hilbert space theory of stochastic processes , for example the Karhunen–Loève theorem ; and it is also used to characterize a symmetric positive semi-definite kernel . 1  Introduction  To explain Mercer's theorem , we first consider an important special case; see below for a more general formulation. A kernel , in this context, is a symmetric continuous function that maps      K  :     [  a  ,  b  ]   ×   [  a  ,  b  ]    →  ℝ      normal-:  K   normal-→     a  b    a  b    ℝ     K:[a,b]\times[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}     where symmetric means that K ( x , s ) = K ( s , x ).  K is said to be non-negative definite (or positive semidefinite ) if and only if        ∑   i  =  1   n     ∑   j  =  1   n    K   (   x  i   ,   x  j   )    c  i    c  j      ≥  0        superscript   subscript     i  1    n     superscript   subscript     j  1    n     K    subscript  x  i    subscript  x  j     subscript  c  i    subscript  c  j      0    \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}K(x_{i},x_{j})c_{i}c_{j}\geq 0     for all finite sequences of points x 1 , ..., x n of [ a , b ] and all choices of real numbers c 1 , ..., c n (cf. positive definite kernel ).  Associated to K is a linear operator on functions defined by the integral         [    T  K   φ   ]    (  x  )    =    ∫  a  b    K   (  x  ,  s  )   φ   (  s  )   d  s     .         delimited-[]     subscript  T  K   φ    x     superscript   subscript   a   b     K   x  s   φ  s  d  s      [T_{K}\varphi](x)=\int_{a}^{b}K(x,s)\varphi(s)\,ds.     For technical considerations we assume φ can range through the space L 2 [ a , b ] (see Lp space ) of square-integrable real-valued functions. Since T is a linear operator, we can talk about eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of T .  Theorem . Suppose K is a continuous symmetric non-negative definite kernel. Then there is an orthonormal basis { e i } i of L 2 [ a , b ] consisting of eigenfunctions of T K such that the corresponding sequence of eigenvalues {λ i } i is nonnegative. The eigenfunctions corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues are continuous on [ a , b ] and K has the representation       K   (  s  ,  t  )    =    ∑   j  =  1   ∞      λ  j     e  j    (  s  )    e  j    (  t  )           K   s  t      superscript   subscript     j  1         subscript  λ  j    subscript  e  j   s   subscript  e  j   t      K(s,t)=\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\lambda_{j}\,e_{j}(s)\,e_{j}(t)     where the convergence is absolute and uniform.  Details  We now explain in greater detail the structure of the proof of Mercer's theorem, particularly how it relates to spectral theory of compact operators .   The map K → T K is injective.    T K is a non-negative symmetric compact operator on L 2 [ a , b ]; moreover K ( x , x ) ≥ 0.   To show compactness, show that the image of the unit ball of L 2 [ a , b ] under T K  equicontinuous and apply Ascoli's theorem , to show that the image of the unit ball is relatively compact in C([ a , b ]) with the uniform norm and a fortiori in L 2 [ a , b ].  Now apply the spectral theorem for compact operators on Hilbert spaces to T K to show the existence of the orthonormal basis { e i } i of L 2 [ a , b ]         λ  i    e  i    (  t  )    =    [    T  K    e  i    ]    (  t  )    =    ∫  a  b    K   (  t  ,  s  )    e  i    (  s  )   d  s     .           subscript  λ  i    subscript  e  i   t      delimited-[]     subscript  T  K    subscript  e  i     t          superscript   subscript   a   b     K   t  s    subscript  e  i   s  d  s       \lambda_{i}e_{i}(t)=[T_{K}e_{i}](t)=\int_{a}^{b}K(t,s)e_{i}(s)\,ds.     If λ i ≠ 0, the eigenvector e i is seen to be continuous on [ a , b ]. Now         ∑   i  =  1   ∞     λ  i    |    e  i    (  t  )    e  i    (  s  )    |     ≤    sup   x  ∈   [  a  ,  b  ]       |   K   (  x  ,  x  )    |   2     ,        superscript   subscript     i  1         subscript  λ  i        subscript  e  i   t   subscript  e  i   s        subscript  supremum    x   a  b      superscript      K   x  x     2      \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\lambda_{i}|e_{i}(t)e_{i}(s)|\leq\sup_{x\in[a,b]}|K(x,x)|^{%
 2},     which shows that the sequence       ∑   i  =  1   ∞     λ  i    e  i    (  t  )    e  i    (  s  )        superscript   subscript     i  1         subscript  λ  i    subscript  e  i   t   subscript  e  i   s     \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\lambda_{i}e_{i}(t)e_{i}(s)     converges absolutely and uniformly to a kernel K 0 which is easily seen to define the same operator as the kernel K . Hence K = K 0 from which Mercer's theorem follows.  Trace  The following is immediate:  Theorem . Suppose K is a continuous symmetric non-negative definite kernel; T K has a sequence of nonnegative eigenvalues {λ i } i . Then         ∫  a  b    K   (  t  ,  t  )   d  t    =    ∑  i    λ  i     .        superscript   subscript   a   b     K   t  t   d  t      subscript   i    subscript  λ  i      \int_{a}^{b}K(t,t)\,dt=\sum_{i}\lambda_{i}.     This shows that the operator T K is a trace class operator and        trace   (   T  K   )    =    ∫  a  b    K   (  t  ,  t  )   d  t     .       trace   subscript  T  K      superscript   subscript   a   b     K   t  t   d  t      \operatorname{trace}(T_{K})=\int_{a}^{b}K(t,t)\,dt.     Generalizations  Mercer's theorem itself is a generalization of the result that any positive semidefinite matrix is the Gramian matrix of a set of vectors.  The first generalization replaces the interval [ a , b ] with any compact Hausdorff space and Lebesgue measure on [ a , b ] is replaced by a finite countably additive measure μ on the Borel algebra of X whose support is X . This means that μ( U ) > 0 for any nonempty open subset U of X .  A recent generalization replaces this conditions by that follows: the set X is a first-countable topological space endowed with a Borel (complete) measure μ. X is the support of μ and, for all x in X , there is an open set U containing x and having finite measure. Then essentially the same result holds:  Theorem . Suppose K is a continuous symmetric positive definite kernel on X . If the function κ is L 1 μ ( X ), where κ(x)=K(x,x), for all x in X , then there is an orthonormal set { e i } i of L 2 μ ( X ) consisting of eigenfunctions of T K such that corresponding sequence of eigenvalues {λ i } i is nonnegative. The eigenfunctions corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues are continuous on X and K has the representation       K   (  s  ,  t  )    =    ∑   j  =  1   ∞      λ  j     e  j    (  s  )    e  j    (  t  )           K   s  t      superscript   subscript     j  1         subscript  λ  j    subscript  e  j   s   subscript  e  j   t      K(s,t)=\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\lambda_{j}\,e_{j}(s)\,e_{j}(t)     where the convergence is absolute and uniform on compact subsets of X .  The next generalization deals with representations of measurable kernels.  Let ( X , M , μ) be a σ-finite measure space. An L 2 (or square integrable) kernel on X is a function       K  ∈    L   μ  ⊗  μ   2    (   X  ×  X   )     .      K     subscript   superscript  L  2    tensor-product  μ  μ      X  X      K\in L^{2}_{\mu\otimes\mu}(X\times X).     L 2 kernels define a bounded operator T K by the formula        ⟨    T  K   φ   ,  ψ  ⟩   =    ∫   X  ×  X     K   (  y  ,  x  )   φ   (  y  )   ψ   (  x  )   d   [   μ  ⊗  μ   ]    (  y  ,  x  )      .          subscript  T  K   φ   ψ     subscript     X  X      K   y  x   φ  y  ψ  x  d   delimited-[]   tensor-product  μ  μ     y  x       \langle T_{K}\varphi,\psi\rangle=\int_{X\times X}K(y,x)\varphi(y)\psi(x)\,d[%
 \mu\otimes\mu](y,x).     T K is a compact operator (actually it is even a Hilbert–Schmidt operator ). If the kernel K is symmetric, by the spectral theorem , T K has an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. Those eigenvectors that correspond to non-zero eigenvalues can be arranged in a sequence { e i } i (regardless of separability).  Theorem . If K is a symmetric positive definite kernel on( X , M , μ), then       K   (  y  ,  x  )    =    ∑   i  ∈  ℕ      λ  i    e  i    (  y  )    e  i    (  x  )           K   y  x      subscript     i  ℕ       subscript  λ  i    subscript  e  i   y   subscript  e  i   x      K(y,x)=\sum_{i\in\mathbb{N}}\lambda_{i}e_{i}(y)e_{i}(x)     where the convergence in the L 2 norm. Note that when continuity of the kernel is not assumed, the expansion no longer converges uniformly.
