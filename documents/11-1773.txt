Stochastic ordering

In probability theory and statistics, a stochastic order quantifies the concept of one random variable being "bigger" than another. These are usually partial orders, so that one random variable 
 
 
 
  may be neither stochastically greater than, less than nor equal to another random variable 
 
 
 
 . Many different orders exist, which have different applications.
Usual stochastic order
A real random variable 
 
 
 
  is less than a random variable 
 
 
 
  in the "usual stochastic order" if



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the probability of an event. This is sometimes denoted 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 . If additionally 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is stochastically strictly less than 
 
 
 
 , sometimes denoted 
 
 
 
 . In decision theory, under this circumstance B is said to be first-order stochastically dominant over A.
Characterizations
The following rules describe cases when one random variable is stochastically less than or equal to another. Strict version of some of these rules also exist.



 
  if and only if for all non-decreasing functions 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is non-decreasing and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 

If 
 
 
 
  is an increasing function and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are independent sets of random variables with 
 
 
 
  for each 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  and in particular 
 
 
 
  Moreover, the 
 
 
 
 th order statistics satisfy 
 
 
 
 .
If two sequences of random variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  each converge in distribution, then their limits satisfy 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are random variables such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .

Other properties
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  (the random variables are equal in distribution).
Stochastic dominance
Stochastic dominance1 is a stochastic ordering used in decision theory. Several "orders" of stochastic dominance are defined.

Zeroth order stochastic dominance consists of simple inequality
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  for all states of nature.
First order stochastic dominance is equivalent to the usual stochastic order above.
Higher order stochastic dominance is defined in terms of integrals of the distribution function.
Lower order stochastic dominance implies higher order stochastic dominance.

Multivariate stochastic order
An 
 
 
 
 -valued random variable 
 
 
 
  is less than an 
 
 
 
 -valued random variable 
 
 
 
  in the "usual stochastic order" if



Other types of multivariate stochastic orders exist. For instance the upper and lower orthant order which are similar to the usual one-dimensional stochastic order. 
 
 
 
  is said to be smaller than 
 
 
 
  in upper orthant order if



and 
 
 
 
  is smaller than 
 
 
 
  in lower orthant order if



All three order types also have integral representations, that is for a particular order 
 
 
 
  is smaller than 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in a class of functions 
 
 
 
 .2

 
  is then called generator of the respective order.
Other stochastic orders
Hazard rate order
The hazard rate of a non-negative random variable 
 
 
 
  with absolutely continuous distribution function 
 
 
 
  and density function 
 
 
 
  is defined as



Given two non-negative variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with absolutely continuous distribution 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and with hazard rate functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively, 
 
 
 
  is said to be smaller than 
 
 
 
  in the hazard rate order (denoted as 
 
 
 
 ) if


 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , or equivalently if


 
  is decreasing in 
 
 
 
 .
Likelihood ratio order
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  two continuous (or discrete) random variables with densities (or discrete densities) 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively, so that 
 
 
 
  increases in 
 
 
 
  over the union of the supports of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ; in this case, 
 
 
 
  is smaller than 
 
 
 
  in the likelihood ratio order (
 
 
 
 ).
Mean residual life order
Variability orders
If two variables have the same mean, they can still be compared by how "spread out" their distributions are. This is captured to a limited extent by the variance, but more fully by a range of stochastic orders.
Convex order
Convex order is a special kind of variability order. Under the convex ordering, 
 
 
 
  is less than 
 
 
 
  if and only if for all convex 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
Laplace transform order
Laplace transform order compares both size and variability of two random variables. Similar to convex order, Laplace transform order is established by comparing the expectation of a function of the random variable where the function is from a special class
 
 
 
 . This makes the Laplace transform order an integral stochastic order with the generator set given by the function set defined above with 
 
 
 
  a positive real number.
Realizable monotonicity
Considering a family of probability distributions 
 
 
 
  on partially ordered space 
 
 
 
  indexed with 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
  is another partially ordered space, the concept of complete or realizable monotonicity may be defined. It means, there exists a family of random variables 
 
 
 
  on the same probability space, such that the distribution of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  almost surely whenever 
 
 
 
 . It means the existence of a monotone coupling. See3
