J-multiplicity

In algebra, a j-multiplicity is a generalization of a Hilbert–Samuel multiplicity. For m-primary ideals, the two notions coincide.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a local Noetherian ring of Krull dimension

 
 . Then the j-multiplicity of an ideal I is


 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is the normalized coefficient of the degree d − 1 term in the Hilbert polynomial 
 
 
 
 ; 
 
 
 
  means the space of sections supported at 
 
 
 
 .
