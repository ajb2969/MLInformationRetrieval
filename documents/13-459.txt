   Noether inequality      Noether inequality   In mathematics , the Noether inequality , named after Max Noether , is a property of compact minimal complex surfaces that restricts the topological type of the underlying topological 4-manifold . It holds more generally for minimal projective surfaces of general type over an algebraically closed field.  Formulation of the inequality  Let X be a smooth minimal  projective  surface of general type defined over an algebraically closed field (or a smooth minimal compact complex surface of general type) with canonical divisor K = − c 1 ( X ), and let p g = h 0 ( K ) be the dimension of the space of holomorphic two forms, then       p  g   ≤     1  2    c  1     (  X  )   2    +  2.        subscript  p  g         1  2    subscript  c  1    superscript  X  2    2.     p_{g}\leq\frac{1}{2}c_{1}(X)^{2}+2.     For complex surfaces, an alternative formulation expresses this inequality in terms of topological invariants of the underlying real oriented four manifold. Since a surface of general type is a Kähler surface, the dimension of the maximal positive subspace in intersection form on the second cohomology is given by b + = 1 + 2 p g . Moreover by the Hirzebruch signature theorem  c 1 2 ( X ) = 2 e + 3 σ , where e = c 2 ( X ) is the topological Euler characteristic and σ = b + − b − is the signature of the intersection form . Therefore the Noether inequality can also be expressed as       b  +   ≤    2  e   +   3  σ   +   5         subscript  b        2  e     3  σ   5     b_{+}\leq 2e+3\sigma+5\,     or equivalently using e = 2 – 2 b 1 + b + + b -        b  -   +   4   b  1     ≤    4   b  +    +   9.           subscript  b      4   subscript  b  1         4   subscript  b     9.     b_{-}+4b_{1}\leq 4b_{+}+9.\,     Combining the Noether inequality with the Noether formula 12χ= c 1 2 + c 2 gives         5   c  1     (  X  )   2    -    c  2    (  X  )     +  36   ≥   12  q             5   subscript  c  1    superscript  X  2       subscript  c  2   X    36     12  q     5c_{1}(X)^{2}-c_{2}(X)+36\geq 12q   where q is the irregularity of a surface , which leads to a slightly weaker inequality, which is also often called the Noether inequality:         5   c  1     (  X  )   2    -    c  2    (  X  )     +  36   ≥   0   (    c  1  2    (  X  )   even   )              5   subscript  c  1    superscript  X  2       subscript  c  2   X    36    0     superscript   subscript  c  1   2   X  even      5c_{1}(X)^{2}-c_{2}(X)+36\geq 0\quad(c_{1}^{2}(X)\text{ even})             5   c  1     (  X  )   2    -    c  2    (  X  )     +  30   ≥   0   (    c  1  2    (  X  )   odd   )     .            5   subscript  c  1    superscript  X  2       subscript  c  2   X    30    0     superscript   subscript  c  1   2   X  odd      5c_{1}(X)^{2}-c_{2}(X)+30\geq 0\quad(c_{1}^{2}(X)\text{ odd}).     Surfaces where equality holds (i.e. on the Noether line) are called Horikawa surfaces .  Proof sketch  It follows from the minimal general type condition that K 2 > 0. We may thus assume that p g > 1, since the inequality is otherwise automatic. In particular, we may assume there is an effective divisor D representing K . We then have an exact sequence      0  →    H  0    (   𝒪  X   )    →    H  0    (  K  )    →    H  0    (    K  |   D   )    →    H  1    (   𝒪  X   )    →        normal-→  0     superscript  H  0    subscript  𝒪  X      normal-→       superscript  H  0   K     normal-→       superscript  H  0    evaluated-at  K  D      normal-→       superscript  H  1    subscript  𝒪  X      normal-→    absent     0\to H^{0}(\mathcal{O}_{X})\to H^{0}(K)\to H^{0}(K|_{D})\to H^{1}(\mathcal{O}_%
 {X})\to     so       p  g   -  1   ≤    h  0    (    K  |   D   )     .         subscript  p  g   1      superscript  h  0    evaluated-at  K  D      p_{g}-1\leq h^{0}(K|_{D}).     Assume that D is smooth. By the adjunction formula  D has a canonical linebundle     𝒪  D    (   2  K   )        subscript  𝒪  D     2  K     \mathcal{O}_{D}(2K)   , therefore     K  |   D     evaluated-at  K  D    K|_{D}   is a special divisor and the Clifford inequality applies, which gives          h  0    (    K  |   D   )    -  1   ≤    1  2    deg  D    (  K  )    =    1  2    K  2     .             superscript  h  0    evaluated-at  K  D    1       1  2    subscript  deg  D   K            1  2    superscript  K  2       h^{0}(K|_{D})-1\leq\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{deg}_{D}(K)=\frac{1}{2}K^{2}.\,     In general, essentially the same argument applies using a more general version of the Clifford inequality for local complete intersections with a dualising line bundle and 1-dimensional sections in the trivial line bundle. These conditions are satisfied for the curve D by the adjunction formula and the fact that D is numerically connected.  References       "  Category:Inequalities  Category:Algebraic surfaces
