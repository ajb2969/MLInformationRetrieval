   Hexadecanal dehydrogenase (acylating)      Hexadecanal dehydrogenase (acylating)   In enzymology , a hexadecanal dehydrogenase (acylating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   hexadecanal + CoA + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   hexadecanoyl-CoA + NADH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are hexadecanal , CoA , and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are hexadecanoyl-CoA , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hexadecanal:NAD+ oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating) . This enzyme is also called fatty acyl-CoA reductase .
