   Lonely runner conjecture      Lonely runner conjecture   In number theory , and especially the study of diophantine approximation , the lonely runner conjecture is a conjecture originally due to J. M. Wills in 1967. Applications of the conjecture are widespread in mathematics; they include view obstruction problems 1 and calculating the chromatic number of distance graphs and circulant graphs . 2 The conjecture was given its picturesque name by L. Goddyn in 1998. 3  The conjecture  Consider k runners on a circular track of unit length. At t = 0, all runners are at the same position and start to run; the runners' speeds are pairwise distinct. A runner is said to be lonely at time t if he is at a distance of at least 1/ k from every other runner at time t . The lonely runner conjecture states that each runner is lonely at some time.  A convenient reformulation of the problem is to assume that the runners have integer speeds, not all divisible by the same prime; the runner to be lonely has zero speed. The conjecture then states that for any set D of k − 1 positive integers with gcd 1,         ∃  t   ∈  ℝ      ∀  d   ∈  D     ||   t  d   ||   ≥   1  k      ,     formulae-sequence      t   ℝ    formulae-sequence     for-all  d   D      norm    t  d      1  k       \exists t\in\mathbb{R}\quad\forall d\in D\quad||td||\geq\frac{1}{k},     where || x || denotes the distance of real number x to the nearest integer.
