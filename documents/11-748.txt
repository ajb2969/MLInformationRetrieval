   N-acyl-D-aspartate deacylase      N-acyl-D-aspartate deacylase   In enzymology , a N-acyl-D-aspartate deacylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-acyl-D-aspartate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a carboxylate + D-aspartate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-acyl-D-aspartate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are carboxylate and D-aspartate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-acyl-D-aspartate amidohydrolase . It employs one cofactor , zinc .
