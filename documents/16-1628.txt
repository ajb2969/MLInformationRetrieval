   Bernstein–Kushnirenko theorem      Bernstein–Kushnirenko theorem   Bernstein–Kushnirenko theorem (also known as BKK theorem or Bernstein–Khovanskii–Kushnirenko theorem  1 ), proven by David Bernstein  2 and Anatoli Kushnirenko  3 in 1975, is a theorem in algebra . It claims that the number of non-zero complex solutions of a system of Laurent polynomial equations  f 1 = 0, ..., f n = 0 is equal to the mixed volume of the Newton polytopes of f 1 , ..., f n , assuming that all non-zero coefficients of f n are generic. More precise statement is as follows:  Theorem statement  Let   A   A   A   be a finite subset of    ℤ  n     superscript  ℤ  n    \mathbb{Z}^{n}   . Consider the subspace    L  A     subscript  L  A    L_{A}   of the Laurent polynomial algebra    ℂ   [   x  1   ±  1    ,  …  ,   x  n   ±  1    ]       ℂ    superscript   subscript  x  1    plus-or-minus  1    normal-…   superscript   subscript  x  n    plus-or-minus  1       \mathbb{C}[x_{1}^{\pm 1},\ldots,x_{n}^{\pm 1}]   consisting of Laurent polynomials whose exponents are in   A   A   A   . That is:        L  A   =   {  f  ∣    f   (  x  )    =    ∑   α  ∈  A      c  α    x  α      }    ,       subscript  L  A    conditional-set  f      f  x     subscript     α  A       subscript  c  α    superscript  x  α         L_{A}=\{f\mid f(x)=\sum_{\alpha\in A}c_{\alpha}x^{\alpha}\},   where     c  α   ∈  ℂ       subscript  c  α   ℂ    c_{\alpha}\in\mathbb{C}   and for each    α  =   (   a  1   ,  …  ,   a  n   )   ∈   ℤ  n         α    subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  n          superscript  ℤ  n      \alpha=(a_{1},\ldots,a_{n})\in\mathbb{Z}^{n}   we have used the shorthand notation    x  α     superscript  x  α    x^{\alpha}   to write the monomial     x  1   a  1    ⋯   x  n   a  n         superscript   subscript  x  1    subscript  a  1    normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  x  n    subscript  a  n      x_{1}^{a_{1}}\cdots x_{n}^{a_{n}}   .  Now take   n   n   n   finite subsets     A  1   ,  …  ,   A  n       subscript  A  1   normal-…   subscript  A  n     A_{1},\ldots,A_{n}   with the corresponding subspaces of Laurent polynomials     L   A  1    ,  …  ,   L   A  n        subscript  L   subscript  A  1    normal-…   subscript  L   subscript  A  n      L_{A_{1}},\ldots,L_{A_{n}}   . Consider a generic system of equations from these subspaces, that is:         f  1    (  x  )    =  …  =    f  n    (  x  )    =  0   ,           subscript  f  1   x   normal-…          subscript  f  n   x        0     f_{1}(x)=\ldots=f_{n}(x)=0,     where each    f  i     subscript  f  i    f_{i}   is a generic element in the (finite dimensional vector space)    L   A  i      subscript  L   subscript  A  i     L_{A_{i}}   .  The Bernstein–Kushnirenko theorem states that the number of solutions    x  ∈    (   ℂ  ∖  0   )   n       x   superscript    ℂ  0   n     x\in(\mathbb{C}\setminus 0)^{n}   of such a system is equal to     n  !   V   (   Δ  1   ,  …  ,   V  n   )         n   V    subscript  normal-Δ  1   normal-…   subscript  V  n      n!V(\Delta_{1},\ldots,V_{n})   , where   V   V   V   denotes the Minkowski mixed volume and for each   i   i   i   ,    Δ  i     subscript  normal-Δ  i    \Delta_{i}   is the convex hull of the finite set of points    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   . Clearly    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   is a convex lattice polytope . It can be interpreted as the Newton polytope of a generic element of generic element of the subspace    L   A  i      subscript  L   subscript  A  i     L_{A_{i}}   .  In particular, if all the sets    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   are the same    A  =   A  1   =  ⋯  =   A  n         A   subscript  A  1        normal-⋯        subscript  A  n      A=A_{1}=\cdots=A_{n}   , then the number of solutions of a generic system of Laurent polynomials from    L  A     subscript  L  A    L_{A}   is equal to     n  !   v  o  l   (  Δ  )         n   v  o  l  normal-Δ    n!vol(\Delta)   where   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   is the convex hull of   A   A   A   and vol is the usual   n   n   n   -dimensional Euclidean volume. Note that even though the volume of a lattice polytope is not necessarily an integer but it is an integer after multiplying by    n  !      n    n!   .  Trivia  Kushnirenko's name is also spelt Kouchnirenko. David Bernstein is a brother of Joseph Bernstein . Askold Khovanskii has found about 15 different proofs of this theorem. 4  References  "  Category:Theorems in algebra  Category:Theorems in geometry     * David A. Cox ; J. Little; D.
