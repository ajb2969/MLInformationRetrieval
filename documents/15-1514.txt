   S-adenozilmetionin:tRNA ribosyltransferase-isomerase      S-adenozilmetionin:tRNA ribosyltransferase-isomerase   S-adenosylmethionine:tRNA ribosyltransferase-isomerase (, QueA enzyme , queuosine biosynthesis protein QueA ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanosine ribosyltransferase (ribosyl isomerizing; L-methionine, adenine releasing) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 7-aminomethyl-7-carbaguanosine 34 in tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L- methionine + adenine + epoxyqueuosine 34 in tRNA   The reaction is a combined transfer and isomerization of the ribose moiety of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the modified guanosine base in the wobble position in tRNAs specific for Tyr, His, Asp or Asn.
