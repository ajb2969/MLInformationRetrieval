S-adenozilmetionin:tRNA ribosyltransferase-isomerase

S-adenosylmethionine:tRNA ribosyltransferase-isomerase (, QueA enzyme, queuosine biosynthesis protein QueA) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanosine ribosyltransferase (ribosyl isomerizing; L-methionine, adenine releasing).123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 7-aminomethyl-7-carbaguanosine34 in tRNA 
 
 
 
  L-methionine + adenine + epoxyqueuosine34 in tRNA
 

The reaction is a combined transfer and isomerization of the ribose moiety of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the modified guanosine base in the wobble position in tRNAs specific for Tyr, His, Asp or Asn.
