   Souček space      Souček space   In mathematics , Souček spaces are generalizations of Sobolev spaces , named after the Czech  mathematician  Jiří Souček . One of their main advantages is that they offer a way to deal with the fact that the Sobolev space W 1,1 is not a reflexive space ; since W 1,1 is not reflexive, it is not always true that a bounded sequence has a weakly convergent  subsequence , which is a desideratum in many applications.  Definition  Let Ω be a bounded domain in n -dimensional Euclidean space with smooth boundary . The Souček space  W 1, μ (Ω; R m ) is defined to be the space of all ordered pairs ( u , v ), where   u lies in the Lebesgue space  L 1 (Ω; R m );  v (thought of as the gradient of u ) is a regular  Borel measure on the closure of Ω;  there exists a sequence of functions u k in the Sobolev space W 1,1 (Ω; R m ) such that           lim   k  →  ∞     u  k    =   u  in   L  1    (  Ω  ;   𝐑  m   )          subscript    normal-→  k      subscript  u  k      u  in   superscript  L  1    normal-Ω   superscript  𝐑  m       \lim_{k\to\infty}u_{k}=u\mbox{ in }L^{1}(\Omega;\mathbf{R}^{m})         and           lim   k  →  ∞     ∇   u  k     =  v        subscript    normal-→  k      normal-∇   subscript  u  k     v    \lim_{k\to\infty}\nabla u_{k}=v         weakly-∗ in the space of all R m × n -valued regular Borel measures on the closure of Ω.   Properties   The Souček space W 1, μ (Ω; R m ) is a Banach space when equipped with the norm given by           ∥   (  u  ,  v  )   ∥   :=     ∥  u  ∥    L  1    +    ∥  v  ∥   M     ,     assign   norm   u  v       subscript   norm  u    superscript  L  1     subscript   norm  v   M      \|(u,v)\|:=\|u\|_{L^{1}}+\|v\|_{M},         i.e. the sum of the L 1 and total variation norms of the two components.
