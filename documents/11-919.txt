   Glutathione gamma-glutamylcysteinyltransferase      Glutathione gamma-glutamylcysteinyltransferase   In enzymology , a glutathione gamma-glutamylcysteinyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   glutathione + [Glu(-Cys)]n-Gly   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   Gly + [Glu(-Cys)]n + 1-Gly   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glutathione and [Glu(-Cys)]n-Gly, whereas its two products are Gly and [Glu(-Cys)]n+1-Gly.  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the aminoacyltransferases . The systematic name of this enzyme class is glutathione:poly(4-glutamyl-cysteinyl)glycine 4-glutamylcysteinyltransferase . Other names in common use include phytochelatin synthase , and gamma-glutamylcysteine dipeptidyl transpeptidase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
