   1,5-anhydro-D-fructose reductase      1,5-anhydro-D-fructose reductase   In enzymology , a 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1,5-anhydro-D-fructose + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol:NADP + oxidoreductase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
