In mathematics, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + · · ·, also written 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , or simply 
 
 
 
 , is a divergent series, meaning that its sequence of partial sums do not converge to a limit in the real numbers. The sequence 1n can be thought of as a geometric series with the common ratio 1. Unlike other geometric series with rational ratio (except −1), it neither converges in real numbers nor in 

 
 -adic numbers for some 
 
 
 
 . In the context of the extended real number line


 
  since its sequence of partial sums increases monotonically without bound.
Where the sum of  occurs in physical applications, it may sometimes be interpreted by zeta function regularization. It is the value at 
 
 
 
  of the Riemann zeta function



The two formulas given above are not valid at zero however, so one must use the analytic continuation of the Riemann zeta functions,



Using this one gets (given that 
 
 
 
 ),


 
  where the power series expansion for 
 
 
 
  about 
 
 
 
  follows because 
 
 
 
  has a simple pole of residue one there. In this sense .
Emilio Elizalde presents an anecdote on attitudes toward the series:
