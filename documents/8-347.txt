   Stable manifold theorem      Stable manifold theorem   In mathematics , especially in the study of dynamical systems and differential equations , the stable manifold theorem is an important result about the structure of the set of orbits approaching a given hyperbolic fixed point .  Stable manifold theorem  Let      f  :   U  ⊂   ℝ  n   →   ℝ  n       normal-:  f      U   superscript  ℝ  n     normal-→     superscript  ℝ  n       f:U\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}^{n}   be a smooth map with hyperbolic fixed point at p . We denote by     W  s    (  p  )        superscript  W  s   p    W^{s}(p)   the stable set and by     W  u    (  p  )        superscript  W  u   p    W^{u}(p)   the unstable set of p .  The theorem 1 2 3 states that        W  s    (  p  )        superscript  W  s   p    W^{s}(p)   is a smooth manifold and its tangent space has the same dimension as the stable space of the linearization of f at p .       W  u    (  p  )        superscript  W  u   p    W^{u}(p)   is a smooth manifold and its tangent space has the same dimension as the unstable space of the linearization of f at p .   Accordingly     W  s    (  p  )        superscript  W  s   p    W^{s}(p)   is a stable manifold and     W  u    (  p  )        superscript  W  u   p    W^{u}(p)   is an unstable manifold .
