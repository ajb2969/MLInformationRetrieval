Stable manifold theorem

In mathematics, especially in the study of dynamical systems and differential equations, the stable manifold theorem is an important result about the structure of the set of orbits approaching a given hyperbolic fixed point.
Stable manifold theorem
Let


 
  be a smooth map with hyperbolic fixed point at p. We denote by 
 
 
 
  the stable set and by 
 
 
 
  the unstable set of p.
The theorem123 states that



 
  is a smooth manifold and its tangent space has the same dimension as the stable space of the linearization of f at p.


 
  is a smooth manifold and its tangent space has the same dimension as the unstable space of the linearization of f at p.

Accordingly 
 
 
 
  is a stable manifold and 
 
 
 
  is an unstable manifold.
