   Clifton–Pohl torus      Clifton–Pohl torus   In geometry , the Clifton–Pohl torus is an example of a compact  Lorentzian manifold that is not geodesically complete . While every compact Riemannian manifold is also geodesically complete (by the Hopf–Rinow theorem ), this space shows that the same implication does not generalize to pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. 1 It is named after Yeaton H. Clifton and William F. Pohl, who described it in 1962 but did not publish their result. 2  Definition  Consider the manifold    M  =    ℝ  2   -   {  0  }        normal-M     superscript  ℝ  2    0      \mathrm{M}=\mathbb{R}^{2}-\{0\}   with the metric      g  =       d  x   ⊗  d   y   +     d  y   ⊗  d   x      x  2   +   y  2         g         tensor-product    d  x   d   y      tensor-product    d  y   d   x       superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2       g=\frac{dx\otimes dy+dy\otimes dx}{x^{2}+y^{2}}     Multiplication by any real number is an isometry of   M   M   M   , in particular including the map:       λ   (  x  ,  y  )    =   (   2  x   ,   2  y   )         λ   x  y       2  x     2  y      \lambda(x,y)=(2x,2y)     Let   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   be the subgroup of the isometry group generated by   λ   λ   \lambda   . Then   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   has a proper, discontinuous action on   M   M   M   . Hence the quotient    T  =   M  /  Γ       T    M  normal-Γ     T=M/\Gamma   , which is topologically the torus , is a Lorentz surface. 3  Geodesic incompleteness  It can be verified that the curve       σ   (  t  )    =   (   1   1  -  t    ,  0  )         σ  t      1    1  t    0     \sigma(t)=\left(\frac{1}{1-t},0\right)     is a geodesic of M that is not complete (since it is not defined at    t  =  1      t  1    t=1   ). 4 Consequently,   M   M   M   (hence also   T   T   T   ) is geodesically incomplete, despite the fact that   T   T   T   is compact. Similarly, the curve       σ   (  t  )    =   (   tan  t   ,  1  )         σ  t      t   1     \sigma(t)=(\tan t,1)     is a null geodesic that is incomplete. In fact, every null geodesic on   M   M   M   or   T   T   T   is incomplete.  References  "  Category:Lorentzian manifolds     . ↩  . ↩
