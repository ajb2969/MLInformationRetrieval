Clifton–Pohl torus

In geometry, the Clifton–Pohl torus is an example of a compact Lorentzian manifold that is not geodesically complete. While every compact Riemannian manifold is also geodesically complete (by the Hopf–Rinow theorem), this space shows that the same implication does not generalize to pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.1 It is named after Yeaton H. Clifton and William F. Pohl, who described it in 1962 but did not publish their result.2
Definition
Consider the manifold 
 
 
 
  with the metric



Multiplication by any real number is an isometry of 
 
 
 
 , in particular including the map:



Let 
 
 
 
  be the subgroup of the isometry group generated by 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  has a proper, discontinuous action on 
 
 
 
 . Hence the quotient 
 
 
 
 
 , which is topologically the torus, is a Lorentz surface.3
Geodesic incompleteness
It can be verified that the curve



is a geodesic of M that is not complete (since it is not defined at 
 
 
 
 ).4 Consequently, 
 
 
 
  (hence also 
 
 
 
 ) is geodesically incomplete, despite the fact that 
 
 
 
 
  is compact. Similarly, the curve



is a null geodesic that is incomplete. In fact, every null geodesic on 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  is incomplete.
