   Brownian dynamics      Brownian dynamics   Brownian dynamics (BD) can be used to describe the motion of molecules for example in molecular simulations or in reality. It is a simplified version of Langevin dynamics and corresponds to the limit where no average acceleration takes place. This approximation can also be described as ' overdamped ' Langevin dynamics, or as Langevin dynamics without inertia .  In Langevin dynamics , the equation of motion is       M   X  ¨    =     -    ∇  U    (  X  )     -   γ   X  ˙     +     2  γ   k  B   T    R   (  t  )           M   normal-¨  X             normal-∇  U   X      γ   normal-˙  X           2  γ   subscript  k  B   T    R  t      M\ddot{X}=-\nabla U(X)-\gamma\dot{X}+\sqrt{2\gamma k_{B}T}R(t)     where   γ   γ   \gamma   is a friction coefficient ,    U   (  X  )       U  X    U(X)   is the particle interaction potential;   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   is the gradient operator such that    -    ∇  U    (  X  )           normal-∇  U   X     -\nabla U(X)   is the force calculated from the particle interaction potentials; the dot is a time derivative such that    X  ˙     normal-˙  X    \dot{X}   is the velocity and    X  ¨     normal-¨  X    \ddot{X}   is the acceleration; T is the temperature, k B is Boltzmann's constant ; and    R   (  t  )       R  t    R(t)   is a delta-correlated stationary Gaussian process with zero-mean, satisfying       ⟨   R   (  t  )    ⟩   =  0       delimited-⟨⟩    R  t    0    \left\langle R(t)\right\rangle=0           ⟨   R   (  t  )   R   (   t  ′   )    ⟩   =   δ   (   t  -   t  ′    )     .       delimited-⟨⟩    R  t  R   superscript  t  normal-′       δ    t   superscript  t  normal-′       \left\langle R(t)R(t^{\prime})\right\rangle=\delta(t-t^{\prime}).     In Brownian dynamics, it is assumed that the mass   M   M   M   goes to zero. Thus, the    M   X  ¨    (  t  )       M   normal-¨  X   t    M\ddot{X}(t)   term is neglected, and the sum of these terms is zero.      0  =     -    ∇  U    (  X  )     -   γ   X  ˙     +     2  γ   k  B   T    R   (  t  )         0           normal-∇  U   X      γ   normal-˙  X           2  γ   subscript  k  B   T    R  t      0=-\nabla U(X)-\gamma\dot{X}+\sqrt{2\gamma k_{B}T}R(t)     Using the Einstein relation ,    D  =     k  B   T   /  γ       D       subscript  k  B   T   γ     D=k_{B}T/\gamma   , it is often convenient to write the equation as,         X  ˙    (  t  )    =    -     ∇  U    (  X  )    /  γ    +     2  D    R   (  t  )      .         normal-˙  X   t            normal-∇  U   X   γ          2  D    R  t      \dot{X}(t)=-\nabla U(X)/\gamma+\sqrt{2D}R(t).
