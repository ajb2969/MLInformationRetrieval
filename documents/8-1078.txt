Brownian dynamics

Brownian dynamics (BD) can be used to describe the motion of molecules for example in molecular simulations or in reality. It is a simplified version of Langevin dynamics and corresponds to the limit where no average acceleration takes place. This approximation can also be described as 'overdamped' Langevin dynamics, or as Langevin dynamics without inertia.
In Langevin dynamics, the equation of motion is



where 
 
 
 
  is a friction coefficient, 
 
 
 
  is the particle interaction potential; 
 
 
 
  is the gradient operator such that 
 
 
 
  is the force calculated from the particle interaction potentials; the dot is a time derivative such that 
 
 
 
  is the velocity and 
 
 
 
  is the acceleration; T is the temperature, kB is Boltzmann's constant; and 
 
 
 
  is a delta-correlated stationary Gaussian process with zero-mean, satisfying






In Brownian dynamics, it is assumed that the mass 
 
 
 
  goes to zero. Thus, the 
 
 
 
  term is neglected, and the sum of these terms is zero.



Using the Einstein relation, 
 
 
 
 , it is often convenient to write the equation as,
