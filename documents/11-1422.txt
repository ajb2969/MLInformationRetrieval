   Acylglycerol kinase      Acylglycerol kinase   In enzymology , an acylglycerol kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + acylglycerol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate   The two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and acylglycerol , whereas its two products are ADP and acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:acylglycerol 3-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include monoacylglycerol kinase , monoacylglycerol kinase (phosphorylating) , sn-2-monoacylglycerol kinase , MGK , monoglyceride kinase , and monoglyceride phosphokinase . This enzyme participates in glycerolipid metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
