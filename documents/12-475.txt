   Associated prime      Associated prime   In abstract algebra , an associated prime of a module  M over a ring  R is a type of prime ideal of R that arises as an annihilator of a (prime) submodule of M . The set of associated primes is usually denoted by     Ass  R    (  M  )       subscript  Ass  R   M    \operatorname{Ass}_{R}(M)\,   .  In commutative algebra , associated primes are linked to the Lasker-Noether primary decomposition of ideals in commutative Noetherian rings . Specifically, if an ideal J is decomposed as a finite intersection of primary ideals , the radicals of these primary ideals are prime ideals , and this set of prime ideals coincides with     Ass  R    (   R  /  J   )       subscript  Ass  R     R  J     \operatorname{Ass}_{R}(R/J)\,   . Also linked with the concept of "associated primes" of the ideal are the notions of isolated primes and embedded primes .  Definitions  A nonzero R module N is called a prime module if the annihilator      Ann  R    (  N  )    =    Ann  R    (   N  ‚Ä≤   )           subscript  Ann  R   N      subscript  Ann  R    superscript  N  normal-‚Ä≤      \mathrm{Ann}_{R}(N)=\mathrm{Ann}_{R}(N^{\prime})\,   for any nonzero submodule ''N' '' of N . For a prime module N ,     Ann  R    (  N  )        subscript  Ann  R   N    \mathrm{Ann}_{R}(N)\,   is a prime ideal in R .  An associated prime of an R module M is an ideal of the form     Ann  R    (  N  )        subscript  Ann  R   N    \mathrm{Ann}_{R}(N)\,   where N is a prime submodule of M . In commutative algebra the usual definition is different, but equivalent: if R is commutative, an associated prime P of M is a prime ideal of the form     Ann  R    (  m  )        subscript  Ann  R   m    \mathrm{Ann}_{R}(m)\,   for a nonzero element m of M or equivalently    R  /  P      R  P    R/P   is isomorphic to a submodule of M .  In a commutative ring R , minimal elements in     Ass  R    (  M  )       subscript  Ass  R   M    \operatorname{Ass}_{R}(M)   (with respect to the set-theoretic inclusion) are called isolated primes while the rest of the associated primes (i.e., those properly containing associated primes) are called embedded prime .  A module is called coprimary if xm =¬†0 for some nonzero m ‚àà M implies x n M =¬†0 for some positive integer n . A nonzero finitely generated module M over a commutative Noetherian ring is coprimary if and only if it has exactly one associated prime. A submodule N of M is called P -primary if    M  /  N      M  N    M/N   is coprimary with P . An ideal I is a P - primary ideal if and only if      Ass  R    (   R  /  I   )    =   {  P  }         subscript  Ass  R     R  I     P     \operatorname{Ass}_{R}(R/I)=\{P\}   ; thus, the notion is a generalization of a primary ideal.  Properties  Most of these properties and assertions are given in  starting on page 86.   If ''M' ‚äÜ M'', then      Ass  R    (   M  ‚Ä≤   )    ‚äÜ    Ass  R    (  M  )           subscript  Ass  R    superscript  M  normal-‚Ä≤       subscript  Ass  R   M     \mathrm{Ass}_{R}(M^{\prime})\subseteq\mathrm{Ass}_{R}(M)\,   . If in addition ''M' '' is an essential submodule of M , their associated primes coincide.  It is possible, even for a commutative local ring, that the set of associated primes of a finitely generated module is empty. However, in any ring satisfying the ascending chain condition on ideals (for example, any right or left Noetherian ring) every nonzero module has at least one associated prime.  Any uniform module has either zero or one associated primes, making uniform modules an example of coprimary modules.  For a one-sided Noetherian ring, there is a surjection from the set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable injective modules onto the spectrum     Spec   (  R  )       Spec  R    \mathrm{Spec}(R)\,   . If R is an Artinian ring , then this map becomes a bijection.  Matlis' Theorem : For a commutative Noetherian ring R , the map from the isomorphism classes of indecomposable injective modules to the spectrum is a bijection. Moreover, a complete set of representatives for those classes is given by    E   (   R  /  ùî≠   )       E    R  ùî≠     E(R/\mathfrak{p})\,   where    E   (  -  )       E     E(-)\,   denotes the injective hull and    ùî≠    ùî≠   \mathfrak{p}\,   ranges over the prime ideals of R .  For a Noetherian module  M over any ring, there are only finitely many associated primes of M .   The following properties all refer to a commutative Noetherian ring R :   Every ideal J (through primary decomposition) is expressible as a finite intersection of primary ideals. The radical of each of these ideals is a prime ideal, and these primes are exactly the elements of     Ass  R    (   R  /  J   )        subscript  Ass  R     R  J     \mathrm{Ass}_{R}(R/J)\,   . In particular, an ideal J is a primary ideal if and only if     Ass  R    (   R  /  J   )        subscript  Ass  R     R  J     \mathrm{Ass}_{R}(R/J)\,   has exactly one element.  Any prime ideal minimal with respect to containing an ideal J is in     Ass  R    (   R  /  J   )        subscript  Ass  R     R  J     \mathrm{Ass}_{R}(R/J)\,   . These primes are precisely the isolated primes.  The set theoretic union of the associated primes of M is exactly the collection of zero-divisors on M , that is, elements r for which there exists nonzero m in M with mr =0.  If M is a finitely generated module over R , then there is a finite ascending sequence of submodules         0  =   M  0   ‚äÇ   M  1   ‚äÇ  ‚ãØ  ‚äÇ   M   n  -  1    ‚äÇ   M  n   =   M         0   subscript  M  0         subscript  M  1        normal-‚ãØ        subscript  M    n  1          subscript  M  n        M     0=M_{0}\subset M_{1}\subset\cdots\subset M_{n-1}\subset M_{n}=M\,       such that each quotient M i / M i‚àí1 is isomorphic to R / P i for some prime ideals P i . Moreover every associated prime of M occurs among the set of primes P i . (In general not all the ideals P i are associated primes of M .)    Let S be a multiplicatively closed subset of R and    f  :    Spec   (    S   -  1    R   )    ‚Üí   Spec   (  R  )        normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí   Spec     superscript  S    1    R     Spec  R      f:\operatorname{Spec}(S^{-1}R)\to\operatorname{Spec}(R)   the canonical map. Then, for a module M over R ,       Ass  R    (    S   -  1    M   )    =   f   (    Ass    S   -  1    R     (    S   -  1    M   )    )    =     Ass  R    (  M  )    ‚à©   {  P  |    P  ‚à©  S   =  ‚àÖ   }            subscript  Ass  R      superscript  S    1    M      f    subscript  Ass     superscript  S    1    R       superscript  S    1    M              subscript  Ass  R   M    conditional-set  P      P  S          \operatorname{Ass}_{R}(S^{-1}M)=f(\operatorname{Ass}_{S^{-1}R}(S^{-1}M))=%
 \operatorname{Ass}_{R}(M)\cap\{P|P\cap S=\emptyset\}   . 1  For a module M over R ,     Ass   (  M  )    ‚äÜ   Supp   (  M  )          Ass  M     Supp  M     \mathrm{Ass}(M)\subseteq\mathrm{Supp}(M)   . Furthermore, the set of minimal elements of    Supp   (  M  )       Supp  M    \mathrm{Supp}(M)   coincides with the set of minimal elements of    Ass   (  M  )       Ass  M    \mathrm{Ass}(M)   . In particular, the equality holds if    Ass   (  M  )       Ass  M    \mathrm{Ass}(M)   consists of maximal ideals.  A module M over R has finite length if and only if M is finitely generated and    Ass   (  M  )       Ass  M    \mathrm{Ass}(M)   consists of maximal ideals. 2   Examples   If R is the ring of integers, then non-trivial free abelian groups and non-trivial abelian groups of prime power order are coprimary.  If R is the ring of integers and M a finite abelian group, then the associated primes of M are exactly the primes dividing the order of M .  The group of order 2 is a quotient of the integers Z (considered as a free module over itself), but its associated prime ideal (2) is not an associated prime of Z .
