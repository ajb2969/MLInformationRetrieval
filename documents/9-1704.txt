   Flow velocity      Flow velocity   In continuum mechanics the macroscopic velocity , 1 2 also flow velocity in fluid dynamics or drift velocity in electromagnetism , is a vector field which is used to mathematically describe the motion of a continuum. The length of the flow velocity vector is the flow speed and is a scalar.  Definition  The flow velocity u of a fluid is a vector field      𝐮  =   𝐮   (  𝐱  ,  t  )        𝐮    𝐮   𝐱  t      \mathbf{u}=\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t)     which gives the velocity of an element of fluid at a position    𝐱    𝐱   \mathbf{x}\,   and time    t    t   t\,   .  The flow speed q is the length of the flow velocity vector 3      q  =   ||  𝐮  ||       q   norm  𝐮     q=||\mathbf{u}||     and is a scalar field.  Uses  The flow velocity of a fluid effectively describes everything about the motion of a fluid. Many physical properties of a fluid can be expressed mathematically in terms of the flow velocity. Some common examples follow:  Steady flow  The flow of a fluid is said to be steady if   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   does not vary with time. That is if        ∂  𝐮    ∂  t    =  0.          𝐮     t    0.    \frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t}=0.     Incompressible flow  If a fluid is incompressible the divergence of   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   is zero:       ∇  ⋅  𝐮   =  0.       normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐮   0.    \nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}=0.     That is, if   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   is a solenoidal vector field .  Irrotational flow  A flow is irrotational if the curl of   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   is zero:       ∇  ×  𝐮   =  0.        normal-∇  𝐮   0.    \nabla\times\mathbf{u}=0.     That is, if   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   is an irrotational vector field .  A flow in a simply-connected domain which is irrotational can be described as a potential flow , through the use of a velocity potential     Φ  ,    normal-Φ   \Phi,   with     𝐮  =   ∇  Φ    .      𝐮   normal-∇  normal-Φ     \mathbf{u}=\nabla\Phi.   If the flow is both irrotational and incompressible, the Laplacian of the velocity potential must be zero     Δ  Φ   =  0.        normal-Δ  normal-Φ   0.    \Delta\Phi=0.     Vorticity  The vorticity ,   ω   ω   \omega   , of a flow can be defined in terms of its flow velocity by       ω  =   ∇  ×  𝐮    .      ω    normal-∇  𝐮     \omega=\nabla\times\mathbf{u}.     Thus in irrotational flow the vorticity is zero.  The velocity potential  If an irrotational flow occupies a simply-connected fluid region then there exists a scalar field    ϕ   ϕ   \phi   such that      𝐮  =   ∇  ϕ       𝐮   normal-∇  ϕ     \mathbf{u}=\nabla\mathbf{\phi}     The scalar field   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is called the velocity potential for the flow.
