   4-hydroxymandelate synthase      4-hydroxymandelate synthase   In enzymology , a 4-hydroxymandelate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-hydroxymandelate + CO 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and oxygen , whereas its two products are 4-hydroxymandelate and carbon dioxide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate:oxygen oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) . This enzyme is also called 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase II .  References     "  Category:EC 1.13.11  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
