Wilson quotient

The Wilson quotient W(p) is defined as:



If p is a prime number, the quotient is an integer by Wilson's theorem; moreover, if p is composite, the quotient is not an integer. If p divides W(p), it is called a Wilson prime. The integer values of W(p) are :

W(2)=1

W(3)=1

W(5)=5

W(7)=103

W(11)=329891

W(13)=36846277

W(17)=1230752346353

W(19)=336967037143579
