Nickel-transporting ATPase




Nickel-transporting ATPase

In enzymology, a nickel-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + H2O + Ni2+out 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + Ni2+in
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, H2O, and Ni2+, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and Ni2+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (nickel-importing).
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
