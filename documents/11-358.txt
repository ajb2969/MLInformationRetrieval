   Nickel-transporting ATPase      Nickel-transporting ATPase   In enzymology , a nickel-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O + Ni 2 +out   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + Ni 2 +in   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , H 2 O , and Ni 2+ , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and Ni 2+ .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (nickel-importing) .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
