   Joy's Law (computing)      Joy's Law (computing)   In computing , Joy's Law , first formulated by Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy in 1983, states that the peak computer speed doubles each year and thus is given by a simple function of time. Specifically,       S  =   2   Y  -  1984     ,      S   superscript  2    Y  1984      S=2^{Y-1984},   in which   S   S   S   is the peak computer speed attained during year   Y   Y   Y   , expressed in MIPS . 1  While the growth of speed, since the law was formulated, has indeed been exponential , it has proved somewhat less.  Another statement attributed to Bill Joy that is also referred to as "Joy's Law" holds that most of the smartest people work for someone else.
