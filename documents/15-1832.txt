Joy's Law (computing)

In computing, Joy's Law, first formulated by Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy in 1983, states that the peak computer speed doubles each year and thus is given by a simple function of time. Specifically,


 
  in which 
 
 
 
  is the peak computer speed attained during year 
 
 
 
 , expressed in MIPS.1
While the growth of speed, since the law was formulated, has indeed been exponential, it has proved somewhat less.
Another statement attributed to Bill Joy that is also referred to as "Joy's Law" holds that most of the smartest people work for someone else.
