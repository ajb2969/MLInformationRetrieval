Fourier–Motzkin elimination

Fourier–Motzkin elimination, also known as the FME method, is a mathematical algorithm for eliminating variables from a system of linear inequalities. It can output real solutions.
The algorithm is named after Joseph Fourier and Theodore Motzkin.
Elimination
The elimination of a set of variables, say V, from a system of relations (here linear inequalities) refers to the creation of another system of the same sort, but without the variables in V, such that both systems have the same solutions over the remaining variables.
If all variables are eliminated from a system of linear inequalities, then one obtains a system of constant inequalities. It is then trivial to decide whether the resulting system is true or false. It is true if and only if the original system has solutions. As a consequence, elimination of all variables can be used to detect whether a system of inequalities has solutions or not.
Consider a system 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  inequalities with 
 
 
 
  variables 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
  the variable to be eliminated. The linear inequalities in the system can be grouped into three classes depending on the sign (positive, negative or null) of the coefficient for 
 
 
 
 .

those inequalities that are of the form 
 
 
 
 ; denote these by 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 
 
  ranging from 1 to 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the number of such inequalities;
those inequalities that are of the form 
 
 
 
 ; denote these by 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 
 
  ranging from 1 to 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the number of such inequalities;
those inequalities in which 
 
 
 
  plays no role, grouped into a single conjunction 
 
 
 
 .

The original system is thus equivalent to


 
 .
Elimination consists in producing a system equivalent to 
 
 
 
 . Obviously, this formula is equivalent to


 
 .
The inequality


 
  is equivalent to 
 
 
 
  inequalities 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
We have therefore transformed the original system into another system where 
 
 
 
  is eliminated. Note that the output system has 
 
 
 
  inequalities. In particular, if 
 
 
 
 , then the number of output inequalities is 
 
 
 
 .
Complexity
Running an elimination step over 
 
 
 
  inequalities can result in at most 
 
 
 
  inequalities in the output, thus running 
 
 
 
  successive steps can result in at most 
 
 
 
 , a double exponential complexity. This is due to the algorithm producing many unnecessary constraints (constraints that are implied by other constraints). The number of necessary constraints grows as a single exponential.1 Unnecessary constraints may be detected using linear programming.
