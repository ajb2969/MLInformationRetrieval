   Velocity potential      Velocity potential   A velocity potential is a scalar potential used in potential flow theory. It was introduced by Joseph-Louis Lagrange in 1788. 1  It is used in continuum mechanics , when a continuum occupies a simply-connected region and is irrotational . In such a case,        ∇  ×  𝐮   =  0   ,        normal-∇  𝐮   0    \nabla\times\mathbf{u}=0,   where   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   denotes the flow velocity . As a result,   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   can be represented as the gradient of a scalar function    Φ    normal-Φ   \Phi\;   :       𝐮  =   ∇   Φ    =      ∂  Φ    ∂  x    𝐢   +     ∂  Φ    ∂  y    𝐣   +     ∂  Φ    ∂  z    𝐤     .        𝐮   normal-∇  normal-Φ                normal-Φ     x    𝐢         normal-Φ     y    𝐣         normal-Φ     z    𝐤       \mathbf{u}=\nabla\Phi\ =\frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial x}\mathbf{i}+\frac{%
 \partial\Phi}{\partial y}\mathbf{j}+\frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial z}\mathbf{k}.       Φ    normal-Φ   \Phi\;   is known as a velocity potential for   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   .  A velocity potential is not unique. If    a    a   a\;   is a constant, or a function solely of the temporal variable, then    Φ  +   a   (  t  )        normal-Φ    a  t     \Phi+a(t)\;   is also a velocity potential for    𝐮    𝐮   \mathbf{u}\;   . Conversely, if    Ψ    normal-Ψ   \Psi\;   is a velocity potential for    𝐮    𝐮   \mathbf{u}\;   then    Ψ  =   Φ  +   b        normal-Ψ    normal-Φ  b     \Psi=\Phi+b\;   for some constant, or a function solely of the temporal variable    b   (  t  )       b  t    b(t)\;   . In other words, velocity potentials are unique up to a constant, or a function solely of the temporal variable.  If a velocity potential satisfies Laplace equation , the flow is incompressible ; one can check this statement by, for instance, developing    ∇  ×   (   ∇  ×  𝐮   )       normal-∇    normal-∇  𝐮     \nabla\times(\nabla\times\mathbf{u})   and using, thanks to the Clairaut-Schwarz's theorem , the commutation between the gradient and the laplacian operators.  Unlike a stream function , a velocity potential can exist in three-dimensional flow.  Usage in acoustics  In theoretical acoustics 2 , it is often desirable to work with the acoustic wave equation of the velocity potential    Φ    normal-Φ   \Phi\;   instead of pressure    p    p   p\;   and/or particle velocity     𝐮    𝐮   \mathbf{u}\;   .         ∇  2   Φ   -    1   c  2       ∂  2   Φ    ∂   t  2       =  0          superscript  normal-∇  2   normal-Φ       1   superscript  c  2        superscript   2   normal-Φ      superscript  t  2       0    \nabla^{2}\Phi-{1\over c^{2}}{\partial^{2}\Phi\over\partial t^{2}}=0   Solving the wave equation for either    p    p   p\;   field or    𝐮    𝐮   \mathbf{u}\;   field doesn't necessarily provide a simple answer for the other field. On the other hand, when    Φ    normal-Φ   \Phi\;   is solved for, not only is    𝐮    𝐮   \mathbf{u}\;   found as given above, but    p    p   p\;   is also easily found – from the (linearised) Bernoulli equation for irrotational and unsteady flow – as      p  =   -   ρ   ∂   ∂  t    Φ        p      ρ       t    normal-Φ      p=-\rho{\partial\over\partial t}\Phi   .
