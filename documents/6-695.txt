Velocity potential

A velocity potential is a scalar potential used in potential flow theory. It was introduced by Joseph-Louis Lagrange in 1788.1
It is used in continuum mechanics, when a continuum occupies a simply-connected region and is irrotational. In such a case,


 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes the flow velocity. As a result, 
 
 
 
  can be represented as the gradient of a scalar function 
 
 
 
 :



 
  is known as a velocity potential for 
 
 
 
 .
A velocity potential is not unique. If 
 
 
 
  is a constant, or a function solely of the temporal variable, then 
 
 
 
  is also a velocity potential for 
 
 
 
 . Conversely, if 
 
 
 
  is a velocity potential for 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  for some constant, or a function solely of the temporal variable 
 
 
 
 . In other words, velocity potentials are unique up to a constant, or a function solely of the temporal variable.
If a velocity potential satisfies Laplace equation, the flow is incompressible ; one can check this statement by, for instance, developing 
 
 
 
  and using, thanks to the Clairaut-Schwarz's theorem, the commutation between the gradient and the laplacian operators.
Unlike a stream function, a velocity potential can exist in three-dimensional flow.
Usage in acoustics
In theoretical acoustics2, it is often desirable to work with the acoustic wave equation of the velocity potential 
 
 
 
  instead of pressure 
 
 
 
  and/or particle velocity

  Solving the wave equation for either 
 
 
 
  field or 
 
 
 
  field doesn't necessarily provide a simple answer for the other field. On the other hand, when 
 
 
 
  is solved for, not only is 
 
 
 
  found as given above, but 
 
 
 
  is also easily found – from the (linearised) Bernoulli equation for irrotational and unsteady flow – as
