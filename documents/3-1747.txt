   Implicit function theorem      Implicit function theorem   In multivariable calculus , the implicit function theorem , also known, especially in Italy, as Dini 's theorem , is a tool that allows relations to be converted to functions of several real variables . It does this by representing the relation as the graph of a function . There may not be a single function whose graph is the entire relation, but there may be such a function on a restriction of the domain of the relation. The implicit function theorem gives a sufficient condition to ensure that there is such a function.  The theorem states that if the equation F ( x 1 , ..., x n , y 1 , ..., y m ) = F ( x , y ) = 0 satisfies some mild conditions on its partial derivatives , then one can in principle (though not necessarily with an analytic expression ) express the m variables y i in terms of the n variables x j as y i = ''f i ''( x ), at least in some disk . Then each of these implicit functions ''f i ''( x ), 1 implied by F ( x , y ) = 0, is such that geometrically the locus defined by F ( x , y ) = 0 will coincide locally (that is in that disk) with the hypersurface given by y = f ( x ).  First example  If we define the function     f   (  x  ,  y  )    =    x  2   +   y  2          f   x  y       superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2      f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}   , then the equation f ( x , y ) = 1 cuts out the unit circle as the level set {( x , y )| f ( x , y ) = 1}. There is no way to represent the unit circle as the graph of a function of one variable y = g ( x ) because for each choice of x ∈ (−1, 1), there are two choices of y , namely    ±    1  -   x  2        plus-or-minus      1   superscript  x  2       \pm\sqrt{1-x^{2}}   .  However, it is possible to represent part of the circle as the graph of a function of one variable. If we let      g  1    (  x  )    =    1  -   x  2            subscript  g  1   x       1   superscript  x  2       g_{1}(x)=\sqrt{1-x^{2}}   for −1 y = g_1(x) provides the upper half of the circle. Similarly, if      g  2    (  x  )    =   -    1  -   x  2             subscript  g  2   x         1   superscript  x  2        g_{2}(x)=-\sqrt{1-x^{2}}   , then the graph of    y  =    g  2    (  x  )        y     subscript  g  2   x     y=g_{2}(x)   gives the lower half of the circle.  The purpose of the implicit function theorem is to tell us the existence of functions like     g  1    (  x  )        subscript  g  1   x    g_{1}(x)   and     g  2    (  x  )        subscript  g  2   x    g_{2}(x)   , even in situations where we cannot write down explicit formulas. It guarantees that     g  1    (  x  )        subscript  g  1   x    g_{1}(x)   and     g  2    (  x  )        subscript  g  2   x    g_{2}(x)   are differentiable, and it even works in situations where we do not have a formula for f ( x , y ).  Statement of the theorem  Let f : R n + m → R m be a continuously differentiable function. We think of R n + m as the Cartesian product  R n × R m , and we write a point of this product as ( x , y ) = ( x 1 , ..., x n , y 1 , ..., y m ). Starting from the given function f , our goal is to construct a function g : R n → R m whose graph ( x , g ( x )) is precisely the set of all ( x , y ) such that f ( x , y ) = 0 .  As noted above, this may not always be possible. We will therefore fix a point ( a , b ) = ( a 1 , ..., a n , b 1 , ..., b m ) which satisfies f ( a , b ) = 0, and we will ask for a g that works near the point ( a , b ). In other words, we want an open set  U of R n containing a , an open set V of R m containing b , and a function g : U → V such that the graph of g satisfies the relation f = 0 on U × V . In symbols,        {   (  𝐱  ,   g   (  𝐱  )    )   ∣   𝐱  ∈  U   }   =   {    (  𝐱  ,  𝐲  )   ∈   U  ×  V    ∣    f   (  𝐱  ,  𝐲  )    =  0   }    .       conditional-set   𝐱    g  𝐱      𝐱  U     conditional-set     𝐱  𝐲     U  V        f   𝐱  𝐲    0      \{(\mathbf{x},g(\mathbf{x}))\mid\mathbf{x}\in U\}=\{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\in
 U%
 \times V\mid f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=0\}.     To state the implicit function theorem, we need the Jacobian matrix of f , which is the matrix of the partial derivatives of f . Abbreviating ( a 1 , ..., a n , b 1 , ..., b m ) to ( a , b ), the Jacobian matrix is       (  D  f  )    (  𝐚  ,  𝐛  )   =   [         ∂   f  1     ∂   x  1       (  𝐚  ,  𝐛  )      ⋯        ∂   f  1     ∂   x  n       (  𝐚  ,  𝐛  )        ⋮    ⋱    ⋮          ∂   f  m     ∂   x  1       (  𝐚  ,  𝐛  )      ⋯        ∂   f  m     ∂   x  n       (  𝐚  ,  𝐛  )       |         ∂   f  1     ∂   y  1       (  𝐚  ,  𝐛  )      ⋯        ∂   f  1     ∂   y  m       (  𝐚  ,  𝐛  )        ⋮    ⋱    ⋮          ∂   f  m     ∂   y  1       (  𝐚  ,  𝐛  )      ⋯        ∂   f  m     ∂   y  m       (  𝐚  ,  𝐛  )       ]   =   [  X  |  Y  ]      fragments   fragments  normal-(  D  f  normal-)    fragments  normal-(  a  normal-,  b  normal-)     fragments  normal-[           subscript  f  1       subscript  x  1      𝐚  𝐛    normal-⋯         subscript  f  1       subscript  x  n      𝐚  𝐛      normal-⋮  normal-⋱  normal-⋮           subscript  f  m       subscript  x  1      𝐚  𝐛    normal-⋯         subscript  f  m       subscript  x  n      𝐚  𝐛      normal-|           subscript  f  1       subscript  y  1      𝐚  𝐛    normal-⋯         subscript  f  1       subscript  y  m      𝐚  𝐛      normal-⋮  normal-⋱  normal-⋮           subscript  f  m       subscript  y  1      𝐚  𝐛    normal-⋯         subscript  f  m       subscript  y  m      𝐚  𝐛      normal-]     fragments  normal-[  X  normal-|  Y  normal-]     (Df)(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})=\left[\begin{matrix}\frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial

 \end{matrix}\right]=[X|Y]     where X is the matrix of partial derivatives in the variables x i and Y is the matrix of partial derivatives in the variables y j . The implicit function theorem says that if Y is an invertible matrix, then there are U , V , and g as desired. Writing all the hypotheses together gives the following statement.   Let f : R n + m → R m be a continuously differentiable function, and let R n + m have coordinates ( x , y ). Fix a point ( a , b ) = ( a 1 , ..., a n , b 1 , ..., b m ) with f ( a , b ) = c , where c ∈ R m . If the matrix [(∂ f i /∂ y j )( a , b )] is invertible , then there exists an open set U containing a , an open set V containing b , and a unique continuously differentiable function g : U → V such that        {   (  𝐱  ,   g   (  𝐱  )    )   |   𝐱  ∈  U   }   =   {    (  𝐱  ,  𝐲  )   ∈   U  ×  V    |    f   (  𝐱  ,  𝐲  )    =  𝐜   }    .       conditional-set   𝐱    g  𝐱      𝐱  U     conditional-set     𝐱  𝐲     U  V        f   𝐱  𝐲    𝐜      \{(\mathbf{x},g(\mathbf{x}))|\mathbf{x}\in U\}=\{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\in U%
 \times V|f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\mathbf{c}\}.      Regularity  It can be proven that whenever we have the additional hypothesis that f is continuously differentiable up to k times inside U × V , then the same holds true for the explicit function g inside U and         ∂  g    ∂   x  j      (  x  )    =   -     (     ∂  f    ∂  y     (  x  ,   g   (  x  )    )    )    -  1      ∂  f    ∂   x  j      (  x  ,   g   (  x  )    )               g      subscript  x  j     x        superscript        f     y     x    g  x       1        f      subscript  x  j      x    g  x        \frac{\partial g}{\partial x_{j}}(x)=-\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,g(%
 x))\right)^{-1}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{j}}(x,g(x))   .  Similarly, if f is analytic inside U × V , then the same holds true for the explicit function g inside U . 2 This generalization is called the analytic implicit function theorem .  The circle example  Let us go back to the example of the unit circle . In this case n = m = 1 and     f   (  x  ,  y  )    =     x  2   +   y  2    -  1         f   x  y         superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    1     f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}-1   . The matrix of partial derivatives is just a 1 × 2 matrix, given by        (   D  f   )    (  a  ,  b  )    =   [     ∂  f    ∂  x     (  a  ,  b  )       ∂  f    ∂  y     (  a  ,  b  )    ]   =   [   2  a  2  b   ]             D  f    a  b           f     x     a  b          f     y     a  b           delimited-[]    2  a  2  b       (Df)(a,b)=\left[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(a,b)\ \ \frac{\partial f}{%
 \partial y}(a,b)\right]=[2a\ \ 2b]     Thus, here, the Y in the statement of the theorem is just the number 2 b ; the linear map defined by it is invertible iff  b ≠ 0. By the implicit function theorem we see that we can locally write the circle in the form y = g ( x ) for all points where y ≠ 0. For (±1, 0) we run into trouble, as noted before. The implicit function theorem may still be applied to these two points, but writing x as a function of y , that is,    x  =   h   (  y  )        x    h  y     x=h(y)   ; now the graph of the function will be    (   h   (  y  )    ,  y  )       h  y   y    \left(h(y),y\right)   , since where b = 0 we have a = 1 , and the conditions to locally express the function in this form are satisfied.  The implicit derivative of y with respect to x , and that of x with respect to y , can be found by totally differentiating the implicit function      x  2   +   y  2    -  1         superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    1    x^{2}+y^{2}-1   and equating to 0:         2  x  d  x   +   2  y  d  y    =  0   ,          2  x  d  x     2  y  d  y    0    2xdx+2ydy=0,     giving         d  y   /  d   x   =   -   x  /  y              d  y   d   x       x  y      dy/dx=-x/y     and          d  x   /  d   y   =   -   y  /  x     .            d  x   d   y       y  x      dx/dy=-y/x.     Application: change of coordinates  Suppose we have an m -dimensional space, parametrised by a set of coordinates    (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  m   )      subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  m     (x_{1},\ldots,x_{m})   . We can introduce a new coordinate system    (   x  1  ′   ,  …  ,   x  m  ′   )      subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   1   normal-…   subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   m     (x^{\prime}_{1},\ldots,x^{\prime}_{m})   by supplying m functions     h  1   …   h  m        subscript  h  1   normal-…   subscript  h  m     h_{1}\ldots h_{m}   . These functions allow us to calculate the new coordinates    (   x  1  ′   ,  …  ,   x  m  ′   )      subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   1   normal-…   subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   m     (x^{\prime}_{1},\ldots,x^{\prime}_{m})   of a point, given the point's old coordinates    (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  m   )      subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  m     (x_{1},\ldots,x_{m})   using      x  1  ′   =     h  1    (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  m   )    ,  …    ,    x  m  ′   =    h  m    (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  m   )        formulae-sequence     subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   1       subscript  h  1     subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  m     normal-…       subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   m      subscript  h  m     subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  m        x^{\prime}_{1}=h_{1}(x_{1},\ldots,x_{m}),\ldots,x^{\prime}_{m}=h_{m}(x_{1},%
 \ldots,x_{m})   . One might want to verify if the opposite is possible: given coordinates    (   x  1  ′   ,  …  ,   x  m  ′   )      subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   1   normal-…   subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   m     (x^{\prime}_{1},\ldots,x^{\prime}_{m})   , can we 'go back' and calculate the same point's original coordinates    (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  m   )      subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  m     (x_{1},\ldots,x_{m})   ? The implicit function theorem will provide an answer to this question. The (new and old) coordinates    (   x  1  ′   ,  …  ,   x  m  ′   ,   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  m   )      subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   1   normal-…   subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   m    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  m     (x^{\prime}_{1},\ldots,x^{\prime}_{m},x_{1},\ldots,x_{m})   are related by f = 0, with        f   (   x  1  ′   ,  …  ,   x  m  ′   ,   x  1   ,   …   x  m    )    =   (     h  1    (   x  1   ,   …   x  m    )    -   x  1  ′    ,  …  ,     h  m    (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  m   )    -   x  m  ′    )    .        f    subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   1   normal-…   subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   m    subscript  x  1     normal-…   subscript  x  m            subscript  h  1     subscript  x  1     normal-…   subscript  x  m       subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   1    normal-…       subscript  h  m     subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  m      subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   m       f(x^{\prime}_{1},\ldots,x^{\prime}_{m},x_{1},\ldots x_{m})=(h_{1}(x_{1},\ldots

 \end{matrix}\right.\right]=[-1_{m}|J].   where 1 m denotes the m × m  identity matrix , and J is the m × m matrix of partial derivatives, evaluated at ( a , b ). (In the above, these blocks were denoted by X and Y. As it happens, in this particular application of the theorem, neither matrix depends on a .) The implicit function theorem now states that we can locally express    (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  m   )      subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  m     (x_{1},\ldots,x_{m})   as a function of    (   x  1  ′   ,  …  ,   x  m  ′   )      subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   1   normal-…   subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   m     (x^{\prime}_{1},\ldots,x^{\prime}_{m})   if J is invertible. Demanding J is invertible is equivalent to det J ≠ 0, thus we see that we can go back from the primed to the unprimed coordinates if the determinant of the Jacobian J is non-zero. This statement is also known as the inverse function theorem .  Example: polar coordinates  As a simple application of the above, consider the plane, parametrised by polar coordinates ( R , θ). We can go to a new coordinate system ( cartesian coordinates ) by defining functions x ( R , θ) = R cos(θ) and y ( R , θ) = R sin(θ). This makes it possible given any point ( R , θ) to find corresponding cartesian coordinates ( x , y ). When can we go back and convert cartesian into polar coordinates? By the previous example, it is sufficient to have det J ≠ 0, with       J  =   [         ∂  x    (  R  ,  θ  )     ∂  R           ∂  x    (  R  ,  θ  )     ∂  θ             ∂  y    (  R  ,  θ  )     ∂  R           ∂  y    (  R  ,  θ  )     ∂  θ        ]   =   [      cos  θ      -   R   sin  θ          sin  θ      R   cos  θ       ]    .        J          x    R  θ      R          x    R  θ      θ            y    R  θ      R          y    R  θ      θ               θ       R    θ         θ     R    θ         J=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial x(R,\theta)}{\partial R}&\frac{\partial x(R,%
 \theta)}{\partial\theta}\\
 \frac{\partial y(R,\theta)}{\partial R}&\frac{\partial y(R,\theta)}{\partial%
 \theta}\\
 \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta&-R\sin\theta\\
 \sin\theta&R\cos\theta\end{bmatrix}.   Since det J = R , conversion back to polar coordinates is possible if R ≠ 0. So it remains to check the case R = 0. It is easy to see that in case R = 0, our coordinate transformation is not invertible: at the origin, the value of θ is not well-defined.  Generalizations  Banach space version  Based on the inverse function theorem in Banach spaces , it is possible to extend the implicit function theorem to Banach space valued mappings. 3  Let X , Y , Z be Banach spaces . Let the mapping f : X × Y → Z be continuously Fréchet differentiable . If     (   x  0   ,   y  0   )   ∈   X  ×  Y         subscript  x  0    subscript  y  0      X  Y     (x_{0},y_{0})\in X\times Y   ,     f   (   x  0   ,   y  0   )    =  0        f    subscript  x  0    subscript  y  0     0    f(x_{0},y_{0})=0   , and    y  ↦   D  f   (   x  0   ,   y  0   )    (  0  ,  y  )       maps-to  y    D  f    subscript  x  0    subscript  y  0     0  y      y\mapsto Df(x_{0},y_{0})(0,y)   is a Banach space isomorphism from Y onto Z , then there exist neighbourhoods U of x 0 and V of y 0 and a Fréchet differentiable function g : U → V such that f ( x , g ( x )) = 0 and f ( x , y ) = 0 if and only if y = g ( x ), for all     (  x  ,  y  )   ∈   U  ×  V        x  y     U  V     (x,y)\in U\times V   .  Implicit functions from non-differentiable functions  Various forms of the implicit function theorem exist for the case when the function f is not differentiable. It is standard that it holds in one dimension. 4 The following more general form was proven by Kumagai 5 based on an observation by Jittorntrum. 6  Consider a continuous function    f  :     R  n   ×   R  m    →   R  n       normal-:  f   normal-→     superscript  R  n    superscript  R  m     superscript  R  n      f:R^{n}\times R^{m}\to R^{n}   such that     f   (   x  0   ,   y  0   )    =  0        f    subscript  x  0    subscript  y  0     0    f(x_{0},y_{0})=0   . If there exist open neighbourhoods    A  ⊂   R  n       A   superscript  R  n     A\subset R^{n}   and    B  ⊂   R  m       B   superscript  R  m     B\subset R^{m}   of x 0 and y 0 , respectively, such that, for all y in B ,     f   (  ⋅  ,  y  )    :   A  →   R  n       normal-:    f   normal-⋅  y     normal-→  A   superscript  R  n      f(\cdot,y):A\to R^{n}   is locally one-to-one then there exist open neighbourhoods     A  0   ⊂   R  n        subscript  A  0    superscript  R  n     A_{0}\subset R^{n}   and     B  0   ⊂   R  m        subscript  B  0    superscript  R  m     B_{0}\subset R^{m}   of x 0 and y 0 , such that, for all    y  ∈   B  0       y   subscript  B  0     y\in B_{0}   , the equation f ( x , y ) = 0 has a unique solution      x  =   g   (  y  )    ∈   A  0         x    g  y         subscript  A  0      x=g(y)\in A_{0}   , where g is a continuous function from B 0 into A 0 .
