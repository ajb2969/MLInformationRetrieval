Pantoate—beta-alanine ligase




Pantoate—beta-alanine ligase

In enzymology, a pantoate-beta-alanine ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + (R)-pantoate + beta-alanine 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + (R)-pantothenate
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, (R)-pantoate, and beta-alanine, whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and (R)-pantothenate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds as acid-D-amino-acid ligases (peptide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-pantoate:beta-alanine ligase (AMP-forming). Other names in common use include pantothenate synthetase, pantoate activating enzyme, pantoic-activating enzyme, and D-pantoate:beta-alanine ligase (AMP-forming). This enzyme participates in beta-alanine metabolism and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis.
