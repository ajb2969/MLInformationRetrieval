   Brewer sum      Brewer sum   In mathematics , Brewer sums are finite character sum introduced by  related to Jacobsthal sums .  Definition  The Brewer sum is given by        Λ  n    (  a  )    =    ∑   x  mod  p     (       D   n  +  1     (  x  ,  a  )        p     )           subscript  normal-Λ  n   a     subscript    modulo  x  p     binomial     subscript  D    n  1     x  a    p      \Lambda_{n}(a)=\sum_{x\bmod p}{\left({{D_{n+1}(x,a)}\atop{p}}\right)}   where D n is the Dickson polynomial (or "Brewer polynomial") given by         D  0    (  x  ,  a  )    =  2   ,      D  1    (  x  ,  a  )    =  x   ,     D   n  +  1     (  x  ,  a  )    =    x   D  n    (  x  ,  a  )    -   a   D   n  -  1     (  x  ,  a  )          formulae-sequence       subscript  D  0    x  a    2    formulae-sequence       subscript  D  1    x  a    x        subscript  D    n  1     x  a        x   subscript  D  n    x  a      a   subscript  D    n  1     x  a         D_{0}(x,a)=2,\quad D_{1}(x,a)=x,\quad D_{n+1}(x,a)=xD_{n}(x,a)-aD_{n-1}(x,a)   and () is the Legendre symbol .  The Brewer sum is zero when n is coprime to q 2 −1.  References        "  Category:Number theory
