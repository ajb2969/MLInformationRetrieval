Alpha,alpha-trehalose synthase




Alpha,alpha-trehalose synthase

Alpha,alpha-trehalose synthase (, trehalose synthase, trehalose synthetase, UDP-glucose:glucose 1-glucosyltransferase, TreT, PhGT) is an enzyme with system name ADP-glucose:D-glucose 1-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ADP-glucose + D-glucose

 
  alpha,alpha-trehalose + ADP
 

This enzyme requires Mg2+ for maximal activity.
