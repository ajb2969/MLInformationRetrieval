   Kadowaki–Woods ratio      Kadowaki–Woods ratio   The Kadowaki–Woods ratio is the ratio of A , the quadratic term of the resistivity and γ 2 , the linear term of the specific heat . This ratio is found to be a constant for transition metals , and for heavy- fermion compounds, although at different values.       R  KW   =   A   γ  2         subscript  R  KW     A   superscript  γ  2      R_{\mathrm{KW}}=\frac{A}{\gamma^{2}}     In 1968 M. J. Rice pointed out 1 that the coefficient A should vary predominantly as the square of the linear electronic specific heat coefficient γ; in particular he showed that the ratio A/γ 2 is material independent for the pure 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals. Heavy-fermion compounds are characterized by very large values of A and γ. Kadowaki and Woods 2 showed that A/γ 2 is material-independent within the heavy-fermion compounds, and that it is about 25 times larger than in aforementioned transition metals.  According to the theory of electron-electron scattering 3  4  5 the ratio A/γ 2 contains indeed several non-universal factors, including the square of the strength of the effective electron-electron interaction. Since in general the interactions differ in nature from one group of materials to another, the same values of A/γ 2 are only expected within a particular group. In 2005 Hussey 6 proposed a re-scaling of A/γ 2 to account for unit cell volume, dimensionality, carrier density and multi-band effects. In 2009 Jacko, Fjaerestad, and Powell 7 demonstrated f dx (n)A/γ 2 to have the same value in transition metals, heavy fermions, organics and oxides with A varying over 10 orders of magnitude, where f dx (n) may be written in terms of the dimensionality of the system, the electron density and, in layered systems, the interlayer spacing or the interlayer hopping integral.
