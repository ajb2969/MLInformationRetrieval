   Radiant energy density      Radiant energy density   In radiometry , radiant energy density is the radiant energy per unit volume . 1 The SI unit of radiant energy density is the joule per cubic metre (J/m 3 ).  Mathematical definition  Radiant energy density , denoted w e ("e" for "energetic", to avoid confusion with photometric quantities), is defined as 2        w  e   =    ∂   Q  e     ∂  V     ,       subscript  w  normal-e        subscript  Q  normal-e      V      w_{\mathrm{e}}=\frac{\partial Q_{\mathrm{e}}}{\partial V},   where   ∂ is the partial derivative symbol;  Q e is the radiant energy;  V is the volume.   Relation to other radiometric quantities  Because radiation always transmits the energy, 3 it is useful to wonder what the speed of the transmission is. If all the radiation at given location propagates in the same direction, then the radiant flux through a unit area perpendicular to the propagation direction is given by the irradiance : 4        E  e   =   c   w  e     ,       subscript  E  normal-e     c   subscript  w  normal-e      E_{\mathrm{e}}=cw_{\mathrm{e}},   where c is the radiation propagation speed.  Contrarily if the radiation intensity is equal in all directions, like in a cavity in a thermodynamic equilibrium , then the energy transmition is best described by radiance : 5        L  e   =    c   4  π     w  e     .       subscript  L  normal-e       c    4  π     subscript  w  normal-e      L_{\mathrm{e}}=\frac{c}{4\pi}w_{\mathrm{e}}.     Radiant exitance through a small opening from such a cavity is: 6        M  e   =   π   L  e    =    c  4    w  e     .         subscript  M  normal-e     π   subscript  L  normal-e             c  4    subscript  w  normal-e       M_{\mathrm{e}}=\pi L_{\mathrm{e}}=\frac{c}{4}w_{\mathrm{e}}.   These relations can be used for example in the black-body radiation equation's derivation.  SI radiometry units  References  "  Category:Physical quantities  Category:Radiometry     ↩  Karel Rusňák.
