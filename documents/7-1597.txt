   Effective potential      Effective potential   The effective potential (also known as effective potential energy ) is a mathematical expression combining multiple (perhaps opposing) effects into a single potential. In classical mechanics it is defined as the sum of the 'opposing' centrifugal potential energy with the potential energy of a dynamical system . It is commonly used in calculating the orbits of planets (both Newtonian and relativistic ) and in semi-classical atomic calculations, and often allows problems to be reduced to fewer dimensions .  Definition  The effective potential    U  eff     subscript  U  eff    U_{\text{eff}}   is defined in the following way:        U  eff    (  𝐫  )    =     L  2    2  m   r  2     +   U   (  𝐫  )            subscript  U  eff   𝐫        superscript  L  2     2  m   superscript  r  2       U  𝐫      U_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf{r})=\frac{L^{2}}{2mr^{2}}+U(\mathbf{r})      L is the angular momentum   r is the distance between the two masses  m is the mass of the orbiting body  U(r) is the general form of the potential    The effective force, then, is the negative gradient of the effective potential:         𝐅  eff       =   -    ∇   U  eff     (  𝐫  )             =       L  2    m   r  3       𝐫  ^    -    ∇  U    (  𝐫  )             subscript  𝐅  eff     absent       normal-∇   subscript  U  eff    𝐫        missing-subexpression     absent         superscript  L  2     m   superscript  r  3      normal-^  𝐫       normal-∇  U   𝐫        \begin{aligned}\displaystyle\mathbf{F}_{\text{eff}}&\displaystyle=-\nabla U_{%
 \text{eff}}(\mathbf{r})\\
 &\displaystyle=\frac{L^{2}}{mr^{3}}\hat{\mathbf{r}}-\nabla U(\mathbf{r})\end{aligned}     Where    𝐫  ^     normal-^  𝐫    \hat{\mathbf{r}}   denotes a unit vector in the radial direction.  Important properties  There are many useful features of the effective potential:       U  eff   ≤  E       subscript  U  eff   E    U_{\text{eff}}\leq E     To find the radius of a circular orbit, we simply minimize the effective potential with respect to   r   r   r   , or equivalently set the net force to zero and then solve for    r  0     subscript  r  0    r_{0}   :        d   U  eff     d  r    =  0          d   subscript  U  eff      d  r    0    \frac{dU_{\text{eff}}}{dr}=0   After solving for    r  0     subscript  r  0    r_{0}   , plug this back into    U  eff     subscript  U  eff    U_{\text{eff}}   to find the maximum value of the effective potential    U  eff  max     superscript   subscript  U  eff   max    U_{\text{eff}}^{\text{max}}     To find the frequency of small oscillations:      ω  =     U  eff  ′′   m        ω       superscript   subscript  U  eff   ′′   m      \omega=\sqrt{\frac{U_{\text{eff}}^{\prime\prime}}{m}}   where the double prime indicates the second derivative of the effective potential with respect to   r   r   r   .  Example: gravitational potential  For example, consider a particle of mass m orbiting a much heavier object of mass M . Assuming Newtonian mechanics can be used, and the motion of the larger mass is negligible, then the conservation of energy and angular momentum give two constants E and L , with values       E  =     1  2   m   (     r  ˙   2   +    r  2     ϕ  ˙   2     )    -    G  m  M   r     ,      E        1  2   m     superscript   normal-˙  r   2      superscript  r  2    superscript   normal-˙  ϕ   2          G  m  M   r      E=\frac{1}{2}m\left(\dot{r}^{2}+r^{2}\dot{\phi}^{2}\right)-\frac{GmM}{r},         L  =   m   r  2     ϕ  ˙         L    m   superscript  r  2    normal-˙  ϕ      L=mr^{2}\dot{\phi}\,     where      r  ˙     normal-˙  r    \dot{r}   is the derivative of r with respect to time,      ϕ  ˙     normal-˙  ϕ    \dot{\phi}   is the angular velocity of mass m ,   G is the gravitational constant ,  E is the total energy, and   Only two variables are needed, since the motion occurs in a plane. Substituting the second expression into the first and rearranging gives        m    r  ˙   2    =     2  E   -    L  2    m   r  2      +    2  G  m  M   r    =    2  E   -    1   r  2     (     L  2   m   -   2  G  m  M  r    )      ,          m   superscript   normal-˙  r   2          2  E      superscript  L  2     m   superscript  r  2          2  G  m  M   r             2  E       1   superscript  r  2         superscript  L  2   m     2  G  m  M  r         m\dot{r}^{2}=2E-\frac{L^{2}}{mr^{2}}+\frac{2GmM}{r}=2E-\frac{1}{r^{2}}\left(%
 \frac{L^{2}}{m}-2GmMr\right),            1  2   m    r  ˙   2    =   E  -    U  eff    (  r  )      ,          1  2   m   superscript   normal-˙  r   2      E     subscript  U  eff   r      \frac{1}{2}m\dot{r}^{2}=E-U_{\text{eff}}(r),     where        U  eff    (  r  )    =     L  2    2  m   r  2     -    G  m  M   r           subscript  U  eff   r        superscript  L  2     2  m   superscript  r  2         G  m  M   r      U_{\text{eff}}(r)=\frac{L^{2}}{2mr^{2}}-\frac{GmM}{r}     is the effective potential. 1 As is evident from the above equation, the original two variable problem has been reduced to a one variable problem. For many applications the effective potential can be treated exactly like the potential energy of a one-dimensional system: for instance, an energy diagram using the effective potential determines turning points and locations of stable and unstable equilibria . A similar method may be used in other applications, for instance determining orbits in a general relativistic Schwarzschild metric .  Effective potentials are widely used in various fields of condensed matter, like e.g. the Gauss-core potential (Likos 2002, Baeurle 2004) and the screened Coulomb potential (Likos 2001).
