Legendre function

In mathematics, the Legendre functions Pλ, Qλ and associated Legendre functions P, Q are generalizations of Legendre polynomials to non-integer degree. 
Differential equation
Associated Legendre functions are solutions of the general Legendre equation



where the complex numbers λ and μ are called the degree and order of the associated Legendre functions, respectively. The Legendre polynomials are the associated Legendre functions of order μ=0.
This is a second order linear equation with three regular singular points (at 1, −1, and ∞). Like all such equations, it can be converted into a hypergeometric differential equation by a change of variable, and its solutions can be expressed using hypergeometric functions.
Definition
These functions may actually be defined for general complex parameters and argument:



where 
 
 
 
  is the gamma function and 
 
 
 
  is the hypergeometric function.
The second order differential equation has a second solution, 
 
 
 
 , defined as:



Integral representations
The Legendre functions can be written as contour integrals. For example (needs clarification: how is 
 
 
 
  related to 
 
 
 
 ?)


 
  where the contour circles around the points 1 and z in the positive direction and does not circle around −1. For real x, we have



Legendre function as characters
The real integral representation of 
 
 
 
  are very useful in the study of harmonic analysis on 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the double coset space of 
 
 
 
  (see Zonal spherical function). Actually the Fourier transform on 
 
 
 
  is given by


 
  where
