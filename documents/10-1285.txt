   Formate dehydrogenase (cytochrome-c-553)      Formate dehydrogenase (cytochrome-c-553)   In enzymology , a formate dehydrogenase (cytochrome-c-553) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   formate + ferricytochrome c-553   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CO 2 + ferrocytochrome c-553   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are formate and ferricytochrome c-553 , whereas its two products are CO 2 and ferrocytochrome c-553 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with a cytochrome as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is formate:ferricytochrome-c-553 oxidoreductase .  References      "  Category:EC 1.2.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
