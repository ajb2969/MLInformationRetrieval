Superconformal algebra

In theoretical physics, the superconformal algebra is a graded Lie algebra or superalgebra that combines the conformal algebra and supersymmetry. It generates the superconformal group in some cases (In two Euclidean dimensions, the Lie superalgebra does not generate any Lie supergroup.).
In two dimensions, the superconformal algebra is infinite-dimensional. In higher dimensions, there is a finite number of known examples of superconformal algebras.
Superconformal algebra in 3+1D
According to,12 the 
 
 
 
  superconformal algebra in 3+1D is given by the bosonic generators 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , the U(1) R-symmetry

 
 , the SU(N) R-symmetry 
 
 
 
  and the fermionic generators 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Here, 
 
 
 
  denote spacetime indices; 
 
 
 
  left-handed Weyl spinor indices; 
 
 
 
 
  right-handed Weyl spinor indices; and 
 
 
 
  the internal R-symmetry indices.
The Lie superbrackets of the bosonic conformal algebra are given by


























 
  where η is the Minkowski metric; while the ones for the fermionic generators are:


















The bosonic conformal generators do not carry any R-charges, as they commute with the R-symmetry generators:






But the fermionic generators do carry R-charge:
























Under bosonic conformal transformations, the fermionic generators transform as:
