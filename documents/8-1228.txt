   Delta-ring      Delta-ring   In mathematics , a nonempty collection of sets    ℛ   ℛ   \mathcal{R}   is called a δ-ring (pronounced delta-ring ) if it is closed under union , relative complementation , and countable intersection :        A  ∪  B   ∈  ℛ        A  B   ℛ    A\cup B\in\mathcal{R}   if     A  ,  B   ∈  ℛ       A  B   ℛ    A,B\in\mathcal{R}          A  -  B   ∈  ℛ        A  B   ℛ    A-B\in\mathcal{R}   if     A  ,  B   ∈  ℛ       A  B   ℛ    A,B\in\mathcal{R}           ⋂   n  =  1   ∞    A  n    ∈  ℛ        superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  A  n    ℛ    \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}\in\mathcal{R}   if     A  n   ∈  ℛ       subscript  A  n   ℛ    A_{n}\in\mathcal{R}   for all    n  ∈  ℕ      n  ℕ    n\in\mathbb{N}      If only the first two properties are satisfied, then   ℛ   ℛ   \mathcal{R}   is a ring but not a δ-ring. Every σ-ring is a δ-ring, but not every δ-ring is a σ-ring.  δ-rings can be used instead of σ-fields in the development of measure theory if one does not wish to allow sets of infinite measure.
