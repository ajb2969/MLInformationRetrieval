Delta-ring

In mathematics, a nonempty collection of sets

 
  is called a δ-ring (pronounced delta-ring) if it is closed under union, relative complementation, and countable intersection:



 
  if 
 
 



 
 
  if 
 
 



 
  if 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 


If only the first two properties are satisfied, then 
 
 
 
 
  is a ring but not a δ-ring. Every σ-ring is a δ-ring, but not every δ-ring is a σ-ring.
δ-rings can be used instead of σ-fields in the development of measure theory if one does not wish to allow sets of infinite measure.
