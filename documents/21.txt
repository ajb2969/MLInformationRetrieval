   Saddle-node bifurcation      Saddle-node bifurcation   In the mathematical area of bifurcation theory a saddle-node bifurcation , tangential bifurcation or fold bifurcation is a local bifurcation in which two fixed points (or equilibria ) of a dynamical system collide and annihilate each other. The term 'saddle-node bifurcation' is most often used in reference to continuous dynamical systems. In discrete dynamical systems, the same bifurcation is often instead called a fold bifurcation . Another name is blue skies bifurcation in reference to the sudden creation of two fixed points.  If the phase space is one-dimensional, one of the equilibrium points is unstable (the saddle), while the other is stable (the node).  Saddle-node bifurcations may be associated with hysteresis loops and catastrophes .  Normal form  A typical example of a differential equation with a saddle-node bifurcation is:         d  x    d  t    =   r  +   x  2     .          d  x     d  t      r   superscript  x  2      \frac{dx}{dt}=r+x^{2}.     Here   x   x   x   is the state variable and   r   r   r   is the bifurcation parameter.   If    r  <  0      r  0    r<0   there are two equilibrium points, a stable equilibrium point at    -    -  r            r      -\sqrt{-r}   and an unstable one at    +    -  r            r      +\sqrt{-r}   .  At    r  =  0      r  0    r=0   (the bifurcation point) there is exactly one equilibrium point. At this point the fixed point is no longer hyperbolic . In this case the fixed point is called a saddle-node fixed point.  If    r  >  0      r  0    r>0   there are no equilibrium points.   (Figure)  Saddle node bifurcation   In fact, this is a normal form of a saddle-node bifurcation. A scalar differential equation      d  x    d  t    =   f   (  r  ,  x  )            d  x     d  t      f   r  x      \tfrac{dx}{dt}=f(r,x)   which has a fixed point at    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   for    r  =  0      r  0    r=0   with       ∂  f    ∂  x     (  0  ,  0  )    =  0            f     x     0  0    0    \tfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}(0,0)=0   is locally topological equivalent to      d  x    d  t    =   r  ±   x  2            d  x     d  t     plus-or-minus  r   superscript  x  2      \frac{dx}{dt}=r\pm x^{2}   , provided it satisfies        ∂  2   f    ∂   x  2      (  0  ,  0  )    ≠  0            superscript   2   f      superscript  x  2      0  0    0    \tfrac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x^{2}}(0,0)\neq 0   and       ∂  f    ∂  r     (  0  ,  0  )    ≠  0            f     r     0  0    0    \tfrac{\partial f}{\partial r}(0,0)\neq 0   . The first condition is the nondegeneracy condition and the second condition is the transversality condition.  Example in two dimensions  An example of a saddle-node bifurcation in two-dimensions occurs in the two-dimensional dynamical system:        d  x    d  t    =   α  -   x  2            d  x     d  t      α   superscript  x  2      \frac{dx}{dt}=\alpha-x^{2}            d  y    d  t    =   -  y    .          d  y     d  t      y     \frac{dy}{dt}=-y.     As can be seen by the animation obtained by plotting phase portraits by varying the parameter   α   α   \alpha   ,   When   α   α   \alpha   is negative, there are no equilibrium points.  When    α  =  0      α  0    \alpha=0   , there is a saddle-node point.  When   α   α   \alpha   is positive, there are two equilibrium points: that is, one saddle point and one node (either an attractor or a repellor),.   A saddle-node bifurcation also occurs in the consumer equation (see transcritical bifurcation ) if the consumption term is changed from    p  x      p  x    px   to   p   p   p   , that is the consumption rate is constant and not in proportion to resource   x   x   x   .
