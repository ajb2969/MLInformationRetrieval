   Cyclamate sulfohydrolase      Cyclamate sulfohydrolase   In enzymology , a cyclamate sulfohydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cyclohexylsulfamate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cyclohexylamine + sulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cyclohexylsulfamate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are cyclohexylamine and sulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on sulfur-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cyclohexylsulfamate sulfohydrolase . Other names in common use include cyclamate sulfamatase , cyclamate sulfamidase , and cyclohexylsulfamate sulfamidase . This enzyme participates in caprolactam degradation.
