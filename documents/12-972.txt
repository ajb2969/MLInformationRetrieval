   Bertrand–Diquet–Puiseux theorem      Bertrand–Diquet–Puiseux theorem   In the mathematical study of the differential geometry of surfaces , the Bertrand–Diquet–Puiseux theorem expresses the Gaussian curvature of a surface in terms of the circumference of a geodesic circle, or the area of a geodesic disc. The theorem is named for Joseph Bertrand , Victor Puiseux , and C.F. Diquet.  Let p be a point on a smooth surface M . The geodesic circle of radius r centered at p is the set of all points whose geodesic distance from p is equal to r . Let C ( r ) denote the circumference of this circle, and A ( r ) denote the area of the disc contained within the circle. The Bertrand–Diquet–Puiseux theorem asserts that  $$K(p) = \lim_{r\to 0^+} 3\frac{2\pi r-C(r)}{\pi r^3} = \lim_{r\to 0^+}12\frac{\pi r^2-A(r)}{\pi r^4}.$$  The theorem is closely related to the Gauss–Bonnet theorem .
