   Gagliardo–Nirenberg interpolation inequality      Gagliardo–Nirenberg interpolation inequality   In mathematics , the Gagliardo–Nirenberg interpolation inequality is a result in the theory of Sobolev spaces that estimates the weak derivatives of a function. The estimates are in terms of L p norms of the function and its derivatives, and the inequality “interpolates” among various values of p and orders of differentiation, hence the name. The result is of particular importance in the theory of elliptic partial differential equations . It was proposed by Louis Nirenberg and Emilio Gagliardo.  Statement of the inequality  The inequality concerns functions u : R n → R . Fix 1 ≤ q , r ≤ ∞ and a natural number  m . Suppose also that a real number α and a natural number j are such that       1  p   =    j  n   +    (    1  r   -   m  n    )   α   +    1  -  α   q          1  p       j  n         1  r     m  n    α       1  α   q      \frac{1}{p}=\frac{j}{n}+\left(\frac{1}{r}-\frac{m}{n}\right)\alpha+\frac{1-%
 \alpha}{q}   and       j  m   ≤  α  ≤  1.          j  m   α       1.     \frac{j}{m}\leq\alpha\leq 1.   Then   every function u : R n → R that lies in L q ( R n ) with m th derivative in L r ( R n ) also has j th derivative in L p ( R n );  and, furthermore, there exists a constant C depending only on m , n , j , q , r and α such that          \| \mathrm{D}^{j} u \|_{L^{p}} \leq C \| \mathrm{D}^{m} u \|_{L^{r}}^{\alpha} \| u \|_{L^{q}}^{1 - \alpha}.  The result has two exceptional cases:   If j = 0, mr  s for some finite s > 0.  If 1 < r < ∞ and m − j − n ⁄ r is a non-negative integer, then it is necessary to assume also that α ≠ 1.   For functions u : Ω → R defined on a bounded  Lipschitz domain Ω ⊆ R n , the interpolation inequality has the same hypotheses as above and reads        ∥    D  j   u   ∥    L  p    ≤     C  1     ∥    D  m   u   ∥    L  r   α     ∥  u  ∥    L  q    1  -  α     +    C  2     ∥  u  ∥    L  s           subscript   norm     superscript  normal-D  j   u     superscript  L  p         subscript  C  1    superscript   subscript   norm     superscript  normal-D  m   u     superscript  L  r    α    superscript   subscript   norm  u    superscript  L  q      1  α        subscript  C  2    subscript   norm  u    superscript  L  s        \|\mathrm{D}^{j}u\|_{L^{p}}\leq C_{1}\|\mathrm{D}^{m}u\|_{L^{r}}^{\alpha}\|u\|%
 _{L^{q}}^{1-\alpha}+C_{2}\|u\|_{L^{s}}     where s > 0 is arbitrary; naturally, the constants C 1 and C 2 depend upon the domain Ω as well as m , n etc.  Consequences   When α = 1, the L q norm of u vanishes from the inequality, and the Gagliardo–Nirenberg interpolation inequality then implies the Sobolev embedding theorem . (Note, in particular, that r is permitted to be 1.)  Another special case of the Gagliardo–Nirenberg interpolation inequality is Ladyzhenskaya's inequality , in which m = 1, j = 0, n = 2 or 3, q and r are both 2, and p = 4.
