   Phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase      Phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase   In enzymology , a phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   phosphoenolpyruvate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyruvate + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phosphoenolpyruvate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are pyruvate and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphoenolpyruvate phosphohydrolase . This enzyme is also called PEP phosphatase .  References       "  Category:EC 3.1.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
