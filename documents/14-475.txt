   Shearer's inequality      Shearer's inequality   In information theory , Shearer's inequality states that if X 1 , ..., X d are random variables and S 1 , ..., S n are subsets of {1, 2, ..., d } such that every integer between 1 and d lies in exactly r of these subsets, then  $$H[(X_1,\dots,X_d)] \leq \frac{1}{r}\sum_{i=1}^n H[(X_j)_{j\in S_i}]$$  where $(X_{j})_{j\in S_{i}}$ is the Cartesian product of random variables $X_{j}$ with indices j in $S_{i}$ (so the dimension of this vector is equal to the size of $S_{i}$ ).
