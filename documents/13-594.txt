   Standard sea level      Standard sea level   Standard sea level (SSL) (also known as sea level standard (SLS)) defines a set of conditions for physical calculations. The term "standard sea level " is used to indicate that values of properties are to be taken to be the same as those standard at sea level, and is done to define values for use in general calculations.  Atmospheric properties  At SSL some atmospheric properties are: 1   Pressure , P = 101.325 kPa = 2116.2 lb f / ft 2 = 14.696 lb f / in 2  Density ,   ρ   ρ   \rho   = 1.225 kg/m 3 = 0.002377 slug /ft 3  Temperature , T = 288.15 K = 518.67 °R  Gas constant of air, R air = 287.057 m 2 /(s 2 ·K) = 1716.59  ft 2 /(s 2 ·°R)  Specific Weight ,   γ   γ   \gamma   = 12.014 N / m 3 = 0.07647 lb f / ft 3  Dynamic viscosity ,   μ   μ   \mu   = 1.789×10 −5  Pa·s = 3.737×10 −7 slug/(s·ft)  Acceleration of gravity at sea level, g 0 = 9.807 m/s 2 = 32.174 ft/s 2   2  See also   Mean sea level  Current sea level rise  Standard temperature and pressure   References  "  Category:Cartography     Aerodynamics, aeronautics, and flight mechanics by Barnes Warnock McCormick Edition: illustrated Published by Wiley, 1979 Original from the University of Michigan Digitized Dec 14, 2007 ISBN 0-471-03032-5, 978-0-471-03032-4 652 pages ↩  ↩
