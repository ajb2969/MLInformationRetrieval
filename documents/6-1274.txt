   Category:Subgroup properties      Category:Subgroup properties   Subgroup properties are properties of subgroups of a group. These properties are assumed to satisfy only one condition : they must be invariant up to commuting isomorphism. That is, if   G   G   G   and    G  ′     superscript  G  normal-′    G^{\prime}   are isomorphic groups, and   H   H   H   is a subgroup of   G   G   G   whose image under the isomorphism is    H  ′     superscript  H  normal-′    H^{\prime}   then   H   H   H   has the property in   G   G   G   if and only if    H  ′     superscript  H  normal-′    H^{\prime}   has the property in    G  ′     superscript  G  normal-′    G^{\prime}   .
