Category:Subgroup properties

Subgroup properties are properties of subgroups of a group. These properties are assumed to satisfy only one condition : they must be invariant up to commuting isomorphism. That is, if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are isomorphic groups, and 
 
 
 
  is a subgroup of 
 
 
 
  whose image under the isomorphism is 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  has the property in 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  has the property in 
 
 
 
 .
