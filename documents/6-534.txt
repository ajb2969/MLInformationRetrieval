Ramanujan theta function

In mathematics, particularly q-analog theory, the Ramanujan theta function generalizes the form of the Jacobi theta functions, while capturing their general properties. In particular, the Jacobi triple product takes on a particularly elegant form when written in terms of the Ramanujan theta. The function is named after Srinivasa Ramanujan.
Definition
The Ramanujan theta function is defined as



for |ab|Â f(a,b) = (-a; ab)_\infty \;(-b; ab)_\infty \;(ab;ab)_\infty.
Here, the expression 
 
 
 
  denotes the q-Pochhammer symbol. Identities that follow from this include



and



and



this last being the Euler function, which is closely related to the Dedekind eta function. The Jacobi theta function may be written in terms of the Ramanujan theta function as:



Application in String Theory
The Ramanujan theta function is used to determine the critical dimensions in Bosonic string theory, Superstring Theory and M-theory.
