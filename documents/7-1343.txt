   Force of mortality      Force of mortality   In actuarial science , force of mortality represents the instantaneous rate of mortality at a certain age measured on an annualized basis. It is identical in concept to failure rate , also called hazard function , in reliability theory .  Motivation and definition  In a life table , we consider the probability of a person dying from age x to x + 1, called q x . In the continuous case, we could also consider the conditional probability of a person who has attained age ( x ) dying between ages x and x + Δx , which is      μ   (  x  )       μ  x    \mu(x)     where F X (x) is the cumulative distribution function of the continuous age-at-death random variable , X. As Δx tends to zero, so does this probability in the continuous case. The approximate force of mortality is this probability divided by Δx . If we let Δx tend to zero, we get the function for force of mortality , denoted by      μ    (  x  )    =     F  X  ′    (  x  )     1  -    F  X    (  x  )            μ  x        subscript   superscript  F  normal-′   X   x     1     subscript  F  X   x       \mu\,(x)=\frac{F^{\prime}_{X}(x)}{1-F_{X}(x)}   :         μ    (  x  )    =     f  X    (  x  )     1  -    F  X    (  x  )      =   -     S  ′    (  x  )     S   (  x  )      =   -    d   d  x     ln   [   S   (  x  )    ]       .          μ  x        subscript  f  X   x     1     subscript  F  X   x                 superscript  S  normal-′   x     S  x                d    d  x        S  x         \mu\,(x)=\frac{f_{X}(x)}{1-F_{X}(x)}=-\frac{S^{\prime}(x)}{S(x)}=-{\frac{d}{dx%
 }}\ln[S(x)].     Since f X ( x )= F ' X ( x ) is the probability density function of X , and S ( x ) = 1 - F X ( x ) is the survival function , the force of mortality can also be expressed variously as:      μ   (  x  )       μ  x    \mu(x)     To understand conceptually how the force of mortality operates within a population, consider that the ages, x , where the probability density function f X ( x ) is zero, there is no chance of dying. Thus the force of mortality at these ages is zero.  The force of mortality      μ    (  x  )   S   (  x  )    =    f  X    (  x  )          μ  x  S  x      subscript  f  X   x     \,\mu(x)S(x)=f_{X}(x)   can be interpreted as the conditional density of failure at age x , while f ( x ) is the unconditional density of failure at age x . 1 The unconditional density of failure at age x is the product of the probability of survival to age x , and the conditional density of failure at age x , given survival to age x .  This is expressed in symbols as        μ   (  x  )    =     f  X    (  x  )     S   (  x  )      .        μ  x        subscript  f  X   x     S  x      \mu(x)=\frac{f_{X}(x)}{S(x)}.     or equivalently       ∫  x   x  +  t    -    d   d  y     ln   [   S   (  y  )    ]    d  y        superscript   subscript   x     x  t        d    d  y        S  y    d  y     \int_{x}^{x+t}-\frac{d}{dy}\ln[S(y)]\,dy     In many instances, it is also desirable to determine the survival probability function when the force of mortality is known. To do this, integrate the force of mortality over the interval x to x + t        ln   [   S   (   x  +  t   )    ]    -   ln   [   S   (  x  )    ]     ,          S    x  t         S  x      \ln[S(x+t)]-\ln[S(x)],   .  By the fundamental theorem of calculus, this is simply         S   (   x  +  t   )     S   (  x  )     =    S  x    (  t  )     .          S    x  t      S  x       subscript  S  x   t     \frac{S(x+t)}{S(x)}=S_{x}(t).     and taking the exponent to the base e results in         S  x    (  t  )    =   e   -     ∫  x   x  +  t      μ   (  y  )   d   y        .         subscript  S  x   t    superscript  e      superscript   subscript   x     x  t      μ  y  d  y        S_{x}(t)=e^{-\int_{x}^{x+t}\mu(y)\,dy\,}.     Therefore, the survival probability of an individual of age x is written in terms of the force of mortality as        μ   (  y  )    =   A  +   B   c  y        for  y   ⩾  0.      formulae-sequence      μ  y     A    B   superscript  c  y          for  y   0.     \mu(y)=A+Bc^{y}\quad\text{for }y\geqslant 0.     Examples  This example is taken from. 2 A survival model follows Makeham's law if the force of mortality is          ∫  x   x  +  t    A   +   B   c  y   d  y    =    A  t   +    B   (    c   x  +  t    -   c  x    )    /   ln   [  c  ]       .          superscript   subscript   x     x  t    A     B   superscript  c  y   d  y        A  t       B     superscript  c    x  t     superscript  c  x       c       \int_{x}^{x+t}A+Bc^{y}dy=At+B(c^{x+t}-c^{x})/\ln[c].     Using the last formula, we have        S  x    (  t  )    =   e   -   (    A  t   +    B   (    c   x  +  t    -   c  x    )    /   ln   [  c  ]      )     =    e   -   A  t      g    c  x    (    c  t   -  1   )               subscript  S  x   t    superscript  e        A  t       B     superscript  c    x  t     superscript  c  x       c               superscript  e      A  t      superscript  g     superscript  c  x      superscript  c  t   1         S_{x}(t)=e^{-(At+B(c^{x+t}-c^{x})/\ln[c])}=e^{-At}g^{c^{x}(c^{t}-1)}     Then       g  =   e   -   B  /   ln   [  c  ]        .      g   superscript  e      B    c        g=e^{-B/\ln[c]}.     where $g=e^{-B/\ln[c]}.$  See also   Failure rate  Hazard function  Actuarial present value  Actuarial science  Reliability theory   References  External links   http://www.fenews.com/fen46/topics_act_analysis/topics-act-analysis.htm   "  Category:Actuarial science  Category:Demography     R.
