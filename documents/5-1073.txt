Time consistency

Time consistency is a property in financial risk related to dynamic risk measures. The purpose of the time consistent property is to categorize the risk measures which satisfy the condition that if portfolio (A) is more risky than portfolio (B) at some time in the future, then it is guaranteed to be more risky at any time prior to that point. This is an important property since if it were not to hold then there is an event (with probability of occurring greater than 0) such that B is riskier than A at time 
 
 
 
  although it is certain that A is riskier than B at time 
 
 
 
 . As the name suggests a time inconsistent risk measure can lead to inconsistent behavior in financial risk management.
Mathematical definition
A dynamic risk measure 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 
  is time consistent if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  implies

Construction
Due to the recursive property it is simple to construct a time consistent risk measure. This is done by composing one-period measures over time. This would mean that:

Examples
Value at risk and average value at risk
Both dynamic value at risk and dynamic average value at risk are not a time consistent risk measures.
Time consistent alternative
The time consistent alternative to the dynamic average value at risk with parameter 
 
 
 
  at time t is defined by


 
  such that

Dynamic superhedging price
The dynamic superhedging price is a time consistent risk measure.6
Dynamic entropic risk
The dynamic entropic risk measure is a time consistent risk measure if the risk aversion parameter is constant.7
Continuous time
In continuous time, a time consistent coherent risk measure can be given by:


 
  for a sublinear choice of function 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes a g-expectation. If the function 
 
 
 
  is convex, then the corresponding risk measure is convex.8
