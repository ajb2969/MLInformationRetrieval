   Acyclic orientation      Acyclic orientation   In graph theory , an acyclic orientation of an undirected graph is an assignment of a direction to each edge (an orientation ) that does not form any directed cycle and therefore makes it into a directed acyclic graph . Every graph has an acyclic orientation; all acyclic orientations may be obtained by placing the vertices into a sequence, and then directing each edge from the earlier of its endpoints in the sequence to the later endpoint.  The Gallai–Hasse–Roy–Vitaver theorem states that a graph has an acyclic orientation in which the longest path has k vertices if and only if it can be colored with k colors. 1  For planar graphs , acyclic orientations are dual to totally cyclic orientations , orientations in which each edge belongs to a directed cycle: if   G   G   G   is a planar graph , and orientations of   G   G   G   are transferred to orientations of the planar dual graph of   G   G   G   by turning each edge 90 degrees clockwise, then a totally cyclic orientation of   G   G   G   corresponds in this way to an acyclic orientation of the dual graph and vice versa. 2 This duality extends to nonplanar graphs as well, via the Tutte polynomial     T  G     subscript  T  G    T_{G}   of a graph   G   G   G   , which can be used to count both types of orientations: the number of acyclic orientations of   G   G   G   is     T  G    (  2  ,  0  )        subscript  T  G    2  0     T_{G}(2,0)   and the number of totally cyclic orientations is     T  G    (  0  ,  2  )        subscript  T  G    0  2     T_{G}(0,2)   . 3 The number of acyclic orientations may also be counted using a different polynomial, the chromatic polynomial     χ  G     subscript  χ  G    \chi_{G}   : there are    |    χ  G    (   -  1   )    |         subscript  χ  G     1      |\chi_{G}(-1)|   different acyclic orientations. 4 The set of all acyclic orientations of a given graph may be given the structure of a partial cube , in which two acyclic orientations are adjacent whenever they differ in the direction of a single edge. 5  An acyclic orientation of a complete graph is called a transitive tournament , and is equivalent to a total ordering of the graph's vertices. In such an orientation there is in particular exactly one source and exactly one sink; more generally, an acyclic orientation with a unique source and a unique sink is called a bipolar orientation . 6  References  "  Category:Graph theory objects     . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩
