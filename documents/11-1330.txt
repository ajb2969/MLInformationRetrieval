N-acylsphingosine galactosyltransferase




N-acylsphingosine galactosyltransferase

In enzymology, a N-acylsphingosine galactosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-galactose + N-acylsphingosine 
 
 
 
  UDP + D-galactosylceramide
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-galactose and N-acylsphingosine, whereas its two products are UDP and D-galactosylceramide.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-galactose:N-acylsphingosine D-galactosyltransferase. Other names in common use include UDP galactose-N-acylsphingosine galactosyltransferase, and uridine diphosphogalactose-acylsphingosine galactosyltransferase. This enzyme participates in sphingolipid metabolism.
