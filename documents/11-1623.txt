   Thiamine diphosphokinase      Thiamine diphosphokinase   In enzymology , a thiamine diphosphokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + thiamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + thiamine diphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and thiamine , whereas its two products are AMP and thiamine diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring two phosphorus-containing groups ( diphosphotransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:thiamine diphosphotransferase . Other names in common use include thiamin kinase , thiamine pyrophosphokinase , ATP:thiamin pyrophosphotransferase , thiamin pyrophosphokinase , thiamin pyrophosphotransferase , thiaminokinase , thiamin:ATP pyrophosphotransferase , and TPTase . This enzyme participates in thiamine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
