2-hydroxypropyl-CoM lyase

2-hydroxypropyl-CoM lyase (, epoxyalkane:coenzyme M transferase, epoxyalkane:CoM transferase, epoxyalkane:2-mercaptoethanesulfonate transferase, coenzyme M-epoxyalkane ligase, epoxyalkyl:CoM transferase, epoxypropane:coenzyme M transferase, epoxypropyl:CoM transferase, EaCoMT, 2-hydroxypropyl-CoM:2-mercaptoethanesulfonate lyase (epoxyalkane-ring-forming), (R)-2-hydroxypropyl-CoM 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate lyase (cyclizing, (R)-1,2-epoxypropane-forming)) is an enzyme with system name (R)-(or (S)-)2-hydroxypropyl-CoM:2-mercaptoethanesulfonate lyase (epoxyalkane-ring-forming).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) (R)-2-hydroxypropyl-CoM 
 
 
 
  (R)-1,2-epoxypropane + HS-CoM
 
(2) (S)-2-hydroxypropyl-CoM 
 
 
 
  (S)-1,2-epoxypropane + HS-CoM
 

This enzyme requires zinc.
