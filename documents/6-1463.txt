   Formula game      Formula game   A formula game is an artificial game represented by a fully quantified Boolean formula . Players' turns alternate and the space of possible moves is denoted by bound variables . If a variable is universally quantified , the formula following it has the same truth value as the formula beginning with the universal quantifier regardless of the move taken. If a variable is existentially quantified , the formula following it has the same truth value as the formula beginning with the existential quantifier for at least one move available at the turn. Turns alternate, and a player loses if he cannot move at his turn. In computational complexity theory, the language FORMULA-GAME is defined as all formulas   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   such that Player 1 has a winning strategy in the game represented by   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   . FORMULA-GAME is PSPACE-complete .  References   Sipser, Michael. (2006). Introduction to the Theory of Computation . Boston: Thomson Course Technology.
