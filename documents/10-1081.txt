Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase

In enzymology, a kynurenine 3-monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-kynurenine + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine + NADP+ + H2O
 

The 4 substrates of this enzyme are L-kynurenine, NADPH, H+, and O2, whereas its 3 products are 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine, NADP+, and H2O. Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase is the expression product of the KMO (gene).
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, to be specific, those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-kynurenine,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include kynurenine 3-hydroxylase, kynurenine hydroxylase, and L-kynurenine-3-hydroxylase. This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism. It employs one cofactor, FAD.
Kynurenine-3-monooxygenase deficiency
Downregulation of kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) can be caused by genetic polymorphisms, cytokines, or both.12 KMO deficiency leads to an accumulation of kynurenine and to a shift within the tryptophan metabolic pathway towards kynurenine acid and anthranilic acid.3 Kynurenine-3-monooxygenase deficiency is associated with disorders of the brain (e.g. schizophrenia, tic disorders) and of the liver.45678
