   Blum–Micali algorithm      Blum–Micali algorithm   The Blum–Micali algorithm is a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator . The algorithm gets its security from the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms . 1  Let   p   p   p   be an odd prime, and let   g   g   g   be a primitive root modulo   p   p   p   . Let    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   be a seed, and let       x   i  +  1    =     g   x  i     mod  p        subscript  x    i  1     modulo   superscript  g   subscript  x  i    p     x_{i+1}=g^{x_{i}}\ \bmod{\ p}   .  The   i   i   i   th output of the algorithm is 1 if     x  i   <    p  -  1   2        subscript  x  i       p  1   2     x_{i}<\frac{p-1}{2}   . Otherwise the output is 0. This is equivalent to using one bit of    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   as your random number. It has been shown that    n  -  c  -  1      n  c  1    n-c-1   bits of    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   can be used if solving the discrete log problem is infeasible even for exponents with as few as   c   c   c   bits. 2  In order for this generator to be secure, the prime number   p   p   p   needs to be large enough so that computing discrete logarithms modulo   p   p   p   is infeasible. 3 To be more precise, any method that predicts the numbers generated will lead to an algorithm that solves the discrete logarithm problem for that prime. 4  There is a paper discussing possible examples of the quantum permanent compromise attack to the Blum-Micali construction. This attacks illustrate how a previous attack to the Blum-Micali generator can be extended to the whole Blum-Micali construction, including the Blum Blum Shub and Kaliski generators. 5  References  External links   http://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/crypto/blummicali.xhtml   "  Category:Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators     Bruce Schneier, Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C , pages 416-417, Wiley; 2nd edition (October 18, 1996), ISBN 0471117099 ↩  An improved pseudo-random generator based on the discrete logarithm problem R Gennaro - Journal of Cryptology, 2005 - Springer ↩   Manuel Blum and Silvio Micali, How to Generate Cryptographically Strong Sequences of Pseudorandom Bits, SIAM Journal on Computing 13, no. 4 (1984): 850-864. online (pdf) ↩  Elloá B.
