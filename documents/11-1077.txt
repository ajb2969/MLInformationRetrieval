   D-amino-acid transaminase      D-amino-acid transaminase   In enzymology , a D-amino-acid transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :   D-alanine + 2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyruvate + D-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-alanine and 2-oxoglutarate , whereas its two products are pyruvate and D-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-alanine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include D-aspartate transaminase , D-alanine aminotransferase , D-aspartic aminotransferase , D-alanine-D-glutamate transaminase , D-alanine transaminase , and D-amino acid aminotransferase . This enzyme participates in 6 metabolic pathways : lysine degradation , arginine and proline metabolism , phenylalanine metabolism , d-arginine and d-ornithine metabolism , d-alanine metabolism , and peptidoglycan biosynthesis . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 8 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , and .
