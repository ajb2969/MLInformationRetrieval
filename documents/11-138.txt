UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide—D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase




UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide—D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase

In enzymology, an UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide—D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-gamma-D-glutamyl-L-lysine + D-alanyl-D-alanine 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-gamma-D-glutamyl-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D- alanine
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-gamma-D-glutamyl-L-lysine, and D-alanyl-D-alanine, whereas its 4 products are ADP, phosphate, UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-gamma-D-glutamyl-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-, and alanine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds as acid-D-amino-acid ligases (peptide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-L-lysine:D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase (ADP-forming). Other names in common use include MurF synthetase, UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine, synthetase, UDP-N-acetylmuramoylalanyl-D-glutamyl-lysine-D-alanyl-D-alanine, ligase, uridine diphosphoacetylmuramoylpentapeptide synthetase, UDPacetylmuramoylpentapeptide synthetase, and UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu-L-Lys:D-Ala-D-Ala ligase. This enzyme participates in lysine biosynthesis and peptidoglycan biosynthesis.
