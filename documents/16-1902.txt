   Polynomial decomposition      Polynomial decomposition   In mathematics, a polynomial decomposition expresses a polynomial  f as the functional composition     g  ∘  h      g  h    g\circ h   of polynomials g and h , where g and h have degree greater than 1. 1  Algorithms are known for decomposing polynomials in polynomial time.  Polynomials which are decomposable in this way are composite polynomials ; those which are not are prime or indecomposable polynomials 2 (not to be confused with irreducible polynomials , which cannot be factored into products of polynomials ).  Examples  In the simplest case, one of the polynomials is a monomial . For example,      f  =     x  6   -   3   x  3     +  1       f       superscript  x  6     3   superscript  x  3     1     f=x^{6}-3x^{3}+1     decomposes into      g  =     x  2   -   3  x    +  1       g       superscript  x  2     3  x    1     g=x^{2}-3x+1   and    h  =   x  3       h   superscript  x  3     h=x^{3}     since       f   (  x  )    =    (   g  ∘  h   )    (  x  )    =   g   (   h   (  x  )    )    =   g   (   x  3   )    =      (   x  3   )   2   -   3   (   x  3   )     +  1.           f  x       g  h   x          g    h  x           g   superscript  x  3              superscript   superscript  x  3   2     3   superscript  x  3     1.      f(x)=(g\circ h)(x)=g(h(x))=g(x^{3})=(x^{3})^{2}-3(x^{3})+1.     Less trivially,            x  6   -   6   x  5     +   21   x  4     -   44   x  3     +   68   x  2     -   64  x    +  41                 superscript  x  6     6   superscript  x  5       21   superscript  x  4       44   superscript  x  3       68   superscript  x  2       64  x    41    \displaystyle x^{6}-6x^{5}+21x^{4}-44x^{3}+68x^{2}-64x+41     Uniqueness  A polynomial may have distinct decompositions into indecomposable polynomials where    f  =    g  1   ∘   g  2   ∘  ⋯  ∘   g  m    =    h  1   ∘   h  2   ∘  ⋯  ∘   h  n          f     subscript  g  1    subscript  g  2   normal-⋯   subscript  g  m            subscript  h  1    subscript  h  2   normal-⋯   subscript  h  n       f=g_{1}\circ g_{2}\circ\cdots\circ g_{m}=h_{1}\circ h_{2}\circ\cdots\circ h_{n}   where     g  i   ≠   h  i        subscript  g  i    subscript  h  i     g_{i}\neq h_{i}   for some   i   i   i   . The restriction in the definition to polynomials of degree greater than one excludes the infinitely many decompositions possible with linear polynomials.  Joseph Ritt proved that    m  =  n      m  n    m=n   , and the degrees of the components are the same, but possibly in different order; this is Ritt's polynomial decomposition theorem . 3 4 For example,      x  2   ∘   x  3    =    x  3   ∘   x  2           superscript  x  2    superscript  x  3       superscript  x  3    superscript  x  2      x^{2}\circ x^{3}=x^{3}\circ x^{2}   .  Applications  A polynomial decomposition may enable more efficient evaluation of the polynomial.  A polynomial decomposition enables calculation of symbolic roots using radicals , even for some irreducible polynomials . This technique is used in many computer algebra systems . 5 For example, using the decomposition           x  6   -   6   x  5     +   15   x  4     -   20   x  3     +   15   x  2     -   6  x   -  1               superscript  x  6     6   superscript  x  5       15   superscript  x  4       20   superscript  x  3       15   superscript  x  2       6  x   1    \displaystyle x^{6}-6x^{5}+15x^{4}-20x^{3}+15x^{2}-6x-1   ,  the roots of this irreducible polynomial can be calculated as       1  ±   2   1  /  6     ,   1  ±      -  1   ±    3   i      2   1  /  3          plus-or-minus  1   superscript  2    1  6      plus-or-minus  1       plus-or-minus    1       3   i      superscript  2    1  3        1\pm 2^{1/6},1\pm\frac{\sqrt{-1\pm\sqrt{3}i}}{2^{1/3}}   . 6  Even in the case of quartic polynomials , where there is an explicit formula for the roots, solving using the decomposition often gives a simpler form. For example, the decomposition          x  4   -   8   x  3     +   18   x  2     -   8  x    +  2             superscript  x  4     8   superscript  x  3       18   superscript  x  2       8  x    2    \displaystyle x^{4}-8x^{3}+18x^{2}-8x+2     gives the roots      2  ±    3  ±  i       plus-or-minus  2     plus-or-minus  3  i      2\pm\sqrt{3\pm i}    7  but straightforward application of the quartic formula gives difficult-to-simplify and difficult-to-understand solutions like        -       9    (     8   10   i    3   3  /  2     +  72   )    2  /  3     +   36    (     8   10   i    3   3  /  2     +  72   )    1  /  3     +  156     (     8   10   i    3   3  /  2     +  72   )    1  /  3      6    -       -    (     8   10   i    3   3  /  2     +  72   )    1  /  3     -   52   3    (     8   10   i    3   3  /  2     +  72   )    1  /  3       +  8    2    +  2                    9   superscript        8    10   i    superscript  3    3  2     72     2  3       36   superscript        8    10   i    superscript  3    3  2     72     1  3     156    superscript        8    10   i    superscript  3    3  2     72     1  3      6               superscript        8    10   i    superscript  3    3  2     72     1  3       52    3   superscript        8    10   i    superscript  3    3  2     72     1  3       8    2    2    -{{\sqrt{{{9\left({{8\sqrt{10}i}\over{3^{{{3}/{2}}}}}+72\right)^{{{2}/{3}}}+36%

Algorithms  The first algorithm for polynomial decomposition was published in 1985, 8 though it had been discovered in 1976 9 and implemented in the Macsyma  computer algebra system . 10 That algorithm took worst-case exponential time but worked independently of the characteristic of the underlying field .  More recent algorithms ran in polynomial time but with restrictions on the characteristic. 11  The most recent algorithm calculates a decomposition in polynomial time and without restrictions on the characteristic. 12  Notes    References   Joel S.
