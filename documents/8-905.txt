   Log area ratio      Log area ratio   Log area ratios ( LAR ) can be used to represent reflection coefficients (another form for linear prediction coefficients ) for transmission over a channel. While not as efficient as line spectral pairs (LSPs), log area ratios are much simpler to compute. Let    r  k     subscript  r  k    r_{k}   be the k th reflection coefficient of a filter, the k th LAR is:       A  k   =   log    1  +   r  k     1  -   r  k           subscript  A  k         1   subscript  r  k      1   subscript  r  k        A_{k}=\log{1+r_{k}\over 1-r_{k}}     Use of Log Area Ratios have now been mostly replaced by Line Spectral Pairs, but older codecs, such as GSM-FR use LARs.
