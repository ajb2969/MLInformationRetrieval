   Location parameter      Location parameter   In statistics , a location family is a class of probability distributions that is parametrized by a scalar- or vector-valued parameter    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   , which determines the "location" or shift of the distribution. Formally, this means that the probability density functions or probability mass functions in this class have the form         f   x  0     (  x  )    =   f   (   x  -   x  0    )     .         subscript  f   subscript  x  0    x     f    x   subscript  x  0       f_{x_{0}}(x)=f(x-x_{0}).   Here,    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   is called the location parameter . Examples of location parameters include the mean , the median , and the mode .  Thus in the one-dimensional case if    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   is increased, the probability density or mass function shifts rigidly to the right, maintaining its exact shape.  A location parameter can also be found in families having more than one parameter, such as location-scale families . In this case, the probability density function or probability mass function will be a special case of the more general form        f    x  0   ,  θ     (  x  )    =    f  θ    (   x  -   x  0    )           subscript  f    subscript  x  0   θ    x      subscript  f  θ     x   subscript  x  0       f_{x_{0},\theta}(x)=f_{\theta}(x-x_{0})   where    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   is the location parameter, θ represents additional parameters, and    f  θ     subscript  f  θ    f_{\theta}   is a function parametrized on the additional parameters.  Additive noise  An alternative way of thinking of location families is through the concept of additive noise . If    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   is a constant and W is random noise with probability density      f  W    (  w  )    ,       subscript  f  W   w    f_{W}(w),   then    X  =    x  0   +  W       X     subscript  x  0   W     X=x_{0}+W   has probability density      f   x  0     (  x  )    =    f  W    (   x  -   x  0    )           subscript  f   subscript  x  0    x      subscript  f  W     x   subscript  x  0       f_{x_{0}}(x)=f_{W}(x-x_{0})   and its distribution is therefore part of a location family.
