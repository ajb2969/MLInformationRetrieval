Hilbert projection theorem

In mathematics, the Hilbert projection theorem is a famous result of convex analysis that says that for every point 
 
 
 
  in a Hilbert space

 
  and every nonempty closed convex 
 
 
 
 , there exists a unique point 
 
 
 
  for which 
 
 
 
  is minimized over 
 
 
 
 .
This is, in particular, true for any closed subspace 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 . In that case, a necessary and sufficient condition for 
 
 
 
  is that the vector 
 
 
 
  be orthogonal to 
 
 
 
 .
Proof
:* ''Let us show the existence of y:'' Let δ be the distance between x and C, (yn) a sequence in C such that the distance squared between x and yn is below or equal to δ2 + 1/n. Let n and m be two integers, then the following equalities are true:



and



We have therefore:



By giving an upper bound to the first two terms of the equality and by noticing that the middle of yn and ym belong to C and has therefore a distance greater than or equal to δ from x, one gets :



The last inequality proves that (yn) is a Cauchy sequence. Since C is complete, the sequence is therefore convergent to a point y in C, whose distance from x is minimal.
:* ''Let us show the uniqueness of y :'' Let y1 and y2 be two minimizers. Then:



Since 
 
 
 
  belongs to C, we have 
 
 
 
  and therefore



Hence 
 
 
 
 , which proves uniqueness.
:* Let us show the equivalent condition on y when C = M is a closed subspace.
The condition is sufficient: Let 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  which proves that 
 
 
 
  is a minimizer.
The condition is necessary: Let 
 
 
 
  be the minimizer. Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .



is always non-negative. Therefore,
