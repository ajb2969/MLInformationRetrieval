<h1>Measurable cardinal</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, a <strong>measurable cardinal</strong> is a certain kind of <a href="large_cardinal" title="wikilink">large cardinal</a> number.</p>
<h2 id="measurable">Measurable</h2>

<p>Formally, a measurable cardinal is an uncountable <a href="cardinal_number" title="wikilink">cardinal number</a> Œ∫ such that there exists a Œ∫-additive, non-trivial, 0-1-valued <a href="measure_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">measure</a> on the <a href="power_set" title="wikilink">power set</a> of Œ∫. (Here the term <em>Œ∫-additive</em> means that, for any sequence <em>A</em><sub>Œ±</sub>, Œ±&lt;Œª of cardinality Œª&lt;Œ∫, <em>A</em><sub>Œ±</sub> being pairwise disjoint sets of ordinals less than Œ∫, the measure of the union of the <em>A</em><sub>Œ±</sub> equals the sum of the measures of the individual <em>A</em><sub>Œ±</sub>.)</p>

<p>Equivalently, Œ∫ is measurable means that it is the <a href="critical_point_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">critical point</a> of a non-trivial <a href="elementary_embedding" title="wikilink">elementary embedding</a> of the <a href="universe_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">universe</a> <em>V</em> into a <a href="transitive_class" title="wikilink">transitive class</a> <em>M</em>. This equivalence is due to Jerome Keisler and <a href="Dana_Scott" title="wikilink">Dana Scott</a>, and uses the <a href="ultraproduct" title="wikilink">ultrapower</a> construction from <a href="model_theory" title="wikilink">model theory</a>. Since <em>V</em> is a <a href="proper_class" title="wikilink">proper class</a>, a technical problem that is not usually present when considering ultrapowers needs to be addressed, by what is now called <a href="Scott's_trick" title="wikilink">Scott's trick</a>.</p>

<p>Equivalently, Œ∫ is a measurable cardinal if and only if it is an uncountable cardinal with a Œ∫-complete, non-principal <a class="uri" href="ultrafilter" title="wikilink">ultrafilter</a>. Again, this means that the intersection of any <em>strictly less than</em> Œ∫-many sets in the ultrafilter, is also in the ultrafilter.</p>

<p>Although it follows from <a class="uri" href="ZFC" title="wikilink">ZFC</a> that every measurable cardinal is <a href="inaccessible_cardinal" title="wikilink">inaccessible</a> (and is <a href="Ineffable_cardinal" title="wikilink">ineffable</a>, <a href="Ramsey_cardinal" title="wikilink">Ramsey</a>, etc.), it is consistent with <a href="Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel_set_theory" title="wikilink">ZF</a> that a measurable cardinal can be a <a href="successor_cardinal" title="wikilink">successor cardinal</a>. It follows from ZF + <a href="axiom_of_determinacy" title="wikilink">axiom of determinacy</a> that œâ<sub>1</sub> is measurable, and that every subset of œâ<sub>1</sub> contains or is disjoint from a closed and unbounded subset.</p>

<p>The concept of a measurable cardinal was introduced by , who showed that the smallest cardinal Œ∫ that admits a non-trivial countably-additive two-valued measure must in fact admit a Œ∫-additive measure. (If there were some collection of fewer than Œ∫ measure-0 subsets whose union was Œ∫, then the induced measure on this collection would be a counterexample to the minimality of Œ∫.) From there, one can prove (with the Axiom of Choice) that the least such cardinal must be inaccessible.</p>

<p>It is trivial to note that if Œ∫ admits a non-trivial Œ∫-additive measure, then Œ∫ must be regular. (By non-triviality and Œ∫-additivity, any subset of cardinality less than Œ∫ must have measure 0, and then by Œ∫-additivity again, this means that the entire set must not be a union of fewer than Œ∫ sets of cardinality less than Œ∫.) Finally, if Œª Œª. If this were the case, then we could identify Œ∫ with some collection of 0-1 sequences of length Œª. For each position in the sequence, either the subset of sequences with 1 in that position or the subset with 0 in that position would have to have measure 1. The intersection of these Œª-many measure 1 subsets would thus also have to have measure 1, but it would contain exactly one sequence, which would contradict the non-triviality of the measure. Thus, assuming the Axiom of Choice, we can infer that Œ∫ is a strong limit cardinal, which completes the proof of its inaccessibility.</p>

<p>If Œ∫ is measurable and <em>p</em>‚àà<em>V</em><sub>Œ∫</sub> and <em>M</em> (the ultrapower of <em>V</em>) satisfies œà(Œ∫,<em>p</em>), then the set of Œ±&lt;Œ∫ such that <em>V</em> satisfies œà(Œ±,<em>p</em>) is stationary in Œ∫ (actually a set of measure 1). In particular if œà is a Œ†<sub>1</sub> formula and <em>V</em> satisfies œà(Œ∫,<em>p</em>), then <em>M</em> satisfies it and thus <em>V</em> satisfies œà(Œ±,<em>p</em>) for a stationary set of Œ±&lt;Œ∫. This property can be used to show that Œ∫ is a limit of most types of large cardinals which are weaker than measurable. Notice that the ultrafilter or measure which witnesses that Œ∫ is measurable cannot be in <em>M</em> since the smallest such measurable cardinal would have to have another such below it which is impossible.</p>

<p>Every measurable cardinal Œ∫ is a 0-<a href="huge_cardinal" title="wikilink">huge cardinal</a> because <sup>Œ∫</sup><em>M</em>‚äÇ<em>M</em>, that is, every function from Œ∫ to <em>M</em> is in <em>M</em>. Consequently, <em>V</em><sub>Œ∫+1</sub>‚äÇ<em>M</em>.</p>

<p>A cardinal Œ∫ is called <strong>real-valued measurable</strong> if there is a Œ∫-additive probability measure on the power set of Œ∫ which vanishes on singletons. Real-valued measurable cardinals were introduced by .  showed that the <a href="continuum_hypothesis" title="wikilink">continuum hypothesis</a> implies that

All measurable cardinals are real-valued measurable, and a real-valued measurable cardinal Œ∫ is measurable if and only if Œ∫ is greater than
