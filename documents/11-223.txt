Maleate hydratase

In enzymology, a maleate hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(R)-malate 
 
 
 
  maleate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (R)-malate, and two products, maleate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-malate hydro-lyase (maleate-forming). Other names in common use include D-malate hydro-lyase, malease, and (R)-malate hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism.
