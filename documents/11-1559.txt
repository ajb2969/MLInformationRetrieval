   Phosphatidylglycerol—membrane-oligosaccharide glycerophosphotransferase      Phosphatidylglycerol—membrane-oligosaccharide glycerophosphotransferase   In enzymology , a phosphatidylglycerol-membrane-oligosaccharide glycerophosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   phosphatidylglycerol + membrane-derived-oligosaccharide D-glucose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol + membrane-derived-oligosaccharide 6-(glycerophospho)-D-glucose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phosphatidylglycerol and membrane-derived-oligosaccharide D-glucose , whereas its two products are 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol and membrane-derived-oligosaccharide 6-(glycerophospho)-D-glucose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups transferases for other substituted phosphate groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphatidylglycerol:membrane-derived-oligosaccharide-D-glucose glycerophosphotransferase . Other names in common use include phosphoglycerol transferase , oligosaccharide glycerophosphotransferase , and phosphoglycerol transferase I . This enzyme participates in glycerolipid metabolism .
