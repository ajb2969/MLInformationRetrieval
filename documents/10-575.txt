Malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating)

Malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) () or NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-malate + NADP+

 
  pyruvate + CO2 + NADPH
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-malate and NAD+, whereas its three products are pyruvate, CO2, and NADH. Malate is oxidized  to pyruvate and CO2, and NAD+ is reduced to NADH.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, to be specific, those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-malate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating). This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism and carbon fixation. NAD-malic enzyme is one of three decarboxylation enzymes used in the inorganic carbon concentrating mechanisms of C4 and CAM plants. The others are NADP-malic enzyme and PEP carboxykinase.12
