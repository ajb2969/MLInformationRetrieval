   Bachmann–Howard ordinal      Bachmann–Howard ordinal   In mathematics, the Bachmann–Howard ordinal (or Howard ordinal ) is a large countable ordinal . It is the proof theoretic ordinal of several mathematical theories, such as Kripke–Platek set theory (with the axiom of infinity ) and the system CZF of constructive set theory . It is named after William Alvin Howard and Heinz Bachmann .  Definition  The Bachmann–Howard ordinal is defined using an ordinal collapsing function (with more details given in the relevant article):   ε α enumerates the epsilon numbers , the ordinals ε such that ω ε = ε.  Ω = ω 1 is the first uncountable ordinal .  ε Ω+1 is the first epsilon number after Ω = ε Ω .  ψ(0) is defined to be the smallest ordinal that cannot be constructed by starting with 0, 1, ω and Ω, and repeatedly applying ordinal addition, multiplication and exponentiation.  ψ(α) is defined in the same way, except that it also allows applications of ψ to previously constructed ordinals less than α.  The Bachmann–Howard ordinal is ψ(ε Ω+1 ).   The Bachmann–Howard ordinal can also be defined as     ϕ   ε   Ω  +  1      (  0  )        subscript  ϕ   subscript  ε    normal-Ω  1     0    \phi_{\varepsilon_{\Omega+1}}(0)   for an extension of the Veblen functions φ α to uncountable α; this extension is not completely straightforward.
