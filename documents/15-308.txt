   Markov–Kakutani fixed-point theorem      Markov–Kakutani fixed-point theorem   In mathematics , the Markov–Kakutani fixed-point theorem , named after Andrey Markov and Shizuo Kakutani , states that a commuting family of continuous affine self-mappings of a compact convex subset in a locally convex topological vector space has a common fixed point.  Statement  Let E be a locally convex topological vector space. Let C be a compact convex subset of E . Let S be a commuting family of self-mappings T of C which are continuous and affine, i.e. T ( tx +(1 – t ) y ) = tT ( x ) + (1 – t ) T ( y ) for t in [0,1] and x , y in C . Then the mappings have a common fixed point in C .  Proof for a single affine self-mapping  Let T be a continuous affine self-mapping of C .  For x in C define other elements of C by        x   (  N  )    =    1   N  +  1      ∑   n  =  0   N     T  n    (  x  )       .        x  N       1    N  1      superscript   subscript     n  0    N      superscript  T  n   x       x(N)={1\over N+1}\sum_{n=0}^{N}T^{n}(x).     Since C is compact, there is a convergent subnet in C :        x   (   N  i   )    →  y   .     normal-→    x   subscript  N  i    y    x(N_{i})\rightarrow y.\,     To prove that y is a fixed point, it suffices to show that f ( Ty ) = f ( y ) for every f in the dual of E . Since C is compact, | f | is bounded on C by a positive constant M . On the other hand        |    f   (   T  x   (  N  )    )    -   f   (   x   (  N  )    )     |   =    1   N  +  1     |    f   (    T   N  +  1    x   )    -   f   (  x  )     |    ≤    2  M    N  +  1     .              f    T  x  N      f    x  N          1    N  1          f     superscript  T    N  1    x      f  x               2  M     N  1       |f(Tx(N))-f(x(N))|={1\over N+1}|f(T^{N+1}x)-f(x)|\leq{2M\over N+1}.     Taking N = N i and passing to the limit as i goes to infinity, it follows that        f   (   T  y   )    =   f   (  y  )     .        f    T  y      f  y     f(Ty)=f(y).\,     Hence        T  y   =  y   .        T  y   y    Ty=y.\,     Proof of theorem  The set of fixed points of a single affine mapping T is a non-empty compact convex set C T by the result for a single mapping. The other mappings in the family S commute with T so leave C T invariant. Applying the result for a single mapping successively, it follows that any finite subset of S has a non-empty fixed point set given as the intersection of the compact convex sets C T as T ranges over the subset. From the compactness of C it follows that the set       C  S   =   {   y  ∈  C   |     T  y   =  y   ,   T  ∈  S    }   =    ⋂   T  ∈  S      C  T            superscript  C  S    conditional-set    y  C    formulae-sequence      T  y   y     T  S            subscript     T  S     superscript  C  T       C^{S}=\{y\in C|Ty=y,\,T\in S\}=\bigcap_{T\in S}C^{T}\,     is non-empty (and compact and convex).
