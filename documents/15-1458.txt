Delphinidin 3',5'-O-glucosyltransferase

Delphinidin 3',5'-O-glucosyltransferase (, UDP-glucose:anthocyanin 3',5'-O-glucosyltransferase, UA3'5'GZ) is an enzyme with system name UDP-glucose:delphinidin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)-beta-D-glucoside 3'-O-glucosyltransferase''.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2 UDP-glucose + delphinidin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)-beta-D-glucoside 
 
 
 
  2 UDP + delphinidin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)-beta-D-glucoside-3',5'-di-O-beta-D-glucoside (overall reaction)
 
(1a) UDP-glucose + delphinidin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)-beta-D-glucoside 
 
 
 
  UDP + delphinidin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)-beta-D-glucoside-3'-O-beta-D-glucoside
 
(1b) UDP-glucose + delphinidin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)-beta-D-glucoside-3'-O-beta-D-glucoside 
 
 
 
  UDP + delphinidin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)-beta-D-glucoside-3',5'-di-O-beta-D-glucoside
 

This enzyme catalyses two reactions in the biosynthesis of ternatin C5.
