   Flatness (electrical engineering)      Flatness (electrical engineering)   When measuring the flatness of a particular non-time-domain response, the measure of flatness defines the difference in a maximum and minimum value. For example, in a frequency response plot for an amplifier the flatness is defined as      flatness  =    max   (   P  out   )    -   min   (   P  out   )         flatness       subscript  P  out       subscript  P  out       \text{flatness}=\max\left(P_{\text{out}}\right)-\min\left(P_{\text{out}}\right)     where each output power measurement is in decibels .  Flatness of a signal  The flatness of a signal is defined as:  $$F = / ^2 $$  References  "  Category:Audio engineering
