Flatness (electrical engineering)

When measuring the flatness of a particular non-time-domain response, the measure of flatness defines the difference in a maximum and minimum value. For example, in a frequency response plot for an amplifier the flatness is defined as



where each output power measurement is in decibels.
Flatness of a signal
The flatness of a signal is defined as:
$$F = /^2
