   3-deoxyoctulosonase      3-deoxyoctulosonase   In enzymology , a 3-deoxyoctulosonase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-deoxyoctulosonyl-lipopolysaccharide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-deoxyoctulosonic acid + lipopolysaccharide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-deoxyoctulosonyl-lipopolysaccharide and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 3-deoxyoctulosonic acid and lipopolysaccharide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-deoxyoctulosonyl-lipopolysaccharide hydrolase . This enzyme is also called alpha-Kdo-ase .
