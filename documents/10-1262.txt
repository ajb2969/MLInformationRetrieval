   Aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+)      Aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+)   In enzymology , an aldehyde dehydrogenase [NAD(P)+] () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an aldehyde + NAD(P)+ + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   an acid + NAD(P)H + H +    The 4 substrates of this enzyme are aldehyde , NAD + , NADP + , and H 2 O , whereas its 4 products are acid , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aldehyde:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include aldehyde dehydrogenase [NAD(P)+] , and ALDH . This enzyme participates in 5 metabolic pathways : glycolysis / gluconeogenesis , histidine metabolism , tyrosine metabolism , phenylalanine metabolism , and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p450 .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .  References    Boyer, P.D., Lardy, H. and Myrback, K.
