Log-Laplace distribution

In probability theory and statistics, the log-Laplace distribution is the probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm has a Laplace distribution. If X has a Laplace distribution with parameters μ and b, then Y = eX has a log-Laplace distribution. The distributional properties can be derived from the Laplace distribution.
Characterization
Probability density function
A random variable has a log-Laplace(μ, b) distribution if its probability density function is:1









   \left\{\begin{matrix}
     \exp \left( -\frac{\mu-\ln x}{b} \right) & \mbox{if }x 
The cumulative distribution function for Y when y > 0, is



Versions of the log-Laplace distribution based on an asymmetric Laplace distribution also exist.2 Depending on the parameters, including asymmetry, the log-Laplace may or may not have a finite mean and a finite variance.3
