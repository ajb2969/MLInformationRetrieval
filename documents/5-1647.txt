Unique negative dimension

Unique negative dimension (UND) is a complexity measure for the model of learning from positive examples. The unique negative dimension of a class 
 
 
 
  of concepts is the size of the maximum subclass 
 
 
 
  such that for every concept 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
 
  is nonempty.
This concept was originally proposed by M. Gereb-Graus in "Complexity of learning from one-side examples", Technical Report TR-20-89, Harvard University Division of Engineering and Applied Science, 1989.
