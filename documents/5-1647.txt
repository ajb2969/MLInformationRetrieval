   Unique negative dimension      Unique negative dimension   Unique negative dimension (UND) is a complexity measure for the model of learning from positive examples . The unique negative dimension of a class   C   C   C   of concepts is the size of the maximum subclass    D  ⊆  C      D  C    D\subseteq C   such that for every concept    c  ∈  D      c  D    c\in D   , we have     ∩   (   D  ∖   {  c  }    )    ∖  c          D   c     c    \cap(D\setminus\{c\})\setminus c   is nonempty.  This concept was originally proposed by M. Gereb-Graus in "Complexity of learning from one-side examples", Technical Report TR-20-89, Harvard University Division of Engineering and Applied Science, 1989.
