   (1-4)-a-D-glucan 1-a-D-glucosylmutase      (1-4)-a-D-glucan 1-a-D-glucosylmutase   (1->4)-alpha-D-glucan 1-alpha-D-glucosylmutase (, malto-oligosyltrehalose synthase , maltodextrin alpha-D-glucosyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name (1->4)-alpha-D-glucan 1-alpha-D-glucosylmutase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   4-[(1->4)-alpha-D-glucosyl]n-1-D-glucose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-alpha-D-[(1->4)-alpha-D-glucosyl]n-1-alpha-D-glucopyranoside   The enzyme from Arthrobacter sp., Sulfolobus acidocaldarius acts on (1->4)-alpha-D-glucans containing three or more (1->4)-alpha-linked D-glucose units.
