   Arginine—pyruvate transaminase      Arginine—pyruvate transaminase   In enzymology , an arginine-pyruvate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-arginine + pyruvate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-guanidino-2-oxopentanoate + L-alanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-arginine and pyruvate , whereas its two products are 5-guanidino-2-oxopentanoate and L-alanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-arginine:pyruvate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include arginine:pyruvate transaminase , and AruH .
