Equilateral polygon

In geometry, an equilateral polygon is a polygon which has all sides of the same length.
All regular polygons and isotoxal polygons are equilateral.
An equilateral triangle is a regular triangle and 60 degree internal angles.




An equilateral quadrilateral is called a rhombus, an isotoxal polygon described by an angle α. It includes the square as a special case.




A convex equilateral pentagon can be described by two angles α and β. Concave equilateral pentagons exist, as do concave equilateral polygons with any larger number of sides.




An equilateral polygon which is cyclic (its vertices are on a circle) is a regular polygon (a polygon that is both equilateral and equiangular).
A tangential polygon (one that has an incircle tangent to all its sides) is equilateral if and only if the alternate angles are equal (that is, angles 1, 3, 5, ... are equal and angles 2, 4, ... are equal). Thus if the number of sides n is odd, a tangential polygon is equilateral if and only if it is regular.1
Viviani's theorem generalizes to equilateral polygons.2
The principal diagonals of a hexagon each divide the hexagon into quadrilaterals. In any convex equilateral hexagon with common side a, there exists3 a principal diagonal d1 such that



and a principal diagonal d2 such that
