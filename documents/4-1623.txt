Taut submanifold

In mathematics, a (compact) taut submanifold N of a space form M is a compact submanifold with the property that for every $q\in M\,$ the distance function
$$L_q:N\to\mathbf R,\qquad L_q(x) = \operatorname{dist}(x,q)^2\,$$
is a perfect Morse function.
If N is not compact, one needs to consider the restriction of the $L_q$ to any of their sublevel sets.
