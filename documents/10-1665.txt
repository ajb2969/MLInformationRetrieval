L-rhamnose isomerase




L-rhamnose isomerase

In enzymology, a L-rhamnose isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-rhamnose 
 
 
 
  L-rhamnulose
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-rhamnose, and one product, L-rhamnulose.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases interconverting aldoses and ketoses. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-rhamnose aldose-ketose-isomerase. Other names in common use include rhamnose isomerase, and L-rhamnose ketol-isomerase. This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism.
