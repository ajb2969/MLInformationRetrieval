Stimulated raman adiabatic passage

The Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) process permits transfer of a population between two applicable quantum states via at least two coherent electromagnetic (light) pulses. These light pulses drive the transitions of the three level Ʌ atom or multilevel system.12 The process is a form of state-to-state coherent control.
Population transfer in three level Ʌ atom
Consider the description of three level Ʌ atom having ground state

 
  and 
 
 
 
  (for simplicity consider the energy of both ground states are same) and excited state

 
  respectively. Suppose in the beginning the total population is in the ground state 
 
 
 
 
 . Here the logic for transformation of the population from ground state 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  is that initially the unpopulated states 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  couple, afterward superposition of state 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  couple to the state 
 
 
 
 . Thereby a state is formed that permits the transformation of the population into state 
 
 
 
  without populating the excited state 
 
 
 
 . This process of transforming the population without populating the excited state is called the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage.3
