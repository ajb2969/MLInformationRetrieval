   Stimulated raman adiabatic passage      Stimulated raman adiabatic passage   The Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) process permits transfer of a population between two applicable quantum states via at least two coherent electromagnetic (light) pulses . These light pulses drive the transitions of the three level Ʌ atom or multilevel system. 1 2 The process is a form of state-to-state coherent control .  Population transfer in three level Ʌ atom  Consider the description of three level Ʌ atom having ground state     |   g  1   ⟩     ket   subscript  g  1     |g_{1}\rangle   and    |   g  2   ⟩     ket   subscript  g  2     |g_{2}\rangle   (for simplicity consider the energy of both ground states are same) and excited state     |  e  ⟩     ket  e    |e\rangle   respectively. Suppose in the beginning the total population is in the ground state    |   g  1   ⟩     ket   subscript  g  1     |g_{1}\rangle   . Here the logic for transformation of the population from ground state    |   g  1   ⟩     ket   subscript  g  1     |g_{1}\rangle   to    |   g  2   ⟩     ket   subscript  g  2     |g_{2}\rangle   is that initially the unpopulated states    |   g  2   ⟩     ket   subscript  g  2     |g_{2}\rangle   and    |  e  ⟩     ket  e    |e\rangle   couple, afterward superposition of state    |   g  2   ⟩     ket   subscript  g  2     |g_{2}\rangle   and    |  e  ⟩     ket  e    |e\rangle   couple to the state    |   g  1   ⟩     ket   subscript  g  1     |g_{1}\rangle   . Thereby a state is formed that permits the transformation of the population into state    |   g  2   ⟩     ket   subscript  g  2     |g_{2}\rangle   without populating the excited state    |  e  ⟩     ket  e    |e\rangle   . This process of transforming the population without populating the excited state is called the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. 3  References  "  Category:Quantum mechanics     Unanyan, R., M.
