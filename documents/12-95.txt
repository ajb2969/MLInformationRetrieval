   Lagrange number      Lagrange number   In mathematics , the Lagrange numbers are a sequence of numbers that appear in bounds relating to the approximation of irrational numbers by rational numbers . They are linked to Hurwitz's theorem .  Definition  Hurwitz improved Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet 's criterion on irrationality to the statement that a real number α is irrational if and only if there are infinitely many rational numbers p / q , written in lowest terms, such that        |   α  -   p  q    |   <   1    5    q  2      .          α    p  q       1      5    superscript  q  2       \left|\alpha-\frac{p}{q}\right|<\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}q^{2}}.     This was an improvement on Dirichlet's result which had 1/ q 2 on the right hand side. The above result is best possible since the golden ratio φ is irrational but if we replace √5 by any larger number in the above expression then we will only be able to find finitely many rational numbers that satisfy the inequality for α = φ.  However, Hurwitz also showed that if we omit the number φ, and numbers derived from it, then we can increase the number √5, in fact he showed we may replace it with 2√2. Again this new bound is best possible in the new setting, but this time the number √2 is the problem. If we don't allow √2 then we can increase the number on the right hand side of the inequality from 2√2 to (√221)/5. Repeating this process we get an infinite sequence of numbers √5, 2√2, (√221)/5, ... which converge to 3. 1 These numbers are called the Lagrange numbers , 2 and are named after Joseph Louis Lagrange .  Relation to Markov numbers  The n th Lagrange number L n is given by       L  n   =    9  -   4   m  n    2           subscript  L  n       9    4   superscript   subscript  m  n   2        L_{n}=\sqrt{9-\frac{4}{{m_{n}}^{2}}}   where m n is the n th Markov number , 3 that is the n th smallest integer m such that the equation        m  2   +   x  2   +   y  2    =   3  m  x   y           superscript  m  2    superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2      3  m  x  y     m^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}=3mxy\,   has a solution in positive integers x and y .
