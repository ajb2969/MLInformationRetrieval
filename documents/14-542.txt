   Random modulation      Random modulation   In the theories of modulation and of stochastic processes , random modulation is the creation of a new signal from two other signals by the process of quadrature amplitude modulation . In particular, the two signals are considered as being random processes . For applications, the two original signals need have a limited frequency range, and these are used to modulate a third sinusoidal (carrier) signal whose frequency is above the range of frequencies contained in the original signals.  Details  The random modulation procedure starts with two stochastic baseband signals ,     x  c    (  t  )        subscript  x  c   t    x_{c}(t)   and     x  s    (  t  )        subscript  x  s   t    x_{s}(t)   , whose frequency spectrum is non-zero only for    f  ∈   [   -   B  /  2    ,   B  /  2   ]       f       B  2      B  2      f\in[-B/2,B/2]   . It applies quadrature modulation to combine these with a carrier frequency    f  0     subscript  f  0    f_{0}   (with     f  0   >   B  /  2        subscript  f  0     B  2     f_{0}>B/2   ) to form the signal    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   given by        x   (  t  )    =     x  c    (  t  )    cos   (   2  π   f  0   t   )     -    x  s    (  t  )    sin   (   2  π   f  0   t   )      =   ℜ   {    x  ¯    (  t  )    e   j  2  π   f  0   t     }     ,          x  t        subscript  x  c   t      2  π   subscript  f  0   t        subscript  x  s   t      2  π   subscript  f  0   t                normal-¯  x   t   superscript  e    j  2  π   subscript  f  0   t         x(t)=x_{c}(t)\cos(2\pi f_{0}t)-x_{s}(t)\sin(2\pi f_{0}t)=\Re\left\{\underline{%
 x}(t)e^{j2\pi f_{0}t}\right\},   where     x  ¯    (  t  )        normal-¯  x   t    \underline{x}(t)   is the equivalent baseband representation of the modulated signal    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)            x  ¯    (  t  )    =     x  c    (  t  )    +   j   x  s    (  t  )      .         normal-¯  x   t        subscript  x  c   t     j   subscript  x  s   t      \underline{x}(t)=x_{c}(t)+jx_{s}(t).     In the following it is assumed that     x  c    (  t  )        subscript  x  c   t    x_{c}(t)   and     x  s    (  t  )        subscript  x  s   t    x_{s}(t)   are two real jointly wide sense stationary processes. It can be shown that the new signal    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   is wide sense stationary if and only if      x  ¯    (  t  )        normal-¯  x   t    \underline{x}(t)   is circular complex, i.e. if and only if     x  c    (  t  )        subscript  x  c   t    x_{c}(t)   and     x  s    (  t  )        subscript  x  s   t    x_{s}(t)   are such that          R    x  c    x  c      (  τ  )    =     R    x  s    x  s      (  τ  )    and       R    x  c    x  s      (  τ  )    =   -    R    x  s    x  c      (  τ  )       .     formulae-sequence       subscript  R     subscript  x  c    subscript  x  c     τ       subscript  R     subscript  x  s    subscript  x  s     τ   and         subscript  R     subscript  x  c    subscript  x  s     τ        subscript  R     subscript  x  s    subscript  x  c     τ       R_{x_{c}x_{c}}(\tau)=R_{x_{s}x_{s}}(\tau)\qquad\text{and }\qquad R_{x_{c}x_{s}%
