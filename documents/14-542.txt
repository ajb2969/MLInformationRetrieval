Random modulation

In the theories of modulation and of stochastic processes, random modulation is the creation of a new signal from two other signals by the process of quadrature amplitude modulation. In particular, the two signals are considered as being random processes. For applications, the two original signals need have a limited frequency range, and these are used to modulate a third sinusoidal (carrier) signal whose frequency is above the range of frequencies contained in the original signals.
Details
The random modulation procedure starts with two stochastic baseband signals, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , whose frequency spectrum is non-zero only for 
 
 
 
 . It applies quadrature modulation to combine these with a carrier frequency 
 
 
 
 
  (with 
 
 
 
 ) to form the signal 
 
 
 
  given by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the equivalent baseband representation of the modulated signal 
 
 




In the following it is assumed that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are two real jointly wide sense stationary processes. It can be shown that the new signal 
 
 
 
  is wide sense stationary if and only if

 
 
  is circular complex, i.e. if and only if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are such that
