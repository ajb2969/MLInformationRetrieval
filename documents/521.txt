   Modular invariant theory      Modular invariant theory   In mathematics, a modular invariant of a group is an invariant of a finite group  acting on a vector space of positive characteristic (usually dividing the order of the group). The study of modular invariants was originated in about 1914 by .  Dickson invariant  When G is the finite general linear group GL n ( F q ) over the finite field F q of order a prime power q acting on the ring F q [ X 1 , ..., X n ] in the natural way,  found a complete set of invariants as follows. Write [ e 1 , ..., e n ] for the determinant of the matrix whose entries are X , where e 1 , ..., e n are non-negative integers. For example, the Moore determinant [0,1,2] of order 3 is      |      x  1      x  1  q      x  1   q  2         x  2      x  2  q      x  2   q  2         x  3      x  3  q      x  3   q  2       |         subscript  x  1    superscript   subscript  x  1   q    superscript   subscript  x  1    superscript  q  2       subscript  x  2    superscript   subscript  x  2   q    superscript   subscript  x  2    superscript  q  2       subscript  x  3    superscript   subscript  x  3   q    superscript   subscript  x  3    superscript  q  2        \begin{vmatrix}x_{1}&x_{1}^{q}&x_{1}^{q^{2}}\\
 x_{2}&x_{2}^{q}&x_{2}^{q^{2}}\\
 x_{3}&x_{3}^{q}&x_{3}^{q^{2}}\end{vmatrix}     Then under the action of an element g of GL n ( F q ) these determinants are all multiplied by det( g ), so they are all invariants of SL n ( F p ) and the ratios [ e 1 , ..., e n ]/[0, 1, ..., n − 1] are invariants of GL n ( F q ), called Dickson invariants . Dickson proved that the full ring of invariants F q [ X 1 , ..., X n ] GL n ( F q ) is a polynomial algebra over the n Dickson invariants [0, 1, ..., i − 1, i + 1, ..., n ]/[0,1,..., n −1] for i = 0, 1, ..., n − 1.  gave a shorter proof of Dickson's theorem.  The matrices [ e 1 , ..., e n ] are divisible by all non-zero linear forms in the variables X i with coefficients in the finite field F q . In particular the Moore determinant [0, 1, ..., n − 1] is a product of such linear forms, taken over 1 + q + q 2 + ... + q n – 1 representatives of ( n – 1)-dimensional projective space over the field. This factorization is similar to the factorization of the Vandermonde determinant into linear factors.  See also   Miss Sanderson's theorem   References         "  Category:Invariant theory
