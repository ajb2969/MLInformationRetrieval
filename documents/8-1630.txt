   Normal coordinates      Normal coordinates   In differential geometry , normal coordinates at a point p in a differentiable manifold equipped with a symmetric  affine connection are a local coordinate system in a neighborhood of p obtained by applying the exponential map to the tangent space at p . In a normal coordinate system, the Christoffel symbols of the connection vanish at the point p , thus often simplifying local calculations. In normal coordinates associated to the Levi-Civita connection of a Riemannian manifold , one can additionally arrange that the metric tensor is the Kronecker delta at the point p , and that the first partial derivatives of the metric at p vanish.  A basic result of differential geometry states that normal coordinates at a point always exist on a manifold with a symmetric affine connection. In such coordinates the covariant derivative reduces to a partial derivative (at p only), and the geodesics through p are locally linear functions of t (the affine parameter). This idea was implemented in a fundamental way by Albert Einstein in the general theory of relativity : the equivalence principle uses normal coordinates via inertial frames . Normal coordinates always exist for the Levi-Civita connection of a Riemannian or Pseudo-Riemannian manifold. By contrast, there is no way to define normal coordinates for Finsler manifolds .  Geodesic normal coordinates  Geodesic normal coordinates are local coordinates on a manifold with an affine connection afforded by the exponential map       exp  p   :     T  p   M   ⊃  V  →  M      normal-:   subscript   p      superset-of     subscript  T  p   M   V    normal-→    M      \exp_{p}:T_{p}M\supset V\rightarrow M     and an isomorphism      E  :    ℝ  n   →    T  p   M       normal-:  E   normal-→   superscript  ℝ  n      subscript  T  p   M      E:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow T_{p}M     given by any basis of the tangent space at the fixed basepoint p ∈ M . If the additional structure of a Riemannian metric is imposed, then the basis defined by E may be required in addition to be orthonormal , and the resulting coordinate system is then known as a Riemannian normal coordinate system .  Normal coordinates exist on a normal neighborhood of a point p in M . A normal neighborhood U is a subset of M such that there is a proper neighborhood V of the origin in the tangent space  T p M and exp p acts as a diffeomorphism between U and V . Now let U be a normal neighborhood of p in M then the chart is given by:       φ  :=    E   -  1    ∘   exp  p   -  1      :   U  →   ℝ  n       normal-:   assign  φ     superscript  E    1     superscript   subscript   p     1       normal-→  U   superscript  ℝ  n      \varphi:=E^{-1}\circ\exp_{p}^{-1}:U\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}     The isomorphism E can be any isomorphism between both vectorspaces, so there are as many charts as different orthonormal bases exist in the domain of E .  Properties  The properties of normal coordinates often simplify computations. In the following, assume that U is a normal neighborhood centered at p in M and (x i ) are normal coordinates on U .   Let V be some vector from T p M with components V i in local coordinates, and    γ  V     subscript  γ  V    \gamma_{V}   be the geodesic with starting point p and velocity vector V , then    γ  V     subscript  γ  V    \gamma_{V}   is represented in normal coordinates by      γ  V    (  t  )    =   (   t   V  1    ,  …  ,   t   V  n    )          subscript  γ  V   t      t   superscript  V  1    normal-…    t   superscript  V  n       \gamma_{V}(t)=(tV^{1},...,tV^{n})   as long as it is in U .  The coordinates of p are (0, ..., 0)  In Riemannian normal coordinates at p the components of the Riemannian metric  g simplify to    δ   i  j      subscript  δ    i  j     \delta_{ij}   .  The Christoffel symbols vanish at p . In the Riemannian case, so do the first partial derivatives of    g   i  j      subscript  g    i  j     g_{ij}   .   Polar coordinates  On a Riemannian manifold, a normal coordinate system at p facilitates the introduction of a system of spherical coordinates , known as polar coordinates . These are the coordinates on M obtained by introducing the standard spherical coordinate system on the Euclidean space T p M . That is, one introduces on T p M the standard spherical coordinate system ( r ,φ) where r ≥ 0 is the radial parameter and φ = (φ 1 ,...,φ n −1 ) is a parameterization of the ( n −1)-sphere . Composition of ( r ,φ) with the inverse of the exponential map at p is a polar coordinate system.  Polar coordinates provide a number of fundamental tools in Riemannian geometry. The radial coordinate is the most significant: geometrically it represents the geodesic distance to p of nearby points. Gauss's lemma asserts that the gradient of r is simply the partial derivative     ∂  /   ∂  r          r     \partial/\partial r   . That is,       ⟨   d  f   ,   d  r   ⟩   =    ∂  f    ∂  r           d  f     d  r        f     r      \langle df,dr\rangle=\frac{\partial f}{\partial r}   for any smooth function ƒ . As a result, the metric in polar coordinates assumes a block diagonal form       g  =   [     1    0     ⋯  0       0            ⋮        g   ;   ϕ  ϕ     (  r  ,  ϕ  )        0           ]    .      g    1  0    normal-⋯  0     0  absent  absent    normal-⋮  absent   fragments  g   subscript  normal-;    ϕ  ϕ     fragments  normal-(  r  normal-,  ϕ  normal-)      0  absent  absent      g=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&\cdots\ 0\\
