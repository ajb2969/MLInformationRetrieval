   Theobromine synthase      Theobromine synthase   In enzymology , a theobromine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 7-methylxanthine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3,7-dimethylxanthine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 7-methylxanthine , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and 3,7-dimethylxanthine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:7-methylxanthine N3-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include monomethylxanthine methyltransferase , MXMT , CTS1 , CTS2 , and S-adenosyl-L-methionine:7-methylxanthine 3-N-methyltransferase .
