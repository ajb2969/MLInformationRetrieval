   Golden–Thompson inequality      Golden–Thompson inequality   In physics and mathematics , the Golden–Thompson inequality , proved independently by  and , says that for Hermitian matrices  A and B ,       tr   e   A  +  B     ≤   tr   (    e  A    e  B    )         tr   superscript  e    A  B      tr     superscript  e  A    superscript  e  B       \operatorname{tr}\,e^{A+B}\leq\operatorname{tr}\left(e^{A}e^{B}\right)     where tr is the trace , and e A is the matrix exponential . This trace inequality is of particular significance in statistical mechanics , and was first derived in that context.  used the Kostant convexity theorem to generalize the Golden–Thompson inequality to all compact Lie groups.
