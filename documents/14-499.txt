Tversky index

The Tversky index, named after Amos Tversky,1 is an asymmetric similarity measure on sets that compares a variant to a prototype. The Tversky index can be seen as a generalization of Dice's coefficient and Tanimoto coefficient.
For sets X and Y the Tversky index is a number between 0 and 1 given by


 
 ,
Here, 
 
 
 
  denotes the  relative complement  of Y in X.
Further, 
 
 
 
  are parameters of the Tversky index. Setting 
 
 
 
  produces the Tanimoto coefficient; setting 
 
 
 
  produces Dice's coefficient.
If we consider X to be the prototype and Y to be the variant, then 
 
 
 
  corresponds to the weight of the prototype and 
 
 
 
  corresponds to the weight of the variant. Tversky measures with 
 
 
 
  are of special interest.2
Because of the inherent asymmetry, the Tversky index does not meet the criteria for a similarity metric. However, if symmetry is needed a variant of the original formulation has been proposed using max and min functions 3 .

This formulation also re-arranges parameters 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Thus, 
 
 
 
  controls the balance between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in the denominator. Similarly, 
 
 
 
  controls the effect of the symmetric difference 
 
 
 
  versus 
 
 
 
  in the denominator.
