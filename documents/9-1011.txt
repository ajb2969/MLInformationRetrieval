Kantorovich theorem




Kantorovich theorem

The Kantorovich theorem is a mathematical statement on the convergence of Newton's method. It was first stated by Leonid Kantorovich in 1940.
Newton's method constructs a sequence of points that—with good luck—will converge to a solution 
 
 
 
  of an equation 
 
 
 
  or a vector solution of a system of equation 
 
 
 
 . The Kantorovich theorem gives conditions on the initial point of this sequence. If those conditions are satisfied then a solution exists close to the initial point and the sequence converges to that point.
Assumptions
Let 
 
 
 
 
  be an open subset and 
 
 
 
  a differentiable function with a Jacobian

 
  that is locally Lipschitz continuous (for instance if it is twice differentiable). That is, it is assumed that for any open subset 
 
 
 
  there exists a constant 
 
 
 
  such that for any 
 
 




holds. The norm on the left is some operator norm that is compatible with the vector norm on the right. This inequality can be rewritten to only use the vector norm. Then for any vector 
 
 
 
  the inequality



must hold.
Now choose any initial point 
 
 
 
 . Assume that 
 
 
 
 
  is invertible and construct the Newton step 
 
 

The next assumption is that not only the next point 
 
 
 
  but the entire ball 
 
 
 
  is contained inside the set X. Let 
 
 
 
  be the Lipschitz constant for the Jacobian over this ball.
As a last preparation, construct recursively, as long as it is possible, the sequences 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  according to



Statement
Now if 
 
 
 
  then

a solution 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  exists inside the closed ball 
 
 
 
  and
the Newton iteration starting in 
 
 
 
  converges to 
 
 
 
  with at least linear order of convergence.

A statement that is more precise but slightly more difficult to prove uses the roots 
 
 
 
  of the quadratic polynomial


 
 ,


 
  and their ratio


 
  Then

a solution 
 
 
 
  exists inside the closed ball 
 
 

it is unique inside the bigger ball 
 
 

and the convergence to the solution of 
 
 
 
  is dominated by the convergence of the Newton iteration of the quadratic polynomial 
 
 
 
  towards its smallest root 
 
 
 
 ,1 if 
 
 
 
 , then
 
 


The quadratic convergence is obtained from the error estimate2
:

 \|\mathbf x_{n+1}-\mathbf x^*\|
   \le \theta^{2^n}\|\mathbf x_{n+1}-\mathbf x_n\|
   \le\frac{\theta^{2^n}}{2^n}\|\mathbf h_0\|.
