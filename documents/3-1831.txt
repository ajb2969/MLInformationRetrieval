   Chowla–Selberg formula      Chowla–Selberg formula   In mathematics , the Chowla–Selberg formula is the evaluation of a certain product of values of the Gamma function at rational values in terms of values of the Dedekind eta function at imaginary quadratic irrational numbers. The result was essentially found by  and rediscovered by .  Statement  In logarithmic form, the Chowla–Selberg formula states that in certain cases the sum        w  4     ∑  r    χ   (  r  )    log  Γ    (   r  D   )      =     h  2    log   (   4  π    |  D  |     )     +    ∑  τ    log   (     ℑ   (  τ  )       |   η   (  τ  )    |   2    )              w  4     subscript   r     χ  r    normal-Γ     r  D            h  2       4  π      D         subscript   τ           τ     superscript      η  τ    2         \frac{w}{4}\sum_{r}\chi(r)\log\Gamma\left(\frac{r}{D}\right)=\frac{h}{2}\log(4%
 \pi\sqrt{|D|})+\sum_{\tau}\log\left(\sqrt{\Im(\tau)}|\eta(\tau)|^{2}\right)     can be evaluated using the Kronecker limit formula . Here χ is the quadratic residue symbol modulo D , where −D is the discriminant of an imaginary quadratic field . The sum is taken over 0 \Im(\tau)|\eta(\tau)|^4 = \frac{\alpha}{4\pi\sqrt{|D|}} \prod_r\Gamma(r/|D|)^{\chi(r)\frac{w}{2h}} for some algebraic number α.  Examples  Using the reflection formula for the gamma function gives:        η   (  i  )    =    2   -  1     π   -   3  /  4     Γ   (   1  4   )          η  i      superscript  2    1     superscript  π      3  4     normal-Γ    1  4      \eta(i)=2^{-1}\pi^{-3/4}\Gamma(\tfrac{1}{4})      See also   Multiplication theorem   References        "  Category:Theorems in number theory  Category:Gamma and related functions
