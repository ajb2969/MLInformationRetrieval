   Blum axioms      Blum axioms   In computational complexity theory the Blum axioms or Blum complexity axioms are axioms that specify desirable properties of complexity measures on the set of computable functions . The axioms were first defined by Manuel Blum in 1967. 1  Importantly, the Speedup and Gap theorems hold for any complexity measure satisfying these axioms. The most well-known measures satisfying these axioms are those of time (i.e., running time) and space (i.e., memory usage).  Definitions  A Blum complexity measure is a tuple    (  œÜ  ,  Œ¶  )     œÜ  normal-Œ¶    (\varphi,\Phi)   with   œÜ   œÜ   \varphi   a G√∂del numbering of the partial computable functions     ùêè   (  1  )      superscript  ùêè  1    \mathbf{P}^{(1)}   and a computable function      Œ¶  :   ‚Ñï  ‚Üí   ùêè   (  1  )        normal-:  normal-Œ¶   normal-‚Üí  ‚Ñï   superscript  ùêè  1      \Phi:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbf{P}^{(1)}   which satisfies the following Blum axioms . We write    œÜ  i     subscript  œÜ  i    \varphi_{i}   for the i -th partial computable function under the G√∂del numbering   œÜ   œÜ   \varphi   , and    Œ¶  i     subscript  normal-Œ¶  i    \Phi_{i}   for the partial computable function    Œ¶   (  i  )       normal-Œ¶  i    \Phi(i)   .   the domains of    œÜ  i     subscript  œÜ  i    \varphi_{i}   and    Œ¶  i     subscript  normal-Œ¶  i    \Phi_{i}   are identical.  the set    {    (  i  ,  x  ,  t  )   ‚àà   ‚Ñï  3    |     Œ¶  i    (  x  )    =  t   }     conditional-set     i  x  t    superscript  ‚Ñï  3         subscript  normal-Œ¶  i   x   t     \{(i,x,t)\in\mathbb{N}^{3}|\Phi_{i}(x)=t\}   is recursive .   Examples       (  œÜ  ,  Œ¶  )     œÜ  normal-Œ¶    (\varphi,\Phi)   is a complexity measure, if   Œ¶   normal-Œ¶   \Phi   is either the time or the memory (or some suitable combination thereof) required for the computation coded by i .      (  œÜ  ,  œÜ  )     œÜ  œÜ    (\varphi,\varphi)   is not a complexity measure, since it fails the second axiom.   Notes  A Blum complexity measure is defined using computable functions without any reference to a specific model of computation . In order to make the definition more accessible we rephrase the Blum axioms in terms of Turing machines :  A Blum complexity measure is a function   Œ¶   normal-Œ¶   \Phi   from pairs (Turing machine   M   M   M   , input   x   x   x   for   M   M   M   ) to the natural numbers union infinity. Furthermore,   Œ¶   normal-Œ¶   \Phi   should satisfy the following axioms:       Œ¶   (  M  ,  x  )       normal-Œ¶   M  x     \Phi(M,x)   is finite if and only if    M   (  x  )       M  x    M(x)    halts  There is an algorithm which, on input    (  M  ,  x  ,  n  )     M  x  n    (M,x,n)   decides if     Œ¶   (  M  ,  x  )    =  n        normal-Œ¶   M  x    n    \Phi(M,x)=n      For example, suppose    Œ¶   (  M  ,  x  )       normal-Œ¶   M  x     \Phi(M,x)   gives the number of time steps that the machine M runs for on input x before halting. The first axiom is clear; the second follows because a universal Turing machine can simulate M on x while counting its steps. If M exceeds n steps, it can halt and reject, so there is no need to determine if M halts on x .  Complexity classes  For a total computable function    f   f   f    complexity classes of computable functions can be defined as       C   (  f  )    :=   {    œÜ  i   ‚àà   ùêè   (  1  )     |    ‚àÄ  x   .     Œ¶  i    (  x  )    ‚â§   f   (  x  )      }      assign    C  f    conditional-set     subscript  œÜ  i    superscript  ùêè  1     formulae-sequence   for-all  x        subscript  normal-Œ¶  i   x     f  x        C(f):=\{\varphi_{i}\in\mathbf{P}^{(1)}|\forall x.\ \Phi_{i}(x)\leq f(x)\}           C  0    (  f  )    :=   {   h  ‚àà   C   (  f  )     |    codom   (  h  )    ‚äÜ   {  0  ,  1  }    }      assign     superscript  C  0   f    conditional-set    h    C  f        codom  h    0  1       C^{0}(f):=\{h\in C(f)|\mathrm{codom}(h)\subseteq\{0,1\}\}       C   (  f  )       C  f    C(f)   is the set of all computable functions with a complexity less than   f   f   f   .     C  0    (  f  )        superscript  C  0   f    C^{0}(f)   is the set of all boolean-valued functions with a complexity less than   f   f   f   . If we consider those functions as indicator functions on sets,     C  0    (  f  )        superscript  C  0   f    C^{0}(f)   can be thought of as a complexity class of sets.
