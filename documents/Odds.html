<h1>Odds</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Odds</strong> are a numerical expression, always consisting of a pair of numbers, used in both <a class="uri" href="gambling" title="wikilink">gambling</a> and <a class="uri" href="statistics" title="wikilink">statistics</a>. In statistics, <strong>odds for</strong> reflect the likelihood that a particular <a href="event_(probability_theory)" title="wikilink">event</a> will take place. <strong>Odds against</strong> reflect the likelihood that a particular <a href="event_(probability_theory)" title="wikilink">event</a> will not take place. The usages of the term among statisticians and probabilists on the one hand, versus in the gambling world on the other hand, are not consistent with each other (with the exception of horse racing).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Conventionally, gambling odds are expressed in the form "X to Y", where X and Y are numbers, and it is implied that the odds are odds against the event on which the gambler is considering wagering. In both gambling and statistics, the 'odds' are a numerical expression of how likely some possible future event is.</p>

<p>In gambling, odds represent the ratio between the amounts staked by parties to a <a class="uri" href="wager" title="wikilink">wager</a> or bet.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Thus, odds of 6 to 1 mean the first party (normally a <a class="uri" href="bookmaker" title="wikilink">bookmaker</a>) is staking six times the amount that the second party is. Thus, gambling odds of '6 to 1' mean that there are six possible outcomes in which the event will not take place to every one where it will. In other words, the probability that X will not happen is six times the probability that it will.</p>

<p>In statistics, the <strong>odds for</strong> an event E are defined as a simple function of the <a class="uri" href="probability" title="wikilink">probability</a> of that possible event E. One drawback of expressing the <a class="uri" href="uncertainty" title="wikilink">uncertainty</a> of this possible event as <strong>odds for</strong> is that to regain the probability requires a calculation. The natural way to interpret <strong>odds for</strong> (without calculating anything) is as the ratio of events to non-events in the long run. A simple example is that the (statistical) <strong>odds for</strong> rolling six with a fair die (one of a pair of <a class="uri" href="dice" title="wikilink">dice</a>) are 1 to 5. This is because, if one rolls the die many times, and keeps a tally of the results, one expects 1 six event for every 5 times the die does not show six. For example, if we roll the fair die 600 times, we would very much expect something in the neighborhood of 100 sixes, and 500 of the other five possible outcomes. That is a ratio of 100 to 500, or simply 1 to 5. To express the (statistical) <strong>odds against</strong>, the order of the pair is reversed. Hence the <strong>odds against</strong> rolling a six with a fair die are 5 to 1. The <a class="uri" href="probability" title="wikilink">probability</a> of rolling a six with a fair die is the single number 1/6 or approximately 16.7%.</p>

<p>The gambling and statistical uses of odds are closely interlinked. If a bet is a <a href="fair_value" title="wikilink">fair</a> one, as in a wager between friends, then the odds offered to the gamblers will perfectly reflect relative probabilities. A fair bet that a fair die will roll a six will pay the gambler $5 for a $1 wager (and return the bettor his or her wager) in the case of a six and nothing in any other case. The terms of the bet are fair, because on average, five rolls result in something other than a six, at a cost of $5, for every roll that results in a six and a net payout of $5. The profit and the expense exactly offset one another and so there is no disadvantage to gambling over the long run. If the odds being offered to the gamblers do not correspond to probability in this way then one of the parties to the bet has an advantage over the other. Casinos, for example, offer odds that place themselves at an advantage, which is how they guarantee themselves a profit and survive as businesses. The fairness of a particular gamble is more clear in a game involving relatively pure chance, such as the ping-pong ball method used in state lotteries in the United States. It is much harder to judge the fairness of the odds offered in a wager on a sporting event such as a football match.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The language of odds such as "ten to one" for intuitively estimated risks is found in the sixteenth century, well before the development of mathematical <a class="uri" href="probability" title="wikilink">probability</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Shakespeare wrote:</p>

<p>The sixteenth century polymath <a class="uri" href="Cardano" title="wikilink">Cardano</a> demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes (which implies that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>).</p>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>

<p>Odds are expressed in the form X to Y, where X and Y are numbers. Usually, the word "to" is replaced by a symbol for ease of use. This is conventionally either a <a href="slash_(punctuation)" title="wikilink">slash</a> or <a class="uri" href="hyphen" title="wikilink">hyphen</a>, although a <a href="colon_(punctuation)" title="wikilink">colon</a> is sometimes seen. Thus, 6/1, 6-1 and 6:1 are all interchangeable.</p>
<h3 id="odds-against">Odds against</h3>

<p>When the probability that the event will not happen is greater than the probability that it will, then the odds are "against" that event happening. Odds of, for example, 6 to 1 are therefore sometimes said to be "6 to 1 <em>against</em>". To a gambler, "odds against" means that the amount he or she will win is greater than the amount staked.</p>
<h3 id="odds-on">Odds on</h3>

<p>"Odds on" is the opposite of "odds against". It means that the event is more likely to happen than not. This is sometimes expressed with the smaller number first (1 to 2) but more often using the word "on" ("2 to 1 <em>on</em>") meaning that the event is twice as likely to happen as not. Note that the gambler who bets at "odds on" and wins will still be in profit, as his stake will be returned. For example, on a £2 bet, the gambler will be given £1 plus the returned stake of £2, yielding a £1 profit.</p>
<h3 id="even-odds">Even odds</h3>

<p>"Even odds" occur when the probability of an event happening is exactly the same as it not happening. In common parlance, this is a "50-50 chance". Guessing <a href="heads_or_tails" title="wikilink">heads or tails</a> on a <a href="coin_toss" title="wikilink">coin toss</a> is the classic example of an event that has even odds. In gambling, it is commonly referred to as "<a href="even_money" title="wikilink">even money</a>" or simply "evens" (1 to 1, or 2 for 1). "Evens" implies that the payout will be one unit per unit wagered plus the original stake, that is, "double-your-money".</p>
<h4 id="better-thanworse-than-evens">Better than/worse than evens</h4>

<p>The term "better than evens" (or "worse than evens") varies in meaning depending on context. Looked at from the perspective of a gambler rather than a statistician, "better than evens" means "odds against". If the odds are evens (1/1), and one bets 10 units, one would be returned 20 units, making a profit of 10 units. If the gamble was paying 4/1 and the event occurred, one would make 50 units, or a profit of 40 units. So, it is "better than evens" from the gambler's perspective because it pays out more than one-for-one. If an event is more likely to occur than an even chance, then the odds will be "worse than evens", and the bookmaker will pay out less than one-for-one.</p>

<p>However, in popular parlance surrounding uncertain events, the expression "better than evens" usually implies a better than (greater than) 50% chance of the event occurring, which is exactly the opposite of the meaning of the expression when used in a gaming context.</p>
<h2 id="statistical-usage">Statistical usage</h2>

<p>In statistics, <strong>odds</strong> are an expression of relative probabilities, generally quoted as the odds <em>in favor.</em> The odds (in favor) of an <a href="event_(probability_theory)" title="wikilink">event</a> or a <a class="uri" href="proposition" title="wikilink">proposition</a> is the ratio of the probability that the event will happen to the probability that the event will not happen. Mathematically, this is a <a href="Bernoulli_trial" title="wikilink">Bernoulli trial</a>, as it has exactly two outcomes. In case of a finite <a href="sample_space" title="wikilink">sample space</a> of <a href="equally_likely_outcomes" title="wikilink">equally likely outcomes</a>, this is the ratio of the number of <a href="Outcome_(probability)" title="wikilink">outcomes</a> where the event occurs to the number of outcomes where the event does not occur; these can be represented as <em>W</em> and <em>L</em> (for Wins and Losses) or <em>S</em> and <em>F</em> (for Success and Failure). For example, the odds that a <a href="random_variable" title="wikilink">randomly chosen</a> day of the week is a weekend are two to five (2:5), as days of the week form a sample space of seven outcomes, and the event occurs for two of the outcomes (Saturday and Sunday), and not for the other five.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Conversely, given odds as a ratio of integers, this can be represented by a probability space of a finite number of equally likely outcomes. These definitions are equivalent, since dividing both terms in the ratio by the number of outcomes yields the probabilities

 Conversely, the odds against is the opposite ratio. For example, the odds against a random day of the week being a weekend are 5:2.</p>

<p>Odds and probability can be expressed in prose via the prepositions <em>to</em> and <em>in:</em> "odds of so many <em>to</em> so many on (or against) [some event]" refers to <em>odds</em> – the ratio of numbers of (equally likely) outcomes in favor and against (or vice versa); "chances of so many [outcomes], <em>in</em> so many [outcomes]" refers to <em>probability</em> – the number of (equally like) outcomes in favour relative to the number for and against combined. For example, "odds of a weekend are 2 <em>to</em> 5", while "chances of a weekend are 2 <em>in</em> 7". In casual use, the words <em>odds</em> and <em>chances</em> (or <em>chance</em>) are often used interchangeably to vaguely indicate some measure of odds or probability, though the intended meaning can be deduced by noting whether the preposition between the two numbers is <em>to</em> or <em>in</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="mathematical-relations">Mathematical relations</h3>

<p>Odds can be expressed as a ratio of two numbers, in which case it is not unique – scaling both terms by the same factor does not change the proportions: 1:1 odds and 100:100 odds are the same (even odds). Odds can also be expressed as a number, by dividing the terms in the ratio – in this case it is unique (different <a href="Fraction_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">fractions</a> can represent the same <a href="rational_number" title="wikilink">rational number</a>). Odds as a ratio, odds as a number, and probability (also a number) are related by simple formulas, and similarly odds in favor and odds against, and probability of success and probability of failure have simple relations. Odds range from 0 to infinity, while probabilities range from 0 to 1, and hence are often represented as a percentage between 0% and 100%: reversing the ratio switches odds for with odds against, and similarly probability of success with probability of failure.</p>

 Thus if expressed as a fraction with a numerator of 1, probability and odds differ by exactly 1 in the denominator: a probability of 1 <em>in</em> 100 (1/100 = 1%) is the same as odds of 1 <em>to</em> 99 (1/99 = 0.0101… = 0.

<p>These transforms have certain special geometric properties: the conversions between odds for and odds against (resp. probability of success with probability of failure) and between odds and probability are all <a href="Möbius_transformation" title="wikilink">Möbius transformations</a> (fractional linear transformations). They are thus are <a href="Möbius_transformation#Specifying_a_transformation_by_three_points" title="wikilink">specified by three points</a> (<a href="Sharply_multiply_transitive" title="wikilink">sharply 3-transitive</a>). Swapping odds for and odds against swaps 0 and infinity, fixing 1, while swapping probability of success with probability of failure swaps 0 and 1, fixing .5; these are both order 2, hence <a href="circular_transform" title="wikilink">circular transforms</a>. Converting odds to probability fixes 0, sends infinity to 1, and sends 1 to .5 (even odds are 50% likely), and conversely; this is a <a href="parabolic_transform" title="wikilink">parabolic transform</a>.</p>
<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>

<p>In <a href="probability_theory" title="wikilink">probability theory</a> and <a href="Bayesian_statistics" title="wikilink">Bayesian statistics</a>, odds may sometimes be more natural or more convenient than probabilities. This is often the case in problems of sequential decision making as for instance in problems of how to stop (online) on a <strong>last specific event</strong> which is solved by the <a href="odds_algorithm" title="wikilink">odds algorithm</a>. Similar ratios are used elsewhere in Bayesian statistics, such as the <a href="Bayes_factor" title="wikilink">Bayes factor</a>.</p>

<p>The odds are a <a class="uri" href="ratio" title="wikilink">ratio</a> of probabilities; an <a href="odds_ratio" title="wikilink">odds ratio</a> is a ratio of odds, that is, a ratio of ratios of probabilities. Odds-ratios are often used in analysis of <a href="clinical_trial" title="wikilink">clinical trials</a>. While they have useful mathematical properties, they can produce counter-<a href="Intuition_(knowledge)" title="wikilink">intuitive</a> results: an event with an 80% probability of occurring is four times <em>more likely</em> to happen than an event with a 20% probability, but the <em>odds</em> are 16 times higher on the less likely event (4–1 <em>against</em>, or 4) than on the more likely one (1–4, or 4–1 <em>on</em>, or 0.25).</p>

<p>In some cases the <a class="uri" href="log-odds" title="wikilink">log-odds</a> are used, which is the <a class="uri" href="logit" title="wikilink">logit</a> of the probability. Most simply, odds are frequently multiplied or divided, and log converts multiplication to addition and division to subtractions.</p>

<dt>Example #1: There are 5 pink marbles, 2 blue marbles, and 8 purple marbles. What are the odds in favor of picking a blue marble?</dt>
</dl>

<p>Answer: The odds in favour of a blue marble are 2:13. One can equivalently say, that the odds are 13:2 <em>against</em>. There are 2 out of 15 chances in favour of blue, 13 out of 15 against blue.</p>

<p>In <a href="probability_theory" title="wikilink">probability theory</a> and <a class="uri" href="statistics" title="wikilink">statistics</a>, where the variable <em>p</em> is the <a class="uri" href="probability" title="wikilink">probability</a> in favor of a binary event, and the probability against the event is therefore 1-<em>p</em>, "the odds" of the event are the quotient of the two, or

<p>In the very first example at top, saying the odds of a Sunday are "one to six" or, less commonly, "one-sixth" means the probability of picking a Sunday randomly is one-sixth the probability of not picking a Sunday.

<p>Answer: 7:8</p>
<h2 id="gambling-usage">Gambling usage</h2>

<p>The use of odds in gambling arose to facilitate betting on events where the relative probabilities of outcomes varied. For example, on a <a href="coin_toss" title="wikilink">coin toss</a> or a <a href="match_race" title="wikilink">match race</a> between two evenly matched horses, it is reasonable for two people to wager level stakes. However, in more variable situations, such as a multi-runner horse race or a football match between two unequally matched sides, betting "at odds" provides more scope.</p>

<p>In the modern era, most fixed odds betting takes place between a betting organisation, such as a <a class="uri" href="bookmaker" title="wikilink">bookmaker</a>, and an individual, rather than between individuals. Different traditions have grown up in how to express odds to customers.</p>
<h3 id="fractional-odds">Fractional odds</h3>

<p>Favoured by <a href="bookmaker" title="wikilink">bookmakers</a> in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> and <a class="uri" href="Ireland" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>, and also common in <a href="horse_racing" title="wikilink">horse racing</a>, fractional odds quote the net total that will be paid out to the bettor, should he or she win, relative to the stake.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Odds of 4/1 ("four-to-one" or less commonly "four-to-one <em>against</em>") would imply that the bettor stands to make a £400 profit on a £100 stake. If the odds are 1/4 (read "one-to-four", or "four-to-one <em>on</em>"), the bettor will make £25 on a £100 stake. In either case, <em>against</em> or <em>on</em>, having won, the bettor always receives the original stake back; so if the odds are 4/1 the bettor receives a total of £500 (£400 plus the original £100). Odds of 1/1 are known as <em>evens</em> or <em>even money</em>.</p>

<p>The <a class="uri" href="numerator" title="wikilink">numerator</a> and <a class="uri" href="denominator" title="wikilink">denominator</a> of fractional odds are always <a href="integer" title="wikilink">integers</a>, thus if the bookmaker's payout was to be £1.25 for every £1 stake, this would be equivalent to £5 for every £4 staked, and the odds would therefore be expressed as 5/4. However, not all fractional odds are traditionally read using the <a href="lowest_common_denominator" title="wikilink">lowest common denominator</a>. For example, given that there is a pattern of odds of 5/4, 7/4, 9/4 and so on, odds which are mathematically 3/2 are more easily compared if expressed in the equivalent form 6/4. Perhaps most unusual is that odds of 10/3 are read as "one-hundred-to-thirty", because "ten-to-three" could be confused with a race time.</p>

<p>Fractional odds are also known as <em>British odds,</em> <em>UK odds,</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> or, in that country, <em>traditional odds</em>. They are typically represented with a "/" but can also be represented with a "-", e.g. 4/1 or 4-1.</p>

<p>A variation of fractional odds is known as <em>Hong Kong</em> odds. Fractional and Hong Kong odds are actually exchangeable. The only difference is that the UK odds are presented as a fractional notation (e.g. 6/5) whilst the Hong Kong odds are decimal (e.g. 1.2). Both exhibit the net return.</p>

<p>The European odds also represent the potential winnings (net returns), but in addition they factor in the stake (e.g. 6/5 or 1.2 plus 1 = 2.2).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="decimal-odds">Decimal odds</h3>

<p>Favoured in continental <a class="uri" href="Europe" title="wikilink">Europe</a>, <a class="uri" href="Australia" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> and <a class="uri" href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, decimal odds differ from fractional odds in that the bettor must first part with their stake in order to make a bet, the figure quoted is the winning amount that would be paid out to the bettor.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Therefore, the decimal odds of an outcome are equivalent to the decimal value of the fractional odds plus one.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Thus even odds 1/1 are quoted in decimal odds as 2. The 4/1 fractional odds discussed above are quoted as 5, while the 1/4 odds are quoted as 1.25. This is considered to be ideal for <a href="Parlay_(gambling)" title="wikilink">parlay</a> betting, because the odds to be paid out are simply the product of the odds for each outcome wagered on. Decimal odds are also favoured by <a href="betting_exchanges" title="wikilink">betting exchanges</a> because they are the easiest to work with for trading.</p>

<p>Decimal odds are also known as <em>European odds</em>, <em>digital odds</em> or <em>continental odds.</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="moneyline-odds">Moneyline odds</h3>

<p>Moneyline odds are favoured by American bookmakers. There are two possibilities, the figure quote can be either positive or negative.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Positive figures</dt>
<dd>If the figure quoted is positive, the odds are quoting how much money will be won on a $100 wager (this is done if the odds are better than even). Fractional odds of 4/1 would be quoted as +400, while fractional odds of 1/4 cannot be quoted as a positive figure. (This would correspond to .25/1, quoted as *+25, but this is not done.)
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Negative figures</dt>
<dd>If the figure quoted is negative, then the moneyline odds are quoting how much money must be wagered to win $100 (this is done if the odds are worse than even). Fractional odds of 1/4 would be quoted as −400, while fractional odds of 4/1 cannot be quoted as a negative figure. (This would correspond to 1/.25, quoted as *−25, but this is not done.)
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Moneyline odds are often referred to as <em>American odds</em>. Moneyline refers to odds on the straight-up outcome of a game with no consideration to a <a href="Spread_betting" title="wikilink">point spread</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gambling-odds-versus-probabilities">Gambling odds versus probabilities</h2>

<p>In gambling, the odds on display do not represent the true chances (as imagined by the bookmaker) that the event will or will not occur, but are the amount that the <a class="uri" href="bookmaker" title="wikilink">bookmaker</a> will pay out on a winning bet, together with the required stake. For instance, if the bookmaker offers odds of 4:6 against a certain horse winning a race, this means that he'll accept a $6 stake in return for a payoff of $4, plus return of the stake, if the horse wins. If the horse loses, the bookmaker keeps the stake. In formulating the odds to display the bookmaker will have included a profit margin which effectively means that the payout to a successful <a href="gambler" title="wikilink">bettor</a> is less than that represented by the true chance of the event occurring. This profit is known as the 'over-round' on the 'book' (the 'book' refers to the old-fashioned ledger in which wagers were recorded, and is the derivation of the term 'bookmaker') and relates to the sum of the 'odds' in the following way:</p>

<p>In a 3-horse race, for example, the true probabilities of each of the horses winning based on their relative abilities may be 50%, 40% and 10%. The total of these three percentages is 100%, thus representing a fair 'book'. The true odds against winning for each of the three horses are 1-1, 3-2 and 9-1 respectively.</p>

<p>In order to generate a profit on the wagers accepted, the bookmaker may decide to increase the values to 60%, 50% and 20% for the three horses, representing odds against of 4-6, 1-1 and 4-1. These values now total 130%, meaning that the book has an <a href="Mathematics_of_bookmaking" title="wikilink">overround</a> of 30 (130 − 100). This value of 30 represents the amount of profit if the bookmaker accepts bets in the correct proportions on each of the horses. The art of bookmaking is that the bookmaker will take in, for example, $130 in wagers and only pay $100 back (including stakes) no matter which horse wins.</p>

<p>Profiting in <a class="uri" href="gambling" title="wikilink">gambling</a> involves predicting the relationship of the true probabilities to the payout odds. <a href="Sports_information_service" title="wikilink">Sports information services</a> are often used by professional and semi-professional sports bettors to help achieve this goal.</p>

<p>The odds or amounts the bookmaker will pay are determined by the total amount that has been bet on all of the possible events. They reflect the balance of wagers on either side of the event, and include the deduction of a bookmaker’s brokerage fee ("vig" or <a class="uri" href="vigorish" title="wikilink">vigorish</a>).</p>

<p>Also, depending on how the betting is affected by jurisdiction, taxes may be involved for the bookmaker and/or the winning player. This may be taken into account when offering the odds and/or may reduce the amount won by a player.</p>
