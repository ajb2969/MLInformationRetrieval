Superelliptic curve

In mathematics, a superelliptic curve is a plane curve with an equation of the form


 
  where the exponent m is fixed and f is a polynomial of degree d. The case m = 2 and d > 4 is a hyperelliptic curve: the case m = 3 and d = 4 is a trigonal curve.
The Diophantine problem of finding integer points on a superelliptic curve can be solved by a method similar to one used for the resolution of hyperelliptic equations: a Siegel identity is used to reduce to a Thue equation.
Definition
More generally, a superelliptic curve is a cyclic branched covering


 
  of the projective line of degree 
 
 
 
  coprime to the characteristic of the field of definition. The degree 
 
 
 
  of the covering map is also referred to as the degree of the curve. By cyclic covering we mean that the Galois group of the covering (i.e., the corresponding function field extension) is cyclic.
The fundamental theorem of Kummer theory implies  that a superelliptic curve of degree 
 
 
 
  defined over a field 
 
 
 
  has an affine model given by an equation


 
  for some polynomial 
 
 
 
  of degree 
 
 
 
  with each root having order 
Ramification
Let 
 
 
 
  be a superelliptic curve defined over an algebraically closed field 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  denote the set of roots of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . Define set


 
  Then 
 
 
 
  is the set of branch points of the covering map 
 
 
 
  given by 
 
 
 
 .
For an affine branch point 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  denote the order of 
 
 
 
  as a root of 
 
 
 
 . As before, we assume that 
 
 
 
 . Then


 
  is the ramification index 
 
 
 
  at each of the 
 
 
 
  ramification points 
 
 
 
  of the curve lying over 
 
 
 
  (that is actually true for any 
 
 
 
 ).
For the point at infinity, define integer 
 
 
 
  as follows. If


 
  then 
 
 
 
 . Note that 
 
 
 
 . Then analogously to the other ramification points,


 
  is the ramification index 
 
 
 
  at the 
 
 
 
  points 
 
 
 
  that lie over 
 
 
 
 . In particular, the curve is unramified over infinity if and only if its degree 
 
 
 
  divides 
 
 
 
 .
Curve 
 
 
 
  defined as above is connected precisely when 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are relatively prime (not necessarily pairwise), which is assumed to be the case.
Genus
By the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, genus of a superelliptic curve is given by
