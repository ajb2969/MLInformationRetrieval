Histidine transaminase

In enzymology, a histidine transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-histidine + 2-oxoglutarate 
 
 
 
  (imidazol-5-yl)pyruvate + L-glutamate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-histidine and 2-oxoglutarate, whereas its two products are (imidazol-5-yl)pyruvate and L-glutamate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-histidine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase. Other names in common use include histidine aminotransferase, and histidine-2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase. This enzyme participates in histidine metabolism.
