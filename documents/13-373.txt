   Fraunhofer distance      Fraunhofer distance   The Fraunhofer distance , named after Joseph von Fraunhofer , is the value of:       d  =    2   D  2    位    ,      d      2   superscript  D  2    位     d={{2D^{2}}\over{\lambda}},   where D is the largest dimension of the radiator (or the diameter of the antenna ) and   位   位   {\lambda}   is the wavelength of the radio wave . This distance provides the limit between the near and far field .
