Fraunhofer distance

The Fraunhofer distance, named after Joseph von Fraunhofer, is the value of:


 
  where D is the largest dimension of the radiator (or the diameter of the antenna) and 
 
 
 
  is the wavelength of the radio wave. This distance provides the limit between the near and far field.
