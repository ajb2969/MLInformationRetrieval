Sommerfeld identity

The Sommerfeld identity is a mathematical identity, due Arnold Sommerfeld, used in the theory of propagation of waves,



where


 
  is to be taken with positive real part, to ensure the convergence of the integral and its vanishing in the limit 
 
 
 
  and


 
 . Here, 
 
 
 
  is the distance from the origin while 
 
 
 
  is the distance from the central axis of a cylinder as in the 
 
 
cylindrical coordinate system. The function 
 
 
 
  is a Bessel function. Here the notation for Bessel functions follows the German convention, to be consistent with the original notation used by Sommerfeld. In English literature it is more common to use


 
 .
This identity is known as the Sommerfeld Identity [Ref.1,Pg.242].
An alternative form is


 
  Where



[Ref.2,Pg.66]. The notation used here is different form that above
 
 
 
  is now the distance from the origin and 
 
 
 
  is the axial distance in a cylindrical system defined as 
 
 
 
 .
The physical interpretation is that a spherical wave can be expanded into a summation of cylindrical waves in 
 
 
 
  direction, multiplied by a plane wave in the 
 
 
 
  direction; see the Jacobi-Anger expansion. The summation has to be taken over all the wavenumbers 
 
 
 
 .
