   Sommerfeld identity      Sommerfeld identity   The Sommerfeld identity is a mathematical identity, due Arnold Sommerfeld , used in the theory of propagation of waves,        e   i  k  R    R   =    ∫  0  ∞     I  0    (   λ  r   )    e   -   μ   |  z  |        λ  d  λ   μ            superscript  e    i  k  R    R     superscript   subscript   0        subscript  I  0     λ  r    superscript  e      μ    z          λ  d  λ   μ       \frac{{e^{ikR}}}{R}=\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}I_{0}(\lambda r)e^{-\mu\left|z%
 \right|}\frac{{\lambda d\lambda}}{{\mu}}     where      μ  =     λ  2   -   k  2         μ       superscript  λ  2    superscript  k  2       \mu=\sqrt{\lambda^{2}-k^{2}}   is to be taken with positive real part, to ensure the convergence of the integral and its vanishing in the limit    z  →   ±  ∞      normal-→  z   plus-or-minus      z\rightarrow\pm\infty   and       R  2   =    r  2   +   z  2         superscript  R  2      superscript  r  2    superscript  z  2      R^{2}=r^{2}+z^{2}   . Here,   R   R   R   is the distance from the origin while   r   r   r   is the distance from the central axis of a cylinder as in the    (  r  ,  ϕ  ,  z  )     r  ϕ  z    (r,\phi,z)    cylindrical coordinate system . The function    I  0     subscript  I  0    I_{0}   is a Bessel function . Here the notation for Bessel functions follows the German convention, to be consistent with the original notation used by Sommerfeld. In English literature it is more common to use        I  n    (  ρ  )    =    J  n    (   i  ρ   )           subscript  I  n   ρ      subscript  J  n     i  ρ      I_{n}(\rho)=J_{n}(i\rho)   .  This identity is known as the Sommerfeld Identity [Ref.1,Pg.242].  An alternative form is        e   i   k  0   r    r   =   i    ∫  0  ∞    d   k  ρ     k  ρ    k  z     J  0    (    k  ρ   ρ   )    e   i   k  z    |  z  |               superscript  e    i   subscript  k  0   r    r     i    superscript   subscript   0       d   subscript  k  ρ      subscript  k  ρ    subscript  k  z     subscript  J  0      subscript  k  ρ   ρ    superscript  e    i   subscript  k  z     z          \frac{{e^{ik_{0}r}}}{r}=i\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}{dk_{\rho}\frac{{k_{\rho}}}{{%
 k_{z}}}J_{0}(k_{\rho}\rho)e^{ik_{z}\left|z\right|}}   Where       k  z   =    (    k  0  2   -   k  ρ  2    )    1  /  2         subscript  k  z    superscript     superscript   subscript  k  0   2    superscript   subscript  k  ρ   2      1  2      k_{z}=(k_{0}^{2}-k_{\rho}^{2})^{1/2}     [Ref.2,Pg.66]. The notation used here is different form that above   r   r   r   is now the distance from the origin and   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the axial distance in a cylindrical system defined as    (  ρ  ,  ϕ  ,  z  )     ρ  ϕ  z    (\rho,\phi,z)   .  The physical interpretation is that a spherical wave can be expanded into a summation of cylindrical waves in   ρ   ρ   \rho   direction, multiplied by a plane wave in the   z   z   z   direction; see the Jacobi-Anger expansion . The summation has to be taken over all the wavenumbers    k  ρ     subscript  k  ρ    k_{\rho}   .
