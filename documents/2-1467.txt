   Lemniscate of Bernoulli      Lemniscate of Bernoulli   In geometry , the lemniscate of Bernoulli is a plane curve defined from two given points F 1 and F 2 , known as foci , at distance 2 a from each other as the locus of points P so that PF 1 · PF 2 = a 2 . The curve has a shape similar to the numeral 8 and to the ∞ symbol. Its name is from lemniscus , which is Latin for "pendant ribbon". It is a special case of the Cassini oval and is a rational algebraic curve of degree 4.  This lemniscate was first described in 1694 by Jakob Bernoulli as a modification of an ellipse , which is the locus of points for which the sum of the distances to each of two fixed focal points is a constant . A Cassini oval , by contrast, is the locus of points for which the product of these distances is constant. In the case where the curve passes through the point midway between the foci, the oval is a lemniscate of Bernoulli.  This curve can be obtained as the inverse transform of a hyperbola , with the inversion circle centered at the center of the hyperbola (bisector of its two foci). It may also be drawn by a mechanical linkage in the form of Watt's linkage , with the lengths of the three bars of the linkage and the distance between its endpoints chosen to form a crossed square . 1  Equations   Its Cartesian  equation is (up to translation and rotation):         (    x  2   +   y  2    )   2   =   2   a  2    (    x  2   -   y  2    )         superscript     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    2     2   superscript  a  2      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2       (x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}=2a^{2}(x^{2}-y^{2})\,      In polar coordinates :        r  2   =   2   a  2    cos   2   θ           superscript  r  2     2   superscript  a  2       2  θ       r^{2}=2a^{2}\cos 2\theta\,      As parametric equation :        x  =    a   2    cos   (  t  )        sin  2    (  t  )    +  1     ;   y  =    a   2    cos   (  t  )     sin   (  t  )        sin  2    (  t  )    +  1        formulae-sequence    x      a    2     t        superscript   2   t   1       y      a    2     t     t        superscript   2   t   1       x=\frac{a\sqrt{2}\cos(t)}{\sin^{2}(t)+1};\qquad y=\frac{a\sqrt{2}\cos(t)\sin(t%

Around 1800, the elliptic functions inverting those integrals were studied by C. F. Gauss (largely unpublished at the time, but allusions in the notes to his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae ). The period lattices are of a very special form, being proportional to the Gaussian integers . For this reason the case of elliptic functions with complex multiplication by the square root of minus one is called the lemniscatic case in some sources.  Applications  Dynamics on this curve and its more generalized versions are studied in quasi-one-dimensional models  See also   Lemniscate of Booth  Lemniscate of Gerono  Gauss's constant  Lemniscatic elliptic function   Notes  References     External links    "Lemniscate of Bernoulli" at The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive  "Lemniscate de Bernoulli" at Encyclopédie des Formes Mathématiques Remarquables (in French)  Coup d'œil sur la lemniscate de Bernoulli (in French)   "  Category:Curves  Category:Algebraic curves  Category:Spiric sections     . ↩
