Elongated pentagonal gyrobicupola

In geometry, the elongated pentagonal gyrobicupola is one of the Johnson solids (J39). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a pentagonal gyrobicupola (J31) by inserting a decagonal prism between its congruent halves. Rotating one of the pentagonal cupolae (J5) through 36Â degrees before inserting the prism yields an elongated pentagonal orthobicupola (J38).
Formulae
The following formulae for volume and surface area can be used if all faces are regular, with edge length a:1
