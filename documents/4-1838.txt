   Graded vector space      Graded vector space   In mathematics , a graded vector space is a vector space that has the extra structure of a grading or a gradation , which is a decomposition of the vector space into a direct sum of vector subspaces.  ℕ-graded vector spaces  Let ℕ be the set of non-negative integers. An ℕ-graded vector space , often called simply a graded vector space without the prefix ℕ, is a vector space V which decomposes into a direct sum of the form      V  =    ⊕   n  ∈  ℕ     V  n        V    subscript  direct-sum    n  ℕ     subscript  V  n      V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb{N}}V_{n}   where each    V  n     subscript  V  n    V_{n}   is a vector space. For a given n the elements of    V  n     subscript  V  n    V_{n}   are then called homogeneous elements of degree n .  Graded vector spaces are common. For example the set of all polynomials in one or several variables forms a graded vector space, where the homogeneous elements of degree n are exactly the linear combinations of monomials of degree n .  General I -graded vector spaces  The subspaces of a graded vector space need not be indexed by the set of natural numbers, and may be indexed by the elements of any set I . An I -graded vector space V is a vector space that can be written as a direct sum of subspaces indexed by elements i of set I :       V  =    ⊕   i  ∈  I     V  i     .      V    subscript  direct-sum    i  I     subscript  V  i      V=\bigoplus_{i\in I}V_{i}.     Therefore, an   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   -graded vector space, as defined above, is just an I -graded vector space where the set I is   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   (the set of natural numbers ).  The case where I is the ring      ℤ  /  2   ℤ        ℤ  2   ℤ    \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}   (the elements 0 and 1) is particularly important in physics . A    (    ℤ  /  2   ℤ   )        ℤ  2   ℤ    (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})   -graded vector space is also known as a supervector space .  Homomorphisms  For general index sets I , a linear map between two I -graded vector spaces f : V → W is called a graded linear map if it preserves the grading of homogeneous elements. A graded linear map is also called a homomorphism (or morphism ) of graded vector spaces, or homogeneous linear map :       f   (   V  i   )    ⊆   W  i         f   subscript  V  i     subscript  W  i     f(V_{i})\subseteq W_{i}   for all i in I .  For a fixed field and a fixed index set, the graded vector spaces form a category whose morphisms are the graded linear maps.  When I is a commutative monoid (such as the natural numbers ), then one may more generally define linear maps that are homogeneous of any degree i in I by the property       f   (   V  j   )    ⊆   W   i  +  j          f   subscript  V  j     subscript  W    i  j      f(V_{j})\subseteq W_{i+j}   for all j in I ,  where "+" denotes the monoid operation. If moreover I satisfies the cancellation property so that it can be embedded into a commutative group A which it generates (for instance the integers if I is the natural numbers), then one may also define linear maps that are homogeneous of degree i in A by the same property (but now "+" denotes the group operation in A ). In particular for i in I a linear map will be homogeneous of degree − i if       f   (   V   i  +  j    )    ⊆   W  j         f   subscript  V    i  j      subscript  W  j     f(V_{i+j})\subseteq W_{j}   for all j in I , while       f   (   V  j   )    =   0         f   subscript  V  j    0    f(V_{j})=0\,   if j − i is not in I .  Just as the set of linear maps from a vector space to itself forms an associative algebra (the algebra of endomorphisms of the vector space), the sets of homogeneous linear maps from a space to itself, either restricting degrees to I or allowing any degrees in the group A , form associative graded algebras over those index sets.  Operations on graded vector spaces  Some operations on vector spaces can be defined for graded vector spaces as well.  Given two I -graded vector spaces V and W , their direct sum has underlying vector space V ⊕ W with gradation   ( V ⊕ W ) i = V i ⊕ W i .   If I is a semigroup , then the tensor product of two I -graded vector spaces V and W is another I -graded vector space,    V  ⊗  W     tensor-product  V  W    V\otimes W   with gradation         (   V  ⊗  W   )   i   =    ⊕   {   j  ,  k   |    j  +  k   =  i   }      V  j   ⊗   W  k      .       subscript   tensor-product  V  W   i     subscript  direct-sum   conditional-set   j  k       j  k   i      tensor-product   subscript  V  j    subscript  W  k       (V\otimes W)_{i}=\bigoplus_{\{j,k|j+k=i\}}V_{j}\otimes W_{k}.
