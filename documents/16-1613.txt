   Method of continued fractions      Method of continued fractions   The method of continued fractions is a method developed specifically for solution of integral equations of quantum scattering theory like Lippmann-Schwinger equation or Faddeev equations . It was invented by Horáček and Sasakawa 1 in 1983. The goal of the method is to solve the integral equation       |  ψ  ⟩   =    |  ϕ  ⟩   +    G  0   V   |  ψ  ⟩          ket  ψ      ket  ϕ      subscript  G  0   V   ket  ψ       |\psi\rangle=|\phi\rangle+G_{0}V|\psi\rangle   iteratively and to construct convergent continued fraction for the T-matrix       T  =   ⟨  ϕ  |  V  |  ψ  ⟩    .      T   quantum-operator-product  ϕ  V  ψ     T=\langle\phi|V|\psi\rangle.   The method has two variants. In the first one (denoted as MCFV) we construct approximations of the potential energy operator   V   V   V   in the form of separable function of rank 1, 2, 3 ... The second variant (MCFG method 2 ) constructs the finite rank approximations to Green's operator . The approximations are constructed within Krylov subspace constructed from vector    |  ϕ  ⟩     ket  ϕ    |\phi\rangle   with action of the operator    A  =    G  0   V       A     subscript  G  0   V     A=G_{0}V   . The method can thus be understood as resummation of (in general divergent) Born series by Padé approximants . It is also closely related to Schwinger variational principle . In general the method requires similar amount of numerical work as calculation of terms of Born series, but it provides much faster convergence of the results.  Algorithm of MCFV  The derivation of the method proceeds as follows. First we introduce rank-one (separable) approximation to the potential       V  =     V   |  ϕ  ⟩    ⟨  ϕ  |   V    ⟨  ϕ  |  V  |  ϕ  ⟩    +   V  1     .      V        V   ket  ϕ    bra  ϕ   V    quantum-operator-product  ϕ  V  ϕ     subscript  V  1      V=\frac{V|\phi\rangle\langle\phi|V}{\langle\phi|V|\phi\rangle}+V_{1}.   The integral equation for the rank-one part of potential is easily soluble. The full solution of the original problem can therefore be expressed as         |  ψ  ⟩   =    |  ϕ  ⟩   +    T   ⟨  ϕ  |  V  |  ϕ  ⟩     |   ψ  1   ⟩      ,   T  =     ⟨  ϕ  |  V  |  ϕ  ⟩   2     ⟨  ϕ  |  V  |  ϕ  ⟩   -   ⟨  ϕ  |  V  |   ψ  1   ⟩       ,     formulae-sequence     ket  ψ      ket  ϕ       T   quantum-operator-product  ϕ  V  ϕ     ket   subscript  ψ  1         T     superscript   quantum-operator-product  ϕ  V  ϕ   2      quantum-operator-product  ϕ  V  ϕ    quantum-operator-product  ϕ  V   subscript  ψ  1         |\psi\rangle=|\phi\rangle+\frac{T}{\langle\phi|V|\phi\rangle}|\psi_{1}\rangle,%
 \qquad T=\frac{\langle\phi|V|\phi\rangle^{2}}{\langle\phi|V|\phi\rangle-%
 \langle\phi|V|\psi_{1}\rangle},   in terms of new function    |   ψ  1   ⟩     ket   subscript  ψ  1     |\psi_{1}\rangle   . This function is solution of modified Lippmann-Schwinger equation        |   ψ  1   ⟩   =    |   ϕ  1   ⟩   +    G  0    V  1    |   ψ  1   ⟩      ,       ket   subscript  ψ  1       ket   subscript  ϕ  1       subscript  G  0    subscript  V  1    ket   subscript  ψ  1        |\psi_{1}\rangle=|\phi_{1}\rangle+G_{0}V_{1}|\psi_{1}\rangle,   with      |   ϕ  1   ⟩   =    G  0   V   |  ϕ  ⟩     .       ket   subscript  ϕ  1       subscript  G  0   V   ket  ϕ      |\phi_{1}\rangle=G_{0}V|\phi\rangle.   The remainder potential term    V  1     subscript  V  1    V_{1}   is transparent for incoming wave         V  1    |  ϕ  ⟩    =    ⟨  ϕ  |    V  1    =  0   ,           subscript  V  1    ket  ϕ       bra  ϕ    subscript  V  1         0     V_{1}|\phi\rangle=\langle\phi|V_{1}=0,   i. e. it is weaker operator than the original one. The new problem thus obtained for    |   ψ  1   ⟩     ket   subscript  ψ  1     |\psi_{1}\rangle   is of the same form as the original one and we can repeat the procedure. This lreads to recurrent relations       V  i   =    V   i  -  1    -     V   i  -  1     |   ϕ   i  -  1    ⟩    ⟨   ϕ   i  -  1    |    V   i  -  1      ⟨   ϕ   i  -  1    |   V   i  -  1    |   ϕ   i  -  1    ⟩          subscript  V  i      subscript  V    i  1         subscript  V    i  1     ket   subscript  ϕ    i  1      bra   subscript  ϕ    i  1      subscript  V    i  1      quantum-operator-product   subscript  ϕ    i  1     subscript  V    i  1     subscript  ϕ    i  1         V_{i}=V_{i-1}-\frac{V_{i-1}|\phi_{i-1}\rangle\langle\phi_{i-1}|V_{i-1}}{%
 \langle\phi_{i-1}|V_{i-1}|\phi_{i-1}\rangle}           |   ϕ  i   ⟩   =    G  0    V   i  -  1     |   ϕ   i  -  1    ⟩     .       ket   subscript  ϕ  i       subscript  G  0    subscript  V    i  1     ket   subscript  ϕ    i  1        |\phi_{i}\rangle=G_{0}V_{i-1}|\phi_{i-1}\rangle.   It is possible to show that the T-matrix of the original problem can be expressed in the form of chain fraction       T  =    β  0  2     β  0   -   γ  1   -     β  1  2     β  1   -   γ  2   -     β  2  2     β  2   -   γ  3   -  ⋱           ,      T   continued-fraction   superscript   subscript  β  0   2      subscript  β  0    subscript  γ  1    continued-fraction   superscript   subscript  β  1   2      subscript  β  1    subscript  γ  2    continued-fraction   superscript   subscript  β  2   2      subscript  β  2    subscript  γ  3   normal-⋱          T=\cfrac{\beta_{0}^{2}}{\beta_{0}-\gamma_{1}-\cfrac{\beta_{1}^{2}}{\beta_{1}-%
 \gamma_{2}-\cfrac{\beta_{2}^{2}}{\beta_{2}-\gamma_{3}-\ddots}}},   where we defined         β  i   =   ⟨   ϕ   i  -  1    |   V   i  -  1    |   ϕ   i  -  1    ⟩    ,    γ  i   =   ⟨   ϕ   i  -  1    |   V   i  -  1    |   ϕ  i   ⟩     .     formulae-sequence     subscript  β  i    quantum-operator-product   subscript  ϕ    i  1     subscript  V    i  1     subscript  ϕ    i  1         subscript  γ  i    quantum-operator-product   subscript  ϕ    i  1     subscript  V    i  1     subscript  ϕ  i       \beta_{i}=\langle\phi_{i-1}|V_{i-1}|\phi_{i-1}\rangle,\qquad\gamma_{i}=\langle%
 \phi_{i-1}|V_{i-1}|\phi_{i}\rangle.   In practical calculation the infinite chain fraction is replaced by finite one assuming that        β  N   =   β   N  +  1    =  …  =  0   ,    γ  N   =   γ   N  +  1    =  …  =  0.      formulae-sequence       subscript  β  N    subscript  β    N  1         normal-…       0         subscript  γ  N    subscript  γ    N  1         normal-…       0.      \beta_{N}=\beta_{N+1}=\dots=0,\qquad\gamma_{N}=\gamma_{N+1}=\dots=0.   This is equivalent to assuming that the remainder solution        |   ψ  N   ⟩   =    |   ϕ  N   ⟩   +    G  0    V  N    |   ψ  N   ⟩      ,       ket   subscript  ψ  N       ket   subscript  ϕ  N       subscript  G  0    subscript  V  N    ket   subscript  ψ  N        |\psi_{N}\rangle=|\phi_{N}\rangle+G_{0}V_{N}|\psi_{N}\rangle,   is negligible. This is plausible assumption, since the remainder potential    V  N     subscript  V  N    V_{N}   has all vectors       |   ϕ  i   ⟩   ,  i   =  0   ,   1  ,  …  ,   N  -  1       formulae-sequence      ket   subscript  ϕ  i    i   0    1  normal-…    N  1      |\phi_{i}\rangle,i=0,1,...,N-1   in its null space and it can be shown that this potential converges to zero and the chain fraction converges to the exact T-matrix.  Algorithm of MCFG  The second variant 3 of the method construct the approximations to the Green's operator        G   i  +  1    =    G  i   -     |   ϕ   i  +  1    ⟩    ⟨   ϕ   i  +  1    |     ⟨   ϕ  i   |  V  |   ϕ   i  +  1    ⟩      ,       subscript  G    i  1       subscript  G  i        ket   subscript  ϕ    i  1      bra   subscript  ϕ    i  1       quantum-operator-product   subscript  ϕ  i   V   subscript  ϕ    i  1         G_{i+1}=G_{i}-\frac{|\phi_{i+1}\rangle\langle\phi_{i+1}|}{\langle\phi_{i}|V|%
 \phi_{i+1}\rangle},   now with vectors       |   ϕ   i  +  1    ⟩   =    G  i   V   |   ϕ  i   ⟩         ket   subscript  ϕ    i  1        subscript  G  i   V   ket   subscript  ϕ  i       |\phi_{i+1}\rangle=G_{i}V|\phi_{i}\rangle   . The chain fraction for T-matrix now also holds, with little bit different definition of coefficients     β  i   ,   γ  i       subscript  β  i    subscript  γ  i     \beta_{i},\gamma_{i}   . 4  Properties and relation to other methods  The expressions for the T-matrix resulting from both methods can be related to certain class of variational principles. In the case of first iteration of MCFV method we get the same result as from Schwinger variational principle with trial function     |  ψ  ⟩   =   |  ϕ  ⟩        ket  ψ    ket  ϕ     |\psi\rangle=|\phi\rangle   . The higher iterations with N-terms in the continuous fraction reproduce exactly 2N terms (2N+1) of Born series for the MCFV (or MCFG) method respectively. The method was tested on calculation of collisions of electrons from hydrogen atom in static-exchange approximation. In this case the method reproduces exact results for scattering cross-section on 6 significan digits in 4 iterations. It can also be shown that both methods reproducee exactly the solution of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation with the potential given by finite-rank operator . The number of iterations is then equal to the rank of the potential. The method has been successfully used for solution of problems in both nuclear 5 and molecular physics . 6  References  "  Category:Quantum mechanics  Category:Scattering     Horáček J., Sasakawa T. “Method of continued factions with application to atomic physics”, Phys.
