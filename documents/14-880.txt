Circular law

In probability theory, more specifically the study of random matrices, the circular law describes the distribution of eigenvalues of an 
 
 
random matrix with independent and identically distributed entries in the limit 
 
 
 
 .
It asserts that for any sequence of random 
 
 
 
  matrices whose entries are independent and identically distributed random variables, all with mean zero and variance equal to 
 
 
 
 , the limiting spectral distribution is the uniform distribution over the unit disc.
Precise statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be a sequence of 
 
 
 
  matrix ensembles whose entries are i.i.d. copies of a complex random variable 
 
 
 
  with mean 0 and variance 1. Let 
 
 
 
  denote the eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
 . Define the empirical spectral measure of 
 
 
 
  as


 
 . With these definitions in mind, the circular law asserts the sequence of measures 
 
 
converges in probability to the uniform measure on the unit disk.
History
For random matrices with Gaussian distribution of entries (the Ginibre ensembles), the circular law was established in the 1960s by Jean Ginibre.1 In the 1980s, Vyacheslav Girko introduced2 an approach which allowed to establish the circular law for more general distributions. Further progress was made3 by Zhidong Bai, who established the circular law under certain smoothness assumptions on the distribution.
The assumptions were further relaxed in the works of Terence Tao and Van H. Vu,4 Friedrich Götze and Alexander Tikhomirov.5 Finally, in 2010 Tao and Vu proved6 the circular law under the minimal assumptions stated above.
