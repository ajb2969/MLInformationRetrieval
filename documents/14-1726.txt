   Electrovibration      Electrovibration  The history of '''electrovibration''' goes back to 1954. It was first discovered by accident and [[E. Mallinckrodt]], A. L. Hughes and W. Sleator  Jr. reported “... that dragging a dry finger over a conductive surface covered with a thin insulating layer and excited with a 110 V [volt] signal, created a characteristic rubbery feeling”. Mallinckrodt, E.; Hughes, A. L.; Sleator, W. Jr. "[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/118/3062/277.extract Perception by the Skin of Electrically Induced Vibrations]". (Extract) Science , Vol 118, No. 3062, pp.277-278, 4 September 1953. .

History  "In summer of 1950, E Mallinckrodt noted that a certain shiny brass electric light socket did not feel as smooth when the light was burning as it did with the light off". Then Mallinckrodt created a setup to investigate the effect scientifically. He connected an aluminum plate through a variable current limiting resistor to a 60 Hz, 110v power supply. Half of the aluminum plate was coated with an insulating  varnish while the rest was left uncoated. As a result of the test he identified that the feeling of friction only appears when there is an insulating barrier between the conductive surface and the sliding finger. He concluded that the finger gets electrically polarized and this induced charge creates a force between that finger and the surface. He named this phenomena "Electrically Induced Vibrations". 4  Electrostatic Force Theory  An electrostatic force is created by applying a time varying voltage between an electrode and an insulated ground plane . When a finger scans over an insulated plate with a time varying voltage, the finger works as the induced ground plane. The induced static electricity creates an electric force field between the finger and the surface.  A parallel-plate capacitor model can be used to approximate the skin-surface interface. The electrode acts as one plate, while the conductive subcutaneous layer in the skin acts as the other, thus representing a hybrid natural/artificial electrostatic actuator. 5 The following equation approximates the electrostatic force experienced between the finger and the electrode.       F  e   =     ε  0    ε  r   A   V  2     2   d  2          subscript  F  normal-e        subscript  ε  0    subscript  ε  r   A   superscript  V  2      2   superscript  d  2       F_{\mathrm{e}}=\frac{\varepsilon_{0}\varepsilon_{r}AV^{2}}{2d^{2}}     where,      ε  0     subscript  ε  0    \varepsilon_{0}   : permittivity of free space      ε  r     subscript  ε  r    \varepsilon_{r}   : dielectric constant     A   A   A   : area of electrodes     V   V   V   : voltage applied between the two plates     d   d   d   : distance between two plates  The resulting force is too small to perceive by human skin, but when the finger is moving on the surface a frictional force appears on the moving finger, which can be expressed as:      f  =   μ   F  e        f    μ   subscript  F  normal-e      f=\mu F_{\mathrm{e}}     where,     μ   μ   \mu   : coefficient of friction.  Further research has shown that this model is not sufficient to explain such skin-surface interfaces. 6  Perception of electrostatic friction  Electrovibration as a modality  References  "  Category:Electricity  Category:Sensory receptors     Senseg ↩  Bau,  Olivier;  Israr,  Ali;  Poupyrev,  Ivan;  Harrison,  Chris;  Baskinger,  Mark;  May,  Jason  (3  October  2010)  [ http://www.disneyresearch.com/research/projects/hci_teslatouch_drp.htm?v=y&rnd; ;=1316790008655  Electrostatic  Vibration]  (formerly  “TeslaTouch”) ,  Disney  Research ,  Retrieved  7  June  2015 ↩   (Free  download,  4.2  MB) ↩   Agarwal, A.K.; Nammi, K.; Kaczmarek, K.A.; Tyler, M.E.; Beebe, D.J.
