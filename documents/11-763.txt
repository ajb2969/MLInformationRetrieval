N-malonylurea hydrolase

In enzymology, a N-malonylurea hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-oxo-3-ureidopropanoate + H2O 
 
 
 
  malonate + urea
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-oxo-3-ureidopropanoate and H2O, whereas its two products are malonate and urea.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-oxo-3-ureidopropanoate amidohydrolase (urea- and malonate-forming). This enzyme is also called ureidomalonase.
