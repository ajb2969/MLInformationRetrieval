   Linear matrix inequality      Linear matrix inequality   In convex optimization , a linear matrix inequality ( LMI ) is an expression of the form       LMI   (  y  )    :=    A  0   +    y  1    A  1    +    y  2    A  2    +  ‚ãØ  +    y  m    A  m     ‚â•   0        assign   LMI  y      subscript  A  0      subscript  y  1    subscript  A  1       subscript  y  2    subscript  A  2    normal-‚ãØ     subscript  y  m    subscript  A  m          0     \operatorname{LMI}(y):=A_{0}+y_{1}A_{1}+y_{2}A_{2}+\cdots+y_{m}A_{m}\geq 0\,   where       y  =   [    y  i    ,   i   =  1  ,  ‚Ä¶  ,  m  ]      fragments  y    fragments  normal-[   subscript  y  i   normal-,  i   1  normal-,  normal-‚Ä¶  normal-,  m  normal-]     y=[y_{i}\,,~{}i\!=\!1,\dots,m]   is a real vector,       A  0   ,   A  1   ,   A  2   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   A  m       subscript  A  0    subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  A  m     A_{0},A_{1},A_{2},\dots,A_{m}   are    n  √ó  n      n  n    n\times n    symmetric matrices     ùïä  n     superscript  ùïä  n    \mathbb{S}^{n}   ,      B  ‚â•  0      B  0    B\geq 0   is a generalized inequality meaning   B   B   B   is a positive semidefinite matrix belonging to the positive semidefinite cone    ùïä  +     subscript  ùïä     \mathbb{S}_{+}   in the subspace of symmetric matrices   ùïä   ùïä   \mathbb{S}   .   This linear matrix inequality specifies a convex constraint on y .  Applications  There are efficient numerical methods to determine whether an LMI is feasible ( e.g. , whether there exists a vector y such that LMI( y )¬†‚â•¬†0), or to solve a convex optimization problem with LMI constraints. Many optimization problems in control theory , system identification and signal processing can be formulated using LMIs. Also LMIs find application in Polynomial Sum-Of-Squares . The prototypical primal and dual semidefinite program is a minimization of a real linear function respectively subject to the primal and dual convex cones governing this LMI.  Solving LMIs  A major breakthrough in convex optimization lies in the introduction of interior-point methods . These methods were developed in a series of papers and became of true interest in the context of LMI problems in the work of Yurii Nesterov and Arkadii Nemirovskii.  References   Y. Nesterov and A.
