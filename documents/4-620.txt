   Post's theorem      Post's theorem   In computability theory  Post's theorem , named after Emil Post , describes the connection between the arithmetical hierarchy and the Turing degrees .  Background  The statement of Post's theorem uses several concepts relating to definability and recursion theory . This section gives a brief overview of these concepts, which are covered in depth in their respective articles.  The arithmetical hierarchy classifies certain sets of natural numbers that are definable in the language of Peano arithmetic. A formula is said to be    Σ  m  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   m    \Sigma^{0}_{m}   if it is an existential statement in prenex normal form (all quantifiers at the front) with   m   m   m   alternations between existential and universal quantifiers applied to a quantifier free formula. Formally a formula    ϕ   (  s  )       ϕ  s    \phi(s)   in the language of Peano arithmetic is a    Σ  m  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   m    \Sigma^{0}_{m}   formula if it is of the form       ∃    n  1    ∀    n  2    ∃    n  3    ∀    n  4   ⋯  Q   n  m   ρ   (   n  1   ,  …  ,   n  m   ,   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  k   )           ,         subscript  n  1    for-all     subscript  n  2        subscript  n  3    for-all     subscript  n  4   normal-⋯  Q   subscript  n  m   ρ    subscript  n  1   normal-…   subscript  n  m    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  k             \exists n_{1}\forall n_{2}\exists n_{3}\forall n_{4}\cdots Qn_{m}\rho(n_{1},%
 \ldots,n_{m},x_{1},\ldots,x_{k}),   where ρ is a quantifier free formula and Q is   ∀   for-all   \forall   if m is even and   ∃     \exists   if m is odd. Note that any formula of the form       (   ∃    n  1  1    ∃    n  2  1   ⋯   ∃   n   j  1   1        )    (   ∀    n  1  2   ⋯   ∀   n   j  2   2      )    (   ∃    n  1  3   ⋯    )   ⋯   (    Q  1    n  1  m   ⋯   )   ρ   (   n  1  1   ,   …   n   j  m   m    ,   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  k   )            subscript   superscript  n  1   1        subscript   superscript  n  1   2   normal-⋯     subscript   superscript  n  1    subscript  j  1          for-all     subscript   superscript  n  2   1   normal-⋯   for-all   subscript   superscript  n  2    subscript  j  2            subscript   superscript  n  3   1   normal-⋯    normal-⋯     subscript  Q  1    subscript   superscript  n  m   1   normal-⋯   ρ    subscript   superscript  n  1   1     normal-…   subscript   superscript  n  m    subscript  j  m      subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  k      \left(\exists n^{1}_{1}\exists n^{1}_{2}\cdots\exists n^{1}_{j_{1}}\right)%
 \left(\forall n^{2}_{1}\cdots\forall n^{2}_{j_{2}}\right)\left(\exists n^{3}_{%
 1}\cdots\right)\cdots\left(Q_{1}n^{m}_{1}\cdots\right)\rho(n^{1}_{1},\ldots n^%
 {m}_{j_{m}},x_{1},\ldots,x_{k})   where   ρ   ρ   \rho   contains only bounded quantifiers is provably equivalent to a formula of the above form from the axioms of Peano arithmetic . Thus it isn't uncommon to see    Σ  m  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   m    \Sigma^{0}_{m}   formulas defined in this alternative and technically nonequivalent manner since in practice the distinction is rarely important.  A set of natural numbers A is said to be    Σ  m  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   m    \Sigma^{0}_{m}   if it is definable by a    Σ  m  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   m    \Sigma^{0}_{m}   formula, that is, if there is a    Σ  m  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   m    \Sigma^{0}_{m}   formula    ϕ   (  s  )       ϕ  s    \phi(s)   such that each number n is in A if and only if    ϕ   (  n  )       ϕ  n    \phi(n)   holds. It is known that if a set is    Σ  m  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   m    \Sigma^{0}_{m}   then it is    Σ  n  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   n    \Sigma^{0}_{n}   for any    n  >  m      n  m    n>m   , but for each m there is a    Σ   m  +  1   0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0     m  1     \Sigma^{0}_{m+1}   set that is not    Σ  m  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   m    \Sigma^{0}_{m}   . Thus the number of quantifier alternations required to define a set gives a measure of the complexity of the set.  Post's theorem uses the relativized arithmetical hierarchy as well as the unrelativized hierarchy just defined. A set A of natural numbers is said to be    Σ  m  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   m    \Sigma^{0}_{m}   relative to a set B , written    Σ  m   0  ,  B      subscript   superscript  normal-Σ   0  B    m    \Sigma^{0,B}_{m}   , if A is definable by a    Σ  m  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   m    \Sigma^{0}_{m}   formula in an extended language that includes a predicate for membership in B .  While the arithmetical hierarchy measures definability of sets of natural numbers, Turing degrees measure the level of uncomputability of sets of natural numbers. A set A is said to be Turing reducible to a set B , written    A   ≤  T   B      subscript   T   A  B    A\leq_{T}B   , if there is an oracle Turing machine that, given an oracle for B , computes the characteristic function of A . The Turing jump of a set A is a form of the Halting problem relative to A . Given a set A , the Turing jump    A  ′     superscript  A  normal-′    A^{\prime}   is the set of indices of oracle Turing machines that halt on input 0 when run with oracle A . It is known that every set A is Turing reducible to its Turing jump, but the Turing jump of a set is never Turing reducible to the original set.  Post's theorem uses finitely iterated Turing jumps. For any set A of natural numbers, the notation    A   (  n  )      superscript  A  n    A^{(n)}   indicates the n -fold iterated Turing jump of A . Thus    A   (  0  )      superscript  A  0    A^{(0)}   is just A , and    A   (   n  +  1   )      superscript  A    n  1     A^{(n+1)}   is the Turing jump of    A   (  n  )      superscript  A  n    A^{(n)}   .  Post's theorem and corollaries  Post's theorem establishes a close connection between the arithmetical hierarchy and the Turing degrees of the form    ∅   (  n  )      superscript   n    \emptyset^{(n)}   , that is, finitely iterated Turing jumps of the empty set. (The empty set could be replaced with any other computable set without changing the truth of the theorem.)  Post's theorem states:   A set B is    Σ   n  +  1   0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0     n  1     \Sigma^{0}_{n+1}   if and only if   B   B   B   is recursively enumerable by an oracle Turing machine with an oracle for    ∅   (  n  )      superscript   n    \emptyset^{(n)}   , that is, if and only if B is    Σ  1   0  ,   ∅   (  n  )        subscript   superscript  normal-Σ   0   superscript   n     1    \Sigma^{0,\emptyset^{(n)}}_{1}   .  The set    ∅   (  n  )      superscript   n    \emptyset^{(n)}   is    Σ  n  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   n    \Sigma^{0}_{n}   complete for every    n  >  0      n  0    n>0   . This means that every    Σ  n  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   n    \Sigma^{0}_{n}   set is many-one reducible to    ∅   (  n  )      superscript   n    \emptyset^{(n)}   .   Post's theorem has many corollaries that expose additional relationships between the arithmetical hierarchy and the Turing degrees. These include:   Fix a set C . A set B is    Σ   n  +  1    0  ,  C      subscript   superscript  normal-Σ   0  C      n  1     \Sigma^{0,C}_{n+1}   if and only if B is    Σ  1   0  ,   C   (  n  )        subscript   superscript  normal-Σ   0   superscript  C  n     1    \Sigma^{0,C^{(n)}}_{1}   . This is the relativization of the first part of Post's theorem to the oracle C .  A set B is    Δ   n  +  1      subscript  normal-Δ    n  1     \Delta_{n+1}   if and only if    B   ≤  T    ∅   (  n  )        subscript   T   B   superscript   n     B\leq_{T}\emptyset^{(n)}   . More generally, B is    Δ   n  +  1   C     subscript   superscript  normal-Δ  C     n  1     \Delta^{C}_{n+1}   if and only if    B   ≤  T    C   (  n  )        subscript   T   B   superscript  C  n     B\leq_{T}C^{(n)}   .  A set is defined to be arithmetical if it is    Σ  n  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   n    \Sigma^{0}_{n}   for some n . Post's theorem shows that, equivalently, a set is arithmetical if and only if it is Turing reducible to    ∅   (  m  )      superscript   m    \emptyset^{(m)}   for some m .   References  Rogers, H.
