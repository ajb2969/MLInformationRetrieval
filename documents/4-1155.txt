   Associator      Associator   In abstract algebra , the term associator is used in different ways as a measure of the nonassociativity of an algebraic structure.  Ring theory  For a nonassociative ring or algebra    R   R   R   , the associator is the multilinear map      [  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ]   :    R  ×  R  ×  R   →  R      normal-:   normal-⋅  normal-⋅  normal-⋅    normal-→    R  R  R   R     [\cdot,\cdot,\cdot]:R\times R\times R\to R   given by        [  x  ,  y  ,  z  ]   =     (   x  y   )   z   -   x   (   y  z   )      .       x  y  z         x  y   z     x    y  z       [x,y,z]=(xy)z-x(yz).\,     Just as the commutator measures the degree of noncommutativity , the associator measures the degree of nonassociativity of   R   R   R   . It is identically zero for an associative ring or algebra.  The associator in any ring obeys the identity         w   [  x  ,  y  ,  z  ]    +    [  w  ,  x  ,  y  ]   z    =     [   w  x   ,  y  ,  z  ]   -   [  w  ,   x  y   ,  z  ]    +   [  w  ,  x  ,   y  z   ]     .          w   x  y  z       w  x  y   z           w  x   y  z    w    x  y   z     w  x    y  z       w[x,y,z]+[w,x,y]z=[wx,y,z]-[w,xy,z]+[w,x,yz].\,     The associator is alternating precisely when   R   R   R   is an alternative ring .  The associator is symmetric in its two rightmost arguments when   R   R   R   is a pre-Lie algebra .  The nucleus is the set of elements that associate with all others: that is, the n in R such that        [  n  ,  R  ,  R  ]   =   [  R  ,  n  ,  R  ]   =   [  R  ,  R  ,  n  ]   =   {  0  }    .         n  R  R    R  n  R         R  R  n         0      [n,R,R]=[R,n,R]=[R,R,n]=\{0\}\ .     It turns out that any two of    (   [  n  ,  R  ,  R  ]   ,   [  R  ,  n  ,  R  ]   ,   [  R  ,  R  ,  n  ]   )      n  R  R    R  n  R    R  R  n     ([n,R,R],[R,n,R],[R,R,n])   being    {  0  }     0    \{0\}   implies that the third is also the zero set.  Quasigroup theory  A quasigroup  Q is a set with a binary operation    ⋅  :  Q  ×  Q  →  Q     fragments  normal-⋅  normal-:  Q   Q  normal-→  Q    \cdot:Q\times Q\to Q   such that for each a,b in Q , the equations     a  ⋅  x   =  b       normal-⋅  a  x   b    a\cdot x=b   and     y  ⋅  a   =  b       normal-⋅  y  a   b    y\cdot a=b   have unique solutions x,y in Q . In a quasigroup Q , the associator is the map     (  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ,  ⋅  )   :    Q  ×  Q  ×  Q   →  Q      normal-:   normal-⋅  normal-⋅  normal-⋅    normal-→    Q  Q  Q   Q     (\cdot,\cdot,\cdot):Q\times Q\times Q\to Q   defined by the equation        (   a  ⋅  b   )   ⋅  c   =    (   a  ⋅   (   b  ⋅  c   )    )   ⋅   (  a  ,  b  ,  c  )         normal-⋅   normal-⋅  a  b   c    normal-⋅   normal-⋅  a   normal-⋅  b  c     a  b  c      (a\cdot b)\cdot c=(a\cdot(b\cdot c))\cdot(a,b,c)     for all a,b,c in Q . As with its ring theory analog, the quasigroup associator is a measure of nonassociativity of Q .  Higher-dimensional algebra  In higher-dimensional algebra , where there may be non-identity morphisms between algebraic expressions, an associator is an isomorphism        a   x  ,  y  ,  z    :     (   x  y   )   z   ↦   x   (   y  z   )      .     normal-:   subscript  a   x  y  z     maps-to      x  y   z     x    y  z       a_{x,y,z}:(xy)z\mapsto x(yz).     Category theory  In category theory , the associator expresses the associative properties of the internal product functor in monoidal categories .
