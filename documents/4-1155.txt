Associator

In abstract algebra, the term associator is used in different ways as a measure of the nonassociativity of an algebraic structure.
Ring theory
For a nonassociative ring or algebra

 
 , the associator is the multilinear map

 
  given by



Just as the commutator measures the degree of noncommutativity, the associator measures the degree of nonassociativity of 
 
 
 
 . It is identically zero for an associative ring or algebra.
The associator in any ring obeys the identity



The associator is alternating precisely when 
 
 
 
  is an alternative ring.
The associator is symmetric in its two rightmost arguments when 
 
 
 
  is a pre-Lie algebra.
The nucleus is the set of elements that associate with all others: that is, the n in R such that



It turns out that any two of 
 
 
 
  being 
 
 
 
  implies that the third is also the zero set.
Quasigroup theory
A quasigroup Q is a set with a binary operation 
 
 
 
  such that for each a,b in Q, the equations 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have unique solutions x,y in Q. In a quasigroup Q, the associator is the map 
 
 
 
  defined by the equation



for all a,b,c in Q. As with its ring theory analog, the quasigroup associator is a measure of nonassociativity of Q.
Higher-dimensional algebra
In higher-dimensional algebra, where there may be non-identity morphisms between algebraic expressions, an associator is an isomorphism



Category theory
In category theory, the associator expresses the associative properties of the internal product functor in monoidal categories.
