   Cayley's Ω process      Cayley's Ω process   In mathematics, Cayley's Ω process , introduced by , is a relatively invariant differential operator on the general linear group , that is used to construct invariants of a group action .  As a partial differential operator acting on functions of n 2 variables x ij , the omega operator is given by the determinant       Ω  =   |       ∂   ∂   x  11        ⋯      ∂   ∂   x   1  n           ⋮    ⋱    ⋮        ∂   ∂   x   n  1         ⋯      ∂   ∂   x   n  n          |    .      normal-Ω            subscript  x  11     normal-⋯        subscript  x    1  n        normal-⋮  normal-⋱  normal-⋮          subscript  x    n  1      normal-⋯        subscript  x    n  n           \Omega=\begin{vmatrix}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{11}}&\cdots&\frac{\partial}{%
 \partial x_{1n}}\\
 \vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\

 vmatrix}.     For binary forms  f in x 1 , y 1 and g in x 2 , y 2 the Ω operator is       ∂  2    f  g      ∂   x  1     ∂   y  2      -     ∂  2    f  g      ∂   x  2     ∂   y  1              superscript   2     f  g         subscript  x  1       subscript  y  2          superscript   2     f  g         subscript  x  2       subscript  y  1        \frac{\partial^{2}fg}{\partial x_{1}\partial y_{2}}-\frac{\partial^{2}fg}{%
 \partial x_{2}\partial y_{1}}   . The r -fold Ω process Ω r ( f , g ) on two forms f and g in the variables x and y is then   Convert f to a form in x 1 , y 1 and g to a form in x 2 , y 2  Apply the Ω operator r times to the function fg , that is, f times g in these four variables  Substitute x for x 1 and x 2 , y for y 1 and y 2 in the result   The result of the r -fold Ω process Ω r ( f , g ) on the two forms f and g is also called the r -th transvectant and is commonly written ( f , g ) r .  Applications  Cayley's Ω process appears in Capelli's identity , which  used to find generators for the invariants of various classical groups acting on natural polynomial algebras.  used Cayley's Ω process in his proof of finite generation of rings of invariants of the general linear group. His use of the Ω process gives an explicit formula for the Reynolds operator of the special linear group.  Cayley's Ω process is used to define transvectants .
