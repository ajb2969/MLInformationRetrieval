UDP-galactopyranose mutase




UDP-galactopyranose mutase

In enzymology, an UDP-galactopyranose mutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-D-galactopyranose 
 
 
 
  UDP-D-galacto-1,4-furanose
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, UDP-D-galactopyranose, and one product, UDP-D-galacto-1,4-furanose.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring other groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-D-galactopyranose furanomutase.
