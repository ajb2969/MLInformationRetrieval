Wehrl entropy

In quantum information theory, the Wehrl entropy,1 named after A. Wehrl, is a type of quasi-entropy defined for the Husimi Q representation

2 of the phase-space quasiprobability distribution. It is defined as



Such a definition of entropy relies on the fact that the Husimi Q representation remains non-negative definite,3 unlike other representations of quantum quasiprobability distributions in phase space.
However, it is not the fully quantum von Neumann entropy in the Husimi representation in phase space, : all the requisite star-products ★ in that entropy have been dropped here. In the Husimi representation, the star products read


 
  and are isomorphic4 to the Moyal products of the Wigner–Weyl representation.
The Wehrl entropy, then, may be thought of as a type of heuristic semiclassical approximation to the full quantum von Neumann entropy, since it retains some 
 
 
 
  dependence (through Q) but not all of it.
Like all entropies, it reflects some measure of non-localization,5 as the Gauss transform involved in generating 
 
 
 
  and the sacrifice of the star operators have effectively discarded information. In general, for the same state, the Wehrl entropy exceeds the von Neumann entropy (which vanishes for pure states).
