   Wehrl entropy      Wehrl entropy   In quantum information theory, the Wehrl entropy , 1 named after A. Wehrl, is a type of quasi- entropy defined for the Husimi Q representation    Q   Q   Q    2 of the phase-space quasiprobability distribution . It is defined as        S  Q   =   -   ∫   Q   (  x  ,  p  )    log  Q    (  x  ,  p  )   d   x   d   p       .       subscript  S  Q         Q   x  p     Q    x  p   d  x  d  p       S_{Q}=-\int Q(x,p)\log Q(x,p)\,dx\,dp~{}.     Such a definition of entropy relies on the fact that the Husimi Q representation remains non-negative definite, 3 unlike other representations of quantum quasiprobability distributions in phase space.  However, it is not the fully quantum von Neumann entropy in the Husimi representation in phase space, : all the requisite star-products ★ in that entropy have been dropped here. In the Husimi representation, the star products read      ⋆  ≡  exp   (   ℏ  2    (    ∂  ←   x   -  i    ∂  ←   p   )    (    ∂  →   x   +  i    ∂  →   p   )   )   ,     fragments  normal-⋆     fragments  normal-(    Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2    fragments  normal-(   subscript   superscript   normal-←   x    i   subscript   superscript   normal-←   p   normal-)    fragments  normal-(   subscript   superscript   normal-→   x    i   subscript   superscript   normal-→   p   normal-)   normal-)   normal-,    \star\equiv\exp\left(\frac{\hbar}{2}({\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\partial}}_{x}-i{%
 \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\partial}}_{p})({\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\partial}}_{x}+i%
 {\stackrel{\rightarrow}{\partial}}_{p})\right)~{},   and are isomorphic 4 to the Moyal products of the Wigner–Weyl representation .  The Wehrl entropy, then, may be thought of as a type of heuristic semiclassical approximation to the full quantum von Neumann entropy, since it retains some   ħ   ħ   ħ   dependence (through Q ) but not all of it .  Like all entropies, it reflects some measure of non-localization, 5 as the Gauss transform involved in generating   Q   Q   Q   and the sacrifice of the star operators have effectively discarded information. In general, for the same state, the Wehrl entropy exceeds the von Neumann entropy (which vanishes for pure states).
