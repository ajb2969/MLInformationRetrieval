   1024 (number)      1024 (number)   1024 is the natural number following 1023 and preceding 1025 .  1024 is a power of two     2  10     superscript  2  10    2^{10}   (2 to the 10th power). 1 It is the lowest power of two requiring four decimal digits, and the lowest power of two containing the digit 0 in its decimal representation (excluding any leading zeroes ).  It is also the square of 32     32  2     superscript  32  2    32^{2}   .  1024 is the smallest number with exactly 11 divisors (but note that there are smaller numbers with more than 11 divisors; e.g., 60 has 12 divisors) .  Approximation to 1000  The neat coincidence that 2 10 is nearly equal to 10 3 provides the basis of a technique of estimating larger powers of 2 in decimal notation. Using 2 10a+b ≈ 2 b 10 3a is fairly accurate for exponents up to about 100. For exponents up to 300, 3a continues to be a good estimate of the number of digits.  For example, 2 53 ≈ 8×10 15 . The actual value is closer to 9×10 15 .  In the case of larger exponents the relationship becomes increasingly more inaccurate with errors exceeding an order of magnitude for    a  ≥  97      a  97    a\geq 97   , for example:        2  1000    10  300         superscript  2  1000    superscript  10  300     \displaystyle\frac{2^{1000}}{10^{300}}     In measuring bytes , 1024 is often used in place of 1000 as the quotients of the units byte , kilobyte , megabyte , etc. In 1999, the IEC coined the term kibibyte for multiples of 1024, with kilobyte being used for multiples of 1000. However, this convention was never widely adopted. 2  Special use in computers  In binary notation , 1024 is represented as 10000000000, making it a simple round number occurring frequently in computer applications.  1024 is the maximum number of computer memory addresses that can be referenced with ten binary switches . This is the origin of the organization of computer memory into 1024-byte chunks or kibibytes .  In the Rich Text Format (RTF), language code 1024 indicates the text is not in any language and should be skipped over when proofing . Most used languages codes in RTF are integers slightly over 1024.  1024× 768 pixels and 1280 ×1024 pixels are common standards of display resolution .
