Caldesmon-phosphatase

In enzymology, a caldesmon-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

caldesmon phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  caldesmon + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are caldesmon phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are caldesmon and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is caldesmon-phosphate phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include SMP-I, and smooth muscle caldesmon phosphatase.
