Kubo formula

The Kubo Formula is an equation which expresses the linear response of an observable quantity due to a time-dependent perturbation. Among the numerous applications of linear response formula, one can mention charge and spin susceptibilities of, for instance, electron systems due to external electric or magnetic fields. Responses to external mechanical forces or vibrations can also be calculated using the very same formula.
The general Kubo formula
Consider a quantum system described by the (time independent) Hamiltonian 
 
 
 
 . The expectation value of a physical quantity, described by the operator 
 
 
 
 , can be evaluated as:











where 
 
 
 
  is the partition function. Suppose now that just above some time 
 
 
 
  an external perturbation is applied to the system. The perturbation is described by an additional time dependence in the Hamiltonian
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Heaviside function ( = 1 for positive times, =0 otherwise) and 
 
 
 
  is hermitian and defined for all t, so that 
 
 
 
  has for positive 
 
 
 
  again a complete set of real eigenvalues 
 
 
 
  But these eigenvalues may change with time.
However, we can again find the time evolution of the density matrix

 
  rsp. of the partition function 
 
 
 
  to evaluate the expectation value of 
 
 

 The time dependence of the states 
 
 
 
  is governed by the Schrödinger equation

 
  which thus determines everything, corresponding of course to the Schrödinger picture. But since 
 
 
 
  is to be regarded as a small perturbation, it is convenient to now use instead the interaction picture representation, 
 
 
 
  in lowest nontrivial order. The time dependence in this representation is given by 
 
 
 
  where by definition for all t and 
 
 
 
  it is
 
 

To linear order in 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
 . Thus one obtains the expectation value of 
 
 
 
  up to linear order in the perturbation.






\langle \hat{A}(t)\rangle &=& \langle \hat{A}\rangle_0-i\int_{t_0}^t dt'{1\over Z_0}\sum_n e^{-\beta E_n} \langle n (t_0)| \hat{A}(t)\hat{V}(t')- \hat{V}(t')\hat{A}(t) |n(t_0) \rangle\\ &=& \langle \hat{A}\rangle_0-i\int_{t_0}^t dt'\langle [\hat{A}(t),\hat{V}(t')]\rangle_0 \end{array}  The brackets 
 
 
 
  mean an equilibrium average with respect to the Hamiltonian 
 
 
 
  Therefore, although the result is of first order in the perturbation, it involves only the zeroth-order eigenfunctions, which is usually the case in perturbation theory and moves away all complications which otherwise might arise for 
 
 
 
 .
Here we have used an example, where the operators are bosonic operators, while for fermionic operators, the retarded functions are defined with anti-communtators instead of the usual (see Second quantization)1
