Correlation swap

A correlation swap is an over-the-counter financial derivative that allows one to speculate on or hedge risks associated with the observed average correlation, of a collection of underlying products, where each product has periodically observable prices, as with a commodity, exchange rate, interest rate, or stock index.
Payoff Definition
The fixed leg of a correlation swap pays the notional 
 
 
 
  times the agreed strike 
 
 
 
 , while the floating leg pays the realized correlation 
 
 
 
 . The contract value at expiration from the pay-fixed perspective is therefore



Given a set of nonnegative weights 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  securities, the realized correlation is defined as the weighted average of all pairwise correlation coefficients 
 
 
 
 :


 
  Typically 
 
 
 
  would be calculated as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the daily log-returns of assets i and j, possibly under zero-mean assumption.
Most correlation swaps trade using equal weights, in which case the realized correlation formula simplifies to:



Pricing and valuation
No industry-standard models yet exist that have stochastic correlation and are arbitrage-free.
