   Correlation swap      Correlation swap   A correlation swap is an over-the-counter  financial derivative that allows one to speculate on or hedge  risks associated with the observed average correlation , of a collection of underlying products, where each product has periodically observable prices, as with a commodity , exchange rate , interest rate , or stock index .  Payoff Definition  The fixed leg of a correlation swap pays the notional    N  corr     subscript  N  corr    N_{\text{corr}}   times the agreed strike    ρ  strike     subscript  ρ  strike    \rho_{\text{strike}}   , while the floating leg pays the realized correlation    ρ  realized     subscript  ρ  realized    \rho_{\text{realized }}   . The contract value at expiration from the pay-fixed perspective is therefore       N  corr    (    ρ  realized   -   ρ  strike    )        subscript  N  corr      subscript  ρ  realized    subscript  ρ  strike      N_{\text{corr}}(\rho_{\text{realized}}-\rho_{\text{strike}})     Given a set of nonnegative weights    w  i     subscript  w  i    w_{i}   on   n   n   n   securities, the realized correlation is defined as the weighted average of all pairwise correlation coefficients    ρ   i  ,  j      subscript  ρ   i  j     \rho_{i,j}   :       ρ  realized   :=     ∑   i  ≠  j      w  i    w  j    ρ   i  ,  j        ∑   i  ≠  j      w  i    w  j         assign   subscript  ρ  realized       subscript     i  j       subscript  w  i    subscript  w  j    subscript  ρ   i  j        subscript     i  j       subscript  w  i    subscript  w  j        \rho_{\text{realized }}:=\frac{\sum_{i\neq j}{w_{i}w_{j}\rho_{i,j}}}{\sum_{i%
 \neq j}{w_{i}w_{j}}}   Typically    ρ   i  ,  j      subscript  ρ   i  j     \rho_{i,j}   would be calculated as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the daily log-returns of assets i and j , possibly under zero-mean assumption.  Most correlation swaps trade using equal weights, in which case the realized correlation formula simplifies to:       ρ  realized   =    2   n   (   n  -  1   )       ∑   i  <  j     ρ   i  ,  j           subscript  ρ  realized       2    n    n  1       subscript     i  j     subscript  ρ   i  j        \rho_{\text{realized }}=\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\sum_{i     Pricing and valuation  No industry-standard models yet exist that have stochastic correlation and are arbitrage -free.
