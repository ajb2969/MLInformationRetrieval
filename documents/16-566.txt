Symmetric spectrum

In algebraic topology, a symmetric spectrum X is a spectrum of pointed simplicial sets that comes with an action of the symmetric group

 
  on 
 
 
 
  such that the composition of structure maps


 
  is equivariant with respect to 
 
 
 
 . A morphism between symmetric spectra is a morphism of spectra that is equivariant with respect to the actions of symmetric groups.
The technical advantage of the category 
 
 
 
  of symmetric spectra is that it has a closed symmetric monoidal structure (with respect to smash product). It is also a simplicial model category. A symmetric ring spectrum is a monoid in 
 
 
 
 ; if the monoid is commutative, it's a commutative ring spectrum. The possibility of this definition of "ring spectrum" was one of motivations behind the category.
A similar technical goal is also achieved by May's theory of S-modules, a competing theory.
