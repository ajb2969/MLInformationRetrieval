   Symmetric spectrum      Symmetric spectrum   In algebraic topology, a symmetric spectrum  X is a spectrum of pointed simplicial sets that comes with an action of the symmetric group     Σ  n     subscript  normal-Σ  n    \Sigma_{n}   on    X  n     subscript  X  n    X_{n}   such that the composition of structure maps        S  1   ∧  …  ∧   S  1   ∧   X  n    →    S  1   ∧  …  ∧   S  1   ∧   X   n  +  1     →  …  →    S  1   ∧   X    n  +  p   -  1     →   X   n  +  p         normal-→     superscript  S  1   normal-…   superscript  S  1    subscript  X  n       superscript  S  1   normal-…   superscript  S  1    subscript  X    n  1       normal-→    normal-…    normal-→       superscript  S  1    subscript  X      n  p   1       normal-→     subscript  X    n  p       S^{1}\wedge\dots\wedge S^{1}\wedge X_{n}\to S^{1}\wedge\dots\wedge S^{1}\wedge

 _{n+1}\to\dots\to S^{1}\wedge X_{n+p-1}\to X_{n+p}   is equivariant with respect to     Σ  p   ×   Σ  n        subscript  normal-Σ  p    subscript  normal-Σ  n     \Sigma_{p}\times\Sigma_{n}   . A morphism between symmetric spectra is a morphism of spectra that is equivariant with respect to the actions of symmetric groups.  The technical advantage of the category    𝒮   p  Σ       𝒮   superscript  p  normal-Σ     \mathcal{S}p^{\Sigma}   of symmetric spectra is that it has a closed symmetric  monoidal structure (with respect to smash product ). It is also a simplicial model category . A symmetric ring spectrum is a monoid in    𝒮   p  Σ       𝒮   superscript  p  normal-Σ     \mathcal{S}p^{\Sigma}   ; if the monoid is commutative, it's a commutative ring spectrum . The possibility of this definition of "ring spectrum" was one of motivations behind the category.  A similar technical goal is also achieved by May's theory of S-modules , a competing theory.
