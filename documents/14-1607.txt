   Hilbert–Burch theorem      Hilbert–Burch theorem   In mathematics , the Hilbert–Burch theorem describes the structure of some free resolutions of a quotient of a local or graded  ring in the case that the quotient has projective dimension 2.  proved a version of this theorem for polynomial rings , and  proved a more general version. Several other authors later rediscovered and published variations of this theorem.  gives a statement and proof.  Statement  If R is a local ring with an ideal  I and      0  →   R  m   →   R  n   →  R  →   R  /  I   →  0       normal-→  0   superscript  R  m     normal-→     superscript  R  n     normal-→    R    normal-→      R  I     normal-→    0     0\rightarrow R^{m}\rightarrow R^{n}\rightarrow R\rightarrow R/I\rightarrow 0   is a free resolution of the R - module  R / I , then m = n – 1 and the ideal I is aJ where a is a non zero divisor of R and J is the depth 2 ideal generated by the determinants of the minors of size m of the matrix of the map from R m to R n .
