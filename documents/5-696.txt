   Nome (mathematics)      Nome (mathematics)   In mathematics , specifically the theory of elliptic functions , the nome is a special function and is given by      q  =   e   -    π   K  ′    K     =   e    i  π   ω  2     ω  1     =    e   i  π  τ           q   superscript  e        π   superscript  K  normal-′    K           superscript  e      normal-i  π   subscript  ω  2     subscript  ω  1           superscript  e    normal-i  π  τ       q=e^{-\frac{\pi K^{\prime}}{K}}=e^{\frac{{\rm{i}}\pi\omega_{2}}{\omega_{1}}}=e%
 ^{{\rm{i}}\pi\tau}\,   where K and i K ′ are the quarter periods , and ω 1 and ω 2 are the fundamental pair of periods . Notationally, the quarter periods K and i K ′ are usually used only in the context of the Jacobian elliptic functions , whereas the half-periods ω 1 and ω 2 are usually used only in the context of Weierstrass elliptic functions . Some authors, notably Apostol, use ω 1 and ω 2 to denote whole periods rather than half-periods.  The nome is frequently used as a value with which elliptic functions and modular forms can be described; on the other hand, it can also be thought of as function, because the quarter periods are functions of the elliptic modulus . This ambiguity occurs because for real values of the elliptic modulus, the quarter periods and thus the nome are uniquely determined.  The function τ = i K ′/ K = ω 1 /ω 2 is sometimes called the half-period ratio because it is the ratio of the two half-periods ω 1 and ω 2 of an elliptic function.  The complementary nome  q 1 is given by        q  1   =   e   -    π  K    K  ′       .       subscript  q  1    superscript  e        π  K    superscript  K  normal-′        q_{1}=e^{-\frac{\pi K}{K^{\prime}}}.\,     See the articles on quarter period and elliptic integrals for additional definitions and relations on the nome.
