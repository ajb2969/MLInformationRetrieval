X–Y–Z matrix

In mathematics, an X–Y–Z matrix is a generalization of the concept of matrix to three dimensions.
An X–Y–Z matrix 
 
 
 
  will thus have components 
 
 
 
  where



for some positive integers 
 
 

Such matrices are helpful for example when considering grids in three dimensions, as in computer simulations of three-dimensional problems.
