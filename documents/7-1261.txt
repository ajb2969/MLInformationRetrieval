   X–Y–Z matrix      X–Y–Z matrix   In mathematics , an X–Y–Z matrix is a generalization of the concept of matrix to three dimensions.  An X–Y–Z matrix   A   A   A   will thus have components    A   i  ,  j  ,  k      subscript  A   i  j  k     A_{i,j,k}   where       1  ≤  i  ≤  M   ,   1  ≤  j  ≤  N   ,   1  ≤  k  ≤  P      formulae-sequence      1  i       M        1  j       N        1  k       P      1\leq i\leq M,\ 1\leq j\leq N,\ 1\leq k\leq P     for some positive integers     M  ,  N  ,  P   .     M  N  P    M,N,P.     Such matrices are helpful for example when considering grids in three dimensions, as in computer simulations of three-dimensional problems.
