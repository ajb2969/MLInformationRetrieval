   Baer–Specker group      Baer–Specker group   In mathematics , in the field of group theory , the Baer–Specker group , or Specker group , named after Reinhold Baer and Ernst Specker , is an example of an infinite Abelian group which is a building block in the structure theory of such groups.  Definition  The Baer–Specker group is the group B = Z N of all integer sequences with componentwise addition, that is, the direct product of countably many copies of Z .  Properties  Reinhold Baer proved in 1937 that this group is not  free abelian ; Specker proved in 1950 that every countable subgroup of B  is free abelian.  The group of homomorphisms from the Baer–Specker group to a free abelian group of finite rank is a free abelian group of countable rank. This provides another proof that the group is not free. 1  See also   Slender group   Notes  References    .   .   .   .

They write it in the form     P  *   ≅  S       superscript  P    S    P^{*}\cong S   where   P   P   P   denotes the Baer-Specker group, the star operator gives the dual group of homomorphisms to   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   , and   S   S   S   is the free abelian group of countable rank. They continue, "It follows that   P   P   P   has no direct summand isomorphic to   S   S   S   ", from which an immediate consequence is that   P   P   P   is not free abelian. ↩
