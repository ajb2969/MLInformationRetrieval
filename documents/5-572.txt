   Velocity-addition formula      Velocity-addition formula   In relativistic physics , a velocity-addition formula is an equation that relates the velocities of objects in different reference frames . It is  in nature. It also relates different frames, that is, the formulas applies to successive Lorentz transformations . Accompanying velocity addition is a kinematic effect called the Thomas precession . Successive non-collinear Lorentz boosts affects a rotation to the coordinate system. This topic is treated in the linked article.  Standard applications of the velocity-addition formulas include the Doppler shift , Doppler navigation , the Aberration of light and the dragging of light in moving water observed in the 1851 Fizeau experiment . 1  History  The speed of light in the fluid is slower than the speed of light in vacuum, and it changes if the fluid is moving along with the light. In 1851, Fizeau  measured the speed of light in a fluid moving parallel to the light using a Michelson interferometer . Fizeau's results were not in accord with the then prevalent theories. Fizeau experimentally correctly determined the zeroth term of an expansion of the relativistically correct addition law in terms of    V  /  c      V  c    {V}/{c}   as is described below. Fizeau's result led physicists to accept the empirical validity of the rather unsatisfactory theory by Fresnel that a fluid moving with respect to the stationary aether partially drags light with it, i.e. the speed is instead of    c  +  V      c  V    c+V   , where   c   c   c   is the speed of light in the aether, and   V   V   V   is the speed of the fluid with respect to the aether.  The aberration of light , which easiest explanation is the relativistic velocity addition formula, together with Fizeau's result provoked the development of theories like Lorentz aether theory of electromagnetism in 1892. It was only with the advent of special relativity in 1905 that the issues involving aether were, gradually over the years, settled.  Galilean relativity  As Galileo observed, if a ship is moving relative to the shore at velocity v , and a fly is moving with velocity u as measured on the ship, calculating the velocity of the fly as measured on the shore is what is meant by the addition of the velocities v and u . When both the fly and the ship are moving slowly compared to light, it is accurate enough to use the vector sum       ùê¨  =   ùêØ  +  ùêÆ    ,      ùê¨    ùêØ  ùêÆ     \mathbf{s}=\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u},     where s is the velocity of the fly relative to the shore.  The cosmos of Galileo consists of absolute space and time and the addition of velocities corresponds to composition of Galilean transformations .  Special relativity  According to the theory of special relativity , the frame of the ship has a different clock rate and distance measure, and the notion of simultaneity in the direction of motion is altered, so the addition law for velocities is changed. This change is not noticeable at low velocities but as the velocity increases towards the speed of light it becomes important. The addition law is also called a composition law for velocities . For collinear motions, the velocity of the fly relative to the shore is given by       s  =    v  +  u    1  +   (    v  u   /   c  2    )      .      s      v  u     1      v  u    superscript  c  2        s={v+u\over 1+(vu/c^{2})}.     The composition formula can take an algebraically equivalent form, which can be easily derived by using only the principle of constancy of the speed of light: 2         c  -  s    c  +  s    =    (    c  -  u    c  +  u    )    (    c  -  v    c  +  v    )     .          c  s     c  s          c  u     c  u        c  v     c  v       {c-s\over c+s}=\left({c-u\over c+u}\right)\left({c-v\over c+v}\right).     Standard configuration  The formulas for boosts in the standard configuration follow most straightforwardly from taking differentials of the inverse Lorentz boost in standard configuration, 3 4         d  x   =    Œ≥  V    (    d   x  ‚Ä≤    +   v  d   t  ‚Ä≤     )     ,     d  y   =   d   y  ‚Ä≤     ,     d  z   =   d   z  ‚Ä≤     ,    d  t   =    Œ≥  V    (    d   t  ‚Ä≤    +    V   c  2    d   x  ‚Ä≤     )        .     formulae-sequence      d  x      subscript  Œ≥  V       d   superscript  x  normal-‚Ä≤      v  d   superscript  t  normal-‚Ä≤        formulae-sequence      d  y     d   superscript  y  normal-‚Ä≤      formulae-sequence      d  z     d   superscript  z  normal-‚Ä≤         d  t      subscript  Œ≥  V       d   superscript  t  normal-‚Ä≤        V   superscript  c  2    d   superscript  x  normal-‚Ä≤           dx=\gamma_{V}(dx^{\prime}+vdt^{\prime}),\quad dy=dy^{\prime},\quad dz=dz^{%

There are other more involved proofs that may be more enlightening, such as the one below.  Since a relativistic transformation rotates space and time into each other much as geometric rotations in the plane rotate the   x   x   x   - and   y   y   y   -axes, it is convenient to use the same units for space and time, otherwise a unit conversion factor appears throughout relativistic formulae, being the speed of light . In a system where lengths and times are measured in the same units, the speed of light is dimensionless and equal to   1   1   1   . A velocity is then expressed as fraction of the speed of light.  To find the relativistic transformation law, it is useful to introduce the four-velocities ( V 0 , V 1 , 0, 0)}} and ( U 0 , U 1 , U 2 , U 3 )}} . The four-velocity is defined to be a four-vector with relativistic length equal to   1   1   1   , future-directed and tangent to the world line of the object in spacetime. Here, corresponds to the time component and to the   x   x   x   component of the fly's four-velocity as seen by the ship. It is convenient to take the   x   x   x   -axis to be the direction of motion of the ship, and the   y   y   y   -axis so that the    x  ‚Äì  y      x  normal-‚Äì  y    x‚Äìy   plane is the plane spanned by the motion of the ship and the fly. This results in several components of the velocities being zero;  V 3 {{=}} U 3 {{=}} 0}} .  The ordinary velocity is the ratio of the rate at which the space coordinates are increasing to the rate at which the time coordinate is increasing,     ùêØ   ùêØ   \displaystyle\mathbf{v}     Since the relativistic length of   V   V   V   is   1   1   1   ,         V  0  2   -   V  1  2    =  1   ,         superscript   subscript  V  0   2    superscript   subscript  V  1   2    1    V_{0}^{2}-V_{1}^{2}=1,   so         V  0   =   1  /     1  -   v  1  2        ,    V  1   =    v  1   /    1  -   v  1  2        .     formulae-sequence     subscript  V  0     1      1   superscript   subscript  v  1   2          subscript  V  1      subscript  v  1       1   superscript   subscript  v  1   2         V_{0}=1/\sqrt{1-v_{1}^{2}}\ ,\quad V_{1}=v_{1}/\sqrt{1-v_{1}^{2}}.     The Lorentz transformation matrix that boosts the rest frame to four-velocity   V   V   V   is then       (      V  0      V  1     0    0       V  1      V  0     0    0      0    0    1    0      0    0    0    1     )   .       subscript  V  0    subscript  V  1   0  0     subscript  V  1    subscript  V  0   0  0    0  0  1  0    0  0  0  1     \begin{pmatrix}V_{0}&V;_{1}&0&0\\
 V_{1}&V;_{0}&0&0\\

 0&0&0&1\end{pmatrix}.     This matrix rotates the a pure time-axis vector    (  1  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  )     1  0  0  0    (1,0,0,0)   to , and all its columns are relativistically orthogonal to one another, so it defines a Lorentz transformation.  If a fly is moving with four-velocity   U   U   U   in the rest frame, and it is boosted by multiplying by the matrix above, the new four-velocity is ( S 0 , S 1 , S 2 , S 3 )}} ,      S  0     subscript  S  0    \displaystyle S_{0}     Dividing by the time component and substituting for the components of the four-vectors   U   U   U   and   V   V   V   in terms of the components of the three-vectors   ùêÆ   ùêÆ   \mathbf{u}   and   ùêØ   ùêØ   \mathbf{v}   gives the relativistic composition law as      s  1     subscript  s  1    \displaystyle s_{1}     The form of the relativistic composition law can be understood as an effect of the failure of simultaneity at a distance. For the parallel component, the time dilation decreases the speed, the length contraction increases it, and the two effects cancel out. The failure of simultaneity means that the fly is changing simultaneity slices as the projection of   ùêÆ   ùêÆ   \mathbf{u}   onto   ùêØ   ùêØ   \mathbf{v}   . Since this effect is entirely due to the time slicing, the same factor multiplies the perpendicular component, but for the perpendicular component there is no length contraction, so the time dilation multiplies by a factor of }} .

Relativistic Doppler shift    Here velocity components will be used as opposed to speed for greater generality, and in order to avoid perhaps seemingly ad hoc introductions of minus signs. Minus signs occurring here will instead serve to illuminate features when speeds less than that of light are considered.  For light waves in vacuum, time dilation together with a simple geometrical observation alone suffices to calculate the Doppler shift in standard configuration (collinear relative velocity of emitter and observer as well of observed light wave).  All velocities in what follows are parallel to the common positive , so subscripts on velocity components are dropped. In the observers frame, introduce the geometrical observation      Œª  =    -   s  T    +   V  T    =    (    -  s   +  V   )   T         Œª        s  T      V  T               s   V   T      \lambda=-sT+VT=(-s+V)T     as the spatial distance, or wavelength , between two pulses (wave crests), where   T   T   T   is the time elapsed between the emission of two pulses. The time elapsed between the passage of two pulses at the same point in space is the time period    œÑ   œÑ   œÑ   , and its inverse    ŒΩ  =   1  /  œÑ       ŒΩ    1  œÑ     ŒΩ={1}/{œÑ}   is the observed (temporal) frequency . The corresponding quantities in the emitters frame are endowed with primes. 13  For light waves       s  =   s  ‚Ä≤   =   -  c    ,        s   superscript  s  normal-‚Ä≤          c      s=s^{\prime}=-c,     and the observed frequency is 14 15       ŒΩ  =    -  s   Œª   =    -  s     (   V  -  s   )   T    =   c    (   V  +  c   )    Œ≥  V    T  ‚Ä≤     =    ŒΩ  ‚Ä≤     c    1  -    V  2    c  2        c  +  V     =    ŒΩ  ‚Ä≤       1  -  Œ≤    1  +  Œ≤        .

Suppose instead that the wave is not composed of light waves with speed   c   c   c   , but instead, for easy visualization, bullets fired from a relativistic machine gun, with velocity    s  ‚Ä≤      s  normal-‚Ä≤    s‚Ä≤   in the frame of the emitter. Then, in general, the geometrical observation is precisely the same . But now,    s  ‚Ä≤  ‚â†  s      s  normal-‚Ä≤  normal-‚â†  s    s‚Ä≤‚â†s   , and   s   s   s   is given by velocity addition,       s  =     s  ‚Ä≤   +  V    1  +     s  ‚Ä≤   V    c  2       .      s       superscript  s  normal-‚Ä≤   V     1       superscript  s  normal-‚Ä≤   V    superscript  c  2        s=\frac{s^{\prime}+V}{1+{s^{\prime}V\over c^{2}}}.

The formula has general validity though. Note that    s  ‚Ä≤      s  normal-‚Ä≤    s‚Ä≤   is negative in the sense for which that the problem is set up, i.e. emitter with positive velocity fires fast bullets towards observer in unprimed system. The convention is that     ‚àí  s   >  V        normal-‚àí  s   V    ‚àís>V   should yield positive frequency in accordance with the the result for the ultimate velocity,    s  =   ‚àí  c       s    normal-‚àí  c     s=‚àíc   . Hence the minus sign is a convention, but a very natural convention, to the point of being canonical.  The formula may also result in negative frequencies. The interpretation then is that the bullets are approaching from the negative   x   x   x   -axis. This may have two causes. The emitter can have large positive velocity and be firing slow bullets. It can also be the case that the emitter has small negative velocity and is firing fast bullets. But if the emitter has a large negative velocity and is firing slow bullets, the frequency is again positive.  For some of these combination to make sense, it must be required that the emitter has been firing bullets for sufficiently long time, in the limit that the   x   x   x   -axis at any instant has equally spaced bullets everywhere.  When     s  ‚Ä≤   =   ‚àí  c         s  normal-‚Ä≤     normal-‚àí  c     s‚Ä≤=‚àíc   , the formula reduces to the formula calculated directly for light waves above,       ŒΩ  =    ŒΩ  ‚Ä≤    Œ≥  V    (   1  -  Œ≤   )    =    ŒΩ  ‚Ä≤     1  -  Œ≤      1  -  Œ≤      1  +  Œ≤       =    ŒΩ  ‚Ä≤       1  -  Œ≤    1  +  Œ≤        .        ŒΩ     superscript  ŒΩ  normal-‚Ä≤    subscript  Œ≥  V     1  Œ≤            superscript  ŒΩ  normal-‚Ä≤       1  Œ≤         1  Œ≤        1  Œ≤               superscript  ŒΩ  normal-‚Ä≤         1  Œ≤     1  Œ≤         \nu=\nu^{\prime}\gamma_{V}(1-\beta)=\nu^{\prime}\frac{1-\beta}{\sqrt{1-\beta}%
 \sqrt{1+\beta}}=\nu^{\prime}\sqrt{\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}\,.     If the emitter is not firing bullets in empty space, but emitting waves in a medium, then the formula still applies , but now, it may be necessary to first calculate    s  ‚Ä≤      s  normal-‚Ä≤    s‚Ä≤   from the velocity of the emitter relative to the medium.  Returning to the case of a light emitter, in the case the observer and emitter are not collinear, but still traveling in straight lines with uniform relative velocity, the result has little modification: 16 17      ŒΩ  =    Œ≥  V    ŒΩ  ‚Ä≤    (   1  +    V   s  ‚Ä≤     cos  Œ∏     )        ŒΩ     subscript  Œ≥  V    superscript  ŒΩ  normal-‚Ä≤     1      V   superscript  s  normal-‚Ä≤      Œ∏        \nu=\gamma_{V}\nu^{\prime}\left(1+\frac{V}{s^{\prime}}\cos\theta\right)     where   Œ∏   Œ∏   Œ∏   is the angle between the light emitter and the observer. This reduces to the previous result for collinear motion when    Œ∏  =  0      Œ∏  0    Œ∏=0   , but for transverse motion corresponding to    Œ∏  =   œÄ  /  2       Œ∏    œÄ  2     Œ∏=œÄ/2   , the frequency is shifted by the Lorentz factor . This does not happen in the classical optical Doppler effect.  Hyperbolic geometry  The addition law on collinear form is also the law of addition of hyperbolic tangents       tanh   (   a  +  b   )    =     tanh  a   +   tanh  b     1  +    tanh  a    tanh  b              a  b          a     b      1      a     b        \tanh(a+b)={\tanh a+\tanh b\over 1+\tanh a\tanh b}     where         v  c   =   tanh   a     ,     u  c   =   tanh   b     ,    s  c   =   tanh   (   a  +  b   )       ,     formulae-sequence      v  c     a     formulae-sequence      u  c     b        s  c       a  b        {v\over c}=\tanh a\ ,\quad{u\over c}=\tanh b\ ,\quad\,{s\over c}=\tanh(a+b),     which shows that the composition of collinear velocities is associative and commutative.  The quantities   b   b   b   and   b   b   b   (equal to the artanh of the velocities divided by   c   c   c   ) are known as rapidities . The reason that the velocities are hyperbolic tangents is because the Lorentz transformation can be thought of as the application of a hyperbolic rotation through a hyperbolic angle which is the rapidity . Suppose the velocity of a line in space-time is the slope of the line, which is the hyperbolic tangent of the rapidity, just as the slope of the   x   x   x   -axis after a rotation is given by the tangent of the rotation angle. When a plane is successively rotated by two angles, the final rotation is by the sum of the two angles. So the final slope of the   x   x   x   -axis is the tangent of the sum of the two angles. In the same way, the slope of the time axis after two boosts is the hyperbolic tangent of the sum of the two rapidities.  The   a   a   a   and   a   a   a   of above can be thought of as being the radial coordinate on a 3-dimensional subspace with spherical coordinates , or the norm of a cartesian vector, of the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group spanned by the boost generators.
