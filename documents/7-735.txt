   Musical isomorphism      Musical isomorphism   In mathematics , the musical isomorphism (or canonical isomorphism ) is an isomorphism between the tangent bundle     T  M      T  M    TM   and the cotangent bundle  of a Riemannian manifold given by its metric . There are similar isomorphisms on symplectic manifolds . The term musical refers to the use of the symbols ♭ and ♯. 1  It is also known as raising and lowering indices .  Discussion  Let    (  M  ,  g  )     M  g    (M,g)   be a Riemannian manifold . Suppose is a local frame for the tangent bundle    T  M      T  M    TM   with dual coframe Then, locally, we may express the Riemannian metric (which is a   2   2   2   -covariant tensor field which is symmetric and positive-definite) as  g ij dx i ⊗ dx j }} (where we employ the Einstein summation convention ). Given a vector field  X i ∂ i }} we define its flat by        X  ♭   :=    g   i  j      X  i    d   x  j    =     X  j    d   x  j     .       assign   superscript  X  normal-♭      subscript  g    i  j     superscript  X  i   d   superscript  x  j            subscript  X  j   d   superscript  x  j       X^{\flat}:=g_{ij}X^{i}\,dx^{j}=X_{j}\,dx^{j}.     This is referred to as "lowering an index". Using the traditional diamond bracket notation for inner product defined by   g   g   g   , we obtain the somewhat more transparent relation        X  ♭    (  Y  )    =   ⟨  X  ,  Y  ⟩          superscript  X  normal-♭   Y    X  Y     X^{\flat}(Y)=\langle X,Y\rangle     for all vectors   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   .  Alternatively, given a covector field  ω i  dx i }} we define its sharp by       ω  ♯   :=    g   i  j     ω  i    ∂  j    =    ω  j    ∂  j         assign   superscript  ω  normal-♯      superscript  g    i  j     subscript  ω  i    subscript   j            superscript  ω  j    subscript   j       \omega^{\sharp}:=g^{ij}\omega_{i}\partial_{j}=\omega^{j}\partial_{j}     where are the elements of the inverse matrix to . Taking the sharp of a covector field is referred to as "raising an index". In inner product notation, this reads        ⟨   ω  ♯   ,  Y  ⟩   =   ω   (  Y  )     ,        superscript  ω  normal-♯   Y     ω  Y     \left\langle\omega^{\sharp},Y\right\rangle=\omega(Y),     for   ω   ω   ω   an arbitrary covector and   Y   Y   Y   an arbitrary vector.  Through this construction we have two inverse isomorphisms       ♭  :    T  M   →     T  *   M   ,  ♯    :     T  *   M   →   T  M     .       normal-:  normal-♭   normal-→    T  M       superscript  T    M   normal-♯      normal-:     normal-→     superscript  T    M     T  M       \flat:TM\to T^{*}M,\qquad\sharp:T^{*}M\to TM.     These are isomorphisms of vector bundles and hence we have, for each   p   p   p   in   M   M   M   , inverse vector space isomorphisms between and    T  M      T  M    TM   .  The musical isomorphisms may also be extended to the bundles         ⊗  k    T  M    ,    ⊗  k     T  *   M     .       superscript  tensor-product  k     T  M      superscript  tensor-product  k      superscript  T    M      \bigotimes^{k}TM,\qquad\bigotimes^{k}T^{*}M.     It must be stated which index is to be raised or lowered. For instance, consider the    (  2  ,  0  )     2  0    (2,0)   tensor field  X ij dx i ⊗ dx j }} . Raising the second index, we get the    (  1  ,  1  )     1  1    (1,1)   tensor field        X  ♯   =     g   j  k      X   i  j     d   x  i    ⊗   ∂  k     .       superscript  X  normal-♯    tensor-product     superscript  g    j  k     subscript  X    i  j    d   superscript  x  i     subscript   k      X^{\sharp}=g^{jk}X_{ij}\,dx^{i}\otimes\partial_{k}.     Trace of a tensor through a metric  Given a    (  0  ,  2  )     0  2    (0,2)   tensor field  X ij dx i ⊗ dx j }} , we define the trace of   X   X   X   through the metric   g   g   g   by         tr  g    (  X  )    :=   tr   (   X  ♯   )    =   tr   (    g   j  k     X   i  j     )    =    g   j  i     X   i  j     =    g   i  j     X   i  j      .       assign    subscript  tr  g   X    tr   superscript  X  normal-♯          tr     superscript  g    j  k     subscript  X    i  j              superscript  g    j  i     subscript  X    i  j             superscript  g    i  j     subscript  X    i  j        \operatorname{tr}_{g}(X):=\operatorname{tr}(X^{\sharp})=\operatorname{tr}(g^{%
 jk}X_{ij})=g^{ji}X_{ij}=g^{ij}X_{ij}.     Observe that the definition of trace is independent of the choice of index we raise since the metric tensor is symmetric.
