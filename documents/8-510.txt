   Fidelity of quantum states      Fidelity of quantum states   In quantum information theory , fidelity is a measure of the "closeness" of two quantum states. It is not a metric on the space of density matrices , but it can be used to define the Bures metric on this space.  Motivation  Given two random variables X , Y with values (1...n) and probabilities p = ( p 1 ... p n ) and q = ( q 1 ... q n ). The fidelity of X and Y is defined to be the quantity       F   (  X  ,  Y  )    =    ∑  i      p  i    q  i            F   X  Y      subscript   i        subscript  p  i    subscript  q  i        F(X,Y)=\sum_{i}\sqrt{p_{i}q_{i}}   .  The fidelity deals with the marginal distribution of the random variables. It says nothing about the joint distribution of those variables. In other words, the fidelity F(X,Y) is the inner product of    (    p  1    ,  ⋯  ,    p  n    )        subscript  p  1    normal-⋯     subscript  p  n      (\sqrt{p_{1}},\cdots,\sqrt{p_{n}})   and    (    q  1    ,  ⋯  ,    q  n    )        subscript  q  1    normal-⋯     subscript  q  n      (\sqrt{q_{1}},\cdots,\sqrt{q_{n}})   viewed as vectors in Euclidean space. Notice that F(X,Y) = 1 if and only if p = q . In general,    0  ≤   F   (  X  ,  Y  )    ≤  1        0    F   X  Y         1     0\leq F(X,Y)\leq 1   . This measure is known as the Bhattacharyya coefficient .  Given a classical measure of the distinguishability of two probability distributions, one can motivate a measure of distinguishability of two quantum states as follows. If an experimenter is attempting to determine whether a quantum state is either of two possibilities   ρ   ρ   \rho   or   σ   σ   \sigma   , the most general possible measurement he can make on the state is a POVM , which is described by a set of Hermitian  positive semidefinite  operators     {   F  i   }      subscript  F  i     \{F_{i}\}   . If the state given to the experimenter is   ρ   ρ   \rho   , he will witness outcome   i   i   i   with probability     p  i   =   Tr   [   ρ   F  i    ]         subscript  p  i     Tr   delimited-[]    ρ   subscript  F  i        p_{i}=\mathrm{Tr}[\rho F_{i}]   , and likewise with probability     q  i   =   Tr   [   σ   F  i    ]         subscript  q  i     Tr   delimited-[]    σ   subscript  F  i        q_{i}=\mathrm{Tr}[\sigma F_{i}]   for   σ   σ   \sigma   . His ability to distinguish between the quantum states   ρ   ρ   \rho   and   σ   σ   \sigma   is then equivalent to his ability to distinguish between the classical probability distributions   p   p   p   and   q   q   q   . Naturally, the experimenter will choose the best POVM he can find, so this motivates defining the quantum fidelity as the Bhattacharyya coefficient when extremized over all possible POVMs    {   F  i   }      subscript  F  i     \{F_{i}\}   :       F   (  ρ  ,  σ  )    =     min   {   F  i   }    F    (  X  ,  Y  )          F   ρ  σ        subscript     subscript  F  i     F    X  Y      F(\rho,\sigma)=\min_{\{F_{i}\}}F(X,Y)   .         =    min   {   F  i   }      ∑  i     Tr   [   ρ   F  i    ]   Tr   [   σ   F  i    ]           absent     subscript     subscript  F  i       subscript   i       Tr   delimited-[]    ρ   subscript  F  i     Tr   delimited-[]    σ   subscript  F  i           =\min_{\{F_{i}\}}\sum_{i}\sqrt{\mathrm{Tr}[\rho F_{i}]\mathrm{Tr}[\sigma F_{i}]}   .     It was shown by Fuchs and Caves that this manifestly symmetric definition is equivalent to the simple asymmetric formula given in the next section. 1  Definition  Given two density matrices ρ and σ , the fidelity is defined by        F   (  ρ  ,  σ  )    =   Tr   [     ρ   σ   ρ     ]     .        F   ρ  σ     Tr        ρ   σ    ρ        F(\rho,\sigma)=\operatorname{Tr}\left[\sqrt{\sqrt{\rho}\sigma\sqrt{\rho}}%
 \right].     By M ½ of a positive semidefinite matrix M , we mean its unique positive square root given by the spectral theorem . The Euclidean inner product from the classical definition is replaced by the Hilbert–Schmidt  inner product . When the states are classical, i.e. when ρ and σ commute, the definition coincides with that for probability distributions.  An equivalent definition is given by        F   (  ρ  ,  σ  )    =    ∥    ρ    σ    ∥   tr    ,        F   ρ  σ     subscript   norm      ρ     σ     tr     F(\rho,\sigma)=\lVert\sqrt{\rho}\sqrt{\sigma}\rVert_{\mathrm{tr}},   where the norm is the trace norm (sum of the singular values). This definition has the advantage that it clearly shows that the fidelity is symmetric in its two arguments.  Notice by definition F is non-negative, and F(ρ,ρ) = 1. In the following section it will be shown that it can be no larger than 1.  In the original 1994 paper of Jozsa the name 'fidelity' was used for the quantity      F   ′   =   F  2        superscript  F  normal-′    superscript  F  2     F\;^{\prime}=F^{2}   and this convention is often used in the literature. According to this convention 'fidelity' has a meaning of probability.  Simple examples  Pure states  Suppose that one of the states is pure    ρ  =    |  ϕ  ⟩    ⟨  ϕ  |        ρ     ket  ϕ    bra  ϕ      \rho=|\phi\rangle\langle\phi|   . Then     ρ   =  ρ  =    |  ϕ  ⟩    ⟨  ϕ  |            ρ   ρ          ket  ϕ    bra  ϕ       \sqrt{\rho}=\rho=|\phi\rangle\langle\phi|   and the fidelity is        F   (  ρ  ,  σ  )    =   Tr   [     |  ϕ  ⟩    ⟨  ϕ  |  σ  |  ϕ  ⟩    ⟨  ϕ  |     ]    =     ⟨  ϕ  |  σ  |  ϕ  ⟩     Tr   [     |  ϕ  ⟩    ⟨  ϕ  |     ]     =    ⟨  ϕ  |  σ  |  ϕ  ⟩     .          F   ρ  σ     Tr       ket  ϕ    quantum-operator-product  ϕ  σ  ϕ    bra  ϕ                quantum-operator-product  ϕ  σ  ϕ     Tr       ket  ϕ    bra  ϕ               quantum-operator-product  ϕ  σ  ϕ       F(\rho,\sigma)=\operatorname{Tr}\left[\sqrt{|\phi\rangle\langle\phi|\sigma|%
 \phi\rangle\langle\phi|}\right]=\sqrt{\langle\phi|\sigma|\phi\rangle}%
 \operatorname{Tr}\left[\sqrt{|\phi\rangle\langle\phi|}\right]=\sqrt{\langle%
 \phi|\sigma|\phi\rangle}.     If the other state is also pure,    σ  =    |  ψ  ⟩    ⟨  ψ  |        σ     ket  ψ    bra  ψ      \sigma=|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|   , then the fidelity is        F   (  ρ  ,  σ  )    =     ⟨  ϕ  |  ψ  ⟩    ⟨  ψ  |  ϕ  ⟩     =   |   ⟨  ϕ  |  ψ  ⟩   |    .          F   ρ  σ         inner-product  ϕ  ψ    inner-product  ψ  ϕ             inner-product  ϕ  ψ       F(\rho,\sigma)=\sqrt{\langle\phi|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\phi\rangle}=|\langle%
 \phi|\psi\rangle|.     This is sometimes called the overlap between two states. If, say,    |  ϕ  ⟩     ket  ϕ    |\phi\rangle   is an eigenstate of an observable, and the system is prepared in    |  ψ  ⟩     ket  ψ    |\psi\rangle   , then F(ρ, σ) 2 is the probability of the system being in state    |  ϕ  ⟩     ket  ϕ    |\phi\rangle   after the measurement.  Commuting states  Let ρ and σ be two density matrices that commute. Therefore they can be simultaneously diagonalized by unitary matrices, and we can write      ρ  =    ∑  i     p  i    |  i  ⟩    ⟨  i  |         ρ    subscript   i      subscript  p  i    ket  i    bra  i       \rho=\sum_{i}p_{i}|i\rangle\langle i|   and    σ  =    ∑  i     q  i    |  i  ⟩    ⟨  i  |         σ    subscript   i      subscript  q  i    ket  i    bra  i       \sigma=\sum_{i}q_{i}|i\rangle\langle i|     for some orthonormal basis    {   |  i  ⟩   }      ket  i     \{|i\rangle\}   . Direct calculation shows the fidelity is        F   (  ρ  ,  σ  )    =    ∑  i      p  i    q  i       .        F   ρ  σ      subscript   i        subscript  p  i    subscript  q  i        F(\rho,\sigma)=\sum_{i}\sqrt{p_{i}q_{i}}.     This shows that, heuristically, fidelity of quantum states is a genuine extension of the notion from probability theory.  Some properties  Unitary invariance  Direct calculation shows that the fidelity is preserved by unitary evolution, i.e.        F    (  ρ  ,  σ  )    =   F   (   U   ρ    U  *    ,   U  σ   U  *    )          F   ρ  σ      F     U  ρ   superscript  U       U  σ   superscript  U         \;F(\rho,\sigma)=F(U\rho\;U^{*},U\sigma U^{*})     for any unitary operator U .  Uhlmann's theorem  We saw that for two pure states, their fidelity coincides with the overlap. Uhlmann's theorem generalizes this statement to mixed states, in terms of their purifications:  Theorem Let ρ and σ be density matrices acting on C n . Let ρ ½ be the unique positive square root of ρ and       |   ψ  ρ   ⟩   =    ∑   i  =  1   n     (    ρ   1  2     |   e  i   ⟩    )   ⊗   |   e  i   ⟩     ∈    ℂ  n   ⊗   ℂ  n           ket   subscript  ψ  ρ      superscript   subscript     i  1    n    tensor-product     superscript  ρ    1  2     ket   subscript  e  i      ket   subscript  e  i            tensor-product   superscript  ℂ  n    superscript  ℂ  n       |\psi_{\rho}\rangle=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\rho^{\frac{1}{2}}|e_{i}\rangle)\otimes|e_{%
 i}\rangle\in\mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{n}     be a purification of ρ (therefore    {   |   e  i   ⟩   }      ket   subscript  e  i      \textstyle\{|e_{i}\rangle\}   is an orthonormal basis), then the following equality holds:       F   (  ρ  ,  σ  )    =    max   |   ψ  σ   ⟩     |   ⟨   ψ  ρ   |   ψ  σ   ⟩   |          F   ρ  σ      subscript    ket   subscript  ψ  σ        inner-product   subscript  ψ  ρ    subscript  ψ  σ        F(\rho,\sigma)=\max_{|\psi_{\sigma}\rangle}|\langle\psi_{\rho}|\psi_{\sigma}\rangle|     where    |   ψ  σ   ⟩     ket   subscript  ψ  σ     |\psi_{\sigma}\rangle   is a purification of σ. Therefore, in general, the fidelity is the maximum overlap between purifications.  Proof: A simple proof can be sketched as follows. Let    |  Ω  ⟩     ket  normal-Ω    \textstyle|\Omega\rangle   denote the vector       |  Ω  ⟩   =    ∑   i  =  1   n     |   e  i   ⟩   ⊗   |   e  i   ⟩          ket  normal-Ω     superscript   subscript     i  1    n    tensor-product   ket   subscript  e  i     ket   subscript  e  i        |\Omega\rangle=\sum_{i=1}^{n}|e_{i}\rangle\otimes|e_{i}\rangle     and σ ½ be the unique positive square root of σ. We see that, due to the unitary freedom in square root factorizations and choosing orthonormal bases, an arbitrary purification of σ is of the form       |   ψ  σ   ⟩   =    (     σ   1  2     V  1    ⊗   V  2    )    |  Ω  ⟩         ket   subscript  ψ  σ       tensor-product     superscript  σ    1  2     subscript  V  1     subscript  V  2     ket  normal-Ω      |\psi_{\sigma}\rangle=(\sigma^{\frac{1}{2}}V_{1}\otimes V_{2})|\Omega\rangle     where V i 's are unitary operators. Now we directly calculate        |   ⟨   ψ  ρ   |   ψ  σ   ⟩   |   =   |   ⟨  Ω  |    (    ρ   1  2    ⊗  I   )    (     σ   1  2     V  1    ⊗   V  2    )    |  Ω  ⟩   |   =   |   Tr   (    ρ   1  2     σ   1  2     V  1    V  2  T    )    |    .           inner-product   subscript  ψ  ρ    subscript  ψ  σ        quantum-operator-product  normal-Ω     tensor-product   superscript  ρ    1  2    I    tensor-product     superscript  σ    1  2     subscript  V  1     subscript  V  2     normal-Ω            Tr     superscript  ρ    1  2     superscript  σ    1  2     subscript  V  1    superscript   subscript  V  2   T         |\langle\psi_{\rho}|\psi_{\sigma}\rangle|=|\langle\Omega|(\rho^{\frac{1}{2}}%
 \otimes I)(\sigma^{\frac{1}{2}}V_{1}\otimes V_{2})|\Omega\rangle|=|%
 \operatorname{Tr}(\rho^{\frac{1}{2}}\sigma^{\frac{1}{2}}V_{1}V_{2}^{T})|.     But in general, for any square matrix A and unitary U , it is true that |Tr( AU )| ≤ Tr (( A * A ) ½ ). Furthermore, equality is achieved if U * is the unitary operator in the polar decomposition of A . From this follows directly Uhlmann's theorem.  Consequences  Some immediate consequences of Uhlmann's theorem are   Fidelity is symmetric in its arguments, i.e. F (ρ,σ) = F (σ,ρ). Notice this is not obvious from the definition.  F (ρ,σ) lies in [0,1], by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality .  F (ρ,σ) = 1 if and only if ρ = σ, since Ψ ρ = Ψ σ implies ρ = σ.   So we can see that fidelity behaves almost like a metric. This can be formalised and made useful by defining       cos   θ   ρ  σ     =   F   (  ρ  ,  σ  )           subscript  θ    ρ  σ       F   ρ  σ      \cos\theta_{\rho\sigma}=F(\rho,\sigma)\,   As the angle between the states   ρ   ρ   \rho   and   σ   σ   \sigma   . It follows from the above properties that    θ   ρ  σ      subscript  θ    ρ  σ     \theta_{\rho\sigma}   is non-negative, symmetric in its inputs, and is equal to zero if and only if    ρ  =  σ      ρ  σ    \rho=\sigma   . Furthermore, it can be proved that it obeys the triangle inequality, 2 so this angle is a metric on the state space: the Fubini–Study metric . 3  Relationship to trace distance  We can define the trace distance between two matrices A and B in terms of the trace norm by        D   (  A  ,  B  )    =    1  2      ∥   A  -  B   ∥   tr      .        D   A  B        1  2    subscript   norm    A  B    tr      D(A,B)=\frac{1}{2}\|A-B\|_{\rm tr}\,.     When A and B are both density operators, this is a quantum generalization of the statistical distance . This is relevant because the trace distance provides upper and lower bounds on the fidelity as quantified by the Fuchs–van de Graaf inequalities , 4        1  -   F   (  ρ  ,  σ  )     ≤   D   (  ρ  ,  σ  )    ≤     1  -   F    (  ρ  ,  σ  )   2        .          1    F   ρ  σ       D   ρ  σ             1    F   superscript   ρ  σ   2         1-F(\rho,\sigma)\leq D(\rho,\sigma)\leq\sqrt{1-F(\rho,\sigma)^{2}}\,.     Often the trace distance is easier to calculate or bound than the fidelity, so these relationships are quite useful. In the case that at least one of the states is a pure state Ψ, the lower bound can be tightened.        1  -   F    (  ψ  ,  ρ  )   2     ≤   D   (  ψ  ,  ρ  )     .        1    F   superscript   ψ  ρ   2       D   ψ  ρ      1-F(\psi,\rho)^{2}\leq D(\psi,\rho)\,.
