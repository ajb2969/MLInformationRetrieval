Existential instantiation

In predicate logic, existential instantiation (also called existential elimination)123 is a valid rule of inference which says that, given a formula of the form 
 
 
 
 , one may infer 
 
 
 
  for a new constant or variable symbol c. The rule has the restriction that the constant or variable c introduced by the rule must be a new term that has not occurred earlier in the proof.
In one formal notation, the rule may be denoted


 
  where a is an arbitrary term that has not been a part of our proof thus far.
