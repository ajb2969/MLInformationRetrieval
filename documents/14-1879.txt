   Existential instantiation      Existential instantiation   In predicate logic , existential instantiation (also called existential elimination ) 1 2 3 is a valid  rule of inference which says that, given a formula of the form     (   ∃  x   )   ϕ   (  x  )         x   ϕ  x    (\exists x)\phi(x)   , one may infer    ϕ   (  c  )       ϕ  c    \phi(c)   for a new constant or variable symbol c . The rule has the restriction that the constant or variable c introduced by the rule must be a new term that has not occurred earlier in the proof.  In one formal notation, the rule may be denoted       (  ∃  x  )   ℱ  x  :  :  ℱ  a  ,     fragments   fragments  normal-(   x  normal-)   F  x  normal-:  normal-:  F  a  normal-,    (\exists x)\mathcal{F}x::\mathcal{F}a,   where a is an arbitrary term that has not been a part of our proof thus far.
