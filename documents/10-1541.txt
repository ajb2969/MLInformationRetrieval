   Peptide-methionine (R)-S-oxide reductase      Peptide-methionine (R)-S-oxide reductase   In enzymology , a peptide-methionine (R)-S-oxide reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   peptide-L-methionine + thioredoxin disulfide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   peptide-L-methionine (R)-S-oxide + thioredoxin   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are peptide-L-methionine , thioredoxin disulfide , and H 2 O , whereas its two products are peptide-L-methionine (R)-S-oxide and thioredoxin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with a disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is peptide-methionine:thioredoxin-disulfide S-oxidoreductase [methionine (R)-S-oxide-forming] . Other names in common use include MsrB , methionine sulfoxide reductase (ambiguous) , pMSR , methionine S-oxide reductase (ambiguous) , selenoprotein R , methionine S-oxide reductase (R-form oxidizing) , methionine sulfoxide reductase B , SelR , SelX , PilB , and pRMsr .
