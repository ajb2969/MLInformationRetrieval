List of Indiana Pacers seasons

 The Indiana Pacers are a professional basketball team based in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. They are members of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Pacers were founded in 1967, originally as members of the American Basketball Association, where they were crowned league champions three times and made the playoffs in all of the nine seasons they participated in the league.1 The Pacers were led during the ABA days by two-time MVP Mel Daniels and by head coach Bobby Leonard.
The 1976–77 season marked the first season of NBA play for the Pacers and the team struggled early, compared to their ABA success. The Pacers only made it to the NBA playoffs three times in their first 13 seasons.2 The Pacers would not win their first playoff series until the 1993–94 season, which came against the Orlando Magic. It was during this time that the Pacers were led by 1987 draft pick, Reggie Miller, who will enter the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2012.3 Miller would play for the Pacers until the 2005 season and with his help, the Pacers would go onto win one Eastern Conference championship, four Central Division championships, and make fifteen playoff appearances.4
Over the Pacers forty-five seasons of play they have made the playoffs thirty-one times (twenty-two in the NBA and nine in the ABA). The Pacers have appeared in the NBA Eastern Conference Finals seven times and advanced to the NBA Finals in 2000, where they would lose to the Los Angeles Lakers 4–2.5 The Pacers are one of thirteen franchises to have never won an NBA championship.
