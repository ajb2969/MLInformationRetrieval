   (R)-2-haloacid dehalogenase      (R)-2-haloacid dehalogenase   In enzymology , a (R)-2-haloacid dehalogenase ()'', DL-2-haloacid halidohydrolase (inversion of configuration) , DL-DEXi , (R,S)-2-haloacid dehalogenase (configuration-inverting) ) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-2-haloacid + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (S)-2-hydroxyacid + halide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-2-haloacid and H 2 O , whereas its two products are (S)-2-hydroxyacid and halide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on halide bonds in carbon-halide compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-2-haloacid halidohydrolase . Other names in common use include 2-haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase[ambiguous] , 2-haloalkanoid acid halidohydrolase[ambiguous] , D-2-haloacid dehalogenase , and D-DEX .
