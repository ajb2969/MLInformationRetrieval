   Fluorothreonine transaldolase      Fluorothreonine transaldolase   In enzymology , a fluorothreonine transaldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L -threonine + fluoroacetaldehyde   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetaldehyde + 4-fluoro- L -threonine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L -threonine and fluoroacetaldehyde , whereas its two products are acetaldehyde and 4-fluoro- L -threonine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring aldehyde or ketonic groups (transaldolases and transketolases, respectively). The systematic name of this enzyme class is fluoroacetaldehyde:L-threonine aldehydetransferase .  References      "  Category:EC 2.2.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
