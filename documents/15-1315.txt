   TRNA (adenine57-N1/adenine58-N1)-methyltransferase      TRNA (adenine57-N1/adenine58-N1)-methyltransferase   TRNA (adenine 57 -N 1 /adenine 58 -N 1 )-methyltransferase (, TrmI , PabTrmI , AqTrmI , MtTrmI ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (adenine 57 /adenine 58 -N 1 )-methyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine 57 /adenine 58 in tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 1 -methyladenine 57 /N 1 -methyladenine 58 in tRNA   The enzyme catalyses the formation of N 1 -methyladenine at two adjacent positions (57 and 58) in the T-loop of certain tRNAs .
