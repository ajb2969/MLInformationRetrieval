TRNA (adenine57-N1/adenine58-N1)-methyltransferase

TRNA (adenine57-N1/adenine58-N1)-methyltransferase (, TrmI, PabTrmI, AqTrmI, MtTrmI) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (adenine57/adenine58-N1)-methyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine57/adenine58 in tRNA 
 
 
 
  2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N1-methyladenine57/N1-methyladenine58 in tRNA
 

The enzyme catalyses the formation of N1-methyladenine at two adjacent positions (57 and 58) in the T-loop of certain tRNAs .
