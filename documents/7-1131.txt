   Homeotopy      Homeotopy   In algebraic topology , an area of mathematics , a homeotopy group of a topological space is a homotopy group of the group of self-homeomorphisms of that space.  Definition  The homotopy group  functors     π  k     subscript  π  k    \pi_{k}   assign to each path-connected topological space   X   X   X   the group     π  k    (  X  )        subscript  π  k   X    \pi_{k}(X)   of homotopy classes of continuous maps      S  k   →  X   .     normal-→   superscript  S  k   X    S^{k}\to X.     Another construction on a space   X   X   X   is the group of all self-homeomorphisms     X  →  X     normal-→  X  X    X\to X   , denoted     Homeo   (  X  )    .      Homeo  X    {\rm Homeo}(X).   If X is a locally compact , locally connected  Hausdorff space then a fundamental result of R. Arens says that    Homeo   (  X  )       Homeo  X    {\rm Homeo}(X)   will in fact be a topological group under the compact-open topology .  Under the above assumptions, the homeotopy groups for   X   X   X   are defined to be:        H  M   E  k    (  X  )    =    π  k    (   Homeo   (  X  )    )     .        H  M   subscript  E  k   X      subscript  π  k     Homeo  X      HME_{k}(X)=\pi_{k}({\rm Homeo}(X)).     Thus     H  M   E  0    (  X  )    =    π  0    (   Homeo   (  X  )    )    =   M  C   G  *    (  X  )            H  M   subscript  E  0   X      subscript  π  0     Homeo  X           M  C   superscript  G    X      HME_{0}(X)=\pi_{0}({\rm Homeo}(X))=MCG^{*}(X)   is the extended  mapping class group for    X  .    X   X.   In other words, the extended mapping class group is the set of connected components of    Homeo   (  X  )       Homeo  X    {\rm Homeo}(X)   as specified by the functor     π  0   .     subscript  π  0    \pi_{0}.     Example  According to the Dehn-Nielsen theorem , if   X   X   X   is a closed surface then      H  M   E  0    (  X  )    =   Out   (    π  1    (  X  )    )     ,        H  M   subscript  E  0   X     Out     subscript  π  1   X      HME_{0}(X)={\rm Out}(\pi_{1}(X)),   the outer automorphism group of its fundamental group .
