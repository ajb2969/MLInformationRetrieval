Homeotopy

In algebraic topology, an area of mathematics, a homeotopy group of a topological space is a homotopy group of the group of self-homeomorphisms of that space.
Definition
The homotopy group functors

 
  assign to each path-connected topological space 
 
 
 
  the group 
 
 
 
  of homotopy classes of continuous maps 
 
 

Another construction on a space 
 
 
 
  is the group of all self-homeomorphisms

 
 , denoted 
 
 
 
  If X is a locally compact, locally connected Hausdorff space then a fundamental result of R. Arens says that 
 
 
 
  will in fact be a topological group under the compact-open topology.
Under the above assumptions, the homeotopy groups for 
 
 
 
  are defined to be:



Thus 
 
 
 
  is the extended mapping class group for 
 
 
 
  In other words, the extended mapping class group is the set of connected components of 
 
 
 
  as specified by the functor 
 
 

Example
According to the Dehn-Nielsen theorem, if 
 
 
 
  is a closed surface then 
 
 
 
  the outer automorphism group of its fundamental group.
