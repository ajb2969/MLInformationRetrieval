Symplectic category




Symplectic category

In mathematics, Weinstein's symplectic category is (roughly) a category whose objects are symplectic manifolds and whose morphisms are canonical relations, inclusions of Lagrangian submanifolds L into 
 
 
 
  where the superscript minus means minus the given symplectic form (for example, the graph of a symplectomorphism; hence, minus). The notion was introduced by A. Weinstein, according to whom "Quantization problems1 suggest that the category of symplectic manifolds and symplectomorphisms be augmented by the inclusion of canonical relations as morphisms." The composition of canonical relations is given by a fiber product.
Strictly speaking, the symplectic category is not a well-defined category (since the composition may not be well-defined) without some transversality conditions.
