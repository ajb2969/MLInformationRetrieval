Lipoyl amidotransferase

Lipoyl amidotransferase (, LipL (gene)) is an enzyme with system name (glycine cleavage system H)-N6-lipoyl-L-lysine:(lipoyl-carrier protein)-N6-L-lysine lipoyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

[glycine cleavage system H]-N6-lipoyl-L-lysine + [lipoyl-carrier protein] 
 
 
 
  glycine cleavage system H + [lipoyl-carrier protein]-N6-lipoyl-L-lysine
 

In the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes the enzyme takes part in a pathway for scavenging of lipoic acid.
