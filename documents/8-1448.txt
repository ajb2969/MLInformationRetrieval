   Barrow's inequality      Barrow's inequality   (Figure)  Barrow inequality.svg   In geometry , Barrow's inequality is an inequality relating the distances between an arbitrary point within a triangle , the vertices of the triangle, and certain points on the sides of the triangle.  Statement  Let P be an arbitrary point inside the triangle  ABC . From P and ABC , define U , V , and W as the points where the angle bisectors of BPC , CPA , and APB intersect the sides BC , CA , AB , respectively. Then Barrow's inequality states that         P  A   +   P  B   +   P  C    ≥   2   (    P  U   +   P  V   +   P  W    )     ,          P  A     P  B     P  C      2      P  U     P  V     P  W       PA+PB+PC\geq 2(PU+PV+PW),\,     with equality holding only in the case of an equilateral triangle .  History  Barrow's inequality strengthens the Erdős–Mordell inequality , which has identical form except with PU , PV , and PW replaced by the three distances of P from the triangle's sides. It is named after David Francis Barrow . Barrow's proof of this inequality was published in 1937, as his solution to a problem posed in the American Mathematical Monthly of proving the Erdős–Mordell inequality. 1  A simpler proof was later given by Mordell. 2  See also   Euler's theorem in geometry  List of triangle inequalities   References  External links   Hojoo Lee: Topics in Inequalities - Theorems and Techniques   "  Category:Triangle geometry  Category:Geometric inequalities     . ↩  . ↩
