   Albert Ingham      Albert Ingham   Albert Edward Ingham  FRS (3 April 1900 – 6 September 1967) was an English  mathematician . 1  Education  Ingham was born in Northampton . He went to Stafford Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge . 2  Research  Ingham supervised the Ph.D.s of C. Brian Haselgrove , Wolfgang Fuchs and Christopher Hooley . 3 Ingham died in Chamonix , France .  Ingham proved in 1937 4 that if       ζ   (    1  /  2   +   i  t    )    =   O   (   t  c   )          ζ      1  2     i  t       O   superscript  t  c      \zeta\left(1/2+it\right)=O\left(t^{c}\right)     for some positive constant c , then         π   (   x  +   x  θ    )    -   π   (  x  )     ∼    x  θ    log  x     ,     similar-to      π    x   superscript  x  θ       π  x       superscript  x  θ     x      \pi\left(x+x^{\theta}\right)-\pi(x)\sim\frac{x^{\theta}}{\log x},     for any θ > (1+4c)/(2+4c). Here ζ denotes the Riemann zeta function and π the prime-counting function .  Using the best published value for c at the time, an immediate consequence of his result was that   g n  n 5/8 ,   where p n the n -th prime number and g n = p n +1 − p n denotes the n -th prime gap .
