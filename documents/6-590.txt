   Different ideal      Different ideal   In algebraic number theory , the different ideal (sometimes simply the different ) is defined to measure the (possible) lack of duality in the ring of integers of an algebraic number field  K , with respect to the field trace . It then encodes the ramification data for prime ideals of the ring of integers. It was introduced by Richard Dedekind in 1882. 1 2  Definition  If O K is the ring of integers of K , and tr denotes the field trace from K to the rational number field  Q , then      x  ↦   tr   x  2       maps-to  x   tr   superscript  x  2      x\mapsto\operatorname{tr}~{}x^{2}     is an integral quadratic form on O K . Its discriminant as quadratic form need not be +1 (in fact this happens only for the case K = Q ). Define the inverse different or codifferent 3 4 or Dedekind's complementary module 5 as the set I of x ∈ K such that tr( xy ) is an integer for all y in O K , then I is a fractional ideal of K containing O K . By definition, the different ideal δ K is the inverse fractional ideal I −1 : it is an ideal of O K .  The ideal norm of δ K is equal to the ideal of Z generated by the field discriminant  D K of K .  The different of an element α of K with minimal polynomial f is defined to be δ(α) = f ′(α) if α generates the field K (and zero otherwise): 6 we may write       δ   (  α  )    =   ∏   (   α  -   α   (  i  )     )          δ  α    product    α   superscript  α  i       \delta(\alpha)=\prod\left({\alpha-\alpha^{(i)}}\right)     where the α ( i ) run over all the roots of the characteristic polynomial of α other than α itself. 7 The different ideal is generated by the differents of all integers α in O K . 8 9 This is Dedekind's original definition. 10  The different is also defined for an finite degree extension of local fields . It plays a basic role in Pontryagin duality for p-adic fields .  Relative different  The relative different δ L / K is defined in a similar manner for an extension of number fields L / K . The relative norm of the relative different is then equal to the relative discriminant Δ L / K . 11 In a tower of fields  L / K / F the relative differents are related by δ L / F = δ L / K δ K / F . 12 13  The relative different equals the annihilator of the relative Kähler differential module    Ω    O  L   /   O  K    1     subscript   superscript  normal-Ω  1      subscript  O  L    subscript  O  K      \Omega^{1}_{O_{L}/O_{K}}   : 14 15       δ   L  /  K    =   {   x  ∈   O  L    :    x  d  y   =   0  for all  y   ∈   O  L    }    .       subscript  δ    L  K     conditional-set    x   subscript  O  L          x  normal-d  y     0  for all  y         subscript  O  L        \delta_{L/K}=\{x\in O_{L}:x\mathrm{d}y=0\text{ for all }y\in O_{L}\}.     The ideal class of the relative different δ L / K is always a square in the class group of O L , the ring of integers of L . 16 Since the relative discriminant is the norm of the relative different it is the square of a class in the class group of O K : 17 indeed, it is the square of the Steinitz class for O L as a O K -module. 18  Ramification  The relative different encodes the ramification data of the field extension L / K . A prime ideal p of K ramifies in L if the factorisation of p in L contains a prime of L to a power higher than 1: this occurs if and only if p divides the relative discriminant Δ L / K . More precisely, if   p = P 1 e (1) ... P k e ( k )    is the factorisation of p into prime ideals of L then P i divides the relative different δ L / K if and only if P i is ramified, that is, if and only if the ramification index e ( i ) is greater than 1. 19 20 The precise exponent to which a ramified prime P divides δ is termed the differential exponent of P and is equal to e − 1 if P is tamely ramified : that is, when P does not divide e . 21 In the case when P is wildly ramified the differential exponent lies in the range e to e + ν P (e) − 1. 22 23 24 The differential exponent can be computed from the orders of the higher ramification groups for Galois extensions: 25          ∑   i  =  0   ∞    (    |   G  i   |   -  1   )    .      superscript   subscript     i  0           subscript  G  i    1     \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}(|G_{i}|-1).        Local computation  The different may be defined for an extension of local fields L / K . In this case we may take the extension to be simple , generated by a primitive element α which also generates a power integral basis . If f is the minimal polynomial for α then the different is generated by f '(α).  Notes  References     .
