   Glycoprotein 6-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase      Glycoprotein 6-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a glycoprotein 6-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GDP-L-fucose + N 4 -{N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->3)-[N- acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->6)]-beta-D- mannosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D- glucosaminyl}asparagine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GDP + N 4 -{N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->3)-[N- acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->6)]-beta-D- mannosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-[alpha-L- fucosyl-(1->6)]-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl}asparagine   The 5 substrates of this enzyme are GDP-L-fucose , N4-{N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->3)-[N- , [[acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->6)]-beta-D-]], mannosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D- , and glucosaminyl}asparagine , whereas its 5 products are GDP , N4-{N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->3)-[N- , [[acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->6)]-beta-D-]], mannosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-[alpha-L- , and [[fucosyl-(1->6)]-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl}asparagine]].  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GDP-L-fucose:glycoprotein (L-fucose to asparagine-linked N-acetylglucosamine of N4-{N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->3)-[N-a cetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->6)]-beta-D-man nosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glu cosaminyl}asparagine) 6-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase .
