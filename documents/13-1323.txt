To learn how to see this markup, and to save an edit, see: Help:Editing . There is a short list of markup and tips at Help:Cheatsheet .  In addition to wiki markup, some HTML elements are also allowed for presentation formatting. See Help:HTML in wikitext for information on this.  Layout  Sections  Sections in a page will follow the page's lead/introduction and (under certain conditions,) the Table of Contents .  Section headings  The = through ====== markup are headings for the sections with which they are associated.   A single = is styled as the article title and should not be used within an article.  Headings are styled through CSS and add an [edit] link.  Four or more headings cause a table of contents to be generated automatically.  Do not use any markup after the final heading markup – this will either break the heading, or will cause the heading to not be included in an edit summary.   And so on.  Wiki headings translate to HTML  heading elements ,  through , styled as follows by default:  {{#lst:Help:HTML in wikitext|HTML_section}}  Templates:  for use in documentation.  Horizontal rule  The horizontal rule represents a paragraph-level thematic break. Do not use in article content, as rules are only used after main sections, and this is automatic.  HTML equivalent:  Table of contents  When a page has at least four headings, a table of contents (TOC) will automatically appear after the lead and before the first heading. The TOC can be controlled by magic words or templates:   __FORCETOC__ forces the TOC to appear at the normal location regardless of the number of headings.  __TOC__ forces the TOC to appear at the point where the magic word is inserted instead of the normal location.  __NOTOC__ disables the TOC entirely.   can be used to control the depth of subsections included in the TOC. This is useful where the TOC is long and unwieldy.  :Category:Wikipedia table of contents templates contains a number of specialized TOC templates.   Line breaks  Line breaks or newlines are used to add whitespace between lines, such as separating paragraphs.   A line break that is visible in the content is inserted by pressing  twice.  Pressing  once will place a line break in the markup, but it will not show in the rendered content, except when using list markup.  Markup such as bold or italics will be terminated at a line break.   HTML equivalent:  or  Templates:    adds multiple line breaks.   and  adds a break with styling, to clear floating elements.   and  both create an unbulleted list.   Indent text  Indentation is most commonly used on talk pages.  Templates: ,  Blockquote  When there is a need for separating a block of text. This is useful for (as the name says) inserting blocks of quoted (and cited) text.  Center text  Template  uses the same markup. To center a table, see Help:Table#Centering tables . Please do not use , as it is obsolete.  Align text to right  You can align content in a separate container:  Or; make the text float around it:  Lists  Do not leave blank lines between items in a list unless there is a reason to do so, since this causes the MediaWiki software to interpret each item as beginning a new list.  Unordered lists  Ordered lists  Description lists  To list terms and definitions, start a new line with a semicolon (;) followed by the term. Then, type a colon (:) followed by a definition. The format can also be used for other purposes, such as make and models of vehicles, etc.  Description lists (formerly definition lists , and a.k.a. association lists ) consist of group names corresponding to values. Group names (terms) are in bold. Values (definitions) are indented. Each group must include one or more definitions. For a single or first value, the : can be placed on the same line after ; – but subsequent values must be placed on separate lines.  HTML equivalent:  ,  Templates:  Retaining newlines and spaces  The MediaWiki software suppresses single newlines and converts lines starting with a space to preformatted text in a dashed box. HTML suppresses multiple spaces. It is often desirable to retain these elements for poems, lyrics, mottoes, oaths and the like. The Poem extension adds HTML-like  tags to maintain newlines and spaces. These tags may be used inside other tags such as . CSS styles may be applied to this tag, e.g.: .  Format  Text formatting      Description   What you type   What it looks like       italics , bold ,  To ''italicize text'', put two

 Five consecutive apostrophes on each

 For text as {{smallcaps|small caps}}, 
 use the template {{tl|smallcaps}}.   To italicize text , put two consecutive apostrophes on each side of it. Three apostrophes each side will bold the text . Five consecutive apostrophes on each side (two for italics plus three for bold) produces bold italics . Italic and bold formatting only works correctly within a single line.

Syntax highlighting for source code. Computer code has colored text and more stringent formatting. For example, to define a function: int m2() , with highlights.  #include int m2 (int ax, char *p_ax) {

   return 0;

 the "small" tag can also be used to style= "font-size:87%;" > reduce 
 a text's font-size to 87% .  To match, for example, the font-size used in an image caption , the "small" tag can also be used to reduce a text's font-size to 87% .    Big text  Better not use big text ,

To prevent two words from becoming separated by a linewrap (e.g. Mr. Smith or 400 km/h ) a non-breaking space , sometimes also called a "non-printing character", may be used between them. (For three or more words, the template  is probably more suitable.)  Mr. Smith or 400 km/h   Mr. Smith or 400 km/h     Extra spacing within text is usually best achieved using the  template.
