   Lie bialgebroid      Lie bialgebroid   A Lie bialgebroid is a mathematical structure in the area of non-Riemannian differential geometry. In brief a Lie bialgebroid are two compatible Lie algebroids defined on dual vector bundles. They form the vector bundle version of a Lie bialgebra .  Definition  Preliminary notions  Remember that a Lie algebroid is defined as a skew-symmetric operation [.,.] on the sections Γ( A ) of a vector bundle  A→M over a smooth manifold M together with a vector bundle morphism ρ: A→TM subject to the Leibniz rule        [  ϕ  ,   f  ⋅  ψ   ]   =     ρ   (  ϕ  )    [  f  ]    ⋅  ψ   +   f  ⋅   [  ϕ  ,  ψ  ]      ,       ϕ   normal-⋅  f  ψ       normal-⋅    ρ  ϕ   delimited-[]  f    ψ    normal-⋅  f   ϕ  ψ       [\phi,f\cdot\psi]=\rho(\phi)[f]\cdot\psi+f\cdot[\phi,\psi],     and Jacobi identity       [  ϕ  ,   [   ψ  1   ,   ψ  2   ]   ]   =    [   [  ϕ  ,   ψ  1   ]   ,   ψ  2   ]   +   [   ψ  1   ,   [  ϕ  ,   ψ  2   ]   ]         ϕ    subscript  ψ  1    subscript  ψ  2         ϕ   subscript  ψ  1     subscript  ψ  2      subscript  ψ  1    ϕ   subscript  ψ  2        [\phi,[\psi_{1},\psi_{2}]]=[[\phi,\psi_{1}],\psi_{2}]+[\psi_{1},[\phi,\psi_{2}]]   where Φ , ψ k are sections of A and f is a smooth function on M .  The Lie bracket [.,.] A can be extended to multivector fields Γ(⋀ A ) graded symmetric via the Leibniz rule        [   Φ  ∧  Ψ   ,   \Chi   ]   A   =     Φ  ∧    [  Ψ  ,   \Chi   ]   A    +     (   -  1   )     |  Ψ  |    (    |   \Chi   |   -  1   )       [  Φ  ,   \Chi   ]   A     ∧  Ψ        subscript     normal-Φ  normal-Ψ   \Chi   A         normal-Φ   subscript   normal-Ψ  \Chi   A       superscript    1       normal-Ψ       \Chi   1      subscript   normal-Φ  \Chi   A     normal-Ψ     [\Phi\wedge\Psi,\Chi]_{A}=\Phi\wedge[\Psi,\Chi]_{A}+(-1)^{|\Psi|(|\Chi|-1)}[%

The Lie algebroid differential is an R -linear operator d A on the A -forms Ω A ( M ) = Γ(⋀ A * ) of degree 1 subject to the Leibniz-rule        d  A    (   α  ∧  β   )    =      (    d  A   α   )   ∧  β   +     (   -  1   )    |  α  |    α    ∧    d  A   β           subscript  d  A     α  β             subscript  d  A   α   β      superscript    1     α    α       subscript  d  A   β      d_{A}(\alpha\wedge\beta)=(d_{A}\alpha)\wedge\beta+(-1)^{|\alpha|}\alpha\wedge d%

The definition  A Lie bialgebroid are two Lie algebroids ( A ,ρ A ,[.,.] A ) and ( A * ,ρ * ,[.,.] * ) on dual vector bundles A→M and A * → M subject to the compatibility        d  *     [  ϕ  ,  ψ  ]   A    =     [    d  *   ϕ   ,  ψ  ]   A   +    [  ϕ  ,    d  *   ψ   ]   A           subscript  d     subscript   ϕ  ψ   A       subscript      subscript  d    ϕ   ψ   A    subscript   ϕ     subscript  d    ψ    A      d_{*}[\phi,\psi]_{A}=[d_{*}\phi,\psi]_{A}+[\phi,d_{*}\psi]_{A}   for all sections Φ , ψ of A . Here d * denotes the Lie algebroid differential of A * which also operates on the multivector fields Γ(∧ A ).  Symmetry of the definition  It can be shown that the definition is symmetric in A and A * , i.e. ( A , A * ) is a Lie bialgebroid iff ( A * , A ) is.  Examples  1. A Lie bialgebra are two Lie algebras ( g ,[.,.] g ) and ( g * ,[.,.] * ) on dual vector spaces g and g * such that the Chevalley–Eilenberg differential δ * is a derivation of the g -bracket.  2. A Poisson manifold ( M ,π) gives naturally rise to a Lie bialgebroid on TM (with the commutator bracket of tangent vector fields) and T * M with the Lie bracket induced by the Poisson structure. The T * M -differential is d * = [π, .] and the compatibility follows then from the Jacobi-identity of the Schouten bracket.  Infinitesimal version of a Poisson groupoid  It is well known that the infinitesimal version of a Lie groupoid is a Lie algebroid. (As a special case the infinitesimal version of a Lie group is a Lie algebra.) Therefore one can ask which structures need to be differentiated in order to obtain a Lie bialgebroid.  Definition of Poisson groupoid  A Poisson groupoid is a Lie groupoid ( G ⇉ M ) together with a Poisson structure π on G such that the multiplication graph m ⊂ G × G ×( G ,−   π   π   \pi   ) is coisotropic . An example of a Poisson Lie groupoid is a Poisson Lie group (where M =pt, just a point). Another example is a symplectic groupoid (where the Poisson structure is non-degenerate on TG ).  Differentiation of the structure  Remember the construction of a Lie algebroid from a Lie groupoid. We take the t-tangent fibers (or equivalently the s-tangent fibers) and consider their vector bundle pulled back to the base manifold M . A section of this vector bundle can be identified with a G -invariant t-vector field on G which form a Lie algebra with respect to the commutator bracket on TG .  We thus take the Lie algebroid A→M of the Poisson groupoid. It can be shown that the Poisson structure induces a fiber-linear Poisson structure on A . Analogous to the construction of the cotangent Lie algebroid of a Poisson manifold there is a Lie algebroid structure on A * induced by this Poisson structure. Analogous to the Poisson manifold case one can show that A and A * form a Lie bialgebroid.  Double of a Lie bialgebroid and superlanguage of Lie bialgebroids  For Lie bialgebroids ( g , g * ) there is the notion of Manin triples, i.e. c= g + g * can be endowed with the structure of a Lie algebra such that g and g * are subalgebras and c contains the representation of g on g * , vice versa. The sum structure is just       [   X  +  α   ,   Y  +  β   ]   =        [  X  ,  Y  ]   g   +    ad  α   Y    -    ad  β   X    +    [  α  ,  β  ]   *   +    ad  X  *   β    -    ad  Y  *   α           X  α     Y  β             subscript   X  Y   g      subscript  ad  α   Y       subscript  ad  β   X     subscript   α  β        subscript   superscript  ad    X   β       subscript   superscript  ad    Y   α      [X+\alpha,Y+\beta]=[X,Y]_{g}+\mathrm{ad}_{\alpha}Y-\mathrm{ad}_{\beta}X+[%
 \alpha,\beta]_{*}+\mathrm{ad}^{*}_{X}\beta-\mathrm{ad}^{*}_{Y}\alpha   .  Courant algebroids  It turns out that the naive generalization to Lie algebroids does not give a Lie algebroid any more. Instead one has to modify either the Jacobi identity or violate the skew-symmetry and is thus lead to Courant algebroids . 1  Superlanguage  The appropriate superlanguage of a Lie algebroid A is ΠA , the supermanifold whose space of (super)functions are the A -forms. On this space the Lie algebroid can be encoded via its Lie algebroid differential, which is just an odd vector field.  As a first guess the super-realization of a Lie bialgebroid ( A , A * ) should be ΠA + ΠA * . But unfortunately d A +d * | ΠA + ΠA * is not a differential, basically because A + A * is not a Lie algebroid. Instead using the larger N-graded manifold  T * [2]A[1] = T * [2]A * [1] to which we can lift d A and d * as odd Hamiltonian vector fields, then their sum squares to 0 iff ( A , A * ) is a Lie bialgebroid.
