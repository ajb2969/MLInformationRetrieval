   Trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase      Trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase   In enzymology , a trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   NADH + H + + trimethylamine N-oxide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   NAD + + trimethylamine + H 2 O   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are NADH , H + , and trimethylamine N-oxide , whereas its 3 products are NAD + , trimethylamine , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on NADH or NADPH with a nitrogenous group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is NADH:trimethylamine-N-oxide oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include trimethylamine N-oxide reductase , trimethylamine oxide reductase , TMAO reductase , and TOR . This enzyme participates in methane metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
