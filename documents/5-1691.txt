   Riemann series theorem      Riemann series theorem   In mathematics , the Riemann series theorem (also called the Riemann rearrangement theorem ), named after 19th-century German mathematician Bernhard Riemann , says that if an infinite series is conditionally convergent , then its terms can be arranged in a permutation so that the new series converges to any given value, or diverges .  Definitions  A series     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}    converges if there exists a value   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   such that the sequence of the partial sums         {   S  1   ,   S  2   ,   S  3   ,  …  }   ,   S  n    =    ∑   k  =  1   n    a  k     ,         subscript  S  1    subscript  S  2    subscript  S  3   normal-…    subscript  S  n      superscript   subscript     k  1    n    subscript  a  k      \left\{S_{1},\ S_{2},\ S_{3},\dots\right\},\quad S_{n}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k},     converges to   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   . That is, for any ε > 0, there exists an integer N such that if n ≥ N , then        |    S  n   -  ℓ   |   ≤  ϵ   .           subscript  S  n   normal-ℓ    ϵ    \left|S_{n}-\ell\right|\leq\ \epsilon.     A series converges conditionally if the series     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}   converges but the series     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    |   a  n   |       superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  a  n      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|a_{n}\right|   diverges.  A permutation is simply a bijection from the set of positive integers to itself. This means that if   σ   σ   \sigma   is a permutation, then for any positive integer   b   b   b   , there exists exactly one positive integer   a   a   a   such that     σ   (  a  )    =  b        σ  a   b    \sigma(a)=b   . In particular, if    x  ≠  y      x  y    x\neq y   , then     σ   (  x  )    ≠   σ   (  y  )          σ  x     σ  y     \sigma(x)\neq\sigma(y)   .  Statement of the theorem  Suppose that      {   a  1   ,   a  2   ,   a  3   ,  …  }      subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2    subscript  a  3   normal-…    \left\{a_{1},\ a_{2},\ a_{3},\dots\right\}     is a sequence of real numbers , and that     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}   is conditionally convergent. Let   M   M   M   be a real number. Then there exists a permutation     σ   (  n  )       σ  n    \sigma(n)   of the sequence such that         ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a   σ   (  n  )      =  M   .        superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a    σ  n     M    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{\sigma(n)}=M.     There also exists a permutation    σ   (  n  )       σ  n    \sigma(n)   such that         ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a   σ   (  n  )      =  ∞   .        superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a    σ  n        \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{\sigma(n)}=\infty.     The sum can also be rearranged to diverge to    -  ∞         -\infty   or to fail to approach any limit, finite or infinite.  Examples  Changing the sum  The alternating harmonic series is a classic example of a conditionally convergent series:       ∑   n  =  1   ∞      (   -  1   )    n  +  1    n       superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript    1     n  1    n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}     is convergent, while       ∑   n  =  1   ∞    |     (   -  1   )    n  +  1    n   |       superscript   subscript     n  1           superscript    1     n  1    n      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\bigg|\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}\bigg|     is the ordinary harmonic series , which diverges. Although in standard presentation the alternating harmonic series converges to ln(2), its terms can be arranged to converge to any number, or even to diverge. One instance of this is as follows. Begin with the series written in the usual order,         1  -   1  2    +   1  3    -   1  4    +  ⋯            1    1  2      1  3      1  4    normal-⋯    1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}+\cdots     and rearrange the terms:           1  -   1  2   -   1  4    +   1  3    -   1  6   -   1  8    +   1  5    -   1  10   -   1  12    +  ⋯                1    1  2     1  4      1  3      1  6     1  8      1  5      1  10     1  12    normal-⋯    1-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{6}-\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{5}-%
 \frac{1}{10}-\frac{1}{12}+\cdots     where the pattern is: the first two terms are 1 and −1/2, whose sum is 1/2. The next term is −1/4. The next two terms are 1/3 and −1/6, whose sum is 1/6. The next term is −1/8. The next two terms are 1/5 and −1/10, whose sum is 1/10. In general, the sum is composed of blocks of three:           1    2  k   -  1    -   1   2   (    2  k   -  1   )     -   1   4  k     ,  k   =  1   ,   2  ,  …    .     formulae-sequence         1      2  k   1      1    2      2  k   1       1    4  k     k   1    2  normal-…     \frac{1}{2k-1}-\frac{1}{2(2k-1)}-\frac{1}{4k},\quad k=1,2,\dots.     This is indeed a rearrangement of the alternating harmonic series: every odd integer occurs once positively, and the even integers occur once each, negatively (half of them as multiples of 4, the other half as twice odd integers). Since         1    2  k   -  1    -   1   2   (    2  k   -  1   )      =   1   2   (    2  k   -  1   )      ,          1      2  k   1      1    2      2  k   1        1    2      2  k   1       \frac{1}{2k-1}-\frac{1}{2(2k-1)}=\frac{1}{2(2k-1)},     this series can in fact be written:            1  2   -   1  4    +   1  6    -   1  8    +   1  10   +  ⋯  +   1   2   (    2  k   -  1   )      -   1   2   (   2  k   )      +  ⋯                  1  2     1  4      1  6      1  8      1  10   normal-⋯    1    2      2  k   1        1    2    2  k      normal-⋯    \frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{6}-\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{10}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2%
 (2k-1)}-\frac{1}{2(2k)}+\cdots          =    1  2    (    1  -   1  2    +   1  3   +  ⋯   )    =    1  2    ln   (  2  )           absent      1  2       1    1  2      1  3   normal-⋯             1  2     2       =\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots\right)=\frac{1}{2}\ln(2)   which is half the usual sum.  Getting an arbitrary sum  An efficient way to recover and generalize the result of the previous section is to use the fact that        1  +   1  2   +   1  3   +  ⋯  +   1  n    =   γ  +   ln  n   +   o   (  1  )      ,        1    1  2     1  3   normal-⋯    1  n      γ    n     o  1      1+{1\over 2}+{1\over 3}+\cdots+{1\over n}=\gamma+\ln n+o(1),     where γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant , and where the notation o(1) denotes a quantity that depends upon the current variable (here, the variable is n ) in such a way that this quantity goes to 0 when the variable tends to infinity.  It follows that the sum of q even terms satisfies         1  2   +   1  4   +   1  6   +  ⋯  +   1   2  q     =      1  2    γ   +    1  2    ln  q    +   o   (  1  )      ,          1  2     1  4     1  6   normal-⋯    1    2  q           1  2   γ       1  2     q      o  1      {1\over 2}+{1\over 4}+{1\over 6}+\cdots+{1\over 2q}={1\over 2}\,\gamma+{1\over

 }\ln q+o(1),     and by taking the difference, one sees that the sum of p odd terms satisfies        1  +   1  3   +   1  5   +  ⋯  +   1    2  p   -  1     =      1  2    γ   +    1  2    ln  p    +   ln  2   +   o   (  1  )      .        1    1  3     1  5   normal-⋯    1      2  p   1           1  2   γ       1  2     p      2     o  1      {1}+{1\over 3}+{1\over 5}+\cdots+{1\over 2p-1}={1\over 2}\,\gamma+{1\over 2}%
 \ln p+\ln 2+o(1).     Suppose that two positive integers a and b are given, and that a rearrangement of the alternating harmonic series is formed by taking, in order, a positive terms from the alternating harmonic series, followed by b negative terms, and repeating this pattern at infinity (the alternating series itself corresponds to , the example in the preceding section corresponds to a = 1, b = 2):         1  +   1  3   +  ⋯  +   1    2  a   -  1     -   1  2   -   1  4   -  ⋯  -   1   2  b     +   1    2  a   +  1    +  ⋯  +   1    4  a   -  1     -   1    2  b   +  2    -  ⋯            1    1  3   normal-⋯    1      2  a   1       1  2     1  4   normal-⋯    1    2  b       1      2  a   1    normal-⋯    1      4  a   1       1      2  b   2    normal-⋯    {1}+{1\over 3}+\cdots+{1\over 2a-1}-{1\over 2}-{1\over 4}-\cdots-{1\over 2b}+{%
 1\over 2a+1}+\cdots+{1\over 4a-1}-{1\over 2b+2}-\cdots     Then the partial sum of order ( a + b ) n of this rearranged series contains  positive odd terms and  negative even terms, hence        S    (   a  +  b   )   n    =       1  2    ln  p    +   ln  2    -    1  2    ln  q     +   o   (  1  )     =     1  2    ln   (   a  /  b   )     +   ln  2   +   o   (  1  )      .         subscript  S      a  b   n              1  2     p      2        1  2     q       o  1               1  2       a  b       2     o  1       S_{(a+b)n}={1\over 2}\ln p+\ln 2-{1\over 2}\ln q+o(1)={1\over 2}\ln(a/b)+\ln 2%
 +o(1).     It follows that the sum of this rearranged series is          1  2    ln   (   a  /  b   )     +   ln  2    =   ln   (   2    a  /  b     )     .            1  2       a  b       2        2      a  b        {1\over 2}\ln(a/b)+\ln 2=\ln\bigl(2\sqrt{a/b}\bigr).     Suppose now that, more generally, a rearranged series of the alternating harmonic series is organized in such a way that the ratio between the number of positive and negative terms in the partial sum of order n tends to a positive limit r . Then, the sum of such a rearrangement will be       ln   (   2   r    )    ,        2    r      \ln\bigl(2\sqrt{r}\bigr),     and this explains that any real number x can be obtained as sum of a rearranged series of the alternating harmonic series: it suffices to form a rearrangement for which the limit r is equal .  Proof  For simplicity, this proof assumes first that a n ≠ 0 for every n . The general case requires a simple modification, given below. Recall that a conditionally convergent series of real terms has both infinitely many negative terms and infinitely many positive terms. First, define two quantities,    a  n  +     superscript   subscript  a  n      a_{n}^{+}   and    a  n  -     superscript   subscript  a  n      a_{n}^{-}   by:         a  n  +   =     a  n   +   |   a  n   |    2    ,    a  n  -   =     a  n   -   |   a  n   |    2     .     formulae-sequence     superscript   subscript  a  n          subscript  a  n      subscript  a  n     2       superscript   subscript  a  n          subscript  a  n      subscript  a  n     2      a_{n}^{+}=\frac{a_{n}+|a_{n}|}{2},\quad a_{n}^{-}=\frac{a_{n}-|a_{n}|}{2}.     That is, the series     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n  +       superscript   subscript     n  1       superscript   subscript  a  n       \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}^{+}   includes all a n positive, with all negative terms replaced by zeroes, and the series     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n  -       superscript   subscript     n  1       superscript   subscript  a  n       \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}^{-}   includes all a n negative, with all positive terms replaced by zeroes. Since     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}   is conditionally convergent, both the positive and the negative series diverge. Let M be a positive real number. Take, in order, just enough positive terms    a  n  +     superscript   subscript  a  n      a_{n}^{+}   so that their sum exceeds M . Suppose we require p terms – then the following statement is true:         ∑   n  =  1    p  -  1     a  n  +    ≤  M  <    ∑   n  =  1   p    a  n  +     .          superscript   subscript     n  1      p  1     superscript   subscript  a  n      M         superscript   subscript     n  1    p    superscript   subscript  a  n         \sum_{n=1}^{p-1}a_{n}^{+}\leq M<\sum_{n=1}^{p}a_{n}^{+}.     This is possible for any M > 0 because the partial sums of    a  n  +     superscript   subscript  a  n      a_{n}^{+}   tend to    +  ∞         +\infty   . Discarding the zero terms one may write          ∑   n  =  1   p    a  n  +    =    a   σ   (  1  )     +  ⋯  +   a   σ   (   m  1   )       ,     a   σ   (  j  )     >  0   ,    σ   (  1  )    <  …  <   σ   (   m  1   )    =  p     .     formulae-sequence      superscript   subscript     n  1    p    superscript   subscript  a  n         subscript  a    σ  1    normal-⋯   subscript  a    σ   subscript  m  1        formulae-sequence     subscript  a    σ  j    0         σ  1   normal-…         σ   subscript  m  1         p       \sum_{n=1}^{p}a_{n}^{+}=a_{\sigma(1)}+\cdots+a_{\sigma(m_{1})},\quad a_{\sigma%
 (j)}>0,\ \ \sigma(1)<\ldots<\sigma(m_{1})=p.     Now we add just enough negative terms    a  n  -     superscript   subscript  a  n      a_{n}^{-}   , say q of them, so that the resulting sum is less than M . This is always possible because the partial sums of    a  n  -     superscript   subscript  a  n      a_{n}^{-}   tend to    -  ∞         -\infty   . Now we have:          ∑   n  =  1   p    a  n  +    +    ∑   n  =  1   q    a  n  -     <  M  ≤     ∑   n  =  1   p    a  n  +    +    ∑   n  =  1    q  -  1     a  n  -      .            superscript   subscript     n  1    p    superscript   subscript  a  n        superscript   subscript     n  1    q    superscript   subscript  a  n       M           superscript   subscript     n  1    p    superscript   subscript  a  n        superscript   subscript     n  1      q  1     superscript   subscript  a  n          \sum_{n=1}^{p}a_{n}^{+}+\sum_{n=1}^{q}a_{n}^{-}     Again, one may write          ∑   n  =  1   p    a  n  +    +    ∑   n  =  1   q    a  n  -     =    a   σ   (  1  )     +  ⋯  +   a   σ   (   m  1   )     +   a   σ   (    m  1   +  1   )     +  ⋯  +   a   σ   (   n  1   )       ,          superscript   subscript     n  1    p    superscript   subscript  a  n        superscript   subscript     n  1    q    superscript   subscript  a  n          subscript  a    σ  1    normal-⋯   subscript  a    σ   subscript  m  1      subscript  a    σ     subscript  m  1   1     normal-⋯   subscript  a    σ   subscript  n  1        \sum_{n=1}^{p}a_{n}^{+}+\sum_{n=1}^{q}a_{n}^{-}=a_{\sigma(1)}+\cdots+a_{\sigma%
 (m_{1})}+a_{\sigma(m_{1}+1)}+\cdots+a_{\sigma(n_{1})},     with        σ   (    m  1   +  1   )    <  …  <   σ   (   n  1   )    =  q   .          σ     subscript  m  1   1    normal-…         σ   subscript  n  1         q     \sigma(m_{1}+1)<\ldots<\sigma(n_{1})=q.     Note that σ is injective, and that 1 belongs to the range of σ , either as image of 1 (if a 1 > 0), or as image of (if a 1 $=$|p'' + 1}}, and then adding just enough negative terms to be less than M , starting with . Extend σ in an injective manner, in order to cover all terms selected so far, and observe that must have been selected now or before, thus 2 belongs to the range of this extension. The process will have infinitely many such " changes of direction ". One eventually obtains a rearrangement . After the first change of direction, each partial sum of differs from M by at most the absolute value    a   p  j   +     superscript   subscript  a   subscript  p  j       a_{p_{j}}^{+}   or    |   a   q  j   -   |       superscript   subscript  a   subscript  q  j        |a_{q_{j}}^{-}|   of the term that appeared at the latest change of direction. But converges, so as n tends to infinity, each of a n ,    a   p  j   +     superscript   subscript  a   subscript  p  j       a_{p_{j}}^{+}   and    a   q  j   -     superscript   subscript  a   subscript  q  j       a_{q_{j}}^{-}   go to 0. Thus, the partial sums of tend to M , so the following is true:         ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a   σ   (  n  )      =  M   .        superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a    σ  n     M    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{\sigma(n)}=M.     The same method can be used to show convergence to M negative or zero.  One can now give a formal inductive definition of the rearrangement σ , that works in general. For every integer k ≥ 0, a finite set A k of integers and a real number S k are defined. For every k > 0, the induction defines the value σ ( k ), the set A k consists of the values σ ( j ) for j ≤ k and S k is the partial sum of the rearranged series. The definition is as follows:   For k = 0, the induction starts with A 0 empty and S 0 = 0.    For every k ≥ 0, there are two cases: if S k ≤ M , then σ ( k +1) is the smallest integer n ≥ 1 such that n is not in A k and a n ≥ 0; if S k > M , then σ ( k +1) is the smallest integer n ≥ 1 such that n is not in A k and a n < 0. In both cases one sets          A   k  +  1    =    A  k   ∪   {   σ   (   k  +  1   )    }     ;    S   k  +  1    =    S  k   +   a   σ   (   k  +  1   )        .     formulae-sequence     subscript  A    k  1       subscript  A  k      σ    k  1          subscript  S    k  1       subscript  S  k    subscript  a    σ    k  1         A_{k+1}=A_{k}\cup\{\sigma(k+1)\}\,;\quad S_{k+1}=S_{k}+a_{\sigma(k+1)}.     It can be proved, using the reasonings above, that σ is a permutation of the integers and that the permuted series converges to the given real number M .  Generalizations  Sierpiński theorem  In Riemann's theorem, the permutation used for rearranging a conditionally convergent series to obtain a given value in    𝐑  ∪   {  ∞  ,   -  ∞   }       𝐑           \mathbf{R}\cup\{\infty,-\infty\}   may have arbitrarily non-fixed points, i.e. all the indexes of the terms of the series may be rearranged. One may ask if it is possible to rearrange only the indexes in a smaller set so that a conditionally convergent series converges to an arbitrarily taken real number or diverges to (positive or negative) infinity. The answer of this question is positive: Sierpiński proved that is sufficient to rearrange only some strictly positive terms or only some strictly negative terms. 1 2 3  This question have also been explored using the notion of ideals : for instance, in 4 it is proved that is sufficient to rearrange only the indexes in the ideal of sets of asymptotic density zero. In 5 it is proved that also other ideals have this property.  Steinitz's theorem  Given a converging series of complex numbers , several cases can occur when considering the set of possible sums for all series obtained by rearranging (permuting) the terms of that series:   the series may converge unconditionally; then, all rearranged series converge, and have the same sum: the set of sums of the rearranged series reduces to one point;    the series may fail to converge unconditionally; if S denotes the set of sums of those rearranged series that converge, then, either the set S is a line L in the complex plane C , of the form           L  =    {   a  +   t  b    :   t  ∈  𝐑   }   ,  a    ,    b  ∈  𝐂   ,   b  ≠  0     ,     formulae-sequence    L    conditional-set    a    t  b      t  𝐑    a     formulae-sequence    b  𝐂     b  0      L=\{a+tb:t\in\mathbf{R}\},\quad a,b\in\mathbf{C},\ b\neq 0,         or the set S is the whole complex plane C .   More generally, given a converging series of vectors in a finite-dimensional real vector space  E , the set of sums of converging rearranged series is an affine subspace of E .
