   Markup rule      Markup rule   A markup rule refers to the pricing practice of a producer with market power , where a firm charges a fixed mark up over its marginal cost . 1 2  Derivation of the markup rule  Mathematically, the markup rule can be derived for a firm with price-setting power by maximizing the following equation for " Economic Profit ":      π  =     P   (  Q  )    ⋅  Q   -   C   (  Q  )         π     normal-⋅    P  Q   Q     C  Q      \pi=P(Q)\cdot Q-C(Q)      where  Q = quantity sold,  P(Q) = inverse demand function , and thereby the Price at which Q can be sold given the existing Demand   C(Q) = Total (Economic) Cost of producing Q.     π   π   \pi   = Economic Profit   Profit maximization means that the derivative of   π   π   \pi   with respect to Q is set equal to 0. Profit of a firm is given by total revenue (price times quantity sold) minus total cost:          P  ′    (  Q  )   Q   +  P   -    C  ′    (  Q  )     =  0             superscript  P  normal-′   Q  Q   P      superscript  C  normal-′   Q    0    P^{\prime}(Q)Q+P-C^{\prime}(Q)=0      where  Q = quantity sold,  P'(Q) = the partial derivative of the inverse demand function .  C'(Q) = Marginal Cost, or the partial derivative of Total Cost with respect to output.   This yields:          P  ′    (  Q  )    *  Q   +  P   =    C  ′    (  Q  )               superscript  P  normal-′   Q   Q   P      superscript  C  normal-′   Q     P^{\prime}(Q)*Q+P=C^{\prime}(Q)     or "Marginal Revenue" = "Marginal Cost".  (Figure)  Monopoly Price and Output|center|A firm with market power will set a price and production quantity such that marginal cost equals marginal revenue. A competitive firm's marginal revenue is the price it gets for its product, and so it will equate marginal cost to price.        P   (     P  ′    (   Q  /  P   )    +  1   )    =   M  C         P       superscript  P  normal-′     Q  P    1      M  C     P(P^{\prime}(Q/P)+1)=MC     By definition     P  ′    (   Q  /  P   )        superscript  P  normal-′     Q  P     P^{\prime}(Q/P)   is the reciprocal of the price elasticity of demand (or    1  /  ϵ      1  ϵ    1/\epsilon   ). Hence       P   (   1  +   1  /  ϵ    )    =   M  C         P    1    1  ϵ       M  C     P(1+1/{\epsilon})=MC     This gives the markup rule:      P  =    ϵ   ϵ  +  1    M  C       P      ϵ    ϵ  1    M  C     P=\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon+1}MC     or, letting   η   η   \eta   be the reciprocal of the price elasticity of demand,      P  =    1   1  +  η    M  C       P      1    1  η    M  C     P=\frac{1}{1+\eta}MC     Thus a firm with market power chooses the quantity at which the demand price satisfies this rule. Since for a price setting firm    η  <  0      η  0    \eta<0   this means that a firm with market power will charge a price above marginal cost and thus earn a monopoly rent . On the other hand, a competitive firm by definition faces a perfectly elastic demand, hence it believes    η  =  0      η  0    \eta=0   which means that it sets price equal to marginal cost.  The rule also implies that, absent menu costs , a firm with market power will never choose a point on the inelastic portion of its demand curve.
