   Auslander–Reiten theory      Auslander–Reiten theory   In algebra, Auslander–Reiten theory studies the representation theory of Artinian rings using techniques such as Auslander–Reiten sequences (also called almost split sequences ) and Auslander–Reiten quivers . Auslander–Reiten theory was introduced by  and developed by them in several subsequent papers.  For survey articles on Auslander–Reiten theory see , , , and the book . Many of the original papers on Auslander–Reiten theory are reprinted in .  Almost-split sequences  Suppose that R is an Artin algebra. A sequence   0→ A → B → C → 0   of finitely generated left modules over R is called an almost-split sequence (or Auslander–Reiten sequence ) if it has the following properties:   The sequence is not split  C is indecomposable and any homomorphism from an indecomposable module to C that is not an isomorphism factors through B .  A is indecomposable and any homomorphism from A to an indecomposable module that is not an isomorphism factors through B .   For any finitely generated left module C that is indecomposable but not projective there is an almost-split sequence as above, which is unique up to isomorphism. Similarly for any finitely generated left module A that is indecomposable but not injective there is an almost-split sequence as above, which is unique up to isomorphism.  The module A in the almost split sequence is isomorphic to D Tr C , the dual of the transpose of C .  Example  Suppose that R is the ring k [ x ]/( x n ) for a field k and an integer n ≥1. The indecomposable modules are isomorphic to one of k [ x ]/( x m ) for 1≤ m ≤ n , and the only projective one has m = n . The almost split sequences are isomorphic to      0  →    k   [  x  ]    /   (   x  m   )    →     k   [  x  ]    /   (   x   m  +  1    )    ⊕    k   [  x  ]    /   (   x   m  -  1    )     →    k   [  x  ]    /   (   x  m   )    →  0       normal-→  0      k   delimited-[]  x     superscript  x  m      normal-→     direct-sum      k   delimited-[]  x     superscript  x    m  1         k   delimited-[]  x     superscript  x    m  1        normal-→        k   delimited-[]  x     superscript  x  m      normal-→    0     0\rightarrow k[x]/(x^{m})\rightarrow k[x]/(x^{m+1})\oplus k[x]/(x^{m-1})%
