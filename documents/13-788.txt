   Normal crossings      Normal crossings   In algebraic geometry  normal crossings is the property of intersecting geometric objects to do it in a transversal way.  Normal crossing divisors  In algebraic geometry , normal crossing divisors are a class of divisors which generalize the smooth divisors. Intuitively they cross only in a transversal way.  Let A be an algebraic variety , and    Z  =    ∪  i    Z  i        Z    subscript   i    subscript  Z  i      Z=\cup_{i}Z_{i}   a reduced Cartier divisor , with    Z  i     subscript  Z  i    Z_{i}   its irreducible components. Then Z is called a smooth normal crossing divisor if either   (i) A is a curve , or  (ii) all    Z  i     subscript  Z  i    Z_{i}   are smooth, and for each component    Z  k     subscript  Z  k    Z_{k}   ,      (   Z  -   Z  k    )   |    Z  k      evaluated-at    Z   subscript  Z  k     subscript  Z  k     (Z-Z_{k})|_{Z_{k}}   is a smooth normal crossing divisor.   Equivalently, one says that a reduced divisor has normal crossings if each point étale locally looks like the intersection of coordinate hyperplanes.  Normal crossings singularity  In algebraic geometry a '''normal crossings ''' singularity is a point in an algebraic variety that is locally isomorphic to a normal crossings divisor.  Simple normal crossings singularity  In algebraic geometry a simple normal crossings singularity is a point in an algebraic variety , the latter having smooth  irreducible components , that is locally isomorphic to a normal crossings divisor.  Examples   The normal crossing points in the algebraic variety called the Whitney umbrella are not simple normal crossings singularities.  The origin in the algebraic variety defined by     x  y   =  0        x  y   0    xy=0   is a simple normal crossings singularity. The variety itself, seen as a subvariety of the two-dimensional affine plane is an example of a normal crossings divisor.
