Normal crossings




Normal crossings

In algebraic geometry normal crossings is the property of intersecting geometric objects to do it in a transversal way.
Normal crossing divisors
In algebraic geometry, normal crossing divisors are a class of divisors which generalize the smooth divisors. Intuitively they cross only in a transversal way.
Let A be an algebraic variety, and 
 
 
 
  a reduced Cartier divisor, with 
 
 
 
  its irreducible components. Then Z is called a smooth normal crossing divisor if either

(i) A is a curve, or
 
(ii) all 
 
 
 
  are smooth, and for each component 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a smooth normal crossing divisor.
 

Equivalently, one says that a reduced divisor has normal crossings if each point Ã©tale locally looks like the intersection of coordinate hyperplanes.
Normal crossings singularity
In algebraic geometry a '''normal crossings ''' singularity is a point in an algebraic variety that is locally isomorphic to a normal crossings divisor.
Simple normal crossings singularity
In algebraic geometry a simple normal crossings singularity is a point in an algebraic variety, the latter having smooth irreducible components, that is locally isomorphic to a normal crossings divisor.
Examples

The normal crossing points in the algebraic variety called the Whitney umbrella are not simple normal crossings singularities.
The origin in the algebraic variety defined by 
 
 
 
  is a simple normal crossings singularity. The variety itself, seen as a subvariety of the two-dimensional affine plane is an example of a normal crossings divisor.
