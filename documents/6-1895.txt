Nearest integer function

 In computer science, the nearest integer function of real number x denoted variously by 
 
 
 
 ,1

 
 , 
 
 
 
 ,2 nint(x), or Round(x), is a function which returns the nearest integer to x. To avoid ambiguity when operating on half-integers, a rounding rule must be chosen. On most computer implementations, the selected rule is to round half-integers to the nearest even integerâ€”for example,































etc.
 

This is in accordance with the IEEE 754 standards and helps reduce bias in the result.
There are many other possible rules for tie breaking when rounding a half integer include rounding up, rounding down, rounding to or away from zero, or random rounding up or down.
