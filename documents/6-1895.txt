   Nearest integer function      Nearest integer function   In computer science , the nearest integer function of real number  x denoted variously by    [  x  ]     delimited-[]  x    [x]   , 1     ⌊  x  ⌉     delimited-⌊⌉  x    \lfloor x\rceil   ,    ∥  x  ∥     norm  x    \|x\|   , 2 nint( x ), or Round( x ), is a function which returns the nearest integer to x . To avoid ambiguity when operating on half-integers , a rounding rule must be chosen. On most computer implementations, the selected rule is to round half-integers to the nearest even integer —for example,       [  1.25  ]   =  1       delimited-[]  1.25   1    [1.25]=1          [  1.50  ]   =  2       delimited-[]  1.50   2    [1.50]=2          [  1.75  ]   =  2       delimited-[]  1.75   2    [1.75]=2          [  2.25  ]   =  2       delimited-[]  2.25   2    [2.25]=2          [  2.50  ]   =  2       delimited-[]  2.50   2    [2.50]=2          [  2.75  ]   =  3       delimited-[]  2.75   3    [2.75]=3          [  3.25  ]   =  3       delimited-[]  3.25   3    [3.25]=3          [  3.50  ]   =  4       delimited-[]  3.50   4    [3.50]=4          [  3.75  ]   =  4       delimited-[]  3.75   4    [3.75]=4          [  4.50  ]   =  4       delimited-[]  4.50   4    [4.50]=4      etc.   This is in accordance with the IEEE 754 standards and helps reduce bias in the result.  There are many other possible rules for tie breaking when rounding a half integer include rounding up, rounding down, rounding to or away from zero, or random rounding up or down.
