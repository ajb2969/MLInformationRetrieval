   Reeb vector field      Reeb vector field   In mathematics, the Reeb vector field , named after the French mathematician Georges Reeb , is a notion that appears in various domains of contact geometry including:   in a contact manifold , given a contact 1-form   α   α   \alpha   , the Reeb vector field satisfies     R  ∈    ker   d  α    ,    α   (  R  )    =  1      formulae-sequence    R    ker  d  α        α  R   1     R\in\mathrm{ker}\ d\alpha,\ \alpha(R)=1   ,  in particular, in the context of Sasakian manifold#The Reeb vector field .
