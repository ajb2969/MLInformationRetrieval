   Generalized Wiener process      Generalized Wiener process   In statistics , a generalized Wiener process (named after Norbert Wiener ) is a continuous time  random walk with drift and random jumps at every point in time. Formally:       a   (  x  ,  t  )   d  t   +   b   (  x  ,  t  )   η    d  t           a   x  t   d  t     b   x  t   η      d  t       a(x,t)dt+b(x,t)\eta\sqrt{dt}     where a and b are deterministic functions, t is a continuous index for time, x is a set of exogenous variables that may change with time, dt is a differential in time, and η is a random draw from a standard normal distribution at each instant.
