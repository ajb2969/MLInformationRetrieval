   Born–Landé equation      Born–Landé equation   The Born–Landé equation is a means of calculating the lattice energy of a crystalline ionic compound . In 1918 1  Max Born and Alfred Landé proposed that the lattice energy could be derived from the electrostatic potential of the ionic lattice and a repulsive potential energy term. 2      E  =   -      N  A   M   z  +    z  -    e  2     4  π   ϵ  0    r  0      (   1  -   1  n    )         E           subscript  N  A   M   superscript  z     superscript  z     superscript  e  2      4  π   subscript  ϵ  0    subscript  r  0       1    1  n        E=-\frac{N_{A}Mz^{+}z^{-}e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r_{0}}\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)   where:   N A = Avogadro constant ;  M = Madelung constant , relating to the geometry of the crystal;  z + = charge number of cation  z − = charge number of anion  e = elementary charge , 1.6022     ×    10  −   19       absent     superscript  10  normal-−   19     \times 10^{−}19    C  ε 0 = permittivity of free space   4π ε 0 = 1.112     ×    10  −   10       absent     superscript  10  normal-−   10     \times 10^{−}10   C 2 /(J·m)   r 0 = distance to closest ion  n = Born exponent, typically a number between 5 and 12, determined experimentally by measuring the compressibility of the solid, or derived theoretically. 3   Derivation  The ionic lattice is modeled as an assembly of hard elastic spheres which are compressed together by the mutual attraction of the electrostatic charges on the ions. They achieve the observed equilibrium distance apart due to a balancing short range repulsion.  Electrostatic potential  The electrostatic potential energy,    E  pair     subscript  E  pair    E_{\text{pair}}   , between a pair of ions of equal and opposite charge is:       E  pair   =   -     z  2    e  2     4  π   ϵ  0   r          subscript  E  pair          superscript  z  2    superscript  e  2      4  π   subscript  ϵ  0   r       E_{\text{pair}}=-\frac{z^{2}e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r}   where     z   z   z   = magnitude of charge on one ion     e   e   e   = elementary charge, 1.6022     ×    10  −   19       absent     superscript  10  normal-−   19     \times 10^{−}19    C      ϵ  0     subscript  ϵ  0    \epsilon_{0}   = permittivity of free space        4  π   ϵ  0       4  π   subscript  ϵ  0     4\pi\epsilon_{0}   = 1.112     ×    10  −   10       absent     superscript  10  normal-−   10     \times 10^{−}10   C²/(J m)       r   r   r   = distance separating the ion centers   For a simple lattice consisting ions with equal and opposite charge in a 1:1 ratio, interactions between one ion and all other lattice ions need to be summed to calculate    E  M     subscript  E  M    E_{M}   , sometimes called the Madelung or lattice energy:       E  M   =   -     z  2    e  2   M    4  π   ϵ  0   r          subscript  E  M          superscript  z  2    superscript  e  2   M     4  π   subscript  ϵ  0   r       E_{M}=-\frac{z^{2}e^{2}M}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r}   where     M   M   M   = Madelung constant , which is related to the geometry of the crystal     r   r   r   = closest distance between two ions of opposite charge  Repulsive term  Born and Lande suggested that a repulsive interaction between the lattice ions would be proportional to    1  /   r  n       1   superscript  r  n     1/r^{n}   so that the repulsive energy term,    E  R     subscript  E  R    E_{R}   , would be expressed:        E   R   =   B   r  n         subscript  E  R     B   superscript  r  n      \,E_{R}=\frac{B}{r^{n}}   where     B   B   B   = constant scaling the strength of the repulsive interaction     r   r   r   = closest distance between two ions of opposite charge     n   n   n   = Born exponent, a number between 5 and 12 expressing the steepness of the repulsive barrier  Total energy  The total intensive potential energy of an ion in the lattice can therefore be expressed as the sum of the Madelung and repulsive potentials:       E   (  r  )    =    -     z  2    e  2   M    4  π   ϵ  0   r     +   B   r  n           E  r            superscript  z  2    superscript  e  2   M     4  π   subscript  ϵ  0   r       B   superscript  r  n       E(r)=-\frac{z^{2}e^{2}M}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r}+\frac{B}{r^{n}}     Minimizing this energy with respect to   r   r   r   yields the equilibrium separation    r  0     subscript  r  0    r_{0}   in terms of the unknown constant   B   B   B   :        d  E    d  r          normal-d  E     normal-d  r     \displaystyle\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}r}     Evaluating the minimum intensive potential energy and substituting the expression for   B   B   B   in terms of    r  0     subscript  r  0    r_{0}   yields the Born–Landé equation:       E   (   r  0   )    =   -     M   z  2    e  2     4  π   ϵ  0    r  0      (   1  -   1  n    )           E   subscript  r  0            M   superscript  z  2    superscript  e  2      4  π   subscript  ϵ  0    subscript  r  0       1    1  n        E(r_{0})=-\frac{Mz^{2}e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r_{0}}\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)     Calculated lattice energies  The Born–Landé equation gives a reasonable fit to the lattice energy 4      Compound   Calculated Lattice Energy   Experimental Lattice Energy       NaCl   −756 kJ/mol   −787 kJ/mol     LiF   −1007 kJ/mol   −1046 kJ/mol     CaCl 2   −2170 kJ/mol   −2255 kJ/mol     Born Exponent  The Born exponent is typically between 5 and 12.
