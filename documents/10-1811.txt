   Aliphatic aldoxime dehydratase      Aliphatic aldoxime dehydratase   In enzymology , an aliphatic aldoxime dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an aliphatic aldoxime   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   an aliphatic nitrile + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , aliphatic aldoxime , and two products , aliphatic nitrile and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the "catch-all" class of lyases that do not fit into any other sub-class. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aliphatic aldoxime hydro-lyase (aliphatic-nitrile-forming) . Other names in common use include OxdA , and aliphatic aldoxime hydro-lyase .
