   Fernique's theorem      Fernique's theorem   In mathematics — specifically, in measure theory — Fernique's theorem is a result about Gaussian measures on Banach spaces . It extends the finite-dimensional result that a Gaussian random variable has exponential tails. The result was proved in 1970 by the mathematician  Xavier Fernique .  Statement of the theorem  Let ( X , || ||) be a separable Banach space. Let μ be a centered Gaussian measure on X , i.e. a probability measure defined on the Borel sets of X such that, for every bounded linear functional  ℓ : X → R , the push-forward measure  ℓ ∗ μ defined on the Borel sets of R by         (    ℓ  ∗   μ   )    (  A  )    =   μ   (    ℓ   -  1     (  A  )    )     ,           subscript  normal-ℓ  normal-∗   μ   A     μ     superscript  normal-ℓ    1    A      (\ell_{\ast}\mu)(A)=\mu(\ell^{-1}(A)),     is a Gaussian measure (a normal distribution ) with zero mean . Then there exists α > 0 such that         ∫  X     exp   (   α    ∥  x  ∥   2    )    d  μ   (  x  )     <   +  ∞    .        subscript   X         α   superscript   norm  x   2     normal-d  μ  x          \int_{X}\exp(\alpha\|x\|^{2})\,\mathrm{d}\mu(x)<+\infty.     A fortiori , μ (equivalently, any X -valued random variable G whose law is μ ) has moments of all orders: for all k ≥ 0,        𝔼   [    ∥  G  ∥   k   ]    =    ∫  X       ∥  x  ∥   k    d  μ   (  x  )     <   +  ∞    .          𝔼   delimited-[]   superscript   norm  G   k       subscript   X      superscript   norm  x   k   normal-d  μ  x                \mathbb{E}[\|G\|^{k}]=\int_{X}\|x\|^{k}\,\mathrm{d}\mu(x)<+\infty.
