   Arnold–Givental conjecture      Arnold–Givental conjecture   The Arnold–Givental conjecture , named after Vladimir Arnold and Alexander Givental , is a statement on Lagrangian submanifolds . It gives a lower bound in terms of the Betti numbers of   L   L   L   on the number of intersection points of   L   L   L   with a Hamiltonian isotopic Lagrangian submanifold which intersects   L   L   L   transversally.  Let be a smooth family of Hamiltonian functions of   M   M   M   and denote by the one-time map of the flow of the Hamiltonian vector field of . Assume that   L   L   L   and intersect transversally. Then the number of intersection points of   L   L   L   and can be estimated from below by the sum of the Betti numbers of   L   L   L   , i.e.       |   L  ∩    φ  H    (  L  )     |   ≥    ∑   k  =  0   n     b  k    (  L  ;   𝐙  2   )             L     subscript  φ  H   L       superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  b  k    L   subscript  𝐙  2        \left|L\cap\varphi_{H}(L)\right|\geq\sum_{k=0}^{n}b_{k}\left(L;\mathbf{Z}_{2}\right)     Up to now, the Arnold–Givental conjecture could only be proven under some additional assumptions.
