Arnold–Givental conjecture

The Arnold–Givental conjecture, named after Vladimir Arnold and Alexander Givental, is a statement on Lagrangian submanifolds. It gives a lower bound in terms of the Betti numbers of 
 
 
 
  on the number of intersection points of 
 
 
 
  with a Hamiltonian isotopic Lagrangian submanifold which intersects 
 
 
 
  transversally.
Let  be a smooth family of Hamiltonian functions of 
 
 
 
 
  and denote by  the one-time map of the flow of the Hamiltonian vector field  of . Assume that 
 
 
 
  and  intersect transversally. Then the number of intersection points of 
 
 
 
  and  can be estimated from below by the sum of the  Betti numbers of 
 
 
 
 , i.e.



Up to now, the Arnold–Givental conjecture could only be proven under some additional assumptions.
