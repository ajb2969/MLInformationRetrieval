Uniformly Cauchy sequence

In mathematics, a sequence of functions

 
  from a set S to a metric space M is said to be uniformly Cauchy if:

For all 
 
 
 
 , there exists 
 
 
 
  such that for all 
 
 

 
  whenever 
 
 
 
 .

Another way of saying this is that 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 , where the uniform distance 
 
 
 
  between two functions is defined by



Convergence criteria
A sequence of functions {fn} from S to M is pointwise Cauchy if, for each x ∈ S, the sequence {fn(x)} is a Cauchy sequence in M. This is a weaker condition than being uniformly Cauchy.
In general a sequence can be pointwise Cauchy and not pointwise convergent, or it can be uniformly Cauchy and not uniformly convergent. Nevertheless, if the metric space M is complete, then any pointwise Cauchy sequence converges pointwise to a function from S to M. Similarly, any uniformly Cauchy sequence will tend uniformly to such a function.
The uniform Cauchy property is frequently used when the S is not just a set, but a topological space, and M is a complete metric space. The following theorem holds:

Let S be a topological space and M a complete metric space. Then any uniformly Cauchy sequence of continuous functions fn : S → M tends uniformly to a unique continuous function f : S → M.

Generalization to uniform spaces
A sequence of functions

 
  from a set S to a metric space U is said to be uniformly Cauchy if:

For all 
 
 
 
  and for any entourage

 
 , there exists 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  whenever 
 
 
 
 .
