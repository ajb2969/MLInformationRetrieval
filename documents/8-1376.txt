   Uniformly Cauchy sequence      Uniformly Cauchy sequence   In mathematics , a sequence of functions     {   f  n   }      subscript  f  n     \{f_{n}\}   from a set S to a metric space M is said to be uniformly Cauchy if:   For all    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   , there exists    N  >  0      N  0    N>0   such that for all    x  ∈  S      x  S    x\in S        d   (    f  n    (  x  )    ,    f  m    (  x  )    )    <  ε        d      subscript  f  n   x      subscript  f  m   x     ε    d(f_{n}(x),f_{m}(x))<\varepsilon   whenever     m  ,  n   >  N       m  n   N    m,n>N   .   Another way of saying this is that      d  u    (   f  n   ,   f  m   )    →  0     normal-→     subscript  d  u     subscript  f  n    subscript  f  m     0    d_{u}(f_{n},f_{m})\to 0   as     m  ,  n   →  ∞     normal-→   m  n      m,n\to\infty   , where the uniform distance    d  u     subscript  d  u    d_{u}   between two functions is defined by         d  u    (  f  ,  g  )    :=    sup   x  ∈  S     d   (   f   (  x  )    ,   g   (  x  )    )      .     assign     subscript  d  u    f  g      subscript  supremum    x  S      d     f  x     g  x        d_{u}(f,g):=\sup_{x\in S}d(f(x),g(x)).     Convergence criteria  A sequence of functions { f n } from S to M is pointwise Cauchy if, for each x ∈ S , the sequence { f n ( x )} is a Cauchy sequence in M . This is a weaker condition than being uniformly Cauchy.  In general a sequence can be pointwise Cauchy and not pointwise convergent, or it can be uniformly Cauchy and not uniformly convergent. Nevertheless, if the metric space M is complete , then any pointwise Cauchy sequence converges pointwise to a function from S to M . Similarly, any uniformly Cauchy sequence will tend uniformly to such a function.  The uniform Cauchy property is frequently used when the S is not just a set, but a topological space , and M is a complete metric space. The following theorem holds:   Let S be a topological space and M a complete metric space. Then any uniformly Cauchy sequence of continuous functions  f n : S → M tends uniformly to a unique continuous function f : S → M .   Generalization to uniform spaces  A sequence of functions     {   f  n   }      subscript  f  n     \{f_{n}\}   from a set S to a metric space U is said to be uniformly Cauchy if:   For all    x  ∈  S      x  S    x\in S   and for any entourage    ε   ε   \varepsilon   , there exists    N  >  0      N  0    N>0   such that     d   (    f  n    (  x  )    ,    f  m    (  x  )    )    <  ε        d      subscript  f  n   x      subscript  f  m   x     ε    d(f_{n}(x),f_{m}(x))<\varepsilon   whenever     m  ,  n   >  N       m  n   N    m,n>N   .
