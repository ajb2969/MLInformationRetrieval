Decision-theoretic rough sets

In the mathematical theory of decisions, decision-theoretic rough sets (DTRS) is a probabilistic extension of rough set classification. First created in 1990 by Dr. Yiyu Yao,1 the extension makes use of loss functions to derive 

 and 

 region parameters. Like rough sets, the lower and upper approximations of a set are used.
Definitions
The following contains the basic principles of decision-theoretic rough sets.
Conditional risk
Using the Bayesian decision procedure, the decision-theoretic rough set (DTRS) approach allows for minimum-risk decision making based on observed evidence. Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite set of 
 
 
 
 
  possible actions and let 
 
 
 
  be a finite set of 
 
 
 
  states. 
 
 
 
  is calculated as the conditional probability of an object 
 
 
 
  being in state 
 
 
 
 
  given the object description 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  denotes the loss, or cost, for performing action 
 
 
 
  when the state is 
 
 
 
 . The expected loss (conditional risk) associated with taking action 
 
 
 
 
  is given by:



Object classification with the approximation operators can be fitted into the Bayesian decision framework. The set of actions is given by 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 
  represent the three actions in classifying an object into POS(
 
 
 
 ), NEG(
 
 
 
 ), and BND(
 
 
 
 ) respectively. To indicate whether an element is in 
 
 
 
  or not in 
 
 
 
 
 , the set of states is given by 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  denote the loss incurred by taking action 
 
 
 
  when an object belongs to 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
 
  denote the loss incurred by take the same action when the object belongs to 
 
 
 
 .
Loss functions
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the loss function for classifying an object in 
 
 
 
  into the POS region, 
 
 
 
  denote the loss function for classifying an object in 
 
 
 
 
  into the BND region, and let 
 
 
 
  denote the loss function for classifying an object in 
 
 
 
  into the NEG region. A loss function 
 
 
 
  denotes the loss of classifying an object that does not belong to 
 
 
 
  into the regions specified by 
 
 
 
 
 .
Taking individual can be associated with the expected loss 
 
 
 
 actions and can be expressed as:









where 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , or 
 
 
 
 .
Minimum-risk decision rules
If we consider the loss functions 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the following decision rules are formulated (P, N, B):

P: If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , decide POS(
 
 
 
 );
N: If 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , decide NEG(
 
 
 
 );
B: If 
 
 
 
 , decide BND(
 
 
 
 );

where,









The 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 
  values define the three different regions, giving us an associated risk for classifying an object. When 
 
 
 
 , we get 
 
 
 
  and can simplify (P, N, B) into (P1, N1, B1):

P1: If 
 
 
 
 , decide POS(
 
 
 
 );
N1: If 
 
 
 
 
 , decide NEG(
 
 
 
 );
B1: If 
 
 
 
 , decide BND(
 
 
 
 ).

When 
 
 
 
 , we can simplify the rules (P-B) into (P2-B2), which divide the regions based solely on 
 
 
 
 
 :

P2: If 
 
 
 
 , decide POS(
 
 
 
 );
N2: If 
 
 
 
 , decide NEG(
 
 
 
 );
B2: If 
 
 
 
 
 , decide BND(
 
 
 
 ).

Data mining, feature selection, information retrieval, and classifications are just some of the applications in which the DTRS approach has been successfully used.
