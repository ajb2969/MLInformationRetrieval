Interval order

In mathematics, especially order theory, the interval order for a collection of intervals on the real line is the partial order corresponding to their left-to-right precedence relation—one interval, I1, being considered less than another, I2, if I1 is completely to the left of I2. More formally, a poset

 
 
  is an interval order if and only if there exists a bijection from 
 
 
 
  to a set of real intervals, so 
 
 
 
 , such that for any 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 
  exactly when 
 
 
 
 . Such posets may be equivalently characterized as those with no induced subposet isomorphic to the pair of two element chains, the 
 
 
 
  free posets .1
The subclass of interval orders obtained by restricting the intervals to those of unit length, so they all have the form 
 
 
 
 , is precisely the semiorders.
The complement of the comparability graph of an interval order (
 
 
 
 , ≤) is the interval graph

 
 
 .
Interval orders should not be confused with the interval-containment orders, which are the containment orders on intervals on the real line (equivalently, the orders of dimension ≤ 2).
Interval dimension
The interval dimension of a partial order can be defined as the minimal number of interval order extensions realizing this order, in a similar way to the definition of the order dimension which uses linear extensions. The interval dimension of an order is always less than its order dimension,2 but interval orders with high dimensions are known to exist. While the problem of determining the order dimension of general partial orders is known to be NP-complete, the complexity of determining the order dimension of an interval order is unknown.3
Combinatorics
In addition to being isomorphic to 
 
 
 
  free posets, unlabeled interval orders on 
 
 
 
  are also in bijection with a subset of fixed point free involutions on ordered sets with cardinality 
 
 
 
  .4 These are the involutions with no left or right neighbor nestings where, for 
 
 
 
  an involution on 
 
 
 
 
 , a left nesting is an 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and a right nesting is an 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
Such involutions, according to semi-length, have ordinary generating function 5

 
 
 .
Hence the number of unlabeled interval orders of size 
 
 
 
  is given by the coefficient of 
 
 
 
  in the expansion of 
 
 
 
 .
