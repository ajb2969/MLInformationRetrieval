   Interval order      Interval order   In mathematics , especially order theory , the interval order for a collection of intervals on the real line is the partial order corresponding to their left-to-right precedence relation—one interval, I 1 , being considered less than another, I 2 , if I 1 is completely to the left of I 2 . More formally, a poset     P  =   (  X  ,  ≤  )       P   X      P=(X,\leq)   is an interval order if and only if there exists a bijection from   X   X   X   to a set of real intervals, so     x  i   ↦   (   ℓ  i   ,   r  i   )      maps-to   subscript  x  i     subscript  normal-ℓ  i    subscript  r  i      x_{i}\mapsto(\ell_{i},r_{i})   , such that for any      x  i   ,   x  j    ∈  X        subscript  x  i    subscript  x  j    X    x_{i},x_{j}\in X   we have     x  i   <   x  j        subscript  x  i    subscript  x  j     x_{i}   in   P   P   P   exactly when     r  i   <   ℓ  j        subscript  r  i    subscript  normal-ℓ  j     r_{i}<\ell_{j}   . Such posets may be equivalently characterized as those with no induced subposet isomorphic to the pair of two element chains, the    (   2  +  2   )      2  2    (2+2)   free posets . 1  The subclass of interval orders obtained by restricting the intervals to those of unit length, so they all have the form    (   ℓ  i   ,    ℓ  i   +  1   )      subscript  normal-ℓ  i      subscript  normal-ℓ  i   1     (\ell_{i},\ell_{i}+1)   , is precisely the semiorders .  The complement of the comparability graph of an interval order (   X   X   X   , ≤) is the interval graph     (  X  ,  ∩  )     X     (X,\cap)   .  Interval orders should not be confused with the interval-containment orders, which are the containment orders on intervals on the real line (equivalently, the orders of dimension ≤ 2).  Interval dimension  The interval dimension of a partial order can be defined as the minimal number of interval order extensions realizing this order, in a similar way to the definition of the order dimension which uses linear extensions . The interval dimension of an order is always less than its order dimension , 2 but interval orders with high dimensions are known to exist. While the problem of determining the order dimension of general partial orders is known to be NP-complete , the complexity of determining the order dimension of an interval order is unknown. 3  Combinatorics  In addition to being isomorphic to    (   2  +  2   )      2  2    (2+2)   free posets, unlabeled interval orders on    [  n  ]     delimited-[]  n    [n]   are also in bijection with a subset of fixed point free involutions on ordered sets with cardinality    2  n      2  n    2n   . 4 These are the involutions with no left or right neighbor nestings where, for   f   f   f   an involution on    [   2  n   ]     delimited-[]    2  n     [2n]   , a left nesting is an    i  ∈   [   2  n   ]       i   delimited-[]    2  n      i\in[2n]   such that    i  <   i  +  1   <   f   (   i  +  1   )    <   f   (  i  )          i    i  1          f    i  1           f  i      i   and a right nesting is an    i  ∈   [   2  n   ]       i   delimited-[]    2  n      i\in[2n]   such that     f   (  i  )    <   f   (   i  +  1   )    <  i  <   i  +  1           f  i     f    i  1         i         i  1      f(i)   .  Such involutions, according to semi-length, have ordinary generating function 5      F   (  t  )    =    ∑   n  ≥  0      ∏   i  =  1   n    (   1  -    (   1  -  t   )   i    )           F  t     subscript     n  0      superscript   subscript  product    i  1    n     1   superscript    1  t   i        F(t)=\sum_{n\geq 0}\prod_{i=1}^{n}(1-(1-t)^{i})   .  Hence the number of unlabeled interval orders of size   n   n   n   is given by the coefficient of    t  n     superscript  t  n    t^{n}   in the expansion of    F   (  t  )       F  t    F(t)   .  1, 2, 5, 15, 53, 217, 1014, 5335, 31240, 201608, 1422074, 10886503, 89903100, 796713190, 7541889195, 75955177642, …  Notes  References       .
