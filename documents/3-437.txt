   Multimagic square      Multimagic square   In mathematics , a P -multimagic square (also known as a satanic square ) is a magic square that remains magic even if all its numbers are replaced by their k th power for 1 ≤ k ≤ P . Thus, a magic square is bimagic if it is 2-multimagic, and trimagic if it is 3-multimagic; tetramagic for 4-multimagic; and pentamagic for a 5-multimagic square.  Constants for normal squares  If the squares are normal, the constant for the power-squares can be determined as follows:  Bimagic series totals for bimagic squares are also linked to the square-pyramidal number sequence is as follows :- Squares 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, .... Sum of Squares 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, 91, 140, 204, 285, ...  )number of units in a square-based pyramid) The bimagic series is the 1st, 4th, 9th in this series (divided by 1, 2, 3, n) etc. so values for the rows and columns in order-1, order-2, order-3 Bimagic squares would be 1, 15, 95, 374, 1105, 2701, 5775, 11180, ...  The trimagic series would be related in the same way to the hyper-pyramidal sequence of nested cubes. Cubes 0, 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, ... Sum of Cubes 0, 1, 9, 36, 100, ... Value for Trimagic squares 1, 50, 675, 4624, ...  Similarly the tetramagic sequence 4-Power 0, 1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, ... Sum of 4-Power 0, 1, 17, 98, 354, 979, 2275, ... Sums for Tetramagic squares 0, 1, 177, ...  Bimagic square  The first known bimagic square has order 8 and magic constant 260 and a bimagic constant of 11180.  It has been conjectured by Bensen and Jacoby that no nontrivial bimagic squares of order less than 8 exist. This was shown for magic squares containing the elements 1 to n 2 by Boyer and Trump.  However, J. R. Hendricks was able to show in 1998 that no bimagic square of order 3 exists, save for the trivial bimagic square containing the same number nine times. The proof is fairly simple: let the following be our bimagic square.     a  b  c    d  e  f    g  h  i       It is well known that a property of magic squares is that $a+i=2e$ . Similarly, $a^2+i^2=2e^2$ . Therefore $(a-i)^2=2(a^2+i^2)-(a+i)^2=4e^2-4e^2=0$ . It follows that $a=e=i$ . The same holds for all lines going through the center.  For 4×4 squares, Luke Pebody was able to show by similar methods that the only 4×4 bimagic squares (up to symmetry) are of the form      a  b  c  d    c  d  a  b    d  c  b  a    b  a  d  c      or      a  a  b  b    b  b  a  a    a  a  b  b    b  b  a  a      An 8×8 bimagic square.      16  41  36  5  27  62  55  18    26  63  54  19  13  44  33  8    1  40  45  12  22  51  58  31    23  50  59  30  4  37  48  9    38  3  10  47  49  24  29  60    52  21  32  57  39  2  11  46    43  14  7  34  64  25  20  53    61  28  17  56  42  15  6  35      Nontrivial bimagic squares are now (2010) known for any order from eight to 64. Li Wen of China created the first known bimagic squares of orders 34, 37, 38, 41, 43, 46, 47, 53, 58, 59, 61, 62 filling the gaps of the last unknown orders.  Trimagic square  Trimagic squares of orders 12, 32, 64, 81 and 128 have been discovered so far; the only known trimagic square of order 12, given below, was found in June 2002 by German  mathematician  Walter Trump .      1  22  33  41  62  66  79  83  104  112  123  144    9  119  45  115  107  93  52  38  30  100  26  136    75  141  35  48  57  14  131  88  97  110  4  70    74  8  106  49  12  43  102  133  96  39  137  71    140  101  124  42  60  37  108  85  103  21  44  5    122  76  142  86  67  126  19  78  59  3  69  23    55  27  95  135  130  89  56  15  10  50  118  90    132  117  68  91  11  99  46  134  54  77  28  13    73  64  2  121  109  32  113  36  24  143  81  72    58  98  84  116  138  16  129  7  29  61  47  87    80  34  105  6  92  127  18  53  139  40  111  65    51  63  31  20  25  128  17  120  125  114  82  94      Higher order  The first 4-magic square, of order 512, was constructed in May 2001 by André Viricel and Christian Boyer .  The first 5-magic square, of order 1024 arrived about one month later, in June 2001 again by Viricel and Boyer. They also presented a smaller 4-magic square of order 256 in January 2003. Another 5-magic square, of order 729, was constructed in June 2003 by Chinese  mathematician Li Wen.
