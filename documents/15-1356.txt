   5-Methyltetrahydrofolate:corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein Co-methyltransferase      5-Methyltetrahydrofolate:corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein Co-methyltransferase   5-methyltetrahydrofolate:corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein Co-methyltransferase (, acsE (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name 5-methyltetrahydrofolate:corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein methyltransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   [Methyl-Co(III) corrinoid Fe-S protein] + tetrahydrofolate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a [Co(I) corrinoid Fe-S protein] + 5-methyltetrahydrofolate   This enzyme catalyses the transfer of a methyl group from the N 5 position of methyltetrahydrofolate to the 5-methoxybenzimidazolylcobamide cofactor of a corrinoid/Fe-S protein.
