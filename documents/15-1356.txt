5-Methyltetrahydrofolate:corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein Co-methyltransferase

5-methyltetrahydrofolate:corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein Co-methyltransferase (, acsE (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 5-methyltetrahydrofolate:corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein methyltransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

[Methyl-Co(III) corrinoid Fe-S protein] + tetrahydrofolate

 
  a [Co(I) corrinoid Fe-S protein] + 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
 

This enzyme catalyses the transfer of a methyl group from the N5 position of methyltetrahydrofolate to the 5-methoxybenzimidazolylcobamide cofactor of a corrinoid/Fe-S protein.
