   NADPH dehydrogenase (quinone)      NADPH dehydrogenase (quinone)   In enzymology , a NADPH dehydrogenase (quinone) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   NADPH + H + + acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   NADP + + reduced acceptor   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are NADPH , H + , and acceptor , whereas its two products are NADP + and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on NADH or NADPH with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is NADPH:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (quinone) , dehydrogenase , NADPH oxidase , and NADPH2 dehydrogenase (quinone) . It has 2 cofactors : FAD , and Flavoprotein . Several compounds are known to inhibit this enzyme , including Folate , and Dicumarol .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
