Branching theorem

In mathematics, the branching theorem is a theorem about Riemann surfaces. Intuitively, it states that every non-constant holomorphic function is locally a polynomial.
Statement of the theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be Riemann surfaces, and let 
 
 
 
  be a non-constant holomorphic map. Fix a point 
 
 
 
  and set 
 
 
 
 . Then there exist 
 
 
 
  and charts

 
  on 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  such that



 
 ; and


 
  is 
 
 


This theorem gives rise to several definitions:

We call 
 
 
 
  the ''[[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity

]]'' of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 . Some authors denote this 
 
 
 
 .

If 
 
 
 
 , the point 
 
 
 
  is called a branch point of 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  has no branch points, it is called unbranched. See also unramified morphism.
