   Forward scattering alignment      Forward scattering alignment   The Forward Scattering Alignment (FSA) is a coordinate system used in coherent electromagnetic scattering .  The coordinate system is defined from the viewpoint of the electromagnetic wave, before and after scattering. The FSA is most commonly used in optics , specifically when working with Jones Calculus because the electromagnetic wave is typically followed through a series of optical components that represent separate scattering events.  FSA gives rise to regular eigenvalue equations . The general alternative coordinate system in electromagnetic scattering is the Back Scattering Alignment (BSA) which is primarily used in radar . Both coordinate systems contain essentially the same information and meaning, and thus a scattering matrix can be transformed from one to the other by use of the matrix,       S   F  S  A    =    [     1    0      0     -  1      ]    S   B  S  A          subscript  S    F  S  A        1  0    0    1      subscript  S    B  S  A       S_{FSA}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\
