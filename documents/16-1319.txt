Incidence (graph)

In graph theory, an incidence is a pair 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a vertex and 
 
 
 
  is an edge incident to 
 
 
 
 .
Two distinct incidences 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are adjacent if and only if 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 .
An incidence coloring of a graph 
 
 
 
  is an assignment of a color to each incidence of G in such a way that adjacent incidences get distinct colors. It is equivalent to a strong edge coloring of the graph obtained by subdivising once each edge of 
 
 
 
 .
