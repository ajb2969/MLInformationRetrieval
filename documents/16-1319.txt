   Incidence (graph)      Incidence (graph)   In graph theory , an incidence is a pair    (  u  ,  e  )     u  e    (u,e)   where   u   u   u   is a vertex and   e   e   e   is an edge incident to   u   u   u   .  Two distinct incidences    (  u  ,  e  )     u  e    (u,e)   and    (  v  ,  f  )     v  f    (v,f)   are adjacent if and only if    u  =  v      u  v    u=v   ,    e  =  f      e  f    e=f   or     u  v   =  e        u  v   e    uv=e   or   f   f   f   .  An incidence coloring of a graph   G   G   G   is an assignment of a color to each incidence of G in such a way that adjacent incidences get distinct colors. It is equivalent to a strong edge coloring of the graph obtained by subdivising once each edge of   G   G   G   .  References  |The Incidence Coloring Page , by Ã‰ric Sopena.
