Trypanothione-disulfide reductase

In enzymology, a trypanothione-disulfide reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

trypanothione + NADP+

 
  trypanothione disulfide + NADPH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are trypanothione and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are trypanothione disulfide, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is trypanothione:NADP+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include trypanothione reductase, and NADPH2:trypanothione oxidoreductase. It employs one cofactor, FAD.
