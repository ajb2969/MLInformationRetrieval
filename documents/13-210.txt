A good discussion of such points can be found in Grass et al. 2  Definition  Of particular interest here are discounted infinite horizon optimal control problems that are autonomous. 3 These problems can be formulated as       max    u   (  t  )    ∈  Ω      ∫  0  ∞     e   -   ρ  t     φ   (   x   (  t  )    ,   u   (  t  )    )   d  t         subscript       u  t   normal-Ω      superscript   subscript   0        superscript  e      ρ  t     φ     x  t     u  t    d  t      \max_{u(t)\in\Omega}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\rho t}\varphi\left(x(t),u(t)\right)dt     s.t.          x  ˙    (  t  )    =   f   (   x   (  t  )    ,   u   (  t  )    )     ,    x   (  0  )    =   x  0     ,     formulae-sequence       normal-˙  x   t     f     x  t     u  t          x  0    subscript  x  0      \dot{x}(t)=f\left(x(t),u(t)\right),x(0)=x_{0},     where    ρ  >  0      ρ  0    \rho>0   is the discount rate,    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   and    u   (  t  )       u  t    u(t)   are the state and control variables, respectively, at time   t   t   t   , functions   φ   φ   \varphi   and   f   f   f   are assumed to be continuously differentiable with respect to their arguments and they do not depend explicitly on time   t   t   t   , and   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is the set of feasible controls and it also is explicitly independent of time   t   t   t   . Furthermore, it is assumed that the integral converges for any admissible solution    (  x   (  .  )   ,  u   (  .  )   )     fragments  normal-(  x   fragments  normal-(  normal-.  normal-)   normal-,  u   fragments  normal-(  normal-.  normal-)   normal-)    \left(x(.),u(.)\right)   . In such a problem with one-dimensional state variable   x   x   x   , the initial state    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   is called a DNSS point if the system starting from it exhibits multiple optimal solutions or equilibria. Thus, at least in the neighborhood of    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   , the system moves to one equilibrium for    x  >   x  0       x   subscript  x  0     x>x_{0}   and to another for    x  <   x  0       x   subscript  x  0     x   . In this sense,    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   is an indifference point from which the system could move to either of the two equilibria.  For two-dimensional optimal control problems, Grass et al. 4 and Zeiler et al. 5 present examples that exhibit DNSS curves.  Some references on the application of DNSS points are Caulkins et al. 6 and Zeiler et al. 7  History  Suresh P. Sethi identified such indifference points for the first time in 1977. 8 Further, Skiba, 9 Sethi, 10 and Deckert and Nishimura 11 explored these indifference points in economic models. The term DNSS (Deckert, Nishimura, Sethi, Skiba) points, introduced by Grass et al., 12 recognizes (alphabetically) the contributions of these authors.  These indifference points have been referred to earlier as Skiba points or DNS points in the literature. 13  Example  A simple problem exhibiting this behavior is given by      φ   (  x  ,  u  )    =   x  u    ,        φ   x  u      x  u     \varphi\left(x,u\right)=xu,         f   (  x  ,  u  )    =    -  x   +  u    ,        f   x  u        x   u     f\left(x,u\right)=-x+u,   and    Ω  =   [   -  1   ,  1  ]       normal-Ω     1   1     \Omega=\left[-1,1\right]   . It is shown in Grass et al. 14 that     x  0   =  0       subscript  x  0   0    x_{0}=0   is a DNSS point for this problem because the optimal path    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   can be either    (   1  -   e   -  t     )      1   superscript  e    t      \left(1-e^{-t}\right)   or    (    -  1   +   e   -  t     )        1    superscript  e    t      \left(-1+e^{-t}\right)   . Note that for     x  0   <  0       subscript  x  0   0    x_{0}<0   , the optimal path is     x   (  t  )    =    -  1   +   e   -   t   (    x  0   +  1   )             x  t       1    superscript  e      t     subscript  x  0   1         x(t)=-1+e^{-t\left(x_{0}+1\right)}   and for     x  0   >  0       subscript  x  0   0    x_{0}>0   , the optimal path is     x   (  t  )    =   1  +   e   -   t   (    x  0   -  1   )             x  t     1   superscript  e      t     subscript  x  0   1         x(t)=1+e^{-t\left(x_{0}-1\right)}   .
