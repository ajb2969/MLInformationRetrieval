   BTZ black hole      BTZ black hole   The BTZ black hole , named after Máximo Bañados , Claudio Teitelboim , and Jorge Zanelli , is a black hole solution for (2+1)-dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant .  History  In 1992 Bañados, Teitelboim and Zanelli discovered BTZ black hole. At that time, it came as a surprise because it is believed that no black hole solutions are shown to exist for a negative cosmological constant and BTZ black hole has remarkably similar properties to the 3+1 dimensional black hole, which would exist in our real universe.  When the cosmological constant is zero, a vacuum solution of (2+1)-dimensional gravity is necessarily flat, and it can be shown that no black hole solutions with event horizons exist. By introducing dilatons , we can have black holes. We do have conical angle deficit solutions, but they don't have event horizons. It therefore came as a surprise when black hole solutions were shown to exist for a negative cosmological constant.  Properties  The similarities to the ordinary black holes in 3+1　dimensions:   It has "no hairs" ( No hair theorem ) and is fully characterized by ADM-mass , angular momentum and charge.  It has the same thermodynamical properties as the ordinary black holes, e.g. its entropy is captured by a law directly analogous to the Bekenstein bound in (3+1)-dimensions, essentially with the surface area replaced by the BTZ black hole's circumference.  Like the Kerr black hole , a rotating BTZ black hole contains an inner and an outer horizon (see also ergosphere ).   Since (2+1)-dimensional gravity has no Newtonian limit , one might fear that the BTZ black hole is not the final state of a gravitational collapse . It was however shown, that this black hole could arise from collapsing matter and we can calculate the energy-moment tensor of BTZ as same as (3+1) black holes.  section 3 Black Holes and Gravitational Collapse.  The BTZ solution is often discussed in the realm on (2+1)-dimensional quantum gravity .  The case without charge  The metric in the absence of charge is       d   s  2    =    -      (    r  2   -   r  +  2    )    (    r  2   -   r  -  2    )      l  2    r  2     d   t  2     +     l  2    r  2   d   r  2      (    r  2   -   r  +  2    )    (    r  2   -   r  -  2    )     +    r  2     (    d  ϕ   -      r  +    r  -     l   r  2     d  t    )   2           d   superscript  s  2                 superscript  r  2    superscript   subscript  r    2       superscript  r  2    superscript   subscript  r    2        superscript  l  2    superscript  r  2     d   superscript  t  2          superscript  l  2    superscript  r  2   d   superscript  r  2         superscript  r  2    superscript   subscript  r    2       superscript  r  2    superscript   subscript  r    2         superscript  r  2    superscript      d  ϕ          subscript  r     subscript  r       l   superscript  r  2     d  t    2       ds^{2}=-\frac{(r^{2}-r_{+}^{2})(r^{2}-r_{-}^{2})}{l^{2}r^{2}}dt^{2}+\frac{l^{2%

The mass and angular momentum of the black hole is       M  =     r  +  2   +   r  -  2     l  2     ,   J  =    2   r  +    r  -    l       formulae-sequence    M       superscript   subscript  r    2    superscript   subscript  r    2     superscript  l  2       J      2   subscript  r     subscript  r     l      M=\frac{r_{+}^{2}+r_{-}^{2}}{l^{2}},~{}~{}~{}~{}~{}J=\frac{2r_{+}r_{-}}{l}     BTZ black holes without any electric charge are locally isometric to anti-de Sitter space . More precisely, it corresponds to an orbifold of the universal covering space of AdS 3 .  A rotating BTZ black hole admits closed timelike curves .
