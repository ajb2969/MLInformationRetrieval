   Kronecker's theorem      Kronecker's theorem   In mathematics , Kronecker's theorem is a theorem about diophantine approximation, introduced by .  Kronecker's approximation theorem had been firstly proved by L. Kronecker in the end of the 19th century. It has been now revealed to relate to the idea of n-torus and Mahler measure since the later half of the 20th century. In terms of physical systems, it has the consequence that planets in circular orbits moving uniformly around a star will, over time, assume all alignments, unless there is an exact dependency between their orbital periods.  Statement  Kronecker's theorem is a result in diophantine approximations applying to several real numbers ''x i'' , for 1 ≤ i ≤ n , that generalises Dirichlet's approximation theorem to multiple variables.  The classical Kronecker's approximation theorem is formulated as follows; Given real numbers      α  i   =   (   α   i  1    ,  ⋯  ,   α   i  n    )   ∈   ℝ  n    ,   i  =   1  ,  ⋯  ,  m       formulae-sequence       subscript  α  i     subscript  α   subscript  i  1    normal-⋯   subscript  α   subscript  i  n           superscript  ℝ  n       i   1  normal-⋯  m      \alpha_{i}=(\alpha_{i_{1}},\cdots,\alpha_{i_{n}})\in\mathbb{R}^{n},i=1,\cdots,m   and     β  j   =   (   β  1   ,  ⋯  ,   β  n   )   ∈   ℝ  n          subscript  β  j     subscript  β  1   normal-⋯   subscript  β  n          superscript  ℝ  n      \beta_{j}=(\beta_{1},\cdots,\beta_{n})\in\mathbb{R}^{n}   , for any small    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   there exist integers    p  i     subscript  p  i    p_{i}   and    q  j     subscript  q  j    q_{j}   such that        |     ∑   i  =  1   m     q  i    α   i  j      -   p  j   -   β  j    |   <  ϵ   ,   1  ≤  j  ≤  n      formulae-sequence          subscript   superscript   m     i  1       subscript  q  i    subscript  α    i  j       subscript  p  j    subscript  β  j     ϵ       1  j       n      \biggl|\sum^{m}_{i=1}q_{i}\alpha_{ij}-p_{j}-\beta_{j}\biggr|<\epsilon,\ \ \ \ %

Relation to tori  In the case of N numbers, taken as a single N - tuple and point P of the torus   T = R N /Z N ,   the closure of the subgroup  generated by P will be finite, or some torus T′ contained in T . The original Kronecker's theorem ( Leopold Kronecker , 1884) stated that the necessary condition for   T′ = T ,   which is that the numbers ''x i'' together with 1 should be linearly independent over the rational numbers , is also sufficient . Here it is easy to see that if some linear combination of the ''x i'' and 1 with non-zero rational number coefficients is zero, then the coefficients may be taken as integers, and a character χ of the group T other than the trivial character takes the value 1 on P . By Pontryagin duality we have T′ contained in the kernel of χ, and therefore not equal to T .  In fact a thorough use of Pontryagin duality here shows that the whole Kronecker theorem describes the closure of  as the intersection of the kernels of the χ with   χ( P ) = 1.   This gives an ( antitone ) Galois connection between monogenic closed subgroups of T (those with a single generator, in the topological sense), and sets of characters with kernel containing a given point. Not all closed subgroups occur as monogenic; for example a subgroup that has a torus of dimension ≥ 1 as connected component of the identity element, and that is not connected, cannot be such a subgroup.  The theorem leaves open the question of how well (uniformly) the multiples mP of P fill up the closure. In the one-dimensional case, the distribution is uniform by the equidistribution theorem .
