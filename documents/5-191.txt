In mathematics, Cayley's formula is a result in graph theory named after Arthur Cayley. It states that for every positive integer n, the number of trees on n labeled vertices is 
 
 
 
 .
The formula equivalently counts the number of spanning trees of a complete graph with labeled vertices .
Proof
Many remarkable proofs of Cayley's tree formula are known.1 One classical proof of the formula uses Kirchhoff's matrix tree theorem, a formula for the number of spanning trees in an arbitrary graph involving the determinant of a matrix. Prüfer sequences yield a bijective proof of Cayley's formula. Another bijective proof, by André Joyal, finds a one-to-one transformation between n-node trees with two distinguished nodes and maximal directed pseudoforests. A proof by double counting due to Jim Pitman counts in two different ways the number of different sequences of directed edges that can be added to an empty graph on n vertices to form from it a rooted tree; see Double counting (proof technique)#Counting trees.
History
The formula was first discovered by Carl Wilhelm Borchardt in 1860, and proved via a determinant.2 In a short 1889 note, Cayley extended the formula in several directions, by taking into account the degrees of the vertices.3 Although he referred to Borchardt's original paper, the name "Cayley's formula" became standard in the field.
