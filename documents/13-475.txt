   Winter's formula      Winter's formula   "Winters' Formula", 1 named for Dr. R.W. Winters, 2 is a formula used to evaluate respiratory compensation when analyzing acid-base disorders and a metabolic acidosis is present. 3 4 It can be given as       P   C   O  2     =     (    1.5  ×  H   C   O  3  -    )   +  8   ±  2        subscript  P    C   subscript  O  2      plus-or-minus        1.5  H   C   superscript   subscript  O  3      8   2     P_{CO_{2}}=(1.5\times HCO_{3}^{-})+8\pm 2   ,  where HCO3 − is given in units of mEq/L and pCO 2 will be in units of mmHg.  Winters' formula gives an expected value for the patient's P CO2 ; the patient's actual (measured) P CO2 is then compared to this. If the two values correspond, respiratory compensation is considered to be adequate. If the measured P CO2 is higher than the calculated value, there is also a primary respiratory acidosis . If the measured P CO2 is lower than the calculated value, there is also a primary respiratory alkalosis .  Alkalosis  Note that Winter's formula pertains to settings of metabolic acidosis.  To calculate the expected pCO2 in the setting of metabolic alkalosis , the following equations are used:   pCO2 = 0.7 [HCO3] + 20 mmHg +/- 5  pCO2 = 0.7 [HCO3] + 21 mmHg 5   References  "  Category:Respiratory therapy  Category:Mathematics in medicine     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  Hasan, Ashfaq.
