   Carnitinamidase      Carnitinamidase   In enzymology , a carnitinamidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-carnitinamide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-carnitine + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-carnitinamide and H 2 O , whereas its two products are L-carnitine and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-carnitinamide amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include L-carnitinamidase , carnitine amidase , and L-carnitine amidase .
