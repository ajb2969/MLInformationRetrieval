   Triangular function      Triangular function     The triangular function (also known as the triangle function , hat function , or tent function ) is defined either as :       tri   (  t  )    =   and   (  t  )         tri  t     italic- and  t     \displaystyle\operatorname{tri}(t)=\and(t)     or, equivalently, as the convolution of two identical unit rectangular functions :       tri   (  t  )    =    rect   (  t  )    *   rect   (  t  )          tri  t      rect  t    rect  t      \displaystyle\operatorname{tri}(t)=\operatorname{rect}(t)*\operatorname{rect}(t)     The triangular function can also be represented as the product of the rectangular and absolute value functions:       tri   (  t  )    =    rect   (   t  /  2   )     (   1  -   |  t  |    )         tri  t     rect    t  2      1    t       \operatorname{tri}(t)=\operatorname{rect}(t/2)\left(1-\left|t\right|\right)     The function is useful in signal processing and communication systems engineering as a representation of an idealized signal, and as a prototype or kernel from which more realistic signals can be derived. It also has applications in pulse code modulation as a pulse shape for transmitting digital signals and as a matched filter for receiving the signals. It is also equivalent to the triangular window sometimes called the Bartlett window .  Note that in some cases the triangle function may be defined to have a base of length 1 instead of length 2:          tri   (  t  )    =   and   (  t  )          =    def      max   (   1  -   |   2  t   |    ,  0  )            =   {       1  -   |   2  t   |    ,       |   2  t   |   <  1        0  ,     otherwise                tri  t     italic- and  t        def  absent         1      2  t     0       missing-subexpression     absent   cases    1      2  t           2  t    1   0  otherwise       \begin{aligned}\displaystyle\operatorname{tri}(t)=\and(t)&\displaystyle%
