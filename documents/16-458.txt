   Twist (mathematics)      Twist (mathematics)   In mathematics ( differential geometry ) twist is the rate of rotation of a smooth ribbon around the space curve     X  =   X   (  s  )        X    X  s     X=X(s)   , where   s   s   s   is the arc-length of   X   X   X   and    U  =   U   (  s  )        U    U  s     U=U(s)   a unit vector perpendicular at each point to   X   X   X   . Since the ribbon    (  X  ,  U  )     X  U    (X,U)   has edges   X   X   X   and     X  ′   =   X  +   ε  U         superscript  X  normal-′     X    ε  U      X^{\prime}=X+\varepsilon U   the twist (or total twist number )    T  w      T  w    Tw   measures the average winding of the curve    X  ′     superscript  X  normal-′    X^{\prime}   around and along the curve   X   X   X   . According to Love (1944) twist is defined by        T  w   =    1   2  π     ∫     (     d  U    d  s    ×  U   )   ⋅    d  X    d  s     d   s       ,        T  w       1    2  π         normal-⋅        d  U     d  s    U       d  X     d  s     d  s       Tw=\dfrac{1}{2\pi}\int\left(\dfrac{dU}{ds}\times U\right)\cdot\dfrac{dX}{ds}ds\;,     where      d  X   /  d   s          d  X   d   s    dX/ds   is the unit tangent vector to   X   X   X   . The total twist number    T  w      T  w    Tw   can be decomposed (Moffatt & Ricca 1992) into normalized total torsion    T   T   T   and intrinsic twist    N   N   N   , that is        T  w   =     1   2  π     ∫    τ   d  s     +     [  Θ  ]   X    2  π     =   T  +   N     ,          T  w         1    2  π        τ  d  s        subscript   delimited-[]  normal-Θ   X     2  π            T  N      Tw=\dfrac{1}{2\pi}\int\tau\;ds+\dfrac{\left[\Theta\right]_{X}}{2\pi}=T+N\;,     where    τ  =   τ   (  s  )        τ    τ  s     \tau=\tau(s)   is the torsion of the space curve   X   X   X   , and     [  Θ  ]   X     subscript   delimited-[]  normal-Θ   X    \left[\Theta\right]_{X}   denotes the total rotation angle of   U   U   U   along   X   X   X   . The total twist number    T  w      T  w    Tw   depends on the choice of the vector field   U   U   U   (Banchoff & White 1975).  When the ribbon is deformed so as to pass through an inflectional state (i.e.   X   X   X   has a point of inflection ) torsion becomes singular, but its singularity is integrable (Moffatt & Ricca 1992) and    T  w      T  w    Tw   remains continuous. This behavior has many important consequences for energy considerations in many fields of science.  Together with the writhe     W  r      W  r    Wr   of   X   X   X   , twist is a geometric quantity that plays an important role in the application of the Călugăreanu–White–Fuller formula     L  k   =    W  r   +   T  w          L  k       W  r     T  w      Lk=Wr+Tw   in topological fluid dynamics (for its close relation to kinetic and magnetic helicity of a vector field), physical knot theory , and structural complexity analysis.
