   Tangent half-angle substitution      Tangent half-angle substitution   In integral calculus , the tangent half-angle substitution is a substitution used for finding antiderivatives , and hence definite integrals, of rational functions of trigonometric functions . No generality is lost by taking these to be rational functions of the sine and cosine. Michael Spivak wrote that "The world's sneakiest substitution is undoubtedly" this technique. 1  Euler and Weierstrass  Various books call this the Weierstrass substitution , after Karl Weierstrass (1815 – 1897), without citing any occurrence of the substitution in Weierstrass' writings, 2 3 4 but the technique appears well before Weierstrass was born, in the work of Leonhard Euler (1707 – 1783). 5  The substitution  One starts with the problem of finding an antiderivative of a rational function of the sine and cosine; and replaces sin x , cos x , and the differential d x with rational functions of a variable t and the product of a rational function of t with the differential d t , as follows: 6      sin  x      x    \displaystyle\sin x     Derivation  Let       t  =   tan   x  2     .      t      x  2      t=\tan\frac{x}{2}.     By the double-angle formula for the sine function,      sin  x      x    \displaystyle\sin x     By the double-angle formula for the cosine function,      cos  x      x    \displaystyle\cos x     The differential d x can be calculated as follows:        d  t    d  x          normal-d  t     normal-d  x     \displaystyle\frac{\mathrm{d}t}{\mathrm{d}x}     Examples  (Figure)  The tangent half-angle formula relates an angle to the slope of a line.   First example       ∫   csc    x   d  x             x  normal-d  x      \displaystyle\int\csc x\,\mathrm{d}x     Second example: a definite integral        ∫  0   2  π        d  x    2  +   cos  x          superscript   subscript   0     2  π        normal-d  x     2    x       \displaystyle\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{2+\cos x}   In the first line, one does not simply substitute    t  =  0      t  0    t=0   for both limits of integration . The singularity (in this case, a vertical asymptote ) of    t  =   tan   x  2        t      x  2      t=\tan\frac{x}{2}   at    x  =  π      x  π    x=\pi   must be taken into account.  Geometry  (Figure)  The Weierstrass substitution parametrizes the unit circle centered at (0, 0). Instead of +∞ and −∞, we have only one ∞, at both ends of the real line. That is often appropriate when dealing with rational functions and with trigonometric functions. (This is the one-point compactification of the line.)   As x varies, the point (cos x , sin x ) winds repeatedly around the unit circle centered at (0, 0). The point      (    1  -   t  2     1  +   t  2     ,    2  t    1  +   t  2     )         1   superscript  t  2      1   superscript  t  2         2  t     1   superscript  t  2       \left(\frac{1-t^{2}}{1+t^{2}},\frac{2t}{1+t^{2}}\right)     goes only once around the circle as t goes from −∞ to +∞, and never reaches the point (−1, 0), which is approached as a limit as t approaches ±∞. As t goes from −∞ to −1, the point determined by t goes through the part of the circle in the third quadrant, from (−1, 0) to (0, −1). As t goes from −1 to 0, the point follows the part of the circle in the fourth quadrant from (0, −1) to (1, 0). As t goes from 0 to 1, the point follows the part of the circle in the first quadrant from (1, 0) to (0, 1). Finally, as t goes from 1 to +∞, the point follows the part of the circle in the second quadrant from (0, 1) to (−1, 0).  Here is another geometric point of view. Draw the unit circle, and let P be the point . A line through P (except the vertical line) is determined by its slope. Furthermore, each of the lines (except the vertical line) intersects the unit circle in exactly two points, one of which is P . This determines a function from points on the unit circle to slopes. The trigonometric functions determine a function from angles to points on the unit circle, and by combining these two functions we have a function from angles to slopes.  Hyperbolic functions  As with other properties shared between the two functions, it is also possible to construct a similar form:        sinh  x   =    2  t    1  -   t  2      ,        x       2  t     1   superscript  t  2       \sinh x=\frac{2t}{1-t^{2}},           cosh  x   =    1  +   t  2     1  -   t  2      ,        x       1   superscript  t  2      1   superscript  t  2       \cosh x=\frac{1+t^{2}}{1-t^{2}},           tanh  x   =    2  t    1  +   t  2      ,        x       2  t     1   superscript  t  2       \tanh x=\frac{2t}{1+t^{2}},           d  x   =    2   1  -   t  2     d  t    .        d  x       2    1   superscript  t  2     d  t     dx=\frac{2}{1-t^{2}}dt.
