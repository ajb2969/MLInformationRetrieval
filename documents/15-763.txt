   Similarity learning      Similarity learning   Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning in artificial intelligence . It is closely related to regression and classification , but the goal is to learn from examples a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking , in recommendation systems and face verification.  Learning setup  There are three common setups for similarity and metric distance learning.   Regression similarity learning . In this setup, pairs of objects are given $(x_i^1, x_i^2)$ together with a measure of their similarity $y_i \in R$ . The goal is to learn a function that approximates $f(x_i^1, x_i^2) \sim y_i$ for every new labeled triplet example $(x_i^1, x_i^2, y_i)$ . This is typically achieved by minimizing a regularized loss $min_W \sum_i loss(w;x_i^1, x_i^2,y_i) + reg(w)$ .  Classification similarity learning . Given are pairs of similar objects $(x_i, x_i^+)$ and non similar objects $(x_i, x_i^-)$ . An equivalent formulation is that every pair $(x_i^1, x_i^2)$ is given together with a binary label $y_i \in \{0,1\}$ that determines if the two objects are similar or not. The goal is again to learn a classifier that can decide if a new pair of objects is similar or not.  Ranking similarity learning . Given are triplets of objects $(x_i, x_i^+, x_i^-)$ whose relative similarity obey a predefined order $$x_i$$ is known to be more similar to $x_i^+$ than to $x_i^-$ . The goal is to learn a function $f$ such that for any new triplet of objects $(x, x^+, x^-)$ , it obeys $f(x, x^+) > f(x, x^-)$ . This setup assumes a weaker form of supervision than in regression, because instead of providing an exact measure of similarity, one only has to provide the relative order of similarity. For this reason, ranking-based similarity learning is easier to apply in real large scale applications. 1   A common approach for learning similarity, is to model the similarity function as a bilinear form . For example, in the case of ranking similarity learning, one aims to learn a matrix W that parametrizes the similarity function $f_W(x, z)  = x^T W z$ .  Metric learning  Similarity learning is closely related to distance metric learning . Metric learning is the task of learning a distance function over objects. A metric or distance function has to obey four axioms: non-negativity , Identity of indiscernibles , symmetry and subadditivity / triangle inequality. In practice, metric learning algorithms ignore the condition of identity of indiscernibles and learn a pseudo-metric.  When the objects $x_i$ are vectors in $R^d$ , then any matrix $W$ in the symmetric positive semi-definite cone $S_+^d$ defines a distance pseudo-metric of the space of x through the form $D_W(x_1, x_2)^2 = (x_1-x_2)^{\top} W (x_1-x_2)$ . When $W$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix, $D_W$ is a metric. Moreover, as any symmetric positive semi-definite matrix $W \in S_+^d$ can be decomposed as $W = L^{\top}L$ where $L \in R^{e \times d}$ and $e \geq rank(W)$ , the distance function $D_W$ can be rewritten equivalently $D_W(x_1, x_2)^2 = (x_1-x_2)^{\top} L^{\top}L (x_1-x_2) = \| L (x_1-x_2) \|_2^2$ . The distance $D_W(x_1, x_2)^2=\| x_1' - x_2' \|_2^2$ corresponds to the Euclidean distance between the projected feature vectors $x_1'= Lx_1$ and $x_2'= Lx_2$ . Some well-known approaches for metric learning include Large margin nearest neighbor  2 , Information theoretic metric learning (ITML). 3  In statistics , the covariance matrix of the data is sometimes used to define a distance metric called Mahalanobis distance .  Applications  Similarity learning is used in information retrieval for learning to rank, in face verification or face identification, 4 5 and in recommendation systems . Also, many machine learning approaches rely on some metric. This includes unsupervised learning such as clustering , which groups together close or similar objects. It also includes supervised approaches like K-nearest neighbor algorithm which rely on labels of nearby objects to decide on the label of a new object. Metric learning has been proposed as a preprocessing step for many of these approaches . 6  Further reading  For further information on this topic, see the survey on metric and similarity learning by Kulis. 7  References  "  Category:Machine learning     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
