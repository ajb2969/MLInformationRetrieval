Čech-to-derived functor spectral sequence

In algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics, the Čech-to-derived functor spectral sequence is a spectral sequence that relates Čech cohomology of a sheaf and sheaf cohomology.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a sheaf on a topological space X. Choose an open cover 
 
 
 
  of X. That is, 
 
 
 
  is a set of open subsets of X which together cover X. Let 
 
 
 
  denote the presheaf which takes an open set U to the qth cohomology of 
 
 
 
  on U, that is, to 
 
 
 
 . For any presheaf 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  denote the pth Čech cohomology of 
 
 
 
  with respect to the cover 
 
 
 
 . Then the Čech-to-derived functor spectral sequence is:



Properties
If 
 
 
 
  consists of only two open sets, then this spectral sequence degenerates to the Mayer–Vietoris sequence. See Spectral sequence#Long exact sequences.
If for all finite intersections of a covering the cohomology vanishes, the E2-term degenerates and the edge morphisms yield an isomorphism of Čech cohomology for this covering to sheaf cohomology. This provides a method of computing sheaf cohomology using Čech cohomology. For instance, this happens if 
 
 
 
  is a quasi-coherent sheaf on a scheme and each element of 
 
 
 
  is an open affine subscheme such that all finite intersections are again affine (e.g. if the scheme is separated). This can be used to compute the cohomology of line bundles on projective space.
