(S)-coclaurine-N-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a (S)-coclaurine-N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + (S)-coclaurine 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + (S)-N-methylcoclaurine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and (S)-coclaurine, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and (S)-N-methylcoclaurine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:(S)-coclaurine-N-methyltransferase. This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis i.
