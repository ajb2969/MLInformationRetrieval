UDP-sugar diphosphatase




UDP-sugar diphosphatase

In enzymology, an UDP-sugar diphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-sugar + H2O 
 
 
 
  UMP + alpha-D-aldose 1-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-sugar and H2O, whereas its two products are UMP and alpha-D-aldose 1-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-sugar sugarphosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include nucleosidediphosphate-sugar pyrophosphatase, nucleosidediphosphate-sugar diphosphatase, UDP-sugar hydrolase, and UDP-sugar pyrophosphatase.
