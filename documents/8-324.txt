   Pair distribution function      Pair distribution function   The pair distribution function (PDF) describes the distribution of distances between pairs of particles contained within a given volume. Mathematically, if a and b are two particles in a fluid, the PDF of b with respect to a , denoted by     g   a  b     (   r  ‚Üí   )        subscript  g    a  b     normal-‚Üí  r     g_{ab}(\vec{r})   is the probability of finding the particle b at the distance    r  ‚Üí     normal-‚Üí  r    \vec{r}   from a , with a taken as the origin of coordinates.  Overview  The pair distribution function is used to describe the distribution of objects within a medium (for example, oranges in a crate or nitrogen molecules in a gas cylinder). If the medium is homogeneous (i.e. every spatial location has identical properties), then there is an equal probability density for finding an object at any position    r  ‚Üí     normal-‚Üí  r    \vec{r}   :       p   (   r  ‚Üí   )    =   1  /  V         p   normal-‚Üí  r      1  V     p(\vec{r})=1/V   , where   V   V   V   is the volume of the container. On the other hand, the likelihood of finding pairs of objects at given positions (i.e. the two-body probability density) is not uniform. For example, pairs of hard balls must be separated by at least the diameter of a ball. The pair distribution function    g   (   r  ‚Üí   ,    r  ‚Ä≤   ‚Üí   )       g    normal-‚Üí  r    normal-‚Üí   superscript  r  normal-‚Ä≤       g(\vec{r},\vec{r^{\prime}})   is obtained by scaling the two-body probability density function by the total number of objects   N   N   N   and the size of the container:       g   (   r  ‚Üí   ,    r  ‚Üí   ‚Ä≤   )    =   p   (   r  ‚Üí   ,    r  ‚Üí   ‚Ä≤   )    V  2     N  -  1   N          g    normal-‚Üí  r    superscript   normal-‚Üí  r   normal-‚Ä≤       p    normal-‚Üí  r    superscript   normal-‚Üí  r   normal-‚Ä≤     superscript  V  2       N  1   N      g(\vec{r},\vec{r}^{\prime})=p(\vec{r},\vec{r}^{\prime})V^{2}\frac{N-1}{N}   . In the common case where the number of objects in the container is large, this simplifies to give:       g   (   r  ‚Üí   ,    r  ‚Üí   ‚Ä≤   )    ‚âà   p   (   r  ‚Üí   ,    r  ‚Üí   ‚Ä≤   )    V  2          g    normal-‚Üí  r    superscript   normal-‚Üí  r   normal-‚Ä≤       p    normal-‚Üí  r    superscript   normal-‚Üí  r   normal-‚Ä≤     superscript  V  2      g(\vec{r},\vec{r}^{\prime})\approx p(\vec{r},\vec{r}^{\prime})V^{2}   .  Simple models and general properties  The simplest possible pair distribution function assumes that all object locations are mutually independent, giving:       g   (   r  ‚Üí   )    =  1        g   normal-‚Üí  r    1    g(\vec{r})=1   , where    r  ‚Üí     normal-‚Üí  r    \vec{r}   is the separation between a pair of objects. However, this is inaccurate in the case of hard objects as discussed above, because it does not account for the minimum separation required between objects. The hole-correction (HC) approximation provides a better model:      r  =   n  b       r    n  b     r=nb   is the diameter of one of the objects.  Although the HC approximation gives a reasonable description of sparsely packed objects, it breaks down for dense packing. This may be illustrated by considering a box completely filled by identical hard balls so that each ball touches its neighbours. In this case, every pair of balls in the box is separated by a distance of exactly   n   n   n   where     g   (  r  )    =    ‚àë  i    Œ¥   (   r  -   i  b    )           g  r     subscript   i     Œ¥    r    i  b        g(r)=\sum\limits_{i}\delta(r-ib)   is a positive whole number. The pair distribution for a volume completely filled by hard spheres is therefore a set of Dirac delta functions of the form:        lim   r  ‚Üí  ‚àû     g   (  r  )     =  1        subscript    normal-‚Üí  r       g  r    1    \lim\limits_{r\to\infty}g(r)=1   .  Finally, it may be noted that a pair of objects which are separated by a large distance have no influence on each other's position (provided that the container is not completely filled). Therefore,     f   f   f   .  In general, a pair distribution function will take a form somewhere between the sparsely packed (HC approximation) and the densely packed (delta function) models, depending on the packing density      g   a  b     (  r  )    =    1    N  a    N  b       ‚àë   i  =  1    N  a      ‚àë   j  =  1    N  b     ‚ü®   Œ¥   (    |   ùê´   i  j    |   -  r   )    ‚ü©             subscript  g    a  b    r       1     subscript  N  a    subscript  N  b       superscript   subscript     i  1     subscript  N  a      superscript   subscript     j  1     subscript  N  b     delimited-‚ü®‚ü©    Œ¥       subscript  ùê´    i  j     r          g_{ab}(r)=\frac{1}{N_{a}N_{b}}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_{a}}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N_{b%
 }}\langle\delta(|\mathbf{r}_{ij}|-r)\rangle   .  Radial pair distributions  Of special practical importance is the radial pair distribution function, which is independent of orientation. It is a major descriptor for the atomic structure of amorphous materials (glasses, polymers) and liquids. The radial PDF can be calculated directly from physical measurements like light scattering or x-ray powder diffraction through the use of Fourier Transform .  In Statistical Mechanics the PDF is given by the expression:  $g_{ab}(r) = \frac{1}{N_{a} N_b}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_a} \sum\limits_{j=1}^{N_b} \langle \delta( \vert \mathbf{r}_{ij} \vert -r)\rangle$  The Diffpy project is used to match crystal structures with PDF data derived from X-ray or neutron diffraction data.
