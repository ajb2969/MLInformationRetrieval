   Skew-Hermitian      Skew-Hermitian   An   n   n   n   by   n   n   n   complex or real matrix    A  =    (   a   i  ,  j    )     1  ≤  i   ,   j  ≤  n         A   subscript   subscript  a   i  j     formulae-sequence    1  i     j  n       A=(a_{i,j})_{1\leq i,j\leq n}   is said to be anti-Hermitian , skew-Hermitian , or said to represent a skew-adjoint  operator , or to be a skew-adjoint matrix , on the complex or real   n   n   n   dimensional space    K  n     superscript  K  n    K^{n}   , if its adjoint is the negative of itself:     A  *   =   -  A        superscript  A      A     A^{*}=-A   .  Note that the adjoint of an operator depends on the scalar product considered on the   n   n   n   dimensional complex or real space    K  n     superscript  K  n    K^{n}   . If    (  ⋅  |  ⋅  )     fragments  normal-(  normal-⋅  normal-|  normal-⋅  normal-)    (\cdot|\cdot)   denotes the scalar product on    K  n     superscript  K  n    K^{n}   , then saying   A   A   A   is skew-adjoint means that for all     u  ,  v   ∈   K  n        u  v    superscript  K  n     u,v\in K^{n}   one has     (  A  u  |  v  )   =  -   (  u  |  A  v  )   .     fragments   fragments  normal-(  A  u  normal-|  v  normal-)      fragments  normal-(  u  normal-|  A  v  normal-)   normal-.    (Au|v)=-(u|Av)\,.     In the particular case of the canonical scalar products on    K  n     superscript  K  n    K^{n}   , the matrix of a skew-adjoint operator satisfies     a   i  j    =   -    a  ¯    j  i          subscript  a    i  j       subscript   normal-¯  a     j  i       a_{ij}=-{\overline{a}}_{ji}   for all     1  ≤  i   ,   j  ≤  n      formulae-sequence    1  i     j  n     1\leq i,j\leq n   .  Imaginary numbers can be thought of as skew-adjoint (since they are like 1-by-1 matrices), whereas real numbers correspond to self-adjoint operators.
