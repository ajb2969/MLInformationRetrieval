Skew-Hermitian

An 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  complex or real matrix 
 
 
 
  is said to be anti-Hermitian, skew-Hermitian, or said to represent a skew-adjoint operator, or to be a skew-adjoint matrix, on the complex or real 
 
 
 
  dimensional space 
 
 
 
 , if its adjoint is the negative of itself: 
 
 
 
 .
Note that the adjoint of an operator depends on the scalar product considered on the 
 
 
 
  dimensional complex or real space 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  denotes the scalar product on 
 
 
 
 , then saying 
 
 
 
  is skew-adjoint means that for all 
 
 
 
  one has 
 
 

In the particular case of the canonical scalar products on 
 
 
 
 , the matrix of a skew-adjoint operator satisfies 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
Imaginary numbers can be thought of as skew-adjoint (since they are like 1-by-1 matrices), whereas real numbers correspond to self-adjoint operators.
