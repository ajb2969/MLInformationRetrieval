Cholesterol-5,6-oxide hydrolase

Cholesterol-5,6-oxide hydrolase (, cholesterol-epoxide hydrolase, ChEH) is an enzyme with system name 5,6alpha-epoxy-5alpha-cholestan-3beta-ol hydrolase.12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) 5,6alpha-epoxy-5alpha-cholestan-3beta-ol + H2O 
 
 
 
  5alpha-cholestane-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol
 
(2) 5,6beta-epoxy-5beta-cholestan-3beta-ol + H2O 
 
 
 
  5alpha-cholestane-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol
 

The enzyme works equally well with either epoxide as substrate.
