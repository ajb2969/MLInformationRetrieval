Beta-mannosylphosphodecaprenol—mannooligosaccharide 6-mannosyltransferase

Beta-mannosylphosphodecaprenol---mannooligosaccharide 6-mannosyltransferase (, mannosylphospholipid-methylmannoside alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase, beta-D-mannosylphosphodecaprenol:1,6-alpha-D-mannosyloligosaccharide 1,6-alpha-D-mannosyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name beta-D-mannosylphosphodecaprenol:(1->6)-alpha-D-mannosyloligosaccharide 6-alpha-D-mannosyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

beta-D-mannosylphosphodecaprenol + (1->6)-alpha-D-mannosyloligosaccharide 
 
 
decaprenol phosphate + (1->6)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->6)-alpha-D-mannosyl-oligosaccharide
 

This enzyme is involved in the formation of mannooligosaccharides in the membrane of Mycobacterium smegmatis.
