Jantzen filtration

In algebra, a Jantzen filtration is a filtration of a Verma module of a semisimple Lie algebra, or a Weyl module of a reductive algebraic group of positive characteristic. Jantzen filtrations were introduced by .
Jantzen filtration for Verma modules
If M(λ) is a Verma module of a semisimple Lie algebra with highest weight λ, then the Janzen filtration is a decreasing filtration


 
  It has the following properties:

M(λ)1 is the maximal proper submodule of M(λ)
The quotients M(λ)k/M(λ)k+1 have non-degenerate contravariant bilinear forms.
