   Nuclear density      Nuclear density   Nuclear density is the density of the nucleus of an atom , averaging about 2.3×10 17 kg/m 3 . The descriptive term nuclear density is also applied to situations where similarly high densities occur, such as within neutron stars .  The nuclear density for a typical nucleus can be approximately calculated from the size of the nucleus , which itself can be approximated based on the number of protons and neutrons in it. The radius of a typical nucleus, in terms of number of nucleons , is    R  =    A   1  /  3     R  0        R     superscript  A    1  3     subscript  R  0      R=A^{1/3}R_{0}   where   A   A   A   is the mass number and    r  0     subscript  r  0    r_{0}   is 1.25 fm , with deviations of 0.2 fm from this value. The density of the nucleus is thus:      n  =   A    4  3   π   R  3         n    A      4  3   π   superscript  R  3       n=\frac{A}{{4\over 3}\pi R^{3}}   The mass density is the product of n by the nuclear mass.  For a single nucleon , A=1, therefore      n  =   3   4  π   R  0    3     =    0.122    fm   -  3     =    1.22  ⋅    10  44      m   -  3           n    3    4  π   superscript   subscript  R  0   3            0.122   superscript  fm    3             normal-⋅  1.22   superscript  10  44     superscript  normal-m    3        n={3\over 4\pi{R_{0}}^{3}}=0.122\ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}=1.22\cdot 10^{44}\ \mathrm{%
 m}^{-3}   The experimentally determined value for n is 0.16 fm −3 . The calculated mass density, using a nucleon mass of 1.67×10 −27 kg, is thus:        (    1.67  ⋅    10   -  27      kg   )    (    1.22  ⋅    10  44      m   -  3     )    =     2.04  ⋅    10  17     kg   ⋅   m   -  3              normal-⋅  1.67   superscript  10    27     kg      normal-⋅  1.22   superscript  10  44     superscript  normal-m    3       normal-⋅     normal-⋅  2.04   superscript  10  17    kg    superscript  normal-m    3       (1.67\cdot 10^{-27}\ \mathrm{kg})(1.22\cdot 10^{44}\ \mathrm{m}^{-3})=2.04%
 \cdot 10^{17}\ \mathrm{kg}\cdot\mathrm{m}^{-3}     Applications and extensions  The components of an atom and of an atomic nucleus have varying densities. The proton is not a fundamental particle, being composed of quark-gluon matter . Its size is approximately 10 −15 meters and its density 10 18 kg/m 3 . The descriptive term nuclear density is also applied to situations where similarly high densities occur, such as within neutron stars .  Using deep inelastic scattering , it has been estimated that the "size" of an electron , if it is not a point particle, must be less than 10 −17 meters. This would correspond to a density of roughly 10 21 kg/m 3 .  Probing deeper within particles, one finds quarks which appear to be very dense and very hard. There are possibilities for still higher densities when it comes to quark matter , gluon matter , or neutrino matter . In the immediate future, the highest experimentally measurable densities will likely be limited to leptons and quarks .
