   Harmonic progression (mathematics)      Harmonic progression (mathematics)   In mathematics , a harmonic progression (or harmonic sequence ) is a progression formed by taking the reciprocals of an arithmetic progression . In other words, it is a sequence of the form        1  /  a   ,    1   a  +  d     ,    1   a  +   2  d      ,    1   a  +   3  d      ,  ⋯  ,   1   a  +   k  d      ,       1  a     1    a  d      1    a    2  d       1    a    3  d     normal-⋯    1    a    k  d       1/a,\ \frac{1}{a+d}\ ,\frac{1}{a+2d}\ ,\frac{1}{a+3d}\ ,\cdots,\frac{1}{a+kd},     where −a/ d is not a natural number and k  is a natural number.  (Terms in the form    x   y  +  z       x    y  z     \frac{x}{y+z}   can be expressed as     x  y     y  +  z   y         x  y       y  z   y     \frac{\frac{x}{y}}{\frac{y+z}{y}}   , we can let     x  y   =  a        x  y   a    \frac{x}{y}=a   and     z  y   =   k  d         z  y     k  d     \frac{z}{y}=kd   .)  Equivalently, a sequence is a harmonic progression when each term is the harmonic mean of the neighboring terms.  It is not possible for a harmonic progression (other than the trivial case where a = 1 and k = 0) to sum to an integer . The reason is that, necessarily, at least one denominator of the progression will be divisible by a prime number that does not divide any other denominator. 1  Examples   12, 6, 4, 3,    12  5      12  5    \tfrac{12}{5}   , 2, … ,    12   1  +  n       12    1  n     \tfrac{12}{1+n}       10, 30, −30, −10, −6, −    30  7      30  7    \tfrac{30}{7}   , … ,    10   1  -     2  n   3         10    1      2  n   3      \tfrac{10}{1-\tfrac{2n}{3}}      Use in geometry  If collinear points A, B, C, and D are such that D is the harmonic conjugate of C with respect to A and B, then the distances from any one of these points to the three remaining points form harmonic progression. 2 3 Specifically, each of the sequences AC, AB, AD; BC, BA, BD; CA, CD, CB; and DA, DC, DB are harmonic progressions, where each of the distances is signed according to a fixed orientation of the line.
