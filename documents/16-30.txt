Epi-isozizaene synthase

Epi-isozizaene synthase (, SCO5222 protein) is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase ((+)-epi-isozizaene-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (+)-epi-isozizaene + diphosphate


This enzyme requires Mg2+ for activity.
