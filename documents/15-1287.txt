   TRNA (cytidine34-2'-O)-methyltransferase      TRNA (cytidine34-2'-O)-methyltransferase   tRNA (cytidine 34 -2'-O)-methyltransferase (, yibK (gene) , methyltransferase yibK , TrmL , tRNA methyltransferase L , tRNA (cytidine 34/5 -carboxymethylaminomethyluridine 34 -2'-O)-methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (cytidine 34/5 -carboxymethylaminomethyluridine 34 -2'-O)-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytidine 34 in tRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylcytidine 34 in tRNA  (2) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluridine 34 in tRNALeu   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2'-O-methyluridine 34 in tRNALeu   The enzyme from Escherichia coli catalyses the 2'-O-methylation of cytidine or 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluridine at the wobble position at nucleotide 34 in tRNALeuCmAA and tRNALeucmnm5UmAA.
