TRNA (cytidine34-2'-O)-methyltransferase

tRNA (cytidine34-2'-O)-methyltransferase (, yibK (gene), methyltransferase yibK, TrmL, tRNA methyltransferase L, tRNA (cytidine34/5-carboxymethylaminomethyluridine34-2'-O)-methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (cytidine34/5-carboxymethylaminomethyluridine34-2'-O)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytidine34 in tRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylcytidine34 in tRNA
 
(2) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluridine34 in tRNALeu 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2'-O-methyluridine34 in tRNALeu
 

The enzyme from Escherichia coli catalyses the 2'-O-methylation of cytidine or 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluridine at the wobble position at nucleotide 34 in tRNALeuCmAA and tRNALeucmnm5UmAA.
