   Plummer model      Plummer model   The Plummer model or Plummer sphere is a density law that was first used by H. C. Plummer to fit observations of globular clusters . 1 It is now often used as toy model in N-body simulations of stellar systems.  Description of the model  (Figure)  The density law of a Plummer model   The Plummer 3-dimensional density profile is given by         ρ  P    (  r  )    =    (    3  M    4  π   a  3     )      (   1  +    r  2    a  2     )    -   5  2        ,         subscript  ρ  P   r         3  M     4  π   superscript  a  3      superscript    1     superscript  r  2    superscript  a  2         5  2        \rho_{P}(r)=\bigg(\frac{3M}{4\pi a^{3}}\bigg)\bigg(1+\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}}\bigg)%
 ^{-\frac{5}{2}}\,,     where M is the total mass of the cluster, and a is the Plummer radius , a scale parameter which sets the size of the cluster core. The corresponding potential is         Φ  P    (  r  )    =   -     G  M      r  2   +   a  2         ,         subscript  normal-Φ  P   r         G  M        superscript  r  2    superscript  a  2         \Phi_{P}(r)=-\frac{GM}{\sqrt{r^{2}+a^{2}}}\,,     where G is Newton 's gravitational constant .  Properties  The mass enclosed within radius   r   r   r   is given by       r  c   =   a     2   -  1     ≈   0.64  a          subscript  r  c     a        2   1            0.64  a      r_{c}=a\sqrt{\sqrt{2}-1}\approx 0.64a   , where the surface density drops to half its central value, is at     r  h   ≈   1.3  a        subscript  r  h     1.3  a     r_{h}\approx 1.3a   .  Half-mass radius is     r  V   =    16   3  π    a   ≈   1.7  a          subscript  r  V       16    3  π    a          1.7  a      r_{V}=\frac{16}{3\pi}a\approx 1.7a     Virial radius is    ρ  →   r   -  5       normal-→  ρ   superscript  r    5      \rho\rightarrow r^{-5}     See also The Art of Computational Science 2  Applications  The Plummer model comes closest to representing the observed density profiles of star clusters , although the rapid falloff of the density at large radii ( $\rho\rightarrow r^{-5}$ ) is not a good description of these systems.  The behavior of the density near the center does not match observations of elliptical galaxies, which typically exhibit a diverging central density.  The ease with which the Plummer sphere can be realized as a Monte-Carlo model has made it a favorite choice of N-body experimenters , in spite of the model's lack of realism. 3  References  "  Category:Astrophysics     Plummer, H.
