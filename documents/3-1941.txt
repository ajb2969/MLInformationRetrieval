Plummer model

The Plummer model or Plummer sphere is a density law that was first used by H. C. Plummer to fit observations of globular clusters.1 It is now often used as toy model in N-body simulations of stellar systems.
Description of the model

The density law of a Plummer model

The Plummer 3-dimensional density profile is given by



where M is the total mass of the cluster, and a is the Plummer radius, a scale parameter which sets the size of the cluster core. The corresponding potential is



where G is Newton's gravitational constant.

Applications
The Plummer model comes closest to representing the observed density profiles of star clusters, although the rapid falloff of the density at large radii ($\rho\rightarrow r^{-5}$) is not a good description of these systems.
The behavior of the density near the center does not match observations of elliptical galaxies, which typically exhibit a diverging central density.
The ease with which the Plummer sphere can be realized as a Monte-Carlo model has made it a favorite choice of N-body experimenters, in spite of the model's lack of realism.3
