   Silver ratio      Silver ratio            Binary     Decimal     Hexadecimal     Continued fraction     Algebraic form     (Figure)  Silver ratio within the octagon   In mathematics , two quantities are in the silver ratio (also silver mean or silver constant ) if the ratio of the sum of the smaller and twice the larger of those quantities, to the larger quantity, is the same as the ratio of the larger one to the smaller one (see below). This defines the silver ratio as an irrational  mathematical constant , whose value of one plus the square root of 2 is approximately 2.4142135623. Its name is an allusion to the golden ratio ; analogously to the way the golden ratio is the limiting ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers , the silver ratio is the limiting ratio of consecutive Pell numbers . The silver ratio is denoted by δ S .  Mathematicians have studied the silver ratio since the time of the Greeks (although perhaps without giving a special name until recently) because of its connections to the square root of 2, its covergents, square triangular numbers , Pell numbers, octagons and the like.  The relation described above can be expressed algebraically:          2  a   +  b   a   =   a  b   ≡    δ  S     .              2  a   b   a     a  b         subscript  δ  S      \frac{2a+b}{a}=\frac{a}{b}\equiv\delta_{S}\,.     The silver ratio can also be defined by the simple continued fraction [2; 2, 2, 2, ...]:        δ  S   =   2  +    1   2  +    1   2  +    1   2  +  ⋱             .       subscript  δ  S     2   continued-fraction  1    2   continued-fraction  1    2   continued-fraction  1    2  normal-⋱           \delta_{S}=2+\cfrac{1}{2+\cfrac{1}{2+\cfrac{1}{2+\ddots}}}\,.     The convergents of this continued fraction (2/1, 5/2, 12/5, 29/12, 70/29, ...) are ratios of consecutive Pell numbers. These fractions provide accurate rational approximations of the silver ratio, analogous to the approximation of the golden ratio by ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers.  Properties    Number-theoretic properties  The silver ratio is a Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number (PV number), as its conjugate  ≈ −0.41}} has absolute value less than 1. In fact it is the second smallest quadratic PV number after the golden ratio. This means the distance from δ to the nearest integer is . Thus, the sequence of fractional parts of δ,  (taken as elements of the torus) converges. In particular, this sequence is not equidistributed mod 1 .  Powers  The lower powers of the silver ratio are       δ  S   -  1    =    1   δ  S    -  2   =   [  0  ;  2  ,  2  ,  2  ,  2  ,  2  ,  …  ]   ≈  0.41421         superscript   subscript  δ  S     1        1   subscript  δ  S    2         0  2  2  2  2  2  normal-…        0.41421     \delta_{S}^{-1}=1\delta_{S}-2=[0;2,2,2,2,2,\dots]\approx 0.41421           δ  S  0    =    0   δ  S    +  1   =   [  1  ]   =  1         superscript   subscript  δ  S   0       0   subscript  δ  S    1         delimited-[]  1        1     \delta_{S}^{0}\!\ \!\ =0\delta_{S}+1=[1]=1           δ  S  1    =    1   δ  S    +  0   =   [  2  ;  2  ,  2  ,  2  ,  2  ,  2  ,  …  ]   ≈  2.41421         superscript   subscript  δ  S   1       1   subscript  δ  S    0         2  2  2  2  2  2  normal-…        2.41421     \delta_{S}^{1}\!\ \!\ =1\delta_{S}+0=[2;2,2,2,2,2,\dots]\approx 2.41421           δ  S  2    =    2   δ  S    +  1   =   [  5  ;  1  ,  4  ,  1  ,  4  ,  1  ,  …  ]   ≈  5.82842         superscript   subscript  δ  S   2       2   subscript  δ  S    1         5  1  4  1  4  1  normal-…        5.82842     \delta_{S}^{2}\!\ \!\ =2\delta_{S}+1=[5;1,4,1,4,1,\dots]\approx 5.82842           δ  S  3    =    5   δ  S    +  2   =   [  14  ;  14  ,  14  ,  14  ,  …  ]   ≈  14.07107         superscript   subscript  δ  S   3       5   subscript  δ  S    2         14  14  14  14  normal-…        14.07107     \delta_{S}^{3}\!\ \!\ =5\delta_{S}+2=[14;14,14,14,\dots]\approx 14.07107           δ  S  4    =    12   δ  S    +  5   =   [  33  ;  1  ,  32  ,  1  ,  32  ,  …  ]   ≈  33.97056         superscript   subscript  δ  S   4       12   subscript  δ  S    5         33  1  32  1  32  normal-…        33.97056     \delta_{S}^{4}\!\ \!\ =12\delta_{S}+5=[33;1,32,1,32,\dots]\approx 33.97056     The powers continue in the pattern       δ  S  n   =     K  n    δ  S    +   K   n  -  1          superscript   subscript  δ  S   n        subscript  K  n    subscript  δ  S     subscript  K    n  1       \delta_{S}^{n}=K_{n}\delta_{S}+K_{n-1}     where       K  n   =    2   K   n  -  1     +   K   n  -  2          subscript  K  n       2   subscript  K    n  1      subscript  K    n  2       K_{n}=2K_{n-1}+K_{n-2}     For example, using this property:        δ   S  5   =    29   δ  S    +  12   =   [  82  ;  82  ,  82  ,  82  ,  …  ]   ≈  82.01219         superscript   subscript  δ  S   5       29   subscript  δ  S    12         82  82  82  82  normal-…        82.01219     \!\ \delta_{S}^{5}=29\delta_{S}+12=[82;82,82,82,\dots]\approx 82.01219     Using 1}} and 2}} as initial conditions, a Binet -like formula results from solving the recurrence relation        K   n   =    2   K   n  -  1     +   K   n  -  2          subscript  K  n       2   subscript  K    n  1      subscript  K    n  2       \!\ K_{n}=2K_{n-1}+K_{n-2}     which becomes        K   n   =    1   2   2      (    δ  S   n  +  1    -    (   2  -   δ  S    )    n  +  1     )         subscript  K  n       1    2    2        superscript   subscript  δ  S     n  1     superscript    2   subscript  δ  S      n  1        \!\ K_{n}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}{(\delta_{S}^{n+1}-{(2-\delta_{S})}^{n+1})}     Trigonometric properties  The silver ratio is intimately connected to trigonometric ratios for 22.5°}} .       sin     1  8    π    =   cos     3  8    π    =     1  2      2  -   2      =      1  2     δ  s   -  1                  1  8   π          3  8   π             1  2       2    2                 1  2    superscript   subscript  δ  s     1         \textstyle\sin\tfrac{1}{8}\pi=\cos\tfrac{3}{8}\pi=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}}%

Paper sizes and silver rectangles  The paper sizes under ISO 216 are rectangles in the proportion 1:    2      2    \sqrt{2}   (approximately 1:1.4142135 decimal), sometimes called "A4 rectangles". Removing a largest possible square from a sheet of such paper leaves a rectangle with proportions 1:    2      2    \sqrt{2}   −1 which is the same as 1+    2      2    \sqrt{2}   :1, the silver ratio. Removing a largest square from one of these sheets leaves one again with aspect ratio 1:    2      2    \sqrt{2}   . A rectangle whose aspect ratio is the silver ratio is sometimes called a silver rectangle by analogy with golden rectangles . Confusingly, "silver rectangle" can also refer to the paper sizes specified by ISO 216.  Removing the largest possible square from either kind yields a silver rectangle of the other kind, and then repeating the process once more gives a rectangle of the original shape but smaller by a linear factor of 1+    2      2    \sqrt{2}   . 1  However, only the    2      2    \sqrt{2}   rectangles (rectangles with the shape of ISO 216 paper) have the property that by cutting the rectangle in half across its long side produces two smaller rectangles of the same aspect ratio.  The silver rectangle is connected to the regular octagon. If a regular octagon is partitioned into two isosceles trapezoids and a rectangle, then the rectangle is a silver rectangle with an aspect ratio of 1:δ S , and the 4 sides of the trapezoids are in a ratio of 1:1:1:δ S . If the edge length of a regular octagon is t , then the inradius of the octagon (the distance between opposite sides) is δ S t , and the area of the octagon is 2δ S t 2 . 2  See also   Metallic means  Ammann–Beenker tiling   References  Further reading   Buitrago, Antonia Redondo (2008).
