   FK-AK space      FK-AK space   In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics an FK-AK space or FK-space with the AK property is an FK-space which contains the space of finite sequences and has a Schauder basis .  Examples and non-examples       c  0     subscript  c  0    c_{0}   the space of convergent sequences with the supremum norm has the AK property       l  p    (  1  ≤  p  <  ∞  )      fragments   superscript  l  p    fragments  normal-(  1   p    normal-)     l^{p}(1\leq p<\infty)   the absolutely p-summable sequences with the    ∥  ⋅   ∥  p      fragments  parallel-to  normal-⋅   subscript  parallel-to  p     \|\cdot\|_{p}   norm have the AK property      l  ∞     superscript  l     l^{\infty}   with the supremum norm does not have the AK property   Properties  An FK-AK space E has the property       E  ′   ≃   E  β      similar-to-or-equals   superscript  E  normal-′    superscript  E  β     E^{\prime}\simeq E^{\beta}   that is the continuous dual of E is linear isomorphic to the beta dual of E .  FK-AK spaces are separable  "  Category:Topological vector spaces
