Racetrack principle

In calculus, the racetrack principle describes the movement and growth of two functions in terms of their derivatives.
This principle is derived from the fact that if a horse named Frank Fleetfeet always runs faster than a horse named Greg Gooseleg, then if Frank and Greg start a race from the same place and the same time, then Frank will win. More briefly, the horse that starts fast and stays fast wins.
In symbols:

if 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , and if 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
 

or, substituting ≥ for > produces the theorem

if 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , and if 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
 

which can be proved in a similar way
Proof
This principle can be proven by considering the function h(x) = f(x) - g(x). If we were to take the derivative we would notice that for x>0



Also notice that h(0) = 0. Combining these observations, we can use the mean value theorem on the interval [0, x] and get



Since x > 0 for the mean value theorem to work then we may conclude that f(x) - g(x) > 0. This implies f(x) > g(x).
Generalizations
The statement of the racetrack principle can slightly generalized as follows;

if 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 
 , and if 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
 

as above, substituting ≥ for > produces the theorem

if 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 
 , and if 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
 

Proof
This generalization can be proved from the racetrack principle as follows:
Given 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 
  where a≥0, and 
 
 
 
 ,
Consider functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

 
  for all 
 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , which by the proof of the racetrack principle above means 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  so 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 
 .
Application
The racetrack principle can be used to prove a lemma necessary to show that the exponential function grows faster than any power function. The lemma required is that


 
  for all real x. This is obvious for x0. To see how it is used we consider the functions


 
  and


 
  Notice that f(0) = g(0) and that


 
  because the exponential function is always increasing (monotonic) so 
 
 
 
 
 . Thus by the racetrack principle f(x)>g(x). Thus,


 
  for all x>0.
