   Racetrack principle      Racetrack principle   In calculus , the racetrack principle describes the movement and growth of two functions in terms of their derivatives .  This principle is derived from the fact that if a horse named Frank Fleetfeet always runs faster than a horse named Greg Gooseleg, then if Frank and Greg start a race from the same place and the same time, then Frank will win. More briefly, the horse that starts fast and stays fast wins.  In symbols:   if      f  ′    (  x  )    >    g  ′    (  x  )           superscript  f  normal-′   x      superscript  g  normal-′   x     f^{\prime}(x)>g^{\prime}(x)   for all    x  >  0      x  0    x>0   , and if     f   (  0  )    =   g   (  0  )          f  0     g  0     f(0)=g(0)   , then     f   (  x  )    >   g   (  x  )          f  x     g  x     f(x)>g(x)   for all    x  >  0      x  0    x>0   .   or, substituting ≥ for > produces the theorem   if      f  ′    (  x  )    ≥    g  ′    (  x  )           superscript  f  normal-′   x      superscript  g  normal-′   x     f^{\prime}(x)\geq g^{\prime}(x)   for all    x  >  0      x  0    x>0   , and if     f   (  0  )    =   g   (  0  )          f  0     g  0     f(0)=g(0)   , then     f   (  x  )    ≥   g   (  x  )          f  x     g  x     f(x)\geq g(x)   for all    x  >  0      x  0    x>0   .   which can be proved in a similar way  Proof  This principle can be proven by considering the function h(x) = f(x) - g(x). If we were to take the derivative we would notice that for x>0       h  ′   =    f  ′   -   g  ′    >  0.         superscript  h  normal-′      superscript  f  normal-′    superscript  g  normal-′         0.     h^{\prime}=f^{\prime}-g^{\prime}>0.     Also notice that h(0) = 0. Combining these observations, we can use the mean value theorem on the interval [0, x] and get        h  ′    (   x  0   )    =     h   (  x  )    -   h   (  0  )      x  -  0    =     f   (  x  )    -   g   (  x  )     x   >  0.           superscript  h  normal-′    subscript  x  0          h  x     h  0      x  0               f  x     g  x    x        0.     h^{\prime}(x_{0})=\frac{h(x)-h(0)}{x-0}=\frac{f(x)-g(x)}{x}>0.     Since x > 0 for the mean value theorem to work then we may conclude that f(x) - g(x) > 0. This implies f(x) > g(x).  Generalizations  The statement of the racetrack principle can slightly generalized as follows;   if      f  ′    (  x  )    >    g  ′    (  x  )           superscript  f  normal-′   x      superscript  g  normal-′   x     f^{\prime}(x)>g^{\prime}(x)   for all    x  >  a      x  a    x>a   , and if     f   (  a  )    =   g   (  a  )          f  a     g  a     f(a)=g(a)   , then     f   (  x  )    >   g   (  x  )          f  x     g  x     f(x)>g(x)   for all    x  >  a      x  a    x>a   .   as above, substituting ≥ for > produces the theorem   if      f  ′    (  x  )    ≥    g  ′    (  x  )           superscript  f  normal-′   x      superscript  g  normal-′   x     f^{\prime}(x)\geq g^{\prime}(x)   for all    x  >  a      x  a    x>a   , and if     f   (  a  )    =   g   (  a  )          f  a     g  a     f(a)=g(a)   , then     f   (  x  )    ≥   g   (  x  )          f  x     g  x     f(x)\geq g(x)   for all    x  >  a      x  a    x>a   .   Proof  This generalization can be proved from the racetrack principle as follows:  Given      f  ′    (  x  )    >    g  ′    (  x  )           superscript  f  normal-′   x      superscript  g  normal-′   x     f^{\prime}(x)>g^{\prime}(x)   for all    x  >  a      x  a    x>a   where a≥0, and     f   (  a  )    =   g   (  a  )          f  a     g  a     f(a)=g(a)   ,  Consider functions      f  2    (  x  )    =   f   (   x  -  a   )           subscript  f  2   x     f    x  a      f_{2}(x)=f(x-a)   and      g  2    (  x  )    =   g   (   x  -  a   )           subscript  g  2   x     g    x  a      g_{2}(x)=g(x-a)         f  2  ′    (  x  )    >    g  2  ′    (  x  )           superscript   subscript  f  2   normal-′   x      superscript   subscript  g  2   normal-′   x     f_{2}^{\prime}(x)>g_{2}^{\prime}(x)   for all    x  >  0      x  0    x>0   , and      f  2    (  0  )    =    g  2    (  0  )           subscript  f  2   0      subscript  g  2   0     f_{2}(0)=g_{2}(0)   , which by the proof of the racetrack principle above means      f  2    (  x  )    >    g  2    (  x  )           subscript  f  2   x      subscript  g  2   x     f_{2}(x)>g_{2}(x)   for all    x  >  0      x  0    x>0   so     f   (  x  )    >   g   (  x  )          f  x     g  x     f(x)>g(x)   for all    x  >  a      x  a    x>a   .  Application  The racetrack principle can be used to prove a lemma necessary to show that the exponential function grows faster than any power function. The lemma required is that       e  x   >  x       superscript  e  x   x    e^{x}>x   for all real x. This is obvious for x0. To see how it is used we consider the functions       f   (  x  )    =   e  x         f  x    superscript  e  x     f(x)=e^{x}   and       g   (  x  )    =   x  +  1.         g  x     x  1.     g(x)=x+1.   Notice that f(0) = g(0) and that       e  x   >  1       superscript  e  x   1    e^{x}>1   because the exponential function is always increasing ( monotonic ) so      f  ′    (  x  )    >    g  ′    (  x  )           superscript  f  normal-′   x      superscript  g  normal-′   x     f^{\prime}(x)>g^{\prime}(x)   . Thus by the racetrack principle f(x)>g(x). Thus,       e  x   >   x  +  1   >  x         superscript  e  x     x  1        x     e^{x}>x+1>x   for all x>0.
