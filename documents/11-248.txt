   (S)-norcoclaurine synthase      (S)-norcoclaurine synthase   In enzymology , a (S)-norcoclaurine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde + 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-1,2-diol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (S)-norcoclaurine + H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-1,2-diol , whereas its two products are (S)- norcoclaurine and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde hydro-lyase [adding dopamine (S)-norcoclaurine-forming] . Other names in common use include (S)-norlaudanosoline synthase , and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde hydro-lyase (adding dopamine) . This enzyme participates in benzylisoquinoline  alkaloid  biosynthesis .  References       "  Category:EC 4.2.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
