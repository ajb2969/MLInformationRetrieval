24-hydroxycholesterol 7α-hydroxylase

24-hydroxycholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (, 24-hydroxycholesterol 7alpha-monooxygenase, CYP39A1, CYP39A1 oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase) is an enzyme with system name (24R)-cholest-5-ene-3beta,24-diol,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (7alpha-hydroxylating).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(24R)-cholest-5-ene-3beta,24-diol + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  (24R)-cholest-5-ene-3beta,7alpha,24-triol + NADP+ + H2O
 

24-hydroxycholesterol 7α-hydroxylase is a heme-thiolate protein (P-450) .
