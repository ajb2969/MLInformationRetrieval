5-(3,4-diacetoxybut-1-ynyl)-2,2'-bithiophene deacetylase

In enzymology, a 5-(3,4-diacetoxybut-1-ynyl)-2,2'-bithiophene deacetylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

5-(3,4-diacetoxybut-1-ynyl)-2,2'-bithiophene + H2O 
 
 
 
  5-(3-hydroxy-4-acetoxybut-1-ynyl)-2,2'-bithiophene + acetate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5-(3,4-diacetoxybut-1-ynyl)-2,2'-bithiophene and H2O, whereas its two products are 5-(3-hydroxy-4-acetoxybut-1-ynyl)-2,2'-bithiophene and acetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-(3,4-diacetoxybut-1-ynyl)-2,2'-bithiophene acetylhydrolase. Other names in common use include diacetoxybutynylbithiophene acetate esterase, and 3,4-diacetoxybutinylbithiophene:4-acetate esterase.
