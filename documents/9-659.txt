   Supersymmetry as a quantum group      Supersymmetry as a quantum group   The concept in theoretical physics of supersymmetry can be reinterpreted in the language of noncommutative geometry and quantum groups . In particular, it involves a mild form of noncommutativity , namely supercommutativity .  Unitary (-1) F operator  Following is the essence of supersymmetry, which is encapsulated within the following minimal quantum group . We have the two dimensional Hopf algebra generated by (-1)F subject to        (   -  1   )    F   2   =  1       superscript   superscript    1   F   2   1    {(-1)^{F}}^{2}=1     with the counit       ϵ   (    (   -  1   )   F   )    =  1        ϵ   superscript    1   F    1    \epsilon((-1)^{F})=1     and the coproduct       Δ    (   -  1   )   F    =     (   -  1   )   F   ⊗    (   -  1   )   F          normal-Δ   superscript    1   F     tensor-product   superscript    1   F    superscript    1   F      \Delta(-1)^{F}=(-1)^{F}\otimes(-1)^{F}     and the antipode       S    (   -  1   )   F    =    (   -  1   )   F         S   superscript    1   F     superscript    1   F     S(-1)^{F}=(-1)^{F}     Thus far, there is nothing supersymmetric about this Hopf algebra at all; it is isomorphic to the Hopf algebra of the two element group    ℤ  2     subscript  ℤ  2    \mathbb{Z}_{2}   . Supersymmetry comes in when introducing the nontrivial quasitriangular structure      ℛ  =    1  2    [     1  ⊗  1   +     (   -  1   )   F   ⊗  1   +   1  ⊗    (   -  1   )   F     -     (   -  1   )   F   ⊗    (   -  1   )   F     ]        ℛ      1  2    delimited-[]       tensor-product  1  1    tensor-product   superscript    1   F   1    tensor-product  1   superscript    1   F      tensor-product   superscript    1   F    superscript    1   F         \mathcal{R}=\frac{1}{2}\left[1\otimes 1+(-1)^{F}\otimes 1+1\otimes(-1)^{F}-(-1%
 )^{F}\otimes(-1)^{F}\right]     where +1 eigenstates of (-1) F are called bosons and -1 eigenstates are called fermions.  This describes a fermionic  braiding ; don't pick up a phase factor when interchanging two bosons or a boson and a fermion, but multiply by -1 when interchanging two fermions. This provides the essence of the boson/fermion distinction.  Fermionic operators  The previous analysis only introduced the concept of fermions, and is not actual supersymmetry. The Hopf algebra is    ℤ  2     subscript  ℤ  2    \mathbb{Z}_{2}   graded and contains even and odd elements. Even elements commute with (-1) F ; odd ones anticommute . The subalgebra not containing (-1)^F is supercommutative.  Let's say we are dealing with a super Lie algebra with even generators x and odd generators y.  Then,       Δ  x   =    x  ⊗  1   +   1  ⊗  x          normal-Δ  x      tensor-product  x  1    tensor-product  1  x      \Delta x=x\otimes 1+1\otimes x          Δ  y   =    y  ⊗  1   +     (   -  1   )   F   ⊗  y          normal-Δ  y      tensor-product  y  1    tensor-product   superscript    1   F   y      \Delta y=y\otimes 1+(-1)^{F}\otimes y     This is compatible with   ℛ   ℛ   \mathcal{R}   .  Supersymmetry is the symmetry over systems where interchanging two fermions attain a minus sign.
