Adenosylhomocysteinase

Adenosylhomocysteinase (, S-adenosylhomocysteine synthase, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, S-adenosylhomocysteinase, SAHase, AdoHcyase) is an enzyme that converts S-adenosylhomocysteine to homocysteine and adenosine.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + H2O 
 
 
 
  L-homocysteine + adenosine


The enzyme contains one tightly bound NAD+ per subunit.
