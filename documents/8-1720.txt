Maximal pair

In computer science, a maximal pair is a tuple

 
 , such that, given a string 
 
 
 
  of length 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , but 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . A maximal repeat is a string represented by such tuple. A supermaximal repeat is a maximal repeat never occurring as a proper substring of another maximal repeat. Both maximal pairs, maximal repeats and supermaximal repeats can be found in 
 
 
 
  time using a suffix tree,1 if there are 
 
 
 
  such structures.
Example
12345678901234
xabcyabcwabcyz


 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are maximal pairs, but 
 
 
 
  is not, as y follows both substrings. abc and abcy are maximal repeats, but only abcy is a supermaximal repeat.
