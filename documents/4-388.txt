   Tree (set theory)      Tree (set theory)   In set theory , a tree is a partially ordered set ( T ,  ω, then there is no natural edge relation that will make T a tree in the sense of graph theory. For example, the set     ω  +  1   =   {  0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  ω  }         ω  1    0  1  2  normal-…  ω     \omega+1=\left\{0,1,2,\dots,\omega\right\}   does not have a natural edge relationship, as there is no predecessor to ω.  A branch of a tree is a maximal chain in the tree (that is, any two elements of the branch are comparable, and any element of the tree not in the branch is incomparable with at least one element of the branch). The length of a branch is the ordinal that is order isomorphic to the branch. For each ordinal α, the α-th level of T is the set of all elements of T of height α. A tree is a κ-tree, for an ordinal number κ, if and only if it has height κ and every level has size less than the cardinality of κ. The width of a tree is the supremum of the cardinalities of its levels.  Single-rooted trees of height ≤ ω forms a meet-semilattice, where meet (common ancestor) is given by maximal element of intersection of ancestors, which exists as the set of ancestors is non-empty and finite well-ordered, hence has a maximal element. Without a single root, the intersection of parents can be empty (two elements need not have common ancestors), for example    {  a  ,  b  }     a  b    \left\{a,b\right\}   where the elements are not comparable; while if there are an infinite number of ancestors there need not be a maximal element – for example,    {  0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,   ω  0   ,   ω  1   }     0  1  2  normal-…   subscript  ω  0    subscript  ω  1     \left\{0,1,2,\dots,\omega_{0},\omega_{1}\right\}   where     ω  0   ,   ω  1       subscript  ω  0    subscript  ω  1     \omega_{0},\omega_{1}   are not comparable.  Properties  There are some fairly simply stated yet hard problems in infinite tree theory. Examples of this are the Kurepa conjecture and the Suslin conjecture . Both of these problems are known to be independent of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory . König's lemma states that every ω-tree has an infinite branch. On the other hand, it is a theorem of ZFC that there are uncountable trees with no uncountable branches and no uncountable levels; such trees are known as Aronszajn trees . A κ- Suslin tree is a tree of height κ which has no chains or antichains of size κ. In particular, if κ is singular (i.e. not regular ) then there exists a κ-Aronszajn tree and a κ-Suslin tree. In fact, for any infinite cardinal κ, every κ-Suslin tree is a κ-Aronszajn tree (the converse does not hold).  The Suslin conjecture was originally stated as a question about certain total orderings but it is equivalent to the statement: Every tree of height ω 1 has an antichain of cardinality ω 1 or a branch of length ω 1 .  Tree (automata theory)  Following definition of a tree is slightly different from the above formalism. For example, each node of the tree is a word over set of natural numbers (ℕ), which helps this definition to be used in automata theory .  A tree is a set T ⊆ ℕ * such that if t . c ∈ T , with t ∈ ℕ * and c ∈ ℕ, then t ∈ T and t . c 1 ∈ T for all 0 ≤ c 1 * and Σ = { a , b }. We define a labeling function V as follows: the labeling for the root node is V (ε) = a and, for every other node t ∈ {0,1} * , the labellings for its successor nodes are V ( t .0) = a and V ( t .1) = b . It is clear from the picture that T forms a (fully) infinite binary tree.
