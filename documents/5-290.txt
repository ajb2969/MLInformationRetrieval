Advanced Z-transform

In mathematics and signal processing, the advanced Z-transform is an extension of the Z-transform, to incorporate ideal delays that are not multiples of the sampling time. It takes the form



where

T is the sampling period
m (the "delay parameter") is a fraction of the sampling period 
 
 


It is also known as the modified Z-transform.
The advanced Z-transform is widely applied, for example to accurately model processing delays in digital control.
Properties
If the delay parameter, m, is considered fixed then all the properties of the Z-transform hold for the advanced Z-transform.
Linearity



Time shift



Damping



Time multiplication



Final value theorem



Example
Consider the following example where 
 
 
 
 :



If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  reduces to the transform


 
 ,
which is clearly just the Z-transform of
