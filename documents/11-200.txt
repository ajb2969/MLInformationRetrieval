   Ent-kaurene synthase      Ent-kaurene synthase   In enzymology , an ent-kaurene synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ent-copalyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ent-kaurene + diphosphate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , ent-copalyl diphosphate , and two products , ent-kaurene and diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ent-copalyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, ent-kaurene-forming) . Other names in common use include ent-kaurene synthase B , ent-kaurene synthetase B, ent-copalyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase , and (cyclizing) . This enzyme participates in diterpenoid biosynthesis .  References        "  Category:EC 4.2.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
