Acetate CoA-transferase




Acetate CoA-transferase

In enzymology, an acetate CoA-transferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acyl-CoA + acetate 
 
 
 
  a fatty acid anion + acetyl-CoA
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and acetate, whereas its two products are fatty acid anion and acetyl-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the CoA-transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase. Other names in common use include acetate coenzyme A-transferase, butyryl CoA:acetate CoA transferase, butyryl coenzyme A transferase, and succinyl-CoA:acetate CoA transferase. This enzyme participates in 4 metabolic pathways: benzoate degradation via coa ligation, propanoate metabolism, butanoate metabolism, and two-component system - general.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
