   Behrens–Fisher distribution      Behrens–Fisher distribution   In statistics , the Behrens–Fisher distribution , named after Ronald Fisher and W. V. Behrens , is a parameterized family of probability distributions arising from the solution of the Behrens–Fisher problem proposed first by Behrens and several years later by Fisher. The Behrens–Fisher problem is that of statistical inference concerning the difference between the means of two normally distributed  populations when the ratio of their variances is not known (and in particular, it is not known that their variances are equal).  Definition  The Behrens–Fisher distribution is the distribution of a random variable of the form        T  2    cos  θ    -    T  1    sin   θ            subscript  T  2     θ       subscript  T  1     θ      T_{2}\cos\theta-T_{1}\sin\theta\,     where T 1 and T 2 are independent  random variables each with a Student's t-distribution , with respective degrees of freedom ν 1 = n 1 − 1 and ν 2 = n 2 − 1, and θ is a constant. Thus the family of Behrens–Fisher distributions is parametrized by ν 1 , ν 2 , and θ .  Derivation  Suppose it were known that the two population variances are equal, and samples of sizes n 1 and n 2 are taken from the two populations:       X   1  ,  1    ,  …  ,   X   1  ,   n  1         subscript  X   1  1    normal-…   subscript  X   1   subscript  n  1       \displaystyle X_{1,1},\ldots,X_{1,n_{1}}     where "i.i.d" are independent and identically distributed random variables and N denotes the normal distribution . The two sample means are       X  ¯   1     subscript   normal-¯  X   1    \displaystyle\bar{X}_{1}     The usual " pooled " unbiased estimate of the common variance σ 2 is then       S  pooled  2   =      ∑   k  =  1    n  1      (    X   1  ,  k    -    X  ¯   1    )   2    +    ∑   k  =  1    n  2      (    X   2  ,  k    -    X  ¯   2    )   2        n  1   +   n  2    -  2    =      (    n  1   -  1   )    S  1  2    +    (    n  2   -  1   )    S  2  2        n  1   +   n  2    -  2           superscript   subscript  S  pooled   2         superscript   subscript     k  1     subscript  n  1     superscript     subscript  X   1  k     subscript   normal-¯  X   1    2      superscript   subscript     k  1     subscript  n  2     superscript     subscript  X   2  k     subscript   normal-¯  X   2    2          subscript  n  1    subscript  n  2    2                  subscript  n  1   1    superscript   subscript  S  1   2         subscript  n  2   1    superscript   subscript  S  2   2          subscript  n  1    subscript  n  2    2       S_{\mathrm{pooled}}^{2}=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n_{1}}(X_{1,k}-\bar{X}_{1})^{2}+\sum%
 _{k=1}^{n_{2}}(X_{2,k}-\bar{X}_{2})^{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}-2}=\frac{(n_{1}-1)S_{1}^{%
 2}+(n_{2}-1)S_{2}^{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}-2}     where S 1 2 and S 2 2 are the usual unbiased ( Bessel-corrected ) estimates of the two population variances.  Under these assumptions, the pivotal quantity        (    μ  2   -   μ  1    )   -   (     X  ¯   2   -    X  ¯   1    )         S  pooled  2    n  1     +     S  pooled  2    n  2                subscript  μ  2    subscript  μ  1       subscript   normal-¯  X   2    subscript   normal-¯  X   1            subscript   superscript  S  2   pooled    subscript  n  1       subscript   superscript  S  2   pooled    subscript  n  2        \frac{(\mu_{2}-\mu_{1})-(\bar{X}_{2}-\bar{X}_{1})}{\displaystyle\sqrt{\frac{S^%
 {2}_{\mathrm{pooled}}}{n_{1}}+\frac{S^{2}_{\mathrm{pooled}}}{n_{2}}}}     has a t-distribution with n 1 + n 2 − 2 degrees of freedom . Accordingly, one can find a confidence interval for μ 2 − μ 1 whose endpoints are          X  ¯   2   -    X  1   ¯    ±    A  ⋅   S  pooled       1   n  1    +   1   n  2        ,     plus-or-minus     subscript   normal-¯  X   2    normal-¯   subscript  X  1        normal-⋅  A   subscript  S  pooled          1   subscript  n  1      1   subscript  n  2         \bar{X}_{2}-\bar{X_{1}}\pm A\cdot S_{\mathrm{pooled}}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{1}}+%
 \frac{1}{n_{2}}},     where A is an appropriate percentage point of the t-distribution.  However, in the Behrens–Fisher problem, the two population variances are not known to be equal, nor is their ratio known. Fisher considered the pivotal quantity         (    μ  2   -   μ  1    )   -   (     X  ¯   2   -    X  ¯   1    )         S  1  2    n  1     +     S  2  2    n  2        .           subscript  μ  2    subscript  μ  1       subscript   normal-¯  X   2    subscript   normal-¯  X   1            subscript   superscript  S  2   1    subscript  n  1       subscript   superscript  S  2   2    subscript  n  2        \frac{(\mu_{2}-\mu_{1})-(\bar{X}_{2}-\bar{X}_{1})}{\displaystyle\sqrt{\frac{S^%
 {2}_{1}}{n_{1}}+\frac{S^{2}_{2}}{n_{2}}}}.     This can be written as         T  2    cos  θ    -    T  1    sin  θ     ,         subscript  T  2     θ       subscript  T  1     θ      T_{2}\cos\theta-T_{1}\sin\theta,\,     where        T  i   =      μ  i   -    X  ¯   i      S  i   /    n  i      for  i   =  1   ,   2      formulae-sequence       subscript  T  i          subscript  μ  i    subscript   normal-¯  X   i       subscript  S  i      subscript  n  i      for  i        1    2    T_{i}=\frac{\mu_{i}-\bar{X}_{i}}{S_{i}/\sqrt{n_{i}}}\text{ for }i=1,2\,     are the usual one-sample t-statistics and       tan  θ   =     S  1   /    n  1       S  2   /    n  2            θ        subscript  S  1      subscript  n  1        subscript  S  2      subscript  n  2        \tan\theta=\frac{S_{1}/\sqrt{n_{1}}}{S_{2}/\sqrt{n_{2}}}     and one takes θ to be in the first quadrant. The algebraic details are as follows:         (    μ  2   -   μ  1    )   -   (     X  ¯   2   -    X  ¯   1    )         S  1  2    n  1     +     S  2  2    n  2                 subscript  μ  2    subscript  μ  1       subscript   normal-¯  X   2    subscript   normal-¯  X   1            subscript   superscript  S  2   1    subscript  n  1       subscript   superscript  S  2   2    subscript  n  2        \displaystyle\frac{(\mu_{2}-\mu_{1})-(\bar{X}_{2}-\bar{X}_{1})}{\displaystyle%
 \sqrt{\frac{S^{2}_{1}}{n_{1}}+\frac{S^{2}_{2}}{n_{2}}}}     The fact that the sum of the squares of the expressions in parentheses above is 1 implies that they are the cosine and sine of some angle.  The Behren–Fisher distribution is actually the conditional distribution of the quantity (1) above, given the values of the quantities labeled cos θ and sin θ . In effect, Fisher conditions on ancillary information .  Fisher then found the " fiducial interval" whose endpoints are         X  ¯   2   -    X  ¯   1    ±   A      S  1  2    n  1    +    S  2  2    n  2          plus-or-minus     subscript   normal-¯  X   2    subscript   normal-¯  X   1      A         superscript   subscript  S  1   2    subscript  n  1       superscript   subscript  S  2   2    subscript  n  2         \bar{X}_{2}-\bar{X}_{1}\pm A\sqrt{\frac{S_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}}+\frac{S_{2}^{2}}{n_{%
 2}}}     where A is the appropriate percentage point of the Behrens–Fisher distribution. Fisher claimed that the probability that μ 2 − μ 1 is in this interval, given the data (ultimately the X s) is the probability that a Behrens–Fisher-distributed random variable is between − A and A .  Fiducial intervals versus confidence intervals  Bartlett showed that this "fiducial interval" is not a confidence interval because it does not have a constant coverage rate. Fisher did not consider that a cogent objection to the use of the fiducial interval.
