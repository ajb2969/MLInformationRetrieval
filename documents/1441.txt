   Milü      Milü   (Figure)  Fractional approximations to   π   π   \pi   .   The name Milü (; "detailed (approximation) ratio"), also known as Zulü ( Zu 's ratio), is given to an approximation to    π   π   \pi    ( pi ) found by Chinese mathematician and astronomer  Zǔ Chōngzhī (祖沖之) . He computed   π   π   \pi   to be between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927 and gave two rational approximations of   π   π   \pi   ,    22  7      22  7    \frac{22}{7}   and    355  113      355  113    \frac{355}{113}   , naming them respectively Yuelü 约率 (approximate ratio) and Milü .      355  113      355  113    \frac{355}{113}   is the best rational approximation of   π   π   \pi   with a denominator of four digits or fewer, being accurate to 6 decimal places. It is within 0.000009% of the value of   π   π   \pi   , or in terms of common fractions overestimates   π   π   \pi   by less than    1  3748629      1  3748629    \frac{1}{3748629}   . The next rational number (ordered by size of denominator) that is a better rational approximation of   π   π   \pi   is    52163  16604      52163  16604    \frac{52163}{16604}   , still only correct to 6 decimal places and hardly closer to   π   π   \pi   than    355  113      355  113    \frac{355}{113}   . To be accurate to 7 decimal places, one needs to go as far as    86953  27678      86953  27678    \frac{86953}{27678}   . For 8, we need    102928  32763      102928  32763    \frac{102928}{32763}   .     π   π   \displaystyle\pi     An easy mnemonic helps memorize this useful fraction by writing down each of the first three odd numbers twice: 1 1 3 3 5 5, then dividing the decimal number represented by the last 3 digits by the decimal number given by the first three digits.  Zu's contemporary calendarist and mathematician He Chengtian ( 何承天 ) invented a fraction interpolation method called "harmonization of the divisor of the day" to obtain a closer approximation by iteratively adding the numerators and denominators of a "weak" fraction and a "strong" fraction. 1  Zu Chongzhi 's approximation   π   π   \pi   ≈    355  113      355  113    \frac{355}{113}   can be obtained with He Chengtian's method 2  See also   Continued fraction expansions of   π   π   \pi     History of numerical approximations of   π   π   \pi     Pi Approximation Day   External links   Fractional Approximations of Pi   References  "  Category:Pi     ↩  Wu Wenjun ed Grand Series of History of Chinese Mathematics vol 4 p125 ↩
