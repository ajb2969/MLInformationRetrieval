   Genocchi number      Genocchi number   In mathematics , the Genocchi numbers G n , named after Angelo Genocchi , are a sequence of integers that satisfy the relation        2  t     e  t   +  1    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     G  n     t  n    n  !              2  t      superscript  e  t   1      superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  G  n      superscript  t  n     n        \frac{2t}{e^{t}+1}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}G_{n}\frac{t^{n}}{n!}     The first few Genocchi numbers are 1, −1, 0, 1, 0, −3, 0, 17 , see .  Properties   The generating function definition of the Genocchi numbers implies that they are rational numbers . In fact, G 2n+1 = 0 for n ≥ 1 and (−1) n G 2n is an odd positive integer.    Genocchi numbers G n are related to Bernoulli numbers  B n by the formula         G  n   =    2    (   1  -   2  n    )    B  n     .       subscript  G  n     2    1   superscript  2  n     subscript  B  n      G_{n}=2\,(1-2^{n})\,B_{n}.     There are two cases for    G  n     subscript  G  n    G_{n}   .   1.     B  1   =   -   1  /  2         subscript  B  1       1  2      B_{1}=-1/2   from  /     G   n  1      subscript  G   subscript  n  1     G_{n_{1}}   = 1, -1, 0, 1, 0, -3 = , see   2.     B  1   =   1  /  2        subscript  B  1     1  2     B_{1}=1/2   from  /     G   n  2      subscript  G   subscript  n  2     G_{n_{2}}   = -1, -1, 0, 1, 0, -3 = . Generating function     -  2    1  +   e   -  t           2     1   superscript  e    t       \frac{-2}{1+e^{-t}}   .    is an autosequence (a sequence whose inverse binomial transform is the signed sequence) of the first kind (its main diagonal is 0's = ). An autosequence of the second kind has its main diagonal equal to the first upper diagonal multiplied by 2. Example:  / .  − is included in the family:         style="text-align:center;" style="padding: 1.5em;|...     style="text-align:center;" style="padding: 1.5em;|...     style="text-align:center;" style="padding: 1.5em;|0     The rows are respectively (n) / (n+1), −, and .  A row is 0 followed by n (positive) multiplied by the preceding row. The sequences are alternatively of the second and the first kind.   It has been proved that −3 and 17 are the only prime Genocchi numbers.   Combinatorial interpretations  The exponential generating function for the signed even Genocchi numbers (−1) n G 2n is       t   tan   (   t  2   )     =    ∑   n  ≥  1       (   -  1   )   n    G   2  n      t   2  n      (   2  n   )   !            t      t  2       subscript     n  1       superscript    1   n    subscript  G    2  n       superscript  t    2  n        2  n         t\tan(\frac{t}{2})=\sum_{n\geq 1}(-1)^{n}G_{2n}\frac{t^{2n}}{(2n)!}     They enumerate the following objects:   Permutations in S 2 n −1 with descents after the even numbers and ascents after the odd numbers.    Permutations π in S 2 n −2 with 1 ≤ π (2 i −1) ≤ 2 n −2 i and 2 n −2 i ≤ π (2 i ) ≤ 2 n −2.    Pairs ( a 1 ,…, a n −1 ) and ( b 1 ,…, b n −1 ) such that a i and b i are between 1 and i and every k between 1 and n −1 occurs at least once among the a i 's and b i 's.    Reverse alternating permutations  a 1 2 > a 3 4 >…> a 2 n −1 of [2 n −1] whose inversion table has only even entries.   See also   Euler number   References      Richard P. Stanley (1999).
