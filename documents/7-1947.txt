Genocchi number

In mathematics, the Genocchi numbers Gn, named after Angelo Genocchi, are a sequence of integers that satisfy the relation



The first few Genocchi numbers are 1, −1, 0, 1, 0, −3, 0, 17 , see .
Properties

The generating function definition of the Genocchi numbers implies that they are rational numbers. In fact, G2n+1 = 0 for n ≥ 1 and (−1)nG2n is an odd positive integer.


Genocchi numbers Gn are related to Bernoulli numbers Bn by the formula

is an autosequence (a sequence whose inverse binomial transform is the signed sequence) of the first kind (its main diagonal is 0's = ). An autosequence of the second kind has its main diagonal equal to the first upper diagonal multiplied by 2. Example:  / .

The rows are respectively (n) / (n+1), −, and .
A row is 0 followed by n (positive) multiplied by the preceding row. The sequences are alternatively of the second and the first kind.

It has been proved that −3 and 17 are the only prime Genocchi numbers.

Combinatorial interpretations
The exponential generating function for the signed even Genocchi numbers (−1)nG2n is



They enumerate the following objects:

Permutations in S2n−1 with descents after the even numbers and ascents after the odd numbers.


Permutations π in S2n−2 with 1 ≤ π(2i−1) ≤ 2n−2i and 2n−2i ≤ π(2i) ≤ 2n−2.


Pairs (a1,…,an−1) and (b1,…,bn−1) such that ai and bi are between 1 and i and every k between 1 and n−1 occurs at least once among the ai's and bi's.


Reverse alternating permutations a1 2 > a3 4 >…>a2n−1 of [2n−1] whose inversion table has only even entries.
