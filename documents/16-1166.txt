Vincent average

In applied statistics, Vincentization1 was described by Ratcliff (1979), and is named after biologist S. B. Vincent (1912), who used something very similar to it for constructing learning curves at the beginning of the 1900s. It basically consists of averaging n > 2 subjects' estimated or elicited quantile functions in order to define group quantiles from which F can be constructed.
To cast it in its greatest generality, let F1,..., Fn represent arbitrary (empirical or theoretical) distribution functions and define their corresponding quantile functions by



The Vincent average of the Fis is then computed as



where the non-negative numbers w1,..., wn have a sum of 1.
