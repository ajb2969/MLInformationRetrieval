   Vincent average      Vincent average   In applied statistics , Vincentization 1 was described by Ratcliff (1979), and is named after biologist S. B. Vincent (1912), who used something very similar to it for constructing learning curves at the beginning of the 1900s. It basically consists of averaging n > 2 subjects' estimated or elicited quantile functions in order to define group quantiles from which F can be constructed.  To cast it in its greatest generality, let F 1 ,..., F n represent arbitrary (empirical or theoretical) distribution functions and define their corresponding quantile functions by       F  i   -  1     (  α  )   =  inf   {  t  ∈  ℝ  :   F  i    (  t  )   ≥  α  )   }  ,  0  <  α  <  1.     fragments   superscript   subscript  F  i     1     fragments  normal-(  α  normal-)    infimum   fragments  normal-{  t   R  normal-:   subscript  F  i    fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)    α  normal-)   normal-}  normal-,  0   α   1.    F_{i}^{-1}(\alpha)=\inf\{t\in\mathbb{R}:F_{i}(t)\geq\alpha)\},\quad 0<\alpha<1.     The Vincent average of the F i s is then computed as          F   -  1     (  α  )    =   ∑   𝔼   w  i    F  i   -  1     (  α  )      ,   0  <  α  <  1    ,   i  =   1  ,  …  ,  n       formulae-sequence   formulae-sequence       superscript  F    1    α       𝔼   subscript  w  i    superscript   subscript  F  i     1    α         0  α       1       i   1  normal-…  n      F^{-1}(\alpha)=\sum\mathbb{E}w_{i}F_{i}^{-1}(\alpha),\quad 0<\alpha<1,\quad i=%
