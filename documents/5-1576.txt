   Power closed      Power closed   In mathematics a p-group    G   G   G   is called power closed if for every section    H   H   H   of   G   G   G   the product of    p  k     superscript  p  k    p^{k}   powers is again a    p  k     superscript  p  k    p^{k}   th power.  Regular p-groups are an example of power closed groups. On the other hand, powerful p-groups , for which the product of    p  k     superscript  p  k    p^{k}   powers is again a    p  k     superscript  p  k    p^{k}   th power are not power closed, as this property does not hold for all sections of powerful p-groups.  The power closed 2-groups of exponent at least eight are described in .  References     "  Category:Group theory  Category:P-groups
