Power closed

In mathematics a p-group

 
  is called power closed if for every section

 
  of 
 
 
 
  the product of 
 
 
 
  powers is again a 
 
 
 
 th power.
Regular p-groups are an example of power closed groups. On the other hand, powerful p-groups, for which the product of 
 
 
 
  powers is again a 
 
 
 
 th power are not power closed, as this property does not hold for all sections of powerful p-groups.
The power closed 2-groups of exponent at least eight are described in .
