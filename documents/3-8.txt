   Cover (topology)      Cover (topology)   In mathematics , a cover of a set    X   X   X   is a collection of sets whose union contains   X   X   X   as a subset . Formally, if      C  =   {   U  α   :   α  ∈  A   }       C   conditional-set   subscript  U  α     α  A      C=\{U_{\alpha}:\alpha\in A\}   is an indexed family of sets    U  α     subscript  U  α    U_{\alpha}   , then   C   C   C   is a cover of   X   X   X   if       X  ⊆    ⋃   α  ∈  A     U  α     .      X    subscript     α  A     subscript  U  α      X\subseteq\bigcup_{\alpha\in A}U_{\alpha}.     Cover in topology  Covers are commonly used in the context of topology . If the set X is a topological space , then a cover  C of X is a collection of subsets U α of X whose union is the whole space X . In this case we say that C  covers  X , or that the sets U α  cover  X . Also, if Y is a subset of X , then a cover of Y is a collection of subsets of X whose union contains Y , i.e., C is a cover of Y if      Y  ⊆    ⋃   α  ∈  A     U  α        Y    subscript     α  A     subscript  U  α      Y\subseteq\bigcup_{\alpha\in A}U_{\alpha}     Let C be a cover of a topological space X . A subcover of C is a subset of C that still covers X .  We say that C is an open cover if each of its members is an open set (i.e. each U α is contained in T , where T is the topology on X ).  A cover of X is said to be locally finite if every point of X has a neighborhood which intersects only finitely many sets in the cover. Formally, C = { U α } is locally finite if for any x ∈ X , there exists some neighborhood N ( x ) of x such that the set      {   α  ∈  A   :     U  α   ∩   N   (  x  )     ≠  ∅   }     conditional-set    α  A        subscript  U  α     N  x        \left\{\alpha\in A:U_{\alpha}\cap N(x)\neq\varnothing\right\}   is finite. A cover of X is said to be point finite if every point of X is contained in only finitely many sets in the cover. (locally finite implies point finite)  Refinement  A refinement of a cover C of a topological space X is a new cover D of X such that every set in D is contained in some set in C . Formally,      D  =   V   β  ∈  B        D   subscript  V    β  B      D=V_{\beta\in B}   is a refinement of        U   α  ∈  A    when   ∀    β    ∃    α    V  β        ⊆   U  α         subscript  U    α  A    when   for-all    β      α   subscript  V  β         subscript  U  α     U_{\alpha\in A}\qquad\mbox{when}\qquad\forall\beta\ \exists\alpha\ V_{\beta}%
 \subseteq U_{\alpha}   .  In other words, there is a refinement map     ϕ  :   B  →  A      normal-:  ϕ   normal-→  B  A     \phi:B\rightarrow A   satisfying     V  β   ⊆   U   ϕ   (  β  )          subscript  V  β    subscript  U    ϕ  β      V_{\beta}\subseteq U_{\phi(\beta)}   for every    β  ∈  B      β  B    \beta\in B   . This map is used, for instance, in the Čech cohomology of X. 1  Every subcover is also a refinement, but the opposite is not always true. A subcover is made from the sets that are in the cover, but omitting some of them; whereas a refinement is made from any sets that are subsets of the sets in the cover.  The refinement relation is a preorder on the set of covers of X .  Generally speaking, a refinement of a given structure is another that in some sense contains it. Examples are to be found when partitioning an interval (one refinement of $a_0 < a_1 < ... being a_0 < b_0 < a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n < b_1$ ), considering topologies (the standard topology in euclidean space being a refinement of the trivial topology ). When subdividing simplicial complexes (the first barycentric subdivision of a simplicial complex is a refinement), the situation is slightly different: every simplex in the finer complex is a face of some simplex in the coarser one, and both have equal underlying polyhedra.  Yet another notion of refinement is that of star refinement .  Compactness  The language of covers is often used to define several topological properties related to compactness . A topological space X is said to be   Compact , if every open cover has a finite subcover, (or equivalently that every open cover has a finite refinement);  Lindelöf , if every open cover has a countable subcover, (or equivalently that every open cover has a countable refinement);  Metacompact , if every open cover has a point finite open refinement;  Paracompact , if every open cover admits a locally finite open refinement.   For some more variations see the above articles.  Covering dimension  A topological space X is said to be of covering dimension  n if every open cover of X has a point finite open refinement such that no point of X is included in more than n+1 sets in the refinement and if n is the minimum value for which this is true. 2 If no such minimal n exists, the space is said to be of infinite covering dimension.
