Prüfer rank

In mathematics, especially in the area of algebra known as group theory, the Prüfer rank of a pro-p group measures the size of a group in terms of the ranks of its elementary abelian sections.1 The rank is well behaved and helps to define analytic pro-p-groups. The term is named after Heinz Prüfer.
Definition
The Prüfer rank of pro-p-group

 
  is








where 
 
 
 
  is the rank of the abelian group


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the Frattini subgroup of 
 
 
 
 .
As the Frattini subgroup of 
 
 
 
  can be thought of as the group of non-generating elements of 
 
 
 
 , it can be seen that 
 
 
 
 
  will be equal to the size of any minimal generating set of 
 
 
 
 .
Properties
Those profinite groups with finite Prüfer rank are more amenable to analysis.
Specifically in the case of finitely generated pro-p groups, having finite Prüfer rank is equivalent to having an open normal subgroup that is powerful. In turn these are precisely the class of pro-p groups that are p-adic analytic - that is groups that can be imbued with a p-adic manifold structure.
