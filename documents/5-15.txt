   Prüfer rank      Prüfer rank   In mathematics , especially in the area of algebra known as group theory , the Prüfer rank of a pro-p group measures the size of a group in terms of the ranks of its elementary abelian  sections . 1 The rank is well behaved and helps to define analytic pro-p-groups. The term is named after Heinz Prüfer .  Definition  The Prüfer rank of pro-p-group    G   G   G   is        sup   {   d   (  H  )    |   H  ≤  G   }      supremum   conditional-set    d  H     H  G      \sup\{d(H)|H\leq G\}        where    d   (  H  )       d  H    d(H)   is the rank of the abelian group       H  /  Φ    (  H  )         H  normal-Φ   H    H/\Phi(H)   ,  where    Φ   (  H  )       normal-Φ  H    \Phi(H)   is the Frattini subgroup of   H   H   H   .  As the Frattini subgroup of   H   H   H   can be thought of as the group of non-generating elements of   H   H   H   , it can be seen that    d   (  H  )       d  H    d(H)   will be equal to the size of any minimal generating set of   H   H   H   .  Properties  Those profinite groups with finite Prüfer rank are more amenable to analysis.  Specifically in the case of finitely generated pro-p groups , having finite Prüfer rank is equivalent to having an open  normal subgroup that is powerful . In turn these are precisely the class of pro-p groups that are p-adic analytic - that is groups that can be imbued with a p-adic  manifold structure.
