P  d   =    0.4  ⋅   P  2007   ⋅   19  20    +   0.6  ⋅   (    P    A  p   -  2008    +    P    C  l   -  2008    ⋅   19  18     )      ,       subscript  P  d      normal-⋅  0.4   subscript  P  2007     19  20     normal-⋅  0.6     subscript  P      A  p   2008     normal-⋅   subscript  P      C  l   2008      19  18         P_{d}=0.4\cdot\;P_{2007}\cdot\;{\frac{19}{20}}+0.6\cdot\left(\;P_{Ap-2008}+\;P%
 _{Cl-2008}\cdot\;{\frac{19}{18}}\right),      In the case of Rangers , Provincial Osorno , and Santiago Morning , the following formula was used since they were not in the Primera División in the 2007 season:         P  d   =    P    A  p   -  2008    +    P    C  l   -  2008    ⋅   19  18      .       subscript  P  d      subscript  P      A  p   2008     normal-⋅   subscript  P      C  l   2008      19  18       P_{d}=P_{Ap-2008}+P_{Cl-2008}\cdot\;{\frac{19}{18}}.      In both formulas, P d is the relegation average; P 2007 is the total points earned in the 2007 season; P Ap-2008 is the points earned in this season's Apertura tournament; P Cl-2008 is the points earned in this season's Clausura tournament.
