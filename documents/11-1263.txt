Gallate 1-beta-glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, a gallate 1-beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + gallate 
 
 
 
  UDP + 1-galloyl-beta-D-glucose
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and gallate, whereas its two products are UDP and 1-galloyl-beta-D-glucose.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:gallate beta-D-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include UDP-glucose-vanillate 1-glucosyltransferase, UDPglucose:vanillate 1-O-glucosyltransferase, and UDPglucose:gallate glucosyltransferase.
