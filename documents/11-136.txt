UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine—D-glutamate ligase




UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine—D-glutamate ligase

In enzymology, an UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine—D-glutamate ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine + D-glutamate 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamate
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine, and D-glutamate, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds as acid-D-amino-acid ligases (peptide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine:D-glutamate ligase (ADP-forming). Other names in common use include MurD synthetase, UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamate synthetase, uridine diphospho-N-acetylmuramoylalanyl-D-glutamate synthetase, D-glutamate-adding enzyme, D-glutamate ligase, UDP-Mur-NAC-L-Ala:D-Glu ligase, UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine:glutamate ligase (ADP-forming), and UDP-N-acetylmuramoylalanine-D-glutamate ligase. This enzyme participates in d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism and peptidoglycan biosynthesis.
