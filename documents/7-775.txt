Lee Hwa Chung theorem

The Lee Hwa Chung theorem is a theorem in symplectic topology.
The statement is as follows. Let M be a symplectic manifold with symplectic form Ï‰. Let 
 
 
 
  be a differential k-form on M which is invariant for all Hamiltonian vector fields. Then:
:*If k is odd, 
 
 

:*If k is even, 
 
 
 
 , where
