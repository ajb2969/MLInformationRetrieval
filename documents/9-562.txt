   495 (number)      495 (number)   495 is the integer after 494 and before 496 . It is a pentatope number (and so a binomial coefficient     (      12      4      )     binomial  12  4    {\textstyle\left({{12}\atop{4}}\right)}   ).  Kaprekar transformation  The Kaprekar transformation is defined as follows for three-digit numbers:   Start with a three-digit number with at least two digits different.  Arrange the digits in ascending and then in descending order to get two three-digit numbers, adding leading zeros if necessary.  Subtract the smaller number from the bigger number.  Go back to step 2.   Repeating this process will always reach 495 in a few steps. Once 495 is reached, the process stops because 954 – 459 = 495.  Example  For example, choose 589:   985 − 589 = 396  963 − 369 = 594  954 − 459 = 495    The only three-digit numbers for which this function does not work are repdigits such as 111, which give the answer 0 after a single iteration. All other three-digits numbers work if leading zeros are used to keep the number of digits at 3:   211 – 112 = 099  990 – 099 = 891 (rather than 99 - 99 = 0)  981 – 189 = 792  972 – 279 = 693  963 – 369 = 594  954 − 459 = 495    The number 6174 has the same property for the four-digit numbers.
