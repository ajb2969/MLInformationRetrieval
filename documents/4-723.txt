   Consequent      Consequent   A consequent is the second half of a hypothetical proposition . In the standard form of such a proposition, it is the part that follows "then". In an implication , if   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   implies   ψ   ψ   \psi   then   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is called the antecedent and   ψ   ψ   \psi   is called the consequent . 1  Examples:   If P, then Q.   Q is the consequent of this hypothetical proposition.   If X is a mammal, then X is an animal.   Here, "X is an animal" is the consequent.   If computers can think, then they are alive.   "They are alive" is the consequent.  The consequent in a hypothetical proposition is not necessarily a consequence of the antecedent.   If monkeys are purple, then fish speak Klingon.   "Fish speak Klingon" is the consequent here, but intuitively is not a consequence of (nor does it have anything to do with) the claim made in the antecedent that "monkeys are purple".
