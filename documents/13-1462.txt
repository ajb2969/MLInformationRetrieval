   Yang–Mills–Higgs equations      Yang–Mills–Higgs equations   In mathematics, the Yang–Mills–Higgs equations are a set of non-linear partial differential equations for a Yang–Mills field , given by a connection, and a Higgs field , given by a section of a vector bundle . These equations are          D  A   *   F  A    +   [  Φ  ,    D  A   Φ   ]    =  0   ,           subscript  D  A    subscript  F  A     normal-Φ     subscript  D  A   normal-Φ     0    D_{A}*F_{A}+[\Phi,D_{A}\Phi]=0,            D  A   *   D  A    Φ   =  0           subscript  D  A    subscript  D  A    normal-Φ   0    D_{A}*D_{A}\Phi=0   with a boundary condition        lim    |  x  |   →  ∞      |  Φ  |    (  x  )     =  1.        subscript    normal-→    x          normal-Φ   x    1.    \lim_{|x|\rightarrow\infty}|\Phi|(x)=1.     These equations are named after Chen Ning Yang , Robert Mills , and Peter Higgs .  References     "  Category:Partial differential equations
