   2-deoxyglucosidase      2-deoxyglucosidase   In enzymology , a 2-deoxyglucosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a 2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucoside + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-deoxy-D-glucose + an alcohol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucoside and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 2-deoxy-D-glucose and alcohol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucoside deoxyglucohydrolase . Other names in common use include 2-deoxy-alpha-glucosidase , and 2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucosidase .
