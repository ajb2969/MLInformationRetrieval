   Kelvin transform      Kelvin transform    ''This article is about a type of transform used in classical potential theory , a topic in mathematics . ''   The Kelvin transform is a device used in classical potential theory to extend the concept of a harmonic function , by allowing the definition of a function which is 'harmonic at infinity'. This technique is also used in the study of subharmonic and superharmonic functions.  In order to define the Kelvin transform f * of a function f , it is necessary to first consider the concept of inversion in a sphere in R n as follows.  It is possible to use inversion in any sphere, but the ideas are clearest when considering a sphere with centre at the origin.  Given a fixed sphere S (0, R ) with centre 0 and radius R , the inversion of a point x in R n is defined to be          x  *   =     R  2     |  x  |   2    x    .       superscript  x         superscript  R  2    superscript    x   2    x     x^{*}=\frac{R^{2}}{|x|^{2}}x.        A useful effect of this inversion is that the origin 0 is the image of   ∞     \infty   , and   ∞     \infty   is the image of 0. Under this inversion, spheres are transformed into spheres, and the exterior of a sphere is transformed to the interior, and vice versa.  The Kelvin transform of a function is then defined by:  If D is an open subset of R n which does not contain 0, then for any function f defined on D , the Kelvin transform f * of f with respect to the sphere S (0, R ) is         f  *    (   x  *   )    =      |  x  |    n  -  2     R    2  n   -  4     f   (  x  )    =    1    |   x  *   |    n  -  2     f   (  x  )    =    1    |   x  *   |    n  -  2     f   (     R  2     |   x  *   |   2     x  *    )     .           superscript  f     superscript  x          superscript    x     n  2     superscript  R      2  n   4     f  x            1   superscript     superscript  x       n  2     f  x            1   superscript     superscript  x       n  2     f       superscript  R  2    superscript     superscript  x     2     superscript  x         f^{*}(x^{*})=\frac{|x|^{n-2}}{R^{2n-4}}f(x)=\frac{1}{|x^{*}|^{n-2}}f(x)=\frac{%
 1}{|x^{*}|^{n-2}}f\left(\frac{R^{2}}{|x^{*}|^{2}}x^{*}\right).     One of the important properties of the Kelvin transform, and the main reason behind its creation, is the following result:   Let D be an open subset in R n which does not contain the origin 0. Then a function u is harmonic, subharmonic or superharmonic in D if and only if the Kelvin transform u * with respect to the sphere S (0, R ) is harmonic, subharmonic or superharmonic in D * .   This follows from the formula        Δ   u  *    (   x  *   )    =     R  4     |   x  *   |    n  +  2      (   Δ  u   )    (     R  2     |   x  *   |   2     x  *    )     .        normal-Δ   superscript  u     superscript  x          superscript  R  4    superscript     superscript  x       n  2       normal-Δ  u        superscript  R  2    superscript     superscript  x     2     superscript  x        \Delta u^{*}(x^{*})=\frac{R^{4}}{|x^{*}|^{n+2}}(\Delta u)\left(\frac{R^{2}}{|x%
 ^{*}|^{2}}x^{*}\right).     See also   William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin  Inversive geometry   References           "  Category:Harmonic functions  Category:Transforms  Category:William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin
