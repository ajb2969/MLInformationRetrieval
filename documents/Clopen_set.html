<h1>Clopen set</h1>
<hr/>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>A <a href="graph_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">graph</a> with several clopen sets. Each of the three large pieces (i.e. <a href="connected_component_(topology)" title="wikilink">components</a>) is a clopen set, as is the union of any two or all three.</figcaption>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a>, a <strong>clopen set</strong> (a <a class="uri" href="portmanteau" title="wikilink">portmanteau</a> of <strong>closed-open set</strong>) in a <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a> is a set which is both <a href="open_set" title="wikilink">open</a> and <a href="closed_set" title="wikilink">closed</a>. That this is possible may seem counter-intuitive, as the common meanings of <em>open</em> and <em>closed</em> are antonyms. But their mathematical definitions are not <a href="mutually_exclusive" title="wikilink">mutually exclusive</a>. A set is closed if its <a href="Complement_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">complement</a> is open, which leaves the possibility of an open set whose complement is itself also open, making both sets both open <em>and</em> closed, and therefore clopen.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>In any topological space <em>X</em>, the <a href="empty_set" title="wikilink">empty set</a> and the whole space <em>X</em> are both clopen.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Now consider the space <em>X</em> which consists of the union of the two open <a href="interval_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">intervals</a> (0,1) and (2,3) of <strong>R</strong>. The topology on <em>X</em> is inherited as the <a href="topological_subspace" title="wikilink">subspace topology</a> from the ordinary topology on the <a href="real_line" title="wikilink">real line</a> <strong>R</strong>. In <em>X</em>, the set (0,1) is clopen, as is the set (2,3). This is a quite typical example: whenever a space is made up of a finite number of disjoint <a href="connected_space" title="wikilink">connected components</a> in this way, the components will be clopen.</p>

<p>As a less trivial example, consider the space <strong>Q</strong> of all <a href="rational_number" title="wikilink">rational numbers</a> with their ordinary topology, and the set <em>A</em> of all positive rational numbers whose square is bigger than 2. Using the fact that

 is not in <strong>Q</strong>, one can show quite easily that <em>A</em> is a clopen subset of <strong>Q</strong>. (Note also that <em>A</em> is <em>not</em> a clopen subset of the real line <strong>R</strong>; it is neither open nor closed in <strong>R</strong>.)</p>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<ul>
<li>A topological space <em>X</em> is <a href="connected_space" title="wikilink">connected</a> if and only if the only clopen sets are the empty set and <em>X</em>.</li>
<li>A set is clopen if and only if its <a href="boundary_(topology)" title="wikilink">boundary</a> is empty.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li>Any clopen set is a union of (possibly infinitely many) <a href="Connected_space" title="wikilink">connected components</a>.</li>
<li>If all connected components of <em>X</em> are open (for instance, if <em>X</em> has only finitely many components, or if <em>X</em> is <a href="locally_connected" title="wikilink">locally connected</a>), then a set is clopen in <em>X</em> if and only if it is a union of connected components.</li>
<li>A topological space <em>X</em> is <a href="discrete_space" title="wikilink">discrete</a> if and only if all of its subsets are clopen.</li>
<li>Using the <a href="union_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">union</a> and <a href="intersection_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">intersection</a> as operations, the clopen subsets of a given topological space <em>X</em> form a <a href="Boolean_algebra_(structure)" title="wikilink">Boolean algebra</a>. <em>Every</em> Boolean algebra can be obtained in this way from a suitable topological space: see <a href="Stone's_representation_theorem_for_Boolean_algebras" title="wikilink">Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras</a>.</li>
