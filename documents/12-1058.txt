Kolmogorov's criterion

In probability theory, Kolmogorov's criterion, named after Andrey Kolmogorov, is a theorem giving a necessary and sufficient condition for a Markov chain or continuous-time Markov chain to be stochastically identical to its time-reversed version.
Discrete-time Markov chains
The theorem states that a Markov chain with transition matrix P is reversible if and only if its transition probabilities satisfy1



for all finite sequences of states



Here pij are components of the transition matrix P, and S is the state space of the chain.
Example
(Figure)
Kolmogorov criterion dtmc.svg

Consider this figure depicting a section of a Markov chain with states i, j, k and l and the corresponding transition probabilities. Here Kolmogorov's criterion implies that the product of probabilities when traversing through any closed loop must be equal, so the product around the loop i to j to l to k returning to i must be equal to the loop the other way round,



Continuous-time Markov chains
The theorem states that a continuous-time Markov chain with transition rate matrix Q is reversible if and only if its transition probabilities satisfy2



for all finite sequences of states
