   Material nonimplication      Material nonimplication    Material nonimplication or abjunction ( latin  ab = "from", junctio =–"joining") is the negation of material implication . That is to say that for any two propositions P and Q, the material nonimplication from P to Q is true if and only if P does not imply Q.  It may be written using logical notation as:    p⊅q   Lpq   p↛q      Definition  Truth table       p   q      ↛   normal-↛   ~{}\nrightarrow        T   T   F     T   F   T     F   T   F     F   F   F     Properties  falsehood-preserving : The interpretation under which all variables are assigned a truth value of "false" produces a truth value of "false" as a result of material nonimplication.  Symbol  The symbol for material nonimplication is simply a crossed-out material implication symbol. Its Unicode symbol is 8603 (decimal).
