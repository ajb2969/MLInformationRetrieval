   Krogh length      Krogh length   The Krogh Length ,    λ  K     subscript  λ  K    \lambda_{K}   , is the distance between capillaries at which nutrients diffuse to based on cellular consumption of the nutrients. 1 2  It can be described as:       λ  K   =      D  s    c  o    /  R         subscript  λ  K          subscript  D  s    subscript  c  o    R      \lambda_{K}=\sqrt{D_{s}c_{o}/R}     where    D  s     subscript  D  s    D_{s}   is the diffusion constant of the solute in the substrate,    c  o     subscript  c  o    c_{o}   is the concentration in the channel, and   R   R   R   is the consumption by the cells. Units are in terms of length .
