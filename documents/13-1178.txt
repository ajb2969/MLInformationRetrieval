Krogh length




Krogh length

The Krogh Length, 
 
 
 
 , is the distance between capillaries at which nutrients diffuse to based on cellular consumption of the nutrients.12
It can be described as:



where 
 
 
 
  is the diffusion constant of the solute in the substrate, 
 
 
 
  is the concentration in the channel, and 
 
 
 
  is the consumption by the cells. Units are in terms of length.
