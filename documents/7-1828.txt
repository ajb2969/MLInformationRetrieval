Hermite's identity

In mathematics, Hermite's identity, named after Charles Hermite, gives the value of a summation involving the floor function. It states that for every real number x and for every positive integer n the following identity holds:12



Proof
Split 
 
 
 
  into its integer part and fractional part, 
 
 
 
 . There is exactly one 
 
 
 
  with


 
  By subtracting the same integer 
 
 
 
  from inside the floor operations on the left and right sides of this inequality, it may be rewritten as


 
  Therefore,


 
  and multiplying both sides by 
 
 
 
  gives


 
 , it becomes
$$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\left\lfloor x+\frac{k}{n}\right\rfloor
 =\sum_{k=0}^{k'-1} \lfloor x\rfloor+\sum_{k=k'}^{n-1} (\lfloor x\rfloor+1)=n\, \lfloor x\rfloor+n-k'
 =n\, \lfloor x\rfloor+\lfloor n\,\{x\}\rfloor=\left\lfloor n\, \lfloor x\rfloor+n\, \{x\} \right\rfloor=\lfloor nx\rfloor.$$
