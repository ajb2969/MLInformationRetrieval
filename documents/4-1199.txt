   Lamé's special quartic      Lamé's special quartic    Lamé's special quartic is the graph of the equation        x  4   +   y  4    =   r  4          superscript  x  4    superscript  y  4     superscript  r  4     x^{4}+y^{4}=r^{4}     where    r  >  0      r  0    r>0   . 1 It looks like a rounded square with "sides" of length    2  r      2  r    2r   and centered on the origin. This curve is a squircle centered on the origin, and it is a special case of a super ellipse . 2  Because of Pierre de Fermat 's only surviving proof, that of the n = 4 case of Fermat's Last Theorem , if r is rational there is no non-trivial rational point ( x , y ) on this curve (that is, no point for which both x and y are non-zero).
