   Prouhet–Thue–Morse constant      Prouhet–Thue–Morse constant   In mathematics , the Prouhet–Thue–Morse constant , named for Eugène Prouhet , Axel Thue , and Marston Morse , is the number—denoted by   τ   τ   \tau   —whose binary expansion .01101001100101101001011001101001... is given by the Thue–Morse sequence . That is,      τ  =    ∑   i  =  0   ∞     t  i    2   i  +  1      =   0.412454033640  …         τ    superscript   subscript     i  0         subscript  t  i    superscript  2    i  1             0.412454033640  normal-…      \tau=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{t_{i}}{2^{i+1}}=0.412454033640\ldots     where    t  i     subscript  t  i    t_{i}   is the i th element of the Prouhet–Thue–Morse sequence.  The generating series for the    t  i     subscript  t  i    t_{i}   is given by       τ   (  x  )    =    ∑   i  =  0   ∞       (   -  1   )    t  i      x  i     =    1   1  -  x    -   2    ∑   i  =  0   ∞      t  i     x  i               τ  x     superscript   subscript     i  0         superscript    1    subscript  t  i     superscript  x  i              1    1  x      2    superscript   subscript     i  0         subscript  t  i    superscript  x  i          \tau(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{t_{i}}\,x^{i}=\frac{1}{1-x}-2\sum_{i=0}^{%
 \infty}t_{i}\,x^{i}   and can be expressed as        τ   (  x  )    =    ∏   n  =  0   ∞    (   1  -   x   2  n     )     .        τ  x     superscript   subscript  product    n  0        1   superscript  x   superscript  2  n        \tau(x)=\prod_{n=0}^{\infty}(1-x^{2^{n}}).   This is the product of Frobenius polynomials , and thus generalizes to arbitrary fields .  The Prouhet–Thue–Morse constant was shown to be transcendental by Kurt Mahler in 1929. 1  Notes    References    .
