   Citramalate CoA-transferase      Citramalate CoA-transferase   In enzymology , a citramalate CoA-transferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + citramalate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetate + (3S)-citramalyl-CoA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and citramalate , whereas its two products are acetate and (3S)-citramalyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the CoA-transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:citramalate CoA-transferase . This enzyme participates in c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.8.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
