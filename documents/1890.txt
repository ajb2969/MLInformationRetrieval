   Kenneth L. Clarkson      Kenneth L. Clarkson    Kenneth Lee Clarkson is an American computer scientist known for his research in computational geometry . He is a researcher at the IBM Almaden Research Center , and co-editor-in-chief of the Journal of Computational Geometry . 1  Biography  Clarkson received his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1984, under the supervision of Andrew Yao . 2 Until 2007 he worked for Bell Labs . 3  In 1998 he was co-chair of the ACM  Symposium on Computational Geometry .  Research  Clarkson's primary research interests are in computational geometry .  His most highly cited paper, with Peter Shor , uses random sampling to devise optimal randomized algorithms for several problems of constructing geometric structures, following up on an earlier singly-authored paper by Clarkson on the same subject. 4 5 It includes algorithms for finding all   k   k   k   intersections among a set of   n   n   n    line segments in the plane in expected time    O   (   k  +   n   log  n     )       O    k    n    n       O(k+n\log n)   , finding the diameter of a set of   n   n   n   points in three dimensions in expected time    O   (   n   log  n    )       O    n    n      O(n\log n)   , and constructing the convex hull of   n   n   n   points in   d   d   d   -dimensional Euclidean space in expected time    O   (    n   ⌊   d  /  2   ⌋    +   n   log  n     )       O     superscript  n      d  2       n    n       O(n^{\lfloor d/2\rfloor}+n\log n)   . The same paper also uses random sampling to prove bounds in discrete geometry , and in particular to give tight bounds on the number of ≤ k -sets .  Clarkson has also written highly cited papers on the complexity of arrangements of curves and surfaces, 6  nearest neighbor search , 7 8  motion planning , 9 and low-dimensional linear programming and LP-type problems . 10  Awards and honors  In 2008 Clarkson was elected a Fellow of the ACM for his "contributions to computational geometry." 11  References  External links   Clarkson's web page at IBM   "  Category:Year of birth missing (living people)  Category:Living people  Category:Researchers in geometric algorithms  Category:Stanford University alumni  Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery     Editorial team , Journal of Computational Geometry.
