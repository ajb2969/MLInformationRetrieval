   Chaplygin's equation      Chaplygin's equation   In mathematics , Chaplygin's equation , named after Sergei Alekseevich Chaplygin , is a partial differential equation useful in the study of transonic  flow . 1 It is        f   θ  θ    +     v  2    1  -    v  2    c  2       f   v  v     +   v   f  v     =  0.         subscript  f    θ  θ         superscript  v  2     1     superscript  v  2    superscript  c  2       subscript  f    v  v       v   subscript  f  v     0.    f_{\theta\theta}+\frac{v^{2}}{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}f_{vv}+vf_{v}=0.     Here,    c  =   c   (  v  )        c    c  v     c=c(v)   is the speed of sound , determined by the equation of state of the fluid and Bernoulli's principle .
