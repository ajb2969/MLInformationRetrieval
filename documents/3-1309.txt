Ramification group

In number theory, more specifically in local class field theory, the ramification groups are a filtration of the Galois group of a local field extension, which gives detailed information on the ramification phenomena of the extension.
Ramification groups in lower numbering
Ramification groups are a refinement of the Galois group 
 
 
 
  of a finite 
 
 
Galois extension of local fields. We shall write 
 
 
 
  for the valuation, the ring of integers and its maximal ideal for 
 
 
 
 . As a consequence of Hensel's lemma, one can write 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the ring of integers of 
 
 
 
 .1 (This is stronger than the primitive element theorem.) Then, for each integer 
 
 
 
 , we define 
 
 
 
  to be the set of all 
 
 
 
  that satisfies the following equivalent conditions.

(i) 
 
 
 
  operates trivially on 
 
 

(ii) 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 

(iii) 
 
 


The group 
 
 
 
  is called 

 
 -th ramification group. They form a decreasing filtration,


 
  In fact, the 
 
 
 
  are normal by (i) and trivial for sufficiently large 
 
 
 
  by (iii). For the lowest indices, it is customary to call 
 
 
 
  the inertia subgroup of 
 
 
 
  because of its relation to splitting of prime ideals, while 
 
 
 
  the wild inertia subgroup of 
 
 
 
 . The quotient 
 
 
 
  is called the tame quotient.
The Galois group 
 
 
 
  and its subgroups 
 
 
 
  are studied by employing the above filtration or, more specifically, the corresponding quotients. In particular,



 
  where 
 
 
 
  are the (finite) residue fields of

  is unramified.


 
  is tamely ramified (i.e., the ramification index is prime to the residue characteristic.)

The study of ramification groups reduces to the totally ramified case since one has 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
One also defines the function 
 
 
 
 . (ii) in the above shows 
 
 
 
  is independent of choice of 
 
 
 
  and, moreover, the study of the filtration 
 
 
 
  is essentially equivalent to that of

  satisfies the following: for 
 
 
 
 ,











Fix a uniformizer 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  induces the injection 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 . (The map actually does not depend on the choice of the uniformizer.4) It follows from this5

  is a product of cyclic groups of order 
 
 
 
 .

In particular, 
 
 
 
  is a p-group and 
 
 
 
  is solvable.
The ramification groups can be used to compute the different

 
  of the extension 
 
 
 
  and that of subextensions:6



If 
 
 
 
  is a normal subgroup of 
 
 
 
 , then, for 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .7
Combining this with the above one obtains: for a subextension 
 
 
 
  corresponding to 
 
 
 
 ,



If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .8 In the terminology of Lazard, this can be understood to mean the Lie algebra

 
  is abelian.
Example
Let K be generated by x1=
 
 
 
 . The conjugates of x1 are x2=
 
 
 
 , x3= - x1, x4= - x2.
A little computation shows that the quotient of any two of these is a unit. Hence they all generate the same ideal; call it 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  generates 
 
 
2; (2)=
 
 
4.
Now x1-x3=2x1, which is in 
 
 
5.
and x1-x2=
 
 
 
 , which is in 
 
 
3.
Various methods show that the Galois group of K is 
 
 
 
 , cyclic of order 4. Also:


 
 =
 
 
 
 =
 
 
 
 =
 
 
 
 .
and 
 
 
 
 =
 
 
 
 =(13)(24).


 
  = 3+3+3+1+1 = 11. so that the different 
 
 
 
 =
 
 
11.
x1 satisfies x4-4x2+2, which has discriminant 2048=211.
Ramification groups in upper numbering
If 
 
 
 
  is a real number 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  denote 
 
 
 
  where i the least integer 
 
 
 
 . In other words, 
 
 
 
  Define 
 
 
 
  by9


 
  where, by convention, 
 
 
 
  is equal to 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  and is equal to 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 .10 Then 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 . It is immediate that 
 
 
 
  is continuous and strictly increasing, and thus has the continuous inverse function 
 
 
 
  defined on 
 
 
 
 . Define 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is then called the v-th ramification group in upper numbering. In other words, 
 
 
 
 . Note 
 
 
 
 . The upper numbering is defined so as to be compatible with passage to quotients:11 if 
 
 
 
  is normal in 
 
 
 
 , then


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  (whereas lower numbering is compatible with passage to subgroups.)
Herbrand's theorem states that the ramification groups in the lower numbering satisfy 
 
 
 
  (for 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the subextension corresponding to 
 
 
 
 ), and that the ramification groups in the upper numbering satisfy 
 
 
 
 .1213 This allows one to define ramification groups in the upper numbering for infinite Galois extensions (such as the absolute Galois group of a local field) from the inverse system of ramification groups for finite subextensions.
The upper numbering for an abelian extension is important because of the Hasseâ€“Arf theorem. It states that if 
 
 
 
  is abelian, then the jumps in the filtration 
 
 
 
  are integers; i.e., 
 
 
 
  whenever 
 
 
 
  is not an integer.14
The upper numbering is compatible with the filtration of the norm residue group by the unit groups under the Artin isomorphism. The image of 
 
 
 
  under the isomorphism



is just15
