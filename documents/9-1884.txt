Limits of integration

In calculus and mathematical analysis the limits of integration of the integral


 
  of a Riemann integrable function f defined on a closed and bounded [interval] are the real numbers a and b.
Improper integrals
Limits of integration can also be defined for improper integrals, with the limits of integration of both


 
  and


 
  again being a and b. For an improper integral


 
  or


 
  the limits of integration are a and ∞, or −∞ and b, respectively.
