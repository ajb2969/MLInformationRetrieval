Flavonol 3-O-glucosyltransferase




Flavonol 3-O-glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, a flavonol 3-O-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + a flavonol 
 
 
 
  UDP + a flavonol 3-O-beta-D-glucoside
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and flavonol, whereas its two products are UDP and flavonol 3-O-beta-D-glucoside.
This enzyme participates in flavonoid biosynthesis.
It is an enzyme found in grape (Vitis vinifera).1
Nomenclature
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:flavonol 3-O-D-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include:

GTI''',
uridine diphosphoglucose-flavonol 3-O-glucosyltransferase,
UDP-glucose:flavonol 3-O-glucosyltransferase, and
UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT).

Among those, UFGT is divided into UDP-glucose: Flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UF3GT) and UDP-glucose: Flavonoid 5-O-glucosyltransferase (UF5GT), which are responsible for the glucosylation of anthocyanins to produce stable molecules.2
