Neumann polynomial

In mathematics, a Neumann polynomial, introduced by Carl Neumann for the special case 
 
 
 
 , is a polynomial in 1/z used to expand functions in term of Bessel functions.1
The first few polynomials are















A general form for the polynomial is



they have the generating function


 
  where J are Bessel functions.

Examples
An example is the extension


 
  or the more general Sonine formula2


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is Gegenbauer's polynomial. Then,





 
  the confluent hypergeometric function


 
  and in particular


 
  the index shift formula


 
  the Taylor expansion (addition formula)
$$\frac{J_s\left(\sqrt{z^2-2uz}\right)}{\left(\sqrt{z^2-2uz}\right)^{\pm s}}= \sum_{k=0}\frac{(\pm u)^k}{k!}\frac{J_{s\pm k}(z)}{z^{\pm s}}$$ (cf.3) and the expansion of the integral of the Bessel function
$$\int J_s(z)dz= 2 \sum_{k=0} J_{s+2k+1}(z)$$ are of the same type.
