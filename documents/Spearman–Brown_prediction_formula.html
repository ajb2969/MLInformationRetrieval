<h1>Spearman–Brown prediction formula</h1>
<hr/>
<p>The <strong>Spearman–Brown prediction formula</strong>, also known as the <strong>Spearman–Brown prophecy formula</strong>, is a formula relating <a class="uri" href="psychometric" title="wikilink">psychometric</a> <a href="Reliability_(psychometric)" title="wikilink">reliability</a> to test length and used by psychometricians to predict the reliability of a test after changing the test length.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The method was published independently by <a href="Charles_Spearman" title="wikilink">Spearman</a> (1910) and <a href="William_Brown_(psychologist)" title="wikilink">Brown</a> (1910).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Predicted reliability, <span class="LaTeX">${\rho}^*_{xx'}$</span>, is estimated as:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$${\rho}^*_{xx'}=\frac{N{\rho}_{xx'}}{1+(N-1){\rho}_{xx'}}$$</span></p>
<p>where <em>n</em> is the number of "tests" combined (see below) and <span class="LaTeX">${\rho}_{xx'}$</span> is the reliability of the current "test". The formula predicts the reliability of a new test composed by replicating the current test <em>n</em> times (or, equivalently, creating a test with <em>n</em> parallel forms of the current exam). Thus <em>n</em> = 2 implies doubling the exam length by adding items with the same properties as those in the current exam. Values of <em>n</em> less than one may be used to predict the effect of shortening a test.</p>
<h2 id="forecasting-test-length">Forecasting test length</h2>
<p>The formula can also be rearranged to predict the number of replications required to achieve a degree of reliability:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$N=\frac{{\rho}^*_{xx'}(1-{\rho}_{xx'})}
{{\rho}_{xx'}(1-{\rho}^*_{xx'})}$$</span></p>
<h2 id="use-and-related-topics">Use and related topics</h2>
<p>This formula is commonly used by psychometricians to predict the reliability of a test after changing the test length. This relationship is particularly vital to the split-half and related methods of estimating reliability (where this method is sometimes known as the "Step Up" formula).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The formula is also helpful in understanding the nonlinear relationship between test reliability and test length. Test length must grow by increasingly larger values as the desired reliability approaches 1.0.</p>
<p>If the longer/shorter test is not parallel to the current test, then the prediction will not be strictly accurate. For example, if a highly reliable test was lengthened by adding many poor items then the achieved reliability will probably be much lower than that predicted by this formula.</p>
<p>For the reliability of a two-item test, the formula is more appropriate than <a href="Cronbach's_alpha" title="wikilink">Cronbach's alpha</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
