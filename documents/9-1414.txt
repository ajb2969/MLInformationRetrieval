Population vector

In neuroscience, a population vector is the sum of the preferred directions of a population of neurons, weighted by the respective spike counts.
The formula for computing the (normalized) population vector, 
 
 
 
 , takes the following form:



Where 
 
 
 
  is the activity of cell 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the preferred input for cell 
 
 
 
 .
Note that the vector 
 
 
 
 
  encodes the input direction, 
 
 
 
 , in terms of the activation of a population of neurons.
