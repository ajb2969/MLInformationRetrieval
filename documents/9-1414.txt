   Population vector      Population vector   In neuroscience , a population vector is the sum of the preferred directions of a population of neurons , weighted by the respective spike counts.  The formula for computing the (normalized) population vector,   F   F   F   , takes the following form:      F  =      ∑  j      m  j    F  j        ∑  j     m  j         F      subscript   j      subscript  m  j    subscript  F  j       subscript   j    subscript  m  j       F=\frac{\sum_{j}m_{j}F_{j}}{\sum_{j}m_{j}}     Where    m  j     subscript  m  j    m_{j}   is the activity of cell   j   j   j   , and    F  j     subscript  F  j    F_{j}   is the preferred input for cell   j   j   j   .  Note that the vector   F   F   F   encodes the input direction,    F  j     subscript  F  j    F_{j}   , in terms of the activation of a population of neurons.  "  Category:Neuroscience
