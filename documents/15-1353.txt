Geranyl diphosphate 2-C-methyltransferase

Geranyl diphosphate 2-C-methyltransferase (, SCO7701, GPP methyltransferase, GPPMT, 2-methyl-GPP synthase, MGPPS, geranyl pyrophosphate methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:geranyl-diphosphate 2-C-methyltransferase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + geranyl diphosphate

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + (E)-2-methylgeranyl diphosphate
 

This enzyme takes part in synthesis of 2-methylisoborneol.
