   Carotenoid 1,2-hydratase      Carotenoid 1,2-hydratase   Carotenoid 1,2-hydratase (, CrtC ) is an enzyme with system name lycopene hydro-lyase (1-hydroxy-1,2-dihydrolycopene-forming) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) 1-hydroxy-1,2-dihydrolycopene   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   lycopene + H 2 O  (2) 1,1'-dihydroxy-1,1',2,2'-tetrahydrolycopene   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-hydroxy-1,2-dihydrolycopene + H 2 O   In Rubrivivax gelatinosus and Thiocapsa roseopersicina both products are formed.
