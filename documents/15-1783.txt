   Conflict-Driven Clause Learning      Conflict-Driven Clause Learning   In computer science , Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) is an algorithm for solving the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Given a Boolean formula, the SAT problem asks for an assignment of variables so that the entire formula evaluates to true. The internal workings of CDCL SAT solvers were inspired by DPLL solvers .  Conflict-Driven Clause Learning was proposed by Marques-Silva and Sakallah (1996, 1 1999 2 ) and Bayardo and Schrag (1997 3 )  Background  Background knowledge about the following issues is needed to have a clear idea about the CDCL algorithm.  Boolean satisfiability problem  The satisfiability problem consists in finding a satisfying assignment for a given formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF).  An example of such a formula is:   ( ( not  A ) or (not C ) ) and ( B or C ),   or, using a common notation:       (    A  ′   +   C  ′    )    (   B  +  C   )          superscript  A  normal-′    superscript  C  normal-′      B  C     (A^{\prime}+C^{\prime})(B+C)   where A , B , C are Boolean variables,    A  ′     superscript  A  normal-′    A^{\prime}   ,    C  ′     superscript  C  normal-′    C^{\prime}   ,   B   B   B   , and   C   C   C   are literals, and     A  ′   +   C  ′        superscript  A  normal-′    superscript  C  normal-′     A^{\prime}+C^{\prime}   and    B  +  C      B  C    B+C   are clauses.  A satisfying assignment for this formula is e.g.:       A  =   F  a  l  s  e    ,    B  =   F  a  l  s  e    ,   C  =   T  r  u  e        formulae-sequence    A    F  a  l  s  e     formulae-sequence    B    F  a  l  s  e      C    T  r  u  e       A=False,B=False,C=True   since it makes the first clause true (since    A  ′     superscript  A  normal-′    A^{\prime}   is true) as well as the second one (since   C   C   C   is true).  This examples uses three variables ( A , B , C ), and there are two possible assignments (True and False) for each of them. So one has     2  3   =  8       superscript  2  3   8    2^{3}=8   possibilities. In this small example, one can use brute-force search to try all possible assignments and check if they satisfy the formula. But in realistic appilcations with millions of variables and clauses brute force search is impractical. The responsibility of a SAT solver is to find a satisfying assignment efficiently and quickly by applying different heuristics for complex CNF formulas.  Unit clause rule (unit propagation)  If an unsatisfied clause has all but one of its literals or variables evaluated at False, then the free literal must be True in order for the clause to be True. For example, if the below unsatisfied clause is evaluated with    A  =   F  a  l  s  e       A    F  a  l  s  e     A=False   and    B  =   F  a  l  s  e       B    F  a  l  s  e     B=False   we must have    C  =   T  r  u  e       C    T  r  u  e     C=True   in order for the clause    (   A  B  C   )      A  B  C    (ABC)   to be true.  Boolean constraint propagation (BCP)  The iterated application of the unit clause rule is referred to as unit propagation or Boolean constraint propagation (BCP).  Resolution  Consider two clauses    (   A  B  C   )      A  B  C    (ABC)   and    (   A  B  ¬  C   )      A  B   C    (AB\neg C)   . By applying resolution refutation we get    (   A  B   )      A  B    (AB)   , by cancelling out    ¬  C       C    \neg C   and   C   C   C   .  DP Algorithm  Davis, Putnam (1960) developed this algorithm. Some properties of this algorithms are:  ::::* Iteratively select variable for resolution till no more variable are left.  ::::* Can discard all original clauses after each iteration. See more details here DP Algorithm   DPLL Algorithm  Davis, Putnam, Logemann, Loveland (1962) had developed this algorithm. Some properties of this algorithms are:  ::::* It is based on search.  ::::* It is the basis for almost all modern SAT solvers.  ::::* It uses learning and chronological back tracking (1996). See more details here DPLL algorithm . An example with visualization of DPLL algorithm having chronological back tracking:  Image:Dpll1.png|All clauses making a CNF formula Image:Dpll2.png|Pick a variable Image:Dpll3.png|Make a decision, variable a = False (0), thus green clauses becomes True Image:Dpll4.png|After several decision making, we find an implication graph that leads to a conflict. Image:Dpll5.png|Now Backtrack to immediate level and by force assign opposite value to that variable Image:Dpll6.png|But force decision still lead to another conflict Image:Dpll7.png|Backtrack to previous level and make a force decision Image:Dpll8.png|Make a new decision, but it lead to a conflict Image:Dpll9.png|Make a forced decision, but again it lead to a conflict Image:Dpll10.png|Backtrack to previous level Image:Dpll11.png|Continue in this way and the final implication graph  CDCL (Conflict-Driven Clause Learning)  The main difference of CDCL and DPLL is that CDCL's back jumping is non-chronological.  Conflict-Driven Clause Learning works as follows.  ::::# Select a variable and assign True or False. This is called decision state. Remember the assignment.  ::::# Apply Boolean constraint propagation (Unit propagation).  ::::# Build the implication graph.  ::::# If there is any conflict then analyze the conflict and non-chronologically backtrack ("back jump") to the appropriate decision level.  ::::# Otherwise continue from step 1 until all variable values are assigned.  Example  A visual example of CDCL algorithm:  Image:Cdcl1.png| At first pick a branching variable, viz. x1 . A yellow circle means an arbitrary decision. Image:Cdcl2.png| Now apply unit propagation, which yields that x4 must be 1 (i.e. True). A gray circle means a forced variable assignment during unit propagation. The resulting graph is called implication graph . Image:Cdcl3.png| Arbitrarily pick another branching variable, x3 . Image:Cdcl4.png| Apply unit propagation and find the new implication graph. Image:Cdcl5.png| Here the variable x8 and x12 are forced to be 0 and 1, respectively. Image:Cdcl6.png| Pick another branching variable, x2 . Image:Cdcl7.png| Find implication graph. Image:Cdcl8.png|Pick another branching variable, x7 . Image:Cdcl9.png| Find implication graph. Image:Cdcl10.png| Found a conflict! Image:Cdcl11.png| Find the cut that lead to this conflict. From the cut, find a conflicting condition. Image:Cdcl12.png| Take the negation of this condition and make it a clause. Image:Cdcl13.png| Add the conflict clause to the problem. Image:Cdcl14.png| Non-chronological back jump to appropriate decision level. Image:Cdcl15.png| Back jump and set variable values accordingly.  Completeness  DPLL is a sound and complete algorithm for SAT. CDCL SAT solvers implement DPLL, but can learn new clauses and backtrack non-chronologically. Clause learning with conflict analysis does not affect soundness or completeness. Conflict analysis identifies new clauses using the resolution operation. Therefore each learnt clause can be inferred from the original clauses and other learnt clauses by a sequence of resolution steps. If cN is the new learnt clause, then ϕ is satisfiable if and only if ϕ ∪ {cN} is also satisfiable. Moreover, the modified backtracking step also does not affect soundness or completeness, since backtracking information is obtained from each new learnt clause.  Applications  The main application of CDCL algorithm is in different SAT solvers including:  ::::* MiniSAT  ::::* Zchaff SAT  ::::* Z3  ::::* ManySAT etc.  The CDCL algorithm has made SAT solvers so powerful that they are being used effectively in several real world application areas like AI planning, bioinformatics, software test pattern generation, software package dependencies, hardware and software model checking, and cryptography.  Related algorithms  Related algorithms to CDCL are the DP and DPLL algorithm described before. The DP algorithm uses resolution refutation and it has potential memory access problem. Whereas the DPLL algorithm is OK for randomly generated instances, it is bad for instances generated in practical applications. CDCL is a more powerful approach to solve such problems in that applying CDCL provides less state space search in comparison to DPLL.
