Spence's function

  In mathematics, Spence's function, or dilogarithm, denoted as Li2(z), is a particular case of the polylogarithm. Two related special functions are referred to as Spence's function, the dilogarithm itself:






\operatorname{Li}_2(z) = -\int_0^z{\ln(1-u) \over u}\, \mathrm{d}u \text{, }z \in\mathbb{C} \setminus [1,\infty)  and its reflection. For 
 
 
 
  an infinite series also applies (the integral definition constitutes its analytical extension to the complex plane):






\operatorname{Li}_2(z) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty {z^k \over k^2}. 
Alternatively, the dilogarithm function is sometimes defined as






\int_{1}^{v} \frac{ \ln t }{ 1 -t } \mathrm{d}t = \operatorname{Li}_2(1-v). 
In hyperbolic geometry the dilogarithm 
 
 
 
  occurs as the hyperbolic volume of an ideal simplex whose ideal vertices have cross ratio

 
 . Lobachevsky's function and Clausen's function are closely related functions.
William Spence, after whom the function was named by early writers in the field, was a Scottish mathematician working in the early nineteenth century.1 He was at school with John Galt,2 who later wrote a biographical essay on Spence.

In Particle Physics
Spence's Function is commonly encountered in particle physics while calculating radiative corrections. In this context, the function is often defined with an absolute value inside the logarithm:
