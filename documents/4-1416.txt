(Because of symmetry, all of the odd-order moments are zero.)  Making the substitution    x  =   R   cos   (  θ  )         x    R    θ      x=R\cos(\theta)   into the defining equation for the moment generating function it can be seen that:       M   (  t  )    =    2  π     ∫  0  π     e   R  t   cos   (  θ  )        sin  2    (  θ  )    d  θ           M  t       2  π     superscript   subscript   0   π      superscript  e    R  t    θ       superscript   2   θ   d  θ       M(t)=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}e^{Rt\cos(\theta)}\sin^{2}(\theta)\,d\theta     which can be solved (see Abramowitz and Stegun §9.6.18) to yield:       M   (  t  )    =    2      I  1    (   R  t   )     R  t           M  t     2       subscript  I  1     R  t      R  t       M(t)=2\,\frac{I_{1}(Rt)}{Rt}     where     I  1    (  z  )        subscript  I  1   z    I_{1}(z)   is the modified Bessel function . Similarly, the characteristic function is given by:       φ   (  t  )    =    2      J  1    (   R  t   )     R  t           φ  t     2       subscript  J  1     R  t      R  t       \varphi(t)=2\,\frac{J_{1}(Rt)}{Rt}     where     J  1    (  z  )        subscript  J  1   z    J_{1}(z)   is the Bessel function. (See Abramowitz and Stegun §9.1.20) , noting that the corresponding integral involving    sin   (   R  t   cos   (  θ  )     )         R  t    θ      \sin(Rt\cos(\theta))   is zero.)  In the limit of   R   R   R   approaching zero, the Wigner semicircle distribution becomes a Dirac delta function .

 }}{\pi r^{2}}\right\}     Relation to free probability  In free probability theory, the role of Wigner's semicircle distribution is analogous to that of the normal distribution in classical probability theory. Namely, in free probability theory, the role of cumulants is occupied by "free cumulants", whose relation to ordinary cumulants is simply that the role of the set of all partitions of a finite set in the theory of ordinary cumulants is replaced by the set of all noncrossing partitions of a finite set. Just as the cumulants of degree more than 2 of a probability distribution are all zero if and only if the distribution is normal, so also, the free cumulants of degree more than 2 of a probability distribution are all zero if and only if the distribution is Wigner's semicircle distribution.  See also   The W.s.d. is the limit of the Kesten–McKay distributions , as the parameter d tends to infinity.  In number-theoretic literature, the Wigner distribution is sometimes called the Sato–Tate distribution. See Sato–Tate conjecture .
