}} The Wigner semicircle distribution, named after the physicist Eugene Wigner, is the probability distribution supported on the interval [−R, R] the graph of whose probability density function f is a semicircle of radius R centered at (0, 0) and then suitably normalized (so that it is really a semi-ellipse):



for −R ≤ x ≤ R, and f(x) = 0 if R E(X^{2n})=\left({R \over 2}\right)^{2n} C_n\, 
where X is any random variable with this distribution and Cn is the nth Catalan number



so that the moments are the Catalan numbers if R = 2. (Because of symmetry, all of the odd-order moments are zero.)
Making the substitution 
 
 
 
  into the defining equation for the moment generating function it can be seen that:



which can be solved (see Abramowitz and Stegun §9.6.18) to yield:



where 
 
 
 
  is the modified Bessel function. Similarly, the characteristic function is given by:



where 
 
 
 
  is the Bessel function. (See Abramowitz and Stegun §9.1.20), noting that the corresponding integral involving 
 
 
 
  is zero.)
In the limit of 
 
 
 
  approaching zero, the Wigner semicircle distribution becomes a Dirac delta function.

Relation to free probability
In free probability theory, the role of Wigner's semicircle distribution is analogous to that of the normal distribution in classical probability theory. Namely, in free probability theory, the role of cumulants is occupied by "free cumulants", whose relation to ordinary cumulants is simply that the role of the set of all partitions of a finite set in the theory of ordinary cumulants is replaced by the set of all noncrossing partitions of a finite set. Just as the cumulants of degree more than 2 of a probability distribution are all zero if and only if the distribution is normal, so also, the free cumulants of degree more than 2 of a probability distribution are all zero if and only if the distribution is Wigner's semicircle distribution.

The W.s.d. is the limit of the Kesten–McKay distributions, as the parameter d tends to infinity.
In number-theoretic literature, the Wigner distribution is sometimes called the Sato–Tate distribution. See Sato–Tate conjecture.
