Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+)

  In enzymology, a glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

sn-glycerol 3-phosphate + NAD+

 
  glycerone phosphate + NADH + H+


The two substrates of this enzyme are sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are glycerone phosphate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sn-glycerol-3-phosphate:NAD+ 2-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include alpha-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+), alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+), glycerol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+), glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+), hydroglycerophosphate dehydrogenase, L-alpha-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, L-alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, L-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, L-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, NAD+-alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, NAD+-dependent glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, NAD+-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, NAD+-L-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, NAD+-linked glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADH-dihydroxyacetone phosphate reductase, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+). This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism.
