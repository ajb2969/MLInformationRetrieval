   Dagger category      Dagger category   In mathematics , a dagger category (also called involutive category or category with involution  1 2 ) is a category equipped with a certain structure called dagger or involution . The name dagger category was coined by Selinger. 3  Formal definition  A dagger category is a category    𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   equipped with an involutive  functor     †  :   𝒞   o  p    →  𝒞     fragments  normal-†  normal-:   superscript  𝒞    o  p    normal-→  C    \dagger\colon\mathcal{C}^{op}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}   that is the identity on objects, where    𝒞   o  p      superscript  𝒞    o  p     \mathcal{C}^{op}   is the opposite category .  In detail, this means that it associates to every morphism     f  :   A  →  B      normal-:  f   normal-→  A  B     f\colon A\to B   in   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   its adjoint      f  †   :   B  →  A      normal-:   superscript  f  normal-†    normal-→  B  A     f^{\dagger}\colon B\to A   such that for all    f  :   A  →  B      normal-:  f   normal-→  A  B     f\colon A\to B   and    g  :   B  →  C      normal-:  g   normal-→  B  C     g\colon B\to C   ,         id  A   =   id  A  †    :   A  →  A      normal-:     subscript  id  A    superscript   subscript  id  A   normal-†     normal-→  A  A     \mathrm{id}_{A}=\mathrm{id}_{A}^{\dagger}\colon A\rightarrow A            (   g  ∘  f   )   †   =    f  †   ∘   g  †     :   C  →  A      normal-:     superscript    g  f   normal-†      superscript  f  normal-†    superscript  g  normal-†      normal-→  C  A     (g\circ f)^{\dagger}=f^{\dagger}\circ g^{\dagger}\colon C\rightarrow A           f    †  †    =  f   :   A  →   B       normal-:     superscript  f   normal-†  absent  normal-†    f    normal-→  A  B     f^{\dagger\dagger}=f\colon A\rightarrow B\,      Note that in the previous definition, the term "adjoint" is used in a way analogous to (and inspired by) the linear-algebraic sense, not in the category-theoretic sense.  Some sources 4 define a category with involution to be a dagger category with the additional property that its set of morphisms is partially ordered and that the order of morphisms is compatible with the composition of morphisms, that is a a\circ c a , b , c whenever their sources and targets are compatible. Examples   The category  Rel of sets and relations possesses a dagger structure i.e. for a given relation     R  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  R   normal-→  X  Y     R:X\rightarrow Y   in Rel , the relation     R  †   :   Y  →  X      normal-:   superscript  R  normal-†    normal-→  Y  X     R^{\dagger}:Y\rightarrow X   is the relational converse of   R   R   R   . In this example, a self-adjoint morphism is a symmetric relation .    The category  Cob of cobordisms is a dagger compact category , in particular it possesses a dagger structure.    The category  FdHilb of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces also possesses a dagger structure: Given a linear map     f  :   A  →  B      normal-:  f   normal-→  A  B     f:A\rightarrow B   , the map     f  †   :   B  →  A      normal-:   superscript  f  normal-†    normal-→  B  A     f^{\dagger}:B\rightarrow A   is just its adjoint in the usual sense.    Any monoid with involution is a dagger category with only one object. In fact, every endomorphism  hom-set in a dagger category is not simply a monoid , but a monoid with involution, because of the dagger.    A discrete category is trivially a dagger category.    A groupoid (and as trivial corollary a group ) also has a dagger structure with the adjoint of a morphism being its inverse. In this case, all morphisms are unitary.   Remarkable morphisms  In a dagger category   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   , a morphism    f   f   f   is called   unitary if     f  †   =   f   -  1         superscript  f  normal-†    superscript  f    1      f^{\dagger}=f^{-1}   ;  self-adjoint if    f  =   f  †       f   superscript  f  normal-†     f=f^{\dagger}   (this is only possible for an endomorphism     f  :   A  →  A      normal-:  f   normal-→  A  A     f\colon A\to A   ).   The terms unitary and self-adjoint in the previous definition are taken from the category of Hilbert spaces where the morphisms satisfying those properties are then unitary and self-adjoint in the usual sense.
