   Perry Robertson formula      Perry Robertson formula   The Perry-Robertson formula is a mathematical formula which is able to produce a good approximation of buckling loads in long slender beams , and is the basis for the buckling formulation adopted in EN 1993 . The formula in question can be expressed in the following form:       σ  m   =    1  2    (     f  y   +    σ  e    (   1  +  θ   )     -      (    f  y   +    σ  e    (   1  +  θ   )     )   2   -   4   f  y    σ  e       )         subscript  σ  m       1  2        subscript  f  y      subscript  σ  e     1  θ          superscript     subscript  f  y      subscript  σ  e     1  θ     2     4   subscript  f  y    subscript  σ  e          \sigma_{m}=\frac{1}{2}\left(f_{y}+\sigma_{e}\left(1+\theta\right)-\sqrt{\left(%
