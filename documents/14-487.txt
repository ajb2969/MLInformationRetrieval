Perry Robertson formula

The Perry-Robertson formula is a mathematical formula which is able to produce a good approximation of buckling loads in long slender beams, and is the basis for the buckling formulation adopted in EN 1993. The formula in question can be expressed in the following form:



with 
 
 

where:



 
  is the average longitudinal stress in the beam's cross section


 
  is the material's elastic limit


 
  is the average tension measured in the cross section which correspond to the beam's Euler load


 
  the amplitude of the initial geometrical imperfection


 
  distance from the cross section's centroid to the section's most stressed fiber


 
  the section's radius of gyration

Robertson then proposed that 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  represents the beam's slenderness.
