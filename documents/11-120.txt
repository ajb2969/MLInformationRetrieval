   Ribose-5-phosphate—ammonia ligase      Ribose-5-phosphate—ammonia ligase   In enzymology , a ribose-5-phosphate-ammonia ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + ribose 5-phosphate + NH 3    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + 5-phosphoribosylamine   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , ribose 5-phosphate , and NH 3 , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and 5-phosphoribosylamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming generic carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ribose-5-phosphate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming) . Other names in common use include 5-phosphoribosylamine synthetase , ribose 5-phosphate aminotransferase , and ammonia-ribose 5-phosphate aminotransferase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 6.3.4  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
