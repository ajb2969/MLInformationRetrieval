Affine Hecke algebra

In mathematics, an affine Hecke algebra is the Hecke algebra of an affine Weyl group, and can be used to prove Macdonald's constant term conjecture for Macdonald polynomials.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a Euclidean space of a finite dimension and 
 
 
 
  an affine root system on 
 
 
 
 . An affine Hecke algebra is a certain associative algebra that deforms the group algebra

 
  of the Weyl group

 
  of 
 
 
 
  (the affine Weyl group). It is usually denoted by 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is multiplicity function that plays the role of deformation parameter. For 
 
 
 
  the affine Hecke algebra 
 
 
 
  indeed reduces to 
 
 
 
 .
Generalizations
Ivan Cherednik introduced generalizations of affine Hecke algebras, the so-called double affine Hecke algebra (usually referred to as DAHA). Using this he was able to give a proof of Macdonald's constant term conjecture for Macdonald polynomials (building on work of Eric Opdam). Another main inspiration for Cherednik to consider the double affine Hecke algebra was the quantum KZ equations.
