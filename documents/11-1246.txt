   Flavone 7-O-beta-glucosyltransferase      Flavone 7-O-beta-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a flavone 7-O-beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone $\rightleftharpoons$ UDP + 7-O-beta-D-glucosyl-5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone (luteolin), whereas its two products are UDP and 7-O-beta-D-glucosyl-5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone (cynaroside).  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone 7-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include UDP-glucose-apigenin beta-glucosyltransferase , UDP-glucose-luteolin beta-D-glucosyltransferase , uridine diphosphoglucose-luteolin glucosyltransferase , uridine diphosphoglucose-apigenin 7-O-glucosyltransferase , and UDP-glucosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in flavonoid biosynthesis .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure  Category:Flavones metabolism
