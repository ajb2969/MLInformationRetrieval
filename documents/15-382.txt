Sugeno integral

In mathematics, the Sugeno integral, named after M. Sugeno,1 is a type of integral with respect to a fuzzy measure.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a measurable space and let 
 
 
 
  be an 
 
 
 
 -measurable function.
The Sugeno integral over the crisp set

 
  of the function 
 
 
 
  with respect to the fuzzy measure 
 
 
 
  is defined by:






\int_A h(x) \circ g
{\sup_{E\subseteq X}} \left[\min\left(\min_{x\in E} h(x), g(A\cap E)\right)\right]
{\sup_{\alpha\in [0,1]}} \left[\min\left(\alpha, g(A\cap F_\alpha)\right)\right]  where 
 
 
 
 .
The Sugeno integral over the fuzzy set

 of the function 
 
 
 
  with respect to the fuzzy measure 
 
 
 
  is defined by:



where 
 
 
 
  is the membership function of the fuzzy set 
 
 
 
 .
