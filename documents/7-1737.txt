   Minakshisundaram–Pleijel zeta function      Minakshisundaram–Pleijel zeta function   The Minakshisundaram–Pleijel zeta function is a zeta function encoding the eigenvalues of the Laplacian of a compact Riemannian manifold. It was introduced by . The case of a compact region of the plane was treated earlier by .  Definition  For a compact Riemannian manifold M of dimension N with eigenvalues     λ  1   ,   λ  2   ,  …      subscript  λ  1    subscript  λ  2   normal-…    \lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},\ldots   of the Laplace–Beltrami operator Δ the zeta function is given for    Re   (  s  )      Re  s    \operatorname{Re}(s)   sufficiently large by        Z   (  s  )    =   Tr   (   Δ   -  s    )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     |   λ  n   |    -  s      .          Z  s    Tr   superscript  normal-Δ    s            superscript   subscript     n  1       superscript     subscript  λ  n      s        Z(s)=\operatorname{Tr}(\Delta^{-s})=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|\lambda_{n}|^{-s}.     (where if an eigenvalue is zero it is omitted in the sum). The manifold may have a boundary, in which case one has to prescribe suitable boundary conditions, such as Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions.  More generally one can define       Z   (  P  ,  Q  ,  s  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞      f  n    (  P  )    f  n    (  Q  )     λ  n  s           Z   P  Q  s      superscript   subscript     n  1           subscript  f  n   P   subscript  f  n   Q    superscript   subscript  λ  n   s       Z(P,Q,s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{f_{n}(P)f_{n}(Q)}{\lambda_{n}^{s}}     for P and Q on the manifold, where the f n are normalized eigenfunctions. This can be analytically continued to a meromorphic function of s for all complex s , and is holomorphic for P ≠ Q .  The only possible poles are simple poles at the points s = N /2, N /2−1, N /2−2,..., 1/2,−1/2, −3/2,... for N odd, and at the points s = N /2, N /2−1, N /2−2, ...,2, 1 for N even. If N is odd then Z ( P , P , s ) vanishes at s = 0, −1, −2,... If N is even its values can be explicitly by Wiener-Ikehara theorem as a corollary the relation       Z   (  P  ,  P  ,  s  )    ∼    T   N  /  2       (   2   π    )   N   Γ   (    N  /  2   +  1   )        similar-to    Z   P  P  s       superscript  T    N  2       superscript    2    π    N   normal-Γ      N  2   1       \displaystyle Z(P,P,s)\sim\frac{T^{N/2}}{(2\sqrt{\pi})^{N}\Gamma(N/2+1)}     where the sign ~ indicates that the quotient of both the sides tend to 1 when T tends to +∞.  The function Z ( s ) can be recovered from this by integrating Z ( P , P , s ) over the whole manifold M :       Z   (  s  )    =    ∫  M    Z   (  P  ,  P  ,  s  )   d  P          Z  s     subscript   M     Z   P  P  s   d  P      \displaystyle Z(s)=\int_{M}Z(P,P,s)dP     Heat kernel  The analytic continuation of the zeta function can be found by expressing it in terms of the heat kernel       K   (  P  ,  Q  ,  t  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     f  n    (  P  )    f  n    (  Q  )    e   -    λ  n   t             K   P  Q  t      superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  f  n   P   subscript  f  n   Q   superscript  e       subscript  λ  n   t         K(P,Q,t)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}f_{n}(P)f_{n}(Q)e^{-\lambda_{n}t}     as the Mellin transform       Z   (  P  ,  Q  ,  s  )    =    1   Γ   (  s  )       ∫  0  ∞    K   (  P  ,  Q  ,  t  )    t   s  -  1    d  t           Z   P  Q  s        1    normal-Γ  s      superscript   subscript   0       K   P  Q  t    superscript  t    s  1    d  t       Z(P,Q,s)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\int_{0}^{\infty}K(P,Q,t)t^{s-1}dt     In case of heat kernel, for given a Riemannian manifold (M,g) we can take the orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions and obtain the partition function        Z   (  s  )    =    ∑   i  =  1   ∞    e   -    λ  i   s       .        Z  s     subscript   superscript       i  1     superscript  e       subscript  λ  i   s        Z(s)=\sum^{\infty}_{i=1}e^{-\lambda_{i}s}.     The poles of the zeta function can be found from the asymptotic behavior of the heat kernel as t →0.  Example  If the manifold is a circle of dimension N =1, then the eigenvalues of the Laplacian are n 2 for integers n . The zeta function       Z   (  s  )    =    ∑   n  ≠  0     1    (   n  2   )   s     =   2  ζ   (   2  s   )            Z  s     subscript     n  0      1   superscript   superscript  n  2   s            2  ζ    2  s       Z(s)=\sum_{n\neq 0}\frac{1}{(n^{2})^{s}}=2\zeta(2s)   where ζ is the Riemann zeta function .  Applications  Apply the method of heat kernel to asymptotic expansion for Riemannian manifold (M,g) we obtain the two following theorems. Both are the resolutions of the inverse problem in which we get the geometric properties or quantities from spectra of the operators.  1,Minakshisundaram-Pleijel Asymptotic Expansion  Let (M,g) be an n -dimensional Riemannian manifold. The following asymptotic expansions hold as t →0+:        Z   (  s  )    ∼     (   4  π  s   )    -   n  /  2       ∑   m  =  0   ∞     a  m    s  m       .     similar-to    Z  s      superscript    4  π  s       n  2       subscript   superscript       m  0       subscript  a  m    superscript  s  m        Z(s)\sim(4\pi s)^{-n/2}\sum^{\infty}_{m=0}a_{m}s^{m}.   In dim=2, this means that the integral of scalar curvature tells us the Euler characteristic of M, i.e. Gauss-Bonnet Theorem .  In particular,        a  0   =   V  o  l   (  M  ,  g  )     ,    a  1   =    1  6     ∫  M    S   (  x  )   d  V         formulae-sequence     subscript  a  0     V  o  l   M  g        subscript  a  1       1  6     subscript   M     S  x  d  V        a_{0}=Vol(M,g),\ \ \ \ a_{1}=\frac{1}{6}\int_{M}S(x)dV   where S(x) is scalar curvature, the trace of the Ricci curvature , on M.  2,Weyl Asymptotic Formula Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold, with eigenvalues     0  =   λ  0   ≤   λ  1   ≤    λ  2   ⋯    ,        0   subscript  λ  0         subscript  λ  1           subscript  λ  2   normal-⋯      0=\lambda_{0}\leq\lambda_{1}\leq\lambda_{2}\cdots,   with each distinct eigenvalue repeated with its multiplicity. Define N(λ) to be the number of eigen values less than or equal to   λ   λ   \lambda   , and let    ω  n     subscript  ω  n    \omega_{n}   denote the volume of the unit disk in    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   . Then        N   (  λ  )    ∼     ω  n   V  o  l   (  M  )    λ   n  /  2       (   2  π   )   n     ,     similar-to    N  λ        subscript  ω  n   V  o  l  M   superscript  λ    n  2      superscript    2  π   n      N(\lambda)\sim\frac{\omega_{n}Vol(M)\lambda^{n/2}}{(2\pi)^{n}},   as λ→∞. Additionally, as k→∞,         (   λ  k   )    n  /  2    ∼      (   2  π   )   n   k     ω  n   V  o  l   (  M  )      .     similar-to   superscript   subscript  λ  k     n  2         superscript    2  π   n   k      subscript  ω  n   V  o  l  M      (\lambda_{k})^{n/2}\sim\frac{(2\pi)^{n}k}{\omega_{n}Vol(M)}.   This is also called Weyl's law , refined from Minakshisundaram-Pleijel asymptotic expansion.
