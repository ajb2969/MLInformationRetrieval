Usage
The Template:Infobox probability distribution generates a right-hand side infobox, based on the specified parameters. To use this template, copy the following code in your article and fill in as appropriate:
{{Infobox probability distribution

Parameters

name — Name at the top of the infobox; should be the name of the distribution without the word "distribution" in it, eg "Normal", "Exponential" (optional).
type — possible values are “discrete” (or “mass”), “continuous” (or “density”), and “multivariate”.
pdf_image — probability density image-spec plus other text, such as: [[Image:xxx.svg|250px]]text here (optional).
cdf_image — cumulative distribution image-spec plus other text, such as: [[Image:yyy.svg|250px]]text here. (optional).
notation — typical designation for this distribution, for example 
 
 
 
 . The notation should include all the distribution parameters explained in the next cell.
parameters — parameters of the distribution family (such as μ and σ2 for the normal distribution).
support — the support of the distribution, which may depend on the parameters. Specify this as  for continuous distributions, and as  for discrete distributions.
pdf — probability density function (or probability mass function), such as: . Please exclude the function label, such as “ƒ(x;μ,σ2)”.
cdf — cumulative distribution function, eg:  is the [[regularized incomplete beta function]].
quantile — quantile function (or inverse cumulative distribution function). If 
 
 
 
  is the CDF and 
 
 
 
  is the quantile function, then 
 
 

mean — the mean, or expected value.
median — the median, only for univariate distributions.
mode — the mode.
variance — variance of the distribution, or covariance matrix in multivariate case.
skewness — the skewness.
kurtosis — the kurtosis excess.
entropy — the information entropy.
mgf — the moment-generating function, for example: .
char or cf — the characteristic function, such as: .
pgf - the Probability-generating function.
fisher — the Fisher information matrix for the model.


intro — optional message which will be displayed before all other content in the infobox.
marginleft — margin space left of infobox (default: 1em).
box_width — width of the infobox (default: 325px).
