 }}  Parameters   name — Name at the top of the infobox; should be the name of the distribution without the word "distribution" in it, eg "Normal", "Exponential" (optional).  type — possible values are “discrete” (or “mass”), “continuous” (or “density”), and “multivariate”.  pdf_image — probability density image-spec plus other text, such as: [[Image:xxx.svg|250px]] text here (optional).  cdf_image — cumulative distribution image-spec plus other text, such as: [[Image:yyy.svg|250px]] text here. (optional).  notation — typical designation for this distribution, for example    𝒩   (  μ  ,   σ  2   )       𝒩   μ   superscript  σ  2      \scriptstyle\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^{2})   . The notation should include all the distribution parameters explained in the next cell.  parameters — parameters of the distribution family (such as μ and σ 2 for the normal distribution).  support — the support of the distribution, which may depend on the parameters. Specify this as x \in some set for continuous distributions, and as k \in some set for discrete distributions.  pdf — probability density function (or probability mass function), such as: \frac{\Gamma(r+k)}{k!\,\Gamma(r)}\,p^r\,(1-p)^k \! . Please exclude the function label, such as “ ƒ (x; μ , σ 2 )”.  cdf — cumulative distribution function, eg: I_p(r,k+1)\text{ where }I_p(x,y) is the [[regularized incomplete beta function]] .  quantile — quantile function (or inverse cumulative distribution function). If    F   (  )       F     F()   is the CDF and    Q   (  )       Q     Q()   is the quantile function, then     Q   (   F   (  x  )    )    =  x        Q    F  x    x    Q(F(x))=x     mean — the mean , or expected value .  median — the median , only for univariate distributions.  mode — the mode .  variance — variance of the distribution, or covariance matrix in multivariate case.  skewness — the skewness .  kurtosis — the kurtosis excess .  entropy — the information entropy .  mgf — the moment-generating function , for example: \left(\frac{p}{1-(1-p) e^t}\right)^r \! .  char or cf — the characteristic function , such as: \left(\frac{p}{1-(1-p) e^{i\,t}}\right)^r \! .  pgf - the Probability-generating function .  fisher — the Fisher information matrix for the model.    intro — optional message which will be displayed before all other content in the infobox.  marginleft — margin space left of infobox (default: 1em).  box_width — width of the infobox (default: 325px).
