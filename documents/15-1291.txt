TRNASer (uridine44-2'-O)-methyltransferase

TRNASer (uridine44-2'-O)-methyltransferase (, TRM44) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNASer (uridine44-2'-O)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + uridine44 in tRNASer

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methyluridine44 in tRNASer
 

The 2'-O-methylation of uridine44 contributes to stability of tRNASer(CGA).
