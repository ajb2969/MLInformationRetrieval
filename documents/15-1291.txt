   TRNASer (uridine44-2'-O)-methyltransferase      TRNASer (uridine44-2'-O)-methyltransferase   TRNASer (uridine 44 -2'-O)-methyltransferase (, TRM 44 ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNASer (uridine 44 -2'-O)-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + uridine 44 in tRNASer    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methyluridine 44 in tRNASer   The 2'-O-methylation of uridine 44 contributes to stability of tRNASer(CGA).
