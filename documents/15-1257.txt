   23S rRNA (guanine748-N1)-methyltransferase      23S rRNA (guanine748-N1)-methyltransferase   23S rRNA (guanine 748 -N 1 )-methyltransferase (, Rlma(II) , Rlma2 , 23S rRNA m1G748 methyltransferase , RlmaII , Rlma II , tylosin-resistance methyltransferase RlmA(II) , TlrB , rRNA large subunit methyltransferase II ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (guanine 748 -N 1 )-methyltransferase . 1 2 3 4 5 6 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine 748 in 23S rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 1 - methylguanine 748 in 23S rRNA   The enzyme specifically methylates guanine 748 at N 1 in 23S rRNA.
