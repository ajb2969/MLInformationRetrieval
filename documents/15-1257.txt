23S rRNA (guanine748-N1)-methyltransferase

23S rRNA (guanine748-N1)-methyltransferase (, Rlma(II), Rlma2, 23S rRNA m1G748 methyltransferase, RlmaII, Rlma II, tylosin-resistance methyltransferase RlmA(II), TlrB, rRNA large subunit methyltransferase II) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (guanine748-N1)-methyltransferase.123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine748 in 23S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N1-methylguanine748 in 23S rRNA
 

The enzyme specifically methylates guanine748 at N1 in 23S rRNA.
