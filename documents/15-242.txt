   Deletion channel      Deletion channel   A deletion channel is a communications channel model used in coding theory and information theory . In this model, a transmitter sends a bit (a zero or a one), and the receiver either receives the bit (with probability   p   p   p   ) or does not receive anything without being notified that the bit was dropped (with probability    1  -  p      1  p    1-p   ). Determining the capacity of the deletion channel is an open problem. 1 2  The deletion channel should not be confused with the binary erasure channel which is much simpler to analyze.  Formal description  Let   p   p   p   be the deletion probability,    0  <  p  <  1        0  p       1     0   . The iid binary deletion channel is defined as follows: given a input sequence of   n   n   n   bits    (   X  i   )     subscript  X  i    (X_{i})   as input, each bit in    X  n     subscript  X  n    X_{n}   can be deleted with probability   p   p   p   . The deletion positions are unknown to the sender and the receiver. The output sequence    (   Y  i   )     subscript  Y  i    (Y_{i})   is the sequence of the    (   X  i   )     subscript  X  i    (X_{i})   which were not deleted, in the correct order and with no errors.  Capacity  The capacity of the binary deletion channel (as an analytical expression of the deletion rate   p   p   p   ) is unknown. It has a mathematical expression . Several upper and lower bounds are known.  External links   Implementation of correction for deletion channel   References  "  Category:Coding theory     . ↩  . ↩
