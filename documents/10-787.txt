Jasmonate O-methyltransferase




Jasmonate O-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a jasmonate O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + jasmonate 
 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + methyl jasmonate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and jasmonate, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and methyl jasmonate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:jasmonate O-methyltransferase. This enzyme is also called jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase.
