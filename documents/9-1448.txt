   Brocard's problem      Brocard's problem   Brocard's problem is a problem in mathematics that asks to find integer values of n for which         n  !   +  1   =   m  2    ,          n   1    superscript  m  2     n!+1=m^{2},     where n! is the factorial . It was posed by Henri Brocard in a pair of articles in 1876 and 1885, and independently in 1913 by Srinivasa Ramanujan .   Brown numbers  Pairs of the numbers ( n , m ) that solve Brocard's problem are called Brown numbers . There are only three known pairs of Brown numbers:   (4,5), (5,11), and (7,71).   Paul Erd≈ës conjectured that no other solutions exist.  showed that there are only finitely many solutions provided that the abc conjecture is true.  performed calculations for n up to 10 9 and found no further solutions.  Variants of the problem  generalized Overholt's result by showing that it would follow from the abc conjecture that        n  !   +  A   =   k  2           n   A    superscript  k  2     n!+A=k^{2}     has only finitely many solutions, for any given integer A . This result was further generalized by , who showed (again assuming the abc conjecture) that the equation       n  !   =   P   (  x  )          n     P  x     n!=P(x)     has only finitely many integer solutions for a given polynomial  P ( x ) of degree at least 2 with integer coefficients.
