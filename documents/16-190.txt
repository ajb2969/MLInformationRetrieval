Categorical quotient

In algebraic geometry, given a category C, a categorical quotient of an object X with action of a group G is a morphism

 
  that

(i) is invariant; i.e., 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the given group action and p2 is the projection.
 
(ii) satisfies the universal property: any morphism 
 
 
 
  satisfying (i) uniquely factors through 
 
 
 
 .
 

One of the main motivations for the development of geometric invariant theory was the construction of a categorical quotient for varieties or schemes.
Note 
 
 
 
  need not be surjective. Also, if it exists, a categorical quotient is unique up to a canonical isomorphism. In practice, one takes C to be the category of varieties or the category of schemes over a fixed scheme. A categorical quotient 
 
 
 
  is a universal categorical quotient if it is stable under base change: for any 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a categorical quotient.
A basic result is that geometric quotients (e.g., 
 
 
 
 ) and GIT quotients (e.g., 
 
 
 
 ) are categorical quotients.
