   Beal's conjecture      Beal's conjecture   Beal's conjecture is a conjecture in number theory :   If            A  x   +   B  y    =   C  z    ,         superscript  A  x    superscript  B  y     superscript  C  z     A^{x}+B^{y}=C^{z},         where A , B , C , x , y , and z are positive integers with x , y , z > 2, then A , B , and C have a common prime factor .   Equivalently,   There are no solutions to the above equation in positive integers A, B, C, x, y, z with A, B , and C being pairwise coprime and all of x, y, z being greater than 2.   Billionaire banker Andrew Beal formulated this conjecture in 1993 while investigating generalizations of Fermat's last theorem . 1 It has been claimed that the same conjecture was formulated independently by Robert Tijdeman and Don Zagier . 2 While more commonly known as the "Beal conjecture", it has also been referred to as the Tijdeman–Zagier conjecture . 3 4 5  In the 1950s, L. Jesmanowicz and Chao Ko considered a potential class of solutions to the equation, namely those with A, B, C also forming a Pythagorean triple . 6  For a proof or counterexample published in a refereed journal, Beal initially offered a prize of US $5,000 in 1997, raising it to $50,000 over ten years, 7 but has since raised it to US $1,000,000. 8  Related examples  To illustrate, the solution      3  3   +   6  3    =   3  5          superscript  3  3    superscript  6  3     superscript  3  5     3^{3}+6^{3}=3^{5}   has bases with a common factor of 3, the solution      7  3   +   7  4    =   14  3          superscript  7  3    superscript  7  4     superscript  14  3     7^{3}+7^{4}=14^{3}   has bases with a common factor of 7, and      2  n   +   2  n    =   2   n  +  1           superscript  2  n    superscript  2  n     superscript  2    n  1      2^{n}+2^{n}=2^{n+1}   has bases with a common factor of 2. Indeed the equation has infinitely many solutions where the bases share a common factor, including generalizations of the above three examples, respectively         3   3  n    +    [   2   (   3  n   )    ]   3    =   3    3  n   +  2     ;         superscript  3    3  n     superscript   delimited-[]    2   superscript  3  n     3     superscript  3      3  n   2      3^{3n}+[2(3^{n})]^{3}=3^{3n+2};       n  ≥  1      n  1    n\geq 1             (    a  n   -  1   )    2  n    +    (    a  n   -  1   )     2  n   +  1     =    [   a    (    a  n   -  1   )   2    ]   n    ;         superscript     superscript  a  n   1     2  n     superscript     superscript  a  n   1       2  n   1      superscript   delimited-[]    a   superscript     superscript  a  n   1   2     n     (a^{n}-1)^{2n}+(a^{n}-1)^{2n+1}=[a(a^{n}-1)^{2}]^{n};        a  ≥  2   ,   n  ≥  3      formulae-sequence    a  2     n  3     a\geq 2,n\geq 3     and          [   a   (    a  n   +   b  n    )    ]   n   +    [   b   (    a  n   +   b  n    )    ]   n    =    (    a  n   +   b  n    )    n  +  1     ;         superscript   delimited-[]    a     superscript  a  n    superscript  b  n      n    superscript   delimited-[]    b     superscript  a  n    superscript  b  n      n     superscript     superscript  a  n    superscript  b  n      n  1      [a(a^{n}+b^{n})]^{n}+[b(a^{n}+b^{n})]^{n}=(a^{n}+b^{n})^{n+1};        a  ≥  1   ,    b  ≥  1   ,   n  ≥  3       formulae-sequence    a  1    formulae-sequence    b  1     n  3      a\geq 1,b\geq 1,n\geq 3     Furthermore, for each solution (with or without coprime bases), there are infinitely many solutions with the same set of exponents and an increasing set of non-coprime bases. That is, for solution        A  1  x   +   B  1  y    =   C  1  z          superscript   subscript  A  1   x    superscript   subscript  B  1   y     superscript   subscript  C  1   z     A_{1}^{x}+B_{1}^{y}=C_{1}^{z}     we additionally have         A  n  x   +   B  n  y    =   C  n  z    ;         superscript   subscript  A  n   x    superscript   subscript  B  n   y     superscript   subscript  C  n   z     A_{n}^{x}+B_{n}^{y}=C_{n}^{z};       n  ≥  2      n  2    n\geq 2     where       A  n   =    (   A   n  -  1     y  z   +  1    )    (   B   n  -  1    y  z    )    (   C   n  -  1    y  z    )         subscript  A  n      superscript   subscript  A    n  1        y  z   1     superscript   subscript  B    n  1      y  z     superscript   subscript  C    n  1      y  z       A_{n}=(A_{n-1}^{yz+1})(B_{n-1}^{yz})(C_{n-1}^{yz})          B  n   =    (   A   n  -  1    x  z    )    (   B   n  -  1     x  z   +  1    )    (   C   n  -  1    x  z    )         subscript  B  n      superscript   subscript  A    n  1      x  z     superscript   subscript  B    n  1        x  z   1     superscript   subscript  C    n  1      x  z       B_{n}=(A_{n-1}^{xz})(B_{n-1}^{xz+1})(C_{n-1}^{xz})          C  n   =    (   A   n  -  1    x  y    )    (   B   n  -  1    x  y    )    (   C   n  -  1     x  y   +  1    )         subscript  C  n      superscript   subscript  A    n  1      x  y     superscript   subscript  B    n  1      x  y     superscript   subscript  C    n  1        x  y   1       C_{n}=(A_{n-1}^{xy})(B_{n-1}^{xy})(C_{n-1}^{xy+1})     Any solutions to the Beal conjecture will necessarily involve three terms all of which are 3-powerful numbers , i.e. numbers where the exponent of every prime factor is at least three. It is known that there are an infinite number of such sums involving coprime 3-powerful numbers; 9 however, such sums are rare. The smallest two examples are:        271  3   +    2  3    3  5    73  3     =   919  3          superscript  271  3      superscript  2  3    superscript  3  5    superscript  73  3      superscript  919  3     \displaystyle 271^{3}+2^{3}3^{5}73^{3}=919^{3}     What distinguishes Beal's conjecture is that it requires each of the three terms to be expressible as a single power.  Relation to other conjectures  Fermat's Last Theorem established that      A  n   +   B  n    =   C  n          superscript  A  n    superscript  B  n     superscript  C  n     A^{n}+B^{n}=C^{n}   has no solutions for n > 2 for positive integers A , B , and C . If any solutions had existed to Fermat's Last Theorem, then by dividing out every common factor, there would also exist solutions with A , B , and C coprime. Hence, Fermat's Last Theorem can be seen as a special case of the Beal conjecture restricted to x = y = z .  The Fermat–Catalan conjecture is that      A  x   +   B  y    =   C  z          superscript  A  x    superscript  B  y     superscript  C  z     A^{x}+B^{y}=C^{z}   has only finitely many solutions with A , B , and C being positive integers with no common prime factor and x , y , and z being positive integers satisfying      1  x   +   1  y   +   1  z    <  1.          1  x     1  y     1  z    1.    \frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}+\frac{1}{z}<1.   Beal's conjecture can be restated as "All Fermat–Catalan conjecture solutions will use 2 as an exponent."  The abc conjecture would imply that there are at most finitely many counterexamples to Beal's conjecture.  Partial results  In the cases below where 2 is an exponent, multiples of 2 are also proven, since a power can be squared.   The case x = y = z is Fermat's Last Theorem , proven to have no solutions by Andrew Wiles in 1994. 10    The case gcd ( x , y , z ) > 2 is implied by Fermat's Last Theorem.    The case ( x , y , z ) = (2, 4, 4) was proven to have no solutions by Pierre de Fermat in the 1600s. (See one proof here .)    The case ( x , y , z ) = ( n , 4, 4) has been proven for n ≥ 2. 11    The case ( x , y , z ) = (2, 3, 7) and all its permutations were proven to have only four solutions, none of them involving an even power greater than 2, by Bjorn Poonen , Edward F. Schaefer, and Michael Stoll in 2005. 12    The case ( x , y , z ) = (2, 3, 8) and all its permutations are known to have only three solutions, none of them involving an even power greater than 2. 13    The case ( x , y , z ) = (2, 3, 9) and all its permutations are known to have only two solutions, neither of them involving an even power greater than 2. 14 15    The case ( x , y , z ) = (2, 3, 10) was proved by David Brown in 2009. 16    The case ( x , y , z ) = (2, 3, 15) was proved by Samir Siksek and Michael Stoll in 2013. 17    The case ( x , y , z ) = (2, 4, n ) was proved for n ≥ 4 by Michael Bennet, Jordan Ellenberg , and Nathan Ng in 2009. 18    The case ( x , y , z ) = ( n , n , 2) has been proven for n ≥ 4. 19    The case ( x , y , z ) = ( n , n , 3) has been proven for n ≥ 3. 20    The case ( x , y , z ) = (3, 3, n ) has been proven for n equal to 4, 5, or 17 ≤ n ≤ 10000. 21    The cases (5, 5, 7), (5, 5, 19) and (7, 7, 5) were proved by Sander R. Dahmen and Samir Siksek in 2013. 22    The case A = 1 is implied by Catalan's conjecture , proven in 2002 by Preda Mihăilescu .    Faltings' theorem implies that for every specific choice of exponents ( x , y , z ), there are at most finitely many solutions. 23    Peter Norvig , Director of Research at Google , reported having conducted a series of numerical searches for counterexamples to Beal's conjecture. Among his results, he excluded all possible solutions having each of x , y , z ≤ 7 and each of A , B , C ≤ 250,000, as well as possible solutions having each of x , y , z ≤ 100 and each of A , B , C ≤ 10,000. 24   Invalid variants  The counterexamples      7  3   +   13  2    =   2  9          superscript  7  3    superscript  13  2     superscript  2  9     7^{3}+13^{2}=2^{9}   and      1  m   +   2  3    =   3  2          superscript  1  m    superscript  2  3     superscript  3  2     1^{m}+2^{3}=3^{2}   show that the conjecture would be false if one of the exponents were allowed to be 2. The Fermat–Catalan conjecture is an open conjecture dealing with such cases.  A variation of the conjecture asserting that x , y , z (instead of A , B , C ) must have a common prime factor is not true. A counterexample is       27  4   +   162  3    =   9  7    ,         superscript  27  4    superscript  162  3     superscript  9  7     27^{4}+162^{3}=9^{7},   in which 4, 3, and 7 have no common prime factor. (In fact, the maximum common prime factor of the exponents that is valid is 2; a common factor greater than 2 would be a counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem.)  The conjecture is not valid over the larger domain of Gaussian integers . After a prize of $50 was offered for a counterexample, Fred W. Helenius provided        (    -  2   +  i   )   3   +    (    -  2   -  i   )   3    =    (   1  +  i   )   4    .         superscript      2   i   3    superscript      2   i   3     superscript    1  i   4     (-2+i)^{3}+(-2-i)^{3}=(1+i)^{4}.    25  See also   Euler's sum of powers conjecture  Jacobi–Madden equation  Prouhet–Tarry–Escott problem  Taxicab number  Pythagorean quadruple  Sums of powers , a list of related conjectures and theorems  Distributed Computing  BOINC   References  External links   The Beal Prize office page  Bealconjecture.com  Math.unt.edu    Mathoverflow.net  Beal@Home Distributed Computing project   "  Category:Diophantine equations  Category:Conjectures     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩   Wacław Sierpiński , Pythagorean triangles , Dover, 2003, p. 55 (orig.
