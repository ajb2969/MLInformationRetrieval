   Courant minimax principle      Courant minimax principle   In mathematics, the Courant minimax principle gives the eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix . It is named after Richard Courant .  Introduction  The Courant minimax principle gives a condition for finding the eigenvalues for a real symmetric matrix. The Courant minimax principle is as follows:  For any real symmetric matrix A ,        λ  k   =    min  C     max   (        ∥  x  ∥   =  1         C  x   =  0       )     ⟨   A  x   ,  x  ⟩      ,       subscript  λ  k     subscript   C     subscript    binomial     norm  x   1       C  x   0       A  x   x      \lambda_{k}=\min\limits_{C}\max\limits_{{\left({{\|x\|=1}\atop{Cx=0}}\right)}}%
 \langle Ax,x\rangle,     where C is any ( k − 1) × n matrix.  Notice that the vector x is an eigenvector to the corresponding eigenvalue λ .  The Courant minimax principle is a result of the maximum theorem, which says that for q ( x ) = , A being a real symmetric matrix, the largest eigenvalue is given by λ 1 = max || x ||=1 q ( x ) = q ( x 1 ), where x 1 is the corresponding eigenvectors. Also (in the maximum theorem) subsequent eigenvalues λ k and eigenvectors x k are found by induction and orthogonal to each other; therefore, λ k = max q ( x k ) with k > = 0, j
