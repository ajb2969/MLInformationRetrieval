Courant minimax principle

In mathematics, the Courant minimax principle gives the eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix. It is named after Richard Courant.
Introduction
The Courant minimax principle gives a condition for finding the eigenvalues for a real symmetric matrix. The Courant minimax principle is as follows:
For any real symmetric matrix A,



where C is any (k − 1) × n matrix.
Notice that the vector x is an eigenvector to the corresponding eigenvalue λ.
The Courant minimax principle is a result of the maximum theorem, which says that for q(x) = , A being a real symmetric matrix, the largest eigenvalue is given by λ1 = max||x||=1q(x) = q(x1), where x1 is the corresponding eigenvectors. Also (in the maximum theorem) subsequent eigenvalues λk and eigenvectors xk are found by induction and orthogonal to each other; therefore, λk = max q(xk) with k> = 0, j
