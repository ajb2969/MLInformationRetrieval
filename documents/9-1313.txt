== Summary == This plot shows the locations of the zeros of the Jacobi polynomials of order 8 as a function of the Jacobi parameter,
 
 
 
 , on the left side. On the right is the corresponding Lebesgue constant for the grid. The dashed line indicates the special case 
 
 
 
  which gives the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. The minimum Lebesgue number occurs very close to 
 
 
 
 .
