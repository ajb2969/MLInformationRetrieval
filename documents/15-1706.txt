5''-phosphoribostamycin phosphatase

5''-phosphoribostamycin phosphatase (, btrP (gene), neoI (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 5-phosphoribostamycin phosphohydrolase''.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

5''-phosphoribostamycin + H2O $\rightleftharpoons$ ribostamycin + phosphate
