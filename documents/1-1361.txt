   Step-index profile      Step-index profile   For an optical fiber , a step-index profile is a refractive index profile characterized by a uniform refractive index within the core and a sharp decrease in refractive index at the core- cladding  interface so that the cladding is of a lower refractive index. The step-index profile corresponds to a power-law index profile with the profile parameter approaching infinity. The step-index profile is used in most single-mode fibers 1 and some multimode fibers . 2  A step-index fiber is characterized by the core and cladding refractive indices n 1 and n 2 and the core and cladding radii a and b. Examples of standard core and cladding diameters 2a/2b are 8/125, 50/125, 62.5/125, 85/125, or 100/140 (units of µm). The fractional refractive-index change     △   =     n  1   -   n  2     n  1    ≪  1        normal-△       subscript  n  1    subscript  n  2     subscript  n  1      much-less-than    1     \triangle\,=\frac{n_{1}-n_{2}}{n_{1}}\ll\ 1   . The value of n 1 is typically between 1.44 and 1.46, and   △   normal-△   \triangle   is typically between 0.001 and 0.02.  Step-index optical fiber is generally made by doping high-purity fused silica glass (SiO 2 ) with different concentrations of materials like titanium, germanium, or boron.  Pulse dispersion in a step index optical fiber is given by      pulse dispersion  =     △     n  1    ℓ   c       pulse dispersion      normal-△   subscript  n  1   normal-ℓ   c     \text{pulse dispersion}=\frac{\triangle\ n_{1}\ \ell}{c}\,\!     where     △   normal-△   \triangle\,\!   is the difference in refractive indices of core and cladding.      n  1     subscript  n  1    n_{1}\,\!   is the refractive index of core     ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell\,\!   is the length of the optical fiber under observation      c  =    3  ×    10  8      ms   -  1         c      3   superscript  10  8     superscript  ms    1       c=3\times 10^{8}\,\mathrm{ms}^{-1}\,\!
