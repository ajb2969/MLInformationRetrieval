Sucrose:sucrose fructosyltransferase

In enzymology, a sucrose:sucrose fructosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2 sucrose 
 
 
 
  D-glucose + beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2->1)-beta-D-fructofuranosyl + alpha-D-glucopyranoside
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, sucrose, but 3 products: D-glucose, beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2->1)-beta-D-fructofuranosyl, and alpha-D-glucopyranoside.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sucrose:sucrose 1'-beta-D-fructosyltransferase. Other names in common use include SST, sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase, sucrose-sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase, sucrose 1F-fructosyltransferase, and sucrose:sucrose 1F-beta-D-fructosyltransferase.
