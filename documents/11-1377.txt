   Sucrose synthase      Sucrose synthase   (Figure)  Ribbon diagram of Sucrose Synthase-1 3S27 Structure, isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana . 1   In enzymology , a sucrose synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   NDP-glucose + D-fructose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   NDP + sucrose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are NDP-glucose and D-fructose , whereas its two products are NDP and sucrose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is NDP-glucose:D-fructose 2-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include UDPglucose-fructose glucosyltransferase , sucrose synthetase , sucrose-UDP glucosyltransferase , sucrose-uridine diphosphate glucosyltransferase , and uridine diphosphoglucose-fructose glucosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism .  References              "  Category:EC 2.4.1     ; rendered with PyMOL ↩
