Its vertex figure is a 16-cell. Two tesseracts meet at each cubic cell, four meet at each square face, eight meet on each edge, and sixteen meet at each vertex.
It is an analog of the square tiling, {4,4}, of the plane and the cubic honeycomb, {4,3,4}, of 3-space. These are all part of the hypercubic honeycomb family of tessellations of the form {4,3,...,3,4}. Tessellations in this family are Self-dual.
Coordinates
Vertices of this honeycomb can be positioned in 4-space in all integer coordinates (i,j,k,l).
Constructions
There are many different Wythoff constructions of this honeycomb. The most symmetric form is regular, with Schläfli symbol {4,3,3,4}. Another form has two alternating tesseract facets (like a checkerboard) with Schläfli symbol {4,3,31,1}. The lowest symmetry Wythoff construction has 16 types of facets around each vertex and a prismatic product Schläfli symbol {∞}4. One can be made by stericating another.
Related polytopes and tessellations
The 24-cell honeycomb is similar, but as a body centered cubic, it has vertices positioned at integers (i,j,k,l), and half integers (i+1/2,j+1/2,k+1/2,l+1/2).
The tesseract can make a regular tessellation of the 4-sphere, with three tesseracts per face, with Schläfli symbol {4,3,3,3}, called a order-3 tesseractic honeycomb. It is topologically equivalent to the regular polytope penteract in 5-space.
The tesseract can make a regular tessellation of 4-dimensional hyperbolic space, with 5 tesseracts around each face, with Schläfli symbol {4,3,3,5}, called an order-5 tesseractic honeycomb.
Birectified tesseractic honeycomb
A birectified tesseractic honeycomb, , contains all rectified 16-cell (24-cell) facets and is the Voronoi tessellation of the D4* lattice. Facets can be identically colored from a doubled 
 
 
 
 ×2, [[4,3,3,4]] symmetry, alternately colored from 
 
 
 
 , [4,3,3,4] symmetry, three colors from

 , [31,1,1,1] symmetry.
