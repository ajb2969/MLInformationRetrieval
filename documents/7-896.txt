   Rotation number      Rotation number    ''This article is about the rotation number , which is sometimes called the map winding number or simply winding number . There is another meaning for winding number , which appears in complex analysis .''   In mathematics , the rotation number is an invariant of homeomorphisms of the circle . It was first defined by Henri Poincaré in 1885, in relation to the precession of the perihelion of a planetary orbit . Poincaré later proved a theorem characterizing the existence of periodic orbits in terms of rationality of the rotation number.  Definition  Suppose that f : S 1 → S 1 is an orientation preserving homeomorphism of the circle  S 1 = R / Z . Then f may be lifted to a homeomorphism  F : R → R of the real line, satisfying       F   (   x  +  m   )    =    F   (  x  )    +  m         F    x  m        F  x   m     F(x+m)=F(x)+m     for every real number x and every integer m .  The rotation number of f is defined in terms of the iterates of F :        ω   (  f  )    =    lim   n  →  ∞        F  n    (  x  )    -  x   n     .        ω  f     subscript    normal-→  n            superscript  F  n   x   x   n      \omega(f)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{F^{n}(x)-x}{n}.     Henri Poincaré proved that the limit exists and is independent of the choice of the starting point x . The lift F is unique modulo integers, therefore the rotation number is a well-defined element of R / Z . Intuitively, it measures the average rotation angle along the orbits of f .  Example  If f is a rotation by θ , so that        F   (  x  )    =   x  +  θ    ,        F  x     x  θ     F(x)=x+\theta,     then its rotation number is θ (cf Irrational rotation ).  Properties  The rotation number is invariant under topological conjugacy , and even topological semiconjugacy : if f and g are two homeomorphisms of the circle and       h  ∘  f   =   g  ∘  h         h  f     g  h     h\circ f=g\circ h     for a continuous map h of the circle into itself (not necessarily homeomorphic) then f and g have the same rotation numbers. It was used by Poincaré and Arnaud Denjoy for topological classification of homeomorphisms of the circle. There are two distinct possibilities.   The rotation number of f is a rational number  p / q (in the lowest terms). Then f has a periodic orbit , every periodic orbit has period q , and the order of the points on each such orbit coincides with the order of the points for a rotation by p / q . Moreover, every forward orbit of f converges to a periodic orbit. The same is true for backward orbits, corresponding to iterations of f −1 , but the limiting periodic orbits in forward and backward directions may be different.    The rotation number of f is an irrational number  θ . Then f has no periodic orbits (this follows immediately by considering a periodic point x of f ). There are two subcases.   :# There exists a dense orbit. In this case f is topologically conjugate to the irrational rotation by the angle θ and all orbits are dense . Denjoy proved that this possibility is always realized when f is twice continuously differentiable.  :# There exists a Cantor set  C invariant under f . Then C is a unique minimal set and the orbits of all points both in forward and backward direction converge to C . In this case, f is semiconjugate to the irrational rotation by θ , and the semiconjugating map h of degree 1 is constant on components of the complement of C .  Rotation number is continuous when viewed as a map from the group of homeomorphisms (with    C  0     superscript  C  0    C^{0}   topology) of the circle into the circle.
