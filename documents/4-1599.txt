   Herbrand–Ribet theorem      Herbrand–Ribet theorem   In mathematics , the Herbrand–Ribet theorem is a result on the class group of certain number fields . It is a strengthening of Ernst Kummer 's theorem to the effect that the prime p divides the class number of the cyclotomic field of p -th roots of unity  if and only if  p divides the numerator of the n -th Bernoulli number  B n for some n , 0 n .  The Galois group Δ of the cyclotomic field of p th roots of unity for an odd prime p , Q (ζ) with ζ p = 1, consists of the p − 1 group elements σ a , where      σ  a    (  ζ  )    =   ζ  a          subscript  σ  a   ζ    superscript  ζ  a     \sigma_{a}(\zeta)=\zeta^{a}   . As a consequence of the Fermat's little theorem , in the ring of p -adic integers     ℤ  p     subscript  ℤ  p    \mathbb{Z}_{p}   we have p − 1 roots of unity, each of which is congruent mod p to some number in the range 1 to p − 1; we can therefore define a Dirichlet character ω (the Teichmüller character) with values in    ℤ  p     subscript  ℤ  p    \mathbb{Z}_{p}   by requiring that for n relatively prime to p , ω( n ) be congruent to n modulo p . The p part of the class group is a    ℤ  p     subscript  ℤ  p    \mathbb{Z}_{p}   -module (since it is p -primary), hence a module over the group ring      ℤ  p    [  Δ  ]        subscript  ℤ  p    delimited-[]  normal-Δ     \mathbb{Z}_{p}[\Delta]   . We now define idempotent elements of the group ring for each n from 1 to p − 1, as        ϵ  n   =    1   p  -  1      ∑   a  =  1    p  -  1     ω    (  a  )   n    σ  a   -  1        .       subscript  ϵ  n       1    p  1      superscript   subscript     a  1      p  1      ω   superscript  a  n    superscript   subscript  σ  a     1         \epsilon_{n}=\frac{1}{p-1}\sum_{a=1}^{p-1}\omega(a)^{n}\sigma_{a}^{-1}.     It is easy to see that     ∑   ϵ  n    =  1         subscript  ϵ  n    1    \sum\epsilon_{n}=1   and      ϵ  i    ϵ  j    =    δ   i  j     ϵ  i           subscript  ϵ  i    subscript  ϵ  j       subscript  δ    i  j     subscript  ϵ  i      \epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{j}=\delta_{ij}\epsilon_{i}   where    δ   i  j      subscript  δ    i  j     \delta_{ij}   is the Kronecker delta . This allows us to break up the p part of the ideal class group G of Q (ζ) by means of the idempotents; if G is the ideal class group, then, letting G n = ε n ( G ), we have    G  =   ⊕   G  n        G   direct-sum   subscript  G  n      G=\oplus G_{n}   .  The Herbrand–Ribet theorem states that for odd n , G n is nontrivial if and only if p divides the Bernoulli number B p − n . 1 The part saying p divides B p − n if G n is not trivial is due to Jacques Herbrand . 2 The converse, that if p divides B p − n then G n is not trivial is due to Kenneth Ribet , and is considerably more difficult. By class field theory , this can only be true if there is an unramified extension of the field of p th roots of unity by a cyclic extension of degree p which behaves in the specified way under the action of Σ; Ribet proves this by actually constructing such an extension using methods in the theory of modular forms . A more elementary proof of Ribet's converse to Herbrand's theorem, a consequence of the theory of Euler systems , can be found in Washington's book. 3  The theorem makes no assertion about even values of n , but there is no known p for which G n is nontrivial for any even n : triviality for all p would be a consequence of Vandiver's conjecture . 4  Ribet's methods were pushed further by Barry Mazur and Andrew Wiles in order to prove the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory , 5 a corollary of which is a strengthening of the Herbrand–Ribet theorem: the power of p dividing B p − n is exactly the power of p dividing the order of G n .
