   Dominating decision rule      Dominating decision rule   In decision theory , a decision rule is said to dominate another if the performance of the former is sometimes better, and never worse, than that of the latter.  Formally, let    δ  1     subscript  δ  1    \delta_{1}   and    δ  2     subscript  δ  2    \delta_{2}   be two decision rules , and let    R   (  θ  ,  δ  )       R   θ  δ     R(\theta,\delta)   be the risk of rule   δ   δ   \delta   for parameter   θ   θ   \theta   . The decision rule    δ  1     subscript  δ  1    \delta_{1}   is said to dominate the rule    δ  2     subscript  δ  2    \delta_{2}   if     R   (  θ  ,   δ  1   )    ≤   R   (  θ  ,   δ  2   )          R   θ   subscript  δ  1       R   θ   subscript  δ  2       R(\theta,\delta_{1})\leq R(\theta,\delta_{2})   for all   θ   θ   \theta   , and the inequality is strict for some   θ   θ   \theta   . 1  This defines a partial order on decision rules; the maximal elements with respect to this order are called admissible decision rules . 2  References  "  Category:Decision theory     . ↩
