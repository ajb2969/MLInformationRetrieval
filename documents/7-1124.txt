Dominating decision rule

In decision theory, a decision rule is said to dominate another if the performance of the former is sometimes better, and never worse, than that of the latter.
Formally, let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be two decision rules, and let 
 
 
 
  be the risk of rule 
 
 
 
  for parameter 
 
 
 
 . The decision rule 
 
 
 
  is said to dominate the rule 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , and the inequality is strict for some 
 
 
 
 .1
This defines a partial order on decision rules; the maximal elements with respect to this order are called admissible decision rules.2
