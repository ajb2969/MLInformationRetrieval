   List of Indian inventions and discoveries      List of Indian inventions and discoveries   This list of Indian inventions and discoveries details the inventions, scientific discoveries and contributions of India, including both the ancient and medieval nations in the subcontinent historically referred to as India and the modern Indian state. It draws from the whole cultural and technological history of India, during which architecture , astronomy , cartography , metallurgy , logic , mathematics , metrology and mineralogy were among the branches of study pursued by its scholars . During recent times science and technology in the Republic of India has also focused on automobile engineering , information technology , communications as well as research into space and polar technology.  For the purposes of this list, inventions are regarded as technological firsts developed in India, and as such does not include foreign technologies which India acquired through contact. It also does not include technologies or discoveries developed elsewhere and later invented separately in India, nor inventions by Indian emigres in other places. Changes in minor concepts of design or style and artistic innovations do not appear on the list.  Inventions   Button : Ornamental buttons—made from seashell —were used in the Indus Valley Civilization for ornamental purposes by 2000 BCE. Hesse, Rayner W. & Hesse (Jr.), Rayner W. (2007). Jewelrymaking Through History: An Encyclopedia . Greenwood Publishing Group. 35. ISBN 0-313-33507-9. Some buttons were carved into geometric shapes and had holes pierced into them so that they could be attached to clothing by using a thread. Ian McNeil (1990) holds that: "The button, in fact, was originally used more as an ornament than as a fastening, the earliest known being found at Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley . It is made of a curved shell and about 5000 years old." 1  Carbon pigment : The source of the carbon pigment used in India ink was India. 2 3 In India, the carbon black from which India ink is produced is obtained by burning bones, tar, pitch, and other substances. 4 5 Ink itself has been used in India since at least the 4th century BCE. 6  Masi , an early ink in India was an admixture of several chemical components. 7 Indian documents written in Kharosthi with ink have been unearthed in Xinjiang . 8 The practice of writing with ink and a sharp pointed needle was common in ancient South India . 9 Several Jain sutras in India were compiled in ink. 10  Calico : Calico had originated in the subcontinent by the 11th century and found mention in Indian literature, by the 12th-century writer Hemachandra. He has mentioned calico fabric prints done in a lotus design. 11 The Indian textile merchants traded in calico with the Africans by the 15th century and calico fabrics from Gujarat appeared in Egypt . 12 Trade with Europe followed from the 17th century onwards. 13 Within India, calico originated in Kozhikode . 14  Carding devices : Historian of science Joseph Needham ascribes the invention of bow-instruments used in textile technology to India. 15 The earliest evidence for using bow-instruments for carding comes from India (2nd century CE). 16 These carding devices, called kaman and dhunaki would loosen the texture of the fiber by the means of a vibrating string. 17   (Figure)  Map showing origin and diffusion of chess from India to Asia , Africa , and Europe , and the changes in the native names of the game in corresponding places and time.    Chaturanga : The precursor of chess originated in India during the Gupta dynasty (c. 280-550 CE). 18 19 20 21 Both the Persians and Arabs ascribe the origins of the game of Chess to the Indians. 22 23 24 The words for "chess" in Old Persian and Arabic are chatrang and shatranj respectively — terms derived from caturaṅga in Sanskrit , 25 26 which literally means an army of four divisions or four corps . 27 28 Chess spread throughout the world and many variants of the game soon began taking shape. 29 This game was introduced to the Near East from India and became a part of the princely or courtly education of Persian nobility. 30  Buddhist pilgrims, Silk Road traders and others carried it to the Far East where it was transformed and assimilated into a game often played on the intersection of the lines of the board rather than within the squares. 31 Chaturanga reached Europe through Persia, the Byzantine empire and the expanding Arabian empire. 32 33  Muslims carried Shatranj to North Africa , Sicily , and Spain by the 10th century where it took its final modern form of chess. 34  Chintz : The origin of Chintz is from the printed all cotton fabric of calico in India. 35 The origin of the word chintz itself is from the Hindi language word चित्र् (chitr), which means an image. 36 37  Crescograph : The crescograph, a device for measuring growth in plants, was invented in the early 20th century by the Bengali scientist Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose . 38 39  Crucible steel : Perhaps as early as 300 BCE—although certainly by 200 CE—high quality steel was being produced in southern India also by what Europeans would later call the crucible technique. 40 In this system, high-purity wrought iron, charcoal, and glass were mixed in a crucible and heated until the iron melted and absorbed the carbon. 41 The first crucible steel was the wootz steel that originated in India before the beginning of the common era. 42 Archaeological and Tamil language  literary evidence suggests that this manufacturing process was already in existence in South India well before the Christian era, exported from the dynasty Chera and called Seric Iron in Rome. 43 44 45 46  Dock (maritime) : The earliest known docks were not South Asian, but rather those discovered in Wadi al-Jarf , an ancient Egyptian  habor dating from 2500 BCE located on the Red Sea coast. 47 48 A structure at Lothal (2400 BCE) is considered the earliest Indian dock by some archaeologists, apparently located away from the main current to avoid deposition of silt. 49 Modern oceanographers have observed that the Harappans must have possessed knowledge relating to tides in order to build such a dock on the ever-shifting course of the Sabarmati , as well as exemplary hydrography and maritime engineering. 50 This was the earliest known dock found in the world, equipped to berth and service ships. 51 52 It is speculated that Lothal engineers studied tidal movements, and their effects on brick-built structures, since the walls are of kiln-burnt bricks. 53 This knowledge also enabled them to select Lothal's location in the first place, as the Gulf of Khambhat has the highest tidal amplitude and ships can be sluiced through flow tides in the river estuary. 54 However, these speculations have been called into question, as it has been suggested by other archaeologists 55 that the supposed dockyard at Lothal was nothing more than an irrigation tank.

Incense clock : Although popularly associated with China the incense clock is believed to have originated in India, at least in its fundamental form if not function. 56 57 Early incense clocks found in China between the 6th and 8th centuries CE—the period it appeared in China all seem to have Devanāgarī carvings on them instead of Chinese seal characters. 58 59 Incense itself was introduced to China from India in the early centuries CE, along with the spread of Buddhism by travelling monks. 60 61 62  Edward Schafer asserts that incense clocks were probably an Indian invention, transmitted to China, which explains the Devanāgarī inscriptions on early incense clocks found in China. 63  Silvio Bedini on the other hand asserts that incense clocks were derived in part from incense seals mentioned in Tantric Buddhist scriptures, which first came to light in China after those scriptures from India were translated into Chinese, but holds that the time-telling function of the seal was incorporated by the Chinese. 64  Indian clubs : The Indian club—which appeared in Europe during the 18th century—was used long by India's native soldiery before its introduction to Europe. 65 During the British Raj the British officers in India performed calisthenic exercises with clubs to keep in for physical conditioning. 66 From Britain the use of club swinging spread to the rest of the world. 67  Iron and mercury coherer : In 1899, the Bengali physicist Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose announced the development of an " iron-mercury-iron coherer with telephone detector " in a paper presented at the Royal Society, London. 68 He also later received , " Detector for electrical disturbances " (1904), for a specific electromagnetic receiver.  Kabaddi : The game of kabaddi originated in India during prehistory. 69 Suggestions on how it evolved into the modern form range from wrestling exercises, military drills, and collective self-defense but most authorities agree that the game existed in some form or the other in India during the period between 1500 and 400 BCE. 70  Ludo : Pachisi originated in India by the 6th century. 71 The earliest evidence of this game in India is the depiction of boards on the caves of Ajanta. 72 This game was played by the Mughal emperors of India; a notable example being that of Akbar, who played living Pachisi using girls from his harem . 73 Stephen M. Edwardes and Herbert Garrett;   Mughal rule in India, Atlantic Publishers & Distributors, 1995, 374 pages ISBN 81-7156-551-4, ISBN 978-81-7156-551-1 From p.288: Pachisi, an ancient Hindu game represented in the caves of Ajanta, is said to have been played by Akbar on the marble squares of a quadrangle in Agra fort and in the Khas Mahal at Fatehpur Sikri , with young slave girls in place of the coloured pieces.  A variant of this game, called Luodo, made its way to England during the British Raj. 74   Muslin : The fabric was named after the city where Europeans first encountered it, Mosul , in what is now Iraq , but the fabric actually originated from Dhaka in what is now Bangladesh . 75 76 In the 9th century, an Arab merchant named Sulaiman makes note of the material's origin in Bengal (known as Ruhml in Arabic ). 77  Mysorean rockets : The first iron-cased and metal-cylinder rockets were developed by Tipu Sultan , ruler of the South Indian Kingdom of Mysore , and his father Hyder Ali , in the 1780s. He successfully used these iron-cased rockets against the larger forces of the British East India Company during the Anglo-Mysore Wars . The Mysore rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2 km range). After Tipu's eventual defeat in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket , and were soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars . 78 "Hyder Ali, prince of Mysore, developed war rockets with an important change: the use of metal cylinders to contain the combustion powder. Although the hammered soft iron he used was crude, the bursting strength of the container of black powder was much higher than the earlier paper construction. Thus a greater internal pressure was possible, with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet. The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick. Range was perhaps up to three-quarters of a mile (more than a kilometre). Although individually these rockets were not accurate, dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks. They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air, after lighting, or skimmed along the hard dry ground. Hyder Ali's son, Tippu Sultan , continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons, reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1,200 to a corps of 5,000. In battles at Seringapatam in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British." - Encyclopædia Britannica (2008) . rocket and missile.   (Figure)  The Great Stupa at Sanchi (4th-1st century BCE). The dome shaped stupa was used in India as a commemorative monument associated with storing sacred relics.    Palampore : पालमपुर् (Hindi language) of Indian origin 79 was imported to the western world—notable England and Colonial america —from India. 80 81 In 17th-century England these hand painted cotton fabrics influenced native crewel work design. 82 Shipping vessels from India also took palampore to colonial America, where it was used in quilting . 83    Prayer flags : The Buddhist  sūtras , written on cloth in India, were transmitted to other regions of the world. 84 These sutras, written on banners, were the origin of prayer flags. 85 Legend ascribes the origin of the prayer flag to the Shakyamuni Buddha , whose prayers were written on battle flags used by the devas against their adversaries, the asuras . 86 The legend may have given the Indian bhikku a reason for carrying the 'heavenly' banner as a way of signyfying his commitment to ahimsa . 87 This knowledge was carried into Tibet by 800 CE, and the actual flags were introduced no later than 1040 CE, where they were further modified. 88 The Indian monk Atisha (980-1054 CE) introduced the Indian practice of printing on cloth prayer flags to Tibet. 89  Prefabricated home and movable structure : The first prefabricated homes and movable structures were invented in 16th-century Mughal India by Akbar . These structures were reported by Arif Qandahari in 1579. 90   (Figure)  Wayang Kulit (shadow puppet) in Wayang Purwa type, depicting five Pandava , from left to right: Bhima , Arjuna , Yudhishtira , Nakula , and Sahadeva (Museum Indonesia, Jakarta ). Ghosh, Massey, and Banerjee (2006) trace the origins of puppetry in India to the Indus Civilization.    Ruler : Rulers made from Ivory were in use by the Indus Valley Civilization in what today is Pakistan and some parts of Western India prior to 1500 BCE. 91 Excavations at Lothal (2400 BCE) have yielded one such ruler calibrated to about 1/16 of an inch—less than 2 millimeters . 92 Ian Whitelaw (2007) holds that 'The Mohenjo-Daro ruler is divided into units corresponding to 1.32 inches (33.5 mm) and these are marked out in decimal subdivisions with amazing accuracy—to within 0.005 of an inch. They correspond closely with the "hasta" increments of 1 3/8 inches traditionally used in South India in ancient architecture. Ancient bricks found throughout the region have dimensions that correspond to these units.' 93 Shigeo Iwata (2008) further writes 'The minimum division of graduation found in the segment of an ivory-made linear measure excavated in Lothal was 1.79 mm (that corresponds to 1/940 of a fathom), while that of the fragment of a shell-made one from Mohenjo-daro was 6.72 mm (1/250 of a fathom), and that of bronze-made one from Harapa was 9.33 mm (1/180 of a fathom).' 94 The weights and measures of the Indus civilization also reached Persia and Central Asia , where they were further modified. 95    Seamless celestial globe : Considered one of the most remarkable feats in metallurgy , it was invented in Kashmir by Ali Kashmiri ibn Luqman in between 1589 and 1590 CE, and twenty other such globes were later produced in Lahore and Kashmir during the Mughal Empire. 96 97 Before they were rediscovered in the 1980s, it was believed by modern metallurgists to be technically impossible to produce metal globes without any seams , even with modern technology. 98 These Mughal metallurgists pioneered the method of lost-wax casting in order to produce these globes. 99    Shampoo : The word shampoo in English is derived from Hindustani  chāmpo (चाँपो ), 100 and dates to 1762. 101 The shampoo itself originated in the eastern regions of the Mughal Empire that ruled erstwhile India , particularly in the Nawab of Bengal where it was introduced as a head massage , usually consisting of alkali , natural oils and fragrances . Shampoo was first introduced in Britain by a Bengali entrepreneur from Bihar named Sake Dean Mahomed , he first familiarized the shampoo in Basil Cochrane's vapour baths while working there in the early 19th century. Later, Sake Dean Mahomed together with his Irish wife, opened "Mahomed's Steam and Vapour Sea Water Medicated Baths" in Brighton , England . His baths were like Turkish baths where clients received a treatment of champi (shampooing). Very soon due to Sake Dean Mahomed fame as a bathing expert he was appointed ‘Shampooing Surgeon’ to both George IV and William IV . 102  Single roller cotton gin : The Ajanta caves of India yield evidence of a single roller cotton gin in use by the 5th century. 103 This cotton gin was used in India until innovations were made in form of foot powered gins. 104 The cotton gin was invented in India as a mechanical device known as charkhi , more technically the "wooden-worm-worked roller". This mechanical device was, in some parts of India, driven by water power. 105  Snakes and ladders : Snakes and ladders originated in India as a game based on morality. 106 During British rule of India, this game made its way to England, and was eventually introduced in the United States of America by game-pioneer Milton Bradley in 1943. 107  Stepwell : Earliest clear evidence of the origins of the stepwell is found in the Indus Valley Civilization's archaeological site at Mohenjodaro in Pakistan. Livingston & Beach, 20 The three features of stepwells in the subcontinent are evident from one particular site, abandoned by 2500 BCE, which combines a bathing pool, steps leading down to water, and figures of some religious importance into one structure. The early centuries immediately before the common era saw the Buddhists and the Jains of India adapt the stepwells into their architecture. Both the wells and the form of ritual bathing reached other parts of the world with Buddhism. Rock-cut step wells in the subcontinent date from 200 to 400 CE. Subsequently the wells at Dhank (550-625 CE) and stepped ponds at Bhinmal (850-950 CE) were constructed. Livingston & Beach, page xxiii  Stupa : The origin of the stupa can be traced to 3rd-century BCE India. 108 It was used as a commemorative monument associated with storing sacred relics. 109 The stupa architecture was adopted in Southeast and East Asia , where it evolved into the pagoda , a Buddhist monument used for enshrining sacred relics. 110    Suits game : Kridapatram is an early suits game, made of painted rags, invented in Ancient India. The term kridapatram literally means "painted rags for playing." 111 112 113 114 115 Paper playing cards first appeared in East Asia during the 9th century. 116 117 The medieval Indian game of ganjifa , or playing cards, is first recorded in the 16th century. 118  Toe stirrup : The earliest known manifestation of the stirrup, which was a toe loop that held the big toe was used in India in as early as 500 BCE 119 or perhaps by 200 BCE according to other sources. 120 121 This ancient stirrup consisted of a looped rope for the big toe which was at the bottom of a saddle made of fibre or leather. 122 Such a configuration made it suitable for the warm climate of most of India where people used to ride horses barefoot. 123 A pair of megalithic double bent iron bars with curvature at each end, excavated in Junapani in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh have been regarded as stirrups although they could as well be something else. 124 Buddhist carvings in the temples of Sanchi, Mathura and the Bhaja caves dating back between the 1st and 2nd century BCE figure horsemen riding with elaborate saddles with feet slipped under girths. 125 126 127  Sir John Marshall described the Sanchi relief as "the earliest example by some five centuries of the use of stirrups in any part of the world". 128 In the 1st century CE horse riders in northern India, where winters are sometimes long and cold, were recorded to have their booted feet attached to hooked stirrups. 129 However the form, the conception of the primitive Indian stirrup spread west and east, gradually evolving into the stirrup of today. 130 131  Wootz steel : Wootz originated in India before the beginning of the common era. 132 Wootz steel was widely exported and traded throughout ancient Europe, China, the Arab world, and became particularly famous in the Middle East , where it became known as Damascus steel . Archaeological evidence suggests that this manufacturing process was already in existence in South India well before the Christian era they also made trains what were pulled by horses under ground. 133 134   Discoveries  Agriculture  (Figure)  Jute plants Corchorus olitorius and Corchorus capsularis cultivated first in India.    Cashmere wool : The fiber is also known as pashm or pashmina for its use in the handmade shawls of Kashmir, India. 135 The woolen shawls made from wool in Kashmir region of India find written mention between the 3rd century BCE and the 11th century CE. 136 However, the founder of the cashmere wool industry is traditionally held to be the 15th-century ruler of Kashmir, Zayn-ul-Abidin , who employed weavers from Central Asia . 137  Cotton cultivation : Cotton was cultivated by the inhabitants of the Indus Valley Civilization by the 5th millennium BCE - 4th millennium BCE . 138 The Indus cotton industry was well developed and some methods used in cotton spinning and fabrication continued to be practiced till the modern Industrialization of India. 139 Well before the Common Era , the use of cotton textiles had spread from India to the Mediterranean and beyond. 140  Indigo dye : Indigo, a blue pigment and a dye, was used in India, which was also the earliest major center for its production and processing. Kriger & Connah (2006), page 120 The Indigofera tinctoria variety of Indigo was domesticated in India. Indigo, used as a dye, made its way to the Greeks and the Romans via various trade routes, and was valued as a luxury product.  Jute cultivation : Jute has been cultivated in India since ancient times. 141 Raw jute was exported to the western world , where it was used to make ropes and cordage. 142 The Indian jute industry, in turn, was modernized during the British Raj in India. 143 The region of Bengal was the major center for Jute cultivation, and remained so before the modernization of India's jute industry in 1855, when Kolkata became a center for jute processing in India. 144  Sugar refinement : Sugarcane was originally from tropical South Asia and Southeast Asia . 145 Different species different locaations are' originating in India and S. edule and S. officinarum coming from New Guinea . 146 The process of producing crystallized sugar from sugarcane was discovered by the time of the Imperial Guptas , 147 and the earliest reference of candied sugar comes from India. 148 The process was soon transmitted to China with traveling Buddhist monks. 149 Chinese documents confirm at least two missions to India, initiated in 647 CE, for obtaining technology for sugar-refining. 150 Each mission returned with results on refining sugar. 151   Mathematics      Number System   Numbers       0   1     Gurmukhi   o     Oriya   ୦     Bengali   ০     Devanagari   ०     Gujarati   ૦     Tibetan   ༠     Brahmi      Telugu   ౦     Kannada   ೦     Malayalam   ൦     Tamil   ೦     Burmese   ၀     Khmer   ០     Thai   ๐     Lao   ໐     Balinese   ᭐     Javanese   ꧐        AKS primality test : The AKS primality test is a deterministic  primality-proving  algorithm created and published by three Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur computer scientists, Manindra Agrawal , Neeraj Kayal , and Nitin Saxena on 6 August 2002 in a paper titled PRIMES is in P . 152 153 Commenting on the impact of this discovery, Paul Leyland noted: "One reason for the excitement within the mathematical community is not only does this algorithm settle a long-standing problem, it also does so in a brilliantly simple manner. Everyone is now wondering what else has been similarly overlooked". 154 155   Baudhāyana, (fl. c. 800 BCE)[1] was the author of the Baudhayana sūtras,[2] which cover dharma, daily ritual, mathematics, etc. He belongs to the Yajurveda school, and is older than the other sūtra author Āpastamba. He was the author of the earliest of the Shulba Sutras—appendices to the Vedas giving rules for the construction of altars—called the Baudhāyana Śulbasûtra. These are notable from the point of view of mathematics, for containing several important mathematical results, including giving a value of pi to some degree of precision, and stating a version of what is now known as the Pythagorean theorem. Sequences associated with primitive Pythagorean triples have been named Baudhayana sequences. These sequences have been used in cryptography as random sequences and for the generation of keys   Finite Difference Interpolation : The Indian mathematician Brahmagupta presented what is possibly the first instance 156 157 of finite difference interpolation around 665 CE. 158  Algebraic abbreviations : The mathematician Brahmagupta had begun using abbreviations for unknowns by the 7th century. 159 He employed abbreviations for multiple unknowns occurring in one complex problem. 160 Brahmagupta also used abbreviations for square roots and cube roots . 161  Basu's theorem : The Basu's theorem, a result of Debabrata Basu (1955) states that any complete sufficient statistic is independent of any ancillary statistic. 162 163  Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity , Brahmagupta formula , Brahmagupta matrix , and Brahmagupta theorem : Discovered by the Indian mathematician, Brahmagupta (598–668 CE). 164 165 166 167  Chakravala method : The Chakravala method, a cyclic algorithm to solve indeterminate  quadratic equations is commonly attributed to Bhāskara II , (c. 1114 – 1185 CE) 168 169 170 although some attribute it to Jayadeva (c. 950~1000 CE). 171 Jayadeva pointed out that Brahmagupta’s approach to solving equations of this type would yield infinitely large number of solutions, to which he then described a general method of solving such equations. 172 Jayadeva's method was later refined by Bhāskara II in his Bijaganita treatise to be known as the Chakravala method, chakra (derived from cakraṃ चक्रं) meaning 'wheel' in Sanskrit , relevant to the cyclic nature of the algorithm. 173 174 With reference to the Chakravala method, E. O. Selenuis held that no European performances at the time of Bhāskara, nor much later, came up to its marvellous height of mathematical complexity. 175 176 177  Hindu number system : With decimal place-value and a symbol for zero, this system was the ancestor of the widely used Arabic numeral system. It was developed in the Indian subcontinent between the 1st and 6th centuries CE. 178 179  Fibonacci numbers : This sequence was first described by Virahanka (c. 700 AD), Gopāla (c. 1135), and Hemachandra (c. 1150), 180 as an outgrowth of the earlier writings on Sanskrit prosody by Pingala (c. 200 BC).  Zero , symbol: Indians were the first to use the zero as a symbol and in arithmetic operations, although Babylonians used zero to signify the 'absent'. 181 In those earlier times a blank space was used to denote zero, later when it created confusion a dot was used to denote zero (could be found in Bakhshali manuscript ). 182 In 500 AD circa Aryabhata again gave a new symbol for zero ( 0 ).  Law of signs in multiplication : The earliest use of notation for negative numbers, as subtrahend , is credited by scholars to the Chinese, dating back to the 2nd century BC. 183 Like the Chinese, the Indians used negative numbers as subtrahend, but were the first to establish the "law of signs" with regards to the multiplication of positive and negative numbers, which did not appear in Chinese texts until 1299. 184 Indian mathematicians were aware of negative numbers by the 7th century, 185 and their role in mathematical problems of debt was understood. 186 Mostly consistent and correct rules for working with negative numbers were formulated, 187 and the diffusion of these rules led the Arab intermediaries to pass it on to Europe. 188  Madhava series : The infinite series for π and for the trigonometric sine , cosine , and arctangent is now attributed to Madhava of Sangamagrama (c. 1340 – 1425) and his Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics. 189 190 He made use of the series expansion of    arctan  x      x    \arctan x   to obtain an infinite series expression for π. 191 Their rational approximation of the error for the finite sum of their series are of particular interest. They manipulated the error term to derive a faster converging series for π. 192 They used the improved series to derive a rational expression, 193     104348  /  33215      104348  33215    104348/33215   for π correct up to eleven decimal places, i.e.    3.14159265359   3.14159265359   3.14159265359   . 194 195 Madhava of Sangamagrama and his successors at the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics used geometric methods to derive large sum approximations for sine, cosin, and arttangent. They found a number of special cases of series later derived by Brook Taylor series. They also found the second-order Taylor approximations for these functions, and the third-order Taylor approximation for sine. 196 197 198  Pascal's triangle : Described in the 6th century CE by Varahamihira 199 and in the 10th century by Halayudha , 200 commenting on an obscure reference by Pingala (the author of an earlier work on prosody) to the "Meru-prastaara", or the "Staircase of Mount Meru", in relation to binomial coefficients. (It was also independently discovered in the 10th or 11th century in Persia and China.)  Pell's equation , integral solution for : About a thousand years before Pell's time, Indian scholar Brahmagupta (598–668 CE) was able to find integral solutions to vargaprakṛiti (Pell's equation): 201 202         x   2   -   N   y  2     =  1   ,         superscript  x  2     N   superscript  y  2     1    \ x^{2}-Ny^{2}=1,   where N is a nonsquare integer, in his Brâhma-sphuṭa-siddhânta treatise. 203  Ramanujan theta function , Ramanujan prime , Ramanujan summation , Ramanujan graph and Ramanujan's sum : Discovered by the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan in the early 20th century. 204  Shrikhande graph : Graph invented by the Indian mathematician S.S. Shrikhande in 1959.  Sign convention : Symbols, signs and mathematical notation were employed in an early form in India by the 6th century when the mathematician-astronomer Aryabhata recommended the use of letters to represent unknown quantities. 205 By the 7th century Brahmagupta had already begun using abbreviations for unknowns, even for multiple unknowns occurring in one complex problem. 206 Brahmagupta also managed to use abbreviations for square roots and cube roots. 207 By the 7th century fractions were written in a manner similar to the modern times, except for the bar separating the numerator and the denominator . 208 A dot symbol for negative numbers was also employed. 209 The Bakhshali Manuscript displays a cross, much like the modern '+' sign, except that it symbolized subtraction when written just after the number affected. 210 The '=' sign for equality did not exist. 211 Indian mathematics was transmitted to the Islamic world where this notation was seldom accepted initially and the scribes continued to write mathematics in full and without symbols. 212   Trigonometry was invented in India.* Trigonometric functions (adapted from Greek): * Trigonometric functions (adapted from Greek): The trigonometric functions sine and versine originated in Indian astronomy , adapted from the full-chord Greek versions (to the modern half-chord versions). They were described in detail by Aryabhata in the late 5th century, but were likely developed earlier in the Siddhantas , astronomical treatises of the 3rd or 4th century. 213 214 Later, the 6th-century astronomer Varahamihira discovered a few basic trigonometric formulas and identities, such as sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1. 215 The first use of the idea of ‘sine’ in the way we use it today was in the work Aryabhatiyam by Aryabhata, in A.D. 500. Aryabhata used the word ardha-jya for the half-chord, which was shortened to jya or jiva in due course. When the Aryabhatiyam was translated into Arabic, the word jiva was retained as it is. The word jiva was translated into sinus, which means curve, when the Arabic version was translated into Latin. Soon the word sinus, also used as sine, became common in mathematical texts throughout Europe. An English Professor of astronomy Edmund Gunter (1581–1626), first used the abbreviated notation ‘sin’. The origin of the terms ‘cosine’ and ‘tangent’ was much later. The cosine function arose from the need to compute the sine of the complementary angle. Aryabhatta called it kotijya. The name cosinus originated with Edmund Gunter. In 1674, the English Mathematician Sir Jonas Moore first used the abbreviated notation ‘cos’.  Medicine     Ayurvedic and Siddha medicine : Ayurveda and Siddha are ancient and traditional systems of medicine. Ayurveda dates back to Iron Age India 216 (1st millennium BC) and still practiced today as a form of complementary and alternative medicine . It means "knowledge for longevity". 217 Siddha medicine is mostly prevalent in South India. Herbs and minerals are basic raw materials of the Siddha system which dates back to the period of siddha saints around the 5th century BC. 218 219  Cataract surgery : Cataract surgery was known to the Indian physician Sushruta (6th century BCE). 220 In India, cataract surgery was performed with a special tool called the Jabamukhi Salaka , a curved needle used to loosen the lens and push the cataract out of the field of vision. 221 The eye would later be soaked with warm butter and then bandaged. 222 Though this method was successful, Susruta cautioned that cataract surgery should only be performed when absolutely necessary. 223 Greek philosophers and scientists traveled to India where these surgeries were performed by physicians. 224 The removal of cataract by surgery was also introduced into China from India. 225  Cure for Leprosy : Kearns & Nash (2008) state that the first mention of leprosy is described in the Indian medical treatise Sushruta Samhita (6th century BCE). Kearns & Nash (2008) However, The Oxford Illustrated Companion to Medicine holds that the mention of leprosy, as well as ritualistic cures for it, were described in the Atharva-veda (1500–1200 BCE), written before the Sushruta Samhita . 226  Plastic surgery : Plastic surgery was being carried out in India by 2000 BCE. 227 The system of punishment by deforming a miscreant's body may have led to an increase in demand for this practice. 228 The surgeon Sushruta contributed mainly to the field of plastic and cataract surgery. Dwivedi & Dwivedi 2007 The medical works of both Sushruta and Charak were translated into Arabic language during the Abbasid Caliphate (750 CE). 229 These translated Arabic works made their way into Europe via intermediaries. 230 In Italy the Branca family of Sicily and Gaspare Tagliacozzi of Bologna became familiar with the techniques of Sushruta. 231  Lithiasis treatment : The earliest operation for treating lithiasis, or the formations of stones in the body, is also given in the Sushruta Samhita (6th century BCE). 232 The operation involved exposure and going up through the floor of the bladder. 233  Visceral leishmaniasis, treatment of : The Indian (Bengali) medical practitioner Upendranath Brahmachari (19 December 1873 – 6 February 1946) was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1929 for his discovery of 'ureastibamine ( antimonial  compound for treatment of kala azar ) and a new disease, post-kalaazar dermal leishmanoid.' 234 Brahmachari's cure for Visceral leishmaniasis was the urea salt of para-amino-phenyl stibnic acid which he called Urea Stibamine. 235 Following the discovery of Urea Stibamine, Visceral leishmaniasis was largely eradicated from the world, except for some underdeveloped regions. 236   Mining   Diamond mining and diamond tools : Diamonds were first recognized and mined in central India, 237 238 239 where significant alluvial deposits of the stone could then be found along the rivers Penner , Krishna and Godavari . It is unclear when diamonds were first mined in India, although estimated to be at least 5,000 years ago. 240 India remained the world's only source of diamonds until the discovery of diamonds in Brazil in the 18th century. 241 242 243  Golconda served as an important centre for diamonds in central India . 244 Diamonds then were exported to other parts of the world, including Europe . 245 Early references to diamonds in India come from Sanskrit texts. 246 The Arthashastra of Kautilya mentions diamond trade in India. 247  Buddhist works dating from the 4th century BCE mention it as a well-known and precious stone but don't mention the details of diamond cutting. 248 Another Indian description written at the beginning of the 3rd century describes strength, regularity, brilliance, ability to scratch metals, and good refractive properties as the desirable qualities of a diamond. 249 A Chinese work from the 3rd century BCE mentions: "Foreigners wear it [diamond] in the belief that it can ward off evil influences". 250 The Chinese, who did not find diamonds in their country, initially used diamonds as a "jade cutting knife" instead of as a jewel. 251  Zinc mining and medicinal zinc : Zinc was first smelted from zinc ore in India. 252 Zinc mines of Zawar, near Udaipur , Rajasthan , were active during early Christian era. 253 254 There are references of medicinal uses of zinc in the Charaka Samhita (300 BCE). 255 The Rasaratna Samuccaya which dates back to the Tantric period (c. 5th - 13th century CE) explains the existence of two types of ores for zinc metal, one of which is ideal for metal extraction while the other is used for medicinal purpose. 256 257   Sciences     Ammonium nitrite, synthesis in pure form : Prafulla Chandra Roy synthesized NH 4 NO 2 in its pure form, and became the first scientist to have done so. 258 Prior to Ray’s synthesis of Ammonium nitrite it was thought that the compound undergoes rapid thermal decomposition releasing nitrogen and water in the process. 259  Ashtekar variables : In theoretical physics, Ashtekar (new) variables, named after Abhay Ashtekar who invented them, represent an unusual way to rewrite the metric on the three-dimensional spatial slices in terms of a SU(2)  gauge field and its complementary variable. Ashtekar variables are the key building block of loop quantum gravity .  Bhatnagar-Mathur Magnetic Interference Balance : Invented jointly by Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar and K.N. Mathur in 1928, the so-called 'Bhatnagar-Mathur Magnetic Interference Balance' was a modern instrument used for measuring various magnetic properties. 260 The first appearance of this instrument in Europe was at a Royal Society exhibition in London , where it was later marketed by British firm Messers Adam Hilger and Co, London. 261  Bhabha scattering : In 1935, Indian nuclear physicist Homi J. Bhabha published a paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series A , in which he performed the first calculation to determine the cross section of electron-positron scattering. 262 Electron-positron scattering was later named Bhabha scattering, in honor of his contributions in the field. 263  Bose–Einstein statistics , condensate and Boson : On 4 June 1924 the Bengali professor of Physics Satyendra Nath Bose mailed a short manuscript to Albert Einstein entitled Planck's Law and the Light Quantum Hypothesis seeking Einstein's influence to get it published after it was rejected by the prestigious journal Philosophical Magazine . 264 The paper introduced what is today called Bose statistics , which showed how it could be used to derive the Planck blackbody spectrum from the assumption that light was made of photons . 265 266 Einstein, recognizing the importance of the paper translated it into German himself and submitted it on Bose's behalf to the prestigious Zeitschrift für Physik . 267 268 Einstein later applied Bose's principles on particles with mass and quickly predicted the Bose-Einstein condensate . 269 270  Braunstein-Ghosh-Severini Entropy : This modelling of entropy using network theory is used in the analysis of quantum gravity and is named after Sibasish Ghosh and his team-mates, Samuel L. Braunstein and Simone Severini.  Chandrasekhar limit and Chandrasekhar number : Discovered by and named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar , who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1983 for his work on stellar structure and stellar evolution . 271  Galena, applied use in electronics of : Bengali scientist Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose effectively used Galena crystals for constructing radio receivers. 272 The Galena receivers of Bose were used to receive signals consisting of shortwave , white light and ultraviolet light . 273 In 1904 Bose patented the use of Galena Detector which he called Point Contact Diode using Galena . 274  Mahalanobis distance : Introduced in 1936 by the Indian (Bengali) statistician Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis (29 June 1893 – June 28, 1972), this distance measure, based upon the correlation between variables, is used to identify and analyze differing pattern with respect to one base. 275  Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève theorem : Also known as the Karhunen–Loève theorem . The Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève theorem is a representation of a stochastic process as an infinite linear combination of orthogonal functions , analogous to a Fourier series representation of a function on a bounded interval. Stochastic processes given by infinite series of this form were first 276 considered by Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi . 277  Mercurous Nitrite : The compound mercurous nitrite was discovered in 1896 by the Bengali chemist Prafulla Chandra Roy, who published his findings in the Journal of Asiatic Society of Bengal . 278 The discovery contributed as a base for significant future research in the field of chemistry. 279  Ramachandran plot , Ramachandran map, and Ramachandran angles : The Ramachandran plot and Ramachandran map were developed by Gopalasamudram Narayana Iyer Ramachandran , who published his results in the Journal of Molecular Biology in 1963. He also developed the Ramachandran angles, which serve as a convenient tool for communication , representation, and various kinds of data analysis . 280  Raman effect : The Encyclopædia Britannica (2008) reports: "change in the wavelength of light that occurs when a light beam is deflected by molecules. The phenomenon is named for Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman , who discovered it in 1928. When a beam of light traverses a dust-free, transparent sample of a chemical compound, a small fraction of the light emerges in directions other than that of the incident (incoming) beam. Most of this scattered light is of unchanged wavelength. A small part, however, has wavelengths different from that of the incident light; its presence is a result of the Raman effect." 281  Raychaudhuri equation : Discovered by the Bengali physicist Amal Kumar Raychaudhuri in 1954. This was a key ingredient of the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems of general relativity . 282  Saha ionization equation : The Saha equation, derived by the Bengali scientist Meghnad Saha (6 October 1893 – 16 February 1956) in 1920, conceptualizes ionizations in context of stellar atmospheres. 283   Innovations   Iron working : Iron works were developed in the Vedic period of India, around the same time as, but independently of, Anatolia and the Caucasus . Archaeological sites in India, such as Malhar , Dadupur, Raja Nala Ka Tila and Lahuradewa in present-day Uttar Pradesh show iron implements in the period between 1800 BCE—1200 BCE. 284 Early iron objects found in India can be dated to 1400 BCE by employing the method of radiocarbon dating . Spikes , knives , daggers , arrow -heads, bowls , spoons , saucepans , axes , chisels , tongs, door fittings etc. ranging from 600 BCE to 200 BCE have been discovered from several archaeological sites of India. 285 Some scholars believe that by the early 13th century BC, iron smelting was practiced on a bigger scale in India, suggesting that the date the technology's inception may be placed earlier. 286 In Southern India (present day Mysore ) iron appeared as early as 11th to 12th centuries BC; these developments were too early for any significant close contact with the northwest of the country. 287 In the time of Chandragupta II Vikramaditya (375–413 CE), corrosion-resistant iron was used to erect the Iron pillar of Delhi , which has withstood corrosion for over 1,600 years. 288   See also   Nalanda University  History of science and technology in India  Timeline of historic inventions   References  Bibliography  A   Adas, Michael (January 2001).
