   Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NAD+)      Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NAD+)   In enzymology , a methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NAD + ) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:NAD + oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NAD + ) . This enzyme participates in one carbon pool by folate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
