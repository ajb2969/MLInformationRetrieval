Soluble quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase

Soluble quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase (, soluble glucose dehydrogenase, sGDH, glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-dependent)) is an enzyme with system name D-glucose:acceptor oxidoreductase.123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

D-glucose + acceptor 
 
 
 
  D-glucono-1,5-lactone + reduced acceptor
 

This soluble periplasmic enzyme contains PQQ as prosthetic group, and is bound to a calcium ion. Electron acceptor is not known.
