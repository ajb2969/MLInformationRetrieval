Nash–Moser theorem

The Nash–Moser theorem, attributed to mathematicians John Forbes Nash and Jürgen Moser, is a generalization of the inverse function theorem on Banach spaces to a class of "tame" Fréchet spaces.
Introduction
In contrast to the Banach space case, in which the invertibility of the derivative at a point is sufficient for a map to be locally invertible, the Nash–Moser theorem requires the derivative to be invertible in a neighborhood. The theorem is widely used to prove local existence for non-linear partial differential equations in spaces of smooth functions. It is particularly useful when the inverse to the derivative "loses" derivatives, and therefore the Banach space implicit function theorem cannot be used.
History
While  originated the theorem as a step in his proof of the Nash embedding theorem,  showed that Nash's methods could be successfully applied to solve problems on periodic orbits in celestial mechanics.
Formal statement
The formal statement of the theorem is as follows:1

Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be tame Frechet spaces and let 
 
 
 
  be a smooth tame map. Suppose that the equation for the derivative 
 
 
 
  has a unique solution 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and all 
 
 
 
 , and that the family of inverses 
 
 
 
  is a smooth tame map. Then P is locally invertible, and each local inverse 
 
 
 
  is a smooth tame map.
