   Nash–Moser theorem      Nash–Moser theorem   The Nash–Moser theorem , attributed to mathematicians  John Forbes Nash and Jürgen Moser , is a generalization of the inverse function theorem on Banach spaces to a class of "tame" Fréchet spaces .  Introduction  In contrast to the Banach space case, in which the invertibility of the derivative at a point is sufficient for a map to be locally invertible, the Nash–Moser theorem requires the derivative to be invertible in a neighborhood. The theorem is widely used to prove local existence for non-linear partial differential equations in spaces of smooth functions . It is particularly useful when the inverse to the derivative "loses" derivatives, and therefore the Banach space implicit function theorem cannot be used.  History  While  originated the theorem as a step in his proof of the Nash embedding theorem ,  showed that Nash's methods could be successfully applied to solve problems on periodic orbits in celestial mechanics .  Formal statement  The formal statement of the theorem is as follows: 1   Let   F   F   F   and   G   G   G   be tame Frechet spaces and let    P  :   U  ⊆  F  →  G      normal-:  P      U  F    normal-→    G      P:U\subseteq F\rightarrow G   be a smooth tame map. Suppose that the equation for the derivative     D  P   (  f  )   h   =  k        D  P  f  h   k    DP(f)h=k   has a unique solution    h  =   V  P   (  f  )   k       h    V  P  f  k     h=VP(f)k   for all    f  ∈  U      f  U    f\in U   and all   k   k   k   , and that the family of inverses     V  P   :    U  ×  G   →  F      normal-:    V  P    normal-→    U  G   F     VP:U\times G\rightarrow F   is a smooth tame map. Then P is locally invertible, and each local inverse    P   -  1      superscript  P    1     P^{-1}   is a smooth tame map.   References      .
