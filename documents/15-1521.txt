Free motion equation

A free motion equation is a differential equation that describes a mechanical system in the absence of external forces, but in the presence only of an inertial force depending on the choice of a reference frame. In non-autonomous mechanics on a configuration space 
 
 
 
 , a free motion equation is defined as a second order  non-autonomous dynamic equation on 
 
 
 
  which is brought into the form



with respect to some reference frame

 
  on 
 
 
 
 . Given an arbitrary reference frame 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , a free motion equation reads



where 
 
 
 
  is a connection on 
 
 
 
  associates with the initial reference frame 
 
 
 
 . The right-hand side of this equation is treated as an inertial force.
A free motion equation need not exist in general. It can be defined if and only if a configuration bundle 
 
 
 
  of a mechanical system is a toroidal cylinder 
 
 
 
 .
