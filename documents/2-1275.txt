List of integrals of irrational functions

The following is a list of integrals (antiderivative functions) of irrational functions. For a complete list of integral functions, see lists of integrals. Throughout this article the constant of integration is omitted for brevity.
== Integrals involving r = √a2 + x2 ==














































































== Integrals involving s = √x2 - a2 == Assume 
 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 









 
  Here 
 
 
 
 , where the positive value of 
 
 
 
  is to be taken.

























































== Integrals involving u = √a2 - x2 ==
























== Integrals involving R = √ax2 + bx + c ==
Assume (ax2 + bx + c) cannot be reduced to the following expression (px + q)2 for some p and q.











































} Then make another substitution with 
 
 
 
  so that the integral becomes


 
  The integral then has the form 
 
 
 
  as given above and can be readily evaluated.
One can also perform the substitutions in a single step with the less apparent choice 
 
 
 
 , giving

== Integrals involving S = √ax + b ==


















$$\int \frac{1}{x^{n} S} dx = -\frac{1}{b (n - 1)} \left( \frac{S}{x^{n - 1}} + \left( n - \frac{3}{2}\right) a \int \frac{dx}{x^{n - 1} S}\right)$$
