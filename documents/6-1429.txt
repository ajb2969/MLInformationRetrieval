   Parametric model      Parametric model   In statistics , a parametric model or parametric family or finite-dimensional model is a family of distributions that can be described using a finite number of parameters . These parameters are usually collected together to form a single k -dimensional parameter vector  θ = ( θ 1 , θ 2 , …, θ k ).  Parametric models are contrasted with the semi-parametric , semi-nonparametric , and non-parametric models , all of which consist of an infinite set of “parameters” for description. The distinction between these four classes is as follows:   in a “ parametric ” model all the parameters are in finite-dimensional parameter spaces;  a model is “ non-parametric ” if all the parameters are in infinite-dimensional parameter spaces;  a “ semi-parametric ” model contains finite-dimensional parameters of interest and infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters ;  a “ semi-nonparametric ” model has both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional unknown parameters of interest.   Some statisticians believe that the concepts “parametric”, “non-parametric”, and “semi-parametric” are ambiguous. 1 It can also be noted that the set of all probability measures has cardinality of continuum , and therefore it is possible to parametrize any model at all by a single number in (0,1) interval. 2 This difficulty can be avoided by considering only “smooth” parametric models.  Definition  A parametric model is a collection of probability distributions such that each member of this collection, P θ , is described by a finite-dimensional parameter θ . The set of all allowable values for the parameter is denoted Θ ⊆ R k , and the model itself is written as       𝒫  =   {    P  θ    |   θ  ∈  Θ   }    .      𝒫   conditional-set   subscript  P  θ     θ  normal-Θ      \mathcal{P}=\big\{P_{\theta}\ \big|\ \theta\in\Theta\big\}.   When the model consists of absolutely continuous distributions, it is often specified in terms of corresponding probability density functions :       𝒫  =   {    f  θ    |   θ  ∈  Θ   }    .      𝒫   conditional-set   subscript  f  θ     θ  normal-Θ      \mathcal{P}=\big\{f_{\theta}\ \big|\ \theta\in\Theta\big\}.   The parametric model is called identifiable if the mapping θ ↦ P θ is invertible, that is there are no two different parameter values θ 1 and θ 2 such that P θ 1 = P θ 2 .  Examples   The Poisson family of distributions is parametrized by a single number λ > 0:      𝒫  =   {      p  λ    (  j  )    =      λ  j    j  !      e   -  λ      ,   j  =   0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  3  ,   …      |   λ  >   0    }    ,      𝒫   conditional-set   formulae-sequence       subscript  p  λ   j        superscript  λ  j     j     superscript  e    λ        j   0  1  2  3  normal-…       λ  0      \mathcal{P}=\Big\{\ p_{\lambda}(j)=\tfrac{\lambda^{j}}{j!}e^{-\lambda},\ j=0,1%
 ,2,3,\dots\ \Big|\ \lambda>0\ \Big\},   where p λ is the probability mass function . This family is an exponential family .  The normal family is parametrized by θ = ( μ , σ ), where μ ∈ R is a location parameter, and σ > 0 is a scale parameter. This parametrized family is both an exponential family and a location-scale family :      𝒫  =   {     f  θ    (  x  )    =     1     2  π    σ       e   -    1   2   σ  2       (   x  -  μ   )   2         |    μ  ∈  ℝ   ,   σ  >   0     }    .      𝒫   conditional-set       subscript  f  θ   x       1        2  π    σ     superscript  e        1    2   superscript  σ  2      superscript    x  μ   2         formulae-sequence    μ  ℝ     σ  0       \mathcal{P}=\Big\{\ f_{\theta}(x)=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-\frac{1}{2%
 \sigma^{2}}(x-\mu)^{2}}\ \Big|\ \mu\in\mathbb{R},\sigma>0\ \Big\}.     The Weibull translation model has three parameters θ = ( λ , β , μ ):      𝒫  =   {     f  θ    (  x  )    =     β  λ       (     x  -  μ   λ    )    β  -  1       exp    (   -    (     x  -  μ   λ    )   β    )      1   {  x  >  μ  }       |    λ  >  0   ,    β  >  0   ,   μ  ∈   ℝ      }    .      𝒫   conditional-set       subscript  f  θ   x       β  λ    superscript      x  μ   λ     β  1         superscript      x  μ   λ   β      subscript  1   fragments  normal-{  x   μ  normal-}       formulae-sequence    λ  0    formulae-sequence    β  0     μ  ℝ        \mathcal{P}=\Big\{\ f_{\theta}(x)=\tfrac{\beta}{\lambda}\left(\tfrac{x-\mu}{%

 \mathbb{R}\ \Big\}.   This model is not regular (see definition below) unless we restrict β to lie in the interval (2, +∞).

The Fisher information matrix I ( θ ), defined as      I  θ   =   ∫    z  θ     z  θ  ′    d   P  θ          subscript  I  θ        subscript  z  θ    superscript   subscript  z  θ   normal-′   d   subscript  P  θ       I_{\theta}=\int\!z_{\theta}z_{\theta}^{\prime}\,dP_{\theta}   is nonsingular and continuous in θ .    If conditions (i)−(iii) hold then the parametric model is regular.   Local asymptotic normality .   If the regular parametric model is identifiable then there exists a uniformly    n      n    \scriptstyle\sqrt{n}   -consistent and efficient estimator of its parameter θ . 5   See also   Statistical model  Parametric family  Parametrization (i.e., coordinate system )  Parsimony (with regards to the trade-off of many or few parameters in data fitting)  Parametricism   Notes  References              "  Category:Statistical theory  Category:Statistical models     , ch.7.4 ↩  ↩  ↩  , p.13, prop.2.1.1 ↩  , Theorems 2.5.1, 2.5.2 ↩
