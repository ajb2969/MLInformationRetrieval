Glutaminyl-tRNA synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing)

In enzymology, a glutaminyl-tRNA synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + glutamyl-tRNAGln + L-glutamine 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + glutaminyl-tRNAGln + L-glutamate
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, glutamyl-tRNA(Gln), and L-glutamine, whereas its 4 products are ADP, phosphate, glutaminyl-tRNA(Gln), and L-glutamate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds carbon-nitrogen ligases with glutamine as amido-N-donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glutamyl-tRNAGln:L-glutamine amido-ligase (ADP-forming). Other names in common use include Glu-AdT, Glu-tRNAGln amidotransferase, glutamyl-tRNAGln amidotransferase, and Glu-tRNAGln:L-glutamine amido-ligase (ADP-forming). This enzyme participates in glutamate metabolism and alanine and aspartate metabolism.
