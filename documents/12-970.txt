Average order of an arithmetic function

In number theory, an average order of an arithmetic function is some simpler or better-understood function which takes the same values "on average".
Let f be an arithmetic function. We say that an average order of f is g if



as x tends to infinity.
It is conventional to choose an approximating function g that is continuous and monotone. But even so an average order is of course not unique.
In cases where the limit



exists, it is said that f has a mean value (average value) c.
Examples

An average order of d(n), the number of divisors of n, is log(n);
An average order of σ(n), the sum of divisors of n, is nπ2 / 6;
An average order of φ(n), Euler's totient function of n, is 6n / π2;
An average order of r(n), the number of ways of expressing n as a sum of two squares, is πn


The average order of representations of a natural number as a sum of three squares is 4πn/3


The average number of decompositions of a natural number into a sum of one or more consecutive prime numbers is nlog2.


An average order of ω(n), the number of distinct prime factors of n, is log log n;
An average order of Ω(n), the number of prime factors of n, is log log n;
The prime number theorem is equivalent to the statement that the von Mangoldt function Λ(n) has average order 1;
An average order of μ(n), the Möbius function, is zero; this is again equivalent to the prime number theorem.

Calculating mean values using Dirichlet series
In case F is of the form



  for some arithmetic function f(n), one has,



This identity often provides a practical way to calculate the mean value in terms of the Riemann zeta function. This is illustrated in the following example.
The density of the k-th power free integers in 
 
 

For an integer k≥1 the set Qk of k-th-power-free integers is


 
 .
We calculate the natural density of these numbers in 
 
 
 
 , that is, the average value of 1Qk, denoted by δ(n), in terms of the zeta function.
The function δ is multiplicative, and since it is bounded by 1, its Dirichlet series converges absolutely in the half-plane Re(s)>1, and there has Euler product


 
 .
By the Möbius inversion formula, we get



where 
 
 
 
  stands for the Möbius function. Equivalently,


 
  where 
 
 

and hence,


 
 .
By comparing the coefficients, we get


 
 .
Using (1), we get


 
 .
We conclude that,


 
 ,
Where for this we used the relation


 
 ,
which follows from the Möbius inversion formula.
In particular, the density of the square-free integers is 
 
 
 
 .
Visibility of lattice points
We say that two lattice points are visible from one another if there is no lattice point on the open line segment joining them.
Now, if gcd(a, b)=d>1, then writing a=da’, b=db’ one observes that the point (a’, b’) is on the line segment which joins (0,0) to (a, b) and hence (a, b) is not visible from the origin. Thus (a, b) is visible from the origin implies that (a, b)=1. Conversely, it is also easy to see that gcd(a, b)=1 implies that there is no other integer lattice point in the segment joining (0,0) to (a, b). Thus, (a, b) is visible from (0,0) if and only if gcd(a, b)=1.
Notice that 
 
 
 
  is the probability of a random point on the square 
 
 
 
  to be visible from the origin.
Thus, one can show that the natural density of the points which are visible from the origin is given by the average,


 
 .
interestingly, 
 
 
 
  is also the natural density of the square-free numbers in 
 
 
 
 . In fact, this is not a coincidence. Consider the k-dimensional lattice, 
 
 
 
 . The natural density of the points which are visible from the origin is 
 
 
 
 , which is also the natural density of the k-th free integers in 
 
 
 
 .
Divisor functions
Consider the generalization of 
 
 
 
 :


 
 .
The following are true: 
 
 

where 
 
 
 
 .
Better average order
This notion is best discussed through an example. From


 
  (
 
 
 
  is the Euler-Mascheroni constant) and


 
  we have the asymptotic relation


 
  which suggests that the function 
 
 
 
  is a better choice of average order for 
 
 
 
  than simply 
 
 
 
 .
Mean values over 
Definition
Let h(x) be a function on the set of monic polynomials over Fq. For 
 
 
 
  we define


 
 .
This is the mean value (average value) of h on the set of monic polynomials of degree n. We say that g(n) is an average order of h if



as n tends to infinity.
In cases where the limit,



exists, it is said that h has a mean value (average value) c.
Zeta function and Dirichlet series in 
Let =A be the ring of polynomials over the finite field .
Let h be a polynomial arithmetic function (i.e. a function on set of monic polynomials over A). Its corresponding Dirichlet series define to be


 
 ,
where for 
 
 
 
 , set 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  otherwise.
The polynomial zeta function is then


 
 .
Similar to the situation in 
 
 
 
 , every Dirichlet series of a multiplicative function h has a product representation (Euler product):


 
 ,
Where the product runs over all monic irreducible polynomials P.
For example, the product representation of the zeta function is as for the integers
 
 
 
 .
Unlike the classical zeta function, 
 
 
 
  is a simple rational function:


 
 .
In a similar way, If ƒ and g are two polynomial arithmetic functions, one defines ƒ * g, the Dirichlet convolution of ƒ and g, by



where the sum extends over all monic divisors d of m, or equivalently over all pairs (a, b) of monic polynomials whose product is m. The identity 
 
 
 
 
  still holds. Thus, like in the elementary theory, the polynomial Dirichlet series and the zeta function has a connection with the notion of mean values in the context of polynomials. The following examples illustrate it.
Examples
The density of the k-th power free polynomials in 
Define 
 
 
 
  to be 1 if 
 
 
 
  is k-th power free and 0 otherwise.
We calculate the average value of 
 
 
 
 , which is the density of the k-th power free polynomials in , in the same fashion as in the integers.
By multiplicativity of 
 
 
 
 :



Denote 
 
 
 
  the number of k-th power monic polynomials of degree n, we get


 
 .
Making the substitution 
 
 
 
  we get:


 
 .
Finally, expand the left-hand side in a geometric series and compare the coefficients on 
 
 
 
 
  on both sides, to conclude that



Hence,



And since it doesn't depend on n this is also the mean value of 
 
 
 
 .
Polynomial Divisor functions
In , we define


 
 .
We will compute 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
First, notice that:


where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Therefore,


 
 .
Substitute 
 
 
 
  we get,


 
 , and by Cauchy product we get,


 
 .
Finally we get that,


 
 .
Notice that



Thus, if we set 
 
 
 
  then the above result reads


 
 ,
which resembles the analogous result for the integers:



Number of divisors
Let 
 
 
 
  be the number of monic divisors of f and let 
 
 
 
  be the sum of 
 
 
 
  over all monics of degree n.



where 
 
 
 
 .
Expanding the right-hand side into power series we get,


 
 .
Substitute 
 
 
 
  the above equation becomes:


 
  which resembles closely the analogous result for integers 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is Euler constant.
It is interesting to note that not a lot is known about the error term for the integers, while in the polynomials case, there is no error term! This is because of the very simple nature of the zeta function 
 
 
 
 , and that it has NO zeros.
Polynomial von Mangoldt function
The Polynomial von Mangoldt function is defined by: 
 
 

Where the logarithm is taken on the basis of q.
Proposition. The mean value of 
 
 
 
  is exactly 1.
Proof. Let m be a monic polynomial, and let 
 
 
 
  be the prime decomposition of m.
We have,



Hence,



and we get that,


 
 . Now,


 
 .
Thus,


 
 .
We got that:



Now,



Hence,


 
 ,
  and by dividing by 
 
 
 
  we get that,


 
 .
Polynomial Euler totient function
Define Euler totient function polynomial analogue, 
 
 
 
 , to be the number of elements in the group 
 
 
 
 . We have,
