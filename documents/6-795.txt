   List of fractals by Hausdorff dimension      List of fractals by Hausdorff dimension   According to Falconer , one of the essential features of a fractal is that its Hausdorff dimension strictly exceeds its topological dimension . 1 Presented here is a list of fractals ordered by increasing Hausdorff dimension, with the purpose of visualizing what it means for a fractal to have a low or a high dimension.
