   Witten zeta function      Witten zeta function   In mathematics , the Witten zeta function , introduced by , is a function associated to a root system that encodes the degrees of the irreducible representations of the corresponding Lie group . It is a special case of the Shintani zeta function .  Definition  Witten's original definition of the zeta function of a semisimple Lie group was       ∑  R    1   dim    (  R  )   s         subscript   R     1   dimension   superscript  R  s       \sum_{R}\frac{1}{\dim(R)^{s}}   where the sum is over equivalence classes of irreducible representations R .  If Δ of rank r is a root system with n positive roots in Δ + and with simple roots λ i , the Witten zeta function of several variables is given by         ζ  W    (   s  1   ,  …  ,   s  n   )    =    ∑     m  1   ,  …  ,   m  r    >  0      ∏   α  ∈   Δ  +      1    (     α  ,    m  1    λ  1    +  ⋯  +    m  r    λ  r     )    s  α        ,         subscript  ζ  W     subscript  s  1   normal-…   subscript  s  n       subscript       subscript  m  1   normal-…   subscript  m  r    0      subscript  product    α   superscript  normal-Δ        1   superscript       superscript  α  normal-,    subscript  m  1    subscript  λ  1    normal-⋯     subscript  m  r    subscript  λ  r      subscript  s  α         \zeta_{W}(s_{1},\dots,s_{n})=\sum_{m_{1},\dots,m_{r}>0}\prod_{\alpha\in\Delta^%
 {+}}\frac{1}{(\alpha^{,}m_{1}\lambda_{1}+\cdots+m_{r}\lambda_{r})^{s_{\alpha}}},     The original zeta function studied by Witten differed from this slightly, in that all the numbers s α are equal, and the function is multiplied by a constant.  References      "  Category:Zeta and L-functions
