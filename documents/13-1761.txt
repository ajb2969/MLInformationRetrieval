Witten zeta function

In mathematics, the Witten zeta function, introduced by , is a function associated to a root system that encodes the degrees of the irreducible representations of the corresponding Lie group. It is a special case of the Shintani zeta function.
Definition
Witten's original definition of the zeta function of a semisimple Lie group was


 
  where the sum is over equivalence classes of irreducible representations R.
If Δ of rank r is a root system with n positive roots in Δ+ and with simple roots λi, the Witten zeta function of several variables is given by



The original zeta function studied by Witten differed from this slightly, in that all the numbers sα are equal, and the function is multiplied by a constant.
