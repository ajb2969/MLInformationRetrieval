   Euler's continued fraction formula      Euler's continued fraction formula   In the analytic theory of continued fractions , Euler's continued fraction formula is an identity connecting a certain very general infinite series with an infinite continued fraction. First published in 1748, it was at first regarded as a simple identity connecting a finite sum with a finite continued fraction in such a way that the extension to the infinite case was immediately apparent. 1 Today it is more fully appreciated as a useful tool in analytic attacks on the general convergence problem for infinite continued fractions with complex elements.  The original formula  Euler derived the formula as an identity connecting a finite sum of products with a finite continued fraction.        a  0   +    a  0    a  1    +    a  0    a  1    a  2    +  ⋯  +    a  0    a  1    a  2   ⋯   a  n     =     a  0    1  -     a  1     1  +   a  1    -     a  2     1  +   a  2    -    ⋱   ⋱     a   n  -  1      1  +   a   n  -  1     -     a  n    1  +   a  n                            subscript  a  0      subscript  a  0    subscript  a  1       subscript  a  0    subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2    normal-⋯     subscript  a  0    subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-⋯   subscript  a  n      continued-fraction   subscript  a  0     1   continued-fraction   subscript  a  1       1   subscript  a  1     continued-fraction   subscript  a  2       1   subscript  a  2     continued-fraction  normal-⋱    normal-⋱   continued-fraction   subscript  a    n  1        1   subscript  a    n  1      continued-fraction   subscript  a  n     1   subscript  a  n                 a_{0}+a_{0}a_{1}+a_{0}a_{1}a_{2}+\cdots+a_{0}a_{1}a_{2}\cdots a_{n}=\cfrac{a_{%

So if the series shown is convergent – or uniformly convergent, when the a i 's and b i 's are functions of some complex variable z – then the continued fractions also converge, or converge uniformly. 3  Examples  The exponential function  The exponential function e z is an entire function with a power series expansion that converges uniformly on every bounded domain in the complex plane.       e  z   =   1  +    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     z  n    n  !      =   1  +    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    (    ∏   j  =  1   n    z  j    )            superscript  e  z     1    superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript  z  n     n             1    superscript   subscript     n  1        superscript   subscript  product    j  1    n     z  j         e^{z}=1+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{n!}=1+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\prod_{%

The natural logarithm  The Taylor series for the principal branch of the natural logarithm in the neighborhood of z = 1 is well known. Recognizing that log( a / b ) = log( a ) - log( b ), the following series is easily derived:        log    1  +  z    1  -  z     =   2   (   z  +    z  3   3   +    z  5   5   +  ⋯   )    =   2    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     z    2  n   +  1      2  n   +  1       .              1  z     1  z       2    z     superscript  z  3   3      superscript  z  5   5   normal-⋯           2    superscript   subscript     n  0         superscript  z      2  n   1        2  n   1         \log\frac{1+z}{1-z}=2\left(z+\frac{z^{3}}{3}+\frac{z^{5}}{5}+\cdots\right)=2%
