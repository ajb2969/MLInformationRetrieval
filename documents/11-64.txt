(citrate (pro-3S)-lyase) ligase




(citrate (pro-3S)-lyase) ligase

In enzymology, a citrate (pro-3S)-lyase ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + acetate + citrate (pro-3S)-lyase(thiol form) 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + citrate (pro-3S)-lyase(acetyl form)
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, acetate, and citrate (pro-3S)-lyase(thiol form), whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and citrate (pro-3S)-lyase(acetyl form).
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetate:citrate (pro-3S)-lyase(thiol-form) ligase (AMP-forming). Other names in common use include citrate lyase ligase, citrate lyase synthetase, acetate: SH-acyl-carrier-protein enzyme ligase (AMP), acetate:HS-citrate lyase ligase, and acetate:citrate-(pro-3S)-lyase(thiol-form) ligase (AMP-forming). This enzyme participates in two-component system - general.
