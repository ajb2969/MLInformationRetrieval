The Douady rabbit is any of various particular filled Julia sets associated with the parameter near the center period 3 buds of Mandelbrot set for complex quadratic map.
Name
 Douady's rabbit or Douady rabbit is named for the French mathematician Adrien Douady.
Fat rabbit or chubby rabbit has c at the root of 1/3-limb of the Mandelbrot set. It has a parabolic fixed point with 3 petals.1
Forms of the complex quadratic map
There are two common forms for the complex quadratic map 
 
 
 
 . The first, also called the complex logistic map, is written as



where 
 
 
 
  is a complex variable and 
 
 
 
 
  is a complex parameter. The second common form is



Here 
 
 
 
  is a complex variable and 
 
 
 
  is a complex parameter. The variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are related by the equation



and the parameters 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are related by the equations



Note that 
 
 
 
 
  is invariant under the substitution 
 
 
 
 .
Mandelbrot and filled Julia sets
There are two planes associated with 
 
 
 
 . One of these, the 
 
 
 
  (or 
 
 
 
 ) plane, will be called the mapping plane, since 
 
 
 
 
  sends this plane into itself. The other, the 
 
 
 
  (or 
 
 
 
 ) plane, will be called the control plane.
The nature of what happens in the mapping plane under repeated application of 
 
 
 
  depends on where 
 
 
 
  (or 
 
 
 
 
 ) is in the control plane. The filled Julia set consists of all points in the mapping plane whose images remain bounded under indefinitely repeated applications of 
 
 
 
 . The Mandelbrot set consists of those points in the control plane such that the associated filled Julia set in the mapping plane is connected.
Figure 1 shows the Mandelbrot set when 
 
 
 
  is the control parameter, and Figure 2 shows the Mandelbrot set when 
 
 
 
  is the control parameter. Since 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are affine transformations of one another (a linear transformation plus a translation), the filled Julia sets look much the same in either the 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  planes.
The Douady rabbit
    The Douady rabbit is most easily described in terms of the Mandelbrot set as shown in Figure 1. In this figure, the Mandelbrot set, at least when viewed from a distance, appears as two back-to-back unit discs with sprouts. Consider the sprouts at the one- and five-o'clock positions on the right disk or the sprouts at the seven- and eleven-o'clock positions on the left disk. When 
 
 
 
  is within one of these four sprouts, the associated filled Julia set in the mapping plane is a Douady rabbit. For these values of 
 
 
 
 , it can be shown that 
 
 
 
 
  has 
 
 
 
  and one other point as unstable (repelling) fixed points, and 
 
 
 
  as an attracting fixed point. Moreover, the map 
 
 
 
  has three attracting fixed points. Douady's rabbit consists of the three attracting fixed points 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  and their basins of attraction.
For example, Figure 3 shows Douady's rabbit in the 
 
 
 
  plane when 
 
 
 
 , a point in the five-o'clock sprout of the right disk. For this value of 
 
 
 
 , the map 
 
 
 
 
  has the repelling fixed points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The three attracting fixed points of 
 
 
 
  (also called period-three fixed points) have the locations









The red, green, and yellow points lie in the basins 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 
 , respectively. The white points lie in the basin 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 .
The action of 
 
 
 
  on these fixed points is given by the relations









Corresponding to these relations there are the results









Note the marvelous fractal structure at the basin boundaries.

As a second example, Figure 4 shows a Douady rabbit when 
 
 
 
 , a point in the eleven-o'clock sprout on the left disk. (As noted earlier, 
 
 
 
  is invariant under this transformation.) The rabbit now sits more symmetrically on the page. The period-three fixed points are located at









The repelling fixed points of 
 
 
 
  itself are located at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The three major lobes on the left, which contain the period-three fixed points 
 
 
 
 
 ,
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , meet at the fixed point 
 
 
 
 , and their counterparts on the right meet at the point 
 
 
 
 . It can be shown that the effect of 
 
 
 
 
  on points near the origin consists of a counterclockwise rotation about the origin of 
 
 
 
 , or very nearly 
 
 
 
 , followed by scaling (dilation) by a factor of 
 
 
 
 .
