   Selberg sieve      Selberg sieve   In mathematics , in the field of number theory , the Selberg sieve is a technique for estimating the size of "sifted sets" of positive integers which satisfy a set of conditions which are expressed by congruences . It was developed by Atle Selberg in the 1940s.  Description  In terms of sieve theory the Selberg sieve is of combinatorial type : that is, derives from a careful use of the inclusion-exclusion principle . Selberg replaced the values of the Möbius function which arise in this by a system of weights which are then optimised to fit the given problem. The result gives an upper bound for the size of the sifted set.  Let A be a set of positive integers ≤ x and let P be a set of primes. For each p in P , let A p denote the set of elements of A divisible by p and extend this to let A d the intersection of the A p for p dividing d , when d is a product of distinct primes from P . Further let A 1 denote A itself. Let z be a positive real number and P ( z ) denote the product of the primes in P which are ≤ z . The object of the sieve is to estimate        S   (  A  ,  P  ,  z  )    =   |   A  ∖    ⋃   p  ∣  P   (  z  )      A  p     |    .        S   A  P  z        A    subscript    fragments  p  normal-∣  P   fragments  normal-(  z  normal-)      subscript  A  p        S(A,P,z)=\left|A\setminus\bigcup_{p\mid P(z)}A_{p}\right|.     We assume that | A d | may be estimated by        |   A  d   |   =     1   f   (  d  )     X   +   R  d     .         subscript  A  d          1    f  d    X    subscript  R  d      \left|A_{d}\right|=\frac{1}{f(d)}X+R_{d}.     where f is a multiplicative function and X =   | A |. Let the function g be obtained from f by Möbius inversion , that is       g   (  n  )    =    ∑   d  ∣  n     μ   (  d  )   f   (   n  /  d   )           g  n     subscript    fragments  d  normal-∣  n      μ  d  f    n  d       g(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}\mu(d)f(n/d)          f   (  n  )    =    ∑   d  ∣  n     g   (  d  )           f  n     subscript    fragments  d  normal-∣  n      g  d      f(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}g(d)     where μ is the Möbius function . Put        V   (  z  )    =    ∑      d  <  z        d  ∣  P   (  z  )           μ  2    (  d  )     g   (  d  )       .
