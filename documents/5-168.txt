   Taut foliation      Taut foliation   In mathematics , a taut foliation is a codimension 1 foliation of a 3-manifold with the property that there is a single transverse circle intersecting every leaf. By transverse circle, is meant a closed loop that is always transverse to the tangent field of the foliation. Equivalently, by a result of Dennis Sullivan , a codimension 1 foliation is taut if there exists a Riemannian metric that makes each leaf a minimal surface .  Taut foliations were brought to prominence by the work of William Thurston and David Gabai .  Related concepts  Taut foliations are closely related to the concept of Reebless foliation . A taut foliation cannot have a Reeb component , since the component would act like a "dead-end" from which a transverse curve could never escape; consequently, the boundary torus of the Reeb component has no transverse circle puncturing it. A Reebless foliation can fail to be taut but the only leaves of the foliation with no puncturing transverse circle must be compact, and in particular, homeomorphic to a torus.  Properties  The existence of a taut foliation implies various useful properties about a closed 3-manifold. For example, a closed, orientable 3-manifold, which admits a taut foliation with no sphere leaf, must be irreducible , covered by    ℝ  3     superscript  ℝ  3    \mathbb{R}^{3}   , and have negatively curved  fundamental group .  Rummler–Sullivan theorem  By a theorem of Rummler and Sullivan the following conditions are equivalent for transversely orientable codimension one foliations    (  M  ,  ℱ  )     M  ℱ    \left(M,{\mathcal{F}}\right)   of closed, orientable, smooth manifolds M:      ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   is taut;  there is a flow transverse to   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   which preserves some volume form on M;  there is a Riemannian metric on M for which the leaves of   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   are least area surfaces.
