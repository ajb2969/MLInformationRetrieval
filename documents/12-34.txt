   Bateman transform      Bateman transform   In the mathematical study of partial differential equations , the Bateman transform is a method for solving the Laplace equation in four dimensions and wave equation in three by using a line integral of a holomorphic function in three complex variables . It is named after the English mathematician Harry Bateman , who first published the result in .  The formula asserts that if ƒ is a holomorphic function of three complex variables, then       ϕ   (  w  ,  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    =    ∮  γ    f   (    (   w  +   i  x    )   +    (    i  y   +  z   )   ζ    ,    (    i  y   -  z   )   +    (   w  -   i  x    )   ζ    ,  ζ  )   d  ζ          ϕ   w  x  y  z      subscript  contour-integral  γ     f       w    i  x          i  y   z   ζ          i  y   z       w    i  x    ζ    ζ   d  ζ      \phi(w,x,y,z)=\oint_{\gamma}f\left((w+ix)+(iy+z)\zeta,(iy-z)+(w-ix)\zeta,\zeta%
 \right)\,d\zeta     is a solution of the Laplace equation, which follows by differentiation under the integral. Furthermore, Bateman asserted that the most general solution of the Laplace equation arises in this way.  References    .   .
