Draft:Ramification theory of local rings

Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite field extension. Let A be a normal local ring with 
 
 
 
 . Given a local ring B in L, we say "B lies over A" and "A lies below B" if B is the localization of A at some maximal ideal of the integral closure of A in L. In such a case, B is a normal local ring 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
 . The splitting group of B over A is defined as


 
  The inertia group of B over A is the kernel of 
 
 
 
 . Suppose the extension 
 
 
 
  is Galois. Then those two groups correspond to the fields 
 
 
 
  and then we also the corresponding local rings 
 
 
 
 .
