Mathematical coincidence

A mathematical coincidence is said to occur when two expressions show a near-equality which has no theoretical explanation.
For example, there is a near-equality close to the round number 1000 between powers of 2 and powers of 10:


Some mathematical coincidences are used in engineering when one expression is taken as an approximation of another.
Introduction
A mathematical coincidence often involves an integer, and the surprising (or "coincidental") feature is the fact that a real number arising in some context is considered by some standard as a "close" approximation to a small integer or to a multiple or power of ten, or more generally, to a rational number with a small denominator. Other kinds of mathematical coincidences, such as integers simultaneously satisfying multiple seemingly unrelated criteria or coincidences regarding units of measurement, may also be considered. In the class of those coincidences that are of a purely mathematical sort, some simply result from sometimes very deep mathematical facts, while others appear to come 'out of the blue'.
Given the countably infinite number of ways of forming mathematical expressions using a finite number of symbols, the number of symbols used and the precision of approximate equality might be the most obvious way to assess mathematical coincidences; but there is no standard, and the strong law of small numbers is the sort of thing one has to appeal to with no formal opposing mathematical guidance. Beyond this, some sense of mathematical aesthetics could be invoked to adjudicate the value of a mathematical coincidence, and there are in fact exceptional cases of true mathematical significance (see Ramanujan's constant below, which made it into print some years ago as a scientific April Fools' joke1). All in all, though, they are generally to be considered for their curiosity value or, perhaps, to encourage new mathematical learners at an elementary level.
Some examples
Rational approximants
Sometimes simple rational approximations are exceptionally close to interesting irrational values. These are explainable in terms of large terms in the continued fraction representation of the irrational value, but further insight into why such improbably large terms occur is often not available.
Rational approximants (convergents of continued fractions) to ratios of logs of different numbers are often invoked as well, making coincidences between the powers of those numbers.2
Many other coincidences are combinations of numbers that put them into the form that such rational approximants provide close relationships.
Concerning π

The first convergent of π, [3; 7] = 22/7 = 3.1428..., was known to Archimedes,3 and is correct to about 0.04%. The third convergent of π, [3; 7, 15, 1] = 355/113 = 3.1415929..., found by Zu Chongzhi,

 is correct to six decimal places;4 this high accuracy comes about because π has an unusually large next term in its continued fraction representation: π = [3; 7, 15, 1, 292, ...].5

A coincidence involving π and the golden ratio φ is given by 
 
 
 
 . This is related to Kepler triangles.
The Feynman point is a sequence of six 9s that begins at the 762nd decimal place of the decimal representation of pi. For a randomly chosen normal number, the probability of any chosen number sequence of six digits (including 6 of a number, 658 020, or the like) occurring this early in the decimal representation is only 0.08%. Pi is conjectured, but not known, to be a normal number.

Concerning base 2

The coincidence 
 
 
 
 , correct to 2.4%, relates to the rational approximation 
 
 
 
 , or 
 
 
 
  to within 0.3%. This relationship is used in engineering, for example to approximate a factor of two in power as 3 dB (actual is 3.0103 dB – see 3 dB-point), or to relate a kibibyte to a kilobyte; see binary prefix.67
This coincidence can also be expressed 
 
 
 
 , and is invoked for instance in shutter speed settings on cameras, as approximations to powers of two (128, 256, 512) in the sequence of speeds 125, 250, 500, etc.8

Concerning musical intervals

The coincidence 
 
 
 
 , from 
 
 
 
  leads to the observation commonly used in music to relate the tuning of 7 semitones of equal temperament to a perfect fifth of just intonation

 
 , correct to about 0.1%. The just fifth is the basis of Pythagorean tuning and most known systems of music. From the consequent approximation 
 
 
 
  it follows that the circle of fifths terminates seven octaves higher than the origin.9
The coincidence 
 
 
 
  leads to the rational version of 12-TET, as noted by Johann Kirnberger.
The coincidence 
 
 
 
  leads to the rational version of quarter-comma meantone temperament.
The coincidence 
 
 
 
  leads to the very tiny interval of 
 
 
 
  (about a millicent wide), which is the first 7-limit interval tempered out in 103169-TET.
The coincidence of powers of 2, above, leads to the approximation that three major thirds concatenate to an octave, 
 
 
 
 . This and similar approximations in music are called dieses.

Some plausible relations hold to a high degree of accuracy, but are nevertheless coincidental. One example is:

Numerical coincidences in numbers from the physical world
Length of Six Weeks
The number of seconds in six weeks, or 42 days, is exactly 10! (ten factorial) seconds. Many have recognized this coincidence in particular because of the importance of 42 in Douglas Adam's The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.
Speed of light
The speed of light is (by definition) exactly 299,792,458 m/s, very close to 300,000,000 m/s. This is a pure coincidence, as the meter was originally defined as 1/10,000,000 of the distance between the Earth's pole and equator along the surface at sea level, and the Earth's circumference just happens to be about 2/15 of a light-second.35 It is also roughly equal to one foot per nanosecond (the actual number is 0.9836 ft/ns). Another coincidence is that one lunar year (354 days) of acceleration with 1g gives speed of light: 9,8×354×24×3600=299,738,880.
Earth's diameter
The polar diameter of the Earth is equal to half a billion inches, to within 0.1%.36
Gravitational acceleration
While not constant but varying depending on latitude and altitude, the acceleration caused by Earth's gravity on the surface lies between 9.74 and 9.87, which is quite close to 10. This means that as a result of Newton's second law, the weight of a kilogram of mass on Earth's surface corresponds roughly to 10 newtons of force exerted on an object.37
This is actually related to the aforementioned coincidence that the square of pi is close to 10. One of the early definitions of the meter was the length of a pendulum whose half swing had a period equal to one second. Since the period of the full swing of a pendulum is approximated by the equation below, algebra shows that if this definition was maintained, gravitational acceleration measured in meters per second per second would be exactly equal to the square of pi.



When it was discovered that the circumference of the earth was very close to 40,000,000 times this value, the meter was redefined to reflect this, as it was a more objective standard. This had the effect of increasing the length of the meter by less than 1%, which was within the experimental error of the time.
Rydberg constant
The Rydberg constant, when multiplied by the speed of light and expressed as a frequency, is close to

Fine-structure constant

 .



Although this coincidence is not as strong as some of the others in this section, it is notable that 
 
 
 
  is a dimensionless constant, so this coincidence is not an artifact of the system of units being used.
