   Mathematical coincidence      Mathematical coincidence   A mathematical coincidence is said to occur when two expressions show a near-equality which has no theoretical explanation.  For example, there is a near-equality close to the round number  1000 between powers of 2 and powers of 10:    Some mathematical coincidences are used in engineering when one expression is taken as an approximation of another.  Introduction  A mathematical coincidence often involves an integer , and the surprising (or "coincidental") feature is the fact that a real number arising in some context is considered by some standard as a "close" approximation to a small integer or to a multiple or power of ten, or more generally, to a rational number with a small denominator . Other kinds of mathematical coincidences, such as integers simultaneously satisfying multiple seemingly unrelated criteria or coincidences regarding units of measurement, may also be considered. In the class of those coincidences that are of a purely mathematical sort, some simply result from sometimes very deep mathematical facts, while others appear to come 'out of the blue'.  Given the countably infinite number of ways of forming mathematical expressions using a finite number of symbols, the number of symbols used and the precision of approximate equality might be the most obvious way to assess mathematical coincidences; but there is no standard, and the strong law of small numbers is the sort of thing one has to appeal to with no formal opposing mathematical guidance. Beyond this, some sense of mathematical aesthetics could be invoked to adjudicate the value of a mathematical coincidence, and there are in fact exceptional cases of true mathematical significance (see Ramanujan's constant below, which made it into print some years ago as a scientific April Fools' joke 1 ). All in all, though, they are generally to be considered for their curiosity value or, perhaps, to encourage new mathematical learners at an elementary level.  Some examples  Rational approximants  Sometimes simple rational approximations are exceptionally close to interesting irrational values. These are explainable in terms of large terms in the continued fraction representation of the irrational value, but further insight into why such improbably large terms occur is often not available.  Rational approximants (convergents of continued fractions) to ratios of logs of different numbers are often invoked as well, making coincidences between the powers of those numbers. 2  Many other coincidences are combinations of numbers that put them into the form that such rational approximants provide close relationships.  Concerning π   The first convergent of π, [3; 7] = 22/7 = 3.1428..., was known to Archimedes , 3 and is correct to about 0.04%. The third convergent of π, [3; 7, 15, 1] = 355/113 = 3.1415929..., found by Zu Chongzhi ,   is correct to six decimal places; 4 this high accuracy comes about because π has an unusually large next term in its continued fraction representation: π = [3; 7, 15, 1, 292, ...]. 5   A coincidence involving π and the golden ratio φ is given by    π  ≈   4  /   φ    =   3.1446  …         π    4    φ           3.1446  normal-…      \pi\approx 4/\sqrt{\varphi}=3.1446\dots   . This is related to Kepler triangles .  The Feynman point is a sequence of six 9s that begins at the 762nd decimal place of the decimal representation of pi. For a randomly chosen normal number , the probability of any chosen number sequence of six digits (including 6 of a number, 658 020, or the like) occurring this early in the decimal representation is only 0.08%. Pi is conjectured, but not known, to be a normal number.   Concerning base 2   The coincidence     2  10   =  1024  ≈  1000  =   10  3          superscript  2  10   1024       1000        superscript  10  3      2^{10}=1024\approx 1000=10^{3}   , correct to 2.4%, relates to the rational approximation      log  10    log  2    ≈  3.3219  ≈   10  3             10     2    3.3219         10  3      \textstyle\frac{\log 10}{\log 2}\approx 3.3219\approx\frac{10}{3}   , or    2  ≈   10   3  /  10        2   superscript  10    3  10      2\approx 10^{3/10}   to within 0.3%. This relationship is used in engineering, for example to approximate a factor of two in power as 3 dB (actual is 3.0103 dB – see 3 dB-point ), or to relate a kibibyte to a kilobyte ; see binary prefix . 6 7  This coincidence can also be expressed     5  3   =  125  ≈  128  =   2  7          superscript  5  3   125       128        superscript  2  7      5^{3}=125\approx 128=2^{7}   , and is invoked for instance in shutter speed settings on cameras, as approximations to powers of two (128, 256, 512) in the sequence of speeds 125, 250, 500, etc. 8   Concerning musical intervals   The coincidence     2  19   ≈   3  12        superscript  2  19    superscript  3  12     2^{19}\approx 3^{12}   , from      log  3    log  2    ≈   1.5849  …   ≈   19  12             3     2      1.5849  normal-…          19  12      \frac{\log 3}{\log 2}\approx 1.5849\dots\approx\frac{19}{12}   leads to the observation commonly used in music to relate the tuning of 7 semitones of equal temperament to a perfect fifth of just intonation       2   7  /  12    ≈   3  /  2    ;       superscript  2    7  12      3  2     2^{7/12}\approx 3/2;   , correct to about 0.1%. The just fifth is the basis of Pythagorean tuning and most known systems of music. From the consequent approximation       (   3  /  2   )   12   ≈   2  7    ,       superscript    3  2   12    superscript  2  7     {(3/2)}^{12}\approx 2^{7},   it follows that the circle of fifths terminates seven octaves higher than the origin. 9  The coincidence      2  12    5  7    =   1.33333319  …   ≈   4  3              12   2      7   5      1.33333319  normal-…          4  3      \sqrt[12]{2}\sqrt[7]{5}=1.33333319\ldots\approx\frac{4}{3}   leads to the rational version of 12-TET , as noted by Johann Kirnberger .  The coincidence      5  8    35  3    =   4.00000559  …   ≈  4             8   5      3   35      4.00000559  normal-…        4     \sqrt[8]{5}\sqrt[3]{35}=4.00000559\ldots\approx 4   leads to the rational version of quarter-comma meantone temperament.  The coincidence      0.6  9    4.9  28    =   0.99999999754  …   ≈  1             9   0.6      28   4.9      0.99999999754  normal-…        1     \sqrt[9]{0.6}\sqrt[28]{4.9}=0.99999999754\ldots\approx 1   leads to the very tiny interval of     2  9    3   -  28     5  37    7   -  18         superscript  2  9    superscript  3    28     superscript  5  37    superscript  7    18      2^{9}3^{-28}5^{37}7^{-18}   (about a millicent wide), which is the first 7-limit interval tempered out in 103169-TET .  The coincidence of powers of 2, above, leads to the approximation that three major thirds concatenate to an octave,      (   5  /  4   )   3   ≈   2  /  1        superscript    5  4   3     2  1     {(5/4)}^{3}\approx{2/1}   . This and similar approximations in music are called dieses .   Numerical expressions  Concerning powers of pi         π  2   ≈  10   ;       superscript  π  2   10    \pi^{2}\approx 10;   correct to about 1.3%. 10 This can be understood in terms of the formula for the zeta function      ζ   (  2  )    =    π  2   /  6.         ζ  2      superscript  π  2   6.     \zeta(2)=\pi^{2}/6.    11 This coincidence was used in the design of slide rules , where the "folded" scales are folded on   π   π   \pi   rather than     10   ,      10    \sqrt{10},   because it is a more useful number and has the effect of folding the scales in about the same place.        π  2   ≈   227  /  23    ,       superscript  π  2     227  23     \pi^{2}\approx 227/23,   correct to 0.0004%. 12        π  3   ≈  31   ,       superscript  π  3   31    \pi^{3}\approx 31,   correct to 0.02%.          π  3   +  1   5   ≈  2   ,         5      superscript  π  3   1    2    \sqrt[5]{\pi^{3}+1}\approx 2,   correct to 0.004%.       π  ≈    (    9  2   +    19  2   22    )    1  /  4     ,      π   superscript     superscript  9  2      superscript  19  2   22      1  4      \pi\approx\left(9^{2}+\frac{19^{2}}{22}\right)^{1/4},   or      22   π  4    ≈  2143   ;        22   superscript  π  4    2143    22\pi^{4}\approx 2143;    13 accurate to 8 decimal places (due to Ramanujan : Quarterly Journal of Mathematics , XLV, 1914, pp. 350–372). Ramanujan states that this "curious approximation" to   π   π   \pi   was "obtained empirically" and has no connection with the theory developed in the remainder of the paper.   Some plausible relations hold to a high degree of accuracy, but are nevertheless coincidental. One example is:        ∫  0  ∞     cos   (   2  x   )      ∏   n  =  1   ∞     cos   (   x  n   )    d  x      ≈   π  8         superscript   subscript   0           2  x      superscript   subscript  product    n  1            x  n    d  x        π  8     \int_{0}^{\infty}\cos(2x)\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}\cos\left(\frac{x}{n}\right)dx%
 \approx\frac{\pi}{8}     The two sides of this expression only differ after the 42nd decimal place. 14  Containing both pi and e         π  4   +   π  5    ≈   e  6          superscript  π  4    superscript  π  5     superscript  e  6     \pi^{4}+\pi^{5}\approx e^{6}   , within 0.000 005% 15        3  3    e  π    4       4      superscript  3  3    superscript  e  π      \sqrt[4]{3^{3}e^{\pi}}   is very close to 5, within 0.008% (Andrew Fraker, 2014)        3    π  +  e   4    ≈  5        superscript  3      π  e   4    5    {3}^{\frac{\pi+e}{4}}\approx 5\quad   , is also very close to 5, approximately 0.000 538% error (Joseph Clarke, 2015)        e  π   -  π   ≈  19.99909998         superscript  e  π   π   19.99909998    e^{\pi}-\pi\approx 19.99909998   is very close to 20 (Conway, Sloane, Plouffe, 1988); this is equivalent to      (   π  +  20   )   i   =    -   0.9999999992  …    -    i  ⋅  0.000039   …    ≈   -  1          superscript    π  20   i         0.9999999992  normal-…       normal-⋅  i  0.000039   normal-…           1      (\pi+20)^{i}=-0.9999999992\ldots-i\cdot 0.000039\ldots\approx-1    16        π   3  2    /   e   2  3     =   9.9998  …   ≈  10           superscript  π   superscript  3  2     superscript  e   superscript  2  3       9.9998  normal-…        10     \pi^{3^{2}}/e^{2^{3}}=9.9998\ldots\approx 10    17   Containing pi or e and 163        163  ⋅   (   π  -  e   )    ≈  69       normal-⋅  163    π  e    69    {163}\cdot(\pi-e)\approx 69   , [ http://www.google.com/search?q=100*(163*(pi-e)%2F69-1 ) within 0.0005%] 18       163   ln  163    ≈   2  5         163    163     superscript  2  5     \frac{163}{\ln 163}\approx 2^{5}   , [ http://www.google.com/search?q=100*((163/ln(163) )^(1/5)%2F2-1) within 0.000004%] 19  Ramanujan's constant      e   π   163     ≈     (    2  6   ⋅  10005   )   3   +  744        superscript  e    π    163        superscript   normal-⋅   superscript  2  6   10005   3   744     e^{\pi\sqrt{163}}\approx(2^{6}\cdot 10005)^{3}+744   , within    2.9  ⋅    10   -  28    %      normal-⋅  2.9   percent   superscript  10    28       2.9\cdot 10^{-28}\%   , discovered in 1859 by Charles Hermite . 20 This very close approximation is not a typical sort of accidental mathematical coincidence, where no mathematical explanation is known or expected to exist (as is the case for most others here). It is a consequence of the fact that 163 is a Heegner number .

(ten factorial) seconds. Many have recognized this coincidence in particular because of the importance of 42 in Douglas Adam's  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.  Speed of light  The speed of light is (by definition) exactly 299,792,458 m/s, very close to 300,000,000 m/s. This is a pure coincidence, as the meter was originally defined as 1/10,000,000 of the distance between the Earth's pole and equator along the surface at sea level, and the Earth's circumference just happens to be about 2/15 of a light-second. 35 It is also roughly equal to one foot per nanosecond (the actual number is 0.9836 ft/ns). Another coincidence is that one lunar year (354 days) of acceleration with 1g gives speed of light: 9,8×354×24×3600=299,738,880.  Earth's diameter  The polar diameter of the Earth is equal to half a billion inches, to within 0.1%. 36  Gravitational acceleration  While not constant but varying depending on latitude and altitude , the acceleration caused by Earth's gravity on the surface lies between 9.74 and 9.87, which is quite close to 10. This means that as a result of Newton's second law , the weight of a kilogram of mass on Earth's surface corresponds roughly to 10 newtons of force exerted on an object. 37  This is actually related to the aforementioned coincidence that the square of pi is close to 10. One of the early definitions of the meter was the length of a pendulum whose half swing had a period equal to one second. Since the period of the full swing of a pendulum is approximated by the equation below, algebra shows that if this definition was maintained, gravitational acceleration measured in meters per second per second would be exactly equal to the square of pi.      T  ≈   2  π    L  g         T    2  π      L  g       T\approx 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}     When it was discovered that the circumference of the earth was very close to 40,000,000 times this value, the meter was redefined to reflect this, as it was a more objective standard. This had the effect of increasing the length of the meter by less than 1%, which was within the experimental error of the time.  Rydberg constant  The Rydberg constant , when multiplied by the speed of light and expressed as a frequency, is close to       π  2   3   ×   10  15    Hz           superscript  π  2   3    superscript  10  15    Hz    \frac{\pi^{2}}{3}\times 10^{15}\text{Hz}   : 38          3.2898  ¯   41960364   (  17  )    ×   10  15    Hz   =    R  ∞   c              normal-¯  3.2898   41960364  17    superscript  10  15    Hz      subscript  R    c     \underline{3.2898}41960364(17)\times 10^{15}\text{Hz}=R_{\infty}c    39        3.2898  ¯   68133696...   =    π  2   3          normal-¯  3.2898   68133696...      superscript  π  2   3     \underline{3.2898}68133696...=\frac{\pi^{2}}{3}     Fine-structure constant  The Fine-structure constant    α   α   \alpha   is close to    1  137      1  137    \frac{1}{137}   and was once conjectured to be precisely    1  137      1  137    \frac{1}{137}   .      α  =   1   137.035999074  …        α    1    137.035999074  normal-…      \alpha=\frac{1}{137.035999074\dots}     Although this coincidence is not as strong as some of the others in this section, it is notable that   α   α   \alpha   is a dimensionless constant , so this coincidence is not an artifact of the system of units being used.
