   Stable polynomial      Stable polynomial   A polynomial is said to be stable if either:   all its roots lie in the open left half-plane , or  all its roots lie in the open  unit disk .   The first condition provides stability for (or continuous-time ) linear systems, and the second case relates to stability of discrete-time linear systems. A polynomial with the first property is called at times a Hurwitz polynomial and with the second property a Schur polynomial . Stable polynomials arise in control theory and in mathematical theory of differential and difference equations. A linear, time-invariant system (see LTI system theory ) is said to be BIBO stable if every bounded input produces bounded output. A linear system is BIBO stable if its characteristic polynomial is stable. The denominator is required to be Hurwitz stable if the system is in continuous-time and Schur stable if it is in discrete-time. In practice, stability is determined by applying any one of several stability criteria .  Properties   The Routh-Hurwitz theorem provides an algorithm for determining if a given polynomial is Hurwitz stable, which is implemented in the Routh–Hurwitz and Liénard–Chipart tests.    To test if a given polynomial P (of degree d ) is Schur stable, it suffices to apply this theorem to the transformed polynomial        Q   (  z  )    =     (   z  -  1   )   d   P   (    z  +  1    z  -  1    )          Q  z      superscript    z  1   d   P      z  1     z  1       Q(z)=(z-1)^{d}P\left({{z+1}\over{z-1}}\right)     obtained after the Möbius transformation     z  ↦    z  +  1    z  -  1       maps-to  z      z  1     z  1      z\mapsto{{z+1}\over{z-1}}   which maps the left half-plane to the open unit disc: P is Schur stable if and only if Q is Hurwitz stable and     P   (  1  )    ≠  0        P  1   0    P(1)\neq 0   . For higher degree polynomials the extra computation involved in this mapping can be avoided by testing the Schur stability by the Schur-Cohn test, the Jury test or the Bistritz test .   Necessary condition: a Hurwitz stable polynomial (with real coefficients) has coefficients of the same sign (either all positive or all negative).    Sufficient condition: a polynomial     f   (  z  )    =    a  0   +    a  1   z   +  ⋯  +    a  n    z  n           f  z      subscript  a  0      subscript  a  1   z   normal-⋯     subscript  a  n    superscript  z  n       f(z)=a_{0}+a_{1}z+\cdots+a_{n}z^{n}   with (real) coefficients such that:         a  n   >   a   n  -  1    >  ⋯  >   a  0   >  0   ,         subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  1         normal-⋯        subscript  a  0        0     a_{n}>a_{n-1}>\cdots>a_{0}>0,   is Schur stable.   Product rule: Two polynomials f and g are stable (of the same type) if and only if the product fg is stable.   Examples        4   z  3    +   3   z  2    +   2  z   +  1        4   superscript  z  3      3   superscript  z  2      2  z   1    4z^{3}+3z^{2}+2z+1   is Schur stable because it satisfies the sufficient condition;      z  10     superscript  z  10    z^{10}   is Schur stable (because all its roots equal 0) but it does not satisfy the sufficient condition;       z  2   -  z  -  2       superscript  z  2   z  2    z^{2}-z-2   is not Hurwitz stable (its roots are -1,2) because it violates the necessary condition;       z  2   +   3  z   +  2       superscript  z  2     3  z   2    z^{2}+3z+2   is Hurwitz stable (its roots are -1,-2).  The polynomial     z  4   +   z  3   +   z  2   +  z  +  1       superscript  z  4    superscript  z  3    superscript  z  2   z  1    z^{4}+z^{3}+z^{2}+z+1   (with positive coefficients) is neither Hurwitz stable nor Schur stable. Its roots are the four primitive fifth roots of unity           z  k   =    cos   (    2  π  k   5   )    +   i   sin   (    2  π  k   5   )       ,   k  =   1  ,  …  ,  4 .       formulae-sequence     subscript  z  k           2  π  k   5      i        2  π  k   5         k   1  normal-…  4 .      z_{k}=\cos\left({{2\pi k}\over 5}\right)+i\sin\left({{2\pi k}\over 5}\right),%
 \,k=1,\ldots,4\ .         Note here that     \cos({{2\pi}/5})={{\sqrt{5}-1}\over 4}>0.       It is a "boundary case" for Schur stability because its roots lie on the unit circle. The example also shows that the necessary (positivity) conditions stated above for Hurwitz stability are not sufficient.
