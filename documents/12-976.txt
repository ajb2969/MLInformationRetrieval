   Prandtl–Glauert transformation      Prandtl–Glauert transformation   The Prandtl–Glauert transformation is a mathematical technique which allows solving certain compressible flow problems by incompressible-flow calculation methods. It also allows applying incompressible-flow data to compressible-flow cases.

It can be solved by incompressible methods, such as thin airfoil theory, vortex lattice methods, panel methods, etc. The result is the transformed perturbation potential    ϕ  ¯     normal-¯  ϕ    \bar{\phi}   or its gradient components      ϕ  ¯    x  ¯    ,    ϕ  ¯    y  ¯    ,    ϕ  ¯    z  ¯        subscript   normal-¯  ϕ    normal-¯  x     subscript   normal-¯  ϕ    normal-¯  y     subscript   normal-¯  ϕ    normal-¯  z      \bar{\phi}_{\bar{x}},\bar{\phi}_{\bar{y}},\bar{\phi}_{\bar{z}}   in the transformed space. The physical linearized pressure coefficient is then obtained by the inverse transformation        C  p    =   -   2     ϕ  x    V  ∞       =   -    2   β  2       ϕ  ¯    x  ¯     V  ∞             subscript  C  p       2     subscript  ϕ  x    subscript  V                  2   superscript  β  2       subscript   normal-¯  ϕ    normal-¯  x     subscript  V          C_{p}\;=\;-2\frac{\phi_{x}}{V_{\infty}}\;=\;-\frac{2}{\beta^{2}}\frac{\bar{%
 \phi}_{\bar{x}}}{V_{\infty}}     which is known as Göthert's Rule 3  Results  For two-dimensional flow , the net result is that the    C  p     subscript  C  p    C_{p}   and also the lift and moment coefficients     c  l   ,   c  m       subscript  c  l    subscript  c  m     c_{l},c_{m}   are increased by the factor    1  /  β      1  β    1/\beta   over the incompressible-flow values:         C  p       =    C   p  0    β          c  l       =    c   l  0    β          c  m       =    c   m  0    β            subscript  C  p     absent     subscript  C    p  0    β     missing-subexpression      subscript  c  l     absent     subscript  c    l  0    β     missing-subexpression      subscript  c  m     absent     subscript  c    m  0    β     missing-subexpression      \begin{array}[]{rcl}C_{p}&=\displaystyle\frac{C_{p0}}{\beta}\\
 c_{l}&=\displaystyle\frac{c_{l0}}{\beta}\\
 c_{m}&=\displaystyle\frac{c_{m0}}{\beta}\end{array}     where     C   p  0    ,   c   l  0    ,   c   m  0        subscript  C    p  0     subscript  c    l  0     subscript  c    m  0      C_{p0},c_{l0},c_{m0}   are the incompressible-flow values. This 2D-only result is known as the Prandtl Rule. 4  For three-dimensional flows , these simple    1  /  β      1  β    1/\beta   scalings do NOT apply. Instead, it is necessary to scale the xyz geometry as given above, and use the Göthert's Rule to compute the    C  p     subscript  C  p    C_{p}   and subsequently the forces and moments. No simple results are possible, except in special cases. For example, using Lifting-Line Theory for a flat elliptical wing, the lift coefficient is       C  L   =    2  π  α    β  +    2  /  A   R          subscript  C  L       2  π  α     β      2  A   R       C_{L}=\frac{2\pi\alpha}{\beta+2/AR}     where AR is the wing's aspect ratio. Note that in the 2D case where AR → ∞ this reduces to the 2D case, since in incompressible 2D flow for a flat airfoil we have     c   l  0    =   2  π  α        subscript  c    l  0      2  π  α     c_{l0}=2\pi\alpha   , as given by Thin airfoil theory .  Limitations  The PG transformation works well for all freestream Mach numbers up 0.7 or so, or once transonic flow starts to appear. 5  History  Ludwig Prandtl had been teaching this transformation in his lectures for a while, however the first publication was in 1928 by Hermann Glauert . 6 The introduction of this relation allowed the design of aircraft which were able to operate in higher subsonic speed areas. 7 Originally all these results were developed for 2D flow. B.H. Göthert 8 then pointed out that the geometry distortion of the PG transformation renders the simple 2D Prandtl Rule invalid for 3D, and properly stated the full 3D problem as described above.  The PG transformation was extended by Jakob Ackeret to supersonic-freestream flows. Like for the subsonic case, the supersonic case is valid only if there are no transonic effect, which requires that the body be slender and the freestream Mach is sufficiently far above unity.  Singularity  Near the sonic speed     M  ∞   ≃  1     similar-to-or-equals   subscript  M    1    M_{\infty}\simeq 1   the PG transformation features a singularity . The singularity is also called the Prandtl–Glauert singularity , and the flow resistance is calculated to approach infinity. In reality, aerodynamic and thermodynamic perturbations get amplified strongly near the sonic speed, but a singularity does not occur. An explanation for this is that the linearized small-disturbance potential equation above is not valid, since it assumes that there are only small variations in Mach number within the flow and absence of compression shocks and thus is missing certain nonlinear terms. However, these become relevant as soon as any part of the flow field accelerates above the speed of sound, and become essential near     M  ∞   ≃  1     similar-to-or-equals   subscript  M    1    M_{\infty}\simeq 1   . The more correct nonlinear equation does not exhibit the singularity.
