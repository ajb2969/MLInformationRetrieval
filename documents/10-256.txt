   Super-prime      Super-prime   Super-prime numbers (also known as " higher order primes ") are the subsequence of prime numbers that occupy prime-numbered positions within the sequence of all prime numbers. The subsequence begins   3, 5, 11, 17, 31, 41, 59, 67, 83, 109, 127, 157, … .   That is, if p ( i ) denotes the i th prime number, the numbers in this sequence are those of the form p ( p ( i )).  used a computer-aided proof (based on calculations involving the subset sum problem ) to show that every integer greater than 96 may be represented as a sum of distinct super-prime numbers. Their proof relies on a result resembling Bertrand's postulate , stating that (after the larger gap between super-primes 5 and 11) each super-prime number is less than twice its predecessor in the sequence.  Broughan and Barnett 1 show that there are       x    (   log  x   )   2    +   O   (    x   log   log  x       (   log  x   )   3    )          x   superscript    x   2      O      x      x      superscript    x   3       \frac{x}{(\log x)^{2}}+O\left(\frac{x\log\log x}{(\log x)^{3}}\right)   super-primes up to x . This can be used to show that the set of all super-primes is small .  One can also define "higher-order" primeness much the same way, and obtain analogous sequences of primes.  A variation on this theme is the sequence of prime numbers with palindromic prime indices, beginning with   3, 5, 11, 17, 31, 547, 739, 877, 1087, 1153, 2081, 2381, ... .   References      .   .
