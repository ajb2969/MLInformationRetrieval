   Consistency      Consistency   In classical  deductive  logic , a consistent  theory is one that does not contain a contradiction . 1 2 The lack of contradiction can be defined in either semantic or syntactic terms. The semantic definition states that a theory is consistent if and only if it has a model , i.e. there exists an interpretation under which all formulas in the theory are true. This is the sense used in traditional Aristotelian logic , although in contemporary mathematical logic the term satisfiable is used instead. The syntactic definition states that a theory is consistent if and only if there is no formula  P such that both P and its negation are provable from the axioms of the theory under its associated deductive system.  If these semantic and syntactic definitions are equivalent for any theory formulated using a particular deductive logic , the logic is called complete . The completeness of the sentential calculus was proved by Paul Bernays in 1918 3 and Emil Post in 1921, 4 while the completeness of predicate calculus was proved by Kurt Gödel in 1930, 5 and consistency proofs for arithmetics restricted with respect to the induction axiom schema were proved by Ackermann (1924), von Neumann (1927) and Herbrand (1931). 6 Stronger logics, such as second-order logic , are not complete.  A consistency proof is a mathematical proof that a particular theory is consistent. The early development of mathematical proof theory was driven by the desire to provide finitary consistency proofs for all of mathematics as part of Hilbert's program . Hilbert's program was strongly impacted by incompleteness theorems , which showed that sufficiently strong proof theories cannot prove their own consistency (provided that they are in fact consistent).  Although consistency can be proved by means of model theory, it is often done in a purely syntactical way, without any need to reference some model of the logic. The cut-elimination (or equivalently the normalization of the underlying calculus if there is one) implies the consistency of the calculus: since there is obviously no cut-free proof of falsity, there is no contradiction in general.  Consistency and completeness in arithmetic and set theory  In theories of arithmetic, such as Peano arithmetic , there is an intricate relationship between the consistency of the theory and its completeness . A theory is complete if, for every formula φ in its language, at least one of φ or ¬ φ is a logical consequence of the theory.  Presburger arithmetic is an axiom system for the natural numbers under addition. It is both consistent and complete.  Gödel's incompleteness theorems show that any sufficiently strong effective theory of arithmetic cannot be both complete and consistent. Gödel's theorem applies to the theories of Peano arithmetic (PA) and Primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA), but not to Presburger arithmetic .  Moreover, Gödel's second incompleteness theorem shows that the consistency of sufficiently strong effective theories of arithmetic can be tested in a particular way. Such a theory is consistent if and only if it does not prove a particular sentence, called the Gödel sentence of the theory, which is a formalized statement of the claim that the theory is indeed consistent. Thus the consistency of a sufficiently strong, effective, consistent theory of arithmetic can never be proven in that system itself. The same result is true for effective theories that can describe a strong enough fragment of arithmetic – including set theories such as Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory . These set theories cannot prove their own Gödel sentences – provided that they are consistent, which is generally believed.  Because consistency of ZF is not provable in ZF, the weaker notion relative consistency is interesting in set theory (and in other sufficiently expressive axiomatic systems). If T is a theory and A is an additional axiom , T + A is said to be consistent relative to T (or simply that A is consistent with T ) if it can be proved that if T is consistent then T + A is consistent. If both A and ¬ A are consistent with T , then A is said to be independent of T .  First-order logic  Notation  ⊢ (Turnstile symbol) in the following context of Mathematical logic , means "provable from". That is, a ⊢ b reads: b is provable from a (in some specified formal system) -- see List of logic symbols ) . In other cases, the turnstile symbol may stand to mean infers; derived from. See: List of mathematical symbols .  Definition  A set of formulas    Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   in first-order logic is consistent (written Con   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   ) if and only if there is no formula   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   such that    Φ  ⊢  ϕ     proves  normal-Φ  ϕ    \Phi\vdash\phi   and    Φ  ⊢   ¬  ϕ      proves  normal-Φ     ϕ     \Phi\vdash\lnot\phi   . Otherwise   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is inconsistent and is written Inc   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   .     Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is said to be simply consistent  if and only if for no formula   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   of   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   , both   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   and the negation of   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   are theorems of   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   .     Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is said to be absolutely consistent or Post consistent if and only if at least one formula of   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is not a theorem of   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   .     Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is said to be maximally consistent if and only if for every formula   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   , if Con (    Φ  ∪  ϕ      normal-Φ  ϕ    \Phi\cup\phi   ) then    ϕ  ∈  Φ      ϕ  normal-Φ    \phi\in\Phi   .     Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is said to contain witnesses if and only if for every formula of the form    ∃   x  ϕ         x  ϕ     \exists x\phi   there exists a term   t   t   t   such that     (  ∃  x  ϕ  →  ϕ   t  x   )   ∈  Φ     fragments   fragments  normal-(   x  ϕ  normal-→  ϕ    t  x   normal-)    Φ    (\exists x\phi\to\phi{t\over x})\in\Phi   . See First-order logic .  Basic results   The following are equivalent:  Inc   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi     For all      ϕ  ,  Φ   ⊢  ϕ   .     proves   ϕ  normal-Φ   ϕ    \phi,\;\Phi\vdash\phi.      Every satisfiable set of formulas is consistent, where a set of formulas   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is satisfiable if and only if there exists a model   ℑ   ℑ   \mathfrak{I}   such that    ℑ  ⊨  Φ     normal-⊨  ℑ  normal-Φ    \mathfrak{I}\vDash\Phi   .

Henkin's theorem  Let   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   be a maximally consistent set of   S   S   S   -formulas containing witnesses .  Define a binary relation   ∼   similar-to   \sim   on the set of   S   S   S   -terms such that     t  0   ∼   t  1      similar-to   subscript  t  0    subscript  t  1     t_{0}\sim t_{1}   if and only if      t   0   ≡   t  1   ∈  Φ         subscript  t  0    subscript  t  1        normal-Φ     \;t_{0}\equiv t_{1}\in\Phi   ; and let     t  ¯      normal-¯  t    \overline{t}\!   denote the equivalence class of terms containing    t    t   t\!   ; and let     T  Φ   :=   {    t  ¯    |   t  ∈   T  S    }      assign   subscript  T  normal-Φ    conditional-set   normal-¯  t     t   superscript  T  S       T_{\Phi}:=\{\;\overline{t}\;|\;t\in T^{S}\}   where     T  S      superscript  T  S    T^{S}\!   is the set of terms based on the symbol set    S    S   S\!   .  Define the   S   S   S   -structure    𝔗  Φ     subscript  𝔗  normal-Φ    \mathfrak{T}_{\Phi}   over     T  Φ      subscript  T  normal-Φ    T_{\Phi}\!   the term-structure corresponding to   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   by:   for   n   n   n   -ary    R  ∈  S      R  S    R\in S   ,     R   𝔗  Φ      t  0   ¯   …    t   n  -  1    ¯        superscript  R   subscript  𝔗  normal-Φ     normal-¯   subscript  t  0    normal-…   normal-¯   subscript  t    n  1       R^{\mathfrak{T}_{\Phi}}\overline{t_{0}}\ldots\overline{t_{n-1}}   if and only if      R    t  0   …   t   n  -  1     ∈  Φ        R   subscript  t  0   normal-…   subscript  t    n  1     normal-Φ    \;Rt_{0}\ldots t_{n-1}\in\Phi   ;  for   n   n   n   -ary    f  ∈  S      f  S    f\in S   ,      f   𝔗  Φ     (     t  0   ¯   …    t   n  -  1    ¯    )    :=    f   t  0   …   t   n  -  1     ¯      assign     superscript  f   subscript  𝔗  normal-Φ       normal-¯   subscript  t  0    normal-…   normal-¯   subscript  t    n  1        normal-¯    f   subscript  t  0   normal-…   subscript  t    n  1        f^{\mathfrak{T}_{\Phi}}(\overline{t_{0}}\ldots\overline{t_{n-1}}):=\overline{%

Let     ℑ  Φ   :=   (   𝔗  Φ   ,   β  Φ   )      assign   subscript  ℑ  normal-Φ     subscript  𝔗  normal-Φ    subscript  β  normal-Φ      \mathfrak{I}_{\Phi}:=(\mathfrak{T}_{\Phi},\beta_{\Phi})   be the term interpretation associated with   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   , where      β  Φ    (  x  )    :=   x  ¯      assign     subscript  β  normal-Φ   x    normal-¯  x     \beta_{\Phi}(x):=\bar{x}   .   For all   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   ,      ℑ   Φ   ⊨  ϕ     normal-⊨   subscript  ℑ  normal-Φ   ϕ    \;\mathfrak{I}_{\Phi}\vDash\phi   if and only if     ϕ   ∈  Φ      ϕ  normal-Φ    \;\phi\in\Phi   .   Sketch of proof  There are several things to verify. First, that   ∼   similar-to   \sim   is an equivalence relation . Then, it needs to be verified that (1), (2), and (3) are well defined. This falls out of the fact that   ∼   similar-to   \sim   is an equivalence relation and also requires a proof that (1) and (2) are independent of the choice of     t  0   ,  …  ,   t   n  -  1        subscript  t  0   normal-…   subscript  t    n  1      t_{0},\ldots,t_{n-1}   class representatives. Finally,     ℑ  Φ   ⊨  Φ     normal-⊨   subscript  ℑ  normal-Φ   normal-Φ    \mathfrak{I}_{\Phi}\vDash\Phi   can be verified by induction on formulas.

This definition requires a notion of "proof". Gödel in his 1931 defines the notion this way: "The class of provable formulas is defined to be the smallest class of formulas that contains the axioms and is closed under the relation "immediate consequence", i.e. formula c of a and b is defined as an immediate consequence in terms of modus ponens or substitution; cf Gödel 1931 van Heijenoort 1967:601. Tarski defines "proof" informally as "statements follow one another in a definite order according to certain principles . . . and accompanied by considerations intended to establish their validity[true conclusion for all true premises -- Reichenbach 1947:68]" cf Tarski 1946:3. Kleene 1952 defines the notion with respect to either an induction or as to paraphrase) a finite sequence of formulas such that each formula in the sequence is either an axiom or an "immediate consequence" of the preceding formulas; "A ''proof is said to be a proof of its last formula, and this formula is said to be (formally) provable or be a ''(formal) theorem" cf Kleene 1952:83. ↩  Paraconsistent logic  tolerates contradictions, but toleration of contradiction does not entail consistency. ↩  van Heijenoort 1967:265 states that Bernays determined the independence of the axioms of Principia Mathematica , a result not published until 1926, but he says nothing about Bernays proving their consistency . ↩  Post proves both consistency and completeness of the propositional calculus of PM, cf van Heijenoort's commentary and Post's 1931 Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositons in van Heijenoort 1967:264ff.
