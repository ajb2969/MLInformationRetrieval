Du Bois singularity

In algebraic geometry, Du Bois singularities are singularities of complex varieties studied by .
gave the following characterisation of Du Bois singularities. Suppose that 
 
 
 
  is a reduced closed subscheme of a smooth scheme

 
 .
Take a log resolution 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  that is an isomorphism outside 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be the reduced preimage of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  has Du Bois singularities if and only if the induced map 
 
 
 
  is a quasi-isomorphism.
