   Du Bois singularity      Du Bois singularity   In algebraic geometry , Du Bois singularities are singularities of complex varieties studied by .  gave the following characterisation of Du Bois singularities. Suppose that   X   X   X   is a reduced closed subscheme of a smooth scheme    Y   Y   Y   .  Take a log resolution    π  :   Z  →  X      normal-:  π   normal-→  Z  X     \pi:Z\to X   of   X   X   X   in   Y   Y   Y   that is an isomorphism outside   X   X   X   , and let   E   E   E   be the reduced preimage of   X   X   X   in   Z   Z   Z   . Then   X   X   X   has Du Bois singularities if and only if the induced map     𝒪  X   →   R   π  *    𝒪  E       normal-→   subscript  𝒪  X     R   subscript  π     subscript  𝒪  E      \mathcal{O}_{X}\to R\pi_{*}\mathcal{O}_{E}   is a quasi-isomorphism .
