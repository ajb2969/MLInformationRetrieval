Straightening theorem for vector fields

In differential calculus, the domain-straightening theorem states that, given a vector field

 
  on a manifold, there exist local coordinates 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  in a neighborhood of a point where 
 
 
 
  is nonzero. The theorem is also known as straightening out of a vector field.
The Frobenius theorem in differential geometry can be considered as a higher-dimensional generalization of this theorem.
Proof
It is clear that we only have to find such coordinates at 0 in 
 
 
 
 . First we write 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is some coordinate system at 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
 . By linear change of coordinates, we can assume 
 
 
 
  Let 
 
 
 
  be the solution of the initial value problem 
 
 
 
  and let



 
  (and thus 
 
 
 
 ) is smooth by smooth dependence on initial conditions in ordinary differential equations. It follows that


 
 , and, since 
 
 
 
 , the differential 
 
 
 
  is the identity at 
 
 
 
 . Thus, 
 
 
 
  is a coordinate system at 
 
 
 
 . Finally, since 
 
 
 
 , we have
 
 
 
  and so 
 
 
 
  as required.
