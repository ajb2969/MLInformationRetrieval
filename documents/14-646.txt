   Straightening theorem for vector fields      Straightening theorem for vector fields   In differential calculus , the domain-straightening theorem states that, given a vector field    X   X   X   on a manifold , there exist local coordinates     y  1   ,  …  ,   y  n       subscript  y  1   normal-…   subscript  y  n     y_{1},\dots,y_{n}   such that    X  =   ∂  /   ∂   y  1         X        subscript  y  1       X=\partial/\partial y_{1}   in a neighborhood of a point where   X   X   X   is nonzero. The theorem is also known as straightening out of a vector field .  The Frobenius theorem in differential geometry can be considered as a higher-dimensional generalization of this theorem.  Proof  It is clear that we only have to find such coordinates at 0 in    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   . First we write    X  =    ∑  j     f  j    (  x  )    ∂   ∂   x  j           X    subscript   j      subscript  f  j   x        subscript  x  j         X=\sum_{j}f_{j}(x){\partial\over\partial x_{j}}   where   x   x   x   is some coordinate system at   0   0    . Let    f  =   (   f  1   ,  …  ,   f  n   )       f    subscript  f  1   normal-…   subscript  f  n      f=(f_{1},\dots,f_{n})   . By linear change of coordinates, we can assume      f   (  0  )    =   (  1  ,  0  ,  …  ,  0  )    .        f  0    1  0  normal-…  0     f(0)=(1,0,\dots,0).   Let    Φ   (  t  ,  p  )       normal-Φ   t  p     \Phi(t,p)   be the solution of the initial value problem      x  ˙   =   f   (  x  )     ,    x   (  0  )    =  p      formulae-sequence     normal-˙  x     f  x        x  0   p     \dot{x}=f(x),x(0)=p   and let        ψ   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =   Φ   (   x  1   ,   (  0  ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )   )     .        ψ    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n       normal-Φ    subscript  x  1    0   subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n        \psi(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})=\Phi(x_{1},(0,x_{2},\dots,x_{n})).      Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   (and thus   ψ   ψ   \psi   ) is smooth by smooth dependence on initial conditions in ordinary differential equations. It follows that        ∂   ∂   x  1     ψ   (  x  )    =   f   (   ψ   (  x  )    )                subscript  x  1     ψ  x     f    ψ  x      {\partial\over\partial x_{1}}\psi(x)=f(\psi(x))   , and, since     ψ   (  0  ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =   Φ   (  0  ,   (  0  ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )   )    =   (  0  ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )           ψ   0   subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n       normal-Φ   0   0   subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n            0   subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n       \psi(0,x_{2},\dots,x_{n})=\Phi(0,(0,x_{2},\dots,x_{n}))=(0,x_{2},\dots,x_{n})   , the differential    d  ψ      d  ψ    d\psi   is the identity at   0   0    . Thus,    y  =    ψ   -  1     (  x  )        y     superscript  ψ    1    x     y=\psi^{-1}(x)   is a coordinate system at   0   0    . Finally, since    x  =   ψ   (  y  )        x    ψ  y     x=\psi(y)   , we have      ∂   x  j     ∂   y  1     =    f  j    (   ψ   (  y  )    )    =    f  j    (  x  )               subscript  x  j       subscript  y  1        subscript  f  j     ψ  y            subscript  f  j   x      {\partial x_{j}\over\partial y_{1}}=f_{j}(\psi(y))=f_{j}(x)   and so     ∂   ∂   y  1     =  X            subscript  y  1     X    {\partial\over\partial y_{1}}=X   as required.
