Histogram matching

 Histogram matching is a method in image processing of color adjustment of two images using the image histograms.
It is possible to use histogram matching to balance detector responses as a relative detector calibration technique. It can be used to normalize two images, when the images were acquired at the same local illumination (such as shadows) over the same location, but by different sensors, atmospheric conditions or global illumination.
The algorithm
Given two images, the reference and the adjusted images, we compute their histograms. Following, we calculate the cumulative distribution functions of the two images' histograms - 
 
 
 
  for the reference image and 
 
 
 
  for the target image. Then for each gray level 
 
 
 
 , we find the gray level 
 
 
 
  for which 
 
 
 
 
 , and this is the result of histogram matching function
 
 
 
 . Finally, we apply the function 
 
 
 
  on each pixel of the reference image.
Multiple Histograms Matching
The Histogram matching Algorithm can be extended to find a monotonic mapping between two sets of histograms. Given two sets of histograms 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the optimal monotonic color mapping 
 
 
 
 
  is calculated to minimize the distance between the two sets simultaneously, namely 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a distance metric between two histograms. The optimal solution is calculated using dynamic programming 1
