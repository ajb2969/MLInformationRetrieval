Normal-exponential-gamma distribution

In probability theory and statistics, the normal-exponential-gamma distribution (sometimes called the NEG distribution) is a three-parameter family of continuous probability distributions. It has a location parameter

 
 , scale parameter

 
  and a shape parameter

 
  .
Probability density function
The probability density function (pdf) of the normal-exponential-gamma distribution is proportional to


 
 ,
where D is a parabolic cylinder function.1
As for the Laplace distribution, the pdf of the NEG distribution can be expressed as a mixture of normal distributions,



where, in this notation, the distribution-names should be interpreted as meaning the density functions of those distributions.
Applications
The distribution has heavy tails and a sharp peak2 at 
 
 
 
  and, because of this, it has applications in variable selection.
