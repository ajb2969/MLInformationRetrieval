   Regular map (graph theory)      Regular map (graph theory)   In mathematics , a regular map is a symmetric tessellation of a closed surface . More precisely, a regular map is a decomposition of a two-dimensional manifold such as a sphere , torus , or real projective plane into topological disks, such that every flag (an incident vertex-edge-face triple) can be transformed into any other flag by a symmetry of the decomposition. Regular maps are, in a sense, topological generalizations of Platonic solids . The theory of maps and their classification is related to the theory of Riemann surfaces , hyperbolic geometry , and Galois theory . Regular maps are classified according to either: the genus and orientability of the supporting surface, the underlying graph , or the automorphism group .  Overview  Regular maps are typically defined and studied in three ways: topologically, group-theoretically, and graph-theoretically.  Topological approach  Topologically, a map is a 2-cell decomposition of a closed compact 2-manifold.  The genus g, of a map M is given by Euler's relation      χ   (  M  )    =     |  V  |   -   |  E  |    +   |  F  |          χ  M         V     E      F      \chi(M)=|V|-|E|+|F|   which is equal to    2  -   2  g       2    2  g     2-2g   if the map is orientable, and    2  -  g      2  g    2-g   if the map is non-orientable. It is a crucial fact that there is a finite (non-zero) number of regular maps for every orientable genus except the torus.  Group-theoretical approach  Group-theoretically, the permutation representation of a regular map M is a transitive permutation group  C , on a set   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   of flags , generated by three fixed-point free involutions r 0 , r 1 , r 2 satisfying (r 0 r 2 ) 2 = I. In this definition the faces are the orbits of F = 0, r'' 1 >, edges are the orbits of E = 0, r 2 >, and vertices are the orbits of V = 1, r 2 >. More abstractly, the automorphism group of any regular map is the non-degenerate, homomorphic image of a - triangle group .  Graph-theoretical approach  Graph-theoretically, a map is a cubic graph   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   with edges coloured blue, yellow, red such that   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is connected, every vertex is incident to one edge of each colour, and cycles of edges not coloured blue, have length 4. Note that   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is the flag graph or graph encoded map (GEM) of the map, defined on the vertex set of flags   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   and is not the skeleton G = (V,E) of the map. In general, |   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   | = 4|E|.  A map M is regular iff Aut(M) acts  regularly on the flags. Aut( M ) of a regular map is transitive on the vertices, edges, and faces of M . A map M is said to be reflexible iff Aut( M ) is regular and contains an automorphism   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   that fixes both a vertex v and a face f , but reverses the order of the edges. A map which is regular but not reflexible is said to be chiral .  Examples   The great dodecahedron is a regular map with pentagonal faces in the orientable surface of genus 4.  The hemicube is a regular map of type {4,3} in the projective plane .  The hemi-dodecahedron is a regular map produced by pentagonal embedding of the Petersen graph in the projective plane.  The p- hosohedron is a regular map of type {2,p}. Note that the hosohedra are non-polyhedral in the sense that they are not abstract polytopes . In particular, they do not satisfy the diamond property.  The Dyck map is a regular map of 12 octagons on a genus-3 surface. Its underlying graph, the Dyck graph , can also form a regular map of 16 hexagons in a torus.   The following is a complete list of regular maps in surfaces of positive Euler characteristic , χ: the sphere and the projective plane. 1 .      χ   g   Schläfli   Vert.
