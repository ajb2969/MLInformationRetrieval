   Pyrogallol hydroxytransferase      Pyrogallol hydroxytransferase   In enzymology , a pyrogallol hydroxytransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene + 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene and 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene (pyrogallol), whereas its two products are 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol) and 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene:1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene hydroxytransferase . Other names in common use include 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene hydroxyltransferase , 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene:pyrogallol transhydroxylase , 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene-pyrogallol hydroxyltransferase (transhydroxylase) , pyrogallol hydroxyltransferase , 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene:1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene hydroxyltransferase . This enzyme participates in benzoic acid degradation via CoA ligation.  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
