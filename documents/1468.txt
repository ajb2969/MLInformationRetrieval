   Montel space      Montel space   In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics , a Montel space , named after Paul Montel , is any topological vector space in which an analog of Montel's theorem holds. Specifically, a Montel space is a barrelled topological vector space where every closed and bounded set is compact . That is, it satisfies the Heine–Borel property .  In classical complex analysis , Montel's theorem asserts that the space of holomorphic functions on an open  connected subset of the complex numbers has this property.  Many Montel spaces of contemporary interest arise as spaces of test functions for a space of distributions . The space C ∞ (Ω) of smooth functions on an open set Ω in R n is a Montel space equipped with the topology induced by the family of seminorms        ∥  f  ∥    K  ,  n    =    sup    |  α  |   ≤  n      sup   x  ∈  K     |     ∂  α   f    (  x  )    |          subscript   norm  f    K  n      subscript  supremum      α   n      subscript  supremum    x  K          superscript   α   f   x        \|f\|_{K,n}=\sup_{|\alpha|\leq n}\sup_{x\in K}\left|\partial^{\alpha}f(x)\right|   for n = 1,2,… and K ranges over compact subsets of Ω, and α is a multi-index . Similarly, the space of compactly supported functions in an open set with the final topology of the family of inclusions      C  0  ∞    (  K  )    ⊂    C  0  ∞    (  Ω  )           subscript   superscript  C    0   K      subscript   superscript  C    0   normal-Ω     \scriptstyle{C^{\infty}_{0}(K)\subset C^{\infty}_{0}(\Omega)}   as K ranges over all compact subsets of Ω. The Schwartz space is also a Montel space.  No infinite-dimensional Banach space is a Montel space, since these cannot satisfy the Heine–Borel property: the closed unit ball is closed and bounded, but not compact.  They have the following properties:   The strong dual of a Montel space is Montel.  Montel spaces are reflexive.  A nuclear quasi-complete barrelled space is Montel.  Fréchet Montel spaces are separable and have a bornological strong dual.   Notes  References       .   "  Category:Topological vector spaces
