   Supersolvable group      Supersolvable group   In mathematics , a group is supersolvable (or supersoluble ) if it has an invariant normal series where all the factors are cyclic groups . Supersolvability is stronger than the notion of solvability .  Definition  Let G be a group . G is supersolvable if there exists a normal series       {  1  }   =    H  0   ◁   H  1   ◁  ⋯  ◁   H   s  -  1    ◁   H  s    =  G         1    normal-◁   subscript  H  0    subscript  H  1   normal-⋯   subscript  H    s  1     subscript  H  s         G     \{1\}=H_{0}\triangleleft H_{1}\triangleleft\cdots\triangleleft H_{s-1}%
 \triangleleft H_{s}=G     such that each quotient group      H   i  +  1    /    H  i         subscript  H    i  1     subscript  H  i     H_{i+1}/H_{i}\;   is cyclic and each    H  i     subscript  H  i    H_{i}   is normal in   G   G   G   .  By contrast, for a solvable group the definition requires each quotient to be abelian . In another direction, a polycyclic group must have a normal series with each quotient cyclic, but there is no requirement that each    H  i     subscript  H  i    H_{i}   be normal in   G   G   G   . As every finite solvable group is polycyclic, this can be seen as one of the key differences between the definitions. For a concrete example, the alternating group on four points,    A  4     subscript  A  4    A_{4}   , is solvable but not supersolvable.  Basic Properties  Some facts about supersolvable groups:   Supersolvable groups are always polycyclic , and hence solvable .  Every finitely generated  nilpotent group is supersolvable.  Every metacyclic group is supersolvable.  The commutator subgroup of a supersolvable group is nilpotent.  Subgroups and quotient groups of supersolvable groups are supersolvable.  A finite supersolvable group has an invariant normal series with each factor cyclic of prime order.  In fact, the primes can be chosen in a nice order: For every prime p, and for π the set of primes greater than p, a finite supersolvable group has a unique Hall π -subgroup . Such groups are sometimes called ordered Sylow tower groups.  Every group of square-free order, and every group with cyclic Sylow subgroups (a Z-group ), is supersolvable.  Every irreducible complex representation of a finite supersolvable group is monomial, that is, induced from a linear character of a subgroup. In other words, every finite supersolvable group is a monomial group .  Every maximal subgroup in a supersolvable group has prime index .  A finite group is supersolvable if and only if every maximal subgroup has prime index.  A finite group is supersolvable if and only if every maximal chain of subgroups has the same length. This is important to those interested in the lattice of subgroups of a group, and is sometimes called the Jordan–Dedekind chain condition .  By Baum's theorem , every supersolvable finite group has a DFT algorithm running in time O ( n log n ).   References   Schenkman, Eugene. Group Theory . Krieger, 1975.  Schmidt, Roland.
