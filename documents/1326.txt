   Cooling capacity      Cooling capacity   Cooling capacity is the measure of a cooling system's ability to remove heat . 1 The SI units are watts (W). Other common units include tons , and tonnes , which describe the amount of water at a given temperature that can be frozen in a given amount of time. 2 1 ton of refrigeration is the ability of a refrigerator to freeze 2000 lbm of water at 0 °C or 32 °F in the period of 24 hours. 1 ton of refrigeration is equivalent to 211 [kJ/min] or 200 [Btu/min]. 3  The basic SI units equation for deriving cooling capacity is of the form:       Q  ˙   =    m  ˙    C  p   Δ  T        normal-˙  Q      normal-˙  m    subscript  C  p   normal-Δ  T     \dot{Q}=\dot{m}C_{p}\Delta T   Where      Q  ˙     normal-˙  Q    \dot{Q}   is the cooling capacity [kW]      m  ˙     normal-˙  m    \dot{m}   is the mass rate [kg/s]      C  p     subscript  C  p    C_{p}   is the specific heat capacity [kJ/kg K]      Δ  T      normal-Δ  T    \Delta T   is the temperature change [K]  References  "  Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning     ↩  ↩  ↩
