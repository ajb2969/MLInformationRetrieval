   Quercetin-3-sulfate 4'-sulfotransferase      Quercetin-3-sulfate 4'-sulfotransferase   In enzymology , a quercetin-3-sulfate 4'-sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + quercetin 3-sulfate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + quercetin 3,4'-bissulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and quercetin 3-sulfate , whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and quercetin 3,4'-bissulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:quercetin-3-sulfate 4'-sulfotransferase . Other names in common use include flavonol 4'-sulfotransferase , and PAPS:flavonol 3-sulfate 4'-sulfotransferase .
