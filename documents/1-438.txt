   Group homomorphism      Group homomorphism     In mathematics , given two groups , ( G , ∗) and ( H , ·), a group homomorphism from ( G , ∗) to ( H , ·) is a function  h : G → H such that for all u and v in G it holds that       h   (   u  *  v   )    =     h   (  u  )    ⋅  h    (  v  )          h    u  v       normal-⋅    h  u   h   v     h(u*v)=h(u)\cdot h(v)     where the group operation on the left hand side of the equation is that of G and on the right hand side that of H .  From this property, one can deduce that h maps the identity element  e G of G to the identity element e H of H , and it also maps inverses to inverses in the sense that        h   (   u   -  1    )    =   h    (  u  )    -  1      .        h   superscript  u    1       h   superscript  u    1       h\left(u^{-1}\right)=h(u)^{-1}.\,     Hence one can say that h "is compatible with the group structure".  Older notations for the homomorphism h ( x ) may be x h , though this may be confused as an index or a general subscript. A more recent trend is to write group homomorphisms on the right of their arguments, omitting brackets, so that h ( x ) becomes simply x h . This approach is especially prevalent in areas of group theory where automata play a role, since it accords better with the convention that automata read words from left to right.  In areas of mathematics where one considers groups endowed with additional structure, a homomorphism sometimes means a map which respects not only the group structure (as above) but also the extra structure. For example, a homomorphism of topological groups is often required to be continuous.  Intuition  The purpose of defining a group homomorphism is to create functions that preserve the algebraic structure. An equivalent definition of group homomorphism is: The function h : G → H is a group homomorphism if whenever a ∗ b = c we have h ( a ) ⋅ h ( b ) = h ( c ). In other words, the group H in some sense has a similar algebraic structure as G and the homomorphism h preserves that.  Types of group homomorphism   Monomorphism: A group homomorphism that is injective (or, one-to-one); i.e., preserves distinctness. Epimorphism: A group homomorphism that is surjective (or, onto); i.e., reaches every point in the codomain.  Isomorphism : A group homomorphism that is bijective ; i.e, injective and surjective. Its inverse is also a group homomorphism. In this case, the groups G and H are called isomorphic ; they differ only in the notation of their elements and are identical for all practical purposes.  Endomorphism : A homomorphism, h : G → G ; the domain and codomain are the same. Also called an ''endomorphism of ''G.  Automorphism : An endomorphism that is bijective, and hence an isomorphism. The set of all automorphisms of a group G , with functional composition as operation, forms itself a group, the automorphism group of G . It is denoted by Aut( G ). As an example, the automorphism group of ( Z , +) contains only two elements, the identity transformation and multiplication with −1; it is isomorphic to Z /2 Z .   Image and kernel  We define the kernel of h to be the set of elements in G which are mapped to the identity in H        ker   (  h  )    ≡   {   u  ∈  G   :    h   (  u  )    =   e  H    }    .       ker  h    conditional-set    u  G       h  u    subscript  e  H       \operatorname{ker}(h)\equiv\left\{u\in G\colon h(u)=e_{H}\right\}.     and the image of h to be        im   (  h  )    ≡   h   (  G  )    ≡   {   h   (  u  )    :   u  ∈  G   }    .         im  h     h  G         conditional-set    h  u     u  G       \operatorname{im}(h)\equiv h(G)\equiv\left\{h(u)\colon u\in G\right\}.     The kernel and image of a homomorphism can be interpreted as measuring how close it is to being an isomorphism. The First Isomorphism Theorem states that the image of a group homomorphism, h ( G ) is isomorphic to the quotient group G /ker h .  The kernel of h is a normal subgroup of G and the image of h is a subgroup of H :      h   (    g   -  1    ∘  u  ∘  g   )       h     superscript  g    1    u  g     \displaystyle h\left(g^{-1}\circ u\circ g\right)     If and only if }, the homomorphism, h , is a group monomorphism ; i.e., h is injective (one-to-one). Injection directly gives that there is a unique element in the kernel, and a unique element in the kernel gives injection:      h   (   g  1   )       h   subscript  g  1     \displaystyle h(g_{1})     Examples   Consider the cyclic group  Z /3 Z = {0, 1, 2} and the group of integers Z with addition. The map h : Z → Z /3 Z with h ( u ) = u  mod 3 is a group homomorphism. It is surjective and its kernel consists of all integers which are divisible by 3.    The exponential map yields a group homomorphism from the group of real numbers  R with addition to the group of non-zero real numbers R * with multiplication. The kernel is {0} and the image consists of the positive real numbers.  The exponential map also yields a group homomorphism from the group of complex numbers  C with addition to the group of non-zero complex numbers C * with multiplication. This map is surjective and has the kernel {2π ki : k ∈ Z }, as can be seen from Euler's formula . Fields like R and C that have homomorphisms from their additive group to their multiplicative group are thus called exponential fields .   The category of groups  If  and  are group homomorphisms, then so is . This shows that the class of all groups, together with group homomorphisms as morphisms, forms a category .  Homomorphisms of abelian groups  If G and H are abelian (i.e., commutative) groups, then the set  of all group homomorphisms from G to H is itself an abelian group: the sum  of two homomorphisms is defined by   ( h + k )( u ) = h ( u ) + k ( u )    for all u in G .   The commutativity of H is needed to prove that  is again a group homomorphism.  The addition of homomorphisms is compatible with the composition of homomorphisms in the following sense: if f is in , h , k are elements of , and g is in , then    and    .    Since the composition is associative , this shows that the set End( G ) of all endomorphisms of an abelian group forms a ring , the endomorphism ring of G . For example, the endomorphism ring of the abelian group consisting of the direct sum of m copies of Z / n Z is isomorphic to the ring of m -by- m  matrices with entries in Z / n Z . The above compatibility also shows that the category of all abelian groups with group homomorphisms forms a preadditive category ; the existence of direct sums and well-behaved kernels makes this category the prototypical example of an abelian category .
