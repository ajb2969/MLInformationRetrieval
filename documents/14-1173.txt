It is constructed by a rectification of the regular 24-cell honeycomb , containing tesseract and rectified 24-cell cells.  Alternate names   Rectified icositetrachoric tetracomb  Rectified icositetrachoric honeycomb  Cantellated 16-cell honeycomb  Bicantellated tesseractic honeycomb   Symmetry constructions  There are five different symmetry constructions of this tessellation. Each symmetry can be represented by different arrangements of colored rectified 24-cell and tesseract facets. The tetrahedral prism  vertex figure contains 4 rectified 24-cells capped by two opposite tesseracts.
