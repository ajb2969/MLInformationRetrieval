   Ancestral relation      Ancestral relation   In mathematical logic , the ancestral relation (often shortened to ancestral ) of a binary relation  R is its transitive closure , however defined in a different way, see below.  Ancestral relations make their first appearance in Frege 's Begriffsschrift . Frege later employed them in his Grundgesetze as part of his definition of the finite  cardinals . Hence the ancestral was a key part of his search for a logicist foundation of arithmetic.  Definition  The numbered propositions below are taken from his Begriffsschrift and recast in contemporary notation.  A property  P is called R - hereditary if, whenever x is P and xRy holds, then y is also P :       (    P  x   ∧   x  R  y    )   →   P  y      normal-→      P  x     x  R  y      P  y     (Px\land xRy)\rightarrow Py     Frege defined b to be an R - ancestor of a , written aR * b , if b has every R -hereditary property that all objects x such that aRx have:      𝟕𝟔  :  ⊢  a   R  *   b  ↔  ∀  F   [  ∀  x   (  a  R  x  →  F  x  )   ∧  ∀  x  ∀  y   (  F  x  ∧  x  R  y  →  F  y  )   →  F  b  ]      fragments  76  normal-:  proves  a   superscript  R    b  normal-↔  for-all  F   fragments  normal-[  for-all  x   fragments  normal-(  a  R  x  normal-→  F  x  normal-)    for-all  x  for-all  y   fragments  normal-(  F  x   x  R  y  normal-→  F  y  normal-)   normal-→  F  b  normal-]     \mathbf{76:}\ \vdash aR^{*}b\leftrightarrow\forall F[\forall x(aRx\to Fx)\land%
 \forall x\forall y(Fx\land xRy\to Fy)\to Fb]     The ancestral is a transitive relation :      𝟗𝟖  :  ⊢   (  a   R  *   b  ∧  b   R  *   c  )   →  a   R  *   c     fragments  98  normal-:  proves   fragments  normal-(  a   superscript  R    b   b   superscript  R    c  normal-)   normal-→  a   superscript  R    c    \mathbf{98:}\ \vdash(aR^{*}b\land bR^{*}c)\rightarrow aR^{*}c     Let the notation I ( R ) denote that R is functional (Frege calls such relations "many-one"):      𝟏𝟏𝟓  :  ⊢  I   (  R  )   ↔  ∀  x  ∀  y  ∀  z   [   (  x  R  y  ∧  x  R  z  )   →  y  =  z  ]      fragments  115  normal-:  proves  I   fragments  normal-(  R  normal-)   normal-↔  for-all  x  for-all  y  for-all  z   fragments  normal-[   fragments  normal-(  x  R  y   x  R  z  normal-)   normal-→  y   z  normal-]     \mathbf{115:}\ \vdash I(R)\leftrightarrow\forall x\forall y\forall z[(xRy\land

 =c\lor cR^{*}b)     Relationship to transitive closure  The Ancestral relation    R  *     superscript  R     R^{*}   is equal to the transitive closure     R  +     superscript  R     R^{+}   of   R   R   R   . Indeed,    R  *     superscript  R     R^{*}   is transitive (see 98 above),    R  *     superscript  R     R^{*}   contains   R   R   R   (indeed, if aRb then, of course, b has every R -hereditary property that all objects x such that aRx have, because b is one of them), and finally,    R  *     superscript  R     R^{*}   is contained in    R  +     superscript  R     R^{+}   (indeed, assume    a   R  *   b      a   superscript  R    b    aR^{*}b   ; take the property    F  x      F  x    Fx   to be    a   R  +   x      a   superscript  R    x    aR^{+}x   ; then the two premises,    ∀  x   (  a  R  x  →  F  x  )      fragments  for-all  x   fragments  normal-(  a  R  x  normal-→  F  x  normal-)     \forall x(aRx\to Fx)   and    ∀  x  ∀  y   (  F  x  ∧  x  R  y  →  F  y  )      fragments  for-all  x  for-all  y   fragments  normal-(  F  x   x  R  y  normal-→  F  y  normal-)     \forall x\forall y(Fx\land xRy\to Fy)   , are obviously satisfied; therefore,    F  b      F  b    Fb   , which means    a   R  +   b      a   superscript  R    b    aR^{+}b   , by our choice of   F   F   F   ). See also Boolos's book below, page 8.  Discussion  Principia Mathematica made repeated use of the ancestral, as does Quine's (1951) Mathematical Logic .  However, it is worth noting that the ancestral relation cannot be defined in first-order logic . It is controversial whether second-order logic is really "logic" at all. Quine famously claimed that it was not, despite his reliance upon it for his 1951 book (which largely retells Principia in abbreviated form, for which second-order logic is required to fit its theorems).
