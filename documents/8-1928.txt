Hilbert basis (linear programming)

In linear programming, a Hilbert basis for a convex cone C is an integer cone basis: minimal set of integer vectors such that every integer vector in C is a conical combination of the vectors in the Hilbert basis with integer coefficients.
Definition
A set 
 
 
 
  of integer vectors is a Hilbert basis of its convex cone



if every integer vector from C belongs to the integer convex cone of A:



and no vector from A belongs to the integer convex cone of the others.
