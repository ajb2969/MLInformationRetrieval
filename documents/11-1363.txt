   Double-negation translation      Double-negation translation   In proof theory , a discipline within mathematical logic , double-negation translation , sometimes called negative translation , is a general approach for embedding classical logic into intuitionistic logic , typically by translating formulas to formulas which are classically equivalent but intuitionistically inequivalent. Particular instances of double-negation translation include Glivenko's translation for propositional logic , and the Gödel–Gentzen translation and Kuroda's translation for first-order logic .  Propositional logic  The easiest double-negation translation to describe comes from Glivenko's theorem , proved by Valery Glivenko in 1929. It maps each classical formula φ to its double negation ¬¬φ.  Glivenko's theorem states:   If φ is a propositional formula, then φ is a classical tautology if and only if ¬¬φ is an intuitionistic tautology.   Glivenko's theorem implies the more general statement:   If T is a set of propositional formulas, T* a set consisting of the double negated formulas of T , and φ a propositional formula, then T ⊢ φ in classical logic if and only if T* ⊢ ¬¬φ in intuitionistic logic.   In particular, a set of propositional formulas is intuitionistically consistent if and only if it is classically satisfiable.  First-order logic  The Gödel–Gentzen translation (named after Kurt Gödel and Gerhard Gentzen ) associates with each formula φ in a first-order language another formula φ N , which is defined inductively:   If   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is atomic, then    ϕ  N     superscript  ϕ  N    \phi^{N}   is    ¬  ¬  ϕ        ϕ    \neg\neg\phi            (   ϕ  ∧  θ   )   N   is   ϕ  N    ∧   θ  N          superscript    ϕ  θ   N   is   superscript  ϕ  N     superscript  θ  N     (\phi\wedge\theta)^{N}\mbox{ is }\phi^{N}\wedge\theta^{N}           (   ϕ  ∨  θ   )   N   is   ¬   (    ¬   ϕ  N    ∧   ¬   θ  N     )         superscript    ϕ  θ   N   is          superscript  ϕ  N        superscript  θ  N        (\phi\vee\theta)^{N}\mbox{ is }\neg(\neg\phi^{N}\wedge\neg\theta^{N})           (  ϕ  →  θ  )   N   is   ϕ  N   →   θ  N      fragments   superscript   fragments  normal-(  ϕ  normal-→  θ  normal-)   N   is   superscript  ϕ  N   normal-→   superscript  θ  N     (\phi\rightarrow\theta)^{N}\mbox{ is }\phi^{N}\rightarrow\theta^{N}           (   ¬  ϕ   )   N   is  ¬   ϕ  N        superscript     ϕ   N   is    superscript  ϕ  N     (\neg\phi)^{N}\mbox{ is }\neg\phi^{N}           (   ∀    x   ϕ    )   N   is   ∀    x    ϕ  N          superscript   for-all     x   ϕ    N   is   for-all     x    superscript  ϕ  N       (\forall\mbox{ }x\mbox{ }\phi)^{N}\mbox{ is }\forall\mbox{ }x\mbox{ }\phi^{N}           (   ∃    x   ϕ    )   N   is  ¬   ∀    x   ¬   ϕ  N          superscript       x   ϕ    N   is    for-all     x     superscript  ϕ  N       (\exists\mbox{ }x\mbox{ }\phi)^{N}\mbox{ is }\neg\forall\mbox{ }x\mbox{ }\neg%
 \phi^{N}      Notice that φ N is classically equivalent to φ.  The fundamental soundness theorem states: 1   If T is a set of axioms and φ a formula, then T proves φ using classical logic if and only if T N proves φ N using intuitionistic logic.   Here T N consists of the double-negation translations of the formulas in T .  Note that φ need not imply its negative translation φ N in intuitionistic first-order logic. Troelsta and Van Dalen 2 give a description (due to Leivant) of formulas which do imply their Gödel–Gentzen translation.  Variants  There are several alternative definitions of the negative translation. They are all provably equivalent in intuitionistic logic, but may be easier to apply in particular contexts.  One possibility is to change the clauses for disjunction and existential quantifier to   (φ ∨ θ) N is ¬¬(φ N ∨ θ N )  (∃ x φ) N is ¬¬∃ x φ N   Then the translation can be succinctly described as: prefix ¬¬ to every atomic formula, disjunction, and existential quantifier.  Another possibility (known as Kuroda 's translation) is to construct φ N from φ by putting ¬¬ before the whole formula and after every universal quantifier. Notice that this reduces to the simple ¬¬φ translation if φ is propositional.  It is also possible to define φ N by prefixing ¬¬ before every subformula of φ, as done by Kolmogorov . Such a translation is the logical counterpart to the call-by-name  continuation-passing style translation of functional programming languages along the lines of the Curry–Howard correspondence between proofs and programs.  Results  The double-negation translation was used by Gödel (1933) to study the relationship between classical and intuitionistic theories of the natural numbers ("arithmetic"). He obtains the following result:   If a formula φ is provable from the axioms of Peano arithmetic then φ N is provable from the axioms of intuitionistic Heyting arithmetic .   This result shows that if Heyting arithmetic is consistent then so is Peano arithmetic. This is because a contradictory formula  is interpreted as , which is still contradictory. Moreover, the proof of the relationship is entirely constructive, giving a way to transform a proof of  in Peano arithmetic into a proof of in Heyting arithmetic. (By combining the double-negation translation with the Friedman translation , it is in fact possible to prove that Peano arithmetic is Π 0 2 - conservative over Heyting arithmetic.)  The propositional mapping of φ to ¬¬φ does not extend to a sound translation of first-order logic, because  is not a theorem of intuitionistic predicate logic. This explains why φ N has to be defined in a more complicated way in the first-order case.  See also   Dialectica interpretation   Notes  References   J. Avigad and S.
