   Essentially surjective functor      Essentially surjective functor   In category theory , a functor      F  :   C  →  D      normal-:  F   normal-→  C  D     F:C\to D     is essentially surjective (or dense ) if each object   d   d   d   of   D   D   D   is isomorphic to an object of the form    F  c      F  c    Fc   for some object   c   c   c   of   C   C   C   . Any functor which is part of an equivalence is essentially surjective.  "  Category:Functors
