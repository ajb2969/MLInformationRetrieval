   Enoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase (NADPH, A-specific)      Enoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase (NADPH, A-specific)   In enzymology , an enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (NADPH, A-specific) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   trans-2,3-dehydroacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein ] and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are trans-2,3-dehydroacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein ], NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , to be specific, those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]:NADP+ oxidoreductase (A-specific) . Other names in common use include acyl-ACP dehydrogenase , enoyl-[acyl carrier protein] (reduced nicotinamide adenine , dinucleotide phosphate) reductase , NADPH 2-enoyl Co A reductase , enoyl-ACp reductase , and enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (NADPH2, A-specific) .
