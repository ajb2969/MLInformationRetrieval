Mean value theorem (divided differences)

In mathematical analysis, the mean value theorem for divided differences generalizes the mean value theorem to higher derivatives.1
Statement of the theorem
For any n + 1 pairwise distinct points x0, ..., xn in the domain of an n-times differentiable function f there exists an interior point



where the nth derivative of f equals n ! times the nth divided difference at these points:



For n = 1, that is two function points, one obtains the simple mean value theorem.
Proof
Let 
 
 
 
  be the Lagrange interpolation polynomial for f at x0, ..., xn. Then it follows from the Newton form of 
 
 
 
  that the highest term of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be the remainder of the interpolation, defined by 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  has 
 
 
 
  zeros: x0, ..., xn. By applying Rolle's theorem first to 
 
 
 
 , then to 
 
 
 
 , and so on until 
 
 
 
 , we find that 
 
 
 
  has a zero 
 
 
 
 . This means that


 
 ,



Applications
The theorem can be used to generalise the Stolarsky mean to more than two variables.
