   Serine-ethanolaminephosphate phosphodiesterase      Serine-ethanolaminephosphate phosphodiesterase   In enzymology , a serine-ethanolaminephosphate phosphodiesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   serine phosphoethanolamine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   serine + ethanolamine phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are serine phosphoethanolamine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are serine and ethanolamine phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is serine-phosphoethanolamine ethanolaminephosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include serine ethanolamine phosphodiester phosphodiesterase , and SEP diesterase . This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism .
