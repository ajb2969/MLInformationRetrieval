McKay's approximation for the coefficient of variation
In [[statistics]], '''McKay's approximation''' of the [[coefficient of variation]] is a statistic based on a sample from a [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] population.  It was introduced in 1932 by A. T. McKay.{{cite journal | last1 = McKay | first1 = A.

Let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be 
 
 
 
 
  independent observations from a 
 
 
 
  normal distribution. The population coefficient of variation is 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denote the sample mean and the sample standard deviation, respectively. Then 
 
 
 
 
  is the sample coefficient of variation. McKay’s approximation is



Note that in this expression, the first factor includes the population coefficient of variation, which is usually unknown. When 
 
 
 
  is smaller than 1/3, then 
 
 
 
  is approximately chi-square distributed with 
 
 
 
  degrees of freedom. In the original article by McKay, the expression for 
 
 
 
 
  looks slightly different, since McKay defined 
 
 
 
  with denominator 
 
 
 
  instead of 
 
 
 
 . McKay's approximation, 
 
 
 
 , for the coefficient of variation is approximately chi-square distributed, but exactly noncentral beta distributed .4
