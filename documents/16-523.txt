   McKay's approximation for the coefficient of variation      McKay's approximation for the coefficient of variation  In [[statistics]], '''McKay's approximation''' of the [[coefficient of variation]] is a statistic based on a sample from a [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] population.  It was introduced in 1932 by A. T. McKay. {{cite journal | last1 = McKay | first1 = A.

The population coefficient of variation is     c  v   =   σ  /  μ        subscript  c  v     σ  μ     c_{v}=\sigma/\mu   . Let    x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \bar{x}   and    s    s   s\,   denote the sample mean and the sample standard deviation , respectively. Then      c  ^   v   =   s  /   x  ¯         subscript   normal-^  c   v     s   normal-¯  x      \hat{c}_{v}=s/\bar{x}   is the sample coefficient of variation. McKay’s approximation is      K  =    (   1  +   1   c  v  2     )      (   n  -  1   )     c  ^   v  2     1  +     (   n  -  1   )     c  ^   v  2    /  n          K      1    1   superscript   subscript  c  v   2           n  1    superscript   subscript   normal-^  c   v   2      1        n  1    superscript   subscript   normal-^  c   v   2    n        K=\left(1+\frac{1}{c_{v}^{2}}\right)\ \frac{(n-1)\ \hat{c}_{v}^{2}}{1+(n-1)\ %
 \hat{c}_{v}^{2}/n}     Note that in this expression, the first factor includes the population coefficient of variation, which is usually unknown. When    c  v     subscript  c  v    c_{v}   is smaller than 1/3, then   K   K   K   is approximately chi-square distributed with    n  -  1      n  1    n-1   degrees of freedom. In the original article by McKay, the expression for   K   K   K   looks slightly different, since McKay defined    σ  2     superscript  σ  2    \sigma^{2}   with denominator   n   n   n   instead of    n  -  1      n  1    n-1   . McKay's approximation,   K   K   K   , for the coefficient of variation is approximately chi-square distributed, but exactly noncentral beta distributed . 4  References    "  Category:Statistical deviation and dispersion     ↩  . ↩  ↩  ↩
