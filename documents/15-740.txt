   Bahcall–Wolf cusp      Bahcall–Wolf cusp   (Figure)  Growth of a Bahcall–Wolf cusp. The unit of length is the black hole influence radius . The elapsed time is roughly one relaxation time . The dashed line shows the steady-state density profile.   Bahcall–Wolf cusp refers to a particular distribution of stars around a massive black hole at the center of a galaxy or globular cluster . If the nucleus containing the black hole is sufficiently old, exchange of orbital energy between stars drives their distribution toward a characteristic form, such that the density of stars, ρ , varies with distance from the black hole, r , as        ρ   (  r  )    ∝   r   -   7  /  4      .     proportional-to    ρ  r    superscript  r      7  4       \rho(r)\propto r^{-7/4}.     So far, no clear example of a Bahcall–Wolf cusp has been found in any galaxy or star cluster. 1 This may be due in part to the difficulty of resolving such a feature.  Distribution of stars around a supermassive black hole  Supermassive black holes reside in galactic nuclei . The total mass of the stars in a nucleus is roughly equal to the mass of the supermassive black hole. In the case of the Milky Way , the mass of the supermassive black hole is about 4 million Solar masses , and the number of stars in the nucleus is about ten million. 2  The stars move around the supermassive black hole in elliptical orbits , similar to the orbits that planets follow around the Sun. The orbital energy of a star is      E  =     𝒗  2   /  2   -    G  M   /  r        E       superscript  𝒗  2   2       G  M   r      E=\boldsymbol{v}^{2}/2-GM/r   where v is the star's velocity, r is its distance from the supermassive black hole, and M is the supermassive black hole's mass. A star's energy remains nearly constant for many orbital periods. But after roughly one relaxation time , most of the stars in the nucleus will have exchanged energy with other stars, causing their orbits to change. Bahcall and Wolf 3 showed that once this has taken place, the distribution of orbital energies has the form        N   (  E  )   d  E   =    N  0     |  E  |    -   9  /  4     d  E    ,        N  E  d  E      subscript  N  0    superscript    E       9  4     d  E     N(E)\,dE=N_{0}|E|^{-9/4}dE,     which corresponds to the density ρ = ρ 0  r  −7/4 . The figure shows how the density of stars evolves toward the Bahcall–Wolf form. The fully formed cusp 4 extends outward to a distance of roughly one-fifth the supermassive black hole's influence radius . It is believed that relaxation times in the nuclei of small, dense galaxies are short enough for Bahcall–Wolf cusps to form. 5  The Galactic Center  The influence radius of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center is about 2–3 parsecs (pc), and a Bahcall–Wolf cusp if present would extend outward to a distance of about 0.5 pc from the supermassive black hole. A region of this size is easily resolved from Earth. However, no cusp is observed; instead, the density of the oldest stars is flat or even declining toward the Galactic Center. 6 7 This observation does not necessarily rule out the existence of a Bahcall–Wolf cusp in some still unobserved component. However, current observations imply a relaxation time at the Galactic Center of roughly 10 billion years, comparable with the age of the Milky Way. It is therefore likely that not enough time has elapsed for a Bahcall–Wolf cusp to form. 8 Alternatively, some process may have destroyed the bright stars near the supermassive black hole.  Multi-mass cusps  The Bahcall–Wolf solution applies to a nucleus consisting of stars of a single mass. If there is a range of masses, each component will have a different density profile. There are two limiting cases. If the more massive stars dominate the total density, their density will follow the Bahcall–Wolf form, whereas the less-massive objects will have ρ    ∝   proportional-to   \propto    r −3/2 . 9 If the less massive stars dominate the total density, their density will follow the Bahcall–Wolf form, whereas the more-massive stars will follow ρ    ∝   proportional-to   \propto    r −2 . 10  In an old stellar population, most of the mass is either in the form of main-sequence stars, with masses   ≲   less-than-or-similar-to   \lesssim   1–2 Solar masses, or in black hole remnants , with masses ~ 10–20 Solar masses. It is likely that the main-sequence stars dominate the total density; so their density should follow the Bahcall–Wolf form whereas the black holes should have the steeper, ρ ~ r −2 profile. On the other hand, it has been suggested that the distribution of stellar masses at the Galactic Center is "top-heavy", with a much larger fraction of black holes. 11 If this is the case, the observed stars would be expected to attain the shallower density profile, ρ ~ r −3/2 . However, even this shallower profile is probably inconsistent with what is observed at the Galactic Center, implying that a Bahcall–Wolf cusp never formed. The number and distribution of black hole remnants at the Galactic Center is very poorly constrained.
