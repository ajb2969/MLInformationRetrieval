   N6-methyl-lysine oxidase      N6-methyl-lysine oxidase   In enzymology , a N6-methyl-lysine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N 6 -methyl-L-lysine + H 2 O + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-lysine + formaldehyde + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are N6-methyl-L-lysine , H 2 O , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are L-lysine , formaldehyde , and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6-methyl-L-lysine:oxygen oxidoreductase (demethylating) . Other names in common use include epsilon-alkyl-L-lysine:oxygen oxidoreductase , N6-methyllysine oxidase , epsilon-N-methyllysine demethylase , epsilon-alkyllysinase , and 6-N-methyl-L-lysine:oxygen oxidoreductase (demethylating) .
