Opposite group

 In group theory, a branch of mathematics, an opposite group is a way to construct a group from another group that allows one to define right action as a special case of left action.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a group under the operation 
 
 
 
 . The opposite group of 
 
 
 
 , denoted 
 
 
 
 , has the same underlying set as 
 
 
 
 , and its group operation 
 
 
 
  is defined by 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is abelian, then it is equal to its opposite group. Also, every group 
 
 
 
  (not necessarily abelian) is naturally isomorphic to its opposite group: An isomorphism 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 . More generally, any anti-automorphism 
 
 
 
  gives rise to a corresponding isomorphism 
 
 
 
  via 
 
 
 
 , since



Group action
Let 
 
 
 
  be an object in some category, and 
 
 
 
  be a right action. Then 
 
 
 
  is a left action defined by 
 
 
 
 , or 
 
 
 
 .
