   Reflexive operator algebra      Reflexive operator algebra   In functional analysis , a reflexive operator algebra  A is an operator algebra that has enough invariant subspaces to characterize it. Formally, A is reflexive if it is equal to the algebra of bounded operators which leave invariant each subspace left invariant by every operator in A .  This should not be confused with a reflexive space .  Examples  Nest algebras are examples of reflexive operator algebras. In finite dimensions, these are simply algebras of all matrices of a given size whose nonzero entries lie in an upper-triangular pattern.  In fact if we fix any pattern of entries in an n by n matrix containing the diagonal, then the set of all n by n matrices whose nonzero entries lie in this pattern forms a reflexive algebra.  An example of an algebra which is not reflexive is the set of 2 by 2 matrices       {    (     a     b  ;       0    a     )    :    a  ,  b   ∈  ℂ   }   .     conditional-set    a  b    0  a       a  b   ℂ     \left\{\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 0&a\end{pmatrix}\ :\ a,b\in\mathbb{C}\right\}.     This algebra is smaller than the Nest algebra      {    (     a     b  ;       0    c     )    :    a  ,  b  ,  c   ∈  ℂ   }     conditional-set    a  b    0  c       a  b  c   ℂ     \left\{\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 0&c\end{pmatrix}\ :\ a,b,c\in\mathbb{C}\right\}     but has the same invariant subspaces, so it is not reflexive.  If T is a fixed n by n matrix then the set of all polynomials in T and the identity operator forms a unital operator algebra. A theorem of Deddens and Fillmore states that this algebra is reflexive if and only if the largest two blocks in the Jordan normal form of T differ in size by at most one. For example, the algebra      {    (     a    b    0      0    a    0      0    0    a     )    :    a  ,  b   ∈  ℂ   }     conditional-set    a  b  0    0  a  0    0  0  a       a  b   ℂ     \left\{\begin{pmatrix}a&b&0\\
 0&a&0\\
 0&0&a\end{pmatrix}\ :\ a,b\in\mathbb{C}\right\}     which is equal to the set of all polynomials in      T  =   (     0    1    0      0    0    0      0    0    0     )       T    0  1  0    0  0  0    0  0  0      T=\begin{pmatrix}0&1&0\\
 0&0&0\\
 0&0&0\end{pmatrix}     and the identity is reflexive.  Hyper-reflexivity  Let   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   be a weak*-closed operator algebra contained in B(H) , the set of all bounded operators on a Hilbert space  H and for T any operator in B(H) , let       β   (  T  ,  𝒜  )    =   sup   {   ∥    P  ⟂   T  P   ∥   :    P  is a projection and   P  ⟂   𝒜  P   =   (  0  )    }          β   T  𝒜     supremum   conditional-set   norm     superscript  P  perpendicular-to   T  P        P  is a projection and   superscript  P  perpendicular-to   𝒜  P   0       \beta(T,\mathcal{A})=\sup\{\|P^{\perp}TP\|\ :\ P\mbox{ is a projection and }P^%
 {\perp}\mathcal{A}P=(0)\}   .  Observe that P is a projection involved in this supremum precisely if the range of P is an invariant subspace of   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   .  The algebra   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   is reflexive if and only if for every T in B(H) :       β   (  T  ,  𝒜  )    =   0  implies that  T  is in  𝒜         β   T  𝒜      0  implies that  T  is in  𝒜     \beta(T,\mathcal{A})=0\mbox{ implies that }T\mbox{ is in }\mathcal{A}   .  We note that for any T in B(H) the following inequality is satisfied:       β   (  T  ,  𝒜  )    ≤   dist   (  T  ,  𝒜  )          β   T  𝒜      dist   T  𝒜      \beta(T,\mathcal{A})\leq\mbox{dist}(T,\mathcal{A})   .  Here    dist   (  T  ,  𝒜  )       dist   T  𝒜     \mbox{dist}(T,\mathcal{A})   is the distance of T from the algebra, namely the smallest norm of an operator T-A where A runs over the algebra. We call   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}    hyperreflexive if there is a constant K such that for every operator T in B(H) ,       dist   (  T  ,  𝒜  )    ≤   K  β   (  T  ,  𝒜  )          dist   T  𝒜      K  β   T  𝒜      \mbox{dist}(T,\mathcal{A})\leq K\beta(T,\mathcal{A})   .  The smallest such K is called the distance constant for   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   . A hyper-reflexive operator algebra is automatically reflexive.  In the case of a reflexive algebra of matrices with nonzero entries specified by a given pattern, the problem of finding the distance constant can be rephrased as a matrix-filling problem: if we fill the entries in the complement of the pattern with arbitrary entries, what choice of entries in the pattern gives the smallest operator norm?  Examples   Every finite-dimensional reflexive algebra is hyper-reflexive. However, there are examples of infinite-dimensional reflexive operator algebras which are not hyper-reflexive.    The distance constant for a one-dimensional algebra is 1.    Nest algebras are hyper-reflexive with distance constant 1.    Many von Neumann algebras are hyper-reflexive, but it is not known if they all are.    A type I von Neumann algebra is hyper-reflexive with distance constant at most 2.
