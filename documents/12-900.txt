   Partial leverage      Partial leverage   Partial leverage is used to measure the contribution of the individual independent variables to the leverage of each observation. That is, if h i is the i th row of the diagonal of the hat matrix, the partial leverage is a measure of how h i changes as a variable is added to the regression model.  The partial leverage is computed as:        (   PL  j   )   i   =     (   X   j  ∙   [  j  ]     )   i  2     ∑   k  =  1   n     (   X   j  ∙   [  j  ]     )   k  2          subscript   subscript  PL  j   i      superscript   subscript   subscript  X   normal-∙  j   delimited-[]  j     i   2     superscript   subscript     k  1    n    superscript   subscript   subscript  X   normal-∙  j   delimited-[]  j     k   2       \left(\mathrm{PL}_{j}\right)_{i}=\frac{\left(X_{j\bullet[j]}\right)_{i}^{2}}{%
 \sum_{k=1}^{n}\left(X_{j\bullet[j]}\right)_{k}^{2}}     where   j = index of independent variable  i = index of observation  X j ·[ j ] = residuals from regressing X j against the remaining independent variables   Note that the partial leverage is the leverage of the i th point in the partial regression plot for the j th variable. Data points with large partial leverage for an independent variable can exert undue influence on the selection of that variable in automatic regression model building procedures.  In statistics , high-leverage points are those that are outliers with respect to the independent variables . In other words, high-leverage points have no neighbouring points in    ℝ  p     superscript  ℝ  p    \mathbb{R}^{p}   space, where p is the number of independent variables in a regression model. This makes the fitted model likely to pass close to a high leverage observation. Hence high-leverage points have the potential to cause large changes in the parameter estimates when they are deleted. Although an influential point will typically have high leverage, a high leverage point is not necessarily an influential point. The leverage is typically defined as the diagonal of the hat matrix       H  =   X    (    X  ′   X   )    -  1     X  ′     .      H    X   superscript     superscript  X  normal-′   X     1     superscript  X  normal-′      H=X(X^{\prime}X)^{-1}X^{\prime}.\,     See also   Partial residual plot  Partial regression plot  Variance inflation factor for a multi-linear fit  Scatterplot matrix   External links   Partial Leverage Plot   References          "  Category:Regression diagnostics
