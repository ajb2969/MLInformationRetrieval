  |- !Orthogonal projections in BC10 Coxeter plane |} In ten-dimensional geometry, a rectified 10-cube is a convex uniform 10-polytope, being a rectification of the regular 10-cube.
There are 10 rectifications of the 10-cube, with the zeroth being the 10-cube itself. Vertices of the rectified 10-cube are located at the edge-centers of the 10-cube. Vertices of the birectified 10-cube are located in the square face centers of the 10-cube. Vertices of the trirectified 10-cube are located in the cubic cell centers of the 10-cube. The others are more simply constructed relative to the 10-cube dual polytpoe, the 10-orthoplex.
These polytopes are part of a family 1023 uniform 10-polytopes with BC10 symmetry.
