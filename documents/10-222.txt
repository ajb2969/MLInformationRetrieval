   Resistive ballooning mode      Resistive ballooning mode   ''' The resistive ballooning mode (RBM) is an instability occurring in magnetized plasmas , particularly in magnetic confinement devices such as tokamaks, when the pressure gradient is opposite to the effective gravity created by a magnetic field .  Linear growth rate  The linear growth rate   γ   γ   \gamma   of the RBM instability is given as       γ  2   =   -     g   e  f  f    →   ⋅    ∇  p   p          superscript  γ  2      normal-⋅   normal-→   subscript  g    e  f  f        normal-∇  p   p       \gamma^{2}=-\vec{g_{eff}}\cdot\frac{\nabla p}{p}     where     |   ∇  p   |   ∼   p   L  p       similar-to     normal-∇  p      p   subscript  L  p      |\nabla p|\sim\frac{p}{L_{p}}   is the pressure gradient     g   e  f  f    =    c  s    |    ∇  B   B   |    ∼   1  /   R  0           subscript  g    e  f  f       subscript  c  s        normal-∇  B   B       similar-to      1   subscript  R  0       g_{eff}=c_{s}|\frac{\nabla B}{B}|\sim 1/R_{0}   is the effective gravity produced by a non-homogeneous magnetic field, R 0 is the major radius of the device, L p is a characteristic length of the pressure gradient, and c s is the plasma sound speed.  Similarity with the Rayleigh–Taylor instability  The RBM instability is similar to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability (RT), with Earth gravity    g  →     normal-→  g    \vec{g}   replaced by the effective gravity     g  →    e  f  f      subscript   normal-→  g     e  f  f     \vec{g}_{eff}   , except that for the RT instability,    g  →     normal-→  g    \vec{g}   acts on the mass density   ρ   ρ   \rho   of the fluid, whereas for the RBM instability,     g  →    e  f  f      subscript   normal-→  g     e  f  f     \vec{g}_{eff}   acts on the pressure   p   p   p   of the plasma.
