Resistive ballooning mode

''' The resistive ballooning mode (RBM) is an instability occurring in magnetized plasmas, particularly in magnetic confinement devices such as tokamaks, when the pressure gradient is opposite to the effective gravity created by a magnetic field.
Linear growth rate
The linear growth rate 
 
 
 
  of the RBM instability is given as



where 
 
 
 
  is the pressure gradient 
 
 
 
 
  is the effective gravity produced by a non-homogeneous magnetic field, R0 is the major radius of the device, Lp is a characteristic length of the pressure gradient, and cs is the plasma sound speed.
Similarity with the Rayleigh–Taylor instability
The RBM instability is similar to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability (RT), with Earth gravity 
 
 
 
  replaced by the effective gravity 
 
 
 
 , except that for the RT instability, 
 
 
 
  acts on the mass density 
 
 
 
  of the fluid, whereas for the RBM instability, 
 
 
 
 
  acts on the pressure 
 
 
 
  of the plasma.
