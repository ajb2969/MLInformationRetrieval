Lundquist number

In plasma physics, the Lundquist number (denoted by 
 
 
 
 ) is the dimensionless ratio of an Alfvén wave crossing timescale to a resistive diffusion timescale. In SI units, it is given by



where 
 
 
 
  is a typical length scale, 
 
 
 
  is the permeability of free space, 
 
 
 
  is the Alfvén speed for a plasma with magnetic field

 
 , density

 
 , ion mass

 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the plasma resistivity. High Lundquist numbers indicate highly conducting plasmas, while low Lundquist numbers indicate more resistive plasmas. Laboratory plasma experiments typically have Lundquist numbers between 
 
 
 
 , while in astrophysical situations the Lundquist number can be greater than 
 
 
 
 . Considerations of Lundquist number are especially important in magnetic reconnection.
