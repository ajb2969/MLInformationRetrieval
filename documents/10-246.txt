   Lundquist number      Lundquist number   In plasma physics , the Lundquist number (denoted by   S   S   S   ) is the dimensionless ratio of an Alfvén wave crossing timescale to a resistive diffusion timescale. In SI units , it is given by       S  =     μ  0   L   V  A    η    ,      S       subscript  μ  0   L   subscript  V  A    η     S=\frac{\mu_{0}LV_{A}}{\eta},     where   L   L   L   is a typical length scale,    μ  0     subscript  μ  0    \mu_{0}   is the permeability of free space ,     V  A   =   B     μ  0    n  0    m  i           subscript  V  A     B       subscript  μ  0    subscript  n  0    subscript  m  i        V_{A}=\frac{B}{\sqrt{\mu_{0}n_{0}m_{i}}}   is the Alfvén speed for a plasma with magnetic field    B   B   B   , density     n  0     subscript  n  0    n_{0}   , ion  mass     m  i     subscript  m  i    m_{i}   and   η   η   \eta   is the plasma resistivity . High Lundquist numbers indicate highly conducting plasmas, while low Lundquist numbers indicate more resistive plasmas. Laboratory plasma experiments typically have Lundquist numbers between     10  2   -   10  8        superscript  10  2    superscript  10  8     10^{2}-10^{8}   , while in astrophysical situations the Lundquist number can be greater than    10  20     superscript  10  20    10^{20}   . Considerations of Lundquist number are especially important in magnetic reconnection .  See also   Magnetic Reynolds number   References     "  Category:Plasma physics
