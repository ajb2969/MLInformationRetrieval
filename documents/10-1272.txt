   Benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+)      Benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+)   In enzymology , a benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   benzaldehyde + NADP + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   benzoate + NADPH + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are benzaldehyde , NADP + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are benzoate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is benzaldehyde:NADP+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include NADP+-linked benzaldehyde dehydrogenase , and benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+) . This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation and toluene and xylene degradation .
