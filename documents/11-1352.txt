   Poly(ribitol-phosphate) N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase      Poly(ribitol-phosphate) N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase   In enzymology , a poly(ribitol-phosphate) N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + poly(ribitol phosphate)   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + (N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl)poly(ribitol phosphate)   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and poly(ribitol phosphate) , whereas its two products are UDP and (N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl)poly(ribitol phosphate) .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:poly(ribitol-phosphate) N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyltransferase . Other names in common use include UDP acetylglucosamine-poly(ribitol phosphate) , acetylglucosaminyltransferase , uridine diphosphoacetylglucosamine-poly(ribitol phosphate) , and acetylglucosaminyltransferase .
