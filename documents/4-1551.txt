   Rossby parameter      Rossby parameter   The Rossby parameter (or simply beta   β   β   \beta   ) is a number used in geophysics and meteorology which arises due to the meridional variation of the Coriolis force caused by the spherical shape of the Earth. It is important in the generation of Rossby waves . The Rossby parameter   β   β   \beta   is given by 1 2      β  =    ∂  f    ∂  y    =    1  a    d   d  ϕ     (   2  ω  s  i  n  ϕ   )    =    2  ω  c  o  s  ϕ   a         β      f     y             1  a     d    d  ϕ      2  ω  s  i  n  ϕ             2  ω  c  o  s  ϕ   a      \beta=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=\frac{1}{a}\frac{d}{d\phi}(2\omega sin\phi%
 )=\frac{2\omega cos\phi}{a}     where   f   f   f   is the Coriolis parameter ,   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is the latitude,   ω   ω   \omega   is the angular speed of the Earth's rotation, and   a   a   a   is the mean radius of the Earth. Although both involve Coriolis effects, the Rossby parameter describes the variation of the effects with latitude (hence the latitudinal derivative ), and should not be confused with the Rossby number .
