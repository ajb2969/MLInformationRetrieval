   Larson-Miller Parameter      Larson-Miller Parameter   The Larson-Miller parameter is a means of predicting the lifetime of material vs. time and temperature using a correlative approach based on the Arrhenius rate equation . The value of the parameter is usually expressed as LMP = T ( C + log t ) where C is a material specific constant often approximated as 20, t is the time in hours and T is the temperature in Kelvin.  Creep -stress rupture data for high-temperature creep-resistant alloys are often plotted as log stress to rupture versus a combination of log time to rupture and temperature. One of the most common time–temperature parameters used to present this kind of data is the Larson-Miller (L.M.) parameter, which in generalized form is      P   (  L  .  M  .  )   =  T   [  log   t  r   +  C  ]      fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  L  normal-.  M  normal-.  normal-)    T   fragments  normal-[    subscript  t  r    C  normal-]     P(L.M.)=T[\log t_{r}+C]     T = temperature, K or °R     t  r     subscript  t  r    t_{r}   = stress-rupture time, h  C = constant usually of order 20  According to the L.M. parameter, at a given stress level the log time to stress rupture plus a constant of the order of 20 multiplied by the temperature in kelvins or degrees Rankine remains constant for a given material.
