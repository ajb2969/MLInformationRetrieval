Larson-Miller Parameter

The Larson-Miller parameter is a means of predicting the lifetime of material vs. time and temperature using a correlative approach based on the Arrhenius rate equation. The value of the parameter is usually expressed as LMP=T(C + log t) where C is a material specific constant often approximated as 20, t is the time in hours and T is the temperature in Kelvin.
Creep-stress rupture data for high-temperature creep-resistant alloys are often plotted as log stress to rupture versus a combination of log time to rupture and temperature. One of the most common time–temperature parameters used to present this kind of data is the Larson-Miller (L.M.) parameter, which in generalized form is



T = temperature, K or °R

 
  = stress-rupture time, h
C = constant usually of order 20
According to the L.M. parameter, at a given stress level the log time to stress rupture plus a constant of the order of 20 multiplied by the temperature in kelvins or degrees Rankine remains constant for a given material.
