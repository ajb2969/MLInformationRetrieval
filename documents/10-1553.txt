   Pyrroline-2-carboxylate reductase      Pyrroline-2-carboxylate reductase   In enzymology , a pyrroline-2-carboxylate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-proline + NAD(P)+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-proline , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are 1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-proline:NAD(P)+ 2-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called Delta1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate reductase . This enzyme participates in lysine degradation and arginine and proline metabolism .
