   Singular solution      Singular solution   A singular solution  y s ( x ) of an ordinary  differential equation is a solution that is singular or one for which the initial value problem (also called the Cauchy problem by some authors) fails to have a unique solution at some point on the solution. The set on which a solution is singular may be as small as a single point or as large as the full real line. Solutions which are singular in the sense that the initial value problem fails to have a unique solution need not be singular functions .  In some cases, the term singular solution is used to mean a solution at which there is a failure of uniqueness to the initial value problem at every point on the curve. A singular solution in this stronger sense is often given as tangent to every solution from a family of solutions. By tangent we mean that there is a point x where y s ( x ) = y c ( x ) and y' s ( x ) = y' c ( x ) where y c is a solution in a family of solutions parameterized by c . This means that the singular solution is the envelope of the family of solutions.  Usually, singular solutions appear in differential equations when there is a need to divide in a term that might be equal to zero . Therefore, when one is solving a differential equation and using division one must check what happens if the term is equal to zero, and whether it leads to a singular solution. The Picard–Lindelöf theorem , which gives sufficient conditions for unique solutions to exist, can be used to rule out the existence of singular solutions. Other theorems, such as the Peano existence theorem , give sufficient conditions for solutions to exist without necessarily being unique, which can allow for the existence of singular solutions.  A divergent solution  Consider the homogeneous linear ordinary differential         x   y  ′    (  x  )    +   2  y   (  x  )     =  0   ,          x   superscript  y  normal-′   x     2  y  x    0    xy^{\prime}(x)+2y(x)=0,\,\!     where primes denote derivatives with respect to x . The general solution to this equation is        y   (  x  )    =   C   x   -  2      .        y  x     C   superscript  x    2       y(x)=Cx^{-2}.\,\!     For a given   C   C   C   , this solution is smooth except at    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   where the solution is divergent. Furthermore, for a given    x  ≠  0      x  0    x\not=0   , this is the unique solution going through    (  x  ,   y   (  x  )    )     x    y  x     (x,y(x))   .  Failure of uniqueness  Consider the differential equation         y  ′     (  x  )   2    =   4  y   (  x  )     .         superscript  y  normal-′    superscript  x  2      4  y  x     y^{\prime}(x)^{2}=4y(x).\,\!     A one-parameter family of solutions to this equation is given by         y  c    (  x  )    =    (   x  -  c   )   2    .         subscript  y  c   x    superscript    x  c   2     y_{c}(x)=(x-c)^{2}.\,\!     Another solution is given by        y  s    (  x  )    =  0.         subscript  y  s   x   0.    y_{s}(x)=0.\,\!     Since the equation being studied is a first-order equation, the initial conditions are the initial x and y values. By considering the two sets of solutions above, one can see that the solution fails to be unique when    y  =  0      y  0    y=0   . (It can be shown that for    y  >  0      y  0    y>0   , if a single branch of the square root is chosen, then there is a local solution which is unique using the Picard–Lindelöf theorem .) Thus, the solutions above are all singular solutions, in the sense that solution fails to be unique in a neighbourhood of one or more points. (Commonly, we say "uniqueness fails" at these points.) For the first set of solutions, uniqueness fails at one point,    x  =  c      x  c    x=c   , and for the second solution, uniqueness fails at every value of   x   x   x   . Thus, the solution    y  s     subscript  y  s    y_{s}   is a singular solution in the stronger sense that uniqueness fails at every value of x . However, it is not a singular function since it and all its derivatives are continuous.  In this example, the solution      y  s    (  x  )    =  0         subscript  y  s   x   0    y_{s}(x)=0   is the envelope of the family of solutions      y  c    (  x  )    =    (   x  -  c   )   2          subscript  y  c   x    superscript    x  c   2     y_{c}(x)=(x-c)^{2}   . The solution    y  s     subscript  y  s    y_{s}   is tangent to every curve     y  c    (  x  )        subscript  y  c   x    y_{c}(x)   at the point    (  c  ,  0  )     c  0    (c,0)   .  The failure of uniqueness can be used to construct more solutions. These can be found by taking two constant     c  1   <   c  2        subscript  c  1    subscript  c  2     c_{1}   and defining a solution    y   (  x  )       y  x    y(x)   to be     (   x  -   c  1    )   2     superscript    x   subscript  c  1    2    (x-c_{1})^{2}   when    x  <   c  1       x   subscript  c  1     x   , to be   0   0    when     c  1   ≤  x  ≤   c  2          subscript  c  1   x        subscript  c  2      c_{1}\leq x\leq c_{2}   , and to be     (   x  -   c  2    )   2     superscript    x   subscript  c  2    2    (x-c_{2})^{2}   when    x  >   c  2       x   subscript  c  2     x>c_{2}   . Direct calculation shows that this is a solution of the differential equation at every point, including    x  =   c  1       x   subscript  c  1     x=c_{1}   and    x  =   c  2       x   subscript  c  2     x=c_{2}   . Uniqueness fails for these solutions on the interval     c  1   ≤  x  ≤   c  2          subscript  c  1   x        subscript  c  2      c_{1}\leq x\leq c_{2}   , and the solutions are singular, in the sense that the second derivative fails to exist, at    x  =   c  1       x   subscript  c  1     x=c_{1}   and    x  =   c  2       x   subscript  c  2     x=c_{2}   .  Further example of failure of uniqueness  The previous example might give the erroneous impression that failure of uniqueness is directly related to     y   (  x  )    =  0        y  x   0    y(x)=0   . Failure of uniqueness can also be seen in the following example of a Clairaut's equation :       y   (  x  )    =    x  ⋅   y  ′    +    (   y  ′   )   2          y  x      normal-⋅  x   superscript  y  normal-′     superscript   superscript  y  normal-′   2      y(x)=x\cdot y^{\prime}+(y^{\prime})^{2}\,\!     We write y' = p and then        y   (  x  )    =    x  ⋅  p   +    (  p  )   2     .        y  x      normal-⋅  x  p    superscript  p  2      y(x)=x\cdot p+(p)^{2}.\,\!     Now, we shall take the differential according to x :      p  =   y  ′   =   p  +   x   p  ′    +   2  p   p  ′           p   superscript  y  normal-′          p    x   superscript  p  normal-′      2  p   superscript  p  normal-′        p=y^{\prime}=p+xp^{\prime}+2pp^{\prime}\,\!     which by simple algebra yields       0  =    (    2  p   +  x   )    p  ′     .      0        2  p   x    superscript  p  normal-′      0=(2p+x)p^{\prime}.\,\!     This condition is solved if 2p+x=0 or if p'=0 .  If ''p' '' = 0 it means that y' = p = c = constant, and the general solution of this new equation is:        y  c    (  x  )    =    c  ⋅  x   +   c  2           subscript  y  c   x      normal-⋅  c  x    superscript  c  2      y_{c}(x)=c\cdot x+c^{2}\,\!     where c is determined by the initial value.  If x + 2 p = 0 than we get that p = −(1/2) x and substituting in the ODE gives         y  s    (  x  )    =    -    (   1  /  2   )    x  2     +    (   -    (   1  /  2   )   x    )   2    =   -    (   1  /  4   )   ⋅   x  2      .           subscript  y  s   x           1  2    superscript  x  2      superscript        1  2   x    2            normal-⋅    1  4    superscript  x  2        y_{s}(x)=-(1/2)x^{2}+(-(1/2)x)^{2}=-(1/4)\cdot x^{2}.\,\!     Now we shall check when these solutions are singular solutions. If two solutions intersect each other, that is, they both go through the same point (x,y) , then there is a failure of uniqueness for a first-order ordinary differential equation. Thus, there will be a failure of uniqueness if a solution of the first form intersects the second solution.  The condition of intersection is : y s ( x ) = y c ( x ). We solve        c  ⋅  x   +   c  2    =    y  c    (  x  )    =    y  s    (  x  )    =   -    (   1  /  4   )   ⋅   x  2              normal-⋅  c  x    superscript  c  2       subscript  y  c   x           subscript  y  s   x           normal-⋅    1  4    superscript  x  2        c\cdot x+c^{2}=y_{c}(x)=y_{s}(x)=-(1/4)\cdot x^{2}\,\!     to find the intersection point, which is    (   -   2  c    ,   -   c  2    )         2  c       superscript  c  2      (-2c,-c^{2})   .  We can verify that the curves are tangent at this point y' s ( x ) = y' c ( x ). We calculate the derivatives :        y  c  ′    (   -   2  ⋅  c    )    =  c         superscript   subscript  y  c   normal-′      normal-⋅  2  c     c    y_{c}^{\prime}(-2\cdot c)=c\,\!            y  s  ′    (   -   2  ⋅  c    )    =   -      (   1  /  2   )   ⋅  x   |    x  =   -   2  ⋅  c       =  c   .           superscript   subscript  y  s   normal-′      normal-⋅  2  c        evaluated-at   normal-⋅    1  2   x     x     normal-⋅  2  c            c     y_{s}^{\prime}(-2\cdot c)=-(1/2)\cdot x|_{x=-2\cdot c}=c.\,\!     Hence,        y  s    (  x  )    =   -    (   1  /  4   )   ⋅   x  2            subscript  y  s   x      normal-⋅    1  4    superscript  x  2       y_{s}(x)=-(1/4)\cdot x^{2}\,\!     is tangent to every member of the one-parameter family of solutions        y  c    (  x  )    =    c  ⋅  x   +   c  2           subscript  y  c   x      normal-⋅  c  x    superscript  c  2      y_{c}(x)=c\cdot x+c^{2}\,\!     of this Clairaut equation:        y   (  x  )    =    x  ⋅   y  ′    +    (   y  ′   )   2     .        y  x      normal-⋅  x   superscript  y  normal-′     superscript   superscript  y  normal-′   2      y(x)=x\cdot y^{\prime}+(y^{\prime})^{2}.\,\!
