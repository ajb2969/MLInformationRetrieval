   Cosheaf      Cosheaf   In topology, a branch of mathematics, a cosheaf with values in an ∞-category  C that admits colimit is a functor F from the category of open subsets of a topological space X (more precisely its nerve ) to C such that   (1) The F of the empty set is the initial object.  (2) For any increasing sequence    U  i     subscript  U  i    U_{i}   of open subsets with union U , the canonical map      lim  →    F   (   U  i   )     →   F   (  U  )       normal-→   injective-limit    F   subscript  U  i       F  U     \underrightarrow{\lim}F(U_{i})\to F(U)   is an equivalence.  (3)    F   (   U  ∪  V   )       F    U  V     F(U\cup V)   is the pushout of     F   (   U  ∩  V   )    →   F   (  U  )       normal-→    F    U  V      F  U     F(U\cap V)\to F(U)   and     F   (   U  ∩  V   )    →   F   (  V  )       normal-→    F    U  V      F  V     F(U\cap V)\to F(V)   .   The basic example is    U  ↦    C  *    (  U  ;  A  )       maps-to  U     subscript  C     U  A      U\mapsto C_{*}(U;A)   where on the right is the singular chain complex of U with coefficients in an abelian group A .  Example: 1 If f is a continuous map, then    U  ↦    f   -  1     (  U  )       maps-to  U     superscript  f    1    U     U\mapsto f^{-1}(U)   is a cosheaf.
