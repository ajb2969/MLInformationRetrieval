Cosheaf

In topology, a branch of mathematics, a cosheaf with values in an âˆž-category C that admits colimit is a functor F from the category of open subsets of a topological space X (more precisely its nerve) to C such that

(1) The F of the empty set is the initial object.
(2) For any increasing sequence 
 
 
 
  of open subsets with union U, the canonical map 
 
 
 
  is an equivalence.
(3) 
 
 
 
  is the pushout of 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .

The basic example is 
 
 
 
  where on the right is the singular chain complex of U with coefficients in an abelian group A.
Example:1 If f is a continuous map, then 
 
 
 
  is a cosheaf.
