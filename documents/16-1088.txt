   Iterated forcing      Iterated forcing   In mathematics, iterated forcing is a method for constructing models of set theory by repeating Cohen's forcing method a transfinite number of times. Iterated forcing was introduced by  in their construction of a model of set theory with no Suslin tree . They also showed that iterated forcing can construct models where Martin's axiom holds and the continuum is any given regular cardinal.  In iterated forcing, one has a transfinite sequence P α of forcing notions indexed by some ordinals α, which give a family of Boolean-valued models V P α . If α+1 is a successor ordinal then P α+1 is often constructed from P α using a forcing notion in V P α , while if α is a limit ordinal then P α is often constructed as some sort of limit (such as the direct limit) of the P β for β<α.  A key consideration is that, typically, it is necessary that    ω  1     subscript  ω  1    \omega_{1}   is not collapsed. This is often accomplished by the use of a preservation theorem such as:  + Finite support iteration of c.c.c. forcings (see countable chain condition ) are c.c.c. and thus preserve    ω  1     subscript  ω  1    \omega_{1}   .  + Countable support iterations of proper forcings are proper (see Fundamental Theorem of Proper Forcing ) and thus preserve    ω  1     subscript  ω  1    \omega_{1}   .  + Revised countable support iterations of semi-proper forcings are semi-proper and thus preserve    ω  1     subscript  ω  1    \omega_{1}   .  Some non-semi-proper forcings, such as Namba forcing, can be iterated with appropriate cardinal collapses while preserving    ω  1     subscript  ω  1    \omega_{1}   using methods developed by Saharon Shelah 1 2 3  References        External links     "  Category:Forcing (mathematics)     Shelah, S., Proper and Improper Forcing, Springer 1992 ↩  Schlindwein, Chaz, Shelah's work on non-semiproper iterations I, Archive for Mathematical Logic (47) 2008 pp. 579 -- 606 ↩  Schlindwein, Chaz, Shelah's work on non-semiproper iterations II, Journal of Symbolic Logic (66) 2001, pp. 1865 -- 1883 ↩
