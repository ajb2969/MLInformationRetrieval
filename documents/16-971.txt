James Maynard (mathematician)

James Maynard (born 10 June 1987) is a British mathematician best known for his work on prime gaps.1
In November 2013, Maynard gave a different proof of Yitang Zhang's theorem2 that there are bounded gaps between primes, and resolved a longstanding conjecture by showing that for any 
 
 
 
  there are infinitely many intervals of bounded length containing 
 
 
 
  prime numbers.3 This work can be seen as progress on the Hardy–Littlewood 
 
 
 
 -tuples conjecture as it establishes that "a positive proportion of admissible 
 
 
 
 -tuples satisfy the prime 
 
 
 
 -tuples conjecture for every 
 
 
 
 ."4 Maynard's approach yielded the upper bound



which improved significantly upon the best existing bounds due to the Polymath 8 project.5 (In other words, he showed that there are infinitely many prime gaps at most 600.) Subsequently, Polymath 8b was created,6 whose collaborative efforts have reduced the gap size to 252.7
As of April 14, 2014, one year after Zhang's announcement, according to the Polymath project wiki, N has been reduced to 246.8 Further, assuming the Elliott–Halberstam conjecture and its generalized form, the Polymath project wiki states that N has been reduced to 12 and 6, respectively.9
In August 2014, Maynard10 (and independently of Ford,  Green, Konyagin and  Tao) resolved a longstanding conjecture of Erdos on large gaps between primes, and received the largest Erdos prize (10000$) ever offered11.
After completing his bachelor's and master's degrees at Cambridge University in 2009, Maynard obtained his Ph.D. from Oxford University at Balliol College in 2013 under the supervision of Roger Heath-Brown.12 For the 2013–2014 year, Maynard was a CRM-ISM postdoctoral researcher at the University of Montreal.13
In 2014, he was awarded the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize.14
