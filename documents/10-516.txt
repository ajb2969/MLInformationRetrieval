   Alcohol dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+)      Alcohol dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+)   In enzymology , an alcohol dehydrogenase [NAD(P) + ] () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an alcohol + NAD(P) +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   an aldehyde + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are alcohol , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are aldehyde , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alcohol:NAD(P) + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include retinal reductase , aldehyde reductase (NADPH/NADH) , and alcohol dehydrogenase [NAD(P)] . This enzyme participates in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis .
