Abstract rewriting machine

The Abstract Rewriting Machine (ARM) is a virtual machine which implements term rewriting for minimal term rewriting systems.
Minimal term rewriting systems are left-linear term rewriting systems in which each rule takes on one of six forms:


Continuation
 
 

 Return
 
 

 Match
 
 

 Add:

{\rm for }~y\in\vec{x}\cup\vec{z}

Delete
 
 

 Ident
 
 



Each of these six forms is mapped (in ARM) to one or a few processor instructions on most contemporary micro processors. Accordingly, minimal term rewriting is achieved at tens to hundreds of clock cycles per reduction stepâ€”millions of reduction steps per second.
ARM implements general term rewriting, in that every single-sorted unconditional left-linear term rewriting system can be transformed (compiled) into a minimal term rewriting system that gives rise to the same normal form relation.
An overview with references to this compilation process for innermost rewriting, as well as a detailed overview of ARM, can be found in [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=291903&dl;;=GUIDE&coll;=&CFID;=15151515&CFTOKEN;=6184618 "Within ARM's reach: compilation of left-linear rewrite systems via minimal rewrite systems"]. A description for lazy (non-innermost) rewriting can be found in [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=345102&dl;;=ACM&coll;=ACM&CFID;=15151515&CFTOKEN;=6184618 "Lazy rewriting on eager machinery"].
A documented implementation of ARM (with the term rewriting language Epic) is available here. Note that site and software are no longer being actively maintained.
