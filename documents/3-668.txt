Exact differential

In multivariate calculus, a differential is said to be exact (or perfect), as contrasted with an inexact differential, if it is of the form dQ, for some differentiable function Q.
Overview
Definition
We work in three dimensions, with similar definitions holding in any other number of dimensions. In three dimensions, a form of the type



is called a differential form. This form is called exact on a domain 
 
 
 
  in space if there exists some scalar function

 
  defined on 
 
 
 
 
  such that




throughout D. This is equivalent to saying that the vector field 
 
 
 
  is a conservative vector field, with corresponding potential 
 
 
 
 .
One dimension
In one dimension, a differential form



is exact as long as 
 
 
 
  has an antiderivative; in this case let 
 
 
 
  be the antiderivative of 
 
 
 
 . Otherwise, if 
 
 
 
  does not have an antiderivative, we cannot write 
 
 
 
 
  and so the differential form is inexact.
Two and three dimensions
By symmetry of second derivatives, for any "nice" (non-pathological) function 
 
 
 
  we have



Hence, it follows that in a simply-connected region R of the xy-plane, a differential



is an exact differential if and only if the following holds:



For three dimensions, a differential



is an exact differential in a simply-connected region R of the xyz-coordinate system if between the functions A, B and C there exist the relations:


 
    ;   
 
 
 
    ;   
 
 



Note: The subscripts outside the parenthesis indicate which variables are being held constant during differentiation. Due to the definition of the partial derivative, these subscripts are not required, but they are included as a reminder.
 



These conditions are equivalent to the following one: If G is the graph of this vector valued function then for all tangent vectors X,Y of the surface G then s(X, Y) = 0 with s the symplectic form.
These conditions, which are easy to generalize, arise from the independence of the order of differentiations in the calculation of the second derivatives. So, in order for a differential dQ, that is a function of four variables to be an exact differential, there are six conditions to satisfy.
In summary, when a differential dQ is exact:

the function Q exists;


 
  independent of the path followed.

In thermodynamics, when dQ is exact, the function Q is a state function of the system. The thermodynamic functions U, S, H, A and G are state functions. Generally, neither work nor heat is a state function. An exact differential is sometimes also called a 'total differential', or a 'full differential', or, in the study of differential geometry, it is termed an exact form.
Partial differential relations
If three variables, 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are bound by the condition 
 
 
 
  for some differentiable function 
 
 
 
 , then the following total differentials exist1






Substituting the first equation into the second and rearranging, we obtain2








 
  Since 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are independent variables, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  may be chosen without restriction. For this last equation to hold in general, the bracketed terms must be equal to zero.3
Reciprocity relation
Setting the first term in brackets equal to zero yields4



A slight rearrangement gives a reciprocity relation,5



There are two more permutations of the foregoing derivation that give a total of three reciprocity relations between 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Reciprocity relations show that the inverse of a partial derivative is equal to its reciprocal.
Cyclic relation
The cyclic relation is also known as the cyclic rule or the Triple product rule. Setting the second term in brackets equal to zero yields6



Using a reciprocity relation for 
 
 
 
 
  on this equation and reordering gives a cyclic relation (the triple product rule),7



If, instead, a reciprocity relation for 
 
 
 
  is used with subsequent rearrangement, a standard form for implicit differentiation is obtained:



Some useful equations derived from exact differentials in two dimensions
(See also Bridgman's thermodynamic equations for the use of exact differentials in the theory of thermodynamic equations)
Suppose we have five state functions 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 
 . Suppose that the state space is two dimensional and any of the five quantities are exact differentials. Then by the chain rule



but also by the chain rule:



and



so that:









 \left[
 \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)_y
 \left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\right)_u
 +
 \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\right)_x
 \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial v}\right)_u
 \right]dv

which implies that:



Letting 
 
 
 
  gives:



Letting 
 
 
 
  gives:



Letting

  gives:



using (
