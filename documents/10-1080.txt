   Juglone 3-monooxygenase      Juglone 3-monooxygenase   In enzymology , juglone 3-monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone + AH 2 + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3,5-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone + A + H 2 O   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone , AH 2 , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 3,5-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone , A, and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O miscellaneous. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone,hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating) . Other names in common use include juglone hydroxylase , naphthoquinone hydroxylase , and naphthoquinone-hydroxylase .  References     "  Category:EC 1.14.99  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
