Heavy traffic approximation

In queueing theory, a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, a heavy traffic approximation (sometimes heavy traffic limit theorem1 or diffusion approximation) is the matching of a queueing model with a diffusion process under some limiting conditions on the model's parameters. The first such result was published by John Kingman who showed that when the utilisation parameter of an M/M/1 queue is near 1 a scaled version of the queue length process can be accurately approximated by a reflected Brownian motion.2
Heavy traffic condition
Heavy traffic approximations are typically stated for the process X(t) describing the number of customers in the system at time t. They are arrived at by considering the model under the limiting values of some model parameters and therefore for the result to be finite the model must be rescaled by a factor n, denoted3








and the limit of this process is considered as n → ∞.
There are three classes of regime under which such approximations are generally considered.

The number of servers is fixed and the traffic intensity (utilization) is increased to 1 (from below). The queue length approximation is a reflected Brownian motion.456
Traffic intensity is fixed and the number of servers and arrival rate are increased to infinity. Here the queue length limit converges to the normal distribution.789
A quantity β is fixed where






with ρ representing the traffic intensity and s the number of servers. Traffic intensity and the number of servers are increased to infinity and the limiting process is a hybrid of the above results. This case, first published by Halfin and Whitt is often known as the Halfin–Whitt regime101112 or quality-and-efficiency-driven (QED) regime.13




Results for a G/G/1 queue
Theorem 1. 14 Consider a sequence of G/G/1 queues indexed by 
 
 
 
 .
 For queue 
 
 

 let 
 
 
 
  denote the random inter-arrival time, 
 
 
 
  denote the random service time; let 
 
 
 
  denote the traffic intensity with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ; let 
 
 
 
  denote the waiting time in queue for a customer in steady state; Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

Suppose that 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . then


provided that:
(a) 
 
 
 
  (b) for some 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are both less than some constant 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
Heuristic argument

Waiting time in queue

Let 
 
 
 
  be the difference between the nth service time and the nth inter-arrival time; Let 
 
 
 
  be the waiting time in queue of the nth customer;
Then by definition:


 
  After recursive calculation, we have:




Random walk

Let 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
  are i.i.d; Define 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ;
Then we have








 
  we get 
 
 
 
  by taking limit over 
 
 
 
 .
Thus the waiting time in queue of the nth customer 
 
 
 
  is the supremum of a random walk with a negative drift.

Brownian motion approximation

Random walk can be approximated by a Brownian motion when the jump sizes approach 0 and the times between the jump approach 0.
  We have 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  has independent and stationary increments. When the traffic intensity 
 
 
 
  approaches 1 and k approach to 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
  after replaced k with continuous value t according to functional central limit theorem.15 Thus the waiting time in queue of the nth customer can be approximated by the supremum of a Brownian motion with a negative drift.

Supremum of Brownian motion

Theorem 2.16 Let 
 
 
 
  be a Brownian motion with drift 
 
 
 
  and standard deviation 
 
 
 
  starting at the origin, and let 
 
 

if 
 
 



 
  otherwise



Conclusion


 
  under heavy traffic condition Thus, the heavy traffic limit theorem (Theorem 1) is heuristically argued. Formal proofs usually follow a different approach which involve characteristic functions.1718
Example
Consider an M/G/1 queue with arrival rate 
 
 
 
 ,the mean of the service time 
 
 
 
 , and the variance of the service time 
 
 
 
 . What is average waiting time in queue in the steady state?
The exact average waiting time in queue in steady state is give by:


 
  The corresponding heavy traffic approximation:


 
  The relative error of the heavy traffic approximation:


 
  Thus when
