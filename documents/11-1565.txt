   Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase      Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase   In enzymology , a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate , whereas its two products are ADP and 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-phosphotransferase . This enzyme is also called type I phosphoinositide 3-kinase . This enzyme participates in 29 metabolic pathways : inositol phosphate metabolism , erbb signaling pathway , phosphatidylinositol signaling system , mtor signaling pathway , apoptosis , VEGF signaling pathway , focal adhesion , toll-like receptor signaling pathway , jak-stat signaling pathway , natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity , t cell receptor signaling pathway , b cell receptor signaling pathway , fc epsilon ri signaling pathway , leukocyte transendothelial migration , regulation of actin cytoskeleton , insulin signaling pathway , progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation , Type II diabetes mellitus , colorectal cancer , renal cell carcinoma , pancreatic cancer , endometrial cancer , glioma , prostate cancer , melanoma , chronic myeloid leukemia , acute myeloid leukemia , small cell lung cancer , and non-small cell lung cancer .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .  Examples  Human genes encoding proteins with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase activity include:   PIK3CA  PIK3CB  PIK3CD  PIK3CG   References     "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Enzymes of known structure
