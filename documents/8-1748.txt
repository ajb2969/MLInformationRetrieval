   Hamiltonian matrix      Hamiltonian matrix   In mathematics , a Hamiltonian matrix is a    2  n      2  n    2n   -by-    2  n      2  n    2n    matrix    A   A   A   such that    J  A      J  A    JA   is symmetric , where   J   J   J   is the skew-symmetric matrix      J  =   [     0     I  n        -   I  n      0     ]       J    0   subscript  I  n        subscript  I  n    0      J=\begin{bmatrix}0&I_{n}\\
 -I_{n}&0\\
 \end{bmatrix}     and is the   n   n   n   -by-   n   n   n    identity matrix . In other words,   A   A   A   is Hamiltonian if and only if where denotes the transpose . 1  Properties  Suppose that the    2  n      2  n    2n   -by-    2  n      2  n    2n   matrix   A   A   A   is written as the block matrix      A  =   [     a    b      c    d     ]       A    a  b    c  d      A=\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\
 c&d\end{bmatrix}   where   a   a   a   ,   b   b   b   ,   c   c   c   , and   d   d   d   are   n   n   n   -by-   n   n   n   matrices. Then the condition that   A   A   A   be Hamiltonian is equivalent to requiring that the matrices   b   b   b   and   c   c   c   are symmetric, and that . 2 3 Another equivalent condition is that   A   A   A   is of the form    1  =  A  =   J  S         1  A         J  S      1=A=JS   with   S   S   S   symmetric. 4  It follows easily from the definition that the transpose of a Hamiltonian matrix is Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the sum (and any linear combination ) of two Hamiltonian matrices is again Hamiltonian, as is their commutator . It follows that the space of all Hamiltonian matrices is a Lie algebra , denoted    s  p   (   2  n   )       s  p    2  n     sp(2n)   . The dimension of    s  p   (   2  n   )       s  p    2  n     sp(2n)   is . The corresponding Lie group is the symplectic group     S  p   (   2  n   )       S  p    2  n     Sp(2n)   . This group consists of the symplectic matrices , those matrices   A   A   A   which satisfy . Thus, the matrix exponential of a Hamiltonian matrix is symplectic. However the logarithm of a symplectic matrix is not necessarily Hamiltonian because the exponential map from the Lie algebra to the group is not surjective. 5 6  The characteristic polynomial of a real Hamiltonian matrix is even . Thus, if a Hamiltonian matrix has   λ   λ   λ   as an eigenvalue , then    −  λ      normal-−  λ    −λ   , and are also eigenvalues. 7 It follows that the trace of a Hamiltonian matrix is zero.  The square of a Hamiltonian matrix is skew-Hamiltonian (a matrix   A   A   A   is skew-Hamiltonian if ). Conversely, every skew-Hamiltonian matrix arises as the square of a Hamiltonian matrix. 8  Extension to complex matrices  The definition for Hamiltonian matrices can be extended to complex matrices in two ways. One possibility is to say that a matrix   A   A   A   is Hamiltonian if , as above. 9 10 Another possibility is to use the condition where denotes the conjugate transpose . 11  Hamiltonian operators  Let   V   V   V   be a vector space, equipped with a symplectic form   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   . A linear map    A  :   V  ↦  V      normal-:  A   maps-to  V  V     A:\;V\mapsto V   is called a Hamiltonian operator with respect to   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   if the form     x  ,  y   ↦   Ω   (   A   (  x  )    ,  y  )       maps-to   x  y     normal-Ω     A  x   y      x,y\mapsto\Omega(A(x),y)   is symmetric. Equivalently, it should satisfy       Ω   (   A   (  x  )    ,  y  )    =   -   Ω   (  x  ,   A   (  y  )    )           normal-Ω     A  x   y        normal-Ω   x    A  y        \Omega(A(x),y)=-\Omega(x,A(y))     Choose a basis in   V   V   V   , such that   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   is written as      ∑  i    e  i    ∧   e   n  +  i          subscript   i    subscript  e  i     subscript  e    n  i      \sum_{i}e_{i}\wedge e_{n+i}   . A linear operator is Hamiltonian with respect to   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   if and only if its matrix in this basis is Hamiltonian. 12  References    "  Category:Matrices     . ↩   . ↩    . ↩   . ↩    . ↩
