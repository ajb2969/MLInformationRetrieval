   D-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptose 1-phosphate guanylyltransferase      D-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptose 1-phosphate guanylyltransferase   D-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptose 1-phosphate guanylyltransferase (, hddC (gene) , gmhD (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name GTP:D-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptose 1-phosphate guanylyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   D-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptose 1-phosphate + GTP   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GDP-D-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptose + diphosphate    The enzyme is involved in biosynthesis of GDP-D-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptose.
