Names and etymology  The oldest known name of the town is Asepsus (Ασεψούς in Ancient greek ). This was also the name of the brook, that flows next to the city center and was crossed by the Roman  Aesepus Bridge . Research shows that the subsequent name was Artemea (Αρτεμέα), a derivation of the Greek goddess Artemis .  After the Ottoman conquest the name Gönen was used. The etymological source of that name is still disputed. Widely accepted possibilities are:   Non-Turkish possibilities:  Ka-wana : A word meaning "Sheepland/Sheep Country" in Luwian  Germenon : A word meaning " Hot Spring "  Giunan : A word meaning "Greek" (Yion in ancient Greek ), becoming "Giunen" and then "Gonen" in Turkish     Possible meanings in Turkish :  A small pond that dries in summer, small pond, placid water  Humid, wet, well-watered.    Also, some sources indicate that there was a nomadic tribe of the "Yörükan community" bearing the name "Gönen","Gönan" or "Gönenlü". The tribe was loosely based around Adana and Maraş .  History  According to Evliya Çelebi 's Seyahatname (In which he collected the notes of his journeys), Gönen was used by the governors of Bursa as a summer holiday location, where they enjoyed the therapeutic uses of the hot springs .  On 18 March 1953, Gönen suffered a devastating 7.3    M  w     subscript  M  normal-w    M_{\mathrm{w}}   earthquake which left 50 dead in Gönen and hundreds of buildings damaged. 1 a previous devastating earthquake had occurred here in 1440 AD. 2  Demographics  According to, the census that took place in 2010, the population is 43,802.
