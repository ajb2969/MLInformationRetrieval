   Sten scores      Sten scores   The results for some scales of some psychometric instruments are returned as sten scores , sten being an abbreviation for 'Standard Ten' and thus closely related to stanine scores.  Definition  A sten score indicates an individual's approximate position (as a range of values) with respect to the population of values and, therefore, to other people in that population. The individual sten scores are defined by reference to a standard normal distribution. Unlike stanine scores, which have a midpoint of five, sten scores have no midpoint (the midpoint is the value 5.5). Like stanines, individual sten scores are demarcated by half standard deviations. Thus, a sten score of 5 includes all standard scores from -.5 to zero and is centered at -0.25 and a sten score of 4 includes all standard scores from -1.0 to -0.5 and is centered at -0.75. A sten score of 1 includes all standard scores below -2.0. Sten scores of 6-10 "mirror" scores 5-1. The table below shows the standard scores that define stens and the percent of individuals drawn from a normal distribution that would receive sten score.

The resulting decimal value may be used as-is or rounded to an integer.  For example, suppose that scale scores are found to have a mean of 23.5, a standard deviation of 4.2, and to be approximately normally distributed. Then sten scores for this scale can be calculated using the formula,       (   s  -  23.5   )   4.2   2   +  5.5            s  23.5   4.2   2   5.5    \frac{(s-23.5)}{4.2}2+5.5   . It is also usually necessary to truncate such scores, particularly if the scores are skewed.  An alternative method of calculation requires that the scale developer prepare a table to convert raw scores to sten scores by apportioning percentages according to the distribution shown in the table. For example, if the scale developer observes that raw scores 0-3 comprise 2% of the population, then these raw scores will be converted to a sten score of 1 and a raw score of 4 (and possibly 5, etc.) will be converted to a sten score of 2. This procedure is a non-linear transformation that will normalize the sten scores and usually the resulting stens will only approximate the percentages shown in the table. The 16PF Questionnaire uses this scoring method. 2  References    "  Category:Psychometrics     McNab, D. et al Career Values Scale: Manual & Users' Guide, Psychometrics Publishing, 2005. ↩  Russell, M.T., & Karol, D.
