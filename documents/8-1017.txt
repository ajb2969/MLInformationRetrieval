   Support (measure theory)      Support (measure theory)   In mathematics , the support (sometimes topological support or spectrum ) of a measure  μ on a measurable  topological space ( X , Borel( X )) is a precise notion of where in the space X the measure "lives". It is defined to be the largest ( closed ) subset of X for which every open  neighbourhood of every point of the set has positive measure.  Motivation  A (non-negative) measure μ on a measurable space ( X , Σ) is really a function μ : Σ → [0, +∞]. Therefore, in terms of the usual definition of support , the support of μ is a subset of the σ-algebra Σ:       supp   (  μ  )    :=    {   A  ∈   Σ   ∣   μ   (  A  )    >   0    }   ¯      assign    supp  μ    normal-¯     A    normal-Σ   ket    μ  A    0        \mathrm{supp}(\mu):=\overline{\{A\in\Sigma\mid\mu(A)>0\}}     where the overbar denotes set closure . However, this definition is somewhat unsatisfactory: we use the notion of closure, but we do not even have a topology on Σ! What we really want to know is where in the space X the measure μ is non-zero. Consider two examples:   Lebesgue measure  λ on the real line  R . It seems clear that λ "lives on" the whole of the real line.  A Dirac measure  δ p at some point p ∈ R . Again, intuition suggests that the measure δ p "lives at" the point p , and nowhere else.   In light of these two examples, we can reject the following candidate definitions in favour of the one in the next section:   We could remove the points where μ is zero, and take the support to be the remainder X \ { x ∈ X | μ ({ x }) = 0 }. This might work for the Dirac measure δ p , but it would definitely not work for λ : since the Lebesgue measure of any point is zero, this definition would give λ empty support.  By comparison with the notion of strict positivity of measures, we could take the support to be the set of all points with a neighbourhood of positive measure:         {   x  ∈   X   ∣    for some open   N  x    ∋   x  ,   μ   (   N  x   )      >   0    }       x    X   ket     x    μ   subscript  N  x       for some open   subscript  N  x      0      \{x\in X\mid\text{for some open }N_{x}\ni x,\mu(N_{x})>0\}         (or the closure of this). It is also too simplistic: by taking N x = X for all points x ∈ X , this would make the support of every measure except the zero measure the whole of X .   However, the idea of "local strict positivity" is not too far from a workable definition:  Definition  Let ( X , T ) be a topological space ; let B( T ) denote the Borel σ-algebra on X , i.e. the smallest sigma algebra on X that contains all open sets U ∈ T . Let μ be a measure on ( X , B( T )). Then the support (or spectrum ) of μ is defined as the set of all points x in X for which every open  neighbourhood  N x of x has positive measure:        supp   (  μ  )    :=   {   x  ∈  X   ∣   x  ∈   N  x   ∈  T  ⟹   μ   (   N  x   )    >  0   }    .     assign    supp  μ    conditional-set    x  X       x   subscript  N  x        T         μ   subscript  N  x         0       \mathrm{supp}(\mu):=\{x\in X\mid x\in N_{x}\in T\implies\mu(N_{x})>0\}.     Some authors prefer to take the closure of the above set. However, this is not necessary: see "Properties" below.  An equivalent definition of support is as the largest closed set  C ⊆ X (with respect to inclusion) such that every open set which has non-trivial intersection with the support has positive measure:      U  ∈    T  and  U   ∩  C   ≠  ∅  ⟹   μ   (   U  ∩  C   )    >  0.        U      T  and  U   C                μ    U  C         0.     U\in T\text{ and }U\cap C\neq\varnothing\implies\mu(U\cap C)>0.     Properties   A measure μ on X is strictly positive if and only if it has support supp( μ ) = X . If μ is strictly positive and x ∈ X is arbitrary, then any open neighbourhood of x , since it is an open set , has positive measure; hence, x ∈ supp( μ ), so supp( μ ) = X . Conversely, if supp( μ ) = X , then every non-empty open set (being an open neighbourhood of some point in its interior, which is also a point of the support) has positive measure; hence, μ is strictly positive.  The support of a measure is closed in X as its complement is the union of the open sets of measure 0.  In general the support of a nonzero measure may be empty: see the examples below. However if X is a topological Hausdorff space and µ is a Radon measure , a measurable set  A outside the support has measure zero :         A  ⊆   X  ∖   supp   (  μ  )     ⟹   μ   (  A  )    =  0.        A    X    supp  μ           μ  A        0.     A\subseteq X\setminus\mathrm{supp}(\mu)\implies\mu(A)=0.       The converse is not true in general: it fails if there exists a point x ∈ supp( μ ) such that μ ({ x }) = 0 (e.g. Lebesgue measure).  Thus, one does not need to "integrate outside the support": for any measurable function  f : X → R or C ,        ∫  X    f   (  x  )   d  μ   (  x  )     =    ∫   supp   (  μ  )      f   (  x  )   d  μ   (  x  )      .        subscript   X     f  x  normal-d  μ  x      subscript     supp  μ      f  x  normal-d  μ  x      \int_{X}f(x)\,\mathrm{d}\mu(x)=\int_{\mathrm{supp}(\mu)}f(x)\,\mathrm{d}\mu(x).        The concept of support of a measure and that of spectrum of a self-adjoint linear operator on a Hilbert space are closely related. Indeed, if   μ   μ   \mu   is a regular Borel measure on the line   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   , then the multiplication operator      (   A  f   )    (  x  )    =   x  f   (  x  )            A  f   x     x  f  x     (Af)(x)=xf(x)   is self-adjoint on its natural domain          D   (  A  )    =   {   f  ∈    L  2    (  ℝ  ,   d  μ   )     ∣    x  f   (  x  )    ∈    L  2    (  ℝ  ,   d  μ   )     }         D  A    conditional-set    f     superscript  L  2    ℝ    d  μ          x  f  x      superscript  L  2    ℝ    d  μ         D(A)=\{f\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},d\mu)\mid xf(x)\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R},d\mu)\}         and its spectrum coincides with the essential range of the identity function    x  ↦  x     maps-to  x  x    x\mapsto x   , which is precisely the support of   μ   μ   \mu   . 1    Examples  Lebesgue measure  In the case of Lebesgue measure λ on the real line R , consider an arbitrary point x ∈ R . Then any open neighbourhood N x of x must contain some open interval ( x − ε , x + ε ) for some ε > 0. This interval has Lebesgue measure 2 ε > 0, so λ ( N x ) ≥ 2 ε > 0. Since x ∈ R was arbitrary, supp( λ ) = R .  Dirac measure  In the case of Dirac measure δ p , let x ∈ R and consider two cases:   if x = p , then every open neighbourhood N x of x contains p , so δ p ( N x ) = 1 > 0;  on the other hand, if x ≠ p , then there exists a sufficiently small open ball B around x that does not contain p , so δ p ( B ) = 0.   We conclude that supp( δ p ) is the closure of the singleton set { p }, which is { p } itself.  In fact, a measure μ on the real line is a Dirac measure δ p for some point p  if and only if the support of μ is the singleton set { p }. Consequently, Dirac measure on the real line is the unique measure with zero variance [provided that the measure has variance at all].  A uniform distribution  Consider the measure μ on the real line R defined by       μ   (  A  )    :=   λ   (   A  ∩   (  0  ,  1  )    )       assign    μ  A     λ    A   0  1       \mu(A):=\lambda(A\cap(0,1))   i.e. a uniform measure on the open interval (0, 1). A similar argument to the Dirac measure example shows that supp( μ ) = [0, 1]. Note that the boundary points 0 and 1 lie in the support: any open set containing 0 (or 1) contains an open interval about 0 (or 1), which must intersect (0, 1), and so must have positive μ -measure.  A nontrivial measure whose support is empty  The space of all countable ordinals with the topology generated by "open intervals", is a locally compact Hausdorff space. The measure that assigns measure 1 to Borel sets containing an unbounded closed subset and assigns 0 to other Borel sets is a Borel probability measure whose support is empty.  A nontrivial measure whose support has measure zero  On a compact Hausdorff space the support of a non-zero measure is always non-empty, but may have measure 0. An example of this is given by adding the first uncountable ordinal Ω to the previous example: the support of the measure is the single point Ω, which has measure 0.  Signed and complex measures  Suppose that μ : Σ → [−∞, +∞] is a signed measure . Use the Hahn decomposition theorem to write       μ  =    μ  +   -   μ  -     ,      μ     superscript  μ     superscript  μ       \mu=\mu^{+}-\mu^{-},     where μ ± are both non-negative measures. Then the support of μ is defined to be        supp   (  μ  )    :=    supp   (   μ  +   )    ∪   supp   (   μ  -   )      .     assign    supp  μ       supp   superscript  μ       supp   superscript  μ        \mathrm{supp}(\mu):=\mathrm{supp}(\mu^{+})\cup\mathrm{supp}(\mu^{-}).     Similarly, if μ : Σ → C is a complex measure , the support of μ is defined to be the union of the supports of its real and imaginary parts.  References     (See chapter 2, section 2.)
