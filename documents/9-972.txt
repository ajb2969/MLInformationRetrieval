   Positive-definite kernel      Positive-definite kernel   In operator theory , a branch of mathematics , a positive definite kernel is a generalization of a positive-definite matrix .  Definition  Let       {   H  n   }    n  ∈  ℤ      subscript    subscript  H  n      n  ℤ     \{H_{n}\}_{n\in{\mathbb{Z}}}     be a sequence of (complex) Hilbert spaces and      ℒ   (   H  i   ,   H  j   )       ℒ    subscript  H  i    subscript  H  j      \mathcal{L}(H_{i},H_{j})     be the bounded operators from H i to H j .  A map A on    ℤ  ×  ℤ      ℤ  ℤ    {\mathbb{Z}}\times{\mathbb{Z}}   where       A   (  i  ,  j  )    ∈   ℒ   (   H  i   ,   H  j   )          A   i  j      ℒ    subscript  H  i    subscript  H  j       A(i,j)\in\mathcal{L}(H_{i},H_{j})     is called a positive definite kernel if for all m > 0 and     h  i   ∈   H  i        subscript  h  i    subscript  H  i     h_{i}\in H_{i}   , the following non-negativity condition holds:        ∑       -  m  ≤  i        j  ≤  m         ⟨   A   (  i  ,  j  )    h  i    ,   h  j   ⟩    ≥  0.        subscript    STACKED   fragments   m   i  italic-     j  m        A   i  j    subscript  h  i     subscript  h  j     0.    \sum_{-m\leq i\quad\,\atop j\leq m}\langle A(i,j)h_{i},h_{j}\rangle\geq 0.     Examples  Positive definite kernels provide a framework that encompasses some basic Hilbert space constructions.  Reproducing kernel Hilbert space  The definition and characterization of positive kernels extend verbatim to the case where the integers Z is replaced by an arbitrary set X . One can then give a fairly general procedure for constructing Hilbert spaces that is itself of some interest.  Consider the set F 0 ( X ) of complex-valued functions f : X → C with finite support . With the natural operations, F 0 ( X ) is called the free vector space generated by X . Let δ x be the element in F 0 ( X ) defined by δ x ( y ) = δ xy . The set { δ x } x ∈ X is a vector space basis of F 0 ( X ).  Suppose now K : X × X → C is a positive definite kernel, then the Kolmogorov decomposition of K gives a Hilbert space      (  ℋ  ,   ⟨  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ⟩   )     ℋ   normal-⋅  normal-⋅     ({\mathcal{H}},\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle)     where F 0 ( X ) is "dense" (after possibly taking quotients of the degenerate subspace). Also, ⟨[ δ x ], [ δ y ]⟩ = K ( x , y ), which is a special case of the square root factorization claim above. This Hilbert space is called the reproducing kernel Hilbert space with kernel K on the set X .  Notice that in this context, we have (from the definition above)       {   H  n   }    n  ∈  ℤ      subscript    subscript  H  n      n  ℤ     \{H_{n}\}_{n\in{\mathbb{Z}}}     being replaced by        {  ℂ  }    x  ∈  X    .     subscript   ℂ     x  X     \{{\mathbb{C}}\}_{x\in X}.     Thus the Kolmogorov decomposition, which is unique up to isomorphism, starts with F 0 ( X ).  One can readily show that every Hilbert space is isomorphic to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space on a set whose cardinality is the Hilbert space dimension of H . Let { e x } x ∈ X be an orthonormal basis of H . Then the kernel K defined by K ( x , y ) = ⟨ e x , e y ⟩ = δ xy reproduces a Hilbert space H . The bijection taking e x to δ x extends to a unitary operator from H to ''H' ''.  Direct sum and tensor product  Let H ( K , X ) denote the Hilbert space corresponding to a positive kernel K on X × X . The structure of H ( K , X ) is encoded in K . One can thus describe, for example, the direct sum and the tensor product of two Hilbert spaces via their kernels.  Consider two Hilbert spaces H ( K , X ) and H ( L , Y ). The disjoint union of X and Y is the set        X  ⊔  Y   =    {   (  x  ,  ξ  )   |   x  ∈  X   }   ∪   {   (  ξ  ,  y  )   |   y  ∈  Y   }     .       square-union  X  Y      conditional-set   x  ξ     x  X     conditional-set   ξ  y     y  Y       X\sqcup Y=\{(x,\xi)|x\in X\}\cup\{(\xi,y)|y\in Y\}.     Define a kernel      K  ⊕  L     direct-sum  K  L    K\oplus L     on this disjoint union in a way that is similar to direct sum of positive matrices, and the resulting Hilbert space      H   (   K  ⊕  L   ,   X  ⊔  Y   )       H    direct-sum  K  L    square-union  X  Y      H(K\oplus L,X\sqcup Y)     is then the direct sum, in the sense of Hilbert spaces, of H ( K , X ) and H ( L , Y ).  For the tensor product, a suitable kernel      K  ⊗  L     tensor-product  K  L    K\otimes L     is defined on the Cartesian product X × Y in a way that extends the Schur product of positive matrices:         (   K  ⊗  L   )    (   (  x  ,  y  )   ,   (   x  ′   ,   y  ′   )   )    =   K   (  x  ,   x  ′   )   L   (  y  ,   y  ′   )     .         tensor-product  K  L     x  y     superscript  x  normal-′    superscript  y  normal-′        K   x   superscript  x  normal-′    L   y   superscript  y  normal-′       (K\otimes L)((x,y),(x^{\prime},y^{\prime}))=K(x,x^{\prime})L(y,y^{\prime}).     This positive kernel gives the tensor product of H ( K , X ) and H ( L , Y ),      H   (   K  ⊗  L   ,   X  ×  Y   )       H    tensor-product  K  L     X  Y      H(K\otimes L,X\times Y)     in which the family { [ δ (x,y) ] } is a total set, i.e. its linear span is dense.  Characterization  Motivation  Consider a positive matrix A ∈ C n × n , whose entries are complex numbers. Every such matrix A has a "square root factorization" in the following sense:   A = B*B where B : C n → H A for some (finite-dimensional) Hilbert space H A .   Furthermore, if C and G is another pair, C an operator and G a Hilbert space, for which the above is true, then there exists a unitary operator U : G → H A such that B = UC .  The can be shown readily as follows. The matrix A induces a degenerate inner product A given by A = . Taking the quotient with respect to the degenerate subspace gives a Hilbert space H A , a typical element of which is an equivalence class we denote by [ x ].  Now let B : C n → H A be the natural projection map, Bx = [ x ]. One can calculate directly that       ⟨  x  ,    B  *   B  y   ⟩   =    ⟨   B  x   ,   B  y   ⟩   A   =    ⟨   [  x  ]   ,   [  y  ]   ⟩   A   =   ⟨  x  ,   A  y   ⟩          x     superscript  B    B  y     subscript     B  x     B  y    A         subscript    delimited-[]  x    delimited-[]  y    A         x    A  y       \langle x,B^{*}By\rangle=\langle Bx,By\rangle_{A}=\langle[x],[y]\rangle_{A}=%
 \langle x,Ay\rangle   .  So B*B = A . If C and G is another such pair, it is clear that the operator U : G → H A that takes [ x ] G in G to [ x ] in H A has the properties claimed above.  If { e i } is a given orthonormal basis of C n , then { B i = Be i } are the column vectors of B . The expression A = B*B can be rewritten as A i, j = B i *B j . By construction, H A is the linear span of { B i }.  Kolmogorov decomposition  This preceding discussion shows that every positive matrix A with complex entries can expressed as a Gramian matrix . A similar description can be obtained for general positive definite kernels, with an analogous argument. This is called the Kolmogorov decomposition :   Let A be a positive definite kernel. Then there exists a Hilbert space H A , and a map B defined on Z where B ( n ) lies in     ℒ   (   H  n   ,   H  A   )    ,      ℒ    subscript  H  n    subscript  H  A      \mathcal{L}(H_{n},H_{A}),   such that           A    (  i  ,  j  )    =     B  *    (  i  )   B   (  j  )    and      H  A   =    ⋁   n  ∈  ℤ     B   (  n  )     H  n        ,     formulae-sequence      A   i  j        superscript  B    i  B  j   and       subscript  H  A     subscript     n  ℤ      B  n   subscript  H  n        \quad A(i,j)=B^{*}(i)B(j)\quad\mbox{and}\quad H_{A}=\bigvee_{n\in{\mathbb{Z}}}%
 B(n)H_{n}\;,     where ⋁ denotes disjoint union as defined above. The condition that H A = ⋁ B ( n ) H n is referred to as the minimality condition . Similar to the scalar case, this requirement implies unitary freedom in the decomposition:   If there is a Hilbert space G and a map C on Z that gives a Kolmogorov decomposition of A , then there is a unitary operator        U  :    G  →    H  A   such that       U  C   (  n  )    =    B   (  n  )    for all     n  ∈  ℤ      .     normal-:  U   formulae-sequence   normal-→  G    subscript  H  A   such that     formulae-sequence      U  C  n      B  n   for all      n  ℤ       U:G\rightarrow H_{A}\quad\mbox{such that}\quad UC(n)=B(n)\quad\mbox{for all}%

Some applications  Stinespring dilation theorem  Embedding probability distributions in a RKHS  In machine learning , a class of algorithms based on the kernel embedding of distributions has been formulated to represent probability distributions as functions in a RKHS. This embedding thus allows manipulations of the distributions to be done via Hilbert space operations.  See also   Positive definite function on a group   References   D.E. Evans and J.T.
