Wagner model

Wagner model is a rheological model developed for the prediction of the viscoelastic properties of polymers. It might be considered as a simplified practical form of the Bernstein-Kearsley-Zapas model. The model was developed by German rheologist Manfred Wagner.
For the isothermal conditions the model can be written as:



where:



 
  is the Cauchy stress tensor as function of time t,
p is the pressure


 
  is the unity tensor
M is the memory function showing, usually expressed as a sum of exponential terms for each mode of relaxation:



 
 , where for each mode of the relaxation, 
 
 
 
  is the relaxation modulus and 
 
 
 
  is the relaxation time;



 
  is the strain damping function that depends upon the first and second invariants of Finger tensor

 
 .

The strain damping function is usually written as:


 
 , The strain hardening function equal to one, then the deformation is small and approaching zero, then the deformations are large.
The Wagner equation can be used in the non-isothermal cases by applying time-temperature shift factor.
