   Wagner model      Wagner model   Wagner model is a rheological model developed for the prediction of the viscoelastic properties of polymers. It might be considered as a simplified practical form of the Bernstein-Kearsley-Zapas model. The model was developed by German rheologist Manfred Wagner .  For the isothermal conditions the model can be written as:       σ   (  t  )    =    -   p  𝐈    +    ∫   -  ∞   t    M   (   t  -   t  ′    )   h   (   I  1   ,   I  2   )   𝐁   (   t  ′   )   d   t  ′            σ  t         p  𝐈      superscript   subscript        t     M    t   superscript  t  normal-′    h    subscript  I  1    subscript  I  2    𝐁   superscript  t  normal-′   d   superscript  t  normal-′        \mathbf{\sigma}(t)=-p\mathbf{I}+\int_{-\infty}^{t}M(t-t^{\prime})h(I_{1},I_{2}%
 )\mathbf{B}(t^{\prime})\,dt^{\prime}     where:       σ   (  t  )       σ  t    \mathbf{\sigma}(t)   is the Cauchy stress tensor as function of time t ,  p is the pressure     𝐈   𝐈   \mathbf{I}   is the unity tensor  M is the memory function showing, usually expressed as a sum of exponential terms for each mode of relaxation :        M   (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =  1   m      g  i    θ  i     exp   (    -  x    θ  i    )            M  x     superscript   subscript     k  1    m        subscript  g  i    subscript  θ  i          x    subscript  θ  i         M(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{m}\frac{g_{i}}{\theta_{i}}\exp(\frac{-x}{\theta_{i}})   , where for each mode of the relaxation,    g  i     subscript  g  i    g_{i}   is the relaxation modulus and    θ  i     subscript  θ  i    \theta_{i}   is the relaxation time;       h   (   I  1   ,   I  2   )       h    subscript  I  1    subscript  I  2      h(I_{1},I_{2})   is the strain damping function that depends upon the first and second invariants of Finger tensor    𝐁   𝐁   \mathbf{B}   .   The strain damping function is usually written as:       h   (   I  1   ,   I  2   )    =     m  *    exp   (   -    n  1      I  1   -  3      )     +    (   1  -   m  *    )    exp   (   -    n  2      I  2   -  3      )            h    subscript  I  1    subscript  I  2          superscript  m           subscript  n  1        subscript  I  1   3            1   superscript  m            subscript  n  2        subscript  I  2   3           h(I_{1},I_{2})=m^{*}\exp(-n_{1}\sqrt{I_{1}-3})+(1-m^{*})\exp(-n_{2}\sqrt{I_{2}%
 -3})   , The strain hardening function equal to one, then the deformation is small and approaching zero, then the deformations are large.  The Wagner equation can be used in the non-isothermal cases by applying time-temperature shift factor .  References   M.H. Wagner Rheologica Acta , v.15, 136 (1976)  M.H.
