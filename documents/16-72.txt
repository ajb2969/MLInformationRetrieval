Beta-chamigrene synthase




Beta-chamigrene synthase

Beta-chamigrene synthase () is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate lyase (cyclizing, (+)-beta-chamigrene-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (+)-beta-chamigrene + diphosphate


The recombinant enzyme from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana produces (+)-alpha-barbatene, (+)-thujopsene and (+)-beta-chamigrene.
