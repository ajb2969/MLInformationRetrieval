   Quasinorm      Quasinorm   In linear algebra , functional analysis and related areas of mathematics , a quasinorm is similar to a norm in that it satisfies the norm axioms, except that the triangle inequality is replaced by       ∥   x  +  y   ∥   ≤   K   (    ∥  x  ∥   +   ∥  y  ∥    )         norm    x  y      K     norm  x    norm  y       \|x+y\|\leq K(\|x\|+\|y\|)   for some    K  >  1.      K  1.    K>1.     This is not to be confused with a seminorm or pseudonorm , where the norm axioms are satisfied except for positive definiteness.  Related concepts  A vector space with an associated quasinorm is called a quasinormed vector space .  A complete quasinormed vector space is called a quasi-Banach space .  A quasinormed space    (  A  ,  ∥  ⋅  ∥  )     fragments  normal-(  A  normal-,  parallel-to  normal-⋅  parallel-to  normal-)    (A,\|\cdot\|)   is called a quasinormed algebra if the vector space A is an algebra and there is a constant K > 0 such that       ∥   x  y   ∥   ≤    K   ∥  x  ∥    ⋅   ∥  y  ∥         norm    x  y     normal-⋅    K   norm  x     norm  y      \|xy\|\leq K\|x\|\cdot\|y\|   for all     x  ,  y   ∈  A       x  y   A    x,y\in A   .
