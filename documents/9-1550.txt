   H-vector      H-vector   In algebraic combinatorics , the h -vector of a simplicial polytope is a fundamental invariant of the polytope which encodes the number of faces of different dimensions and allows one to express the Dehn–Sommerville equations in a particularly simple form. A characterization of the set of h -vectors of simplicial polytopes was conjectured by Peter McMullen and proved by Lou Billera and Carl W. Lee and Richard Stanley ( g -theorem ). The definition of h -vector applies to arbitrary abstract simplicial complexes . The g -conjecture states that for simplicial spheres , all possible h -vectors occur already among the h -vectors of the boundaries of convex simplicial polytopes.  Stanley introduced a generalization of the h -vector, the toric h -vector , which is defined for an arbitrary ranked poset , and proved that for the class of Eulerian posets , the Dehn–Sommerville equations continue to hold. A different, more combinatorial, generalization of the h -vector that has been extensively studied is the flag h -vector of a ranked poset. For Eulerian posets, it can be more concisely expressed by means of a noncommutative polynomial in two variables called the cd -index .  Definition  Let Δ be an abstract simplicial complex of dimension d − 1 with f i  i -dimensional faces and f −1 = 1. These numbers are arranged into the f -vector of Δ,        f   (  Δ  )    =   (   f   -  1    ,   f  0   ,  …  ,   f   d  -  1    )    .        f  normal-Δ     subscript  f    1     subscript  f  0   normal-…   subscript  f    d  1       f(\Delta)=(f_{-1},f_{0},\ldots,f_{d-1}).     An important special case occurs when Δ is the boundary of a d -dimensional convex polytope.  For k = 0, 1, …, d , let        h  k   =    ∑   i  =  0   k      (   -  1   )    k  -  i     (      d  -  i        k  -  i      )    f   i  -  1       .       subscript  h  k     superscript   subscript     i  0    k      superscript    1     k  i     binomial    d  i     k  i     subscript  f    i  1        h_{k}=\sum_{i=0}^{k}(-1)^{k-i}{\left({{d-i}\atop{k-i}}\right)}f_{i-1}.     The tuple       h   (  Δ  )    =   (   h  0   ,   h  1   ,  …  ,   h  d   )         h  normal-Δ     subscript  h  0    subscript  h  1   normal-…   subscript  h  d      h(\Delta)=(h_{0},h_{1},\ldots,h_{d})     is called the h -vector of Δ. The f -vector and the h -vector uniquely determine each other through the linear relation         ∑   i  =  0   d     f   i  -  1      (   t  -  1   )    d  -  i      =    ∑   k  =  0   d     h  k    t   d  -  k       .        superscript   subscript     i  0    d      subscript  f    i  1     superscript    t  1     d  i        superscript   subscript     k  0    d      subscript  h  k    superscript  t    d  k        \sum_{i=0}^{d}f_{i-1}(t-1)^{d-i}=\sum_{k=0}^{d}h_{k}t^{d-k}.     Let R = k [Δ] be the Stanley–Reisner ring of Δ. Then its Hilbert–Poincaré series can be expressed as         P  R    (  t  )    =    ∑   i  =  0   d      f   i  -  1     t  i      (   1  -  t   )   i     =     h  0   +    h  1   t   +  ⋯  +    h  d    t  d       (   1  -  t   )   d     .           subscript  P  R   t     superscript   subscript     i  0    d        subscript  f    i  1     superscript  t  i     superscript    1  t   i               subscript  h  0      subscript  h  1   t   normal-⋯     subscript  h  d    superscript  t  d      superscript    1  t   d       P_{R}(t)=\sum_{i=0}^{d}\frac{f_{i-1}t^{i}}{(1-t)^{i}}=\frac{h_{0}+h_{1}t+%
 \cdots+h_{d}t^{d}}{(1-t)^{d}}.     This motivates the definition of the h -vector of a finitely generated  positively graded algebra of Krull dimension  d as the numerator of its Hilbert–Poincaré series written with the denominator (1 − t ) d .  The h -vector is closely related to the h * -vector for a convex lattice polytope, see Ehrhart polynomial .  Toric h -vector  To an arbitrary graded poset P , Stanley associated a pair of polynomials f ( P , x ) and g ( P , x ). Their definition is recursive in terms of the polynomials associated to intervals [0,y] for all y ∈ P , y ≠ 1, viewed as ranked posets of lower rank (0 and 1 denote the minimal and the maximal elements of P ). The coefficients of f ( P , x ) form the toric h -vector of P . When P is an Eulerian poset of rank d + 1 such that P − 1 is simplicial, the toric h -vector coincides with the ordinary h -vector constructed using the numbers f i of elements of P − 1 of given rank i + 1. In this case the toric h -vector of P satisfies the Dehn–Sommerville equations        h  k   =   h   d  -  k     .       subscript  h  k    subscript  h    d  k      h_{k}=h_{d-k}.     The reason for the adjective "toric" is a connection of the toric h -vector with the intersection cohomology of a certain projective  toric variety  X whenever P is the boundary complex of rational convex polytope. Namely, the components are the dimensions of the even intersection cohomology groups of X :       h  k   =     dim  ℚ    IH   2  k      (  X  ,  ℚ  )         subscript  h  k      subscript  dim  ℚ    superscript  IH    2  k     X  ℚ     h_{k}=\operatorname{dim}_{\mathbb{Q}}\operatorname{IH}^{2k}(X,\mathbb{Q})     (the odd intersection cohomology groups of X are all zero). The Dehn–Sommerville equations are a manifestation of the Poincaré duality in the intersection cohomology of X .  Flag h -vector and cd -index  A different generalization of the notions of f -vector and h -vector of a convex polytope has been extensively studied. Let P be a finite graded poset of rank n − 1, so that each maximal chain in P has length n . For any S , a subset of {1,…, n }, let α P ( S ) denote the number of chains in P whose ranks constitute the set S . More formally, let      |  ⋅  |  :  P  →   {  0  ,  1  ,  …  ,  n  }      fragments  normal-|  normal-⋅  normal-|  normal-:  P  normal-→   fragments  normal-{  0  normal-,  1  normal-,  normal-…  normal-,  n  normal-}     |\cdot|:P\to\{0,1,\ldots,n\}     be the rank function of P and let P S be the S -rank selected subposet , which consists of the elements from P whose rank is in S :        P  S   =   {   x  ∈  P   :    |  x  |   ∈  S   }    .       subscript  P  S    conditional-set    x  P       x   S      P_{S}=\{x\in P:|x|\in S\}.     Then α P ( S ) is the number of the maximal chains in P  ( S ) and the function      S  ↦    α  P    (  S  )       maps-to  S     subscript  α  P   S     S\mapsto\alpha_{P}(S)     is called the flag f -vector of P . The function       S  ↦    β  P    (  S  )     ,     β  P    (  S  )    =    ∑   T  ⊆  S       (   -  1   )     |  S  |   -   |  T  |      α  P    (  S  )         formulae-sequence   maps-to  S     subscript  β  P   S         subscript  β  P   S     subscript     T  S       superscript    1       S     T      subscript  α  P   S       S\mapsto\beta_{P}(S),\quad\beta_{P}(S)=\sum_{T\subseteq S}(-1)^{|S|-|T|}\alpha%
 _{P}(S)     is called the flag h -vector of P . By the inclusion–exclusion principle ,         α  P    (  S  )    =    ∑   T  ⊆  S      β  P    (  T  )      .         subscript  α  P   S     subscript     T  S       subscript  β  P   T      \alpha_{P}(S)=\sum_{T\subseteq S}\beta_{P}(T).   The flag f - and h -vectors of P refine the ordinary f - and h -vectors of its order complex Δ( P ):          f   i  -  1     (   Δ   (  P  )    )    =    ∑    |  S  |   =  i      α  P    (  S  )      ,     h  i    (   Δ   (  P  )    )    =    ∑    |  S  |   =  i      β  P    (  S  )       .     formulae-sequence       subscript  f    i  1      normal-Δ  P      subscript       S   i       subscript  α  P   S          subscript  h  i     normal-Δ  P      subscript       S   i       subscript  β  P   S       f_{i-1}(\Delta(P))=\sum_{|S|=i}\alpha_{P}(S),\quad h_{i}(\Delta(P))=\sum_{|S|=%
 i}\beta_{P}(S).     The flag h -vector of P can be displayed via a polynomial in noncommutative variables a and b . For any subset S of {1,…, n }, define the corresponding monomial in a and b ,          u  S   =    u  1   ⋯   u  n     ,    u  i   =   a  for  i   ∉  S    ,    u  i   =   b  for  i   ∈  S    .     formulae-sequence   formulae-sequence     subscript  u  S      subscript  u  1   normal-⋯   subscript  u  n          subscript  u  i     a  for  i        S          subscript  u  i     b  for  i        S      u_{S}=u_{1}\cdots u_{n},\quad u_{i}=a\text{ for }i\notin S,u_{i}=b\text{ for }%
 i\in S.     Then the noncommutative generating function for the flag h -vector of P is defined by         Ψ  P    (  a  ,  b  )    =    ∑  S     β  P    (  S  )    u  S      .         subscript  normal-Ψ  P    a  b      subscript   S      subscript  β  P   S   subscript  u  S       \Psi_{P}(a,b)=\sum_{S}\beta_{P}(S)u_{S}.     From the relation between α P ( S ) and β P ( S ), the noncommutative generating function for the flag f -vector of P is         Ψ  P    (  a  ,   a  +  b   )    =    ∑  S     α  P    (  S  )    u  S      .         subscript  normal-Ψ  P    a    a  b       subscript   S      subscript  α  P   S   subscript  u  S       \Psi_{P}(a,a+b)=\sum_{S}\alpha_{P}(S)u_{S}.     Margaret Bayer and Lou Billera determined the most general linear relations that hold between the components of the flag h -vector of an Eulerian poset  P . Fine noted an elegant way to state these relations: there exists a noncommutative polynomial Φ P ( c , d ), called the cd -index of P , such that         Ψ  P    (  a  ,  b  )    =    Φ  P    (   a  +  b   ,    a  b   +   b  a    )     .         subscript  normal-Ψ  P    a  b       subscript  normal-Φ  P      a  b       a  b     b  a        \Psi_{P}(a,b)=\Phi_{P}(a+b,ab+ba).     Stanley proved that all coefficients of the cd -index of the boundary complex of a convex polytope are non-negative. He conjectured that this positivity phenomenon persists for a more general class of Eulerian posets that Stanley calls Gorenstein* complexes and which includes simplicial spheres and complete fans. This conjecture was proved by Kalle Karu. The combinatorial meaning of these non-negative coefficients (an answer to the question "what do they count?") remains unclear.  References    .   .   .
