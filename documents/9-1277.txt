   Discrete exterior calculus      Discrete exterior calculus   In mathematics , the discrete exterior calculus ( DEC ) is the extension of the exterior calculus to discrete spaces including graphs and finite element meshes . DEC methods have proved to be very powerful in improving and analyzing finite element methods: for instance, DEC-based methods allow the use of highly non-uniform meshes to obtain accurate results. Non-uniform meshes are advantageous because they allow the use of large elements where the process to be simulated is relatively simple, as opposed to a fine resolution where the process may be complicated (e.g., near an obstruction to a fluid flow), while using less computational power than if a uniformly fine mesh were used.  The discrete exterior derivative  Stokes' theorem relates the integral of a differential ( n − 1)-form  ω over the boundary ∂ M of an n - dimensional manifold M to the integral of d ω (the exterior derivative of ω , and a differential n -form on M ) over M itself:         ∫  M    d  ω    =    ∫   ∂  M    ω    .        subscript   M     normal-d  ω      subscript     M    ω     \int_{M}\mathrm{d}\omega=\int_{\partial M}\omega.     One could think of differential k -forms as linear operators that act on k -dimensional "bits" of space, in which case one might prefer to use the bra–ket notation for a dual pairing. In this notation, Stokes' theorem reads as        ⟨   d  ω   ∣  M  ⟩   =   ⟨  ω  ∣   ∂  M   ⟩    .       inner-product    normal-d  ω   M    inner-product  ω    M      \langle\mathrm{d}\omega\mid M\rangle=\langle\omega\mid\partial M\rangle.     In finite element analysis, the first stage is often the approximation of the domain of interest by a triangulation , T . For example, a curve would be approximated as a union of straight line segments; a surface would be approximated by a union of triangles, whose edges are straight line segments, which themselves terminate in points. Topologists would refer to such a construction as a simplicial complex . The boundary operator on this triangulation/simplicial complex T is defined in the usual way: for example, if L is a directed line segment from one point, a , to another, b , then the boundary ∂ L of L is the formal difference b − a .  A k -form on T is a linear operator acting on k -dimensional subcomplexes of T ; e.g., a 0-form assigns values to points, and extends linearly to linear combinations of points; a 1-form assigns values to line segments in a similarly linear way. If S is a ( k + 1)-dimensional subcomplex of T and ω is a k -form on T , then the discrete exterior derivative d ω of ω is the unique ( k + 1)-form defined so that Stokes' theorem holds:        ⟨   d  ω   ∣  S  ⟩   =   ⟨  ω  ∣   ∂  S   ⟩    .       inner-product    normal-d  ω   S    inner-product  ω    S      \langle\mathrm{d}\omega\mid S\rangle=\langle\omega\mid\partial S\rangle.     Other concepts such as the discrete wedge product and the discrete Hodge star can also be defined.
