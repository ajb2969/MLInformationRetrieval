Circle packing in a square

Circle packing in a square is a packing problem in recreational mathematics, where the aim is to pack n unit circles into the smallest possible square; or, equivalently, to arrange n points in a unit square for the greatest minimal separation, dn, between points.1 To convert between these two formulations of the problem, the square side for unit circles will be
