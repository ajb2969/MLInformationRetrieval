Scattering rate

The interaction picture
Define the unperturbed Hamiltonian by 
 
 
 
 , the time dependent perturbing Hamiltonian by 
 
 
 
  and total Hamiltonian by 
 
 
 
 .
The eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian are assumed to be






In the interaction picture, the state ket is defined by



By a Schrödinger equation, we see


 
  which is a Schrödinger-like equation with the total 
 
 
 
  replaced by 
 
 
 
 
 .
Solving the differential equation, we can find the coefficient of n-state.



where, the zeroth-order term and first-order term are






The transition rate
The probability of finding 
 
 
 
  is found by evaluating 
 
 
 
 
 .
In case of constant perturbation,
 
 
 
  is calculated by






Using the equation which is



The transition rate of an electron from the initial state 
 
 
 
  to final state 
 
 
 
  is given by



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the energies of the initial and final states including the perturbation state and ensures the 
 
 
 
 -function indicate energy conservation.
The scattering rate
The scattering rate w(k) is determined by summing all the possible finite states k' of electron scattering from an initial state k to a final state k', and is defined by



The integral form is
