   SMASH (hash)      SMASH (hash)   SMASH is a cryptographic hash function which was created by Lars R. Knudsen . 1 SMASH comes in two versions: 256-bit and 512-bit. Each version was supposed to rival SHA-256 and SHA-512 , respectively, however, shortly after the SMASH presentation at FSE 2005 , an attack vector against SMASH was discovered which left the hash broken.  Specifications  The message length was limited to less than 2 128 for SMASH-256 and 2 256 for SMASH-512.  Definition  Input: 256/512-bit message blocks     m  1   ,   m  2   ,  …  ,   m  t       subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2   normal-…   subscript  m  t     m_{1},m_{2},...,m_{t}   and    θ  ∈   G  F   (   2  n   )        θ    G  F   superscript  2  n      \theta\in GF(2^{n})           h  0   =    f   (   i  v   )    ⊕   i  v         subscript  h  0    direct-sum    f    i  v      i  v      h_{0}=f(iv)\oplus iv          h  i   =   h   (   h   i  -  1    ,   m  i   )    =    f   (    h   i  1    ⊕   m  i    )    ⊕   m  i   ⊕   θ   m  i            subscript  h  i     h    subscript  h    i  1     subscript  m  i           direct-sum    f   direct-sum   subscript  h   subscript  i  1     subscript  m  i      subscript  m  i     θ   subscript  m  i        h_{i}=h(h_{i-1},m_{i})=f(h_{i_{1}}\oplus m_{i})\oplus m_{i}\oplus\theta m_{i}          h   t  +  1    =    f   (   h  t   )    ⊕   h  t         subscript  h    t  1     direct-sum    f   subscript  h  t     subscript  h  t      h_{t+1}=f(h_{t})\oplus h_{t}      The function f is a complex compression function consisting of H-Rounds and L-Rounds using S-boxes , linear diffusion and variable rotations, details can be found here 2  Details  The S-boxes in SMASH are derived versions from the Serpent ones.
