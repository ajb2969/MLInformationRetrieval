   Demihypercube      Demihypercube   In geometry , demihypercubes (also called n-demicubes , n-hemicubes , and half measure polytopes ) are a class of n- polytopes constructed from alternation of an n- hypercube , labeled as hγ n for being half of the hypercube family, γ n . Half of the vertices are deleted and new facets are formed. The 2n facets become 2n  (n-1)-demicubes , and 2 n  (n-1)-simplex facets are formed in place of the deleted vertices. 1  They have been named with a demi- prefix to each hypercube name: demicube, demitesseract, etc. The demicube is identical to the regular tetrahedron , and the demitesseract is identical to the regular 16-cell . The demipenteract is considered semiregular for having only regular facets. Higher forms don't have all regular facets but are all uniform polytopes .  The vertices and edges of a demihypercube form two copies of the halved cube graph .  Discovery  Thorold Gosset described the demipenteract in his 1900 publication listing all of the regular and semiregular figures in n-dimensions above 3. He called it a 5-ic semi-regular . It also exists within the semiregular k 21 polytope family.  The demihypercubes can be represented by extended Schläfli symbols of the form h{4,3,...,3} as half the vertices of {4,3,...,3}. The vertex figures of demihypercubes are rectified n- simplexes .  Constructions  They are represented by Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams of three constructive forms:    ... (As an alternated  orthotope ) s{2 1,1...,1 }   ... (As an alternated hypercube ) h{4,3 n-1 }   .... (As a demihypercube) {3 1,n-3,1 }   H.S.M. Coxeter also labeled the third bifurcating diagrams as 1 k1 representing the lengths of the 3 branches and lead by the ringed branch.  An n-demicube , n greater than 2, has n*(n-1)/2 edges meeting at each vertex. The graphs below show less edges at each vertex due to overlapping edges in the symmetry projection.      n   1 k1    Petrie polygon   Schläfli symbol   Coxeter diagrams A 1 n B n D n   Elements   Facets : Demihypercubes & Simplexes   Vertex figure       Vertices   Edges   Faces   Cells   4-faces   5-faces   6-faces   7-faces     2   1 -1,1   demisquare ( digon )    s{2} h{4} {3 1,-1,1 }       2   2        3   1 01   demicube ( tetrahedron )    s{2 1,1 } h{4,3} {3 1,0,1 }       4   6   4     4   1 11   demitesseract ( 16-cell )    s{2 1,1,1 } h{4,3,3} {3 1,1,1 }       8   24   32     5   1 21   demipenteract    s{2 1,1,1,1 } h{4,3 3 }{3 1,2,1 }       16   80   160     6   1 31   demihexeract    s{2 1,1,1,1,1 } h{4,3 4 }{3 1,3,1 }       32   240   640     7   1 41   demihepteract    s{2 1,1,1,1,1,1 } h{4,3 5 }{3 1,4,1 }       64   672   2240     8   1 51   demiocteract    s{2 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 } h{4,3 6 }{3 1,5,1 }       128   1792   7168     9   1 61   demienneract    s{2 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 } h{4,3 7 }{3 1,6,1 }       256   4608   21504     10   1 71   demidekeract    s{2 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 } h{4,3 8 }{3 1,7,1 }       512   11520   61440     ...     n   1 n-3,1   n-demicube   s{2 1,1,...,1 } h{4,3 n-2 }{3 1,n-3,1 }   ... ... ...   2 n-1      n (n-1)-demicubes 2 n (n-1)- simplices     In general, a demicube's elements can be determined from the original n-cube: (With C n,m = m th -face count in n-cube = 2 n-m *n!/(m!*(n-m)!))

Facets: D n,n-1 = n + 2 n ((n-1)-demicubes and (n-1)-simplices respectively)   Symmetry group  The symmetry group of the demihypercube is the Coxeter group      D  n   ,     subscript  D  n    D_{n},   [3 n-3,1,1 ] has order      2   n  -  1     n  !    ,       superscript  2    n  1      n     2^{n-1}n!,   and is an index 2 subgroup of the hyperoctahedral group (which is the Coxeter group    B   C  n       B   subscript  C  n     BC_{n}   [4,3 n-1 ]).  Orthotopic constructions  (Figure)  The rhombic disphenoid inside of a cuboid   Constructions as alternated orthotopes have the same topology, but can be stretched with different lengths in n -axes of symmetry.  The rhombic disphenoid is the three-dimensional example as alternated cuboid. It has three sets of edge lengths, and scalene triangle faces.
