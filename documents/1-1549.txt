   Great circle      Great circle   (Figure)  A great circle divides the sphere in two equal hemispheres   A great circle , also known as an orthodrome or Riemannian circle , of a sphere is the intersection of the sphere and a plane which passes through the center point of the sphere. This partial case of a circle of a sphere is opposed to a small circle , the intersection of the sphere and a plane which does not pass through the center. Any diameter of any great circle coincides with a diameter of the sphere, and therefore all great circles have the same circumference as each other, and have the same center as the sphere. A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on any given sphere. Every circle in Euclidean 3-space is a great circle of exactly one sphere.  For most pairs of points on the surface of a sphere there is a unique great circle through the two points. The exception is a pair of antipodal points, for which there are infinitely many great circles. The minor arc of a great circle between two points is the shortest surface-path between them. In this sense the minor arc is analogous to “straight lines” in Euclidean geometry . The length of the minor arc of a great circle is taken as the distance between two points on a surface of a sphere in Riemannian geometry . The great circles are the geodesics of the sphere.  In higher dimensions, the great circles on the n -sphere are the intersection of the n -sphere with 2-planes that pass through the origin in the Euclidean space R n +1 .  Derivation of shortest paths  To prove that the minor arc of a great circle is the shortest path connecting two points on the surface of a sphere, one has to apply calculus of variations to it.  Consider the class of all regular paths from a point p to another point q . Introduce spherical coordinates so that p coincides with the north pole. Any curve on the sphere that does not intersect either pole, except possibly at the endpoints, can be parametrized by       θ  =   θ   (  t  )     ,    ϕ  =   ϕ   (  t  )     ,   a  ≤  t  ≤  b       formulae-sequence    θ    θ  t     formulae-sequence    ϕ    ϕ  t        a  t       b       \theta=\theta(t),\quad\phi=\phi(t),\quad a\leq t\leq b     provided we allow φ to take on arbitrary real values. The infinitesimal arc length in these coordinates is        d  s   =   r      θ   ′  2    +    ϕ   ′  2      sin  2   θ       d  t    .        d  s     r       superscript  θ   normal-′  2       superscript  ϕ   normal-′  2      superscript   2   θ      d  t     ds=r\sqrt{\theta^{\prime 2}+\phi^{\prime 2}\sin^{2}\theta}\,dt.     So the length of a curve γ from p to q is a functional of the curve given by        S   [  γ  ]    =   r    ∫  a  b        θ   ′  2    +    ϕ   ′  2      sin  2   θ       d  t      .        S   delimited-[]  γ      r    superscript   subscript   a   b          superscript  θ   normal-′  2       superscript  ϕ   normal-′  2      superscript   2   θ      d  t       S[\gamma]=r\int_{a}^{b}\sqrt{\theta^{\prime 2}+\phi^{\prime 2}\sin^{2}\theta}%
 \,dt.     Note that S [γ] is at least the length of the meridian from p to q :        S   [  γ  ]    ≥   r    ∫  a  b     |    θ  ′    (  t  )    |   d  t     ≥   r   |    θ   (  b  )    -   θ   (  a  )     |     .          S   delimited-[]  γ      r    superscript   subscript   a   b          superscript  θ  normal-′   t    d  t            r        θ  b     θ  a         S[\gamma]\geq r\int_{a}^{b}|\theta^{\prime}(t)|\,dt\geq r|\theta(b)-\theta(a)|.     Since the starting point and ending point are fixed, S is minimized if and only if φ' = 0, so the curve must lie on a meridian of the sphere φ = φ 0 = constant. In Cartesian coordinates, this is        x   sin   ϕ  0     -   y   cos   ϕ  0      =  0          x     subscript  ϕ  0       y     subscript  ϕ  0      0    x\sin\phi_{0}-y\cos\phi_{0}=0   which is a plane through the origin, i.e., the center of the sphere.  Applications  Some examples of great circles on the celestial sphere include the celestial horizon , the celestial equator , and the ecliptic . Great circles are also used as rather accurate approximations of geodesics on the Earth 's surface (although it is not a perfect sphere ), as well as on spheroidal celestial bodies .
