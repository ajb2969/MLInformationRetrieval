   Continuous linear extension      Continuous linear extension   In functional analysis , it is often convenient to define a linear transformation on a complete , normed vector space    X   X   X   by first defining a linear transformation   𝖳   𝖳   \mathsf{T}   on a dense  subset of   X   X   X   and then extending   𝖳   𝖳   \mathsf{T}   to the whole space via the theorem below. The resulting extension remains linear and bounded (thus continuous ).  This procedure is known as continuous linear extension .  Theorem  Every bounded linear transformation   𝖳   𝖳   \mathsf{T}   from a normed vector space   X   X   X   to a complete, normed vector space   Y   Y   Y   can be uniquely extended to a bounded linear transformation    𝖳  ~     normal-~  𝖳    \tilde{\mathsf{T}}   from the completion of   X   X   X   to   Y   Y   Y   . In addition, the operator norm of   𝖳   𝖳   \mathsf{T}   is   c   c   c    iff the norm of    𝖳  ~     normal-~  𝖳    \tilde{\mathsf{T}}   is   c   c   c   .  This theorem is sometimes called the B L T theorem, where B L T stands for bounded linear transformation .  Application  Consider, for instance, the definition of the Riemann integral . A step function on a closed  interval     [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   is a function of the form    f  ≡     r  1    1   [  a  ,   x  1   )     +    r  2    1   [   x  1   ,   x  2   )     +  ⋯  +    r  n    1   [   x   n  -  1    ,  b  ]          f       subscript  r  1    subscript  1   a   subscript  x  1         subscript  r  2    subscript  1    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2      normal-⋯     subscript  r  n    subscript  1    subscript  x    n  1    b        f\equiv r_{1}\mathit{1}_{[a,x_{1})}+r_{2}\mathit{1}_{[x_{1},x_{2})}+\cdots+r_{%
 n}\mathit{1}_{[x_{n-1},b]}   where     r  1   ,  …  ,   r  n       subscript  r  1   normal-…   subscript  r  n     r_{1},\ldots,r_{n}   are real numbers,   S   S   S   denotes the indicator function of the set    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   . The space of all step functions on    L  ∞     superscript  L     L^{\infty}   , normed by the   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   norm (see Lp space ), is a normed vector space which we denote by     𝖨   (    ∑   i  =  1   n     r  i    1   [   x   i  -  1    ,   x  i   )      )    =    ∑   i  =  1   n     r  i    (    x  i   -   x   i  -  1     )           𝖨    superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  r  i    subscript  1    subscript  x    i  1     subscript  x  i          superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  r  i      subscript  x  i    subscript  x    i  1         \mathsf{I}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}r_{i}\mathit{1}_{[x_{i-1},x_{i})}\right)=\sum_{i%
 =1}^{n}r_{i}(x_{i}-x_{i-1})   . Define the integral of a step function by   𝖨   𝖨   \mathsf{I}   .   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   as a function is a bounded linear transformation from   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   into    𝒫  𝒞      𝒫  𝒞    \mathcal{PC}   . 1  Let    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   denote the space of bounded, piecewise continuous functions on    L  ∞     superscript  L     L^{\infty}   that are continuous from the right, along with the   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   norm. The space    𝒫  𝒞      𝒫  𝒞    \mathcal{PC}   is dense in   𝖨   𝖨   \mathsf{I}   , so we can apply the B.L.T. theorem to extend the linear transformation    𝖨  ~     normal-~  𝖨    \tilde{\mathsf{I}}   to a bounded linear transformation    𝒫  𝒞      𝒫  𝒞    \mathcal{PC}   from   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   to    𝒫  𝒞      𝒫  𝒞    \mathcal{PC}   . This defines the Riemann integral of all functions in    f  ∈   𝒫  𝒞       f    𝒫  𝒞     f\in\mathcal{PC}   ; for every      ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )   d  x    =    𝖨  ~    (  f  )          superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x  d  x       normal-~  𝖨   f     \int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=\tilde{\mathsf{I}}(f)   ,    T  :   S  →  Y      normal-:  T   normal-→  S  Y     T:S\rightarrow Y   .  The Hahn–Banach theorem  The above theorem can be used to extend a bounded linear transformation     S  ¯   =  X       normal-¯  S   X    \bar{S}=X   to a bounded linear transformation from   Y   Y   Y   to   S   S   S   , if    X   X   X   is dense in   S   S   S   . If   X   X   X   is not dense in   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   , then the Hahn–Banach theorem may sometimes be used to show that an extension exists . However, the extension may not be unique.
