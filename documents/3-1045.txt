Continuous linear extension

In functional analysis, it is often convenient to define a linear transformation on a complete, normed vector space

 
  by first defining a linear transformation 
 
 
 
  on a dense subset of 
 
 
 
  and then extending 
 
 
 
  to the whole space via the theorem below. The resulting extension remains linear and bounded (thus continuous).
This procedure is known as continuous linear extension.
Theorem
Every bounded linear transformation 
 
 
 
  from a normed vector space 
 
 
 
  to a complete, normed vector space 
 
 
 
  can be uniquely extended to a bounded linear transformation 
 
 
 
  from the completion of 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . In addition, the operator norm of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
iff the norm of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 .
This theorem is sometimes called the B L T theorem, where B L T stands for bounded linear transformation.
Application
Consider, for instance, the definition of the Riemann integral. A step function on a closed interval

 
  is a function of the form
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  are real numbers, 
 
 
 
  denotes the indicator function of the set 
 
 
 
 . The space of all step functions on 
 
 
 
 , normed by the 
 
 
 
  norm (see Lp space), is a normed vector space which we denote by 
 
 
 
 . Define the integral of a step function by
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  as a function is a bounded linear transformation from 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
 .1
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the space of bounded, piecewise continuous functions on 
 
 
 
  that are continuous from the right, along with the 
 
 
 
  norm. The space 
 
 
 
  is dense in 
 
 
 
 , so we can apply the B.L.T. theorem to extend the linear transformation 
 
 
 
  to a bounded linear transformation 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . This defines the Riemann integral of all functions in 
 
 
 
 ; for every 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
The Hahn–Banach theorem
The above theorem can be used to extend a bounded linear transformation 
 
 
 
  to a bounded linear transformation from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , if

 
  is dense in 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is not dense in 
 
 
 
 , then the Hahn–Banach theorem may sometimes be used to show that an extension exists. However, the extension may not be unique.
