Syndetic set

In mathematics, a syndetic set is a subset of the natural numbers, having the property of "bounded gaps": that the sizes of the gaps in the sequence of natural numbers is bounded.
Definition
A set 
 
 
 
  is called syndetic if for some finite subset F of 
 
 




where 
 
 
 
 . Thus syndetic sets have "bounded gaps"; for a syndetic set 
 
 
 
 , there is an integer 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for any
