   Syndetic set      Syndetic set   In mathematics , a syndetic set is a subset of the natural numbers , having the property of "bounded gaps": that the sizes of the gaps in the sequence of natural numbers is bounded.  Definition  A set    S   \sub   ℕ      S  \sub  ℕ    S\sub\mathbb{N}   is called syndetic if for some finite subset F of   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}           ⋃   n  ∈  F     (   S  -  n   )    =  ℕ        subscript     n  F      S  n    ℕ    \bigcup_{n\in F}(S-n)=\mathbb{N}     where     S  -  n   =   {   m  ∈  ℕ   :    m  +  n   ∈  S   }         S  n    conditional-set    m  ℕ       m  n   S      S-n=\{m\in\mathbb{N}:m+n\in S\}   . Thus syndetic sets have "bounded gaps"; for a syndetic set   S   S   S   , there is an integer    p  =   p   (  S  )        p    p  S     p=p(S)   such that      [  a  ,   a  +  1   ,   a  +  2   ,  …  ,   a  +  p   ]    ⋂  S    ≠  ∅         a    a  1     a  2   normal-…    a  p      S       [a,a+1,a+2,...,a+p]\bigcap S\neq\emptyset   for any    a  ∈  ℕ      a  ℕ    a\in\mathbb{N}   .
