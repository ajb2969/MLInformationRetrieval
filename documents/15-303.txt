   Fractal derivative      Fractal derivative   In applied mathematics and mathematical analysis , the fractal derivative is a nonstandard type of derivative in which the variable such as t has been scaled according to t α . The derivative is defined in fractal geometry.  Physical background  Porous media , aquifer , turbulence and other media usually exhibit fractal properties. The classical physical laws such as Fick's laws of diffusion , Darcy's law and Fourier's law are no longer applicable for such media, because they are based on Euclidean geometry , which doesn't apply to media of non- integer  fractal dimensions . The basic physical concepts such as distance and velocity in fractal media are required to be redefined; the scales for space and time should be transformed according to ( x β , t α ). The elementary physical concepts such as velocity in a fractal spacetime ( x β , t α ) can be redefined by:        v  ′   =    d   x  ′     d   t  ′     =     d   x  β     d   t  α       ,    α  ,  β   >  0      formulae-sequence       superscript  v  normal-′       d   superscript  x  normal-′      d   superscript  t  normal-′              d   superscript  x  β      d   superscript  t  α          α  β   0     v^{\prime}=\frac{dx^{\prime}}{dt^{\prime}}=\frac{dx^{\beta}}{dt^{\alpha}}\,,%
 \quad\alpha,\beta>0   ,  where S α,β represents the fractal spacetime with scaling indices α and β . The traditional definition of velocity makes no sense in the non-differentiable fractal spacetime.  Definition  Based on above discussion, the concept of the fractal derivative of a function u ( t ) with respect to a fractal measure t has been introduced as follows:          ∂  f    (  t  )     ∂   t  α     =    lim    t  1   →  t        f   (   t  1   )    -   f   (  t  )       t  1  α   -   t  α        ,   α  >  0      formulae-sequence          f   t      superscript  t  α       subscript    normal-→   subscript  t  1   t          f   subscript  t  1      f  t       superscript   subscript  t  1   α    superscript  t  α         α  0     \frac{\partial f(t)}{\partial t^{\alpha}}=\lim_{t_{1}\rightarrow t}\frac{f(t_{%
 1})-f(t)}{t_{1}^{\alpha}-t^{\alpha}}\,,\quad\alpha>0   ,  A more general definition is given by           ∂  β   f    (  t  )     ∂   t  α     =    lim    t  1   →  t         f  β    (   t  1   )    -    f  β    (  t  )       t  1  α   -   t  α        ,    α  >  0   ,   β  >  0       formulae-sequence          superscript   β   f   t      superscript  t  α       subscript    normal-→   subscript  t  1   t           superscript  f  β    subscript  t  1       superscript  f  β   t       superscript   subscript  t  1   α    superscript  t  α        formulae-sequence    α  0     β  0      \frac{\partial^{\beta}f(t)}{\partial t^{\alpha}}=\lim_{t_{1}\rightarrow t}%

In addition, the authors make elementary mistakes, since does not take into account that it should be used ( x>0 , t>0 ) to consider fractional powers.  Application in anomalous diffusion  As an alternative modeling approach to the classical Fick’s second law, the fractal derivative is used to derive a linear anomalous transport-diffusion equation underlying anomalous diffusion process,          d  u   (  x  ,  t  )     d   t  α     =   D   ∂   ∂   x  β      (     ∂  u    (  x  ,  t  )     ∂   x  β     )     ,    -  ∞   <  x  <   +   ∞      ,   (  1  )      formulae-sequence   formulae-sequence        d  u   x  t      d   superscript  t  α       D        superscript  x  β           u    x  t       superscript  x  β               x              1    \frac{du(x,t)}{dt^{\alpha}}=D\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\beta}}\left(\frac{%
 \partial u(x,t)}{\partial x^{\beta}}\right),-\infty           u   (  x  ,  0  )    =   δ   (  x  )     .        u   x  0      δ  x     u(x,0)=\delta(x).     where 0 t'=t^\alpha\,,\quad x'=x^\beta.  then the equation (1) becomes the normal diffusion form equation, the solution of (1) has the stretched Gaussian form:       u   (  x  ,  t  )    =    1   2    π   t  α        e   -    x   2  β     4   t  α              u   x  t        1    2      π   superscript  t  α        superscript  e       superscript  x    2  β      4   superscript  t  α          u(x,t)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi t^{\alpha}}}e^{-\frac{x^{2\beta}}{4t^{\alpha}}}     The mean squared displacement of above fractal derivative diffusion equation has the asymptote :        ⟨    x  2    (  t  )    ⟩   ∝   t     (    3  α   -   α  β    )   /  2   β     .     proportional-to   delimited-⟨⟩     superscript  x  2   t     superscript  t          3  α     α  β    2   β      \left\langle x^{2}(t)\right\rangle\propto t^{(3\alpha-\alpha\beta)/2\beta}.
