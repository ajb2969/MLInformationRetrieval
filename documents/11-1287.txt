   Indole-3-acetate beta-glucosyltransferase      Indole-3-acetate beta-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , an indole-3-acetate beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + (indol-3-yl)acetate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 1-O-(indol-3-yl)acetyl-beta-D-glucose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and (indol-3-yl)acetate , whereas its two products are UDP and 1-O-(indol-3-yl)acetyl-beta-D-glucose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:(indol-3-yl)acetate beta-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-indoleacetate glucosyltransferase , UDPG-indol-3-ylacetyl glucosyl transferase , UDP-glucose:indol-3-ylacetate glucosyltransferase , indol-3-ylacetylglucose synthase , UDP-glucose:indol-3-ylacetate glucosyl-transferase , IAGlu synthase , IAA-glucose synthase , and UDP-glucose:indole-3-acetate beta-D-glucosyltransferase .
