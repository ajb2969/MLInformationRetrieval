   Oscillator representation      Oscillator representation   In mathematics , the oscillator representation is a projective unitary representation of the symplectic group , first investigated by Irving Segal , David Shale, and André Weil . A natural extension of the representation leads to a semigroup of contraction operators , introduced as the oscillator semigroup by Roger Howe in 1988. The semigroup had previously been studied by other mathematicians and physicists, most notably Felix Berezin in the 1960s. The simplest example in one dimension is given by SU(1,1) . It acts as Möbius transformations on the extended complex plane , leaving the unit circle invariant. In that case the oscillator representation is a unitary representation of a double cover of SU(1,1) and the oscillator semigroup corresponds to a representation by contraction operators of the semigroup in SL(2, C ) corresponding to Möbius transformations that take the unit disk into itself. The contraction operators, determined only up to a sign, have kernels that are Gaussian functions . On an infinitesimal level the semigroup is described by a cone in the Lie algebra of SU(1,1) that can be identified with a light cone . The same framework generalizes to the symplectic group in higher dimensions, including its analogue in infinite dimensions. This article explains the theory for SU(1,1) in detail and summarizes how the theory can be extended.  Historical overview  The mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics by Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger was originally in terms of unbounded  self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space . The fundamental operators corresponding to position and momentum satisfy the Heisenberg commutation relations . Quadratic polynomials in these operators, which include the harmonic oscillator , are also closed under taking commutators. A large amount of operator theory was developed in the 1920s and 1930s to provide a rigorous foundation for quantum mechanics. Part of the theory was formulated in terms of unitary groups of operators, largely through the contributions of Hermann Weyl , Marshall Stone and John von Neumann . In turn these results in mathematical physics were subsumed within mathematical analysis, starting with the 1933 lecture notes of Norbert Wiener , who used the heat kernel for the harmonic oscillator to derive the properties of the Fourier transform . The uniqueness of the Heisenberg commutation relations, as formulated in the Stone–von Neumann theorem , was later interpreted within group representation theory , in particular the theory of induced representations initiated by George Mackey . The quadratic operators were understood in terms of a projective unitary representation of the group SU(1,1) and its Lie algebra . Irving Segal and David Shale generalized this construction to the symplectic group in finite and infinite dimensions: in physics this is often referred to as bosonic quantization . André Weil later extended the construction to p-adic Lie groups , showing how the ideas could be applied in number theory , in particular to give a group theoretic explanation of theta functions and quadratic reciprocity . Several physicists and mathematicians observed the heat kernel operators corresponding to the harmonic oscillator were associated to a complexification of SU(1,1): this was not the whole of SL(2, C ), but instead a complex semigroup defined by a natural geometric condition. The representation theory of this semigroup, and its generalizations in finite and infinite dimensions, has applications both in mathematics and theoretical physics. 1  Semigroups in SL(2,C)  The group G = SU(1,1) is formed of matrices      (     α    β       β  ¯      α  ¯      )      α  β     normal-¯  β    normal-¯  α      \begin{pmatrix}\alpha&\beta\\
 \overline{\beta}&\overline{\alpha}\end{pmatrix}     with         |  α  |   2   -    |  β  |   2    =  1.         superscript    α   2    superscript    β   2    1.    |\alpha|^{2}-|\beta|^{2}=1.     It is a subgroup of G c = SL(2, C ), the group of complex 2 × 2 matrices with determinant 1.  If G 1 = SL(2, R ) and      C  =   (     1    i      i    1     )       C    1  i    i  1      C=\begin{pmatrix}1&i\\
 i&1\end{pmatrix}     then       G  =   C   G  1    C   -  1      ,      G    C   subscript  G  1    superscript  C    1       G=CG_{1}C^{-1},     since the Möbius transformation corresponding M is the Cayley transform carrying the upper half plane onto the unit disk and the real line onto the unit circle.  The group SL(2, R ) is generated as an abstract group by      J  =   (     0    1       -  1     0     )       J    0  1      1   0      J=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\
 -1&0\end{pmatrix}     and the subgroup of lower triangular matrices      (     a    0      b     a   -  1       )      a  0    b   superscript  a    1       \displaystyle{\begin{pmatrix}a&0\\
 b&a^{-1}\end{pmatrix}}     with b real and a > 0. Indeed the orbit of the vector      v  =   (     0      1     )       v    0    1      \displaystyle{v=\begin{pmatrix}0\\
 1\end{pmatrix}}     under the subgroup generated by these matrices is easily seen to be the whole of R 2 and the stabilizer of v in G 1 lies in inside this subgroup.  The Lie algebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   of SU(1,1) consists of matrices      (      i  x     w       w  ¯      -   i  x       )        i  x   w     normal-¯  w       i  x       \begin{pmatrix}ix&w\\
 \overline{w}&-ix\end{pmatrix}     with x real.  The period 2 automorphism σ of G c        σ   (  g  )    =   M   g  ¯    M   -  1      ,        σ  g     M   normal-¯  g    superscript  M    1       \displaystyle{\sigma(g)=M\overline{g}M^{-1},}     with       M  =   (     0    1      1    0     )    ,      M    0  1    1  0      M=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\
 1&0\end{pmatrix},     has fixed point subgroup G since        σ   (     a    b      c    d     )    =   (      d  ¯      c  ¯        b  ¯      a  ¯      )    .        σ    a  b    c  d        normal-¯  d    normal-¯  c      normal-¯  b    normal-¯  a       \sigma\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 c&d\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\overline{d}&\overline{c}\\
 \overline{b}&\overline{a}\end{pmatrix}.     Similarly the same formula defines a period two automorphism σ of the Lie algebra    𝔤  c     subscript  𝔤  c    \mathfrak{g}_{c}   of G c , the complex matrices with trace zero. A standard basis of    𝔤  c     subscript  𝔤  c    \mathfrak{g}_{c}   over C is given by         L  0   =   (       1  2      0      0     -    1  2        )    ,     L   -  1    =   (     0    1      0    0     )    ,    L  1   =   (     0    0       -  1     0     )      .     formulae-sequence     subscript  L  0       1  2   0    0      1  2        formulae-sequence     subscript  L    1      0  1    0  0        subscript  L  1     0  0      1   0        L_{0}=\begin{pmatrix}{1\over 2}&0\\
 0&-{1\over 2}\end{pmatrix},\quad L_{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\
 0&0\end{pmatrix},\quad L_{1}=\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\
 -1&0\end{pmatrix}.     Thus for −1 ≤ m , n ≤ 1        [   L  m   ,   L  n   ]   =    (   m  -  n   )    L   m  +  n      .        subscript  L  m    subscript  L  n        m  n    subscript  L    m  n       \displaystyle{[L_{m},L_{n}]=(m-n)L_{m+n}.}     There is a direct sum decomposition        𝔤  c   =   𝔤  ⊕   i  𝔤     ,       subscript  𝔤  c    direct-sum  𝔤    i  𝔤      \mathfrak{g}_{c}=\mathfrak{g}\oplus i\mathfrak{g},     where   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is the +1 eigenspace of σ and    i  𝔤      i  𝔤    i\mathfrak{g}   the –1 eigenspace.  The matrices X in    i  𝔤      i  𝔤    i\mathfrak{g}   have the form       X  =   (     x    w       -   w  ¯       -  x      )    .      X    x  w       normal-¯  w      x       X=\begin{pmatrix}x&w\\
 -\overline{w}&-x\end{pmatrix}.     Note that        -   det  X    =    x  2   -    |  w  |   2     .          X       superscript  x  2    superscript    w   2      -\det X=x^{2}-|w|^{2}.     The cone C in    i  𝔤      i  𝔤    i\mathfrak{g}   is defined by two conditions. The first is that       det  X   <  0.        X   0.    \det X<0.     By definition this condition is preserved under conjugation by G . Since G is connected it leaves the two components with x > 0 and x x  The group G c acts by Möbius transformations on the extended complex plane. The subgroup G acts as automorphisms of the unit disk D . A semigroup H of G c , first considered by , can be defined by the geometric condition:        g   (   D  ¯   )    ⊂  D   .        g   normal-¯  D    D    g(\overline{D})\subset D.     The semigroup can be described explicitly in terms of the cone C : 2       H  =   G  ⋅   exp   (  C  )     =    exp   (  C  )    ⋅  G    .        H   normal-⋅  G    C          normal-⋅    C   G      H=G\cdot\exp(C)=\exp(C)\cdot G.     In fact the matrix X can be conjugated by an element of G to the matrix      Y  =   (      -  y     0      0    y     )       Y      y   0    0  y      Y=\begin{pmatrix}-y&0\\
 0&y\end{pmatrix}     with      y  =     x  2   -    |  w  |   2     >  0.        y       superscript  x  2    superscript    w   2          0.     y=\sqrt{x^{2}-|w|^{2}}>0.     Since the Möbius transformation corresponding to exp Y sends z to e −2 y  z , it follows that the right hand side lies in the semigroup. Conversely if g lies in H it carries the closed unit disk onto a smaller closed disk in its interior. Conjugating by an element of G , the smaller disk can be taken to have centre 0. But then for appropriate y , the element       e   -  Y    g       superscript  e    Y    g    e^{-Y}g     carries D onto itself so lies in G .  A similar argument shows that the closure of H , also a semigroup, is given by        H  ¯   =   {   g  ∈   S  L   (  2  ,  𝐂  )     :    g  D   ⊆  D   }   =   G  ⋅   exp   C  ¯     =   exp    C  ¯   ⋅  G     .         normal-¯  H    conditional-set    g    S  L   2  𝐂         g  D   D          normal-⋅  G     normal-¯  C             normal-⋅   normal-¯  C   G       \overline{H}=\left\{g\in SL(2,{\mathbf{C}})\ :\ gD\subseteq D\right\}=G\cdot%
 \exp{\overline{C}}=\exp{\overline{C}}\cdot G.     From the above statement on conjugacy, it follows that       H  =   G   A  +   G    ,      H    G   subscript  A    G     H=GA_{+}G,     where        A  +   =   {    (      e   -  y      0      0     e  y      )    :   y  >  0   }    .       subscript  A     conditional-set     superscript  e    y    0    0   superscript  e  y       y  0      A_{+}=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}e^{-y}&0\\
 0&e^{y}\end{pmatrix}\ :\ y>0\right\}.     If a matrix      (     a    b      c    d     )      a  b    c  d     \displaystyle{\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 c&d\end{pmatrix}}     is in H then so too are the matrices        (      a  ¯      b  ¯        c  ¯      d  ¯      )   ,   (     a     -  c        -  b     d     )    ,        normal-¯  a    normal-¯  b      normal-¯  c    normal-¯  d       a    c       b   d      \begin{pmatrix}\overline{a}&\overline{b}\\
 \overline{c}&\overline{d}\end{pmatrix},\quad\begin{pmatrix}a&-c\\
 -b&d\end{pmatrix},     since the latter is obtained by taking the transpose and conjugating by the diagonal matrix with entries ±1.  Hence H also contains the matrix       (      a  ¯      -   c  ¯         -   b  ¯       d  ¯      )   .       normal-¯  a      normal-¯  c         normal-¯  b     normal-¯  d      \displaystyle{\begin{pmatrix}\overline{a}&-\overline{c}\\
 -\overline{b}&\overline{d}\end{pmatrix}.}     which gives the inverse matrix if the original matrix lies in SU(1,1).  A further result on conjugacy follows by noting that every element of H must fix a point in D , which by conjugating by an element of G can be taken to be 0. Then the element of H has the form      M  =   (     a    0      b     a   -  1       )       M    a  0    b   superscript  a    1        M=\begin{pmatrix}a&0\\
 b&a^{-1}\end{pmatrix}     with       |  a  |   <  1        a   1    \displaystyle{|a|<1}     and        |  b  |   <     |  a  |    -  1    -   |  a  |     .        b      superscript    a     1      a      \displaystyle{|b|<|a|^{-1}-|a|.}     The set of such lower triangular matrices forms a subsemigroup H 0 of H .  Since        M   (     x    0      0     x   -  1       )    =    (     x    0       b   a   -  1     (   x  -   x   -  1     )       x   -  1       )   M    ,        M    x  0    0   superscript  x    1           x  0      b   superscript  a    1      x   superscript  x    1       superscript  x    1      M     \displaystyle{M\begin{pmatrix}x&0\\
 0&x^{-1}\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}x&0\\
 ba^{-1}(x-x^{-1})&x^{-1}\end{pmatrix}M,}     every matrix in H 0 is conjugate to a diagonal matrix by a matrix M in H 0 .  Similarly every one-parameter semigroup S ( t ) in H fixes the same point in D so is conjugate by an element of G to a one-parameter semigroup in H 0 .  It follows that there is a matrix M in H 0 such that        M  S   (  t  )    =    S  0    (  t  )   M    ,        M  S  t      subscript  S  0   t  M     \displaystyle{MS(t)=S_{0}(t)M,}     with S 0 ( t ) diagonal. Similarly there is a matrix N in H 0 such that        S   (  t  )   N   =   N   S  0    (  t  )     ,        S  t  N     N   subscript  S  0   t     \displaystyle{S(t)N=NS_{0}(t),}     The semigroup H 0 generates the subgroup L of complex lower triangular matrices with determinant 1 (given by the above formula with a ≠ 0). Its Lie algebra consists of matrices of the form       Z  =   (     z    0      w     -  z      )    .      Z    z  0    w    z       Z=\begin{pmatrix}z&0\\
 w&-z\end{pmatrix}.     In particular the one parameter semigroup exp tZ lies in H 0 for all t > 0 if and only if       ℜ  z   <  0        z   0    \Re z<0     and        |   ℜ  z   |   >    1  2    |  w  |     .          z        1  2     w      |\Re z|>{1\over 2}|w|.     This follows from the criterion for H or directly from the formula         exp  Z   =   (      e  z     0       f   (  z  )   w      e   -  z       )    ,    f   (  z  )    =    sinh  z   z     .     formulae-sequence      Z      superscript  e  z   0      f  z  w    superscript  e    z           f  z       z   z      \displaystyle{\exp Z=\begin{pmatrix}e^{z}&0\\
 f(z)w&e^{-z}\end{pmatrix},\qquad f(z)={\sinh z\over z}.}     The exponential map is known not to be surjective in this case, even though it is surjective on the whole group L . This follows because the squaring operation is not surjective in H . Indeed since the square of an element fixes 0 only if the original element fixes 0, it suffices to prove this in H 0 . Take α with |α| \displaystyle{|\alpha +\alpha^{-1}|  If a = α 2 and       b  =    (   1  -  δ   )    (     |  a  |    -  1    -   |  a  |    )     ,      b      1  δ      superscript    a     1      a       \displaystyle{b=(1-\delta)(|a|^{-1}-|a|),}     with         (   1  -  δ   )   2   =    |   α  +   α   -  1     |     |  α  |   +   |   α   -  1    |      ,       superscript    1  δ   2         α   superscript  α    1          α      superscript  α    1         \displaystyle{(1-\delta)^{2}={|\alpha+\alpha^{-1}|\over|\alpha|+|\alpha^{-1}|}},     then the matrix      (     a    0      b     a   -  1       )      a  0    b   superscript  a    1       \begin{pmatrix}a&0\\
 b&a^{-1}\end{pmatrix}     has no square root in H 0 . For a square root would have the form       (     α    0      β     α   -  1       )   .      α  0    β   superscript  α    1       \begin{pmatrix}\alpha&0\\
 \beta&\alpha^{-1}\end{pmatrix}.     On the other hand        |  β  |   =   b   |   α  +   α   -  1     |    =      |  α  |    -  1    -   |  α  |     1  -  δ    >     |  α  |    -  1    -   |  α  |     .          β     b      α   superscript  α    1                 superscript    α     1      α      1  δ            superscript    α     1      α       \displaystyle{|\beta|={b\over|\alpha+\alpha^{-1}|}={|\alpha|^{-1}-|\alpha|%
 \over 1-\delta}>|\alpha|^{-1}-|\alpha|.}     The closed semigroup    H  ¯     normal-¯  H    \overline{H}   is maximal in SL(2, C ): any larger semigroup must be the whole of SL(2, C ). 3 4 5  In fact if S is a semigroup properly containing    H  ¯     normal-¯  H    \overline{H}   and g is in S but not    H  ¯     normal-¯  H    \overline{H}   then either:   The image of the unit circle under g cuts the unit circle twice.  The image of the unit disk under g is disjoint from the unit disk. In this case either the image of the unit circle touches the unit circle or is disjoint. Applying a scaling transformation in H reduces to case (1).   In case (1) if the circles cut at right angles, pre- and post-multiplying g by elements of SU(1,1) the image of the unit circle can be taken to be the real axis with the points ±1 fixed. But then g is the Cayley transform and its square k is the Möbius transformation z −1 . Since k  H  k = H −1 , S contains a neighbourhood of the identity and hence is the whole of SL(2, C ). If the circles do not intersect at right angles, pre- and post-multiplying g by elements of SU(1,1) the points of intersection may be moved close together with 0 in the crescent formed by the obtuse angles and outside the second circle. Scaling transformations in H will transform the second circle into a touching interior circle. In between the angle will have been a right angle, for which the previous argument applies.  gives another way to prove maximality by first showing that there is a g in S sending D onto the disk D c , | z | > 1. In fact if x is in S but not in    H  ¯     normal-¯  H    \overline{H}   , then there is a small disk D 1 in D such that x  D 1 lies in D c . Then for some h in H , D 1 = hD . Similarly yxD 1 = D c for some y in H . So g = yxh lies in S and sends D onto D c . It follows that g 2 fixes the unit disc D so lies in SU(1,1). So g −1 lies in S . If t lies in H then t  g  D contains g  D . Hence g −1 t −1  g lies in    H  ¯     normal-¯  H    \overline{H}   . So t −1 lies in S and therefore S contains an open neighbourhood of 1 . Hence S = SL(2, C ).  Exactly the same argument works for Möbius transformations on R n and the open semigroup taking the closed unit sphere || x || ≤ 1 into the open unit sphere || x || See:       The semigroup H and its closure have a further piece of structure inherited from G , namely inversion on G extends to an antiautomorphism of H and its closure, which fixes the elements in exp C and its closure. For       g  =   (     a    b      c    d     )    ,      g    a  b    c  d      \displaystyle{g=\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 c&d\end{pmatrix},}     the antiautomorphism is given by       g  +   =   (      a  ¯      -   c  ¯         -   b  ¯       d  ¯      )        superscript  g       normal-¯  a      normal-¯  c         normal-¯  b     normal-¯  d       \displaystyle{g^{+}=\begin{pmatrix}\overline{a}&-\overline{c}\\
 -\overline{b}&\overline{d}\end{pmatrix}}     and extends to an antiautomorphism of SL(2, C ).  Similarly the antiautomorphism       g  †   =   (      d  ¯      -   b  ¯         -   c  ¯       a  ¯      )        superscript  g  normal-†      normal-¯  d      normal-¯  b         normal-¯  c     normal-¯  a       \displaystyle{g^{\dagger}=\begin{pmatrix}\overline{d}&-\overline{b}\\
 -\overline{c}&\overline{a}\end{pmatrix}}     leaves G 1 invariant and fixes the elements in exp C 1 and its closure, so it has analogous properties for the semigroup in G 1 .  Commutation relations of Heisenberg and Weyl  Let   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   be the space of Schwartz functions on R . It is dense in the Hilbert space  L 2 ( R ) of square-integrable functions on R . Following the terminology of quantum mechanics , the "momentum" operator P and "position" operator Q are defined on   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   by         P  f   (  x  )    =   i   f  ′    (  x  )     ,    Q  f   (  x  )    =   x  f   (  x  )      .     formulae-sequence      P  f  x     i   superscript  f  normal-′   x        Q  f  x     x  f  x      \displaystyle{Pf(x)=if^{\prime}(x),\qquad Qf(x)=xf(x).}     There operators satisfy the Heisenberg commutation relation         P  Q   -   Q  P    =   i  I    .

Two one parameter unitary groups U ( s ) and V ( t ) can be defined on   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   and L 2 ( R ) by         U   (  s  )   f   (  x  )    =   f   (   x  -  s   )     ,    V   (  t  )   f   (  x  )    =    e   i  x  t    f   (  x  )      .     formulae-sequence      U  s  f  x     f    x  s         V  t  f  x      superscript  e    i  x  t    f  x      \displaystyle{U(s)f(x)=f(x-s),\qquad V(t)f(x)=e^{ixt}f(x).}     By definition         d   d  s    U   (  s  )   f   =   i  P  U   (  s  )   f    ,     d   d  t    V   (  t  )   f   =   i  Q  V   (  t  )   f       formulae-sequence        d    d  s    U  s  f     i  P  U  s  f          d    d  t    V  t  f     i  Q  V  t  f      \displaystyle{{d\over ds}U(s)f=iPU(s)f,\qquad{d\over dt}V(t)f=iQV(t)f}     for f in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   , so that formally         U   (  s  )    =   e   i  P  s     ,    V   (  t  )    =   e   i  Q  t      .     formulae-sequence      U  s    superscript  e    i  P  s         V  t    superscript  e    i  Q  t       \displaystyle{U(s)=e^{iPs},\qquad V(t)=e^{iQt}.}     It is immediate from the definition that the one parameter groups U and V satisfy the Weyl commutation relation        U   (  s  )   V   (  t  )    =    e   -   i  s  t     V   (  t  )   U   (  s  )     .        U  s  V  t      superscript  e      i  s  t     V  t  U  s     \displaystyle{U(s)V(t)=e^{-ist}V(t)U(s).}     The realization of U and V on L 2 ( R ) is called the Schrödinger representation .  Fourier transform  The Fourier transform is defined on   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   by 6         f  ^    (  ξ  )    =    1    2  π       ∫   -  ∞   ∞    f   (  x  )     e   -   i  x  ξ      d  x      .         normal-^  f   ξ       1      2  π       superscript   subscript            f  x   superscript  e      i  x  ξ     d  x       \displaystyle{\widehat{f}(\xi)={1\over\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)e%
 ^{-ix\xi}\,dx.}     It defines a continuous map of   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   into itself for its natural topology.  Contour integration shows that the function        H  0    (  x  )    =    e   -    x  2   /  2       2  π            subscript  H  0   x      superscript  e       superscript  x  2   2         2  π       \displaystyle{H_{0}(x)={e^{-x^{2}/2}\over\sqrt{2\pi}}}     is its own Fourier transform.  On the other hand, integrating by parts or differentiating under the integral,          P  f   ^   =   -   Q   f  ^      ,     Q  f   ^   =   P   f  ^      .     formulae-sequence     normal-^    P  f        Q   normal-^  f         normal-^    Q  f      P   normal-^  f       \widehat{Pf}=-Q\widehat{f},\qquad\widehat{Qf}=P\widehat{f}.     It follows that the operator on   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   defined by       T  f   (  x  )    =     f  ^   ^    (   -  x   )          T  f  x      normal-^   normal-^  f      x      \displaystyle{Tf(x)=\widehat{\widehat{f}}(-x)}     commutes with both Q (and P ). On the other hand       T   H  0    =   H  0         T   subscript  H  0     subscript  H  0     \displaystyle{TH_{0}=H_{0}}     and since       g   (  x  )    =     f   (  x  )    -     f   (  a  )    H  0    (  x  )    /   H  0     (  a  )      x  -  a          g  x         f  x         f  a   subscript  H  0   x    subscript  H  0    a      x  a      \displaystyle{g(x)={f(x)-f(a)H_{0}(x)/H_{0}(a)\over x-a}}     lies in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   , it follows that         T   (   x  -  a   )   g   |    x  =  a    =      (   x  -  a   )   T  g   |    x  =  a    =  0         evaluated-at    T    x  a   g     x  a     evaluated-at      x  a   T  g     x  a         0     \displaystyle{T(x-a)g|_{x=a}=(x-a)Tg|_{x=a}=0}     and hence        T  f   (  a  )    =   f   (  a  )     .        T  f  a     f  a     \displaystyle{Tf(a)=f(a).}     This implies the Fourier inversion formula :       f   (  x  )    =    1    2  π       ∫   -  ∞   ∞     f  ^    (  ξ  )     e   i  x  ξ     d  ξ           f  x       1      2  π       superscript   subscript             normal-^  f   ξ   superscript  e    i  x  ξ    d  ξ       \displaystyle{f(x)={1\over\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\widehat{f}(\xi)e%
 ^{ix\xi}\,d\xi}     and shows that the Fourier transform is an isomorphism of   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   onto itself.  By Fubini's theorem         ∫   -  ∞   ∞    f   (  x  )    g  ^    (  x  )   d  x    =    1    2  π      ∬   f   (  x  )   g   (  ξ  )     e   -   i  x  ξ      d  x  d  ξ     =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞     f  ^    (  ξ  )   g   (  ξ  )   d  ξ     .          superscript   subscript            f  x   normal-^  g   x  d  x        1      2  π      double-integral    f  x  g  ξ   superscript  e      i  x  ξ     d  x  d  ξ            superscript   subscript             normal-^  f   ξ  g  ξ  d  ξ       \displaystyle{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)\widehat{g}(x)\,dx={1\over\sqrt{2\pi}%
 }\iint f(x)g(\xi)e^{-ix\xi}\,dxd\xi=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\widehat{f}(\xi)g(%
 \xi)\,d\xi.}     When combined with the inversion formula this implies that the Fourier transform preserves the inner product       (   f  ^   ,   g  ^   )   =   (  f  ,  g  )         normal-^  f    normal-^  g     f  g     \displaystyle{(\widehat{f},\widehat{g})=(f,g)}     so defines an isometry of   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   onto itself.  By density it extends to a unitary operator on L 2 ( R ), as asserted by Plancherel's theorem .  Stone–von Neumann theorem  Now suppose that U ( s ) and V ( t ) are one parameter unitary groups on a Hilbert space   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   satisfying the Weyl commutation relations        U   (  s  )   V   (  t  )    =    e   -   i  s  t     V   (  t  )   U   (  s  )     .

 F(y,x)}.}     The operators T ( F ) have an important non-degeneracy property : the linear span of all vectors T ( F )ξ is dense in   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   .  Indeed if f  ds and g  dt define probability measures with compact support, then the smeared operators        U   (  f  )    =   ∫   U   (  s  )   f   (  s  )   d  s     ,    V   (  g  )    =   ∫   V   (  t  )   g   (  t  )   d  t        formulae-sequence      U  f       U  s  f  s  d  s         V  g       V  t  g  t  d  t       \displaystyle{U(f)=\int U(s)f(s)\,ds,\qquad V(g)=\int V(t)g(t)\,dt}     satisfy        ∥   U   (  f  )    ∥   ,   ∥   V   (  g  )    ∥    ≤  1        norm    U  f     norm    V  g     1    \displaystyle{\|U(f)\|,\,\|V(g)\|\leq 1}     and converge in the strong operator topology to the identity operator if the supports of the measures decrease to 0.  Since U ( f )V( g ) has the form T ( F ), non-degeneracy follows.  When   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   is the Schrödinger representation on L 2 ( R ), the operator T ( F ) is given by        T   (  F  )   f   (  x  )    =   ∫   F   (  x  ,  y  )   f   (  y  )   d  y     .        T  F  f  x       F   x  y   f  y  d  y      T(F)f(x)=\int F(x,y)f(y)\,dy.     It follows from this formula that U and V jointly act irreducibly on the Schrödinger representation since this is true for the operators given by kernels that are Schwartz functions.  Conversely given a representation of the Weyl communtation relations on   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   , it gives rise to a non-degenerate representation of the *-algebra of kernel operators. But all such representations are on an orthogonal direct sum of copies of L 2 ( R ) with the action on each copy as above. This is a straightforward generalisation of the elementary fact that the representations of the N × N matrices are on direct sums of the standard representation on C N . The proof using matrix units works equally well in infinite dimensions.  The one parameter unitary groups U and V leave each component invariant, inducing the standard action on the Schrödinger representation.  In particular this implies the Stone–von Neumann theorem : the Schrödinger representation is the unique irreducible representation of the Weyl commutation relations on a Hilbert space.  Oscillator representation of SL(2,R)  Given U and V satisfying the Weyl commutation relations, define        W   (  x  ,  y  )    =    e    i  x  y   /  2    U   (  x  )   V   (  y  )     .        W   x  y       superscript  e      i  x  y   2    U  x  V  y     \displaystyle{W(x,y)=e^{ixy/2}U(x)V(y).}     Then        W   (   x  1   ,   y  1   )   W   (   x  2   ,   y  2   )    =    e   i   (     x  1    y  2    -    y  1    x  2     )     W   (    x  1   +   x  2    ,    y  1   +   y  2    )     ,        W    subscript  x  1    subscript  y  1    W    subscript  x  2    subscript  y  2        superscript  e    i       subscript  x  1    subscript  y  2       subscript  y  1    subscript  x  2       W      subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2       subscript  y  1    subscript  y  2        \displaystyle{W(x_{1},y_{1})W(x_{2},y_{2})=e^{i(x_{1}y_{2}-y_{1}x_{2})}W(x_{1}%
 +x_{2},y_{1}+y_{2}),}     so that W defines a projective unitary representation of R 2 with cocycle given by        ω   (   z  1   ,   z  2   )    =   e   i  B   (   z  1   ,   z  2   )      ,        ω    subscript  z  1    subscript  z  2      superscript  e    i  B    subscript  z  1    subscript  z  2        \displaystyle{\omega(z_{1},z_{2})=e^{iB(z_{1},z_{2})},}     where       z  =   x  +   i  y    =   (  x  ,  y  )    ,        z    x    i  y          x  y      \displaystyle{z=x+iy=(x,y),}     and B is the symplectic form on R 2 given by        B   (   z  1   ,   z  2   )    =     x  1    y  2    -    y  1    x  2     =    ℑ     z  1     z  2   ¯      .          B    subscript  z  1    subscript  z  2          subscript  x  1    subscript  y  2       subscript  y  1    subscript  x  2               subscript  z  1    normal-¯   subscript  z  2         \displaystyle{B(z_{1},z_{2})=x_{1}y_{2}-y_{1}x_{2}=\Im\,z_{1}\overline{z_{2}}.}     By the Stone–von Neumann theorem, there is a unique irreducible representation corresponding to this cocycle.  It follows that if g is an automorphism of R 2 preserving the form B , i.e. an element of SL(2, R ), then there is a unitary π( g ) on L 2 ( R ) satisfying the covariance relation        π   (  g  )   W   (  z  )   π    (  g  )   *    =   W   (   g   (  z  )    )     .        π  g  W  z  π   superscript  g       W    g  z      \displaystyle{\pi(g)W(z)\pi(g)^{*}=W(g(z)).}     By Schur's lemma the unitary π( g ) is unique up to multiplication by a scalar ζ with |ζ| = 1, so that π defines a projective unitary representation of SL(2, R ).  This can be established directly using only the irreducibility of the Schrödinger representation. Irreducibility was a direct consequence of the fact the operators       ∬   K   (  x  ,  y  )   U   (  x  )   V   (  y  )   d  x  d  y    ,     double-integral    K   x  y   U  x  V  y  d  x  d  y     \displaystyle{\iint K(x,y)U(x)V(y)\,dxdy,}     with K a Schwartz function correspond exactly to operators given by kernels with Schwartz functions.  These are dense in the space of Hilbert–Schmidt operators , which, since it contains the finite rank operators, acts irreducibly.  The existence of π can be proved using only the irreducibility of the Schrödinger representation. The operators are unique up to a sign with        π   (   g  h   )    =   ±   π   (  g  )   π   (  h  )      ,        π    g  h     plus-or-minus    π  g  π  h      \displaystyle{\pi(gh)=\pm\pi(g)\pi(h),}     so that the 2-cocycle for the projective representation of SL(2, R ) takes values ±1.  In fact the group SL(2, R ) is generated by matrices of the form         g  1   =   (     a    0      0     a   -  1       )    ,     g  2   =   (     1    0      b    1     )    ,    g  3   =   (     0    1       -  1     0     )      ,     formulae-sequence     subscript  g  1     a  0    0   superscript  a    1        formulae-sequence     subscript  g  2     1  0    b  1        subscript  g  3     0  1      1   0        \displaystyle{g_{1}=\begin{pmatrix}a&0\\

The generators g i satisfy the following Bruhat relations , which uniquely specify the group SL(2, R ): 9         g  3  2   =    g  1    (   -  1   )     ,      g  3    g  1    (  a  )    g  3   -  1     =    g  1    (   a   -  1    )     ,      g  1    (  a  )    g  2    (  b  )    g  1     (  a  )    -  1     =    g  2    (    a   -  2    b   )     ,     g  1    (  a  )    =    g  3    g  2    (   a   -  1    )    g  3    g  2    (  a  )    g  3    g  2    (   a   -  1    )        .     formulae-sequence     superscript   subscript  g  3   2      subscript  g  1     1      formulae-sequence       subscript  g  3    subscript  g  1   a   superscript   subscript  g  3     1        subscript  g  1    superscript  a    1       formulae-sequence       subscript  g  1   a   subscript  g  2   b   subscript  g  1    superscript  a    1        subscript  g  2      superscript  a    2    b          subscript  g  1   a      subscript  g  3    subscript  g  2    superscript  a    1     subscript  g  3    subscript  g  2   a   subscript  g  3    subscript  g  2    superscript  a    1          \displaystyle{g_{3}^{2}=g_{1}(-1),\,\,g_{3}g_{1}(a)g_{3}^{-1}=g_{1}(a^{-1}),\,%

There is a more conceptual explanation using an explicit construction of the metaplectic group as a double cover of SL(2, R ). 10  In fact SL(2, R ) acts by Möbius transformations on the upper half plane  H .  Moreover if       g  =   (     a    b      c    d     )    ,      g    a  b    c  d      \displaystyle{g=\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 c&d\end{pmatrix},}     then         d  g   (  z  )     d  z    =   1    (    c  z   +  d   )   2     .          d  g  z     d  z      1   superscript      c  z   d   2      \displaystyle{{dg(z)\over dz}={1\over(cz+d)^{2}}.}     The function       m   (  g  ,  z  )    =    c  z   +  d         m   g  z        c  z   d     \displaystyle{m(g,z)=cz+d}     satisfies the 1-cocycle relation        m   (   g  h   ,  z  )    =   m   (  g  ,   h  z   )   m   (  h  ,  z  )     .        m     g  h   z      m   g    h  z    m   h  z      \displaystyle{m(gh,z)=m(g,hz)m(h,z).}     For each g , the function m ( g , z ) is non-vanishing on H and therefore has two possible holomorphic square roots.  The metaplectic group is defined as the group        M  p   (  2  ,  𝐑  )    =   {   (  g  ,  G  )   :    G    (  z  )   2    =   m   (  g  ,  z  )     }    .        M  p   2  𝐑     conditional-set   g  G       G   superscript  z  2      m   g  z        \displaystyle{Mp(2,\mathbf{R})=\{(g,G):\,G(z)^{2}=m(g,z)\}.}     By definition it is a double cover of SL(2, R ) and is connected.  Multiplication is given by         (  g  ,  G  )   ⋅   (  h  ,  H  )    =   (   g  h   ,  K  )    ,       normal-⋅   g  G    h  H       g  h   K     \displaystyle{(g,G)\cdot(h,H)=(gh,K),}     where        K   (  z  )    =   G   (   h  z   )   H   (  z  )     .        K  z     G    h  z   H  z     \displaystyle{K(z)=G(hz)H(z).}     Thus for an element g of the metaplectic group there is a uniquely determined function m ( g , z ) 1/2 satisfying the 1-cocycle relation.  If     ℑ  z   >  0        z   0    \Im z>0   , then        f  z    (  x  )    =   e    i  z   x  2    /  2           subscript  f  z   x    superscript  e      i  z   superscript  x  2    2      \displaystyle{f_{z}(x)=e^{izx^{2}/2}}     lies in L 2 and is called a coherent state .  These functions lie in a single orbit of SL(2, R ) generated by         f  i    (  x  )    =   e   -    x  2   /  2      ,         subscript  f  i   x    superscript  e       superscript  x  2   2       \displaystyle{f_{i}(x)=e^{-x^{2}/2},}     since for g in SL(2, R )        π   (    (   g  t   )    -  1    )    f  z    (  x  )    =   ±   m    (  g  ,  z  )    -   1  /  2      f   g  z     (  x  )      .        π   superscript   superscript  g  t     1     subscript  f  z   x    plus-or-minus    m   superscript   g  z       1  2      subscript  f    g  z    x      \displaystyle{\pi((g^{t})^{-1})f_{z}(x)=\pm m(g,z)^{-1/2}f_{gz}(x).}     More specifically if g lies in Mp(2, R ) then        π   (    (   g  t   )    -  1    )    f  z    (  x  )    =   m    (  g  ,  z  )    -   1  /  2      f   g  z     (  x  )     .        π   superscript   superscript  g  t     1     subscript  f  z   x     m   superscript   g  z       1  2      subscript  f    g  z    x     \displaystyle{\pi((g^{t})^{-1})f_{z}(x)=m(g,z)^{-1/2}f_{gz}(x).}     Indeed if this holds for g and h , it also holds for their product. On the other hand the formula is easily checked if g t has the form g i and these are generators.  This defines an ordinary unitary representation of the metaplectic group.  The element (1,–1) acts as multiplication by –1 on L 2 ( R ), from which it follows that the cocycle on SL(2, R ) takes only values ±1.  Maslov index  As explained in , the 2-cocycle on SL(2, R ) associated with the metaplectic representation, taking values ±1, is determined by the Maslov index .  Given three non-zero vectors u , v , w in the plane, their Maslov index     τ   (  u  ,  v  ,  w  )       τ   u  v  w     \tau(u,v,w)   is defined as the signature of the quadratic form on R 3 defined by        Q   (  a  ,  b  ,  c  )    =    a  b  B   (  u  ,  v  )    +   b  c  B   (  v  ,  w  )    +   c  a  B   (  w  ,  u  )      .        Q   a  b  c        a  b  B   u  v      b  c  B   v  w      c  a  B   w  u       \displaystyle{Q(a,b,c)=abB(u,v)+bcB(v,w)+caB(w,u).}     Properties of the Maslov index :   it depends on the one-dimensional subpaces spanned by the vectors  it is invariant under SL(2, R )  it is alternating in its arguments, i.e. its sign changes if two of the arguments are interchanged  it vanishes if two of the subspaces coincide  it takes the values –1, 0 and +1: if u and v satisfy B ( u , v ) = 1 and w = au + bv , then the Maslov index is zero is if ab = 0 and is otherwise equal to minus the sign of ab          τ   (  v  ,  w  ,  z  )    -   τ   (  u  ,  w  ,  z  )     +   τ   (  u  ,  v  ,  z  )     -   τ   (  u  ,  v  ,  w  )     =  0              τ   v  w  z      τ   u  w  z       τ   u  v  z       τ   u  v  w     0    \displaystyle{\tau(v,w,z)-\tau(u,w,z)+\tau(u,v,z)-\tau(u,v,w)=0}      Picking a non-zero vector u 0 , it follows that the function       Ω   (  g  ,  h  )    =   exp  -     π  i   4   τ   (   u  0   ,   g   u  0    ,   g  h   u  0    )           normal-Ω   g  h             π  i   4   τ    subscript  u  0     g   subscript  u  0      g  h   subscript  u  0         \displaystyle{\Omega(g,h)=\exp-{\pi i\over 4}\tau(u_{0},gu_{0},ghu_{0})}     defines a 2-cocycle on SL(2, R ) with values in the eighth roots of unity.  A modification of the 2-cocycle can be used to define a 2-cocycle with values in ±1 connected with the metaplectic cocycle. 11  In fact given non-zero vectors u , v in the plane, define f ( u , v ) to be   i times the sign of B ( u , v ) if u and v are not proportional  the sign of λ if u = λ v .   If        b   (  g  )    =   f   (   u  0   ,   g   u  0    )     ,        b  g     f    subscript  u  0     g   subscript  u  0        \displaystyle{b(g)=f(u_{0},gu_{0}),}     then        Ω    (  g  ,  h  )   2    =   b   (   g  h   )   b    (  g  )    -  1    b    (  h  )    -  1      .        normal-Ω   superscript   g  h   2      b    g  h   b   superscript  g    1    b   superscript  h    1       \displaystyle{\Omega(g,h)^{2}=b(gh)b(g)^{-1}b(h)^{-1}.}     The representatives π( g ) in the metaplectic representation can be chosen so that       π   (   g  h   )    =   ω   (  g  ,  h  )   π   (  g  )   π   (  h  )          π    g  h      ω   g  h   π  g  π  h     \displaystyle{\pi(gh)=\omega(g,h)\pi(g)\pi(h)}     where the 2-cocycle ω is given by        ω   (  g  ,  h  )    =   Ω   (  g  ,  h  )   β    (   g  h   )    -  1    β   (  g  )   β   (  h  )     ,        ω   g  h      normal-Ω   g  h   β   superscript    g  h     1    β  g  β  h     \displaystyle{\omega(g,h)=\Omega(g,h)\beta(gh)^{-1}\beta(g)\beta(h),}     with        β    (  g  )   2    =   b   (  g  )     .        β   superscript  g  2      b  g     \displaystyle{\beta(g)^{2}=b(g).}     Holomorphic Fock space  Holomorphic Fock space (also known as the Segal–Bargmann space ) is defined to be the vector space   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   of holomorphic functions f ( z ) on C with       1  π     ∬  ℂ      |   f   (  z  )    |   2     e   -    |  z  |   2      d  x  d  y          1  π     subscript  double-integral  ℂ      superscript      f  z    2    superscript  e     superscript    z   2     d  x  d  y      \displaystyle{{1\over\pi}\iint_{\mathbb{C}}|f(z)|^{2}e^{-|z|^{2}}\,dxdy}     finite. It has inner product        (   f  1   ,   f  2   )   =    1  π     ∬  ℂ     f  1    (  z  )      f  2    (  z  )    ¯     e   -    |  z  |   2      d  x  d  y      .        subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2        1  π     subscript  double-integral  ℂ      subscript  f  1   z   normal-¯     subscript  f  2   z     superscript  e     superscript    z   2     d  x  d  y       \displaystyle{(f_{1},f_{2})={1\over\pi}\iint_{\mathbb{C}}f_{1}(z)\overline{f_{%

Moreover the power series expansion of a holomorphic function in   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   gives its expansion with respect to this basis. 12  Thus for z in C        |   f   (  z  )    |   =   |    ∑   n  ≥  0      a  n    z  n     |   ≤    ∥  f  ∥    e     |  z  |   2   /  2      ,            f  z        subscript     n  0       subscript  a  n    superscript  z  n              norm  f    superscript  e     superscript    z   2   2        \displaystyle{|f(z)|=\left|\sum_{n\geq 0}a_{n}z^{n}\right|\leq\|f\|e^{|z|^{2}/%
 2},}     so that evaluation at z is gives a continuous linear functional on   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   .  In fact       f   (  a  )    =   (  f  ,   E  a   )         f  a    f   subscript  E  a      \displaystyle{f(a)=(f,E_{a})}     where 13         E  a    (  z  )    =    ∑   n  ≥  0       (   E  a   ,   e  n   )    z  n      n  !      =    ∑   n  ≥  0       z  n     a  ¯   n     n  !     =   e   z   a  ¯      .           subscript  E  a   z     subscript     n  0          subscript  E  a    subscript  e  n     superscript  z  n        n             subscript     n  0         superscript  z  n    superscript   normal-¯  a   n      n           superscript  e    z   normal-¯  a        \displaystyle{E_{a}(z)=\sum_{n\geq 0}{(E_{a},e_{n})z^{n}\over\sqrt{n!}}=\sum_{%
 n\geq 0}{z^{n}\overline{a}^{n}\over n!}=e^{z\overline{a}}.}     Thus in particular   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space .  For f in   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   and z in C define         W  ℱ    (  z  )   f   (  w  )    =    e   -     |  z  |   2   /  2      e   w   z  ¯     f   (   w  -  z   )     .         subscript  W  ℱ   z  f  w      superscript  e       superscript    z   2   2      superscript  e    w   normal-¯  z     f    w  z      \displaystyle{W_{\mathcal{F}}(z)f(w)=e^{-|z|^{2}/2}e^{w\overline{z}}f(w-z).}     Then         W  ℱ    (   z  1   )    W  ℱ    (   z  2   )    =    e   -   i   ℑ    z  1     z  2   ¯         W  ℱ    (    z  1   +   z  2    )     ,         subscript  W  ℱ    subscript  z  1    subscript  W  ℱ    subscript  z  2       superscript  e      i       subscript  z  1    normal-¯   subscript  z  2          subscript  W  ℱ      subscript  z  1    subscript  z  2       \displaystyle{W_{\mathcal{F}}(z_{1})W_{\mathcal{F}}(z_{2})=e^{-i\Im z_{1}%
 \overline{z_{2}}}W_{\mathcal{F}}(z_{1}+z_{2}),}     so this gives a unitary representation of the Weyl commutation relations. 14 Now         W  ℱ    (  a  )    E  0    =    e   -     |  a  |   2   /  2      E  a     .         subscript  W  ℱ   a   subscript  E  0       superscript  e       superscript    a   2   2      subscript  E  a      \displaystyle{W_{\mathcal{F}}(a)E_{0}=e^{-|a|^{2}/2}E_{a}.}     It follows that the representation    W  ℱ     subscript  W  ℱ    W_{\mathcal{F}}   is irreducible.  Indeed any function orthogonal to all the E a must vanish, so that their linear span is dense in   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   .  If P is an orthogonal projection commuting with W ( z ), let f = P  E 0 . Then        f   (  z  )    =   (   P   E  0    ,   E  z   )   =    e    |  z  |   2     (   P   E  0    ,    W  ℱ    (  z  )    E  0    )    =   (   P   E   -  z     ,   E  0   )   =    f   (   -  z   )    ¯    .          f  z      P   subscript  E  0     subscript  E  z            superscript  e   superscript    z   2       P   subscript  E  0       subscript  W  ℱ   z   subscript  E  0              P   subscript  E    z      subscript  E  0          normal-¯    f    z        \displaystyle{f(z)=(PE_{0},E_{z})=e^{|z|^{2}}(PE_{0},W_{\mathcal{F}}(z)E_{0})=%
 (PE_{-z},E_{0})=\overline{f(-z)}.}     The only holomorphic function satisfying this condition is the constant function. So        P   E  0    =   λ   E  0     ,        P   subscript  E  0      λ   subscript  E  0      \displaystyle{PE_{0}=\lambda E_{0}},     with λ = 0 or 1. Since E 0 is cyclic, it follows that P = 0 or I .  By the Stone–von Neumann theorem there is a unitary operator   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   from L 2 ( R ) onto   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   , unique up to multiplication by a scalar, intertwining the two representations of the Weyl commutation relations. By Schur's lemma and the Gelfand–Naimark construction , the matrix coefficient of any vector determines the vector up to a scalar multiple. Since the matrix coefficients of F = E 0 and f = H 0 are equal, it follows that the unitary   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   is uniquely determined by the properties        W  ℱ    (  a  )   𝒰   =   𝒰  W   (  a  )           subscript  W  ℱ   a  𝒰     𝒰  W  a     \displaystyle{W_{\mathcal{F}}(a)\mathcal{U}=\mathcal{U}W(a)}     and        𝒰   H  0    =   E  0    .

The associated Sobolev spaces  H s , sometimes called Hermite-Sobolev spaces , are defined to  be the completions of   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   with respect to the norms         ∥  f  ∥    (  s  )   2   =    ∑   n  ≥  0       |   a  n   |   2     (   1  +   2  n    )   s      ,       superscript   subscript   norm  f   s   2     subscript     n  0       superscript     subscript  a  n    2    superscript    1    2  n    s       \displaystyle{\|f\|_{(s)}^{2}=\sum_{n\geq 0}|a_{n}|^{2}(1+2n)^{s},}     where      f  =   ∑    a  n    H  n         f       subscript  a  n    subscript  H  n       \displaystyle{f=\sum a_{n}H_{n}}     is the expansion of f in Hermite functions. 27  Thus          ∥  f  ∥    (  s  )   2   =   (    D  s   f   ,  f  )    ,     (   f  1   ,   f  2   )    (  s  )    =   (    D  s    f  1    ,   f  2   )     .     formulae-sequence     superscript   subscript   norm  f   s   2       superscript  D  s   f   f       subscript    subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2    s       superscript  D  s    subscript  f  1     subscript  f  2       \displaystyle{\|f\|_{(s)}^{2}=(D^{s}f,f),\,\,\,(f_{1},f_{2})_{(s)}=(D^{s}f_{1}%
 ,f_{2}).}     The spaces are Hilbert spaces.  Moreover H s and H – s are in duality under the pairing        ⟨   f  1   ,   f  2   ⟩   =   ∫    f  1     f  2    d  x     .        subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2         subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2   d  x      \displaystyle{\langle f_{1},f_{2}\rangle=\int f_{1}f_{2}\,dx.}     For s ≥ 0,        ∥    (    a  P   +   b  Q    )   f   ∥    (  s  )    ≤    (    |  a  |   +   |  b  |    )    C  s     ∥  f  ∥    (   s  +   1  2    )          subscript   norm        a  P     b  Q    f    s         a     b     subscript  C  s    subscript   norm  f     s    1  2        \displaystyle{\|(aP+bQ)f\|_{(s)}\leq(|a|+|b|)C_{s}\|f\|_{(s+{1\over 2})}}     for some positive constant C s .  Indeed such an inequality can be checked for creation and annihilation operators acting on Hermite functions H n and this implies the general inequality. 28  It follows for arbitrary s by duality.  Consequently for a quadratic polynomial R in P and Q         ∥   R  f   ∥    (  s  )    ≤    C  s  ′     ∥  f  ∥    (   s  +  1   )      .       subscript   norm    R  f    s      superscript   subscript  C  s   normal-′    subscript   norm  f     s  1       \displaystyle{\|Rf\|_{(s)}\leq C_{s}^{\prime}\|f\|_{(s+1)}.}     The Sobolev inequality holds for f in H s with s > 1/2:       |   f   (  x  )    |   ≤    C   s  ,  k      ∥  f  ∥    (   s  +  k   )      (   1  +   x  2    )    -  k             f  x       subscript  C   s  k     subscript   norm  f     s  k     superscript    1   superscript  x  2      k       \displaystyle{|f(x)|\leq C_{s,k}\|f\|_{(s+k)}(1+x^{2})^{-k}}     for any k ≥ 0.  Indeed the result for general k follows from the case k = 0 applied to Q k f .  For k = 0 the Fourier inversion formula       f   (  x  )    =    1    2  π       ∫   -  ∞   ∞     f  ^    (  t  )     e   i  t  x     d  t           f  x       1      2  π       superscript   subscript             normal-^  f   t   superscript  e    i  t  x    d  t       \displaystyle{f(x)={1\over\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\widehat{f}(t)e^{%

It follows from Sobolev's inequality that the intersection of the spaces H s is   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   . Functions in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   are characterized by the rapid decay of their Hermite coefficients a n .  Standard arguments show that each Sobolev space is invariant under the operators W ( z ) and the metaplectic group. 29  Indeed it is enough to check invariance when g is sufficiently close to the identity.  In that case       g  D   g   -  1     =   D  +  A         g  D   superscript  g    1       D  A     \displaystyle{gDg^{-1}=D+A}     with D + A an isomorphism from H t +2 to H t .  It follows that         ∥   π   (  g  )   f   ∥    (  s  )   2   =   |   (     (   D  +  A   )   s   f   ,  f  )   |   ≤     ∥     (   D  +  A   )   s   f   ∥    (   -  s   )    ⋅    ∥  f  ∥    (  s  )     ≤   C    ∥  f  ∥    (  s  )   2     .         subscript   superscript   norm    π  g  f    2   s         superscript    D  A   s   f   f          normal-⋅   subscript   norm     superscript    D  A   s   f      s     subscript   norm  f   s           C   superscript   subscript   norm  f   s   2       \displaystyle{\|\pi(g)f\|^{2}_{(s)}=|((D+A)^{s}f,f)|\leq\|(D+A)^{s}f\|_{(-s)}%
 \cdot\|f\|_{(s)}\leq C\|f\|_{(s)}^{2}.}     If f is in H s , then          d   d  s    U   (  s  )   f   =   i  P  U   (  s  )   f    ,     d   d  t    V   (  t  )   f   =   i  Q  V   (  t  )   f     ,     formulae-sequence        d    d  s    U  s  f     i  P  U  s  f          d    d  t    V  t  f     i  Q  V  t  f      \displaystyle{{d\over ds}U(s)f=iPU(s)f,\,\,\,{d\over dt}V(t)f=iQV(t)f,}     where the derivatives lie in H s –½ .  Similarly the partial derivatives of total degree k of U(s)V(t)f lie in Sobolev spaces of order s – k /2.  Consequently a monomial in P and Q of order 2k applied to f lies in H s – k and can be expressed as a linear combination of partial derivatives of U(s)V(t)f of degree ≤ 2k evaluated at 0.  Smooth vectors  The smooth vectors for the Weyl commutation relations are those u in L 2 ( R ) such that the map       Φ   (  z  )    =   W   (  z  )   u         normal-Φ  z     W  z  u     \displaystyle{\Phi(z)=W(z)u}     is smooth. By the uniform boundedness theorem , this is equivalent to the requirement that each matrix coefficient (W(z)u,v) be smooth.  A vector is smooth if and only it lies in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   . 30 Sufficiency is clear. For necessity, smoothness implies that the partial derivatives of W(z)u lie in L 2 ( R ) and hence also D k u for all positive k . Hence u lies in the intersection of the H k , so in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   .  It follows that smooth vectors are also smooth for the metaplectic group.  Moreover a vector is in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   if and only if it is a smooth vector for the rotation subgroup of SU(1,1).  Analytic vectors  If Π( t ) is a one parameter unitary group and for f in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}           Π   (  f  )    =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞    f   (  t  )   Π   (  t  )   d  t     ,        normal-Π  f     superscript   subscript            f  t  normal-Π  t  d  t      \displaystyle{\Pi(f)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)\Pi(t)\,dt,}     then the vectors Π( f )ξ form a dense set of smooth vectors for Π.  In fact taking        f  ε    (  x  )    =    1    2  π  ε      e   -     x  2   /  2   ε             subscript  f  ε   x       1      2  π  ε      superscript  e         superscript  x  2   2   ε        \displaystyle{f_{\varepsilon}(x)={1\over\sqrt{2\pi\varepsilon}}e^{-x^{2}/2%
 \varepsilon}}     the vectors v = Π( f ε )ξ converge to ξ as ε decreases to 0 and       Φ   (  t  )    =   Π   (  t  )   v         normal-Φ  t     normal-Π  t  v     \displaystyle{\Phi(t)=\Pi(t)v}     is an analytic function of t that extends to an entire function on C .  The vector is called an entire vector for Π.  The wave operator associated to the harmonic oscillator is defined by        Π   (  t  )    =   e   i  t   D      .        normal-Π  t    superscript  e    i  t    D       \displaystyle{\Pi(t)=e^{it\sqrt{D}}.}     The operator is diagonal with the Hermite functions H n as eigenfunctions:        Π   (  t  )    H  n    =    e   i    (    2  n   +  1   )    1  2    t     H  n     .        normal-Π  t   subscript  H  n       superscript  e    i   superscript      2  n   1     1  2    t     subscript  H  n      \displaystyle{\Pi(t)H_{n}=e^{i(2n+1)^{1\over 2}t}H_{n}.}     Since it commutes with D , it preserves the Sobolev spaces.  The analytic vectors constructed above can be rewritten in terms of the Hermite semigroup as       v  =    e   -   ε  D     ξ    .      v     superscript  e      ε  D     ξ     \displaystyle{v=e^{-\varepsilon D}\xi.}     The fact that v is an entire vector for Π is equivalent to the summability condition        ∑   n  ≥  0       r  n    ∥    D    n  2     v   ∥     n  !     <  ∞        subscript     n  0         superscript  r  n    norm     superscript  D    n  2    v       n        \displaystyle{\sum_{n\geq 0}{r^{n}\|D^{n\over 2}v\|\over n!}<\infty}     for all r > 0.  Any such vector is also an entire vector for U(s)V(t) , that is the map       F   (  s  ,  t  )    =   U   (  s  )   V   (  t  )   v         F   s  t      U  s  V  t  v     \displaystyle{F(s,t)=U(s)V(t)v}     defined on R 2 extends to an analytic map on C 2 .  This reduces to the power series estimate        ∥    ∑    m  ,  n   ≥  0      1    m  !    n  !      z  m    w  n    P  m    Q  n   v    ∥   ≤   C    ∑   k  ≥  0        (    |  z  |   +   |  w  |    )   k    k  !     ∥    D   k  2    v   ∥      <  ∞   .         norm    subscript      m  n   0        1      m     n      superscript  z  m    superscript  w  n    superscript  P  m    superscript  Q  n   v       C    subscript     k  0         superscript      z     w    k     k     norm     superscript  D    k  2    v                \displaystyle{\left\|\sum_{m,n\geq 0}{1\over m!n!}z^{m}w^{n}P^{m}Q^{n}v\right%
 \|\leq C\sum_{k\geq 0}{(|z|+|w|)^{k}\over k!}\|D^{k\over 2}v\|<\infty.}     So these form a dense set of entire vectors for U(s)V(t) ; this can also be checked directly using Mehler's formula.  The spaces of smooth and entire vectors for U(s)V(t) are each by definition invariant under the action of the metaplectic group as well as the Hermite semigroup.  Let       W   (  z  ,  w  )    =    e   -    i  z  w   /  2     U   (  z  )   V   (  w  )          W   z  w       superscript  e        i  z  w   2     U  z  V  w     \displaystyle{W(z,w)=e^{-izw/2}U(z)V(w)}     be the analytic continuation of the operators W ( x , y ) from R 2 to C 2 such that         e   -    i  z  w   /  2     F   (  z  ,  w  )    =   W   (  z  ,  w  )   v    .         superscript  e        i  z  w   2     F   z  w      W   z  w   v     \displaystyle{e^{-izw/2}F(z,w)=W(z,w)v.}     Then W leaves the space of entire vectors invariant and satisfies        W   (   z  1   ,   w  1   )   W   (   z  2   ,   w  2   )    =    e   i   (     z  1    w  2    -    w  1    z  2     )     W   (    z  1   +   z  2    ,    w  1   +   w  2    )     .

Formally        W    (  z  ,  w  )   *    =   W   (   -   z  ¯    ,   -   w  ¯    )     .        W   superscript   z  w        W      normal-¯  z       normal-¯  w        \displaystyle{W(z,w)^{*}=W(-\overline{z},-\overline{w}).}     Oscillator semigroup  There is a natural double cover of the Olshanski semigroup H , and its closure    H  ¯     normal-¯  H    \overline{H}   that extends the double cover of SU(1,1) corresponding to the metaplectic group. It is given by pairs ( g , γ) where g is an element of H or its closure      g  =   (     a    b      c    d     )       g    a  b    c  d      \displaystyle{g=\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 c&d\end{pmatrix}}     and γ is a square root of a .  Such a choice determines a unique branch of       (    -    b  ¯   z    +   d  ¯    )    1  2      superscript         normal-¯  b   z     normal-¯  d      1  2     \displaystyle{\left(-\overline{b}z+\overline{d}\right)^{1\over 2}}     for | z |  \displaystyle{\pi(g) W(u) =W(g\cdot u) \pi(g), \,\,\, \pi(g)^*W(u) =W(g^{-1}\cdot u)\pi(g)^*}  for u in C 2 .  An element g of the complexification SL(2, C ) is said to implementable if there is a bounded operator T such that it and its adjoint leave the space of entire vectors for W invariant, both have dense images and satisfy the covariance relations        T  W   (  u  )    =   W   (   g  ⋅  u   )   T    ,     T  *   W   (  u  )    =   W   (    g  †   ⋅  u   )    T  *        formulae-sequence      T  W  u     W   normal-⋅  g  u   T         superscript  T    W  u     W   normal-⋅   superscript  g  normal-†   u    superscript  T        \displaystyle{TW(u)=W(g\cdot u)T,\,\,\,T^{*}W(u)=W(g^{\dagger}\cdot u)T^{*}}     for u in C 2 . The implementing operator T is uniquely determined up to multiplication by a non-zero scalar.  The implementable elements form a semigroup, containing SL(2, R ). Since the representation has positive energy, the bounded compact self-adjoint operators        S  0    (  t  )    =   e   -   t   L  0             subscript  S  0   t    superscript  e      t   subscript  L  0        \displaystyle{S_{0}(t)=e^{-tL_{0}}}     for t > 0 implement the group elements in exp C 1 .  It follows that all elements of the Olshanski semigroup and its closure are implemented.  Maximality of the Olshanki semigroup implies that no other elements of SL(2, C ) are implemented. Indeed otherwise every element of SL(2, C ) would be implemented by a bounded operator, which would condradict the non-invertibility of the operators S 0 ( t ) for t > 0.  In the Schrödinger representation the operators S 0 ( t ) for t > 0 are given by Mehler's formula. They are contraction operators , positive and in every Schatten class . Moreover they leave invariant each of the Sobolev spaces. The same formula is true for      ℜ   t   >  0        t   0    \Re\,t>0   by analytic continuation.  It can be seen directly in the Fock model that the implementing operators can be chosen so that they define an ordinary representation of the double cover of H constructed above. The corresponding semigroup of contraction operators is called the oscillator semigroup . The extended oscillator semigroup is obtained by taking the semidirect product with the operators W ( u ). These operators lie in every Schatten class and leave invariant the Sobolev spaces and the space of entire vectors for W .  The decomposition       H  ¯   =   G  ⋅   exp   C  ¯          normal-¯  H    normal-⋅  G     normal-¯  C       \displaystyle{\overline{H}=G\cdot\exp\overline{C}}     corresponds at the operator level to the polar decomposition of bounded operators .  Moreover since any matrix in H is conjugate to a diagonal matrix by elements in H or H −1 , every operator in the oscillator semigroup is quasi-similar to an operator S 0 ( t ) with     ℜ  t   >  0        t   0    \Re t>0   . In particular it has the same spectrum consisting of simple eigenvalues.  In the Fock model, if the element g of the Olshanki semigroup H corresponds to the matrix       (     a    b      c    d     )   ,      a  b    c  d     \displaystyle{\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\

Operators in the extended oscillator semigroup are given by similar expressions with additional linear terms in z and w appearing in the exponential.  In the disk model for the two irreducible components of the metaplectic representation, the corresponding operators are given by         π  ±    (  g  )    F  ±    (  z  )    =     (    -    b  ¯   z    +   d  ¯    )     -  1   ±   1  /  2      F  ±    (      a  ¯   z   -   c  ¯      -    b  ¯   z    +   d  ¯     )     .         subscript  π  plus-or-minus   g   subscript  F  plus-or-minus   z      superscript         normal-¯  b   z     normal-¯  d     plus-or-minus    1     1  2      subscript  F  plus-or-minus          normal-¯  a   z    normal-¯  c           normal-¯  b   z     normal-¯  d        \displaystyle{\pi_{\pm}(g)F_{\pm}(z)=(-\overline{b}z+\overline{d})^{-1\pm 1/2}%

So if F is supported in | z | ≤ R , then        ∥   W   (  F  )    ∥   ≤    e    R  2   /  2      ∥   F  ^   ∥   ∞     .       norm    W  F       superscript  e     superscript  R  2   2     subscript   norm   normal-^  F         \displaystyle{\|W(F)\|\leq e^{R^{2}/2}\|\widehat{F}\|_{\infty}.}     The property of D −1 is proved by taking      S  =   ψ   (  a  )        S    ψ  a     \displaystyle{S=\psi(a)}     with        a   (  z  )    =   1     |  z  |   2   +  1     .        a  z     1     superscript    z   2   1      \displaystyle{a(z)={1\over|z|^{2}+1}.}     Then R = I – DS lies in Ψ −1 , so that      A  ∼   S  +   S  R   +   S   R  2    +  ⋯      similar-to  A    S    S  R     S   superscript  R  2    normal-⋯     \displaystyle{A\sim S+SR+SR^{2}+\cdots}     lies in Ψ −2 and T = DA – I is smoothing. Hence       D   -  1    =   A  -    D   -  1    T         superscript  D    1      A     superscript  D    1    T      \displaystyle{D^{-1}=A-D^{-1}T}     lies in Ψ −2 since D −1  T is smoothing.  The property for D 1/2 is established similarly by constructing B in Ψ 1/2 with real symbol such that D – B 4 is a smoothing operator. Using the holomorphic functional calculus it can be checked that D 1/2 – B 2 is a smoothing operator.  The boundedness result above was used by  to establish the more general inequality of Alberto Calderón and Remi Vaillancourt for pseudodifferential operators . An alternative proof that applies more generally to Fourier integral operators was given by . He showed that such operators can be expressed as integrals over the oscillator semigroup and then estimated using the Cotlar-Stein lemma . 32  Applications and generalizations  Theory for finite abelian groups  noted that the formalism of the Stone–von Neumann theorem and the oscillator representation of the symplectic group extends from the real numbers R to any locally compact abelian group . A particularly simple example is provided by finite abelian groups , where the proofs are either elementary or simplifications of the proofs for R . 33 34  Let A be a finite abelian group, written additively, and let Q be a non-degenerate quadratic form on A with values in T . Thus       (  a  ,  b  )   =   Q   (  a  )   Q   (  b  )   Q    (   a  +  b   )    -  1          a  b     Q  a  Q  b  Q   superscript    a  b     1       \displaystyle{(a,b)=Q(a)Q(b)Q(a+b)^{-1}}     is a symmetric bilinear form on A that is non-degenerate, so permits an identification between A and its dual group  A * = Hom ( A , T ).  Let       V  =    ℓ  2    (  A  )     ,      V     superscript  normal-ℓ  2   A     \displaystyle{V=\ell^{2}(A),}     the space of complex-valued functions on A with inner product        (  f  ,  g  )   =    ∑   x  ∈  A     f   (  x  )     g   (  x  )    ¯      .       f  g     subscript     x  A      f  x   normal-¯    g  x        \displaystyle{(f,g)=\sum_{x\in A}f(x)\overline{g(x)}.}     Define operators on V by        U   (  x  )   f   (  t  )    =   f   (   t  -  x   )     ,    V   (  y  )   f   (  t  )    =    (  y  ,  t  )   f   (  t  )        formulae-sequence      U  x  f  t     f    t  x         V  y  f  t      y  t   f  t      \displaystyle{U(x)f(t)=f(t-x),\,\,\,V(y)f(t)=(y,t)f(t)}     for x , y in A . Then U ( x ) and V ( y ) are unitary representations of A on V satisfying the commutation relations        U   (  x  )   V   (  y  )    =    (  x  ,  y  )   V   (  y  )   U   (  x  )     .

Let G = A x A and for z = ( x , y ) in G set        W   (  z  )    =   U   (  x  )   V   (  y  )     .        W  z     U  x  V  y     \displaystyle{W(z)=U(x)V(y).}     Then        W   (   z  1   )   W   (   z  2   )    =   B   (   z  1   ,   z  2   )   W   (   z  2   )   W   (   z  1   )     ,        W   subscript  z  1   W   subscript  z  2      B    subscript  z  1    subscript  z  2    W   subscript  z  2   W   subscript  z  1      \displaystyle{W(z_{1})W(z_{2})=B(z_{1},z_{2})W(z_{2})W(z_{1}),}     where        B   (   z  1   ,   z  2   )    =    (   x  1   ,   y  2   )     (   x  2   ,   y  1   )    -  1      ,        B    subscript  z  1    subscript  z  2         subscript  x  1    subscript  y  2     superscript    subscript  x  2    subscript  y  1      1       \displaystyle{B(z_{1},z_{2})=(x_{1},y_{2})(x_{2},y_{1})^{-1},}     a non-degenerate alternating bilinear form on G . The uniqueness result above implies that if W '( z ) is another family of unitaries giving a projective reprentation of G such that         W  ′    (   z  1   )    W  ′    (   z  2   )    =   B   (   z  1   ,   z  2   )    W  ′    (   z  2   )    W  ′    (   z  1   )     ,         superscript  W  normal-′    subscript  z  1    superscript  W  normal-′    subscript  z  2      B    subscript  z  1    subscript  z  2     superscript  W  normal-′    subscript  z  2    superscript  W  normal-′    subscript  z  1      \displaystyle{W^{\prime}(z_{1})W^{\prime}(z_{2})=B(z_{1},z_{2})W^{\prime}(z_{2%

In particular if g is an automorphism of G preserving B , then there is an essentially unique unitary π( g ) such that        W   (   g  z   )    =    λ  g    (  z  )   π   (  g  )   W   (  z  )   π    (  g  )   *     .

The group SL(2. Z ) naturally acts on G = A x A by symplectic automorphisms. It is generated by the matrices        S  =   (     0    1       -  1     0     )    ,   R  =   (     1    0      1    1     )     .     formulae-sequence    S    0  1      1   0       R    1  0    1  1       \displaystyle{S=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\

This is in fact a holomorphic map into each Sobolev space H k and hence also H ≈ =   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   .  On the other hand, in H –≈ =    𝒮  ′     superscript  𝒮  normal-′    \mathcal{S}^{\prime}   (in fact in H –1 ) there is a finite-dimensional space of distributions invariant under SL(2, Z ) and isomorphic to the N -dimensional oscillator representation on     ℓ  2    (  A  )        superscript  normal-ℓ  2   A    \ell^{2}(A)   where A = Z / N Z .  In fact let m > 0 and set N = 2 m . Let       M  =     2  π  m    ⋅  𝐙    .      M   normal-⋅      2  π  m    𝐙     \displaystyle{M=\sqrt{2\pi m}\cdot\mathbf{Z}.}     The operators U ( x ), V ( y ) with x and y in M all commute and have a finite-dimensional subspace of fixed vectors formed by the distributions       Ψ  b   =    ∑   x  ∈  M     δ   x  +  b          subscript  normal-Ψ  b     subscript     x  M     subscript  δ    x  b       \displaystyle{\Psi_{b}=\sum\nolimits_{x\in M}\delta_{x+b}}     with b in M 1 , where        M  1   =    1   2  m    M   ⊃  M   .         subscript  M  1       1    2  m    M     superset-of    M     M_{1}={1\over 2m}M\supset M.     The sum defining Ψ b converges in H –1 ⊂    𝒮  ′     superscript  𝒮  normal-′    \mathcal{S}^{\prime}   and depends only on the class of b in M 1 / M . On the other hand the operators U ( x ) and V ( y ) with 'x , y in M 1 commute with all the corresponding operators for M . So M 1 leaves the subspace V 0 spanned by the Ψ b invariant. Hence the group A = M 1 acts on V 0 . This action can immediately be identified with the action on V for the N -dimensional oscillator representation associated with A , since         U   (  b  )    Ψ   b  ′     =   Ψ   b  +   b  ′      ,    V   (  b  )    Ψ   b  ′     =    e   -   i  m  b   b  ′       Ψ   b  ′       .     formulae-sequence      U  b   subscript  normal-Ψ   superscript  b  normal-′      subscript  normal-Ψ    b   superscript  b  normal-′          V  b   subscript  normal-Ψ   superscript  b  normal-′        superscript  e      i  m  b   superscript  b  normal-′       subscript  normal-Ψ   superscript  b  normal-′        U(b)\Psi_{b^{\prime}}=\Psi_{b+b^{\prime}},\qquad V(b)\Psi_{b^{\prime}}=e^{-%
 imbb^{\prime}}\Psi_{b^{\prime}}.     Since the operators π( R ) and π( S ) normalise the two sets of operators U and V corresponding to M and M 1 , it follows that they leave V 0 invariant and on V 0 must be constant multiples of the operators associated with the oscillator representation of A . In fact they coincide. From R this is immediate from the definitions, which show that        R   (   Ψ  b   )    =    e   π  i  m   b  2      Ψ  b     .

For S it follows from the Poisson summation formula and the commutation properties with the operators U ) x ) and V ( y ). The Poisson summation is proved classically as follows. 35  For a > 0 and f in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   let        F   (  t  )    =    ∑   x  ∈  M     f   (   x  +  t   )      .        F  t     subscript     x  M      f    x  t       F(t)=\sum\nolimits_{x\in M}f(x+t).     F is a smooth function on R with period a :        F   (   t  +  a   )    =   F   (  t  )     .        F    t  a      F  t     F(t+a)=F(t).     The theory of Fourier series shows that       F   (  0  )    =    ∑   n  ∈  𝐙     c  n          F  0     subscript     n  𝐙     subscript  c  n      F(0)=\sum\nolimits_{n\in\mathbf{Z}}c_{n}     with the sum absolutely convergent and the Fourier coefficients given by        c  n   =    a   -  1      ∫  0  a    F   (  t  )     e   -    2  π  i  n  t   a      d  t     =    a   -  1      ∫   -  ∞   ∞    f   (  t  )     e   -    2  π  i  n  t   a      d  t     =      2  π    a    f  ^    (     2  π  n   a    )     .         subscript  c  n      superscript  a    1      superscript   subscript   0   a     F  t   superscript  e        2  π  i  n  t   a     d  t             superscript  a    1      superscript   subscript            f  t   superscript  e        2  π  i  n  t   a     d  t                  2  π    a    normal-^  f       2  π  n   a       c_{n}=a^{-1}\int_{0}^{a}F(t)e^{-\frac{2\pi int}{a}}\,dt=a^{-1}\int_{-\infty}^{%
 \infty}f(t)e^{-\frac{2\pi int}{a}}\,dt={\sqrt{2\pi}\over a}\widehat{f}\left(%
 \tfrac{2\pi n}{a}\right).     Hence         ∑   n  ∈  𝐙     f   (   n  a   )     =      2  π    a     ∑   n  ∈  𝐙      f  ^    (     2  π  n   a    )       ,        subscript     n  𝐙      f    n  a             2  π    a     subscript     n  𝐙       normal-^  f       2  π  n   a        \sum\nolimits_{n\in\mathbf{Z}}f(na)=\frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{a}\sum\nolimits_{n\in%
 \mathbf{Z}}\widehat{f}\left(\tfrac{2\pi n}{a}\right),     the usual Poisson summation formula.  This formula shows that S acts as follows        S   (   Ψ  b   )    =     (   2  m   )    -   1  2       ∑    b  ′   ∈    M  1   /  M       e   -   i  m  b   b  ′       Ψ   b  ′        ,        S   subscript  normal-Ψ  b       superscript    2  m       1  2       subscript      superscript  b  normal-′      subscript  M  1   M        superscript  e      i  m  b   superscript  b  normal-′       subscript  normal-Ψ   superscript  b  normal-′         S(\Psi_{b})=(2m)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\sum\nolimits_{b^{\prime}\in M_{1}/M}e^{-imbb^{%

Identifying A with Z /2 m Z , with       b   (  n  )    =      2  π    n    2  m          b  n           2  π    n     2  m      b(n)=\frac{\sqrt{2\pi}n}{2m}     assigned to an integer n modulo 2 m , the theta functions can be defined directly as matrix coefficients: See:                 Θ   m  ,  n     (  τ  ,  z  )    =   (   W   (  z  )    f  τ    ,   Ψ   b   (  n  )     )    .         subscript  normal-Θ   m  n     τ  z       W  z   subscript  f  τ     subscript  normal-Ψ    b  n       \Theta_{m,n}(\tau,z)=(W(z)f_{\tau},\Psi_{b(n)}).

By definition they define holomorphic functions on H × C . The covariance properties of the function f τ and the distribution Ψ b lead immediately to the following transformation laws:         Θ   n  ,  m     (  τ  ,   z  +  a   )    =    Θ   n  ,  m     (  τ  ,  z  )     ,   a  ∈  𝐙      formulae-sequence       subscript  normal-Θ   n  m     τ    z  a        subscript  normal-Θ   n  m     τ  z       a  𝐙     \Theta_{n,m}(\tau,z+a)=\Theta_{n,m}(\tau,z),\qquad a\in\mathbf{Z}            Θ   n  ,  m     (  τ  ,   z  +   b  τ    )    =    q   -   b  2      u   -  b     Θ   n  ,  m     (  τ  ,  z  )     ,   b  ∈  𝐙      formulae-sequence       subscript  normal-Θ   n  m     τ    z    b  τ         superscript  q     superscript  b  2      superscript  u    b     subscript  normal-Θ   n  m     τ  z       b  𝐙     \Theta_{n,m}(\tau,z+b\tau)=q^{-b^{2}}u^{-b}\Theta_{n,m}(\tau,z),\qquad b\in%

In this case the representation is 2-dimensional and the relation        (   π   (  S  )   π   (  R  )    )   3   =   π   (  J  )         superscript    π  S  π  R   3     π  J     \displaystyle{(\pi(S)\pi(R))^{3}=\pi(J)}     on L 2 ( R ) can be checked directly on V 0 .  But in this case      μ  =    1   2     (    e    i  π   4    +   e   -    i  π   4      )    =  1.        μ      1    2       superscript  e      i  π   4     superscript  e        i  π   4            1.     \mu=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(e^{\frac{i\pi}{4}}+e^{-\frac{i\pi}{4}}\right)=1.     The relation can also be checked directly by applying both sides to the ground state exp - x 2 /2.  Consequently it follows that for m ≥ 1 the Gauss sum can be evaluated: 36         ∑   x  ∈    𝐙  /  2   m  𝐙      e     π  i   x  2    /  2   m     =    m    (   1  +  i   )     .        subscript     x      𝐙  2   m  𝐙      superscript  e        π  i   superscript  x  2    2   m         m     1  i      \displaystyle{\sum_{x\in\mathbf{Z}/2m\mathbf{Z}}e^{\pi ix^{2}/2m}=\sqrt{m}(1+i%
 ).}     For ''m '' odd, define        G   (  c  ,  m  )    =    ∑   x  ∈    𝐙  /  m   𝐙      e    2  π  i  c   x  2    /  m      .        G   c  m      subscript     x      𝐙  m   𝐙      superscript  e      2  π  i  c   superscript  x  2    m       \displaystyle{G(c,m)=\sum_{x\in\mathbf{Z}/m\mathbf{Z}}e^{2\pi icx^{2}/m}.}     If m is odd, then, splitting the previous sum up into two parts, it follows that G (1, m ) equals m 1/2 if m is congruent to 1 mod 4 and equals i  m 1/2 otherwise. If p is an odd prime and c is not divisible by p , this implies       G   (  c  ,  p  )    =    (   c  p   )   G   (  1  ,  p  )          G   c  p        c  p   G   1  p      \displaystyle{G(c,p)=\left({c\over p}\right)G(1,p)}     where    (   c  p   )      c  p    \left({c\over p}\right)   is the Legendre symbol equal to 1 if c is a square mod p and –1 otherwise. Moreover if p and q are distinct odd primes, then          G   (  1  ,   p  q   )    /  G    (  1  ,  p  )   G   (  1  ,  q  )    =    (   p  q   )    (   q  p   )     .

 \right)}.     From the formula for G (1, p ) and this relation, the law of quadratic reciprocity follows:         (   p  q   )    (   q  p   )    =    (   -  1   )      (   p  -  1   )    (   q  -  1   )    4     .          p  q     q  p     superscript    1         p  1     q  1    4      \displaystyle{\left({p\over q}\right)\left({q\over p}\right)=(-1)^{\frac{(p-1)%
 (q-1)}{4}}.}     Theory in higher dimensions  The theory of the oscillator representation can be extended from R to R n with the group SL(2, R ) replaced by the symplectic group Sp(2n, R ). The results can be proved either by straightforward generalisations from the one-dimensional case as in  or by using the fact that the n -dimensional case is a tensor product of n one-dimensional cases, reflecting the decomposition:         L  2    (   𝐑  n   )    =    L  2     (  𝐑  )     ⊗  n      .         superscript  L  2    superscript  𝐑  n       superscript  L  2    superscript  𝐑   tensor-product  absent  n       \displaystyle{L^{2}({\mathbf{R}}^{n})=L^{2}({\mathbf{R}})^{\otimes n}.}     Let   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   be the space of Schwartz functions on R n , a dense subspace of L 2 ( R n ). For s , t in R n , define U ( s ) and V ( t ) on   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   and L 2 ( R ) by         U   (  s  )   f   (  x  )    =   f   (   x  -  s   )     ,    V   (  t  )   f   (   t  x   )    =    e    i  x   ⋅  t    f   (  x  )      .     formulae-sequence      U  s  f  x     f    x  s         V  t  f    t  x       superscript  e   normal-⋅    i  x   t    f  x      \displaystyle{U(s)f(x)=f(x-s),\qquad V(t)f(tx)=e^{ix\cdot t}f(x).}     From the definition U and V satisfy the Weyl commutation relation        U   (  s  )   V   (  t  )    =    e   -    i  s   ⋅  t     V   (  t  )   U   (  s  )     .

The Fourier transform is defined on   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   by         f  ^    (  t  )    =    1    (   2  π   )    n  /  2       ∫   𝐑  n     f   (  x  )     e   -    i  x   ⋅  t      d  x      .         normal-^  f   t       1   superscript    2  π     n  2       subscript    superscript  𝐑  n      f  x   superscript  e     normal-⋅    i  x   t     d  x       \displaystyle{\widehat{f}(t)={1\over(2\pi)^{n/2}}\int_{{\mathbf{R}}^{n}}f(x)e^%
 {-ix\cdot t}\,dx.}     The Fourier inversion formula       f   (  x  )    =    1    (   2  π   )    n  /  2       ∫   𝐑  n      f  ^    (  t  )     e    i  x   ⋅  t     d  t           f  x       1   superscript    2  π     n  2       subscript    superscript  𝐑  n       normal-^  f   t   superscript  e   normal-⋅    i  x   t    d  t       \displaystyle{f(x)={1\over(2\pi)^{n/2}}\int_{{\mathbf{R}}^{n}}\widehat{f}(t)e^%
 {ix\cdot t}\,dt}     shows that the Fourier transform is an isomorphism of   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   onto itself extending to a unitary mapping of L 2 ( R n ) onto itself ( Plancherel's theorem ).  The Stone–von Neumann theorem asserts that the Schrödinger representation is irreducible and is the unique irreducible representation of the commutation relations: any other representation is a direct sum of copies of this representation.  If U and V satisfying the Weyl commutation relations, define        W   (  x  ,  y  )    =    e     i  x   ⋅  y   /  2    U   (  x  )   V   (  y  )     .

It follows from the Stone–von Neumann theorem that for each such g there is a unitary π( g ) on L 2 ( R ) satisfying the covariance relation        π   (  g  )   W   (  z  )   π    (  g  )   *    =   W   (   g   (  z  )    )     .        π  g  W  z  π   superscript  g       W    g  z      \displaystyle{\pi(g)W(z)\pi(g)^{*}=W(g(z)).}     By Schur's lemma the unitary π( g ) is unique up to multiplication by a scalar ζ with |ζ| = 1, so that π defines a projective unitary representation of Sp( n ). Representatives can be chosen for π( g ), unique up to a sign, which show that the 2-cocycle for the projective representation of Sp(2 n , R ) takes values ±1. In fact elements of the group Sp( n , R ) are given by 2 n × 2 n real matrices g satisfying        g  J   g  t    =  J   ,        g  J   superscript  g  t    J    \displaystyle{gJg^{t}=J,}     where       J  =   (     0     -  I       I    0     )    .

 x_{i}^{2}.}     The Weyl calculus similarly extends to the n -dimensional case.  The complexification Sp(2 n , C ) of the symplectic group is defined by the same relation, but allowing the matrices A , B , C and D to be complex. The subsemigroup of group elements that take the Siegel upper half plane into itself has a natural double cover. The representations of Mp(2 n , R ) on L 2 ( R n ) and    ℱ  n     subscript  ℱ  n    \mathcal{F}_{n}   extend naturally to a representation of this semigroup by contraction operators defined by kernels, which generalise the one-dimensional case (taking determinants where necessary). The action of Mp(2 n , R ) on coherent states applies equally well to operators in this larger semigroup. 37  As in the 1-dimensional case, where the group SL(2, R ) has a counterpart SU(1,1) threough the Cayley transform with the upper half plane replaced by the unit disc, the symplectic group has a complex counterpart. Indeed if C is the unitary matrix      C  =    1   2     (     I     i  I       I     -   i  I       )        C      1    2      I    i  I     I      i  I         \displaystyle{C={1\over\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}I&iI\\

It consist precisely of Cayley transforms of points Z in the Siegel generalized upper half plane:       W  =    (   Z  -   i  I    )     (   Z  +   i  I    )    -  1      .

The stabilizer subgroup of 0 consists of matrices with A unitary and B = 0.  For W in D n the metaplectic coherent states in holomorphic Fock space are defined by         f  W    (  z  )    =   e     z  t   W  z   /  2     .         subscript  f  W   z    superscript  e       superscript  z  t   W  z   2      \displaystyle{f_{W}(z)=e^{z^{t}Wz/2}.}     The inner product of two such states is given by        (   f   W  1    ,   f   W  2    )   =   det    (   1  -    W  1     W  2   ¯     )    -   1  /  2       .        subscript  f   subscript  W  1     subscript  f   subscript  W  2        superscript    1     subscript  W  1    normal-¯   subscript  W  2          1  2        \displaystyle{(f_{W_{1}},f_{W_{2}})=\det(1-W_{1}\overline{W_{2}})^{-1/2}.}     Moreover the metaplectic representation π satisfies        π   (  g  )    f  W    =   det     (    A  ¯   +    B  ¯   W    )    -   1  /  2      f   g  W       .        π  g   subscript  f  W         superscript     normal-¯  A      normal-¯  B   W        1  2      subscript  f    g  W        \displaystyle{\pi(g)f_{W}=\det(\overline{A}+\overline{B}W)^{-1/2}f_{gW}.}     The closed linear span of these states gives the even part of holomorphic Fock space    ℱ  n  +     superscript   subscript  ℱ  n      \mathcal{F}_{n}^{+}   . The embedding of Sp(2 n ) in Sp(2( n +1)) and the compatible identification       ℱ   n  +  1   +   =    ℱ  n  +   ⊕   ℱ  n  -         superscript   subscript  ℱ    n  1       direct-sum   superscript   subscript  ℱ  n      superscript   subscript  ℱ  n        \displaystyle{\mathcal{F}_{n+1}^{+}=\mathcal{F}_{n}^{+}\oplus\mathcal{F}_{n}^{%
 -}}     lead to an action on the whole of    ℱ  n     subscript  ℱ  n    \mathcal{F}_{n}   . It can be verified directly that it is compatible with the action of the operators W ( z ). 38  Since the complex semigroup has as Shilov boundary the symplectic group, the fact that this representation has a well-defined contractive extension to the semigroup follows from the maximum modulus principle and the fact that the semigroup operators are closed under adjoints. Indeed it suffices to check, for two such operators S , T and vectors v i proportional to metaplectic coherent states, that        |    ∑   i  ,  j     (   S  T   v  i    ,   v  j   )    |   ≤    ∥    ∑  i    v  i    ∥   2    ,          subscript    i  j       S  T   subscript  v  i     subscript  v  j       superscript   norm    subscript   i    subscript  v  i     2     \displaystyle\left|\sum_{i,j}(STv_{i},v_{j})\right|\leq\|\sum_{i}v_{i}\|^{2},     which follows because the sum depends holomorphically on S and T , which are unitary on the boundary.  Index theorems for Toeplitz operators  Let S denote the unit sphere in C n and define the Hardy space H 2 ( S ) be the closure in L 2 ( S ) of the restriction of polynomials in the coordinates z 1 , ..., z n . Let P be the projection onto Hardy space. It is known that if m ( f ) denotes multiplication by a continuous function f on S , then the commutator [P, m ( f )] is compact. Consequently defining the Toeplitz operator by       T   (  f  )    =   P  m   (  f  )   P         T  f     P  m  f  P     \displaystyle{T(f)=Pm(f)P}     on Hardy space, it follows that T ( fg ) – T ( f ) T ( g ) is compact for continuous f and g . The same holds if f and g are matrix-valued functions (so that the corresponding Toeplitz operators are matrices of operators on H 2 ( S )). In particular if f is a function on S taking values in invertible matrices, then        T   (  f  )   T   (   f   -  1    )    -  I   ,    T   (   f   -  1    )   T   (  f  )    -  I          T  f  T   superscript  f    1     I       T   superscript  f    1    T  f   I     \displaystyle{T(f)T(f^{-1})-I,\qquad T(f^{-1})T(f)-I}     are compact and hence T ( f ) is a Fredholm operator with an index defined as         ind   T   (  f  )    =    dim    ker  T    (  f  )     -   dim    ker  T     (  f  )   *       .        ind  T  f      dimension     kernel  T   f     dimension     kernel  T    superscript  f         \displaystyle{\mathrm{ind}\,T(f)=\dim\ker T(f)-\dim\ker T(f)^{*}.}     The index has been computed using the methods of K-theory by  and coincides up to a sign with the degree of f as a continuous mapping from S into the general linear group.  gave an analytic way to establish this index theorem, simplied later by Howe. Their proof relies on the fact if f is smooth then the index is given by the formula of McKean and Singer : 39         ind   T   (  f  )    =     Tr     (   I  -   T   (   f   -  1    )   T   (  f  )     )   n    -    Tr     (   I  -   T   (  f  )   T   (   f   -  1    )     )   n      .        ind  T  f       Tr   superscript    I    T   superscript  f    1    T  f    n      Tr   superscript    I    T  f  T   superscript  f    1      n       \displaystyle{\mathrm{ind}\,T(f)=\mathrm{Tr}\,(I-T(f^{-1})T(f))^{n}-\mathrm{Tr%
 }\,(I-T(f)T(f^{-1}))^{n}.}   noticed that there was a natural unitary isomorphism between H 2 ( S ) and L 2 ( R n ) carrying the Toeplitz operators       T  j   =   T   (   z  j   )         subscript  T  j     T   subscript  z  j      \displaystyle{T_{j}=T(z_{j})}     onto the operators        (    P  j   +   i   Q  j     )    Δ   -   1  /  2      .         subscript  P  j     i   subscript  Q  j      superscript  normal-Δ      1  2       \displaystyle{(P_{j}+iQ_{j})\Delta^{-1/2}.}     These are examples of zeroth order operators constructed within the Weyl calculus. The traces in the McKean-Singer formula can be computed directly using the Weyl calculus, leading to another proof of the index theorem. See:     , Chapter XIX This method of proving index theorems was generalised by Alain Connes within the framework of cyclic cohomology . 40   Theory in infinite dimensions  The theory of the oscillator representation in infinite dimensions is due to Irving Segal and David Shale. See:       Graeme Segal used it to give a mathematically rigorous construction of projective representations of loop groups and the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle. At an infinitesimal level the construction of the representations of the Lie algebras, in this case the affine Kac–Moody algebra and the Virasoro algebra , was already known to physicists, through dual resonance theory and later string theory . Only the simplest case will be considered here, involving the loop group LU(1) of smooth maps of the circle into U(1) = T . The oscillator semigroup, developed independently by Neretin and Segal, allows contraction operators to be defined for the semigroup of univalent holomorphic maps of the unit disc into itself, extending the unitary operators corresponding to diffeomorphisms of the circle. When applied to the subgroup SU(1,1) of the diffeomorphism group, this gives a generalization of the oscillator representation on L 2 ( R ) and its extension to the Olshanskii semigroup.   The representation of commutation on Fock space is generalized to infinite dimensions by replacing C n (or its dual space) by an arbitrary complex Hilbert space H . The symmetric group  S k acts on H ⊗ k . S k ( H ) is defined to be the fixed point subspace of S k and the symmetric algebra is the algebraic direct sum        ⊕   k  ≥  0      S  k    (  H  )     .      subscript  direct-sum    k  0       superscript  S  k   H     \displaystyle{\bigoplus_{k\geq 0}S^{k}(H).}     It has a natural inner product inherited from H ⊗ k :        (    x  1   ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   x  k    ,    y  1   ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   y  k    )   =    k  !   ⋅    ∏   i  =  1   k    (   x  i   ,   y  i   )      .        tensor-product   subscript  x  1   normal-⋯   subscript  x  k     tensor-product   subscript  y  1   normal-⋯   subscript  y  k      normal-⋅    k     superscript   subscript  product    i  1    k     subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i        \displaystyle{(x_{1}\otimes\cdots\otimes x_{k},y_{1}\otimes\cdots\otimes y_{k}%
 )=k!\cdot\prod_{i=1}^{k}(x_{i},y_{i}).}     Taking the components S k ( H ) to be mutually orthogonal, the symmetric Fock space  S ( H ) is defined to be the Hilbert space completion of this direct sum.  For ξ in H define the coherent state e ξ by        e  ξ   =    ∑   k  ≥  0       (   k  !   )    -  1     ξ    ⊗  k       .       superscript  e  ξ     subscript     k  0       superscript    k     1     superscript  ξ   tensor-product  absent  k        \displaystyle{e^{\xi}=\sum_{k\geq 0}(k!)^{-1}\xi^{\otimes k}.}     It follows that their linear span is dense in S ( H ), that the coherent states corresponding to n distinct vectors are linearly independent and that        (   e  ξ   ,   e  η   )   =   e   (  ξ  ,  η  )     .        superscript  e  ξ    superscript  e  η     superscript  e   ξ  η      \displaystyle{(e^{\xi},e^{\eta})=e^{(\xi,\eta)}.}     When H is finite-dimensional, S ( H ) can naturally be identified with holomorphic Fock space for H *, since in the standard way S k ( H ) are just homogeneous polynomials of degree k on H * and the inner products match up. Moreover S ( H ) has functorial properties. Most importantly         S   (    H  1   ⊕   H  2    )    =     S   (   H  1   )    ⊗  S    (   H  2   )     ,    e    x  1   ⊕   x  2     =    e   x  1    ⊗   e   x  2       .     formulae-sequence      S   direct-sum   subscript  H  1    subscript  H  2        tensor-product    S   subscript  H  1    S    subscript  H  2        superscript  e   direct-sum   subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2      tensor-product   superscript  e   subscript  x  1     superscript  e   subscript  x  2        S(H_{1}\oplus H_{2})=S(H_{1})\otimes S(H_{2}),\qquad e^{x_{1}\oplus x_{2}}=e^{%
 x_{1}}\otimes e^{x_{2}}.     A similar result hold for finite orthogonal direct sums and extends to infinite orthogonal direct sums, using von Neumman's definition of the infinite tensor product with 1 the reference unit vector in S 0 ( H i ). Any contraction operator between Hilbert spaces induces a contraction operator between the corresponding symmetric Fock spaces in a functorial way.  A unitary operator on S ( H ) is uniquely determined by it values on coherent states. Moreover for any assignment v ξ such that       (   v  ξ   ,   v  η   )   =   e   (  ξ  ,  η  )          subscript  v  ξ    subscript  v  η     superscript  e   ξ  η      \displaystyle{(v_{\xi},v_{\eta})=e^{(\xi,\eta)}}     there is a unique unitary operator U on S ( H ) such that        v  ξ   =   U   (   e  ξ   )     .       subscript  v  ξ     U   superscript  e  ξ      \displaystyle{v_{\xi}=U(e^{\xi}).}     As in the finite-dimensional case, this allows the unitary operators W ( x ) to be defined for x in H :        W   (  x  )    e  y    =    e   -     ∥  x  ∥   2   /  2      e   -   (  x  ,  y  )      e   x  +  y      .        W  x   superscript  e  y       superscript  e       superscript   norm  x   2   2      superscript  e     x  y      superscript  e    x  y       \displaystyle{W(x)e^{y}=e^{-\|x\|^{2}/2}e^{-(x,y)}e^{x+y}.}     It follows immediately from the finite-dimensional case that these operators are unitary and satisfy        W   (  x  )   W   (  y  )    =    e   -    i  2    ℑ   (  x  ,  y  )       W   (   x  +  y   )     .        W  x  W  y      superscript  e        i  2     x  y      W    x  y      \displaystyle{W(x)W(y)=e^{-{i\over 2}\Im(x,y)}W(x+y).}     In particular the Weyl commutation relations are satisfied:        W   (  x  )   W   (  y  )    =    e   -   i   ℑ   (  x  ,  y  )       W   (  y  )   W   (  x  )     .        W  x  W  y      superscript  e      i    x  y      W  y  W  x     \displaystyle{W(x)W(y)=e^{-i\Im(x,y)}W(y)W(x).}     Taking an orthonormal basis e n of H , S ( H ) can be written as an infinite tensor product of the S ( C  e n ). The irreducibility of W on each of these spaces implies the irreducibility of W on the whole of S ( H ). W is called the complex wave representation .  To define the symplectic group in infinite dimensions let H R be the underlying real vector space of H with the symplectic form       B   (  x  ,  y  )    =   -   ℑ   (  x  ,  y  )           B   x  y        x  y      \displaystyle{B(x,y)=-\Im(x,y)}     and real inner product         (  x  ,  y  )   𝐑   =   ℜ   (  x  ,  y  )     .       subscript   x  y   𝐑     x  y     \displaystyle{(x,y)_{\mathbf{R}}=\Re(x,y).}     The complex structure is then defined by the orthogonal operator       J   (  x  )    =   i  x         J  x     i  x     \displaystyle{J(x)=ix}     so that        B   (  x  ,  y  )    =   -    (   J  x   ,  y  )   𝐑     .        B   x  y       subscript     J  x   y   𝐑      \displaystyle{B(x,y)=-(Jx,y)_{\mathbf{R}}.}     A bounded invertible operator real linear operator T on H R lies in the symplectic group if it and its inverse preserve B . This is equivalent to the conditions:        T  J   T  t    =  J  =    T  t   J  T    .          T  J   superscript  T  t    J          superscript  T  t   J  T      \displaystyle{TJT^{t}=J=T^{t}JT.}     The operator T is said to be implementable on S ( H ) provided there is a unitary π( T ) such that        π   (  T  )   W   (  x  )   π    (  T  )   *    =   W   (   T  x   )     .        π  T  W  x  π   superscript  T       W    T  x      \displaystyle{\pi(T)W(x)\pi(T)^{*}=W(Tx).}     The implementable operators form a subgroup of the symplectic group, the restricted symplectic group . By Schur's lemma, π( T ) is uniquely determined up to a scalar in T , so π gives a projective unitary representation of this subgroup.  The Segal-Shale quantization criterion states that T is implementable, i.e. lies in the restricted symplectic group, if and only if the commutator TJ – JT is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator .  Unlike the finite-dimensional case where a lifting π could be chosen so that it was multiplicative up to a sign, this is not possible in the infinite-dimensional case. (This can be seen directly using the example of the projective representation of the diffeomorphism group of the circle constructed below.)  The projective representation of the restricted symplectic group can be constructed directly on coherent states as in the finite-dimensional case. 41  In fact, choosing a real Hilbert subspace of H of which H is a complexification, for any operator T on H a complex conjugate of T is also defined. Then the infinite-dimensional analogue of SU(1,1) consists of invertible bounded operators      g  =   (     A    B       B  ¯      A  ¯      )       g    A  B     normal-¯  B    normal-¯  A       \displaystyle{g=\begin{pmatrix}A&B\\
 \overline{B}&\overline{A}\end{pmatrix}}     satisfying gKg * = K (or equivalently the same relations as in the finite-dimensional case). These belong to the restricted symplectic group if and only if B is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator. This group acts transitively on the infinite-dimensional analogue D ≈ of the Seigel generalized unit disk consisting of Hilbert–Schmidt operators W that are symmetric with operator norm less than 1 via the formula        g  Z   =    (    A  W   +  B   )     (     B  ¯   W   +   A  ¯    )    -  1      .        g  Z         A  W   B    superscript       normal-¯  B   W    normal-¯  A      1       \displaystyle{gZ=(AW+B)(\overline{B}W+\overline{A})^{-1}.}     Again the stsblilizer subgroup of 0 consists of g with A unitary and B = 0. The metaplectic coherent states f W can be defined as before and their inner product is given by the same formula, using the Fredholm determinant :        (   f   W  1    ,   f   W  2    )   =   det    (   I  -    W  2  *    W  1     )    -   1  /  2       .        subscript  f   subscript  W  1     subscript  f   subscript  W  2        superscript    I     superscript   subscript  W  2      subscript  W  1         1  2        \displaystyle{(f_{W_{1}},f_{W_{2}})=\det(I-W_{2}^{*}W_{1})^{-1/2}.}     Define unit vectors by       e  W   =   det     (   I  -    W  *   W    )    1  /  4     f  W          subscript  e  W        superscript    I     superscript  W    W      1  4     subscript  f  W       \displaystyle{e_{W}=\det(I-W^{*}W)^{1/4}f_{W}}     and set        π   (  g  )    e  W    =   μ   (   det    (   I  +     A  ¯    -  1     B  ¯   W    )    -   1  /  2      )    e   g  W      ,        π  g   subscript  e  W      μ     superscript    I     superscript   normal-¯  A     1     normal-¯  B   W        1  2       subscript  e    g  W       \displaystyle{\pi(g)e_{W}=\mu(\det(I+\overline{A}^{-1}\overline{B}W)^{-1/2})e_%
 {gW},}     where μ(ζ) = ζ/|ζ|. As before this defines a projective representation and, if g 3 = g 1 g 2 , the cocycle is given by        ω   (   g  1   ,   g  2   )    =   μ   [   det    (    A  3     (    A  1    A  2    )    -  1     )    -   1  /  2      ]     .        ω    subscript  g  1    subscript  g  2       μ   delimited-[]     superscript     subscript  A  3    superscript     subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2      1         1  2          \displaystyle{\omega(g_{1},g_{2})=\mu[\det(A_{3}(A_{1}A_{2})^{-1})^{-1/2}].}     This representation extends by analytic continuation to define contraction operators for the complex semigroup by the same analytic continuation argument as in the finite-dimensional case. It can also be shown that they are strict contractions.  Example Let H R be the real Hilbert space consisting of real-valued functions on the circle with mean 0       f   (  θ  )    =    ∑   n  ≠  0      a  n    e   i  n  θ            f  θ     subscript     n  0       subscript  a  n    superscript  e    i  n  θ        \displaystyle{f(\theta)=\sum_{n\neq 0}a_{n}e^{in\theta}}     and for which         ∑   n  ≠  0      |  n  |     |   a  n   |   2     <  ∞   .        subscript     n  0        n    superscript     subscript  a  n    2        \displaystyle{\sum_{n\neq 0}|n||a_{n}|^{2}<\infty.}     The inner product is given by        (   ∑    a  n    e   i  n  θ      ,   ∑    b  m    e   i  m  θ      )   =    ∑   n  ≠  0      |  n  |    a  n     b  n   ¯      .            subscript  a  n    superscript  e    i  n  θ           subscript  b  m    superscript  e    i  m  θ         subscript     n  0        n    subscript  a  n    normal-¯   subscript  b  n        \left(\sum a_{n}e^{in\theta},\sum b_{m}e^{im\theta}\right)=\sum_{n\neq 0}|n|a_%
 {n}\overline{b_{n}}.     An orthogonal basis is given by the function sin( n θ) and cos( n θ) for n > 0. The Hilbert transform on the circle defined by        J   sin   (   n  θ   )     =   cos   (   n  θ   )     ,    J   cos   (   n  θ   )     =   -   sin   (   n  θ   )         formulae-sequence      J      n  θ         n  θ         J      n  θ           n  θ        J\sin(n\theta)=\cos(n\theta),\qquad J\cos(n\theta)=-\sin(n\theta)     defines a complex structure on H R . J can also be written        J    ∑   n  ≠  0      a  n    e   i  n  θ       =    ∑   n  ≠  0      i   sign   (  n  )    a  n    e   i  n  θ       ,        J    subscript     n  0       subscript  a  n    superscript  e    i  n  θ         subscript     n  0      i  sign  n   subscript  a  n    superscript  e    i  n  θ        J\sum_{n\neq 0}a_{n}e^{in\theta}=\sum_{n\neq 0}i\,\mathrm{sign}(n)a_{n}e^{in%

See:       The operators W ( f ) with f smooth correspond to a subgroup of the loop group L T invariant under the diffeomorphism group of the circle. The infinitesimal operators corresponding to the vector fields       L  n   =   -   π   (   i   e   i  n  θ     d   d  θ     )          subscript  L  n       π    i   superscript  e    i  n  θ      d    d  θ         \displaystyle{L_{n}=-\pi\left(ie^{in\theta}{d\over d\theta}\right)}     can be computed explicitly. They satisfy the Virasoro relations        [   L  m   ,   L  n   ]   =     (   m  -  n   )    L   m  +  n     +      m  3   -  m   12    δ    m  +  n   ,  0       .        subscript  L  m    subscript  L  n          m  n    subscript  L    m  n            superscript  m  3   m   12    subscript  δ     m  n   0        \displaystyle{[L_{m},L_{n}]=(m-n)L_{m+n}+{m^{3}-m\over 12}\delta_{m+n,0}.}     In particular they cannor be adjusted by addition of scalar operators to remove the second term on the right hand side. This shows that the cocycle on the restricted symplectic group is not equivalent to one taking only the values ±1.
