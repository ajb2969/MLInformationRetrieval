   Sullivan conjecture      Sullivan conjecture  In [[mathematics]], '''Sullivan conjecture''' can refer to any of several results and conjectures prompted by [[homotopy theory]] work of [[Dennis Sul livan]]. A basic theme and motivation concerns the fixed point set in group actions of a finite group    G   G   G   . The most elementary formulation, however, is in terms of the classifying space     B  G      B  G    BG   of such a group. Roughly speaking, it is difficult to map such a space    B  G      B  G    BG   continuously into a finite CW complex    X   X   X   in a non-trivial manner. Such a version of the Sullivan conjecture was first proved by Haynes Miller . 1 Specifically, in 1984, Miller proved that the function space , carrying the compact-open topology , of base point -preserving mappings from    B  G      B  G    BG   to   X   X   X   is weakly contractible .  This is equivalent to the statement that the map   X   X   X   →    F   (   B  G   ,  X  )       F     B  G   X     F(BG,X)   from X to the function space of maps    B  G      B  G    BG   →   X   X   X   , not necessarily preserving the base point, given by sending a point   x   x   x   of   X   X   X   to the constant map whose image is   x   x   x   is a weak equivalence . The mapping space    F   (   B  G   ,  X  )       F     B  G   X     F(BG,X)   is an example of a homotopy fixed point set. Specifically,    F   (   B  G   ,  X  )       F     B  G   X     F(BG,X)   is the homotopy fixed point set of the group   G   G   G   acting by the trivial action on   X   X   X   . In general, for a group   G   G   G   acting on a space   X   X   X   , the homotopy fixed points are the fixed points    F    (   E  G   ,  X  )   G       F   superscript     E  G   X   G     F(EG,X)^{G}   of the mapping space    F   (   E  G   ,  X  )       F     E  G   X     F(EG,X)   of maps from the universal cover     E  G      E  G    EG   of    B  G      B  G    BG   to   X   X   X   under the   G   G   G   -action on    F   (   E  G   ,  X  )       F     E  G   X     F(EG,X)   given by   g   g   g   in   G   G   G   acts on a map   f   f   f   in    F   (   E  G   ,  X  )       F     E  G   X     F(EG,X)   by sending it to    g  f   g   -  1        g  f   superscript  g    1      gfg^{-1}   . The   G   G   G   -equivariant map from    E  G      E  G    EG   to a single point   *     *   induces a natural map η     X  G   =   F    (  *  ,  X  )   G         superscript  X  G     F   superscript    X   G      X^{G}=F(*,X)^{G}   →    F    (   E  G   ,  X  )   G       F   superscript     E  G   X   G     F(EG,X)^{G}   from the fixed points to the homotopy fixed points of   G   G   G   acting on   X   X   X   . Miller's theorem is that η is a weak equivalence for trivial   G   G   G   -actions on finite-dimensional CW complexes. An important ingredient and motivation (see [1]) for his proof is a result of Gunnar Carlsson on the homology of     B  Z   /  2        B  Z   2    BZ/2   as an unstable module over the Steenrod algebra . 2  Miller's theorem generalizes to a version of Sullivan's conjecture in which the action on   X   X   X   is allowed to be non-trivial. In, 3 Sullivan conjectured that η is a weak equivalence after a certain p-completion procedure due to A. Bousfield and D. Kan for the group    G  =   Z  /  2       G    Z  2     G=Z/2   . This conjecture was incorrect as stated, but a correct version was given by Miller, and proven independently by Dwyer-Miller-Neisendorfer, 4 Carlsson, 5 and Jean Lannes, 6 showing that the natural map     (   X  G   )   p     subscript   superscript  X  G   p    (X^{G})_{p}   →    F    (   E  G   ,    (  X  )   p   )   G       F   superscript     E  G    subscript  X  p    G     F(EG,(X)_{p})^{G}   is a weak equivalence when the order of   G   G   G   is a power of a prime p, and where     (  X  )   p     subscript  X  p    (X)_{p}   denotes the Bousfield-Kan p-completion of   X   X   X   . Miller's proof involves an unstable Adams spectral sequence , Carlsson's proof uses his affirmative solution of the Segal conjecture and also provides information about the homotopy fixed points    F    (   E  G   ,  X  )   G       F   superscript     E  G   X   G     F(EG,X)^{G}   before completion, and Lannes's proof involves his T-functor. 7  References    External links    [ http://books.google.com/books?id=rjMXVqEiA7MC&pg; ;=PA67&lpg;=PA67&dq;=%22sullivan+conjecture%22&source;=web&ots;=nI3OJJQN2J&sig;=DFx0MSsGdiyvyZlbHT825picIbU#PPA68,M1 Book extract]  J.
