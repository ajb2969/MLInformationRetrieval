Sullivan conjecture
In [[mathematics]], '''Sullivan conjecture''' can refer to any of several results and conjectures prompted by [[homotopy theory]] work of [[Dennis Sul
 livan]]. A basic theme and motivation concerns the fixed point set in group actions of a finite group

 
 . The most elementary formulation, however, is in terms of the classifying space

 
  of such a group. Roughly speaking, it is difficult to map such a space 
 
 
 
  continuously into a finite CW complex

 
  in a non-trivial manner. Such a version of the Sullivan conjecture was first proved by Haynes Miller.1 Specifically, in 1984, Miller proved that the function space, carrying the compact-open topology, of base point-preserving mappings from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  is weakly contractible.
This is equivalent to the statement that the map 
 
 
 
  → 
 
 
 
  from X to the function space of maps 
 
 
 
  → 
 
 
 
 , not necessarily preserving the base point, given by sending a point 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  to the constant map whose image is 
 
 
 
  is a weak equivalence. The mapping space 
 
 
 
  is an example of a homotopy fixed point set. Specifically, 
 
 
 
  is the homotopy fixed point set of the group 
 
 
 
  acting by the trivial action on 
 
 
 
 . In general, for a group 
 
 
 
  acting on a space 
 
 
 
 , the homotopy fixed points are the fixed points 
 
 
 
  of the mapping space 
 
 
 
  of maps from the universal cover

 
  of 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  under the 
 
 
 
 -action on 
 
 
 
  given by 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  acts on a map 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  by sending it to 
 
 
 
 . The 
 
 
 
 -equivariant map from 
 
 
 
  to a single point 
 
 
 
  induces a natural map η
 
 
 
 →
 
 
 
  from the fixed points to the homotopy fixed points of 
 
 
 
  acting on 
 
 
 
 . Miller's theorem is that η is a weak equivalence for trivial 
 
 
 
 -actions on finite-dimensional CW complexes. An important ingredient and motivation (see [1]) for his proof is a result of Gunnar Carlsson on the homology of 
 
 
 
  as an unstable module over the Steenrod algebra.2
Miller's theorem generalizes to a version of Sullivan's conjecture in which the action on 
 
 
 
  is allowed to be non-trivial. In,3 Sullivan conjectured that η is a weak equivalence after a certain p-completion procedure due to A. Bousfield and D. Kan for the group 
 
 
 
 . This conjecture was incorrect as stated, but a correct version was given by Miller, and proven independently by Dwyer-Miller-Neisendorfer,4 Carlsson,5 and Jean Lannes,6 showing that the natural map 
 
 
 
  → 
 
 
 
  is a weak equivalence when the order of 
 
 
 
  is a power of a prime p, and where 
 
 
 
  denotes the Bousfield-Kan p-completion of 
 
 
 
 . Miller's proof involves an unstable Adams spectral sequence, Carlsson's proof uses his affirmative solution of the Segal conjecture and also provides information about the homotopy fixed points 
 
 
 
  before completion, and Lannes's proof involves his T-functor.7
