Phenol O-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a phenol O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + phenol 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + anisole
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and phenol, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and anisole.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:phenol O-methyltransferase. This enzyme is also called PMT. This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism.
