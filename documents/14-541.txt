Highest-weight category

In the mathematical field of representation theory, a highest-weight category is a k-linear category C (here k is a field) that

is locally artinian1
has enough injectives
satisfies








for all subobjects B and each family of subobjects {Aα} of each object X


and such that there is a locally finite poset Λ (whose elements are called the weights of C) that satisfies the following conditions:2

The poset Λ indexes an exhaustive set of non-isomorphic simple objects {S(λ)} in C.
Λ also indexes a collection of objects {A(λ)} of objects of C such that there exist embeddings S(λ) → A(λ) such that all composition factors S(μ) of A(λ)/S(λ) satisfy μ Here, a composition factor of an object A in C is, by definition, a composition factor of one of its finite length subobjects.
For all μ, λ in Λ,








is finite, and the multiplicity3




is also finite.
 


Each S(λ) has an injective envelope I(λ) in C equipped with an increasing filtration








such that
 



for n > 1, 
 
 
 
  for some μ = μ(n) > λ
for each μ in Λ, μ(n) = μ for only finitely many n






Examples

The module category of the 
 
 
 
 -algebra of upper triangular 
 
 
 
 
  matrices over 
 
 
 
 .
This concept is named after the category of highest-weight modules of Lie-algebras.
A finite-dimensional 
 
 
 
 -algebra 
 
 
 
  is quasi-hereditary iff its module category is a highest-weight category. In particular all module-categories over semisimple and hereditary algebras are highest-weight categories.
A cellular algebra over a field is quasi-hereditary (and hence its module category a highest-weight category) iff its Cartan-determinant is 1.

Here, if A is an object in C and S is a simple object in C, the multiplicity [A:S] is, by definition, the supremum of the multiplicity of S in all finite length subobjects of A.↩
