   Highest-weight category      Highest-weight category   In the mathematical field of representation theory , a highest-weight category is a k -linear category  C (here k is a field ) that   is locally artinian 1  has enough injectives  satisfies          B  ∩   (    ⋃  α    A  α    )    =    ⋃  α    (   B  ∩   A  α    )          B    subscript   α    subscript  A  α       subscript   α     B   subscript  A  α       B\cap\left(\bigcup_{\alpha}A_{\alpha}\right)=\bigcup_{\alpha}\left(B\cap A_{%
 \alpha}\right)       for all subobjects B and each family of subobjects { A α } of each object X    and such that there is a locally finite poset Λ (whose elements are called the weights of C ) that satisfies the following conditions: 2   The poset Λ indexes an exhaustive set of non-isomorphic simple objects { S ( λ )} in C .  Λ also indexes a collection of objects { A ( λ )} of objects of C such that there exist embeddings S ( λ ) → A ( λ ) such that all composition factors  S ( μ ) of A ( λ )/ S ( λ ) satisfy μ Here, a composition factor of an object A in C is, by definition, a composition factor of one of its finite length subobjects.  For all μ , λ in Λ,          dim  k     Hom  k    (   A   (  λ  )    ,   A   (  μ  )    )        subscript  dimension  k     subscript  Hom  k     A  λ     A  μ      \dim_{k}\operatorname{Hom}_{k}(A(\lambda),A(\mu))       is finite, and the multiplicity 3      [    A   (  λ  )    :   S   (  μ  )     ]     delimited-[]   normal-:    A  λ     S  μ      [A(\lambda):S(\mu)]      is also finite.    Each S ( λ ) has an injective envelope  I ( λ ) in C equipped with an increasing filtration         0  =    F  0    (  λ  )    ⊆    F  1    (  λ  )    ⊆  …  ⊆   I   (  λ  )          0     subscript  F  0   λ           subscript  F  1   λ        normal-…         I  λ      0=F_{0}(\lambda)\subseteq F_{1}(\lambda)\subseteq\dots\subseteq I(\lambda)       such that        F  1    (  λ  )    =   A   (  λ  )           subscript  F  1   λ     A  λ     F_{1}(\lambda)=A(\lambda)     for n > 1,        F  n    (  λ  )    /   F   n  -  1      (  λ  )    ≅   A   (  μ  )               subscript  F  n   λ    subscript  F    n  1     λ     A  μ     F_{n}(\lambda)/F_{n-1}(\lambda)\cong A(\mu)   for some μ = μ ( n ) > λ  for each μ in Λ, μ ( n ) = μ for only finitely many n         ⋃  i     F  i    (  λ  )     =   I   (  λ  )     .        subscript   i      subscript  F  i   λ      I  λ     \bigcup_{i}F_{i}(\lambda)=I(\lambda).        Examples   The module category of the   k   k   k   -algebra of upper triangular    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n   matrices over   k   k   k   .  This concept is named after the category of highest-weight modules of Lie-algebras.  A finite-dimensional   k   k   k   -algebra   A   A   A   is quasi-hereditary iff its module category is a highest-weight category. In particular all module-categories over semisimple and hereditary algebras are highest-weight categories.  A cellular algebra over a field is quasi-hereditary (and hence its module category a highest-weight category) iff its Cartan-determinant is 1.
