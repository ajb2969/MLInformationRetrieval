   Cyclopentanol dehydrogenase      Cyclopentanol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a cyclopentanol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cyclopentanol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cyclopentanone + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cyclopentanol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are cyclopentanone , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cyclopentanol:NAD + oxidoreductase .  References      "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
