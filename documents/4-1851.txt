   Debye length      Debye length   In plasmas and electrolytes the Debye length (also called Debye radius ), named after the Dutch physicist and physical chemist Peter Debye , is the measure of a charge carrier's net electrostatic effect in solution, and how far those electrostatic effects persist. A Debye sphere is a volume whose radius is the Debye length, in which there is a sphere of influence, and outside of which charges are electrically screened . The notion of Debye length plays an important role in plasma physics , electrolytes and colloids ( DLVO theory ).  Physical origin  The Debye length arises naturally in the thermodynamic description of large systems of mobile charges. In a system of   N   N   N   different species of charges, the   j   j   j   -th species carries charge    q  j     subscript  q  j    q_{j}   and has concentration      n  j    (  𝐫  )        subscript  n  j   𝐫    n_{j}(\mathbf{r})   at position   𝐫   𝐫   \mathbf{r}   . According to the so-called "primitive model", these charges are distributed in a continuous medium that is characterized only by its relative static permittivity ,    ε  r     subscript  ε  r    \varepsilon_{r}   . This distribution of charges within this medium gives rise to an electric potential     Φ   (  𝐫  )       normal-Φ  𝐫    \Phi(\mathbf{r})   that satisfies Poisson's equation :       ε    ∇  2   Φ    (  𝐫  )    =    -    ∑   j  =  1   N      q  j     n  j    (  𝐫  )      -    ρ  E    (  𝐫  )           ε    superscript  normal-∇  2   normal-Φ   𝐫         superscript   subscript     j  1    N      subscript  q  j    subscript  n  j   𝐫        subscript  ρ  E   𝐫      \varepsilon\nabla^{2}\Phi(\mathbf{r})=-\,\sum_{j=1}^{N}q_{j}\,n_{j}(\mathbf{r}%
 )-\rho_{E}(\mathbf{r})   ,  where    ε  ≡    ε  r    ε  0        ε     subscript  ε  r    subscript  ε  0      \varepsilon\equiv\varepsilon_{r}\varepsilon_{0}   ,    ε  0     subscript  ε  0    \varepsilon_{0}   is the electric constant , and    ρ  E     subscript  ρ  E    \rho_{E}   is a charge density external (logically, not spatially) to the medium.  The mobile charges not only establish    Φ   (  𝐫  )       normal-Φ  𝐫    \Phi(\mathbf{r})   but also move in response to the associated Coulomb force ,    -     q  j     ∇  Φ    (  𝐫  )           subscript  q  j    normal-∇  normal-Φ   𝐫     -q_{j}\,\nabla\Phi(\mathbf{r})   . If we further assume the system to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with a heat bath at absolute temperature    T   T   T   , then the concentrations of discrete charges,     n  j    (  𝐫  )        subscript  n  j   𝐫    n_{j}(\mathbf{r})   , may be considered to be thermodynamic (ensemble) averages and the associated electric potential to be a thermodynamic mean field . With these assumptions, the concentration of the   j   j   j   -th charge species is described by the Boltzmann distribution ,        n  j    (  𝐫  )    =     n  j  0     exp   (   -      q  j    Φ   (  𝐫  )      k  B   T     )            subscript  n  j   𝐫      superscript   subscript  n  j   0            subscript  q  j   normal-Φ  𝐫      subscript  k  B   T         n_{j}(\mathbf{r})=n_{j}^{0}\,\exp\left(-\frac{q_{j}\,\Phi(\mathbf{r})}{k_{B}T}\right)   ,  where    k  B     subscript  k  B    k_{B}   is Boltzmann's constant and where    n  j  0     superscript   subscript  n  j   0    n_{j}^{0}   is the mean concentration of charges of species   j   j   j   .  Identifying the instantaneous concentrations and potential in the Poisson equation with their mean-field counterparts in Boltzmann's distribution yields the Poisson–Boltzmann equation :       ε    ∇  2   Φ    (  𝐫  )    =    -    ∑   j  =  1   N     q  j     n  j  0     exp   (   -      q  j    Φ   (  𝐫  )      k  B   T     )       -    ρ  E    (  𝐫  )           ε    superscript  normal-∇  2   normal-Φ   𝐫         superscript   subscript     j  1    N      subscript  q  j    superscript   subscript  n  j   0            subscript  q  j   normal-Φ  𝐫      subscript  k  B   T            subscript  ρ  E   𝐫      \varepsilon\nabla^{2}\Phi(\mathbf{r})=-\,\sum_{j=1}^{N}q_{j}n_{j}^{0}\,\exp%
 \left(-\frac{q_{j}\,\Phi(\mathbf{r})}{k_{B}T}\right)-\rho_{E}(\mathbf{r})   .  Solutions to this nonlinear equation are known for some simple systems. Solutions for more general systems may be obtained in the high-temperature (weak coupling) limit,       q  j    Φ   (  𝐫  )    ≪    k  B   T      much-less-than     subscript  q  j   normal-Φ  𝐫      subscript  k  B   T     q_{j}\,\Phi(\mathbf{r})\ll k_{B}T   , by Taylor expanding the exponential:       exp   (   -      q  j    Φ   (  𝐫  )      k  B   T     )    ≈   1  -      q  j    Φ   (  𝐫  )      k  B   T                  subscript  q  j   normal-Φ  𝐫      subscript  k  B   T        1       subscript  q  j   normal-Φ  𝐫      subscript  k  B   T       \exp\left(-\frac{q_{j}\,\Phi(\mathbf{r})}{k_{B}T}\right)\approx 1-\frac{q_{j}%
 \,\Phi(\mathbf{r})}{k_{B}T}   .  This approximation yields the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation       ε    ∇  2   Φ    (  𝐫  )    =     (    ∑   j  =  1   N       n  j  0     q  j  2      k  B   T     )   Φ   (  𝐫  )    -    ∑   j  =  1   N     n  j  0    q  j     -    ρ  E    (  𝐫  )           ε    superscript  normal-∇  2   normal-Φ   𝐫         superscript   subscript     j  1    N        superscript   subscript  n  j   0    superscript   subscript  q  j   2       subscript  k  B   T     normal-Φ  𝐫     superscript   subscript     j  1    N      superscript   subscript  n  j   0    subscript  q  j        subscript  ρ  E   𝐫      \varepsilon\nabla^{2}\Phi(\mathbf{r})=\left(\sum_{j=1}^{N}\frac{n_{j}^{0}\,q_{%

 E}(\mathbf{r})   which also is known as the Debye–Hückel equation : 1 2 3 4 5 The second term on the right-hand side vanishes for systems that are electrically neutral. The term in parentheses, divided by   ε   ε   \varepsilon   , has the units of an inverse length squared and by dimensional analysis leads to the definition of the characteristic length scale       λ  D   =    (     ε    k  B   T     ∑   j  =  1   N      n  j  0     q  j  2      )    1  /  2         subscript  λ  D    superscript      ε   subscript  k  B   T     superscript   subscript     j  1    N      superscript   subscript  n  j   0    superscript   subscript  q  j   2        1  2      \lambda_{D}=\left(\frac{\varepsilon\,k_{B}T}{\sum_{j=1}^{N}n_{j}^{0}\,q_{j}^{2%
 }}\right)^{1/2}     that commonly is referred to as the Debye–Hückel length. As the only characteristic length scale in the Debye–Hückel equation,    λ  D     subscript  λ  D    \lambda_{D}   sets the scale for variations in the potential and in the concentrations of charged species. All charged species contribute to the Debye–Hückel length in the same way, regardless of the sign of their charges. For an electrically neutral system, the Poisson equation becomes         ∇  2   Φ    (  𝐫  )    =     λ  D   -  2    Φ   (  𝐫  )    -     ρ  E    (  𝐫  )    ε            superscript  normal-∇  2   normal-Φ   𝐫        superscript   subscript  λ  D     2    normal-Φ  𝐫        subscript  ρ  E   𝐫   ε      \nabla^{2}\Phi(\mathbf{r})=\lambda_{D}^{-2}\Phi(\mathbf{r})-\frac{\rho_{E}(%
 \mathbf{r})}{\varepsilon}   To illustrate Debye screening, the potential produced by an external point charge     ρ  E   =   Q  δ   (  𝐫  )         subscript  ρ  E     Q  δ  𝐫     \rho_{E}=Q\delta(\mathbf{r})   is       Φ   (  𝐫  )    =    Q   4  π  ε  r     e   -   r  /   λ  D             normal-Φ  𝐫       Q    4  π  ε  r     superscript  e      r   subscript  λ  D         \Phi(\mathbf{r})=\frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon r}e^{-r/\lambda_{D}}   The bare Coulomb potential is exponentially screened by the medium, over a distance of the Debye length.  The Debye–Hückel length may be expressed in terms of the Bjerrum length     λ  B     subscript  λ  B    \lambda_{B}   as       λ  D   =    (   4   π     λ  B      ∑   j  =  1   N      n  j  0     z  j  2      )    -   1  /  2          subscript  λ  D    superscript    4  π   subscript  λ  B     superscript   subscript     j  1    N      superscript   subscript  n  j   0    superscript   subscript  z  j   2          1  2       \lambda_{D}=\left(4\pi\,\lambda_{B}\,\sum_{j=1}^{N}n_{j}^{0}\,z_{j}^{2}\right)%

Typical values  In space plasmas where the electron density is relatively low, the Debye length may reach macroscopic values, such as in the magnetosphere, solar wind, interstellar medium and intergalactic medium (see table):      Plasma   Density    Electron temperature    Magnetic field    Debye length        Solar core   10 32   10 7   --   10 −11     Tokamak   10 20   10 8   10   10 −4     Gas discharge   10 16   10 4   --   10 −4     Ionosphere   10 12   10 3   10 −5   10 −3     Magnetosphere   10 7   10 7   10 −8   10 2     Solar wind   10 6   10 5   10 −9   10     Interstellar medium   10 5   10 4   10 −10   10     Intergalactic medium   1   10 6   --   10 5     Source: Chapter 19: The Particle Kinetics of Plasma  http://www.pma.caltech.edu/Courses/ph136/yr2004/     Hannes Alfvén pointed out that: "In a low density plasma, localized space charge regions may build up large potential drops over distances of the order of some tens of the Debye lengths. Such regions have been called electric double layers . An electric double layer is the simplest space charge distribution that gives a potential drop in the layer and a vanishing electric field on each side of the layer. In the laboratory, double layers have been studied for half a century, but their importance in cosmic plasmas has not been generally recognized."  Debye length in a plasma  In a plasma, the background medium may be treated as the vacuum (     ε  r   =  1       subscript  ε  r   1    \varepsilon_{r}=1   ), and the Debye length is       λ  D   =       ε  0    k  B    /   q  e  2       n  e   /   T  e    +    ∑  j      z  j  2    n  j    /   T  j             subscript  λ  D            subscript  ε  0    subscript  k  B     superscript   subscript  q  e   2         subscript  n  e    subscript  T  e      subscript   j        superscript   subscript  z  j   2    subscript  n  j     subscript  T  j          \lambda_{D}=\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_{0}k_{B}/q_{e}^{2}}{n_{e}/T_{e}+\sum_{j}z_%
 {j}^{2}n_{j}/T_{j}}}     where   λ D is the Debye length,  ε 0 is the permittivity of free space ,  k B is the Boltzmann constant ,  q e is the charge of an electron ,  T e and T i are the temperatures of the electrons and ions, respectively,  n e is the density of electrons,  n j is the density of atomic species j , with positive ionic charge z j q e    The ion term is often dropped, giving       λ  D   =      ε  0    k  B    T  e      n  e    q  e  2           subscript  λ  D          subscript  ε  0    subscript  k  B    subscript  T  e       subscript  n  e    superscript   subscript  q  e   2        \lambda_{D}=\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_{0}k_{B}T_{e}}{n_{e}q_{e}^{2}}}     although this is only valid when the mobility of ions is negligible compared to the process's timescale. 6  Debye length in an electrolyte  In an electrolyte or a colloidal suspension , the Debye length 7 for a monovalent electrolyte is usually denoted with symbol κ −1       κ   -  1    =      ε  r    ε  0    k  B   T    2   N  A    e  2   I          superscript  κ    1           subscript  ε  r    subscript  ε  0    subscript  k  B   T     2   subscript  N  A    superscript  e  2   I       \kappa^{-1}=\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_{r}\varepsilon_{0}k_{B}T}{2N_{A}e^{2}I}}     where   I is the ionic strength of the electrolyte, and here the unit should be mole/m 3 ,  ε 0 is the permittivity of free space ,  ε r is the dielectric constant ,  k B is the Boltzmann constant ,  T is the absolute temperature in kelvins ,  N A is the Avogadro number .  e is the elementary charge ,   or, for a symmetric monovalent electrolyte,       κ   -  1    =      ε  r    ε  0   R  T    2   F  2    C  0           superscript  κ    1           subscript  ε  r    subscript  ε  0   R  T     2   superscript  F  2    subscript  C  0        \kappa^{-1}=\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_{r}\varepsilon_{0}RT}{2F^{2}C_{0}}}     where   R is the gas constant ,  F is the Faraday constant ,  C 0 is the molar concentration of the electrolyte.   Alternatively,       κ   -  1    =   1    8  π   λ  B    N  A   I          superscript  κ    1      1      8  π   subscript  λ  B    subscript  N  A   I       \kappa^{-1}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{8\pi\lambda_{B}N_{A}I}}     where      λ  B     subscript  λ  B    \lambda_{B}   is the Bjerrum length of the medium. For water at room temperature, λ B ≈ 0.7 nm.  At room temperature (25 °C), one can consider in water for 1:1 electrolytes the relation: 8        κ   -  1     (  nm  )    =   0.304    I   (  M  )             superscript  κ    1    nm     0.304      I  normal-M       \kappa^{-1}(\mathrm{nm})=\frac{0.304}{\sqrt{I(\mathrm{M})}}     where   κ −1 is expressed in nanometers (nm)  I is the ionic strength expressed in molar (M or mol/L)   Debye length in semiconductors  The Debye length has become increasingly significant in the modeling of solid state devices as improvements in lithographic technologies have enabled smaller geometries. 9 10 11  The Debye length of semiconductors is given:       L  D   =     ε   k  B   T     q  2    N  d           subscript  L  D         ε   subscript  k  B   T      superscript  q  2    subscript  N  d        \mathit{L}_{D}=\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon k_{B}T}{q^{2}N_{d}}}     where   ε is the dielectric constant,  k B is the Boltzmann's constant,  T is the absolute temperature in kelvins,  q is the elementary charge, and  N d is the density of dopants (either donors or acceptors).   When doping profiles exceed the Debye length, majority carriers no longer behave according to the distribution of the dopants. Instead, a measure of the profile of the doping gradients provides an “effective” profile that better matches the profile of the majority carrier density.  In the context of solids, the Debye length is also called the Thomas–Fermi screening length .
