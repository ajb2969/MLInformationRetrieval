   Conchospiral      Conchospiral   In mathematics , a conchospiral is a three-dimensional spiral . In cylindrical coordinates , it is described by the parametric equations:      r  =    μ  t   a       r     superscript  μ  t   a     r=\mu^{t}a         θ  =  t      θ  t    \theta=t          z  =    μ  t   c    .      z     superscript  μ  t   c     z=\mu^{t}c.   The projection of a conchospiral on the ( r , θ)-plane is a logarithmic spiral .  External links     "  Category:Spirals
