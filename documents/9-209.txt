   Clifford bundle      Clifford bundle   In mathematics , a Clifford bundle is an algebra bundle whose fibers have the structure of a Clifford algebra and whose local trivializations respect the algebra structure. There is a natural Clifford bundle associated to any ( pseudo ) Riemannian manifold  M which is called the Clifford bundle of M .  General construction  Let V be a ( real or complex ) vector space together with a symmetric bilinear form . The Clifford algebra  Cℓ ( V ) is a natural ( unital  associative ) algebra generated by V subject only to the relation       v  2   =   -   ⟨  v  ,  v  ⟩         superscript  v  2      v  v      v^{2}=-\langle v,v\rangle   for all v in V . 1 One can construct Cℓ ( V ) as a quotient of the tensor algebra of V by the ideal generated by the above relation.  Like other tensor operations, this construction can be carried out fiberwise on a smooth vector bundle . Let E be a smooth vector bundle over a smooth manifold  M , and let g be a smooth symmetric bilinear form on E . The Clifford bundle of E is the fiber bundle whose fibers are the Clifford algebras generated by the fibers of E :       C  ℓ   (  E  )    =    ∐   x  ∈  M     C  ℓ   (   E  x   ,   g  x   )           C  normal-ℓ  E     subscript  coproduct    x  M      C  normal-ℓ    subscript  E  x    subscript  g  x        C\ell(E)=\coprod_{x\in M}C\ell(E_{x},g_{x})   The topology of Cℓ ( E ) is determined by that of E via an associated bundle construction.  One is most often interested in the case where g is positive-definite or at least nondegenerate ; that is, when ( E , g ) is a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian vector bundle. For concreteness, suppose that ( E , g ) is a Riemannian vector bundle. The Clifford bundle of E can be constructed as follows. Let Cℓ n R be the Clifford algebra generated by R n with the Euclidean metric . The standard action of the orthogonal group O( n ) on R n induces a graded automorphism of Cℓ n R . The homomorphism      ρ  :    O   (  n  )    →   Aut   (   C   ℓ  n   ℝ   )        normal-:  ρ   normal-→    normal-O  n     Aut    C   subscript  normal-ℓ  n   ℝ       \rho:\mathrm{O}(n)\to\mathrm{Aut}(C\ell_{n}\mathbb{R})   is determined by       ρ   (  A  )    (    v  1    v  2   ⋯   v  k    )    =    (   A   v  1    )    (   A   v  2    )   ⋯   (   A   v  k    )          ρ  A     subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2   normal-⋯   subscript  v  k         A   subscript  v  1      A   subscript  v  2    normal-⋯    A   subscript  v  k       \rho(A)(v_{1}v_{2}\cdots v_{k})=(Av_{1})(Av_{2})\cdots(Av_{k})   where v i are all vectors in R n . The Clifford bundle of E is then given by       C  ℓ   (  E  )    =     F   (  E  )     ×  ρ   C    ℓ  n   ℝ         C  normal-ℓ  E       subscript   ρ     F  E   C    subscript  normal-ℓ  n   ℝ     C\ell(E)=F(E)\times_{\rho}C\ell_{n}\mathbb{R}   where F ( E ) is the orthonormal frame bundle of E . It is clear from this construction that the structure group of Cℓ ( E ) is O( n ). Since O( n ) acts by graded automorphisms on Cℓ n R it follows that Cℓ ( E ) is a bundle of Z 2 -graded algebras over M . The Clifford bundle Cℓ ( E ) can then be decomposed into even and odd subbundles:        C  ℓ   (  E  )    =    C   ℓ  0    (  E  )    ⊕   C   ℓ  1    (  E  )      .        C  normal-ℓ  E    direct-sum    C   superscript  normal-ℓ  0   E     C   superscript  normal-ℓ  1   E      C\ell(E)=C\ell^{0}(E)\oplus C\ell^{1}(E).     If the vector bundle E is orientable then one can reduce the structure group of Cℓ ( E ) from O( n ) to SO( n ) in the natural manner.  Clifford bundle of a Riemannian manifold  If M is a Riemannian manifold with metric  g , then the Clifford bundle of M is the Clifford bundle generated by the tangent bundle  TM . One can also build a Clifford bundle out of the cotangent bundle  T * M . The metric induces a natural isomorphism  TM = T * M and therefore an isomorphism Cℓ ( TM ) = Cℓ ( T * M ).  There is a natural vector bundle isomorphism between the Clifford bundle of M and the exterior bundle of M :        C  ℓ   (    T  *   M   )    ≅   Λ   (    T  *   M   )     .        C  normal-ℓ     superscript  T    M      normal-Λ     superscript  T    M      C\ell(T^{*}M)\cong\Lambda(T^{*}M).   This is an isomorphism of vector bundles not algebra bundles. The isomorphism is induced from the corresponding isomorphism on each fiber. In this way one can think of sections of the Clifford bundle as differential forms on M equipped with Clifford multiplication rather than the wedge product (which is independent of the metric).  The above isomorphism respects the grading in the sense that      C   ℓ  0    (    T  *   M   )       C   superscript  normal-ℓ  0      superscript  T    M     \displaystyle C\ell^{0}(T^{*}M)     See also   Orthonormal frame bundle  Spinor  Spin manifold  Spinor representation  Spin geometry  Spin structure  Clifford module bundle   Notes    References      "  Category:Clifford algebras  Category:Vector bundles  Category:Riemannian geometry     There is an arbitrary choice of sign in the definition of a Clifford algebra. In general, one can take v 2 = ±. In differential geometry, it is common to use the (−) sign convention. ↩
