<h1>Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve</strong> is a <a href="United_States_National_Monument" title="wikilink">National Monument</a> and <a href="National_Preserve" title="wikilink">Preserve</a> in the northern <a href="Siskiyou_Mountains" title="wikilink">Siskiyou Mountains</a> of southwestern <a class="uri" href="Oregon" title="wikilink">Oregon</a> in the United States. The main part of the  park, including the <a class="uri" href="marble" title="wikilink">marble</a> cave and a visitor center, is located  east of <a href="Cave_Junction,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Cave Junction</a>, on <a href="Oregon_Route_46" title="wikilink">Oregon Route 46</a>. A separate visitor center in Cave Junction occupies  of the total. Both parts of the monument, managed by the <a href="National_Park_Service" title="wikilink">National Park Service</a>, are in southwestern <a href="Josephine_County,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Josephine County</a>, near the Oregon–<a class="uri" href="California" title="wikilink">California</a> border. The climate is generally mild even at the cave's elevation of about  above sea level, but icicles can form at the cave entrance, and winter snow sometimes blocks the park highway.</p>

<p>Elijah Davidson, a resident of nearby <a href="Williams,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Williams</a>, discovered the cave in 1874. Over the next two decades, private investors failed in efforts to run successful tourist ventures at the publicly owned site. After passage of the <a href="Antiquities_Act" title="wikilink">Antiquities Act</a> by the <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">United States Congress</a>, President <a href="William_Howard_Taft" title="wikilink">William Howard Taft</a> established Oregon Caves National Monument, to be managed by the <a href="United_States_Forest_Service" title="wikilink">United States Forest Service</a>, in 1909. The popularity of the automobile, construction of paved highways, and promotion of tourism by boosters from <a href="Grants_Pass,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Grants Pass</a> led to large increases in cave visitation during the late 1920s and thereafter. Among the attractions at the remote monument is the <a href="Oregon_Caves_Chateau" title="wikilink">Oregon Caves Chateau</a>, a six-story hotel built in a rustic style in 1934. It is a <a href="National_Historic_Landmark" title="wikilink">National Historic Landmark</a> and is part of the <a href="Oregon_Caves_Historic_District" title="wikilink">Oregon Caves Historic District</a> within the monument. The Park Service, which assumed control of the monument in 1933, offers tours of the cave from mid-April through early November. In 2014, the monument was expanded by about  and re-designated a National Monument and Preserve. In addition, the River Styx, which flows through the cave and emerges as Cave Creek, was named to the <a href="National_Wild_and_Scenic_Rivers_System" title="wikilink">National Wild and Scenic Rivers System</a>.</p>

<p>Oregon Caves is a <a href="solutional_cave" title="wikilink">solutional cave</a>, with passages totaling about , that formed in marble. The <a href="parent_rock" title="wikilink">parent rock</a> was originally limestone that <a href="metamorphosis_(geology)" title="wikilink">metamorphosed</a> to marble during the geologic processes that created the <a href="Klamath_Mountains" title="wikilink">Klamath Mountains</a>, including the Siskiyous. Although the limestone formed about 190 million years ago, the cave itself is no older than a few million years. Valued as a tourist cave, the cavern also has scientific value; sections of the cave that are not on tour routes contain <a class="uri" href="fossils" title="wikilink">fossils</a> of national importance.</p>

<p>In addition to cave touring, activities at the park include hiking, photography, and wildlife viewing. One of the park trails leads through the forest to Big Tree, which at  is the thickest <a class="uri" href="Douglas-fir" title="wikilink">Douglas-fir</a> known in Oregon. Lodging and food are available at The Chateau and in Cave Junction. Camping is available at Forest Service campgrounds and private sites in the area.</p>
<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>

<p>Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve is in the <a href="Siskiyou_Mountains" title="wikilink">Siskiyou Mountains</a>, a coastal range that is part of the <a href="Klamath_Mountains" title="wikilink">Klamath Mountains</a> of northwestern <a class="uri" href="California" title="wikilink">California</a> and southwestern Oregon. The main part of the park originally consisted of <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> in the <a href="Rogue_River_–_Siskiyou_National_Forest" title="wikilink">Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest</a>, about  north of the Oregon–California border in <a href="Josephine_County,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Josephine County, Oregon</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> An additional visitor center occupies  in the city of Cave Junction.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The city is in the <a href="Illinois_River_(Oregon)" title="wikilink">Illinois River</a> valley, about  east of the Pacific Ocean.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Elevations within the main part of the monument range from ; the visitor center in Cave Junction is  above sea level.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>In December 2014, the U.S. Congress enlarged the protected area that includes the cave and changed its name to Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This means that two distinct contiguous units of the <a href="List_of_the_United_States_National_Park_System_official_units" title="wikilink">national park system</a> share the Oregon Caves name. The preserve covers ,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and both it and the monument are administered by the same staff.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>By highway, Oregon Caves is  southwest of <a href="Grants_Pass,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Grants Pass</a>,  south of <a href="Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Portland</a> and  north of <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The caves are  east of Cave Junction via <a href="Oregon_Route_46" title="wikilink">Oregon Route 46</a>, which intersects <a href="U.S._Route_199" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 199</a> at Cave Junction.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Despite the monument's name, the main cave is a single system<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> with known passages totaling about  in length.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Eight separate smaller caves have also been discovered in the monument.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>Runoff from the heavily wooded monument forms small <a href="River_source" title="wikilink">headwater</a> streams of the Illinois River, a major tributary of the <a href="Rogue_River_(Oregon)" title="wikilink">Rogue River</a>. One of five small <a href="Spring_(hydrosphere)" title="wikilink">springs</a> in the monument becomes Upper Cave Creek, which flows on the surface before disappearing into its bed and entering the cave. Supplemented by water entering the cave from above, the stream emerges from the main entrance as Cave Creek.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Within the cave, Cave Creek is known as the <em>River Styx</em>. In late 2014, as part of other changes to the protected area and its name, Congress added the River Styx to the <a href="National_Wild_and_Scenic_Rivers_System" title="wikilink">National Wild and Scenic Rivers System</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> It is the only subterranean river in the Wild Rivers system.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p> <a href="Archeologist" title="wikilink">Archeologists</a> believe the first humans to inhabit the Rogue River region were nomadic hunters and gatherers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> <a href="Radiocarbon_dating" title="wikilink">Radiocarbon dating</a> suggests that they arrived in southwestern Oregon at least 8,500 years ago.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> At least 1,500 years before the first contact with whites, the natives established permanent villages along streams.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Even so, no evidence has been found to suggest that any of the native peoples, such as the <a class="uri" href="Takelma" title="wikilink">Takelma</a> who lived along the Rogue and <a href="Applegate_River" title="wikilink">Applegate</a> rivers in the 19th century, used the cave.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>Largely bypassed by the early non-native explorers, fur traders, and settlers because of its remote location, the region attracted newcomers in quantity when prospectors found gold near <a href="Jacksonville,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Jacksonville</a> in the Rogue River valley in 1851.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> This led to the creation of <a href="Jackson_County,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Jackson County</a> in 1852 and, after gold discoveries near <a href="Waldo,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Waldo</a> in the Illinois River valley, to the creation of Josephine County, named for the daughter of a gold miner.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Even with an influx of miners and of settlers who farmed <a href="Donation_Land_Claim_Act" title="wikilink">donation land claims</a>, Josephine County's population was only 1,204 in 1870.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>Elijah Jones Davidson, who discovered the cave in 1874, emigrated from Illinois to Oregon with his parents, who eventually settled along Williams Creek in Josephine County.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> <a href="Williams,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Williams</a>, as the community came to be called, is about  northeast of the cave.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>Only a few people visited the cave during the next decade. Among them was <a href="Thomas_Condon" title="wikilink">Thomas Condon</a>, professor of geology at the University of Oregon. Guided by Davidson's brother, in 1884 he and a group of students hiked from Williams to the cavern, which they inspected by candlelight.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Shortly thereafter, Walter Burch, an acquaintance of the Davidson family, tried to develop the cave as a business.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Burch and his partners opened what they called Limestone Caves and charged visitors $1 each for a guided cave trip, a camping spot, pasture for horses, and cave water they described as medicinal.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Although Burch and others hacked crude trails to the cave from Cave Junction and Williams, the trip was too difficult for most tourists, and Limestone Caves ceased operations in 1888.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p> In the early 1890s, the Oregon Caves Improvement Company, headed by Alfonso B. Smith of <a href="San_Diego" title="wikilink">San Diego</a> and two men from <a href="Kerby,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Kerby, Oregon</a>, tried to raise capital for a larger tourist business at Oregon Caves.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Smith made outlandish claims about the cave and its business potential, saying that it was  long, that an ordinary <a href="horse_and_buggy" title="wikilink">horse and buggy</a> could be driven through  of it, that it had 600 separate chambers, and that the company planned to build something like a <a href="tram" title="wikilink">streetcar</a> line from Williams to the cave.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Smith succeeded in wooing <em><a href="The_San_Francisco_Examiner" title="wikilink">The San Francisco Examiner</a></em>, which twice sent reporters to the site. The second occasion involved a cave expedition that lasted about 10 days and involved "an orgy of destruction"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> in which passages were widened, formations broken or deliberately removed, and directional arrows added to the cave walls.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> After Smith had spent all of the company's money and borrowed more in its name, he disappeared in 1894, and the business collapsed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>Neither Burch nor Smith had owned the cave or the land around it, which belonged to the public.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Beginning in the 1890s, the Federal government began regulating the use of public lands like these.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In 1903, President <a href="Theodore_Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Theodore Roosevelt</a> designated millions of acres of forest lands for protection, including what became Siskiyou National Forest, which surrounds the cave. The <a href="United_States_Forest_Service" title="wikilink">United States Forest Service</a> was created in 1905 to manage these reserves. Three years later, <a href="U.S._Congress" title="wikilink">Congress</a> passed the <a href="Antiquities_Act" title="wikilink">Antiquities Act</a>, which allowed the President to designate protected areas called National Monuments on public lands. In 1909, President <a href="William_Howard_Taft" title="wikilink">William Howard Taft</a> established Oregon Caves National Monument, to be managed by the Forest Service. A year later the Forest Service employed men to guard the cave and to serve as tour guides.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>Isolated and difficult to reach, the monument attracted only 1,800 visitors in 1920.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The situation changed markedly when large numbers of Americans began to travel by automobile on roads paid for largely with government funds. One highway connected <a href="Grants_Pass,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Grants Pass</a> with the California coast at <a href="Crescent_City,_California" title="wikilink">Crescent City</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Another new road, the Oregon Caves Highway, led from the Grants Pass – Crescent City highway to the cave.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Campaigns to attract car-driving tourists included those of the Cavemen, a booster group from Grants Pass that dressed in animal skins, posed along tour routes, and staged annual events to promote the monument.<mtpl>{{#tag:ref|In 1931, the Cavemen dedicated Caveman Bridge over the Rogue River in Grants Pass. The bridge marks the northern end of the Redwood Highway (U.S. Route 199), which connects Grants Pass with Cave Junction and the Oregon Caves Highway. <a href="Grants_Pass_High_School" title="wikilink">Grants Pass High School</a> uses "Cavemen" as its mascot name.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a>|group=n}}</mtpl> By 1928, the number of visitors to the cave had risen to about 24,000 a year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p> The visitors' need for overnight lodging led to creation of public and private campsites and rustic cabins along highways near Cave Junction and the monument.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> In 1923, the Forest Service signed a contract with the Oregon Caves Company, based in Grants Pass, to run the cave tours and improve the park accommodations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The Chalet, a building with a kitchen, dining room, gift shop, ticket sales area, and a dormitory for women on the Oregon Caves Company staff, was completed later that year. Three years later, the company added seven two-bedroom cabins for tourists and a dormitory for male employees.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> In 1928, an Oregon Caves bill written by the Forest Service and introduced by Senator <a href="Charles_L._McNary" title="wikilink">Charles McNary</a> of Oregon won Congressional approval.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> It provided funds for electric lights, a power plant, a formation-washing system, and an artificial exit tunnel to eliminate the crowding that occurred when two groups on round-trip tours had to pass one another in the cave. The  tunnel was completed in 1931.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p>Management of the monument was transferred from the Forest Service to the National Park Service in 1933, and a six-story hotel, the <a href="Oregon_Caves_Chateau" title="wikilink">Oregon Caves Chateau</a>, was completed at the site in 1934.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Gust Lium, a builder from Grants Pass, oversaw construction of the Chateau and some of the park's other buildings, which he designed in a <a href="National_Park_Service_Rustic" title="wikilink">rustic style</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Mason Manufacturing of <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> produced the Chateau's furniture in a style called <a href="Monterey_Furniture" title="wikilink"><em>Monterey</em></a>, valued in the 21st century at up to $5,000 for a single chair.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> During the 1930s and early 1940s, the <a href="Civilian_Conservation_Corps" title="wikilink">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> (CCC) installed water and telephone lines, improved trails, and worked on landscaping at the park.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The Chalet was rebuilt in 1942 to include a third story and a larger dormitory for women.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>

<p> Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve is open year-round, although snow sometimes blocks the road to the park. Cave tours are offered from mid-spring (mid-April) to late fall (early November), and the visitor center is open when the cave is open for tours. The schedule varies from season to season, but tours generally start no earlier than 9 a.m. and no later than 6 p.m. except for candlelight tours offered on Fridays and Saturdays at 6:30 p.m. between late May and early September.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn112" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>

<p>Cave-tour tickets are available only at the monument and are sold on a first-come, first-served basis.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn113" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> Tours are  long and last 90 minutes, although visitors can choose to leave the cave about halfway through the tour.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn114" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> The route requires negotiating more than 500 steep and uneven stairs and passageways with as little as  between floor and ceiling.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn115" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Not recommended by the Park Service for anyone with heart, lung, or mobility problems, the tour involves a total climb of .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn116" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> Children less than  tall or who are unable to climb a set of test stairs on their own are not allowed on the full cave tour.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn117" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> The Park Service offers a limited number of off-trail "Introduction to Caving" tours by advanced reservation only.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn118" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>

<p>Since the cave is only  inside regardless of the outdoor temperature, the Park Service recommends warm clothing for its tours. Good walking shoes are needed to negotiate slippery and uneven surfaces. Not allowed on the tours are flashlights, backpacks, large purses, tripods, or pets. To protect bats from <a href="white_nose_syndrome" title="wikilink">white nose syndrome</a>, visitors must not take any clothing or equipment into Oregon Caves that entered any cave in Europe or any cave, mine, or bat hibernation site east of the <a href="Rocky_Mountains" title="wikilink">Rocky Mountains</a> in North America after 2005.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn119" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
