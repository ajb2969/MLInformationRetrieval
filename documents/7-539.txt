   Minimum total potential energy principle      Minimum total potential energy principle   The minimum total potential energy principle is a fundamental concept used in physics , chemistry , biology , and engineering . It asserts that a structure or body shall deform or displace to a position that minimizes the total potential energy, with the lost potential energy being dissipated as heat. For example, a marble placed in a bowl will move to the bottom and rest there, and similarly, a tree branch laden with snow will bend to a lower position. The lower position is the position for minimum potential energy: it is the stable configuration for equilibrium. The principle has many applications in structural analysis and solid mechanics .  A binding energy is the energy that must be exported from a system for the system to enter a bound state . If the potential energy is chosen to be zero when the system is unbound, the potential energy of the system is negative after it enters a bound state. 1 A bound system has a lower ( i.e. , more negative) potential energy than the sum of its parts—this is what keeps the system aggregated in accordance with the minimum total potential energy principle .  Some examples   A free proton and free electron will tend to combine to form the lowest energy state (the ground state ) of a hydrogen atom , the most stable configuration . This is because that state's energy is 13.6 electron volts (eV) lower than when the two particles separated by an infinite  distance . The dissipation in this system takes the form of spontaneous emission of electromagnetic radiation , which increases the entropy of the surroundings.    A rolling ball will end up stationary at the bottom of a hill, the point of minimum potential energy. The reason is that as it rolls downward under the influence of gravity , friction produced by its motion transfers energy in the form of heat of the surroundings with an attendant increase in entropy.    A protein folds into the state of lowest potential energy . In this case, the dissipation takes the form of vibration of atoms within or adjacent to the protein.   Structural Mechanics  The total potential energy,   𝚷   𝚷   \boldsymbol{\Pi}   , is the sum of the elastic strain energy, U , stored in the deformed body and the potential energy, V , associated to the applied forces:      𝚷  =    𝐔  +  𝐕    (  1  )        𝚷     𝐔  𝐕   1     \boldsymbol{\Pi}=\mathbf{U}+\mathbf{V}\qquad\mathrm{(1)}   This energy is at a stationary position when an infinitesimal variation from such position involves no change in energy:        δ  𝚷   =   δ   (   𝐔  +  𝐕   )    =  0    (  2  )      formulae-sequence        δ  𝚷     δ    𝐔  𝐕         0    2    \delta\boldsymbol{\Pi}=\delta(\mathbf{U}+\mathbf{V})=0\qquad\mathrm{(2)}     The principle of minimum total potential energy may be derived as a special case of the virtual work principle for elastic systems subject to conservative forces .  The equality between external and internal virtual work (due to virtual displacements) is:         ∫   S  t      δ    𝐮  T   𝐓  d  S    +    ∫  V     δ    𝐮  T   𝐟  d  V     =     ∫  V    δ   ϵ  T   𝝈  d  V     (  3  )            subscript    subscript  S  t      δ   superscript  𝐮  T   𝐓  d  S      subscript   V     δ   superscript  𝐮  T   𝐟  d  V        subscript   V     δ   superscript  bold-italic-ϵ  T   𝝈  d  V    3     \int_{S_{t}}\delta\ \mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{T}dS+\int_{V}\delta\ \mathbf{u}^{T}%

In addition, when the external forces are conservative forces , the left-hand-side of (3) can be seen as the change in the potential energy function V of the forces. The function V is defined as:      𝐕  =    -    ∫   S  t      𝐮  T   𝐓  d  S     -    ∫  V     𝐮  T   𝐟  d  V         𝐕        subscript    subscript  S  t       superscript  𝐮  T   𝐓  d  S       subscript   V      superscript  𝐮  T   𝐟  d  V       \mathbf{V}=-\int_{S_{t}}\mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{T}dS-\int_{V}\mathbf{u}^{T}%
 \mathbf{f}dV     where the minus sign implies a loss of potential energy as the force is displaced in its direction. With these two subsidiary conditions, (3) becomes:       -    δ   𝐕    =    δ   𝐔           δ  𝐕      δ  𝐔     -\delta\ \mathbf{V}=\delta\ \mathbf{U}   This leads to (2) as desired. The variational form of (2) is often used as the basis for developing the finite element method in structural mechanics .
