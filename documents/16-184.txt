   Capsanthin/capsorubin synthase      Capsanthin/capsorubin synthase   Capsanthin/capsorubin synthase (, CCS , ketoxanthophyll synthase , capsanthin-capsorubin synthase ) is an enzyme with system name violaxanthin—capsorubin isomerase (ketone-forming) . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) violaxanthin    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    capsorubin   (2) antheraxanthin    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    capsanthin    This multifunctional enzyme is induced during chromoplast differentiation in plants.
