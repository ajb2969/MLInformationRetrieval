Capsanthin/capsorubin synthase

Capsanthin/capsorubin synthase (, CCS, ketoxanthophyll synthase, capsanthin-capsorubin synthase) is an enzyme with system name violaxanthin—capsorubin isomerase (ketone-forming).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) violaxanthin

capsorubin

(2) antheraxanthin

capsanthin


This multifunctional enzyme is induced during chromoplast differentiation in plants.
