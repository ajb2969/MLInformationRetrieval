Dimethylhistidine N-methyltransferase




Dimethylhistidine N-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a dimethylhistidine N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + Nalpha,Nalpha-dimethyl-L-histidine 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + Nalpha,Nalpha,Nalpha-trimethyl-L-histidine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and Nalpha,Nalpha-dimethyl-L-histidine, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and Nalpha,Nalpha,Nalpha-trimethyl-L-histidine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:Nalpha,Nalpha-dimethyl-L-histidine Nalpha-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include dimethylhistidine methyltransferase, histidine-alpha-N-methyltransferase, S-adenosyl-L-methionine:alpha-N,alpha-N-dimethyl-L-histidine, and alpha-N-methyltransferase.
