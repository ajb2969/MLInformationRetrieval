Trigonometric substitution

In mathematics, Trigonometric substitution is the substitution of trigonometric functions for other expressions. One may use the trigonometric identities to simplify certain integrals containing radical expressions:12

Substitution 1. If the integrand contains a2 − x2, let


 
  and use the identity





Substitution 2. If the integrand contains a2 + x2, let


 
  and use the identity





Substitution 3. If the integrand contains x2 − a2, let


 
  and use the identity




Examples
Integrals containing a2 − x2
In the integral



we may use






Note that the above step requires that a > 0 and cos(θ) > 0; we can choose the a to be the positive square root of a2; and we impose the restriction on θ to be −π/2 \int_0^{\frac{a}{2}}\frac{\mathrm dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}=\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{6}} \mathrm d\theta = \tfrac{\pi}{6}.
Some care is needed when picking the bounds. The integration above requires that −π/2 2 + x2=== In the integral



we may write



so that the integral becomes



(provided a ≠ 0).
Integrals containing x2 − a2
Integrals like



should be done by partial fractions rather than trigonometric substitutions. However, the integral



can be done by substitution:






We can then solve this using the formula for the integral of secant cubed.
Substitutions that eliminate trigonometric functions
Substitution can be used to remove trigonometric functions. In particular, see Tangent half-angle substitution.
For instance,



Hyperbolic substitution
Substitutions of hyperbolic functions can also be used to simplify integrals.3
