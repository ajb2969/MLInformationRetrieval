   Mole fraction      Mole fraction   In chemistry , the mole fraction or molar fraction (    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   ) is defined as the amount of a constituent (expressed in moles ),    n  i     subscript  n  i    n_{i}   , divided by the total amount of all constituents in a mixture,    n   t  o  t      subscript  n    t  o  t     n_{tot}   : 1       x  i   =    n  i    n   t  o  t          subscript  x  i      subscript  n  i    subscript  n    t  o  t       x_{i}=\frac{n_{i}}{n_{tot}}     The sum of all the mole fractions is equal to 1:         ∑   i  =  1   N    n  i    =   n   t  o  t     ;     ∑   i  =  1   N    x  i    =  1      formulae-sequence      superscript   subscript     i  1    N    subscript  n  i     subscript  n    t  o  t         superscript   subscript     i  1    N    subscript  x  i    1     \sum_{i=1}^{N}n_{i}=n_{tot};\;\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}=1     The same concept expressed with a denominator of 100 is the mole percent or molar percentage or molar proportion ( mol% ).  The mole fraction is also called the amount fraction . 2 It is identical to the number fraction , which is defined as the number of molecules of a constituent    N  i     subscript  N  i    N_{i}   divided by the total number of all molecules    N   t  o  t      subscript  N    t  o  t     N_{tot}   . The mole fraction is sometimes denoted by the lowercase Greek letter    χ   χ   \chi    ( chi ) instead of a Roman    x   x   x   . 3 4 For mixtures of gases, IUPAC recommends the letter   y   y   y   . 5  The National Institute of Standards and Technology of the United States prefers the term amount-of-substance fraction over mole fraction because it does not contain the name of the unit mole. 6  Whereas mole fraction is a ratio of moles to moles, molar concentration is a ratio of moles to volume.  The mole fraction is one way of expressing the composition of a mixture with a dimensionless quantity ; mass fraction (percentage by weight, wt%) and volume fraction ( percentage by volume , vol%) are others.  Properties  Mole fraction is used very frequently in the construction of phase diagrams . It has a number of advantages:   it is not temperature dependent (such as molar concentration ) and does not require knowledge of the densities of the phase(s) involved  a mixture of known mole fraction can be prepared by weighing off the appropriate masses of the constituents  the measure is symmetric : in the mole fractions x=0.1 and x=0.9, the roles of 'solvent' and 'solute' are reversed.  In a mixture of ideal gases , the mole fraction can be expressed as the ratio of partial pressure to total pressure of the mixture   Related quantities  Mass fraction  The mass fraction     w  i     subscript  w  i    w_{i}   can be calculated using the formula       w  i   =    x  i   ⋅    M  i   M         subscript  w  i    normal-⋅   subscript  x  i      subscript  M  i   M      w_{i}=x_{i}\cdot\frac{M_{i}}{M}     where    M  i     subscript  M  i    M_{i}   is the molar mass of the component   i   i   i   and   M   M   M   is the average molar mass of the mixture.  Replacing the expression of the molar mass:       w  i   =    x  i   ⋅    M  i     ∑  i     x  i    M  i            subscript  w  i    normal-⋅   subscript  x  i      subscript  M  i     subscript   i      subscript  x  i    subscript  M  i         w_{i}=x_{i}\cdot\frac{M_{i}}{\sum_{i}x_{i}M_{i}}     Mole percentage  Multiplying mole fraction by 100 gives the mole percentage, also referred as amount/amount percent (abbreviated as n/n%).  Mass concentration  The conversion to and from mass concentration     ρ  i     subscript  ρ  i    \rho_{i}   is given by:       x  i   =     ρ  i   ρ   ⋅   M   M  i          subscript  x  i    normal-⋅     subscript  ρ  i   ρ     M   subscript  M  i       x_{i}=\frac{\rho_{i}}{\rho}\cdot\frac{M}{M_{i}}     where   M   M   M   is the average molar mass of the mixture.       ρ  i   =     x  i   ρ   ⋅    M  i   M         subscript  ρ  i    normal-⋅     subscript  x  i   ρ      subscript  M  i   M      \rho_{i}=x_{i}\rho\cdot\frac{M_{i}}{M}     Molar concentration  The conversion to molar concentration     c  i     subscript  c  i    c_{i}   is given by:       c  i   =     x  i   ⋅  ρ   M   =    x  i   c          subscript  c  i      normal-⋅   subscript  x  i   ρ   M           subscript  x  i   c      c_{i}=\frac{{x_{i}\cdot\rho}}{{M}}=x_{i}c     or       c  i   =     x  i   ⋅  ρ     ∑  i     x  i    M  i           subscript  c  i      normal-⋅   subscript  x  i   ρ     subscript   i      subscript  x  i    subscript  M  i        c_{i}=\frac{{x_{i}\cdot\rho}}{{\sum_{i}x_{i}M_{i}}}     where   M   M   M   is the average molar mass of the solution, c total molar concentration and   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the density of the solution .  Mass and molar mass  The mole fraction can be calculated from the masses     m  i     subscript  m  i    m_{i}   and molar masses     M  i     subscript  M  i    M_{i}   of the components:       x  i   =     |   m  i    |   M  i      ∑  i    |   m  i    |   M  i          subscript  x  i      fragments    normal-|   subscript  m  i    normal-|   subscript  M  i     fragments   subscript   i     normal-|   subscript  m  i    normal-|   subscript  M  i       x_{i}=\frac{{\frac{|}{{m_{i}}}|{{M_{i}}}}}{{\sum_{i}\frac{|}{{m_{i}}}|{{M_{i}}%
