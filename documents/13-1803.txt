Mean signed deviation

In statistics, the mean signed difference, deviation, or error (MSD or MSE) is a sample statistic that summarises how well an estimator

 
  matches the quantity 
 
 
 
  that it is supposed to estimate. It is one of a number of statistics that can be used to assess an estimation procedure, and it would often be used in conjunction with a sample version of the mean square error.
Definition
The mean signed difference is derived from a set of n pairs, 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  is an estimate of the parameter 
 
 
 
  in a case where it is known that 
 
 
 
 . In many applications, all the quantities 
 
 
 
  will share a common value. When applied to forecasting in a time series analysis context, a forecasting procedure might be evaluated using the mean signed difference, with 
 
 
 
  being the predicted value of a series at a given lead time and 
 
 
 
 
  being the value of the series eventually observed for that time-point. The mean signed difference is defined to be
