   Mean signed deviation      Mean signed deviation   In statistics , the mean signed difference , deviation , or error ( MSD or MSE ) is a sample statistic that summarises how well an estimator     θ  ^     normal-^  θ    \hat{\theta}   matches the quantity   θ   θ   \theta   that it is supposed to estimate. It is one of a number of statistics that can be used to assess an estimation procedure, and it would often be used in conjunction with a sample version of the mean square error .  Definition  The mean signed difference is derived from a set of n pairs,    (    θ  ^   i   ,   θ  i   )      subscript   normal-^  θ   i    subscript  θ  i     (\hat{\theta}_{i},\theta_{i})   , where     θ  ^   i     subscript   normal-^  θ   i    \hat{\theta}_{i}   is an estimate of the parameter   θ   θ   \theta   in a case where it is known that    θ  =   θ  i       θ   subscript  θ  i     \theta=\theta_{i}   . In many applications, all the quantities    θ  i     subscript  θ  i    \theta_{i}   will share a common value. When applied to forecasting in a time series analysis context, a forecasting procedure might be evaluated using the mean signed difference, with     θ  ^   i     subscript   normal-^  θ   i    \hat{\theta}_{i}   being the predicted value of a series at a given lead time and    θ  i     subscript  θ  i    \theta_{i}   being the value of the series eventually observed for that time-point. The mean signed difference is defined to be        MSD   (   θ  ^   )    =    ∑   i  =  1   n       θ  i   ^   -   θ  i    n     .

 i}}{n}.     See also   Deviation (statistics)  Mean absolute difference  Mean absolute error   "  Category:Summary statistics  Category:Means  Category:Statistical terminology
