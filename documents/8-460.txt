   Intersection theorem      Intersection theorem   In projective geometry , an intersection theorem or incidence theorem is a statement concerning an incidence structure – consisting of points, lines, and possibly higher-dimensional objects and their incidences – together with a pair of objects $A$ and $B$ (for instance, a point and a line). The " theorem " states that, whenever a set of objects satisfies the incidences ( i.e. can be identified with the objects of the incidence structure in such a way that incidence is preserved), then the objects $A$ and $B$ must also be incident. An intersection theorem is not necessarily true in all projective geometries; it is a property that some geometries satisfy but others don't.  For example, Desargues' theorem can be stated using the following incidence structure:   Points $$\{A,B,C,a,b,c,P,Q,R,O\}$$  Lines $$\{AB,AC,BC,ab,ac,bc,Aa,Bb,Cc,PQ\}$$  Incidences (in addition to obvious ones such as $(A,AB)$ ) $$\{(O,Aa),(O,Bb),(O,Cc),(P,BC),(P,bc),(Q,AC),(Q,ac),(R,AB),(R,ab)\}$$   The implication is then $(R,PQ)$ —that point $R$ is incident with line $$ .  Famous examples  Desargues' theorem holds in a projective plane $P$  if and only if  $P$ is the projective plane over some division ring (skewfield} $D$ — $P=\mathbb{P}_{2}D$ . The projective plane is then called desarguesian . A theorem of Amitsur and Bergman states that, in the context of desarguesian projective planes, for every intersection theorem there is a rational identity such that the plane $P$ satisfies the intersection theorem if and only if the division ring $D$ satisfies the rational identity.   Pappus's hexagon theorem holds in a desarguesian projective plane $\mathbb{P}_{2}D$ if and only if $D$ is a field ; it corresponds to the identity $\forall a,b\in D, \quad a\cdot b=b\cdot a$ .  Fano's axiom (which states a certain intersection does not happen) holds in $\mathbb{P}_{2}D$ if and only if $D$ has characteristic  $\neq 2$ ; it corresponds to the identity $ a + a = 0$ .
