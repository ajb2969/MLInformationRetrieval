Phosphatidylcholine—sterol O-acyltransferase




Phosphatidylcholine—sterol O-acyltransferase

In enzymology, a phosphatidylcholine---sterol O-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

phosphatidylcholine + a sterol 
 
 
 
  1-acylglycerophosphocholine + a sterol ester
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phosphatidylcholine and sterol, whereas its two products are 1-acylglycerophosphocholine and sterol ester.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphatidylcholine:sterol O-acyltransferase. Other names in common use include lecithin---cholesterol acyltransferase, phospholipid---cholesterol acyltransferase, LCAT (lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase), lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, and lysolecithin acyltransferase. This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism.
