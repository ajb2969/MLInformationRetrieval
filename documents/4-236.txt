   Graph homomorphism      Graph homomorphism   In the mathematical field of graph theory a graph homomorphism is a mapping between two graphs that respects their structure. More concretely it maps adjacent vertices to adjacent vertices.  Definitions  A graph homomorphism    f   f   f   from a graph    G  =   (  V  ,  E  )       G   V  E     G=(V,E)   to a graph     G  ′   =   (   V  ′   ,   E  ′   )        superscript  G  normal-′     superscript  V  normal-′    superscript  E  normal-′      G^{\prime}=(V^{\prime},E^{\prime})   , written    f  :   G  →   G  ′       normal-:  f   normal-→  G   superscript  G  normal-′      f:G\rightarrow G^{\prime}   , is a mapping    f  :   V  →   V  ′       normal-:  f   normal-→  V   superscript  V  normal-′      f:V\rightarrow V^{\prime}   from the vertex set of   G   G   G   to the vertex set of    G  ′     superscript  G  normal-′    G^{\prime}   such that     {  u  ,  v  }   ∈  E       u  v   E    \{u,v\}\in E   implies     {   f   (  u  )    ,   f   (  v  )    }   ∈   E  ′          f  u     f  v     superscript  E  normal-′     \{f(u),f(v)\}\in E^{\prime}   .  The above definition is extended to directed graphs. Then, for a homomorphism    f  :   G  →   G  ′       normal-:  f   normal-→  G   superscript  G  normal-′      f:G\rightarrow G^{\prime}   ,    (   f   (  u  )    ,   f   (  v  )    )       f  u     f  v     (f(u),f(v))   is an arc of    G  ′     superscript  G  normal-′    G^{\prime}   if    (  u  ,  v  )     u  v    (u,v)   is an arc of   G   G   G   .  If there exists a homomorphism    f  :   G  →  H      normal-:  f   normal-→  G  H     f:G\rightarrow H   we shall write    G  →  H     normal-→  G  H    G\rightarrow H   , and    G  ↛  H     ↛  G  H    G\not\rightarrow H   otherwise. If    G  →  H     normal-→  G  H    G\rightarrow H   ,   G   G   G   is said to be homomorphic to   H   H   H   or    H   H   H   -colourable .  If the homomorphism    f  :   G  →   G  ′       normal-:  f   normal-→  G   superscript  G  normal-′      f:G\rightarrow G^{\prime}   is a bijection whose inverse function is also a graph homomorphism, then   f   f   f   is a graph isomorphism .  Two graphs   G   G   G   and    G  ′     superscript  G  normal-′    G^{\prime}   are homomorphically equivalent if    G  →   G  ′      normal-→  G   superscript  G  normal-′     G\rightarrow G^{\prime}   and     G  ′   →  G     normal-→   superscript  G  normal-′   G    G^{\prime}\rightarrow G   .  A retract of a graph   G   G   G   is a subgraph    H   H   H   of   G   G   G   such that there exists a homomorphism    r  :   G  →  H      normal-:  r   normal-→  G  H     r:G\rightarrow H   , called retraction with     r   (  x  )    =  x        r  x   x    r(x)=x   for any vertex   x   x   x   of   H   H   H   . A core is a graph which does not retract to a proper subgraph. Any graph is homomorphically equivalent to a unique core.  Properties  The composition of homomorphisms are homomorphisms.  Graph homomorphism preserves connectedness .  The tensor product of graphs is the category-theoretic product for the category of graphs and graph homomorphisms.  Connection to coloring and girth  A graph coloring is an assignment of one of k colors to each vertex of a graph G so that the endpoints of each edge have different colors, for some number k . Any coloring corresponds to a homomorphism    f  :   G  →   K  k       normal-:  f   normal-→  G   subscript  K  k      f:G\rightarrow K_{k}   from G to a complete graph  K k : the vertices of K k correspond to the colors of G , and f maps each vertex of G with color c to the vertex of K k that corresponds to c . This is a valid homomorphism because the endpoints of each edge of G are mapped to distinct vertices of K k , and every two distinct vertices of K k are connected by an edge, so every edge in G is mapped to an adjacent pair of vertices in K k . Conversely if f is a homomorphism from G to K k , then one can color G by using the same color for two vertices in G whenever they are both mapped to the same vertex in K k . Because K k has no edges that connect a vertex to itself, it is not possible for two adjacent vertices in G to both be mapped to the same vertex in K k , so this gives a valid coloring. That is, G has a k -coloring if and only if it has a homomorphism to K k .  If there are two homomorphisms    H  →  G  →   K  k        normal-→  H  G    normal-→     subscript  K  k      H\rightarrow G\rightarrow K_{k}   , then their composition    H  →   K  k      normal-→  H   subscript  K  k     H\rightarrow K_{k}   is also a homomorphism. In other words, if a graph G can be colored with k colors, and there is a homomorphism    H  →  G     normal-→  H  G    H\rightarrow G   , then H can also be k -colored. Therefore, whenever a homomorphism    H  →  G     normal-→  H  G    H\rightarrow G   exists, the chromatic number of H is less than or equal to the chromatic number of G .  Homomorphisms can also be used very similarly to characterize the odd girth of a graph G , the length of its shortest odd-length cycle. The odd girth is, equivalently, the smallest odd number  g for which there exists a homomorphism     C  g   →  G     normal-→   subscript  C  g   G    C_{g}\rightarrow G   . For this reason, if    G  →  H     normal-→  G  H    G\rightarrow H   , then the odd girth of G is greater than or equal to the corresponding invariant of H . 1  Complexity  The associated decision problem , i.e. deciding whether there exists a homomorphism from one graph to another, is NP-complete . Determining whether there is an isomorphism between two graphs is also an important problem in computational complexity theory; see graph isomorphism problem .  See also   Hadwiger's conjecture .
