5-epiaristolochene 1,3-dihydroxylase

5-epiaristolochene 1,3-dihydroxylase (, 5-epi-aristolochene 1,3-dihydroxylase, EAH) is an enzyme with system name 5-epiaristolochene,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (1- and 3-hydroxylating).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

5-epiaristolochene + 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + 2 O2 $\rightleftharpoons$ capsidiol + 2 NADP+ + 2 H2O
 

5-epiaristolochene 1,3-dihydroxylase is a heme-thiolate protein (P-450).
