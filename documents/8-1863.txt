   Fuzzy subalgebra      Fuzzy subalgebra   Fuzzy subalgebras theory is a chapter of fuzzy set theory . It is obtained from an interpretation in a multi-valued logic of axioms usually expressing the notion of subalgebra of a given algebraic structure .  Definition  Consider a first order language for algebraic structures with a monadic predicate symbol S. Then a fuzzy subalgebra is a fuzzy model of a theory containing, for any n -ary operation h, the axioms      ∀   x  1   ,  …  ,  ∀   x  n    (  S   (   x  1   )   and  …  .  .  and  S   (   x  n   )   →  S   (  h   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )   )       fragments  for-all   subscript  x  1   normal-,  normal-…  normal-,  for-all   subscript  x  n    fragments  normal-(  S   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  1   normal-)   and  normal-…  normal-.  normal-.  and  S   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  n   normal-)   normal-→  S   fragments  normal-(  h   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  1   normal-,  normal-…  normal-,   subscript  x  n   normal-)   normal-)      \forall x_{1},...,\forall x_{n}(S(x_{1})\and.....\and S(x_{n})\rightarrow S(h(%
 x_{1},...,x_{n}))     and, for any constant c, S(c).  The first axiom expresses the closure of S with respect to the operation h, and the second expresses the fact that c is an element in S. As an example, assume that the valuation structure is defined in [0,1] and denote by   ⊙   direct-product   \odot   the operation in [0,1] used to interpret the conjunction. Then a fuzzy subalgebra of an algebraic structure whose domain is D is defined by a fuzzy subset  of D such that, for every d 1 ,...,d n in D, if h is the interpretation of the n-ary operation symbol h, then          s   (   d  1   )    ⊙  …  ⊙  s    (   d  n   )    ≤   s   (   𝕙   (   d  1   ,  …  ,   d  n   )    )           direct-product    s   subscript  d  1    normal-…  s    subscript  d  n      s    𝕙    subscript  d  1   normal-…   subscript  d  n        s(d_{1})\odot...\odot s(d_{n})\leq s(\mathbb{h}(d_{1},...,d_{n}))      Moreover, if c is the interpretation of a constant c such that s( c ) = 1.  A largely studied class of fuzzy subalgebras is the one in which the operation   ⊙   direct-product   \odot   coincides with the minimum. In such a case it is immediate to prove the following proposition.  Proposition. A fuzzy subset s of an algebraic structure defines a fuzzy subalgebra if and only if for every λ in [0,1], the closed cut {x ∈ D : s(x)≥ λ} of s is a subalgebra.  Fuzzy subgroups and submonoids  The fuzzy subgroups and the fuzzy submonoids are particularly interesting classes of fuzzy subalgebras. In such a case a fuzzy subset s of a monoid (M,•, u ) is a fuzzy submonoid if and only if        s   (  𝕦  )    =  1        s  𝕦   1    s(\mathbb{u})=1            s   (  x  )    ⊙  s    (  y  )    ≤   s   (   x  ⋅  y   )           direct-product    s  x   s   y     s   normal-⋅  x  y      s(x)\odot s(y)\leq s(x\cdot y)      where u is the neutral element in A.  Given a group G, a fuzzy subgroup of G is a fuzzy submonoid s of G such that   s(x) ≤ s(x −1 ).   It is possible to prove that the notion of fuzzy subgroup is strictly related with the notions of fuzzy equivalence . In fact, assume that S is a set, G a group of transformations in S and (G,s) a fuzzy subgroup of G. Then, by setting   e(x,y) = Sup{s(h) : h is an element in G such that h(x) = y}   we obtain a fuzzy equivalence. Conversely, let e be a fuzzy equivalence in S and, for every transformation h of S, set   s(h)= Inf{e(x,h(x)): x∈S}.   Then s defines a fuzzy sub group of transformation in S. In a similar way we can relate the fuzzy submonoids with the fuzzy orders.
