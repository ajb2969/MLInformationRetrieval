   Pyranose dehydrogenase (acceptor)      Pyranose dehydrogenase (acceptor)   Pyranose dehydrogenase (acceptor) (, pyranose dehydrogenase , pyranose-quinone oxidoreductase , quinone-dependent pyranose dehydrogenase , PDH ) is an enzyme with system name pyranose:acceptor oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 4 5 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) a pyranose + acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a pyranos-2-ulose (or a pyranos-3-ulose or a pyranos-2,3-diulose) + reduced acceptor  (2) a pyranoside + acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a pyranosid-3-ulose (or a pyranosid-3,4-diulose) + reduced acceptor   This enzyme requires FAD. A number of aldoses and ketoses in pyranose form, as well as glycosides , gluco-oligosaccharides, sucrose and lactose can act as a donor.
