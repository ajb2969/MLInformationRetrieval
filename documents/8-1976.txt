   Tree-graded space      Tree-graded space   A geodesic  metric space    X   X   X   is called tree-graded space , with respect to a collection of connected proper subsets called pieces , if any two distinct pieces intersect by at most one point, and every non-trivial simple geodesic triangle of   X   X   X   is contained in one of the pieces.  Thus, for pieces of bounded diameter , tree-graded spaces behave like real trees in their coarse geometry (in the sense of Gromov ) while allowing non-tree-like behavior within the pieces.  Tree-graded spaces were introduced by  in their study of the asymptotic cones of hyperbolic groups .  References    .   "  Category:Metric geometry  Category:Trees (topology)
