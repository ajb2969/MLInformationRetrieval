Additive model

In statistics, an additive model (AM) is a nonparametric regression method. It was suggested by Jerome H. Friedman and Werner Stuetzle (1981)1 and is an essential part of the ACE algorithm. The AM uses a one-dimensional smoother to build a restricted class of nonparametric regression models. Because of this, it is less affected by the curse of dimensionality than e.g. a p-dimensional smoother. Furthermore, the AM is more flexible than a standard linear model, while being more interpretable than a general regression surface at the cost of approximation errors. Problems with AM include model selection, overfitting, and multicollinearity.
Description
Given a data set 
 
 
 
  of n statistical units, where 
 
 
 
  represent predictors and 
 
 
 
  is the outcome, the additive model takes the form

  Where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The functions 
 
 
 
  are unknown smooth functions fit from the data. Fitting the AM (i.e. the functions 
 
 
 
 ) can be done using the backfitting algorithm proposed by Andreas Buja, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani (1989).2
