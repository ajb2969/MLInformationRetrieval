   Fourier number      Fourier number   In physics and engineering , the Fourier number ( Fo ) or Fourier modulus , named after Joseph Fourier , is a dimensionless number that characterizes heat conduction. Together with the Biot number , it characterizes transient conduction problems. Conceptually, it is the ratio of diffusive / conductive transport rate by the quantity storage rate and arises from non-dimensionalization of the heat equation . The transported quantity is usually either heat or matter (particles).  The general Fourier number is defined as:       F  o   =   diffusive transport rate  storage rate         F  o     diffusive transport rate  storage rate     Fo=\dfrac{\mbox{diffusive transport rate}}{\mbox{storage rate}}     The thermal Fourier number is defined by the conduction rate to the rate of thermal energy storage.

The Fourier number is frequently used as a nondimensional time parameter. If the Biot number is less than 0.1, then the entire system can be treated at uniform temperature. The following equation derived from the Biot and Fourier numbers can be used to find the time, where T 0 is the initial temperature and T is the temperature of the object at time t .      t  =     ρ   c  p   V    h  A     ln     T  0   -   T  ∞     T  -   T  ∞           t        ρ   subscript  c  p   V     h  A           subscript  T  0    subscript  T       T   subscript  T          t=\frac{\rho{{c}_{p}}V}{hA}\ln\frac{{{T}_{0}}-{{T}_{\infty}}}{T-{{T}_{\infty}}}     References     See also   Biot number  Convection  Heat conduction  Heat equation  Molecular diffusion  Residence time   "  Category:Dimensionless numbers of thermodynamics
