Mutation (algebra)

In the theory of algebras over a field, mutation is a construction of a new binary operation related to the multiplication of the algebra. In specific cases the resulting algebra may be referred to as a homotope or an isotope of the original.
Definitions
Let A be an algebra over a field F with multiplication (not assumed to be associative) denoted by juxtaposition. For an element a of A, define the left a-homotope

 
  to be the algebra with multiplication



Similarly define the left (a,b) mutation





Right homotope and mutation are defined analogously. Since the right (p,q) mutation of A is the left (−q, −p) mutation of the opposite algebra to A, it suffices to study left mutations.1
If A is a unital algebra and a is invertible, we refer to the isotope by a.
Properties

If A is associative then so is any homotope of A, and any mutation of A is Lie-admissible.
If A is alternative then so is any homotope of A, and any mutation of A is Malcev-admissible.2
Any isotope of a Hurwitz algebra is isomorphic to the original.3
A homotope of a Bernstein algebra by an element of non-zero weight is again a Bernstein algebra.4

Jordan algebras
A Jordan algebra is a commutative algebra satisfying the Jordan identity

 
 . The Jordan triple product is defined by



For y in A the mutation5 or homotope6 Ay is defined as the vector space A with multiplication



and if y is invertible this is referred to as an isotope. A homotope of a Jordan algebra is again a Jordan algebra: isotopy defines an equivalence relation.7 If y is nuclear then the isotope by y is isomorphic to the original.8
