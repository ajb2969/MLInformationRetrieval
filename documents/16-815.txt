   Mutation (algebra)      Mutation (algebra)   In the theory of algebras over a field , mutation is a construction of a new binary operation related to the multiplication of the algebra. In specific cases the resulting algebra may be referred to as a homotope or an isotope of the original.  Definitions  Let A be an algebra over a field  F with multiplication (not assumed to be associative ) denoted by juxtaposition. For an element a of A , define the left a -homotope     A   (  a  )       A  a    A(a)   to be the algebra with multiplication        x  *  y   =    (   x  a   )   y    .        x  y       x  a   y     x*y=(xa)y.\,     Similarly define the left ( a , b ) mutation     A   (  a  ,  b  )       A   a  b     A(a,b)           x  *  y   =     (   x  a   )   y   -    (   y  b   )   x     .        x  y         x  a   y       y  b   x      x*y=(xa)y-(yb)x.\,     Right homotope and mutation are defined analogously. Since the right ( p , q ) mutation of A is the left (− q , − p ) mutation of the opposite algebra to A , it suffices to study left mutations. 1  If A is a unital algebra and a is invertible, we refer to the isotope by a .  Properties   If A is associative then so is any homotope of A , and any mutation of A is Lie-admissible .  If A is alternative then so is any homotope of A , and any mutation of A is Malcev-admissible . 2  Any isotope of a Hurwitz algebra is isomorphic to the original. 3  A homotope of a Bernstein algebra by an element of non-zero weight is again a Bernstein algebra. 4   Jordan algebras  A Jordan algebra is a commutative algebra satisfying the Jordan identity       (   x  y   )    (   x  x   )    =   x   (   y   (   x  x   )    )            x  y     x  x      x    y    x  x       (xy)(xx)=x(y(xx))   . The Jordan triple product is defined by        {  a  ,  b  ,  c  }   =      (   a  b   )   c   +    (   c  b   )   a    -    (   a  c   )   b     .       a  b  c           a  b   c       c  b   a        a  c   b      \{a,b,c\}=(ab)c+(cb)a-(ac)b.\,     For y in A the mutation 5 or homotope 6  A y is defined as the vector space A with multiplication        a  ∘  b   =   {  a  ,  y  ,  b  }    .        a  b    a  y  b     a\circ b=\{a,y,b\}.\,     and if y is invertible this is referred to as an isotope . A homotope of a Jordan algebra is again a Jordan algebra: isotopy defines an equivalence relation. 7 If y is nuclear then the isotope by y is isomorphic to the original. 8  References         "  Category:Non-associative algebras     Elduque & Myung (1994) p. 34 ↩    ↩  Koecher (1999) p. 76 ↩  McCrimmon (2004) p. 86 ↩  McCrimmon (2004) p. 71 ↩  McCrimmon (2004) p. 72 ↩
