   Glycosylphosphatidylinositol diacylglycerol-lyase      Glycosylphosphatidylinositol diacylglycerol-lyase   In enzymology , a glycosylphosphatidylinositol diacylglycerol-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   6-(alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   6-(alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1D-myo-inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate + 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 6-(alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol , and two products , 6-(alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1D-myo-inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate and 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the class of phosphorus-oxygen lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-(alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol-lyase [6-(alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1D-myo-inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate-forming] . Other names in common use include (glycosyl)phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C , GPI-PLC , GPI-specific phospholipase C , VSG-lipase , glycosyl inositol phospholipid anchor-hydrolyzing enzyme , glycosylphosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C , glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C , variant-surface-glycoprotein phospholipase C , 6-(alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol , and diacylglycerol-lyase (1,2-cyclic-phosphate-forming) .
