   Lie coalgebra      Lie coalgebra   In mathematics a Lie coalgebra is the dual structure to a Lie algebra .  In finite dimensions, these are dual objects: the dual vector space to a Lie algebra naturally has the structure of a Lie coalgebra, and conversely.  Definition  Let E be a vector space over a field  k equipped with a linear mapping    d  :   E  →   E  ∧  E       normal-:  d   normal-→  E    E  E      d\colon E\to E\wedge E   from E to the exterior product of E with itself. It is possible to extend d uniquely to a graded derivation (this means that, for any a , b ∈ E which are homogeneous elements ,     d   (   a  ∧  b   )    =      (   d  a   )   ∧  b   +     (   -  1   )    deg  a    a    ∧   (   d  b   )          d    a  b            d  a   b      superscript    1    deg  a    a      d  b      d(a\wedge b)=(da)\wedge b+(-1)^{\operatorname{deg}a}a\wedge(db)   ) of degree 1 on the exterior algebra of E :       d  :     ⋀  ∙   E   →    ⋀    ∙   +  1     E     .     normal-:  d   normal-→    superscript   normal-∙   E     superscript    normal-∙  absent    1     E      d\colon\bigwedge^{\bullet}E\rightarrow\bigwedge^{\bullet+1}E.   Then the pair ( E , d ) is said to be a Lie coalgebra if d 2 = 0, i.e., if the graded components of the exterior algebra with derivation    (    ⋀  *   E   ,  d  )       superscript     E   d    (\bigwedge^{*}E,d)   form a cochain complex :       E     →   d      E  ∧   E      →   d       ⋀  3   E     →   d     …        superscript  normal-→  d   E    E  E      superscript  normal-→  d       superscript   3   E      superscript  normal-→  d     normal-…     E\ \rightarrow^{\!\!\!\!\!\!d}\ E\wedge E\ \rightarrow^{\!\!\!\!\!\!d}\ %
 \bigwedge^{3}E\rightarrow^{\!\!\!\!\!\!d}\ \dots     Relation to de Rham complex  Just as the exterior algebra (and tensor algebra) of vector fields on a manifold form a Lie algebra (over the base field K ), the de Rham complex of differential forms on a manifold form a Lie coalgebra (over the base field K ). Further, there is a pairing between vector fields and differential forms.  However, the situation is subtler: the Lie bracket is not linear over the algebra of smooth functions     C  ∞    (  M  )        superscript  C    M    C^{\infty}(M)   (the error is the Lie derivative ), nor is the exterior derivative      d   (   f  g   )    =     (   d  f   )   g   +   f   (   d  g   )     ≠   f   (   d  g   )            d    f  g          d  f   g     f    d  g            f    d  g       d(fg)=(df)g+f(dg)\neq f(dg)   (it is a derivation, not linear over functions): they are not tensors . They are not linear over functions, but they behave in a consistent way, which is not captured simply by the notion of Lie algebra and Lie coalgebra.  Further, in the de Rham complex, the derivation is not only defined for     Ω  1   →   Ω  2      normal-→   superscript  normal-Ω  1    superscript  normal-Ω  2     \Omega^{1}\to\Omega^{2}   , but is also defined for      C  ∞    (  M  )    →    Ω  1    (  M  )       normal-→     superscript  C    M      superscript  normal-Ω  1   M     C^{\infty}(M)\to\Omega^{1}(M)   .  The Lie algebra on the dual  A Lie algebra structure on a vector space is a map     [  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ]   :    𝔤  ×  𝔤   →  𝔤      normal-:   normal-⋅  normal-⋅    normal-→    𝔤  𝔤   𝔤     [\cdot,\cdot]\colon\mathfrak{g}\times\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{g}   which is skew-symmetric , and satisfies the Jacobi identity. Equivalently, a map     [  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ]   :    𝔤  ∧  𝔤   →  𝔤      normal-:   normal-⋅  normal-⋅    normal-→    𝔤  𝔤   𝔤     [\cdot,\cdot]\colon\mathfrak{g}\wedge\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{g}   that satisfies the Jacobi identity .  Dually, a Lie coalgebra structure on a vector space E is a linear map    d  :   E  →   E  ⊗  E       normal-:  d   normal-→  E   tensor-product  E  E      d\colon E\to E\otimes E   which is antisymmetric (this means that it satisfies     τ  ∘  d   =   -  d         τ  d     d     \tau\circ d=-d   , where   τ   τ   \tau   is the canonical flip     E  ⊗  E   →   E  ⊗  E      normal-→   tensor-product  E  E    tensor-product  E  E     E\otimes E\to E\otimes E   ) and satisfies the so-called cocycle condition (also known as the co-Leibniz rule )        (   d  ⊗  id   )   ∘  d   =     (   id  ⊗  d   )   ∘  d   +    (   id  ⊗  τ   )   ∘   (   d  ⊗  id   )   ∘  d           tensor-product  d  id   d        tensor-product  id  d   d      tensor-product  id  τ    tensor-product  d  id   d      \left(d\otimes\mathrm{id}\right)\circ d=\left(\mathrm{id}\otimes d\right)\circ

 d   .  Due to the antisymmetry condition, the map    d  :   E  →   E  ⊗  E       normal-:  d   normal-→  E   tensor-product  E  E      d\colon E\to E\otimes E   can be also written as a map    d  :   E  →   E  ∧  E       normal-:  d   normal-→  E    E  E      d\colon E\to E\wedge E   .  The dual of the Lie bracket of a Lie algebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   yields a map (the cocommutator)        [  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ]   *   :    𝔤  *   →    (   𝔤  ∧  𝔤   )   *   ≅    𝔤  *   ∧   𝔤  *        normal-:   superscript   normal-⋅  normal-⋅        normal-→   superscript  𝔤     superscript    𝔤  𝔤             superscript  𝔤     superscript  𝔤         [\cdot,\cdot]^{*}\colon\mathfrak{g}^{*}\to(\mathfrak{g}\wedge\mathfrak{g})^{*}%
 \cong\mathfrak{g}^{*}\wedge\mathfrak{g}^{*}   where the isomorphism   ≅     \cong   holds in finite dimension; dually for the dual of Lie comultiplication . In this context, the Jacobi identity corresponds to the cocycle condition.  More explicitly, let E be a Lie coalgebra over a field of characteristic neither 2 nor 3 . The dual space E * carries the structure of a bracket defined by   α([ x , y ]) = d α( x ∧ y ), for all α ∈ E and x , y ∈ E * .   We show that this endows E * with a Lie bracket. It suffices to check the Jacobi identity . For any x , y , z ∈ E * and α ∈ E ,       d  2   α   (   x  ∧  y  ∧  z   )        superscript  d  2   α    x  y  z     \displaystyle d^{2}\alpha(x\wedge y\wedge z)   where the latter step follows from the standard identification of the dual of a wedge product with the wedge product of the duals. Finally, this gives         d  2   α   (   x  ∧  y  ∧  z   )    =    1  3    (    α   (   [   [  x  ,  y  ]   ,  z  ]   )    +   α   (   [   [  y  ,  z  ]   ,  x  ]   )    +   α   (   [   [  z  ,  x  ]   ,  y  ]   )     )     .         superscript  d  2   α    x  y  z        1  3       α    x  y   z      α    y  z   x      α    z  x   y        d^{2}\alpha(x\wedge y\wedge z)=\frac{1}{3}\left(\alpha([[x,y],z])+\alpha([[y,z%
 ],x])+\alpha([[z,x],y])\right).   Since d 2 = 0, it follows that       α   (    [   [  x  ,  y  ]   ,  z  ]   +   [   [  y  ,  z  ]   ,  x  ]   +   [   [  z  ,  x  ]   ,  y  ]    )    =  0        α      x  y   z     y  z   x     z  x   y     0    \alpha([[x,y],z]+[[y,z],x]+[[z,x],y])=0   , for any α, x , y , and z . Thus, by the double-duality isomorphism (more precisely, by the double-duality monomorphism, since the vector space needs not be finite-dimensional), the Jacobi identity is satisfied.  In particular, note that this proof demonstrates that the cocycle condition d 2 = 0 is in a sense dual to the Jacobi identity.  References     "  Category:Coalgebras  Category:Lie algebras
