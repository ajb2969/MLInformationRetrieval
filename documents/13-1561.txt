Regular extension

In field theory, a branch of algebra, a field extension

 
  is said to be regular if k is algebraically closed in L (i.e., 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the set of elements in L algebraic over k) and L is separable over k, or equivalently, 
 
 
 
  is an integral domain when 
 
 
 
 
  is the algebraic closure of 
 
 
 
  (that is, to say, 
 
 
 
  are linearly disjoint over k).12
Properties

Regularity is transitive: if F/E and E/K are regular then so is F/K.3
If F/K is regular then so is E/K for any E between F and K.4
The extension L/k is regular if and only if every subfield of L finitely generated over k is regular over k.5
Any extension of an algebraically closed field is regular.67
An extension is regular if and only if it is separable and primary.8
A purely transcendental extension of a field is regular.

Self-regular extension
There is also a similar notion: a field extension 
 
 
 
  is said to be self-regular if 
 
 
 
  is an integral domain. A self-regular extension is relatively algebraically closed in k.9 However, a self-regular extension is not necessarily regular.
