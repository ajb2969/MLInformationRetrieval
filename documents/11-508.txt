   L-arabinonolactonase      L-arabinonolactonase   In enzymology , a L-arabinonolactonase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-arabinono-1,4-lactone + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-arabinonate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-arabinono-1,4-lactone and H 2 O , whereas its product is L-arabinonate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-arabinono-1,4-lactone lactonohydrolase . This enzyme participates in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
