   Galactosylgalactosylxylosylprotein 3-beta-glucuronosyltransferase      Galactosylgalactosylxylosylprotein 3-beta-glucuronosyltransferase   In enzymology , a galactosylgalactosylxylosylprotein 3-beta-glucuronosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucuronate + 3-beta-D-galactosyl-4-beta-D-galactosyl-O-beta-D-xylosylprotein   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 3-beta-D-glucuronosyl-3-beta-D-galactosyl-4-beta-D-galactosyl-O- beta-D-xylosylprotein   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucuronate and 3-beta-D-galactosyl-4-beta-D-galactosyl-O-beta-D-xylosylprotein , whereas its 3 products are UDP , 3-beta-D-glucuronosyl-3-beta-D-galactosyl-4-beta-D-galactosyl-O- , and beta-D-xylosylprotein .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucuronate:3-beta-D-galactosyl-4-beta-D-galactosyl-O-beta-D-xyl osyl-protein D-glucuronosyltransferase . Other names in common use include glucuronosyltransferase I , and uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid:acceptor glucuronosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis and glycan structures - biosynthesis 1 . It employs one cofactor , manganese .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
