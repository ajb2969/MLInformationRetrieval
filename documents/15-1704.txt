Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase

Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase (, SHIP1, SHIP2, SHIP, p150Ship) is an enzyme with system name 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphohydrolase.12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 3,4-bisphosphate + phosphate


This enzyme hydroylses 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) to produce PtdIns(3,4)P2.
