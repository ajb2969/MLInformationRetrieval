   Biotin—(acetyl-CoA-carboxylase) ligase      Biotin—(acetyl-CoA-carboxylase) ligase   In enzymology , a biotin-[acetyl-CoA-carboxylase] ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + biotin + apo-[acetyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming)]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + [acetyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming)]   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , biotin , and apo-[acetyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming)], whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and acetyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming).  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming generic carbon-nitrogen bonds.  This enzyme participates in biotin metabolism . This protein may use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation . 1  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is biotin:apo-[acetyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming)] ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include:   biotin-[acetyl-CoA carboxylase] synthetase,  biotin-[acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase] synthetase,  acetyl coenzyme A holocarboxylase synthetase,  acetyl CoA holocarboxylase synthetase,  biotin:apocarboxylase ligase,  biotin holoenzyme synthetase,  and HCS.
