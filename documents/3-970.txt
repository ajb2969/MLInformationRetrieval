 In mathematics, theta functions are special functions of several complex variables. They are important in many areas, including the theories of abelian varieties and moduli spaces, and of quadratic forms. They have also been applied to soliton theory. When generalized to a Grassmann algebra, they also appear in quantum field theory.
The most common form of theta function is that occurring in the theory of elliptic functions. With respect to one of the complex variables (conventionally called z), a theta function has a property expressing its behavior with respect to the addition of a period of the associated elliptic functions, making it a quasiperiodic function. In the abstract theory this comes from a line bundle condition of descent.
Jacobi theta function
 
There are several closely related functions called Jacobi theta functions, and many different and incompatible systems of notation for them. One Jacobi theta function (named after Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi) is a function defined for two complex variables z and τ, where z can be any complex number and τ is confined to the upper half-plane, which means it has positive imaginary part. It is given by the formula


 
  where q = exp(πiτ) and η = exp(2πiz). It is a Jacobi form. If τ is fixed, this becomes a Fourier series for a periodic entire function of z with period 1; in this case, the theta function satisfies the identity



The function also behaves very regularly with respect to its quasi-period τ and satisfies the functional equation



where a and b are integers.

Auxiliary functions
The Jacobi theta function defined above is sometimes considered along with three auxiliary theta functions, in which case it is written with a double 0 subscript:


 
  The auxiliary (or half-period) functions are defined by



This notation follows Riemann and Mumford; Jacobi's original formulation was in terms of the nome

 
  rather than τ. In Jacobi's notation the θ-functions are written:



The above definitions of the Jacobi theta functions are by no means unique. See Jacobi theta functions (notational variations) for further discussion.
If we set z = 0 in the above theta functions, we obtain four functions of τ only, defined on the upper half-plane (sometimes called theta constants.) These can be used to define a variety of modular forms, and to parametrize certain curves; in particular, the Jacobi identity is



which is the Fermat curve of degree four.
Jacobi identities
Jacobi's identities describe how theta functions transform under the modular group, which is generated by τ ↦ τ+1 and τ ↦ -1/τ. Equations for the first transform are easily found since adding one to τ in the exponent has the same effect as adding 1/2 to z (n is congruent to n squared modulo 2). For the second, let



Then



Theta functions in terms of the nome
Instead of expressing the Theta functions in terms of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , we may express them in terms of arguments 
 
 
 
  and the nome q, where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  . In this form, the functions become



We see that the Theta functions can also be defined in terms of w and q, without a direct reference to the exponential function. These formulas can, therefore, be used to define the Theta functions over other fields where the exponential function might not be everywhere defined, such as fields of p-adic numbers.
Product representations
The Jacobi triple product tells us that for complex numbers w and q with |q| \prod_{m=1}^\infty \left( 1 - q^{2m}\right) \left( 1 + w^{2}q^{2m-1}\right) \left( 1 + w^{-2}q^{2m-1}\right)
\sum_{n
-\infty}^\infty w^{2n}q^{n^2}. 
It can be proven by elementary means, as for instance in Hardy and Wright's An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers.
If we express the theta function in terms of the nome 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then



We therefore obtain a product formula for the theta function in the form



In terms of w and q:









where 
 
 
 
  is the q-Pochhammer symbol and 
 
 
 
  is the q-theta function. Expanding terms out, the Jacobi triple product can also be written



which we may also write as



This form is valid in general but clearly is of particular interest when z is real. Similar product formulas for the auxiliary theta functions are









Integral representations
The Jacobi theta functions have the following integral representations:

Zeros of the Jacobi theta functions
All zeros of the Jacobi theta functions are simple zeros and are given by the following:











 
  where m,n are arbitrary integers.
Relation to the Riemann zeta function
The relation


 
  was used by Riemann to prove the functional equation for the Riemann zeta function, by means of the integral


 
  which can be shown to be invariant under substitution of s by 1 − s. The corresponding integral for z not zero is given in the article on the Hurwitz zeta function.
Relation to the Weierstrass elliptic function
The theta function was used by Jacobi to construct (in a form adapted to easy calculation) his elliptic functions as the quotients of the above four theta functions, and could have been used by him to construct Weierstrass's elliptic functions also, since



where the second derivative is with respect to z and the constant c is defined so that the Laurent expansion of 
 
 
 
  at z = 0 has zero constant term.
Relation to the q-gamma function
The fourth theta function – and thus the others too – is intimately connected to the Jackson q-gamma function via the relation3



Relations to Dedekind eta function
Let η(τ) be the Dedekind eta function, and the argument of the theta function as the nome

A solution to heat equation
The Jacobi theta function is the fundamental solution of the one-dimensional heat equation with spatially periodic boundary conditions. Taking z = x to be real and τ = it with t real and positive, we can write



which solves the heat equation



This theta-function solution is 1-periodic in x, and as t → 0 it approaches the periodic delta function, or Dirac comb, in the sense of distributions


 
 .
General solutions of the spatially periodic initial value problem for the heat equation may be obtained by convolving the initial data at t = 0 with the theta function.
Relation to the Heisenberg group
The Jacobi theta function is invariant under the action of a discrete subgroup of the Heisenberg group. This invariance is presented in the article on the theta representation of the Heisenberg group.
Generalizations
If F is a quadratic form in n variables, then the theta function associated with F is


 
  with the sum extending over the lattice of integers Zn. This theta function is a modular form of weight n/2 (on an appropriately defined subgroup) of the modular group. In the Fourier expansion,


 
  the numbers RF(k) are called the representation numbers of the form.
Ramanujan theta function
Riemann theta function
Let



be set of symmetric square matrices whose imaginary part is positive definite. Hn is called the Siegel upper half-space and is the multi-dimensional analog of the upper half-plane. The n-dimensional analogue of the modular group is the symplectic group Sp(2n,Z); for n = 1, Sp(2,Z) = SL(2,Z). The n-dimensional analog of the congruence subgroups is played by 
 
 
 
 .
Then, given 
 
 
 
 , the Riemann theta function is defined as



Here, 
 
 
 
  is an n-dimensional complex vector, and the superscript T denotes the transpose. The Jacobi theta function is then a special case, with n = 1 and 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the upper half-plane.
The Riemann theta converges absolutely and uniformly on compact subsets of 
 
 

The functional equation is



which holds for all vectors 
 
 
 
 , and for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Poincaré series
The Poincaré series generalizes the theta series to automorphic forms with respect to arbitrary Fuchsian groups.
