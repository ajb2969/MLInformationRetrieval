   Hartogs–Rosenthal theorem      Hartogs–Rosenthal theorem   In mathematics , the Hartogs–Rosenthal theorem is a classical result in complex analysis on the uniform approximation of continuous functions on compact subsets of the complex plane by rational functions . The theorem was proved in 1931 by the German mathematicians Friedrich Hartogs and Arthur Rosenthal and has been widely applied, particularly in operator theory .  Statement of theorem  The Hartogs–Rosenthal theorem states that if K is a compact subset of the complex plane with Lebesgue measure zero, then any continuous complex-valued function on K can be uniformly approximated by rational functions.  Proof of theorem  By the Stone–Weierstrass theorem any complex-valued continuous function on K can be uniformly approximated by a polynomial in   z   z   z   and    z  ¯     normal-¯  z    \overline{z}   .  So it suffices to show that    z  ¯     normal-¯  z    \overline{z}   can be uniformly approximated by a rational function on K .  Let g(z) be a smooth function of compact support on C equal to 1 on K and set        f   (  z  )    =    g   (  z  )    ⋅   z  ¯     .        f  z    normal-⋅    g  z    normal-¯  z      f(z)=g(z)\cdot\overline{z}.     By the generalized Cauchy integral formula        f   (  z  )    =    1   2  π  i      ∬   C  \  K       ∂  f    ∂   w  ¯        d  w   ∧   d   w  ¯      w  -  z        ,        f  z       1    2  π  i      subscript  double-integral   normal-\  C  K          f      normal-¯  w           d  w     d   normal-¯  w       w  z         f(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\iint_{{C\backslash K}}\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{w}}%
 \frac{dw\wedge d\bar{w}}{w-z},     since K has measure zero.  Restricting z to K and taking Riemann approximating sums for the integral on the right hand side yields the required uniform approximation of    z  ¯     normal-¯  z    \bar{z}   by a rational function. 1  See also   Runge's theorem  Mergelyan's theorem   Notes  References        "  Category:Rational functions  Category:Theorems in approximation theory  Category:Theorems in complex analysis     ↩
