Moving equilibrium theorem

Consider a dynamical system
(1)..........
 
 

(2)..........
 
 

with the state variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 . Assume that 
 
 
 
  is fast and 
 
 
 
  is slow. Assume that the system (1) gives, for any fixed 
 
 
 
 , an asymptotically stable solution 
 
 
 
 . Substituting this for 
 
 
 
 
  in (2) yields
(3)..........
 
 

Here 
 
 
 
  has been replaced by 
 
 
 
  to indicate that the solution 
 
 
 
  to (3) differs from the solution for 
 
 
 
 
  obtainable from the system (1), (2).
The Moving Equilibrium Theorem suggested by  Lotka states that the solutions 
 
 
 
  obtainable from (3) approximate the solutions 
 
 
 
  obtainable from (1), (2) provided the partial system (1) is asymptotically stable in 
 
 
 
  for any given 
 
 
 
  and heavily damped (fast).
The theorem has been proved for linear systems comprising real vectors 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . It permits reducing high-dimensional dynamical problems to lower dimensions and underlies Alfred Marshall's temporary equilibrium method.
