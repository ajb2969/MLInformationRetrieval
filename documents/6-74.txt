   Routh–Hurwitz theorem      Routh–Hurwitz theorem   In mathematics , the Routh–Hurwitz theorem gives a test to determine whether all roots of a given polynomial lie in the left half-plane. Polynomials with this property are called Hurwitz- stable . The Routh–Hurwitz theorem was proved in 1895, and it was named after Edward John Routh and Adolf Hurwitz . It is used in the Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion .  Notations  Let f ( z ) be a polynomial (with complex coefficients) of degree n with no roots on the imaginary line (i.e. the line Z = ic where i is the imaginary unit and c is a real number ). Let us define     P  0    (  y  )        subscript  P  0   y    P_{0}(y)   (a polynomial of degree n ) and     P  1    (  y  )        subscript  P  1   y    P_{1}(y)   (a nonzero polynomial of degree strictly less than n ) by     f   (   i  y   )    =     P  0    (  y  )    +   i   P  1    (  y  )           f    i  y         subscript  P  0   y     i   subscript  P  1   y      f(iy)=P_{0}(y)+iP_{1}(y)   , respectively the real and imaginary parts of f on the imaginary line.  Furthermore, let us denote by:   p the number of roots of f in the left half-plane (taking into account multiplicities);  q the number of roots of f in the right half-plane (taking into account multiplicities);      Δ   arg  f    (   i  y   )       normal-Δ    f     i  y     \Delta\arg f(iy)   the variation of the argument of f ( iy ) when y runs from −∞ to +∞;  ( x ) is the number of variations of the generalized Sturm chain obtained from     P  0    (  y  )        subscript  P  0   y    P_{0}(y)   and     P  1    (  y  )        subscript  P  1   y    P_{1}(y)   by applying the Euclidean algorithm ;       I   -  ∞    +  ∞    r       superscript   subscript  I            r    I_{-\infty}^{+\infty}r   is the Cauchy index of the rational function  r over the real line.   Statement  With the notations introduced above, the Routh–Hurwitz theorem states that:      p  -  q  =   1  π   Δ  arg  f   (  i  y  )   =   {      +    I   -  ∞    +  ∞        P  0    (  y  )      P  1    (  y  )          for odd degree       -    I   -  ∞    +  ∞        P  1    (  y  )      P  0    (  y  )          for even degree      }  =  w  (  +  ∞  )  -  w  (  -  ∞  )  .     fragments  p   q     1  π   Δ   f   fragments  normal-(  i  y  normal-)     cases       superscript   subscript  I                 subscript  P  0   y      subscript  P  1   y      for odd degree       superscript   subscript  I                 subscript  P  1   y      subscript  P  0   y      for even degree   normal-}   w  normal-(    normal-)   w  normal-(    normal-)  normal-.    p-q=\frac{1}{\pi}\Delta\arg f(iy)=\left.\begin{cases}+I_{-\infty}^{+\infty}%
 \frac{P_{0}(y)}{P_{1}(y)}&\text{for odd degree}\\
 -I_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{P_{1}(y)}{P_{0}(y)}&\text{for even degree}\end{%
 cases}\right\}=w(+\infty)-w(-\infty).     From the first equality we can for instance conclude that when the variation of the argument of f ( iy ) is positive, then f ( z ) will have more roots to the left of the imaginary axis than to its right. The equality p − q = w (+∞) − w (−∞) can be viewed as the complex counterpart of Sturm's theorem . Note the differences: in Sturm's theorem, the left member is p + q and the w from the right member is the number of variations of a Sturm chain (while w refers to a generalized Sturm chain in the present theorem).  Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion  We can easily determine a stability criterion using this theorem as it is trivial that f ( z ) is Hurwitz-stable  iff  p − q = n . We thus obtain conditions on the coefficients of f ( z ) by imposing w (+∞) = n and w (−∞) = 0.
