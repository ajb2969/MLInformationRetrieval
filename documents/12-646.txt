   Lee distance      Lee distance   In coding theory , the Lee distance is a distance between two strings      x  1    x  2   …   x  n        subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{1}x_{2}\dots x_{n}   and     y  1    y  2   …   y  n        subscript  y  1    subscript  y  2   normal-…   subscript  y  n     y_{1}y_{2}\dots y_{n}   of equal length n over the q -ary alphabet {0, 1, …, q − 1} of size q ≥ 2. It is a metric , defined as        ∑   i  =  1   n    min   (   |    x  i   -   y  i    |   ,   q  -   |    x  i   -   y  i    |    )     .      superscript   subscript     i  1    n          subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i       q       subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i         \sum_{i=1}^{n}\min(|x_{i}-y_{i}|,q-|x_{i}-y_{i}|).    1  Considering the alphabet as the additive group Z q , the Lee distance between two letters is the length of shortest path in the Cayley graph (which is circular since the group is cyclic) between them. 2  If q = 2 or q = 3 the Lee distance coincides with the Hamming distance .  The metric space induced by the Lee distance is a discrete analog of the elliptic space . 3  Example  If q = 6, then the Lee distance between 3140 and 2543 is 1 + 2 + 0 + 3 = 6.  History and application  The Lee distance is named after C. Y. Lee . It is applied for phase modulation while the Hamming distance is used in case of orthogonal modulation.  The Berlekamp code is an example of code in the Lee metric. 4 Other significant examples are the Preparata code and Kerdock code ; these codes are non-linear when considered over a field, but are linear over a ring . 5  Also, there exists a Gray isometry (bijection preserving weight) between    ℤ  4     subscript  ℤ  4    \mathbb{Z}_{4}   with the Lee weight and    ℤ  2  2     superscript   subscript  ℤ  2   2    \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{2}   with the Hamming weight. 6  References    .   .
