   Harish-Chandra character      Harish-Chandra character   In mathematics, the Harish-Chandra character , named after Harish-Chandra , of a representation of a semisimple Lie group  G on a Hilbert space  H is a distribution on the group G that is analogous to the character of a finite-dimensional representation of a compact group .  Definition  Suppose that π is an irreducible unitary representation of G on a Hilbert space H . If f is a compactly supported  smooth function on the group G , then the operator on H       π   (  f  )    =    ∫  G    f   (  x  )   π   (  x  )   d  x          π  f     subscript   G     f  x  π  x  d  x      \pi(f)=\int_{G}f(x)\pi(x)\,dx     is of trace class , and the distribution       Θ  π   :   f  ↦   Tr   (   π   (  f  )    )        normal-:   subscript  normal-Θ  π    maps-to  f   Tr    π  f       \Theta_{\pi}:f\mapsto\operatorname{Tr}(\pi(f))     is called the character (or global character or Harish-Chandra character ) of the representation.  The character Θ π is a distribution on G that is invariant under conjugation, and is an eigendistribution of the center of the universal enveloping algebra of G , in other words an invariant eigendistribution, with eigenvalue the infinitesimal character of the representation π.  Harish-Chandra's regularity theorem states that any invariant eigendistribution, and in particular any character of an irreducible unitary representation on a Hilbert space, is given by a locally integrable function .
