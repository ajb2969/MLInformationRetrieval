Algebraic Reconstruction Technique

frame|right|Animated sequence of reconstruction steps, one iteration.
The Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) is a class of iterative algorithms used in computed tomography. These reconstruct an image from a series of angular projections (a sinogram). Gordon, Bender and Herman first showed its use in image reconstruction;1 whereas the method is known as Kaczmarz method in numerical linear algebra.23
ART can be considered as an iterative solver of a system of linear equations. The values of the pixels are considered as variables collected in a vector 
 
 
 
 , and the image process is described by a matrix 
 
 
 
 . The measured angular projections are collected in a vector 
 
 
 
 . Given a real or complex 
 
 
 
  matrix 
 
 
 
  and a real or complex vector 
 
 
 
 , respectively, the method computes an approximation of the solution of the linear systems of equations as in the following formula,


 
  where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the i-th row of the matrix 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the i-th component of the vector 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is a relaxation parameter. The above formulae gives a simple iteration routine.
An advantage of ART over other reconstruction methods (such as filtered backprojection) is that it is relatively easy to incorporate prior knowledge into the reconstruction process.
For further details see Kaczmarz method.
