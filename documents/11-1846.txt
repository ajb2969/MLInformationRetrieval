   Algebraic Reconstruction Technique      Algebraic Reconstruction Technique   frame|right|Animated sequence of reconstruction steps, one iteration.  The Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) is a class of iterative algorithms used in computed tomography . These reconstruct an image from a series of angular projections (a sinogram ). Gordon , Bender and Herman first showed its use in image reconstruction; 1 whereas the method is known as Kaczmarz method in numerical linear algebra. 2 3  ART can be considered as an iterative solver of a system of linear equations. The values of the pixels are considered as variables collected in a vector   x   x   x   , and the image process is described by a matrix   A   A   A   . The measured angular projections are collected in a vector   b   b   b   . Given a real or complex    m  ×  n      m  n    m\times n   matrix   A   A   A   and a real or complex vector   b   b   b   , respectively, the method computes an approximation of the solution of the linear systems of equations as in the following formula,       x   k  +  1    =    x  k   +    λ  k      b  i   -   ⟨   a  i   ,   x  k   ⟩      ∥   a  i   ∥   2     a  i          superscript  x    k  1       superscript  x  k      subscript  λ  k        subscript  b  i     subscript  a  i    superscript  x  k      superscript   norm   subscript  a  i    2     subscript  a  i       x^{k+1}=x^{k}+\lambda_{k}\frac{b_{i}-\langle a_{i},x^{k}\rangle}{\lVert a_{i}%
 \rVert^{2}}a_{i}   where    i  =    k   mod   m  +  1        i   modulo  k    m  1      i=k\,\bmod\,m+1   ,    a  i     subscript  a  i    a_{i}   is the i -th row of the matrix   A   A   A   ,    b  i     subscript  b  i    b_{i}   is the i -th component of the vector   b   b   b   , and    λ  k     subscript  λ  k    \lambda_{k}   is a relaxation parameter. The above formulae gives a simple iteration routine.  An advantage of ART over other reconstruction methods (such as filtered backprojection ) is that it is relatively easy to incorporate prior knowledge into the reconstruction process.
