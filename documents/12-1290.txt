Magnetic diffusivity




Magnetic diffusivity

The magnetic diffusivity is a parameter in plasma physics. It appears in the Magnetic Reynolds number. The magnetic diffusivity is defined as:1


 
 .



 
  is the permeability of free space.


 
  is the electrical conductivity of the material in question. In case of a plasma, this is the conductivity due to Coulomb or neutral collisions
 
 
 
 , where
 


 
  is the electron density.


 
  is the electron charge.


 
  is the electron mass.


 
  is the collision frequency.
