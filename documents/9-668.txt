   Fermi coordinates      Fermi coordinates   In the mathematical theory of Riemannian geometry , Fermi coordinates are local coordinates that are adapted to a geodesic . 1  More formally, suppose M is an n -dimensional Riemannian manifold ,   γ   γ   \gamma   is a geodesic on   M   M   M   , and   p   p   p   is a point on   γ   γ   \gamma   . Then there exists local coordinates    (  t  ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )     t   superscript  x  2   normal-…   superscript  x  n     (t,x^{2},\ldots,x^{n})   around   p   p   p   such that:   For small t ,    (  t  ,  0  ,  …  ,  0  )     t  0  normal-…  0    (t,0,\ldots,0)   represents the geodesic near   p   p   p   ,  On   γ   γ   \gamma   , the metric tensor is the Euclidean metric,  On   γ   γ   \gamma   , all Christoffel symbols vanish.   Such coordinates are called Fermi coordinates and are named after the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi . The above properties are only valid on the geodesic. For example, if all Christoffel symbols vanish near   p   p   p   , then the manifold is flat near   p   p   p   .
