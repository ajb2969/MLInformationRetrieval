Fermi coordinates

In the mathematical theory of Riemannian geometry, Fermi coordinates are local coordinates that are adapted to a geodesic.1
More formally, suppose M is an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold, 
 
 
 
  is a geodesic on 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is a point on 
 
 
 
 . Then there exists local coordinates 
 
 
 
  around 
 
 
 
  such that:

For small t, 
 
 
 
  represents the geodesic near 
 
 
 
 ,
On 
 
 
 
 , the metric tensor is the Euclidean metric,
On 
 
 
 
 , all Christoffel symbols vanish.

Such coordinates are called Fermi coordinates and are named after the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. The above properties are only valid on the geodesic. For example, if all Christoffel symbols vanish near 
 
 
 
 , then the manifold is flat near 
 
 
 
 .
