Transfer entropy
'''Transfer entropy''' is a [[non-parametric statistics|non-parametric statistic]] measuring the amount of directed (time-asymmetric) transfer of [[information]] between two [[random process]]es.{{cite journal|last=Schreiber|first=Thomas|title=Measuring Information Transfer|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=1 July 2000|volume=85|issue=2|pages=461–464|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.461|url=http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v85/i2/p461_1}}{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2007 |title = Grang

More specifically, if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  denote two random processes and the amount of information is measured using Shannon's entropy, the transfer entropy can be written as:



where H(X) is Shannon entropy of X. The above definition of transfer entropy has been extended by other types of entropy measures such as Rényi entropy.2
Transfer entropy is conditional mutual information,34 with the history of the influenced variable 
 
 
 
  in the condition. Transfer entropy reduces to Granger causality for vector auto-regressive processes.5 Hence, it is advantageous when the model assumption of Granger causality doesn't hold, for example, analysis of non-linear signals.67 However, it usually requires more samples for accurate estimation.8 While it was originally defined for bivariate analysis, transfer entropy has been extended to multivariate forms, either conditioning on other potential source variables9 or considering transfer from a collection of sources,10 although these forms require more samples again.
Transfer entropy has been used for estimation of functional connectivity of neurons1112 and social influence in social networks.13
