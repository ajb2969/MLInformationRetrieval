Leray–Hirsch theorem

In mathematics, the Leray–Hirsch theorem1 is a basic result on the algebraic topology of fiber bundles. It is named after Jean Leray and Guy Hirsch, who independently proved it in the late 1940s. It can be thought of as a mild generalization of the Künneth formula, which computes the cohomology of a product space as a tensor product of the cohomologies of the direct factors. It is a very special case of the Leray spectral sequence.
Statement
Setup
Let 
 
 
 
 
  be a fibre bundle with fibre F. Assume that for each degree 
 
 
 
 , the singular cohomology rational vector space


 
  is finite-dimensional, and that the inclusion


 
  induces a surjection in rational cohomology


 
 . Consider a section of this surjection


 
 , by definition, this map satisfies


 
 .
The Leray–Hirsch isomorphism
The Leray–Hirsch theorem states that the linear map


 
  is an isomorphism of H*(B)-modules.
Statement in coordinates
In other words, if for every 
 
 
 
 , there exist classes



that restrict, on each fiber F, to a basis of the cohomology in degree 
 
 
 
 , the map given below is then an isomorphism of 
 
 
modules.


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a basis for 
 
 
 
  and thus, induces a basis 
 
 
 
  for
