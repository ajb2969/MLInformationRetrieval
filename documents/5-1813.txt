   Arithmetic genus      Arithmetic genus   In mathematics , the arithmetic genus of an algebraic variety is one of a few possible generalizations of the genus of an algebraic curve or Riemann surface .  Complex projective manifolds  The arithmetic genus of a complex projective manifold of dimension n can be defined as a combination of Hodge numbers , namely   p a = h n ,0 − h n − 1, 0 + ... + (−1) n − 1 h 1, 0 .   When n = 1 we have χ = 1 − g where g is the usual (topological) meaning of genus of a surface, so the definitions are compatible.  Kähler manifolds  By using h p , q = h q , p for compact Kähler manifolds this can be reformulated as the Euler characteristic in coherent cohomology for the structure sheaf     𝒪  M     subscript  𝒪  M    \mathcal{O}_{M}   :        p  a   =     (   -  1   )   n    (    χ   (   𝒪  M   )    -  1   )     .       subscript  p  a      superscript    1   n       χ   subscript  𝒪  M    1      p_{a}=(-1)^{n}(\chi(\mathcal{O}_{M})-1).\,     This definition therefore can be applied to some other locally ringed spaces .
