   Aralkylamine dehydrogenase (azurin)      Aralkylamine dehydrogenase (azurin)   Aralkylamine dehydrogenase (azurin) (, aromatic amine dehydrogenase , arylamine dehydrogenase , tyramine dehydrogenase ) is an enzyme with the systematic name aralkylamine:azurin oxidoreductase (deaminating) . 1 2 3 4 5 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction :   ArCH 2 NH 2 + H 2 O + 2 azurin    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ArCHO + NH 3 + 2 reduced azurin   The three substrates of this enzyme are RCH 2 NH 2 (i.e., an aromatic  amine ), water , and the acceptor  azurin , and its three products are RCHO , ammonia , and a reduced acceptor . Azurin can be replaced with the artificial acceptor phenazine methosulfate in in vitro studies. 6  This quinoprotein enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with other acceptors. This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism and phenylalanine metabolism . It is notable for its chemical mechanism , which is dominated by proton tunneling . 7  References  "  Category:EC 1.4.9  Category:Enzymes of known structure     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩
