Virial stress

Virial stress is a measure of mechanical stress on an atomic scale. It is given by


 
  where



 
  and 
 
 
 
  are atoms in the domain,


 
  is the volume of the domain,


 
  is the mass of atom k,


 
  is the ith component of the velocity of atom k,


 
  is the jth component of the average velocity of atoms in the volume,


 
  is the ith component of the position of atom k, and


 
  is the ith component of the force applied on atom 
 
 
 
  by atom 
 
 
 
 .

At zero kelvin, all velocities are zero so we have


 
 .
This can be thought of as follows. The Ï„11 component of stress is the force in the x1-direction divided by the area of a plane perpendicular to that direction. Consider two adjacent volumes separated by such a plane. The 11-component of stress on that interface is the sum of all pairwise forces between atoms on the two sides.
