   Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (ferredoxin)      Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (ferredoxin)   In enzymology , a methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (ferredoxin) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5-methyltetrahydrofolate + 2 oxidized ferredoxin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate + 2 reduced ferredoxin + 2 H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and oxidized ferredoxin , whereas its 3 products are 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate , reduced ferredoxin , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with an iron-sulfur protein as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-methyltetrahydrofolate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase . This enzyme participates in one carbon pool by folate .  References     "  Category:EC 1.5.7  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
