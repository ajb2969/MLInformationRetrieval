   Predictor–corrector method      Predictor–corrector method   In mathematics , particularly numerical analysis , a predictor–corrector method is an algorithm that proceeds in two steps. First, the prediction step calculates a rough approximation of the desired quantity. Second, the corrector step refines the initial approximation using another means. __TOC__  Predictor–corrector methods for solving ODEs  When considering the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) , a predictor–corrector method typically uses an explicit method for the predictor step and an implicit method for the corrector step.  Example: Euler method with the trapezoidal rule  A simple predictor–corrector method (known as Heun's method ) can be constructed from the Euler method (an explicit method) and the trapezoidal rule (an implicit method).  Consider the differential equation         y  ′   =   f   (  t  ,  y  )     ,    y   (   t  0   )    =   y  0     ,     formulae-sequence     superscript  y  normal-′     f   t  y         y   subscript  t  0     subscript  y  0      y^{\prime}=f(t,y),\quad y(t_{0})=y_{0},     and denote the step size by   h   h   h   .  First, the predictor step: starting from the current value    y  i     subscript  y  i    y_{i}   , calculate an initial guess value     y  ~    i  +  1      subscript   normal-~  y     i  1     \tilde{y}_{i+1}   via the Euler method,         y  ~    i  +  1    =    y  i   +   h  f   (   t  i   ,   y  i   )      .       subscript   normal-~  y     i  1       subscript  y  i     h  f    subscript  t  i    subscript  y  i        \tilde{y}_{i+1}=y_{i}+hf(t_{i},y_{i}).     Next, the corrector step: improve the initial guess using trapezoidal rule,        y   i  +  1    =    y  i   +     1  2    h   (    f   (   t  i   ,   y  i   )    +   f   (   t   i  +  1    ,    y  ~    i  +  1    )     )      .       subscript  y    i  1       subscript  y  i       1  2   h      f    subscript  t  i    subscript  y  i       f    subscript  t    i  1     subscript   normal-~  y     i  1           y_{i+1}=y_{i}+\tfrac{1}{2}h\bigl(f(t_{i},y_{i})+f(t_{i+1},\tilde{y}_{i+1})%
 \bigr).     That value is used as the next step.  PEC mode and PECE mode  There are different variants of a predictor–corrector method, depending on how often the corrector method is applied. The Predict–Evaluate–Correct–Evaluate (PECE) mode refers to the variant in the above example:       y  ~    i  +  1      subscript   normal-~  y     i  1     \displaystyle\tilde{y}_{i+1}     It is also possible to evaluate the function f only once per step by using the method in Predict–Evaluate–Correct (PEC) mode:       y  ~    i  +  1      subscript   normal-~  y     i  1     \displaystyle\tilde{y}_{i+1}     Additionally, the corrector step can be repeated in the hope that this achieves an even better approximation to the true solution. If the corrector method is run twice, this yields the PECECE mode:       y  ~    i  +  1      subscript   normal-~  y     i  1     \displaystyle\tilde{y}_{i+1}     The PECEC mode has one fewer function evaluation. More generally, if the corrector is run k times, the method is in P(EC) k or P(EC) k E mode. If the corrector method is iterated until it converges, this could be called PE(CE) ∞ . 1  See also   Backward differentiation formula  Beeman's algorithm  Heun's method  Mehrotra predictor–corrector method  Numerical continuation   Notes  References    .
