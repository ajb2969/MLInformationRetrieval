   Cut-off factor      Cut-off factor   Cut-off factor (AKA "Cut-off Length") is a factor used to calculate the length of a hose  cut to achieve the desired overall length of hose plus fittings . It is commonly seen in hydraulic hose and fitting specifications. The cut-off factor is specific to a particular hose fitting.  The formula used in calculating the optimum overall length is:       C  u   t   H  o  s   e   L  e  n  g  t   h    =    H  o  s   e   A  s  s  e  m  b  l   y   O  v  e  r  a  l   l   L  e  n  g  t  h   -   C  1   -   C  2          C  u  t  H  o  s  e  L  e  n  g  t  h       H  o  s  e  A  s  s  e  m  b  l  y  O  v  e  r  a  l  l  L  e  n  g  t  h     C  1     C  2      Cut\ Hose\ Length\ =Hose\ Assembly\ Overall\ Length-C1-C2   .  In this formula, C1 represents the cut-off factor of the first hose end and C2 represents the cut-off factor of the second hose end.  "  Category:Hydraulics
