   Inosine nucleosidase      Inosine nucleosidase   In enzymology , an inosine nucleosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   inosine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-ribose + hypoxanthine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are inosine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are D-ribose and hypoxanthine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosylases that hydrolyse N-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is inosine ribohydrolase . Other names in common use include inosinase , and inosine-guanosine nucleosidase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .
