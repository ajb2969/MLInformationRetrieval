   Carleson measure      Carleson measure   In mathematics , a Carleson measure is a type of measure on subsets of n - dimensional  Euclidean space  R n . Roughly speaking, a Carleson measure on a domain Ω is a measure that does not vanish at the boundary of Ω when compared to the surface measure on the boundary of Ω.  Carleson measures have many applications in harmonic analysis and the theory of partial differential equations , for instance in the solution of Dirichlet problems with "rough" boundary. The Carleson condition is closely related to the boundedness of the Poisson operator . Carleson measures are named after the Swedish  mathematician  Lennart Carleson .  Definition  Let n ∈ N and let Ω ⊂ R n be an open (and hence measurable ) set with non-empty boundary ∂Ω. Let μ be a Borel measure on Ω, and let σ denote the surface measure on ∂Ω. The measure μ is said to be a Carleson measure if there exists a constant C > 0 such that, for every point p ∈ ∂Ω and every radius r > 0,        μ   (   Ω  ∩    𝔹  r    (  p  )     )    ≤   C  σ   (    ∂  Ω   ∩    𝔹  r    (  p  )     )     ,        μ    normal-Ω     subscript  𝔹  r   p       C  σ      normal-Ω      subscript  𝔹  r   p       \mu\left(\Omega\cap\mathbb{B}_{r}(p)\right)\leq C\sigma\left(\partial\Omega%
 \cap\mathbb{B}_{r}(p)\right),     where        𝔹  r    (  p  )    :=   {   x  ∈   ℝ  n    |     ∥   x  -  p   ∥    ℝ  n    <  r   }      assign     subscript  𝔹  r   p    conditional-set    x   superscript  ℝ  n       subscript   norm    x  p     superscript  ℝ  n    r      \mathbb{B}_{r}(p):=\left\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\left|\|x-p\|_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}     denotes the open ball of radius r about p .  Carleson's theorem on the Poisson operator  Let D denote the unit disc in the complex plane C , equipped with some Borel measure μ . For 1 ≤ p  p (∂ D ) denote the Hardy space on the boundary of D and let L p ( D , μ ) denote the L p space on D with respect to the measure μ . Define the Poisson operator      P  :     H  p    (   ∂  D   )    →    L  p    (  D  ,  μ  )        normal-:  P   normal-→     superscript  H  p     D       superscript  L  p    D  μ       P:H^{p}(\partial D)\to L^{p}(D,\mu)     by        P   (  f  )    (  z  )    =    1   2  π      ∫  0   2  π     Re     e   i  t    +  z     e   i  t    -  z    f   (   e   i  t    )   d  t      .        P  f  z       1    2  π      superscript   subscript   0     2  π      Re       superscript  e    i  t    z      superscript  e    i  t    z    f   superscript  e    i  t    normal-d  t       P(f)(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\mathrm{Re}\frac{e^{it}+z}{e^{it}-z}f(e^{%
 it})\,\mathrm{d}t.     Then P is a bounded linear operator if and only if the measure μ is Carleson.
