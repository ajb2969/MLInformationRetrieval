Kalman–Yakubovich–Popov lemma

The Kalman–Yakubovich–Popov lemma is a result in system analysis and control theory which states: Given a number 
 
 
 
 , two n-vectors B, C and an n x n Hurwitz matrix A, if the pair 
 
 
 
  is completely controllable, then a symmetric matrix P and a vector Q satisfying






exist if and only if


 
  Moreover, the set 
 
 
 
  is the unobservable subspace for the pair 
 
 
 
 .
The lemma can be seen as a generalization of the Lyapunov equation in stability theory. It establishes a relation between a linear matrix inequality involving the state space constructs A, B, C and a condition in the frequency domain.
It was derived in 1962 by Rudolf E. Kalman,1 who brought together results by Vladimir Andreevich Yakubovich and Vasile Mihai Popov.

The corresponding equivalence for strict inequalities holds even if 
 
 
 
  is not controllable. 2
