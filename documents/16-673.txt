   Shannon Criteria      Shannon Criteria   The Shannon criteria constitute an empirical rule in neural engineering that is used for evaluation of possibility of damage from electrical stimulation to nervous tissue . 1  The Shannon criteria relate two parameters for pulsed electrical stimulation: charge density per phase, D (μCoulombs/(phase•cm²)) and charge per phase, Q (μCoulombs/phase) with a dimensionless parameter k:       log  D   =   k  -   log  Q          D     k    Q      \log D=k-\log Q     or, alternatively:       10  k   =   Q  *  D        superscript  10  k     Q  D     10^{k}=Q*D     According to these criteria, stimulation parameters that yield k > 1.75 could cause damage to the adjacent nervous tissue. Currently, this empirical law is applied in neuromodulation for development of implants for cortical, cochlear , retinal , 2 3  spinal cord 4 and deep brain stimulation . 5 6 Shannon categorizes the relationship between stimulating electrode and target neural tissue as either Near Field, Mid Field, or Far Field, and discusses how equation parameters may be chosen in each case.  Limitations  The data on which the Shannon model is built are restricted to experiments performed in cat cerebral cortex with 8 hours of stimulation at 50 Hz using surface disc electrodes of 1 mm² or larger.
