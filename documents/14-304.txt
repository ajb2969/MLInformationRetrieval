Milne-Thomson circle theorem

In fluid dynamics the Milne-Thomson circle theorem or the circle theorem is a statement giving a new stream function for a fluid flow when a cylinder is placed into that flow.12 It was named after the English mathematician L. M. Milne-Thomson.
Let 
 
 
 
  be the complex stream function for a fluid flow with no rigid boundaries and no singularities within 
 
 
 
 . If a circular cylinder 
 
 
 
  is placed into that flow, the complex potential for the new flow is given by:3
