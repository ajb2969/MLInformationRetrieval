   Kendrick mass      Kendrick mass  The '''Kendrick mass''' is defined by setting the mass of a chosen molecular fragment, typically CH 2 , to an integer value in [[atomic mass units]]. It is different from the IUPAC definition, which is based on setting the mass of 12 C isoto pe to exactly 12 u. The Kendrick mass is often used to identify homologous compounds differing only by a number of base units in high resolution mass spectra . 1 2 This definition of mass was first suggested in 1963 by chemist Edward Kendrick, and it has been adopted by scientists working in the area of high-resolution mass spectrometry , environmental analysis, proteomics , petroleomics, metabolomics , etc.  Definition  According to the procedure outlined by Kendrick, the mass of CH 2 is defined as exactly 14 Da, instead of the IUPAC mass of 14.01565 Da. 3 4  To convert an IUPAC mass of a particular compound to the Kendrick mass, the equation      Kendrick mass  =   IUPAC mass  ×   14.00000  14.01565        Kendrick mass    IUPAC mass    14.00000  14.01565      \textrm{Kendrick~{}mass}=\textrm{IUPAC~{}mass}\times\frac{14.00000}{14.01565}   .  is used. 5 6 7 8 The mass in dalton units ( Da ) can be converted to the Kendrick scale by dividing by 1.0011178. 9 10  Other groups of atoms in addition to CH 2 can be used define the Kendrick mass, for example CO 2 , H 2 , H 2 O, and O. 11 12 13 In this case, the Kendrick mass for a family of compounds F is given by      Kendrick mass (F)  =   (observed mass)  ×   nominal mass F  exact mass F        Kendrick mass (F)    (observed mass)    nominal mass F  exact mass F      \textrm{Kendrick~{}mass~{}(F)}=\textrm{(observed~{}mass)}\times\frac{\textrm{%
 nominal~{}mass~{}F}}{\textrm{exact~{}mass~{}F}}   .  For the hydrocarbon analysis, F=CH 2 .  A recent publication has suggested that Kendrick mass be expressed in Kendrick units with symbol Ke . 14  Kendrick mass defect  The Kendrick mass defect is defined as the exact Kendrick mass subtracted from the nominal (integer) Kendrick mass: 15 16      Kendrick mass defect  =   nominal Kendrick mass  -  Kendrick mass       Kendrick mass defect    nominal Kendrick mass  Kendrick mass     \textrm{Kendrick~{}mass~{}defect}=\textrm{nominal~{}Kendrick~{}mass}-\textrm{%
 Kendrick~{}mass}     In recent years the equation has changed due to rounding errors to:      Kendrick mass defect  =   nominal mass  -  Kendrick exact mass       Kendrick mass defect    nominal mass  Kendrick exact mass     \textrm{Kendrick~{}mass~{}defect}=\textrm{nominal~{}mass}-\textrm{Kendrick~{}%
 exact~{}mass}     The members of an alkylation series have the same degree of unsaturation and number of heteroatoms ( nitrogen , oxygen and sulfur ) but differ in the number of CH 2 units. Members of an alkylation series have the same Kendrick mass defect.  The Kendrick mass defect has also been defined as      Kendrick mass defect  =     (   nominal Kendrick mass  -  Kendrick mass   )   ×  1   ,  000       Kendrick mass defect       nominal Kendrick mass  Kendrick mass   1   000     \textrm{Kendrick~{}mass~{}defect}=(\textrm{nominal~{}Kendrick~{}mass}-\textrm{%
 Kendrick~{}mass})\times 1{,}000   . 17  The abbreviations KM and KMD have been used for Kendrick mass and Kendrick mass defect, respectively. In some definitions, the KMD 18  Kendrick mass analysis  (Figure)  300 px|Plot of Kendrick mass defect as function of Kendrick mass; horizontal lines indicate common repeat units. Each dot in the plot corresponds to a peak measured in a mass spectrum.   In a Kendrick mass analysis, the Kendrick mass defect is plotted as function of nominal Kendrick mass for ions observed in a mass spectrum. 19 Ions of the same family, for example the members of an alkylation series, have the same Kendrick mass defect but different nominal Kendrick mass and are positioned along a horizontal line on the plot. If the composition of one ion in the family can be determined, the composition of the other ions can be inferred. Horizontal lines of different Kendrick mass defect correspond to ions of different composition, for example degree of saturation or heteroatom content.  A Kendrick mass analysis is often used in conjunction with a Van Krevelen diagram , a two- or three- dimensional graphical analysis in which the elemental composition of the compounds are plotted according to the atomic ratios H/C, O/C, or N/C. 20 21  See also   Petroleomics   Notes  "  Category:Units of mass  Category:Metrology  Category:Mass spectrometry     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩    ↩
