   Technicolor (physics)      Technicolor (physics)   Technicolor theories are models of physics  beyond the standard model that address electroweak gauge symmetry breaking , the mechanism through which W and Z bosons acquire masses. Early technicolor theories were modelled on quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the "color" theory of the strong nuclear force , which inspired their name.  Instead of introducing elementary Higgs bosons to explain observed phenomena, technicolor models hide electroweak symmetry and generate masses for the W and Z bosons through the dynamics of new gauge interactions . Although asymptotically free at very high energies, these interactions must become strong and confining (and hence unobservable) at lower energies that have been experimentally probed. This dynamical approach is natural and avoids issues of Quantum triviality and the hierarchy problem of the Standard Model. 1  In order to produce quark and lepton masses, technicolor has to be "extended" by additional gauge interactions. Particularly when modelled on QCD, extended technicolor is challenged by experimental constraints on flavor-changing neutral current and precision electroweak measurements . It is not known what is the extended technicolor dynamics.  Much technicolor research focuses on exploring strongly interacting gauge theories other than QCD, in order to evade some of these challenges. A particularly active framework is "walking" technicolor, which exhibits nearly conformal behavior caused by an infrared fixed point with strength just above that necessary for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. Whether walking can occur and lead to agreement with precision electroweak measurements is being studied through non-perturbative  lattice simulations. 2  Experiments at the Large Hadron Collider are expected to discover the mechanism responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking, and will be critical for determining whether the technicolor framework provides the correct description of nature. In 2012 these experiments declared the discovery of a Higgs-like boson with mass approximately ; 3 4 5 such a particle is not generically predicted by technicolor models, but can be accommodated by them.  Introduction  The mechanism for the breaking of electroweak  gauge symmetry in the Standard Model of elementary particle interactions remains unknown. The breaking must be spontaneous , meaning that the underlying theory manifests the symmetry exactly (the gauge-boson fields are massless in the equations of motion), but the solutions (the ground state and the excited states) do not. In particular, the physical W and Z gauge bosons become massive. This phenomenon, in which the W and Z bosons also acquire an extra polarization state, is called the "Higgs mechanism". Despite the precise agreement of the electroweak theory with experiment at energies accessible so far, the necessary ingredients for the symmetry breaking remain hidden, yet to be revealed at higher energies.  The simplest mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking introduces a single complex field and predicts the existence of the Higgs boson . Typically, the Higgs boson is "unnatural" in the sense that quantum mechanical fluctuations produce corrections to its mass that lift it to such high values that it cannot play the role for which it was introduced. Unless the Standard Model breaks down at energies less than a few TeV, the Higgs mass can be kept small only by a delicate fine-tuning of parameters.  Technicolor avoids this problem by hypothesizing a new gauge interaction coupled to new massless fermions. This interaction is asymptotically free at very high energies and becomes strong and confining as the energy decreases to the electroweak scale of 246 GeV. These strong forces spontaneously break the massless fermions' chiral symmetries, some of which are weakly gauged as part of the Standard Model. This is the dynamical version of the Higgs mechanism. The electroweak gauge symmetry is thus broken, producing masses for the W and Z bosons.  The new strong interaction leads to a host of new composite, short-lived particles at energies accessible at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This framework is natural because there are no elementary Higgs bosons and, hence, no fine-tuning of parameters. Quark and lepton masses also break the electroweak gauge symmetries, so they, too, must arise spontaneously. A mechanism for incorporating this feature is known as extended technicolor. Technicolor and extended technicolor face a number of phenomenological challenges, in particular issues of flavor-changing neutral currents , precision electroweak tests , and the top quark mass. Technicolor models also do not generically predict Higgs-like bosons as light as ; such a particle was discovered by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012. 6 7 8 Some of these issues can be addressed with a class of theories known as walking technicolor.  Early technicolor  Technicolor is the name given to the theory of electroweak symmetry breaking by new strong gauge-interactions whose characteristic energy scale Œõ TC is the weak scale itself, Œõ TC ‚âÖ F EW ‚â° 246 GeV. The guiding principle of technicolor is "naturalness": basic physical phenomena should not require fine-tuning of the parameters in the Lagrangian that describes them. What constitutes fine-tuning is to some extent a subjective matter, but a theory with elementary scalar particles typically is very finely tuned (unless it is supersymmetric ). The quadratic divergence in the scalar's mass requires adjustments of a part in    ùí™   (    M  bare  2    M  physical  2    )       ùí™     subscript   superscript  M  2   bare    subscript   superscript  M  2   physical      \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{M^{2}_{\mathrm{bare}}}{M^{2}_{\mathrm{physical}}}\right)   , where M bare is the cutoff of the theory, the energy scale at which the theory changes in some essential way. In the standard electroweak model with M bare ‚àº 10 15 GeV (the grand-unification mass scale), and with the Higgs boson mass M physical = 100‚Äì500 GeV, the mass is tuned to at least a part in 10 25 .  By contrast, a natural theory of electroweak symmetry breaking is an asymptotically free gauge theory with fermions as the only matter fields. The technicolor gauge group G TC is often assumed to be SU ( N TC ). Based on analogy with quantum chromodynamics (QCD), it is assumed that there are one or more doublets of massless Dirac "technifermions" transforming vectorially under the same complex representation of G TC , T iL,R = ( U i , D i ) L,R , i = 1,2, ‚Ä¶, N f /2. Thus, there is a chiral symmetry of these fermions, e.g., SU ( N f ) L ‚äó SU ( N f ) R , if they all transform according the same complex representation of G TC . Continuing the analogy with QCD, the running gauge coupling Œ± TC (Œº) triggers spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, the technifermions acquire a dynamical mass, and a number of massless Goldstone bosons result. If the technifermions transform under [ SU (2) ‚äó U (1)] EW as left-handed doublets and right-handed singlets, three linear combinations of these Goldstone bosons couple to three of the electroweak gauge currents.  In 1973 Jackiw and Johnson 9 and Cornwall and Norton 10 studied the possibility that a (non-vectorial) gauge interaction of fermions can break itself; i.e., is strong enough to form a Goldstone boson coupled to the gauge current. Using Abelian gauge models, they showed that, if such a Goldstone boson is formed, it is "eaten" by the Higgs mechanism, becoming the longitudinal component of the now massive gauge boson. Technically, the polarization function Œ†( p 2 ) appearing in the gauge boson propagator, Œî ŒºŒΩ = ( p Œº  p ŒΩ / p 2 - g ŒºŒΩ )/[ p 2 (1 - g 2 Œ†( p 2 ))] develops a pole at p 2 = 0 with residue F 2 , the square of the Goldstone boson's decay constant, and the gauge boson acquires mass M ‚âÖ g F . In 1973, Weinstein 11 showed that composite Goldstone bosons whose constituent fermions transform in the ‚Äústandard‚Äù way under SU (2) ‚äó U (1) generate the weak boson masses          (  1  )    M   W  ¬±     =    1  2   g   F   E  W        and   M  Z    =    1  2      g  2   +   g   ‚Ä≤  2       F   E  W     ‚â°     M  W    cos   Œ∏  W        .     formulae-sequence     1   subscript  M   superscript  W  plus-or-minus         1  2   g   subscript  F    E  W           and   subscript  M  Z        1  2        superscript  g  2    superscript  g   normal-‚Ä≤  2       subscript  F    E  W             subscript  M  W      subscript  Œ∏  W         (1)\qquad M_{W^{\pm}}={\frac{1}{2}}gF_{EW}\quad{\rm and}\quad M_{Z}={\frac{1}{%
 2}}\sqrt{g^{2}+g^{\prime\,2}}F_{EW}\equiv\frac{M_{W}}{\cos\theta_{W}}\,.     This standard-model relation is achieved with elementary Higgs bosons in electroweak doublets; it is verified experimentally to better than 1%. Here, g and g ‚Ä≤ are SU (2) and U (1) gauge couplings and tanŒ∏ W = g ‚Ä≤/ g defines the weak mixing angle.  The important idea of a new strong gauge interaction of massless fermions at the electroweak scale F EW driving the spontaneous breakdown of its global chiral symmetry, of which an SU (2) ‚äó U (1) subgroup is weakly gauged, was first proposed in 1979 by S. Weinberg 12 and L. Susskind. 13 This "technicolor" mechanism is natural in that no fine-tuning of parameters is necessary.  Extended technicolor  Elementary Higgs bosons perform another important task. In the Standard Model , quarks and leptons are necessarily massless because they transform under SU (2) ‚äó U (1) as left-handed doublets and right-handed singlets. The Higgs doublet couples to these fermions. When it develops its vacuum expectation value, it transmits this electroweak breaking to the quarks and leptons, giving them their observed masses. (In general, electroweak-eigenstate fermions are not mass eigenstates, so this process also induces the mixing matrices observed in charged-current weak interactions.)  In technicolor, something else must generate the quark and lepton masses. The only natural possibility, one avoiding the introduction of elementary scalars, is to enlarge G TC to allow technifermions to couple to quarks and leptons. This coupling is induced by gauge bosons of the enlarged group. The picture, then, is that there is a large "extended technicolor" (ETC) gauge group G ETC ‚äÉ G TC in which technifermions, quarks, and leptons live in the same representations . At one or more high scales Œõ ETC , G ETC is broken down to G TC , and quarks and leptons emerge as the TC-singlet fermions. When Œ± TC (Œº) becomes strong at scale Œõ TC ‚âÖ F EW , the fermionic condensate       ‚ü®    T  ¬Ø   T   ‚ü©    T  C    ‚âÖ   4  œÄ   F   E  W   3         subscript   delimited-‚ü®‚ü©     normal-¬Ø  T   T      T  C      4  œÄ   superscript   subscript  F    E  W    3      \langle\bar{T}T\rangle_{TC}\cong 4\pi F_{EW}^{3}   forms. (The condensate is the vacuum expectation value of the technifermion bilinear     T  ¬Ø   T       normal-¬Ø  T   T    \bar{T}T   . The estimate here is based on naive dimensional analysis of the quark condensate in QCD , expected to be correct as an order of magnitude.)

The second estimate in Eq. (2) depends on the assumption that, as happens in QCD, Œ± TC (Œº) becomes weak not far above Œõ TC , so that the anomalous dimension Œ≥ m of     T  ¬Ø   T       normal-¬Ø  T   T    \bar{T}T   is small there. Extended technicolor was introduced in 1979 by Dimopoulos and Susskind, 14 and by Eichten and Lane. 15 For a quark of mass m q ‚âÖ 1 GeV, and with Œõ TC ‚âÖ 246 GeV, one estimates Œõ ETC ‚âÖ 15 TeV. Therefore, assuming that     g   E  T  C   2   ‚â≥  1     greater-than-or-equivalent-to   subscript   superscript  g  2     E  T  C    1    g^{2}_{ETC}\gtrsim 1   , M ETC will be at least this large.  In addition to the ETC proposal for quark and lepton masses, Eichten and Lane observed that the size of the ETC representations required to generate all quark and lepton masses suggests that there will be more than one electroweak doublet of technifermions. 16 If so, there will be more (spontaneously broken) chiral symmetries and therefore more Goldstone bosons than are eaten by the Higgs mechanism. These must acquire mass by virtue of the fact that the extra chiral symmetries are also explicitly broken, by the standard-model interactions and the ETC interactions. These "pseudo-Goldstone bosons" are called technipions, œÄ T . An application of Dashen's theorem 17 gives for the ETC contribution to their mass         (  4  )     F   E  W   2    M   œÄ  T   2     ‚âÖ     g   E  T  C   2     ‚ü®    T  ¬Ø   T   T  ¬Ø   T   ‚ü©    E  T  C      M   E  T  C   2    ‚âÖ     16   œÄ  2    F   E  W   6     Œõ   E  T  C   2      .         4     superscript   subscript  F    E  W    2    superscript   subscript  M    œÄ  T    2          superscript   subscript  g    E  T  C    2    subscript   delimited-‚ü®‚ü©     normal-¬Ø  T   T   normal-¬Ø  T   T      E  T  C      superscript   subscript  M    E  T  C    2             16   superscript  œÄ  2    superscript   subscript  F    E  W    6     superscript   subscript  normal-Œõ    E  T  C    2       (4)\qquad F_{EW}^{2}M_{\pi T}^{2}\cong\frac{g_{ETC}^{2}\langle\bar{T}T\bar{T}T%

(4) assumes that      ‚ü®    T  ¬Ø   T   T  ¬Ø   T   ‚ü©    E  T  C    ‚âÖ    ‚ü®    T  ¬Ø   T   ‚ü©    E  T  C   2        subscript   delimited-‚ü®‚ü©     normal-¬Ø  T   T   normal-¬Ø  T   T      E  T  C     subscript   superscript   delimited-‚ü®‚ü©     normal-¬Ø  T   T    2     E  T  C      \langle\bar{T}T\bar{T}T\rangle_{ETC}\cong\langle\bar{T}T\rangle^{2}_{ETC}   . For F EW ‚âÖ Œõ TC ‚âÖ 246 GeV and Œõ ETC ‚âÖ 15 TeV, this contribution to M œÄT is about 50 GeV. Since ETC interactions generate    m   q  ,  ‚Ñì      subscript  m   q  normal-‚Ñì     m_{q,\ell}    and the coupling of technipions to quark and lepton pairs, one expects the couplings to be Higgs-like; i.e., roughly proportional to the masses of the quarks and leptons. This means that technipions are expected to decay to the heaviest     q  ¬Ø   q       normal-¬Ø  q   q    \bar{q}q   and     ‚Ñì  ¬Ø   ‚Ñì       normal-¬Ø  normal-‚Ñì   normal-‚Ñì    \bar{\ell}\ell   pairs allowed.  Perhaps the most important restriction on the ETC framework for quark mass generation is that ETC interactions are likely to induce flavor-changing neutral current processes such as Œº ‚Üí e Œ≥, K L ‚Üí Œº e , and |Œî S | = 2 and |Œî B | = 2 interactions that induce     K  0   ‚Üî    K  ¬Ø   0      normal-‚Üî   superscript  K  0    superscript   normal-¬Ø  K   0     K^{0}\leftrightarrow\bar{K}^{0}   and     B  0   ‚Üî    B  ¬Ø   0      normal-‚Üî   superscript  B  0    superscript   normal-¬Ø  B   0     B^{0}\leftrightarrow\bar{B}^{0}   mixing. 18 The reason is that the algebra of the ETC currents involved in    m   q  ,  ‚Ñì      subscript  m   q  normal-‚Ñì     m_{q,\ell}   generation imply     q  ¬Ø    q  ‚Ä≤        normal-¬Ø  q    superscript  q  normal-‚Ä≤     \bar{q}q^{\prime}   and     ‚Ñì  ¬Ø    ‚Ñì  ‚Ä≤        normal-¬Ø  normal-‚Ñì    superscript  normal-‚Ñì  normal-‚Ä≤     \bar{\ell}\ell^{\prime}   ETC currents which, when written in terms of fermion mass eigenstates, have no reason to conserve flavor. The strongest constraint comes from requiring that ETC interactions mediating    K  ‚Äì   K  ¬Ø       K  ‚Äì   normal-¬Ø  K     K\hbox{--}\bar{K}   mixing contribute less than the Standard Model. This implies an effective Œõ ETC greater than 1000 TeV. The actual Œõ ETC may be reduced somewhat if CKM-like mixing angle factors are present. If these interactions are CP-violating, as they well may be, the constraint from the Œµ-parameter is that the effective Œõ ETC > 10 4 TeV. Such huge ETC mass scales imply tiny quark and lepton masses and ETC contributions to M œÄ T of at most a few GeV, in conflict with LEP searches for œÄ T at the Z 0 .  Extended technicolor is a very ambitious proposal, requiring that quark and lepton masses and mixing angles arise from experimentally accessible interactions. If there exists a successful model, it would not only predict the masses and mixings of quarks and leptons (and technipions), it would explain why there are three families of each: they are the ones that fit into the ETC representations of q ,   ‚Ñì   normal-‚Ñì   \ell   and T . It should not be surprising that the construction of a successful model has proven to be very difficult.  Walking technicolor  Since quark and lepton masses are proportional to the bilinear technifermion condensate divided by the ETC mass scale squared, their tiny values can be avoided if the condensate is enhanced above the weak-Œ± TC estimate in Eq.

 {3}   .  During the 1980s, several dynamical mechanisms were advanced to do this. In 1981 Holdom suggested that, if the Œ± TC (Œº) evolves to a nontrivial fixed point in the ultraviolet, with a large positive anomalous dimension Œ≥ m for     T  ¬Ø   T       normal-¬Ø  T   T    \bar{T}T   , realistic quark and lepton masses could arise with Œõ ETC large enough to suppress ETC-induced    K  ‚Äì   K  ¬Ø       K  ‚Äì   normal-¬Ø  K     K\hbox{--}\bar{K}   mixing. 19 However, no example of a nontrivial ultraviolet fixed point in a four-dimensional gauge theory has been constructed. In 1985 Holdom analyzed a technicolor theory in which a ‚Äúslowly varying‚Äù Œ± TC (Œº) was envisioned. 20 His focus was to separate the chiral breaking and confinement scales, but he also noted that such a theory could enhance     ‚ü®    T  ¬Ø   T   ‚ü©    E  T  C      subscript   delimited-‚ü®‚ü©     normal-¬Ø  T   T      E  T  C     \langle\bar{T}T\rangle_{ETC}   and thus allow the ETC scale to be raised. In 1986 Akiba and Yanagida also considered enhancing quark and lepton masses, by simply assuming that Œ± TC is constant and strong all the way up to the ETC scale. 21 In the same year Yamawaki, Bando and Matumoto again imagined an ultraviolet fixed point in a non- asymptotically free theory to enhance the technifermion condensate. 22  In 1986 Appelquist, Karabali and Wijewardhana discussed the enhancement of fermion masses in an asymptotically free technicolor theory with a slowly running, or ‚Äúwalking‚Äù, gauge coupling. 23 The slowness arose from the screening effect of a large number of technifermions, with the analysis carried out through two-loop perturbation theory. In 1987 Appelquist and Wijewardhana explored this walking scenario further. 24 They took the analysis to three loops, noted that the walking can lead to a power law enhancement of the technifermion condensate, and estimated the resultant quark, lepton, and technipion masses. The condensate enhancement arises because the associated technifermion mass decreases slowly, roughly linearly, as a function of its renormalization scale. This corresponds to the condensate anomalous dimension Œ≥ m in Eq. (3) approaching unity (see below). 25  In the 1990s, the idea emerged more clearly that walking is naturally described by asymptotically free gauge theories dominated in the infrared by an approximate fixed point. Unlike the speculative proposal of ultraviolet fixed points, fixed points in the infrared are known to exist in asymptotically free theories, arising at two loops in the beta function providing that the fermion count N f is large enough. This has been known since the first two-loop computation in 1974 by Caswell. 26 If N f is close to the value     N  ^   f     subscript   normal-^  N   f    \hat{N}_{f}   at which asymptotic freedom is lost, the resultant infrared fixed point is weak, of parametric order      N  ^   f   -   N  f        subscript   normal-^  N   f    subscript  N  f     \hat{N}_{f}-N_{f}   , and reliably accessible in perturbation theory. This weak-coupling limit was explored by Banks and Zaks in 1982. 27  The fixed-point coupling Œ± IR becomes stronger as N f is reduced from     N  ^   f     subscript   normal-^  N   f    \hat{N}_{f}   . Below some critical value N fc the coupling becomes strong enough (> Œ± œá SB ) to break spontaneously the massless technifermions' chiral symmetry . Since the analysis must typically go beyond two-loop perturbation theory, the definition of the running coupling Œ± TC (Œº), its fixed point value Œ± IR , and the strength Œ± œá SB necessary for chiral symmetry breaking depend on the particular renormalization scheme adopted.

To overcome the    M   E  T  C   2     superscript   subscript  M    E  T  C    2    M_{ETC}^{2}   -suppression of the masses of first and second generation quarks involved in    K  ‚Äì   K  ¬Ø       K  ‚Äì   normal-¬Ø  K     K\hbox{--}\bar{K}   mixing, this range must extend almost to their ETC scale, of    ùí™   (    10  3   TeV   )       ùí™     superscript  10  3   TeV     \mathcal{O}(10^{3}\hbox{ TeV})   . Cohen and Georgi argued that Œ≥ m = 1 is the signal of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, i.e., that Œ≥ m (Œ± œá SB ) = 1. 28 Therefore, in the walking-Œ± TC region, Œ≥ m ‚âÖ 1 and, from Eqs. (2) and (3), the light quark masses are enhanced approximately by M ETC /Œõ TC .  The idea that Œ± TC (Œº) walks for a large range of momenta when Œ± IR lies just above Œ± œá SB was suggested by Lane and Ramana. 29 They made an explicit model, discussed the walking that ensued, and used it in their discussion of walking technicolor phenomenology at hadron colliders. This idea was developed in some detail by Appelquist, Terning and Wijewardhana. 30 Combining a perturbative computation of the infrared fixed point with an approximation of Œ± œá SB based on the Schwinger-Dyson equation , they estimated the critical value N fc and explored the resultant electroweak physics. Since the 1990s, most discussions of walking technicolor are in the framework of theories assumed to be dominated in the infrared by an approximate fixed point. Various models have been explored, some with the technifermions in the fundamental representation of the gauge group and some employing higher representations. 31 32 33  The possibility that the technicolor condensate can be enhanced beyond that discussed in the walking literature, has also been considered recently by Luty and Okui under the name "conformal technicolor". 34 They envision an infrared stable fixed point, but with a very large anomalous dimension for the operator     T  ¬Ø   T       normal-¬Ø  T   T    \bar{T}T   . It remains to be seen whether this can be realized, for example, in the class of theories currently being examined using lattice techniques.  Top quark mass  The walking enhancement described above may be insufficient to generate the measured top quark mass, even for an ETC scale as low as a few TeV. However, this problem could be addressed if the effective four-technifermion coupling resulting from ETC gauge boson exchange is strong and tuned just above a critical value. 35 The analysis of this strong-ETC possibility is that of a Nambu‚ÄìJona‚ÄìLasinio model with an additional (technicolor) gauge interaction. The technifermion masses are small compared to the ETC scale (the cutoff on the effective theory), but nearly constant out to this scale, leading to a large top quark mass. No fully realistic ETC theory for all quark masses has yet been developed incorporating these ideas. A related study was carried out by Miransky and Yamawaki. 36 A problem with this approach is that it involves some degree of parameter fine-tuning , in conflict with technicolor‚Äôs guiding principle of naturalness.  Finally, it should be noted that there is a large body of closely related work in which ETC does not generate m t . These are the top quark condensate , 37  topcolor and top-color-assisted technicolor models, 38 in which new strong interactions are ascribed to the top quark and other third-generation fermions. As with the strong-ETC scenario described above, all these proposals involve a considerable degree of fine-tuning of gauge couplings.  Minimal Walking Models  In 2004 Francesco Sannino and Kimmo Tuominen proposed technicolor models with technifermions in higher-dimensional representations of the technicolor gauge group. 39 They argued that these more "minimal" models required fewer flavors of technifermions in order to exhibit walking behavior, making it easier to pass precision electroweak tests .  For example, SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories may exhibit walking with as few as two Dirac flavors of fermions in the adjoint or two-index symmetric representation. In contrast, at least eight flavors of fermions in the fundamental representation of SU(3) (and possibly SU(2) as well) are required to reach the near-conformal regime. 40  These results continue to be investigated by various methods, including lattice simulations discussed below, which have confirmed the near-conformal dynamics of these minimal walking models. The first comprehensive effective Lagrangian for minimal walking models, featuring a light composite Higgs, spin-one states, tree-level unitarity , and consistency with phenomenological constraints was constructed in 2007 by Foadi, Frandsen, Ryttov and Sannino. 41  Technicolor on the lattice  Lattice gauge theory is a non-perturbative method applicable to strongly interacting technicolor theories, allowing first-principles exploration of walking and conformal dynamics. In 2007, Catterall and Sannino used lattice gauge theory to study SU (2) gauge theories with two flavors of Dirac fermions in the symmetric representation, 42 finding evidence of conformality that has been confirmed by subsequent studies. 43  As of 2010, the situation for SU (3) gauge theory with fermions in the fundamental representation is not as clear-cut. In 2007, Appelquist, Fleming and Neil reported evidence that a non-trivial infrared fixed point develops in such theories when there are twelve flavors, but not when there are eight. 44 While some subsequent studies confirmed these results, others reported different conclusions, depending on the lattice methods used, and there is not yet consensus. 45  Further lattice studies exploring these issues, as well as considering the consequences of these theories for precision electroweak measurements , are underway by several research groups. 46  Technicolor phenomenology  Any framework for physics beyond the Standard Model must conform with precision measurements of the electroweak parameters. Its consequences for physics at existing and future high-energy hadron colliders, and for the dark matter of the universe must also be explored.  Precision electroweak tests  In 1990, the phenomenological parameters S , T , and U were introduced by Peskin and Takeuchi to quantify contributions to electroweak radiative corrections from physics beyond the Standard Model. 47 They have a simple relation to the parameters of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian. 48 49 The Peskin-Takeuchi analysis was based on the general formalism for weak radiative corrections developed by Kennedy, Lynn, Peskin and Stuart, 50 and alternate formulations also exist. 51  The S , T , and U -parameters describe corrections to the electroweak gauge boson propagators from physics Beyond the Standard Model . They can be written in terms of polarization functions of electroweak currents and their spectral representation as follows:          (  5  )   S       =   16  œÄ    d   d   q  2        [     Œ†  33  ùêßùêûùê∞    (   q  2   )    -    Œ†   3  Q   ùêßùêûùê∞    (   q  2   )     ]     q  2   =  0              =   4  œÄ    ‚à´     d   m  2     m  4      [     œÉ  V  3    (   m  2   )    -    œÉ  A  3    (   m  2   )     ]   ùêßùêûùê∞        ;         (  6  )   T       =       16  œÄ     M  Z  2     sin  2    2   Œ∏  W          [     Œ†  11  ùêßùêûùê∞    (  0  )    -    Œ†  33  ùêßùêûùê∞    (  0  )     ]             =      4  œÄ     M  Z  2     sin  2    2   Œ∏  W           ‚à´  0  ‚àû        d   m  2     m  2       [      œÉ  V  1    (   m  2   )    +    œÉ  A  1    (   m  2   )     -    œÉ  V  3    (   m  2   )    -    œÉ  A  3    (   m  2   )     ]   ùêßùêûùê∞       ,          5  S     absent    16  œÄ    d    d   superscript  q  2      subscript   delimited-[]       superscript   subscript  normal-Œ†  33   ùêßùêûùê∞    superscript  q  2       superscript   subscript  normal-Œ†    3  Q    ùêßùêûùê∞    superscript  q  2         superscript  q  2   0         missing-subexpression     absent    4  œÄ          d   superscript  m  2     superscript  m  4     superscript   delimited-[]       subscript   superscript  œÉ  3   V    superscript  m  2       subscript   superscript  œÉ  3   A    superscript  m  2      ùêßùêûùê∞          6  T     absent        16  œÄ      subscript   superscript  M  2   Z     superscript   2     2   subscript  Œ∏  W        delimited-[]       superscript   subscript  normal-Œ†  11   ùêßùêûùê∞   0      superscript   subscript  normal-Œ†  33   ùêßùêûùê∞   0          missing-subexpression     absent        4  œÄ      subscript   superscript  M  2   Z     superscript   2     2   subscript  Œ∏  W         superscript   subscript   0           d   superscript  m  2     superscript  m  2     superscript   delimited-[]         superscript   subscript  œÉ  V   1    superscript  m  2       superscript   subscript  œÉ  A   1    superscript  m  2        superscript   subscript  œÉ  V   3    superscript  m  2       superscript   subscript  œÉ  A   3    superscript  m  2      ùêßùêûùê∞          \begin{aligned}\displaystyle(5)\qquad S&\displaystyle=16\pi\frac{d}{dq^{2}}%

The quantities are calculated relative to a minimal Standard Model with some chosen reference mass of the Higgs boson , taken to range from the experimental lower bound of 117 GeV to 1000 GeV where its width becomes very large. 52 For these parameters to describe the dominant corrections to the Standard Model, the mass scale of the new physics must be much greater than M W and M Z , and the coupling of quarks and leptons to the new particles must be suppressed relative to their coupling to the gauge bosons. This is the case with technicolor, so long as the lightest technivector mesons, œÅ T and a T , are heavier than 200‚Äì300 GeV. The S -parameter is sensitive to all new physics at the TeV scale, while T is a measure of weak-isospin breaking effects. The U -parameter is generally not useful; most new-physics theories, including technicolor theories, give negligible contributions to it.  The S and T -parameters are determined by global fit to experimental data including Z -pole data from LEP at CERN , top quark and W -mass measurements at Fermilab, and measured levels of atomic parity violation. The resultant bounds on these parameters are given in the Review of Particle Properties. 53 Assuming U = 0, the S and T parameters are small and, in fact, consistent with zero:       (  7  )      S       =    -  0.04   ¬±    0.09    (   -  0.07   )      ,       T       =   0.02  ¬±    0.09    (   +  0.09   )      ,         7    S    absent   plus-or-minus    0.04     0.09    0.07        T    absent   plus-or-minus  0.02    0.09    0.09          (7)\qquad\begin{aligned}\displaystyle S&\displaystyle=-0.04\pm 0.09\,(-0.07),%

These values place tight restrictions on beyond-standard-model theories‚Äîwhen the relevant corrections can be reliably computed.  The S parameter estimated in QCD -like technicolor theories is significantly greater than the experimentally allowed value. 54 55 The computation was done assuming that the spectral integral for S is dominated by the lightest œÅ T and a T resonances, or by scaling effective Lagrangian parameters from QCD. In walking technicolor, however, the physics at the TeV scale and beyond must be quite different from that of QCD-like theories. In particular, the vector and axial-vector spectral functions cannot be dominated by just the lowest-lying resonances. 56 It is unknown whether higher energy contributions to    œÉ   V  ,  A   3     superscript   subscript  œÉ   V  A    3    \sigma_{V,A}^{3}   are a tower of identifiable œÅ T and a T states or a smooth continuum. It has been conjectured that œÅ T and a T partners could be more nearly degenerate in walking theories (approximate parity doubling), reducing their contribution to S . 57  Lattice calculations are underway or planned to test these ideas and obtain reliable estimates of S in walking theories. 58 59  The restriction on the T -parameter poses a problem for the generation of the top-quark mass in the ETC framework. The enhancement from walking can allow the associated ETC scale to be as large as a few TeV, 60 but‚Äîsince the ETC interactions must be strongly weak-isospin breaking to allow for the large top-bottom mass splitting‚Äîthe contribution to the T parameter, 61 as well as the rate for the decay     Z  0   ‚Üí    b  ¬Ø   b      normal-‚Üí   superscript  Z  0      normal-¬Ø  b   b     Z^{0}\rightarrow\bar{b}b   , 62 could be too large.  Hadron collider phenomenology  Early studies generally assumed the existence of just one electroweak doublet of technifermions, or of one techni-family including one doublet each of color-triplet techniquarks and color-singlet technileptons (four electroweak doublets in total). 63 The number N D of electroweak doublets determines the decay constant F needed to produce the correct electroweak scale, as F = F EW / = 246 GeV/ . In the minimal, one-doublet model, three Goldstone bosons (technipions, œÄ T ) have decay constant F = F EW = 246 GeV and are eaten by the electroweak gauge bosons. The most accessible collider signal is the production through     q  ¬Ø   q       normal-¬Ø  q   q    \bar{q}q   annihilation in a hadron collider of spin-one    œÅ  T   ¬±  ,  0      superscript   subscript  œÅ  T    plus-or-minus  0     \rho_{T}^{\pm,0}   , and their subsequent decay into a pair of longitudinally polarized weak bosons,     W  L  ¬±    Z  L  0        superscript   subscript  W  L   plus-or-minus    superscript   subscript  Z  L   0     W_{L}^{\pm}Z_{L}^{0}   and     W  L  +    W  L  -        superscript   subscript  W  L      superscript   subscript  W  L       W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{-}   . At an expected mass of 1.5‚Äì2.0 TeV and width of 300‚Äì400 GeV, such œÅ T 's would be difficult to discover at the LHC. A one-family model has a large number of physical technipions, with F = F EW / = 123 GeV. 64 There is a collection of correspondingly lower-mass color-singlet and octet technivectors decaying into technipion pairs. The œÄ T 's are expected to decay to the heaviest possible quark and lepton pairs. Despite their lower masses, the œÅ T 's are wider than in the minimal model and the backgrounds to the œÄ T decays are likely to be insurmountable at a hadron collider.  This picture changed with the advent of walking technicolor. A walking gauge coupling occurs if Œ± œá SB lies just below the IR fixed point value Œ± IR , which requires either a large number of electroweak doublets in the fundamental representation of the gauge group, e.g., or a few doublets in higher-dimensional TC representations. 65 66 In the latter case, the constraints on ETC representations generally imply other technifermions in the fundamental representation as well. 67 68 In either case, there are technipions œÄ T with decay constant    F  ‚â™   F   E  W       much-less-than  F   subscript  F    E  W      F\ll F_{EW}   . This implies     Œõ   T  C    ‚â™   F   E  W       much-less-than   subscript  normal-Œõ    T  C     subscript  F    E  W      \Lambda_{TC}\ll F_{EW}   so that the lightest technivectors accessible at the LHC‚ÄîœÅ T , œâ T , a T (with I G  J PC = 1 + 1 ‚àí‚àí , 0 ‚àí 1 ‚àí‚àí , 1 ‚àí 1 ++ )‚Äîhave masses well below a TeV. The class of theories with many technifermions and thus    F  ‚â™   F   E  W       much-less-than  F   subscript  F    E  W      F\ll F_{EW}   is called low-scale technicolor. 69  A second consequence of walking technicolor concerns the decays of the spin-one technihadrons. Since technipion masses     M   œÄ  T   2   ‚àù    ‚ü®    T  ¬Ø   T   T  ¬Ø   T   ‚ü©    M   E  T  C        proportional-to   superscript   subscript  M   subscript  œÄ  T    2    subscript   delimited-‚ü®‚ü©     normal-¬Ø  T   T   normal-¬Ø  T   T     subscript  M    E  T  C       M_{\pi_{T}}^{2}\propto\langle\bar{T}T\bar{T}T\rangle_{M_{ETC}}   (see Eq. (4)), walking enhances them much more than it does other technihadron masses. Thus, it is very likely that the lightest M œÅ T œÄ T and that the two and three-œÄ T decay channels of the light technivectors are closed. 70 This further implies that these technivectors are very narrow. Their most probable two-body channels are     W  L   ¬±  ,  0     œÄ  T        subscript   superscript  W   plus-or-minus  0    L    subscript  œÄ  T     W^{\pm,0}_{L}\pi_{T}   , W L  W L , Œ≥ œÄ T and Œ≥ W L . The coupling of the lightest technivectors to W L is proportional to F/F EW . 71 Thus, all their decay rates are suppressed by powers of      (   F  /   F   E  W     )   2   ‚â™  1     much-less-than   superscript    F   subscript  F    E  W     2   1    (F/F_{EW})^{2}\ll 1   or the fine-structure constant, giving total widths of a few GeV (for œÅ T ) to a few tenths of a GeV (for œâ T and T ).  A more speculative consequence of walking technicolor is motivated by consideration of its contribution to the S -parameter. As noted above, the usual assumptions made to estimate S TC are invalid in a walking theory. In particular, the spectral integrals used to evaluate S TC cannot be dominated by just the lowest-lying œÅ T and a T and, if S TC is to be small, the masses and weak-current couplings of the œÅ T and a T could be more nearly equal than they are in QCD.  Low-scale technicolor phenomenology, including the possibility of a more parity-doubled spectrum, has been developed into a set of rules and decay amplitudes. 72 An April 2011 announcement of an excess in jet pairs produced in association with a W boson measured at the Tevatron 73 has been interpreted by Eichten, Lane and Martin as a possible signal of the technipion of low-scale technicolor. 74  The general scheme of low-scale technicolor makes little sense if the limit on    M   œÅ  T      subscript  M   subscript  œÅ  T     M_{\rho_{T}}   is pushed past about 700 GeV. The LHC should be able to discover it or rule it out. Searches there involving decays to technipions and thence to heavy quark jets are hampered by backgrounds from     t  ¬Ø   t       normal-¬Ø  t   t    \bar{t}t   production; its rate is 100 times larger than that at the Tevatron. Consequently, the discovery of low-scale technicolor at the LHC relies on all-leptonic final-state channels with favorable signal-to-background ratios     œÅ  T  ¬±   ‚Üí    W  L  ¬±    Z  L  0       normal-‚Üí   superscript   subscript  œÅ  T   plus-or-minus      superscript   subscript  W  L   plus-or-minus    superscript   subscript  Z  L   0      \rho_{T}^{\pm}\rightarrow W_{L}^{\pm}Z_{L}^{0}   ,     a  T  ¬±   ‚Üí   Œ≥   W  L  ¬±       normal-‚Üí   superscript   subscript  a  T   plus-or-minus     Œ≥   superscript   subscript  W  L   plus-or-minus      a_{T}^{\pm}\rightarrow\gamma W_{L}^{\pm}   and     œâ  T   ‚Üí   Œ≥   Z  L  0       normal-‚Üí   subscript  œâ  T     Œ≥   superscript   subscript  Z  L   0      \omega_{T}\rightarrow\gamma Z_{L}^{0}   . 75  Dark matter  Technicolor theories naturally contain dark matter candidates. Almost certainly, models can be built in which the lowest-lying technibaryon, a technicolor-singlet bound state of technifermions, is stable enough to survive the evolution of the universe. 76 77 If the technicolor theory is low-scale (    F  ‚â™   F   E  W       much-less-than  F   subscript  F    E  W      F\ll F_{EW}   ), the baryon's mass should be no more than 1‚Äì2 TeV. If not, it could be much heavier. The technibaryon must be electrically neutral and satisfy constraints on its abundance. Given the limits on spin-independent dark-matter-nucleon cross sections from dark-matter search experiments (     ‚â≤     10   -  42      cm  2       less-than-or-similar-to  absent     superscript  10    42     superscript  cm  2      \lesssim 10^{-42}\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}   for the masses of interest 78 ), it may have to be electroweak neutral (weak isospin I = 0) as well. These considerations suggest that the "old" technicolor dark matter candidates may be difficult to produce at the LHC.  A different class of technicolor dark matter candidates light enough to be accessible at the LHC was introduced by Francesco Sannino and his collaborators. 79 These states are pseudo Goldstone bosons possessing a global charge that makes them stable against decay.
