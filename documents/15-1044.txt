 , given the set T of nonnegative integers containing 0, is a function 
 
 
 
  of colors (positive integers) to the vertices of G such that if 
 
 
 
 .1 In simple words, the absolute value of the difference between two colors of adjacent vertices must not belong to fixed set T. The concept was introduced by William K. Hale.2 If T = {0} it reduces to common vertex coloring.
The complementary coloring of T-coloring c, denoted 
 
 
 
  is defined for each vertex v of G by


 where s is the largest color assigned to a vertex of G by the c function.3
T-chromatic number
The T-chromatic number

 
  is the minimum number of colors that can be used in a T-coloring of G. The T-chromatic number is equal to the chromatic number.

Proof
Every T-coloring of G is also a vertex coloring of G, so 
 
 
 
 . Suppose that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
 Given a common vertex k-coloring function 
 
 
 
  using the colors 1, 2,..,k. We define 
 
 
 
  as


 For every two adjacent vertices u and w of G,




 so 
 
 
 
 .
 Therefore d is a T-coloring of G. Since d uses k colors, 
 
 
 
 .
 Consequently, 
 
 

T-span
For a T-coloring c of G, the c-span spT(c) = max {|c(u)-c(w)|} over all uw

 
  V(G).
 The T-span spT(G) of G is min {spT(c)} of all colourings c of G. 5
 Some bounds of the T-span are given below:
 For every k-chromatic graph G with clique of size 
 
 
 
  and every finite set T of nonnegative integers containing 0, spT(K

)
 
 
spT(G) 
 
 
spT(Kk).
 For every graph G and every finite set T of nonnegative integers containing 0 whose largest element is r, spT(G) 
 
 
 
  (
 
 
 
 (G)-1)(r+1).

 For every graph G and every finite set T of nonnegative integers containing 0 whose cardinality is t, spT(G)
