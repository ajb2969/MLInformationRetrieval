   Draft:Harder–Narasimhan stratification      Draft:Harder–Narasimhan stratification   In algebraic geometry and complex geometry , the Harder–Narasimhan stratification is any of a stratification of the moduli stack of principal bundles by locally closed substacks in terms of "loci of instabilities". In the original form due to Harder and Narasimhan, G was the general linear group ; i.e., the moduli stack was the moduli stack of vector bundles, but, today, the term refers to any of generalizations. The scheme-theoretic version is due to Shatz and so the term "Shatz stratification" is also used synonymously. The general case is due to Behrend, 1 2  Definitions  Let X be a smooth projective curve over    𝐅  q     subscript  𝐅  q    \mathbf{F}_{q}   and G a smooth affine group scheme over    𝐅  q     subscript  𝐅  q    \mathbf{F}_{q}   whose fibers are connected and generic fiber is a semisimple group. Given a G -bundle P on X , the homomorphism     d   (  P  )    :    X   (  G  )    →  G      normal-:    d  P    normal-→    X  G   G     d(P):X(G)\to G   that maps a character   χ   χ   \chi   to the degree of the line bundle    P   ×   G  ,  χ     𝒪  X       subscript    G  χ    P   subscript  𝒪  X     P\times_{G,\chi}\mathcal{O}_{X}   is called the degree of   P   P   P   .  Let    Bun  G     subscript  Bun  G    \operatorname{Bun}_{G}   be the moduli stack of principal bundles on X , and    Bun  G  d     superscript   subscript  Bun  G   d    \operatorname{Bun}_{G}^{d}   locally closed substack consisting of bundles having degree    d  :    X   (  G  )    →  ℤ      normal-:  d   normal-→    X  G   ℤ     d:X(G)\to\mathbb{Z}   .
