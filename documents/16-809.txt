Draft:Harder–Narasimhan stratification

In algebraic geometry and complex geometry, the Harder–Narasimhan stratification is any of a stratification of the moduli stack of principal bundles by locally closed substacks in terms of "loci of instabilities". In the original form due to Harder and Narasimhan, G was the general linear group; i.e., the moduli stack was the moduli stack of vector bundles, but, today, the term refers to any of generalizations. The scheme-theoretic version is due to Shatz and so the term "Shatz stratification" is also used synonymously. The general case is due to Behrend,12
Definitions
Let X be a smooth projective curve over 
 
 
 
  and G a smooth affine group scheme over 
 
 
 
  whose fibers are connected and generic fiber is a semisimple group. Given a G-bundle P on X, the homomorphism 
 
 
 
  that maps a character 
 
 
 
  to the degree of the line bundle 
 
 
 
  is called the degree of 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be the moduli stack of principal bundles on X, and 
 
 
 
  locally closed substack consisting of bundles having degree 
 
 
 
 .
