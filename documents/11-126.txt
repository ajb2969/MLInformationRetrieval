   Tetrahydrofolate synthase      Tetrahydrofolate synthase   In enzymology , a tetrahydrofolate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + tetrahydropteroyl-[gamma-Glu]n + L-glutamate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + tetrahydropteroyl-[gamma-Glu]n + 1   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , [[tetrahydropteroyl-[gamma-Glu]n]], and L-glutamate , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and [[tetrahydropteroyl-[gamma-Glu]n+1]].  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds as acid-D-amino-acid ligases (peptide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is tetrahydropteroyl-gamma-polyglutamate:L-glutamate gamma-ligase (ADP-forming) . Other names in common use include folylpolyglutamate synthase , folate polyglutamate synthetase , formyltetrahydropteroyldiglutamate synthetase , N10-formyltetrahydropteroyldiglutamate synthetase , folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthase , folylpolyglutamyl synthetase , folylpoly(gamma-glutamate) synthase , folylpolyglutamate synthetase , folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase-dihydrofolate synthetase , FPGS , tetrahydrofolylpolyglutamate synthase , tetrahydrofolate:L-glutamate gamma-ligase (ADP-forming) , tetrahydropteroyl-[gamma-Glu]n:L-glutamate gamma-ligase , and (ADP-forming) . This enzyme participates in folate biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
