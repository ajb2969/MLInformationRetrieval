Projection (set theory)

In set theory, a projection is one of two closely related types of functions or operations, namely:

A set-theoretic operation typified by the jth projection map, written 
 
 
 
 , that takes an element 
 
 
 
  of the Cartesian product

 
  to the value 
 
 
 
 .1


A function that sends an element x to its equivalence class under a specified equivalence relation E,2 or, equivalently, a surjection from a set to another set.3 The function from elements to equivalence classes is a surjection, and every surjection corresponds to an equivalence relation under which two elements are equivalent when they have the same image. The result of the mapping is written as [x] when E is understood, or written as [x]E when it is necessary to make E explicit.
