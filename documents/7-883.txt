   Projection (set theory)      Projection (set theory)   In set theory , a projection is one of two closely related types of functions or operations, namely:   A set-theoretic operation typified by the j th projection map, written     proj  j      subscript  proj  j    \mathrm{proj}_{j}\!   , that takes an element     x  →   =   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  j   ,  …  ,   x  k   )        normal-→  x     subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  j   normal-…   subscript  x  k      \vec{x}=(x_{1},\ \ldots,\ x_{j},\ \ldots,\ x_{k})   of the Cartesian product     (    X  1   ×  ⋯  ×   X  j   ×  ⋯  ×   X  k    )       subscript  X  1   normal-⋯   subscript  X  j   normal-⋯   subscript  X  k     (X_{1}\times\cdots\times X_{j}\times\cdots\times X_{k})   to the value      proj  j    (   x  →   )    =   x  j          subscript  proj  j    normal-→  x     subscript  x  j     \mathrm{proj}_{j}(\vec{x})=x_{j}   . 1    A function that sends an element x to its equivalence class under a specified equivalence relation  E , 2 or, equivalently, a surjection from a set to another set. 3 The function from elements to equivalence classes is a surjection, and every surjection corresponds to an equivalence relation under which two elements are equivalent when they have the same image. The result of the mapping is written as [ x ] when E is understood, or written as [ x ] E when it is necessary to make E explicit.
