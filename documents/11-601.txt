ADP-ribosyl-(dinitrogen reductase) hydrolase




ADP-ribosyl-(dinitrogen reductase) hydrolase

In enzymology, an ADP-ribosyl-[dinitrogen reductase] hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ADP-D-ribosyl-[dinitrogen reductase] 
 
 
 
  ADP-D-ribose + [dinitrogen reductase]
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, ADP-D-ribosyl-[dinitrogen reductase], and two products, ADP-D-ribose and dinitrogen reductase.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those glycosylases that hydrolyse N-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ADP-D-ribosyl-[dinitrogen reductase] ADP-ribosylhydrolase. Other names in common use include azoferredoxin glycosidase, azoferredoxin-activating enzymes, dinitrogenase reductase-activating glycohydrolase, and ADP-ribosyl glycohydrolase.
