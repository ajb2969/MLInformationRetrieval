Sommerfeld expansion

A Sommerfeld expansion is an approximation method developed by Arnold Sommerfeld for a certain class of integrals which are common in condensed matter and statistical physics. Physically, the integrals represent statistical averages using the Fermi–Dirac distribution.
When the inverse temperature

 
  is a large quantity, the integral can be expanded12 in terms of 
 
 
 
  as



where 
 
 
 
  is used to denote the derivative of 
 
 
 
  evaluated at 
 
 
 
  and where the 
 
 
 
  notation refers to limiting behavior of order 
 
 
 
 . The expansion is only valid if 
 
 
 
  vanishes as 
 
 
 
  and goes no faster than polynomially in 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 .
Application to the free electron model
Integrals of this type appear frequently when calculating electronic properties in the free electron model of solids. In these calculations the above integral expresses the expected value of the quantity 
 
 
 
 . For these integrals we can then identify 
 
 
 
  as the inverse temperature and 
 
 
 
  as the chemical potential. Therefore, the Sommerfeld expansion is valid for large 
 
 
 
  (low temperature) systems.
Derivation to second order in temperature
We seek an expansion that is second order in temperature, i.e., to 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the product of temperature and Boltzmann's constant. Begin with a change variables to 
 
 
 
 :



Divide the range of integration, 
 
 
 
 , and rewrite 
 
 
 
  using the change of variables 
 
 
 
 :






Next, employ an algebraic 'trick' on the denominator of 
 
 
 
 ,



to obtain:



Return to the original variables with 
 
 
 
  in the first term of 
 
 
 
 . Combine 
 
 
 
  to obtain:



The numerator in the second term can be expressed as an approximation to the first derivative, provided 
 
 
 
  is sufficiently small and 
 
 
 
  is sufficiently smooth:



to obtain,



The definite integral is known3 to be:


 
 .
Hence,
