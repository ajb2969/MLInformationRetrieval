UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamate—D-lysine ligase

UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamate—D-lysine ligase (, UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu:D-Lys ligase, D-lysine-adding enzyme) is an enzyme with system name UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamate:D-lysine alpha-ligase (ADP-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ATP + UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamate + D-lysine 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-D-lysine
 

The enzyme from Thermotoga maritima also performs the reaction of EC 6.3.2.7.
