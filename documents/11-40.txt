Adenosylcobyric acid synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing)




Adenosylcobyric acid synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing)

In enzymology, an adenosylcobyric acid synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4 ATP + adenosylcobyrinic acid a,c-diamide + 4 L-glutamine + 4 H2O 
 
 
 
  4 ADP + 4 phosphate + adenosylcobyric acid + 4 L-glutamate
 

The 4 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, adenosylcobyrinic acid a,c-diamide, L-glutamine, and H2O, whereas its 4 products are ADP, phosphate, adenosylcobyric acid, and L-glutamate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds carbon-nitrogen ligases with glutamine as amido-N-donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is adenosylcobyrinic-acid-a,c-diamide:L-glutamine amido-ligase (ADP-forming). Other names in common use include CobQ, cobyric acid synthase, 5'-deoxy-5'-adenosylcobyrinic-acid-a,c-diamide:L-glutamine, amido-ligase, and Ado-cobyric acid synthase [glutamine hydrolyzing]. This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.
