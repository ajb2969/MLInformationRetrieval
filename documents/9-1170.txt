   Weitzenböck's inequality      Weitzenböck's inequality   In mathematics , Weitzenböck's inequality , named after Roland Weitzenböck , states that for a triangle of side lengths   a   a   a   ,   b   b   b   ,   c   c   c   , and area   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   , the following inequality holds:         a  2   +   b  2   +   c  2    ≥   4    3    Δ    .         superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2    superscript  c  2      4    3   normal-Δ     a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\geq 4\sqrt{3}\,\Delta.     Equality occurs if and only if the triangle is equilateral. Pedoe's inequality is a generalization of Weitzenböck's inequality. The Hadwiger-Finsler inequality is a strengthened version of Weitzenböck's inequality.  Proofs  The proof of this inequality was set as a question in the International Mathematical Olympiad of 1961. Even so, the result is not too difficult to derive using Heron's formula for the area of a triangle:     Δ   normal-Δ   \displaystyle\Delta     First method  This method assumes no knowledge of inequalities except that all squares are nonnegative.         (    a  2   -   b  2    )   2   +    (    b  2   -   c  2    )   2   +    (    c  2   -   a  2    )   2    ≥  0         superscript     superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2    2    superscript     superscript  b  2    superscript  c  2    2    superscript     superscript  c  2    superscript  a  2    2    0    \displaystyle(a^{2}-b^{2})^{2}+(b^{2}-c^{2})^{2}+(c^{2}-a^{2})^{2}\geq 0     and the result follows immediately by taking the positive square root of both sides. From the first inequality we can also see that equality occurs only when    a  =  b  =  c        a  b       c     a=b=c   and the triangle is equilateral.  Second method  This proof assumes knowledge of the rearrangement inequality and the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality .       a  2   +   b  2   +   c  2        superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2    superscript  c  2     \displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}     As we have used the rearrangement inequality and the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality, equality only occurs when    a  =  b  =  c        a  b       c     a=b=c   and the triangle is equilateral.  Third method  It can be shown that the area of the inner Napoleon's triangle , which must be nonnegative, is 1         3   24    (     a  2   +   b  2   +   c  2    -   4   3   Δ    )    ,          3   24        superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2    superscript  c  2      4    3   normal-Δ      \frac{\sqrt{3}}{24}(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}-4\sqrt{3}\Delta),     so the expression in parentheses must be greater than or equal to 0.
