   Bloch's principle      Bloch's principle   Bloch's Principle is a philosophical principle in mathematics stated by André Bloch . 1  Bloch states the principle in Latin as: Nihil est in infinito quod non prius fuerit in finito, and explains this as follows: Every proposition in whose statement the actual infinity occurs can be always considered a consequence, almost immediate, of a proposition where it does not occur, a proposition in finite terms .  Bloch mainly applied this principle to the theory of functions of a complex variable . Thus, for example, according to this principle, Picard's theorem corresponds to Schottky's theorem , and Valiron's theorem corresponds to Bloch's theorem .  Based on his Principle, Bloch was able to predict or conjecture several important results such as the Ahlfors's Five Islands theorem , Cartan 's theorem on holomorphic curves omitting hyperplanes, 2  Hayman 's result that an exceptional set of radii is unavoidable in Nevanlinna theory .  In the more recent times several general theorems were proved which can be regarded as rigorous statements in the spirit of the Bloch Principle.  Zalcman's lemma  Let    {   f  n   }      subscript  f  n     \{f_{n}\}   be a sequence of meromorphic functions in a region D , which is not a normal family . Then there exist a sequence of points    z  n     subscript  z  n    z_{n}   in D and positive numbers    ρ  n     subscript  ρ  n    \rho_{n}   with      lim   n  →  ∞     ρ  n    =  0        subscript    normal-→  n      subscript  ρ  n    0    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\rho_{n}=0   such that         f  n    (    z  n   +    ρ  n   z    )    →  f   ,     normal-→     subscript  f  n      subscript  z  n      subscript  ρ  n   z     f    f_{n}(z_{n}+\rho_{n}z)\to f,\,     where f is a non-constant meromorphic function in the complex plane. 3  Brody's lemma  Let X be a compact  complex analytic manifold , such that every holomorphic map from the complex plane to X is constant. Then there exists a metric on X such that every holomorphic map from the unit disc with the Poincaré metric to X does not increase distances. 4  References    "  Category:Mathematical principles  Category:Philosophy of mathematics     ↩  ↩  ↩  Lang (1987). ↩
