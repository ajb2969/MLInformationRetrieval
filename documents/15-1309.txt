TRNA (guanine10-N2)-dimethyltransferase

TRNA (guanine10-N2)-dimethyltransferase (, PAB1283, N(2),N(2)-dimethylguanosine tRNA methyltransferase, Trm-G10, PabTrm-G10, PabTrm-m2 2G10 enzyme) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanine10-N2)-dimethyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine10 in tRNA 
 
 
 
  2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N2-dimethylguanine10 in tRNA (overall reaction)
 
(1a) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine10 in tRNA 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N2-methylguanine10 in tRNA
 
(1b) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + N2-methylguanine10 in tRNA
