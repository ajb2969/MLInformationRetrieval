   Glutamate 5-kinase      Glutamate 5-kinase   In enzymology , a glutamate 5-kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-glutamate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + L-glutamate 5-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and L-glutamate , whereas its two products are ADP and L-glutamate 5-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with a carboxy group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:L-glutamate 5-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include ATP-L-glutamate 5-phosphotransferase , ATP:gamma-L-glutamate phosphotransferase , gamma-glutamate kinase , gamma-glutamyl kinase , and glutamate kinase . This enzyme participates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
