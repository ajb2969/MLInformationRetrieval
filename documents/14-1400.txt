Indifference price

In finance, indifference pricing is a method of pricing financial securities with regard to a utility function. The ' indifference price' is also known as the reservation price or private valuation. In particular, the indifference price is the price at which an agent would have the same expected utility level by exercising a financial transaction as by not doing so (with optimal trading otherwise). Typically the indifference price is a pricing range (a bid-ask spread) for a specific agent; this price range is an example of good-deal bounds.1
Mathematics
Given a utility function 
 
 
 
  and a claim 
 
 
 
  with known payoffs at some terminal time 
 
 
 
 . If we let the function 
 
 
 
  be defined by


 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the initial endowment, 
 
 
 
  is the set of all self-financing portfolios at time 
 
 
 
  starting with endowment 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the number of the claim to be purchased (or sold). Then the indifference bid price 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  units of 
 
 
 
  is the solution of 
 
 
 
  and the indifference ask price 
 
 
 
  is the solution of 
 
 
 
 . The indifference price bound is the range

Example
Consider a market with a risk free asset 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and a risky asset 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  each with probability 
 
 
 
 . Let your utility function be given by 
 
 
 
 . To find either the bid or ask indifference price for a single European call option with strike 110, first calculate 
 
 
 
 .

Which is maximized when 
 
 
 
 , therefore 
 
 
 
 .
Now to find the indifference bid price solve for 
 
 












Which is maximized when 
 
 
 
 , therefore 
 
 
 
 .
Therefore 
 
 
 
  when 
 
 
 
 .
Similarly solve for 
 
 
 
  to find the indifference ask price.
Notes

If 
 
 
 
  are the indifference price bounds for a claim then by definition 
 
 
 
 .3
If 
 
 
 
  is the indifference bid price for a claim and 
 
 
 
  are the superhedging price and subhedging prices respectively then 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, in a complete market the indifference price is always equal to the price to hedge the claim.
