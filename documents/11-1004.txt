   Formaldehyde transketolase      Formaldehyde transketolase   In enzymology , a formaldehyde transketolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-xylulose 5-phosphate + formaldehyde   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + glycerone   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-xylulose 5-phosphate and formaldehyde , whereas its two products are glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and glycerone .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring aldehyde or ketonic groups (transaldolases and transketolases, respectively). The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-xylulose-5-phosphate:formaldehyde glycolaldehydetransferase . This enzyme is also called dihydroxyacetone synthase . This enzyme participates in methane metabolism . It employs one cofactor , thiamin diphosphate .
