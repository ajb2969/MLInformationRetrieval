<p><strong>Transparent conducting films</strong> (TCFs) are optically transparent and <a href="electrical_conductivity" title="wikilink">electrically conductive</a> in thin layers. They are an important component of a number of electronic devices including <a href="Liquid-crystal_display" title="wikilink">Liquid-crystal displays</a>, <a class="uri" href="OLEDs" title="wikilink">OLEDs</a>, <a class="uri" href="touchscreens" title="wikilink">touchscreens</a> and <a class="uri" href="photovoltaics" title="wikilink">photovoltaics</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> While <a href="indium_tin_oxide" title="wikilink">indium tin oxide</a> (ITO) is the most widely used, alternatives including other transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), conductive polymers, metal grids, and <a href="carbon_nanotube" title="wikilink">carbon nanotube</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> (CNT), <a class="uri" href="graphene" title="wikilink">graphene</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and <a class="uri" href="nanowire" title="wikilink">nanowire</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> thin films all show promise in some applications.</p>

<p>TCFs for <a class="uri" href="photovoltaic" title="wikilink">photovoltaic</a> applications have been fabricated from both inorganic and organic materials. Inorganic films typically are made up of a layer of transparent conducting oxide (TCO),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> generally in the form of <a href="indium_tin_oxide" title="wikilink">indium tin oxide</a> (ITO), fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO), and doped <a href="zinc_oxide" title="wikilink">zinc oxide</a>. Organic films are being developed using <a href="carbon_nanotube" title="wikilink">carbon nanotube</a> networks and <a class="uri" href="graphene" title="wikilink">graphene</a>, which can be fabricated to be highly transparent to infrared light, along with networks of polymers such as <a class="uri" href="poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)" title="wikilink">poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)</a> and its derivatives.</p>

<p>Transparent conducting films act as a window for light to pass through to the active material beneath (where carrier generation occurs), as an ohmic contact for carrier transport out of the photovoltaic, and can also act as transparent carrier for <a href="surface-mount_technology" title="wikilink">surface mount devices</a> used between <a href="Ledglass" title="wikilink">laminated glass</a> or light transmissive <a href="LED_Headliner" title="wikilink">composites</a>. Transparent materials possess <a href="bandgap" title="wikilink">bandgaps</a> with energies corresponding to wavelengths which are shorter than the visible range of 380 nm to 750 nm. As such, photons with energies below the bandgap are not collected by these materials and thus visible light passes through. However, applications such as photovoltaics may require an even broader bandgap to avoid unwanted absorption of the solar spectra.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>Transparent conductive oxides (TCO) are doped metal oxides used in optoelectronic devices such as flat panel displays and photovoltaics (including inorganic devices, organic devices, and <a href="dye-sensitized_solar_cell" title="wikilink">dye-sensitized solar cell</a>). Most of these films are fabricated with <a class="uri" href="polycrystalline" title="wikilink">polycrystalline</a> or <a class="uri" href="amorphous" title="wikilink">amorphous</a> microstructures. On average, these applications use electrode materials that have greater than 80% transmittance of incident light as well as conductivities higher than 10<sup>3</sup> <a href="Siemens_(unit)" title="wikilink">S</a>/cm for efficient carrier transport. The transmittance of these films, just as in any <a href="transparent_material" title="wikilink">transparent material</a>, is limited by light scattering at defects and <a href="grain_boundaries" title="wikilink">grain boundaries</a>. In general, TCOs for use as thin-film electrodes in solar cells should have a minimum carrier concentration on the order of 10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> for low resistivity and a bandgap lower than 380 nm to avoid absorption of light over most of the solar spectra.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Mobility in these films is limited by ionized impurity scattering and is on the order of 40 cm<sup>2</sup>/(V·s). Current transparent conducting oxides used in industry are primarily n-type conductors, meaning their primary conduction is as donors of electrons. Suitable p-type transparent conducting oxides are still being researched.</p>

<p>To date, the industry standard in TCO is ITO, or <a href="indium_tin_oxide" title="wikilink">tin-doped indium-oxide</a>. This material boasts a low resistivity of ~10<sup>−4</sup> Ω·cm and a transmittance of greater than 80%. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> However ITO has the drawback of being expensive. <a class="uri" href="Indium" title="wikilink">Indium</a>, the film’s primary metal, is rare (6000 metric tons worldwide in 2006), and its price fluctuates due to market demand (over $800 per kg in 2006).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> For this reason, doped binary compounds such as <a href="aluminum-doped_zinc-oxide" title="wikilink">aluminum-doped zinc-oxide</a> (AZO) and indium-doped <a href="cadmium_oxide" title="wikilink">cadmium-oxide</a> have been proposed as alternative materials. AZO is composed of aluminum and zinc, two common and inexpensive materials, while indium-doped cadmium oxide only uses indium in low concentrations.</p>

<p>Binary compounds of metal oxides without any intentional impurity doping have also been developed for use as TCOs. These systems are typically n-type with a carrier concentration on the order of 10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>, provided by interstitial metal ions and oxygen vacancies which both act as donors. However, these simple TCOs have not found practical use due to the high dependence of their electrical properties on temperature and oxygen partial pressure.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="fabrication">Fabrication</h3>

<p>Doped metal oxides for use as transparent conducting layers in photovoltaic devices are typically grown on a <a class="uri" href="glass" title="wikilink">glass</a> substrate. This glass substrate, apart from providing a support that the oxide can grow on, has the additional benefit of blocking most infrared wavelengths greater than 2 µm for most silicates, and converting it to heat in the glass layer. This in turn helps maintain a low temperature of the active region of the solar cell, which degrades in performance as it heats up. TCO films can be deposited on a substrate through various deposition methods, including <a href="Metalorganic_vapour_phase_epitaxy" title="wikilink">metal organic chemical vapor deposition</a> (MOCVD), metal organic molecular beam deposition (MOMBD), spray pyrolysis, <a href="ultrasonic_nozzle" title="wikilink">ultrasonic nozzle</a> sprayed graphene oxide and air sprayed Ag Nanowire <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and <a href="pulsed_laser_deposition" title="wikilink">pulsed laser deposition</a> (PLD), however conventional fabrication techniques typically involve magnetron <a class="uri" href="sputtering" title="wikilink">sputtering</a> of the film. The sputtering process is very inefficient, with only 30% of planar target material available for deposition on the substrate. Cylindrical targets offer closer to 80% utilization. In the case of ITO recycling of unused target material is required for economic production. For AZO or ZnAl sputtering target material is sufficiently inexpensive that recovery of materials use is of no concern. There is some concern that there is a physical limit to the available indium for ITO<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Growth typically is performed in a reducing environment to encourage oxygen vacancy formation within the film, which contribute to the carrier concentration (if n-type).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>For azo thin film deposition, the coating method of reactive magnetron sputtering is a very economical and practical way of mass production. Compared to MOCVD and other methods, metal alloy cylinder target is very reliably supplied and low priced.</p>
<h3 id="theory">Theory</h3>

<p>Charge carriers in these oxides arise from three fundamental sources: interstitial metal ion impurities, oxygen vacancies, and doping ions. The first two sources always act as electron donors; indeed, some TCOs are fabricated solely using these two intrinsic sources as carrier generators. When an oxygen vacancy is present in the lattice it acts as a doubly charged electron donor. In ITO, for example, each oxygen vacancy causes the neighboring In<sup>3+</sup> ion 5s orbitals to be stabilized from the 5s conduction band by the missing bonds to the oxygen ion, while two electrons are trapped at the site due to charge neutrality effects. This stabilization of the 5s orbitals causes a formation of a donor level for the oxygen ion, determined to be 0.03 eV below the conduction band.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Thus these defects act as shallow donors to the bulk crystal. Common notation for this doping is <a href="Kröger–Vink_notation" title="wikilink">Kröger–Vink notation</a> and is written as:</p>

<p>Here “O” in the subscripts indicates that both the initially bonded oxygen and the vacancy that is produced lie on an oxygen lattice site, while the superscripts on the oxygen and vacancy indicate charge. Thus to enhance their electrical properties, ITO films and other transparent conducting oxides are grown in reducing environments, which encourage oxygen vacancy formation.</p>

<p>Dopant ionization within the oxide occurs in the same way as in other semiconductor crystals. Shallow donors near the conduction band (n-type) allow electrons to be thermally excited into the conduction band, while acceptors near the valence band (p-type) allow electrons to jump from the valence band to the acceptor level, populating the valence band with holes. It is important to note that carrier scattering in these oxides arises primarily from ionized impurity scattering. Charged impurity ions and point defects have scattering cross-sections that are much greater than their neutral counterparts. Increasing the scattering decreases the mean-free path of the carriers in the oxide, which leads to poor device performance and a high resistivity. These materials can be modeled reasonably well by the <a href="free_electron_gas" title="wikilink">free electron gas</a> theory assuming a parabolic conduction band and doping levels above the <a href="Mott_Criterion" title="wikilink">Mott Criterion</a>. This criterion states that an insulator such as an oxide can experience a composition-induced transition to a metallic state given a minimum doping concentration n<sub>c</sub>, determined by:</p>

<p>The bandgap of PEDOT can be varied between 1.4 and 2.5 eV by varying the degree of π-overlap along the backbone.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> This can be done by adding substituents along the chain, which result in steric interactions preventing π-overlap.

<h2 id="carbon-nanotubes">Carbon nanotubes</h2>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>

<p>Transparent conductors are fragile and tend to break down due to fatigue. The most commonly used TCO is Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) because of its good electrical properties and ease of fabrication. However, these thin films are usually fragile and such problems as lattice mismatch and stress-strain constraints lead to restrictions in possible uses for TCFs. ITO has been shown to degrade with time when subject to mechanical stresses. Recent increases in cost are also forcing many to look to carbon nanotube films as a potential alternative.</p>

<p><a href="Carbon_nanotubes" title="wikilink">Carbon nanotubes</a> (CNTs) have attracted much attention because of their materials properties, including a high elastic modulus (~1–2 TPa), a high tensile strength (~13–53 GPa), and a high conductivity (metallic tubes can theoretically carry an electric current density of 4×10<sup>9</sup> A/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is ~1000 times higher than for other metals such as <a class="uri" href="copper" title="wikilink">copper</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> CNT thin films have been used as transparent electrodes in TCFs because of these good electronic properties.</p>
<h3 id="preparation-of-cnt-thin-films">Preparation of CNT thin films</h3>

<p> The preparation of CNT <a href="thin_films" title="wikilink">thin films</a> for TCFs is composed of three steps: the CNT growth process, putting the CNTs in solution, and, finally, creation of the CNT thin film. Nanotubes can be grown using <a href="laser_ablation" title="wikilink">laser ablation</a>, electric-arc discharge, or different forms of <a href="chemical_vapor_deposition" title="wikilink">chemical vapor deposition</a> (such as PECVD). However, nanotubes are grown en-masse, with nanotubes of different chiralities stuck together due to <a href="Van_der_Waals_force" title="wikilink">van der Waals attraction</a>. Density gradient ultracentrifugation (DGU) has recently been used to get rid of this problem.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Using DGU, transparent conductors were constructed using only metallic tubes. Because DGU allows for separation by density, tubes with similar optical properties (due to similar diameters) were selected and used to make CNT conductive films of different colors.</p>

<p>In order to separate the grown tubes, the CNTs are mixed with surfactant and water and sonicated until satisfactory separation occurs. This solution is then sprayed onto the desired substrate in order to create a CNT thin film. The film is then rinsed in water in order to get rid of excess surfactant.</p>

<p>One method of spray deposition used for CNT film creation is a <a href="ultrasonic_nozzle" title="wikilink">ultrasonic nozzle</a> to atomize CNTs in solution to form PEDOT layers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>By optimizing spray parameters, including surfactant, drop size (dictated by the ultrasonic nozzle frequency) and solution flow rate, sheet resistance characteristics can be tuned. Due to the ultrasonic vibration of the nozzle itself, this method also provides an additional level of sonification during the spray process for added separation of agglomerated CNTs.</p>

<p>CNTs can also be used in addition to transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) in <a href="Thin-film_photovoltaic_cell" title="wikilink">thin-film photovoltaic devices</a>. Two TCOs which are often used are ZnO/Al and In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Sn <a href="indium_tin_oxide" title="wikilink">indium tin oxide</a> (ITO). PV devices made with these TCOs attained energy-conversion efficiencies of 19.5% in CuIn<sub>1−x</sub>Ga<sub>x</sub>Se<sub>2</sub>-based (<a href="Copper_indium_gallium_selenide" title="wikilink">CIGS</a>) solar cells and 16.5% in <a href="Cadmium_telluride" title="wikilink">CdTe</a>-based solar cells. These photovoltaic devices had much higher efficiencies compared to the devices made with CNT thin films: Britz <em>et al.</em> report an efficiency of 8%, with an open circuit voltage (V<sub>oc</sub>) of 0.676 V, a short circuit flux (J<sub>sc</sub>) of 23.9 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, and a fill factor of 45.48%.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> However, CNT thin films show many advantages over other transparent electrodes in the IR range. CNT thin films were reported to have a transmittance of over 90% in this range (400 nm – 22 µm). This paves the way for new applications, indicating that CNT thin films can be used as heat dissipaters in solar cells because of this high transmittance.</p>

<p>As stated previously, nanotube chirality is important in helping determine its potential aid to these devices. Before mass production can occur, more research is needed in exploring the significance of tube diameter and chirality for transparent conducting films in photovoltaic applications. It is expected that the conductivity of the SWNT thin films will increase with an increase in CNT length and purity. As stated previously, the CNT films are made using randomly oriented bundles of CNTs. Ordering these tubes should also increase conductivity, as it will minimize scattering losses and improve contact between the nanotubes.</p>
