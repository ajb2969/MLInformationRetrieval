   DTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-galactose acyltransferase      DTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-galactose acyltransferase   DTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-galactose acyltransferase (, TDP-fucosamine acetyltransferase , WECD , RFFC ) is an enzyme with system name acetyl-CoA:dTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactose N-acetyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + dTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + dTDP-4-acetamido-4,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactose   TDP-4-acetamido-4,6-dideoxy-D-galactose takes part in the biosynthesis of enterobacterial common antigen .
