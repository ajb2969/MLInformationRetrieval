   Recursive ordinal      Recursive ordinal   In mathematics , specifically set theory , an ordinal    α   α   \alpha   is said to be recursive if there is a recursive  well-ordering of a subset of the natural numbers having the order type    α   α   \alpha   .  It is trivial to check that   ω   ω   \omega   is recursive, the successor of a recursive ordinal is recursive, and the set of all recursive ordinals is closed downwards. The supremum of all recursive ordinals is called the Church-Kleene ordinal and denoted by    ω  1   C  K      subscript   superscript  ω    C  K    1    \omega^{CK}_{1}   . Indeed, an ordinal is recursive if and only if it is smaller than    ω  1   C  K      subscript   superscript  ω    C  K    1    \omega^{CK}_{1}   . Since there are only countably many recursive relations, there are also only countably many recursive ordinals. Thus,    ω  1   C  K      subscript   superscript  ω    C  K    1    \omega^{CK}_{1}   is countable.  The recursive ordinals are exactly the ordinals that have an ordinal notation in Kleene's   𝒪   𝒪   \mathcal{O}    .
