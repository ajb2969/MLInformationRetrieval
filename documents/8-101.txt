Recursive ordinal

In mathematics, specifically set theory, an ordinal

 
  is said to be recursive if there is a recursive well-ordering of a subset of the natural numbers having the order type

 
 .
It is trivial to check that 
 
 
 
  is recursive, the successor of a recursive ordinal is recursive, and the set of all recursive ordinals is closed downwards. The supremum of all recursive ordinals is called the Church-Kleene ordinal and denoted by 
 
 
 
 . Indeed, an ordinal is recursive if and only if it is smaller than 
 
 
 
 . Since there are only countably many recursive relations, there are also only countably many recursive ordinals. Thus, 
 
 
 
  is countable.
The recursive ordinals are exactly the ordinals that have an ordinal notation in Kleene's 
 
 
.
