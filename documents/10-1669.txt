maleate 
 
 
 
  fumarate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, maleate, and one product, fumarate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically cis-trans isomerases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is maleate cis-trans-isomerase. This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism.
