   Discontinuous-constituent phrase structure grammar      Discontinuous-constituent phrase structure grammar   Discontinuous-constituent Phrase Structure Grammar (DCPSG) (distinct from Discontinuous Phrase Structure Grammar/DPSG) is a formalism for describing discontinuous phrase structures in natural language, such as verb phrases in VSO languages. The formalism was introduced in the slightly more constrained form of Discontinuous-constituent Phrase Structure Grammar with Subscripts and Deletes (DCPSGsd) in Harman (1963). 1 DCPSGs describe a superset of the context-free languages, by means of rewrite rules that permit a limited amount of wrapping, similar to that found in Head grammar .  Description  Re''write rules of a DCPSG are identical to those of a CFG, with the addition of a meta-symbol, denoted here as an underscore. DCPSG rules therefore have the general form    X  →  α     normal-→  X  α    X\to\alpha   where   α   α   \alpha   is a string of terminal symbols and/or non-terminal symbols and at most one underscore.  The rewrite semantics of DCPSG are identical as those of a CFG when the rule being used does not contain an underscore: given a rule    X  →  α     normal-→  X  α    X\to\alpha   , an occurrence of   X   X   X   may be rewritten as   α   α   \alpha   .  For rules with an underscore, the rewrite semantics are slightly different: given a rule    X  →   α  _  β      normal-→  X    α  normal-_  β     X\to\alpha\_\beta   , an occurrence of   X   X   X   can be rewritten as   α   α   \alpha   , with   β   β   \beta   being inserted immediately after the next non-terminal that is introduced at the same time. Using strict left-most productions,   β   β   \beta   is simply inserted immediately after the non-terminal that follows   X   X   X   prior to the rewrite. ''  Example  We can characterize the gross sentence structure of a VSO language such as Irish with the following rules (substituting English words for Irish words, and using subscripts solely for demonstration of discontinuity):      S  →   V   P   N   P   s  u  b  j        normal-→  S    V  P  N   subscript  P    s  u  b  j       S\to VP\ NP_{subj}       V  P  →  I  T   V   |  T   V    _   N   P   o  b  j       fragments  V  P  normal-→  I  T  V  normal-|  T  V  _  N   subscript  P    o  b  j      VP\to ITV~{}|~{}TV\ \_\ NP_{obj}        N  P   →   J  o  h   n    |   S  u  s  a   n    |   …      normal-→    N  P     J  o  h  n      S  u  s  a  n    normal-…     NP\to John~{}|~{}Susan~{}|~{}...
