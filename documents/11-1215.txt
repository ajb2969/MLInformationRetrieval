Beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase




Beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase

In enzymology, a beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

CMP-N-acetylneuraminate + beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine 
 
 
 
  CMP + alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl-2,6-beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-N-acetyl-beta-D- glucosamine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CMP-N-acetylneuraminate and beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, whereas its 3 products are CMP, alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl-2,6-beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-N-acetyl-beta-D-, and glucosamine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those glycosyltransferases that do not transfer hexosyl or pentosyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CMP-N-acetylneuraminate:beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucos amine alpha-2,6-N-acetylneuraminyltransferase. This enzyme participates in n-glycan biosynthesis and glycan structures - biosynthesis 1.
