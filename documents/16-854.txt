   Fifth-order Korteweg–de Vries equation      Fifth-order Korteweg–de Vries equation   A fifth-order Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation in 1+1 dimensions related to the Korteweg–de Vries equation . 1 Fifth order KdV equations may be used to model dispersive phenomena such as plasma waves when the third-order contributions are small. The term may refer to equations of the form        u  t   +   α   u   x  x  x     +   β   u   x  x  x  x  x      =    ∂   ∂  x    f   (  u  ,   u  x   ,   u   x  x    )           subscript  u  t     α   subscript  u    x  x  x       β   subscript  u    x  x  x  x  x             x    f   u   subscript  u  x    subscript  u    x  x        u_{t}+\alpha u_{xxx}+\beta u_{xxxxx}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}f(u,u_{x},u_{%
 xx})     where   f   f   f   is a smooth function and   α   α   \alpha   and   β   β   \beta   are real with    β  ≠  0      β  0    \beta\neq 0   . Unlike the KdV system, it is not integrable. It admits a great variety of soliton solutions. 2   References    "  Category:Nonlinear partial differential equations     Andrei D. Polyanin, Valentin F.
