Fifth-order Korteweg–de Vries equation

A fifth-order Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation in 1+1 dimensions related to the Korteweg–de Vries equation.1 Fifth order KdV equations may be used to model dispersive phenomena such as plasma waves when the third-order contributions are small. The term may refer to equations of the form



where 
 
 
 
  is a smooth function and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are real with 
 
 
 
 . Unlike the KdV system, it is not integrable. It admits a great variety of soliton solutions.2
