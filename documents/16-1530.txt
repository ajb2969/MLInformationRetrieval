Draft:Krein space

In mathematics, a Krein space is a type of indefinite inner product space. The inner product of a Krein space is the difference of two positive definite inner products. Krein spaces are named in honor of the Ukrainian mathematician Mark Grigorievich Krein (3 April 1907 â€“ 17 October 1989).
Definition
In this article, the field of scalars denoted 
 
 
 
  is either the field of real numbers

 
  or the field of complex numbers

 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be a vector space over the field 
 
 
 
 . A (not necessarily positive definite) inner product over 
 
 
 
  is a map



that satisfies the following three axioms for all vectors 
 
 
 
  and all scalars 
 
 


Conjugate symmetry:








Note that when 
 
 
 
 , conjugate symmetry reduces to symmetry. That is, 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 ; while for 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is equal to the complex conjugate the complex conjugate of any Complex number 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . Often when dealing with Complex numbers the complex conjugate of a complex quantity 
 
 
 
  is symbolized by 
 
 
 
 .
 


Linearity in the first argument:











Together with conjugate symmetry, this implies conjugate linearity in the second argument.
 


Nondegeneracy:








Note that another definition of inner product replaces nondegeneracy by the positive definiteness condition 
 
 
 
 .
 

A vector space 
 
 
 
  equipped with the inner product 
 
 
 
  is called a Krein space if there are two Hilbert spaces 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with inner products 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  spanning 
 
 
 
  such that

All 
 
 
 
  can be decomposed as








where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
 


For all 
 
 
 
 ,









Note that any Hilbert space is a Krein space, which can be seen by taking
