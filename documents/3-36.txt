   Cunningham chain      Cunningham chain   In mathematics , a Cunningham chain is a certain sequence of prime numbers . Cunningham chains are named after mathematician  A. J. C. Cunningham . They are also called chains of nearly doubled primes .  Definition  A Cunningham chain of the first kind of length n is a sequence of prime numbers ( p 1 , ..., p n ) such that for all 1 ≤ i  i +1 = 2 p i + 1. (Hence each term of such a chain except the last one is a Sophie Germain prime , and each term except the first is a safe prime ).  It follows that  $$\begin{align}
 p_2 & = 2p_1+1, \\
 p_3 & = 4p_1+3, \\
 p_4 & = 8p_1+7, \\
 & {}\  \vdots \\
 p_i & = 2^{i-1}p_1 + (2^{i-1}-1).
 \end{align}$$  Or, by setting $a = \frac{p_1 + 1}{2}$ (the number $a$ is not part of the sequence and need not be a prime number), we have $p_i = 2^{i} a - 1$  Similarly, a Cunningham chain of the second kind of length n is a sequence of prime numbers ( p 1 ,..., p n ) such that for all 1 ≤ i  i +1 = 2 p i − 1.  It follows that the general term is  $$p_i = 2^{i-1}p_1 - (2^{i-1}-1) \,$$  Now, by setting $a = \frac{p_1 - 1}{2}$ , we have $p_i = 2^{i} a + 1$ .  Cunningham chains are also sometimes generalized to sequences of prime numbers ( p 1 , ..., p n ) such that for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n , p i +1 = ap i + b for fixed coprime  integers  a , b ; the resulting chains are called generalized Cunningham chains .  A Cunningham chain is called complete if it cannot be further extended, i.e., if the previous or next term in the chain would not be a prime number anymore.  Examples  Examples of complete Cunningham chains of the first kind include these:   2, 5, 11, 23, 47 (The next number would be 95, but that is not prime.)  3, 7 (The next number would be 15, but that is not prime.)  29, 59 (The next number would be 119 = 7*17, but that is not prime.)  41, 83, 167 (The next number would be 335, but that is not prime.)  89, 179, 359, 719, 1439, 2879 (The next number would be 5759 = 13*443, but that is not prime.)   Examples of complete Cunningham chains of the second kind include these:   2, 3, 5 (The next number would be 9, but that is not prime.)  7, 13 (The next number would be 25, but that is not prime.)  19, 37, 73 (The next number would be 145, but that is not prime.)  31, 61 (The next number would be 121 = 11 2 , but that is not prime.)  151, 301, 601, 1201 (The next number would be 2401 = 7 4 , but that is not prime.)   Cunningham chains are now considered useful in cryptographic systems since "they provide two concurrent suitable settings for the ElGamal cryptosystem ... [which] can be implemented in any field where the discrete logarithm problem is difficult." 1  Largest known Cunningham chains  It follows from Dickson's conjecture and the broader Schinzel's hypothesis H , both widely believed to be true, that for every k there are infinitely many Cunningham chains of length k . There are, however, no known direct methods of generating such chains.  There are computing competitions for the longest Cunningham chain or for the one built up of the largest primes, but unlike the breakthrough of Ben J. Green and Terence Tao - the Green–Tao theorem , that there are arithmetic progressions of primes of arbitrary length - there is no general result known on large Cunningham chains to date. A relevant open problem, Rassias' conjecture can be also stated in terms of Cunningham chains, namely: there exist Cunningham chains with parameters $2a, -1$ for $a$ such that $2a-1=p$ is a prime number.

The first prime is odd, thus $p_1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$ . Since each successive prime in the chain is $p_{i+1} = 2p_i + 1$ it follows that $p_i \equiv 2^i - 1 \pmod{2^i}$ . Thus, $p_2 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$ , $p_3 \equiv 7 \pmod{8}$ , and so forth.  The above property can be informally observed by considering the primes of a chain in base 2. (Note that, as with all bases, multiplying by the number of the base "shifts" the digits to the left.) When we consider $p_{i+1} = 2p_i + 1$ in base 2, we see that, by multiplying $p_i$ by 2, the least significant digit of $p_i$ becomes the secondmost least significant digit of $p_{i+1}$ . Because $p_i$ is odd—that is, the least significant digit is 1 in base 2--we know that the secondmost least significant digit of $p_{i+1}$ is also 1. And, finally, we can see that $p_{i+1}$ will be odd due to the addition of 1 to $2p_i$ . In this way, successive primes in a Cunningham chain are essentially shifted left in binary with ones filling in the least significant digits. For example, here is a complete length 6 chain which starts at 141361469:     Binary  Decimal      1000011011010000000100111101  141361469    10000110110100000001001111011  282722939    100001101101000000010011110111  565445879    1000011011010000000100111101111  1130891759    10000110110100000001001111011111  2261783519    100001101101000000010011110111111  4523567039     A similar result holds for Cunningham chains of the second kind. From the observation that $p_1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$ and the relation $p_{i+1} = 2 p_i - 1$ it follows that $p_i \equiv 1 \pmod{2^i}$ . In binary notation, the primes in a Cunningham chain of the second kind end with a pattern "0...01", where, for each $i$ , the number of zeros in the pattern for $p_{i+1}$ is one more than the number of zeros for $p_i$ . As with Cunningham chains of the first kind, the bits left of the pattern shift left by one position with each successive prime.  Similarly, because $p_i = 2^{i-1}p_1 + (2^{i-1}-1) \,$ it follows that $p_i \equiv 2^{i-1} - 1 \pmod{p_1}$ . But, by Fermat's little theorem , $2^{p_1-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p_1}$ , so $p_1$ divides $p_{p_1}$ (i.e. with $i = p_1$ ). Thus, no Cunningham chain can be of infinite length. 4  See also   Primecoin , which uses Cunningham chains as a proof-of-work system  Rassias' conjecture   References    External links   The Prime Glossary: Cunningham chain  PrimeLinks++: Cunningham chain  Sequence A005602 in OEIS : the first term of the lowest complete Cunningham chains of the first kind of length n , for 1 ≤ n ≤ 14  Sequence A005603 in OEIS : the first term of the lowest complete Cunningham chains of the second kind with length n , for 1 ≤ n ≤ 15   "  Category:Prime numbers     Joe Buhler, Algorithmic Number Theory: Third International Symposium, ANTS-III .
