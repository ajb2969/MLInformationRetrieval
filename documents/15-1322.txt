23S rRNA (cytidine1920-2'-O)-methyltransferase

23S rRNA (cytidine1920-2'-O)-methyltransferase (, TlyA) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (cytidine1920-2'-O)-methyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytidine1920 in 23S rRNA 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylcytidine1920 in 23S rRNA
 

This is a bifunctional enzyme from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
