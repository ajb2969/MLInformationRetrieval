   Paley–Wiener theorem      Paley–Wiener theorem   In mathematics , a Paley–Wiener theorem is any theorem that relates decay properties of a function or distribution at infinity with analyticity of its Fourier transform . The theorem is named for Raymond Paley (1907–1933) and Norbert Wiener (1894–1964). The original theorems did not use the language of distributions , and instead applied to square-integrable functions . The first such theorem using distributions was due to Laurent Schwartz .  Holomorphic Fourier transforms  The classical Paley–Wiener theorems make use of the holomorphic Fourier transform on classes of square-integrable functions supported on the real line. Formally, the idea is to take the integral defining the (inverse) Fourier transform       f   (  ζ  )    =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞    F   (  x  )     e   i  x  ζ     d  x          f  ζ     superscript   subscript            F  x   superscript  e    i  x  ζ    d  x      f(\zeta)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}F(x)e^{ix\zeta}\,dx     and allow ζ to be a complex number in the upper half-plane . One may then expect to differentiate under the integral in order to verify that the Cauchy–Riemann equations hold, and thus that f defines an analytic function. However, this integral may not be well-defined, even for F in L 2 ( R ) - indeed, since ζ is in the upper half plane, the modulus of e ixζ grows exponentially as x → -∞ - so differentiation under the integral sign is out of the question. One must impose further restrictions on F in order to ensure that this integral is well-defined.  The first such restriction is that F be supported on R + : that is, F ∈ L 2 ( R + ). The Paley–Wiener theorem now asserts the following: 1 The holomorphic Fourier transform of F , defined by       f   (  ζ  )    =    ∫  0  ∞    F   (  x  )     e   i  x  ζ     d  x          f  ζ     superscript   subscript   0       F  x   superscript  e    i  x  ζ    d  x      f(\zeta)=\int_{0}^{\infty}F(x)e^{ix\zeta}\,dx     for ζ in the upper half-plane is a holomorphic function. Moreover, by Plancherel's theorem , one has        ∫   -  ∞   ∞       |   f   (   ξ  +   i  η    )    |   2    d  ξ    ≤    ∫  0  ∞       |   F   (  x  )    |   2    d  x          superscript   subscript             superscript      f    ξ    i  η      2   d  ξ      superscript   subscript   0        superscript      F  x    2   d  x      \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left|f(\xi+i\eta)\right|^{2}\,d\xi\leq\int_{0}^{\infty%
 }|F(x)|^{2}\,dx     and by dominated convergence ,        lim   η  →   0  +       ∫   -  ∞   ∞       |    f   (   ξ  +   i  η    )    -   f   (  ξ  )     |   2    d  ξ     =  0.        subscript    normal-→  η   superscript  0        superscript   subscript             superscript        f    ξ    i  η       f  ξ     2   d  ξ     0.    \lim_{\eta\to 0^{+}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left|f(\xi+i\eta)-f(\xi)\right|^{2%
 }\,d\xi=0.     Conversely, if f is a holomorphic function in the upper half-plane satisfying        sup   η  >  0      ∫   -  ∞   ∞       |   f   (   ξ  +   i  η    )    |   2    d  ξ     =  C  <  ∞          subscript  supremum    η  0      superscript   subscript             superscript      f    ξ    i  η      2   d  ξ     C           \sup_{\eta>0}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left|f(\xi+i\eta)\right|^{2}\,d\xi=C<\infty     then there exists F in L 2 ( R + ) such that f is the holomorphic Fourier transform of F .  In abstract terms, this version of the theorem explicitly describes the Hardy space  H 2 ( R ) . The theorem states that        ℱ   H  2    (  𝐑  )    =    L  2    (   𝐑  +   )     .        ℱ   superscript  H  2   𝐑      superscript  L  2    subscript  𝐑       \mathcal{F}H^{2}(\mathbf{R})=L^{2}(\mathbf{R_{+}}).     This is a very useful result as it enables one pass to the Fourier transform of a function in the Hardy space and perform calculations in the easily understood space L 2 ( R + ) of square-integrable functions supported on the positive axis.  By imposing the alternative restriction that F be compactly supported , one obtains another Paley–Wiener theorem. 2 Suppose that F is supported in [− A , A ], so that F ∈ L 2 (− A , A ). Then the holomorphic Fourier transform       f   (  ζ  )    =    ∫   -  A   A    F   (  x  )     e   i  x  ζ     d  x          f  ζ     superscript   subscript     A    A     F  x   superscript  e    i  x  ζ    d  x      f(\zeta)=\int_{-A}^{A}F(x)e^{ix\zeta}\,dx     is an entire function of exponential type  A , meaning that there is a constant C such that        |   f   (  ζ  )    |   ≤   C   e   A   |  ζ  |       ,          f  ζ      C   superscript  e    A    ζ        |f(\zeta)|\leq Ce^{A|\zeta|},     and moreover, f is square-integrable over horizontal lines:         ∫   -  ∞   ∞       |   f   (   ξ  +   i  η    )    |   2    d  ξ    <  ∞   .        superscript   subscript             superscript      f    ξ    i  η      2   d  ξ       \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|f(\xi+i\eta)|^{2}\,d\xi<\infty.     Conversely, any entire function of exponential type A which is square-integrable over horizontal lines is the holomorphic Fourier transform of an L 2 function supported in [− A , A ].  Schwartz's Paley–Wiener theorem  Schwartz's Paley–Wiener theorem asserts that the Fourier transform of a distribution of compact support on R n is an entire function on C n and gives estimates on its growth at infinity. It was proven by Laurent Schwartz ( 1952 ). The formulation presented here is from .  Generally, the Fourier transform can be defined for any tempered distribution ; moreover, any distribution of compact support v is a tempered distribution. If v is a distribution of compact support and f is an infinitely differentiable function, the expression       v   (  f  )    =    v  x    (   f   (  x  )    )          v  f      subscript  v  x     f  x      v(f)=v_{x}(f(x))     is well defined. In the above expression the variable x in v x is a dummy variable and indicates that the distribution is to be applied with the argument function considered as a function of x .  It can be shown that the Fourier transform of v is a function (as opposed to a general tempered distribution) given at the value s by        v  ^    (  s  )    =     (   2  π   )    -   n  2      v  x    (   e   -   i   ⟨  x  ,  s  ⟩      )           normal-^  v   s      superscript    2  π       n  2      subscript  v  x    superscript  e      i   x  s         \hat{v}(s)=(2\pi)^{-\frac{n}{2}}v_{x}\left(e^{-i\langle x,s\rangle}\right)     and that this function can be extended to values of s in the complex space C n . This extension of the Fourier transform to the complex domain is called the Fourier–Laplace transform .   Schwartz's Theorem. An entire function F on C n is the Fourier–Laplace transform of distribution v of compact support if and only if for all z ∈ C n ,       |   F   (  z  )    |   ≤   C    (   1  +   |  z  |    )   N    e   B   |   Im   (  z  )    |              F  z      C   superscript    1    z    N    superscript  e    B      Im  z         |F(z)|\leq C(1+|z|)^{N}e^{B|\text{Im}(z)|}     for some constants C , N , B . The distribution v in fact will be supported in the closed ball of center 0 and radius B .   Additional growth conditions on the entire function F impose regularity properties on the distribution v . For instance: 3   Theorem. If for every positive N there is a constant C N such that for all z ∈ C n ,       |   F   (  z  )    |   ≤    C  N     (   1  +   |  z  |    )    -  N     e   B   |   Im   (  z  )    |              F  z       subscript  C  N    superscript    1    z      N     superscript  e    B      Im  z         |F(z)|\leq C_{N}(1+|z|)^{-N}e^{B|\text{Im}(z)|}     then v is infinitely differentiable, and conversely.   Sharper results giving good control over the singular support of v have been formulated by . In particular, 4 let K be a convex compact set in R n with supporting function H , defined by        H   (  x  )    =    sup   y  ∈  K     ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩     .        H  x     subscript  supremum    y  K     x  y      H(x)=\sup_{y\in K}\langle x,y\rangle.     Then the singular support of v is contained in K if and only if there is a constant N and sequence of constants C m such that       |    v  ^    (  ζ  )    |   ≤    C  m     (   1  +   |  ζ  |    )   N    e   H   (   Im   (  ζ  )    )               normal-^  v   ζ       subscript  C  m    superscript    1    ζ    N    superscript  e    H    Im  ζ        |\hat{v}(\zeta)|\leq C_{m}(1+|\zeta|)^{N}e^{H(\text{Im}(\zeta))}     for |Im(ζ)| ≤ m log(|ζ|+1).
