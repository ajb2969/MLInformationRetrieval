D-xylose reductase

D-xylose reductase (, XylR, XyrA, msXR, dsXR, monospecific xylose reductase, dual specific xylose reductase, NAD(P)H-dependent xylose reductase, xylose reductase) is an enzyme with system name xylitol:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase.12345678 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

xylitol + NAD(P)+

 
  D-xylose + NAD(P)H + H+


Xylose reductase catalyses the initial reaction in the xylose utilization pathway, the NAD(P)H dependent reduction of xylose to xylitol.
