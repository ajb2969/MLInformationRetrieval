   NADPH peroxidase      NADPH peroxidase   In enzymology , a NADPH peroxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   NADPH + H + + H 2 O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   NADP + + 2 H 2 O   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are NADPH , H + , and H 2 O 2 , whereas its two products are NADP + and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a peroxide as acceptor (peroxidases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is NADPH:hydrogen-peroxide oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include TPNH peroxidase , NADP peroxidase , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate peroxidase , TPN peroxidase , triphosphopyridine nucleotide peroxidase , and NADPH2 peroxidase .
