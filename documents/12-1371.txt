   Einasto profile      Einasto profile   The Einasto profile (or Einasto model ) is a mathematical function that describes how the density   ρ   ρ   \rho   of a spherical stellar system varies with distance   r   r   r   from its center. Jaan Einasto introduced his model at a 1963 conference in Alma-Ata , Kazakhstan. 1  The Einasto profile has the form        ρ   (  r  )    ∝   exp   (   -   A   r  α     )     .     proportional-to    ρ  r         A   superscript  r  α        \rho(r)\propto\exp{(-Ar^{\alpha})}.     The parameter   α   α   \alpha   controls the degree of curvature of the profile. This can be seen by computing the slope on a log-log plot:           d    (   log  ρ   )    /   d     (   log  r   )    ∝   -   r  α     .     proportional-to        d    ρ    d     r       superscript  r  α      d\ (\log\rho)/d\ (\log r)\propto-r^{\alpha}.     The larger   α   α   \alpha   , the more rapidly the slope varies with radius (see figure). Einasto's law can be described as a generalization of a power law,    ρ  ∝   r   -  N       proportional-to  ρ   superscript  r    N      \rho\propto r^{-N}   , which has a constant slope on a log-log plot.  Einasto's model has the same mathematical form as Sersic's law , which is used to describe the surface brightness (i.e. projected density) profile of galaxies.  Einasto's model has been used to describe many types of system, including galaxies 2 and dark matter halos . 3 {{-}}  References  External links   Spherical galaxy models with power-law logarithmic slope .
