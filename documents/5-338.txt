Loop algebra

In mathematics, loop algebras are certain types of Lie algebras, of particular interest in theoretical physics.
Definition
If 
 
 
 
  is a Lie algebra, the tensor product of 
 
 
 
  with , the algebra of (complex) smooth functions over the circle manifold ,


 
 ,
is an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra with the Lie bracket given by


 
 .
Here  and  are elements of 
 
 
 
  and  and  are elements of .
This isn't precisely what would correspond to the direct product of infinitely many copies of 
 
 
 
 , one for each point in , because of the smoothness restriction. Instead, it can be thought of in terms of smooth map from  to 
 
 
 
 ; a smooth parametrized loop in 
 
 
 
 , in other words. This is why it is called the loop algebra.
Loop group
Similarly, a set of all smooth maps from  to a Lie group

 
  forms an infinite-dimensional Lie group (Lie group in the sense we can define functional derivatives over it) called the loop group. The Lie algebra of a loop group is the corresponding loop algebra.
Fourier transform
We can take the Fourier transform on this loop algebra by defining



as



where

0 ≤ σ <2π
 

is a coordinatization of .
Applications
If 
 
 
 
  is a semisimple Lie algebra, then a nontrivial central extension of its loop algebra gives rise to an affine Kac–Moody algebra.
