   Loop algebra      Loop algebra   In mathematics , loop algebras are certain types of Lie algebras , of particular interest in theoretical physics .  Definition  If   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   is a Lie algebra, the tensor product of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   with , the algebra of (complex) smooth functions over the circle  manifold  ,       𝔤  ⊗   C  ∞     (   S  1   )        tensor-product  𝔤   superscript  C      superscript  S  1     \mathfrak{g}\otimes C^{\infty}(S^{1})   ,  is an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra with the Lie bracket given by       [    g  1   ⊗   f  1    ,    g  2   ⊗   f  2    ]   =     [   g  1   ,   g  2   ]   ⊗   f  1     f  2          tensor-product   subscript  g  1    subscript  f  1     tensor-product   subscript  g  2    subscript  f  2        tensor-product    subscript  g  1    subscript  g  2     subscript  f  1     subscript  f  2      [g_{1}\otimes f_{1},g_{2}\otimes f_{2}]=[g_{1},g_{2}]\otimes f_{1}f_{2}   .  Here and are elements of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   and and are elements of .  This isn't precisely what would correspond to the direct product of infinitely many copies of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   , one for each point in , because of the smoothness restriction. Instead, it can be thought of in terms of smooth map from to   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   ; a smooth parametrized loop in   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   , in other words. This is why it is called the loop algebra .  Loop group  Similarly, a set of all smooth maps from to a Lie group    G   G   G   forms an infinite-dimensional Lie group (Lie group in the sense we can define functional derivatives over it) called the loop group . The Lie algebra of a loop group is the corresponding loop algebra.  Fourier transform  We can take the Fourier transform on this loop algebra by defining      g  ⊗   t  n      tensor-product  g   superscript  t  n     g\otimes t^{n}     as      g  ⊗   e   -   i  n  σ        tensor-product  g   superscript  e      i  n  σ       g\otimes e^{-in\sigma}     where   0 ≤ σ <2π   is a coordinatization of .  Applications  If   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   is a semisimple Lie algebra , then a nontrivial central extension of its loop algebra gives rise to an affine Kac–Moody algebra .
