   Forecast skill      Forecast skill   Skill in forecasting (or skill score , 1  forecast skill , prediction skill ) is a scaled representation of forecast error that relates the forecast accuracy of a particular forecast model to some reference model.      Mean squared error (MSE)        𝑀𝑆𝐸   =      ∑   t  =  1   N     E  t  2    N       𝑀𝑆𝐸      superscript   subscript     t  1    N    superscript   subscript  E  t   2    N     \ \mathit{MSE}=\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{N}{E_{t}^{2}}}{N}        Forecast skill (SS)        𝑆𝑆   =   1  -    𝑀𝑆𝐸  forecast    𝑀𝑆𝐸  ref         𝑆𝑆    1     subscript  𝑀𝑆𝐸  forecast    subscript  𝑀𝑆𝐸  ref       \ \mathit{SS}=1-\frac{\mathit{MSE}_{\text{forecast}}}{\mathit{MSE}_{\text{ref}}}        A perfect forecast results in a forecast skill of 1.0, a forecast with similar skill to the reference forecast would have a skill of 0.0, and a forecast which is less skillful than the reference forecast would have negative skill values. 2 3  References  "  Category:Statistical forecasting  Category:Climate and weather statistics  Category:Weather forecasting     Glossary of Meteorology, American Meteorological Society ↩  ↩  ↩
