== Summary ==
The Lax-Friedrichs solution at time 
 
 
 
  for the illustration problem in the Laxâ€“Friedrichs method article modified to have periodic boundary conditions with the discontinuous initial condition shown in the article. With the choice of 
 
 
 
 , the exact solution at time 
 
 
 
  is identical to the initial condition:

Thus this solution displays both dispersion and dissipation error.
