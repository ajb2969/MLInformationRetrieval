   Admissible ordinal      Admissible ordinal   In set theory , an ordinal number α is an admissible ordinal if L α is an admissible set (that is, a transitive model of Kripke–Platek set theory ); in other words, α is admissible when α is a limit ordinal and L α ⊧Σ 0 -collection. 1 2  The first two admissible ordinals are ω and    ω  1  CK     superscript   subscript  ω  1   CK    \omega_{1}^{\mathrm{CK}}   (the least non-recursive ordinal , also called the Church–Kleene ordinal ). 3 Any regular uncountable cardinal is an admissible ordinal.  By a theorem of Sacks , the countable admissible ordinals are exactly those constructed in a manner similar to the Church-Kleene ordinal, but for Turing machines with oracles . 4 One sometimes writes    ω  α  CK     superscript   subscript  ω  α   CK    \omega_{\alpha}^{\mathrm{CK}}   for the   α   α   \alpha   -th ordinal which is either admissible or a limit of admissibles; an ordinal which is both is called recursively inaccessible . 5 There exists a theory of large ordinals in this manner that is highly parallel to that of (small) large cardinals (one can define recursively Mahlo cardinals , for example). 6 But all these ordinals are still countable. Therefore, admissible ordinals seem to be the recursive analogue of regular cardinal numbers .  Notice that α is an admissible ordinal if and only if α is a limit ordinal and there does not exist a γ<α for which there is a Σ 1 (L α ) mapping from γ onto α. If M is a standard model of KP, then the set of ordinals in M is an admissible ordinal.
