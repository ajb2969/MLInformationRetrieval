   Transgression map      Transgression map   In algebraic topology, a transgression map is a way to transfer cohomology classes. It occurs, for example in the inflation-restriction exact sequence in group cohomology , and in integration in fibers . It also naturally arises in many spectral sequences ; see spectral sequence#Edge maps and transgressions .  Inflation-restriction exact sequence  The trangression map appears in the inflation-restriction exact sequence , an exact sequence occurring in group cohomology . Let G be a group , N a normal subgroup , and A an abelian group which is equipped with an action of G , i.e., a homomorphism from G to the automorphism group of A . The quotient group G/N acts on ''A N = { a   ∈     \in   A : na = a '' for all '' n   ∈     \in   N}''. Then the inflation-restriction exact sequence is:    0 → H 1 ( G / N , A N ) → H 1 ( G , A ) → H 1 ( N , A ) G / N → H 2 ( G / N , A N ) → H 2 ( G , A )       The transgression map is the map H 1 ( N , A ) G / N → H 2 ( G / N , A N )  Transgression is defined for general n   H n ( N , A ) G / N → H n +1 ( G / N , A N )   only if H i ( N , A ) G / N = 0 for i ≤ n -1. 1  References          External links     "  Category:Homological algebra  Category:Algebraic topology     Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.67 ↩
