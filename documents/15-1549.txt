All-trans-decaprenyl-diphosphate synthase

All-trans-decaprenyl-diphosphate synthase (, decaprenyl-diphosphate synthase, decaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase, polyprenylpyrophosphate synthetase, terpenoidallyltransferase, terpenyl pyrophosphate synthetase, trans-prenyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate:isopentenyl-diphosphate farnesyltranstransferase (adding 7 isopentenyl units).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate + 7 isopentenyl diphosphate

 
  7 diphosphate + all-trans-decaprenyl diphosphate
 

This enzyme catalyses the condensation reactions resulting in the formation of all-trans-decaprenyl diphosphate.
