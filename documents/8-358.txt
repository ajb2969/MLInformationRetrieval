Duality (electrical circuits)

In electrical engineering, electrical terms are associated into pairs called duals. A dual of a relationship is formed by interchanging voltage and current in an expression. The dual expression thus produced is of the same form, and the reason that the dual is always a valid statement can be traced to the duality of electricity and magnetism.
Here is a partial list of electrical dualities:

voltage – current
parallel – serial (circuits)
resistance – conductance
impedance – admittance
capacitance – inductance
reactance – susceptance
short circuit – open circuit
Kirchhoff's current law – Kirchhoff's voltage law.
Thévenin's theorem – Norton's theorem

History
The use of duality in circuit theory is due to Alexander Russell who published his ideas in 1904.12
Examples
Constitutive relations

Resistor and conductor (Ohm's law)










Capacitor and inductor – differential form










Capacitor and inductor – integral form









Voltage division — current division
