   Duality (electrical circuits)      Duality (electrical circuits)   In electrical engineering , electrical terms are associated into pairs called duals . A dual of a relationship is formed by interchanging voltage and current in an expression. The dual expression thus produced is of the same form, and the reason that the dual is always a valid statement can be traced to the duality of electricity and magnetism .  Here is a partial list of electrical dualities:   voltage – current  parallel – serial (circuits)  resistance – conductance  impedance – admittance  capacitance – inductance  reactance – susceptance  short circuit – open circuit  Kirchhoff's current law – Kirchhoff's voltage law .  Thévenin's theorem – Norton's theorem   History  The use of duality in circuit theory is due to Alexander Russell who published his ideas in 1904. 1 2  Examples  Constitutive relations   Resistor and conductor (Ohm's law)          v  =   i  R    ⇔   i  =   v   G        iff    v    i  R      i    v  G      v=iR\iff i=vG\,         Capacitor and inductor – differential form           i  C   =   C   d   d  t     v  C     ⇔    v  L   =   L   d   d  t     i  L        iff     subscript  i  C     C    d    d  t     subscript  v  C        subscript  v  L     L    d    d  t     subscript  i  L       i_{C}=C\frac{d}{dt}v_{C}\iff v_{L}=L\frac{d}{dt}i_{L}         Capacitor and inductor – integral form            v  C    (  t  )    =    V  0   +    1  C     ∫  0  t     i  C    (  τ  )   d  τ       ⇔     i  L    (  t  )    =    I  0   +    1  L     ∫  0  t     v  L    (  τ  )   d  τ          iff       subscript  v  C   t      subscript  V  0       1  C     superscript   subscript   0   t      subscript  i  C   τ  d  τ            subscript  i  L   t      subscript  I  0       1  L     superscript   subscript   0   t      subscript  v  L   τ  d  τ         v_{C}(t)=V_{0}+{1\over C}\int_{0}^{t}i_{C}(\tau)\,d\tau\iff i_{L}(t)=I_{0}+{1%
