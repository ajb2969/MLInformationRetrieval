2,4-dichlorobenzoyl-CoA reductase

In enzymology, a 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl-CoA reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA + NADP+ + HCl 
 
 
 
  2,4-dichlorobenzoyl-CoA + NADPH + H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA, NADP+, and HCl, whereas its 3 products are 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl-CoA, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA:NADP+ oxidoreductase (halogenating). This enzyme participates in 2,4-dichlorobenzoate degradation.
