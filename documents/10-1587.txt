Cardinal function

In mathematics, a cardinal function (or cardinal invariant) is a function that returns cardinal numbers.
Cardinal functions in set theory

The most frequently used cardinal function is a function which assigns to a set "A" its cardinality, denoted by | A |.


Aleph numbers and beth numbers can both be seen as cardinal functions defined on ordinal numbers.


Cardinal arithmetic operations are examples of functions from cardinal numbers (or pairs of them) to cardinal numbers.


Cardinal characteristics of a (proper) ideal I of subsets of X are:



 
 .


The "additivity" of I is the smallest number of sets from I whose union is not in I any more. As any ideal is closed under finite unions, this number is always at least 
 
 
 
 ; if I is a σ-ideal, then add(I)≥
 
 
 
 .
 




 
 .
 
The "covering number" of I is the smallest number of sets from I whose union is all of X. As X itself is not in I, we must have add(I) ≤ cov(I).
 




 
 ,
 
The "uniformity number" of I (sometimes also written 
 
 
 
 ) is the size of the smallest set not in I. Assuming I contains all singletons, add(I) ≤ non(I).
 





The "cofinality" of I is the cofinality of the partial order (I, ⊆). It is easy to see that we must have non(I) ≤ cof(I) and cov(I) ≤ cof(I).
 




In the case that 
 
 
 
  is an ideal closely related to the structure of the reals, such as the ideal of Lebesgue null sets or the ideal of meagre sets, these cardinal invariants are referred to as cardinal characteristics of the continuum.
 


For a preordered set

 
  the bounding number

 
  and dominating number

 
  is defined as

In PCF theory the cardinal function 
 
 
 
  is used.1

Cardinal functions in topology
Cardinal functions are widely used in topology as a tool for describing various topological properties.23 Below are some examples. (Note: some authors, arguing that "there are no finite cardinal numbers in general topology",4 prefer to define the cardinal functions listed below so that they never taken on finite cardinal numbers as values; this requires modifying some of the definitions given below, e.g. by adding "
 
 
 
 " to the right-hand side of the definitions, etc.)

Perhaps the simplest cardinal invariants of a topological space X are its cardinality and the cardinality of its topology, denoted respectively by |X | and o(X).
The weight w(X ) of a topological space X is the cardinality of the smallest base for X. When w(X ) = 
 
 
 
  the space X is said to be second countable.
 
The 

 
 -weight of a space X is the cardinality of the smallest 
 
 
 
 -base for X.

The character of a topological space X at a point x is the cardinality of the smallest local base for x. The character of space X is
 




When 
 
 
 
  the space X is said to be first countable.
The density d(X ) of a space X is the cardinality of the smallest dense subset of X. When 
 
 
 
  the space X is said to be separable.
The Lindelöf number L(X ) of a space X is the smallest infinite cardinality such that every open cover has a subcover of cardinality no more than L(X ). When 
 
 
 
  the space X is said to be a Lindelöf space.
The cellularity or Suslin number of a space X is
 


 
  is a family of mutually disjoint non-empty open subsets of 
 
 
 
 .


The Hereditary cellularity (sometimes spread) is the least upper bound of cellularities of its subsets:
 




or

The tightness t(x, X) of a topological space X at a point

 
  is the smallest cardinal number 
 
 
 
  such that, whenever 
 
 
 
  for some subset Y of X, there exists a subset Z of Y, with |Z | ≤ 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
 . Symbolically,
 




The tightness of a space X is 
 
 
 
 . When ''t(X) = ''
 
 
 
  the space X is said to be countably generated or countably tight.

The augmented tightness of a space X, 
 
 
 
  is the smallest regular cardinal

 
  such that for any 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  there is a subset Z of Y with cardinality less than 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
 .


Basic inequalities

c(X) ≤ d(X) ≤ w(X) ≤ o(X) ≤ 2|X|



 
 (X) ≤ w(X)
 

Cardinal functions in Boolean algebras
Cardinal functions are often used in the study of Boolean algebras.56 We can mention, for example, the following functions:

Cellularity

 
  of a Boolean algebra 
 
 
 
  is the supremum of the cardinalities of antichains in 
 
 
 
 .
Length

 
  of a Boolean algebra 
 
 
 
  is



 
  is a chain



Depth

 
  of a Boolean algebra 
 
 
 
  is



 
  is a well-ordered subset 
 
 
 
 .

Incomparability

 
  of a Boolean algebra 
 
 
 
  is



 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .

Pseudo-weight

 
  of a Boolean algebra 
 
 
 
  is



 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
Cardinal functions in algebra
Examples of cardinal functions in algebra are:

Index of a subgroup H of G is the number of cosets.
Dimension of a vector space V over a field K is the cardinality of any Hamel basis of V.
More generally, for a free module M over a ring R we define rank 
 
 
 
  as the cardinality of any basis of this module.
For a linear subspace W of a vector space V we define codimension of W (with respect to V).
For any algebraic structure it is possible to consider the minimal cardinality of generators of the structure.
For algebraic extensions algebraic degree and separable degree are often employed (note that the algebraic degree equals the dimension of the extension as a vector space over the smaller field).
For non-algebraic field extensions transcendence degree is likewise used.
