   Heegner number      Heegner number   In number theory , a Heegner number is a square-free positive integer  d such that the imaginary quadratic field  Q (     −   d        normal-−   d    \sqrt{−}{d}   ) has class number 1. Equivalently, its ring of integers has unique factorization . 1  The determination of such numbers is a special case of the class number problem , and they underlie several striking results in number theory.  According to the Stark–Heegner theorem there are precisely nine Heegner numbers:    , , , , , , , , .    This result was conjectured by Gauss and proven by Kurt Heegner in 1952.  Euler's prime-generating polynomial  Euler's prime-generating polynomial         n  2   -  n   +  41   ,         superscript  n  2   n   41    n^{2}-n+41,\,     which gives (distinct) primes for n = 1, ..., 40, is related to the Heegner number 163 = 4 · 41 − 1.  Euler's formula, with   n   n   n   taking the values 1,... 40 is equivalent to        n  2   +  n  +  41   ,       superscript  n  2   n  41    n^{2}+n+41,\,     with   n   n   n   taking the values 0,... 39, and Rabinowitz 2 proved that       n  2   +  n  +   p        superscript  n  2   n  p    n^{2}+n+p\,   gives primes for    n  =   0  ,  …  ,   p  -  2        n   0  normal-…    p  2      n=0,\dots,p-2   if and only if its discriminant    1  -   4  p       1    4  p     1-4p   equals minus a Heegner number.  (Note that    p  -  1      p  1    p-1   yields    p  2     superscript  p  2    p^{2}   , so    p  -  2      p  2    p-2   is maximal.) 1, 2, and 3 are not of the required form, so the Heegner numbers that work are    7  ,  11  ,  19  ,  43  ,  67  ,  163     7  11  19  43  67  163    7,11,19,43,67,163   , yielding prime generating functions of Euler's form for    2  ,  3  ,  5  ,  11  ,  17  ,  41     2  3  5  11  17  41    2,3,5,11,17,41   ; these latter numbers are called lucky numbers of Euler by F. Le Lionnais . 3  Almost integers and Ramanujan's constant  Ramanujan's constant is the transcendental number 4     e   π   163       superscript  e    π    163      e^{\pi\sqrt{163}}   , which is an almost integer , in that it is very close to an integer :       e   π   163     =  262 537 412 640 768 743.999 999 999 999 25...       superscript  e    π    163     262 537 412 640 768 743.999 999 999 999 25...    e^{\pi\sqrt{163}}=262\,537\,412\,640\,768\,743.999\,999\,999\,999\,25...    5      ≈    640 320  3   +  744.       absent     superscript  640 320  3   744.     \approx 640\,320^{3}+744.     This number was discovered in 1859 by the mathematician Charles Hermite . 6 In a 1975 April Fool article in Scientific American magazine, 7 "Mathematical Games" columnist Martin Gardner made the (hoax) claim that the number was in fact an integer, and that the Indian mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan had predicted it—hence its name.  This coincidence is explained by complex multiplication and the q -expansion of the j-invariant .  Detail  Briefly,    j   (    (   1  +    -  d     )   /  2   )       j      1      d     2     j((1+\sqrt{-d})/2)   is an integer for d a Heegner number, and     e   π   d     ≈    -   j   (    (   1  +    -  d     )   /  2   )     +  744        superscript  e    π    d           j      1      d     2     744     e^{\pi\sqrt{d}}\approx-j((1+\sqrt{-d})/2)+744   via the q -expansion.  If   τ   τ   \tau   is a quadratic irrational, then the j -invariant is an algebraic integer of degree    |   Cl   (   𝐐   (  τ  )    )    |        Cl    𝐐  τ      |\mbox{Cl}(\mathbf{Q}(\tau))|   , the class number of    𝐐   (  τ  )       𝐐  τ    \mathbf{Q}(\tau)   and the minimal (monic integral) polynomial it satisfies is called the Hilbert class polynomial . Thus if the imaginary quadratic extension    𝐐   (  τ  )       𝐐  τ    \mathbf{Q}(\tau)   has class number 1 (so d is a Heegner number), the j -invariant is an integer.  The q -expansion of j , with its Fourier series expansion written as a Laurent series in terms of    q  =   exp   (   2  π  i  τ   )        q      2  π  i  τ      q=\exp(2\pi i\tau)   , begins as:        j   (  q  )    =    1  q   +  744  +   196 884  q   +  ⋯    .        j  q       1  q   744    196 884  q   normal-⋯     j(q)=\frac{1}{q}+744+196\,884q+\cdots.     The coefficients    c  n     subscript  c  n    c_{n}   asymptotically grow as     ln   (   c  n   )    ∼    4  π   n    +   O   (   ln   (  n  )    )        similar-to     subscript  c  n        4  π    n      O    n       \ln(c_{n})\sim 4\pi\sqrt{n}+O(\ln(n))   , and the low order coefficients grow more slowly than    200 000  n     superscript  200 000  n    200\,000^{n}   , so for    q  ≪   1  /  200 000      much-less-than  q    1  200 000     q\ll 1/200\,000   , j is very well approximated by its first two terms. Setting    τ  =    (   1  +    -  163     )   /  2       τ      1      163     2     \tau=(1+\sqrt{-163})/2   yields    q  =   -   exp   (   -   π   163     )         q          π    163         q=-\exp(-\pi\sqrt{163})   or equivalently,     1  q   =   -   exp   (   π   163    )           1  q         π    163        \frac{1}{q}=-\exp(\pi\sqrt{163})   . Now     j   (    (   1  +    -  163     )   /  2   )    =    (   -  640 320   )   3         j      1      163     2     superscript    640 320   3     j((1+\sqrt{-163})/2)=(-640\,320)^{3}   , so,         (   -  640 320   )   3   =    -   e   π   163      +  744  +   O   (   e   -   π   163      )      .       superscript    640 320   3        superscript  e    π    163      744    O   superscript  e      π    163          (-640\,320)^{3}=-e^{\pi\sqrt{163}}+744+O\left(e^{-\pi\sqrt{163}}\right).   Or,       e   π   163     =    640 320  3   +  744  +   O   (   e   -   π   163      )          superscript  e    π    163        superscript  640 320  3   744    O   superscript  e      π    163          e^{\pi\sqrt{163}}=640\,320^{3}+744+O\left(e^{-\pi\sqrt{163}}\right)   where the linear term of the error is,       -   196 884  /   e   π   163       ≈   196 884  /   (    640 320  3   +  744   )    ≈   -  0.000 000 000 000 75             196 884   superscript  e    π    163         196 884     superscript  640 320  3   744           0.000 000 000 000 75      -196\,884/e^{\pi\sqrt{163}}\approx 196\,884/(640\,320^{3}+744)\approx-0.000\,0%

For similar formulas, see the Ramanujan–Sato series .  Other Heegner numbers  For the four largest Heegner numbers, the approximations one obtains 8 are as follows.      e   π   19       superscript  e    π    19      \displaystyle e^{\pi\sqrt{19}}     Alternatively, 9      e   π   19       superscript  e    π    19      \displaystyle e^{\pi\sqrt{19}}   where the reason for the squares is due to certain Eisenstein series . For Heegner numbers    d  <  19      d  19    d<19   , one does not obtain an almost integer; even    d  =  19      d  19    d=19   is not noteworthy. 10 The integer j -invariants are highly factorisable, which follows from the      12  3     (    n  2   -  1   )   3    =    (    2  2   ⋅  3  ⋅   (   n  -  1   )   ⋅   (   n  +  1   )    )   3          superscript  12  3    superscript     superscript  n  2   1   3     superscript   normal-⋅   superscript  2  2   3    n  1     n  1    3     12^{3}(n^{2}-1)^{3}=(2^{2}\cdot 3\cdot(n-1)\cdot(n+1))^{3}   form, and factor as,      j   (    (   1  +    -  19     )   /  2   )       j      1      19     2     \displaystyle j((1+\sqrt{-19})/2)     These transcendental numbers , in addition to being closely approximated by integers, (which are simply algebraic numbers of degree 1), can also be closely approximated by algebraic numbers of degree 3, 11      e   π   19       superscript  e    π    19      \displaystyle e^{\pi\sqrt{19}}     The roots of the cubics can be exactly given by quotients of the Dedekind eta function  η ( τ ), a modular function involving a 24th root, and which explains the 24 in the approximation. In addition, they can also be closely approximated by algebraic numbers of degree 4, 12      e   π   19       superscript  e    π    19      \displaystyle e^{\pi\sqrt{19}}     Note the reappearance of the integers    n  =   3  ,  9  ,  21  ,  231       n   3  9  21  231     n=3,9,21,231   as well as the fact that,         2  6   ⋅  3    (    -   3  2    +   3  ⋅  19  ⋅   1  2     )    =   96  2          normal-⋅   superscript  2  6   3        superscript  3  2     normal-⋅  3  19   superscript  1  2       superscript  96  2     \displaystyle 2^{6}\cdot 3(-3^{2}+3\cdot 19\cdot 1^{2})=96^{2}     which, with the appropriate fractional power, are precisely the j-invariants. As well as for algebraic numbers of degree 6,      e   π   19       superscript  e    π    19      \displaystyle e^{\pi\sqrt{19}}     where the x s are given respectively by the appropriate root of the sextic equations ,         5   x  6    -   96   x  5    -   10   x  3     +  1   =  0            5   superscript  x  6      96   superscript  x  5      10   superscript  x  3     1   0    \displaystyle 5x^{6}-96x^{5}-10x^{3}+1=0     with the j-invariants appearing again. These sextics are not only algebraic, they are also solvable in radicals as they factor into two cubics over the extension    ℚ   5       ℚ    5     \mathbb{Q}\sqrt{5}   (with the first factoring further into two quadratics ). These algebraic approximations can be exactly expressed in terms of Dedekind eta quotients. As an example, let    τ  =    (   1  +    -  163     )   /  2       τ      1      163     2     \tau=(1+\sqrt{-163})/2   , then,      e   π   163       superscript  e    π    163      \displaystyle e^{\pi\sqrt{163}}     where the eta quotients are the algebraic numbers given above.  Consecutive primes  Given an odd prime p , if one computes     k  2      (   mod  p   )      annotated   superscript  k  2    pmod  p     k^{2}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)   for    k  =   0  ,  1  ,  …  ,    (   p  -  1   )   /  2        k   0  1  normal-…      p  1   2      k=0,1,\dots,(p-1)/2   (this is sufficient because      (   p  -  k   )   2   ≡    k  2      (   mod  p   )         superscript    p  k   2    annotated   superscript  k  2    pmod  p      (p-k)^{2}\equiv k^{2}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)   ), one gets consecutive composites, followed by consecutive primes, if and only if p is a Heegner number. 13  For details, see "Quadratic Polynomials Producing Consecutive Distinct Primes and Class Groups of Complex Quadratic Fields" by Richard Mollin.
