   Brodal queue      Brodal queue   In computer science , the Brodal queue is a heap / priority queue structure with very low worst case  time bounds     O   (  1  )       O  1    O(1)   for insertion, find-minimum, meld (merge two queues) and decrease-key and    O   (   log   (  n  )    )       O    log  n     O(\mathrm{log}(n))   for delete-minimum and general deletion; they are the first heap variant with these bounds. Brodal queues are named after their inventor Gerth Stølting Brodal . 1  While having better asymptotic bounds than other priority queue structures, they are, in the words of Brodal himself, "quite complicated" and "[not] applicable in practice." 2 Brodal and Okasaki describe a persistent ( functional ) version of Brodal queues. 3  References    "  Category:Heaps (data structures)     Gerth Stølting Brodal (1996).
