Q-gamma function

In q-analog theory, the q-gamma function, or basic gamma function, is a generalization of the ordinary Gamma function closely related to the double gamma function. It was introduced by . It is given by


 
  when |q| \Gamma_q(x)=\frac{(q^{-1};q^{-1})_\infty}{(q^{-x};q^{-1})_\infty}(q-1)^{1-x}q^{\binom{x}{2}}  if |q|>1. Here (·;·)∞ is the infinite q-Pochhammer symbol. It satisfies the functional equation



For non-negative integers n,



where [·]q! is the q-factorial function. Alternatively, this can be taken as an extension of the q-factorial function to the real number system.
The relation to the ordinary gamma function is made explicit in the limit



A q-analogue of Stirling's formula for |q| \Gamma_q(x) =[2]_{q^{\ }}^{\frac 12} \Gamma_{q^2}\left(\frac 12\right)(1-q)^{\frac 12-x}e^{\frac{\theta q^x}{1-q-q^x}}, \quad 0
A q-analogue of the multiplication formula for |q| \Gamma_{q^n}\left(\frac {x}n\right)\Gamma_{q^n}\left(\frac {x+1}n\right)\cdots\Gamma_{q^n}\left(\frac {x+n-1}n\right) =[n]_q^{\frac 12-x}\left([2]_q \Gamma^2_{q^2}\left(\frac12\right)\right)^{\frac{n-1}{2}}\Gamma_q(x).
Due to I. Mező, the q-analogue of the Raabe formula exists, at least if we use the q-gamma function when |q|>1. With this restriction
