   Transverse measure      Transverse measure   In mathematics , a measure on a real  vector space is said to be transverse to a given set if it assigns measure zero to every translate of that set, while assigning finite and positive (i.e. non-zero) measure to some compact set .  Definition  Let V be a real vector space together with a metric space structure with respect to which it is a complete space . A Borel measure  μ is said to be transverse to a Borel-measurable subset S of V if   there exists a compact subset K of V with 0 < μ ( K ) < +∞; and  μ ( v + S ) = 0 for all v ∈ V , where          v  +  S   =   {    v  +  s   ∈  V   |   s  ∈  S   }         v  S    conditional-set      v  s   V     s  S      v+S=\{v+s\in V|s\in S\}       is the translate of S by v .   The first requirement ensures that, for example, the trivial measure is not considered to be a transverse measure.  Example  As an example, take V to be the Euclidean plane  R 2 with its usual Euclidean norm/metric structure. Define a measure μ on R 2 by setting μ ( E ) to be the one-dimensional Lebesgue measure of the intersection of E with the first coordinate axis:        μ   (  E  )    =    λ  1    (   {   x  ∈  𝐑   |    (  x  ,  0  )   ∈  E  ⊆   𝐑  2    }   )     .        μ  E      superscript  λ  1    conditional-set    x  𝐑        x  0   E        superscript  𝐑  2         \mu(E)=\lambda^{1}\big(\{x\in\mathbf{R}|(x,0)\in E\subseteq\mathbf{R}^{2}\}%
 \big).     An example of a compact set K with positive and finite μ -measure is K = B 1 (0), the closed unit ball about the origin, which has μ ( K ) = 2. Now take the set S to be the second coordinate axis. Any translate ( v 1 , v 2 ) + S of S will meet the first coordinate axis in precisely one point, ( v 1 , 0). Since a single point has Lebesgue measure zero, μ (( v 1 , v 2 ) + S ) = 0, and so μ is transverse to S .  See also   Prevalent and shy sets   References     "  Category:Measures (measure theory)
