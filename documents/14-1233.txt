   Regularized canonical correlation analysis      Regularized canonical correlation analysis   Regularized canonical correlation analysis is a way of using ridge regression to solve the singularity problem in the cross-covariance matrices of canonical correlation analysis . By converting    cov   (  X  ,  X  )      cov  X  X    \operatorname{cov}(X,X)   and    cov   (  Y  ,  Y  )      cov  Y  Y    \operatorname{cov}(Y,Y)   into     cov   (  X  ,  X  )    +   λ   I  X         cov  X  X     λ   subscript  I  X      \operatorname{cov}(X,X)+\lambda I_{X}   and     cov   (  Y  ,  Y  )    +   λ   I  Y         cov  Y  Y     λ   subscript  I  Y      \operatorname{cov}(Y,Y)+\lambda I_{Y}   , it ensures that the above matrices will have reliable inverses .  The idea probably dates back to Hrishikesh D. Vinod 's publication in 1976 where he called it "Canonical ridge". 1 2 It has been suggested for use in the analysis of functional neuroimaging data as such data are often singular. 3 It is possible to compute the regularized canonical vectors in the lower-dimensional space. 4  References     "  Category:Mathematical analysis  Category:Calculus of variations     ↩  ↩  ↩  Section 3.18.5 ↩
