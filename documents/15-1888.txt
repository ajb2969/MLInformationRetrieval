Methylenediurea deaminase

Methylenediurea deaminase (, methylenediurease) is an enzyme with system name methylenediurea aminohydrolase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

methylenediurea + 2 H2O 
 
 
 
  N-(hydroxymethyl)urea + 2 NH3 + CO2 (overall reaction)
 
(1a) methylenediurea + H2O 
 
 
 
  N-(carboxyaminomethyl)urea + NH3

(1b) N-(carboxyaminomethyl)urea 
 
 
 
  N-(aminomethyl)urea + CO2 (spontaneous)
 
(1c) N-(aminomethyl)urea + H2O 
 
 
 
  N-(hydroxymethyl)urea + NH3 (spontaneous)
 

Methylenediurea is hydrolysed and decarboxylated to give an aminated methylurea.
