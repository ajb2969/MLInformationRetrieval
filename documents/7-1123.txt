Q-difference polynomial

In combinatorial mathematics, the q-difference polynomials or q-harmonic polynomials are a polynomial sequence defined in terms of the q-derivative. They are a generalized type of Brenke polynomial, and generalize the Appell polynomials. See also Sheffer sequence.
Definition
The q-difference polynomials satisfy the relation



where the derivative symbol on the left is the q-derivative. In the limit of 
 
 
 
 , this becomes the definition of the Appell polynomials:



Generating function
The generalized generating function for these polynomials is of the type of generating function for Brenke polynomials, namely



where 
 
 
 
  is the q-exponential:



Here, 
 
 
 
  is the q-factorial and



is the q-Pochhammer symbol. The function 
 
 
 
  is arbitrary but assumed to have an expansion



Any such 
 
 
 
  gives a sequence of q-difference polynomials.
