   Krylov–Bogolyubov theorem      Krylov–Bogolyubov theorem   In mathematics , the Krylov–Bogolyubov theorem (also known as the existence of invariant measures theorem ) may refer to either of the two related fundamental theorems within the theory of dynamical systems . The theorems guarantee the existence of invariant measures for certain "nice" maps defined on "nice" spaces and were named after Russian - Ukrainian  mathematicians and theoretical physicists  Nikolay Krylov and Nikolay Bogolyubov who proved the theorems. 1  Formulation of the theorems  Invariant measures for a single map  Theorem (Krylov–Bogolyubov) . Let ( X , T ) be a compact , metrizable  topological space and F : X → X a continuous map . Then F admits an invariant Borel  probability measure .  That is, if Borel( X ) denotes the Borel  σ-algebra generated by the collection T of open subsets of X , then there exists a probability measure μ : Borel( X ) → [0, 1] such that for any subset A ∈ Borel( X ),        μ   (    F   -  1     (  A  )    )    =   μ   (  A  )     .        μ     superscript  F    1    A      μ  A     \mu\left(F^{-1}(A)\right)=\mu(A).     In terms of the push forward , this states that         F  *    (  μ  )    =  μ   .         subscript  F    μ   μ    F_{*}(\mu)=\mu.     Invariant measures for a Markov process  Let X be a Polish space and let       P  t   ,  t   ≥  0   ,        subscript  P  t   t   0    P_{t},t\geq 0,   be the transition probabilities for a time-homogeneous Markov  semigroup on X , i.e.        Pr   [    X  t   ∈  A   |    X  0   =  x   ]    =    P  t    (  x  ,  A  )     .       Pr     subscript  X  t   A      subscript  X  0   x       subscript  P  t    x  A      \Pr[X_{t}\in A|X_{0}=x]=P_{t}(x,A).     Theorem (Krylov–Bogolyubov) . If there exists a point    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   for which the family of probability measures { P t ( x , ·) | t > 0 } is uniformly tight and the semigroup ( P t ) satisfies the Feller property , then there exists at least one invariant measure for ( P t ), i.e. a probability measure μ on X such that         (   P  t   )   ∗    (  μ  )    =   μ  for all  t   >  0.           subscript   subscript  P  t   normal-∗   μ     μ  for all  t        0.     (P_{t})_{\ast}(\mu)=\mu\mbox{ for all }t>0.     See also   For the 1st theorem: Ya. G. Sinai (Ed.) (1997): Dynamical Systems II.
