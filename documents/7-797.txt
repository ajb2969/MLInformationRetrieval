   Monetary policy reaction function      Monetary policy reaction function   The monetary policy reaction function (MPRF) is the upward-sloping relationship between the inflation rate and the unemployment rate . When the inflation rate rises, a central bank wishing to fight inflation will raise interest rates to reduce output and thus increase the unemployment rate .  The MPRF is explained by the Taylor rule , the LM curve , and Okun's law .  The MPRF has the equation:      u  =    u  0   +   Φ   (   π  -   π  t    )         u     subscript  u  0     normal-Φ    π   subscript  π  t        u=u_{0}+\Phi(\pi-\pi_{t})     Where   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is a parameter that tells us how much unemployment rises when the central bank raises the real interest rate    r   r   r   because it thinks that inflation is too high and needs to be reduced.  The Slope of the MPRF is    1  Φ      1  normal-Φ    \frac{1}{\Phi}     The MPRF is used hand in hand with the Phillips Curve to determine the effects of economic policy . This framework illustrates equilibrium levels of the unemployment rate and the inflation rate in a sticky-price model .  Alternative  Alternatively, in Ben Bernanke and Robert H. Frank 's Principles of Economics textbook, the MPRF is a model of the Fed's interest rate behavior. In its most simple form, the MPRF is an upward-sloping relationship between the real interest rate and the inflation rate. The following is an example of an MPRF from the third edition of the textbook:  r = r* + g(π - π*)  r = target real interest rate (or actual real interest rate) r* = long-run target for the real interest rate g = constant term (or the slope of the MPRF) π = actual inflation rate π* = long-run target for the inflation rate  Of course, the MPRF above is just one example, and there are other examples (such as the Taylor rule ) that are more complex.
