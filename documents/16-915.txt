   Andreotti–Norguet formula      Andreotti–Norguet formula  The Andreotti–Norguet formula , first introduced by , 1 is a higher–dimensional analogue of Cauchy integral formula for expressing the derivatives of a holomorphic function . Precisely, this formula express the value of the partial derivative of any multiindex  order of a holomorphic function of several variables , 2 in any interior point of a given bounded  domain , as a hypersurface integral of the values of the function on the boundary of the domain itself. In this respect, it is analogous and generalizes the Bochner–Martinelli formula , 3 reducing to it when the absolute value of the multiindex order of differentiation is   0   0    . 4 When considered for functions of complex variables, it reduces to the ordinary Cauchy formula for the derivative of a holomorphic function: 5 however, when    n  >    1       n    normal-  1     n> 1   , its integral kernel is not obtainable by simple differentiation of the Bochner–Martinelli kernel . 6  Historical note  The Andreotti–Norguet formula was first published in the research announcement : 7 however, its full proof was only published later in the paper . 8 Another, different proof of the formula was given by . 9 In 1977 and 1978, Lev Aizenberg gave still another proof and a generalization of the formula based on the Cauchy–Fantappiè–Leray kernel instead on the Bochner–Martinelli kernel . 10  The Andreotti–Norguet integral representation formula  The notation adopted in the following description of the integral representation formula is the one used by  and by : the notations used in the original works and in other references, though equivalent, are significantly different. 11 Precisely, it is assumed that       n  >    1       n    normal-  1     n> 1   is a fixed natural number ,      ζ  ,   z  ∈   ℂ      ζ    z  normal-∈  normal-  normal-ℂ     ζ,z∈ ℂ   are complex vectors ,  is a multiindex whose absolute value is ,      D  ⊂   ℂ      D  normal-⊂  normal-  normal-ℂ    D⊂ ℂ   is a bounded domain whose closure is    D  ¯     normal-¯  D    \overline{D}   ,      A   (  D  )       A  D    A(D)   is the function space of functions holomorphic on the interior of   D   D   D   and continuous on its boundary     ∂  D      normal-∂  D    ∂D   .  the iterated Wirtinger derivatives of order   α   α   α   of a given complex valued function    f  ∈  A   (  D  )       f  normal-∈  A  D    f∈A(D)   are expressed using the following simplified notation:          ∂  α   f   =     ∂   |  α  |    f     ∂    z  1   α  1    ⋯     ∂   z  n   α  n        .        superscript   α   f       superscript     α    f          superscript   subscript  z  1    subscript  α  1    normal-⋯       superscript   subscript  z  n    subscript  α  n         \partial^{\alpha}f=\frac{\partial^{|\alpha|}f}{\partial z_{1}^{\alpha_{1}}%
