Basic theorems in algebraic K-theory
Throughout, for simplicity, we assume when an exact category is a subcategory of another exact category, we mean it is strictly full subcategory (i.e., isomorphism-closed.)
Let 
 
 
 
  be exact categories. Then C is said to be cofinal in D if (i) it is closed under extension in D and if (ii) for each object M in D there is an N in D such that 
 
 
 
  is in C. The prototypical example is when C is the category of free modules and D is the category of projective modules.
