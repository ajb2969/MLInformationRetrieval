   NAD+ synthase      NAD+ synthase   In enzymology , a NAD + synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + deamido-NAD + + NH 3    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + NAD +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , deamido-NAD + , and NH 3 , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and NAD + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds as acid-D-ammonia (or amine) ligases (amide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is deamido-NAD + :ammonia ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include NAD + synthetase , NAD + synthase , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthetase , and diphosphopyridine nucleotide synthetase . This enzyme participates in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism and nitrogen metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 11 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , and .
