3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase (NADP+)

 3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase (NADP+) () is an enzyme with system name 3-hydroxypropionate:NADP+ oxidoreductase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

3-hydroxypropionate + NADP+

 
  malonate semialdehyde + NADPH + H+


This enzyme catalyses the reduction of malonate semialdehyde to 3-hydroxypropionate, which is a key step in the 3-hydroxypropionate and the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycles, autotrophic CO2 fixation pathways found in some green non-sulfur phototrophic bacteria and archaea, respectively. The enzyme from Chloroflexus aurantiacus is bifunctional, and also catalyses the upstream reaction in the pathway, EC 1.2.1.75. Different from EC 1.1.1.59, 3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase (NAD+), by cofactor preference.
