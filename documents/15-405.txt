The tessellation fills space by 6-simplex, truncated 6-simplex, bitruncated 6-simplex, and tritruncated 6-simplex facets. These facet types occur in proportions of 2:2:2:1 respectively in the whole honeycomb.
It can be constructed by seven sets of parallel hyperplanes that divide space. The hyperplane intersections generate cyclotruncated 5-simplex honeycomb divisions on each hyperplane.
