   Half-side formula      Half-side formula   In spherical trigonometry , the half side formula relates the angles and lengths of the sides of spherical triangles , which are triangles drawn on the surface of a sphere and so have curved sides and do not obey the formulas for plane triangles. 1  Formulas  The half-side formulas are 2      tan   (    a  2    )         a  2     \displaystyle\tan\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)     where   a , b , c are the lengths of the sides respectively opposite α , β , γ ,      S  =    1  2    (   α  +  β  +  γ   )        S      1  2     α  β  γ      S=\frac{1}{2}(\alpha+\beta+\gamma)   is half the sum of the angles, and       R  =     -   cos  S      cos   (   S  -  α   )     cos   (   S  -  β   )     cos   (   S  -  γ   )        .      R          S          S  α        S  β        S  γ         R=\sqrt{\frac{-\cos S}{\cos(S-\alpha)\cos(S-\beta)\cos(S-\gamma)}}.      The three formulas are really the same formula, with the names of the variables permuted.  See also   Spherical law of cosines   References  "  Category:Spherical trigonometry     . ↩  . ↩
