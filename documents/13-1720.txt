Half-side formula

 In spherical trigonometry, the half side formula relates the angles and lengths of the sides of spherical triangles, which are triangles drawn on the surface of a sphere and so have curved sides and do not obey the formulas for plane triangles.1
Formulas
The half-side formulas are2



where

a, b, c are the lengths of the sides respectively opposite α, β, γ,


 
  is half the sum of the angles, and




The three formulas are really the same formula, with the names of the variables permuted.
