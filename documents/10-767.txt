Deoxycytidylate C-methyltransferase




Deoxycytidylate C-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a deoxycytidylate C-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate + dCMP 
 
 
 
  dihydrofolate + deoxy-5-methylcytidylate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolic acid and dCMP, whereas its two products are dihydrofolic acid and deoxy-5-methylcytidylic acid.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:dCMP C-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include deoxycytidylate methyltransferase, and dCMP methyltransferase.
