   353 (number)      353 (number)   353 is the natural number between 352 and 354. It is a prime number .  In mathematics  In connection with Euler's sum of powers conjecture , 353 is the smallest number whose 4th power is equal to the sum of four other 4th powers, as discovered by R. Norrie in 1911: 1 2 3        353  4   =    30  4   +   120  4   +   272  4   +   315  4     .       superscript  353  4      superscript  30  4    superscript  120  4    superscript  272  4    superscript  315  4      353^{4}=30^{4}+120^{4}+272^{4}+315^{4}.   353 is a palindromic prime , 4 an irregular prime , 5 and a super-prime . 6 353 is one of the solutions to the stamp folding problem : there are exactly 353 ways to fold a strip of eight blank stamps into a single flat pile of stamps. 7 In a seven-team round robin tournament , there are 353 combinatorially distinct outcomes in which no subset of teams wins all its games against the teams outside the subset; mathematically, there are 353 strongly connected  tournaments on seven nodes. 8  Other uses  353 is also the country code for telephone numbers in the Republic of Ireland .
