   Chinese remainder theorem      Chinese remainder theorem   The Chinese remainder theorem is a result about congruences in number theory and its generalizations in abstract algebra . It was first published in the 3rd to 5th centuries by the Chinese mathematician Sun Tzu .  In its basic form, the Chinese remainder theorem will determine a number n that, when divided by some given divisors, leaves given remainders. For example, what is the lowest number n that when divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, when divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 3, and when divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 2?  Theorem statement  The original form of the theorem, which is contained in the 5th-century book Sunzi's Mathematical Classic () by the Chinese mathematician Sun Tzu and later generalized with a complete solution called Dayanshu () in Qin Jiushao 's 1247 Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections (, Shushu Jiuzhang ), is a statement about simultaneous congruences.  Suppose are positive integers that are pairwise coprime . Then, for any given sequence of integers , there exists an integer   x   x   x   solving the following system of simultaneous congruences.      {      x  ‚â°   a  1       (   mod   n  1    )        ‚ãØ         x  ‚â°   a  k       (   mod   n  k    )         cases    x   subscript  a  1     pmod   subscript  n  1    normal-‚ãØ  otherwise    x   subscript  a  k     pmod   subscript  n  k      \begin{cases}x\equiv a_{1}&\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}n_{1})\\
 \quad\cdots\\
 x\equiv a_{k}&\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}n_{k})\end{cases}     Furthermore, all solutions   x   x   x   of this system are congruent modulo the product,  n 1 ... n k }} . Hence         x  ‚â°   y     (   mod   n  i    )     ,   1  ‚â§  i  ‚â§  k      ‚ü∫  x   ‚â°   y     (   mod  N   )      .     formulae-sequence   formulae-sequence    x   annotated  y   pmod   subscript  n  i          1  i       k        normal-‚ü∫  x    annotated  y   pmod  N       x\equiv y\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}n_{i}),\quad 1\leq i\leq k\qquad%
 \Longleftrightarrow\qquad x\equiv y\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}N).     Sometimes, the simultaneous congruences can be solved even if the are not pairwise coprime. A solution   x   x   x   exists if and only if:       a  i   ‚â°     a  j      (   mod   gcd   (   n  i   ,   n  j   )     )     for all  i  and  j         subscript  a  i     annotated   subscript  a  j    pmod     subscript  n  i    subscript  n  j        for all  i  and  j      a_{i}\equiv a_{j}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}\gcd(n_{i},n_{j}))\qquad\text{for all %
 }i\text{ and }j     All solutions   x   x   x   are then congruent modulo the least common multiple of the .  Sun Tzu's work contains neither a proof nor a full algorithm. What amounts to an algorithm for solving this problem was described by Aryabhata (6th century; see ). Special cases of the Chinese remainder theorem were also known to Brahmagupta (7th century), and appear in Fibonacci 's Liber Abaci (1202).  A modern restatement of the theorem in algebraic language is that for a positive integer with prime factorization      n  =    p  1   r  1    ‚ãØ   p  k   r  k         n     superscript   subscript  p  1    subscript  r  1    normal-‚ãØ   superscript   subscript  p  k    subscript  r  k       n=p_{1}^{r_{1}}\cdots p_{k}^{r_{k}}     we have the isomorphism between a ring and the direct product of its prime power parts:        ùêô  /  n   ùêô   ‚âÖ       ùêô  /   p  1   r  1     ùêô   √ó  ‚ãØ  √ó  ùêô   /   p  k   r  k     ùêô           ùêô  n   ùêô             ùêô   superscript   subscript  p  1    subscript  r  1     ùêô   normal-‚ãØ  ùêô    superscript   subscript  p  k    subscript  r  k     ùêô     \mathbf{Z}/n\mathbf{Z}\cong\mathbf{Z}/p_{1}^{r_{1}}\mathbf{Z}\times\cdots%
 \times\mathbf{Z}/p_{k}^{r_{k}}\mathbf{Z}     The theorem can also be restated in the language of combinatorics as the fact that the infinite arithmetic progressions of integers form a Helly family .  Existence and uniqueness  The existence and uniqueness of the solution can easily be seen through a non-constructive argument:  There are  n 1 ¬∑‚Ä¶¬∑ n k }} different   k   k   k   - tuples of remainders. Let us call this set   R   R   R   . On the other hand  and each element of  corresponds to an element of   R   R   R   . Can two numbers  correspond to the same member of   R   R   R   ? That is, can they have the same set of remainders when divided by ? If they did then    a  ‚àí  b      a  normal-‚àí  b    a‚àíb   would be divisible by each . Since the are relatively prime,    a  ‚àí  b      a  normal-‚àí  b    a‚àíb   would be divisible by their product:   N   N   N   . But, as   x   x   x     Existence can be seen by an explicit construction of    a   (   m  o  d  b   )       a    m  o  d  b     a(modb)   . Let denote the multiplicative inverse of   a   a   a   given by the Extended Euclidean algorithm . It is defined exactly when   b   b   b   and    k  =  2      k  2    k=2   are coprime; the following construction explains why this condition is needed.  === Case of two equations (    {      x  ‚â°   a  1       (   mod   n  1    )        x  ‚â°   a  2       (   mod   n  2    )         cases    x   subscript  a  1     pmod   subscript  n  1      x   subscript  a  2     pmod   subscript  n  2      \begin{cases}x\equiv a_{1}&\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}n_{1})\\

Multiplying both sides by    x  =    x   n  2     [   n  2   -  1    ]    n  1     +   x   n  1     [   n  1   -  1    ]    n  2          x      x   subscript  n  2    subscript   delimited-[]   superscript   subscript  n  2     1      subscript  n  1       x   subscript  n  1    subscript   delimited-[]   superscript   subscript  n  1     1      subscript  n  2        x=xn_{2}\left[n_{2}^{-1}\right]_{n_{1}}+xn_{1}\left[n_{1}^{-1}\right]_{n_{2}}   , we get        x      n  2     [   n  2   -  1    ]    n  1     ‚èü   1    +   x     n  1   ‚èü   0     [   n  1   -  1    ]    n  2      ‚â°    x  √ó  1   +   x  √ó  0  √ó    [   n  1   -  1    ]    n  2      ‚â°   x     (   mod   n  1    )              x   subscript   normal-‚èü     subscript  n  2    subscript   delimited-[]   superscript   subscript  n  2     1      subscript  n  1      1      x   subscript   normal-‚èü   subscript  n  1    0    subscript   delimited-[]   superscript   subscript  n  1     1      subscript  n  2          x  1     x  0   subscript   delimited-[]   superscript   subscript  n  1     1      subscript  n  2            annotated  x   pmod   subscript  n  1        x\underbrace{n_{2}\left[n_{2}^{-1}\right]_{n_{1}}}_{1}+x\underbrace{n_{1}}_{0}%

 \right]_{n_{2}}     But we know that , thus this suggests that the coefficient of the first term on the right-hand-side expression can be replaced by . Similarly, we can show that the coefficient of the second term can be substituted by . We can now define the value         a  1    n  2     [   n  2   -  1    ]    n  1     +    a  2    n  1     [   n  1   -  1    ]    n  2      ‚â°     a  1   √ó  1   +    a  2   √ó  0  √ó    [   n  1   -  1    ]    n  2      ‚â°    a  1      (   mod   n  1    )               subscript  a  1    subscript  n  2    subscript   delimited-[]   superscript   subscript  n  2     1      subscript  n  1        subscript  a  2    subscript  n  1    subscript   delimited-[]   superscript   subscript  n  1     1      subscript  n  2           subscript  a  1   1      subscript  a  2   0   subscript   delimited-[]   superscript   subscript  n  1     1      subscript  n  2            annotated   subscript  a  1    pmod   subscript  n  1        a_{1}n_{2}\left[n_{2}^{-1}\right]_{n_{1}}+a_{2}n_{1}\left[n_{1}^{-1}\right]_{n%

Let  n 1 ... n k }} be the product of every modulus then define     x   x   x     and this is seen to satisfy the system of congruences by a similar calculation as before.  Finding the solution with basic algebra and modular arithmetic  For example, consider the problem of finding an integer    {      x  ‚â°   2     (   mod  3   )           x  ‚â°   3     (   mod  4   )           x  ‚â°   1     (   mod  5   )            cases    x   annotated  2   pmod  3     otherwise    x   annotated  3   pmod  4     otherwise    x   annotated  1   pmod  5     otherwise    \begin{cases}x\equiv 2\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}3)\\

We start by translating these congruences into equations for some   u   u   u   , and    {      x  =   2  +   3  t           x  =   3  +   4  s           x  =   1  +   5  u            cases    x    2    3  t     otherwise    x    3    4  s     otherwise    x    1    5  u     otherwise    \begin{cases}x=2+3t\\

Substitute    x  =   2  +   3  t    =   2  +   3   (   3  +   4  s    )     =   11  +   12  s          x    2    3  t           2    3    3    4  s             11    12  s       x=2+3t=2+3(3+4s)=11+12s   into the first equation:     x   x   x     Substitute this    11  +   12  s       11    12  s     \displaystyle 11+12s   into the third congruence:      s  =   0  +   5  u        s    0    5  u      s=0+5u     meaning that   u   u   u   for some integer    x  =   11  +   12  s    =   11  +   12   (   5  u   )     =   11  +   60  u          x    11    12  s           11    12    5  u            11    60  u       x=11+12s=11+12(5u)=11+60u   .

So, we have solutions  Notice that 60 = lcm(3,4,5). If the moduli are pairwise coprime (as they are in this example), the solutions will be congruent modulo their product.  A constructive algorithm to find the solution  The following algorithm only applies if the are pairwise coprime. (For simultaneous congruences when the moduli are not pairwise coprime, the method of successive substitution can often yield solutions.)  Suppose, as above, that a solution is required for the system of congruences:     i   i   i     Define:  n 1 ... n k }} . For each   1   1   1   , the integers and are coprime.

All other solutions are congruent to 191 modulo 60, [3 √ó 4 √ó 5], which means they are all congruent to 11 modulo 60.  Or in words:   Find a number that gives modulo 1 for a particular divisor, but is divisible by all other divisors (coprime, in this case).  Multiply the remainder (of the original number N to this particular divisor). Repeat with all the divisors.  Sum all these products together.  Divide the sum by the LCM of all the divisors. N shares the modulo with the final remainder.   Thus, we have values of 40 (divisible by 4 and 5; gives 1 for mod 3), 45 (for mod 4) and 36 (for mod 5). Multiplying by the given remainders 2, 3 and 1 yields 80, 135 and 36 respectively. The sum, 251, is then divided by 60, yielding remainder 11 .

These sets however will produce the same solution; i.e.,       (  70  )   2   +    (  21  )   3   +    (  15  )   2    =   233  ‚â°  23   (   m  o  d  105   )            70  2     21  3     15  2      233  normal-‚â°  23    m  o  d  105      (70)2+(21)3+(15)2=233‚â°23(mod105)   .

Chinese Remainder Theorem for Commutative Rings.

Applications  Sequence numbering  The Chinese remainder theorem can be used to construct an elegant G√∂del numbering for sequences , which is needed to prove G√∂del's incompleteness theorems .  Fast Fourier transform  The Good-Thomas fast Fourier transform algorithm exploits a re-indexing of the data based on the Chinese remainder theorem. The Prime-factor FFT algorithm contains an implementation.  Encryption  The Chinese remainder theorem can also be used in secret sharing , which consists of distributing a set of shares among a group of people who, all together (but no one alone), can recover a certain secret from the given set of shares. Each of the shares is represented in a congruence, and the solution of the system of congruences using the Chinese remainder theorem is the secret to be recovered. Secret Sharing using the Chinese Remainder Theorem uses, along with the Chinese remainder theorem, special sequences of integers that guarantee the impossibility of recovering the secret from a set of shares with less than a certain cardinality .

Dedekind's theorem  Dedekind's Theorem on the Linear Independence of Characters. Let   k   k   k   be a monoid and   k   k   k   an integral domain , viewed as a monoid by considering the multiplication on      ‚àë   i  ‚àà  I      Œ±  i    f  i     =  0        subscript     i  I       subscript  Œ±  i    subscript  f  i     0    \sum_{i\in I}\alpha_{i}f_{i}=0   . Then any finite family of distinct monoid homomorphisms is linearly independent. In other words every family of elements satisfying     k   k   k     must be equal to the family .  Proof. First assume that   k   k   k   is a field, otherwise, replace the integral domain   k   k   k   by its quotient field, and nothing will change. We can linearly extend the monoid homomorphisms to    k  M  M      k  M  M    kMM   -algebra homomorphisms , where   M   M   M   is the monoid ring of   k   k   k   over       ‚àë   i  ‚àà  I      Œ±  i    f  i     =  0   ,        subscript     i  I       subscript  Œ±  i    subscript  f  i     0    \sum_{i\in I}\alpha_{i}f_{i}=0,   . Then, by linearity, the condition        ‚àë   i  ‚àà  I      Œ±  i    F  i     =  0.        subscript     i  I       subscript  Œ±  i    subscript  F  i     0.    \sum_{i\in I}\alpha_{i}F_{i}=0.     yields      i  ,   j  ‚àà  I   ;   i  ‚â†  j      i    j  normal-‚àà  I     i  normal-‚â†  j     i,j‚ààI;i‚â†j     Next, for   k   k   k   the two    k  M  M      k  M  M    kMM   -linear maps and are not proportional to each other. Otherwise and would also be proportional, and thus equal since as monoid homomorphisms they satisfy: 1 {{=}} f j (1)}} , which contradicts the assumption that they are distinct.

QED.  Non-commutative case: a caveat  Sometimes in the commutative case, the conclusion of the Chinese Remainder Theorem is stated as . This version does not hold in the non-commutative case, since , as can be seen from the following case:   Proposition. Let   x   x   x   be the ring of non-commutative real polynomials in   y   y   y   and   I   I   I   . Let   x   x   x   be the principal two-sided ideal generated by   J   J   J   and     x  y   +  1        x  y   1    xy+1   the principal two-sided ideal generated by     I  +  J   =  R        I  J   R    I+J=R   . Then    I  ‚à©  J  ‚â†  I  J      I  normal-‚à©  J  normal-‚â†  I  J    I‚à©J‚â†IJ   but   I   I   I   .   Proof. Observe that   x   x   x   is formed by all polynomials with an   J   J   J   in every term and that every polynomial in    y  =   ‚àí   1  x        y    normal-‚àí    1  x      y=‚àí\frac{1}{x}   vanishes under the substitution    p  =    (    x  y   +  1   )   x  ‚àà  I  ‚à©  J       p        x  y   1   x  normal-‚àà  I  normal-‚à©  J     p=(xy+1)x‚ààI‚à©J   . Then clearly   R   R   R   . Define a "term in   R   R   R   ", as an element of the multiplicative monoid of   x   x   x   generated by   y   y   y   and    y  =  x      y  x    y=x   , and its degree as the usual degree of the term after the substitution    q  ‚àà  J      q  normal-‚àà  J    q‚ààJ   . On the other hand, suppose   q   q   q   . Observe that a term in   y   y   y   of maximum degree depends on   q   q   q   otherwise    y  =   ‚àí   1  x        y    normal-‚àí    1  x      y=‚àí\frac{1}{x}   under the substitution    q  ‚àà  I  J      q  normal-‚àà  I  J    q‚ààIJ   can not vanish. The same happens then for an element   y   y   y   . Note that the last    I  J      I  J    IJ   , from left to right, in a term of maximum degree in an element of   x   x   x   is preceded by more than one   x   x   x   . (We are counting here all the preceding   y   y   y   s. E.g., in the last   x   x   x   is preceded by three    p  =    (    x  y   +  1   )   x  ‚àâ  I  J       p        x  y   1   x  normal-‚àâ  I  J     p=(xy+1)x‚àâIJ   s.) This proves that   y   y   y   since the last   p   p   p   in the term of maximum degree in    x  y  x      x  y  x    xyx   (   x   x   x   ) is preceded by only one    I  ‚à©  J  ‚â†  I  J      I  normal-‚à©  J  normal-‚â†  I  J    I‚à©J‚â†IJ   . Hence     I  +  J   =  R        I  J   R    I+J=R   .  However, it is true in general that     I  ‚à©  J   =    I  J   +   J  I          I  normal-‚à©  J       I  J     J  I      I‚à©J=IJ+JI   implies     I  ‚à©  J   =     (   I  ‚à©  J   )    (   I  +  J   )   ‚äÇ  I  J   +   J  I          I  normal-‚à©  J         I  normal-‚à©  J     I  J   normal-‚äÇ  I  J     J  I      I‚à©J=(I‚à©J)(I+J)‚äÇIJ+JI   . To see this, note that   R   R   R   , while the opposite inclusion is obvious. Also, we have in general that, provided are pairwise coprime two-sided ideals in     R  /   (    I  1   ‚à©  ‚ãØ  ‚à©   I  m    )    ‚Üí    R  /   I  1    ‚äï  ‚ãØ  ‚äï   R  /   I  m        normal-‚Üí    R     subscript  I  1   normal-‚ãØ   subscript  I  m      direct-sum    R   subscript  I  1    normal-‚ãØ    R   subscript  I  m       R/(I_{1}\cap\cdots\cap I_{m})\to R/I_{1}\oplus\cdots\oplus R/I_{m}   , the natural map       I  ‚à©  J   =    I  J   +   J  I          I  normal-‚à©  J       I  J     J  I      I‚à©J=IJ+JI     is an isomorphism.
