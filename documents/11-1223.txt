   Cinnamate beta-D-glucosyltransferase      Cinnamate beta-D-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a cinnamate beta-D-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + trans-cinnamate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + trans-cinnamoyl beta-D-glucoside   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and trans-cinnamate , whereas its two products are UDP and trans-cinnamoyl beta-D-glucoside .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:trans-cinnamate beta-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-cinnamate glucosyltransferase , and UDPG:t-cinnamate glucosyltransferase .
