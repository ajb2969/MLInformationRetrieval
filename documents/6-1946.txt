   Large set (Ramsey theory)      Large set (Ramsey theory)   In Ramsey theory , a set  S of natural numbers is considered to be a large set if and only if Van der Waerden's theorem can be generalized to assert the existence of arithmetic progressions with common difference in S . That is, S is large if and only if every finite partition of the natural numbers has a cell containing arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions having common differences in S .  Examples   The natural numbers are large. This is precisely the assertion of Van der Waerden's theorem .  The even numbers are large.   Properties  Necessary conditions for largeness include:   If S is large, for any natural number n , S must contain infinitely many multiples of n .  If    S  =   {   s  1   ,   s  2   ,   s  3   ,  …  }       S    subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2    subscript  s  3   normal-…     S=\{s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},\dots\}   is large, it is not the case that s k ≥3 s k-1 for k ≥ 2.   Two sufficient conditions are:   If S contains n-cubes for arbitrarily large n, then S is large.  If    S  =    p   (  ℕ  )    ∩  ℕ       S      p  ℕ   ℕ     S=p(\mathbb{N})\cap\mathbb{N}   where   p   p   p   is a polynomial with     p   (  0  )    =  0        p  0   0    p(0)=0   and positive leading coefficient, then   S   S   S   is large.   The first sufficient condition implies that if S is a thick set , then S is large.  Other facts about large sets include:   If S is large and F is finite, then S – F is large.       k  ⋅  ℕ   =   {  k  ,   2  k   ,   3  k   ,  …  }        normal-⋅  k  ℕ    k    2  k     3  k   normal-…     k\cdot\mathbb{N}=\{k,2k,3k,\dots\}   is large. Similarly, if S is large,    k  ⋅  S     normal-⋅  k  S    k\cdot S   is also large.   If   S   S   S   is large, then for any   m   m   m   ,    S  ∩   {  x  :   x  ≡   0     (   mod  m   )     }       S   conditional-set  x    x   annotated  0   pmod  m        S\cap\{x:x\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}m)\}   is large.  2-large and k-large sets  A set is k -large , for a natural number k > 0, when it meets the conditions for largeness when the restatement of van der Waerden's theorem is concerned only with k -colorings. Every set is either large or k -large for some maximal k . This follows from two important, albeit trivially true, facts:   k -largeness implies ( k -1)-largeness for k>1  k -largeness for all k implies largeness.   It is unknown whether there are 2-large sets that are not also large sets. Brown, Graham, and Landman (1999) conjecture that no such sets exists.
