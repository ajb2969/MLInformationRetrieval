Valine dehydrogenase (NADP+)

  In enzymology, a valine dehydrogenase (NADP+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-valine + H2O + NADP+

 
  3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate + NH3 + NADPH + H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-valine, H2O, and NADP+, whereas its 4 products are 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate, NH3, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-valine:NADP+ oxidoreductase (deaminating). Other names in common use include valine dehydrogenase (nicotinanide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), and valine dehydrogenase (NADP+).
