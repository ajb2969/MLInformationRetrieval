   Valine dehydrogenase (NADP+)      Valine dehydrogenase (NADP+)   In enzymology , a valine dehydrogenase (NADP + ) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-valine + H 2 O + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate + NH 3 + NADPH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L- valine , H 2 O , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate , NH 3 , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH 2 group of donors with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-valine:NADP + oxidoreductase (deaminating) . Other names in common use include valine dehydrogenase (nicotinanide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) , and valine dehydrogenase (NADP + ) .
