Summary
Space time plot of a breathing dissipative soliton in a two-component reaction diffusion system, generated by Dr. Hendrik U. Boedeker(June 2007).
The system reads



with λ = 4.67, τ = 5.0, du2 = 0.000467, dv2 = 0.01, κ1 = -1.126, κ3 = -3.33, no-flux boundary conditions have been used.
A finite-element algorithm was used in the calculation.
