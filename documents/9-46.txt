Two-center bipolar coordinates.

In mathematics, two-center bipolar coordinates is a coordinate system, based on two coordinates which give distances from two fixed centers, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .1 This system is very useful in some scientific applications (e.g. calculating the electric field of a dipole on a plane).23
Transformation to Cartesian coordinates
 The transformation to Cartesian coordinates

 
  from two-center bipolar coordinates 
 
 
 
  is





 
  where the centers of this coordinate system are at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .4
Transformation to polar coordinates
When x>0 the transformation to polar coordinates from two-center bipolar coordinates is





 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the distance between the poles (coordinate system centers).
