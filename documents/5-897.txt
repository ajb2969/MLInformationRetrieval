   Barnett effect      Barnett effect   The Barnett effect is the magnetization of an uncharged body when spun on its axis. 1 It was discovered by American physicist Samuel Barnett in 1915. 2  An uncharged object rotating with angular velocity ω tends to spontaneously magnetize, with a magnetization given by:       M  =    χ  ω   /   γ     ,      M      χ  ω   γ     M=\chi\omega/\gamma\ ,     with γ = gyromagnetic ratio for the material, χ = magnetic susceptibility .  The magnetization occurs parallel to the axis of spin. Barnett was motivated by a prediction by Owen Richardson in 1908, later named the Einstein–de Haas effect , that magnetizing a ferromagnet can induce a mechanical rotation. He instead looked for the opposite effect, that is, that spinning a ferromagnet could change its magnetization. He established the effect with a long series of experiments between 1908 and 1915.
