   Citramalate lyase      Citramalate lyase   In enzymology , a citramalate lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (2S)-2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanedioate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetate + pyruvate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (2S)-2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanedioate , and two products , acetate and pyruvate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the oxo-acid-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (2S)-2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanedioate pyruvate-lyase (acetate-forming) . Other names in common use include citramalate pyruvate-lyase , citramalate synthase , citramalic-condensing enzyme , citramalate synthetase , citramalic synthase , (S)-citramalate lyase , (+)-citramalate pyruvate-lyase , citramalate pyruvate lyase , (3S)-citramalate pyruvate-lyase , and (2S)-2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanedioate pyruvate-lyase . This enzyme participates in c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 4.1.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
