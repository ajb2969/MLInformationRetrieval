   Hyoscyamine (6S)-dioxygenase      Hyoscyamine (6S)-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a hyoscyamine (6S)-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-hyoscyamine + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (6S)-hydroxyhyoscyamine + succinate + CO 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-hyoscyamine , 2-oxoglutarate , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are (6S)-hydroxyhyoscyamine , succinate , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-hyoscyamine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase ((6S)-hydroxylating) . Other names in common use include hyoscyamine 6beta-hydroxylase , hyoscyamine 6beta-dioxygenase , and hyoscyamine 6-hydroxylase . This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis ii . It has 2 cofactors : iron , and Ascorbate .  References     "  Category:EC 1.14.11  Category:Iron enzymes  Category:Ascorbate enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
