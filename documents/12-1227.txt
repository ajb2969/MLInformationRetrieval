   Strominger's equations      Strominger's equations   In heterotic string theory , the Strominger 's equations are the set of equations that are necessary and sufficient conditions for spacetime supersymmetry . It is derived by requiring the 4-dimensional spacetime to be maximally symmetric, and adding a warp factor on the internal 6-dimensional manifold. 1  Consider a metric   ω   ω   \omega   on the real 6-dimensional internal manifold Y and a Hermitian metric h on a vector bundle V . The equations are:   The 4-dimensional spacetime is Minkowski , i.e.,    g  =  η      g  η    g=\eta   .  The internal manifold Y must be complex, i.e., the Nijenhuis tensor must vanish    N  =  0      N  0    N=0   .  The Hermitian form    ω   ω   \omega   on the complex threefold Y , and the Hermitian metric h on a vector bundle V must satisfy,        ∂    ∂  ¯   ω    =      i  Tr  F   (  h  )    ∧   F   (  h  )     -   i  Tr   R  -    (  ω  )     ∧    R  -    (  ω  )      ,           normal-¯    ω            i  Tr  F  h     F  h      i  Tr   superscript  R    ω       superscript  R    ω      \partial\bar{\partial}\omega=i\text{Tr}F(h)\wedge F(h)-i\text{Tr}R^{-}(\omega)%
 \wedge R^{-}(\omega),            d  †   ω   =   i   (   ∂  -   ∂  ¯    )   ln   ||  Ω  ||     ,         superscript  d  normal-†   ω     i      normal-¯     ln   norm  normal-Ω      d^{\dagger}\omega=i(\partial-\bar{\partial})\text{ln}||\Omega||,    where    R  -     superscript  R     R^{-}   is the Hull-curvature two-form of   ω   ω   \omega   , F is the curvature of h , and   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is the holomorphic n -form; F is also known in the physics literature as the Yang-Mills field strength. Li and Yau showed that the second condition is equivalent to   ω   ω   \omega   being conformally balanced, i.e.,     d   (     ||  Ω  ||   ω    ω  2    )    =  0        d     subscript   norm  normal-Ω   ω    superscript  ω  2     0    d(||\Omega||_{\omega}\omega^{2})=0   . 2   The Yang-Mills field strength must satisfy,         ω   a   b  ¯      F   a   b  ¯      =  0   ,         superscript  ω    a   normal-¯  b      subscript  F    a   normal-¯  b      0    \omega^{a\bar{b}}F_{a\bar{b}}=0,          F   a  b    =   F    a  ¯    b  ¯     =  0.         subscript  F    a  b     subscript  F     normal-¯  a    normal-¯  b          0.     F_{ab}=F_{\bar{a}\bar{b}}=0.       These equations imply the usual field equations, and thus are the only equations to be solved.  However, there are topological obstructions in obtaining the solutions to the equations;   The second Chern class of the manifold, and the second Chern class of the gauge field must be equal, i.e.,      c  2    (  M  )    =    c  2    (  F  )           subscript  c  2   M      subscript  c  2   F     c_{2}(M)=c_{2}(F)     A holomorphic  n -form   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   must exists, i.e.,     h   n  ,  0    =  1       superscript  h   n  0    1    h^{n,0}=1   and     c  1   =  0       subscript  c  1   0    c_{1}=0   .   In case V is the tangent bundle    T  Y     subscript  T  Y    T_{Y}   and   ω   ω   \omega   is Kähler, we can obtain a solution of these equations by taking the Calabi-Yau metric on   Y   Y   Y   and    T  Y     subscript  T  Y    T_{Y}   .  Once the solutions for the Strominger's equations are obtained, the warp factor   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   , dilaton   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   and the background flux H , are determined by        Δ   (  y  )    =    ϕ   (  y  )    +  constant         normal-Δ  y       ϕ  y   constant     \Delta(y)=\phi(y)+\text{constant}   ,       ϕ   (  y  )    =     1  8   ln   ||  Ω  ||    +  constant         ϕ  y         1  8   ln   norm  normal-Ω    constant     \phi(y)=\frac{1}{8}\text{ln}||\Omega||+\text{constant}   ,       H  =    i  2    (    ∂  ¯   -  ∂   )   ω    .      H      i  2      normal-¯      ω     H=\frac{i}{2}(\bar{\partial}-\partial)\omega.
