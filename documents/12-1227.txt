Strominger's equations

In heterotic string theory, the Strominger's equations are the set of equations that are necessary and sufficient conditions for spacetime supersymmetry. It is derived by requiring the 4-dimensional spacetime to be maximally symmetric, and adding a warp factor on the internal 6-dimensional manifold.1
Consider a metric 
 
 
 
  on the real 6-dimensional internal manifold Y and a Hermitian metric h on a vector bundle V. The equations are:

The 4-dimensional spacetime is Minkowski, i.e., 
 
 
 
 .
The internal manifold Y must be complex, i.e., the Nijenhuis tensor must vanish 
 
 
 
 .
The Hermitian form

 
  on the complex threefold Y, and the Hermitian metric h on a vector bundle V must satisfy,
 






  where 
 
 
 
  is the Hull-curvature two-form of 
 
 
 
 , F is the curvature of h, and 
 
 
 
  is the holomorphic n-form; F is also known in the physics literature as the Yang-Mills field strength. Li and Yau showed that the second condition is equivalent to 
 
 
 
 
  being conformally balanced, i.e., 
 
 
 
 .2

The Yang-Mills field strength must satisfy,
 








These equations imply the usual field equations, and thus are the only equations to be solved.
However, there are topological obstructions in obtaining the solutions to the equations;

The second Chern class of the manifold, and the second Chern class of the gauge field must be equal, i.e., 
 
 

A holomorphic n-form 
 
 
 
 
  must exists, i.e., 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .

In case V is the tangent bundle 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is Kähler, we can obtain a solution of these equations by taking the Calabi-Yau metric on 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Once the solutions for the Strominger's equations are obtained, the warp factor 
 
 
 
 , dilaton 
 
 
 
  and the background flux H, are determined by
