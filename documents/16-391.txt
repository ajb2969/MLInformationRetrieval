   Descartes number      Descartes number   In number theory, a Descartes number is an odd number which would have been an odd perfect number , if one of its composite factors were prime. They are named after René Descartes who observed that the number 3 2 ⋅7 2 ⋅11 2 ⋅13 2 ⋅22021 {{=}} (3⋅1001) 2 ⋅(22⋅1001 − 1) {{=}} 198585576189 }} would be an odd perfect number if only   22021   22021   22021   were a prime number , since the sum-of-divisors function for   D   D   D   would satisfy, if 22021 were prime,      σ   (  D  )       σ  D    \displaystyle\sigma(D)     where we turn a blind eye to the fact that 22021 }} reveals that 22021 is composite !  A Descartes number is defined as an odd number    n  =   m  ⋅  p       n    m  normal-⋅  p     n=m⋅p   where   m   m   m   and   p   p   p   are coprime and     2  n   =   σ   (  m  )   ⋅   (   p  +  1   )          2  n     σ  m  normal-⋅    p  1      2n=σ(m)⋅(p+1)   , whence   p   p   p   is taken as a 'spoof' prime. The example given is the only one currently known.  If   m   m   m   is an odd almost perfect number , 1 that is,     σ   (  m  )    =   2  m  −  1         σ  m     2  m  normal-−  1     σ(m)=2m−1   and    2  m  −  1      2  m  normal-−  1    2m−1   is taken as a 'spoof' prime, then    n  =   m  ⋅   (   2  m  −  1   )        n    m  normal-⋅    2  m  normal-−  1      n=m⋅(2m−1)   is a Descartes number, since     σ   (  n  )    =   σ   (   m  ⋅   (   2  m  −  1   )    )    =   σ   (  m  )   ⋅  2  m   =    (   2  m  −  1   )   ⋅  2  m   =   2  n           σ  n     σ    m  normal-⋅    2  m  normal-−  1            σ  m  normal-⋅  2  m            2  m  normal-−  1   normal-⋅  2  m          2  n      σ(n)=σ(m⋅(2m−1))=σ(m)⋅2m=(2m−1)⋅2m=2n   . If    2  m  −  1      2  m  normal-−  1    2m−1   were prime,   n   n   n   would be an odd perfect number!
