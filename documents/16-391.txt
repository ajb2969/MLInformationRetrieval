Descartes number

In number theory, a Descartes number is an odd number which would have been an odd perfect number, if one of its composite factors were prime. They are named after René Descartes who observed that the number  32⋅72⋅112⋅132⋅22021 {{=}} (3⋅1001)2⋅(22⋅1001 − 1) {{=}} 198585576189 }} would be an odd perfect number if only 
 
 
 
  were a prime number, since the sum-of-divisors function for 
 
 
 
  would satisfy, if 22021 were prime,



where we turn a blind eye to the fact that  22021 }} reveals that 22021 is composite!
A Descartes number is defined as an odd number 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are coprime and 
 
 
 
 , whence 
 
 
 
  is taken as a 'spoof' prime. The example given is the only one currently known.
If 
 
 
 
  is an odd almost perfect number,1 that is, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is taken as a 'spoof' prime, then 
 
 
 
  is a Descartes number, since 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  were prime, 
 
 
 
  would be an odd perfect number!

Currently, the only known almost perfect numbers are the nonnegative powers of 2, whence the only known odd almost perfect number is  1. }}
