Papyrus 13

Papyrus 13, designated by siglum

13 or P13 in the Gregory-Aland numbering, is a fragmented manuscript of the New Testament in Greek. It was copied on papyrus in the 3rd century at approximately 225-250 CE.1
Description
Papyrus 13 was discovered by Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt in Oxyrhynchus, Egypt. It is currently housed at the British Library, Inv. Nr. 1532, and Egyptian Museum, SR 3796 25/1/55/2 (11), or PSI 1292.234
The surviving text is twelve columns, of 23 to 27 lines each, from a scroll. This is all from the Epistle to the Hebrews, namely 2:14-5:5; 10:8-22; 10:29-11:13; 11:28-12:17. Its presence of pagination 47-50 means that Hebrews was preceded by only one book in the original scroll, likely the Epistle to the Romans as in Papyrus 46.5 It is the largest papyrus manuscript of the New Testament outside the Chester Beatty Papyri.
It was written on the back of a papyrus containing the Epitome of Livy and some scholars think the manuscript was possibly brought to Egypt by a Roman official and left behind when he left his post.6
It has errors of itacism (ι and ει, ε and αι, υ and οι).7
Text
Papyrus 13 is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type. Aland placed it in Category I.8
It bears strong textual affinity with Codex Vaticanus, and also has an 80% agreement with Papyrus 46. It has numerous distinctive readings.9
Papyrus 13 is written recto-verso, with the verso (back) containing Hebrews and the recto (front) containing part of Livy's History of Rome, dated to around 200 AD.10
