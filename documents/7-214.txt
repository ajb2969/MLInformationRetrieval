   Positive and negative parts      Positive and negative parts   In mathematics , the positive part of a real or extended real -valued function is defined by the formula        f  +    (  x  )    =   max   (   f   (  x  )    ,  0  )    =   {      f   (  x  )        if  f   (  x  )    >  0       0    otherwise.               superscript  f    x       f  x   0         cases    f  x       if  f  x   0   0  otherwise.      f^{+}(x)=\max(f(x),0)=\begin{cases}f(x)&\mbox{ if }f(x)>0\\
 0&\mbox{ otherwise.}\end{cases}     Intuitively, the graph of    f  +     superscript  f     f^{+}   is obtained by taking the graph of   f   f   f   , chopping off the part under the x -axis, and letting    f  +     superscript  f     f^{+}   take the value zero there.  Similarly, the negative part of f is defined as        f  -    (  x  )    =   -   min   (   f   (  x  )    ,  0  )     =   {      -   f   (  x  )         if  f   (  x  )    <  0       0    otherwise.               superscript  f    x         f  x   0          cases      f  x        if  f  x   0   0  otherwise.      f^{-}(x)=-\min(f(x),0)=\begin{cases}-f(x)&\mbox{ if }f(x)<0\\
 0&\mbox{ otherwise.}\end{cases}     Note that both f + and f − are non-negative functions. A peculiarity of terminology is that the 'negative part' is neither negative nor a part (like the imaginary part of a complex number is neither imaginary nor a part).  The function f can be expressed in terms of f + and f − as       f  =    f  +   -   f  -     .      f     superscript  f     superscript  f       f=f^{+}-f^{-}.\,     Also note that       |  f  |   =    f  +   +    f  -           f      superscript  f     superscript  f       |f|=f^{+}+f^{-}\,   .  Using these two equations one may express the positive and negative parts as       f  +   =      |  f  |   +  f   2         superscript  f          f   f   2     f^{+}=\frac{|f|+f}{2}\,           f  -   =     |  f  |   -  f   2    .       superscript  f          f   f   2     f^{-}=\frac{|f|-f}{2}.\,     Another representation, using the Iverson bracket is       f  +   =   [  f  >  0  ]    f      fragments   superscript  f      fragments  normal-[  f   0  normal-]   f    f^{+}=[f>0]f\,          f  -   =  -   [  f  <  0  ]   f  .     fragments   superscript  f       fragments  normal-[  f   0  normal-]   f  normal-.    f^{-}=-[f<0]f.\,     One may define the positive and negative part of any function with values in a linearly ordered group .  Measure-theoretic properties  Given a measurable space ( X ,Σ), an extended real-valued function f is measurable  if and only if its positive and negative parts are. Therefore, if such a function f is measurable, so is its absolute value | f |, being the sum of two measurable functions. The converse, though, does not necessarily hold: for example, taking f as       f  =    1  V   -   1  2     ,      f     subscript  1  V     1  2      f=1_{V}-{1\over 2},   where V is a Vitali set , it is clear that f is not measurable, but its absolute value is, being a constant function.  The positive part and negative part of a function are used to define the Lebesgue integral for a real-valued function. Analogously to this decomposition of a function, one may decompose a signed measure into positive and negative parts — see the Hahn decomposition theorem .
