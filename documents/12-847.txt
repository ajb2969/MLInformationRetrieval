Concurrent estimation

In discrete event simulation concurrent estimation is a technique used to estimate the effect of alternate parameter settings on a discrete event system. For example from observation of a (computer simulated) telecommunications system with a specified buffer size 
 
 
 
 , one estimates what the performance would be if the buffer size had been set to the alternate values 
 
 
 
 . Effectively the technique generates (during a single simulation run) 
 
 
 
  alternative histories for the system state variables, which have the same probability of occurring as the main simulated state path; this results in a computational saving as compared to running 
 
 
 
  additional simulations, one for each alternative parameter value.
The technique was developed by Cassandras,1 Strickland and Panayiotou.2
