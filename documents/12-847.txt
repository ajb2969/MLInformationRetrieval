   Concurrent estimation      Concurrent estimation   In discrete event simulation  concurrent estimation is a technique used to estimate the effect of alternate parameter settings on a discrete event system. For example from observation of a (computer simulated) telecommunications system with a specified buffer size    B  0     subscript  B  0    B_{0}   , one estimates what the performance would be if the buffer size had been set to the alternate values     B  1   ,  …  ,   B  n       subscript  B  1   normal-…   subscript  B  n     B_{1},\ldots,B_{n}   . Effectively the technique generates (during a single simulation run)   n   n   n   alternative histories for the system state variables, which have the same probability of occurring as the main simulated state path; this results in a computational saving as compared to running   n   n   n   additional simulations, one for each alternative parameter value.  The technique was developed by Cassandras, 1 Strickland and Panayiotou. 2  References     "  Category:Control theory  Category:Events (computing)     vita.bu.edu ↩  vita.bu.edu ↩
