Elongated pentagonal gyrocupolarotunda

In geometry, the elongated pentagonal gyrocupolarotunda is one of the Johnson solids (J41). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a pentagonal gyrocupolarotunda (J33) by inserting a decagonal prism between its halves. Rotating either the pentagonal cupola (J5) or the pentagonal rotunda (J6) through 36Â degrees before inserting the prism yields an elongated pentagonal orthocupolarotunda (J40).
Formulae
The following formulae for volume and surface area can be used if all faces are regular, with edge length a:1
