Allene-oxide cyclase

In enzymology, an allene-oxide cyclase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(9Z)-(13S)-12,13-epoxyoctadeca-9,11,15-trienoate 
 
 
 
  (15Z)-12-oxophyto-10,15-dienoate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (9Z)-(13S)-12,13-epoxyoctadeca-9,11,15-trienoate, and one product, (15Z)-12-oxophyto-10,15-dienoate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically a class of other intramolecular oxidoreductases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (9Z)-(13S)-12,13-epoxyoctadeca-9,11,15-trienoate isomerase (cyclizing).
