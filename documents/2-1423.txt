   Restricted product      Restricted product   In mathematics, the restricted product is a construction in the theory of topological groups .  Let   I   I   I   be an indexing set;   S   S   S   a finite subset of   I   I   I   . If for each    i  ∈  I      i  I    i\in I   ,    G  i     subscript  G  i    G_{i}   is a locally compact group, and for each    i  ∈   I  \  S       i   normal-\  I  S     i\in I\backslash S   ,     K  i   ⊂   G  i        subscript  K  i    subscript  G  i     K_{i}\subset G_{i}   is an open compact subgroup, then the restricted product       ∏  i     G  i        superscript   subscript  product  i   normal-′    subscript  G  i     {\prod_{i}}^{\prime}G_{i}\,   is the subset of the product of the    G  i     subscript  G  i    G_{i}   's consisting of all elements     (   g  i   )    i  ∈  I      subscript   subscript  g  i     i  I     (g_{i})_{i\in I}   such that     g  i   ∈   K  i        subscript  g  i    subscript  K  i     g_{i}\in K_{i}   for all but finitely many    i  ∈   I  \  S       i   normal-\  I  S     i\in I\backslash S   .  This group is given the topology whose basis of open sets are those of the form        ∏  i     A  i     ,      subscript  product  i    subscript  A  i     \prod_{i}A_{i}\,,   where    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   is open in    G  i     subscript  G  i    G_{i}   and     A  i   =   K  i        subscript  A  i    subscript  K  i     A_{i}=K_{i}   for all but finitely many   i   i   i   .  One can easily prove that the restricted product is itself a locally compact group. The best known example of this construction is that of the adele ring and idele group of a global field .
