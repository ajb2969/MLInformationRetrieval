Restricted product

In mathematics, the restricted product is a construction in the theory of topological groups.
Let 
 
 
 
  be an indexing set; 
 
 
 
  a finite subset of 
 
 
 
 . If for each 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a locally compact group, and for each 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is an open compact subgroup, then the restricted product


 
  is the subset of the product of the 
 
 
 
 's consisting of all elements 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for all but finitely many 
 
 
 
 .
This group is given the topology whose basis of open sets are those of the form


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is open in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for all but finitely many 
 
 
 
 .
One can easily prove that the restricted product is itself a locally compact group. The best known example of this construction is that of the adele ring and idele group of a global field.
