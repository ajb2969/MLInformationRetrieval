   Quasi-isometry      Quasi-isometry   In mathematics , quasi-isometry is an equivalence relation on metric spaces that ignores their small-scale details in favor of their coarse structure . The concept is especially important in Gromov 's geometric group theory . 1  (Figure)  This lattice is quasi-isometric to the plane.   Definition  Suppose that   f   f   f   is a (not necessarily continuous) function from one metric space    (   M  1   ,   d  1   )      subscript  M  1    subscript  d  1     (M_{1},d_{1})   to a second metric space    (   M  2   ,   d  2   )      subscript  M  2    subscript  d  2     (M_{2},d_{2})   . Then   f   f   f   is called a quasi-isometry from    (   M  1   ,   d  1   )      subscript  M  1    subscript  d  1     (M_{1},d_{1})   to    (   M  2   ,   d  2   )      subscript  M  2    subscript  d  2     (M_{2},d_{2})   if there exist constants    A  ≥  1      A  1    A\geq 1   ,    B  ≥  0      B  0    B\geq 0   , and    C  ≥  0      C  0    C\geq 0   such that the following two properties both hold: 2   For every two points   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   in    M  1     subscript  M  1    M_{1}   , the distance between their images is (up to the additive constant   B   B   B   ) within a factor of   A   A   A   of their original distance. More formally:         ∀  x   ,  y   ∈   M  1    :       1  A     d  1    (  x  ,  y  )    -  B   ≤    d  2    (   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  y  )    )    ≤     A    d  1    (  x  ,  y  )    +  B     .     normal-:      for-all  x   y    subscript  M  1              1  A    subscript  d  1    x  y    B      subscript  d  2      f  x     f  y              A   subscript  d  1    x  y    B       \forall x,y\in M_{1}:\frac{1}{A}\;d_{1}(x,y)-B\leq d_{2}(f(x),f(y))\leq A\;d_{%
 1}(x,y)+B.     Every point of    M  2     subscript  M  2    M_{2}   is within the constant distance   C   C   C   of an image point. More formally:        ∀  z   ∈   M  2    :    ∃  x   ∈   M  1    :     d  2    (  z  ,   f   (  x  )    )    ≤  C    .       normal-:     for-all  z    subscript  M  2        x    subscript  M  1      normal-:         subscript  d  2    z    f  x     C      \forall z\in M_{2}:\exists x\in M_{1}:d_{2}(z,f(x))\leq C.      The two metric spaces    (   M  1   ,   d  1   )      subscript  M  1    subscript  d  1     (M_{1},d_{1})   and    (   M  2   ,   d  2   )      subscript  M  2    subscript  d  2     (M_{2},d_{2})   are called quasi-isometric if there exists a quasi-isometry   f   f   f   from    (   M  1   ,   d  1   )      subscript  M  1    subscript  d  1     (M_{1},d_{1})   to    (   M  2   ,   d  2   )      subscript  M  2    subscript  d  2     (M_{2},d_{2})   .  Examples  The map between the Euclidean plane and the plane with the Manhattan distance that sends every point to itself is a quasi-isometry: in it, distances are multiplied by a factor of at most    2      2    \sqrt{2}   .  The map    f  :    ℤ  n   ↦   ℝ  n       normal-:  f   maps-to   superscript  ℤ  n    superscript  ℝ  n      f:\mathbb{Z}^{n}\mapsto\mathbb{R}^{n}   (both with the Euclidean metric ) that sends every   n   n   n   -tuple of integers to itself is a quasi-isometry: distances are preserved exactly, and every real tuple is within distance     n  /  4         n  4     \sqrt{n/4}   of an integer tuple. In the other direction, the discontinuous function that rounds every tuple of real numbers to the nearest integer tuple is also a quasi-isometry: each point is taken by this map to a point within distance     n  /  4         n  4     \sqrt{n/4}   of it, so rounding changes the distance between pairs of points by adding or subtracting at most    2    n  /  4        2      n  4      2\sqrt{n/4}   .  Every pair of finite or bounded metric spaces is quasi-isometric. In this case, every function from one space to the other is a quasi-isometry.  Equivalence relation  If    f  :    M  1   ↦   M  2       normal-:  f   maps-to   subscript  M  1    subscript  M  2      f:M_{1}\mapsto M_{2}   is a quasi-isometry, then there exists a quasi-isometry    g  :    M  2   ↦   M  1       normal-:  g   maps-to   subscript  M  2    subscript  M  1      g:M_{2}\mapsto M_{1}   . Indeed,    g   (  x  )       g  x    g(x)   may be defined by letting   y   y   y   be any point in the image of   f   f   f   that is within distance   C   C   C   of   x   x   x   , and letting    g   (  x  )       g  x    g(x)   be any point in     f   -  1     (  y  )        superscript  f    1    y    f^{-1}(y)   .  Since the identity map is a quasi-isometry, and the composition of two quasi-isometries is a quasi-isometry, it follows that the relation of being quasi-isometric is an equivalence relation on the class of metric spaces.  Use in geometric group theory  Given a finite generating set  S of a finitely generated group  G , we can form the corresponding Cayley graph of S and G . This graph becomes a metric space if we declare the length of each edge to be 1. Taking a different finite generating set T results in a different graph and a different metric space, however the two spaces are quasi-isometric. 3 This quasi-isometry class is thus an invariant of the group G . Any property of metric spaces that only depends on a space's quasi-isometry class immediately yields another invariant of groups, opening the field of group theory to geometric methods.  Examples of quasi-isometry invariants of groups  The following are some examples of properties of group Cayley graphs that are invariant under quasi-isometry: 4  Hyperbolicity  A group is called hyperbolic if one of its Cayley graphs is a δ-hyperbolic space for some δ. When translating between different definitions of hyperbolicity, the particular value of δ may change, but the resulting notions of a hyperbolic group turn out to be equivalent.  Hyperbolic groups have a solvable word problem . They are biautomatic and automatic .: 5 indeed, they are strongly geodesically automatic , that is, there is an automatic structure on the group, where the language accepted by the word acceptor is the set of all geodesic words.  Growth  The growth rate of a group with respect to a symmetric generating set describes the size of balls in the group. Every element in the group can be written as a product of generators, and the growth rate counts the number of elements that can be written as a product of length n .  According to Gromov's theorem , a group of polynomial growth is virtually nilpotent , i.e. it has a nilpotent  subgroup of finite index . In particular, the order of polynomial growth    k  0     subscript  k  0    k_{0}   has to be a natural number and in fact     #   (  n  )    ∼   n   k  0       similar-to    normal-#  n    superscript  n   subscript  k  0      \#(n)\sim n^{k_{0}}   .  If    #   (  n  )       normal-#  n    \#(n)   grows more slowly than any exponential function, G has a subexponential growth rate . Any such group is amenable .  Ends  The ends of a topological space are, roughly speaking, the connected components of the “ideal boundary” of the space. That is, each end represents a topologically distinct way to move to infinity within the space. Adding a point at each end yields a compactification of the original space, known as the end compactification .  The ends of a finitely generated group are defined to be the ends of the corresponding Cayley graph ; this definition is insensitive to the choice of generating set. Every finitely-generated infinite group has either 1, 2, or infinitely many ends, and Stallings theorem about ends of groups provides a decomposition for groups with more than one end.  Amenability  An amenable group is a locally compact  topological group  G carrying a kind of averaging operation on bounded functions that is invariant under translation by group elements. The original definition, in terms of a finitely additive invariant measure (or mean) on subsets of G , was introduced by John von Neumann in 1929 under the German name "messbar" ("measurable" in English) in response to the Banach–Tarski paradox . In 1949 Mahlon M. Day introduced the English translation "amenable", apparently as a pun. 6  In discrete group theory , where G has the discrete topology , a simpler definition is used. In this setting, a group is amenable if one can say what proportion of G any given subset takes up.  If a group has a Følner sequence then it is automatically amenable.  Asymptotic cone  An ultralimit is a geometric construction that assigns to a sequence of metric spaces  X n a limiting metric space. An important class of ultralimits are the so-called asymptotic cones of metric spaces. Let ( X , d ) be a metric space, let ω be a non-principal ultrafilter on   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   and let p n ∈ X be a sequence of base-points. Then the ω –ultralimit of the sequence    (  X  ,   d  n   ,   p  n   )     X    d  n    subscript  p  n     (X,\frac{d}{n},p_{n})   is called the asymptotic cone of X with respect to ω and      (   p  n   )   n      subscript   subscript  p  n   n    (p_{n})_{n}\,   and is denoted    C  o  n   e  ω    (  X  ,  d  ,    (   p  n   )   n   )       C  o  n   subscript  e  ω    X  d   subscript   subscript  p  n   n      Cone_{\omega}(X,d,(p_{n})_{n})\,   . One often takes the base-point sequence to be constant, p n = p for some p ∈ X ; in this case the asymptotic cone does not depend on the choice of p ∈ X and is denoted by    C  o  n   e  ω    (  X  ,  d  )       C  o  n   subscript  e  ω    X  d     Cone_{\omega}(X,d)\,   or just    C  o  n   e  ω    (  X  )       C  o  n   subscript  e  ω   X    Cone_{\omega}(X)\,   .  The notion of an asymptotic cone plays an important role in geometric group theory since asymptotic cones (or, more precisely, their topological types and bi-Lipschitz types ) provide quasi-isometry invariants of metric spaces in general and of finitely generated groups in particular. 7 Asymptotic cones also turn out to be a useful tool in the study of relatively hyperbolic groups and their generalizations. 8  See also   Isometry   References  "  Category:Geometric group theory  Category:Metric geometry     ↩  P. de la Harpe, Topics in geometric group theory .
