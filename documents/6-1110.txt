   Magnetic complex impedance      Magnetic complex impedance   Magnetic complex impedance is equal to the relationship of the complex effective or amplitude value of a sinusoidal magnetic tension on the passive magnetic circuit or its element, and accordingly the complex effective or amplitude value of a sinusoidal magnetic current in this circuit or in this element.  Magnetic complex impedance [1, 2] is measured in units – [    1  Ω      1  normal-Ω    \frac{1}{\Omega}   ] and determined by the formula:       Z  M   =    N  ˙     I  ˙   M    =     N  ˙   m      I  ˙   M   m    =    z  M    e   j  ϕ            subscript  Z  M      normal-˙  N    subscript   normal-˙  I   M            subscript   normal-˙  N   m      subscript   normal-˙  I   M   m            subscript  z  M    superscript  e    j  ϕ        Z_{M}=\frac{\dot{N}}{\dot{I}_{M}}=\frac{\dot{N}_{m}}{\dot{I}_{M}m}=z_{M}e^{j\phi}     where     z  M   =   N   I  M    =    N  m    I   M  m            subscript  z  M     N   subscript  I  M            subscript  N  m    subscript  I    M  m        z_{M}=\frac{N}{I_{M}}=\frac{N_{m}}{I_{Mm}}   is the relationship of the effective or amplitude value of a magnetic tension and accordingly of the effective or amplitude magnetic current is called full magnetic resistance ( magnetic impedance ). The full magnetic resistance ( magnetic impedance ) is equal to the modulus of the complex magnetic impedance . The argument of a complex magnetic impedance is equal to the difference of the phases of the magnetic tension and magnetic current     ϕ  =   β  -  α       ϕ    β  α     \phi=\beta-\alpha   . Complex magnetic impedance can be presented in following form:       Z  M   =    z  M    e   j  ϕ     =     z  M    cos  ϕ    +   j   z  M    sin  ϕ     =    r  M   +   j   x  M            subscript  Z  M      subscript  z  M    superscript  e    j  ϕ               subscript  z  M     ϕ      j   subscript  z  M     ϕ             subscript  r  M     j   subscript  x  M        Z_{M}=z_{M}e^{j\phi}=z_{M}\cos\phi+jz_{M}\sin\phi=r_{M}+jx_{M}     where     r  M   =    z  M    cos  ϕ         subscript  r  M      subscript  z  M     ϕ      r_{M}=z_{M}\cos\phi   is the real part of the complex magnetic impedance , called the effective magnetic resistance ;     x  M   =    z  M    sin  ϕ         subscript  x  M      subscript  z  M     ϕ      x_{M}=z_{M}\sin\phi   is the imaginary part of the complex magnetic impedance , called the reactive magnetic resistance . The full magnetic resistance ( magnetic impedance ) is equal       z  M   =     r  M  2   +   x  M  2          subscript  z  M        superscript   subscript  r  M   2    superscript   subscript  x  M   2       z_{M}=\sqrt{r_{M}^{2}+x_{M}^{2}}   ,    ϕ  =   arctan    x  M    r  M         ϕ       subscript  x  M    subscript  r  M       \phi=\arctan{\frac{x_{M}}{r_{M}}}     References   Popov V.
