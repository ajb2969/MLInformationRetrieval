Necklace polynomial

In combinatorial mathematics, the necklace polynomials, or (Moreau's) necklace-counting function are the polynomials 
 
 
 
  in α such that



By Möbius inversion they are given by



where 
 
 
 
  is the classic Möbius function.
The necklace polynomials are closely related to the functions studied by , though they are not quite the same: Moreau counted the number of necklaces, while necklace polynomials count the number of aperiodic necklaces.
The necklace polynomials appear as:

the number of aperiodic necklaces (also called Lyndon words) that can be made by arranging 
 
 
 
  beads the color of each of which is chosen from a list of 
 
 
 
  colors (One respect in which the word "necklace" may be misleading is that if one picks such a necklace up off the table and turns it over, thus reversing the roles of clockwise and counterclockwise, one gets a different necklace, counted separately, unless the necklace is symmetric under such reflections.);
the dimension of the degree 
 
 
 
  piece of the free Lie algebra on 
 
 
 
  generators ("Witt's formula"1);
the number of monic irreducible polynomials of degree 
 
 
 
  over a finite field with 
 
 
 
  elements (when 
 
 
 
  is a prime power);
the exponent in the cyclotomic identity;
The number of Lyndon words of length n in an alphabet of size α.2
