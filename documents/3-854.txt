   Necklace polynomial      Necklace polynomial   In combinatorial mathematics, the necklace polynomials , or (Moreau's) necklace-counting function are the polynomials    M   (  α  ,  n  )       M   α  n     M(α,n)   in α such that        α  n   =    ∑    d   |  n      d   M   (  α  ,  d  )      .       superscript  α  n     subscript    fragments  d  normal-|  n      d  M   α  d       \alpha^{n}=\sum_{d\,|\,n}d\,M(\alpha,d).     By Möbius inversion they are given by       M   (  α  ,  n  )    =    1  n     ∑    d   |  n     μ   (   n  d   )    α  d            M   α  n        1  n     subscript    fragments  d  normal-|  n      μ    n  d    superscript  α  d        M(\alpha,n)={1\over n}\sum_{d\,|\,n}\mu\left({n\over d}\right)\alpha^{d}     where   μ   μ   μ   is the classic Möbius function .  The necklace polynomials are closely related to the functions studied by , though they are not quite the same: Moreau counted the number of necklaces, while necklace polynomials count the number of aperiodic necklaces.  The necklace polynomials appear as:   the number of aperiodic necklaces (also called Lyndon words ) that can be made by arranging   n   n   n   beads the color of each of which is chosen from a list of   α   α   α   colors (One respect in which the word "necklace" may be misleading is that if one picks such a necklace up off the table and turns it over, thus reversing the roles of clockwise and counterclockwise , one gets a different necklace, counted separately, unless the necklace is symmetric under such reflections.);  the dimension of the degree   n   n   n   piece of the free Lie algebra on   α   α   α   generators ("Witt's formula" 1 );  the number of monic irreducible polynomials of degree   n   n   n   over a finite field with   α   α   α   elements (when   α   α   α   is a prime power);  the exponent in the cyclotomic identity ;  The number of Lyndon words of length n in an alphabet of size α. 2   Values      M   (  1  ,  n  )       M   1  n     \displaystyle M(1,n)       where "gcd" is greatest common divisor and "lcm" is least common multiple .
