Śleszyński–Pringsheim theorem
In mathematics, the '''Śleszyński–Pringsheim theorem''' is a statement about
 convergence of certain continued fractions. It was discovered by Ivan Śleszyński1 and Alfred Pringsheim2 in the late 19th century.3
It states that if an, bn, for n = 1, 2, 3, ... are real numbers and |bn| ≥ |an| + 1 for all n, then



converges absolutely to a number ƒ satisfying 0  meaning that the series



where An / Bn are the convergents of the continued fraction, converges absolutely.
