   Śleszyński–Pringsheim theorem      Śleszyński–Pringsheim theorem  In mathematics, the '''Śleszyński–Pringsheim theorem''' is a statement about convergence of certain continued  fractions . It was discovered by Ivan  Śleszyński 1 and Alfred  Pringsheim 2 in the late 19th century. 3  It states that if a n , b n , for n = 1, 2, 3, ... are real numbers and | b n | ≥ | a n | + 1 for all n , then       a  1     b  1   +     a  2     b  2   +     a  3     b  3   +  ⋱            continued-fraction   subscript  a  1      subscript  b  1    continued-fraction   subscript  a  2      subscript  b  2    continued-fraction   subscript  a  3      subscript  b  3   normal-⋱         \cfrac{a_{1}}{b_{1}+\cfrac{a_{2}}{b_{2}+\cfrac{a_{3}}{b_{3}+\ddots}}}     converges absolutely to a number ƒ satisfying 0  meaning that the series       f  =    ∑  n    {     A  n    B  n    -    A   n  -  1     B   n  -  1      }     ,      f    subscript   n         subscript  A  n    subscript  B  n       subscript  A    n  1     subscript  B    n  1          f=\sum_{n}\left\{\frac{A_{n}}{B_{n}}-\frac{A_{n-1}}{B_{n-1}}\right\},     where A n / B n are the convergents of the continued fraction, converges absolutely.
