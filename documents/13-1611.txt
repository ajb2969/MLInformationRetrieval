   Ernst angle      Ernst angle   In magnetic resonance imaging , the Ernst angle is the flip angle (a.k.a. "tip" or "nutation" angle) for a particular spin that gives the maximal signal in the least amount of time, when signal averaging over many transients. This relationship was developed by Richard R. Ernst , winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. 1  2  The following equation relates the Ernst angle,    θ  E     subscript  θ  E    \theta_{E}   , to the experimental interpulse delay, d 1 ; the duration of the Free induction decay , aka "acquisition time", or "a t "; and the longitudinal relaxation time of the spin in question, T 1 :       cos   (   θ  E   )    =   e   -    (    d  1   +   a  t    )   /   T  1             subscript  θ  E     superscript  e         subscript  d  1    subscript  a  t     subscript  T  1        \cos(\theta_{E})=e^{-(d_{1}+a_{t})/T_{1}}     For example, if one wishes to get the best signal from a resonance with T 1 =3 sec, and one wishes to use d 1 = 1sec and a t =2 sec, the optimal tip angle is 68 degrees.  This relationship is especially important in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), where interscan delays (d 1 ) and acquisition times (a t ) are often short relative to the signal's T 1 value. In MRI, there is typically just the resonance of hydrogen being observed and the T 1 of hydrogen depends on its local environment. Note that d 1 and a t together may be referred to collectively as T R in the MRI community.       cos   (   θ  E   )    =   e   -    T  R   /   T  1             subscript  θ  E     superscript  e       subscript  T  R    subscript  T  1        \cos(\theta_{E})=e^{-T_{R}/T_{1}}     From which it is trivial to see that the Ernst angle is        θ  E   =   arccos   (   e   -    T  R    T  1      )     .       subscript  θ  E      superscript  e       subscript  T  R    subscript  T  1         \theta_{E}=\arccos\left(e^{-\frac{T_{R}}{T_{1}}}\right).
