   Blackman's theorem      Blackman's theorem   Blackman's theorem is a general procedure for calculating the change in an impedance due to feedback in a circuit. It was published by R.B. Blackman in 1943, 1 was connected to signal-flow analysis by John Choma , and was made popular in the extra element theorem by R. D. Middlebrook and the asymptotic gain model of Solomon Rosenstark . 2 3 4 5 Blackman's approach leads to the formula for the impedance Z between two selected terminals of a negative feedback amplifier as Blackman's formula :       Z  =    Z  D      1  +   |   T   S  C    |     1  +   |   T   O  C    |        ,      Z     subscript  Z  D       1     subscript  T    S  C        1     subscript  T    O  C          Z=Z_{D}\frac{1+|T_{SC}|}{1+|T_{OC}|}\ ,   where Z D = impedance with the feedback disabled, T SC = loop transmission with a small-signal short across the selected terminal pair, and T OC = loop transmission with an open circuit across the terminal pair. 6 The loop transmission also is referred to as the return ratio . 7 8 Blackman's formula can be compared with Middlebrook's result for the input impedance Z in of a circuit based upon the extra-element theorem: 9 10 11       Z   i  n    =    Z   i  n   ∞    [    1  +    Z  e  0   /  Z     1  +    Z  e  ∞   /  Z     ]         subscript  Z    i  n       subscript   superscript  Z      i  n     delimited-[]      1     subscript   superscript  Z  0   e   Z      1     subscript   superscript  Z    e   Z         Z_{in}=Z^{\infty}_{in}\left[\frac{1+Z^{0}_{e}/Z}{1+Z^{\infty}_{e}/Z}\right]     where:     Z   Z   Z   is the impedance of the extra element;    Z   i  n   ∞     subscript   superscript  Z      i  n     Z^{\infty}_{in}   is the input impedance with   Z   Z   Z   removed (or made infinite);    Z  e  0     subscript   superscript  Z  0   e    Z^{0}_{e}   is the impedance seen by the extra element   Z   Z   Z   with the input shorted (or made zero);    Z  e  ∞     subscript   superscript  Z    e    Z^{\infty}_{e}   is the impedance seen by the extra element   Z   Z   Z   with the input open (or made infinite).  Blackman's formula also can be compared with Choma's signal-flow result: 12        Z   S  S    =    Z   S  0     [    1  +   T  I     1  +   T  Z     ]     ,       subscript  Z    S  S       subscript  Z    S  0     delimited-[]      1   subscript  T  I      1   subscript  T  Z         Z_{SS}=Z_{S0}\left[\frac{1+T_{I}}{1+T_{Z}}\right]\ ,     where    Z   S  0      subscript  Z    S  0     Z_{S0}   is the value of    Z   S  S      subscript  Z    S  S     Z_{SS}   under the condition that a selected parameter P is set to zero, return ratio    T  Z     subscript  T  Z    T_{Z}   is evaluated with zero excitation and    T  I     subscript  T  I    T_{I}   is    T  Z     subscript  T  Z    T_{Z}   for the case of short-circuited source resistance. As with the extra-element result, differences are in the perspective leading to the formula. 13  See also   Mason's gain formula   Further reading       References  "  Category:Electronic feedback  Category:Signal processing  Category:Electronic amplifiers  Category:Control engineering
