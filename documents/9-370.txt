   Machmeter      Machmeter   (Figure)  Illustration showing the face of a Machmeter reading a Mach number of 0.83   A Machmeter is an aircraft  pitot-static system  flight instrument that shows the ratio of the true airspeed to the speed of sound , a dimensionless quantity called Mach number . This is shown on a Machmeter as a decimal fraction . An aircraft flying at the speed of sound is flying at a Mach number of one, expressed as Mach 1 .  Use  As an aircraft in transonic flight approaches the speed of sound, it first reaches its critical mach number, where air flowing over low-pressure areas of its surface locally reaches the speed of sound, forming shock waves . The indicated airspeed for this condition changes with ambient temperature, which in turn changes with altitude . Therefore, indicated airspeed is not entirely adequate to warn the pilot of the impending problems. Mach number is more useful, and most high-speed aircraft are limited to a maximum operating Mach number, also known as M MO .  For example, if the M MO is Mach 0.83, then at  where the speed of sound under standard conditions is , the true airspeed at M MO is . The speed of sound increases with air temperature, so at Mach 0.83 at  where the air is much warmer than at , the true airspeed at M MO would be .  Operation  Some older mechanical Machmeters use an altitude aneroid and an airspeed capsule which together convert pitot-static pressure into Mach number. Modern electronic Machmeters use information from an air data computer system.  Calibration  In subsonic flow the Mach meter can be calibrated according to:      M  =     5   [     (    p  t   p   )    2  7    -  1   ]          M      5   delimited-[]     superscript     subscript  p  t   p     2  7    1        {M}=\sqrt{5\left[\left(\frac{p_{t}}{p}\right)^{\frac{2}{7}}-1\right]}\,     where:      M    M   \ M\,   is Mach number        p   t      subscript  p  t    \ p_{t}\,   is total pressure and      p    p   \ p   is static pressure   and assuming the ratio of specific heats is 1.4   When a shock wave forms across the pitot tube the required formula is derived from the Rayleigh Supersonic Pitot equation, and is solved iteratively:      M  =   0.88128485    [    (     p  t   p   +  1   )     (   1  -   1   [   7   M  2    ]     )    5  2     ]         M    0.88128485     delimited-[]         subscript  p  t   p   1    superscript    1    1   delimited-[]    7   superscript  M  2         5  2          {M}=0.88128485\sqrt{\left[\left(\frac{p_{t}}{p}+1\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{[7M^{%
 2}]}\right)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right]}   where:       p   t     subscript  p  t    \ p_{t}   is now impact pressure measured behind a normal shock.  Note that the inputs required are impact pressure (or total pressure ) and static pressure. Air temperature input is not required.
