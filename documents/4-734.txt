DIIS

DIIS (direct inversion in the iterative subspace or direct inversion of the iterative subspace), also known as Pulay mixing, is an extrapolation technique. DIIS was developed by Peter Pulay in the field of computational quantum chemistry with the intent to accelerate and stabilize the convergence of the Hartreeâ€“Fock self-consistent field method.12
At a given iteration, the approach constructs a linear combination of approximate error vectors from previous iterations. The coefficients of the linear combination are determined so to best approximate, in a least squares sense, the null vector. The newly determined coefficients are then used to extrapolate the function variable for the next iteration.

At each iteration, an approximate error vector, , corresponding to the variable value,  is determined. After sufficient iterations, a linear combination of 
 
 
 
  previous error vectors is constructed



The DIIS method seeks to minimize the norm of  under the constraint that the coefficients sum to one. The reason why the coefficients must sum to one be can seen if we write the trial vector as the sum of the exact solution () and an error vector. In the DIIS approximation, we get:


 
 
  We minimize the second term while it is clear that the sum coefficients must be equal to one if we want to find the exact solution. The minimization is done by a Lagrange multiplier technique. Introducing an undetermined multiplier 
 
 
 
 , a Lagrangian is constructed as



Equating zero to the derivatives of 
 
 
 
  with respect to the coefficients and the multiplier leads to a system of 
 
 
linear equations to be solved for the 
 
 
 
  coefficients (and the Lagrange multiplier). The coefficients are then used to update the variable as
