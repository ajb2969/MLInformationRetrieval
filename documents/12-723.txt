   4-Hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase      4-Hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase   4-Hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (, isopentenyl-diphosphate:NADP+ oxidoreductase , LytB , (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate reductase , HMBPP reductase , IspH , LytB/IspH ) is an enzyme in the non-mevalonate pathway . It acts upon (E)-4-Hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (or "HMB-PP").   (1) isopentenyl diphosphate + NAD(P) + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate + NAD(P)H + H +   (2) dimethylallyl diphosphate + NAD(P) + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate + NAD(P)H + H +    4-Hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase is an iron - sulfur protein that contains either a [3Fe-4S] or a [4Fe-4S] cluster.
