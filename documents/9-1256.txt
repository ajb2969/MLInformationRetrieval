Unate function

A unate function is a type of boolean function which has monotonic properties. They have been studied extensively in switching theory.
A function 
 
 
 
  is said to be positive unate in 
 
 
 
  if for all possible values of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 



 
  Likewise, it is negative unate in 
 
 
 
  if


 
  If for every 
 
 
f is either positive or negative unate in the variable 
 
 
 
  then it is said to be unate (note that some 
 
 
 
  may be positive unate and some negative unate to satisfy the definition of unate function). A function is binate if it is not unate (i.e., is neither positive unate nor negative unate in at least one of its variables).
For example the Logical disjunction function or with boolean values used for true (1) and false (0) is positive unate.
NB: positive unateness can also be considered as passing the same slope (no change in the input) and negative unate is passing the opposite slope.... non unate is dependence on more than one input (of same or different slopes)
