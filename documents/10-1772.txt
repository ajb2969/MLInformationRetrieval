   Homocysteine desulfhydrase      Homocysteine desulfhydrase   In enzymology , a homocysteine desulfhydrase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-homocysteine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   hydrogen sulfide + NH 3 + 2-oxobutanoate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-homocysteine and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are hydrogen sulfide , NH 3 , and 2-oxobutanoate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-homocysteine hydrogen-sulfide-lyase (deaminating 2-oxobutanoate-forming) . Other names in common use include homocysteine desulfurase, L-homocysteine hydrogen-sulfide-lyase , and (deaminating) . This enzyme participates in nitrogen metabolism and sulfur metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  References     "  Category:EC 4.4.1  Category:Pyridoxal phosphate enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
