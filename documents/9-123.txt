   Sears–Haack body      Sears–Haack body   The Sears–Haack body is the shape with the lowest theoretical wave drag in supersonic flow, for a given body length and given volume. The mathematical derivation assumes small-disturbance (linearized) supersonic flow, which is governed by the Prandtl-Glauert equation . The derivation and shape were published independently by two separate researchers: Wolfgang Haack in 1941 and later by William Sears in 1947. 1  The theory indicates that the wave drag scales as the square of the second derivative of the area distribution,     D  wave   ∼    [    S  ′′    (  x  )    ]   2      similar-to   subscript  D  wave    superscript   delimited-[]     superscript  S  ′′   x    2     D_{\text{wave}}\sim[S^{\prime\prime}(x)]^{2}   (see full expression below), so for low wave drag it's necessary that    S   (  x  )       S  x    S(x)   be smooth. Thus, the Sears–Haack body is pointed at each end and grows smoothly to a maximum and then decreases smoothly toward the second point.

The theory has been generalized to slender but non-axisymmetric shapes by Robert T. Jones NACA Report 1284. In this extension, the area    S   (  x  )       S  x    S(x)   is defined on the Mach cone whose apex is at location   x   x   x   , rather than on the    x  =  constant      x  constant    x=\text{constant}   plane as assumed by Sears and Haack. Hence, Jones's theory makes it applicable to more complex shapes like entire supersonic aircraft.  Area rule  A superficially related concept is the Whitcomb area rule , which states that wave drag due to volume in transonic flow depends primarily on the distribution of total cross-sectional area, and for low wave drag this distribution must be smooth. A common misconception is that the Sears–Haack body has the ideal area distribution according to the area rule, but this is not correct. The Prandtl-Glauert equation which is the starting point in the Sears–Haack body shape derivation is not valid in transonic flow, which is where the Area rule applies.
