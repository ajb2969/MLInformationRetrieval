Circular coloring

[[File:J5 circular color.svg|300px|right|thumb|The Chromatic number of J5 Flower snark is 3, but the circular chromatic number is G, denoted 
 
 
 
  can be given by any of the following definitions, all of which are equivalent (for finite graphs).



 
  is the infimum over all real numbers 
 
 
 
  so that there exists a map from 
 
 
 
  to a circle of circumference 1 with the property that any two adjacent vertices map to points at distance 
 
 
 
  along this circle.


 
  is the infimum over all rational numbers 
 
 
 
  so that there exists a map from 
 
 
 
  to the cyclic group 
 
 
 
  with the property that adjacent vertices map to elements at distance 
 
 
 
  apart.
In an oriented graph, declare the imbalance of a cycle 
 
 
 
  to be 
 
 
 
  divided by the minimum of the number of edges directed clockwise and the number of edges directed counterclockwise. Define the imbalance of the oriented graph to be the maximum imbalance of a cycle. Now, 
 
 
 
  is the minimum imbalance of an orientation of 
 
 
 
 .

It is relatively easy to see that 
 
 
 
  (especially using 1. or 2.), but in fact 
 
 
 
 . It is in this sense that we view circular chromatic number as a refinement of the usual chromatic number.
Circular coloring was originally defined by , who called it "star coloring".
Coloring is dual to the subject of nowhere-zero flows and indeed, circular coloring has a natural dual notion: circular flows.
