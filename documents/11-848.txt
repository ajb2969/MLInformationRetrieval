Alcohol O-cinnamoyltransferase

In enzymology, an alcohol O-cinnamoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1-O-trans-cinnamoyl-beta-D-glucopyranose + ROH 
 
 
 
  alkyl cinnamate + glucose
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-O-trans-cinnamoyl-beta-D-glucopyranose and ROH, whereas its two products are alkyl cinnamate and glucose.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-O-trans-cinnamoyl-beta-D-glucopyranose:alcohol O-cinnamoyltransferase.
