Strictly standardized mean difference

In statistics, the strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) is a measure of effect size. SSMD is the mean divided by the standard deviation of a difference between two random values each from one of two groups. SSMD was initially proposed for quality control 1 and hit selection 2 in high-throughput screening (HTS) and has become a statistical parameter measuring effect sizes for the comparison of any two groups with random values. .3
Background
In high-throughput screens, quality control (QC) is critical. An important QC characteristic in an HTS assay is how much the positive controls, test compounds, and negative controls differ from one another in the assay. This QC characteristic can be evaluated using the comparison of two well types in HTS assays. Signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), signal-to-background ratio (S/B), and Z-factor have been adopted to evaluate the quality of HTS assays through the comparison of two investigated types of wells. However, S/B does not take into account any information on variability; and S/N can capture the variability only in one group and hence cannot assess the quality of assay when the two groups have different variabilities.4 Zhang JH et al.5 proposed Z-factor. The advantage of Z-factor over S/N and S/B is that it takes into account the variabilities in both compared groups. As a result, Z-factor has been broadly used as a QC metric in HTS assays.  The absolute sign in Z-factor makes it inconvenient to derive its statistical inference mathematically.
To derive a better interpretable parameter for measuring the differentiation between two groups, Zhang XHD6 proposed SSMD to evaluate the differentiation between a positive control and a negative control in HTS assays. SSMD has a probabilistic basis due to its strong link with d+-probability (i.e., the probability that the difference between two groups is positive).7 To some extent, the d+-probability is equivalent to the well-established probabilistic index P(X > Y) which has been studied and applied in many areas.8 9 10 11 12 Supported on its probabilistic basis, SSMD has been used for both quality control and hit selection in high-throughput screening.1314 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
Concept
Statistical parameter
As a statistical parameter, SSMD (denoted as 
 
 
 
 ) is defined as the ratio of mean to standard deviation of the difference of two random values respectively from two groups. Assume that one group with random values has mean

 
  and variance

 
  and another group has mean

 
  and variance

 
 . The covariance between the two groups is 
 
 
 
  Then, the SSMD for the comparison of these two groups is defined as27



If the two groups are independent,


 
  If the two independent groups have equal variances

 
 ,



In the situation where the two groups are correlated, a commonly used strategy to avoid the calculation of 
 
 
 
  is first to obtain paired observations from the two groups and then to estimate SSMD based on the paired observations. Based on a paired difference 
 
 
 
  with population mean

 
  and 
 
 
 
 , SSMD is



Statistical estimation
In the situation where the two groups are independent, Zhang XHD 28 derived the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE) and method-of-moment (MM) estimate of SSMD. Assume that groups 1 and 2 have sample mean

 
 , and sample variances

 
 . The MM estimate of SSMD is then29



When the two groups have normal distributions with equal variance, the uniformly minimal variance unbiased estimate (UMVUE) of SSMD is,30


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are the sample sizes in the two groups and

SSMD looks similar to t-statistic and Cohen's d, but they are different with one another as illustrated in.33
Application in high-throughput screening assays
SSMD is the ratio of mean to the standard deviation of the difference between two groups. When the data is preprocessed using log-transformation as we normally do in HTS experiments, SSMD is the mean of log fold change divided by the standard deviation of log fold change with respect to a negative reference. In other words, SSMD is the average fold change (on the log scale) penalized by the variability of fold change (on the log scale) 34 . For quality control, one index for the quality of an HTS assay is the magnitude of difference between a positive control and a negative reference in an assay plate. For hit selection, the size of effects of a compound (i.e., a small molecule or an siRNA) is represented by the magnitude of difference between the compound and a negative reference. SSMD directly measures the magnitude of difference between two groups. Therefore, SSMD can be used for both quality control and hit selection in HTS experiments.
Quality control
The number of wells for the positive and negative controls in a plate in the 384-well or 1536-well platform is normally designed to be reasonably large .35 Assume that the positive and negative controls in a plate have sample mean

 
 , sample variances

 
 , and sample sizes 
 
 
 
 . Usually, the assumption that the controls have equal variance in a plate holds. In such a case, The SSMD for assessing quality in that plate is estimated as 36


 
  where 
 
 
 
 . When the assumption of equal variance does not hold, the SSMD for assessing quality in that plate is estimated as 37


 
  If there are clearly outliers in the controls, the SSMD can be estimated as 38


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are the medians and median absolute deviations in the positive and negative controls, respectively.
The Z-factor based QC criterion is popularly used in HTS assays. However, it has been demonstrated that this QC criterion is most suitable for an assay with very or extremely strong positive controls.39 In an RNAi HTS assay, a strong or moderate positive control is usually more instructive than a very or extremely strong positive control because the effectiveness of this control is more similar to the hits of interest. In addition, the positive controls in the two HTS experiments theoretically have different sizes of effects. Consequently, the QC thresholds for the moderate control should be different from those for the strong control in these two experiments. Furthermore, it is common that two or more positive controls are adopted in a single experiment.40 Applying the same Z-factor-based QC criteria to both controls leads to inconsistent results as illustrated in the literatures.4142
The SSMD-based QC criteria listed in the following table43 take into account the effect size of a positive control in an HTS assay where the positive control (such as an inhibition control) theoretically has values less than the negative reference.




Quality Type

A: Moderate Control

B: Strong Control

C: Very Strong Control

D: Extremely Strong Control





Excellent



















Good



















Inferior



















Poor



















In application, if the effect size of a positive control is known biologically, adopt the corresponding criterion based on this table. Otherwise, the following strategy should help to determine which QC criterion should be applied: (i) in many small molecule HTS assay with one positive control, usually criterion D (and occasionally criterion C) should be adopted because this control usually has very or extremely strong effects; (ii) for RNAi HTS assays in which cell viability is the measured response, criterion D should be adopted for the controls without cells (namely, the wells with no cells added) or background controls; (iii) in a viral assay in which the amount of viruses in host cells is the interest, criterion C is usually used, and criterion D is occasionally used for the positive control consisting of siRNA from the virus.44
Similar SSMD-based QC criteria can be constructed for an HTS assay where the positive control (such as an activation control) theoretically has values greater than the negative reference. More details about how to apply SSMD-based QC criteria in HTS experiments can be found in a book.45
Hit selection
In an HTS assay, one primary goal is to select compounds with a desired size of inhibition or activation effect. The size of the compound effect is represented by the magnitude of difference between a test compound and a negative reference group with no specific inhibition/activation effects. A compound with a desired size of effects in an HTS screen is called a hit. The process of selecting hits is called hit selection. There are two main strategies of selecting hits with large effects.46 One is to use certain metric(s) to rank and/or classify the compounds by their effects and then to select the largest number of potent compounds that is practical for validation assays.47 4849 The other strategy is to test whether a compound has effects strong enough to reach a pre-set level. In this strategy, false-negative rates (FNRs) and/or false-positive rates (FPRs) must be controlled.50 51 5253 54
SSMD can not only rank the size of effects but also classify effects as shown in the following table based on the population value (
 
 
 
 ) of SSMD.55 56

The estimation of SSMD for screens without replicates differs from that for screens with replicates.5758

In a confirmatory or primary screen with replicates, for the i-th test compound with 
 
 
 
  replicates, we calculate the paired difference between the measured value (usually on the log scale) of the compound and the median value of a negative control in a plate, then obtain the mean

 
  and variance

 
  of the paired difference across replicates. The SSMD for this compound is estimated as 62


 
  In many cases, scientists may use both SSMD and average fold change for hit selection in HTS experiments. The dual-flashlight plot 63 can display both average fold change and SSMD for all test compounds in an assay and help to integrate both of them to select hits in HTS experiments 64 . The use of SSMD for hit selection in HTS experiments is illustrated step-by-step in 65
