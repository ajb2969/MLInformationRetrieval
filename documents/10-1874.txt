   TRNA sulfurtransferase      TRNA sulfurtransferase   In enzymology , a tRNA sulfurtransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-cysteine + 'activated' tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-serine + tRNA containing a thionucleotide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-cysteine and 'activated' tRNA , whereas its two products are L-serine and tRNA containing a thionucleotide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfurtransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-cysteine:tRNA sulfurtransferase . Other names in common use include transfer ribonucleate sulfurtransferase , RNA sulfurtransferase , ribonucleate sulfurtransferase , transfer RNA sulfurtransferase , and transfer RNA thiolase .
