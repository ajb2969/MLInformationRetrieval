Singularity spectrum

The singularity spectrum is a function used in Multifractal analysis to describe the fractal dimension of a subset of points of a function belonging to a group of points that have the same Holder exponent. Intuitively, the singularity spectrum gives a value for how "fractal" a set of points are in a function.
More formally, the singularity spectrum 
 
 
 
  of a function, 
 
 
 
 , is defined as:



Where 
 
 
 
  is the function describing the Holder exponent, 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  at the point 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is the Hausdorff dimension of a point set.
