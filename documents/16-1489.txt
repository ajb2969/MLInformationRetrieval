   Electrokinematics theorem      Electrokinematics theorem   The electrokinematics theorem 1 2 3 connects the velocity and the charge of carriers moving inside an arbitrary volume to the currents, voltages and power on its surface through an arbitrary irrotational vector . Since it contains, as a particular application, the Ramo-Shockley theorem , 4 5 the electrokinematics theorem is also known as Ramo-Shockly-Pellegrini theorem .  Statement  To introduce the electrokinematics theorem let us first list a few definitions: q j , r j and v j are the electric charge, position and velocity, respectively, at the time t of the j th charge carrier;    A  0     subscript  A  0    A_{0}   ,    E  =   -   ∇   A  0         E     normal-∇   subscript  A  0       E=-\nabla A_{0}   and   ε   ε   \varepsilon   are the electric potential , field , and permittivity , respectively,    J  q     subscript  J  q    J_{q}   ,     J  d   =    ε   ∂  E    /   ∂  t         subscript  J  d       ε    E      t      J_{d}=\varepsilon\partial E/\partial t   and    J  =    J  q   +   J  d        J     subscript  J  q    subscript  J  d      J=J_{q}+J_{d}   are the conduction, displacement and, in a 'quasi-electrostatic' assumption, total current density, respectively;    F  =   -   ∇  Φ        F     normal-∇  normal-Φ      F=-\nabla\Phi   is an arbitrary irrotational vector in an arbitrary volume   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   enclosed by the surface S, with the constraint that     ∇   (   ε  F   )    =  0       normal-∇    ε  F    0    \nabla(\varepsilon F)=0   . Now let us integrate over   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   the scalar product of the vector   F   F   F   by the two members of the above-mentioned current equation. Indeed, by applying the divergence theorem, the vector identity     a  ⋅   ∇  γ    =    ∇  ⋅   (   γ  a   )    -    γ  ∇   ⋅  a         normal-⋅  a   normal-∇  γ       normal-⋅  normal-∇    γ  a     normal-⋅    γ  normal-∇   a      a\cdot\nabla\gamma=\nabla\cdot(\gamma a)-\gamma\nabla\cdot a   , the above-mentioned constraint and the fact that     ∇  ⋅  J   =  0       normal-⋅  normal-∇  J   0    \nabla\cdot J=0   , we obtain the electrokinematics theorem in the first form       -    ∫  S      Φ  J   ⋅  d   S     =     ∫  Ω      J  q   ⋅  F    d  3   r    -    ∫  S      ε    ∂   A  0     ∂  t    F   ⋅  d   S             subscript   S      normal-⋅    normal-Φ  J   d   S         subscript   normal-Ω      normal-⋅   subscript  J  q   F    superscript  d  3   r      subscript   S      normal-⋅    ε       subscript  A  0      t    F   d   S       -\int_{S}\Phi J\cdot dS=\int_{\Omega}J_{q}\cdot Fd^{3}r-\int_{S}\varepsilon%

Moreover, let the surface S enclosing the volume   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   consist of a part     S  E   =    ∑   k  =  1   n    S  k         subscript  S  E     superscript   subscript     k  1    n    subscript  S  k      S_{E}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}S_{k}   covered by n electrodes and an uncovered part    S  R     subscript  S  R    S_{R}   .  According to the above definitions and boundary conditions, and to the superposition theorem , the second equation can be split into the contributions       -    ∫   S  E       Φ   J  q    ⋅  d   S     =     ∑   j  =  1    N   (  t  )         q  j    v  j    ⋅  F    (   r  j   )     +    ∑   j  =  1    M   (  t  )       ∫   S  R       ε   (    Φ    ∂   E  j     ∂  t     -     ∂   A   q  j      ∂  t    F    )    ⋅  d   S              subscript    subscript  S  E       normal-⋅    normal-Φ   subscript  J  q    d   S         superscript   subscript     j  1      N  t       normal-⋅     subscript  q  j    subscript  v  j    F    subscript  r  j       superscript   subscript     j  1      M  t      subscript    subscript  S  R       normal-⋅    ε      normal-Φ       subscript  E  j      t            subscript  A    q  j       t    F     d   S        -\int_{S_{E}}\Phi J_{q}\cdot dS=\sum_{j=1}^{N(t)}q_{j}v_{j}\cdot F(r_{j})+\sum%

The integrals of the above equations account for the displacement current, in particular across    S  R     subscript  S  R    S_{R}   .  Current and capacitance  One of the more meaningful application of the above equations is to compute the current       i  h   ≡   -    ∫   S  h      J  ⋅  d   S     =    i   q  h    +   i   V  h            subscript  i  h       subscript    subscript  S  h       normal-⋅  J  d   S             subscript  i    q  h     subscript  i    V  h        i_{h}\equiv-\int_{S_{h}}J\cdot dS=i_{qh}+i_{Vh}   ,  through an h th electrode of interest corresponding to the surface    S  h     subscript  S  h    S_{h}   ,    i   q  h      subscript  i    q  h     i_{qh}   and    i   V  h      subscript  i    V  h     i_{Vh}   being the current due to the carriers and to the electrode voltages, to be computed through third and fourth equations, respectively.  Open devices  Let us consider as a first example, the case of a surface S that is not completely covered by electrodes, i.e.,     S  R   ≠  0       subscript  S  R   0    S_{R}\neq 0   , and let us choose Dirichlet boundary conditions     Φ  =   Φ  h   =  1        normal-Φ   subscript  normal-Φ  h        1     \Phi=\Phi_{h}=1   on the h th electrode of interest and of     Φ  h   =  0       subscript  normal-Φ  h   0    \Phi_{h}=0   on the other electrodes so that, from the above equations we have       i   q  h    =     ∑   j  =  1    N   (  t  )         q  j    v  j    ⋅   F  h     (   r  j   )     +    ∑   j  =  1    M   (  t  )       ∫   S  R       ε   (     Φ  h     ∂   E  j     ∂  t     -     ∂   A   q  j      ∂  t     F  h     )    ⋅  d   S      =          subscript  i    q  h        superscript   subscript     j  1      N  t       normal-⋅     subscript  q  j    subscript  v  j     subscript  F  h     subscript  r  j       superscript   subscript     j  1      M  t      subscript    subscript  S  R       normal-⋅    ε       subscript  normal-Φ  h        subscript  E  j      t            subscript  A    q  j       t     subscript  F  h      d   S           absent     i_{qh}=\sum_{j=1}^{N(t)}q_{j}v_{j}\cdot F_{h}(r_{j})+\sum_{j=1}^{M(t)}\int_{S_%

Enclosed devices  A fifth case, historically significant, is that of electrodes that completely enclose the volume   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   of the device, i.e.     S  R   =  0       subscript  S  R   0    S_{R}=0   . Indeed, choosing again the Dirichlet boundary conditions of     Φ  h   =  1       subscript  normal-Φ  h   1    \Phi_{h}=1   on    S  h     subscript  S  h    S_{h}   and     Φ  h   =  0       subscript  normal-Φ  h   0    \Phi_{h}=0   on the other electrodes, from the equations for the open device we get the relationships       i  h   =     ∑   j  =  1    N   (  t  )         q  j    v  j    ⋅   F  h     (   r  j   )     +    ∑   k  =  1   n     C   h  k      d   V  h     d  t            subscript  i  h       superscript   subscript     j  1      N  t       normal-⋅     subscript  q  j    subscript  v  j     subscript  F  h     subscript  r  j       superscript   subscript     k  1    n      subscript  C    h  k        d   subscript  V  h      d  t         i_{h}=\sum_{j=1}^{N(t)}q_{j}v_{j}\cdot F_{h}(r_{j})+\sum_{k=1}^{n}C_{hk}\frac{%
 dV_{h}}{dt}   ,  with       C   h  k    =   -    ∫   S  k       ε   F  h    ⋅  d   S          subscript  C    h  k        subscript    subscript  S  k       normal-⋅    ε   subscript  F  h    d   S       C_{hk}=-\int_{S_{k}}\varepsilon F_{h}\cdot dS   ,  thus obtaining the Ramo-Shockly theorem as a particular application of the electrokinematics theorem, extended from the vacuum devices to any electrical component and material.  As the above relationships hold true also when    F   (  t  )       F  t    F(t)   depends on time, we can have a sixty application if we select as    F  =   F  V   =   -    ∑   k  =  1   n     V  k    (  t  )    ∇   ψ  k     (  r  )            F   subscript  F  V            superscript   subscript     k  1    n      subscript  V  k   t   normal-∇   subscript  ψ  k    r        F=F_{V}=-\sum_{k=1}^{n}V_{k}(t)\nabla\psi_{k}(r)   the electric field generated by the electrode voltages when there is no charge in   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   . Indeed, as the first equation can be written in the form       -    ∫  S      Φ  J   ⋅  d   S     =    ∫  Ω     J  ⋅  F    d  3   r            subscript   S      normal-⋅    normal-Φ  J   d   S       subscript   normal-Ω      normal-⋅  J  F    superscript  d  3   r      -\int_{S}\Phi J\cdot dS=\int_{\Omega}J\cdot Fd^{3}r   ,  from which we have        ∑   h  =  1   n     V  h    i  h     =    ∫  Ω     J  ⋅   F  V     d  3   r    ≡  W          superscript   subscript     h  1    n      subscript  V  h    subscript  i  h       subscript   normal-Ω      normal-⋅  J   subscript  F  V     superscript  d  3   r         W     \sum_{h=1}^{n}V_{h}i_{h}=\int_{\Omega}J\cdot F_{V}d^{3}r\equiv W   ,  where   W   W   W   corresponds to the power entering the device   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   across the electrodes (enclosing it). On the other side        ∫  Ω     (    E  ⋅   J  q    +   E  ⋅    ε   ∂  E     ∂  t      )    d  3   r    =    ∫  Ω     E  ⋅  J    d  3   r    ≡    d  Ξ    d  t            subscript   normal-Ω        normal-⋅  E   subscript  J  q     normal-⋅  E      ε    E      t       superscript  d  3   r      subscript   normal-Ω      normal-⋅  E  J    superscript  d  3   r             d  normal-Ξ     d  t       \int_{\Omega}(E\cdot J_{q}+E\cdot\frac{\varepsilon\partial E}{\partial t})d^{3%
 }r=\int_{\Omega}E\cdot Jd^{3}r\equiv\frac{d\Xi}{dt}   ,  gives the increment of the internal energy   Ξ   normal-Ξ   \Xi   in   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   in a unit of time,    E  =    F  V   +   E  q        E     subscript  F  V    subscript  E  q      E=F_{V}+E_{q}   being the total electric field of which    F  V     subscript  F  V    F_{V}   is due the electrodes and     E  q   =   -    ∇   ψ  q     (  r  ,  t  )          subscript  E  q        normal-∇   subscript  ψ  q     r  t       E_{q}=-\nabla\psi_{q}(r,t)   is due to the whole charge density in   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   with      ψ  q    (  r  ,  t  )    =  0         subscript  ψ  q    r  t    0    \psi_{q}(r,t)=0   over S . Then it is      ∫  Ω      E  q   ⋅  J    d  3   r    =  0        subscript   normal-Ω      normal-⋅   subscript  E  q   J    superscript  d  3   r    0    \int_{\Omega}E_{q}\cdot Jd^{3}r=0   , so that, according to such equations, we also verify the energy balance    W  =     d  Ξ   /  d   t       W        d  normal-Ξ   d   t     W=d\Xi/dt   by means of the electrokinematics theorem. With the above relationships the balance can be extended also to the open devices by taking into account the displacement current across    S  R     subscript  S  R    S_{R}   .  Fluctuations  A meaningful application of the above results is also the computation of the fluctuations of the current     i  h   =   i   q  h         subscript  i  h    subscript  i    q  h      i_{h}=i_{qh}   when the electrode voltages is constant, because this is useful for the evaluation of the device noise . To this end, we can exploit the first equation of section Open devices , because it concerns the more general case of an open device and it can be reduced to a more simply relationship. This happens for frequencies    f  =   ω  /   (   2  π   )    ≪   1  /   (   2  π   t  j    )          f    ω    2  π      much-less-than      1    2  π   subscript  t  j        f=\omega/(2\pi)\ll 1/(2\pi t_{j})   , (    t  j     subscript  t  j    t_{j}   being the transit time of the j th carrier across the device) because the in time integral of the above equation of the Fourier transform to be performed to compute the power spectral density (PSD) of the noise, the time derivatives provides no contribution. Indeed, according to the Fourier transform, this result derives from integrals such as      ∫  0   t  j     e  x  p   (   -   j  ω  t    )    (    ∂  Q   /   ∂  t    )   d  t    ≈    Q   (   t  j   )    -   Q   (  0  )           superscript   subscript   0    subscript  t  j      e  x  p      j  ω  t        Q     t    d  t        Q   subscript  t  j      Q  0      \int_{0}^{t_{j}}exp(-j\omega t)(\partial Q/\partial t)dt\approx Q(t_{j})-Q(0)   , in which     Q   (   t  j   )    =   Q   (  0  )    =  0          Q   subscript  t  j      Q  0        0     Q(t_{j})=Q(0)=0   . Therefore for the PSD computation we can exploit the relationships       i   q  h    =    ∑   j  =  1    N   (  t  )         q  j    v  j    ⋅   F  h     (   r  j   )     =   -    ∑   j  =  1    N   (  t  )       q  j     d   Φ  h    [    r  j    (  t  )    ]     d  t       =    ∫  Ω      J  q   ⋅  F    d  3   r           subscript  i    q  h      superscript   subscript     j  1      N  t       normal-⋅     subscript  q  j    subscript  v  j     subscript  F  h     subscript  r  j              superscript   subscript     j  1      N  t       subscript  q  j       d   subscript  normal-Φ  h    delimited-[]     subscript  r  j   t       d  t              subscript   normal-Ω      normal-⋅   subscript  J  q   F    superscript  d  3   r       i_{qh}=\sum_{j=1}^{N(t)}q_{j}v_{j}\cdot F_{h}(r_{j})=-\sum_{j=1}^{N(t)}q_{j}%
 \frac{d\Phi_{h}[r_{j}(t)]}{dt}=\int_{\Omega}J_{q}\cdot Fd^{3}r     Moreover, as it can be shown, 6 this happens also for    f  ≫   1  /   (   2  π   t  j    )       much-greater-than  f    1    2  π   subscript  t  j       f\gg 1/(2\pi t_{j})   , for instance when the j th carrier is stored for a long time    τ  j     subscript  τ  j    \tau_{j}   in a trap if the screening length due to the other carriers is small in comparison to    Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega    size. All the above considerations hold true for any size of    Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega    , including nanodevices. In particular we have a meaningful case when the device is a right parallelepiped or cylinder with    S  R     subscript  S  R    S_{R}   as lateral surface and u as the unit vector along its axis, with the bases    S   E  1      subscript  S    E  1     S_{E1}   and    S   E  2      subscript  S    E  2     S_{E2}   located at a distance L as electrodes, and with     S   E  1    →  u  →   S   E  2         normal-→   subscript  S    E  1    u    normal-→     subscript  S    E  2       S_{E1}\rightarrow u\rightarrow S_{E2}   . Indeed, choosing     F  h   =  F  =   -   u  /  L           subscript  F  h   F           u  L       F_{h}=F=-u/L   , from the above equation we finally obtain the current    i  =   i  1   =   i   q  1    =   -   i  2          i   subscript  i  1         subscript  i    q  1            subscript  i  2       i=i_{1}=i_{q1}=-i_{2}   ,      i  =    1  L     ∑   j  =  1    N   (  t  )       q  j    v   j  u       =    1  L     ∫  Ω     J   q  u     d  3   r           i      1  L     superscript   subscript     j  1      N  t       subscript  q  j    subscript  v    j  u                1  L     subscript   normal-Ω      subscript  J    q  u     superscript  d  3   r        i=\frac{1}{L}\sum_{j=1}^{N(t)}q_{j}v_{ju}=\frac{1}{L}\int_{\Omega}J_{qu}d^{3}r   ,  where    v   j  u      subscript  v    j  u     v_{ju}   and    J   q  u      subscript  J    q  u     J_{qu}   are the components of   v   v   v   and    J  q     subscript  J  q    J_{q}   along   u   u   u   . The above equations in their corpuscular form are particularly suitable for the investigation of transport and noise phenomena from the microscopic point of view, with the application of both the analytical approaches and numerical statistical methods, such as the Monte Carlo techniques . On the other side, in their collective form of the last terms, they are useful to connect, with a general and new method, the local variations of continuous quantities to the current fluctuation at the device terminals. This will be shown in the next sections.  Noise  Shot noise  Let us first evaluate the PSD    S  S     subscript  S  S    S_{S}   of the shot noise of the current    i  =   i   q  h        i   subscript  i    q  h      i=i_{qh}   for short circuited device terminals, i.e. when the    V  h     subscript  V  h    V_{h}   's are constant, by applying the third member of the first equation of the above Section. To this end, let us exploit the Fourier coefficient       D   (   ω  l   )    ≡    1   T    ′       ∫   -    T    ′    /  2      T    ′    /  2     Δ  i   (  t  )   e  x  p   (   -   j   ω  l   t    )   d  t           D   subscript  ω  l        1   superscript  T   normal-′       superscript   subscript        superscript  T   normal-′    2        superscript  T   normal-′    2      normal-Δ  i  t  e  x  p      j   subscript  ω  l   t    d  t       D(\omega_{l})\equiv\frac{1}{T^{^{\prime}}}\int_{-T^{^{\prime}}/2}^{T^{^{\prime%

If we define with    t   b  j      subscript  t    b  j     t_{bj}   and    (    t   b  j    +   t  j    )       subscript  t    b  j     subscript  t  j     (t_{bj}+t_{j})   the beginning and the end of the jth carrier motion inside   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   , we have either      Φ  h    [    r  j    (   t   b  j    )    ]    =  1         subscript  normal-Φ  h    delimited-[]     subscript  r  j    subscript  t    b  j       1    \Phi_{h}[r_{j}(t_{bj})]=1   and      Φ  h    [    r  j    (    t   b  j    +   t  j    )    ]    =  0         subscript  normal-Φ  h    delimited-[]     subscript  r  j      subscript  t    b  j     subscript  t  j       0    \Phi_{h}[r_{j}(t_{bj}+t_{j})]=0   or vice versa (the case of      Φ  h    [    r  j    (   t   b  j    )    ]    =    Φ  h    [    r  j    (    t   b  j    +   t  j    )    ]           subscript  normal-Φ  h    delimited-[]     subscript  r  j    subscript  t    b  j          subscript  normal-Φ  h    delimited-[]     subscript  r  j      subscript  t    b  j     subscript  t  j         \Phi_{h}[r_{j}(t_{bj})]=\Phi_{h}[r_{j}(t_{bj}+t_{j})]   give no contribution), so that from the first equations of the above and of this Section, we get       D   (   ω  l   )    ≡    q   T    ′      (    Δ   N  +    -   Δ   N  -     )          D   subscript  ω  l        q   superscript  T   normal-′         normal-Δ   superscript  N       normal-Δ   superscript  N         D(\omega_{l})\equiv\frac{q}{T^{^{\prime}}}(\Delta N^{+}-\Delta N^{-})   ,  where     N  +    (   N  -   )        superscript  N     superscript  N      N^{+}(N^{-})   is the number of the carriers (with equal charge q ) that start from (arrive on) the electrode of interest during the time interval     -    T    ′    /  2    ,    T    ′    /  2           superscript  T   normal-′    2       superscript  T   normal-′    2     -T^{^{\prime}}/2,T^{^{\prime}}/2   . Finally for     τ  c   ≪   t   j  m  i  n       much-less-than   subscript  τ  c    subscript  t    j  m  i  n      \tau_{c}\ll t_{jmin}   ,    τ  c     subscript  τ  c    \tau_{c}   being the correlation time, and for carriers with a motion that is statistically independent and a Poisson process we have     ⟨   Δ   N  +   Δ   N  -    ⟩   =  0       delimited-⟨⟩    normal-Δ   superscript  N    normal-Δ   superscript  N      0    \left\langle\Delta N^{+}\Delta N^{-}\right\rangle=0   ,     ⟨   Δ   N  +   Δ   N  +    ⟩   =   ⟨   N  +   ⟩        delimited-⟨⟩    normal-Δ   superscript  N    normal-Δ   superscript  N       delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  N       \left\langle\Delta N^{+}\Delta N^{+}\right\rangle=\left\langle N^{+}\right\rangle   and     ⟨   Δ   N  -   Δ   N  -    ⟩   =   ⟨   N  -   ⟩        delimited-⟨⟩    normal-Δ   superscript  N    normal-Δ   superscript  N       delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  N       \left\langle\Delta N^{-}\Delta N^{-}\right\rangle=\left\langle N^{-}\right\rangle   so that we obtain       S  S   =   2  q   (    I  +   +   I  -    )         subscript  S  S     2  q     superscript  I     superscript  I        S_{S}=2q(I^{+}+I^{-})   ,  where     I  +    (   I  -   )        superscript  I     superscript  I      I^{+}(I^{-})   is the average current due to the carriers leaving (reaching) the electrode. Therefore we recover and extend the Schottky's theorem 7 on shot noise. For instance for an ideal pn junction, or Schottky barrier diode , it is     I  +   =    I  0   e  x  p   (     q  v   /   k  B    T   )         superscript  I       subscript  I  0   e  x  p        q  v    subscript  k  B    T      I^{+}=I_{0}exp(qv/k_{B}T)   ,     I  -   =   I  0        superscript  I     subscript  I  0     I^{-}=I_{0}   , where    k  B     subscript  k  B    k_{B}   is the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature, v the voltage and    I  =    I  +   -   I  -        I     superscript  I     superscript  I       I=I^{+}-I^{-}   the total current. In particular, for    v  =  0      v  0    v=0   the conductance becomes    g  =   (     d  I   /  d   v   )   =    q   I  0    /   (    k  B   T   )          g        d  I   d   v            q   subscript  I  0       subscript  k  B   T       g=(dI/dv)=qI_{0}/(k_{B}T)   and the above equation gives       S  S   =   4   k  B   T  g        subscript  S  S     4   subscript  k  B   T  g     S_{S}=4k_{B}Tg   ,  that is the thermal noise at thermal equilibrium given by the Nyquist theorem . 8 If the carrier motions are correlated, the above equation has to be changed to the form (for     I  +   ≫   I  -      much-greater-than   superscript  I     superscript  I      I^{+}\gg I^{-}   )       S  S   =    F  a    (   2  q  I   )         subscript  S  S      subscript  F  a     2  q  I      S_{S}=F_{a}(2qI)   ,  where    F  a     subscript  F  a    F_{a}   is the so called Fano factor that can be both less than 1 (for instance in the case of carrier generation-recombination in nonideal pn junctions 9 ), and greater than 1 (as in the negative resistance region of resonant-tunneling diode, as a result of the electron-electron interaction being enhanced by the particular shape of the density of states in the well. 10 11 )  Thermal noise  Once again from the corpuscular point of view, let us evaluate the thermal noise with the autocorrelation function    ⟨   i   (  t  )   i   (   t  +  θ   )    ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩    i  t  i    t  θ      \left\langle i(t)i(t+\theta)\right\rangle   of    i   (  t  )       i  t    i(t)   by means of the second term of the second equation of section Fluctuations , that for the short circuit condition     V  1   =   V  2   =  0         subscript  V  1    subscript  V  2        0     V_{1}=V_{2}=0   (i.e., at thermal equilibrium) which implies     N   (  t  )    =   N  ¯         N  t    normal-¯  N     N(t)=\overline{N}   , becomes       ⟨   i   (  t  )   i   (   t  +  θ   )    ⟩   =     q  2    L  2      ∑   j  =  1    N  ¯       ⟨    v   j  u   2    (  t  )    ⟩   t   e  x  p   (   -    |  θ  |   /   τ  c     )      =      q  2    N  ¯    k  B   T     L  2   m    e  x  p   (   -    |  θ  |   /   τ  c     )           delimited-⟨⟩    i  t  i    t  θ          superscript  q  2    superscript  L  2      superscript   subscript     j  1     normal-¯  N       subscript   delimited-⟨⟩     superscript   subscript  v    j  u    2   t    t   e  x  p        θ    subscript  τ  c                    superscript  q  2    normal-¯  N    subscript  k  B   T      superscript  L  2   m    e  x  p        θ    subscript  τ  c         \left\langle i(t)i(t+\theta)\right\rangle=\frac{q^{2}}{L^{2}}\sum_{j=1}^{%

 \right|/\tau_{c})   ,  where m is the carrier effective mass and     τ  c   ≪   τ   j  m  i  n       much-less-than   subscript  τ  c    subscript  τ    j  m  i  n      \tau_{c}\ll\tau_{jmin}   . As    μ  =    q   τ  c    /   [   m   (   1  +   j  ω    )    ]        μ      q   subscript  τ  c     delimited-[]    m    1    j  ω         \mu=q\tau_{c}/[m(1+j\omega)]   and    G  =    q  μ   N  ¯    /   L  2        G      q  μ   normal-¯  N     superscript  L  2      G=q\mu\overline{N}/L^{2}   are the carrier mobility and the conductance of the device, from the above equation and the Wiener-Khintchine theorem 12 13 we recover the result       S  T   =   4   k  B   T  R  e   {   G   (   j  ω   )    }         subscript  S  T     4   subscript  k  B   T  R  e     G    j  ω        S_{T}=4k_{B}TRe\{G(j\omega)\}   ,  obtained by Nyquist from the second principle of the thermodynamics , i.e. by means of a macroscopic approach. 14  Generation-recombination (g-r) noise  A significant example of application of the macroscopic point of view expressed by the third term of the second equation of section Fluctuations is represented by the g-r noise generated by the carrier trapping-detrapping processes in device defects. In the case of constant voltages and drift current density     J   q  u    =  q  μ   n  q   E  ,   (  E  ≡   E  u   )      fragments   subscript  J    q  u     q  μ   subscript  n  q   E  normal-,   fragments  normal-(  E    subscript  E  u   normal-)     J_{qu}=q\mu n_{q}E,(E\equiv E_{u})   , that is by neglecting the above velocity fluctuations of thermal origin, from the mentioned equation we get      i  =    1  L     ∫  Ω    q  μ   n  q   E   d  3   r         i      1  L     subscript   normal-Ω     q  μ   subscript  n  q   E   superscript  d  3   r       i=\frac{1}{L}\int_{\Omega}q\mu n_{q}Ed^{3}r   ,  in which    n  q     subscript  n  q    n_{q}   is the carrier density, and its steady state value is     i  ¯   ≡  I  =   q  μ   n  q   E  A          normal-¯  i   I         q  μ   subscript  n  q   E  A      \overline{i}\equiv I=q\mu n_{q}EA   ,   A   A   A   being the device cross-section surface; furthermore, we use the same symbols for both the time averaged and the instantaneous quantities. Let us first evaluate the fluctuations of the current i , that from the above equation are        Δ  i   I   =    1  Ω    (     1   n  q      ∫  Ω    Δ   n  q    d  3   r     +    1  E     ∫  Ω    Δ  E   d  3   r     +    1  μ     ∫  Ω    Δ  μ   d  3   r      )            normal-Δ  i   I       1  normal-Ω         1   subscript  n  q      subscript   normal-Ω     normal-Δ   subscript  n  q    superscript  d  3   r         1  E     subscript   normal-Ω     normal-Δ  E   superscript  d  3   r         1  μ     subscript   normal-Ω     normal-Δ  μ   superscript  d  3   r         \frac{\Delta i}{I}=\frac{1}{\Omega}(\frac{1}{n_{q}}\int_{\Omega}\Delta n_{q}d^%

 \mu d^{3}r)   ,  where only the fluctuation terms are time dependent. The mobility fluctuations can be due to the motion or to the change of status of defects that we neglect here. Therefore we ascribe the origin of g-r noise to the trapping-detrapping processes that contribute to    Δ  i      normal-Δ  i    \Delta i   through the other two terms via the fluctuation of the electron number    χ  =   0  ,  1       χ   0  1     \chi=0,1   in the energy level    ε  t     subscript  ε  t    \varepsilon_{t}   of a single trap in the channel or in its neighborhood. Indeed the charge fluctuation    q  Δ  χ      q  normal-Δ  χ    q\Delta\chi   in the trap generates variations of    n  q     subscript  n  q    n_{q}   and of   E   E   E   . However, the variation    Δ  E      normal-Δ  E    \Delta E   does not contribute to    Δ  i      normal-Δ  i    \Delta i   because it is odd in the u direction, so that we get        Δ  i   I   =    1   Ω   n  q       ∫  Ω    Δ   n  q    d  3   r             normal-Δ  i   I       1    normal-Ω   subscript  n  q       subscript   normal-Ω     normal-Δ   subscript  n  q    superscript  d  3   r       \frac{\Delta i}{I}=\frac{1}{\Omega n_{q}}\int_{\Omega}\Delta n_{q}d^{3}r   ,  from which we obtain        Δ  i   I   =    1   Ω   n  q       ∫   δ  Ω     Δ   n  q   a   d  3   r     =   -    1   Ω   n  q     Δ  χ              normal-Δ  i   I       1    normal-Ω   subscript  n  q       subscript     δ  normal-Ω      normal-Δ   subscript  n  q   a   superscript  d  3   r                1    normal-Ω   subscript  n  q     normal-Δ  χ       \frac{\Delta i}{I}=\frac{1}{\Omega n_{q}}\int_{\delta\Omega}\Delta n_{q}ad^{3}%
 r=-\frac{1}{\Omega n_{q}}\Delta\chi   ,  where the reduction of the integration volume from   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   to the much smaller one    δ  Ω      δ  normal-Ω    \delta\Omega   around the defect is justified by the fact that the effects of    Δ   n  q       normal-Δ   subscript  n  q     \Delta n_{q}   and    Δ  E      normal-Δ  E    \Delta E   fade within a few multiples of a screening length, which can be small (of the order of nanometers 15 in graphene 16 ); from Gauss's theorem , we obtain also      ∫   δ  Ω     Δ   n  q    d  3   r    =   -   Δ  χ          subscript     δ  normal-Ω      normal-Δ   subscript  n  q    superscript  d  3   r        normal-Δ  χ      \int_{\delta\Omega}\Delta n_{q}d^{3}r=-\Delta\chi   and the r.h.s. of the equation. In it the variation    Δ  χ      normal-Δ  χ    \Delta\chi   occurs around the average value    χ  ¯     normal-¯  χ    \overline{\chi}   given by the Fermi-Dirac factor     χ  ¯   ≡  ϕ  =   {    [  1  +  e  x  p   [   (   ε  t   -   ε  f   )   /   k  B   T  ]   }    -  1        fragments   normal-¯  χ    ϕ    fragments  normal-{   superscript   fragments  normal-[  1   e  x  p   fragments  normal-[   fragments  normal-(   subscript  ε  t     subscript  ε  f   normal-)     subscript  k  B   T  normal-]   normal-}     1       \overline{\chi}\equiv\phi=\{[1+exp[(\varepsilon_{t}-\varepsilon_{f})/k_{B}T]\}%

The PSD    S  t     subscript  S  t    S_{t}   of the fluctuation    Δ  i      normal-Δ  i    \Delta i   due to a single trap then becomes      S  t   /   I  2    =     [   1  /   (   Ω   n  q    )    ]   2    S  χ           subscript  S  t    superscript  I  2       superscript   delimited-[]    1    normal-Ω   subscript  n  q      2    subscript  S  χ      S_{t}/I^{2}=[1/(\Omega n_{q})]^{2}S_{\chi}   , where     S  χ   =    4  ϕ   (   1  -  ϕ   )   τ   /   [   1  +    (   ω  τ   )   2    ]         subscript  S  χ       4  ϕ    1  ϕ   τ    delimited-[]    1   superscript    ω  τ   2        S_{\chi}=4\phi(1-\phi)\tau/[1+(\omega\tau)^{2}]   is the Lorentzian PSD of the random telegraph signal   χ   χ   \chi    17 and   τ   τ   \tau   is the trap relaxation time. Therefore, for a density    n  t     subscript  n  t    n_{t}   of equal and uncorrelated defects we have a total PSD    S   g  r      subscript  S    g  r     S_{gr}   of the g-r noise given by       S   g  r    =    4   I  2    n  t   ϕ   (   1  -  ϕ   )   τ    Ω   n  q  2    [   1  +    (   ω  τ   )   2    ]          subscript  S    g  r        4   superscript  I  2    subscript  n  t   ϕ    1  ϕ   τ     normal-Ω   subscript   superscript  n  2   q    delimited-[]    1   superscript    ω  τ   2         S_{gr}=\frac{4I^{2}n_{t}\phi(1-\phi)\tau}{\Omega n^{2}_{q}[1+(\omega\tau)^{2}]}   .  Flicker noise  When the defects are not equal, for any distribution of   τ   τ   \tau   (except a sharply peaked one, as in the above case of g-r noise), and even for a very small number of traps with large   τ   τ   \tau   , the total PSD    S  f     subscript  S  f    S_{f}   of i , corresponding to the sum of the PSD    S  t     subscript  S  t    S_{t}   of all the     n  t   Ω       subscript  n  t   normal-Ω    n_{t}\Omega   (statistically independent) traps of the device, becomes 18       S  f   =      n  t   B    Ω   n  q  2       I  2    f  γ          subscript  S  f          subscript  n  t   B     normal-Ω   superscript   subscript  n  q   2        superscript  I  2    superscript  f  γ       S_{f}=\frac{n_{t}B}{\Omega n_{q}^{2}}\frac{I^{2}}{f^{\gamma}}   ,  where    0.85  <  γ  <  1.15        0.85  γ       1.15     0.85<\gamma<1.15   down to the frequency     1  /  2   π   τ  M         1  2   π   subscript  τ  M     1/2\pi\tau_{M}   ,    τ  M     subscript  τ  M    \tau_{M}   being the largest   τ   τ   \tau   and    B   (     ε  f   /   k  B    T   )       B       subscript  ε  f    subscript  k  B    T     B(\varepsilon_{f}/k_{B}T)   a proper coefficient. In particular, for unipolar conducting materials (e.g., for electrons as carriers) it can be     n  q   ∝   e  x  p   (     ε  f   /   k  B    T   )       proportional-to   subscript  n  q     e  x  p       subscript  ε  f    subscript  k  B    T      n_{q}\propto exp(\varepsilon_{f}/k_{B}T)   and, for trap energy levels     ε  t   >   ε  f        subscript  ε  t    subscript  ε  f     \varepsilon_{t}>\varepsilon_{f}   , from     S  χ   ∝  ϕ  =   e  x  p   (     ε  f   /   k  B    T   )         proportional-to   subscript  S  χ   ϕ         e  x  p       subscript  ε  f    subscript  k  B    T       S_{\chi}\propto\phi=exp(\varepsilon_{f}/k_{B}T)   we also have     B   (     ε  f   /   k  B    T   )    ∝   e  x  p   (     ε  f   /   k  B    T   )       proportional-to    B       subscript  ε  f    subscript  k  B    T      e  x  p       subscript  ε  f    subscript  k  B    T      B(\varepsilon_{f}/k_{B}T)\propto exp(\varepsilon_{f}/k_{B}T)   , so that from the above equation we obtain, 19       S  f   =    α   I  2      N  q    f  γ          subscript  S  f       α   superscript  I  2       subscript  N  q    superscript  f  γ       S_{f}=\frac{\alpha I^{2}}{N_{q}f^{\gamma}}   ,  where    N  q     subscript  N  q    N_{q}   is the total number of the carriers and   α   α   \alpha   is a parameters that depends on the material, structure and technology of the device.  Extensions  Electromagnetic field  The shown electrokinetics theorem holds true in the 'quasi electrostatic' condition, that is when the vector potential can be neglected or, in other terms, when the squared maximum size of   ω   ω   \omega   is much smaller than the squared minimum wavelength of the electromagnetic field in the device. However it can be extended to the electromagnetic field in a general form. 20 In this general case, by means of the displacement current across the surface    S  R     subscript  S  R    S_{R}   it is possible, for instance, to evaluate the electromagnetic field radiation from an antenna. It holds true also when the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability depend on the frequency. Moreover the field     F   (  r  ,  t  )    =   -   ∇  Φ          F   r  t       normal-∇  normal-Φ      F(r,t)=-\nabla\Phi   other than the electric field in 'quasi electrostatic' conditions, can be any other physical irrotational field.  Quantum mechanics  Finally, the electrokinetics theorem holds true in the classical mechanics limit, because it requires the simultaneous knowledge of the position and velocity of the carrier, that is, as a result of the uncertainty principle , when its wave function is essentially non null in a volume smaller than that of device. Such a limit can however be overcome computing the current density according the quantum mechanical expression. 21 22  Notes   Bruno Pellegrini has been the first Electronic Engineering graduate at the University of Pisa, where he is currently Professor Emeritus.
