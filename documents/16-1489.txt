Electrokinematics theorem

The electrokinematics theorem123 connects the velocity and the charge of carriers moving inside an arbitrary volume to the currents, voltages and power on its surface through an arbitrary irrotational vector. Since it contains, as a particular application, the Ramo-Shockley theorem,45 the electrokinematics theorem is also known as Ramo-Shockly-Pellegrini theorem.
Statement
To introduce the electrokinematics theorem let us first list a few definitions: qj, rj and vj are the electric charge, position and velocity, respectively, at the time t of the jth charge carrier; 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the electric potential, field, and permittivity, respectively, 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the conduction, displacement and, in a 'quasi-electrostatic' assumption, total current density, respectively; 
 
 
 
  is an arbitrary irrotational vector in an arbitrary volume 
 
 
 
  enclosed by the surface S, with the constraint that 
 
 
 
 
 . Now let us integrate over 
 
 
 
  the scalar product of the vector 
 
 
 
  by the two members of the above-mentioned current equation. Indeed, by applying the divergence theorem, the vector identity 
 
 
 
 , the above-mentioned constraint and the fact that 
 
 
 
 , we obtain the electrokinematics theorem in the first form


 
  ,
which, taking into account the corpuscular nature of the current 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the Dirac delta function and N(t) is the carrier number in 
 
 
 
  at the time t, becomes


 
  .
A component 
 
 
 
 
  of the total electric potential 
 
 
 
  is due to the voltage 
 
 
 
  applied to the kth electrode on S, on which 
 
 
 
  (and with the other boundary conditions 
 
 
 
  on the other electrodes and for 
 
 
 
 
 ), and each component 
 
 
 
  is due to the jth charge carrier qj , being 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  over any electrode and for 
 
 
 
 
 . Moreover, let the surface S enclosing the volume 
 
 
 
  consist of a part 
 
 
 
  covered by n electrodes and an uncovered part 
 
 
 
 .
According to the above definitions and boundary conditions, and to the superposition theorem, the second equation can be split into the contributions


 
  ,


 
 ,
relative to the carriers and to the electrode voltages, respectively, 
 
 
 
  being the total number of carriers in the space, inside and outside 
 
 
 
 , at time t, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The integrals of the above equations account for the displacement current, in particular across 
 
 
 
 
 .
Current and capacitance
One of the more meaningful application of the above equations is to compute the current


 
  ,
through an hth electrode of interest corresponding to the surface 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  being the current due to the carriers and to the electrode voltages, to be computed through third and fourth equations, respectively.
Open devices
Let us consider as a first example, the case of a surface S that is not completely covered by electrodes, i.e., 
 
 
 
 
 , and let us choose Dirichlet boundary conditions

 
  on the hth electrode of interest and of 
 
 
 
  on the other electrodes so that, from the above equations we have





 
  ,
where 
 
 
 
 
  is relative to the above-mentioned boundary conditions and 
 
 
 
  is a capacitive coefficient of the hth electrode given by


 
  .


 
  is the voltage difference between the hth electrode and an electrode held to a constant voltage (DC), for instance, directly connected to ground or through a DC voltage source. The above equations hold true for the above Dirichlet conditions for 
 
 
 
  and for any other choice of boundary conditions on 
 
 
 
 
 .
A second case can be that in which 
 
 
 
  also on 
 
 
 
  so that such equations reduce to


 
  ,


 
  .
As a third case, exploiting also to the arbitrariness of 
 
 
 
 
  , we can choose a Neumann boundary condition of 
 
 
 
  tangent to 
 
 
 
  in any point. Then the equations become


 
  ,


 
  .
In particular, this case is useful when the device is a right parallelepiped, being 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the lateral surface and the bases, respectively.
As a fourth application let us assume 
 
 
 
  in the whole the volume 
 
 
 
 , i.e., 
 
 
 
  in it, so that from the first equation of Section 1 we have


 
  ,
which recover the Kirchhoff law with the inclusion the displacement current across the surface 
 
 
 
  that is not covered by electrodes.
Enclosed devices
A fifth case, historically significant, is that of electrodes that completely enclose the volume 
 
 
 
  of the device, i.e. 
 
 
 
  . Indeed, choosing again the Dirichlet boundary conditions of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  on the other electrodes, from the equations for the open device we get the relationships


 
  ,
with


 
  ,
thus obtaining the Ramo-Shockly theorem as a particular application of the electrokinematics theorem, extended from the vacuum devices to any electrical component and material.
As the above relationships hold true also when 
 
 
 
  depends on time, we can have a sixty application if we select as 
 
 
 
 
  the electric field generated by the electrode voltages when there is no charge in 
 
 
 
 . Indeed, as the first equation can be written in the form


 
  ,
from which we have


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  corresponds to the power entering the device 
 
 
 
 
  across the electrodes (enclosing it). On the other side


 
  ,
gives the increment of the internal energy 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  in a unit of time, 
 
 
 
  being the total electric field of which 
 
 
 
 
  is due the electrodes and 
 
 
 
  is due to the whole charge density in 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  over S. Then it is 
 
 
 
 , so that, according to such equations, we also verify the energy balance 
 
 
 
 
  by means of the electrokinematics theorem. With the above relationships the balance can be extended also to the open devices by taking into account the displacement current across 
 
 
 
 .
Fluctuations
A meaningful application of the above results is also the computation of the fluctuations of the current 
 
 
 
  when the electrode voltages is constant, because this is useful for the evaluation of the device noise. To this end, we can exploit the first equation of section Open devices, because it concerns the more general case of an open device and it can be reduced to a more simply relationship. This happens for frequencies 
 
 
 
 , (
 
 
 
  being the transit time of the jth carrier across the device) because the in time integral of the above equation of the Fourier transform to be performed to compute the power spectral density (PSD) of the noise, the time derivatives provides no contribution. Indeed, according to the Fourier transform, this result derives from integrals such as 
 
 
 
 
  , in which 
 
 
 
 . Therefore for the PSD computation we can exploit the relationships



Moreover, as it can be shown,6 this happens also for 
 
 
 
 , for instance when the jth carrier is stored for a long time 
 
 
 
  in a trap if the screening length due to the other carriers is small in comparison to 

 size. All the above considerations hold true for any size of 

, including nanodevices. In particular we have a meaningful case when the device is a right parallelepiped or cylinder with 
 
 
 
  as lateral surface and u as the unit vector along its axis, with the bases 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  located at a distance L as electrodes, and with 
 
 
 
 
 . Indeed, choosing 
 
 
 
 , from the above equation we finally obtain the current 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  ,
where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are the components of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  along 
 
 
 
 . The above equations in their corpuscular form are particularly suitable for the investigation of transport and noise phenomena from the microscopic point of view, with the application of both the analytical approaches and numerical statistical methods, such as the Monte Carlo techniques. On the other side, in their collective form of the last terms, they are useful to connect, with a general and new method, the local variations of continuous quantities to the current fluctuation at the device terminals. This will be shown in the next sections.
Noise
Shot noise
Let us first evaluate the PSD 
 
 
 
  of the shot noise of the current 
 
 
 
 
  for short circuited device terminals, i.e. when the 
 
 
 
 's are constant, by applying the third member of the first equation of the above Section. To this end, let us exploit the Fourier coefficient



and the relationship



where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  in the second term and 
 
 
 
  in the third. If we define with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the beginning and the end of the jth carrier motion inside 
 
 
 
 , we have either 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  or vice versa (the case of 
 
 
 
  give no contribution), so that from the first equations of the above and of this Section, we get


 
  ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the number of the carriers (with equal charge q) that start from (arrive on) the electrode of interest during the time interval 
 
 
 
 
 . Finally for 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  being the correlation time, and for carriers with a motion that is statistically independent and a Poisson process we have 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  so that we obtain


 
  ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the average current due to the carriers leaving (reaching) the electrode. Therefore we recover and extend the Schottky's theorem7 on shot noise. For instance for an ideal pn junction, or Schottky barrier diode, it is 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  is the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature, v the voltage and 
 
 
 
  the total current. In particular, for 
 
 
 
  the conductance becomes 
 
 
 
  and the above equation gives


 
  ,
that is the thermal noise at thermal equilibrium given by the Nyquist theorem.8 If the carrier motions are correlated, the above equation has to be changed to the form (for 
 
 
 
 
 )


 
  ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the so called Fano factor that can be both less than 1 (for instance in the case of carrier generation-recombination in nonideal pn junctions9), and greater than 1 (as in the negative resistance region of resonant-tunneling diode, as a result of the electron-electron interaction being enhanced by the particular shape of the density of states in the well.1011)
Thermal noise
Once again from the corpuscular point of view, let us evaluate the thermal noise with the autocorrelation function 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  by means of the second term of the second equation of section Fluctuations, that for the short circuit condition 
 
 
 
 
  (i.e., at thermal equilibrium) which implies 
 
 
 
 , becomes


 
  ,
where m is the carrier effective mass and 
 
 
 
 . As 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are the carrier mobility and the conductance of the device, from the above equation and the Wiener-Khintchine theorem1213 we recover the result


 
  ,
obtained by Nyquist from the second principle of the thermodynamics, i.e. by means of a macroscopic approach.14
Generation-recombination (g-r) noise
A significant example of application of the macroscopic point of view expressed by the third term of the second equation of section Fluctuations is represented by the g-r noise generated by the carrier trapping-detrapping processes in device defects. In the case of constant voltages and drift current density 
 
 
 
 , that is by neglecting the above velocity fluctuations of thermal origin, from the mentioned equation we get


 
  ,
in which 
 
 
 
  is the carrier density, and its steady state value is 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  being the device cross-section surface; furthermore, we use the same symbols for both the time averaged and the instantaneous quantities. Let us first evaluate the fluctuations of the current i, that from the above equation are


 
  ,
where only the fluctuation terms are time dependent. The mobility fluctuations can be due to the motion or to the change of status of defects that we neglect here. Therefore we ascribe the origin of g-r noise to the trapping-detrapping processes that contribute to 
 
 
 
  through the other two terms via the fluctuation of the electron number 
 
 
 
  in the energy level 
 
 
 
 
  of a single trap in the channel or in its neighborhood. Indeed the charge fluctuation 
 
 
 
  in the trap generates variations of 
 
 
 
  and of 
 
 
 
 . However, the variation 
 
 
 
  does not contribute to 
 
 
 
 
  because it is odd in the u direction, so that we get


 
  ,
from which we obtain


 
  ,
where the reduction of the integration volume from 
 
 
 
  to the much smaller one 
 
 
 
  around the defect is justified by the fact that the effects of 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  fade within a few multiples of a screening length, which can be small (of the order of nanometers15 in graphene16); from Gauss's theorem, we obtain also 
 
 
 
  and the r.h.s. of the equation. In it the variation 
 
 
 
  occurs around the average value 
 
 
 
  given by the Fermi-Dirac factor 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  being the Fermi level. The PSD 
 
 
 
  of the fluctuation 
 
 
 
  due to a single trap then becomes 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  is the Lorentzian PSD of the random telegraph signal 
 
 
17 and 
 
 
 
  is the trap relaxation time. Therefore, for a density 
 
 
 
  of equal and uncorrelated defects we have a total PSD 
 
 
 
  of the g-r noise given by


 
  .
Flicker noise
When the defects are not equal, for any distribution of 
 
 
 
  (except a sharply peaked one, as in the above case of g-r noise), and even for a very small number of traps with large 
 
 
 
 , the total PSD 
 
 
 
  of i, corresponding to the sum of the PSD 
 
 
 
  of all the 
 
 
 
 
  (statistically independent) traps of the device, becomes18


 
  ,
where 
 
 
 
  down to the frequency 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  being the largest 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  a proper coefficient. In particular, for unipolar conducting materials (e.g., for electrons as carriers) it can be 
 
 
 
  and, for trap energy levels 
 
 
 
 , from 
 
 
 
  we also have 
 
 
 
 
 , so that from the above equation we obtain,19


 
  ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the total number of the carriers and 
 
 
 
  is a parameters that depends on the material, structure and technology of the device.
Extensions
Electromagnetic field
The shown electrokinetics theorem holds true in the 'quasi electrostatic' condition, that is when the vector potential can be neglected or, in other terms, when the squared maximum size of 
 
 
 
  is much smaller than the squared minimum wavelength of the electromagnetic field in the device. However it can be extended to the electromagnetic field in a general form.20 In this general case, by means of the displacement current across the surface 
 
 
 
 
  it is possible, for instance, to evaluate the electromagnetic field radiation from an antenna. It holds true also when the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability depend on the frequency. Moreover the field 
 
 
 
  other than the electric field in 'quasi electrostatic' conditions, can be any other physical irrotational field.
Quantum mechanics
Finally, the electrokinetics theorem holds true in the classical mechanics limit, because it requires the simultaneous knowledge of the position and velocity of the carrier, that is, as a result of the uncertainty principle, when its wave function is essentially non null in a volume smaller than that of device. Such a limit can however be overcome computing the current density according the quantum mechanical expression.2122
