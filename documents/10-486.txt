   D-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase      D-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a D-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-arabinose + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-arabinono-1,4-lactone + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-arabinose and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are D-arabinono-1,4-lactone , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-arabinose:NAD + 1-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include NAD + -pentose-dehydrogenase , and arabinose(fucose)dehydrogenase .
