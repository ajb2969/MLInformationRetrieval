Integer sequence prime

In mathematics, an integer sequence prime is a prime number found as a member of an integer sequence. For example, the 8th Delannoy number, 265729, is prime. A challenge in empirical mathematics is to identify large prime values in rapidly growing sequences.
A common subclass of integer sequence primes are constant primes, formed by taking a constant real number and considering prefixes of its decimal representation, omitting the decimal point. For example, the first 6 decimal digits of the constant π, approximately 3.14159265, form the prime number 314159, which is therefore known as a pi-prime. Similarly, a constant prime based on e is called an e-prime.
Other examples of integer sequence primes include:

Cullen prime – a prime that appears in the sequence of Cullen numbers 
 
 

Factorial prime – a prime that appears in either of the sequences 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 

Fermat prime – a prime that appears in the sequence of Fermat numbers 
 
 

Fibonacci prime – a prime that appears in the sequence of Fibonacci numbers.
Lucas prime – a prime that appears in the Lucas numbers.
Mersenne prime – a prime that appears in the sequence of Mersenne numbers 
 
 

Primorial prime – a prime that appears in either of the sequences 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 

Pythagorean prime – a prime that appears in the sequence 
 
 

Woodall prime – a prime that appears in the sequence of Woodall numbers 
 
 


The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences includes many sequences corresponding to the prime subsequences of well-known sequences, for example A001605 for Fibonacci numbers that are prime.
