   Heinz mean      Heinz mean   In mathematics, the Heinz mean (named after E. Heinz 1 ) of two non-negative real numbers  A and B , was defined by Bhatia 2 as:         H  x    (  A  ,  B  )    =      A  x    B   1  -  x     +    A   1  -  x     B  x     2    .         subscript  H  x    A  B           superscript  A  x    superscript  B    1  x        superscript  A    1  x     superscript  B  x     2     H_{x}(A,B)=\frac{A^{x}B^{1-x}+A^{1-x}B^{x}}{2}.     with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/2.  For different values of x , this Heinz mean interpolates between the arithmetic ( x = 0) and geometric ( x = 1/2) means such that for 0  \sqrt{A B} = H_{1/2}(A, B)  The Heinz mean may also be defined in the same way for positive semidefinite matrices , and satisfies a similar interpolation formula. 3 4  See also   Mean  Muirhead's inequality  Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means   References  "  Category:Means     E.
