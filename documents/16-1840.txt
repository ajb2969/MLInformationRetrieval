   Draft:Chow variety      Draft:Chow variety   In algebraic geometry, Chow variety is an algebraic variety parametrizing effective cycles of fixed dimension and degree.  Chow points  Let    V  =   Γ   (   𝐏  n   ,    𝒪   𝐏  n     (  1  )    )        V    normal-Γ    superscript  𝐏  n      subscript  𝒪   superscript  𝐏  n    1       V=\Gamma(\mathbf{P}^{n},\mathcal{O}_{\mathbf{P}^{n}}(1))   . By definition, a Chow point is a divisor on       𝐏  n   ˇ   =   𝐏   (   V  *   )     .       normal-ˇ   superscript  𝐏  n      𝐏   superscript  V       \check{\mathbf{P}^{n}}=\mathbf{P}(V^{*}).     Relation to Hilbert scheme  There is always a map (called the cycle map )       𝐇𝐢𝐥𝐛  →  𝐂𝐲𝐜𝐥   ,   Z  ↦   [  Z  ]       formulae-sequence   normal-→  𝐇𝐢𝐥𝐛  𝐂𝐲𝐜𝐥    maps-to  Z   delimited-[]  Z      \mathbf{Hilb}\to\mathbf{Cycl},\,Z\mapsto[Z]   from the Hilbert scheme to the Chow variety .  Chow quotient  a Chow quotient parametrizes closures of generic orbits . It is constructed as a closed subvariety of a Chow variety .  Kapranov's theorem says that the moduli space      M  ¯    0  ,  n      subscript   normal-¯  M    0  n     \overline{M}_{0,n}   of stable genus-zero curves with n marked points is the Chow quotient of Grassmannian    Gr   (  2  ,   ℂ  n   )      Gr  2   superscript  ℂ  n     \operatorname{Gr}(2,\mathbb{C}^{n})   by the standard maximal torus.
