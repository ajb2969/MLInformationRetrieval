Draft:Chow variety

In algebraic geometry, Chow variety is an algebraic variety parametrizing effective cycles of fixed dimension and degree.
Chow points
Let 
 
 
 
 . By definition, a Chow point is a divisor on 
 
 

Relation to Hilbert scheme
There is always a map (called the cycle map)


 
  from the Hilbert scheme to the Chow variety.
Chow quotient
a Chow quotient parametrizes closures of generic orbits. It is constructed as a closed subvariety of a Chow variety.
Kapranov's theorem says that the moduli space

 
  of stable genus-zero curves with n marked points is the Chow quotient of Grassmannian 
 
 
 
  by the standard maximal torus.
