Draft:HedgeSPA



HedgeSPA is a private company that makes investment analytics software. The founder and CEO of HedgeSPA is Bernard Lee, an Asian-American author and former finance professor, who maintains hands-on involvement with the research and development of the HedgeSPA Platform.
The primary product of the Company is a cloud-based investment analytics platform - HedgeSPA Platform. The Company built its investment analytics platform with R&D grants awarded by the National Research Foundation (NRF)1 as well as the Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board (SPRING) in Singapore 2. The mission of the project is to "democratize" access to investment analytics that only the largest institutional investors can afford to build in-house, and are sold only to a highly exclusive circle of asset managers at subscription rates of at least US$ 1 million per year 3. The platform delivers the latest techniques in investment analytics to users using native web-based technology.[2]
Dr. Lee was a former Managing Director in the portfolio management group of investment firm BlackRock, where he won an industry award for his investment analytics implementation there 4. He was also a finance professor in the US and in Singapore, who had presented his research at leading venues including the American Economic Association, American Statistical Association and the Russian Academy of Sciences. 5
HedgeSPA was named a potential industry disruptor in Financial Technology (FinTech) by Forbes in 2014. 6 In 2015, the company was named a finalist/nominee for 5 FinTech industry awards, and was shortlisted for the prestigious Red Herring Top 100 Asia. Research articles on market and economic scenarios published by the Company are regularly cited by the traditional financial media.
History
2003: Bernard Lee submitted his PhD dissertation to Imperial College London. Two chapters from his dissertation were published by Risk Publications in 2004. 7 The ideas described in his dissertation were the foundation of the investment analytics driving the HedgeSPA Platform. 8
2004: Bernard Lee received his PhD degree after formal examination by external examiner Professor Michael Dempster (Director of Financial Research Centre at Cambridge University). Bernard Lee joined BlackRock. 9
2005: Bernard Lee was awarded the “Intel Best Risk Analytics Initiative” by Risk/Waters for his investment analytics implementation at BlackRock. 10
2006: The US$ 9B US hedge fund Amaranth collapsed. BlackRock exited just in time right before the collapse, partly thanks to the analytics implemented by Dr. Lee to monitor Amaranth. That incident was memorialized by a popular professional book entitled “Hedge Hog”. 11
2007: BlackRock commenced marketing of Dr. Lee’s analytics to top US pension plans.
2009: Bernard Lee was appointed a faculty member at the Singapore Management University. He submitted a successful grant application to the Prime Minister’s Office in Singapore to start HedgeSPA, where he could further improve on ideas behind his doctoral dissertation, and move those analytics to the cloud to facilitate wider access by users. 12
2011: HedgeSPA was awarded the second stage of its R&D grant by SPRING (Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board) Singapore. The Company was formed and spun out of the Singapore Management University, as required by the grant program. The team moved to Block 71, the innovation hub of Singapore, at premises managed by NUS Enterprise (an arm of the National University Of Singapore). 13
2013: The Company began to establish its presence in North America. 14
2014: The Company completed all grant formalities in Singapore. It was mentioned by Forbes as a potential industry disrupter in financial technology. 15
2015: The Company began to receive nominations for multiple industry awards in financial technology. It moved into its current premise at 599 Second Street in San Francisco and began large implementation projects at global sites. The company was shortlisted by Red Herring Top 100 Asia.
Methodology
The purpose of this section is to describe the type of investment analytics methodologies used by HedgeSPA. These methodologies are different from customary methodologies used by the investment industry: e.g. They use fourth-order mathematics and statistics where applicable and as a result they cannot be easily replicated on a spreadsheet by users on their own: 16:
Asset Selection
Alpha Universe Comparison
Under Asset Selection, for example, provides Alpha Universe Comparison. It allows investors to compare the alpha performance of an investment against its peers 17 . Alpha takes the volatility and the risk-adjusted performance of a mutual fund into consideration18. The excess return of the fund relative to the return of the benchmark index is a fund's alpha. Beta, measuring the volatility of one portfolio in comparison to the whole market 19, is cheap, and investors don't want to be charged for it. Within the Alpha Universe Comparison table, there are four results columns 20 :

Alpha Excess of Universe - Excess monthly returns relative to universe composite (arithmetic average return computed from available monthly returns) over the most recent 2 years of history. (Products with less than 1 year of data will be excluded from the universe.)
Avg Alpha Excess of Style - Average of all monthly returns relative to style composite (computed from style replication models) over the most recent 2 years of history).
Sig Alpha Excess of Style - Average of only statistically-significant monthly returns relative to style composite (computed from style replication models) over the most recent 2 years of history.
Significant - Result of the Percentage of Significant Alphas Required test.

Some features of HedgeSPA's Alpha Universe Comparison are:

It allows user to define Universe flexibly, whether it is a country or a continent, where most products use "one size fits all".
Beta sets are normalized for users, demonstrate statistical significance, and are easy to use even if the "scanning" is almost everyday.
In progress, it constructs balance sheet factors. It can also support sentiment factors. It also has more advanced data about proprietary factors.
In addition to time series regression, it allows cross sections regression or mixed regression.
The integrated technology allows user to accomplish creating hypothetic portfolios, backtesting and conducting scenario analysis all at once, instead of doing it piece by piece.

Portfolio Rebalancing
Scenario Analytics
The Scenario Analytics tool allows users to explore the possible statistical impact of various market scenarios on their portfolio21. HedgeSPA's newsletter 22 provides scenarios related to the recent news, and the platform transform each news article into a multi-asset scenario models. This tool let the user select from a list of possible factors, specify their market view with a statistical price 'shock', and then examine the potential statistical result on their portfolio based on HedgeSPA's multi-asset scenario models 23.
First, within each multi-asset scenario, the user can select standard factors in each asset category: Equity, Bond, Foreign Exchange and Commodity. For each selected factor, the current value of the chosen index will be displayed, followed by the new value after the factor shock, the change in numerical terms and the change in percentage terms.
Users can then define the statistical 'shock' to that factor, or adjusted the magnitude of the shock based on their own views. The change can be displayed in terms of either percentage change or in absolute numerical terms. Our default changes are computed based on statistical methods, such as regression.
To analyze one scenario step by step, the method is roughly the following:

The investor wants to understand how Greek default would affect his/her portfolio, for example.
The investor needs to figure out how Greek default would affect market factors, such as S&P 500, 10-year T-Note, etc.
The investor needs to figure out how each market factors will affect each of his/her products.

HedgeSPA platform includes more than 15,000 combinations of market factors, and it runs equal amount, if not more, of regression with time series in the backstage. Therefore, when user adjusts the affected combinations and magnitude of the shock, the platform recalls its stored beta for such regression, and provide resulted specialized factors in the portfolio that are statistically valid.
Alternative Sharpe Ratio
The Sharpe Ratio, developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe, is used to calculate risk-adjusted return, and it has become the industry standard. 24 Alternative Sharpe Ratio (ASR) is similar to Sharpe Ratio but incorporates the appropriate cross moment information including skewness and excess kurtosis, and is a robust departure from the assumption of normality in portfolio returns. It is calculated as below: 25 $ASR = {\sum_i (R_{i,A} - R_f) w_i \over Z_{\pi}^- \sigma_{\pi,A}} + {1 \over 2}{\sum_i w_i(Z_i^+ \sigma_{i,A})^2 \over Z_{\pi}^- \sigma_{\pi,A}} - {1 \over 2}Z_{\pi}^- \sigma_{\pi,A}$

$Z_{\pi}^+ = {max(Z_{cf\pi}(Z_{\alpha}^+),0) \over Z_{\alpha}^+} , Z_{\pi}^- = {min(Z_{cf\pi}(Z_{\alpha}^-),0 \over Z_{\alpha}^-}$
Cornish-Fisher Expansion: 26$Z_{cf\pi}(Z_{\alpha}) = Z_{\alpha}+{1 \over 6}(Z_{\alpha}^2 -1)S_{\pi}+{1 \over 24}(Z_{\alpha}^3 -3Z_{\alpha})(K_{\pi}-3) - {1 \over 36}(2Z_{\alpha}^3-5Z_{\alpha})S_{\pi}^2$

S: Skewness; K:Excess Kurtosis = Plain Kurtosis-3

If there is no non-normality, ASR reverts back to SR. Since S=0 and Plain Kurtosis=3.

Tail Risk Attribution
Risk Attribution compares the position weight of each investment to its PCTR (percentage contribution to tail-risk) to let investors explore which investments are disproportionately risky relative to their weight. 27 Tail-risk arises when the possibility that an investment will move more than three standard deviations from the mean is greater than what is shown by a normal distribution. 28 PCTR give information about the fraction of total risk contributed by each of the funds in the portfolio. It is computed by multiplying the weight of the investment by their marginal contribution statistics and dividing the total by the appropriate risk measure. PCTR uses Standard Deviation as the risk measure, and they sum up to 100%. 29
Return Attribution
Return Attribution compares an investment’s Historical Return with its Implied Return, or the return required to justify the risk it contributes to the portfolio. 30
Implied Returns are the returns of each product that the user will get assuming that the target portfolio weights yield the optimal target portfolio (e.g. portfolio with the highest Sharpe Ratio). See the mathematical definition below:31 $Implied  
 Return = SR * {\Delta \sigma_{pf} \over \Delta W_i} + R_f = {R_{pf} - R_f \over {\sigma}_{pf}} * {\Delta \sigma_{pf} \over \Delta W_i} + R_f$

$SR$: Portfolio Sharpe Ratio
$\sigma_{pf}$: Portfolio Volatility
$W_i$: Weight of the $i^{th}$ product in target portfolio
$R_f$: Risk free rate
The system assumes an annual risk free rate of 2%.

Return Attribution with Scenarios can be used to see which investments may justify their risks under the projected market scenario. A list of different scenarios is offered to the user. Once a scenario is selected, the tool changes to compare the forward-looking Scenario Return with the forward-looking Scenario Implied Return. 32
Decision/Execution
Hedging
By using our hedging tool, users can select any desirable combinations of investment products to construct a hedging palette. As Dr. Lee mentioned, "No matter how simple or complex the hedging methodology, hedging can almost always be translated into an equivalent optimization problem with different objective functions." 33 Most platform does not support arbitrary numbers of objectives. In comparison, HedgeSPA platform implements 6 hedging objectives that its founder has examined in his paper 34, so that the platform will recommend the appropriate positions in the hedging palette (such to user constraints including cash constraint) and the hedged portfolio will meet one of the following objectives:
Min VaR: minimizing Value-at-Risk: this objective function is often used in the generalized delta solution. 35
Min CVaR(95%): minimizing Conditional Value-at-Risk at 95% confidence level. 36
Max SR: maximizing portfolio Sharpe Ratio
Max ASR: maximizing the portfolio Alternative Sharpe Ratio: an advanced measure of Sharpe Ratio adjusted for both positive skewness and downside tail risk. 37
Min Variance: minimizing Portfolio Variance (or squared residuals)
Min MaxDD: minimizing the Maximum Drawdown of the Portfolio: MaxDD% is used to describe the percentage drop from the peak to the trough. Using MaxDD as a measure of risk, the optimization procedure will find an estimate of the hedge ratio h that can achieve the lowest possible MaxDD. 38
The detailed methodologies are below:39
Min VaR: minimizing Value-at-Risk 40
A portfolio’s value-at-risk is defined as the maximum loss in the portfolio value over a period of time, at a given level of confidence. 41 $VaR_{\pi,a}:=-F^{-1}(\alpha),$
where$F(y) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{y}  {1 \over {\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_{\pi}}} e^{-{1 \over 2\sigma_{\pi}^2}(x-\mu_{\pi}^2)} \,dx$
Min CVaR(95%): minimizing Conditional Value-at-Risk at 95% confidence level. 42
The conditional value at risk (also known as expected shortfall) is the expected loss over a specified time horizon under the normal distribution given that the loss is greater or equal to the Value at Risk (VaR ).
The portfolio $cVaR$ at $100\alpha%$ can be computed as:43 $cVaR_{\pi,\alpha} = \mathbb{E}(VaR_{\pi,\gamma}|0<\gamma\leqslant\alpha)$
Max SR: maximizing portfolio Sharpe Ratio 44
Sharpe Ratio (SR) measures the risk-adjusted performance of a portfolio. The portfolio’s Sharpe Ratio (SR) can be computed as following:45 $SR={\mu_{\pi,A}-R_f \over \sigma_{\pi,A}}$

$\mu_{\pi,A}$: Expected portfolio return.
$R_f$: The risk-free market rate.
$\sigma_{\pi,A}$: The standard deviation of the portfolio

Max ASR: maximizing the portfolio Alternative Sharpe Ratio
See the function of ASR in previous section.
Min Variance: minimizing Portfolio Variance (or squared residuals) 46 $min_h {\Sigma}_{1 \leqslant t \leqslant T} (pherr(t))^2$
Min MaxDD: minimizing the Maximum Drawdown of the Portfolio 47
The percentage maximum drawdown (MaxDD%) for portfolio is the measure of the decline of portfolio net asset value (NAV) from “peak to trough” in the time series from time 0 to time T.
The percentage maximum drawdown as measured from the peak is defined as:48 $MaxDD_{\pi}% = Max_{(0 \leqslant t \leqslant T)} {[Drawdown]_{\pi}%(t)}$
The drawdown% at any time t $(0 \leqslant t \leqslant T)$ is:
$Drawdown_{\pi}%(t) = {Drawdown_{\pi}(t) \over NAV_{\pi,(0 \leqslant \tau \leqslant t)}^{peak} }$ $Drawdown_{\pi}(t) = NAV_{\pi,(0 \leqslant \tau \leqslant t)}^{peak} - NAV_{\pi,t}$
where $NAV_{\pi,t} = w^TNAV_t = [w_1 ... w_n] \begin{bmatrix}
 NAV_{1,t} \\
 \vdots\\
 NAV_{n,t}
 \end{bmatrix}$
Black-Litterman Specifications
The Black-Litterman model offers significant insights to solving the problem of asset allocations 49:

It provides an intuitive reference point (prior) for estimating returns.
It allows and provides a clear way for investor to blend their views together with current market information. This process estimates expected return (which is difficult to estimate, and is an input to Markowitz optimization) and covariances.
The Black-Litterman model leads to more stable and diversified portfolios.

Prior Distribution
Under the Black-Litterman model, returns are normally distributed. The optimal weights of market factors can be obtained via solving the Markowitz mean variance optimization 50.
$max U =w_{mkt}^T {\Pi} - ({\lambda \over 2})w_{mkt}^T \Sigma w_{mkt}$

$U$: Investors quadratic utility functions.
$w_{mkt}$: Vector of market capitalization weights.
$\Pi$: Vector of implied equilibrium excess returns for each factor.
$\lambda$: Risk aversion coefficient.
$\Sigma$: Covariance matrix of the excess return for the factor.

Assumptions
Market Factors and Views

There are $N$ market Factors and $K$ investor's views of these market factors.


Risk free rate, $r_f$ is assumed to be constants.

Assets in Portfolio

There are $M$ assets in the portfolio.

Assuming that the asset's return is a linear function of risk factors return, the $i^{th}$ asset's return, $r_i$ can be expressed as a multiple linear regression model as follow:
$r_i = \Beta_{i,0} + \Beta_{i,1} X_1 +...+ \Beta_{i,N} X_N + \epsilon_i$
where
$r_i$$$i^{th}$$ asset's return, i=1, ..., M.
$\Beta_{i,j}$: Regrssion coefficient of $i^{th}$ asset with respect to $j^{th}$ market factor. i=1, ..., M, j=1, ..., N.
$X_j$$$j^{th}$$ market factor's return, j=1, ..., N.
$\epsilon_i$: Error term associated with the linear regression for $i^{th}$ asset's return, i=1, ..., M. It is assumed that the error term has zero mean.

The portfolio's return, $r_p$ can then be computed as $r_p$≈$\Sigma_i w_i r_i$,

$w_i$: Weight of $i^{th}$ asset in the portfolio.
Main Problem
Given:

Prior: Past and present information - Market equilibrium vector of expected return,
Subjective views of an investor regarding the expected return of one or more market factors,

What will be the impact of the new combined view of the investor on his/her portfolio?
Solving the above problem requires two main stesp:

Using Black-Litterman model to obtain the new combined estimate of the expected return of market factors.
After which, substitute the expected return of market factors into the regression line for each asset, and sum them all up.

For example, the user can see how their portfolio will be influenced when US Economic Recovery and Oil Prices Tank scenarios occur at the same time, with 20% and 10% confidence respectively.
Reporting
The cloud-base technology allows HedgeSPA platform to process huge amount of data efficiently. The platform combines multiple functions and ensure the speed of execution. Users can complete many calculation with one click in the automated online system, instead of doing it by hand in excel file or other traditional softwares.
The Asset Research Notes product analytics tool is a part of the HedgeSPA Research Management Suite, integrated with both the product analytics space and the Library feature. This tool lets managers and researchers append documents and notes to investment products for future reference. Documents attached to notes can be opened or saved directly from the Asset Research Notes screen. 51
The Data Partners tab lets the user know which third party sources have enabled content for the selected investment product. These providers may include market data providers, specialist database providers, news providers, sentiment providers and more. 52
The 'Export' button allows the user to download the contents of their Portfolio Grid directly to a CSV file for integration with other investment management tools. Simply click on the Export button, and your browser will save a CSV file with the contents of all available data Fields in the Portfolio Grid (excepting dynamically populated Scenario Analysis contents). This function may take a moment, as it generates all of the statistics on demand to provide the most up to date analytical information. 53
