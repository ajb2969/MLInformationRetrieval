   CDP-glycerol diphosphatase      CDP-glycerol diphosphatase   In enzymology , a CDP-glycerol diphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CDP-glycerol + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CMP + sn-glycerol 3-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CDP-glycerol and H 2 O , whereas its two products are CMP and sn-glycerol 3-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CDP-glycerol phosphoglycerohydrolase . Other names in common use include CDP-glycerol pyrophosphatase , and cytidine diphosphoglycerol pyrophosphatase . This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 3.6.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
