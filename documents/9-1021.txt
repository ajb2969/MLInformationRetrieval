Eta Draconis

Eta Draconis (η Dra, η Draconis) is a star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Draco. Despite having an apparent visual magnitude of only +2.73,1 it is the second brightest star in this generally faint constellation. Based upon parallax measurements collected during the Hipparcos mission, this star is located at a distance of about  from Earth.2
Eta Draconis is a large star with 2.553 times the mass of the Sun. The spectrum matches a stellar classification of G8 III,4 with the luminosity class III indicating this is an evolved giant star that has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core. It reached this stage in only 5505 million years because higher mass stars such as this consume the supply of hydrogen more rapidly than the Sun. The measured angular diameter of this star, after correction for limb darkening, is .6 At the estimated distance of Eta Draconis,7 this yields a physical size of about 11 times the radius of the Sun.8 From its extended envelope, it is radiating around 60 times the luminosity of the Sun at an effective temperature of 5,055 K,9 giving it the yellow glow of a G-type star.10
A nearby stellar companion is located at an angular separation of 5.1 arcseconds from Eta Draconis. This is an 8.8 magnitude K-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of K2 V.11 At the estimated distance of this star system, the two stars are separated by a physical distance of at least 140 AU and require at least a millennium to complete an orbit.12
Name
η Draconis, together with ζ Dra (Al Dhibah), were Al Dhīʼbain, the Duo Lupi in Arabic, the Two Hyaenas or Wolves, lying in wait for the Camel's Foal, the little star Al Rubaʽ, protected by the Mother Camels.13
In Chinese,  (), meaning Left Wall of Purple Forbidden Enclosure, refers to an asterism consisting of η Draconis, ι Draconis, θ Draconis, ζ Draconis, υ Draconis, 73 Draconis, γ Cephei and 23 Cassiopeiae.14 Consequently, η Draconis itself is known as  (, .),15 representing  (), meaning The Second Premier.16 Possibly, 右樞 (Shǎozǎi) is westernized into Hea Tsae by R.H. Allen with meaning "the Lowest Steward" but it was for θ Dra17
