   Dudley triangle      Dudley triangle    Dudley Triangle may also refer to a neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts .    In mathematics, the Dudley triangle is a triangular array of integers that was defined by . It consists of the numbers                       2                              2       2                        2       1       2                  2       0       0       2            2       6       5       6       2                     ⋮                    absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  2  absent  absent  absent  absent    absent  absent  absent  absent  2  absent  2  absent  absent  absent    absent  absent  absent  2  absent  1  absent  2  absent  absent    absent  absent  2  absent  0  absent  0  absent  2  absent    absent  2  absent  6  absent  5  absent  6  absent  2    absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  normal-⋮  absent  absent  absent  absent     \begin{matrix}&&&&&2&&&&\\

 \end{matrix}   .  Dudley exhibited several rows of this triangle, and challenged readers to find the next row; the challenge was met by J. G. Mauldon, who proposed two different solutions. In one of Mauldon's solutions, the number at the intersection of the m th and n th diagonals (counting the top of the triangle as having m = n = 1) is given by the formula       a   (  n  ,  m  )    =      m  2   +   m  n   +   n  2    -  1   mod   n  +  m  +   1           a   n  m     modulo       superscript  m  2     m  n    superscript  n  2    1     n  m  1      a(n,m)=m^{2}+mn+n^{2}-1\mod n+m+1\,     Notes  References       "  Category:Triangles of numbers
