   On-base plus slugging plus runs batted in      On-base plus slugging plus runs batted in    On-base plus slugging plus runs batted in (OPSBI) is a baseball statistic calculated as the normalized sum of a player's on-base percentage and slugging percentage added to their runs batted in . Former Major League Baseball general manager, Jim Bowden , created this statistic. 1 Hall of Fame outfielder, Babe Ruth , holds both the single-season and career OPSBI records.  Formula  The basic formula is       O  P  S  B  I   =    (    (    O  B  P   +   S  L  G    )   *  1000   )   +   R  B   I           O  P  S  B  I           O  B  P     S  L  G    1000     R  B  I      OPSBI=((OBP+SLG)*1000)+RBI\,     where OBP is on-base percentage and SLG is slugging average. These averages are defined as:       O  B  P   =    H  +   B  B   +   H  B  P      A  B   +   B  B   +   S  F   +   H  B  P           O  B  P       H    B  B     H  B  P        A  B     B  B     S  F     H  B  P       OBP=\frac{H+BB+HBP}{AB+BB+SF+HBP}     and       S  L  G   =    T  B    A  B          S  L  G       T  B     A  B      SLG=\frac{TB}{AB}     where:   H = Hits  BB = Base on balls  HBP = Times hit by pitch  AB = At bats  SF = Sacrifice flies  TB = Total bases   Rewriting the expression to account for the different denominators yields the final expression for OPSBI:       O  P  S  B  I   =        A  B   *   (   H  +   B  B   +   H  B  P    )    +    T  B   *   (    A  B   +   B  B   +   S  F   +   H  B  P    )       A  B   *   (    A  B   +   B  B   +   S  F   +   H  B  P    )     *  1000   +   R  B  I          O  P  S  B  I               A  B     H    B  B     H  B  P         T  B       A  B     B  B     S  F     H  B  P          A  B       A  B     B  B     S  F     H  B  P      1000     R  B  I      OPSBI=\frac{AB*(H+BB+HBP)+TB*(AB+BB+SF+HBP)}{AB*(AB+BB+SF+HBP)}*1000+RBI     Leaders  The Top 10 single-season OPSBI performances in Major League Baseball history:      Rank   Year   Player   OPSBI       1st   1921   Babe Ruth   1529     2nd   2004   Barry Bonds   1522     3rd   1920   Babe Ruth   1519     4th   2001   Barry Bonds   1515     5th   2002   Barry Bonds   1491     6th   1923   Babe Ruth   1440     7th   1927   Babe Ruth   1422     8th   1927   Lou Gehrig   1414     9th   1941   Ted Williams   1408     10th   1926   Babe Ruth   1403     The Top 10 MLB players in lifetime OPSBI through the 2013 season are (active players in bold):      Rank   Player   OPSBI       1st   Babe Ruth   3381     2nd   Hank Aaron   3226     3rd   Lou Gehrig   3074     4th   Barry Bonds   3047     5th   Jimmie Foxx   2959     6th   Ted Williams   2955     7th   Stan Musial   2927     8th   Cap Anson   2914     9th   Alex Rodriguez   2911     10th   Ty Cobb   2882     See also   On-base percentage  Slugging percentage  Runs batted in  Sabermetrics   References  "  Category:Batting statistics     â†©
