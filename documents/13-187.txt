   RV coefficient      RV coefficient   In statistics, the RV coefficient 1 is a multivariate generalization of the squared  Pearson correlation coefficient (because the RV coefficient takes values between 0 and 1). 2 It measures the closeness of two set of points that may each be represented in a matrix .  The major approaches within statistical multivariate data analysis can all be brought into a common framework in which the RV coefficient is maximised subject to relevant constraints. Specifically, these statistical methodologies include: 3  :* principal component analysis  :* canonical correlation analysis  :*multivariate regression  :* statistical classification ( linear discrimination ).  One application of the RV coefficient is in functional neuroimaging where it can measure the similarity between two subjects' series of brain scans 4 or between different scans of a same subject. 5  Definitions  The definition of the RV-coefficient makes use of ideas 6 concerning the definition of scalar-valued quantities which are called the "variance" and "covariance" of vector-valued random variables . Note that standard usage is to have matrices for the variances and covariances of vector random variables. Given these innovative definitions, the RV-coefficient is then just the correlation coefficient defined in the usual way.  Suppose that X and Y are matrices of centered random vectors (column vectors) with covariance matrix given by        Σ   X  Y    =   E   (    X  T   Y   )     ,       subscript  normal-Σ    X  Y      E     superscript  X  T   Y      \Sigma_{XY}=E(X^{T}Y)\,,   then the scalar-valued covariance (denoted by COVV) is defined by 7        COVV   (  X  ,  Y  )    =   T  r   (    Σ   X  Y     Σ   Y  X     )     .        COVV   X  Y      T  r     subscript  normal-Σ    X  Y     subscript  normal-Σ    Y  X        \mathrm{COVV}(X,Y)=Tr(\Sigma_{XY}\Sigma_{YX})\,.   The scalar-valued variance is defined correspondingly:        VAV   (  X  )    =   T  r   (   Σ   X  X   2   )     .        VAV  X     T  r   superscript   subscript  normal-Σ    X  X    2      \mathrm{VAV}(X)=Tr(\Sigma_{XX}^{2})\,.   With these definitions, the variance and covariance have certain additive properties in relation to the formation of new vector quantities by extending an existing vector with the elements of another. 8  Then the RV-coefficient is defined by 9        RV   (  X  ,  Y  )    =     COVV   (  X  ,  Y  )      VAV   (  X  )   VAV   (  Y  )        .        RV   X  Y        COVV   X  Y        VAV  X  VAV  Y       \mathrm{RV}(X,Y)=\frac{\mathrm{COVV}(X,Y)}{\sqrt{\mathrm{VAV}(X)\mathrm{VAV}(Y%
