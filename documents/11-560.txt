   Sterol esterase      Sterol esterase   In enzymology , a sterol esterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   steryl ester + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   sterol + fatty acid   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are steryl ester and H 2 O , whereas its two products are sterol and fatty acid .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is steryl-ester acylhydrolase . Other names in common use include cholesterol esterase , cholesteryl ester synthase , triterpenol esterase , cholesteryl esterase , cholesteryl ester hydrolase , sterol ester hydrolase , cholesterol ester hydrolase , cholesterase , and acylcholesterol lipase . This enzyme participates in bile acid biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
