   Dmitrii Ivanovich Zhuravskii      Dmitrii Ivanovich Zhuravskii   Dmitrii Ivanovich Zhuravskii (1821-1891) 1 2 3 was a Russian engineer who was one of the pioneers of bridge construction and structural mechanics in Russia.  Zhuravskii attended the Nezhin  lycée 4 and entered the St. Petersburg Institute of the Corps of Railroad Engineers where he was influenced by the academician Mikhail Ostrogradsky . He graduated from the institute being first in his class in 1842. 5  In the beginning of his career he took part in the surveying and planning of the Moscow – Saint Petersburg Railway . 6 In 1857-58 he led the reconstruction of the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg . 7 In 1871–76 he took part in the reconstruction of the Mariinsky Canal System 8  He was awarded the prestigious Demidov Prize in 1855 by the Russian Academy of Sciences .  The Zhuravskii Shear Stress formula is named after him (derived it in 1855): 9       τ  =    V  Q    I  t     ,      τ      V  Q     I  t      \tau={VQ\over It},    10 where   V = total shear force at the location in question;  Q = statical moment of area ;  t = thickness in the material perpendicular to the shear;  I = Moment of Inertia of the entire cross sectional area.
