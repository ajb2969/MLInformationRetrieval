Ultraconnected space

In mathematics, a topological space

 
  is said to be ultraconnected if no pair of nonempty closed sets of 
 
 
 
  is disjoint. Equivalently, a space is ultraconnected if and only if the closures of two distinct points always have non trivial intersection. Hence, no 
 
 
 
  space with more than 1 point is ultraconnected.1
All ultraconnected spaces are path-connected (but not necessarily arc connected2), normal, limit point compact, and pseudocompact.
