   Ultraconnected space      Ultraconnected space   In mathematics , a topological space    X   X   X   is said to be ultraconnected if no pair of nonempty closed sets of   X   X   X   is disjoint . Equivalently, a space is ultraconnected if and only if the closures of two distinct points always have non trivial intersection. Hence, no    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   space with more than 1 point is ultraconnected. 1  All ultraconnected spaces are path-connected (but not necessarily arc connected 2 ), normal , limit point compact , and pseudocompact .
