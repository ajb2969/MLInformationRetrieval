   Rost invariant      Rost invariant   In mathematics, the Rost invariant is a cohomological invariant of an absolutely simple simply connected algebraic group  G over a field k , which associates an element of the Galois cohomology group H 3 ( k , Q / Z (2)) to a principal homogeneous space for G . Here the coefficient group Q / Z (2) is the tensor product of the group of roots of unity of an algebraic closure of k with itself.  first introduced the invariant for groups of type F 4 and later extended it to more general groups in unpublished work that was summarized by .  The Rost invariant is a generalization of the Arason invariant .  Definition  Suppose that G is an absolutely almost simple simply connected algebraic group over a field k . The Rost invariant associates an element a ( P ) of the Galois cohomology group H 3 ( k , Q / Z (2)) to a G -torsor P .  The element a ( P ) is constructed as follows. For any extension K of k there is an exact sequence      0  →    H  3    (  K  ,    𝐐  /  𝐙    (  2  )    )    →    H   e  t   3    (   P  K   ,    𝐐  /  𝐙    (  2  )    )    →   𝐐  /  𝐙        normal-→  0     superscript  H  3    K      𝐐  𝐙   2       normal-→       subscript   superscript  H  3     e  t      subscript  P  K       𝐐  𝐙   2       normal-→      𝐐  𝐙      0\rightarrow H^{3}(K,\mathbf{Q}/\mathbf{Z}(2))\rightarrow H^{3}_{et}(P_{K},%
 \mathbf{Q}/\mathbf{Z}(2))\rightarrow\mathbf{Q}/\mathbf{Z}   where the middle group is the étale cohomology group and Q / Z is the geometric part of the cohomology. Choose a finite extension K of k such that G splits over K and P has a rational point over K . Then the exact sequence splits canonically as a direct sum so the étale cohomology group contains Q / Z canonically. The invariant a ( P ) is the image of the element 1/[ K : k ] of Q / Z under the trace map from H( P K , Q / Z (2)) to H( P , Q / Z (2)), which lies in the subgroup H 3 ( k , Q / Z (2)).  These invariants a ( P ) are functorial in field extensions K of k ; in other words the fit together to form an element of the cyclic group Inv 3 ( G , Q / Z (2)) of cohomological invariants of the group G , which consists of morphisms of the functor K →H 1 ( K , G ) to the functor K →H 3 ( K , Q / Z (2)). This element of Inv 3 ( G , Q / Z (2)) is a generator of the group and is called the Rost invariant of G .  References        "  Category:Algebraic groups
