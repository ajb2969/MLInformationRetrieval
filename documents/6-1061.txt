   11-Beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase      11-Beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase   11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD-11β or 11β-HSD) is the name of a family of enzymes that catalyze the conversion of inert 11 keto-products ( cortisone ) to active cortisol , or vice versa, 1 thus regulating the access of glucocorticoids to the steroid receptors:   11β-hydroxysteroid + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   an 11-oxosteroid + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 11beta-hydroxysteroid and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 11-oxosteroid , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 11beta-hydroxysteroid:NADP + 11-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include corticosteroid 11β-dehydrogenase , β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase , 11β-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase , corticosteroid 11-reductase , and dehydrogenase, 11β-hydroxy steroid . This enzyme participates in c21- steroid hormone metabolism and androgen and estrogen metabolism.  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 8 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , and .  Function    Cortisol , a glucocorticoid, binds the glucocorticoid receptor. However, because of its molecular similarity to aldosterone it is also capable of binding the mineralcorticoid receptor. Both aldosterone and cortisol have a similar affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor; however, there is vastly more cortisol in circulation than aldosterone. To prevent over-stimulation of the mineralocorticoid receptor by cortisol, HSD-11β converts the biologically active cortisol to the inactive cortisone, which can no longer bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor. 11β-HSD co-localizes with intracellular adrenal steroid receptors. Licorice or Carbenoxolone , which contains glycyrrhetinic acid , can inhibit 11β-HSD and lead to a mineralocorticoid excess syndrome . {{-}}  Isoforms  In humans, there are two HSD11B isoforms: 2 3      HSD11B1   NADPH -dependent   Highly expressed in key metabolic tissues including liver , adipose tissue , and the central nervous system .   In these tissues, HSD11B1 reduces cortisone to the active hormone cortisol that activates glucocorticoid receptors .     HSD11B2   NAD + -dependent   Expressed in aldosterone -selective tissues, including kidneys, liver, lungs, colon, salivary glands, HSD2 neurons and placenta.   In these tissues, HSD11B2 oxidizes cortisol to cortisone and prevents illicit activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor .     Inhibition of HSD11B1 has been suggested as a possible therapy for treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome . 4  See also   11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1  Corticosteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenase isozyme 2   References        External links     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of known structure     ↩  ↩  ↩
