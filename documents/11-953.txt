   N6-hydroxylysine O-acetyltransferase      N6-hydroxylysine O-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a N6-hydroxylysine O-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + N 6 -hydroxy-L-lysine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + N 6 -acetyl-N 6 -hydroxy-L-lysine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and N6-hydroxy-L-lysine , whereas its two products are CoA and N6-acetyl-N6-hydroxy-L-lysine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:N6-hydroxy-L-lysine 6-acetyltransferase . Other names in common use include N6-hydroxylysine:acetyl CoA N6-transacetylase , N6-hydroxylysine acetylase , and acetyl-CoA:6-N-hydroxy-L-lysine 6-acetyltransferase . This enzyme participates in lysine degradation .  References      "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
