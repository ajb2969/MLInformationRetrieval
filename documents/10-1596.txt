2-aminohexano-6-lactam racemase

In enzymology, a 2-aminohexano-6-lactam racemase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-2-aminohexano-6-lactam 
 
 
 
  D-2-aminohexano-6-lactam
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-2-aminohexano-6-lactam, and one product, D-2-aminohexano-6-lactam.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on amino acids and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-aminohexano-6-lactam racemase. This enzyme is also called alpha-amino-epsilon-caprolactam racemase.
