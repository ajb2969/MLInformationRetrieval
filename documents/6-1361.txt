   Alexander's trick      Alexander's trick   Alexander's trick , also known as the Alexander trick , is a basic result in geometric topology , named after J. W. Alexander .  Statement  Two homeomorphisms of the n - dimensional  ball     D  n     superscript  D  n    D^{n}   which agree on the boundary  sphere     S   n  -  1      superscript  S    n  1     S^{n-1}   are isotopic .  More generally, two homeomorphisms of D n that are isotopic on the boundary are isotopic.  Proof  Base case : every homeomorphism which fixes the boundary is isotopic to the identity relative to the boundary.  If    f  :    D  n   →   D  n       normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  D  n    superscript  D  n      f\colon D^{n}\to D^{n}   satisfies     f   (  x  )    =   x  for all  x   ∈   S   n  -  1            f  x     x  for all  x         superscript  S    n  1       f(x)=x\mbox{ for all }x\in S^{n-1}   , then an isotopy connecting f to the identity is given by       J   (  x  ,  t  )    =   {       t  f   (   x  /  t   )    ,        if  0   ≤   ∥  x  ∥   <  t   ,        x  ,       if  t   ≤   ∥  x  ∥   ≤  1.             J   x  t     cases    t  f    x  t          if  0    norm  x        t    x        if  t    norm  x        1.       J(x,t)=\begin{cases}tf(x/t),&\mbox{if }0\leq\|x\|     Visually, the homeomorphism is 'straightened out' from the boundary, 'squeezing'   f   f   f   down to the origin. William Thurston calls this "combing all the tangles to one point".  The subtlety is that at    t  =  0      t  0    t=0   ,   f   f   f   "disappears": the germ at the origin "jumps" from an infinitely stretched version of   f   f   f   to the identity. Each of the steps in the homotopy could be smoothed (smooth the transition), but the homotopy (the overall map) has a singularity at     (  x  ,  t  )   =   (  0  ,  0  )        x  t    0  0     (x,t)=(0,0)   . This underlines that the Alexander trick is a PL construction, but not smooth.  General case : isotopic on boundary implies isotopic  If     f  ,  g   :    D  n   →   D  n       normal-:   f  g    normal-→   superscript  D  n    superscript  D  n      f,g\colon D^{n}\to D^{n}   are two homeomorphisms that agree on    S   n  -  1      superscript  S    n  1     S^{n-1}   , then     g   -  1    f       superscript  g    1    f    g^{-1}f   is the identity on    S   n  -  1      superscript  S    n  1     S^{n-1}   , so we have an isotopy   J   J   J   from the identity to     g   -  1    f       superscript  g    1    f    g^{-1}f   . The map    g  J      g  J    gJ   is then an isotopy from   g   g   g   to   f   f   f   .  Radial extension  Some authors use the term Alexander trick for the statement that every homeomorphism of    S   n  -  1      superscript  S    n  1     S^{n-1}   can be extended to a homeomorphism of the entire ball    D  n     superscript  D  n    D^{n}   .  However, this is much easier to prove than the result discussed above: it is called radial extension (or coning) and is also true piecewise-linearly , but not smoothly.  Concretely, let    f  :    S   n  -  1    →   S   n  -  1        normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  S    n  1     superscript  S    n  1       f\colon S^{n-1}\to S^{n-1}   be a homeomorphism, then      F  :    D  n   →    D  n   with  F   (   r  x   )    =   r  f   (  x  )   for all  r   ∈    [  0  ,  1  ]   and  x   ∈   S   n  -  1        normal-:  F     normal-→   superscript  D  n      superscript  D  n   with  F    r  x           r  f  x  for all  r           0  1   and  x         superscript  S    n  1        F\colon D^{n}\to D^{n}\mbox{ with }F(rx)=rf(x)\mbox{ for all }r\in[0,1]\mbox{ %
 and }x\in S^{n-1}   defines a homeomorphism of the ball.  Exotic spheres  The failure of smooth radial extension and the success of PL radial extension yield exotic spheres via twisted spheres .  References     "  Category:Geometric topology  Category:Homeomorphisms
