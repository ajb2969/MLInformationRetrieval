   Arogenate dehydrogenase      Arogenate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , an arogenate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-arogenate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-tyrosine + NADH + CO 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-arogenate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are L-tyrosine , NADH , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-arogenate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) . Other names in common use include arogenic dehydrogenase (ambiguous) , cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase , pretyrosine dehydrogenase (ambiguous) , and L-arogenate:NAD+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis and novobiocin biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
