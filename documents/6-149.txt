   Cluster decay      Cluster decay   Cluster decay , also named heavy particle radioactivity or heavy ion radioactivity , is a type of nuclear decay in which an atomic nucleus emits a small "cluster" of neutrons and protons , more than in an alpha particle , but less than a typical binary fission fragment . Ternary fission into three fragments also produces products in the cluster size. The loss of protons from the parent nucleus changes it to the nucleus of a different element, the daughter, with a mass number A d = A - A e and atomic number Z d = Z - Z e where A e = N e + Z e . 1 For example:    →  +    This type of rare decay mode was observed in radioisotopes that decay predominantly by alpha emission , and it occurs only in a small percentage of the decays for all such isotopes. {{ cite book  | last = Poenaru  | first = D. N.  |author2=Greiner W.  | title = Nuclear Decay Modes  | publisher = Institute of Physics Publishing, Bristol  | year = 1996, Eds.  | pages = 1–577  | isbn = 0-7503-0338-7 }}  The branching ratio with respect to alpha decay      B  =    T  a   /   T  c        B     subscript  T  a    subscript  T  c      B=T_{a}/T_{c}     is rather small (see the Table below). T a and T c are the half-lives of the parent nucleus relative to alpha decay and cluster radioactivity, respectively.  Cluster decay, like alpha decay, is a quantum tunneling process: in order to be emitted, the cluster must penetrate a potential barrier. This is a different process than the more random nuclear disintegration that precedes light fragment emission in ternary fission , which may be a result of a nuclear reaction , but can also be a type of spontaneous radioactive decay in certain nuclides, demonstrating that input energy is not necessarily needed for fission, which remains a fundamentally different process mechanistically.  Theoretically any nucleus with Z > 40 for which the released energy (Q value) is a positive quantity, can be a cluster-emitter. In practice, observations are severely restricted to limitations imposed by currently available experimental techniques which require a sufficiently short half-life, T c 32 s, and a sufficiently large branching ratio B > 10 −17 .  In the absence of any energy loss for fragment deformation and excitation, as in cold fission phenomena or in alpha decay, the total kinetic energy is equal to the Q-value and is divided between the particles in inverse proportion with their masses, as required by conservation of linear momentum       E  k   =    Q   A  d    /  A        subscript  E  k       Q   subscript  A  d    A     E_{k}=QA_{d}/A     where A d is the mass number of the daughter, A d = A – A e .  Cluster decay exists in an intermediate position between alpha decay (in which a nucleus spits out a He 4 nucleus), and spontaneous fission , in which a heavy nucleus splits into two (or more) large fragments and an assorted number of neutrons. Spontaneous fission ends up with a probabilistic distribution of daughter products, which sets it apart from cluster decay. In cluster decay for a given radioisotope, the emitted particle is a light nucleus and the decay method always emits this same particle. For heavier emitted clusters there is otherwise practically no qualitative difference between cluster decay and spontaneous cold fission.  History  The first information about the atomic nucleus was obtained at the beginning of the 20th century by studying radioactivity. For a long period of time only three kinds of nuclear decay modes ( alpha , beta , and gamma ) were known. They illustrate three of the fundamental interactions in nature: strong , weak , and electromagnetic . Spontaneous fission became popular soon after its discovery in 1940 by K. Petrzhak and G. Flerov owing to both military and peaceful applications of neutron-induced fission discovered in 1939 by Otto Hahn , Lise Meitner , and Fritz Strassmann , employing the large amount of energy released during the process.  There are many other kinds of radioactivity, e.g. cluster decay, proton decay , various beta-delayed decay modes (p, 2p, 3p, n, 2n, 3n, 4n, d, t, alpha, f), fission isomers , particle accompanied (ternary) fission, etc. The height of the potential barrier, mainly of Coulomb nature, for emission of the charged particles is much higher than the observed kinetic energy of the emitted particles. The spontaneous decay can only be explained by quantum tunneling in a similar way to the first application of the Quantum Mechanics to Nuclei given by G. Gamow for alpha decay.   "In 1980 A. Sandulescu, D.N. Poenaru, and W. Greiner described calculations indicating the possibility of a new type of decay of heavy nuclei intermediate between alpha decay and spontaneous fission. The first observation of heavy-ion radioactivity was that of a 30-MeV, carbon-14 emission from radium-223 by H.J. Rose and G.A. Jones in 1984" .   2  Usually the theory explains an already experimentally observed phenomenon. Cluster decay is one of the rare examples of phenomena predicted before experimental discovery. Theoretical predictions were made in 1980, 3 four years before experimental discovery. 4  Four theoretical approaches were used: fragmentation theory by solving a Schrödinger equation with mass asymmetry as a variable to obtain the mass distributions of fragments; penetrability calculations similar to those used in traditional theory of alpha decay, and superasymmetric fission models, numerical (NuSAF) and analytical (ASAF). Superasymmetric fission models are based on the macroscopic-microscopic approach 5 using the asymmetrical two-center shell model 6 7 level energies as input data for the shell and pairing corrections. Either the liquid drop model 8 or the Yukawa-plus-exponential model 9 extended to different charge-to-mass ratios 10 have been used to calculate the macroscopic deformation energy.  Penetrability theory predicted eight decay modes: 14 C, 24 Ne, 28 Mg, 32,34 Si, 46 Ar, and 48,50 Ca from the following parent nuclei: 222,224 Ra, 230,232 Th, 236,238 U, 244,246 Pu, 248,250 Cm, 250,252 Cf, 252,254 Fm, and 252,254 No.  The first experimental report was published in 1984, when physicists at Oxford University discovered that 223 Ra emits one 14 C nucleus out of every billion (10 9 ) alpha decays.  Theory  The quantum tunneling may be calculated either by extending fission theory to a larger mass asymmetry or by heavier emitted particle from alpha decay theory. 11  Both fission-like and alpha-like approaches are able to express the decay constant   λ   λ   \lambda   = ln 2 / T c , as a product of three model-dependent quantities        λ  =   ν  S   P  s        λ    ν  S   subscript  P  s      \lambda=\nu SP_{s}        where   ν   ν   \nu   is the frequency of assaults on the barrier per second, S is the preformation probability of the cluster at the nuclear surface, and P s is the penetrability of the external barrier. In alpha-like theories S is an overlap integral of the wave function of the three partners (parent, daughter, and emitted cluster). In a fission theory the preformation probability is the penetrability of the internal part of the barrier from the initial turning point R i to the touching point R t . 12 Very frequently it is calculated by using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation.  A very large number, of the order 10 5 , of parent-emitted cluster combinations were considered in a systematic search for new decay modes . The large amount of computations could be performed in a reasonable time by using the ASAF model developed by Dorin N Poenaru , Walter Greiner , et al. The model was the first to be used to predict measurable quantities in cluster decay. More than 150 cluster decay modes have been predicted before any other kind of half-lives calculations have been reported. Comprehensive tables of half-lives , branching ratios , and kinetic energies have been published, e.g. 13 . 14 Potential barrier shapes similar to that considered within the ASAF model have been calculated by using the macroscopic-microscopic method. 15  Previously 16 it was shown that even alpha decay may be considered a particular case of cold fission . The ASAF model may be used to describe in a unified manner cold alpha decay, cluster decay, and cold fission (see figure 6.7, p. 287 of the Ref. [2]).  One can obtain with good approximation one universal curve (UNIV) for any kind of cluster decay mode with a mass number Ae, including alpha decay         log  T   =     -   log   P  s     -  22.169   +   0.598   (    A  e   -  1   )           T            subscript  P  s     22.169     0.598     subscript  A  e   1       \log T=-\log P_{s}-22.169+0.598(A_{e}-1)        In a logarithmic scale the equation log T = f(log P s ) represents a single straight line which can be conveniently used to estimate the half-life. A single universal curve for alpha decay and cluster decay modes results by expressing log T + log S = f(log P s ). 17 The experimental data on cluster decay in three groups of even-even, even-odd, and odd-even parent nuclei are reproduced with comparable accuracy by both types of universal curves, fission-like UNIV and UDL 18 derived using alpha-like R-matrix theory.  In order to find the released energy        Q  =    [   M  -   (    M  d   +   M  e    )    ]    c  2        Q     delimited-[]    M     subscript  M  d    subscript  M  e       superscript  c  2      Q=[M-(M_{d}+M_{e})]c^{2}        one can use the compilation of measured masses 19 M, M d , and M e of the parent, daughter, and emitted nuclei, c is the light velocity. The mass excess is transformed into energy according to the Einstein's formula E = mc 2 .  Experiments  The main experimental difficulty in observing cluster decay comes from the need to identify a few rare events among an enormous number of background alpha particle. The quantities experimentally determined are the partial half life, T c , and the kinetic energy of the emitted cluster E k . There is also a need to identify the emitted particle.  Detection of radiations is based on their interactions with matter, leading mainly to ionizations. Using a semiconductor telescope and conventional electronics to identify the 14 C ions, the Rose and Jones's experiment was running for about six months in order to get 11 useful events.  With modern magnetic spectrometers (SOLENO and Enge-split pole), at Orsay and Argonne National Laboratory (see ch. 7 in Ref. [2] pp. 188–204), a very strong source could be used, so that results were obtained in a run of few hours.  Solid state nuclear track detectors (SSNTD) insensitive to alpha particles and magnetic spectrometers in which alpha particles are deflected by a strong magnetic field have been used to overcome this difficulty. SSNTD are cheap and handy but they need chemical etching and microscope scanning.  A key role in experiments on cluster decay modes performed in Berkeley, Orsay, Dubna, and Milano played P. Buford Price, Eid Hourany, Michel Hussonnois, Svetlana Tretyakova, A. A. Ogloblin, Roberto Bonetti, and their coworkers.  The main region of 20 emitters experimentally observed until 2010 is above Z=86: 221 Fr, 221-224,226 Ra, 223,225 Ac, 228,230 Th, 231 Pa, 230,232-236 U, 236,238 Pu, and 242 Cm. Only upper limits could be detected in the following cases: 12 C decay of 114 Ba, 15 N decay of 223 Ac, 18 O decay of 226 Th, 24,26 Ne decays of 232 Th and of 236 U, 28 Mg decays of 232,233,235 U, 30 Mg decay of 237 Np, and 34 Si decay of 240 Pu and of 241 Am.  Some of the cluster emitters are members of the three natural radioactive families. Others should be produced by nuclear reactions. Up to now no odd-odd emitter has been observed.  From many decay modes with half-lives and branching ratios relative to alpha decay predicted with the analytical superasymmetric fission (ASAF) model, the following 11 have been experimentally confirmed: 14 C, 20 O, 23 F, 22,24-26 Ne, 28,30 Mg, and 32,34 Si. The experimental data are in good agreement with predicted values. A strong shell effect can be seen: as a rule the shortest value of the half-life is obtained when the daughter nucleus has a magic number of neutrons (N d = 126) and/or protons (Z d = 82).  The known cluster emissions as of 2010 are as follows: 20 21 22      Isotope   Emitted particle   Branching ratio   log T(s)   Q (MeV)       114 Ba   12 C   <   > 4.10   18.985     221 Fr   14 C    14.52   31.290     221 Ra   14 C    13.39   32.394     222 Ra   14 C    11.01   33.049     223 Ra   14 C    15.04   31.829     224 Ra   14 C    15.86   30.535     223 Ac   14 C    12.96   33.064     225 Ac   14 C    17.28   30.476     226 Ra   14 C    21.19   28.196     228 Th   20 O    20.72   44.723     230 Th   24 Ne    24.61   57.758     231 Pa   23 F    26.02   51.844      24 Ne    22.88   60.408     232 U   24 Ne    20.40   62.309      28 Mg   <   > 22.26   74.318     233 U   24 Ne    24.84   60.484      25 Ne     60.776      28 Mg   <   > 27.59   74.224     234 U   28 Mg    25.14   74.108      24 Ne    25.88   58.825      26 Ne     59.465     235 U   24 Ne    27.42   57.361      25 Ne     57.756      28 Mg   <   > 28.09   72.162      29 Mg     72.535     236 U   24 Ne   <   > 25.90   55.944      26 Ne     56.753      28 Mg    27.58   70.560      30 Mg     72.299     236 Pu   28 Mg    21.52   79.668     237 Np   30 Mg   <   > 27.57   74.814     238 Pu   32 Si    25.27   91.188      28 Mg    25.70   75.910      30 Mg     76.822     240 Pu   34 Si   <   > 25.52   91.026     241 Am   34 Si   <   > 25.26   93.923     242 Cm   34 Si    23.15   96.508     Fine structure  The fine structure in 14 C radioactivity of 223 Ra was discussed for the first time by M. Greiner and W. Scheid in 1986. 23 The superconducting spectrometer SOLENO of IPN Orsay has been used since 1984 to identify 14 C clusters emitted from 222-224,226 Ra nuclei. Moreover it was used to discover 24 25 the fine structure observing transitions to excited states of the daughter. A transition with an excited state of 14 C predicted in Ref. [24] was not yet observed.  Surprisingly, the experimentalists had seen a transition to the first excited state of the daughter stronger than that to the ground state. The transition is favoured if the uncoupled nucleon is left in the same state in both parent and daughter nuclei. Otherwise the difference in nuclear structure leads to a large hindrance.  The interpretation 26 was confirmed: the main spherical component of the deformed parent wave function has an i 11/2 character, i.e. the main component is spherical.
