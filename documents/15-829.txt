   DTDP-6-deoxy-L-talose 4-dehydrogenase (NAD+)      DTDP-6-deoxy-L-talose 4-dehydrogenase (NAD+)    DTDP-6-deoxy-L-talose 4-dehydrogenase (NAD + ) (, tll (gene name) ) is an enzyme with system name dTDP-6-deoxy-beta-L-talose:NAD + 4-oxidoreductase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   dTDP-6-deoxy-beta-L-talose + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-beta-L-mannose + NADH + H +    The enzyme from bacterium Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans participates in the biosynthesis of the serotype c-specific polysaccharide antigen.
