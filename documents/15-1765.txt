   Reciprocal distribution      Reciprocal distribution   In probability and statistics , the reciprocal distribution is a continuous probability distribution . It is characterised by its probability density function , within the support of the distribution, being proportional to the reciprocal of the variable.  The reciprocal distribution is an example of an inverse distribution , and the reciprocal (inverse) of a random variable with a reciprocal distribution itself has a reciprocal distribution.  Definition  The probability density function (pdf) of the reciprocal distribution is        f   (  x  ;  a  ,  b  )    =   1   x   [     log  e    (  b  )    -    log  e    (  a  )     ]        for  a   ≤  x  ≤   b  and  a   >  0.      formulae-sequence      f   x  a  b      1    x   delimited-[]      subscript   e   b     subscript   e   a              for  a   x         b  and  a        0.      f(x;a,b)=\frac{1}{x[\log_{e}(b)-\log_{e}(a)]}\quad\text{ for }a\leq x\leq b%
 \text{ and }a>0.     Here,   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   are the parameters of the distribution, which are the lower and upper bounds of the support , and    log  e     subscript   e    \log_{e}   is the natural log function (the logarithm to base e ). The cumulative distribution function is         F   (  x  ;  a  ,  b  )    =      log  e    (  x  )    -    log  e    (  a  )        log  e    (  b  )    -    log  e    (  a  )         for  a   ≤  x  ≤  b    .     formulae-sequence      F   x  a  b          subscript   e   x     subscript   e   a        subscript   e   b     subscript   e   a            for  a   x       b      F(x;a,b)=\frac{\log_{e}(x)-\log_{e}(a)}{\log_{e}(b)-\log_{e}(a)}\quad\text{ %
 for }a\leq x\leq b.     Differential equation  The pdf of the reciprocal distribution is a solution to the following differential equation :      {         x   f  ′    (  x  )    +   f   (  x  )     =  0   ,         f   (  1  )    =   1    log   (  b  )    -   log   (  a  )          }             x   superscript  f  normal-′   x     f  x    0         f  1     1      b     a          \left\{\begin{array}[]{l}xf^{\prime}(x)+f(x)=0,\\
 f(1)=\frac{1}{\log(b)-\log(a)}\end{array}\right\}     Applications  The reciprocal distribution is of considerable importance in numerical analysis as a computer ’s arithmetic operations transform mantissas with initial arbitrary distributions to the reciprocal distribution as a limiting distribution. 1  References  "  Category:Continuous distributions  Category:Probability distributions     Hamming R.
