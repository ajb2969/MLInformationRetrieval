Inhomogeneous Poisson process
In probability theory, an inhomogeneous Poisson process (or non-homogeneous Poisson process) is a Poisson process with rate parameter 
 
 
 
  such that the rate parameter of the process is a function of time.1 Inhomogeneous Poisson processes have been used to describe numerous random phenomena2 including cyclone prediction,3 arrival times of calls to a call centre in a hospital laboratory4 and call centre,5 arrival times of aircraft to airspace around an airport6 and database transaction times.7
The Cox process is an extension of this model where λ(t) itself can be a stochastic or random process.
Definition
Write 
 
 
 
  for the number of events by time 
 
 
 
 . A stochastic process is an inhomogeneous Poisson process for some small value 
 
 
 
  if:89




Non-overlapping increments are independent







for all t and where, in big o notation, 
 
 
 
 . In the case of point processes with refractoriness (e.g., neural spike trains) a stronger version of property 4 holds:10

 
 .
Properties
Write N(t) for the number of events by time t and 
 
 
 
  for the mean. Then N(t) has a Poisson distribution with parameter m(t), that is for k = 0, 1, 2, 3….11



Fitting
Traffic on the AT&T; long distance network was modelled by a inhomogeneous Poisson process with piecewise linear rate function.12 Ordinary least squares, iterative weighted least squares and maximum likelihood methods were evaluated and maximum likelihood shown to perform best overall for the data.
Simulation
An inhomogeneous Poisson process with intensity function λ(t) can be simulated by rejection sampling from a homogeneous Poisson process with fixed rate λ: choose a sufficiently large λ so that λ(t) = λ p(t) and simulate a Poisson process with rate parameter λ. Accept an event from the Poisson simulation at time t with probability p(t).1314 For a log-linear rate function a more efficient method was published by Lewis and Shedler in 1975.15
