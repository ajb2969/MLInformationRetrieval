   Space cardioid      Space cardioid   (Figure)  A space cardioid introduction at Georgia Tech   The space cardioid is a 3-dimensional  curve derived from the cardioid . It has a parametric representation using trigonometric functions .  Definition  The general form of the equation is most easily understood in parametric form, as follows:       X   (  t  )    =   (    (   k  +   cos   (  t  )     )    cos   (  t  )     ,    (   j  +   cos   (  t  )     )    sin   (  t  )     ,   sin   (  t  )    )         X  t        k    t      t        j    t      t      t      X(t)=((k+\cos(t))\cos(t),(j+\cos(t))\sin(t),\sin(t))\,     References  External links   1   "  Category:Trigonometry  Category:Curves
