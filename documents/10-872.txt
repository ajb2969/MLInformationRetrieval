   15-oxoprostaglandin 13-oxidase      15-oxoprostaglandin 13-oxidase   In enzymology , a 15-oxoprostaglandin 13-oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (5Z)-(15S)-11alpha-hydroxy-9,15-dioxoprostanoate + NAD(P)+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (5Z)-(15S)-11alpha-hydroxy-9,15-dioxoprosta-13-enoate + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (5Z)-(15S)-11alpha-hydroxy-9,15-dioxoprostanoate , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are (5Z)-(15S)-11alpha-hydroxy-9,15-dioxoprosta-13-enoate , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (5Z)-(15S)-11alpha-hydroxy-9,15-dioxoprostanoate:NAD(P)+ Delta13-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 15-oxo-Delta13-prostaglandin reductase , Delta13-15-ketoprostaglandin reductase , 15-ketoprostaglandin Delta13-reductase , prostaglandin Delta13-reductase , prostaglandin 13-reductase , and 15-ketoprostaglandin Delta13-reductase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
