   Bipolar cylindrical coordinates      Bipolar cylindrical coordinates   (Figure)  Coordinate surfaces of the bipolar cylindrical coordinates. The yellow crescent corresponds to σ, whereas the red tube corresponds to τ and the blue plane corresponds to z =1. The three surfaces intersect at the point P (shown as a black sphere).   Bipolar cylindrical coordinates are a three-dimensional orthogonal  coordinate system that results from projecting the two-dimensional bipolar coordinate system in the perpendicular   z   z   z   -direction. The two lines of foci     F  1     subscript  F  1    F_{1}   and    F  2     subscript  F  2    F_{2}   of the projected Apollonian circles are generally taken to be defined by    x  =   -  a       x    a     x=-a   and    x  =   +  a       x    a     x=+a   , respectively, (and by    y  =  0      y  0    y=0   ) in the Cartesian coordinate system .  The term "bipolar" is often used to describe other curves having two singular points (foci), such as ellipses , hyperbolas , and Cassini ovals . However, the term bipolar coordinates is never used to describe coordinates associated with those curves, e.g., elliptic coordinates .  Basic definition  The most common definition of bipolar cylindrical coordinates    (  σ  ,  τ  ,  z  )     σ  τ  z    (\sigma,\tau,z)   is      x  =    a     sinh  τ     cosh  τ   -   cos  σ          x    a      τ       τ     σ        x=a\ \frac{\sinh\tau}{\cosh\tau-\cos\sigma}         y  =    a     sin  σ     cosh  τ   -   cos  σ          y    a      σ       τ     σ        y=a\ \frac{\sin\sigma}{\cosh\tau-\cos\sigma}         z  =  z      z  z    z=\ z     where the   σ   σ   \sigma   coordinate of a point   P   P   P   equals the angle     F  1   P   F  2        subscript  F  1   P   subscript  F  2     F_{1}PF_{2}   and the   τ   τ   \tau   coordinate equals the natural logarithm of the ratio of the distances    d  1     subscript  d  1    d_{1}   and    d  2     subscript  d  2    d_{2}   to the focal lines      τ  =   ln    d  1    d  2         τ       subscript  d  1    subscript  d  2       \tau=\ln\frac{d_{1}}{d_{2}}     (Recall that the focal lines    F  1     subscript  F  1    F_{1}   and    F  2     subscript  F  2    F_{2}   are located at    x  =   -  a       x    a     x=-a   and    x  =   +  a       x    a     x=+a   , respectively.)  Surfaces of constant   σ   σ   \sigma   correspond to cylinders of different radii        x  2   +    (   y  -   a   cot  σ     )   2    =    a  2     sin  2   σ           superscript  x  2    superscript    y    a    σ     2       superscript  a  2     superscript   2   σ      x^{2}+\left(y-a\cot\sigma\right)^{2}=\frac{a^{2}}{\sin^{2}\sigma}     that all pass through the focal lines and are not concentric. The surfaces of constant   τ   τ   \tau   are non-intersecting cylinders of different radii        y  2   +    (   x  -   a   coth  τ     )   2    =    a  2     sinh  2   τ           superscript  y  2    superscript    x    a   hyperbolic-cotangent  τ     2       superscript  a  2     superscript   2   τ      y^{2}+\left(x-a\coth\tau\right)^{2}=\frac{a^{2}}{\sinh^{2}\tau}     that surround the focal lines but again are not concentric. The focal lines and all these cylinders are parallel to the   z   z   z   -axis (the direction of projection). In the    z  =  0      z  0    z=0   plane, the centers of the constant-   σ   σ   \sigma   and constant-   τ   τ   \tau   cylinders lie on the   y   y   y   and   x   x   x   axes, respectively.  Scale factors  The scale factors for the bipolar coordinates   σ   σ   \sigma   and   τ   τ   \tau   are equal       h  σ   =   h  τ   =   a    cosh  τ   -   cos  σ            subscript  h  σ    subscript  h  τ          a      τ     σ        h_{\sigma}=h_{\tau}=\frac{a}{\cosh\tau-\cos\sigma}     whereas the remaining scale factor     h  z   =  1       subscript  h  z   1    h_{z}=1   . Thus, the infinitesimal volume element equals       d  V   =     a  2     (    cosh  τ   -   cos  σ    )   2    d  σ  d  τ  d  z         d  V        superscript  a  2    superscript      τ     σ    2    d  σ  d  τ  d  z     dV=\frac{a^{2}}{\left(\cosh\tau-\cos\sigma\right)^{2}}d\sigma d\tau dz     and the Laplacian is given by        ∇  2   Φ   =     1   a  2      (    cosh  τ   -   cos  σ    )   2    (      ∂  2   Φ    ∂   σ  2     +     ∂  2   Φ    ∂   τ  2      )    +     ∂  2   Φ    ∂   z  2            superscript  normal-∇  2   normal-Φ         1   superscript  a  2     superscript      τ     σ    2         superscript   2   normal-Φ      superscript  σ  2         superscript   2   normal-Φ      superscript  τ  2           superscript   2   normal-Φ      superscript  z  2        \nabla^{2}\Phi=\frac{1}{a^{2}}\left(\cosh\tau-\cos\sigma\right)^{2}\left(\frac%
 {\partial^{2}\Phi}{\partial\sigma^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}\Phi}{\partial\tau^{2%
 }}\right)+\frac{\partial^{2}\Phi}{\partial z^{2}}     Other differential operators such as    ∇  ⋅  𝐅     normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐅    \nabla\cdot\mathbf{F}   and    ∇  ×  𝐅      normal-∇  𝐅    \nabla\times\mathbf{F}   can be expressed in the coordinates    (  σ  ,  τ  )     σ  τ    (\sigma,\tau)   by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates .  Applications  The classic applications of bipolar coordinates are in solving partial differential equations , e.g., Laplace's equation or the Helmholtz equation , for which bipolar coordinates allow a separation of variables (in 2D). A typical example would be the electric field surrounding two parallel cylindrical conductors.
