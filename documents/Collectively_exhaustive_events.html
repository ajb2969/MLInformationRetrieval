<h1>Collectively exhaustive events</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a href="probability_theory" title="wikilink">probability theory</a> and <a class="uri" href="logic" title="wikilink">logic</a>, a <a href="Set_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">set</a> of events is <strong>jointly</strong> or <strong>collectively exhaustive</strong> if at least one of the events must occur. For example, when rolling a <a href="dice" title="wikilink">six-sided die</a>, the outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are collectively exhaustive, because they encompass the entire range of possible outcomes.</p>

<p>Another way to describe collectively exhaustive events, is that their union must cover all the events within the entire sample space. For example, events A and B are said to be collectively exhaustive if</p>

</p>

<p>where S is the <a href="sample_space" title="wikilink">sample space</a>...</p>

<p>Compare this to the concept of a set of <a href="mutually_exclusive_events" title="wikilink">mutually exclusive events</a>. In such a set no more than one event can occur at a given time. (In some forms of mutual exclusion only one event can ever occur.) The set of all possible die rolls is both collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive. The outcomes 1 and 6 are mutually exclusive but not collectively exhaustive. The outcomes "even" (2,4 or 6) and "not-6" (1,2,3,4, or 5) are collectively exhaustive but not mutually exclusive. In some forms of mutual exclusion only one event can ever occur, whether collectively exhaustive or not. For example, tossing a particular biscuit for a group of several dogs cannot be repeated, no matter which dog snaps it up.</p>

<p>One example of an event that is both collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive is tossing a coin. The outcome must be either heads or tails, or p (heads or tails) = 1, so the outcomes are collectively exhaustive. When heads occurs, tails can't occur, or p (heads and tails) = 0, so the outcomes are also mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>The term "exhaustive" has been used in the literature since at least 1914. Here are a few examples:</p>

<p>The following appears as a footnote on page 23 of Couturat 1914:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"As Mrs. LADD·FRANKLlN has truly remarked (BALDWIN, Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, article "Laws of Thought"), the principle of contradiction is not sufficient to define contradictories; the principle of excluded middle must be added which equally deserves the name of principle of contradiction. This is why Mrs. LADD-FRANKLIN proposes to call them respectively the principle of exclusion and the <em>principle of exhaustion</em>, inasmuch as, according to the first, two contradictory terms are exclusive (the one of the other); and, according to the second, they are <em>exhaustive (of the universe of discourse)</em>." (italics added for emphasis)
</dd>
</dl>

<p>In <a href="Stephen_Kleene" title="wikilink">Stephen Kleene</a>'s discussion of cardinal numbers in Kleene 1952, he uses "mutually exclusive" together with "exhaustive":</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Hence, for any two cardinals M and N, the three relationships M  N are 'mutually exclusive', i.e. not more than one of them can hold. ¶ It does not appear till an advanced stage of the theory . . . whether they are '' 'exhaustive' '', i.e. whether at least one of the three must hold". (italics added for emphasis, Kleene 1952:11; original has double bars over the symbols M and N).
