   Inclusion map      Inclusion map   In mathematics , if   A   A   A   is a subset of   B   B   B   , then the inclusion map (also inclusion function , insertion , or canonical injection ) 1 is the function    ι   ι   \iota   that sends each element,   x   x   x   of   A   A   A   to   x   x   x   , treated as an element of   B   B   B   :       ι  :    A  →  B   ,    ι   (  x  )    =  x     .     normal-:  ι   formulae-sequence   normal-→  A  B       ι  x   x      \iota:A\rightarrow B,\qquad\iota(x)=x.     A "hooked arrow"   ↪   normal-↪   \hookrightarrow   is sometimes used in place of the function arrow above to denote an inclusion map.  This and other analogous injective functions 2 from substructures are sometimes called natural injections .  Given any morphism  f between objects  X and Y , if there is an inclusion map into the domain     ι  :   A  →  X      normal-:  ι   normal-→  A  X     \iota:A\rightarrow X   , then one can form the restriction  fi of f . In many instances, one can also construct a canonical inclusion into the codomain  R → Y known as the range of f .  Applications of inclusion maps  Inclusion maps tend to be homomorphisms of algebraic structures ; thus, such inclusion maps are embeddings . More precisely, given a sub-structure closed under some operations, the inclusion map will be an embedding for tautological reasons. For example, for a binary operation   ⋆   normal-⋆   \star   , to require that       ι   (   x  ⋆  y   )    =     ι   (  x  )    ⋆  ι    (  y  )          ι   normal-⋆  x  y       normal-⋆    ι  x   ι   y     \iota(x\star y)=\iota(x)\star\iota(y)     is simply to say that   ⋆   normal-⋆   \star   is consistently computed in the sub-structure and the large structure. The case of a unary operation is similar; but one should also look at nullary operations, which pick out a constant element. Here the point is that closure means such constants must already be given in the substructure.  Inclusion maps are seen in algebraic topology where if A is a strong deformation retract of X , the inclusion map yields an isomorphism between all homotopy groups (i.e. is a homotopy equivalence )  Inclusion maps in geometry come in different kinds: for example embeddings of submanifolds . Contravariant objects such as differential forms  restrict to submanifolds, giving a mapping in the other direction . Another example, more sophisticated, is that of affine schemes , for which the inclusions   Spec(R/I) → Spec(R)    and   Spec(R/I 2 ) → Spec(R)    may be different morphisms , where R is a commutative ring and I an ideal .
