}} The Pig-faced Lady of Manchester Square and the Spanish Mule of Madrid, an 1815 cartoon print by George Cruikshank depicting a pig-faced woman and contrasting her with the unpopular Ferdinand VII of Spain. At this time, rumours had spread that such a woman was living in fashionable Manchester Square, and various newspapers (such as the Morning Herald and Morning Chronicle) reported this as fact. Eyewitness accounts, marriage proposals, and tales of attacks by the woman further fanned the flames, and the rumour was recollected as fact as late as the 1860s. Stories of pig-faced women originated in the late 1630s; the last significant work to treat their existence as genuine was published in 1924. {{#if:Print: George Cruikshank|Print: George Cruikshank|}}

A diagram of vernier calipers, a device used to measure the distance between two opposite sides of an object, showing the individual parts: {{ordered list

Outside large jaws: used to measure external diameter or width of an object

Inside small jaws: used to measure internal diameter of an object

Depth probe: used to measure depths of an object or a hole

Main scale in centimeters, marked every millimeter

Main scale in inches, marked every 1/16 of an inch

Vernier scale gives interpolated measurements to 1/20 of a millimeter

Vernier scale gives interpolated measurements to 1/128 of an inch

Retainer: used to block movable part to allow the easy transferring of a measurement }} Here the metric scale shows a distance of 2.475 cm between the jaw faces: the 0 mark on the vernier is between 2.4 and 2.5, and the 7.5 mark is the one best aligned with a mark on the main scale. Similarly, the inch scale shows (15
 
 
 
 )/16, or 125/128, of an inch.

caption= HMAS Australia was a County-class heavy cruiser of the Royal Australian Navy. Laid down in Scotland in 1925, the ship entered service in 1928. She served predominantly in the South-West Pacific until the beginning of World War II, when she was tasked to the northern Atlantic. In 1942, Australia was reassigned as flagship of the ANZAC Squadron, where she supported US naval and amphibious operations throughout South-East Asia. A series of kamikaze attacks during the invasion of Lingayen Gulf led to Australia being recalled for repairs in the United Kingdom, where she remained until the end of the war. In her later years, Australia served as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan and as a training ship. She was sold for scrap in 1955.

caption= An Armenian woman kneeling beside a dead child in a field during the Armenian Genocide, conducted by the government of the Ottoman Empire. The genocide is conventionally held to have begun on 24 April 1915, when Ottoman authorities arrested and later executed some 250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders. Much of the remaining Armenian population were deported into the deserts of Syria, where most died from starvation, exhaustion, and systematic massacres. The total number of people killed has been estimated at between 1 and 1.5 million. Though the events are widely recognized as a genocide by historians, the Turkish government rejects such a description.
