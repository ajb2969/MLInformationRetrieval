   Galactinol—raffinose galactosyltransferase      Galactinol—raffinose galactosyltransferase   In enzymology , a galactinol-raffinose galactosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   alpha-D-galactosyl-(1→3)-1D-myo-inositol + raffinose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   myo-inositol + stachyose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are α-D-galactosyl-(1→3)-1D-myo-inositol and raffinose , whereas its two products are myo-inositol and stachyose .  This enzyme participates in galactose metabolism .  Nomenclature  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha-D-galactosyl-(1→3)-myo-inositol:raffinose galactosyltransferase. Other names in common use include galactinol-raffinose galactosyltransferase, and stachyose synthetase.  References      Preiss, J.
