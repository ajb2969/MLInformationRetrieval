   Sagitta (optics)      Sagitta (optics)   In optics and especially telescope making , sagitta is a measure of the glass removed to yield an optical curve. It is approximated by the formula        S  =    r  2    2  ×  ROC        S     superscript  r  2     2  ROC      S=\frac{r^{2}}{2\times\text{ROC}}        or        S  =    r  2    4  ×  focal length        S     superscript  r  2     4  focal length      S=\frac{r^{2}}{4\times\text{focal length}}        A good explanation both of this approximate formula and the exact formula can be found at http://www.opticampus.com/popcourse.php?url=high_powered/#appendix  See also   Radius of curvature (optics)   "  Category:Optics
