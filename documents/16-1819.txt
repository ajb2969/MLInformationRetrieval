   Draft:Component size distribution (network science)      Draft:Component size distribution (network science)   1  Component size distribution (network science)  Component size distribution is the basic property of undirected graph . The property focuses on the sizes of connected components of vertices in the graph in the regime without a giant component . 2 Distribution of component size shows the number of smaller components expected for a given number of edges,    ⟨  k  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  k    {\left\langle k\right\rangle}   , and their expected sizes.  In a random network  Derivation  For a random network the probability that a randomly chosen node belongs to a component of size   s   s   {s}   is      P  s   ∼      (   s   ⟨  k  ⟩    )    s  -  1     s  !     e   -    ⟨  k  ⟩   s         similar-to   subscript  P  s        superscript    s   delimited-⟨⟩  k      s  1      s     superscript  e       delimited-⟨⟩  k   s        P_{s}\sim\frac{(s\left\langle k\right\rangle)^{s-1}}{s!}{e^{-\left\langle k%
 \right\rangle s}}   . 3  Replace     ⟨  k  ⟩    s  -  1      superscript   delimited-⟨⟩  k     s  1     {\left\langle k\right\rangle^{s-1}}   with    e  x  p   [    (   s  -  1   )   l  n   ⟨  k  ⟩    ]       e  x  p   delimited-[]      s  1   l  n   delimited-⟨⟩  k       {exp\left[(s-1)ln\left\langle k\right\rangle\right]}   , 4  then use the Stirling-formula     s  !   =     2  π  s      (   s  e   )   s          s         2  π  s     superscript    s  e   s      {s!=\sqrt{2\pi s}\left(\frac{s}{e}\right)^{s}}   for large   s   s   {s}   . 5  The obtained result is     P  s   ∼    s   -   3  2      e   -   (   ⟨  k  ⟩   -  1  )   s  +   (  s  -  1  )   l  n   ⟨  k  ⟩   )        similar-to   subscript  P  s      superscript  s      3  2      superscript  e   fragments    fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-⟨  k  normal-⟩    1  normal-)   s    fragments  normal-(  s   1  normal-)   l  n   fragments  normal-⟨  k  normal-⟩   normal-)       {P_{s}\sim s^{-\frac{3}{2}}e^{-(\left\langle k\right\rangle-1)s+(s-1)ln\left%
 \langle k\right\rangle)}}   . 6    Contribution  Therefore, the component size distribution has two contributions: 1. A slowly decreasing power law term    s   -   3  2       superscript  s      3  2      {s^{-\frac{3}{2}}}   , and 2. A rapidly decreasing exponential term    e   -   (   ⟨  k  ⟩   -  1  )   s  +   (  s  -  1  )   l  n   ⟨  k  ⟩   )      superscript  e   fragments    fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-⟨  k  normal-⟩    1  normal-)   s    fragments  normal-(  s   1  normal-)   l  n   fragments  normal-⟨  k  normal-⟩   normal-)     {e^{-(\left\langle k\right\rangle-1)s+(s-1)ln\left\langle k\right\rangle)}}   .  Given that exponential term dominates for large   s   s   {s}   ,     P  s   ∼    s   -   3  2      e   -   (   ⟨  k  ⟩   -  1  )   s  +   (  s  -  1  )   l  n   ⟨  k  ⟩   )        similar-to   subscript  P  s      superscript  s      3  2      superscript  e   fragments    fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-⟨  k  normal-⟩    1  normal-)   s    fragments  normal-(  s   1  normal-)   l  n   fragments  normal-⟨  k  normal-⟩   normal-)       {P_{s}\sim s^{-\frac{3}{2}}e^{-(\left\langle k\right\rangle-1)s+(s-1)ln\left%
 \langle k\right\rangle)}}   predicts that large components are prohibited. The crucial assumption for calculations is that analyzed graph does not have significant clustering. The only exception is at the critical point , where     ⟨  k  ⟩   =  1       delimited-⟨⟩  k   1    {\left\langle k\right\rangle=1}   . 7 In this case all terms in the exponential cancel, thus,    P  s     subscript  P  s    {P_{s}}   follows the power law     P  s   ∼   s   -   3  2        similar-to   subscript  P  s    superscript  s      3  2       {P_{s}\sim s^{-\frac{3}{2}}}   . 8 9 Because of relatively slow decrease of power law, it is expected to observe clusters of widely different sizes at the critical point.   In a peer to peer network  Percolation threshold  The stability of networks are primarily measured in terms of certain fraction of nodes    (   f  c   )     subscript  f  c    {(f_{c})}   called percolation threshold . Its removal disintegrates the network into large number of small, disconnected components. 10 Above that threshold, there exists a connected component which goes through the entire network. This connected component is also termed as the giant component. The value of percolation threshold    f  c     subscript  f  c    {f_{c}}   theoretically signifies the stability of the network, higher value indicates greater stability against churn and attack. 11 It is possible to develop the metric to measure the percolation threshold. 12 To do this, a fraction of nodes    f  t     subscript  f  t    {f_{t}}   should be removed from the network. Then, after each step   t   t   {t}   one should check whether the percolation network is reached. The achieved status of the network should be in terms of component size distribution     C   S  t    (  s  )    =    s   n  s    /    ∑  s    s   n  s            C   subscript  S  t   s       s   subscript  n  s      subscript   s     s   subscript  n  s        {CS_{t}(s)=sn_{s}/\sum_{s}sn_{s}}    13 , where   s   s   {s}   and    n  s     subscript  n  s    {n_{s}}   respectively are the size of the component formed and the number of components of size   s   s   {s}   .  Fig.2.  The below plots represent the change in the component size distribution during percolation process and indicate the percolation point  Example.jpg|(a) Initial component size distribution (only single giant component of size 500) Example.jpg|(b) Intermediate component size distribution. Example.jpg|(c) Component size distribution at percolation point.  Fig. 2(a) shows that at the begining the component size distribution exhibits unimodal characteristics confirming a single connected component. In Fig. 2(b) is seen that at the first stages there is bimodal characteristics confirming a large component together with a set of small components. In turn, the last figure represents that at a particular step    t  =   t  n       t   subscript  t  n     {t=t_{n}}   ,    C   S  t    (  s  )       C   subscript  S  t   s    {CS_{t}(s)}   becomes monotonically decreasing function indicating    t  n     subscript  t  n    {t_{n}}   as percolation point. Therefore    t  n     subscript  t  n    {t_{n}}   is considered as the time step where percolation occurs and the total fraction of nodes at that step    f   t  n      subscript  f   subscript  t  n     {f_{t_{n}}}   specifies the percolation threshold. 14  See also   Network science  Graph theory  Random graph  Peer-to-peer  Percolation threshold  Stirling's approximation   References  "      M.
