Dirichlet integral

In mathematics, there are several integrals known as the Dirichlet integral, after the German mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.
One of those is



This integral is not absolutely convergent, and so the integral is not even defined in the sense of Lebesgue integration, but it is defined in the sense of the improper Riemann integral or the Henstock–Kurzweil integral.1 The value of the integral (in the Riemann or Henstock sense) can be derived in various ways. For example, the value can be determined from attempts to evaluate a double improper integral, or by using differentiation under the integral sign.
Evaluation
Double improper integral method
Pre-knowledge of properties of Laplace transforms allows us to evaluate this Dirichlet integral succinctly in the following manner:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Laplace transform of the function, 
 
 
 
 
 . Applying Euler's formula, then integrating, making the denominator real, and taking the imaginary part, we see the Laplace transform is the function 
 
 
 
 , a function of the Laplace transform variable, s. This is equivalent to attempting to evaluate the same double definite integral in two different ways, by reversal of the order of integration, viz.,






Differentiation under the integral sign
First rewrite the integral as a function of variable 
 
 
 
 . Let



then we need to find 
 
 
 
 .
Differentiate with respect to 
 
 
 
  and apply the Leibniz integral rule to obtain:



This integral was evaluated without proof, above, based on Laplace transform tables; we derive it this time. It is made much simpler by recalling Euler's formula,



then,


 
  where 
 
 
 
  represents the imaginary part.



Integrating with respect to 
 
 
 
 :


 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is a constant to be determined. As,





 
  for some integers m & n. It is easy to show that 
 
 
 
  has to be zero, by analyzing easily observed bounds for this integral:



The left and right bounds can be derived by dividing the integrated region 
 
 
 
 
  into periodic intervals, over which the integrals have zero value.
Left bound
 
 

Right bound
 
 

The second term can be written as 
 
 

Clearly,
 
 

Thus 
 
 

And we are through with the proof.
Extending this result further, with the introduction of another variable, first noting that 
 
 
 
  is an even function and therefore


 
  then:



Complex integration
The same result can be obtained via complex integration. Let's consider



As a function of the complex variable z, it has a simple pole at the origin, which prevents the application of Jordan's lemma, whose other hypotheses are satisfied. We shall then define a new function2 g(z) as follows



The pole has been moved away from the real axis, so g(z) can be integrated along the semicircle of radius R centered at z=0 and closed on the real axis, then the limit 
 
 
 
  should be taken.
The complex integral is zero by the residue theorem, as there are no poles inside the integration path



The second term vanishes as R goes to infinity; for arbitrarily small 
 
 
 
 , the Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem applied to the first one yields



Where P.V. indicates Cauchy principal value. By taking the imaginary part on both sides and noting that 
 
 
 
 
  is even and by definition 
 
 
 
 , we get the desired result



Via the Dirichlet kernel
Let 
 
 
 
  be the Dirichlet kernel.
This is clearly symmetric around zero (that is
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 
 ), and 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 ).
Define 
 
 
 
 . This is continuous on the interval 
 
 
 
 , so is bounded by 
 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , for some constant 
 
 
 
 , and hence 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 .
$\begin{align}\text{So }\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin(x)}{x} dx & = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \int_0^{(2n+1)\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{\sin(x)}{x}dx \\
 & = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_0^\frac{1}{2} \frac{\sin((2n+1)\pi x)}{x} dx \text{ by substituting }x\mapsto (2n+1)\pi x.\\
 & = \pi\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_0^\frac{1}{2}\sin((2n+1)\pi x)\left(f(x)+\frac{1}{\sin(\pi x)}\right)dx \\
 & = \pi\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\int_0^\frac{1}{2}f(x)\sin(2n+1)\pi x)dx + \frac{1}{2}\int_{-\frac{1}{2}}^\frac{1}{2} D_n(x) dx\right) \\
 & = \frac{\pi}{2}\text{ by the above.}\end{align}$
