   Exponential factorial      Exponential factorial   An exponential factorial is a positive integer n  raised to the power of n − 1, which in turn is raised to the power of n − 2, and so on and so forth, that is,       n    (   n  -  1   )     (   n  -  2   )   ⋯     .     superscript  n   superscript    n  1       n  2   normal-⋯      n^{(n-1)^{(n-2)\cdots}}.\,     The exponential factorial can also be defined with the recurrence relation         a  0   =  1   ,    a  n   =   n   a   n  -  1       .     formulae-sequence     subscript  a  0   1      subscript  a  n    superscript  n   subscript  a    n  1        a_{0}=1,\quad a_{n}=n^{a_{n-1}}.\,     The first few exponential factorials are 1 , 1 , 2 , 9 , 262144, etc. . So, for example, 262144 is an exponential factorial since       262144  =   4   3   2  1      .      262144   superscript  4   superscript  3   superscript  2  1       262144=4^{3^{2^{1}}}.\,     The exponential factorials grow much more quickly than regular factorials or even hyperfactorials . The exponential factorial of 5 is 5 262144 which is approximately 6.206069878660874 × 10 183230 .  The sum of the reciprocals of the exponential factorials from 1 onwards is the transcendental number 1.6111149258083767361111... .  Like tetration , there is currently no accepted method of extension of the exponential factorial function to real and complex values of its argument, unlike the factorial function, for which such an extension is provided by the gamma function .  read more   tetratial factorial    pentatial factorial    hexatial factorial   References   Jonathan Sondow, " Exponential Factorial " From Mathworld , a Wolfram Web resource   "  Category:Factorial and binomial topics  Category:Integer sequences  Category:Large integers
