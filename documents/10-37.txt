   Right half-plane      Right half-plane   In complex variables , the right half plane is the set      {    z  ∈   ℂ  :      Re   (  z  )    >  0    }      formulae-sequence    z   ℂ  normal-:        Re  z   0      \{z\in\mathbb{C}\quad:\quad\mbox{Re}(z)>0\}     of all points in the complex plane whose real part is positive,  (Figure)  Righthalfplane.jpg   "  Category:Complex analysis
