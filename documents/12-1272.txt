   Oseen equations      Oseen equations   In fluid dynamics , the Oseen equations (or Oseen flow ) describe the flow of a viscous and incompressible  fluid at small Reynolds numbers , as formulated by Carl Wilhelm Oseen in 1910. Oseen flow is an improved description of these flows, as compared to Stokes flow , by the partial inclusion of convective acceleration . 1  The fundamental solution due to a singular point force embedded in an Oseen flow is the Oseenlet . The closed-form fundamental solutions for generalized unsteady Stokes and Oseen flows associated with arbitrary time-dependent translational and rotational motions have been derived for Newtonian 2 and micropolar 3 fluids.  Using the Oseen equation, Horace Lamb was able to derive improved expressions for the viscous flow around a sphere in 1911, improving on Stokes law towards somewhat higher Reynolds numbers. 4 Also, Lamb derived—for the first time—a solution for the viscous flow around a circular cylinder. 5  The Oseen equations are, in case of an object moving with a steady flow velocity  U through the fluid—which is at rest far from the object—and in a frame of reference attached to the object: 6      -    ρ  𝐔   ⋅   ∇  𝐮         normal-⋅    ρ  𝐔    normal-∇  𝐮      \displaystyle-\rho\mathbf{U}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u}     where   u is the disturbance in flow velocity induced by the moving object, i.e. the total flow velocity in the frame of reference moving with the object is – U + u ,  p is the pressure ,  ρ is the density of the fluid,  μ is the dynamic viscosity ,  ∇ is the gradient operator, and  ∇ 2 is the Laplace operator .   The boundary conditions for the Oseen flow around a rigid object are:     𝐮   𝐮   \displaystyle\mathbf{u}     with r the distance from the object's center, and p ∞ the undisturbed pressure far from the object.
