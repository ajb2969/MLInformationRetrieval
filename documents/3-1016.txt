   Von Neumann bicommutant theorem      Von Neumann bicommutant theorem   In mathematics , specifically functional analysis , the von Neumann bicommutant theorem relates the closure of a set of bounded operators on a Hilbert space in certain topologies to the bicommutant of that set. In essence, it is a connection between the algebraic and topological sides of operator theory .  The formal statement of the theorem is as follows:   Von Neumann Bicommutant Theorem. Let   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   be an algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space   H   H   H   , containing the identity operator and closed under taking adjoints . Then the closures of   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   in the weak operator topology and the strong operator topology are equal, and are in turn equal to the bicommutant     𝐌  ′  ′      𝐌  normal-′  normal-′    \mathbf{M}′′   of   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   . This algebra is the von Neumann algebra generated by   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   .   There are several other topologies on the space of bounded operators, and one can ask what are the *-algebras closed in these topologies. If   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   is closed in the norm topology then it is a C*-algebra , but not necessarily a von Neumann algebra. One such example is the C*-algebra of compact operators (on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space). For most other common topologies the closed *-algebras containing 1 are still von Neumann algebras; this applies in particular to the weak operator, strong operator, *-strong operator, ultraweak , ultrastrong , and *-ultrastrong topologies.  It is related to the Jacobson density theorem .  Proof  Let   H   H   H   be a Hilbert space and    L   (  H  )       L  H    L(H)   the bounded operators on   H   H   H   . Consider a self-adjoint unital subalgebra    𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   of    L   (  H  )       L  H    L(H)   . (this means that   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   contains the adjoints of its members, and the identity operator on   H   H   H   )  The theorem is equivalent to the combination of the following three statements:   (i)   (ii)   (iii)    where the   W   W   W   and   S   S   S   subscripts stand for closures in the weak and strong operator topologies, respectively.  Proof of (i)  By definition of the weak operator topology, for any   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   in   H   H   H   , the map T →  is continuous in this topology. Therefore, for any operator   O   O   O   (and by substituting once and once    x  →  O  x      x  normal-→  O  x    x→Ox   ), so is the map       T  →    ⟨   T  x   ,    O  *   y   ⟩   -   ⟨   T  O  x   ,  y  ⟩    =    ⟨   O  T  x   ,  y  ⟩   -   ⟨   T  O  x   ,  y  ⟩     .       normal-→  T       T  x      superscript  O    y       T  O  x   y              O  T  x   y      T  O  x   y       T\to\langle Tx,O^{*}y\rangle-\langle TOx,y\rangle=\langle OTx,y\rangle-\langle
 TOx%
 ,y\rangle.     Let S be any subset of    L   (  H  )       L  H    L(H)   , and S’ its commutant . For any operator   T   T   T   not in S’ ,  -  is nonzero for some O in S and some x and y in   H   H   H   , and so it has a nonzero open neighborhood. By the continuity of the abovementioned mapping, there is an open neighborhood of   T   T   T   in the weak operator topology for which this is nonzero, therefore this open neighborhood is also not in S’ . Thus S’ is closed in this topology (i.e. it is weakly closed ). Thus every commutant is weakly closed, and so is    𝐌  ′  ′      𝐌  normal-′  normal-′    \mathbf{M}′′   ; since it contains   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   , it also contains its weak closure.  Proof of (ii)  This follows directly from the weak operator topology being coarser than the strong operator topology: for every point   x   x   x   in , every open neighborhood of   x   x   x   in the weak operator topology is also open in the strong operator topology and therefore contains a member of   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   ; therefore   x   x   x   is also a member of .  Proof of (iii)  Let    X  ∈  𝐌  ′  ′      X  normal-∈  𝐌  normal-′  normal-′    X∈\mathbf{M}′′   , we will show . Every open neighborhood   U   U   U   of   X   X   X   in the strong operator topology, is the preimage of V , an open neighborhood of    ∥   X  h   ∥     norm    X  h     \|Xh\|   for some h in   H   H   H   , so that for every O in    L   (  H  )       L  H    L(H)   , O is in   U   U   U   if and only if    ∥   O  h   ∥     norm    O  h     \|Oh\|   is in V . Since V is open, it contains an open ball of radius    d  >  0      d  0    d>0   centered at    ∥   X  h   ∥     norm    X  h     \|Xh\|   .  Consider the closure     c  l   (   𝐌  h   )       c  l    𝐌  h     cl(\mathbf{M}h)   of  It is a vector space that is complete (being a closed subset of a complete space   H   H   H   ), and so has a corresponding orthogonal projection which we denote   P   P   P   .   P   P   P   is bounded, so it is in    L   (  H  )       L  H    L(H)   . Next we prove:   Lemma.     P  ∈  𝐌  ′      P  normal-∈  𝐌  normal-′    P∈\mathbf{M}′   .    Proof. For every    x  ∈  H      x  normal-∈  H    x∈H   ,    P  x  ∈  c  l   (   𝐌  h   )       P  x  normal-∈  c  l    𝐌  h     Px∈cl(\mathbf{M}h)   so it is the limit of a series with in   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   for all   n   n   n   , hence for all    T  ∈  𝐌      T  normal-∈  𝐌    T∈\mathbf{M}   , is also in    𝐌  h      𝐌  h    \mathbf{M}h   and thus its limit is in    c  l   (   𝐌  h   )       c  l    𝐌  h     cl(\mathbf{M}h)   . By continuity of   T   T   T   (since it is in    L   (  H  )       L  H    L(H)   and thus Lipschitz continuous ), this limit is    T  P  x      T  P  x    TPx   . Since    T  P  x  ∈  c  l   (   𝐌  h   )       T  P  x  normal-∈  c  l    𝐌  h     TPx∈cl(\mathbf{M}h)   , PTPx = TPx . From this it follows that PTP = TP for all   T   T   T   in   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   .    By using the closure of   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   under the adjoint we further have, for every   T   T   T   in   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   and all    x  ,   y  ∈  H      x    y  normal-∈  H     x,y∈H   :          ⟨  x  ,   T  P  y   ⟩   =   ⟨  x  ,   P  T  P  y   ⟩   =   ⟨   P  x   ,   T  P  y   ⟩   =   ⟨    T  *   P  x   ,   P  y   ⟩   =   ⟨   P   T  *   P  x   ,  y  ⟩   =   ⟨    T  *   P  x   ,  y  ⟩   =   ⟨   P  x   ,   T  y   ⟩   =   ⟨  x  ,   P  T  y   ⟩          x    T  P  y     x    P  T  P  y            P  x     T  P  y             superscript  T    P  x     P  y            P   superscript  T    P  x   y            superscript  T    P  x   y           P  x     T  y          x    P  T  y       \langle x,TPy\rangle=\langle x,PTPy\rangle=\langle Px,TPy\rangle=\langle T^{*}%
 Px,Py\rangle=\langle PT^{*}Px,y\rangle=\langle T^{*}Px,y\rangle=\langle Px,Ty%
 \rangle=\langle x,PTy\rangle         thus TP = PT and P lies in    𝐌  ′      𝐌  normal-′    \mathbf{M}′   .   By definition of the bicommutant  XP = PX . Since   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   is unital,    h  ∈  𝐌  h      h  normal-∈  𝐌  h    h∈\mathbf{M}h   , hence     X  h   =   X  P  h   =   P  X  h  ∈  c  l   (   𝐌  h   )            X  h     X  P  h          P  X  h  normal-∈  c  l    𝐌  h       Xh=XPh=PXh∈cl(\mathbf{M}h)   and for every    ε  >  0      ε  0    ε>0   , there exists T in   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   with    ε  =  d      ε  d    ε=d     Thus in every open neighborhood   X   X   X   of   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   in the strong operator topology there is a member of   X   X   X   , and so   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   is in the strong operator topology closure of   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   .  Non-unital case  The algebra   H   H   H   is said to be non-degenerate if for all h in    h  =  0      h  0    h=0   ,  implies   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   . If    L   (  H  )       L  H    L(H)   is non-degenerate and a sub C*-algebra of   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   , it can be shown using an approximate identity in   𝐌   𝐌   \mathbf{M}   that the identity operator I lies in the strong closure of $\mathbf{ M } $ . Therefore the bicommutant theorem still holds.  References   W.B. Arveson, An Invitation to C*-algebras , Springer, New York, 1976.
