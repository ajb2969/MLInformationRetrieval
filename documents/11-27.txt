2-oxoglutarate carboxylase

In enzymology, a 2-oxoglutarate carboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + 2-oxoglutarate + HCO3- 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + oxalosuccinate
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, 2-oxoglutarate, and HCO3-, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and oxalosuccinate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ''. Other names in common use include oxalosuccinate synthetase, carboxylating factor for ICDH (incorrect), CFI, and OGC.
