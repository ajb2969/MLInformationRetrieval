   Pocket Cube      Pocket Cube   The Pocket Cube (also known as the Mini Cube or the Ice Cube ) is the 2×2×2 equivalent of a Rubik's Cube . The cube consists of 8 pieces, all corners.  Permutations  Any permutation of the eight corners is possible (8 ! positions), and seven of them can be independently rotated (3 7 positions). There is nothing identifying the orientation of the cube in space, reducing the positions by a factor of 24. This is because all 24 possible positions and orientations of the first corner are equivalent due to the lack of fixed centers. This factor does not appear when calculating the permutations of N×N×N cubes where N is odd, since those puzzles have fixed centers which identify the cube's spatial orientation. The number of possible positions of the cube is          8  !   ×   3  7    24   =    7  !   ×   3  6    =  3   ,   674  ,  160.      formulae-sequence            8    superscript  3  7    24       7    superscript  3  6         3     674  160.     \frac{8!\times 3^{7}}{24}=7!\times 3^{6}=3,674,160.     The maximum number of turns required to solve the cube is up to 11 full turns, or up to 14 quarter turns. 1  The number f of positions that require n full twists and number q of positions that require n quarter turn twists are:      n   f   q       0   1   1     1   9   6     2   54   27     3   321   120     4   1847   534     5   9992   2256     6   50136   8969     7   227536   33058     8   870072   114149     9   1887748   360508     10   623800   930588     11   2644   1350852     12   0   782536     13   0   90280     14   0   276     For the miniature (2 × 2 × 2) Rubik’s cube, the two-generator subgroup (the number of positions generated just by rotations of two adjacent faces) is of order 29,160. 2  Records  Rami Sbahi (USA) holds the current world record of solving the Pocket Cube in competition, with a time of 0.58 seconds set at the Canadian Open 2015. 3  Sbahi also set the record for the best average time of 5 solves at the same event with a time of 1.55 seconds including the individual times of (0.58), 1.46, 1.81, 1.37 and (3.67) (the slowest and fastest times are not counted). 4  See also  (Figure)  Pocket Cube animation.
