   Pierce–Birkhoff conjecture      Pierce–Birkhoff conjecture   In abstract algebra , the Pierce–Birkhoff conjecture asserts that any piecewise-polynomial function can be expressed as a maximum of finite minima of finite collections of polynomials . It was first stated, albeit in non- rigorous and vague wording, in the 1956 paper of Garrett Birkhoff and Richard S. Pierce in which they first introduced f-rings . The modern, rigorous statement of the conjecture was formulated by Melvin Henriksen and John R. Isbell , who worked on the problem in the early 1960s in connection with their work on f-rings. Their formulation is as follows:   for every real piecewise-polynomial function    f  :    R  n   →  R      normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  R  n   R     f:R^{n}\rightarrow R   , there exists a finite set of polynomials     g   i  j    ∈   R   [   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   ]         subscript  g    i  j      R    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n       g_{ij}\in R[x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}]   such that    f  =    sup  i     inf  j    (   g   i  j    )         f    subscript  supremum  i     subscript  infimum  j    subscript  g    i  j        f=\sup_{i}\inf_{j}(g_{ij})   . 1    Isbell is likely the source of the name Pierce–Birkhoff conjecture , and popularized the problem in the 1980s by discussing it with several mathematicians interested in real algebraic geometry . 2  The conjecture was proved true for n = 1 and 2 by Louis Mahé . 3  Local Pierce–Birkhoff conjecture  In 1989, James J. Madden provided an equivalent statement that is in terms of the real spectrum of    A  =   R   [   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   ]        A    R    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n       A=R[x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}]   and the novel concepts of local polynomial representatives and separating ideals.  Denoting the real spectrum of A by    Sper  A      Sper  A    \mathrm{Sper}A   , the ''separating ideal of α and ''β in    Sper  A      Sper  A    \mathrm{Sper}A   is the ideal of A generated by all polynomials    g  ∈  A      g  A    g\in A   that change sign on α and β , ie.      g   (  α  )    ≥  0        g  α   0    g(\alpha)\geq 0   and     g   (  β  )    ≤  0        g  β   0    g(\beta)\leq 0   . Any finite covering     R  n   =    ∪  i    P  i         superscript  R  n     subscript   i    subscript  P  i      R^{n}=\cup_{i}P_{i}   of closed , semi-algebraic sets induces a corresponding covering     Sper  A   =    ∪  i     P  ~   i          Sper  A     subscript   i    subscript   normal-~  P   i      \mathrm{Sper}A=\cup_{i}\tilde{P}_{i}   , so, in particular, when f is piecewise polynomial, there is a polynomial    f  i     subscript  f  i    f_{i}   for every    α  ∈   Sper  A       α    Sper  A     \alpha\in\mathrm{Sper}A   such that      f  |    P  i    =     f  i   |    P  i         evaluated-at  f   subscript  P  i     evaluated-at   subscript  f  i    subscript  P  i      f|_{P_{i}}=f_{i}|_{P_{i}}   and    α  ∈    P  ~   i       α   subscript   normal-~  P   i     \alpha\in\tilde{P}_{i}   . This    f  i     subscript  f  i    f_{i}   is termed the ''local polynomial representative of f at ''α.  Madden's so-called ''local Pierce–Birkhoff conjecture at α and ''β, which is equivalent to the Pierce–Birkhoff conjecture, is as follows:   Let α , β be in    Sper  A      Sper  A    \mathrm{Sper}A   and f be piecewise-polynomial. It is conjectured that for every local representative of f at α ,    f  α     subscript  f  α    f_{\alpha}   , and local representative of f at β ,    f  β     subscript  f  β    f_{\beta}   ,     f  α   -   f  β        subscript  f  α    subscript  f  β     f_{\alpha}-f_{\beta}   is in the separating ideal of α and β . 4    References    Further reading       "  Category:Conjectures  Category:Real algebraic geometry     ↩   ↩
