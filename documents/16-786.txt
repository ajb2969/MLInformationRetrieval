   Bundle theorem      Bundle theorem   In geometry, the bundle theorem is in the simplest case a statement on six circles and eight points in the real Euclidean plane. In general it is a property of a M√∂bius plane that is fulfilled by ovoidal M√∂bius planes only.  The bundle theorem should not be confused with Miquel's theorem .  An ovoidal M√∂bius plane in real Euclidean space may be considered as the geometry of the plane sections of an egglike surface, like a sphere or an ellipsoid or a half of a sphere clued to a suitable half of an ellipsoid or the surface with equation      x  4   +   y  4   +   z  4    =  1         superscript  x  4    superscript  y  4    superscript  z  4    1    x^{4}+y^{4}+z^{4}=1   , .... If the egglike surface ist just a sphere one gets the space model of the classical real M√∂bius plane , the circle geometry on the sphere.  The essential property of an ovoidal M√∂bius plane is the existence of a space model via an ovoid. An ovoid in a 3-dimensional projective space is a set of points, which a) is intersected by lines in 0, 1, or 2 points and b) its tangents at an arbitrary point covers a plane (tangent plane). The geometry of an ovoid in projective 3-space is a M√∂bius plane, called ovoidal M√∂bius plane . The point set of the geometry consists of the points of the ovoid and the curves (cycles) are the plane sections of the ovoid. A suitable stereographical projection shows: For any ovoidal M√∂bius plane there exists a plane model. 1 In the classical case the plane model is the geometry of the circles and lines (any line is completed by a point   ‚àû     \infty   ). The bundle theorem has a planar and a spacial interpretation. In the planar model there may be lines involved. The proof of the bundle theorem is performed within the spacial model.  For any ovoidal M√∂bius plane   ùîê   ùîê   \mathfrak{M}   the bundle theorem holds:  Bundle theorem:   If for different points     A  1   ,   A  2   ,   A  3   ,   A  4   ,   B  1   ,   B  2   ,   B  3   ,   B  4       subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2    subscript  A  3    subscript  A  4    subscript  B  1    subscript  B  2    subscript  B  3    subscript  B  4     A_{1},A_{2},A_{3},A_{4},B_{1},B_{2},B_{3},B_{4}   five of the six quadruples     c  23   ,   c  34   ,   c  24       subscript  c  23    subscript  c  34    subscript  c  24     c_{23},c_{34},c_{24}   , then the 6th quadruple is concyclic, too. 2   The proof is a consequence of the following considerations, which use essentially the fact, that three planes in a 3-dimensional projective space intersect in a single point:   The planes containing the cycles   P   P   P   intersect in a point   P   P   P   . Hence      A  2    B  2    ,    A  4    B  4          subscript  A  2    subscript  B  2       subscript  A  4    subscript  B  4      A_{2}B_{2},\ A_{4}B_{4}   is the intersection point of the lines (in space !)     c  12   ,   c  14   ,   c  24       subscript  c  12    subscript  c  14    subscript  c  24     c_{12},c_{14},c_{24}   .  The planes containing the cycles    P  ‚Ä≤     superscript  P  normal-‚Ä≤    P^{\prime}   intersect in a point    P  ‚Ä≤     superscript  P  normal-‚Ä≤    P^{\prime}   . Hence      A  2    B  2    ,    A  4    B  4          subscript  A  2    subscript  B  2       subscript  A  4    subscript  B  4      A_{2}B_{2},\ A_{4}B_{4}   is the intersection point of the lines    P  =   P  ‚Ä≤       P   superscript  P  normal-‚Ä≤     P=P^{\prime}   , too.   This yields: a)      A  1    B  1    ,    A  3    B  3          subscript  A  1    subscript  B  1       subscript  A  3    subscript  B  3      A_{1}B_{1},\ A_{3}B_{3}   and b)   P   P   P   intersect at point     A  1   ,   B  1   ,   A  3   ,   B  3       subscript  A  1    subscript  B  1    subscript  A  3    subscript  B  3     A_{1},B_{1},A_{3},B_{3}   , too. The last statement means   P   P   P   are concyclic. The planes involved have point $P$ in common, they are elements of a bundle of planes.  The importance of the bundle theorem was shown by Jeff Kahn .  Theorem of Kahn: A M√∂bius plane is ovoidal if and only if it fulfills the bundle theorem ,. 3  The bundle theorem has an analogous meaning for M√∂bius planes as the Theorem of Desargues for projective planes . From the bundle theorem follows the existence of a) a skewfield (division ring) and b) an ovoid. If the more strict theorem of Miquel holds, the skewfield is even commutative (field) and the ovoid is a quadric .  Remark: There are M√∂bius planes, which are not ovoidal. 4  Remark: For ovoidal Laguerre planes there exists a bundle theorem with an analogous meaning, too. 5  References    Sources   Hartmann, Erich.
