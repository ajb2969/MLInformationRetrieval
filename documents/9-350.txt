Spectral set

In operator theory, a set 
 
 
 
  is said to be a spectral set for a (possibly unbounded) linear operator 
 
 
 
  on a Banach space if the spectrum of 
 
 
 
  is in 
 
 
 
  and von-Neumann's inequality holds for 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  - i.e. for all rational functions 
 
 
 
  with no poles on 
 
 




This concept is related to the topic of analytic functional calculus of operators. In general, one wants to get more details about the operators constructed from functions with the original operator as the variable.
