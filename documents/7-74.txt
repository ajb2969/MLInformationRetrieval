   Landau prime ideal theorem      Landau prime ideal theorem   In algebraic number theory , the prime ideal theorem is the number field generalization of the prime number theorem . It provides an asymptotic formula for counting the number of prime ideals of a number field K , with norm at most X .  Example  What to expect can be seen already for the Gaussian integers . There for any prime number p of the form 4 n + 1, p factors as a product of two Gaussian primes of norm p . Primes of the form 4 n + 3 remain prime, giving a Gaussian prime of norm p 2 . Therefore we should estimate       2  r   (  X  )    +    r  ′    (   X   )          2  r  X      superscript  r  normal-′     X      2r(X)+r^{\prime}(\sqrt{X})     where r counts primes in the arithmetic progression 4 n + 1, and r ′ in the arithmetic progression 4 n + 3. By the quantitative form of Dirichlet's theorem on primes , each of r ( Y ) and r ′( Y ) is asymptotically       Y   2   log  Y     .      Y    2    Y      \frac{Y}{2\log Y}.     Therefore the 2 r ( X ) term predominates, and is asymptotically       X   log  X    .      X    X     \frac{X}{\log X}.     General number fields  This general pattern holds for number fields in general, so that the prime ideal theorem is dominated by the ideals of norm a prime number. As Edmund Landau proved in , for norm at most X the same asymptotic formula      X   log  X       X    X     \frac{X}{\log X}     always holds. Heuristically this is because the logarithmic derivative of the Dedekind zeta-function of K always has a simple pole with residue −1 at s = 1.  As with the Prime Number Theorem, a more precise estimate may be given in terms of the logarithmic integral function . The number of prime ideals of norm ≤ X is      Li   (  X  )   +   O  K    (  X  exp   (  -   c  K     log   (  X  )     )   ,      fragments  Li   fragments  normal-(  X  normal-)     subscript  O  K    fragments  normal-(  X    fragments  normal-(    subscript  c  K       X    normal-)   normal-,     \mathrm{Li}(X)+O_{K}(X\exp(-c_{K}\sqrt{\log(X)}),\,     where c K is a constant depending on K .
