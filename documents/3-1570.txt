   Bicategory      Bicategory   In mathematics , a bicategory is a concept in category theory used to extend the notion of category to handle the cases where the composition of morphisms is not (strictly) associative , but only associative up to an isomorphism. The notion was introduced in 1967 by Jean B√©nabou .  Formally, a bicategory B consists of:   objects a , b ... called 0-cells ;  morphisms f , g , ... with fixed source and target objects called 1-cells ;  "morphisms between morphisms" œÅ, œÉ... with fixed source and target morphisms (which should have themselves the same source and the same target), called 2-cells ;   with some more structure:   given two objects a and b there is a category B ( a , b ) whose objects are the 1-cells and morphisms are the 2-cells, the composition in this category is called vertical composition ;  given three objects a , b and c , there is a bifunctor    *  :  ùêÅ   (  b  ,  c  )   √ó  ùêÅ   (  a  ,  b  )   ‚Üí  ùêÅ   (  a  ,  c  )      fragments   normal-:  B   fragments  normal-(  b  normal-,  c  normal-)    B   fragments  normal-(  a  normal-,  b  normal-)   normal-‚Üí  B   fragments  normal-(  a  normal-,  c  normal-)     *:\mathbf{B}(b,c)\times\mathbf{B}(a,b)\to\mathbf{B}(a,c)   called horizontal composition .   The horizontal composition is required to be associative up to a natural isomorphism Œ± between morphisms    h  *   (   g  *  f   )       h    g  f     h*(g*f)   and     (   h  *  g   )   *  f        h  g   f    (h*g)*f   . Some more coherence axioms, similar to those needed for monoidal categories , are moreover required to hold.  Bicategories may be considered as a weakening of the definition of 2-categories . A similar process for 3-categories leads to tricategories , and more generally to weak n -categories for n -categories .  References   J. B√©nabou. "Introduction to bicategories, part I".
