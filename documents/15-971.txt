Projection formula

In algebraic geometry, the projection formula states that,12 for a quasi-compact separated morphism of schemes

 
 , a quasi-coherent sheaf

 
  on X, a locally free sheaf

 
  on Y, the natural maps of sheaves


 
  are isomorphisms.
There is yet another projection formula in the setting of étale cohomology.
