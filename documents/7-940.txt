   Reflective subcategory      Reflective subcategory   In mathematics , a full subcategory  A of a category  B is said to be reflective in B when the inclusion functor from A to B has a left adjoint . This adjoint is sometimes called a reflector . Dually, A is said to be coreflective in B when the inclusion functor has a right adjoint .  Informally, a reflector acts as a kind of completion operation. It adds in any "missing" pieces of the structure in such a way that reflecting it again has no further effect.  Definition  A full subcategory A of a category B is said to be reflective in B if for each B -object B there exists an A -object    A  B     subscript  A  B    A_{B}   and a B - morphism      r  B   :   B  ‚Üí   A  B       normal-:   subscript  r  B    normal-‚Üí  B   subscript  A  B      r_{B}\colon B\to A_{B}   such that for each B -morphism    f  :   B  ‚Üí  A      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  B  A     f\colon B\to A   there exists a unique A -morphism     f  ¬Ø   :    A  B   ‚Üí  A      normal-:   normal-¬Ø  f    normal-‚Üí   subscript  A  B   A     \overline{f}\colon A_{B}\to A   with      f  ¬Ø   ‚àò   r  B    =  f         normal-¬Ø  f    subscript  r  B    f    \overline{f}\circ r_{B}=f   .      The pair    (   A  B   ,   r  B   )      subscript  A  B    subscript  r  B     (A_{B},r_{B})   is called the A-reflection of B . The morphism    r  B     subscript  r  B    r_{B}   is called A-reflection arrow. (Although often, for the sake of brevity, we speak about    A  B     subscript  A  B    A_{B}   only as about the A -reflection of B ).  This is equivalent to saying that the embedding functor    E  :   ùêÄ  ‚Ü™  ùêÅ      normal-:  E   normal-‚Ü™  ùêÄ  ùêÅ     E\colon\mathbf{A}\hookrightarrow\mathbf{B}   is adjoint. The coadjoint functor    R  :   ùêÅ  ‚Üí  ùêÄ      normal-:  R   normal-‚Üí  ùêÅ  ùêÄ     R\colon\mathbf{B}\to\mathbf{A}   is called the reflector . The map    r  B     subscript  r  B    r_{B}   is the unit of this adjunction.  The reflector assigns to   B   B   B   the A -object    A  B     subscript  A  B    A_{B}   and    R  f      R  f    Rf   for a B -morphism   f   f   f   is determined by the commuting diagram      If all A -reflection arrows are (extremal) epimorphisms , then the subcategory A is said to be (extremal) epireflective . Similarly, it is bireflective if all reflection arrows are bimorphisms .  All these notions are special case of the common generalization ‚Äî    E   E   E   -reflective subcategory, where   E   E   E   is a class of morphisms.  The    E   E   E   -reflective hull of a class A of objects is defined as the smallest   E   E   E   -reflective subcategory containing A . Thus we can speak about reflective hull, epireflective hull, extremal epireflective hull, etc.  An anti-reflective subcategory is a full subcategory A such that the only objects of B that have an A -reflection arrow are those that are already in A .  Dual notions to the above mentioned notions are coreflection, coreflection arrow, (mono)coreflective subcategory, coreflective hull, anti-coreflective subcategory.  Examples  Algebra   The category of abelian groups  Ab is a reflective subcategory of the category of groups , Grp . The reflector is the functor which sends each group to its abelianization . In its turn, the category of groups is a reflective subcategory of the category of inverse semigroups . 1  Similarly, the category of commutative associative algebras is a reflective subcategory of all associative algebras, where the reflector is quotienting out by the commutator ideal . This is used in the construction of the symmetric algebra from the tensor algebra .  Dually, the category of anti-commutative associative algebras is a reflective subcategory of all associative algebras, where the reflector is quotienting out by the anti-commutator ideal. This is used in the construction of the exterior algebra from the tensor algebra .  The category of fields is a reflective subcategory of the category of integral domains (with injective ring homomorphisms as morphisms). The reflector is the functor which sends each integral domain to its field of fractions .  The category of abelian torsion groups is a coreflective subcategory of the category of abelian groups . The coreflector is the functor sending each group to its torsion subgroup .  The categories of elementary abelian groups , abelian p -groups, and p -groups are all reflective subcategories of the category of groups, and the kernels of the reflection maps are important objects of study; see focal subgroup theorem .   Topology   Kolmogorov spaces (T 0 spaces) are a reflective subcategory of Top , the category of topological spaces , and the Kolmogorov quotient is the reflector.  The category of completely regular spaces  CReg is a reflective subcategory of Top . By taking Kolmogorov quotients , one sees that the subcategory of Tychonoff spaces is also reflective.  The category of all compact  Hausdorff spaces is a reflective subcategory of the category of all Tychonoff spaces. The reflector is given by the Stone‚Äìƒåech compactification .  The category of all complete metric spaces with uniformly continuous mappings is a reflective subcategory of the category of metric spaces. The reflector is the completion of a metric space on objects, and the extension by density on arrows.   Functional analysis   The category of Banach spaces is a reflective subcategory of the category of normed spaces and bounded linear operators . The reflector is the norm completion functor.   Category theory   For any Grothendieck site  (C,J) , the topos of sheaves on (C,J) is a reflective subcategory of the topos of presheaves on C , with the special further property that the reflector functor is left exact . The reflector is the sheafification functor  a : Presh(C) ‚Üí Sh(C,J) , and the adjoint pair (a,i) is an important example of a geometric morphism in topos theory.
