   Central polynomial      Central polynomial   In algebra, a central polynomial for n -by- n matrices is a polynomial in non-commuting variables that is non-constant but yields a scalar matrix whenever it is evaluated at n -by- n matrices. That such polynomials exist for any square matrices was discovered in 1970 independently by Formanek and Razmyslov. The term "central" is because the evaluation of a central polynomial has the image lying in the center of the matrix ring over any commutative ring. The notion has an application to the theory of polynomial identity rings .  Example     (    x  y   -   y  x    )   2     superscript      x  y     y  x    2    (xy-yx)^{2}   is a central polynomial for 2-by-2-matrices. Indeed, by the Cayleyâ€“Hamilton theorem , one has that      (    x  y   -   y  x    )   2   =   -   det    (    x  y   -   y  x    )   I          superscript      x  y     y  x    2             x  y     y  x    I       (xy-yx)^{2}=-\det(xy-yx)I   for any 2-by-2-matrices x , y .
