   Methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase      Methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase   In enzymology , a methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   10-formyltetrahydrofolate + L -methionyl-tRNA fMet + H 2 O    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    tetrahydrofolate + N -formylmethionyl-tRNA fMet    This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases that transfer one-carbon groups, specifically the hydroxymethyl-, formyl- and related transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 10-formyltetrahydrofolate:L-methionyl-tRNA N-formyltransferase . Other names in common use include N10-formyltetrahydrofolic-methionyl-transfer ribonucleic , transformylase , formylmethionyl-transfer ribonucleic synthetase , methionyl ribonucleic formyltransferase , methionyl-tRNA Met formyltransferase , methionyl-tRNA transformylase , methionyl-transfer RNA transformylase , methionyl-transfer ribonucleate methyltransferase , and methionyl-transfer ribonucleic transformylase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : methionine metabolism , one carbon pool by folate , and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis.  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
