Sturm series

In mathematics, the Sturm series1 associated with a pair of polynomials is named after Jacques Charles François Sturm.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  two univariate polynomials. Suppose that they do not have a common root and the degree of 
 
 
 
  is greater than the degree of 
 
 
 
 . The Sturm series is constructed by:


 
  This is almost the same algorithm as Euclid's but the remainder 
 
 
 
  has negative sign.
Sturm series associated to a characteristic polynomial
Let us see now Sturm series 
 
 
 
  associated to a characteristic polynomial

 
  in the variable 
 
 
 
 :


 
  where 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  are rational functions in 
 
 
 
  with the coordinate set 
 
 
 
 . The series begins with two polynomials obtained by dividing 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  represents the imaginary unit equal to 
 
 
 
  and separate real and imaginary parts:



The remaining terms are defined with the above relation. Due to the special structure of these polynomials, they can be written in the form:


 
  In these notations, the quotient 
 
 
 
  is equal to 
 
 
 
  which provides the condition 
 
 
 
 . Moreover, the polynomial 
 
 
 
 
  replaced in the above relation gives the following recursive formulas for computation of the coefficients 
 
 
 
 .


 
  If 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 
 , the quotient 
 
 
 
  is a higher degree polynomial and the sequence 
 
 
 
  stops at 
 
 
 
  with $h.
