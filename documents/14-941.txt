   Induced character      Induced character   In mathematics , an induced character is the character of the representation  V of a finite group  G  induced from a representation W of a subgroup  H ≤ G . More generally, there is also a notion of induction     Ind   (  f  )      Ind  f    \operatorname{Ind}(f)   of a class function  f on H given by the formula         Ind   (  f  )     (  s  )    =    1   |  H  |      ∑    t  ∈  G   ,     t   -  1    s  t   ∈  H      f   (    t   -  1    s  t   )       .        Ind  f   s       1    H      subscript    formulae-sequence    t  G        superscript  t    1    s  t   H       f     superscript  t    1    s  t        \operatorname{Ind}(f)(s)=\frac{1}{|H|}\sum_{t\in G,\ t^{-1}st\in H}f(t^{-1}st).     If f is a character of the representation W of H , then this formula for    Ind   (  f  )      Ind  f    \operatorname{Ind}(f)   calculates the character of the induced representation V of G . 1  The basic result on induced characters is Brauer's theorem on induced characters . It states that every irreducible character on G is a linear combination with integer coefficients of characters induced from elementary subgroups .  References  "  Category:Group theory     .
