   Tree (descriptive set theory)      Tree (descriptive set theory)   In descriptive set theory , a tree on a set   X   X   X   is a collection of finite sequences of elements of   X   X   X   such that every prefix of a sequence in the collection also belongs to the collection.  Definitions  Trees  The collection of all finite sequences of elements of a set   X   X   X   is denoted    X    <  ω      superscript  X    absent  ω     X^{<\omega}   . With this notation, a tree is a nonempty subset   T   T   T   of    X    <  ω      superscript  X    absent  ω     X^{<\omega}   , such that if    ⟨   x  0   ,   x  1   ,  …  ,   x   n  -  1    ⟩      subscript  x  0    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x    n  1      \langle x_{0},x_{1},\ldots,x_{n-1}\rangle   is a sequence of length   n   n   n   in   T   T   T   , and if   T   T   T   also belongs to    m  =  0      m  0    m=0   . In particular, choosing   T   T   T   shows that the empty sequence belongs to every tree.  Branches and bodies  A branch through a tree   X   X   X   is an infinite sequence of elements of   T   T   T   , each of whose finite prefixes belongs to   T   T   T   . The set of all branches through    [  T  ]     delimited-[]  T    [T]   is denoted   T   T   T   and called the body of the tree   T   T   T   .  A tree that has no branches is called wellfounded ; a tree with at least one branch is illfounded . By König's lemma , a tree on a finite set with an infinite number of sequences must necessarily be illfounded.  Terminal nodes  A finite sequence that belongs to a tree   T   T   T   is called a terminal node if it is not a prefix of a longer sequence in     ⟨   x  0   ,   x  1   ,  …  ,   x   n  -  1    ⟩   ∈  T        subscript  x  0    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x    n  1     T    \langle x_{0},x_{1},\ldots,x_{n-1}\rangle\in T   . Equivalently,   x   x   x   is terminal if there is no element   X   X   X   of     ⟨   x  0   ,   x  1   ,  …  ,   x   n  -  1    ,  x  ⟩   ∈  T        subscript  x  0    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x    n  1    x   T    \langle x_{0},x_{1},\ldots,x_{n-1},x\rangle\in T   such that that   T   T   T   . A tree that does not have any terminal nodes is called pruned .  Relation to other types of trees  In graph theory , a rooted tree is a directed graph in which every vertex except for a special root vertex has exactly one outgoing edge, and in which the path formed by following these edges from any vertex eventually leads to the root vertex. If   T   T   T   is a tree in the descriptive set theory sense, then it corresponds to a graph with one vertex for each sequence in   T   T   T   , and an outgoing edge from each nonempty sequence that connects it to the shorter sequence formed by removing its last element. This graph is a tree in the graph-theoretic sense. The root of the tree is the empty sequence.  In order theory , a different notion of a tree is used: an order-theoretic tree is a partially ordered set with one minimal element in which each element has a well-ordered set of predecessors. Every tree in descriptive set theory is also an order-theoretic tree, using a partial ordering in which two sequences   U   U   U   and   U   U   U   are ordered by   X   X   X   is a proper prefix of    X  ω     superscript  X  ω    X^{\omega}   . The empty sequence is the unique minimal element, and each element has a finite and well-ordered set of predecessors (the set of all of its prefixes). An order-theoretic tree may be represented by an isomorphic tree of sequences if and only if each of its elements has finite height (that is, a finite set of predecessors).  Topology  The set of infinite sequences over   C   C   C   (denoted as    X  ω     superscript  X  ω    X^{\omega}   ) may be given the product topology , treating X as a discrete space . In this topology, every closed subset    [  T  ]     delimited-[]  T    [T]   of   T   T   T   is of the form   T   T   T   for some pruned tree   C   C   C   . Namely, let    [  T  ]     delimited-[]  T    [T]   consist of the set of finite prefixes of the infinite sequences in   T   T   T   . Conversely, the body    X  ×  Y      X  Y    X\times Y   of every tree     (   X  ×  Y   )     <  ω      superscript    X  Y     absent  ω     (X\times Y)^{<\omega}   forms a closed set in this topology.  Frequently trees on Cartesian products      X    <  ω    ×   Y    <  ω         superscript  X    absent  ω     superscript  Y    absent  ω      X^{<\omega}\times Y^{<\omega}   are considered. In this case, by convention, the set of finite sequences of members of the product space,    [  T  ]     delimited-[]  T    [T]   , is identified in the natural way with a subset of the product of two spaces of sequences,     X    <  ω    ×   Y    <  ω         superscript  X    absent  ω     superscript  Y    absent  ω      X^{<\omega}\times Y^{<\omega}   (the subset of members of the second product for which both sequences have the same length). In this way a tree    [  T  ]     delimited-[]  T    [T]   over the product space may be considered as a subset of    p   [  T  ]   =   {   x  →   ∈   X  ω   |   (  ∃   y  →   ∈   Y  ω   )    ⟨   x  →   ,   y  →   ⟩   ∈   [  T  ]   }      fragments  p   fragments  normal-[  T  normal-]     fragments  normal-{   normal-→  x     superscript  X  ω   normal-|   fragments  normal-(    normal-→  y     superscript  Y  ω   normal-)    fragments  normal-⟨   normal-→  x   normal-,   normal-→  y   normal-⟩     fragments  normal-[  T  normal-]   normal-}     p[T]=\{\vec{x}\in X^{\omega}|(\exists\vec{y}\in Y^{\omega})\langle\vec{x},\vec%
 {y}\rangle\in[T]\}   . We may then form the projection of $[T]$ ,  $$p[T]=\{\vec x\in X^{\omega} | (\exists \vec y\in Y^{\omega})\langle \vec x,\vec y\rangle \in [T]\}$$ .
