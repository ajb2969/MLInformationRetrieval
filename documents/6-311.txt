Tree (descriptive set theory)

In descriptive set theory, a tree on a set 
 
 
 
  is a collection of finite sequences of elements of 
 
 
 
  such that every prefix of a sequence in the collection also belongs to the collection.
Definitions
Trees
The collection of all finite sequences of elements of a set 
 
 
 
  is denoted 
 
 
 
 . With this notation, a tree is a nonempty subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , such that if 
 
 
 
  is a sequence of length 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , and if 
 
 
 
  also belongs to 
 
 
 
 . In particular, choosing 
 
 
 
  shows that the empty sequence belongs to every tree.
Branches and bodies
A branch through a tree 
 
 
 
  is an infinite sequence of elements of 
 
 
 
 , each of whose finite prefixes belongs to 
 
 
 
 . The set of all branches through 
 
 
 
  is denoted 
 
 
 
  and called the body of the tree 
 
 
 
 .
A tree that has no branches is called wellfounded; a tree with at least one branch is illfounded. By KÃ¶nig's lemma, a tree on a finite set with an infinite number of sequences must necessarily be illfounded.
Terminal nodes
A finite sequence that belongs to a tree 
 
 
 
  is called a terminal node if it is not a prefix of a longer sequence in 
 
 
 
 . Equivalently, 
 
 
 
  is terminal if there is no element 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that that 
 
 
 
 . A tree that does not have any terminal nodes is called pruned.
Relation to other types of trees
In graph theory, a rooted tree is a directed graph in which every vertex except for a special root vertex has exactly one outgoing edge, and in which the path formed by following these edges from any vertex eventually leads to the root vertex. If 
 
 
 
  is a tree in the descriptive set theory sense, then it corresponds to a graph with one vertex for each sequence in 
 
 
 
 , and an outgoing edge from each nonempty sequence that connects it to the shorter sequence formed by removing its last element. This graph is a tree in the graph-theoretic sense. The root of the tree is the empty sequence.
In order theory, a different notion of a tree is used: an order-theoretic tree is a partially ordered set with one minimal element in which each element has a well-ordered set of predecessors. Every tree in descriptive set theory is also an order-theoretic tree, using a partial ordering in which two sequences 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are ordered by 
 
 
 
  is a proper prefix of 
 
 
 
 . The empty sequence is the unique minimal element, and each element has a finite and well-ordered set of predecessors (the set of all of its prefixes). An order-theoretic tree may be represented by an isomorphic tree of sequences if and only if each of its elements has finite height (that is, a finite set of predecessors).
Topology
The set of infinite sequences over 
 
 
 
  (denoted as 
 
 
 
 ) may be given the product topology, treating X as a discrete space. In this topology, every closed subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is of the form 
 
 
 
  for some pruned tree 
 
 
 
 . Namely, let 
 
 
 
  consist of the set of finite prefixes of the infinite sequences in 
 
 
 
 . Conversely, the body 
 
 
 
  of every tree 
 
 
 
  forms a closed set in this topology.
Frequently trees on Cartesian products

 
  are considered. In this case, by convention, the set of finite sequences of members of the product space, 
 
 
 
 , is identified in the natural way with a subset of the product of two spaces of sequences, 
 
 
 
  (the subset of members of the second product for which both sequences have the same length). In this way a tree 
 
 
 
  over the product space may be considered as a subset of 
 
 
 
 . We may then form the projection of $[T]$,
$$p[T]=\{\vec x\in X^{\omega} | (\exists \vec y\in Y^{\omega})\langle \vec x,\vec y\rangle \in [T]\}$$.
