   Dirac measure      Dirac measure   (Figure)  A diagram showing all possible subsets of a 3-point set    {  x  ,  y  ,  z  }     x  y  z    \{x,y,z\}   . The Dirac measure    δ  x     subscript  δ  x    \delta_{x}   assigns a size of 1 to all sets in the upper-left half of the diagram and 0 to all sets in the lower-right half.   In mathematics , a Dirac measure assigns a size to a set based solely on whether it contains a fixed point x or not. It is one way of formalizing the idea of the Dirac delta function , an important tool in physics and engineering.  Definition  A Dirac measure is a measure  δ x on a set X (with any σ -algebra of subsets of X ) defined for a given x ∈ X and any (measurable) set  A ⊆ X by        δ  x    (  A  )    =    1  A    (  x  )    =   {      0  ,       x  ∉  A   ;        1  ,       x  ∈  A   .                subscript  δ  x   A      subscript  1  A   x         cases  0    x  A   1    x  A       \delta_{x}(A)=1_{A}(x)=\begin{cases}0,&x\not\in A;\\
 1,&x\in A.\end{cases}   where    1  A     subscript  1  A    1_{A}   is the indicator function of   A   A   A   .  The Dirac measure is a probability measure , and in terms of probability it represents the almost sure outcome x in the sample space  X . We can also say that the measure is a single atom at x ; however, treating the Dirac measure as an atomic measure is not correct when we consider the sequential definition of Dirac delta, as the limit of a delta sequence . The Dirac measures are the extreme points of the convex set of probability measures on X .  The name is a back-formation from the Dirac delta function , considered as a Schwartz distribution , for example on the real line ; measures can be taken to be a special kind of distribution. The identity         ∫  X    f   (  y  )   d   δ  x    (  y  )     =   f   (  x  )     ,        subscript   X     f  y  normal-d   subscript  δ  x   y      f  x     \int_{X}f(y)\,\mathrm{d}\delta_{x}(y)=f(x),   which, in the form         ∫  X    f   (  y  )    δ  x    (  y  )   d  y    =   f   (  x  )     ,        subscript   X     f  y   subscript  δ  x   y  normal-d  y      f  x     \int_{X}f(y)\delta_{x}(y)\,\mathrm{d}y=f(x),   is often taken to be part of the definition of the "delta function", holds as a theorem of Lebesgue integration .  Properties of the Dirac measure  Let δ x denote the Dirac measure centred on some fixed point x in some measurable space ( X , Σ).   δ x is a probability measure, and hence a finite measure.   Suppose that ( X , T ) is a topological space and that Σ is at least as fine as the Borel σ -algebra  σ ( T ) on X .   δ x is a strictly positive measure  if and only if the topology T is such that x lies within every non-empty open set, e.g. in the case of the trivial topology {∅, X }.  Since δ x is probability measure, it is also a locally finite measure .  If X is a Hausdorff topological space with its Borel σ -algebra, then δ x satisfies the condition to be an inner regular measure , since singleton sets such as { x } are always compact . Hence, δ x is also a Radon measure .  Assuming that the topology T is fine enough that { x } is closed, which is the case in most applications, the support of δ x is { x }. (Otherwise, supp( δ x ) is the closure of { x } in ( X , T ).) Furthermore, δ x is the only probability measure whose support is { x }.  If X is n -dimensional Euclidean space  R n with its usual σ -algebra and n -dimensional Lebesgue measure  λ n , then δ x is a singular measure with respect to λ n : simply decompose R n as A = R n \ { x } and B = { x } and observe that δ x ( A ) = λ n ( B ) = 0.   Generalizations  A discrete measure is similar to the Dirac measure, except that it is concentrated at countably many points instead of a single point. More formally, a measure on the real line is called a discrete measure (in respect to the Lebesgue measure ) if its support is at most a countable set .
