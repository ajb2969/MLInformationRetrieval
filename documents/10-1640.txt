   Dodecenoyl-CoA isomerase      Dodecenoyl-CoA isomerase   In enzymology , a dodecenoyl-CoA isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (3Z)-dodec-3-enoyl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (2E)-dodec-2-enoyl-CoA   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (3Z)-dodec-3-enoyl-CoA , and one product , (2E)-dodec-2-enoyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases transposing C=C bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dodecenoyl-CoA (3Z)-(2E)-isomerase . Other names in common use include dodecenoyl-CoA Delta-isomerase , Delta3-cis-Delta2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase , acetylene-allene isomerase , dodecenoyl-CoA Delta-isomerase , and dodecenoyl-CoA Delta3-cis-Delta2-trans-isomerase . This enzyme participates in fatty acid metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 12 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , and .
