   Pontryagin class      Pontryagin class   In mathematics , the Pontryagin classes , named for Lev Pontryagin , are certain characteristic classes . The Pontryagin class lies in cohomology groups with degree a multiple of four. It applies to real vector bundles .  Definition  Given a real vector bundle E over M , its k -th Pontryagin class p k ( E ) is defined as   p k ( E ) = p k ( E , Z ) = (‚àí1) k  c 2 k ( E ‚äó C ) ‚àà H 4 k ( M , Z ),   where:   c 2 k ( E ‚äó C ) denotes the 2 k -th Chern class of the complexification  E ‚äó C = E ‚äï iE of E ,  H 4 k ( M , Z ) is the 4 k - cohomology group of M with integer coefficients.   The rational Pontryagin class p k ( E , Q ) is defined to be the image of p k ( E ) in H 4 k ( M , Q ), the 4 k -cohomology group of M with rational coefficients.  Properties  The total Pontryagin class        p   (  E  )    =   1  +    p  1    (  E  )    +    p  2    (  E  )    +  ‚ãØ   ‚àà    H  *    (  M  ,  ùêô  )     ,          p  E     1     subscript  p  1   E      subscript  p  2   E   normal-‚ãØ           superscript  H     M  ùêô       p(E)=1+p_{1}(E)+p_{2}(E)+\cdots\in H^{*}(M,\mathbf{Z}),   is (modulo 2-torsion) multiplicative with respect to Whitney sum of vector bundles, i.e.,       2  p   (   E  ‚äï  F   )    =   2  p   (  E  )    ‚å£   p   (  F  )            2  p   direct-sum  E  F      2  p  E     normal-‚å£      p  F      2p(E\oplus F)=2p(E)\smile p(F)   for two vector bundles E and F over M . In terms of the individual Pontryagin classes p k ,        2   p  1    (   E  ‚äï  F   )    =    2   p  1    (  E  )    +   2   p  1    (  F  )      ,        2   subscript  p  1    direct-sum  E  F        2   subscript  p  1   E     2   subscript  p  1   F      2p_{1}(E\oplus F)=2p_{1}(E)+2p_{1}(F),          2   p  2    (   E  ‚äï  F   )    =    2   p  2    (  E  )    +   2   p  1    (  E  )     ‚å£     p  1    (  F  )    +   2   p  2    (  F  )             2   subscript  p  2    direct-sum  E  F        2   subscript  p  2   E     2   subscript  p  1   E      normal-‚å£         subscript  p  1   F     2   subscript  p  2   F       2p_{2}(E\oplus F)=2p_{2}(E)+2p_{1}(E)\smile p_{1}(F)+2p_{2}(F)   and so on.  The vanishing of the Pontryagin classes and Stiefel-Whitney classes of a vector bundle does not guarantee that the vector bundle is trivial. For example, up to vector bundle isomorphism , there is a unique nontrivial rank 10 vector bundle E 10 over the 9-sphere . (The clutching function for E 10 arises from the stable homotopy group œÄ 8 (O(10)) = Z /2 Z .) The Pontryagin classes and Stiefel-Whitney classes all vanish: the Pontryagin classes don't exist in degree 9, and the Stiefel-Whitney class  w 9 of E 10 vanishes by the Wu formula  w 9 = w 1 w 8 + Sq 1 ( w 8 ). Moreover, this vector bundle is stably nontrivial, i.e. the Whitney sum of E 10 with any trivial bundle remains nontrivial.  Given a 2 k -dimensional vector bundle E we have         p  k    (  E  )    =   e   (  E  )    ‚å£   e   (  E  )     ,           subscript  p  k   E     e  E     normal-‚å£      e  E      p_{k}(E)=e(E)\smile e(E),   where e ( E ) denotes the Euler class of E , and   ‚å£   normal-‚å£   \smile   denotes the cup product of cohomology classes.  Pontryagin classes and curvature  As was shown by Shiing-Shen Chern and Andr√© Weil around 1948, the rational Pontryagin classes        p  k    (  E  ,  ùêê  )    ‚àà    H   4  k     (  M  ,  ùêê  )           subscript  p  k    E  ùêê       superscript  H    4  k     M  ùêê      p_{k}(E,\mathbf{Q})\in H^{4k}(M,\mathbf{Q})   can be presented as differential forms which depend polynomially on the curvature form of a vector bundle. This Chern‚ÄìWeil theory revealed a major connection between algebraic topology and global differential geometry.  For a vector bundle  E over a n -dimensional differentiable manifold  M equipped with a connection , the total Pontryagin class is expressed as       p  =   [      1  -    Tr   (   Œ©  2   )     8   œÄ  2      +     Tr    (   Œ©  2   )   2    -   2  T  r   (   Œ©  4   )      128   œÄ  4      -      Tr    (   Œ©  2   )   3    -   6  T  r   (   Œ©  2   )   Tr   (   Œ©  4   )     +   8  T  r   (   Œ©  6   )      3072   œÄ  6      +  ‚ãØ   ]   ‚àà    H   d  R   *    (  M  )     ,        p   delimited-[]          1      Tr   superscript  normal-Œ©  2      8   superscript  œÄ  2            Tr   superscript   superscript  normal-Œ©  2   2      2  normal-T  normal-r   superscript  normal-Œ©  4       128   superscript  œÄ  4              Tr   superscript   superscript  normal-Œ©  2   3      6  normal-T  normal-r   superscript  normal-Œ©  2   Tr   superscript  normal-Œ©  4       8  normal-T  normal-r   superscript  normal-Œ©  6       3072   superscript  œÄ  6      normal-‚ãØ            subscript   superscript  H      d  R    M      p=\left[1-\frac{{\rm Tr}(\Omega^{2})}{8\pi^{2}}+\frac{{\rm Tr}(\Omega^{2})^{2}%

 \right]\in H^{*}_{dR}(M),     where Œ© denotes the curvature form , and H* dR ( M ) denotes the de Rham cohomology groups.  Pontryagin classes of a manifold  The Pontryagin classes of a smooth manifold are defined to be the Pontryagin classes of its tangent bundle .  Novikov proved in 1966 that if manifolds are homeomorphic then their rational Pontryagin classes p k ( M , Q ) in H 4 k ( M , Q ) are the same.  If the dimension is at least five, there are at most finitely many different smooth manifolds with given homotopy type and Pontryagin classes.  Pontryagin numbers  Pontryagin numbers are certain topological invariants of a smooth manifold . The Pontryagin number vanishes if the dimension of manifold is not divisible by 4. It is defined in terms of the Pontryagin classes of a manifold as follows:  Given a smooth 4 n -dimensional manifold M and a collection of natural numbers   k 1 , k 2 , ..., k m such that k 1 + k 2 +...+ k m = n .   the Pontryagin number    P    k  1   ,   k  2   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   k  m       subscript  P    subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  k  m      P_{k_{1},k_{2},\dots,k_{m}}   is defined by       P    k  1   ,   k  2   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   k  m     =   p   k  1    ‚å£   p   k  2    ‚å£  ‚ãØ  ‚å£    p   k  m     (   [  M  ]   )           subscript  P    subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  k  m      subscript  p   subscript  k  1      normal-‚å£     subscript  p   subscript  k  2      normal-‚å£    normal-‚ãØ    normal-‚å£       subscript  p   subscript  k  m     delimited-[]  M       P_{k_{1},k_{2},\dots,k_{m}}=p_{k_{1}}\smile p_{k_{2}}\smile\cdots\smile p_{k_{%
 m}}([M])   where p k denotes the k -th Pontryagin class and [ M ] the fundamental class of M .  Properties   Pontryagin numbers are oriented cobordism invariant; and together with Stiefel-Whitney numbers they determine an oriented manifold's oriented cobordism class.  Pontryagin numbers of closed Riemannian manifold (as well as Pontryagin classes) can be calculated as integrals of certain polynomial from curvature tensor of Riemannian manifold.  Such invariants as signature and     A  ^     normal-^  A    \hat{A}   -genus can be expressed through Pontryagin numbers.   Generalizations  There is also a quaternionic Pontryagin class, for vector bundles with quaternion structure.
