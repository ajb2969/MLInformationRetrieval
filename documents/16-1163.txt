   Continuous-time random walk      Continuous-time random walk  In mathematics, a '''continuous-time random walk''' ('''CTRW''') is a generalization of a [[random walk]] where the wandering particle waits for a random time between jumps. It is a stochastic  jump  process with arbitrary distributions of jump lengths and waiting times. 1 2 3 More generally it can be seen to be a special case of a Markov  renewal  process .  Motivation  CTRW was introduced by Montroll and Weiss  4 as a generalization of physical diffusion process to effectively describe anomalous diffusion , i.e., the super- and sub-diffusive cases. An equivalent formulation of the CTRW is given by generalized master equations . 5 A connection between CTRWs and diffusion equations with fractional time derivatives has been established. 6 Similarly, time-space fractional diffusion equations can be considered as CTRWs with continuously distributed jumps or continuum approximations of CTRWs on lattices. 7  Formulation  A simple formulation of a CTRW is to consider the stochastic process    X   (  t  )       X  t    X(t)   defined by        X   (  t  )    =    X  0   +    ∑   i  =  1    N   (  t  )      Δ   X  i       ,        X  t      subscript  X  0     superscript   subscript     i  1      N  t      normal-Δ   subscript  X  i        X(t)=X_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{N(t)}\Delta X_{i},     whose increments    Δ   X  i       normal-Δ   subscript  X  i     \Delta X_{i}   are iid random variables taking values in a domain   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   and    N   (  t  )       N  t    N(t)   is the number of jumps in the interval    (  0  ,  t  )     0  t    (0,t)   . The probability for the process taking the value   X   X   X   at time   t   t   t   is then given by        P   (  X  ,  t  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞    P   (  n  ,  t  )    P  n    (  X  )      .        P   X  t      superscript   subscript     n  0        P   n  t    subscript  P  n   X      P(X,t)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}P(n,t)P_{n}(X).     Here     P  n    (  X  )        subscript  P  n   X    P_{n}(X)   is the probability for the process taking the value   X   X   X   after   n   n   n   jumps, and    P   (  n  ,  t  )       P   n  t     P(n,t)   is the probability of having   n   n   n   jumps after time   t   t   t   .  Montroll-Weiss formula  Denoting the waiting time distribution in between two jumps of    N   (  t  )       N  t    N(t)   by    ψ   (  τ  )       ψ  τ    \psi(\tau)   , its Laplace transform is defined by         ψ  ~    (  s  )    =    ∫  0  ∞    d  τ   e   -   τ  s     ψ   (  τ  )      .         normal-~  ψ   s     superscript   subscript   0       d  τ   superscript  e      τ  s     ψ  τ      \tilde{\psi}(s)=\int_{0}^{\infty}d\tau e^{-\tau s}\psi(\tau).     Similarly, for the jump distribution    f   (   Δ  X   )       f    normal-Δ  X     f(\Delta X)   of the increments, the Fourier transform is given by         f  ^    (  k  )    =    ∫  Ω    d   (   Δ  X   )    e   i  k  Δ  X    f   (   Δ  X   )      .         normal-^  f   k     subscript   normal-Ω     d    normal-Δ  X    superscript  e    i  k  normal-Δ  X    f    normal-Δ  X       \hat{f}(k)=\int_{\Omega}d(\Delta X)e^{ik\Delta X}f(\Delta X).     One can show that the Laplace-Fourier transform of the probability    P   (  X  ,  t  )       P   X  t     P(X,t)   is given by          P  ~   ^    (  k  ,  s  )    =     1  -    ψ  ~    (  s  )     s    1   1  -    ψ  ~    (  s  )    f  ^    (  k  )        .         normal-^   normal-~  P     k  s          1     normal-~  ψ   s    s     1    1     normal-~  ψ   s   normal-^  f   k        \hat{\tilde{P}}(k,s)=\frac{1-\tilde{\psi}(s)}{s}\frac{1}{1-\tilde{\psi}(s)\hat%
 {f}(k)}.     The above is called Montroll - Weiss formula.  Examples  The Wiener process is the standard example of a continuous time random walk in which the waiting times are exponential and the jumps are continuous and normally distributed .
