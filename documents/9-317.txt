   DSSP (hydrogen bond estimation algorithm)      DSSP (hydrogen bond estimation algorithm)   The DSSP algorithm is the standard method for assigning secondary structure to the amino acids of a protein, given the atomic-resolution coordinates of the protein. The abbreviation is only mentioned once in the 1983 paper describing this algorithm, 1 where it is the name of the Pascal program that implements the algorithm Define Secondary Structure of Proteins .  DSSP begins by identifying the intra-backbone hydrogen bonds of the protein using a purely electrostatic definition, assuming partial charges of -0.42 e and +0.20 e to the carbonyl oxygen and amide hydrogen respectively, their opposites assigned to the carbonyl carbon and amide nitrogen. A hydrogen bond is identified if E in the following equation is less than -0.5 kcal/mol:      E  =      0.084   {     1   r   O  N     +   1   r   C  H      -   1   r   O  H     -   1   r   C  N      }    ⋅   332    kcal   /  mol       E       normal-⋅    0.084         1   subscript  r    O  N       1   subscript  r    C  H        1   subscript  r    O  H       1   subscript  r    C  N        332   kcal   mol     E=0.084\left\{\frac{1}{r_{ON}}+\frac{1}{r_{CH}}-\frac{1}{r_{OH}}-\frac{1}{r_{%
 CN}}\right\}\cdot 332\,\mathrm{kcal/mol}     Based on this, eight types of secondary structure are assigned. The 3 10 helix , α helix and π helix have symbols G , H and I and are recognized by having a repetitive sequence of hydrogen bonds in which the residues are three, four, or five residues apart respectively. Two types of beta sheet structures exist; a beta bridge has symbol B while longer sets of hydrogen bonds and beta bulges have symbol E . T is used for turns, featuring hydrogen bonds typical of helices, S is used for regions of high curvature (where the angle between      C  i  α    C   i  +  2   α    →     normal-→     superscript   subscript  C  i   α    superscript   subscript  C    i  2    α      \overrightarrow{C_{i}^{\alpha}C_{i+2}^{\alpha}}   and      C   i  -  2   α    C  i  α    →     normal-→     superscript   subscript  C    i  2    α    superscript   subscript  C  i   α      \overrightarrow{C_{i-2}^{\alpha}C_{i}^{\alpha}}   is less than 70°), and a blank (or space) is used if no other rule applies, referring to loops. 2 These eight types are usually grouped into three larger classes: helix ( G , H and I ), strand ( E and B ) and loop (all others).  In 2002, a continuous DSSP assignment was developed by introducing multiple hydrogen bond thresholds, where the new assignment was found to correlate with protein motion. 3  References  See also   STRIDE (protein) an alternative algorithm  Chris Sander (Scientist)   External links   DSSP Analysis tool  Continuous DSSP tool   "  Category:Protein structure     ↩  " DSSP manual " ↩  ↩
