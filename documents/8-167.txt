Information algebra

The term "information algebra" refers to mathematical techniques of information processing. Classical information theory goes back to Claude Shannon. It is a theory of information transmission, looking at communication and storage. However, it has not been considered so far that information comes from different sources and that it is therefore usually combined. It has furthermore been neglected in classical information theory that one wants to extract those parts out of a piece of information that are relevant to specific questions.
A mathematical phrasing of these operations leads to an algebra of information, describing basic modes of information processing. Such an algebra involves several formalisms of computer science, which seem to be different on the surface: relational databases, multiple systems of formal logic or numerical problems of linear algebra. It allows the development of generic procedures of information processing and thus a unification of basic methods of computer science, in particular of distributed information processing.
Information relates to precise questions, comes from different sources, must be aggregated, and can be focused on questions of interest. Starting from these considerations, information algebras  are two-sorted algebras 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a semigroup, representing combination or aggregation of information, 
 
 
 
  is a lattice of domains (related to questions) whose partial order reflects the granularity of the domain or the question, and a mixed operation representing focusing or extraction of information.
Information and its operations
More precisely, in the two-sorted algebra 
 
 
 
 , the following operations are defined




Combination 
 
 

 Focusing 
 
 



            



Additionally, in 
 
 
 
  the usual lattice operations (meet and join) are defined.
Axioms and definition
The axioms of the two-sorted algebra 
 
 
 
 , in addition to the axioms of the lattice 
 
 
 
 :




Semigroup 
 
 
 
  is a commutative semigroup under combination with a neutral element (representing vacuous information).
 Distributivity of Focusing over Combination 
 
 


To focus an information on 
 
 
 
  combined with another information to domain 
 
 
 
 , one may as well first focus the second information to 
 
 
 
  and combine then.

Transitivity of Focusing 
 
 


To focus an information on 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , one may focus it to 
 
 
 
 .

Idempotency 
 
 


An information combined with a part of itself gives nothing new.

Support 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 


Each information refers to at least one domain (question).

            



A two-sorted algebra 
 
 
 
  satisfying these axioms is called an Information Algebra.
Order of information
A partial order of information can be introduced by defining 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 . This means that 
 
 
 
  is less informative than 
 
 
 
  if it adds no new information to 
 
 
 
 . The semigroup 
 
 
 
  is a semilattice relative to this order, i.e. 
 
 
 
 . Relative to any domain (question) 
 
 
 
  a partial order can be introduced by defining 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 . It represents the order of information content of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  relative to the domain (question) 
 
 
 
 .
Labeled information algebra
The pairs 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  form a labeled Information Algebra. More precisely, in the two-sorted algebra 
 
 
 
 , the following operations are defined




Labeling 
 
 

 Combination 
 
 

 Projection 
 
 



            



Models of information algebras
Here follows an incomplete list of instances of information algebras:

Relational algebra: The reduct of a relational algebra with natural join as combination and the usual projection is a labeled information algebra, see Example.
Constraint systems: Constraints form an information algebra .
Semiring valued algebras: C-Semirings induce information algebras ;;.
Logic: Many logic systems induce information algebras . Reducts of cylindric algebras  or polyadic algebras are information algebras related to predicate logic .
Module algebras: ;.
Linear systems: Systems of linear equations or linear inequalities induce information algebras .

Worked-out example: relational algebra
Let 
 
 
 
  be a set of symbols, called attributes (or column names). For each 
 
 
 
  let 
 
 
 
  be a non-empty set, the set of all possible values of the attribute 
 
 
 
 . For example, if 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  could be the set of strings, whereas 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are both the set of non-negative integers.
Let 
 
 
 
 . An 

 
 -tuple is a function 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for each 
 
 
 
  The set of all 
 
 
 
 -tuples is denoted by 
 
 
 
 . For an 
 
 
 
 -tuple 
 
 
 
  and a subset 
 
 
 
  the restriction 
 
 
 
  is defined to be the 
 
 
 
 -tuple 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
A relation 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 is a set of 
 
 
 
 -tuples, i.e. a subset of 
 
 
 
 . The set of attributes 
 
 
 
  is called the domain of 
 
 
 
  and denoted by 
 
 
 
 . For 
 
 
 
  the projection of 
 
 
 
  onto 
 
 
 
  is defined as follows:


 
  The join of a relation 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  and a relation 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  is defined as follows:


 
  As an example, let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be the following relations:


 
  Then the join of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is:


 
  A relational database with natural join 
 
 
 
  as combination and the usual projection 
 
 
 
  is an information algebra. The operations are well defined since




If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .

It is easy to see that relational databases satisfy the axioms of a labeled information algebra:

semigroup 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

 transitivity : If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .
 combination : If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .
 idempotency : If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .
 support : If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .

Historical Roots
The axioms for information algebras are derived from the axiom system proposed in (Shenoy and Shafer, 1990), see also (Shafer, 1991).
