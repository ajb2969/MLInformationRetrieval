Connection (fibred manifold)

In differential geometry, a fibered manifold is surjective submersion of smooth manifolds

 
 . Locally trivial fibered manifolds are fiber bundles. Therefore, a notion of connection on fibered manifolds provides a general framework of a connection on fiber bundles.
Formal definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a fibered manifold. A (generalized) connection on 
 
 
 
  is a section

 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the jet manifold of 
 
 
 
 .1
Connection as a horizontal splitting
Let 
 
 
 
  be a fibered manifold. There is the following canonical short exact sequence of vector bundles over 
 
 
 
 :



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the tangent bundles of 
 
 
 
 , respectively, 
 
 
 
  is the vertical tangent bundle of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the pullback bundle of 
 
 
 
  onto 
 
 
 
 .
A connection on a fibered manifold 
 
 
 
  is defined as a linear bundle morphism



over 
 
 
 
  which splits the exact sequence (1). A connection always exists.
Sometimes, this connection 
 
 
 
  is called the Ehresmann connection because it yields the horizontal distribution



of 
 
 
 
  and its horizontal decomposition

 
 .
At the same time, by an Ehresmann connection also is meant the following construction. Any connection 
 
 
 
  on a fibered manifold 
 
 
 
  yields a horizontal lift 
 
 
 
  of a vector field

 
  on 
 
 
 
  onto 
 
 
 
 , but need not defines the similar lift of a path in 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be smooth paths in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively. Then 
 
 
 
  is called the horizontal lift of 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . A connection 
 
 
 
  is said to be the Ehresmann connection if, for each path 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , there exists its horizontal lift trough any point 
 
 
 
 . A fibered manifold is a fiber bundle if and only if it admits such an Ehresmann connection.
Connection as a tangent-valued form
Given a fibered manifold 
 
 
 
 , let it be endowed with an atlas of fibered coordinates 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be a connection on 
 
 
 
 . It yields uniquely the horizontal tangent-valued one-form



on 
 
 
 
  which projects onto the canonical tangent-valued form (tautological one-form) 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , and vice versa. With this form, the horizontal splitting (2) reads



In particular, the connection 
 
 
 
  (3) yields the horizontal lift of any vector field 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  to a projectable vector field



on 
 
 
 
 .
Connection as a vertical-valued form
The horizontal splitting (2) of the exact sequence (1) defines the corresponding splitting of the dual exact sequence



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the cotangent bundles of 
 
 
 
 , respectively, and 
 
 
 
  is the dual bundle to 
 
 
 
 , called the vertical cotangent bundle. This splitting is given by the vertical-valued form



which also represents a connection on a fibered manifold.
Treating a connection as a vertical-valued form, one comes to the following important construction. Given a fibered manifold 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be a morphism and 
 
 
 
  the pullback bundle of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . Then any connection 
 
 
 
  (3) on 
 
 
 
  induces the pullback connection



on 
 
 
 
 .
Connection as a jet bundle section
Let 
 
 
 
  be the jet manifold of sections of a fibered manifold 
 
 
 
 , with coordinates 
 
 
 
 . Due to the canonical imbedding



any connection 
 
 
 
  (3) on a fibered manifold 
 
 
 
  is represented by a global section



of the jet bundle 
 
 
 
 , and vice versa. It is an affine bundle modelled on a vector bundle



There are the following corollaries of this fact.
(i) Connections on a fibered manifold 
 
 
 
  make up an affine space modelled on the vector space of soldering forms



on 
 
 
 
 , i.e., sections of the vector bundle (4).
(ii) Connection coefficients possess the coordinate transformation law



(iii) Every connection 
 
 
 
 
  on a fibred manifold 
 
 
 
  yields the first order differential operator



on 
 
 
 
  called the covariant differential relative to the connection 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is a section, its covariant differential



and the covariant derivative

 
  along a vector field 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  are defined.
Curvature and torsion
Given the connection 
 
 
 
  (3) on a fibered manifold 
 
 
 
 , its curvature is defined as the Nijenhuis differential






This is a vertical-valued horizontal two-form on 
 
 
 
 .
Given the connection 
 
 
 
  (3) and the soldering form 
 
 
 
  (5), a torsion of 
 
 
 
  with respect to 
 
 
 
  is defined as



Bundle of principal connections
Let 
 
 
 
  be a principal bundle with a structure Lie group 
 
 
 
 . A principal connection on 
 
 
 
  usually is described by a Lie algebra-valued connection one-form on 
 
 
 
 . At the same time, a principal connection on 
 
 
 
  is a global section of the jet bundle 
 
 
 
  which is equivariant with respect to the canonical right action of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, it is represented by a global section of the quotient bundle 
 
 
 
 , called the bundle of principal connections. It is an affine bundle modelled on the vector bundle 
 
 
 
  whose typical fiber is the Lie algebra

 
  of structure group 
 
 
 
 , and where 
 
 
 
  acts on by the adjoint representation. There is the canonical imbedding of 
 
 
 
  to the quotient bundle 
 
 
 
  which also is called the bundle of principal connections.
Given a basis 
 
 
 
  for a Lie algebra of 
 
 
 
 , the fiber bundle 
 
 
 
  is endowed with bundle coordinates 
 
 
 
 , and its sections are represented by vector-valued one-forms



where 
 
 
 
  are the familiar local connection forms on 
 
 
 
 .
Let us note that the jet bundle 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is a configuration space of Yang–Mills gauge theory. It admits the canonical decomposition



where



is called the strength form of a principal connection.
