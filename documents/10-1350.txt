Nitrogenase (flavodoxin)

Nitrogenase (flavodoxin) () is an enzyme with system name reduced flavodoxin:dinitrogen oxidoreductase (ATP-hydrolysing).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

6 reduced flavodoxin + 6 H+ + N2 + n ATP 
 
 
 
  6 oxidized flavodoxin + 2 NH3 + n ADP + n phosphate


The enzyme is a complex of two proteins containing iron-sulfur centres and molybdenum.
