   2-hydroxyquinoline 8-monooxygenase      2-hydroxyquinoline 8-monooxygenase   In enzymology , a 2-hydroxyquinoline 8-monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   quinolin-2-ol + NADH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   quinolin-2,8-diol + NAD + + H 2 O   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are quinolin-2-ol , NADH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are quinolin-2,8-diol , NAD + , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is quinolin-2(1H)-one,NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase (8-oxygenating) . This enzyme is also called 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase . It employs one cofactor , iron .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
