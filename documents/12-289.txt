   Hill differential equation      Hill differential equation    This article is about the Hill differential equation; for the equation used in biochemistry see Hill equation (biochemistry)    In mathematics , the Hill equation or Hill differential equation is the second-order linear ordinary differential equation           d  2   y    d   t  2     +   f   (  t  )   y    =  0   ,             superscript  d  2   y     d   superscript  t  2       f  t  y    0    \frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}+f(t)y=0,   where f(t) is a periodic function . 1 It is named after George William Hill , who introduced it in 1886. 2  One can always assume that the period of f ( t ) equals π ; then the Hill equation can be rewritten using the Fourier series of f ( t ):          d  2   y    d   t  2     +    (    θ  0   +   2    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     θ  n    cos   (   2  n  t   )       +    ∑   m  =  1   ∞     ϕ  m    sin   (   2  m  t   )       )   y    =  0.             superscript  d  2   y     d   superscript  t  2          subscript  θ  0     2    superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  θ  n       2  n  t         superscript   subscript     m  1         subscript  ϕ  m       2  m  t       y    0.    \frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}+\left(\theta_{0}+2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\theta_{n}\cos(2nt)%
 +\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\phi_{m}\sin(2mt)\right)y=0.     Important special cases of Hill's equation include the Mathieu equation (in which only the terms corresponding to n = 0, 1 are included) and the Meissner equation .  Hill's equation is an important example in the understanding of periodic differential equations. Depending on the exact shape of f ( t ), solutions may stay bounded for all time, or the amplitude of the oscillations in solutions may grow exponentially. 3 The precise form of the solutions to Hill's equation is described by Floquet theory . Solutions can also be written in terms of Hill determinants.  Aside from its original application to lunar stability, the Hill equation appears in many settings including the modeling of a quadrupole mass spectrometer , as the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation of an electron in a crystal and in accelerator physics .
