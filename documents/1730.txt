   Bony–Brezis theorem      Bony–Brezis theorem   In mathematics , the Bony–Brezis theorem , due to the French mathematicians Jean-Michel Bony and Haïm Brezis , gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a closed subset of a manifold to be invariant under the flow defined by a vector field , namely at each point of the closed set the vector field must have non-positive inner product with any exterior normal vector to the set. A vector is an exterior normal at a point of the closed set if there is a real-valued continuously differentiable function maximized locally at the point with that vector as its derivative at the point. If the closed subset is a smooth submanifold with boundary, the condition states that the vector field should not point outside the subset at boundary points. The generalization to non-smooth subsets is important in the theory of partial differential equations .  The theorem had in fact been previously discovered by Mitio Nagumo in 1942 and is also known as the Nagumo theorem.  Statement  Let F be closed subset of a C 2 manifold M and let X be a vector field on M which is Lipschitz continuous . The following conditions are equivalent:   Any integral curve of X starting in F remains in F .  ( X ( m ), v ) ≤ 0 for any exterior normal vector v at a point m in F .   Proof  Following , to prove that the first condition implies the second, let c ( t ) be an integral curve with c (0) = x in F and dc/dt = X ( c ). Let g have a local maximum on F at x . Then g ( c ( t )) ≤ g ( c (0)) for t small and positive. Differentiating, this implies that g '( x )⋅ X ( x ) ≤ 0.  To prove the reverse implication, since the result is local. it enough to check it in R n . In that case X locally satisfies a Lipschitz condition        |    X   (  a  )    -   X   (  b  )     |   ≤   C   |   a  -  b   |     .            X  a     X  b       C      a  b       \displaystyle{|X(a)-X(b)|\leq C|a-b|.}     If F is closed, the distance function D ( x ) = d ( x , F ) 2 has the following differentiability property:        D   (   x  +  h   )    =    D   (  x  )    +     min  z    2  h    ⋅   (   x  -  z   )    +   o   (   |  h  |   )      ,        D    x  h        D  x    normal-⋅    subscript   z     2  h      x  z      o    h       \displaystyle{D(x+h)=D(x)+\min_{z}2h\cdot(x-z)+o(|h|),}     where the minimum is taken over the closest points z to x in F .   To check this, let            f  ε    (  h  )    =     min  z    2  h    ⋅   (   x  -  z   )     ,         subscript  f  ε   h    normal-⋅    subscript   z     2  h      x  z      \displaystyle{f_{\varepsilon}(h)=\min_{z}2h\cdot(x-z),}         where the minimum is taken over z in F such that d ( x , z ) ≤ d ( x , F ) + ε.    Since f ε is homogeneous in h and increases uniformly to f 0 on any sphere,            f  0    (  h  )    ≥    f  ε    (  h  )    ≥     f  0    (  h  )    -   C   (  ε  )    |  h  |      ,           subscript  f  0   h      subscript  f  ε   h             subscript  f  0   h     C  ε    h        \displaystyle{f_{0}(h)\geq f_{\varepsilon}(h)\geq f_{0}(h)-C(\varepsilon)|h|,}         with a constant C (ε) tending to 0 as ε tends to 0.    This differentiability property follows from this because          D   (   x  +  h   )    ≤    |    x  +  h   -  z   |   2   ≤     |   z  -  x   |   2   +    2  h   ⋅   (   x  -  z   )    +    |  h  |   2    =    D   (  x  )    +    f  0    (  h  )    +    |  h  |   2            D    x  h     superscript        x  h   z    2           superscript      z  x    2    normal-⋅    2  h     x  z     superscript    h   2             D  x      subscript  f  0   h    superscript    h   2       \displaystyle{D(x+h)\leq|x+h-z|^{2}\leq|z-x|^{2}+2h\cdot(x-z)+|h|^{2}=D(x)+f_{%
 0}(h)+|h|^{2}}         and similarly if | h | ≤ ε           D   (   x  +  h   )    ≥    D   (  x  )    +    f  ε    (  h  )    +    |  h  |   2     .        D    x  h        D  x      subscript  f  ε   h    superscript    h   2      \displaystyle{D(x+h)\geq D(x)+f_{\varepsilon}(h)+|h|^{2}.}        The differentiability property implies that        lim  δ   ↓   0     D   (   c   (   t  +  δ   )    )    -   D   (   c   (  t  )    )     δ    =    2    min  z   X    (   c   (  t  )    )    ⋅   (    c   (  t  )    -  z   )     ,       normal-↓    δ     0        D    c    t  δ       D    c  t     δ          normal-⋅    2    subscript   z   X     c  t        c  t   z       \displaystyle{\lim{\delta\downarrow 0}{D(c(t+\delta))-D(c(t))\over\delta}=2%

For any such z         2  X   (   c   (  t  )    )    ⋅   (    c   (  t  )    -  z   )    =     2  X   (  z  )    ⋅   (    c   (  t  )    -  z   )    -    2   (    X   (  z  )    -   X   (   c   (  t  )    )     )    ⋅   (    c   (  t  )    -  z   )      .       normal-⋅    2  X    c  t        c  t   z       normal-⋅    2  X  z       c  t   z     normal-⋅    2      X  z     X    c  t          c  t   z       \displaystyle{2X(c(t))\cdot(c(t)-z)=2X(z)\cdot(c(t)-z)-2(X(z)-X(c(t)))\cdot(c(%
 t)-z).}     Since −| y − c ( t )| 2 has a local maximum on F at y = z , c ( t ) − z is an exterior normal vector at z . So the first term on the right hand side is non-negative. The Lipschitz condition for X implies the second term is bounded above by 2 C ⋅ D ( c ( t )). Thus the derivative from the right of       e   -   2  C  t     D   (   c   (  t  )    )        superscript  e      2  C  t     D    c  t     \displaystyle{e^{-2Ct}D(c(t))}     is non-positive, so it is a non-increasing function of t . Thus if c (0) lies in F , D ( c (0))=0 and hence D ( c ( t )) = 0 for t > 0, i.e. c ( t ) lies in F for t > 0.
