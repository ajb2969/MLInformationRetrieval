   LF-space      LF-space   In mathematics , an LF -space is a topological vector space  V that is a locally convex inductive limit of a countable inductive system    (   V  n   ,   i   n  m    )      subscript  V  n    subscript  i    n  m      (V_{n},i_{nm})   of Fréchet spaces . This means that V is a direct limit of the system    (   V  n   ,   i   n  m    )      subscript  V  n    subscript  i    n  m      (V_{n},i_{nm})   in the category of locally convex topological vector spaces and each    V  n     subscript  V  n    V_{n}   is a Fréchet space.  Some authors restrict the term LF -space to mean that V is a strict locally convex inductive limit, which means that the topology induced on    V  n     subscript  V  n    V_{n}   by    V   n  +  1      subscript  V    n  1     V_{n+1}   is identical to the original topology on    V  n     subscript  V  n    V_{n}   . 1  The topology on V can be described by specifying that an absolutely convex subset U is a neighborhood of 0 if and only if    U  ∩   V  n       U   subscript  V  n     U\cap V_{n}   is an absolutely convex neighborhood of 0 in    V  n     subscript  V  n    V_{n}   for every n.  Properties  An LF -space is barrelled and bornological (and thus ultrabornological ).  Examples  A typical example of an LF -space is,     C  c  ∞    (   ℝ  n   )        subscript   superscript  C    c    superscript  ℝ  n     C^{\infty}_{c}(\mathbb{R}^{n})   , the space of all infinitely differentiable functions on    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   with compact support. The LF -space structure is obtained by considering a sequence of compact sets     K  1   ⊂   K  2   ⊂  …  ⊂   K  i   ⊂  …  ⊂   ℝ  n          subscript  K  1    subscript  K  2        normal-…        subscript  K  i        normal-…        superscript  ℝ  n      K_{1}\subset K_{2}\subset\ldots\subset K_{i}\subset\ldots\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}   with      ⋃  i    K  i    =   ℝ  n         subscript   i    subscript  K  i     superscript  ℝ  n     \bigcup_{i}K_{i}=\mathbb{R}^{n}   and for all i,    K  i     subscript  K  i    K_{i}   is a subset of the interior of    K   i  +  1      subscript  K    i  1     K_{i+1}   . Such a sequence could be the balls of radius i centered at the origin. The space     C  c  ∞    (   K  i   )        superscript   subscript  C  c      subscript  K  i     C_{c}^{\infty}(K_{i})   of infinitely differentiable functions on    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   with compact support contained in    K  i     subscript  K  i    K_{i}   has a natural Fréchet space structure and     C  c  ∞    (   ℝ  n   )        subscript   superscript  C    c    superscript  ℝ  n     C^{\infty}_{c}(\mathbb{R}^{n})   inherits its LF -space structure as described above. The LF -space topology does not depend on the particular sequence of compact sets    K  i     subscript  K  i    K_{i}   .  With this LF -space structure,     C  c  ∞    (   ℝ  n   )        subscript   superscript  C    c    superscript  ℝ  n     C^{\infty}_{c}(\mathbb{R}^{n})   is known as the space of test functions, of fundamental importance in the theory of distributions .
