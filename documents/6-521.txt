LF-space

In mathematics, an LF-space is a topological vector space V that is a locally convex inductive limit of a countable inductive system 
 
 
 
  of Fréchet spaces. This means that V is a direct limit of the system 
 
 
 
  in the category of locally convex topological vector spaces and each 
 
 
 
  is a Fréchet space.
Some authors restrict the term LF-space to mean that V is a strict locally convex inductive limit, which means that the topology induced on 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  is identical to the original topology on 
 
 
 
 .1
The topology on V can be described by specifying that an absolutely convex subset U is a neighborhood of 0 if and only if 
 
 
 
  is an absolutely convex neighborhood of 0 in 
 
 
 
  for every n.
Properties
An LF-space is barrelled and bornological (and thus ultrabornological).
Examples
A typical example of an LF-space is, 
 
 
 
 , the space of all infinitely differentiable functions on 
 
 
 
  with compact support. The LF-space structure is obtained by considering a sequence of compact sets 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and for all i, 
 
 
 
  is a subset of the interior of 
 
 
 
 . Such a sequence could be the balls of radius i centered at the origin. The space 
 
 
 
  of infinitely differentiable functions on 
 
 
 
 with compact support contained in 
 
 
 
  has a natural Fréchet space structure and 
 
 
 
  inherits its LF-space structure as described above. The LF-space topology does not depend on the particular sequence of compact sets 
 
 
 
 .
With this LF-space structure, 
 
 
 
  is known as the space of test functions, of fundamental importance in the theory of distributions.
