Arithmetico-geometric sequence

In mathematics, an arithmetico-geometric sequence is the result of the multiplication of a geometric progression with the corresponding terms of an arithmetic progression.
Sequence, nth term
The sequence has the nth term1 defined for n ≥ 1 as:



are terms from the arithmetic progression with difference d and initial value a.
Series, sum to n terms
An arithmetico-geometric series has the form



and the sum to n terms is equal to:



Derivation
Starting from the series,2



multiply Sn by r,



subtract rSn from Sn,



using the expression for the sum of a geometric series in the middle series of terms. Finally dividing through by (1 − r) gives the result.
Sum to infinite terms
If −1 



If r is outside of the above range, the series either

diverges (when r > 1, or when r = 1 where the series is arithmetic and a and d are not both zero; if both a and d are zero in the later case, all terms of the series are zero and the series is constant)
or alternates (when r ≤ −1).
