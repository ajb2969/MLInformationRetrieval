Equioscillation theorem

The equioscillation theorem concerns the approximation of continuous functions using polynomials when the merit function is the maximum difference (uniform norm). Its discovery is attributed to Chebyshev.
Statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be a continuous function from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . Among all the polynomials of degree 
 
 
 
 , the polynomial 
 
 
 
  minimizes the uniform norm of the difference 
 
 
 
  if and only if there are 
 
 
 
  points 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 .
Algorithms
Several minimax approximation algorithms are available, the most common being the Remez algorithm.
