   Equioscillation theorem      Equioscillation theorem   The equioscillation theorem concerns the approximation of continuous functions using polynomials when the merit function is the maximum difference ( uniform norm ). Its discovery is attributed to Chebyshev .  Statement  Let   f   f   f   be a continuous function from    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   to   ùêë   ùêë   \mathbf{R}   . Among all the polynomials of degree     ‚â§  n      absent  n    \leq n   , the polynomial   g   g   g   minimizes the uniform norm of the difference     ||   f  -  g   ||   ‚àû     subscript   norm    f  g       ||f-g||_{\infty}   if and only if there are    n  +  2      n  2    n+2   points    a  ‚â§   x  0   <   x  1   <  ‚ãØ  <   x   n  +  1    ‚â§  b        a   subscript  x  0         subscript  x  1        normal-‚ãØ        subscript  x    n  1         b     a\leq x_{0}   such that      f   (   x  i   )    -   g   (   x  i   )     =   œÉ    (   -  1   )   i     ||   f  -  g   ||   ‚àû            f   subscript  x  i      g   subscript  x  i       œÉ   superscript    1   i    subscript   norm    f  g         f(x_{i})-g(x_{i})=\sigma(-1)^{i}||f-g||_{\infty}   where    œÉ  =   ¬±  1       œÉ   plus-or-minus  1     \sigma=\pm 1   .  Algorithms  Several minimax approximation algorithms are available, the most common being the Remez algorithm .
