   Łukasiewicz logic      Łukasiewicz logic  In [[mathematics]], '''Łukasiewicz logic''' ({{IPAc-en|l|uː|k|ə|ˈ|ʃ|ɛ|v|ɪ|tʃ}}; {{IPA-pl|wukaˈɕɛvʲitʂ}}) is a [[non-classical logic|non-classical]], [[many-valued logic|many valued]] logic. It was originally defined in the early 20th-century by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] as a [[three-valued logic]]; Łukasiewicz J., 1920, O logice trójwartościowej (in Polish). Ruch filozoficz ny 5 :170–171. English translation: On three-valued logic, in L. Borkowski (ed.), Selected works by Jan Łukasiewicz , North–Holland, Amsterdam, 1970, pp. 87–88. ISBN 0-7204-2252-3 it was later generalized to n -valued (for all finite n ) as well as infinitely-many-valued (ℵ 0 -valued) variants, both propositional and first-order. 1 The ℵ 0 -valued version was published in 1930 by Łukasiewicz and Alfred Tarski ; consequently it is sometimes called the Łukasiewicz-Tarski logic . 2 It belongs to the classes of t-norm fuzzy logics 3 and substructural logics . 4  This article presents the Łukasiewicz[-Tarski] logic in its full generality, i.e. as an infinite-valued logic. For an elementary introduction to the three-valued instantiation Ł 3 , see three-valued logic .  Language  The propositional connectives of Łukasiewicz logic are implication    →   normal-→   \rightarrow   , negation    ¬     \neg   , equivalence    ↔   normal-↔   \leftrightarrow   , weak conjunction    ∧     \wedge   , strong conjunction    ⊗   tensor-product   \otimes   , weak disjunction    ∨     \vee   , strong disjunction    ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus   , and propositional constants    0  ¯     normal-¯  0    \overline{0}   and    1  ¯     normal-¯  1    \overline{1}   . The presence of conjunction and disjunction is a common feature of substructural logics without the rule of contraction, to which Łukasiewicz logic belongs.  Axioms  The original system of axioms for propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic used implication and negation as the primitive connectives:      A  →   (  B  →  A  )      fragments  A  normal-→   fragments  normal-(  B  normal-→  A  normal-)     A\rightarrow(B\rightarrow A)          (  A  →  B  )   →   (   (  B  →  C  )   →   (  A  →  C  )   )      fragments   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-→  B  normal-)   normal-→   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(  B  normal-→  C  normal-)   normal-→   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-→  C  normal-)   normal-)     (A\rightarrow B)\rightarrow((B\rightarrow C)\rightarrow(A\rightarrow C))          (   (  A  →  B  )   →  B  )   →   (   (  B  →  A  )   →  A  )      fragments   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-→  B  normal-)   normal-→  B  normal-)   normal-→   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(  B  normal-→  A  normal-)   normal-→  A  normal-)     ((A\rightarrow B)\rightarrow B)\rightarrow((B\rightarrow A)\rightarrow A)          (  ¬  B  →  ¬  A  )   →   (  A  →  B  )   .     fragments   fragments  normal-(   B  normal-→   A  normal-)   normal-→   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-→  B  normal-)   normal-.    (\neg B\rightarrow\neg A)\rightarrow(A\rightarrow B).     Propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic can also be axiomatized by adding the following axioms to the axiomatic system of monoidal t-norm logic :   Divisibility:      (  A  ∧  B  )   →   (  A  ⊗   (  A  →  B  )   )      fragments   fragments  normal-(  A   B  normal-)   normal-→   fragments  normal-(  A  tensor-product   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-→  B  normal-)   normal-)     (A\wedge B)\rightarrow(A\otimes(A\rightarrow B))     Double negation:       ¬  ¬  A   →  A   .     normal-→      A   A    \neg\neg A\rightarrow A.      That is, infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic arises by adding the axiom of double negation to basic t-norm logic BL , or by adding the axiom of divisibility to the logic IMTL.  Finite-valued Łukasiewicz logics require additional axioms.  Real-valued semantics  Infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic is a real-valued logic in which sentences from sentential calculus may be assigned a truth value of not only zero or one but also any real number in between (e.g. 0.25). Valuations have a recursive definition where:        w   (   θ  ∘  ϕ   )    =    F  ∘    (   w   (  θ  )    ,   w   (  ϕ  )    )          w    θ  ϕ       subscript  F       w  θ     w  ϕ       w(\theta\circ\phi)=F_{\circ}(w(\theta),w(\phi))   for a binary connective    ∘  ,      \circ,           w   (   ¬  θ   )    =    F  ¬    (   w   (  θ  )    )     ,        w     θ       subscript  F      w  θ      w(\neg\theta)=F_{\neg}(w(\theta)),          w   (   0  ¯   )    =  0        w   normal-¯  0    0    w(\overline{0})=0   and      w   (   1  ¯   )    =  1   ,        w   normal-¯  1    1    w(\overline{1})=1,      and where the definitions of the operations hold as follows:   Implication:       F  →    (  x  ,  y  )    =   min   {  1  ,    1  -  x   +  y   }           subscript  F  normal-→    x  y      1      1  x   y      F_{\rightarrow}(x,y)=\min\{1,1-x+y\}     Equivalence:       F  ↔    (  x  ,  y  )    =   1  -   |   x  -  y   |           subscript  F  normal-↔    x  y      1      x  y       F_{\leftrightarrow}(x,y)=1-|x-y|     Negation:       F  ¬    (  x  )    =   1  -  x          subscript  F    x     1  x     F_{\neg}(x)=1-x     Weak Conjunction:       F  ∧    (  x  ,  y  )    =   min   {  x  ,  y  }           subscript  F     x  y      x  y     F_{\wedge}(x,y)=\min\{x,y\}     Weak Disjunction:       F  ∨    (  x  ,  y  )    =   max   {  x  ,  y  }           subscript  F     x  y      x  y     F_{\vee}(x,y)=\max\{x,y\}     Strong Conjunction:       F  ⊗    (  x  ,  y  )    =   max   {  0  ,    x  +  y   -  1   }           subscript  F  tensor-product    x  y      0      x  y   1      F_{\otimes}(x,y)=\max\{0,x+y-1\}     Strong Disjunction:        F  ⊕    (  x  ,  y  )    =   min   {  1  ,   x  +  y   }     .         subscript  F  direct-sum    x  y      1    x  y      F_{\oplus}(x,y)=\min\{1,x+y\}.      The truth function    F  ⊗     subscript  F  tensor-product    F_{\otimes}   of strong conjunction is the Łukasiewicz t-norm and the truth function    F  ⊕     subscript  F  direct-sum    F_{\oplus}   of strong disjunction is its dual t-conorm . The truth function    F  →     subscript  F  normal-→    F_{\rightarrow}   is the residuum of the Łukasiewicz t-norm. All truth functions of the basic connectives are continuous.  By definition, a formula is a tautology of infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic if it evaluates to 1 under any valuation of propositional variables by real numbers in the interval [0, 1].  Finite-valued and countable-valued semantics  Using exactly the same valuation formulas as for real-valued semantics Łukasiewicz (1922) also defined (up to isomorphism) semantics over   any finite set of cardinality n ≥ 2 by choosing the domain as }  any countable set by choosing the domain as { p / q | 0 ≤ p ≤ q where p is a non-negative integer and q is a positive integer }.   General algebraic semantics  The standard real-valued semantics determined by the Łukasiewicz t-norm is not the only possible semantics of Łukasiewicz logic. General algebraic semantics of propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic is formed by the class of all MV-algebras . The standard real-valued semantics is a special MV-algebra, called the standard MV-algebra .  Like other t-norm fuzzy logics , propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic enjoys completeness with respect to the class of all algebras for which the logic is sound (that is, MV-algebras) as well as with respect to only linear ones. This is expressed by the general, linear, and standard completeness theorems: 5   The following conditions are equivalent:     A   A   A   is provable in propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic     A   A   A   is valid in all MV-algebras ( general completeness )     A   A   A   is valid in all linearly ordered MV-algebras ( linear completeness )     A   A   A   is valid in the standard MV-algebra ( standard completeness ).     Font, Rodriguez and Torrens introduced in 1984 the Wajsberg algebra as an alternative model for the infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic. 6  A 1940s attempt by Grigore Moisil to provide algebraic semantics for the n -valued Łukasiewicz logic by means of his Łukasiewicz–Moisil (LM) algebra (which Moisil called Łukasiewicz algebras ) turned out to be an incorrect model for n ≥ 5. This issue was made public by Alan Rose in 1956. C. C. Chang 's MV-algebra, which is a model for the ℵ 0 -valued (infinitely-many-valued) Łukasiewicz-Tarski logic, was published in 1958. For the axiomatically more complicated (finite) n -valued Łukasiewicz logics, suitable algebras were published in 1977 by Revaz Grigolia and called MV n -algebras. 7 MV n -algebras are a subclass of LM n -algebras, and the inclusion is strict for n ≥ 5. 8 In 1982 Roberto Cignoli published some additional constraints that added to LM n -algebras produce proper models for n -valued Łukasiewicz logic; Cignoli called his discovery proper Łukasiewicz algebras . 9  References    Further reading   Rose, A.: 1956, Formalisation du Calcul Propositionnel Implicatif ℵ 0 Valeurs de Łukasiewicz, C.
