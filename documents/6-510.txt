Lehmer number

In mathematics, a Lehmer number is a generalization of a Lucas sequence.
Algebraic relations
If a and b are complex numbers with






under the following conditions:

Q and R are relatively prime nonzero integers


 
  is not a root of unity.

Then, the corresponding Lehmer numbers are:



for n odd, and


 
  for n even.
Their companion numbers are:



for n odd and



for n even.
Recurrence
Lehmer numbers form a linear recurrence relation with


 
  with initial values 
 
 
 
 
 . Similarly the companions sequence satisfies


 
  with initial values
