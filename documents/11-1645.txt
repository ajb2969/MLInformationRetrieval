Viomycin kinase




Viomycin kinase

In enzymology, viomycin kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + viomycin 
 
 
 
  ADP + O-phosphoviomycin
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and viomycin, whereas its two products are ADP and O-phosphoviomycin.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:viomycin O-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include viomycin phosphotransferase, and capreomycin phosphotransferase.
