Conservation form

Conservation form or Eulerian form refers to an arrangement of an equation or system of equations, usually representing an hyperbolic system, that emphasizes that a property represented is conserved, i.e. a type of continuity equation. The term is usually used in the context of continuum mechanics.
General form
Equations in conservation form take the form


 
  for any conserved quantity 
 
 
 
 , with a suitable function 
 
 
 
 . An equation of this form can be transformed into an integral equation


 
  using the divergence theorem. The integral equation states that the change rate of the integral of the quantity 
 
 
 
  over an arbitrary control volume 
 
 
 
  is given by the flux

 
  through the boundary of the control volume, with 
 
 
 
  being the surface normal through the boundary. 
 
 
 
  is neither produced nor consumed inside of 
 
 
 
  and is hence conserved. A typical choice for 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , with velocity 
 
 
 
 , meaning that the quantity 
 
 
 
  flows with a given velocity field.
The integral form of such equations is usually the physically more natural formulation, and the differential equation arises from differentiation. Since the integral equation can also have non-differentiable solutions, the equality of both formulations can break down in some cases, leading to weak solutions and severe numerical difficulties in simulations of such equations.
Example
An example of a set of equations written in conservation form are the Euler equations of fluid flow:









Each of these represents the conservation of mass, momentum and energy, respectively.
