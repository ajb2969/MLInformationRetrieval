   Choline oxidase      Choline oxidase   In enzymology , a choline oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   choline + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   betaine aldehyde + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are choline and O 2 , whereas its two products are betaine aldehyde and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is choline:oxygen 1-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in glycine , serine , and threonine metabolism. It employs one cofactor , FAD .
