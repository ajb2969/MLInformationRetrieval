   Dimethylpropiothetin dethiomethylase      Dimethylpropiothetin dethiomethylase   In enzymology , a dimethylpropiothetin dethiomethylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S,S-dimethyl-beta-propiothetin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dimethyl sulfide + acrylate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , S,S-dimethyl-beta-propiothetin , and two products , dimethyl sulfide and acrylate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S,S-dimethyl-beta-propiothetin dimethyl-sulfide-lyase (acrylate-forming) . Other names in common use include desulfhydrase , and S,S-dimethyl-beta-propiothetin dimethyl-sulfide-lyase .  References     "  Category:EC 4.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
