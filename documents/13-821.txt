A right conoid as a ruled surface.

In geometry, a right conoid is a ruled surface generated by a family of straight lines that all intersect perpendicularly a fixed straight line, called the axis of the right conoid.
Using a Cartesian coordinate system in three-dimensional space, if we take the z-axis to be the axis of a right conoid, then the right conoid can be represented by the parametric equations:



where h(u) is some function for representing the height of the moving line.

Generation of a typical right conoid

A typical example of right conoids is given by the parametric equations



The image on the right shows how the coplanar lines generate the right conoid.
Other right conoids include:

Helicoid


Whitney umbrella


Wallis’s conical edge


Plücker’s conoid


hyperbolic paraboloid

 
  (with x-axis and y-axis as its axes).
