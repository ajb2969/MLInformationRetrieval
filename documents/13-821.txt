   Right conoid      Right conoid   (Figure)  A right conoid as a ruled surface.   In geometry , a right conoid is a ruled surface generated by a family of straight lines that all intersect perpendicularly a fixed straight line, called the axis of the right conoid.  Using a Cartesian coordinate system in three-dimensional space , if we take the z-axis to be the axis of a right conoid, then the right conoid can be represented by the parametric equations :       x  =   v   cos  u     ,    y  =   v   sin  u     ,   z  =   h   (  u  )         formulae-sequence    x    v    u      formulae-sequence    y    v    u       z    h  u       x=v\cos u,y=v\sin u,z=h(u)\,     where h ( u ) is some function for representing the height of the moving line.  Examples  (Figure)  Generation of a typical right conoid   A typical example of right conoids is given by the parametric equations       x  =   v   cos  u     ,    y  =   v   sin  u     ,   z  =   2   sin   u          formulae-sequence    x    v    u      formulae-sequence    y    v    u       z    2    u        x=v\cos u,y=v\sin u,z=2\sin u\,     The image on the right shows how the coplanar lines generate the right conoid.
