Two-vector

A two-vector is a tensor of type (2,0) and it is the dual of a two-form, meaning that it is a linear functional which maps two-forms to the real numbers (or more generally, to scalars).
The tensor product of a pair of vectors is a two-vector. Then, any two-form can be expressed as a linear combination of tensor products of pairs of vectors, especially a linear combination of tensor products of pairs of basis vectors. If f is a two-vector, then


 
  where the f α β are the components of the two-vector. Notice that both indices of the components are contravariant. This is always the case for two-vectors, by definition.
An example of a two-vector is the inverse gμ ν of the metric tensor.
The components of a two-vector may be represented in a matrix-like array. However, a two-vector, as a tensor, should not be confused with a matrix, since a matrix is a linear function


 
  which maps vectors to vectors, whereas a two-vector is a linear functional


 
  which maps one-forms to vectors. In this sense, a matrix, considered as a tensor, is a mixed tensor of type (1,1) even though of the same rank as a two-vector.
