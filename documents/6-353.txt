   Two-vector      Two-vector   A two-vector is a tensor of type (2,0) and it is the dual of a two-form , meaning that it is a linear functional which maps two-forms to the real numbers (or more generally, to scalars).  The tensor product of a pair of vectors is a two-vector. Then, any two-form can be expressed as a linear combination of tensor products of pairs of vectors, especially a linear combination of tensor products of pairs of basis vectors. If f is a two-vector, then      𝐟  =      f   α  β       e  →   α    ⊗    e  →   β        𝐟   tensor-product     superscript  f    α  β     subscript   normal-→  e   α     subscript   normal-→  e   β      \mathbf{f}=f^{\alpha\beta}\,\vec{e}_{\alpha}\otimes\vec{e}_{\beta}   where the f α β are the components of the two-vector. Notice that both indices of the components are contravariant . This is always the case for two-vectors, by definition.  An example of a two-vector is the inverse g μ ν of the metric tensor .  The components of a two-vector may be represented in a matrix-like array. However, a two-vector, as a tensor, should not be confused with a matrix , since a matrix is a linear function      M  :   V  →  V      normal-:  M   normal-→  V  V     M:V\rightarrow V   which maps vectors to vectors, whereas a two-vector is a linear functional      𝐟  :    V  ~   →  V      normal-:  𝐟   normal-→   normal-~  V   V     \mathbf{f}:\tilde{V}\rightarrow V   which maps one-forms to vectors. In this sense, a matrix, considered as a tensor, is a mixed tensor of type (1,1) even though of the same rank as a two-vector.  "  Category:Tensors
