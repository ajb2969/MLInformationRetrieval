   Moduli stack of principal bundles      Moduli stack of principal bundles   In algebraic geometry, given a smooth  projective curve  X over a finite field    𝐅  q     subscript  𝐅  q    \mathbf{F}_{q}   and a smooth affine  group scheme  G over it, the moduli stack of principal bundles over X , denoted by     Bun  G    (  X  )       subscript  Bun  G   X    \operatorname{Bun}_{G}(X)   , is an algebraic stack given by: 1 for any    𝐅  q     subscript  𝐅  q    \mathbf{F}_{q}   -algebra R ,         Bun  G    (  X  )     (  R  )    =          subscript  Bun  G   X   R   absent    \operatorname{Bun}_{G}(X)(R)=   the category of principal G -bundles over the relative curve    X   ×   𝐅  q     Spec  R       subscript    subscript  𝐅  q    X   Spec  R     X\times_{\mathbf{F}_{q}}\operatorname{Spec}R   . In particular, the category of    𝐅  q     subscript  𝐅  q    \mathbf{F}_{q}   -points of     Bun  G    (  X  )       subscript  Bun  G   X    \operatorname{Bun}_{G}(X)   , that is,      Bun  G    (  X  )     (   𝐅  q   )        subscript  Bun  G   X    subscript  𝐅  q     \operatorname{Bun}_{G}(X)(\mathbf{F}_{q})   , is the category of G -bundles over X .  Similarly,     Bun  G    (  X  )       subscript  Bun  G   X    \operatorname{Bun}_{G}(X)   can also be defined when the curve X is over the field of complex numbers. Roughly, in the complex case, one can define     Bun  G    (  X  )       subscript  Bun  G   X    \operatorname{Bun}_{G}(X)   as the quotient stack of the space of holomorphic connections on X by the gauge group . Replacing the quotient stack (which is not a topological space) by a homotopy quotient (which is a topological space) gives the homotopy type of     Bun  G    (  X  )       subscript  Bun  G   X    \operatorname{Bun}_{G}(X)   .  In the finite field case, it is not common to define the homotopy type of     Bun  G    (  X  )       subscript  Bun  G   X    \operatorname{Bun}_{G}(X)   . But one can still define a ( smooth ) cohomology and homology of     Bun  G    (  X  )       subscript  Bun  G   X    \operatorname{Bun}_{G}(X)    .  Basic properties  It is known that     Bun  G    (  X  )       subscript  Bun  G   X    \operatorname{Bun}_{G}(X)   is a smooth stack of dimension     (    g   (  X  )    -  1   )    dim  G           g  X   1    dimension  G     (g(X)-1)\dim G   where    g   (  X  )       g  X    g(X)   is the genus of X . It is not of finite type but of locally of finite type; one thus usually uses a stratification by open substacks of finite type (cf. the Harder–Narasimhan stratification .) If G is a split reductive group, then the set of connected components     π  0    (    Bun  G    (  X  )    )        subscript  π  0     subscript  Bun  G   X     \pi_{0}(\operatorname{Bun}_{G}(X))   is in a natural bijection with the fundamental group     π  1    (  G  )        subscript  π  1   G    \pi_{1}(G)   . 2  The Atiyah–Bott formula  Behrend's trace formula  This is a (conjectural) version of the Lefschetz trace formula for     Bun  G    (  X  )       subscript  Bun  G   X    \operatorname{Bun}_{G}(X)   when X is over a finite field, introduced by Behrend in 1993. 3 It states: 4 if G is a smooth affine group scheme with semisimple connected generic fiber , then       #     Bun  G    (  X  )     (   𝐅  q   )     =    q   dim    Bun  G    (  X  )       tr   (   ϕ   -  1    |    H  *    (    Bun  G    (  X  )    ;   ℤ  l   )    )           normal-#     subscript  Bun  G   X    subscript  𝐅  q        superscript  q   dimension    subscript  Bun  G   X      tr   superscript  ϕ    1       superscript  H       subscript  Bun  G   X    subscript  ℤ  l         \#\operatorname{Bun}_{G}(X)(\mathbf{F}_{q})=q^{\dim\operatorname{Bun}_{G}(X)}%
 \operatorname{tr}(\phi^{-1}|H^{*}(\operatorname{Bun}_{G}(X);\mathbb{Z}_{l}))   where (see also Behrend's trace formula for the details)   l is a prime number that is not p and the ring    ℤ  l     subscript  ℤ  l    \mathbb{Z}_{l}   of l-adic integers is viewed as a subring of   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   .     ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is the geometric Frobenius .       #     Bun  G    (  X  )     (   𝐅  q   )     =    ∑  P    1   #   Aut   (  P  )             normal-#     subscript  Bun  G   X    subscript  𝐅  q       subscript   P     1    normal-#   Aut  P        \#\operatorname{Bun}_{G}(X)(\mathbf{F}_{q})=\sum_{P}{1\over\#\operatorname{Aut%
 }(P)}   , the sum running over all isomorphism classes of G-bundles on X and convergent.       tr   (   ϕ   -  1    |   V  *   )    =    ∑   i  =  0   ∞      (   -  1   )   i    tr   (   ϕ   -  1    |   V  i   )           tr   superscript  ϕ    1     subscript  V       superscript   subscript     i  0         superscript    1   i    tr   superscript  ϕ    1     subscript  V  i        \operatorname{tr}(\phi^{-1}|V_{*})=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{i}\operatorname{tr%
 }(\phi^{-1}|V_{i})   for a graded vector space     V  *     subscript  V     V_{*}   , provided the series on the right absolutely converges.   A priori, neither left nor right side in the formula converges. Thus, the formula states that the two sides converge to finite numbers and that those numbers coincide.  Notes  References   J.
