Bussgang theorem

In mathematics, the Bussgang theorem is a theorem of stochastic analysis. The theorem states that the crosscorrelation of a Gaussian signal before and after it has passed through a nonlinear operation are equal up to a constant. It was first published by Julian J. Bussgang in 1952 while he was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.1
Statement of the theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be a zero-mean stationary Gaussian random process and 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a nonlinear amplitude distortion.
If 
 
 
 
  is the autocorrelation function of 
 
 
 
 , then the cross-correlation function of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a constant that depends only on 
 
 
 
 .
It can be further shown that



Application
This theorem implies that a simplified correlator can be designed. Instead of having to multiply two signals, the cross-correlation problem reduces to the gating of one signal with another.
