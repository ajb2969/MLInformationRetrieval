   Bussgang theorem      Bussgang theorem   In mathematics , the Bussgang theorem is a theorem of stochastic analysis . The theorem states that the crosscorrelation of a Gaussian signal before and after it has passed through a nonlinear operation are equal up to a constant. It was first published by Julian J. Bussgang in 1952 while he was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . 1  Statement of the theorem  Let    {   X   (  t  )    }       X  t     \left\{X(t)\right\}   be a zero-mean stationary Gaussian random process and     {   Y   (  t  )    }   =   g   (   X   (  t  )    )           Y  t      g    X  t      \left\{Y(t)\right\}=g(X(t))   where    g   (  ⋅  )       g  normal-⋅    g(\cdot)   is a nonlinear amplitude distortion.  If     R  X    (  τ  )        subscript  R  X   τ    R_{X}(\tau)   is the autocorrelation function of    {   X   (  t  )    }       X  t     \left\{X(t)\right\}   , then the cross-correlation function of    {   X   (  t  )    }       X  t     \left\{X(t)\right\}   and    {   Y   (  t  )    }       Y  t     \left\{Y(t)\right\}   is         R   X  Y     (  τ  )    =   C   R  X    (  τ  )     ,         subscript  R    X  Y    τ     C   subscript  R  X   τ     R_{XY}(\tau)=CR_{X}(\tau),   where   C   C   C   is a constant that depends only on    g   (  ⋅  )       g  normal-⋅    g(\cdot)   .  It can be further shown that       C  =    1    σ  3     2  π        ∫   -  ∞   ∞    u  g   (  u  )     e   -    u  2    2   σ  2        d  u      .      C      1     superscript  σ  3       2  π        superscript   subscript            u  g  u   superscript  e       superscript  u  2     2   superscript  σ  2       d  u       C=\frac{1}{\sigma^{3}\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}ug(u)e^{-\frac{u^{2}}{%
 2\sigma^{2}}}\,du.     Application  This theorem implies that a simplified correlator can be designed. Instead of having to multiply two signals, the cross-correlation problem reduces to the gating of one signal with another.  References  Further reading   E.W. Bai; V. Cerone; D.
