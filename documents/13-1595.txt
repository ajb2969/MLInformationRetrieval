  |- !Orthogonal projections in B6 Coxeter plane |} In six-dimensional geometry, a truncated 6-cube (or truncated hexeract) is a convex uniform 6-polytope, being a truncation of the regular 6-cube.
There are 5 truncations for the 6-cube. Vertices of the truncated 6-cube are located as pairs on the edge of the 6-cube. Vertices of the bitruncated 6-cube are located on the square faces of the 6-cube. Vertices of the tritruncated 6-cube are located inside the cubic cells of the 6-cube.  {{-}}

Construction and coordinates
The truncated 6-cube may be constructed by truncating the vertices of the 6-cube at 
 
 
 
  of the edge length. A regular 5-simplex replaces each original vertex.
The Cartesian coordinates of the vertices of a truncated 6-cube having edge length 2 are the permutations of:
