   Densely defined operator      Densely defined operator   In mathematics — specifically, in operator theory — a densely defined operator or partially defined operator is a type of partially defined function . In a topological sense, it is a linear operator that is defined "almost everywhere". Densely defined operators often arise in functional analysis as operations that one would like to apply to a larger class of objects than those for which they a priori "make sense".  Definition  A densely defined linear operator T from one topological vector space , X , to another one, Y , is a linear operator that is defined on a dense linear subspace dom( T ) of X and takes values in Y , written T : dom( T ) ⊆ X → Y . Sometimes this is abbreviated as T : X → Y when the context makes it clear that X might not be the set-theoretic domain of T .  Examples   Consider the space C 0 ([0, 1]; R ) of all real-valued , continuous functions defined on the unit interval; let C 1 ([0, 1]; R ) denote the subspace consisting of all continuously differentiable functions . Equip C 0 ([0, 1]; R ) with the supremum norm ||·|| ∞ ; this makes C 0 ([0, 1]; R ) into a real Banach space . The differentiation operator D given by           (   D  u   )    (  x  )    =    u  ′    (  x  )            normal-D  u   x      superscript  u  normal-′   x     (\mathrm{D}u)(x)=u^{\prime}(x)\,         is a densely defined operator from C 0 ([0, 1]; R ) to itself, defined on the dense subspace C 1 ([0, 1]; R ). Note also that the operator D is an example of an unbounded linear operator , since           u  n    (  x  )    =    e   -   n  x             subscript  u  n   x    superscript  e      n  x       u_{n}(x)=e^{-nx}\,         has             ∥   D   u  n    ∥   ∞     ∥   u  n   ∥   ∞    =  n   .         subscript   norm    normal-D   subscript  u  n        subscript   norm   subscript  u  n       n    \frac{\|\mathrm{D}u_{n}\|_{\infty}}{\|u_{n}\|_{\infty}}=n.         This unboundedness causes problems if one wishes to somehow continuously extend the differentiation operator D to the whole of C 0 ([0, 1]; R ).    The Paley–Wiener integral , on the other hand, is an example of a continuous extension of a densely defined operator. In any abstract Wiener space  i : H → E with adjoint  j = i ∗ : E ∗ → H , there is a natural continuous linear operator (in fact it is the inclusion, and is an isometry ) from j ( E ∗ ) to L 2 ( E , γ ; R ), under which j ( f ) ∈ j ( E ∗ ) ⊆ H goes to the equivalence class [ f ] of f in L 2 ( E , γ ; R ). It is not hard to show that j ( E ∗ ) is dense in H . Since the above inclusion is continuous, there is a unique continuous linear extension I : H → L 2 ( E , γ ; R ) of the inclusion j ( E ∗ ) → L 2 ( E , γ ; R ) to the whole of H . This extension is the Paley–Wiener map.   References     "  Category:Operator theory
