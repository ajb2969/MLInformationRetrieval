   Dedekind psi function      Dedekind psi function   In number theory , the Dedekind psi function is the multiplicative function on the positive integers defined by        ψ   (  n  )    =   n    ∏   p  |  n     (   1  +   1  p    )      ,        ψ  n     n    subscript  product   fragments  p  normal-|  n      1    1  p        \psi(n)=n\prod_{p|n}\left(1+\frac{1}{p}\right),     where the product is taken over all primes p dividing n (by convention, ψ(1) is the empty product and so has value 1). The function was introduced by Richard Dedekind in connection with modular functions .  The value of ψ( n ) for the first few integers n is:   1, 3, 4, 6, 6, 12, 8, 12, 12, 18, 12, 24 ... .   ψ( n ) is greater than n for all n greater than 1, and is even for all n greater than 2. If n is a square-free number then ψ( n ) = σ( n ) .  The ψ function can also be defined by setting ψ(p n ) = (p+1)p n-1 for powers of any prime p , and then extending the definition to all integers by multiplicativity. This also leads to a proof of the generating function in terms of the Riemann zeta function , which is        ∑    ψ   (  n  )     n  s     =    ζ   (  s  )   ζ   (   s  -  1   )     ζ   (   2  s   )      .            ψ  n    superscript  n  s         ζ  s  ζ    s  1      ζ    2  s       \sum\frac{\psi(n)}{n^{s}}=\frac{\zeta(s)\zeta(s-1)}{\zeta(2s)}.     This is also a consequence of the fact that we can write as a Dirichlet convolution of    ψ  =   Id  *   |  μ  |        ψ    Id    μ      \psi=\mathrm{Id}*|\mu|   .  Higher Orders  The generalization to higher orders via ratios of Jordan's totient is        ψ  k    (  n  )    =     J   2  k     (  n  )      J  k    (  n  )            subscript  ψ  k   n        subscript  J    2  k    n      subscript  J  k   n      \psi_{k}(n)=\frac{J_{2k}(n)}{J_{k}(n)}     with Dirichlet series        ∑   n  ≥  1       ψ  k    (  n  )     n  s     =    ζ   (  s  )   ζ   (   s  -  k   )     ζ   (   2  s   )           subscript     n  1         subscript  ψ  k   n    superscript  n  s         ζ  s  ζ    s  k      ζ    2  s       \sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{\psi_{k}(n)}{n^{s}}=\frac{\zeta(s)\zeta(s-k)}{\zeta(2s)}   .  It is also the Dirichlet convolution of a power and the square of the Möbius function ,        ψ  k    (  n  )    =     n  k   *   μ  2     (  n  )           subscript  ψ  k   n        superscript  n  k    superscript  μ  2    n     \psi_{k}(n)=n^{k}*\mu^{2}(n)   .  If       ϵ  2   =   1  ,  0  ,  0  ,  1  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  1  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  1  ,  0  ,  0  ,   0  …         subscript  ϵ  2    1  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0    0  normal-…      \epsilon_{2}=1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0\ldots     is the characteristic function of the squares, another Dirichlet convolution leads to the generalized σ-function ,          ϵ  2    (  n  )    *   ψ  k     (  n  )    =    σ  k    (  n  )               subscript  ϵ  2   n    subscript  ψ  k    n      subscript  σ  k   n     \epsilon_{2}(n)*\psi_{k}(n)=\sigma_{k}(n)   .
