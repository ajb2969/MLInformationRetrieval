Dedekind psi function

In number theory, the Dedekind psi function is the multiplicative function on the positive integers defined by



where the product is taken over all primes p dividing n (by convention, ψ(1) is the empty product and so has value 1). The function was introduced by Richard Dedekind in connection with modular functions.
The value of ψ(n) for the first few integers n is:

1, 3, 4, 6, 6, 12, 8, 12, 12, 18, 12, 24 ... .
 

ψ(n) is greater than n for all n greater than 1, and is even for all n greater than 2. If n is a square-free number then ψ(n) = σ(n).
The ψ function can also be defined by setting ψ(pn) = (p+1)pn-1 for powers of any prime p, and then extending the definition to all integers by multiplicativity. This also leads to a proof of the generating function in terms of the Riemann zeta function, which is



This is also a consequence of the fact that we can write as a Dirichlet convolution of

Higher Orders
The generalization to higher orders via ratios of Jordan's totient is

It is also the Dirichlet convolution of a power and the square of the Möbius function,

If



is the characteristic function of the squares, another Dirichlet convolution leads to the generalized σ-function,
