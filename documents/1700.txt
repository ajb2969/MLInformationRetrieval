   Steinitz exchange lemma      Steinitz exchange lemma   The Steinitz exchange lemma is a basic theorem in linear algebra used, for example, to show that any two bases for a finite- dimensional  vector space have the same number of elements. The result is named after the German mathematician Ernst Steinitz . The result is often called the Steinitz–Mac Lane exchange lemma , also recognizing the generalization 1 by Saunders Mac Lane of Steinitz's lemma to matroids . 2  Statement  If { v 1 , ..., v m } is a set of m  linearly independent vectors in a vector space V , and { w 1 , ..., w n } span  V then m ≤ n and, possibly after reordering the w i , the set { v 1 , ..., v m , w m + 1 , ..., w n } spans V .  Proof  We are going to show that for any integer   k   k   k   satisfying    0  ≤  k  ≤  m        0  k       m     0\leq k\leq m   , the following assertion is valid. Choosing    k  =  m      k  m    k=m   gives the result.  (A) The set    {   v  1   ,  …  ,   v  k   ,   w   k  +  1    ,  …  ,   w  n   }      subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  k    subscript  w    k  1    normal-…   subscript  w  n     \{v_{1},\ldots,v_{k},w_{k+1},\ldots,w_{n}\}   spans   V   V   V   (where the    w  j     subscript  w  j    w_{j}   have possibly been reordered, and the reordering depends on   k   k   k   ).  We will prove (A) by induction over   k   k   k   : Since (A) is clear for    k  =  0      k  0    k=0   , the only thing that needs to be done is the inductive step.  Assume that (A) holds for some   k   k   k   satisfying    {   v  1   ,  …  ,   v  k   ,   w   k  +  1    ,  …  ,   w  n   }      subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  k    subscript  w    k  1    normal-…   subscript  w  n     \{v_{1},\ldots,v_{k},w_{k+1},\ldots,w_{n}\}   , and   V   V   V   spans     μ  1   ,  …  ,   μ  n       subscript  μ  1   normal-…   subscript  μ  n     \mu_{1},\ldots,\mu_{n}   (by the induction hypothesis), there exist      v   k  +  1    =     ∑   j  =  1   k     μ  j    v  j     +    ∑   j  =   k  +  1    n     μ  j    w  j       .       subscript  v    k  1        superscript   subscript     j  1    k      subscript  μ  j    subscript  v  j       superscript   subscript     j    k  1     n      subscript  μ  j    subscript  w  j        v_{k+1}=\sum_{j=1}^{k}\mu_{j}v_{j}+\sum_{j=k+1}^{n}\mu_{j}w_{j}.   such that      {   μ   k  +  1    ,  …  ,   μ  n   }      subscript  μ    k  1    normal-…   subscript  μ  n     \{\mu_{k+1},\ldots,\mu_{n}\}   At least one of    {   v  1   ,  …  ,   v  m   }      subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  m     \{v_{1},\ldots,v_{m}\}   must be non-zero, otherwise this equality would contradict the linear independence of    μ   k  +  1      subscript  μ    k  1     \mu_{k+1}   ; note that this additionally implies that     w   k  +  1    =    1   μ   k  +  1      (    v   k  +  1    -    ∑   j  =  1   k     μ  j    v  j     -    ∑   j  =   k  +  2    n     μ  j    w  j      )         subscript  w    k  1        1   subscript  μ    k  1        subscript  v    k  1      superscript   subscript     j  1    k      subscript  μ  j    subscript  v  j       superscript   subscript     j    k  2     n      subscript  μ  j    subscript  w  j         w_{k+1}=\frac{1}{\mu_{k+1}}\left(v_{k+1}-\sum_{j=1}^{k}\mu_{j}v_{j}-\sum_{j=k+%
 2}^{n}\mu_{j}w_{j}\right)   , we may assume that    w   k  +  1      subscript  w    k  1     w_{k+1}   is not zero. Therefore, we have      {   v  1   ,  …  ,   v   k  +  1    ,   w   k  +  2    ,  …  ,   w  n   }      subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v    k  1     subscript  w    k  2    normal-…   subscript  w  n     \{v_{1},\ldots,v_{k+1},w_{k+2},\ldots,w_{n}\}   In other words,   V   V   V   is in the span of    k  +  1      k  1    k+1   and so the latter must be the whole of $V$ . We have thus shown that (A) holds for $k+1$ , completing the inductive step.
