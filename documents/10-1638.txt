D-lysine 5,6-aminomutase

In enzymology, a D-lysine 5,6-aminomutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-lysine 
 
 
 
  2,5-diaminohexanoate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, D-lysine, and one product, 2,5-diaminohexanoate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring amino groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-2,6-diaminohexanoate 5,6-aminomutase. Other names in common use include D-alpha-lysine mutase, and adenosylcobalamin-dependent D-lysine 5,6-aminomutase. This enzyme participates in lysine degradation. It employs one cofactor, cobamide.
Structure
The structure of the alpha subunit is predominantly a PLP-binding TIM barrel domain, with several additional alpha-helices and beta-strands at the N and C termini. These helices and strands form an intertwined accessory clamp structure that wraps around the sides of the TIM barrel and extends up toward the Ado ligand of the Cbl cofactor, providing most of the interactions observed between the protein and the Ado ligand of the Cbl, suggesting that its role is mainly in stabilising AdoCbl in the precatalytic resting state.1
