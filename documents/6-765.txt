   MV-algebra      MV-algebra   In abstract algebra , a branch of pure mathematics , an MV-algebra is an algebraic structure with a binary operation    ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus   , a unary operation    ¬     \neg   , and the constant   0   0    , satisfying certain axioms. MV-algebras are the algebraic semantics of Łukasiewicz logic ; the letters MV refer to the many-valued logic of Łukasiewicz. MV-algebras coincide with the class of bounded commutative BCK algebras .  Definitions  An MV-algebra is an algebraic structure      ⟨  A  ,  ⊕  ,  ¬  ,  0  ⟩   ,     A  direct-sum   0    \langle A,\oplus,\lnot,0\rangle,   consisting of   a non-empty  set     A  ,    A   A,     a binary operation    ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus   on    A  ,    A   A,     a unary operation    ¬     \lnot   on    A  ,    A   A,   and  a constant   0   0    denoting a fixed element of    A  ,    A   A,      which satisfies the following identities :          (   x  ⊕  y   )   ⊕  z   =   x  ⊕   (   y  ⊕  z   )     ,       direct-sum   direct-sum  x  y   z    direct-sum  x   direct-sum  y  z      (x\oplus y)\oplus z=x\oplus(y\oplus z),           x  ⊕  0   =  x   ,       direct-sum  x  0   x    x\oplus 0=x,           x  ⊕  y   =   y  ⊕  x    ,       direct-sum  x  y    direct-sum  y  x     x\oplus y=y\oplus x,           ¬  ¬  x   =  x   ,          x   x    \lnot\lnot x=x,           x  ⊕   ¬  0    =   ¬  0    ,       direct-sum  x     0       0     x\oplus\lnot 0=\lnot 0,   and         ¬   (    ¬  x   ⊕  y   )    ⊕  y   =    ¬   (    ¬  y   ⊕  x   )    ⊕  x    .       direct-sum     direct-sum     x   y    y    direct-sum     direct-sum     y   x    x     \lnot(\lnot x\oplus y)\oplus y=\lnot(\lnot y\oplus x)\oplus x.      By virtue of the first three axioms,    ⟨  A  ,  ⊕  ,  0  ⟩     A  direct-sum  0    \langle A,\oplus,0\rangle   is a commutative monoid . Being defined by identities, MV-algebras form a variety of algebras. The variety of MV-algebras is a subvariety of the variety of BL -algebras and contains all Boolean algebras .  An MV-algebra can equivalently be defined (Hájek 1998) as a prelinear commutative bounded integral residuated lattice     ⟨  L  ,  ∧  ,  ∨  ,  ⊗  ,  →  ,  0  ,  1  ⟩     L    tensor-product  normal-→  0  1    \langle L,\wedge,\vee,\otimes,\rightarrow,0,1\rangle   satisfying the additional identity    x  ∨  y  =   (  x  →  y  )   →  y  .     fragments  x   y    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-→  y  normal-)   normal-→  y  normal-.    x\vee y=(x\rightarrow y)\rightarrow y.     Examples of MV-algebras  A simple numerical example is     A  =   [  0  ,  1  ]    ,      A   0  1     A=[0,1],   with operations     x  ⊕  y   =   min   (   x  +  y   ,  1  )         direct-sum  x  y       x  y   1     x\oplus y=\min(x+y,1)   and      ¬  x   =   1  -  x    .         x     1  x     \lnot x=1-x.   In mathematical fuzzy logic, this MV-algebra is called the standard MV-algebra , as it forms the standard real-valued semantics of Łukasiewicz logic .  The trivial MV-algebra has the only element 0 and the operations defined in the only possible way,     0  ⊕  0   =  0       direct-sum  0  0   0    0\oplus 0=0   and     ¬  0   =  0.         0   0.    \lnot 0=0.     The two-element MV-algebra is actually the two-element Boolean algebra      {  0  ,  1  }   ,     0  1    \{0,1\},   with   ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus   coinciding with Boolean disjunction and   ¬     \lnot   with Boolean negation. In fact adding the axiom     x  ⊕  x   =  x       direct-sum  x  x   x    x\oplus x=x   to the axioms defining an MV-algebra results in an axiomantization of Boolean algebras.  If instead the axiom added is     x  ⊕  x  ⊕  x   =   x  ⊕  x        direct-sum  x  x  x    direct-sum  x  x     x\oplus x\oplus x=x\oplus x   , then the axioms define the MV 3 algebra corresponding to the three-valued Łukasiewicz logic Ł 3 . Other finite linearly ordered MV-algebras are obtained by restricting the universe and operations of the standard MV-algebra to the set of   n   n   n   equidistant real numbers between 0 and 1 (both included), that is, the set     {  0  ,   1  /   (   n  -  1   )    ,   2  /   (   n  -  1   )    ,  …  ,  1  }   ,     0    1    n  1      2    n  1    normal-…  1    \{0,1/(n-1),2/(n-1),\dots,1\},   which is closed under the operations   ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus   and   ¬     \lnot   of the standard MV-algebra; these algebras are usually denoted MV n .  Another important example is Chang's MV-algebra , consisting just of infinitesimals (with the order type ω) and their co-infinitesimals.  Chang also constructed an MV-algebra from an arbitrary totally ordered abelian group  G by fixing a positive element u and defining the segment [0, u ] as { x ∈ G | 0 ≤ x ≤ u }, which becomes an MV-algebra with x ⊕ y = min( u , x + y ) and ¬ x = u − x . Furthermore, Chang showed that every linearly ordered MV-algebra is isomorphic to an MV-algebra constructed from a group in this way.  D. Mundici extended the above construction to abelian lattice-ordered groups . If G is such a group with strong (order) unit u , then the "unit interval" { x ∈ G | 0 ≤ x ≤ u } can be equipped with ¬ x = u − x , x ⊕ y = u ∧ G (x+y), x ⊗ y = 0∨ G ( x + y − u ). This construction establishes a categorical equivalence between lattice-ordered abelian groups with strong unit and MV-algebras.  Relation to Łukasiewicz logic  C. C. Chang devised MV-algebras to study many-valued logics , introduced by Jan Łukasiewicz in 1920. In particular, MV-algebras form the algebraic semantics of Łukasiewicz logic , as described below.  Given an MV-algebra A , an A - valuation is a homomorphism from the algebra of propositional formulas (in the language consisting of     ⊕  ,  ¬   ,     direct-sum     \oplus,\lnot,   and 0) into A . Formulas mapped to 1 (or   ¬     \lnot   0) for all A -valuations are called A - tautologies . If the standard MV-algebra over [0,1] is employed, the set of all [0,1]-tautologies determines so-called infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic .  Chang's (1958, 1959) completeness theorem states that any MV-algebra equation holding in the standard MV-algebra over the interval [0,1] will hold in every MV-algebra. Algebraically, this means that the standard MV-algebra generates the variety of all MV-algebras. Equivalently, Chang's completeness theorem says that MV-algebras characterize infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic , defined as the set of [0,1]-tautologies.  The way the [0,1] MV-algebra characterizes all possible MV-algebras parallels the well-known fact that identities holding in the two-element Boolean algebra hold in all possible Boolean algebras. Moreover, MV-algebras characterize infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic in a manner analogous to the way that Boolean algebras characterize classical bivalent logic (see Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra ).  In 1984, Font, Rodriguez and Torrens introduced the Wajsberg algebra as an alternative model for the infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic. Wajsberg algebras and MV-algebras are isomorphic. 1  MV n -algebras  In the 1940s Grigore Moisil introduced his Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebras (LM n -algebras) in the hope of giving algebraic semantics for the (finitely) n -valued Łukasiewicz logic . However, in 1956 Alan Rose discovered that for n ≥ 5, the Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra does not model the Łukasiewicz n -valued logic. Although C. C. Chang published his MV-algebra in 1958, it is faithful model only for the ℵ 0 -valued (infinitely-many-valued) Łukasiewicz–Tarski logic . For the axiomatically more complicated (finitely) n -valued Łukasiewicz logics, suitable algebras were published in 1977 by Revaz Grigolia and called MV n -algebras. 2 MV n -algebras are a subclass of LM n -algebras; the inclusion is strict for n ≥ 5. 3  The MV n -algebras are MV-algebras which satisfy some additional axioms, just like the n -valued Łukasiewicz logics have additional axioms added to the ℵ 0 -valued logic.  In 1982 Roberto Cignoli published some additional constraints that added to LM n -algebras are proper models for n -valued Łukasiewicz logic; Cignoli called his discovery ''proper n -valued Łukasiewicz algebras''. 4 The LM n -algebras that are also MV n -algebras are precisely Cignoli’s proper n-valued Łukasiewicz algebras. 5  Relation to functional analysis  MV-algebras were related by Daniele Mundici to approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebras by establishing a bijective correspondence between all isomorphism classes of AF C*-algebras with lattice-ordered dimension group and all isomorphism classes of countable MV algebras. Some instances of this correspondence include:      Countable MV algebra   AF C*-algebra       {0, 1}   ℂ     {0, 1/ n , ..., 1 }   M n (ℂ), i.e. n × n complex matrices     finite   finite-dimensional     boolean   commutative     In software  There are multiple frameworks implementing fuzzy logic (type II), and most of them implement what has been called a multi-adjoint logic . This is no more than the implementation of a MV-algebra.  References   Chang, C. C.
