Glucosylceramide beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase

Glucosylceramide beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (, lactosylceramide synthase, uridine diphosphate-galactose:glucosyl ceramide beta 1-4 galactosyltransferase, UDP-Gal:glucosylceramide beta1->4galactosyltransferase, GalT-2, UDP-galactose:beta-D-glucosyl-(11)-ceramide beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name UDP-alpha-D-galactose:beta-D-glucosyl-(11)-ceramide 4-beta-D-galactosyltransferase.12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

UDP-alpha-D-galactose + beta-D-glucosyl-(11)-ceramide 
 
 
 
  UDP + beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-(11)-ceramide
 

Involved in the synthesis of several different major classes of glycosphingolipids.
