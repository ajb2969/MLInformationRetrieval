Acetoacetyl-CoA hydrolase




Acetoacetyl-CoA hydrolase

In enzymology, an acetoacetyl-CoA hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acetoacetyl-CoA + H2O 
 
 
 
  CoA + acetoacetate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetoacetyl-CoA and H2O, whereas its two products are CoA and acetoacetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetoacetyl-CoA hydrolase. Other names in common use include acetoacetyl coenzyme A hydrolase, acetoacetyl CoA deacylase, and acetoacetyl coenzyme A deacylase. This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism.
