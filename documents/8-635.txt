   Natural filtration      Natural filtration   In the theory of stochastic processes in mathematics and statistics , the natural filtration associated to a stochastic process is a filtration associated to the process which records its "past behaviour" at each time. It is in a sense the simplest filtration available for studying the given process: all information concerning the process, and only that information, is available in the natural filtration.  More formally, let (Ω, F , P ) be a probability space ; let ( I , ≤) be a totally ordered  index set ; let ( S , Σ) be a measurable space ; let X : I × Ω → S be a stochastic process. Then the natural filtration of  F  with respect to  X is defined to be the filtration F • X = ( F i X ) i ∈ I given by        F  i  X   =   σ   {    X  j   -  1     (  A  )    |    j  ∈  I   ,    j  ≤  i   ,   A  ∈  Σ     }     ,       superscript   subscript  F  i   X     σ   conditional-set     superscript   subscript  X  j     1    A    formulae-sequence    j  I    formulae-sequence    j  i     A  normal-Σ         F_{i}^{X}=\sigma\left\{\left.X_{j}^{-1}(A)\right|j\in I,j\leq i,A\in\Sigma%
 \right\},     i.e., the smallest σ -algebra on Ω that contains all pre-images of Σ-measurable subsets of S for "times" j up to i .  In many examples, the index set I is the natural numbers  N (possibly including 0) or an interval [0, T ] or [0, +∞); the state space S is often the real line  R or Euclidean space  R n .  Any stochastic process X is an adapted process with respect to its natural filtration.  References     See also   Filtration (mathematics)   "  Category:Stochastic processes
