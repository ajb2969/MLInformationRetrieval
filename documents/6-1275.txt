   Subnormal subgroup      Subnormal subgroup   In mathematics , in the field of group theory , a subgroup  H of a given group  G is a subnormal subgroup of G if there is a finite chain of subgroups of the group, each one normal in the next, beginning at H and ending at G .  In notation,   H   H   H   is   k   k   k   -subnormal in   G   G   G   if there are subgroups       H  =    H  0   ,   H  1   ,   H  2   ,  …    ,    H  k   =  G      formulae-sequence    H    subscript  H  0    subscript  H  1    subscript  H  2   normal-…       subscript  H  k   G     H=H_{0},H_{1},H_{2},\ldots,H_{k}=G     of   G   G   G   such that    H  i     subscript  H  i    H_{i}   is normal in    H   i  +  1      subscript  H    i  1     H_{i+1}   for each   i   i   i   .  A subnormal subgroup is a subgroup that is   k   k   k   -subnormal for some positive integer   k   k   k   . Some facts about subnormal subgroups:   A 1-subnormal subgroup is a proper normal subgroup (and vice versa).  A finitely generated group is nilpotent if and only if each of its subgroups is subnormal.  Every quasinormal subgroup , and, more generally, every conjugate-permutable subgroup , of a finite group is subnormal.  Every pronormal subgroup that is also subnormal, is normal. In particular, a Sylow subgroup is subnormal if and only if it is normal.  Every 2-subnormal subgroup is a conjugate-permutable subgroup.   The property of subnormality is transitive , that is, a subnormal subgroup of a subnormal subgroup is subnormal. The relation of subnormality can be defined as the transitive closure of the relation of normality.  If every subnormal subgroup of G is normal in G , then G is called a T-group .
