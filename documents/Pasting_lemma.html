<h1>Pasting lemma</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a>, the <strong>pasting lemma</strong> is an important result which says that two continuous functions can be "glued together" to create another continuous function. The lemma is implicit in the use of <a href="piecewise_function" title="wikilink">piecewise functions</a>. It is also called the <em>gluing rule</em>. for example in the book <em>Topology and Groupoids</em>, where the more general condition for the statement below is that <span class="LaTeX">$A \setminus B \subseteq \operatorname{Int} A$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$B \setminus A \subseteq \operatorname{Int} B$</span>.</p>
<p>The pasting (or gluing) lemma is crucial to the construction of the <a href="fundamental_group" title="wikilink">fundamental group</a> or <a href="fundamental_groupoid" title="wikilink">fundamental groupoid</a> of a topological space; it allows one to concatenate continuous paths to create a new continuous path.</p>
<h2 id="formal-statement">Formal statement</h2>
<p>Let <span class="LaTeX">$X,Y$</span> be both closed (or both open) subsets of a topological space <em>A</em> such that <span class="LaTeX">$A = X \cup Y$</span>, and let <em>B</em> also be a topological space. If <span class="LaTeX">$f: A \to B$</span> is continuous when restricted to both <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>, then <em>f</em> is continuous.</p>
<p>This result allows one to take two continuous functions defined on closed (or open) subsets of a topological space and create a new one.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>: if <em>U</em> is a closed subset of <em>B</em>, then <span class="LaTeX">$f^{-1}(U )\cap X$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$f^{-1}(U )\cap Y$</span> are both closed since each is the preimage of <em>f</em> when restricted to <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> respectively, which by assumption are continuous. Then their union, <span class="LaTeX">$f^{-1}(U)$</span> is also closed, being a finite union of closed sets.</p>
<p>A similar argument applies when <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> are both open. <span class="LaTeX">$\Box$</span></p>
<p>The infinite analog of this result (where <span class="LaTeX">$A=X_1\cup X_2\cup X_3\cup\cdots$</span>)is not true for closed <span class="LaTeX">$X_1, X_2, X_3\ldots$</span>. (For instance, the inclusion map <span class="LaTeX">$\iota:Z\rightarrow R$</span> from the integers to the real line (with the integers equipped with the <a href="cofinite_topology" title="wikilink">cofinite topology</a>) is continuous when restricted to an integer, but the inverse image of a bounded open set in the reals with this map is at most a finite number of points, so not open in <em>Z</em>.)</p>
<p>It is, however, true if the <span class="LaTeX">$X_1, X_2, X_3\ldots$</span> are open; this follows from the fact that an arbitrary union of open sets is open.</p>
