Purity (quantum mechanics)

In quantum mechanics, and especially quantum information theory, the purity of a quantum state is a scalar defined as



where 
 
 
 
  is the density matrix of the state. The purity can range between unity, corresponding to a completely pure state, and 
 
 
 
 , corresponding to a completely mixed state. (Here, 
 
 
 
  is the dimension of the density matrix.)
Purity is trivially related to the Linear entropy

 
  of a state by



Projectivity of a measurement
For a quantum measurement, the projectivity1 is the purity of its pre-measurement state. This pre-measurement state is the main tool of the retrodictive approach of quantum physics, in which we make predictions about state preparations leading to a given measurement result. It allows us to determine in which kind of states the measured system was prepared for leading to such a result.
