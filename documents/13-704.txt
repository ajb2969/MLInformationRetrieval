   Purity (quantum mechanics)      Purity (quantum mechanics)   In quantum mechanics , and especially quantum information theory, the purity of a quantum state is a scalar defined as       γ   ≡   Tr   (   ρ  2   )        γ    Tr   superscript  ρ  2      \gamma\,\equiv\,\mbox{Tr}(\rho^{2})\,     where    ρ    ρ   \rho\,   is the density matrix of the state. The purity can range between unity, corresponding to a completely pure state, and    1  /   d       1  d    1/d\,   , corresponding to a completely mixed state. (Here,    d    d   d\,   is the dimension of the density matrix.)  Purity is trivially related to the Linear entropy      S  L      subscript  S  L    S_{L}\,   of a state by       γ  =   1  -    S  L      .      γ    1   subscript  S  L      \gamma=1-S_{L}\,.     Projectivity of a measurement  For a quantum measurement, the projectivity 1 is the purity of its pre-measurement state . This pre-measurement state is the main tool of the retrodictive approach of quantum physics, in which we make predictions about state preparations leading to a given measurement result. It allows us to determine in which kind of states the measured system was prepared for leading to such a result.
