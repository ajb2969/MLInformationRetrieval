   Matrix unit      Matrix unit   In mathematics , a matrix unit is an idealisation of the concept of a matrix , with a focus on the algebraic properties of matrix multiplication . The topic is comparatively obscure within linear algebra , because it entirely ignores the numeric properties of matrices; it is mostly encountered in the context of abstract algebra , especially the theory of semigroups .  Despite the name, matrix units are not the same as unit matrices or unitary matrices .  Two matrices can be multiplied when the number of columns in one is the same as the number of rows in the other; otherwise, they are incompatible. The idea behind matrix units is to look at this fact in isolation: a matrix unit is a matrix with dimensions, but with the entries scooped out.  Let I be a nonempty set , to be used for counting the matrix rows and columns. There is no requirement for it to be finite; indeed, standard matrix algebra would use the set of natural numbers (not including zero) N + . A matrix unit is either an ordered pair ( r , c ), with r and c elements of I , or it is a special "zero" object, written as "0". Multiplication is defined as follows:   0 x = x 0 = 0 for any matrix unit x ;  ( r , c ) ( s , d ) = ( r , d ) if c = s , and 0 if c ≠ s .   The 0 element can be seen as an "error symbol" for when multiplication fails; the first rule implies that errors propagate through an entire product containing a single incompatible combination.  For example, the product (with I = N + )   (2, 3) (3, 2) (2, 1) (1, 4) = (2, 4)   represents the abstract matrix multiplication        [     ⋅    ⋅    ⋅      ⋅    ⋅    ⋅     ]    [     ⋅    ⋅      ⋅    ⋅      ⋅    ⋅     ]    [     ⋅      ⋅     ]    [     ⋅    ⋅    ⋅    ⋅     ]    =   [     ⋅    ⋅    ⋅    ⋅      ⋅    ⋅    ⋅        ]           normal-⋅  normal-⋅  normal-⋅    normal-⋅  normal-⋅  normal-⋅      normal-⋅  normal-⋅    normal-⋅  normal-⋅    normal-⋅  normal-⋅      normal-⋅    normal-⋅      normal-⋅  normal-⋅  normal-⋅  normal-⋅       normal-⋅  normal-⋅  normal-⋅  normal-⋅    normal-⋅  normal-⋅  normal-⋅  absent      \begin{bmatrix}\cdot&\cdot&\cdot\\
 \cdot&\cdot&\cdot\\
 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\cdot&\cdot\\

 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\cdot\\
 \cdot\\
 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\cdot&\cdot&\cdot&\cdot\\
 \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\cdot&\cdot&\cdot&\cdot\\
 \cdot&\cdot&\cdot&\\
 \end{bmatrix}   .  Another notation for ( r , c ) is A r c , following the convention for naming a single entry of a matrix. (Different letters are used in the " A " position to refer to matrix units on a different base set.) The composition rule may be expressed using the Kronecker delta as   X r c  X s d = δ c s  X r d .   With these rules, ( I × I ) ∪ {0} is a semigroup with zero. Its construction is analogous to that for other important semigroups, such as rectangular bands and Rees matrix semigroups . It also arises as the trace of the unique D -class of the bicyclic semigroup , meaning that it summarises how composition for members of that class interacts with the structure of the semigroup's principal ideals .  A semigroup of matrix units is 0-simple , because any two nonzero elements generate the same two-sided ideal (the entire semigroup), and the semigroup is non-null. The elements ( r , c ) and ( s , d ) are D -related via   ( r , c ) R ( r , d ) L ( s , d ),   as any pairs are R -related if they have the same first coordinate and L -related if they have the same second coordinate. All H -classes are singletons. The idempotents are the "square" matrix units ( a , a ) for a in I , together with 0.  "  Category:Matrix theory  Category:Semigroup theory
