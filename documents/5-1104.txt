   Weak hypercharge      Weak hypercharge   The weak hypercharge in particle physics is a quantum number relating the electric charge and the third component of weak isospin . It is conserved (only terms that are overall weak-hypercharge neutral are allowed in the Lagrangian) and is similar to the Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula for the hypercharge of strong interactions (which is not conserved in weak interactions). It is frequently denoted Y W and corresponds to the gauge symmetry  U(1) . 1  Definition  Weak hypercharge is the generator of the U(1) component of the electroweak gauge group,  and its associated quantum field  B mixes with the W 3 electroweak quantum field to produce the observed  gauge boson and the photon of quantum electrodynamics .  Weak hypercharge, usually written as Y W , satisfies the equality:       Q   =    T  3   +    Y  W   2        Q     subscript  T  3      subscript  Y  normal-W   2      \qquad Q=T_{3}+{Y_{\rm W}\over 2}   where Q is the electrical charge (in elementary charge units) and T 3 is the third component of weak isospin . Rearranging, the weak hypercharge can be explicitly defined as:        Y   W   =   2   (   Q  -   T  3    )         subscript  Y  normal-W     2    Q   subscript  T  3       \qquad Y_{\rm W}=2(Q-T_{3})          left-handed   el. charge  Q   weak isospin  T 3   weak hyper- charge  Y W   right-handed   el. charge  Q   weak isospin  T 3   weak hyper- charge  Y W       Leptons   , ,   0   +1/2   −1   Do not interact (if exist at all)     , ,   −1   −1/2   −1   , ,   −1   0   −2     Quarks   , ,   +2/3   +1/2   +1/3   , ,   +2/3   0   +4/3     d , s , b     −1/3   −1/2   +1/3   , ,   −1/3   0   −2/3     Note: sometimes weak hypercharge is scaled so that        Y   W   =   Q  -   T  3         subscript  Y  normal-W     Q   subscript  T  3      \qquad Y_{\rm W}=Q-T_{3}   although this is a minority usage. 2  Hypercharge assignments in the Standard Model are determined up to a twofold ambiguity by demanding cancellation of all anomalies.  Baryon and lepton number  Weak hypercharge is related to baryon number minus lepton number via:       X  +   2   Y  W     =   5   (   B  -  L   )          X    2   subscript  Y  normal-W       5    B  L      X+2Y_{\rm W}=5(B-L)\,     where X is a GUT -associated conserved quantum number. Since weak hypercharge is always conserved this implies that baryon number minus lepton number is also always conserved, within the Standard Model and most extensions.  Neutron decay    →  +  +    Hence neutron decay conserves baryon number  B and lepton number  L separately, so also the difference B − L is conserved.  Proton decay  Proton decay is a prediction of many grand unification theories .    →  +  →  + 2    Hence proton decay conserves B − L , even though it violates both lepton number and baryon number conservation.
