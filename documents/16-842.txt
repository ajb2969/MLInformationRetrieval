Brown clustering
In [[natural language processing]], '''Brown clustering''' or '''IBM clustering''' is a form of [[hierarchical clustering]] of words based on the contexts in which they occur, proposed by Peter F. Brown of [[IBM]] in the context of [[language model]]ing.{{cite journal |author1=Peter F. Brown |author2=Peter V. deSouza |author3=Robert L. Mercer |author4=Vincent J. Della Pietra |author5=Jenifer C. Lai |title=Class-based {{mvar|n}}-gram models of natural languag
 e |journal=Computational Linguistics |volume=18 |issue=4 |year=1992 |url=http://aclweb.org/anthology/J/J92/J92-4003.pdf}} The intuition behind the method is that a class-based language model (also called cluster 
 
 
 
 -gram model1), i.e. one where probabilities of words are based on the classes (clusters) of previous words, can overcome the data sparsity problem inherent in language modeling. Jurafsky and Martin give the example of a flight reservation system that needs to estimate the likelihood of the bigram "to Shanghai", without having seen this in a training set. The system can obtain a good estimate if it can cluster "Shanghai" with other city names, then make its estimate based on the likelihood of phrases such as "to London", "to Beijing" and "to Denver".2
Brown clustering is an agglomerative, bottom-up form of clustering that groups words (i.e., types) into a binary tree of classes, using a merging criterion based on the log-probability of a text under a class-based language model, i.e. a probability model that takes the clustering into account. This model has the same general form as a hidden Markov model.3 That is, given cluster membership indicators 
 
 
 
  for the tokens 
 
 
 
  in a text, the probability of the 
 
 
 
  given 
 
 
 
  is given by4



Finding the clustering which maximizes the likelihood of the data is computationally infeasible. The approach proposed by Brown is a greedy heuristic.
Brown clustering generates a fixed number of output classes. It is important to choose the correct number of classes, though this is task-dependent.5 The cluster memberships of words resulting from Brown clustering can be used as features in a variety of machine-learned natural language processing tasks.6
