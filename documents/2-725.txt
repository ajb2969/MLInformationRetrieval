   Hypothetical syllogism      Hypothetical syllogism   In classical logic , hypothetical syllogism is a valid  argument form which is a syllogism having a conditional statement for one or both of its premises . 1 2   If I do not wake up, then I cannot go to work.  If I cannot go to work, then I will not get paid.  Therefore, if I do not wake up, then I will not get paid.   In propositional logic , hypothetical syllogism is the name of a valid rule of inference 3 4 (often abbreviated HS and sometimes also called the chain argument , chain rule , or the principle of transitivity of implication ). Hypothetical syllogism is one of the rules in classical logic that is not always accepted in certain systems of non-classical logic . The rule may be stated:        P  →  Q   ,   Q  →  R      ∴   P  →  R         formulae-sequence   normal-→  P  Q    normal-→  Q  R     therefore  absent   normal-→  P  R      \frac{P\to Q,Q\to R}{\therefore P\to R}     where the rule is that whenever instances of "    P  →  Q     normal-→  P  Q    P\to Q   ", and "    Q  →  R     normal-→  Q  R    Q\to R   " appear on lines of a proof , "    P  →  R     normal-→  P  R    P\to R   " can be placed on a subsequent line.  Hypothetical syllogism is closely related and similar to disjunctive syllogism , in that it is also type of syllogism, and also the name of a rule of inference.  Formal notation  The hypothetical syllogism rule may be written in sequent notation:       (  P  →  Q  )   ,   (  Q  →  R  )   ⊢   (  P  →  R  )      fragments   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→  Q  normal-)   normal-,   fragments  normal-(  Q  normal-→  R  normal-)   proves   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→  R  normal-)     (P\to Q),(Q\to R)\vdash(P\to R)     where   ⊢   proves   \vdash   is a metalogical symbol meaning that    P  →  R     normal-→  P  R    P\to R   is a syntactic consequence of    P  →  Q     normal-→  P  Q    P\to Q   , and    Q  →  R     normal-→  Q  R    Q\to R   in some logical system ;  and expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic :       (   (  P  →  Q  )   and   (  Q  →  R  )   )   →   (  P  →  R  )      fragments   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→  Q  normal-)   and   fragments  normal-(  Q  normal-→  R  normal-)   normal-)   normal-→   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→  R  normal-)     ((P\to Q)\and(Q\to R))\to(P\to R)     where   P   P   P   ,   Q   Q   Q   , and   R   R   R   are propositions expressed in some formal system .
