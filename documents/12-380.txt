Ordinal collapsing function

In mathematical logic and set theory, an ordinal collapsing function (or projection function) is a technique for defining (notations for) certain recursive large countable ordinals, whose principle is to give names to certain ordinals much larger than the one being defined, perhaps even large cardinals (though they can be replaced with recursively large ordinals at the cost of extra technical difficulty), and then “collapse” them down to a system of notations for the sought-after ordinal. For this reason, ordinal collapsing functions are described as an impredicative manner of naming ordinals.
The details of the definition of ordinal collapsing functions vary, and get more complicated as greater ordinals are being defined, but the typical idea is that whenever the notation system “runs out of fuel” and cannot name a certain ordinal, a much larger ordinal is brought “from above” to give a name to that critical point. An example of how this works will be detailed below, for an ordinal collapsing function defining the Bachmann-Howard ordinal (i.e., defining a system of notations up to the Bachmann-Howard ordinal).
The use and definition of ordinal collapsing functions is inextricably intertwined with the theory of ordinal analysis, since the large countable ordinals defined and denoted by a given collapse are used to describe the ordinal-theoretic strength of certain formal systems, typically12 subsystems of analysis (such as those seen in the light of reverse mathematics), extensions of Kripke-Platek set theory, Bishop-style systems of constructive mathematics or Martin-Löf-style systems of intuitionistic type theory.
Ordinal collapsing functions are typically denoted using some variation of the Greek letter 
 
 
 
  (psi).
An example leading up to the Bachmann-Howard ordinal
The choice of the ordinal collapsing function given as example below imitates greatly the system introduced by Buchholz3 but is limited to collapsing one cardinal for clarity of exposition. More on the relation between this example and Buchholz's system will be said below.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  stand for the first uncountable ordinal

 
 
 , or, in fact, any ordinal which is (an 
 
 
 
 -number and) guaranteed to be greater than all the countable ordinals which will be constructed (for example, the Church-Kleene ordinal is adequate for our purposes; but we will work with 
 
 
 
  because it allows the convenient use of the word countable in the definitions).
We define a function 
 
 
 
  (which will be non-decreasing and continuous), taking an arbitrary ordinal 
 
 
 
  to a countable ordinal 
 
 
 
 
 , recursively on 
 
 
 
 , as follows:

Assume 
 
 
 
  has been defined for all 
 
 
 
 , and we wish to define 
 
 
 
 .
 


Let 
 
 
 
 
  be the set of ordinals generated starting from 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  by recursively applying the following functions: ordinal addition, multiplication and exponentiation and the function 
 
 
 
 
 , i.e., the restriction of 
 
 
 
  to ordinals 
 
 
 
 . (Formally, we define 
 
 
 
  and inductively 
 
 
 
  for all natural numbers 
 
 
 
 
  and we let 
 
 
 
  be the union of the 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .)
 


Then 
 
 
 
  is defined as the smallest ordinal not belonging to 
 
 
 
 
 .
 

In a more concise (although more obscure) way:


 
  is the smallest ordinal which cannot be expressed from 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  using sums, products, exponentials, and the 
 
 
 
  function itself (to previously constructed ordinals less than 
 
 
 
 ).
Here is an attempt to explain the motivation for the definition of 
 
 
 
  in intuitive terms: since the usual operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation are not sufficient to designate ordinals very far, we attempt to systematically create new names for ordinals by taking the first one which does not have a name yet, and whenever we run out of names, rather than invent them in an ad hoc fashion or using diagonal schemes, we seek them in the ordinals far beyond the ones we are constructing (beyond 
 
 
 
 , that is); so we give names to uncountable ordinals and, since in the end the list of names is necessarily countable, 
 
 
 
 
  will “collapse” them to countable ordinals.
Computation of values of 
 
 

To clarify how the function 
 
 
 
  is able to produce notations for certain ordinals, we now compute its first values.
Predicative start
First consider 
 
 
 
 . It contains ordinals 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and so on. It also contains such ordinals as 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 . The first ordinal which it does not contain is 

 (which is the limit of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and so on — less than 
 
 
 
 
  by assumption). The upper bound of the ordinals it contains is 
 
 
 
  (the limit of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and so on), but that is not so important. This shows that 
 
 
 
 
 .
Similarly, 
 
 
 
  contains the ordinals which can be formed from 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  and this time also 
 
 
 
 , using addition, multiplication and exponentiation. This contains all the ordinals up to 
 
 
 
  but not the latter, so 
 
 
 
 . In this manner, we prove that 
 
 
 
  inductively on 
 
 
 
 
 : the proof works, however, only as long as 
 
 
 
 . We therefore have:


 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the smallest fixed point of 
 
 
 
 
 .
(Here, the 
 
 
 
  functions are the Veblen functions defined starting with 
 
 
 
 .)
Now 
 
 
 
  but 
 
 
 
  is no larger, since 
 
 
 
 
  cannot be constructed using finite applications of 
 
 
 
  and thus never belongs to a 
 
 
 
  set for 
 
 
 
 , and the function 
 
 
 
  remains “stuck” at 
 
 
 
 
  for some time:


 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
First impredicative values
Again, 
 
 
 
 . However, when we come to computing 
 
 
 
 , something has changed: since 
 
 
 
 
  was (“artificially”) added to all the 
 
 
 
 , we are permitted to take the value 
 
 
 
  in the process. So 
 
 
 
  contains all ordinals which can be built from 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , the 
 
 
 
  function up to 
 
 
 and this time also 
 
 
 
 
  itself, using addition, multiplication and exponentiation. The smallest ordinal not in 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  (the smallest 
 
 
 
 -number after 
 
 
 
 ).
We say that the definition 
 
 
 
 
  and the next values of the function 
 
 
 
  such as 
 
 
 
  are impredicative because they use ordinals (here, 
 
 
 
 ) greater than the ones which are being defined (here, 
 
 
 
 ).
Values of 
 
 
 
 
  up to the Feferman-Schütte ordinal
The fact that 
 
 
 
  remains true for all 
 
 
 
  (note, in particular, that 
 
 
 
 : but since now the ordinal 
 
 
 
  has been constructed there is nothing to prevent from going beyond this). However, at 
 
 
 
 
  (the first fixed point of 
 
 
 
  beyond 
 
 
 
 ), the construction stops again, because 
 
 
 
  cannot be constructed from smaller ordinals and 
 
 
 
  by finitely applying the 
 
 
 
 
  function. So we have 
 
 
 
 .
The same reasoning shows that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  enumerates the fixed points of 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the first fixed point of 
 
 
 
 . We then have 
 
 
 
 .
Again, we can see that 
 
 
 
  for some time: this remains true until the first fixed point 
 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , which is the Feferman-Schütte ordinal. Thus, 
 
 
 
  is the Feferman-Schütte ordinal.
Beyond the Feferman-Schütte ordinal
We have 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is the next fixed point of 
 
 
 
 . So, if 
 
 
 
  enumerates the fixed points in question (which can also be noted 
 
 
 
  using the many-valued Veblen functions) we have 
 
 
 
 , until the first fixed point 
 
 
 
 
  of the 
 
 
 
  itself, which will be 
 
 
 
  (and the first fixed point 
 
 
 
  of the 
 
 
 
  functions will be 
 
 
 
 
 ). In this manner:



 
  is the Ackermann ordinal (the range of the notation 
 
 
 
  defined predicatively),


 
  is the “small” Veblen ordinal (the range of the notations 
 
 
 
  predicatively using finitely many variables),


 
 
  is the “large” Veblen ordinal (the range of the notations 
 
 
 
  predicatively using transfinitely-but-predicatively-many variables),
the limit 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , etc., is the Bachmann-Howard ordinal: after this our function 
 
 
 
  is constant, and we can go no further with the definition we have given.

Ordinal notations up to the Bachmann-Howard ordinal
We now explain more systematically how the 
 
 
 
  function defines notations for ordinals up to the Bachmann-Howard ordinal.
A note about base representations
Recall that if 
 
 
 
  is an ordinal which is a power of 
 
 
 
  (for example 
 
 
 
 
  itself, or 
 
 
 
 , or 
 
 
 
 ), any ordinal 
 
 
 
  can be uniquely expressed in the form 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  is a natural number, 
 
 
 
  are non-zero ordinals less than 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are ordinal numbers (we allow 
 
 
 
 ). This “base 
 
 
 
 
  representation” is an obvious generalization of the Cantor normal form (which is the case 
 
 
 
 ). Of course, it may quite well be that the expression is uninteresting, i.e., 
 
 
 
 , but in any other case the 
 
 
 
  must all be less than 
 
 
 
 ; it may also be the case that the expression is trivial (i.e., 
 
 
 
 
 , in which case 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ).
If 
 
 
 
  is an ordinal less than 
 
 
 
 , then its base 
 
 
 
 
  representation has coefficients 
 
 
 
  (by definition) and exponents 
 
 
 
  (because of the assumption 
 
 
 
 ): hence one can rewrite these exponents in base 
 
 
 
  and repeat the operation until the process terminates (any decreasing sequence of ordinals is finite). We call the resulting expression the iterated base 
 
 
 
 
  representation of 
 
 
 
  and the various coefficients involved (including as exponents) the pieces of the representation (they are all 
Some properties of 
 
 


The function 
 
 
 
 
  is non-decreasing and continuous (this is more or less obvious from its definition).
If 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  then necessarily 
 
 
 
 . Indeed, no ordinal 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 
  can belong to 
 
 
 
  (otherwise its image by 
 
 
 
 , which is 
 
 
 
  would belong to 
 
 
 
  — impossible); so 
 
 
 
 
  is closed by everything under which 
 
 
 
  is the closure, so they are equal.
Any value 
 
 
 
  taken by 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
 -number (i.e., a fixed point of 
 
 
 
 
 ). Indeed, if it were not, then by writing it in Cantor normal form, it could be expressed using sums, products and exponentiation from elements less than it, hence in 
 
 
 
 , so it would be in 
 
 
 
 , a contradiction.
Lemma: Assume 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
 -number and 
 
 
 
 
  an ordinal such that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 : then the 
 
 
 
 -pieces (defined above) of any element of 
 
 
 
  are less than 
 
 
 
 
 . Indeed, let 
 
 
 
  be the set of ordinals all of whose 
 
 
 
 -pieces are less than 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is closed under addition, multiplication and exponentiation (because 
 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
 -number, so ordinals less than it are closed under addition, multiplication and exponentiation). And 
 
 
 
  also contains every 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  by assumption, and it contains 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . So 
 
 
 
 , which was to be shown.
Under the hypothesis of the previous lemma, 
 
 
 
 
  (indeed, the lemma shows that 
 
 
 
 ).
Any 
 
 
 
 -number less than some element in the range of 
 
 
 
  is itself in the range of 
 
 
 
  (that is, 
 
 
 
 
  omits no 
 
 
 
 -number). Indeed: if 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
 -number not greater than the range of 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
 
  be the least upper bound of the 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 : then by the above we have 
 
 
 
 , but 
 
 
 
  would contradict the fact that 
 
 
 
 
  is the least upper bound — so 
 
 
 
 .
Whenever 
 
 
 
 , the set 
 
 
 
  consists exactly of those ordinals 
 
 
 
  (less than 
 
 
 
 
 ) all of whose 
 
 
 
 -pieces are less than 
 
 
 
 . Indeed, we know that all ordinals less than 
 
 
 
 , hence all ordinals (less than 
 
 
 
 ) whose 
 
 
 
 
 -pieces are less than 
 
 
 
 , are in 
 
 
 
 . Conversely, if we assume 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  (in other words if 
 
 
 
 
  is the least possible with 
 
 
 
 ), the lemma gives the desired property. On the other hand, if 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 , then we have already remarked 
 
 
 
  and we can replace 
 
 
 
 
  by the least possible with 
 
 
 
 .

The ordinal notation
Using the facts above, we can define a (canonical) ordinal notation for every 
 
 
 
  less than the Bachmann-Howard ordinal. We do this by induction on 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is less than 
 
 
 
 
 , we use the iterated Cantor normal form of 
 
 
 
 . Otherwise, there exists a largest 
 
 
 
 -number 
 
 
 
  less or equal to 
 
 
 
  (this is because the set of 
 
 
 
 
 -numbers is closed): if 
 
 
 
  then by induction we have defined a notation for 
 
 
 
  and the base 
 
 
 
  representation of 
 
 
 
  gives one for 
 
 
 
 
 , so we are finished.
It remains to deal with the case where 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
 -number: we have argued that, in this case, we can write 
 
 
 
  for some (possibly uncountable) ordinal 
 
 
 
 : let 
 
 
 
 
  be the greatest possible such ordinal (which exists since 
 
 
 
  is continuous). We use the iterated base 
 
 
 
  representation of 
 
 
 
 : it remains to show that every piece of this representation is less than 
 
 
 
  (so we have already defined a notation for it). If this is not the case then, by the properties we have shown, 
 
 
 
 
  does not contain 
 
 
 
 ; but then 
 
 
 
  (they are closed under the same operations, since the value of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
  can never be taken), so 
 
 
 
 
 , contradicting the maximality of 
 
 
 
 .
Note: Actually, we have defined canonical notations not just for ordinals below the Bachmann-Howard ordinal but also for certain uncountable ordinals, namely those whose 
 
 
 
 -pieces are less than the Bachmann-Howard ordinal (viz.: write them in iterated base 
 
 
 
  representation and use the canonical representation for every piece). This canonical notation is used for arguments of the 
 
 
 
  function (which may be uncountable).
Examples
For ordinals less than 
 
 
 
 
 , the canonical ordinal notation defined coincides with the iterated Cantor normal form (by definition).
For ordinals less than 
 
 
 
 , the notation coincides with iterated base 
 
 
 
  notation (the pieces being themselves written in iterated Cantor normal form): e.g., 
 
 
 
  will be written 
 
 
 
 , or, more accurately, 
 
 
 
 
 . For ordinals less than 
 
 
 
 , we similarly write in iterated base 
 
 
 
  and then write the pieces in iterated base 
 
 
 
  (and write the pieces of that in iterated Cantor normal form): so 
 
 
 
  is written 
 
 
 
 
 , or, more accurately, 
 
 
 
 . Thus, up to 
 
 
 
 , we always use the largest possible 
 
 
 
 -number base which gives a non-trivial representation.
Beyond this, we may need to express ordinals beyond 
 
 
 
 : this is always done in iterated 
 
 
 
 
 -base, and the pieces themselves need to be expressed using the largest possible 
 
 
 
 -number base which gives a non-trivial representation.
Note that while 
 
 
 
  is equal to the Bachmann-Howard ordinal, this is not a “canonical notation” in the sense we have defined (canonical notations are defined only for ordinals less than the Bachmann-Howard ordinal).
Conditions for canonicalness
The notations thus defined have the property that whenever they nest 
 
 
 
  functions, the arguments of the “inner” 
 
 
 
  function are always less than those of the “outer” one (this is a consequence of the fact that the 
 
 
 
 
 -pieces of 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the largest possible such that 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 -number 
 
 
 
 
 , are all less than 
 
 
 
 , as we have shown above). For example, 
 
 
 
  does not occur as a notation: it is a well-defined expression (and it is equal to 
 
 
 
  since 
 
 
 
  is constant between 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ), but it is not a notation produced by the inductive algorithm we have outlined.
Canonicalness can be checked recursively: an expression is canonical if and only if it is either the iterated Cantor normal form of an ordinal less than 
 
 
 
 , or an iterated base 
 
 
 
  representation all of whose pieces are canonical, for some 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is itself written in iterated base 
 
 
 
  representation all of whose pieces are canonical and less than 
 
 
 
 . The order is checked by lexicographic verification at all levels (keeping in mind that 
 
 
 
  is greater than any expression obtained by 
 
 
 
 , and for canonical values the greater 
 
 
 
 
  always trumps the lesser or even arbitrary sums, products and exponentials of the lesser).
For example, 
 
 
 
  is a canonical notation for an ordinal which is less than the Feferman-Schütte ordinal: it can be written using the Veblen functions as 
 
 
 
 .
Concerning the order, one might point out that 
 
 
 
  (the Feferman-Schütte ordinal) is much more than 
 
 
 
  (because 
 
 
 
 
  is greater than 
 
 
 
  of anything), and 
 
 
 
  is itself much more than 
 
 
 
  (because 
 
 
 
  is greater than 
 
 
 
 
 , so any sum-product-or-exponential expression involving 
 
 
 
  and smaller value will remain less than 
 
 
 
 ). In fact, 
 
 
 
  is already less than 
 
 
 
 .
Standard sequences for ordinal notations
To witness the fact that we have defined notations for ordinals below the Bachmann-Howard ordinal (which are all of countable cofinality), we might define standard sequences converging to any one of them (provided it is a limit ordinal, of course). Actually we will define canonical sequences for certain uncountable ordinals, too, namely the uncountable ordinals of countable cofinality (if we are to hope to define a sequence converging to them…) which are representable (that is, all of whose 
 
 
 
 
 -pieces are less than the Bachmann-Howard ordinal).
The following rules are more or less obvious, except for the last:

First, get rid of the (iterated) base 
 
 
 
  representations: to define a standard sequence converging to 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 
  (or 
 
 
 
 , but see below):
 
if 
 
 
 
  is zero then 
 
 
 
  and there is nothing to be done;
if 
 
 
 
  is zero and 
 
 
 
 
  is successor, then 
 
 
 
  is successor and there is nothing to be done;
if 
 
 
 
  is limit, take the standard sequence converging to 
 
 
 
  and replace 
 
 
 
  in the expression by the elements of that sequence;
if 
 
 
 
 
  is successor and 
 
 
 
  is limit, rewrite the last term 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
  and replace the exponent 
 
 
 
  in the last term by the elements of the fundamental sequence converging to it;
if 
 
 
 
 
  is successor and 
 
 
 
  is also, rewrite the last term 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
  and replace the last 
 
 
 
  in this expression by the elements of the fundamental sequence converging to it.

If 
 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , then take the obvious 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 … as the fundamental sequence for 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  then take as fundamental sequence for 
 
 
 
  the sequence 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 …
If 
 
 
 
  then take as fundamental sequence for 
 
 
 
  the sequence 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 …
If 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a limit ordinal of countable cofinality, define the standard sequence for 
 
 
 
  to be obtained by applying 
 
 
 
 
  to the standard sequence for 
 
 
 
  (recall that 
 
 
 
  is continuous, here).
It remains to handle the case where 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  an ordinal of uncountable cofinality (e.g., 
 
 
 
 
  itself). Obviously it doesn't make sense to define a sequence converging to 
 
 
 
  in this case; however, what we can define is a sequence converging to some 
 
 
 
  with countable cofinality and such that 
 
 
 
  is constant between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 . This 
 
 
 
  will be the first fixed point of a certain (continuous and non-decreasing) function 
 
 
 
 . To find it, apply the same rules (from the base 
 
 
 
  representation of 
 
 
 
 ) as to find the canonical sequence of 
 
 
 
 
 , except that whenever a sequence converging to 
 
 
 
  is called for (something which cannot exist), replace the 
 
 
 
  in question, in the expression of 
 
 
 
 , by a 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
 
  is a variable) and perform a repeated iteration (starting from 
 
 
 
 , say) of the function 
 
 
 
 : this gives a sequence 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 … tending to 
 
 
 
 , and the canonical sequence for 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 … (The examples below should make this clearer.)

Here are some examples for the last (and most interesting) case:

The canonical sequence for 
 
 
 
  is
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 … This indeed converges to 
 
 
 
 
  after which 
 
 
 
  is constant until 
 
 
 
 .
The canonical sequence for 
 
 
 
  is
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 ,

Even though the Bachmann-Howard ordinal

A terminating process
Start with any ordinal less or equal to the Bachmann-Howard ordinal, and repeat the following process so long as it is not zero:

if the ordinal is a successor, subtract one (that is, replace it with its predecessor),
if it is a limit, replace it by some element of the canonical sequence defined for it.

Then it is true that this process always terminates (as any decreasing sequence of ordinals is finite); however, like (but even more so than for) the hydra game:

it can take a very long time to terminate,
the proof of termination may be out of reach of certain weak systems of arithmetic.

To give some flavor of what the process feels like, here are some steps of it: starting from 
 
 
 
  (the small Veblen ordinal), we might go down to 
 
 
 
 , from there down to 
 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  and so on. It appears as though the expressions are getting more and more complicated whereas, in fact, the ordinals always decrease.
Concerning the first statement, one could introduce, for any ordinal 
 
 
 
  less or equal to the Bachmann-Howard ordinal 
 
 
 
 , the integer function 
 
 
 
  which counts the number of steps of the process before termination if one always selects the 
 
 
 
 
 'th element from the canonical sequence. Then 
 
 
 
  can be a very fast growing function: already 
 
 
 
  is essentially 
 
 
 
 , the function 
 
 
 
  is comparable with the Ackermann function

 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is quite unimaginable.
Concerning the second statement, a precise version is given by ordinal analysis: for example, Kripke-Platek set theory can prove4 that the process terminates for any given 
 
 
 
  less than the Bachmann-Howard ordinal, but it cannot do this uniformly, i.e., it cannot prove the termination starting from the Bachmann-Howard ordinal. Some theories like Peano arithmetic are limited by much smaller ordinals (
 
 
 
  in the case of Peano arithmetic).
Variations on the example
Making the function less powerful
It is instructive (although not exactly useful) to make 
 
 
 
  less powerful.
If we alter the definition of 
 
 
 
 
  above to omit exponentiation from the repertoire from which 
 
 
 
  is constructed, then we get 
 
 
 
  (as this is the smallest ordinal which cannot be constructed from 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  using addition and multiplication only), then 
 
 
 
  and similarly 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  until we come to a fixed point which is then our 
 
 
 
 . We then have 
 
 
 
 
  and so on until 
 
 
 
 . Since multiplication of 
 
 
 
 's is permitted, we can still form 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and so on, but our construction ends there as there is no way to get at or beyond 
 
 
 
 
 : so the range of this weakened system of notation is 
 
 
 
  (the value of 
 
 
 
  is the same in our weaker system as in our original system, except that now we cannot go beyond it). This does not even go as far as the Feferman-Schütte ordinal.
If we alter the definition of 
 
 
 
  yet some more to allow only addition as a primitive for construction, we get 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  and so on until 
 
 
 
  and still 
 
 
 
 . This time, 
 
 
 
  and so on until 
 
 
 
  and similarly 
 
 
 
 
 . But this time we can go no further: since we can only add 
 
 
 
 's, the range of our system is 
 
 
 
 .
In both cases, we find that the limitation on the weakened 
 
 
 
  function comes not so much from the operations allowed on the countable ordinals as on the uncountable ordinals we allow ourselves to denote.
Going beyond the Bachmann-Howard ordinal
We know that 
 
 
 
  is the Bachmann-Howard ordinal. The reason why 
 
 
 
 
  is no larger, with our definitions, is that there is no notation for 
 
 
 
  (it does not belong to 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
 , it is always the least upper bound of it). One could try to add the 
 
 
 
  function (or the Veblen functions of so-many-variables) to the allowed primitives beyond addition, multiplication and exponentiation, but that does not get us very far. To create more systematic notations for countable ordinals, we need more systematic notations for uncountable ordinals: we cannot use the 
 
 
 
 
  function itself because it only yields countable ordinals (e.g., 
 
 
 
  is, 
 
 
 
 , certainly not 
 
 
 
 ), so the idea is to mimic its definition as follows:

Let 
 
 
 
  be the smallest ordinal which cannot be expressed from all countable ordinals, 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  using sums, products, exponentials, and the 
 
 
 
  function itself (to previously constructed ordinals less than 
 
 
 
 ).
 

Here, 
 
 
 
  is a new ordinal guaranteed to be greater than all the ordinals which will be constructed using 
 
 
 
 
 : again, letting 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  works.
For example, 
 
 
 
 , and more generally 
 
 
 
  for all countable ordinals and even beyond (
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ): this holds up to the first fixed point 
 
 
 
  beyond 
 
 
 
  of the 
 
 
 
  function, which is the limit of 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and so forth. Beyond this, we have 
 
 
 
  and this remains true until 
 
 
 
 : exactly as was the case for 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The 
 
 
 
  function gives us a system of notations (assuming we can somehow write down all countable ordinals!) for the uncountable ordinals below 
 
 
 
 , which is the limit of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  and so forth.
Now we can reinject these notations in the original 
 
 
 
  function, modified as follows:


 
  is the smallest ordinal which cannot be expressed from 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  using sums, products, exponentials, the 
 
 
 
  function, and the 
 
 
 
  function itself (to previously constructed ordinals less than 
 
 
 
 
 ).
This modified function 
 
 
 
  coincides with the previous one up to (and including) 
 
 
 
  — which is the Bachmann-Howard ordinal. But now we can get beyond this, and 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  (the next 
 
 
 
 
 -number after the Bachmann-Howard ordinal). We have made our system doubly impredicative: to create notations for countable ordinals we use notations for certain ordinals between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  which are themselves defined using certain ordinals beyond 
 
 
 
 .
A variation on this scheme, which makes little difference when using just two (or finitely many) collapsing functions, but becomes important for infinitely many of them, is to define


 
  is the smallest ordinal which cannot be expressed from 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  using sums, products, exponentials, and the 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  function (to previously constructed ordinals less than 
 
 
 
 ). i.e., allow the use of 
 
 
 
  only for arguments less than 
 
 
 
  itself. With this definition, we must write 
 
 
 
 
  instead of 
 
 
 
  (although it is still also equal to 
 
 
 
 , of course, but it is now constant until 
 
 
 
 ). This change is inessential because, intuitively speaking, the 
 
 
 
  function collapses the nameable ordinals beyond 
 
 
 
 
  below the latter so it matters little whether 
 
 
 
  is invoked directly on the ordinals beyond 
 
 
 
  or on their image by 
 
 
 
 . But it makes it possible to define 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  by simultaneous (rather than “downward”) induction, and this is important if we are to use infinitely many collapsing functions.
Indeed, there is no reason to stop at two levels: using 
 
 
 
  new cardinals in this way, 
 
 
 
 , we get a system essentially equivalent to that introduced by Buchholz,5 the inessential difference being that since Buchholz uses 
 
 
 
  ordinals from the start, he does not need to allow multiplication or exponentiation; also, Buchholz does not introduce the numbers 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 
  in the system as they will also be produced by the 
 
 
 
  functions: this makes the entire scheme much more elegant and more concise to define, albeit more difficult to understand. This system is also sensibly equivalent to the earlier (and much more difficult to grasp) “ordinal diagrams” of Takeuti6 and 
 
 
 
  functions of Feferman: their range is the same (
 
 
 
 , which could be called the Takeuti-Feferman-Buchholz ordinal, and which describes the strength of 

 
 -comprehension plus bar induction).
A "normal" variant
Most definitions of ordinal collapsing functions found in the recent literature differ from the ones we have given in one technical but important way which makes them technically more convenient although intuitively less transparent. We now explain this.
The following definition (by induction on 
 
 
 
 
 ) is completely equivalent to that of the function 
 
 
above:

Let 
 
 
 
  be the set of ordinals generated starting from 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and all ordinals less than 
 
 
 
  by recursively applying the following functions: ordinal addition, multiplication and exponentiation, and the function 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is defined as the smallest ordinal 
 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
 

(This is equivalent, because if 
 
 
 
  is the smallest ordinal not in 
 
 
 
 , which is how we originally defined 
 
 
 
 , then it is also the smallest ordinal not in 
 
 
 
 
 , and furthermore the properties we described of 
 
 
 
  imply that no ordinal between 
 
 
 
  inclusive and 
 
 
 
  exclusive belongs to 
 
 
 
 .)
We can now make a change to the definition which makes it subtly different:

Let 
 
 
 
 
  be the set of ordinals generated starting from 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and all ordinals less than 
 
 
 
 
  by recursively applying the following functions: ordinal addition, multiplication and exponentiation, and the function 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is defined as the smallest ordinal 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 .
 

The first values of 
 
 
 
  coincide with those of 
 
 
 
 : namely, for all 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
 
  because the additional clause 
 
 
 
  is always satisfied. But at this point the functions start to differ: while the function 
 
 
 
  gets “stuck” at 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , the function 
 
 
 
 
  satisfies 
 
 
 
  because the new condition 
 
 
 
  imposes 
 
 
 
 . On the other hand, we still have 
 
 
 
  (because 
 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  so the extra condition does not come in play). Note in particular that 
 
 
 
 , unlike 
 
 
 
 , is not monotonic, nor is it continuous.
Despite these changes, the 
 
 
 
  function also defines a system of ordinal notations up to the Bachmann-Howard ordinal: the notations, and the conditions for canonicalness, are slightly different (for example, 
 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  less than the common value 
 
 
 
 ).
Collapsing large cardinals
As noted in the introduction, the use and definition of ordinal collapsing functions is strongly connected with the theory of ordinal analysis, so the collapse of this or that large cardinal must be mentioned simultaneously with the theory for which it provides a proof-theoretic analysis.

Gerhard Jäger and Wolfram Pohlers7 described the collapse of an inaccessible cardinal to describe the ordinal-theoretic strength of Kripke-Platek set theory augmented by the recursive inaccessibility of the class of ordinals (KPi), which is also proof-theoretically equivalent8 to 
 
 
 
 -comprehension plus bar induction. Roughly speaking, this collapse can be obtained by adding the 
 
 
 
  function itself to the list of constructions to which the 
 
 
 
 
  collapsing system applies.
Michael Rathjen9 then described the collapse of a Mahlo cardinal to describe the ordinal-theoretic strength of Kripke-Platek set theory augmented by the recursive mahloness of the class of ordinals (KPM).
The same author10 later described the collapse of a weakly compact cardinal to describe the ordinal-theoretic strength of Kripke-Platek set theory augmented by certain reflection principles (concentrating on the case of 
 
 
 
 -reflection). Very roughly speaking, this proceeds by introducing the first cardinal 
 
 
 
  which is 
 
 
 
 -hyper-Mahlo and adding the 
 
 
 
  function itself to the collapsing system.
Even more recently, the same author has begun11 the investigation of the collapse of yet larger cardinals, with the ultimate goal of achieving an ordinal analysis of 
 
 
 
 
 -comprehension (which is proof-theoretically equivalent to the augmentation of Kripke-Platek by 
 
 
 
 -separation).
