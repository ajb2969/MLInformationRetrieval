   5'-acylphosphoadenosine hydrolase      5'-acylphosphoadenosine hydrolase   In enzymology , a 5'-acylphosphoadenosine hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5'-acylphosphoadenosine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + a carboxylate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5'-acylphosphoadenosine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are AMP and carboxylate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5'-acylphosphoadenosine acylhydrolase . This enzyme is also called 5-phosphoadenosine hydrolase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .
