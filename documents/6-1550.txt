   Enol ether      Enol ether   An enol ether is an alkene with an alkoxy  substituent . 1 The general structure is      R  1    R  2   C   =    C   R  3    -  O  -   R  4           subscript  R  1    subscript  R  2   C       C   subscript  R  3    O   subscript  R  4      R_{1}R_{2}C=CR_{3}-O-R_{4}   with R an alkyl or an aryl group. Enol ethers and enamines are so-called activated alkenes or electron rich alkenes because the oxygen atom donates electrons to the double bond by forming a resonance structure with the corresponding oxonium ion . This property makes them reactive substrates in certain organic reactions such as the Diels-Alder reaction . An enol ether can be considered the ether of the corresponding enolate , hence the name. Two simple enol ethers are methyl vinyl ether and 2,3-dihydrofuran .  See also   Silyl enol ether   References  "  Category:Functional groups     â†©
