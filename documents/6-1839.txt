Corrected fuel flow

Corrected fuel flow is the fuel flow that is required by an engine if the freestream total head conditions are equivalent to ambient conditions at Sea Level on a Standard Day (i.e. 14.696 lb/in², 288.15K ).
Corrected Fuel Flow can be calculated as follows, assuming Imperial units:






So-called Non-Dimensional Fuel Flow 

 
 ) is proportional to Corrected Fuel Flow:






Corrected Fuel Flow (or Non-Dimensional Fuel Flow) is one of several non-dimensional groups associated with gas turbine performance calculations.
The equivalent equations for Preferred SI Units are:
