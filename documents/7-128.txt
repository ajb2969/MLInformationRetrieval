   Steve Jackson (mathematician)      Steve Jackson (mathematician)   Steve Jackson (full name: Stephen Craig Jackson ) is an American set theorist at University of North Texas . Much of his most notable work has involved the descriptive set-theoretic consequences of the axiom of determinacy . In particular he is known for having calculated the values of all the projective ordinals (the suprema of the lengths of all prewellorderings of the reals at a particular level in the projective hierarchy ) under the assumption that the axiom of determinacy holds.  In recent years he has also made contributions to the theory of Borel equivalence relations . With Dan Mauldin he solved the Steinhaus lattice problem .  Jackson earned his Ph.D. in 1983 at UCLA under the direction of Donald A. Martin , with a dissertation on A Calculation of  Œ¥ 1 5 . In it, he proved that, under AD,        Œ¥  ùüì  ùüè   =   ‚Ñµ    œâ   œâ  œâ    +  1         subscript   superscript  Œ¥  1   5    subscript  normal-‚Ñµ     superscript  œâ   superscript  œâ  œâ    1      \mathbf{\delta^{1}_{5}}=\aleph_{\omega^{\omega^{\omega}}+1}      thereby solving the first Victoria Delfino problem, one of the notorious problems of the combinatorics of the axiom of determinacy .
