   2-dehydro-3-deoxygalactonokinase      2-dehydro-3-deoxygalactonokinase   In enzymology , a 2-dehydro-3-deoxygalactonokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-galactonate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-galactonate 6-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-galactonate , whereas its two products are ADP and 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-galactonate 6-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-galactonate 6-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include 2-keto-3-deoxygalactonokinase , 2-keto-3-deoxygalactonate kinase (phosphorylating) , and 2-oxo-3-deoxygalactonate kinase . This enzyme participates in galactose metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
