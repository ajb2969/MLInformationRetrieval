   Alkenylglycerophosphoethanolamine hydrolase      Alkenylglycerophosphoethanolamine hydrolase   In enzymology , an alkenylglycerophosphoethanolamine hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1-(1-alkenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   an aldehyde + sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-(1-alkenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are aldehyde and sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on ether bonds (ether hydrolases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-(1-alkenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine aldehydohydrolase . This enzyme participates in ether lipid metabolism .
