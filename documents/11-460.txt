Chondro-4-sulfatase

In enzymology, a chondro-4-sulfatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-deoxy-beta-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl-(1,3)-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine 4-sulfate + H2O 
 
 
 
  4-deoxy-beta-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl-(1,3)-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine + sulfate
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 4-deoxy-beta-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl-(1,3)-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, 4-sulfate, and H2O, whereas its two products are 4-deoxy-beta-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl-(1,3)-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and sulfate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on sulfuric ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-deoxy-beta-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl-(1,3)-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-4-su lfate 4-sulfohydrolase. This enzyme is also called chondroitin-4-sulfatase.
