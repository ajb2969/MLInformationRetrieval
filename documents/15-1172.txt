Pseudobaptigenin synthase




Pseudobaptigenin synthase

Pseudobaptigenin synthase () is an enzyme with system name calycosin,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (methylenedioxy-bridge-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) calycosin + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  pseudobaptigenin + NADP+ + 2 H2O
 
(2) pratensein + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  5-hydroxypseudobaptigenin + NADP+ + 2 H2O
 

Pseudobaptigenin synthase is a heme-thiolate enzyme (P450) that catalyses a step in the biosynthesis of (-)-maackiain.
