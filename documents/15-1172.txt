   Pseudobaptigenin synthase      Pseudobaptigenin synthase   Pseudobaptigenin synthase () is an enzyme with system name calycosin,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (methylenedioxy-bridge-forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) calycosin + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pseudobaptigenin + NADP + + 2 H 2 O  (2) pratensein + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-hydroxypseudobaptigenin + NADP+ + 2 H 2 O   Pseudobaptigenin synthase is a heme - thiolate enzyme (P450) that catalyses a step in the biosynthesis of (-)- maackiain .
