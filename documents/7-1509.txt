King's graph

In graph theory, a king's graph is a graph that represents all legal moves of the king chess piece on a chessboard where each vertex represents a square on a chessboard and each edge is a legal move. More specifically, an 
 
 
 
  king's graph is a king's graph of an 
 
 
 
  chessboard.1
For a 
 
 
 
  king's graph the total number of vertices is simply 
 
 
 
 . For a 
 
 
 
  king's graph the total number of vertices is simply 
 
 
 
  and the total number of edges is 
 
 
 
 .2
The neighbourhood of a vertex in the king's graph corresponds to the Moore neighborhood for cellular automata.3 A generalization of the king's graph, called a kinggraph, is formed from a squaregraph (a planar graph in which each bounded face is a quadrilateral and each interior vertex has at least four neighbors) by adding the two diagonals of every quadrilateral face of the squaregraph.4
