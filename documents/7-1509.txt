   King's graph      King's graph   In graph theory , a king's graph is a graph that represents all legal moves of the king  chess  piece on a chessboard where each vertex represents a square on a chessboard and each edge is a legal move. More specifically, an    n  ×  m      n  m    n\times m   king's graph is a king's graph of an    n  ×  m      n  m    n\times m   chessboard. 1  For a    n  ×  m      n  m    n\times m   king's graph the total number of vertices is simply    n  m      n  m    nm   . For a    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n   king's graph the total number of vertices is simply    n  2     superscript  n  2    n^{2}   and the total number of edges is     (    2  n   -  2   )    (    2  n   -  1   )           2  n   2       2  n   1     (2n-2)(2n-1)   . 2  The neighbourhood of a vertex in the king's graph corresponds to the Moore neighborhood for cellular automata. 3 A generalization of the king's graph, called a kinggraph , is formed from a squaregraph (a planar graph in which each bounded face is a quadrilateral and each interior vertex has at least four neighbors) by adding the two diagonals of every quadrilateral face of the squaregraph. 4  References  See also   Knight's graph  Rook's graph  Lattice graph   "  Category:Mathematical chess problems  Category:Parametric families of graphs     .
