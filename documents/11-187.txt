   Crotonoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) hydratase      Crotonoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) hydratase   In enzymology , a crotonoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (3R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   but-2-enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (3R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein ], and two products , but-2-enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein ] and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (3R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydro-lyase (but-2-enoyl-[acyl-carrier protein]-forming) . Other names in common use include (3R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydro-lyase , beta-hydroxybutyryl acyl carrier protein dehydrase , beta-hydroxybutyryl acyl carrier protein (ACP) dehydrase , beta-hydroxybutyryl acyl carrier protein dehydrase , enoyl acyl carrier protein hydrase , crotonyl acyl carrier protein hydratase , 3-hydroxybutyryl acyl carrier protein dehydratase , beta-hydroxybutyryl acyl carrier , and protein dehydrase . This enzyme participates in fatty acid biosynthesis .  References      "  Category:EC 4.2.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
