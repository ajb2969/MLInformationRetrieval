   Gaussian network model      Gaussian network model   The Gaussian network model (GNM) is a representation of a biological macromolecule as an elastic mass-and- spring network to study, understand, and characterize mechanical aspects of its long-scale dynamics . The model has a wide range of applications from small proteins such as enzymes composed of a single domain , to large macromolecular assemblies such as a ribosome or a viral capsid .  The Gaussian network model is a minimalist, coarse-grained approach to study biological molecules. In the model, proteins are represented by nodes corresponding to alpha carbons of the amino acid residues. Similarly, DNA and RNA structures are represented with one to three nodes for each nucleotide . The model uses the harmonic approximation to model interactions, i.e. the spatial interactions between nodes (amino acids or nucleotides) are modeled with a uniform harmonic spring. This coarse-grained representation makes the calculations computationally inexpensive.  At molecular level, many biological phenomena, such as catalytic activity of an enzyme , occur within the range of nano- to millisecond timescales. All atom simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics , rarely reach microsecond trajectory length, depending on the size of the system and accessible computational resources. Normal mode analysis in the context of GNM or elastic network (EN) models, in general, provides insights on the longer-scale functional behaviors of macromolecules. Here, the model captures native state functional motions of a biomolecule in the cost of atomic detail. The inference obtained from this model is complementary to atomic detail simulation techniques.  Another model for protein dynamics based on elastic mass-and-spring networks is the Anisotropic Network Model .  Gaussian network model theory  (Figure)  Figure 2: Schematic representation of nodes in elastic network of GNM. Every node is connected to its spatial neighbors by uniform springs. Distance vector between two nodes, i and j , is shown by an arrow and labeled R ij . Equilibrium positions of the i th and j th nodes, R 0 i and R 0 j , are shown in xyz coordinate system. R 0 ij is the equilibrium distance between nodes i and j . Instantaneous fluctuation vectors, ΔR i and ΔR j , and instantaneous distance vector, R ij , are shown by the dashed arrows.|400px   The Gaussian network model was first proposed in 1996 by Tirion at the atomic level 1 and then one year later reconsidered at the amino-acid level by Bahar, Atilgan, Haliloglu and Erman. 2 3 The model was influenced by work of PJ Flory on polymer networks 4 and other works that utilized normal mode analysis and simplified harmonic potentials to study dynamics of proteins. 5  The elastic network  Figure 2 shows a schematic view of elastic network studied in GNM. Metal beads represent the nodes in this Gaussian network (residues of a protein) and springs represent the connections between the nodes of this network (covalent and non-covalent interactions between residues). For nodes i and j , equilibrium position vectors, R 0 i and R 0 j , equilibrium distance vector, R 0 ij , instantaneous fluctuation vectors, ΔR i and ΔR j , and instantaneous distance vector, R ij , are shown in Figure 2. Instantaneous position vectors of these nodes are defined by R i and R j . The difference between equilibrium position vector and instantaneous position vector of residue i gives the instantaneous fluctuation vector, ΔR i = R i - R 0 i . Hence, the instantaneous fluctuation vector between nodes i and j is expressed as ΔR ij = ΔR j - ΔR i = R ij - R 0 ij .  Potential of the Gaussian network  Using the harmonic potential approximation, potential energy of the network in terms of ΔR i is       V   G  N  M    =    γ  2    [    ∑   i  ,  j   N     (    Δ   R  j    -   Δ   R  i     )   2    ]    =    γ  2    [    ∑   i  ,  j   N    Δ   R  i    Γ   i  j    Δ   R  j     ]           subscript  V    G  N  M        γ  2    delimited-[]    superscript   subscript    i  j    N    superscript      normal-Δ   subscript  R  j      normal-Δ   subscript  R  i     2               γ  2    delimited-[]    superscript   subscript    i  j    N     normal-Δ   subscript  R  i    subscript  normal-Γ    i  j    normal-Δ   subscript  R  j          V_{GNM}=\frac{\gamma}{2}\left[\sum_{i,j}^{N}(\Delta R_{j}-\Delta R_{i})^{2}%

Similar to Gaussian distribution, normalized distribution for ΔX T = [ΔX 1 ΔX 2 ..... ΔX N ] around the equilibrium positions can be expressed as       p   (   Δ  X   )    =    1      (   2  π   )   N      k  B   T   γ    |   Γ   -  1    |       exp   {   -    1  2    (   Δ   X  T     (      k  B   T   γ    Γ   -  1     )    -  1    Δ  X   )     }           p    normal-Δ  X        1       superscript    2  π   N        subscript  k  B   T   γ      superscript  normal-Γ    1                1  2     normal-Δ   superscript  X  T    superscript         subscript  k  B   T   γ    superscript  normal-Γ    1       1    normal-Δ  X         p(\Delta X)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^{N}\frac{k_{B}T}{\gamma}|\Gamma^{-1}|}}\exp%

Z Y and Z Z are expressed similarly. This formulation requires inversion of the Kirchhoff matrix. In the GNM, the determinant of the Kirchhoff matrix is zero, hence calculation of its inverse requires eigenvalue decomposition . Γ −1 is constructed using the N-1 non-zero eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors. Expressions for p ( ΔY ) and p ( ΔZ ) are similar to that of p ( ΔX ). The probability distribution of all fluctuations in GNM becomes       P   (   Δ  R   )    =   p   (   Δ  X   )   p   (   Δ  Y   )   p   (   Δ  Z   )    =    1      (   2  π   )    3  N      |      k  B   T   γ    Γ   -  1     |   3       exp   {   -    3  2    (   Δ   X  T     (      k  B   T   γ    Γ   -  1     )    -  1    Δ  X   )     }             P    normal-Δ  R      p    normal-Δ  X   p    normal-Δ  Y   p    normal-Δ  Z             1       superscript    2  π     3  N     superscript           subscript  k  B   T   γ    superscript  normal-Γ    1      3              3  2     normal-Δ   superscript  X  T    superscript         subscript  k  B   T   γ    superscript  normal-Γ    1       1    normal-Δ  X          P(\Delta R)=p(\Delta X)p(\Delta Y)p(\Delta Z)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^{3N}|\frac%

 ^{-1}|^{3}}}     Expectation values of fluctuations and correlations  Based on the statistical mechanics foundations of GNM, expectation values of residue fluctuations, i 2 >, and correlations, i · ΔR j >, can be calculated. Covariance matrix for ΔX is given by  : = \int \Delta X \cdot \Delta X^T p(\Delta X)d\Delta X=\frac{k_B T}{\gamma}\Gamma^{-1}  Since,  : =  =  =\frac{1}{3}  i 2 > and i · ΔR j > follows  : = \frac{3 k_B T}{\gamma}(\Gamma^{-1})_{ii}  : = \frac{3 k_B T}{\gamma}(\Gamma^{-1})_{ij}  Mode decomposition  The GNM normal modes are found by diagonalization of the Kirchhoff matrix, Γ = UΛU T . Here, U is a unitary matrix, U T = U −1 , of the eigenvectors u i of Γ and Λ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues λ i . The frequency and shape of a mode is represented by its eigenvalue and eigenvector, respectively. Since the Kirchhoff matrix is positive semi-definite, the first eigenvalue, λ 1 , is zero and the corresponding eigenvector have all its elements equal to 1/√N. This shows that the network model is translation invariant.  Cross-correlations between residue fluctuations can be written as a sum over the N-1 nonzero modes as  : = \frac{3 k_B T}{\gamma}[U\Lambda^{-1}U^T]_{ij}=\frac{3 k_B T}{\gamma}\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}\lambda_k^{-1} [u_k u_k^T]_{ij}  It follows that, [ ΔR i · ΔR j ], the contribution of an individual mode is expressed as        [     Δ   R  i    ⋅  Δ    R  j    ]   k   =     3   k  B   T   γ    λ  k   -  1      [   u  k   ]   i     [   u  k   ]   j         subscript   delimited-[]     normal-⋅    normal-Δ   subscript  R  i    normal-Δ    subscript  R  j     k         3   subscript  k  B   T   γ    superscript   subscript  λ  k     1     subscript   delimited-[]   subscript  u  k    i    subscript   delimited-[]   subscript  u  k    j      [\Delta R_{i}\cdot\Delta R_{j}]_{k}=\frac{3k_{B}T}{\gamma}\lambda_{k}^{-1}[u_{%
 k}]_{i}[u_{k}]_{j}     where [ u k ] i is the i th element of u k .  Influence of local packing density  By definition, a diagonal element of the Kirchhoff matrix, Γ ii , is equal to the degree of a node in GNM that represents the corresponding residue’s coordination number. This number is a measure of the local packing density around a given residue. The influence of local packing density can be assessed by series expansion of Γ −1 matrix. Γ can be written as a sum of two matrices, Γ = D + O , containing diagonal elements and off-diagonal elements of Γ .   Γ −1 = ( D + O ) −1 = [ D ( I + D −1 O ) ] −1 = ( I + D −1 O ) −1 D −1 = ( I - D −1 O + ...) −1 D −1 = D −1 - D −1 O  D −1 + ...   This expression shows that local packing density makes a significant contribution to expected fluctuations of residues. 6 The terms that follow inverse of the diagonal matrix, are contributions of positional correlations to expected fluctuations.

In X-ray crystallography β-factor (or temperature factor) of each atom is a measure of mean-squared fluctuation of the native structure. In NMR experiments, this measure can be obtained by calculating root-mean-squared differences between different models. In many applications and publications, including the original articles, it has been shown that expected residue fluctuations obtained from GNM is in good agreement with the experimentally measured native state fluctuations. 7 8 The relation between b-factors, for example, and expected residue fluctuations obtained from GNM is as follows       B  i   =    8   π  2    3   <     Δ   R  i    ⋅  Δ    R  i    ≥     8   π  2    k  B   T   γ     (   Γ   -  1    )    i  i            subscript  B  i       8   superscript  π  2    3           normal-⋅    normal-Δ   subscript  R  i    normal-Δ    subscript  R  i               8   superscript  π  2    subscript  k  B   T   γ    subscript   superscript  normal-Γ    1      i  i        B_{i}=\frac{8\pi^{2}}{3}<\Delta R_{i}\cdot\Delta R_{i}>=\frac{8\pi^{2}k_{B}T}{%

Physical meanings of slow and fast modes  Diagonalization of the Kirchhoff matrix decomposes the normal modes of collective motions of the Gaussian network model of a biomolecule. The expected values of fluctuations and cross-correlations are obtained from linear combinations of fluctuations along these normal modes. The contribution of each mode is scaled with the inverse of that modes frequency. Hence, slow (low frequency) modes contribute most to the expected fluctuations. Along the few slowest modes, motions are shown to be collective and global and potentially relevant to functionality of the biomolecules [9,13,15-18]. Fast (high frequency) modes, on the other hand, describe uncorrelated motions not inducing notable changes in the structure.
