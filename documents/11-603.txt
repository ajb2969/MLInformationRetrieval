   Alpha,alpha-trehalase      Alpha,alpha-trehalase   In enzymology , an alpha,alpha-trehalase () is an enzyme with system name alpha,alpha-trehalose glucohydrolase . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyzes the chemical reaction   alpha,alpha-trehalose + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 D-glucose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are alpha,alpha-trehalose and H 2 O , whereas its product is D-glucose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha,alpha-trehalose glucohydrolase . This enzyme is also called trehalase . This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
