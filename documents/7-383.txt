   Brewster (unit)      Brewster (unit)   The brewster ( B ) is a non- SI unit used to measure the susceptibility of a material to photoelasticity , or the value of the Stress Optic Coefficient of the material. The unit has dimensions reciprocal to those of stress. One brewster is defined to be equal to    10   -  12      superscript  10    12     10^{-12}    square metres per newton (m 2 /N or 1/Pa) or    10   -  13      superscript  10    13     10^{-13}    square centimetres per dyne (cm 2 /dyn). The unit is named after David Brewster , who discovered stress-induced birefringence in 1816.  External links   Definition of the Brewster   "  Category:Non-SI metric units
