   Multiplicative character      Multiplicative character   A multiplicative character (or linear character , or simply character ) on a group G is a group homomorphism from G to the multiplicative group of a field , usually the field of complex numbers . If G is any group, then the set Ch( G ) of these morphisms forms an abelian group under pointwise multiplication.  This group is referred to as the character group of G . Sometimes only unitary characters are considered (thus the image is in the unit circle ); other such homomorphisms are then called quasi-characters . Dirichlet characters can be seen as a special case of this definition.  Multiplicative characters are linearly independent , i.e. if     χ  1   ,   χ  2   ,  …  ,   χ  n       subscript  χ  1    subscript  χ  2   normal-…   subscript  χ  n     \chi_{1},\chi_{2},\ldots,\chi_{n}   are different characters on a group G then from       a  1    χ  1    +    a  2    χ  2    +  ⋯  +    a  n    χ  n     =  0           subscript  a  1    subscript  χ  1       subscript  a  2    subscript  χ  2    normal-⋯     subscript  a  n    subscript  χ  n     0    a_{1}\chi_{1}+a_{2}\chi_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}\chi_{n}=0   it follows that     a  1   =   a  2   =  ⋯  =   a  n   =  0         subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2        normal-⋯        subscript  a  n        0     a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}=0   .  Examples   Consider the ( ax + b )-group          G  :=   {    (     a    b      0    1     )    |    a  >  0   ,   b  ∈  𝐑    }    .     assign  G   conditional-set    a  b    0  1     formulae-sequence    a  0     b  𝐑       G:=\left\{\left.\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 0&1\end{pmatrix}\ \right|\ a>0,\ b\in\mathbf{R}\right\}.       Functions f u : G → C such that f_u \left(\begin{pmatrix}   a & b \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}\right)=a^u, where u ranges over complex numbers C are multiplicative characters.   Consider the multiplicative group of positive real numbers ( R + ,·). Then functions f u : ( R + ,·) → C such that f u ( a ) = a u , where a is an element of ( R + , ·) and u ranges over complex numbers C , are multiplicative characters.   "  Category:Group theory
