Pentagonal rotunda

In geometry, the pentagonal rotunda is one of the Johnson solids (J6). It can be seen as half an icosidodecahedron.
Formulae
The following formulae for volume, surface area, circumradius and height can be used if all faces are regular, with edge length a:1





Dual polyhedron
The dual of the pentagonal rotunda has 20 faces: 10 triangular, 5 rhombic, and 5 kites.
