7-epi-sesquithujene synthase

7-epi-sesquithujene synthase (, TPS4-B73) is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (7-epi-sesquithujene-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  7-epi-sesquithujene + diphosphate


The enzyme from Zea mays, variety B73, gives mainly 7-epi-sesquithujene.
