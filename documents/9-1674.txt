   LP 944-20      LP 944-20   LP 944-20 is a dim brown dwarf of spectral class M9 located about 21 light-years from the Solar System in the constellation of Fornax . With a visual apparent magnitude of 18, 1 it has one of the dimmest visual magnitudes listed on the RECONS page.  On 15 December 1999 a flare was detected. 2  Distance  The first parallax measurement from 1996 found that LP 944-20 (designated there as BRI 0337−3535) has a relative parallax of     π  r   =   200.0  ±  4.2        subscript  π  r    plus-or-minus  200.0  4.2     \pi_{r}=200.0\pm 4.2    mas , and its correction from relative to absolute parallax (i.e. mean parallax of the reference frame stars) is     π   r  e  f    =   1.4  ±  0.3        subscript  π    r  e  f     plus-or-minus  1.4  0.3     \pi_{ref}=1.4\pm 0.3   mas. This yields an absolute parallax of      π  r   +   π   r  e  f     =   200.0  +  1.4   =  201.4           subscript  π  r    subscript  π    r  e  f       200.0  1.4        201.4     \pi_{r}+\pi_{ref}=200.0+1.4=201.4   mas, with a standard deviation (according to     σ   X  +  Y   2   =    σ  X  2   +   σ  Y  2         superscript   subscript  σ    X  Y    2      superscript   subscript  σ  X   2    superscript   subscript  σ  Y   2      \sigma_{X+Y}^{2}=\sigma_{X}^{2}+\sigma_{Y}^{2}    3 Mean and Variance of Random Variables ) of       σ   π  r   2   +   σ   π   r  e  f    2     =     4.2  2   +   0.3  2     =  4.21             superscript   subscript  σ   subscript  π  r    2    superscript   subscript  σ   subscript  π    r  e  f     2          superscript  4.2  2    superscript  0.3  2          4.21     \sqrt{\sigma_{\pi_{r}}^{2}+\sigma_{\pi_{ref}}^{2}}=\sqrt{4.2^{2}+0.3^{2}}=4.21   mas, which corresponds to a distance of pc , or ly . 4 (The same values of absolute parallax and its standard deviation are in the RECONS ' TOP100 list. 5 6  A newer parallax, published in 2013, is  mas ( pc or  ly). 7     Lithium and clouds  Observations published in 2007 showed that the atmosphere of LP 944-20 contains much lithium and that it has dusty clouds . 8  Notes    References  External links   "The 100 nearest star systems" , Research Consortium on Nearby Stars   "  Category:M-type brown dwarfs  Category:Fornax (constellation)      http://www.solstation.com/stars/lp944-20.jpg ↩   ↩  ↩  In RECONS' TOP100 older versions the standard deviation value was 4.20 mas, not 4.21 mas. ↩   {{ cite journal | title=Lithium in LP944-20 | author=Pavlenko, Ya.
