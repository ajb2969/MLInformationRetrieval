   Acetolactate decarboxylase      Acetolactate decarboxylase   In enzymology , an acetolactate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-oxobutanoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (R)-2-acetoin + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (S)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-oxobutanoate , and two products , (R)-2-acetoin and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-oxobutanoate carboxy-lyase [(R)-2-acetoin-forming] . Other names in common use include alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase , and (S)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-oxobutanoate carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism and c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
