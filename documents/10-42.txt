   Euclidean field      Euclidean field   In mathematics , a Euclidean field is an ordered field  K for which every non-negative element is a square: that is, x ≥ 0 in K implies that x = y 2 for some y in K .  Properties   Every Euclidean field is an ordered Pythagorean field , but the converse is not true. 1  If E / F is a finite extension , and E is Euclidean, then so is F . This "going-down theorem" is a consequence of the Diller–Dress theorem . 2   Examples   The real numbers  R with the usual operations and ordering form a Euclidean field.  The field of real algebraic numbers     ℝ  ∩   ℚ  ¯       ℝ   normal-¯  ℚ     \mathbb{R}\cap\mathbb{\overline{Q}}   is a Euclidean field.  The real constructible numbers , those (signed) lengths which can be constructed from a rational segment by ruler and compass constructions , form a Euclidean field. 3  The field of hyperreal numbers is a Euclidean field.   Counterexamples   The rational numbers  Q with the usual operations and ordering do not form a Euclidean field. For example, 2 is not a square in Q since the square root of 2 is irrational . 4 By the going-down result above, no algebraic number field can be Euclidean. 5  The complex numbers  C do not form a Euclidean field since they cannot be given the structure of an ordered field.   Euclidean closure  The Euclidean closure of an ordered field K is an extension of K in the quadratic closure of K which is maximal with respect to being an ordered field with an order extending that of K . 6  References       External links     "  Category:Field theory     Martin (1998) p. 89 ↩  Lam (2005) p.270 ↩  Martin (1998) pp. 35–36 ↩  Martin (1998) p. 35 ↩   Efrat (2006) p. 177 ↩
