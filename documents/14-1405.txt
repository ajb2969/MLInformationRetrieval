   Organoxenon compound      Organoxenon compound   Organoxenon compounds in organic chemistry contain carbon to xenon chemical bonds. The first organoxenon compounds were divalent, such as (C 6 F 5 ) 2 Xe. The first tetravalent organoxenon compound, [C 6 F 5 XeF 2 ][BF 4 ], was synthesized in 2004. 1 So far, more than one hundred organoxenon compounds have been researched.  Most of the organoxenon compounds are more unstable than xenon fluorides due to the high polarity . The molecular dipoles of xenon difluoride and xenon tetrafluoride are both 0 D . The early synthesized ones only contain perfluoro groups, but later some other groups were found, e.g. 2,4,6-trifluorophenyl. 2  Xe(II)  The most common bivalent organoxenon compound is C 6 F 5 XeF, which is always used as a precursor to other organoxenon compounds. Due to the instability of xenon fluoride, it is impossible to synthesize organoxenon compound by using general organic reagents . Most frequently used fluorinating agents include Cd(Ar F ) 2 (subscript "F" means fluorine-including aryl ), C 6 F 5 SiF 3 , and C 6 F 5 SiMe 3 (should be used along with fluoride).  With the use of stronger Lewis acids , such as C 6 F 5 BF 2 , ionic compounds like [RXe][Ar F BF 3 ] can be produced. Alkenyl and alkyl organoxenon compounds are prepared in this way as well, for example, C 6 F 5 XeCF=CF 2 and C 6 F 5 XeCF 3 . 3  Some typical reactions are listed below:        2   C  6    F  5   XeF   +   Cd    (    C  6    F  5    )   2     →    Xe    (    C  6    F  5    )   2    +   CdF  2    ↓        normal-→      2   subscript  normal-C  6    subscript  normal-F  5   XeF     Cd   subscript     subscript  normal-C  6    subscript  normal-F  5    2         Xe   subscript     subscript  normal-C  6    subscript  normal-F  5    2     subscript  CdF  2      normal-↓    absent     \rm\ 2C_{6}F_{5}XeF+Cd(C_{6}F_{5})_{2}\rightarrow Xe(C_{6}F_{5})_{2}+CdF_{2}\downarrow             C   6    F  5   XeF   +    Me  3   SiCN    →     C  6    F  5   XeCN   +    Me  3   SiF       normal-→       subscript  normal-C  6    subscript  normal-F  5   XeF      subscript  Me  3   SiCN         subscript  normal-C  6    subscript  normal-F  5   XeCN      subscript  Me  3   SiF      \rm\ C_{6}F_{5}XeF+Me_{3}SiCN\rightarrow C_{6}F_{5}XeCN+Me_{3}SiF           C   6    F  5   XeF  +  Cd    (  2  ,  4  ,  6  -   C  6    H  2    F  3   )   2   →  2  ,  4  ,  6  -   C  6    H  2    F  3    XeC  6    F  5   +   CdF  2   ↓     fragments   subscript  normal-C  6    subscript  normal-F  5   XeF   Cd   subscript   fragments  normal-(  2  normal-,  4  normal-,  6    subscript  normal-C  6    subscript  normal-H  2    subscript  normal-F  3   normal-)   2   normal-→  2  normal-,  4  normal-,  6    subscript  normal-C  6    subscript  normal-H  2    subscript  normal-F  3    subscript  XeC  6    subscript  normal-F  5     subscript  CdF  2   normal-↓    \rm\ C_{6}F_{5}XeF+Cd(2,4,6-C_{6}H_{2}F_{3})_{2}\rightarrow 2,4,6-C_{6}H_{2}F_%
 {3}XeC_{6}F_{5}+CdF_{2}\downarrow   The third reaction also produces (C 6 F 5 ) 2 Xe, Xe(2,4,6-C 6 H 2 F 3 ) 2 and so on.  The precursor C 6 F 5 XeF can be prepared by the reaction of trimethyl(pentaflurophenyl)silane (C 6 F 5 SiMe 3 ) and xenon difluoride . Adding fluoride to the adduct of C 6 F 5 XeF and arsenic pentafluoride is another method. 4  Xe(IV)  In 2000, Karel Lutar and Boris Žemva et al. produced an ionic compound. They treated xenon tetrafluoride and difluoro(pentaflurophenyl)borane in dichloromethane at -55 °C:         XeF   4   +    C  6    F  5    BF  2       →    CH  2    Cl  2      -    55  o   C        [    C  6    F  5    XeF  2    ]   +    BF  4  -             superscript  55  normal-o   normal-C        subscript  CH  2    subscript  Cl  2    normal-→       subscript  XeF  4      subscript  normal-C  6    subscript  normal-F  5    subscript  BF  2        superscript   delimited-[]     subscript  normal-C  6    subscript  normal-F  5    subscript  XeF  2        superscript   subscript  BF  4        \rm\ XeF_{4}+C_{6}F_{5}BF_{2}\xrightarrow[-55^{o}C]{CH_{2}Cl_{2}}[C_{6}F_{5}%
 XeF_{2}]^{+}BF_{4}^{-}     The compound is an extremely strong fluorinating agent , and it is capable of converting (C 6 F 5 ) 3 P to (C 6 F 5 ) 3 PF 2 , C 6 F 5 I to C 6 F 5 IF 2 , and iodine to iodine pentafluoride . 5  See also   Compounds of carbon with other elements in the periodic table:   References  "  Category:Xenon compounds     ↩  ↩
