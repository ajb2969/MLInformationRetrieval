   Toric section      Toric section   A toric section is an intersection of a plane with a torus , just as a conic section is the intersection of a plane with a cone . Special cases have been known since antiquity, and the general case was studied by Jean Gaston Darboux . 1  Mathematical formulae  In general, toric sections are fourth-order ( quartic ) plane curves 2 of the form         (    x  2   +   y  2    )   2   +   a   x  2    +   b   y  2    +   c  x   +   d  y   +  e   =  0.         superscript     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    2     a   superscript  x  2      b   superscript  y  2      c  x     d  y   e   0.    \left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)^{2}+ax^{2}+by^{2}+cx+dy+e=0.     Spiric sections  A special case of a toric section is the spiric section , in which the intersecting plane is parallel to the rotational symmetry axis of the torus . They were discovered by the ancient Greek geometer Perseus in roughly 150 BC. 3 Well-known examples include the hippopede and the Cassini oval and their relatives, such as the lemniscate of Bernoulli .  Villarceau circles  Another special case is the Villarceau circles , in which the intersection is a circle despite the lack of any of the obvious sorts of symmetry that would entail a circular cross-section. 4  General toric sections  More complicated figures such as an annulus can be created when the intersecting plane is perpendicular or oblique to the rotational symmetry axis.
