Acyl-CoA hydrolase




Acyl-CoA hydrolase

In enzymology, an acyl-CoA hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acyl-CoA + H2O 
 
 
 
  CoA + a carboxylate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and H2O, whereas its two products are CoA and carboxylate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA hydrolase. Other names in common use include acyl coenzyme A thioesterase, acyl-CoA thioesterase, acyl coenzyme A hydrolase, thioesterase B, thioesterase II, and acyl-CoA thioesterase.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
