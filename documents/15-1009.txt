S-equivalence

S-equivalence is an equivalence relation on the families of semistable vector bundles on an algebraic curve.
Definition
Let X be a projective curve over an algebraically closed field k. A vector bundle on X can be considered as a locally free sheaf. Every semistable locally free E on X admits a Jordan-Hölder filtration with stable subquotients, i.e.


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are locally free sheaves on X and 
 
 
 
  are stable. Although the JH-Filtration is not unique, the subquotients are, which means that 
 
 
 
 
  is unique up to isomorphism.
Two semistable locally free sheaves E and F on X are S-equivalent if gr E ≅ gr F.
