   S-equivalence      S-equivalence   S-equivalence is an equivalence relation on the families of semistable  vector bundles on an algebraic curve .  Definition  Let X be a projective curve over an algebraically closed field  k . A vector bundle on X can be considered as a locally free sheaf . Every semistable locally free E on X admits a Jordan-Hölder filtration with stable subquotients , i.e.      0  =   E  0   ⊆   E  1   ⊆  …  ⊆   E  n   =  E        0   subscript  E  0         subscript  E  1        normal-…        subscript  E  n        E     0=E_{0}\subseteq E_{1}\subseteq\ldots\subseteq E_{n}=E   where    E  i     subscript  E  i    E_{i}   are locally free sheaves on X and     E  i   /   E   i  -  1         subscript  E  i    subscript  E    i  1      E_{i}/E_{i-1}   are stable. Although the JH-Filtration is not unique, the subquotients are, which means that     g  r  E   =    ⊕  i     E  i   /   E   i  -  1            g  r  E     subscript  direct-sum  i      subscript  E  i    subscript  E    i  1        grE=\bigoplus_{i}E_{i}/E_{i-1}   is unique up to isomorphism.  Two semistable locally free sheaves E and F on X are S -equivalent if gr E ≅ gr F .  "  Category:Algebraic curves  Category:Vector bundles
