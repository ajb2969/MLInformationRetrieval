   Taurine-transporting ATPase      Taurine-transporting ATPase   In enzymology , a taurine-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O + taurineout   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + taurinein   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , H 2 O , and taurine , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and taurine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (taurine-importing) .  References     "  Category:EC 3.6.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
