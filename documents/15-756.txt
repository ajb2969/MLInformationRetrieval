Order unit

An order unit is an element of an ordered vector space which can be used to bound all elements from above.1 In this way (as seen in the first example below) the order unit generalizes the unit element in the reals.
Definition
For the ordering cone 
 
 
 
  in the vector space

 
 , the element 
 
 
 
  is an order unit (more precisely an 
 
 
 
 -order unit) if for every 
 
 
 
  there exists a 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  (i.e. 
 
 
 
 ).2
Equivalent definition
The order units of an ordering cone 
 
 
 
  are those elements in the algebraic interior of 
 
 
 
 , i.e. given by 
 
 
 
 .3
Examples
Let 
 
 
 
  be the real numbers and 
 
 
 
 , then the unit element 
 
 
 
  is an order unit.
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then the unit element 
 
 
 
  is an order unit.
