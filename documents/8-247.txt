Longest element of a Coxeter group

In mathematics, the longest element of a Coxeter group is the unique element of maximal length in a finite Coxeter group with respect to the chosen generating set consisting of simple reflections. It is often denoted by w0. See  and .
Properties

A Coxeter group has a longest element if and only if it is finite; "only if" is because the size of the group is bounded by the number of words of length less than or equal to the maximum.
The longest element of a Coxeter group is the unique maximal element with respect to the Bruhat order.
The longest element is an involution (has order 2
 
 
 
 ), by uniqueness of maximal length (the inverse of an element has the same length as the element).1
For any 
 
 
 
  the length satisfies

A reduced expression for the longest element is not in general unique.
In a reduced expression for the longest element, every simple reflection must occur at least once.3
If the Coxeter group is a finite Weyl group then the length of w0 is the number of the positive roots.
The open cell Bw0B in the Bruhat decomposition of a semisimple algebraic group G is dense in Zariski topology; topologically, it is the top dimensional cell of the decomposition, and represents the fundamental class.
The longest element is the central element –1 except for

  for n odd, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for p odd, when it is –1 multiplied by the order 2 automorphism of the Coxeter diagram. 4
