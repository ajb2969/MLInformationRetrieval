   Longest element of a Coxeter group      Longest element of a Coxeter group   In mathematics , the longest element of a Coxeter group is the unique element of maximal length in a finite Coxeter group with respect to the chosen generating set consisting of simple reflections. It is often denoted by w 0 . See  and .  Properties   A Coxeter group has a longest element if and only if it is finite; "only if" is because the size of the group is bounded by the number of words of length less than or equal to the maximum.  The longest element of a Coxeter group is the unique maximal element with respect to the Bruhat order .  The longest element is an involution (has order 2     w  0   -  1    =   w  0        superscript   subscript  w  0     1     subscript  w  0     w_{0}^{-1}=w_{0}   ), by uniqueness of maximal length (the inverse of an element has the same length as the element). 1  For any     w  ∈  W   ,      w  W    w\in W,   the length satisfies      ℓ   (    w  0   w   )    =    ℓ   (   w  0   )    -   ℓ   (  w  )      .        normal-ℓ     subscript  w  0   w        normal-ℓ   subscript  w  0      normal-ℓ  w      \ell(w_{0}w)=\ell(w_{0})-\ell(w).    2  A reduced expression for the longest element is not in general unique.  In a reduced expression for the longest element, every simple reflection must occur at least once. 3  If the Coxeter group is a finite Weyl group then the length of w 0 is the number of the positive roots .  The open cell Bw 0 B in the Bruhat decomposition of a semisimple algebraic group  G is dense in Zariski topology ; topologically, it is the top dimensional cell of the decomposition, and represents the fundamental class .  The longest element is the central element –1 except for    A  n     subscript  A  n    A_{n}   (    n  ≥  2      n  2    n\geq 2   ),    D  n     subscript  D  n    D_{n}   for n odd,     E  6   ,     subscript  E  6    E_{6},   and     I  2    (  p  )        subscript  I  2   p    I_{2}(p)   for p odd, when it is –1 multiplied by the order 2 automorphism of the Coxeter diagram . 4   See also   Coxeter element , a different distinguished element  Coxeter number  Length function   References      "  Category:Coxeter groups     ↩    ↩
