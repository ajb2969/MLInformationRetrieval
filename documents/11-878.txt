Cortisol O-acetyltransferase




Cortisol O-acetyltransferase

In enzymology, a cortisol O-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acetyl-CoA + cortisol 
 
 
 
 
  CoA + cortisol 21-acetate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and cortisol, whereas its two products are CoA and cortisol 21-acetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:cortisol O-acetyltransferase. Other names in common use include cortisol acetyltransferase, corticosteroid acetyltransferase, and corticosteroid-21-O-acetyltransferase.
