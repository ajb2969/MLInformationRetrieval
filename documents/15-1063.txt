Pentalenolactone F synthase

Pentalenolactone F synthase (, PEND (gene), PNTD (gene), PTLD (gene)) is an enzyme with system name pentalenolactone-D,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

pentalenolactone D + 2 2-oxoglutarate + 2 O2

pentalenolactone F + 2 succinate + 2 CO2 + H2O (overall reaction)
 
(1a) pentalenolactone D + 2-oxoglutarate + O2

 
  pentalenolactone E + succinate + CO2 + H2O
 
(1b) pentalenolactone E + 2-oxoglutarate + O2

 
  pentalenolactone F + succinate + CO2


Pentalenolactone F synthase contains Fe(II), and ascorbate is needed for its action.
