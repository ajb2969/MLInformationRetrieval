Fowler–Yang equations

The Fowler–Yang equations1 for pressure solution2 and viscous compaction in sedimentary basins can be written as:






where u is the Darcy velocity and 
 
 
 
  is the porosity of the porous media. In addition, 0 5 is a constant, and while m = 8. This system is highly nonlinear, which can explain the transition from one behaviour to another in pressure solution.
