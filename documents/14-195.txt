   Fowler–Yang equations      Fowler–Yang equations   The Fowler–Yang equations 1 for pressure solution 2 and viscous compaction in sedimentary basins can be written as:         ∂  ϕ    ∂  t    =    ∂   ∂  z     [    (   1  -  ϕ   )   u   ]     ,          ϕ     t           z     delimited-[]      1  ϕ   u       \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial}{\partial z}[(1-\phi)u],          u  =   λ   ϕ  m    [      ∂  2   u    ∂   z  2     -   (   1  -  ϕ   )    ]     ,      u    λ   superscript  ϕ  m    delimited-[]        superscript   2   u      superscript  z  2       1  ϕ        u=\lambda\phi^{m}\left[\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial z^{2}}-(1-\phi)\right],     where u is the Darcy velocity and   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is the porosity of the porous media. In addition, 0 5 is a constant, and while m = 8. This system is highly nonlinear, which can explain the transition from one behaviour to another in pressure solution.
