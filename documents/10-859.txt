Tryptophan 2-C-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a tryptophan 2-C-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + L-tryptophan 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + L-2-methyltryptophan
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and L-tryptophan, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and L-2-methyltryptophan.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:L-tryptophan 2-C-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include tryptophan 2-methyltransferase, and S-adenosylmethionine:tryptophan 2-methyltransferase.
