   F-divergence      F-divergence   In probability theory , an ƒ -divergence is a function D f ( P || Q ) that measures the difference between two probability distributions  P and Q . It helps the intuition to think of the divergence as an average, weighted by the function f , of the odds ratio given by P and Q .  These divergences were introduced and studied independently by ,  and  and are sometimes known as Csiszár ƒ -divergences, Csiszár-Morimoto divergences or Ali-Silvey distances.  Definition  Let P and Q be two probability distributions over a space Ω such that P is absolutely continuous with respect to Q . Then, for a convex function  f such that f (1) = 0, the f -divergence of Q from P is defined as       D  f    (  P  ∥  Q  )   ≡   ∫  Ω   f   (    d  P    d  Q    )   d  Q  .     fragments   subscript  D  f    fragments  normal-(  P  parallel-to  Q  normal-)     subscript   normal-Ω   f   fragments  normal-(      d  P     d  Q    normal-)   d  Q  normal-.    D_{f}(P\parallel Q)\equiv\int_{\Omega}f\left(\frac{dP}{dQ}\right)\,dQ.     If P and Q are both absolutely continuous with respect to a reference distribution μ on Ω then their probability densities  p and q satisfy dP = p dμ and dQ = q dμ . In this case the f -divergence can be written as       D  f    (  P  ∥  Q  )   =   ∫  Ω   f   (    p   (  x  )     q   (  x  )     )   q   (  x  )   d  μ   (  x  )   .     fragments   subscript  D  f    fragments  normal-(  P  parallel-to  Q  normal-)     subscript   normal-Ω   f   fragments  normal-(      p  x     q  x    normal-)   q   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   d  μ   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-.    D_{f}(P\parallel Q)=\int_{\Omega}f\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right)q(x)\,d\mu(x).     The f-divergences can be expressed using Taylor series and rewritten using a weighted sum of chi-type distances ().  Instances of f -divergences  Many common divergences, such as KL-divergence , Hellinger distance , and total variation distance , are special cases of f -divergence, coinciding with a particular choice of f .
