   Shannon multigraph      Shannon multigraph   __NOTOC__ In the mathematical discipline of graph theory , Shannon multigraphs , named after Claude Shannon by , are a special type of triangle graphs , which are used in the field of edge coloring in particular.   A Shannon multigraph is multigraph with 3 vertices for which either of the following conditions holds:   a) all 3 vertices are connected by the same number of edges.  b) as in a) and one additional edge is added.     More precisely one speaks of Shannon multigraph    S  h   (  n  )       S  h  n    Sh(n)   , if the three vertices are connected by    ⌊   n  2   ⌋        n  2     \left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor   ,    ⌊   n  2   ⌋        n  2     \left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor   and    ⌊    n  +  1   2   ⌋          n  1   2     \left\lfloor\frac{n+1}{2}\right\rfloor   edges respectively. This multigraph has maximum degree    n   n   n   . Its multiplicity (the maximum number of edges in a set of edges that all have the same endpoints) is    ⌊    n  +  1   2   ⌋          n  1   2     \left\lfloor\frac{n+1}{2}\right\rfloor   .

When   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   is even, the example of the Shannon multigraph with multiplicity    Δ  /  2      normal-Δ  2    \Delta/2   shows that this bound is tight: the vertex degree is exactly   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   , but each of the     3  2   Δ        3  2   normal-Δ    \frac{3}{2}\Delta   edges is adjacent to every other edge, so it requires     3  2   Δ        3  2   normal-Δ    \frac{3}{2}\Delta   colors in any proper edge coloring.  A version of Vizing's theorem states that every multigraph with maximum degree   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   and multiplicity   μ   μ   \mu   may be colored using at most    Δ  +  μ      normal-Δ  μ    \Delta+\mu   colors. Again, this bound is tight for the Shannon multigraphs.  References     .   .   .   .   External links   Lutz Volkmann: Graphen an allen Ecken und Kanten .
