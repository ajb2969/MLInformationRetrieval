Shannon multigraph

__NOTOC__ In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, Shannon multigraphs, named after Claude Shannon by , are a special type of triangle graphs, which are used in the field of edge coloring in particular.

A Shannon multigraph is multigraph with 3 vertices for which either of the following conditions holds:

a) all 3 vertices are connected by the same number of edges.
b) as in a) and one additional edge is added.



More precisely one speaks of Shannon multigraph 
 
 
 
 , if the three vertices are connected by 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  edges respectively. This multigraph has maximum degree

 
 . Its multiplicity (the maximum number of edges in a set of edges that all have the same endpoints) is 
 
 
 
 .

Edge coloring
 According to a theorem of , every multigraph with maximum degree 
 
 
 
  has an edge coloring that uses at most 
 
 
 
  colors. When 
 
 
 
 
  is even, the example of the Shannon multigraph with multiplicity 
 
 
 
  shows that this bound is tight: the vertex degree is exactly 
 
 
 
 , but each of the 
 
 
 
  edges is adjacent to every other edge, so it requires 
 
 
 
  colors in any proper edge coloring.
A version of Vizing's theorem  states that every multigraph with maximum degree 
 
 
 
 
  and multiplicity 
 
 
 
  may be colored using at most 
 
 
 
  colors. Again, this bound is tight for the Shannon multigraphs.
