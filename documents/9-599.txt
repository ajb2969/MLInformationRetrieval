Well-pointed category

In category theory, a category with a terminal object

 
  is well-pointed if for every pair of arrows 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , there is an arrow 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . (The arrows 
 
 
 
  are called the global elements or points of the category; a well-pointed category is thus one that has "enough points" to distinguish non-equal arrows.)
