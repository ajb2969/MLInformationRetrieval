   Enveloping von Neumann algebra      Enveloping von Neumann algebra   In operator algebras , the enveloping von Neumann algebra of a C*-algebra is a von Neumann algebra that contains all the operator-algebraic information about the given C*-algebra. This may also be called the universal enveloping von Neumann algebra , since it is given by a universal property ; and (as always with von Neumann algebras) the term W*-algebra may be used in place of von Neumann algebra .  Definition  Let A be a C*-algebra and π U be its universal representation , acting on Hilbert space H U . The image of π U , π U ( A ), is a C*-subalgebra of bounded operators on H U . The enveloping von Neumann algebra of A is the closure of π U ( A ) in the weak operator topology. It is sometimes denoted by A ′′.  Properties  The universal representation π U and A ′′ satisfies the following universal property : for any representation π , there is a unique *-homomorphism      Φ  :     π  U     (  A  )   ′′    →   π    (  A  )   ′′        normal-:  normal-Φ   normal-→     subscript  π  U    superscript  A  ′′      π   superscript  A  ′′       \Phi:\pi_{U}(A)^{\prime\prime}\rightarrow\pi(A)^{\prime\prime}     that is continuous in the weak operator topology and the restriction of Φ to π U ( A ) is π .  As a particular case, one can consider the continuous functional calculus , whose unique extension gives a canonical Borel functional calculus .  By the Sherman–Takeda theorem , the double dual of a C*-algebra A , A **, can be identified with A ′′, as Banach spaces .  Every representation of A uniquely determines a central projection (i.e. a projection in the center of the algebra) in A ′′; it is called the central cover of that projection.
