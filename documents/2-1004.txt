10 (number)

10 (ten ) is an even natural number following 9 and preceding 11. Ten is the base of the decimal numeral system, by far the most common system of denoting numbers in both spoken and written language. The reason for the choice of ten is assumed to be that humans have ten fingers (digits).
Common usage and derived terms

A collection of ten items (most often ten years) is called a decade.
The ordinal adjective is decimal; the distributive adjective is denary.
Increasing a quantity by one order of magnitude is most widely understood to mean multiplying the quantity by ten.
To reduce something by one tenth is to decimate. (In ancient Rome, the killing of one in ten soldiers in a cohort was the punishment for cowardice or mutiny; or, one-tenth of the able-bodied men in a village as a form of retribution, thus causing a labor shortage and threat of starvation in agrarian societies.)

In mathematics
Ten is a composite number, its proper divisors being ,  and . Ten is the smallest noncototient, a number that cannot be expressed as the difference between any integer and the total number of coprimes below it.
Ten is the second discrete semiprime (2.5) and the second member of the (2.q) discrete semiprime family. Ten has an aliquot sum σ(n) of 8 and is accordingly the first discrete semiprime to be in deficit. All subsequent discrete semiprimes are in deficit. The aliquot sequence for 10 comprises five members (10,8,7,1,0) with this number being the second composite member of the 7-aliquot tree.
Ten is the smallest semiprime that is the sum of all the distinct prime numbers from its lower factor through its higher factor (10 = 2 + 3 + 5 = 2 . 5) Only three other small semiprimes (39, 155, and 371) share this attribute.
It is the aliquot sum of only one number the discrete semiprime 14.
Ten is a semi-meandric number.
Ten is the sum of the first three prime numbers, of the four first numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + 4), of the square of the two first odd numbers and also of the first four factorials (0! + 1! + 2! + 3!). Ten is the eighth Perrin number, preceded in the sequence by 5, 5, 7.
A polygon with ten sides is a decagon, and 10 is a decagonal number. Because 10 is the product of a power of 2 (namely 21) with nothing but distinct Fermat primes (specifically 5), a regular decagon is a constructible polygon.
Ten is also a triangular number, a centered triangular number, and a tetrahedral number.
Ten is the number of n-Queens Problem solutions for n = 5.
Ten is the smallest number whose status as a possible friendly number is unknown.
In numeral systems
Decimal system
As is the case for any base in its system, ten is the first two-digit number in decimal and thus the lowest number where the position of a numeral affects its value. Any integer written in the decimal system can be multiplied by ten by adding a zero to the end (e.g. 855 * 10 = 8550).
Roman numerals
The Roman numeral for ten is X (which looks like two V's [the Roman numeral for 5] put together); it is thought that the V for five is derived from an open hand (five digits displayed), and X for ten from both hands. Incidentally, the Chinese word numeral for ten, is also a cross: 十.
Positional numeral systems other than decimal
The digit '1' followed by '0' is how the value of p is written in base p. (E.g. 16 in hexadecimal is 10.)
