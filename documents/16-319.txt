   Turán's method      Turán's method   In mathematics, Turán's method provides lower bounds for exponential sums and complex power sums . The method has been applied to problems in equidistribution .  The method applies to sums of the form       s  ν   =    ∑   n  =  1   N     b  n    z  n  ν          subscript  s  ν     superscript   subscript     n  1    N      subscript  b  n    superscript   subscript  z  n   ν       s_{\nu}=\sum_{n=1}^{N}b_{n}z_{n}^{\nu}     where the b and z are complex numbers and ν runs over a range of integers. There are two main results, depending on the size of the complex numbers z .  Turán's first theorem  The first result applies to sums s ν where     |   z  n   |   ≥  1         subscript  z  n    1    |z_{n}|\geq 1   for all n . For any range of ν of length N , say ν = M + 1, ..., M + N , there is some ν with | s ν | at least c ( M , N )| s 0 | where        c   (  M  ,  N  )    =     (    ∑   k  =  0    N  -  1      (      M  +  k       k     )    2  k     )    -  1      .        c   M  N     superscript    superscript   subscript     k  0      N  1       binomial    M  k   k    superscript  2  k       1      c(M,N)=\left({\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}{\left({{M+k}\atop{k}}\right)}2^{k}}\right)^{-1}\ .     The sum here may be replaced by the weaker but simpler     (   N   2  e   (   M  +  N   )     )    N  -  1      superscript    N    2  e    M  N       N  1     \left({\frac{N}{2e(M+N)}}\right)^{N-1}   .  We may deduce the Fabry gap theorem from this result.  Turán's second theorem  The second result applies to sums s ν where     |   z  n   |   ≤  1         subscript  z  n    1    |z_{n}|\leq 1   for all n . Assume that the z are ordered in decreasing absolute value and scaled so that | z 1 | = 1. Then there is some ν with        |   s  ν   |   ≥   2    (   N   8  e   (   M  +  N   )     )   N     min   1  ≤  j  ≤  N     |    ∑   n  =  1   j    b  n    |      .         subscript  s  ν      2   superscript    N    8  e    M  N     N     subscript       1  j       N         superscript   subscript     n  1    j    subscript  b  n         |s_{\nu}|\geq 2\left({\frac{N}{8e(M+N)}}\right)^{N}\min_{1\leq j\leq N}\left|{%
