   Deacetoxycephalosporin-C synthase      Deacetoxycephalosporin-C synthase   In enzymology , a deacetoxycephalosporin-C synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction  (Figure)  Deacetoxycephalosporin-C synthase.svg    penicillin N + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   deacetoxycephalosporin C + succinate + CO 2 + H 2 O   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are penicillin N , 2-oxoglutarate , and O 2 , whereas its 4 products are deacetoxycephalosporin C , succinate , CO 2 , and H 2 O .  Classification  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and the other dehydrogenated.  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is penicillin-N,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (ring-expanding) . Other names in common use include DAOCS , penicillin N expandase , and DAOC synthase .  Biological role  This enzyme participates in penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
