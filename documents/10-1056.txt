penicillin N + 2-oxoglutarate + O2

 
  deacetoxycephalosporin C + succinate + CO2 + H2O

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are penicillin N, 2-oxoglutarate, and O2, whereas its 4 products are deacetoxycephalosporin C, succinate, CO2, and H2O.
Classification
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and the other dehydrogenated.
Nomenclature
The systematic name of this enzyme class is penicillin-N,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (ring-expanding). Other names in common use include DAOCS, penicillin N expandase, and DAOC synthase.
Biological role
This enzyme participates in penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
