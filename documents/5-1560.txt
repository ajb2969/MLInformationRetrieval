Parametric derivative

Parametric derivative is a derivative in calculus that is taken when both the x and y variables (traditionally independent and dependent, respectively) depend on an independent third variable t, usually thought of as "time".
Example
For example, consider the set of functions where:


 
  and



The first derivative of the parametric equations above is given by:



where the notation 
 
 
 
  denotes the derivative of x with respect to t, for example. To understand why the derivative appears in this way, recall the chain rule for derivatives:



or in other words



More formally, by the chain rule:



and dividing both sides by 
 
 
 
  gets the equation above.
Differentiating both functions with respect to t leads to



and



respectively. Substituting these into the formula for the parametric derivative, we obtain



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are understood to be functions of t.
The second derivative of a parametric equation is given by







































by making use of the quotient rule for derivatives. The latter result is useful in the computation of curvature.
