Biregular graph

In graph-theoretic mathematics, a biregular graph1 or semiregular bipartite graph2 is a bipartite graph

 
  for which every two vertices on the same side of the given bipartition have the same degree as each other. If the degree of the vertices in 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  and the degree of the vertices in 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , then the graph is said to be 
 
 
 
 -biregular.
(Figure)
The graph of the rhombic dodecahedron is biregular.

Example
Every complete bipartite graph

 
  is 
 
 
 
 -biregular.3 The rhombic dodecahedron is another example; it is (3,4)-biregular.4
Vertex counts
An 
 
 
 
 -biregular graph 
 
 
 
  must satisfy the equation 
 
 
 
 . This follows from a simple double counting argument: the number of endpoints of edges in 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , the number of endpoints of edges in 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , and each edge contributes the same amount (one) to both numbers.
Symmetry
Every regular bipartite graph is also biregular. Every edge-transitive graph (disallowing graphs with isolated vertices) that is not also vertex-transitive must be biregular.5 In particular every edge-transitive graph is either regular or biregular.
Configurations
The Levi graphs of geometric configurations are biregular; a biregular graph is the Levi graph of an (abstract) configuration if and only if its girth is at least six.6
