   Biregular graph      Biregular graph   In graph-theoretic mathematics , a biregular graph 1 or semiregular bipartite graph 2 is a bipartite graph     G  =   (  U  ,  V  ,  E  )       G   U  V  E     G=(U,V,E)   for which every two vertices on the same side of the given bipartition have the same degree as each other. If the degree of the vertices in   U   U   U   is   x   x   x   and the degree of the vertices in   V   V   V   is   y   y   y   , then the graph is said to be    (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,y)   -biregular.  (Figure)  The graph of the rhombic dodecahedron is biregular.   Example  Every complete bipartite graph     K   a  ,  b      subscript  K   a  b     K_{a,b}   is    (  b  ,  a  )     b  a    (b,a)   -biregular. 3 The rhombic dodecahedron is another example; it is (3,4)-biregular. 4  Vertex counts  An    (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,y)   -biregular graph    G  =   (  U  ,  V  ,  E  )       G   U  V  E     G=(U,V,E)   must satisfy the equation     x   |  U  |    =   y   |  V  |          x    U      y    V      x|U|=y|V|   . This follows from a simple double counting argument : the number of endpoints of edges in   U   U   U   is    x   |  U  |       x    U     x|U|   , the number of endpoints of edges in   V   V   V   is    y   |  V  |       y    V     y|V|   , and each edge contributes the same amount (one) to both numbers.  Symmetry  Every regular bipartite graph is also biregular. Every edge-transitive graph (disallowing graphs with isolated vertices ) that is not also vertex-transitive must be biregular. 5 In particular every edge-transitive graph is either regular or biregular.  Configurations  The Levi graphs of geometric configurations are biregular; a biregular graph is the Levi graph of an (abstract) configuration if and only if its girth is at least six. 6  References  "  Category:Graph theory     . ↩  . ↩   . ↩  . ↩  . ↩
