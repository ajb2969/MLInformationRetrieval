   4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase      4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase   In enzymology , a 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate + H 2 O + protein-disulfide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate + protein-dithiol   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate (HMB-PP), water , and protein disulfide , whereas its two products are 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate and protein dithiol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on CH or CH 2 groups with a disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl-diphosphate:protein-disulfide oxidoreductase (hydrating) . This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of steroids .
