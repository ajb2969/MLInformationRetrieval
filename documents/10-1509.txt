L-pipecolate oxidase




L-pipecolate oxidase

In enzymology, a L-pipecolate oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-pipecolate + O2

 
  2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2-carboxylate + H2O2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-pipecolate and O2, whereas its two products are 2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2-carboxylate and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-pipecolate:oxygen 1,6-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include pipecolate oxidase, and L-pipecolic acid oxidase. This enzyme participates in lysine degradation.
