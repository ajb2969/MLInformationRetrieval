   Globoside alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase      Globoside alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase   In enzymology , a globoside alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine + N-acetyl-D-galactosaminyl-1,3-D-galactosyl-1,4-D-galactosyl-1,4-D- glucosylceramide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + N-acetyl-D-galactosaminyl-N-acetyl-D-galactosaminyl-1,3-D- galactosyl-1,4-D-galactosyl-1,4-D-glucosylceramide   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine , N-acetyl-D-galactosaminyl-1,3-D-galactosyl-1,4-D-galactosyl-1,4-D- , and glucosylceramide , whereas its 3 products are UDP , N-acetyl-D-galactosaminyl-N-acetyl-D-galactosaminyl-1,3-D- , and galactosyl-1,4-D-galactosyl-1,4-D-glucosylceramide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine:N-acetyl-D-galactosaminyl-1,3-D-galacto syl-1,4-D-galactosyl-1,4-D-glucosylceramide alpha-N-acetyl-D-galactosaminyltransferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoacetylgalactosamine-globoside , alpha-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase , Forssman synthase , and globoside acetylgalactosaminyltransferase . This enzyme participates in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - globoseries and glycan structures - biosynthesis 2 .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
