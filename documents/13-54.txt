   Dudley's theorem      Dudley's theorem   In probability theory , Dudley’s theorem is a result relating the expected  upper bound and regularity properties of a Gaussian process to its entropy and covariance structure.  History  The result was proved in a landmark 1967 paper of Richard M. Dudley ; Dudley himself credited Volker Strassen for making the connection between entropy and regularity.  Statement of the theorem  Let ( X t ) t ∈ T be a Gaussian process and let d X be the pseudometric on T defined by         d  X    (  s  ,  t  )    =    𝐄   [    |    X  s   -   X  t    |   2   ]      .         subscript  d  X    s  t        𝐄   delimited-[]   superscript       subscript  X  s    subscript  X  t     2        d_{X}(s,t)=\sqrt{\mathbf{E}\big[|X_{s}-X_{t}|^{2}]}.\,     For ε > 0, denote by N ( T , d X ; ε ) the entropy number , i.e. the minimal number of (open) d X -balls of radius ε required to cover T . Then        𝐄   [    sup   t  ∈  T     X  t    ]    ≤   24    ∫  0   +  ∞         log  N    (  T  ,   d  X   ;  ε  )      d  ε      .        𝐄   delimited-[]    subscript  supremum    t  T     subscript  X  t        24    superscript   subscript   0                N    T   subscript  d  X   ε     normal-d  ε       \mathbf{E}\left[\sup_{t\in T}X_{t}\right]\leq 24\int_{0}^{+\infty}\sqrt{\log N%
 (T,d_{X};\varepsilon)}\,\mathrm{d}\varepsilon.     Furthermore, if the entropy integral on the right-hand side converges, then X has a version with almost all sample path bounded and (uniformly) continuous on ( T , d X ).  Non-uniqueness  The solution is highly non-unique. There are infinitely many representation of the 0 function, and any of these can be added to a representation to obtain another representation. 1  References    {{ cite book   | last1 = Ledoux | first1 = Michel | last2 = Talagrand | first2 = Michel | author2-link = Michel Talagrand | title = Probability in Banach spaces | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin | year = 1991 | pages = xii+480 | isbn = 3-540-52013-9 | mr = 1102015 }} (See chapter 11)  "  Category:Entropy  Category:Probability theorems  Category:Stochastic processes     Steele, J.
