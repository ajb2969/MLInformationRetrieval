   Grimm's conjecture      Grimm's conjecture   In mathematics , and in particular number theory , Grimm's conjecture (named after Carl Albert Grimm) states that to each element of a set of consecutive composite numbers one can assign a distinct prime that divides it. It was first published in American Mathematical Monthly , 76(1969) 1126-1128.  Formal statement  Suppose n + 1, n + 2, …, n + k are all composite numbers , then there are k distinct primes p i such that p i  divides  n + i for 1 ≤ i ≤ k .  Weaker version  A weaker, though still unproven, version of this conjecture goes: If there is no prime in the interval    [   n  +  1   ,   n  +  k   ]       n  1     n  k     [n+1,n+k]   , then     ∏   x  ≤  k     (   n  +  x   )       subscript  product    x  k      n  x     \prod_{x\leq k}(n+x)   has at least k distinct prime divisors .
