   Mannosylfructose-phosphate synthase      Mannosylfructose-phosphate synthase   Mannosylfructose-phosphate synthase (, mannosylfructose-6-phosphate synthase , MFPS ) is an enzyme with system name GDP-mannose:D-fructose-6-phosphate 2-alpha-D-mannosyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   GDP-mannose + D-fructose 6-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GDP + beta-D-fructofuranosyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside 6F-phosphate   This enzyme, from the soil proteobacterium and plant pathogen  Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 , requires Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ for activity.
