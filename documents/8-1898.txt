   Heavy-tailed distribution      Heavy-tailed distribution   In probability theory , heavy-tailed distributions are probability distributions whose tails are not exponentially bounded: 1 that is, they have heavier tails than the exponential distribution . In many applications it is the right tail of the distribution that is of interest, but a distribution may have a heavy left tail, or both tails may be heavy.  There are three important subclasses of heavy-tailed distributions: the fat-tailed distributions , the long-tailed distributions and the subexponential distributions . In practice, all commonly used heavy-tailed distributions belong to the subexponential class.  There is still some discrepancy over the use of the term heavy-tailed . There are two other definitions in use. Some authors use the term to refer to those distributions which do not have all their power moments finite; and some others to those distributions that do not have a finite variance . The definition given in this article is the most general in use, and includes all distributions encompassed by the alternative definitions, as well as those distributions such as log-normal that possess all their power moments, yet which are generally acknowledged to be heavy-tailed. (Occasionally, heavy-tailed is used for any distribution that has heavier tails than the normal distribution.)  Definitions  Definition of heavy-tailed distribution  The distribution of a random variable  X with distribution function  F is said to have a heavy right tail if 2         lim   x  →  ∞      e   λ  x     Pr   [   X  >  x   ]      =  ∞     for all  λ   >   0.       formulae-sequence      subscript    normal-→  x        superscript  e    λ  x     Pr    X  x            for all  λ   0.     \lim_{x\to\infty}e^{\lambda x}\Pr[X>x]=\infty\quad\mbox{for all }\lambda>0.\,     This is also written in terms of the tail distribution function        F  ¯    (  x  )    ≡   Pr   [   X  >  x   ]           normal-¯  F   x    Pr    X  x      \overline{F}(x)\equiv\Pr[X>x]\,     as         lim   x  →  ∞      e   λ  x     F  ¯    (  x  )     =  ∞     for all  λ   >   0.       formulae-sequence      subscript    normal-→  x        superscript  e    λ  x     normal-¯  F   x          for all  λ   0.     \lim_{x\to\infty}e^{\lambda x}\overline{F}(x)=\infty\quad\mbox{for all }%
 \lambda>0.\,     This is equivalent to the statement that the moment generating function of F , M F ( t ), is infinite for all t > 0. 3  The definitions of heavy-tailed for left-tailed or two tailed distributions are similar.  Definition of long-tailed distribution  The distribution of a random variable  X with distribution function  F is said to have a long right tail 4 if for all t > 0,         lim   x  →  ∞     Pr   [   X  >   x  +   t   |  X  >   x     ]     =  1   ,        subscript    normal-→  x      Pr    X    x    t   ket  X   x       1    \lim_{x\to\infty}\Pr[X>x+t|X>x]=1,\,     or equivalently          F  ¯    (   x  +  t   )    ∼    F  ¯    (  x  )       as  x   →  ∞    .     formulae-sequence   similar-to     normal-¯  F     x  t       normal-¯  F   x     normal-→    as  x       \overline{F}(x+t)\sim\overline{F}(x)\quad\mbox{as }x\to\infty.\,     This has the intuitive interpretation for a right-tailed long-tailed distributed quantity that if the long-tailed quantity exceeds some high level, the probability approaches 1 that it will exceed any other higher level: if you know the situation is good, it is probably better than you think.  All long-tailed distributions are heavy-tailed, but the converse is false, and it is possible to construct heavy-tailed distributions that are not long-tailed.  Subexponential distributions  Subexponentiality is defined in terms of convolutions of probability distributions . For two independent, identically distributed random variables      X  1   ,   X  2       subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2     X_{1},X_{2}   with common distribution function   F   F   F   the convolution of   F   F   F   with itself,    F    *  2      superscript  F    absent  2     F^{*2}   is defined, using Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration , by:        Pr   [     X  1   +   X  2    ≤  x   ]    =    F    *  2     (  x  )    =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞    F   (   x  -  y   )   d  F   (  y  )      .         Pr       subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2    x       superscript  F    absent  2    x          superscript   subscript            F    x  y   d  F  y       \Pr[X_{1}+X_{2}\leq x]=F^{*2}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}F(x-y)\,dF(y).     The n -fold convolution    F    *  n      superscript  F    absent  n     F^{*n}   is defined in the same way. The tail distribution function    F  ¯     normal-¯  F    \overline{F}   is defined as      F  ¯    (  x  )    =   1  -   F   (  x  )            normal-¯  F   x     1    F  x      \overline{F}(x)=1-F(x)   .  A distribution   F   F   F   on the positive half-line is subexponential 5 6 7 if           F    *  2    ¯    (  x  )    ∼   2   F  ¯    (  x  )       as  x   →  ∞    .     formulae-sequence   similar-to     normal-¯   superscript  F    absent  2     x     2   normal-¯  F   x     normal-→    as  x       \overline{F^{*2}}(x)\sim 2\overline{F}(x)\quad\mbox{as }x\to\infty.     This implies 8 that, for any    n  ≥  1      n  1    n\geq 1   ,           F    *  n    ¯    (  x  )    ∼   n   F  ¯    (  x  )       as  x   →  ∞    .     formulae-sequence   similar-to     normal-¯   superscript  F    absent  n     x     n   normal-¯  F   x     normal-→    as  x       \overline{F^{*n}}(x)\sim n\overline{F}(x)\quad\mbox{as }x\to\infty.     The probabilistic interpretation 9 of this is that, for a sum of   n   n   n    independent  random variables      X  1   ,  …  ,   X  n       subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  n     X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}   with common distribution   F   F   F   ,         Pr   [     X  1   +  ⋯  +   X  n    >  x   ]    ∼   Pr   [    max   (   X  1   ,  …  ,   X  n   )    >  x   ]       as  x   →  ∞    .     formulae-sequence   similar-to   Pr       subscript  X  1   normal-⋯   subscript  X  n    x     Pr       subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  n    x      normal-→    as  x       \Pr[X_{1}+\cdots+X_{n}>x]\sim\Pr[\max(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})>x]\quad\text{as }x%
 \to\infty.     This is often known as the principle of the single big jump 10 or catastrophe principle. 11  A distribution   F   F   F   on the whole real line is subexponential if the distribution    F  I   (   [  0  ,  ∞  )   )       F  I   0      FI([0,\infty))   is. 12 Here    I   (   [  0  ,  ∞  )   )       I   0      I([0,\infty))   is the indicator function of the positive half-line. Alternatively, a random variable   X   X   X   supported on the real line is subexponential if and only if     X  +   =   max   (  0  ,  X  )         superscript  X      0  X     X^{+}=\max(0,X)   is subexponential.  All subexponential distributions are long-tailed, but examples can be constructed of long-tailed distributions that are not subexponential.  Common heavy-tailed distributions  All commonly used heavy-tailed distributions are subexponential. 13  Those that are one-tailed include:   the Pareto distribution ;  the Log-normal distribution ;  the Lévy distribution ;  the Weibull distribution with shape parameter less than 1;  the Burr distribution ;  the log-gamma distribution ;  the log-Cauchy distribution , sometimes described as having a "super-heavy tail" because it exhibits logarithmic decay producing a heavier tail than the Pareto distribution. 14 15   Those that are two-tailed include:   The Cauchy distribution , itself a special case of both the stable distribution and the t-distribution;  The family of stable distributions , 16 excepting the special case of the normal distribution within that family. Some stable distributions are one-sided (or supported by a half-line), see e.g. Lévy distribution . See also financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering .  The t-distribution .  The skew lognormal cascade distribution. 17   Relationship to fat-tailed distributions  A fat-tailed distribution is a distribution for which the probability density function, for large x, goes to zero as a power    x   -  a      superscript  x    a     x^{-a}   . Since such a power is always bounded below by the probability density function of an exponential distribution, fat-tailed distributions are always heavy-tailed. Some distributions however have a tail which goes to zero slower than an exponential function (meaning they are heavy-tailed), but faster than a power (meaning they are not fat-tailed). An example is the log-normal distribution . Many other heavy-tailed distributions such as the log-logistic and Pareto distribution are however also fat-tailed.  Estimating the tail-index  There are parametric (see Embrechts et al. 18 ) and non-parametric (see, e.g., Novak 19 ) approaches to the problem of the tail-index estimation.  To estimate the tail-index using the parametric approach, some authors employ GEV distribution or Pareto distribution ; they may apply the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE).

This estimator converge in probability to   ξ   ξ   \xi   . Under certain assumptions it is asymptotically normally distributed. 24  Ratio estimator of the tail-index  The ratio estimator (RE-estimator) of the tail-index was introduced by Goldie and Smith.

It is constructed similarly to Hill's estimator but uses a non-random "tuning parameter".
