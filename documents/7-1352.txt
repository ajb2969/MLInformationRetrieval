Bandwidth expansion

Bandwidth expansion is a technique for widening the bandwidth or the resonances in an LPC filter. This is done by moving all the poles towards the origin by a constant factor 
 
 
 
 . The bandwidth-expanded filter 
 
 
 
  can be easily derived from the original filter

 
  by:



Let 
 
 
 
  be expressed as:



The bandwidth-expanded filter can be expressed as:



In other words, each coefficient

 
  in the original filter is simply multiplied by 
 
 
 
 
  in the bandwidth-expanded filter. The simplicity of this transformation makes it attractive, especially in CELP coding of speech, where it is often used for the perceptual noise weighting and/or to stabilize the LPC analysis. However, when it comes to stabilizing the LPC analysis, lag windowing is often preferred to bandwidth expansion.
