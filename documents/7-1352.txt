   Bandwidth expansion      Bandwidth expansion   Bandwidth expansion is a technique for widening the bandwidth or the resonances in an LPC filter. This is done by moving all the poles towards the origin by a constant factor   γ   γ   \gamma   . The bandwidth-expanded filter     A  ′    (  z  )        superscript  A  normal-′   z    A^{\prime}(z)   can be easily derived from the original filter     A   (  z  )       A  z    A(z)   by:        A  ′    (  z  )    =   A   (   z  /  γ   )           superscript  A  normal-′   z     A    z  γ      A^{\prime}(z)=A(z/\gamma)     Let    A   (  z  )       A  z    A(z)   be expressed as:       A   (  z  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   N     a  k    z   -  k            A  z     superscript   subscript     k  0    N      subscript  a  k    superscript  z    k        A(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{N}a_{k}z^{-k}     The bandwidth-expanded filter can be expressed as:        A  ′    (  z  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   N     a  k    γ  k    z   -  k             superscript  A  normal-′   z     superscript   subscript     k  0    N      subscript  a  k    superscript  γ  k    superscript  z    k        A^{\prime}(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{N}a_{k}\gamma^{k}z^{-k}     In other words, each coefficient     a  k     subscript  a  k    a_{k}   in the original filter is simply multiplied by    γ  k     superscript  γ  k    \gamma^{k}   in the bandwidth-expanded filter. The simplicity of this transformation makes it attractive, especially in CELP coding of speech, where it is often used for the perceptual noise weighting and/or to stabilize the LPC analysis. However, when it comes to stabilizing the LPC analysis, lag windowing is often preferred to bandwidth expansion.  References  P.
