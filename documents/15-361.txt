   Hasse invariant of an algebra      Hasse invariant of an algebra   In mathematics , the Hasse invariant of an algebra is an invariant attached to a Brauer class of algebras over a field . The concept is named after Helmut Hasse . The invariant plays a role in local class field theory .  Local fields  Let K be a local field with valuation v and D a K -algebra. We may assume D is a division algebra with centre K of degree n . The valuation v can be extended to D , for example by extending it compatibly to each commutative subfield of D : the value group of this valuation is (1/ n ) Z . 1  There is a commutative subfield L of D which is unramified over K , and D splits over L . 2 The field L is not unique but all such extensions are conjugate by the Skolem–Noether theorem , which further shows that any automorphism of L is induced by a conjugation in D . Take γ in D such that conjugation by γ induces the Frobenius automorphism of L / K and let v (γ) = k / n . Then k / n modulo 1 is the Hasse invariant of D . It depends only on the Brauer class of D . 3  The Hasse invariant is thus a map defined on the Brauer group of a local field  K to the divisible group  Q / Z . 4 5 Every class in the Brauer group is represented by a class in the Brauer group of an unramified extension of L / K of degree n , 6 which by the Grunwald–Wang theorem and the Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem we may take to be a cyclic algebra ( L ,φ,π k ) for some k mod n , where φ is the Frobenius map and π is a uniformiser. 7 The invariant map attaches the element k / n mod 1 to the class. This exhibits the invariant map as a homomorphism        inv   L  /  K    :    Br   (   L  /  K   )    →   ℚ  /  ℤ     .     normal-:     L  K   inv    normal-→   Br    L  K      ℚ  ℤ      \underset{L/K}{\operatorname{inv}}:\operatorname{Br}(L/K)\rightarrow\mathbb{Q}%
 /\mathbb{Z}.     The invariant map extends to Br( K ) by representing each class by some element of Br( L / K ) as above. 8 9  For a non-Archimedean local field, the invariant map is a group isomorphism . 10 11  In the case of the field R of real numbers , there are two Brauer classes, represented by the algebra R itself and the quaternion algebra H . 12 It is convenient to assign invariant zero to the class of R and invariant 1/2 modulo 1 to the quaternion class.  In the case of the field C of complex numbers, the only Brauer class is the trivial one, with invariant zero. 13  Global fields  For a global field K , given a central simple algebra D over K then for each valuation v of K we can consider the extension of scalars D v = D ⊗ K v The extension D v splits for all but finitely many v , so that the local invariant of D v is almost always zero. The Brauer group Br( K ) fits into an exact sequence 14 15       0  →   Br   (  K  )    →    ⊕   v  ∈  S     Br   (   K  v   )     →   𝐐  /  𝐙   →  0   ,       normal-→  0    Br  K     normal-→      subscript  direct-sum    v  S      Br   subscript  K  v       normal-→      𝐐  𝐙     normal-→    0     0\rightarrow\textrm{Br}(K)\rightarrow\bigoplus_{v\in S}\textrm{Br}(K_{v})%
 \rightarrow\mathbf{Q}/\mathbf{Z}\rightarrow 0,     where S is the set of all valuations of K and the right arrow is the sum of the local invariants. The injectivity of the left arrow is the content of the Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem . Exactness in the middle term is a deep fact from global class field theory .
