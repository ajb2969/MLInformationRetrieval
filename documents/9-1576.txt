   Complex geodesic      Complex geodesic   In mathematics , a complex geodesic is a generalization of the notion of geodesic to complex spaces.  Definition  Let ( X , || ||) be a complex Banach space and let B be the open  unit ball in X . Let Δ denote the open unit disc in the complex plane  C , thought of as the Poincaré disc model for 2-dimensional real/1-dimensional complex hyperbolic geometry . Let the Poincaré metric ρ on Δ be given by       ρ   (  a  ,  b  )    =    tanh   -  1      |   a  -  b   |    |   1  -    a  ¯   b    |           ρ   a  b      superscript     1          a  b        1     normal-¯  a   b         \rho(a,b)=\tanh^{-1}\frac{|a-b|}{|1-\bar{a}b|}     and denote the corresponding Carathéodory metric on B by d . Then a holomorphic function  f : Δ → B is said to be a complex geodesic if       d   (   f   (  w  )    ,   f   (  z  )    )    =   ρ   (  w  ,  z  )          d     f  w     f  z       ρ   w  z      d(f(w),f(z))=\rho(w,z)\,     for all points w and z in Δ.  Properties and examples of complex geodesics   Given u ∈ X with || u || = 1, the map f : Δ → B given by f ( z ) = zu is a complex geodesic.  Geodesics can be reparametrized: if f is a complex geodesic and g ∈ Aut(Δ) is a bi-holomorphic automorphism of the disc Δ, then f  o  g is also a complex geodesic. In fact, any complex geodesic f 1 with the same image as f (i.e., f 1 (Δ) = f (Δ)) arises as such a reparametrization of f .  If          d   (   f   (  0  )    ,   f   (  z  )    )    =   ρ   (  0  ,  z  )          d     f  0     f  z       ρ   0  z      d(f(0),f(z))=\rho(0,z)       for some z ≠ 0, then f is a complex geodesic.    If           α   (   f   (  0  )    ,    f  ′    (  0  )    )    =  1   ,        α     f  0      superscript  f  normal-′   0     1    \alpha(f(0),f^{\prime}(0))=1,       where α denotes the Caratheodory length of a tangent vector, then f is a complex geodesic.
