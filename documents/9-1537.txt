(Figure)  The sheets of the Cayley graph of the Baumslag-Solitar group    B  S   (  1  ,  2  )       B  S   1  2     BS(1,2)   fit together into an infinite binary tree .   In the mathematical field of group theory , the Baumslag–Solitar groups are examples of two-generator one-relator groups that play an important role in combinatorial group theory and geometric group theory as (counter)examples and test-cases. They are given by the group presentation       ⟨    a  ,   b    :    b   a  m    b   -  1     =   a  n     ⟩   .     delimited-⟨⟩   normal-:   a  b       b   superscript  a  m    superscript  b    1      superscript  a  n       \left\langle a,b\ :\ ba^{m}b^{-1}=a^{n}\right\rangle.     For each integer   m   m   m   and   n   n   n   , the Baumslag–Solitar group is denoted    B  S   (  m  ,  n  )       B  S   m  n     BS(m,n)   . The relation in the presentation is called the Baumslag–Solitar relation .  Some of the various    B  S   (  m  ,  n  )       B  S   m  n     BS(m,n)   are well-known groups.    B  S   (  1  ,  1  )       B  S   1  1     BS(1,1)   is the free abelian group on two generators , and    B  S   (  1  ,   −  1   )       B  S   1    normal-−  1      BS(1,−1)   is the fundamental group of the Klein bottle .  The groups were defined by Gilbert Baumslag and Donald Solitar in 1962 to provide examples of non- Hopfian groups. The groups contain residually finite groups, Hopfian groups that are not residually finite, and non-Hopfian groups.  Linear representation  Define        A  =   (     1    1      0    1     )    ,   B  =   (       n  m      0      0    1     )     .     formulae-sequence    A    1  1    0  1       B      n  m   0    0  1       A=\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\
 0&1\end{pmatrix},\qquad B=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{n}{m}&0\\
 0&1\end{pmatrix}.     The matrix group   G   G   G   generated by   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   is a homomorphic image of    B  S   (  m  ,  n  )       B  S   m  n     BS(m,n)   , via the homomorphism induced by        a  ↦  A   ,   b  ↦  B    .     formulae-sequence   maps-to  a  A    maps-to  b  B     a\mapsto A,\qquad b\mapsto B.     It is worth noting that this will not, in general, be an isomorphism. For instance if    B  S   (  m  ,  n  )       B  S   m  n     BS(m,n)   is not residually finite (i.e. if it is not the case that     |  m  |   =  1        m   1    |m|=1   ,     |  n  |   =  1        n   1    |n|=1   , or     |  m  |   =   |  n  |         m     n     |m|=|n|    1 ) it cannot be isomorphic to a finitely generated linear group , which is known to be residually finite by a theorem of Mal'cev. 2  Notes    References    Gilbert Baumslag and Donald Solitar, Some two-generator one-relator non-Hopfian groups , Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 68 (1962), 199–201.
