   Star-free language      Star-free language   A regular language is said to be star-free if it can be described by a regular expression constructed from the letters of the alphabet , the empty set symbol, all boolean operators – including complementation – and concatenation but no Kleene star . 1 For instance, the language of words over the alphabet    {  a  ,  b  }     a  b    \{a,\,b\}   that do not have consecutive a's can be defined by     (    ∅  c   a  a   ∅  c    )   c     superscript     superscript   c   a  a   superscript   c    c    (\emptyset^{c}aa\emptyset^{c})^{c}   , where    X  c     superscript  X  c    X^{c}   denotes the complement of a subset   X   X   X   of     {  a  ,  b  }   *     superscript   a  b      \{a,\,b\}^{*}   . The condition is equivalent to having generalized star height zero.  Marcel-Paul Schützenberger characterized star-free languages as those with aperiodic  syntactic monoids . 2 3 They can also be characterized logically as languages definable in FO[ as the counter-free languages 4 and as languages definable in linear temporal logic . 5  All star-free languages are in uniform AC 0 .
