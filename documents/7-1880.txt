Star-free language

A regular language is said to be star-free if it can be described by a regular expression constructed from the letters of the alphabet, the empty set symbol, all boolean operators – including complementation – and concatenation but no Kleene star.1 For instance, the language of words over the alphabet 
 
 
 
  that do not have consecutive a's can be defined by 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the complement of a subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 . The condition is equivalent to having generalized star height zero.
Marcel-Paul Schützenberger characterized star-free languages as those with aperiodic syntactic monoids.23 They can also be characterized logically as languages definable in FO[ as the counter-free languages4 and as languages definable in linear temporal logic.5
All star-free languages are in uniform AC0.
