   Rogers–Szegő polynomials      Rogers–Szegő polynomials   In mathematics, the Rogers–Szegő polynomials are a family of polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle introduced by , who was inspired by the continuous q -Hermite polynomials studied by Leonard James Rogers . They are given by        h  n    (  x  ;  q  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   n       (  q  ;  q  )   n      (  q  ;  q  )   k     (  q  ;  q  )    n  -  k       x  k            subscript  h  n    x  q      superscript   subscript     k  0    n        subscript   q  q   n      subscript   q  q   k    subscript   q  q     n  k       superscript  x  k       h_{n}(x;q)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{(q;q)_{n}}{(q;q)_{k}(q;q)_{n-k}}x^{k}   where ( q ; q ) n is the descending q-Pochhammer symbol .
