   (hydroxyamino)benzene mutase      (hydroxyamino)benzene mutase   In enzymology , a (hydroxyamino)benzene mutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (hydroxyamino)benzene   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-aminophenol   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (hydroxyamino)benzene , and one product , 2-aminophenol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring hydroxy groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (hydroxyamino)benzene hydroxymutase . Other names in common use include HAB mutase , hydroxylaminobenzene hydroxymutase , and hydroxylaminobenzene mutase . This enzyme participates in naphthalene and anthracene degradation .  References      "  Category:EC 5.4.4  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
