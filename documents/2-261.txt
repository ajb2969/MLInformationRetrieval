   Palindromic number      Palindromic number   A palindromic number or numeral palindrome is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. Like 16461, for example, it is "symmetrical". The term palindromic is derived from palindrome , which refers to a word (such as rotor or racecar ) whose spelling is unchanged when its letters are reversed. The first 30 palindromic numbers (in decimal ) are:   0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, … .   Palindromic numbers receive most attention in the realm of recreational mathematics . A typical problem asks for numbers that possess a certain property and are palindromic. For instance:   The palindromic primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, … .  The palindromic square numbers are 0, 1, 4, 9, 121, 484, 676, 10201, 12321, … .   Buckminster Fuller referred to palindromic numbers as Scheherazade numbers in his book Synergetics , because Scheherazade was the name of the story-telling wife in the 1001 Nights .  It is fairly straightforward to appreciate that in any base there are infinitely many palindromic numbers, since in any base the infinite sequence of numbers written (in that base) as 101, 1001, 10001, etc. (in which the n th number is a 1, followed by n zeros, followed by a 1) consists of palindromic numbers only.  Formal definition  Although palindromic numbers are most often considered in the decimal system, the concept of palindromicity can be applied to the natural numbers in any numeral system . Consider a number n > 0 in base  b ≥ 2, where it is written in standard notation with k +1 digits  a i as:      n  =    ∑   i  =  0   k     a  i    b  i         n    superscript   subscript     i  0    k      subscript  a  i    superscript  b  i       n=\sum_{i=0}^{k}a_{i}b^{i}   with, as usual, 0 ≤ a i  k ≠ 0. Then n is palindromic if and only if a i = a k − i for all i . Zero is written 0 in any base and is also palindromic by definition.  Decimal palindromic numbers  All numbers in base 10 with one digit are palindromic. The number of palindromic numbers with two digits is 9:   {11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99}.   There are 90 palindromic numbers with three digits (Using the Rule of product : 9 choices for the first digit - which determines the third digit as well - multiplied by 10 choices for the second digit):   {101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, …, 909, 919, 929, 939, 949, 959, 969, 979, 989, 999}   and also 90 palindromic numbers with four digits: (Again, 9 choices for the first digit multiplied by ten choices for the second digit. The other two digits are determined by the choice of the first two)   {1001, 1111, 1221, 1331, 1441, 1551, 1661, 1771, 1881, 1991, …, 9009, 9119, 9229, 9339, 9449, 9559, 9669, 9779, 9889, 9999},   so there are 199 palindromic numbers below 10 4 . Below 10 5 there are 1099 palindromic numbers and for other exponents of 10 n we have: 1999, 10999, 19999, 109999, 199999, 1099999, … . For some types of palindromic numbers these values are listed below in a table.

Palindromic squares : 0, 1, 4, 9, 121, 484, 676, 10201, 12321, 14641, 40804, 44944, ...  Palindromic cubes : 0, 1, 8, 343, 1331, 1030301, 1367631, 1003003001, ...  Palindromic fourth powers : 0, 1, 14641, 104060401, 1004006004001, ...   The only known non-palindromic number whose cube is a palindrome is 2201, and it is a conjecture the fourth root of all the palindrome fourth powers are a palindrome with 100000...000001 (10 n + 1).  G. J. Simmons conjectured there are no palindromes of form n k for k > 4 (and n > 1). 1  Other bases  Palindromic numbers can be considered in other numeral systems than decimal . For example, the binary palindromic numbers are:   0, 1, 11, 101, 111, 1001, 1111, 10001, 10101, 11011, 11111, 100001, …   or in decimal: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 17, 21, 27, 31, 33, … . The Fermat primes and the Mersenne primes form a subset of the binary palindromic primes.  All numbers are palindromic in an infinite number of bases. But, it's more interesting to consider bases smaller than the number itself - in which case most numbers are palindromic in more than one base,for example,     1221  4   =   151  8   =   77  14   =   55  20   =   33  34   =   11  104          subscript  1221  4    subscript  151  8         subscript  77  14         subscript  55  20         subscript  33  34         subscript  11  104      1221_{4}=151_{8}=77_{14}=55_{20}=33_{34}=11_{104}   ,     1991  10   =   7  C   7  16         subscript  1991  10     7  C   subscript  7  16      1991_{10}=7C7_{16}     In base 18 , some powers of seven are palindromic:      7 0   =   1     7 1   =   7     7 3   =   111     7 4   =   777     7 6   =   12321     7 9   =   1367631     And in base 24 the first eight powers of five are palindromic as well:      5 0   =   1     5 1   =   5     5 2   =   11     5 3   =   55     5 4   =   121     5 5   =   5A5     5 6   =   1331     5 7   =   5FF5     5 8   =   14641     5 A   =   15AA51     5 C   =   16FLF61     Any number n is palindromic in all bases b with b ≥ n + 1 (trivially so, because n is then a single-digit number), and also in base n −1 (because n is then 11 n −1 ).
