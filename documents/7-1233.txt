Particular values of the Gamma function

The Gamma function is an important special function in mathematics. Its particular values can be expressed in closed form for integer and half-integer arguments, but no simple expressions are known for the values at rational points in general. Other fractional arguments can be approximated through efficient infinite products, infinite series, and recurrence relations.
Integers and half-integers
For positive integer arguments, the Gamma function coincides with the factorial, that is,



and hence



For non-positive integers, the Gamma function is not defined.
For positive half-integers, the function values are given exactly by



or equivalently, for non-negative integer values of n:



where n!! denotes the double factorial. In particular,




































































and by means of the reflection formula,





















































General rational arguments
In analogy with the half-integer formula,



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the k:th multifactorial of n. Numerically,

















 
  .
It is unknown whether these constants are transcendental in general, but 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  were shown to be transcendental by G. V. Chudnovsky. 
 
 
 
  has also long been known to be transcendental, and Yuri Nesterenko proved in 1996 that 
 
 
 
 , and  are algebraically independent.
The number

and it has been conjectured by Gramain that



where δ is the Masser-Gramain constant , although numerical work by Melquiond et al. indicates that this conjecture is false.1
Borwein and Zucker have found that 
 
 
 
  can be expressed algebraically in terms of

  where 
 
 
 
  is a complete elliptic integral of the first kind. This permits efficiently approximating the Gamma function of rational arguments to high precision using quadratically convergent arithmetic-geometric mean iterations. No similar relations are known for 
 
 
 
  or other denominators.
In particular, 
 
 
 
  is given by



Other formulas include the infinite products



and



where A is the Glaisher-Kinkelin constant and G is Catalan's constant.
C. H. Brown derived rapidly converging infinite series for particular values of the gamma function:2



where,

Other constants
The Gamma function has a local minimum on the positive real axis



with the value


 
  .
Integrating the reciprocal Gamma function along the positive real axis also gives the Fransén-Robinson constant.
On the negative real axis, the first local maxima and minima (zeros of the Digamma function) are:
