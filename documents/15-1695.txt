Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 4-phosphatase

Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 4-phosphatase (, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 4-phosphatase I, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 4-phosphatase II, type I PtdIns-4,5-P2 4-Ptase, type II PtdIns-4,5-P2 4-Ptase, IpgD, PtdIns-4,5-P2 4-phosphatase type I, PtdIns-4,5-P2 4-phosphatase type II, type I phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 4-phosphatase, type 1 4-phosphatase) is an enzyme with system name 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate 4-phosphohydrolase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 5-phosphate + phosphate


This enzyme participates in one of the mammalian pathways for degradation of 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2].
