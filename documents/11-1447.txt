Carbamate kinase

In enzymology, a carbamate kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + NH3 + CO2

 
  ADP + carbamoyl phosphate
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, NH3, and CO2, whereas its two products are ADP and carbamoyl phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a carboxy group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:carbamate phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include CKase, carbamoyl phosphokinase, and carbamyl phosphokinase. This enzyme participates in 4 metabolic pathways: purine metabolism, glutamate metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
