   (deoxy)adenylate kinase      (deoxy)adenylate kinase   In enzymology , a (deoxy)adenylate kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + dAMP   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + dADP   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and dAMP , whereas its two products are ADP and dADP .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with a phosphate group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:(d)AMP phosphotransferase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .
