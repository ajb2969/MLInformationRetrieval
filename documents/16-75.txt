Exo-alpha-bergamotene synthase

Exo-alpha-bergamotene synthase (, trans-alpha-bergamotene synthase, LaBERS (gene)) is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate lyase (cyclizing, (-)-exo-alpha-bergamotene-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (-)-exo-alpha-bergamotene + diphosphate


The enzyme synthesizes a mixture of sesquiterpenoids from (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate.
