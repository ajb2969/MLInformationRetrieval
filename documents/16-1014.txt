   G-domain      G-domain   In mathematics , an integral domain    D   D   D   is a G-domain if and only if:   Its quotient field is a simple extension of   D   D   D     Its quotient field is a finite extension of   D   D   D     Intersection of its nonzero prime ideals (not to be confused with nilradical ) is nonempty  There is an element   u   u   u   such that for any ideal   I   I   I   ,     u  n   ∈  I       superscript  u  n   I    u^{n}\in I   for some   n   n   n   . 1   A G-ideal is defined as an ideal    I  ⊂  R      I  R    I\subset R   such that    R  /  I      R  I    R/I   is a G-domain. Since a factor ring is an integral domain if and only if the ring is factored by a prime ideal, every G-ideal is also a prime ideal. G-ideals can be used as a refined collection of prime ideals in the following sense: Radical can be characterized as the intersection of all prime ideals containing the ideal, and in fact we still get the radical even if we take the intersection over the G-ideals. 2  Every maximal ideal is a G-ideal, since quotient by maximal ideal is a field, and a field is trivially a G-domain. Therefore, maximal ideals are G-ideals, and G-ideals are prime ideals. G-ideals are the only maximal ideals in Jacobson ring , and in fact this is an equivalent characterization of a Jacobson ring: a ring is a Jacobson ring when all maximal ideals are G-ideals. This leads to a simplified proof of the Nullstellensatz . 3  It is known that given    T  ⊃  R      R  T    T\supset R   , a ring extension of a G-domain,   T   T   T   is algebraic over   R   R   R   if and only if every ring extension between   T   T   T   and   R   R   R   is a G-domain. 4  A Noetherian domain is a G-domain iff its rank is at most one, and has only finitely many maximal ideals (or equivalently, prime ideals). 5  References  "  Category:Ring theory     Kaplansky, Irving.
