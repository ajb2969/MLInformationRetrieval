   Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase      Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase   In enzymology , a pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-proline + NAD(P)+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-proline , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-proline:NAD(P)+ 5-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include proline oxidase , L-proline oxidase , 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase , NADPH-L-Delta1-pyrroline carboxylic acid reductase , and L-proline-NAD(P)+ 5-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism.  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
