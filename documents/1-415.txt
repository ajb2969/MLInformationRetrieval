Finite field

In mathematics, a finite field or Galois field (so-named in honor of Évariste Galois) is a field that contains a finite number of elements. As with any field, a finite field is a set on which the operations of multiplication, addition, subtraction and division are defined and satisfy certain basic rules. The most common examples of finite fields are given by the integers mod n when n is a prime number.
The number of elements of a finite field is called its order. A finite field of order 
 
 
 
  exists if and only if the order 
 
 
 
  is a prime power  (where 
 
 
 
  is a prime number and 
 
 
 
 
  is a positive integer). All fields of a given order are isomorphic. In a field of order , adding 
 
 
 
  copies of any element always results in zero; that is, the characteristic of the field is 
 
 
 
 .
In a finite field of order 
 
 
 
 , the polynomial  has all q elements of the finite field as roots. The non-zero elements of a finite field form a multiplicative group. This group is cyclic, so all non-zero elements can be expressed as powers of a single element called a primitive element of the field (in general there will be several primitive elements for a given field.)
A field has, by definition, a commutative multiplication operation. A more general algebraic structure that satisfies all the other axioms of a field but isn't required to have a commutative multiplication is called a division ring (or sometimes skewfield). A finite division ring is a finite field by Wedderburn's little theorem. This result shows that the finiteness condition in the definition of a finite field can have algebraic consequences.
Finite fields are fundamental in a number of areas of mathematics and computer science, including number theory, algebraic geometry, Galois theory, finite geometry, cryptography and coding theory.
Definitions, first examples, and basic properties
A finite field is a finite set on which the four operations multiplication, addition, subtraction and division (excluding by zero) are defined, satisfying the rules of arithmetic known as the field axioms. The simplest examples of finite fields are the prime fields: for each prime number

 
 , the field 
 
 
 
 
  (also denoted 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , or ) of order (that is, size) 
 
 
 
  is easily constructed as the integers modulo 
 
 
.
The elements of a prime field may be represented by integers in the range 
 
 
 
 
 . The sum, the difference and the product are computed by taking the remainder by 
 
 
 
  of the integer result. The multiplicative inverse of an element may be computed by using the extended Euclidean algorithm (see ).
Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite field. For any element 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and any integer

 
 
 , let us denote by 
 
 
 
  the sum of 
 
 
 
  copies of 
 
 
 
 . The least positive 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
  must exist and is prime; it is called the characteristic of the field.
If the characteristic of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , the operation 
 
 
 
  makes 
 
 
 
  a 
 
 
 
 
 -vector space. It follows that the number of elements of 
 
 
 
  is .
For every prime number 
 
 
 
  and every positive integer 
 
 
 
 , there are finite fields of order , and all these fields are isomorphic (see  below). One may therefore identify all fields of order , which are therefore unambiguously denoted 
 
 
 
 ,  or , where the letters GF stand for "Galois field".1
The identity





is true (for every 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ) in a field of characteristic 
 
 
 
 . (This follows from the fact that all, except the first and the last, binomial coefficients of the expansion of 
 
 
 
  are multiples of 
 
 
 
 
 ).
For every element 
 
 
 
  in the prime field 
 
 
 
 , one has  (This is an immediate consequence of Fermat's little theorem, and this may be easily proved as follows: the equality is trivially true for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ; one obtains the result for the other elements of 
 
 
 
 
  by applying the above identity to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  successively takes the values 
 
 
 
  modulo 
 
 
 
 
 .) This implies the equality


 
  for polynomials over 
 
 
 
 . More generally, every element in  satisfies the polynomial equation .
Any finite field extension of a finite field is separable and simple. That is, if E is a finite field and F is a subfield of E, then E is obtained from F by adjoining a single element whose minimal polynomial is separable. To use a jargon, finite fields are perfect.
Existence and uniqueness
Let  be a prime power, and 
 
 
 
  be the splitting field of the polynomial


 
  over the prime field 
 
 
 
 
 . This means that 
 
 
 
  is a finite field of lowest order, in which 
 
 
 
  has 
 
 
 
  distinct roots (the roots are distinct, as the formal derivative of 
 
 
 
  is equal to 
 
 
 
 
 ). Above identity shows that the sum and the product of two roots of 
 
 
 
  are roots of 
 
 
 
 , as well as the multiplicative inverse of a root of 
 
 
 
 . In other word, the roots of 
 
 
 
  form a field of order 
 
 
 
 
 , which is equal to 
 
 
 
  by the minimality of the splitting field.
The uniqueness up to isomorphism of splitting fields implies thus that all fields of order 
 
 
 
  are isomorphic.
In summary, we have the following classification theorem first proved in 1893 by E. H. Moore:2


The order of a finite field is a prime power. For every prime power

there are fields of order

 
 , and they are all isomorphic. In these fields, every element satisfies




and the polynomial

factors as







It follows that  contains a subfield isomorphic to  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a divisor of 
 
 
 
 ; in that case, this subfield is unique. In fact, the polynomial 
 
 
 
 
  divides 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a divisor of 
 
 
 
 .
Explicit construction of finite fields
Non-prime fields
Given a prime power  with 
 
 
 
  prime and 
 
 
 
 
 , the field 
 
 
 
  may be explicitly constructed in the following way. One chooses first an irreducible polynomial

 
  in 
 
 
 
  of degree 
 
 
 
  (such an irreducible polynomial always exists). Then the quotient ring


 
  of the polynomial ring 
 
 
 
  by the ideal generated by 
 
 
 
  is a field of order 
 
 
 
 .
More explicitly, the elements of 
 
 
 
  are the polynomials over 
 
 
 
 
  whose degree is strictly less than 
 
 
 
 . The addition and the subtraction are those of polynomials over 
 
 
 
 . The product of two elements is the remainder of the Euclidean division by 
 
 
 
  of the product in 
 
 
 
 . The multiplicative inverse of a non-zero element may be computed with the extended Euclidean algorithm; see Extended Euclidean algorithm § Simple algebraic field extensions.
Except in the construction of 
 
 
 
 
 , there are several possible choices for 
 
 
 
 , which produce isomorphic results. To simplify the Euclidean division, for 
 
 
 
  one commonly chooses polynomials of the form


 
  which make the needed Euclidean divisions very efficient. However, for some fields, typically in characteristic 2, irreducible polynomials of the form 
 
 
 
  may not exist. In characteristic 2, if the polynomial  is reducible, it is recommended to choose  with the lowest possible 
 
 
 
 
  that makes the polynomial irreducible. If all these trinomials are reducible, one chooses "pentanomials" , as polynomials of degree greater than 1, with an even number of terms, are never irreducible in characteristic 2, having 1 as a root.3
In the next sections, we will show how this general construction method works for small finite fields.
Field with four elements
Over 
 
 
 
 , there is only one irreducible polynomial of degree 2:


 
  Therefore, for 
 
 
 
  the construction of the preceding section must involve this polynomial, and



If one denotes 
 
 
 
 
  a root of this polynomial in 
 
 
 
 , the tables of the operations in 
 
 
 
  are the following. There is no table for subtraction, as, in every field of characteristic 2, subtraction is identical to addition. In the third table, for the division of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  must be read on the left, and 
 
 
 
  on the top.

GF(p2) for an odd prime p
For applying above general construction of finite fields in the case of , one has to find an irreducible polynomial of degree 2. For 
 
 
 
 , this has been done in the preceding section. If 
 
 
 
  is an odd prime, there are always irreducible polynomials of the form , with 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 
 .
More precisely, the polynomial  is irreducible over 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic non-residue modulo 
 
 
 
  (this is almost the definition of a quadratic non-residue). There are 
 
 
 
  quadratic non-residues modulo 
 
 
 
 
 . For example, 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic non-residue for 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic non-residue for 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
 
 , that is 
 
 
 
 , one may choose 
 
 
 
  as a quadratic non-residue, which allows us to have a very simple irreducible polynomial .
Having chosen a quadratic non-residue 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be a symbolic square root of 
 
 
 
 
 , that is a symbol which has the property , in the same way as the complex number 
 
 
 
  is a symbolic square root of 
 
 
 
 . Then, the elements of  are all the linear expressions


 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . The operations on  are defined as follows (the operations between elements of 
 
 
 
  represented by Latin letters are the operations in 
 
 
 
 ):



GF(8) and GF(27)
The polynomial


 
  is irreducible over 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , that is, it is irreducible modulo 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  (to show this it suffice to show that it has no root in 
 
 
 
  nor in 
 
 
 
 ). It follows that the elements of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  may be represented by expressions


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are elements of 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  (respectively), and 
 
 
 
  is a symbol such that



The addition, additive inverse and multiplication on 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  may thus be defined as follows; in following formulas, the operations between elements of 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 , represented by Latin letters are the operations in 
 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 , respectively:



GF(16)
The polynomial


 
  is irreducible over 
 
 
 
 , that is, it is irreducible modulo 
 
 
 
 . It follows that the elements of 
 
 
 
  may be represented by expressions


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are either 0 or 1 (elements of 
 
 
 
 ), and 
 
 
 
  is a symbol such that



As the characteristic of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , each element is its additive inverse in GF(16). The addition and multiplication on 
 
 
 
  may be defined as follows; in following formulas, the operations between elements of 
 
 
 
 , represented by Latin letters are the operations in 
 
 
 
 .



Multiplicative structure
The set of non-zero elements in 
 
 
 
 
  is an Abelian group under the multiplication, of order 
 
 
 
 . By Lagrange's theorem, there exists a divisor 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that  for every non-zero 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 
 . As the equation  has at most 
 
 
 
  solutions in any field, 
 
 
 
  is the lowest possible value for 
 
 
 
 . The structure theorem of finite Abelian groups implies that this multiplicative group is cyclic, that all non-zero elements are powers of single element. In summary:

The multiplicative group of the non-zero elements in

is cyclic, and there exist an element

 
 
 , such that the

non-zero elements of

are .
 

Such an element 
 
 
 
  is called a primitive element. Unless 
 
 
 
 , the primitive element is not unique. The number of primitive elements is 
 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is Euler's totient function.
Above result implies that  for every 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . The particular case where 
 
 
 
  is prime is Fermat's little theorem.
Discrete logarithm
If 
 
 
 
 
  is a primitive element in 
 
 
 
 , then for any non-zero element 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , there is a unique integer 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 
  such that

 an}}.
 

This integer 
 
 
 
  is called the discrete logarithm of 
 
 
 
  to the base 
 
 
 
 .
While the computation of  is rather easy, by using, for example, exponentiation by squaring, the reciprocal operation, the computation of the discrete logarithm is difficult. This has been used in various cryptographic protocols, see Discrete logarithm for details.
When the nonzero elements of 
 
 
 
  are represented by their discrete logarithms, multiplication and division are easy, as they reduce to addition and subtraction modulo 
 
 
 
 
 . However, addition amounts to computing the discrete logarithm of . The identity




allows one to solve this problem by constructing the table of the discrete logarithms of , called Zech's logarithms, for 
 
 
 
  (it is convenient to define the discrete logarithm of zero as being 
 
 
 
 ).
Zech's logarithms are useful for large computations, such as linear algebra over medium-sized fields, that is, fields that are sufficiently large for making natural algorithms inefficient, but not too large, as one has to pre-compute a table of the same size as the order of the field.
Roots of unity
Every nonzero element of a finite field is a root of unity, as  for every nonzero element of 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is a positive integer, a 
 
 
 
 
 th primitive root of unity is a solution of the equation  1}} that is not a solution of the equation  1}} for any positive integer 
 
 

The field 
 
 
 
  contains a 
 
 
 
 th primitive root of unity if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a divisor of 
 
 
 
 
 ; if 
 
 
 
  is a divisor of 
 
 
 
 , then the number of primitive 
 
 
 
 th roots of unity in 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 
  (Euler's totient function). The number of 
 
 
 
 th roots of unity in 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 .
In a field of characteristic 
 
 
 
 , every 
 
 
 
 
 th root of unity is also a 
 
 
 
 th root of unity. It follows that primitive 
 
 
 
 th roots of unity never exist in a field of characteristic 
 
 
 
 .
On the other hand, if 
 
 
 
  is coprime to 
 
 
 
 
 , the roots of the 
 
 
 
 th cyclotomic polynomial are distinct in every field of characteristic 
 
 
 
 , as this polynomial is a divisor of , which has 
 
 
 
  as formal derivative. It follows that the 
 
 
 
 th cyclotomic polynomial factors over 
 
 
 
 
  into distinct irreducible polynomials that have all the same degree, say 
 
 
 
 , and that  is the smallest field of characteristic 
 
 
 
  that contains the 
 
 
 
 th primitive roots of unity.
Example
The field 
 
 
 
  has several interesting properties that smaller fields do not share. Specifically, it has two subfields such that neither is a subfield of the other, not all generators (elements having a minimal polynomial of degree 
 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
 ) are primitive elements, and the primitive elements are not all conjugate under the Galois group.
The order of this field being , and the divisors of 
 
 
 
  being 
 
 
 
 , the subfields of 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
 
 
 , , , and 
 
 
 
  itself. As 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are coprime, the intersection of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is the prime field 
 
 
 
 .
The union of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  has thus 
 
 
 
 
  elements. The remaining 
 
 
 
  elements of 
 
 
 
  generate 
 
 
 
  in the sense that no other subfield contains any of them. It follows that they are roots of irreducible polynomials of degree 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
 
 . This implies that, over 
 
 
 
 , there are exactly 
 
 
 
  irreducible monic polynomials of degree 
 
 
 
 . This may be verified by factoring  over 
 
 
 
 .
The elements of 
 
 
 
 
  are primitive 
 
 
 
 th roots of unity for some 
 
 
 
  dividing 
 
 
 
 . As the 3rd and the 7th roots of unity belong to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 , respectively, the 
 
 
 
  generators are primitive 
 
 
 
 th roots of unity for some 
 
 
 
  in . Euler's totient function shows that there are 
 
 
 
  primitive 
 
 
 
 
 th roots of unity, 
 
 
 
  primitive 
 
 
 
 st roots of unity, and 
 
 
 
  primitive 
 
 
 
 rd roots of unity. Summing these numbers, one finds again 
 
 
 
 
  elements.
By factoring the cyclotomic polynomials over 
 
 
 
 , one finds that:

The six primitive 
 
 
 
 th roots of unity are roots of








and are all conjugate under the action of the Galois group.
 


The twelve primitive 
 
 
 
 st roots of unity are roots of








They form two orbits under the action of the Galois group. As the two factors are reciprocal to each other, a root and its (multiplicative) inverse do not belong to the same orbit.
 


The 
 
 
 
  primitive elements of 
 
 
 
  are the roots of








They split into 6 orbits of 6 elements under the action of the Galois group.
 

This shows that the best choice to construct 
 
 
 
  is to define it as . In fact, this generator is a primitive element, and this polynomial is the irreducible polynomial that produces the easiest Euclidean division.
Frobenius automorphism and Galois theory
In this section, 
 
 
 
 
  is a prime number, and  is a power of 
 
 
 
 .
In 
 
 
 
 , the identity 
 
 
 
  implies that the map


 
  is a 
 
 
 
 
 -linear endomorphism and a field automorphism of 
 
 
 
 , which fixes every element of the subfield 
 
 
 
 . It is called the Frobenius automorphism, after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius.
Denoting by 
 
 
 
  the composition of 
 
 
 
  with itself, 
 
 
 
  times, we have


 
  It has been shown in the preceding section that 
 
 
 
  is the identity. For 
 
 



 
 
  would have more than  roots.
There are no other 
 
 
 
 -automorphisms of 
 
 
 
 . In other words,  has exactly 
 
 

 
 -automorphisms, which are



In terms of Galois theory, this means that  is a Galois extension of 
 
 
 
 , which has a cyclic Galois group.
The fact that the Frobenius map is surjective implies that every finite field is perfect.
Polynomial factorization
If 
 
 
 
  is a finite field, a non-constant monic polynomial with coefficients in 
 
 
 
  is irreducible over 
 
 
 
 , if it is not the product of two non-constant monic polynomials, with coefficients in 
 
 
 
 
 .
As every polynomial ring over a field is a unique factorization domain, every monic polynomial over a finite field may be factored in a unique way (up to the order of the factors) into a product of irreducible monic polynomials.
There are efficient algorithms for testing polynomial irreducibility and factoring polynomials over finite field. They are a key step for factoring polynomials over the integers or the rational numbers. At least for this reason, every computer algebra system has functions for factoring polynomials over finite fields, or, at least, over finite prime fields.
Irreducible polynomials of a given degree
The polynomial


 
  factors into linear factors over a field of order 
 
 
 
 . More precisely, this polynomial is the product of all monic polynomials of degree one over a field of order 
 
 
 
 .
This implies that, if  that  is the product of all monic irreducible polynomials over 
 
 
 
 , whose degree divides 
 
 
 
 
 . In fact, if 
 
 
 
  is an irreducible factor over 
 
 
 
  of , its degree divides 
 
 
 
 , as its splitting field is contained in . Conversely, if 
 
 
 
  is an irreducible monic polynomial over 
 
 
 
 
  of degree 
 
 
 
  dividing 
 
 
 
 , it defines a field extension of degree 
 
 
 
 , which is contained in , and all roots of 
 
 
 
  belong to , and are roots of ; thus 
 
 
 
 
  divides . As  does not have any multiple factor, it is thus the product of all the irreducible monic polynomials that divide it.
This property is used to compute the product of the irreducible factors of each degree of polynomials over 
 
 
 
 ; see Distinct degree factorization.
Number of monic irreducible polynomials of a given degree over a finite field
The number 
 
 
 
  of monic irreducible polynomials of degree 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  is given by4



where 
 
 
 
  is the Möbius function. This formula is almost a direct consequence of above property of .
By the above formula, the number of irreducible (not necessarily monic) polynomials of degree 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 .
A (slightly simpler) lower bound for 
 
 
 
 
  is



One may easily deduce that, for every 
 
 
 
  and every 
 
 
 
 , there is at least one irreducible polynomial of degree 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
 
 . This lower bound is sharp for 
 
 
 
 .
Applications
In cryptography, the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem in finite fields or in elliptic curves is the basis of several widely used protocols, such as the Diffie–Hellman protocol. For example, in 2014, the secure connection to Wikipedia involves the elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman protocol (ECDHE) over a large finite field.5 In coding theory, many codes are constructed as subspaces of vector spaces over finite fields.
Finite fields are widely used in number theory, as many problems over the integers may be solved by reducing them modulo one or several prime numbers. For example, the fastest known algorithms for polynomial factorization and linear algebra over the field of rational numbers proceed by reduction modulo one or several primes, and then reconstruction of the solution by using Chinese remainder theorem, Hensel lifting or the LLL algorithm.
Similarly many theoretical problems in number theory can be solved by considering their reductions modulo some or all prime numbers. See, for example, Hasse principle. Many recent developments of algebraic geometry were motivated by the need to enlarge the power of these modular methods. Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is an example of a deep result involving many mathematical tools, including finite fields.
Extensions
Algebraic closure
A finite field 
 
 
 
  is not algebraically closed. To demonstrate this, consider the polynomial


 
  which has no roots in 
 
 
 
 , since 
 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
The direct limit of the system:




with inclusion, is an infinite field. It is the algebraic closure of all the fields in the system, and is denoted by
 
 
 
 .
The inclusions commute with the Frobenius map, as it is defined the same way on each field (), so the Frobenius map defines an automorphism of 
 
 
 
 , which carries all subfields back to themselves. In fact  can be recovered as the fixed points of the 
 
 
 
 
 th iterate of the Frobenius map.
However unlike the case of finite fields, the Frobenius automorphism on 
 
 
 
  has infinite order, and it does not generate the full group of automorphisms of this field. That is, there are automorphisms of 
 
 
 
  which are not a power of the Frobenius map. However, the group generated by the Frobenius map is a dense subgroup of the automorphism group in the Krull topology. Algebraically, this corresponds to the additive group 
 
 
 
  being dense in the profinite integers (direct product of the 
 
 
 
 -adic integers over all primes 
 
 
 
 
 , with the product topology).
If we actually construct our finite fields in such a fashion that  is contained in  whenever $n$ divides $m$, then this direct limit can be constructed as the union of all these fields. Even if we do not construct our fields this way, we can still speak of the algebraic closure, but some more delicacy is required in its construction.
Wedderburn's little theorem
A division ring is a generalization of field. Division rings are not assumed to be commutative. There are no non-commutative finite division rings: Wedderburn's little theorem states that all finite division rings are commutative, hence finite fields. The result holds even if we relax associativity and consider alternative rings, by the Artin–Zorn theorem.
