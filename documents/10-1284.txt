   Formate dehydrogenase (cytochrome)      Formate dehydrogenase (cytochrome)   In enzymology , a formate dehydrogenase (cytochrome) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   formate + 2 ferricytochrome b 1    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CO 2 + 2 ferrocytochrome b 1 + 2 H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are formate and ferricytochrome b1 , whereas its 3 products are CO 2 , ferrocytochrome b1 , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with a cytochrome as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is formate:ferricytochrome-b1 oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include formate dehydrogenase , and formate:cytochrome b1 oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.2.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
