   Tarski monster group      Tarski monster group   In the area of modern algebra known as group theory , a Tarski monster group , named for Alfred Tarski , is an infinite group  G , such that every proper subgroup H of G , other than the identity subgroup, is a cyclic group of order a fixed prime number  p . A Tarski monster group is necessarily simple . It was shown by A. Yu. Olshanskii in 1979 that Tarski groups exist, and that there is a Tarski p -group for every prime p > 10 75 . They are a source of counterexamples to conjectures in group theory , most importantly to Burnside's problem and the von Neumann conjecture .  Definition  Let $p$ be a fixed prime number. An infinite group $G$ is called a Tarski Monster group for $p$ if every nontrivial subgroup (i.e. every subgroup other than 1 and G itself) has $p$ elements.  Properties   $G$ is necessarily finitely generated. In fact it is generated by every two non-commuting elements.  $G$ is simple. If $N\trianglelefteq G$ and $U\leq G$ is any subgroup distinct from $N$ the subgroup $NU$ would have $p^2$ elements.  The construction of Ol'shanskii shows in fact that there are continuum-many non-isomorphic Tarski Monster groups for each prime $p>10^{75}$ .   References   A. Yu.
