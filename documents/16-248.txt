(S)-beta-macrocarpene synthase

(S)-beta-macrocarpene synthase (, TPS6, TPS11) is an enzyme with system name (S)-beta-macrocarpene lyase (decyclizing).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(S)-beta-bisabolene 
 
 
 
  (S)-beta-macrocarpene
 

The synthesis of (S)-beta-macrocarpene from (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate proceeds in two steps.
