   Mordell curve      Mordell curve   (Figure)  y 2 = x 3 + 1 , with solutions at ( -1 , 0 ), ( 0 , 1 ) and ( 0 , -1 )   In algebra , a Mordell curve is an elliptic curve of the form y 2 = x 3 + n , where n is a fixed non-zero integer . 1  These curves were closely studied by Louis Mordell , 2 from the point of view of determining their integer points. He showed that every Mordell curve contains only finitely many integer points ( x , y ). In other words, the differences of perfect squares and perfect cubes tend to ∞. The question of how fast was dealt with in principle by Baker's method . Hypothetically this issue is dealt with by Marshall Hall's conjecture .  Properties  If ( x , y ) is an integer point on a Mordell curve, then so is ( x , -y ).  There are certain values of n for which the corresponding Mordell curve has no integer solutions, 3 these values are:   6, 7, 11, 13, 14, 20, 21, 23, 29, 32, 34, 39, 42, ... .   Example  Fermat proved that the only solutions of      m  2   +  2   =   n  3          superscript  m  2   2    superscript  n  3     m^{2}+2=n^{3}   are     n  =  3   ,   m  =   ±  5       formulae-sequence    n  3     m   plus-or-minus  5      n=3,m=\pm 5   .
