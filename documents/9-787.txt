Skew lattice

In abstract algebra, a skew lattice is an algebraic structure that is a non-commutative generalization of a lattice. While the term skew lattice can be used to refer to any non-commutative generalization of a lattice, over the past twenty years it has been used primarily as follows.
Definition
A skew lattice is a set S equipped with two associative, idempotent binary operations

 
  and 
 
 
 
 , called meet and join, that satisfy the following dual pair of absorption laws



 
  and 
 
 
 
 .

Given that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are associative and idempotent, these identities are equivalent to the dualities:



 
  iff 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  iff

Historical background
For over 60 years, noncommutative variations of lattices have been studied with differing motivations. For some the motivation has been an interest in the conceptual boundaries of lattice theory; for others it was a search for noncommutative forms of logic and Boolean algebra; and for others it has been the behavior of idempotents in rings. A noncommutative lattice, generally speaking, is an algebra

 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are associative, idempotent binary operations connected by absorption identities guaranteeing that 
 
 
 
  in some way dualizes 
 
 
 
 . The precise identities chosen depends upon the underlying motivation, with differing choices producing distinct varieties of algebras. Pascual Jordan, motivated by questions in quantum logic, initiated a study of noncommutative lattices in his 1949 paper, Über Nichtkommutative Verbande,2 choosing the absorption identities





He referred to those algebras satisfying them as Schrägverbände. By varying or augmenting these identities, Jordan and others obtained a number of varieties of noncommutative lattices. Beginning with Jonathan Leech's 1989 paper, Skew lattices in rings,3 skew lattices as defined above have been the primary objects of study. This was aided by previous results about bands. This was especially the case for many of the basic properties.
Basic properties
Natural partial order and natural quasiorder
In a skew lattice 
 
 
 
 , the natural partial order is deﬁned by 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 , or dually, 
 
 
 
 . The natural preorder on 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  or dually 
 
 
 
 . While 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  agree on lattices, 
 
 
 
  properly reﬁnes 
 
 
 
  in the noncommutative case. The induced natural equivalence

 
  is deﬁned by 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 , that is, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  or dually, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The blocks of the partition 
 
 
 
  are lattice ordered by 
 
 
 
  iﬀ 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  exist such that 
 
 
 
 . This permits us to write Hasse diagrams of skew lattices such as the following pair:

E.g., in the diagram on the left above, that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
 
  related is expressed by the dashed segment. The slanted lines reveal the natural partial order between elements of the distinct 
 
 
 
 -classes. The elements 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  form the singleton 
 
 
 
 -classes.
Rectangular Skew Lattices
Skew lattices consisting of a single 
 
 
 
 -class are called rectangular. They are characterized by the equivalent identities
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Rectangular skew lattices are isomorphic to skew lattices having the following construction (and conversely): given nonempty sets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , on 
 
 
 
  deﬁne 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The 
 
 
 
 -class partition of a skew lattice 
 
 
 
  , as indicated in the above diagrams, is the unique partition of 
 
 
 
  into its maximal rectangular subalgebras, Moreover, 
 
 
 
  is a congruence with the induced quotient algebra 
 
 
 
  being the maximal lattice image of 
 
 
 
  , thus making every skew lattice 
 
 
 
  a lattice of rectangular subalgebras. This is the Cliﬀord-McLean Theorem for skew lattices, ﬁrst given for bands separately by Cliﬀord and McLean. It is also known as the First Decomposition Theorem for skew lattices.
Right (left) handed skew lattices and the Kimura factorization
A skew lattice is right-handed if it satisﬁes the identity 
 
 
 
  or dually, 
 
 
 
 . These identities essentially assert that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in each 
 
 
 
 -class. Every skew lattice 
 
 
 
  has a unique maximal right-handed image 
 
 
 
  where the congruence 
 
 
 
  is deﬁned by 
 
 
 
  if both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 (or dually, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ). Likewise a skew lattice is left-handed if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in each 
 
 
 
 -class. Again the maximal left-handed image of a skew lattice 
 
 
 
  is the image 
 
 
 
  where the congruence 
 
 
 
  is deﬁned in dual fashion to 
 
 
 
 . Many examples of skew lattices are either right or left-handed. In the lattice of congruences, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the identity congruence 
 
 
 
 . The induced epimorphism 
 
 
 
  factors through both induced epimorphisms 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Setting 
 
 
 
 , the homomorphism 
 
 
 
 deﬁned by 
 
 
 
 , induces an isomorphism 
 
 
 
 . This is the Kimura factorization of 
 
 
 
  into a ﬁbred product of its maximal right and left-handed images.

Like the Cliﬀord-McLean Theorem, Kimura factorization (or the Second Decomposition Theorem for skew lattices) was ﬁrst given for regular bands (that satisfy the middle absorption identity, 
 
 
 
  ). Indeed both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are regular band operations. The above symbols 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  come, of course, from basic semigroup theory.

Subvarieties of skew lattices
Skew lattices form a variety. Rectangular skew lattices, left-handed and right-handed skew lattices all form subvarieties that are central to the basic structure theory of skew lattices. Here are several more.
Symmetric Skew Lattices
A skew lattice S is symmetric if for any 
 
 
 
  , 
 
 
 
  iﬀ 
 
 
 
 . Occurrences of commutation are thus unambiguous for such skew lattices, with subsets of pairwise commuting elements generating commutative subalgebras, i.e, sublattices. ( This is not true for skew lattices in general.) Equational bases for this subvariety, ﬁrst given by Spinks 12 are: 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . A lattice section of a skew lattice 
 
 
 
  is a sublattice 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  meeting each 
 
 
 
 -class of 
 
 
 
  at a single element. 
 
 
 
  is thus an internal copy of the lattice 
 
 
 
  with the composition 
 
 
 
  being an isomorphism. All symmetric skew lattices for which |S/D| \leq \aleph_0 , admit a lattice section.13 Symmetric or not, having a lattice section 
 
 
 
  guarantees that 
 
 
 
  also has internal copies of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  given respectively by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  congruence classes of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  . Thus 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are isomorphisms (See 14). This leads to a commuting diagram of embedding dualizing the preceding Kimura diagram.

Cancellative Skew Lattices
A skew lattice is cancellative if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  implies 
 
 
 
  and likewise 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  implies 
 
 
 
 . Cancellatice skew lattices are symmetric and can be shown to form a variety. Unlike lattices, they need not be distributive, and conversely.
Distributive Skew Lattices
Distributive skew lattices are determined by the identities: 
 
 
 
  (D1 ) 
 
 
 
  (D’1 )
Unlike lattices, (D1 ) and (D‘1 ) are not equivalent in general for skew lattices, but they are for symmetric skew lattices. (See,,.151617) The condition (D1 ) can be strengthened to 
 
 
 
  (D2 ) in which case (D‘1 ) is a consequence. A skew lattice 
 
 
 
  satisﬁes both (D2) and its dual, 
 
 
 
 , if and only if it factors as the product of a distributive lattice and a rectangular skew lattice. In this latter case (D2 ) can be strengthened to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . (D3 ) On its own, (D3 ) is equivalent to (D2 ) when symmetry is added. (See.18) We thus have six subvarieties of skew lattices determined respectively by (D1), (D2), (D3) and their duals.
Normal Skew Lattices
As seen above, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  satisfy the identity 
 
 
 
 . Bands satisfying the stronger identity, 
 
 
 
 , are called normal. A skew lattice is normal skew if it satisﬁes



For each element a in a normal skew lattice 
 
 
 
 , the set 
 
 
 
  deﬁned by { 
 
 
 
 } or equivalently {
 
 
 
 } is a sublattice of 
 
 
 
 , and conversely. (Thus normal skew lattices have also been called local lattices.) When both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are normal, 
 
 
 
  splits isomorphically into a product 
 
 
 
  of a lattice 
 
 
 
  and a rectangular skew lattice 
 
 
 
 , and conversely. Thus both normal skew lattices and split skew lattices form varieties. Returning to distribution, 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
  characterizes the variety of distributive, normal skew lattices, and (D3) characterizes the variety of symmetric, distributive, normal skew lattices.
Categorical Skew Lattices
A skew lattice is categorical if nonempty composites of coset bijections are coset bijections. Categorical skew lattices form a variety. Skew lattices in rings and normal skew lattices are examples of algebras on this variety.19 Let 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be the coset bijection from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  taking 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be the coset bijection from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  taking 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and ﬁnally 
 
 
 
  be the coset bijection from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  taking 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . A skew lattice 
 
 
 
  is categorical if one always has the equality 
 
 
 
 , ie. , if the composite partial bijection 
 
 
 
  if nonempty is a coset bijection from a 
 
 
 
  -coset of 
 
 
 
  to an 
 
 
 
 -coset of 
 
 
 
  . That is 
 
 
 
 . All distributive skew lattices are categorical. Though symmetric skew lattices might not be. In a sense they reveal the independence between the properties of symmetry and distributivity.

Skew Boolean algebras
A zero element in a skew lattice S is an element 0 of S such that for all 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  or, dually, 
 
 
 
 . (0)
A Boolean skew lattice is a symmetric, distributive normal skew lattice with 0, 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
  is a Boolean lattice for each 
 
 
 
 . Given such skew lattice S , a diﬀerence operator \ is deﬁned on 28 by x\ y = 
 
 
 
  where the latter is evaluated in the Boolean lattice 
 
 
 
 . In the presence of (D3) and (0), \ is characterized by the identities: 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  One thus has a variety of skew Boolean algebras 
 
 
 
  characterized by identities (D3), (0) and (S B). A primitive skew Boolean algebra consists of 0 and a single non-0 D-class. Thus it is the result of adjoining a 0 to a rectangular skew lattice D via (0) with 
 
 
 
 , if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  otherwise. Every skew Boolean algebra is a subdirect product of primitive algebras. Skew Boolean algebras play an important role in the study of discriminator varieties and other generalizations in universal algebra of Boolean behavior. For more details on skew Boolean algebras see 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 .39
Skew lattices in rings
Let 
 
 
 
  be a ring and let 
 
 
 
  denote the set of all Idempotents in 
 
 
 
 . For all 
 
 
 
  set 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Clearly 
 
 
 
  but also 
 
 
 
  is associative. If a subset 
 
 
 
  is closed under 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is a distributive, cancellative skew lattice. To ﬁnd such skew lattices in 
 
 
 
  one looks at bands in 
 
 
 
 , especially the ones that are maximal with respect to some constraint. In fact, every multiplicative band in 
 
 
 
  that is maximal with respect to being right regular (= ) is also closed under 
 
 
 
  and so forms a right-handed skew lattice. In general, every right regular band in 
 
 
 
  generates a right-handed skew lattice in 
 
 
 
 . Dual remarks also hold for left regular bands (bands satisfying the identity 
 
 
 
 ) in 
 
 
 
 . Maximal regular bands need not to be closed under 
 
 
 
  as deﬁned; counterexamples are easily found using multiplicative rectangular bands. These cases are closed, however, under the cubic variant of 
 
 
 
  deﬁned by 
 
 
 
  since in these cases 
 
 
 
  reduces to 
 
 
 
  to give the dual rectangular band. By replacing the condition of regularity by normality 
 
 
 
 , every maximal normal multiplicative band 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is also closed under 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , forms a Boolean skew lattice. When 
 
 
 
  itself is closed under multiplication, then it is a normal band and thus forms a Boolean skew lattice. In fact, any skew Boolean algebra can be embedded into such an algebra. (See.40) When A has a multiplicative identity 
 
 
 
 , the condition that 
 
 
 
  is multiplicatively closed is well-known to imply that 
 
 
 
  forms a Boolean algebra. Skew lattices in rings continue to be a good source of examples and motivation. For more details read.4142434445
Primitive skew lattices
Skew lattices consisting of exactly two D-classes are called primitive skew lattices. Given such a skew lattice 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 -classes 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , then for any 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the subsets


 
 {
 
 
 
 } 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  {
 
 
 
 } 
 
 

are called, respectively, cosets of A in B and cosets of B in A. These cosets partition B and A with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Cosets are always rectangular subalgebras in their 
 
 
 
 -classes. What is more, the partial order 
 
 
 
  induces a coset bijection 
 
 
 
  defined by:


 
  iff 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Collectively, coset bijections describe 
 
 
 
  between the subsets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . They also determine 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for pairs of elements from distinct 
 
 
 
 -classes. Indeed, given 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be the cost bijection between the cosets 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . Then:


 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
In general, given 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  belong to a common 
 
 
 
 - coset in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  belong to a common 
 
 
 
 -coset in 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 . Thus each coset bijection is, in some sense, a maximal collection of mutually parallel pairs 
 
 
 
 .
Every primitive skew lattice 
 
 
 
  factors as the fibred product of its maximal left and right- handed primitive images 
 
 
 
 . Right-handed primitive skew lattices are constructed as follows. Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be partitions of disjoint nonempty sets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  share a common size. For each pair 
 
 
 
  pick a fixed bijection 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  onto 
 
 
 
 . On 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  separately set 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ; but given 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , set


 
  and 
 
 

where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  belonging to the cell 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  belonging to the cell 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 . The various 
 
 
 
  are the coset bijections. This is illustrated in the following partial Hasse diagram where 
 
 
 
  and the arrows indicate the 
 
 
 
  -outputs and 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .

One constructs left-handed primitive skew lattices in dual fashion. All right [left] handed primitive skew lattices can be constructed in this fashion. (See 46 Section 1.)
The coset structure of skew lattices
A nonrectangular skew lattice 
 
 
 
  is covered by its maximal primitive skew lattices: given comparable 
 
 
 
 -classes 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  forms a maximal primitive subalgebra of 
 
 
 
  and every 
 
 
 
 -class in 
 
 
 
  lies in such a subalgebra. The coset structures on these primitive subalgebras combine to determine the outcomes 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  at least when 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are comparable under 
 
 
 
 . It turns out that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are determined in general by cosets and their bijections, although in a slightly less direct manner than the 
 
 
 
 -comparable case. In particular, given two incomparable D-classes A and B with join D-class J and meet D-class 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , interesting connections arise between the two coset decompositions of J (or M) with respect to A and B. (See 47 Section 3.)

Thus a skew lattice may be viewed as a coset atlas of rectangular skew lattices placed on the vertices of a lattice and coset bijections between them, the latter seen as partial isomorphisms between the rectangular algebras with each coset bijection determining a corresponding pair of cosets. This perspective gives, in essence, the Hasse diagram of the skew lattice, which is easily drawn in cases of relatively small order. (See the diagrams in Section 3 above.) Given a chain of D-classes 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , one has three sets of coset bijections: from A to B, from B to C and from A to C. In general, given coset bijections 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the composition of partial bijections 
 
 
 
  could be empty. If it is not, then a unique coset bijection 
 
 
 
  exists such that 
 
 
 
 . (Again, 
 
 
 
  is a bijection between a pair of cosets in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .) This inclusion can be strict. It is always an equality (given 
 
 
 
 ) on a given skew lattice S precisely when S is categorical. In this case, by including the identity maps on each rectangular D-class and adjoining empty bijections between properly comparable D-classes, one has a category of rectangular algebras and coset bijections between them. The simple examples in Section 3 are categorical.
