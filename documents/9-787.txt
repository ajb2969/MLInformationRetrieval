   Skew lattice      Skew lattice   In abstract algebra , a skew lattice is an algebraic structure that is a non-commutative generalization of a lattice . While the term skew lattice can be used to refer to any non-commutative generalization of a lattice, over the past twenty years it has been used primarily as follows.  Definition  A skew lattice is a set  S equipped with two associative , idempotent  binary operations    ∧     \wedge   and   ∨     \vee   , called meet and join , that satisfy the following dual pair of absorption laws        x  ∧   (   x  ∨  y   )    =  x  =    (   y  ∨  x   )   ∧  x           x    x  y    x           y  x   x      x\wedge(x\vee y)=x=(y\vee x)\wedge x   and     x  ∨   (   x  ∧  y   )    =  x  =    (   y  ∧  x   )   ∨  x           x    x  y    x           y  x   x      x\vee(x\wedge y)=x=(y\wedge x)\vee x   .   Given that   ∨     \vee   and   ∧     \wedge   are associative and idempotent, these identities are equivalent to the dualities:        x  ∨  y   =  x        x  y   x    x\vee y=x   iff     x  ∧  y   =  y        x  y   y    x\wedge y=y   and     x  ∧  y   =  x        x  y   x    x\wedge y=x   iff     x  ∨  y   =  y        x  y   y    x\vee y=y   . 1   Historical background  For over 60 years, noncommutative variations of lattices have been studied with differing motivations. For some the motivation has been an interest in the conceptual boundaries of lattice theory ; for others it was a search for noncommutative forms of logic and Boolean algebra ; and for others it has been the behavior of idempotents in rings . A noncommutative lattice , generally speaking, is an algebra     (  S  ;  ∧  ,  ∨  )     S      (S;\wedge,\vee)   where   ∧     \wedge   and   ∨     \vee   are associative , idempotent  binary  operations connected by absorption identities guaranteeing that   ∧     \wedge   in some way dualizes   ∨     \vee   . The precise identities chosen depends upon the underlying motivation, with differing choices producing distinct varieties of algebras . Pascual Jordan , motivated by questions in quantum logic , initiated a study of noncommutative lattices in his 1949 paper, Über Nichtkommutative Verbande , 2 choosing the absorption identities         x  ∧   (   y  ∨  x   )    =  x  =    (   x  ∧  y   )   ∨  x    .          x    y  x    x           x  y   x      x\wedge(y\vee x)=x=(x\wedge y)\vee x.      He referred to those algebras satisfying them as Schrägverbände . By varying or augmenting these identities, Jordan and others obtained a number of varieties of noncommutative lattices. Beginning with Jonathan Leech's 1989 paper, Skew lattices in rings , 3 skew lattices as defined above have been the primary objects of study. This was aided by previous results about bands . This was especially the case for many of the basic properties.  Basic properties  Natural partial order and natural quasiorder  In a skew lattice   S   S   S   , the natural partial order is deﬁned by    y  ≤  x      y  x    y\leq x   if     x  ∧  y   =  y  =   y  ∧  x           x  y   y         y  x      x\wedge y=y=y\wedge x   , or dually,     x  ∨  y   =  x  =   y  ∨  x           x  y   x         y  x      x\vee y=x=y\vee x   . The natural preorder on   S   S   S   is given by    y  ⪯  x     precedes-or-equals  y  x    y\preceq x   if     y  ∧  x  ∧  y   =  y        y  x  y   y    y\wedge x\wedge y=y   or dually     x  ∨  y  ∨  x   =  x        x  y  x   x    x\vee y\vee x=x   . While   ≤     \leq   and   ⪯   precedes-or-equals   \preceq   agree on lattices,   ≤     \leq   properly reﬁnes   ⪯   precedes-or-equals   \preceq   in the noncommutative case. The induced natural equivalence    D   D   D   is deﬁned by    x  D  y      x  D  y    xDy   if    x  ⪯  y  ⪯  x       precedes-or-equals  x  y    precedes-or-equals    x     x\preceq y\preceq x   , that is,     x  ∧  y  ∧  x   =  x        x  y  x   x    x\wedge y\wedge x=x   and     y  ∧  x  ∧  y   =  y        y  x  y   y    y\wedge x\wedge y=y   or dually,     x  ∨  y  ∨  x   =  x        x  y  x   x    x\vee y\vee x=x   and     y  ∨  x  ∨  y   =  y        y  x  y   y    y\vee x\vee y=y   . The blocks of the partition    S  /  D      S  D    S/D   are lattice ordered by    A  >  B      A  B    A>B   iﬀ    a  ∈  A      a  A    a\in A   and    b  ∈  B      b  B    b\in B   exist such that    a  >  b      a  b    a>b   . This permits us to write Hasse diagrams of skew lattices such as the following pair:   (Figure)  Skew diag.png    E.g., in the diagram on the left above, that   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   are   D   D   D   related is expressed by the dashed segment. The slanted lines reveal the natural partial order between elements of the distinct   D   D   D   -classes. The elements   1   1   1   ,   c   c   c   and   0   0    form the singleton   D   D   D   -classes.  Rectangular Skew Lattices  Skew lattices consisting of a single   D   D   D   -class are called rectangular . They are characterized by the equivalent identities     x  ∧  y  ∧  x   =  x        x  y  x   x    x\wedge y\wedge x=x   ,     y  ∨  x  ∨  y   =  y        y  x  y   y    y\vee x\vee y=y   and     x  ∨  y   =   y  ∧  x         x  y     y  x     x\vee y=y\wedge x   . Rectangular skew lattices are isomorphic to skew lattices having the following construction (and conversely): given nonempty sets   L   L   L   and   R   R   R   , on    L  ×  R      L  R    L\times R   deﬁne      (  x  ,  y  )   ∨   (  z  ,  w  )    =   (  z  ,  y  )          x  y    z  w     z  y     (x,y)\vee(z,w)=(z,y)   and      (  x  ,  y  )   ∧   (  z  ,  w  )    =   (  x  ,  w  )          x  y    z  w     x  w     (x,y)\wedge(z,w)=(x,w)   . The   D   D   D   -class partition of a skew lattice   S   S   S   , as indicated in the above diagrams, is the unique partition of   S   S   S   into its maximal rectangular subalgebras, Moreover,   D   D   D   is a congruence with the induced quotient algebra    S  /  D      S  D    S/D   being the maximal lattice image of   S   S   S   , thus making every skew lattice   S   S   S   a lattice of rectangular subalgebras. This is the Cliﬀord-McLean Theorem for skew lattices, ﬁrst given for bands separately by Cliﬀord and McLean. It is also known as the First Decomposition Theorem for skew lattices .  Right (left) handed skew lattices and the Kimura factorization  A skew lattice is right-handed if it satisﬁes the identity     x  ∧  y  ∧  x   =   y  ∧  x         x  y  x     y  x     x\wedge y\wedge x=y\wedge x   or dually,     x  ∨  y  ∨  x   =   x  ∨  y         x  y  x     x  y     x\vee y\vee x=x\vee y   . These identities essentially assert that     x  ∧  y   =  y        x  y   y    x\wedge y=y   and     x  ∨  y   =  x        x  y   x    x\vee y=x   in each   D   D   D   -class. Every skew lattice   S   S   S   has a unique maximal right-handed image    S  /  L      S  L    S/L   where the congruence   L   L   L   is deﬁned by    x  L  y      x  L  y    xLy   if both     x  ∧  y   =  x        x  y   x    x\wedge y=x   and     y  ∧  x   =  y        y  x   y    y\wedge x=y   (or dually,     x  ∨  y   =  y        x  y   y    x\vee y=y   and     y  ∨  x   =  x        y  x   x    y\vee x=x   ). Likewise a skew lattice is left-handed if     x  ∧  y   =  x        x  y   x    x\wedge y=x   and     x  ∨  y   =  y        x  y   y    x\vee y=y   in each   D   D   D   -class. Again the maximal left-handed image of a skew lattice   S   S   S   is the image    S  /  R      S  R    S/R   where the congruence   R   R   R   is deﬁned in dual fashion to   L   L   L   . Many examples of skew lattices are either right or left-handed. In the lattice of congruences,     R  ∨  L   =  D        R  L   D    R\vee L=D   and    R  ∩  L      R  L    R\cap L   is the identity congruence   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   . The induced epimorphism    S  →   S  /  D      normal-→  S    S  D     S\rightarrow S/D   factors through both induced epimorphisms    S  →   S  /  L      normal-→  S    S  L     S\rightarrow S/L   and    S  →   S  /  R      normal-→  S    S  R     S\rightarrow S/R   . Setting    T  =   S  /  D       T    S  D     T=S/D   , the homomorphism    k  :   S  →     S  /  L   ×  S   /  R       normal-:  k   normal-→  S        S  L   S   R      k:S\rightarrow S/L\times S/R   deﬁned by     k   (  x  )    =   (   L  x   ,   R  x   )         k  x     subscript  L  x    subscript  R  x      k(x)=(L_{x},R_{x})   , induces an isomorphism    k  *  :  S  ∼  S  /  L   ×  T   S  /  R     fragments  k   normal-:  S  similar-to  S   L   subscript   T   S   R    k*:S\sim S/L\times_{T}S/R   . This is the Kimura factorization of   S   S   S   into a ﬁbred product of its maximal right and left-handed images.   (Figure)  Skew pullback.png    Like the Cliﬀord-McLean Theorem, Kimura factorization (or the Second Decomposition Theorem for skew lattices ) was ﬁrst given for regular bands (that satisfy the middle absorption identity,     x  y  x  z  x   =   x  y  z  x         x  y  x  z  x     x  y  z  x     xyxzx=xyzx   ). Indeed both   ∧     \wedge   and   ∨     \vee   are regular band operations. The above symbols   D   D   D   ,   R   R   R   and   L   L   L   come, of course, from basic semigroup theory.  For more details on the basic properties of a skew lattice please read 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and. 11  Subvarieties of skew lattices  Skew lattices form a variety. Rectangular skew lattices, left-handed and right-handed skew lattices all form subvarieties that are central to the basic structure theory of skew lattices. Here are several more.  Symmetric Skew Lattices  A skew lattice S is symmetric if for any     x  ,  y   ∈  S       x  y   S    x,y\in S   ,     x  ∧  y   =   y  ∧  x         x  y     y  x     x\wedge y=y\wedge x   iﬀ     x  ∨  y   =   y  ∨  x         x  y     y  x     x\vee y=y\vee x   . Occurrences of commutation are thus unambiguous for such skew lattices, with subsets of pairwise commuting elements generating commutative subalgebras, i.e, sublattices. ( This is not true for skew lattices in general.) Equational bases for this subvariety, ﬁrst given by Spinks 12 are:     x  ∨  y  ∨   (   x  ∧  y   )    =    (   y  ∧  x   )   ∨  y  ∨  x         x  y    x  y        y  x   y  x     x\vee y\vee(x\wedge y)=(y\wedge x)\vee y\vee x   and     x  ∧  y  ∧   (   x  ∨  y   )    =    (   y  ∨  x   )   ∧  y  ∧  x         x  y    x  y        y  x   y  x     x\wedge y\wedge(x\vee y)=(y\vee x)\wedge y\wedge x   . A lattice section of a skew lattice   S   S   S   is a sublattice   T   T   T   of   S   S   S   meeting each   D   D   D   -class of   S   S   S   at a single element.   T   T   T   is thus an internal copy of the lattice    S  /  D      S  D    S/D   with the composition    T  ⊂  S  →   S  /  D         T  S    normal-→      S  D      T\subset S\rightarrow S/D   being an isomorphism. All symmetric skew lattices for which |S/D| \leq \aleph_0 , admit a lattice section. 13 Symmetric or not, having a lattice section   T   T   T   guarantees that   S   S   S   also has internal copies of    S  /  L      S  L    S/L   and    S  /  R      S  R    S/R   given respectively by     T   [  R  ]    =    ⋃   t  ∈  T     R  t          T   delimited-[]  R      subscript     t  T     subscript  R  t      T[R]=\bigcup_{t\in T}R_{t}   and     T   [  L  ]    =    ⋃   t  ∈  T     L  t          T   delimited-[]  L      subscript     t  T     subscript  L  t      T[L]=\bigcup_{t\in T}L_{t}   , where    R  t     subscript  R  t    R_{t}   and    L  t      L  t    Lt   are the   R   R   R   and   L   L   L   congruence classes of   t   t   t   in   T   T   T   . Thus     T   [  R  ]    ⊂  S  →   S  /  L           T   delimited-[]  R    S    normal-→      S  L      T[R]\subset S\rightarrow S/L   and     T   [  L  ]    ⊂  S  →   S  /  R           T   delimited-[]  L    S    normal-→      S  R      T[L]\subset S\rightarrow S/R   are isomorphisms (See 14 ). This leads to a commuting diagram of embedding dualizing the preceding Kimura diagram.   (Figure)  Skew lsection.png    Cancellative Skew Lattices  A skew lattice is cancellative if     x  ∨  y   =   x  ∨  z         x  y     x  z     x\vee y=x\vee z   and     x  ∧  y   =   x  ∧  z         x  y     x  z     x\wedge y=x\wedge z   implies    y  =  z      y  z    y=z   and likewise     x  ∨  z   =   y  ∨  z         x  z     y  z     x\vee z=y\vee z   and     x  ∧  z   =   y  ∧  z         x  z     y  z     x\wedge z=y\wedge z   implies    x  =  y      x  y    x=y   . Cancellatice skew lattices are symmetric and can be shown to form a variety. Unlike lattices, they need not be distributive, and conversely.  Distributive Skew Lattices  Distributive skew lattices are determined by the identities:     x  ∧   (   y  ∨  z   )   ∧  x   =    (   x  ∧  y  ∧  x   )   ∨   (   x  ∧  z  ∧  x   )          x    y  z   x       x  y  x     x  z  x      x\wedge(y\vee z)\wedge x=(x\wedge y\wedge x)\vee(x\wedge z\wedge x)   (D1 )      x  ∨   (   y  ∧  z   )   ∨  x   =    (   x  ∨  y  ∨  x   )   ∧   (   x  ∨  z  ∨  x   )     .        x    y  z   x       x  y  x     x  z  x      x\vee(y\wedge z)\vee x=(x\vee y\vee x)\wedge(x\vee z\vee x).   (D’1 )  Unlike lattices, (D1 ) and (D‘1 ) are not equivalent in general for skew lattices, but they are for symmetric skew lattices. (See,,. 15 16 17 ) The condition (D1 ) can be strengthened to     x  ∧   (   y  ∨  z   )   ∧  w   =    (   x  ∧  y  ∧  w   )   ∨   (   x  ∧  z  ∧  w   )          x    y  z   w       x  y  w     x  z  w      x\wedge(y\vee z)\wedge w=(x\wedge y\wedge w)\vee(x\wedge z\wedge w)   (D2 ) in which case (D‘1 ) is a consequence. A skew lattice   S   S   S   satisﬁes both (D2) and its dual,     x  ∨   (   y  ∧  z   )   ∨  w   =    (   x  ∨  y  ∨  w   )   ∧   (   x  ∨  z  ∨  w   )          x    y  z   w       x  y  w     x  z  w      x\vee(y\wedge z)\vee w=(x\vee y\vee w)\wedge(x\vee z\vee w)   , if and only if it factors as the product of a distributive lattice and a rectangular skew lattice. In this latter case (D2 ) can be strengthened to     x  ∧   (   y  ∨  z   )    =    (   x  ∧  y   )   ∨   (   x  ∧  z   )          x    y  z        x  y     x  z      x\wedge(y\vee z)=(x\wedge y)\vee(x\wedge z)   and      (   y  ∨  z   )   ∧  w   =    (   y  ∧  w   )   ∨   (   z  ∧  w   )            y  z   w       y  w     z  w      (y\vee z)\wedge w=(y\wedge w)\vee(z\wedge w)   . (D3 ) On its own, (D3 ) is equivalent to (D2 ) when symmetry is added. (See. 18 ) We thus have six subvarieties of skew lattices determined respectively by (D1), (D2), (D3) and their duals.  Normal Skew Lattices  As seen above,   ∧     \wedge   and   ∨     \vee   satisfy the identity     x  y  x  z  x   =   x  y  z  x         x  y  x  z  x     x  y  z  x     xyxzx=xyzx   . Bands satisfying the stronger identity,     x  y  z  x   =   x  z  y  x         x  y  z  x     x  z  y  x     xyzx=xzyx   , are called normal. A skew lattice is normal skew if it satisﬁes        x  ∧  y  ∧  z  ∧  x   =   x  ∧  z  ∧  y  ∧  x    .   (  N  )      formulae-sequence      x  y  z  x     x  z  y  x    N    x\wedge y\wedge z\wedge x=x\wedge z\wedge y\wedge x.(N)     For each element a in a normal skew lattice   S   S   S   , the set    a  ∧  S  ∧  a      a  S  a    a\wedge S\wedge a   deﬁned by {    a  ∧  x  ∧  a  |  x  ∈  S     fragments  a   x   a  normal-|  x   S    a\wedge x\wedge a|x\in S   } or equivalently {    x  ∈  S  |  x  ≤  a     fragments  x   S  normal-|  x   a    x\in S|x\leq a   } is a sublattice of   S   S   S   , and conversely. (Thus normal skew lattices have also been called local lattices.) When both   ∧     \wedge   and   ∨     \vee   are normal,   S   S   S   splits isomorphically into a product    T  ×  D      T  D    T\times D   of a lattice   T   T   T   and a rectangular skew lattice   D   D   D   , and conversely. Thus both normal skew lattices and split skew lattices form varieties. Returning to distribution,     (   D  2   )   =    (   D  1   )   +   (  N  )          D  2       D  1   N     (D2)=(D1)+(N)   so that    (   D  2   )      D  2    (D2)   characterizes the variety of distributive, normal skew lattices, and (D3) characterizes the variety of symmetric, distributive, normal skew lattices.  Categorical Skew Lattices  A skew lattice is categorical if nonempty composites of coset bijections are coset bijections. Categorical skew lattices form a variety. Skew lattices in rings and normal skew lattices are examples of algebras on this variety. 19 Let    a  >  b  >  c        a  b       c     a>b>c   with    a  ∈  A      a  A    a\in A   ,    b  ∈  B      b  B    b\in B   and    c  ∈  C      c  C    c\in C   ,   φ   φ   \varphi   be the coset bijection from   A   A   A   to   B   B   B   taking   a   a   a   to   b   b   b   ,   ψ   ψ   \psi   be the coset bijection from   B   B   B   to   C   C   C   taking   b   b   b   to   c   c   c   and ﬁnally   χ   χ   \chi   be the coset bijection from   A   A   A   to   C   C   C   taking   a   a   a   to   c   c   c   . A skew lattice   S   S   S   is categorical if one always has the equality     ψ  ∘  φ   =  χ        ψ  φ   χ    \psi\circ\varphi=\chi   , ie. , if the composite partial bijection    ψ  ∘  φ      ψ  φ    \psi\circ\varphi   if nonempty is a coset bijection from a   C   C   C   -coset of   A   A   A   to an   A   A   A   -coset of   C   C   C   . That is      (   A  ∧  b  ∧  A   )   ∩   (   C  ∨  b  ∨  C   )    =    (   C  ∨  a  ∨  C   )   ∧  b  ∧   (   C  ∨  a  ∨  C   )    =    (   A  ∧  c  ∧  A   )   ∨  b  ∨   (   A  ∧  c  ∧  A   )              A  b  A     C  b  C        C  a  C   b    C  a  C             A  c  A   b    A  c  A       (A\wedge b\wedge A)\cap(C\vee b\vee C)=(C\vee a\vee C)\wedge b\wedge(C\vee a%
 \vee C)=(A\wedge c\wedge A)\vee b\vee(A\wedge c\wedge A)   . All distributive skew lattices are categorical. Though symmetric skew lattices might not be. In a sense they reveal the independence between the properties of symmetry and distributivity.

(0)  A Boolean skew lattice is a symmetric, distributive normal skew lattice with 0,    (  S  ;  ∨  ,  ∧  ,  0  )     S    0    (S;\vee,\wedge,0)   , such that    a  ∧  S  ∧  a      a  S  a    a\wedge S\wedge a   is a Boolean lattice for each    a  ∈  S      a  S    a\in S   . Given such skew lattice S , a diﬀerence operator \ is deﬁned on 28 by x\ y =     x  -  x   ∧  y  ∧  x        x  x   y  x    x-x\wedge y\wedge x   where the latter is evaluated in the Boolean lattice    x  ∧  S  ∧  x      x  S  x    x\wedge S\wedge x   . In the presence of (D3) and (0), \ is characterized by the identities:     y  ∧   x  /  y    =  0  =    x  /  y   ∧  y           y    x  y    0           x  y   y      y\wedge x/y=0=x/y\wedge y   and       (   x  ∧  y  ∧  x   )   ∨   x  /  y    =  x  =    x  /  y   ∨   (   x  ∧  y  ∧  x   )     .   (   S  B   )      formulae-sequence          x  y  x     x  y    x           x  y     x  y  x        S  B     (x\wedge y\wedge x)\vee x/y=x=x/y\vee(x\wedge y\wedge x).(SB)   One thus has a variety of skew Boolean algebras    (  S  ;  ∨  ,  ∧  ,  /  ,  0  )     S     0    (S;\vee,\wedge,/,0)   characterized by identities (D3), (0) and (S B). A primitive skew Boolean algebra consists of 0 and a single non-0 D-class. Thus it is the result of adjoining a 0 to a rectangular skew lattice D via (0) with     x  /  y   =  x        x  y   x    x/y=x   , if    y  =  0      y  0    y=0   and   0   0    otherwise. Every skew Boolean algebra is a subdirect product of primitive algebras. Skew Boolean algebras play an important role in the study of discriminator varieties and other generalizations in universal algebra of Boolean behavior. For more details on skew Boolean algebras see 29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38 . 39  Skew lattices in rings  Let   A   A   A   be a ring and let    E   (  A  )       E  A    E(A)   denote the set of all Idempotents in   A   A   A   . For all     x  ,  y   ∈  A       x  y   A    x,y\in A   set     x  ∧  y   =   x  y         x  y     x  y     x\wedge y=xy   and     x  ∨  y   =    x  +  y   -   x  y          x  y       x  y     x  y      x\vee y=x+y-xy   .  Clearly   ∧     \wedge   but also   ∨     \vee   is associative . If a subset    S  ⊆   E   (  A  )        S    E  A     S\subseteq E(A)   is closed under   ∧     \wedge   and   ∨     \vee   , then    (  S  ,  ∧  ,  ∨  )     S      (S,\wedge,\vee)   is a distributive, cancellative skew lattice. To ﬁnd such skew lattices in    E   (  A  )       E  A    E(A)   one looks at bands in    E   (  A  )       E  A    E(A)   , especially the ones that are maximal with respect to some constraint. In fact, every multiplicative band in    (  )      ()   that is maximal with respect to being right regular (= ) is also closed under   ∨     \vee   and so forms a right-handed skew lattice. In general, every right regular band in    E   (  A  )       E  A    E(A)   generates a right-handed skew lattice in    E   (  A  )       E  A    E(A)   . Dual remarks also hold for left regular bands (bands satisfying the identity     x  y  x   =   x  y         x  y  x     x  y     xyx=xy   ) in    E   (  A  )       E  A    E(A)   . Maximal regular bands need not to be closed under   ∨     \vee   as deﬁned; counterexamples are easily found using multiplicative rectangular bands. These cases are closed, however, under the cubic variant of   ∨     \vee   deﬁned by     x   ∇  y    =    x  +  y  +   y  x    -   x  y  x   -   y  x  y          x   normal-∇  y        x  y    y  x      x  y  x     y  x  y      x\nabla y=x+y+yx-xyx-yxy   since in these cases    x   ∇  y       x   normal-∇  y     x\nabla y   reduces to    y  x      y  x    yx   to give the dual rectangular band. By replacing the condition of regularity by normality    (    x  y  z  w   =   x  z  y  w    )        x  y  z  w     x  z  y  w     (xyzw=xzyw)   , every maximal normal multiplicative band   S   S   S   in    E   (  A  )       E  A    E(A)   is also closed under   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   with    (  S  ;  ∧  ,  ∨  ,  /  ,  0  )     S     0    (S;\wedge,\vee,/,0)   , where     x  /  y   =   x  -   x  y  x          x  y     x    x  y  x      x/y=x-xyx   , forms a Boolean skew lattice. When    E   (  A  )       E  A    E(A)   itself is closed under multiplication, then it is a normal band and thus forms a Boolean skew lattice. In fact, any skew Boolean algebra can be embedded into such an algebra. (See. 40 ) When A has a multiplicative identity   1   1   1   , the condition that    E   (  A  )       E  A    E(A)   is multiplicatively closed is well-known to imply that    E   (  A  )       E  A    E(A)   forms a Boolean algebra. Skew lattices in rings continue to be a good source of examples and motivation.

Given such a skew lattice   S   S   S   with   D   D   D   -classes    A  >  B      A  B    A>B   in    S  /  D      S  D    S/D   , then for any    a  ∈  A      a  A    a\in A   and    b  ∈  B      b  B    b\in B   , the subsets       A  ∧  b  ∧  A   =         A  b  A   absent    A\wedge b\wedge A=   {     u  ∧  b  ∧  u   :   u  ∈  A      normal-:    u  b  u     u  A     u\wedge b\wedge u:u\in A   }     ⊆  B      absent  B    \subseteq B   and     B  ∨  a  ∨  B   =         B  a  B   absent    B\vee a\vee B=   {     v  ∨  a  ∨  v   :   v  ∈  B      normal-:    v  a  v     v  B     v\vee a\vee v:v\in B   }     ⊆  A      absent  A    \subseteq A     are called, respectively, cosets of A in B and cosets of B in A . These cosets partition B and A with     b  i  n  A   ∧  b  ∧  A        b  i  n  A   b  A    binA\wedge b\wedge A   and    a  ∈   B  ∧  a  ∧  B       a    B  a  B     a\in B\wedge a\wedge B   . Cosets are always rectangular subalgebras in their   D   D   D   -classes. What is more, the partial order   ≥     \geq   induces a coset bijection    φ  :    B  ∨  a  ∨  B   →   A  ∧  b  ∧  A       normal-:  φ   normal-→    B  a  B     A  b  A      \varphi:B\vee a\vee B\rightarrow A\wedge b\wedge A   defined by:       ϕ   (  x  )    =  y        ϕ  x   y    \phi(x)=y   iff    x  >  y      x  y    x>y   , for    x  ∈   B  ∨  a  ∨  B       x    B  a  B     x\in B\vee a\vee B   and    y  ∈   A  ∧  b  ∧  A       y    A  b  A     y\in A\wedge b\wedge A   .  Collectively, coset bijections describe   ≥     \geq   between the subsets   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   . They also determine   ∨     \vee   and   ∧     \wedge   for pairs of elements from distinct   D   D   D   -classes. Indeed, given    a  ∈  A      a  A    a\in A   and    b  ∈  B      b  B    b\in B   , let   φ   φ   \varphi   be the cost bijection between the cosets    B  ∨  a  ∨  B      B  a  B    B\vee a\vee B   in   A   A   A   and    A  ∧  b  ∧  A      A  b  A    A\wedge b\wedge A   in   B   B   B   . Then:        a  ∨  b   =    a  ∨  φ   -   1   (  b  )      ,    b  ∨  a   =    φ  -   1   (  b  )     ∨  a       formulae-sequence      a  b       a  φ     1  b         b  a       φ    1  b    a      a\vee b=a\vee\varphi-1(b),b\vee a=\varphi-1(b)\vee a   and      a  ∧  b   =    φ   (  a  )    ∧  b    ,    b  ∧  a   =   b  ∧   φ   (  a  )         formulae-sequence      a  b       φ  a   b        b  a     b    φ  a       a\wedge b=\varphi(a)\wedge b,b\wedge a=b\wedge\varphi(a)   .  In general, given     a  ,  c   ∈  A       a  c   A    a,c\in A   and     b  ,  d   ∈  B       b  d   B    b,d\in B   with    a  >  b      a  b    a>b   and    c  >  d      c  d    c>d   , then    a  ,  c     a  c    a,c   belong to a common   B   B   B   - coset in   A   A   A   and    b  ,  d     b  d    b,d   belong to a common   A   A   A   -coset in   B   B   B   if and only if    a  >  b  /  /  c  >  d     fragments  a   b    c   d    a>b//c>d   . Thus each coset bijection is, in some sense, a maximal collection of mutually parallel pairs    a  >  b      a  b    a>b   .  Every primitive skew lattice   S   S   S   factors as the fibred product of its maximal left and right- handed primitive images      S  /  R    ×  2   S   /  L        subscript   2     S  R   S   L    S/R\times_{2}S/L   . Right-handed primitive skew lattices are constructed as follows. Let    A  =    ∪  i    A  i        A    subscript   i    subscript  A  i      A=\cup_{i}A_{i}   and    B  =    ∪  j    B  j        B    subscript   j    subscript  B  j      B=\cup_{j}B_{j}   be partitions of disjoint nonempty sets   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   , where all    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   and    B  j     subscript  B  j    B_{j}   share a common size. For each pair    i  ,  j     i  j    i,j   pick a fixed bijection     φ  i   ,  j      subscript  φ  i   j    \varphi_{i},j   from    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   onto    B  j     subscript  B  j    B_{j}   . On   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   separately set     x  ∧  y   =  y        x  y   y    x\wedge y=y   and     x  ∨  y   =  x        x  y   x    x\vee y=x   ; but given    a  ∈  A      a  A    a\in A   and    b  ∈  B      b  B    b\in B   , set        a  ∨  b   =  a   ,     b  ∨  a   =   a  ′    ,    a  ∧  b   =  b       formulae-sequence      a  b   a    formulae-sequence      b  a    superscript  a  normal-′        a  b   b      a\vee b=a,b\vee a=a^{\prime},a\wedge b=b   and     b  ∧  a   =   b  ′         b  a    superscript  b  normal-′     b\wedge a=b^{\prime}     where      φ   i  ,  j     (   a  ′   )    =  b         subscript  φ   i  j     superscript  a  normal-′    b    \varphi_{i,j}(a^{\prime})=b   and      φ   i  ,  j     (  a  )    =   b  ′          subscript  φ   i  j    a    superscript  b  normal-′     \varphi_{i,j}(a)=b^{\prime}   with    a  ′     superscript  a  normal-′    a^{\prime}   belonging to the cell    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   of   a   a   a   and    b  ′     superscript  b  normal-′    b^{\prime}   belonging to the cell    B  j     subscript  B  j    B_{j}   of   b   b   b   . The various     φ  i   ,  j       φ  i   j    \varphi i,j   are the coset bijections. This is illustrated in the following partial Hasse diagram where     |   A  i   |   =   |   B  j   |   =  2           subscript  A  i       subscript  B  j         2     |A_{i}|=|B_{j}|=2   and the arrows indicate the    φ   i  ,  j      subscript  φ   i  j     \varphi_{i,j}   -outputs and   ≥     \geq   from   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   .   (Figure)  Skew primitive.png    One constructs left-handed primitive skew lattices in dual fashion. All right [left] handed primitive skew lattices can be constructed in this fashion. (See 46 Section 1.)  The coset structure of skew lattices  A nonrectangular skew lattice   S   S   S   is covered by its maximal primitive skew lattices: given comparable   D   D   D   -classes    A  >  B      A  B    A>B   in    S  /  D      S  D    S/D   ,    A  ∪  B      A  B    A\cup B   forms a maximal primitive subalgebra of   S   S   S   and every   D   D   D   -class in   S   S   S   lies in such a subalgebra. The coset structures on these primitive subalgebras combine to determine the outcomes    x  ∨  y      x  y    x\vee y   and    x  ∧  y      x  y    x\wedge y   at least when   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   are comparable under   ⪯   precedes-or-equals   \preceq   . It turns out that    x  ∨  y      x  y    x\vee y   and    x  ∧  y      x  y    x\wedge y   are determined in general by cosets and their bijections, although in a slightly less direct manner than the   ⪯   precedes-or-equals   \preceq   -comparable case. In particular, given two incomparable D-classes A and B with join D-class J and meet D-class   M   M   M   in    S  /  D      S  D    S/D   , interesting connections arise between the two coset decompositions of J (or M) with respect to A and B. (See 47 Section 3.)   (Figure)  Skew diamond.png    Thus a skew lattice may be viewed as a coset atlas of rectangular skew lattices placed on the vertices of a lattice and coset bijections between them, the latter seen as partial isomorphisms between the rectangular algebras with each coset bijection determining a corresponding pair of cosets. This perspective gives, in essence, the Hasse diagram of the skew lattice, which is easily drawn in cases of relatively small order. (See the diagrams in Section 3 above.) Given a chain of D-classes    A  >  B  >  C        A  B       C     A>B>C   in    S  /  D      S  D    S/D   , one has three sets of coset bijections: from A to B, from B to C and from A to C. In general, given coset bijections    φ  :   A  →  B      normal-:  φ   normal-→  A  B     \varphi:A\rightarrow B   and    ψ  :   B  →  C      normal-:  ψ   normal-→  B  C     \psi:B\rightarrow C   , the composition of partial bijections    ψ  φ      ψ  φ    \psi\varphi   could be empty. If it is not, then a unique coset bijection    χ  :   A  →  C      normal-:  χ   normal-→  A  C     \chi:A\rightarrow C   exists such that     ψ  φ   ⊆  χ        ψ  φ   χ    \psi\varphi\subseteq\chi   . (Again,   χ   χ   \chi   is a bijection between a pair of cosets in   A   A   A   and   C   C   C   .) This inclusion can be strict. It is always an equality (given     ψ  φ   ≠         ψ  φ   absent    \psi\varphi\neq   ) on a given skew lattice S precisely when S is categorical. In this case, by including the identity maps on each rectangular D-class and adjoining empty bijections between properly comparable D-classes, one has a category of rectangular algebras and coset bijections between them. The simple examples in Section 3 are categorical.
