Trans-hexaprenyltranstransferase




Trans-hexaprenyltranstransferase

In enzymology, a trans-hexaprenyltranstransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

all-trans-hexaprenyl diphosphate + isopentenyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + all-trans-heptaprenyl diphosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are all-trans-hexaprenyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate, whereas its two products are diphosphate and all-trans-heptaprenyl diphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is all-trans-hexaprenyl-diphosphate:isopentenyl-diphosphate hexaprenyltranstransferase. Other names in common use include all-trans-heptaprenyl-diphosphate synthase, heptaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase, heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase, and heptaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase. This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of steroids.
