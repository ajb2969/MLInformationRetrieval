   Abhyankar–Moh theorem      Abhyankar–Moh theorem   In mathematics , the Abhyankar–Moh theorem states that if   L   L   L   is a complex line in the complex affine plane     ℂ  2     superscript  ℂ  2    \mathbb{C}^{2}   , then every embedding of   L   L   L   into    ℂ  2     superscript  ℂ  2    \mathbb{C}^{2}   extends to an automorphism of the plane. It is named after Shreeram Shankar Abhyankar and T.-T. Moh, who published it in 1975. More generally, the same theorem applies to lines and planes over any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and to certain well-behaved subsets of higher-dimensional complex affine spaces.
