Abhyankar–Moh theorem

In mathematics, the Abhyankar–Moh theorem states that if 
 
 
 
  is a complex line in the complex affine plane

 
 , then every embedding of 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
  extends to an automorphism of the plane. It is named after Shreeram Shankar Abhyankar and T.-T. Moh, who published it in 1975. More generally, the same theorem applies to lines and planes over any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and to certain well-behaved subsets of higher-dimensional complex affine spaces.
