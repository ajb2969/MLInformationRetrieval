   6-hydroxymellein O-methyltransferase      6-hydroxymellein O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a 6-hydroxymellein O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 6-hydroxymellein   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 6-methoxymellein   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 6-hydroxymellein , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and 6-methoxymellein .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:6-hydroxymellein 6-O-methyltransferase . This enzyme is also called 6-hydroxymellein methyltransferase .
