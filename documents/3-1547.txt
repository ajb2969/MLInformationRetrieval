Borel regular measure

In mathematics, an outer measure μ on n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn is called a Borel regular measure if the following two conditions hold:

Every Borel set B ⊆ Rn is μ-measurable in the sense of Carathéodory's criterion: for every A ⊆ Rn,










For every set A ⊆ Rn (which need not be μ-measurable) there exists a Borel set B ⊆ Rn such that A ⊆ B and μ(A) = μ(B).

An outer measure satisfying only the first of these two requirements is called a Borel measure, while an outer measure satisfying only the second requirement is called a regular measure.
The Lebesgue outer measure on Rn is an example of a Borel regular measure.
It can be proved that a Borel regular measure, although introduced here as an outer measure (only countably subadditive), becomes a full measure (countably additive) if restricted to the Borel sets.
