   Borel regular measure      Borel regular measure   In mathematics , an outer measure  μ on n - dimensional  Euclidean space  R n is called a Borel regular measure if the following two conditions hold:   Every Borel set  B ⊆ R n is μ -measurable in the sense of Carathéodory's criterion : for every A ⊆ R n ,           μ   (  A  )    =    μ   (   A  ∩  B   )    +   μ   (   A  ∖  B   )      .        μ  A       μ    A  B      μ    A  B       \mu(A)=\mu(A\cap B)+\mu(A\setminus B).         For every set A ⊆ R n (which need not be μ -measurable) there exists a Borel set B ⊆ R n such that A ⊆ B and μ ( A ) = μ ( B ).   An outer measure satisfying only the first of these two requirements is called a Borel measure , while an outer measure satisfying only the second requirement is called a regular measure .  The Lebesgue outer measure on R n is an example of a Borel regular measure.  It can be proved that a Borel regular measure, although introduced here as an outer measure (only countably sub additive ), becomes a full measure ( countably additive ) if restricted to the Borel sets .
