   Isoenthalpic–isobaric ensemble      Isoenthalpic–isobaric ensemble   The isoenthalpic-isobaric ensemble (constant enthalpy and constant pressure ensemble) is a statistical mechanical  ensemble that maintains constant enthalpy    H    H   H\,   and constant pressure    P    P   P\,   applied. It is also called the    N  p  H      N  p  H    NpH   -ensemble, where the number of particles    N    N   N\,   is also kept as a constant. It was developed by physicist H. C. Andersen in 1980. 1 The ensemble adds another degree of freedom , which represents the variable volume    V    V   V\,   of a system to which the coordinates of all particles are relative. The volume    V    V   V\,   becomes a dynamical variable with potential energy and kinetic energy given by    P   V       P  V    PV\,   . 2 The enthalpy    H  =   E  +   P   V         H    E    P  V      H=E+PV\,   is a conserved quantity . 3  References    "  Category:Statistical ensembles     Andersen, H.
