Isoenthalpic–isobaric ensemble

The isoenthalpic-isobaric ensemble (constant enthalpy and constant pressure ensemble) is a statistical mechanical ensemble that maintains constant enthalpy 
 
 
 
  and constant pressure 
 
 
 
  applied. It is also called the 
 
 
 
 -ensemble, where the number of particles 
 
 
 
  is also kept as a constant. It was developed by physicist H. C. Andersen in 1980.1 The ensemble adds another degree of freedom, which represents the variable volume 
 
 
 
  of a system to which the coordinates of all particles are relative. The volume 
 
 
 
  becomes a dynamical variable with potential energy and kinetic energy given by 
 
 
 
 .2 The enthalpy 
 
 
 
  is a conserved quantity.3
