   Oviaivo's polyhedra : annoviaivo      Oviaivo's polyhedra : annoviaivo   An annoviaivo is a model of polyhedron representing topological torus surfaces, it can be seen as a hollow antiprism with triangular pyramids augmented to each equatorial (vertical) faces and triangular pyramids between each themselves.  Toroidal Icosahedron  The first element of this series of polyhedra is an icosahedron which was removed an antiprism of order 3 (i.e. an octahedron ).   A star polyhedron  Annoviaivo of order "n" can be seen as a star antiprism of order "n" with a hole in the middle (i.e. without antiprism itself). Each equatorial face of the antiprism is surmounted by a tetrahedron. Each vertex of this tetrahedron is connected to the other two vertices adjacent tetrahedra. These vertices are equidistant from the vertices of the triangular base (after the antiprism). All "outside" edges are equidistant. These vertices added to those of the antiprism are placed on each side of the horizontal plane of symmetry (equatorial) of the antiprism. As a result, there are two types of vertices : :- the 2*n vertices of the antiprism that we can name " polar vertices ", each of them is the intersection of seven edges   - the 2*n vertices surrounding the equator that we can name " tropical vertices", each of them is the intersection of five edges   (Figure)  13 rings annoviaivo from order 3 to order 15|center    13 rings annoviaivo from order 3 to order 15  (You can view this in 3D-model here .)
