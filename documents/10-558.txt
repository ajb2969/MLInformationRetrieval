   Isopropanol dehydrogenase (NADP+)      Isopropanol dehydrogenase (NADP+)   In enzymology , an isopropanol dehydrogenase (NADP + ) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   propan-2-ol + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetone + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are propan-2-ol and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are acetone , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is propan-2-ol:NADP + oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called isopropanol dehydrogenase (NADP + ) . This enzyme participates in propanoate metabolism .
