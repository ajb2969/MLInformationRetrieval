Topological tensor product

In mathematics, there are usually many different ways to construct a topological tensor product of two topological vector spaces. For Hilbert spaces or nuclear spaces there is a simple well-behaved theory of tensor products (see Tensor product of Hilbert spaces), but for general Banach spaces or locally convex topological vector spaces the theory is notoriously subtle.
Tensor products of Hilbert spaces




The algebraic tensor product of two Hilbert spaces A and B has a natural positive definite sesquilinear form (scalar product) induced by the sesquilinear forms of A and B. So in particular it has a natural positive definite quadratic form, and the corresponding completion is a Hilbert space A⊗B, called the (Hilbert space) tensor product of A and B.
If the vectors ai and bj run through orthonormal bases of A and B, then the vectors ai⊗bj form an orthonormal basis of A⊗B.
Cross norms and tensor products of Banach spaces
We shall use the notation from  in this section. The obvious way to define the tensor product of two Banach spaces A and B is to copy the method for Hilbert spaces: define a norm on the algebraic tensor product, then take the completion in this norm. The problem is that there is more than one natural way to define a norm on the tensor product.
If A and B are Banach spaces the algebraic tensor product of A and B means the tensor product of A and B as vector spaces and is denoted by 
 
 
 
 . The algebraic tensor product 
 
 
 
  consists of all finite sums



where 
 
 
 
  is a natural number depending on 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
When A and B are Banach spaces, a cross norm p on the algebraic tensor product 
 
 
 
  is a norm satisfying the conditions






Here a′ and b′ are in the topological dual spaces of A and B, respectively, and p′ is the dual norm of p. The term reasonable crossnorm is also used for the definition above.
There is a largest cross norm 
 
 
 
  called the projective cross norm, given by



where 
 
 
 
 .
There is a smallest cross norm 
 
 
 
  called the injective cross norm, given by



where 
 
 
 
 . Here A′ and B′ mean the topological duals of A and B, respectively.
The completions of the algebraic tensor product in these two norms are called the projective and injective tensor products, and are denoted by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
When A and B are Hilbert spaces, the norm used for their Hilbert space tensor product is not equal to either of these norms in general. Some authors denote it by σ, so the Hilbert space tensor product in the section above would be 
 
 
 
 .
A uniform crossnorm α is an assignment to each pair 
 
 
 
  of Banach spaces of a reasonable crossnorm on 
 
 
 
  so that if 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are arbitrary Banach spaces then for all (continuous linear) operators 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the operator 
 
 
 
  is continuous and 
 
 
 
 . If A and B are two Banach spaces and α is a uniform cross norm then α defines a reasonable cross norm on the algebraic tensor product 
 
 
 
 . The normed linear space obtained by equipping 
 
 
 
  with that norm is denoted by 
 
 
 
 . The completion of 
 
 
 
 , which is a Banach space, is denoted by 
 
 
 
 . The value of the norm given by α on 
 
 
 
  and on the completed tensor product 
 
 
 
  for an element x in 
 
 
 
  (or 
 
 
 
 ) is denoted by 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 .
A uniform crossnorm 
 
 
 
  is said to be finitely generated if, for every pair 
 
 
 
  of Banach spaces and every 
 
 
 
 ,



A uniform crossnorm 
 
 
 
  is cofinitely generated if, for every pair 
 
 
 
  of Banach spaces and every 
 
 
 
 ,



A tensor norm is defined to be a finitely generated uniform crossnorm. The projective cross norm 
 
 
 
  and the injective cross norm 
 
 
 
  defined above are tensor norms and they are called the projective tensor norm and the injective tensor norm, respectively.
If A and B are arbitrary Banach spaces and α is an arbitrary uniform cross norm then



Tensor products of locally convex topological vector spaces
The topologies of locally convex topological vector spaces A and B are given by families of seminorms. For each choice of seminorm on A and on B we can define the corresponding family of cross norms on the algebraic tensor product A⊗B, and by choosing one cross norm from each family we get some cross norms on A⊗B, defining a topology. There are in general an enormous number of ways to do this. The two most important ways are to take all the projective cross norms, or all the injective cross norms. The completions of the resulting topologies on A⊗B are called the projective and injective tensor products, and denoted by A⊗γB and A⊗λB. There is a natural map from A⊗γB to A⊗λB.
If A or B is a nuclear space then the natural map from A⊗γB to A⊗λB is an isomorphism. Roughly speaking, this means that if A or B is nuclear, then there is only one sensible tensor product of A and B. This property characterizes nuclear spaces.
