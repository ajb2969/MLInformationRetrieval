Alpha recursion theory

In recursion theory, α recursion theory is a generalisation of recursion theory to subsets of admissible ordinals

 
 . An admissible ordinal is closed under 
 
 
 
  functions. Admissible ordinals are models of Kripke–Platek set theory. In what follows 
 
 
 
  is considered to be fixed.
The objects of study in 
 
 
 
  recursion are subsets of 
 
 
 
 . A is said to be 

 
  recursively enumerable if it is 
 
 
 
  definable over 
 
 
 
 . A is recursive if both A and 
 
 
 
  (its complement in 
 
 
 
 ) are 
 
 
 
  recursively enumerable.
Members of 
 
 
 
  are called 
 
 
 
  finite and play a similar role to the finite numbers in classical recursion theory.
We say R is a reduction procedure if it is 
 
 
 
  recursively enumerable and every member of R is of the form 
 
 
 
  where H, J, K are all α-finite.
A is said to be α-recusive in B if there exist 
 
 
 
  reduction procedures such that:






If A is recursive in B this is written 
 
 
 
 . By this definition A is recursive in 
 
 
 
  (the empty set) if and only if A is recursive. However A being recursive in B is not equivalent to A being 
 
 
 
 .
We say A is regular if 
 
 
 
  or in other words if every initial portion of A is α-finite.

Shore's splitting theorem: Let A be 
 
 
 
  recursively enumerable and regular. There exist 
 
 
 
  recursively enumerable 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 

Shore's density theorem: Let A, C be α-regular recursively enumerable sets such that 
 
 
 
  then there exists a regular α-recursively enumerable set B such that
