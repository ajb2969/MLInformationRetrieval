   Dirichlet algebra      Dirichlet algebra   In mathematics , a Dirichlet algebra is a particular type of algebra associated to a compact Hausdorff space X . It is a closed subalgebra of C ( X ), the uniform algebra of bounded continuous functions on X , whose real parts are dense in the algebra of bounded continuous real functions on X . The concept was introduced by .  Example  Let    ℛ   (  X  )       ℛ  X    \mathcal{R}(X)   be the set of all rational functions that are continuous on   X   X   X   ; in other words functions that have no poles in   X   X   X   . Then      𝒮  =    ℛ   (  X  )    +    ℛ   (  X  )    ¯        𝒮      ℛ  X    normal-¯    ℛ  X       \mathcal{S}=\mathcal{R}(X)+\bar{\mathcal{R}(X)}     is a *-subalgebra of    C   (  X  )       C  X    C(X)   , and of    C   (   ∂  X   )       C    X     C\left(\partial X\right)   . If   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   is dense in    C   (   ∂  X   )       C    X     C\left(\partial X\right)   , we say    ℛ   (  X  )       ℛ  X    \mathcal{R}(X)   is a Dirichlet algebra .  It can be shown that if an operator   T   T   T   has   X   X   X   as a spectral set , and    ℛ   (  X  )       ℛ  X    \mathcal{R}(X)   is a Dirichlet algebra, then   T   T   T   has a normal boundary dilation . This generalises Sz.-Nagy's dilation theorem , which can be seen as a consequence of this by letting       X  =  𝔻   .      X  𝔻    X=\mathbb{D}.
