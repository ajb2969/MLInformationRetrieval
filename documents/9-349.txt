Dirichlet algebra

In mathematics, a Dirichlet algebra is a particular type of algebra associated to a compact Hausdorff space X. It is a closed subalgebra of C(X), the uniform algebra of bounded continuous functions on X, whose real parts are dense in the algebra of bounded continuous real functions on X. The concept was introduced by .
Example
Let 
 
 
 
 
  be the set of all rational functions that are continuous on 
 
 
 
 ; in other words functions that have no poles in 
 
 
 
 . Then



is a *-subalgebra of 
 
 
 
 , and of 
 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is dense in 
 
 
 
 , we say 
 
 
 
  is a Dirichlet algebra.
It can be shown that if an operator 
 
 
 
  has 
 
 
 
 
  as a spectral set, and 
 
 
 
  is a Dirichlet algebra, then 
 
 
 
  has a normal boundary dilation. This generalises Sz.-Nagy's dilation theorem, which can be seen as a consequence of this by letting
