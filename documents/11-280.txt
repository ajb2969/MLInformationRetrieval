   Causality conditions      Causality conditions   In the study of Lorentzian manifold  spacetimes there exists a hierarchy of causality conditions which are important in proving mathematical theorems about the global structure of such manifolds. These conditions were collected during the late 1970s. 1  The weaker the causality condition on a spacetime, the more unphysical the spacetime is. Spacetimes with closed timelike curves , for example, present severe interpretational difficulties. See the grandfather paradox .  It is reasonable to believe that any physical spacetime will satisfy the strongest causality condition: global hyperbolicity . For such spacetimes the equations in general relativity can be posed as an initial value problem on a Cauchy surface .  The hierarchy  There is a hierarchy of causality conditions, each one of which is strictly stronger than the previous. This is sometimes called the causal ladder . The conditions, from weakest to strongest, are:   Non-totally vicious  Chronological  Causal  Distinguishing  Strongly causal  Stably causal  Causally continuous  Causally simple  Globally hyperbolic   Given are the definitions of these causality conditions for a Lorentzian manifold     (  M  ,  g  )     M  g    (M,g)   . Where two or more are given they are equivalent.  Notation :       p  ≪  q     much-less-than  p  q    p\ll q   denotes the chronological relation .      p  ≺  q     precedes  p  q    p\prec q   denotes the causal relation .   (See causal structure for definitions of      I   +    (  x  )        superscript  I    x    \,I^{+}(x)   ,      I   -    (  x  )        superscript  I    x    \,I^{-}(x)   and      J   +    (  x  )        superscript  J    x    \,J^{+}(x)   ,      J   -    (  x  )        superscript  J    x    \,J^{-}(x)   .)  Non-totally vicious   For some points    p  ∈  M      p  M    p\in M   we have    p  ≪̸  p     not-much-less-than  p  p    p\not\ll p   .   Chronological   There are no closed chronological (timelike) curves.  The chronological relation is irreflexive     p  ≪̸  p     not-much-less-than  p  p    p\not\ll p   for all    p  ∈  M      p  M    p\in M   .   Causal   There are no closed causal (non-spacelike) curves.  If both    p  ≺  q     precedes  p  q    p\prec q   and    q  ≺  p     precedes  q  p    q\prec p   then    p  =  q      p  q    p=q      Distinguishing  Past-distinguishing   Two points     p  ,  q   ∈  M       p  q   M    p,q\in M   which share the same chronological past are the same point:           I  -    (  p  )    =    I  -    (  q  )    ⟹  p  =  q           superscript  I    p      superscript  I    q        p       q     I^{-}(p)=I^{-}(q)\implies p=q         For any neighborhood   U   U   U   of    p  ∈  M      p  M    p\in M   there exists a neighborhood     V  ⊂  U   ,   p  ∈  V      formulae-sequence    V  U     p  V     V\subset U,p\in V   such that no past-directed non-spacelike curve from   p   p   p   intersects   V   V   V   more than once.   Future-distinguishing   Two points     p  ,  q   ∈  M       p  q   M    p,q\in M   which share the same chronological future are the same point:         I  +    (  p  )    =    I  +    (  q  )    ⟹  p  =  q           superscript  I    p      superscript  I    q        p       q     I^{+}(p)=I^{+}(q)\implies p=q      For any neighborhood   U   U   U   of    p  ∈  M      p  M    p\in M   there exists a neighborhood     V  ⊂  U   ,   p  ∈  V      formulae-sequence    V  U     p  V     V\subset U,p\in V   such that no future-directed non-spacelike curve from   p   p   p   intersects   V   V   V   more than once.   Strongly causal   For any    p  ∈  M      p  M    p\in M   there exists a neighborhood   U   U   U   of   p   p   p   such that there exists no timelike curve that passes through   U   U   U   more than once.  For any neighborhood   U   U   U   of    p  ∈  M      p  M    p\in M   there exists a neighborhood     V  ⊂  U   ,   p  ∈  V      formulae-sequence    V  U     p  V     V\subset U,p\in V   such that   V   V   V   is causally convex in   M   M   M   (and thus in   U   U   U   ).  The Alexandrov topology agrees with the manifold topology.   Stably causal  A manifold satisfying any of the weaker causality conditions defined above may fail to do so if the metric is given a small perturbation . A spacetime is stably causal if it cannot be made to contain closed causal curves by arbitrarily small perturbations of the metric. Stephen Hawking showed 2 that this is equivalent to:   There exists a global time function on   M   M   M   . This is a scalar field   t   t   t   on   M   M   M   whose gradient      ∇  a   t      superscript  normal-∇  a   t    \nabla^{a}t   is everywhere timelike and future-directed. This global time function gives us a stable way to distinguish between future and past for each point of the spacetime (and so we have no causal violations).   Globally hyperbolic       M    M   \,M   is strongly causal and every set      J  +    (  x  )    ∩    J  -    (  y  )           superscript  J    x      superscript  J    y     J^{+}(x)\cap J^{-}(y)   (for points     x  ,  y   ∈  M       x  y   M    x,y\in M   ) is compact .   Robert Geroch showed 3 that a spacetime is globally hyperbolic if and only if there exists a Cauchy surface for   M   M   M   . This means that:      M   M   M   is topologically equivalent to    ℝ  ×  S      ℝ  S    \mathbb{R}\times\!\,S   for some Cauchy surface    S   S   S   (Here   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   denotes the real line ).
