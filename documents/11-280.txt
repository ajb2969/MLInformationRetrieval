Causality conditions

In the study of Lorentzian manifold spacetimes there exists a hierarchy of causality conditions which are important in proving mathematical theorems about the global structure of such manifolds. These conditions were collected during the late 1970s.1
The weaker the causality condition on a spacetime, the more unphysical the spacetime is. Spacetimes with closed timelike curves, for example, present severe interpretational difficulties. See the grandfather paradox.
It is reasonable to believe that any physical spacetime will satisfy the strongest causality condition: global hyperbolicity. For such spacetimes the equations in general relativity can be posed as an initial value problem on a Cauchy surface.
The hierarchy
There is a hierarchy of causality conditions, each one of which is strictly stronger than the previous. This is sometimes called the causal ladder. The conditions, from weakest to strongest, are:

Non-totally vicious
Chronological
Causal
Distinguishing
Strongly causal
Stably causal
Causally continuous
Causally simple
Globally hyperbolic

Given are the definitions of these causality conditions for a Lorentzian manifold

 
 . Where two or more are given they are equivalent.
Notation:



 
  denotes the chronological relation.


 
  denotes the causal relation.

(See causal structure for definitions of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .)
Non-totally vicious

For some points 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
 .

Chronological

There are no closed chronological (timelike) curves.
The chronological relation is irreflexive

 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .

Causal

There are no closed causal (non-spacelike) curves.
If both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 


Distinguishing
Past-distinguishing

Two points 
 
 
 
  which share the same chronological past are the same point:










For any neighborhood 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  there exists a neighborhood 
 
 
 
  such that no past-directed non-spacelike curve from 
 
 
 
  intersects 
 
 
 
  more than once.

Future-distinguishing

Two points 
 
 
 
  which share the same chronological future are the same point:





For any neighborhood 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  there exists a neighborhood 
 
 
 
  such that no future-directed non-spacelike curve from 
 
 
 
  intersects 
 
 
 
  more than once.

Strongly causal

For any 
 
 
 
  there exists a neighborhood 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that there exists no timelike curve that passes through 
 
 
 
  more than once.
For any neighborhood 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  there exists a neighborhood 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is causally convex in 
 
 
 
  (and thus in 
 
 
 
 ).
The Alexandrov topology agrees with the manifold topology.

Stably causal
A manifold satisfying any of the weaker causality conditions defined above may fail to do so if the metric is given a small perturbation. A spacetime is stably causal if it cannot be made to contain closed causal curves by arbitrarily small perturbations of the metric. Stephen Hawking showed2 that this is equivalent to:

There exists a global time function on 
 
 
 
 . This is a scalar field 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  whose gradient

 
  is everywhere timelike and future-directed. This global time function gives us a stable way to distinguish between future and past for each point of the spacetime (and so we have no causal violations).

Globally hyperbolic



 
  is strongly causal and every set 
 
 
 
  (for points 
 
 
 
 ) is compact.

Robert Geroch showed3 that a spacetime is globally hyperbolic if and only if there exists a Cauchy surface for 
 
 
 
 . This means that:



 
  is topologically equivalent to 
 
 
 
  for some Cauchy surface

 
  (Here 
 
 
 
  denotes the real line).
