   3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cycloisomerase      3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cycloisomerase   In enzymology , a 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cycloisomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-carboxy-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cis,cis-butadiene-1,2,4-tricarboxylate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-carboxy-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate , and one product , cis,cis-butadiene-1,2,4-tricarboxylate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically intramolecular lyases . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-carboxy-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate lyase (decyclizing) . Other names in common use include beta-carboxymuconate lactonizing enzyme , and 3-carboxymuconolactone hydrolase . This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
