   Radical polynomial      Radical polynomial   In mathematics , in the realm of abstract algebra , a radical polynomial is a multivariate polynomial over a field that can be expressed as a polynomial in the sum of squares of the variables. That is, if      k   [   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   ]       k    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n      k[x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}]     is a polynomial ring , the ring of radical polynomials is the subring generated by the polynomial        ∑   i  =  1   n    x  i  2    .      superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript   subscript  x  i   2     \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{2}.     Radical polynomials are characterized as precisely those polynomials that are invariant under the action of the orthogonal group .  The ring of radical polynomials is a graded subalgebra of the ring of all polynomials.  The standard separation of variables theorem asserts that every polynomial can be expressed as a finite sum of terms, each term being a product of a radical polynomial and a harmonic polynomial . This is equivalent to the statement that the ring of all polynomials is a free module over the ring of radical polynomials.
