Peptide-transporting ATPase




Peptide-transporting ATPase

In enzymology, a peptide-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + H2O + peptidein 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + peptideout
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, H2O, and peptide, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and peptide.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (peptide-exporting).
