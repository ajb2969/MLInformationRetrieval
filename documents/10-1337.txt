   Aquacobalamin reductase (NADPH)      Aquacobalamin reductase (NADPH)   Aquacobalamin reductase (NADPH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 cob(II)alamin + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 aquacob(III)alamin + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cob(II)alamin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ion, whereas its 3 products are aquacob(III)alamin , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and hydrogen ion .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those oxidizing metal ion with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cob(II)alamin:NADP+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include aquacobalamin (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) , reductase , NADPH-linked aquacobalamin reductase , and NADPH2:aquacob(III)alamin oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism . It employs one cofactor , FAD .
