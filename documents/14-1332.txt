   Parametric process (optics)      Parametric process (optics)   A parametric process is an optical process in which light interacts with matter in such a way as to leave the quantum state of the material unchanged. As a direct consequence of this there can be no net transfer of energy , momentum , or angular momentum between the optical field and the physical system . In contrast a non-parametric process is a process in which any part of the quantum state of the system changes. 1  Temporal characteristics  Since a parametric process prohibits a net change in the energy state of the system, parametric processes are considered to be 'instantaneous' processes. This can be seen as follows: if an atom absorbs a photon with energy E, the atom's energy will increase by ŒîE = E. Since we are assuming this is a parametric process, the quantum state cannot change and thus this energy state must be a virtual state . By the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle we know that ŒîEŒît~ƒß/2, thus the lifetime of a parametric process is roughly Œît~ƒß/2ŒîE, which is appreciably small for any non-zero ŒîE. 2  Parametric versus non-parametric processes  Linear optics  In a linear optical system the dielectric polarization , P , responds linearly to the presence of an electric field , E , and thus we can write       ùêè  =    Œµ  0   œá  ùêÑ   =     (    n  r   +   i   n  i     )   2   ùêÑ    ,        ùêè     subscript  Œµ  0   œá  ùêÑ           superscript     subscript  n  r     i   subscript  n  i     2   ùêÑ      {\mathbf{P}}=\varepsilon_{0}\chi{\mathbf{E}}=(n_{r}+in_{i})^{2}{\mathbf{E}},   where Œµ 0 is the electric constant , œá is the ( complex ) electric susceptibility , and n r (n i ) is the real(imaginary) component of the refractive index of the medium. The effects of a parametric process will effect only n r , whereas a nonzero value of n i can only be caused by a non-parametric process.  Thus in linear optics a parametric process will act as a lossless dielectric with the following effects:   Refraction  Diffraction  Elastic scattering   Rayleigh scattering  Mie scattering    Alternatively, non-parametric processes often involve loss (or gain) and give rise to:   Absorption  Inelastic scattering   Raman scattering  Brillouin scattering   Various optical emission processes  Photoluminescence  Fluorescence  Luminescence  Phosphorescence    Nonlinear optics  In a nonlinear media , the dielectric polarization  P responds nonlinearly to the electric field  E of the light. As a parametric process is in general coherent, many parametric nonlinear processes will depend on phase matching and will usually be polarization dependent.  Sample parametric nonlinear processes:   Second harmonic generation (SHG), or frequency doubling , generation of light with a doubled frequency (half the wavelength)  Third harmonic generation (THG), generation of light with a tripled frequency (one-third the wavelength) (usually done in two steps: SHG followed by SFG of original and frequency-doubled waves)  High harmonic generation (HHG), generation of light with frequencies much greater than the original (typically 100 to 1000 times greater)  Sum frequency generation (SFG), generation of light with a frequency that is the sum of two other frequencies (SHG is a special case of this)  Difference frequency generation (DFG), generation of light with a frequency that is the difference between two other frequencies  Optical parametric amplification (OPA), amplification of a signal input in the presence of a higher-frequency pump wave, at the same time generating an idler wave (can be considered as DFG)  Optical parametric oscillation (OPO), generation of a signal and idler wave using a parametric amplifier in a resonator (with no signal input)  Optical parametric generation (OPG), like parametric oscillation but without a resonator, using a very high gain instead  Spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), the amplification of the vacuum fluctuations in the low gain regime  Optical Kerr effect , intensity dependent refractive index  Four-wave mixing (FWM)  Self-focusing  Kerr-lens modelocking (KLM)  Self-phase modulation (SPM), a    œá   (  3  )      superscript  œá  3    \chi^{(3)}   effect  Optical solitons  Cross-phase modulation (XPM)  Four-wave mixing (FWM), can also arise from other nonlinearities  Cross-polarized wave generation (XPW), a    œá   (  3  )      superscript  œá  3    \chi^{(3)}   effect in which a wave with polarization vector perpendicular to the input is generated   Sample non-parametric nonlinear processes:   Stimulated Raman scattering  Raman amplification  Two-photon absorption , simultaneous absorption of two photons, transferring the energy to a single electron  Multiphoton absorption  Multiple photoionisation , near-simultaneous removal of many bound electrons by one photon   See also   Nonlinear optics   Notes  References        "  Category:Optics  Category:Nonlinear optics  Category:Quantum optics     See Section Parametric versus Nonparametric Processes,  Nonlinear Optics by Robert W.
