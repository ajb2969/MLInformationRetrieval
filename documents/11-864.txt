   ATP citrate synthase      ATP citrate synthase   In enzymology , an ATP citrate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ADP + phosphate + acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ATP + citrate + CoA   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are ADP , phosphate , acetyl-CoA , and oxaloacetate , whereas its 3 products are ATP , citrate , and CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases that convert acyl groups into alkyl groups on transfer. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:oxaloacetate C-acetyltransferase [(pro-S)-carboxymethyl-forming, ADP-phosphorylating] . Other names in common use include ATP-citric lyase , ATP:citrate oxaloacetate-lyase [(pro-S)-CH2COO-->acetyl-CoA] , (ATP-dephosphorylating) , acetyl-CoA:oxaloacetate acetyltransferase (isomerizing , ADP-phosphorylating) , adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase , citrate cleavage enzyme , citrate-ATP lyase , citric cleavage enzyme , and ATP citrate (pro-S)-lyase . This enzyme participates in citrate cycle (tca cycle) and reductive carboxylate cycle (co2 fixation) .  References      "  Category:EC 2.3.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
