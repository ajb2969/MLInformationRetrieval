Komornik–Loreti constant

The Komornik–Loreti constant is a mathematical constant that represents the smallest number for which there still exists a unique q-development.
Definition
Given a real number q > 1, the series



is called the q-expansion, or 

 
 -expansion, of the positive real number x if, for all 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the floor function and 
 
 
 
  need not be an integer. Any real number 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  has such an expansion, as can be found using the greedy algorithm.
The special case of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  or 1 is sometimes called a 
 
 
 
 -development. 
 
 
 
  gives the only 2-development. However, for almost all 
 
 
 
 , there are an infinite number of different 
 
 
 
 -developments. Even more surprisingly though, there exist exceptional 
 
 
 
  for which there exists only a single 
 
 
 
 -development. Furthermore, there is a smallest number 
 
 
 
  known as the Komornik–Loreti constant for which there exists a unique 
 
 
 
 -development.1
The Komornik–Loreti constant is the value 
 
 
 
  such that



where 
 
 
 
  is the Thue–Morse sequence, i.e., 
 
 
 
  is the parity of the number of 1's in the binary representation of 
 
 
 
 . It has approximate value



The constant 
 
 
 
  is also the unique positive real root of



This constant is transcendental.2
