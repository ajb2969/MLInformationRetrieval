   GIT quotient      GIT quotient   In algebraic geometry, an affine GIT quotient , or affine geometric invariant theory quotient , of an affine scheme    Spec  A     Spec  A    \operatorname{Spec}A   with action by a group scheme  G is the affine scheme    Spec   (   A  G   )      Spec   superscript  A  G     \operatorname{Spec}(A^{G})   , the prime spectrum of the ring of invariants of A , and is denoted by    X  /  /  G     fragments  X    G    X/\!/G   . A GIT quotient is a categorical quotient : any invariant morphism uniquely factors through it.  Taking Proj (of a graded ring ) instead of   Spec   Spec   \operatorname{Spec}   , one obtains a projective GIT quotient (which is a quotient of the set of semistable points .)  A GIT quotient is a categorical quotient (of the semistable points); i.e., "the" quotient. Since the categorical quotient is unique, if there is a geometric quotient , then the two notions coincide: for example, one has    G  /  H  =  G  /  /  H  =  Spec  k    [  G  ]   H      fragments  G   H   G    H   Spec  k   superscript   fragments  normal-[  G  normal-]   H     G/H=G/\!/H=\operatorname{Spec}k[G]^{H}   for an algebraic group  G over a field k and closed subgroup H .  If X is a complex smooth projective variety, then the GIT quotient of X by G is homeomorphic to the symplectic quotient of X by a maximal compact subgroup of G ( Kempfâ€“Ness theorem ).
