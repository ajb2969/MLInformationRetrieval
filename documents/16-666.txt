GIT quotient

In algebraic geometry, an affine GIT quotient, or affine geometric invariant theory quotient, of an affine scheme 
 
 
 
  with action by a group scheme G is the affine scheme 
 
 
 
 , the prime spectrum of the ring of invariants of A, and is denoted by 
 
 
 
 . A GIT quotient is a categorical quotient: any invariant morphism uniquely factors through it.
Taking Proj (of a graded ring) instead of 
 
 
 
 , one obtains a projective GIT quotient (which is a quotient of the set of semistable points.)
A GIT quotient is a categorical quotient (of the semistable points); i.e., "the" quotient. Since the categorical quotient is unique, if there is a geometric quotient, then the two notions coincide: for example, one has 
 
 
 
  for an algebraic group G over a field k and closed subgroup H.
If X is a complex smooth projective variety, then the GIT quotient of X by G is homeomorphic to the symplectic quotient of X by a maximal compact subgroup of G (Kempfâ€“Ness theorem).
