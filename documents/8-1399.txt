   Semipermutable subgroup      Semipermutable subgroup   In mathematics , in algebra , in the realm of group theory , a subgroup    H   H   H   of a finite group    G   G   G   is said to be semipermutable if   H   H   H   commutes with every subgroup   K   K   K   whose order is relatively prime to that of   H   H   H   .  Clearly, every permutable subgroup of a finite group is semipermutable. The converse, however, is not necessarily true.
