Semipermutable subgroup

In mathematics, in algebra, in the realm of group theory, a subgroup

 
  of a finite group

 
  is said to be semipermutable if 
 
 
 
  commutes with every subgroup 
 
 
 
  whose order is relatively prime to that of 
 
 
 
 .
Clearly, every permutable subgroup of a finite group is semipermutable. The converse, however, is not necessarily true.
