   KR-theory      KR-theory   In mathematics, KR-theory is a variant of topological K-theory defined for spaces with an involution . It was introduced by , motivated by applications to the Atiyah–Singer index theorem for real elliptic operators.  Definition  A real space is a defined to be a topological space with an involution. A real vector bundle over a real space X is defined to be a complex vector bundle E over X that is also a real space, such that the natural maps from E to X and from C × E to E commute with the involution, where the involution acts as complex conjugation on C . (This differs from the notion of a complex vector bundle in the category of Z /2 Z spaces, where the involution acts trivially on C .)  The group KR ( X ) is the Grothendieck group of finite-dimensional real vector bundles over the real space X .  Periodicity  Similarly to Bott periodicity , the periodicity theorem for KR states that KR p , q = KR p +1, q +1 , where KR p , q is suspension with respect to R p , q = R q + i R p (with a switch in the order of p and q ), given by       K   R   p  ,  q     (  X  ,  Y  )    =   K  R   (   X  ×   B   p  ,  q     ,    X  ×   S   p  ,  q     ∪   Y  ×   B   p  ,  q      )          K   superscript  R   p  q     X  Y      K  R     X   superscript  B   p  q         X   superscript  S   p  q       Y   superscript  B   p  q          KR^{p,q}(X,Y)=KR(X\times B^{p,q},X\times S^{p,q}\cup Y\times B^{p,q})   and B p , q , S p , q are the unit ball and sphere in R p , q .
