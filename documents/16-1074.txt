Bernoulli’s Energy equation suggests such a representation. After dividing the Bernoulli equation : 1 2 by    ρ  g      ρ  g    {\rho}g   what we obtain has the units of length and the sum is known as the Head.  By dividing with the gravity acceleration    g    g   g\,   ,equation () can be rewritten as:  Where,      v    v   v\,   is the fluid flow speed at a point on a streamline,      g    g   g\,   is the acceleration due to gravity,      z    z   z\,   is the elevation of the point above a reference plane,      p    p   p\,   is the pressure at the chosen point,      ρ    ρ   \rho\,   is the density of the fluid.        v  2     2   g         superscript  v  2     2  g     \frac{v^{2}}{2\,g}\,   = Velocity head ,       p   ρ  g        p    ρ  g     \frac{p}{\rho g}\,   = Pressure head ,      z    z   z\,   = Elevation head  Hydraulic Grade Line (HGL)  Hydraulic Grade Line (HGL) 3 height is the sum of the pressure head and the elevation head above a pre-selected datum. In closed conduits flowing under pressure, the hydraulic grade line is the line to which water would rise in a vertical tube (open to atmospheric pressure) at any point along the pipe. If one were to tap a piezometer into the pipe, the liquid would rise to a height     z   +   p   ρ  g        z    p    ρ  g      \ z\,+\,\frac{p}{\rho g}   above the datum line.  Energy Grade Line (EGL)  Energy Grade Line (EGL) 4 is formed by the locus of points at a distance      v  2     2   g         superscript  v  2     2  g     \frac{v^{2}}{2\,g}\,   above the HGL, or the distance       v  2     2   g     +    p   ρ  g     +   z          superscript  v  2     2  g      p    ρ  g    z    \,\frac{v^{2}}{2\,g}\,+\,\frac{p}{\rho g}\,+\,z\,   above the datum. EGL and HGL are used by engineers who are working with pipe systems. It helps engineers to sense trouble spots in the system (usually points of low pressure).  thumb|center|upright=4|alt=HGL and EGL  Locating EGL and HGL  The following hints are useful for drawing EGL and HGL 5   By definition, the HGL is placed      v  2     2   g         superscript  v  2     2  g     \frac{v^{2}}{2\,g}\,   below the EGL. Thus if velocity of fluid is zero, as in case of a lake or a reservoir, the HGL and EGL will coincide and lie on surface of the fluid.  The head loss in a pipe or channel always means that EGL and HGL will slope downward in the direction of the flow. The greater the loss per unit length, the greater the slope.  An abrupt rise in the EGL and HGL occurs from the upstream side to the downstream side of the pump when a pump provides energy and pressure to the flow and EGL and HGL drop abruptly when a turbine is connected (Energy is abruptly taken out of the flow by turbine).  In a pipe or channel where the pressure is zero, the HGL is coincides with the system.  If a flow passage changes diameter, such as in nozzle or by means of change in pipe size, the velocity of the fluid also changes. Hence, the distance between EGL and HGL will also change. In addition, the slope on the EGL and HGL will change because the head loss per unit length will be larger in the conduit with the larger velocity.  If HGL is below the pipe, then     p   ρ  g        p    ρ  g     \frac{p}{\rho g}\,   is negative, meaning there is vacuum in the pipe, a condition that is often avoided.
