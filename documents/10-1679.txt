   N-acylglucosamine 2-epimerase      N-acylglucosamine 2-epimerase   In enzymology , a N-acylglucosamine 2-epimerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-acyl-D-glucosamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-acyl-D-mannosamine   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , N-acyl-D-glucosamine , and one product , N-acyl-D-mannosamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on carbohydrates and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-acyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase . Other names in common use include acylglucosamine 2-epimerase , and N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase . This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism . It employs one cofactor , ATP .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
