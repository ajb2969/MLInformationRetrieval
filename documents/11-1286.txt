   Hydroxymandelonitrile glucosyltransferase      Hydroxymandelonitrile glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a hydroxymandelonitrile glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + 4-hydroxymandelonitrile   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + taxiphyllin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and 4-hydroxymandelonitrile , whereas its two products are UDP and taxiphyllin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:4-hydroxymandelonitrile glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include cyanohydrin glucosyltransferase , and uridine diphosphoglucose-cyanohydrin glucosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism .
