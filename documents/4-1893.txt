   Biaxial nematic      Biaxial nematic   A biaxial nematic is a spatially homogeneous liquid crystal with three distinct optical axes. This is to be contrasted to a simple nematic , which has a single preferred axis, around which the system is rotationally symmetric. The symmetry group of a biaxial nematic is    D   2  h      subscript  D    2  h     D_{2h}   i.e. that of a rectangular right parallelepiped, having 3 orthogonal    C  2     subscript  C  2    C_{2}   axes and three orthogonal mirror planes. In a frame co-aligned with optical axes the second rank order parameter  tensor of a biaxial nematic has the form      Q  =   (       -     1  2    S    +  T     0    0      0      -     1  2    S    -  T     0      0    0    S     )       Q            1  2   S    T   0  0    0          1  2   S    T   0    0  0  S      Q=\begin{pmatrix}-\frac{1}{2}S+T&0&0\\
 0&-\frac{1}{2}S-T&0\\
 0&0&S\\
 \end{pmatrix}     where     S   S   S   is the standard nematic scalar order parameter     T   T   T   a measure of the biaxiality.  The first report of a thermotropic biaxial nematic appeared in 2004 1 2 based on a boomerang shaped oxadiazole  bent-core mesogen . The biaxial nematic phase for this particular compound only occurs at temperatures around 200 °C and is preceded by as yet unidentified smectic phases.  (Figure)  Biaxial nematic boomerang liquid crystal   It is also found that this material can segregate into chiral domains of opposite handedness. 3 For this to happen the boomerang shaped molecules adopt a helical superstructure.  In one azo bent-core mesogen a thermal transition is found from a uniaxial N u to a biaxial nematic N b mesophase, 4 as predicted by theory and simulation. 5 This transition is observed on heating from the N u phase with Polarizing optical microscopy as a change in Schlieren texture and increased light transmittance and from x-ray diffraction as the splitting of the nematic reflection. The transition is a second order transition with low energy content and therefore not observed in differential scanning calorimetry . The positional order parameter for the uniaxial nematic phase is 0.75 to 1.5 times the mesogen length and for the biaxial nematic phase 2 to 3.3 times the mesogen length.

The biaxial nematic phase is expected to be located below the minimum in the rod-disk phase diagram. In one study 6 a miscible system of rods and disks is actually found although the biaxial nematic phase remains elusive.
