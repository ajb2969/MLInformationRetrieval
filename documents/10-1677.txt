Methylitaconate Delta-isomerase




Methylitaconate Delta-isomerase

In enzymology, a methylitaconate Delta-isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

methylitaconate 
 
 
 
  2,3-dimethylmaleate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, methylitaconate, and one product, 2,3-dimethylmaleate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases transposing C=C bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is methylitaconate Delta2-Delta3-isomerase. This enzyme is also called methylitaconate isomerase. This enzyme participates in c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism.
