   Indeterminate equation      Indeterminate equation   An indeterminate equation , in mathematics , is an equation for which there is more than one solution; for example, 2 x = y is a simple indeterminate equation, as are a x + b y = c and x 2 = 1. Indeterminate equations cannot be solved uniquely. Prominent examples include the following:  Univariate  polynomial equation :          a  n    x  n    +    a   n  -  1     x   n  -  1     +  …  +    a  2    x  2    +    a  1   x   +   a  0    =  0   ,           subscript  a  n    superscript  x  n       subscript  a    n  1     superscript  x    n  1     normal-…     subscript  a  2    superscript  x  2       subscript  a  1   x    subscript  a  0    0    a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x+a_{0}=0,     which has multiple solutions for the variable x in the complex plane unless it can be rewritten in the form      a  n     (   x  -  b   )   n    =  0         subscript  a  n    superscript    x  b   n    0    a_{n}(x-b)^{n}=0   .  '''Non-degenerate conic equation :         A   x  2    +   B  x  y   +   C   y  2    +   D  x   +   E  y   +  F   =  0   ,          A   superscript  x  2      B  x  y     C   superscript  y  2      D  x     E  y   F   0    Ax^{2}+Bxy+Cy^{2}+Dx+Ey+F=0,     where at least one of the given parameters  A , B , and C is non-zero, and x and y are real variables.  Pell's equation :          x   2   -   P   y  2     =  1   ,         superscript  x  2     P   superscript  y  2     1    \ x^{2}-Py^{2}=1,     where P is a given integer that is not a square number , and in which the variables x and y are required to be integers.  The equation of Pythagorean triples :         x  2   +   y  2    =   z  2    ,         superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2     superscript  z  2     x^{2}+y^{2}=z^{2},     in which the variables x , y , and z are required to be positive integers.  The equation of the Fermat–Catalan conjecture :         a  m   +   b  n    =   c  k    ,         superscript  a  m    superscript  b  n     superscript  c  k     a^{m}+b^{n}=c^{k},     in which the variables a , b , c are required to be coprime positive integers and the variables m , n , and k are required to be positive integers the sum of whose reciprocals is less than 1.
