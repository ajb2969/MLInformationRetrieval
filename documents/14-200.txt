   Schmidt-Samoa cryptosystem      Schmidt-Samoa cryptosystem   The Schmidt-Samoa cryptosystem is an asymmetric cryptographic technique, whose security, like Rabin depends on the difficulty of integer factorization . Unlike Rabin this algorithm does not produce an ambiguity in the decryption at a cost of encryption speed.  Key generation   Choose two large distinct primes p and q and compute    N  =    p  2   q       N     superscript  p  2   q     N=p^{2}q     Compute    d  =    N   -  1    mod   lcm   (   p  -  1   ,   q  -  1   )         d   modulo   superscript  N    1      lcm     p  1     q  1        d=N^{-1}\mod\text{lcm}(p-1,q-1)      Now N is the public key and d is the private key.  Encryption  To encrypt a message m we compute the ciphertext as     c  =    m  N   mod  N    .      c   modulo   superscript  m  N   N     c=m^{N}\mod N.     Decryption  To decrypt a ciphertext c we compute the plaintext as     m  =    c  d   mod   p  q     ,      m   modulo   superscript  c  d     p  q      m=c^{d}\mod pq,   which like for Rabin and RSA can be computed with the Chinese remainder theorem .  Example:         p  =  7   ,    q  =  11   ,   N  =    p  2   q   =  539     ,   d  =    N   -  1    mod   lcm   (   p  -  1   ,   q  -  1   )     =  29      formulae-sequence   formulae-sequence    p  7    formulae-sequence    q  11       N     superscript  p  2   q        539          d   modulo   superscript  N    1      lcm     p  1     q  1           29      p=7,q=11,N=p^{2}q=539,d=N^{-1}\mod\text{lcm}(p-1,q-1)=29          m  =  32   ,   c  =    m  N   mod  N   =  373      formulae-sequence    m  32       c   modulo   superscript  m  N   N        373      m=32,c=m^{N}\mod N=373      Now to verify:       m  =    c  d   mod   p  q    =    373  29   mod   p  q    =    373  29   mod  77   =  32        m   modulo   superscript  c  d     p  q          modulo   superscript  373  29     p  q          modulo   superscript  373  29   77        32     m=c^{d}\mod pq=373^{29}\mod pq=373^{29}\mod 77=32      Security  The algorithm, like Rabin, is based on the difficulty of factoring the modulus N , which is a distinct advantage over RSA. That is, it can be shown that if there exists an algorithm that can decrypt arbitrary messages, then this algorithm can be used to factor N .  Efficiency  The algorithm processes decryption as fast as Rabin and RSA, however it has much slower encryption since the sender must compute a full exponentiation.  Since encryption uses a fixed known exponent an addition chain may be used to optimize the encryption process. The cost of producing an optimal addition chain can be amortized over the life of the public key, that is, it need only be computed once and cached.
