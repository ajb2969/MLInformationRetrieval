   Graded Lie algebra      Graded Lie algebra   In mathematics , a graded Lie algebra is a Lie algebra endowed with a gradation which is compatible with the Lie bracket . In other words, a graded Lie algebra is a Lie algebra which is also a nonassociative graded algebra under the bracket operation. A choice of Cartan decomposition endows any semisimple Lie algebra with the structure of a graded Lie algebra. Any parabolic Lie algebra is also a graded Lie algebra.  A graded Lie superalgebra 1 extends the notion of a graded Lie algebra in such a way that the Lie bracket is no longer assumed to be necessarily anticommutative . These arise in the study of derivations on graded algebras , in the deformation theory of M. Gerstenhaber , Kunihiko Kodaira , and D. C. Spencer , and in the theory of Lie derivatives .  A supergraded Lie superalgebra 2 is a further generalization of this notion to the category of superalgebras in which a graded Lie superalgebra is endowed with an additional super Z /2 Z -gradation. These arise when one forms a graded Lie superalgebra in a classical (non-supersymmetric) setting, and then tensorizes to obtain the supersymmetric analog. 3  Still greater generalizations are possible to Lie algebras over a class of braided monoidal categories equipped with a coproduct and some notion of a gradation compatible with the braiding in the category. For hints in this direction, see Lie algebra#Category theory definition .  Graded Lie algebras  In its most basic form, a graded Lie algebra is an ordinary Lie algebra   ùî§   ùî§   {\mathfrak{g}}   , together with a gradation of vector spaces:      ùî§  =    ‚äï   i  ‚àà  ‚Ñ§     ùî§  i        ùî§    subscript  direct-sum    i  ‚Ñ§     subscript  ùî§  i      {\mathfrak{g}}=\bigoplus_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}{\mathfrak{g}}_{i}   (1) such that the Lie bracket respects this gradation:        [   ùî§  i   ,   ùî§  j   ]   ‚äÜ   ùî§   i  +  j     .        subscript  ùî§  i    subscript  ùî§  j     subscript  ùî§    i  j      [{\mathfrak{g}}_{i},{\mathfrak{g}}_{j}]\subseteq{\mathfrak{g}}_{i+j}.   (2) The universal enveloping algebra of a graded Lie algebra inherits the grading.  Examples  sl(2)  For example, the Lie algebra sl(2) of trace-free 2x2 matrices is graded by the generators:        X  =   (     0    1      0    0     )    ,   Y  =   (     0    0      1    0     )     ,     formulae-sequence    X    0  1    0  0       Y    0  0    1  0       X=\left(\begin{matrix}0&1\\
 0&0\end{matrix}\right),\quad Y=\left(\begin{matrix}0&0\\
 1&0\end{matrix}\right),   and       H  =   (     1    0      0     -  1      )    .      H    1  0    0    1       H=\left(\begin{matrix}1&0\\
 0&-1\end{matrix}\right).   These satisfy the relations [ X , Y ] = H , [ H , X ] = 2 X , [ H , Y ] = -2 Y . Hence with g -1 = span( X ), g 0 = span( H ), and g 1 = span( Y ), the decomposition sl(2) = g -1 + g 0 + g 1 presents sl(2) as a graded Lie algebra.  Free Lie algebra  The free Lie algebra on a set X naturally has a grading, given by the minimum number of terms needed to generate the group element. This arises for example as the associated graded Lie algebra to the lower central series of a free group .  Generalizations  If Œì is any commutative monoid , then the notion of a Œì-graded Lie algebra generalizes that of an ordinary ( Z -) graded Lie algebra so that the defining relations (1) and (2) hold with the integers Z replaced by Œì. In particular, any semisimple Lie algebra is graded by the root spaces of its adjoint representation .  Graded Lie superalgebras  A graded Lie superalgebra over a field k (not of characteristic 2) consists of a graded vector space  E over k , along with a bilinear  bracket operation         [  -  ,  -  ]   :    E   ‚äó  k   E   ‚Üí  E      normal-:       normal-‚Üí    subscript  tensor-product  k   E  E   E     [-,-]:E\otimes_{k}E\rightarrow E        such that the following axioms are satisfied.  :*[-,-] respects the gradation of E :  :     [   E  i   ,   E  j   ]   ‚äÜ   E   i  +  j          subscript  E  i    subscript  E  j     subscript  E    i  j      [E_{i},E_{j}]\subseteq E_{i+j}   .  :*( Symmetry .) If x Œµ E i and y Œµ E j , then  :     [  x  ,  y  ]   =   -      (   -  1   )    i  j      [  y  ,  x  ]          x  y        superscript    1     i  j     y  x       [x,y]=-(-1)^{ij}\,[y,x]     :*( Jacobi identity .) If x Œµ E i , y Œµ E j , and z Œµ E k , then            (   -  1   )    i  k     [  x  ,   [  y  ,  z  ]   ]    +     (   -  1   )    i  j     [  y  ,   [  z  ,  x  ]   ]    +     (   -  1   )    j  k     [  z  ,   [  x  ,  y  ]   ]     =  0           superscript    1     i  k     x   y  z        superscript    1     i  j     y   z  x        superscript    1     j  k     z   x  y      0    (-1)^{ik}[x,[y,z]]+(-1)^{ij}[y,[z,x]]+(-1)^{jk}[z,[x,y]]=0   .  (If k has characteristic 3, then the Jacobi identity must be supplemented with the condition     [  x  ,   [  x  ,  x  ]   ]   =  0       x   x  x    0    [x,[x,x]]=0   for all x in E odd .)     Note, for instance, that when E carries the trivial gradation, a graded Lie superalgebra over k is just an ordinary Lie algebra. When the gradation of E is concentrated in even degrees, one recovers the definition of a ( Z -) graded Lie algebra.  Examples and Applications  The most basic example of a graded Lie superalgebra occurs in the study of derivations of graded algebras. If A is a graded k -algebra with gradation      A  =    ‚äï   i  ‚àà  ‚Ñ§     A  i        A    subscript  direct-sum    i  ‚Ñ§     subscript  A  i      A=\bigoplus_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}A_{i}   , then a graded k -derivation d on A of degree l is defined by   dx = 0 for x Œµ k ,  d : A i ‚Üí A i+l , and  d ( xy ) = ( dx ) y + (-1) il x ( dy ) for x Œµ A i .   The space of all graded derivations of degree l is denoted by Der l ( A ), and the direct sum of these spaces       Der   (  A  )    =    ‚äï  l     Der  l    (  A  )           Der  A     subscript  direct-sum  l      subscript  Der  l   A      \hbox{Der}(A)=\bigoplus_{l}\hbox{Der}_{l}(A)   carries the structure of an A -module. This generalizes the notion of a derivation of commutative algebras to the graded category.  On Der( A ), one can define a bracket via:   [ d ,Œ¥]= d Œ¥ - (-1) ij Œ¥ d , for d Œµ Der i ( A ) and Œ¥ Œµ Der j ( A ).   Equipped with this structure, Der( A ) inherits the structure of a graded Lie superalgebra over k .  Further examples:   The Fr√∂licher-Nijenhuis bracket is an example of a graded Lie algebra arising naturally in the study of connections in differential geometry .  The Nijenhuis-Richardson bracket arises in connection with the deformations of Lie algebras.   Generalizations  The notion of a graded Lie superalgebra can be generalized so that their grading is not just the integers. Specifically, a signed semiring consists of a pair (Œì, Œµ) where Œì is a semiring and Œµ : Œì ‚Üí Z /2 Z is a homomorphism of additive groups. Then a graded Lie supalgebra over a signed semiring consists of a vector space E graded with respect to the additive structure on Œì, and a bilinear bracket [-,-] which respects the grading on E and in addition satisfies:        [  x  ,  y  ]   =     (   -  1   )    œµ   (    deg   x   )   œµ   (    deg   y   )      [  y  ,  x  ]         x  y      superscript    1     œµ    deg  x   œµ    deg  y      y  x      [x,y]=(-1)^{\epsilon(\hbox{deg}\ x)\epsilon(\hbox{deg}\ y)}[y,x]   for all homogeneous elements  x and y , and          (   -  1   )    œµ   (    deg   x   )   œµ   (    deg   z   )      [  x  ,   [  y  ,  z  ]   ]    +     (   -  1   )    œµ   (    deg   y   )   œµ   (    deg   x   )      [  y  ,   [  z  ,  x  ]   ]    +     (   -  1   )    œµ   (    deg   z   )   œµ   (    deg   y   )      [  z  ,   [  x  ,  y  ]   ]     =  0.           superscript    1     œµ    deg  x   œµ    deg  z      x   y  z        superscript    1     œµ    deg  y   œµ    deg  x      y   z  x        superscript    1     œµ    deg  z   œµ    deg  y      z   x  y      0.    (-1)^{\epsilon(\hbox{deg}\ x)\epsilon(\hbox{deg}\ z)}[x,[y,z]]+(-1)^{\epsilon(%
 \hbox{deg}\ y)\epsilon(\hbox{deg}\ x)}[y,[z,x]]+(-1)^{\epsilon(\hbox{deg}\ z)%
 \epsilon(\hbox{deg}\ y)}[z,[x,y]]=0.      Further examples:   A Lie superalgebra is a graded Lie superalgebra over the signed semiring ( Z /2 Z ,Œµ) where Œµ is the identity endomorphism for the additive structure on the ring Z /2 Z .

This dodge is not entirely without warrant, since graded Lie superalgebras may have nothing to do with the algebras of supersymmetry . They are only super insofar as they carry a Z /2 Z gradation. This gradation occurs naturally, and not because of any underlying superspaces. Thus in the sense of category theory , they are properly regarded as ordinary non-super objects. ‚Ü©  In connection with supersymmetry , these are often called just graded Lie superalgebras , but this conflicts with the previous definition in this article. ‚Ü©  Thus supergraded Lie superalgebras carry a pair of Z /2 Z -gradations: one of which is supersymmetric, and the other is classical. Pierre Deligne calls the supersymmetric one the super gradation , and the classical one the cohomological gradation . These two gradations must be compatible, and there is often disagreement as to how they should be regarded. See Deligne's discussion of this difficulty. ‚Ü©
