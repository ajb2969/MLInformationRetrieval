   Debye frequency      Debye frequency   The Debye frequency of a crystal is a theoretical maximum frequency of vibration for the atoms that make up the crystal 1 . It was proposed by Peter Debye as part of the Debye model . It is generally not the same as the actual maximum oscillation frequency for the crystal, due to approximations in the model, however it is still a useful quantity 2 . It plays a role in the computation of the specific heat capacity of solids and in theoretical estimates of rates of diffusion . It is related to the speed of sound (v s ) in the crystal and the number density of the crystal    N  /  V      N  V    N/V   as follows 3 :       ν  m   =     (    3  N    4  π  V    )    1  /  3     v  s         subscript  ν  m      superscript      3  N     4  π  V      1  3     subscript  v  s      \nu_{m}=\left(\frac{3N}{4\pi V}\right)^{1/3}v_{s}     References   Hyperphysics  Wolfram  University of Texas   "  Category:Crystals
