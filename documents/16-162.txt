   Elliptic pseudoprime      Elliptic pseudoprime   In number theory , a pseudoprime is called an elliptic pseudoprime for ( E , P ), where E is an elliptic curve defined over the field of rational numbers with complex multiplication by an order in    ℚ   (    -  d    )       ℚ      d      \mathbb{Q}\big(\sqrt{-d}\big)   , having equation y 2 = x 3 + ax + b with a , b  integers , P being a point on E and n a natural number such that the Jacobi symbol (− d | n ) = −1, if .  The number of elliptic pseudoprimes less than X is bounded above, for large X , by       X  /   exp   (    (   1  /  3   )    log   X   log   log   log   X  /   log   log  X           )     .
