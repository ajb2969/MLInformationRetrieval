   De Gua's theorem      De Gua's theorem   __notoc__ thumb|upright=1.4|tetrahedron with a right-angle corner in O  De Gua's theorem is a three-dimensional analog of the Pythagorean theorem and named for Jean Paul de Gua de Malves .  If a tetrahedron has a right-angle corner (like the corner of a cube ), then the square of the area of the face opposite the right-angle corner is the sum of the squares of the areas of the other three faces.

 }^{2}     Generalizations  The Pythagorean theorem and de Gua's theorem are special cases ( n = 2, 3) of a general theorem about n -simplices with a right-angle corner. This, in turn, is a special case of a yet more general theorem, which can be stated as follows. 1  Let P be a k -dimensional plane in    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   (so    k  ≤  n      k  n    k\leq n   ) and let C be a compact subset of P . For any subset    I  ⊆   {  1  ,  …  ,  n  }       I   1  normal-…  n     I\subseteq\{1,\ldots,n\}   with exactly k elements, let    C  I     subscript  C  I    C_{I}   be the orthogonal projection of C onto the linear span of     e   i  1    ,  …  ,   e   i  k        subscript  e   subscript  i  1    normal-…   subscript  e   subscript  i  k      e_{i_{1}},\ldots,e_{i_{k}}   , where    I  =   {   i  1   ,  …  ,   i  k   }       I    subscript  i  1   normal-…   subscript  i  k      I=\{i_{1},\ldots,i_{k}\}   and     e  1   ,  …  ,   e  n       subscript  e  1   normal-…   subscript  e  n     e_{1},\ldots,e_{n}   is the standard basis for    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   . Then         vol  k  2    (  C  )    =    ∑  I     vol  k  2    (   C  I   )      ,         superscript   subscript  vol  k   2   C     subscript   I      superscript   subscript  vol  k   2    subscript  C  I       \mbox{vol}_{k}^{2}(C)=\sum_{I}\mbox{vol}_{k}^{2}(C_{I}),     where     vol  k    (  C  )        subscript  vol  k   C    \mbox{vol}_{k}(C)   is the k -dimensional volume of C and the sum is over all subsets    I  ⊆   {  1  ,  …  ,  n  }       I   1  normal-…  n     I\subseteq\{1,\ldots,n\}   with exactly k elements.  This theorem is essentially the inner-product-space version of Pythagoras’ theorem applied to the k th exterior power of n -dimensional Euclidean space . De Gua's theorem and its generalisation (above) to n -simplices with right-angle corners correspond to the special case where k = n −1 and C is an ( n −1)-simplex in    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   with vertices on the co-ordinate axes .  History  Jean Paul de Gua de Malves (1713–85) published the theorem in 1783, but around the same time a slightly more general version was published by another French mathematician, Charles de Tinseau d'Amondans (1746–1818), as well. However the theorem had also been known much earlier to Johann Faulhaber (1580–1635) and René Descartes (1596–1650). 2 3  Notes    References    Sergio A.
