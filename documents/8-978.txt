De Gua's theorem

__notoc__ thumb|upright=1.4|tetrahedron with a right-angle corner in O De Gua's theorem is a three-dimensional analog of the Pythagorean theorem and named for Jean Paul de Gua de Malves.
If a tetrahedron has a right-angle corner (like the corner of a cube), then the square of the area of the face opposite the right-angle corner is the sum of the squares of the areas of the other three faces.



Generalizations
The Pythagorean theorem and de Gua's theorem are special cases (n = 2, 3) of a general theorem about n-simplices with a right-angle corner. This, in turn, is a special case of a yet more general theorem, which can be stated as follows.1
Let P be a k-dimensional plane in 
 
 
 
  (so 
 
 
 
 ) and let C be a compact subset of P. For any subset 
 
 
 
  with exactly k elements, let 
 
 
 
  be the orthogonal projection of C onto the linear span of 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the standard basis for 
 
 
 
 . Then



where 
 
 
 
  is the k-dimensional volume of C and the sum is over all subsets 
 
 
 
  with exactly k elements.
This theorem is essentially the inner-product-space version of Pythagoras’ theorem applied to the kth exterior power of n-dimensional Euclidean space. De Gua's theorem and its generalisation (above) to n-simplices with right-angle corners correspond to the special case where k = n−1 and C is an (n−1)-simplex in 
 
 
 
  with vertices on the co-ordinate axes.
History
Jean Paul de Gua de Malves (1713–85) published the theorem in 1783, but around the same time a slightly more general version was published by another French mathematician, Charles de Tinseau d'Amondans (1746–1818), as well. However the theorem had also been known much earlier to Johann Faulhaber (1580–1635) and René Descartes (1596–1650).23
