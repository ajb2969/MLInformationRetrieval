   Moment of inertia factor      Moment of inertia factor   In planetary sciences , the moment of inertia factor or normalized polar moment of inertia is an important dimensionless quantity that characterizes the radial distribution of mass inside a planet or satellite .  Definition  For a planetary body with principal moments of inertia  A , as 1      C   M   R  2        C    M   superscript  R  2      \frac{C}{MR^{2}}   , where C is the polar moment of inertia of the body, M is the mass of the body, and R is the mean radius of the body. For a sphere with uniform density, C/MR 2 = 0.4. For a differentiated planet or satellite, where there is an increase of density with depth, C/MR 2 2''' |- | Body || Value || Source |- | Earth || 0.3307 || 2 |- | Mars || 0.3662 ± 0.0017 || 3 |- | Mercury || 0.346 ± 0.014 || 4 |- | Moon || 0.3929 ± 0.0009 || 5 |- | Venus || unknown || |- |}  Measurement  The polar moment of inertia is traditionally determined by combining measurements of spin quantities ( spin precession rate or obliquity ) and gravity quantities (coefficients in a spherical harmonics representation of the gravity field).  Approximation  For bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium , the Darwin-Radau relation can provide estimates of the moment of inertia factor on the basis of shape, spin, and gravity quantities. 6  Role in interior models  The moment of inertia factor provides an important constraint for models representing the interior structure of a planet or satellite. At a minimum, acceptable models of the density profile must match the volumetric mass density and moment of inertia factor of the body.
