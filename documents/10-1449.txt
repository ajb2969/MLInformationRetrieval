   Bis-gamma-glutamylcystine reductase      Bis-gamma-glutamylcystine reductase   Bis-gamma-glutamylcystine reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 gamma-glutamylcysteine + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   bis-gamma-glutamylcystine + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are gamma-glutamylcysteine and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ion, whereas its 3 products are bis-gamma-glutamylcystine , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and hydrogen ion .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is gamma-glutamylcysteine:NADP+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called NADPH2:bis-gamma-glutamylcysteine oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in glutathione metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 1.8.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
