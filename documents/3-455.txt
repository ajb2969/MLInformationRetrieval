   Trichotomy (mathematics)      Trichotomy (mathematics)   In mathematics, the Law of Trichotomy states that every real number is either positive, negative, or zero. 1 More generally, trichotomy is the property of an order relation x ,    x  =  y      x  y    x=y   , or    x  >  y      x  y    x>y   .  In mathematical notation , this is      ∀  x  ∈   X   ∀  y  ∈   X    (   (  x  <   y   ∧  ¬   (  y  <  x  )   ∧  ¬   (  x  =  y  )   )   ∨   (  ¬   (  x  <  y  )   ∧  y  <   x   ∧  ¬   (  x  =  y  )   )   ∨   (  ¬   (  x  <  y  )   ∧  ¬   (  y  <  x  )   ∧  x  =   y   )   )   .     fragments  for-all  x   X  for-all  y   X   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(  x   y     fragments  normal-(  y   x  normal-)      fragments  normal-(  x   y  normal-)   normal-)     fragments  normal-(    fragments  normal-(  x   y  normal-)    y   x     fragments  normal-(  x   y  normal-)   normal-)     fragments  normal-(    fragments  normal-(  x   y  normal-)      fragments  normal-(  y   x  normal-)    x   y  normal-)   normal-)   normal-.    \forall x\in X\,\forall y\in X\,((x     Assuming that the ordering is irreflexive and transitive , this can be simplified to      ∀  x  ∈   X   ∀  y  ∈   X    (   (  x  <  y  )   ∨   (  y  <  x  )   ∨   (  x  =  y  )   )   .     fragments  for-all  x   X  for-all  y   X   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(  x   y  normal-)     fragments  normal-(  y   x  normal-)     fragments  normal-(  x   y  normal-)   normal-)   normal-.    \forall x\in X\,\forall y\in X\,((x     In classical logic, this axiom of trichotomy holds for ordinary comparison between real numbers and therefore also for comparisons between integers and between rational numbers . The law does not hold in general in intuitionistic logic .  In ZF set theory and Bernays set theory , the law of trichotomy holds between the cardinal numbers of well-orderable sets even without the axiom of choice. If the axiom of choice holds, then trichotomy holds between arbitrary cardinal numbers (because they are all well-orderable in that case). 2  More generally, a binary relation  R on X is trichotomous if for all x and y in X exactly one of xRy , yRx or x = y holds. If such a relation is also transitive it is a strict total order ; this is a special case of a strict weak order . For example, in the case of three element set { a , b , c } the relation R given by aRb , aRc , bRc is a strict total order, while the relation R given by the cyclic aRb , bRc , cRa is a non-transitive trichotomous relation.  In the definition of an ordered integral domain or ordered field , the law of trichotomy is usually taken as more foundational than the law of total order .  A trichotomous relation cannot be reflexive , since xRx must be false. If a trichotomous relation is transitive, it is trivially antisymmetric and also asymmetric , since xRy and yRx cannot both hold.
