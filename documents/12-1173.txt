Askey–Gasper inequality

In mathematics, the Askey–Gasper inequality is an inequality for Jacobi polynomials proved by  and used in the proof of the Bieberbach conjecture.
Statement
It states that if 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  then



where



is a Jacobi polynomial.
The case when 
 
 
 
  can also be written as



In this form, with 
 
 
 
  a non-negative integer, the inequality was used by Louis de Branges in his proof of the Bieberbach conjecture.
Proof
gave a short proof of this inequality, by combining the identity



with the Clausen inequality.
Generalizations
give some generalizations of the Askey–Gasper inequality to basic hypergeometric series.
