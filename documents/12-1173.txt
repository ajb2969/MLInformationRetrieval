   Askey–Gasper inequality      Askey–Gasper inequality   In mathematics, the Askey–Gasper inequality is an inequality for Jacobi polynomials proved by  and used in the proof of the Bieberbach conjecture .  Statement  It states that if     β  ≥  0   ,   α  +   β  ≥  −  2         β  normal-≥  0     α    β  normal-≥  normal-−  2      β≥0,α+β≥−2   , and    −  1  ≤  x  ≤  1      normal-−  1  normal-≤  x  normal-≤  1    −1≤x≤1   then        ∑   k  =  0   n      P  k   (  α  ,  β  )     (  x  )      P  k   (  β  ,  α  )     (  1  )      ≥  0        superscript   subscript     k  0    n        superscript   subscript  P  k    α  β    x      superscript   subscript  P  k    β  α    1     0    \sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{P_{k}^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x)}{P_{k}^{(\beta,\alpha)}(1)}\geq 0     where       P  k   (  α  ,  β  )     (  x  )        superscript   subscript  P  k    α  β    x    P_{k}^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x)     is a Jacobi polynomial.  The case when    β  =  0      β  0    β=0   can also be written as          F  2    3     (   -  n   ,   n  +  α  +  2   ,     1  2     (   α  +  1   )    ;     1  2     (   α  +  3   )    ,   α  +  1   ;  t  )    >  0   ,   0  ≤  t  <  1    ,   α  >   -  1.       formulae-sequence   formulae-sequence       subscript   subscript  F  2   3      n     n  α  2       1  2     α  1        1  2     α  3      α  1   t    0       0  t       1       α    1.      {}_{3}F_{2}\left(-n,n+\alpha+2,\tfrac{1}{2}(\alpha+1);\tfrac{1}{2}(\alpha+3),%
 \alpha+1;t\right)>0,\qquad 0\leq t<1,\quad\alpha>-1.     In this form, with   α   α   α   a non-negative integer, the inequality was used by Louis de Branges in his proof of the Bieberbach conjecture .  Proof  gave a short proof of this inequality, by combining the identity         (   α  +  2   )   n    n  !         subscript    α  2   n     n     \displaystyle\frac{(\alpha+2)_{n}}{n!}     with the Clausen inequality .  Generalizations  give some generalizations of the Askey–Gasper inequality to basic hypergeometric series .
