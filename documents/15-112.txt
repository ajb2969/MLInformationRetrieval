Thinning (morphology)

Thinning is the transformation of a digital image into a simplified, but topologically equivalent image. It is a type of topological skeleton, but computed using mathematical morphology operators.
Example
Let 
 
 
 
 , and consider the eight composite structuring elements, composed by:


 
  and 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  and 
 
 
 
  and the three rotations of each by 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . The corresponding composite structuring elements are denoted 
 
 
 
 .
For any i between 1 and 8, and any binary image X, define




 
 ,
 



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the set-theoretical difference and 
 
 
 
  denotes the hit-or-miss transform.
The thinning of an image A is obtained by cyclically iterating until convergence:
