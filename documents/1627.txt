   Weierstrass–Enneper parameterization      Weierstrass–Enneper parameterization   In mathematics , the Weierstrass–Enneper parameterization of minimal surfaces is a classical piece of differential geometry .  Alfred Enneper and Karl Weierstrass studied minimal surfaces as far back as 1863.  Let ƒ and g be functions on either the entire complex plane or the unit disk, where g is meromorphic and ƒ is analytic , such that wherever g has a pole of order m , f has a zero of order 2 m (or equivalently, such that the product ƒ g 2 is holomorphic ), and let c 1 , c 2 , c 3 be constants. Then the surface with coordinates ( x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) is minimal, where the x k are defined using the real part of a complex integral, as follows:       x  k    (  ζ  )        subscript  x  k   ζ    \displaystyle x_{k}(\zeta)     The converse is also true: every nonplanar minimal surface defined over a simply connected domain can be given a parametrization of this type. 1  For example, Enneper's surface has ƒ( z ) = 1, g ( z ) = z .
