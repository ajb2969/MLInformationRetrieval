   Acid—CoA ligase (GDP-forming)      Acid—CoA ligase (GDP-forming)   In enzymology , an acid-CoA ligase (GDP-forming) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GTP + an acid + CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GDP + phosphate + acyl-CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are GTP , acid , and CoA , whereas its 3 products are GDP , phosphate , and acyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acid:CoA ligase (GDP-forming) . Other names in common use include acyl-CoA synthetase (GDP-forming) , and acyl coenzyme A synthetase (guanosine diphosphate forming) .
