<h1>Entanglement witness</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a href="quantum_information_theory" title="wikilink">quantum information theory</a>, an <strong>entanglement witness</strong> is a functional which distinguishes a specific <a href="Quantum_entanglement" title="wikilink">entangled state</a> from separable ones. Entanglement witnesses can be linear or nonlinear functionals of the <a href="density_matrix" title="wikilink">density matrix</a>. If linear, then they can also be viewed as <a class="uri" href="observables" title="wikilink">observables</a> for which the expectation value of the entangled state is strictly outside the range of possible expectation values of any <a href="separable_state" title="wikilink">separable state</a>.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>Let a composite quantum system have state space <span class="LaTeX">$H_A \otimes H_B$</span>. A <a href="density_matrix" title="wikilink">mixed state</a> ρ is then a <a class="uri" href="trace-class" title="wikilink">trace-class</a> positive operator on the state space which has trace 1. We can view the family of states as a subset of the real <a href="Banach_space" title="wikilink">Banach space</a> generated by the Hermitian trace-class operators, with the trace norm. A mixed state ρ is <a href="Separable_state" title="wikilink">separable</a> if it can be approximated, in the trace norm, by states of the form</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\xi = \sum_{i=1} ^k p_i \, \rho_i^A \otimes \rho_i^B,$$</span></p>
<p>where <span class="LaTeX">$\rho_i^A$</span>'s and <span class="LaTeX">$\rho_i^B$</span>'s are pure states on the subsystems <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> respectively. So the family of separable states is the closed <a href="convex_hull" title="wikilink">convex hull</a> of pure product states. We will make use of the following variant of <a href="Hahn–Banach_theorem" title="wikilink">Hahn–Banach theorem</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> Let <span class="LaTeX">$S_1$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$S_2$</span> be disjoint convex closed sets in a real Banach space and one of them is <a href="compact_space" title="wikilink">compact</a>, then there exists a bounded <a href="linear_functional" title="wikilink">functional</a> <em>f</em> separating the two sets.</p>
<p>This is a generalization of the fact that, in real Euclidean space, given a convex set and a point outside, there always exists an affine subspace separating the two. The affine subspace manifests itself as the functional <em>f</em>. In the present context, the family of separable states is a convex set in the space of trace class operators. If ρ is an entangled state (thus lying outside the convex set), then by theorem above, there is a functional <em>f</em> separating ρ from the separable states. It is this functional <em>f</em>, or its identification as an operator, that we call an <strong>entanglement witness</strong>. There are more than one hyperplane separating a closed convex set and a point lying outside of it. So for an entangled state there are more than one entanglement witnesses. Recall the fact that the dual space of the Banach space of trace-class operators is isomorphic to the set of <a href="bounded_operator" title="wikilink">bounded operators</a>. Therefore we can identify <em>f</em> with a Hermitian operator <em>A</em>. Therefore, modulo a few details, we have shown the existence of an entanglement witness given an entangled state:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> For every entangled state ρ, there exists a Hermitian operator A such that <span class="LaTeX">$\operatorname{Tr}(A \, \rho) < 0$</span>, and <span class="LaTeX">$\operatorname{Tr}(A \, \sigma) \geq 0$</span> for all separable states σ.</p>
<p>When both <span class="LaTeX">$H_A$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$H_B$</span> have finite dimension, there is no difference between trace-class and <a href="Hilbert–Schmidt_operator" title="wikilink">Hilbert–Schmidt operators</a>. So in that case <em>A</em> can be given by <a href="Riesz_representation_theorem" title="wikilink">Riesz representation theorem</a>. As an immediate corollary, we have:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> A mixed state σ is separable if and only if</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\operatorname{Tr}(A \, \sigma) \geq 0$$</span></p>
<p>for any bounded operator A satisfying <span class="LaTeX">$\operatorname{Tr}(A \cdot P \otimes Q) \geq 0$</span>, for all product pure state <span class="LaTeX">$P \otimes Q$</span>.</p>
<p>If a state is separable, clearly the desired implication from the theorem must hold. On the other hand, given an entangled state, one of its entanglement witnesses will violate the given condition.</p>
<p>Thus if a bounded functional <em>f</em> of the trace-class Banach space and <em>f</em> is positive on the product pure states, then <em>f</em>, or its identification as a Hermitian operator, is an entanglement witness. Such a <em>f</em> indicates the entanglement of some state.</p>
<p>Using the isomorphism between entanglement witnesses and non-completely positive maps, it was shown (by the Horodecki's) that</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> A mixed state <span class="LaTeX">$\sigma \in L(H_A) \otimes L(H_B)$</span> is separable if for every positive map Λ from bounded operators on <span class="LaTeX">$H_B$</span> to bounded operators on <span class="LaTeX">$H_A$</span>, the operator <span class="LaTeX">$(I_A \otimes \Lambda)(\sigma)$</span> is positive, where <span class="LaTeX">$I_A$</span> is the identity map on <span class="LaTeX">$\; L (H_A)$</span>, the bounded operators on <span class="LaTeX">$H_A$</span>.</p>
