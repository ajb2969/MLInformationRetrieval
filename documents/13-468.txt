Algorithmic version for Szemerédi regularity partition

A Simple Algorithm for Constructing Szemerédi's Regularity Partition is a paper by Alan M. Frieze and Ravi Kannan giving an algorithmic version of the Szemerédi regularity lemma to find an ε-regular partition of a given graph.
Formal statement of the regularity lemma
The formal statement of Szemerédi's regularity lemma requires some definitions. Let G be a graph. The density d(X,Y) of a pair of disjoint vertex sets X, Y is defined as d(X,Y)=|E(X,Y)|/|X||Y| where E(X,Y) denotes the set of edges having one end vertex in X and one in Y. For ε>0, a pair of vertex sets X and Y is called ε-regular, if for all subsets A⊆X and B⊆Y satisfying |A| ≥ε |X| and |B| ≥ ε |Y|, we have |d(X,Y)-d(A,B)| ≤ ε.
A partition of the vertex set of G into k sets, V1,...,Vk, is called an equitable partition if for all 
 
 
 
 , ||Vi|-|Vj||≤1. An equitable partition is an 
 
 
 
 -regular partition, if for all but at most 
 
 
 
  pairs (i,j) the pair 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 -regular.
Now we are ready to state the regularity lemma.
Regularity lemma. For every 
 
 
 
  and positive integer 
 
 
 
  there exist integers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that if 
 
 
 
  is a graph with at least 
 
 
 
  vertices, there exists an integer 
 
 
 
  in the range 
 
 
 
  ≤ 
 
 
 
  ≤ 
 
 
 
  and an 
 
 
 
 -regular partition of the vertex set of 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
  sets.
It is a common variant in the definition of an 
 
 
 
 -regular partition to require that the vertex sets all have the same size, while collecting the leftover vertices in an "error"-set 
 
 
 
  whose size is at most an 
 
 
 
 -fraction of the size of the vertex set of 
 
 
 
 .
Szemerédi's regularity lemma is one of the most powerful tools of extremal graph theory. It says that, in some sense, all graphs can be approximated by random-looking graphs. Therefore the lemma helps in proving theorems for arbitrary graphs whenever the corresponding result is easy for random graphs. The first constructive version was provided by Alon, Duke, Leffman, Rödl and Yuster.1 Subsequently Frieze and Kannan gave a different version and extended it to hypergraphs.2 The paper 3 is a nice survey on regularity lemma and its various applications. Here we will briefly describe a different construction due to Alan Frieze and Ravi Kannan that uses singular values of matrices.
Constructive version of Szemerédi regularity lemma by Frieze and Kannan
The algorithm4 is based on two crucial lemmas:
Lemma 1:
 Fix k and 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  be a graph with 
 
 
 
  vertices. Let 
 
 
 
  be an equitable partition of 
 
 
 
  in classes 
 
 
 
 . Assume 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Given proofs that more than 
 
 
 
  pairs 
 
 
 
  are not 
 
 
 
 -regular, it is possible to find in O(n) time an equitable partition 
 
 
 
  (which is a refinement of 
 
 
 
 ) into 
 
 
 
  classes, with an exceptional class of cardinality at most 
 
 
 
  and such that 
 
 
 
  ≥ 
 
 

Lemma 2:
 Let 
 
 
 
  be a 
 
 
 
 ×
 
 
 
  matrix with 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be a positive real.
 (a) If there exist 
 
 
 
  ⊆ 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  ⊆ 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 ≥
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 ≥
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ≥
 
 
 
  then 
 
 

 (b) If 
 
 
 
 , then there exist 
 
 
 
 ⊆
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 ⊆
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 ≥
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 ≥
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ≥
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 . Furthermore 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  can be constructed in polynomial time.
These two lemmas are combined in the following algorithmic construction of the Szemerédi regularity lemma.
[Step 1] Arbitrarily divide the vertices of 
 
 
 
  into an equitable partition 
 
 
 
  with classes 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and hence 
 
 
 
 .
[Step 2] For every pair 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , compute 
 
 
 
 . If the pair 
 
 
 
  are not 
 
 
 
 regular then by Lemma 2 we obtain a proof that they are not 
 
 
 
 regular.
[Step 3] If there are at most 
 
 
 
  pairs that produce proofs of non 
 
 
 
 regularity that halt. 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 regular.
[Step 4] Apply Lemma 1 where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and obtain 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  classes
[Step 5] Let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and go to Step 2.
The algorithm will terminate with an 
 
 
 
 -regular partition in 
 
 
 
  steps since the improvement at each step is $\gamma^5/20=O(\epsilon^{45})$.
