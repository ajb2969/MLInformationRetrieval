   Seesaw mechanism      Seesaw mechanism   In the theory of grand unification of particle physics , and, in particular, in theories of neutrino masses and neutrino oscillation , the seesaw mechanism is a generic model used to understand the relative sizes of observed neutrino masses, of the order of eV , compared to those of quarks and charged leptons , which are millions of times heavier.  There are several types of models, each extending the Standard Model . The simplest version, type 1, extends the Standard Model by assuming two or more additional right-handed neutrino fields inert under the electroweak interactions, 1 and the existence of a very large mass scale. This allows the mass scale to be identifiable with the postulated scale of grand unification.  Type 1 seesaw  This model produces a light neutrino, for each of the three known neutrino flavors, and a corresponding very heavy neutrino for each flavor, which has yet to be observed.  The simple mathematical principle behind the seesaw mechanism is the following property of any 2×2 matrix      A  =    (     0     M  ;       M     B  ;      )   ,       A      0  M    M  B    ,     A=\begin{pmatrix}0&M\\
 M&B\end{pmatrix}\text{,}   where B is taken to be much larger than M .  It has two very disproportioned eigenvalues :       λ  ±   =     B  ±     B  2   +   4   M  2       2   .        subscript  λ  plus-or-minus        plus-or-minus  B       superscript  B  2     4   superscript  M  2       2   .     \lambda_{\pm}=\frac{B\pm\sqrt{B^{2}+4M^{2}}}{2}\text{.}   The larger eigenvalue, λ + , is approximately equal to   B   B   B   , while the smaller eigenvalue is approximately equal to        λ  -   ≈   -    M  2   B     .       subscript  λ         superscript  M  2   B      \lambda_{-}\approx-\frac{M^{2}}{B}.   Thus, | M | is the geometric mean of λ + and , since the determinant equals − M  2 }} .  If one of the eigenvalues goes up, the other goes down, and vice versa. This is the point of the name " seesaw " of the mechanism.  This mechanism serves to explain why the neutrino masses are so small. 2 3 4 5 6 The matrix A is essentially the mass matrix for the neutrinos. The Majorana mass B component is comparable to the GUT scale and violates lepton number; while the components M , the Dirac mass, is of order of the much smaller electroweak scale , the VEV below. The smaller eigenvalue λ − then leads to a very small neutrino mass comparable to , which is in qualitative accord with experiments, sometimes regarded as supportive evidence for the framework of Grand Unified Theories.  Background  The 2×2 matrix A arises in a natural manner within the standard model by considering the most general mass matrix allowed by gauge invariance of the standard model action , and the corresponding charges of the lepton- and neutrino fields.  Let the Weyl spinor  χ be the neutrino part of a left-handed  lepton  isospin  doublet (the other part being the left-handed charged lepton),       L  =    (     χ       χ  ′      )     ,      L    χ     superscript  χ  normal-′       L=\begin{pmatrix}\chi\\
 \chi^{\prime}\end{pmatrix}~{},   as it is present in the minimal standard model without neutrino masses, and let η be a postulated right-handed neutrino Weyl spinor which is a singlet under weak isospin (i.e. does not interact weakly, such as a sterile neutrino ).  There are now three ways to form Lorentz covariant mass terms, giving either         1  2      B  ′     χ  α     χ  α    ,      1  2     B    η  α     η  α    ,   or    M    η  α     χ  α    ,          1  2    superscript  B  normal-′    superscript  χ  α    subscript  χ  α   ,       1  2   B   superscript  η  α    subscript  η  α   ,   or    M   superscript  η  α    subscript  χ  α   ,     \frac{1}{2}\,B^{\prime}\,\chi^{\alpha}\chi_{\alpha}\,\text{,}\quad\frac{1}{2}%

 \eta\end{pmatrix}.   Since the right-handed neutrino spinor is uncharged under all standard model gauge symmetries, B is a free parameter which can in principle take any arbitrary value.  The parameter M is forbidden by electroweak gauge symmetry , and can only appear after its spontaneous breakdown through a Higgs mechanism , like the Dirac masses of the charged leptons. In particular, since  has weak isospin ½ like the Higgs field  H , and η has weak isospin 0, the mass parameter M can be generated from Yukawa interactions with the Higgs field , in the conventional standard model fashion,       ℒ   y  u  k    =     y   η  L  ϵ   H  *    +  …        subscript  ℒ    y  u  k        y  η  L  ϵ   superscript  H     normal-…     \mathcal{L}_{yuk}=y\,\eta L\epsilon H^{*}+...   This means that M is naturally of the order of the vacuum expectation value of the standard model Higgs field ,        VEV  v   ≈   246  GeV    ,    |   ⟨  H  ⟩   |   =   v  /   2        formulae-sequence      VEV  v     246  GeV         delimited-⟨⟩  H      v    2       \text{VEV }v\approx 246\text{ GeV},\qquad\qquad|\langle H\rangle|=v/\sqrt{2}           M  t   =   O   (   v  /   2    )    ≈   174   GeV     ,         subscript  M  t     O    v    2            174  GeV      M_{t}=O(v/\sqrt{2})\approx 174\text{ GeV}~{},   if the dimensionless Yukawa coupling is of order . It can be chosen smaller consistently, but extreme values  can make the model nonperturbative .  The parameter B ', on the other hand, is forbidden, since no renormalizable singlet under weak hypercharge and isospin can be formed using these doublet components−−only a nonrenormalizable, dimension 5 term is allowed. This is the origin of the pattern and hierarchy of scales of the mass matrix A within the "type 1" seesaw mechanism.  The large size of B can be motivated in the context of grand unification . In such models, enlarged gauge symmetries may be present, which initially force  in the unbroken phase, but generate a non vanishing large value ≈ 10 15 GeV, around the scale of their spontaneous symmetry breaking , so, given an M ≈ 100 GeV, one has λ − ≈ 0.01 eV. A huge scale has thus induced a dramatically small neutrino mass for the eigenvector ν ≈ χ − (M/B) η .
