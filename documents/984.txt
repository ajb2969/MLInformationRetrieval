   J-invariant      J-invariant   (Figure)  Klein's   j   j   j   -invariant in the complex plane   In mathematics , Klein's  j -invariant , regarded as a function of a complex variable  τ , is a modular function of weight zero for    S  L   (  2  ,  𝐙  )       S  L   2  𝐙     SL(2,\mathbf{Z})   defined on the upper half-plane of complex numbers. It is the unique such function which is holomorphic away from a simple pole at the cusp such that        j   (   e    2  3   π  i    )    =  0   ,    j   (  i  )    =  1728.      formulae-sequence      j   superscript  e      2  3   π  i     0       j  i   1728.     j\left(e^{\frac{2}{3}\pi i}\right)=0,\quad j(i)=1728.     Rational functions of   j   j   j   are modular, and in fact give all modular functions. Classically, the   j   j   j   -invariant was studied as a parameterization of elliptic curves over   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   , but it also has surprising connections to the symmetries of the Monster group (this connection is referred to as monstrous moonshine ).  Definition    While the   j   j   j   -invariant can be defined purely in terms of certain infinite sums (see below), these can be motivated by considering isomorphism classes of elliptic curves. Every elliptic curve   E   E   E   over   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   is a complex torus, and thus can be identified with a rank 2 lattice; i.e., two-dimensional lattice of   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   . This is done by identifying opposite edges of each parallelogram in the lattice. It turns out that multiplying the lattice by complex numbers, which corresponds to rotating and scaling the lattice, preserves the isomorphism class of the elliptic curve, and thus we can consider the lattice generated by   1   1   1   and some   τ   τ   τ   in   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   (where   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   is the Upper half-plane ). Conversely, if we define      g  2     subscript  g  2    \displaystyle g_{2}     then this lattice corresponds to the elliptic curve over   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   defined by 4 x 3 − g 2 x - g 3 }} via the Weierstrass elliptic functions . Then the   j   j   j   -invariant is defined as       j   (  τ  )    =   1728    g  2  3   Δ          j  τ     1728     superscript   subscript  g  2   3   normal-Δ      j(\tau)=1728\frac{g_{2}^{3}}{\Delta}     where the modular discriminant    Δ   normal-Δ   Δ   is      Δ  =    g  2  3   -   27   g  3  2         normal-Δ     superscript   subscript  g  2   3     27   superscript   subscript  g  3   2       \Delta=g_{2}^{3}-27g_{3}^{2}     It can be shown that   Δ   normal-Δ   Δ   is a modular form of weight twelve, and one of weight four, so that its third power is also of weight twelve. Thus their quotient, and therefore   j   j   j   , is a modular function of weight zero, in particular a meromorphic function    𝐇  →  𝐂      𝐇  normal-→  𝐂    \mathbf{H}→\mathbf{C}   invariant under the action of    S  L   (  2  ,  𝐙  )       S  L   2  𝐙     SL(2,\mathbf{Z})   . As explained below,   j   j   j   is surjective, which means that it gives a bijection between isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   and the complex numbers.  The fundamental region  (Figure)  The fundamental domain of the modular group acting on the upper half plane.   The two transformations     τ  →  τ   +  1        τ  normal-→  τ   1    τ→τ+1   and together generate a group called the modular group , which we may identify with the projective special linear group     P  S  L   (  2  ,  𝐙  )       P  S  L   2  𝐙     PSL(2,\mathbf{Z})   . By a suitable choice of transformation belonging to this group,        τ  ↦     a  τ   +  b     c  τ   +  d     ,     a  d   -   b  c    =  1    ,     formulae-sequence   maps-to  τ        a  τ   b       c  τ   d           a  d     b  c    1     \tau\mapsto\frac{a\tau+b}{c\tau+d},\qquad ad-bc=1,     we may reduce   τ   τ   τ   to a value giving the same value for   j   j   j   , and lying in the fundamental region for   j   j   j   , which consists of values for   τ   τ   τ   satisfying the conditions      |  τ  |      τ    \displaystyle|\tau|     The function    j   (  τ  )       j  τ    j(τ)   when restricted to this region still takes on every value in the complex numbers    𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   exactly once. In other words, for every   c   c   c   in   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   , there is a unique τ in the fundamental region such that    c  =   j   (  τ  )        c    j  τ     c=j(τ)   . Thus,   j   j   j   has the property of mapping the fundamental region to the entire complex plane.  As a Riemann surface, the fundamental region has genus   0   0    , and every (level one) modular function is a rational function in   j   j   j   ; and, conversely, every rational function in   j   j   j   is a modular function. In other words the field of modular functions is    𝐂   (  j  )       𝐂  j    \mathbf{C}(j)   .  Class field theory and   j   j   j     The   j   j   j   -invariant has many remarkable properties:   If   τ   τ   τ   is any of the singular moduli , that is, any element of an imaginary quadratic field with positive imaginary part (so that   j   j   j   is defined) then    j   (  τ  )       j  τ    j(τ)   is an algebraic integer . 1    The field extension    𝐐  j  j   (  τ  )   ,  τ  /  /  𝐐   (  τ  )      fragments  Q  j  j   fragments  normal-(  τ  normal-)   normal-,  τ    Q   fragments  normal-(  τ  normal-)     \mathbf{Q}jj(τ),τ//\mathbf{Q}(τ)   is abelian, that is, it has an abelian Galois group .    Let   Λ   normal-Λ   Λ   be the lattice in   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   generated by  It is easy to see that all of the elements of    𝐐   (  τ  )       𝐐  τ    \mathbf{Q}(τ)   which fix   Λ   normal-Λ   Λ   under multiplication form a ring with units, called an order . The other lattices with generators  associated in like manner to the same order define the algebraic conjugates     j   (   τ  ′   )       j    τ  normal-′     j(τ′)   of    j   (  τ  )       j  τ    j(τ)   over    𝐐   (  τ  )       𝐐  τ    \mathbf{Q}(τ)   . Ordered by inclusion, the unique maximal order in    𝐐   (  τ  )       𝐐  τ    \mathbf{Q}(τ)   is the ring of algebraic integers of    𝐐   (  τ  )       𝐐  τ    \mathbf{Q}(τ)   , and values of   τ   τ   τ   having it as its associated order lead to unramified extensions of    𝐐   (  τ  )       𝐐  τ    \mathbf{Q}(τ)   .   These classical results are the starting point for the theory of complex multiplication .  Transcendence properties  In 1937 Theodor Schneider proved the aforementioned result that if   τ   τ   τ   is a quadratic irrational number in the upper half plane then    j   (  τ  )       j  τ    j(τ)   is an algebraic integer. In addition he proved that if   τ   τ   τ   is an algebraic number but not imaginary quadratic then    j   (  τ  )       j  τ    j(τ)   is transcendental.  The   j   j   j   function has numerous other transcendental properties. Kurt Mahler conjectured a particular transcendence result that is often referred to as Mahler's conjecture, though it was proved as a corollary of results by Yu. V. Nesterenko and Patrice Phillipon in the 1990s. Mahler's conjecture was that if   τ   τ   τ   was in the upper half plane then    e  x  p   (   2  π  i  τ   )       e  x  p    2  π  i  τ     exp(2πiτ)   and    j   (  τ  )       j  τ    j(τ)   were never both simultaneously algebraic. Stronger results are now known, for example if    e  x  p   (   2  π  i  τ   )       e  x  p    2  π  i  τ     exp(2πiτ)   is algebraic then the following three numbers are algebraically independent, and thus at least two of them transcendental:       j   (  τ  )    ,     j  ′    (  τ  )    π   ,     j  ′′    (  τ  )     π  2         j  τ        superscript  j  normal-′   τ   π        superscript  j  ′′   τ    superscript  π  2      j(\tau),\frac{j^{\prime}(\tau)}{\pi},\frac{j^{\prime\prime}(\tau)}{\pi^{2}}     The   q   q   q   -expansion and moonshine  Several remarkable properties of   j   j   j   have to do with its    q   q   q   -expansion ( Fourier series expansion), written as a Laurent series in terms of    q  =   e  x  p   (   2  π  i  τ   )        q    e  x  p    2  π  i  τ      q=exp(2πiτ)   , which begins:       j   (  τ  )    =    1  q   +  744  +   196884  q   +   21493760   q  2    +   864299970   q  3    +   20245856256   q  4    +  ⋯         j  τ       1  q   744    196884  q     21493760   superscript  q  2      864299970   superscript  q  3      20245856256   superscript  q  4    normal-⋯     j(\tau)={1\over q}+744+196884q+21493760q^{2}+864299970q^{3}+20245856256q^{4}+\cdots     Note that   j   j   j   has a simple pole at the cusp, so its   q   q   q   -expansion has no terms below .  All the Fourier coefficients are integers, which results in several almost integers , notably Ramanujan's constant :       e   π   163     ≈    640320  3   +  744        superscript  e    π    163        superscript  640320  3   744     e^{\pi\sqrt{163}}\approx 640320^{3}+744   .  The asymptotic formula for the coefficient of is given by       e   4  π   n       2    n   3  /  4          superscript  e    4  π    n         2    superscript  n    3  4       \frac{e^{4\pi\sqrt{n}}}{\sqrt{2}n^{3/4}}   ,  as can be proved by Hardy–Littlewood circle method . 2 3  Moonshine  More remarkably, the Fourier coefficients for the positive exponents of   q   q   q   are the dimensions of the graded part of an infinite-dimensional graded algebra representation of the monster group called the moonshine module – specifically, the coefficient of is the dimension of grade-   n   n   n   part of the moonshine module, the first example being the Griess algebra , which has dimension    196  ,  884     196  884    196,884   , corresponding to the term    196884  q      196884  q    196884q   . This startling observation was the starting point for moonshine theory .  The study of the Moonshine conjecture led J.H. Conway and Simon P. Norton to look at the genus-zero modular functions. If they are normalized to have the form       q   -  1    +   O   (  q  )         superscript  q    1      O  q     q^{-1}+{O}(q)     then Thompson showed that there are only a finite number of such functions (of some finite level), and Cummins later showed that there are exactly 6486 of them, 616 of which have integral coefficients. 4  Alternate Expressions  We have       j   (  τ  )    =    256    (   1  -  x   )   3     x  2          j  τ       256   superscript    1  x   3     superscript  x  2      j(\tau)=\frac{256(1-x)^{3}}{x^{2}}     where    x  =   λ   (   1  −  λ   )        x    λ    1  normal-−  λ      x=λ(1−λ)   and   λ   λ   λ   is the modular lambda function       λ   (  τ  )    =     θ  2  4    (  0  ,  τ  )      θ  3  4    (  0  ,  τ  )     =    k  2    (  τ  )            λ  τ        superscript   subscript  θ  2   4    0  τ       superscript   subscript  θ  3   4    0  τ             superscript  k  2   τ      \lambda(\tau)=\frac{\theta_{2}^{4}(0,\tau)}{\theta_{3}^{4}(0,\tau)}=k^{2}(\tau)     a ratio of Jacobi theta functions     θ  m     subscript  θ  m    \theta_{m}   , and is the square of the elliptic modulus     k   (  τ  )       k  τ    k(\tau)   . 5 The value of   j   j   j   is unchanged when λ is replaced by any of the six values of the cross-ratio : 6      {  λ  ,   1   1  -  λ    ,    λ  -  1   λ   ,   1  λ   ,   λ   λ  -  1    ,   1  -  λ   }     λ    1    1  λ        λ  1   λ     1  λ     λ    λ  1      1  λ     \left\{{\lambda,\frac{1}{1-\lambda},\frac{\lambda-1}{\lambda},\frac{1}{\lambda%
 },\frac{\lambda}{\lambda-1},1-\lambda}\right\}     The branch points of   j   j   j   are at  so that   j   j   j   is a Belyi function . 7  Expressions in terms of theta functions  Define the nome     q  =   e   π  i  τ        q   superscript  e    π  i  τ      q=e^{\pi i\tau}   and the Jacobi theta function ,       ϑ   (  0  ;  τ  )    =    ϑ  00    (  0  ;  τ  )    =   1  +   2    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     (   e   π  i  τ    )    n  2       =    ∑   n  =   -  ∞    ∞    q   n  2             ϑ   0  τ       subscript  ϑ  00    0  τ           1    2    superscript   subscript     n  1       superscript   superscript  e    π  i  τ     superscript  n  2              superscript   subscript     n           superscript  q   superscript  n  2        \vartheta(0;\tau)=\vartheta_{00}(0;\tau)=1+2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(e^{\pi i%
 \tau}\right)^{n^{2}}=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}q^{n^{2}}     from which one can derive the auxiliary theta functions . Let,     a   a   \displaystyle a     where    θ  m     subscript  θ  m    \theta_{m}   and    ϑ  n     subscript  ϑ  n    \vartheta_{n}   are alternative notations, and       a  4   -   b  4    +   c  4    =  0           superscript  a  4    superscript  b  4     superscript  c  4    0    a^{4}-b^{4}+c^{4}=0   .

We can then express j ( τ ) in a form which can rapidly be computed.       j   (  τ  )    =   1728    g  2  3     g  2  3   -   27   g  3  2       =   32     (    a  8   +   b  8   +   c  8    )   3     (   a  b  c   )   8             j  τ     1728     superscript   subscript  g  2   3      superscript   subscript  g  2   3     27   superscript   subscript  g  3   2              32     superscript     superscript  a  8    superscript  b  8    superscript  c  8    3    superscript    a  b  c   8        j(\tau)=1728\frac{g_{2}^{3}}{g_{2}^{3}-27g_{3}^{2}}=32{(a^{8}+b^{8}+c^{8})^{3}%
 \over(abc)^{8}}     Algebraic definition  So far we have been considering   j   j   j   as a function of a complex variable. However, as an invariant for isomorphism classes of elliptic curves, it can be defined purely algebraically. Let        y  2   +    a  1   x  y   +    a  3   y    =    x  3   +    a  2    x  2    +    a  4   x   +   a  6           superscript  y  2      subscript  a  1   x  y      subscript  a  3   y       superscript  x  3      subscript  a  2    superscript  x  2       subscript  a  4   x    subscript  a  6      y^{2}+a_{1}xy+a_{3}y=x^{3}+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{4}x+a_{6}     be a plane elliptic curve over any field. Then we may define        b  2   =    a  1  2   +   4   a  2      ,    b  4   =     a  1    a  3    +   2   a  4         formulae-sequence     subscript  b  2      superscript   subscript  a  1   2     4   subscript  a  2         subscript  b  4        subscript  a  1    subscript  a  3      2   subscript  a  4        b_{2}=a_{1}^{2}+4a_{2},\quad b_{4}=a_{1}a_{3}+2a_{4}           b  6   =    a  3  2   +   4   a  6      ,    b  8   =       a  1  2    a  6    -    a  1    a  3    a  4     +    a  2    a  3  2    +   4   a  2    a  6     -   a  4  2        formulae-sequence     subscript  b  6      superscript   subscript  a  3   2     4   subscript  a  6         subscript  b  8            superscript   subscript  a  1   2    subscript  a  6       subscript  a  1    subscript  a  3    subscript  a  4        subscript  a  2    superscript   subscript  a  3   2      4   subscript  a  2    subscript  a  6      superscript   subscript  a  4   2       b_{6}=a_{3}^{2}+4a_{6},\quad b_{8}=a_{1}^{2}a_{6}-a_{1}a_{3}a_{4}+a_{2}a_{3}^{%

The   j   j   j   -invariant for the elliptic curve may now be defined as      j  =    c  4  3   Δ       j     superscript   subscript  c  4   3   normal-Δ     j={c_{4}^{3}\over\Delta}     In the case that the field over which the curve is defined has characteristic different from 2 or 3, this definition can also be written as      j  =   1728    c  4  3     c  4  3   -   c  6  2          j    1728     superscript   subscript  c  4   3      superscript   subscript  c  4   3    superscript   subscript  c  6   2        j=1728{c_{4}^{3}\over c_{4}^{3}-c_{6}^{2}}     Inverse function  The inverse function of the   j   j   j   -invariant can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function  (see also the article Picard–Fuchs equation ). Explicitly, given a number   N   N   N   , to solve the equation     j   (  τ  )    =  N        j  τ   N    j(τ)=N   for   τ   τ   τ   can be done in at least four ways.  Method 1 : Solving the sextic in   λ   λ   λ   ,       j   (  τ  )    =    256    (   1  -   λ   (   1  -  λ   )     )   3      (   λ   (   1  -  λ   )    )   2          j  τ       256   superscript    1    λ    1  λ     3     superscript    λ    1  λ    2      j(\tau)=\frac{256(1-\lambda(1-\lambda))^{3}}{(\lambda(1-\lambda))^{2}}     where   λ   λ   λ   is the modular lambda function . Let    x  =   λ   (   1  −  λ   )        x    λ    1  normal-−  λ      x=λ(1−λ)   and the sextic can be solved as a cubic in   x   x   x   . Then,      τ  =    i      F  1    2     (   1  2   ,   1  2   ,  1  ,   1  -  λ   )      F  1    2     (   1  2   ,   1  2   ,  1  ,  λ  )          τ    i       subscript   subscript  F  1   2      1  2     1  2   1    1  λ        subscript   subscript  F  1   2      1  2     1  2   1  λ        \tau=i\ \frac{{}_{2}F_{1}\left(\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{1}{2},1,1-\lambda\right)}{{%

Method 2 : Solving the quartic in   γ   γ   γ   ,       j   (  τ  )    =    27    (   1  +   8  γ    )   3     γ    (   1  -  γ   )   3           j  τ       27   superscript    1    8  γ    3      γ   superscript    1  γ   3       j(\tau)=\frac{27(1+8\gamma)^{3}}{\gamma(1-\gamma)^{3}}     then for any of the four roots ,      τ  =    i   3       F  1    2     (   1  3   ,   2  3   ,  1  ,   1  -  γ   )      F  1    2     (   1  3   ,   2  3   ,  1  ,  γ  )          τ      i    3         subscript   subscript  F  1   2      1  3     2  3   1    1  γ        subscript   subscript  F  1   2      1  3     2  3   1  γ        \tau=\frac{i}{\sqrt{3}}\frac{{}_{2}F_{1}\left(\tfrac{1}{3},\tfrac{2}{3},1,1-%

 _{2}F_{1}\left(\tfrac{1}{6},\tfrac{5}{6},1,\alpha\right)}     One root gives   τ   τ   τ   , and the other gives    1  /  τ      1  τ    1/τ   , but since     j   (  τ  )    =   j   (   1  /  τ   )          j  τ     j    1  τ      j(τ)=j(1/τ)   , then it doesn't make a difference which   α   α   α   is chosen. The latter three methods can be found in Ramanujan 's theory of elliptic functions to alternative bases.  The inversion is highly relevant to applications via enabling high-precision calculations of elliptic functions periods even as their ratios become unbounded. A related result is the expressibility via quadratic radicals of the values of   j   j   j   at the points of the imaginary axis whose magnitudes are powers of 2 (thus permitting compass and straightedge constructions ). The latter result is hardly evident since the modular equation of level 2 is cubic.
