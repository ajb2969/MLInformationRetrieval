<h1>DNA microarray</h1>
<hr/>

<p>A <strong>DNA <a class="uri" href="microarray" title="wikilink">microarray</a></strong> (also commonly known as <a class="uri" href="DNA" title="wikilink">DNA</a> chip or <a class="uri" href="biochip" title="wikilink">biochip</a>) is a collection of microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface. Scientists use DNA microarrays to measure the <a href="Gene_Expression" title="wikilink">expression</a> levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously or to <a class="uri" href="genotype" title="wikilink">genotype</a> multiple regions of a genome. Each DNA spot contains <a href="Pico-" title="wikilink">picomoles</a> (10<sup>−12</sup> <a href="Mole_(unit)" title="wikilink">moles</a>) of a specific DNA sequence, known as <em><a href="Hybridization_probe" title="wikilink">probes</a></em> (or <em>reporters</em> or <em><a href="oligonucleotide" title="wikilink">oligos</a></em>). These can be a short section of a <a class="uri" href="gene" title="wikilink">gene</a> or other DNA element that are used to <a href="Nucleic_acid_hybridization#Hybridization" title="wikilink">hybridize</a> a <a class="uri" href="cDNA" title="wikilink">cDNA</a> or cRNA (also called anti-sense RNA) sample (called <em>target</em>) under high-stringency conditions. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected and quantified by detection of <a class="uri" href="fluorophore" title="wikilink">fluorophore</a>-, silver-, or <a class="uri" href="chemiluminescence" title="wikilink">chemiluminescence</a>-labeled targets to determine relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in the target.</p>
<h2 id="the-basic-microarray">The Basic Microarray</h2>

<p>Since an array can contain tens of thousands of probes, a microarray experiment can accomplish many <a href="genetic_test" title="wikilink">genetic tests</a> in parallel. Therefore arrays have dramatically accelerated many types of investigation. In standard microarrays, the probes are <a href="oligonucleotide_synthesis" title="wikilink">synthesized</a> and then attached via <a href="surface_engineering" title="wikilink">surface engineering</a> to a solid surface by a <a href="covalent_bond" title="wikilink">covalent bond</a> to a chemical matrix (via <a class="uri" href="epoxy" title="wikilink">epoxy</a>-silane, <a href="amine" title="wikilink">amino</a>-silane, <a class="uri" href="lysine" title="wikilink">lysine</a>, <a class="uri" href="polyacrylamide" title="wikilink">polyacrylamide</a> or others). The solid surface can be <a class="uri" href="glass" title="wikilink">glass</a> or a silicon chip, in which case they are colloquially known as an <em>Affy chip</em> when an <a class="uri" href="Affymetrix" title="wikilink">Affymetrix</a> chip is used. Other microarray platforms, such as <a href="Illumina_(company)" title="wikilink">Illumina</a>, use microscopic beads, instead of the large solid support. Alternatively, microarrays can be constructed by the direct <a href="oligonucleotide_synthesis" title="wikilink">synthesis of oligonucleotide probes</a> on solid surfaces. DNA arrays are different from other types of microarray only in that they either measure DNA or use DNA as part of their detection system.</p>

<p>DNA microarrays can be used to measure changes in <a href="Gene_expression" title="wikilink">expression</a> levels, to detect <a href="single_nucleotide_polymorphism" title="wikilink">single nucleotide polymorphisms</a> (SNPs), or to genotype or targeted resequencing (<em>see <a href="DNA_microarray#Uses_and_types" title="wikilink">uses and types</a> section</em>). Microarrays also differ in fabrication, workings, accuracy, efficiency, and cost (<em>see <a href="DNA_microarray#Fabrication" title="wikilink">fabrication</a> section</em>). Additional factors for microarray experiments are the experimental design and the methods of analyzing the data (<em>see <a href="DNA_microarray#Microarrays_and_bioinformatics" title="wikilink">Bioinformatics</a> section</em>).</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Microarray technology evolved from <a href="Southern_blotting" title="wikilink">Southern blotting</a>, where fragmented DNA is attached to a <a href="Substrate_(biochemistry)" title="wikilink">substrate</a> and then probed with a known DNA sequence.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The first reported use of this approach was the analysis of 378 arrayed lysed bacterial colonies each harboring a different sequence which were assayed in multiple replicas for expression of the genes in multiple normal and tumor tissue.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> This was expanded to an analysis of more than 4000 human sequences with computer driven scanning and image processing for quantitative analysis of the sequences in human colonic tumors and normal tissue<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and then to comparison of colonic tissues at different genetic risk.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The use of a collection of distinct DNAs in arrays for expression profiling was also described in 1987, and the arrayed DNAs were used to identify genes whose expression is modulated by interferon.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> These early gene arrays were made by spotting cDNAs onto <a href="filter_paper" title="wikilink">filter paper</a> with a pin-spotting device. The use of miniaturized microarrays for gene expression profiling was first reported in 1995,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and a complete <a href="Eukaryote" title="wikilink">eukaryotic</a> genome (<em><a href="Saccharomyces_cerevisiae" title="wikilink">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a></em>) on a microarray was published in 1997.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="principle">Principle</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>The core principle behind microarrays is hybridization between two DNA strands, the property of <a href="Complementarity_(molecular_biology)" title="wikilink">complementary</a> nucleic acid sequences to specifically pair with each other by forming <a href="hydrogen_bond" title="wikilink">hydrogen bonds</a> between complementary <a href="Nucleotide" title="wikilink">nucleotide base pairs</a>. A high number of complementary base pairs in a nucleotide sequence means tighter <a class="uri" href="non-covalent" title="wikilink">non-covalent</a> bonding between the two strands. After washing off non-specific bonding sequences, only strongly paired strands will remain hybridized. Fluorescently labeled target sequences that bind to a probe sequence generate a signal that depends on the hybridization conditions (such as temperature), and washing after hybridization. Total strength of the signal, from a spot (feature), depends upon the amount of target sample binding to the probes present on that spot. Microarrays use relative quantitation in which the intensity of a feature is compared to the intensity of the same feature under a different condition, and the identity of the feature is known by its position.</p>

<h2 id="uses-and-types">Uses and types</h2>

<p> Many types of arrays exist and the broadest distinction is whether they are spatially arranged on a surface or on coded beads:</p>
<ul>
<li>The traditional solid-phase array is a collection of orderly microscopic "spots", called features, each with thousands of identical and specific probes attached to a solid surface, such as <a class="uri" href="glass" title="wikilink">glass</a>, <a class="uri" href="plastic" title="wikilink">plastic</a> or <a class="uri" href="silicon" title="wikilink">silicon</a> <a class="uri" href="biochip" title="wikilink">biochip</a> (commonly known as a <em>genome chip</em>, <em>DNA chip</em> or <em>gene array</em>). Thousands of these features can be placed in known locations on a single DNA microarray.</li>
<li>The alternative bead array is a collection of microscopic polystyrene beads, each with a specific probe and a ratio of two or more dyes, which do not interfere with the fluorescent dyes used on the target sequence.</li>
</ul>

<p>DNA microarrays can be used to detect DNA (as in <a href="comparative_genomic_hybridization" title="wikilink">comparative genomic hybridization</a>), or detect RNA (most commonly as <a class="uri" href="cDNA" title="wikilink">cDNA</a> after <a href="reverse_transcription" title="wikilink">reverse transcription</a>) that may or may not be translated into proteins. The process of measuring gene expression via cDNA is called <a href="gene_expression" title="wikilink">expression analysis</a> or <a href="expression_profiling" title="wikilink">expression profiling</a>.</p>

<h3 id="fabrication">Fabrication</h3>

<p>Microarrays can be manufactured in different ways, depending on the number of probes under examination, costs, customization requirements, and the type of scientific question being asked. Arrays may have as few as 10 probes or up to 2.1 million micrometre-scale probes from commercial vendors.</p>

</figure>

<p>Microarrays can be fabricated using a variety of technologies, including printing with fine-pointed pins onto glass slides, <a class="uri" href="photolithography" title="wikilink">photolithography</a> using pre-made masks, photolithography using dynamic micromirror devices, ink-jet printing,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> or <a class="uri" href="electrochemistry" title="wikilink">electrochemistry</a> on microelectrode arrays.</p>

<p>In <em>spotted microarrays</em>, the probes are <a href="oligonucleotide_synthesis" title="wikilink">oligonucleotides</a>, <a class="uri" href="cDNA" title="wikilink">cDNA</a> or small fragments of <a class="uri" href="PCR" title="wikilink">PCR</a> products that correspond to <a href="mRNA" title="wikilink">mRNAs</a>. The probes are <a href="oligonucleotide_synthesis" title="wikilink">synthesized</a> prior to deposition on the array surface and are then "spotted" onto glass. A common approach utilizes an array of fine pins or needles controlled by a robotic arm that is dipped into wells containing DNA probes and then depositing each probe at designated locations on the array surface. The resulting "grid" of probes represents the nucleic acid profiles of the prepared probes and is ready to receive complementary cDNA or cRNA "targets" derived from experimental or clinical samples. This technique is used by research scientists around the world to produce "in-house" printed microarrays from their own labs. These arrays may be easily customized for each experiment, because researchers can choose the probes and printing locations on the arrays, synthesize the probes in their own lab (or collaborating facility), and spot the arrays. They can then generate their own labeled samples for hybridization, hybridize the samples to the array, and finally scan the arrays with their own equipment. This provides a relatively low-cost microarray that may be customized for each study, and avoids the costs of purchasing often more expensive commercial arrays that may represent vast numbers of genes that are not of interest to the investigator. Publications exist which indicate in-house spotted microarrays may not provide the same level of sensitivity compared to commercial oligonucleotide arrays,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> possibly owing to the small batch sizes and reduced printing efficiencies when compared to industrial manufactures of oligo arrays.</p>

<p>In <em>oligonucleotide microarrays</em>, the probes are short sequences designed to match parts of the sequence of known or predicted <a href="open_reading_frame" title="wikilink">open reading frames</a>. Although oligonucleotide probes are often used in "spotted" microarrays, the term "oligonucleotide array" most often refers to a specific technique of manufacturing. Oligonucleotide arrays are produced by printing short oligonucleotide sequences designed to represent a single gene or family of gene splice-variants by <a href="oligonucleotide_synthesis" title="wikilink">synthesizing</a> this sequence directly onto the array surface instead of depositing intact sequences. Sequences may be longer (60-mer probes such as the <a class="uri" href="Agilent" title="wikilink">Agilent</a> design) or shorter (25-mer probes produced by <a class="uri" href="Affymetrix" title="wikilink">Affymetrix</a>) depending on the desired purpose; longer probes are more specific to individual target genes, shorter probes may be spotted in higher density across the array and are cheaper to manufacture. One technique used to produce oligonucleotide arrays include <a class="uri" href="photolithographic" title="wikilink">photolithographic</a> synthesis (Affymetrix) on a silica substrate where light and light-sensitive masking agents are used to "build" a sequence one nucleotide at a time across the entire array.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Each applicable probe is selectively "unmasked" prior to bathing the array in a solution of a single nucleotide, then a masking reaction takes place and the next set of probes are unmasked in preparation for a different nucleotide exposure. After many repetitions, the sequences of every probe become fully constructed. More recently, Maskless Array Synthesis from NimbleGen Systems has combined flexibility with large numbers of probes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

</figure>

<p><em>Two-color microarrays</em> or <em>two-channel microarrays</em> are typically <a href="DNA_hybridization" title="wikilink">hybridized</a> with cDNA prepared from two samples to be compared (e.g. diseased tissue versus healthy tissue) and that are labeled with two different <a href="fluorophore" title="wikilink">fluorophores</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> <a href="Fluorescence" title="wikilink">Fluorescent</a> dyes commonly used for cDNA labeling include <a href="Cyanine" title="wikilink">Cy</a>3, which has a fluorescence emission wavelength of 570 nm (corresponding to the orange part of the light spectrum), and <a href="Cyanine" title="wikilink">Cy</a>5 with a fluorescence emission wavelength of 670 nm (corresponding to the red part of the light spectrum). The two Cy-labeled cDNA samples are mixed and hybridized to a single microarray that is then scanned in a microarray scanner to visualize fluorescence of the two fluorophores after <a href="Excited_state" title="wikilink">excitation</a> with a <a class="uri" href="laser" title="wikilink">laser</a> beam of a defined wavelength. Relative intensities of each fluorophore may then be used in ratio-based analysis to identify up-regulated and down-regulated genes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>Oligonucleotide microarrays often carry control probes designed to hybridize with <a href="RNA_spike-in" title="wikilink">RNA spike-ins</a>. The degree of hybridization between the spike-ins and the control probes is used to <a href="Normalization_(statistics)" title="wikilink">normalize</a> the hybridization measurements for the target probes. Although absolute levels of gene expression may be determined in the two-color array in rare instances, the relative differences in expression among different spots within a sample and between samples is the preferred method of <a href="data_analysis" title="wikilink">data analysis</a> for the two-color system. Examples of providers for such microarrays includes <a class="uri" href="Agilent" title="wikilink">Agilent</a> with their Dual-Mode platform, <a href="Eppendorf_(company)" title="wikilink">Eppendorf</a> with their DualChip platform for colorimetric <a class="uri" href="Silverquant" title="wikilink">Silverquant</a> labeling, and TeleChem International with <a class="uri" href="Arrayit" title="wikilink">Arrayit</a>.</p>

<p>In <em>single-channel microarrays</em> or <em>one-color microarrays</em>, the arrays provide intensity data for each probe or probe set indicating a relative level of hybridization with the labeled target. However, they do not truly indicate abundance levels of a gene but rather relative abundance when compared to other samples or conditions when processed in the same experiment. Each RNA molecule encounters protocol and batch-specific bias during amplification, labeling, and hybridization phases of the experiment making comparisons between genes for the same microarray uninformative. The comparison of two conditions for the same gene requires two separate single-dye hybridizations. Several popular single-channel systems are the Affymetrix "Gene Chip", Illumina "Bead Chip", Agilent single-channel arrays, the Applied Microarrays "CodeLink" arrays, and the Eppendorf "DualChip &amp; Silverquant". One strength of the single-dye system lies in the fact that an aberrant sample cannot affect the raw data derived from other samples, because each array chip is exposed to only one sample (as opposed to a two-color system in which a single low-quality sample may drastically impinge on overall data precision even if the other sample was of high quality). Another benefit is that data are more easily compared to arrays from different experiments as long as batch effects have been accounted for.</p>

<p>One channel microarray may be the only choice in some situations. Suppose

 samples need to be compare: then the number of experiments required using the two channel arrays quickly becomes unfeasible, unless a sample is used as a reference.</p>

<p>The advent of inexpensive microarray experiments created several specific bioinformatics challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>the multiple levels of replication in experimental design (<a href="#Experimental_design" title="wikilink">Experimental design</a>)</li>
<li>the number of platforms and independent groups and data format (<a href="#Standardization" title="wikilink">Standardization</a>)</li>
<li>the treatment of the data (<a href="#Statistical_analysis" title="wikilink">Statistical analysis</a>)</li>
<li>accuracy and precision (<a href="#Relation_between_probe_and_gene" title="wikilink">Relation between probe and gene</a>)</li>
<li>the sheer volume of data and the ability to share it (<a href="#Data_warehousing" title="wikilink">Data warehousing</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="experimental-design">Experimental design</h3>

<p>Due to the biological complexity of gene expression, the considerations of experimental design that are discussed in the <a href="expression_profiling" title="wikilink">expression profiling</a> article are of critical importance if statistically and biologically valid conclusions are to be drawn from the data.</p>

<p>There are three main elements to consider when designing a microarray experiment. First, replication of the biological samples is essential for drawing conclusions from the experiment. Second, technical replicates (two RNA samples obtained from each experimental unit) help to ensure precision and allow for testing differences within treatment groups. The biological replicates include independent RNA extractions and technical replicates may be two <a href="wikt:Special:Search/aliquot" title="wikilink">aliquots</a> of the same extraction. Third, spots of each cDNA clone or oligonucleotide are present as replicates (at least duplicates) on the microarray slide, to provide a measure of technical precision in each hybridization. It is critical that information about the sample preparation and handling is discussed, in order to help identify the independent units in the experiment and to avoid inflated estimates of <a href="statistical_significance" title="wikilink">statistical significance</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="standardization">Standardization</h3>

<p>Microarray data is difficult to exchange due to the lack of standardization in platform fabrication, assay protocols, and analysis methods. This presents an <a class="uri" href="interoperability" title="wikilink">interoperability</a> problem in <a class="uri" href="bioinformatics" title="wikilink">bioinformatics</a>. Various <a class="uri" href="grass-roots" title="wikilink">grass-roots</a> <a href="open_source" title="wikilink">open-source</a> projects are trying to ease the exchange and analysis of data produced with non-proprietary chips:</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the "Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment" (<a class="uri" href="MIAME" title="wikilink">MIAME</a>) checklist helps define the level of detail that should exist and is being adopted by many <a href="Scientific_journal" title="wikilink">journals</a> as a requirement for the submission of papers incorporating microarray results. But MIAME does not describe the format for the information, so while many formats can support the MIAME requirements,  no format permits verification of complete semantic compliance.</li>
<li>The "MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) Project" is being conducted by the US <a href="Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="wikilink">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) to develop standards and quality control metrics which will eventually allow the use of MicroArray data in drug discovery, clinical practice and regulatory decision-making.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></li>
<li>The <a href="MGED_Society" title="wikilink">MGED Society</a> has developed standards for the representation of gene expression experiment results and relevant annotations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-analysis">Data analysis</h3>

<p>Microarray data sets are commonly very large, and analytical precision is influenced by a number of variables. <a href="Statistics" title="wikilink">Statistical</a> challenges include taking into account effects of background noise and appropriate <a href="Normalization_(statistics)" title="wikilink">normalization</a> of the data. Normalization methods may be suited to specific platforms and, in the case of commercial platforms, the analysis may be proprietary. Algorithms that affect statistical analysis include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image analysis: gridding, spot recognition of the scanned image (segmentation algorithm), removal or marking of poor-quality and low-intensity features (called <em>flagging</em>).</li>
<li>Data processing: background subtraction (based on global or local background), determination of spot intensities and intensity ratios, visualisation of data (e.g. see <a href="MA_plot" title="wikilink">MA plot</a>), and log-transformation of ratios, global or <a href="Local_regression" title="wikilink">local</a> normalization of intensity ratios, and segmentation into different copy number regions using <a href="step_detection" title="wikilink">step detection</a> algorithms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></li>
<li>Class discovery analysis: This analytic approach, sometimes called unsupervised classification or knowledge discovery, tries to identify whether microarrays (objects, patients, mice, etc.) or genes cluster together in groups. Identifying naturally existing groups of objects (microarrays or genes) which cluster together can enable the discovery of new groups that otherwise were not previously known to exist. During knowledge discovery analysis, various unsupervised classification techniques can be employed with DNA microarray data to identify novel clusters (classes) of arrays.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> This type of approach is not hypothesis-driven, but rather is based on iterative pattern recognition or statistical learning methods to find an "optimal" number of clusters in the data. Examples of unsupervised analyses methods include self-organizing maps, neural gas, k-means cluster analyses,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> hierarchical cluster analysis, Genomic Signal Processing based clustering<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and model-based cluster analysis. For some of these methods the user also has to define a distance measure between pairs of objects. Although the Pearson correlation coefficient is usually employed, several other measures have been proposed and evaluated in the literature.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The input data used in class discovery analyses are commonly based on lists of genes having high informativeness (low noise) based on low values of the coefficient of variation or high values of Shannon entropy, etc. The determination of the most likely or optimal number of clusters obtained from an unsupervised analysis is called cluster validity. Some commonly used metrics for cluster validity are the silhouette index, Davies-Bouldin index,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Dunn's index, or Hubert's

 statistic.</li>
<li>Class prediction analysis: This approach, called supervised classification, establishes the basis for developing a predictive model into which future unknown test objects can be input in order to predict the most likely class membership of the test objects. Supervised analysis<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> for class prediction involves use of techniques such as linear regression, k-nearest neighbor, learning vector quantization, decision tree analysis, random forests, naive Bayes, logistic regression, kernel regression, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, mixture of experts, and supervised neural gas. In addition, various metaheuristic methods are employed, such as genetic algorithms, covariance matrix self-adaptation, particle swarm optimization, and ant colony optimization. Input data for class prediction are usually based on filtered lists of genes which are predictive of class, determined using classical hypothesis tests (next section), Gini diversity index, or information gain (entropy).</li>
<li>Hypothesis-driven statistical analysis: Identification of statistically significant changes in gene expression are commonly identified using the <a class="uri" href="t-test" title="wikilink">t-test</a>, <a class="uri" href="ANOVA" title="wikilink">ANOVA</a>, <a href="Bayesian_method" title="wikilink">Bayesian method</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> <a href="Mann–Whitney_test" title="wikilink">Mann–Whitney test</a> methods tailored to microarray data sets, which take into account <a href="multiple_comparisons" title="wikilink">multiple comparisons</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> or <a href="cluster_analysis" title="wikilink">cluster analysis</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> These methods assess statistical power based on the variation present in the data and the number of experimental replicates, and can help minimize <a href="Type_I_and_type_II_errors" title="wikilink">Type I and type II errors</a> in the analyses.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dimensional reduction: Analysts often reduce the number of dimensions (genes) prior to data analysis.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> This may involve linear approaches such as principal components analysis (PCA), or non-linear manifold learning (distance metric learning) using kernel PCA, diffusion maps, Laplacian eigenmaps, local linear embedding, locally preserving projections, and Sammon's mapping.</li>
<li>Network-based methods: Statistical methods that take the underlying structure of gene networks into account, representing either associative or causative interactions or dependencies among gene products.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <a href="Weighted_Correlation_Network_Analysis" title="wikilink">Weighted gene co-expression network analysis</a> is widely used for identifying co-expression modules and intramodular hub genes. Modules may corresponds to cell types or pathways. Highly connected intramodular hubs best represent their respective modules.</li>
</ul>

<p>Microarray data may require further processing aimed at reducing the dimensionality of the data to aid comprehension and more focused analysis.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Other methods permit analysis of data consisting of a low number of biological or technical <a href="Replication_(statistics)" title="wikilink">replicates</a>; for example, the Local Pooled Error (LPE) test pools <a href="standard_deviation" title="wikilink">standard deviations</a> of genes with similar expression levels in an effort to compensate for insufficient replication.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="relation-between-probe-and-gene">Relation between probe and gene</h3>

<p>The relation between a probe and the <a class="uri" href="mRNA" title="wikilink">mRNA</a> that it is expected to detect is not trivial. Some mRNAs may cross-hybridize probes in the array that are supposed to detect another mRNA. In addition, mRNAs may experience amplification bias that is sequence or molecule-specific. Thirdly, probes that are designed to detect the mRNA of a particular gene may be relying on genomic <a href="Expressed_sequence_tag" title="wikilink">EST</a> information that is incorrectly associated with that gene.</p>
<h3 id="data-warehousing">Data warehousing</h3>

<p>Microarray data was found to be more useful when compared to other similar datasets. The sheer volume of data, specialized formats (such as <a class="uri" href="MIAME" title="wikilink">MIAME</a>), and curation efforts associated with the datasets require specialized databases to store the data. A number of open-source data warehousing solutions, such as <a class="uri" href="InterMine" title="wikilink">InterMine</a> and <a href="http://www.biomart.org/">BioMart</a>, have been created for the specific purpose of integrating diverse biological datasets, and also support analysis.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-technologies">Alternative technologies</h2>

<p>Advances in massively parallel sequencing has led to the development of <a class="uri" href="RNA-Seq" title="wikilink">RNA-Seq</a> technology, that enables a whole transcriptome shotgun approach to characterize and quantify gene expression.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Unlike microarrays, which need a reference genome and transcriptome to be available before the microarray itself can be designed, RNA-Seq can also be used for new model organisms whose genome has not been sequenced yet.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
