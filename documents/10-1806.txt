   N-acetylornithine carbamoyltransferase      N-acetylornithine carbamoyltransferase   In enzymology , a N-acetylornithine carbamoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   carbamoyl phosphate + N 2 -acetyl-L-ornithine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phosphate + N-acetyl-L-citrulline   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are carbamoyl phosphate and N2-acetyl-L-ornithine , whereas its two products are phosphate and N-acetyl-L-citrulline .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases that transfer one-carbon groups, specifically the carboxy- and carbamoyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is carbamoyl-phosphate:N2-acetyl-L-ornithine carbamoyltransferase . Other names in common use include acetylornithine transcarbamylase , N-acetylornithine transcarbamylase , AOTC , and carbamoyl-phosphate:2-N-acetyl-L-ornithine carbamoyltransferase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
