Simple precedence grammar

A simple precedence grammar is a context-free formal grammar that can be parsed with a simple precedence parser.1 The concept was first developed by Niklaus Wirth and Helmut Weber from the ideas of Robert Floyd in their paper, EULER: a generalization of ALGOL, and its formal definition, in the Communications of the ACM in 1966.2
Formal definition
G = (N, Σ, P, S) is a simple precedence grammar if all the production rules in P comply with the following constraints:

There are no erasing rules (ε-productions)
There are no useless rules (unreachable symbols or unproductive rules)
For each pair of symbols X, Y (X, Y

 
  (N ∪ Σ)) there is only one Wirth–Weber precedence relation.
G is uniquely inversible
