L-threonate 3-dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a L-threonate 3-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-threonate + NAD+

 
  3-dehydro-L-threonate + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-threonate and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are 3-dehydro-L-threonate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-threonate:NAD+ 3-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include threonate dehydrogenase, and L-threonic acid dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism.
