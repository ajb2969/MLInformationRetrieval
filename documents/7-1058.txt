Lorentz–Heaviside units

Lorentz–Heaviside units (or Heaviside–Lorentz units) constitute a system of units (particularly electromagnetic units) within CGS, named for Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and Oliver Heaviside. They share with CGS-Gaussian units the property that the electric constant  and magnetic constant  do not appear, having been incorporated implicitly into the unit system and electromagnetic equations. Lorentz–Heaviside units may be regarded as normalizing  and , while at the same time revising Maxwell's equations to use the speed of light

 
  instead.
Lorentz–Heaviside units, like SI units but unlike Gaussian units, are rationalized, meaning that there are no factors of 
 
 
 
  appearing explicitly in Maxwell's equations.12 The fact that these units are rationalized partly explains their appeal in quantum field theory: the Lagrangian underlying the theory does not have any factors of 
 
 
 
  in these units.3 Consequently Lorentz–Heaviside units differ by factors of 
 
 
 
 
  in the definitions of the electric and magnetic fields and of electric charge. They are particularly convenient when performing calculations in spatial dimensions greater than three such as in string theory. They are often used in relativistic calculations.
Length–Mass–Time Framework
As in the Gaussian units, the Heaviside–Lorentz units use the length–mass–time dimensions. This means that all of the electric and magnetic units are derived units, dependent on the sizes of length and force.
Coulomb's equation, used to derive the unit of charge, is  in the Gaussian system, and  in the HLU. The unit of charge then connects to . The HLU charge is then 
 
 
 
  larger than the Gaussian (see below), and the rest follow.
When the dimensional analysis for the Gaussian units are used, including ε and μ are used to convert units, the result gives the conversion to and from the Heaviside–Lorentz units. For example, charge is . When one puts 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 
  second, this evaluates as . This is the size of the HLU unit of charge.
Because the Heaviside–Lorentz units continue to use separate electric and magnetic units, an additional constant is needed when electric and magnetic quantities appear in the same formula. As in the Gaussian system, this constant appears as the electromagnetic velocity 
 
 
 
 .
Rationalization
In system-independent form, the Maxwell equations are


 
 
  along with  and . The constants 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  vary from system to system. One can show that .

The Gaussian system puts 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
 
The HLU system puts 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
 
The SI system puts 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
 

What rationalisation does is to replace the radiance constant (
 
 
 
  = intensity at radius2 / source) with the gaussian divergence constant (
 
 
 
  = flux through a surface / enclosed sources). One can easily show that 
 
 
 
 , by considering the case of a sphere around a point, and intensity as density of flux. The older models set 
 
 
 
 
 , while the rationalised systems have 
 
 
 
 . Rationalized equations in physics generally have a factor related to the effective spatial symmetry: 
 
 
 
  for planar symmetry, 
 
 
 
  for cylindrical symmetry and 
 
 
 
  for spherical symmetry.
The constant 
 
 
 
 
  connects the electric and magnetic units through 
 
 
 
 . When electric and magnetic systems are defined as in the Gaussian or Heaviside–Lorentz systems, 
 
 
 
  derives from the electromagnetic wave equations. Most systems have 
 
 
 
 , where the electric and magnetic systems are connected by 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, most books use 
 
 
 
 
  instead of 
 
 
 
 .
Maxwell's equations with sources
With Lorentz–Heaviside units, Maxwell's equations in free space with sources take the following form:












where 
 
 
 
  is the speed of light in vacuum. Here 
 
 
 
  is the electric field, 
 
 
 
  is the magnetic field, 
 
 
 
  is charge density, and 
 
 
 
 
  is current density.
The Lorentz force equation is:








here 
 
 
 
  is the charge of a test particle with vector velocity  and  is the combined electric and magnetic force acting on that test particle.
In both the Gaussian and Heaviside–Lorentz systems, the electrical and magnetic units are derived from the mechanical systems. Charge is defined through Coulomb's equation, with 
 
 
 
 . In the gaussian system, Coulomb's equation is . In the Heaviside Lorentz system, . From this, one sees that 
 
 
 
 , that the Gaussian units are larger by a factor of 
 
 
 
 
 . Other quantities follow as follows.

List of equations and comparison with other systems of units
This section has a list of the basic formulae of electromagnetism, given in Lorentz-Heaviside, Gaussian and SI units. Most symbol names are not given; for complete explanations and definitions, please click to the appropriate dedicated article for each equation.
Maxwell's equations
Here are Maxwell's equations, both in macroscopic and microscopic forms. Only the "differential form" of the equations is given, not the "integral form"; to get the integral forms apply the divergence theorem or Kelvin–Stokes theorem.

Dielectric and magnetic materials
Below are the expressions for the various fields in a dielectric medium. It is assumed here for simplicity that the medium is homogeneous, linear, isotropic, and nondispersive, so that the permittivity is a simple constant.

General rules to translate a formula
To convert any formula from Lorentz–Heaviside units to Gaussian or to SI units, replace the quantity in the Lorentz-Heaviside column by the quantity in the Gaussian column or in the SI column (vice versa to convert the other way). This will reproduce any of the specific formulas given in the list above, such as Maxwell's equations. It may also be necessary to use the relation 
 
 
 
  to simplify.

Replacing CGS with natural units
When one takes standard SI textbook equations, and sets 
 
 
 
  to get natural units, the resulting equations follow the Heaviside–Lorentz formulation and sizes. The conversion requires no changes to the factor 
 
 
 
 , unlike for the Gaussian equations. Coulomb's inverse-square law equation in SI is . Set 
 
 
 
  to get the HLU form: . The Gaussian form does not have the 
 
 
 
 
  in the denominator.
By setting 
 
 
 
  with HLU, Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz equation become the same as the SI example with 
 
 
 
 .




















Because these equations can be easily related to SI work, HLU-style (i.e. rationalized) systems are becoming more fashionable.
