   Relative viscosity      Relative viscosity   Relative viscosity (    η  r     subscript  η  r    \eta_{r}   ) (a synonym of "viscosity ratio") is the ratio of the viscosity of a solution (   η   η   \eta   ) to the viscosity of the solvent used (    η  s     subscript  η  s    \eta_{s}   ),       η  r   =   η   η  s         subscript  η  r     η   subscript  η  s      \eta_{r}=\frac{\eta}{\eta_{s}}   .
