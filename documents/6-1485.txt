Milnor K-theory

In mathematics, Milnor K-theory was an early attempt to define higher algebraic K-theory, introduced by .
Definition
The calculation of K2 of a field F led Milnor to the following ad hoc definition of "higher" K-groups by



thus as graded parts of a quotient of the tensor algebra of the multiplicative group F× by the two-sided ideal, generated by the


 
  for a ≠ 0, 1. For n = 0,1,2 these coincide with Quillen's K-groups of a field, but for n ≧ 3 they differ in general. We define the symbol

 
  as the image of 
 
 
 
 
 : the case n=2 is a Steinberg symbol.1
The tensor product on the tensor algebra induces a product 
 
 
 
  making 
 
 
 
  a graded ring which is graded-commutative.2
Examples
For example, we have 
 
 
 
  for n ≧ 2; 
 
 
 
  is an uncountable uniquely divisible group; 
 
 
 
 
  is the direct sum of a cyclic group of order 2 and an uncountable uniquely divisible group; 
 
 
 
  is the direct sum of the multiplicative group of 
 
 
 
  and an uncountable uniquely divisible group; 
 
 
 
  is the direct sum of the cyclic group of order 2 and cyclic groups of order 
 
 
 
  for all odd prime 
 
 
 
 
 .
Applications
Milnor K-theory plays a fundamental role in higher class field theory, replacing 
 
 
 
  in the one-dimensional class field theory.
Milnor K-theory modulo 2, denoted k*(F) is related to étale (or Galois) cohomology of the field F by the Milnor conjecture, proven by Voevodsky. The analogous statement for odd primes is the Bloch–Kato conjecture, proved by Voevodsky, Rost, and others.
There are homomorphisms from kn(F) to the Witt ring of F by taking the symbol



where the image is a Pfister form of dimension 2n.3 The image can be taken as In/In+1 and the map is surjective since the Pfister forms additively generate In.4 The Milnor conjecture can be interpreted as stating that these maps are isomorphisms.5
