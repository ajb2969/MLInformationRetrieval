   Milnor K-theory      Milnor K-theory   In mathematics , Milnor K-theory was an early attempt to define higher algebraic K-theory , introduced by .  Definition  The calculation of K 2 of a field F led Milnor to the following ad hoc definition of "higher" K -groups by         K  *  M    (  F  )    :=     T  *    F  √ó    /   (   a  ‚äó   (   1  -  a   )    )     ,     assign     subscript   superscript  K  M     F        superscript  T     superscript  F      tensor-product  a    1  a       K^{M}_{*}(F):=T^{*}F^{\times}/(a\otimes(1-a)),\,     thus as graded parts of a quotient of the tensor algebra of the multiplicative group  F √ó by the two-sided ideal , generated by the      a  ‚äó   (   1  -  a   )      tensor-product  a    1  a     a\otimes(1-a)\,   for a ‚â†¬†0,¬†1. For n =¬†0,1,2 these coincide with Quillen's K-groups of a field, but for n ‚âß¬†3 they differ in general. We define the symbol     {   a  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   a  n   }      subscript  a  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  a  n     \{a_{1},\ldots,a_{n}\}   as the image of     a  1   ‚äó  ‚ãØ  ‚äó   a  n      tensor-product   subscript  a  1   normal-‚ãØ   subscript  a  n     a_{1}\otimes\cdots\otimes a_{n}   : the case n =2 is a Steinberg symbol . 1  The tensor product on the tensor algebra induces a product      K  m   √ó   K  n    ‚Üí   K   m  +  n       normal-‚Üí     subscript  K  m    subscript  K  n     subscript  K    m  n      K_{m}\times K_{n}\rightarrow K_{m+n}   making     K  *  M    (  F  )        subscript   superscript  K  M     F    K^{M}_{*}(F)   a graded ring which is graded-commutative . 2  Examples  For example, we have      K  n  M    (   ùîΩ  q   )    =  0         subscript   superscript  K  M   n    subscript  ùîΩ  q    0    K^{M}_{n}(\mathbb{F}_{q})=0   for n ‚âß¬†2;     K  2  M    (  ‚ÑÇ  )        subscript   superscript  K  M   2   ‚ÑÇ    K^{M}_{2}(\mathbb{C})   is an uncountable  uniquely divisible group ;     K  2  M    (  ‚Ñù  )        subscript   superscript  K  M   2   ‚Ñù    K^{M}_{2}(\mathbb{R})   is the direct sum of a cyclic group of order 2 and an uncountable uniquely divisible group;     K  2  M    (   ‚Ñö  p   )        subscript   superscript  K  M   2    subscript  ‚Ñö  p     K^{M}_{2}(\mathbb{Q}_{p})   is the direct sum of the multiplicative group of    ùîΩ  p     subscript  ùîΩ  p    \mathbb{F}_{p}   and an uncountable uniquely divisible group;     K  2  M    (  ‚Ñö  )        subscript   superscript  K  M   2   ‚Ñö    K^{M}_{2}(\mathbb{Q})   is the direct sum of the cyclic group of order 2 and cyclic groups of order    p  -  1      p  1    p-1   for all odd prime   p   p   p   .  Applications  Milnor K-theory plays a fundamental role in higher class field theory, replacing    K  1  M     subscript   superscript  K  M   1    K^{M}_{1}   in the one-dimensional class field theory .  Milnor K-theory modulo 2, denoted k * ( F ) is related to √©tale (or Galois ) cohomology of the field F by the Milnor conjecture , proven by Voevodsky . The analogous statement for odd primes is the Bloch‚ÄìKato conjecture , proved by Voevodsky, Rost , and others.  There are homomorphisms from k n ( F ) to the Witt ring of F by taking the symbol        {   a  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   a  n   }   ‚Ü¶   ‚ü®   ‚ü®   a  1   ,   a  2   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   a  n   ‚ü©   ‚ü©   =    ‚ü®  1  ,   a  1   ‚ü©   ‚äó   ‚ü®  1  ,   a  2   ‚ü©   ‚äó  ‚Ä¶  ‚äó   ‚ü®  1  ,   a  n   ‚ü©     ,       maps-to    subscript  a  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  a  n     delimited-‚ü®‚ü©    subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  a  n           tensor-product   1   subscript  a  1     1   subscript  a  2    normal-‚Ä¶   1   subscript  a  n        \{a_{1},\ldots,a_{n}\}\mapsto\langle\langle a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}\rangle%
 \rangle=\langle 1,a_{1}\rangle\otimes\langle 1,a_{2}\rangle\otimes...\otimes%
 \langle 1,a_{n}\rangle\ ,     where the image is a Pfister form of dimension 2 n . 3 The image can be taken as I n / I n +1 and the map is surjective since the Pfister forms additively generate I n . 4 The Milnor conjecture can be interpreted as stating that these maps are isomorphisms. 5  References       Further reading     "  Category:K-theory      Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.184 ‚Ü©  Lam (2005) p.366 ‚Ü©  Lam (2005) p.316 ‚Ü©
