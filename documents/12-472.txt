Apostolico–Giancarlo algorithm

In computer science, the Apostolico–Giancarlo algorithm is a variant of the Boyer–Moore string search algorithm, the basic application of which is searching for occurrences of a pattern 
 
 
 
  in a text 
 
 
 
 . As with other comparison-based string searches, this is done by aligning 
 
 
 
  to a certain index of 
 
 
 
  and checking whether a match occurs at that index. 
 
 
 
  is then shifted relative to 
 
 
 
  according to the rules of the Boyer-Moore algorithm, and the process repeats until the end of 
 
 
 
  has been reached. Application of the Boyer-Moore shift rules often results in large chunks of the text being skipped entirely.
With regard to the shift operation, Apostolico-Giancarlo is exactly equivalent in functionality to Boyer-Moore. The utility of Apostolico-Giancarlo is to speed up the match-checking operation at any index. With Boyer-Moore, finding an occurrence of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  requires that all 
 
 
 
  characters of 
 
 
 
  be explicitly matched. For certain patterns and texts, this is very inefficient - a simple example is when both pattern and text consist of the same repeated character, in which case Boyer-Moore runs in 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the length in characters of 
 
 
 
 . Apostolico-Giancarlo speeds this up by recording the number of characters matched at the alignments of 
 
 
 
  in a table, which is combined with data gathered during the pre-processing of 
 
 
 
  to avoid redundant equality checking for sequences of characters that are known to match.
