   Concave function      Concave function   In mathematics , a concave function is the negative of a convex function . A concave function is also synonymously called concave downwards , concave down , convex upwards , convex cap or upper convex .  Definition  A real-valued function  f on an interval (or, more generally, a convex set in vector space ) is said to be concave if, for any x and y in the interval and for any t in [0,1],        f   (     (   1  -  t   )   x   +    (  t  )   y    )    ≥     (   1  -  t   )   f   (  x  )    +    (  t  )   f   (  y  )      .        f        1  t   x     t  y           1  t   f  x     t  f  y      f((1-t)x+(t)y)\geq(1-t)f(x)+(t)f(y).     A function is called strictly concave if       f   (     (   1  -  t   )   x   +    (  t  )   y    )    >     (   1  -  t   )   f   (  x  )    +    (  t  )   f   (  y  )           f        1  t   x     t  y           1  t   f  x     t  f  y      f((1-t)x+(t)y)>(1-t)f(x)+(t)f(y)\,   for any t in (0,1) and x ≠ y .  For a function f : R → R , this definition merely states that for every z between x and y , the point ( z , f ( z ) ) on the graph of f is above the straight line joining the points ( x , f ( x ) ) and ( y , f ( y ) ).  (Figure)  ConcaveDef.png   A function f(x) is quasiconcave if the upper contour sets of the function     S   (  a  )    =   {  x  :    f   (  x  )    ≥  a   }         S  a    conditional-set  x      f  x   a      S(a)=\{x:f(x)\geq a\}   are convex sets.  Properties  A function f ( x ) is concave over a convex set if and only if the function − f ( x ) is a convex function over the set.  A differentiable  function  f is concave on an interval if its derivative function f ′ is monotonically decreasing on that interval: a concave function has a decreasing slope . ("Decreasing" here means non-increasing, rather than strictly decreasing, and thus allows zero slopes.)  For a twice-differentiable function f , if the second derivative , f ′′(x) , is positive (or, if the acceleration is positive), then the graph is convex; if f ′′(x) is negative, then the graph is concave. Points where concavity changes are inflection points .  If a convex (i.e., concave upward) function has a "bottom", any point at the bottom is a minimal extremum . If a concave (i.e., concave downward) function has an "apex", any point at the apex is a maximal extremum .  If f ( x ) is twice- differentiable , then f ( x ) is concave if and only if  f ′′( x ) is non-positive . If its second derivative is negative then it is strictly concave, but the opposite is not true, as shown by f ( x ) = - x 4 .  If f is concave and differentiable, then it is bounded above by its first-order Taylor approximation :       f   (  y  )    ≤    f   (  x  )    +    f  ′    (  x  )    [   y  -  x   ]           f  y       f  x      superscript  f  normal-′   x   delimited-[]    y  x        f(y)\leq f(x)+f^{\prime}(x)[y-x]     A continuous function on C is concave if and only if for any x and y in C       f   (    x  +  y   2   )    ≥     f   (  x  )    +   f   (  y  )     2         f      x  y   2          f  x     f  y    2     f\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)\geq\frac{f(x)+f(y)}{2}     If a function f is concave, and f (0) ≥ 0, then f is subadditive . Proof:   since f is concave, let y = 0,     f   (   t  x   )    =   f   (    t  x   +    (   1  -  t   )   ⋅  0    )    ≥    t  f   (  x  )    +    (   1  -  t   )   f   (  0  )     ≥   t  f   (  x  )            f    t  x      f      t  x    normal-⋅    1  t   0              t  f  x       1  t   f  0           t  f  x      f(tx)=f(tx+(1-t)\cdot 0)\geq tf(x)+(1-t)f(0)\geq tf(x)     f(a) + f(b) = f \left((a+b) \frac{a}{a+b} \right) + f \left((a+b) \frac{b}{a+b} \right)   \ge \frac{a}{a+b} f(a+b) + \frac{b}{a+b} f(a+b) = f(a+b)  Examples   The functions     f   (  x  )    =   -   x  2          f  x      superscript  x  2      f(x)=-x^{2}   and     g   (  x  )    =   x         g  x     x     g(x)=\sqrt{x}   are concave on their domains, as their second derivatives      f  ′′    (  x  )    =   -  2          superscript  f  ′′   x     2     f^{\prime\prime}(x)=-2   and      g  ′′    (  x  )    =   -   1   4   x  1.5             superscript  g  ′′   x       1    4   superscript  x  1.5        g^{\prime\prime}(x)=-\frac{1}{4x^{1.5}}   are always negative.  Any affine function      f   (  x  )    =    a  x   +  b         f  x       a  x   b     f(x)=ax+b   is both (non-strictly) concave and convex.  The sine function is concave on the interval    [  0  ,  π  ]     0  π    [0,\pi]   .  The function     f   (  B  )    =   log   |  B  |          f  B       B      f(B)=\log|B|   , where    |  B  |      B    |B|   is the determinant of a nonnegative-definite matrix  B , is concave. 1  Practical example: rays bending in computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere .
