Gauss's principle of least constraint

The principle of least constraint is another formulation of classical mechanics enunciated by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1829.
The principle of least constraint is a least squares principle stating that the true motion of a mechanical system of 
 
 
 
  masses is the minimum of the quantity



for all trajectories satisfying any imposed constraints, where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  represent the mass, position and applied forces of the 
 
 
 
  mass.
Gauss's principle is equivalent to D'Alembert's principle.
The principle of least constraint is qualitatively similar to Hamilton's principle, which states that the true path taken by a mechanical system is an extremum of the action. However, Gauss's principle is a true (local) minimal principle, whereas the other is an extremal principle.
Hertz's principle of least curvature
Hertz's principle of least curvature is a special case of Gauss's principle, restricted by the two conditions that there be no applied forces and that all masses are identical. (Without loss of generality, the masses may be set equal to one.) Under these conditions, Gauss's minimized quantity can be written



The kinetic energy 
 
 
 
  is also conserved under these conditions



Since the line element 
 
 
 
  in the 
 
 
 
 -dimensional space of the coordinates is defined



the conservation of energy may also be written



Dividing 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  yields another minimal quantity



Since 
 
 
 
  is the local curvature of the trajectory in the 
 
 
 
 -dimensional space of the coordinates, minimization of 
 
 
 
  is equivalent to finding the trajectory of least curvature (a geodesic) that is consistent with the constraints. Hertz's principle is also a special case of Jacobi's formulation of the least-action principle.
