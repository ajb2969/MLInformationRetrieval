   Gauss's principle of least constraint      Gauss's principle of least constraint   The principle of least constraint is another formulation of classical mechanics enunciated by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1829.  The principle of least constraint is a least squares principle stating that the true motion of a mechanical system of   N   N   N   masses is the minimum of the quantity       Z     =  def      ∑   k  =  1   N     m  k     |      d  2    𝐫  k     d   t  2     -    𝐅  k    m  k     |   2         superscript   def   Z    superscript   subscript     k  1    N      subscript  m  k    superscript           superscript  d  2    subscript  𝐫  k      d   superscript  t  2        subscript  𝐅  k    subscript  m  k      2       Z\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \sum_{k=1}^{N}m_{k}\left|\frac{d^{2}\mathbf{r}_%
 {k}}{dt^{2}}-\frac{\mathbf{F}_{k}}{m_{k}}\right|^{2}     for all trajectories satisfying any imposed constraints, where    m  k     subscript  m  k    m_{k}   ,    𝐫  k     subscript  𝐫  k    \mathbf{r}_{k}   and    𝐅  k     subscript  𝐅  k    \mathbf{F}_{k}   represent the mass, position and applied forces of the    k  th     superscript  normal-k  th    \mathrm{k^{th}}   mass.  Gauss's principle is equivalent to D'Alembert's principle .  The principle of least constraint is qualitatively similar to Hamilton's principle , which states that the true path taken by a mechanical system is an extremum of the action . However, Gauss's principle is a true (local) minimal principle, whereas the other is an extremal principle.  Hertz's principle of least curvature  Hertz's principle of least curvature is a special case of Gauss's principle, restricted by the two conditions that there be no applied forces and that all masses are identical. (Without loss of generality, the masses may be set equal to one.) Under these conditions, Gauss's minimized quantity can be written      Z  =    ∑   k  =  1   N     |     d  2    𝐫  k     d   t  2     |   2        Z    superscript   subscript     k  1    N    superscript         superscript  d  2    subscript  𝐫  k      d   superscript  t  2      2      Z=\sum_{k=1}^{N}\left|\frac{d^{2}\mathbf{r}_{k}}{dt^{2}}\right|^{2}     The kinetic energy   T   T   T   is also conserved under these conditions       T     =  def      1  2     ∑   k  =  1   N     |    d   𝐫  k     d  t    |   2         superscript   def   T      1  2     superscript   subscript     k  1    N    superscript        d   subscript  𝐫  k      d  t     2       T\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{N}\left|\frac{d\mathbf{r%
 }_{k}}{dt}\right|^{2}     Since the line element    d   s  2       d   superscript  s  2     ds^{2}   in the    3  N      3  N    3N   -dimensional space of the coordinates is defined       d    s  2       =  def      ∑   k  =  1   N     |   d   𝐫  k    |   2        superscript   def     d   superscript  s  2      superscript   subscript     k  1    N    superscript      d   subscript  𝐫  k     2      ds^{2}\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \sum_{k=1}^{N}\left|d\mathbf{r}_{k}\right|%
 ^{2}     the conservation of energy may also be written        (    d  s    d  t    )   2   =   2  T        superscript      d  s     d  t    2     2  T     \left(\frac{ds}{dt}\right)^{2}=2T     Dividing   Z   Z   Z   by    2  T      2  T    2T   yields another minimal quantity       K     =  def      ∑   k  =  1   N     |     d  2    𝐫  k     d   s  2     |   2        superscript   def   K    superscript   subscript     k  1    N    superscript         superscript  d  2    subscript  𝐫  k      d   superscript  s  2      2      K\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \sum_{k=1}^{N}\left|\frac{d^{2}\mathbf{r}_{k}}{%
 ds^{2}}\right|^{2}     Since    K      K    \sqrt{K}   is the local curvature of the trajectory in the    3  N      3  N    3N   -dimensional space of the coordinates, minimization of   K   K   K   is equivalent to finding the trajectory of least curvature (a geodesic ) that is consistent with the constraints. Hertz's principle is also a special case of Jacobi 's formulation of the least-action principle .
