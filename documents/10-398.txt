   Methomyl      Methomyl   Methomyl is a carbamate  insecticide introduced in 1966. It is highly toxic to humans. 1 The EU and UK imposed a pesticide residue limit of 0.02 mg/kg for apples and oranges.  Methomyl is the active ingredient in commercial fly bait granules which are mixed with a cola drink to kill bothersome raccoon , skunk and opossum . Using methomyl in this "off-label" way may be against the law in some of the United States. 2 3  Use  Methomyl is an insecticide used against Lepidopterous  insect pests , and suppresses Coleopterous and some Hemipterous insect pests. It is also used as an ovicide against cotton bollworms and budworms . 4 Methomyl is registered for commercial/professional use on on a wide variety of agricultural sites including field, vegetable, and orchard crops; turf ( sod farms only); and livestock quarters. Its use is also allowed on commercial premises and refuse containers. It is not registered for homeowner or nonprofessional application. 5  Trade names  Common names for methomyl include metomil and mesomile. Trade names include Acinate, Agrinate, DuPont 1179, Flytek, Kipsin, Lannate, Lanox, Memilene, Methavin, Methomex, Nudrin, NuBait, Pillarmate and SD 14999 6  Toxicity  In acute toxicity testing, methomyl is placed in EPA  Toxicity Category I (the highest toxicity category out of four) via the oral route and in eye irritation studies. 7 It is in lower Toxicity Categories for inhalation (Category II), acute dermal effects (Category III), and acute skin irritation (Category IV). Methomyl is not likely to be a carcinogen (EPA carcinogen Category E). 8  Ecotoxicity  Methomyl has low persistence in the soil environment, with a reported half-life of approximately 14 days. 9 Because of its high solubility in water, and low affinity for soil binding methomyl may have potential for groundwater contamination. 10 11 The estimated aqueous  half-life for the insecticide is 6 days in surface water and over 25 weeks in groundwater . 12  Synthesis  Methomyl can be produced by reaction of methyl isocyanate and methylthioacetaldoxime (also known as methomyl oxime).
