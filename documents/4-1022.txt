   Slug (mass)      Slug (mass)   The slug is a unit of mass associated with Imperial units and United States customary units . It is a mass that accelerates by 1 ft/s 2 when a force of one pound () is exerted on it.         1   slug   =     1      lb  F   ⋅   s  2    ft    ⟺       1    lb  F    =    1     slug  ⋅  ft    s  2         formulae-sequence      1  slug      1     normal-⋅   subscript  lb  F    superscript  s  2    ft    normal-⟺        1   subscript  lb  F      1     normal-⋅  slug  ft    superscript  s  2        1\,\text{slug}=1\,\frac{\text{lb}_{F}\cdot\text{s}^{2}}{\text{ft}}\qquad%

 {\text{s}^{2}}     One slug has a mass of  or  based on standard gravity , the international foot , and the avoirdupois pound . 1 At the surface of the Earth, an object with a mass of 1 slug exerts a force of approximately  or . 2 3  History  The slug is part of a subset of units known as the gravitational FPS system , one of several such specialized systems of mechanical units developed in the late 19th and the 20th century. Geepound was another name for this unit in early literature. 4  The name "slug" was coined before 1900 by British physicist Arthur Mason Worthington , 5 but it did not see any significant use until decades later. A 1928 textbook says:   The slug is listed in the "Regulations under the Weights and Measures (National Standards) Act, 1960". This regulation defines the units of weights and measures, both regular and metric, in Australia.  Similar units  The blob is the inch version of the slug (1 blob = 1 lb f ·s 2 /in = 12 slugs) 6 or equivalent to 175.126 kg. This unit is also called slinch (a portmanteau of the words slug and inch). 7 8 Similar terms include slugette , 9 and a snail . 10  Similar metric units include the "glug" in the centimetre-gram-second system , and the "mug", "par", or "MTE" in the metre-kilogram-second system . 11  References  External links   "What is a Slug?" on phy-astr.gsu.edu   "  Category:Imperial units  Category:Units of mass     Shigley, Joseph E. and Mischke, Charles R.
