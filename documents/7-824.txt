Compact quantum group

In mathematics, a compact quantum group is an abstract structure on a unital separable C*-algebra axiomatized from those that exist on the commutative C*-algebra of "continuous complex-valued functions" on a compact quantum group.
The basic motivation for this theory comes from the following analogy. The space of complex-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff topological space forms a commutative C*-algebra. On the other hand, by the Gelfand Theorem, a commutative C*-algebra is isomorphic to the C*-algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff topological space, and the topological space is uniquely determined by the C*-algebra up to homeomorphism.
S. L. Woronowicz 1 introduced the important concept of compact matrix quantum groups, which he initially called compact pseudogroups. Compact matrix quantum groups are abstract structures on which the "continuous functions" on the structure are given by elements of a C*-algebra. The geometry of a compact matrix quantum group is a special case of a noncommutative geometry.
Formulation
For a compact topological group, 
 
 
 
 , there exists a C*-algebra homomorphism



where 
 
 
 
  is the minimal C*-algebra tensor product — the completion of the algebraic tensor product of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ) — such that



for all 
 
 
 
 , and for all 
 
 
 
 , where



for all 
 
 
 
  and all 
 
 
 
 . There also exists a linear multiplicative mapping


 
 ,
such that



for all 
 
 
 
  and all 
 
 
 
 . Strictly speaking, this does not make 
 
 
 
  into a Hopf algebra, unless 
 
 
 
  is finite.
On the other hand, a finite-dimensional representation of 
 
 
 
  can be used to generate a *-subalgebra of 
 
 
 
  which is also a Hopf *-algebra. Specifically, if



is an 
 
 
 
 -dimensional representation of 
 
 
 
 , then



for all 
 
 
 
 , and



for all 
 
 
 
 . It follows that the *-algebra generated by 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  is a Hopf *-algebra: the counit is determined by



for all 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
  is the Kronecker delta), the antipode is 
 
 
 
 , and the unit is given by



Compact Matrix Quantum Groups
As a generalization, a compact matrix quantum group is defined as a pair 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a C*-algebra and



is a matrix with entries in 
 
 
 
  such that

The *-subalgebra, , of 
 
 
 
 , which is generated by the matrix elements of 
 
 
 
 , is dense in 
 
 
 
 ;


There exists a C*-algebra homomorphism, called the comultiplication, 
 
 
 
  (here 
 
 
 
  is the C*-algebra tensor product - the completion of the algebraic tensor product of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ) such that










There exists a linear antimultiplicative map, called the coinverse,  such that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the identity element of 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  is antimultiplicative, 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .

As a consequence of continuity, the comultiplication on 
 
 
 
  is coassociative.
In general, 
 
 
 
  is a bialgebra, and  is a Hopf *-algebra.
Informally, 
 
 
 
  can be regarded as the *-algebra of continuous complex-valued functions over the compact matrix quantum group, and 
 
 
 
  can be regarded as a finite-dimensional representation of the compact matrix quantum group.
Compact Quantum Groups
For C*-algebras 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  acting on the Hilbert spaces 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively, their minimal tensor product is defined to be the norm completion of the algebraic tensor product 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 ; the norm completion is also denoted by 
 
 
 
 .
A compact quantum group23 is defined as a pair 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a unital separable C*-algebra and



 
  is a C*-algebra unital homomorphism satisfying 
 
 
 
 ;
the sets  and  are dense in 
 
 
 
 .

Representations
A representation of the compact matrix quantum group is given by a corepresentation of the Hopf *-algebraa corepresentation of a counital coassiative coalgebra

with entries in 
 
 
 
  (so that 
 
 
 
 ) such that





 
  Furthermore, a representation, v, is called unitary if the matrix for v is unitary, or equivalently, if
