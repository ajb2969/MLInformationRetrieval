   Cartan's lemma (potential theory)      Cartan's lemma (potential theory)   In potential theory , a branch of mathematics , Cartan's lemma , named after Henri Cartan , is a bound on the measure and complexity of the set on which a logarithmic Newtonian potential is small.  Statement of the lemma  The following statement can be found in Levin's book. 1  Let μ be a finite positive Borel measure on the complex plane C with μ ( C ) = n . Let u ( z ) be the logarithmic potential of μ :       u   (  z  )    =    1   2  π      ∫  𝐂     log    |   z  -  ζ   |   d  μ     (  ζ  )            u  z       1    2  π      subscript   𝐂             z  ζ    d  μ    ζ       u(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\mathbf{C}}\log|z-\zeta|\,d\mu(\zeta)     Given H ∈ (0, 1), there exist discs of radius r i such that        ∑  i    r  i    <   5   H          subscript   i    subscript  r  i      5  H     \sum_{i}r_{i}<5H\,     and       u   (  z  )    ≥    n   2  π     log   H  e           u  z       n    2  π        H  e       u(z)\geq\frac{n}{2\pi}\log\frac{H}{e}     for all z outside the union of these discs.
