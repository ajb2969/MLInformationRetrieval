   Monoidal monad      Monoidal monad   In category theory , a monoidal monad     (  T  ,  η  ,  μ  ,  m  )     T  η  μ  m    (T,\eta,\mu,m)   is a monad     (  T  ,  η  ,  μ  )     T  η  μ    (T,\eta,\mu)   on a monoidal category     (  C  ,  ⊗  ,  I  )     C  tensor-product  I    (C,\otimes,I)   such that the functor      T  :    (  C  ,  ⊗  ,  I  )   →   (  C  ,  ⊗  ,  I  )       normal-:  T   normal-→   C  tensor-product  I    C  tensor-product  I      T:(C,\otimes,I)\to(C,\otimes,I)     is a lax monoidal functor and the natural transformations    η  ,  μ     η  μ    \eta,\mu   are monoidal natural transformations . In other words,   T   T   T   is equipped with coherence maps       m   A  ,  B    :      T  A   ⊗  T   B   →   T   (   A  ⊗  B   )        normal-:   subscript  m   A  B     normal-→     tensor-product    T  A   T   B     T   tensor-product  A  B       m_{A,B}:TA\otimes TB\to T(A\otimes B)     and      m  :   I  →   T  I       normal-:  m   normal-→  I    T  I      m:I\to TI     satisfying certain properties , and its structure maps      η  :    i  d   ⇒  T      normal-:  η   normal-⇒    i  d   T     \eta:id\Rightarrow T     and      μ  :    T  2   ⇒  T      normal-:  μ   normal-⇒   superscript  T  2   T     \mu:T^{2}\Rightarrow T     must be monoidal with respect to    (  C  ,  ⊗  ,  I  )     C  tensor-product  I    (C,\otimes,I)   . By monoidality of   η   η   \eta   , the morphisms   m   m   m   and    η  I     subscript  η  I    \eta_{I}   are necessarily equal.  This is equivalent to saying that a monoidal monad is a monad in the 2-category MonCat of monoidal categories, monoidal functors, and monoidal natural transformations.  Hopf monads and bimonads  Ieke Moerdijk introduced the notion of a Hopf monad , 1 which is an opmonoidal monad, that is, a monad with coherence morphisms     m   A  ,  B    :    T   (   A  ⊗  B   )    →     T  A   ⊗  T   B       normal-:   superscript  m   A  B     normal-→    T   tensor-product  A  B       tensor-product    T  A   T   B      m^{A,B}:T(A\otimes B)\to TA\otimes TB   and     m  0   :    T  I   →  I      normal-:   superscript  m  0    normal-→    T  I   I     m^{0}:TI\to I   and opmonoidal natural transformations as multiplication and left/right units.  An easy example for the category   Vect   Vect   \operatorname{Vect}   of vector spaces is the monad    -  ⊗  A     fragments   tensor-product  A    -\otimes A   , where   A   A   A   is a bialgebra . 2 The multiplication in   A   A   A   then defines the multiplication of the monad, while the comultiplication gives rise to the opmonoidal structure. The algebras of this monad are just right   A   A   A   -modules.  In works of Bruguières and Virelizier, this concept has been renamed bimonad , 3 by analogy to " bialgebra ". They reserve the term "Hopf monad" for bimonads with an antipode, in analogy to " Hopf algebras ".  Properties   The Kleisli category of a monoidal monad has a canonical monoidal structure, induced by the monoidal structure of the monad. The canonical adjunction between   C   C   C   and the Kleisli category is a monoidal adjunction with respect to this monoidal structure.  The Eilenberg-Moore category (the category of algebras) of a Hopf monad (in Moerdijk's nomenclature) has a canonical monoidal structure. 4   Examples  The following monads on the category of sets, with its cartesian monoidal structure, are monoidal monads:   The power set monad.  The probability distributions (Giry) monad.   The following monads on the category of sets, with its cartesian monoidal structure, are not monoidal monads   If   M   M   M   is a monoid, then    X  ↦   X  ×  M      maps-to  X    X  M     X\mapsto X\times M   is a monad, but in general there is no reason to expect a monoidal structure on it (unless   M   M   M   is commutative).
