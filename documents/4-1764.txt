   Pentagonal cupola      Pentagonal cupola   In geometry , the pentagonal cupola is one of the Johnson solids ( J 5 ). It can be obtained as a slice of the rhombicosidodecahedron . The pentagonal cupola consists of 5 equilateral triangles , 5 squares , 1 pentagon , and 1 decagon .  Formulae  The following formulae for volume , surface area and circumradius can be used if all faces are regular , with edge length a : 1     V  =    (    1  6    (   5  +   4   5     )    )    a  3    ≈   2.32405...   a  3          V        1  6     5    4    5       superscript  a  3           2.32405...   superscript  a  3       V=\left(\frac{1}{6}\left(5+4\sqrt{5}\right)\right)a^{3}\approx 2.32405...a^{3}       A  =    (    1  4    (   20  +   5   3    +    5   (   145  +   62   5     )      )    )    a  2    =    (    1  4    (   20  +    10   (   80  +   31   5    +    15   (   145  +   62   5     )      )      )    )    a  2    ≈   16.5797...   a  2          A        1  4     20    5    3        5    145    62    5          superscript  a  2               1  4     20      10    80    31    5        15    145    62    5             superscript  a  2           16.5797...   superscript  a  2       A=\left(\frac{1}{4}\left(20+5\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{5(145+62\sqrt{5})}\right)\right)a^%

It can be obtained as a slice of the nonconvex great rhombicosidodecahedron or quasirhombicosidodecahedron, analogously to how the pentagonal cupola may be obtained as a slice of the rhombicosidodecahedron. As in all cupolae, the base polygon has twice as many edges and vertices as the top; in this case the base polygon is a decagram .  It may be seen as a cupola with a retrograde pentagrammic base, so that the squares and triangles connect across the bases in the opposite way to the pentagrammic cuploid , hence intersecting each other more deeply.
