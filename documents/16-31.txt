   Alpha-bisabolene synthase      Alpha-bisabolene synthase   Alpha-bisabolene synthase (, bisabolene synthase ) is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase ((E)-alpha-bisabolene-forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (E)-alpha-bisabolene + diphosphate    This synthase requires a divalent cation cofactor (Mg 2+ or, to a lesser extent, Mn 2+ ) to neutralize the negative charge of the diphosphate leaving group.
