Cortisol sulfotransferase




Cortisol sulfotransferase

In enzymology, a cortisol sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + cortisol 
 
 
 
  adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + cortisol 21-sulfate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and cortisol, whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and cortisol 21-sulfate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:cortisol 21-sulfotransferase. Other names in common use include glucocorticosteroid sulfotransferase, and glucocorticoid sulfotransferase.
