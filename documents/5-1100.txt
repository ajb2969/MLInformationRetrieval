   Bottomness      Bottomness   In physics , bottomness (symbol B ′) also called beauty , is a flavour quantum number reflecting the difference between the number of bottom antiquarks ( n ) and the number of bottom quarks ( n ) that are present in a particle:       B  ′   =   -   (    n  b   -   n   b  ¯     )         superscript  B  normal-′        subscript  n  b    subscript  n   normal-¯  b        B^{\prime}=-(n_{b}-n_{\bar{b}})     Bottom quarks have (by convention) a bottomness of −1 while bottom antiquarks have a bottomness of +1. The convention is that the flavour quantum number sign for the quark is the same as the sign of the electric charge (symbol Q ) of that quark (in this case, Q = −    1  /  3      1  3    {1}/{3}   ).  As with other flavour-related quantum numbers, bottomness is preserved under strong and electromagnetic interactions , but not under weak interactions . For first-order weak reactions, it holds that     Δ   B  ′    =    \plusmn   1         normal-Δ   superscript  B  normal-′      \plusmn  1     \Delta B^{\prime}=\plusmn 1   .  This term is rarely used. Most physicists simply refer to "the number of bottom quarks" and "the number of bottom antiquarks".
