   Finnish verb conjugation      Finnish verb conjugation   Verbs in the Finnish language can be divided into six main groups depending on the stem type, both for formal analysis and for teaching the language to non-native speakers. All six types have the same set of personal endings, but the stems assume different suffixes and undergo (slightly) different changes when inflected.  Please refer to the article on Finnish language grammar for more about verbs and other aspects of Finnish grammar.  Tables of conjugation  Tables of conjugation are given here for the regular verb (of type I,) puhua , to speak, as used in the formal, written language. Verb conjugation in the everyday spoken language is somewhat different.  Basic tenses in the indicative mood      indicative mood      active voice  present tense    per.  no.    1st  sg.    2nd  sinä    3rd  hän    1st  pl.    2nd  te    3rd  he    passive voice  puhutaan     The present, imperfect, perfect, and pluperfect correspond fairly well to English: "speaks", "spoke", "has spoken", and "had spoken", resp., or in the passive voice, "it is spoken", "it was spoken", "it has been spoken", and "it had been spoken". Note the auxiliary verb ei used for negation, usually with the naked stem of the main verb, but with the past participle in the negative imperfect. Finnish lacks a true future tense, so normally the present tense must suffice for future time as well.  Conditional and potential mood      conditional mood  potential mood      active voice  present tense  perfect    per.  no.  pron.    1st  sg.  minä    2nd  sinä  puhuisit    3rd  hän  puhuisi    1st  pl.  me    2nd  te  puhuisitte    3rd  he  puhuisivat    passive voice  puhuttaisiin  ei puhuttaisi     The conditional mood corresponds mostly to "would" or "should" or to the past subjunctive in English. (Finnish lacks a subjunctive mood.) The potential mood is rather rare, and corresponds to "may" or "might" in English. The perfect forms of these moods are easily understood as "would have", "should have", "might have", etc.  Imperative mood and miscellaneous tenses      imperative mood  indicative mood      active voice  present tense  perfect    per.  no.  pron.    1st  sg.  minä    2nd  sinä  puhu    3rd  hän  puhukoon    1st  pl.  me    2nd  te  puhukaa    3rd  he  puhukoot    passive voice  puhuttakoon  ei puhuttako — älköön puhuttako     The first and third person imperative forms here correspond to English "let us speak", "let him not speak", "let it not be spoken", etc. The perfect imperative is still valid, if somewhat awkward and contrived, e.g. as in English "let it (not) have been spoken". The first person plural imperative puhukaamme sounds rather formal and archaic, so in everyday speech, the passive present indicative puhutaan , is used instead, although this may not quite be considered correct. There are many variations of the imperative forms: in old writings, one may also see the forms puhukaat or puhukaatte for the second person plural, puhukaan for the third person plural, or puhuttakaan for the passive. In the passive or third person, the imperative is sometimes used for the present or perfect subjunctive of other languages, a mood which is lacking in Finnish.  The present prospective and the imperfect prospective correspond best to "I am to speak" and "I was to speak" in English. It is not correct Finnish to use these tenses in the plural: the plural form of the present participle, puhuvat , would be confusing if used in this sense, as it resembles too closely the third person plural present indicative. Despite the apparently equivalent use of the present participle, the grammatical aspect of these tenses is prospective rather than continuous or progressive as in English.  Verbs of obligation in the agent construction  Verbs of obligation such as täytyä , tarvita , pitää , and tulla , with the meanings "must", "need to", "ought to", "shall", respectively are often used in the agent form of construction in which the verb is not conjugated for person but is in the impersonal third person singular. In this construction   the person(s) bearing the obligation is regarded as the 'agent' (not the subject) and is in the genitive case  the verb of obligation is in the impersonal third person singular regardless of the plurality and person of the agent.  This is followed by another verb or verb phrase in which the verb is in the short from first infinitive (i.e. the dictionary form) and which is then regarded as the sentence's subject. 1    Heidä n täyty y puhua minun kanssani = They must speak with me ;  Minun täytyy puhua heidän kanssansa = I must speak with them ;  Sinun ei tarvitse tehdä tuota = you don't need to do that ;  Ei sinun pidä tappaman = thou shalt not kill . 2   sinun pitäisi tulla huomenna = you should come tomorrow .   There is no equivalent of this type of construction in English.  The verb täytyä can only be used in this construction and therefore has no other personal forms. The other verbs can carry personal endings in other forms of construction with normal subject, verb, and object in which the obligation is less strong or in which the verb takes on a different meaning altogether.   (Minä) tarvitsen apua I need help —expressing need without obligation  (Minä) pidän hänestä I like him/her —verb has a different meaning   Infinitives and participles  In Finnish there are five infinitive forms, 3 and past and present participles for both active and passive voices. 4  Infinitive I  First infinitive is the dictionary form of the verb, e.g., puhu-a = "to speak" (stem puhu ), and it corresponds in meaning and function to the English infinitive introduced by the particle "to". The suffix of the first infinitive depends on the type of the verb stem. With so-called "vowel" stems, (see verbs of Type I, below), the first infinitive suffix is -a / -ä , whereas with "consonantal" stems, (e.g., Types IV-VI), the suffix is most often -ta / -tä . With vowel stems that consist of a single open syllable ending in a long vowel or a diphthong , or longer stems that end in such syllables, (Type II), the infinitive suffix is -da / -dä , e.g., saa-da = "to get", syö-dä = "to eat", reagoi-da = "to react". The first infinitive of consonantal stems always has the weak consonant grade in the stem, e.g., ka r ata = "to flee" \quad nt → nn , $\quad$  rt → rr , $\quad$  st → st .   anne ttu = (that has been) given; anne tut = "(that have been) given", (pl.);  pur tu "(one that has been) bitten", graded as pur ru- , e.g. pur run "of that which has been bitten".  pes ty = "(that has been) washed", unchanged in soft grade, e.g. pes tyt hiukset = "hair that has been washed" (pl. of hius , "a single hair").   Derived passive forms  Without exception, all other passive forms of the verb may be derived from the passive past participle in a regular manner, by replacing the final -u/y with the following endings:   in the hard grade:  '-iin': passive imperfect; annettiin "was given"  '-ava': : passive present participle; annettava "that which is (to be) given"  '-aisiin/äisiin': passive conditional; annettaisiin "would be given"  '-aisi/äisi': passive conditional connegative with negative verb  ei ; ei annettaisi "would not be given"  '-aneen/äneen': passive potential; annettaneen "might be given"  '-ane/äne': passive potential connegative; ei annettane "might not be given"  '-akoon/äköön', '-akaan/äkään': passive imperative; annettakoon "shall be given"  '-ako/äkö': passive imperative connegative; ei annettako "shall not be given"   in the soft grade:  '-aan/ään': passive present indicative; annetaan "is given"  '-a/ä': passive present indicative connegative with negative verb ei ; ei anneta "is not given".    Overview of main verb types  The following table shows the basic changes and marks for conjugating each of the types of Finnish verbs.     Type  Example  1. Pers. Pres.  3. Pers. Imp.

This group contains a very large number of verbs. Here is how tietää conjugates in the present indicative:   minä tiedä n = I know  sinä tiedä t = you (singular) know  hän/se tiet ää = (s)he/it knows  me tiedä mme = we know  te tiedä tte = you (plural/formal) know  he/ne tietä vät = they know   The personal endings are -n , -t , -(doubled final vowel) , -mme , -tte , -vat . The inflecting stem is formed by dropping the final -a/ä of the infinitive, and has a strong-grade consonant in the third-person forms and weak-grade elsewhere. Note that for third person plural, this is an exception to the general rule for strong grade.  Past Tense  In the simple case (which applies to most type I verbs), the imperfect indicative is formed by inserting the characteristic marker i between the stem and the personal endings, which are the same as in the present tense except that the vowel does not double in the 3rd person singular:   puhu n = "I speak", puhu in = 'I spoke'  puhu t = "you speak", puhu it = 'you spoke'  puhu u = "(he) speaks", puhu i = '(he) spoke'  puhu mme = "we speak", puhu imme = 'we spoke' and so on.   However, the insertion of the i often has an effect on the stem. Of type I verbs, one notable exception is tietää :   tiedän = 'I know', tiesin = 'I knew'   ymmärtää = 'to understand' also follows this pattern. Changes of stem for other verb types will be discussed in the relevant sections below.  Passive   Present passive: The present passive is formed by adding -taan to the inflecting stem of the verb with the consonant in its weak form:  puhua $\rightarrow$ puhu- $\rightarrow$ puhutaan  If the vowel at the end of the stem is a or ä it is changed to e before the -taan ending:  tietää $\rightarrow$ tiedä- $\rightarrow$ tiede $\rightarrow$ tiedetään    Past passive: This is formed in the same way as the present passive, except that the ending is -ttiin , hence puhuttiin = 'it was spoken', tiedettiin = 'it was known'.  Note the presence of the same i marker in the past passive as in the imperfect indicative. Note also the presence of the extra t .    Conditional passive: This is formed in the same way as the present passive, except that the ending is -ttaisiin , hence puhuttaisiin = 'it would be spoken', tiedettäisiin = 'it would be known'.  Note the presence of the isi conditional marker.    Potential passive: This is formed in the same way as the present passive, except that the ending is -ttaneen , hence puhuttaneen = 'it may be spoken', tiedettäneen = 'it may be known'.  Note the presence of the ne potential marker.   Type II verbs  Verbs whose first infinitive ends in vowel + da , for example juoda = 'to drink', syödä = 'to eat'. This is a fairly large group of verbs, partly because one way in which foreign borrowings are incorporated into the Finnish verb paradigms is to add oida , for example, organisoida = 'to organise'.  Another important verb of this type is voida = 'to be able/allowed to'.  The stem is formed by removing da with no vowel doubling in the third person singular: juon, juot, juo, juomme, juotte, juovat.  Imperfect indicative  For these verbs whose stems end in two vowels, the first of the vowels is lost when the i is added in the imperfect: ''juon = 'I drink', join = 'I drank' etc.  There is an exception to this rule if the stem already ends in an i - for example voida or the -oida verbs mentioned earlier. In this case the stem does not change between present and imperfect indicative, so the imperfect forms are the same as the present forms, and the distinction between them must be made from context.  Passive  Passives in this group are formed in the same way as for group II verbs:   syödä $\rightarrow$ syödään, syötiin, syötäisiin  juoda $\rightarrow$ juodaan, juotiin, juotaisiin   Type III verbs  These are verbs whose first infinitive ends in two consonants + a , for example mennä = 'to go'. Another way of looking at these verbs is that they have verb stems ending in a consonant to which a vowel must be added (either e for the present tense or i for the past tense) before the personal ending. The final consonant of the stem is generally emphasised by length of pronunciation in the infinitive and participle forms and orthographically written as a double consonant. Where the consonant ending of the stem is -s, however, the dictionary form of the verb ends with -stä or -sta. This is another large group of verbs.  Present indicative  The stem is formed by removing the a and its preceding consonant. Then add e followed by the personal endings: menen, menet, menee, menemme, menette, menevät.  Imperfect indicative  The i of the imperfect is added directly to the stem formed as for the present tense, then the personal endings are added: pestä = 'to clean', pesen = 'I clean', pesin = 'I cleaned' etc.  Passive   Present passive: In this group, the passive has the same -aan ending as for group I verbs, but no t ; the easiest way to form the passive is to extend the vowel on the end of the first infinitive and then add n :    mennä $\rightarrow$ mennään   All other forms of the passive are related to the present passive in the same way as for type I verbs, including the 'extra t', except that since there was no t to start with, the passive forms only have one! Also the double consonant before the ending becomes single.   mennä $\rightarrow$ mennään $\rightarrow$ mentiin, mentäisiin  olla $\rightarrow$ ollaan $\rightarrow$ oltiin (see below), oltaisiin   Type IV verbs  This, and the following two groups, have the first infinitive that ends in a vowel + ta/tä . Most commonly, type IV verbs end with ata/ätä , ota/ötä , uta/ytä , but other vowels are possible. Examples are tavata = "to meet", pilkata = "to mock", vastata = "to answer", haluta = "to want", tarjota = "to offer".  The stem used in present indicative conjucation is formed by dropping the -ta/-tä suffix from the infinitive form and adding a/ä . In conjugation, the normal personal ending is added; the final vowel is doubled in the 3rd person singular, unless the stem already ends in aa/ää :   halua-n, halua-t, halua-a, halua-mme, halua-tte, halua-vat   tapaa-n, tapaat, tapaa, tapaa-mme , etc.  pilkkaa-n, pilkkaa-t, pilkkaa, pilkkaa-mme , etc.  vastaa-n, vastaa-t, vastaa, vastaa-mme , etc.  tarjoa-n, tarjoa-t, tarjoa-a, tarjoa-mme , etc.   The consonant in the stem appears in strong grade.  Imperfect indicative  The imperfect stem can be obtained from the infinitive by changing the final t to s , followed by the usual imperfect marker i ; the stem consonant appears in strong grade. Examples with personal endings: halusi-n = "I wanted", tapasi-t = "you met", vastasi , "he answered", etc.  Passive  Passives in this type are formed in the same fashion as for type I verbs; as in type I, the stem consonant appears in the weak grade. Examples:   haluta  $\rightarrow$ halutaan, haluttiin, haluttaisiin  tavata  $\rightarrow$ tavataan, tavattiin, tavattaisiin  vastata  $\rightarrow$ vastataan, vastattu, vastattiin, etc.   Type V verbs  All the verbs in this groups have infinitives ending in ita/itä . This type has few members; tarvita = "to need" is a common example.  The indicative stem may be obtained by dropping the final a and adding 'se': tarvitsen, tarvitset, tarvitsee, tarvitsemme, tarvitsette, tarvitsevat.  Imperfect indicative  -si takes the place of -se , but in the third-person singular, there is only one vowel, e.g.:   tarvitsin, tarvitsit, tarvitsi, tarvitsimme, tarvitsitte, tarvitsivat    Passive  The passive forms of these verbs are built just like those of type IV, since both types end in -ta:   valita $\rightarrow$ valitaan, valittiin, valittaisiin  merkitä $\rightarrow$ merkitään, merkittiin, merkittäisiin   Type VI verbs  Almost all verbs of this type have infinitives ending in 'eta' (notable exceptions being parata = "to improve/become better" and huonota = "to deteriorate/become worse"). There are not many verbs which fall into this category, and these don't tend to be commonly used. However, it is a fairly common route for turning adjectives into verbs; for example kylmä = "cold", kylmetä = "to get cold".  The present stem for this type is characterized by the insertion of ne after the infinitive stem; as a consequence, the final syllable of the stem is open, and hence the final consonant of the stem is in strong grade. Examples:   ''rohje-ta' = "to dare"  rohkene n = "I dare"  rohkene t = "you dare"  rohkene e = 'he/she/it dares' etc.    pae-ta = "to escape", pakene n = "I escape"  kylme-tä = "to get cold", kylmene n = "I get cold"  para-ta = "to improve" (intransitive), parane n = "I improve"   Imperfect indicative  The imperfect indicative of this type of verb is formed by replacing the final "e" of the "ne" stem with the imperfect marker "i". Thus:    rohkeni n = "I dared"  rohkeni t = "you dared"  rohkeni = "he/she/it dared" etc.     Passive  Passives of this type are formed in the same way as for type IV verbs.  Non-derivable and irregular stems  Standard Finnish has comparatively very few irregular verbs in addition to 'olla' discussed above. However, because the infinitive is an inflected form of the root, the consonant gradation may obscure the root. The root of the word 'juosta' = 'to run' is juoks- ; when generating the infinitive, the pattern ks → s is applied: juoks+ta → juosta . Epenthetic 'e' is added for personal forms, e.g. juoksen .  There is a rare pattern where a stem with -k- is rendered as -hdä in the infinitive, but disappears in gradation, e.g.:   'tehdä' = 'to do, make': tee-; teen, teet, tekee, teemme, teette, tekevät, etc.  'nähdä' = 'to see': näe-; näen, näet, näkee, näemme, näette, näkevät, etc.   That is, teke- and näke- forms are rendered as tehdä and nähdä in the infinitive but are subject to gradation of 'k' in personal forms like teen . In some colloquial forms, the 'e' is rendered as a chroneme instead: nään instead of näen etc.  Spoken language adds some more irregular verbs by assimilative deletion, e.g.:   tulla - tule - tuu  mennä - mene - mee  panna - pane - paa  olla - ole - oo   Computer program for inflexion and syntax of the Finnish verb   "Tuuli" available in http://www.wakkanet.fi/%7Epahio/esitteet.html  Verbix: conjugation of Finnish verbs   Online Finnish Verb Conjugators  http://www.romania-sanakirja.net/online/verbs/conjugate_verb.php  http://www.verbix.com/languages/finnish.shtml  Notes and references    "  Category:Finnish grammar  Category:Verbs by language     Pirjo Leino: Suomen kielioppi pg 114 Infinitive Subject.
