   Proper map      Proper map   In mathematics , a function between topological spaces is called proper if inverse images of compact subsets are compact. In algebraic geometry , the analogous concept is called a proper morphism .  Definition  A function  f : X → Y between two topological spaces is proper if the preimage of every compact set in Y is compact in X .  There are several competing descriptions. For instance, a continuous map f is proper if it is a closed map and the pre-image of every point in Y is compact. The two definitions are equivalent if Y is locally compact and Hausdorff. For a proof of this fact see the end of this section. More abstractly, f is proper if f is universally closed, i.e. if for any topological space Z the map   f × id Z : X × Z → Y × Z    is closed. These definitions are equivalent to the previous one if X is Hausdorff and Y is locally compact Hausdorff.  An equivalent, possibly more intuitive definition when X and Y are metric spaces is as follows: we say an infinite sequence of points { p i } in a topological space X  escapes to infinity if, for every compact set S ⊂ X only finitely many points p i are in S . Then a continuous map f : X → Y is proper if and only if for every sequence of points { p i } that escapes to infinity in X , { f ( p i )} escapes to infinity in Y .  This last sequential idea looks like being related to the notion of sequentially proper, see a reference below.  Proof of fact  Let    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   be a continuous closed map, such that     f   -  1     (  y  )        superscript  f    1    y    f^{-1}(y)   is compact (in X) for all    y  ∈  Y      y  Y    y\in Y   . Let   K   K   K   be a compact subset of   Y   Y   Y   . We will show that     f   -  1     (  K  )        superscript  f    1    K    f^{-1}(K)   is compact.  Let    {   U  λ   |    λ   ∈  Λ   }     conditional-set   subscript  U  λ     λ  normal-Λ     \{U_{\lambda}|\lambda\ \in\ \Lambda\}   be an open cover of     f   -  1     (  K  )        superscript  f    1    K    f^{-1}(K)   . Then for all     k   ∈  K      k  K    k\ \in K   this is also an open cover of     f   -  1     (  k  )        superscript  f    1    k    f^{-1}(k)   . Since the latter is assumed to be compact, it has a finite subcover. In other words, for all     k   ∈  K      k  K    k\ \in K   there is a finite set     γ  k   ⊂  Λ       subscript  γ  k   normal-Λ    \gamma_{k}\subset\Lambda   such that      f   -  1     (  k  )    ⊂    ∪   λ  ∈   γ  k      U  λ           superscript  f    1    k     subscript     λ   subscript  γ  k      subscript  U  λ      f^{-1}(k)\subset\cup_{\lambda\in\gamma_{k}}U_{\lambda}   . The set    X  ∖   ∪   λ  ∈   γ  k      U  λ      fragments  X    subscript     λ   subscript  γ  k      subscript  U  λ     X\setminus\cup_{\lambda\in\gamma_{k}}U_{\lambda}   is closed. Its image is closed in Y, because f is a closed map. Hence the set       V  k   =  Y  ∖  f   (  X  ∖   ∪   λ  ∈   γ  k      U  λ   )      fragments   subscript  V  k    Y   f   fragments  normal-(  X    subscript     λ   subscript  γ  k      subscript  U  λ   normal-)     V_{k}=Y\setminus f(X\setminus\cup_{\lambda\in\gamma_{k}}U_{\lambda})   is open in Y. It is easy to check that    V  k     subscript  V  k    V_{k}   contains the point   k   k   k   . Now    K  ⊂    ∪   k  ∈  K     V  k        K    subscript     k  K     subscript  V  k      K\subset\cup_{k\in K}V_{k}   and because K is assumed to be compact, there are finitely many points     k  1   ,  …  ,   k  s       subscript  k  1   normal-…   subscript  k  s     k_{1},\dots,k_{s}   such that    K  ⊂    ∪   i  =  1   s    V   k  i         K    superscript   subscript     i  1    s    subscript  V   subscript  k  i       K\subset\cup_{i=1}^{s}V_{k_{i}}   . Furthermore the set    Γ  =    ∪   i  =  1   s    γ   k  i         normal-Γ    superscript   subscript     i  1    s    subscript  γ   subscript  k  i       \Gamma=\cup_{i=1}^{s}\gamma_{k_{i}}   is a finite union of finite sets, thus   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is finite.  Now it follows that      f   -  1     (  K  )    ⊂    f   -  1     (    ∪   i  =  1   s    V   k  i     )    ⊂    ∪   λ  ∈  Γ     U  λ             superscript  f    1    K      superscript  f    1      superscript   subscript     i  1    s    subscript  V   subscript  k  i             subscript     λ  normal-Γ     subscript  U  λ       f^{-1}(K)\subset f^{-1}(\cup_{i=1}^{s}V_{k_{i}})\subset\cup_{\lambda\in\Gamma}%
 U_{\lambda}   and we have found a finite subcover of     f   -  1     (  K  )        superscript  f    1    K    f^{-1}(K)   , which completes the proof.  Properties   A topological space is compact if and only if the map from that space to a single point is proper.  Every continuous map from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is both proper and closed .  If f : X → Y is a proper continuous map and Y is a compactly generated Hausdorff space (this includes Hausdorff spaces which are either first-countable or locally compact ), then f is closed. 1   Generalization  It is possible to generalize the notion of proper maps of topological spaces to locales and topoi , see .
