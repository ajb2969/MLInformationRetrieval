Inverse image functor




Inverse image functor

In mathematics, the inverse image functor is a covariant construction of sheaves. The direct image functor is the primary operation on sheaves, with the simplest definition. The inverse image exhibits some relatively subtle features. 
Definition
Suppose given a sheaf 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  and that we want to transport 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  using a continuous map

 
 .
We will call the result the inverse image or pullback sheaf

 
 . If we try to imitate the direct image by setting


 
  for each open set 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , we immediately run into a problem
 
 
 
  is not necessarily open. The best we could do is to approximate it by open sets, and even then we will get a presheaf and not a sheaf. Consequently, we define 
 
 
 
  to be the sheaf associated to the presheaf:


 
  (Here 
 
 
 
  is an open subset of 
 
 
 
  and the colimit runs over all open subsets 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  containing 
 
 
 
 .)
For example, if 
 
 
 
  is just the inclusion of a point 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is just the stalk of 
 
 
 
  at this point.
The restriction maps, as well as the functoriality of the inverse image follows from the universal property of direct limits.
When dealing with morphisms

 
  of locally ringed spaces, for example schemes in algebraic geometry, one often works with sheaves of 
 
 
 
 -modules, where 
 
 
 
  is the structure sheaf of 
 
 
 
 . Then the functor 
 
 
 
  is inappropriate, because in general it does not even give sheaves of 
 
 
 
 -modules. In order to remedy this, one defines in this situation for a sheaf of 
 
 
 
 -modules 
 
 
 
  its inverse image by


 
 .
Properties

While 
 
 
 
  is more complicated to define than 
 
 
 
 , the stalks are easier to compute: given a point 
 
 
 
 , one has 
 
 
 
 .


 
  is an exact functor, as can be seen by the above calculation of the stalks.


 
  is (in general) only right exact. If 
 
 
 
  is exact, f is called flat.


 
  is the left adjoint of the direct image functor

 
 . This implies that there are natural unit and counit morphisms 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . These morphisms yield a natural adjunction correspondence:



 
 . However, these morphisms are almost never isomorphisms. For example, if 
 
 
 
  denotes the inclusion of a closed subset, the stalks of 
 
 
 
  at a point 
 
 
 
  is canonically isomorphic to 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  is in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  otherwise. A similar adjunction holds for the case of sheaves of modules, replacing 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 .
