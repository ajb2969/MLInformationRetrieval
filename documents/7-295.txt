Pseudo-ring

In mathematics, and more specifically in abstract algebra, a pseudo-ring is one of the following variants of a ring:

A rng, i.e., a structure satisfying all the axioms of a ring except for the existence of a multiplicative identity.1
A set R with two binary operations + and · such that (R,+) is an abelian group with identity 0, and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for all a, b, c in R.2
An abelian group (A,+) equipped with a subgroup B and a multiplication B × A → A making B a ring and A a B-module.3

No two of these definitions are equivalent, so it is best to avoid the term "pseudo-ring" or to clarify which meaning is intended.
