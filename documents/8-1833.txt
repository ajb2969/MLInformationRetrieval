   Householder operator      Householder operator   In Linear algebra , define the Householder operator as follows.  Let    V    V   V\,   be a finite dimensional inner product space with unit vector     u  ∈  V      u  V    u\in V   Then, the Householder operator is an operator      H  u   :   V  →   V       normal-:   subscript  H  u    normal-→  V  V     H_{u}:V\to V\,   defined by        H  u    (  x  )    =   x  -   2   ⟨  x  ,  u  ⟩    u            subscript  H  u   x     x    2   x  u   u      H_{u}(x)=x-2\langle x,u\rangle u\,   where    ⟨  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ⟩     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    \langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle   is the inner product over    V    V   V\,   . This operator reflects the vector   x   x   x   across a plane given by the normal vector   u   u   u   . 1  Over a real vector space , the Householder operator is also known as the Householder transformation .  The Householder operator has numerous properties such as linearity, being self-adjoint , and is a unitary or orthogonal operator on V.  References  "  Category:Numerical linear algebra     ↩
