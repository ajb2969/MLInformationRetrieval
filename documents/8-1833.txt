Householder operator

In Linear algebra, define the Householder operator as follows.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite dimensional inner product space with unit vector

 
  Then, the Householder operator is an operator

 
  defined by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the inner product over 
 
 
 
 . This operator reflects the vector 
 
 
 
  across a plane given by the normal vector 
 
 
 
 .1
Over a real vector space, the Householder operator is also known as the Householder transformation.
The Householder operator has numerous properties such as linearity, being self-adjoint, and is a unitary or orthogonal operator on V.
