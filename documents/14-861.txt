Each vertex is shared by 12 5-simplexes , 30 rectified 5-simplexes , and 20 birectified 5-simplexes . These facet types occur in proportions of 2:2:1 respectively in the whole honeycomb.  A5 lattice  This vertex arrangement is called the A 5 lattice or 5-simplex lattice . The 30 vertices of the stericated 5-simplex vertex figure represent the 30 roots of the     A  ~   5     subscript   normal-~  A   5    {\tilde{A}}_{5}   Coxeter group. 1 It is the 5-dimensional case of a simplectic honeycomb .  The A     5     2     subscript   superscript  absent  2   5    {}^{2}_{5}   lattice can be constructed as the union of two A 5 lattices:      ∪  The A     5     3     subscript   superscript  absent  3   5    {}^{3}_{5}   is the union of three A 5 lattices:      ∪  ∪ .  The A     5     *     subscript   superscript  absent    5    {}^{*}_{5}   lattice (also called A     5     6     subscript   superscript  absent  6   5    {}^{6}_{5}   ) is the union of six A 5 lattices, and is the dual vertex arrangement to the omnitruncated 5-simplex honeycomb , and therefore the Voronoi cell of this lattice is an omnitruncated 5-simplex .      ∪  ∪  ∪  ∪  ∪  = dual of  Related polytopes and honeycombs  Projection by folding  The 5-simplex honeycomb can be projected into the 3-dimensional cubic honeycomb by a geometric folding operation that maps two pairs of mirrors into each other, sharing the same vertex arrangement :           A  ~   5     subscript   normal-~  A   5    {\tilde{A}}_{5}                C  ~   3     subscript   normal-~  C   3    {\tilde{C}}_{3}         See also  Regular and uniform honeycombs in 5-space:   5-cubic honeycomb  5-demicube honeycomb  Truncated 5-simplex honeycomb  Omnitruncated 5-simplex honeycomb   Notes  References   Norman Johnson  Uniform Polytopes , Manuscript (1991)  Kaleidoscopes: Selected Writings of H.S.M.
