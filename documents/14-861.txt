 ×2, [6]]> |- |Properties||vertex-transitive |} In five-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the 5-simplex honeycomb or hexateric honeycomb is a space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb or pentacomb). Each vertex is shared by 12 5-simplexes, 30 rectified 5-simplexes, and 20 birectified 5-simplexes. These facet types occur in proportions of 2:2:1 respectively in the whole honeycomb.
A5 lattice
This vertex arrangement is called the A5 lattice or 5-simplex lattice. The 30 vertices of the stericated 5-simplex vertex figure represent the 30 roots of the 
 
 
 
  Coxeter group.1 It is the 5-dimensional case of a simplectic honeycomb.
The A
 
 
 
  lattice can be constructed as the union of two A5 lattices:




∪ 
The A
 
 
 
 
  is the union of three A5 lattices:




∪  ∪ .
The A
 
 
 
  lattice (also called A
 
 
 
 ) is the union of six A5 lattices, and is the dual vertex arrangement to the omnitruncated 5-simplex honeycomb, and therefore the Voronoi cell of this lattice is an omnitruncated 5-simplex.

Projection by folding
The 5-simplex honeycomb can be projected into the 3-dimensional cubic honeycomb by a geometric folding operation that maps two pairs of mirrors into each other, sharing the same vertex arrangement:
