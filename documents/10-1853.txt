   Oxalate CoA-transferase      Oxalate CoA-transferase   In enzymology , an oxalate CoA-transferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   succinyl-CoA + oxalate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   succinate + oxalyl-CoA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are succinyl-CoA and oxalate , whereas its two products are succinate and oxalyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the CoA-transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is succinyl-CoA:oxalate CoA-transferase . Other names in common use include succinyl-beta-ketoacyl-CoA transferase , and oxalate coenzyme A-transferase . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism .
