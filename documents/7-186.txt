   Dilation (operator theory)      Dilation (operator theory)   In operator theory , a dilation of an operator T on a Hilbert space  H is an operator on a larger Hilbert space K , whose restriction to H composed with the orthogonal projection onto H is T .  More formally, let T be a bounded operator on some Hilbert space H , and H be a subspace of a larger Hilbert space '' H' ''. A bounded operator V on '' H' '' is a dilation of T if           P  H    V   |   H   =  T       evaluated-at     subscript  P  H   V   H   T    P_{H}\;V|_{H}=T     where    P  H     subscript  P  H    P_{H}   is an orthogonal projection on H .  V is said to be a unitary dilation (respectively, normal, isometric, etc.) if V is unitary (respectively, normal, isometric, etc.). T is said to be a compression of V . If an operator T has a spectral set    X   X   X   , we say that V is a normal boundary dilation or a normal    ∂  X      X    \partial X   dilation if V is a normal dilation of T and     σ   (  V  )    ∈   ∂  X         σ  V     X     \sigma(V)\in\partial X   .  Some texts impose an additional condition. Namely, that a dilation satisfy the following (calculus) property:           P  H    f   (  V  )    |   H   =   f   (  T  )         evaluated-at     subscript  P  H   f  V   H     f  T     P_{H}\;f(V)|_{H}=f(T)     where f(T) is some specified functional calculus (for example, the polynomial or H ∞ calculus). The utility of a dilation is that it allows the "lifting" of objects associated to T to the level of V , where the lifted objects may have nicer properties. See, for example, the commutant lifting theorem .  Applications  We can show that every contraction on Hilbert spaces has a unitary dilation. A possible construction of this dilation is as follows. For a contraction T , the operator       D  T   =    (   I  -    T  *   T    )    1  2         subscript  D  T    superscript    I     superscript  T    T      1  2      D_{T}=(I-T^{*}T)^{\frac{1}{2}}     is positive, where the continuous functional calculus is used to define the square root. The operator D T is called the defect operator of T . Let V be the operator on      H  ⊕  H     direct-sum  H  H    H\oplus H     defined by the matrix       V  =   [     T     D   T  *          D   T      -   T  *       ]    .      V    T   subscript  D   superscript  T        subscript  D  T      superscript  T         V=\begin{bmatrix}T&D_{T^{*}}\\
 \ D_{T}&-T^{*}\end{bmatrix}.     V is clearly a dilation of T . Also, T ( I - T*T ) = ( I - TT* ) T implies        T   D  T    =    D   T  *    T    .        T   subscript  D  T       subscript  D   superscript  T     T     TD_{T}=D_{T^{*}}T.     Using this one can show, by calculating directly, that V is unitary, therefore an unitary dilation of T . This operator V is sometimes called the Julia operator of T .  Notice that when T is a real scalar, say    T  =   cos  θ       T    θ     T=\cos\theta   , we have       V  =   [      cos  θ      sin  θ         sin   θ      -   cos  θ       ]    .      V      θ     θ       θ       θ        V=\begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta&\sin\theta\\
 \ \sin\theta&-\cos\theta\end{bmatrix}.     which is just the unitary matrix describing rotation by θ. For this reason, the Julia operator V(T) is sometimes called the elementary rotation of T .  We note here that in the above discussion we have not required the calculus property for a dilation. Indeed, direct calculation shows the Julia operator fails to be a "degree-2" dilation in general, i.e. it need not be true that       T  2   =       P  H     V  2    |   H        superscript  T  2    evaluated-at     subscript  P  H    superscript  V  2    H     T^{2}=P_{H}\;V^{2}|_{H}   .  However, it can also be shown that any contraction has a unitary dilation which does have the calculus property above. This is Sz.-Nagy's dilation theorem . More generally, if    ℛ   (  X  )       ℛ  X    \mathcal{R}(X)   is a Dirichlet algebra , any operator T with   X   X   X   as a spectral set will have a normal    ∂  X      X    \partial X   dilation with this property. This generalises Sz.-Nagy's dilation theorem as all contractions have the unit disc as a spectral set.  References   T.
