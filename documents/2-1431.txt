   Woodin cardinal      Woodin cardinal   In set theory , a Woodin cardinal (named for W. Hugh Woodin ) is a cardinal number λ such that for all functions   f : λ → λ   there exists a cardinal κ j(f)(κ) ⊆ M .  An equivalent definition is this: λ is Woodin if and only if λ is strongly inaccessible and for all    A  ⊆   V  λ       A   subscript  V  λ     A\subseteq V_{\lambda}   there exists a    λ  A     subscript  λ  A    \lambda_{A}   -   A   A   A   -strong.      λ  A     subscript  λ  A    \lambda_{A}   being -   A   A   A   -strong means that for all ordinals α j: V \to M which is an elementary embedding with critical point     λ  A     subscript  λ  A    \lambda_{A}   ,     j   (   λ  A   )    >  α        j   subscript  λ  A    α    j(\lambda_{A})>\alpha   ,     V  α   ⊆  M       subscript  V  α   M    V_{\alpha}\subseteq M   and      j   (  A  )    ∩   V  α    =   A  ∩   V  α            j  A    subscript  V  α      A   subscript  V  α      j(A)\cap V_{\alpha}=A\cap V_{\alpha}   . (See also strong cardinal .)  A Woodin cardinal is preceded by a stationary set of measurable cardinals , and thus it is a Mahlo cardinal . However, the first Woodin cardinal is not even weakly compact .  Consequences  Woodin cardinals are important in descriptive set theory . By a result 1 of Martin and Steel , existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals implies projective determinacy , which in turn implies that every projective set is measurable , has the Baire property (differs from an open set by a meager set , that is, a set which is a countable union of nowhere dense sets), and the perfect set property (is either countable or contains a perfect subset).  The consistency of the existence of Woodin cardinals can be proved using determinacy hypotheses. Working in ZF + AD + DC one can prove that    Θ  0     subscript  normal-Θ  0    \Theta_{0}   is Woodin in the class of hereditarily ordinal-definable sets.    Θ  0     subscript  normal-Θ  0    \Theta_{0}   is the first ordinal onto which the continuum cannot be mapped by an ordinal-definable surjection (see Θ (set theory) ).  Shelah proved that if the existence of a Woodin cardinal is consistent then it is consistent that the nonstationary ideal on ω 1 is    ℵ  2     subscript  normal-ℵ  2    \aleph_{2}   -saturated. Woodin also proved the equiconsistency of the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals and the existence of an    ℵ  1     subscript  normal-ℵ  1    \aleph_{1}   -dense ideal over    ℵ  1     subscript  normal-ℵ  1    \aleph_{1}   .  Hyper-Woodin cardinals  A cardinal κ is called hyper-Woodin if there exists a normal measure  U on κ such that for every set S , the set   {λ < κ | λ is <κ- S - strong }   is in U .  λ is <κ-S-strong if and only if for each δ j(S) \cap H_\delta = S \cap H_\delta.  The name alludes to the classical result that a cardinal is Woodin if and only if for every set S , the set   {λ < κ | λ is <κ- S - strong }   is a stationary set  The measure U will contain the set of all Shelah cardinals below κ.  Weakly hyper-Woodin cardinals  A cardinal κ is called weakly hyper-Woodin if for every set S there exists a normal measure  U on κ such that the set {λ = δ, and       j   (  S  )    ∩   H  δ    =   S  ∩   H  δ     .          j  S    subscript  H  δ      S   subscript  H  δ      j(S)\cap H_{\delta}=S\cap H_{\delta}.     The name alludes to the classic result that a cardinal is Woodin if for every set S , the set {λ  Further reading      For proofs of the two results listed in consequences see Handbook of Set Theory (Eds.
