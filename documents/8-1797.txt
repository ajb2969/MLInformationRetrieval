   Unit tangent bundle      Unit tangent bundle   In Riemannian geometry , a branch of mathematics , the unit tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold ( M , g ), denoted by UT( M ) or simply UT M , is the unit sphere bundle for the tangent bundle T( M ). It is a fiber bundle over M whose fiber at each point is the unit sphere in the tangent bundle:        UT   (  M  )    :=    ∐   x  ∈  M     {   v  ∈    T  x    (  M  )     |     g  x    (  v  ,  v  )    =  1   }     ,     assign    UT  M     subscript  coproduct    x  M     conditional-set    v     subscript  normal-T  x   M         subscript  g  x    v  v    1       \mathrm{UT}(M):=\coprod_{x\in M}\left\{v\in\mathrm{T}_{x}(M)\left|g_{x}(v,v)=1%
 \right.\right\},     where T x ( M ) denotes the tangent space to M at x . Thus, elements of UT( M ) are pairs ( x , v ), where x is some point of the manifold and v is some tangent direction (of unit length) to the manifold at x . The unit tangent bundle is equipped with a natural projection       π  :    UT   (  M  )    →  M    ,     normal-:  π   normal-→    UT  M   M     \pi:\mathrm{UT}(M)\to M,          π  :    (  x  ,  v  )   ↦  x    ,     normal-:  π   maps-to   x  v   x     \pi:(x,v)\mapsto x,     which takes each point of the bundle to its base point. The fiber π −1 ( x ) over each point x ∈ M is an ( n −1)- sphere  S n −1 , where n is the dimension of M . The unit tangent bundle is therefore a sphere bundle over M with fiber S n −1 .  The definition of unit sphere bundle can easily accommodate Finsler manifolds as well. Specifically, if M is a manifold equipped with a Finsler metric F : T M → R , then the unit sphere bundle is the subbundle of the tangent bundle whose fiber at x is the indicatrix of F :         UT  x    (  M  )    =   {   v  ∈    T  x    (  M  )     |    F   (  v  )    =  1   }    .         subscript  UT  x   M    conditional-set    v     subscript  normal-T  x   M        F  v   1      \mathrm{UT}_{x}(M)=\left\{v\in\mathrm{T}_{x}(M)\left|F(v)=1\right.\right\}.     If M is an infinite-dimensional manifold (for example, a Banach , Fréchet or Hilbert manifold ), then UT( M ) can still be thought of as the unit sphere bundle for the tangent bundle T( M ), but the fiber π −1 ( x ) over x is then the infinite-dimensional unit sphere in the tangent space.  Structures  The unit tangent bundle carries a variety of differential geometric structures. The metric on M induces a contact structure on UT M . This is given in terms of a tautological one-form θ, defined at a point u of UT M (a unit tangent vector of M ) by        θ  u    (  v  )    =   g   (  u  ,    π  *   v   )           subscript  θ  u   v     g   u     subscript  π    v       \theta_{u}(v)=g(u,\pi_{*}v)\,   where π * is the pushforward along π of the vector v ∈ T u UT M .  Geometrically, this contact structure can be regarded as the distribution of (2 n −2)-planes which, at the unit vector u , is the pullback of the orthogonal complement of u in the tangent space of M . This is a contact structure, for the fiber of UT M is obviously an integral manifold (the vertical bundle is everywhere in the kernel of θ), and the remaining tangent directions are filled out by moving up the fiber of UT M . Thus the maximal integral manifold of θ is (an open set of) M itself.  On a Finsler manifold, the contact form is defined by the analogous formula        θ  u    (  v  )    =    g  u    (  u  ,    π  *   v   )           subscript  θ  u   v      subscript  g  u    u     subscript  π    v       \theta_{u}(v)=g_{u}(u,\pi_{*}v)\,   where g u is the fundamental tensor (the hessian of the Finsler metric). Geometrically, the associated distribution of hyperplanes at the point u ∈ UT x M is the inverse image under π * of the tangent hyperplane to the unit sphere in T x M at u .  The volume form θ∧ d θ n −1 defines a measure on M , known as the kinematic measure , or Liouville measure , that is invariant under the geodesic flow of M . As a Radon measure , the kinematic measure μ is defined on compactly supported continuous functions ƒ on UT M by        ∫   U  T  M      f   d  μ    =       ∫  M    d  V   (  p  )     ∫   U   T  p   M    f     |    U   T  p   M    d   μ  p          subscript     U  T  M      f  d  μ       evaluated-at    subscript   M     d  V  p    subscript     U   subscript  T  p   M    f       U   subscript  T  p   M    d   subscript  μ  p      \int_{UTM}f\,d\mu=\int_{M}dV(p)\int_{UT_{p}M}\left.f\right|_{UT_{p}M}\,d\mu_{p}   where d V is the volume element on M , and μ p is the standard rotationally-invariant Borel measure on the Euclidean sphere UT p M .  The Levi-Civita connection of M gives rise to a splitting of the tangent bundle       T   (   U  T  M   )    =   H  ⊕  V         T    U  T  M     direct-sum  H  V     T(UTM)=H\oplus V   into a vertical space V = kerπ * and horizontal space H on which π * is a linear isomorphism at each point of UT M . This splitting induces a metric on UT M by declaring that this splitting be an orthogonal direct sum, and defining the metric on H by the pullback:         g  H    (  v  ,  w  )    =    g   (  v  ,  w  )    ,  v    ,   w  ∈  H      formulae-sequence       subscript  g  H    v  w       g   v  w    v      w  H     g_{H}(v,w)=g(v,w),\quad v,w\in H   and defining the metric on V as the induced metric from the embedding of the fiber UT x M into the Euclidean space T x M . Equipped with this metric and contact form, UT M becomes a Sasakian manifold .  "  Category:Differential topology  Category:Ergodic theory  Category:Fiber bundles  Category:Riemannian geometry
