   Tobler's hiking function      Tobler's hiking function    Tobler's hiking function is an exponential function determining the hiking speed, taking into account the slope angle. 1 2 3 It was formulated by Waldo Tobler .  Formula  Walking velocity:      W  =   6   e   -   3.5   |      d  h    d  x     +  0.05   |           W    6   superscript  e      3.5          d  h     d  x    0.05          W=6e^{\displaystyle-3.5\left|\frac{dh}{dx}+0.05\right|}           d  h    d  x    =  S  =   tan  Θ             d  h     d  x    S         normal-Θ      \frac{dh}{dx}=S=\tan\Theta     where   dh = elevation difference,  dx = distance,  S = slope,  Θ = angle of slope (inclination).   On flat terrain this formula works out to 5 km/h. For off-path travel should be multiplied by 3/5, for horseback by 5/4. 4  References  See also   Naismith's rule  Preferred walking speed   "  Category:Hiking
