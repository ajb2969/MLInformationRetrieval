Tobler's hiking function

 Tobler's hiking function is an exponential function determining the hiking speed, taking into account the slope angle.123 It was formulated by Waldo Tobler.
Formula
Walking velocity:






where

dh = elevation difference,
 
dx = distance,
 
S = slope,
 
Θ = angle of slope (inclination).
 

On flat terrain this formula works out to 5 km/h. For off-path travel should be multiplied by 3/5, for horseback by 5/4.4
