   Multiplicity function for N noninteracting spins      Multiplicity function for N noninteracting spins   The multiplicity function for a two state paramagnet, W(n,N), is the number of spin states such that n of the N spins point in the z-direction. This function is given by the combinatoric function C(N,n) . That is:        W   (  n  ,  N  )    =   (      N      n      )   =    N  !     n  !     (   N  -  n   )   !             W   n  N     binomial  N  n            N       n       N  n         W(n,N)={N\choose n}={{N!}\over{n!(N-n)!}}      It is primarily used in introductory statistical mechanics and thermodynamics textbooks to explain the microscopic definition of entropy to students. If the spins are non-interacting, then the multiplicity function counts the number of states which have the same energy in an external magnetic field. By definition, the entropy S is then given by the natural logarithm of this number:       S  =   k   ln   W         S    k    W      S=k\ln{W}\,    1 Where k is the Boltzmann constant   References    "  Category:Thermodynamics     Schroeder, Daniel V..
