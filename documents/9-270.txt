   Rebound rate      Rebound rate   In basketball statistics , rebound rate or rebound percentage is a statistic to gauge how effective a player is at gaining possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw . Rebound rate is an estimate of the percentage of missed shots a player rebounded while he was on the floor. Using raw rebound totals to evaluate rebounding fails to take into account external factors unrelated to a player's ability, such as the number of shots taken in games and the percentage of those shots that are made. Both factors affect the number of missed shots that are available to be rebounded. Rebound rate takes these factors into account. 1  The formula are: 2     Rebound Rate  =     100  ×  Rebounds  ×    Team Minutes Played  5      Minutes Played  ×   (   Team Total Rebounds  +  Opposing Team Total Rebounds   )          Rebound Rate      100  Rebounds    Team Minutes Played  5      Minutes Played    Team Total Rebounds  Opposing Team Total Rebounds       \text{Rebound Rate}=\dfrac{100\times\text{Rebounds}\times\dfrac{\text{Team %
 Minutes Played}}{5}}{\text{Minutes Played}\times\left(\text{Team Total %
 Rebounds}+\text{Opposing Team Total Rebounds}\right)}       Offensive Rebound Rate  =     100  ×  Offensive Rebounds  ×    Team Minutes Played  5      Minutes Played  ×   (   Team Offensive Rebounds  +  Opposing Team Defensive Rebounds   )          Offensive Rebound Rate      100  Offensive Rebounds    Team Minutes Played  5      Minutes Played    Team Offensive Rebounds  Opposing Team Defensive Rebounds       \text{Offensive Rebound Rate}=\dfrac{100\times\text{Offensive Rebounds}\times%
 \dfrac{\text{Team Minutes Played}}{5}}{\text{Minutes Played}\times\left(\text{%
 Team Offensive Rebounds}+\text{Opposing Team Defensive Rebounds}\right)}       Defensive Rebound Rate  =     100  ×  Defensive Rebounds  ×    Team Minutes Played  5      Minutes Played  ×   (   Team Defensive Rebounds  +  Opposing Team Offensive Rebounds   )          Defensive Rebound Rate      100  Defensive Rebounds    Team Minutes Played  5      Minutes Played    Team Defensive Rebounds  Opposing Team Offensive Rebounds       \text{Defensive Rebound Rate}=\dfrac{100\times\text{Defensive Rebounds}\times%
 \dfrac{\text{Team Minutes Played}}{5}}{\text{Minutes Played}\times\left(\text{%
 Team Defensive Rebounds}+\text{Opposing Team Offensive Rebounds}\right)}     In the National Basketball Association (NBA), the statistic is available for seasons since the 1970–71 season. 3 The highest career rebound rate by a player is 23.4, by Dennis Rodman . The highest rebound rate for one season is 29.7, also by Dennis Rodman , which he achieved during the  season.  References  "  Category:Basketball statistics  Category:Rates     ↩   ↩
