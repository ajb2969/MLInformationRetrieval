Desuspension

In topology, a field within mathematics, desuspension is an operation inverse to suspension.1
Definition
In general, given an n-dimensional space 
 
 
 
 , the suspension 
 
 
 
  has dimension n + 1. Thus, the operation of suspension creates a way of moving up in dimension. In the 1950s, to define a way of moving down, mathematicians introduced an inverse operation 
 
 
 
 , called desuspension.2 Therefore, given an n-dimensional space 
 
 
 
 
 , the desuspension 
 
 
 
  has dimension n – 1.
Reasons
The reasons to introduce desuspension:

Desuspension makes the category of spaces a triangulated category.
If arbitrary coproducts were allowed, desuspension would result in all cohomology functors being representable.
