   Desuspension      Desuspension   In topology , a field within mathematics, desuspension is an operation inverse to suspension . 1  Definition  In general, given an n -dimensional space   X   X   X   , the suspension    Σ  X      normal-Σ  X    \Sigma{X}   has dimension n + 1. Thus, the operation of suspension creates a way of moving up in dimension. In the 1950s, to define a way of moving down, mathematicians introduced an inverse operation    Σ   -  1      superscript  normal-Σ    1     \Sigma^{-1}   , called desuspension. 2 Therefore, given an n -dimensional space   X   X   X   , the desuspension     Σ   -  1    X       superscript  normal-Σ    1    X    \Sigma^{-1}{X}   has dimension n – 1.  Reasons  The reasons to introduce desuspension:   Desuspension makes the category of spaces a triangulated category .  If arbitrary coproducts were allowed, desuspension would result in all cohomology  functors being representable.
