   Mucinaminylserine mucinaminidase      Mucinaminylserine mucinaminidase   In enzymology , a mucinaminylserine mucinaminidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-galactosyl-3-(N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl)-L-serine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-galactosyl-3-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine + L-serine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-galactosyl-3-(N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl)-L-serine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are D-galactosyl-3-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine and L-serine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-galactosyl-3-(N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl)-L-serine mucinaminohydrolase . Other names in common use include endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase , and endo-alpha-N-acetyl-D-galactosaminidase .  References       "  Category:EC 3.2.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
