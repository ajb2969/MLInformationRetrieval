   4 21 polytope      4 21 polytope        Orthogonal projections in E 6  Coxeter plane       4 21      Rectified 4 21      Birectified 4 21      In 8-dimensional geometry , the 4 21 is a semiregular uniform 8-polytope , constructed within the symmetry of the E 8  group . It was discovered by Thorold Gosset , published in his 1900 paper. He called it an 8-ic semi-regular figure . 1  Its Coxeter symbol is 4 21 , describing its bifurcating Coxeter-Dynkin diagram , with a single ring on the end of the 4-node sequences, .  The rectified 4 21 is constructed by points at the mid-edges of the 4 21 . The birectified 4 21 is constructed by points at the triangle face centers of the 4 21 . The trirectified 4 21 is constructed by points at the tetrahedral centers of the 4 21 , and is the same as the rectified 1 42 .  These polytopes are part of a family of 255 = 2 8 − 1 convex uniform 8-polytopes , made of uniform 7-polytope facets and vertex figures , defined by all permutations of one or more rings in this Coxeter-Dynkin diagram: .  4 21 polytope      4 21       Type     Family     Schläfli symbol     Coxeter symbol     Coxeter diagram     7-faces     6-faces     5-faces     4-faces     Cells     Faces     Edges     Vertices     Vertex figure     Petrie polygon     Coxeter group     Properties     The 4 21 is composed of 17,280 7-simplex and 2,160 7-orthoplex  facets . Its vertex figure is the 3 21 polytope.  For visualization this 8-dimensional polytope is often displayed in a special skewed orthographic projection direction that fits its 240 vertices within a regular triacontagon (called a Petrie polygon ). Its 6720 edges are drawn between the 240 vertices. Specific higher elements (faces, cells, etc.) can also be extracted and drawn on this projection.  As its 240 vertices represent the root vectors of the simple Lie group  E 8 , the polytope is sometimes referred to as the E 8 polytope .  The vertices of this polytope can be obtained by taking the 240 integral octonions of norm 1. Because the octonions are a nonassociative normed division algebra , these 240 points have a multiplication operation making them not into a group but rather a loop , in fact a Moufang loop .  Alternate names   This polytope was discovered by Thorold Gosset , who described it in his 1900 paper as an 8-ic semi-regular figure . 2 It is the last finite semiregular figure in his enumeration, semiregular to him meaning that it contained only regular facets.  E. L. Elte named it V 240 (for its 240 vertices) in his 1912 listing of semiregular polytopes. 3  H.S.M. Coxeter called it 4 21 because its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram has three branches of length 4, 2, and 1, with a single node on the terminal node of the 4 branch.  Dischiliahectohexaconta-myriaheptachiliadiacosioctaconta-zetton (Acronym Fy) - 2160-17280 facetted polyzetton (Jonathan Bowers) 4   Coordinates  It is created by a Wythoff construction upon a set of 8 hyperplane mirrors in 8-dimensional space.  The 240 vertices of the 4 21 polytope can be constructed in two sets: 112 (2 2 × 8 C 2 ) with coordinates obtained from    (   ±  2   ,   ±  2   ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  )      plus-or-minus  2    plus-or-minus  2   0  0  0  0  0  0    (\pm 2,\pm 2,0,0,0,0,0,0)\,   by taking an arbitrary combination of signs and an arbitrary permutation of coordinates, and 128 roots (2 7 ) with coordinates obtained from    (   ±  1   ,   ±  1   ,   ±  1   ,   ±  1   ,   ±  1   ,   ±  1   ,   ±  1   ,   ±  1   )      plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  1     (\pm 1,\pm 1,\pm 1,\pm 1,\pm 1,\pm 1,\pm 1,\pm 1)\,   by taking an even number of minus signs (or, equivalently, requiring that the sum of all the eight coordinates be a multiple of 4).  Each vertex has 56 nearest neighbors; for example, the nearest neighbors of the vertex    (  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  1  )     1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1    (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)   are those whose coordinates sum to 4, namely the 28 obtained by permuting the coordinates of    (  2  ,  2  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  )     2  2  0  0  0  0  0  0    (2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0)\,   and the 28 obtained by permuting the coordinates of    (  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,   -  1   ,   -  1   )     1  1  1  1  1  1    1     1     (1,1,1,1,1,1,-1,-1)   . These 56 points are the vertices of a 3 21 polytope in 7 dimensions.  Each vertex has 126 second nearest neighbors: for example, the nearest neighbors of the vertex    (  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  1  )     1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1    (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)   are those whose coordinates sum to 0, namely the 56 obtained by permuting the coordinates of    (  2  ,   -  2   ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  )     2    2   0  0  0  0  0  0    (2,-2,0,0,0,0,0,0)\,   and the 70 obtained by permuting the coordinates of    (  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,   -  1   ,   -  1   ,   -  1   ,   -  1   )     1  1  1  1    1     1     1     1     (1,1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1)   . These 126 points are the vertices of a 2 31 polytope in 7 dimensions.  Each vertex also has 56 third nearest neighbors, which are the negatives of its nearest neighbors, and one antipodal vertex, for a total of     1  +  56  +  126  +  56  +  1   =  240        1  56  126  56  1   240    1+56+126+56+1=240   vertices.  Tessellations  This polytope is the vertex figure for a uniform tessellation of 8-dimensional space, represented by symbol 5 21 and Coxeter-Dynkin diagram:      Construction and faces  The facet information of this polytope can be extracted from its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram :      Removing the node on the short branch leaves the 7-simplex :      Removing the node on the end of the 2-length branch leaves the 7-orthoplex in its alternated form ( 4 11 ):      Every 7-simplex facet touches only 7-orthoplex facets, while alternate facets of an orthoplex facet touch either a simplex or another orthoplex. There are 17,280 simplex facets and 2160 orthoplex facets.  Since every 7-simplex has 7 6-simplex facets, each incident to no other 6-simplex, the 4 21 polytope has 120,960 (7×17,280) 6-simplex faces that are facets of 7-simplexes. Since every 7-orthoplex has 128 (2 7 ) 6-simplex facets, half of which are not incident to 7-simplexes, the 4 21 polytope has 138,240 (2 6 ×2160) 6-simplex faces that are not facets of 7-simplexes. The 4 21 polytope thus has two kinds of 6-simplex faces, not interchanged by symmetries of this polytope. The total number of 6-simplex faces is 259200 (120,960+138,240).  The vertex figure of a single-ring polytope is obtained by removing the ringed node and ringing its neighbor(s). This makes the 3 21 polytope.

The first polytope in this family is the semiregular triangular prism which is constructed from three squares (2-orthoplexes) and two triangles (2-simplexes).  Geometric folding  (Figure)  The 4 21 polytope can be projected into 3-space as a physical vertex-edge model. Pictured here as 2 concentric 600-cells (at the golden ratio) using Zome tools. 6 (Not all of the 3360 edges of length √2(√5-1) are represented.)   The 4 21 is related to the 600-cell by a geometric folding of the Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams . This can be seen in the E8/H4 Coxeter plane projections. The 240 vertices of the 4 21 polytope are projected into 4-space as two copies of the 120 vertices of the 600-cell, one copy smaller than the other with the same orientation. Seen as a 2D orthographic projection in the E8/H4 Coxeter plane, the 120 vertices of the 600-cell are projected in the same four rings as seen in the 4 21 . The other 4 rings of the 4 21 graph also match a smaller copy of the four rings of the 600-cell.

Coxeter called it the Witting polytope , after Alexander Witting . 7  The 4 21 is sixth in a dimensional series of semiregular polytopes . Each progressive uniform polytope is constructed vertex figure of the previous polytope. Thorold Gosset identified this series in 1900 as containing all regular polytope facets, containing all simplexes and orthoplexes .

It is named for being a rectification of the 4 21 . Vertices are positioned at the midpoint of all the edges of 4 21 , and new edges connecting them.  The facet information can be extracted from its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram .      Removing the node on the short branch leaves the rectified 7-simplex :      Removing the node on the end of the 2-length branch leaves the rectified 7-orthoplex in its alternated form:      Removing the node on the end of the 4-length branch leaves the 3 21 :      The vertex figure is determined by removing the ringed node and adding a ring to the neighboring node.

Removing the node on the end of the 4-length branch leaves the rectified 3 21 . There are 240 of these facets.      The vertex figure is determined by removing the ringed node and adding rings to the neighboring nodes. This makes a 5-demicube -triangular duoprism.
