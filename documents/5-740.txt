   Free regular set      Free regular set   In mathematics , a free regular set is a subset of a topological space that is acted upon disjointly under a given group action . 1  To be more precise, let X be a topological space . Let G be a group of homeomorphisms from X to X . Then we say that the action of the group G at a point    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   is freely discontinuous if there exists a neighborhood  U of x such that      g   (  U  )    ∩  U   =  ∅          g  U   U      g(U)\cap U=\varnothing   for all    g  ∈  G      g  G    g\in G   , excluding the identity. Such a U is sometimes called a nice neighborhood of x .  The set of points at which G is freely discontinuous is called the free regular set and is sometimes denoted by    Ω  =   Ω   (  G  )        normal-Ω    normal-Ω  G     \Omega=\Omega(G)   . Note that   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is an open set .  If Y is a subset of X , then Y / G is the space of equivalence classes, and it inherits the canonical topology from Y ; that is, the projection from Y to Y / G is continuous and open.  Note that    Ω  /  G      normal-Ω  G    \Omega/G   is a Hausdorff space .  Examples  The open set       Ω   (  Γ  )    =   {   τ  ∈  H   :     |  τ  |   >  1   ,    |   τ  +   τ  ¯    |   <  1    }         normal-Ω  normal-Γ    conditional-set    τ  H    formulae-sequence      τ   1         τ   normal-¯  τ     1       \Omega(\Gamma)=\{\tau\in H:|\tau|>1,|\tau+\overline{\tau}|<1\}   is the free regular set of the modular group    Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   on the upper half-plane  H . This set is called the fundamental domain on which modular forms are studied.
