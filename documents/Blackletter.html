<h1>Blackletter</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Blackletter</strong>, also known as <strong>Gothic script</strong>, <strong>Gothic minuscule</strong>, or <strong>Textura</strong>, was a <a href="script_(styles_of_handwriting)" title="wikilink">script</a> used throughout <a href="Western_Europe" title="wikilink">Western Europe</a> from approximately 1150 to well into the 17th century. It continued to be used for the <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German language</a> until the 20th century. <a href="Fraktur_(script)" title="wikilink">Fraktur</a> is a notable script of this type, and sometimes the entire group of Blackletter faces is incorrectly referred to as Fraktur. Blackletter is sometimes called <strong>Old English</strong>, but it is not to be confused with the <a href="Old_English" title="wikilink">Old English language</a>, despite the popular, though mistaken, belief that the language was written with blackletter. The Old English, or Anglo-Saxon, language predates blackletter by many centuries, and was itself written in the <a href="insular_script" title="wikilink">insular script</a>, or <a class="uri" href="Futhorc" title="wikilink">Futhorc</a> runes before that.</p>
<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="Carolingian_minuscule" title="wikilink">Carolingian minuscule</a> was the direct ancestor of blackletter. Blackletter developed from Carolingian as an increasingly literate 12th-century Europe required new books in many different subjects. New <a href="Medieval_university" title="wikilink">universities</a> were founded, each producing books for <a class="uri" href="business" title="wikilink">business</a>, <a class="uri" href="law" title="wikilink">law</a>, <a class="uri" href="grammar" title="wikilink">grammar</a>, <a class="uri" href="history" title="wikilink">history</a>, and other pursuits, not solely religious works for which earlier <a href="script_(styles_of_handwriting)" title="wikilink">scripts</a> typically had been used.</p>

<p>These books needed to be produced quickly to keep up with demand. Carolingian, though legible, was time-consuming and labour-intensive to produce. Its large size consumed a lot of <a class="uri" href="manuscript" title="wikilink">manuscript</a> space in a time when writing materials were very costly. As early as the 11th century, different forms of Carolingian were already being used, and by the mid-12th century, a clearly distinguishable form, able to be written more quickly to meet the demand for new books, was being used in northeastern <a class="uri" href="France" title="wikilink">France</a> and the <a href="Low_Countries" title="wikilink">Low Countries</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-name-gothic">The name <em>Gothic</em></h2>

<p> The term <em>Gothic</em> was first used to describe this script in 15th-century <a class="uri" href="Italy" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, in the midst of the <a class="uri" href="Renaissance" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a>, because <a href="Renaissance_humanism" title="wikilink">Renaissance Humanists</a> believed it was barbaric. <em>Gothic</em> was a synonym for <em>barbaric</em>. <a href="Flavio_Biondo" title="wikilink">Flavio Biondo</a>, in <em>Italia Illustrata</em> (1531) thought it was invented by the <a class="uri" href="Lombards" title="wikilink">Lombards</a> after their invasion of Italy in the 6th century.</p>

<p>Not only were black-letter forms called <em>Gothic script</em>, but any other seemingly barbarian script, such as <a href="Visigothic_script" title="wikilink">Visigothic</a>, <a href="Beneventan_script" title="wikilink">Beneventan</a>, and <a href="Merovingian_script" title="wikilink">Merovingian</a>, were also labeled "Gothic", in contrast to <a href="Carolingian_minuscule" title="wikilink">Carolingian minuscule</a>, a highly legible script which the Humanists called <em><a href="humanist_minuscule" title="wikilink">littera antiqua</a></em>, "the ancient letter", wrongly believing that it was the script used by the <a href="ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Romans</a>. It was in fact invented in the reign of <a class="uri" href="Charlemagne" title="wikilink">Charlemagne</a>, although only used significantly after that era, and actually formed the basis for the later development of blackletter.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The black letter should not be confused either with the ancient <a href="Gothic_alphabet" title="wikilink">alphabet of the Gothic language</a>, nor with the <a class="uri" href="sans-serif" title="wikilink">sans-serif</a> <a class="uri" href="typefaces" title="wikilink">typefaces</a> that are also sometimes called <em>Gothic</em>.</p>
<h2 id="forms-of-black-letter">Forms of black letter</h2>
<h3 id="textualis">Textualis</h3>

<p><em>Textualis</em>, also known as <em>textura</em> or <em>Gothic bookhand</em>, was the most <a href="calligraphy" title="wikilink">calligraphic</a> form of black letter, and today is the form most associated with "Gothic". <a href="Johannes_Gutenberg" title="wikilink">Johannes Gutenberg</a> carved a textualis typeface – including a large number of <a href="ligature_(typography)" title="wikilink">ligatures</a> and common abbreviations – when he printed his <a href="Gutenberg_Bible" title="wikilink">42-line Bible</a>. However, the textualis was rarely used for typefaces afterwards.</p>

<p>According to Dutch scholar Gerard Lieftinck, the pinnacle of black-letter use occurred in the 14th and 15th centuries. For Lieftinck, the highest form of <em>textualis</em> was <em>littera textualis formata</em>, used for <em>de luxe</em> manuscripts. The usual form, simply <em>littera textualis</em>, was used for literary works and university texts. Lieftinck's third form, <em>littera textualis currens</em>, was the <a class="uri" href="cursive" title="wikilink">cursive</a> form of black letter, extremely difficult to read and used for textual <a href="Gloss_(annotation)" title="wikilink">glosses</a>, and less important books.</p>

<p><em>Textualis</em> was most widely used in France, the Low Countries, <a class="uri" href="England" title="wikilink">England</a>, and <a class="uri" href="Germany" title="wikilink">Germany</a>. Some characteristics of the script are:</p>
<ul>
<li>tall, narrow letters, as compared to their Carolingian counterparts.</li>
<li>letters formed by sharp, straight, angular lines, unlike the typically round Carolingian; as a result, there is a high degree of "breaking", i.e. lines that do not necessarily connect with each other, especially in curved letters.</li>
<li><a href="Ascender_(typography)" title="wikilink">ascenders</a> (in letters such as b, d, h) are vertical and often end in sharp <a href="Stroke_ending_(typography)" title="wikilink">finials</a></li>
<li>when a letter with a bow (in b, d, p, q) is followed by another letter with a bow (such as "be" or "po"), the bows overlap and the letters are joined by a straight line (this is known as "biting").</li>
<li>a related characteristic is the <a href="half_r" title="wikilink">half r</a>, the shape of <em>r</em> when attached to other letters with bows; only the bow and tail were written, connected to the bow of the previous letter. In other scripts, this only occurred in a <a href="ligature_(typography)" title="wikilink">ligature</a> with the letter o.</li>
<li>similarly related is the form of the letter d when followed by a letter with a bow; its ascender is then curved to the left, like the <a class="uri" href="uncial" title="wikilink">uncial</a> d. Otherwise the ascender is vertical.</li>
<li>the letters g, j, p, q, y, and the hook of h have descenders, but no other letters are written below the line.</li>
<li>the letter a has a straight back stroke, and the top loop eventually became closed, somewhat resembling the number 8. The letter s often has a diagonal line connecting its two bows, also somewhat resembling an 8, but the <a href="long_s" title="wikilink">long s</a> is frequently used in the middle of words.</li>
<li><a href="minim_(palaeography)" title="wikilink">minims</a>, especially in the later period of the script, do not connect with each other. This makes it very difficult to distinguish i, u, m, and n. A 14th-century example of the difficulty minims produced is, <em>mimi numinum niuium minimi munium nimium uini muniminum imminui uiui minimum uolunt</em> ("the smallest mimes of the gods of snow do not wish at all in their life that the great duty of the defences of the wine be diminished"). In black letter this would look like a series of single strokes. Dotted i and the letter j developed because of this. Minims may also have finials of their own.</li>
<li>the script has many more <a href="scribal_abbreviation" title="wikilink">scribal abbreviations</a> than Carolingian, adding to the speed in which it could be written.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="schwabacher">Schwabacher</h3>

<p><strong>Schwabacher</strong> was a black-letter form that was much used in early German print typefaces. It continued to be used occasionally until the 20th century. Characteristics of Schwabacher are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The small letter o is rounded on both sides, though at the top and at the bottom, the two strokes join in an angle. Other small letters have analogous forms.</li>
<li>The small letter g has a horizontal stroke at its top that forms crosses with the two downward strokes.</li>
<li>The capital letter H has a peculiar form somewhat reminiscent of the small letter h.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fraktur">Fraktur</h3>

<p><strong>Fraktur</strong> is a form of black letter that became the most common German black-letter typeface by the mid 16th century. Its use was so common that often any black-letter form is called <em>Fraktur</em> in Germany. Characteristics of Fraktur are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The left side of the small letter o is formed by an angular stroke, the right side by a rounded stroke. At the top and at the bottom, both strokes join in an angle. Other small letters have analogous forms.</li>
<li>The capital letters are compound of rounded c-shaped or s-shaped strokes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the entire alphabet in Fraktur (minus the <a href="long_s" title="wikilink">long s</a> and the <a href="ß" title="wikilink">sharp s (ß)</a>), using the <a class="uri" href="TeX" title="wikilink">TeX</a> \mathfrak font (see <a href="Help:_Displaying_a_formula" title="wikilink">Help: Displaying a formula</a>):</p>

<h3 id="cursiva">Cursiva</h3>

<p><em><a class="uri" href="Cursiva" title="wikilink">Cursiva</a></em> refers to a very large variety of forms of black letter; as with modern <a href="cursive_writing" title="wikilink">cursive writing</a>, there is no real standard form. It developed in the 14th century as a simplified form of <em>textualis</em>, with influence from the form of <em>textualis</em> as used for writing <a href="charter" title="wikilink">charters</a>. <em>Cursiva</em> developed partly because of the introduction of <a class="uri" href="paper" title="wikilink">paper</a>, which was smoother than <a class="uri" href="parchment" title="wikilink">parchment</a>. It was therefore, easier to write quickly on paper in a <a href="cursive" title="wikilink">cursive script</a>.</p>

<p>In <em>cursiva</em>, descenders are more frequent, especially in the letters f and s, and ascenders are curved and looped rather than vertical (seen especially in the letter d). The letters a, g, and s (at the end of a word) are very similar to their Carolingian forms. However, not all of these features are found in every example of <em>cursiva</em>, which makes it difficult to determine whether or not a script may be called <em>cursiva</em> at all.</p>

<p>Lieftinck also divided <em>cursiva</em> into three styles: <em>littera cursiva formata</em> was the most legible and calligraphic style. <em>Littera cursiva textualis</em> (or <em>libraria</em>) was the usual form, used for writing standard books, and it generally was written with a larger pen, leading to larger letters. <em>Littera cursiva currens</em> was used for textbooks and other unimportant books and it had very little standardization in forms.</p>
<h3 id="hybrida">Hybrida</h3>

<p><em><a class="uri" href="Hybrida" title="wikilink">Hybrida</a></em> is also called <em><a class="uri" href="bastarda" title="wikilink">bastarda</a></em> (especially in France), and as its name suggests, refers to a hybrid form of the script. It is a mixture of <em>textualis</em> and <em>cursiva</em>, developed in the early 15th century. From <em>textualis</em>, it borrowed vertical ascenders, while from <em>cursiva</em>, it borrowed long f and <a href="long_s" title="wikilink">ſ</a>, single-looped a, and g with an open descender (similar to Carolingian forms).</p>
<h3 id="donatus-kalender">Donatus-Kalender</h3>

<p>The <em><a class="uri" href="Donatus-Kalender" title="wikilink">Donatus-Kalender</a></em> (also known as Donatus-und-Kalender or D-K) is the name for the metal type design that <a href="Johannes_Gutenberg" title="wikilink">Gutenberg</a> used in his earliest surviving printed works, dating from the early 1450s. The name is taken from two works: the <a href="Ars_grammatica" title="wikilink">Ars grammatica</a> of <a href="Aelius_Donatus" title="wikilink">Aelius Donatus</a>, a Latin grammar, and the Kalender (calendar).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is a form of textura.</p>
<h2 id="black-letter-typesetting">Black-letter typesetting</h2>

<p>While an <a href="antiqua_script" title="wikilink">antiqua</a> typeface is usually compound of <a href="roman_type" title="wikilink">roman types</a> and <a href="italic_type" title="wikilink">italic types</a> since the 16th-century French typographers, the black-letter typefaces never developed a similar distinction. Instead, they use <a href="Emphasis_(typography)#Letter_spacing" title="wikilink">letterspacing</a> (German <em>sperren</em>) for emphasis. When using that method, black-letter ligatures like <em>ch</em>, <em>ck</em>, <em>tz</em> or <em>ſt</em> remain together without additional letterspacing (<em>ſt</em> is dissolved, though). The use of bold text for emphasis is also alien to black-letter typefaces.</p>

<p>Words from other languages, especially from Romance languages including Latin, are usually typeset in antiqua instead of black letter. Like that, single antiqua words or phrases may occur within a black-letter text. This does not apply, however, to loanwords that have been incorporated into the language.</p>
<h2 id="national-forms">National forms</h2>
<h3 id="england">England</h3>
<h4 id="textualis-1"><em>Textualis</em></h4>

<p> <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> black letter developed from the form of Caroline minuscule used there after the <a href="Norman_Conquest" title="wikilink">Norman Conquest</a>, sometimes called "Romanesque minuscule." <em>Textualis</em> forms developed after 1190 and were used most often until approximately 1300, afterward being used mainly for <em>de luxe</em> manuscripts. English forms of black letter have been studied extensively and may be divided into many categories. <em>Textualis formata</em> ("Old English" or "Black Letter"), <em>textualis prescissa</em> (or <em>textualis sine pedibus</em>, as it generally lacks feet on its minims), <em>textualis quadrata</em> (or <em>psalterialis</em>) and <em>semi-quadrata</em>, and <em>textualis rotunda</em> are various forms of high-grade <em>formata</em> styles of black letter.</p>

<p>The <a href="University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">University of Oxford</a> borrowed the <em>littera parisiensis</em> in the 13th century and early 14th century, and the <em>littera oxoniensis</em> form is almost indistinguishable from its Parisian counterpart; however, there are a few differences, such as the round final "s" forms, resembling the number 8, rather than the long "s" used in the final position in the Paris script.</p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Chaucer" title="wikilink">Chaucer</a> was originally printed in blackletter, but most presses were switched over to <a href="Roman_type" title="wikilink">Roman type</a> around 1590, following the trend of the <a class="uri" href="Renaissance" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="Horace_Walpole" title="wikilink">Horace Walpole</a> wrote in 1781 that "I am too, though a Goth, so modern a Goth that I hate the black letter, and I love Chaucer better in Dryden and Baskerville than in his own language and dress".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The final uses of blackletter in the 17th century were for printing ballads, chivalric romances, and jokebooks.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="cursiva-1"><em>Cursiva</em></h4>

<p>English <em>cursiva</em> began to be used in the 13th century, and soon replaced <em>littera oxoniensis</em> as the standard university script. The earliest cursive black-letter form is <em>Anglicana</em>, a very round and looped script, which also had a squarer and angular counterpart, <em>Anglicana formata</em>. The <em>formata</em> form was used until the 15th century and also was used to write vernacular texts. An <em>Anglicana bastarda</em> form developed from a mixture of <em>Anglicana</em> and <em>textualis</em>, but by the 16th century the principal cursive black letter used in England was the Secretary script, which originated in <a class="uri" href="Italy" title="wikilink">Italy</a> and came to England by way of France. Secretary script has a somewhat haphazard appearance, and its forms of the letters a, g, r, and s are unique, unlike any forms in any other English script.</p>
<h3 id="france">France</h3>
<h4 id="textualis-2"><em>Textualis</em></h4>

<p><a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a> <em>textualis</em> was tall and narrow compared to other national forms, and was most fully developed in the late 13th century in Paris. In the 13th century there also was an extremely small version of <a class="uri" href="textualis" title="wikilink">textualis</a> used to write miniature Bibles, known as "pearl script." Another form of French textualis in this century was the script developed at the <a href="University_of_Paris" title="wikilink">University of Paris</a>, <em>littera parisiensis</em>, which also is small in size and designed to be written quickly, not calligraphically.</p>
<h4 id="cursiva-2"><em>Cursiva</em></h4>

<p>French <em>cursiva</em> was used from the 13th to the 16th century, when it became highly looped, messy, and slanted. <em>Bastarda</em>, the "hybrid" mixture of <em>cursiva</em> and <em>textualis</em>, developed in the 15th century and was used for vernacular texts as well as Latin. A more angular form of <em>bastarda</em> was used in <a href="Duchy_of_Burgundy" title="wikilink">Burgundy</a>, the <em>lettre de forme</em> or <em>lettre bourgouignonne</em>, for <a href="book_of_hours" title="wikilink">books of hours</a> such as the <a href="Très_Riches_Heures" title="wikilink">Très Riches Heures</a> of <a href="John,_Duke_of_Berry" title="wikilink">John, Duke of Berry</a>.</p>
<h3 id="germany">Germany</h3>

<p> Despite the frequent association of black letter with <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German</a>, the script was actually very slow to develop in German-speaking areas. It developed first in those areas closest to France and then spread to the east and south in the 13th century. However, the German-speaking areas are where black letter remained in use the longest.</p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Schwabacher" title="wikilink">Schwabacher</a> typefaces dominated in Germany from about 1480 to 1530, and the style continued in use occasionally until the 20th century. Most importantly, all of the works of <a href="Martin_Luther" title="wikilink">Martin Luther</a>, leading to the <a href="Protestant_Reformation" title="wikilink">Protestant Reformation</a>, as well as the <a href="Apocalypse_(Dürer)" title="wikilink">Apocalypse</a> of <a href="Albrecht_Dürer" title="wikilink">Albrecht Dürer</a> (1498) used this typeface. <a href="Johann_Bämler" title="wikilink">Johann Bämler</a>, a printer from <a class="uri" href="Augsburg" title="wikilink">Augsburg</a>, probably first used it as early as 1472. The origins of the name remain unclear; some assume that a typeface-carver from the village of Schwabach—one who worked externally and who thus became known as the <em>Schwabacher</em>—designed the typeface.</p>
<h4 id="textualis-3"><em>Textualis</em></h4>

<p>German <em>Textualis</em> is usually very heavy and angular, and there are few features that are common to all occurrences of the script. One common feature is the use of the letter "w" for Latin "vu" or "uu". <em>Textualis</em> was used in the 13th and 14th centuries, afterward becoming more elaborate and decorated and used for liturgical works only.</p>

<p><a href="Johann_Gutenberg" title="wikilink">Johann Gutenberg</a> used a <em>textualis</em> <a class="uri" href="typeface" title="wikilink">typeface</a> for his famous <a href="Gutenberg_Bible" title="wikilink">Gutenberg Bible</a>, possibly the first book ever to be printed with movable type, in 1455. <a class="uri" href="Schwabacher" title="wikilink">Schwabacher</a>, a black letter with more rounded letters, soon became the usual printed <a class="uri" href="typeface" title="wikilink">typeface</a>, but it was replaced by <a href="Fraktur_(typeface)" title="wikilink">Fraktur</a> in the early 17th century.</p>

<p> Fraktur came into use when Emperor <a href="Maximilian_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Maximilian I</a> (1493–1519) established a series of books and had a new typeface created specifically for this purpose. In the 19th century, the use of antiqua alongside Fraktur increased, leading to the <a href="Antiqua-Fraktur_dispute" title="wikilink">Antiqua-Fraktur dispute</a>, which lasted until the <a href="Nazism" title="wikilink">Nazis</a> abandoned Fraktur in 1941. Since it was so common, all kinds of black letter tend to be called <em>Fraktur</em> in German.</p>
<h4 id="cursiva-3"><em>Cursiva</em></h4>

<p> German <em>cursiva</em> is similar to the cursive scripts in other areas, but forms of "a", "s" and other letters are more varied; here too, the letter "w" is often used. A <em>hybrida</em> form, which was basically <em>cursiva</em> with fewer looped letters and with similar square proportions as <em>textualis</em>, was used in the 15th and 16th centuries.</p>

<p>In the 18th century, the pointed quill was adopted for black-letter handwriting. In the early 20th century, the <a class="uri" href="Sütterlin" title="wikilink">Sütterlin</a> script was introduced in the schools.</p>

<h4 id="rotunda"><em>Rotunda</em></h4>

<p><a href="Italian_language" title="wikilink">Italian</a> black letter also is known as <a href="rotunda_(script)" title="wikilink">rotunda</a>, as it was less angular than in northern centres. The most usual form of Italian <em>rotunda</em> was <em>littera bononiensis</em>, used at the <a href="University_of_Bologna" title="wikilink">University of Bologna</a> in the 13th century. Biting is a common feature in <em>rotunda</em>, but breaking is not.</p>

<p>Italian <em>Rotunda</em> also is characterized by unique abbreviations, such as q with a line beneath the bow signifying "qui", and unusual spellings, such as x for s ("milex" rather than "miles").</p>
<h4 id="cursiva-4"><em>Cursiva</em></h4>

<p><a href="Italian_cursive" title="wikilink">Italian cursive</a> developed in the 13th century from scripts used by notaries. The more calligraphic form is known as <em>minuscola cancelleresca italiana</em> (or simply <em>cancelleresca</em>, <a href="chancery_hand" title="wikilink">chancery hand</a>), which developed into a <a href="book_hand" title="wikilink">book hand</a>, a script used for writing books rather than charters, in the 14th century. <em>Cancelleresca</em> influenced the development of <em><a class="uri" href="bastarda" title="wikilink">bastarda</a></em> in France and <a href="Secretary_hand" title="wikilink">Secretary hand</a> in England.</p>

<h4 id="textualis-4"><em>Textualis</em></h4>

<p>A textualis form, commonly known as <em>Gotisch</em> or 'Gothic script' was used for general publications from the fifteenth century on, but became restricted to official documents and religious publications during the seventeenth century. Its use persisted into the nineteenth century for editions of the <a href="Statenvertaling" title="wikilink">State Translation</a> of the <a class="uri" href="Bible" title="wikilink">Bible</a>, but had otherwise become obsolete.</p>
<h2 id="unicode">Unicode</h2>

<p>Mathematical black-letter characters are separately encoded in <a class="uri" href="Unicode" title="wikilink">Unicode</a> in the <a href="Mathematical_alphanumeric_symbols" title="wikilink">Mathematical alphanumeric symbols</a> range at U+1D504-1D537 and U+1D56C-1D59F (bold), except for individual letters already encoded in the <a href="Letterlike_Symbols" title="wikilink">Letterlike Symbols</a> range (plus <a href="long_s" title="wikilink">long s</a> at U+017F).</p>

<p>This block of characters should be used only for setting mathematical text, as mathematical texts use black-letter symbols contrastively to other letter styles. For stylized black-letter prose, the normal Latin letters should be used, with font choice or other markup used to indicate black-letter styling. The character names use "Fraktur" for the mathematical alphanumeric symbols, while "black-letter" is used for those symbol characters in the letterlike symbols range.</p>

<p>For normal text writing, the ordinary Latin code points are used. The black-letter style is then determined by a font with black-letter glyphs. The glyphs in the SMP should only be used for mathematical typesetting, not for ordinary text. They are of limited use for writing German, as they lack <a href="umlaut_(diacritic)" title="wikilink">umlaut diacritics</a> and the ligature <a class="uri" href="ß" title="wikilink">ß</a>.</p>
