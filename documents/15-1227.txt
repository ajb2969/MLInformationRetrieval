This is for producing templates , , and . It can also produce quantum state vectors in bra–ket notation, using wikicode, ideally with , as an alternative to LaTeX in  mode, but using this template ( {{braket}} ) is more clumsy than the simpler and more directly applicable $\langle |$, $| \rangle$, and $\langle \rangle$.
Application
There are three parameters, use as many as needed in this order:

Brackets: choose one of:
 
bra (for a bra vector),
ket (for a ket vector),
bra-ket (for the inner product), or

Symbol 1:

if 1 is set to bra or ket: enter the first symbol for the bra or ket,
if 1 is set to bra-ket: enter the symbol for the bra part of the inner product

Symbol 2:

if 1 is set to bra or ket: this parameter is not needed.
if 1 is set to bra-ket: enter the symbol for the ket part of the inner product


If 1 is set to bra-ket, the symbols are entered in the order they are read, left to right. The symbols can of course be bold, italic, underlined, any unicode symbol, etc.
Examples

Ket

A ket can be written: , that is {{braket|ket|ψ}}.
Using , a ket can be written: $$, that is ${{braket|ket|ψ}}$.

Bra

A bra can be written:  = †, that is {{braket|bra|ψ}} = {{braket|ket|ψ}}†.
Using , a bra can be written:  †}}, that is {{math|{{braket|bra|ψ}} {{=}} {{braket|ket|ψ}}†}}.

Bra-ket

The inner product of the kets  and  can be written:  = †, that is {{braket|bra-ket|ψ|ξ}} = {{braket|bra-ket|ξ|ψ}}†.
Using , the inner product of the kets $$ and $$ can be written:  †}}, that is {{math|{{braket|bra-ket|ψ|ξ}} {{=}} {{braket|bra-ket|ξ|ψ}}†}}.

Outer products

The outer product of the kets  and  can be written:  = []†, that is {{braket|ket|ψ}}{{braket|bra|ξ}} = [{{braket|ket|ξ}}{{braket|bra|ψ}}]†.
Using , the outer product of the kets $$ and $$ can be written:  []†}}, that is {{braket|ket|ψ}}{{braket|bra|ξ}} $=$ [{{braket|ket|ξ}}{{braket|bra|ψ}}]†.

Inner products including operators

The inner product of the kets  and Ĥ is written using a bra and ket separately between the operator (there is no third parameter for the operator symbol):


Ĥ = Ĥ†,


that is

{{braket|bra|ψ}}''Ĥ''{{braket|ket|ξ}} = {{braket|bra|ξ}}''Ĥ''†{{braket|ket|ψ}}.
 

Using , the inner product of the kets $$ and $Ĥ $ is written using a bra and ket separately between the operator:

 Ĥ†}},
 

that is

{{math|{{braket|bra|ψ}}''Ĥ''{{braket|ket|ξ}} {{=}} {{braket|bra|ξ}}''Ĥ''†{{braket|ket|ψ}}}}.
 


Schrödinger equation:

In wiki-markup rather than LaTeX:

 Ĥ ↔ −iħ {{=}} Ĥ†}}


that is,

{{math|''iħ''{{sfrac|''d''|''dt''}}{{braket|ket|Ψ(''t'')}} {{=}} ''Ĥ''{{braket|ket|Ψ(''t'')}} ↔ −''iħ''{{braket|bra|Ψ(''t'')}}{{sfrac|''d''|''dt''}} {{=}} {{braket|bra|Ψ(''t'')}}''Ĥ''†}}



Tensor products:

The tensor product of the kets  and  is written using the ket mode only (there is no paramter for tensor products):


≡ ⊗ ≡ ,


that is

{{braket|ket|ξ}}{{braket|ket|ψ}} ≡ {{braket|ket|ξ}}⊗{{braket|ket|ψ}} ≡ {{braket|ket|ξ, ψ}}.
 

Using , the tensor product of the kets $$ and $$ is written using the ket mode only:

$  ≡  ⊗  ≡ $,
 

that is

${{braket|ket|ξ}} {{braket|ket|ψ}} ≡ {{braket|ket|ξ}} ⊗ {{braket|ket|ψ}} ≡ {{braket|ket|ξ, ψ}}$.
