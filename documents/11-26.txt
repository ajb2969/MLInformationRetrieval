2-furoate—CoA ligase

In enzymology, a 2-furoate—CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + 2-furoate + CoA 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + 2-furoyl-CoA
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, 2-furoate, and CoA, whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and 2-furoyl-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-furoate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming). This enzyme is also called 2-furoyl coenzyme A synthetase.
