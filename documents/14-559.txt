   Pairwise sorting network      Pairwise sorting network   The pairwise sorting network is a sorting network discovered and published by Ian Parberry in 1992 in Parallel Processing Letters . 1 The pairwise sorting network has the same cost (number of comparators) and delay as the odd-even mergesort network . It requires       n   (   log  n   )    (    log  n   -  1   )    /  4   +  n   -  1            n    n       n   1    4   n   1    n(\log n)(\log n-1)/4+n-1   comparators and has depth      (   log  n   )    (    log  n   +  1   )    /  2          n       n   1    2    (\log n)(\log n+1)/2   .
