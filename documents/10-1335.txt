   6-hydroxynicotinate dehydrogenase      6-hydroxynicotinate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 6-hydroxynicotinate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   6-hydroxynicotinate + H 2 O + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2,6-dihydroxynicotinate + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 6-hydroxynicotinate , H 2 O , and O 2 , whereas its two products are 2,6-dihydroxynicotinate and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on CH or CH 2 groups with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-hydroxynicotinate:O2 oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 6-hydroxynicotinic acid hydroxylase , 6-hydroxynicotinic acid dehydrogenase , and 6-hydroxynicotinate hydroxylase .
