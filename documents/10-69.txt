   Hennessy–Milner logic      Hennessy–Milner logic   In computer science , Hennessy–Milner logic (HML) is a dynamic logic used to specify properties of a labeled transition system , a structure similar to an automaton. It was introduced in 1980 by Matthew Hennessy and Robin Milner in their paper 'On observing nondeterminism and concurrency' ( ICALP ).  Another variant of the HML involves the use of recursion to extend the expressibility of the logic, and is commonly referred to as 'Hennessy-Milner Logic with recursion'. 1 Recursion is enabled with the use of maximum and minimum fixed points.  Syntax  A formula is defined by the following BNF grammar for L some set of actions:      Φ  :  :=  t   t   |  f   f   |   Φ  1   ∧    Φ  2    |   Φ  1   ∨    Φ  2    |   [  L  ]    Φ   |   ⟨  L  ⟩   Φ     fragments  Φ  normal-:  assign  t  t  normal-|  f  f  normal-|   subscript  normal-Φ  1     subscript  normal-Φ  2   normal-|   subscript  normal-Φ  1     subscript  normal-Φ  2   normal-|   fragments  normal-[  L  normal-]   Φ  normal-|   fragments  normal-⟨  L  normal-⟩   Φ    \Phi::=tt\,\,\,|\,\,\,ff\,\,\,|\,\,\,\Phi_{1}\land\Phi_{2}\,\,\,|\,\,\,\Phi_{1%
