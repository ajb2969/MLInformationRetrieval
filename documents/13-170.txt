   Self-similarity matrix      Self-similarity matrix   In data analysis , the self-similarity matrix is a graphical representation of similar sequences in a data series.  Similarity can be explained by different measures, like spatial distance ( distance matrix ), correlation , or comparison of local histograms or spectral properties (e.g. IXEGRAM 1 ). This technique is also applied for the search of a given pattern in a long data series as in gene matching . A similarity plot can be the starting point for dot plots or recurrence plots .  Definition  To construct a self-similarity matrix, one first transforms a data series into an ordered sequences of feature vectors     V  =   (   v  1   ,   v  2   ,  …  ,   v  n   )       V    subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2   normal-…   subscript  v  n      V=(v_{1},v_{2},\ldots,v_{n})   , where each vector    v  i     subscript  v  i    v_{i}   describes the relevant features of a data series in a given local interval. Then the self-similarity matrix is formed by computing the similarity of pairs of feature vectors        S   (  j  ,  k  )    =    s   (   v  j   ,   v  k   )    j    ,   k  ∈   (  1  ,  …  ,  n  )       formulae-sequence      S   j  k       s    subscript  v  j    subscript  v  k     j      k   1  normal-…  n      S(j,k)=s(v_{j},v_{k})\quad j,k\in(1,\ldots,n)     where    s   (   v  j   ,   v  k   )       s    subscript  v  j    subscript  v  k      s(v_{j},v_{k})   is a function measuring the similarity of the two vectors, for instance, the inner product      s   (   v  j   ,   v  k   )    =    v  j   ⋅   v  k          s    subscript  v  j    subscript  v  k      normal-⋅   subscript  v  j    subscript  v  k      s(v_{j},v_{k})=v_{j}\cdot v_{k}   . Then similar segments of feature vectors will show up as path of high similarity along diagonals of the matrix. 2  Example  (Figure)  Similarity plot, a variant of recurrence plot, obtained for different views of human actions are shown to produce similar patterns. 3   See also   Recurrence plot  Distance matrix  Similarity matrix  Substitution matrix   References           External links   http://www.recurrence-plot.tk/related_methods.php   "  Category:Statistical charts and diagrams  Category:Visualization (graphic)     ↩  ↩  ↩
