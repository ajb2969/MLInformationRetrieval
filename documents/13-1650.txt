Owen's T function

In mathematics, Owen's T function T(h, a), named after statistician Donald Bruce Owen, is defined by



The function was first introduced by Owen in 1956.1
Applications
The function T(h, a) gives the probability of the event (X>h and 0) x="" y="" bivariate="" [[random="" [[standard="" [[statistically="" and="" are="" be="" calculate="" can="" distribution="" distribution|standard="" function="" independent|independent]]="" normal="" normal]]="" probabilitiesSowden, R R and Ashford, J R (1969).

2 and, from there, in the calculation of multivariate normal distribution probabilities.3 It also frequently appears in various integrals involving Gaussian functions.
Computer algorithms for the accurate calculation of this function are available;4 quadrature having been employed since the 1970s. 5
Properties























 
  Here Φ(x) is the standard normal cumulative density function


 
  More properties can be found in the literature.6
