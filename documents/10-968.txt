   (Formate-C-acetyltransferase)-activating enzyme      (Formate-C-acetyltransferase)-activating enzyme   In enzymology , a [formate-C-acetyltransferase]-activating enzyme () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + dihydroflavodoxin + [formate C-acetyltransferase]-glycine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5'-deoxyadenosine + L-methionine + flavodoxin semiquinone + [formate C-acetyltransferase]-glycin-2-yl radical   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl-L-methionine , dihydroflavodoxin , and formate C-acetyltransferase - glycine , whereas its 4 products are 5'-deoxy adenosine , L- methionine , flavodoxin semiquinone , and formate C-acetyltransferase -glycin-2-yl radical.  This radical SAM enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases . The systematic name of this enzyme class is [formate C-acetyltransferase]-glycine dihydroflavodoxin:S-adenosyl-L-methionine oxidoreductase (S-adenosyl-L-methionine cleaving) . Other names in common use include PFL activase , PFL-glycine:S-adenosyl-L-methionine H transferase (flavodoxin-oxidizing, S-adenosyl-L-methionine-cleaving) , formate acetyltransferase activating enzyme , formate acetyltransferase-glycine dihydroflavodoxin:S-adenosyl-L-methionine oxidoreductase (S-adenosyl-L-methionine cleaving) .
