Simple shear

In fluid mechanics, simple shear is a special case of deformation where only one component of velocity vectors has a non-zero value:
$\ V_x=f(x,y)$ $\ V_y=V_z=0$
And the gradient of velocity is constant and perpendicular to the velocity itself:
$\frac {\partial V_x} {\partial y} = \dot \gamma$,
where $\dot \gamma$ is the shear rate and:
$\frac {\partial V_x} {\partial x} = \frac {\partial V_x} {\partial z} = 0$
The deformation gradient tensor $\Gamma$ for this deformation has only one non-zero term:
$\Gamma = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & {\dot \gamma} & 0 \\  0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$
Simple shear with the rate $\dot \gamma$ is the combination of pure shear strain with the rate of $\dot \gamma \over 2$ and rotation with the rate of $\dot \gamma \over 2$:
$\Gamma =
 \begin{matrix} \underbrace \begin{bmatrix} 0 & {\dot \gamma} & 0 \\  0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
 \\ \mbox{simple shear}\end{matrix} =
 \begin{matrix} \underbrace \begin{bmatrix} 0 & {\dot \gamma \over 2} & 0 \\  {\dot \gamma \over 2} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \\ \mbox{pure shear} \end{matrix}
 + \begin{matrix} \underbrace \begin{bmatrix} 0 & {\dot \gamma \over 2} & 0 \\  {- { \dot \gamma \over 2}} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \\ \mbox{solid rotation} \end{matrix}$
Important examples of simple shear include laminar flow through long channels of constant cross-section (Poiseuille flow), and elastomeric bearing pads in base isolation systems to allow critical buildings to survive earthquakes undamaged.
Simple shear in solid mechanics
In solid mechanics, a simple shear deformation is defined as an isochoric plane deformation in which there are a set of line elements with a given reference orientation that do not change length and orientation during the deformation.1 This deformation is differentiated from a pure shear by virtue of the presence of a rigid rotation of the material.23
If $\mathbf{e}_1$ is the fixed reference orientation in which line elements do not deform during the deformation and $\mathbf{e}_1-\mathbf{e}_2$ is the plane of deformation, then the deformation gradient in simple shear can be expressed as
$$\boldsymbol{F} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \gamma & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.$$ We can also write the deformation gradient as
$$\boldsymbol{F} = \boldsymbol{\mathit{1}} +  \gamma\mathbf{e}_1\otimes\mathbf{e}_2.$$
