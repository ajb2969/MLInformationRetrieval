Solution of triangles

Solution of triangles () is the historical term for solving the main trigonometric problem of finding the characteristics of a triangle (angles and lengths of sides), when some of these are known. The triangle can be located on a plane or on a sphere. Applications requiring triangle solutions include geodesy, astronomy, construction, and navigation.

Standard notation in the triangle

]] A general form triangle has six main characteristics (see picture): three linear (side lengths 
 
 
 
 ) and three angular (
 
 
 
 ). The classical plane trigonometry problem is to specify three of the six characteristics and determine the other three. A triangle can be uniquely determined in this sense when given any of the following:12

Three sides (SSS)
Two sides and the included angle (SAS)
Two sides and an angle not included between them (SSA), if the side length adjacent to the angle is shorter than the other side length.
A side and the two angles adjacent to it (ASA)
A side, the angle opposite to it and an angle adjacent to it (AAS).
Three angles (AAA) on the sphere (but not in the plane).

For all cases in the plane, at least one of the side lengths must be specified. If only the angles are given, the side lengths cannot be determined, because any similar triangle is a solution.
Main theorems
thumb|upright=2.0|Overview of particular steps and tools used when solving plane triangles The standard method of solving the problem is to use fundamental relations.

Law of cosines:









Law of sines:



Sum of angles:



Law of tangents




There are other (sometimes practically useful) universal relations: the law of cotangents and Mollweide's formula.
Notes

To find an unknown angle, the law of cosines is safer than the law of sines. The reason is that the value of sine for the angle of the triangle does not uniquely determine this angle. For example, if 
 
 
 
 , the angle 
 
 
 
  can be equal either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 . Using the law of cosines avoids this problem: within the interval from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  the cosine value unambiguously determines its angle. On the other hand, if the angle is small (or close to 180°), then it is more robust numerically to determine it from its sine than its cosine because the arc-cosine function has a divergent derivative at 1 (or −1).
We assume that the relative position of specified characteristics is known. If not, the mirror reflection of the triangle will also be a solution. For example, three side lengths uniquely define either a triangle or its reflection.

Three sides given

Three sides given (SSS)
Let three side lengths 
 
 
 
  be specified. To find the angles 
 
 
 
 , the law of cosines can be used:3





 
  Then angle 
 
 
 
 .
Some sources recommend to find angle 
 
 
 
  from the law of sines but (as Note 1 above states) there is a risk of confusing an acute angle value with an obtuse one.
Another method of calculating the angles from known sides is to apply the law of cotangents.

Two sides and the included angle given

Two sides and the included angle given (SAS)
Here the lengths of sides 
 
 
 
  and the angle 
 
 
 
  between these sides are known. The third side can be determined from the law of cosines:4


 
  Now we use law of cosines to find the second angle:


 
  Finally,

Two sides and non-included angle given

]]
Two sides and non-included angle given (SSA)
This case is not solvable in all cases; a solution is guaranteed to be unique only if the side length adjacent to the angle is shorter than the other side length. Assume that two sides 
 
 
 
  and the angle 
 
 
 
  are known. The equation for the angle 
 
 
 
  can be implied from the law of sines:5


 
  We denote further 
 
 
 
  (equation's right side). There are four possible cases:

If 
 
 
 
 , no such triangle exists because the side 
 
 
 
  does not reach line BC. For the same reason a solution does not exist if the angle 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

If 
 
 
 
 , a unique solution exists
 
 
 
 , i.e., the triangle is right-angled.

Two solutions for triangle

]]


If 
 
 
 
  two alternatives are possible.

If 
 
 
 
  may be acute
 
 
 
  or obtuse
 
 
 
 . The picture on right shows the point 
 
 
 
 , the side 
 
 
 
  and the angle 
 
 
 
  as the first solution, and the point 
 
 
 
 , side 
 
 
 
  and the angle 
 
 
 
  as the second solution.
If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  (the larger side corresponds to a larger angle). Since no triangle can have two obtuse angles, 
 
 
 
  is acute angle and the solution 
 
 
 
  is unique.


Once 
 
 
 
  is obtained, the third angle 
 
 
 
 .
The third side can then be found from the law of sines:

A side and two adjacent angles given

]]
A side and two adjacent angles given (ASA)
The known characteristics are the side 
 
 
 
  and the angles 
 
 
 
 . The third angle 
 
 

Two unknown side can be calculated from the law of sines:6



A side, one adjacent angle and the opposite angle given (AAS)
The procedure for solving an AAS triangle is same as that for an ASA triangle: First, find the third angle by using the angle sum property of a triangle, then find the other two sides using the law of sines.

Spherical triangle

]]
Solving spherical triangles
General form spherical triangle is fully determined by three of its six characteristics (3 sides and 3 angles). Note that the sides of a spherical triangle 
 
 
 
  are usually measured rather by angular units than by linear, according to corresponding central angles.
Solution of triangles for non-Euclidean spherical geometry has some differences from the plane case. For example, the sum of the three angles 
 
 
 
  depends on the triangle. In addition, there are no unequal similar triangles, and so the problem of constructing a triangle with specified three angles has a unique solution. Basic relations used to solve a problem are like to the planar case: see Law of cosines (spherical) and Law of sines (spherical).
Among other relationships may be useful half-side formula and Napier's analogies:7

  can be calculated as above, or by using Napier's analogies:






This problem arises in the navigation problem of finding the great circle between 2 points on the earth specified by their latitude and longitude; in this application, it's important to use formulas which are not susceptible to round-off errors. For this purpose, the following formulas (which may be derived using vector algebra) can be used


 
  where the signs of the numerators and denominators in these expressions should be used to determine the quadrant of the arctangent.

Solving right-angled spherical triangles
The above algorithms become much simpler if one of the angles of a triangle (for example, the angle 
 
 
 
 ) is the right angle. Such a spherical triangle is fully defined by its two elements, and the other three can be calculated using Napier's Pentagon or the following relations.

Some applications
Triangulation
[[File:distance by triangulation.svg|thumb|right|320px|

Distance measurement by triangulation

]]
 
Suppose you want to measure the distance 
 
 
 
  from shore to remote ship. You must mark on the shore two points with known distance 
 
 
 
  between them (base line). Let 
 
 
 
  are the angles between base line and the direction to ship.
From the formulas above (ASA case) one can define the length of the triangle height:


 
  This method is used in cabotage. The angles 
 
 
 
  are defined by observations familiar landmarks from the ship.  [[File:mountain height by triangulation.png|thumb|right|320px|

How to measure a mountain height

]] Another example: you want to measure the height 
 
 
 
  of a mountain or a high building. The angles 
 
 
 
  from two ground points to the top are specified. Let 
 
 
 
  be the distance between tis points. From the same ASA case formulas we obtain:



The distance between two points on the globe
 That's how to calculate the distance between two points on the globe.

Point A: latitude 
 
 
 
  longitude 
 
 

Point B: latitude 
 
 
 
  longitude 
 
 


We consider the spherical triangle
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the north Pole. Some characteristics we know:








 
  It's the case: Two sides and the included angle given. From its formulas we obtain:
$$\mathrm{AB} = R \arccos\left\{\sin \lambda_\mathrm{A} \,\sin \lambda_\mathrm{B} + \cos \lambda_\mathrm{A} \,\cos \lambda_\mathrm{B} \,\cos \left(L_\mathrm{A}-L_\mathrm{B}\right)\right\},$$ Here $R$ is the Earth radius.
