Optical downconverter

Optical DownConverter (ODC) is an example of a non-linear optical process, in which two beams of light of different frequencies

 
  and 
 
 
 
  interact, creating microwave with frequency 
 
 
 
 . It is a generalization of microwave. In the latter, 
 
 
 
 , both of which can be provided by a single light source. From a quantum mechanical perspective, ODC can be seen as result of deferencing two photons to produce a microwave. Since the energy of a photon is given by



the frequency summing 
 
 
 
  is simply a statement that energy is conserved.
In a common ODC application, light from a tunable infrared laser is combined with light from a fixed frequency visible laser to produce a microwave created by a wave mixing process.
The ODC use milimeteric microwave cavity that include photonic crystal that provide by two signal frequency light source. The microwave is detected by the cavity antenna.
