Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse
In [[mathematics]], and in particular [[linear algebra]], a '''pseudoinverse''' {{math|''A''+}} of a  [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] {{math|''A''}} is a [[Generalized inverse|generalization]] of the [[inverse matrix]].{{cite book | last=Ben-Israel | first = Adi |author2=[[Thomas N.E. Greville]]  | title=Generalized Inverses | isbn=0-387-00293-6 | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]] | year=2003}}  The most widely known type of matrix pseudoinverse is the '''Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse''', which was independently described by [[E. H. Moore]]{{cite journal | last=Moore | first=E. H. | authorlink=E. H.

When referring to a matrix, the term pseudoinverse, without further specification, is often used to indicate the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse. The term generalized inverse is sometimes used as a synonym for pseudoinverse.
A common use of the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse (hereafter, just pseudoinverse) is to compute a 'best fit' (least squares) solution to a system of linear equations that lacks a unique solution (see below under § Applications). Another use is to find the minimum (Euclidean) norm solution to a system of linear equations with multiple solutions. The pseudoinverse facilitates the statement and proof of results in linear algebra.
The pseudoinverse is defined and unique for all matrices whose entries are real or complex numbers. It can be computed using the singular value decomposition.

Definition
For 
 
 
 
 , a pseudoinverse of 
 
 
 
  is defined as a matrix 
 
 
 
  satisfying all of the following four criteria:34



 
        ( need not be the general identity matrix, but it maps all column vectors of 
 
 
 
 
  to themselves);


 
        ( is a weak inverse for the multiplicative semigroup);


 
        ( is Hermitian); and


 
        ( is also Hermitian).



 
  exists for any matrix, 
 
 
 
 
 , but when the latter has full rank, 
 
 
 
  can be expressed as a simple algebraic formula.
In particular, when 
 
 
 
  has full column rank (and thus matrix 
 
 
 
  is invertible), 
 
 
 
  can be computed as:



This particular pseudoinverse constitutes a left inverse, since, in this case, 
 
 
 
 .
When 
 
 
 
  has full row rank (matrix 
 
 
 
  is invertible), 
 
 
 
  can be computed as:



This is a right inverse, as 
 
 
 
 .
Properties
Proofs for some of these facts may be found on a separate page here.
Existence and uniqueness

The pseudoinverse exists and is unique: for any matrix 
 
 
 
 , there is precisely one matrix 
 
 
 
 , that satisfies the four properties of the definition.5

A matrix satisfying the first condition of the definition is known as a generalized inverse. If the matrix also satisfies the second definition, it is called a  generalized reflexive inverse. Generalized inverses always exist but are not in general unique. Uniqueness is a consequence of the last two conditions.
Basic properties

If 
 
 
 
  has real entries, then so does 
 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is invertible, its pseudoinverse is its inverse. That is
 
 
 
 .6
The pseudoinverse of a zero matrix is its transpose.
The pseudoinverse of the pseudoinverse is the original matrix
 
 
 
 .7
Pseudoinversion commutes with transposition, conjugation, and taking the conjugate transpose:8










The pseudoinverse of a scalar multiple of 
 
 
 
 
  is the reciprocal multiple of :





 
  for 
 
 




Identities
The following identities can be used to cancel certain subexpressions or expand expressions involving pseudoinverses. Proofs for these properties can be found in the proofs subpage.






A^+ &=& A^+ & A^{+*} & A^*\\ A^+ &=& A^* & A^{+*} & A^+\\ A &=& A^{+*}& A^* & A \\ A &=& A & A^* & A^{+*}\\ A^* &=& A^* & A & A^+\\ A^* &=& A^+ & A & A^*\\ \end{array}
Reduction to Hermitian case
The computation of the pseudoinverse is reducible to its construction in the Hermitian case. This is possible through the equivalences:








as 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are obviously Hermitian.
Products
If 
 
 
 
  and either,



 
  has orthonormal columns (i.e., 
 
 
 
 ) or,


 
 
  has orthonormal rows (i.e., 
 
 
 
 ) or,


 
  has all columns linearly independent (full column rank) and 
 
 
 
  has all rows linearly independent (full row rank) or,


 
  (i.e., 
 
 
 
 
  is the conjugate transpose of 
 
 
 
 ),

then


 
 .
The last property yields the equivalences:



Projectors


 
  and 
 
 
 
  are orthogonal projection operators – that is, they are Hermitian (
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 ) and idempotent (
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ). The following hold:



 
  and

  (which equals the orthogonal complement of the kernel of 
 
 
 
 ).

 ).

Geometric construction
If we view the matrix as a linear map 
 
 
 
  over a field 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  can be decomposed as follows. We write 
 
 
 
  for the direct sum, 
 
 
 
  for the orthogonal complement, 
 
 
 
  for the kernel of a map, and 
 
 
 
  for the image of a map. Notice that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The restriction 
 
 
 
  is then an isomorphism. These imply that 
 
 
 
  is defined on 
 
 
 
  to be the inverse of this isomorphism, and on 
 
 
 
  to be zero.
In other words: To find 
 
 
 
  for given 
 
 
 
  in , first project 
 
 
 
  orthogonally onto the range of 
 
 
 
 , finding a point 
 
 
 
  in the range. Then form , i.e. find those vectors in  that 
 
 
 
  sends to 
 
 
 
 . This will be an affine subspace of  parallel to the kernel of 
 
 
 
 . The element of this subspace that has the smallest length (i.e. is closest to the origin) is the answer 
 
 
 
  we are looking for. It can be found by taking an arbitrary member of  and projecting it orthogonally onto the orthogonal complement of the kernel of 
 
 
 
 .
This description is closely related to the Minimum norm solution to a linear system.
Subspaces



Limit relations

The pseudoinverse are limits:





(see Tikhonov regularization). These limits exist even if 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  do not exist.10


Continuity

In contrast to ordinary matrix inversion, the process of taking pseudoinverses is not continuous: if the sequence 
 
 
 
  converges to the matrix 
 
 
 
  (in the maximum norm or Frobenius norm, say), then  need not converge to . However, if all the matrices have the same rank,  will converge to .11

Derivative
The derivative of a real valued pseudoinverse matrix which has constant rank at a point 
 
 
 
  may be calculated in terms of the derivative of the original matrix:12



Special cases
Scalars
It is also possible to define a pseudoinverse for scalars and vectors. This amounts to treating these as matrices. The pseudoinverse of a scalar 
 
 
 
  is zero if 
 
 
 
  is zero and the reciprocal of 
 
 
 
  otherwise:



Vectors
The pseudoinverse of the null (all zero) vector is the transposed null vector. The pseudoinverse of a non-null vector is the conjugate transposed vector divided by its squared magnitude:



Linearly independent columns
If the columns of 
 
 
 
  are linearly independent (so that 
 
 
 
 ), then 
 
 
 
  is invertible. In this case, an explicit formula is:13


 
 . It follows that 
 
 
 
  is then a left inverse of 
 
 
 
 :   
 
 
 
 .
Linearly independent rows
If the rows of 
 
 
 
  are linearly independent (so that 
 
 
 
 ), then 
 
 
 
  is invertible. In this case, an explicit formula is:


 
 . It follows that 
 
 
 
  is a right inverse of 
 
 
 
 :   
 
 
 
 .
Orthonormal columns or rows
This is a special case of either full column rank or full row rank (treated above). If 
 
 
 
  has orthonormal columns (
 
 
 
 ) or orthonormal rows (
 
 
 
 ), then 
 
 
 
 .
Circulant matrices
For a circulant matrix

 
 , the singular value decomposition is given by the Fourier transform, that is the singular values are the Fourier coefficients. Let 
 
 
 
  be the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrix, then14



Construction
Rank decomposition
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the rank of 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  can be (rank) decomposed as 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are of rank 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 .
The QR method
For 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  computing the product 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  and their inverses explicitly is often a source of numerical rounding errors and computational cost in practice. An alternative approach using the QR decomposition of 
 
 
 
  may be used instead.
Considering the case when 
 
 
 
  is of full column rank, so that 
 
 
 
 . Then the Cholesky decomposition

 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is an upper triangular matrix, may be used. Multiplication by the inverse is then done easily by solving a system with multiple right-hand sides,


 
  which may be solved by forward substitution followed by back substitution.
The Cholesky decomposition may be computed without forming 
 
 
 
  explicitly, by alternatively using the QR decomposition of 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  has orthonormal columns, 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is upper triangular. Then


 
 , so 
 
 
 
  is the Cholesky factor of 
 
 
 
 .
The case of full row rank is treated similarly by using the formula 
 
 
 
  and using a similar argument, swapping the roles of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Singular value decomposition (SVD)
A computationally simple and accurate way to compute the pseudo inverse is by using the singular value decomposition.151617 If 
 
 
 
  is the singular value decomposition of 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 . For a rectangular diagonal matrix such as 
 
 
 
 , we get the pseudo inverse by taking the reciprocal of each non-zero element on the diagonal, leaving the zeros in place, and then transposing the matrix. In numerical computation, only elements larger than some small tolerance are taken to be nonzero, and the others are replaced by zeros. For example, in the MATLAB, GNU Octave, or NumPy function pinv, the tolerance is taken to be 
 
 
 
 , where ε is the machine epsilon.
The computational cost of this method is dominated by the cost of computing the SVD, which is several times higher than matrix–matrix multiplication, even if a state-of-the art implementation (such as that of LAPACK) is used.
The above procedure shows why taking the pseudo inverse is not a continuous operation: if the original matrix 
 
 
 
  has a singular value 0 (a diagonal entry of the matrix 
 
 
 
  above), then modifying 
 
 
 
  slightly may turn this zero into a tiny positive number, thereby affecting the pseudo inverse dramatically as we now have to take the reciprocal of a tiny number.
Block matrices
Optimized approaches exist for calculating the pseudoinverse of block structured matrices.
The iterative method of Ben-Israel and Cohen
Another method for computing the pseudoinverse uses the recursion


 
  which is sometimes referred to as hyper-power sequence. This recursion produces a sequence converging quadratically to the pseudoinverse of 
 
 
 
  if it is started with an appropriate 
 
 
 
  satisfying 
 
 
 
 . The choice 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
  denoting the largest singular value of 
 
 
 
 ) 18 has been argued not to be competitive to the method using the SVD mentioned above, because even for moderately ill-conditioned matrices it takes a long time before 
 
 
 
  enters the region of quadratic convergence.19 However, if started with 
 
 
 
  already close to the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse and 
 
 
 
 , for example 
 
 
 
 , convergence is fast (quadratic).
Updating the pseudoinverse
For the cases where 
 
 
 
  has full row or column rank, and the inverse of the correlation matrix (
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  with full row rank or 
 
 
 
  for full column rank) is already known, the pseudoinverse for matrices related to 
 
 
 
  can be computed by applying the Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula to update the inverse of the correlation matrix, which may need less work. In particular, if the related matrix differs from the original one by only a changed, added or deleted row or column, incremental algorithms2021 exist that exploit the relationship.
Similarly, it is possible to update the Cholesky factor when a row or column is added, without creating the inverse of the correlation matrix explicitly. However, updating the pseudoinverse in the general rank-deficient case is much more complicated.2223
Software libraries
The package NumPy provides a pseudoinverse calculation through its functions matrix.I and linalg.pinv; its pinv uses the SVD-based algorithm. SciPy adds a function scipy.linalg.pinv that uses a least-squares solver. High quality implementations of SVD, QR, and back substitution are available in standard libraries, such as LAPACK. Writing one's own implementation of SVD is a major programming project that requires a significant numerical expertise. In special circumstances, such as parallel computing or embedded computing, however, alternative implementations by QR or even the use of an explicit inverse might be preferable, and custom implementations may be unavoidable.
Applications
Linear least-squares
The pseudoinverse provides a least squares solution to a system of linear equations.24 For 
 
 
 
 , given a system of linear equations



in general, a vector 
 
 
 
  that solves the system may not exist, or if one does exist, it may not be unique. The pseudoinverse solves the "least-squares" problem as follows:



 
 , we have 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denotes the Euclidean norm. This weak inequality holds with equality if and only if 
 
 
 
  for any vector w; this provides an infinitude of minimizing solutions unless A has full column rank, in which case 
 
 
 
  is a zero matrix.25The solution with minimum Euclidean norm is 
 
 
26

This result is easily extended to systems with multiple right-hand sides, when the Euclidean norm is replaced by the Frobenius norm. Let 
 
 
 
 .



 
 , we have 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denotes the Frobenius norm.

Obtaining all solutions of a linear system
If the linear system



has any solutions, they are all given by27



for arbitrary vector w. Solution(s) exist if and only if 
 
 
 
 .28 If the latter holds, then the solution is unique if and only if A has full column rank, in which case 
 
 
 
  is a zero matrix. If solutions exist but A does not have full column rank, then we have an indeterminate system, all of whose infinitude of solutions are given by this last equation. This solution is deeply connected to the Udwadia–Kalaba equation of classical mechanics to forces of constraint that do not obey D'Alembert's principle.
Minimum norm solution to a linear system
For linear systems 
 
 
 
  with non-unique solutions (such as under-determined systems), the pseudoinverse may be used to construct the solution of minimum Euclidean norm

 
  among all solutions.

If 
 
 
 
  is satisfiable, the vector 
 
 
 
  is a solution, and satisfies 
 
 
 
  for all solutions.

This result is easily extended to systems with multiple right-hand sides, when the Euclidean norm is replaced by the Frobenius norm. Let 
 
 
 
 .

If 
 
 
 
  is satisfiable, the matrix 
 
 
 
  is a solution, and satisfies 
 
 
 
  for all solutions.

Condition number
Using the pseudoinverse and a matrix norm, one can define a condition number for any matrix:


 
  A large condition number implies that the problem of finding least-squares solutions to the corresponding system of linear equations is ill-conditioned in the sense that small errors in the entries of 
 
 
 
  can lead to huge errors in the entries of the solution.29
Generalizations
In order to solve more general least-squares problems, one can define Moore–Penrose pseudoinverses for all continuous linear operators  between two Hilbert spaces  and , using the same four conditions as in our definition above. It turns out that not every continuous linear operator has a continuous linear pseudoinverse in this sense.30 Those that do are precisely the ones whose range is closed in .
In abstract algebra, a Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse may be defined on a *-regular semigroup. This abstract definition coincides with the one in linear algebra.
