   Strictly simple group      Strictly simple group   In mathematics , in the field of group theory , a group is said to be strictly simple if it has no proper nontrivial ascendant subgroups . That is,   G   G   G   is a strictly simple group if the only ascendant subgroups of   G   G   G   are    {  e  }     e    \{e\}   (the trivial subgroup), and   G   G   G   itself (the whole group).  In the finite case, a group is strictly simple if and only if it is simple . However, in the infinite case, strictly simple is a stronger property than simple.
