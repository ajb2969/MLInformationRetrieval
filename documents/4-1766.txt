   Weil pairing      Weil pairing   In mathematics , the Weil pairing is a pairing ( bilinear form , though with multiplicative notation ) on the points of order dividing n of an elliptic curve E , taking values in n th roots of unity. More generally there is a similar Weil pairing between points of order n of an abelian variety and its dual. It was introduced by André Weil ( Weil|1940}}|1940 ) for Jacobians of curves, who gave an abstract algebraic definition; the corresponding results for elliptic functions were known, and can be expressed simply by use of the Weierstrass sigma function .  Formulation  Choose an elliptic curve E defined over a field  K , and an integer n > 0 (we require n to be prime to char( K ) if char( K ) > 0) such that K contains a primitive nth root of unity . Then the n -torsion on $E(\overline{K})$ is known to be a Cartesian product of two cyclic groups of order n . The Weil pairing produces an n -th root of unity  $$w(P,Q) \in \mu_n$$  by means of Kummer theory , for any two points $P,Q \in E(K)[n]$ , where $E(K)[n]=\{T \in E(K) \mid n \cdot T = O \}$ and $\mu_n = \{x\in K \mid x^n =1 \}$ .  A down-to-earth construction of the Weil pairing is as follows. Choose a function F in the function field of E over the algebraic closure of K with divisor  $$\mathrm{div}(F)= \sum_{0 \leq k < n}(P+k\cdot Q) - \sum_{0 \leq k < n} (k\cdot Q).$$  So F has a simple zero at each point P + kQ , and a simple pole at each point kQ if these points are all distinct. Then F is well-defined up to multiplication by a constant. If G is the translation of F by Q , then by construction G has the same divisor, so the function G/F is constant.  Therefore if we define  $$w(P,Q):=\frac{G}{F}$$  we shall have an n -th root of unity (as translating n times must give 1) other than 1. With this definition it can be shown that w is alternating and bilinear, 1 giving rise to a non-degenerate pairing on the n -torsion.  The Weil pairing does not extend to a pairing on all the torsion points (the direct limit of n -torsion points) because the pairings for different n are not the same. However they do fit together to give a pairing T ℓ ( E ) × T ℓ ( E ) → T ℓ (μ) on the Tate module  T ℓ ( E ) of the elliptic curve E (the inverse limit of the ℓ n -torsion points) to the Tate module T ℓ (μ) of the multiplicative group (the inverse limit of ℓ n roots of unity).  Generalisation to abelian varieties  For abelian varieties over an algebraically closed field K , the Weil pairing is a nondegenerate pairing  $$A[n] \times A^\vee[n] \longrightarrow \mu_n$$  for all n prime to the characteristic of k . 2 Here $A^\vee$ denotes the dual abelian variety of A . This is the so-called Weil pairing for higher dimensions. If A is equipped with a polarisation  $$\lambda: A \longrightarrow A^\vee$$ , then composition gives a (possibly degenerate) pairing  $$A[n] \times A[n] \longrightarrow \mu_n.$$  If C is a projective, nonsingular curve of genus ≥ 0 over k , and J its Jacobian , then the theta-divisor of J induces a principal polarisation of J , which in this particular case happens to be an isomorphism (see autoduality of Jacobians ). Hence, composing the Weil pairing for J with the polarisation gives a nondegenerate pairing  $$J[n]\times J[n] \longrightarrow \mu_n$$  for all n prime to the characteristic of k .  As in the case of elliptic curves, explicit formulae for this pairing can be given in terms of divisors of C .  Applications  The pairing is used in number theory and algebraic geometry , and has also been applied in elliptic curve cryptography and identity based encryption .
