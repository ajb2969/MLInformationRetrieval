 }{e^{it}-1}    |  }}  In probability theory and statistics , the Van Houtum distribution is a discrete probability distribution named after prof. Geert-Jan van Houtum. 1 It can be characterized by saying that all values of a finite set of possible values are equally probable, except for the smallest and largest element of this set. Since the Van Houtum distribution is a generalization of the discrete uniform distribution , i.e. it is uniform except possibly at its boundaries, it is sometimes also referred to as quasi-uniform .  It is regularly the case that the only available information concerning some discrete random variable are its first two moments. The Van Houtum distribution can be used to fit a distribution with finite support on these moments.  A simple example of the Van Houtum distribution arises when throwing a loaded dice which has been tampered with to land on a 6 twice as often as on a 1. The possible values of the sample space are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Each time the die is thrown, the probability of throwing a 2, 3, 4 or 5 is 1/6; the probability of a 1 is 1/9 and the probability of throwing a 6 is 2/9.  Probability mass function  A random variable  U has a Van Houtum ( a , b , p a , p b ) distribution if its probability mass function is     μ   μ   \mu   has mean    c  2     superscript  c  2    c^{2}   and squared coefficient of variation    U   U   U   . Let   U   U   U   be a Van Houtum distributed random variable. Then the first two moments of   X   X   X   match the first two moments of   a   a   a   if   b   b   b   ,    p  a     subscript  p  a    p_{a}   ,    p  b     subscript  p  b    p_{b}   and   a   a   \displaystyle a   are chosen such that: 2     μ   μ   \mu     There does not exist a Van Houtum distribution for every combination of    c  2     superscript  c  2    c^{2}   and   μ   μ   \mu   . By using the fact that for any real mean    ⌊  μ  ⌋      μ    \lfloor\mu\rfloor   the discrete distribution on the integers that has minimal variance is concentrated on the integers    ⌈  μ  ⌉      μ    \lceil\mu\rceil   and       c  2    μ  2    ≥     (   μ  -   ⌊  μ  ⌋    )     (    1  +  μ   -   ⌈  μ  ⌉    )   2    +     (   μ  -   ⌊  μ  ⌋    )   2    (    1  +  μ   -   ⌈  μ  ⌉    )      .         superscript  c  2    superscript  μ  2          μ    μ     superscript      1  μ     μ    2       superscript    μ    μ    2       1  μ     μ        c^{2}\mu^{2}\geq(\mu-\lfloor\mu\rfloor)(1+\mu-\lceil\mu\rceil)^{2}+(\mu-%
 \lfloor\mu\rfloor)^{2}(1+\mu-\lceil\mu\rceil).   , it is easy to verify that a Van Houtum distribution (or indeed any discrete distribution on the integers) can only be fitted on the first two moments if 3  $$c^2\mu^2 \geq (\mu-\lfloor \mu \rfloor)(1+\mu-\lceil \mu \rceil)^2+(\mu-\lfloor \mu \rfloor)^2(1+\mu-\lceil \mu \rceil).$$  See also   Uniform distribution (discrete)   References  "  Category:Discrete distributions  Category:Probability distributions     A.
