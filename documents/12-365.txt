   Salinon      Salinon   (Figure)  The salinon (red) and the circle (blue) have the same area.   The salinon (meaning "salt-cellar" in Greek) is a geometrical figure that consists of four semicircles . It was first introduced in the Book of Lemmas , a work attributed to Archimedes . 1  Construction  Let O be the origin on a Cartesian plane . Let A , D , E , and B be four points on a line, in that order, with O bisecting line AB . Let AD = EB . Semicircles are drawn above line AB with diameters  AB , AD , and EB , and another semicircle is drawn below with diameter DE . A salinon is the figure bounded by these four semicircles. 2  Properties  Area  Archimedes introduced the salinon in his Book of Lemmas by applying Book II, Proposition 10 of Euclid's Elements . Archimedes noted that "the area of the figure bounded by the circumferences of all the semicircles [is] equal to the area of the circle on CF as diameter." 3  Namely, the area of the salinon is:       A  =    1  4   π    (    r  1   +   r  2    )   2     .      A      1  4   π   superscript     subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2    2      A=\frac{1}{4}\pi\left(r_{1}+r_{2}\right)^{2}.    4  Proof  Let the radius of the midpoint of AD and EB be denoted as G and H , respectively. Therefore, AG = GD = EH = HB = r 1 . Because DO , OF , and OE are all radii to the same semicircle, DO = OF = OE = r 2 . By segment addition, AG + GD + DO = OE + EH + HB = 2 r 1 + r 2 . Since AB is the diameter of the salinon, CF is the line of symmetry. Because they all are radii of the same semicircle, AO = BO = CO = 2 r 1 + r 2 .  Let P be the center of the large circle. Because CO = 2 r 1 + r 2 and OF = r 2 , CF = 2 r 1 + 2 r 2 . Therefore, the radius of the circle is r 1 + r 2 . The area of the circle = π( r 1 + r 2 ) 2 .  Let x = r 1 and y = r 2 . The area of the semicircle with diameter AB is:       A  B   =    1  2   π    (    2  x   +  y   )   2          A  B       1  2   π   superscript      2  x   y   2      AB=\frac{1}{2}\pi\left(2x+y\right)^{2}   .  The area of the semicircle with diameter DE is:       D  E   =    1  2   π   y  2          D  E       1  2   π   superscript  y  2      DE=\frac{1}{2}\pi y^{2}     The area of each of the semicircles with diameters AD and EB is       A  D   =   E  B   =    1  2   π   x  2            A  D     E  B            1  2   π   superscript  x  2       AD=EB=\frac{1}{2}\pi x^{2}     Therefore, the area of the salinon is:        1  2   π   (      (    2  x   +  y   )   2   -   2   x  2     +   y  2    )    =    1  2   π   (    2   x  2    +   4  x  y   +   2   y  2     )    =   π   (    x  2   +   2  x  y   +   y  2    )    =   π    (   x  +  y   )   2    =   π    (    r  1   +   r  2    )   2              1  2   π       superscript      2  x   y   2     2   superscript  x  2      superscript  y  2         1  2   π      2   superscript  x  2      4  x  y     2   superscript  y  2             π     superscript  x  2     2  x  y    superscript  y  2            π   superscript    x  y   2           π   superscript     subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2    2       \frac{1}{2}\pi\left(\left(2x+y\right)^{2}-2x^{2}+y^{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\pi%
 \left(2x^{2}+4xy+2y^{2}\right)=\pi\left(x^{2}+2xy+y^{2}\right)=\pi\left(x+y%
 \right)^{2}=\pi\left(r_{1}+r_{2}\right)^{2}     Q.E.D. 5  Arbelos  Should points D and E converge with O , it would form an arbelos , another one of Archimedes' creations, with symmetry along the y-axis . 6  See also   Lune of Hippocrates   References  External links  L’arbelos.
