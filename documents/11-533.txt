Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphatase

In enzymology, a phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 3-phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 3-phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol-3-phosphate 3-phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include inositol-1,3-bisphosphate 3-phosphatase, inositol 1,3-bisphosphate phosphatase, inositol-polyphosphate 3-phosphatase, D-myo-inositol-1,3-bisphosphate 3-phosphohydrolase, and phosphatidyl-3-phosphate 3-phosphohydrolase. This enzyme participates in inositol phosphate metabolism and phosphatidylinositol signaling system.
Structural studies
