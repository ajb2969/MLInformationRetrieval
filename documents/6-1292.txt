   Noetherian scheme      Noetherian scheme   In algebraic geometry , a noetherian scheme is a scheme that admits a finite covering by open affine subsets    Spec   A  i      Spec   subscript  A  i     \operatorname{Spec}A_{i}   ,    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}    noetherian rings . More generally, a scheme is locally noetherian if it is covered by spectra of noetherian rings. Thus, a scheme is noetherian if and only if it is locally noetherian and quasi-compact. As with noetherian rings, the concept is named after Emmy Noether .  It can be shown that, in a locally noetherian scheme, if    Spec  A     Spec  A    \operatorname{Spec}A   is an open affine subset, then A is a noetherian ring. In particular,    Spec  A     Spec  A    \operatorname{Spec}A   is a noetherian scheme if and only if A is a noetherian ring. Let X be a locally noetherian scheme. Then the local rings    ùí™   X  ,  x      subscript  ùí™   X  x     \mathcal{O}_{X,x}   are noetherian rings.  A noetherian scheme is a noetherian topological space . But the converse is false in general; consider, for example, the spectrum of a non-noetherian valuation ring.  The definitions extend to formal schemes .
