   Delta-v (physics)      Delta-v (physics)   In general physics, delta- v is simply a change in velocity . The Greek uppercase letter delta is the standard mathematical symbol to represent change in some quantity.  Depending on the situation, delta- v can be either a spatial vector (Δ v ) or scalar (Δ v ). In either case it is equal to the acceleration (vector or scalar) integrated over time:       Δ  𝐯   =    𝐯  1   -   𝐯  0    =    ∫   t  0    t  1      𝐚   d  t            normal-Δ  𝐯      subscript  𝐯  1    subscript  𝐯  0           subscript   superscript    subscript  t  1     subscript  t  0      𝐚  d  t       \Delta\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{v}_{1}-\mathbf{v}_{0}=\int^{t_{1}}_{t_{0}}\mathbf{a}%
 \,dt   (vector version)       Δ  v   =    v  1   -   v  0    =    ∫   t  0    t  1      a   d  t            normal-Δ  v      subscript  v  1    subscript  v  0           subscript   superscript    subscript  t  1     subscript  t  0      a  d  t       \Delta{v}={v}_{1}-{v}_{0}=\int^{t_{1}}_{t_{0}}{a}\,dt   (scalar version) where:   v 0 or v 0 is initial velocity (at time t 0 ),  v 1 or v 1 is subsequent velocity (at time t 1 ).   Change in velocity is useful in many cases, such as determining the change in momentum , where     Δ  𝐩   =   m  Δ  𝐯         normal-Δ  𝐩     m  normal-Δ  𝐯     \Delta{\mathbf{p}}=m\Delta{\mathbf{v}}   , where ,   𝐩   𝐩   \mathbf{p}   is momentum and m is mass.
