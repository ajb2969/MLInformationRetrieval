   Ketotetrose-phosphate aldolase      Ketotetrose-phosphate aldolase   In enzymology , a ketotetrose-phosphate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   erythrulose 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycerone phosphate + formaldehyde   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , erythrulose 1-phosphate , and two products , glycerone phosphate and formaldehyde .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is erythrulose-1-phosphate formaldehyde-lyase (glycerone-phosphate-forming) . Other names in common use include phosphoketotetrose aldolase , erythrulose-1-phosphate synthetase , erythrose-1-phosphate synthase , and erythrulose-1-phosphate formaldehyde-lyase .
