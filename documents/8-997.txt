   Frattini's argument      Frattini's argument   In group theory , a branch of mathematics , Frattini's argument is an important lemma in the structure theory of finite groups . It is named after Giovanni Frattini , who first used it in a paper from 1885 when defining the Frattini subgroup of a group.  Statement and proof   Frattini's Argument. If G is a finite group with normal subgroup H , and if P is a Sylow p -subgroup of H , then   G = N G ( P ) H ,   where N G ( P ) denotes the normalizer of P in G and N G ( P ) H means the product of group subsets .   Proof : P is a Sylow p -subgroup of H , so every Sylow p -subgroup of H is an H -conjugate h −1 Ph for some h ∈ H (see Sylow theorems ). Let g be any element of G . Since H is normal in G , the subgroup g −1 Pg is contained in H . This means that g −1 Pg is a Sylow p -subgroup of H . Then by the above, it must be H -conjugate to P : that is, for some h ∈ H   g −1 Pg = h −1 Ph ,   so   hg −1 Pgh −1 = P ;   thus   gh −1 ∈ N G ( P ),   and therefore g ∈ N G ( P ) H . But g ∈ G was arbitrary, so G = HN G ( P ) = N G ( P ) H .   □   normal-□   \square     Applications   Frattini's argument can be used as part of a proof that any finite nilpotent group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups.  By applying Frattini's argument to N G ( N G ( P )), it can be shown that N G ( N G ( P )) = N G ( P ) whenever G is a finite group and P is a Sylow p -subgroup of G .  More generally, if a subgroup M ≤ G contains N G ( P ) for some Sylow p -subgroup P of G , then M is self-normalizing, i.e.  M = N G ( M ).     Proof: M is normal in H := N G ( M ), and P is a Sylow p -subgroup of M , so the Frattini argument applied to the group H with normal subgroup M and Sylow p -subgroup P gives N H ( P ) M = H . Since N H ( P ) ≤ N G ( P ) ≤ M , one has the chain of inclusions M ≤ H = N H ( P ) M ≤ M  M = M , so M = H .   □   normal-□   \square        References    (See Chapter 10, especially Section 10.4.)
