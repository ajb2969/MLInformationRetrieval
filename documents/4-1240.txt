   Eccentricity vector      Eccentricity vector   In celestial mechanics , the eccentricity vector of a Kepler orbit is the vector that points towards the periapsis and has a magnitude equal to the orbit's scalar eccentricity . The magnitude is unitless . For Kepler orbits the eccentricity vector is a constant of motion. Its main use is in the analysis of almost circular orbits, as perturbing (non-Keplerian) forces on an actual orbit will cause the osculating eccentricity vector to change continuously. For the eccentricity and argument of periapsis parameters, eccentricity zero (circular orbit) corresponds to a singularity.  Calculation  The eccentricity vector     𝐞    𝐞   \mathbf{e}\,   can be calculated 1      𝐞  =     𝐯  ×  𝐡   μ   -   𝐫   |  𝐫  |         𝐞        𝐯  𝐡   μ     𝐫    𝐫       \mathbf{e}={\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{h}\over{\mu}}-{\mathbf{r}\over{\left|%
