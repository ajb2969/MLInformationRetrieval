   Chevalley–Warning theorem      Chevalley–Warning theorem   In algebra, the Chevalley–Warning theorem implies that certain polynomial equations in sufficiently many variables over a finite field have solutions. It was proved by  and a slightly weaker form of the theorem, known as Chevalley's theorem , was proved by . Chevalley's theorem implied Artin's and Dickson's conjecture that finite fields are quasi-algebraically closed fields .  Statement of the theorems  Let   𝔽   𝔽   \mathbb{F}   be a finite field and      {   f  j   }    j  =  1   r   ⊆   𝔽   [   X  1   ,  …  ,   X  n   ]         superscript   subscript    subscript  f  j      j  1    r     𝔽    subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  n       \{f_{j}\}_{j=1}^{r}\subseteq\mathbb{F}[X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}]   be a set of polynomials such that the number of variables satisfies      n  >    ∑   j  =  1   r    d  j        n    superscript   subscript     j  1    r    subscript  d  j      n>\sum_{j=1}^{r}d_{j}     where    d  j     subscript  d  j    d_{j}   is the total degree of    f  j     subscript  f  j    f_{j}   . The theorems are statements about the solutions of the following system of polynomial equations          f  j    (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =  0      for   j   =   1  ,  …  ,  r     .     formulae-sequence       subscript  f  j     subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n     0       for  j    1  normal-…  r      f_{j}(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})=0\quad\text{for}\,j=1,\ldots,r.      Chevalley–Warning theorem states that the number of common solutions     (   a  1   ,  …  ,   a  n   )   ∈   𝔽  n         subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  n     superscript  𝔽  n     (a_{1},\dots,a_{n})\in\mathbb{F}^{n}   is divisible by the characteristic    p   p   p   of   𝔽   𝔽   \mathbb{F}   . Or in other words, the cardinality of the vanishing set of     {   f  j   }    j  =  1   r     superscript   subscript    subscript  f  j      j  1    r    \{f_{j}\}_{j=1}^{r}   is   0   0    modulo   p   p   p   .  Chevalley's theorem states that if the system has the trivial solution     (  0  ,  …  ,  0  )   ∈   𝔽  n        0  normal-…  0    superscript  𝔽  n     (0,\dots,0)\in\mathbb{F}^{n}   , i.e. if the polynomials have no constant terms, then the system also has a non-trivial solution     (   a  1   ,  …  ,   a  n   )   ∈    𝔽  n   \   {   (  0  ,  …  ,  0  )   }          subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  n     normal-\   superscript  𝔽  n     0  normal-…  0       (a_{1},\dots,a_{n})\in\mathbb{F}^{n}\backslash\{(0,\dots,0)\}   .   Chevalley's theorem is an immediate consequence of the Chevalley–Warning theorem since   p   p   p   is at least 2.  Both theorems are best possible in the sense that, given any   n   n   n   , the list      f  j   =   x  j    ,   j  =   1  ,  …  ,  n       formulae-sequence     subscript  f  j    subscript  x  j      j   1  normal-…  n      f_{j}=x_{j},j=1,\dots,n   has total degree   n   n   n   and only the trivial solution. Alternatively, using just one polynomial, we can take f 1 to be the degree n polynomial given by the norm of x 1 a 1 + ... + x n a n where the elements a form a basis of the finite field of order p n .  Proof of Warning's theorem  Remark: If    𝔽  n     superscript  𝔽  n    \mathbb{F}^{n}   so the sum over     x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n       subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}   of any polynomial in    n   (   p  -  1   )       n    p  1     n(p-1)   of degree less than   p   p   p   also vanishes.  The total number of common solutions modulo      f  1   ,  …  ,   f  r    =  0        subscript  f  1   normal-…   subscript  f  r    0    f_{1},\ldots,f_{r}=0   of     ∑   x  ∈   𝔽  n       (   1  -    f  1   p  -  1     (  x  )     )   ⋅  …  ⋅   (   1  -    f  r   p  -  1     (  x  )     )        subscript     x   superscript  𝔽  n      normal-⋅    1     superscript   subscript  f  1     p  1    x    normal-…    1     superscript   subscript  f  r     p  1    x       \sum_{x\in\mathbb{F}^{n}}(1-f_{1}^{p-1}(x))\cdot\ldots\cdot(1-f_{r}^{p-1}(x))   is equal to      f  i     subscript  f  i    f_{i}   because each term is 1 for a solution and 0 otherwise. If the sum of the degrees of the polynomials    q  b     superscript  q  b    q^{b}   is less than n then this vanishes by the remark above.  Artin's conjecture  It is a consequence of Chevalley's theorem that finite fields are quasi-algebraically closed . This had been conjectured by Emil Artin in 1935. The motivation behind Artin's conjecture was his observation that quasi-algebraically closed fields have trivial Brauer group , together with the fact that finite fields have trivial Brauer group by Wedderburn's theorem .  The Ax–Katz theorem  The Ax–Katz theorem , named after James Ax and Nicholas Katz , determines more accurately a power   q   q   q   of the cardinality   𝔽   𝔽   \mathbb{F}   of   d   d   d   dividing the number of solutions; here, if    d  j     subscript  d  j    d_{j}   is the largest of the   b   b   b   , then the exponent      n  -    ∑  j    d  j     d   .        n    subscript   j    subscript  d  j     d    \frac{n-\sum_{j}d_{j}}{d}.   can be taken as the ceiling function of     q   q   q     The Ax–Katz result has an interpretation in étale cohomology as a divisibility result for the (reciprocals of) the zeroes and poles of the local zeta-function . Namely, the same power of $q$ divides each of these algebraic integers .
