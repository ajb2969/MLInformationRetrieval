   Exalcomm      Exalcomm   In algebra, Exalcomm is a functor classifying the extensions of a commutative algebra by a module . More precisely, the elements of Exalcomm k ( R , M ) are isomorphism classes of commutative k -algebras E with a homomorphism onto the k -algebra R whose kernel is the R -module M (with all pairs of elements in M having product 0). There are similar functors Exal and Exan for non-commutative rings and algebras, and functors Exaltop , Exantop . and Exalcotop that take a topology into account.  "Exalcomm" is an abbreviation for "COMMutative ALgebra EXtension" (or rather for the corresponding French phrase). It was introduced by .  Exalcomm is one of the André–Quillen cohomology groups and one of the Lichtenbaum–Schlessinger functors .  Given homomorphisms of commutative rings A → B → C and a C -module L there is an exact sequence of A -modules       0  →    Der  B    (  C  ,  L  )    →    Der  A    (  C  ,  L  )    →    Der  A    (  B  ,  L  )    →    Exalcomm  B    (  C  ,  L  )    →    Exalcomm  A    (  C  ,  L  )    →    Exalcomm  A    (  B  ,  L  )     ,       normal-→  0    subscript  Der  B   C  L     normal-→      subscript  Der  A   C  L     normal-→      subscript  Der  A   B  L     normal-→      subscript  Exalcomm  B   C  L     normal-→      subscript  Exalcomm  A   C  L     normal-→      subscript  Exalcomm  A   B  L      0\rightarrow\operatorname{Der}_{B}(C,L)\rightarrow\operatorname{Der}_{A}(C,L)%

 Exalcomm}_{A}(B,L),   where Der A ( B , L ) is the module of derivations of the A -algebra B with values in L . This sequence can be extended further to the right using André–Quillen cohomology .  References      "  Category:Homological algebra
