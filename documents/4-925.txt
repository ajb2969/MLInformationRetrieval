In mathematics, the butterfly lemma or Zassenhaus lemma, named after Hans Zassenhaus, is a technical result on the lattice of subgroups of a group or the lattice of submodules of a module, or more generally for any modular lattice.1
Lemma: Suppose 
 
 
 
  is a group with operators and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are subgroups. Suppose


 
  and 
 
 

are stable subgroups. Then,


 
  is isomorphic to 
 
 

Zassenhaus proved this lemma specifically to give the smoothest proof of the Schreier refinement theorem. The 'butterfly' becomes apparent when trying to draw the Hasse diagram of the various groups involved.
Zassenhaus' lemma for groups can be derived from a more general result known as Goursat's theorem stated in a Goursat variety (of which groups are an instance); however the group-specific modular law also needs to be used in the derivation.2
