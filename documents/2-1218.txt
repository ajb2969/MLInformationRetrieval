   Delta operator      Delta operator   In mathematics , a delta operator is a shift-equivariant linear operator     Q  :    ùïÇ   [  x  ]    ‚ü∂   ùïÇ   [  x  ]        normal-:  Q   normal-‚ü∂    ùïÇ   delimited-[]  x      ùïÇ   delimited-[]  x       Q\colon\mathbb{K}[x]\longrightarrow\mathbb{K}[x]    on the vector space of polynomials in a variable   x   x   x   over a field    ùïÇ   ùïÇ   \mathbb{K}   that reduces degrees by one.  To say that   Q   Q   Q   is shift-equivariant means that if     g   (  x  )    =   f   (   x  +  a   )          g  x     f    x  a      g(x)=f(x+a)   , then         (   Q  g   )    (  x  )    =    (   Q  f   )    (   x  +  a   )     .          Q  g   x       Q  f     x  a      {(Qg)(x)=(Qf)(x+a)}.\,     In other words, if    f   f   f    is a " shift " of    g   g   g    , then     Q  f      Q  f    Qf    is also a shift of     Q  g      Q  g    Qg    , and has the same " shifting vector "    a   a   a    .  To say that an operator reduces degree by one means that if    f   f   f    is a polynomial of degree    n   n   n    , then     Q  f      Q  f    Qf    is either a polynomial of degree    n  -  1      n  1    n-1   , or, in case    n  =  0      n  0    n=0   ,     Q  f      Q  f    Qf    is 0.  Sometimes a delta operator is defined to be a shift-equivariant linear transformation on polynomials in    x   x   x    that maps    x   x   x    to a nonzero constant. Seemingly weaker than the definition given above, this latter characterization can be shown to be equivalent to the stated definition, since shift-equivariance is a fairly strong condition.  Examples   The forward difference operator           (   Œî  f   )    (  x  )    =    f   (   x  +  1   )    -   f   (  x  )             normal-Œî  f   x       f    x  1      f  x      (\Delta f)(x)=f(x+1)-f(x)\,         is a delta operator.    Differentiation with respect to x , written as D , is also a delta operator.    Any operator of the form          ‚àë   k  =  1   ‚àû     c  k    D  k        superscript   subscript     k  1         subscript  c  k    superscript  D  k      \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}c_{k}D^{k}       (where D n (∆í) = ∆í ( n ) is the n th derivative) with     c  1   ‚â†  0       subscript  c  1   0    c_{1}\neq 0   is a delta operator. It can be shown that all delta operators can be written in this form. For example, the difference operator given above can be expanded as      Œî  =    e  D   -  1   =    ‚àë   k  =  1   ‚àû     D  k    k  !      .        normal-Œî     superscript  e  D   1          superscript   subscript     k  1         superscript  D  k     k        \Delta=e^{D}-1=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{D^{k}}{k!}.        The generalized derivative of time scale calculus which unifies the forward difference operator with the derivative of standard calculus is a delta operator.    In computer science and cybernetics , the term "discrete-time delta operator" (Œ¥) is generally taken to mean a difference operator            (   Œ¥  f   )    (  x  )    =     f   (   x  +   Œî  t    )    -   f   (  x  )      Œî  t     ,          Œ¥  f   x         f    x    normal-Œî  t       f  x      normal-Œî  t      {(\delta f)(x)={{f(x+\Delta t)-f(x)}\over{\Delta t}}},         the Euler approximation of the usual derivative with a discrete sample time    Œî  t      normal-Œî  t    \Delta t   . The delta-formulation obtains a significant number of numerical advantages compared to the shift-operator at fast sampling.   Basic polynomials  Every delta operator    Q   Q   Q    has a unique sequence of "basic polynomials", a polynomial sequence defined by three conditions:          p  0    (  x  )    =  1   ;         subscript  p  0   x   1    p_{0}(x)=1;            p  n    (  0  )    =  0   ;         subscript  p  n   0   0    p_{n}(0)=0;             (   Q   p  n    )    (  x  )    =   n   p   n  -  1     (  x  )     ,    ‚àÄ  n   ‚àà  ‚Ñï    .     formulae-sequence        Q   subscript  p  n    x     n   subscript  p    n  1    x       for-all  n   ‚Ñï     (Qp_{n})(x)=np_{n-1}(x),\;\forall n\in\mathbb{N}.      Such a sequence of basic polynomials is always of binomial type , and it can be shown that no other sequences of binomial type exist. If the first two conditions above are dropped, then the third condition says this polynomial sequence is a Sheffer sequence ‚Äîa more general concept.
