   Length constant      Length constant   In neurobiology , the length constant ( λ ) is a mathematical constant used to quantify the distance that a graded  electric potential will travel along a neurite via passive electrical conduction. The greater the value of the length constant, the further the potential will travel. A large length constant can contribute to spatial summation —the electrical addition of one potential with potentials from adjacent areas of the cell.  The length constant can be defined as:       λ   =     r  m    (    r  i   +   r  o    )         λ       subscript  r  m      subscript  r  i    subscript  r  o        \lambda\ =\ \sqrt{\frac{r_{m}}{(r_{i}+r_{o})}}     where r m is the membrane resistance (the force that impedes the flow of electric current from the outside of the membrane to the inside, and vice versa), r i is the axial resistance (the force that impedes current flow through the axoplasm , parallel to the membrane), and r o is the extracellular resistance (the force that impedes current flow through the extracellular fluid, parallel to the membrane). In calculation, the effects of r o are negligible, so the equation is typically expressed as:       λ   =     r  m    r  i         λ       subscript  r  m    subscript  r  i       \lambda\ =\ \sqrt{\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}}}     The membrane resistance is a function of the number of open ion channels , and the axial resistance is generally a function of the diameter of the axon . The greater the diameter of the axon, the lower the r i .  The length constant is used to describe the rise of potential difference across the membrane       V   (  x  )    =    V   m  a  x     (   1  -   e   -   x  /  λ      )          V  x      subscript  V    m  a  x      1   superscript  e      x  λ         V(x)\ =\ V_{max}(1-e^{-x/\lambda})     The fall of voltage can be expressed as:       V   (  x  )    =    V   m  a  x     (   e   -   x  /  λ     )          V  x      subscript  V    m  a  x     superscript  e      x  λ        V(x)\ =\ V_{max}(e^{-x/\lambda})     Where voltage , V, is measured in millivolts, x is distance from the start of the potential (in millimeters), and λ is the length constant (in millimeters).  V max is defined as the maximum voltage attained in the action potential, where:        V   m  a  x     =    r  m   I        subscript  V    m  a  x       subscript  r  m   I     V_{max}\ =\ r_{m}I     where r m is the resistance across the membrane and I is the current flow.  Setting for x= λ for the rise of voltage sets V(x) equal to .63 V max . This means that the length constant is the distance at which 63% of V max has been reached during the rise of voltage.  Setting for x= λ for the fall of voltage sets V(x) equal to .37 V max , meaning that the length constant is the distance at which 37% of V max has been reached during the fall of voltage.  By resistivity  Expressed with resistivity rather than resistance, the constant λ is (with negligible r o ): 1      λ  =     r  ×   ρ  m     2  ×   ρ  i          λ        r   subscript  ρ  m      2   subscript  ρ  i        \lambda=\sqrt{\frac{r\times\rho_{m}}{2\times\rho_{i}}}     Where   r   r   r   is the radius of the neuron.  The radius and number 2 come from that:        ρ  m   =     r  m   ×  2   π  r        subscript  ρ  m        subscript  r  m   2   π  r     \rho_{m}=r_{m}\times 2\pi r          ρ  i   =     r  i   ×  π    r  2         subscript  ρ  i        subscript  r  i   π    superscript  r  2      \rho_{i}=r_{i}\times\pi r^{2}      Expressed in this way, it can be seen that the length constant increases with increasing radius of the neuron.
