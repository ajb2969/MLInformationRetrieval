   Salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase      Salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + salutaridinol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + 7-O-acetylsalutaridinol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and salutaridinol , whereas its two products are CoA and 7-O-acetylsalutaridinol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase . This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis i .
