Dimethylmaleate hydratase

In enzymology, a dimethylmaleate hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylmalate 
 
 
 
  dimethylmaleate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylmalate, and two products, dimethylmaleate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylmalate hydro-lyase (dimethylmaleate-forming). This enzyme is also called (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylmalate hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism. It employs one cofactor, iron.
