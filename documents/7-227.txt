Dual wavelet

In mathematics, a dual wavelet is the dual to a wavelet. In general, the wavelet series generated by a square integrable function will have a dual series, in the sense of the Riesz representation theorem. However, the dual series is not in general representable by a square integral function itself.
Definition
Given a square integrable function 
 
 
 
 , define the series 
 
 
 
  by



for integers 
 
 
 
 .
Such a function is called an R-function if the linear span of 
 
 
 
  is dense in 
 
 
 
 , and if there exist positive constants A, B with 
 
 

for all bi-infinite square summable series 
 
 
 
 . Here, 
 
 
 
  denotes the square-sum norm:



and 
 
 
 
  denotes the usual norm on 
 
 
 
 :



By the Riesz representation theorem, there exists a unique dual basis 
 
 
 
  such that



where 
 
 
 
  is the Kronecker delta and 
 
 
 
  is the usual inner product on 
 
 
 
 . Indeed, there exists a unique series representation for a square integrable function f expressed in this basis:



If there exists a function 
 
 
 
  such that



then 
 
 
 
  is called the dual wavelet or the wavelet dual to ψ. In general, for some given R-function ψ, the dual will not exist. In the special case of 
 
 
 
 , the wavelet is said to be an orthogonal wavelet.
An example of an R-function without a dual is easy to construct. Let 
 
 
 
  be an orthogonal wavelet. Then define $\psi(x) = \phi(x) + z\phi(2x)$ for some complex number z. It is straightforward to show that this ψ does not have a wavelet dual.
