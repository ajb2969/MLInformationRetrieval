   Malonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase      Malonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a malonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-oxopropanoate + NAD(P)+ + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   malonate + NAD(P)H + 2 H +    The 4 substrates of this enzyme are 3-oxopropanoate , NAD + , NADP + , and H 2 O , whereas its 4 products are malonate , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-oxopropanoate:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in beta-alanine metabolism .
