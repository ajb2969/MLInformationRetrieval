   23S rRNA (adenine2085-N6)-dimethyltransferase      23S rRNA (adenine2085-N6)-dimethyltransferase   23S rRNA (adenine 2085 -N 6 )-dimethyltransferase (, ''ErmC' methyltransferase, ermC methylase, ermC 23S rRNA methyltransferase, rRNA:m 6 A methyltransferase ErmC', ErmC', rRNA methyltransferase ErmC' '') is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (adenine 2085 -N 6 )-dimethyltransferase . 1 2 3 4 5 6 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine 2085 in 23S rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 6 - dimethyladenine 2085 in 23S rRNA   ErmC is a methyltransferase that confers resistance to the macrolide - lincosamide - streptogramin B group of antibiotics by catalysing the methylation of 23S rRNA at adenine 2085 .
