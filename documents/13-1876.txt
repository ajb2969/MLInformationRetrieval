   Triangle graph      Triangle graph   In the mathematical field of graph theory , the triangle graph is a planar  undirected graph with 3 vertices and 3 edges, in the form of a triangle. 1  The triangle graph is also known as the cycle graph     C  3     subscript  C  3    C_{3}   and the complete graph     K  3     subscript  K  3    K_{3}   .  Properties  The triangle graph has chromatic number 3, chromatic index 3, radius 1, diameter 1 and girth 3. It is also a 2- vertex-connected graph and a 2- edge-connected graph .  Its chromatic polynomial is     (   x  -  3   )    (   x  -  2   )   x        x  3     x  2   x    (x-3)(x-2)x     See also   Triangle-free graph   References  "  Category:Individual graphs  Category:Regular graphs     â†©
