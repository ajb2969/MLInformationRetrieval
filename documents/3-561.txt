   Connection (vector bundle)      Connection (vector bundle)   In mathematics , a connection on a fiber bundle is a device that defines a notion of parallel transport on the bundle; that is, a way to "connect" or identify fibers over nearby points. If the fiber bundle is a vector bundle , then the notion of parallel transport must be linear . Such a connection is equivalently specified by a covariant derivative , which is an operator that can differentiate sections of that bundle along tangent directions in the base manifold. Connections in this sense generalize, to arbitrary vector bundles, the concept of a linear connection on the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold , and are sometimes known as linear connections . Nonlinear connections are connections that are not necessarily linear in this sense.  Connections on vector bundles are also sometimes called Koszul connections after Jean-Louis Koszul , who gave an algebraic framework for describing them .  Formal definition  Let E → M be a smooth vector bundle over a differentiable manifold  M . Denote the space of smooth sections of E by Γ( E ). A connection on E is an ℝ- linear map      ∇  :    Γ   (  E  )    →   Γ   (    E  ⊗   T  *    M   )        normal-:  normal-∇   normal-→    normal-Γ  E     normal-Γ     tensor-product  E   superscript  T     M       \nabla:\Gamma(E)\to\Gamma(E\otimes T^{*}M)   such that the Leibniz rule       ∇   (   σ  f   )    =     (   ∇  σ   )   f   +    σ  ⊗  d   f         normal-∇    σ  f         normal-∇  σ   f      tensor-product  σ  d   f      \nabla(\sigma f)=(\nabla\sigma)f+\sigma\otimes df   holds for all smooth functions  f on M and all smooth sections σ of E .  If X is a tangent vector field on M (i.e. a section of the tangent bundle  TM ) one can define a covariant derivative along X       ∇  X   :    Γ   (  E  )    →   Γ   (  E  )        normal-:   subscript  normal-∇  X    normal-→    normal-Γ  E     normal-Γ  E      \nabla_{X}:\Gamma(E)\to\Gamma(E)   by contracting X with the resulting covariant index in the connection ∇ (i.e. ∇ X σ = (∇σ)( X )). The covariant derivative satisfies the following properties:        ∇  X    (    σ  1   +   σ  2    )    =     ∇  X    σ  1    +    ∇  X    σ  2           subscript  normal-∇  X      subscript  σ  1    subscript  σ  2         subscript  normal-∇  X    subscript  σ  1      subscript  normal-∇  X    subscript  σ  2       \displaystyle\nabla_{X}(\sigma_{1}+\sigma_{2})=\nabla_{X}\sigma_{1}+\nabla_{X}%
 \sigma_{2}   Conversely, any operator satisfying the above properties defines a connection on E and a connection in this sense is also known as a covariant derivative on E .  Vector-valued forms  Let E → M be a vector bundle. An E -valued differential form of degree r is a section of the tensor product bundle E ⊗ Λ r T * M . The space of such forms is denoted by         Ω  r    (  E  )    =   Γ   (   E  ⊗     ⋀  r      T  *   M     )     .         superscript  normal-Ω  r   E     normal-Γ   tensor-product  E    superscript   r      superscript  T    M        \Omega^{r}(E)=\Gamma(E\otimes\textstyle\bigwedge^{r}T^{*}M).   An E -valued 0-form is just a section of the bundle E . That is,         Ω  0    (  E  )    =   Γ   (  E  )     .         superscript  normal-Ω  0   E     normal-Γ  E     \Omega^{0}(E)=\Gamma(E).\,     In this notation a connection on E → M is a linear map       ∇  :     Ω  0    (  E  )    →    Ω  1    (  E  )      .     normal-:  normal-∇   normal-→     superscript  normal-Ω  0   E      superscript  normal-Ω  1   E      \nabla:\Omega^{0}(E)\to\Omega^{1}(E).   A connection may then be viewed as a generalization of the exterior derivative to vector bundle valued forms. In fact, given a connection ∇ on E there is a unique way to extend ∇ to a covariant exterior derivative or exterior covariant derivative        d  ∇   :     Ω  r    (  E  )    →    Ω   r  +  1     (  E  )      .     normal-:   superscript  d  normal-∇    normal-→     superscript  normal-Ω  r   E      superscript  normal-Ω    r  1    E      d^{\nabla}:\Omega^{r}(E)\to\Omega^{r+1}(E).   Unlike the ordinary exterior derivative one need not have ( d ∇ ) 2 = 0. In fact, ( d ∇ ) 2 is directly related to the curvature of the connection ∇ (see below ).  Affine properties  Every vector bundle admits a connection. However, connections are not unique. If ∇ 1 and ∇ 2 are two connections on E → M then their difference is a C ∞ -linear operator. That is,        (    ∇  1   -   ∇  2    )    (   f  σ   )    =   f   (     ∇  1   σ   -    ∇  2   σ    )             subscript  normal-∇  1    subscript  normal-∇  2      f  σ      f      subscript  normal-∇  1   σ     subscript  normal-∇  2   σ       (\nabla_{1}-\nabla_{2})(f\sigma)=f(\nabla_{1}\sigma-\nabla_{2}\sigma)   for all smooth functions f on M and all smooth sections σ of E . It follows that the difference ∇ 1 − ∇ 2 is induced by a one-form on M with values in the endomorphism bundle End( E ) = E E *:        (    ∇  1   -   ∇  2    )   ∈    Ω  1    (  M  ;    End   E   )     .         subscript  normal-∇  1    subscript  normal-∇  2       superscript  normal-Ω  1    M    End  E       (\nabla_{1}-\nabla_{2})\in\Omega^{1}(M;\mathrm{End}\,E).   Conversely, if ∇ is a connection on E and A is a one-form on M with values in End( E ), then ∇+ A is a connection on E .  In other words, the space of connections on E is an affine space for Ω 1 (End E ).  Relation to principal and Ehresmann connections  Let E → M be a vector bundle of rank k and let F( E ) be the principal  frame bundle of E . Then a (principal) connection on F( E ) induces a connection on E . First note that sections of E are in one-to-one correspondence with right-equivariant maps F( E ) → R k . (This can be seen by considering the pullback of E over F( E ) → M , which is isomorphic to the trivial bundle F( E ) × R k .) Given a section σ of E let the corresponding equivariant map be ψ(σ). The covariant derivative on E is then given by       ψ   (    ∇  X   σ   )    =    X  H    (   ψ   (  σ  )    )          ψ    subscript  normal-∇  X   σ       superscript  X  H     ψ  σ      \psi(\nabla_{X}\sigma)=X^{H}(\psi(\sigma))   where X H is the horizontal lift of X (recall that the horizontal lift is determined by the connection on F( E )).  Conversely, a connection on E determines a connection on F( E ), and these two constructions are mutually inverse.  A connection on E is also determined equivalently by a linear Ehresmann connection on E . This provides one method to construct the associated principal connection.  Local expression  Let E → M be a vector bundle of rank k , and let U be an open subset of M over which E is trivial. Given a local smooth frame ( e 1 , …, e k ) of E over U , any section σ of E can be written as    σ  =    σ  α    e  α        σ     superscript  σ  α    subscript  e  α      \sigma=\sigma^{\alpha}e_{\alpha}   ( Einstein notation assumed). A connection on E restricted to U then takes the form       ∇  σ   =    (    d   σ  α    +     ω  α     σ   β   β      )    e  α         normal-∇  σ         normal-d   superscript  σ  α       superscript  ω  α    subscript   superscript  σ  β   β      subscript  e  α      \nabla\sigma=(\mathrm{d}\sigma^{\alpha}+\omega^{\alpha}\!{}_{\beta}\sigma^{%
 \beta})e_{\alpha}   where          ω  α     e  α    β     =   ∇   e  β     .         superscript  ω  α    subscript   subscript  e  α   β     normal-∇   subscript  e  β      \omega^{\alpha}\!{}_{\beta}\,e_{\alpha}=\nabla e_{\beta}.   Here ω α β defines a k × k matrix of one-forms on U . In fact, given any such matrix the above expression defines a connection on E restricted to U . This is because ω α β determines a one-form ω with values in End( E ) and this expression defines ∇ to be the connection d+ω, where d is the trivial connection on E over U defined by differentiating the components of a section using the local frame. In this context ω is sometimes called the connection form of ∇ with respect to the local frame.  If U is a coordinate neighborhood with coordinates ( x i ) then we can write        ω  α     =   β      ω  i    α     d   β     x  i   .     fragments   superscript  ω  α    subscript   β    superscript   subscript  ω  i   α    subscript  normal-d  β    superscript  x  i   normal-.    \omega^{\alpha}\!{}_{\beta}={\omega_{i}}^{\alpha}\!{}_{\beta}\,\mathrm{d}x^{i}.   Note the mixture of coordinate and fiber indices in this expression. The coefficient functions ω i α β are tensorial in the index i (they define a one-form) but not in the indices α and β. The transformation law for the fiber indices is more complicated. Let ( f 1 , …, f k ) be another smooth local frame over U and let the change of coordinate matrix be denoted t (i.e. f α = e β t β α ). The connection matrix with respect to frame ( f α ) is then given by the matrix expression       ϖ  =     t   -  1    ω  t   +    t   -  1    d  t     .      ϖ       superscript  t    1    ω  t      superscript  t    1    normal-d  t      \varpi=t^{-1}\omega t+t^{-1}\mathrm{d}t.     Here d t is the matrix of one-forms obtained by taking the exterior derivative of the components of t .  The covariant derivative in the local coordinates and with respect to the local frame field ( e α ) is given by the expression         ∇  X   σ   =    X  i    (      ∂  i     σ  α    +     ω  i    α     σ   β   β      )    e  α     .        subscript  normal-∇  X   σ      superscript  X  i       subscript   i    superscript  σ  α       superscript   subscript  ω  i   α    subscript   superscript  σ  β   β      subscript  e  α      \nabla_{X}\sigma=X^{i}(\partial_{i}\,\sigma^{\alpha}+{\omega_{i}}^{\alpha}\!{}%
 _{\beta}\sigma^{\beta})e_{\alpha}.     Parallel transport and holonomy  A connection ∇ on a vector bundle E → M defines a notion of parallel transport on E along a curve in M . Let γ : [0, 1] → M be a smooth path in M . A section σ of E along γ is said to be parallel if        ∇    γ  ˙    (  t  )     σ   =  0        subscript  normal-∇     normal-˙  γ   t    σ   0    \nabla_{\dot{\gamma}(t)}\sigma=0   for all t ∈ [0, 1]. More formally, one can consider the pullback bundle γ* E of E by γ. This is a vector bundle over [0, 1] with fiber E γ( t ) over t ∈ [0, 1]. The connection ∇ on E pulls back to a connection on γ* E . A section σ of γ* E is parallel if and only if γ*∇(σ) = 0.  Suppose γ is a path from x to y in M . The above equation defining parallel sections is a first-order ordinary differential equation (cf. local expression above) and so has a unique solution for each possible initial condition. That is, for each vector v in E x there exists a unique parallel section σ of γ* E with σ(0) = v . Define a parallel transport map       τ  γ   :    E  x   →    E  y        normal-:   subscript  τ  γ    normal-→   subscript  E  x    subscript  E  y      \tau_{\gamma}:E_{x}\to E_{y}\,   by τ γ ( v ) = σ(1). It can be shown that τ γ is a linear isomorphism .  Parallel transport can be used to define the holonomy group of the connection ∇ based at a point x in M . This is the subgroup of GL( E x ) consisting of all parallel transport maps coming from loops based at x :        Hol  x   =   {   τ  γ   :   γ  is a loop based at  x   }    .       subscript  Hol  x    conditional-set   subscript  τ  γ     γ  is a loop based at  x      \mathrm{Hol}_{x}=\{\tau_{\gamma}:\gamma\text{ is a loop based at }x\}.\,   The holonomy group of a connection is intimately related to the curvature of the connection .  Curvature  The curvature of a connection ∇ on E → M is a 2-form F ∇ on M with values in the endomorphism bundle End( E ) = E E *. That is,        F  ∇   ∈    Ω  2    (    End   E   )    =   Γ   (      End   E   ⊗   Λ  2     T  *   M   )     .         superscript  F  normal-∇      superscript  normal-Ω  2     End  E           normal-Γ     tensor-product    End  E    superscript  normal-Λ  2     superscript  T    M       F^{\nabla}\in\Omega^{2}(\mathrm{End}\,E)=\Gamma(\mathrm{End}\,E\otimes\Lambda^%
 {2}T^{*}M).   It is defined by the expression        F  ∇    (  X  ,  Y  )    (  s  )    =      ∇  X    ∇  Y    s   -     ∇  Y    ∇  X    s   -    ∇   [  X  ,  Y  ]    s           superscript  F  normal-∇    X  Y   s        subscript  normal-∇  X    subscript  normal-∇  Y    s      subscript  normal-∇  Y    subscript  normal-∇  X    s     subscript  normal-∇   X  Y    s      F^{\nabla}(X,Y)(s)=\nabla_{X}\nabla_{Y}s-\nabla_{Y}\nabla_{X}s-\nabla_{[X,Y]}s   where X and Y are tangent vector fields on M and s is a section of E . One must check that F ∇ is C ∞ -linear in both X and Y and that it does in fact define a bundle endomorphism of E .  As mentioned above , the covariant exterior derivative d ∇ need not square to zero when acting on E -valued forms. The operator ( d ∇ ) 2 is, however, strictly tensorial (i.e. C ∞ -linear). This implies that it is induced from a 2-form with values in End( E ). This 2-form is precisely the curvature form given above. For an E -valued form σ we have          (   d  ∇   )   2   σ   =    F  ∇   ∧  σ    .         superscript   superscript  d  normal-∇   2   σ      superscript  F  normal-∇   σ     (d^{\nabla})^{2}\sigma=F^{\nabla}\wedge\sigma.     A flat connection is one whose curvature form vanishes identically.  Examples   A classical covariant derivative or affine connection defines a connection on the tangent bundle of M , or more generally on any tensor bundle formed by taking tensor products of the tangent bundle with itself and its dual.  The Levi-Civita connection is a connection on the tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold .  The exterior derivative is a flat connection on E = M × R (the trivial line bundle over M ).  More generally, there is a canonical flat connection on any flat vector bundle (i.e. a vector bundle whose transition functions are all constant) which is given by the exterior derivative in any trivialization.
