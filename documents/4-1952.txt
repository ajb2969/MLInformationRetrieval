   Plücker embedding      Plücker embedding   In mathematics, the Plücker embedding describes a method to realize the Grassmannian of all r -dimensional subspaces of an n -dimensional vector space  V as a subvariety of the projective space of the r th exterior power of that vector space, P (∧ r  V ).  The Plücker embedding was first defined, in the case r = 2, n = 4, in coordinates by Julius Plücker as a way of describing the lines in three-dimensional space (which, as projective lines in real projective space, correspond to two-dimensional subspaces of a four-dimensional vector space). This was generalized by Hermann Grassmann to arbitrary r and n using a generalization of Plücker's coordinates, sometimes called Grassmann coordinates .  Definition  The Plücker embedding (over the field K ) is the map ι defined by      ι  :   𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,   K  n   )       normal-:  ι    𝐆𝐫   r   superscript  K  n       \displaystyle\iota\colon\mathbf{Gr}(r,K^{n})     where Gr ( r , K n ) is the Grassmannian , i.e., the space of all r -dimensional subspaces of the n -dimensional vector space , K n .  This is an isomorphism from the Grassmannian to the image of ι , which is a projective variety. This variety can be completely characterized as an intersection of quadrics, each coming from a relation on the Plücker (or Grassmann) coordinates that derives from linear algebra.  The bracket ring appears as the ring of polynomial functions on the exterior power. 1  Plücker Relations  The embedding of the Grassmannian satisfies some very simple quadratic polynomials called the Plücker relations . These show that the Grassmannian embeds as an algebraic subvariety of and give another method of constructing the Grassmannian. To state the Plücker relations, choose two   r   r   r   -dimensional subspaces   W   W   W   and   Z   Z   Z   of   V   V   V   with bases  and  respectively. Then, for any integer    k  ≥  0      k  normal-≥  0    k≥0   , the following equation is true in the homogeneous coordinate ring of :          ψ   (  W  )    ⋅  ψ    (  Z  )    -    ∑    i  1   <  ⋯  <   i  k       (    v  1   ∧  ⋯  ∧   v    i  1   -  1    ∧   w  1   ∧   v    i  1   +  1    ∧  ⋯  ∧   v    i  k   -  1    ∧   w  k   ∧   v    i  k   +  1    ∧  ⋯  ∧   v  r    )   ⋅   (    v   i  1    ∧  ⋯  ∧   v   i  k    ∧    w   k  +  1    ⋯   ∧   w  r    )      =  0.           normal-⋅    ψ  W   ψ   Z     subscript        subscript  i  1   normal-⋯        subscript  i  k       normal-⋅     subscript  v  1   normal-⋯   subscript  v     subscript  i  1   1     subscript  w  1    subscript  v     subscript  i  1   1    normal-⋯   subscript  v     subscript  i  k   1     subscript  w  k    subscript  v     subscript  i  k   1    normal-⋯   subscript  v  r       subscript  v   subscript  i  1    normal-⋯   subscript  v   subscript  i  k       subscript  w    k  1    normal-⋯    subscript  w  r       0.    \psi(W)\cdot\psi(Z)-\sum_{i_{1}<\cdots     When     d  i  m   (  V  )    =  4        d  i  m  V   4    dim(V)=4   , and    r  =  2      r  2    r=2   , the simplest Grassmannian which is not a projective space, the above reduces to a single equation. Denoting the coordinates of by , we have that    𝐆𝐫   (  2  ,  V  )       𝐆𝐫   2  V     \mathbf{Gr}(2,V)   is defined by the equation   0.}}    In general, however, many more equations are needed to define the Plücker embedding of a Grassmannian in projective space.
