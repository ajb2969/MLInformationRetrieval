<h1>Celsius</h1>
<hr/>

<p> <strong>Celsius</strong>, historically known as <strong>centigrade</strong>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> is a scale and <a href="unit_of_measurement" title="wikilink">unit of measurement</a> for <a class="uri" href="temperature" title="wikilink">temperature</a>. It is named after the <a href="Sweden" title="wikilink">Swedish</a> <a class="uri" href="astronomer" title="wikilink">astronomer</a> <a href="Anders_Celsius" title="wikilink">Anders Celsius</a> (1701–1744), who developed a similar temperature scale. The <strong>degree Celsius</strong> (<strong>°C</strong>) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature <a href="Interval_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">interval</a>, a difference between two temperatures or an <a class="uri" href="uncertainty" title="wikilink">uncertainty</a>. Before being renamed to honor Anders Celsius in 1948, the unit was called <em>centigrade</em>, from the Latin <em>centum</em>, which means 100, and <em>gradus</em>, which means steps.</p>

<p>From 1744 until 1954, 0 °C was defined as the <a href="freezing_point" title="wikilink">freezing point</a> of <a class="uri" href="water" title="wikilink">water</a> and 100 °C was defined as the <a href="boiling_point" title="wikilink">boiling point</a> of water, both at a pressure of one <a href="Atmosphere_(unit)" title="wikilink">standard atmosphere</a> with <a href="mercury_(element)" title="wikilink">mercury</a> being the working material. Although these defining correlations are commonly taught in schools today, by international agreement the unit "degree Celsius" and the Celsius scale are currently defined by two different temperatures: <a href="absolute_zero" title="wikilink">absolute zero</a>, and the <a href="triple_point" title="wikilink">triple point</a> of <a href="Vienna_Standard_Mean_Ocean_Water" title="wikilink">VSMOW</a> (specially purified water). This definition also precisely relates the Celsius scale to the <a class="uri" href="Kelvin" title="wikilink">Kelvin</a> scale, which defines the <a href="SI_base_unit" title="wikilink">SI base unit</a> of <a href="thermodynamic_temperature" title="wikilink">thermodynamic temperature</a> with symbol K. Absolute zero, the lowest temperature possible, is defined as being precisely 0 K and −273.15 °C. The temperature of the triple point of water is defined as precisely 273.16 K and 0.01 °C.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>This definition fixes the magnitude of both the degree Celsius and the Kelvin as precisely 1 part in 273.16 (approximately 0.00366) of the difference between absolute zero and the triple point of water. Thus, it sets the magnitude of one degree Celsius and that of one Kelvin as exactly the same. Additionally, it establishes the difference between the two scales' null points as being precisely 273.15 degrees Celsius ( and ).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p> In 1742, Swedish astronomer <a href="Anders_Celsius" title="wikilink">Anders Celsius</a> (1701–1744) created a temperature scale which was <em>the reverse</em> of the scale now known by the name "Celsius": <em>0</em> represented the boiling point of water, while <em>100</em> represented the freezing point of water. In his paper <em>Observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer</em>, he recounted his experiments showing that the melting point of ice is essentially unaffected by pressure. He also determined with remarkable precision how the boiling point of water varied as a function of atmospheric pressure. He proposed that the zero point of his temperature scale, being the boiling point, would be calibrated at the mean barometric pressure at mean sea level. This pressure is known as one <a href="Atmosphere_(unit)" title="wikilink">standard atmosphere</a>. The <a class="uri" href="BIPM" title="wikilink">BIPM</a>'s 10th <a href="General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures" title="wikilink">General Conference on Weights and Measures</a> (CGPM) later defined one standard atmosphere to equal precisely  per <a href="square_centimetre" title="wikilink">square centimetre</a> (101.325 <a class="uri" href="kPa" title="wikilink">kPa</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1743, the <a href="Lyon" title="wikilink">Lyonnais</a> physicist <a href="Jean-Pierre_Christin" title="wikilink">Jean-Pierre Christin</a>, permanent secretary of the <em>Académie des sciences, belles-lettres et arts de Lyon</em><sup><a href=":fr:Académie_des_sciences,_belles-lettres_et_arts_de_Lyon" title="wikilink">FR</a></sup>, working independently of Celsius, developed a scale where zero represented the freezing point of water and 100 represented the boiling point of water.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> On 19 May 1743 he published the design of a <a href="mercury_thermometer" title="wikilink">mercury thermometer</a>, the "Thermometer of Lyon" built by the craftsman Pierre Casati that used this scale.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1744, coincident with the death of Anders Celsius, the Swedish botanist <a href="Carolus_Linnaeus" title="wikilink">Carolus Linnaeus</a> (1707–1778) reversed Celsius's scale.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> His custom-made "linnaeus-thermometer", for use in his greenhouses, was made by Daniel Ekström, Sweden's leading maker of scientific instruments at the time and whose workshop was located in the basement of the Stockholm observatory. As often happened in this age before modern communications, numerous physicists, scientists, and instrument makers are credited with having independently developed this same scale;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> among them were Pehr Elvius, the secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (which had an instrument workshop) and with whom Linnaeus had been corresponding; Daniel Ekström<sup><a href=":sv:Daniel_Ekström" title="wikilink">[SV</a>]</sup>, the instrument maker; and Mårten Strömer (1707–1770) who had studied astronomy under Anders Celsius.</p>

<p>The first known Swedish document<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> reporting temperatures in this modern "forward" Celsius scale is the paper <em>Hortus Upsaliensis</em> dated 16 December 1745 that Linnaeus wrote to a student of his, Samuel Nauclér. In it, Linnaeus recounted the temperatures inside the orangery at the Botanical Garden of Uppsala University: </p>
<h3 id="centigrade-and-celsius">Centigrade and Celsius</h3>

<p>Since the 19th century, the scientific and <a class="uri" href="thermometry" title="wikilink">thermometry</a> communities worldwide referred to this scale as the centigrade scale. Temperatures on the centigrade scale were often reported simply as <em>degrees</em> or, when greater specificity was desired, as <em>degrees centigrade</em>. The symbol for temperature values on this scale is °C.</p>

<p>Because the term <em>centigrade</em> was also the Spanish and French language name for a unit of angular measurement (1/100 of a right angle) and had a similar connotation in other languages, the term <em>centesimal degree</em> was used when very precise, unambiguous language was required by international standards bodies such as the <a href="International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures" title="wikilink">BIPM</a>. The 9th <a href="General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures" title="wikilink">CGPM</a> and the CIPM (<a href="International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures" title="wikilink">Comité international des poids et mesures</a>) formally adopted "degree Celsius" (symbol: °C) in 1948.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><ref name="OED 1">According to <em>The Oxford English Dictionary</em> (OED), the term "Celsius' thermometer" had been used at least as early as 1797. Further, the term "The Celsius or Centigrade thermometer" was again used in reference to a particular type of thermometer at least as early as 1850. The OED also cites this 1928 reporting of a temperature: "My altitude was about 5,800 metres, the temperature was 28° Celsius." However, dictionaries seek to find the earliest use of a word or term and are not a useful resource as regards to the terminology used throughout the history of science. According to several writings of Dr. Terry Quinn CBE FRS, Director of the BIPM (1988–2004), including <em>Temperature Scales from the early days of thermometry to the 21st century</em> () as well as <em>Temperature</em> (2nd Edition/1990/Academic Press/0125696817), the term <em>Celsius</em> in connection with the centigrade scale was not used whatsoever by the scientific or thermometry communities until after the CIPM and CGPM adopted the term in 1948. The BIPM was not even aware that "degree Celsius" was in sporadic, non-scientific use before that time. It is also noteworthy that the twelve-volume, 1933 edition of OED didn't even have a listing for the word <em>Celsius</em> (but did have listings for both <em>centigrade</em> and <em>centesimal</em> in the context of temperature measurement). The 1948 adoption of <em>Celsius</em> accomplished three objectives:</ref></p>
<dl>
<dd>1.    All common temperature scales would have their units named after someone closely associated with them; namely, Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit, Réaumur and Rankine.
</dd>
<dd>2.    Notwithstanding the important contribution of Linnaeus who gave the Celsius scale its modern form, Celsius' name was the obvious choice because it began with the letter C. Thus, the symbol °C that for centuries had been used in association with the name <em>centigrade</em> could continue to be used and would simultaneously inherit an intuitive association with the new name.
</dd>
<dd>3.    The new name eliminated the ambiguity of the term "centigrade", freeing it to refer exclusively to the French-language name for the unit of angular measurement.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>It was not until February 1985 that the <a href="BBC_Weather" title="wikilink">forecasts issued by the BBC</a> switched from "centigrade" to "Celsius".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>For scientific use, "Celsius" is the term usually used, with "centigrade" otherwise continuing to be in common but decreasing use, especially in informal contexts in English-speaking countries.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>The "degree Celsius" has been the only SI unit whose full unit name contains an uppercase letter since the <a href="SI_base_unit" title="wikilink">SI base unit</a> for temperature, the kelvin, became the proper name in 1967 replacing the term <em>degree Kelvin</em>. The plural form is <em>degrees Celsius</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>The general rule of the <a href="International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures" title="wikilink">International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM)</a> is that the numerical value always precedes the unit, and a space is always used to separate the unit from the number,  (not "" or "").<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Thus the value of the quantity is the product of the number and the unit, the space being regarded as a multiplication sign (just as a space between units implies multiplication). The only exceptions to this rule are for the unit <a href="Degree_symbol" title="wikilink">symbols for degree</a>, minute, and second for plane angle (°, ′, and ″, respectively), for which no space is left between the numerical value and the unit symbol.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Other languages, and various publishing houses, may follow different typographical rules.</p>
<h3 id="unicode-character">Unicode character</h3>

<p>In normal use, it is best to represent degrees Celsius "°C" with a sequence of  followed by , rather than .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> However, <a class="uri" href="Unicode" title="wikilink">Unicode</a> provides a <a href="Unicode_compatibility_characters" title="wikilink">compatibility character</a> for the degree Celsius at U+2103 (decimal 8451), for compatibility with <a class="uri" href="CJK" title="wikilink">CJK</a> encodings that provide such a character (as such, in most fonts the width is the same as for <a class="uri" href="fullwidth" title="wikilink">fullwidth</a> characters).

<h2 id="temperatures-and-intervals">Temperatures and intervals</h2>

<p>The degree Celsius is a special name for the kelvin for use in expressing Celsius temperatures.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The degree Celsius is also subject to the same rules as the kelvin with regard to the use of its unit name and symbol. Thus, besides expressing specific temperatures along its scale (e.g. "<a class="uri" href="Gallium" title="wikilink">Gallium</a> melts at 29.7646 °C" and "The temperature outside is 23 degrees Celsius"), the degree Celsius is also suitable for expressing temperature <em>intervals</em>: differences between temperatures or their uncertainties (e.g. "The output of the heat exchanger is hotter by 40 degrees Celsius", and "Our standard uncertainty is ±3 °C").<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Because of this dual usage, one must not rely upon the unit name or its symbol to denote that a quantity is a temperature interval; it must be unambiguous through context or explicit statement that the quantity is an interval.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> This is sometimes solved by using the symbol °C (pronounced "degrees Celsius") for a temperature, and C° (pronounced "Celsius degrees") for a temperature interval, although this usage is non-standard.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>What is often confusing about the Celsius measurement is that it follows an interval system but not a ratio system; that it follows a relative scale not an absolute scale. This is put simply by illustrating that while 10 °C and 20 °C have the same interval difference as 20 °C and 30 °C the temperature 20 °C is not twice the air heat energy as 10 °C. As this example shows, degrees Celsius is a useful interval measurement but does not possess the characteristics of ratio measures like weight or distance.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="coexistence-of-kelvin-and-celsius-scales">Coexistence of Kelvin and Celsius scales</h2>

<p>In science and in engineering, the Celsius scale and the Kelvin scale are often used in combination in close contexts, e.g. "...a measured value was 0.01023 °C with an uncertainty of 70 µK...". This practice is permissible because the magnitude of the degree Celsius is equal to that of the kelvin.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the official endorsement provided by decision <a href="http://www.bipm.fr/en/CGPM/db/13/3/">#3 of Resolution 3 of the 13th CGPM</a>, which stated "a temperature interval may also be expressed in degrees Celsius", the practice of simultaneously using both °C and K remains widespread throughout the scientific world as the use of <a href="Metric_prefix#List_of_SI_prefixes" title="wikilink">SI-prefixed</a> forms of the degree Celsius (such as "µ°C" or "microdegrees Celsius") to express a temperature interval has not been well-adopted.</p>
<h2 id="melting-and-boiling-points-of-water">Melting and boiling points of water</h2>

<p>One effect of defining the Celsius scale at the <a href="triple_point" title="wikilink">triple point</a> of <a href="Vienna_Standard_Mean_Ocean_Water" title="wikilink">Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water</a> (<a class="uri" href="VSMOW" title="wikilink">VSMOW</a>, 273.16 K and 0.01 °C), and at <a href="absolute_zero" title="wikilink">absolute zero</a> (0 K and −273.15 °C), is that neither the <a href="Water_(properties)" title="wikilink">melting</a> nor <a href="Water_(properties)" title="wikilink">boiling</a> point of water under one standard atmosphere (101.325 kPa) remains a defining point for the Celsius scale. In 1948 when the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures (<a class="uri" href="CGPM" title="wikilink">CGPM</a>) in Resolution 3 first considered using the triple point of water as a defining point, the triple point was so close to being 0.01 °C greater than water's known melting point, it was simply defined as precisely 0.01 °C.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> However, current measurements show that the difference between the triple and melting points of VSMOW is actually very slightly (\textstyle\frac{373.15}{273.15} (approximately 36.61% thermodynamically hotter). When adhering <em>strictly</em> to the two-point definition for calibration, the boiling point of VSMOW under one standard atmosphere of pressure is actually 373.1339 K (99.9839 °C). When calibrated to <a href="International_Temperature_Scale_of_1990" title="wikilink">ITS-90</a> (a calibration standard comprising many definition points and commonly used for high-precision instrumentation), the boiling point of VSMOW is slightly less, about 99.974 °C.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>This boiling-point difference of 16.1 millikelvin between the Celsius scale's original definition and the current one (based on absolute zero and the triple point) has little practical meaning in common daily applications because water's boiling point is very sensitive to variations in barometric pressure. For example, an altitude change of only 28 cm (11 in) causes the boiling point to change by one millikelvin. </p>

Older definitions of the Celsius scale once defined the boiling point of water under one standard atmosphere as being precisely 100 °C.

<li id="fn26">In 1948, <a href="http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/9/7">Resolution 7 of the 9th CGPM</a> stated, <span style="color:#721F01;">"To indicate a temperature interval or difference, rather than a temperature, the word 'degree' in full, or the abbreviation 'deg' must be used."</span> This resolution was abrogated in 1967/1968 by <a href="http://www.bipm.fr/en/CGPM/db/13/3/">Resolution 3 of the 13th CGPM</a> which stated that <span style="color:#721F01;">["The names "degree Kelvin" and "degree", the symbols "°K" and "deg" and the rules for their use given in Resolution 7 of the 9th CGPM (1948),] ...and the designation of the unit to express an interval or a difference of temperatures are abrogated, but the usages which derive from these decisions remain permissible for the time being."</span> Consequently, there is now wide freedom in usage regarding how to indicate a temperature interval. The most important thing is that one's intention must be clear and the basic rule of the SI must be followed; namely that the unit name or its symbol must not be relied upon to indicate the nature of the quantity. Thus, if a temperature interval is, say, 10 K or 10 °C (which may be written 10 kelvin or 10 degrees Celsius), it must be unambiguous through obvious context or explicit statement that the quantity is an interval. Rules governing the expressing of temperatures and intervals are covered in the BIPM's <em>SI Brochure, 8th edition</em> ().<a href="#fnref26">↩</a></li>
