   UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate sulfotransferase      UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate sulfotransferase   In enzymology , an UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine 4-sulfate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine 4,6-bissulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine 4-sulfate , whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine 4,6-bissulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-4-sulfate 6-sulfotransferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoacetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate sulfotransferase , uridine diphospho-N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate sulfotransferase , and uridine diphosphoacetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate sulfotransferase .
