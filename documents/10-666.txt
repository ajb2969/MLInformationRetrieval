   3-dehydro-L-gulonate 2-dehydrogenase      3-dehydro-L-gulonate 2-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 3-dehydro-L-gulonate 2-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-dehydro-L-gulonate + NAD(P) +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (4R,5S)-4,5,6-trihydroxy-2,3-dioxohexanoate + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 3-dehydro-L-gulonate , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are (4R,5S)-4,5,6-trihydroxy-2,3-dioxohexanoate , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-dehydro-L-gulonate:NAD(P) + 2-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 3-keto-L-gulonate dehydrogenase , 3-ketogulonate dehydrogenase , 3-keto-L-gulonate dehydrogenase , and 3-ketogulonate dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism .
