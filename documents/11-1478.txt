DTMP kinase

In enzymology, a dTMP kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + dTMP 
 
 
 
  ADP + dTDP
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and dTMP, whereas its two products are ADP and dTDP.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a phosphate group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:dTMP phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include thymidine monophosphate kinase, thymidylate kinase, thymidylate monophosphate kinase, thymidylic acid kinase, thymidylic kinase, deoxythymidine 5'-monophosphate kinase, TMPK, and thymidine 5'-monophosphate kinase. This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism.
