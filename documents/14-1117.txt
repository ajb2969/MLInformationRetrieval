Fractional programming

In mathematical optimization, fractional programming is a generalization of linear-fractional programming. The objective function in a fractional program is a ratio of two functions that are in general nonlinear. The ratio to be optimized often describes some kind of efficiency of a system.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be real-valued functions defined on a set 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
 
 . The nonlinear program



where 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , is called a fractional program.
Concave fractional programs
A fractional program in which f is nonnegative and concave, g is positive and convex, and S is a convex set is called a concave fractional program. If g is affine, f does not have to be restricted in sign. The linear fractional program is a special case of a concave fractional program where all functions 
 
 
 
  are affine.
Properties
The function 
 
 
 
 
  is semistrictly quasiconcave on S. If f and g are differentiable, then q is pseudoconcave. In a linear fractional program, the objective function is pseudolinear.
Transformation to a concave program
By the transformation 
 
 
 
 , any concave fractional program can be transformed to the equivalent parameter-free concave program 1



If g is affine, the first constraint is changed to 
 
 
 
  and the assumption that f is nonnegative may be dropped.
Duality
The Lagrangean dual of the equivalent concave program is
