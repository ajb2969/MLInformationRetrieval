   Fractional programming      Fractional programming   In mathematical optimization , fractional programming is a generalization of linear-fractional programming . The objective function in a fractional program is a ratio of two functions that are in general nonlinear. The ratio to be optimized often describes some kind of efficiency of a system.  Definition  Let      f  ,  g  ,   h  j   ,  j   =  1   ,   …  ,  m      formulae-sequence     f  g   subscript  h  j   j   1    normal-…  m     f,g,h_{j},j=1,\ldots,m   be real-valued functions defined on a set     𝐒  0   ⊂   ℝ  n        subscript  𝐒  0    superscript  ℝ  n     \mathbf{S}_{0}\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}   . Let    𝐒  =   {   𝒙  ∈   𝐒  0    :      h  j    (  𝒙  )    ≤  0   ,   j  =   1  ,  …  ,  m     }       𝐒   conditional-set    𝒙   subscript  𝐒  0     formulae-sequence       subscript  h  j   𝒙   0     j   1  normal-…  m        \mathbf{S}=\{\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbf{S}_{0}:h_{j}(\boldsymbol{x})\leq 0,j=1,%
 \ldots,m\}   . The nonlinear program        maximize   𝒙  ∈  𝐒      f   (  𝒙  )     g   (  𝒙  )      ,        𝒙  𝐒   maximize       f  𝒙     g  𝒙      \underset{\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbf{S}}{\text{maximize}}\quad\frac{f(%
 \boldsymbol{x})}{g(\boldsymbol{x})},     where     g   (  𝒙  )    >  0        g  𝒙   0    g(\boldsymbol{x})>0   on   𝐒   𝐒   \mathbf{S}   , is called a fractional program.  Concave fractional programs  A fractional program in which f is nonnegative and concave, g is positive and convex, and S is a convex set is called a concave fractional program . If g is affine, f does not have to be restricted in sign. The linear fractional program is a special case of a concave fractional program where all functions      f  ,  g  ,   h  j   ,  j   =  1   ,   …  ,  m      formulae-sequence     f  g   subscript  h  j   j   1    normal-…  m     f,g,h_{j},j=1,\ldots,m   are affine.  Properties  The function     q   (  𝒙  )    =     f   (  𝒙  )    /  g    (  𝒙  )          q  𝒙         f  𝒙   g   𝒙     q(\boldsymbol{x})=f(\boldsymbol{x})/g(\boldsymbol{x})   is semistrictly quasiconcave on S . If f and g are differentiable, then q is pseudoconcave . In a linear fractional program, the objective function is pseudolinear .  Transformation to a concave program  By the transformation     𝒚  =   𝒙   g   (  𝒙  )      ;   t  =   1   g   (  𝒙  )         formulae-sequence    𝒚    𝒙    g  𝒙       t    1    g  𝒙       \boldsymbol{y}=\frac{\boldsymbol{x}}{g(\boldsymbol{x})};t=\frac{1}{g(%
 \boldsymbol{x})}   , any concave fractional program can be transformed to the equivalent parameter-free concave program  1      maximize     𝒚  t    ∈   𝐒  0           𝒚  t    subscript  𝐒  0    maximize    \displaystyle\underset{\frac{\boldsymbol{y}}{t}\in\mathbf{S}_{0}}{\text{%
 maximize}}     If g is affine, the first constraint is changed to     t  g   (   𝒚  t   )    =  1        t  g    𝒚  t    1    tg(\frac{\boldsymbol{y}}{t})=1   and the assumption that f is nonnegative may be dropped.  Duality  The Lagrangean dual of the equivalent concave program is      minimize  𝒖     𝒖  minimize    \displaystyle\underset{\boldsymbol{u}}{\text{minimize}}     Notes    References      "  Category:Mathematical optimization  Category:Operations research     ↩
