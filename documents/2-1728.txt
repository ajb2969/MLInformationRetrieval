   Lyman-alpha line      Lyman-alpha line   In physics , the Lyman-alpha line , sometimes written as Ly-   α   α   \alpha   line , is a spectral line of hydrogen , or more generally of one-electron ions , in the Lyman series , emitted when the electron falls from the    n  =  2      n  2    n=2   orbital to the    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   orbital, where n is the principal quantum number . In hydrogen, its wavelength of 1215.67 angstroms (121.567 nm or 1.21567 × 10 −7 m), corresponding to a frequency of 2.47 × 10 15 hertz, places the Lyman-alpha line in the vacuum ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Lyman-alpha astronomy must therefore ordinarily be carried out by satellite-borne instruments, except for extremely distant sources whose red-shifts allow the hydrogen line to penetrate the atmosphere.  Because of fine structure perturbations, the Lyman-alpha line splits into a doublet with wavelengths 1215.668 and 1215.674 angstroms. Specifically, because of the electron's spin-orbit interaction , the stationary eigenstates of the perturbed  Hamiltonian must be labeled by the total  angular momentum  j of the electron ( spin plus orbital ), not just the orbital angular momentum    l   l   l   . In the    n  =  2      n  2    n=2   orbital, there are two possible states,    j  =   1  /  2       j    1  2     j=1/2   and    j  =   3  /  2       j    3  2     j=3/2   , resulting in a spectral doublet. The    j  =   3  /  2       j    3  2     j=3/2   state is of higher energy (less negative) and so is energetically farther from the    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   orbital to which it is transitioning. Thus, the    j  =   3  /  2       j    3  2     j=3/2   state is associated with the more energetic (shorter wavelength) spectral line in the doublet. 1  A K-alpha line, or K α , analogous to the Lyman-alpha line for hydrogen, occurs in the high-energy induced emission spectra of all chemical elements, since it results from the same electron transition as in hydrogen. The equation for the frequency of this line (usually in the X-ray range for heavier elements) uses the same base-frequency as Lyman-alpha, but multiplied by a (Z−1) 2 factor to account for the differing atomic numbers (Z) of heavier elements, as approximated by Moseley's law . 2  The Lyman-alpha line is most simply described by the {n,m} = {1,2...} solutions to the empirical Rydberg formula for hydrogen's Lyman spectral series. (The Lyman-alpha frequency is produced by multiplying the Rydberg frequency for the atomic mass of hydrogen, R M (see Rydberg constant ), by a factor of 1/1 2 - 1/2 2 = 3/4.) Empirically, the Rydberg equation is in turn modeled by the semi-classical Bohr model of the atom.  See also  References  "  Category:Atomic physics  Category:Astronomical spectroscopy     Bruce T.
