   N-isopropylammelide isopropylaminohydrolase      N-isopropylammelide isopropylaminohydrolase   In enzymology , a N-isopropylammelide isopropylaminohydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-isopropylammelide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cyanuric acid + isopropylamine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-isopropylammelide and H 2 O , whereas its two products are cyanuric acid and isopropylamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in compounds that have not been otherwise categorized within EC number 3.5. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-isopropylammelide isopropylaminohydrolase . This enzyme is also called AtzC . This enzyme participates in atrazine degradation .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
