   Mills' constant      Mills' constant   In number theory , Mills' constant is defined as the smallest positive real number  A such that the floor of the double exponential function      ⌊   A   3  n    ⌋       superscript  A   superscript  3  n      \lfloor A^{3^{n}}\rfloor     is a prime number , for all positive integers n . This constant is named after William H. Mills who proved in 1947 the existence of A based on results of Guido Hoheisel and Albert Ingham on the prime gaps . Its value is unknown, but if the Riemann hypothesis is true, it is approximately 1.3063778838630806904686144926... .  Mills primes  The primes generated by Mills' constant are known as Mills primes; if the Riemann hypothesis is true, the sequence begins   2, 11, 1361, 2521008887, 16022236204009818131831320183, 4113101149215104800030529537915953170486139623539759933135949994882770404074832568499, ... .   If a i denotes the i th prime in this sequence, then a i can be calculated as the smallest prime number larger than    a   i  -  1   3     superscript   subscript  a    i  1    3    a_{i-1}^{3}   . In order to ensure that rounding    A   3  n      superscript  A   superscript  3  n     A^{3^{n}}   , for n = 1, 2, 3, …, produces this sequence of primes, it must be the case that     a  i   <    (    a   i  -  1    +  1   )   3        subscript  a  i    superscript     subscript  a    i  1    1   3     a_{i}<(a_{i-1}+1)^{3}   . The Hoheisel–Ingham results guarantee that there exists a prime between any two sufficiently large cubic numbers , which is sufficient to prove this inequality if we start from a sufficiently large first prime    a  1     subscript  a  1    a_{1}   . The Riemann hypothesis implies that there exists a prime between any two consecutive cubes, allowing the sufficiently large condition to be removed, and allowing the sequence of Mills primes to begin at a 1 = 2.  Currently, the largest known Mills prime (under the Riemann hypothesis) is         (     (     (     (     (     (     (     (     (    2  3   +  3   )   3   +  30   )   3   +  6   )   3   +  80   )   3   +  12   )   3   +  450   )   3   +  894   )   3   +  3636   )   3   +  70756   )   3   +  97220   ,       superscript     superscript     superscript     superscript     superscript     superscript     superscript     superscript     superscript     superscript  2  3   3   3   30   3   6   3   80   3   12   3   450   3   894   3   3636   3   70756   3   97220    \displaystyle(((((((((2^{3}+3)^{3}+30)^{3}+6)^{3}+80)^{3}+12)^{3}+450)^{3}+894%
 )^{3}+3636)^{3}+70756)^{3}+97220,   which is 20,562 digits long.  Numerical calculation  By calculating the sequence of Mills primes, one can approximate Mills' constant as       A  ≈   a    (  n  )    1  /   3  n       .      A    a   superscript  n    1   superscript  3  n        A\approx a(n)^{1/3^{n}}.   used this method to compute almost seven thousand base 10 digits of Mills' constant under the assumption that the Riemann hypothesis is true. There is no closed-form formula known for Mills' constant, and it is not even known whether this number is rational .  See also   Formula for primes   References    .   .   .
