   Teichmüller–Tukey lemma      Teichmüller–Tukey lemma   In mathematics, the Teichmüller–Tukey lemma (sometimes named just Tukey's lemma, ), named after John Tukey and Oswald Teichmüller , states that every nonempty collection of finite character has a maximal element with respect to inclusion. It is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice .  Definitions  A family of sets is of finite character provided it has the following properties:   For each    A  ∈  ℱ      A  ℱ    A\in\mathcal{F}   , every finite  subset of   A   A   A   belongs to   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   .  If every finite subset of a given set   A   A   A   belongs to   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   , then   A   A   A   belongs to   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   .   Applications  In linear algebra , the lemma may be used to show the existence of a basis . Let V be a vector space . Consider the collection   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   of linearly independent sets of vectors. This is a collection of finite character Thus, a maximal set exists, which must then span  V and be a basis for V .
