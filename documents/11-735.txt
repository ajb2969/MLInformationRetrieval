   Long-chain-fatty-acyl-glutamate deacylase      Long-chain-fatty-acyl-glutamate deacylase   In enzymology , a long-chain-fatty-acyl-glutamate deacylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-long-chain-fatty-acyl-L-glutamate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a long-chain carboxylate + L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-long-chain-fatty-acyl-L-glutamate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are long-chain carboxylate and L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-long-chain-fatty-acyl-L-glutamate amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include long-chain aminoacylase , long-chain-fatty-acyl-glutamate deacylase , long-chain acylglutamate amidase , and N-acyl-D-glutamate deacylase .
