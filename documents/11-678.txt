   Arginine deiminase      Arginine deiminase   In enzymology , an arginine deiminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-arginine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-citrulline + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-arginine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are L-citrulline and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-arginine iminohydrolase . Other names in common use include arginine dihydrolase , citrulline iminase , and L-arginine deiminase . This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism . This enzyme is widely expressed in bacteria, including streptococcus and actinomyces. The bacterial arginine deiminase expression could be regulated by various environmental factors.  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
