It can be obtained by reducing the 24-cell's cells to cubes or cuboctahedra.
It can also be considered a cantellated 16-cell with the lower symmetries B4 = [3,3,4]. B4 would lead to a bicoloring of the cuboctahedral cells into 8 and 16 each. It is also called a runcicantellated demitesseract in a D4 symmetry, giving 3 colors of cells, 8 for each.
Cartesian coordinates
A rectified 24-cell having an edge length of √2 has vertices given by all permutations and sign permutations of the following Cartesian coordinates:

(0,1,1,2) [4!/2!×23 = 96 vertices]
 

The dual configuration with edge length 2 has all coordinate and sign permutations of:

(0,2,2,2) [4×23 = 32 vertices]
 
(1,1,1,3) [4×24 = 64 vertices]

Symmetry constructions
There are three different symmetry constructions of this polytope. The lowest 
 
 
 
  construction can be doubled into 
 
 
 
  by adding a mirror that maps the bifurcating nodes onto each other. 
 
 
 
  can be mapped up to 
 
 
 
  symmetry by adding two mirror that map all three end nodes together.
The vertex figure is a triangular prism, containing two cubes and three cuboctahedra. The three symmetries can be seen with 3 colored cuboctahedra in the lowest 
 
 
 
  construction, and two colors (1:2 ratio) in 
 
 
 
 , and all identical cuboctahedra in 
 
 
 
 .
