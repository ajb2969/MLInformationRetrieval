Multivariate probit model

In statistics and econometrics, the multivariate probit model is a generalization of the probit model used to estimate several correlated binary outcomes jointly. For example, if it is believed that the decisions of sending at least one child to public school and that of voting in favor of a school budget are correlated (both decisions are binary), then the multivariate probit model would be appropriate for jointly predicting these two choices on an individual-specific basis.
Example: bivariate probit
In the ordinary probit model, there is only one binary dependent variable 
 
 
 
  and so only one latent variable

 
  is used. In contrast, in the bivariate probit model there are two binary dependent variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , so there are two latent variables
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . It is assumed that each observed variable takes on the value 1 if and only if its underlying continuous latent variable takes on a positive value:






with



and



Fitting the bivariate probit model involves estimating the values of 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . To do so, the likelihood of the model has to be maximized. This likelihood is



Substituting the latent variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in the probability functions and taking logs gives



After some rewriting, the log-likelihood function becomes:



Note that 
 
 
 
  is the cumulative distribution function of the bivariate normal distribution. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in the log-likelihood function are observed variables being equal to one or zero.
