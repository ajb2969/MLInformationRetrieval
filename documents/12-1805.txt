Collapse (topology)

In topology, a branch of mathematics, collapse is a concept due to J. H. C. Whitehead.1
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be an abstract simplicial complex.
Suppose that 
 
 
 
  such that the following two conditions are satisfied:
(i) 
 
 
 
 , in particular 
 
 
 
 ;
(ii) 
 
 
 
  is a maximal face of K and no other maximal face of K contains 
 
 
 
 ,
then 
 
 
 
  is called a free face.
A simplicial collapse of K is the removal of all simplices 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a free face. If additionally we have dim τ = dim σ-1, then this is called an elementary collapse.
A simplicial complex that has a sequence of collapses leading to a point is called collapsible. Every collapsible complex is contractible, but the converse is not true.
This definition can be extended to CW-complexes and is the basis for the concept of simple-homotopy equivalence.2
Examples

Complexes that do not have a free face cannot be collapsible. Two such interesting examples are Bing's house with two rooms and Zeeman's dunce hat; they are contractible (homotopy equivalent to a point), but not collapsible.
Any n-dimensional PL manifold that is collapsible is in fact piecewise-linearly isomorphic to an n-ball.3
