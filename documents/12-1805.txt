   Collapse (topology)      Collapse (topology)   In topology , a branch of mathematics, collapse is a concept due to J. H. C. Whitehead . 1  Definition  Let   K   K   K   be an abstract simplicial complex .  Suppose that     τ  ,  σ   ∈  K       τ  σ   K    \tau,\sigma\in K   such that the following two conditions are satisfied:  (i)    τ  ⊂  σ      τ  σ    \tau\subset\sigma   , in particular     dim  τ   <   dim  σ        dimension  τ    dimension  σ     \dim\tau<\dim\sigma   ;  (ii)   σ   σ   \sigma   is a maximal face of K and no other maximal face of K contains   τ   τ   \tau   ,  then   τ   τ   \tau   is called a free face .  A simplicial collapse of K is the removal of all simplices   γ   γ   \gamma   such that    τ  ⊆  γ  ⊆  σ        τ  γ       σ     \tau\subseteq\gamma\subseteq\sigma   , where   τ   τ   \tau   is a free face. If additionally we have dim τ = dim σ-1, then this is called an elementary collapse .  A simplicial complex that has a sequence of collapses leading to a point is called collapsible . Every collapsible complex is contractible, but the converse is not true.  This definition can be extended to CW-complexes and is the basis for the concept of simple-homotopy equivalence . 2  Examples   Complexes that do not have a free face cannot be collapsible. Two such interesting examples are Bing 's house with two rooms and Zeeman's dunce hat ; they are contractible (homotopy equivalent to a point), but not collapsible.  Any n -dimensional PL manifold that is collapsible is in fact piecewise-linearly isomorphic to an n -ball. 3   References  See also   Shelling (topology)   "  Category:Algebraic topology     Whitehead, J.H.C.
