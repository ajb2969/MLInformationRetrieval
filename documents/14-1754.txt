   Variable-mass system      Variable-mass system   (Figure)  Rockets , which lose significant amounts of mass as fuel during flight, are an example of a variable-mass system.   In mechanics , a variable-mass system is a collection of matter whose mass varies with time . It can be confusing to try to apply Newton's second law of motion directly to such a system. 1 2 Instead, the time dependence of the mass m can be calculated by rearranging Newton's second law and adding a term to account for the momentum carried by mass entering or leaving the system. The general equation of variable-mass motion is written as        𝐅  ext   +    𝐯  rel     d  m    d  t      =   m    d  𝐯    d  t            subscript  𝐅  ext      subscript  𝐯  rel       normal-d  m     normal-d  t        m      normal-d  𝐯     normal-d  t       \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{ext}}+\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{rel}}\frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{%
 d}t}=m{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}\over\mathrm{d}t}     where F ext is the net external force on the body, v rel is the relative velocity of the escaping or incoming mass with respect to the center of mass of the body, and v is the velocity of the body. 3 In astrodynamics , which deals with the mechanics of rockets , the term v rel is often called the effective exhaust velocity and denoted v e . 4  Derivation  There are different derivations for the variable-mass system motion equation, depending on whether the mass is entering or leaving a body (in other words, whether the moving body's mass is increasing or decreasing, respectively). To simplify calculations, all bodies are considered as particles . It is also assumed that the mass is unable to apply external forces on the body outside of accretion/ablation events.  Mass accretion  The following derivation is for a body that is gaining mass ( accretion ). Let a body of time-varying mass m moves at a velocity v at an initial time t . Meanwhile, at this instant, let a particle of mass dm moves with velocity u . The initial momentum can be written as 5       𝐩  1   =    m  𝐯   +   𝐮  d  m         subscript  𝐩  1       m  𝐯     𝐮  normal-d  m      \mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{1}}=m\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}\mathrm{d}m     Now at a time t + d t , let both the main body and the particle accrete into a body of velocity v + d v . Thus the new momentum of the system can be written as       𝐩  2   =    (   m  +   d  m    )    (   𝐯  +   d  𝐯    )    =    m  𝐯   +   m  d  𝐯   +   𝐯  d  m   +   d  m  d  𝐯           subscript  𝐩  2       m    normal-d  m      𝐯    normal-d  𝐯              m  𝐯     m  normal-d  𝐯     𝐯  normal-d  m     normal-d  m  normal-d  𝐯       \mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{2}}=(m+\mathrm{d}m)(\mathbf{v}+\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v})=m%
 \mathbf{v}+m\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{v}\mathrm{d}m+\mathrm{d}m\mathrm{d}%
 \mathbf{v}     Since d m d v is the product of two small values, it can be ignored, meaning during d t the momentum of the system varies for       d  𝐩   =    𝐩  2   -   𝐩  1    =    (    m  𝐯   +   m  d  𝐯   +   𝐯  d  m    )   -   (    m  𝐯   +   𝐮  d  m    )    =    m  d  𝐯   -    (   𝐮  -  𝐯   )   d  m            normal-d  𝐩      subscript  𝐩  2    subscript  𝐩  1               m  𝐯     m  normal-d  𝐯     𝐯  normal-d  m        m  𝐯     𝐮  normal-d  m              m  normal-d  𝐯       𝐮  𝐯   normal-d  m       \mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}=\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{2}}-\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{1}}=(m\mathbf%
 {v}+m\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{v}\mathrm{d}m)-(m\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}%
 \mathrm{d}m)=m\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}-(\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{v})\mathrm{d}m     Therefore, by Newton's second law       𝐅  net   =    d  𝐩    d  t    =     m  d  𝐯   -    (   𝐮  -  𝐯   )   d  m     d  t    =    m    d  𝐯    d  t     -    (   𝐮  -  𝐯   )     d  m    d  t             subscript  𝐅  net       normal-d  𝐩     normal-d  t               m  normal-d  𝐯       𝐮  𝐯   normal-d  m      normal-d  t             m      normal-d  𝐯     normal-d  t         𝐮  𝐯       normal-d  m     normal-d  t         \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{net}}=\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{m%
 \mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}-(\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{v})\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t}=m\frac{%
 \mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}-(\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{v})\frac{\mathrm{d}m}{%
 \mathrm{d}t}     Noting that u - v is the velocity of d m  relative to m , symbolized as v rel , this final equation can be arranged as 6        𝐅  ext   +    𝐯  rel     d  m    d  t      =   m    d  𝐯    d  t            subscript  𝐅  ext      subscript  𝐯  rel       normal-d  m     normal-d  t        m      normal-d  𝐯     normal-d  t       \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{ext}}+\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{rel}}\frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{%
 d}t}=m{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}\over\mathrm{d}t}     Mass ablation/ejection  In a system where mass is being ejected or ablated from a main body, the derivation is slightly different. At time t , let a mass m travel at a velocity v , meaning the initial momentum of the system is       𝐩  1   =   m  𝐯        subscript  𝐩  1     m  𝐯     \mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{1}}=m\mathbf{v}     Since the main body will be losing mass, d m will be negative, meaning that at a time t + d t the momentum of the system becomes       𝐩  2   =     (   m  +   d  m    )    (   𝐯  +   d  𝐯    )    +   𝐮   (   -   d  m    )     =     m  𝐯   +   m  d  𝐯   +   𝐯  d  m   +   d  m  d  𝐯    -   𝐮  d  m           subscript  𝐩  2         m    normal-d  m      𝐯    normal-d  𝐯       𝐮      normal-d  m                 m  𝐯     m  normal-d  𝐯     𝐯  normal-d  m     normal-d  m  normal-d  𝐯      𝐮  normal-d  m       \mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{2}}=(m+\mathrm{d}m)(\mathbf{v}+\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v})+%
 \mathbf{u}(-\mathrm{d}m)=m\mathbf{v}+m\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{v}\mathrm{d%
 }m+\mathrm{d}m\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u}\mathrm{d}m     where u is the velocity of the ejected mass. Thus during d t the momentum of the system varies for       d  𝐩   =    𝐩  2   -   𝐩  1    =    (     m  𝐯   +   m  d  𝐯   +   𝐯  d  m    -   𝐮  d  m    )   -   (   m  𝐯   )    =    m  d  𝐯   -    (   𝐮  -  𝐯   )   d  m            normal-d  𝐩      subscript  𝐩  2    subscript  𝐩  1                 m  𝐯     m  normal-d  𝐯     𝐯  normal-d  m      𝐮  normal-d  m      m  𝐯             m  normal-d  𝐯       𝐮  𝐯   normal-d  m       \mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}=\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{2}}-\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{1}}=(m\mathbf%
 {v}+m\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{v}\mathrm{d}m-\mathbf{u}\mathrm{d}m)-(m%
 \mathbf{v})=m\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}-(\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{v})\mathrm{d}m     This is the same d p as found in the mass accretion case above, meaning that the same conclusion holds. 7  Forms  By the definition of acceleration , a = d v /d t , so the variable-mass system motion equation can be written as        𝐅  ext   +    𝐯  rel     d  m    d  t      =   m  𝐚          subscript  𝐅  ext      subscript  𝐯  rel       normal-d  m     normal-d  t        m  𝐚     \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{ext}}+\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{rel}}\frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{%
 d}t}=m\mathbf{a}     In bodies that are not treated as particles a must be replaced by a cm , the acceleration of the center of mass of the system, meaning        𝐅  ext   +    𝐯  rel     d  m    d  t      =   m   𝐚  cm           subscript  𝐅  ext      subscript  𝐯  rel       normal-d  m     normal-d  t        m   subscript  𝐚  cm      \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{ext}}+\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{rel}}\frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{%
 d}t}=m\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{cm}}     Often the force due to thrust is defined as     𝐅  thrust   =    𝐯  rel     d  m    d  t          subscript  𝐅  thrust      subscript  𝐯  rel       normal-d  m     normal-d  t       \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{thrust}}=\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{rel}}\frac{\mathrm{d}m}{%
 \mathrm{d}t}   so that        𝐅  ext   +   𝐅  thrust    =   m   𝐚  cm           subscript  𝐅  ext    subscript  𝐅  thrust      m   subscript  𝐚  cm      \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{ext}}+\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{thrust}}=m\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{cm}}     This form shows that a body can have acceleration due to thrust even if no external forces act on it ( F ext = 0). Note finally that if one lets F net be the sum of F ext and F thrust then the equation regains the usual form of Newton's second law:       𝐅  net   =   m   𝐚  cm         subscript  𝐅  net     m   subscript  𝐚  cm      \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{net}}=m\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{cm}}     Ideal rocket equation  The ideal rocket equation , or the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, can be used to study the motion of vehicles that behave like a rocket (where a body accelerates itself by ejecting part of its mass, a propellant , with high speed). It can be derived from the general equation of motion for variable-mass systems as follows: when no external forces act on a body ( F ext = 0) the variable-mass system motion equation reduces to 8        𝐯  rel     d  m    d  t     =   m    d  𝐯    d  t            subscript  𝐯  rel       normal-d  m     normal-d  t       m      normal-d  𝐯     normal-d  t       \mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{rel}}\frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t}=m\frac{\mathrm{d}%
 \mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}     If the velocity of the ejected propellant, v rel , is assumed have the opposite direction as the rocket's acceleration, d v /d t , the scalar equivalent of this equation can be written as       -    v  rel     d  m    d  t      =   m    d  v    d  t              subscript  v  rel       normal-d  m     normal-d  t        m      normal-d  v     normal-d  t       -v_{\mathrm{rel}}\frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t}=m{\mathrm{d}v\over\mathrm{d}t}     from which d t can be canceled out to give       -    v  rel   d  m    =   m  d   v             subscript  v  rel   normal-d  m      m  normal-d  v     -v_{\mathrm{rel}}\mathrm{d}m=m\mathrm{d}v\,     Integration by separation of variables gives       -    v  rel     ∫   m  0    m  1      d  m   m      =    ∫   v  0    v  1     d  v             subscript  v  rel     superscript   subscript    subscript  m  0     subscript  m  1        normal-d  m   m        superscript   subscript    subscript  v  0     subscript  v  1      normal-d  v      -v_{\mathrm{rel}}\int_{m_{0}}^{m_{1}}\frac{\mathrm{d}m}{m}=\int_{v_{0}}^{v_{1}%
