   Inorganic diphosphatase      Inorganic diphosphatase   In enzymology , an inorganic diphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   diphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are diphosphate and H 2 O , whereas its product is phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is diphosphate phosphohydrolase . This enzyme participates in oxidative phosphorylation . It employs one cofactor , metal .
