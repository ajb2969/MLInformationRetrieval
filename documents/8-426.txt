   Schmidt decomposition      Schmidt decomposition   In linear algebra , the Schmidt decomposition (named after its originator Erhard Schmidt ) refers to a particular way of expressing a vector in the tensor product of two inner product spaces . It has numerous applications in quantum information theory , for example in entanglement characterization and in state purification , and plasticity .  Theorem  Let    H  1     subscript  H  1    H_{1}   and    H  2     subscript  H  2    H_{2}   be Hilbert spaces of dimensions  n and m respectively. Assume    n  ≥  m      n  m    n\geq m   . For any vector   v   v   v   in the tensor product     H  1   ⊗   H  2      tensor-product   subscript  H  1    subscript  H  2     H_{1}\otimes H_{2}   , there exist orthonormal sets     {   u  1   ,  …  ,   u  m   }   ⊂   H  1         subscript  u  1   normal-…   subscript  u  m     subscript  H  1     \{u_{1},\ldots,u_{m}\}\subset H_{1}   and     {   v  1   ,  …  ,   v  m   }   ⊂   H  2         subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  m     subscript  H  2     \{v_{1},\ldots,v_{m}\}\subset H_{2}   such that    v  =    ∑   i  =  1   m      α  i    u  i    ⊗   v  i         v    superscript   subscript     i  1    m    tensor-product     subscript  α  i    subscript  u  i     subscript  v  i       v=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\alpha_{i}u_{i}\otimes v_{i}   , where the scalars    α  i     subscript  α  i    \alpha_{i}   are real, non-negative, and, as a set, uniquely determined by   v   v   v   .  Proof  The Schmidt decomposition is essentially a restatement of the singular value decomposition in a different context. Fix orthonormal bases     {   e  1   ,  …  ,   e  n   }   ⊂   H  1         subscript  e  1   normal-…   subscript  e  n     subscript  H  1     \{e_{1},\ldots,e_{n}\}\subset H_{1}   and     {   f  1   ,  …  ,   f  m   }   ⊂   H  2         subscript  f  1   normal-…   subscript  f  m     subscript  H  2     \{f_{1},\ldots,f_{m}\}\subset H_{2}   . We can identify an elementary tensor     e  i   ⊗   f  j      tensor-product   subscript  e  i    subscript  f  j     e_{i}\otimes f_{j}   with the matrix     e  i    f  j  T        subscript  e  i    superscript   subscript  f  j   T     e_{i}f_{j}^{T}   , where    f  j  T     superscript   subscript  f  j   T    f_{j}^{T}   is the transpose of    f  j     subscript  f  j    f_{j}   . A general element of the tensor product      v  =    ∑    1  ≤  i  ≤  n   ,   1  ≤  j  ≤  m        β   i  j     e  i    ⊗   f  j         v    subscript    formulae-sequence      1  i       n        1  j       m       tensor-product     subscript  β    i  j     subscript  e  i     subscript  f  j       v=\sum_{1\leq i\leq n,1\leq j\leq m}\beta_{ij}e_{i}\otimes f_{j}     can then be viewed as the n × m matrix         M   v   =    (   β   i  j    )    i  j     .       subscript  M  v    subscript   subscript  β    i  j      i  j      \;M_{v}=(\beta_{ij})_{ij}.     By the singular value decomposition, there exist an n × n unitary U , m × m unitary V , and a positive semidefinite diagonal m × m matrix Σ such that        M  v   =   U   [     Σ      0     ]    V  ⋆     .       subscript  M  v     U    normal-Σ    0     superscript  V  normal-⋆      M_{v}=U\begin{bmatrix}\Sigma\\
 0\end{bmatrix}V^{\star}.     Write    U  =   [      U  1      U  2      ]       U     subscript  U  1    subscript  U  2       U=\begin{bmatrix}U_{1}&U_{2}\end{bmatrix}   where    U  1     subscript  U  1    U_{1}   is n × m and we have         M   v   =    U  1   Σ   V  ⋆     .       subscript  M  v      subscript  U  1   normal-Σ   superscript  V  normal-⋆      \;M_{v}=U_{1}\Sigma V^{\star}.     Let    {   u  1   ,  …  ,   u  m   }      subscript  u  1   normal-…   subscript  u  m     \{u_{1},\ldots,u_{m}\}   be the first m column vectors of    U  1     subscript  U  1    U_{1}   ,    {   v  1   ,  …  ,   v  m   }      subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  m     \{v_{1},\ldots,v_{m}\}   the column vectors of V , and     α  1   ,  …  ,   α  m       subscript  α  1   normal-…   subscript  α  m     \alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{m}   the diagonal elements of Σ. The previous expression is then        M  v   =    ∑   k  =  1   m     α  k    u  k    v  k  ⋆      ,       subscript  M  v     superscript   subscript     k  1    m      subscript  α  k    subscript  u  k    superscript   subscript  v  k   normal-⋆       M_{v}=\sum_{k=1}^{m}\alpha_{k}u_{k}v_{k}^{\star},     Then       v  =    ∑   k  =  1   m      α  k    u  k    ⊗   v  k      ,      v    superscript   subscript     k  1    m    tensor-product     subscript  α  k    subscript  u  k     subscript  v  k       v=\sum_{k=1}^{m}\alpha_{k}u_{k}\otimes v_{k},     which proves the claim.  Some observations  Some properties of the Schmidt decomposition are of physical interest.  Spectrum of reduced states  Consider a vector w of the tensor product       H  1   ⊗   H  2      tensor-product   subscript  H  1    subscript  H  2     H_{1}\otimes H_{2}     in the form of Schmidt decomposition       w  =    ∑   i  =  1   m      α  i    u  i    ⊗   v  i      .      w    superscript   subscript     i  1    m    tensor-product     subscript  α  i    subscript  u  i     subscript  v  i       w=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\alpha_{i}u_{i}\otimes v_{i}.     Form the rank 1 matrix ρ = w w* . Then the partial trace of ρ , with respect to either system A or B , is a diagonal matrix whose non-zero diagonal elements are | α i | 2 . In other words, the Schmidt decomposition shows that the reduced state of ρ on either subsystem have the same spectrum.  Schmidt rank and entanglement  The strictly positive values     α  i     subscript  α  i    \alpha_{i}    in the Schmidt decomposition of w are its Schmidt coefficients . The number of Schmidt coefficients of   w   w   w   , counted with multiplicity, is called its Schmidt rank , or Schmidt number .  If w can be expressed as a product      u  ⊗  v     tensor-product  u  v    u\otimes v   then w is called a separable state . Otherwise, w is said to be an entangled state . From the Schmidt decomposition, we can see that w is entangled if and only if w has Schmidt rank strictly greater than 1. Therefore, two subsystems that partition a pure state are entangled if and only if their reduced states are mixed states.  Von Neumann entropy  A consequence of the above comments is that, for bipartite pure states, the von Neumann entropy of the reduced states is a well-defined measure of entanglement . For the von Neumann entropy of both reduced states of ρ is    -    ∑  i      |   α  i   |   2    log    |   α  i   |   2            subscript   i      superscript     subscript  α  i    2      superscript     subscript  α  i    2        -\sum_{i}|\alpha_{i}|^{2}\log|\alpha_{i}|^{2}   , and this is zero if and only if only if ρ is a product state (not entangled).  Crystal plasticity  In the field of plasticity, crystalline solids such as metals deform plastically primarily along crystal planes. Each plane, defined by its normal vector ν can "slip" in one of several directions, defined by a vector μ. Together a slip plane and direction form a slip system which is described by the Schmidt tensor    P  =   μ  ⊗  ν       P   tensor-product  μ  ν     P=\mu\otimes\nu   . The velocity gradient is a linear combination of these across all slip systems where the scaling factor is the rate of slip along the system.
