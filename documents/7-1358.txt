   Net acid excretion      Net acid excretion   In renal physiology , net acid excretion ( NAE ) is the net amount of acid excreted in the urine per unit time. Its value depends on urine flow rate, urine acid concentration, and the concentration of bicarbonate in the urine (the loss of bicarbonate, a buffering agent , is physiologically equivalent to a gain in acid). NAE is commonly expressed in units of milliliters per minute (ml/min) and is given by the following equation:       N  A  E   =   V   (     U   N   H  4     +   U   T  A     -   U   H  C   O  3      )          N  A  E     V       subscript  U    N   subscript  H  4      subscript  U    T  A      subscript  U    H  C   subscript  O  3         NAE=V(U_{NH_{4}}+U_{TA}-U_{HCO_{3}})     where      Variable   Meaning     NAE   net acid excretion     V   volume of urine produced per unit time     U NH4   urine concentration of ammonium     U TA   urine concentration of titratable acid (e.g., phosphoric acid , sulfuric acid )     U HCO3   urine concentration of bicarbonate     Pathology  Increased net acid excretion is a compensation for respiratory acidosis , while decreased net acid excretion is a compenstation for respiratory alkalosis . 1  References  "  Category:Renal physiology     http://sprojects.mmi.mcgill.ca/nephrology/presentation/presentation4.htm â†©
