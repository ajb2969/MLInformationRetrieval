Net acid excretion




Net acid excretion

In renal physiology, net acid excretion (NAE) is the net amount of acid excreted in the urine per unit time. Its value depends on urine flow rate, urine acid concentration, and the concentration of bicarbonate in the urine (the loss of bicarbonate, a buffering agent, is physiologically equivalent to a gain in acid). NAE is commonly expressed in units of milliliters per minute (ml/min) and is given by the following equation:

Variable

Meaning



NAE

net acid excretion



V

volume of urine produced per unit time



UNH4

urine concentration of ammonium



UTA

urine concentration of titratable acid (e.g., phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid)



UHCO3

urine concentration of bicarbonate



Pathology
Increased net acid excretion is a compensation for respiratory acidosis, while decreased net acid excretion is a compenstation for respiratory alkalosis.1
