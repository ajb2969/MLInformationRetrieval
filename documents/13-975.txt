Maximum coverage problem

The maximum coverage problem is a classical question in computer science, computational complexity theory, and operations research. It is a problem that is widely taught in approximation algorithms.
As input you are given several sets and a number 
 
 
 
 . The sets may have some elements in common. You must select at most 
 
 
 
  of these sets such that the maximum number of elements are covered, i.e. the union of the selected sets has maximal size.
Formally, (unweighted) Maximum Coverage

Instance: A number 
 
 
 
  and a collection of sets 
 
 
 
 
 .
 
Objective: Find a subset 
 
 
 
  of sets, such that 
 
 
 
  and the number of covered elements 
 
 
 
  is maximized.
 

The maximum coverage problem is NP-hard, and cannot be approximated within 
 
 
 
  under standard assumptions. This result essentially matches the approximation ratio achieved by the generic greedy algorithm used for maximization of submodular functions with a cardinality constraint.1
ILP formulation
The maximum coverage problem can be formulated as the following integer linear program.




maximize





(maximizing the sum of covered elements)



subject to





(no more than 
 
 
 
  sets are selected)








(if 
 
 
 
  then at least one set 
 
 
 
 
  is selected)








(if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is covered)








(if 
 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is selected for the cover)



Greedy algorithm
The greedy algorithm for maximum coverage chooses sets according to one rule: at each stage, choose a set which contains the largest number of uncovered elements. It can be shown that this algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of 
 
 
 
 .2 Inapproximability results show that the greedy algorithm is essentially the best-possible polynomial time approximation algorithm for maximum coverage.3
Known extensions
The inapproximability results apply to all extensions of the maximum coverage problem since they hold the maximum coverage problem as a special case.
Weighted version
In the weighted version every element 
 
 
 
  has a weight 
 
 
 
 . The task is to find a maximum coverage which has maximum weight. The basic version is a special case when all weights are 
 
 
 
 
 .

The greedy algorithm for the weighted maximum coverage at each stage chooses a set which contains the maximum weight of uncovered elements. This algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of

Budgeted maximum coverage
In the budgeted maximum coverage version, not only does every element 
 
 
 
  have a weight 
 
 
 
 
 , but also every set 
 
 
 
  has a cost 
 
 
 
 . Instead of 
 
 
 
  that limits the number of sets in the cover a budget 
 
 
 
  is given. This budget 
 
 
 
 
  limits the weight of the cover that can be chosen.

A greedy algorithm will no longer produce solutions with a performance guarantee. Namely, the worst case behavior of this algorithm might be very far from the optimal solution. The approximation algorithm is extended by the following way. First, after finding a solution using the greedy algorithm, return the better of the greedy algorithm's solution and the set of largest weight. Call this algorithm the modified greedy algorithm. Second, starting with all possible families of sets of sizes from one to (at least) three, augment these solutions with the modified greedy algorithm. Third, return the best out of all augmented solutions. This algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of 
 
 
 
 . This is the best possible approximation ratio unless

Generalized maximum coverage
In the generalized maximum coverage version every set 
 
 
 
 
  has a cost 
 
 
 
 , element 
 
 
 
  has a different weight and cost depending on which set covers it. Namely, if 
 
 
 
  is covered by set 
 
 
 
  the weight of 
 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  and its cost is 
 
 
 
 . A budget 
 
 
 
  is given for the total cost of the solution.

Generalized maximum coverage algorithm
The algorithm uses the concept of residual cost/weight. The residual cost/weight is measured against a tentative solution and it is the difference of the cost/weight from the cost/weight gained by a tentative solution.
The algorithm has several stages. First, find a solution using greedy algorithm. In each iteration of the greedy algorithm the tentative solution is added the set which contains the maximum residual weight of elements divided by the residual cost of these elements along with the residual cost of the set. Second, compare the solution gained by the first step to the best solution which uses a small number of sets. Third, return the best out of all examined solutions. This algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of
