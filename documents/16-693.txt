   Infinite loop space machine      Infinite loop space machine   In topology, a branch of mathematics, given a topological monoid X up to homotopy (in a nice way), an infinite loop space machine produces a group completion of X together with infinite loop space structure. For example, one can take X to be the classifying space of a symmetric monoidal category  S ; that is,    X  =   B  S       X    B  S     X=BS   . Then the machine produces the group completion     B  S   →   K   (  S  )       normal-→    B  S     K  S     BS\to K(S)   . The space    K   (  S  )       K  S    K(S)   may be described by the K-theory spectrum of S .
