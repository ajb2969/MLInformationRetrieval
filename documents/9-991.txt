   Anomalous cancellation      Anomalous cancellation   An anomalous cancellation or accidental cancellation is a particular kind of arithmetic procedural error that gives a numerically correct answer. An attempt is made to reduce a fraction by canceling individual digits in the numerator and denominator . This is not a legitimate operation, and does not in general give a correct answer, but in some rare cases the result is numerically the same as if a correct procedure had been applied. 1  Examples of anomalous cancellations which still produce the correct result include (these and their inverses are all the cases in base 10 with the fraction different from 1 and with two digits):       64  16   =    64    1  6̸    =   4  1   =  4          64  16       64     1  6̸           4  1        4     \frac{64}{16}=\frac{\not 64}{1\not 6}=\frac{4}{1}=4          26  65   =    2  6̸    65    =   2  5           26  65       2  6̸     65           2  5      \frac{26}{65}=\frac{2\not 6}{\not 65}=\frac{2}{5}          19  95   =    1  9̸    95    =   1  5           19  95       1  9̸     95           1  5      \frac{19}{95}=\frac{1\not 9}{\not 95}=\frac{1}{5}          98  49   =    98    4  9̸    =   8  4   =  2.          98  49       98     4  9̸           8  4        2.     \frac{98}{49}=\frac{\not 98}{4\not 9}=\frac{8}{4}=2.    2  The article by Boas analyzes two-digit cases in bases other than base 10 , e.g., 32/13 = 2/1 and its inverse are the only solutions in base 4 with two digits. 3  The anomalous cancellation happens also with more digits, e.g. 165/462 = 15/42.
