Mannosylfructose-phosphate phosphatase

Mannosylfructose-phosphate phosphatase (, mannosylfructose-6-phosphate phosphatase, MFPP) is an enzyme with system name beta-D-fructofuranosyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside-6F-phosphate phosphohydrolase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

beta-D-fructofuranosyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside 6F-phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  beta-D-fructofuranosyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside + phosphate


This enzyme, from the soil proteobacterium and plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58, requires Mg2+ for activity.
