   Lebesgue's number lemma      Lebesgue's number lemma   In topology , Lebesgue's number lemma , named after Henri Lebesgue , is a useful tool in the study of compact  metric spaces . It states:   If the metric space    (  X  ,  d  )     X  d    (X,d)   is compact and an open cover of   X   X   X   is given, then there exists a number    δ  >  0      δ  0    \delta>0   such that every subset of   X   X   X   having diameter less than   δ   δ   \delta   ; is contained in some member of the cover.   Such a number   δ   δ   \delta   is called a Lebesgue number of this cover. The notion of a Lebesgue number itself is useful in other applications as well.  Proof  Let   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   be an open cover of   X   X   X   . Since   X   X   X   is compact we can extract a finite subcover     {   A  1   ,  …  ,   A  n   }   ⊆  𝒰        subscript  A  1   normal-…   subscript  A  n    𝒰    \{A_{1},\dots,A_{n}\}\subseteq\mathcal{U}   .  For each    i  ∈   {  1  ,  …  ,  n  }       i   1  normal-…  n     i\in\{1,\dots,n\}   , let     C  i   :=   X  ∖   A  i       assign   subscript  C  i     X   subscript  A  i      C_{i}:=X\setminus A_{i}   and define a function    f  :   X  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  ℝ     f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   by     f   (  x  )    :=    1  n     ∑   i  =  1   n    d   (  x  ,   C  i   )         assign    f  x       1  n     superscript   subscript     i  1    n     d   x   subscript  C  i         f(x):=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}d(x,C_{i})   .  Since   f   f   f   is continuous on a compact set, it attains a minimum   δ   δ   \delta   . The key observation is that    δ  >  0      δ  0    \delta>0   . If   Y   Y   Y   is a subset of   X   X   X   of diameter less than   δ   δ   \delta   , then there exist     x  0   ∈  X       subscript  x  0   X    x_{0}\in X   such that    Y  ⊆    B  δ    (   x  0   )        Y     subscript  B  δ    subscript  x  0      Y\subseteq B_{\delta}(x_{0})   , where     B  δ    (   x  0   )        subscript  B  δ    subscript  x  0     B_{\delta}(x_{0})   denotes the radius   δ   δ   \delta   ball centered at    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   (namely, one can choose as    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   any point in   Y   Y   Y   ). Since     f   (   x  0   )    ≥  δ        f   subscript  x  0    δ    f(x_{0})\geq\delta   there must exist at least one   i   i   i   such that     d   (   x  0   ,   C  i   )    ≥  δ        d    subscript  x  0    subscript  C  i     δ    d(x_{0},C_{i})\geq\delta   . But this means that      B  δ    (   x  0   )    ⊆   A  i          subscript  B  δ    subscript  x  0     subscript  A  i     B_{\delta}(x_{0})\subseteq A_{i}   and so, in particular,    Y  ⊆   A  i       Y   subscript  A  i     Y\subseteq A_{i}   .
