Lebesgue's number lemma

In topology, Lebesgue's number lemma, named after Henri Lebesgue, is a useful tool in the study of compact metric spaces. It states:

If the metric space 
 
 
 
  is compact and an open cover of 
 
 
 
  is given, then there exists a number 
 
 
 
  such that every subset of 
 
 
 
  having diameter less than 
 
 
 
 ; is contained in some member of the cover.
 

Such a number 
 
 
 
  is called a Lebesgue number of this cover. The notion of a Lebesgue number itself is useful in other applications as well.
Proof
Let 
 
 
 
  be an open cover of 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  is compact we can extract a finite subcover 
 
 
 
 .
For each 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  and define a function 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 .
Since 
 
 
 
  is continuous on a compact set, it attains a minimum 
 
 
 
 . The key observation is that 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is a subset of 
 
 
 
  of diameter less than 
 
 
 
 , then there exist 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the radius 
 
 
 
  ball centered at 
 
 
 
  (namely, one can choose as 
 
 
 
  any point in 
 
 
 
 ). Since 
 
 
 
  there must exist at least one 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . But this means that 
 
 
 
  and so, in particular, 
 
 
 
 .
