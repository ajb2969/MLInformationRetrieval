   Glyoxylate dehydrogenase (acylating)      Glyoxylate dehydrogenase (acylating)   In enzymology , a glyoxylate dehydrogenase (acylating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   glyoxylate + CoA + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxalyl-CoA + NADPH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are glyoxylate , CoA , and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are oxalyl-CoA , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glyoxylate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (CoA-oxalylating) . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism .
