   Nuclear transparency      Nuclear transparency   Nuclear transparency is the ratio of cross-sections for exclusive processes from the nuclei to those of the nucleons .  If the nuclear cross-section is denoted as    σ  N     subscript  σ  N    \sigma_{N}   and free nucleon cross-section as    σ  0     subscript  σ  0    \sigma_{0}   then nuclear transparency can be defined as     T  =     σ  N   /  A    σ  0        T       subscript  σ  N   A    subscript  σ  0      T=\sigma_{N}/A\sigma_{0}   , where    σ  N     subscript  σ  N    \sigma_{N}   can be parameterized in terms of    σ  0     subscript  σ  0    \sigma_{0}   as     σ  N   =    A  α    σ  0         subscript  σ  N      superscript  A  α    subscript  σ  0      \sigma_{N}=A^{\alpha}\sigma_{0}   .  Therefore, transparency can be expressed as    T  =   A   α  -  1        T   superscript  A    α  1      T=A^{\alpha-1}   . Here nucleon cross-section can be thought of as hydrogen cross-section and nuclei cross-section can be as for other targets.  "  Category:Nuclear physics
