Nuclear transparency

Nuclear transparency is the ratio of cross-sections for exclusive processes from the nuclei to those of the nucleons.
If the nuclear cross-section is denoted as 
 
 
 
  and free nucleon cross-section as 
 
 
 
  then nuclear transparency can be defined as

 
 , where 
 
 
 
  can be parameterized in terms of 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 .
Therefore, transparency can be expressed as 
 
 
 
 .
 Here nucleon cross-section can be thought of as hydrogen cross-section and nuclei cross-section can be as for other targets.
