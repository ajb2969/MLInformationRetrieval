7-epi-alpha-selinene synthase

7-epi-alpha-selinene synthase () is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (7-epi-alpha-selinene-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  7-epi-alpha-selinene + diphosphate


The recombinant enzyme from Vitis vinifera forms (+)-valencene and (-)-7-epi-alpha-selinene.
