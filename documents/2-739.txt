   Snub cube      Snub cube   In geometry , the snub cube , or snub cuboctahedron , is an Archimedean solid with 38 faces: 6 squares and 32 equilateral triangles . It has 60 edges and 24 vertices .  It is a chiral polyhedron, that is, it has two distinct forms, which are mirror images (or " enantiomorphs ") of each other. The union of both forms is a compound of two snub cubes , and the convex hull of both sets of vertices is a truncated cuboctahedron .  Kepler first named it in Latin as cubus simus in 1619 in his Harmonices Mundi . H. S. M. Coxeter , noting it could be derived equally from the octahedron as the cube, called it snub cuboctahedron , with a vertical extended Schläfli symbol     s   {     4      3     }       s    4    3      s\begin{Bmatrix}4\\

Dimensions  For a snub cube with edge length 1, its surface area is    6  +   8   3        6    8    3      \scriptstyle{6+8\sqrt{3}}   and its volume is       613  t   +  203    9   (    35  t   -  62   )               613  t   203     9      35  t   62       \sqrt{\tfrac{613t+203}{9(35t-62)}}   , where t is the tribonacci constant       1  3    (   1  +    19  -   3   33     3   +    19  +   3   33     3    )    ≈  1.83929          1  3     1     3     19    3    33         3     19    3    33        1.83929    \tfrac{1}{3}\scriptstyle{\left(1+\sqrt[3]{19-3\sqrt{33}}+\sqrt[3]{19+3\sqrt{33%
 }}\right)\approx 1.83929}   .  If the original snub cube has edge length 1, its dual pentagonal icositetrahedron has side lengths     1    t  +  1     ≈  0.593465        1      t  1     0.593465    \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{t+1}}\scriptstyle{\approx 0.593465}   and      1  2     t  +  1     ≈  0.842509          1  2       t  1     0.842509    \tfrac{1}{2}\scriptstyle{\sqrt{t+1}\approx 0.842509}   .  Cartesian coordinates  Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a snub cube are all the even permutations of   (±1, ±1/t, ±t)   with an even number of plus signs, along with all the odd permutations with an odd number of plus signs, where t is the tribonacci constant . Taking the even permutations with an odd number of plus signs, and the odd permutations with an even number of plus signs, gives a different snub cube, the mirror image. Taking all of them together yields the compound of two snub cubes .  This snub cube has edges of length α, a number which satisfies the equation           α  6   -   4   α  4     +   16   α  2     -  32   =  0   ,             superscript  α  6     4   superscript  α  4       16   superscript  α  2     32   0    \alpha^{6}-4\alpha^{4}+16\alpha^{2}-32=0,\,     and can be written as      α  =      4  3   -   16   3  β     +    2  β   3     ≈  1.60972        α          4  3     16    3  β         2  β   3          1.60972     \alpha=\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}-\frac{16}{3\beta}+\frac{2\beta}{3}}\approx 1.60972         β  =    26  +   6   33     3       β     3     26    6    33        \beta=\sqrt[3]{26+6\sqrt{33}}     To get a snub cube with unit edge length, divide all the coordinates above by the value α given above.  Orthogonal projections  The snub cube has two special orthogonal projections , centered, on two types of faces: triangles, and squares, correspond to the A 2 and B 2  Coxeter planes .      Orthogonal projections     Centered by     Image     Projective symmetry     Dual image     Spherical tiling  The snub cube can also be represented as a spherical tiling , and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection . This projection is conformal , preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.

Cube    Rhombicuboctahedron ( Expanded cube )   Snub cube     It can also be constructed as an alternation of a nonuniform omnitruncated cube , deleting every other vertex and creating new triangles at the deleted vertices. A properly proportioned ( nonuniform ) great rhombicuboctahedron will create equilateral triangles at the deleted vertices. Depending on which set of vertices are alternated, the resulting snub cube can have a clockwise or counterclockwise twist.      A "improved" snub cube, with a slightly smaller square face and slightly larger triangular faces compared to Archimedes' uniform snub cube, is useful as a spherical design . 1  Related polyhedra and tilings  The snub cube is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.  This semiregular polyhedron is a member of a sequence of snubbed polyhedra and tilings with vertex figure (3.3.3.3. n ) and Coxeter–Dynkin diagram . These figures and their duals have (n32) rotational symmetry , being in the Euclidean plane for n=6, and hyperbolic plane for any higher n. The series can be considered to begin with n=2, with one set of faces degenerated into digons .  The snub cube is second in a series of snub polyhedra and tilings with vertex figure 3.3.4.3. n .  Snub cubical graph  In the mathematical field of graph theory , a snub cubical graph is the graph of vertices and edges of the snub cube , one of the Archimedean solids . It has 24 vertices and 60 edges, and is an Archimedean graph . 2      Orthogonal projection  (Figure)  Snub cube_A2.png      {{-}}  See also   Truncated cube  Compound of two snub cubes  Snub square tiling   References     (Section 3-9)    External links        The Uniform Polyhedra  Virtual Reality Polyhedra The Encyclopedia of Polyhedra  [ http://www.dr-mikes-math-games-for-kids.com/polyhedral-nets.html?net=KPFQTjUF59q9qFlmEqGmbfyT4Ykrpg7vn7pPKHBbttGwDk2Z6dABBNQuTy7b46U3TTtKxWPq6lgrdE2qYMNpS5ceb5Ie9K4gQt25UcMlwmW6OKK3HtK2QvnmOLGTZFLfHD7hM4GN1modJYJ5PjowXOUDwYnjnCRQFA0vsrVIwFkFiIy7Pi9foWycmqdJAnWMMpuCxwRrcdA49hnAjViEzr&name; ;=Snub+Cube#applet Editable printable net of a Snub Cube with interactive 3D view]   "  Category:Chiral polyhedra  Category:Uniform polyhedra  Category:Archimedean solids  Category:Snub tilings     "Spherical Designs" by R.H.
