   Legendre–Clebsch condition      Legendre–Clebsch condition   In the calculus of variations the Legendre–Clebsch condition is a second-order condition which a solution of the Euler–Lagrange equation must satisfy in order to be a maximum (and not a minimum or another kind of extremal).  For the problem of maximizing        ∫  a  b    L   (  t  ,  x  ,   x  ′   )   d  t    .      superscript   subscript   a   b     L   t  x   superscript  x  normal-′    d  t     \int_{a}^{b}L(t,x,x^{\prime})\,dt.\,     the condition is       0  ≥    L    x  ′    x  ′      (  t  ,   x   (  t  )    ,    x  ′    (  t  )    )     ,    ∀  t   ∈   [  a  ,  b  ]       formulae-sequence    0     subscript  L     superscript  x  normal-′    superscript  x  normal-′      t    x  t      superscript  x  normal-′   t         for-all  t    a  b      0\geq L_{x^{\prime}x^{\prime}}(t,x(t),x^{\prime}(t)),\,\forall t\in[a,b]     Generalized Legendre-Clebsch  In optimal control , the situation is more complicated because of the possibility of a singular solution . The generalized Legendre–Clebsch condition , 1 also known as convexity, 2 is a sufficient condition for local optimality such that when the linear sensitivity of the Hamiltonian to changes in u is zero, i.e.,        ∂  H    ∂  u    =  0          H     u    0    \frac{\partial H}{\partial u}=0     The Hessian of the Hamiltonian is positive definite along the trajectory of the solution:         ∂  2   H    ∂   u  2     >  0          superscript   2   H      superscript  u  2     0    \frac{\partial^{2}H}{\partial u^{2}}>0     In words, the generalized LC condition guarantees that over a singular arc, the Hamiltonian is minimized.
