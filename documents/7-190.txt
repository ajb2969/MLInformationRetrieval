   Two-point tensor      Two-point tensor   Two-point tensors , or double vectors , are tensor -like quantities which transform as vectors with respect to each of their indices and are used in continuum mechanics to transform between reference ("material") and present ("configuration") coordinates. 1 Examples include the deformation gradient and the first Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor .  As with many applications of tensors, Einstein summation notation is frequently used. To clarify this notation, capital indices are often used to indicate reference coordinates and lowercase for present coordinates. Thus, a two-point tensor will have one capital and one lower-case index; for example, A jM .  Continuum mechanics  A conventional tensor can be viewed as a transformation of vectors in one coordinate system to other vectors in the same coordinate system. In contrast, a two-point tensor transforms vectors from one coordinate system to another. That is, a conventional tensor,      𝐐  =    Q   p  q     (    𝐞  p   ⊗   𝐞  q    )        𝐐     subscript  Q    p  q     tensor-product   subscript  𝐞  p    subscript  𝐞  q       \mathbf{Q}=Q_{pq}(\mathbf{e}_{p}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{q})   , actively transforms a vector u to a vector v such that      𝐯  =  𝐐𝐮      𝐯  𝐐𝐮    \mathbf{v}=\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{u}   where v and u are measured in the same space and their coordinates representation is with respect to the same basis (denoted by the " e ").  In contrast, a two-point tensor, G will be written as      𝐆  =    G   p  q     (    𝐞  p   ⊗   𝐄  q    )        𝐆     subscript  G    p  q     tensor-product   subscript  𝐞  p    subscript  𝐄  q       \mathbf{G}=G_{pq}(\mathbf{e}_{p}\otimes\mathbf{E}_{q})   and will transform a vector, U , in E system to a vector, v , in the e system as      𝐯  =  𝐆𝐔      𝐯  𝐆𝐔    \mathbf{v}=\mathbf{GU}   .  The transformation law for two-point tensor  Suppose we have two coordinate systems one primed and another unprimed and a vectors' components transform between them as       v  p  ′   =    Q   p  q     v  q         subscript   superscript  v  normal-′   p      subscript  Q    p  q     subscript  v  q      v^{\prime}_{p}=Q_{pq}v_{q}   . For tensors suppose we then have       T   p  q     (    e  p   ⊗   e  q    )        subscript  T    p  q     tensor-product   subscript  e  p    subscript  e  q      T_{pq}(e_{p}\otimes e_{q})   . A tensor in the system    e  i     subscript  e  i    e_{i}   . In another system, let the same tensor be given by       T   p  q   ′    (    e  p  ′   ⊗   e  q  ′    )        subscript   superscript  T  normal-′     p  q     tensor-product   subscript   superscript  e  normal-′   p    subscript   superscript  e  normal-′   q      T^{\prime}_{pq}(e^{\prime}_{p}\otimes e^{\prime}_{q})   . We can say       T   i  j   ′   =    Q   i  p     Q   j  r     T   p  r          subscript   superscript  T  normal-′     i  j       subscript  Q    i  p     subscript  Q    j  r     subscript  T    p  r       T^{\prime}_{ij}=Q_{ip}Q_{jr}T_{pr}   . Then       T  ′   =   Q  T   Q  T         superscript  T  normal-′     Q  T   superscript  Q  T      T^{\prime}=QTQ^{T}   is the routine tensor transformation. But a two-point tensor between these systems is just       F   p  q     (    e  p  ′   ⊗   e  q    )        subscript  F    p  q     tensor-product   subscript   superscript  e  normal-′   p    subscript  e  q      F_{pq}(e^{\prime}_{p}\otimes e_{q})   which transforms as       F  ′   =   Q  F        superscript  F  normal-′     Q  F     F^{\prime}=QF   .  The most mundane example of a two-point tensor  The most mundane example of a two-point tensor is the transformation tensor, the Q in the above discussion. Note that       v  p  ′   =    Q   p  q     u  q         subscript   superscript  v  normal-′   p      subscript  Q    p  q     subscript  u  q      v^{\prime}_{p}=Q_{pq}u_{q}   . Now, writing out in full,      u  =    u  q    e  q        u     subscript  u  q    subscript  e  q      u=u_{q}e_{q}   and also      v  =    v  p  ′    e  p        v     subscript   superscript  v  normal-′   p    subscript  e  p      v=v^{\prime}_{p}e_{p}   . This then requires Q to be of the form       Q   p  q     (    e  p  ′   ⊗   e  q    )        subscript  Q    p  q     tensor-product   subscript   superscript  e  normal-′   p    subscript  e  q      Q_{pq}(e^{\prime}_{p}\otimes e_{q})   . By definition of tensor product ,       (   e  p  ′   ⊗   e  q   )    e  q   =   (   e  q   .   e  q   )    e  p  ′   =   e  p  ′    (  1  )      fragments   fragments  normal-(   subscript   superscript  e  normal-′   p   tensor-product   subscript  e  q   normal-)    subscript  e  q     fragments  normal-(   subscript  e  q   normal-.   subscript  e  q   normal-)    subscript   superscript  e  normal-′   p     subscript   superscript  e  normal-′   p   italic-   fragments  normal-(  1  normal-)     (e^{\prime}_{p}\otimes e_{q})e_{q}=(e_{q}.e_{q})e^{\prime}_{p}=e^{\prime}_{p}%
 \qquad(1)   So we can write        u  p    e  p    =    (    Q   p  q     (    e  p  ′   ⊗   e  q    )    )    (    v  q    e  q    )           subscript  u  p    subscript  e  p         subscript  Q    p  q     tensor-product   subscript   superscript  e  normal-′   p    subscript  e  q        subscript  v  q    subscript  e  q       u_{p}e_{p}=(Q_{pq}(e^{\prime}_{p}\otimes e_{q}))(v_{q}e_{q})   Thus        u  p    e  p    =    Q   p  q     v  q    (    e  p  ′   ⊗   e  q    )    e  q           subscript  u  p    subscript  e  p       subscript  Q    p  q     subscript  v  q    tensor-product   subscript   superscript  e  normal-′   p    subscript  e  q     subscript  e  q      u_{p}e_{p}=Q_{pq}v_{q}(e^{\prime}_{p}\otimes e_{q})e_{q}   Incorporating (1), we have        u  p    e  p    =    Q   p  q     v  q    e  p           subscript  u  p    subscript  e  p       subscript  Q    p  q     subscript  v  q    subscript  e  p      u_{p}e_{p}=Q_{pq}v_{q}e_{p}   .
