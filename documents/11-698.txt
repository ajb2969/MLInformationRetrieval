   Cyanoalanine nitrilase      Cyanoalanine nitrilase   In enzymology , a cyanoalanine nitrilase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-cyano-L-alanine + 2 H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-aspartate + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-cyano-L-alanine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are L-aspartate and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in nitriles. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-cyano-L-alanine aminohydrolase . This enzyme is also called beta-cyanoalanine nitrilase . This enzyme participates in cyanoamino acid metabolism .
