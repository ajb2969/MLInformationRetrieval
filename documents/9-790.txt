Invariant factor

The invariant factors of a module over a principal ideal domain (PID) occur in one form of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain.
If 
 
 
 
  is a PID and 
 
 
 
  a finitely generated

 
 -module, then



for some integer 
 
 
 
  and a (possibly empty) list of nonzero elements 
 
 
 
  for which 
 
 
 
 . The nonnegative integer 
 
 
 
  is called the free rank or Betti number of the module 
 
 
 
 , while 
 
 
 
  are the invariant factors of 
 
 
 
  and are unique up to associatedness.
The invariant factors of a matrix over a PID occur in the Smith normal form and provide a means of computing the structure of a module from a set of generators and relations.
