   Invariant factor      Invariant factor   The invariant factors of a module over a principal ideal domain (PID) occur in one form of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain .  If   R   R   R   is a PID and   M   M   M   a finitely generated    R   R   R   -module, then      M  ≅    R  r   ⊕   R  /   (   a  1   )    ⊕   R  /   (   a  2   )    ⊕  ⋯  ⊕   R  /   (   a  m   )         M   direct-sum   superscript  R  r     R   subscript  a  1      R   subscript  a  2    normal-⋯    R   subscript  a  m       M\cong R^{r}\oplus R/(a_{1})\oplus R/(a_{2})\oplus\cdots\oplus R/(a_{m})     for some integer    r  ≥  0      r  0    r\geq 0   and a (possibly empty) list of nonzero elements      a  1   ,  …  ,   a  m    ∈  R        subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  m    R    a_{1},\ldots,a_{m}\in R   for which     a  1   ∣   a  2   ∣  ⋯  ∣   a  m      fragments   subscript  a  1   normal-∣   subscript  a  2   normal-∣  normal-⋯  normal-∣   subscript  a  m     a_{1}\mid a_{2}\mid\cdots\mid a_{m}   . The nonnegative integer   r   r   r   is called the free rank or Betti number of the module   M   M   M   , while     a  1   ,  …  ,   a  m       subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  m     a_{1},\ldots,a_{m}   are the invariant factors of   M   M   M   and are unique up to associatedness .  The invariant factors of a matrix over a PID occur in the Smith normal form and provide a means of computing the structure of a module from a set of generators and relations.
