IMP dehydrogenase

IMP dehydrogenase  (Inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase) (Inosinic acid dehydrogenaseis) (IMPDH) an enzyme that converts inosine monophosphate to xanthosine monophosphate:1234

inosine 5'-phosphate + NAD+ + H2O

xanthosine 5'-phosphate + NADH + H+


It catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction of de novo GTP biosynthesis.5
IMP dehydrogenase is associated with cell proliferation and is a possible target for cancer chemotherapy. Mammalian and bacterial IMPDHs are tetramers of identical chains. There are two IMP dehydrogenase isozymes in humans.6 IMP dehydrogenase nearly always contains a long insertion that has two CBS domains within it.
The structure of this enzyme is composed of a TIM barrel domain with two CBS domains inserted within a loop.78
It is inhibited by Mycophenolic acid, ribavirin, and 6TGMP (6-thioguanine monophosphate). 6TGMP inhibition prevents purine interconversion and thus the synthesis of purine nucleotides.
Examples
Humans express the following two IMP dehydrogenase isozymes:
