3-dehydro-L-gulonate-6-phosphate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a 3-dehydro-L-gulonate-6-phosphate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-dehydro-L-gulonate 6-phosphate + H+

 
  L-xylulose 5-phosphate + CO2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-dehydro-L-gulonate 6-phosphate and H+, whereas its two products are L-xylulose 5-phosphate and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-dehydro-L-gulonate-6-phosphate carboxy-lyase (L-xylulose-5-phosphate-forming). Other names in common use include 3-keto-L-gulonate 6-phosphate decarboxylase, UlaD, SgaH, SgbH, KGPDC, and 3-dehydro-L-gulonate-6-phosphate carboxy-lyase. This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism.
