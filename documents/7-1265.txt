Ovoid (projective geometry)

In the projective space PG(3,q), with q a prime power greater than 2, an ovoid is a set of 
 
 
 
  points, no three of which are collinear (the maximum size of such a set).1 When 
 
 
 
  the largest set of non-collinear points has size eight and is the complement of a plane.2
An important example of an ovoid in any finite projective three-dimensional space are the 
 
 
 
  points of an elliptic quadric (all of which are projectively equivalent).
When q is odd or 
 
 
 
 , no ovoids exist other than the elliptic quadrics.3
When 
 
 
 
  another type of ovoid can be constructed : the Tits ovoid, also known as the Suzuki ovoid. It is conjectured that no other ovoids exist in PG(3,q). In fact "One of the most challenging open problems in finite geometry is the determination of ovoids in all finite three dimensional projective spaces".4
Through every point P on the ovoid, there are exactly 
 
 
 
  tangents, and it can be proven that these lines are exactly the lines through P in one specific plane through P. This means that through every point P in the ovoid, there is a unique plane intersecting the ovoid in exactly one point.5 Also, if q is odd or 
 
 
 
  every plane which is not a tangent plane meets the ovoid in a conic.6

more properly the term should be ovaloid and ovoid has a different definition which extends to projective spaces of higher dimension. However, in dimension 3 the two concepts are equivalent and the ovoid terminology is almost universally used, except most notably, in Hirschfeld.
