   Exsecant      Exsecant   The exsecant , also abbreviated exsec , is a trigonometric function defined in terms of the secant function sec(θ):       exsec   (  θ  )    =    sec   (  θ  )    -   1.         exsec  θ       θ   1.     \operatorname{exsec}(\theta)=\sec(\theta)-1.\,     Once important in fields such as surveying , astronomy , and spherical trigonometry , the exsecant function is now little-used. Mainly, this is because the availability of calculators and computers has removed the need for trigonometric tables of specialized functions such as this one.  A related function is the excosecant ( excsc ), the exsecant of the complementary angle:       excsc   (  θ  )    =   exsec   (    π  /  2   -  θ   )    =    csc   (  θ  )    -   1.           excsc  θ    exsec      π  2   θ             θ   1.      \operatorname{excsc}(\theta)=\operatorname{exsec}(\pi/2-\theta)=\csc(\theta)-1.\!     The reason to define a special function for the exsecant is similar to the rationale for the versine : for small angles  θ , the sec( θ ) function approaches one , and so using the above formula for the exsecant will involve the subtraction of two nearly equal quantities and exacerbate roundoff errors. Thus, a table of the secant function would need a very high accuracy to be used for the exsecant, making a specialized exsecant table useful. Even with a computer, floating point errors can be problematic for exsecants of small angles. A more accurate formula in this limit would be to use the identity:        exsec   (  θ  )    =    1  -   cos   (  θ  )      cos   (  θ  )     =    versin   (  θ  )     cos   (  θ  )     =   2    sin  2    (   θ  /  2   )     sec   (  θ  )      .         exsec  θ       1    θ      θ            versin  θ     θ           2    superscript   2     θ  2      θ       \operatorname{exsec}(\theta)=\frac{1-\cos(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}=\frac{%
 \operatorname{versin}(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}=2\sin^{2}(\theta/2)\sec(\theta).     Prior to the availability of computers, this would require time-consuming multiplications.  The name exsecant can be understood from a graphical construction, at right, of the various trigonometric functions from a unit circle , such as was used historically. sec( θ ) is the secant      O  E   ¯     normal-¯    O  E     \overline{OE}   , and the exsecant is the portion     D  E   ¯     normal-¯    D  E     \overline{DE}   of this secant that lies exterior to the circle ( ex is Latin for out of ).
