   (R)-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase      (R)-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase   In enzymology , a (R)-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-6-hydroxynicotine + H 2 O + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-(6-hydroxypyridin-3-yl)-4-(methylamino)butan-1-one + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (R)-6-hydroxynicotine , H 2 O , and O 2 , whereas its two products are 1-(6-hydroxypyridin-3-yl)-4-(methylamino)butan-1-one and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-6-hydroxynicotine:oxygen oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include D-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase , and 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase . It employs one cofactor , FAD .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
