(R)-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase




(R)-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase

In enzymology, a (R)-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(R)-6-hydroxynicotine + H2O + O2

 
  1-(6-hydroxypyridin-3-yl)-4-(methylamino)butan-1-one + H2O2


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (R)-6-hydroxynicotine, H2O, and O2, whereas its two products are 1-(6-hydroxypyridin-3-yl)-4-(methylamino)butan-1-one and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-6-hydroxynicotine:oxygen oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include D-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase, and 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase. It employs one cofactor, FAD.
