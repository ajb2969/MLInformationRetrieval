   Valine N-monooxygenase      Valine N-monooxygenase   Valine N-monooxygenase (, CYP79D1 , CYP79D2 ) is an enzyme with system name L-valine,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (N-hydroxylating) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   L-valine + 2 O 2 + 2 NADPH + 2 H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (E)-2-methylpropanal oxime + 2 NADP + + CO 2 + 3 H 2 O (overall reaction)  (1a) L- valine + O 2 + NADPH + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-hydroxy-L-valine + NADP + + H 2 O  (1b) N-hydroxy-L-valine + O2 + NADPH + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N,N-dihydroxy-L-valine + NADP + + H 2 O  (1c) N,N-dihydroxy-L-valine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (E)-2-methylpropanal oxime + CO 2 + H 2 O (spontaneous reaction)   Valine N-monooxygenase is a heme - thiolate protein (P-450).
