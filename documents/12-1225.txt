In geometry , a pinch point or cuspidal point is a type of singular point on an algebraic surface .  The equation for the surface near a pinch point may be put in the form       f   (  u  ,  v  ,  w  )    =     u  2   -   v   w  2     +   [  4  ]          f   u  v  w         superscript  u  2     v   superscript  w  2      delimited-[]  4      f(u,v,w)=u^{2}-vw^{2}+[4]\,     where [4] denotes terms of degree 4 or more and   v   v   v   is not a square in the ring of functions.  For example the surface       1  -   2  x    +   x  2    -   y   z  2     =  0            1    2  x     superscript  x  2      y   superscript  z  2     0    1-2x+x^{2}-yz^{2}=0   near the point    (  1  ,  0  ,  0  )     1  0  0    (1,0,0)   , meaning in coordinates vanishing at that point, has the form above. In fact, if     u  =   1  -  x    ,   v  =  y      formulae-sequence    u    1  x      v  y     u=1-x,v=y   and    w  =  z      w  z    w=z   then {    u  ,  v  ,  w     u  v  w    u,v,w   } is a system of coordinates vanishing at    (  1  ,  0  ,  0  )     1  0  0    (1,0,0)   then       1  -   2  x    +   x  2    -   y   z  2     =     (   1  -  x   )   2   -   y   z  2     =    u  2   -   v   w  2                 1    2  x     superscript  x  2      y   superscript  z  2        superscript    1  x   2     y   superscript  z  2             superscript  u  2     v   superscript  w  2        1-2x+x^{2}-yz^{2}=(1-x)^{2}-yz^{2}=u^{2}-vw^{2}   is written in the canonical form.  The simplest example of a pinch point is the hypersurface defined by the equation      u  2   -   v   w  2     =  0         superscript  u  2     v   superscript  w  2     0    u^{2}-vw^{2}=0   called Whitney umbrella .  The pinch point (in this case the origin) is a limit of normal crossings singular points (the   v   v   v   -axis in this case). These singular points are intimately related in the sense that in order to resolve the pinch point singularity one must blow-up the whole   v   v   v   -axis and not only the pinch point.
