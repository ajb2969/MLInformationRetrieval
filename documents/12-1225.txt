The equation for the surface near a pinch point may be put in the form



where [4] denotes terms of degree 4 or more and 
 
 
 
  is not a square in the ring of functions.
For example the surface 
 
 
 
  near the point 
 
 
 
 , meaning in coordinates vanishing at that point, has the form above. In fact, if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then {
 
 
 
 } is a system of coordinates vanishing at 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is written in the canonical form.
The simplest example of a pinch point is the hypersurface defined by the equation 
 
 
 
  called Whitney umbrella.
The pinch point (in this case the origin) is a limit of normal crossings singular points (the 
 
 
 
 -axis in this case). These singular points are intimately related in the sense that in order to resolve the pinch point singularity one must blow-up the whole 
 
 
 
 -axis and not only the pinch point.
