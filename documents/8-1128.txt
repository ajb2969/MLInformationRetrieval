   Bearing capacity      Bearing capacity   In geotechnical engineering , bearing capacity is the capacity of soil to support the loads applied to the ground. The bearing capacity of soil is the maximum average contact pressure between the foundation and the soil which should not produce shear failure in the soil. Ultimate bearing capacity is the theoretical maximum pressure which can be supported without failure; allowable bearing capacity is the ultimate bearing capacity divided by a factor of safety. Sometimes, on soft soil sites, large settlements may occur under loaded foundations without actual shear failure occurring; in such cases, the allowable bearing capacity is based on the maximum allowable settlement.  There are three modes of failure that limit bearing capacity: general shear failure, local shear failure, and punching shear failure.  Introduction  A foundation is the part of a structure which transmits the weight of the structure to the ground. All structures constructed on land are supported on foundations. A foundation is, therefore, a connecting link between the structure proper and the ground which supports it.  General shear failure  The general shear failure case is the one normally analyzed. Prevention against other failure modes is accounted for implicitly in settlement calculations. 1 There are many different methods for computing when this failure will occur.  Terzaghi's Bearing Capacity Theory  Karl von Terzaghi was the first to present a comprehensive theory for the evaluation of the ultimate bearing capacity of rough shallow foundations. This theory states that a foundation is shallow if its depth is less than or equal to its width. 2 Later investigations, however, have suggested that foundations with a depth, measured from the ground surface, equal to 3 to 4 times their width may be defined as shallow foundations. 3  Terzaghi developed a method for determining bearing capacity for the general shear failure case in 1943. The equations, which take into account soil cohesion, soil friction, surcharge, and self-weight, are given below.

He also included depth factors and inclination factors. For more information click here .
