Gauss's lemma (Riemannian geometry)

In Riemannian geometry, Gauss's lemma asserts that any sufficiently small sphere centered at a point in a Riemannian manifold is perpendicular to every geodesic through the point. More formally, let M be a Riemannian manifold, equipped with its Levi-Civita connection, and p a point of M. The exponential map is a mapping from the tangent space at p to M:


 
  which is a diffeomorphism in a neighborhood of zero. Gauss' lemma asserts that the image of a sphere of sufficiently small radius in TpM under the exponential map is perpendicular to all geodesics originating at p. The lemma allows the exponential map to be understood as a radial isometry, and is of fundamental importance in the study of geodesic convexity and normal coordinates.
Introduction
We define the exponential map at 
 
 
 
  by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the unique geodesic with 
 
 
 
  and tangent 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is chosen small enough so that for every 
 
 
 
  the geodesic 
 
 
 
  is defined in 1. So, if 
 
 
 
  is complete, then, by the Hopfâ€“Rinow theorem, 
 
 
 
  is defined on the whole tangent space.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a curve differentiable in 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
 , it is clear that we can choose 
 
 
 
 . In this case, by the definition of the differential of the exponential in 
 
 
 
  applied over 
 
 
 
 , we obtain:


 
  So (with the right identification 
 
 
 
 ) the differential of 
 
 
 
  is the identity. By the implicit function theorem, 
 
 
 
  is a diffeomorphism on a neighborhood of 
 
 
 
 . The Gauss Lemma now tells that 
 
 
 
  is also a radial isometry.
The exponential map is a radial isometry
Let 
 
 
 
 . In what follows, we make the identification 
 
 
 
 .
Gauss's Lemma states: Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Then, 
 
 

For 
 
 
 
 , this lemma means that 
 
 
 
  is a radial isometry in the following sense: let 
 
 
 
 , i.e. such that 
 
 
 
  is well defined. And let 
 
 
 
 . Then the exponential 
 
 
 
  remains an isometry in 
 
 
 
 , and, more generally, all along the geodesic 
 
 
 
  (in so far as 
 
 
 
  is well defined)! Then, radially, in all the directions permitted by the domain of definition of 
 
 
 
 , it remains an isometry.

Proof
Recall that



We proceed in three steps:



 : let us construct a curve



 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
 , we can put 
 
 
 
 . We find that, thanks to the identification we have made, and since we are only taking equivalence classes of curves, it is possible to choose 
 
 
 
  (these are exactly the same curves, but shifted because of the domain of definition 
 
 
 
 ; however, the identification allows us to gather them around 
 
 
 
 . Hence,



Now let us calculate the scalar product 
 
 
 
 .
We separate 
 
 
 
  into a component 
 
 
 
  parallel to 
 
 
 
  and a component 
 
 
 
  normal to 
 
 
 
 . In particular, we put 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
The preceding step implies directly:










We must therefore show that the second term is null, because, according to Gauss's Lemma, we must have:






 :

 Let us define the curve


 
  Note that



Let us put:



and we calculate:


 
  and


 
  Hence


 
  We can now verify that this scalar product is actually independent of the variable 
 
 
 
 , and therefore that, for example:


 
  because, according to what has been given above:


 
  being given that the differential is a linear map. This will therefore prove the lemma.

We verify that 

: this is a direct calculation. Since the maps 
 
 
 
  are geodesics,



 
  Since the maps 
 
 
 
  are geodesics, the function 
 
 
 
  is constant. Thus,
