   Ehrenfest equations      Ehrenfest equations   Ehrenfest equations — equations which describe changes in specific heat capacity and derivatives of specific volume in second-order phase transitions . '' Clausius–Clapeyron relation does not make sense for second-order phase transitions'', 1 as both specific heat capacity and specific volume do not change in second-order phase transitions.  Quantitative consideration  Ehrenfest equations are the consequence of continuity of specific entropy   s   s   s   and specific volume   v   v   v   , which are first derivatives of specific Gibbs free energy - in second-order phase transitions. If we consider specific entropy   s   s   s   as a function of temperature and pressure , then its differential is:     d  s   =      (    ∂  s    ∂  T    )   P   d  T   +     (    ∂  s    ∂  P    )   T   d  P          d  s        subscript      s     T    P   d  T      subscript      s     P    T   d  P      ds=\left({{{\partial s}\over{\partial T}}}\right)_{P}dT+\left({{{\partial s}%
 \over{\partial P}}}\right)_{T}dP   . As       (    ∂  s    ∂  T    )   P   =    c  P   T    ,     (    ∂  s    ∂  P    )   T   =   -    (    ∂  v    ∂  T    )   P        formulae-sequence     subscript      s     T    P      subscript  c  P   T       subscript      s     P    T      subscript      v     T    P       \left({{{\partial s}\over{\partial T}}}\right)_{P}={{c_{P}}\over T},\left({{{%
 \partial s}\over{\partial P}}}\right)_{T}=-\left({{{\partial v}\over{\partial T%
 }}}\right)_{P}   , then differential of specific entropy also is:       d   s  i    =      c   i  P    T   d  T   -     (    ∂   v  i     ∂  T    )   P   d  P          d   subscript  s  i           subscript  c    i  P    T   d  T      subscript       subscript  v  i      T    P   d  P      d{s_{i}}={{c_{iP}}\over T}dT-\left({{{\partial v_{i}}\over{\partial T}}}\right%
 )_{P}dP     Where    i  =  1      i  1    i=1   and    i  =  2      i  2    i=2   are the two phases which transit one into other. Due to continuity of specific entropy, the following holds in second-order phase transitions     d   s  1    =   d   s  2          d   subscript  s  1      d   subscript  s  2      {ds_{1}}={ds_{2}}   . So,        (    c   2  P    -   c   1  P     )     d  T   T    =    [     (    ∂   v  2     ∂  T    )   P   -    (    ∂   v  1     ∂  T    )   P    ]   d  P            subscript  c    2  P     subscript  c    1  P         d  T   T       delimited-[]     subscript       subscript  v  2      T    P    subscript       subscript  v  1      T    P     d  P     \left({c_{2P}-c_{1P}}\right){{dT}\over T}=\left[{\left({{{\partial v_{2}}\over%
 {\partial T}}}\right)_{P}-\left({{{\partial v_{1}}\over{\partial T}}}\right)_{%
 P}}\right]dP     Therefore, the first Ehrenfest equation:       Δ   c  P    =     T  ⋅  Δ    (    (    ∂  v    ∂  T    )   P   )    ⋅    d  P    d  T           normal-Δ   subscript  c  P     normal-⋅     normal-⋅  T  normal-Δ    subscript      v     T    P        d  P     d  T       {\Delta c_{P}=T\cdot\Delta\left({\left({{{\partial v}\over{\partial T}}}\right%
 )_{P}}\right)\cdot{{dP}\over{dT}}}     The second Ehrenfest equation is got in a like manner, but specific entropy is considered as function of temperature and specific volume:       Δ   c  V    =   -     T  ⋅  Δ    (    (    ∂  P    ∂  T    )   v   )    ⋅    d  v    d  T            normal-Δ   subscript  c  V       normal-⋅     normal-⋅  T  normal-Δ    subscript      P     T    v        d  v     d  T        {\Delta c_{V}=-T\cdot\Delta\left({\left({{{\partial P}\over{\partial T}}}%
 \right)_{v}}\right)\cdot{{dv}\over{dT}}}     The third Ehrenfest equation is got in a like manner, but specific entropy is considered as function of   v   v   v   и   P   P   P   .       Δ    (    ∂  v    ∂  T    )   P    =    Δ   (    (    ∂  P    ∂  T    )   v   )    ⋅    d  v    d  P           normal-Δ   subscript      v     T    P     normal-⋅    normal-Δ   subscript      P     T    v        d  v     d  P       {\Delta\left({{{\partial v}\over{\partial T}}}\right)_{P}=\Delta\left({\left({%
 {{\partial P}\over{\partial T}}}\right)_{v}}\right)\cdot{{dv}\over{dP}}}     Continuity of specific volume as of function of   T   T   T   and   P   P   P   gives the fourth Ehrenfest equation:       Δ    (    ∂  v    ∂  T    )   P    =   -    Δ   (    (    ∂  v    ∂  P    )   T   )    ⋅    d  P    d  T            normal-Δ   subscript      v     T    P       normal-⋅    normal-Δ   subscript      v     P    T        d  P     d  T        {\Delta\left({{{\partial v}\over{\partial T}}}\right)_{P}=-\Delta\left({\left(%
 {{{\partial v}\over{\partial P}}}\right)_{T}}\right)\cdot{{dP}\over{dT}}}     Application  Derivatives of Gibbs free energy are not always finite. Transitions between different magnetic states of metals can't be described by Ehrenfest equations.
