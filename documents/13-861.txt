Ehrenfest equations

Ehrenfest equations — equations which describe changes in specific heat capacity and derivatives of specific volume in second-order phase transitions. '' Clausius–Clapeyron relation does not make sense for second-order phase transitions'',1 as both specific heat capacity and specific volume do not change in second-order phase transitions.
Quantitative consideration
Ehrenfest equations are the consequence of continuity of specific entropy 
 
 
 
  and specific volume 
 
 
 
 , which are first derivatives of specific Gibbs free energy - in second-order phase transitions. If we consider specific entropy 
 
 
 
  as a function of temperature and pressure, then its differential is: 
 
 
 
 . As 
 
 
 
 , then differential of specific entropy also is:



Where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the two phases which transit one into other. Due to continuity of specific entropy, the following holds in second-order phase transitions
 
 
 
 . So,



Therefore, the first Ehrenfest equation:



The second Ehrenfest equation is got in a like manner, but specific entropy is considered as function of temperature and specific volume:



The third Ehrenfest equation is got in a like manner, but specific entropy is considered as function of 
 
 
 
  и 
 
 
 
 .



Continuity of specific volume as of function of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  gives the fourth Ehrenfest equation:



Application
Derivatives of Gibbs free energy are not always finite. Transitions between different magnetic states of metals can't be described by Ehrenfest equations.
