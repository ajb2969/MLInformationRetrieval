Frobenius covariant

In matrix theory, the Frobenius covariants of a square matrix

 
  are special polynomials of it, namely projection matrices Ai associated with the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of 
 
 
 
 .1 They are named after the mathematician Ferdinand Frobenius.
Each covariant is a projection on the eigenspace associated with the eigenvalue . Frobenius covariants are the coefficients of Sylvester's formula, which expresses a function of a matrix

 
  as a matrix polynomial, namely a linear combination of that function's values on the eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
 .
Formal definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a diagonalizable matrix with 
 
 
 
  distinct eigenvalues, λ1, …, λk. The Frobenius covariant Ai, for i = 1,…, k, is the matrix


 
  It is essentially the Lagrange polynomial with matrix argument.
Computing the covariants
The Frobenius covariants of a matrix 
 
 
 
  can be obtained from any eigendecomposition  SDS−1}}, where 
 
 
 
  is non-singular and 
 
 
 
  is diagonal with  λi}}. If 
 
 
 
  has no multiple eigenvalues, then let ci be the 
 
 
 
 th left eigenvector of 
 
 
 
 , that is, the 
 
 
 
 th column of 
 
 
 
 ; and let ri be the 
 
 
 
 th right eigenvector of 
 
 
 
 , namely the 
 
 
 
 th row of 
 
 
−1. Then  ci ri}}.
If 
 
 
 
  has multiple eigenvalues, then  Σj cj rj}}, where the sum is over all rows and columns associated with the eigenvalue λi.2
Example
Consider the two-by-two matrix:


 
  This matrix has two eigenvalues, 5 and −2. The corresponding eigen decomposition is


 
  Hence the Frobenius covariants, manifestly projections, are


 
  with
