Antecedent (logic)




Antecedent (logic)

An antecedent is the first half of a hypothetical proposition, whenever the if-clause precedes the then-clause. It is also known for a person's principles to a possible or hypothetical issue.
Examples:

If P, then Q.

This is a nonlogical formulation of a hypothetical proposition. In this case, the antecedent is P, and the consequent is Q. In an implication, if 
 
 
 
  implies 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is called the antecedent and 
 
 
 
  is called the consequent.1

If X is a man, then X is mortal.

"X is a man" is the antecedent for this proposition.

If men have walked on the moon, then I am the king of France.

Here, "men have walked on the moon" is the antecedent.
