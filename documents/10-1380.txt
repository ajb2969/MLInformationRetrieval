   Biphenyl-2,3-diol 1,2-dioxygenase      Biphenyl-2,3-diol 1,2-dioxygenase   Biphenyl-2,3-diol 1,2-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   biphenyl-2,3-diol + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate + H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are biphenyl-2,3-diol and oxygen , whereas its two products are 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate and water .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is biphenyl-2,3-diol:oxygen 1,2-oxidoreductase (decyclizing) . Other names in common use include 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase , and biphenyl-2,3-diol dioxygenase . This enzyme participates in gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation and biphenyl degradation .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 16 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
