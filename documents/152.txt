   2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-arabinonate dehydratase      2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-arabinonate dehydratase   In enzymology , a 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-arabinonate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-arabinonate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2,5-dioxopentanoate + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-arabinonate , and two products , 2,5-dioxopentanoate and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-arabinonate hydro-lyase (2,5-dioxopentanoate-forming) . Other names in common use include 2-keto-3-deoxy-L-arabinonate dehydratase , and 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-arabinonate hydro-lyase . This enzyme participates in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism .
