   Behavior of DEVS      Behavior of DEVS   Behaviors of a given DEVS model is a set of sequences of timed events including null events, called event segments which make the model move one state to another within a set of legal states. To define this way, the concept of a set of illegal state as well a set of legal states are needed to be introduced.  In addition, since the behaviors of a given DEVS model needs to define how the state transition change both when time is passed by and when an event occurs, it has been described by a much general formalism, called general system [ZPK00 ]. In this article, we use a sub-class of General System formalism, called timed event system instead.  Depending on how to define the total state and its external state transition function of DEVS , two ways to define the behavior of a DEVS model using Timed Event System . Since behavior of a coupled DEVS model is defined as an atomic DEVS model, behavior of coupled DEVS class is defined by timed event system.  == View 1: total states = states * elapsed times == Suppose that a DEVS model, $\mathcal{M}= $ has   the external state transition $\delta_{ext}:Q \times X \rightarrow S$ .  the total state set $Q=\{(s,t_e)| s \in S, t_e \in (\mathbb{T} \cap [0, ta(s)])\}$ where $t_e$ denotes elapsed time since last event and $\mathbb{T}=[0,\infty)$ denotes the set of non-negative real numbers, and   Then the DEVS model, $\mathcal{M}$ is a Timed Event System  $\mathcal{G}=  $ where    The event set $Z=X \cup Y^\phi$ .  The state set $Q=Q_A \cup Q_N$ where $Q_N=\{\bar{s} \not \in S \}$ .  The set of initial states $\,Q_0 = \{(s_0,0)\}$ .  The set of accepting states $Q_A = \mathcal{M}.Q.$  The set of state trajectories \Delta \subseteq Q \times \Omega_{Z,[t_l,t_u]}   \times Q is defined for two different cases $$q \in Q_N$$ and $q \in Q_A$ . For an non-accepting state $q \in Q_N$ , there is no change together with any even segment $\omega \in \Omega_{Z,[t_l,t_u]}$ so $(q,\omega,q) \in \Delta.$  For a total state $q=(s,t_e) \in Q_A$ at time $t \in \mathbb{T}$ and an event segment  $\omega \in \Omega_{Z,[t_l,t_u]}$ as follows. If unit event segment  $\omega$ is the null event segment , i.e. $\omega=\epsilon_{[t, t+dt]}$   $\, (q, \omega, (s, t_e+dt)) \in \Delta.\,$   If unit event segment  $\omega$ is a timed event  $\omega=(x, t)$ where the event is an input event $x \in X$ ,   $(q, \omega, (\delta_{ext}(q,x), 0)) \in \Delta.$   If unit event segment  $\omega$ is a timed event  $\omega=(y, t)$ where the event is an output event or the unobservable event $y \in Y^\phi$ ,   $\begin{cases}
 (q, \omega,(\delta_{int}(s), 0)) \in \Delta& \textrm{if } ~ t_e = ta(s), y = \lambda(s)\\
 (q, \omega, \bar{s})                      & \textrm{otherwise}.
 \end{cases}$     Computer algorithms to simulate this view of behavior are available at Simulation Algorithms for Atomic DEVS .  ==View 2: total states = states * lifespans * elapsed times== Suppose that a DEVS model, $\mathcal{M}= $ has   the total state set $Q=\{(s,t_s, t_e)| s \in S, t_s\in \mathbb{T}^\infty, t_e \in (\mathbb{T} \cap [0, t_s])\}$ where $t_s$ denotes lifespan of state $s$ , $t_e$ denotes elapsed time since last $t_s$ update, and $\mathbb{T}^\infty=[0,\infty) \cup \{ \infty \}$ denotes the set of non-negative real numbers plus infinity,  the external state transition is $\delta_{ext}:Q \times X \rightarrow S \times \{0,1\}$ .   Then the DEVS  $Q=\mathcal{D}$ is a timed event system $\mathcal{G}=  $ where    The event set $Z=X \cup Y^\phi$ .  The state set $Q=Q_A \cup Q_N$ where $Q_N=\{ \bar{s} \not \in S \}$ .  The set of initial states $\,Q_0 = \{(s_0,ta(s_0),0)\}$ .  The set of acceptance states $Q_A = \mathcal{M}.Q$ .  The set of state trajectories \Delta \subseteq Q \times \Omega_{Z,[t_l,t_u]}   \times Q is depending on two cases $$q \in Q_N$$ and $q \in Q_A$ . For a non-accepting state $q \in Q_N$ , there is no changes together with any segment $\omega \in \Omega_{Z,[t_l,t_u]}$ so $(q,\omega,q) \in \Delta.$  For a total state $q=(s,t_s, t_e) \in Q_A$ at time $t \in \mathbb{T}$ and an event segment  $\omega \in \Omega_{Z,[t_l,t_u]}$ as follows. If unit event segment  $\omega$ is the null event segment , i.e. $\omega=\epsilon_{[t, t+dt]}$   $(q, \omega, (s, t_s, t_e+dt)) \in \Delta.$   If unit event segment  $\omega$ is a timed event  $\omega=(x, t)$ where the event is an input event $x \in X$ ,   $\begin{cases}
 (q, \omega, (s', ta(s'), 0))\in \Delta& \textrm{if  } ~\delta_{ext}(s,t_s,t_e,x)=(s',1),\\
 (q, \omega, (s', t_s, t_e))\in \Delta& \textrm{otherwise, i.e. }  ~\delta_{ext}(s,t_s,t_e,x)=(s',0). 
 \end{cases}$   If unit event segment  $\omega$ is a timed event  $\omega=(y, t)$ where the event is an output event or the unobservable event $y \in Y^\phi$ ,   $\begin{cases}
 (q, \omega, (s', ta(s'),0)) \in \Delta& \textrm{if } ~t_e = t_s, y = \lambda(s), \delta_{int}(s)=s',\\
 (q, \omega, \bar{s} )\in \Delta& \textrm{otherwise}.
 \end{cases}$     Computer algorithms to simulate this view of behavior are available at Simulation Algorithms for Atomic DEVS .  Comparison of View1 and View2  Features of View1  View1 has been introduced by Zeigler [Zeigler84 ] in which given a total state $q=(s,t_e) \in Q$ and   $\, ta(s)=\sigma$   where $\sigma$ is the remaining time [Zeigler84 ] [ZPK00 ]. In other words, the set of partial states is indeed $S=\{(d,\sigma)| d \in S', \sigma \in \mathbb{T}^\infty \}$ where $S'$ is a state set.  When a DEVS model receives an input event $x \in X$ , View1 resets the elapsed time $t_e$ by zero, if the DEVS model needs to ignore $x$ in terms of the lifespan control, modellers have to update the remaining time   $\, \sigma = \sigma - t_e$   in the external state transition function $\delta_{ext}$ that is the responsibility of the modellers.  Since the number of possible values of $\sigma$ is the same as the number of possible input events coming to the DEVS model, that is unlimited. As a result, the number of states $s=(d, \sigma) \in S$ is also unlimited that is the reason why View2 has been proposed.  If we don't care the finite-vertex reachability graph of a DEVS model, View1 has an advantage of simplicity for treating the elapsed time $t_e=0$ every time any input event arrives into the DEVS model. But disadvantage might be modelers of DEVS should know how to manage $\sigma$ as above, which is not explicitly explained in $\delta_{ext}$ itself but in $\Delta$ .  Features of View2  View2 has been introduced by Hwang and Zeigler [HZ06 ] [HZ07 ] in which given a total state $q=(s, t_s, t_e) \in Q$ , the remaining time, $\sigma$ is computed as   $\, \sigma = t_s - t_e.$   When a DEVS model receives an input event $x \in X$ , View2 resets the elapsed time $t_e$ by zero only if $\delta_{ext}(q,x)=(s',1)$ . If the DEVS model needs to ignore $x$ in terms of the lifespan control, modellers can use $\delta_{ext}(q,x)=(s',0)$ .  Unlike View1, since the remaining time $\sigma$ is not component of $S$ in nature, if the number of states, i.e. $|S|$ is finite, we can draw a finite-vertex (as well as edge) state-transition diagram [HZ06 ] [HZ07 ]. As a result, we can abstract behavior of such a DEVS-class network, for example SP-DEVS and FD-DEVS , as a finite-vertex graph, called reachability graph [HZ06 ] [HZ07 ].
