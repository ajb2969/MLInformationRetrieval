Ind-scheme

In algebraic geometry, an ind-scheme is a set-valued functor that can be written (represented) as a direct limit (i.e., inductive limit) of closed embedding of schemes.
Examples



 
  is an ind-scheme.
Perhaps the most famous example of an ind-scheme is an infinite grassmannian (which is a quotient of the loop group of an algebraic group G.)
