G-measure

In mathematics, a G-measure is a measure 
 
 
 
  that can be represented as the weak-∗ limit of a sequence of measurable functions 
 
 
 
 . A classic example is the Riesz product



where 
 
 
 
 . The weak-∗ limit of this product is a measure on the circle 
 
 
 
 , in the sense that for

History
It was Keane1 who first showed that Riesz products can be regarded as strong mixing invariant measure under the shift operator

 
 . These were later generalized by Brown and Dooley 2 to Riesz products of the form
