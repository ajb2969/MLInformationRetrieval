   Boolean hierarchy      Boolean hierarchy   The boolean hierarchy is the hierarchy of boolean combinations ( intersection , union and complementation ) of NP sets. Equivalently, the boolean hierarchy can be described as the class of boolean circuits over NP predicates. A collapse of the boolean hierarchy would imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy . 1  Formal definition  BH is defined as follows: 2   BH 1 is NP .  BH 2k is the class of languages which are the intersection of a language in BH 2k-1 and a language in coNP .  BH 2k+1 is the class of languages which are the union of a language in BH 2k and a language in NP .  BH is the union of the BH i   Derived classes   DP (Difference Polynomial Time) is BH 2 . 3   Equivalent definitions  Defining the conjunction and the disjunction of classes as follows allows for more compact definitions. The conjunction of two classes contains the languages that are the intersection of a language of the first class and a language of the second class. Disjunction is defined in a similar way with the union in place of the intersection.   C ∧ D = { A ∩ B | A ∈ C   B ∈ D }  C ∨ D = { A ∪ B | A ∈ C   B ∈ D }   According to this definition, DP=NP ∧ coNP. The other classes of the Boolean hierarchy can be defined as follows.       B   H   2  k     =    c  o  N  P   ∧   B   H    2  k   -  1            B   subscript  H    2  k         c  o  N  P     B   subscript  H      2  k   1        BH_{2k}=coNP\wedge BH_{2k-1}        B   H    2  k   +  1     =    N  P   ∨   B   H   2  k            B   subscript  H      2  k   1         N  P     B   subscript  H    2  k        BH_{2k+1}=NP\vee BH_{2k}     The following equalities can be used as alternative definitions of the classes of the Boolean hierarchy: 4      B   H   2  k     =    ⋁   i  =  1   k    D  P          B   subscript  H    2  k       superscript   subscript     i  1    k     D  P      BH_{2k}=\bigvee_{i=1}^{k}DP        B   H    2  k   +  1     =    N  P   ∨    ⋁   i  =  1   k    D  P           B   subscript  H      2  k   1         N  P     superscript   subscript     i  1    k     D  P       BH_{2k+1}=NP\vee\bigvee_{i=1}^{k}DP     Alternatively, 5 for every k ≥ 3:       B   H  k    =    D  P   ∨   B   H   k  -  2            B   subscript  H  k        D  P     B   subscript  H    k  2        BH_{k}=DP\vee BH_{k-2}     Hardness  Hardness for classes of the Boolean hierarchy can be proved by showing a reduction from a number of instances of an arbitrary NP-complete problem A. In particular, given a sequence {x 1 , ... x m } of instances of A such that x i ∈ A implies x i-1 ∈ A, a reduction is required that produces an instance y such that y ∈ B if and only if the number of x i ∈ A is odd or even: 6   BH 2k -hardness is proved if m=2k and the number of x i ∈ A is odd  BH 2k+1 -hardness is proved if m=2k+1 and the number of x i ∈ A is even   Such reductions work for every fixed k. If such reductions exist for arbitrary k, the problem is hard for P NP[O(log n)] .  References    "  Category:Hierarchy     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
