Draft:Multiplicity theory

In algebra, the multiplicity theory concerns the multiplicity of a module M at an ideal I (often a maximal ideal)
$$\mathbf{e}_I(M)$$. The notion of the multiplicity of a module is a generalization of the degree of a projective variety. By Serre's intersection formula, it is linked to an intersection multiplicity in the intersection theory.
The main focus of the theory is to detect and measure a singular point of an algebraic variety (cf. resolution of singularities). Because of this aspect, the valuation theory, Rees algebras and integral closure are intimately connected to the multiplicity theory.
Multiplicity of a module
Let R be a positively graded ring such that R is generated as R0-algebra and R0 is Artinian. Note R has finite Krull dimension d. Let M be a finitely generated R-module and FM(t) its the Hilbert–Poincaré series. Since FM(t) is a rational function, it can be written as
$$F(t) = \sum_1^d {a_{d-i} \over (1 - t)^d} + r(t).$$ where r(t) is a polynomial. Note that $a_{d-i}$ are the coefficients of the Hilbert polynomial of M expanded in binomial coefficients. We let
$$\mathbf{e}(M) = a_0$$. It is, by definition, the multiplicity of M. It is additive on exact sequences since Hilbert–Poincaré series are additive.
