   Pentagonal orthobicupola      Pentagonal orthobicupola   In geometry , the pentagonal orthobicupola is one of the Johnson solids ( J 30 ). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by joining two pentagonal cupolae ( J 5 ) along their decagonal bases, matching like faces. A 36-degree rotation of one cupola before the joining yields a pentagonal gyrobicupola ( J 31 ).  The pentagonal orthobicupola is the third in an infinite set of orthobicupolae .  Formulae  The following formulae for volume and surface area can be used if all faces are regular , with edge length a : 1     V  =    1  3    (   5  +   4   5     )    a  3    ≈   4.64809...   a  3          V      1  3     5    4    5      superscript  a  3           4.64809...   superscript  a  3       V=\frac{1}{3}(5+4\sqrt{5})a^{3}\approx 4.64809...a^{3}       A  =    (   10  +     5  2    (  10  +   5   +    75  +  30   5   )        )    a  2    ≈   17.7711...   a  2          A      10     fragments    5  2    fragments  normal-(  10     5       fragments  75   30    5   normal-)         superscript  a  2           17.7711...   superscript  a  2       A=(10+\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}(10+\sqrt{5}+\sqrt{75+30\sqrt{5})}})a^{2}\approx 17.771%
