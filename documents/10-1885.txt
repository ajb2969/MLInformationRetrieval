4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase

In enzymology, a 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA + H2O 
 
 
 
  4-hydroxybenzoyl CoA + chloride
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA and H2O, whereas its two products are 4-hydroxybenzoyl CoA and chloride.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on halide bonds in carbon-halide compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-chlorobenzoyl CoA chlorohydrolase. This enzyme participates in 2,4-dichlorobenzoate degradation.
