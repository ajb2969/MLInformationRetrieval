   Malate dehydrogenase (quinone)      Malate dehydrogenase (quinone)   In enzymology , a malate dehydrogenase (quinone) (), formerly malate dehydrogenase (acceptor) (EC 1.1.99.16), is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-malate + a quinone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxaloacetate + reduced quinone   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-malate and a quinone , whereas its two products are oxaloacetate and reduced quinone.  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with a quinone as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-malate:quinone oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include FAD-dependent malate-vitamin K reductase , malate-vitamin K reductase , and (S)-malate:(quinone) oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism . It employs one cofactor , FAD .  References       "  Category:EC 1.1.5  Category:Flavin enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
