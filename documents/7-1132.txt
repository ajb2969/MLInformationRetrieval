   Dasymeter      Dasymeter   A dasymeter was meant initially as a device to demonstrate the buoyant effect of gases like air; as shown in the pictures on the right. A dasymeter which allows weighing acts as a densimeter used to measure the density of gases .  Principle  The Principle of Archimedes permits to derive a formula which does not rely on any information of volume: A sample, the big sphere in the images on the right, of known mass-density is weighed in vacuum and then immersed into the gas and weighed again. From the known mass density of the sample (sphere) and its two weight-values can be calculated the mass-density of the gas:       density of sphere  density of gas   =    weight of sphere   weight of sphere  -  weight of immersed sphere           density of sphere  density of gas     weight of sphere    weight of sphere  weight of immersed sphere      \frac{\mbox{density of sphere}}{\mbox{density of gas}}=\frac{\mbox{weight of %
 sphere}}{\mbox{weight of sphere}-\mbox{weight of immersed sphere}}\,   (The formula was taken from the article buoyancy and still has to be solved for the density of the gas.)  Construction and Use  It consists of a thin sphere made of glass , ideally with an average density close to that of the gas to be investigated. This sphere is immersed in the gas and weighed .  History of the dasymeter  Was invented in 1650 by Otto von Guericke . Archimedes used a pair of scales which he immersed into water to demonstrate the buoyant effect of water. A dasymeter can be seen as a variant of that pair of scales, only immersed into gas.
