   Baguenaudier      Baguenaudier    Baguenaudier (also known as the Chinese Rings , Cardan's Suspension , Cardano's Rings , Devil's needle or five pillars puzzle) is a disentanglement puzzle featuring a loop which must be disentangled from a sequence of rings on interlinked pillars. 1 The loop can be either string or a rigid structure.  It is thought to have been invented originally in China . The origins are obscure. The ethnographer Stewart Culin related a tradition attributing the puzzle's invention to the 2nd/3rd century Chinese general Zhuge Liang . 2 The name " Baguenaudier " is French for "time-waster". 3 It was used by French peasants as a locking mechanism. 4  Variations of this include The Devil's Staircase , Devil's Halo 5 and the Impossible Staircase . Another similar puzzle is the Giant's Causeway which uses a separate pillar with an embedded ring.  Mathematical solution  Édouard Lucas , the inventor of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, was known to have come up with an elegant solution which used binary and Gray codes , in the same way that his puzzle can be solved. 6 The minimum number of moves to solve an n -ringed problem has been found to be:       a   (  n  )    =   {         2   n  +  1    -  2   3   ,      when  n  is even,           2   n  +  1    -  1   3   ,      when  n  is odd.             a  n    cases       superscript  2    n  1    2   3     when  n  is even,        superscript  2    n  1    1   3     when  n  is odd.      a(n)=\begin{cases}\frac{2^{n+1}-2}{3},&\text{when }n\text{ is even,}\\
 \frac{2^{n+1}-1}{3},&\text{when }n\text{ is odd.}\end{cases}    7  For other formulae, see OEIS  A000975 .
