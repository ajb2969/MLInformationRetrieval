   Thymidylate 5'-phosphatase      Thymidylate 5'-phosphatase   In enzymology , a thymidylate 5'-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   thymidylate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   thymidine + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are thymidylate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are thymidine and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is thymidylate 5'-phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include thymidylate 5'-nucleotidase , deoxythymidylate 5'-nucleotidase , thymidylate nucleotidase , deoxythymidylic 5'-nucleotidase , deoxythymidylate phosphohydrolase , and dTMPase .
