Catechol oxidase (dimerizing)

In enzymology, a catechol oxidase (dimerizing) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4 catechol + 3 O2

 
  2 dibenzo[1,4]dioxin-2,3-dione + 6 H2O
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are catechol and O2, whereas its two products are [[dibenzo[1,4]dioxin-2,3-dione]] and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is catechol:oxygen oxidoreductase (dimerizing).
