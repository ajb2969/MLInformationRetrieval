   Catechol oxidase (dimerizing)      Catechol oxidase (dimerizing)   In enzymology , a catechol oxidase (dimerizing) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4 catechol + 3 O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 dibenzo[1,4]dioxin-2,3-dione + 6 H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are catechol and O 2 , whereas its two products are [[dibenzo[1,4]dioxin-2,3-dione]] and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is catechol:oxygen oxidoreductase (dimerizing) .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
