   Queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase      Queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase   In enzymology , a queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   [tRNA]-guanine + queuine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   [tRNA]-queuine + guanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are tRNA-guanine and queuine , whereas its two products are [tRNA]-queuine and guanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is [tRNA]-guanine:queuine tRNA-D-ribosyltransferase . Other names in common use include tRNA-guanine transglycosylase , guanine insertion enzyme , tRNA transglycosylase , Q-insertase , queuine transfer ribonucleate ribosyltransferase , transfer ribonucleate glycosyltransferase , tRNA guanine transglycosidase , guanine, queuine-tRNA transglycosylase , and tRNA-guanine:queuine tRNA-D-ribosyltransferase .
