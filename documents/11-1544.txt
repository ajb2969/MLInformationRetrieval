   N-acylmannosamine kinase      N-acylmannosamine kinase   In enzymology , a N-acylmannosamine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + N-acyl-D-mannosamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + N-acyl-D-mannosamine 6-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and N-acyl-D-mannosamine , whereas its two products are ADP and N-acyl-D-mannosamine 6-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:N-acyl-D-mannosamine 6-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include acylmannosamine kinase (phosphorylating) , acetylamidodeoxymannokinase , acetylmannosamine kinase , acylaminodeoxymannokinase , acylmannosamine kinase , N-acyl-D-mannosamine kinase , N-acetylmannosamine kinase , and ATP:N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphotransferase . This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
