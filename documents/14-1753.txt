Pure shear

 In mechanics and geology, pure shear is a three-dimensional homogeneous flattening of a body.1 It is an example of irrotational strain in which a body is elongated in one direction while being shortened perpendicularly.2 For soft materials, such as rubber, a strain state of pure shear is often used for characterizing hyperelastic and fracture mechanical behavior. 3 4
Pure shear stress-strain relation
Pure shear stress, denoted 
 
 
 
 , is related to pure shear strain, denoted 
 
 
 
 , by the following equation:5


where 
 
 
 
  is the shear modulus of the material, given by



Here 
 
 
 
  is Young's modulus and 
 
 
 
  is Poisson's ratio. Combining gives
