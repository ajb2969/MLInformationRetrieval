   Pure shear      Pure shear   In mechanics and geology , pure shear is a three-dimensional homogeneous flattening of a body. 1 It is an example of irrotational strain in which a body is elongated in one direction while being shortened perpendicularly . 2 For soft materials, such as rubber, a strain state of pure shear is often used for characterizing hyperelastic and fracture mechanical behavior. 3  4  Pure shear stress-strain relation  Pure shear stress , denoted   τ   τ   \tau   , is related to pure shear strain , denoted   γ   γ   \gamma   , by the following equation: 5     τ  =   γ   G        τ    γ  G     \tau=\gamma G\,     where   G   G   G   is the shear modulus of the material, given by      G  =   E   2   (   1  +  ν   )         G    E    2    1  ν       G=\frac{E}{2(1+\nu)}     Here   E   E   E   is Young's modulus and   ν   ν   \nu   is Poisson's ratio . Combining gives      τ  =    γ  E    2   (   1  +  ν   )         τ      γ  E     2    1  ν       \tau=\frac{\gamma E}{2(1+\nu)}     See also   Simple shear   References  "  Category:Fluid mechanics     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
