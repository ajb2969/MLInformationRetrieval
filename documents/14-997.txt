Information projection

In information theory, the information projection or I-projection of a probability distribution q onto a set of distributions P is



where 
 
 
 
  is the Kullback–Leibler divergence from p to q. Viewing the Kullback–Leibler divergence as a measure of distance, the I-projection 
 
 
 
  is the "closest" distribution to q of all the distributions in P.
