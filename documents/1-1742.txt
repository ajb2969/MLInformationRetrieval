Complement (set theory)




Complement (set theory)

In set theory, a complement of a set A refers to things not in (that is, things outside of) A. The relative complement of A with respect to a set B is the set of elements in B but not in A. When all sets under consideration are considered to be subsets of a given set U, the absolute complement of A is the set of all elements in U but not in A.
Relative complement
If A and B are sets, then the relative complement of A in B,1 also termed the set-theoretic difference of B and A,2 is the set of elements in B, but not in A.

The relative complement of A in B is denoted  according to the ISO 31-11 standard (sometimes written , but this notation is ambiguous, as in some contexts it can be interpreted as the set of all , where b is taken from B and a from A).
Formally



Examples:
:* {1,2,3} ∖ {2,3,4}   =   {1}
:* {2,3,4} ∖ {1,2,3}   =   {4}
:* If 
 
 
 
  is the set of real numbers and 
 
 
 
  is the set of rational numbers, then 
 
 
 
  is the set of irrational numbers.
The following lists some notable properties of relative complements in relation to the set-theoretic operations of union and intersection.
If A, B, and C are sets, then the following identities hold:
:* C ∖ (A ∩ B)  =  (C ∖ A)∪(C ∖ B)
:* C ∖ (A ∪ B)  =  (C ∖ A)∩(C ∖ B)
:* C ∖ (B ∖ A)  =  (C ∩ A)∪(C ∖ B)
[ Alternately written: A ∖ (B ∖ C)  =  (A ∖ B)∪(A ∩ C) ]
:* (B ∖ A) ∩ C  =  (B ∩ C) ∖ A  =  B∩(C ∖ A)
:* (B ∖ A) ∪ C  =  (B ∪ C) ∖ (A ∖ C)
:* A ∖ A  =  Ø
:* Ø ∖ A  =  Ø
:* A ∖ Ø  =  A

If a universe U is defined, then the relative complement of A in U is called the absolute complement (or simply complement) of A, and is denoted by Ac or sometimes A′. The same set often3 is denoted by 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  if U is fixed, that is:

Ac  = U ∖ A.
 

For example, if the universe is the set of integers, then the complement of the set of odd numbers is the set of even numbers.
The following lists some important properties of absolute complements in relation to the set-theoretic operations of union and intersection.
If A and B are subsets of a universe U, then the following identities hold:

Relationships between relative and absolute complements:
 
 :* A ∖ B = A ∩ Bc
:* (A ∖ B)c = Ac ∪ B


The first two complement laws above shows that if A is a non-empty, proper subset of U, then {A, Ac} is a partition of U.
Notation
In the LaTeX typesetting language, the command \setminus6 is usually used for rendering a set difference symbol, which is similar to a backslash symbol. When rendered the \setminus command looks identical to \backslash except that it has a little more space in front and behind the slash, akin to the LaTeX sequence \mathbin{\backslash}. A variant \smallsetminus is available in the amssymb package.
Complements in various programming languages
Some programming languages allow for manipulation of sets as data structures, using these operators or functions to construct the difference of sets a and b:

.NET Framework
a.Except(b);



C++
set_difference(a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), b.end(), result.begin());



Clojure
(clojure.set/difference a b)7



Common Lisp
set-difference, nset-difference8



 F#
Set.difference a b9


or

a - b10



 Falcon
diff = a - b11



Haskell
difference a b

a \\ b12



Java
diff = a.clone();
 
diff.removeAll(b);13



Julia
setdiff14



Mathematica
Complement15



MATLAB
setdiff16



OCaml
Set.S.diff17



Octave
setdiff18



Pascal
SetDifference := a - b;



Perl 5
#for perl version >= 5.10

@a = grep {not $_ ~~ @b} @a;



Perl 6
$A ∖ $B

$A (-) $B # texas version



PHP
array_diff($a, $b);19



Prolog
a(X),\+ b(X).



Python
diff = a.difference(b)20

diff = a - b21



R
setdiff22



Racket
(set-subtract a b)23



Ruby
diff = a - b24



Scala
a.diff(b)25


or

a -- b26



Smalltalk (Pharo)
a difference: b



SQL
 SELECT * FROM A
 

EXCEPT SELECT * FROM B


Unix shell
comm -23 a b27

grep -vf b a # less efficient, but works with small unsorted sets
