   Corank      Corank   In mathematics , corank may refer to any of several related concepts, complementary to the concept of the rank of a mathematical object:   The corank of an    m  Ã—  n      m  n    m\times n    matrix is    m  -  r      m  r    m-r   where   r   r   r   is the rank of the matrix. Equivalently, by the fundamental theorem of linear algebra , it is the dimension of the left nullspace of the matrix.  Generalizing matrices to linear transformations of vector spaces , the corank of a linear transformation is the dimension of the cokernel of the transformation, which is the quotient of the codomain by the image of the transformation.  For a matroid with   n   n   n   elements and matroid rank    r   r   r   , the corank or nullity of the matroid is    n  -  r      n  r    n-r   . In the case of linear matroids this coincides with the matrix corank. In the case of graphic matroids the corank is also known as the circuit rank or cyclomatic number.
