   Hénon-Heiles System      Hénon-Heiles System   (Figure)  Contour plot of the Hénon-Heiles potential   While at Princeton in 1962, Michel Hénon and Carl Heiles worked on the non-linear motion of a star around a galactic center where the motion is restricted to a plane. In 1964 they have published an article 1 titled 'The applicability of the third integral of motion: Some numerical experiments'. Their original idea was to find a third integral of motion in a galactic dynamics. For that purpose they have taken a simplified two-dimensional nonlinear axi-symmetric potential and found that the third integral exist only for a limited number of initial conditions. In the modern perspective these initial conditions which doesn't have the third integral motion are called chaotic orbits.  Introduction  The Hénon-Heiles Potential can be expressed as 2       V   (  x  ,  y  )    =     1  2    (    x  2   +   y  2    )    +   λ   (     x  2   y   -    y  3   3    )           V   x  y          1  2      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2       λ       superscript  x  2   y      superscript  y  3   3        V(x,y)=\frac{1}{2}(x^{2}+y^{2})+\lambda(x^{2}y-\frac{y^{3}}{3})   The Hénon-Heiles Hamiltonian can be written as      H  =     1  2    (    p  x  2   +   p  y  2    )    +    1  2    (    x  2   +   y  2    )    +   λ   (     x  2   y   -    y  3   3    )         H        1  2      superscript   subscript  p  x   2    superscript   subscript  p  y   2         1  2      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2       λ       superscript  x  2   y      superscript  y  3   3        H=\frac{1}{2}(p_{x}^{2}+p_{y}^{2})+\frac{1}{2}(x^{2}+y^{2})+\lambda(x^{2}y-%
 \frac{y^{3}}{3})   The Hénon-Heiles System (HHS) is defined by the following four equations:       x  ˙   =   p  x        normal-˙  x    subscript  p  x     \dot{x}=p_{x}           p  x   ˙   =    -  x   -   2  λ  x  y         normal-˙   subscript  p  x        x     2  λ  x  y      \dot{p_{x}}=-x-2\lambda xy          y  ˙   =   p  y        normal-˙  y    subscript  p  y     \dot{y}=p_{y}           p  y   ˙   =    -  y   -   λ   (    x  2   -   y  2    )          normal-˙   subscript  p  y        y     λ     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2        \dot{p_{y}}=-y-\lambda(x^{2}-y^{2})   In the classical chaos community, the value of the parameter   λ   λ   \lambda   is usually taken as unity. Since HHS is specified in     \R   2     superscript  \R  2    \R^{2}   , we need a Hamiltonian of degrees of freedom two to model it. It can be solved for some cases using Painlevé Analysis.  Quantum Henon-Heiles Hamiltonian  In the quantum case the Henon-Heiles Hamiltonian can be written as a two-dimensional Schrödinger equation.  The corresponding two-dimensional Schrödinger equation is given by       i  ℏ   ∂   ∂  t    Ψ   (  x  ,  y  )    =    [      -   ℏ  2     2  m     ∇  2    +    1  2    (    x  2   +   y  2    )    +   λ   (     x  2   y   -    1  3    y  3     )     ]   Ψ   (  x  ,  y  )          i  Planck-constant-over-2-pi       t    normal-Ψ   x  y       delimited-[]           superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2      2  m     superscript  normal-∇  2        1  2      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2       λ       superscript  x  2   y       1  3    superscript  y  3        normal-Ψ   x  y      i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,y)=\left[\frac{-\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{%

Usually the wada property cannot be seen in the Hamiltonian system but Hénon-Heiles exit basin shows an interesting wada property. It can be seen that when the energy is greater than the critical energy, the Hénon-Heiles system has three exit basins. In 2001 M. A. F. Sanjuán et al. 3 had shown that in the Henon-Heiles system the exit basins have the wada property.
