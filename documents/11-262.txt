   Ag+-exporting ATPase      Ag+-exporting ATPase   In enzymology , an Ag+-exporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O + Ag + in   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + Ag + out   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , H 2 O , and Ag+ , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and Ag+ .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (Ag+-exporting) .  References      "  Category:EC 3.6.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
