   Class kappa-ell function      Class kappa-ell function   In control theory , it is often required to check if a nonautonomous system is stable or not. To cope with this it is necessary to use some special comparison functions . Class   𝒦   𝒦   \mathcal{K}   functions belong to this family:  Definition : A continuous function    β  :     [  0  ,  a  )   ×   [  0  ,  ∞  )    →   [  0  ,  ∞  )       normal-:  β   normal-→     0  a    0      0       \beta:[0,a)\times[0,\infty)\rightarrow[0,\infty)   is said to belong to class    𝒦  ℒ      𝒦  ℒ    \mathcal{KL}   if:   for each fixed   s   s   s   , the function    β   (  r  ,  s  )       β   r  s     \beta(r,s)   belongs to class kappa ;  for each fixed   r   r   r   , the function    β   (  r  ,  s  )       β   r  s     \beta(r,s)   is decreasing with respect to   s   s   s   and is s.t.     β   (  r  ,  s  )    →  0     normal-→    β   r  s    0    \beta(r,s)\rightarrow 0   for    s  →  ∞     normal-→  s     s\rightarrow\infty   .
