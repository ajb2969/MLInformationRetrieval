Class kappa-ell function




Class kappa-ell function

In control theory, it is often required to check if a nonautonomous system is stable or not. To cope with this it is necessary to use some special  comparison functions. Class 
 
 
 
  functions belong to this family:
Definition: A continuous function 
 
 
 
  is said to belong to class 
 
 
 
  if:

for each fixed 
 
 
 
 , the function 
 
 
 
  belongs to  class kappa;
for each fixed 
 
 
 
 , the function 
 
 
 
  is decreasing with respect to 
 
 
 
  and is s.t. 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
