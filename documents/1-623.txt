L'Hôpital's rule

 In mathematics, and more specifically in calculus, L'Hôpital's rule () uses derivatives to help evaluate limits involving indeterminate forms. Application (or repeated application) of the rule often converts an indeterminate form to an expression that can be evaluated by substitution, allowing easier evaluation of the limit. The rule is named after the 17th-century French mathematician Guillaume de l'Hôpital.
L'Hôpital's rule states that for functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  which are differentiable on an open interval 
 
 
 
  except possibly at a point 
 
 
 
 
  contained in 
 
 
 
 , if


 
 , and


 
    exists, and


 
  for all 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 ,
then


 
 .
The differentiation of the numerator and denominator often simplifies the quotient or converts it to a limit that can be evaluated directly.
History
Guillaume de l'Hôpital (also written l'Hospital1) published this rule in his 1696 book Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes (literal translation: Analysis of the Infinitely Small for the Understanding of Curved Lines), the first textbook on differential calculus.23 However, it is believed that the rule was discovered by the Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli.4
General form
The general form of L'Hôpital's rule covers many cases. Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  be extended real numbers (i.e., real numbers, positive infinity, or negative infinity). The real valued functions f and g are assumed to be differentiable on an open interval with endpoint c, and additionally 
 
 
 
  on the interval. It is also assumed that 
 
 
 
  Thus the rule applies to situations in which the ratio of the derivatives has a finite or infinite limit, and not to situations in which that ratio fluctuates permanently as x gets closer and closer to c.
If either



or



then



The limits may also be one-sided limits. In the second case, the hypothesis that f diverges to infinity is not used in the proof (see note at the end of the proof section); thus, while the conditions of the rule are normally stated as above, the second sufficient condition for the rule's procedure to be valid can be more briefly stated as 
 
 

The "
 
 
 
 " hypothesis appears most commonly in the literature. Some authors sidestep the hypothesis by adding other hypotheses elsewhere. One method used implicitly in  is to define the limit of a function with the additional requirement that the limiting function is defined everywhere on a connected interval with endpoint c.5 Another method appearing in  is to require that both f and g are differentiable everywhere on an interval containing c.
Requirement that the limit exists
The requirement that the limit



exist is essential. Without this condition, it may be the case that 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 
  exhibits undampened oscillations as x approaches c. If this happens, then L'Hôpital's rule does not apply. For example, if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then



this expression does not approach a limit, since the cosine function oscillates between 1 and −1. But working with the original functions, 
 
 
 
  can be shown to exist:


 
 .
Examples

Here is an example involving the sinc function, 
 
 
 
 , which handles the indeterminate form 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 :







\begin{align} \lim_{x \to 0} \operatorname{sinc}(x) & = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin\pi x}{\pi x} \\
                   \text{Letting } y & = \pi x \text{:} \\
\lim_{x \to 0} \operatorname{sinc}(x) & = \lim_{y \to 0} \frac{\sin y}{y} \\
                                     & = \lim_{y \to 0} \frac{\cos y}{1} \\
                                     & = 1.
\end{align} 

Alternatively, just observe that the limit is the definition of the derivative of the sine function at zero:
 







\begin{align} 1 & = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \sin x \; \text{ for } x = 0 \\
 & = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(x + h) - \sin(x)}{h} \\
 & = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(0 + h) - \sin(0)}{h} \\
 & = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(h)}{h} \\
 & = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin\pi x}{\pi x} = 1 \\
\end{align} 

This is a more elaborate example involving 
 
 
 
 . Applying L'Hôpital's rule a single time still results in an indeterminate form. In this case, the limit may be evaluated by applying the rule three times:







\begin{align} \lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{2\sin x-\sin 2x}{x-\sin x}} & =\lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{2\cos x -2\cos 2x}{1-\cos x}} \\ & = \lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{-2\sin x +4\sin 2x}{\sin x}} \\ & = \lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{-2\cos x +8\cos 2x}{\cos x}} \\ & ={\frac{-2 +8}{1}} \\ & =6. \end{align} 

This example involves 
 
 
 
 
 . Suppose that 
 
 
 
 . Then










Here is another example involving 
 
 
 
 :







=\lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{e^x-1}{2x}}
\lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{e^x}{2}}
{\frac{1}{2}}.

This example involves 
 
 
 
 . Assume 
 
 
 
 
  is a positive integer. Then







=\lim_{x\to\infty}{\frac{x^n}{e^x}}
\lim_{x\to\infty}{\frac{nx^{n-1}}{e^x}}
n\lim_{x\to\infty}{\frac{x^{n-1}}{e^x}}.

Repeatedly apply L'Hôpital's rule until the exponent is zero to conclude that the limit is zero.
 


Here is another example involving 
 
 
 
 :







=\lim_{x\to 0^+}{\frac{1/x}{-1/x^2}}
\lim_{x\to 0^+} -x
0.

Here is an example involving the impulse response of a raised-cosine filter and 
 
 
 
 :







\begin{align} \lim_{t\to 1/2} \operatorname{sinc}(t) \frac{\cos \pi t}{1 - (2t)^2} & = \operatorname{sinc}(1/2) \lim_{t\to 1/2} \frac{\cos \pi t}{1 - (2 t)^2} \\ & = \frac{2}{\pi} \lim_{t\to 1/2} \frac{-\pi \sin \pi t}{-8 t} \\ & = \frac{2}{\pi} \cdot \frac{\pi}{4} \\ & = \frac{1}{2}. \end{align} 

One can also use L'Hôpital's rule to prove the following theorem. If 
 
 
 
  is continuous at 
 
 
 
 , then







\begin{align} \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) + f(x - h) - 2f(x)}{h^2} & = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f'(x + h) - f'(x - h)}{2h} \\ & = f''(x). \end{align} 

Sometimes L'Hôpital's rule is invoked in a tricky way: suppose 
 
 
 
 
  converges as 
 
 
 
  and that 
 
 
 
  converges to positive or negative infinity. Then:








and so,  
 
 
 
   exists and  
 
 

The result remains true without the added hypothesis that 
 
 
 
  converges to positive or negative infinity, but the justification is then incomplete.
 


L'Hôpital's rule can be used to find the limiting form of a function. In the field of choice under uncertainty, the von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function










with 
 
 
 
 , defined over x>0, is said to have constant relative risk aversion equal to 
 
 
 
 . But unit relative risk aversion cannot be expressed directly with this expression, since as 
 
 
 
 
  approaches 1 the numerator and denominator both approach zero. However, a single application of L'Hôpital's rule allows this case to be expressed as
 









Complications
Sometimes L'Hôpital's rule does not lead to an answer in a finite number of steps unless a transformation of variables is applied. Examples include the following:

Two applications can lead to a return to the original expression that was to be evaluated:










This situation can be dealt with by substituting 
 
 
 
  and noting that y goes to infinity as x goes to infinity; with this substitution, this problem can be solved with a single application of the rule:
 










An arbitrarily large number of applications may never lead to an answer even without repeating:










This situation too can be dealt with by a transformation of variables, in this case 
 
 
 
 :
 









A common pitfall is using L'Hôpital's rule with some circular reasoning to compute a derivative via a difference quotient. For example, consider the task of proving the derivative formula for powers of x:



Applying L'Hôpital's rule and finding the derivatives with respect to h of the numerator and the denominator yields  as expected. However, differentiating the numerator required the use of the very fact that is being proven. This is an example of begging the question, since one may not assume the fact to be proven during the course of the proof.
Other indeterminate forms
Other indeterminate forms, such as , , , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 
 , can sometimes be evaluated using L'Hôpital's rule. For example, to evaluate a limit involving 
 
 
 
 , convert the difference of two functions to a quotient:



where L'Hôpital's rule was applied in going from (1) to (2) and then again in going from (3) to (4).
L'Hôpital's rule can be used on indeterminate forms involving exponents by using logarithms to "move the exponent down". Here is an example involving the indeterminate form :



It is valid to move the limit inside the exponential function because the exponential function is continuous. Now the exponent 
 
 
 
  has been "moved down". The limit  is of the indeterminate form 
 
 
 
 , but as shown in an example above, l'Hôpital's rule may be used to determine that



Thus



Other methods of evaluating limits
Although L'Hôpital's rule is a powerful way of evaluating otherwise hard-to-evaluate limits, it is not always the easiest way. Consider



This limit may be evaluated using L'Hôpital's rule:



It is valid to move the limit inside the cosine function because the cosine function is continuous.
But a simpler way to evaluate this limit is to use a substitution. 
 
 
 
 . As 
 
 
 
  approaches infinity, 
 
 
 
  approaches zero. So,



The final limit may be evaluated using L'Hôpital's rule or by noting that it is the definition of the derivative of the sine function at zero.
Still another way to evaluate this limit is to use a Taylor series expansion:



For 
 
 
 
 , the expression in parentheses is bounded, so the limit in the last line is zero.
Stolz–Cesàro theorem
The Stolz–Cesàro theorem is a similar result involving limits of sequences, but it uses finite difference operators rather than derivatives.
Geometric interpretation
Consider the curve in the plane whose 
 
 
 
 -coordinate is given by 
 
 
 
  and whose 
 
 
 
 -coordinate is given by 
 
 
 
 , with both functions continuous, i.e., the locus of points of the form



Suppose 
 
 
 
 . The limit of the ratio 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
  is the slope of the tangent to the curve at the point 
 
 
 
 . The tangent to the curve at the point 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 . L'Hôpital's rule then states that the slope of the tangent when 
 
 
 
  is the limit of the slope of the tangent to the curve as the curve approaches the origin, provided that this is defined.
Proof of L'Hôpital's rule
Special case
The proof of L'Hôpital's rule is simple in the case where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are continuously differentiable at the point 
 
 
 
  and where a finite limit is found after the first round of differentiation. It is not a proof of the general L'Hôpital's rule because it is stricter in its definition, requiring both differentiability and that c be a real number. Since many common functions have continuous derivatives (e.g. polynomials, sine and cosine, exponential functions), it is a special case worthy of attention.
Suppose that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are continuously differentiable at a real number 
 
 
 
 , that 
 
 
 
 , and that 
 
 
 
 . Then



This follows from the difference-quotient definition of the derivative. The last equality follows from the continuity of the derivatives at 
 
 
 
 . The limit in the conclusion is not indeterminate because 
 
 
 
 .
The proof of a more general version of L'Hôpital's rule is given below.
General proof
The following proof is due to , where a unified proof for the 0/0 and ±∞/±∞ indeterminate forms is given. Taylor notes that different proofs may be found in  and .
Let f and g be functions satisfying the hypotheses in the General form section. Let 
 
 
 
  be the open interval in the hypothesis with endpoint c. Considering that 
 
 
 
  on this interval and g is continuous, 
 
 
 
  can be chosen smaller so that g is nonzero on 
 
 
 
 .6
For each x in the interval, define 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
  ranges over all values between x and c. (The symbols inf and sup denote the infimum and supremum.)
From the differentiability of f and g on 
 
 
 
 , Cauchy's mean value theorem ensures that for any two distinct points x and y in 
 
 
 
  there exists a 
 
 
 
  between x and y such that 
 
 
 
 . Consequently 
 
 
 
  for all choices of distinct x and y in the interval. The value g(x)-g(y) is always nonzero for distinct x and y in the interval, for if it was not, the mean value theorem would imply the existence of a p between x and y such that ''g' (p'')=0.
The definition of m(x) and M(x) will result in an extended real number, and so it is possible for them to take on the values ±∞. In the following two cases, m(x) and M(x) will establish bounds on the ratio f/g.
Case 1:


For any x in the interval 
 
 
 
 , and point y between x and c,


 
  and therefore as y approaches c, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  become zero, and so


 
 .
Case 2:


For any x in the interval 
 
 
 
 , define 
 
 
 
 . For any point y between x and c, we have


 
 . As y approaches c, both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  become zero, and therefore


 
  The limit superior and limit inferior are necessary since the existence of the limit of f/g has not yet been established.
We need the facts that


 Note 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  exist as they are nondecreasing and nonincreasing functions of x, respectively.
Consider a sequence 
 
 
 
 , we easily have 
 
 
 
 , as the inequality holds for each i; this yields the inequalities 
 
 

We show 
 
 
 
 . Indeed, fix a sequence of numbers 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , and a sequence 
 
 
 
 . For each i, we may choose 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , by the definition of 
 
 
 
 . Thus we have 
 
 

 
  as desired.
The argument that 
 
 
 
  is similar.
 and


 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
In case 1, the Squeeze theorem, establishes that 
 
 
 
  exists and is equal to L. In the case 2, and the Squeeze theorem again asserts that 
 
 
 
 , and so the limit 
 
 
 
  exists and is equal to L. This is the result that was to be proven.
Note: In case 2 we did not use the assumption that f(x) diverges to infinity within the proof. This means that if |g(x)| diverges to infinity as x approaches c and both f and g satisfy the hypotheses of L'Hôpital's rule, then no additional assumption is needed about the limit of f(x): It could even be the case that the limit of f(x) does not exist. In this case, L'Hopital's theorem is actually a consequence of Cesàro–Stolz (see proof at http://www.imomath.com/index.php?options=686).
In the case when |g(x)| diverges to infinity as x approaches c and f(x) converges to a finite limit at c, then L'Hôpital's rule would be applicable, but not absolutely necessary, since basic limit calculus will show that the limit of f(x)/g(x) as x approaches c must be zero.
Corollary
A simple but very useful consequence of L'Hopital's rule is a well-known criterion for differentiability. It states the following: suppose that f is continuous at a, and that 
 
 
 
  exists for all x in some interval containing a, except perhaps for 
 
 
 
 . Suppose, moreover, that 
 
 
 
  exists. Then 
 
 
 
  also exists, and


 
 . In particular, f' is also continuous at a.
Proof
It suffices to consider the functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The continuity of f at a tells us that 
 
 
 
 ; obviously also 
 
 
 
 , since a polynomial function is always continuous everywhere. Applying L'Hopital's rule we conclude that 
 
 
 
 .

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the name was commonly spelled "l'Hospital", and he himself spelled his name that way. However, French spellings have been altered: the silent 's' has been removed and replaced with the circumflex over the preceding vowel. The former spelling is still used in English where there is no circumflex.↩

The functional analysis definition of the limit of a function does not require the existence of this connected interval.↩
Since ''g' '' is nonzero and g is continuous on the interval, it is impossible for g to be zero more than once on the interval. If it had two zeros, the mean value theorem would assert the existence of a point p in the interval between the zeros such that ''g' (p'')=0. So either g is already nonzero on the interval, or else the interval can be reduced in size so as not to contain the single zero of g.↩
