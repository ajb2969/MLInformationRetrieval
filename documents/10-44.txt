Flat manifold

In mathematics, a Riemannian manifold is said to be flat if its curvature is everywhere zero. Intuitively, a flat manifold is one that "locally looks like" Euclidean space in terms of distances and angles, e.g. the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180Â°.
The universal cover of a complete flat manifold is Euclidean space. This can be used to prove the theorem of  that all compact flat manifolds are finitely covered by tori; the 3-dimensional case was proved earlier by .
Examples
The following manifolds can be endowed with a flat metric. Note that this may not be their 'standard' metric (for example, the flat metric on the circle is not the metric induced by its embedding into 
 
 
 
 ).
Dimension 1

The line
The circle

Dimension 2

The plane
The cylinder
The Moebius band
The Klein bottle
The 2-dimensional torus. A flat torus can be isometrically embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space with a C1 map (by the Nash embedding theorem) but not with a C2 map, and the Clifford torus provides an isometric analytic embedding of a flat torus in four dimensions.

There are 17 compact 2-dimensional orbifolds with flat metric (including the torus and Klein bottle), listed in the article on orbifolds, that correspond to the 17 wallpaper groups.
Dimension 3
For the complete list of the 6 orientable and 4 non-orientable compact examples see Seifert fiber space.
