   Eckert number      Eckert number   The Eckert number ( Ec ) is a dimensionless number used in continuum mechanics . It expresses the relationship between a flow's kinetic energy and enthalpy , and is used to characterize dissipation . It is named after Ernst R. G. Eckert .  It is defined as      Ec  =    u  2     c  p   Δ  T        Ec     superscript  u  2      subscript  c  p   normal-Δ  T      \mathrm{Ec}=\frac{u^{2}}{c_{p}\Delta T}     where   u is the local flow velocity of the continuum,  c p is the constant-pressure local specific heat of the continuum,      Δ  T      normal-Δ  T    \Delta T   is the difference between wall temperature and local temperature.
