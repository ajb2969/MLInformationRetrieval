Eckert number

The Eckert number (Ec) is a dimensionless number used in continuum mechanics. It expresses the relationship between a flow's kinetic energy and enthalpy, and is used to characterize dissipation. It is named after Ernst R. G. Eckert.
It is defined as



where

u is the local flow velocity of the continuum,
cp is the constant-pressure local specific heat of the continuum,


 
  is the difference between wall temperature and local temperature.
