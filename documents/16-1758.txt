   Serre's theorem on affineness      Serre's theorem on affineness   In algebraic geometry , given an algebraic variety (or more generally scheme ) X , Serre's theorem on affineness , after Jean-Pierre Serre , states that if   (1) X is quasi-compact, and  (2) for every quasi-coherent ideal sheaf I of O X ,      H  1    (  X  ,  I  )    =  0         superscript  H  1    X  I    0    H^{1}(X,I)=0   ,   then X is affine .
