   Ehresmann connection      Ehresmann connection   In differential geometry , an Ehresmann connection (after the French mathematician Charles Ehresmann who first formalized this concept) is a version of the notion of a connection , which makes sense on any smooth fibre bundle . In particular, it does not rely on the possible vector bundle structure of the underlying fibre bundle, but nevertheless, linear connections may be viewed as a special case. Another important special case of Ehresmann connections are principal connections on principal bundles , which are required to be equivariant in the principal Lie group action.  Introduction  A covariant derivative in differential geometry is a linear differential operator which takes the directional derivative of a section of a vector bundle in a covariant manner. It also allows one to formulate a notion of a parallel section of a bundle in the direction of a vector: a section s is parallel along a vector X if ∇ X s = 0. So a covariant derivative provides at least two things: a differential operator, and a notion of what it means to be parallel in each direction. An Ehresmann connection drops the differential operator completely and defines a connection axiomatically in terms of the sections parallel in each direction . Specifically, an Ehresmann connection singles out a vector subspace of each tangent space to the total space of the fibre bundle, called the horizontal space . A section s is then horizontal (i.e., parallel) in the direction X if d s ( X ) lies in a horizontal space. Here we are regarding s as a function s : M → E from the base M to the fibre bundle E , so that d s : TM → s*TE is then the pushforward of tangent vectors. The horizontal spaces together form a vector subbundle of TE .  This has the immediate benefit of being definable on a much broader class of structures than mere vector bundles. In particular, it is well-defined on a general fibre bundle . Furthermore, many of the features of the covariant derivative still remain: parallel transport, curvature , and holonomy .  The missing ingredient of the connection, apart from linearity, is covariance . With the classical covariant derivatives, covariance is an a posteriori feature of the derivative. In their construction one specifies the transformation law of the Christoffel symbols – which is not covariant – and then general covariance of the derivative follows as a result. For an Ehresmann connection, it is possible to impose a generalized covariance principle from the beginning by introducing a Lie group acting on the fibres of the fibre bundle. The appropriate condition is to require that the horizontal spaces be, in a certain sense, equivariant with respect to the group action.  The final finishing touch for an Ehresmann connection is that it can be represented as a differential form , in much the same way as the case of a connection form . If the group acts on the fibres and the connection is equivariant, then the form will also be equivariant. Furthermore, the connection form allows for a definition of curvature as a curvature form as well.  Formal definition  Let π : E → M be a smooth fiber bundle . 1 Let V = ker (d π : TE → TM ) be the vertical bundle consisting of the vectors "tangent to the fibres" of E , i.e. the fibre of V at e ∈ E is V e = T e ( E π ( e ) ). This subbundle of TE is canonically defined while the being tangent to the base space M is not (of course, this dissymmetry comes from the very definition of a fibre bundle, which "only has one projection" π : E → M while a product E = M × F would have two)  Definition via horizontal subspaces  An Ehresmann connection on E is a smooth subbundle H of TE , called the horizontal bundle of the connection, which is complementary to V , in the sense that it defines a direct sum decomposition TE = H ⊕ V . In more detail, the horizontal bundle has the following properties.   For each point e ∈ E , H e is a vector subspace of the tangent space T e E to E at e , called the horizontal subspace of the connection at e .  H e depends smoothly on e .  For each e ∈ E , H e ∩ V e = {0}.  Any tangent vector in T e E (for any e ∈ E ) is the sum of a horizontal and vertical component, so that T e E = H e + V e .   In more sophisticated terms, such an assignment of horizontal spaces satisfying these properties corresponds precisely to a smooth section of the jet bundle  J 1 E → E .  Definition via a connection form  Equivalently, let v be the projection onto the vertical bundle V along H (so that H = ker v ). This is determined by the above direct sum decomposition of TE into horizontal and vertical parts and is sometimes called the connection form of the Ehresmann connection. Thus v is a vector bundle homomorphism from TE to itself with the following properties (of projections in general):   v 2 = v ;  v is the identity on V=Image (v) .   Conversely, if v is a vector bundle endomorphism of TE satisfying these two properties, then H = ker v is the horizontal subbundle of an Ehresmann connection.  Finally, note that v , being a linear mapping of each tangent space into itself, may also be regarded as a TE -valued 1-form on E . This will be a useful perspective in sections to come.  Parallel transport via horizontal lifts  An Ehresmann connection also prescribes a manner for lifting curves from the base manifold M into the total space of the fibre bundle E so that the tangents to the curve are horizontal. 2 These horizontal lifts are a direct analogue of parallel transport for other versions of the connection formalism.  Specifically, suppose that γ ( t ) is a smooth curve in M through the point x = γ (0). Let e ∈ E x be a point in the fibre over x . A lift of γ through e is a curve     γ  ~    (  t  )        normal-~  γ   t    \tilde{\gamma}(t)   in the total space E such that        γ  ~    (  0  )    =  e         normal-~  γ   0   e    \tilde{\gamma}(0)=e   , and      π   (    γ  ~    (  t  )    )    =   γ   (  t  )     .        π     normal-~  γ   t      γ  t     \pi(\tilde{\gamma}(t))=\gamma(t).   A lift is horizontal if, in addition, every tangent of the curve lies in the horizontal subbundle of TE :          γ  ~   ′    (  t  )    ∈   H    γ  ~    (  t  )      .         superscript   normal-~  γ   normal-′   t    subscript  H     normal-~  γ   t      \tilde{\gamma}^{\prime}(t)\in H_{\tilde{\gamma}(t)}.     It can be shown using the rank-nullity theorem applied to π and v that each vector X ∈ T x M has a unique horizontal lift to a vector     X  ~   ∈    T  e   E        normal-~  X      subscript  T  e   E     \tilde{X}\in T_{e}E   . In particular, the tangent field to γ generates a horizontal vector field in the total space of the pullback bundle  γ * E . By the Picard–Lindelöf theorem , this vector field is integrable . Thus, for any curve γ and point e over x = γ (0), there exists a unique horizontal lift of γ through e for small time t .  Note that, for general Ehresmann connections, the horizontal lift is path-dependent. When two smooth curves in M , coinciding at γ 1 (0) = γ 2 (0) = x 0 and also intersecting at another point x 1 ∈ M , are lifted horizontally to E through the same e ∈ π −1 ( x 0 ), they will generally pass through different points of π −1 ( x 1 ). This has important consequences for the differential geometry of fibre bundles: the space of sections of H is not a Lie subalgebra of the space of vector fields on E , because it is not (in general) closed under the Lie bracket of vector fields . This failure of closure under Lie bracket is measured by the curvature .  Properties  Curvature  Let v be an Ehresmann connection. Then the curvature of v is given by 3      R  =     1  2     [  v  ,  v  ]        R      1  2    v  v      R=\tfrac{1}{2}[v,v]   where [-,-] denotes the Frölicher-Nijenhuis bracket of v ∈ Ω 1 ( E , TE ) with itself. Thus R ∈ Ω 2 ( E , TE ) is the two-form on E with values in TE defined by       R   (  X  ,  Y  )    =   v   (   [    (   id  -  v   )   X   ,    (   id  -  v   )   Y   ]   )          R   X  Y      v       id  v   X       id  v   Y       R(X,Y)=v\left([(\mathrm{id}-v)X,(\mathrm{id}-v)Y]\right)   , or, in other terms,       R   (  X  ,  Y  )    =    [   X  H   ,   Y  H   ]   V         R   X  Y     subscript    subscript  X  H    subscript  Y  H    V     R\left(X,Y\right)=\left[X_{H},Y_{H}\right]_{V}   , where X = X H + X V denotes the direct sum decomposition into H and V components, respectively. From this last expression for the curvature, it is seen to vanish identically if, and only if, the horizontal subbundle is Frobenius integrable . Thus the curvature is the integrability condition for the horizontal subbundle to yield transverse sections of the fibre bundle E → M .  The curvature of an Ehresmann connection also satisfies a version of the Bianchi identity :       [  v  ,  R  ]   =  0       v  R   0    \left[v,R\right]=0   where again [-,-] is the Frölicher-Nijenhuis bracket of v ∈ Ω 1 ( E , TE ) and R ∈ Ω 2 ( E , TE ).  Completeness  An Ehresmann connection allows curves to have unique horizontal lifts locally . For a complete Ehresmann connection, a curve can be horizontally lifted over its entire domain.  Holonomy  Flatness of the connection corresponds locally to the Frobenius integrability of the horizontal spaces. At the other extreme, non-vanishing curvature implies the presence of holonomy of the connection. 4  Special cases  Principal bundles and principal connections  Suppose that E is a smooth principal G -bundle over M . Then an Ehresmann connection H on E is said to be a principal (Ehresmann) connection 5 if it is invariant with respect to the G action on E in the sense that       H   e  g    =   d    (   R  g   )   e    (   H  e   )         subscript  H    e  g      normal-d   subscript   subscript  R  g   e    subscript  H  e      H_{eg}=\mathrm{d}(R_{g})_{e}(H_{e})   for any e ∈ E and g ∈ G ; here    d    (   R  g   )   e       normal-d   subscript   subscript  R  g   e     \mathrm{d}(R_{g})_{e}   denotes the differential of the right action of g on E at e .  The one-parameter subgroups of G act vertically on E . The differential of this action allows one to identify the subspace    V  e     subscript  V  e    V_{e}   with the Lie algebra g of group G , say by map    ι  :    V  e   →  𝔤      normal-:  ι   normal-→   subscript  V  e   𝔤     \iota\colon V_{e}\to\mathfrak{g}   . The connection form v of the Ehresmann connection may then be viewed as a 1-form ω on E with values in g defined by ω ( X )= ι ( v ( X )).  Thus reinterpreted, the connection form ω satisfies the following two properties:   It transforms equivariantly under the G action      R  h  *   ω   =   Ad   (   h   -  1    )   ω          superscript   subscript  R  h     ω     Ad   superscript  h    1    ω     R_{h}^{*}\omega=\hbox{Ad}(h^{-1})\omega   for all h ∈ G , where R h * is the pullback under the right action and Ad is the adjoint representation of G on its Lie algebra.  It maps vertical vector fields to their associated elements of the Lie algebra: ω ( X )= ι ( X ) for all X ∈ V .   Conversely, it can be shown that such a g -valued 1-form on a principal bundle generates a horizontal distribution satisfying the aforementioned properties.  Given a local trivialization one can reduce ω to the horizontal vector fields (in this trivialization). It defines a 1-form ''ω' '' on B via pullback . The form ω ' determines ω completely, but it depends on the choice of trivialization. (This form is often also called a connection form and denoted simply by ω .)  Vector bundles and covariant derivatives  Suppose that E is a smooth vector bundle over M . Then an Ehresmann connection H on E is said to be a linear (Ehresmann) connection if H e depends linearly on e ∈ E x for each x ∈ M . To make this precise, let S λ denote scalar multiplication by λ on E , and let    σ  :    E   ×  M   E   →  E      normal-:  σ   normal-→    subscript   M   E  E   E     \sigma:E\times_{M}E\to E   denote addition.  Then H is linear if and only if for all x ∈ M , the following properties are satisfied.        H   λ  e    =   d    (   S  λ   )   e    (   H  e   )         subscript  H    λ  e      normal-d   subscript   subscript  S  λ   e    subscript  H  e      H_{\lambda e}=\mathrm{d}(S_{\lambda})_{e}(H_{e})   for any e ∈ E and scalar λ.       d  σ   (   H  ⊠  H   )    =  H        d  σ   normal-⊠  H  H    H    d\sigma(H\boxtimes H)=H   where    H  ⊠  H     normal-⊠  H  H    H\boxtimes H   denotes the corresponding horizontal subbundle on    E   ×  M   E      subscript   M   E  E    E\times_{M}E   .   Since E is a vector bundle, its vertical bundle V is isomorphic to π * E . Therefore if s is a section of E , then v (d s ): TM → s * V = s * π * E = E . The fact that the Ehresmann connection is linear implies that this is a vector bundle homomorphism, and is therefore given by a section ∇ s of the vector bundle Hom( TM , E ), called the covariant derivative of s .  Conversely a covariant derivative  ∇ on a vector bundle defines a linear Ehresmann connection by defining H e , for e ∈ E with x = π ( e ), to be the image d s x ( T x M ) where s is a section of E with s(x) = e and ∇ X s''=0 for all X ∈ T x M .  Note that (for historical reasons) the term linear when applied to connections, is sometimes used (like the word affine – see Affine connection ) to refer to connections defined on the tangent bundle or frame bundle .  Associated bundles  An Ehresmann connection on a fibre bundle (endowed with a structure group) sometimes gives rise to an Ehresmann connection on an associated bundle . For instance, a (linear) connection in a vector bundle  E , thought of giving a parallelism of E as above, induces a connection on the associated bundle of frames P E of E . Conversely, a connection in P E gives rise to a (linear) connection in E provided that the connection in P E is equivariant with respect to the action of the general linear group on the frames (and thus a principal connection ). It is not always possible for an Ehresmann connection to induce, in a natural way, a connection on an associated bundle. For example, a non-equivariant Ehresmann connection on a bundle of frames of a vector bundle may not induce a connection on the vector bundle.  Suppose that E is an associated bundle of P , so that E = P × G  F . A G -connection on E is an Ehresmann connection such that the parallel transport map τ : F x → F x′ is given by a G -transformation of the fibres (over sufficiently nearby points x and x ′ in M joined by a curve). 6  Given a principal connection on P , one obtains a G -connection on the associated fibre bundle E = P × G  F via pullback .  Conversely, given a G -connection on E it is possible to recover the principal connection on the associated principal bundle P . To recover this principal connection, one introduces the notion of a frame on the typical fibre F . Since G is a finite-dimensional 7 Lie group acting effectively on F , there must exist a finite configuration of points ( y 1 ,..., y m ) within F such that the G -orbit R = {( gy 1 ,..., gy m ) | g ∈ G } is a principal homogeneous space of G . One can think of R as giving a generalization of the notion of a frame for the G -action on F . Note that, since R is a principal homogeneous space for G , the fibre bundle E ( R ) associated to E with typical fibre R is (equivalent to) the principal bundle associated to E . But it is also a subbundle of the m -fold product bundle of E with itself. The distribution of horizontal spaces on E induces a distribution of spaces on this product bundle. Since the parallel transport maps associated to the connection are G -maps, they preserve the subspace E ( R ), and so the G -connection descends to a principal G -connection on E ( R ).  In summary, there is a one-to-one correspondence (up to equivalence) between the descents of principal connections to associated fibre bundles, and G -connections on associated fibre bundles. For this reason, in the category of fibre bundles with a structure group G , the principal connection contains all relevant information for G -connections on the associated bundles. Hence, unless there is an overriding reason to consider connections on associated bundles (as there is, for instance, in the case of Cartan connections ) one usually works directly with the principal connection.
