Acceleration (differential geometry)

In mathematics and physics, acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of a curve with respect to a given linear connection. This operation provides us with a measure of the rate and direction of the "bend".12
Formal definition
Consider a differentiable manifold

 
  with a given connection 
 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be a curve in 
 
 
 
  with tangent vector, i.e. velocity, 
 
 
 
 .
The acceleration vector of 
 
 
 
  is defined by 
 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the covariant derivative associated to 
 
 
 
 .
It is a covariant derivative along 
 
 
 
 , and it is often denoted by



The concept of acceleration is a covariant derivative concept. In other words, in order to define acceleration an additional structure on 
 
 
 
 
  must be given.
