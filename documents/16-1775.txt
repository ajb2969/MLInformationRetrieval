   Acceleration (differential geometry)      Acceleration (differential geometry)   In mathematics and physics , acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of a curve with respect to a given linear connection . This operation provides us with a measure of the rate and direction of the "bend". 1 2  Formal definition  Consider a differentiable manifold    M   M   M   with a given connection   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   . Let    γ  :    \R   →  M      normal-:  γ   normal-→  \R  M     \gamma\colon\R\to M   be a curve in   M   M   M   with tangent vector , i.e. velocity,     γ  ˙    (  t  )        normal-˙  γ   t    {\dot{\gamma}}(t)   .  The acceleration vector of   γ   γ   \gamma   is defined by     ∇   γ  ˙     γ  ˙       subscript  normal-∇   normal-˙  γ     normal-˙  γ     \nabla_{\dot{\gamma}}{\dot{\gamma}}   , where   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   denotes the covariant derivative associated to   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   .  It is a covariant derivative along   γ   γ   \gamma   , and it is often denoted by         ∇   γ  ˙     γ  ˙    =    ∇   γ  ˙     d  t     .        subscript  normal-∇   normal-˙  γ     normal-˙  γ       normal-∇   normal-˙  γ      d  t      \nabla_{\dot{\gamma}}{\dot{\gamma}}=\frac{\nabla\dot{\gamma}}{dt}.     The concept of acceleration is a covariant derivative concept. In other words, in order to define acceleration an additional structure on   M   M   M   must be given.
