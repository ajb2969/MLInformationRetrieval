24-methylenesterol C-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a 24-methylenesterol C-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 24-methylenelophenol 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + (Z)-24-ethylidenelophenol
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 24-methylenelophenol, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and (Z)-24-ethylidenelophenol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:24-methylenelophenol C-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include SMT2, and 24-methylenelophenol C-241-methyltransferase. This enzyme participates in the biosynthesis of steroids.
