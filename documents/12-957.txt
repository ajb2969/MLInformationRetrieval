   Free loop      Free loop   In the mathematical field of topology , a free loop is a variant of the mathematical notion of a loop . Whereas a loop has a distinguished point on it, called a basepoint, a free loop lacks such a distinguished point. Formally, let   X   X   X   be a topological space . Then a free loop in   X   X   X   is an equivalence class of continuous functions from the circle     S  1     superscript  S  1    S^{1}   to   X   X   X   . Two loops are equivalent if they differ by a reparameterization of the circle. That is,    f  ∼  g     similar-to  f  g    f\sim g   if there exists a homeomorphism     ψ  :    S  1   →   S  1       normal-:  ψ   normal-→   superscript  S  1    superscript  S  1      \psi:S^{1}\rightarrow S^{1}   such that    g  =   f  ∘  ψ       g    f  ψ     g=f\circ\psi   .  Thus, a free loop, as opposed to a based loop used in the definition of the fundamental group , is a map from the circle to the space without the basepoint-preserving restriction. Free homotopy classes of free loops correspond to conjugacy classes in the fundamental group.  In the last years, interest in the space of all free loops    L  X      L  X    LX   has grown with the advent of string topology , i.e. the study of new algebraic structures on the homology of the free loop space.
