   Progesterone 11alpha-monooxygenase      Progesterone 11alpha-monooxygenase   In enzymology , a progesterone 11alpha-monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   progesterone + AH 2 + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   11alpha-hydroxyprogesterone + A + H 2 O   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are progesterone , AH2, and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 11alpha-hydroxyprogesterone , A, and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derive from O miscellaneous. The systematic name of this enzyme class is progesterone,hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (11alpha-hydroxylating) . This enzyme is also called progesterone 11alpha-hydroxylase . This enzyme participates in c21-steroid hormone metabolism .
