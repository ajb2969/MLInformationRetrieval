Jensen–Shannon divergence
In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], the '''[[Johan Jensen (mathematician)|Jensen]]–[[Claude Shannon|Shannon]] divergence''' is a popular method of measuring the similarity between two [[probability distribution]]s.  It is also known as '''information radius''' ('''IRad'''){{cite book |author=Hinrich Schütze; Christopher D.

The square root of the Jensen–Shannon divergence is a metric often referred to as Jensen-Shannon distance.12
Definition
Consider the set 
 
 
 
  of probability distributions where A is a set provided with some σ-algebra of measurable subsets. In particular we can take A to be a finite or countable set with all subsets being measurable.
The Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD) 
 
 
 
  is a symmetrized and smoothed version of the Kullback–Leibler divergence

 
 . It is defined by



where 
 
 

A more general definition, allowing for the comparison of more than two probability distributions, is:



where 
 
 
 
  are weights that are selected for the probability distributions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  is the Shannon entropy for distribution 
 
 
 
 . For the two-distribution case described above,



Bounds
The Jensen–Shannon divergence is bounded by 1, given that one uses the base 2 logarithm.3



For log base e, or ln, which is commonly used in statistical thermodynamics, the upper bound is ln(2):



Relation to mutual information
The Jensen–Shannon divergence is the mutual information between a random variable 
 
 
 
 
  associated to a mixture distribution between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and the binary indicator variable 
 
 
 
  that is used to switch between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  to produce the mixture. Let 
 
 
 
  be some abstract function on the underlying set of events that discriminates well between events, and choose the value of 
 
 
 
  according to 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  and according to 
 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 . That is, we are choosing 
 
 
 
  according to the probability measure 
 
 
 
 , and its distribution is the mixture distribution. We compute


 
 
  It follows from the above result that the Jensen–Shannon divergence is bounded by 0 and 1 because mutual information is non-negative and bounded by 
 
 
 
 . The JSD is not always bounded by 0 and 1: the upper limit of 1 arises here because we are considering the specific case involving the binary variable 
 
 
 
 .
One can apply the same principle to a joint distribution and the product of its two marginal distribution (in analogy to Kullback–Leibler divergence and mutual information) and to measure how reliably one can decide if a given response comes from the joint distribution or the product distribution—subject to the assumption that these are the only two possibilities.4
Quantum Jensen–Shannon divergence
The generalization of probability distributions on density matrices allows to define quantum Jensen–Shannon divergence (QJSD).56 It is defined for a set of density matrices

 
  and probability distribution 
 
 
 
  as



where 
 
 
 
  is the von Neumann entropy. This quantity was introduced in quantum information theory, where it is called the Holevo information: it gives the upper bound for amount of classical information encoded by the quantum states 
 
 
 
  under the prior distribution 
 
 
 
  (see Holevo's theorem)7 Quantum Jensen–Shannon divergence for 
 
 
 
  and two density matrices is a symmetric function, everywhere defined, bounded and equal to zero only if two density matrices are the same. It is a square of a metric for pure states8 but it is unknown whether the metric property holds in general.9 The Bures metric is closely related to the quantum JS divergence; it is the quantum analog of the Fisher information metric.
Applications
The Jensen–Shannon divergence has been applied in bioinformatics and genome comparison,1011 in protein surface comparison,12 in the social sciences,13 in the quantitative study of history,14 and in machine learning.15
