   Cohomological descent      Cohomological descent   In algebraic geometry, a cohomological descent is, roughly, a " derived " version of a fully faithful descent in the classical descent theory . This point is made precise by the below: the following are equivalent: 1 in an appropriate setting, given a map a from a simplicial space X to a space S ,        a  *   :     D  +    (  S  )    →    D  +    (  X  )        normal-:   superscript  a     normal-→     superscript  D    S      superscript  D    X      a^{*}:D^{+}(S)\to D^{+}(X)   is fully faithful.  The natural transformation     id    D  +    (  S  )     →    R   a  *    ∘   a  *       normal-→   subscript  id     superscript  D    S        R   subscript  a      superscript  a       \operatorname{id}_{D^{+}(S)}\to Ra_{*}\circ a^{*}   is an isomorphism.   The map a is then said to be a morphism of cohomological descent. 2  The treatment in SGA uses a lot of topos theory . Conrad's notes gives a more down-to-earth exposition.
