Igusa zeta-function

In mathematics, an Igusa zeta function is a type of generating function, counting the number of solutions of an equation, modulo p, p2, p3, and so on.
Definition
For a prime number p let K be a p-adic field, i.e. 
 
 
 
 , R the valuation ring and P the maximal ideal. For 
 
 

 
  denotes the valuation of z, 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  for a uniformizing parameter π of R.
Furthermore let 
 
 
 
  be a Schwartz–Bruhat function, i.e. a locally constant function with compact support and let 
 
 
 
  be a character of 
 
 
 
 .
In this situation one associates to a non-constant polynomial

 
  the Igusa zeta function



where 
 
 
 
  and dx is Haar measure so normalized that 
 
 
 
  has measure 1.
Igusa's theorem
showed that 
 
 
 
  is a rational function in 
 
 
 
 . The proof uses Heisuke Hironaka's theorem about the resolution of singularities. Later, an entirely different proof was given by Jan Denef using p-adic cell decomposition. Little is known, however, about explicit formulas. (There are some results about Igusa zeta functions of Fermat varieties.)
Congruences modulo powers of 
 
 

Henceforth we take 
 
 
 
  to be the characteristic function of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to be the trivial character. Let 
 
 
 
  denote the number of solutions of the congruence


 
 .
Then the Igusa zeta function



is closely related to the Poincaré series
