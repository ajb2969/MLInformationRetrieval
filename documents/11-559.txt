   Steroid-lactonase      Steroid-lactonase   In enzymology , a steroid-lactonase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   testololactone + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   testolate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are testololactone and H 2 O , whereas its product is testolate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is testololactone lactonohydrolase .
