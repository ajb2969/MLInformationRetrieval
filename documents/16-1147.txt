ABJM superconformal field theory

In theoretical physics, ABJM theory is a quantum field theory studied by Ofer Aharony, Oren Bergman, Daniel Jafferis, and Juan Maldacena. It provides a holographic dual to M-theory on 
 
 
 
 . The ABJM theory is also closely related to Chern-Simons theory, and it serves as a useful toy model for solving problems that arise in condensed matter physics.1
