   Mason–Stothers theorem      Mason–Stothers theorem   The Mason–Stothers theorem , or simply Mason's theorem , is a mathematical theorem about polynomials , analogous to the abc conjecture for integers. It is named after W. Wilson Stothers , who published it in 1981, 1 and R. C. Mason , who rediscovered it shortly thereafter. 2  The theorem states:   Let    a   (  t  )       a  t    a(t)   ,    b   (  t  )       b  t    b(t)   , and    c   (  t  )       c  t    c(t)   be relatively prime polynomials over a field such that     a  +  b   =  c        a  b   c    a+b=c   and such that not all of them have vanishing derivative. Then       max   {   deg   (  a  )    ,   deg   (  b  )    ,   deg   (  c  )    }    ≤    deg   (   rad   (   a  b  c   )    )    -  1    ,         degree  a    degree  b    degree  c       degree   rad    a  b  c     1     \max\{\deg(a),\deg(b),\deg(c)\}\leq\deg(\operatorname{rad}(abc))-1,      where    r  a  d   (  f  )       r  a  d  f    rad(f)   is the product of the distinct irreducible factors of f , so for algebraically closed fields it is the polynomial of minimum degree that has the same roots as   f   f   f   and    d  e  g   (   r  a  d   (  f  )    )       d  e  g    r  a  d  f     deg(rad(f))   gives the number of distinct roots of   f   f   f   . 3    Examples   Over fields of characteristic 0 the condition that a , b , c do not all have vanishing derivative is equivalent to the condition that they are not all constant. Over fields of characteristic    p  >  0      p  0    p>0   it is not enough to assume that they are not all constant. For example, the identity gives an example where the maximum degree of the three polynomials (   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   as the summands on the left hand side, and   c   c   c   as the right hand side) is   p   p   p   , but the degree of the radical is only   2   2   2   .    Taking a ( t )= t n and c ( t ) = ( t +1) n gives an example where equality holds in the Mason–Stothers theorem, showing that the inequality is in some sense the best possible.    A corollary of the Mason–Stothers theorem is the analog of Fermat's last theorem for function fields: if   a ( t ) n + b ( t ) n = c ( t ) n for a , b , c polynomials over a field of characteristic 0 and n >2 then either at least one of a , b , c is 0 or they are all constant.
