   Elastic instability      Elastic instability   (Figure)  Elastic instability of a rigid beam supported by an angular spring.   Elastic instability is a form of instability occurring in elastic systems, such as buckling of beams and plates subject to large compressive loads.  Single degree of freedom-systems  Consider as a simple example a rigid beam of length L , hinged in one end and free in the other, and having an angular spring attached to the hinged end. The beam is loaded in the free end by a force F acting in the compressive axial direction of the beam, see the figure to the right.  Moment equilibrium condition  Assuming a clockwise angular deflection   θ   θ   \theta   , the clockwise moment exerted by the force becomes     M  F   =   F  L   sin  θ         subscript  M  F     F  L    θ      M_{F}=FL\sin\theta   . The moment equilibrium equation is given by       F  L   sin  θ    =    k  θ   θ         F  L    θ       subscript  k  θ   θ     FL\sin\theta=k_{\theta}\theta     where    k  θ     subscript  k  θ    k_{\theta}   is the spring constant of the angular spring (Nm/radian). Assuming   θ   θ   \theta   is small enough, implementing the Taylor expansion of the sine function and keeping the two first terms yields       F  L   (   θ  -    1  6    θ  3     )    ≈    k  θ   θ         F  L    θ      1  6    superscript  θ  3         subscript  k  θ   θ     FL\Bigg(\theta-\frac{1}{6}\theta^{3}\Bigg)\approx k_{\theta}\theta     which has three solutions, the trivial    θ  =  0      θ  0    \theta=0   , and      θ  ≈   ±    6   (   1  -    k  θ    F  L     )          θ   plus-or-minus      6    1     subscript  k  θ     F  L          \theta\approx\pm\sqrt{6\Bigg(1-\frac{k_{\theta}}{FL}\Bigg)}     which is imaginary (i.e. not physical) for     F  L   <   k  θ         F  L    subscript  k  θ     FL   and real otherwise. This implies that for small compressive forces, the only equilibrium state is given by    θ  =  0      θ  0    \theta=0   , while if the force exceeds the value     k  θ   /  L       subscript  k  θ   L    k_{\theta}/L   there is suddenly another mode of deformation possible.  Energy method  The same result can be obtained by considering energy relations. The energy stored in the angular spring is       E  spring   =   ∫    k  θ   θ  d  θ    =    1  2    k  θ    θ  2           subscript  E  spring        subscript  k  θ   θ  normal-d  θ             1  2    subscript  k  θ    superscript  θ  2       E_{\mathrm{spring}}=\int k_{\theta}\theta\mathrm{d}\theta=\frac{1}{2}k_{\theta%
 }\theta^{2}     and the work done by the force is simply the force multiplied by the vertical displacement of the beam end, which is    L   (   1  -   cos  θ    )       L    1    θ      L(1-\cos\theta)   . Thus,       E  force   =   ∫   F  d  x    =   F  L   (   1  -   cos  θ    )           subscript  E  force       F  normal-d  x           F  L    1    θ        E_{\mathrm{force}}=\int{F\mathrm{d}x=FL(1-\cos\theta)}     The energy equilibrium condition     E  spring   =   E  force        subscript  E  spring    subscript  E  force     E_{\mathrm{spring}}=E_{\mathrm{force}}   now yields    F  =    k  θ   /  L       F     subscript  k  θ   L     F=k_{\theta}/L   as before (besides from the trivial    θ  =  0      θ  0    \theta=0   ).  Stability of the solutions  Any solution   θ   θ   \theta   is stable  iff a small change in the deformation angle    Δ  θ      normal-Δ  θ    \Delta\theta   results in a reaction moment trying to restore the original angle of deformation. The net clockwise moment acting on the beam is       M   (  θ  )    =    F  L   sin  θ    -    k  θ   θ          M  θ       F  L    θ       subscript  k  θ   θ      M(\theta)=FL\sin\theta-k_{\theta}\theta     An infinitesimal clockwise change of the deformation angle   θ   θ   \theta   results in a moment       M   (   θ  +   Δ  θ    )    =   M  +   Δ  M    =    F  L   (    sin  θ   +   Δ  θ   cos  θ     )    -    k  θ    (   θ  +   Δ  θ    )             M    θ    normal-Δ  θ       M    normal-Δ  M             F  L      θ     normal-Δ  θ    θ         subscript  k  θ     θ    normal-Δ  θ         M(\theta+\Delta\theta)=M+\Delta M=FL(\sin\theta+\Delta\theta\cos\theta)-k_{%
 \theta}(\theta+\Delta\theta)     which can be rewritten as       Δ  M   =   Δ  θ   (    F  L   cos  θ    -   k  θ    )          normal-Δ  M     normal-Δ  θ      F  L    θ     subscript  k  θ       \Delta M=\Delta\theta(FL\cos\theta-k_{\theta})     since     F  L   sin  θ    =    k  θ   θ         F  L    θ       subscript  k  θ   θ     FL\sin\theta=k_{\theta}\theta   due to the moment equilibrium condition. Now, a solution   θ   θ   \theta   is stable iff a clockwise change     Δ  θ   >  0        normal-Δ  θ   0    \Delta\theta>0   results in a negative change of moment     Δ  M   <  0        normal-Δ  M   0    \Delta M<0   and vice versa. Thus, the condition for stability becomes        Δ  M    Δ  θ    =    d  M    d  θ    =    F  L   cos  θ    -   k  θ    <  0            normal-Δ  M     normal-Δ  θ        normal-d  M     normal-d  θ             F  L    θ     subscript  k  θ         0     \frac{\Delta M}{\Delta\theta}=\frac{\mathrm{d}M}{\mathrm{d}\theta}=FL\cos%
 \theta-k_{\theta}<0     The solution    θ  =  0      θ  0    \theta=0   is stable only for     F  L   <   k  θ         F  L    subscript  k  θ     FL   , which is expected. By expanding the cosine term in the equation, the approximate stability condition is obtained:       |  θ  |   >    2   (   1  -    k  θ    F  L     )           θ       2    1     subscript  k  θ     F  L         |\theta|>\sqrt{2\Bigg(1-\frac{k_{\theta}}{FL}\Bigg)}     for     F  L   >   k  θ         F  L    subscript  k  θ     FL>k_{\theta}   , which the two other solutions satisfy. Hence, these solutions are stable.  Multiple degrees of freedom-systems  (Figure)  Elastic instability, 2 degrees of freedom   By attaching another rigid beam to the original system by means of an angular spring a two degrees of freedom-system is obtained. Assume for simplicity that the beam lengths and angular springs are equal. The equilibrium conditions become       F  L   (    sin   θ  1    +   sin   θ  2     )    =    k  θ    θ  1          F  L       subscript  θ  1       subscript  θ  2         subscript  k  θ    subscript  θ  1      FL(\sin\theta_{1}+\sin\theta_{2})=k_{\theta}\theta_{1}        F  L   sin   θ  2     =    k  θ    (    θ  2   -   θ  1    )          F  L     subscript  θ  2        subscript  k  θ      subscript  θ  2    subscript  θ  1       FL\sin\theta_{2}=k_{\theta}(\theta_{2}-\theta_{1})     where    θ  1     subscript  θ  1    \theta_{1}   and    θ  2     subscript  θ  2    \theta_{2}   are the angles of the two beams. Linearizing by assuming these angles are small yields        (       F  L   -   k  θ       F  L        k  θ       F  L   -   k  θ       )    (      θ  1        θ  2      )    =   (     0          )               F  L    subscript  k  θ      F  L      subscript  k  θ       F  L    subscript  k  θ         subscript  θ  1      subscript  θ  2        0    absent      \begin{pmatrix}FL-k_{\theta}&FL\\
 k_{\theta}&FL-k_{\theta}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\theta_{1}\\
 \theta_{2}\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0\\
 \par
 \end{pmatrix}     The non-trivial solutions to the system is obtained by finding the roots of the determinant of the system matrix , i.e. for        F  L    k  θ    =   3  2   ∓    5   2   ≈   {     0.382      2.618         fragments      F  L    subscript  k  θ       3  2   minus-or-plus      5   2     fragments  normal-{    0.382    2.618       \frac{FL}{k_{\theta}}=\frac{3}{2}\mp\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}\approx\left\{\begin{%
 matrix}0.382\\
 2.618\end{matrix}\right.     Thus, for the two degrees of freedom-system there are two critical values for the applied force F . These correspond to two different modes of deformation which can be computed from the nullspace of the system matrix. Dividing the equations by    θ  1     subscript  θ  1    \theta_{1}   yields        θ  2    θ  1     |    θ  1   ≠  0    =    k  θ    F  L    -  1  ≈   {     1.618       for  F  L   /   k  θ    ≈  0.382        -  0.618        for  F  L   /   k  θ    ≈  2.618          fragments     subscript  θ  2    subscript  θ  1     subscript  normal-|     subscript  θ  1   0        subscript  k  θ     F  L     1    fragments  normal-{    1.618        for  F  L    subscript  k  θ    0.382       0.618         for  F  L    subscript  k  θ    2.618        \frac{\theta_{2}}{\theta_{1}}\Big|_{\theta_{1}\neq 0}=\frac{k_{\theta}}{FL}-1%
 \approx\left\{\begin{matrix}1.618&\text{for }FL/k_{\theta}\approx 0.382\\
 -0.618&\text{for }FL/k_{\theta}\approx 2.618\end{matrix}\right.     For the lower critical force the ratio is positive and the two beams deflect in the same direction while for the higher force they form a "banana" shape. These two states of deformation represent the buckling  mode shapes of the system.
