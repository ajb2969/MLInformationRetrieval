   Ambient ionization      Ambient ionization    Ambient ionization is a form of ionization in which ions are formed in an ion source outside the mass spectrometer without sample preparation or separation. 1 2 3 4 Ions can be formed by extraction into charged electrospray droplets, thermally desorbed and ionized by chemical ionization , or laser desorbed or ablated and post-ionized before they enter the mass spectrometer. 5  Solid-liquid extraction  (Figure)  300 px|Schematic of a DESI solid-liquid extraction ion source: primary charged droplets hit the sample surface and molecules are extracted into the liquid. Secondary charged droplets removed from the surface produce bare ions as the solvent evaporates.   Solid-liquid extraction based ambient ionization is based on the use of a charged spray, for example electrospray to create a liquid film on the sample surface. 6 7 Molecules on the surface are extracted into the solvent. The action of the primary droplets hitting the surface produces secondary droplets that are the source of ions for the mass spectrometer.  Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) is one of the original ambient ionization sources 8 and uses an electrospray source to create charged droplets that are directed at a solid sample. The charged droplets pick up the sample through interaction with the surface and then form highly charged ions that can be sampled into a mass spectrometer. 9  Desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization (DAPPI) is a solid-liquid extraction ambient ionization method that enables the direct analysis of samples deposited on surfaces by means of a jet of hot solvent vapour and ultraviolet light. The hot jet thermally desorbs the sample from a surface and the vaporized sample is ionized by a vacuum ultraviolet light and consequently sampled into a mass spectrometer. 10  Plasma-based techniques  (Figure)  400 px|A direct analysis in real time (DART) metastable ion source for plasma based ambient ionization.   Plasma-based ambient ionization is based on an electrical discharge in a flowing gas that produces metastable atoms and molecules and reactive ions. Heat is often used to assist in the desorption of volatile species from the sample. Ions are formed by chemical ionization in the gas phase.  One proposed mechanism involves Penning ionization of ambient water clusters in a helium discharge:        H   e  *    +   [     (    H  2   O   )   n   H   ]    →     [     (    H  2   O   )    n  -  1    H   ]   +   +   O   H  ∙    +   e  -       normal-→      H   superscript  e      delimited-[]     subscript     subscript  H  2   O   n   H        superscript   delimited-[]     subscript     subscript  H  2   O     n  1    H        O   superscript  H  normal-∙     superscript  e       He^{*}+\left[(H_{2}O\right)_{n}H]\to\left[(H_{2}O\right)_{n-1}H]^{+}+OH^{%
 \centerdot}+e^{-}   .  The protonated water clusters protonate the sample molecules via         [     (    H  2   O   )   n   H   ]   +   +  S   →    S   H  +    +   n   H  2   O       normal-→     superscript   delimited-[]     subscript     subscript  H  2   O   n   H      S       S   superscript  H       n   subscript  H  2   O      \left[(H_{2}O\right)_{n}H]^{+}+S\to SH^{+}+nH_{2}O   .  Direct analysis in real time (DART) is an atmospheric pressure  ion source that operates by exposing the sample to a gas stream (typically helium or nitrogen) that contains long-lived electronically or excited neutral atoms , vibronically excited molecules (or "metastables" ). Excited states are formed in a glow discharge in a chamber through which the gas flows. 11  Laser assisted  (Figure)  250 px||Ion source for ambient mass spectrometry employing a combination of laser desorption and electrospray. The sample target is on the left.   Laser-based ambient ionization is a two-step process in which a pulsed laser is used to desorb or ablate material from a sample and the plume of material interacts with an electrospray or plasma to create ions. Lasers with ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths and nanosecond to femtosecond pulse widths have been used. Although atmospheric pressure MALDI is performed under ambient conditions, 12 it is not generally considered to be an ambient mass spectrometry technique. 13 14  Laser ablation was first coupled with mass spectrometry in the 1980s for the analysis of metals using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS). 15 The laser ablates the sample material that is introduced into a ICP to create atomic ions.  Infrared laser desorption can be coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization using laser desorption atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (LD-APCI). 16 For ambient ionization with a spray, the sample material is deposited on a target near the spray. The laser desorbs or ablates material from the sample that is ejected from the surface and into the spray, which can be an APCI spray with a corona discharge or an electrospray. Ambient ionization by electrospray-assisted laser desorption/ionization (ELDI) can be accomplished with ultraviolet 17 and infrared lasers 18 to the desorb material into the electrospray plume. Similar approaches to laser desorption/ablation into an electrospray are matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (MALDESI), 19  laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI), 20 laser assisted desorption electrospray ionization (LADESI), 21 laser desorption electrospray ionization (LDESI), 22 23 laser ablation mass spectrometry (LAMS), 24 and laser desorption spray post-ionization (LDSPI). 25 The term laser electrospray mass spectrometry has been used to denote the use of a femtosecond laser for ablation. 26 27 Laser ablation into an electrospray produces highly charged ions that are similar to those observed in direct electrospray.  An alternative ionization approach following laser desorption is a plasma. UV laser ablation can be combined with a flowing afterglow plasma for mass spectrometry imaging of small molecules. 28 and IR desorption has been combined with a metastable ion source. 29  Two step non-laser  In two-step non-laser methods, the material removal from the sample and the ionization steps are separate.  Probe electrospray ionization (PESI) is a modified version of conventional electrospray ionization in which the capillary for sample solution transferring is replaced by a solid needle with a sharp tip. 30 Compared with conventional electrospray ionization, high salt tolerance, direct sampling, and low sample consumption are found with PESI. PESI is not a continuous process; the needle for sampling and spraying is driven up and down at a frequency of 3–5 Hz.
