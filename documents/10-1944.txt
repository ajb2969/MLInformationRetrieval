   Anthranilate synthase      Anthranilate synthase   In enzymology , an anthranilate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   chorismate + L-glutamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   anthranilate + pyruvate + L-glutamate 2   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are chorismate and L-glutamine , whereas its 3 products are anthranilate , pyruvate , and L-glutamate .  Function  Reaction  In enzymology , an anthranilate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   chorismate + L-glutamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   anthranilate + pyruvate + L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are chorismate and L-glutamine , whereas its 3 products are anthranilate , pyruvate , and L-glutamate .  Structure and assembly  The complex is made up of α and β subunits. Gel filtration experiments reveal that the complex occurs as an α2β2 tetramer under native conditions, and as an αβ dimer under high salt concentrations. 1 The αβ dimers interact through the α subunits to form the complex.  Homologs  Paralogs  Nomenclature  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , to be specific the oxo-acid-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is chorismate pyruvate-lyase (amino-accepting; anthranilate-forming) . Other names in common use include anthranilate synthetase , chorismate lyase , and chorismate pyruvate-lyase (amino-accepting) . This enzyme participates in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis and two-component system - general .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
