   Coherence condition      Coherence condition   In mathematics , and particularly category theory a coherence condition is a collection of conditions requiring that various compositions of elementary morphisms are equal. Typically the elementary morphisms are part of the data of the category.  An illustrative example: a monoidal category  Part of the data of a monoidal category is a chosen morphism    α   A  ,  B  ,  C      subscript  α   A  B  C     \alpha_{A,B,C}   , called the associator :       α   A  ,  B  ,  C    :     (   A  ⊗  B   )   ⊗  C   →   A  ⊗   (   B  ⊗  C   )        normal-:   subscript  α   A  B  C     normal-→   tensor-product   tensor-product  A  B   C    tensor-product  A   tensor-product  B  C       \alpha_{A,B,C}\colon(A\otimes B)\otimes C\rightarrow A\otimes(B\otimes C)     for each triple of objects    A  ,  B  ,  C     A  B  C    A,B,C   in the category. Using compositions of these    α   A  ,  B  ,  C      subscript  α   A  B  C     \alpha_{A,B,C}   , one can construct a morphism       (  ⋯   (   A  N   ⊗   A   N  -  1    )   ⊗   A   N  -  2    )   ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   A  1   )  →  (   A  N   ⊗   (   A   N  -  1    ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   (   A  2   ⊗   A  1   )   ⋯  )   .     fragments   fragments  normal-(  normal-⋯   fragments  normal-(   subscript  A  N   tensor-product   subscript  A    N  1    normal-)   tensor-product   subscript  A    N  2    normal-)   tensor-product  normal-⋯  tensor-product   subscript  A  1   normal-)  normal-→  normal-(   subscript  A  N   tensor-product   fragments  normal-(   subscript  A    N  1    tensor-product  normal-⋯  tensor-product   fragments  normal-(   subscript  A  2   tensor-product   subscript  A  1   normal-)   normal-⋯  normal-)   normal-.

 \rightarrow(A_{N}\otimes(A_{N-1}\otimes\cdots\otimes(A_{2}\otimes A_{1})\cdots).     Actually, there are many ways to construct such a morphism as a composition of various    α   A  ,  B  ,  C      subscript  α   A  B  C     \alpha_{A,B,C}   . One coherence condition that is typically imposed is that these compositions are all equal.  Typically one proves a coherence condition using a coherence theorem , which states that one only needs to check a few equalities of compositions in order to show that the rest also hold. In the above example, one only needs to check that, for all quadruples of objects    A  ,  B  ,  C  ,  D     A  B  C  D    A,B,C,D   , the following diagram commutes  Further examples  Two simple examples that illustrate the definition are as follows. Both are directly from the definition of a category.  Identity  Let  be a morphism of a category containing two objects A and B . Associated with these objects are the identity morphisms and . By composing these with f , we construct two morphisms:   , and  .   Both are morphisms between the same objects as f . We have, accordingly, the following coherence statement:   .   Associativity of composition  Let ,  and  be morphisms of a category containing objects A , B , C and D . By repeated composition, we can construct a morphism from A to D in two ways:   , and  .   We have now the following coherence statement:   .   In these two particular examples, the coherence statements are theorems for the case of an abstract category, since they follow directly from the axioms; in fact, they are axioms. For the case of a concrete mathematical structure, they can be viewed as conditions, namely as requirements for the mathematical structure under consideration to be a concrete category, requirements that such a structure may meet or fail to meet.
