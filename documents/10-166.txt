Yuri Valentinovich Nesterenko (; born December 5, 1946 in Kharkiv, USSR now Ukraine) is a Soviet and Russian mathematician who has written papers in algebraic independence theory and transcendental number theory.
In 1997 he was awarded the Ostrowski Prize for his proof that the numbers π and eπ are algebraically independent. In fact, he proved the stronger result:

the numbers π, eπ, and Γ(1/4) are algebraically independent over Q.
the numbers π, 
 
 
 
 , and Γ(1/3) are algebraically independent over Q.
for all positive integers n, the numbers π, 
 
 
 
  are algebraically independent over Q.

He is a professor at Moscow State University, where he completed the mechanical-mathematical program in 1969, then the doctorate program (Soviet habilitation) in 1973, became a professor of the Number Theory Department in 1992.
He studied under Andrei Borisovich Shidlovskii. Nesterenko's students have included Wadim Zudilin.
