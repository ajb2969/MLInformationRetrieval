Coherence theorem

In mathematics and particularly category theory, a coherence theorem is a tool for proving a coherence condition. Typically a coherence condition requires an infinite number of equalities among compositions of structure maps. A coherence theorem states that, in order to be assured that all these equalities hold, it suffices to check a small number of identities.
Examples
Consider the case of a monoidal category. Recall that part of the data of a monoidal category is an associator, which is a choice of morphism



for each triple of objects 
 
 
 
 . Mac Lane's coherence theorem states that, provided the following diagram commutes for all quadruples of objects 
 
 
 
 ,
Â 
any pair of morphisms from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  constructed as compositions of various 
 
 
 
  are equal.
