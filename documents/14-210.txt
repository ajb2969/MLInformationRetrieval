   Poincaré complex      Poincaré complex   In mathematics, and especially topology , a Poincaré complex (named after the mathematician Henri Poincaré ) is an abstraction of the singular chain complex of a closed , orientable  manifold .  The singular homology and cohomology groups of a closed, orientable manifold are related by Poincaré duality . Poincaré duality is an isomorphism between homology and cohomology groups . A chain complex is called a Poincaré complex if its homology groups and cohomology groups have the abstract properties of Poincaré duality. 1  A Poincaré space is a topological space whose singular chain complex is a Poincaré complex. These are used in surgery theory to analyze manifold algebraically.  Definition  Let } be a chain complex , and assume that the homology groups of C are finitely generated . Assume that there exists a map , called a chain-diagonal, with the property that ; where the map denotes the ring homomorphism known as the augmentation map . It is defined as follows: if then 2  Using the diagonal as defined above, we are able to form pairings, namely:       ρ  :        H  k    (  C  )    ⊗   H  n     (  C  )    →     H   n  -  k     (  C  )    ,  where      ρ   (   x  ⊗  y   )    =  x  ⌢  y     ,     normal-:  ρ   formulae-sequence   normal-→     tensor-product     superscript  H  k   C    subscript  H  n    C       subscript  H    n  k    C   where          ρ   tensor-product  x  y    x    normal-⌢    y       \rho:H^{k}(C)\otimes H_{n}(C)\to H_{n-k}(C),\ \text{where}\ \ \rho(x\otimes y)%
 =x\frown y,   where   ⌢   normal-⌢   \scriptstyle\frown   denotes the cap product . 3 A chain complex C is called geometric if a chain- homotopy exists between Δ and τΔ, where  is given by  A geometric chain complex is called an algebraic Poincaré complex , of dimension n , if there exists an infinite- ordered element of the n -dimensional homology group, say , such that the maps given by       (  ⌢  μ  )   :   H  k    (  C  )   →   H   n  -  k     (  C  )      fragments   fragments  normal-(  normal-⌢  μ  normal-)   normal-:   superscript  H  k    fragments  normal-(  C  normal-)   normal-→   subscript  H    n  k     fragments  normal-(  C  normal-)     (\frown\mu):H^{k}(C)\to H_{n-k}(C)   are group isomorphisms for all . These isomorphisms are the isomorphisms of Poincaré duality. 4 5  Example   The singular  chain complex of an orientable, closed manifold is an example of a Poincaré complex, 6   See also   Poincaré space   References    – especially Chapter 2   External links   Classifying Poincaré complexes via fundamental triples on the Manifold Atlas   "  Category:Algebraic topology  Category:Homology theory  Category:Duality theories     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
