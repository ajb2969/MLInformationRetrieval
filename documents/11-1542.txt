   N-acetylgalactosamine kinase      N-acetylgalactosamine kinase   In enzymology , a N-acetylgalactosamine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + N-acetyl-D-galactosamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine 1-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine , whereas its two products are ADP and N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine 1-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:N-acetyl-D-galactosamine 1-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include GALK2 , GK2 , GalNAc kinase , and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-1-phosphate kinase .  References       "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Enzymes of known structure
