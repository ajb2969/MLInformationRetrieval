CSS code

In quantum error correction, CSS codes, named after their inventors, Robert Calderbank, Peter Shor and Andrew Steane, are a special type of Stabilizer codes constructed from classical codes with some special properties.
Construction
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be two (classical) 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  codes such, that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  both have minimal distance

 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the code dual to 
 
 
 
 . Then define 
 
 
 
 , the CSS code of 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  as an 
 
 
 
  code, with 
 
 
 
  as follows:
Define for 
 
 

$\sum_{y \in C_2} {{|}} x + y \rangle$, where $+$ is bitwise addition modulo 2. Then $\text{CSS}(C_1,C_2)$ is defined as $\{ {{|}} x + C_2 \rangle \mid x \in C_1 \}$.
