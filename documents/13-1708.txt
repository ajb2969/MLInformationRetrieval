   Similarity solution      Similarity solution   In study of partial differential equations, particularly fluid dynamics , a similarity solution is a form of solution in which at least one co-ordinate lacks a distinguished origin; more physically, it describes a flow which 'looks the same' either at all times, or at all length scales. These include, for example, the Blasius boundary layer or the Sedov-Taylor shell . 1  Concept  A powerful tool in physics is the concept of dimensional analysis and scaling laws ; by looking at the physical effects present in a system we may estimate their size and hence which, for example, might be neglected. If we have catalogued these effects we will occasionally find that the system has not fixed a natural lengthscale (timescale), but that the solution depends on space (time). It is then necessary to construct a lengthscale (timescale) using space (time) and the other dimensional quantities present - such as the viscosity   ν   ν   \nu   . These constructs are not 'guessed' but are derived immediately from the scaling of the governing equations.  Example - The impulsively started plate  Consider a semi-infinite domain bounded by a rigid wall and filled with viscous fluid. 2 At time    t  =  0      t  0    t=0   the wall is made to move with constant speed   U   U   U   in a fixed direction (for definiteness, say the   x   x   x   direction and consider only the    x  -  y      x  y    x-y   plane). We can see that there is no distinguished length scale given in the problem, and we have the boundary conditions of no slip      u  =  U      u  U    u=U   on    y  =  0      y  0    y=0     and that the plate has no effect on the fluid at infinity      u  →  0     normal-→  u  0    u\rightarrow 0   as    y  →  ∞     normal-→  y     y\rightarrow\infty   .  Now, if we examine the Navier-Stokes equations      ρ   (     ∂   u  →     ∂  t     +   u  →   .  ∇   u  →   )   =  -  ∇  p  +  μ   ∇  2    u  →      fragments  ρ   fragments  normal-(       normal-→  u      t      normal-→  u   normal-.  normal-∇   normal-→  u   normal-)     normal-∇  p   μ   superscript  normal-∇  2    normal-→  u     \rho\left(\dfrac{\partial\vec{u}}{\partial t}+\vec{u}.\nabla\vec{u}\right)=-%
 \nabla p+\mu\nabla^{2}\vec{u}     we can observe that this flow will be rectilinear , with gradients in the   y   y   y   direction and flow in the   x   x   x   direction, and that the pressure term will have no tangential component so that       ∂  p    ∂  y     =  0          p     y    0    \dfrac{\partial p}{\partial y}=0   . The   x   x   x   component of the Navier-Stokes equations then becomes         ∂   u  →     ∂  t     =   ν    ∂  y  2    u  →              normal-→  u      t      ν    subscript   superscript   2   y    normal-→  u       \dfrac{\partial\vec{u}}{\partial t}=\nu\partial^{2}_{y}\vec{u}     and we may apply scaling arguments to show that       U  t   ∼   ν   U   y  2        similar-to    U  t     ν    U   superscript  y  2       \frac{U}{t}\sim\nu\frac{U}{y^{2}}     which gives us the scaling of the   y   y   y   co-ordinate as      y  ∼    (   ν  t   )    1  /  2       similar-to  y   superscript    ν  t     1  2      y\sim(\nu t)^{1/2}   .  This allows us to pose a self-similar ansatz such that, with   f   f   f   and   η   η   \eta   dimensionless,      u  =  U  f   (  η  ≡    y    (   ν  t   )    1  /  2      )      fragments  u   U  f   fragments  normal-(  η     y   superscript    ν  t     1  2     normal-)     u=Uf\left(\eta\equiv\dfrac{y}{(\nu t)^{1/2}}\right)     We have now extracted all of the relevant physics and need only solve the equations; for many cases this will need to be done numerically. This equation is       -    η   f  ′    /  2    =   f  ′′             η   superscript  f  normal-′    2     superscript  f  ′′     -\eta f^{\prime}/2=f^{\prime\prime}     with solution satisfying the boundary conditions that      f  =   1  -   e  r  f   (   η  /  2   )         f    1    e  r  f    η  2       f=1-erf(\eta/2)   or    u  =   U   (   1  -   e  r  f   (   -   y  /    (   4  ν  t   )    1  /  2      )     )        u    U    1    e  r  f      y   superscript    4  ν  t     1  2           u=U\left(1-erf\left(-y/(4\nu t)^{1/2}\right)\right)     which is a self-similar solution of the first kind.
