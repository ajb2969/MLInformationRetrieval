   Polyvinyl-alcohol oxidase      Polyvinyl-alcohol oxidase   In enzymology , a polyvinyl-alcohol oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   polyvinyl alcohol + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxidized polyvinyl alcohol + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are polyvinyl alcohol and O 2 , whereas its two products are oxidized polyvinyl alcohol and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is polyvinyl-alcohol:oxygen oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include dehydrogenase, polyvinyl alcohol , and PVA oxidase .
