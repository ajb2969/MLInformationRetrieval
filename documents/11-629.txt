   N-methyl nucleosidase      N-methyl nucleosidase   In enzymology , a N-methyl nucleosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   7-methylxanthosine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   7-methylxanthine + D-ribose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 7-methylxanthosine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 7-methylxanthine and D-ribose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosylases that hydrolyse N-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 7-methylxanthosine ribohydrolase . Other names in common use include 7-methylxanthosine nucleosidase , N-MeNase , N-methyl nucleoside hydrolase , and methylpurine nucleosidase .
