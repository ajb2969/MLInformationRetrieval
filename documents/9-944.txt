   Power sum symmetric polynomial      Power sum symmetric polynomial   In mathematics , specifically in commutative algebra , the power sum symmetric polynomials are a type of basic building block for symmetric polynomials , in the sense that every symmetric polynomial with rational coefficients can be expressed as a sum and difference of products of power sum symmetric polynomials with rational coefficients. However, not every symmetric polynomial with integral coefficients is generated by integral combinations of products of power-sum polynomials: they are a generating set over the rationals, but not over the integers.  Definition  The power sum symmetric polynomial of degree k in   n   n   n   variables x 1 , ..., x n , written p k for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., is the sum of all k th powers of the variables. Formally,         p  k    (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =    ∑   i  =  1   n     x  i  k      .         subscript  p  k     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n       superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript   subscript  x  i   k      p_{k}(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{k}\,.   The first few of these polynomials are         p  0    (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =  n   ,         subscript  p  0     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n     n    p_{0}(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n})=n,            p  1    (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =    x  1   +   x  2   +  ⋯  +    x  n      ,         subscript  p  1     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n        subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-⋯   subscript  x  n      p_{1}(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n})=x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}\,,            p  2    (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =    x  1  2   +   x  2  2   +  ⋯  +    x  n  2      ,         subscript  p  2     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n        superscript   subscript  x  1   2    superscript   subscript  x  2   2   normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  x  n   2      p_{2}(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n})=x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\cdots+x_{n}^{2}\,,            p  3    (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =    x  1  3   +   x  2  3   +  ⋯  +    x  n  3      .         subscript  p  3     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n        superscript   subscript  x  1   3    superscript   subscript  x  2   3   normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  x  n   3      p_{3}(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n})=x_{1}^{3}+x_{2}^{3}+\cdots+x_{n}^{3}\,.   Thus, for each nonnegative integer   k   k   k   , there exists exactly one power sum symmetric polynomial of degree   k   k   k   in   n   n   n   variables.  The polynomial ring formed by taking all integral linear combinations of products of the power sum symmetric polynomials is a commutative ring .  Examples  The following lists the   n   n   n   power sum symmetric polynomials of positive degrees up to n for the first three positive values of    n  .    n   n.   In every case,     p  0   =  n       subscript  p  0   n    p_{0}=n   is one of the polynomials. The list goes up to degree n because the power sum symmetric polynomials of degrees 1 to n are basic in the sense of the Main Theorem stated below.  For n = 1:        p  1   =    x  1     .       subscript  p  1    subscript  x  1     p_{1}=x_{1}\,.     For n = 2:        p  1   =    x  1   +    x  2      ,       subscript  p  1      subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2      p_{1}=x_{1}+x_{2}\,,           p  2   =    x  1  2   +    x  2  2      .       subscript  p  2      superscript   subscript  x  1   2    superscript   subscript  x  2   2      p_{2}=x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}\,.     For n = 3:        p  1   =    x  1   +   x  2   +    x  3      ,       subscript  p  1      subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3      p_{1}=x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}\,,           p  2   =    x  1  2   +   x  2  2   +    x  3  2      ,       subscript  p  2      superscript   subscript  x  1   2    superscript   subscript  x  2   2    superscript   subscript  x  3   2      p_{2}=x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}\,,           p  3   =    x  1  3   +   x  2  3   +    x  3  3      ,       subscript  p  3      superscript   subscript  x  1   3    superscript   subscript  x  2   3    superscript   subscript  x  3   3      p_{3}=x_{1}^{3}+x_{2}^{3}+x_{3}^{3}\,,     Properties  The set of power sum symmetric polynomials of degrees 1, 2, ..., n in n variables generates the ring of symmetric polynomials in n variables. More specifically:   Theorem . The ring of symmetric polynomials with rational coefficients equals the rational polynomial ring     ℚ   [   p  1   ,  …  ,   p  n   ]    .      ℚ    subscript  p  1   normal-…   subscript  p  n      \mathbb{Q}[p_{1},\ldots,p_{n}].   The same is true if the coefficients are taken in any field whose characteristic is 0.   However, this is not true if the coefficients must be integers. For example, for n = 2, the symmetric polynomial       P   (   x  1   ,   x  2   )    =     x  1  2    x  2    +    x  1    x  2  2    +    x  1    x  2           P    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2          superscript   subscript  x  1   2    subscript  x  2       subscript  x  1    superscript   subscript  x  2   2       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2       P(x_{1},x_{2})=x_{1}^{2}x_{2}+x_{1}x_{2}^{2}+x_{1}x_{2}   has the expression        P   (   x  1   ,   x  2   )    =      p  1  3   -    p  1    p  2     2   +      p  1  2   -   p  2    2      ,        P    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2            superscript   subscript  p  1   3      subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2     2        superscript   subscript  p  1   2    subscript  p  2    2      P(x_{1},x_{2})=\frac{p_{1}^{3}-p_{1}p_{2}}{2}+\frac{p_{1}^{2}-p_{2}}{2}\,,   which involves fractions. According to the theorem this is the only way to represent    P   (   x  1   ,   x  2   )       P    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2      P(x_{1},x_{2})   in terms of p 1 and p 2 . Therefore, P does not belong to the integral polynomial ring     ℤ   [   p  1   ,  …  ,   p  n   ]    .      ℤ    subscript  p  1   normal-…   subscript  p  n      \mathbb{Z}[p_{1},\ldots,p_{n}].   For another example, the elementary symmetric polynomials  e k , expressed as polynomials in the power sum polynomials, do not all have integral coefficients. For instance,        p  n   =    ∑   j  =  1   n      (   -  1   )    j  -  1     e  j     p   n  -  j        .       subscript  p  n     superscript   subscript     j  1    n      superscript    1     j  1     subscript  e  j    subscript  p    n  j        p_{n}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}(-1)^{j-1}e_{j}p_{n-j}\,.   , so p 1 and p 2 cannot generate e 2 = x 1 x 2 .  Sketch of a partial proof of the theorem : By Newton's identities the power sums are functions of the elementary symmetric polynomials; this is implied by the following recurrence relation , though the explicit function that gives the power sums in terms of the e j is complicated (see Newton's identities ):        e  n   =    1  n     ∑   j  =  1   n      (   -  1   )    j  -  1     e   n  -  j      p  j        .       subscript  e  n       1  n     superscript   subscript     j  1    n      superscript    1     j  1     subscript  e    n  j     subscript  p  j        e_{n}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}(-1)^{j-1}e_{n-j}p_{j}\,.     Rewriting the same recurrence, one has the elementary symmetric polynomials in terms of the power sums (also implicitly, the explicit formula being complicated):      f   (   p  1   ,  …  ,   p  n   )       f    subscript  p  1   normal-…   subscript  p  n      f(p_{1},\ldots,p_{n})     This implies that the elementary polynomials are rational, though not integral, linear combinations of the power sum polynomials of degrees 1, ..., n . Since the elementary symmetric polynomials are an algebraic basis for all symmetric polynomials with coefficients in a field, it follows that every symmetric polynomial in n variables is a polynomial function     ℚ   [   p  1   ,  …  ,   p  n   ]    .      ℚ    subscript  p  1   normal-…   subscript  p  n      \mathbb{Q}[p_{1},\ldots,p_{n}].   of the power sum symmetric polynomials p 1 , ..., p n . That is, the ring of symmetric polynomials is contained in the ring generated by the power sums, $\mathbb Q[p_1,\ldots,p_n].$ Because every power sum polynomial is symmetric, the two rings are equal.  (This does not show how to prove the polynomial f is unique.)  For another system of symmetric polynomials with similar properties see complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials .
