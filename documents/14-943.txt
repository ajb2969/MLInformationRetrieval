Timeline

3rd millennium BCE Sexagesimal system of the Sumerians:
2nd millennium BCE Babylonian Pythagorean triples. According to mathematician S. G. Dani, the Babylonian cuneiform tablet Plimpton 322 written ca. 1850 BCE1 "contains fifteen Pythagorean triples with quite large entries, including (13500, 12709, 18541) which is a primitive triple,2 indicating, in particular, that there was sophisticated understanding on the topic" in Mesopotamia.
1st millennium BCE Baudhayana Śulba Sūtras Earliest statement of Pythagorean Theorem: According to , the Śulba Sūtras contain "the earliest extant verbal expression of the Pythagorean Theorem in the world, although it had already been known to the Old Babylonians."
 
The diagonal rope () of an oblong (rectangle) produces both which the flank (pārśvamāni) and the horizontal ()  produce separately."3

Since the statement is a sūtra, it is necessarily compressed and what the ropes produce is not elaborated on, but the context clearly implies the square areas constructed on their lengths, and would have been explained so by the teacher to the student.4

Mathematics Department, University of British Columbia, The Babylonian tablet Plimpton 322.↩
Three positive integers 
 
 
 
  form a primitive Pythagorean triple if 
 
 
 
  and if the highest common factor of 
 
 
 
  is 1. In the particular Plimpton322 example, this means that 
 
 
 
  and that the three numbers do not have any common factors. However some scholars have disputed the Pythagorean interpretation of this tablet; see Plimpton 322 for details.↩
