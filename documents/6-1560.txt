   Markov number      Markov number   A Markov number or Markoff number is a positive integer x , y or z that is part of a solution to the Markov Diophantine equation         x  2   +   y  2   +   z  2    =   3  x  y  z    ,         superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    superscript  z  2      3  x  y  z     x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=3xyz,\,     studied by .  The first few Markov numbers are   1 , 2 , 5 , 13 , 29 , 34 , 89 , 169 , 194 , 233 , 433, 610, 985, 1325, ...   appearing as coordinates of the Markov triples   (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 5), (1, 5, 13), (2, 5, 29), (1, 13, 34), (1, 34, 89), (2, 29, 169), (5, 13, 194), (1, 89, 233), (5, 29, 433), (1, 233, 610), (89, 233, 62210), etc.   There are infinitely many Markov numbers and Markov triples.  Markov tree  There are two simple ways to obtain a new Markov triple from an old one ( x , y , z ). First, one may permute the 3 numbers x , y , z , so in particular one can normalize the triples so that x ≤ y ≤ z . Second, if ( x , y , z ) is a Markov triple then by Vieta jumping so is ( x , y , 3 xy − z ). Applying this operation twice returns the same triple one started with. Joining each normalized Markov triple to the 1, 2, or 3 normalized triples one can obtain from this gives a graph starting from (1,1,1) as in the diagram. This graph is connected; in other words every Markov triple can be connected to (1,1,1) by a sequence of these operations. 1 If we start, as an example, with (1, 5, 13) we get its three neighbors (5, 13, 194), (1, 13, 34) and (1, 2, 5) in the Markov tree if x is set to 1, 5 and 13, respectively. For instance, starting with (1, 1, 2) and trading y and z before each iteration of the transform lists Markov triples with Fibonacci numbers. Starting with that same triplet and trading x and z before each iteration gives the triples with Pell numbers.  All the Markov numbers on the regions adjacent to 2's region are odd-indexed Pell numbers (or numbers n such that 2 n 2 − 1 is a square, ), and all the Markov numbers on the regions adjacent to 1's region are odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers (). Thus, there are infinitely many Markov triples of the form       (  1  ,   F    2  n   -  1    ,   F    2  n   +  1    )   ,     1   subscript  F      2  n   1     subscript  F      2  n   1      (1,F_{2n-1},F_{2n+1}),\,     where F x is the x th Fibonacci number. Likewise, there are infinitely many Markov triples of the form       (  2  ,   P    2  n   -  1    ,   P    2  n   +  1    )   ,     2   subscript  P      2  n   1     subscript  P      2  n   1      (2,P_{2n-1},P_{2n+1}),\,     where P x is the x th Pell number . 2  Other properties  Aside from the two smallest singular triples (1,1,1) and (1,1,2), every Markov triple consists of three distinct integers. 3  The unicity conjecture states that for a given Markov number c , there is exactly one normalized solution having c as its largest element: proofs of this conjecture have been claimed but none seems to be correct. 4  Odd Markov numbers are 1 more than multiples of 4, while even Markov numbers are 2 more than multiples of 32. 5  In his 1982 paper, Don Zagier conjectured that the n th Markov number is asymptotically given by         m  n   =     1  3     e    C   n    +   o   (  1  )          with  C   =   2.3523418721  …     .     formulae-sequence     subscript  m  n       1  3    superscript  e      C    n      o  1           with  C     2.3523418721  normal-…      m_{n}=\tfrac{1}{3}e^{C\sqrt{n}+o(1)}\quad\text{with }C=2.3523418721\ldots.   Moreover, he pointed out that      x  2   +   y  2   +   z  2    =    3  x  y  z   +   4  /  9           superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    superscript  z  2        3  x  y  z     4  9      x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=3xyz+4/9   , an extremely good approximation of the original Diophantine equation, is equivalent to      f   (  x  )    +   f   (  y  )     =   f   (  z  )            f  x     f  y      f  z     f(x)+f(y)=f(z)   with f ( t ) = arcosh (3 t /2). 6 The conjecture was proved by Greg McShane and Igor Rivin in 1995 using techniques from hyperbolic geometry. 7  The n th Lagrange number can be calculated from the n th Markov number with the formula        L  n   =    9  -   4   m  n    2       .       subscript  L  n       9    4   superscript   subscript  m  n   2        L_{n}=\sqrt{9-{4\over{m_{n}}^{2}}}.\,     The Markov numbers are sums of (non-unique) pairs of squares.  Markov's theorem  showed that if       f   (  x  ,  y  )    =    a   x  2    +   b  x  y   +   c    y  2            f   x  y        a   superscript  x  2      b  x  y     c   superscript  y  2       f(x,y)=ax^{2}+bxy+cy^{2}\,     is an indefinite binary quadratic form with real coefficients and discriminant     D  =    b  2   -   4  a  c        D     superscript  b  2     4  a  c      D=b^{2}-4ac   , then there are integers x , y for which f takes a nonzero value of absolute value at most       D   3        D   3    \frac{\sqrt{D}}{3}     unless f is a Markov form : 8 a constant times a form       p   x  2    +    (    3  p   -   2  a    )   x  y   +    (   b  -   3  a    )     y  2           p   superscript  x  2          3  p     2  a    x  y       b    3  a     superscript  y  2      px^{2}+(3p-2a)xy+(b-3a)y^{2}\,     where ( p , q , r ) is a Markov triple and  $$0 ==Matrices==
