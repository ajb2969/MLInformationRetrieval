Markov number

 A Markov number or Markoff number is a positive integer x, y or z that is part of a solution to the Markov Diophantine equation



studied by .
The first few Markov numbers are

1, 2, 5, 13, 29, 34, 89, 169, 194, 233, 433, 610, 985, 1325, ... 
 

appearing as coordinates of the Markov triples

(1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 5), (1, 5, 13), (2, 5, 29), (1, 13, 34), (1, 34, 89), (2, 29, 169), (5, 13, 194), (1, 89, 233), (5, 29, 433), (1, 233, 610), (89, 233, 62210), etc.
 

There are infinitely many Markov numbers and Markov triples.
Markov tree
There are two simple ways to obtain a new Markov triple from an old one (x, y, z). First, one may permute the 3 numbers x,y,z, so in particular one can normalize the triples so that x ≤ y ≤ z. Second, if (x, y, z) is a Markov triple then by Vieta jumping so is (x, y, 3xy − z). Applying this operation twice returns the same triple one started with. Joining each normalized Markov triple to the 1, 2, or 3 normalized triples one can obtain from this gives a graph starting from (1,1,1) as in the diagram. This graph is connected; in other words every Markov triple can be connected to (1,1,1) by a sequence of these operations.1 If we start, as an example, with (1, 5, 13) we get its three neighbors (5, 13, 194), (1, 13, 34) and (1, 2, 5) in the Markov tree if x is set to 1, 5 and 13, respectively. For instance, starting with (1, 1, 2) and trading y and z before each iteration of the transform lists Markov triples with Fibonacci numbers. Starting with that same triplet and trading x and z before each iteration gives the triples with Pell numbers.
All the Markov numbers on the regions adjacent to 2's region are odd-indexed Pell numbers (or numbers n such that 2n2 − 1 is a square, ), and all the Markov numbers on the regions adjacent to 1's region are odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers (). Thus, there are infinitely many Markov triples of the form



where Fx is the xth Fibonacci number. Likewise, there are infinitely many Markov triples of the form



where Px is the xth Pell number.2
Other properties
Aside from the two smallest singular triples (1,1,1) and (1,1,2), every Markov triple consists of three distinct integers.3
The unicity conjecture states that for a given Markov number c, there is exactly one normalized solution having c as its largest element: proofs of this conjecture have been claimed but none seems to be correct.4
Odd Markov numbers are 1 more than multiples of 4, while even Markov numbers are 2 more than multiples of 32.5
In his 1982 paper, Don Zagier conjectured that the nth Markov number is asymptotically given by


 
  Moreover, he pointed out that 
 
 
 
 , an extremely good approximation of the original Diophantine equation, is equivalent to 
 
 
 
  with f(t) = arcosh(3t/2).6 The conjecture was proved by Greg McShane and Igor Rivin in 1995 using techniques from hyperbolic geometry.7
The nth Lagrange number can be calculated from the nth Markov number with the formula



The Markov numbers are sums of (non-unique) pairs of squares.
Markov's theorem
showed that if



is an indefinite binary quadratic form with real coefficients and discriminant

 
 
 , then there are integers x, y for which f takes a nonzero value of absolute value at most



unless f is a Markov form:8 a constant times a form

 If ''X'' and ''Y'' are in ''[[Special linear group|SL]]''2('''[[Complex numbers|C]]''') then
 :[[Matrix (mathematics)#Trace|''Tr'']](''X'')''Tr''(''Y'')''Tr''(''X[[Matrix (mathematics)#Matrix multiplication|⋅]]Y'') + ''Tr''(''X''⋅''Y''⋅''X''[[Matrix (mathematics)#Invertible matrix and its inverse|−1]]⋅''Y''−1)+2= ''Tr''(''X'')2+''Tr''(''Y'')2+''Tr''(''X''⋅''Y'')2
 so that if Tr(''X''⋅''Y''⋅''X''−1⋅''Y''−1)=−2 then
 :''Tr''(''X'')''Tr''(''Y'')''Tr''(''X''⋅''Y'') = ''Tr''(''X'')2+''Tr''(''Y'')2+''Tr''(''X''⋅''Y'')2
 In particular if ''X'' and ''Y'' also  have integer entries then Tr(''X'')/3, Tr(''Y'')/3, and Tr(''X''⋅''Y'')/3 are a Markov triple. If ''X''⋅''Y''⋅''Z'' = [[Matrix (mathematics)#Identity matrix|1]] then Tr(''X''⋅''Y'') = Tr(''Z''), so more symmetrically if ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' are in SL2('''Z''') with ''X''⋅''Y''⋅''Z'' = 1 and the [[Commutator#Group theory|commutator]] of two of them has [[Matrix (mathematics)#Trace|trace]] −2, then their traces/3 are a Markov triple.{{citation
