Symmetric hypergraph theorem




Symmetric hypergraph theorem

The Symmetric hypergraph theorem is a theorem in combinatorics that puts an upper bound on the chromatic number of a graph (or hypergraph in general). The original reference for this paper is unknown at the moment, and has been called folklore.1
Statement
A group

acting on a set

 
  is called transitive if given any two elements 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , there exists an element 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . A graph (or hypergraph) is called symmetric if its automorphism group is transitive.
Theorem. Let 
 
 
 
  be a symmetric hypergraph. Let 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  denote the chromatic number of 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  denote the independence number of 
 
 
 
 . Then





Applications
This theorem has applications to Ramsey theory, specifically graph Ramsey theory. Using this theorem, a relationship between the graph Ramsey numbers and the extremal numbers can be shown (see Graham-Rothschild-Spencer for the details).
