   Symmetric hypergraph theorem      Symmetric hypergraph theorem   The Symmetric hypergraph theorem is a theorem in combinatorics that puts an upper bound on the chromatic number of a graph (or hypergraph in general). The original reference for this paper is unknown at the moment, and has been called folklore . 1  Statement  A group    G   G   G    acting on a set    S   S   S   is called transitive if given any two elements   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   in   S   S   S   , there exists an element   f   f   f   of   G   G   G   such that     f   (  x  )    =  y        f  x   y    f(x)=y   . A graph (or hypergraph) is called symmetric if its automorphism group is transitive.  Theorem. Let    H  =   (  S  ,  E  )       H   S  E     H=(S,E)   be a symmetric hypergraph. Let    m  =   |  S  |       m    S     m=|S|   , and let    χ   (  H  )       χ  H    \chi(H)   denote the chromatic number of   H   H   H   , and let    α   (  H  )       α  H    \alpha(H)   denote the independence number of   H   H   H   . Then         χ   (  H  )    <   1  +    m   α   (  H  )      ln  m      .        χ  H     1      m    α  H      m       \chi(H)<1+\frac{m}{\alpha(H)}\ln m.      Applications  This theorem has applications to Ramsey theory , specifically graph Ramsey theory . Using this theorem, a relationship between the graph Ramsey numbers and the extremal numbers can be shown (see Graham-Rothschild-Spencer for the details).
