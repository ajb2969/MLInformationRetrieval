Succinate—CoA ligase (ADP-forming)




Succinate—CoA ligase (ADP-forming)

In enzymology, a succinate-CoA ligase (ADP-forming) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + succinate + CoA $\rightleftharpoons$ ADP + phosphate + succinyl-CoA
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, succinate, and CoA, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and succinyl-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is succinate:CoA ligase (ADP-forming). Other names in common use include succinyl-CoA synthetase (ADP-forming), succinic thiokinase, succinate thiokinase, succinyl-CoA synthetase, succinyl coenzyme A synthetase (adenosine diphosphate-forming), succinyl coenzyme A synthetase, A-STK (adenin nucleotide-linked succinate thiokinase), STK, and A-SCS. This enzyme participates in 4 metabolic pathways: Citric acid cycle, propanoate metabolism, c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism, and reductive carboxylate cycle (CO2 fixation).
