   Ketol-acid reductoisomerase      Ketol-acid reductoisomerase   In enzymology , a ketol-acid reductoisomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (S)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-oxobutanoate + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are (S)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-oxobutanoate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate:NADP + oxidoreductase (isomerizing) . Other names in common use include dihydroxyisovalerate dehydrogenase (isomerizing) , acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase , ketol acid reductoisomerase , alpha-keto-beta-hydroxylacyl reductoisomerase , 2-hydroxy-3-keto acid reductoisomerase , acetohydroxy acid reductoisomerase , acetolactate reductoisomerase , dihydroxyisovalerate (isomerizing) dehydrogenase , isomeroreductase , and reductoisomerase . This enzyme participates in valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and pantothenate and coa biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
