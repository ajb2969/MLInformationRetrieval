Phenylacetate—CoA ligase




Phenylacetate—CoA ligase

In enzymology, a phenylacetate-CoA ligase is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + phenylacetate + CoA 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + phenylacetyl-CoA
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, phenylacetate, and CoA, whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and phenylacetyl-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phenylacetate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming). Other names in common use include phenylacetyl-CoA ligase, PA-CoA ligase, and phenylacetyl-CoA ligase (AMP-forming). This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism and phenylalanine metabolism.
