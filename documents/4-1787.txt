   Differential of the first kind      Differential of the first kind   In mathematics , differential of the first kind is a traditional term used in the theories of Riemann surfaces (more generally, complex manifolds ) and algebraic curves (more generally, algebraic varieties ), for everywhere-regular differential 1-forms . Given a complex manifold M , a differential of the first kind ω is therefore the same thing as a 1-form that is everywhere holomorphic ; on an algebraic variety  V that is non-singular it would be a global section of the coherent sheaf Ω 1 of Kähler differentials . In either case the definition has its origins in the theory of abelian integrals .  The dimension of the space of differentials of the first kind, by means of this identification, is the Hodge number   h 1,0 .   The differentials of the first kind, when integrated along paths, give rise to integrals that generalise the elliptic integrals to all curves over the complex numbers . They include for example the hyperelliptic integrals of type      ∫      x  k    d  x     Q   (  x  )               superscript  x  k   d  x       Q  x       \int\frac{x^{k}\,dx}{\sqrt{Q(x)}}     where Q is a square-free polynomial of any given degree > 4. The allowable power k has to be determined by analysis of the possible pole at the point at infinity on the corresponding hyperelliptic curve . When this is done, one finds that the condition is   k ≤ g − 1,   or in other words, k at most 1 for degree of Q 5 or 6, at most 2 for degree 7 or 8, and so on (as g = [(1+ deg Q )/2]).  Quite generally, as this example illustrates, for a compact Riemann surface or algebraic curve , the Hodge number is the genus  g . For the case of algebraic surfaces , this is the quantity known classically as the irregularity  q . It is also, in general, the dimension of the Albanese variety , which takes the place of the Jacobian variety .  Differentials of the second and third kind  The traditional terminology also included differentials of the second kind and of the third kind . The idea behind this has been supported by modern theories of algebraic differential forms , both from the side of more Hodge theory , and through the use of morphisms to commutative  algebraic groups .  The Weierstrass zeta function was called an integral of the second kind in elliptic function theory; it is a logarithmic derivative of a theta function , and therefore has simple poles , with integer residues. The decomposition of a ( meromorphic ) elliptic function into pieces of 'three kinds' parallels the representation as (i) a constant, plus (ii) a linear combination of translates of the Weierstrass zeta function, plus (iii) a function with arbitrary poles but no residues at them.  The same type of decomposition exists in general, mutatis mutandis , though the terminology is not completely consistent. In the algebraic group ( generalized Jacobian ) theory the three kinds are abelian varieties , algebraic tori , and affine spaces , and the decomposition is in terms of a composition series .  On the other hand, a meromorphic abelian differential of the second kind has traditionally been one with residues at all poles being zero. There is a higher-dimensional analogue available, using the Poincaré residue  See also  Logarithmic form  "  Category:Complex manifolds  Category:Algebraic geometry
