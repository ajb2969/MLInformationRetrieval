In many programming languages, '''map''' is the name of a higher-order function that applies a given function to each element of a list, returning a list of results. It is often called apply-to-all when considered in functional form. This is an example of functoriality.
For example, if we define a function square as follows:
square x = x * x
Then calling map square [1,2,3,4,5] will return [1,4,9,16,25], as map will go through the list and apply the function square to each element.
Generalization
In the Haskell programming language, the polymorphic function  map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b] is generalized to a polytypic function called fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b, which applies to any type in the Functor class.
map is used in Haskell's Prelude to define the list type constructor ([]) an instance of the Functor type class as follows
 instance Functor [] where fmap = map
But trees may belong to Functor too, for example:
 data Tree a = Leaf a | Fork (Tree a) (Tree a)
  instance Functor Tree where  
    fmap f (Leaf x) = Leaf (f x)
    fmap f (Fork l r) = Fork (fmap f l) (fmap f r)
 
  fmap (1+) (Fork(Fork(Leaf 0)(Leaf 1))(Fork(Leaf 2)(Leaf 3)))
evaluates to:
 Fork (Fork(Leaf 1)(Leaf 2))(Fork(Leaf 3)(Leaf 4))
For every instance of the Functor type class, fmap is expected to be defined such that it obeys the functor laws:
fmap id = id -- identity
 fmap (f . g) = fmap f . fmap g -- composition
Among other uses, this allows defining element-wise operations for various kinds of collections.
Moreover, if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are two functors, a natural transformation is a function of polymorphic type 
 
 
 
  which respects fmap:


 
  for any function 
 
 
 
 .
If the h function is defined by parametric polymorphism as in the type definition above, this specification is always satisfied.
Optimizations
The mathematical basis of maps allow for a number of optimizations. If one has (map f . map g) xs ('.' is function composition) then it is the same as the simpler map (f . g) xs; that is, 
 
 
 
 . This particular optimization eliminates an expensive second map by fusing it with the first map; thus it is a "map fusion".1
Map functions can be and often are defined in terms of a fold such as foldr, which means one can do a "map-fold fusion": foldr f z . map g is equivalent to foldr (f . g) z.
The implementation of map above on singly linked lists is not tail-recursive, so it may build up a lot of frames on the stack when called with a large list. Many languages alternately provide a "reverse map" function, which is equivalent to reversing a mapped list, but is tail-recursive. Here is an implementation which utilizes the fold-left function.
 rev_map f = foldl (\ys x -> f x : ys) []
Since reversing a singly linked list is also tail-recursive, reverse and reverse-map can be composed to perform normal map in a tail-recursive way.
Language comparison
The map function originated in functional programming languages but is today supported (or may be defined) in many procedural, object oriented, and multi-paradigm languages as well: In C++'s Standard Template Library, it is called transform, in C# (3.0)'s LINQ library, it is provided as an extension method called Select. Map is also a frequently used operation in high level languages such as CFML, Perl, Python and Ruby; the operation is called map in all four of these languages. A collect alias for map is also provided in Ruby (from Smalltalk). Common Lisp provides a family of map-like functions; the one corresponding to the behavior described here is called mapcar (-car indicating access using the CAR operation). There are also languages with syntactic constructs providing the same functionality as the map function.
Map is sometimes generalized to accept dyadic (2-argument) functions that can apply a user-supplied function to corresponding elements from two lists; some languages use special names for this, such as map2 or zipWith. Languages using explicit variadic functions may have versions of map with variable arity to support variable-arity functions. Map with 2 or more lists encounters the issue of handling when the lists are of different lengths. Various languages differ on this; some raise an exception, some stop after the length of the shortest list and ignore extra items on the other lists; some continue on to the length of the longest list, and for the lists that have already ended, pass some placeholder value to the function indicating no value.
In languages which support first-class functions, map may be partially applied to "lift" functions to element-wise versions; for instance, (map square) is a Haskell function which squares lists element-wise.




Map in various languages

Language

Map

Map n lists

Notes

Handling lists of different lengths



Common Lisp

(mapcar ''func'' ''list'')

(mapcar ''func'' ''list1'' ''list2'')

(mapcar ''func'' ''list1'' ''list2'' ...)


stops after the length of the shortest list



C++

std::transform(''begin'', ''end'', ''result'', ''func'')

C# 3.0

''ienum''.Select(''func'')



Select is an extension method
ienum is an IEnumerable
  Similarly in all .NET languages




C# 4.0

''ienum''.Select(''func'')

''ienum1''.Zip(''ienum2'', ''func'')


Select is an extension method
ienum is an IEnumerable
  Similarly in all .NET languages

stops after the shortest list ends



CFML

obj.map(func)



Where obj is an array or a structure. func receives as arguments each item's value, its index or key, and a reference to the original object.




Clojure

(map ''func'' ''list'')

(map ''func'' ''list1'' ''list2'')

(map ''func'' ''list1'' ''list2'' ...)

''List1''.map(function (elem1, i) { return ''func''(elem1, ''List2''[i], ''List3''[i], ...); })

Array#map passes 3 arguments to func: the element, the index of the element, and the array. Unused arguments can be omitted.

Stops at the end of List1, extending the shorter arrays with undefined items if needed.

map(''func'', ''list1'', ''list2'')

map(''func'', ''list1'', ''list2'', ...)

Returns a list in Python 2 and an iterator in Python 3.
