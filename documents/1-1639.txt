   Power number      Power number    For Newton number , see also Kissing number in the sphere packing problem   The power number  N p (also known as Newton number ) is a commonly used dimensionless number relating the resistance force to the inertia force .  The power-number has different specifications according to the field of application. E.g., for stirrers the power number is defined as:       N  p   =   P   ρ   n  3    d  5          subscript  N  normal-p     P    ρ   superscript  n  3    superscript  d  5       N_{\mathrm{p}}={P\over\rho n^{3}d^{5}}     with   P : power  ρ : fluid  density  n : rotational speed  d : diameter of stirrer 1   References  See also   Reynolds number  Archimedes number   "  Category:Dimensionless numbers of fluid mechanics  Category:Fluid dynamics     J Wei, J L Anderson, K B Bischoff Advances in Chemical Engineering, Volume 17 Academic Press (1991) ISBN 0-12-008517-8 page 44 ↩
