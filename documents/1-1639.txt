The power number Np (also known as Newton number) is a commonly used dimensionless number relating the resistance force to the inertia force.
The power-number has different specifications according to the field of application. E.g., for stirrers the power number is defined as:



with

P: power
œÅ: fluid density
n: rotational speed
d: diameter of stirrer 1
