   1-Deoxy-11beta-hydroxypentalenate dehydrogenase      1-Deoxy-11beta-hydroxypentalenate dehydrogenase   1-deoxy-11beta-hydroxypentalenate dehydrogenase (, 1-deoxy-11beta-hydroxypentalenic acid dehydrogenase , ptlF (gene) , penF (gene name) ) is an enzyme with system name 1-deoxy-11beta-hydroxypentalenate:NAD + oxidoreductase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   1-deoxy-11beta-hydroxypentalenate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-deoxy-11-oxopentalenate + NADH + H +    This enzyme from the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis participates in pentalenolactone biosynthesis.
