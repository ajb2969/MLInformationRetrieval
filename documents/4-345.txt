   L-theory      L-theory   In mathematics algebraic L-theory is the K-theory of quadratic forms ; the term was coined by C. T. C. Wall , with L being used as the letter after K . Algebraic L -theory, also known as 'hermitian K -theory', is important in surgery theory .  Definition  One can define L -groups for any ring with involution  R : the quadratic L -groups     L  *    (  R  )        subscript  L    R    L_{*}(R)   (Wall) and the symmetric L -groups     L  *    (  R  )        superscript  L    R    L^{*}(R)   (Mishchenko, Ranicki).  Even dimension  The even-dimensional L -groups     L   2  k     (  R  )        subscript  L    2  k    R    L_{2k}(R)   are defined as the Witt groups of ε-quadratic forms over the ring R with    ϵ  =    (   -  1   )   k       ϵ   superscript    1   k     \epsilon=(-1)^{k}   . More precisely,       L   2  k     (  R  )        subscript  L    2  k    R    L_{2k}(R)     is the abelian group of equivalence classes    [  ψ  ]     delimited-[]  ψ    [\psi]   of non-degenerate ε-quadratic forms    ψ  ∈    Q  ϵ    (  F  )        ψ     subscript  Q  ϵ   F     \psi\in Q_{\epsilon}(F)   over R, where the underlying R-modules F are finitely generated free. The equivalence relation is given by stabilization with respect to hyperbolic ε-quadratic forms :        [  ψ  ]   =   [   ψ  ′   ]    ⟺    n  ,   n  ′    ∈   ℕ  0    :    ψ  ⊕    H    (   -  1   )   k      (  R  )   n     ≅    ψ  ′   ⊕    H    (   -  1   )   k      (  R  )    n  ′            normal-⟺     delimited-[]  ψ    delimited-[]   superscript  ψ  normal-′        n   superscript  n  normal-′     subscript  ℕ  0      normal-:       direct-sum  ψ     subscript  H   superscript    1   k     superscript  R  n      direct-sum   superscript  ψ  normal-′      subscript  H   superscript    1   k     superscript  R   superscript  n  normal-′          [\psi]=[\psi^{\prime}]\Longleftrightarrow n,n^{\prime}\in{\mathbb{N}}_{0}:\psi%
 \oplus H_{(-1)^{k}}(R)^{n}\cong\psi^{\prime}\oplus H_{(-1)^{k}}(R)^{n^{\prime}}   .  The addition in     L   2  k     (  R  )        subscript  L    2  k    R    L_{2k}(R)   is defined by         [   ψ  1   ]   +   [   ψ  2   ]    :=   [    ψ  1   ⊕   ψ  2    ]    .     assign     delimited-[]   subscript  ψ  1     delimited-[]   subscript  ψ  2      delimited-[]   direct-sum   subscript  ψ  1    subscript  ψ  2       [\psi_{1}]+[\psi_{2}]:=[\psi_{1}\oplus\psi_{2}].     The zero element is represented by     H    (   -  1   )   k      (  R  )   n        subscript  H   superscript    1   k     superscript  R  n     H_{(-1)^{k}}(R)^{n}   for any    n  ∈   ℕ  0       n   subscript  ℕ  0     n\in{\mathbb{N}}_{0}   . The inverse of    [  ψ  ]     delimited-[]  ψ    [\psi]   is    [   -  ψ   ]     delimited-[]    ψ     [-\psi]   .  Odd dimension  Defining odd-dimensional L -groups is more complicated; further details and the definition of the odd-dimensional L -groups can be found in the references mentioned below.  Examples and applications  The L -groups of a group   π   π   \pi   are the L -groups     L  *    (   𝐙   [  π  ]    )        subscript  L      𝐙   delimited-[]  π      L_{*}(\mathbf{Z}[\pi])   of the group ring     𝐙   [  π  ]       𝐙   delimited-[]  π     \mathbf{Z}[\pi]   . In the applications to topology   π   π   \pi   is the fundamental group      π  1    (  X  )        subscript  π  1   X    \pi_{1}(X)   of a space   X   X   X   . The quadratic L -groups     L  *    (   𝐙   [  π  ]    )        subscript  L      𝐙   delimited-[]  π      L_{*}(\mathbf{Z}[\pi])   play a central role in the surgery classification of the homotopy types of   n   n   n   -dimensional manifolds of dimension    n  >  4      n  4    n>4   , and in the formulation of the Novikov conjecture .  The distinction between symmetric L -groups and quadratic L -groups, indicated by upper and lower indices, reflects the usage in group homology and cohomology. The group cohomology     H  *     superscript  H     H^{*}   of the cyclic group    𝐙  2     subscript  𝐙  2    \mathbf{Z}_{2}   deals with the fixed points of a    𝐙  2     subscript  𝐙  2    \mathbf{Z}_{2}   -action, while the group homology     H  *     subscript  H     H_{*}   deals with the orbits of a    𝐙  2     subscript  𝐙  2    \mathbf{Z}_{2}   -action; compare    X  G     superscript  X  G    X^{G}   (fixed points) and     X  G   =   X  /  G        subscript  X  G     X  G     X_{G}=X/G   (orbits, quotient) for upper/lower index notation.  The quadratic L -groups     L  n    (  R  )        subscript  L  n   R    L_{n}(R)   and the symmetric L -groups     L  n    (  R  )        superscript  L  n   R    L^{n}(R)   are related by a symmetrization map      L  n    (  R  )    →    L  n    (  R  )       normal-→     subscript  L  n   R      superscript  L  n   R     L_{n}(R)\to L^{n}(R)   which is an isomorphism modulo 2-torsion, and which corresponds to the polarization identities .  The quadratic L -groups are 4-fold periodic. Symmetric L -groups are not 4-periodic in general (see Ranicki, page 12), though they are for the integers.  In view of the applications to the classification of manifolds there are extensive calculations of the quadratic   L   L   L   -groups     L  *    (   𝐙   [  π  ]    )        subscript  L      𝐙   delimited-[]  π      L_{*}(\mathbf{Z}[\pi])   . For finite   π   π   \pi   algebraic methods are used, and mostly geometric methods (e.g. controlled topology) are used for infinite   π   π   \pi   .  More generally, one can define L -groups for any additive category with a chain duality , as in Ranicki (section 1).  Integers  The simply connected L -groups are also the L -groups of the integers, as     L   (  e  )    :=   L   (   𝐙   [  e  ]    )    =   L   (  𝐙  )         assign    L  e     L    𝐙   delimited-[]  e            L  𝐙      L(e):=L(\mathbf{Z}[e])=L(\mathbf{Z})   for both   L   L   L   =    L  *     superscript  L     L^{*}   or     L  *   .     subscript  L     L_{*}.   For quadratic L -groups, these are the surgery obstructions to simply connected surgery.  The quadratic L -groups of the integers are:       L   4  k     (  𝐙  )        subscript  L    4  k    𝐙    \displaystyle L_{4k}(\mathbf{Z})   In doubly even dimension (4 k ), the quadratic L -groups detect the signature ; in singly even dimension (4 k +2), the L -groups detect the Arf invariant (topologically the Kervaire invariant ).  The symmetric L -groups of the integers are:       L   4  k     (  𝐙  )        superscript  L    4  k    𝐙    \displaystyle L^{4k}(\mathbf{Z})   In doubly even dimension (4 k ), the symmetric L -groups, as with the quadratic L -groups, detect the signature; in dimension (4 k +1), the L -groups detect the de Rham invariant .
