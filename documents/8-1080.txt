   Varifold      Varifold   In mathematics , a varifold is, loosely speaking, a measure-theoretic generalization of the concept of a differentiable manifold , by replacing differentiability requirements with those provided by rectifiable sets , while maintaining the general algebraic structure usually seen in differential geometry . More closely, the varifold generalize the idea of a rectifiable current . Varifolds are one of the topics of study in geometric measure theory .  Historical note  Varifolds were first introduced by L.C. Young in , under the name " generalized surfaces ". 1 2  Frederick Almgren slightly modified the definition in his mimeographed notes  and coined the name varifold : he wanted to emphasize that these objects are substitutes for ordinary manifolds in problems of the calculus of variations . 3 The modern approach to the theory was based on Almgren's notes 4 and laid down by William Allard , in the paper .  Definition  Given an open subset   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   of Euclidean space ℝ n , an m -dimensional varifold on   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is defined as a Radon measure on the set       Ω  ×  G    (  n  ,  m  )         normal-Ω  G    n  m     \Omega\times G(n,m)     where    G   (  n  ,  m  )       G   n  m     G(n,m)   is the Grassmannian of all m -dimensional linear subspaces of an n -dimensional vector space. The Grassmannian is used to allow the construction of analogs to differential forms as duals to vector fields in the approximate tangent space of the set   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   .  The particular case of a rectifiable varifold is the data of a m -rectifiable set M (which is measurable with respect to the m -dimensional Hausdorff measure), and a density function defined on M , which is a positive function θ measurable and locally integrable with respect to the m -dimensional Hausdorff measure. It defines a Radon measure V on the Grassmannian bundle of ℝ n       V   (  A  )    :=     ∫   Γ   M  ,  A       θ   (  x  )   d   ℋ  m    (  x  )        assign    V  A     subscript    subscript  normal-Γ   M  A       θ  x  normal-d   superscript  ℋ  m   x      V(A):=\int_{\Gamma_{M,A}}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\theta(x)\mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}^{m}(x)     where        Γ   M  ,  A    =   M  ∩   {  x  :    (  x  ,    Tan  m    (  x  ,  M  )    )   ∈  A   }         subscript  normal-Γ   M  A      M   conditional-set  x     x     superscript  Tan  m    x  M     A       \scriptstyle\Gamma_{M,A}=M\cap\{x:(x,\mathrm{Tan}^{m}(x,M))\in A\}          ℋ  m    (  x  )        superscript  ℋ  m   x    \scriptstyle\mathcal{H}^{m}(x)   is the    m   m   m   −dimensional  Hausdorff measure   Rectifiable varifolds are weaker objects than locally rectifiable currents: they do not have any orientation . Replacing M with more regular sets, one easily see that differentiable submanifolds are particular cases of rectifiable manifolds .  Due to the lack of orientation , there is no boundary operator defined on the space of varifolds.
