Varifold

In mathematics, a varifold is, loosely speaking, a measure-theoretic generalization of the concept of a differentiable manifold, by replacing differentiability requirements with those provided by rectifiable sets, while maintaining the general algebraic structure usually seen in differential geometry. More closely, the varifold generalize the idea of a rectifiable current. Varifolds are one of the topics of study in geometric measure theory.
Historical note
Varifolds were first introduced by L.C. Young in , under the name "generalized surfaces".12 Frederick Almgren slightly modified the definition in his mimeographed notes  and coined the name varifold: he wanted to emphasize that these objects are substitutes for ordinary manifolds in problems of the calculus of variations.3 The modern approach to the theory was based on Almgren's notes4 and laid down by William Allard, in the paper .
Definition
Given an open subset 
 
 
 
  of Euclidean space ℝn, an m-dimensional varifold on 
 
 
 
  is defined as a Radon measure on the set



where 
 
 
 
  is the Grassmannian of all m-dimensional linear subspaces of an n-dimensional vector space. The Grassmannian is used to allow the construction of analogs to differential forms as duals to vector fields in the approximate tangent space of the set 
 
 
 
 .
The particular case of a rectifiable varifold is the data of a m-rectifiable set M (which is measurable with respect to the m-dimensional Hausdorff measure), and a density function defined on M, which is a positive function θ measurable and locally integrable with respect to the m-dimensional Hausdorff measure. It defines a Radon measure V on the Grassmannian bundle of ℝn

  is the 

 
 −dimensional Hausdorff measure

Rectifiable varifolds are weaker objects than locally rectifiable currents: they do not have any orientation. Replacing M with more regular sets, one easily see that differentiable submanifolds are particular cases of rectifiable manifolds.
Due to the lack of orientation, there is no boundary operator defined on the space of varifolds.

In his commemorative papers describing the research of Almgren,  writes that these are "essentially the same class of surfaces".

 exactly writes:-"I called the objects "varifolds" having in mind that they were a measure-theoretic substitute for manifolds created for the variational calculus". As a matter of fact, the name is a portmanteau of variational manifold.
The first widely circulated exposition of Almgren's ideas is the book : however, the first systematic exposition of the theory is contained in the mimeographed notes , which had a far lower circulation, even if it is cited in Herbert Federer's classic text on geometric measure theory.
