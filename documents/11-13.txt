   Tartronate-semialdehyde synthase      Tartronate-semialdehyde synthase   In enzymology , a tartronate-semialdehyde synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 glyoxylate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   tartronate semialdehyde + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , glyoxylate , and two products , tartronate semialdehyde and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glyoxylate carboxy-lyase (dimerizing tartronate-semialdehyde-forming) . Other names in common use include tartronate semialdehyde carboxylase , glyoxylate carbo-ligase , glyoxylic carbo-ligase , hydroxymalonic semialdehyde carboxylase , tartronic semialdehyde carboxylase , glyoxalate carboligase , and glyoxylate carboxy-lyase (dimerizing) . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism . It has 2 cofactors : FAD , and Thiamin diphosphate .
