Reality structure

In mathematics, a reality structure on a complex vector space V is a decomposition of V into two real subspaces, called the real and imaginary parts of V:


 
  Here VR is a real subspace of V, i.e. a subspace of V considered as a vector space over the real numbers. If V has complex dimension n (real dimension 2n), then VR must have real dimension n.
The standard reality structure on the vector space 
 
 
 
  is the decomposition



In the presence of a reality structure, every vector in V has a real part and an imaginary part, each of which is a vector in VR:


 
  In this case, the complex conjugate of a vector v is defined as follows:


 
  This map 
 
 
 
  is an antilinear involution, i.e.



Conversely, given an antilinear involution 
 
 
 
  on a complex vector space V, it is possible to define a reality structure on V as follows. Let


 
  and define


 
  Then


 
  This is actually the decomposition of V as the eigenspaces of the real linear operator c. The eigenvalues of c are +1 and −1, with eigenspaces VR and 
 
 
 
  VR, respectively. Typically, the operator c itself, rather than the eigenspace decomposition it entails, is referred to as the reality structure on V.
