   Mg2+-importing ATPase      Mg2+-importing ATPase   In enzymology , a Mg 2+ -importing ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O + Mg 2 +out   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + Mg 2 +in   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , H 2 O , and Mg 2+ , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and Mg 2+ .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (Mg 2+ -importing) .  The mgtA gene which encodes this enzyme is thought to be regulated by a magnesium responsive RNA element . 1  References  :*  :*  "  Category:EC 3.6.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure     ↩
