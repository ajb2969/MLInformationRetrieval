Mg2+-importing ATPase




Mg2+-importing ATPase

In enzymology, a Mg2+-importing ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + H2O + Mg2+out 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + Mg2+in
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, H2O, and Mg2+, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and Mg2+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (Mg2+-importing).
The mgtA gene which encodes this enzyme is thought to be regulated by a magnesium responsive RNA element.1
