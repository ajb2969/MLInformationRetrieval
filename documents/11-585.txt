   Binder parameter      Binder parameter   The Binder parameter 1 in statistical physics , also known as the fourth-order culumant     U  L   =   1  -     ⟨   s  4   ⟩   L    3    ⟨   s  2   ⟩   L  2           subscript  U  L     1     subscript   delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  s  4    L     3   subscript   superscript   delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  s  2    2   L        U_{L}=1-\frac{{\langle s^{4}\rangle}_{L}}{3{\langle s^{2}\rangle}^{2}_{L}}   in Ising model, 2 is used to identify phase transition points in numerical simulations. It is defined as the kurtosis of the order parameter. For example in spin glasses one defines the Binder as      B  =    1  2    (   3  -     ⟨   q  4   ⟩   ¯      ⟨   q  2   ⟩   ¯   2     )        B      1  2     3     normal-¯   delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  q  4      superscript   normal-¯   delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  q  2     2        {B=\frac{1}{2}\left(3-\frac{\overline{\langle q^{4}\rangle}}{\overline{\langle
 q%
 ^{2}\rangle}^{2}}\right)}     where    ⟨  ⋅  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  normal-⋅    \langle\cdot\rangle   stands for Boltzmann average,    ⋅  ¯     normal-¯  normal-⋅    \overline{\cdot}   for average over the disorder and   q   q   q   is the overlap between two identical replicas of the system. The phase transition point is usually identified comparing the behavior of   B   B   B   as a function of the temperature for different values of the system size   L   L   L   . The transition temperature is the unique point where the different curves cross. This is based on finite size scaling hypothesis, according to which, in the critical region    T  ≈   T  c       T   subscript  T  c     T\approx T_{c}   the Binder behaves as     B   (  T  ,  L  )    =   b   (   ϵ   L   1  /  ν     )          B   T  L      b    ϵ   superscript  L    1  ν        B(T,L)=b(\epsilon L^{1/\nu})   , where    ϵ  =    T  -   T  c    T       ϵ      T   subscript  T  c    T     \epsilon=\frac{T-T_{c}}{T}   .
