   Unistochastic matrix      Unistochastic matrix   In mathematics , a unistochastic matrix (also called unitary-stochastic ) is a doubly stochastic matrix whose entries are the squares of the absolute values of the entries of some unitary matrix .  A square matrix B of size n is doubly stochastic (or bistochastic ) if all its entries are non-negative real numbers and each of its rows and columns sum to 1. It is unistochastic if there exists a unitary matrix U such that         B   i  j    =     |   U   i  j    |   2   for  i    ,   j  =   1  ,  …  ,  n     .     formulae-sequence     subscript  B    i  j       superscript     subscript  U    i  j     2   for  i      j   1  normal-…  n      B_{ij}=|U_{ij}|^{2}\text{ for }i,j=1,\dots,n.\,     All 2-by-2 doubly stochastic matrices are unistochastic and orthostochastic , but for larger n it is not the case. Already for    n  =  3      n  3    n=3   there exists a bistochastic matrix B which is not unistochastic:      B  =    1  2    [     1    1    0      0    1    1      1    0    1     ]        B      1  2     1  1  0    0  1  1    1  0  1       B=\frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}1&1&0\\
 0&1&1\\
 1&0&1\end{bmatrix}   since any two vectors with moduli equal to the square root of the entries of two columns (rows) of B cannot be made orthogonal by a suitable choice of phases.  Properties   the set of unistochastic matrices contains all permutation matrices  for    n  ≥  3      n  3    n\geq 3   this set is not convex  for    n  =  3      n  3    n=3   the set of unistochastic matrices is star shaped .  for    n  =  3      n  3    n=3   the relative volume of the set of unistochastic matrices with respect to the Birkhoff polytope of bistochastic matrices is      8   π  2    /  105   ≈   75.2  %           8   superscript  π  2    105    percent  75.2     8\pi^{2}/105\approx 75.2\%      References    .
