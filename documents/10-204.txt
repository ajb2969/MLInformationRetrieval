Unistochastic matrix

In mathematics, a unistochastic matrix (also called unitary-stochastic) is a doubly stochastic matrix whose entries are the squares of the absolute values of the entries of some unitary matrix.
A square matrix B of size n is doubly stochastic (or bistochastic) if all its entries are non-negative real numbers and each of its rows and columns sum to 1. It is unistochastic if there exists a unitary matrix U such that



All 2-by-2 doubly stochastic matrices are unistochastic and orthostochastic, but for larger n it is not the case. Already for 
 
 
 
  there exists a bistochastic matrix B which is not unistochastic:


 
  since any two vectors with moduli equal to the square root of the entries of two columns (rows) of B cannot be made orthogonal by a suitable choice of phases.
