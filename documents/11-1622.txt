   Thiamine-diphosphate kinase      Thiamine-diphosphate kinase   In enzymology , a thiamine-diphosphate kinase is an enzyme involved in thiamine metabolism . It catalyzes the chemical reaction   thiamine diphosphate + ATP   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   thiamine triphosphate + ADP   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and thiamine diphosphate , whereas its two products are ADP and thiamine triphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with a phosphate group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:thiamine-diphosphate phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include ATP:thiamin-diphosphate phosphotransferase , TDP kinase , thiamin diphosphate kinase , thiamin diphosphate phosphotransferase , thiamin pyrophosphate kinase , thiamine diphosphate kinase , and protein bound thiamin diphosphate:ATP phosphoryltransferase .
