   Aldose 1-epimerase      Aldose 1-epimerase   In enzymology , an aldose 1-epimerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   alpha-D-glucose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   beta-D-glucose   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , alpha-D-glucose , and one product , beta-D-glucose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on carbohydrates and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aldose 1-epimerase . Other names in common use include mutarotase , and aldose mutarotase . This enzyme participates in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 23 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
