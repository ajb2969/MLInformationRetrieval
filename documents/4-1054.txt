Joint entropy

(Figure)
Venn diagram for various information measures associated with correlated variables X and Y. The area contained by both circles is the joint entropy H(X,Y). The circle on the left (red and violet) is the individual entropy H(X), with the red being the conditional entropy H(X|Y). The circle on the right (blue and violet) is H(Y), with the blue being H(Y|X). The violet is the mutual information I(X;Y).

In information theory, joint entropy is a measure of the uncertainty associated with a set of variables.
Definition
The joint Shannon entropy of two variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is defined as



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are particular values of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively, 
 
 
 
  is the joint probability of these values occurring together, and 
 
 
 
  is defined to be 0 if 
 
 
 
 .
For more than two variables 
 
 
 
  this expands to



where 
 
 
 
  are particular values of 
 
 
 
 , respectively, 
 
 
 
  is the probability of these values occurring together, and 
 
 
 
  is defined to be 0 if 
 
 
 
 .
Properties
Greater than individual entropies
The joint entropy of a set of variables is greater than or equal to all of the individual entropies of the variables in the set.






Less than or equal to the sum of individual entropies
The joint entropy of a set of variables is less than or equal to the sum of the individual entropies of the variables in the set. This is an example of subadditivity. This inequality is an equality if and only if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are statistically independent.






Relations to other entropy measures
Joint entropy is used in the definition of conditional entropy



and mutual information



In quantum information theory, the joint entropy is generalized into the joint quantum entropy.
