IMD3

IMD3 refers to the intermodulation distortion from the third order of a circuit. It is of particular importance in narrow band signals because its distortion is often in the signal band. This can be seen by looking at a signal that is made up of two sine waves, one at 
 
 
 
  and one at 
 
 
 
 . When you cube the sum of these sine waves you will get sine waves at various frequencies including 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are large but very close together then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  will be very close to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
