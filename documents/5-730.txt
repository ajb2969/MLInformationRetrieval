   IMD3      IMD3   IMD3 refers to the intermodulation distortion from the third order of a circuit . It is of particular importance in narrow band signals because its distortion is often in the signal band . This can be seen by looking at a signal that is made up of two sine waves , one at    f  1     subscript  f  1    f_{1}   and one at    f  2     subscript  f  2    f_{2}   . When you cube the sum of these sine waves you will get sine waves at various frequencies including     2  ×   f  2    -   f  1         2   subscript  f  2     subscript  f  1     2\times f_{2}-f_{1}   and     2  ×   f  1    -   f  2         2   subscript  f  1     subscript  f  2     2\times f_{1}-f_{2}   . If    f  1     subscript  f  1    f_{1}   and    f  2     subscript  f  2    f_{2}   are large but very close together then     2  ×   f  2    -   f  1         2   subscript  f  2     subscript  f  1     2\times f_{2}-f_{1}   and     2  ×   f  1    -   f  2         2   subscript  f  1     subscript  f  2     2\times f_{1}-f_{2}   will be very close to    f  1     subscript  f  1    f_{1}   and    f  2     subscript  f  2    f_{2}   .
