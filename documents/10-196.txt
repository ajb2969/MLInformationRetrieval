   Kuratowski convergence      Kuratowski convergence   In mathematics , Kuratowski convergence is a notion of convergence for sequences (or, more generally, nets ) of compact subsets of metric spaces , named after the Polish  mathematician  Kazimierz Kuratowski . Intuitively, the Kuratowski limit of a sequence of sets is where the sets " accumulate ".  Definitions  Let ( X , d ) be a metric space , where X is a set and d is the function of distance between points of X .  For any point x ∈ X and any non-empty compact subset A ⊆ X , define the distance between the point and the subset:       d   (  x  ,  A  )    =   inf   {   d   (  x  ,  a  )    |   a  ∈  A   }          d   x  A     infimum   conditional-set    d   x  a      a  A       d(x,A)=\inf\{d(x,a)|a\in A\}   .  For any sequence of such subsets A n ⊆ X , n ∈ N , the Kuratowski limit inferior (or lower closed limit ) of A n as n → ∞ is        Li   n  →  ∞     A  n    =   {   x  ∈  X   |     lim sup   n  →  ∞     d   (  x  ,   A  n   )     =  0   }         subscript  Li   normal-→  n      subscript  A  n     conditional-set    x  X       subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n       d   x   subscript  A  n      0      \mathop{\mathrm{Li}}_{n\to\infty}A_{n}=\left\{x\in X\left|\limsup_{n\to\infty}%
 d(x,A_{n})=0\right.\right\}             =   {   x  ∈  X   |       for all open neighbourhoods  U  of  x   ,         U  ∩   A  n    ≠   ∅  for large enough  n       }    ;      absent   conditional-set    x  X       for all open neighbourhoods  U  of  x         U   subscript  A  n       for large enough  n         =\left\{x\in X\left|\begin{matrix}\mbox{for all open neighbourhoods }U\mbox{ %
 of }x,\\
 U\cap A_{n}\neq\emptyset\mbox{ for large enough }n\end{matrix}\right.\right\};        the Kuratowski limit superior (or upper closed limit ) of A n as n → ∞ is        Ls   n  →  ∞     A  n    =   {   x  ∈  X   |     lim inf   n  →  ∞     d   (  x  ,   A  n   )     =  0   }         subscript  Ls   normal-→  n      subscript  A  n     conditional-set    x  X       subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n       d   x   subscript  A  n      0      \mathop{\mathrm{Ls}}_{n\to\infty}A_{n}=\left\{x\in X\left|\liminf_{n\to\infty}%
 d(x,A_{n})=0\right.\right\}             =   {   x  ∈  X   |       for all open neighbourhoods  U  of  x   ,         U  ∩   A  n    ≠   ∅  for infinitely many  n       }    .      absent   conditional-set    x  X       for all open neighbourhoods  U  of  x         U   subscript  A  n       for infinitely many  n         =\left\{x\in X\left|\begin{matrix}\mbox{for all open neighbourhoods }U\mbox{ %
 of }x,\\
 U\cap A_{n}\neq\emptyset\mbox{ for infinitely many }n\end{matrix}\right.\right\}.        If the Kuratowski limits inferior and superior agree (i.e. are the same subset of X ), then their common value is called the Kuratowski limit of the sets A n as n → ∞ and denoted Lt n →∞ A n .  The definitions for a general net of compact subsets of X go through mutatis mutandis .  Properties   Although it may seem counter-intuitive that the Kuratowski limit inferior involves the limit superior of the distances, and vice versa , the nomenclature becomes more obvious when one sees that, for any sequence of sets,            Li   n  →  ∞     A  n    ⊆    Ls   n  →  ∞     A  n     .        subscript  Li   normal-→  n      subscript  A  n      subscript  Ls   normal-→  n      subscript  A  n      \mathop{\mathrm{Li}}_{n\to\infty}A_{n}\subseteq\mathop{\mathrm{Ls}}_{n\to%
 \infty}A_{n}.         I.e. the limit inferior is the smaller set and the limit superior the larger one.    The terms upper and lower closed limit stem from the fact that Li n →∞ A n and Ls n →∞ A n are always closed sets in the metric topology on ( X , d ).   Related Concepts  For metric spaces X we have the following:   Kuratowski convergence coincides with convergence in Fell topology .  Kuratowski convergence is weaker than convergence in Vietoris topology .  Kuratowski convergence is weaker than convergence in Hausdorff metric .  For compact metric spaces X , Kuratowski convergence coincides with both convergence in Hausdorff metric and Vietoris topology.   Examples   Let A n be the zero set of sin( nx ) as a function of x from R to itself           A  n   =   {   x  ∈  𝐑   |    sin   (   n  x   )    =  0   }    .       subscript  A  n    conditional-set    x  𝐑         n  x    0      A_{n}=\big\{x\in\mathbf{R}\big|\sin(nx)=0\big\}.         Then A n converges in the Kuratowski sense to the whole real line R . Observe that in this case, the A n do not need to be compact.
