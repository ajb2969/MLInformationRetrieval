   Carnitine O-octanoyltransferase      Carnitine O-octanoyltransferase   In enzymology , a carnitine O-octanoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   octanoyl-CoA + L-carnitine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + L-octanoylcarnitine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are octanoyl-CoA and L-carnitine , whereas its two products are CoA and L-octanoylcarnitine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is octanoyl-CoA:L-carnitine O-octanoyltransferase . Other names in common use include medium-chain/long-chain carnitine acyltransferase , carnitine medium-chain acyltransferase , easily solubilized mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase , and overt mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
