   Robust associations of massive baryonic objects      Robust associations of massive baryonic objects   In astronomy, a RAMBO or robust association of massive baryonic objects is a dark cluster made of brown dwarfs or white dwarfs .  Introduction  RAMBOs were proposed by Moore and Silk in 1995. They may have an effective radius between 1 and 15 pc , with masses in the range 10–100,000    M  ⊙     subscript  M  direct-product    M_{\odot}   (solar masses). 1  Dynamics  The dynamics of these objects, if they do exist, must be quite different from that of standard star clusters. With a very narrow mass range (all brown dwarfs or white dwarfs), the evaporation rate of these RAMBOs should be very slow as predicted by the evolution of simulated mono-component cluster models. 2 Theoretically, these very long-lived objects could exist in large numbers. The presence of a clustered thick disk-like component of dark matter in the Galaxy has been suggested by Sanchez-Salcedo (1997, 1999) and Kerins (1997). 3 4 5  See also   Dark matter  Brown dwarfs  White dwarfs  Microlensing  Hypercompact stellar system  Massive compact halo object ( MACHO s)  Weakly interacting massive particles ( WIMP s)   References  "  Category:Star clusters  Category:Open clusters     Moore, B., & Silk, J. 1995, Astrophysical Journal , 442, L5-L8 (ADS entry [ http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ ...442L...5M]) ↩  de la Fuente Marcos, R. 1995, Astronomy and Astrophysics , 301, 407-418 (ADS entry [ http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995A%26A ...301..407D]) ↩  Kerins, E.
