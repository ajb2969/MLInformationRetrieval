Fekete–Szegő inequality

In mathematics, the Fekete–Szegő inequality is an inequality for the coefficients of univalent analytic functions found by , related to the Bieberbach conjecture. Finding similar estimates for other classes of functions is called the Fekete–Szegő problem.
The Fekete–Szegő inequality states that if



is a univalent analytic function on the unit disk and 0 ≤ λ |a_3-\lambda a_2^2|\leq 1+2\exp(-2\lambda /(1-\lambda)).
