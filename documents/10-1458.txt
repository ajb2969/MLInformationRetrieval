   D-glutamate(D-aspartate) oxidase      D-glutamate(D-aspartate) oxidase   In enzymology , a D-glutamate(D-aspartate) oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-glutamate + H 2 O + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-oxoglutarate + NH 3 + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are D-glutamate , H 2 O , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 2-oxoglutarate , NH 3 , and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glutamate(D-aspartate):oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating) . Other names in common use include D-glutamic-aspartic oxidase , and D-monoaminodicarboxylic acid oxidase . This enzyme participates in alanine and aspartate metabolism . It employs one cofactor , FAD .  References     "  Category:EC 1.4.3  Category:Flavin enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
