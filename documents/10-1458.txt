D-glutamate(D-aspartate) oxidase

In enzymology, a D-glutamate(D-aspartate) oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-glutamate + H2O + O2

 
  2-oxoglutarate + NH3 + H2O2


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are D-glutamate, H2O, and O2, whereas its 3 products are 2-oxoglutarate, NH3, and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glutamate(D-aspartate):oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating). Other names in common use include D-glutamic-aspartic oxidase, and D-monoaminodicarboxylic acid oxidase. This enzyme participates in alanine and aspartate metabolism. It employs one cofactor, FAD.
