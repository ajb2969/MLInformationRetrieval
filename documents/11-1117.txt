   Thyroid-hormone transaminase      Thyroid-hormone transaminase   In enzymology , a thyroid-hormone transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine + 2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-[4-(4-hydroxy-3-iodophenoxy)-3,5-diiodophenyl]-2-oxopropanoate + L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine and 2-oxoglutarate , whereas its two products are [[3-[4-(4-hydroxy-3-iodophenoxy)-3,5-diiodophenyl]-2-oxopropanoate]] and L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include 3,5-dinitrotyrosine transaminase , and thyroid hormone aminotransferase . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .
