The graph of a real-valued quadratic function of a real variable x, is a parabola.



A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree two. The general form is



where a â‰  0 (if a = 0, then the equation becomes a linear equation). The letters a, b, and c are called coefficients: the quadratic coefficient a is the coefficient of x2, the linear coefficient b is the coefficient of x, and c is the constant coefficient, also called the free term.
Quadratic equations are called quadratic because quadratus is Latin for "square"; in the leading term the variable is squared.
A quadratic equation has two (not necessarily distinct) solutions, which may be real or complex, given by the quadratic formula:



These solutions are roots of the corresponding quadratic function
