A quadratic equation is a polynomial  equation of degree two. The general form is         a   x  2    +   b  x   +  c   =  0   ,          a   superscript  x  2      b  x   c   0    ax^{2}+bx+c=0,\,\!     where a ≠ 0 (if a = 0, then the equation becomes a linear equation ). The letters a , b , and c are called coefficients : the quadratic coefficient a is the coefficient of x 2 , the linear coefficient b is the coefficient of x , and c is the constant coefficient, also called the free term .  Quadratic equations are called quadratic because quadratus is Latin for "square"; in the leading term the variable is squared .  A quadratic equation has two (not necessarily distinct) solutions, which may be real or complex , given by the quadratic formula :       x  =     -  b   ±     b  2   -   4  a  c       2  a     ,      x     plus-or-minus    b        superscript  b  2     4  a  c        2  a      x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a},     These solutions are roots of the corresponding quadratic function        f   (  x  )    =    a   x  2    +   b  x   +  c    .        f  x       a   superscript  x  2      b  x   c     f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c.\,         ...Archive   Image credit: Enoch Lau ''   Read more...
