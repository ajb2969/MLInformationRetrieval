1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase

In enzymology, a 1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4-phosphate 
 
 
 
  ADP + 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4-phosphate, whereas its two products are ADP and 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol-4-phosphate 5-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include diphosphoinositide kinase, PIP kinase, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate kinase, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, and type I PIP kinase. This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: inositol phosphate metabolism, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton.
Structural studies
