   Conchoid (mathematics)      Conchoid (mathematics)   A conchoid is a curve derived from a fixed point O , another curve, and a length d .  Description  For every line through O that intersects the given curve at A the two points on the line which are d from A are on the conchoid. The conchoid is, therefore, the cissoid of the given curve and a circle of radius d and center O . They are called conchoids because the shape of their outer branches resembles conch shells .  The simplest expression uses polar coordinates with O at the origin. If      r  =   α   (  θ  )        r    α  θ     r=\alpha(\theta)   expresses the given curve, then      r  =    α   (  θ  )    ±  d       r   plus-or-minus    α  θ   d     r=\alpha(\theta)\pm d   expresses the conchoid.  If the curve is a line , then the conchoid is the conchoid of Nicomedes .  For instance, if the curve is the line    x  =  a      x  a    x=a   , then the line's polar form is    r  =   a   cos  θ        r    a    θ      r=\frac{a}{\cos\theta}   and therefore the conchoid can be expressed parametrically as        x  =   a  ±   d   cos  θ      ,   y  =    a   tan  θ    ±   d   sin  θ       .     formulae-sequence    x   plus-or-minus  a    d    θ        y   plus-or-minus    a    θ      d    θ        x=a\pm d\cos\theta,\,y=a\tan\theta\pm d\sin\theta.     A limaçon is a conchoid with a circle as the given curve.  The so-called conchoid of de Sluze and conchoid of Dürer are not actually conchoids. The former is a strict cissoid and the latter a construction more general yet.
