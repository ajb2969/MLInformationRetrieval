<h1>Gamma ray</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Gamma radiation</strong>, also known as <strong>gamma rays,</strong> and denoted by the Greek letter <a href="gamma" title="wikilink">γ</a>, refers to <a href="electromagnetic_radiation" title="wikilink">electromagnetic radiation</a> of an extremely high frequency and therefore consists of high-energy <a href="photon" title="wikilink">photons</a>. Gamma rays are <a href="ionizing_radiation" title="wikilink">ionizing radiation</a>, and are thus biologically hazardous. They are classically produced by the decay of <a href="atomic_nuclei" title="wikilink">atomic nuclei</a> as they transition from a high energy state to a lower state known as <a href="gamma_decay" title="wikilink">gamma decay</a>, but may also be produced by other processes. <a href="Paul_Villard" title="wikilink">Paul Villard</a>, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900, while studying radiation emitted from <a class="uri" href="radium" title="wikilink">radium</a>. Villard's radiation was named "gamma rays" by <a href="Ernest_Rutherford" title="wikilink">Ernest Rutherford</a> in 1903.</p>

<p>Natural sources of gamma rays on Earth include gamma decay from naturally occurring <a href="radioisotope" title="wikilink">radioisotopes</a>, and secondary radiation from atmospheric interactions with <a href="cosmic_ray" title="wikilink">cosmic ray</a> particles. Rare terrestrial natural sources produce gamma rays that are not of a nuclear origin, such as <a href="lightning_strike" title="wikilink">lightning strikes</a> and <a href="terrestrial_gamma-ray_flash" title="wikilink">terrestrial gamma-ray flashes</a>. Additionally, gamma rays are produced by a number of astronomical processes in which very high-energy electrons are produced, that in turn cause secondary gamma rays via <a class="uri" href="bremsstrahlung" title="wikilink">bremsstrahlung</a>, inverse <a href="Compton_scattering" title="wikilink">Compton scattering</a>, and <a href="synchrotron_radiation" title="wikilink">synchrotron radiation</a>. However, a large fraction of such astronomical gamma rays are screened by Earth's atmosphere and can only be detected by spacecraft.</p>

<p>Gamma rays typically have frequencies above 10 <a href="hertz" title="wikilink">exahertz</a> (or &gt;10<sup>19</sup> Hz), and therefore have energies above 100 <a href="electronvolt" title="wikilink">keV</a> and wavelengths less than 10 <a href="picometer" title="wikilink">picometers</a> (10<sup>−12</sup> meter), which is less than the diameter of an <a class="uri" href="atom" title="wikilink">atom</a>. However, this is not a hard and fast definition, but rather only a rule-of-thumb description for natural processes. Electromagnetic radiation from <a href="radioactive_decay" title="wikilink">radioactive decay</a> of atomic nuclei is referred to as "gamma rays" no matter its energy, so that there is no <em>lower</em> limit to gamma energy derived from radioactive decay. This radiation commonly has energy of a few hundred <a class="uri" href="keV" title="wikilink">keV</a>, and almost always less than 10 <a class="uri" href="MeV" title="wikilink">MeV</a>. In astronomy, gamma rays are defined by their energy, and no production process needs to be specified. The energies of gamma rays from astronomical sources range to over 10 TeV, an energy far too large to result from radioactive decay.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> A notable example is extremely powerful bursts of high-energy radiation referred to as long duration <a href="gamma-ray_burst" title="wikilink">gamma-ray bursts</a>, of energies higher than can be produced by radioactive decay. These bursts of gamma rays, thought to be due to the collapse of stars called <a href="hypernova" title="wikilink">hypernovae</a>, are the most powerful events so far discovered in the <a class="uri" href="cosmos" title="wikilink">cosmos</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-discovery">History of discovery</h2>

<p>The first gamma ray source to be discovered historically was the <a href="radioactive_decay" title="wikilink">radioactive decay</a> process called <strong>gamma decay</strong>. In this type of decay, an <a href="excited_state" title="wikilink">excited</a> nucleus emits a gamma ray almost immediately upon formation (it is now understood that a nuclear <a href="isomeric_transition" title="wikilink">isomeric transition</a>, however, can produce inhibited gamma decay with a measurable and much longer half-life). <a href="Paul_Villard" title="wikilink">Paul Villard</a>, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900, while studying radiation emitted from <a class="uri" href="radium" title="wikilink">radium</a>. Villard knew that his described radiation was more powerful than previously described types of rays from radium, which included <a href="beta_ray" title="wikilink">beta rays</a>, first noted as "radioactivity" by <a href="Henri_Becquerel" title="wikilink">Henri Becquerel</a> in 1896, and <a href="alpha_ray" title="wikilink">alpha rays</a>, discovered as a less penetrating form of radiation by Rutherford, in 1899. However, Villard did not consider naming them as a different fundamental type.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Villard's radiation was recognized as being of a type fundamentally different from previously named rays, by <a href="Ernest_Rutherford" title="wikilink">Ernest Rutherford</a>, who in 1903 named Villard's rays "gamma rays" by analogy with the beta and alpha rays that Rutherford had differentiated in 1899.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The "rays" emitted by radioactive elements were named in order of their power to penetrate various materials, using the first three letters of the Greek alphabet: <a href="alpha_ray" title="wikilink">alpha rays</a> as the least penetrating, followed by <a href="beta_ray" title="wikilink">beta rays</a>, followed by gamma rays as the most penetrating. Rutherford also noted that gamma rays were not deflected (or at least, not <em>easily</em> deflected) by a magnetic field, another property making them unlike alpha and beta rays.</p>

<p>Gamma rays were first thought to be particles with mass, like alpha and beta rays. Rutherford initially believed that they might be extremely fast beta particles, but their failure to be deflected by a magnetic field indicated that they had no charge.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 1914, gamma rays were observed to be reflected from crystal surfaces, proving that they were electromagnetic radiation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Rutherford and his coworker <a href="Edward_Andrade" title="wikilink">Edward Andrade</a> measured the wavelengths of gamma rays from radium, and found that they were similar to X-rays, but with shorter wavelengths and (thus) higher frequency. This was eventually recognized as giving them also more energy per <a class="uri" href="photon" title="wikilink">photon</a>, as soon as the latter term became generally accepted. A gamma decay was then understood to usually emit a single gamma photon.</p>

<p><embed src="NASA's Fermi Explores the Early Universe.ogv" title="fig:This animation tracks several gamma rays through space and time, from their emission in the jet of a distant blazar to their arrival in Fermi's Large Area Telescope (LAT)."></embed> Natural sources of gamma rays on Earth include gamma decay from naturally occurring <a href="radioisotope" title="wikilink">radioisotopes</a> such as <a class="uri" href="potassium-40" title="wikilink">potassium-40</a>, and also as a secondary radiation from various atmospheric interactions with <a href="cosmic_ray" title="wikilink">cosmic ray</a> particles. Some rare terrestrial natural sources that produce gamma rays that are not of a nuclear origin, are <a href="lightning_strike" title="wikilink">lightning strikes</a> and <a href="terrestrial_gamma-ray_flash" title="wikilink">terrestrial gamma-ray flashes</a>, which produce high energy emissions from natural high-energy voltages. Gamma rays are produced by a number of astronomical processes in which very high-energy electrons are produced. Such electrons produce secondary gamma rays by the mechanisms of <a class="uri" href="bremsstrahlung" title="wikilink">bremsstrahlung</a>, inverse <a href="Compton_scattering" title="wikilink">Compton scattering</a> and <a href="synchrotron_radiation" title="wikilink">synchrotron radiation</a>. A large fraction of such astronomical gamma rays are screened by Earth's atmosphere and must be detected by spacecraft. Notable artificial sources of gamma rays include <a href="nuclear_fission" title="wikilink">fission</a> such as occurs in <a href="nuclear_reactor" title="wikilink">nuclear reactors</a>, and high energy physics experiments, such as <a href="pion" title="wikilink">neutral pion decay</a> and <a href="nuclear_fusion" title="wikilink">nuclear fusion</a>.</p>
<h2 id="general-characteristics">General characteristics</h2>

<p>The distinction between <a href="X-ray" title="wikilink">X-rays</a> and gamma rays has changed in recent decades. Originally, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by <a href="X-ray_tube" title="wikilink">X-ray tubes</a> almost invariably had a longer <a class="uri" href="wavelength" title="wikilink">wavelength</a> than the radiation (gamma rays) emitted by <a class="uri" href="radioactive" title="wikilink">radioactive</a> <a href="atomic_nucleus" title="wikilink">nuclei</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Older literature distinguished between X- and gamma radiation on the basis of wavelength, with radiation shorter than some arbitrary wavelength, such as 10<sup>−11</sup> m, defined as gamma rays.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> However, with artificial sources now able to duplicate any electromagnetic radiation that originates in the nucleus, as well as far higher energies, the wavelengths characteristic of radioactive gamma ray sources vs. other types, now completely overlap. Thus, gamma rays are now usually distinguished by their origin: <a href="X-ray" title="wikilink">X-rays</a> are emitted by definition by <a href="electron" title="wikilink">electrons</a> outside the nucleus, while gamma rays are emitted by the <a href="nucleus_(atomic_structure)" title="wikilink">nucleus</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Exceptions to this convention occur in astronomy, where gamma decay is seen in the afterglow of certain supernovas, but other high energy processes known to involve other than radioactive decay are still classed as sources of gamma radiation.</p>
<h2 id="naming-conventions-and-overlap-in-terminology">Naming conventions and overlap in terminology</h2>

<p> In the past, the distinction between <a href="X-ray" title="wikilink">X-rays</a> and gamma rays was based on energy, with gamma rays being considered a higher-energy version of electromagnetic radiation. However, modern high-energy X-rays produced by <a href="linear_accelerator" title="wikilink">linear accelerators</a> for <a class="uri" href="megavoltage" title="wikilink">megavoltage</a> treatment in cancer often have higher energy (4 to 25 MeV) than do most classical gamma rays produced by nuclear <a href="gamma_decay" title="wikilink">gamma decay</a>. One of the most common gamma ray emitting isotopes used in diagnostic <a href="nuclear_medicine" title="wikilink">nuclear medicine</a>, <a class="uri" href="technetium-99m" title="wikilink">technetium-99m</a>, produces gamma radiation of the same energy (140 keV) as that produced by diagnostic X-ray machines, but of significantly lower energy than therapeutic <a href="photon" title="wikilink">photons</a> from <a href="linear_particle_accelerator" title="wikilink">linear particle accelerators</a>. In the medical community today, the convention that radiation produced by nuclear decay is the only type referred to as "gamma" radiation is still respected.</p>

<p>Because of this broad overlap in energy ranges, in physics the two types of electromagnetic radiation are now often defined by their origin: X-rays are emitted by electrons (either in orbitals outside of the nucleus, or while being accelerated to produce <a class="uri" href="bremsstrahlung" title="wikilink">bremsstrahlung</a>-type radiation),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> while gamma rays are emitted by the nucleus or by means of other <a href="particle_decay" title="wikilink">particle decays</a> or annihilation events. There is no lower limit to the energy of photons produced by nuclear reactions, and thus <a class="uri" href="ultraviolet" title="wikilink">ultraviolet</a> or lower energy photons produced by these processes would also be defined as "gamma rays".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The only naming-convention that is still universally respected is the rule that electromagnetic radiation that is known to be of atomic nuclear origin is <em>always</em> referred to as "gamma rays," and never as X-rays. However, in physics and astronomy, the converse convention (that all gamma rays are considered to be of nuclear origin) is frequently violated.</p>

<p>In astronomy, higher energy gamma and X-rays are defined by energy, since the processes that produce them may be uncertain and photon energy, not origin, determines the required astronomical detectors needed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> High energy photons occur in nature that are known to be produced by processes other than nuclear decay but are still referred to as gamma radiation. An example is "gamma rays" from lightning discharges at 10 to 20 MeV, and known to be produced by the <a class="uri" href="bremsstrahlung" title="wikilink">bremsstrahlung</a> mechanism.</p>

<p>Another example is <a href="gamma-ray_burst" title="wikilink">gamma-ray bursts</a>, now known to be produced from processes too powerful to involve simple collections of atoms undergoing radioactive decay. This has led to the realization that many gamma rays produced in astronomical processes result not from radioactive decay or particle annihilation, but rather in much the same manner as the production of X-rays. Although gamma rays in astronomy are discussed below as non-radioactive events, in fact a few gamma rays are known in astronomy to originate explicitly from gamma decay of nuclei (as demonstrated by their spectra and emission half life). A classic example is that of supernova <a href="SN_1987A" title="wikilink">SN 1987A</a>, which emits an "afterglow" of gamma-ray photons from the decay of newly made radioactive <a class="uri" href="nickel-56" title="wikilink">nickel-56</a> and <a class="uri" href="cobalt-56" title="wikilink">cobalt-56</a>. Most gamma rays in astronomy, however, arise by other mechanisms. Astronomical literature tends to write "gamma-ray" with a hyphen, by analogy to X-rays, rather than in a way analogous to alpha rays and beta rays. This notation tends to subtly stress the non-nuclear source of most astronomical "gamma-rays".</p>
<h2 id="units-of-measure-and-exposure">Units of measure and exposure</h2>

<p>The measure of gamma rays' <a href="ionization" title="wikilink">ionizing</a> ability is called the exposure:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a class="uri" href="coulomb" title="wikilink">coulomb</a> per kilogram (C/kg) is the <a href="Systeme_International" title="wikilink">SI</a> unit of <a href="ionizing_radiation" title="wikilink">ionizing radiation</a> exposure, and is the amount of radiation required to create 1 coulomb of charge of each polarity in 1 kilogram of matter.</li>
<li>The <a href="Roentgen_(unit)" title="wikilink">röntgen</a> (R) is an obsolete traditional unit of exposure, which represented the amount of radiation required to create 1 <a href="electrostatic_unit" title="wikilink">esu</a> of charge of each polarity in 1 cubic centimeter of dry air. 1 röntgen = 2.58×10<sup>−4</sup> C/kg</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the effect of gamma and other ionizing radiation on living tissue is more closely related to the amount of <a class="uri" href="energy" title="wikilink">energy</a> deposited rather than the <a href="electric_charge" title="wikilink">charge</a>. This is called the <a href="absorbed_dose" title="wikilink">absorbed dose</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="gray_(unit)" title="wikilink">gray</a> (Gy), which has units of (J/kg), is the SI unit of <a href="absorbed_dose" title="wikilink">absorbed dose</a>, and is the amount of radiation required to deposit 1 <a class="uri" href="joule" title="wikilink">joule</a> of energy in 1 kilogram of any kind of matter.</li>
<li>The <a href="rad_(unit)" title="wikilink">rad</a> is the deprecated <a class="uri" href="CGS" title="wikilink">CGS</a> unit, equal to 0.01 J deposited per kg. 100 rad = 1 Gy.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="equivalent_dose" title="wikilink">equivalent dose</a> is the measure of the biological effect of radiation on human tissue. For gamma rays, it is equal to the <a href="absorbed_dose" title="wikilink">absorbed dose</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a class="uri" href="sievert" title="wikilink">sievert</a> (Sv) is the SI unit of equivalent dose, which for gamma rays is numerically equal to the <a href="Gray_(unit)" title="wikilink">gray</a> (Gy).</li>
<li>The <a href="Röntgen_equivalent_man" title="wikilink">rem</a> is the deprecated <a class="uri" href="CGS" title="wikilink">CGS</a> unit of equivalent dose. For gamma rays it is equal to the <a href="rad_(unit)" title="wikilink">rad</a> or 0.01 J of energy deposited per kg. 1 Sv = 100 rem.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<h3 id="shielding">Shielding</h3>

<p>Shielding from gamma rays requires large amounts of mass, in contrast to <a href="alpha_particle" title="wikilink">alpha particles</a>, which can be blocked by paper or skin, and <a href="beta_particle" title="wikilink">beta particles</a>, which can be shielded by foil. Gamma rays are better absorbed by materials with high <a href="atomic_number" title="wikilink">atomic numbers</a> and high density, although neither effect is important compared to the total mass per area in the path of the gamma ray. For this reason, a lead shield is only modestly better (20–30% better) as a gamma shield than an equal mass of another shielding material, such as aluminium, concrete, water or soil; lead's major advantage is not in lower weight, but rather its compactness due to its higher density. Protective clothing, goggles and respirators can protect from internal contact with or ingestion of alpha or beta emitting particles, but provide no protection from gamma radiation from external sources.</p>

<p>The higher the energy of the gamma rays, the thicker the shielding made from the same shielding material is required. Materials for shielding gamma rays are typically measured by the thickness required to reduce the intensity of the gamma rays by one half (the <a href="half_value_layer" title="wikilink">half value layer</a> or HVL). For example, gamma rays that require  (0.4″) of <a class="uri" href="lead" title="wikilink">lead</a> to reduce their intensity by 50% will also have their intensity reduced in half by  of <a class="uri" href="granite" title="wikilink">granite</a> rock, 6 cm (2½″) of <a class="uri" href="concrete" title="wikilink">concrete</a>, or 9 cm (3½″) of packed <a class="uri" href="soil" title="wikilink">soil</a>. However, the mass of this much concrete or soil is only 20–30% greater than that of lead with the same absorption capability. <a href="Depleted_uranium" title="wikilink">Depleted uranium</a> is used for shielding in <a href="industrial_radiography#Sources" title="wikilink">portable gamma ray sources</a>, but here the savings in weight over lead are larger, as portable <a href="industrial_radiography#Radiographic_cameras" title="wikilink">sources' shape</a> resembles a sphere to some extent, and the volume of a sphere is dependent on the cube of the radius; so a source with its radius cut in half will have its volume reduced by an eighth, which will more than compensate uranium's greater density (as well as reducing bulk). In a nuclear power plant, shielding can be provided by steel and concrete in the pressure and particle containment vessel, while water provides a radiation shielding of fuel rods during storage or transport into the reactor core. The loss of water or removal of a "hot" fuel assembly into the air would result in much higher radiation levels than when kept under water.</p>
<h3 id="matter-interaction">Matter interaction</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>When a gamma ray passes through matter, the probability for absorption is proportional to the thickness of the layer, the density of the material, and the absorption cross section of the material. The total absorption shows an <a href="exponential_decay" title="wikilink">exponential decrease</a> of intensity with distance from the incident surface:</p>

<p>where x is the thickness of the material from the incident surface, μ = <em>n</em>σ is the absorption coefficient, measured in cm<sup>−1</sup>, <em>n</em> the number of atoms per cm<sup>3</sup> of the material (atomic density) and σ the absorption <a href="cross_section_(physics)" title="wikilink">cross section</a> in cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>As it passes through matter, gamma radiation ionizes via three processes: the <a href="photoelectric_effect" title="wikilink">photoelectric effect</a>, <a href="Compton_scattering" title="wikilink">Compton scattering</a>, and <a href="pair_production" title="wikilink">pair production</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="Photoelectric_effect" title="wikilink">Photoelectric effect</a></strong>: This describes the case in which a gamma <a class="uri" href="photon" title="wikilink">photon</a> interacts with and transfers its energy to an atomic electron, causing the ejection of that electron from the atom. The kinetic energy of the resulting <a class="uri" href="photoelectron" title="wikilink">photoelectron</a> is equal to the energy of the incident gamma photon minus the energy that originally bound the electron to the atom (binding energy). The photoelectric effect is the dominant energy transfer mechanism for X-ray and gamma ray photons with energies below 50 keV (thousand <a href="electronvolt" title="wikilink">electron volts</a>), but it is much less important at higher energies.</li>
<li><strong><a href="Compton_scattering" title="wikilink">Compton scattering</a></strong>: This is an interaction in which an incident gamma photon loses enough energy to an atomic electron to cause its ejection, with the remainder of the original photon's energy emitted as a new, lower energy gamma photon whose emission direction is different from that of the incident gamma photon, hence the term "scattering". The probability of Compton scattering decreases with increasing photon energy. Compton scattering is thought to be the principal absorption mechanism for gamma rays in the intermediate energy range 100 <a href="electronvolt" title="wikilink">keV</a> to 10 MeV. Compton scattering is relatively independent of the <a href="atomic_number" title="wikilink">atomic number</a> of the absorbing material, which is why very dense materials like lead are only modestly better shields, on a <em>per weight</em> basis, than are less dense materials.</li>
<li><strong><a href="Pair_production" title="wikilink">Pair production</a></strong>: This becomes possible with gamma energies exceeding 1.02 MeV, and becomes important as an absorption mechanism at energies over 5 MeV (see illustration at right, for lead). By interaction with the <a href="electric_field" title="wikilink">electric field</a> of a nucleus, the energy of the incident photon is converted into the mass of an electron-<a class="uri" href="positron" title="wikilink">positron</a> pair. Any gamma energy in excess of the equivalent rest mass of the two particles (totaling at least 1.02 MeV) appears as the kinetic energy of the pair and in the recoil of the emitting nucleus. At the end of the positron's <a href="range_(particle_radiation)" title="wikilink">range</a>, it combines with a free electron, and the two annihilate, and the entire mass of these two is then converted into two gamma photons of at least 0.51 MeV energy each (or higher according to the kinetic energy of the annihilated particles).</li>
</ul>

<p>The secondary electrons (and/or positrons) produced in any of these three processes frequently have enough energy to produce much <a class="uri" href="ionization" title="wikilink">ionization</a> themselves.</p>

<p>Additionally, gamma rays, particularly high energy ones, can interact with atomic nuclei resulting in ejection of particles in <a class="uri" href="photodisintegration" title="wikilink">photodisintegration</a>, or in some cases, even nuclear fission (<a class="uri" href="photofission" title="wikilink">photofission</a>).</p>
<h3 id="light-interaction">Light interaction</h3>

<p>High-energy (from 80 GeV to ~10 <a href="electronvolt" title="wikilink">TeV</a>) gamma rays arriving from far-distant <a href="quasar" title="wikilink">quasars</a> are used to estimate the <a href="extragalactic_background_light" title="wikilink">extragalactic background light</a> in the universe: The highest-energy rays interact more readily with the background light <a href="photon" title="wikilink">photons</a> and thus the density of the background light may be estimated by analyzing the incoming gamma ray spectra.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="gamma-ray-production">Gamma ray production</h3>

<p>Gamma rays can be produced by a wide range of phenomena, both nuclear and non-nuclear.</p>
<h4 id="radioactive-decay-gamma-decay">Radioactive decay (gamma decay)</h4>

<p>Gamma rays are produced during gamma decay, which normally occurs after other forms of decay occur, such as <a href="alpha_decay" title="wikilink">alpha</a> or <a href="beta_decay" title="wikilink">beta</a> decay. An excited nucleus can decay by the emission of an  or  particle. The <a href="daughter_nucleus" title="wikilink">daughter nucleus</a> that results is usually left in an excited state. It can then decay to a lower energy state by emitting a gamma ray photon, in a process called gamma decay.</p>

<p>The emission of a gamma ray from an excited nucleus typically, requires only 10<sup>−12</sup> seconds, and is thus nearly instantaneous. Gamma decay may also follow <a href="nuclear_reaction" title="wikilink">nuclear reactions</a> such as <a href="neutron_capture" title="wikilink">neutron capture</a>, <a href="nuclear_fission" title="wikilink">nuclear fission</a>, or <a href="nuclear_fusion" title="wikilink">nuclear fusion</a>. Gamma decay is also a mode of relaxation of many excited states of atomic nuclei following other types of radioactive decay, such as <a href="beta_decay" title="wikilink">beta decay</a>, so long as these states possess the necessary component of nuclear <a href="spin_(physics)" title="wikilink">spin</a>. When high-energy gamma rays, electrons, or protons bombard materials, the excited atoms emit characteristic "secondary" gamma rays, which are products of the creation of excited nuclear states in the bombarded atoms. Such transitions, a form of nuclear gamma <a class="uri" href="fluorescence" title="wikilink">fluorescence</a>, form a topic in <a href="nuclear_physics" title="wikilink">nuclear physics</a> called <a href="gamma_spectroscopy" title="wikilink">gamma spectroscopy</a>). Formation of fluorescent gamma rays are a rapid subtype of radioactive gamma decay.</p>

<p>In certain cases, the excited nuclear state that follows the emission of a beta particle or other type of excitation, may be more stable than average, and is termed a <a href="metastability#Atomic_and_nuclear_physics" title="wikilink">metastable</a> excited state, if its decay takes (at least) 100 to 1000 times longer than the average 10<sup>−12</sup> seconds. Such relatively long-lived excited nuclei are termed <a href="nuclear_isomer" title="wikilink">nuclear isomers</a>, and their decays are termed <a href="isomeric_transition" title="wikilink">isomeric transitions</a>. Such nuclei have <a href="half-life" title="wikilink">half-lifes</a> that are more easily measurable, and rare nuclear isomers are able to stay in their excited state for minutes, hours, days, or occasionally far longer, before emitting a gamma ray. The process of isomeric transition is therefore similar to any gamma emission, but differs in that it involves the intermediate metastable excited state(s) of the nuclei. Metastable states are often characterized by high <a href="nuclear_spin" title="wikilink">nuclear spin</a>, requiring a change in spin of several units or more with gamma decay, instead of a single unit transition that occurs in only 10<sup>−12</sup> seconds. The rate of gamma decay is also slowed when the energy of excitation of the nucleus is small.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>An emitted gamma ray from any type of excited state may transfer its energy directly to any <a href="electron" title="wikilink">electrons</a>, but most probably to one of the K shell electrons of the atom, causing it to be ejected from that atom, in a process generally termed the <a href="photoelectric_effect" title="wikilink">photoelectric effect</a> (external gamma rays and ultraviolet rays may also cause this effect). The photoelectric effect should not be confused with the <a href="internal_conversion" title="wikilink">internal conversion</a> process, in which a gamma ray photon is not produced as an intermediate particle (rather, a "virtual gamma ray" may be thought to mediate the process).</p>

<p> Gamma rays, X-rays, visible <a class="uri" href="light" title="wikilink">light</a>, and radio waves are all forms of <a href="electromagnetic_radiation" title="wikilink">electromagnetic radiation</a>. The only difference is the <a class="uri" href="frequency" title="wikilink">frequency</a> and hence the <a class="uri" href="energy" title="wikilink">energy</a> of those <a href="photon" title="wikilink">photons</a>. Gamma rays are generally the most energetic of these, although a broad overlap with <a class="uri" href="X-ray" title="wikilink">X-ray</a> energies occurs. An example of gamma ray production follows:</p>

<p>First  decays to <a href="excited_state" title="wikilink">excited</a>  by <a href="beta_rays" title="wikilink">beta decay</a> emission of an electron of 0.31 MeV. Then the excited  decays to the ground state (see <a href="nuclear_shell_model" title="wikilink">nuclear shell model</a>) by emitting gamma rays in succession of 1.17 MeV followed by 1.33 MeV. This path is followed 99.88% of the time:</p>

<p>Another example is the alpha decay of  to form ; which is followed by <a class="uri" href="gamma" title="wikilink">gamma</a> emission. In some cases, the gamma emission spectrum of the daughter nucleus is quite simple, (e.g. /) while in other cases, such as with (/ and /), the gamma emission spectrum is complex, revealing that a series of nuclear energy levels exist.</p>

<p>Because a beta decay is accompanied by the emission of a <a class="uri" href="neutrino" title="wikilink">neutrino</a> that also carries a varying amount of energy away, the beta emission spectrum does not have sharp lines, but instead is broad. Hence, it is not possible to describe the different energy levels found in the nucleus using beta decay energies alone.</p>

<p><a href="Gamma_spectroscopy" title="wikilink">Gamma spectroscopy</a> is the study of the energetic transitions in atomic nuclei, which are generally associated with the absorption or emission of gamma rays. As in optical <a class="uri" href="spectroscopy" title="wikilink">spectroscopy</a> (see <a href="Franck-Condon_Principle" title="wikilink">Franck Condon</a> effect) the absorption of gamma rays by a nucleus is especially likely (i.e., peaks in a "resonance") when the energy of the gamma ray is the same as that of an energy transition in the nucleus. In the case of gamma rays, such a resonance is seen in the technique of <a href="Mössbauer_spectroscopy" title="wikilink">Mössbauer spectroscopy</a>. In the <a href="Mössbauer_effect" title="wikilink">Mössbauer effect</a> the narrow resonance absorption for nuclear gamma absorption can be successfully attained by physically immobilizing atomic nuclei in a crystal. The immobilization of nuclei at both ends of a gamma resonance interaction is required so that no gamma energy is lost to the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the emitting or absorbing end of a gamma transition. Such loss of energy causes gamma ray resonance absorption to fail. However, when emitted gamma rays carry essentially all of the energy of the atomic nuclear de-excitation that produces them, this energy is also sufficient to excite the same energy state in a second immobilized nucleus of the same type.</p>
<h4 id="gamma-rays-from-sources-other-than-radioactive-decay">Gamma rays from sources other than radioactive decay</h4>

<p>A few gamma rays in astronomy are known to arise from gamma decay (see discussion of <a class="uri" href="SN1987A" title="wikilink">SN1987A</a>) but most do not.</p>

<p>Photons from astrophysical sources that carry energy in the gamma radiation range are often explicitly called gamma-radiation. In addition to nuclear emissions, they are often produced by sub-atomic particle and particle-photon interactions. Those include <a href="electron-positron_annihilation" title="wikilink">electron-positron annihilation</a>, <a href="neutral_pion_decay" title="wikilink">neutral pion decay</a>, <a class="uri" href="bremsstrahlung" title="wikilink">bremsstrahlung</a>, inverse <a href="Compton_scattering" title="wikilink">Compton scattering</a>, and <a href="synchrotron_radiation" title="wikilink">synchrotron radiation</a>. <embed src="Antimatter Explosions.ogv" title="fig:The red dots show some of the ~500 terrestrial gamma-ray flashes daily detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope through 2010. Credit: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center."></embed></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terrestrial thunderstorms:</strong> Thunderstorms can produce a brief pulse of gamma radiation called a <a href="terrestrial_gamma-ray_flash" title="wikilink">terrestrial gamma-ray flash</a>. These gamma rays are thought to be produced by high intensity static electric fields accelerating electrons, which then produce gamma rays by <a class="uri" href="bremsstrahlung" title="wikilink">bremsstrahlung</a> as they collide with and are slowed by atoms in the atmosphere. Gamma rays up to 100 MeV can be emitted by terrestrial thunderstorms, and were discovered by space-borne observatories. This raises the possibility of health risks to passengers and crew on aircraft flying in or near thunderclouds.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Extraterrestrial, high energy gamma rays include the gamma ray background produced when <a href="cosmic_ray" title="wikilink">cosmic rays</a> (either high speed electrons or protons) collide with ordinary matter, producing pair-production gamma rays at 511 keV. Alternatively, <a class="uri" href="bremsstrahlung" title="wikilink">bremsstrahlung</a> are produced at energies of tens of MeV or more when cosmic ray electrons interact with nuclei of sufficiently high atomic number (see gamma ray image of the Moon at the beginning of this article, for illustration). </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pulsars and magnetars:</strong> The gamma ray sky (see illustration at right) is dominated by the more common and longer-term production of gamma rays that emanate from <a href="pulsar" title="wikilink">pulsars</a> within the Milky Way. Sources from the rest of the sky are mostly <a href="quasar" title="wikilink">quasars</a>. Pulsars are thought to be neutron stars with magnetic fields that produce focused beams of radiation, and are far less energetic, more common, and much nearer sources (typically seen only in our own galaxy) than are <a href="quasar" title="wikilink">quasars</a> or the rarer <a href="gamma-ray_burst" title="wikilink">gamma-ray burst</a> sources of gamma rays. Pulsars have relatively long-lived magnetic fields that produce focused beams of relativistic speed charged particles, which emit gamma rays (bremsstrahlung) when those strike gas or dust in their nearby medium, and are decelerated. This is a similar mechanism to the production of high energy photons in <a class="uri" href="megavoltage" title="wikilink">megavoltage</a> <a href="radiation_therapy" title="wikilink">radiation therapy</a> machines (see <a class="uri" href="bremsstrahlung" title="wikilink">bremsstrahlung</a>). The "inverse <a href="Compton_effect" title="wikilink">Compton effect</a>", in which charged particles (usually electrons) impart energy to low-energy photons boosting them to higher energy photons. Such impacts of photons on relativistic charged particle beams is another possible mechanism of gamma ray production. Neutron stars with a very high magnetic field (<a href="magnetar" title="wikilink">magnetars</a>), thought to produce astronomical <a href="soft_gamma_repeater" title="wikilink">soft gamma repeaters</a>, are another relatively long-lived star-powered source of gamma radiation.</li>
<li><strong>Quasars and active galaxies:</strong> More powerful gamma rays from very distant <a href="quasar" title="wikilink">quasars</a> and closer active galaxies are thought to have a gamma ray production source similar to a <a href="particle_accelerator" title="wikilink">particle accelerator</a>. High energy electrons produced by the quasar, and subjected to inverse Compton scattering, <a href="synchrotron_radiation" title="wikilink">synchrotron radiation</a>, or bremsstrahlung, are the likely source of the gamma rays from those objects. It is thought that as a <a href="supermassive_black_hole" title="wikilink">supermassive black hole</a> at the center of such galaxies provide the power source that intermittently destroys stars and focuses the resulting charged particles into beams that emerge from their rotational poles. When those beams interact with gas, dust, and lower energy photons they produce X-rays and gamma rays. These sources are known to fluctuate with durations of a few weeks, suggesting their relatively small size (less than a few light-weeks across). Such sources of gamma and X-rays are the most commonly visible high intensity sources outside our galaxy. They shine not in bursts (see illustration), but relatively continuously when viewed with gamma ray telescopes. The power of a typical quasar is about 10<sup>40</sup> watts, a small fraction of which is gamma radiation. Much of the rest is emitted as electromagnetic waves of all frequencies, including radio waves.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Gamma-ray bursts:</strong> The most intense sources of gamma rays, are also the most intense sources of any type of electromagnetic radiation presently known. They are the "long duration burst" sources of gamma rays in astronomy ("long" in this context, meaning a few tens of seconds), and they are rare compared with the sources discussed above. By contrast, "short" <a href="gamma-ray_burst" title="wikilink">gamma-ray bursts</a>, which are not associated with supernovae, are thought to produce gamma rays during the collision of pairs of neutron stars, or a neutron star and a <a href="black_hole" title="wikilink">black hole</a>. Such bursts last two seconds or less, and are of far lower energy than the "long" bursts (only sources in our galaxy are detectable for that reason).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>The so-called <em>long-duration</em> gamma-ray bursts produce a total energy output of about 10<sup>44</sup> joules (as much energy as our <a class="uri" href="Sun" title="wikilink">Sun</a> will produce in its entire life-time) but in a period of only 20 to 40 seconds. Gamma rays are approximately 50% of the total energy output. The leading hypotheses for the mechanism of production of these highest-known intensity beams of radiation, are inverse <a href="Compton_scattering" title="wikilink">Compton scattering</a> and <a href="synchrotron_radiation" title="wikilink">synchrotron radiation</a> from high-energy charged particles. These processes occur as relativistic charged particles leave the region of the event horizon of a newly formed <a href="black_hole" title="wikilink">black hole</a> created during supernova explosion. The beam of particles moving at relativistic speeds are focused for a few tens of seconds by the magnetic field of the exploding <a class="uri" href="hypernova" title="wikilink">hypernova</a>. The fusion explosion of the hypernova drives the energetics of the process. If the narrowly directed beam happens to be pointed toward the Earth, it shines at gamma ray frequencies with such intensity, that it can be detected even at distances of up to 10 billion light years, which is close to the edge of the <a href="visible_universe" title="wikilink">visible universe</a>.</p>
<h2 id="health-effects">Health effects</h2>

<p>Gamma rays cause damage at a cellular level and are penetrating, causing diffuse damage throughout the body. However, they are less ionising than alpha or beta particles, which are less penetrating.</p>

<p>Low levels of gamma rays cause a <a class="uri" href="stochastic" title="wikilink">stochastic</a> health risk, which for radiation dose assessment is defined as the <em>probability</em> of cancer induction and genetic damage.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> High doses produce <a class="uri" href="deterministic" title="wikilink">deterministic</a> effects, which is the <em>severity</em> of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen. These effects are compared to the physical quantity <a href="absorbed_dose" title="wikilink">absorbed dose</a> measured by the unit <a href="Gray_(unit)" title="wikilink">gray</a> (Gy).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="uses">Uses</h2>

<p> Gamma rays provide information about some of the most energetic phenomena in the universe; however, they are largely absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. Instruments aboard high-altitude balloons and satellites missions, such as the <a href="Fermi_Gamma-ray_Space_Telescope" title="wikilink">Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope</a>, provide our only view of the universe in gamma rays.</p>

<p>Gamma-induced molecular changes can also be used to alter the properties of <a href="semi-precious_stone" title="wikilink">semi-precious stones</a>, and is often used to change white <a class="uri" href="topaz" title="wikilink">topaz</a> into <a href="blue_topaz" title="wikilink">blue topaz</a>.</p>

<p>Non-contact industrial sensors commonly use sources of gamma radiation in the refining, mining, chemical, food, soaps and detergents, and pulp and paper industries, for the measurement of levels, density, and thicknesses. Typically, these use Co-60 or Cs-137 isotopes as the radiation source.</p>

<p>In the US, gamma ray detectors are beginning to be used as part of the <a href="Container_Security_Initiative" title="wikilink">Container Security Initiative</a> (CSI). These machines are advertised to be able to scan 30 containers per hour.</p>

<p>Gamma radiation is often used to kill living organisms, in a process called <a class="uri" href="irradiation" title="wikilink">irradiation</a>. Applications of this include the sterilization of medical equipment (as an alternative to <a href="autoclave" title="wikilink">autoclaves</a> or chemical means), the removal of decay-causing <a class="uri" href="bacteria" title="wikilink">bacteria</a> from many foods and the prevention of the sprouting of fruit and vegetables to maintain freshness and flavor.</p>

<p>Despite their cancer-causing properties, gamma rays are also used to treat some types of <a class="uri" href="cancer" title="wikilink">cancer</a>, since the rays kill cancer cells also. In the procedure called <a href="gamma_knife" title="wikilink">gamma-knife</a> surgery, multiple concentrated beams of gamma rays are directed to the growth in order to kill the cancerous cells. The beams are aimed from different angles to concentrate the radiation on the growth while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues.</p>

<p>Gamma rays are also used for diagnostic purposes in <a href="nuclear_medicine" title="wikilink">nuclear medicine</a> in imaging techniques. A number of different gamma-emitting <a href="radioisotope" title="wikilink">radioisotopes</a> are used. For example, in a <a href="PET_scan" title="wikilink">PET scan</a> a radiolabeled sugar called <a class="uri" href="fludeoxyglucose" title="wikilink">fludeoxyglucose</a> emits <a href="positron" title="wikilink">positrons</a> that are annihilated by electrons, producing pairs of gamma rays that highlight cancer as the cancer often has a higher metabolic rate than the surrounding tissues. The most common gamma emitter used in medical applications is the <a href="nuclear_isomer" title="wikilink">nuclear isomer</a> <a class="uri" href="technetium-99m" title="wikilink">technetium-99m</a> which emits gamma rays in the same energy range as diagnostic X-rays. When this radionuclide tracer is administered to a patient, a <a href="gamma_camera" title="wikilink">gamma camera</a> can be used to form an image of the radioisotope's distribution by detecting the gamma radiation emitted (see also <a class="uri" href="SPECT" title="wikilink">SPECT</a>). Depending on which molecule has been labeled with the tracer, such techniques can be employed to diagnose a wide range of conditions (for example, the spread of cancer to the bones via <a href="bone_scan" title="wikilink">bone scan</a>).</p>
<h3 id="body-response">Body response</h3>

<p>When gamma radiation breaks DNA molecules, a cell may be able to <a href="DNA_repair#DNA_repair_mechanisms" title="wikilink">repair the damaged</a> genetic material, within limits. However, a study of Rothkamm and Lobrich has shown that this repair process works well after high-dose exposure but is much slower than in the case of a low-dose exposure.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="risk-assessment">Risk assessment</h3>

<p>The natural outdoor exposure in <a href="Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Great Britain</a> ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 µSv/h with significant increase around known nuclear and contaminated sites.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Natural exposure to gamma rays is about 1 to 2 mSv per year, and the average total amount of radiation received in one year per inhabitant in the USA is 3.6 mSv.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> There is a small increase in the dose, due to naturally occurring gamma radiation, around small particles of high atomic number materials in the human body caused by the <a href="photoelectric_effect" title="wikilink">photoelectric effect</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>By comparison, the radiation dose from chest <a class="uri" href="radiography" title="wikilink">radiography</a> (about 0.06 mSv) is a fraction of the annual naturally occurring background radiation dose.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> A chest CT delivers 5 to 8 mSv. A whole-body <a href="positron_emission_tomography" title="wikilink">PET</a>/CT scan can deliver 14 to 32 mSv depending on the protocol.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The dose from <a class="uri" href="fluoroscopy" title="wikilink">fluoroscopy</a> of the stomach is much higher, approximately 50 mSv (14 times the annual yearly background).</p>

<p>An acute full-body equivalent single exposure dose of 1 Sv (1000 mSv) causes slight blood changes, but 2.0–3.5 Sv (2.0–3.5 Gy) causes very severe syndrome of nausea, hair loss, and <a class="uri" href="hemorrhaging" title="wikilink">hemorrhaging</a>, and will cause death in a sizable number of cases—-about 10% to 35% without medical treatment. A dose of 5 Sv<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> (5 Gy) is considered approximately the <a href="median_lethal_dose" title="wikilink">LD<sub>50</sub></a> (lethal dose for 50% of exposed population) for an acute exposure to radiation even with standard medical treatment. A dose higher than 5 Sv (5 Gy) brings an increasing chance of death above 50%. Above 7.5–10 Sv (7.5–10 Gy) to the entire body, even extraordinary treatment, such as bone-marrow transplants, will not prevent the death of the individual exposed (see <em><a href="Radiation_poisoning" title="wikilink">Radiation poisoning</a></em>). (Doses much larger than this may, however, be delivered to selected parts of the body in the course of <a href="radiation_therapy" title="wikilink">radiation therapy</a>.)</p>

<p>For low dose exposure, for example among nuclear workers, who receive an average yearly radiation dose of 19 mSv, the risk of dying from cancer (excluding <a class="uri" href="leukemia" title="wikilink">leukemia</a>) increases by 2 percent. For a dose of 100 mSv, the risk increase is 10 percent. By comparison, risk of dying from cancer was increased by 32 percent for the survivors of the <a href="atomic_bombing_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki" title="wikilink">atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
