   The Smithers Divide      The Smithers Divide   (Figure)  A plot demonstrating The Smithers Divide, created using scipy and matplotlib.   In Binary Systems containing one or more planets, if      ϕ   P  a  S  a    ϵ   <  0.75         subscript  ϕ    P  a  S  a    ϵ   0.75    \frac{\phi_{PaSa}}{\epsilon}<0.75   , the planet's orbit is almost always unstable, where    ϕ   P  a  S  a      subscript  ϕ    P  a  S  a     \phi_{PaSa}   is the ratio of planetary semi-major axis to stellar semi-major axis, and   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   is the stellar orbital eccentricity . However, when     ϕ  ϵ   =  0.25        ϕ  ϵ   0.25    \frac{\phi}{\epsilon}=0.25   , the planetary orbits appear to be stable. The Smithers Divide is this phenomenon, and is currently a topic of ongoing research at the University of California, Santa Cruz . It is named after Benjamin Smithers, a student at the University of California, Santa Cruz , California, United States. 1  References  External links   Github.com  Smithers, et al. March 2015.
