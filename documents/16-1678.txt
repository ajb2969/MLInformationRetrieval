In Binary Systems containing one or more planets, if 
 
 
 
 , the planet's orbit is almost always unstable, where 
 
 
 
  is the ratio of planetary semi-major axis to stellar semi-major axis, and 
 
 
 
  is the stellar orbital eccentricity. However, when 
 
 
 
 , the planetary orbits appear to be stable. The Smithers Divide is this phenomenon, and is currently a topic of ongoing research at the University of California, Santa Cruz. It is named after Benjamin Smithers, a student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, California, United States.1
