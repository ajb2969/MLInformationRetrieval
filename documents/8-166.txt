Poisson random measure

Let 
 
 
 
  be some measure space with 
 
 
 
 -finite measure

 
 . The Poisson random measure with intensity measure

 
  is a family of random variables

 
  defined on some probability space

 
  such that
i) 
 
 
 
  is a Poisson random variable with rate 
 
 
 
 .
ii) If sets 
 
 
 
  don't intersect then the corresponding random variables from i) are mutually independent.
iii) 
 
 
 
  is a measure on 
 
 

Existence
If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  satisfies the conditions i)–iii). Otherwise, in the case of finite measure

 
 , given 
 
 
 
 , a Poisson random variable with rate 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , mutually independent random variables with distribution

 
 , define 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a degenerate measure located in 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  will be a Poisson random measure. In the case 
 
 
 
  is not finite the measure

 
  can be obtained from the measures constructed above on parts of 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is finite.
Applications
This kind of random measure is often used when describing jumps of stochastic processes, in particular in Lévy–Itō decomposition of the Lévy processes.
