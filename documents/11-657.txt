   6-aminohexanoate-dimer hydrolase      6-aminohexanoate-dimer hydrolase   In enzymology , a 6-aminohexanoate-dimer hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-(6-aminohexanoyl)-6-aminohexanoate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 6-aminohexanoate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-(6-aminohexanoyl)-6-aminohexanoate and H 2 O , whereas its product is 6-aminohexanoate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-(6-aminohexanoyl)-6-aminohexanoate amidohydrolase . This enzyme is also called 6-aminohexanoic acid oligomer hydrolase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
