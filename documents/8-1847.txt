   Divided power structure      Divided power structure   In mathematics , specifically commutative algebra , a divided power structure is a way of making expressions of the form     x  n   /   n  !        superscript  x  n     n     x^{n}/n!   meaningful even when it is not possible to actually divide by    n  !      n    n!   .  Definition  Let A be a commutative ring with an ideal  I . A divided power structure (or PD-structure , after the French puissances divisées ) on I is a collection of maps     γ  n   :   I  →  A      normal-:   subscript  γ  n    normal-→  I  A     \gamma_{n}:I\to A   for n =0, 1, 2, ... such that:         γ  0    (  x  )    =  1         subscript  γ  0   x   1    \gamma_{0}(x)=1   and      γ  1    (  x  )    =  x         subscript  γ  1   x   x    \gamma_{1}(x)=x   for    x  ∈  I      x  I    x\in I   , while      γ  n    (  x  )    ∈  I         subscript  γ  n   x   I    \gamma_{n}(x)\in I   for n > 0.        γ  n    (   x  +  y   )    =    ∑   i  =  0   n     γ   n  -  i     (  x  )    γ  i    (  y  )            subscript  γ  n     x  y      superscript   subscript     i  0    n      subscript  γ    n  i    x   subscript  γ  i   y      \gamma_{n}(x+y)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\gamma_{n-i}(x)\gamma_{i}(y)   for     x  ,  y   ∈  I       x  y   I    x,y\in I   .        γ  n    (   λ  x   )    =    λ  n    γ  n    (  x  )           subscript  γ  n     λ  x       superscript  λ  n    subscript  γ  n   x     \gamma_{n}(\lambda x)=\lambda^{n}\gamma_{n}(x)   for     λ  ∈  A   ,   x  ∈  I      formulae-sequence    λ  A     x  I     \lambda\in A,x\in I   .        γ  m    (  x  )    γ  n    (  x  )    =    (   (  m  ,  n  )   )    γ   m  +  n     (  x  )           subscript  γ  m   x   subscript  γ  n   x      m  n    subscript  γ    m  n    x     \gamma_{m}(x)\gamma_{n}(x)=((m,n))\gamma_{m+n}(x)   for    x  ∈  I      x  I    x\in I   , where     (   (  m  ,  n  )   )   =     (   m  +  n   )   !     m  !    n  !          m  n         m  n        m     n       ((m,n))=\frac{(m+n)!}{m!n!}   is an integer.        γ  n    (    γ  m    (  x  )    )    =    C   n  ,  m     γ   m  n     (  x  )           subscript  γ  n      subscript  γ  m   x       subscript  C   n  m     subscript  γ    m  n    x     \gamma_{n}(\gamma_{m}(x))=C_{n,m}\gamma_{mn}(x)   for    x  ∈  I      x  I    x\in I   , where     C   n  ,  m    =     (   m  n   )   !      (   m  !   )   n    n  !          subscript  C   n  m          m  n       superscript    m   n     n       C_{n,m}=\frac{(mn)!}{(m!)^{n}n!}   is an integer.   For convenience of notation,     γ  n    (  x  )        subscript  γ  n   x    \gamma_{n}(x)   is often written as    x   [  n  ]      superscript  x   delimited-[]  n     x^{[n]}   when it is clear what divided power structure is meant.  The term divided power ideal refers to an ideal with a given divided power structure, and divided power ring refers to a ring with a given ideal with divided power structure.  Homomorphisms of divided power algebras are ring homomorphisms that respects the divided power structure on its source and target.  Examples        ℤ   ⟨  x  ⟩    :=   ℤ   [  x  ,    x  2   2   ,  …  ,    x  n    n  !    ,  …  ]    ⊂   ℚ   [  x  ]         assign    ℤ   delimited-⟨⟩  x      ℤ   x     superscript  x  2   2   normal-…     superscript  x  n     n    normal-…           ℚ   delimited-[]  x       \mathbb{Z}\langle{x}\rangle:=\mathbb{Z}[x,\frac{x^{2}}{2},\ldots,\frac{x^{n}}{%
 n!},\ldots]\subset\mathbb{Q}[x]   is a divided power algebra, it is the free divided power algebra over   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   on one generator.    If A is an algebra over the rational numbers Q , then every ideal I has a unique divided power structure where      γ  n    (  x  )    =    1   n  !    ⋅   x  n           subscript  γ  n   x    normal-⋅    1    n     superscript  x  n      \gamma_{n}(x)=\frac{1}{n!}\cdot x^{n}   . (The uniqueness follows from the easily verified fact that in general,     x  n   =    n  !    γ  n    (  x  )         superscript  x  n       n    subscript  γ  n   x     x^{n}=n!\gamma_{n}(x)   .) Indeed, this is the example which motivates the definition in the first place.    If A is a ring of characteristic     p  >  0      p  0    p>0   , where p is prime, and I is an ideal such that     I  p   =  0       superscript  I  p   0    I^{p}=0   , then we can define a divided power structure on I where      γ  n    (  x  )    =    1   n  !     x  n           subscript  γ  n   x       1    n     superscript  x  n      \gamma_{n}(x)=\frac{1}{n!}x^{n}   if n \gamma_n(x) = 0 if    n  ≥  p      n  p    n\geq p   . (Note the distinction between    I  p     superscript  I  p    I^{p}   and the ideal generated by    x  p     superscript  x  p    x^{p}   for    x  ∈  I      x  I    x\in I   ; the latter is always zero if a divided power structure exists, while the former is not necessarily zero.)    If M is an A -module, let     S  ⋅   M       superscript  S  normal-⋅   M    S^{\cdot}M   denote the symmetric algebra of M over A . Then its dual      (    S  ⋅   M   )     ˇ    =   H  o   m  A    (    S  ⋅   M   ,  A  )             superscript  S  normal-⋅   M    normal-ˇ  absent      H  o   subscript  m  A       superscript  S  normal-⋅   M   A      (S^{\cdot}M)\check{~{}}=Hom_{A}(S^{\cdot}M,A)   has a canonical structure of divided power ring. In fact, it is canonically isomorphic to a natural completion of     Γ  A    (   M  ˇ   )        subscript  normal-Γ  A    normal-ˇ  M     \Gamma_{A}(\check{M})   (see below) if M has finite rank.   Constructions  If A is any ring, there exists a divided power ring      A   ⟨   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   ⟩       A    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n      A\langle x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}\rangle     consisting of divided power polynomials in the variables        x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n    ,      subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n},     that is sums of divided power monomials of the form      c   x  1   [   i  1   ]     x  2   [   i  2   ]    ⋯   x  n   [   i  n   ]        c   superscript   subscript  x  1    delimited-[]   subscript  i  1      superscript   subscript  x  2    delimited-[]   subscript  i  2     normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  x  n    delimited-[]   subscript  i  n       cx_{1}^{[i_{1}]}x_{2}^{[i_{2}]}\cdots x_{n}^{[i_{n}]}     with    c  ∈  A      c  A    c\in A   . Here the divided power ideal is the set of divided power polynomials with constant coefficient 0.  More generally, if M is an A -module, there is a universal  A -algebra, called        Γ  A    (  M  )    ,       subscript  normal-Γ  A   M    \Gamma_{A}(M),     with PD ideal       Γ  +    (  M  )        subscript  normal-Γ    M    \Gamma_{+}(M)     and an A -linear map       M  →    Γ  +    (  M  )     .     normal-→  M     subscript  normal-Γ    M     M\to\Gamma_{+}(M).     (The case of divided power polynomials is the special case in which M is a free module over A of finite rank.)  If I is any ideal of a ring A , there is a universal construction which extends A with divided powers of elements of I to get a divided power envelope of I in A .  Applications  The divided power envelope is a fundamental tool in the theory of PD differential operators and crystalline cohomology , where it is used to overcome technical difficulties which arise in positive characteristic .  The divided power functor is used in the construction of co-Schur functors.  References      "  Category:Commutative algebra  Category:Polynomials
