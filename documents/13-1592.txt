Orthogonal projections in A 5  Coxeter plane |} In five-dimensional geometry , a rectified 5-cube is a convex uniform 5-polytope , being a rectification of the regular 5-cube .  There are 5 degrees of rectifications of a 5-polytope, the zeroth here being the 5-cube , and the 4th and last being the 5-orthoplex . Vertices of the rectified 5-cube are located at the edge-centers of the 5-cube. Vertices of the birectified 5-ocube are located in the square face centers of the 5-cube.  Rectified 5-cube  Alternate names   Rectified penteract (acronym: rin) (Jonathan Bowers)   Construction  The rectified 5-cube may be constructed from the 5-cube by truncating its vertices at the midpoints of its edges.  Coordinates  The Cartesian coordinates of the vertices of the rectified 5-cube with edge length    2      2    \sqrt{2}   is given by all permutations of:      (  0  ,   ±  1   ,   ±  1   ,   ±  1   ,   ±  1   )     0   plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  1     (0,\ \pm 1,\ \pm 1,\ \pm 1,\ \pm 1)     Images  Birectified 5-cube  Alternate names   Birectified 5-cube/penteract  Birectified pentacross/5-orthoplex/triacontiditeron  Penteractitriacontiditeron (acronym: nit) (Jonathan Bowers)  Rectified 5-demicube/demipenteract   Construction and coordinates  The birectified 5-cube may be constructed by birectifing the vertices of the 5-cube at    2      2    \sqrt{2}   of the edge length.  The Cartesian coordinates of the vertices of a birectified 5-cube having edge length 2 are all permutations of:      (  0  ,  0  ,   ±  1   ,   ±  1   ,   ±  1   )     0  0   plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  1     \left(0,\ 0,\ \pm 1,\ \pm 1,\ \pm 1\right)     Images  Related polytopes  Related polytopes  Thes polytopes are a part of 31 uniform polytera generated from the regular 5-cube or 5-orthoplex .
