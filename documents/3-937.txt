   Piecewise linear function      Piecewise linear function   In mathematics , a piecewise linear function is a function composed of straight-line sections. 1 It is a piecewise -defined function whose pieces are affine functions.  If the function is continuous , the graph will be a polygonal curve .  Examples  The function defined by:       f   (  x  )    =   {       -  x   -  3       if  x   ≤   -  3         x  +  3       if  -  3   <  x  <  0         -   2  x    +  3       if  0   ≤  x  <  3         0.5  x   -  4.5       if  x   ≥  3             f  x    cases      x   3       if  x     3      x  3         if  3   x       0          2  x    3         if  0   x       3        0.5  x   4.5       if  x   3      f(x)=\begin{cases}-x-3&\text{if }x\leq-3\\
 x+3&\text{if }-3   is piecewise linear with four pieces. (The graph of this function is shown to the right.) Since the graph of a linear function is a line , the graph of a piecewise linear function consists of line segments and rays .  Other examples of piecewise linear functions include the absolute value function, the square wave , the sawtooth function , and the floor function .  Fitting to a curve  An approximation to a known curve can be found by sampling the curve and interpolating linearly between the points. An algorithm for computing the most significant points subject to a given error tolerance has been published. 2  Fitting to data  If partitions are already known, linear regression can be performed independently on these partitions. However, continuity is not preserved in that case. A stable algorithm with this case has been derived. 3  If partitions are not known, the residual sum of squares can be used to choose optimal separation points. 4  A variant of decision tree learning called model trees learns piecewise linear functions. 5  Notation  (Figure)  A piecewise linear function in two dimensions (top) and the convex polytopes on which it is linear (bottom).   The notion of a piecewise linear function makes sense in several different contexts. Piecewise linear functions may be defined on n-dimensional  Euclidean space , or more generally any vector space or affine space , as well as on piecewise linear manifolds , simplicial complexes , and so forth. In each case, the function may be real -valued, or it may take values from a vector space, an affine space, a piecewise-linear manifold, or a simplicial complex. (In these contexts, the term “linear” does not refer solely to linear transformations , but to more general affine linear functions.)  In dimensions higher than one, it is common to require the domain of each piece to be a polygon or polytope . This guarantees that the graph of the function will be composed of polygonal or polytopal pieces.  Important sub-classes of piecewise linear functions include the continuous piecewise linear functions and the convex piecewise linear functions. In general, for every n dimensional continuous piecewise linear function    f  :    ℝ  n   →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  ℝ  n   ℝ     f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}   , there is a      Π  ∈   𝒫   (   𝒫   (   ℝ   n  +  1    )    )        normal-Π    𝒫    𝒫   superscript  ℝ    n  1        \Pi\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{n+1}))     such that:        f   (   x  →   )    =     min   Σ  ∈  Π      max    (   a  →   ,  b  )   ∈  Σ      a  →   ⋅   x  →      +  b    .        f   normal-→  x        subscript     normal-Σ  normal-Π      subscript       normal-→  a   b   normal-Σ     normal-⋅   normal-→  a    normal-→  x      b     f(\vec{x})=\min_{\Sigma\in\Pi}\max_{(\vec{a},b)\in\Sigma}\vec{a}\cdot\vec{x}+b.     If   f   f   f   is convex as well as continuous, then there is a      Σ  ∈   𝒫   (   ℝ   n  +  1    )        normal-Σ    𝒫   superscript  ℝ    n  1       \Sigma\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})     such that:        f   (   x  →   )    =     max    (   a  →   ,  b  )   ∈  Σ      a  →   ⋅   x  →     +  b    .        f   normal-→  x        subscript       normal-→  a   b   normal-Σ     normal-⋅   normal-→  a    normal-→  x     b     f(\vec{x})=\max_{(\vec{a},b)\in\Sigma}\vec{a}\cdot\vec{x}+b.
