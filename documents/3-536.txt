Spectral radius

In mathematics, the spectral radius of a square matrix or a bounded linear operator is the supremum among the absolute values of the elements in its spectrum, which is sometimes denoted by ρ(·).
Matrices
Let  be the (real or complex) eigenvalues of a matrix . Then its spectral radius 
 
 
 
  is defined as:



 The following lemma shows a simple yet useful upper bound for the spectral radius of a matrix:

Lemma. Let  with spectral radius 
 
 
 
  and a consistent matrix norm

 
 ; then, for each 
 
 
 
 :
 
 




Proof: Let 
 
 
 
  be an eigenvector-eigenvalue pair for a matrix A. By the sub-multiplicative property of the matrix norm, we get:



and since 
 
 
 
  we have



and therefore



 The spectral radius is closely related to the behaviour of the convergence of the power sequence of a matrix; namely, the following theorem holds:

Theorem. Let  with spectral radius 
 
 
 
 ; then 
 
 

Moreover, if 
 
 
 
 , Ak{{!!}}}} is not bounded for increasing values of 
 
 
 
 .
 

Proof. Assume the limit in question is zero, we will show that 
 
 




and, since by hypothesis 
 
 
 
 , we must have



which implies |λ| $A$ is less than 
 
 
 
 . From the Jordan normal form theorem, we know that for all , there exist  with 
 
 
 
  non-singular and 
 
 
 
  block diagonal such that:



with



where



It is easy to see that



and, since 
 
 
 
  is block-diagonal,



Now, a standard result on the 
 
 
 
 -power of an 
 
 
 
  Jordan block states that, for 
 
 
 
 
 :



Thus, if 
 
 
 
  then for all 
 
 

 
 . Hence for all 
 
 
 
  we have:



which implies



Therefore,



On the other side, if 
 
 
 
 , there is at least one element in 
 
 
 
  which doesn't remain bounded as k increases, so proving the second part of the statement.
Gelfand's Formula

Theorem (Gelfand's Formula; 1941). For any matrix norm

 
  we have
 
 




The formula holds for any Banach algebra; see 
Proof
For any 
 
 
 
 , first we construct the following two matrices:



Then:



First we apply the previous theorem to :



That means, by the sequence limit definition, there exists  such that



Applying the previous theorem to  implies 
 
 
 
  is not bounded and there exists  such that



Let  then we have:



which, by definition, is



Corollaries
Gelfand's formula leads directly to a bound on the spectral radius of a product of finitely many matrices, namely assuming that they all commute we obtain



Actually, in case the norm is consistent, the proof shows more than the thesis; in fact, using the previous lemma, we can replace in the limit definition the left lower bound with the spectral radius itself and write more precisely:



which, by definition, is



Example
Consider the matrix



whose eigenvalues are 
 
 
 
 ; by definition, 
 
 
 
 . In the following table, the values of 
 
 
 
  for the four most used norms are listed versus several increasing values of k (note that, due to the particular form of this matrix,
 
 
 
 ):

Bounded Linear Operators
For a bounded linear operator

 
  and the operator norm ||·||, again we have



A bounded operator (on a complex Hilbert space) called a spectraloid operator if its spectral radius coincides with its numerical radius. An example of such an operator is a normal operator.
Graphs
The spectral radius of a finite graph is defined to be the spectral radius of its adjacency matrix.
This definition extends to the case of infinite graphs with bounded degrees of vertices (i.e. there exists some real number 
 
 
 
  such that the degree of every vertex of the graph is smaller than 
 
 
 
 ). In this case, for the graph 
 
 
 
  define:



Let 
 
 
 
  be the adjacency operator of 
 
 
 
 :



The spectral radius of $G$ is defined to be the spectral radius of the bounded linear operator $γ$.
