   Born–von Karman boundary condition      Born–von Karman boundary condition   The Born–von Karman boundary condition are periodic boundary conditions which impose the restriction that a wave function must be periodic on a certain Bravais lattice . (Named after Max Born and Theodore von Kármán ). This condition is often applied in solid state physics to model an ideal crystal .  The condition can be stated as        ψ   (   𝕣  +    N  i    𝕒  i     )    =   ψ   (  𝕣  )     ,        ψ    𝕣     subscript  N  i    subscript  𝕒  i        ψ  𝕣     \psi(\mathbb{r}+N_{i}\mathbb{a}_{i})=\psi(\mathbb{r}),\,     where i runs over the dimensions of the Bravais lattice, the a i are the primitive vectors of the lattice, and the N i are any integers (assuming the lattice is infinite). This definition can be used to show that       ψ   (   𝕣  +  𝕋   )    =   ψ   (  𝕣  )          ψ    𝕣  𝕋      ψ  𝕣     \psi(\mathbb{r}+\mathbb{T})=\psi(\mathbb{r})     for any lattice translation vector T such that:       𝕋  =    ∑  i     N  i    𝕒  i      .      𝕋    subscript   i      subscript  N  i    subscript  𝕒  i       \mathbb{T}=\sum_{i}N_{i}\mathbb{a}_{i}.     Note, however, the Born–von Karman boundary conditions are useful when N i are large (infinite).  The Born–von Karman boundary condition is important in solid state physics for analyzing many features of crystals, such as diffraction and the band gap . Modeling the potential of a crystal as a periodic function with the Born–von Karman boundary condition and plugging in Schrödinger's equation results in a proof of Bloch's theorem , which is particularly important in understanding the band structure of crystals.
