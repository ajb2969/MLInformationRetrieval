   Esscher principle      Esscher principle   The Esscher principle is a insurance premium principle . It is given by     π   [  X  ,  h  ]    =     E   [   X   e   h  X     ]    /  E    [   e   h  X    ]          π   X  h          E   delimited-[]    X   superscript  e    h  X       E    delimited-[]   superscript  e    h  X        \pi[X,h]=E[Xe^{hX}]/E[e^{hX}]   , where   h   h   h   is a strictly positive parameter. This premium is in fact the net premium for a risk    Y  =     X   e   h  X     /   m  X     (  h  )        Y        X   superscript  e    h  X      subscript  m  X    h     Y=Xe^{hX}/m_{X}(h)   , where     m  X    (  h  )        subscript  m  X   h    m_{X}(h)   denotes the moment generating function .  The Esscher principle is a Risk measure used in actuarial sciences that derives from Esscher transform . This risk measure doesn't respect the positive homogeneity propertie of Coherent risk measure for    h  >  0      h  0    h>0   .  "  Category:Actuarial science
