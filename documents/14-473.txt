   Strictly singular operator      Strictly singular operator   In functional analysis , a branch of mathematics , a strictly singular operator is a bounded linear operator  L from a Banach space  X to another Banach space Y , such that it is not an isomorphism , and fails to be an isomorphism on any infinite dimensional subspace of X . Any compact operator is strictly singular, but not vice versa. 1 2  Every bounded linear map    T  :    l  p   →   l  q       normal-:  T   normal-→   subscript  l  p    subscript  l  q      T:l_{p}\to l_{q}   , for     1  ≤  q   ,   p  <  ∞      formulae-sequence    1  q     p      1\leq q,p<\infty   ,    p  ≠  q      p  q    p\neq q   , is strictly singular. Here,    l  p     subscript  l  p    l_{p}   and    l  q     subscript  l  q    l_{q}   are sequence spaces . Similarly, every bounded linear map    T  :    c  0   →   l  p       normal-:  T   normal-→   subscript  c  0    subscript  l  p      T:c_{0}\to l_{p}   and    T  :    l  p   →   c  0       normal-:  T   normal-→   subscript  l  p    subscript  c  0      T:l_{p}\to c_{0}   , for    1  ≤  p  <  ∞        1  p           1\leq p<\infty   , is strictly singular. Here    c  0     subscript  c  0    c_{0}   is the Banach space of sequences converging to zero.
