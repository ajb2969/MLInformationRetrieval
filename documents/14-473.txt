Strictly singular operator

In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, a strictly singular operator is a bounded linear operator L from a Banach space X to another Banach space Y, such that it is not an isomorphism, and fails to be an isomorphism on any infinite dimensional subspace of X. Any compact operator is strictly singular, but not vice versa.12
Every bounded linear map

  are sequence spaces. Similarly, every bounded linear map 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , for

  is the Banach space of sequences converging to zero. This is a corollary of Pitt's theorem, which states that such T, for q
