Codazzi tensor

Codazzi tensors (named after Delfino Codazzi) arise very naturally in the study of Riemannian manifolds with harmonic curvature or harmonic Weyl tensor. In fact, existence of Codazzi tensors impose strict conditions on the curvature tensor of the manifold.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a n-dimensional Riemannian manifold for 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be a tensor, and let 
 
 
 
  be a Levi-Civita connection on the manifold. We say that the tensor 
 
 
 
  is a Codazzi Tensor if 
 
 
 
 .
