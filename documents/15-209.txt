   Codazzi tensor      Codazzi tensor   Codazzi tensors (named after Delfino Codazzi ) arise very naturally in the study of Riemannian manifolds with harmonic  curvature or harmonic Weyl tensor . In fact, existence of Codazzi tensors impose strict conditions on the curvature tensor of the manifold.  Definition  Let    (  M  ,  g  )     M  g    (M,g)   be a n-dimensional Riemannian manifold for    n  ≥  3      n  3    n\geq 3   , let   T   T   T   be a tensor , and let   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   be a Levi-Civita connection on the manifold. We say that the tensor   T   T   T   is a Codazzi Tensor if      (    ∇  X   T   )   g   (  Y  ,  Z  )    =    (    ∇  Y   T   )   g   (  X  ,  Z  )            subscript  normal-∇  X   T   g   Y  Z        subscript  normal-∇  Y   T   g   X  Z      (\nabla_{X}T)g(Y,Z)=(\nabla_{Y}T)g(X,Z)   .
