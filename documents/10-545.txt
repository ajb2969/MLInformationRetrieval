   Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH)      Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH)   In enzymology , a hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-mevalonate + CoA + 2 NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA + 2 NADPH + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (R)- mevalonate , CoA , and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , to be specific those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of steroids including cholesterol. The statin class of anticholesterol drugs act through inhibiting this enzyme.  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-mevalonate:NADP + oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating). Other names in common use include:   hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (reduced nicotinamide  adenine dinucleotide phosphate), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase  β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase  hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (NADPH)  S-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase  NADPH-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase  HMGCoA reductase-mevalonate:NADP-oxidoreductase (acetylating-CoA)  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (NADPH)  hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH 2 ).   Structural studies  As of late 2007, 12 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , and .
