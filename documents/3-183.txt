   Laplace number      Laplace number   The Laplace number ( La ), also known as the Suratman number ( Su ), is a dimensionless number used in the characterization of free surface fluid dynamics . It represents a ratio of surface tension to the momentum -transport (especially dissipation ) inside a fluid.  It is defined as follows:      La  =  Su  =    σ  ρ  L    μ  2          La  Su           σ  ρ  L    superscript  μ  2       \mathrm{La}=\mathrm{Su}=\frac{\sigma\rho L}{\mu^{2}}     where:   σ = surface tension  ρ = density  L = length  μ = liquid viscosity   Laplace number is related to Reynolds number (Re) and Weber number (We) in the following way:      La  =    Re  2   We       La     superscript  Re  2   We     \mathrm{La}=\frac{\mathrm{Re}^{2}}{\mathrm{We}}     See also   Ohnesorge number - There is an inverse relationship,    La  =   Oh   -  2        La   superscript  Oh    2      \mathrm{La}=\mathrm{Oh}^{-2}   , between the Laplace number and the Ohnesorge number.
