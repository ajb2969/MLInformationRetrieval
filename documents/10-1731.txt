   2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase      2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase   In enzymology , a 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase () is an enzyme is a lyase which participates in biosynthesis of steroids . It catalyzes the chemical reaction :   2-phospho-4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate + CMP   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-phospho-4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol , and two products , 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate and CMP .  The enzyme is considered a phosphorus-oxygen lyase. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-phospho-4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol CMP-lyase (cyclizing; 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate-forming) . Other names in common use include MECDP-synthase , 2-phospho-4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol , and CMP-lyase (cyclizing) .
