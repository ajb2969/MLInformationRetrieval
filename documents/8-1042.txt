   File:Bjt equilibrium bands v2.svg      File:Bjt equilibrium bands v2.svg   == Summary == Energy band diagram of a simple NPN bipolar junction transistor under equilibrium showing electron energy versus position. The depletion regions of the emitter-base and base-collector junctions are marked.    E  c     subscript  E  c    E_{c}   is the conduction band ,    E  f     subscript  E  f    E_{f}   is the device fermi energy level,    E  i     subscript  E  i    E_{i}   is the intrinsic Fermi level of the undoped semiconductor, and    E  v     subscript  E  v    E_{v}   is the valence band .
