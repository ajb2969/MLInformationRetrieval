== Summary == Energy band diagram of a simple NPN bipolar junction transistor under equilibrium showing electron energy versus position. The depletion regions of the emitter-base and base-collector junctions are marked. 
 
 
 
  is the conduction band, 
 
 
 
  is the device fermi energy level, 
 
 
 
  is the intrinsic Fermi level of the undoped semiconductor, and 
 
 
 
  is the valence band.
