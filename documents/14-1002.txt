   Standard complex      Standard complex    Standard resolution redirects here, for the television monitor size, see standard definition    In mathematics, the standard complex , also called standard resolution , bar resolution , bar complex , bar construction , is a way of constructing resolutions in homological algebra . It was first introduced for the special case of algebras over a commutative ring by  and  and has since been generalized in many ways.  The name "bar complex" comes from the fact that  used a vertical bar | as a shortened form of the tensor product ⊗ in their notation for the complex.  Definition  If A is an associative algebra over a field K , the standard complex is       ⋯  →   A  ⊗  A  ⊗  A   →   A  ⊗  A   →  A  →   0    ,       normal-→  normal-⋯   tensor-product  A  A  A     normal-→     tensor-product  A  A     normal-→    A    normal-→    0     \cdots\rightarrow A\otimes A\otimes A\rightarrow A\otimes A\rightarrow A%
