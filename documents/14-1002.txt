In mathematics, the standard complex, also called standard resolution, bar resolution, bar complex, bar construction, is a way of constructing resolutions in homological algebra. It was first introduced for the special case of algebras over a commutative ring by  and  and has since been generalized in many ways.
The name "bar complex" comes from the fact that  used a vertical bar | as a shortened form of the tensor product ⊗ in their notation for the complex.
Definition
If A is an associative algebra over a field K, the standard complex is


 
  with the differential given by


 
  If A is a unital K-algebra, the standard complex is exact. 
 
 
 
  is a free A-bimodule resolution of the A-bimodule A.
Normalized standard complex
The normalized (or reduced) standard complex replaces A⊗A⊗...⊗A⊗A with A⊗(A/K)⊗...⊗(A/K)⊗A.
