Reed–Muller expansion

In Boolean logic, a Reed–Muller (or Davio) expansion is a decomposition of a boolean function.
For a boolean function 
 
 
 
  we set with respect to 
 
 
 
 :



as the positive and negative cofactors of 
 
 
 
 , and the boolean derivation of 
 
 
 
 .
Then we have for the Reed–Muller or positive Davio expansion:



Similar to binary decision diagrams (BDDs), where nodes represent Shannon expansion with respect to the according variable, we can define a decision diagram based on the Reed–Muller expansion. These decision diagrams are called functional BDDs (FBDDs).
