   Reed–Muller expansion      Reed–Muller expansion   In Boolean logic , a Reed–Muller (or Davio ) expansion is a decomposition of a boolean function .  For a boolean function    f   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )       f    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})   we set with respect to    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   :       f   x  i     (  x  )        subscript  f   subscript  x  i    x    \displaystyle f_{{x_{i}}}(x)     as the positive and negative cofactors of   f   f   f   , and the boolean derivation of   f   f   f   .  Then we have for the Reed–Muller or positive Davio expansion:       f  =    f    x  ¯   i    ⊕    x  i     ∂  f    ∂   x  i        .      f   direct-sum   subscript  f   subscript   normal-¯  x   i       subscript  x  i       f      subscript  x  i         f=f_{\overline{x}_{i}}\oplus x_{i}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}.     Similar to binary decision diagrams (BDDs), where nodes represent Shannon expansion with respect to the according variable, we can define a decision diagram based on the Reed–Muller expansion. These decision diagrams are called functional BDDs (FBDDs).
