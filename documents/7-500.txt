Pion decay constant

In particle physics, the pion decay constant is the square root of the coefficient in front of the kinetic term for the pion in the low-energy effective action. It is dimensionally an energy scale and it determines the strength of the chiral symmetry breaking. The values are:
$$f_{\pi^{\pm}} = 130.41 \pm 0.03 \pm 0.20~\mbox{MeV}$$
$$f_{\pi^{0}} = 130 \pm 5~\mbox{MeV}$$
Beware: There are several conventions which differ by powers of $\scriptstyle \sqrt{2}$. The textbook by Weinberg uses the value 184 MeV. The textbook by Peskin and Schroeder uses the value 93 MeV.
