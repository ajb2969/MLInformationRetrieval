   Taurine—2-oxoglutarate transaminase      Taurine—2-oxoglutarate transaminase   In enzymology , a taurine-2-oxoglutarate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   taurine + 2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   sulfoacetaldehyde + L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are taurine and 2-oxoglutarate , whereas its two products are sulfoacetaldehyde and L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is taurine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include taurine aminotransferase , taurine transaminase , taurine-alpha-ketoglutarate aminotransferase , and taurine-glutamate transaminase . This enzyme participates in beta-alanine metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .
