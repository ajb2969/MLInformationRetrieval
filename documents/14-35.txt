   Trajectory (fluid mechanics)      Trajectory (fluid mechanics)   In fluid mechanics , meteorology and oceanography , a trajectory traces the motion of a single point, often called a parcel , in the flow.  Trajectories are useful for tracking atmospheric contaminants, such as smoke plumes, and as constituents to Lagrangian simulations, such as contour advection or semi-Lagrangian schemes .  Suppose we have a time-varying flow field,     v  →    (   x  →   ,  t  )        normal-→  v     normal-→  x   t     \vec{v}(\vec{x},~{}t)   . The motion of a fluid parcel, or trajectory, is given by the following system of ordinary differential equations :        d   x  →     d  t    =    v  →    (   x  →   ,  t  )            d   normal-→  x      d  t       normal-→  v     normal-→  x   t      \frac{d\vec{x}}{dt}=\vec{v}(\vec{x},~{}t)     While the equation looks simple, there are at least three concerns when attempting to solve it numerically . The first is the integration scheme . This is typically a Runge-Kutta , 1 although others can be useful as well, such as a leapfrog . The second is the method of determining the velocity vector,    v  →     normal-→  v    \vec{v}   at a given position,    x  →     normal-→  x    \vec{x}   , and time, t . Normally, it is not known at all positions and times, therefore some method of interpolation is required. If the velocities are gridded in space and time, then bilinear , trilinear or higher-dimensional linear interpolation is appropriate. Bicubic , tricubic , etc., interpolation is used as well, but is probably not worth the extra computational overhead .  Velocity fields can be determined by measurement, e.g. from weather balloons , from numerical models or especially from a combination of the two, e.g. assimilation models .  The final concern is metric corrections. These are necessary for geophysical fluid flows on a spherical Earth. The differential equations for tracing a two-dimensional, atmospheric trajectory in longitude-latitude coordinates are as follows:        d  θ    d  t    =   u   r   cos  ϕ             d  θ     d  t      u    r    ϕ       \frac{d\theta}{dt}=\frac{u}{r\cos\phi}           d  ϕ    d  t    =   v  r           d  ϕ     d  t      v  r     \frac{d\phi}{dt}=\frac{v}{r}     where,   θ   θ   \theta   and   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   are, respectively, the longitude and latitude in radians , r is the radius of the Earth , u is the zonal wind and v is the meridional wind.  One problem with this formulation is the polar singularity: notice how the denominator in the first equation goes to zero when the latitude is 90 degrees—plus or minus. One means of overcoming this is to use a locally Cartesian coordinate system close to the poles. Another is to perform the integration on a pair of Azimuthal equidistant projections —one for the N. Hemisphere and one for the S. Hemisphere. 2  Trajectories can be validated by balloons in the atmosphere and buoys in the ocean .  External links   ctraj : A trajectory integrator written in C++.
