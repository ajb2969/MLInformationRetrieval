Interacting particle system

In probability theory, an interacting particle system (IPS) is a stochastic process

 
  on some configuration space 
 
 
 
  given by a site space, a countable-infinite graph

 
  and a local state space, a compact metric space

 
 
 . More precisely IPS are continuous-time Markov jump processes describing the collective behavior of stochastically interacting components. IPS are the continuous-time analogue of stochastic cellular automata. Among the main examples are the voter model, the contact process, the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), the Glauber dynamics and in particular the stochastic Ising model.
IPS are usually defined via their Markov generator giving rise to a unique Markov process using Markov semigroups and the Hille-Yosida theorem. The generator again is given via so-called transition rates 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a finite set of sites and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 
 . The rates describe exponential waiting times of the process to jump from configuration 
 
 
 
  into configuration 
 
 
 
 . More generally the transition rates are given in form of a finite measure 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 . The generator 
 
 
 
 
  of an IPS has the following form: Let 
 
 
 
  be an observable in the domain of 
 
 
 
  which is a subset of the real valued continuous function on the configuration space, then


 
 .
For example for the stochastic Ising model we have 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
  and



where 
 
 
 
 
  is the configuration equal to 
 
 
 
  except it is flipped at site 
 
 
 
 .
