Zeaxanthin epoxidase

Zeaxanthin epoxidase (, Zea-epoxidase) is an enzyme with system name zeaxanthin,NAD(P)H:oxygen oxidoreductase.1234567 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

zeaxanthin + 2 NAD(P)H + 2 H+ + 2 O2

 
  violaxanthin + 2 NAD(P)+ + 2 H2O (overall reaction)
 
(1a) zeaxanthin + NAD(P)H + H+ + O2

 
  antheraxanthin + NAD(P)+ + H2O
 
(1b) antheraxanthin + NAD(P)H + H+ + O2

 
  violaxanthin + NAD(P)+ + H2O
 

Zeaxanthin epoxidase is a flavoprotein (FAD) that is active under conditions of low light.
