   Zeaxanthin epoxidase      Zeaxanthin epoxidase   Zeaxanthin epoxidase (, Zea-epoxidase ) is an enzyme with system name zeaxanthin,NAD(P)H:oxygen oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   zeaxanthin + 2 NAD(P)H + 2 H + + 2 O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   violaxanthin + 2 NAD(P) + + 2 H 2 O (overall reaction)  (1a) zeaxanthin + NAD(P)H + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   antheraxanthin + NAD(P) + + H 2 O  (1b) antheraxanthin + NAD(P)H + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   violaxanthin + NAD(P) + + H 2 O   Zeaxanthin epoxidase is a flavoprotein (FAD) that is active under conditions of low light.
