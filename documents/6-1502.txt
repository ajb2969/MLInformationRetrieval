Benedict–Webb–Rubin equation
The '''Benedict–Webb–Rubin equation''' ('''BWR'''), named after [[Manson Benedict]], G. 
 B. Webb, and L. C. Rubin, is an equation of state used in fluid dynamics. Working at the research laboratory of M. W. Kellogg Limited, the three researchers rearranged the Beattie-Bridgeman Equation of State and increased the number of experimentally determined constants to eight.12
The original BWR equation



The BWRS equation of state
A modification of the Benedict–Webb–Rubin equation of state by Professor Kenneth E. Starling of the University of Oklahoma:3




ρ = the molar density.
 

Values of the various parameters for 15 substances can be found in Starling's Fluid Properties for Light Petroleum Systems..4
The Modified BWR equation (mBWR)
A further modification of the Benedict–Webb–Rubin equation of state by Jacobsen and Stewart:







where:



 The mBWR equation subsequently evolved into a 32 term version (Younglove and Ely, 1987) with numerical parameters determined by fitting the equation to empirical data for a reference fluid.5 Other fluids then are described by using reduced variables for temperature and density.6
