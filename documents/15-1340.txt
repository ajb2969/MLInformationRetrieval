2-Ketoarginine methyltransferase

2-Ketoarginine methyltransferase (, mrsA (gene)) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:5-carbamimidamido-2-oxopentanoate S-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 5-guanidino-2-oxopentanoate

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-guanidino-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate
 

The enzyme is involved in production of the rare amino acid 3-methylarginine.
