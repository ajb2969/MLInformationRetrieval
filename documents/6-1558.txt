   Blattner's conjecture      Blattner's conjecture  In [[mathematics]], '''Blattner's conjecture''' or '''Blattner's formula''' is a description of the [[discrete series representation]]s of a general [[semisimple group]] ''G'' in terms of their [[restricted represent ation]]s to a maximal compact subgroup  K (their so-called K -types). Harish-Chandra orally attributed the conjecture to Robert J Blattner as a question Blattner raised, not a conjecture made by Blattner. Blattner did not publish it in any form. It first appeared in print in , where it was first referred to as "Blattner's Conjecture," despite the results of that paper having been obtained without knowledge of Blattner's question and notwithstanding Blattner's not having made such a conjecture.  mentioned a special case of it slightly earlier.  proved Blattner's formula in some special cases,  showed that Blattner's formula gave an upper bound for the multiplicities of K -representations,  proved Blattner's conjecture for groups whose symmetric space is Hermitian, and  proved Blattner's conjecture for linear semisimple groups.  Statement  Blattner's formula says that if a discrete series representation with infinitesimal character λ is restricted to a maximal compact subgroup K , then the representation of K with highest weight μ occurs with multiplicity       ∑   w  ∈   W  K      ϵ   (  ω  )   Q   (    w   (   μ  +   ρ  c    )    -  λ  -   ρ  n    )        subscript     w   subscript  W  K       ϵ  ω  Q      w    μ   subscript  ρ  c     λ   subscript  ρ  n       \sum_{w\in W_{K}}\epsilon(\omega)Q(w(\mu+\rho_{c})-\lambda-\rho_{n})   where   Q is the number of ways a vector can be written as a sum of non-compact positive roots  W K is the Weyl group of K   ρ c is half the sum of the compact roots  ρ n is half the sum of the non-compact roots  ε is the sign character of W K .   Blattner's formula is what one gets by formally restricting the Harish-Chandra character formula for a discrete series representation to the maximal torus of a maximal compact group. The problem in proving the Blattner formula is that this only gives the character on the regular elements of the maximal torus, and one also needs to control its behavior on the singular elements. For non-discrete irreducible representations the formal restriction of Harish-Chandra's character formula need not give the decomposition under the maximal compact subgroup: for example, for the principal series representations of SL 2 the character is identically zero on the non-singular elements of the maximal compact subgroup, but the representation is not zero on this subgroup. In this case the character is a distribution on the maximal compact subgroup with support on the singular elements.
