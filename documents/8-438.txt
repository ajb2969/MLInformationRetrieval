   Dermott's law      Dermott's law   Dermott's law is an empirical formula for the orbital period of major satellites orbiting planets in the Solar System . It was identified by the celestial mechanics researcher Stanley Dermott in the 1960s and takes the form:       T   (  n  )    =    T   (  0  )    ⋅   C  n          T  n    normal-⋅    T  0    superscript  C  n      T(n)=T(0)\cdot C^{n}     for    n  =   1  ,  2  ,  3  ,   4  …        n   1  2  3    4  normal-…      \scriptstyle n=1,2,3,4\ldots     Where T(n) is the orbital period of the n th satellite, T(0) is of the order of days and C is a constant of the satellite system in question. Specific values are:   Jovian system :     T(0) = 0.444 d , C = 2.03  Saturnian system : T(0) = 0.462 d, C = 1.59  Uranian system :    T(0) = 0.488 d, C = 2.24   Such power-laws may be a consequence of collapsing-cloud models of planetary and satellite systems possessing various symmetries; see Titius-Bode law . They may also reflect the effect of resonance -driven commensurabilities in the various systems.
