2-haloacid dehalogenase (configuration-retaining)

2-haloacid dehalogenase (configuration-retaining) (, 2-haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase, 2-haloalkanoid acid halidohydrolase, DL-2-haloacid dehalogenase, DL-DEXr) is an enzyme with system name (S)-2-haloacid dehalogenase (configuration-retaining).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) (S)-2-haloacid + H2O 
 
 
 
  (S)-2-hydroxyacid + halide

(2) (R)-2-haloacid + H2O 
 
 
 
  (R)-2-hydroxyacid + halide
 

Dehalogenates both (S)- and (R)-2-haloalkanoic acids to the corresponding (S)- and (R)-hydroxyalkanoic acids.
