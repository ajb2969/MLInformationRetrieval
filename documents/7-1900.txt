Central subgroup

In mathematics, in the field of group theory, a subgroup of a group is termed central if it lies inside the center of the group.
Given a group 
 
 
 
 , the center of 
 
 
 
 , denoted as 
 
 
 
 , is defined as the set of those elements of the group which commute with every element of the group. The center is a characteristic subgroup and is also an abelian group (because, in particular, all elements of the center must commute with each other). A subgroup 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is termed central if 
 
 
 
 .
Central subgroups have the following properties:

They are abelian groups.
They are normal subgroups. They are central factors, and are hence transitively normal subgroups.
