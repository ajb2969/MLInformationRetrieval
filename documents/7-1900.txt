   Central subgroup      Central subgroup   In mathematics , in the field of group theory , a subgroup of a group is termed central if it lies inside the center of the group.  Given a group   G   G   G   , the center of   G   G   G   , denoted as    Z   (  G  )       Z  G    Z(G)   , is defined as the set of those elements of the group which commute with every element of the group. The center is a characteristic subgroup and is also an abelian group (because, in particular, all elements of the center must commute with each other). A subgroup   H   H   H   of   G   G   G   is termed central if    H  â‰¤   Z   (  G  )        H    Z  G     H\leq Z(G)   .  Central subgroups have the following properties:   They are abelian groups.  They are normal subgroups . They are central factors , and are hence transitively normal subgroups .   References    .
