Control variates

The control variates method is a variance reduction technique used in Monte Carlo methods. It exploits information about the errors in estimates of known quantities to reduce the error of an estimate of an unknown quantity.1
Underlying principle
Let the unknown parameter of interest be 
 
 
 
 , and assume we have a statistic

 
  such that the expected value of m is μ
 
 
 
 , i.e. m is an unbiased estimator for μ. Suppose we calculate another statistic 
 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is a known value. Then



is also an unbiased estimator for 
 
 
 
  for any choice of the coefficient 
 
 
 
 . The variance of the resulting estimator 
 
 
 
 
  is



It can be shown that choosing the optimal coefficient



minimizes the variance of 
 
 
 
 , and that with this choice,



where



is the correlation coefficient of m and t. The greater the value of 
 
 
 
 , the greater the variance reduction achieved.
In the case that 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and/or 
 
 
 
  are unknown, they can be estimated across the Monte Carlo replicates. This is equivalent to solving a certain least squares system; therefore this technique is also known as regression sampling.
Example
We would like to estimate


 
  using Monte Carlo integration. This integral is the expected value of 
 
 
 
 , where


 
  and U follows a uniform distribution [0, 1]. Using a sample of size n denote the points in the sample as 
 
 
 
 . Then the estimate is given by



Now we introduce 
 
 
 
  as a control variate with a known expected value 
 
 
 
  and combine the two into a new estimate



Using 
 
 
 
  realizations and an estimated optimal coefficient 
 
 
 
  we obtain the following results

The variance was significantly reduced after using the control variates technique. (The exact result is
