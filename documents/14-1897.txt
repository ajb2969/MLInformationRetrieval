   Denjoy–Koksma inequality      Denjoy–Koksma inequality   In mathematics, the Denjoy–Koksma inequality , introduced by  as a combination of work of Arnaud Denjoy and the Koksma–Hlawka inequality of Jurjen Ferdinand Koksma , is a bound for Weyl sums      ∑   k  =  0    m  -  1     f   (   x  +   k  ω    )        superscript   subscript     k  0      m  1      f    x    k  ω       \sum_{k=0}^{m-1}f(x+k\omega)   of functions f of bounded variation .  Statement  Suppose that a map f from the circle T to itself has irrational rotation number α , and p / q is a rational approximation to α with p and q  coprime , | α – p / q | 2. Suppose that φ is a function of bounded variation, and μ a probability measure on the circle invariant under f .
