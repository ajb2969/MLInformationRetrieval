Formulae of shapes

This article gives some formulae of some shapes, using words rather than symbols.
2-dimensional space
Perimeter
Circle/spherical digon/spherical henagon

Perimeter = π × diameter.
 

Polygons

Perimeter = The sum of the lengths of the sides.
 

Area
Circle/spherical digon/spherical henagon

Area = π × radius2


Ellipse

Area = Half of short axis × half of long axis × π


Triangle
Equilateral triangle

Area = 
 
 
 
  × side2 ÷ 4
 

Right-angled

Area = One leg × the other leg ÷ 2
 

General

Area = Base × height ÷ 2
 
Numerous other formulas are given here


Quadrilateral
Square

Area = Side2


Rectangle

Area = One side × the other side
 

Parallelogram

Area = One side × height from that side
 

Trapezoid

Area = Sum of the lengths of the parallel sides × height between the parallel sides ÷ 2
 

Kite or other quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals

Area = One diagonal × the other diagonal ÷ 2
 

Bicentric quadrilateral (with both an incircle and a circumcircle)

Area = Square root of the product of the four sides
 

Regular polygon

Area = Perimeter × distance from the center to a side ÷ 2
 

3-dimensional space
Surface area
Sphere

Surface area = 4 × radius2 × π
 

Cone

Surface area = π × (radius of base)2 + π × (radius of base) × height of cone
 

Cylinder

Surface area = 2 × π × radius × height + 2 × π × radius2


Regular tetrahedron

Surface area = 
 
 
 
  × (edge length)2


Square-based pyramid

Surface area = (Side of base)2 + 2 × (side of base) × slant height


Cube

Surface area = (Side)2 × 6
 

Regular octahedron

Surface area = 2 × 
 
 
 
  × (edge length)2


Volume
Sphere

Volume = 
 
 
 
  × π × radius3


Cone

Volume = 
 
 
 
  × π × (radius of base)2 × height
 

Cylinder

Volume = π × radius2 × height
 

Cube

Volume = Side3


Regular cuboid

Volume = The product of the three sides
 

4-dimensional space
Hypervolume
Tesseract

Hypervolume = Side4
