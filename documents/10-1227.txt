   Pyranose oxidase      Pyranose oxidase   In enzymology , a pyranose oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-glucose + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-dehydro-D-glucose + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-glucose and O 2 , whereas its two products are 2-dehydro-D-glucose and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pyranose:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include glucose 2-oxidase , and pyranose-2-oxidase . This enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway . It employs one cofactor , FAD .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 8 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , and .
