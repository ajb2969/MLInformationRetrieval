Ziegler–Nichols method

The Ziegler–Nichols tuning method is a heuristic method of tuning a PID controller. It was developed by John G. Ziegler and Nathaniel B. Nichols. It is performed by setting the I (integral) and D (derivative) gains to zero. The "P" (proportional) gain, 
 
 
 
  is then increased (from zero) until it reaches the ultimate gain

 
 , at which the output of the control loop oscillates with a constant amplitude. 
 
 
 
  and the oscillation period 
 
 
 
  are used to set the P, I, and D gains depending on the type of controller used:

Evaluation
Z–N tuning creates a "quarter wave decay". This is an acceptable result for some purposes, but not optimal for all applications.
The Ziegler-Nichols tuning rule is meant to give PID loops best disturbance rejection.5
Z–N yields an aggressive gain and overshoot6 – some applications wish to instead minimize or eliminate overshoot, and for these Z–N is inappropriate.
