Complex analytic space

In mathematics, a complex analytic space is a generalization of a complex manifold which allows the presence of singularities. Complex analytic spaces are locally ringed spaces which are locally isomorphic to local model spaces, where a local model space is an open subset of the vanishing locus of a finite set of holomorphic functions.
Definition
Denote the constant sheaf on a topological space with value 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . A 

 
 -space is a locally ringed space

 
  whose structure sheaf is an algebra over 
 
 
 
 .
Choose an open subset 
 
 
 
  of some complex affine space

 
 , and fix finitely many holomorphic functions 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the common vanishing locus of these holomorphic functions, that is, 
 
 
 
 . Define a sheaf of rings on 
 
 
 
  by letting 
 
 
 
  be the restriction to 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the sheaf of holomorphic functions on 
 
 
 
 . Then the locally ringed 
 
 
 
 -space 
 
 
 
  is a local model space.
A complex analytic space is a locally ringed 
 
 
 
 -space 
 
 
 
  which is locally isomorphic to a local model space.
Morphisms of complex analytic spaces are defined to be morphisms of the underlying locally ringed spaces, they are also called holomorphic maps.
