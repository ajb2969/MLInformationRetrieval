   Complex analytic space      Complex analytic space   In mathematics , a complex analytic space is a generalization of a complex manifold which allows the presence of singularities . Complex analytic spaces are locally ringed spaces which are locally isomorphic to local model spaces, where a local model space is an open subset of the vanishing locus of a finite set of holomorphic functions .  Definition  Denote the constant sheaf on a topological space with value   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   by    ℂ  ¯     normal-¯  ℂ    \underline{\mathbb{C}}   . A    ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   -space is a locally ringed space     (  X  ,   𝒪  X   )     X   subscript  𝒪  X     (X,\mathcal{O}_{X})   whose structure sheaf is an algebra over    ℂ  ¯     normal-¯  ℂ    \underline{\mathbb{C}}   .  Choose an open subset   U   U   U   of some complex affine space     ℂ  n     superscript  ℂ  n    \mathbb{C}^{n}   , and fix finitely many holomorphic functions     f  1   ,  …  ,   f  k       subscript  f  1   normal-…   subscript  f  k     f_{1},\dots,f_{k}   in   U   U   U   . Let    X  =   V   (   f  1   ,  …  ,   f  k   )        X    V    subscript  f  1   normal-…   subscript  f  k       X=V(f_{1},\dots,f_{k})   be the common vanishing locus of these holomorphic functions, that is,    X  =   {  x  ∣     f  1    (  x  )    =  ⋯  =    f  k    (  x  )    =  0   }       X   conditional-set  x         subscript  f  1   x   normal-⋯          subscript  f  k   x        0       X=\{x\mid f_{1}(x)=\cdots=f_{k}(x)=0\}   . Define a sheaf of rings on   X   X   X   by letting    𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   be the restriction to   X   X   X   of     𝒪  U   /   (   f  1   ,  …  ,   f  k   )        subscript  𝒪  U     subscript  f  1   normal-…   subscript  f  k      \mathcal{O}_{U}/(f_{1},\ldots,f_{k})   , where    𝒪  U     subscript  𝒪  U    \mathcal{O}_{U}   is the sheaf of holomorphic functions on   U   U   U   . Then the locally ringed   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   -space    (  X  ,   𝒪  X   )     X   subscript  𝒪  X     (X,\mathcal{O}_{X})   is a local model space .  A complex analytic space is a locally ringed   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   -space    (  X  ,   𝒪  X   )     X   subscript  𝒪  X     (X,\mathcal{O}_{X})   which is locally isomorphic to a local model space.  Morphisms of complex analytic spaces are defined to be morphisms of the underlying locally ringed spaces, they are also called holomorphic maps.
