Geometric topology (object)

In mathematics, the geometric topology is a topology one can put on the set H of hyperbolic 3-manifolds of finite volume.
Use
Convergence in this topology is a crucial ingredient of hyperbolic Dehn surgery, a fundamental tool in the theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
Definition
The following is a definition due to Troels Jorgensen:

A sequence 
 
 
 
  in H converges to M in H if there are
 

:* a sequence of positive real numbers 
 
 
 
  converging to 0, and
:* a sequence of 
 
 
 
 -bi-Lipschitz diffeomorphisms



where the domains and ranges of the maps are the 
 
 
 
 -thick parts of either the 
 
 
 
 's or M.
 

Alternate definition
There is an alternate definition due to Mikhail Gromov. Gromov's topology utilizes the Gromov-Hausdorff metric and is defined on pointed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. One essentially considers better and better bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms on larger and larger balls. This results in the same notion of convergence as above as the thick part is always connected; thus, a large ball will eventually encompass all of the thick part.
On framed manifolds
As a further refinement, Gromov's metric can also be defined on framed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. This gives nothing new but this space can be explicitly identified with torsion-free Kleinian groups with the Chabauty topology.
