   Crystallographic point group      Crystallographic point group   In crystallography , a crystallographic point group is a set of symmetry operations, like rotations or reflections, that leave a central point fixed while moving other directions and faces of the crystal to the positions of features of the same kind. For a periodic crystal (as opposed to a quasicrystal ), the group must also be consistent with maintenance of the three-dimensional translational symmetry that defines crystallinity. The macroscopic properties of a crystal would look exactly the same before and after any of the operations in its point group. In the classification of crystals, each point group is also known as a crystal class .  There are infinitely many three-dimensional point groups. However, the crystallographic restriction of the infinite families of general point groups results in there being only 32 crystallographic point groups. These 32 point groups are one-and-the same as the 32 types of morphological (external) crystalline symmetries derived in 1830 by Johann Friedrich Christian Hessel from a consideration of observed crystal forms.  The point group of a crystal, among other things, determines directional variation of the physical properties that arise from its structure, including optical properties such as whether it is birefringent , or whether it shows the Pockels effect .  Notation  The point groups are denoted by their component symmetries. There are a few standard notations used by crystallographers, mineralogists , and physicists .  For the correspondence of the two systems below, see crystal system .  Schoenflies notation  In Schoenflies notation, point groups are denoted by a letter symbol with a subscript. The symbols used in crystallography mean the following:   C n (for cyclic ) indicates that the group has an n -fold rotation axis. C nh is C n with the addition of a mirror (reflection) plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation . C nv is C n with the addition of n mirror planes parallel to the axis of rotation.  S 2n (for Spiegel , German for mirror ) denotes a group that contains only a 2n -fold rotation-reflection axis .  D n (for dihedral , or two-sided) indicates that the group has an n -fold rotation axis plus n twofold axes perpendicular to that axis. D nh has, in addition, a mirror plane perpendicular to the n -fold axis. D nd has, in addition to the elements of D n , mirror planes parallel to the n -fold axis.  The letter T (for tetrahedron ) indicates that the group has the symmetry of a tetrahedron. T d includes improper rotation operations, T excludes improper rotation operations, and T h is T with the addition of an inversion.  The letter O (for octahedron ) indicates that the group has the symmetry of an octahedron (or cube ), with ( O h ) or without ( O ) improper operations (those that change handedness).   Due to the crystallographic restriction theorem , n = 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 in 2- or 3-dimensional space.      n   1   2   3   4   6       C n   C 1   C 2   C 3   C 4   C 6     C nv   C 1v = C 1h   C 2v   C 3v   C 4v   C 6v     C nh   C 1h   C 2h   C 3h   C 4h   C 6h     D n   D 1 = C 2   D 2   D 3   D 4   D 6     D nh   D 1h = C 2v   D 2h   D 3h   D 4h   D 6h     D nd   D 1d = C 2h   D 2d   D 3d   D 4d   D 6d     S 2n   S 2   S 4   S 6   S 8   S 12     D 4d and D 6d are actually forbidden because they contain improper rotations with n=8 and 12 respectively. The 27 point groups in the table plus T , T d , T h , O and O h constitute 32 crystallographic point groups.  Hermann–Mauguin notation  An abbreviated form of the Hermann–Mauguin notation commonly used for space groups also serves to describe crystallographic point groups.
