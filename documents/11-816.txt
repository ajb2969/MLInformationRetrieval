   1-alkenylglycerophosphoethanolamine O-acyltransferase      1-alkenylglycerophosphoethanolamine O-acyltransferase   In enzymology , a 1-alkenylglycerophosphoethanolamine O-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acyl-CoA + 1-alkenylglycerophosphoethanolamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + 1-alkenyl-2-acylglycerophosphoethanolamine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and 1-alkenylglycerophosphoethanolamine , whereas its two products are CoA and 1-alkenyl-2-acylglycerophosphoethanolamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:1-alkenylglycerophosphoethanolamine O-acyltransferase . This enzyme participates in ether lipid metabolism .
