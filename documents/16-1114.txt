Markushevich basis

In geometry, a Markushevich basis (sometimes Markushevich bases1 or M-basis2) is a biorthogonal system that is both complete and total.3 It can be described by the formulation:

Let 
 
 
 
  be Banach space. A biorthogonal system 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is a Markusevich basis if
 
 



and
 
 

 
  separates the points in 
 
 
 
 .


Every Schauder basis of a Banach space is also a Markuschevich basis; the reverse is not true in general. An example of a Markushevich basis that is not a Schauder basis can be the set



in the space 
 
 
 
  of complex continuous functions in [0,1] whose values at 0 and 1 are equal, with the sup norm. It is an open problem whether or not every separable Banach space admits a Markushevich basis with 
 
 
 
 
  for all
