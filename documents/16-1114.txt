   Markushevich basis      Markushevich basis   In geometry , a Markushevich basis (sometimes Markushevich bases 1 or M-basis 2 ) is a biorthogonal system that is both complete and total . 3 It can be described by the formulation:   Let   X   X   X   be Banach space . A biorthogonal system     {   x  α   ;   f  α   }    x   \isin   α      subscript    subscript  x  α    subscript  f  α      x  \isin  α     \{x_{\alpha};f_{\alpha}\}_{x\isin\alpha}   in   X   X   X   is a Markusevich basis if       span  ¯    {   x  α   }    =  X         normal-¯  span     subscript  x  α     X    \overline{\text{span}}\{x_{\alpha}\}=X      and      {   f  α   }    x   \isin   α      subscript    subscript  f  α      x  \isin  α     \{f_{\alpha}\}_{x\isin\alpha}   separates the points in   X   X   X   .    Every Schauder basis of a Banach space is also a Markuschevich basis; the reverse is not true in general. An example of a Markushevich basis that is not a Schauder basis can be the set       {   e   2  i  π  n  t    }    n   \isin   ℤ      subscript    superscript  e    2  i  π  n  t       n  \isin  ℤ     \{e^{2i\pi nt}\}_{n\isin\mathbb{Z}}     in the space     C  ~    [  0  ,  1  ]        normal-~  C    0  1     \tilde{C}[0,1]   of complex continuous functions in [0,1] whose values at 0 and 1 are equal, with the sup norm . It is an open problem whether or not every separable Banach space admits a Markushevich basis with     ∥   x  α   ∥   =   ∥   f  α   ∥   =  1         norm   subscript  x  α     norm   subscript  f  α         1     \|x_{\alpha}\|=\|f_{\alpha}\|=1   for all   α   α   \alpha   . 4  References  "  Category:Functional analysis      ↩  ↩  ↩
