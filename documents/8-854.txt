   Rectangular potential barrier      Rectangular potential barrier   (Figure)  Square potential.png   In quantum mechanics , the rectangular (or, at times, square ) potential barrier is a standard one-dimensional problem that demonstrates the phenomena of wave-mechanical tunneling (also called "quantum tunneling") and wave-mechanical reflection. The problem consists of solving the one-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle encountering a rectangular potential energy barrier. It is usually assumed, as here, that a free particle impinges on the barrier from the left.  Although a particle hypothetically behaving as a point mass would be reflected, a particle actually behaving as a matter wave has a finite probability that it will penetrate the barrier and continue its travel as a wave on the other side. In classical wave-physics, this effect is known as evanescent wave coupling . The likelihood that the particle will pass through the barrier is given by the transmission coefficient , whereas the likelihood that it is reflected is given by the reflection coefficient . Schrödinger's wave-equation allows these coefficients to be calculated.  Calculation  (Figure)  Scattering at a finite potential barrier of height    V  0     subscript  V  0    V_{0}   .

The barrier divides the space in three parts (    E  >   V  0       E   subscript  V  0     E>V_{0}   ). In any of these parts, the potential is constant, meaning that the particle is quasi-free, and the solution of the Schrödinger equation can be written as a superposition of left and right moving waves (see free particle ).

Transmission and reflection  At this point, it is instructive to compare the situation to the classical case. In both cases, the particle behaves as a free particle outside of the barrier region. A classical particle with energy     A  r   =  1       subscript  A  r   1    A_{r}=1   larger than the barrier height     A  l   =  r       subscript  A  l   r    A_{l}=r   would always pass the barrier, and a classical particle with    C  l     subscript  C  l    C_{l}   ). It may be reflected (     C  r   =  t       subscript  C  r   t    C_{r}=t   ) or transmitted (     B  l   ,   B  r       subscript  B  l    subscript  B  r     B_{l},B_{r}   ).

This effect, which differs from the classical case, is called quantum tunneling . The transmission is exponentially suppressed with the barrier width, which can be understood from the functional form of the wave function: Outside of the barrier it oscillates with wave vector    E  ≫   V  0      much-greater-than  E   subscript  V  0     E\gg V_{0}   , whereas within the barrier it is exponentially damped over a distance    r  =  0      r  0    r=0   .

Note that the probabilities and amplitudes as written are for any energy (above/below) the barrier height.  === E = V 0 === The transmission probability at $E=V_0$ evaluates to  $$T=\frac{1}{1+ma^2V_0/ 2\hbar^2}$$ .  Remarks and applications  The calculation presented above may at first seem unrealistic and hardly useful. However it has proved to be a suitable model for a variety of real-life systems. One such example are interfaces between two conducting materials. In the bulk of the materials, the motion of the electrons is quasi-free and can be described by the kinetic term in the above Hamiltonian with an effective mass  $m$ . Often the surfaces of such materials are covered with oxide layers or are not ideal for other reasons. This thin, non-conducting layer may then be modeled by a barrier potential as above. Electrons may then tunnel from one material to the other giving rise to a current.  The operation of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) relies on this tunneling effect. In that case, the barrier is due to the gap between the tip of the STM and the underlying object. Since the tunnel current depends exponentially on the barrier width, this device is extremely sensitive to height variations on the examined sample.  The above model is one-dimensional, while space is three-dimensional. One should solve the Schrödinger equation in three dimensions. On the other hand, many systems only change along one coordinate direction and are translationally invariant along the others; they are separable . The Schrödinger equation may then be reduced to the case considered here by an ansatz for the wave function of the type $$\Psi(x,y,z)=\psi(x)\phi(y,z)$$ .  For another, related model of a barrier, see Delta potential barrier (QM) , which can be regarded as a special case of the finite potential barrier. All results from this article immediately apply to the delta potential barrier's taking the limits $V_0\to\infty,\quad a\to 0$ while keeping $V_0 a=\frac{\lambda^2}{m^2}$ constant.
