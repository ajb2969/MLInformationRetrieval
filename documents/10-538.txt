Glycerol dehydrogenase (NADP+)

  In enzymology, a glycerol dehydrogenase (NADP+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

glycerol + NADP+

 
  D-glyceraldehyde + NADPH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glycerol and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are D-glyceraldehyde, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycerol:NADP+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called glycerol dehydrogenase (NADP+). This enzyme participates in glycerolipid metabolism.
