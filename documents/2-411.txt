   C-symmetry      C-symmetry   In physics , C-symmetry means the symmetry of physical laws under a charge -conjugation transformation . Electromagnetism, gravity and the strong interaction all obey C-symmetry, but weak interactions violate C-symmetry.  Charge reversal in electromagnetism  The laws of electromagnetism (both classical and quantum ) are invariant under this transformation: if each charge q were to be replaced with a charge − q , and thus the directions of the electric and magnetic fields were reversed, the dynamics would preserve the same form. In the language of quantum field theory , charge conjugation transforms: 1       ψ  →   -   i    (    ψ  ¯    γ  0    γ  2    )   T        normal-→  ψ      i   superscript     normal-¯  ψ    superscript  γ  0    superscript  γ  2    T       \psi\rightarrow-i(\bar{\psi}\gamma^{0}\gamma^{2})^{T}          ψ  ¯   →   -   i    (    γ  0    γ  2   ψ   )   T        normal-→   normal-¯  ψ       i   superscript     superscript  γ  0    superscript  γ  2   ψ   T       \bar{\psi}\rightarrow-i(\gamma^{0}\gamma^{2}\psi)^{T}          A  μ   →   -   A  μ       normal-→   superscript  A  μ      superscript  A  μ      A^{\mu}\rightarrow-A^{\mu}      Notice that these transformations do not alter the chirality of particles. A left-handed neutrino would be taken by charge conjugation into a left-handed antineutrino , which does not interact in the Standard Model. This property is what is meant by the "maximal violation" of C-symmetry in the weak interaction.  (Some postulated extensions of the Standard Model , like left-right models , restore this C-symmetry.)  Combination of charge and parity reversal  It was believed for some time that C-symmetry could be combined with the parity -inversion transformation (see P-symmetry ) to preserve a combined CP-symmetry . However, violations of this symmetry have been identified in the weak interactions (particularly in the kaons and B mesons ). In the Standard Model, this CP violation is due to a single phase in the CKM matrix . If CP is combined with time reversal ( T-symmetry ), the resulting CPT-symmetry can be shown using only the Wightman axioms to be universally obeyed.  Charge definition  To give an example, take two real scalar fields, φ and χ . Suppose both fields have even C-parity (even C-parity refers to even symmetry under charge conjugation ex.     C  ψ   (  q  )    =   C  ψ   (   -  q   )          C  ψ  q     C  ψ    q      C\psi(q)=C\psi(-q)   , as opposed to odd C-parity which refers to antisymmetry under charge conjugation ex.     C  ψ   (  q  )    =   -   C  ψ   (   -  q   )           C  ψ  q       C  ψ    q       C\psi(q)=-C\psi(-q)   ). Now reformulate things so that     ψ     =  def      ϕ  +   i  χ     2        superscript   def   ψ      ϕ    i  χ      2      \psi\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ {\phi+i\chi\over\sqrt{2}}   . Now, φ and χ have even C-parities because the imaginary number i has an odd C-parity (C is antiunitary).  In other models, it is possible for both φ and χ to have odd C-parities.
