   Monge array      Monge array   In mathematics applied to computer science , Monge arrays , or Monge matrices , are mathematical objects named for their discoverer, the French mathematician Gaspard Monge .  An m -by- n  matrix is said to be a Monge array if, for all    i  ,  j  ,  k  ,  ℓ     i  j  k  normal-ℓ    \scriptstyle i,\,j,\,k,\,\ell   such that      1  ≤  i  <  k  ≤   m  and  1   ≤  j  <  ℓ  ≤  n        1  i       k         m  and  1        j       normal-ℓ       n     1\leq i     one obtains         A   [  i  ,  j  ]    +   A   [  k  ,  ℓ  ]     ≤    A   [  i  ,  ℓ  ]    +   A   [  k  ,  j  ]      .          A   i  j      A   k  normal-ℓ         A   i  normal-ℓ      A   k  j       A[i,j]+A[k,\ell]\leq A[i,\ell]+A[k,j].\,     So for any two rows and two columns of a Monge array (a 2 × 2 sub-matrix) the four elements at the intersection points have the property that the sum of the upper-left and lower right elements (across the main diagonal ) is less than or equal to the sum of the lower-left and upper-right elements (across the antidiagonal ).  This matrix is a Monge array:      [     10    17    13    28    23      17    22    16    29    23      24    28    22    34    24      11    13    6    17    7      45    44    32    37    23      36    33    19    21    6      75    66    51    53    34     ]      10  17  13  28  23    17  22  16  29  23    24  28  22  34  24    11  13  6  17  7    45  44  32  37  23    36  33  19  21  6    75  66  51  53  34     \begin{bmatrix}10&17&13&28&23\\
 17&22&16&29&23\\
 24&28&22&34&24\\
 11&13&6&17&7\\
 45&44&32&37&23\\
 36&33&19&21&6\\
 75&66&51&53&34\end{bmatrix}     For example, take the intersection of rows 2 and 4 with columns 1 and 5. The four elements are:      [     17    23      11    7     ]      17  23    11  7     \begin{bmatrix}17&23\\
 11&7\end{bmatrix}      17 + 7 = 24  23 + 11 = 34   The sum of the upper-left and lower right elements is less than or equal to the sum of the lower-left and upper-right elements.  Properties   The above definition is equivalent to the statement    A matrix is a Monge array if and only if       A   [  i  ,  j  ]    +   A   [   i  +  1   ,   j  +  1   ]     ≤    A   [  i  ,   j  +  1   ]    +   A   [   i  +  1   ,  j  ]             A   i  j      A     i  1     j  1          A   i    j  1       A     i  1   j       A[i,j]+A[i+1,j+1]\leq A[i,j+1]+A[i+1,j]   for all    1  ≤  i  <  m        1  i       m     1\leq i   and    1  ≤  j  <  n        1  j       n     1\leq j   .    Any subarray produced by selecting certain rows and columns from an original Monge array will itself be a Monge array.    Any linear combination with non-negative coefficients of Monge arrays is itself a Monge array.    One interesting property of Monge arrays is that if you mark with a circle the leftmost minimum of each row, you will discover that your circles march downward to the right; that is to say, if     f   (  x  )    =    arg    min   i  ∈   {  1  ,  …  ,  m  }     A     [  x  ,  i  ]          f  x         subscript     i   1  normal-…  m     A     x  i      f(x)=\arg\min_{i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}}A[x,i]   , then     f   (  j  )    ≤   f   (   j  +  1   )          f  j     f    j  1      f(j)\leq f(j+1)   for all    1  ≤  j  <  n        1  j       n     1\leq j   . Symmetrically, if you mark the uppermost minimum of each column, your circles will march rightwards and downwards. The row and column maxima march in the opposite direction: upwards to the right and downwards to the left.    The notion of weak Monge arrays has been proposed; a weak Monge array is a square n -by- n matrix which satisfies the Monge property      A   [  i  ,  i  ]    +   A   [  r  ,  s  ]     ≤    A   [  i  ,  s  ]    +   A   [  r  ,  i  ]             A   i  i      A   r  s         A   i  s      A   r  i       A[i,i]+A[r,s]\leq A[i,s]+A[r,i]   only for all     1  ≤  i  <  r   ,   s  ≤  n      formulae-sequence      1  i       r      s  n     1\leq i   .  Every Monge array is totally monotone, meaning that its row minima occur in a nondecreasing sequence of columns, and that the same property is true for every subarray. This property allows the row minima to be found quickly by using the SMAWK algorithm .    Monge matrix is just another name for submodular function of two discrete variables. Precisely, A is a Monge matrix if and only if A [ i , j ] is a submodular function of variables i , j .   Applications   A square Monge matrix which is also symmetric about its main diagonal is called a Supnick matrix (after Fred Supnick ); this kind of matrix has applications to the traveling salesman problem (namely, that the problem admits of easy solutions when the distance matrix can be written as a Supnick matrix). Note that any linear combination of Supnick matrices is itself a Supnick matrix.   References     "  Category:Operations research  Category:Theoretical computer science
