   Aldose-1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase      Aldose-1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase   In enzymology , an aldose-1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   NDP + alpha-D-aldose 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phosphate + NDP-aldose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are NDP and alpha-D-aldose 1-phosphate , whereas its two products are phosphate and NDP-aldose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is NDP:alpha-D-aldose-1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase . Other names in common use include sugar-1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase , NDPaldose phosphorylase , glucose 1-phosphate inosityltransferase , NDP sugar phosphorylase , nucleoside diphosphosugar phosphorylase , sugar phosphate nucleotidyltransferase , nucleoside diphosphate sugar:orthophosphate nucleotidyltransferase , sugar nucleotide phosphorylase , and NDP:aldose-1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase . This enzyme participates in nucleotide sugars metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.7.7  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
