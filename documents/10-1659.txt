   Isopiperitenone Delta-isomerase      Isopiperitenone Delta-isomerase   In enzymology , an isopiperitenone Delta-isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   isopiperitenone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   piperitenone   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , isopiperitenone , and one product , piperitenone .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases transposing C=C bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is isopiperitenone Delta8-Delta4-isomerase .  References     "  Category:EC 5.3.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
