Steiner's problem

 Steiner's problem is the problem of finding the maximum of the function


1
It is named after Jakob Steiner.
The maximum is at 
 
 
 
 , where e denotes the base of natural logarithms. One can determine that by solving the equivalent problem of maximizing



The derivative of 
 
 
 
  can be calculated to be



It follows that 
 
 
 
  is positive for 
 
 
 
 , which implies that 
 
 
 
  (and therefore 
 
 
 
 ) increases for 
 
 
 
  Thus, $x=e$ is the unique global maximum of $f(x).$
