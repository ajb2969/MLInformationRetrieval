   Steiner's problem      Steiner's problem    Steiner's problem is the problem of finding the maximum of the function        f   (  x  )    =   x   1  /  x     .        f  x    superscript  x    1  x      f(x)=x^{1/x}.\,    1  It is named after Jakob Steiner .  The maximum is at    x  =  e      x  e    x=e   , where e denotes the base of natural logarithms . One can determine that by solving the equivalent problem of maximizing        g   (  x  )    =    ln  f    (  x  )    =    ln  x   x    .          g  x       f   x            x   x      g(x)=\ln f(x)=\frac{\ln x}{x}.     The derivative of   g   g   g   can be calculated to be         g  ′    (  x  )    =    1  -   ln  x     x  2     .         superscript  g  normal-′   x       1    x     superscript  x  2      g^{\prime}(x)=\frac{1-\ln x}{x^{2}}.     It follows that     g  ′    (  x  )        superscript  g  normal-′   x    g^{\prime}(x)   is positive for    g   (  x  )       g  x    g(x)   , which implies that    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   (and therefore    x  =  e      x  e    x=e   ) increases for     f   (  x  )    .      f  x    f(x).   Thus, $x=e$ is the unique global maximum of $f(x).$  References    "  Category:Functions and mappings  Category:Mathematical optimization     ↩
