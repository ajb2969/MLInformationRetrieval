   (-)-endo-fenchol synthase      (-)-endo-fenchol synthase   In enzymology , a (−)-endo-fenchol synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   geranyl diphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (−)-endo-fenchol + diphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are geranyl diphosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are (−)-endo-fenchol and diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase [cyclizing, (−)-endo-fenchol-forming] . Other names in common use include (−)-endo-fenchol cyclase , and geranyl pyrophosphate:(−)-endo-fenchol cyclase . This enzyme participates in monoterpenoid  biosynthesis .
