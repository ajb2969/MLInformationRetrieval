   Mincer earnings function      Mincer earnings function  The '''Mincer earnings function''' is a single-equation [[Economic model|model]] that explains earnings as a [[Function (mathematics)|fun ction]] of schooling and experience, named after Jacob Mincer . 1 2 The equation has been examined on many datasets and Thomas Lemieux argues it is "one of the most widely used models in empirical economics". Typically the logarithm of earnings is modelled as the sum of years of education and a quadratic function of "years of potential experience". 3 4       ln  y   =    ln   y  0    +   r  S   +    β  1   X   +    β  2    X  2           y        subscript  y  0      r  S      subscript  β  1   X      subscript  β  2    superscript  X  2       \ln y=\ln y_{0}+rS+\beta_{1}X+\beta_{2}X^{2}     Where the variables have the following meanings;   y   y   y   is earnings (    y  0     subscript  y  0    y_{0}   is the earnings of someone with no education and no experience);   S   S   S   is years of schooling;   X   X   X   is years of potential labour market experience. 5  Sherwin Rosen , in his article celebrating Mincer's contribution, memorably noted that when data was interrogated using this equation one might describe them as having been Mincered . 6  References  Further reading       "  Category:Labor economics  Category:Economics models     ↩  Mincer, J.
