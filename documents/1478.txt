   Glutathione—cystine transhydrogenase      Glutathione—cystine transhydrogenase   In enzymology , a glutathione—cystine transhydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 glutathione + cystine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glutathione disulfide + 2 cysteine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glutathione and cystine , whereas its two products are glutathione disulfide and cysteine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with a disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glutathione:cystine oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include GSH-cystine transhydrogenase , and NADPH-dependent GSH-cystine transhydrogenase . This enzyme participates in cysteine metabolism and glutathione metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.8.4  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
