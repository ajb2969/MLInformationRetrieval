Closed convex function




Closed convex function

In mathematics, a function

 
  is said to be closed if for each 
 
 
 
 , the sublevel set

 
  is a closed set.
Equivalently, if the epigraph defined by 
 
 
 
 
  is closed, then the function 
 
 
 
  is closed.
This definition is valid for any function, but most used for convex function. A proper convex function is closed if and only if it is lower semi-continuous. For a convex function which is not proper there is disagreement as to the definition of the closure of the function.
Properties

If 
 
 
 
  is a continuous function and 
 
 
 
  is closed, then 
 
 
 
  is closed.


A closed proper convex function f is the pointwise supremum of the collection of all affine functions h such that h â‰¤ f (called the affine minorants of f).
