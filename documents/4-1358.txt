   Closed convex function      Closed convex function   In mathematics , a function     f  :    ℝ  n   →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  ℝ  n   ℝ     f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   is said to be closed if for each    α  ∈  ℝ      α  ℝ    \alpha\in\mathbb{R}   , the sublevel set     {   x  ∈   dom  f    |    f   (  x  )    ≤  α   }     conditional-set    x    dom  f        f  x   α     \{x\in\mbox{dom}f|f(x)\leq\alpha\}   is a closed set .  Equivalently, if the epigraph defined by     epi  f   =   {    (  x  ,  t  )   ∈   ℝ   n  +  1     |    x  ∈   dom  f    ,    f   (  x  )    ≤  t    }         epi  f    conditional-set     x  t    superscript  ℝ    n  1      formulae-sequence    x    dom  f        f  x   t       \mbox{epi}f=\{(x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^{n+1}|x\in\mbox{dom}f,\;f(x)\leq t\}   is closed, then the function    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   is closed.  This definition is valid for any function, but most used for convex function . A proper convex function is closed if and only if it is lower semi-continuous . For a convex function which is not proper there is disagreement as to the definition of the closure of the function.  Properties   If    f  :    ℝ  n   →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  ℝ  n   ℝ     f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   is a continuous function and    dom  f      dom  f    \mbox{dom}f   is closed, then   f   f   f   is closed.    A closed proper convex function f is the pointwise supremum of the collection of all affine functions  h such that h ≤ f (called the affine minorants of f ).
