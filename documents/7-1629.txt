Bombieri–Vinogradov theorem
In [[mathematics]], the '''Bombieri–Vinogradov theorem''' (sometimes simply called '''Bombieri's theorem''') is a major result of [[analytic number theory]], obtained in the mid-1960s, concerning the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions, averaged over a range of moduli. The first result of this kind was obtained by Mark Barban in 1961{{cite journal |first=

Mat. |volume=22 |year=1961 | mr=0171763 |issue= |pages=1–20 |doi= }} and the Bombieri–Vinogradov theorem is a refinement of Barban's result. The Bombieri–Vinogradov theorem is named after Enrico Bombieri1 and A. I. Vinogradov,2 who published on a related topic, the density hypothesis, in 1965. Perhaps somewhat unjustly, Barban's name is often forgotten.
This result is a major application of the large sieve method, which developed rapidly in the early 1960s, from its beginnings in work of Yuri Linnik two decades earlier. Besides Bombieri, Klaus Roth was working in this area.
Statement of the Bombieri–Vinogradov theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be any two positive real numbers with



Then


 
  is the Euler totient function, which is the number of summands for the modulus q, and


 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes the von Mangoldt function.
A verbal description of this result is that it addresses the error term in the prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions, averaged over the moduli q up to Q. For a certain range of Q, which are around 
 
 
 
  if we neglect logarithmic factors, the error averaged is nearly as small as $\sqrt x$. This is quite unobvious, and without the averaging is about of the strength of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH).
