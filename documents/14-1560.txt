Type-1 OWA operators

The Yager's OWA (ordered weighted averaging) operators1 have been widely used to aggregate the crisp values in decision making schemes (such as multi-criteria decision making, multi-expert decisin making, multi-criteria multi-expert decision making).23 It is widely accepted that fuzzy sets4 are more suitable for representing preferences of criteria in decision making. But fuzzy sets are not crisp values, how can we aggregate fuzzy sets in OWA mechanism?
The type-1 OWA operators56 have been proposed for this purpose. So the type-1 OWA operators provides us with a new technique for directly aggregating uncertain information with uncertain weights via OWA mechanism in soft decision making and data mining, where these uncertain objects are modelled by fuzzy sets.
First, there are two definitions for type-1 OWA operators, one is based on Zadeh's Extension Principle, the other is based on 
 
 
 
 -cuts of fuzzy sets. The two definitions lead to equivalent results.
Definitions
'''Definition 1.7 ''' Let 
 
 
 
  be the set of fuzzy sets with domain of discourse 
 
 
 
 , a type-1 OWA operator is defined as follows:
Given n linguistic weights 
 
 
 
 
  in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse 
 
 
 
 , a type-1 OWA operator is a mapping, 
 
 
 
 ,






such that



where 
 
 
 
 ,and 
 
 
 
  is a permutation function such that 
 
 
 
 , i.e., 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
 
 th highest element in the set 
 
 
 
 .
'''Definition 2.8 '''
The definition below is based on the alpha-cuts of fuzzy sets:
Given the n linguistic weights 
 
 
 
  in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse 
 
 
 
 , then for each 
 
 
 
 , an 
 
 
 
 
 -level type-1 OWA operator with 
 
 
 
 -level sets 
 
 
 
  to aggregate the 
 
 
 
 -cuts of fuzzy sets 
 
 
 
  is given as



where 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is a permutation function such that 
 
 
 
 , i.e., 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
 
 th largest element in the set 
 
 
 
 .
Representation theorem of Type-1 OWA operators9
Given the n linguistic weights 
 
 
 
  in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse 
 
 
 
 , and the fuzzy sets 
 
 
 
 , then we have that10



where 
 
 
 
  is the aggregation result obtained by Definition 1, and 
 
 
 
  is the result obtained by in Definition 2.
Programming problems for Type-1 OWA operators
According to the Representation Theorem of Type-1 OWA Operators,a general type-1 OWA operator can be decomposed into a series of 
 
 
 
 -level type-1 OWA operators. In practice, these series of 
 
 
 
 -level type-1 OWA operators are used to construct the resulting aggregation fuzzy set. So we only need to compute the left end-points and right end-points of the intervals 
 
 
 
 
 . Then, the resulting aggregation fuzzy set is constructed with the membership function as follows:



For the left end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:



while for the right end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:



A fast method has been presented to solve two programming problem so that the type-1 OWA aggregation operation can be performed efficiently, for details, please see the paper.11

Special cases of Type-1 OWA operators

Any OWA operators, like maximum, minimum, mean operators;13
Join operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets,1415 i.e., fuzzy maximum operators;
Meet operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets,1617 i.e., fuzzy minimum operators;
Join-like operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets;1819
Meet-like operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets.2021

Generalizations
Type-2 OWA operators22 have been suggested to aggregate the type-2 fuzzy sets for soft decision making.
