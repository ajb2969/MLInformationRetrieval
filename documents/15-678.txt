   Aqion      Aqion   Aqion is a hydrochemistry software tool. It bridges the gap between scientific software (such like PhreeqC 1 ) and the calculation/handling of "simple" water-related tasks in daily routine practice. The software aqion is free for private users, education and companies.  Motivation & history  First. Most of the hydrochemical software is designed for experts and scientists. In order to flatten the steep learning curve aqion provides an introduction to fundamental water-related topics in form of a "chemical pocket calculator".  Second. The program mediates between two terminological concepts: The calculations are performed in the "scientific realm" of thermodynamics (activities, speciation, log K values, ionic strength, etc.). Then, the output is translated into the "language" of common use: molar and mass concentrations, alkalinity, buffer capacities, water hardness, conductivity and others.  History. Version 1.0 was released in January 2012 (after a half-year test run in 2011). The project is active with 1-2 updates per month.  Features   Validates aqueous solutions (charge balance error, parameter adjustment)  Calculates physico-chemical parameters: alkalinity , buffer capacities ( ANC , BNC), water hardness , ionic strength  Calculates aqueous speciation and complexation  Calculates pH of solutions after addition of chemicals ( acids , bases , salts )  Calculates the calcite-carbonate system (closed/open CO2 system, Langelier Saturation Index )  Calculates mineral dissolution , precipitation , and saturation indices  Calculates mixing of 2 waters  Calculates reduction-oxidation ( redox ) reactions  Plots titration curves   Fields of application   Water analysis and water quality  Geochemical modeling (in simplest form)  Education   Limits of application   only inorganic species (no organic chemistry)  only equilibrium thermodynamics (no chemical kinetics )  only aqueous solutions with ionic strength ≤ 0.7 mol/L 2 (no brines )   Basic algorithm & numerical solver  There are two fundamental approaches in hydrochemistry: Law of mass action (LMA) and Gibbs energy minimization (GEM). 3 The programm aqion belongs to the category LMA approach . In a nutshell: A system of N B independent basis components j (i.e. primary species), that combines to form N S secondary species i , is represented by a set of mass-action and mass-balance equations:  (1)       mass action law:     {  i  }   =     K  i       ∏   j  =  1    N  B       {  j  }    ν   i  ,  j            i      subscript  K  i     superscript   subscript  product    j  1     subscript  N  B     superscript   j    subscript  ν   i  j         \{i\}\,=\,K_{i}\,\prod_{j=1}^{N_{B}}\,\{j\}^{\nu_{i,j}}   with i = 1 ... N S  (2)       mass balance law:       [  j  ]    T  O  T     =    [  j  ]   +     ∑   i  =  1    N  S        ν   i  ,  j      [  i  ]           subscript   delimited-[]  j     T  O  T       delimited-[]  j     superscript   subscript     i  1     subscript  N  S       subscript  ν   i  j     delimited-[]  i        [j]_{TOT}\,=\,[j]+\sum_{i=1}^{N_{S}}\,\nu_{i,j}\,[i]   with j = 1 ... N B  where K i is the equilibrium constant of formation of the secondary species i , and ν i,j represents the stoichiometric coefficient of basis species j in secondary species i (the values of ν j,i can be positive or negative). Here, activities  a i are symbolized by curly brackets {i} while concentrations  c i by rectangular brackets [i]. Both quantities are related by the  (3)       activity correction:     {  i  }   =     γ  i     [  i  ]         i      subscript  γ  i    delimited-[]  i      \{i\}\,=\,\gamma_{i}\,[i]     with γ i as the activity coefficient calculated by the Debye–Hückel equation and/or Davies equation . Inserting Eq.(1) into Eq.(2) yields a nonlinear polynomial function f j for the j- th basis species:  (4)      f  j    (   c  1   ,   c  2   ,  …  ,   c   N  B    )    =     [  j  ]    T  O  T    -   [  j  ]   -    ∑   i  =  1    N  S        ν   i  ,  j     γ  i       K  i      ∏   k  =  1    N  B       {  k  }    ν   i  ,  k          =  0           subscript  f  j     subscript  c  1    subscript  c  2   normal-…   subscript  c   subscript  N  B         subscript   delimited-[]  j     T  O  T     delimited-[]  j     subscript   superscript    subscript  N  S      i  1         subscript  ν   i  j     subscript  γ  i     subscript  K  i     subscript   superscript  product   subscript  N  B      k  1     superscript   k    subscript  ν   i  k              0     f_{j}(c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{N_{B}})\,=\,[j]_{TOT}-[j]-\sum^{N_{S}}_{i=1}\frac{\nu%
 _{i,j}}{\gamma_{i}}\,K_{i}\,\prod^{N_{B}}_{k=1}\{k\}^{\nu_{i,k}}\,=\,0     which is the objective function of the Newton–Raphson method .  To solve Eq.(4) aqion adopts the numerical solver from the open-source software PhreeqC . 4 5 The equilibrium constants  K i are taken from the thermodynamic database wateq4f . 6  Examples, test & verification  The software aqion is shipped with a set of example solutions (input waters) and a tutorial how to attack typical water-related problems (online-manual with about 40 examples). More examples and exercises for testing and re-run can be found in classical textbooks of hydrochemistry. 7 8 9  The program was verified by benchmark tests of specific industry standards. 10  Screenshots  File:Aqion_input_panel_3.5.png|Input panel for chemical elements File:aqion pH calculator.jpg|Output of pH calculator (example) File:Aqion_calcite_carbonate_system_3.5.png|Calculated parameters of the calcite carbonate system File:Titration NaOH.gif|titration curves (example: addition of NaOH to a given input water)  References  External links   PHREEQC   "  Category:Chemistry software  Category:Computational chemistry software  Category:Science education software     Parkhurst, D.L. and C.A.J.
