Phosphatidylcholine desaturase

In enzymology, a phosphatidylcholine desaturase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1-acyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine + NAD+

 
  1-acyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-acyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are 1-acyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-acyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine:NAD+ Delta12-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include oleate desaturase, linoleate synthase, oleoyl-CoA desaturase, and oleoylphosphatidylcholine desaturase.
