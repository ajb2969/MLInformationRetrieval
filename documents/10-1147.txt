   Thymine dioxygenase      Thymine dioxygenase   In enzymology , a thymine dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   thymine + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-hydroxymethyluracil + succinate + CO 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are thymine , 2-oxoglutarate , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 5-hydroxymethyluracil , succinate , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is thymine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (7-hydroxylating) . Other names in common use include thymine 7-hydroxylase , 5-hydroxy-methyluracil dioxygenase , and 5-hydroxymethyluracil oxygenase . It has 2 cofactors : iron , and Ascorbate .
