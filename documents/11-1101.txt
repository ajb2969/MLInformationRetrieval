   Methionine—glyoxylate transaminase      Methionine—glyoxylate transaminase   In enzymology , a methionine-glyoxylate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-methionine + glyoxylate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoate + glycine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-methionine and glyoxylate , whereas its two products are 4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoate and glycine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-methionine:glyoxylate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include methionine-glyoxylate aminotransferase , and MGAT .
