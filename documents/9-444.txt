   Prandtl–Meyer function      Prandtl–Meyer function   (Figure)  Varition in the Prandtl–Meyer function (   ν   ν   \nu   ) with Mach number (   M   M   M   ) and ratio of specific heat capacity (   γ   γ   \gamma   ). The dashed lines show the limiting value    ν  max     subscript  ν  max    \nu_{\text{max}}   as Mach number tends to infinity.   Prandtl–Meyer function describes the angle through which a flow can turn isentropically for the given initial and final Mach number . It is the maximum angle through which a sonic ( M = 1) flow can be turned around a convex corner. For an ideal gas , it is expressed as follows,      ν   (  M  )       ν  M    \displaystyle\nu(M)     where,    ν    ν   \nu\,   is the Prandtl–Meyer function,   M   M   M   is the Mach number of the flow and   γ   γ   \gamma   is the ratio of the specific heat capacities .  By convention, the constant of integration is selected such that     ν   (  1  )    =   0.         ν  1   0.    \nu(1)=0.\,     As Mach number varies from 1 to   ∞     \infty   ,    ν    ν   \nu\,   takes values from 0 to     ν  max      subscript  ν  max    \nu_{\text{max}}\,   , where       ν  max   =    π  2    (      γ  +  1    γ  -  1     -  1   )         subscript  ν  max       π  2           γ  1     γ  1     1      \nu_{\text{max}}=\frac{\pi}{2}\bigg(\sqrt{\frac{\gamma+1}{\gamma-1}}-1\bigg)         For isentropic expansion,        ν   (   M  2   )    =    ν   (   M  1   )    +   θ          ν   subscript  M  2        ν   subscript  M  1    θ     \nu(M_{2})=\nu(M_{1})+\theta\,        For isentropic compression,        ν   (   M  2   )    =    ν   (   M  1   )    -   θ          ν   subscript  M  2        ν   subscript  M  1    θ     \nu(M_{2})=\nu(M_{1})-\theta\,          where,   θ   θ   \theta   is the absolute value of the angle through which the flow turns,   M   M   M   is the flow Mach number and the suffixes "1" and "2" denote the initial and final conditions respectively.
