   Lysine—pyruvate 6-transaminase      Lysine—pyruvate 6-transaminase   In enzymology , a lysine-pyruvate 6-transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-lysine + pyruvate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-2-aminoadipate 6-semialdehyde + L-alanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-lysine and pyruvate , whereas its two products are L-2-aminoadipate 6-semialdehyde and L-alanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-lysine:pyruvate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include lysine-pyruvate aminotransferase , and Lys-AT .
