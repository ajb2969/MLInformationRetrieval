4,5-dihydroxyphthalate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4,5-dihydroxyphthalate 
 
 
 
  3,4-dihydroxybenzoate + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate, and two products, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate carboxy-lyase (3,4-dihydroxybenzoate-forming). This enzyme is also called 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate carboxy-lyase. This enzyme participates in 2,4-dichlorobenzoate degradation.
