Signature operator

In mathematics, the signature operator is an elliptic differential operator defined on a certain subspace of the space of differential forms on an even-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold, whose analytic index is the same as the topological signature of the manifold if the dimension of the manifold is a multiple of four.1 It is an instance of a Dirac-type operator.
Definition in the even-dimensional case
Let 
 
 
 
  be a compact Riemannian manifold of even dimension 
 
 
 
 . Let



be the exterior derivative on 
 
 
 
 -th order differential forms on 
 
 
 
 . The Riemannian metric on 
 
 
 
  allows us to define the Hodge star operator

 
  and with it the inner product



on forms. Denote by



the adjoint operator of the exterior differential 
 
 
 
 . This operator can be expressed purely in terms of the Hodge star operator as follows:



Now consider 
 
 
 
  acting on the space of all forms 
 
 
 
 . One way to consider this as a graded operator is the following: Let 
 
 
 
  be an involution on the space of all forms defined by:



It is verified that 
 
 
 
  anti-commutes with 
 
 
 
  and, consequently, switches the 
 
 
 
 -eigenspaces

 
  of 
 
 

Consequently,



Definition: The operator 
 
 
 
  with the above grading respectively the above operator 
 
 
 
  is called the signature operator of 
 
 
 
 .2
Definition in the odd-dimensional case
In the odd-dimensional case one defines the signature operator to be 
 
 
 
  acting on the even-dimensional forms of 
 
 
 
 .
Hirzebruch Signature Theorem
If 
 
 
 
 , so that the dimension of 
 
 
 
  is a multiple of four, then Hodge theory implies that:



where the right hand side is the topological signature (i.e. the signature of a quadratic form on 
 
 
 
  defined by the cup product).
The Heat Equation approach to the Atiyah-Singer index theorem can then be used to show that:



where 
 
 
 
  is the Hirzebruch L-Polynomial,3 and the 
 
 
 
  the Pontrjagin forms on 
 
 
 
 .4
Homotopy invariance of the higher indices
Kaminker and Miller proved that the higher indices of the signature operator are homotopy-invariant.5
