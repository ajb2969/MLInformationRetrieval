Heat current

A heat current is a kinetic exchange rate between molecules, relative to the material in which the kinesis occurs. It is defined as 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is heat and 
 
 
 
  is time.
For conduction, heat current is defined by Fourier's law as


 
  where


 
  is the amount of heat transferred per unit time [W] and





 
  is an oriented surface area element [m2]
 

The above differential equation, when integrated for a homogeneous material of 1-D geometry between two endpoints at constant temperature, gives the heat flow rate as:


 
  where

A is the cross-sectional surface area,
 


 
  is the temperature difference between the ends,
 


 
  is the distance between the ends.
 

For thermal radiation, heat current is defined as


 
  where the constant of proportionality

 
  is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, 
 
 
 
  is the radiating surface area, and 
 
 
 
  is temperature.
Heat current can also be thought of as the total phonon distribution multiplied by the energy of one phonon, times the group velocity of the phonons. The phonon distribution of a particular phonon mode is given by the Bose-Einstein factor, which is dependent on temperature and phonon energy.
