   Heat current      Heat current   A heat current is a kinetic exchange rate between molecules , relative to the material in which the kinesis occurs. It is defined as     d  Q    d  t         d  Q     d  t     \frac{dQ}{dt}   , where   Q   Q   Q   is heat and   t   t   t   is time .  For conduction , heat current is defined by Fourier's law as        ∂  Q    ∂  t    =   -   k    ∮  S      ∇  →   T   ⋅    d  S   →               Q     t        k    subscript  contour-integral  S    normal-⋅     normal-→  normal-∇   T    normal-→    d  S          \frac{\partial Q}{\partial t}=-k\oint_{S}{\overrightarrow{\nabla}T\cdot\,%
 \overrightarrow{dS}}   where      .    ∂  Q    ∂  t    .     fragments  normal-.

Δ  Q    Δ  t    =  -  k  A    Δ  T    Δ  x       fragments  normal-.      normal-Δ  Q     normal-Δ  t      k  A      normal-Δ  T     normal-Δ  x      \big.\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}=-kA\frac{\Delta T}{\Delta x}   where   A is the cross-sectional surface area,      Δ  T      normal-Δ  T    \Delta T   is the temperature difference between the ends,      Δ  x      normal-Δ  x    \Delta x   is the distance between the ends.   For thermal radiation , heat current is defined as      W  =   σ  ⋅  A  ⋅   T  4        W   normal-⋅  σ  A   superscript  T  4      W=\sigma\cdot A\cdot T^{4}   where the constant of proportionality    σ   σ   \sigma   is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant ,   A   A   A   is the radiating surface area, and   T   T   T   is temperature.  Heat current can also be thought of as the total phonon distribution multiplied by the energy of one phonon, times the group velocity of the phonons . The phonon distribution of a particular phonon mode is given by the Bose-Einstein factor, which is dependent on temperature and phonon energy.
