   Sinusoidal spiral      Sinusoidal spiral   In geometry , the sinusoidal spirals are a family of curves defined by the equation in polar coordinates       r  n   =    a  n    cos   (   n  θ   )          superscript  r  n      superscript  a  n       n  θ       r^{n}=a^{n}\cos(n\theta)\,     where a is a nonzero constant and n is a rational number other than 0. With a rotation about the origin, this can also be written        r  n   =    a  n    sin   (   n  θ   )      .       superscript  r  n      superscript  a  n       n  θ       r^{n}=a^{n}\sin(n\theta).\,     The term "spiral" is a misnomer, because they are not actually spirals, and often have a flower-like shape. Many well known curves are sinusoidal spirals including:   Equilateral hyperbola ( n = −2)  Line ( n = −1)  Parabola ( n = −1/2)  Tschirnhausen cubic ( n = −1/3)  Cayley's sextet ( n = 1/3)  Cardioid ( n = 1/2)  Circle ( n = 1)  Lemniscate of Bernoulli ( n = 2)   The curves were first studied by Colin Maclaurin .  Equations  Differentiating       r  n   =    a  n    cos   (   n  θ   )          superscript  r  n      superscript  a  n       n  θ       r^{n}=a^{n}\cos(n\theta)\,   and eliminating a produces a differential equation for r and θ:          d  r    d  θ     cos   n  θ     +   r   sin   n  θ      =  0              d  r     d  θ        n  θ       r      n  θ      0    \frac{dr}{d\theta}\cos n\theta+r\sin n\theta=0   .  Then        (    d  r    d  s    ,   r    d  θ    d  s     )    cos   n  θ    d  s    d  θ       =   (   -   r   sin   n  θ      ,   r   cos   n  θ     )   =   r   (   -   sin   n  θ     ,   cos   n  θ    )                 d  r     d  s      r      d  θ     d  s          n  θ      d  s     d  θ            r      n  θ        r      n  θ             r         n  θ         n  θ         \left(\frac{dr}{ds},\ r\frac{d\theta}{ds}\right)\cos n\theta\frac{ds}{d\theta}%
 =\left(-r\sin n\theta,\ r\cos n\theta\right)=r\left(-\sin n\theta,\ \cos n%
 \theta\right)   which implies that the polar tangential angle is      ψ  =    n  θ   ±   π  /  2        ψ   plus-or-minus    n  θ     π  2      \psi=n\theta\pm\pi/2   and so the tangential angle is      φ  =     (   n  +  1   )   θ   ±   π  /  2        φ   plus-or-minus      n  1   θ     π  2      \varphi=(n+1)\theta\pm\pi/2   . (The sign here is positive if r and cos n θ have the same sign and negative otherwise.)  The unit tangent vector,      (    d  r    d  s    ,   r    d  θ    d  s     )         d  r     d  s      r      d  θ     d  s       \left(\frac{dr}{ds},\ r\frac{d\theta}{ds}\right)   , has length one, so comparing the magnitude of the vectors on each side of the above equation gives        d  s    d  θ    =   r    cos   -  1     n  θ     =   a    cos    -  1   +    1  n       n  θ               d  s     d  θ      r    superscript     1      n  θ            a    superscript       1     1  n       n  θ        \frac{ds}{d\theta}=r\cos^{-1}n\theta=a\cos^{-1+\tfrac{1}{n}}n\theta   . In particular, the length of a single loop when    n  >  0      n  0    n>0   is:      a    ∫   -    π   2  n        π   2  n        cos    -  1   +    1  n       n   θ   d  θ         a    superscript   subscript       π    2  n        π    2  n       superscript       1     1  n       n  θ  d  θ       a\int_{-\tfrac{\pi}{2n}}^{\tfrac{\pi}{2n}}\cos^{-1+\tfrac{1}{n}}n\theta\ d\theta     The curvature is given by        d  φ    d  s    =    (   n  +  1   )     d  θ    d  s     =     n  +  1   a     cos   1  -    1  n       n  θ               d  φ     d  s        n  1       d  θ     d  s                n  1   a     superscript     1    1  n       n  θ        \frac{d\varphi}{ds}=(n+1)\frac{d\theta}{ds}=\frac{n+1}{a}\cos^{1-\tfrac{1}{n}}n\theta   .  Properties  The inverse of a sinusoidal spiral with respect to a circle with center at the origin is another sinusoidal spiral whose value of n is the negative of the original curve's value of n . For example, the inverse of the lemniscate of Bernoulli is a hyperbola.  The isoptic , pedal and negative pedal of a sinusoidal spiral are different sinusoidal spirals.  One path of a particle moving according to a central force proportional to a power of r is a sinusoidal spiral.  When n is an integer, and n points are arranged regularly on a circle of radius a , then the set of points so that the geometric mean of the distances from the point to the n points is a sinusoidal spiral. In this case the sinusoidal spiral is a polynomial lemniscate  References   Yates, R. C.: A Handbook on Curves and Their Properties , J. W.
