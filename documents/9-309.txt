Zonal polynomial

In mathematics, a zonal polynomial is a multivariate symmetric homogeneous polynomial. The zonal polynomials form a basis of the space of symmetric polynomials.
They appear as zonal spherical functions of the Gelfand pairs

 
  (here, 
 
 
 
  is the hyperoctahedral group) and 
 
 
 
 , which means that they describe canonical basis of the double class algebras 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
They are applied in multivariate statistics.
The zonal polynomials are the 
 
 
 
  case of the C normalization of the Jack function.
