Rank factorization

Given an 
 
 
matrix

 
  of rank

 
 , a rank decomposition or rank factorization of 
 
 
 
  is a product 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
  matrix and 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
  matrix.
Every finite-dimensional matrix has a rank decomposition: Let 
 
 
 
  be an 
 
 
 
  matrix whose column rank is 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, there are 
 
 
linearly independent columns in 
 
 
 
 ; equivalently, the dimension of the column space of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be any basis for the column space of 
 
 
 
  and place them as column vectors to form the 
 
 
 
  matrix 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, every column vector of 
 
 
 
  is a linear combination of the columns of 
 
 
 
 . To be precise, if 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
  matrix with 
 
 
 
  as the 
 
 
 
 -th column, then


 
  where 
 
 
 
 's are the scalar coefficients of 
 
 
 
  in terms of the basis 
 
 
 
 . This implies that 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
 -th element of 
 
 
 
 .
== rank(A) = rank(AT) == An immediate consequence of rank factorization is that the rank of 
 
 
 
  is equal to the rank of its transpose 
 
 
 
 . Since the columns of 
 
 
 
  are the rows of 
 
 
 
 , the column rank of 
 
 
 
  equals its row rank.
Proof: To see why this is true, let us first define rank to mean column rank. Since 
 
 
 
 , it follows that 
 
 
 
 . From the definition of matrix multiplication, this means that each column of 
 
 
 
  is a linear combination of the columns of 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, the column space of 
 
 
 
  is contained within the column space of 
 
 
 
  and, hence, rank(
 
 
 
 ) ≤ rank(
 
 
 
 ). Now, 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 ×
 
 
 
 , so there are 
 
 
 
  columns in 
 
 
 
  and, hence, rank(
 
 
 
 ) ≤ 
 
 
 
  = rank(
 
 
 
 ). This proves that rank(
 
 
 
  ≤ rank(
 
 
 
 ). Now apply the result to 
 
 
 
  to obtain the reverse inequality: since 
 
 
 
  = 
 
 
 
 , we can write rank(
 
 
 
 ) = rank(
 
 
 
  ≤ rank(
 
 
 
 ). This proves rank(
 
 
 
  ≤ rank(
 
 
 
 ). We have, therefore, proved rank(
 
 
 
  ≤ rank(
 
 
 
 ) and rank(
 
 
 
 ) ≤ rank(
 
 
 
 ), so rank(
 
 
 
 ) = rank(
 
 
 
 ). (Also see the first proof of column rank = row rank under rank).
Rank factorization from row echelon forms
In practice, we can construct one specific rank factorization as follows: we can compute 
 
 
 
 , the reduced row echelon form of 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is obtained by removing from 
 
 
 
  all non-pivot columns, and 
 
 
 
  by eliminating all zero rows of 
 
 
 
 .
Example
Consider the matrix



 
  is in reduced echelon form. Then 
 
 
 
  is obtained by removing the third column of 
 
 
 
 , the only one which is not a pivot column, and 
 
 
 
  by getting rid of the last row of zeroes, so


 
  It is straightforward to check that



Proof
Let 
 
 
 
  be an 
 
 
 
  permutation matrix such that 
 
 
 
  in block partitioned form, where the columns of 
 
 
 
  are the 
 
 
 
  pivot columns of 
 
 
 
 . Every column of 
 
 
 
  is a linear combination of the columns of 
 
 
 
 , so there is a matrix 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , where the columns of 
 
 
 
  contain the coefficients of each of those linear combinations. So 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  being the 
 
 
 
  identity matrix. We will show now that 
 
 
 
 .
Transforming 
 
 
 
  into its reduced row echelon form amounts to left-multiplying by a matrix 
 
 
 
  which is a product of elementary matrices, so 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 . We then can write 
 
 
 
 , which allows us to identify 
 
 
 
 , i.e. the nonzero 
 
 
 
  rows of the reduced echelon form, with the same permutation on the columns as we did for 
 
 
 
 . We thus have 
 
 
 
 , and since 
 
 
 
  is invertible this implies 
 
 
 
 , and the proof is complete.
