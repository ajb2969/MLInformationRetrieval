Zhi-Wei Sun (, born October 16, 1965) is a Chinese mathematician, working primarily on number theory, combinatorics, and group theory. Currently he works as a professor in Nanjing University.
Born in Huai'an, Jiangsu, Sun and his twin brother Sun Zhihong proved a theorem about what are now known as the Wall-Sun-Sun primes that guided the search for counterexamples to Fermat's last theorem.
In 2003, he presented a unified approach to three famous topics of Paul Erdős in combinatorial number theory: covering systems, restricted sumsets, and zero-sum problems or EGZ Theorem.1
He used q-series to prove that any natural number can be represented as a sum of an even square and two triangular numbers. He conjectured, and proved with B.-K. Oh, that each positive integer can be represented as a sum of a square, an odd square and a triangular number.2 In 2009, he conjectured that any natural number can be written as the sum of two squares and a pentagonal number, as the sum of a triangular number, an even square and a pentagonal number, and as the sum of a square, a pentagonal number and a hexagonal number.3 He also raised many open conjectures on congruences 4 and posed over 100 conjectural series for powers of 
 
 
 
 .5
In 2013 he published a paper 6 containing many conjectures on primes one of which states that for any positive integer 
 
 
 
  there are consecutive primes 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the 
 
 
 
 -th prime.
His Erdős number is 2. He is the Editor-in-Chief of Journal of Combinatorics and Number Theory.
