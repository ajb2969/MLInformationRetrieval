   Degree distribution      Degree distribution   In the study of graphs and networks , the degree of a node in a network is the number of connections it has to other nodes and the degree distribution is the probability distribution of these degrees over the whole network.  Definition  The degree of a node in a network (sometimes referred to incorrectly as the connectivity ) is the number of connections or edges the node has to other nodes. If a network is directed , meaning that edges point in one direction from one node to another node, then nodes have two different degrees, the in-degree, which is the number of incoming edges, and the out-degree, which is the number of outgoing edges.  The degree distribution P ( k ) of a network is then defined to be the fraction of nodes in the network with degree k . Thus if there are n nodes in total in a network and n k of them have degree k , we have P ( k ) = n k / n .  The same information is also sometimes presented in the form of a cumulative degree distribution , the fraction of nodes with degree greater than or equal to k .  Observed degree distributions  The degree distribution is very important in studying both real networks, such as the Internet and social networks , and theoretical networks. The simplest network model, for example, the (Bernoulli) random graph , in which each of n nodes is connected (or not) with independent probability p (or 1 − p ), has a binomial distribution of degrees k :        P   (  k  )    =    (      n  -  1       k     )    p  k     (   1  -  p   )    n  -  1  -  k      ,        P  k      binomial    n  1   k    superscript  p  k    superscript    1  p     n  1  k       P(k)={n-1\choose k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-1-k},     (or Poisson in the limit of large n ). Most networks in the real world, however, have degree distributions very different from this. Most are highly right-skewed, meaning that a large majority of nodes have low degree but a small number, known as "hubs", have high degree. Some networks, notably the Internet, the world wide web , and some social networks are found to have degree distributions that approximately follow a power law : P ( k ) ~ k − γ , where γ is a constant. Such networks are called scale-free networks and have attracted particular attention for their structural and dynamical properties.
