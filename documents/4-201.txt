   Syntactic monoid      Syntactic monoid   In mathematics and computer science , the syntactic monoid  M ( L ) of a formal language  L is the smallest monoid that recognizes the language L .  Syntactic quotient  Given    S  ⊂  M      S  M    S\subset M   of a monoid M of every string over some alphabet, one may define sets that consist of formal left or right inverses of elements in S . These are called quotients , and one may define right or left quotients, depending on which side one is concatenating. Thus, the right quotient of S by an element    m  ∈  M      m  M    m\in M   is the set         S   /  m   =   {   u  ∈   M    |    u  m   ∈  S   }    .        S  m    conditional-set    u  M       u  m   S      S\ /\ m=\{u\in M\;|\;um\in S\}.     Similarly, the left quotient is        m  ∖  S   =   {   u  ∈   M    |    m  u   ∈  S   }    .        m  S    conditional-set    u  M       m  u   S      m\setminus S=\{u\in M\;|\;mu\in S\}.     Syntactic equivalence  The syntactic quotient induces an equivalence relation on M , called the syntactic relation , or syntactic equivalence (induced by S ). The right syntactic equivalence is the equivalence relation        ∼  S    =   {   (  s  ,  t  )   ∈  M  ×   M   |   S   /  s  =   S   /  t  }   .     fragments   subscript  similar-to  S     fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-(  s  normal-,  t  normal-)    M   M  normal-|  S   s   S   t  normal-}   normal-.    \sim_{S}\;=\{(s,t)\in M\times M\,|\;S\ /\ s=S\ /\ t\}.     Similarly, the left syntactic relation is        ∼   S     =   {   (  s  ,  t  )   ∈  M  ×   M   |  s  ∖  S  =  t  ∖  S  }   .     fragments   subscript  similar-to  S     fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-(  s  normal-,  t  normal-)    M   M  normal-|  s   S   t   S  normal-}   normal-.    \,{}_{S}\sim\;=\{(s,t)\in M\times M\,|\;s\setminus S=t\setminus S\}.     The syntactic congruence or Myhill congruence 1 may be defined as 2      u   ≡  S   v  ⇔  ∀  x  ,  y  ∈  M   (  x  u  y  ∈  S  ⇔  x  v  y  ∈  S  )   .     fragments  u   subscript   S   v  normal-⇔  for-all  x  normal-,  y   M   fragments  normal-(  x  u  y   S  normal-⇔  x  v  y   S  normal-)   normal-.    u\equiv_{S}v\Leftrightarrow\forall x,y\in M(xuy\in S\Leftrightarrow xvy\in S).     The definition extends to a congruence defined by a subset S of a general monoid M . A disjunctive set is a subset S such that the syntactic congruence defined by S is the equality relation. 3  Syntactic monoid  The syntactic quotient is compatible with concatenation in the monoid, in that one has        (    M   /  s   )   /  t   =    M   /   (   t  s   )            M  s   t     M    t  s      (M\ /\ s)\ /\ t=M\ /\ (ts)     for all     s  ,  t   ∈  M       s  t   M    s,t\in M   (and similarly for the left quotient). Thus, the syntactic quotient is a monoid morphism , and induces a quotient monoid      M   (  S  )   =   M   /   ∼  S   .     fragments  M   fragments  normal-(  S  normal-)    M    subscript  similar-to  S   normal-.    M(S)=M\ /\ \sim_{S}.     This monoid    M   (  S  )       M  S    M(S)   is called the syntactic monoid of S . It can be shown that it is the smallest monoid that recognizes  S ; that is, M ( S ) recognizes S , and for every monoid N recognizing S , M ( S ) is a quotient of a submonoid of N . The syntactic monoid of S is also the transition monoid of the minimal automaton of S . 4 5 6  Similarly, a language L is regular if and only if the family of quotients      {   m  ∖   L    |   m  ∈  M   }     conditional-set    m  L     m  M     \{m\setminus L\,|\;m\in M\}     is finite. 7 The proof showing equivalence is quite easy. Assume that a string x is read by a deterministic finite automaton , with the machine proceeding into state p . If y is another string read by the machine, also terminating in the same state p , then clearly one has     x  ∖   L    =   y  ∖  L         x  L     y  L     x\setminus L\,=y\setminus L   . Thus, the number of elements in    {   m  ∖   L    |   m  ∈  M   }     conditional-set    m  L     m  M     \{m\setminus L\,|\;m\in M\}   is just exactly equal to the number of states of the automaton and    {   m  ∖   L    |   m  ∈  L   }     conditional-set    m  L     m  L     \{m\setminus L\,|\;m\in L\}   is equal to number of final states. Assume the converse: that the number of elements in    {   m  ∖   L    |   m  ∈  M   }     conditional-set    m  L     m  M     \{m\setminus L\,|\;m\in M\}   is finite. One can then construct an automaton where    Q  =   {   m  ∖   L    |   m  ∈  M   }       Q   conditional-set    m  L     m  M      Q=\{m\setminus L\,|\;m\in M\}   is the set of states,    F  =   {   m  ∖   L    |   m  ∈  L   }       F   conditional-set    m  L     m  L      F=\{m\setminus L\,|\;m\in L\}   is the set of final states, the language L is the initial state, and the transition function is given by     y  ∖   (   x  ∖  L   )    =    (   x  y   )   ∖  L         y    x  L        x  y   L     y\setminus(x\setminus L)=(xy)\setminus L   . Clearly, this automaton recognizes L . Thus, a language L is recognizable if and only if the set    {   m  ∖   L    |   m  ∈  M   }     conditional-set    m  L     m  M     \{m\setminus L\,|\;m\in M\}   is finite.  Given a regular expression  E representing S , it is easy to compute the syntactic monoid of S .  A group language is one for which the syntactic monoid is a group . 8  Examples   Let L be the language over A = { a , b } of words of even length. The syntactic congruence has two classes, L itself and L 1 , the words of odd length. The syntactic monoid is the group of order 2 on { L , L 1 }. 9  The bicyclic monoid is the syntactic monoid of the Dyck language (the language of balanced sets of parentheses).  The free monoid on A is the syntactic monoid of the language { ww R | w in A * }, where w R denotes the reversal of word w .  Every finite monoid is homomorphic to the syntactic monoid of some non-trivial language, 10 but not every finite monoid is isomorphic to a syntactic monoid. 11  Every finite group is isomorphic to the syntactic monoid of some non-trivial language. 12  The language over { a , b } in which the number of occurrences of a and b are congruent modulo 2 n is a group language with syntactic monoid Z /2 n . 13  Trace monoids are examples of syntactic monoids.  Marcel-Paul Schützenberger 14 characterized star-free languages as those with finite aperiodic syntactic monoids. 15   References          "  Category:Formal languages  Category:Semigroup theory     Holcombe (1982) p.160 ↩  Lawson (2004) p.210 ↩  Lawson (2004) p.232 ↩    Straubing (1994) p.55 ↩  Holcombe (1982) p.160 ↩  Sakarovitch (2009) p.342 ↩  Straubing (1994) p.54 ↩  ↩  Lawson (2004) p.233 ↩    ↩  Straubing (1994) p.60 ↩
