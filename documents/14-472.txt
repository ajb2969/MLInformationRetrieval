   Orchard-planting problem      Orchard-planting problem   (Figure)  An arrangement of nine points forming ten 3-point lines.   In discrete geometry , the original orchard-planting problem asks for the maximum number of 3-point lines attainable by a configuration of points in the plane. It is also called the tree-planting problem or simply the orchard problem. There are also investigations into how many k-point lines there can be. Hallard T. Croft and Paul Erdős proved t k > c  n 2 / k 3 , where n is the number of points and t k is the number of k -point lines. 1 Their construction contains some m-point lines, where m > k. One can also ask the question if these are not allowed.  Integer sequence  Define t 3 orchard ( n ) to be the maximum number of 3-point lines attainable with a configuration of n points. For an arbitrary number of points, n , t 3 orchard ( n ) was shown to be (1/6) n 2 − O(n) in 1974.  The first few values of t 3 orchard ( n ) are given in the following table .      n   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   12   13   14       t 3 orchard ( n )   1   2   4   6   7   10   12   16   19   22   26     Upper and lower bounds  Since no two lines may share two distinct points, a trivial upper-bound for the number of 3-point lines determined by n points is        ⌊    (     n      2     )   /   (     3      2     )    ⌋   =   ⌊     n  2   -  n   6   ⌋    .           binomial  n  2    binomial  3  2            superscript  n  2   n   6      \left\lfloor{\left({{n}\atop{2}}\right)}\Big/{\left({{3}\atop{2}}\right)}%
 \right\rfloor=\left\lfloor\frac{n^{2}-n}{6}\right\rfloor.   Using the fact that the number of 2-point lines is at least 6 n /13 , this upper bound can be lowered to        ⌊     (      n      2      )   -    6  n   /  13    3   ⌋   =   ⌊     n  2   6   -    25  n   78    ⌋    .             binomial  n  2       6  n   13    3           superscript  n  2   6       25  n   78       \left\lfloor\frac{{\left({{n}\atop{2}}\right)}-6n/13}{3}\right\rfloor=\left%
 \lfloor\frac{n^{2}}{6}-\frac{25n}{78}\right\rfloor.     Lower bounds for t 3 orchard ( n ) are given by constructions for sets of points with many 3-point lines. The earliest quadratic lower bound of ~(1/8) n 2 was given by Sylvester , who placed n points on the cubic curve y = x 3 . This was improved to [(1/6) n 2 − (1/2) n ] + 1 in 1974 by , using a construction based on Weierstrass's elliptic functions . An elementary construction using hypocycloids was found by  achieving the same lower bound.  In September 2013, Ben Green and Terence Tao published a paper in which they prove that for all point sets of sufficient size, n > n 0 , there are at most ([ n ( n - 3)/6]  + 1) = [(1/6) n 2 − (1/2) n + 1] 3-point lines which matches the lower bound established by Burr, Grünbaum and Sloane. 2 This is slightly better than the bound that would directly follow from their tight lower bound of n /2 for the number of 2-point lines : [ n ( n − 2)/6], proved in the same paper and solving a 1951 problem posed independently by Gabriel Andrew Dirac and Theodore Motzkin .
