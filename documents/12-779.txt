   Maximising measure      Maximising measure   In mathematics — specifically, in ergodic theory — a maximising measure is a particular kind of probability measure . Informally, a probability measure μ is a maximising measure for some function f if the integral of f with respect to μ is “as big as it can be”. The theory of maximising measures is relatively young and quite little is known about their general structure and properties.  Definition  Let X be a topological space and let T : X → X be a continuous function . Let Inv( T ) denote the set of all Borel probability measures on X that are invariant under T , i.e., for every Borel-measurable subset A of X , μ ( T −1 ( A )) = μ ( A ). (Note that, by the Krylov-Bogolyubov theorem , if X is compact and metrizable , Inv( T ) is non-empty.) Define, for continuous functions f : X → R , the maximum integral function β by        β   (  f  )    :=   sup   {    ∫  X     f   d  ν    |   ν  ∈   Inv   (  T  )     }     .     assign    β  f    supremum   conditional-set    subscript   X     f  normal-d  ν      ν    Inv  T        \beta(f):=\sup\left.\left\{\int_{X}f\,\mathrm{d}\nu\right|\nu\in\mathrm{Inv}(T%
 )\right\}.     A probability measure μ in Inv( T ) is said to be a maximising measure for f if         ∫  X     f   d  μ    =   β   (  f  )     .        subscript   X     f  normal-d  μ      β  f     \int_{X}f\,\mathrm{d}\mu=\beta(f).     Properties   It can be shown that if X is a compact space , then Inv( T ) is also compact with respect to the topology of weak convergence of measures . Hence, in this case, each continuous function f : X → R has at least one maximising measure.    If T is a continuous map of a compact metric space  X into itself and E is a topological vector space that is densely and continuously embedded in C ( X ; R ), then the set of all f in E that have a unique maximising measure is equal to a countable  intersection of open dense subsets of E .
