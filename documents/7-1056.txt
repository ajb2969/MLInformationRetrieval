Fermat cubic

In geometry, the Fermat cubic, named after Pierre de Fermat, is a surface defined by



Methods of algebraic geometry provide the following parametrization of Fermat's cubic:









In projective space the Fermat cubic is given by


 
  The 27 lines lying on the Fermat cubic are easy to describe explicitly: they are the 9 lines of the form (w : aw : y : by) where a and b are fixed numbers with cube âˆ’1, and their 18 conjugates under permutations of coordinates.
