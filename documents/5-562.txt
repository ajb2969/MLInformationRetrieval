   Choice function      Choice function   A choice function ( selector , selection ) is a mathematical function  f that is defined on some collection X of nonempty sets and assigns to each set S in that collection some element f ( S ) of S . In other words, f is a choice function for X if and only if it belongs to the direct product of X .  An example  Let X =¬†{¬†{1,4,7},¬†{9},¬†{2,7}¬†}. Then the function that assigns 7 to the set {1,4,7}, 9 to {9}, and 2 to {2,7} is a choice function on X .  History and importance  Ernst Zermelo (1904) introduced choice functions as well as the axiom of choice (AC) and proved the well-ordering theorem , 1 which states that every set can be well-ordered . AC states that every set of nonempty sets has a choice function. A weaker form of AC, the axiom of countable choice (AC œâ ) states that every countable set of nonempty sets has a choice function. However, in the absence of either AC or AC œâ , some sets can still be shown to have a choice function.   If   X   X   X   is a finite set of nonempty sets, then one can construct a choice function for   X   X   X   by picking one element from each member of    X  .    X   X.   This requires only finitely many choices, so neither AC or AC œâ is needed.    If every member of   X   X   X   is a nonempty set, and the union     ‚ãÉ  X      X    \bigcup X   is well-ordered, then one may choose the least element of each member of   X   X   X   . In this case, it was possible to simultaneously well-order every member of   X   X   X   by making just one choice of a well-order of the union, so neither AC nor AC œâ was needed. (This example shows that the well-ordering theorem implies AC. The converse is also true, but less trivial.)   Refinement of the notion of choice function  A function    f  :   A  ‚Üí  B      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  A  B     f:A\rightarrow B   is said to be a selection of a multivalued map œÜ: A ‚Üí B (that is, a function    œÜ  :   A  ‚Üí   ùí´   (  B  )        normal-:  œÜ   normal-‚Üí  A    ùí´  B      \varphi:A\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(B)   from A to the power set     ùí´   (  B  )       ùí´  B    \mathcal{P}(B)   ), if      ‚àÄ  a  ‚àà   A    (  f   (  a  )   ‚àà  œÜ   (  a  )   )   .     fragments  for-all  a   A   fragments  normal-(  f   fragments  normal-(  a  normal-)    œÜ   fragments  normal-(  a  normal-)   normal-)   normal-.    \forall a\in A\,(f(a)\in\varphi(a))\,.     The existence of more regular choice functions, namely continuous or measurable selections is important in the theory of differential inclusions , optimal control , and mathematical economics. 2  Bourbaki tau function  Nicolas Bourbaki used epsilon calculus for their foundations that had a   œÑ   œÑ   \tau   symbol that could be interpreted as choosing an object (if one existed) that satisfies a given proposition. So if    P   (  x  )       P  x    P(x)   is a predicate, then     œÑ  x    (  P  )        subscript  œÑ  x   P    \tau_{x}(P)   is the object that satisfies   P   P   P   (if one exists, otherwise it returns an arbitrary object). Hence we may obtain quantifiers from the choice function, for example    P   (    œÑ  x    (  P  )    )       P     subscript  œÑ  x   P     P(\tau_{x}(P))   was equivalent to     (   ‚àÉ  x   )    (   P   (  x  )    )         x     P  x     (\exists x)(P(x))   . 3  However, Bourbaki's choice operator is stronger than usual: it's a global choice operator. That is, it implies the axiom of global choice . 4 Hilbert realized this when introducing epsilon calculus. 5  See also   Axiom of countable choice  Hausdorff paradox  Hemicontinuity   Notes  References  "  Category:Basic concepts in set theory  Category:Axiom of choice     ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  John Harrison, "The Bourbaki View" eprint . ‚Ü©  "Here, moreover, we come upon a very remarkable circumstance, namely, that all of these transfinite axioms are derivable from a single axiom, one that also contains the core of one of the most attacked axioms in the literature of mathematics, namely, the axiom of choice     A   (  a  )    ‚Üí   A   (   Œµ   (  A  )    )       normal-‚Üí    A  a     A    Œµ  A      A(a)\to A(\varepsilon(A))   , where   Œµ   Œµ   \varepsilon   is the transfinite logical choice function."
