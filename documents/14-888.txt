   Rips machine      Rips machine   In geometric group theory , the Rips machine is a method of studying the action of groups on R -trees . It was introduced in unpublished work of Eliyahu Rips in about 1991.  An R -tree is a uniquely arcwise-connected  metric space in which every arc is isometric to some real interval. Rips proved the conjecture of  that any finitely generated group acting freely on an R -tree is a free product of free abelian and surface groups .  Actions of surface groups on R-trees  By Bass–Serre theory , a group acting freely on a simplicial tree is free. This is no longer true for R -trees, as  showed that the fundamental groups of surfaces of Euler characteristic less than −1 also act freely on a R -trees. They proved that the fundamental group of a connected closed surface S acts freely on an R-tree if and only if S is not one of the 3 nonorientable surfaces of Euler characteristic ≥−1.  Applications  The Rips machine assigns to a stable isometric action of a finitely generated group G a certain "normal form" approximation of that action by a stable action of G on a simplicial tree and hence a splitting of G in the sense of Bass–Serre theory. Group actions on real trees arise naturally in several contexts in geometric topology : for example as boundary points of the Teichmüller space 1 (every point in the Thurston boundary of the Teichmüller space is represented by a measured geodesic lamination on the surface; this lamination lifts to the universal cover of the surface and a naturally dual object to that lift is an   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   -tree endowed with an isometric action of the fundamental group of the surface), as Gromov-Hausdorff limits of, appropriately rescaled, Kleinian group actions, 2 3 and so on. The use of   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   -trees machinery provides substantial shortcuts in modern proofs of Thurston's Hyperbolization Theorem for Haken 3-manifolds . 4 5 Similarly,   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   -trees play a key role in the study of Culler - Vogtmann 's Outer space 6 7 as well as in other areas of geometric group theory ; for example, asymptotic cones of groups often have a tree-like structure and give rise to group actions on real trees . 8 9 The use of   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   -trees, together with Bass–Serre theory, is a key tool in the work of Sela on solving the isomorphism problem for (torsion-free) word-hyperbolic groups , Sela's version of the JSJ-decomposition theory and the work of Sela on the Tarski Conjecture for free groups and the theory of limit groups . 10 11  References           External links  "  Category:Hyperbolic geometry  Category:Geometric group theory  Category:Trees (topology)     Richard Skora.
