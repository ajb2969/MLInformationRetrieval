   Dust solution      Dust solution   In general relativity , a dust solution is an exact solution of the Einstein field equation in which the gravitational field is produced entirely by the mass, momentum, and stress density of a perfect fluid which has positive mass density but vanishing pressure . Dust solutions are by far the most important special case of fluid solutions in general relativity.  The pressureless perfect fluid in a dust solution can be interpreted as a model of a configuration of dust particles which interact with each other only gravitationally. For this reason, dust models are often employed in cosmology as models of a toy universe, in which the dust particles are considered as highly idealized models of galaxies, clusters, or superclusters. In astrophysics , dust solutions have been employed as models of gravitational collapse . Dust solutions can also be used to model finite rotating disks of dust grains; some examples are listed below. If superimposed somehow on a stellar model comprising a ball of fluid surrounded by vacuum, a dust solution could be used to model an accretion disk around a massive object; however, no such exact solutions modeling rotating accretion disks are yet known due to the extreme mathematical difficulty of constructing them.  Mathematical definition  The stress–energy tensor of a relativistic pressureless fluid can be written in the simple form       T   μ  ν    =   ρ   U  μ    U  ν         superscript  T    μ  ν      ρ   superscript  U  μ    superscript  U  ν      T^{\mu\nu}=\rho U^{\mu}U^{\nu}   Here   the world lines of the dust particles are the integral curves of the four-velocity     U  μ     superscript  U  μ    U^{\mu}   ,  the matter density is given by the scalar function   ρ   ρ   \rho   .   Eigenvalues  The characteristic polynomial       χ   (  λ  )    =    λ  4   +     a  3     λ  3    +     a  2     λ  2    +     a  1    λ   +   a  0          χ  λ      superscript  λ  4      subscript  a  3    superscript  λ  3       subscript  a  2    superscript  λ  2       subscript  a  1   λ    subscript  a  0      \chi(\lambda)=\lambda^{4}+a_{3}\,\lambda^{3}+a_{2}\,\lambda^{2}+a_{1}\,\lambda%
 +a_{0}   of the Einstein tensor in a dust solution must have the form       χ   (  λ  )    =    (   λ  -   8  π  μ    )    λ  3          χ  λ       λ    8  π  μ     superscript  λ  3      \chi(\lambda)=\left(\lambda-8\pi\mu\right)\,\lambda^{3}   Multiplying out this product, we find that the coefficients must satisfy the following three algebraically independent (and invariant) conditions:        a  0    =   a  1   =   a  2   =  0         subscript  a  0    subscript  a  1         subscript  a  2        0     a_{0}\,=a_{1}=a_{2}=0   Using Newton's identities , in terms of the sums of the powers of the roots (eigenvalues), which are also the traces of the powers of the Einstein tensor itself, these conditions become:        t  2   =   t  1  2    ,     t  3   =   t  1  3    ,    t  4   =   t  1  4        formulae-sequence     subscript  t  2    superscript   subscript  t  1   2     formulae-sequence     subscript  t  3    superscript   subscript  t  1   3       subscript  t  4    superscript   subscript  t  1   4       t_{2}=t_{1}^{2},\;\;t_{3}=t_{1}^{3},\;\;t_{4}=t_{1}^{4}   In tensor gymnastics notation, this can be written using the Ricci scalar as:       G   a  a    =   -  R        subscript   superscript  G  a   a     R     {G^{a}}_{a}=-R            G   a  b      G   b  a     =   R  2          subscript   superscript  G  a   b    subscript   superscript  G  b   a     superscript  R  2     {G^{a}}_{b}\,{G^{b}}_{a}=R^{2}            G   a  b       G   b  c      G   c  a     =   -   R  3           subscript   superscript  G  a   b    subscript   superscript  G  b   c    subscript   superscript  G  c   a       superscript  R  3      {G^{a}}_{b}\,{G^{b}}_{c}\,{G^{c}}_{a}=-R^{3}            G   a  b       G   b  c       G   c  d      G   d  a     =   R  4          subscript   superscript  G  a   b    subscript   superscript  G  b   c    subscript   superscript  G  c   d    subscript   superscript  G  d   a     superscript  R  4     {G^{a}}_{b}\,{G^{b}}_{c}\,{G^{c}}_{d}\,{G^{d}}_{a}=R^{4}   This eigenvalue criterion is sometimes useful in searching for dust solutions, since it shows that very few Lorentzian manifolds could possibly admit an interpretation, in general relativity, as a dust solution.  Examples  Noteworthy individual dust solutions include:   Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) dusts ( homogeneous and isotropic solutions often referred to as the matter-dominated FLRW models)  Kasner dusts (the simplest cosmological model exhibiting anisotropic expansion )  Bianchi dust models (generalizations of FLRW and Kasner models, exhibiting various types of Lie algebras of Killing vector fields )  Lemaître–Tolman–Bondi (LTB) dusts (some of the simplest inhomogeneous cosmological models , often employed as models of gravitational collapse)  Kantowski-Sachs dusts (cosmological models which exhibit perturbations from FLRW models)  van Stockum dust (a cylindrically symmetric rotating dust)  the Neugebauer-Meinel dust (which models a rotating disk of dust matched to an axisymmetric vacuum exterior; this solution has been called, with some justice, the most remarkable exact solution discovered since the Kerr vacuum )  Gödel metric   See also   Exact solutions in general relativity , for exact solutions in general,  Fluid solution , for perfect fluid solutions in general relativity (a generalization of dust solutions),  Lorentz group   References     Gives many examples of exact dust solutions.
