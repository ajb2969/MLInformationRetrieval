<h1>Standard solar model</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>standard solar model</strong> (SSM) is a mathematical treatment of the Sun as a <a class="uri" href="spherical" title="wikilink">spherical</a> ball of gas (in varying states of <a class="uri" href="ionisation" title="wikilink">ionisation</a>, with the hydrogen in the deep interior being a completely ionised <a href="plasma_(physics)" title="wikilink">plasma</a>). This model, technically the <a href="spherically_symmetric" title="wikilink">spherically symmetric</a> <a href="Quasistatic_equilibrium" title="wikilink">quasi-static</a> model of a star, has <a href="stellar_structure" title="wikilink">stellar structure</a> described by several differential equations derived from basic physical principles. The model is constrained by <a href="boundary_conditions" title="wikilink">boundary conditions</a>, namely the luminosity, radius, age and composition of the Sun, which are well determined. The age of the Sun cannot be measured directly; one way to estimate it is from the age of the oldest meteorites, and models of the evolution of the Solar System.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The composition in the photosphere of the modern-day Sun, by mass, is 74.9% hydrogen and 23.8% helium.<ref name="lodders"></ref></p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li>

<p> All heavier elements, called <em><a href="metallicity" title="wikilink">metals</a></em> in astronomy, account for less than 2 percent of the mass. The SSM is used to test the validity of stellar evolution theory. In fact, the only way to determine the two free parameters of the stellar evolution model, the helium abundance and the <a href="mixing_length_theory" title="wikilink">mixing length</a> parameter (used to model convection in the Sun), are to adjust the SSM to "fit" the observed Sun.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-calibrated-solar-model">A calibrated solar model</h2>

<p>A star is considered to be at zero age (protostellar) when it is assumed to have a homogeneous composition and to be just beginning to derive most of its luminosity from nuclear reactions (so neglecting the period of contraction from a cloud of gas and dust). To obtain the SSM, a one <a href="solar_mass" title="wikilink">solar mass</a> () stellar model at zero age is <a href="stellar_evolution" title="wikilink">evolved</a> numerically to the age of the Sun. The abundance of elements in the zero age solar model is estimated from primordial meteorites.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Along with this abundance information, a reasonable guess at the zero-age luminosity (such as the present-day Sun's luminosity) is then converted by an iterative procedure into the correct value for the model, and the temperature, pressure and density throughout the model calculated by solving the equations of stellar structure numerically assuming the star to be in a <a href="steady_state" title="wikilink">steady state</a>. The model is then evolved numerically up to the age of the Sun. Any discrepancy from the measured values of the Sun's luminosity, surface abundances, etc. can then be used to refine the model. For example, since the Sun formed, the helium and heavy elements have settled out of the photosphere by diffusion. As a result, the Solar photosphere now contains about 87% as much helium and heavy elements as the protostellar photosphere had; the protostellar Solar photosphere was 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% metals.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> A measure of heavy-element settling by diffusion is required for a more accurate model.</p>
<h2 id="numerical-modelling-of-the-stellar-structure-equations">Numerical modelling of the stellar structure equations</h2>

<p>The differential equations of stellar structure, such as the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, are integrated numerically. The differential equations are approximated by <a href="difference_equations" title="wikilink">difference equations</a>. The star is imagined to be made up of spherically symmetric shells and the numerical integration carried out in finite steps making use of the <a href="equation_of_state" title="wikilink">equations of state</a>, giving relationships for the pressure, the opacity and the energy generation rate in terms of the density, temperature and composition.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="evolution-of-the-sun">Evolution of the Sun</h2>

<p>Nuclear reactions in the core of the Sun change its composition, by converting <a class="uri" href="hydrogen" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a> nuclei into <a class="uri" href="helium" title="wikilink">helium</a> nuclei by the <a href="proton-proton_chain" title="wikilink">proton-proton chain</a> and (to a lesser extent in the Sun than in more massive stars) the <a href="CNO_cycle" title="wikilink">CNO cycle</a>. This increases the mean molecular weight in the core of the Sun, which should lead to a decrease in pressure. This does not happen as instead the core contracts. By the <a href="Virial_theorem" title="wikilink">Virial Theorem</a> half of the gravitational <a href="potential_energy" title="wikilink">potential energy</a> released by this contraction goes towards raising the temperature of the core, and the other half is radiated away. By the <a href="ideal_gas_law" title="wikilink">ideal gas law</a> this increase in temperature also increases the pressure and restores the balance of <a href="hydrostatic_equilibrium" title="wikilink">hydrostatic equilibrium</a>. The luminosity of the Sun is increased by the temperature rise, increasing the rate of nuclear reactions. The outer layers expand to compensate for the increased temperature and pressure gradients, so the radius also increases.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>No star is completely static, but stars stay on the main sequence (burning hydrogen in the core) for long periods. In the case of the Sun, it has been on the main sequence for roughly 4.6 billion years, and will become a red giant in roughly 6.5 billion years<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> for a total main sequence lifetime of roughly 11 billion (10<sup>10</sup>) years. Thus the assumption of <a href="steady_state" title="wikilink">steady state</a> is a very good approximation. For simplicity, the stellar structure equations are written without explicit time dependence, with the exception of the luminosity gradient equation:</p>

<p>Here L is the luminosity, ε is the nuclear energy generation rate per unit mass and ε<sub>ν</sub> is the luminosity due to neutrino emission (see <a href="#Energy_transport_in_the_Sun" title="wikilink">below</a> for the other quantities). The slow evolution of the Sun on the main sequence is then determined by the change in the nuclear species (principally hydrogen being consumed and helium being produced). The rates of the various nuclear reactions are estimated from particle physics experiments at high energies, which are extrapolated back to the lower energies of stellar interiors (the Sun burns hydrogen rather slowly). Historically, errors in the nuclear reaction rates have been one of the biggest sources of error in stellar modelling. Computers are employed to calculate the varying abundances (usually by mass fraction) of the nuclear species. A particular species will have a rate of production and a rate of destruction, so both are needed to calculate its abundance over time, at varying conditions of temperature and density. Since there are many nuclear species, a computerised <a href="reaction_network" title="wikilink">reaction network</a> is needed to keep track of how all the abundances vary together.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="Vogt-Russel_theorem" title="wikilink">Vogt-Russel theorem</a>, the mass and the composition structure throughout a star uniquely determine its radius, luminosity, and internal structure, as well as its subsequent evolution (though this "theorem" was only intended to apply to the slow, stable phases of stellar evolution and certainly does not apply to the transitions between stages and rapid evolutionary stages).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The information about the varying abundances of nuclear species over time, along with the equations of state, is sufficient for a numerical solution by taking sufficiently small time increments and using iteration to find the unique internal structure of the star at each stage.</p>
<h2 id="purpose-of-the-standard-solar-model">Purpose of the standard solar model</h2>

<p>The SSM serves two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>it provides estimates for the helium abundance and mixing length parameter by forcing the stellar model to have the correct luminosity and radius at the Sun's age,</li>
<li>it provides a way to evaluate more complex models with additional physics, such as rotation, magnetic fields and diffusion or improvements to the treatment of convection, such as modelling turbulence, and convective overshooting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like the <a href="Standard_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Model</a> of <a href="particle_physics" title="wikilink">particle physics</a> and the <a href="physical_cosmology" title="wikilink">standard cosmology</a> model the SSM changes over time in response to relevant new <a href="theoretical_physics" title="wikilink">theoretical</a> or <a href="experimental_physics" title="wikilink">experimental physics</a> discoveries.</p>
<h2 id="energy-transport-in-the-sun">Energy transport in the Sun</h2>

<p>As described in the <a class="uri" href="Sun" title="wikilink">Sun</a> article, the Sun has a radiative core and a convective outer envelope. In the core, the luminosity due to nuclear reactions is transmitted to outer layers principally by radiation. However, in the outer layers the temperature gradient is so great that radiation cannot transport enough energy. As a result, thermal convection occurs as thermal columns carry hot material to the surface (photosphere) of the Sun. Once the material cools off at the surface, it plunges back downward to the base of the convection zone, to receive more heat from the top of the radiative zone.</p>

<p>In a solar model, as described in <a href="stellar_structure" title="wikilink">stellar structure</a>, one considers the <a class="uri" href="density" title="wikilink">density</a>

<p>Helioseismology is the study of the wave oscillations in the Sun.

In particular, the location of the convection zone in the outer layers of the Sun can be measured, and information about the core of the Sun provides a method, using the SSM, to calculate the age of the Sun, independently of the method of inferring the age of the Sun from that of the oldest meteorites.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> This is another example of how the SSM can be refined.</p>

<p>Hydrogen is fused into helium through several different interactions in the Sun. The vast majority of <a href="neutrino" title="wikilink">neutrinos</a> are produced through the <a href="pp_chain" title="wikilink">pp chain</a>, a process in which four protons are combined to produce two <a href="proton" title="wikilink">protons</a>, two <a href="neutron" title="wikilink">neutrons</a>, two <a href="positron" title="wikilink">positrons</a>, and two electron neutrinos. Neutrinos are also produced by the <a href="CNO_cycle" title="wikilink">CNO cycle</a>, but that process is considerably less important in the Sun than in other stars.</p>

<p>Most of the neutrinos produced in the Sun come from the first step of the pp chain but their energy is so low (  they are very difficult to detect. A rare side branch of the pp chain produces the "<a class="uri" href="boron" title="wikilink">boron</a>-8" neutrinos with a maximum energy of roughly 15 MeV, and these are the easiest neutrinos to detect. A very rare interaction in the pp chain produces the <a href="Proton–proton_chain_reaction#The_pp_IV_.28Hep.29_branch" title="wikilink">"hep" neutrinos</a>, the highest energy neutrinos predicted to be produced by the Sun. They are predicted to have a maximum energy of about 18 MeV.</p>

<p>All of the interactions described above produce neutrinos with a <a class="uri" href="spectrum" title="wikilink">spectrum</a> of energies. The <a href="electron_capture" title="wikilink">electron capture</a> of <sup>7</sup>Be produces neutrinos at either roughly 0.862 MeV (~90%) or 0.384 MeV (~10%).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>The weakness of the neutrino's interactions with other particles means that most neutrinos produced in the core of the Sun can <a href="Transparency_(optics)" title="wikilink">pass all the way through the Sun without being absorbed</a>. It is possible, therefore, to observe the core of the Sun directly by detecting these neutrinos.</p>

<p>The first experiment to successfully detect cosmic neutrinos was <a href="Raymond_Davis_Jr." title="wikilink">Ray Davis's</a> <a href="Homestake_Experiment" title="wikilink">chlorine experiment</a>, in which neutrinos were detected by observing the <a href="Nuclear_transmutation" title="wikilink">conversion</a> of <a class="uri" href="chlorine" title="wikilink">chlorine</a> <a href="atomic_nucleus" title="wikilink">nuclei</a> to radioactive <a class="uri" href="argon" title="wikilink">argon</a> in a large <a href="Chemical_tank" title="wikilink">tank</a> of <a class="uri" href="perchloroethylene" title="wikilink">perchloroethylene</a>. This was a reaction channel expected for neutrinos, but since only the number of argon decays was counted, it did not give any directional information, such as where the neutrinos came from. The experiment found about 1/3 as many neutrinos as were predicted by the standard solar model of the time, and this problem became known as the <a href="solar_neutrino_problem" title="wikilink">solar neutrino problem</a>.</p>

<p>While it is now known that the chlorine experiment detected neutrinos, some physicists at the time were suspicious of the experiment, mainly because they did not trust such radiochemical techniques. Unambiguous detection of solar neutrinos was provided by the <a class="uri" href="Kamiokande-II" title="wikilink">Kamiokande-II</a> experiment, a <a class="uri" href="water" title="wikilink">water</a> <a class="uri" href="Cerenkov" title="wikilink">Cerenkov</a> detector with a low enough energy threshold to detect neutrinos through neutrino-electron <a href="elastic_scattering" title="wikilink">elastic scattering</a>. In the elastic scattering interaction the electrons coming out of the point of reaction strongly point in the direction that the neutrino was travelling, away from the Sun. This ability to "point back" at the Sun was the first conclusive evidence that the Sun is powered by nuclear interactions in the core. While the neutrinos observed in Kamiokande-II were clearly from the Sun, the rate of neutrino interactions was again suppressed compared to theory at the time. Even worse, the Kamiokande-II experiment measured about 1/2 the predicted flux, rather than the chlorine experiment's 1/3.</p>

<p>The solution to the solar neutrino problem was finally experimentally determined by the <a href="Sudbury_Neutrino_Observatory" title="wikilink">Sudbury Neutrino Observatory</a>. The radiochemical experiments were only sensitive to electron neutrinos, and the signal in the water Cerenkov experiments was dominated by the electron neutrino signal. The SNO experiment, by contrast, had sensitivity to all three neutrino flavours. By simultaneously measuring the electron neutrino and total neutrino fluxes the experiment demonstrated that the suppression was due to the <a href="MSW_effect" title="wikilink">MSW effect</a>, the conversion of electron neutrinos from their pure flavour state into the second neutrino mass eigenstate as they passed through a <a class="uri" href="resonance" title="wikilink">resonance</a> due to the changing density of the Sun. The resonance is energy dependent, and "turns on" near 2MeV.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The water Cerenkov detectors only detect neutrinos above about 5MeV, while the radiochemical experiments were sensitive to lower energy (0.8MeV for <a class="uri" href="chlorine" title="wikilink">chlorine</a>, 0.2MeV for <a class="uri" href="gallium" title="wikilink">gallium</a>), and this turned out to be the source of the difference in the observed neutrino rates at the two types of experiments.</p>
<h3 id="hep-neutrinos">hep neutrinos</h3>

<p>The highest energy neutrinos have not yet been observed due to their small flux compared to the boron-8 neutrinos, so thus far only limits have been placed on the flux. No experiment yet has had enough <a href="Sensitivity_(electronics)" title="wikilink">sensitivity</a> to observe the flux predicted by the SSM.</p>
<h3 id="cno-neutrinos">CNO neutrinos</h3>

<p>Neutrinos from a secondary cycle of solar energy generation – i.e., the CNO-neutrinos – are also expected to provide observable events below 1 MeV. They have not yet been observed due to experimental noise (background). Future ultra-pure scintillator detectors should allow us to probe the flux predicted by the SSM. This should be possible thanks to SNO+ and, on the longer term, thanks to LENA, two detectors that will be larger but will use the same principles of Borexino.</p>
<h3 id="future-experiments">Future experiments</h3>

<p>While radiochemical experiments have in some sense observed the pp and Be7 neutrinos they have measured only integral fluxes. The "<a href="holy_grail" title="wikilink">holy grail</a>" of solar neutrino experiments would detect the Be7 neutrinos with a detector that is sensitive to the individual neutrino energies. This experiment would test the MSW hypothesis by searching for the turn-on of the MSW effect. Some <a href="Exotic_matter" title="wikilink">exotic</a> models are still capable of explaining the solar neutrino deficit, so the observation of the MSW turn on would, in effect, finally solve the solar neutrino problem.</p>
<h2 id="core-temperature-prediction">Core temperature prediction</h2>

<p>The flux of boron-8 neutrinos is highly sensitive to the temperature of the core of the Sun,

<h2 id="lithium-depletion-at-the-solar-surface">Lithium depletion at the solar surface</h2>

<p><a href="Stellar_structure" title="wikilink">Stellar models</a> of the Sun's evolution predict the solar surface chemical abundance pretty well except for <a class="uri" href="lithium" title="wikilink">lithium</a> (Li). The surface abundance of Li on the Sun is 140 times less than the <a href="protostar" title="wikilink">protosolar</a> value (i.e. the primordial abundance at the Sun's birth),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> yet the temperature at the base of the surface convective zone is not hot enough to burn – and hence deplete – Li.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> This is known as the solar lithium problem. A large range of Li abundances is observed in solar-type stars of the same age, mass, and metallicity as the Sun. Observations of an unbiased sample of stars of this type with or without observed planets (<a class="uri" href="exoplanets" title="wikilink">exoplanets</a>) showed that the known planet-bearing stars have less than one per cent of the primordial Li abundance, and of the remainder half had ten times as much Li. It is hypothesised that the presence of planets may increase the amount of mixing and deepen the convective zone to such an extent that the Li can be burned. A possible mechanism for this is the idea that the planets affect the angular momentum evolution of the star, thus changing the rotation of the star relative to similar stars without planets; in the case of the Sun slowing its rotation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> More research is needed to discover where and when the fault in the modelling lies. Given the precision of <a href="helioseismology" title="wikilink">helioseismic</a> probes of the interior of the modern-day Sun, it is likely that the modelling of the protostellar Sun needs to be adjusted.</p>
