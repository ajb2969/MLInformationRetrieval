Airy points

Airy Points are used for precision measurement (metrology) to support a length standard in such a way as to minimise bending or droop. The points are symmetrically arranged around the centre of the length standard and are separated by a distance equal to



Airy points are normally identified by inscribed marks or lines. For example, a 1000 mm length gauge would have an Airy point separation of 577 mm. A line or pair of lines would be marked onto the gauge 211.5 mm in from each end. Supporting the artifact at these points ensures that the calibrated length is preserved. If the length gauge is not supported at the Airy points, the measurement uncertainty is increased.
It is not necessary to be absolutely exact; the approximation 4/7 = 0.
 
 
 
  is commonly used even at the highest levels of precision. For example, the 1927–60 definition of the metre specified that the International Prototype Metre bar was to be measured while "supported on two cylinders of at least one centimetre diameter, symmetrically placed in the same horizontal plane at a distance of 571 mm from each other."1
