   Lightface analytic game      Lightface analytic game   In descriptive set theory , a lightface analytic game is a game whose payoff set  A is a    Σ  1  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   1    \Sigma^{1}_{1}    subset of Baire space ; that is, there is a tree  T on    ω  ×  ω      ω  ω    \omega\times\omega   which is a computable subset of     (   ω  ×  ω   )     <  ω      superscript    ω  ω     absent  ω     (\omega\times\omega)^{<\omega}   , such that A is the projection of the set of all branches of T .  The determinacy of all lightface analytic games is equivalent to the existence of 0 # .  "  Category:Effective descriptive set theory  Category:Determinacy
