Lightface analytic game

In descriptive set theory, a lightface analytic game is a game whose payoff set A is a 
 
 
subset of Baire space; that is, there is a tree T on 
 
 
 
  which is a computable subset of 
 
 
 
 , such that A is the projection of the set of all branches of T.
The determinacy of all lightface analytic games is equivalent to the existence of 0#.
