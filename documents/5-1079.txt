   Coefficient of haze      Coefficient of haze   The coefficient of haze (also known as smoke shade ) is a measurement of visibility interference in the atmosphere . 1  One way to measure this is to draw about 1000 feet of air sample through an air filter and obtain the radiation intensity through the filter. The coefficient is then calculated based on the absorbance formula       C  O  H   =   -   100    log  10    (    I  1    I  0    )            C  O  H       100    subscript   10      subscript  I  1    subscript  I  0         COH=-100\log_{10}\left(\frac{I_{1}}{I_{0}}\right)   where    I  1     subscript  I  1    I_{1}   is the radiation (400 nm light) intensity transmitted through the sampled filter, and    I  0     subscript  I  0    I_{0}   is the radiation intensity transmitted through a clean (control) filter. 2  References   3  4   Further reading      "  Category:Visibility       ↩  ↩
