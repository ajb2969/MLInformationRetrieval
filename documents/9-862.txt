   Median absolute deviation      Median absolute deviation   In statistics , the median absolute deviation (MAD) is a robust measure of the variability of a univariate sample of quantitative data . It can also refer to the population  parameter that is estimated by the MAD calculated from a sample.  For a univariate data set X 1 , X 2 , ..., X n , the MAD is defined as the median of the absolute deviations from the data's median:       MAD  =    median  i    (   |    X  i   -    median  j    (   X  j   )     |   )     ,      MAD    subscript  median  i        subscript  X  i     subscript  median  j    subscript  X  j         \operatorname{MAD}=\operatorname{median}_{i}\left(\ \left|X_{i}-\operatorname{%
 median}_{j}(X_{j})\right|\ \right),\,     that is, starting with the residuals (deviations) from the data's median, the MAD is the median of their absolute values .  Example  Consider the data (1, 1, 2, 2 , 4, 6, 9). It has a median value of 2. The absolute deviations about 2 are (1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 4, 7) which in turn have a median value of 1 (because the sorted absolute deviations are (0, 0, 1, 1 , 2, 4, 7)). So the median absolute deviation for this data is 1.  Uses  The median absolute deviation is a measure of statistical dispersion . Moreover, the MAD is a robust statistic , being more resilient to outliers in a data set than the standard deviation . In the standard deviation, the distances from the mean are squared, so large deviations are weighted more heavily, and thus outliers can heavily influence it. In the MAD, the deviations of a small number of outliers are irrelevant.  Because the MAD is a more robust estimator of scale than the sample variance or standard deviation , it works better with distributions without a mean or variance, such as the Cauchy distribution .  Relation to standard deviation  In order to use the MAD as a consistent estimator for the estimation of the standard deviation σ, one takes        σ  ^   =   K  ⋅  MAD    ,       normal-^  σ    normal-⋅  K  MAD     \hat{\sigma}=K\cdot\operatorname{MAD},\,     where K is a constant scale factor , which depends on the distribution. 1  For normally distributed data K is taken to be     1  /   (    Φ   -  1     (   3  /  4   )    )    ≈  1.4826        1     superscript  normal-Φ    1      3  4     1.4826    1/\left(\Phi^{-1}(3/4)\right)\approx 1.4826   , where    Φ   -  1      superscript  normal-Φ    1     \Phi^{-1}   is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function for the standard normal distribution, i.e., the quantile function . This is because the MAD is given by:       1  2   =  P   (  |  X  -  μ  |  ≤  MAD  )   =  P   (  |    X  -  μ   σ   |  ≤   MAD  σ   )   =  P   (  |  Z  |  ≤   MAD  σ   )   .     fragments    1  2    P   fragments  normal-(  normal-|  X   μ  normal-|   MAD  normal-)    P   fragments  normal-(  normal-|      X  μ   σ   normal-|     MAD  σ   normal-)    P   fragments  normal-(  normal-|  Z  normal-|     MAD  σ   normal-)   normal-.    \frac{1}{2}=P(|X-\mu|\leq\operatorname{MAD})=P\left(\left|\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}%
 \right|\leq\frac{\operatorname{MAD}}{\sigma}\right)=P\left(|Z|\leq\frac{%
 \operatorname{MAD}}{\sigma}\right).     Therefore we must have that      Φ   (   MAD  /  σ   )    -   Φ   (   -   MAD  /  σ    )     =   1  /  2           normal-Φ    MAD  σ      normal-Φ      MAD  σ        1  2     \Phi\left(\operatorname{MAD}/\sigma\right)-\Phi\left(-\operatorname{MAD}/%
 \sigma\right)=1/2   . Since     Φ   (   -   MAD  /  σ    )    =   1  -   Φ   (   MAD  /  σ   )           normal-Φ      MAD  σ       1    normal-Φ    MAD  σ       \Phi\left(-\operatorname{MAD}/\sigma\right)=1-\Phi\left(\operatorname{MAD}/%
 \sigma\right)   we have that     MAD  /  σ   =    Φ   -  1     (   3  /  4   )          MAD  σ      superscript  normal-Φ    1      3  4      \operatorname{MAD}/\sigma=\Phi^{-1}\left(3/4\right)   from which we obtain the scale factor    K  =   1  /   (    Φ   -  1     (   3  /  4   )    )        K    1     superscript  normal-Φ    1      3  4       K=1/\left(\Phi^{-1}(3/4)\right)   .  Hence       σ  ≈    1.4826   MAD    .      σ    1.4826  MAD     \sigma\approx 1.4826\ \operatorname{MAD}.\,     In other words, the expectation of 1.4826 times the MAD for large samples of normally distributed X i is approximately equal to the population standard deviation.  The factor     1.4826   ≈   1  /   (    Φ   -  1     (   3  /  4   )    )        1.4826    1     superscript  normal-Φ    1      3  4       1.4826\ \approx 1/\left(\Phi^{-1}(3/4)\right)   results from the reciprocal of the normal  inverse cumulative distribution function ,     Φ   -  1     (  P  )        superscript  normal-Φ    1    P    \Phi^{-1}(P)   , evaluated at probability    P  =   3  /  4       P    3  4     P=3/4   . 2 3  The population MAD  The population MAD is defined analogously to the sample MAD, but is based on the complete distribution rather than on a sample. For a symmetric distribution with zero mean, the population MAD is the 75th percentile of the distribution.  Unlike the variance , which may be infinite or undefined, the population MAD is always a finite number. For example, the standard Cauchy distribution has undefined variance, but its MAD is 1.  The earliest known mention of the concept of the MAD occurred in 1816, in a paper by Carl Friedrich Gauss on the determination of the accuracy of numerical observations. 4 5  See also   Deviation (statistics)  Robust measures of scale  Relative mean absolute difference   Notes  References       "  Category:Statistical deviation and dispersion  Category:Robust statistics     ↩  [ http://books.google.com/books?id=i2bD50PbIikC&lpg; ;=PA118&dq;=1.4826&pg;=PA118#v=onepage&q;=1.4826&f;=false] ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
