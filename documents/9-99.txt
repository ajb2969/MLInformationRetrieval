Fourier–Mukai transform

In algebraic geometry, the Fourier–Mukai transform or Mukai–Fourier transform, introduced by , is an isomorphism between the derived categories of coherent sheaves on an abelian variety and its dual. It is analogous to the classical Fourier transform that gives an isomorphism between tempered distributions on a finite-dimensional real vector space and its dual.
If the canonical class of a variety is positive or negative, then the derived category of coherent sheaves determines the variety. The Fourier–Mukai transform gives examples of different varieties (with trivial canonical bundle) that have isomorphic derived categories, as in general an abelian variety of dimension greater than 1 is not isomorphic to its dual.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be an abelian variety and 
 
 
 
  be its dual variety. We denote by 
 
 
 
  the Poincaré bundle on



normalized to be trivial on the fibers at zero. Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be the canonical projections.
The Fourier–Mukai functor is then



The notation here: D means derived category of coherent sheaves, and R is the higher direct image functor, at the derived category level.
There is a similar functor



Properties
Let g denote the dimension of X.
The Fourier–Mukai transformation is nearly involutive :



It transforms Pontrjagin product in tensor product and conversely.
