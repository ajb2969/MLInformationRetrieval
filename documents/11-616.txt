Galacturan 1,4-alpha-galacturonidase

In enzymology, a galacturan 1,4-alpha-galacturonidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(1,4-alpha-D-galacturonide)n + H2O 
 
 
 
  (1,4-alpha-D-galacturonide)n-1 + D-galacturonate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (1,4-alpha-D-galacturonide)n and H2O, whereas its two products are (1,4-alpha-D-galacturonide)n-1 and D-galacturonate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is poly(1,4-alpha-D-galacturonide) galacturonohydrolase. Other names in common use include exopolygalacturonase, poly(galacturonate) hydrolase, exo-D-galacturonase, exo-D-galacturonanase, and exopoly-D-galacturonase. This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions and starch and sucrose metabolism.
