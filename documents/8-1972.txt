   Symmetrization      Symmetrization   In mathematics , symmetrization is a process that converts any function in n variables to a symmetric function in n variables. Conversely, anti-symmetrization converts any function in n variables into an antisymmetric function.  2 variables  Let   S   S   S   be a set and   A   A   A   an Abelian group . Given a map    α  :    S  ×  S   →  A      normal-:  α   normal-→    S  S   A     \alpha:S\times S\to A   ,   α   α   \alpha   is termed a symmetric map if     α   (  s  ,  t  )    =   α   (  t  ,  s  )          α   s  t      α   t  s      \alpha(s,t)=\alpha(t,s)   for all     s  ,  t   ∈  S       s  t   S    s,t\in S   .  The symmetrization of a map    α  :    S  ×  S   →  A      normal-:  α   normal-→    S  S   A     \alpha\colon S\times S\to A   is the map     (  x  ,  y  )   ↦    α   (  x  ,  y  )    +   α   (  y  ,  x  )        maps-to   x  y       α   x  y      α   y  x       (x,y)\mapsto\alpha(x,y)+\alpha(y,x)   .  Conversely, the anti-symmetrization or skew-symmetrization of a map    α  :    S  ×  S   →  A      normal-:  α   normal-→    S  S   A     \alpha\colon S\times S\to A   is the map     (  x  ,  y  )   ↦    α   (  x  ,  y  )    -   α   (  y  ,  x  )        maps-to   x  y       α   x  y      α   y  x       (x,y)\mapsto\alpha(x,y)-\alpha(y,x)   .  The sum of the symmetrization and the anti-symmetrization is     2  α   .      2  α    2\alpha.   Thus, away from 2 , meaning if 2 is invertible, such as for the real numbers, one can divide by 2 and express every function as a sum of a symmetric function and an anti-symmetric function.  The symmetrization of a symmetric map is simply its double, while the symmetrization of an alternating map is zero; similarly, the anti-symmetrization of a symmetric map is zero, while the anti-symmetrization of an anti-symmetric map is its double.  Bilinear forms  The symmetrization and anti-symmetrization of a bilinear map are bilinear; thus away from 2, every bilinear form is a sum of a symmetric form and a skew-symmetric form, and there is no difference between a symmetric form and a quadratic form.  At 2, not every form can be decomposed into a symmetric form and a skew-symmetric form – for instance, over the integers, the associated symmetric form (over the rationals) may take half-integer values, while over     𝐙  /  2   ,      𝐙  2    \mathbf{Z}/2,   a function is skew-symmetric if and only if it is symmetric (as    1  =   -  1       1    1     1=-1   ).  This leads to the notion of ε-quadratic forms and ε-symmetric forms.  Representation theory  In terms of representation theory :   exchanging variables gives a representation of the symmetric group on the space of functions in two variables,  the symmetric and anti-symmetric functions are the subrepresentations corresponding to the trivial representation and the sign representation , and  symmetrization and anti-symmetrization map a function into these subrepresentations – if one divides by 2, these yield projection maps .   As the symmetric group of order two equals the cyclic group of order two (     S  2   =   C  2        subscript  normal-S  2    subscript  normal-C  2     \mathrm{S}_{2}=\mathrm{C}_{2}   ), this corresponds to the discrete Fourier transform of order two.  n variables  More generally, given a function in n variables, one can symmetrize by taking the sum over all    n  !      n    n!   permutations of the variables, 1 or anti-symmetrize by taking the sum over all     n  !   /  2        n   2    n!/2    even permutations and subtracting the sum over all     n  !   /  2        n   2    n!/2   odd permutations.  Here symmetrizing (respectively anti-symmetrizing) a symmetric function multiplies by n ! – thus if n ! is invertible, such as if one is working over the rationals or over a field of characteristic     p  >  n   ,      p  n    p>n,   then these yield projections.  In terms of representation theory, these only yield the subrepresentations corresponding to the trivial and sign representation, but for    n  >  2      n  2    n>2   there are others – see representation theory of the symmetric group and symmetric polynomials .  Bootstrapping  Given a function in k variables, one can obtain a symmetric function in n variables by taking the sum over k element subsets of the variables. In statistics, this is referred to as bootstrapping , and the associated statistics are called U-statistics .
