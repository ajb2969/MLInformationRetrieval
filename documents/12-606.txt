Birnbaum–Orlicz space

In the mathematical analysis, and especially in real and harmonic analysis, a Birnbaum–Orlicz space is a type of function space which generalizes the Lp spaces. Like the Lp spaces, they are Banach spaces. The spaces are named for Władysław Orlicz and Zygmunt William Birnbaum, who first defined them in 1931.
Besides the Lp spaces, a variety of function spaces arising naturally in analysis are Birnbaum–Orlicz spaces. One such space L log+ L, which arises in the study of Hardy–Littlewood maximal functions, consists of measurable functions f such that the integral



Here log+ is the positive part of the logarithm. Also included in the class of Birnbaum–Orlicz spaces are many of the most important Sobolev spaces.
Formal definition
Suppose that μ is a σ-finite measure on a set X, and Φ : [0, ∞) → [0, ∞) is a Young function, i.e., a convex function such that






Let 
 
 
 
  be the set of measurable functions f : X → R such that the integral



is finite, where, as usual, functions that agree almost everywhere are identified.
This may not be a vector space (it may fail to be closed under scalar multiplication). The vector space of functions spanned by 
 
 
 
  is the Birnbaum–Orlicz space, denoted 
 
 
 
 .
To define a norm on 
 
 
 
 , let Ψ be the Young complement of Φ; that is,


 
  Note that Young's inequality holds:


 
  The norm is then given by


 
  Furthermore, the space 
 
 
 
  is precisely the space of measurable functions for which this norm is finite.
An equivalent norm  is defined on LΦ by



and likewise LΦ(μ) is the space of all measurable functions for which this norm is finite.
Example
Here is an example where 
 
 
 
  is not a vector space and is strictly smaller than 
 
 
 
 . Suppose that X is the open unit interval (0,1), Φ(x)=exp(x)–1–x, and f(x)=log(x). Then af is in the space 
 
 
 
  but is only in the set 
 
 
 
  if |a|p'' spaces (for 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 , so 
 
 
 
 .

The Orlicz space 
 
 
 
  is a Banach space — a complete normed vector space.

Relations to Sobolev spaces
Certain Sobolev spaces are embedded in Orlicz spaces: for 
 
 
open and bounded with Lipschitz boundary

 
 ,


 
  for



This is the analytical content of the Trudinger inequality: For 
 
 
 
  open and bounded with Lipschitz boundary 
 
 
 
 , consider the space 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . There exist constants 
 
 
 
  such that



Orlicz Norm of a Random Variable
Similarly, the Orlicz norm of a random variable characterizes it as follows:


 
  This norm is homogeneous and is defined only when this set is non-empty.
When 
 
 
 
 , this coincides with the p-th moment of the random variable. Other special cases in the exponential family are taken with respect to the functions 
 
 
 
  (for 
 
 
 
 ). A random variable with finite 
 
 
 
  norm is said to be "sub-Gaussian" and a random variable with finite 
 
 
 
  norm is said to be "sub-exponential". Indeed, the boundedness of the 
 
 
 
  norm characterizes the limiting behavior of the probability density function:


 
  so that the tail of this probability density function asymptotically resembles, and is bounded above by 
 
 
 
 .
The 
 
 
 
  norm may be easily computed from a strictly monotonic moment-generating function. For example, the moment-generating function of a chi-squared random variable X with K degrees of freedom is 
 
 
 
 , so that the inverse of the 
 
 
 
  norm is related to the functional inverse of the moment-generating function:
$$\|X\|_{\Psi_1} ^{-1} = M_X^{-1}(2) = (1-4^{-1/K})/2.$$
