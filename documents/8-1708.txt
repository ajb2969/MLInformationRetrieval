   Nested loop join      Nested loop join   A nested loop join is a naive algorithm that joins two sets by using two nested loops . Join operations are important to database management.  Algorithm  Two relations   R   R   R   and   S   S   S   are joined as follows:  For each tuple r in R do  For each tuple s in S do  If r and s satisfy the join condition  Then output the tuple  This algorithm will involve n r *b s + b r block transfers and n r +b r seeks, where b r and b s are number of blocks in relations R and S respectively, and n r is the number of tuples in relation R.  The algorithm runs in    O   (    |  R  |    |  S  |    )       O      R     S      O(|R||S|)   I/Os, where    |  R  |      R    |R|   and    |  S  |      S    |S|   is the number of tuples contained in   R   R   R   and   S   S   S   respectively. Can easily be generalized to join any number of relations.  The block nested loop join algorithm is a generalization of the simple nested loops algorithm that takes advantage of additional memory to reduce the number of times that the   S   S   S   relation is scanned.  Improved version  The algorithm can be improved without requesting additional memory blocks to involve only b r *b s + b r block transfers. For each read block from   R   R   R   , the relation   S   S   S   can be read only once.  For each block block_r in R do  For each tuple s in S do  For each tuple r in block_r do  If r and s satisfy the join condition  Then output the tuple  Variable block_r is stored in memory, thus it is not needed to read it from disk for each tuple   s   s   s   .
