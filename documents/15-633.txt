   Log structure      Log structure   In algebraic geometry , a log structure provides an abstract context to study semistable schemes , and in particular the notion of logarithmic differential form and the related Hodge-theoretic concepts. This idea has applications in the theory of moduli spaces , in deformation theory and Fontaine's p-adic Hodge theory , among others.  Motivation  The idea is to study some algebraic variety (or scheme ) U which is smooth but not necessarily proper by embedding it into X , which is proper, and then looking at certain sheaves on X . The problem is that the subsheaf of    𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   consisting of functions whose restriction to U is invertible is not a sheaf of rings (as adding two non-vanishing functions could provide one which vanishes), and we only get a sheaf of submonoids of    𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   , multiplicatively. Remembering this additional structure on X corresponds to somehow remembering the inclusion    j  :   U  →  X      normal-:  j   normal-→  U  X     j\colon U\to X   , which likens X with this extra structure to a variety with boundary (corresponding to    D  =   X  -  U       D    X  U     D=X-U   ). 1  Definition  Let X be a scheme. A pre-log structure on X consists of a sheaf of (commutative) monoids   ℳ   ℳ   \mathcal{M}   on X together with a homomorphism of monoids    α  :   ℳ  →   𝒪  X       normal-:  α   normal-→  ℳ   subscript  𝒪  X      \alpha\colon\mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{O}_{X}   , where    𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   is considered as a monoid under multiplication of functions.  A pre-log structure    (  ℳ  ,  α  )     ℳ  α    (\mathcal{M},\alpha)   is a log structure if in addition   α   α   \alpha   induces an isomorphism    α  :     α   -  1     (   𝒪  X  ×   )    →   𝒪  X  ×       normal-:  α   normal-→     superscript  α    1     superscript   subscript  𝒪  X       superscript   subscript  𝒪  X        \alpha\colon\alpha^{-1}(\mathcal{O}_{X}^{\times})\to\mathcal{O}_{X}^{\times}   .  A morphism of (pre-)log structures consists in a homomorphism of sheaves of monoids commuting with the associated homomorphisms into    𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   .  A log scheme is simply a scheme furnished with a log structure.  Examples   For any scheme X , one can define the trivial log structure on X by taking    ℳ  =   𝒪  X  ×       ℳ   superscript   subscript  𝒪  X       \mathcal{M}=\mathcal{O}_{X}^{\times}   and   α   α   \alpha   to be the identity.    The motivating example for the definition of log structure comes from semistable schemes. Let X be a scheme,    j  :   U  →  X      normal-:  j   normal-→  U  X     j\colon U\to X   the inclusion of an open subscheme of X , with complement    D  =   X  -  U       D    X  U     D=X-U   a divisor with normal crossings . Then there is a log structure associated to this situation, which is    ℳ  =    𝒪  X   ∩    j  *    𝒪  U  ×         ℳ     subscript  𝒪  X      subscript  j     superscript   subscript  𝒪  U         \mathcal{M}=\mathcal{O}_{X}\cap j_{*}\mathcal{O}_{U}^{\times}   , with   α   α   \alpha   simply the inclusion morphism into    𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   . This is called the canonical (or standard ) log structure on X associated to D .    Let R be a discrete valuation ring , with residue field k and fraction field K . Then the canonical log structure on    Spec   (  R  )       Spec  R    \mathrm{Spec}(R)   consists of the inclusion of    R  ∖   {  0  }       R   0     R\setminus\{0\}   (and not    R  ×     superscript  R     R^{\times}   !) inside   R   R   R   . This is in fact an instance of the previous construction, but taking    j  :    Spec   (  K  )    →   Spec   (  R  )        normal-:  j   normal-→    Spec  K     Spec  R      j\colon\mathrm{Spec}(K)\to\mathrm{Spec}(R)   .    With R as above, one can also define the hollow log structure on    Spec   (  R  )       Spec  R    \mathrm{Spec}(R)   by taking the same sheaf of monoids as previously, but instead sending the maximal ideal of R to 0.   Applications  One application of log structures is the ability to define logarithmic forms on any log scheme. From this, one can for instance define corresponding notions of log-smoothness and log-étaleness which parallel the usual definitions for schemes. This then allows the study of deformation theory .  In addition, log structures serve to define the mixed Hodge structure on any smooth variety X , by taking a compactification with boundary a normal crossings divisor D , and writing down the Hodge–De Rham complex associated to X with the standard log structure defined by D . 2  Log objects also naturally appear as the objects at the boundary of moduli spaces , i.e. from degenerations.  Log geometry also allows the definition of log-crystalline cohomology , an analogue of crystalline cohomology which has good behaviour for varieties that are not necessarily smooth, only log smooth. This then has application to the theory of Galois representations , and particularly semistable Galois representations.
