   Credal set      Credal set   A credal set is a set of probability distributions 1 or, equivalently, a set of probability measures . A credal set is often assumed or constructed to be a closed  convex set . It is intended to express uncertainty or doubt about the probability model that should be used, or to convey the beliefs of a Bayesian agent about the possible states of the world. 2  Let   X   X   X   denote a categorical variable ,    P   (  X  )       P  X    P(X)   a probability mass function over   X   X   X   , and    K   (  X  )       K  X    K(X)   a credal set over   X   X   X   . If    K   (  X  )       K  X    K(X)   is convex, the credal set can be equivalently described by its extreme points    ext   [   K   (  X  )    ]       ext   delimited-[]    K  X      \mathrm{ext}[K(X)]   . The expectation for a function   f   f   f   of   X   X   X   with respect to the credal set    K   (  X  )       K  X    K(X)   can be characterised only by its lower and upper bounds. For the lower bound,         E  ¯    [  f  ]    =    min    P   (  X  )    ∈   K   (  X  )        ∑  x    f   (  x  )   P   (  x  )       .         normal-¯  E    delimited-[]  f       subscript       P  X     K  X       subscript   x     f  x  P  x       \underline{E}[f]=\min_{P(X)\in K(X)}\sum_{x}f(x)P(x).   Notably, such an inference problem can be equivalently obtained by considering only the extreme points of the credal set.  It is easy to see that a credal set over a Boolean variable cannot have more than two vertices, while no bounds can be provided for credal sets over variables with three or more values.
