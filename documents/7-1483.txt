Cole–Cole equation

The Cole–Cole equation is a relaxation model that is often used to describe dielectric relaxation in polymers.
It is given by the equation


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the complex dielectric constant, 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the "static" and "infinite frequency" dielectric constants, 
 
 
 
  is the angular frequency and 
 
 
 
  is a time constant.
The exponent parameter 
 
 
 
 , which takes a value between 0 and 1, allows to describe different spectral shapes. When 
 
 
 
 
 , the Cole-Cole model reduces to the Debye model. When 
 
 
 
 , the relaxation is stretched, i.e. it extends over a wider range on a logarithmic 
 
 
 
  scale than Debye relaxation.
Cole-Cole relaxation constitutes a special case of Havriliak-Negami relaxation when the symmetry parameter (β) is equal to 1 - that is, when the relaxation peaks are symmetric. Another special case of Havriliak-Negami relaxation (β
