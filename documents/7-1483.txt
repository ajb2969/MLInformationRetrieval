   Cole–Cole equation      Cole–Cole equation   The Cole–Cole equation is a relaxation model that is often used to describe dielectric relaxation in polymers .  It is given by the equation         ε  *    (  ω  )    -   ε  ∞    =     ε  s   -   ε  ∞     1  +    (   i  ω  τ   )    1  -  α               superscript  ε    ω    subscript  ε          subscript  ε  s    subscript  ε       1   superscript    i  ω  τ     1  α        \varepsilon^{*}(\omega)-\varepsilon_{\infty}=\frac{\varepsilon_{s}-\varepsilon%
 _{\infty}}{1+(i\omega\tau)^{1-\alpha}}   where    ε  *     superscript  ε     \varepsilon^{*}   is the complex dielectric constant ,    ε  s     subscript  ε  s    \varepsilon_{s}   and    ε  ∞     subscript  ε     \varepsilon_{\infty}   are the "static" and "infinite frequency" dielectric constants,   ω   ω   \omega   is the angular frequency and   τ   τ   \tau   is a time constant.  The exponent parameter   α   α   \alpha   , which takes a value between 0 and 1, allows to describe different spectral shapes. When    α  =  0      α  0    \alpha=0   , the Cole-Cole model reduces to the Debye model. When    α  >  0      α  0    \alpha>0   , the relaxation is stretched , i.e. it extends over a wider range on a logarithmic   ω   ω   \omega   scale than Debye relaxation.  Cole-Cole relaxation constitutes a special case of Havriliak-Negami relaxation when the symmetry parameter (β) is equal to 1 - that is, when the relaxation peaks are symmetric.
