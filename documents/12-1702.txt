   Condensation lemma      Condensation lemma   In set theory , a branch of mathematics, the condensation lemma is a result about sets in the constructible universe .  It states that if X is a transitive set and is an elementary submodel of some level of the constructible hierarchy L α , that is,     (  X  ,  ∈  )   ≺   (   L  α   ,  ∈  )      precedes   X      subscript  L  α       (X,\in)\prec(L_{\alpha},\in)   , then in fact there is some ordinal    β  ≤  α      β  α    \beta\leq\alpha   such that    X  =   L  β       X   subscript  L  β     X=L_{\beta}   .  More can be said: If X is not transitive, then its transitive collapse is equal to some    L  β     subscript  L  β    L_{\beta}   , and the hypothesis of elementarity can be weakened to elementarity only for formulas which are    Σ  1     subscript  normal-Σ  1    \Sigma_{1}   in the Lévy hierarchy . Also, the assumption that X be transitive automatically holds when    α  =   ω  1       α   subscript  ω  1     \alpha=\omega_{1}   .  The lemma was formulated and proved by Kurt Gödel in his proof that the axiom of constructibility implies GCH .
