   GGH encryption scheme      GGH encryption scheme   The Goldreich–Goldwasser–Halevi (GGH)  lattice-based  cryptosystem is an asymmetric cryptosystem based on lattices . There is also a GGH signature scheme .  The Goldreich–Goldwasser–Halevi (GGH) cryptosystem makes use of the fact that the closest vector problem can be a hard problem. It was published in 1997 and uses a trapdoor one-way function that is relying on the difficulty of lattice reduction. The idea included in this trapdoor function is that, given any basis for a lattice, it is easy to generate a vector which is close to a lattice point, for example taking a lattice point and adding a small error vector. But to return from this erroneous vector to the original lattice point a special basis is needed.  The GGH encryption scheme was cryptanalyzed in 1999 by Phong Q. Nguyen.  Operation  GGH involves a private key and a public key.  The private key is a basis   B   B   B   of a lattice   L   L   L   with good properties (such as short nearly orthogonal vectors) and a unimodular matrix    U   U   U   .  The public key is another basis of the lattice   L   L   L   of the form     B  ′   =   U  B        superscript  B  normal-′     U  B     B^{\prime}=UB   .  For some chosen M, the message space consists of the vector    (   λ  1   ,  …  ,   λ  n   )      subscript  λ  1   normal-…   subscript  λ  n     (\lambda_{1},...,\lambda_{n})   in the range     -  M   <   λ  i   <  M          M    subscript  λ  i        M     -M<\lambda_{i}   .  Encryption  Given a message    m  =   (   λ  1   ,  …  ,   λ  n   )       m    subscript  λ  1   normal-…   subscript  λ  n      m=(\lambda_{1},...,\lambda_{n})   , error   e   e   e   , and a public key    B  ′     superscript  B  normal-′    B^{\prime}   compute      v  =   ∑    λ  i    b  i  ′         v       subscript  λ  i    superscript   subscript  b  i   normal-′       v=\sum\lambda_{i}b_{i}^{\prime}     In matrix notation this is      v  =   m  ⋅   B  ′        v   normal-⋅  m   superscript  B  normal-′      v=m\cdot B^{\prime}   .  Remember   m   m   m   consists of integer values, and    b  ′     superscript  b  normal-′    b^{\prime}   is a lattice point, so v is also a lattice point. The ciphertext is then      c  =   v  +  e   =    m  ⋅   B  ′    +  e         c    v  e           normal-⋅  m   superscript  B  normal-′    e      c=v+e=m\cdot B^{\prime}+e     Decryption  To decrypt the cyphertext one computes       c  ⋅   B   -  1     =    (    m  ⋅   B  ′    +  e   )    B   -  1     =    m  ⋅  U  ⋅  B  ⋅   B   -  1     +   e  ⋅   B   -  1      =    m  ⋅  U   +   e  ⋅   B   -  1             normal-⋅  c   superscript  B    1          normal-⋅  m   superscript  B  normal-′    e    superscript  B    1             normal-⋅  m  U  B   superscript  B    1      normal-⋅  e   superscript  B    1              normal-⋅  m  U    normal-⋅  e   superscript  B    1         c\cdot B^{-1}=(m\cdot B^{\prime}+e)B^{-1}=m\cdot U\cdot B\cdot B^{-1}+e\cdot B%
 ^{-1}=m\cdot U+e\cdot B^{-1}     The Babai rounding technique will be used to remove the term    e  ⋅   B   -  1       normal-⋅  e   superscript  B    1      e\cdot B^{-1}   as long as it is small enough. Finally compute      m  =   m  ⋅  U  ⋅   U   -  1         m   normal-⋅  m  U   superscript  U    1       m=m\cdot U\cdot U^{-1}     to get the messagetext.  Example  Let    L  ⊂   ℝ  2       L   superscript  ℝ  2     L\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}   be a lattice with the basis   B   B   B   and its inverse    B   -  1      superscript  B    1     B^{-1}         B  =   (     7    0      0    3     )       B    7  0    0  3      B=\begin{pmatrix}7&0\\
 0&3\\
 \end{pmatrix}   and     B   -  1    =   (      1  7     0      0     1  3      )        superscript  B    1        1  7   0    0    1  3       B^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{1}{7}&0\\
 0&\frac{1}{3}\\
 \end{pmatrix}     With      U  =   (     2    3      3    5     )       U    2  3    3  5      U=\begin{pmatrix}2&3\\
 3&5\\
 \end{pmatrix}   and       U   -  1    =   (     5     -  3        -  3     2     )        superscript  U    1      5    3       3   2      U^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}5&-3\\
 -3&2\\
 \end{pmatrix}     this gives       B  ′   =   U  B   =   (     14    9      21    15     )          superscript  B  normal-′     U  B          14  9    21  15       B^{\prime}=UB=\begin{pmatrix}14&9\\
 21&15\\
 \end{pmatrix}     Let the message be    m  =   (  3  ,   -  7   )       m   3    7      m=(3,-7)   and the error vector    e  =   (  1  ,   -  1   )       e   1    1      e=(1,-1)   . Then the ciphertext is       c  =    m   B  ′    +  e   =   (   -  104   ,   -  79   )    .        c      m   superscript  B  normal-′    e           104     79       c=mB^{\prime}+e=(-104,-79).\,     To decrypt one must compute        c   B   -  1     =   (    -  104   7   ,    -  79   3   )    .        c   superscript  B    1          104   7       79   3      cB^{-1}=\left(\frac{-104}{7},\frac{-79}{3}\right).     This is rounded to    (   -  15   ,   -  26   )       15     26     (-15,-26)   and the message is recovered with       m  =    (   -  15   ,   -  26   )    U   -  1     =   (  3  ,   -  7   )    .        m       15     26     superscript  U    1           3    7       m=(-15,-26)U^{-1}=(3,-7).\,     Security of the scheme  1999 Nguyen showed at the Crypto conference that the GGH encryption scheme has a flaw in the design of the schemes. He showed that every ciphertext reveals information about the plaintext and that the problem of decryption could be turned into a special closest vector problem much easier to solve than the general CVP.
