It can be seen as a truncation of the regular 24-cell honeycomb , containing tesseract and truncated 24-cell cells.  It has a uniform alternation , called the snub 24-cell honeycomb . It is a snub from the     D  ~   4     subscript   normal-~  D   4    {\tilde{D}}_{4}   construction. This truncated 24-cell has Schläfli symbol t{3 1,1,1,1 }, and its snub is represented as s{3 1,1,1,1 }.  Alternate names   Truncated icositetrachoric tetracomb  Truncated icositetrachoric honeycomb  Cantitruncated 16-cell honeycomb  Bicantitruncated tesseractic honeycomb   Symmetry constructions  There are five different symmetry constructions of this tessellation. Each symmetry can be represented by different arrangements of colored truncated 24-cell facets. In all cases, four truncated 24-cells, and one tesseract meet at each vertex, but the vertex figures have different symmetry generators.
