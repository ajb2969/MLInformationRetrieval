   Abraham Ziv      Abraham Ziv   Abraham Ziv (–) was an Israeli mathematician, known for his contributions to Zero-sum problem as part of the discoverers of the Erdős–Ginzburg–Ziv theorem .  Life  He was born in Avihayil , Israel in the 1940s to Haim and Zila Zubkovski. Like many other Israeli-Jews of his time, he changed his surname in the '50s to Ziv, as part of the popular Hebraization of surnames movement. Abraham studied at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology , where he earned his Ph.D, in mathematics, after receiving his Master's degree from Harvard University a few years earlier. In 1961, at the age of 21, he proved along with Paul Erdős and Abraham Ginzburg the general result that every sequence of     2  n   -  1        2  n   1    2n-1   elements of     ℤ  /  n   ℤ        ℤ  n   ℤ    \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}   contains   n   n   n   terms that sum to zero. 1 This joint paper with Erdős gives him an Erdős number of 1. 2  In 1972 Ziv was part of the founding team of IBM R&D; Labs in Israel , where he stayed until retirement. In his time at IBM he wrote 21 more publications 3 and 6 patents that are still owned by IBM to this day. 4  Academic papers     References  External links    PlanetMath Erdős, Ginzburg, Ziv Theorem   "  Category:20th-century mathematicians  Category:Israeli Jews  Category:Israeli mathematicians  Category:1940 births  Category:2013 deaths  Category:Harvard University alumni     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
