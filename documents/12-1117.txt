   Primitive element (finite field)      Primitive element (finite field)   In field theory , a primitive element of a finite field  GF ( q ) is a generator of the multiplicative group of the field. In other words,    α  ∈   GF   (  q  )        α    GF  q     \alpha\in\mathrm{GF}(q)   is called a primitive element if it is a primitive ( q -1) root of unity in GF ( q ); this means that all the non-zero elements of    GF   (  q  )       GF  q    \mathrm{GF}(q)   can be written as    α  i     superscript  α  i    \alpha^{i}   for some (positive) integer   i   i   i   .  For example, 2 is a primitive element of the field GF ( 3 ) and GF ( 5 ), but not of GF ( 7 ) since it generates the cyclic subgroup of order 3 {2,4,1}; however, 3 is a primitive element of GF ( 7 ). The minimal polynomial of a primitive element is a primitive polynomial .  Properties  Number of Primitive Elements  The number of primitive elements in a finite field GF ( q ) is φ ( q - 1), where φ ( m ) is Euler's totient function , which counts the number of elements less than or equal to m which are relatively prime to m . This can be proved by using the theorem that the multiplicative group of a finite field GF ( q ) is cyclic of order q - 1, and the fact that a finite cyclic group of order m contains φ ( m ) generators.
