4-Coumarate-CoA ligase

In enzymology, a 4-coumarate-CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + 4-coumarate + CoA 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + 4-coumaroyl-CoA
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, 4-coumarate, and CoA, whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and 4-coumaroyl-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, to be specific those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming). Other names in common use include 4-coumaroyl-CoA synthetase, p-coumaroyl CoA ligase, p-coumaryl coenzyme A synthetase, p-coumaryl-CoA synthetase, p-coumaryl-CoA ligase, feruloyl CoA ligase, hydroxycinnamoyl CoA synthetase, 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase, caffeolyl coenzyme A synthetase, p-hydroxycinnamoyl coenzyme A synthetase, feruloyl coenzyme A synthetase, sinapoyl coenzyme A synthetase, 4-coumaryl-CoA synthetase, hydroxycinnamate:CoA ligase, p-coumaryl-CoA ligase, p-hydroxycinnamic acid:CoA ligase, and 4CL. This enzyme participates in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.
