Virtual metrology
In [[Semiconductor device fabrication|semiconductor manufacturing]], '''virtual metrology''' refers to methods to predict properties of a [[Wafe
 r (electronics)|wafer]] based on machine parameters and sensor data of the production equipment, without performing the (costly) physical measurement of the wafer properties. Statistical methods such as classification and regression are used to perform such a task. An example is the prediction of the silicon nitride (
 
 
 
 ) layer thickness in the  chemical vapor deposition process (CVD), using multivariate regression methods.1
