Rational reciprocity law

In number theory, a rational reciprocity law is a reciprocity law involving residue symbols that are related by a factor of +1 or â€“1 rather than a general root of unity.
As an example, there are rational biquadratic and octic reciprocity laws. Define the symbol (x|p)k to be +1 if x is a k-th power modulo the prime p and -1 otherwise.
Let p and q be distinct primes congruent to 1 modulo 4, such that (p|q)2 = (q|p)2 = +1. Let p = a2 + b2 and q = A2 + B2 with aA odd. Then



If in addition p and q are congruent to 1 modulo 8, let p = c2 + 2d2 and q = C2 + 2D2. Then
