   Landweber exact functor theorem      Landweber exact functor theorem   In mathematics, the Landweber exact functor theorem , named after Peter Landweber , is a theorem in algebraic topology . It is known that a complex orientation of a homology theory leads to a formal group law . The Landweber exact functor theorem (or LEFT for short) can be seen as a method to reverse this process: it constructs a homology theory out of a formal group law.  Statement  The coefficient ring of complex cobordism is     M   U  *    (  *  )    =   M   U  *    ≅   ℤ   [   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ]            M   subscript  U        M   subscript  U            ℤ    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…       MU_{*}(*)=MU_{*}\cong\mathbb{Z}[x_{1},x_{2},\dots]   , where the degree of    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   is 2i. This is isomorphic to the graded Lazard ring     L  *     subscript  L     \mathcal{}L_{*}   . This means that giving a formal group law F (of degree −2) over a graded ring    R  *     subscript  R     \mathcal{}R_{*}   is equivalent to giving a graded ring morphism     L  *   →   R  *      normal-→   subscript  L     subscript  R      L_{*}\to R_{*}   . Multiplication by an integer n >0 is defined inductively as a power series, by         [   n  +  1   ]   F   x   =   F   (  x  ,     [  n  ]   F   x   )           superscript   delimited-[]    n  1    F   x     F   x     superscript   delimited-[]  n   F   x       [n+1]^{F}x=F(x,[n]^{F}x)   and        [  1  ]   F   x   =  x   .         superscript   delimited-[]  1   F   x   x    [1]^{F}x=x.     Let now F be a formal group law over a ring    R  *     subscript  R     \mathcal{}R_{*}   . Define for a topological space  X        E  *    (  X  )    =    M   U  *    (  X  )     ⊗   M   U  *      R  *           subscript  E    X     subscript  tensor-product    M   subscript  U        M   subscript  U    X    subscript  R       E_{*}(X)=MU_{*}(X)\otimes_{MU_{*}}R_{*}   Here    R  *     subscript  R     \mathcal{}R_{*}   gets its    M   U  *       M   subscript  U      \mathcal{}MU_{*}   -algebra structure via F. The question is: is E a homology theory? It is obviously a homotopy invariant functor, which fulfills excision. The problem is that tensoring in general does not preserve exact sequences. One could demand that    R  *     subscript  R     \mathcal{}R_{*}   is flat over    M   U  *       M   subscript  U      \mathcal{}MU_{*}   , but that would be too strong in practice. Peter Landweber found another criterion:   Theorem (Landweber exact functor theorem)  For every prime p, there are elements      v  1   ,   v  2   ,  ⋯   ∈   M   U  *          subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2   normal-⋯     M   subscript  U       v_{1},v_{2},\cdots\in MU_{*}   such that we have the following: Suppose that    M  *     subscript  M     \mathcal{}M_{*}   is a graded    M   U  *       M   subscript  U      \mathcal{}MU_{*}   -module and the sequence    (  p  ,   v  1   ,   v  2   ,  …  ,   v  n   )     p   subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2   normal-…   subscript  v  n     (p,v_{1},v_{2},\dots,v_{n})   is regular for M , for every p and n . Then       E  *    (  X  )    =    M   U  *    (  X  )     ⊗   M   U  *      M  *           subscript  E    X     subscript  tensor-product    M   subscript  U        M   subscript  U    X    subscript  M       E_{*}(X)=MU_{*}(X)\otimes_{MU_{*}}M_{*}      is a homology theory on CW-complexes .   In particular, every formal group law F over a ring R yields a module over    M   U  *       M   subscript  U      \mathcal{}MU_{*}   since we get via F a ring morphism     M   U  *    →  R     normal-→    M   subscript  U     R    MU_{*}\to R   .  Remarks   There is also a version for Brown–Peterson cohomology BP. The spectrum BP is a direct summand of    M   U   (  p  )        M   subscript  U  p     MU_{(p)}   with coefficients     ℤ   (  p  )     [   v  1   ,   v  2   ,  …  ]        subscript  ℤ  p     subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2   normal-…     \mathbb{Z}_{(p)}[v_{1},v_{2},\dots]   . The statement of the LEFT stays true if one fixes a prime p and substitutes BP for MU.    The classical proof of the LEFT uses the Landweber–Morava invariant ideal theorem: the only prime ideals of    B   P  *       B   subscript  P      \mathcal{}BP_{*}   which are invariant under coaction of    B   P  *   B  P      B   subscript  P    B  P    \mathcal{}BP_{*}BP   are the     I  n   =   (  p  ,   v  1   ,  …  ,   v  n   )        subscript  I  n    p   subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  n      I_{n}=(p,v_{1},\dots,v_{n})   . This allows to check flatness only against the     B   P  *    /   I  n         B   subscript  P      subscript  I  n     \mathcal{}BP_{*}/I_{n}   (see Landweber, 1976).    The LEFT can be strengthened as follows: let    ℰ  *     subscript  ℰ     \mathcal{E}_{*}   be the (homotopy) category of Landweber exact    M   U  *       M   subscript  U      \mathcal{}MU_{*}   -modules and   ℰ   ℰ   \mathcal{E}   the category of MU-module spectra M such that     π  *   M       subscript  π    M    \mathcal{}\pi_{*}M   is Landweber exact. Then the functor     π  *   :   ℰ  →   ℰ  *       normal-:   subscript  π     normal-→  ℰ   subscript  ℰ       \pi_{*}:\mathcal{E}\to\mathcal{E}_{*}   is an equivalence of categories. The inverse functor (given by the LEFT) takes    M   U  *       M   subscript  U      \mathcal{}MU_{*}   -algebras to (homotopy) MU-algebra spectra (see Hovey, Strickland, 1999, Thm 2.7).   Examples  The archetypical and first known (non-trivial) example is complex K-theory K. Complex K-theory is complex oriented and has as formal group law    x  +  y  +   x  y       x  y    x  y     x+y+xy   . The corresponding morphism     M   U  *    →   K  *      normal-→    M   subscript  U      subscript  K      MU_{*}\to K_{*}   is also known as the Todd genus . We have then an isomorphism         K  *    (  X  )    =    M   U  *    (  X  )     ⊗   M   U  *      K  *     ,         subscript  K    X     subscript  tensor-product    M   subscript  U        M   subscript  U    X    subscript  K       K_{*}(X)=MU_{*}(X)\otimes_{MU_{*}}K_{*},   called the Conner–Floyd isomorphism .  While complex K-theory was constructed before by geometric means, many homology theories were first constructed via the Landweber exact functor theorem. This includes elliptic homology , the Johnson–Wilson theories     E   (  n  )       E  n    E(n)   and the Lubin–Tate spectra     E  n     subscript  E  n    E_{n}   .  While homology with rational coefficients    H  ℚ      H  ℚ    H\mathbb{Q}   is Landweber exact, homology with integer coefficients    H  ℤ      H  ℤ    H\mathbb{Z}   is not Landweber exact. Furthermore, Morava K-theory K(n) is not Landweber exact.  Modern reformulation  A module M over    M   U  *       M   subscript  U      \mathcal{}MU_{*}   is the same as a quasi-coherent sheaf    ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   over    Spec  L      Spec  L    \text{Spec }L   , where L is the Lazard ring. If    M  =   M   U  *    (  X  )        M    M   subscript  U    X     M=\mathcal{}MU_{*}(X)   , then M has the extra datum of a    M   U  *   M  U      M   subscript  U    M  U    \mathcal{}MU_{*}MU   coaction. A coaction on the ring level corresponds to that   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   is an equivariant sheaf with respect to an action of an affine group scheme G. It is a theorem of Quillen that    G  ≅    \Z    [   b  1   ,   b  2   ,  …  ]        G    \Z    subscript  b  1    subscript  b  2   normal-…      G\cong\Z[b_{1},b_{2},\dots]   and assigns to every ring R the group of power series       g   (  t  )    =   t  +    b  1    t  2    +    b  2    t  3    +  ⋯   ∈   R   [   [  t  ]   ]            g  t     t     subscript  b  1    superscript  t  2       subscript  b  2    superscript  t  3    normal-⋯          R   delimited-[]   delimited-[]  t        g(t)=t+b_{1}t^{2}+b_{2}t^{3}+\cdots\in R[[t]]   . It acts on the set of formal group laws    Spec  L   (  R  )       Spec  L  R    \text{Spec }L(R)   via       F   (  x  ,  y  )    ↦   g  F   (    g   -  1    x   ,    g   -  1    y   )       maps-to    F   x  y      g  F      superscript  g    1    x      superscript  g    1    y       F(x,y)\mapsto gF(g^{-1}x,g^{-1}y)   . These are just the coordinate changes of formal group laws. Therefore, one can identify the stack quotient    Spec  L  /  /  G     fragments  Spec  L    G    \text{Spec }L//G   with the stack of (1-dimensional) formal groups     ℳ   f  g      subscript  ℳ    f  g     \mathcal{M}_{fg}   and    M  =   M   U  *    (  X  )        M    M   subscript  U    X     \mathcal{}M=MU_{*}(X)   defines a quasi-coherent sheaf over this stack. Now it is quite easy to see that it suffices that M defines a quasi-coherent sheaf   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   which is flat over    ℳ   f  g      subscript  ℳ    f  g     \mathcal{M}_{fg}   in order that     M   U  *    (  X  )     ⊗   M   U  *     M      subscript  tensor-product    M   subscript  U        M   subscript  U    X   M    MU_{*}(X)\otimes_{MU_{*}}M   is a homology theory. The Landweber exactness theorem can then be interpreted as a flatness criterion for    ℳ   f  g      subscript  ℳ    f  g     \mathcal{M}_{fg}   (see Lurie 2010).  Refinements to    E  ∞     subscript  E     E_{\infty}   -ring spectra  While the LEFT is known to produce (homotopy) ring spectra out of    M   U  *       M   subscript  U      \mathcal{}MU_{*}   , it is a much more delicate question to understand when these spectra are actually     E  ∞     subscript  E     E_{\infty}   -ring spectra . As of 2010, the best progress was made by Jacob Lurie . If X is an algebraic stack and    X  →   ℳ   f  g       normal-→  X   subscript  ℳ    f  g      X\to\mathcal{M}_{fg}   a flat map of stacks, the discussion above shows that we get a presheaf of (homotopy) ring spectra on X. If this map factors over     M  p    (  n  )        subscript  M  p   n    M_{p}(n)   (the stack of 1-dimensional p-divisible groups of height n) and the map    X  →    M  p    (  n  )       normal-→  X     subscript  M  p   n     X\to M_{p}(n)   is etale , then this presheaf can be refined to a sheaf of    E  ∞     subscript  E     E_{\infty}   -ring spectra (see Goerss). This theorem is important for the construction of topological modular forms .  References   P.
