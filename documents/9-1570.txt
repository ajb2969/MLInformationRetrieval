   Carathéodory metric      Carathéodory metric   In mathematics , the Carathéodory metric is a metric defined on the open  unit ball of a complex  Banach space that has many similar properties to the Poincaré metric of hyperbolic geometry . It is named after the Greek  mathematician  Constantin Carathéodory .  Definition  Let ( X , || ||) be a complex Banach space and let B be the open unit ball in X . Let Δ denote the open unit disc in the complex plane  C , thought of as the Poincaré disc model for 2-dimensional real/1-dimensional complex hyperbolic geometry. Let the Poincaré metric ρ on Δ be given by       ρ   (  a  ,  b  )    =    tanh   -  1      |   a  -  b   |    |   1  -    a  ¯   b    |           ρ   a  b      superscript     1          a  b        1     normal-¯  a   b         \rho(a,b)=\tanh^{-1}\frac{|a-b|}{|1-\bar{a}b|}     (thus fixing the curvature to be −4). Then the Carathéodory metric  d on B is defined by        d   (  x  ,  y  )    =   sup   {   ρ   (   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  y  )    )    |   f  :   B  →   Δ  is holomorphic     }     .        d   x  y     supremum   conditional-set    ρ     f  x     f  y      normal-:  f   normal-→  B    normal-Δ  is holomorphic         d(x,y)=\sup\{\rho(f(x),f(y))|f:B\to\Delta\mbox{ is holomorphic}\}.     What it means for a function on a Banach space to be holomorphic is defined in the article on Infinite dimensional holomorphy .  Properties   For any point x in B ,           d   (  0  ,  x  )    =   ρ   (  0  ,   ∥  x  ∥   )     .        d   0  x      ρ   0   norm  x       d(0,x)=\rho(0,\|x\|).         d can also be given by the following formula, which Carathéodory attributed to Erhard Schmidt :          d   (  x  ,  y  )    =   sup   {   2    tanh   -  1     ∥     f   (  x  )    -   f   (  y  )     2   ∥     |   f  :   B  →   Δ  is holomorphic     }          d   x  y     supremum   conditional-set    2    superscript     1     norm        f  x     f  y    2       normal-:  f   normal-→  B    normal-Δ  is holomorphic         d(x,y)=\sup\left\{\left.2\tanh^{-1}\left\|\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{2}\right\|\right|f:%
 B\to\Delta\mbox{ is holomorphic}\right\}         For all a and b in B ,          ∥   a  -  b   ∥   ≤    2   tanh    d   (  a  ,  b  )    2     ,   (  1  )         norm    a  b       2        d   a  b    2     1     \|a-b\|\leq 2\tanh\frac{d(a,b)}{2},\qquad\qquad(1)         with equality if and only if either a = b or there exists a bounded linear functional ℓ ∈ X ∗ such that ||ℓ|| = 1, ℓ( a + b ) = 0 and           ρ   (   ℓ   (  a  )    ,   ℓ   (  b  )    )    =   d   (  a  ,  b  )     .        ρ     normal-ℓ  a     normal-ℓ  b       d   a  b      \rho(\ell(a),\ell(b))=d(a,b).         Moreover, any ℓ satisfying these three conditions has |ℓ( a − b )| = || a − b ||.    Also, there is equality in (1) if || a || = || b || and || a − b || = || a || + || b ||. One way to do this is to take b = − a .    If there exists a unit vector u in X that is not an extreme point of the closed unit ball in X , then there exist points a and b in B such that there is equality in (1) but b ≠ ± a .   Carathéodory length of a tangent vector  There is an associated notion of Carathéodory length for tangent vectors to the ball B . Let x be a point of B and let v be a tangent vector to B at x ; since B is the open unit ball in the vector space X , the tangent space T x B can be identified with X in a natural way, and v can be thought of as an element of X . Then the Carathéodory length of v at x , denoted α ( x , v ), is defined by        α   (  x  ,  v  )    =   sup   {   |   D  f   (  x  )   v   |   |   f  :   B  →   Δ  is holomorphic     }     .        α   x  v     supremum   conditional-set      normal-D  f  x  v     normal-:  f   normal-→  B    normal-Δ  is holomorphic         \alpha(x,v)=\sup\big\{|\mathrm{D}f(x)v|\big|f:B\to\Delta\mbox{ is holomorphic}%
 \big\}.     One can show that α ( x , v ) ≥ || v ||, with equality when x = 0.  See also   Earle–Hamilton fixed point theorem   References     "  Category:Hyperbolic geometry  Category:Metric geometry
