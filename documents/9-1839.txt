   Compact complement topology      Compact complement topology   In mathematics , the compact complement topology is a topology defined on the set   ℝ   ℝ   \scriptstyle\mathbb{R}   of real numbers , defined by declaring a subset     X  ⊆  ℝ      X  ℝ    \scriptstyle X\subseteq\mathbb{R}    open  if and only if it is either empty or its complement     ℝ  ∖  X      ℝ  X    \scriptstyle\mathbb{R}\setminus X   is compact in the standard Euclidean topology on   ℝ   ℝ   \scriptstyle\mathbb{R}   .
