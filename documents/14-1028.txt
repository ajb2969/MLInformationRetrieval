   Cyclohedron      Cyclohedron   In geometry , the cyclohedron or Bott–Taubes polytope is a certain ( n − 1)-dimensional polytope that is useful in studying knot invariants .  The configuration space of n distinct points on the circle S 1 is an n -dimensional manifold , which can be compactified into a manifold with corners by allowing the points to approach each other. This compactification can be factored as     S  1   ×   W  n        superscript  S  1    subscript  W  n     S^{1}\times W_{n}   , where W n is the cyclohedron .
