Cyclohedron

 In geometry, the cyclohedron or Bott–Taubes polytope is a certain (n − 1)-dimensional polytope that is useful in studying knot invariants.
The configuration space of n distinct points on the circle S1 is an n-dimensional manifold, which can be compactified into a manifold with corners by allowing the points to approach each other. This compactification can be factored as 
 
 
 
 , where Wn is the cyclohedron.
