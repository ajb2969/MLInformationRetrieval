   Monomial basis      Monomial basis   In mathematics the monomial basis of a polynomial ring is its basis (as vector space or free module over the field or ring of coefficients) that consists in the set of all monomials. The monomials form a basis because every polynomial may be uniquely written as a finite linear combination of monomials (this is an immediate consequence of the definition of a polynomial).  One indeterminate  The polynomial ring     K  x  x      K  x  x    Kxx   of the univariate polynomial over a field   K   K   K   is a   K   K   K   -vector space, which has      1  ,  x  ,   x  2   ,   x  3   ,  …     1  x   superscript  x  2    superscript  x  3   normal-…    1,x,x^{2},x^{3},\ldots   as an (infinite) basis. More generally, if   K   K   K   is a ring ,    K  x  x      K  x  x    Kxx   is a free module , which has the same basis.  The polynomials of degree at most   d   d   d   form also a vector space (or a free module in the case of a ring of coefficients), which has      1  ,  x  ,   x  2   ,  …     1  x   superscript  x  2   normal-…    1,x,x^{2},\ldots     as a basis  The canonical form of a polynomial is its expression on this basis:        a  0   +    a  1   x   +    a  2    x  2    +  …  +    a  d    x  d     ,       subscript  a  0      subscript  a  1   x      subscript  a  2    superscript  x  2    normal-…     subscript  a  d    superscript  x  d      a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+\ldots+a_{d}x^{d},     or, using the shorter sigma notation :        ∑   i  =  0   d     a  i    x  i     .      superscript   subscript     i  0    d      subscript  a  i    superscript  x  i      \sum_{i=0}^{d}a_{i}x^{i}.     The monomial basis in naturally totally ordered , either by increasing degrees        x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n    ,      subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{1},\ldots,x_{n},     Several indeterminates  In the case of several indeterminates      x  1   d  1     x  2   d  2    ⋯   x  n   d  n     ,       superscript   subscript  x  1    subscript  d  1     superscript   subscript  x  2    subscript  d  2    normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  x  n    subscript  d  n      x_{1}^{d_{1}}x_{2}^{d_{2}}\cdots x_{n}^{d_{n}},   a monomial is a product      d  i     subscript  d  i    d_{i}   where the      x  i  0   =  1   ,       superscript   subscript  x  i   0   1    x_{i}^{0}=1,   are non-negative integers . Note that, as    1  =    x  1  0    x  2  0   ⋯   x  n  0        1     superscript   subscript  x  1   0    superscript   subscript  x  2   0   normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  x  n   0      1=x_{1}^{0}x_{2}^{0}\cdots x_{n}^{0}   an exponent equal to zero means that the corresponding indeterminate does not appear in the monomial; in particular     x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n       subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}   is a monomial.  Similarly to the case of univariate polynomials, the polynomials in   d   d   d   form a vector space (if the coefficients belong to a field) or a free module (if the coefficients belong to a ring), which has the set of all monomials as a basis, called the monomial basis  The homogeneous polynomials of degree    d  =    d  1   +  ⋯  +   d  n        d     subscript  d  1   normal-⋯   subscript  d  n      d=d_{1}+\cdots+d_{n}   form a subspace which has the monomials of degree   d   d   d   as a basis. The dimension of this subspace is the number of monomials of degree      (       d  +  n   -  1       d     )   =    n   (   n  +  1   )   ⋯   (    n  +  d   -  1   )     d  !     ,       binomial      d  n   1   d       n    n  1   normal-⋯      n  d   1      d      {\left({{d+n-1}\atop{d}}\right)}=\frac{n(n+1)\cdots(n+d-1)}{d!},   , which is      (        d  +  n   -  1       d      )     binomial      d  n   1   d    {\left({{d+n-1}\atop{d}}\right)}   where   d   d   d   denotes a binomial coefficient .  The polynomials of degree at most   d   d   d   form also a subspace, which has the monomials of degree at most      (      d  +  n       d     )   =   (      d  +  n       n     )   =     (   d  +  1   )   ⋯   (   d  +  n   )     n  !     .         binomial    d  n   d    binomial    d  n   n              d  1   normal-⋯    d  n      n       {\left({{d+n}\atop{d}}\right)}={\left({{d+n}\atop{n}}\right)}=\frac{(d+1)%

Despite the univariate case, there is no natural total order of the monomial basis. For problem which require to choose a total order, such Gröbner basis computation, one generally chooses an admissible  monomial order that is a total order on the set of monomials such that      Π  4     subscript  normal-Π  4    \Pi_{4}   for every monomials    1  +  x  +   3   x  4        1  x    3   superscript  x  4      1+x+3x^{4}     Notes  A polynomial can always be converted into monomial form by calculating its Taylor expansion around 0.
