Minuscule 33 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), δ 48 (Soden),1 before French Revolution was called Codex Colbertinus 2844. It is a Greek minuscule manuscript of the New Testament on parchment, dated palaeographically to the 9th century.23 The manuscript is lacunose. It has marginalia. According to the textual critics it is one of the best minuscule manuscripts of the New Testament.
Description
The codex contains part of the Prophets of the Old Testament, and all the books of the New Testament (except Revelation of John), on 143 parchment leaves ({{×|37.5|24.8}}), with three lacunae in Gospel of Mark, and Gospel of Luke (Mark 9:31-11:11; 13:11-14:60; Luke 21:38-23:26).
The text is divided according to the  (chapters), whose numerals are given at the margin, and the τίτλοι (titles of chapters) at the top of the pages.
It contains Prolegomena to the Catholic epistles and the Pauline epistles (folios 73-76), the Euthalian Apparatus.
It is written on a parchment in minuscule, in 1 column per page, 48-52 lines per page. Part of almost of every leaf has been destroyed by dampness. The leaves were joined so firmly to each other — especially in the Book of Acts — that when separated, a part of the ink has adhered to the opposite page.4 Text is with errors of iotacism.5 The ends of the leaves are much damaged.6
The order of books: Gospels, Acts, Catholic epistles, Pauline epistles (Hebrews placed before 1 Timothy).7 Ending of the Epistle to the Romans has the following order of verses: 16:23; 16:25-27; 16:24 (as in codices P 104 256 263 365 436 459 1319 1573 1852 arm).

Verse Matthew 21:44 is omitted, as in manuscripts: 

104, Codex Bezae, some Old-Latin manuscripts (b, d, e, ff1, ff2, r1), syrs, and Diatessaron. This verse belongs to the possible Western non-interpolations. It does not contain text of Matthew 16:2b–3.

In Romans 8:1 it reads Ιησου κατα σαρκα περιπατουσιν αλλα κατα πνευμα, for Ιησου. The reading of the manuscript is supported by אc, Dc, K, P, 104, 181, 326, 330, (436 omit μη), 456, 614, 630, 1241, 1877, 1962, 1984, 1985, 2492, 2495, Byz, Lect.16

In 2 Timothy 1:11 it reads καὶ διάκονος (and servant), other manuscripts read καὶ διδάσκαλος (and teacher) or καὶ διδάσκαλος ἐθνῶν (and teacher of nations).21
Its Greek text of the Gospels is an excellent representative of the Alexandrian text-type, but with some Byzantine readings, particularly in Acts of the Apostles and the Pauline epistles.22 Aland placed it in Category II in Gospels and to Category I in rest of books of the New Testament.23 According to the Claremont Profile Method it represents the Alexandrian text-type as its weak member.24
History
Scholz and Martin dated the manuscript to the 11th century. Gregory dated it to the 9th or 10th century. Currently it is dated by the INTF to the 9th century.25
It was called "the queen of the cursives" by J. G. Eichhorn (1752-1827),26 but now it has several rivals (81, 892, 1175, 1739).27 The manuscript was examined by many scholars, such as Griesbach,28 who collated its text in Matthew 1-18. It was also studied by Birch and others. The text of the codex was fully collated by S. P. Tregelles in 1850. Tregelles said that, of all the manuscripts he collated (presumably excluding palimpsests), it was the hardest to read.
It was examined and described by Paulin Martin.29 C. R. Gregory saw the manuscript twice, in 1884 and in 1885.30
The manuscript was included to a critical apparatus by Kurt Aland in his 25th edition of Novum Testamentum Graece (1963).31
The codex is located now at the National Library of France (Cod. Gr. 14) at Paris.
