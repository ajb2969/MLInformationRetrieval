   Random regular graph      Random regular graph   A random r -regular graph is a graph selected from    ùí¢   n  ,  r      subscript  ùí¢   n  r     \mathcal{G}_{n,r}   , which denotes the probability space of all r -regular graphs on n vertices, where 3 ‚â§ r  B√©la Bollob√°s , Random Graphs , 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press (2001), section 2.4: Random Regular Graphs It is therefore a particular kind of random graph , but the regularity restriction significantly alters the properties that will hold, since most graphs are not regular.  Properties of random regular graphs  As with more general random graphs , it is possible to prove that certain properties of random r -regular graphs hold almost surely . In particular, for    r  ‚â•  3      r  3    r\geq 3   , a random r -regular graph of large size is almost surely r -connected . 1 In other words, although r -regular graphs with connectivity less than r exist, the probability of selecting such a graph tends to 0 as n increases.  If   œµ   œµ   \epsilon   > 0 is a positive constant, and d is the least integer satisfying        (   r  -  1   )    d  -  1    ‚â•    (   2  +  œµ   )   r  n   ln  n         superscript    r  1     d  1        2  œµ   r  n    n      (r-1)^{d-1}\geq(2+\epsilon)rn\ln n     then, almost surely, a random r -regular graph has diameter at most d . There is also a (more complex) lower bound on the diameter of r -regular graphs, so that almost all r -regular graphs (of the same size) have almost the same diameter. 2  The distribution of the number of short cycles is also known: for fixed m ‚â• 3, let Y 3 , Y 4 ,‚Ä¶, Y m be the number of cycles of lengths up to m . Then the Y i are asymptotically independent Poisson random variables with means 3      Œª  i   =     (   r  -  1   )   i    2  i         subscript  Œª  i      superscript    r  1   i     2  i      \lambda_{i}=\frac{(r-1)^{i}}{2i}     Algorithms for random regular graphs  It is non-trivial to implement the random selection of r -regular graphs efficiently and in an unbiased way, since most graphs are not regular. The pairing model (also configuration model ) is a method which takes nr points, and partitions them into n buckets with r points in each of them. Taking a random matching of the nr points, and then contracting the r points in each bucket into a single vertex, yields an r -regular graph or multigraph . If this object has no multiple edges or loops (i.e. it is a graph), then it is the required result. If not, a restart is required. 4  A refinement of this method was developed by Brendan McKay and Nicholas Wormald. 5  References  "  Category:Random graphs  Category:Regular graphs     Bollob√°s, section 7.6: Random Regular Graphs ‚Ü©  Bollob√°s, section 10.3: The Diameter of Random Regular Graphs ‚Ü©  Bollob√°s, section 2.4: Random Regular Graphs (Corollary 2.19) ‚Ü©  N.
