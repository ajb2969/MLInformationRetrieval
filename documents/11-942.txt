   Leucyltransferase      Leucyltransferase   In enzymology , a leucyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-leucyl-tRNA + protein   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   tRNA + L-leucyl-protein   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-leucyl-tRNA and protein , whereas its two products are tRNA and L-leucyl-protein .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the aminoacyltransferases . The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-leucyl-tRNA:protein leucyltransferase . Other names in common use include leucyl, phenylalanine-tRNA-protein transferase , leucyl-phenylalanine-transfer ribonucleate-protein , aminoacyltransferase , and leucyl-phenylalanine-transfer ribonucleate-protein transferase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, three structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
