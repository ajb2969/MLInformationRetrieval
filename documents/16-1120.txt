== Artinian rings == 
A simple Artinian ring A is a matrix ring over a division ring. Indeed,1 let I be a minimal (nonzero) right ideal of A. Then, since 
 
 
 
  is a two-sided ideal, 
 
 
 
  since A is simple. Thus, we can choose 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
 . Assume k is minimal with respect that property. Consider the map of right A-modules:


 
  It is surjective. If it is not injective, then, say, 
 
 
 
  with nonzero 
 
 
 
 . Then, by the minimality of I, we have
 
 
 
 . It follows:


 
 , which contradicts the minimality of k. Hence, 
 
 
 
  and thus 
 
 
 
 .
