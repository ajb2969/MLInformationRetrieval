   Hendrik van der Bijl      Hendrik van der Bijl   Dr Hendrik Johannes van der Bijl  FRS 1 (23 November 1887 – 2 December 1948) was a South African electrical engineer and industrialist. 2  He was the founding chairman of the Electricity Supply Commission (ESCOM, later to become Eskom ) in 1923. In 1927, he was the president of the South African Institute of Electrical Engineers (SAIEE). 3 Dr van der Bijl established the Iron and Steel Corporation of South Africa ( ISCOR ), and was its chairman for many years. The city of Vanderbijlpark , where ISCOR's major steel works was built and still operates, is named after him.  He was chancellor of the University of Pretoria from 1934 until 1948. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1944. 4  He is now perhaps best remembered for the van der Bijl equation which describes the relationship of the three 'constants' of a vacuum tube , the transconductance g m , the gain μ and the plate resistance r p or r a . The van der Bijl equation defines their relationship as follows:       g  m   =   μ   r  p         subscript  g  m     μ   subscript  r  p      g_{m}={\mu\over r_{p}}    5  References  "  Category:1887 births  Category:1948 deaths  Category:Afrikaner people  Category:White South African people  Category:South African people of Dutch descent  Category:South African electrical engineers  Category:Chancellors of the University of Pretoria  Category:Fellows of the Royal Society     ↩  Rosenthal, E: Southern African Dictionary of National Biography , Frederick Warne and Co.
