Edmonds matrix

In graph theory, the Edmonds matrix

 
  of a balanced bipartite graph

 
  with sets of vertices 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is defined by



where the xij are indeterminates. One application of the Edmonds matrix of a bipartite graph is that the graph admits a perfect matching if and only if the polynomial det(Aij) in the xij is not identically zero. Furthermore, the number of perfect matchings is equal to the number of monomials in the polynomial det(A), and is also equal to the permanent of 
 
 
 
 . In addition, rank of 
 
 
 
  is equal to the maximum matching size of 
 
 
 
 .
The Edmonds matrix is named after Jack Edmonds. The Tutte matrix is a generalisation to non-bipartite graphs.
