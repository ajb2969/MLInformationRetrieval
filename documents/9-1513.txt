   Edmonds matrix      Edmonds matrix   In graph theory , the Edmonds matrix    A   A   A   of a balanced bipartite graph     G   (  U  ,  V  ,  E  )       G   U  V  E     G(U,V,E)   with sets of vertices    U  =   {   u  1   ,   u  2   ,  …  ,   u  n   }       U    subscript  u  1    subscript  u  2   normal-…   subscript  u  n      U=\{u_{1},u_{2},\dots,u_{n}\}   and    V  =   {   v  1   ,   v  2   ,  …  ,   v  n   }       V    subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2   normal-…   subscript  v  n      V=\{v_{1},v_{2},\dots,v_{n}\}   is defined by       A   i  j    =   {      x   i  j        (   u  i   ,   v  j   )   ∈  E       0      (   u  i   ,   v  j   )   ∉  E             subscript  A    i  j     cases     subscript  x    i  j        subscript  u  i    subscript  v  j    E     0      subscript  u  i    subscript  v  j    E        A_{ij}=\left\{\begin{array}[]{ll}x_{ij}&(u_{i},v_{j})\in E\\
 0&(u_{i},v_{j})\notin E\end{array}\right.     where the x ij are indeterminates . One application of the Edmonds matrix of a bipartite graph is that the graph admits a perfect matching if and only if the polynomial det( A ij ) in the x ij is not identically zero. Furthermore, the number of perfect matchings is equal to the number of monomials in the polynomial det( A ), and is also equal to the permanent of   A   A   A   . In addition, rank of   A   A   A   is equal to the maximum matching size of   G   G   G   .  The Edmonds matrix is named after Jack Edmonds . The Tutte matrix is a generalisation to non-bipartite graphs.  References      "  Category:Algebraic graph theory
