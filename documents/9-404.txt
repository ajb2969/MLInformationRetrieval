Homogeneously Suslin set

In descriptive set theory, a set 
 
 
 
  is said to be homogeneously Suslin if it is the projection of a homogeneous tree. 
 
 
 
  is said to be 

 
 -homogeneously Suslin if it is the projection of a 
 
 
 
 -homogeneous tree.
If 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
  set and 
 
 
 
  is a measurable cardinal, then 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 -homogeneously Suslin. This result is important in the proof that the existence of a measurable cardinal implies that 
 
 
 
  sets are determined.
