   Homogeneously Suslin set      Homogeneously Suslin set   In descriptive set theory , a set   S   S   S   is said to be homogeneously Suslin if it is the projection of a homogeneous  tree .   S   S   S   is said to be    κ   κ   \kappa   -homogeneously Suslin if it is the projection of a   κ   κ   \kappa   -homogeneous tree.  If    A  ⊆   ω    ω       A   superscript  ω  ω     A\subseteq{}^{\omega}\omega   is a    𝚷  1  1     superscript   subscript  𝚷  1   1    \mathbf{\Pi}_{1}^{1}   set and   κ   κ   \kappa   is a measurable cardinal, then   A   A   A   is   κ   κ   \kappa   -homogeneously Suslin. This result is important in the proof that the existence of a measurable cardinal implies that    𝚷  1  1     superscript   subscript  𝚷  1   1    \mathbf{\Pi}_{1}^{1}   sets are determined .
