   Successor ordinal      Successor ordinal   In set theory , the successor of an ordinal number  α is the smallest ordinal number greater than α . An ordinal number that is a successor is called a successor ordinal .  Properties  Every ordinal other than 0 is either a successor ordinal or a limit ordinal . 1  In Von Neumann's model  Using von Neumann 's ordinal numbers (the standard model of the ordinals used in set theory), the successor S ( α ) of an ordinal number α is given by the formula 2        S   (  α  )    =   α  ∪   {  α  }     .        S  α     α   α      S(\alpha)=\alpha\cup\{\alpha\}.     Since the ordering on the ordinal numbers α \alpha + 0 = \alpha\!       α  +   S   (  β  )     =   S   (   α  +  β   )          α    S  β      S    α  β      \alpha+S(\beta)=S(\alpha+\beta)\!     and for a limit ordinal λ       α  +  λ   =    ⋃   β  <  λ     (   α  +  β   )          α  λ     subscript     β  λ      α  β      \alpha+\lambda=\bigcup_{\beta<\lambda}(\alpha+\beta)     In particular, S (α) = α + 1. Multiplication and exponentiation are defined similarly.  Topology  The successor points and zero are the isolated points of the class of ordinal numbers, with respect to the order topology . 3  See also   ordinal arithmetic  limit ordinal  successor cardinal   References  "  Category:Ordinal numbers     . ↩   . ↩
