Successor ordinal

In set theory, the successor of an ordinal number α is the smallest ordinal number greater than α. An ordinal number that is a successor is called a successor ordinal.
Properties
Every ordinal other than 0 is either a successor ordinal or a limit ordinal.1
In Von Neumann's model
Using von Neumann's ordinal numbers (the standard model of the ordinals used in set theory), the successor S(α) of an ordinal number α is given by the formula2



Since the ordering on the ordinal numbers α \alpha + 0 = \alpha\!



and for a limit ordinal λ



In particular, S(α) = α + 1. Multiplication and exponentiation are defined similarly.
Topology
The successor points and zero are the isolated points of the class of ordinal numbers, with respect to the order topology.3
