   Hermite–Minkowski theorem      Hermite–Minkowski theorem   In mathematics, especially in algebraic number theory , the Hermite–Minkowski theorem states that for any integer N there are only finitely many number fields , i.e., finite field extensions  K of the rational numbers Q , such that the discriminant of K / Q is at most N . The theorem is named after Charles Hermite and Hermann Minkowski .  This theorem is a consequence of the estimate for the discriminant        |   d  K   |    ≥     n  n    n  !      (   π  4   )    n  /  2              subscript  d  K          superscript  n  n     n     superscript    π  4     n  2       \sqrt{|d_{K}|}\geq\frac{n^{n}}{n!}\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)^{n/2}     where n is the degree of the field extension, together with Stirling's formula for n !. This inequality also shows that the discriminant of any number field strictly bigger than Q is not ±1, which in turn implies that Q has no unramified extensions.
