   Alpha Caeli      Alpha Caeli   Alpha Caeli (α Cae, α Caeli) is a double star system in the constellation  Caelum .  Alpha Caeli A is an F-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of F2V and an apparent magnitude of +4.44. It has 1.48 times the mass of the Sun 1 and 1.3 times the solar radius . 2 The projected rotational velocity at the stellar equator is 47.8 km/s. 3 It is suspected of being a Delta Scuti variable star. 4  The companion is a spectral class M0.5V red dwarf star with absolute magnitude 9.80. 5 It is a UV Ceti variable star that undergoes random increases in luminosity. 6 This star is currently separated from the primary by an angle of 6.6 arcseconds , which indicates an orbit with a semimajor axis whose expected value is 206 AU . 7  Alpha Caeli is approximately 65.7 light years from Earth and is an estimated 900 million years old. The space velocity components of this system are U = 10, V = 6 and W = -10 km/s. It is orbiting the Milky Way galaxy at an average distance of 8.006 kpc from the core and with an orbital eccentricity of 0.07. This orbit lies close to the galactic plane, and the system travels no more than 0.05 kpc above or below this plane. 8 Alpha Caeli is probably a member of the Ursa Major moving group of stars that have similar kinematic properties and probably originated from the same star cluster . 9  References  "  Caeli, Alpha  Category:Caelum (constellation)  Category:F-type main-sequence stars  029875  021770  CD-42 01587  Category:Binary stars      ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  See the [ http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/VizieR-5?-out.add =.&-source=V/117A/newcat&recno;=3027 entry for HIP 21770] in the VizieR table with CDS ID V/117A . ↩  ↩
