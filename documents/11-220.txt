Long-chain-enoyl-CoA hydratase

In enzymology, a long-chain-enoyl-CoA hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(3S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA 
 
 
 
  trans-2-enoyl-CoA + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (3S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, and two products, trans-2-enoyl-CoA and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is long-chain-(3S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA hydro-lyase. This enzyme is also called long-chain enoyl coenzyme A hydratase. This enzyme participates in fatty acid elongation in mitochondria and fatty acid metabolism.
