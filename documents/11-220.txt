   Long-chain-enoyl-CoA hydratase      Long-chain-enoyl-CoA hydratase   In enzymology , a long-chain-enoyl-CoA hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (3S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   trans-2-enoyl-CoA + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (3S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA , and two products , trans-2-enoyl-CoA and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is long-chain-(3S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA hydro-lyase . This enzyme is also called long-chain enoyl coenzyme A hydratase . This enzyme participates in fatty acid elongation in mitochondria and fatty acid metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 4.2.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
