   Hereditarily countable set      Hereditarily countable set   In set theory , a set is called hereditarily countable if it is a countable set of hereditarily countable sets. This inductive definition is in fact well-founded and can be expressed in the language of first-order set theory. A set is hereditarily countable if and only if it is countable, and every element of its transitive closure is countable. If the axiom of countable choice holds, then a set is hereditarily countable if and only if its transitive closure is countable.  The class of all hereditarily countable sets can be proven to be a set from the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) without any form of the axiom of choice , and this set is designated    H   ℵ  1      subscript  H   subscript  normal-ℵ  1     H_{\aleph_{1}}   . The hereditarily countable sets form a model of Kripke–Platek set theory with the axiom of infinity (KPI), if the axiom of countable choice is assumed in the metatheory .  If    x  ∈   H   ℵ  1        x   subscript  H   subscript  normal-ℵ  1      x\in H_{\aleph_{1}}   , then      L   ω  1     (  x  )    ⊂   H   ℵ  1           subscript  L   subscript  ω  1    x    subscript  H   subscript  normal-ℵ  1      L_{\omega_{1}}(x)\subset H_{\aleph_{1}}   .  More generally, a set is hereditarily of cardinality less than κ if and only if it is of cardinality less than κ, and all its elements are hereditarily of cardinality less than κ; the class of all such sets can also be proven to be a set from the axioms of ZF, and is designated     H  κ      subscript  H  κ    H_{\kappa}\!   . If the axiom of choice holds and the cardinal κ is regular, then a set is hereditarily of cardinality less than κ if and only if its transitive closure is of cardinality less than κ.
