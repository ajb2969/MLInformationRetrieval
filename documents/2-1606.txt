   Catenoid      Catenoid   (Figure)  A catenoid   A catenoid is a surface in 3-dimensional Euclidean space arising by rotating a catenary  curve about its directrix . Not counting the plane, it is the first minimal surface to be discovered. It was found and proved to be minimal by Leonhard Euler in 1744. 1  Early work on the subject was published also by Jean Baptiste Meusnier . 2 There are only two minimal surfaces of revolution ( surfaces of revolution which are also minimal surfaces): the plane and the catenoid. 3  The catenoid may be defined by the following parametric equations:      x  =   c   cosh   v  c     cos  u        x    c      v  c      u      x=c\cosh\frac{v}{c}\cos u         y  =   c   cosh   v  c     sin  u        y    c      v  c      u      y=c\cosh\frac{v}{c}\sin u         z  =  v      z  v    z=v      where u and v are real parameters and c is a non-zero real constant.   In cylindrical coordinates:      ρ  =   c   cosh   z  c         ρ    c      z  c       \rho=c\cosh\frac{z}{c}      Where c is a real constant.   A physical model of a catenoid can be formed by dipping two circles into a soap solution and slowly drawing the circles apart.  The catenoid may be also defined approximately by the Stretched grid method as a facet 3D model  Helicoid transformation  (Figure)  Animation showing the deformation of a helicoid into a catenoid.   Because they are members of the same associate family of surfaces, one can bend a catenoid into a portion of a helicoid without stretching. In other words, one can make a (mostly) continuous and isometric deformation of a catenoid to a portion of the helicoid such that every member of the deformation family is minimal (having a mean curvature of zero). A parametrization of such a deformation is given by the system       x   (  u  ,  v  )    =     cos   θ     sinh   v     sin  u    +    sin   θ     cosh   v     cos  u           x   u  v          θ     v     u        θ     v     u       x(u,v)=\cos\theta\,\sinh v\,\sin u+\sin\theta\,\cosh v\,\cos u          y   (  u  ,  v  )    =    -    cos   θ     sinh   v     cos  u     +    sin   θ     cosh   v     sin  u           y   u  v            θ     v     u         θ     v     u       y(u,v)=-\cos\theta\,\sinh v\,\cos u+\sin\theta\,\cosh v\,\sin u          z   (  u  ,  v  )    =    u   cos  θ    +   v   sin   θ            z   u  v        u    θ      v    θ       z(u,v)=u\cos\theta+v\sin\theta\,      for     (  u  ,  v  )   ∈    (   -  π   ,  π  ]   ×   (   -  ∞   ,  ∞  )         u  v        π   π             (u,v)\in(-\pi,\pi]\times(-\infty,\infty)   , with deformation parameter     -  π   <  θ  ≤  π          π   θ       π     -\pi<\theta\leq\pi   ,   where    θ  =  π      θ  π    \theta=\pi   corresponds to a right-handed helicoid,    θ  =   ±   π  /  2        θ   plus-or-minus    π  2      \theta=\pm\pi/2   corresponds to a catenoid, and    θ  =  0      θ  0    \theta=0   corresponds to a left-handed helicoid.  Architecture  The Inuit learned to develop their igloo structures by implementing a catenoid shape which offers optimal balanace between height and diameter of the structure without risk of collapsing under the weight of compacted snow. 4   References  External links    Catenoid - WebGL model   de:Minimalfläche#Die Katenoiden "  Category:Geometry  Category:Minimal surfaces     ↩  ↩  Catenoid at MathWorld ↩  ↩
