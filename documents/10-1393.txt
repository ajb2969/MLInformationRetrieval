Hydrogen:quinone oxidoreductase




Hydrogen:quinone oxidoreductase

In enzymology, a hydrogen:quinone oxidoreductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

H2 + menaquinone 
 
 
 
  menaquinol
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are H2 and menaquinone, whereas its product is menaquinol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on hydrogen as donor with a quinone or similar compound as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hydrogen:quinone oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include hydrogen-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, hydrogen:menaquinone oxidoreductase, membrane-bound hydrogenase, and quinone-reactive Ni/Fe-hydrogenase.
