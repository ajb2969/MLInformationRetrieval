   Hydrogen:quinone oxidoreductase      Hydrogen:quinone oxidoreductase   In enzymology , a hydrogen:quinone oxidoreductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   H 2 + menaquinone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   menaquinol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are H 2 and menaquinone , whereas its product is menaquinol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on hydrogen as donor with a quinone or similar compound as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hydrogen:quinone oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include hydrogen-ubiquinone oxidoreductase , hydrogen:menaquinone oxidoreductase , membrane-bound hydrogenase , and quinone-reactive Ni/Fe-hydrogenase .
