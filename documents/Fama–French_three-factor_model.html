<h1>Fama–French three-factor model</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a href="asset_pricing" title="wikilink">asset pricing</a> and <a href="Investment_management" title="wikilink">portfolio management</a> the <strong>Fama–French three-factor model</strong> is a model designed by <a href="Eugene_Fama" title="wikilink">Eugene Fama</a> and <a href="Kenneth_French" title="wikilink">Kenneth French</a> to describe stock returns. Fama and French were professors at the <a href="University_of_Chicago_Booth_School_of_Business" title="wikilink">University of Chicago Booth School of Business</a>, where Fama still resides.</p>
<p>The traditional asset pricing model, known formally as the <a href="capital_asset_pricing_model" title="wikilink">capital asset pricing model</a> (CAPM) uses only one variable to describe the returns of a <a href="Portfolio_(finance)" title="wikilink">portfolio</a> or stock with the returns of the market as a whole. In contrast, the Fama–French model uses three variables. Fama and French started with the observation that two classes of <a href="stock" title="wikilink">stocks</a> have tended to do better than the market as a whole: (i) <a href="Market_capitalization" title="wikilink">small caps</a> and (ii) stocks with a low <a href="P/B_ratio" title="wikilink">Price-to-Book ratio</a> (P/B, customarily called <a href="value_stocks" title="wikilink">value stocks</a>, contrasted with <a href="growth_stock" title="wikilink">growth stocks</a>). They then added two factors to <a href="Capital_asset_pricing_model" title="wikilink">CAPM</a> to reflect a portfolio's exposure to these two classes:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$r=R_f+\beta_3(K_m-R_f)+b_s\cdot\mathit{SMB}+b_v\cdot\mathit{HML}+\alpha$$</span></p>
<p>Here r is the portfolio's expected rate of return, <em>R</em><sub><em>f</em></sub> is the risk-free return rate, and <em>K</em><sub><em>m</em></sub> is the return of the market portfolio. The "three factor" <em>β</em> is analogous to the classical <em>β</em> but not equal to it, since there are now two additional factors to do some of the work. <em>SMB</em> stands for "<strong>S</strong>mall [market capitalization] <strong>M</strong>inus <strong>B</strong>ig" and <em>HML</em> for "<strong>H</strong>igh [book-to-market ratio] <strong>M</strong>inus <strong>L</strong>ow"; they measure the historic excess returns of small caps over big caps and of value stocks over growth stocks. These factors are calculated with combinations of portfolios composed by ranked stocks (BtM ranking, Cap ranking) and available historical market data. Historical values may be accessed on <a href="http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html">Kenneth French's web page</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, once SMB and HML are defined, the corresponding coefficients <em>b</em><sub><em>s</em></sub> and <em>b</em><sub><em>v</em></sub> are determined by linear regressions and can take negative values as well as positive values. The Fama–French three-factor model explains over 90% of the diversified portfolios returns, compared with the average 70% given by the CAPM (within sample). They find positive returns from small size as well as value factors, high book-to-market ratio and related ratios. Examining β and size, they find that higher returns, small size, and higher β are all correlated. They then test returns for β, controlling for size, and find no relationship. Assuming stocks are first partitioned by size the predictive power of β then disappears. They discuss whether β can saved and the Sharpe-Lintner-Black model resuscitated by mistakes in their analysis, and find it unlikely.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Griffin shows that the Fama and French factors are country specific and concludes that the local factors provide a better explanation of time-series variation in stock returns than the global factors.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Therefore, updated risk factors are available for other stock markets in the world, including the <a href="http://xfi.exeter.ac.uk/researchandpublications/portfoliosandfactors/disclaimer.php">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="http://www.fm.wi.tum.de/index.php?id=21">Germany</a> and <a href="http://www.ammannsteiner.ch/">Switzerland</a>. <a href="Eugene_Fama" title="wikilink">Eugene Fama</a> and <a href="Kenneth_French" title="wikilink">Kenneth French</a> recently analysed models with local and global risk factors for four regions (North America, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific) and conclude that local factors work better than global factors for regional portfolios.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The global and local risk factors may also be accessed on <a href="http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html">Kenneth French's web page</a>.</p>
<p>A number of studies have reported that when the Fama–French model is applied to emerging markets the book-to-market factor retains its explanatory ability but the market value of equity factor performs poorly. In a recent paper, Foye, Mramor and Pahor (2013) propose an alternative three factor model that replaces the market value of equity component with a term that acts as a proxy for accounting manipulation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
