Fano's inequality

In information theory, Fano's inequality (also known as the Fano converse and the Fano lemma) relates the average information lost in a noisy channel to the probability of the categorization error. It was derived by Robert Fano in the early 1950s while teaching a Ph.D. seminar in information theory at MIT, and later recorded in his 1961 textbook.
It is used to find a lower bound on the error probability of any decoder as well as the lower bounds for minimax risks in density estimation.
Let the random variables X and Y represent input and output messages with a joint probability

 
 . Let e represent an occurrence of error; i.e., that 
 
 
 
 , being 
 
 
 
  a noise approximate version of 
 
 
 
 . Fano's inequality is



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the support of X,



is the conditional entropy,



is the probability of the communication error, and



is the corresponding binary entropy.
Alternative formulation
Let X be a random variable with density equal to one of 
 
 
 
  possible densities 
 
 
 
 . Furthermore, the Kullback–Leibler divergence between any pair of densities cannot be too large,


 
  for all 
 
 

Let 
 
 
 
  be an estimate of the index. Then


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the probability induced by 
 
 

Generalization
The following generalization is due to Ibragimov and Khasminskii (1979), Assouad and Birge (1983).
Let F be a class of densities with a subclass of r + 1 densities ƒθ such that for any θ ≠ θ′






Then in the worst case the expected value of error of estimation is bound from below,



where ƒn is any density estimator based on a sample of size n.
