   Chézy formula      Chézy formula   In fluid dynamics , the Chézy formula describes the mean flow velocity of steady , turbulent  open channel flow :       v  =   C     R   i      ,      v    C      R  i       v=C\sqrt{R\,i},\,     where      v   v   v   is the mean velocity [m/s],     C   C   C   is the Chézy coefficient [m ½ /s],     R   R   R   is the hydraulic radius (~ water depth) [m], and     i   i   i   is the bottom slope [m/m].   The formula is named after Antoine de Chézy , the French hydraulics engineer who devised it in 1775.  Usage with Manning coefficient  This formula can also be used with Manning's Roughness Coefficient, instead of Chézy's coefficient. Manning derived 1 the following relation to C based upon experiments:      C  =    1  n    R   1  /  6         C      1  n    superscript  R    1  6       C=\frac{1}{n}R^{1/6}     where      C   C   C   is the Chézy coefficient [m ½ /s],     R   R   R   is the hydraulic radius (~ water depth) [m], and     n   n   n   is Manning's roughness coefficient.   Unlike the Manning equation, which is empirical, the Chézy equation is derived from hydrodynamics theory. 2  See also   Hydraulics  Manning formula   References    External links   History of the Chézy Formula   he:משוואת מנינג#הרדיוס ההידראולי "  Category:Fluid dynamics  Category:Hydrology  Category:Piping  Category:Hydraulic engineering     Manning, R., "On the flow of Water in Open Channels and Pipes."
