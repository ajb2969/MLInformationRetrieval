Chézy formula

In fluid dynamics, the Chézy formula describes the mean flow velocity of steady, turbulent open channel flow:



where



 
  is the mean velocity [m/s],


 
  is the Chézy coefficient [m½/s],


 
 
  is the hydraulic radius (~ water depth) [m], and


 
  is the bottom slope [m/m].

The formula is named after Antoine de Chézy, the French hydraulics engineer who devised it in 1775.
Usage with Manning coefficient
This formula can also be used with Manning's Roughness Coefficient, instead of Chézy's coefficient. Manning derived1 the following relation to C based upon experiments:



where



 
  is the Chézy coefficient [m½/s],


 
  is the hydraulic radius (~ water depth) [m], and


 
 
  is Manning's roughness coefficient.

Unlike the Manning equation, which is empirical, the Chézy equation is derived from hydrodynamics theory.2
