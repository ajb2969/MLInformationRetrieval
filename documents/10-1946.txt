   Arylmalonate decarboxylase      Arylmalonate decarboxylase   In enzymology , an arylmalonate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-aryl-2-methylmalonate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-arylpropanoate + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-aryl-2-methylmalonate , and two products , 2-arylpropanoate and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-aryl-2-methylmalonate carboxy-lyase (2-arylpropanoate-forming) . Other names in common use include AMDASE , 2-aryl-2-methylmalonate carboxy-lyase , and 2-aryl-2-methylmalonate carboxy-lyase (2-arylpropionate-forming) .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
