   Canonical singularity      Canonical singularity   In mathematics, canonical singularities appear as singularities of the canonical model of a projective variety , and terminal singularities are special cases that appear as singularities of minimal models . They were introduced by . Terminal singularities are important in the minimal model program because smooth minimal models do not always exist, and thus one must allow certain singularities, namely the terminal singularities.  Definition  Suppose that Y is a normal variety such that its canonical class K Y is Q -Cartier, and let f : X → Y be a resolution of the singularities of Y . Then       K  X   =     f  *    (   K  Y   )    +    ∑  i     a  i    E  i           subscript  K  X        superscript  f     subscript  K  Y      subscript   i      subscript  a  i    subscript  E  i        \displaystyle K_{X}=f^{*}(K_{Y})+\sum_{i}a_{i}E_{i}   where the sum is over the irreducible exceptional divisors, and the a i are rational numbers, called the discrepancies.  Then the singularities of Y are called:   terminal if a i > 0 for all i   canonical if a i ≥ 0 for all i   log terminal if a i > −1 for all i   log canonical if a i ≥ −1 for all i .

Properties  The singularities of a projective variety V are canonical if the variety is normal , some power of the canonical line bundle of the non-singular part of V extends to a line bundle on V , and V has the same plurigenera as any resolution of its singularities. V has canonical singularities if and only if it is a relative canonical model .  The singularities of a projective variety V are terminal if the variety is normal , some power of the canonical line bundle of the non-singular part of V extends to a line bundle on V , and V the pullback of any section of V m vanishes along any codimension 1 component of the exceptional locus of a resolution of its singularities.  Classification in small dimensions  Two dimensional terminal singularities are smooth. If a variety has terminal singularities, then its singular points have codimension at least 3, and in particular in dimensions 1 and 2 all terminal singularities are smooth. In 3 dimensions they are isolated and were classified by .  Two dimensional canonical singularities are the same as du Val singularities , and are analytically isomorphic to quotients of C 2 by finite subgroups of SL 2 ( C ).  Two dimensional log terminal singularities are analytically isomorphic to quotients of C 2 by finite subgroups of GL 2 ( C ).  Two dimensional log canonical singularities have been classified by .  Pairs  More generally one can define these concepts for a pair    (  X  ,  Δ  )     X  normal-Δ    (X,\Delta)   where   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   is a formal linear combination of prime divisors with rational coefficients such that     K  X   +  Δ       subscript  K  X   normal-Δ    K_{X}+\Delta   is   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   -Cartier. The pair is called   terminal if Discrep     (  X  ,  Δ  )   >  0       X  normal-Δ   0    (X,\Delta)>0     canonical if Discrep     (  X  ,  Δ  )   ≥  0       X  normal-Δ   0    (X,\Delta)\geq 0     klt (Kawamata log terminal) if Discrep     (  X  ,  Δ  )   >   -  1        X  normal-Δ     1     (X,\Delta)>-1   and     ⌊  Δ  ⌋   ≤  0        normal-Δ   0    \lfloor\Delta\rfloor\leq 0     plt (purely log terminal) if Discrep     (  X  ,  Δ  )   >   -  1        X  normal-Δ     1     (X,\Delta)>-1     lc (log canonical) if Discrep     (  X  ,  Δ  )   ≥   -  1        X  normal-Δ     1     (X,\Delta)\geq-1   .
