   Quasi-compact morphism      Quasi-compact morphism   In algebraic geometry , a morphism    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   between schemes is said to be quasi-compact if Y can be covered by open affine subschemes    V  i     subscript  V  i    V_{i}   such that the pre-images     f   -  1     (   V  i   )        superscript  f    1     subscript  V  i     f^{-1}(V_{i})   are quasi-compact (as topological space). 1 If f is quasi-compact, then the pre-image of a quasi-compact open subscheme (e.g., open affine subscheme) under f is quasi-compact.  It is not enough that Y admits a covering by quasi-compact open subschemes whose pre-images are quasi-compact. To give an example, 2 let A be a ring that does not satisfy the ascending chain conditions on radical ideals, and put    X  =   Spec  A       X   Spec  A     X=\operatorname{Spec}A   . X contains an open subset U that is not quasi-compact. Let Y be the scheme obtained by gluing two X 's along U . X , Y are both quasi-compact. If    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   is the inclusion of one of the copies of X , then the pre-image of the other X , open affine in Y , is U , not quasi-compact. Hence, f is not quasi-compact.  A morphism from a quasi-compact scheme to an affine scheme is quasi-compact.  Let    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   be a quasi-compact morphism between schemes. Then    f   (  X  )       f  X    f(X)   is closed if and only if it is stable under specialization.  The composition of quasi-compact morphisms is quasi-compact. The base change of a quasi-compact morphism is quasi-compact.  An affine scheme is quasi-compact. In fact, a scheme is quasi-compact if and only if it is a finite union of open affine subschemes. Serre’s criterion gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a quasi-compact scheme to be affine.  A quasi-compact scheme has at least one closed point. 3  See also   fpqc morphism   External links   http://mathoverflow.net/questions/34620/when-is-an-irreducible-scheme-quasi-compact   References   Hartshorne, Algebraic Geometry .
