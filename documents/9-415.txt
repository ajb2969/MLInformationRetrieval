Young–Laplace equation




Young–Laplace equation

In physics, the Young–Laplace equation () is a nonlinear partial differential equation that describes the capillary pressure difference sustained across the interface between two static fluids, such as water and air, due to the phenomenon of surface tension or wall tension, although usage on the latter is only applicable if assuming that the wall is very thin. The Young–Laplace equation relates the pressure difference to the shape of the surface or wall and it is fundamentally important in the study of static capillary surfaces. It is a statement of normal stress balance for static fluids meeting at an interface, where the interface is treated as a surface (zero thickness):



where 
 
 
 
  is the pressure difference across the fluid interface, γ is the surface tension (or wall tension), 
 
 
 
  is the unit normal pointing out of the surface, 
 
 
 
  is the mean curvature, and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the principal radii of curvature. (Some authors refer inappropriately to the factor 
 
 
 
  as the total curvature.) Note that only normal stress is considered, this is because it can be shown1 that a static interface is possible only in the absence of tangential stress.
The equation is named after Thomas Young, who developed the qualitative theory of surface tension in 1805, and Pierre-Simon Laplace who completed the mathematical description in the following year. It is sometimes also called the Young–Laplace–Gauss equation, as Gauss unified the work of Young and Laplace in 1830, deriving both the differential equation and boundary conditions using Johann Bernoulli's virtual work principles.2
Soap films
If the pressure difference is zero, as in a soap film without gravity, the interface will assume the shape of a minimal surface.
Note that this is not valid for a soap bubble, because its inner volume is enclosed and has a different pressure from the outside.
Emulsions
The equation also explains the energy required to create an emulsion. To form the small, highly curved droplets of an emulsion, extra energy is required to overcome the large pressure that results from their small radius.
Capillary pressure in a tube

Spherical meniscus with wetting angle less than 90°




In a sufficiently narrow (i.e., low Bond number) tube of circular cross-section (radius a), the interface between two fluids forms a meniscus that is a portion of the surface of a sphere with radius R. The pressure jump across this surface is:



This may be shown by writing the Young–Laplace equation in spherical form with a contact angle boundary condition and also a prescribed height boundary condition at, say, the bottom of the meniscus. The solution is a portion of a sphere, and the solution will exist only for the pressure difference shown above. This is significant because there isn't another equation or law to specify the pressure difference; existence of solution for one specific value of the pressure difference prescribes it.
The radius of the sphere will be a function only of the contact angle, θ, which in turn depends on the exact properties of the fluids and the solids in which they are in contact:



so that the pressure difference may be written as:

In order to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium, the induced capillary pressure is balanced by a change in height, h, which can be positive or negative, depending on whether the wetting angle is less than or greater than 90°. For a fluid of density ρ:



— where g is the gravitational acceleration. This is sometimes known as the Jurin rule or Jurin height3 after James Jurin who studied the effect in 1718.See:

James Jurin (1718) [http://books.google.com/books?id=NUVFAAAAcAAJ&pg;;=PA739#v=onepage&q;&f;=false "An account of some experiments shown before the Royal Society; with an enquiry into the cause of some of the ascent and suspension of water in capillary tubes,"] Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 30 : 739–747.
James Jurin (1719) [http://books.google.com/books?id=NUVFAAAAcAAJ&pg;;=PA1083#v=onepage&q;&f;=false "An account of some new experiments, relating to the action of glass tubes upon water and quicksilver,"] Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 30 : 1083–1096.

For a water-filled glass tube in air at sea level:




γ = 0.0728 J/m2 at 20 °C

θ = 20° (0.35 rad)



ρ = 1000 kg/m3

g = 9.8 m/s2



— and so the height of the water column is given by:


m. Thus for a 2 mm wide (1 mm radius) tube, the water would rise 14 mm. However, for a capillary tube with radius 0.1 mm, the water would rise 14 cm (about 6 inches).
Capillary action in general
In the general case, for a free surface and where there is an applied "over-pressure", Δp, at the interface in equilibrium, there is a balance between the applied pressure, the hydrostatic pressure and the effects of surface tension. The Young–Laplace equation becomes:



The equation can be non-dimensionalised in terms of its characteristic length-scale, the capillary length:



— and characteristic pressure:



For clean water at standard temperature and pressure, the capillary length is ~2 mm.
The non-dimensional equation then becomes:



Thus, the surface shape is determined by only one parameter, the over pressure of the fluid, Δp* and the scale of the surface is given by the capillary length. The solution of the equation requires an initial condition for position, and the gradient of the surface at the start point.

A liquid bridge is produced for an over pressure of Δp*=3.5 and initial condition r0=0.25−4, z0=0, dz/dr=0




Axisymmetric equations
The (nondimensional) shape, r(z) of an axisymmetric surface can be found by substituting general expressions for curvature to give the hydrostatic Young–Laplace equations:4






Application in medicine
In medicine it is often referred to as the Law of Laplace, used in the context of cardiovascular physiology, and also respiratory physiology5
History
Francis Hauksbee performed some of the earliest observations and experiments in 1709See:

Francis Hauksbee, Physico-mechanical Experiments on Various Subjects … (London, England: (Self-published by author; printed by R. Brugis), 1709), pages 139–169.
Francis Hauksbee (1711) "An account of an experiment touching the direction of a drop of oil of oranges, between two glass planes, towards any side of them that is nearest press'd together," Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 27 : 374–375.
Francis Hauksbee (1712) "An account of an experiment touching the ascent of water between two glass planes, in an hyperbolick figure," Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 27 : 539–540. and these were repeated in 1718 by James Jurin who observed that the height of fluid in a capillary column was a function only of the cross-sectional area at the surface, not of any other dimensions of the column.67

Thomas Young laid the foundations of the equation in his 1804 paper An Essay on the Cohesion of Fluids8 where he set out in descriptive terms the principles governing contact between fluids (along with many other aspects of fluid behaviour). Pierre Simon Laplace followed this up in Mécanique Céleste9 with the formal mathematical description given above, which reproduced in symbolic terms the relationship described earlier by Young.
Laplace accepted the idea propounded by Hauksbee in his book Physico-mechanical Experiments (1709), that the phenomenon was due to a force of attraction that was insensible at sensible distances.1011 The part which deals with the action of a solid on a liquid and the mutual action of two liquids was not worked out thoroughly, but ultimately was completed by Gauss.12 Franz Ernst Neumann (1798-1895) later filled in a few details.131415
