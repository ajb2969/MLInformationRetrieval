   23S rRNA (adenosine1067-2'-O)-methyltransferase      23S rRNA (adenosine1067-2'-O)-methyltransferase   23S rRNA (adenosine 1067 -2'-O)-methyltransferase (, 23S rRNA A1067 2'-methyltransferase , thiostrepton-resistance methylase , nosiheptide -resistance methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (adenosine 1067 -2'-O)-methyltransferase . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenosine 1067 in 23S rRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methyladenosine 1067 in 23S rRNA   The methylase that is responsible for autoimmunity in the thiostrepton producer Streptomyces azureus .
