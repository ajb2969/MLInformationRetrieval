23S rRNA (adenosine1067-2'-O)-methyltransferase

23S rRNA (adenosine1067-2'-O)-methyltransferase (, 23S rRNA A1067 2'-methyltransferase, thiostrepton-resistance methylase, nosiheptide-resistance methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (adenosine1067-2'-O)-methyltransferase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenosine1067 in 23S rRNA 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methyladenosine1067 in 23S rRNA
 

The methylase that is responsible for autoimmunity in the thiostrepton producer Streptomyces azureus.
