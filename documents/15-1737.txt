   Azimi Q models      Azimi Q models   The Azimi Q models used Mathematical Q models to explain how the earth responds to seismic waves . Because these models satisfies the Krämers-Krönig relations they should be preferable to the Kolsky model in seismic inverse Q filtering .  Azimi's first model  Azimi's first model 1 (1968), which he proposed together with 2 Strick (1967) has the attenuation proportional to |w| 1-γ| and is:       α   (  w  )    =     a  1     |  w  |    1  -  γ      (  1.1  )          α  w       subscript  a  1    superscript    w     1  γ     1.1     \alpha(w)=a_{1}|w|^{1-\gamma}\quad(1.1)     The phase velocity is written:       1   c   (  w  )     =     1   c  ∞    +    a  1     |  w  |    -  γ     +   c  o  t   (    π  γ   2   )      (  1.2  )          1    c  w         1   subscript  c        subscript  a  1    superscript    w     γ       c  o  t      π  γ   2     1.2     \frac{1}{c(w)}=\frac{1}{c_{\infty}}+a_{1}|w|^{-\gamma}+cot(\frac{\pi\gamma}{2}%
 )\quad(1.2)     Azimi's second model  Azimi's second model is defined by:       α   (  w  )    =      a  2    |  w  |     1  +    a  3    |  w  |       (  2.1  )          α  w         subscript  a  2     w      1     subscript  a  3     w      2.1     \alpha(w)=\frac{a_{2}|w|}{1+a_{3}|w|}\quad(2.1)     where a 2 and a 3 are constants. Now we can use the Krämers-Krönig dispersion relation and get a phase velocity:       1   c   (  w  )     =     1   c  ∞    -    2   a  2   l  n   (    a  3   w   )     π   (   1  -    a  3  2    w  2     )       (  1.2  )          1    c  w         1   subscript  c         2   subscript  a  2   l  n     subscript  a  3   w      π    1     superscript   subscript  a  3   2    superscript  w  2        1.2     \frac{1}{c(w)}=\frac{1}{c_{\infty}}-\frac{2a_{2}ln(a_{3}w)}{\pi(1-a_{3}^{2}w^{%
