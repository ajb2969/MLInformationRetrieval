Perfect thermal contact




Perfect thermal contact

Perfect thermal contact of the surface of a solid with the environment (convective heat transfer) or another solid occurs when the temperatures of the mating surfaces are equal.
Perfect thermal contact conditions
Perfect thermal contact supposes that on the boundary surface 
 
 
 
  there holds an equality of the temperatures



and an equality of heat fluxes



where 
 
 
 
 
  are temperatures of the solid and environment (or mating solid), respectively; 
 
 
 
  are thermal conductivity coefficients of the solid and mating laminar layer (or solid), respectively; 
 
 
 
  is normal to the surface 
 
 
 
 .
If there is a heat source on the boundary surface 
 
 
 
 , e.g. caused by sliding friction, the latter equality transforms in the following manner



where 
 
 
 
  is heat-generation rate per unit area.
