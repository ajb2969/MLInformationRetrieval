   Perfect thermal contact      Perfect thermal contact   Perfect thermal contact of the surface of a solid with the environment ( convective heat transfer ) or another solid occurs when the temperatures of the mating surfaces are equal.  Perfect thermal contact conditions  Perfect thermal contact supposes that on the boundary surface   A   A   A   there holds an equality of the temperatures      T  |  =   T  e     |  A       fragments  T  normal-|    subscript  T  e    subscript  normal-|  A     T\big|=T_{e}\big|_{A}\,     and an equality of heat fluxes       -     k    ∂  T    ∂  n     |   A    =   -      k  e     ∂   T  e     ∂  n     |   A           evaluated-at    k      T     n     A       evaluated-at     subscript  k  e        subscript  T  e      n     A      -k\frac{\partial T}{\partial n}\bigg|_{A}=-k_{e}\frac{\partial T_{e}}{\partial

 }\bigg|_{A}\,     where    T  ,   T  e      T   subscript  T  e     T,~{}T_{e}   are temperatures of the solid and environment (or mating solid), respectively;    k  ,   k  e      k   subscript  k  e     k,~{}k_{e}   are thermal conductivity coefficients of the solid and mating laminar layer (or solid), respectively;   n   n   n   is normal to the surface   A   A   A   .  If there is a heat source on the boundary surface   A   A   A   , e.g. caused by sliding friction , the latter equality transforms in the following manner        -     k    ∂  T    ∂  n     |   A    +      k  e     ∂   T  e     ∂  n     |   A    =   q            evaluated-at    k      T     n     A     evaluated-at     subscript  k  e        subscript  T  e      n     A    q    -k\frac{\partial T}{\partial n}\bigg|_{A}+k_{e}\frac{\partial T_{e}}{\partial n%
