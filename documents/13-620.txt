   Sverdrup wave      Sverdrup wave   A Sverdrup wave is a wave in the ocean (especially infinite open ocean), which is affected by gravity and Earth's rotation (see Coriolis effect )  In shallow water gravity wave [or long wave ()], (h stands for depth)only gravity effect the wave, the phase velocity of shallow water gravity wave ( c ) can be noted as      c  =    (   g  h   )    1  /  2        c   superscript    g  h     1  2      c=(gh)^{1/2}     and the group velocity ( c g ) of shallow water gravity wave can be noted as       c  g   =    (   g  h   )    1  /  2         subscript  c  normal-g    superscript    g  h     1  2      c_{\mathrm{g}}=(gh)^{1/2}   i.e.    c  =   c  g       c   subscript  c  normal-g     c=c_{\mathrm{g}}     where g is gravity, Î» is the wavelength and h is the total depth. But after concerning the inertial acceleration, the result would be different.  See also   Sverdrup  Harald Sverdrup   "  Category:Waves
