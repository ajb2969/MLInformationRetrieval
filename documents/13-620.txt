Sverdrup wave

A Sverdrup wave is a wave in the ocean (especially infinite open ocean), which is affected by gravity and Earth's rotation (see Coriolis effect)
In shallow water gravity wave [or long wave ()], (h stands for depth)only gravity effect the wave, the phase velocity of shallow water gravity wave (c) can be noted as



and the group velocity (cg) of shallow water gravity wave can be noted as


 
  i.e. 
 
 

where g is gravity, Î» is the wavelength and h is the total depth. But after concerning the inertial acceleration, the result would be different.
