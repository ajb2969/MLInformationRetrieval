   7,8-dihydroxykynurenate 8,8a-dioxygenase      7,8-dihydroxykynurenate 8,8a-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a 7,8-dihydroxykynurenate 8,8a-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   7,8-dihydroxykynurenate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-(3-carboxy-3-oxopropenyl)-4,6-dihydroxypyridine-2-carboxylate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 7,8-dihydroxykynurenate and O 2 , whereas its product is 5-(3-carboxy-3-oxopropenyl)-4,6-dihydroxypyridine-2-carboxylate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 7,8-dihydroxykynurenate:oxygen 8,8a-oxidoreductase (decyclizing) . Other names in common use include 7,8-dihydroxykynurenate oxygenase , and 7,8-dihydroxykynurenate 8,8alpha-dioxygenase . This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism . It employs one cofactor , iron .  References     "  Category:EC 1.13.11  Category:Iron enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
