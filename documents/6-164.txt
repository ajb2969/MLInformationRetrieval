   Hypsochromic shift      Hypsochromic shift   Hypsochromic shift is a change of spectral band position in the absorption , reflectance , transmittance , or emission spectrum of a molecule to a shorter wavelength (higher frequency ). Because the blue color in the visible spectrum has a shorter wavelength than most other colors, this effect is also commonly called a blue shift .  This can occur because of a change in environmental conditions: for example, a change in solvent polarity will result in solvatochromism . A series of structurally related molecules in a substitution series can also show a hypsochromic shift. Hypsochromic shift is a phenomenon seen in molecular spectra, not atomic spectra - it is thus more common to speak of the movement of the peaks in the spectrum rather than lines.
