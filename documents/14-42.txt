   Cohen's cryptosystem      Cohen's cryptosystem   Cohen's cryptosystem 1 is a public-key cryptosystem proposed in 1998 by Bram Cohen .  Key generation  In Cohen's cryptosystem, private key is a positive integer   p   p   p   .  The algorithm uses   k   k   k   public-keys     w  0   ,  …  ,   w   k  -  1        subscript  w  0   normal-…   subscript  w    k  1      w_{0},\ldots,w_{k-1}   defined as follows:  Generate   k   k   k   random integers     u  0   ,  …  ,   u   k  -  1        subscript  u  0   normal-…   subscript  u    k  1      u_{0},\ldots,u_{k-1}   chosen randomly and uniformly between    -  B      B    -B   and   B   B   B   . Where   B   B   B   is some bound.  Let    A  =   ⌊   p   2  k    ⌋       A      p    2  k       A=\lfloor\frac{p}{2k}\rfloor   and generate   k   k   k   random integers     v  0   ,  …  ,   v   k  -  1        subscript  v  0   normal-…   subscript  v    k  1      v_{0},\ldots,v_{k-1}   chosen randomly and uniformly between   0   0    and   A   A   A   .  Define     w  i   =   (     u  i   p   +   v  i    )        subscript  w  i        subscript  u  i   p    subscript  v  i      w_{i}=(u_{i}p+v_{i})   .  Encrypting a bit  To encrypt a bit   m   m   m   Alice randomly adds    k  2      k  2    \frac{k}{2}   public keys and multiplies the result by either 1 (if she wishes to send a 0) or by −1 (if she wishes to send a 1) to obtain the ciphertext    c  =     (   -  1   )   m    ∑   w  i         c     superscript    1   m      subscript  w  i       c=(-1)^{m}\sum w_{i}   .  De-cryption  To de-crypt, Bob computes    h  =   c  mod  p   =     (   -  1   )   m    ∑   v  i           h   modulo  c  p           superscript    1   m      subscript  v  i        h=c\mod p=(-1)^{m}\sum v_{i}     It is easy to see that if    m  =  0      m  0    m=0   then    p  >  h  >   p  /  2         p  h         p  2      p>h>p/2   then $p>h>p/2$ . Hence Bob can read the bit sent by Alice on the most significant bit of h.  References    "  Category:Cryptography     ↩
