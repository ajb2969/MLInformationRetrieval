Cohen's cryptosystem

Cohen's cryptosystem1 is a public-key cryptosystem proposed in 1998 by Bram Cohen.
Key generation
In Cohen's cryptosystem, private key is a positive integer 
 
 
 
 .
The algorithm uses 
 
 
 
  public-keys 
 
 
 
  defined as follows:
Generate 
 
 
 
  random integers 
 
 
 
  chosen randomly and uniformly between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Where 
 
 
 
  is some bound.
Let 
 
 
 
  and generate 
 
 
 
  random integers 
 
 
 
  chosen randomly and uniformly between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Define 
 
 
 
 .
Encrypting a bit
To encrypt a bit 
 
 
 
  Alice randomly adds 
 
 
 
  public keys and multiplies the result by either 1 (if she wishes to send a 0) or by âˆ’1 (if she wishes to send a 1) to obtain the ciphertext 
 
 
 
 .
De-cryption
To de-crypt, Bob computes 
 
 

It is easy to see that if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  then $p>h>p/2$. Hence Bob can read the bit sent by Alice on the most significant bit of h.
