Stieltjes moment problem

In mathematics, the Stieltjes moment problem, named after Thomas Joannes Stieltjes, seeks necessary and sufficient conditions for a sequence { mn, : n = 0, 1, 2, ... } to be of the form



for some measure μ. If such a function μ exists, one asks whether it is unique.
The essential difference between this and other well-known moment problems is that this is on a half-line [0, ∞), whereas in the Hausdorff moment problem one considers a bounded interval [0, 1], and in the Hamburger moment problem one considers the whole line (−∞, ∞).
Existence
Let



and



Then { mn : n = 1, 2, 3, ... } is a moment sequence of some measure on 
 
 
 
  with infinite support if and only if for all n, both



{ mn : n = 1, 2, 3, ... } is a moment sequence of some measure on 
 
 
 
  with finite support of size m if and only if for all 
 
 
 
 , both



and for all larger 
 
 




Uniqueness
There are several sufficient conditions for uniqueness, for example, Carleman's condition, which states that the solution is unique if
