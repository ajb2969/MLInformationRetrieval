Essential manifold

Essential manifold a special type of closed manifolds. The notion was first introduced explicitly by Mikhail Gromov.1
Definition
A closed manifold M is called essential if its fundamental class [M] defines a nonzero element in the homology of its fundamental group π, or more precisely in the homology of the corresponding Eilenberg–MacLane space K(π, 1), via the natural homomorphism


 
 , where n is the dimension of M. Here the fundamental class is taken in homology with integer coefficients if the manifold is orientable, and in coefficients modulo 2, otherwise.
Examples

All closed surfaces (i.e. 2-dimensional manifolds) are essential with the exception of the 2-sphere S2.
Real projective space RPn is essential since the inclusion
 
 




is injective in homology, where
 
 



is the Eilenberg–MacLane space of the finite cyclic group of order 2.
 


All compact aspherical manifolds are essential;
 
In particular all compact hyperbolic manifolds are essential.

All lens spaces are essential.

Properties

Connected sum of essential manifolds is essential.
