   Essential manifold      Essential manifold   Essential manifold a special type of closed manifolds. The notion was first introduced explicitly by Mikhail Gromov . 1  Definition  A closed manifold  M is called essential if its fundamental class [ M ] defines a nonzero element in the homology of its fundamental group  π , or more precisely in the homology of the corresponding Eilenberg–MacLane space  K ( π , 1), via the natural homomorphism        H  n    (  M  )    →    H  n    (   K   (  π  ,  1  )    )       normal-→     subscript  H  n   M      subscript  H  n     K   π  1       H_{n}(M)\to H_{n}(K(\pi,1))   , where n is the dimension of M . Here the fundamental class is taken in homology with integer coefficients if the manifold is orientable, and in coefficients modulo 2, otherwise.  Examples   All closed surfaces (i.e. 2-dimensional manifolds) are essential with the exception of the 2-sphere S 2 .  Real projective space RP n is essential since the inclusion      ℝ   ℙ  n    →   ℝ   ℙ  ∞       normal-→    ℝ   superscript  ℙ  n      ℝ   superscript  ℙ       \mathbb{RP}^{n}\to\mathbb{RP}^{\infty}       is injective in homology, where      ℝ   ℙ  ∞    =   K   (   ℤ  2   ,  1  )          ℝ   superscript  ℙ       K    subscript  ℤ  2   1      \mathbb{RP}^{\infty}=K(\mathbb{Z}_{2},1)      is the Eilenberg–MacLane space of the finite cyclic group of order 2.    All compact aspherical manifolds are essential;  In particular all compact hyperbolic manifolds are essential.   All lens spaces are essential.   Properties   Connected sum of essential manifolds is essential.
