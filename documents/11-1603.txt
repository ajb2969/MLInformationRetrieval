   RNA uridylyltransferase      RNA uridylyltransferase   In enzymology , a RNA uridylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UTP + RNAn   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + RNAn + 1   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UTP and RNAn , whereas its two products are diphosphate and RNAn+1 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is UTP:RNA uridylyltransferase . Other names in common use include terminal uridylyltransferase , and TUT .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 8 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , and .
