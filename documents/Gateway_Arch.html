<p>The Gateway Arch was designed by <a class="uri" href="Finnish-American" title="wikilink">Finnish-American</a> architect <a href="Eero_Saarinen" title="wikilink">Eero Saarinen</a> in 1947; construction began on February 12, 1963, and was completed on October 28, 1965,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> for $13 million<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> (equivalent to $ in ). The monument opened to the public on June 10, 1967.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>Around late 1933, civic leader <a href="Luther_Ely_Smith" title="wikilink">Luther Ely Smith</a>, returning to St. Louis from the <a href="George_Rogers_Clark_National_Historical_Park" title="wikilink">George Rogers Clark National Historical Park</a> in <a href="Vincennes,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Vincennes, Indiana</a>, saw the St. Louis riverfront area and envisioned that building a memorial there would both revive the riverfront and stimulate the economy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He communicated his idea to mayor <a href="Bernard_Dickmann" title="wikilink">Bernard Dickmann</a>, who on December 15, 1933, raised it in a meeting with city leaders. They sanctioned the proposal, and the nonprofit Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Association (JNEMA—pronounced "Jenny May")<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> was formed. Smith was appointed chairman and Dickmann vice chairman. The association's goal was to create:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>  Many locals did not approve of depleting public funds for the cause. SaLees, Smith's daughter, related that when "people would tell him we needed more practical things", he would respond that "spiritual things" were equally important.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>The association expected that $30 million would be needed to undertake the construction of such a monument. It called upon the federal government to foot three-quarters of the bill ($22.5 million).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="File:St._Louis_riverfront_after_demolition_for_Gateway_Arch_(1942).jpg" title="wikilink">thumb |left |The St. Louis riverfront after demolition</a> The suggestion to renew the riverfront was not original, as previous projects were attempted but lacked popularity. The Jefferson memorial idea emerged amid the economic disarray of the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a> and promised new jobs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The project was expected to create 5,000 jobs for three to four years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Committee members began to raise public awareness by organizing fundraisers and writing pamphlets. They also engaged Congress by planning budgets and preparing bills, in addition to researching ownership of the land they had chosen, "approximately one-half mile in length ... from Third Street east to the present elevated railroad." In January 1934, Senator <a href="Bennett_Champ_Clark" title="wikilink">Bennett Champ Clark</a> and Representative <a href="John_J._Cochran" title="wikilink">John Cochran</a> introduced to Congress an <a href="appropriation_bill" title="wikilink">appropriation bill</a> seeking $30 million for the memorial, but the bill failed to garner support due to the large amount of money solicited. In March of the same year, <a href="joint_resolution" title="wikilink">joint resolutions</a> proposed the establishment of a federal commission to develop the memorial. Although the proposal aimed for only authorization, the bill incurred opposition because people suspected that JNEMA would later seek appropriation. On March 28 the Senate bill was reported out, and on April 5 it was turned over to the House Library Committee, which later reported favorably on the bills. On June 8, both the Senate and House bills were passed. On June 15, then President <a href="Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> <a href="wikt:sign_into_law" title="wikilink">signed the bill into law</a>, instituting the United States Territorial Expansion Memorial Commission. The commission comprised 15 members, chosen by Roosevelt, the House, the Senate, and JNEMA. It first convened on December 19 in St. Louis, where members examined the project and its planned location.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, in December, the JNEMA discussed organizing an architectural competition to determine the design of the monument. Local architect Louis LeBeaume had drawn up competition guidelines by January 1935.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> On April 13, 1935, the commission certified JNEMA's project proposals, including memorial perimeters, the "historical significance" of the memorial, the competition, and the $30 million budget.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Between February and April, the <a href="Missouri_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">Missouri State Legislature</a> passed an act allowing the use of <a href="bond_(finance)" title="wikilink">bonds</a> to facilitate the project. On April 15, then <a href="List_of_Governors_of_Missouri" title="wikilink">Governor</a> <a href="Guy_Brasfield_Park" title="wikilink">Guy B. Park</a> signed it into law. Dickmann and Smith applied for funding from two <a href="New_Deal_agency" title="wikilink">New Deal agencies</a>—the <a href="Public_Works_Administration" title="wikilink">Public Works Administration</a> (headed by <a href="Harold_L._Ickes" title="wikilink">Harold Ickes</a>) and the <a href="Works_Progress_Administration" title="wikilink">Works Progress Administration</a> (headed by <a href="Harry_Hopkins" title="wikilink">Harry Hopkins</a>). On August 7, both Ickes and Hopkins assented to the funding requests, each promising $10,000,000, and said that the <a href="National_Park_Service" title="wikilink">National Park Service</a> (NPS) would manage the memorial.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> A local bond issue election granting $7.5 million for the memorial's development was held on September 10 and passed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>On December 21, <a href="Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> signed <a href="Executive_order_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Executive Order</a> 7253<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> to approve the memorial,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> allocating the 82-acre area as the first <a href="National_Historic_Sites_(United_States)" title="wikilink">National Historic Site</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The order also appropriated $3.3 million through the WPA and $3.45 million through the PWA<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> ($6,750,000 in total).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The motivation of the project was twofold—commemorating westward expansion and <a href="Job_creation_program" title="wikilink">creating jobs</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Some taxpayers began to file suits to impede the monument, which they called a "<a href="boondoggle_(project)" title="wikilink">boondoggle</a>".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>Using the 1935 grant of $6.75 million and $2.25 million in city bonds,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> the NPS acquired the buildings within the historic site—through <a href="Eminent_domain#Condemnation" title="wikilink">condemnation</a> rather than purchase—and demolished them. By September 1938, condemnation was complete. The condemnation was subject to many legal disputes which culminated on January 27, 1939, when the <a href="United_States_courts_of_appeals" title="wikilink">United States Circuit Court of Appeals</a> ruled that condemnation was valid. A total of $6.2 million was distributed to land owners on June 14.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Demolition commenced on October 10, 1939, when Dickmann extracted three bricks from a vacant warehouse.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>Led by Paul Peters, adversaries of the memorial delivered to Congress a leaflet titled "Public Necessity or Just Plain Pork". The JNEMA's lawyer, Bon Geaslin, believed that the flyers did not taint the project, but motivated members of Congress to find out more about the same. Although Representative John Cochran wanted to ask Congress to approve more funds, Geaslin believed the association should "keep a low profile, maintaining its current position during this session of Congress". He advised the association to "get a good strong editorial in one of the papers to the effect that a small group of tenants ... is soliciting funds [to fight] the proposed improvement, and stating that these efforts do not represent the consensus of opinion in St. Louis ..., and pointing out that such obstructions should be condemned".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>Congress's reduction in spending made it impossible for the allocated funds to be obtained. NPS responded that the city would reduce its contribution if the federal government did. It also asserted that the funds were sanctioned by an executive order, but superintendent John Nagle pointed out that what "one Executive Order does, another can undo". In March 1936, Representative Cochran commented during a House meeting that he "would not vote for any measure providing for building the memorial or allotting funds to it". Geaslin found Cochran's statements to be a greater hindrance to the project than Paul Peters' opposition, for Congress might have Cochran's opinions as representative of public opinion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>Peters and other opponents asked Roosevelt to rescind Executive Order 7253 and to redirect the money to the <a href="American_Red_Cross" title="wikilink">American Red Cross</a>. Smith impugned their motives, accusing them of being "opposed to anything that is ever advanced in behalf of the city."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In February 1936, an editorial written by Paul W. Ward in <em><a href="The_Nation" title="wikilink">The Nation</a></em> denounced the project.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Smith was infuriated, fearing the impact of attacks from a prestigious magazine, and wanted "to jump on it strong with hammer and tongs". <a href="William_Allen_White" title="wikilink">William Allen White</a>, a renowned newspaper editor, advised Smith not to fret.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>Because the Mississippi River played an essential role in establishing St. Louis' identity as the gateway to the west, a memorial commemorating it should be near the river. Railroad tracks that had been constructed in the 1930s on the <a class="uri" href="levee" title="wikilink">levee</a> obstructed views of the riverfront from the memorial site.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> When Ickes declared that the railway must be removed before he would allocate funds for the memorial,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> President of the St. Louis Board of Public Service Baxter Brown suggested that "a new tunnel ... conceal the relocated tracks and re-grading of the site to elevate it over the tunnel. These modifications would eliminate the elevated and surface tracks and open up the views to the river."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Although rejected by NPS architect <a href="Charles_E._Peterson" title="wikilink">Charles Peterson</a>, Brown's proposal formed the basis for the ultimate settlement.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>In November 1944, Smith discussed with <a href="Newton_B._Drury" title="wikilink">Newton Drury</a>, the <a href="National_Park_Service#Directors" title="wikilink">National Park Service Director</a>, the design of the memorial, asserting that the memorial should be "transcending in spiritual and aesthetic values," best represented by "one central feature: a single shaft, a building, an arch, or something else that would symbolize American culture and civilization."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p>The idea of an architectural competition to determine the design of the memorial was favored at the JNEMA's inaugural meeting. They planned to award cash for the best design.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> In January 1945, the JNEMA officially announced a two-stage design competition that would cost $225,000 to organize. Smith and the JNEMA struggled to raise the funds, garnering only a third of the required total by June 1945.<mtpl>{{#tag:ref |Once he revisited a generous sponsor, requesting more money: "Now you have to protect your investment".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> |group=lower-alpha}}</mtpl> Then mayor <a href="Aloys_P._Kaufmann" title="wikilink">Aloys Kaufmann</a> feared that the lack of public support would lead officials to abandon hope in the project. The passage of a year brought little success, and Smith frantically <a href="Underwriting" title="wikilink">underwrote</a> the remaining $40,000 in May 1946. By June, Smith found others to assume portions of his underwriting, with $17,000 remaining under his sponsorship. In February 1947, the underwriters were compensated, and the fund stood over $231,199.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p>Local architect Louis LaBeaume prepared a set of specifications for the design, and architect <a href="George_Howe_(architect)" title="wikilink">George Howe</a> was chosen to coordinate the competition. On May 30, 1947, the contest officially opened. The seven-member jury that would judge the designs comprised <a href="Charles_Nagel_(architect)" title="wikilink">Charles Nagel Jr.</a>, <a href="Richard_Neutra" title="wikilink">Richard Neutra</a>, <a href="Roland_Wank" title="wikilink">Roland Wank</a>, <a href="William_Wurster" title="wikilink">William Wurster</a>, LaBeaume, <a href="Fiske_Kimball" title="wikilink">Fiske Kimball</a>, and S. Herbert Hare.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The competition comprised two stages—the first to narrow down the designers to five and the second to single out one architect and his design.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The design intended to include:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> </p>

<p><a href="File:Eero_Saarinen_with_Gateway_Arch_Model.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb |left |Saarinen working with a model of the arch in 1957</a> Saarinen's team included himself as designer, J. Henderson Barr as associate designer, and <a href="Dan_Kiley" title="wikilink">Dan Kiley</a> as landscape architect, as well as <a href="Lilian_Swann_Saarinen" title="wikilink">Lily Swann Saarinen</a> as sculptor and <a href="Alexander_Girard" title="wikilink">Alexander Girard</a> as painter. In the first stage of the competition, <a href="Carl_Milles" title="wikilink">Carl Milles</a> advised Saarinen to change the bases of each leg to triangles instead of squares. Saarinen said that he "worked at first with mathematical shapes, but finally adjusted it according to the eye." At submission, Saarinen's plans laid out the arch at  tall and  wide from center to center of the triangle bases.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p>On September 1, 1947, submissions for the first stage were received by the jury. The submissions were labeled by numbers only, and the names of the designers were kept anonymous. Upon four days of deliberation, the jury narrowed down the 172 submissions, which included Saarinen's father <a href="Eliel_Saarinen" title="wikilink">Eliel</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> to five finalists, and announced the corresponding numbers to the media on September 27. Saarinen's design (#144) was among the finalists, and comments written on it included "relevant, beautiful, perhaps inspired would be the right word" (Roland Wank) and "an abstract form peculiarly happy in its symbolism" (Charles Nagel). Hare questioned the feasibility of the design but appreciated the thoughtfulness behind it.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Local St. Louis architect <a href="Harris_Armstrong" title="wikilink">Harris Armstrong</a> was also one of the finalists.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The secretary who sent out the telegrams informing finalists of their advancement mistakenly sent one to Eliel rather than Eero.

Eliel "'broke out a second bottle of champagne' to toast his son."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p>They proceeded to the second stage, and each was given a $10,000 prize. Saarinen changed the height of the arch from 580 feet to <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> and wrote that the arch symbolized "the gateway to the West, the national expansion, and whatnot."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> He wanted the landscape surrounding the arch to "be so densely covered with trees that it will be a forest-like park, a green retreat from the tension of the downtown city," according to <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> architectural critic Aline Bernstein Louchheim<mtpl>{{#tag:ref |In 1954, Louchheim married Saarinen.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> |group=lower-alpha}}</mtpl> The deadline for the second stage arrived on February 10, 1948, and on February 18, the jury chose Saarinen's design unanimously,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> praising its "profoundly evocative and truly monumental expression."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The following day,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> during a formal dinner at <a href="Hotel_Statler_(St._Louis,_Missouri)" title="wikilink">Statler Hotel</a> that the finalists and the media attended, Wurster pronounced Saarinen the winner of the competition and awarded the checks—$40,000 to his team<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> and $50,000 to Saarinen.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The competition was the first major architectural design that Saarinen developed unaided by his father.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>On May 25, the United States Territorial Expansion Memorial Commission endorsed the design.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Later, in June, the NPS approved the proposal.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Representative <a href="H._R._Gross" title="wikilink">H. R. Gross</a>, however, opposed the allocation of federal funds for the arch's development.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<p>The design drew varied responses. In a February 29, 1948, <em>The New York Times</em> article, Louchheim praised the arch's design as "a modern monument, fitting, beautiful and impressive."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Some local residents likened it to a "stupendous hairpin and a stainless steel hitching post." The most aggressive criticism emerged from <a href="Gilmore_David_Clarke" title="wikilink">Gilmore D. Clarke</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> whose February 26, 1948,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> letter compared Saarinen's arch to an arch imagined by fascist <a href="Benito_Mussolini" title="wikilink">Benito Mussolini</a>, rendering the arch a fascist symbol. This allegation of plagiarism ignited fierce debates among architects about its validity. <a href="Douglas_Haskell" title="wikilink">Douglas Haskell</a> from New York wrote that "The use of a common form is not plagiarism.... [T]his particular accusation amounts to the filthiest smear that has been attempted by a man highly placed in the architectural profession in our generation."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Wurster and the jury refuted the charges, arguing that "the arch form was not inherently fascist but was indeed part of the entire history of architecture."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Saarinen considered the opposition absurd, asserting, "It's just preposterous to think that a basic form, based on a completely natural figure, should have any ideological connection."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>

<p>By January 1951, Saarinen created 21 "drawings, including profiles of the Arch, scale drawings of the museums and restaurants, various parking proposals, the effect of the levee-tunnel railroad plan on the Arch footings, the Arch foundations, the Third Street Expressway, and the internal and external structure of the Arch." <a href="Fred_Severud" title="wikilink">Fred Severud</a> made calculations for the arch's structure.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="railroad-agreement-19491952">Railroad agreement (1949–1952)</h3>

<p>Several proposals were offered for moving the railroad tracks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bates-Ross. Tracks would cross the memorial site diagonally in a tunnel.</li>
<li>Bowen. Similar to Bates-Ross proposal.</li>
<li>Hill-Tunnel. Supported by Saarinen and NPS engineer Julian Spotts, it would route the tracks in a tunnel below Second and First Streets. Saarinen further said that if the tracks passed between the memorial and the river, he would withdraw his participation.</li>
<li>La Beaume-Terminal. Opposed by Saarinen and the NPS, it would lay "three tracks on a contained fill along the lines of the elevated tracks."</li>
<li>Levee-Tunnel. Proposed by Frank J. McDevitt, president of the St. Louis Board of Public Service, it would lower the tracks into a tunnel concealed by walls and landscaping.</li>
</ul>

<p>On July 7, 1949, in Mayor <a href="Joseph_Darst" title="wikilink">Joseph Darst</a>'s office, city officials chose the Levee-Tunnel plan, rousing JNEMA members who held that the decision had been pressed through when Smith was away on vacation. Darst notified Secretary of the Interior <a href="Julius_Krug" title="wikilink">Julius Krug</a> of the city's selection. Krug planned to meet with Smith and JNEM but canceled the meeting and resigned on November 11. His successor, <a href="Oscar_L._Chapman" title="wikilink">Oscar L.

A day after the conference, they ratified a <a href="memorandum_of_understanding" title="wikilink">memorandum of understanding</a> about the plan: "The five tracks on the levee would be replaced by three tracks, one owned by the <a href="Missouri_Pacific_Railroad" title="wikilink">Missouri Pacific Railroad</a> (MPR) and two by the <a href="Terminal_Railroad_Association_of_St._Louis" title="wikilink">Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis</a> (TRRA) proceeding through a tunnel not longer than 3,000 feet. The tunnel would be approximately fifty feet west of the current elevated line." It would also have an overhead clearance of , lower than the regular requirement of .

<p>In August 1953, Secretary of the Interior <a href="Fred_Andrew_Seaton" title="wikilink">Fred A. Seaton</a> declared that the Department of the Interior and the railroads should finalize the agreement on the new route. In October, NPS and the TRRA decided that the TRRA would employ a surveyor endorsed by Spotts "to survey, design, estimate, and report on" the expenses of shifting the tracks. They chose Alfred Benesch and Associates, which released its final report on May 3, 1957. The firm estimated the that two proposals would cost more than expected: more than $11 million and $14 million, respectively. NPS director <a href="Conrad_L._Wirth" title="wikilink">Conrad Wirth</a> enjoined Saarinen to make small modifications to the design. In October, Saarinen redrafted the plans, suggesting:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a>  On November 29, involved interests signed another memorandum of understanding approving Saarinen's rework; implementing it would cost about $5.053 million. On March 10, 1959, mayor <a href="Raymond_Tucker" title="wikilink">Raymond Tucker</a> proposed that they drop "the tunnel idea in favor of open cuts roofed with concrete slabs," which would cost $2.684 million, $1.5 million less than the cost of the approved plan. On May 12, 1958, Tucker, TRRA president Armstrong Chinn, and Missouri Pacific Railroad president Russell Dearmont entered a written agreement: "The TRRA would place $500,000 in escrow for the project, and the city [would] sell $980,000 of the 1935 bonds to match the Federal contribution." Director Wirth and Secretary Seaton approved the plan on June 2.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>

<p>In July 1953, Representative <a href="Leonor_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Leonor Sullivan</a> introduced H.R. 6549, a bill authorizing the allocation of no more than $5 million to build the arch. After much negotiation, both houses of Congress approved the bill in May 1954, and on May 18, 1954, President <a href="Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="wikilink">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> signed the bill into law as Public Law 361. Congress could not afford to appropriate the funds in 1955, so association president William Crowdus resorted to asking the <a href="Rockefeller_Foundation" title="wikilink">Rockefeller</a> and <a href="Ford_Foundation" title="wikilink">Ford Foundations</a> for $10 million. The foundations denied the request because their function as <a href="private_foundation_(United_States)" title="wikilink">private foundations</a> did not include funding national memorials. In 1956, Congress appropriated $2.64 million to be used to move the railroad tracks. The remainder of the authorized appropriation was requested via six congressional bills, introduced on July 1, 1958, that revised Public Law 361 to encompass the cost of the entire memorial, increasing federal funds by $12.25 million. A month later the Department of the Interior and the <a href="Office_of_Management_and_Budget" title="wikilink">Bureau of the Budget</a> endorsed the bill, and both houses of Congress unanimously passed the bill. Eisenhower signed it into law on September 7. The NPS held off on appropriating the additional funds, as it planned to use the already-appropriated funds to initiate the railroad work.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn83" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>

<p>Saarinen and city functionaries collaborated to <a href="zoning" title="wikilink">zone</a> buildings near the arch. In April 1959, real estate developer Lewis Kitchen decided to construct two 40-level edifices across from the arch. In July, after the plan was condemned for its potential obstruction of the arch, Kitchen discussed the issue with officials. A decision was delayed for several months because Saarinen had yet to designate the arch's height, projected between . By October, Mayor Tucker and Director Wirth resolved to restrict the height of buildings opposite the arch to  (about 27 levels), and the city stated that plans for buildings opposite the arch would require its endorsement. Kitchen then decreased the height of his buildings, while Saarinen increased that of the arch.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>

<p>Moving the railroad tracks was the first stage of the project. On May 6, 1959, after an official conference, the Public Service Commission called for ventilation to accompany the tunnel's construction, which entailed "placing 3,000 feet of dual tracks into a tunnel 105 feet west of the elevated railroad, along with filling, grading, and trestle work." Eight bids for the work were reviewed on June 8 in the Old Courthouse, and the MacDonald Construction Co. of St. Louis<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn85" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> won with a bid of $2,426,115, less than NPS' estimate of the cost. At 10:30 a.m. on June 23, 1959, the <a class="uri" href="groundbreaking" title="wikilink">groundbreaking</a> ceremony occurred; Tucker spaded the first portion of earth. Wirth and Dickmann delivered speeches.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn86" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>

<p>The NPS acquired the $500,000 in escrow and transferred it to MacDonald to begin building the new tracks. In August, demolition of the Old Rock House<mtpl>{{#tag:ref |Built in 1818 by <a href="Manuel_Lisa" title="wikilink">Manuel Lisa</a>, it was St. Louis' oldest standing building when Roosevelt approved the memorial in 1935.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> |group=lower-alpha}}</mtpl> was complete, with workers beginning to excavate the tunnel. In November, they began shaping the tunnel's walls with concrete. Twenty-nine percent of the construction was completed by March and 95% by November. On November 17, trains began to use the new tracks. June 1962 was the projected date of fruition.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn88" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>

<p>On May 16, 1959, the <a href="United_States_Senate_Appropriations_Subcommittee_on_Interior,_Environment,_and_Related_Agencies" title="wikilink">Senate appropriations subcommittee</a> received from St. Louis legislators a request for $2.4911 million, of which it granted only $133,000. Wirth recommended that they reseek the funds in January 1960.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn89" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>

<p>On March 10, 1959, Regional Director Howard Baker received $888,000 as the city's first subsidy for the project. On December 1, 1961, $23,003,150 in total had been authorized, with $19,657,483 already appropriated—$3,345,667 remained not yet appropriated.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn90" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>

<p>The bidding date, originally December 20, 1961, was postponed to January 22, 1962, to clarify the details of the arch construction.<mtpl>{{#tag:ref |This deferral delayed the construction's ultimate completion, which had been slated for St. Louis' bicentennial.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn91" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> |group=lower-alpha}}</mtpl> About 50 companies that had requested the construction requirements received bidding invitations. Extending from $11,923,163 to $12,765,078, all four bids exceeded the engineer estimate of $8,067,000. Wirth had a committee led by <a href="George_B._Hartzog,_Jr." title="wikilink">George Hartzog</a> determine the validity of the bids in light of the government's conditions. Following a meeting with the bidders, the committee affirmed the bids' reasonableness, and Wirth awarded the lowest bidder, MacDonald Construction Co. of St. Louis,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn92" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> the contract for the construction of the arch and the visitor center. On March 14, 1962, he signed the contract and received from Tucker $2,500,000, the city's subsidy for the phase.

<p>The project manager of MacDonald Construction Co., Stan Wolf, said that a 62-story building was easier to build than the arch: "In a building, everything is straight up, one thing on top of another.

<p>Although an <a href="actuary" title="wikilink">actuarial</a> firm predicted thirteen workers would die while building the arch, no workers were killed during the monument's construction.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn109" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> However, construction of the arch was still often delayed by safety checks, funding uncertainties, and legal disputes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn110" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>

<p>Civil rights activists regarded the construction of the arch as a token of racial discrimination. While African Americans worked on the arch, none were skilled laborers. On July 14, 1964, during the workers' lunchtime, civil rights protesters Percy Green and Richard Daly, both members of <a href="Congress_of_Racial_Equality" title="wikilink">Congress of Racial Equality</a>, climbed up 125-feet on the north leg of the arch to "expose the fact that federal funds were being used to build a national monument that was racially discriminating against black contractors and skilled black workers." As the pair disregarded demands to get off, protesters on the ground demanded that at least 10% of the skilled jobs belong to African Americans. Four hours later Green and Daly dismounted from the arch, to charges of "trespassing, peace disturbance, and resisting arrest."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn111" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn112" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> This incident <em>inter alia</em> spurred the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Justice" title="wikilink">United States Department of Justice</a> to file the first <a href="Disparate_treatment#Pattern_or_Practice_Discrimination" title="wikilink">pattern or practice</a> case against AFL–CIO under <a href="Title_VII" title="wikilink">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>, on February 4, 1966, but the department later called off the charges.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn113" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1964, the Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Company of Warren, Pennsylvania sued MacDonald for $665,317 for tax concerns. In 1965, NPS requested that Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel remove the prominent letters "P-D-M" (its initials) from a creeper derrick used for construction, contending that it was promotional and violated federal law with regards to advertising on national monuments. Although Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel initially refused to pursue what it considered a precarious venture, the company relented after discovering that leaving the initials would cost $225,000 and after that, $42,000 per month,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn114" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> and the NPS dropped its lawsuit.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn115" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>

<p>On October 26, 1965, the <a href="International_Association_of_Ironworkers" title="wikilink">International Association of Ironworkers</a> delayed work to ascertain that the arch was safe.

<p>This <a href="hyperbolic_function" title="wikilink">hyperbolic cosine function</a> describes the shape of a <a class="uri" href="catenary" title="wikilink">catenary</a>. A chain that supports only its own weight forms a catenary; in this configuration, the chain is purely in tension.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn171" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn172" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> Likewise, an inverted catenary arch that supports only its own weight is purely in compression, with no shear.

In 1959, he caused some confusion about the actual shape of the arch when he wrote, "This arch is not a true <a class="uri" href="parabola" title="wikilink">parabola</a>, as is often stated. Instead it is a catenary curve—the curve of a hanging chain—a curve in which the forces of thrust are continuously kept within the center of the legs of the arch." William V.

<h4 id="incidents">Incidents</h4>

<p>On July 8, 1970, a six-year-old boy, his mother, and two of her friends were trapped in a tram in the arch's south leg after the monument closed. According to the boy's mother, the group went up the arch around 9:30 p.m. <a href="Central_Daylight_Time" title="wikilink">CDT</a>, but when the tram reached the de-boarding area, its doors did not open. The tram then reportedly traveled up to a storage area  above the ground, and the power was switched off.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn244" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> One person was able to pry open the tram door and the four managed to reach a security guard for help after being trapped for about 45 minutes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn245" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a></p>

<p>On July 21, 2007, a broken cable forced the south tram to be shut down, leaving only the north tram in service until repairs were completed in March 2008.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn246" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> Around 200 tourists were stuck inside the arch for up to three hours because the severed cable contacted a high-voltage rail, causing a <a href="electrical_fuse" title="wikilink">fuse</a> to blow. The north tram was temporarily affected by the power outage as well, but some passengers were able to exit the arch through the emergency stairs and elevator. It was about two hours until all the tram riders safely descended, while those in the observation area at the time of the outage had to wait an additional hour before being able to travel back down. An arch official said the visitors, most of whom stayed calm during the ordeal, were not in any danger; they were later given refunds.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn247" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a> The incident occurred while visitors in the arch were watching a fireworks display, and no one was seriously injured in the event. However, two people received medical treatment; one person needed <a class="uri" href="oxygen" title="wikilink">oxygen</a> and the other was <a class="uri" href="diabetic" title="wikilink">diabetic</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn248" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> Almost immediately after the tram returned to service, however, it was closed again for new repairs after an electrical switch broke. The incident, which occurred on March 14, 2008, was billed as a "bad coincidence."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn249" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a></p>

<p>On the morning of February 9, 2011, a National Park Service worker was injured while performing repairs on the south tram. The 55-year-old was working on the tram's electrical system when he was trapped between it and the arch wall for around 30 seconds, until being saved by other workers. Emergency officials treated the injured NPS employee at the arch's top before taking him to <a href="Saint_Louis_University_Hospital" title="wikilink">Saint Louis University Hospital</a> in serious condition.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn250" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a></p>

<p>On March 24, 2011, around one hundred visitors were stranded in the observation area for 45 minutes after the doors of the south tram refused to close. The tourists were safely brought down the arch in the north tram, which had been closed that week so officials could upgrade it with a new electronic transportation system. The National Park Service later attributed the malfunction to a computer glitch associated with the new system, which had already been implemented with the south tram. No one was hurt in the occurrence, but the arch suffered a slight loss in <a href="spring_break" title="wikilink">spring break</a> tourism revenue.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn251" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn252" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a></p>

<p>Around 2:15 p.m. local time on June 16, 2011, the arch's north tram stalled due to a power outage.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn253" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a> The tram became stuck about  from the observation deck, and passengers eventually were told to climb the stairs to the observation area.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn254" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a> It took National Park Service workers about one hour to manually pull the tram to the top, and the 40 trapped passengers were able to return down on the south tram, which had previously not been operating that day because there was not an abundance of visitors. An additional 120 people were at the observation deck at the time of the outage and also exited via the south tram. During the outage, visitors were stuck in the tram with neither lighting nor air conditioning.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn255" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a> No one was seriously injured in the incident, but one visitor lost consciousness after suffering a <a href="panic_attack" title="wikilink">panic attack</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn256" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a> and a park ranger was taken away with minor injuries. The cause of the outage was not immediately known.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn257" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="File:STL_Skyline_2007_edit_cropped.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb |right |The arch in September 2007</a> On June 16, 1965, the <a href="Federal_Aviation_Administration" title="wikilink">Federal Aviation Administration</a> cautioned that aviators who flew through the arch would be fined and their licenses revoked.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn258" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a> At least ten pilots have disobeyed this order,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn259" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a> beginning on June 22, 1966.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn260" id="fnref260"><sup>260</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1973, Nikki Caplan was granted an FAA exception to fly a <a href="hot_air_balloon" title="wikilink">hot air balloon</a> between the arch's legs as part of the <a href="Great_Forest_Park_Balloon_Race" title="wikilink">Great Forest Park Balloon Race</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn261" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a> During the flight, on which the St. Louis park director was a passenger, the balloon hit the arch and plummeted 70 feet before recovering.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn262" id="fnref262"><sup>262</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1976, a <a href="U.S._Army" title="wikilink">U.S. Army</a> exhibition skydiving team was permitted to fly through the arch as part of <a href="Fourth_of_July" title="wikilink">Fourth of July</a> festivities.,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn263" id="fnref263"><sup>263</sup></a> and since then, numerous skydiving exhibition teams have legally jumped onto the Arch grounds, after having flown their parachutes through the legs of the Arch.</p>

<p>The arch has been a target of various <a href="stunt_performer" title="wikilink">stunt performers</a>, and while such feats are generally forbidden, several people have parachuted to or from the arch regardless. In June 1980, the National Park Service declined a request by television producers to have a performer jump from the arch; a similar appeal by stuntman Dan Koko was also turned away in February 1986.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn264" id="fnref264"><sup>264</sup></a> Koko, who was a <a href="stunt_double" title="wikilink">stunt double</a> for <em><a href="Superman_(1978_film)" title="wikilink">Superman</a></em>, wanted to perform the leap during Fourth of July celebrations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn265" id="fnref265"><sup>265</sup></a> In 2013 Alexander Polli, a European BASE jumper planned to fly a wingsuit under the arch but had his demo postponed by the FAA.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn266" id="fnref266"><sup>266</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="accident">1980 accident</h4>

<p>On November 22, 1980, at about 8:45 a.m. CST, 33-year-old Kenneth Swyers of <a href="Overland,_Missouri" title="wikilink">Overland, Missouri</a>, parachuted on to the top of the arch. His plan was to release his main parachute and then jump off the arch using his reserve parachute to perform a <a href="base_jump" title="wikilink">base jump</a>. Unfortunately, after landing the wind blew him to the side, and he slid down the north leg to his death.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn267" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a> The accident was witnessed by several people, including Swyers' wife, also a parachutist. She said her husband "was not a hot dog, daredevil skydiver" and that he had prepared for the jump two weeks in advance. Swyers, who had made over 1,600 jumps before the incident, was reported by one witness to have "landed very well" on the top of the arch, but "had no footing."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn268" id="fnref268"><sup>268</sup></a> Swyers was reportedly blown to the top of the arch by the wind and was unable to save himself when his reserve parachute failed to deploy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn269" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a> The Federal Aviation Administration said the jump was unauthorized, and investigated the pilot involved in the incident.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn270" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a></p>

<p>On December 27, 1980, St. Louis television station <a class="uri" href="KTVI" title="wikilink">KTVI</a> reported receiving calls from supposed witnesses of another stunt landing. The alleged parachutist, who claimed to be a retired professional stuntman, was said to be wearing a <a href="Santa_Claus" title="wikilink">Santa Claus</a> costume when he jumped off an airplane around 8:00 a.m. CST, parachuted onto the arch, grasped the monument's beacon, and used the same chute to glide down unharmed. KTVI said it was told the feat was done as an act of homage to Swyers, and "apparently was a combination of a dare, a drunk, and a tribute."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn271" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a> On the day after the alleged incident, authorities declared the jump a hoax. A spokesperson for the <a href="St._Louis_Metropolitan_Police_Department" title="wikilink">St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department</a> said no calls were received about the jump until after it was broadcast on the news, and the Federal Aviation Administration said the two calls it had received were very similar. One caller also left an out-of-service phone number, while the other never followed up with investigators.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn272" id="fnref272"><sup>272</sup></a> Arch officials said they did not witness any such jump, and photos provided by the alleged parachutist were unclear.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn273" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="stunt">1992 stunt</h4>

<p><a href="File:Gateway_Arch_from_air.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb |right |Aerial shot of the arch</a> On September 14, 1992, 25-year-old John C. Vincent climbed to the top of the Gateway Arch using <a href="suction_cup" title="wikilink">suction cups</a> and proceeded to parachute back to the ground. He was later charged with two <a href="misdemeanor" title="wikilink">misdemeanors</a>: climbing a national monument and parachuting in a national park. <a href="United_States_Attorney" title="wikilink">Federal prosecutor</a> Stephen Higgins called the act a "great stunt" but said it was "something the Park Service doesn't take lightly."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn274" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a> Vincent, a construction worker and diver from <a href="Harvey,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Harvey</a>, <a class="uri" href="Louisiana" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn275" id="fnref275"><sup>275</sup></a> said he did it "just for the excitement, just for the thrill," and had previously parachuted off the <a href="World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">World Trade Center</a> in May 1991. He said that scaling the arch "wasn't that hard" and had considered a jump off the monument for a few months. In an interview, Vincent said he visited the arch's observation area a month before the stunt, to see if he could use a maintenance hatch for accessing monument's peak. Due to the heavy security, he instead decided to climb up the arch's exterior using suction cups, which he had used before to scale shorter buildings. Dressed in black, Vincent began crawling up the arch around 3:30 a.m. CST on September 14 and arrived undetected at the top around 5:45 a.m., taking an additional 75 minutes to rest and take photos before finally jumping. During this time, he was seen by two traffic reporters inside the <a href="One_Metropolitan_Square" title="wikilink">One Metropolitan Square</a> skyscraper.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn276" id="fnref276"><sup>276</sup></a></p>

<p>Vincent was also spotted mid-air by Deryl Stone, a Chief Ranger for the National Park Service. Stone reported seeing Vincent grab his parachute after landing and run to a nearby car, which quickly drove away. However, authorities were able to detain two men on the ground who had been videotaping the jump.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn277" id="fnref277"><sup>277</sup></a> Stone said 37-year-old Ronald Carroll and 27-year-old Robert Weinzetl, both St. Louis residents, were found with a wireless communication headset and a video camera, as well as a still camera with a <a href="telephoto_lens" title="wikilink">telephoto lens</a>. The two were also charged with two misdemeanors: disorderly conduct and commercial photography in a national park.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn278" id="fnref278"><sup>278</sup></a> Vincent later turned himself in and initially pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn279" id="fnref279"><sup>279</sup></a> However, he eventually accepted a guilty plea deal in which he testified against Carroll and Weinzetl, revealing that the two consented to recording the jump during a meeting of all three on the day before his stunt occurred.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn280" id="fnref280"><sup>280</sup></a> <a href="United_States_magistrate_judge" title="wikilink">Federal magistrate judge</a> David D. Noce ruled on January 28, 1993 that Carroll had been involved in a <a href="conspiracy_(crime)" title="wikilink">conspiracy</a> and was guilty of both misdemeanor charges; the charges against Weinzetl had been dropped by federal attorneys. In his decision, Noce stated, "There are places in our country where the sufficiently skilled can savor the exhilaration and personal satisfaction of accomplishing courageous and intrepid acts, of reaching dreamed-of heights and for coursing dangerous adventures," but added that other places are designed for "the exhilaration of mere observation and for the appreciation of the imaginings and the works of others. The St. Louis Arch and the grounds of the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial are in the latter category."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn281" id="fnref281"><sup>281</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>

<p>Two years after the 1995 <a href="Oklahoma_City_bombing" title="wikilink">Oklahoma City bombing</a>, a little over $1 million was granted to institute a <a class="uri" href="counterterrorism" title="wikilink">counterterrorism</a> program. Park officials were trained to note the activity of tourists, and inconspicuous electronic detection devices were installed. After the <a href="September_11_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11 attacks</a> in 2001, security efforts were more prominent, security checkpoints moved to the entrance of the visitor center.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn282" id="fnref282"><sup>282</sup></a> At the checkpoints, visitors are screened by <a class="uri" href="magnetometers" title="wikilink">magnetometers</a> and <a class="uri" href="x-ray" title="wikilink">x-ray</a> equipment,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn283" id="fnref283"><sup>283</sup></a> devices which have been in place since 1997.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn284" id="fnref284"><sup>284</sup></a></p>

<p>The Arch also became one of several U.S. monuments placed under <a href="restricted_airspace" title="wikilink">restricted airspace</a> during 2002 <a href="Fourth_of_July" title="wikilink">Fourth of July</a> celebrations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn285" id="fnref285"><sup>285</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn286" id="fnref286"><sup>286</sup></a> In 2003, , , <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn287" id="fnref287"><sup>287</sup></a> movable <a href="Jersey_barrier" title="wikilink">Jersey barriers</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn288" id="fnref288"><sup>288</sup></a> were installed to impede terrorist attacks on the arch.

<p>In 2006, arch officials hired a "physical security specialist," replacing a law enforcement officer.

<p><mtpl></mtpl> <a href="File:Gateway_Arch_July_2012.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb |The Gateway Arch as seen from southern leg</a> Built as a monument to the westward expansion of the United States, the arch typifies "the pioneer spirit of the men and women who won the West, and those of a latter day to strive on other frontiers." The arch has become the iconic image of St. Louis,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn292" id="fnref292"><sup>292</sup></a> appearing in many parts of city culture. In 1968, three years after the monument's opening, the St. Louis phone directory contained 65 corporations with "Gateway" in their title and 17 with "Arch". Arches also appeared over gas stations and drive-in restaurants.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn293" id="fnref293"><sup>293</sup></a> In the 1970s, a local sports team adopted the name "Fighting Arches"; <a href="St._Louis_Community_College" title="wikilink">St. Louis Community College</a> would later (when consolidating all athletic programs under a single banner) name its sports teams "Archers". Robert S. Chandler, an NPS superintendent, said, "Most [visitors] are awed by the size and scale of the Arch, but they don't understand what it's all about....

<p>Some have questioned whether St. Louis really was—as Saarinen said<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn305" id="fnref305"><sup>305</sup></a>—the "Gateway to the West". <a href="Kansas_City,_Missouri" title="wikilink">Kansas City</a>-born "deadline poet" <a href="Calvin_Trillin" title="wikilink">Calvin Trillin</a> wrote,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn306" id="fnref306"><sup>306</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="File:St_louis_arch_exterior_welds.jpg" title="wikilink">right |thumb |Welds on the arch's skin seal gaps between 4-by-8-foot sheets of stainless steel. Graffiti is scratched on the lower five to seven feet of the monument.</a> The first act of vandalism was committed in June 1968: the vandals etched their names on various parts of the arch. In all, $10,000 was spent that year to repair damage from vandalism.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn320" id="fnref320"><sup>320</sup></a> The arch was first targeted by <a href="graffiti_artist" title="wikilink">graffiti artists</a> on March 5, 1969.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn321" id="fnref321"><sup>321</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2010, signs of corrosion were reported at the upper regions of the stainless steel surface. Carbon steel in the north leg has been rusting, possibly a result of water accumulation, a side effect of leaky <a href="welding" title="wikilink">welds</a> in an environment that often causes rain inside. Maintenance workers use mops<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn322" id="fnref322"><sup>322</sup></a> and a temporary setup of water containers to ease the problem.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn323" id="fnref323"><sup>323</sup></a> According to NPS documents, the corrosion and rust pose no safety concerns.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn324" id="fnref324"><sup>324</sup></a></p>

<p>A more comprehensive study of the corrosion had been suggested as early as 2006 by architectural specialists studying the Arch, and reiterated in a 2010 Historic Structure Report. In September 2010, the NPS granted <a href="Wiss,_Janney,_Elstner_Associates,_Inc." title="wikilink">Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc.</a> a contract for a structural study that would "gather data about the condition of the Arch to enable experts to develop and implement the right long-term solutions."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn325" id="fnref325"><sup>325</sup></a></p>

<p>Stain samples were taken on the west face of the Arch on October 21, 2014, to determine the best way to clean it. The cleaning will cost about $340,000.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn326" id="fnref326"><sup>326</sup></a></p>
