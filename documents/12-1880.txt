   Carathéodory's existence theorem      Carathéodory's existence theorem   In mathematics , Carathéodory's existence theorem says that an ordinary differential equation has a solution under relatively mild conditions. It is a generalization of Peano's existence theorem . Peano's theorem requires that the right-hand side of the differential equation is continuous, while Carathéodory's theorem shows existence of solutions (in a more general sense) for some discontinuous equations. The theorem is named after Constantin Carathéodory .  Introduction  Consider the differential equation        y  ′    (  t  )    =   f   (  t  ,   y   (  t  )    )           superscript  y  normal-′   t     f   t    y  t       y^{\prime}(t)=f(t,y(t))\,   with initial condition        y   (   t  0   )    =   y  0    ,        y   subscript  t  0     subscript  y  0     y(t_{0})=y_{0},\,   where the function ƒ is defined on a rectangular domain of the form       R  =   {    (  t  ,  y  )   ∈   𝐑  ×    𝐑  n      :     |   t  -   t  0    |   ≤  a   ,    |   y  -   y  0    |   ≤  b    }    .      R   conditional-set     t  y     𝐑   superscript  𝐑  n      formulae-sequence        t   subscript  t  0     a         y   subscript  y  0     b       R=\{(t,y)\in\mathbf{R}\times\mathbf{R}^{n}\,:\,|t-t_{0}|\leq a,|y-y_{0}|\leq b\}.   Peano's existence theorem states that if ƒ is continuous , then the differential equation has at least one solution in a neighbourhood of the initial condition. 1  However, it is also possible to consider differential equations with a discontinuous right-hand side, like the equation          y  ′    (  t  )    =   H   (  t  )     ,    y   (  0  )    =  0    ,     formulae-sequence       superscript  y  normal-′   t     H  t        y  0   0     y^{\prime}(t)=H(t),\quad y(0)=0,   where H denotes the Heaviside function defined by       H   (  t  )    =   {      0  ,        if  t   ≤  0   ;        1  ,       if  t   >  0.             H  t    cases  0      if  t   0   1      if  t   0.      H(t)=\begin{cases}0,&\text{if }t\leq 0;\\
 1,&\text{if }t>0.\end{cases}   It makes sense to consider the ramp function       y   (  t  )    =    ∫  0  t    H   (  s  )   d  s    =   {      0  ,        if  t   ≤  0   ;        t  ,       if  t   >  0               y  t     superscript   subscript   0   t     H  s  normal-d  s          cases  0      if  t   0   t      if  t   0       y(t)=\int_{0}^{t}H(s)\,\mathrm{d}s=\begin{cases}0,&\text{if }t\leq 0;\\
 t,&\text{if }t>0\end{cases}   as a solution of the differential equation. Strictly speaking though, it does not satisfy the differential equation at    t  =  0      t  0    t=0   , because the function is not differentiable there. This suggests that the idea of a solution be extended to allow for solutions that are not everywhere differentiable, thus motivating the following definition.  A function y is called a solution in the extended sense of the differential equation     y  ′   =   f   (  t  ,  y  )         superscript  y  normal-′     f   t  y      y^{\prime}=f(t,y)   with initial condition     y   (   t  0   )    =   y  0         y   subscript  t  0     subscript  y  0     y(t_{0})=y_{0}   if y is absolutely continuous , y satisfies the differential equation almost everywhere and y satisfies the initial condition. 2 The absolute continuity of y implies that its derivative exists almost everywhere. 3  Statement of the theorem  Consider the differential equation          y  ′    (  t  )    =   f   (  t  ,   y   (  t  )    )     ,    y   (   t  0   )    =   y  0     ,     formulae-sequence       superscript  y  normal-′   t     f   t    y  t          y   subscript  t  0     subscript  y  0      y^{\prime}(t)=f(t,y(t)),\quad y(t_{0})=y_{0},\,   with   f   f   f   defined on the rectangular domain    R  =   {   (  t  ,  y  )   |     |   t  -   t  0    |   ≤  a   ,    |   y  -   y  0    |   ≤  b    }       R   conditional-set   t  y    formulae-sequence        t   subscript  t  0     a         y   subscript  y  0     b       R=\{(t,y)\,|\,|t-t_{0}|\leq a,|y-y_{0}|\leq b\}   . If the function   f   f   f   satisfies the following three conditions:       f   (  t  ,  y  )       f   t  y     f(t,y)   is continuous in   y   y   y   for each fixed   t   t   t   ,      f   (  t  ,  y  )       f   t  y     f(t,y)   is measurable in   t   t   t   for each fixed   y   y   y   ,  there is a Lebesgue-integrable function    m   (  t  )       m  t    m(t)   ,     |   t  -   t  0    |   ≤  a          t   subscript  t  0     a    |t-t_{0}|\leq a   , such that     |   f   (  t  ,  y  )    |   ≤   m   (  t  )            f   t  y       m  t     |f(t,y)|\leq m(t)   for all     (  t  ,  y  )   ∈  R       t  y   R    (t,y)\in R   ,   then the differential equation has a solution in the extended sense in a neighborhood of the initial condition. 4  Notes    References    .   .
