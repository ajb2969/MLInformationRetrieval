   Aleksandrov–Clark measure      Aleksandrov–Clark measure   In mathematics , Aleksandrov–Clark (AC) measures are specially constructed measures named after the two mathematicians , A. B. Aleksandrov and Douglas Clark , who discovered some of their deepest properties. The measures are also called either Aleksandrov measures, Clark measures, or occasionally spectral measures.  AC measures are used to extract information about self-maps of the unit disc , and have applications in a number of areas of complex analysis , most notably those related to operator theory . Systems of AC measures have also been constructed for higher dimensions, and for the half-plane .  Construction of the measures  The original construction of Clark relates to one-dimensional perturbations of compressed shift operators on subspaces of the Hardy space :        H  2    (  𝔻  ,  ℂ  )    .       superscript  H  2    𝔻  ℂ     H^{2}(\mathbb{D},\mathbb{C}).     By virtue of Beurling's theorem , any shift-invariant subspace of this space is of the form       θ   H  2    (  𝔻  ,  ℂ  )    ,      θ   superscript  H  2    𝔻  ℂ     \theta H^{2}(\mathbb{D},\mathbb{C}),     where   θ   θ   \theta   is an inner function . As such, any invariant subspace of the adjoint of the shift is of the form        K  θ   =    (   θ   H  2    (  𝔻  ,  ℂ  )    )   ⟂    .       subscript  K  θ    superscript    θ   superscript  H  2    𝔻  ℂ    perpendicular-to     K_{\theta}=\left(\theta H^{2}(\mathbb{D},\mathbb{C})\right)^{\perp}.     We now define    S  θ     subscript  S  θ    S_{\theta}   to be the shift operator compressed to    K  θ     subscript  K  θ    K_{\theta}   , that is        S  θ   =      P   K  θ    S   |    K  θ     .       subscript  S  θ    evaluated-at     subscript  P   subscript  K  θ    S    subscript  K  θ      S_{\theta}=P_{K_{\theta}}S|_{K_{\theta}}.     Clark noticed that all the one-dimensional perturbations of    S  θ     subscript  S  θ    S_{\theta}   , which were also unitary maps, were of the form         U  α    (  f  )    =     S  θ    (  f  )    +   α   ⟨  f  ,   θ  z   ⟩      ,         subscript  U  α   f        subscript  S  θ   f     α   f    θ  z        U_{\alpha}(f)=S_{\theta}(f)+\alpha\left\langle f,\frac{\theta}{z}\right\rangle,     and related each such map to a measure,    σ  α     subscript  σ  α    \sigma_{\alpha}   on the unit circle, via the Spectral theorem . This collection of measures, one for each   α   α   \alpha   on the unit circle     𝕋     𝕋    {}^{\mathbb{T}}   , is then called the collection of AC measures associated with   θ   θ   \theta   .  An alternative construction  The collection of measures may also be constructed for any analytic function (that is, not necessarily an inner function). Given an analytic self map,   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   , of the unit disc,     𝔻     𝔻    {}^{\mathbb{D}}   , we can construct a collection of functions,    u  α     subscript  u  α    u_{\alpha}   , given by         u  α    (  z  )    =   ℜ   (    α  +   φ   (  z  )      α  -   φ   (  z  )      )     ,         subscript  u  α   z         α    φ  z      α    φ  z        u_{\alpha}(z)=\Re\left(\frac{\alpha+\varphi(z)}{\alpha-\varphi(z)}\right),     one for each      α  ∈  𝕋        α  𝕋     {}^{\alpha\in\mathbb{T}}   . Each of these functions is positive and harmonic, so by Herglotz' Theorem each is the Poisson integral of some positive measure    μ  α     subscript  μ  α    \mu_{\alpha}   on     𝕋     𝕋    {}^{\mathbb{T}}   . This collection is the set of AC measures associated with   φ   φ   \varphi   . It can be shown that the two definitions coincide for inner functions.
