Amorpha-4,11-diene 12-monooxygenase

Amorpha-4,11-diene 12-monooxygenase (, CYP71AV1) is an enzyme with system name amorpha-4,11-diene,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (12-hydroxylating).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

amorpha-4,11-diene + 3 O2 + 3 NADPH + 3 H+

artemisinate + 3 NADP+ + 4 H2O (overall reaction)
 
(1a) amorpha-4,11-diene + O2 + NADPH + H+

artemisinic alcohol + NADP+ + H2O
 
(1b) artemisinic alcohol + O2 + NADPH + H+

artemisinic aldehyde + NADP+ + 2 H2O
 
(1c) artemisinic aldehyde + O2 + NADPH + H+

artemisinate + NADP+ + H2O
 

Amorpha-4,11-diene 12-monooxygenase is a heme-thiolate protein (P-450)
