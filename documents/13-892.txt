   Bonse's inequality      Bonse's inequality   In number theory , Bonse's inequality , named after H. Bonse, 1 relates the size of a primorial to the smallest prime that does not appear in its prime factorization . It states that if p 1 , ..., p n , p n +1 are the smallest n + 1 prime numbers and n ≥ 4, then         p  1   ⋯   p  n    >   p   n  +  1   2    .         subscript  p  1   normal-⋯   subscript  p  n     superscript   subscript  p    n  1    2     p_{1}\cdots p_{n}>p_{n+1}^{2}.\,     Notes  References      "  Category:Theorems about prime numbers  Category:Inequalities     ↩
