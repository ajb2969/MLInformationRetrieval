   Chalcone 4'-O-glucosyltransferase      Chalcone 4'-O-glucosyltransferase   Chalcone 4'-O-glucosyltransferase (, 4'CGT ) is an enzyme with system name UDP-alpha-D-glucose:2',4,4',6'-tetrahydroxychalcone 4'-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) UDP-alpha-D-glucose + 2',4,4',6'-tetrahydroxychalcone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 2',4,4',6'-tetrahydroxychalcone 4'-O-beta-D-glucoside  (2) UDP-alpha-D-glucose + 2',3,4,4',6'-pentahydroxychalcone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 2',3,4,4',6'-pentahydroxychalcone 4'-O-beta-D-glucoside   This enzyme is isolated from the plant Antirrhinum majus (snapdragon).
