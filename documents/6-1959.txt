   Lower convex envelope      Lower convex envelope   In mathematics , the lower convex envelope     f  ˘     normal-˘  f    \breve{f}   of a function    f   f   f   defined on an interval     [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   is defined at each point of the interval as the supremum of all convex functions that lie under that function, i.e.        f   (  x  )    =   sup   {   g   (  x  )    ∣    g  is convex and  g   ≤   f  over   [  a  ,  b  ]     }     .        f  x    supremum   conditional-set    g  x       g  is convex and  g     f  over   a  b         f(x)=\sup\{g(x)\mid g\text{ is convex and }g\leq f\text{ over }[a,b]\}.
