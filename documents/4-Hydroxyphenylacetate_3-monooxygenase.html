<p>This reaction is the first step in a pathway found in enteric bacteria such as <a href="Escherichia_coli" title="wikilink">Escherichia coli</a> and soil bacteria such as <a href="Pseudomonas_putida" title="wikilink">Pseudomonas putida</a> which degrades <a class="uri" href="4-hydroxyphenylacetate" title="wikilink">4-hydroxyphenylacetate</a> (4-HPA), allowing these bacteria to use 4-HPA and other aromatic compounds found in mammalian digestive tracts or in soil as a carbon source.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> While most known flavin monooxygenases use <a class="uri" href="NADH" title="wikilink">NADH</a> or <a class="uri" href="NADPH" title="wikilink">NADPH</a> as substrates (and use the flavins FAD or <a href="Flavin_mononucleotide" title="wikilink">FMN</a> as prosthetic groups <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>), this enzyme is part of a two-component system, in which a flavin oxidoreductase partner () regenerates FADH<sub>2</sub> by oxidizing NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup>. hpaB and hpaC, the 4-HPA oxygenase and reductase partner proteins (respectively) of <em>E. coli</em> strain W, were the first two-component flavin monoxygenase system identified.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> While known examples of this enzyme share a common catalytic mechanism and likely evolutionary origin, they differ with respect to regulation and ability to substitute FMNH<sub>2</sub> for FADH<sub>2</sub> as a substrate.</p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p> This enzyme is a tetramer which forms as a dimer of dimers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Sequence alignments of the <a href="Thermus_thermophilus" title="wikilink">Thermus thermophilus</a> and <em>E. coli</em> hpaB enzymes show structural similarity to each other and to the oxygenase components of other bacterial two-component monooxygenases for compounds such as phenol and chlorophenol.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Each monomer of this protein consists of an N-terminal <a href="Alpha_helix" title="wikilink">alpha-helical</a> domain, a middle <a href="beta_barrel" title="wikilink">beta barrel</a> domain, and a C-terminal "tail" helix. FADH<sub>2</sub> is bound by a groove between these domains; this binding event causes a loop in the middle domain to change position, preforming a binding site for 4-HPA. At this point, multiple residues act to stabilize catalytic intermediates by <a href="Hydrogen_bond" title="wikilink">hydrogen-bonding</a> to the peroxide bound to FAD, as well as to the hydroxyl group of 4-HPA's phenol moiety (stabilizing its dienone transition state - see <a href="4-hydroxyphenylacetate_3-monooxygenase#Mechanism" title="wikilink">Mechanism</a>). The loop which moves to form the 4-HPA binding site when FADH<sub>2</sub> binds provides catalytic specificity by hydrogen-bonding to 4-HPA's carboxylic acid moiety.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="mechanism">Mechanism</h2>

<p>While many flavin-dependent monooxygenases retain FMN or FAD in their active sites throughout their catalytic cycle,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> this enzyme binds FADH<sub>2</sub> at the start of its catalytic cycle and releases FAD at the end. After FADH<sub>2</sub> binds, dioxygen attacks it at the C4a carbon, leading to a C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate. 4-HPA then binds, and a conformational change sequesters the enzyme's active site from solution, preventing the oxygen from escaping as toxic <a href="hydrogen_peroxide" title="wikilink">hydrogen peroxide</a>. 4-HPA is then hydoxylated via a dienone intermediate and released as 3,4-DHPA; with the peroxide bond broken, C4a-hydroxyflavin releases the remaining oxygen atom by eliminating water and is released from the enzyme as FAD.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="biological-function">Biological Function</h2>

<p>To cope with the wide variety of phenolic compounds found in nature, bacterial pathways for degradation of aromatic compounds generally begin by channeling these diverse substrates towards a few common intermediates, which are then further degraded.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Pathways for catabolizing aromatic compounds generally begin by adding two hydroxyl groups to the benzene ring, most often on adjacent carbons. This product then undergoes ring cleavage to produce a linear molecule which is ultimately degraded to intermediates of central metabolism, such as <a class="uri" href="succinate" title="wikilink">succinate</a>, <a class="uri" href="pyruvate" title="wikilink">pyruvate</a>, and <a href="carbon_dioxide" title="wikilink">carbon dioxide</a>. In the case of 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, which only needs one hydroxyl group to be added, a monooxygenase is required.</p>

<p>Among common <em>E. coli</em> laboratory strains, the 4-HPA degradation pathway is not found in the commonly used K-12 strain, but it does appear in strains B, C, and W (the strain in which most research into the pathway has been done). Only strains containing this pathway are able to survive by metabolizing 4-HPA as the sole carbon source, showing that this pathway is required for <a class="uri" href="catabolism" title="wikilink">catabolism</a> of this compound, and likely for similar phenolic compounds as well.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="evolution">Evolution</h2>

<p>In addition to the exclusively FADH<sub>2</sub>-dependent monooxygenase found in species such as <em>E. coli</em> and <em>T. thermophilus</em>, a version of the enzyme which can use either reduced FAD or reduced FMN has been described in <a href="Acinetobacter_baumannii" title="wikilink">Acinetobacter baumannii</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Although these enzymes catalyze similar reactions and share a similar <a href="acyl-CoA_dehydrogenase" title="wikilink">acyl-CoA dehydrogenase</a> fold, the FMN-dependent enzyme is allosterically regulated by 4-HPA while the FADH<sub>2</sub>-dependent enzyme is likely regulated by a simpler kinetic mechanism, in which low concentrations of 4-HPA lead the enzyme to bind and sequester FADH<sub>2</sub> as part of the normal catalytic cycle, causing the free concentration of FADH<sub>2</sub> to drop until the flavin oxidoreductase's reaction is indirectly inhibited as well.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Along with other differences in regulation and substrate binding despite a shared fundamental catalytic mechanism,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> this has led to speculation that these enzymes collectively represent an example of <a href="convergent_evolution" title="wikilink">convergent evolution</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="potential-applications">Potential Applications</h2>

<p>In addition to 4-HPA, the enzyme has been reported to have activity on a number of other phenolic substrates.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <a href="Metabolic_engineering" title="wikilink">Metabolic engineers</a> have demonstrated that microbes expressing the <em>E. coli</em> enzyme can catalyze reactions such as hydroxylation of <a class="uri" href="tyrosine" title="wikilink">tyrosine</a> to <a class="uri" href="L-dopa" title="wikilink">L-dopa</a> <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and hydroxylation of the pharmacologically interesting <a href="phenylpropanoid" title="wikilink">phenylpropanoids</a> umbelliferone and <a class="uri" href="resveratrol" title="wikilink">resveratrol</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> However, these approaches are not currently used commercially.</p>
