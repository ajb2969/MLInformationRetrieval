Kronecker symbol

In number theory, the Kronecker symbol, written as 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 
 , is a generalization of the Jacobi symbol to all integers

 
 . It was introduced by .
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a non-zero integer, with prime factorization



where 
 
 
 
  is a unit (i.e., 
 
 
 
 
 ), and the 
 
 
 
  are primes. Let 
 
 
 
  be an integer. The Kronecker symbol 
 
 
 
  is defined by



For odd

 
 
 , the number 
 
 
 
  is simply the usual Legendre symbol. This leaves the case when 
 
 
 
 . We define 
 
 
 
  by



Since it extends the Jacobi symbol, the quantity 
 
 
 
  is simply 
 
 
 
  when 
 
 
 
 . When 
 
 
 
 , we define it by



Finally, we put



These extensions suffice to define the Kronecker symbol for all integer values 
 
 
 
 .
Some authors only define the Kronecker symbol for more restricted values; for example, 
 
 
 
  congruent to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 .
Properties
The Kronecker symbol shares many basic properties of the Jacobi symbol, under certain restrictions:



 
  if 
 
 
 
 , otherwise 
 
 
 
 .


 
  unless 
 
 
 
 
 , one of 
 
 
 
  is zero and the other one is negative.


 
  unless 
 
 
 
 , one of 
 
 
 
  is zero and the other one has odd part (definition below) congruent to 
 
 
 
 
 .
For 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
  whenever 
 
 
 
  If additionally 
 
 
 
  have the same sign, the same also holds for 
 
 
 
 
 .
For 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
  whenever 
 
 


Quadratic reciprocity
The Kronecker symbol also satisfies the following versions of quadratic reciprocity law.
For any nonzero integer 
 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  denote its odd part

 
  where 
 
 
 
  is odd (for 
 
 
 
 , we put 
 
 
 
 
 ). Then the following symmetric version of quadratic reciprocity holds for every pair of integers 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 :



where the 
 
 
 
  sign is equal to 
 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  and is equal to 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 .
There is also equivalent non-symmetric version of quadratic reciprocity that holds for every pair of integers 
 
 
 
  (not necessarily relatively prime):



For any integer 
 
 
 
  let 
 
 
 
 . Then we have another equivalent non-symmetric version that states



for every pair of integers 
 
 
 
 .
The supplementary laws generalize to the Kronecker symbol as well. These laws follow easily from each version of quadratic reciprocity law stated above (unlike with Legendre and Jacobi symbol where both the main law and the supplementary laws are needed to fully describe the quadratic reciprocity).
For any integer 
 
 
 
  we have


 
  and for any odd integer 
 
 
 
  it's



Connection to Dirichlet characters
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the map 
 
 
 
  is a real Dirichlet character of modulus 
 
 
 
  Conversely, every real Dirichlet character can be written in this form with 
 
 
 
 
  (for 
 
 
 
  it's 
 
 
 
 ).
In particular, primitive real Dirichlet characters 
 
 
 
  are in a 1â€“1 correspondence with quadratic fields

 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  is a nonzero square-free integer (we can include the case 
 
 
 
  to represent the principal character, even though it is not a proper quadratic field). The character 
 
 
 
  can be recovered from the field as the Artin symbol

 
 : that is, for a positive prime 
 
 
 
 , the value of 
 
 
 
 
  depends on the behaviour of the ideal 
 
 
 
  in the ring of integers

 
 :


 
  Then 
 
 
 
  equals the Kronecker symbol 
 
 
 
 
 , where


 
  is the discriminant of 
 
 
 
 . The conductor of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 .
Similarly, if 
 
 
 
 
 , the map 
 
 
 
  is a real Dirichlet character of modulus 
 
 
 
  However, not all real characters can be represented in this way, for example the character 
 
 
 
  cannot be written as 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
 
 . By the law of quadratic reciprocity, we have 
 
 
 
 . A character 
 
 
 
  can be represented as 
 
 
 
  if and only if its odd part 
 
 
 
 , in which case we can take 
 
 
 
 
 .
