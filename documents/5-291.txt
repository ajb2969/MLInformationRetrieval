Lotka's law
'''Lotka's law''',{{cite journal|author=Lotka, Alfred J.|year=1926|title=The frequency distribution of scientific productivity|journal=Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences|volume=16|issue=12|pages=317–324}} named after Alfred J. Lotka, is one of a variety of special applications of Zipf's law. It describes the frequency of publication by authors in any given field. It states that the number of authors making n contributions is about $1/n^{a}$ of those making one contribution, where a nearly always equals two. More plainly, the number of authors publishing a certain number of articles is a fixed ratio to the number of authors publishing a single article. As the number of articles published increases, authors producing that many publications become less frequent. There are 1/4 as many authors publishing two articles within a specified time period as there are single-publication authors, 1/9 as many publishing three articles, 1/16 as many publishing four articles, etc. Though the law itself covers many disciplines, the actual ratios involved (as a function of 'a') are very discipline-specific.
The general formula says:
$$X^n Y = C$$
or
$$Y = C / X^n, \,$$
where X is the number of publications, Y the relative frequency of authors with X publications, and n and $C$ are constants depending on the specific field ($n \approx 2$).
This law is believed to have applications in other fields, for example in the military for fighter pilot kills.
Example
Say 100 authors write one article each over a specific period, we assume for this table that C=1 and n=2:



Number of articles written
Number of authors writing that number of articles




10
100/102 = 1


9
100/92 ≈ 1 (1.23)


8
100/82 ≈ 2 (1.56)


7
100/72 ≈ 2 (2.04)


6
100/62 ≈ 3 (2.77)


5
100/52 = 4


4
100/42 ≈ 6 (6.25)


3
100/32 ≈ 11 (11.111...)


2
100/22 = 25

100

Graphical plot of the Lotka function described above, with C=1, n=2

That would be a total of 293 articles with 155 writers with an average of 1.9 articles for each writer.
This is an empirical observation rather than a necessary result. This form of the law is as originally published and is sometimes referred to as the "discrete Lotka power function".1
