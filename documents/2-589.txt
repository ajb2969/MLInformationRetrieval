   Equivalent rectangular bandwidth      Equivalent rectangular bandwidth   The equivalent rectangular bandwidth or ERB is a measure used in psychoacoustics , which gives an approximation to the bandwidths of the filters in human hearing , using the unrealistic but convenient simplification of modeling the filters as rectangular band-pass filters .  Approximations  For moderate sound levels and young listeners, the bandwidth of human auditory filters can be approximated by the polynomial equation:  where f is the center frequency of the filter in kHz and ERB( f ) is the bandwidth of the filter in Hz. The approximation is based on the results of a number of published simultaneous masking experiments and is valid from 0.1 to 6.5 kHz. 1  The above approximation was given in 1983 by Moore and Glasberg, 2 who in 1990 published another approximation: 3  where f is in kHz and ERB( f ) is in Hz. The approximation is applicable at moderate sound levels and for values of f between 0.1 and 10 kHz. 4  ERB-rate scale  The ERB-rate scale , or simply ERB scale , can be defined as a function ERBS( f ) which returns the number of equivalent rectangular bandwidths below the given frequency f . It can be constructed by solving the following differential system of equations:      {       ERBS   (  0  )    =  0            d  f    d  ERBS   (  f  )      =   ERB   (  f  )            cases      ERBS  0   0   otherwise        d  f     d  ERBS  f      ERB  f    otherwise    \begin{cases}\mathrm{ERBS}(0)=0\\
 \frac{df}{d\mathrm{ERBS}(f)}=\mathrm{ERB}(f)\\
 \end{cases}     The solution for ERBS( f ) is the integral of the reciprocal of ERB( f ) with the constant of integration set in such a way that ERBS(0) = 0. 5  Using the second order polynomial approximation () for ERB( f ) yields:       ERBS   (  f  )    =    11.17  ⋅   ln   (    f  +  0.312    f  +  14.675    )     +  43.0         ERBS  f      normal-⋅  11.17        f  0.312     f  14.675      43.0     \mathrm{ERBS}(f)=11.17\cdot\ln\left(\frac{f+0.312}{f+14.675}\right)+43.0    6  where f is in kHz. The VOICEBOX speech processing toolbox for MATLAB implements the conversion and its inverse as:       ERBS   (  f  )    =   11.17268  ⋅   ln   (   1  +    46.06538  ⋅  f    f  +  14678.49     )           ERBS  f    normal-⋅  11.17268      1     normal-⋅  46.06538  f     f  14678.49         \mathrm{ERBS}(f)=11.17268\cdot\ln\left(1+\frac{46.06538\cdot f}{f+14678.49}\right)    7      f  =    676170.4   47.06538  -   e    0.08950404  ⋅  ERBS    (  f  )       -  14678.49       f      676170.4    47.06538   superscript  e     normal-⋅  0.08950404  ERBS   f      14678.49     f=\frac{676170.4}{47.06538-e^{0.08950404\cdot\mathrm{ERBS}(f)}}-14678.49    8  where f is in Hz.  Using the linear approximation () for ERB( f ) yields:       ERBS   (  f  )    =    21.4  ⋅  l   o   g  10    (   1  +   0.00437  ⋅  f    )          ERBS  f      normal-⋅  21.4  l   o   subscript  g  10     1   normal-⋅  0.00437  f       \mathrm{ERBS}(f)=21.4\cdot log_{10}(1+0.00437\cdot f)    9  where f is in Hz.
