   Bondy's theorem      Bondy's theorem   In mathematics, Bondy's theorem is a bound on the number of elements needed to distinguish the sets in a family of sets from each other. It belongs to the field of combinatorics , and is named after John Adrian Bondy , who published it in 1972. 1  Statement  The theorem is as follows:   Let X be a set with n elements and let A 1 , A 2 , ..., A n be distinct subsets of X . Then there exists a subset S of X with n − 1 elements such that the sets A i ∩ S are all distinct.   In other words, if we have a 0-1 matrix with n rows and n columns such that each row is distinct, we can remove one column such that the rows of the resulting n × ( n − 1) matrix are distinct. 2 3  Example  Consider the 4 × 4 matrix      [     1    1    0    1      0    1    0    1      0    0    1    1      0    1    1    0     ]      1  1  0  1    0  1  0  1    0  0  1  1    0  1  1  0     \begin{bmatrix}1&1&0&1\\
 0&1&0&1\\
 0&0&1&1\\
 0&1&1&0\end{bmatrix}   where all rows are pairwise distinct. If we delete, for example, the first column, the resulting matrix      [     1    0    1      1    0    1      0    1    1      1    1    0     ]      1  0  1    1  0  1    0  1  1    1  1  0     \begin{bmatrix}1&0&1\\
 1&0&1\\
 0&1&1\\
 1&1&0\end{bmatrix}   no longer has this property: the first row is identical to the second row. Nevertheless, by Bondy's theorem we know that we can always find a column that can be deleted without introducing any identical rows. In this case, we can delete the third column: all rows of the 3 × 4 matrix      [     1    1    1      0    1    1      0    0    1      0    1    0     ]      1  1  1    0  1  1    0  0  1    0  1  0     \begin{bmatrix}1&1&1\\
 0&1&1\\
 0&0&1\\
 0&1&0\end{bmatrix}   are distinct. Another possibility would have been deleting the fourth column.  Learning theory application  From the perspective of computational learning theory , Bondy's theorem can be rephrased as follows: 4   Let C be a concept class over a finite domain X . Then there exists a subset S of X with the size at most | C | − 1 such that S is a witness set for every concept in C .   This implies that every finite concept class C has its teaching dimension bounded by | C | − 1.
