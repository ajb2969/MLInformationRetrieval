Hausdorff moment problem

In mathematics, the Hausdorff moment problem, named after Felix Hausdorff, asks for necessary and sufficient conditions that a given sequence { mn : n = 0, 1, 2, ... } be the sequence of moments



of some Borel measure μ supported on the closed unit interval [0, 1]. In the case m0 = 1, this is equivalent to the existence of a random variable X supported on [0, 1], such that E Xn = mn.
The essential difference between this and other well-known moment problems is that this is on a bounded interval, whereas in the Stieltjes moment problem one considers a half-line [0, ∞), and in the Hamburger moment problem one considers the whole line (−∞, ∞).
In 1921, Hausdorff showed that { mn : n = 0, 1, 2, ... } is such a moment sequence if and only if the sequence is completely monotonic, i.e., its difference sequences satisfy the equation



for all n,k ≥ 0. Here, Δ is the difference operator given by



The necessity of this condition is easily seen by the identity


 
  which is ≥ 0, being the integral of an almost sure non-negative function. For example, it is necessary to have
