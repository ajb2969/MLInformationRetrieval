   Divisor function      Divisor function   In mathematics , and specifically in number theory , a divisor function is an arithmetic function related to the divisors of an integer . When referred to as the divisor function, it counts the number of divisors of an integer . It appears in a number of remarkable identities, including relationships on the Riemann zeta function and the Eisenstein series of modular forms . Divisor functions were studied by Ramanujan , who gave a number of important congruences and identities ; these are treated separately in the article Ramanujan's sum .  A related function is the divisor summatory function , which, as the name implies, is a sum over the divisor function.  Definition  The sum of positive divisors function σ x ( n ), for a real or complex number x , is defined as the sum of the x th powers of the positive divisors of n . It can be expressed in sigma notation as         σ  x    (  n  )    =    ∑   d  |  n     d  x     ,         subscript  σ  x   n     subscript    fragments  d  normal-|  n     superscript  d  x      \sigma_{x}(n)=\sum_{d|n}d^{x}\,\!,     where    d  |  n     fragments  d  normal-|  n    {d|n}   is shorthand for " d  divides  n ". The notations d ( n ), ν( n ) and τ( n ) (for the German Teiler = divisors) are also used to denote σ 0 ( n ), or the number-of-divisors function 1 2 . When x is 1, the function is called the sigma function or sum-of-divisors function , 3 4 and the subscript is often omitted, so σ( n ) is equivalent to σ 1 ( n ) ().  The aliquot sum s(n) of n is the sum of the proper divisors (that is, the divisors excluding n itself, ), and equals σ 1 ( n ) − n ; the aliquot sequence of n is formed by repeatedly applying the aliquot sum function.  Example  For example, σ 0 (12) is the number of the divisors of 12:       σ  0    (  12  )        subscript  σ  0   12    \displaystyle\sigma_{0}(12)     while σ 1 (12) is the sum of all the divisors:       σ  1    (  12  )        subscript  σ  1   12    \displaystyle\sigma_{1}(12)     and the aliquot sum s(12) of proper divisors is:      s   (  12  )       s  12    \displaystyle s(12)     Table of values      n   Divisors   σ 0 ( n )   σ 1 ( n )   s ( n ) = σ 1 ( n ) − n   Comment       1   1   1   1   0   square number: σ 0 ( n ) is odd; power of 2: s( n ) = n − 1 ( almost-perfect )     2   1,2   2   3   1   Prime: σ 1 (n) = 1+n so s(n) =1     3   1,3   2   4   1   Prime: σ 1 (n) = 1+n so s(n) =1     4   1,2,4   3   7   3   square number: σ 0 ( n ) is odd; power of 2: s ( n ) = n − 1 (almost-perfect)     5   1,5   2   6   1   Prime: σ 1 (n) = 1+n so s(n) =1     6   1,2,3,6   4   12   6   first perfect number : s ( n ) = n     7   1,7   2   8   1   Prime: σ 1 (n) = 1+n so s(n) =1     8   1,2,4,8   4   15   7   power of 2: s ( n ) = n − 1 (almost-perfect)     9   1,3,9   3   13   4   square number: σ 0 ( n ) is odd     10   1,2,5,10   4   18   8      11   1,11   2   12   1   Prime: σ 1 (n) = 1+n so s(n) =1     12   1,2,3,4,6,12   6   28   16   first abundant number : s ( n ) > n     13   1,13   2   14   1   Prime: σ 1 (n) = 1+n so s(n) =1     14   1,2,7,14   4   24   10      15   1,3,5,15   4   24   9      16   1,2,4,8,16   5   31   15   square number: σ 0 ( n ) is odd; power of 2: s ( n ) = n − 1 (almost-perfect)     The cases    x  =  2      x  2    x=2   ,    x  =  3      x  3    x=3   and so on are tabulated in , , , , ,  ...  Properties  For a non-square integer, n , every divisor, d , of n is paired with divisor n / d of n and     σ  0    (  n  )        subscript  σ  0   n    \sigma_{0}(n)   is then even; for a square integer one divisor (namely    n      n    \sqrt{n}   ) is not paired with a distinct divisor and     σ  0    (  n  )        subscript  σ  0   n    \sigma_{0}(n)   is then odd. Similarly, the number σ ( n ) is odd if and only if n is a square.  For a prime number  p ,       σ  0    (  p  )        subscript  σ  0   p    \displaystyle\sigma_{0}(p)     because by definition, the factors of a prime number are 1 and itself. Also, where p n # denotes the primorial ,        σ  0    (    p  n   #   )    =    2  n           subscript  σ  0      subscript  p  n   normal-#     superscript  2  n     \sigma_{0}(p_{n}\#)=2^{n}\,     since n prime factors allow a sequence of binary selection (    p  i     subscript  p  i    p_{i}   or 1) from n terms for each proper divisor formed.  Clearly,    1  <    σ  0    (  n  )    <  n        1     subscript  σ  0   n        n     1<\sigma_{0}(n)   and σ( n ) > n for all n > 2.  The divisor function is multiplicative , but not completely multiplicative . The consequence of this is that, if we write      n  =    ∏   i  =  1   r    p  i   a  i         n    superscript   subscript  product    i  1    r    superscript   subscript  p  i    subscript  a  i       n=\prod_{i=1}^{r}p_{i}^{a_{i}}     where r = ω ( n ) is the number of distinct prime factors of n , p i is the i th prime factor, and a i is the maximum power of p i by which n is divisible , then we have        σ  x    (  n  )    =    ∏   i  =  1   r      p  i    (    a  i   +  1   )   x    -  1     p  i  x   -  1            subscript  σ  x   n     superscript   subscript  product    i  1    r        superscript   subscript  p  i        subscript  a  i   1   x    1      superscript   subscript  p  i   x   1       \sigma_{x}(n)=\prod_{i=1}^{r}\frac{p_{i}^{(a_{i}+1)x}-1}{p_{i}^{x}-1}     which is equivalent to the useful formula:         σ  x    (  n  )    =    ∏   i  =  1   r     ∑   j  =  0    a  i     p  i   j  x      =    ∏   i  =  1   r    (   1  +   p  i  x   +   p  i   2  x    +  ⋯  +   p  i    a  i   x     )     .           subscript  σ  x   n     superscript   subscript  product    i  1    r     superscript   subscript     j  0     subscript  a  i     superscript   subscript  p  i     j  x             superscript   subscript  product    i  1    r     1   superscript   subscript  p  i   x    superscript   subscript  p  i     2  x    normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  p  i      subscript  a  i   x         \sigma_{x}(n)=\prod_{i=1}^{r}\sum_{j=0}^{a_{i}}p_{i}^{jx}=\prod_{i=1}^{r}(1+p_%
 {i}^{x}+p_{i}^{2x}+\cdots+p_{i}^{a_{i}x}).     It follows (by setting x = 0) that d ( n ) is:         σ  0    (  n  )    =    ∏   i  =  1   r    (    a  i   +  1   )     .         subscript  σ  0   n     superscript   subscript  product    i  1    r      subscript  a  i   1      \sigma_{0}(n)=\prod_{i=1}^{r}(a_{i}+1).     For example, if n is 24, there are two prime factors ( p 1 is 2; p 2 is 3); noting that 24 is the product of 2 3 ×3 1 , a 1 is 3 and a 2 is 1. Thus we can calculate     σ  0    (  24  )        subscript  σ  0   24    \sigma_{0}(24)   as so:       σ  0    (  24  )        subscript  σ  0   24    \displaystyle\sigma_{0}(24)     The eight divisors counted by this formula are 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 12, and 24.  We also note s ( n ) = σ ( n ) − n . Here s ( n ) denotes the sum of the proper divisors of n , i.e. the divisors of n excluding n itself. This function is the one used to recognize perfect numbers which are the n for which s ( n ) = n . If s ( n ) > n then n is an abundant number and if s ( n ) n = 2^k, then      σ   (  n  )    =    2  ×   2  k    -  1   =    2  n   -  1    ,          σ  n       2   superscript  2  k    1            2  n   1      \sigma(n)=2\times 2^{k}-1=2n-1,   and s(n) = n - 1 , which makes n  almost-perfect .  As an example, for two distinct primes p and q with ''p n = pq. \,  Then        σ   (  n  )    =    (   p  +  1   )    (   q  +  1   )    =   n  +  1  +   (   p  +  q   )     ,          σ  n       p  1     q  1           n  1    p  q       \sigma(n)=(p+1)(q+1)=n+1+(p+q),\,           φ   (  n  )    =    (   p  -  1   )    (   q  -  1   )    =    n  +  1   -   (   p  +  q   )     ,          φ  n       p  1     q  1             n  1     p  q       \varphi(n)=(p-1)(q-1)=n+1-(p+q),\,   and        n  +  1   =    (    σ   (  n  )    +   φ   (  n  )     )   /  2    ,        n  1         σ  n     φ  n    2     n+1=(\sigma(n)+\varphi(n))/2,\,           p  +  q   =    (    σ   (  n  )    -   φ   (  n  )     )   /  2    ,        p  q         σ  n     φ  n    2     p+q=(\sigma(n)-\varphi(n))/2,\,   where φ ( n ) is Euler's totient function .  Then, the roots of:        (   x  -  p   )    (   x  -  q   )    =     x  2   -    (   p  +  q   )   x    +  n   =     x  2   -    [    (    σ   (  n  )    -   φ   (  n  )     )   /  2   ]   x    +   [     (    σ   (  n  )    +   φ   (  n  )     )   /  2   -  1   ]    =   0             x  p     x  q         superscript  x  2       p  q   x    n             superscript  x  2      delimited-[]        σ  n     φ  n    2    x     delimited-[]          σ  n     φ  n    2   1          0     (x-p)(x-q)=x^{2}-(p+q)x+n=x^{2}-[(\sigma(n)-\varphi(n))/2]x+[(\sigma(n)+%

 \varphi(n))/2-1]},\,          q  =     (    σ   (  n  )    -   φ   (  n  )     )   /  4   +      [    (    σ   (  n  )    -   φ   (  n  )     )   /  4   ]   2   -   [     (    σ   (  n  )    +   φ   (  n  )     )   /  2   -  1   ]       .      q          σ  n     φ  n    4        superscript   delimited-[]        σ  n     φ  n    4    2    delimited-[]          σ  n     φ  n    2   1         q=(\sigma(n)-\varphi(n))/4+\sqrt{[(\sigma(n)-\varphi(n))/4]^{2}-[(\sigma(n)+%
 \varphi(n))/2-1]}.\,     Also, knowing n and either σ ( n ) or φ ( n ) (or knowing p+q and either σ ( n ) or φ ( n )) allows us to easily find p and q .  In 1984, Roger Heath-Brown proved that        σ  0    (  n  )    =    σ  0    (   n  +  1   )           subscript  σ  0   n      subscript  σ  0     n  1      \sigma_{0}(n)=\sigma_{0}(n+1)     will occur infinitely often.  Series relations  Two Dirichlet series involving the divisor function are:         ∑   n  =  1   ∞      σ  a    (  n  )     n  s     =   ζ   (  s  )   ζ   (   s  -  a   )     ,        superscript   subscript     n  1           subscript  σ  a   n    superscript  n  s       ζ  s  ζ    s  a      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sigma_{a}(n)}{n^{s}}=\zeta(s)\zeta(s-a),     which for d ( n ) = σ 0 ( n ) gives         ∑   n  =  1   ∞     d   (  n  )     n  s     =    ζ  2    (  s  )     ,        superscript   subscript     n  1          d  n    superscript  n  s        superscript  ζ  2   s     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{d(n)}{n^{s}}=\zeta^{2}(s),     and         ∑   n  =  1   ∞      σ  a    (  n  )    σ  b    (  n  )     n  s     =    ζ   (  s  )   ζ   (   s  -  a   )   ζ   (   s  -  b   )   ζ   (   s  -  a  -  b   )     ζ   (    2  s   -  a  -  b   )      .        superscript   subscript     n  1           subscript  σ  a   n   subscript  σ  b   n    superscript  n  s         ζ  s  ζ    s  a   ζ    s  b   ζ    s  a  b      ζ      2  s   a  b       \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sigma_{a}(n)\sigma_{b}(n)}{n^{s}}=\frac{\zeta(s)%
 \zeta(s-a)\zeta(s-b)\zeta(s-a-b)}{\zeta(2s-a-b)}.     A Lambert series involving the divisor function is:        ∑   n  =  1   ∞     q  n    σ  a    (  n  )     =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞      n  a    q  n     1  -   q  n            superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript  q  n    subscript  σ  a   n      superscript   subscript     n  1           superscript  n  a    superscript  q  n      1   superscript  q  n        \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}q^{n}\sigma_{a}(n)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{n^{a}q^{n}}{1-q%
 ^{n}}     for arbitrary complex | q | ≤ 1 and a . This summation also appears as the Fourier series of the Eisenstein series and the invariants of the Weierstrass elliptic functions .  Approximate growth rate  In little-o notation , the divisor function satisfies the inequality (see page 296 of Apostol’s book 5 )         for all  ϵ   >  0   ,    d   (  n  )    =   o   (   n  ϵ   )      .     formulae-sequence      for all  ϵ   0       d  n     o   superscript  n  ϵ       \mbox{for all }\epsilon>0,\quad d(n)=o(n^{\epsilon}).   More precisely, Severin Wigert showed that        lim sup   n  →  ∞       log  d    (  n  )     log   n  /   log   log  n        =   log  2.         subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n           d   n       n      n          2.     \limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{\log d(n)}{\log n/\log\log n}=\log 2.   On the other hand, since there are infinitely many prime numbers ,        lim inf   n  →  ∞     d   (  n  )     =  2.        subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n       d  n    2.    \liminf_{n\to\infty}d(n)=2.     In Big-O notation , Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet showed that the average order of the divisor function satisfies the following inequality (see Theorem 3.3 of Apostol’s book 6 )         for all  x   ≥  1   ,     ∑   n  ≤  x     d   (  n  )     =    x   log  x    +    (    2  γ   -  1   )   x   +   O   (   x   )       ,     formulae-sequence      for all  x   1       subscript     n  x      d  n        x    x          2  γ   1   x     O    x        \mbox{for all }x\geq 1,\sum_{n\leq x}d(n)=x\log x+(2\gamma-1)x+O(\sqrt{x}),   where   γ   γ   \gamma   is Euler's gamma constant . Improving the bound    O   (   x   )       O    x     O(\sqrt{x})   in this formula is known as Dirichlet's divisor problem  The behaviour of the sigma function is irregular. The asymptotic growth rate of the sigma function can be expressed by:         lim sup   n  →  ∞      σ   (  n  )      n    log   log  n       =   e  γ    ,        subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n         σ  n     n      n        superscript  e  γ     \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\sigma(n)}{n\,\log\log n}=e^{\gamma},     where lim sup is the limit superior . This result is Grönwall 's theorem , published in 1913 . His proof uses Mertens' 3rd theorem , which says that         lim   n  →  ∞      1   log  n      ∏   p  ≤  n     p   p  -  1       =   e  γ    ,        subscript    normal-→  n         1    n      subscript  product    p  n      p    p  1        superscript  e  γ     \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{\log n}\prod_{p\leq n}\frac{p}{p-1}=e^{\gamma},     where p denotes a prime.  In 1915, Ramanujan proved that under the assumption of the Riemann hypothesis , the inequality:        σ    (  n  )    <    e  γ   n   log   log  n           σ  n      superscript  e  γ   n      n       \ \sigma(n)   (Robin's inequality) holds for all sufficiently large n . In 1984 Guy Robin proved that the inequality is true for all n ≥ 5,041 if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is true . This is Robin's theorem and the inequality became known after him. The largest known value that violates the inequality is n =5,040. If the Riemann hypothesis is true, there are no greater exceptions. If the hypothesis is false, then Robin showed there are an infinite number of values of n that violate the inequality, and it is known that the smallest such n ≥ 5,041 must be superabundant . It has been shown that the inequality holds for large odd and square-free integers, and that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the inequality just for n divisible by the fifth power of a prime .  A related bound was given by Jeffrey Lagarias in 2002, who proved that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that       σ   (  n  )    <    H  n   +    ln   (   H  n   )     e   H  n            σ  n      subscript  H  n        subscript  H  n     superscript  e   subscript  H  n        \sigma(n)   for every natural number  n > 1, where    H  n     subscript  H  n    H_{n}   is the n th harmonic number , .  Robin also proved, unconditionally, that the inequality        σ    (  n  )    <     e  γ   n   log   log  n     +     0.6483   n    log   log  n            σ  n        superscript  e  γ   n      n         0.6483  n       n        \ \sigma(n)   holds for all n ≥ 3.
