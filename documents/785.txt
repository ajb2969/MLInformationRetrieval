   Ricinine nitrilase      Ricinine nitrilase   In enzymology , a ricinine nitrilase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ricinine + 2 H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-carboxy-4-methoxy-N-methyl-2-pyridone + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ricinine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 3-carboxy-4-methoxy-N-methyl-2-pyridone and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in nitriles. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ricinine aminohydrolase . This enzyme participates in nitrogen metabolism .  References       "  Category:EC 3.5.5  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
