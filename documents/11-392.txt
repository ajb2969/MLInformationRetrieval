   Trimetaphosphatase      Trimetaphosphatase   In enzymology , a trimetaphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   trimetaphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   triphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are trimetaphosphate and H 2 O , whereas its product is triphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is trimetaphosphate hydrolase . This enzyme is also called inorganic trimetaphosphatase . This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism .
