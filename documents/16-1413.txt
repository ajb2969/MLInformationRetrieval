   Igusa group      Igusa group   In mathematics , an Igusa group or Igusa subgroup is a subgroup of the Siegel modular group defined by some congruence conditions. They were introduced by .  Definition  The symplectic group Sp 2 g ( Z ) consists of the matrices      (     A     B  ;       C     D  ;      )      A  B    C  D     \begin{pmatrix}A&B\\
 C&D\end{pmatrix}   such that AB t and CD t are symmetric, and ''AD t − CD t = I (the identity matrix).  The Igusa group Γ g ( n ,2 n ) = Γ n ,2 n consists of the matrices      (     A     B  ;       C     D  ;      )      A  B    C  D     \begin{pmatrix}A&B\\
 C&D\end{pmatrix}   in Sp 2 g ( Z ) such that B and C are congruent to 0 mod n , A and D are congruent to the identity matrix I mod n , and the diagonals of AB t and CD t are congruent to 0 mod 2 n . We have Γ g (2 n )⊆ Γ g ( n ,2 n ) ⊆ Γ g ( n ) where Γ g ( n ) is the subgroup of matrices conguent to the identity modulo n .  References     "  Category:Automorphic forms
