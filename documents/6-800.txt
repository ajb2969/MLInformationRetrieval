   Retarded time      Retarded time   In electromagnetism , electromagnetic waves in vacuum travel at the speed of light  c , according to Maxwell's Equations . The retarded time is the time when the field began to propagate from a point in a charge distribution to an observer. The term "retarded" is used in this context (and the literature) in the sense of propagation delays .  Retarded and advanced times  (Figure)  Position vectors r and r′ used in the calculation.   The calculation of the retarded time t r or t ′ is nothing more than a simple " speed-distance-time " calculation for EM fields.  If the EM field is radiated at position vector  r ′ (within the source charge distribution), and an observer at position r measures the EM field at time t , the time delay for the field to travel from the charge distribution to the observer is | r − r ′ |/ c , so subtracting this delay from the observer's time t gives the time when the field actually began to propagate - the retarded time, t ′ . 1 2       t  ′   =   t  -    |   𝐫  -   𝐫  ′    |   c         superscript  t  normal-′     t        𝐫   superscript  𝐫  normal-′     c      t^{\prime}=t-\frac{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}^{\prime}|}{c}     which can be rearranged to      c  =    |   𝐫  -   𝐫  ′    |    t  -   t  ′         c        𝐫   superscript  𝐫  normal-′       t   superscript  t  normal-′       c=\frac{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}^{\prime}|}{t-t^{\prime}}     showing how the positions and times correspond to source and observer.  Another related concept is the advanced time  t a , which takes the same mathematical form as above, but with a “+” instead of a “−”:       t  a   =   t  +    |   𝐫  -   𝐫  ′    |   c         subscript  t  a     t        𝐫   superscript  𝐫  normal-′     c      t_{a}=t+\frac{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}^{\prime}|}{c}     and is so-called since this is the time the field will advance from the present time t . Corresponding to retarded and advanced times are retarded and advanced potentials . 3  Application  Perhaps surprisingly - electromagnetic fields and forces acting on charges depend on their history, not their mutual separation. 4 The calculation of the electromagnetic fields at a present time includes integrals of charge density ρ( r ', t r ) and current density  J ( r ', t r ) using the retarded times and source positions. The quantity is prominent in electrodynamics , electromagnetic radiation theory, and in Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory , since the history of the charge distribution affects the fields at later times.
