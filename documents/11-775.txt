Peptide deformylase

In enzymology, a peptide deformylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

formyl-L-methionyl peptide + H2O 
 
 
 
  formate + methionyl peptide
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are formyl-L-methionyl peptide and H2O, whereas its two products are formate and methionyl peptide.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is formyl-L-methionyl peptide amidohydrolase.
