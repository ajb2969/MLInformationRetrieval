Schläfli symbol

 In geometry, the Schläfli symbol is a notation of the form {p,q,r,...} that defines regular polytopes and tessellations.
The Schläfli symbol is named after the 19th-century mathematician Ludwig Schläfli who made important contributions in geometry and other areas.
Description
The Schläfli symbol is a recursive description, starting with a p-sided regular polygon as {p}. For example, {3} is an equilateral triangle, {4} is a square and so on.
A regular polyhedron which has q regular p-sided polygon faces around each vertex is represented by {p,q}. For example, the cube has 3 squares around each vertex and is represented by {4,3}.
A regular 4-dimensional polytope, with r {p,q} regular polyhedral cells around each edge is represented by {p,q,r}, and so on.
Regular polytopes can have star polygon elements, like the pentagram, with symbol {5/2}, represented by the vertices of a pentagon but connected alternately.
A facet of a regular polytope {p,q,r,...,y,z} is {p,q,r,...,y}.
A regular polytope has a regular vertex figure. The vertex figure of a regular polytope {p,q,r,...y,z} is {q,r,...y,z}.
The Schläfli symbol can represent a finite convex polyhedron, an infinite tessellation of Euclidean space, or an infinite tessellation of hyperbolic space, depending on the angle defect of the construction. A positive angle defect allows the vertex figure to fold into a higher dimension and loops back into itself as a polytope. A zero angle defect will tessellate space of the same dimension as the facets. A negative angle defect can't exist in ordinary space, but can be constructed in hyperbolic space.
Usually, a facet or a vertex figure is assumed to be a finite polytope, but can sometimes be considered a tessellation itself.
A regular polytope also has a dual polytope, represented by the Schläfli symbol elements in reverse order. A self-dual regular polytope will have a symmetric Schläfli symbol.
Symmetry groups
A Schläfli symbol is closely related to reflection symmetry groups, also called Coxeter groups, given with the same indices, but square brackets instead [p,q,r,...]. Such groups are often named by the regular polytopes they generate. For example [3,3] is the Coxeter group for reflective tetrahedral symmetry, and [3,4] is reflective octahedral symmetry, and [3,5] is reflective icosahedral symmetry.
Regular polygons (plane)
 The Schläfli symbol of a regular polygon with p edges is {p}.
For example, a regular pentagon is represented by {5}.
See the convex regular polygon and nonconvex star polygon.
For example, {5/2} is the pentagram.
Regular polyhedra (3-space)
The Schläfli symbol of a regular polyhedron is {p,q} if its faces are p-gons, and each vertex is surrounded by q faces (the vertex figure is a q-gon).
For example {5,3} is the regular dodecahedron. It has pentagonal (5 edges) faces, and 3 pentagons around each vertex.
See the 5 convex Platonic solids, the 4 nonconvex Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra.
Schläfli symbols may also be defined for regular tessellations of Euclidean or hyperbolic space in a similar way.
For example, the hexagonal tiling is represented by {6,3}.
Regular polychora (4-space)
The Schläfli symbol of a regular 4-polytope is of the form {p,q,r}. Its (two-dimensional) faces are regular p-gons ({p}), the cells are regular polyhedra of type {p,q}, the vertex figures are regular polyhedra of type {q,r}, and the edge figures are regular r-gons (type {r}).
See the six convex regular and 10 nonconvex polychora.
For example, the 120-cell is represented by {5,3,3}. It is made of dodecahedron cells {5,3}, and has 3 cells around each edge.
There is also one regular tessellation of Euclidean 3-space: the cubic honeycomb, with a Schläfli symbol of {4,3,4}, made of cubic cells, and 4 cubes around each edge.
There are also 4 regular compact hyperbolic tessellations including {5,3,4}, the Hyperbolic small dodecahedral honeycomb, which fills space with dodecahedron cells.
Higher dimensions
For higher-dimensional polytopes, the Schläfli symbol is defined recursively as {p1, p2, ..., pn − 1} if the facets have Schläfli symbol {p1,p2, ..., pn − 2} and the vertex figures have Schläfli symbol {p2,p3, ..., pn − 1}.
Notice that a vertex figure of a facet of a polytope and a facet of a vertex figure of the same polytope are the same: {p2,p3, ..., pn − 2}.
There are only 3 regular polytopes in 5 dimensions and above: the simplex, {3,3,3,...,3}; the cross-polytope, {3,3, ..., 3,4}; and the hypercube, {4,3,3,...,3}. There are no non-convex regular polytopes above 4 dimensions.
Dual polytopes
If a polytope of dimension ≥ 2 has Schläfli symbol {p1,p2, ..., pn − 1} then its dual has Schläfli symbol {pn − 1, ..., p2,p1}.
If the sequence is palindromic, i.e. the same forwards and backwards, the polytope is self-dual. Every regular polytope in 2 dimensions (polygon) is self-dual.
Prismatic polytopes
Uniform prismatic polytopes can be defined and named as a Cartesian product of lower-dimensional regular polytopes:

In 2D, a rectangle is represented as { } × { }. (The symbol { } means a line segment.) Its Coxeter diagram is .
In 3D, a p-gonal prism is represented as { } × {p}. Its Coxeter diagram is .
In 4D, a uniform {p,q}-hedral prism as { } × {p,q}. Its Coxeter diagram is .
In 4D, a uniform p-q duoprism as {p} × {q}. Its Coxeter diagram is .

The prismatic duals, or bipyramids can also be represented as composite symbols, but with the addition operator, +.

In 2D, a rhombus, is represented as { } + { }. Its Coxeter diagram is .
In 3D, a p-gonal bipyramid, is represented as { } + {p}. Its Coxeter diagram is .
In 4D, a {p,q}-hedral bipyramid as { } + {p,q}. Its Coxeter diagram is .
In 4D, a p-q duopyramid as {p} + {q}. Its Coxeter diagram is .

Pyramids containing vertices on two parallel hyperplanes. These can be represented in a join operator, ∨. A point is represented ( ). Every pair of vertices between joined figures are connected by edges.
In 2D, an isosceles triangle can be represented as ( ) ∨ { } = ( ) ∨ [( ) ∨ ( )].
In 3D:

A digonal disphenoid can be represented as { } ∨ { } = [( ) ∨ ( )] ∨ [( ) ∨ ( )].
A p-gonal pyramids are represented as ( ) ∨ {p}.

In 4D:

A p-q-hedral pyramid as ( ) ∨ {p,q}.
A 5-cell as ( ) ∨ [( ) ∨ {3}] or [( ) ∨ ( )] ∨ {3} = { } ∨ {3}.
A square pyramidal pyramid as ( ) ∨ [( ) ∨ {4}] or [( ) ∨ ( )] ∨ {4} = { } ∨ {4}.

When mixing operators, the order of operations from highest to lowest is: ×, +, and ∨.
Extension of Schläfli symbols
Polygons and circle tilings
A truncated regular polygon doubles in sides. A regular polygon with even sides can be halfed. An altered even-sided regular 2n-gon generates a star figure compound, 2{n}.

Polyhedra and tilings
Coxeter expanded his usage of the Schläfli symbol to quasiregular polyhedra by adding a vertical dimension to the symbol. It was a starting point toward the more general Coxeter diagram. Norman Johnson simplified the notation for vertical symbols with an r prefix. The t-notation is the most general, and directly corresponds to the rings of the Coxeter diagram. Symbols have a corresponding alternation, replacing rings with holes in a Coxeter diagram and h prefix standing for half, construction limited by the requirement that neighboring branches must be even-ordered and cuts the symmetry order in half. A related operator, a for altered, is shown with two nested holes, represents a compound polyhedra with both alternated halves, retaining the original full symmetry. A snub is a half form of a truncation, and a holosnub is both halves of an alternated truncation.
