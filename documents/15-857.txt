2-Deoxy-scyllo-inosamine dehydrogenase (SAM-dependent)

2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine dehydrogenase (SAM-dependent) (, btrN (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine:S-adenosyl-L-methionine 1-oxidoreductase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine + S-adenosyl-L-methionine

 
  3-amino-2,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inosose + 5'-deoxyadenosine + L-methionine
 

This enzyme participates in the biosynthetic pathway of the aminoglycoside antibiotics of the butirosin family.
