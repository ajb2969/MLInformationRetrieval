<h1>Sports rating system</h1>
<hr/>

<p>A <strong>sports rating system</strong> is a system that analyzes the results of sports competitions to provide ratings for each team or player. Common systems include polls of expert voters, crowdsourcing non-expert voters, betting markets, and computer systems. Ratings, or <strong>power ratings</strong>, are numerical representations of competitive strength, often directly comparable so that the game outcome between any two teams can be predicted. <a href="Ranking" title="wikilink">Rankings</a>, or <strong>power rankings</strong>, can be directly provided (e.g., by asking people to rank teams), or can be derived by sorting each team's ratings and assigning an <a href="Ordinal_scale" title="wikilink">ordinal</a> rank to each team, so that the highest rated team earns the #1 rank. Rating systems provide an alternative to traditional sports <a class="uri" href="standings" title="wikilink">standings</a> which are based on win-loss-tie ratios.</p>

<p> In the United States, the biggest use of sports ratings systems is to rate <a href="National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association" title="wikilink">NCAA</a> college football teams in <a href="Division_I_(NCAA)" title="wikilink">Division I FBS</a>, choosing teams to play in the <a href="college_football_playoff" title="wikilink">college football playoff</a>. Sports ratings systems are also used to help determine the field for the NCAA <a href="College_basketball" title="wikilink">Men's and Women's Basketball</a> tournaments, men's professional <a class="uri" href="golf" title="wikilink">golf</a> tournaments, professional <a class="uri" href="tennis" title="wikilink">tennis</a> tournaments, and <a class="uri" href="NASCAR" title="wikilink">NASCAR</a>. They are often mentioned in discussions about the teams that could or should receive invitations to participate in certain contests, despite not earning the most direct entrance path (such as a league championship).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Computer rating systems can tend toward <a href="Objectivity_(science)" title="wikilink">objectivity</a>, without specific player, team, regional, or style bias. <a href="Ken_Massey" title="wikilink">Ken Massey</a> writes that an advantage of computer rating systems is that they can "objectively track all" 351 college basketball teams, while human polls "have limited value".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Computer ratings are verifiable and repeatable, and are comprehensive, requiring assessment of all selected criteria. By comparison, rating systems relying on human polls include inherent human subjectivity; this may or may not be an attractive property depending on system needs.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Sports ratings systems have been around for almost 80 years, when ratings were calculated on paper rather than by computer, as most are today. Some older computer systems still in use today include: <a href="Jeff_Sagarin" title="wikilink">Jeff Sagarin's</a> systems, the <em><a href="New_York_Times" title="wikilink">New York Times</a></em> system, and the <a href="Dunkel_Index" title="wikilink">Dunkel Index</a>, which dates back to 1929. Before the advent of the NCAA college football playoff, the <a href="Bowl_Championship_Series" title="wikilink">Bowl Championship Series</a> championship game participants were determined by a combination of expert polls and computer systems.</p>
<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>

<p>Sports ratings systems use a variety of methods for rating teams, but the most prevalent method is called a power rating. The power rating of a team is a calculation of the team's strength relative to other teams in the same league or division. The basic idea is to maximize the amount of <a href="transitive_relation" title="wikilink">transitive relations</a> in a given data set due to game outcomes. For example, if A defeats B and B defeats C, then one can safely say that A&gt;B&gt;C.</p>

<p>There are obvious problems with basing a system solely on wins and losses. For example, if C defeats A, then an <a href="Intransitivity" title="wikilink">intransitive</a> relation is established (A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; A) and a ranking violation will occur if this is the only data available. Scenarios such as this happen fairly regularly in sports—for example, in the <a href="2005_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season" title="wikilink">2005 NCAA Division I-A football season</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania_State_University" title="wikilink">Penn State</a> beat <a href="Ohio_State_University" title="wikilink">Ohio State</a>, Ohio State beat <a href="University_of_Michigan" title="wikilink">Michigan</a>, and Michigan beat Penn State. To address these logical breakdowns, rating systems usually consider other criteria such as the game's score and where the match was held (for example, to assess a <a href="home_field_advantage" title="wikilink">home field advantage</a>). In most cases though, each team plays a sufficient amount of other games during a given season, which lessens the overall effect of such violations.</p>

<p>From an <a class="uri" href="academic" title="wikilink">academic</a> perspective, the use of <a href="linear_algebra" title="wikilink">linear algebra</a> and <a class="uri" href="statistics" title="wikilink">statistics</a> are popular among many of the systems' authors to determine their ratings. Some academic work is published in forums like the <a href="MIT_Sloan_Sports_Analytics_Conference" title="wikilink">MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference</a>, others in traditional statistics, mathematics, psychology, and computer science journals.</p>

<p>If sufficient "inter-divisional" league play is not accomplished, teams in an isolated division may be artificially propped up or down in the overall ratings due to a lack of correlation to other teams in the overall league. This phenomenon is evident in systems that analyze historical college football seasons, such as when the top <a href="Ivy_League" title="wikilink">Ivy League</a> teams of the 1970s, like <a href="Dartmouth_College" title="wikilink">Dartmouth</a>, were calculated by some rating systems to be comparable with accomplished powerhouse teams of that era such as <a href="University_of_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Nebraska</a>, <a href="University_of_Southern_California" title="wikilink">USC</a>, and <a href="Ohio_State_University" title="wikilink">Ohio State</a>. This conflicts with the subjective opinion that claims that while good in their own right, they were not nearly as good as those top programs. However, this may be considered a "pro" by non-<a href="Bowl_Championship_Series" title="wikilink">BCS</a> teams in Division I-A college football who point out that ratings systems have proven that their top teams belong in the same strata as the BCS teams. This is evidenced by the 2004 <a href="University_of_Utah" title="wikilink">Utah</a> team that went undefeated in the regular season and earned a BCS bowl bid due to the bump in their overall BCS ratings via the computer ratings component. They went on to play and defeat the <a href="Big_East_Conference_(1979–2013)" title="wikilink">Big East Conference</a> champion <a href="University_of_Pittsburgh" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh</a> in the 2005 <a href="Fiesta_Bowl" title="wikilink">Fiesta Bowl</a> by a score of 35-7. A related example occurred during the 2006 <a href="NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship" title="wikilink">NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament</a> where <a href="George_Mason_University" title="wikilink">George Mason</a> were awarded an at-large tournament bid due to their regular season record and their <a href="Ratings_Percentage_Index" title="wikilink">RPI rating</a> and rode that opportunity all the way to the <a href="NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship" title="wikilink">Final Four</a>.</p>

<p>Goals of some rating systems differ from one another. For example, systems may be crafted to provide a perfect retrodictive analysis of the games played to-date, while others are predictive and give more weight to future trends rather than past results. This results in the potential for misinterpretation of rating system results by people unfamiliar with these goals; for example, a rating system designed to give accurate <a href="point_spread" title="wikilink">point spread</a> predictions for gamblers might be ill-suited for use in selecting teams most deserving to play in a championship game or tournament.</p>
<h2 id="rating-considerations">Rating considerations</h2>
<h3 id="home-advantage">Home advantage</h3>

<p>  When two teams of equal quality play, the team at home tends to win more often. The size of the effect changes based on the era of play, game type, season length, sport, even <a href="Circadian_advantage" title="wikilink">number of time zones crossed</a>. But across all conditions, "simply playing at home increases the chances of winning."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> A win away from home is therefore seen more favorably than a win at home, because it was more challenging. Home advantage (which, for sports played on a pitch, is almost always called "home field advantage") is also based on the qualities of the individual stadium and crowd; the advantage in the NFL can be more than a 4-point difference from the stadium with the least advantage to the stadium with the most.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="strength-of-schedule">Strength of schedule</h3>

<p>Strength of schedule refers to the quality of a team's opponents. A win against an inferior opponent is usually seen less favorably than a win against a superior opponent. Often teams in the same league, who are compared against each other for championship or playoff consideration, have not played the same opponents. Therefore judging their relative win-loss records is complicated. <mtpl></mtpl> The college football playoff committee uses a limited strength-of-schedule algorithm that only considers opponents' records and opponents' opponents' records<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> (much like <a href="Ratings_Percentage_Index" title="wikilink">RPI</a>).</p>
<h3 id="points-versus-wins">Points versus wins</h3>

<p>A key dichotomy among sports rating systems lies in the representation of game outcomes. Some systems store final scores as <a href="Three-valued_logic" title="wikilink">ternary</a> discrete events: wins, draws, and losses. Other systems record the exact final game score, then judge teams based on <a href="margin_of_victory" title="wikilink">margin of victory</a>. Rating teams based on margin of victory is often criticized as creating an incentive for coaches to run up the score, an "unsportsmanlike" outcome.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Still other systems choose a middle ground, reducing the <a href="marginal_value" title="wikilink">marginal value</a> of additional points as the margin of victory increases. Sagarin chose to clamp the margin of victory to a predetermined amount.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Other approaches include the use of a decay function, such as a <a class="uri" href="logarithm" title="wikilink">logarithm</a> or placement on a <a href="cumulative_distribution_function" title="wikilink">cumulative distribution function</a>.</p>
<h3 id="in-game-information">In-game information</h3>

<p>Beyond points or wins, some system designers choose to include more granular information about the game. Examples include time of possession of the ball, individual statistics, and lead changes. Data about weather, injuries, or "throw-away" games near season's end may affect game outcomes but are difficult to model. "Throw-away games" are games where teams have already earned playoff slots and have secured their playoff seeding before the end of the regular season, and want to rest/protect their starting players by benching them for remaining regular season games. This usually results in unpredictable outcomes and may skew the outcome of rating systems.</p>
<h3 id="team-composition">Team composition</h3>

<p>Teams often shift their composition between and within games, and players routinely get injured. Rating a team is often about rating a specific collection of players. Some systems assume <a href="parity_(sports)" title="wikilink">parity</a> among all members of the league, such as each team being built from an equitable pool of players via a <a href="Draft_(sports)" title="wikilink">draft</a> or <a href="free_agent" title="wikilink">free agency</a> system as is done in many major league sports such as the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">NFL</a>, <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">MLB</a>, <a href="National_Basketball_Association" title="wikilink">NBA</a>, and <a href="National_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">NHL</a>. This is certainly not the case in collegiate leagues such as Division I-A football or men's and women's basketball.</p>
<h3 id="cold-start">Cold start</h3>

<p>At the beginning of a season, there have been no games from which to judge teams' relative quality. Solutions to the cold start problem often include some measure of the previous season, perhaps weighted by what percent of the team is returning for the new season. <a href="ARGH_Power_Ratings" title="wikilink">ARGH Power Ratings</a> is an example of a system that uses multiple previous years plus a percentage weight of returning players.</p>
<h2 id="rating-methods">Rating methods</h2>
<h3 id="permutation-of-standings">Permutation of standings</h3>

<p>Several methods offer some permutation of traditional standings. This search for the "real" win-loss record often involves using other data, such as point differential or identity of opponents, to alter a team's record in a way that is easily understandable. Sportswriter <a href="Gregg_Easterbrook" title="wikilink">Gregg Easterbrook</a> created a measure of Authentic Games, which only considers games played against opponents deemed to be of sufficiently high quality.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The consensus is that all wins are not created equal. <mtpl></mtpl></p>
<h4 id="pythagorean">Pythagorean</h4>

<p>Pythagorean expectation, or Pythagorean projection, calculates a percentage based on the number of points a team has scored and allowed. Typically the formula involves the number of points scored, raised to some exponent, placed in the numerator. Then the number of points the team allowed, raised to the same exponent, is placed in the denominator and added to the value in the numerator. <a href="Football_Outsiders" title="wikilink">Football Outsiders</a> has used<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

 The resulting percentage is often compared to a team's true winning percentage, and a team is said to have "overachieved" or "underachieved" compared to the Pythagorean expectation. For example, <a href="Bill_Barnwell" title="wikilink">Bill Barnwell</a> calculated that before week 9 of the 2014 NFL season, the <a href="Arizona_Cardinals" title="wikilink">Arizona Cardinals</a> had a Pythagorean record two wins lower than their real record.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <a href="Bill_Simmons" title="wikilink">Bill Simmons</a> cites Barnwell's work before week 10 of that season and adds that "any numbers nerd is waving a “REGRESSION!!!!!” flag right now."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In this example, the Arizona Cardinals' regular season record was 8-1 going into the 10th week of the 2014 season. The Pythagorean win formula implied a winning percentage of 57.5%, based on 208 points scored and 183 points allowed. Multiplied by 9 games played, the Cardinals' Pythagorean expectation was 5.2 wins and 3.8 losses. The team had "overachieved" at that time by 2.8 wins, derived from their actual 8 wins less the expected 5.2 wins, an increase of 0.8 overachieved wins from just a week prior.</p>

<p>Originally designed by <a href="Arpad_Elo" title="wikilink">Arpad Elo</a> as a method for ranking chess players, several people have adapted the Elo rating system for team sports such as basketball, soccer and American football.
