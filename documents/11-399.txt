   Zn2+-exporting ATPase      Zn2+-exporting ATPase   In enzymology , a Zn2+-exporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O + Zn 2 +in   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + Zn 2 +out   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , H 2 O , and Zn 2+ , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and Zn 2+.  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (Zn2+-exporting) . Other names in common use include Zn(II)-translocating P-type ATPase , P1B-type ATPase , and AtHMA4 .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
