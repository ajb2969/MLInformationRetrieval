ATP-dependent NAD(P)H-hydrate dehydratase

In enzymology, an ATP-dependent NAD(P)H-hydrate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + (6S)-6-beta-hydroxy-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + NADH
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, (6S)-6-beta-hydroxy-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinamide-adenine, and dinucleotide, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and NADH.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (6S)-6-beta-hydroxy-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinamide-adenine-dinucleot ide hydro-lyase (ATP-hydrolysing; NADH-forming). Other names in common use include reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate dehydratase, ATP-dependent H4NAD(P)+OH dehydratase, (6S)-beta-6-hydroxy-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinamide-adenine-, and dinucleotide hydro-lyase(ATP-hydrolysing).
