Four-frequency




Four-frequency

The four-frequency of a photon is defined by



where 
 
 
 
  is the photon's frequency and 
 
 
 
  is a unit vector in the direction of the photon's motion. The four-frequency is always a future-pointing and null vector. An observer moving with four-velocity

 
  will observe a frequency



Where 
 
 
 
  is the Minkowski inner-product (+---)
Closely related to the four-frequency is the wave four-vector defined by



where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the speed of light and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the wavelength of the photon. The wave four-vector is more often used in practice than the four-frequency, but the two vectors are related (using 
 
 
 
 ) by
