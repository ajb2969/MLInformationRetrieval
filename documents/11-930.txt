   Homocitrate synthase      Homocitrate synthase   In enzymology , a homocitrate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + H 2 O + 2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (R)-2-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate + CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA , H 2 O , and 2-oxoglutarate , whereas its two products are (R)-2-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate and CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases that convert acyl groups into alkyl groups on transfer. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:2-oxoglutarate C-acetyltransferase (thioester-hydrolysing, carboxymethyl forming) . Other names in common use include 2-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate 2-oxoglutarate-lyase , (CoA-acetylating) , acetyl-coenzyme A:2-ketoglutarate C-acetyl transferase , and homocitrate synthetase . This enzyme participates in lysine biosynthesis and pyruvate metabolism .  References       "  Category:EC 2.3.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
