Primorial prime

In mathematics, primorial primes are prime numbers of the form pn# ± 1, where pn# is the primorial of pn (that is, the product of the first n primes). 1
According to this definition,

pn# − 1 is prime for n = 2, 3, 5, 6, 13, 24, ... 
 


pn# + 1 is prime for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, ... 
 

The first few primorial primes are

2, 3, 5, 7, 29, 31, 211, 2309, 2311, 30029, 200560490131, 304250263527209, 23768741896345550770650537601358309
 

, the largest known primorial prime is 1098133# − 1 (n = 85586) with 476,311 digits, found by the PrimeGrid project.2
Euclid's proof of the infinitude of the prime numbers is commonly misinterpreted as defining the primorial primes, in the following manner: 3

Assume that the first n consecutive primes including 2 are the only primes that exist. If either pn# + 1 or pn# − 1 is a primorial prime, it means that there are larger primes than the nth prime (if neither is a prime, that also proves the infinitude of primes, but less directly; note that each of these two numbers has a remainder of either p − 1 or 1 when divided by any of the first n primes, and hence cannot be a multiple of any of them).
