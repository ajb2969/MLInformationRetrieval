   Achilleol B synthase      Achilleol B synthase   Achilleol B synthase () is an enzyme with system name (3S)-2,3-epoxy-2,3-dihydrosqualene mutase (cyclizing, achilleol-B-forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (3S)-2,3-epoxy-2,3-dihydrosqualene   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   achilleol B   Achilleol B is probably formed by cleavage of the 8-14 and 9-10 bonds of (3S)-2,3-epoxy-2,3-dihydrosqualene.
