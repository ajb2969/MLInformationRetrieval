Topological conjugacy

In mathematics, two functions are said to be topologically conjugate to one another if there exists a homeomorphism that will conjugate the one into the other. Topological conjugacy is important in the study of iterated functions and more generally dynamical systems, since, if the dynamics of one iterated function can be solved, then those for any topologically conjugate function follow trivially.
To illustrate this directly: suppose that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are iterated functions, and there exists an 
 
 
 
  such that


 
  so that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are topologically conjugate. Then of course one must have


 
  and so the iterated systems are conjugate as well. Here, ○ denotes function composition.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be topological spaces, and let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be continuous functions. We say that 
 
 
 
  is topologically semiconjugate to 
 
 
 
  if there exists a continuous surjection

 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is a homeomorphism, we say that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are topologically conjugate and we call 
 
 
 
  a topological conjugation between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Similarly, a flow

 
  on 
 
 
 
  is topologically semiconjugate to a flow 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  if there is a continuous surjection 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for each 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is a homeomorphism, then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are topologically conjugate.
Examples

the logistic map and the tent map are topologically conjugate.1
the logistic map of unit height and the Bernoulli map are topologically conjugate. 

Discussion
Topological conjugation – unlike semiconjugation – defines an equivalence relation in the space of all continuous surjections of a topological space to itself, by declaring 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to be related if they are topologically conjugate. This equivalence relation is very useful in the theory of dynamical systems, since each class contains all functions which share the same dynamics from the topological viewpoint. For example, orbits of 
 
 
 
  are mapped to homeomorphic orbits of 
 
 
 
  through the conjugation. Writing 
 
 
 
  makes this fact evident
 
 
 
 . Speaking informally, topological conjugation is a “change of coordinates” in the topological sense.
However, the analogous definition for flows is somewhat restrictive. In fact, we are requiring the maps 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to be topologically conjugate for each 
 
 
 
 , which is requiring more than simply that orbits of 
 
 
 
  be mapped to orbits of 
 
 
 
  homeomorphically. This motivates the definition of topological equivalence, which also partitions the set of all flows in 
 
 
 
  into classes of flows sharing the same dynamics, again from the topological viewpoint.
Topological equivalence
We say that two flows 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are topologically equivalent, if there is a homeomorphism 
 
 
 
 , mapping orbits of 
 
 
 
  to orbits of 
 
 
 
  homeomorphically, and preserving orientation of the orbits. In other words, letting 
 
 
 
  denote an orbit, one has



for each 
 
 
 
 . In addition, one must line up the flow of time: for each 
 
 
 
 , there exists a 
 
 
 
  such that, if 
 
 
 
 , and if 
 
 
 
  is such that 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .
Overall, topological equivalence is a weaker equivalence criterion than topological conjugacy, as it does not require that the time term is mapped along with the orbits and their orientation. An example of a topologically equivalent but not topologically conjugate system would be the non-hyperbolic class of two dimensional systems of differential equations that have closed orbits. While the orbits can be transformed to each other to overlap in the spatial sense, the periods of such systems cannot be analogously matched, thus failing to satisfy the topological conjugacy criterion while satisfying the topological equivalence criterion.
Smooth and orbital equivalence
More equivalence criteria can be studied if the flows 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  arise from differential equations.
Two dynamical systems defined by the differential equations 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are said to be smoothly equivalent if there is a diffeomorphism

 
  such that


 
  In that case, the dynamical systems can be transformed into each other by the coordinate transformation 
 
 
 
 .
Two dynamical systems on the same state space, defined by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , are said to be orbitally equivalent if there is a positive function 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . Orbitally equivalent system differ only in the time parametrization.
Systems that are smoothly equivalent or orbitally equivalent are also topologically equivalent. However, the reverse is not true. For example, consider linear systems in two dimensions of the form 
 
 
 
 . If the matrix 
 
 
 
  has two positive real eigenvalues, the system has an unstable node; if the matrix has two complex eigenvalues with positive real part, the system has an unstable focus (or spiral). Nodes and foci are topologically equivalent but not smoothly or orbitally equivalent.2
Generalizations of dynamic topological conjugacy
There are two reported extensions of the concept of dynamic topological conjugacy:

Analogous systems defined as isomorphic dynamical systems
Adjoint dynamical systems defined via adjoint functors and natural equivalences in categorical dynamics.34
