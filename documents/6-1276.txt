   Degree of an algebraic variety      Degree of an algebraic variety   The degree of an algebraic variety in mathematics is defined, for a projective variety  V , by an elementary use of intersection theory .  Definition  For V embedded in a projective space  P n and defined over some algebraically closed field  K , the degree d of V is the number of points of intersection of V , defined over K , with a linear subspace  L in general position , when         d  i  m   (  V  )    +   d  i  m   (  L  )     =  n   .          d  i  m  V     d  i  m  L    n    dim(V)+dim(L)=n.     Here dim( V ) is the dimension of V , and the codimension of L will be equal to that dimension. The degree d is an extrinsic quantity, and not intrinsic as a property of V . For example the projective line has an (essentially unique) embedding of degree n in P n .  Properties  The degree of a hypersurface  F = 0 is the same as the total degree of the homogeneous polynomial  F defining it (granted, in case F has repeated factors, that intersection theory is used to count intersections with multiplicity , as in Bézout's theorem ).  Other approaches  For a more sophisticated approach, the linear system of divisors defining the embedding of V can be related to the line bundle or invertible sheaf defining the embedding by its space of sections. The tautological line bundle on P n pulls back to V . The degree determines the first Chern class . The degree can also be computed in the cohomology ring of P n , or Chow ring , with the class of a hyperplane intersecting the class of V an appropriate number of times.  Extending Bézout's theorem  The degree can be used to generalize Bézout's theorem in an expected way to intersections of n hypersurfaces in P n .  "  Category:Algebraic varieties
