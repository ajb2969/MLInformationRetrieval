   Interval boundary element method      Interval boundary element method   Interval boundary element method is classical boundary element method with the interval parameters. Boundary element method is based on the following integral equation  $c\cdot u=\int\limits_{\partial \Omega}\left(G\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} - \frac{\partial G}{\partial n}u\right)dS$  The exact interval solution on the boundary can be defined in the following way:  $\tilde{u}(x)=\{u(x,p):c(p)\cdot u(p)=\int\limits_{\partial \Omega}\left(G(p)\frac{\partial u(p)}{\partial n} - \frac{\partial G(p)}{\partial n}u(p)\right)dS, p\in\hat{p} \}$  In practice we are interested in the smallest interval which contain the exact solution set  $\hat{u}(x)=hull \ \tilde {u}(x)=hull \{u(x,p):c(p)\cdot u(p)=\int\limits_{\partial \Omega}\left(G(p)\frac{\partial u(p)}{\partial n} - \frac{\partial G(p)}{\partial n}u(p)\right)dS, p\in\hat{p} \}$  In similar way it is possible to calculate the interval solution inside the boundary $\Omega$ .
