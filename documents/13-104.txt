   Decision rule      Decision rule   In decision theory , a decision rule is a function which maps an observation to an appropriate action. Decision rules play an important role in the theory of statistics and economics , and are closely related to the concept of a strategy in game theory .  In order to evaluate the usefulness of a decision rule, it is necessary to have a loss function detailing the outcome of each action under different states.  Formal definition  Given an observable random variable X over the probability space     (  ùí≥  ,  Œ£  ,   P  Œ∏   )     ùí≥  normal-Œ£   subscript  P  Œ∏     \scriptstyle(\mathcal{X},\Sigma,P_{\theta})   , determined by a parameter Œ∏ ‚àà Œò , and a set A of possible actions, a (deterministic) decision rule is a function Œ¥ :   ùí≥   ùí≥   \scriptstyle\mathcal{X}   ‚Üí A .  Examples of decision rules   An estimator is a decision rule used for estimating a parameter. In this case the set of actions is the parameter space, and a loss function details the cost of the discrepancy between the true value of the parameter and the estimated value. For example, in a linear model with a single scalar parameter   Œ∏   Œ∏   \theta   , the domain of   Œ∏   Œ∏   \theta   may extend over   ‚Ñõ   ‚Ñõ   \mathcal{R}   (all real numbers). An associated decision rule for estimating   Œ∏   Œ∏   \theta   from some observed data might be, "choose the value of the   Œ∏   Œ∏   \theta   , say    Œ∏  ^     normal-^  Œ∏    \hat{\theta}   , that minimizes the sum of squared error between some observed responses and responses predicted from the corresponding covariates given that you chose    Œ∏  ^     normal-^  Œ∏    \hat{\theta}   ." Thus, the cost function is the sum of squared error, and one would aim to minimize this cost. Once the cost function is defined,    Œ∏  ^     normal-^  Œ∏    \hat{\theta}   could be chosen, for instance, using some optimization algorithm.
