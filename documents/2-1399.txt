Inverse Laplace transform

In mathematics, the inverse Laplace transform of a function F(s) is the piecewise-continuous and exponentially-restricted real function f(t) which has the property:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes the Laplace transform.
It can be proven, that if a function F(s) has the inverse Laplace transform f(t), then f(t) is uniquely determined (considering functions which differ from each other only on a point set having Lebesgue measure zero as the same). This result was first proven by Mathias Lerch in 1903 and is known as Lerch's theorem.12
The Laplace transform and the inverse Laplace transform together have a number of properties that make them useful for analysing linear dynamic systems.
Mellin's inverse formula
An integral formula for the inverse Laplace transform, called the Mellin's inverse formula, the Bromwich integral, or the Fourier–Mellin integral, is given by the line integral:


 
  where the integration is done along the vertical line Re(s) = γ in the complex plane such that γ is greater than the real part of all singularities of F(s). This ensures that the contour path is in the region of convergence. If all singularities are in the left half-plane, or F(s) is a smooth function on −∞
