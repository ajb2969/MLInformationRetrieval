   Inverse Laplace transform      Inverse Laplace transform   In mathematics , the inverse Laplace transform of a function F ( s ) is the piecewise-continuous and exponentially-restricted real function f ( t ) which has the property:        ℒ   {  f  }    (  s  )    =   ℒ   {   f   (  t  )    }    (  s  )    =   F   (  s  )     ,          ℒ   f   s     ℒ     f  t    s          F  s      \mathcal{L}\{f\}(s)=\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\}(s)=F(s),   where   ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   denotes the Laplace transform .  It can be proven, that if a function F ( s ) has the inverse Laplace transform f ( t ), then f ( t ) is uniquely determined (considering functions which differ from each other only on a point set having Lebesgue measure zero as the same). This result was first proven by Mathias Lerch in 1903 and is known as Lerch's theorem. 1 2  The Laplace transform and the inverse Laplace transform together have a number of properties that make them useful for analysing linear dynamic systems .  Mellin's inverse formula  An integral formula for the inverse Laplace transform , called the Mellin's inverse formula , the Bromwich integral , or the Fourier – Mellin integral , is given by the line integral :        f   (  t  )    =    ℒ   -  1     {  F  }    (  t  )    =    ℒ   -  1     {   F   (  s  )    }    (  t  )    =    1   2  π  i      lim   T  →  ∞      ∫   γ  -   i  T     γ  +   i  T       e   s  t    F   (  s  )   d  s       ,          f  t      superscript  ℒ    1     F   t           superscript  ℒ    1       F  s    t            1    2  π  i      subscript    normal-→  T       superscript   subscript     γ    i  T       γ    i  T        superscript  e    s  t    F  s  d  s         f(t)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}\{F\}(t)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}\{F(s)\}(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\lim%

This ensures that the contour path is in the region of convergence . If all singularities are in the left half-plane, or F ( s ) is a smooth function on −∞   ilaplace performs symbolic inverse transforms in MATLAB  Numerical Inversion of Laplace Transforms in Matlab   See also   Inverse Fourier transform  Post's inversion formula , an alternative formula for the inverse Laplace transform.
