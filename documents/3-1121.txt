   Subtangent      Subtangent   In geometry , the subtangent and related terms are certain line segments defined using the line tangent to a curve at a given point and the coordinate axes . The terms are somewhat archaic today but were in common use until the early part of the 20th century.  Definitions  Let P = ( x , y ) be a point on a given curve with A = ( x , 0) its projection onto the x -axis. Draw the tangent to the curve at P and let T be the point where this line intersects the x -axis. Then TA is defined to be the subtangent at P . Similarly, if normal to the curve at P intersects the x -axis at N then AN is called the subnormal . In this context, the lengths PT and PN are called the tangent and normal , not to be confused with the tangent line and the normal line which are also called the tangent and normal.  Equations  Let φ be the angle of inclination of the tangent with respect to the x -axis; this is also known as the tangential angle . Then        tan  φ   =    d  y    d  x    =    A  P    T  A    =    A  N    A  P     .          φ       d  y     d  x             A  P     T  A             A  N     A  P       \tan\varphi=\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{AP}{TA}=\frac{AN}{AP}.   So the subtangent is        y   cot  φ    =   y    d  y    d  x      ,        y    φ      y      d  y     d  x       y\cot\varphi=\frac{y}{\tfrac{dy}{dx}},   and the subnormal is        y   tan  φ    =   y    d  y    d  x      .        y    φ      y      d  y     d  x       y\tan\varphi=y\frac{dy}{dx}.   The normal is given by        y   sec  φ    =   y    1  +    (    d  y    d  x    )   2       ,        y    φ      y      1   superscript      d  y     d  x    2        y\sec\varphi=y\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{2}},   and the tangent is given by        y   csc  φ    =    y    d  y    d  x       1  +    (    d  y    d  x    )   2       .        y    φ        y      d  y     d  x         1   superscript      d  y     d  x    2        y\csc\varphi=\frac{y}{\tfrac{dy}{dx}}\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{2}}.     Polar definitions  Let P = ( r , θ) be a point on a given curve defined by polar coordinates and let O denote the origin. Draw a line through O which is perpendicular to OP and let T now be the point where this line intersects the tangent to the curve at P . Similarly, let N now be the point where the normal to the curve intersects the line. Then OT and ON are, respectively, called the polar subtangent and polar subnormal of the curve at P .  Polar equations  Let ψ be the angle between the tangent and the ray OP ; this is also known as the polar tangential angle. Then        tan  ψ   =   r    d  r    d  θ     =    O  P    O  N    =    O  T    O  P     .          ψ     r      d  r     d  θ              O  P     O  N             O  T     O  P       \tan\psi=\frac{r}{\tfrac{dr}{d\theta}}=\frac{OP}{ON}=\frac{OT}{OP}.   So the polar subtangent is        r   tan  ψ    =    r  2     d  r    d  θ      ,        r    ψ       superscript  r  2       d  r     d  θ       r\tan\psi=\frac{r^{2}}{\tfrac{dr}{d\theta}},   and the subnormal is        r   cot  ψ    =    d  r    d  θ     .        r    ψ        d  r     d  θ      r\cot\psi=\frac{dr}{d\theta}.
