   Duality gap      Duality gap   In optimization problems in applied mathematics , the duality gap is the difference between the primal and dual solutions . If    d  *     superscript  d     d^{*}   is the optimal dual value and    p  *     superscript  p     p^{*}   is the optimal primal value then the duality gap is equal to     p  *   -   d  *        superscript  p     superscript  d      p^{*}-d^{*}   . This value is always greater than or equal to 0 (for minimization problems). The duality gap is zero if and only if strong duality holds. Otherwise the gap is strictly positive and weak duality holds. 1  In general given two dual pairs  separated  locally convex spaces     (  X  ,   X  *   )     X   superscript  X      \left(X,X^{*}\right)   and    (  Y  ,   Y  *   )     Y   superscript  Y      \left(Y,Y^{*}\right)   . Then given the function    f  :   X  →   ℝ  ∪   {   +  ∞   }        normal-:  f   normal-→  X    ℝ            f:X\to\mathbb{R}\cup\{+\infty\}   , we can define the primal problem by        inf   x  ∈  X     f   (  x  )     .      subscript  infimum    x  X      f  x     \inf_{x\in X}f(x).\,   If there are constraint conditions, these can be built into the function   f   f   f   by letting    f  =   f  +   I  constraints        f    f   subscript  I  constraints      f=f+I_{\mathrm{constraints}}   where   I   I   I   is the indicator function . Then let    F  :    X  ×  Y   →   ℝ  ∪   {   +  ∞   }        normal-:  F   normal-→    X  Y     ℝ            F:X\times Y\to\mathbb{R}\cup\{+\infty\}   be a perturbation function such that     F   (  x  ,  0  )    =   f   (  x  )          F   x  0      f  x     F(x,0)=f(x)   . The duality gap is the difference given by        inf   x  ∈  X     [   F   (  x  ,  0  )    ]    -    sup    y  *   ∈   Y  *      [   -    F  *    (  0  ,   y  *   )     ]          subscript  infimum    x  X     delimited-[]    F   x  0        subscript  supremum     superscript  y     superscript  Y       delimited-[]       superscript  F     0   superscript  y           \inf_{x\in X}[F(x,0)]-\sup_{y^{*}\in Y^{*}}[-F^{*}(0,y^{*})]   where    F  *     superscript  F     F^{*}   is the convex conjugate in both variables. 2 3 4  In computational optimization , another "duality gap" is often reported, which is the difference in value between any dual solution and the value of a feasible but suboptimal iterate for the primal problem. This alternative "duality gap" quantifies the discrepancy between the value of a current feasible but suboptimal iterate for the primal problem and the value of the dual problem; the value of the dual problem is, under regularity conditions, equal to the value of the convex relaxation of the primal problem: The convex relaxation is the problem arising replacing a non-convex feasible set with its closed convex hull and with replacing a non-convex function with its convex closure , that is the function that has the epigraph that is the closed convex hull of the original primal objective function. 5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12 13  References  "  Category:Mathematical optimization  Category:Linear programming  Category:Convex optimization     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
