   Normal basis      Normal basis   In mathematics , a normal basis in field theory is a special kind of basis for Galois extensions of finite degree, characterised as forming a single orbit for the Galois group . The normal basis theorem states that any finite Galois extension of fields has a normal basis. In algebraic number theory the study of the more refined question of the existence of a normal integral basis is part of Galois module theory.  In the case of finite fields , this means that each of the basis elements is related to any one of them by applying the Frobenius  p -th power mapping repeatedly, where p is the characteristic of the field. Let GF( p m ) be a field with p m elements, and β an element of it such that the m elements      {  β  ,   β  p   ,   β   p  2    ,  …  ,   β   p   m  -  1     }     β   superscript  β  p    superscript  β   superscript  p  2    normal-…   superscript  β   superscript  p    m  1       \{\beta,\beta^{p},\beta^{p^{2}},\ldots,\beta^{p^{m-1}}\}     are linearly independent. Then this set forms a normal basis for GF( p m ) over GF( p ).  Usage  This basis is frequently used in cryptographic applications that are based on the discrete logarithm problem such as elliptic curve cryptography . Hardware implementations of normal basis arithmetic typically have far less power consumption than other bases.  When representing elements as a binary string (e.g. in GF(2 3 ) the most significant bit represents β 2 2 =  β 4 , the middle bit represents β 2 1 =β 2 , and the least significant bit represents β 2 0 =β), we can square elements by doing a left circular shift (left shifting β 4 would give β 8 , but since we are working in GF(2 3 ) this wraps around to β). This makes the normal basis especially attractive for cryptosystems that utilize frequent squaring.  Primitive normal basis  A primitive normal basis of an extension of finite fields E / F is a normal basis for E / F which is generated by a primitive element of E . Lenstra and Schoof (1987) proved that every finite field extension possesses a primitive normal basis, the case when F is a prime field having been settled by Harold Davenport .  Free elements  If E / F is a Galois extension with group G and x in E generates a normal basis then x is free in E / F . If x has the property that for every subgroup H of G , with fixed field H °, x is free for E / H °, then x is said to be completely free in E / F . Every Galois extension has a completely free element. 1  See also   Dual basis in a field extension  Polynomial basis  Zech's logarithms for reducing high-order polynomials to those within the field   References        "  Category:Linear algebra  Category:Field theory  Category:Abstract algebra  Category:Cryptography     Dirk Hachenberger, Completely free elements , in Cohen & Niederreiter (1996) pp.97-107 ↩
