   Zero-product property      Zero-product property   In algebra , the zero-product property states that the product of two nonzero elements is nonzero. In other words, it is the following assertion:   If     a  b   =  0        a  b   0    ab=0   , then    a  =  0      a  0    a=0   or    b  =  0      b  0    b=0   .   The zero-product property is also known as the rule of zero product , the null factor law or the nonexistence of nontrivial zero divisors . All of the number systems studied in elementary mathematics — the integers    ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   , the rational numbers    ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   , the real numbers    ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   , and the complex numbers    ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   — satisfy the zero-product property. In general, a ring which satisfies the zero-product property is called a domain .  Algebraic context  Suppose   A   A   A   is an algebraic structure. We might ask, does   A   A   A   have the zero-product property? In order for this question to have meaning,   A   A   A   must have both additive structure and multiplicative structure. 1 Usually one assumes that   A   A   A   is a ring , though it could be something else, e.g., the nonnegative integers    {  0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  …  }     0  1  2  normal-…    \{0,1,2,\ldots\}   .  Note that if   A   A   A   satisfies the zero-product property, and if   B   B   B   is a subset of   A   A   A   , then   B   B   B   also satisfies the zero product property: if   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   are elements of   B   B   B   such that     a  b   =  0        a  b   0    ab=0   , then either    a  =  0      a  0    a=0   or    b  =  0      b  0    b=0   because   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   can also be considered as elements of   A   A   A   .  Examples   A ring in which the zero-product property holds is called a domain . A commutative domain with a multiplicative identity element is called an integral domain . Any field is an integral domain; in fact, any subring of a field is an integral domain (as long as it contains 1). Similarly, any subring of a skew field is a domain. Thus, the zero-product property holds for any subring of a skew field.    If   p   p   p   is a prime number , then the ring of integers modulo   p   p   p    has the zero-product property (in fact, it is a field).    The Gaussian integers are an integral domain because they are a subring of the complex numbers.    In the strictly skew field of quaternions , the zero-product property holds. This ring is not an integral domain, because the multiplication is not commutative.    The set of nonnegative integers    {  0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  …  }     0  1  2  normal-…    \{0,1,2,\ldots\}   is not a ring, but it does satisfy the zero-product property.   Non-examples   Let    ℤ  n     subscript  ℤ  n    \mathbb{Z}_{n}   denote the ring of integers modulo   n   n   n    . Then    ℤ  6     subscript  ℤ  6    \mathbb{Z}_{6}   does not satisfy the zero product property: 2 and 3 are nonzero elements, yet     2  ⋅  3   ≡   0     (   mod  6   )         normal-⋅  2  3    annotated  0   pmod  6      2\cdot 3\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}6)   .    In general, if   n   n   n   is a composite number , then    ℤ  n     subscript  ℤ  n    \mathbb{Z}_{n}   does not satisfy the zero-product property. Namely, if    n  =   q  m       n    q  m     n=qm   where     0  <  q   ,   m  <  n      formulae-sequence    0  q     m  n     0   , then   m   m   m   and   q   q   q   are nonzero modulo   n   n   n   , yet     q  m   ≡   0     (   mod  n   )          q  m    annotated  0   pmod  n      qm\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}n)   .    The ring    ℤ   2  ×  2      superscript  ℤ    2  2     \mathbb{Z}^{2\times 2}   of 2 by 2 matrices with integer entries does not satisfy the zero-product property: if         M  =   (     1     -  1       0    0     )       M    1    1     0  0      M=\begin{pmatrix}1&-1\\
 0&0\end{pmatrix}   and    N  =   (     0    1      0    1     )       N    0  1    0  1      N=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\
 0&1\end{pmatrix}   ,      then          M  N   =    (     1     -  1       0    0     )    (     0    1      0    1     )    =   (     0    0      0    0     )   =  0          M  N       1    1     0  0      0  1    0  1            0  0    0  0         0     MN=\begin{pmatrix}1&-1\\
 0&0\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\
 0&1\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\
 0&0\end{pmatrix}=0   ,      yet neither   M   M   M   nor   N   N   N   is zero.    The ring of all functions     f  :    [  0  ,  1  ]   →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→   0  1   ℝ     f:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}   , from the unit interval to the real numbers , has nontrivial zero divisors: there are pairs of functions which are not identically equal to zero yet whose product is the zero function. In fact, it is not hard to construct, for any n ≥ 2, functions     f  1   ,  …  ,   f  n       subscript  f  1   normal-…   subscript  f  n     f_{1},\ldots,f_{n}   , none of which is identically zero, such that      f  i     f  j        subscript  f  i    subscript  f  j     f_{i}\,f_{j}   is identically zero whenever    i  ≠  j      i  j    i\neq j   .    The same is true even if we consider only continuous functions, or only even infinitely smooth functions.   Application to finding roots of polynomials  Suppose   P   P   P   and   Q   Q   Q   are univariate polynomials with real coefficients, and   x   x   x   is a real number such that     P   (  x  )   Q   (  x  )    =  0        P  x  Q  x   0    P(x)Q(x)=0   . (Actually, we may allow the coefficients and   x   x   x   to come from any integral domain.) By the zero-product property, it follows that either     P   (  x  )    =  0        P  x   0    P(x)=0   or     Q   (  x  )    =  0        Q  x   0    Q(x)=0   . In other words, the roots of    P  Q      P  Q    PQ   are precisely the roots of   P   P   P   together with the roots of   Q   Q   Q   .  Thus, one can use factorization to find the roots of a polynomial. For example, the polynomial      x  3   -   2   x  2    -   5  x    +  6         superscript  x  3     2   superscript  x  2      5  x    6    x^{3}-2x^{2}-5x+6   factorizes as     (   x  -  3   )    (   x  -  1   )    (   x  +  2   )         x  3     x  1     x  2     (x-3)(x-1)(x+2)   ; hence, its roots are precisely 3, 1, and -2.  In general, suppose   R   R   R   is an integral domain and   f   f   f   is a monic univariate polynomial of degree    d  ≥  1      d  1    d\geq 1   with coefficients in   R   R   R   . Suppose also that   f   f   f   has   d   d   d   distinct roots      r  1   ,  …  ,   r  d    ∈  R        subscript  r  1   normal-…   subscript  r  d    R    r_{1},\ldots,r_{d}\in R   . It follows (but we do not prove here) that   f   f   f   factorizes as     f   (  x  )    =    (   x  -   r  1    )   ⋯   (   x  -   r  d    )          f  x       x   subscript  r  1    normal-⋯    x   subscript  r  d       f(x)=(x-r_{1})\cdots(x-r_{d})   . By the zero-product property, it follows that     r  1   ,  …  ,   r  d       subscript  r  1   normal-…   subscript  r  d     r_{1},\ldots,r_{d}   are the only roots of   f   f   f   : any root of   f   f   f   must be a root of    (   x  -   r  i    )      x   subscript  r  i     (x-r_{i})   for some   i   i   i   . In particular,   f   f   f   has at most   d   d   d   distinct roots.  If however   R   R   R   is not an integral domain, then the conclusion need not hold. For example, the cubic polynomial     x  3   +   3   x  2    +   2  x        superscript  x  3     3   superscript  x  2      2  x     x^{3}+3x^{2}+2x   has six roots in    ℤ  6     subscript  ℤ  6    \mathbb{Z}_{6}   (though it has only three roots in   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   ).
