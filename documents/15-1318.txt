2-Polyprenyl-6-hydroxyphenyl methylase

2-polyprenyl-6-hydroxyphenyl methylase (, ubiG (gene), ubiG methyltransferase, 2-octaprenyl-6-hydroxyphenyl methylase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:3-(all-trans-polyprenyl)benzene-1,2-diol 2-O-methyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 3-(all-trans-polyprenyl)benzene-1,2-diol 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2-methoxy-6-(all-trans-polyprenyl)phenol
 

UbiG catalyses both methylation steps in ubiquinone biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.
