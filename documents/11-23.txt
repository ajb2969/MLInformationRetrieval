Valine decarboxylase

In enzymology, a valine decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-valine 
 
 
 
  2-methylpropanamine + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-valine, and two products, 2-methylpropanamine and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-valine carboxy-lyase (2-methylpropanamine-forming). Other names in common use include leucine decarboxylase, and L-valine carboxy-lyase. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
