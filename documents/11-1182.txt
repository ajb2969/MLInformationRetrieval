   NAD(P)(+)—protein-arginine ADP-ribosyltransferase      NAD(P)(+)—protein-arginine ADP-ribosyltransferase   In enzymology , a NAD(P)+-protein-arginine ADP-ribosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide   NAD + + protein L-arginine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   nicotinamide + Nomega-(ADP-D-ribosyl)-protein-L-arginine NADP + + protein L-arginine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   nicotinamide + Nomega-[(2'-phospho-ADP)-D-ribosyl]-protein-L-arginine   as well as the corresponding reaction using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate   NADP + + protein L-arginine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   nicotinamide + Nomega-(ADP-D-ribosyl)-protein-L-arginine NADP + + protein L-arginine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   nicotinamide + Nomega-[(2'-phospho-ADP)-D-ribosyl]-protein-L-arginine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are NAD + (or NADP + ) and protein L- arginine , whereas its two products are nicotinamide and Nomega-(ADP-D-ribosyl)-protein-L-arginine (or Nomega-[(2'-phospho-ADP)-D-ribosyl]-protein-L-arginine, respectively).  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is NAD(P)+:protein-L-arginine ADP-D-ribosyltransferase . Other names in common use include ADP-ribosyltransferase , mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferase , NAD+:L-arginine ADP-D-ribosyltransferase , NAD(P)+-arginine ADP-ribosyltransferase , and NAD(P)+:L-arginine ADP-D-ribosyltransferase .  At least five forms of the enzyme have been characterised to date, some of which are attached to the membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, while others appear to be secreted . The enzymes contain ~250-300 residues, which encode putative signal sequences and carbohydrate attachment sites. In addition, the N- and C-termini are predominantly hydrophobic, a characteristic of GPI-anchored proteins . 1  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
