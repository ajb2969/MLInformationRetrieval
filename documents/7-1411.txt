   Mountain pass theorem      Mountain pass theorem   The mountain pass theorem is an existence theorem from the calculus of variations . Given certain conditions on a function, the theorem demonstrates the existence of a saddle point . The theorem is unusual in that there are many other theorems regarding the existence of extrema , but few regarding saddle points.  Theorem statement  The assumptions of the theorem are:   I is a functional from a Hilbert space  H to the reals ,      I  ∈    C  1    (  H  ,  ℝ  )        I     superscript  C  1    H  ℝ      I\in C^{1}(H,\mathbb{R})   and    I  ′     superscript  I  normal-′    I^{\prime}   is Lipschitz continuous on bounded subsets of H ,  I satisfies the Palais-Smale compactness condition ,       I   [  0  ]    =  0        I   delimited-[]  0    0    I[0]=0   ,  there exist positive constants r and a such that     I   [  u  ]    ≥  a        I   delimited-[]  u    a    I[u]\geq a   if     ∥  u  ∥   =  r       norm  u   r    \|u\|=r   , and  there exists    v  ∈  H      v  H    v\in H   with     ∥  v  ∥   >  r       norm  v   r    \|v\|>r   such that     I   [  v  ]    ≤  0        I   delimited-[]  v    0    I[v]\leq 0   .   If we define:      Γ  =   {   𝐠  ∈   C   (   [  0  ,  1  ]   ;  H  )     |     𝐠   (  0  )    =  0   ,    𝐠   (  1  )    =  v    }       normal-Γ   conditional-set    𝐠    C    0  1   H      formulae-sequence      𝐠  0   0       𝐠  1   v       \Gamma=\{\mathbf{g}\in C([0,1];H)\,|\,\mathbf{g}(0)=0,\mathbf{g}(1)=v\}   and:       c  =    inf   𝐠  ∈  Γ       max   0  ≤  t  ≤  1    I    [   𝐠   (  t  )    ]      ,      c    subscript  infimum    𝐠  normal-Γ        subscript       0  t       1     I    delimited-[]    𝐠  t        c=\inf_{\mathbf{g}\in\Gamma}\max_{0\leq t\leq 1}I[\mathbf{g}(t)],   then the conclusion of the theorem is that c is a critical value of I .  Visualization  The intuition behind the theorem is in the name "mountain pass." Consider I as describing elevation. Then we know two low spots in the landscape: the origin because     I   [  0  ]    =  0        I   delimited-[]  0    0    I[0]=0   , and a far-off spot v where     I   [  v  ]    ≤  0        I   delimited-[]  v    0    I[v]\leq 0   . In between the two lies a range of mountains (at     ∥  u  ∥   =  r       norm  u   r    \|u\|=r   ) where the elevation is high (higher than a >0). In order to travel along a path g from the origin to v , we must pass over the mountains — that is, we must go up and then down. Since I is somewhat smooth, there must be a critical point somewhere in between. (Think along the lines of the mean-value theorem .) The mountain pass lies along the path that passes at the lowest elevation through the mountains. Note that this mountain pass is almost always a saddle point .  For a proof, see section 8.5 of Evans.  Weaker formulation  Let   X   X   X   be Banach space . The assumptions of the theorem are:       Φ  ∈   C   (  X  ,  𝐑  )        normal-Φ    C   X  𝐑      \Phi\in C(X,\mathbf{R})   and have a Gâteaux derivative      Φ  ′   :   X  →   X  *       normal-:   superscript  normal-Φ  normal-′    normal-→  X   superscript  X       \Phi^{\prime}\colon X\to X^{*}   which is continuous when   X   X   X   and    X  *     superscript  X     X^{*}   are endowed with strong topology and weak* topology respectively.  There exists    r  >  0      r  0    r>0   such that one can find certain     ∥   x  ′   ∥   >  r       norm   superscript  x  normal-′    r    \|x^{\prime}\|>r   with        max    (  Φ   (  0  )   ,  Φ   (   x  ′   )   )   <   inf    ∥  x  ∥   =  r    Φ   (  x  )   =  :  m   (  r  )      fragments    fragments  normal-(  Φ   fragments  normal-(  0  normal-)   normal-,  Φ   fragments  normal-(   superscript  x  normal-′   normal-)   normal-)     subscript  infimum     norm  x   r    Φ   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    normal-:  m   fragments  normal-(  r  normal-)     \max\,(\Phi(0),\Phi(x^{\prime}))<\inf\limits_{\|x\|=r}\Phi(x)=:m(r)   .      Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   satisfies weak Palais-Smale condition on    {   x  ∈  X   ∣    m   (  r  )    ≤   Φ   (  x  )     }     conditional-set    x  X       m  r     normal-Φ  x      \{x\in X\mid m(r)\leq\Phi(x)\}   .   In this case there is a critical point      x  ¯   ∈  X       normal-¯  x   X    \overline{x}\in X   of   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   satisfying     m   (  r  )    ≤   Φ   (   x  ¯   )          m  r     normal-Φ   normal-¯  x      m(r)\leq\Phi(\overline{x})   . Moreover if we define      Γ  =   {   c  ∈   C   (   [  0  ,  1  ]   ,  X  )     ∣      c    (  0  )    =  0   ,     c    (  1  )    =   x  ′     }       normal-Γ   conditional-set    c    C    0  1   X      formulae-sequence      c  0   0       c  1    superscript  x  normal-′        \Gamma=\{c\in C([0,1],X)\mid c\,(0)=0,\,c\,(1)=x^{\prime}\}   then        Φ   (   x  ¯   )    =    inf    c   ∈  Γ       max   0  ≤  t  ≤  1    Φ    (    c    (  t  )    )      .        normal-Φ   normal-¯  x      subscript  infimum    c  normal-Γ        subscript       0  t       1     normal-Φ     c  t       \Phi(\overline{x})=\inf_{c\,\in\,\Gamma}\max_{0\leq t\leq 1}\Phi(c\,(t)).
