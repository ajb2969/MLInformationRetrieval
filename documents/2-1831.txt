   Affine combination      Affine combination   In mathematics , an affine combination of vectors x 1 , ..., x n is a vector         ∑   i  =  1   n     α  i   ⋅   x  i     =     α  1    x  1    +    α  2    x  2    +  ⋯  +    α  n    x  n      ,        superscript   subscript     i  1    n    normal-⋅   subscript  α  i    subscript  x  i          subscript  α  1    subscript  x  1       subscript  α  2    subscript  x  2    normal-⋯     subscript  α  n    subscript  x  n       \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\alpha_{i}\cdot x_{i}}=\alpha_{1}x_{1}+\alpha_{2}x_{2}+\cdots+%
 \alpha_{n}x_{n},   called a linear combination of x 1 , ..., x n , in which the sum of the coefficients is 1, thus:        ∑   i  =  1   n    α  i    =  1.        superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  α  i    1.    \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\alpha_{i}}=1.     Here the vectors are elements of a given vector space  V over a field  K , and the coefficients    α  i     subscript  α  i    \alpha_{i}   are scalars in K .  This concept is important, for example, in Euclidean geometry .  The act of taking an affine combination commutes with any affine transformation  T in the sense that       T    ∑   i  =  1   n     α  i   ⋅   x  i      =    ∑   i  =  1   n      α  i   ⋅  T    x  i           T    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    normal-⋅   subscript  α  i    subscript  x  i        superscript   subscript     i  1    n      normal-⋅   subscript  α  i   T    subscript  x  i       T\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\alpha_{i}\cdot x_{i}}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\alpha_{i}\cdot Tx_{i}}   In particular, any affine combination of the fixed points of a given affine transformation    T   T   T   is also a fixed point of   T   T   T   , so the set of fixed points of   T   T   T   forms an affine subspace (in 3D: a line or a plane, and the trivial cases, a point or the whole space).  When a stochastic matrix , A, acts on a column vector, B, the result is a column vector whose entries are affine combinations of B with coefficients from the rows in A.
