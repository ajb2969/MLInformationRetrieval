<h1>Carl Friedrich Gauss</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss</strong> (; , ; ) (30 April 177723 February 1855) was a <a href="Germans" title="wikilink">German</a> <a class="uri" href="mathematician" title="wikilink">mathematician</a> who contributed significantly to many fields, including <a href="number_theory" title="wikilink">number theory</a>, <a class="uri" href="algebra" title="wikilink">algebra</a>, <a class="uri" href="statistics" title="wikilink">statistics</a>, <a href="mathematical_analysis" title="wikilink">analysis</a>, <a href="differential_geometry_and_topology" title="wikilink">differential geometry</a>, <a class="uri" href="geodesy" title="wikilink">geodesy</a>, <a class="uri" href="geophysics" title="wikilink">geophysics</a>, <a class="uri" href="mechanics" title="wikilink">mechanics</a>, <a class="uri" href="electrostatics" title="wikilink">electrostatics</a>, <a class="uri" href="astronomy" title="wikilink">astronomy</a>, <a href="matrix_theory" title="wikilink">matrix theory</a>, and <a class="uri" href="optics" title="wikilink">optics</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes referred to as the <em>Princeps mathematicorum</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (<a class="uri" href="Latin" title="wikilink">Latin</a>, "the Prince of Mathematicians" or "the foremost of mathematicians") and "greatest mathematician since antiquity", Gauss had an exceptional influence in many fields of mathematics and science and is ranked as one of history's most influential mathematicians.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-years">Early years</h2>

<p> Carl Friedrich Gauss was born on 30 April 1777 in <a href="Braunschweig" title="wikilink">Brunswick (Braunschweig)</a>, in the <a href="Duchy_of_Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel" title="wikilink">Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel</a> (now part of <a href="Lower_Saxony" title="wikilink">Lower Saxony</a>, <a class="uri" href="Germany" title="wikilink">Germany</a>), as the son of poor working-class parents.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> His mother was illiterate and never recorded the date of his birth, remembering only that he had been born on a Wednesday, eight days before the <a href="Ascension_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">Feast of the Ascension</a>, which itself occurs 40 days after <a class="uri" href="Easter" title="wikilink">Easter</a>. Gauss later solved this puzzle about his birthdate in the context of <a href="Computus" title="wikilink">finding the date of Easter</a>, deriving methods to compute the date in both past and future years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He was christened and <a href="Confirmation" title="wikilink">confirmed</a> in a church near the school he attended as a child.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Gauss was a <a href="child_prodigy" title="wikilink">child prodigy</a>. There are many anecdotes about his precocity while a toddler, and he made his first ground-breaking mathematical discoveries while still a teenager. He completed <em><a href="Disquisitiones_Arithmeticae" title="wikilink">Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</a></em>, his <a href="magnum_opus" title="wikilink">magnum opus</a>, in 1798 at the age of 21, though it was not published until 1801. This work was fundamental in consolidating number theory as a discipline and has shaped the field to the present day.</p>

<p>Gauss's intellectual abilities attracted the attention of the <a href="Charles_William_Ferdinand,_Duke_of_Brunswick" title="wikilink">Duke of Brunswick</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> who sent him to the Collegium Carolinum (now <a href="Braunschweig_University_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Braunschweig University of Technology</a>), which he attended from 1792 to 1795, and to the <a href="Georg-August_University_of_Göttingen" title="wikilink">University of Göttingen</a> from 1795 to 1798. While at university, Gauss independently rediscovered several important theorems.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> His breakthrough occurred in 1796 when he showed that a regular <a class="uri" href="polygon" title="wikilink">polygon</a> can be constructed by <a href="Compass_and_straightedge_constructions" title="wikilink">compass and straightedge</a> if and only if the number of sides is the product of distinct <a href="Fermat_number" title="wikilink">Fermat primes</a> and a <a href="exponentiation" title="wikilink">power</a> of 2. This was a major discovery in an important field of mathematics; construction problems had occupied mathematicians since the days of the <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">Ancient Greeks</a>, and the discovery ultimately led Gauss to choose mathematics instead of <a class="uri" href="philology" title="wikilink">philology</a> as a career. Gauss was so pleased by this result that he requested that a regular <a class="uri" href="heptadecagon" title="wikilink">heptadecagon</a> be inscribed on his tombstone. The <a href="stone_masonry" title="wikilink">stonemason</a> declined, stating that the difficult construction would essentially look like a circle.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>The year 1796 was most productive for both Gauss and number theory. He discovered a construction of the heptadecagon on 30 March.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> He further advanced <a href="modular_arithmetic" title="wikilink">modular arithmetic</a>, greatly simplifying manipulations in number theory. On 8 April he became the first to prove the <a href="quadratic_reciprocity" title="wikilink">quadratic reciprocity</a> law. This remarkably general law allows mathematicians to determine the solvability of any quadratic equation in modular arithmetic. The <a href="prime_number_theorem" title="wikilink">prime number theorem</a>, conjectured on 31 May, gives a good understanding of how the <a href="prime_number" title="wikilink">prime numbers</a> are distributed among the integers.</p>

<p>Gauss also discovered that every positive integer is representable as a sum of at most three <a href="triangular_number" title="wikilink">triangular numbers</a> on 10 July and then jotted down in <a href="Gauss's_diary" title="wikilink">his diary</a> the note: "<a href="Eureka_(word)" title="wikilink">ΕΥΡΗΚΑ</a>! num = Δ + Δ + Δ". On October 1 he published a result on the number of solutions of polynomials with coefficients in <a href="finite_field" title="wikilink">finite fields</a>, which 150 years later led to the <a href="Weil_conjectures" title="wikilink">Weil conjectures</a>.</p>

<h3 id="algebra">Algebra</h3>

<p> In his 1799 doctorate in absentia, <em>A new proof of the theorem that every integral rational algebraic function of one variable can be resolved into real factors of the first or second degree</em>, Gauss proved the <a href="fundamental_theorem_of_algebra" title="wikilink">fundamental theorem of algebra</a> which states that every non-constant single-variable <a class="uri" href="polynomial" title="wikilink">polynomial</a> with complex coefficients has at least one complex <a href="root_of_a_function" title="wikilink">root</a>. Mathematicians including <a href="Jean_le_Rond_d'Alembert" title="wikilink">Jean le Rond d'Alembert</a> had produced false proofs before him, and Gauss's dissertation contains a critique of d'Alembert's work. Ironically, by today's standard, Gauss's own attempt is not acceptable, owing to implicit use of the <a href="Jordan_curve_theorem" title="wikilink">Jordan curve theorem</a>. However, he subsequently produced three other proofs, the last one in 1849 being generally rigorous. His attempts clarified the concept of complex numbers considerably along the way.</p>

<p>Gauss also made important contributions to <a href="number_theory" title="wikilink">number theory</a> with his 1801 book <em><a href="Disquisitiones_Arithmeticae" title="wikilink">Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</a></em> (<a class="uri" href="Latin" title="wikilink">Latin</a>, Arithmetical Investigations), which, among other things, introduced the symbol ≡ for congruence and used it in a clean presentation of <a href="modular_arithmetic" title="wikilink">modular arithmetic</a>, contained the first two proofs of the law of <a href="quadratic_reciprocity" title="wikilink">quadratic reciprocity</a>, developed the theories of binary and ternary <a href="quadratic_form" title="wikilink">quadratic forms</a>, stated the <a href="class_number_problem" title="wikilink">class number problem</a> for them, and showed that a regular <a class="uri" href="heptadecagon" title="wikilink">heptadecagon</a> (17-sided polygon) can be <a href="Compass_and_straightedge_constructions" title="wikilink">constructed with straightedge and compass</a>.</p>

<p>In that same year, <a href="Italy" title="wikilink">Italian</a> astronomer <a href="Giuseppe_Piazzi" title="wikilink">Giuseppe Piazzi</a> discovered the <a href="dwarf_planet" title="wikilink">dwarf planet</a> <a href="Ceres_(dwarf_planet)" title="wikilink">Ceres</a>. Piazzi could only track Ceres for somewhat more than a month, following it for three degrees across the night sky. Then it disappeared temporarily behind the glare of the Sun. Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time were not able to extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data—three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit.</p>

<p>Gauss, who was 24 at the time, heard about the problem and tackled it. After three months of intense work, he predicted a position for Ceres in December 1801—just about a year after its first sighting—and this turned out to be accurate within a half-degree when it was rediscovered by <a href="Franz_Xaver_von_Zach" title="wikilink">Franz Xaver von Zach</a> on 31 December at <a href="Gotha_Observatory" title="wikilink">Gotha</a>, and one day later by <a href="Heinrich_Wilhelm_Matthäus_Olbers" title="wikilink">Heinrich Olbers</a> in <a class="uri" href="Bremen" title="wikilink">Bremen</a>.</p>

<p><a href="Gauss'_Method" title="wikilink">Gauss's method</a> involved determining a <a href="conic_section" title="wikilink">conic section</a> in space, given one focus (the Sun) and the conic's intersection with three given lines (lines of sight from the Earth, which is itself moving on an ellipse, to the planet) and given the time it takes the planet to traverse the arcs determined by these lines (from which the lengths of the arcs can be calculated by Kepler's Second Law). This problem leads to an equation of the eighth degree, of which one solution, the Earth's orbit, is known. The solution sought is then separated from the remaining six based on physical conditions. In this work Gauss used comprehensive approximation methods which he created for that purpose.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>One such method was the <a href="fast_Fourier_transform" title="wikilink">fast Fourier transform</a>. While this method is traditionally attributed to a 1965 paper by <a href="J._W._Cooley" title="wikilink">J. W. Cooley</a> and <a href="J._W._Tukey" title="wikilink">J. W. Tukey</a>, Gauss developed it as a trigonometric interpolation method. His paper, <em><a href="http://lseet.univ-tln.fr/~iaroslav/Gauss_Theoria_interpolationis_methodo_nova_tractata.php">Theoria Interpolationis Methodo Nova Tractata</a></em>, was only published posthumously in Volume 3 of his collected works. This paper predates the first presentation by <a href="Joseph_Fourier" title="wikilink">Joseph Fourier</a> on the subject in 1807.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>Zach noted that "without the intelligent work and calculations of Doctor Gauss we might not have found Ceres again". Though Gauss had up to that point been financially supported by his stipend from the Duke, he doubted the security of this arrangement, and also did not believe pure mathematics to be important enough to deserve support. Thus he sought a position in astronomy, and in 1807 was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Director of the astronomical <a href="Göttingen_Observatory" title="wikilink">observatory in Göttingen</a>, a post he held for the remainder of his life.</p>

<p>The discovery of Ceres led Gauss to his work on a theory of the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets, eventually published in 1809 as <em>Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum</em> (Theory of motion of the celestial bodies moving in conic sections around the Sun). In the process, he so streamlined the cumbersome mathematics of 18th century orbital prediction that his work remains a cornerstone of astronomical computation. It introduced the <a href="Gaussian_gravitational_constant" title="wikilink">Gaussian gravitational constant</a>, and contained an influential treatment of the <a href="Least_squares" title="wikilink">method of least squares</a>, a procedure used in all sciences to this day to minimize the impact of <a href="Observational_error" title="wikilink">measurement error</a>.</p>

<p> Gauss proved the method under the assumption of <a href="normal_distribution" title="wikilink">normally distributed</a> errors (see <a href="Gauss–Markov_theorem" title="wikilink">Gauss–Markov theorem</a>; see also <a href="List_of_topics_named_after_Carl_Friedrich_Gauss" title="wikilink">Gaussian</a>). The method had been described earlier by <a href="Adrien-Marie_Legendre" title="wikilink">Adrien-Marie Legendre</a> in 1805, but Gauss claimed that he had been using it since 1795.</p>
<h3 id="geodesic-survey">Geodesic survey</h3>

<p>In 1818 Gauss, putting his calculation skills to practical use, carried out a <a href="surveying" title="wikilink">geodesic survey</a> of the <a href="Kingdom_of_Hanover" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Hanover</a>, linking up with previous <a href="Denmark" title="wikilink">Danish</a> surveys. To aid the survey, Gauss invented the <a href="heliotrope_(instrument)" title="wikilink">heliotrope</a>, an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight over great distances, to measure positions.</p>
<h3 id="non-euclidean-geometries">Non-Euclidean geometries</h3>

<p>Gauss also claimed to have discovered the possibility of <a href="non-Euclidean_geometry" title="wikilink">non-Euclidean geometries</a> but never published it. This discovery was a major paradigm shift in mathematics, as it freed mathematicians from the mistaken belief that Euclid's axioms were the only way to make geometry consistent and non-contradictory.</p>

<p>Research on these geometries led to, among other things, <a href="Albert_Einstein" title="wikilink">Einstein</a>'s theory of general relativity, which describes the universe as non-Euclidean. His friend <a href="Farkas_Bolyai" title="wikilink">Farkas Wolfgang Bolyai</a> with whom Gauss had sworn "brotherhood and the banner of truth" as a student, had tried in vain for many years to prove the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms of geometry.</p>

<p>Bolyai's son, <a href="János_Bolyai" title="wikilink">János Bolyai</a>, discovered non-Euclidean geometry in 1829; his work was published in 1832. After seeing it, Gauss wrote to Farkas Bolyai: <em>"To praise it would amount to praising myself. For the entire content of the work ... coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past thirty or thirty-five years."</em></p>

<p>This unproved statement put a strain on his relationship with János Bolyai (who thought that Gauss was "stealing" his idea),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> but it is now generally taken at face value.</p>

<p>Letters from Gauss years before 1829 reveal him obscurely discussing the problem of parallel lines. <a href="G._Waldo_Dunnington" title="wikilink">Waldo Dunnington</a>, a biographer of Gauss, argues in <em>Gauss, Titan of Science</em> that Gauss was in fact in full possession of non-Euclidean geometry long before it was published by <a href="János_Bolyai" title="wikilink">János Bolyai</a>, but that he refused to publish any of it because of his fear of controversy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="theorema-egregium">Theorema Egregium</h3>

<p>The geodetic survey of Hanover, which required Gauss to spend summers traveling on horseback for a decade,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> fueled Gauss's interest in <a href="differential_geometry" title="wikilink">differential geometry</a> and <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a>, fields of mathematics dealing with <a href="curve" title="wikilink">curves</a> and <a href="surface" title="wikilink">surfaces</a>. Among other things he came up with the notion of <a href="Gaussian_curvature" title="wikilink">Gaussian curvature</a>. This led in 1828 to an important theorem, the <a href="Theorema_Egregium" title="wikilink">Theorema Egregium</a> (<em>remarkable theorem</em>), establishing an important property of the notion of <a class="uri" href="curvature" title="wikilink">curvature</a>. Informally, the theorem says that the curvature of a surface can be determined entirely by measuring <a href="angle" title="wikilink">angles</a> and <a href="distance" title="wikilink">distances</a> on the surface.</p>

<p>That is, curvature does not depend on how the surface might be <a href="embedding" title="wikilink">embedded</a> in 3-dimensional space or 2-dimensional space.</p>

<p>In 1821, he was made a foreign member of the <a href="Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences" title="wikilink">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a>.</p>
<h2 id="later-years-and-death">Later years and death</h2>

<p>  In 1831 Gauss developed a fruitful collaboration with the physics professor <a href="Wilhelm_Eduard_Weber" title="wikilink">Wilhelm Weber</a>, leading to new knowledge in <a class="uri" href="magnetism" title="wikilink">magnetism</a> (including finding a representation for the unit of magnetism in terms of mass, charge, and time) and the discovery of <a href="Kirchhoff's_circuit_laws" title="wikilink">Kirchhoff's circuit laws</a> in electricity. It was during this time that he formulated his namesake <a href="Gauss's_law" title="wikilink">law</a>. They constructed the first <a href="Electrical_telegraph" title="wikilink">electromechanical telegraph</a> in 1833, which connected the observatory with the institute for physics in Göttingen. Gauss ordered a magnetic <a class="uri" href="observatory" title="wikilink">observatory</a> to be built in the garden of the observatory, and with Weber founded the "Magnetischer Verein" (<em>magnetic club</em> in <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German</a>), which supported measurements of Earth's magnetic field in many regions of the world. He developed a method of measuring the horizontal intensity of the magnetic field which was in use well into the second half of the 20th century, and worked out the mathematical theory for separating the inner and outer (<a href="magnetosphere" title="wikilink">magnetospheric</a>) sources of Earth's magnetic field.</p>

<p>In 1840, Gauss published his influential <em>Dioptrische Untersuchungen</em>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> in which he gave the first systematic analysis on the formation of images under a <a href="paraxial_approximation" title="wikilink">paraxial approximation</a> (<a href="Gaussian_optics" title="wikilink">Gaussian optics</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Among his results, Gauss showed that under a paraxial approximation an optical system can be characterized by its <a href="Cardinal_point_(optics)" title="wikilink">cardinal points</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and he derived the Gaussian lens formula.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1845 he became associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, when that became the <a href="Royal_Netherlands_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences" title="wikilink">Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences</a> in 1851 he joined as foreign member.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1854, Gauss selected the topic for <a href="Bernhard_Riemann" title="wikilink">Bernhard Riemann</a>'s Habilitationvortrag, <em>Über die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> On the way home from Riemann's lecture, Weber reported that Gauss was full of praise and excitement.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>Gauss died in Göttingen, in the <a href="Kingdom_of_Hanover" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Hanover</a> (now part of <a href="Lower_Saxony" title="wikilink">Lower Saxony</a>, Germany) on 23 February 1855<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and is interred in the <a class="uri" href="Albanifriedhof" title="wikilink">Albanifriedhof</a> cemetery there. Two individuals gave eulogies at his funeral: Gauss's son-in-law <a href="Heinrich_Ewald" title="wikilink">Heinrich Ewald</a> and <a href="Wolfgang_Sartorius_von_Waltershausen" title="wikilink">Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen</a>, who was Gauss's close friend and biographer. His brain was preserved and was studied by <a href="Rudolf_Wagner" title="wikilink">Rudolf Wagner</a> who found its mass to be 1,492 grams (slightly above average) and the cerebral area equal to 219,588 square millimeters<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> (340.362 square inches). Highly developed convolutions were also found, which in the early 20th century was suggested as the explanation of his genius.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="religious-views">Religious views</h2>

<p>Gauss biographer <a href="G._Waldo_Dunnington" title="wikilink">G. Waldo Dunnington</a> describes Gauss's religious views in these terms:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>For him science was the means of exposing the immortal nucleus of the human soul. In the days of his full strength it furnished him recreation and, by the prospects which it opened up to him, gave consolation. Toward the end of his life it brought him confidence. Gauss' God was not a cold and distant figment of metaphysics, nor a distorted caricature of embittered theology. To man is not vouchsafed that fullness of knowledge which would warrant his arrogantly holding that his blurred vision is the full light and that there can be none other which might report truth as does his. For Gauss, not he who mumbles his creed, but he who lives it, is accepted. He believed that a life worthily spent here on earth is the best, the only, preparation for heaven. Religion is not a question of literature, but of life. God's revelation is continuous, not contained in tablets of stone or sacred parchment. A book is inspired when it inspires. The unshakeable idea of personal continuance after death, the firm belief in a last regulator of things, in an eternal, just, omniscient, omnipotent God, formed the basis of his religious life, which harmonized completely with his scientific research.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from his correspondence, there are not many known details about Gauss' personal creed. Many biographers of Gauss disagree with his religious stance, with Bühler and others who considered him a <a href="deism" title="wikilink">deist</a> with very unorthodox impressions,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> while Dunnington (though admits while Gauss didn't believe literally in all Christian dogmas and it's unknown if he believe in most doctrinal and confessional questions) points out that he was, at least, a nominal <a class="uri" href="Lutheran" title="wikilink">Lutheran</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>In connection to this, there's a record of a conversation between <a href="Rudolf_Wagner" title="wikilink">Rudolf Wagner</a> and Gauss, in which they discussed <a href="William_Whewell" title="wikilink">William Whewell</a>'s book <em>Of the Plurality of Worlds</em>. In this work, Whewell had discarded the possibility of existing life in other planets, on the basis of theological arguments, but this was a position with which both Wagner and Gauss disagreed. Later Wagner explained that he did not fully believe in the <a class="uri" href="Bible" title="wikilink">Bible</a>, though he confessed that he "envied" those who were able to easily believe.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> This later led them to discuss the topic of <a class="uri" href="faith" title="wikilink">faith</a>, and in some other religious remarks, Gauss said that he had been more influenced by theologians like <a href="Paul_Gerhardt" title="wikilink">Paul Gerhardt</a>, than by <a class="uri" href="Moses" title="wikilink">Moses</a>;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Other of his religious influences included Wilhelm Braubach, <a href="Johann_Peter_Süssmilch" title="wikilink">Johann Peter Süssmilch</a>, and the <a href="New_Testament" title="wikilink">New Testament</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>Dunnington further elaborates on Gauss's religious views by writing:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Gauss' religious consciousness was based on an insatiable thirst for truth and a deep feeling of justice extending to intellectual as well as material goods. He conceived spiritual life in the whole universe as a great system of law penetrated by eternal truth, and from this source he gained the firm confidence that death does not end all.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gauss declared he firmly believed in the <a class="uri" href="afterlife" title="wikilink">afterlife</a>, and saw spirituality as something essentially important for human beings.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He was quoted stating: <em>"The world would be nonsense, the whole creation an absurdity without immortality,"</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and for this statement he was severely criticized by the atheist <a href="Karl_Eugen_Dühring" title="wikilink">Eugen Dühring</a> who judged him as a narrow superstitious man.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>Though he was not a church-goer,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Gauss strongly upheld <a href="religious_tolerance" title="wikilink">religious tolerance</a>, believing "that one is not justified in disturbing another's religious belief, in which they find consolation for earthly sorrows in time of trouble."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> When his son Eugene announced that he wanted to become a Christian missionary, Gauss approved him saying that regardless of the problems within religious organizations, missionary work was "a highly honorable" task.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="family">Family</h2>

<p> Gauss's personal life was overshadowed by the early death of his first wife, Johanna Osthoff, in 1809, soon followed by the death of one child, Louis. Gauss plunged into a <a href="Clinical_depression" title="wikilink">depression</a> from which he never fully recovered. He married again, to Johanna's best friend named Friederica Wilhelmine Waldeck but commonly known as Minna. When his second wife died in 1831 after a long illness,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> one of his daughters, Therese, took over the household and cared for Gauss until the end of his life. His mother lived in his house from 1817 until her death in 1839.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>Gauss had six children. With Johanna (1780–1809), his children were Joseph (1806–1873), Wilhelmina (1808–1846) and Louis (1809–1810). With Minna Waldeck he also had three children: Eugene (1811–1896), Wilhelm (1813–1879) and Therese (1816–1864). Eugene shared a good measure of Gauss's talent in languages and computation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Therese kept house for Gauss until his death, after which she married.</p>

<p>Gauss eventually had conflicts with his sons. He did not want any of his sons to enter mathematics or science for "fear of lowering the family name", as he believed none of them would surpass his own achievements.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Gauss wanted Eugene to become a <a class="uri" href="lawyer" title="wikilink">lawyer</a>, but Eugene wanted to study languages. They had an argument over a party Eugene held, which Gauss refused to pay for. The son left in anger and, in about 1832, emigrated to the United States, where he was quite successful. While working for the American Fur Company in the Midwest, he learned the Sioux language. Later he moved to Missouri and became a successful businessman. Wilhelm also moved to America in 1837, and settled in <a class="uri" href="Missouri" title="wikilink">Missouri</a>, starting as a <a class="uri" href="farmer" title="wikilink">farmer</a> and later becoming wealthy in the shoe business in <a href="St._Louis,_Missouri" title="wikilink">St. Louis</a>. It took many years for Eugene's success to counteract his reputation among Gauss's friends and colleagues. See also <a href="s:Robert_Gauss_to_Felix_Klein_-_September_3,_1912" title="wikilink">the letter from Robert Gauss to Felix Klein</a> on 3 September 1912.</p>
<h2 id="personality">Personality</h2>

<p>Carl Gauss was an ardent <a href="perfectionism_(psychology)" title="wikilink">perfectionist</a> and a hard worker. He was never a prolific writer, refusing to publish work which he did not consider complete and above criticism. This was in keeping with his personal motto <em>pauca sed matura</em> ("few, but ripe"). His personal diaries indicate that he had made several important mathematical discoveries years or decades before his contemporaries published them. Mathematical historian <a href="Eric_Temple_Bell" title="wikilink">Eric Temple Bell</a> said that, had Gauss published all of his discoveries in a timely manner, he would have advanced mathematics by fifty years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>Though he did take in a few students, Gauss was known to dislike teaching. It is said that he attended only a single scientific conference, which was in <a class="uri" href="Berlin" title="wikilink">Berlin</a> in 1828. However, several of his students became influential mathematicians, among them <a href="Richard_Dedekind" title="wikilink">Richard Dedekind</a>, <a href="Bernhard_Riemann" title="wikilink">Bernhard Riemann</a>, and <a href="Friedrich_Bessel" title="wikilink">Friedrich Bessel</a>. Before she died, <a href="Sophie_Germain" title="wikilink">Sophie Germain</a> was recommended by Gauss to receive her honorary degree.</p>

<p>Gauss usually declined to present the intuition behind his often very elegant proofs—he preferred them to appear "out of thin air" and erased all traces of how he discovered them. This is justified, if unsatisfactorily, by Gauss in his "<a href="Disquisitiones_Arithmeticae" title="wikilink">Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</a>", where he states that all analysis (i.e., the paths one travelled to reach the solution of a problem) must be suppressed for sake of brevity.</p>

<p>Gauss supported the <a class="uri" href="monarchy" title="wikilink">monarchy</a> and opposed <a href="Napoleon_I_of_France" title="wikilink">Napoleon</a>, whom he saw as an outgrowth of <a class="uri" href="revolution" title="wikilink">revolution</a>.</p>
<h2 id="anecdotes">Anecdotes</h2>

<p>There are several stories of his early genius. According to one, his gifts became very apparent at the age of three when he corrected, mentally and without fault in his calculations, an error his father had made on paper while calculating finances.</p>

<p>Another story has it that in <a href="primary_school" title="wikilink">primary school</a> after the young Gauss misbehaved, his teacher, J.G. Büttner, gave him a task: add a list of <a href="integer" title="wikilink">integers</a> in <a href="arithmetic_progression" title="wikilink">arithmetic progression</a>; as the story is most often told, these were the numbers from 1 to 100. The young Gauss reputedly produced the correct answer within seconds, to the astonishment of his teacher and his assistant <a href="Johann_Christian_Martin_Bartels" title="wikilink">Martin Bartels</a>.</p>

<p>Gauss's presumed method was to realize that pairwise addition of terms from opposite ends of the list yielded identical intermediate sums: 1 + 100 = 101, 2 + 99 = 101, 3 + 98 = 101, and so on, for a <a href="Triangular_number" title="wikilink">total sum</a> of 50 × 101 = 5050. However, the details of the story are at best uncertain (see<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> for discussion of the original <a href="Wolfgang_Sartorius_von_Waltershausen" title="wikilink">Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen</a> source and the changes in other versions); some authors, such as Joseph Rotman in his book <em>A first course in Abstract Algebra</em>, question whether it ever happened.</p>

<p>According to <a href="Isaac_Asimov" title="wikilink">Isaac Asimov</a>, Gauss was once interrupted in the middle of a problem and told that his wife was dying. He is purported to have said, "Tell her to wait a moment till I'm done."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> This anecdote is briefly discussed in <a href="G._Waldo_Dunnington" title="wikilink">G. Waldo Dunnington</a>'s <em>Gauss, Titan of Science</em> where it is suggested that it is an <a class="uri" href="apocryphal" title="wikilink">apocryphal</a> story.</p>

<p>He referred to mathematics as "the queen of sciences"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> and supposedly once espoused a belief in the necessity of immediately understanding <a href="Euler's_identity" title="wikilink">Euler's identity</a> as a benchmark pursuant to becoming a first-class mathematician.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p>From 1989 through 2001, Gauss's portrait, a <a href="normal_distribution_curve" title="wikilink">normal distribution curve</a> and some prominent <a class="uri" href="Göttingen" title="wikilink">Göttingen</a> buildings were featured on the German ten-mark banknote. The reverse featured the approach for <a href="Kingdom_of_Hanover" title="wikilink">Hanover</a>. Germany has also issued three postage stamps honoring Gauss.

<li id="fn24">This reference from 1891 () says: "Gauss, 1492 grm. 957 grm. 219588. sq. mm."; i.e. the unit is <em>square mm</em>. In the later reference: Dunnington (1927), the unit is erroneously reported as square cm, which gives an unreasonably large area; the 1891 reference is more reliable.<a href="#fnref24">↩</a></li>
