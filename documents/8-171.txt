Pseudo-Zernike polynomials

In mathematics, Pseudo-Zernike polynomials are well known and widely used in the analysis of optical systems. They are also widely used in image analysis as shape descriptors.
Definition
They are an orthogonal set of complex-valued polynomials defined as :



where 
 
 
 
  and orthogonality on the unit disk is given as:



where the star means complex conjugation, and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are the standard transformations between polar and Cartesian coordinates.
The radial polynomials 
 
 
 
  are defined as:



with integer coefficients

Moments
The Pseudo-Zernike Moments (PZM) of order 
 
 
 
  and repetition 
 
 
 
  are defined as:



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  takes on positive and negative integer values subject to 
 
 
 
 .
The image function can be reconstructed by expansion of the Pseudo-Zernike coefficients on the unit disk as:



Pseudo-Zernike moments are derived from conventional Zernike moments and shown to be more robust and less sensitive to image noise than the Zernike moments.2
