   Toda's theorem      Toda's theorem   Toda's theorem is a result in computational complexity theory that was proven by Seinosuke Toda in his paper "PP is as Hard as the Polynomial-Time Hierarchy" (1991) and was given the 1998 Gödel Prize .  Statement  The theorem states that the entire polynomial hierarchy PH is contained in P PP ; this implies a closely related statement, that PH is contained in P #P .  Definitions  #P is the problem of exactly counting the number of solutions to a polynomially-verifiable question (that is, to a question in NP ), while loosely speaking, PP is the problem of giving an answer which is correct at least half the time. The class P #P consists of all the problems which can be solved in polynomial time if you have access to instantaneous answers to any counting problem in #P (polynomial time relative to a #P oracle ). Thus Toda's theorem implies that for any problem in the polynomial hierarchy there is a deterministic polynomial-time Turing reduction to a counting problem . 1  An analogous result in the complexity theory over the reals (in the sense of Blum-Shub-Smale real Turing machines ) was proved by Saugata Basu and Thierry Zell in 2009 2 and a complex analogue of Toda's theorem was proved by Saugata Basu in 2011. 3  Proof  The proof is broken into two parts.   First, it is established that          Σ  P   ⋅  𝖡𝖯  ⋅  ⊕  𝖯  ⊆  𝖡𝖯  ⋅  ⊕  𝖯     fragments   superscript  normal-Σ  P   normal-⋅  BP  normal-⋅  direct-sum  P   BP  normal-⋅  direct-sum  P    \Sigma^{P}\cdot\mathsf{BP}\cdot\oplus\mathsf{P}\subseteq\mathsf{BP}\cdot\oplus%
 \mathsf{P}         The proof uses a variation of Valiant-Vazirani theorem . Because    𝖡𝖯  ⋅  ⊕  𝖯     fragments  BP  normal-⋅  direct-sum  P    \mathsf{BP}\cdot\oplus\mathsf{P}   contains   𝖯   𝖯   \mathsf{P}   and is closed under complement, it follows by induction that    𝖯𝖧  ⊆  𝖡𝖯  ⋅  ⊕  𝖯     fragments  PH   BP  normal-⋅  direct-sum  P    \mathsf{PH}\subseteq\mathsf{BP}\cdot\oplus\mathsf{P}   .    Second, it is established that         𝖯  ⋅  ⊕  𝖯  ⊆   𝖯   ♯  P       fragments  P  normal-⋅  direct-sum  P    superscript  𝖯    normal-♯  P      \mathsf{P}\cdot\oplus\mathsf{P}\subseteq\mathsf{P}^{\sharp P}        Together, the two parts imply      𝖯𝖧  ⊆  𝖡𝖯  ⋅  ⊕  𝖯  ⊆  𝖯  ⋅  ⊕  𝖯  ⊆   𝖯   ♯  P       fragments  PH   BP  normal-⋅  direct-sum  P   P  normal-⋅  direct-sum  P    superscript  𝖯    normal-♯  P      \mathsf{PH}\subseteq\mathsf{BP}\cdot\oplus\mathsf{P}\subseteq\mathsf{P}\cdot%
