   Greenwood statistic      Greenwood statistic   The Greenwood statistic is a spacing statistic and can be used to evaluate clustering of events in time or locations in space. 1  Definition  In general, for a given sequence of events in time or space the statistic is given by:. 2        G   (  n  )    =    ∑   i  =  1    n  +  1     D  i  2     ,        G  n     subscript   superscript     n  1      i  1     subscript   superscript  D  2   i      G(n)=\sum^{n+1}_{i=1}D^{2}_{i},     where    D  i     subscript  D  i    D_{i}   represents the interval between events or points in space and is a number between 0 and 1 such that the sum of all     D  i   =  1       subscript  D  i   1    D_{i}=1   .  Where intervals are given by numbers that do not represent a fraction of the time period or distance, the Greenwood statistic is modified 3 and is given by:        G   (  n  )    =     ∑   i  =  1    n  +  1     X  i  2     T  n  2     ,        G  n       subscript   superscript     n  1      i  1     subscript   superscript  X  2   i     superscript   subscript  T  n   2      G(n)=\frac{\sum^{n+1}_{i=1}X^{2}_{i}}{T_{n}^{2}},     where:        T  n   =    ∑   i  =  1    n  +  1     X  i     ,       subscript  T  n     subscript   superscript     n  1      i  1     subscript  X  i      T_{n}=\sum^{n+1}_{i=1}X_{i},     and    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   represents the length of the 'i th interval, which is either the time between events or the distances between points in space.  A reformulation of the statistic yields        G   (  n  )    =     1   n  +  1      (      n   n  +  1      C  v  2    +  1   )     ,        G  n       1    n  1          n    n  1     superscript   subscript  C  v   2    1      G(n)=\tfrac{1}{n+1}(\tfrac{n}{n+1}C_{v}^{2}+1),     where    C  v     subscript  C  v    C_{v}   is the sample coefficient of variation of the n + 1 interval lengths.  Properties  The Greenwood statistic is a comparative measure that has a range of values between 0 and 1. For example, applying the Greenwood statistic to the arrival of 11 buses in a given time period of say 1 hour, where in the first example all eleven buses arrived at a given point each 6 minutes apart, would give a result of roughly 0.10. However, in the second example if the buses became bunched up or clustered so that 6 buses arrived 10 minutes apart and then 5 buses arrived 2 minutes apart in the last 10 minutes, the result is roughly 0.17. The result for a random distribution of 11 bus arrival times in an hour will fall somewhere between 0.10 and 0.17. So this can be used to tell how well a bus system is running and in a similar way, the Greenwood statistic was also used to determine how and where genes are placed in the chromosomes of living organisms. 4 This research showed that there is a definite order to where genes are placed, particularly with regard to what function the genes perform, and this is important in the science of genetics.
