Lami's theorem

In statics, Lami's theorem is an equation relating the magnitudes of three coplanar, concurrent and non-collinear forces, which keeps an object in static equilibrium, with the angles directly opposite to the corresponding forces. According to the theorem,




where A, B and C are the magnitudes of three coplanar, concurrent and non-collinear forces, which keep the object in static equilibrium, and
 


α, β and γ are the angles directly opposite to the forces A, B and C respectively.
 





Lami's theorem is applied in static analysis of mechanical and structural systems. The theorem is named after Bernard Lamy.
Proof of Lami's Theorem
Suppose there are three coplanar, concurrent and non-collinear forces, which keeps the object in static equilibrium. By the triangle law, we can re-construct the diagram as follow:




By the law of sines,
