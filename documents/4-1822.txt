   Lami's theorem      Lami's theorem   In statics , Lami's theorem is an equation relating the magnitudes of three coplanar , concurrent and non-collinear forces, which keeps an object in static equilibrium , with the angles directly opposite to the corresponding forces. According to the theorem,       A   sin  α    =   B   sin  β    =   C   sin  γ            A    α      B    β           C    γ       \frac{A}{\sin\alpha}=\frac{B}{\sin\beta}=\frac{C}{\sin\gamma}      where A , B and C are the magnitudes of three coplanar, concurrent and non-collinear forces, which keep the object in static equilibrium, and    α , β and γ are the angles directly opposite to the forces A , B and C respectively.       Lami's theorem is applied in static analysis of mechanical and structural systems. The theorem is named after Bernard Lamy .  Proof of Lami's Theorem  Suppose there are three coplanar, concurrent and non-collinear forces, which keeps the object in static equilibrium. By the triangle law , we can re-construct the diagram as follow:      By the law of sines ,       A   sin   (   π  -  α   )     =   B   sin   (   π  -  β   )     =   C   sin   (   π  -  γ   )             A      π  α       B      π  β            C      π  γ        \frac{A}{\sin(\pi-\alpha)}=\frac{B}{\sin(\pi-\beta)}=\frac{C}{\sin(\pi-\gamma)}          ⇒   A   sin  α    =   B   sin  β    =   C   sin  γ         normal-⇒  absent    A    α           B    β           C    γ       \Rightarrow\frac{A}{\sin\alpha}=\frac{B}{\sin\beta}=\frac{C}{\sin\gamma}     See also   Bernard Lamy (mathematician)  Law of sines  Mechanical equilibrium  Parallelogram of force   Further reading   R.K.
