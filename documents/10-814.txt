   Precorrin-2 C20-methyltransferase      Precorrin-2 C20-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a precorrin-2 C20-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + precorrin-2   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + precorrin-3A   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and precorrin 2 , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and precorrin 3A .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:precorrin-4 C20-methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
