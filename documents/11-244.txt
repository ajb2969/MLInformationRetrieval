(S)-2-methylmalate dehydratase




(S)-2-methylmalate dehydratase

In enzymology, a (S)-2-methylmalate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-2-methylmalate 
 
 
 
  2-methylfumarate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (S)-2-methylmalate, and two products, 2-methylfumarate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-2-methylmalate hydro-lyase (2-methylfumarate-forming). Other names in common use include mesaconate hydratase, (+)-citramalate hydro-lyase, L-citramalate hydrolase, citramalate dehydratase, (+)-citramalic hydro-lyase, mesaconate mesaconase, mesaconase, and (S)-2-methylmalate hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism.
