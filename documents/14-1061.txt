   Omnitruncated simplectic honeycomb      Omnitruncated simplectic honeycomb   In geometry an omnitruncated simplectic honeycomb or omnitruncated n-simplex honeycomb is an n-dimensional uniform tessellation , based on the symmetry of the     A  ~   n     subscript   normal-~  A   n    {\tilde{A}}_{n}   affine Coxeter group . Each is composed of omnitruncated  simplex  facets . The vertex figure for each is an irregular n-simplex.  The facets of an omnitruncated simplectic honeycomb are called permutahedra and can be positioned in n+1 space with integral coordinates, permutations of the whole numbers (0,1,..,n).      height=30|n        A  ~    1  +      subscript   normal-~  A    limit-from  1      {\tilde{A}}_{1+}      Image   Tessellation   Facets   Vertex figure   Facets per vertex figure   Vertices per vertex figure       1        A  ~   1     subscript   normal-~  A   1    {\tilde{A}}_{1}     (Figure)  Uniform apeirogon.png    Apeirogon    Line segment   Line segment   1   2     2        A  ~   2     subscript   normal-~  A   2    {\tilde{A}}_{2}     (Figure)  Uniform tiling 333-t012.png    Hexagonal tiling     hexagon   Equilateral triangle    3 hexagons   3     3        A  ~   3     subscript   normal-~  A   3    {\tilde{A}}_{3}     (Figure)  Bitruncated_cubic_honeycomb2.png    Bitruncated cubic honeycomb     Truncated octahedron   irr. tetrahedron    4 truncated octahedron   4     4        A  ~   4     subscript   normal-~  A   4    {\tilde{A}}_{4}       Omnitruncated 4-simplex honeycomb     Omnitruncated 4-simplex   irr. 5-cell    5 omnitruncated 4-simplex   5     5        A  ~   5     subscript   normal-~  A   5    {\tilde{A}}_{5}       Omnitruncated 5-simplex honeycomb     Omnitruncated 5-simplex   irr. 5-simplex    6 omnitruncated 5-simplex   6     6        A  ~   6     subscript   normal-~  A   6    {\tilde{A}}_{6}       Omnitruncated 6-simplex honeycomb     Omnitruncated 6-simplex   irr. 6-simplex    7 omnitruncated 6-simplex   7     7        A  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  A   7    {\tilde{A}}_{7}       Omnitruncated 7-simplex honeycomb     Omnitruncated 7-simplex   irr. 7-simplex    8 omnitruncated 7-simplex   8     8        A  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  A   8    {\tilde{A}}_{8}       Omnitruncated 8-simplex honeycomb     Omnitruncated 8-simplex   irr. 8-simplex    9 omnitruncated 8-simplex   9     Projection by folding  The (2n-1)-simplex honeycombs can be projected into the n-dimensional omnitruncated  hypercubic honeycomb by a geometric folding operation that maps two pairs of mirrors into each other, sharing the same vertex arrangement :           A  ~   3     subscript   normal-~  A   3    {\tilde{A}}_{3}            A  ~   5     subscript   normal-~  A   5    {\tilde{A}}_{5}            A  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  A   7    {\tilde{A}}_{7}            A  ~   9     subscript   normal-~  A   9    {\tilde{A}}_{9}       ...
