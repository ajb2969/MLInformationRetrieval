Omnitruncated simplectic honeycomb

In geometry an omnitruncated simplectic honeycomb or omnitruncated n-simplex honeycomb is an n-dimensional uniform tessellation, based on the symmetry of the 
 
 
 
  affine Coxeter group. Each is composed of omnitruncated simplex facets. The vertex figure for each is an irregular n-simplex.
The facets of an omnitruncated simplectic honeycomb are called permutahedra and can be positioned in n+1 space with integral coordinates, permutations of the whole numbers (0,1,..,n).

Projection by folding
The (2n-1)-simplex honeycombs can be projected into the n-dimensional omnitruncated hypercubic honeycomb by a geometric folding operation that maps two pairs of mirrors into each other, sharing the same vertex arrangement:
