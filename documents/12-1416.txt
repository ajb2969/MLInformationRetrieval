   Papyrus 18      Papyrus 18   Papyrus 18 (in the Gregory–Aland numbering ), designated by   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    18 , is an early copy of the New Testament in Greek . It is a papyrus  manuscript containing the beginning of the Book of Revelation . It contains only Rev 1:4–7. It is written against the fibres of the papyrus. On the other side of the papyrus is the ending of the book of Exodus . It is unclear whether the papyrus was a scroll of Exodus later reused for a copy of Revelation or a leaf from a codex with miscellaneous contents. 1 The two sides of the papyrus were copied in different hands, but the original editor of the papyrus did not think there was a great interval of time between the copying of the two sides. He assigned the Exodus to the third century and the Revelation to the third or early fourth century. 2  Description  The Greek text of this manuscript is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type . Aland placed it in Category I . 3   Rev 1:5    λυσαντι ημας εκ — P 18 , א c , A , C , 2020, 2081, 2814   λουσαντι ημας απο — P , 046 , 94 , 1006, 1859, 2042, 2065, 2073, 2138, 2432   It is currently housed at the British Library (Inv. 2053v) in London . 4  Text  [Ιωαννης τα]ι[ς επτα] εκ[κλης]ιαις [ταις εν τη] Ασια χαρις υμειν και ειρη [νη απο ο ων] και ο ην και ο ερχομε [νος και απο τ[ων επτα πνευμα [των α] εν[ω]πιον του θρονου αυ [τ]ου και απο     Ι  Η   ¯     normal-¯    normal-Ι  normal-Η     \overline{ΙΗ}        Χ  Ρ   ¯     normal-¯    normal-Χ  normal-Ρ     \overline{ΧΡ}   ο μαρτυς ο πι στος ο πρωτοτοκος των νεκρω και ο αρχων των βασιλεων της γης τω αγαμωντι ημας και λυσαντι η [μ]ας εκ των αμαρτων ημων εν [τ]ω αιματι αυτου και επιησεν ημ[ι] [βα]σ[ιλ]ειαν ιερεις του     θ  υ   ¯     normal-¯    θ  υ     \overline{θυ}    a και π[α]τρι [αυτο]υ. αυτω το κρατος και η δοξα [εις το]υς αιωνας αμην ιδου [ερχε]ται μετα των νεφελων [και οψε]ται αυτον πας οφθαλ [μος και ο]ιτινες αυτον εξε  a The scribe corrected this to τω     θ  ω   ¯     normal-¯    θ  ω     \overline{θω}     See also   List of New Testament papyri   References  Further reading    Brent Nongbri.
