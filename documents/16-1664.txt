   Polynomial least squares      Polynomial least squares   In mathematical statistics , polynomial least squares refers to a broad range of statistical methods for estimating an underlying polynomial that describes observations. These methods include polynomial regression , curve fitting , linear regression , least squares , ordinary least squares , simple linear regression , linear least squares , approximation theory and method of moments . Polynomial least squares has applications in radar trackers , estimation theory , signal processing , statistics , and econometrics .  Two common applications of polynomial least squares methods are approximating a low-degree polynomial that approximates a complicated function and estimating an assumed underlying polynomial from corrupted (also known as "noisy") observations. The former is commonly used in statistics and econometrics to fit a scatter plot with a first degree polynomial (that is, a line). 1 2 3 The latter is commonly used in target tracking in the form of Kalman filtering , which is effectively a recursive implementation of polynomial least squares. 4 5 6 7 Estimating an assumed underlying deterministic polynomial can be used in econometrics as well. 8 In effect, both applications produce average curves as generalizations of the common average of a set of numbers, which is equivalent to zero degree polynomial least squares. 9 10 11  In the above applications, the term "approximate" is used when no statistical measurement or observation errors are assumed, as when fitting a scatter plot. The term "estimate", derived from statistical estimation theory, is used when assuming that measurements or observations of a polynomial are corrupted.  Polynomial least squares estimate of a deterministic first degree polynomial corrupted with observation errors  Assume the deterministic first degree polynomial equation    y   y   y    with unknown coefficients    α   α   \alpha    and    β   β   \beta    as follows:      y  =   α  +   β  t        y    α    β  t      y=\alpha+\beta t     which is corrupted with an additive stochastic process    ε   ε   \varepsilon   , described as an error (noise in tracking) written as      z  =   y  +  ε   =   α  +   β  t   +  ε         z    y  ε          α    β  t   ε      z=y+\varepsilon=\alpha+\beta t+\varepsilon     Given samples    z  n     subscript  z  n    z_{n}   where the subscript    n   n   n    is the sample index, the problem is to apply polynomial least squares to estimate     y   (  t  )       y  t    y(t)    , and to determine its variance along with its expected value .  Definitions and assumptions  (1) The term linearity in mathematics may be considered to take two forms that are sometimes confusing: a linear "system" or transformation (sometimes called an operator) 12 and a linear equation. The term "function" is often used to describe both a system and an equation, which may lead to confusion. A linear system is defined by       f   (    a  x   +   b  y    )    =    a  f   (  x  )    +   b  f   (  y  )           f      a  x     b  y         a  f  x     b  f  y      f(ax+by)=af(x)+bf(y)     where   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   are constants, and where   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   are variables. In a linear "system"     E   [   f   (  x  )    ]    =   f   (   E   [  x  ]    )          E   delimited-[]    f  x       f    E   delimited-[]  x       E[f(x)]=f(E[x])   , where   E   E   E   is the linear expectation operator. A linear equation is a straight line as is the first degree polynomial described above.  (2) The error   ε   ε   \varepsilon   is modeled as a zero mean stochastic process, samples of which are random variables that are uncorrelated and assumed to have identical probability distributions (specifically same mean and variance), but not necessarily Gaussian , treated as inputs to polynomial least squares . Stochastic processes and random variables are described only by probability distributions. 13 14 15  (3) Polynomial least squares is modeled as a linear signal processing "system" which processes statistical inputs deterministically, the output being the linearly processed empirically determined statistical estimate, variance, and expected value. 16 17 18  (4) Polynomial least squares processing produces deterministic moments (analogous to mechanical moments), which may be considered as moments of sample statistics, but not of statistical moments. 19  Polynomial least squares and the orthogonality principle  Approximating a function     z   (  t  )       z  t    z(t)    with a polynomial        z  ^    (  t  )    =    ∑   j  =  1   J     a  j    t   j  -  1             normal-^  z   t     superscript   subscript     j  1    J      subscript  a  j    superscript  t    j  1        \hat{z}(t)=\sum_{j=1}^{J}a_{j}t^{j-1}     where hat (^) denotes the estimate and ( J − 1) is the polynomial degree, can be performed by applying the orthogonality principle . The error    e   e   e    in the sum of the squared errors can be written as      e  =    ∑   n  =  1   N     (    z  n   -    z  ^   n    )   2        e    superscript   subscript     n  1    N    superscript     subscript  z  n    subscript   normal-^  z   n    2      e=\sum_{n=1}^{N}(z_{n}-\hat{z}_{n})^{2}     According to the orthogonality principle, 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27     e   e   e    is minimum when the error (    z  -   z  ^       z   normal-^  z     z-\hat{z}   ) is orthogonal to the estimate    z  ^     normal-^  z    \hat{z}   , that is        ∑   n  =  1   N     (    z  n   -    z  ^   n    )     z  ^   n     =  0        superscript   subscript     n  1    N        subscript  z  n    subscript   normal-^  z   n     subscript   normal-^  z   n     0    \sum_{n=1}^{N}(z_{n}-\hat{z}_{n})\hat{z}_{n}=0     This can be described as the orthogonal projection of the data    z  n     subscript  z  n    z_{n}   onto a solution in the form of the polynomial     z  ^    (  t  )        normal-^  z   t    \hat{z}(t)   . 28 29 30 For N > J , orthogonal projection yields the standard overdetermined system of equations (often called normal equations ) used to compute the coefficients in the polynomial approximation. 31 32 33 The minimum    e   e   e    is then       e  min   =    ∑   n  =  1   N     (    z  n   -    z  ^   n    )    z  n          subscript  e      superscript   subscript     n  1    N        subscript  z  n    subscript   normal-^  z   n     subscript  z  n       e_{\min}=\sum_{n=1}^{N}(z_{n}-\hat{z}_{n})z_{n}     The advantage of using orthogonal projection is that    e  min     subscript  e     e_{\min}   can be determined for use in the polynomial least squares processed statistical variance of the estimate. 34 35 36  The empirically determined polynomial least squares output of a first degree polynomial corrupted with a observation errors  To fully determine the output of polynomial least squares , a weighting function describing the processing must first be structured and then the statistical moments can be computed.  The weighting function describing the linear polynomial least squares "system"  The weighting function     w  n    (  τ  )        subscript  w  n   τ    w_{n}(\tau)   can be formulated from polynomial least squares to estimate the unknown     y   (  t  )       y  t    y(t)    as follows: 37        y  ^    (  τ  )    =    1  N     ∑   n  =  1   N     z  n    w  n    (  τ  )      =    1  N     ∑   n  =  1   N     (   α  +   β   t  n    +   ε  n    )    w  n    (  τ  )               normal-^  y   τ       1  N     superscript   subscript     n  1    N      subscript  z  n    subscript  w  n   τ              1  N     superscript   subscript     n  1    N       α    β   subscript  t  n     subscript  ε  n     subscript  w  n   τ        \hat{y}(\tau)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N}z_{n}w_{n}(\tau)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^%

The overbar ( ¯ ) defines the deterministic centroid of    u  n     subscript  u  n    u_{n}   as processed by polynomial least squares  39 – i.e., it defines the deterministic first order moment, which may be considered a sample average, but does not here approximate a first order statistical moment:       u  ¯    =    def     1  N     ∑   n  =  1   N    u  n         normal-¯  u     def  absent       1  N     superscript   subscript     n  1    N    subscript  u  n      \bar{u}\overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N}u_{n}     Empirically determined statistical moments  Applying     w  n    (  τ  )        subscript  w  n   τ    w_{n}(\tau)   yields        y  ^    (  τ  )    =    α  ^   +    β  ^   τ           normal-^  y   τ      normal-^  α      normal-^  β   τ      \hat{y}(\tau)=\hat{\alpha}+\hat{\beta}\tau     where       α  ^   =    (     z  ¯     t  2   ¯    -     z  t   ¯    t  ¯     )    (     t  2   ¯   -    t  ¯   2    )    =   α  +    (     ε  ¯     t  2   ¯    -     ε  t   ¯    t  ¯     )    (     t  2   ¯   -    t  ¯   2    )            normal-^  α          normal-¯  z    normal-¯   superscript  t  2        normal-¯    z  t     normal-¯  t        normal-¯   superscript  t  2     superscript   normal-¯  t   2            α         normal-¯  ε    normal-¯   superscript  t  2        normal-¯    ε  t     normal-¯  t        normal-¯   superscript  t  2     superscript   normal-¯  t   2         \hat{\alpha}=\frac{(\bar{z}\bar{t^{2}}-\bar{zt}\bar{t})}{(\bar{t^{2}}-\bar{t}^%

Setting the derivative of    σ   y  ^   2     superscript   subscript  σ   normal-^  y    2    \sigma_{\hat{y}}^{2}   with respect to   τ   τ   \tau   equal to zero shows the minimum to occur at    τ  =   t  ¯       τ   normal-¯  t     \tau=\bar{t}   ; i.e., at the centroid (sample average) of the samples    t  n     subscript  t  n    t_{n}   . The minimum statistical variance thus becomes     σ  ε  2   N       superscript   subscript  σ  ε   2   N    \frac{\sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2}}{N}   . This is equivalent to the statistical variance from polynomial least squares of a zero degree polynomial – i.e., of the centroid (sample average) of   α   α   \alpha   . 54 55 56  57  (2) The empirical statistical variance    σ   y  ^   2     superscript   subscript  σ   normal-^  y    2    \sigma_{\hat{y}}^{2}   is a function of the quadratic    τ  2     superscript  τ  2    \tau^{2}   . Moreover, the further   τ   τ   \tau   deviates from    t  ¯     normal-¯  t    \bar{t}   (even within the data window), the larger is the variance    σ   y  ^   2     superscript   subscript  σ   normal-^  y    2    \sigma_{\hat{y}}^{2}   due to the random variable errors    ε  n     subscript  ε  n    \varepsilon_{n}   . The independent variable   τ   τ   \tau   can take any value on the   t   t   t   axis. It is not limited to the data window. It can extend beyond the data window – and likely will at times depending on the application. If it is within the data window, estimation is described as interpolation. If it is outside the data window, estimation is described as extrapolation. It is both intuitive and well known that the further is extrapolation, the larger is the error. 58  (3) The empirical statistical variance    σ   y  ^   2     superscript   subscript  σ   normal-^  y    2    \sigma_{\hat{y}}^{2}   due to the random variable errors    ε  n     subscript  ε  n    \varepsilon_{n}   is inversely proportional to N . As N increases, the statistical variance decreases. This is well known and what filtering out the errors    ε  n     subscript  ε  n    \varepsilon_{n}   is all about. 59 60 61 62 The underlying purpose of polynomial least squares is to filter out the errors to improve estimation accuracy by reducing the empirical statistical estimation variance. In reality, only two data points are required to estimate   α   α   \alpha   and   β   β   \beta   ; albeit the more data points with zero mean statistical errors included, the smaller is the empirical statistical estimation variance as established by N samples.  (4) There is an additional issue to be considered when the noise variance is not measurable: Independent of the polynomial least squares estimation, any new observations would be described by the variance     σ  ε  2   ≈    σ  ε  2   ^   =   (     z  2   ¯   -    α  ^    z  ¯    -    β  ^     z  t   ¯     )          superscript   subscript  σ  ε   2    normal-^   superscript   subscript  σ  ε   2            normal-¯   superscript  z  2       normal-^  α    normal-¯  z       normal-^  β    normal-¯    z  t         \sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2}\approx\hat{\sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2}}=(\bar{z^{2}}-%
 \hat{\alpha}\bar{z}-\hat{\beta}\bar{zt})   . 63 64  Thus, the polynomial least squares statistical estimation variance    σ   y  ^   2     superscript   subscript  σ   normal-^  y    2    \sigma_{\hat{y}}^{2}   and the statistical variance of any new sample in    σ  ε  2     superscript   subscript  σ  ε   2    \sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2}   would both contribute to the uncertainty of any future observation. Both variances are clearly determined by polynomial least squares in advance.  (5) This concept also applies to higher degree polynomials. However, the weighting function     w  n    (  τ  )        subscript  w  n   τ    w_{n}(\tau)   is obviously more complicated. In addition, the estimation variances increase exponentially as polynomial degrees increase linearly (i.e., in unit steps). However, there are ways of dealing with this as described in. 65 66  The synergy of integrating polynomial least squares with statistical estimation theory  Modeling polynomial least squares as a linear signal processing "system" creates the synergy of integrating polynomial least squares with statistical estimation theory to deterministically process samples of an assumed polynomial corrupted with a statistically described stochastic error ε. In the absence of the error ε, statistical estimation theory is irrelevant and polynomial least squares reverts back to the conventional approximation of complicated functions and scatter plots.
