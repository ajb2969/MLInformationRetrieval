   Constraint inference      Constraint inference   In constraint satisfaction , constraint inference is a relationship between constraints and their consequences. A set of constraints   D   D   D   entails a constraint   C   C   C   if every solution to   D   D   D   is also a solution to   C   C   C   . In other words, if   V   V   V   is a valuation of the variables in the scopes of the constraints in   D   D   D   and all constraints in   D   D   D   are satisfied by   V   V   V   , then   V   V   V   also satisfies the constraint   C   C   C   .  Some operations on constraints produce a new constraint that is a consequence of them. Constraint composition operates on a pair of binary constraints    (   (  x  ,  y  )   ,  R  )      x  y   R    ((x,y),R)   and    (   (  y  ,  z  )   ,  S  )      y  z   S    ((y,z),S)   with a common variable. The composition of such two constraints is the constraint    (   (  x  ,  z  )   ,  Q  )      x  z   Q    ((x,z),Q)   that is satisfied by every evaluation of the two non-shared variables for which there exists a value of the shared variable   y   y   y   such that the evaluation of these three variables satisfies the two original constraints    (   (  x  ,  y  )   ,  R  )      x  y   R    ((x,y),R)   and    (   (  y  ,  z  )   ,  S  )      y  z   S    ((y,z),S)   .  Constraint projection restricts the effects of a constraint to some of its variables. Given a constraint    (  t  ,  R  )     t  R    (t,R)   its projection to a subset    t  ′     superscript  t  normal-′    t^{\prime}   of its variables is the constraint    (   t  ′   ,   R  ′   )      superscript  t  normal-′    superscript  R  normal-′     (t^{\prime},R^{\prime})   that is satisfied by an evaluation if this evaluation can be extended to the other variables in such a way the original constraint    (  t  ,  R  )     t  R    (t,R)   is satisfied.  Extended composition is similar in principle to composition, but allows for an arbitrary number of possibly non-binary constraints; the generated constraint is on an arbitrary subset of the variables of the original constraints. Given constraints     C  1   ,  …  ,   C  m       subscript  C  1   normal-…   subscript  C  m     C_{1},\ldots,C_{m}   and a list   A   A   A   of their variables, the extended composition of them is the constraint    (  A  ,  R  )     A  R    (A,R)   where an evaluation of   A   A   A   satisfies this constraint if it can be extended to the other variables so that     C  1   ,  …  ,   C  m       subscript  C  1   normal-…   subscript  C  m     C_{1},\ldots,C_{m}   are all satisfied.
