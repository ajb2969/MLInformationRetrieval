Overlapping distribution method

The Overlapping distribution method was introduced by Charles H. Bennett1 for estimating chemical potential.
Theory
For two N particle systems 0 and 1 with partition function

 
  and 
 
 
 
  ,
from 
 
 

get the thermodynamic free energy difference is 
 
 

For every configuration visited during this sampling of system 1 we can compute the potential energy U as a function of the configuration space, and the potential energy difference is



Now construct a probability density of the potential energy from the above equation:



where in 
 
 
 
  is a configurational part of a partition function




since




now define two functions:



thus that



and
 
 
 
  can be obtained by fitting 
 
 
 
  and
