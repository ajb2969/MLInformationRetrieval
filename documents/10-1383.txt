   Coenzyme F420 hydrogenase      Coenzyme F420 hydrogenase   In enzymology , a coenzyme F420 hydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   H 2 + coenzyme F 420    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   reduced coenzyme F 420    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are H 2 and coenzyme F420 , whereas its product is reduced coenzyme F420.  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on hydrogen as donor with other, known, acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hydrogen:coenzyme F420 oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin-reducing hydrogenase , F420-reducing hydrogenase , and coenzyme F420-dependent hydrogenase . This enzyme participates in folate biosynthesis and is a critical part of energy conservation in some methanogens such as Methanosarcina barkeri . It has 3 cofactors : iron , nickel , and deazaflavin .
