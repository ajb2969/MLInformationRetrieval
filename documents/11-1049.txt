   Oximinotransferase      Oximinotransferase   In enzymology , an oximinotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   pyruvate oxime + acetone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyruvate + acetone oxime   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are pyruvate oxime and acetone , whereas its two products are pyruvate and acetone oxime .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring nitrogenous groups oximinotransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pyruvate-oxime:acetone oximinotransferase . Other names in common use include transoximinase , oximase , pyruvate-acetone oximinotransferase , and transoximase .  References       "  Category:EC 2.6.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
