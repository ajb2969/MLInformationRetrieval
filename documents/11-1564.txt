Phosphatidylcholine synthase




Phosphatidylcholine synthase

In enzymology, a phosphatidylcholine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

CDP-diacylglycerol + choline 
 
 
 
  CMP + phosphatidylcholine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CDP-diacylglycerol and choline, whereas its two products are CMP and phosphatidylcholine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring non-standard substituted phosphate groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CDP-diacylglycerol:choline O-phosphatidyltransferase. This enzyme is also called CDP-diglyceride-choline O-phosphatidyltransferase. This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism.
