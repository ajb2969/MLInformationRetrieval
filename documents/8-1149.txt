Fáry's theorem

In mathematics, Fary's theorem states that any simple planar graph can be drawn without crossings so that its edges are straight line segments. That is, the ability to draw graph edges as curves instead of as straight line segments does not allow a larger class of graphs to be drawn. The theorem is named after István Fáry, although it was proved independently by , , and .
Proof
 One way of proving Fáry's theorem is to use mathematical induction.1 Let 
 
 
 
  be a simple planar graph with 
 
 
 
  vertices; we may add edges if necessary so that 
 
 
 
  is maximal planar. All faces of 
 
 
 
  will be triangles, as we could add an edge into any face with more sides while preserving planarity, contradicting the assumption of maximal planarity. Choose some three vertices 
 
 
 
  forming a triangular face of 
 
 
 
 . We prove by induction on 
 
 
 
  that there exists a straight-line embedding of 
 
 
 
  in which triangle 
 
 
 
  is the outer face of the embedding. As a base case, the result is trivial when 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the only vertices in 
 
 
 
 . Otherwise, all vertices in 
 
 
 
  have at least three neighbors.
By Euler's formula for planar graphs, 
 
 
 
  has 
 
 
 
  edges; equivalently, if one defines the deficiency of a vertex 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  to be 
 
 
 
 , the sum of the deficiencies is 
 
 
 
 . Each vertex in 
 
 
 
  can have deficiency at most three, so there are at least four vertices with positive deficiency. In particular we can choose a vertex 
 
 
 
  with at most five neighbors that is different from 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be formed by removing 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  and retriangulating the face formed by removing 
 
 
 
 . By induction, 
 
 
 
  has a straight line embedding in which 
 
 
 
  is the outer face. Remove the added edges in 
 
 
 
 , forming a polygon 
 
 
 
  with at most five sides into which 
 
 
 
  should be placed to complete the drawing. By the Art gallery theorem, there exists a point interior to 
 
 
 
  at which 
 
 
 
  can be placed so that the edges from 
 
 
 
  to the vertices of 
 
 
 
  do not cross any other edges, completing the proof.
The induction step of this proof is illustrated at right.

De Fraysseix, Pach and Pollack showed how to find in linear time a straight-line drawing in a grid with dimensions linear in the size of the graph, giving a universal point set with quadratic size. A similar method has been followed by Schnyder to prove enhanced bounds and a characterization of planarity based on the incidence partial order. His work stressed the existence of a particular partition of the edges of a maximal planar graph into three trees known as a Schnyder wood.
Tutte's spring theorem states that every 3-connected planar graph can be drawn on a plane without crossings so that its edges are straight line segments and an outside face is a convex polygon (Tutte 1963). It is so called because such an embedding can be found as the equilibrium position for a system of springs representing the edges of the graph.
Steinitz's theorem states that every 3-connected planar graph can be represented as the edges of a convex polyhedron in three-dimensional space. A straight-line embedding of $G,$ of the type described by Tutte's theorem, may be formed by projecting such a polyhedral representation onto the plane.
The Circle packing theorem states that every planar graph may be represented as the intersection graph of a collection of non-crossing circles in the plane. Placing each vertex of the graph at the center of the corresponding circle leads to a straight line representation.
Heiko Harborth raised the question of whether every planar graph has a straight line representation in which all edge lengths are integers.2 The truth of Harborth's conjecture remains unknown . However, integer-distance straight line embeddings are known to exist for cubic graphs.3  raised the question of whether every graph with a linkless embedding in three-dimensional Euclidean space has a linkless embedding in which all edges are represented by straight line segments, analogously to Fáry's theorem for two-dimensional embeddings.
