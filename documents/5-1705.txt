   Electrostatic ion cyclotron wave      Electrostatic ion cyclotron wave   In plasma physics , an electrostatic ion cyclotron wave is a longitudinal oscillation of the ions (and electrons ) in a magnetized plasma , propagating nearly (but not exactly) perpendicular to the magnetic field . The angle (in radians ) between the direction of propagation and the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field must be greater than about the square root of the mass ratio,        m  e    m  i           subscript  m  e    subscript  m  i      \sqrt{\frac{m_{e}}{m_{i}}}   ,  in order that the electrons can move along the field lines from crest to trough to satisfy the Boltzmann relation . The dispersion relation is       ω  2   =    Ω  c  2   +    k  2    v  s  2          superscript  ω  2      superscript   subscript  normal-Ω  c   2      superscript  k  2    superscript   subscript  v  s   2       \omega^{2}=\Omega_{c}^{2}+k^{2}v_{s}^{2}   , 1  where Ω c is the ion cyclotron frequency and v s is the ion sound speed . This relation is the result of restoring forces due to the Lorentz force (see Upper hybrid oscillation for more details), the electrostatic force (the T e term in v s ), and the ion pressure (the T i term in v s ).
