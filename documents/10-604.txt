Quinate dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a quinate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-quinate + NAD+

 
  3-dehydroquinate + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-quinate and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are 3-dehydroquinate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-quinate:NAD+ 3-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include quinic dehydrogenase, quinate:NAD oxidoreductase, quinate 5-dehydrogenase, and quinate:NAD+ 5-oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis.
