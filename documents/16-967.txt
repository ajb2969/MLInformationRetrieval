Symplectic basis

In linear algebra, a standard symplectic basis is a basis 
 
 
 
  of a symplectic vector space, a vector space with a nondegenerate alternating bilinear form 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
 . A symplectic basis always exists; it can be constructed by a procedure similar to the Gram–Schmidt process.1
