   Restricted partial quotients      Restricted partial quotients   In mathematics , and more particularly in the analytic theory of regular continued fractions , an infinite regular continued fraction x is said to be restricted , or composed of restricted partial quotients , if the sequence of denominators of its partial quotients is bounded; that is       x  =   [   a  0   ;   a  1   ,   a  2   ,  …  ]   =    a  0   +   1    a  1   +    1    a  2   +    1    a  3   +    1    a  4   +  ⋱              =    a  0   +    K   i  =  1   ∞    1   a  i       ,        x    subscript  a  0    subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-…           subscript  a  0    continued-fraction  1     subscript  a  1    continued-fraction  1     subscript  a  2    continued-fraction  1     subscript  a  3    continued-fraction  1     subscript  a  4   normal-⋱                   subscript  a  0        i  1    infinity  K      1   subscript  a  i         x=[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},\dots]=a_{0}+\cfrac{1}{a_{1}+\cfrac{1}{a_{2}+\cfrac{1}{a_%

 1}{a_{i}},\,     and there is some positive integer M such that all the (integral) partial denominators a i are less than or equal to M . 1 2  Periodic continued fractions  A regular periodic continued fraction consists of a finite initial block of partial denominators followed by a repeating block; if       ζ  =   [   a  0   ;   a  1   ,   a  2   ,  …  ,   a  k   ,     a   k  +  1    ,   a   k  +  2    ,  …  ,   a   k  +  m     ¯   ]    ,      ζ    subscript  a  0    subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-…   subscript  a  k    normal-¯    subscript  a    k  1     subscript  a    k  2    normal-…   subscript  a    k  m         \zeta=[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{k},\overline{a_{k+1},a_{k+2},\dots,a_{k+m}}],\,     then ζ is a quadratic irrational number, and its representation as a regular continued fraction is periodic. Clearly any regular periodic continued fraction consists of restricted partial quotients, since none of the partial denominators can be greater than the largest of a 0 through a k + m . Historically, mathematicians studied periodic continued fractions before considering the more general concept of restricted partial quotients.  Restricted CFs and the Cantor set  The Cantor set is a set C of measure zero from which a complete interval of real numbers can be constructed by simple addition – that is, any real number from the interval can be expressed as the sum of exactly two elements of the set C . The usual proof of the existence of the Cantor set is based on the idea of punching a "hole" in the middle of an interval, then punching holes in the remaining sub-intervals, and repeating this process ad infinitum .  The process of adding one more partial quotient to a finite continued fraction is in many ways analogous to this process of "punching a hole" in an interval of real numbers. The size of the "hole" is inversely proportional to the next partial denominator chosen – if the next partial denominator is 1, the gap between successive convergents is maximized.  To make the following theorems precise we will consider CF( M ), the set of restricted continued fractions whose values lie in the open interval (0, 1) and whose partial denominators are bounded by a positive integer M – that is,        CF   (  M  )    =   {   [  0  ;   a  1   ,   a  2   ,   a  3   ,  …  ]   :   1  ≤   a  i   ≤  M   }    .        CF  M    conditional-set   0   subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2    subscript  a  3   normal-…       1   subscript  a  i        M       \mathrm{CF}(M)=\{[0;a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\dots]:1\leq a_{i}\leq M\}.\,     By making an argument parallel to the one used to construct the Cantor set two interesting results can be obtained.   If M ≥ 4, then any real number in an interval can be constructed as the sum of two elements from CF( M ), where the interval is given by          (2\times[0;\overline{M,1}], 2\times[0;\overline{1,M}]) = \left(\frac{1}{M} \left[\sqrt{M^2 + 4M} - M \right], \sqrt{M^2 + 4M} - M \right).   A simple argument shows that      [  0  ;    1  ,  M   ¯   ]   -   [  0  ;    M  ,  1   ¯   ]    ≥    1  2           0   normal-¯   1  M      0   normal-¯   M  1        1  2     {\scriptstyle[0;\overline{1,M}]-[0;\overline{M,1}]\geq\frac{1}{2}}   holds when M ≥ 4, and this in turn implies that if M ≥ 4, every real number can be represented in the form n + CF 1 + CF 2 , where n is an integer, and CF 1 and CF 2 are elements of CF( M ). 3   Zaremba's conjecture  Zaremba has conjectured the existence of an absolute constant A , such that the rationals with partial quotients restricted by A contain at least one for every (positive integer) denominator. The choice A = 5 is compatible with the numerical evidence. 4 Further conjectures reduce that value, in the case of all sufficiently large denominators. 5  Jean Bourgain and Alex Kontorovich have shown that A can be chosen so that the conclusion holds for a set of denominators of density 1. 6  See also   Markov spectrum   References  "  Category:Continued fractions  Category:Diophantine approximation     ↩  For a fuller explanation of the K notation used here, please see this article . ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
