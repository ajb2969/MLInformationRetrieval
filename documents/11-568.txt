   Trehalose-phosphatase      Trehalose-phosphatase   In enzymology , a trehalose-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   alpha,alpha-trehalose 6-phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   alpha,alpha-trehalose + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are alpha,alpha'-trehalose 6-phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are alpha,alpha-trehalose and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha,alpha-trehalose-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include trehalose 6-phosphatase , trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase , and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase . This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 3.1.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
