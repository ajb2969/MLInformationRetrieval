Trehalose-phosphatase

In enzymology, a trehalose-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

alpha,alpha-trehalose 6-phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  alpha,alpha-trehalose + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are alpha,alpha'-trehalose 6-phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are alpha,alpha-trehalose and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha,alpha-trehalose-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include trehalose 6-phosphatase, trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase, and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase. This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism.
