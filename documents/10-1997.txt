Phenylalanine decarboxylase

In enzymology, a phenylalanine decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-phenylalanine 
 
 
 
  phenylethylamine + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-phenylalanine, and two products, phenylethylamine and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-phenylalanine carboxy-lyase (phenylethylamine-forming). Other names in common use include L-phenylalanine decarboxylase, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, and L-phenylalanine carboxy-lyase. This enzyme participates in phenylalanine metabolism. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
