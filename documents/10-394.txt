Lommel function




Lommel function

  The Lommel differential equation is an inhomogeneous form of the Bessel differential equation:



Two solutions are given by the Lommel functions sμ,ν(z) and Sμ,ν(z), introduced by ,






where Jν(z) is a Bessel function of the first kind, and Yν(z) a Bessel function of the second kind.
