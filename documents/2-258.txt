   Euler's criterion      Euler's criterion   In number theory  Euler's criterion is a formula for determining whether an integer is a quadratic residue  modulo a prime . Precisely,  Let p be an odd prime and a an integer coprime to p . Then 1       a     p  -  1   2     ≡   {      1     (   mod  p   )        if there is an integer  x  such that  a   ≡    x  2      (   mod  p   )           -  1      (   mod  p   )      if there is no such integer.           superscript  a      p  1   2     cases   annotated  1   pmod  p        if there is an integer  x  such that  a    annotated   superscript  x  2    pmod  p      annotated    1    pmod  p    if there is no such integer.     a^{\tfrac{p-1}{2}}\equiv\begin{cases}\;\;\,1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)&\text{ %
 if there is an integer }x\text{ such that }a\equiv x^{2}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}%
 }p)\\
 -1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)&\text{ if there is no such integer.}\end{cases}     Euler's criterion can be concisely reformulated using the Legendre symbol : 2        (   a  p   )   ≡    a    (   p  -  1   )   /  2       (   mod  p   )     .        a  p    annotated   superscript  a      p  1   2     pmod  p      \left(\frac{a}{p}\right)\equiv a^{(p-1)/2}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p).     The criterion first appeared in a 1748 paper by Euler . 3  Proof  The proof uses fact that the residue classes modulo a prime number are a field . See the article prime field for more details. The fact that there are ( p − 1)/2 quadratic residues and the same number of nonresidues (mod p ) is proved in the article quadratic residue .  Fermat's little theorem says that       a   p  -  1    ≡   1     (   mod  p   )         superscript  a    p  1     annotated  1   pmod  p      a^{p-1}\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)   (Assume throughout this solution that a is not 0 mod p). This can be written as         (    a     p  -  1   2     -  1   )    (    a     p  -  1   2     +  1   )    ≡   0     (   mod  p   )     .           superscript  a      p  1   2    1      superscript  a      p  1   2    1     annotated  0   pmod  p      (a^{\tfrac{p-1}{2}}-1)(a^{\tfrac{p-1}{2}}+1)\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p).   Since the integers mod p form a field, one or the other of these factors must be congruent to zero.  Now if a is a quadratic residue, a ≡ x 2 ,        a     p  -  1   2     ≡   x   2      p  -  1   2     ≡   x   p  -  1    ≡   1     (   mod  p   )     .         superscript  a      p  1   2     superscript   superscript  x  2       p  1   2          superscript  x    p  1          annotated  1   pmod  p       a^{\tfrac{p-1}{2}}\equiv{x^{2}}^{\tfrac{p-1}{2}}\equiv x^{p-1}\equiv 1\;\;(%
 \mathop{{\rm mod}}p).   So every quadratic residue (mod p ) makes the first factor zero.  Lagrange's theorem says that there can be no more than ( p − 1)/2 values of a that make the first factor zero. But it is known that there are ( p − 1)/2 distinct quadratic residues (mod p ) (besides 0). Therefore they are precisely the residue classes that make the first factor zero. The other ( p − 1)/2 residue classes, the nonresidues, must be the ones making the second factor zero. This is Euler's criterion.  Examples  Example 1: Finding primes for which a is a residue  Let a = 17. For which primes p is 17 a quadratic residue?  We can test prime p 's manually given the formula above.  In one case, testing p = 3, we have 17 (3 − 1)/2 = 17 1 ≡ 2 ≡ −1 (mod 3), therefore 17 is not a quadratic residue modulo 3.  In another case, testing p = 13, we have 17 (13 − 1)/2 = 17 6 ≡ 1 (mod 13), therefore 17 is a quadratic residue modulo 13. As confirmation, note that 17 ≡ 4 (mod 13), and 2 2 = 4.  We can do these calculations faster by using various modular arithmetic and Legendre symbol properties.  If we keep calculating the values, we find:   (17/ p ) = +1 for p = {13, 19, ...} (17 is a quadratic residue modulo these values)    (17/ p ) = −1 for p = {3, 5, 7, 11, 23, ...} (17 is not a quadratic residue modulo these values).   '''Example 2: Finding residues given a prime modulus p '''  Which numbers are squares modulo 17 (quadratic residues modulo 17)?  We can manually calculate it as:   1 2 = 1  2 2 = 4  3 2 = 9  4 2 = 16  5 2 = 25 ≡ 8 (mod 17)  6 2 = 36 ≡ 2 (mod 17)  7 2 = 49 ≡ 15 (mod 17)  8 2 = 64 ≡ 13 (mod 17).   So the set of the quadratic residues modulo 17 is {1,2,4,8,9,13,15,16}. Note that we did not need to calculate squares for the values 9 through 16, as they are all negatives of the previously squared values (e.g. 9 ≡ −8 (mod 17), so 9 2 ≡ (−8) 2 = 64 ≡ 13 (mod 17)).  We can find quadratic residues or verify them using the above formula. To test if 2 is a quadratic residue modulo 17, we calculate 2 (17 − 1)/2 = 2 8 ≡ 1 (mod 17), so it is a quadratic residue. To test if 3 is a quadratic residue modulo 17, we calculate 3 (17 − 1)/2 = 3 8 ≡ 16 ≡ −1 (mod 17), so it is not a quadratic residue.  Euler's criterion is related to the Law of quadratic reciprocity and is used in a definition of Euler–Jacobi pseudoprimes .
