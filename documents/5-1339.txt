   Qutrit      Qutrit   A qutrit is a unit of quantum information that exists as a superposition of three orthogonal quantum states.  The qutrit is analogous to the classical trit , just as the qubit , a quantum particle of two possible states, is analogous to the classical bit .  Representation  A qutrit has three orthogonal basis states, or vectors , often denoted    |  0  ⟩     ket  0    |0\rangle   ,    |  1  ⟩     ket  1    |1\rangle   , and    |  2  ⟩     ket  2    |2\rangle   in Dirac or bra–ket notation . These are used to describe the qutrit as a superposition in the form of a linear combination of the three states:       |  ψ  ⟩   =    α   |  0  ⟩    +   β   |  1  ⟩    +   γ   |  2  ⟩          ket  ψ       α   ket  0      β   ket  1      γ   ket  2       |\psi\rangle=\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle+\gamma|2\rangle   , where the coefficients are probability amplitudes , such that the sum of their squares is unity:         |  α  |   2   +    |  β  |   2   +    |  γ  |   2    =   1          superscript    α   2    superscript    β   2    superscript    γ   2    1    |\alpha|^{2}+|\beta|^{2}+|\gamma|^{2}=1\,     The qutrit's basis states are orthogonal. Qubits achieve this by utilizing Hilbert space     H  2     subscript  H  2    H_{2}   , corresponding to spin-up and spin-down. Qutrits require a Hilbert space of higher dimension, namely    H  3     subscript  H  3    H_{3}   .  A string of n qutrits represents 3 n different states simultaneously.  Qutrits have several peculiar features when used for storing quantum information. For example, they are more robust to decoherence under certain environmental interactions. 1 In reality, manipulating qutrits directly might be tricky, and one way to do that is by using an entanglement with a qubit . 2  See also   Mutually unbiased bases  Quantum computing  Ternary computing   References  External links   Physicists Demonstrate Qubit-Qutrit Entanglement by Lisa Zyga at Physorg.com , February 26, 2008 .
