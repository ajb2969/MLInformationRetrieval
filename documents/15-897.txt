   Botryococcene synthase      Botryococcene synthase   Botryococcene synthase (, SSL-3 (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name C30 botryococcene:NADP + oxidoreductase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   C30 botryococcene + NADP + + diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   presqualene diphosphate + NADPH + H +    Isolated from the green alga  Botryococcus braunii BOT22.
