   Fréchet manifold      Fréchet manifold   In mathematics , in particular in nonlinear analysis , a Fréchet manifold is a topological space modeled on a Fréchet space in much the same way as a manifold is modeled on a Euclidean space .  More precisely, a Fréchet manifold consists of a Hausdorff space  X with an atlas of coordinate charts over Fréchet spaces whose transitions are smooth mappings . Thus X has an open cover { U α } α ε I , and a collection of homeomorphisms φ α : U α → F α onto their images, where F α are Fréchet spaces, such that         ϕ   α  β    :=      ϕ  α   ∘   ϕ  β   -  1     |     ϕ  β    (    U  β   ∩   U  α    )        assign   subscript  ϕ    α  β     evaluated-at     subscript  ϕ  α    superscript   subscript  ϕ  β     1        subscript  ϕ  β      subscript  U  β    subscript  U  α        \phi_{\alpha\beta}:=\phi_{\alpha}\circ\phi_{\beta}^{-1}|_{\phi_{\beta}(U_{%
 \beta}\cap U_{\alpha})}   is smooth for all pairs of indices α, β.     Classification up to homeomorphism  It is by no means true that a finite-dimensional manifold of dimension n is globally homeomorphic to R n , or even an open subset of R n . However, in an infinite-dimensional setting, it is possible to classify “ well-behaved ” Fréchet manifolds up to homeomorphism quite nicely. A 1969 theorem of David Henderson states that every infinite-dimensional, separable , metric Fréchet manifold X can be embedded as an open subset of the infinite-dimensional, separable Hilbert space , H (up to linear isomorphism, there is only one such space).  The embedding homeomorphism can be used as a global chart for X . Thus, in the infinite-dimensional, separable, metric case, up to homeomorphism, the “only” Fréchet manifolds are the open subsets of Hilbert space.
