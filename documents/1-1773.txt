   Noetherian ring      Noetherian ring   In mathematics , more specifically in the area of abstract algebra known as ring theory , a Noetherian ring is a ring that satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals; that is, given any chain:       I  1   ‚äÜ  ‚ãØ  ‚äÜ   I   k  -  1    ‚äÜ   I  k   ‚äÜ   I   k  +  1    ‚äÜ  ‚ãØ         subscript  I  1   normal-‚ãØ        subscript  I    k  1          subscript  I  k         subscript  I    k  1         normal-‚ãØ     I_{1}\subseteq\cdots\subseteq I_{k-1}\subseteq I_{k}\subseteq I_{k+1}\subseteq\cdots     there exists an n such that:        I  n   =   I   n  +  1    =  ‚ãØ   .         subscript  I  n    subscript  I    n  1         normal-‚ãØ     I_{n}=I_{n+1}=\cdots.     There are other equivalent formulations of the definition of a Noetherian ring and these are outlined later in the article.  Noetherian rings are named after Emmy Noether .  The notion of a Noetherian ring is of fundamental importance in both commutative and noncommutative ring theory, due to the role it plays in simplifying the ideal structure of a ring. For instance, the ring of integers and the polynomial ring over a field are both Noetherian rings, and consequently, such theorems as the Lasker‚ÄìNoether theorem , the Krull intersection theorem , and the Hilbert's basis theorem hold for them. Furthermore, if a ring is Noetherian, then it satisfies the descending chain condition on prime ideals . This property suggests a deep theory of dimension for Noetherian rings beginning with the notion of the Krull dimension .  Characterizations  For noncommutative rings , it is necessary to distinguish between three very similar concepts:   A ring is left-Noetherian if it satisfies the ascending chain condition on left ideals.  A ring is right-Noetherian if it satisfies the ascending chain condition on right ideals.  A ring is Noetherian if it is both left- and right-Noetherian.   For commutative rings , all three concepts coincide, but in general they are different. There are rings that are left-Noetherian and not right-Noetherian, and vice versa.  There are other, equivalent, definitions for a ring R to be left-Noetherian:   Every left ideal I in R is finitely generated , i.e. there exist elements a 1 , ..., a n in I such that I = Ra 1 + ... + Ra n . 1  Every non-empty set of left ideals of R , partially ordered by inclusion, has a maximal element with respect to set inclusion . 2   Similar results hold for right-Noetherian rings.  For a commutative ring to be Noetherian it suffices that every prime ideal of the ring is finitely generated. (The result is due to I. S. Cohen .)  Properties   ‚Ñ§ is a Noetherian ring, a fact which is exploited in the usual proof that every non-unit integer is divisible by at least one prime, although it's usually stated as "every non-empty set of integers has a minimal element with respect to divisibility".  If R is a Noetherian ring, then R [ X ] is Noetherian by the Hilbert basis theorem . By induction, R [ X 1 , ..., X n ] is a Noetherian ring. Also, R [[ X ]], the power series ring is a Noetherian ring.  If R is a Noetherian ring and I is a two-sided ideal, then the factor ring  R / I is also Noetherian. Stated differently, the image of any surjective ring homomorphism of a Noetherian ring is Noetherian.  Every finitely-generated commutative algebra over a commutative Noetherian ring is Noetherian. (This follows from the two previous properties.)  A ring R is left-Noetherian if and only if every finitely generated left R -module is a Noetherian module .  Every localization of a commutative Noetherian ring is Noetherian.  A consequence of the Akizuki-Hopkins-Levitzki Theorem is that every left Artinian ring is left Noetherian. Another consequence is that a left Artinian ring is right Noetherian if and only if right Artinian. The analogous statements with "right" and "left" interchanged are also true.  A left Noetherian ring is left coherent and a left Noetherian domain is a left Ore domain .  A ring is (left/right) Noetherian if and only if every direct sum of injective (left/right) modules is injective. Every injective module can be decomposed as direct sum of indecomposable injective modules.  In a commutative Noetherian ring, there are only finitely many minimal prime ideals .  In a commutative Noetherian domain R , every element can be factorized into irreducible elements . Thus, if, in addition, irreducible elements are prime elements , then R is a unique factorization domain .   Examples   Any field, including fields of rational numbers , real numbers , and complex numbers , is Noetherian. (A field only has two ideals ‚Äî itself and (0).)  Any principal ideal domain , such as the integers , is Noetherian since every ideal is generated by a single element.  A Dedekind domain (e.g., rings of integers ) is Noetherian since every ideal is generated by at most two elements. The "Noetherian" follows from the Krull‚ÄìAkizuki theorem . The bounds on the number of the generators is a corollary of the Forster‚ÄìSwan theorem (or basic ring theory).  The coordinate ring of an affine variety is a Noetherian ring, as a consequence of the Hilbert basis theorem.  The enveloping algebra U of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   is a both left and right noetherian ring; this follows from the fact that the associated graded ring of U is a quotient of    Sym   (  ùî§  )      Sym  ùî§    \operatorname{Sym}(\mathfrak{g})   , which is a polynomial ring over a field; thus, noetherian. 3  The ring of polynomials in finitely-many variables over the integers or a field.   Rings that are not Noetherian tend to be (in some sense) very large. Here are three examples of non-Noetherian rings:   The ring of polynomials in infinitely-many variables, X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , etc. The sequence of ideals ( X 1 ), ( X 1 , X 2 ), ( X 1 , X 2 , X 3 ), etc. is ascending, and does not terminate.  The ring of algebraic integers is not Noetherian. For example, it contains the infinite ascending chain of principal ideals: (2), (2 1/2 ), (2 1/4 ), (2 1/8 ), ...  The ring of continuous functions from the real numbers to the real numbers is not Noetherian: Let I n be the ideal of all continuous functions f such that f ( x ) = 0 for all x ‚â• n . The sequence of ideals I 0 , I 1 , I 2 , etc., is an ascending chain that does not terminate.   However, a non-Noetherian ring can be a subring of a Noetherian ring. Since any integral domain is a subring of a field, any integral domain that is not Noetherian provides an example. To give a less trivial example,   The ring of rational functions generated by x and y / x n over a field k is a subring of the field k ( x , y ) in only two variables.   Indeed, there are rings that are right Noetherian, but not left Noetherian, so that one must be careful in measuring the "size" of a ring this way. For example, if L is a subgroup of Q 2 isomorphic to Z , let R be the ring of homomorphisms f from Q 2 to itself satisfying f ( L ) ‚äÇ L . Choosing a basis, we can describe the same ring R as       R  =   {    [     a    Œ≤      0    Œ≥     ]    |    a  ‚àà  ‚Ñ§   ,    Œ≤  ‚àà  ‚Ñö   ,   Œ≥  ‚àà  ‚Ñö     }    .      R   conditional-set    a  Œ≤    0  Œ≥     formulae-sequence    a  ‚Ñ§    formulae-sequence    Œ≤  ‚Ñö     Œ≥  ‚Ñö        R=\left\{\left.\begin{bmatrix}a&\beta\\
 0&\gamma\end{bmatrix}\,\right|\,a\in\mathbb{Z},\beta\in\mathbb{Q},\gamma\in%
 \mathbb{Q}\right\}.   This ring is right Noetherian, but not left Noetherian; the subset I ‚äÇ R consisting of elements with a =0 and Œ≥ =0 is a left ideal that is not finitely generated as a left R -module.  If R is a commutative subring of a left Noetherian ring S , and S is finitely generated as a left R -module, then R is Noetherian. 4 (In the special case when S is commutative, this is known as Eakin's theorem.) However this is not true if R is not commutative: the ring R of the previous paragraph is a subring of the left Noetherian ring S = Hom( Q 2 , Q 2 ), and S is finitely generated as a left R -module, but R is not left Noetherian.  A unique factorization domain is not necessarily a noetherian ring. It does satisfy a weaker condition: the ascending chain condition on principal ideals .  A valuation ring is not Noetherian unless it is a principal ideal domain. It gives an example of a ring that arises naturally in algebraic geometry but is not Noetherian.  Primary decomposition  In the ring Z of integers, an arbitrary ideal is of the form ( n ) for some integer n (where ( n ) denotes the set of all integer multiples of n ). If n is non-zero, and is neither 1 nor ‚àí1, by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic , there exist primes p i , and positive integers e i , with    n  =    ‚àè  i    p  i     e  i         n    subscript  product  i    superscript   subscript  p  i    subscript  e  i       n=\prod_{i}{p_{i}}^{e_{i}}   . In this case, the ideal ( n ) may be written as the intersection of the ideals ( p i e i ); that is,     (  n  )   =    ‚à©  i    (   p  i     e  i    )        n    subscript   i    superscript   subscript  p  i    subscript  e  i       (n)=\cap_{i}({p_{i}}^{e_{i}})   . This is referred to as a primary decomposition of the ideal ( n ).  In general, an ideal Q of a ring is said to be primary if Q is proper and whenever xy ‚àà Q , either x ‚àà Q or y n ‚àà Q for some positive integer n . In Z , the primary ideals are precisely the ideals of the form ( p e ) where p is prime and e is a positive integer. Thus, a primary decomposition of ( n ) corresponds to representing ( n ) as the intersection of finitely many primary ideals.  Since the fundamental theorem of arithmetic applied to a non-zero integer n that is neither 1 nor ‚àí1 also asserts uniqueness of the representation    n  =    ‚àè  i    p  i     e  i         n    subscript  product  i    superscript   subscript  p  i    subscript  e  i       n=\prod_{i}{p_{i}}^{e_{i}}   for p i prime and e i positive, a primary decomposition of ( n ) is essentially unique .  For all of the above reasons, the following theorem, referred to as the Lasker‚ÄìNoether theorem , may be seen as a certain generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic:   Lasker-Noether Theorem. Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring and let I be an ideal of R . Then I may be written as the intersection of finitely many primary ideals with distinct radicals ; that is:      I  =    ‚ãÇ   i  =  1   t    Q  i        I    superscript   subscript     i  1    t    subscript  Q  i      I=\bigcap_{i=1}^{t}Q_{i}     with Q i primary for all i and Rad( Q i ) ‚â† Rad( Q j ) for i ‚â† j . Furthermore, if:      I  =    ‚ãÇ   i  =  1   k    P  i        I    superscript   subscript     i  1    k    subscript  P  i      I=\bigcap_{i=1}^{k}P_{i}     is decomposition of I with Rad( P i ) ‚â† Rad( P j ) for i ‚â† j , and both decompositions of I are irredundant (meaning that no proper subset of either { Q 1 , ..., Q t } or { P 1 , ..., P k } yields an intersection equal to I ), t = k and (after possibly renumbering the Q i ) Rad( Q i ) = Rad( P i ) for all i .   For any primary decomposition of I , the set of all radicals, that is, the set {Rad( Q 1 ), ..., Rad( Q t )} remains the same by the Lasker‚ÄìNoether theorem. In fact, it turns out that (for a Noetherian ring) the set is precisely the assassinator of the module R / I ; that is, the set of all annihilators of R / I (viewed as a module over R ) that are prime.
