   (acyl-carrier-protein) phosphodiesterase      (acyl-carrier-protein) phosphodiesterase   In enzymology , a [acyl-carrier-protein] phosphodiesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   holo-[acyl-carrier-protein] + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4'-phosphopantetheine + apo-[acyl-carrier-protein]   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are holo-[acyl-carrier-protein ] and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 4'-phosphopantetheine and apo-[acyl-carrier-protein ].  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is holo-[acyl-carrier-protein] 4'-pantetheine-phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include ACP hydrolyase , ACP phosphodiesterase , AcpH , and [acyl-carrier-protein] 4'-pantetheine-phosphohydrolase . This enzyme participates in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis.  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
