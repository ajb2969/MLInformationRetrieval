Epi-cedrol synthase

Epi-cedrol synthase (, 8-epicedrol synthase, epicedrol synthase) is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (8-epi-cedrol-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  8-epi-cedrol + diphosphate


This enzyme is activated by Mg2+.
