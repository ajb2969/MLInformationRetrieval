Goldstine theorem

In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, the Goldstine theorem, named after Herman Goldstine, is stated as follows:

Goldstine Theorem. Let 
 
 
 
  be a Banach space, then the image of the closed unit ball 
 
 
 
  under the canonical imbedding into the closed unit ball 
 
 
 
  of the bidual space

 
  is weakly*-dense.
 

The conclusion of the theorem is not true for the norm topology, which can be seen by considering the Banach space of real sequences that converge to zero, , and its bi-dual space .
Proof
Given 
 
 
 
 , an 
 
 
 
 -tuple  of linearly independent elements of 
 
 
 
  and a 
 
 
 
  we shall find 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that  x′′(φi)}} for 
 
 
 
 .
If the requirement 
 
 
 
  is dropped, the existence of such an 
 
 
 
  follows from the surjectivity of



Now let



Every element of 
 
 
 
  has the required property, so that it suffices to show that the latter set is not empty.
Assume that it is empty. Then 
 
 
 
  and by the Hahn-Banach theorem there exists a linear form 
 
 
 
  such that Y {{=}} 0, φ(x) ≥ 1 + δ}} and φ{{!!}}X ′ {{=}} 1}}. Then  and therefore



which is a contradiction.
