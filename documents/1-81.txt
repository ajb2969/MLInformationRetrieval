   Algebraic closure      Algebraic closure   In mathematics , particularly abstract algebra , an algebraic closure of a field  K is an algebraic extension of K that is algebraically closed . It is one of many closures in mathematics.  Using Zorn's lemma , it can be shown that every field has an algebraic closure , 1 2 3 and that the algebraic closure of a field K is unique up to an isomorphism that fixes every member of K . Because of this essential uniqueness, we often speak of the algebraic closure of K , rather than an algebraic closure of K .  The algebraic closure of a field K can be thought of as the largest algebraic extension of K . To see this, note that if L is any algebraic extension of K , then the algebraic closure of L is also an algebraic closure of K , and so L is contained within the algebraic closure of K . The algebraic closure of K is also the smallest algebraically closed field containing K , because if M is any algebraically closed field containing K , then the elements of M that are algebraic over  K form an algebraic closure of K .  The algebraic closure of a field K has the same cardinality as K if K is infinite, and is countably infinite if K is finite. 4  Examples   The fundamental theorem of algebra states that the algebraic closure of the field of real numbers is the field of complex numbers .    The algebraic closure of the field of rational numbers is the field of algebraic numbers .    There are many countable algebraically closed fields within the complex numbers, and strictly containing the field of algebraic numbers; these are the algebraic closures of transcendental extensions of the rational numbers, e.g. the algebraic closure of Q (π).    For a finite field of prime power order q , the algebraic closure is a countably infinite field that contains a copy of the field of order q n for each positive integer  n (and is in fact the union of these copies). 5   Existence of an algebraic closure and splitting fields  Let    S  =   {   f  λ   |   λ  ∈  Λ   }       S   conditional-set   subscript  f  λ     λ  normal-Λ      S=\{f_{\lambda}|\lambda\in\Lambda\}   be the set of all monic irreducible polynomials in K [ x ]. For each     f  λ   ∈  S       subscript  f  λ   S    f_{\lambda}\in S   , introduce new variables     u   λ  ,  1    ,  …  ,   u   λ  ,  d        subscript  u   λ  1    normal-…   subscript  u   λ  d      u_{\lambda,1},\ldots,u_{\lambda,d}   where    d  =   degree   (   f  λ   )        d    degree   subscript  f  λ      d={\rm degree}(f_{\lambda})   . Let R be the polynomial ring over K generated by    u   λ  ,  i      subscript  u   λ  i     u_{\lambda,i}   for all    λ  ∈  Λ      λ  normal-Λ    \lambda\in\Lambda   and all    i  ≤   degree   (   f  λ   )        i    degree   subscript  f  λ      i\leq{\rm degree}(f_{\lambda})   . Write        f  λ   -    ∏   i  =  1   d    (   x  -   u   λ  ,  i     )     =    ∑   j  =  0    d  -  1      r   λ  ,  j    ⋅   x  j     ∈   R   [  x  ]             subscript  f  λ     superscript   subscript  product    i  1    d     x   subscript  u   λ  i         superscript   subscript     j  0      d  1     normal-⋅   subscript  r   λ  j     superscript  x  j            R   delimited-[]  x       f_{\lambda}-\prod_{i=1}^{d}(x-u_{\lambda,i})=\sum_{j=0}^{d-1}r_{\lambda,j}%
 \cdot x^{j}\in R[x]     with     r   λ  ,  j    ∈  R       subscript  r   λ  j    R    r_{\lambda,j}\in R   . Let I be the ideal in R generated by the    r   λ  ,  j      subscript  r   λ  j     r_{\lambda,j}   . By Zorn's lemma, there exists a maximal ideal M in R that contains I . Now R / M is an algebraic closure of K ; every    f  λ     subscript  f  λ    f_{\lambda}   splits as the product of the    x  -   (    u   λ  ,  i    +  M   )       x     subscript  u   λ  i    M     x-(u_{\lambda,i}+M)   .  The same proof also shows that for any subset S of K [ x ], there exists a splitting field of S over K .  Separable closure  An algebraic closure K alg of K contains a unique separable extension  K sep of K containing all (algebraic) separable extensions of K within K alg . This subextension is called a separable closure of K . Since a separable extension of a separable extension is again separable, there are no finite separable extensions of K sep , of degree > 1. Saying this another way, K is contained in a separably-closed algebraic extension field. It is essentially unique ( up to isomorphism). 6  The separable closure is the full algebraic closure if and only if K is a perfect field . For example, if K is a field of characteristic p and if X is transcendental over K ,     K   (  X  )    (   X  p   )    ⊃   K   (  X  )          K  X     K  X     p   X      K(X)(\sqrt[p]{X})\supset K(X)   is a non-separable algebraic field extension.  In general, the absolute Galois group of K is the Galois group of K sep over K . 7  See also   Algebraically closed field  Algebraic extension  Puiseux expansion   References      "  Category:Field extensions     McCarthy (1991) p.21 ↩  M.
