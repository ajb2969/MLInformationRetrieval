   Mapping cone (topology)      Mapping cone (topology)   In mathematics , especially homotopy theory , the mapping cone is a construction    C  f     subscript  C  f    C_{f}   of topology , analogous to a quotient space . It is also called the homotopy cofiber, and also notated    C  f      C  f    Cf   .  Definition  Given a map     f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f\colon X\to Y   , the mapping cone    C  f     subscript  C  f    C_{f}   is defined to be the quotient topological space of     (   X  ×  I   )   ⊔  Y     square-union    X  I   Y    (X\times I)\sqcup Y   with respect to the equivalence relation     (  x  ,  0  )   ∼   (   x  ′   ,  0  )      similar-to   x  0     superscript  x  normal-′   0     (x,0)\sim(x^{\prime},0)\,   ,     (  x  ,  1  )   ∼   f   (  x  )       similar-to   x  1     f  x     (x,1)\sim f(x)\,   on X . Here   I   I   I   denotes the unit interval [0,1] with its standard topology. Note that some (like May) use the opposite convention, switching 0 and 1.  Visually, one takes the cone on X (the cylinder    X  ×  I      X  I    X\times I   with one end (the 0 end) identified to a point), and glues the other end onto Y via the map f (the identification of the 1 end).  Coarsely, one is taking the quotient space by the image of X, so Cf "=" Y / f ( X ); this is not precisely correct because of point-set issues, but is the philosophy, and is made precise by such results as the homology of a pair and the notion of an n -connected map.  The above is the definition for a map of unpointed spaces; for a map of pointed spaces     f  :    (  X  ,   x  0   )   →   (  Y  ,   y  0   )     ,     normal-:  f   normal-→   X   subscript  x  0     Y   subscript  y  0       f\colon(X,x_{0})\to(Y,y_{0}),   (so    f  :    x  0   ↦   y  0       normal-:  f   maps-to   subscript  x  0    subscript  y  0      f\colon x_{0}\mapsto y_{0}   ), one also identifies all of     x  0   ×  I       subscript  x  0   I    {x_{0}}\times I   ; formally,      (   x  0   ,  t  )   ∼   (   x  0   ,   t  ′   )    .     similar-to    subscript  x  0   t     subscript  x  0    superscript  t  normal-′      (x_{0},t)\sim(x_{0},t^{\prime})\,.   Thus one end and the "seam" are all identified with     y  0   .     subscript  y  0    y_{0}.     Example of circle  If   X   X   X   is the circle  S 1 , C f can be considered as the quotient space of the disjoint union of Y with the disk  D 2 formed by identifying a point x on the boundary of D 2 to the point f(x) in Y .  Consider, for example, the case where Y is the disc D 2 , and   f : S 1 → Y = D 2    is the standard inclusion of the circle S 1 as the boundary of D 2 . Then the mapping cone C f is homeomorphic to two disks joined on their boundary, which is topologically the sphere S 2 .  Double mapping cylinder  The mapping cone is a special case of the double mapping cylinder . This is basically a cylinder joined on one end to a space X 1 via the map   f 1 : S 1 → X 1    and joined on the other end to a space X 2 via the map   f 2 : S 1 → X 2 .   The mapping cone is the degenerate case of the double mapping cylinder (also known as the homotopy pushout), in which one space is a single point.  Applications  CW-complexes  Attaching a cell  Effect on fundamental group  Given a space  X and a loop      α  :    S  1   →  X      normal-:  α   normal-→   superscript  S  1   X     \alpha\colon S^{1}\to X     representing an element of the fundamental group of X , we can form the mapping cone C α . The effect of this is to make the loop α  contractible in C α , and therefore the equivalence class of α in the fundamental group of C α will be simply the identity element .  Given a group presentation by generators and relations, one gets a 2-complex with that fundamental group.  Homology of a pair  The mapping cone lets one interpret the homology of a pair as the reduced homology of the quotient:  If E is a homology theory , and    i  :   A  →  X      normal-:  i   normal-→  A  X     i\colon A\to X   is a cofibration , then      E  *    (  X  ,  A  )    =    E  *    (   X  /  A   ,  *  )    =     E  ~   *    (   X  /  A   )             subscript  E     X  A       subscript  E       X  A              subscript   normal-~  E       X  A       E_{*}(X,A)=E_{*}(X/A,*)=\tilde{E}_{*}(X/A)   , which follows by applying excision to the mapping cone. 1  Relation to homotopy (homology) equivalences  A map    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f\colon X\rightarrow Y   between simply-connected CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence if and only if its mapping cone is contractible.  More generally, a map is called n -connected (as a map) if its mapping cone is n -connected (as a space), plus a little more. See A. Hatcher Algebraic Topology .  Let    H  *     subscript  H     \mathbb{}H_{*}   be a fixed homology theory . The map    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\rightarrow Y   induces isomorphisms on    H  *     subscript  H     \mathbb{}H_{*}   , if and only if the map     {  ⋅  }   ↪   C  f      normal-↪   normal-⋅    subscript  C  f     \{\cdot\}\hookrightarrow C_{f}   induces an isomorphism on    H  *     subscript  H     \mathbb{}H_{*}   , i.e.      H  *    (   C  f   ,   p  t   )    =  0         subscript  H      subscript  C  f     p  t     0    \mathbb{}H_{*}(C_{f},pt)=0   .
