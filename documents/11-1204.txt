Alpha,alpha-trehalose phosphorylase




Alpha,alpha-trehalose phosphorylase

In enzymology, an alpha,alpha-trehalose phosphorylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

alpha,alpha-trehalose + phosphate 
 
 
 
  D-glucose + beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are trehalose and phosphate, whereas its two products are D-glucose and beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha,alpha-trehalose:phosphate beta-D-glucosyltransferase. This enzyme is also called trehalose phosphorylase. This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism.
