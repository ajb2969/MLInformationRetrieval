   Borel–Carathéodory theorem      Borel–Carathéodory theorem   In mathematics , the Borel–Carathéodory theorem in complex analysis shows that an analytic function may be bounded by its real part . It is an application of the maximum modulus principle . It is named for Émile Borel and Constantin Carathéodory .  Statement of the theorem  Let a function   f   f   f   be analytic on a closed disc of radius  R centered at the origin . Suppose that r \|f\|_r \le \frac{2r}{R-r} \sup_{|z| \le R} \operatorname{Re} f(z) + \frac{R+r}{R-r} |f(0)|.  Here, the norm on the left-hand side denotes the maximum value of f in the closed disc:        ∥  f  ∥   r   =    max    |  z  |   ≤  r     |   f   (  z  )    |    =    max    |  z  |   =  r     |   f   (  z  )    |           subscript   norm  f   r     subscript       z   r        f  z            subscript       z   r        f  z        \|f\|_{r}=\max_{|z|\leq r}|f(z)|=\max_{|z|=r}|f(z)|     (where the last equality is due to the maximum modulus principle).  Proof  Define A by       A  =    sup    |  z  |   ≤  R      Re  f    (  z  )      .      A    subscript  supremum      z   R       Re  f   z      A=\sup_{|z|\leq R}\operatorname{Re}f(z).     First let f (0) = 0. Since Re f is harmonic, we may take A >0. f maps into the half-plane P to the left of the x = A line. Roughly, our goal is to map this half-plane to a disk, apply Schwarz's lemma there, and tease out the stated inequality.      w  ↦    w  /  A   -  1      maps-to  w      w  A   1     w\mapsto w/A-1   sends P to the standard left half-plane.    w  ↦    R   (   w  +  1   )    /   (   w  -  1   )       maps-to  w      R    w  1      w  1      w\mapsto R(w+1)/(w-1)   sends the left half-plane to the circle of radius R centered at the origin. The composite, which maps 0 to 0, is the desired map:       w  ↦    R  w    w  -   2  A      .     maps-to  w      R  w     w    2  A       w\mapsto\frac{Rw}{w-2A}.     From Schwarz's lemma applied to the composite of this map and f , we have         |   R  f   (  z  )    |    |    f   (  z  )    -   2  A    |    ≤   |  z  |    .            R  f  z          f  z     2  A        z     \frac{|Rf(z)|}{|f(z)-2A|}\leq|z|.     Take | z | ≤ r . The above becomes       R   |   f   (  z  )    |    ≤   r   |    f   (  z  )    -   2  A    |    ≤    r   |   f   (  z  )    |    +   2  A  r            R      f  z       r        f  z     2  A               r      f  z       2  A  r       R|f(z)|\leq r|f(z)-2A|\leq r|f(z)|+2Ar     so       |   f   (  z  )    |   ≤    2  A  r    R  -  r            f  z        2  A  r     R  r      |f(z)|\leq\frac{2Ar}{R-r}   ,  as claimed. In the general case, we may apply the above to f ( z )- f (0):       |   f   (  z  )    |   -   |   f   (  0  )    |           f  z        f  0      \displaystyle|f(z)|-|f(0)|     which, when rearranged, gives the claim.
