   Relative canonical model      Relative canonical model   In mathematics , the relative canonical model of a singular variety    X   X   X   is a particular canonical variety that maps to   X   X   X   , which simplifies the structure. The precise definition is:  If    f  :   Y  →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→  Y  X     f:Y\to X   is a resolution define the adjunction sequence to be the sequence of subsheaves      f  *    ω  Y    ⊗  n     ;       subscript  f     superscript   subscript  ω  Y    tensor-product  absent  n      f_{*}\omega_{Y}^{\otimes n};   if    ω  X     subscript  ω  X    \omega_{X}   is invertible      f  *    ω  Y    ⊗  n     =    I  n    ω  X    ⊗  n            subscript  f     superscript   subscript  ω  Y    tensor-product  absent  n        subscript  I  n    superscript   subscript  ω  X    tensor-product  absent  n       f_{*}\omega_{Y}^{\otimes n}=I_{n}\omega_{X}^{\otimes n}   where    I  n     subscript  I  n    I_{n}   is the higher adjunction ideal. Problem. Is     ⊕  n     f  *    ω  Y    ⊗  n         subscript  direct-sum  n      subscript  f     superscript   subscript  ω  Y    tensor-product  absent  n       \oplus_{n}f_{*}\omega_{Y}^{\otimes n}   finitely generated? If this is true then      P  r  o  j    ⊕  n     f  *    ω  Y    ⊗  n      →  X     normal-→    subscript  direct-sum  n     P  r  o  j      subscript  f     superscript   subscript  ω  Y    tensor-product  absent  n      X    Proj\oplus_{n}f_{*}\omega_{Y}^{\otimes n}\to X   is called the relative canonical model of   Y   Y   Y   , or the canonical blow-up of   X   X   X   . 1  Some basic properties were as follows: The relative canonical model was independent of the choice of resolution. Some integer multiple   r   r   r   of the canonical divisor of the relative canonical model was Cartier and the number of exceptional components where this agrees with the same multiple of the canonical divisor of Y is also independent of the choice of Y. When it equals the number of components of Y it was called crepant . 2 It was not known whether relative canonical models were Cohen–Macaulay .  Because the relative canonical model is independent of   Y   Y   Y   , most authors simplify the terminology, referring to it as the relative canonical model ''of ''   X   X   X   rather than either the relative canonical model ''of ''   Y   Y   Y   or the canonical blow-up of   X   X   X   . The class of varieties that are relative canonical models have canonical singularities . Since that time in the 1970s other mathematicians solved affirmatively the problem of whether they are Cohen–Macaulay . The minimal model program started by Shigefumi Mori proved that the sheaf in the definition always is finitely generated and therefore that relative canonical models always exist.
