   Relativistic similarity parameter      Relativistic similarity parameter   In relativistic laser-plasma physics the relativistic similarity parameter  S is a dimensionless parameter defined as      S  =    n  e     a  0    n   c  r          S     subscript  n  e      subscript  a  0    subscript  n    c  r        S=\frac{n_{e}}{a_{0}n_{cr}}   ,  where    n  e     subscript  n  e    {n_{e}}   is the electron plasma density,     n   c  r    =      m  e    ω  0  2    /  4   π   e  2         subscript  n    c  r           subscript  m  e    superscript   subscript  ω  0   2    4   π   superscript  e  2      {n_{cr}=m_{e}\omega_{0}^{2}/4\pi e^{2}}   is the critical plasma density and     a  0   =     e  A   /   m  e     c  2         subscript  a  0         e  A    subscript  m  e     superscript  c  2      {a_{0}=eA/m_{e}c^{2}}   is the normalized vector potential. Here    m  e     subscript  m  e    {m_{e}}   is the electron mass ,   e   e   {e}   is the electron charge,   c   c   {c}   is the speed of light and    ω  0     subscript  ω  0    {\omega_{0}}   is the laser frequency. Note that CGS units were used above.  The concept of similarity and the similarity parameter   S   S   {S}   were first introduced in plasma physics by Sergey Gordienko. 1 It allows distinguishing between relativistically overdense    (   S  ≫  1   )     much-greater-than  S  1    {(S\gg 1)}   and underdense plasmas    (   S  ≪  1   )     much-less-than  S  1    {(S\ll 1)}   .  The similarity parameter is connected to basic symmetry properties of the collisionless Vlasov equation and is thus the relativistic plasma analog of the Reynolds number in fluid mechanics . Gordienko showed that in the relativistic limit (     a  0   ≫  1     much-greater-than   subscript  a  0   1    {a_{0}\gg 1}   ) the laser-plasma dynamics depends on three dimensionless parameters     ω  0   τ       subscript  ω  0   τ    \omega_{0}\tau   ,     R   ω  0    /  c        R   subscript  ω  0    c    {R\omega_{0}/c}   and   S   S   {S}   , where   τ   τ   {\tau}   is the duration of the laser pulse and   R   R   {R}   is the typical radius of the laser waist . The main result of the relativistic similarity theory can be summarized as follows: if the parameters of the interaction (plasma density and laser amplitude) change simultaneously so that the   S   S   {S}   parameter remains constant, the dynamics of the electrons remains the same.  The similarity theory allows deriving non-trivial power-law scalings for the energy of fast electrons in underdense and overdense plasmas. 2  References  External links  "  Category:Plasma physics     ↩  ↩
