   Zero set      Zero set   In mathematics , the zero set of a real-valued function  f : X → R (or more generally, a function taking values in some additive group ) is the subset      f   -  1     (  0  )        superscript  f    1    0    f^{-1}(0)   of X (the inverse image of {0}). In other words, the zero set of the function f is the subset of X on which     f   (  x  )    =  0        f  x   0    f(x)=0   . The cozero set of f is the complement of the zero set of f (i.e. the subset of X on which f is nonzero).  Zero sets are important in several branches of geometry and topology.  Topology  In topology , zero sets are defined with respect to continuous functions . Let X be a topological space , and let A be a subset of X . Then A is a zero set in X if there exists a continuous function f : X → R such that       A  =    f   -  1     (  0  )     .      A     superscript  f    1    0     A=f^{-1}(0).\,   A cozero set in X is a subset whose complement is a zero set.  Every zero set is a closed set and a cozero set is an open set , but the converses does not always hold. In fact:   A topological space X is completely regular if and only if every closed set is the intersection of a family of zero sets in X . Equivalently, X is completely regular if and only if the cozero sets form a basis for X .  A topological space is perfectly normal if and only if every closed set is a zero set (equivalently, every open set is a cozero set).   Differential geometry  In differential geometry , zero sets are frequently used to define manifolds . An important special case is the case that f is a smooth function from R p to R n . If zero is a regular value of f then the zero-set of f is a smooth manifold of dimension m = p - n by the regular value theorem .  For example, the unit m - sphere in R m +1 is the zero set of the real-valued function f ( x ) = |x| 2 - 1.  An unrelated but important result in analysis and geometry states that any closed subset of R n is the zero set of a smooth function defined on all of R n . In fact, this result extends to any smooth manifold , as a corollary of paracompactness .  Algebraic geometry  In algebraic geometry , an affine variety is the zero set of a polynomial , or collection of polynomials. Similarly, a projective variety is the projectivization of the zero set of a collection of homogeneous polynomials .
