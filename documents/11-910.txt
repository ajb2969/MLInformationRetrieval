   Glucarate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase      Glucarate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase   In enzymology , a glucarate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   sinapoyl-CoA + glucarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + O-sinapoylglucarate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sinapoyl-CoA and glucarate , whereas its two products are CoA and O-sinapoylglucarate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sinapoyl-CoA:glucarate O-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
