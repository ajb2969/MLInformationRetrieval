   Preparata code      Preparata code   In coding theory , the Preparata codes form a class of non-linear double- error-correcting codes . They are named after Franco P. Preparata who first described them in 1968.  Although non-linear over GF(2) the Preparata codes are linear over Z 4 with the Lee distance .  Construction  Let m be an odd number, and    n  =    2  m   -  1       n     superscript  2  m   1     n=2^{m}-1   . We first describe the extended Preparata code of length      2  n   +  2   =   2   m  +  1            2  n   2    superscript  2    m  1      2n+2=2^{m+1}   : the Preparata code is then derived by deleting one position. The words of the extended code are regarded as pairs ( X , Y ) of 2 m -tuples, each corresponding to subsets of the finite field GF(2 m ) in some fixed way.  The extended code contains the words ( X , Y ) satisfying three conditions   X , Y each have even weight;         ∑   x  ∈  X    x   =    ∑   y  ∈  Y    y    ;        subscript     x  X    x     subscript     y  Y    y     \sum_{x\in X}x=\sum_{y\in Y}y;             ∑   x  ∈  X     x  3    +    (    ∑   x  ∈  X    x   )   3    =    ∑   y  ∈  Y     y  3     .          subscript     x  X     superscript  x  3     superscript    subscript     x  X    x   3      subscript     y  Y     superscript  y  3      \sum_{x\in X}x^{3}+\left(\sum_{x\in X}x\right)^{3}=\sum_{y\in Y}y^{3}.      The Peparata code is obtained by deleting the position in X corresponding to 0 in GF(2 m ).  Properties  The Preparata code is of length 2 m +1 − 1, size 2 k where k = 2 m + 1 − 2 m − 2, and minimum distance 5.  When m = 3, the Preparata code of length 15 is also called the Nordstrom–Robinson code .
