Preparata code

In coding theory, the Preparata codes form a class of non-linear double-error-correcting codes. They are named after Franco P. Preparata who first described them in 1968.
Although non-linear over GF(2) the Preparata codes are linear over Z4 with the Lee distance.
Construction
Let m be an odd number, and 
 
 
 
 . We first describe the extended Preparata code of length 
 
 
 
 : the Preparata code is then derived by deleting one position. The words of the extended code are regarded as pairs (X, Y) of 2m-tuples, each corresponding to subsets of the finite field GF(2m) in some fixed way.
The extended code contains the words (X, Y) satisfying three conditions

X, Y each have even weight;







The Peparata code is obtained by deleting the position in X corresponding to 0 in GF(2m).
Properties
The Preparata code is of length 2m+1 − 1, size 2k where k = 2m + 1 − 2m − 2, and minimum distance 5.
When m = 3, the Preparata code of length 15 is also called the Nordstrom–Robinson code.
