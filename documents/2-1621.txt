   Flexible AC transmission system      Flexible AC transmission system   A flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) is a system composed of static equipment used for the AC  transmission of electrical energy . It is meant to enhance controllability and increase power transfer capability of the network. It is generally a power electronics -based system.  FACTS is defined by the IEEE as "a power electronic based system and other static equipment that provide control of one or more AC transmission system parameters to enhance controllability and increase power transfer capability." 1  According to Siemens "FACTS Increase the reliability of AC grids and reduce power delivery costs. They improve transmission quality and efficiency of power transmission by supplying inductive or reactive power to the grid. 2  Technology    Series compensation  In series compensation, the FACTS is connected in series with the power system. It works as a controllable voltage source. Series inductance exists in all AC transmission lines. On long lines, when a large current flows, this causes a large voltage drop. To compensate, series capacitors are connected, decreasing the effect of the inductance.Also by connecting series capacitors in series with line,the inductive reactance between the receiving end and the sending end will be reduced due to which power factor of the system can be improved. But the effect on power factor is very little when compared to shunt capacitor.  Shunt compensation  In shunt compensation, power system is connected in shunt (parallel) with the FACTS. It works as a controllable current source . Shunt compensation is of two types:   Shunt capacitive compensation: This method is used to improve the power factor . Whenever an inductive load is connected to the transmission line, power factor lags because of lagging load current. To compensate, a shunt capacitor is connected which draws current leading the source voltage . The net result is improvement in power factor.    Shunt inductive compensation: This method is used either when charging the transmission line , or, when there is very low load at the receiving end. Due to very low, or no load – very low current flows through the transmission line. Shunt capacitance in the transmission line causes voltage amplification ( Ferranti effect ). The receiving end voltage may become double the sending end voltage (generally in case of very long transmission lines). To compensate, shunt inductors are connected across the transmission line. The power transfer capability is thereby increased depending upon the power equation       P  =    (    E  V   X   )    sin   (  δ  )         P        E  V   X     δ      P=\left(\frac{EV}{X}\right)\sin(\delta)       δ  =       δ  absent    \delta=   power angle  Theory  In the case of a no-loss line, voltage magnitude at the receiving end is the same as voltage magnitude at the sending end: V s = V r =V. Transmission results in a phase lag   δ   δ   \delta   that depends on line reactance X.          V  s   ¯       =    V   cos   (    δ  2    )     +   j  V   sin   (    δ  2    )             V  r   ¯       =    V   cos   (    δ  2    )     -   j  V   sin   (    δ  2    )            I  ¯       =       V  s   ¯   -    V  r   ¯     j  X     =     2  V   sin   (   δ  2   )     X            normal-¯   subscript  V  s      absent      V      δ  2       j  V      δ  2          normal-¯   subscript  V  r      absent      V      δ  2       j  V      δ  2          normal-¯  I       absent       normal-¯   subscript  V  s     normal-¯   subscript  V  r       j  X             2  V      δ  2     X        \begin{aligned}\displaystyle\underline{V_{s}}&\displaystyle=V\cos\left(\frac{%
 \delta}{2}\right)+jV\sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\\
 \displaystyle\underline{V_{r}}&\displaystyle=V\cos\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right%

 \displaystyle\underline{I}&\displaystyle=\frac{\underline{V_{s}}-\underline{V_%
 {r}}}{jX}=\frac{2V\sin{\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)}}{X}\end{aligned}     As it is a no-loss line, active power P is the same at any point of the line:       P  s   =   P  r   =  P  =    V   cos   (   δ  2   )     ⋅    2  V   sin   (   δ  2   )     X    =     V  2   X    sin   (  δ  )            subscript  P  s    subscript  P  r        P        normal-⋅    V      δ  2         2  V      δ  2     X              superscript  V  2   X     δ       P_{s}=P_{r}=P=V\cos\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\cdot\frac{2V\sin{\left(\frac{%
 \delta}{2}\right)}}{X}=\frac{V^{2}}{X}\sin(\delta)     Reactive power at sending end is the opposite of reactive power at receiving end:       Q  s   =   -   Q  r    =  Q  =    V   sin   (   δ  2   )     ⋅    2  V   sin   (   δ  2   )     X    =     V  2   X    (   1  -   cos  δ    )           subscript  Q  s      subscript  Q  r         Q        normal-⋅    V      δ  2         2  V      δ  2     X              superscript  V  2   X     1    δ        Q_{s}=-Q_{r}=Q=V\sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\cdot\frac{2V\sin\left(\frac{%
 \delta}{2}\right)}{X}=\frac{V^{2}}{X}(1-\cos\delta)     As   δ   δ   \delta   is very small, active power mainly depends on   δ   δ   \delta   whereas reactive power mainly depends on voltage magnitude.  Series compensation  FACTS for series compensation modify line impedance: X is decreased so as to increase the transmittable active power. However, more reactive power must be provided.       P      =      V  2    X  -   X  c       sin   (  δ  )          Q      =      V  2    X  -   X  c       (   1  -   cos  δ    )           P    absent       superscript  V  2     X    X  c       δ       Q    absent       superscript  V  2     X    X  c       1    δ         \begin{aligned}\displaystyle P&\displaystyle=\frac{V^{2}}{X-Xc}\sin(\delta)\\
 \displaystyle Q&\displaystyle=\frac{V^{2}}{X-Xc}(1-\cos\delta)\end{aligned}     Shunt compensation  Reactive current is injected into the line to maintain voltage magnitude. Transmittable active power is increased but more reactive power is to be provided.       P      =      2   V  2    X     sin   (    δ  2    )          Q      =      4   V  2    X     [   1  -   cos   (     δ  /  2   2    )     ]           P    absent        2   superscript  V  2    X       δ  2        Q    absent        4   superscript  V  2    X    delimited-[]    1        δ  2   2           \begin{aligned}\displaystyle P&\displaystyle=\frac{2V^{2}}{X}\sin\left(\frac{%
 \delta}{2}\right)\\
 \displaystyle Q&\displaystyle=\frac{4V^{2}}{X}\left[1-\cos\left(\frac{\delta/2%
