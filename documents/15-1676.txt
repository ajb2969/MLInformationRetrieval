   Quadratic Frobenius test      Quadratic Frobenius test   The quadratic Frobenius test ( QFT ) is a probabilistic  primality test to test whether a number is a probable prime . It is named after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius . The test uses the concepts of quadratic polynomials and the Frobenius automorphism . A composite passing this test is called a Frobenius pseudoprime .  Concept  Grantham's stated goal when developing the algorithm was to provide a test that primes would always pass and composites would pass with a probability of less than 1/7710. 1  The test was later extended by Damgård and Frandsen to a test called extended quadratic Frobenius test (EQFT). 2  Algorithm  Let n be a positive integer such that n is odd, ( b 2 + 4 c | n ) = −1 and (− c | n ) = 1, where ( x | n ) denotes the Jacobi symbol . Set B = 50000. Then a QFT on n with parameters ( b , c ) works as follows:   (1) Test whether one of the primes less than or equal to the lower of the two values   B   B   B   and    n      n    \sqrt{n}   divides n . If yes, then stop as n is composite.  (2) Test whether     n   ∈  ℤ        n   ℤ    \sqrt{n}\in\mathbb{Z}   . If yes, then stop as n is composite.  (3) Compute      x    n  +  1   2     mod   (  n  ,    x  2   -   b  x   -  c   )      modulo   superscript  x      n  1   2     n     superscript  x  2     b  x   c      x^{n+1\over 2}\,\bmod\,\big(n,x^{2}-bx-c)   . If     x    n  +  1   2    ∉    ℤ  /  n   ℤ        superscript  x      n  1   2        ℤ  n   ℤ     x^{n+1\over 2}\notin\mathbb{Z}\big/n\mathbb{Z}   then stop as n is composite.  (4) Compute      x   n  +  1     mod   (  n  ,    x  2   -   b  x   -  c   )      modulo   superscript  x    n  1     n     superscript  x  2     b  x   c      x^{n+1}\,\bmod\,\big(n,x^{2}-bx-c)   . If     x   n  +  1    ≢   -  c      not-equivalent-to   superscript  x    n  1      c     x^{n+1}\not\equiv-c   then stop as n is composite.  (5) Let      n  2   -  1   =    2  r   s          superscript  n  2   1      superscript  2  r   s     n^{2}-1=2^{r}s   with s odd. If     x  s   ≢   1  mod   (  n  ,    x  2   -   b  x   -  c   )       not-equivalent-to   superscript  x  s    modulo  1   n     superscript  x  2     b  x   c       x^{s}\not\equiv 1\bmod\,\big(n,x^{2}-bx-c)   , and     x    2  j   s    ≢    -  1   mod   (  n  ,    x  2   -   b  x   -  c   )       not-equivalent-to   superscript  x     superscript  2  j   s     modulo    1    n     superscript  x  2     b  x   c       x^{2^{j}s}\not\equiv-1\bmod\,\big(n,x^{2}-bx-c)   for all    0  ≤  j  ≤   r  -  2         0  j         r  2      0\leq j\leq r-2   , then stop as n is composite.   If the QFT doesn't stop in steps (1)–(5), then n is a probable prime.  See also   Integers modulo n  Multiplicative group of integers modulo n   References  "  Category:Primality tests     ↩  ↩
