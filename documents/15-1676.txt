Quadratic Frobenius test

The quadratic Frobenius test (QFT) is a probabilistic primality test to test whether a number is a probable prime. It is named after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius. The test uses the concepts of quadratic polynomials and the Frobenius automorphism. A composite passing this test is called a Frobenius pseudoprime.
Concept
Grantham's stated goal when developing the algorithm was to provide a test that primes would always pass and composites would pass with a probability of less than 1/7710.1
The test was later extended by Damgård and Frandsen to a test called extended quadratic Frobenius test (EQFT).2
Algorithm
Let n be a positive integer such that n is odd, (b2 + 4c | n) = −1 and (−c | n) = 1, where (x | n) denotes the Jacobi symbol. Set B = 50000. Then a QFT on n with parameters (b, c) works as follows:

(1) Test whether one of the primes less than or equal to the lower of the two values 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  divides n. If yes, then stop as n is composite.
 
(2) Test whether 
 
 
 
 . If yes, then stop as n is composite.
 
(3) Compute 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  then stop as n is composite.
 
(4) Compute 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  then stop as n is composite.
 
(5) Let 
 
 
 
  with s odd. If 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , then stop as n is composite.
 

If the QFT doesn't stop in steps (1)–(5), then n is a probable prime.
