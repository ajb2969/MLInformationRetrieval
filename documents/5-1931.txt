   Idempotency of entailment      Idempotency of entailment   Idempotency of entailment is a property of logical systems that states that one may derive the same consequences from many instances of a hypothesis as from just one. This property can be captured by a structural rule called contraction and in such systems one may say that entailment is idempotent if and only if contraction is an admissible rule .  Rule of Contraction: from  A,C,C -> B  is derived  A,C -> B.  Or in sequent calculus notation,        Γ  ,  C  ,  C   ⊢  B     Γ  ,  C   ⊢  B        proves   normal-Γ  C  C   B    proves   normal-Γ  C   B     \frac{\Gamma,C,C\vdash B}{\Gamma,C\vdash B}     "  Category:Logical consequence  Category:Theorems in propositional logic
