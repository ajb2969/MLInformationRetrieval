   Fatty-acyl-ethyl-ester synthase      Fatty-acyl-ethyl-ester synthase   In enzymology , a fatty-acyl-ethyl-ester synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a long-chain-fatty-acyl ethyl ester + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a long-chain-fatty acid + ethanol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are long-chain-fatty-acyl ethyl ester and H 2 O , whereas its two products are long-chain-fatty acid and ethanol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is long-chain-fatty-acyl-ethyl-ester acylhydrolase . This enzyme is also called FAEES .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
