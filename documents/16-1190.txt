   Murnaghan–Nakayama rule      Murnaghan–Nakayama rule   In mathematics, the Murnaghan–Nakayama rule is a combinatorial method to compute irreducible character values of the symmetric group . 1 There are several generalizations of this rule.  The Murnaghan–Nakayama is a combinatorial rule for computing the integers χ. Here, λ and ρ are both integer partitions of some number k .  Theorem:       χ  ρ  λ   =    ∑  T     (   -  1   )    h  t   (  T  )           subscript   superscript  χ  λ   ρ     subscript   T    superscript    1     h  t  T       \chi^{\lambda}_{\rho}=\sum_{T}(-1)^{ht(T)}   where the sum is taken over all border-strip tableaux of shape λ, and type ρ. That is, each tableau T is a tableau such that   every row and column is weakly increasing  the integer i appears ρ i times  the set of squares with the number i form a border strip , that is, it is a connected skew-shape with no 2×2-square.   The height , ht (T), is the sum of the heights of the border strips in T . The height of a border strip is one less than the number of rows it touches.
