Wallis product

In mathematics, Wallis' product for π, written down in 1655 by John Wallis, states that



Derivation
Wallis derived this infinite product as it is done in calculus books today, by comparing 
 
 
 
  for even and odd values of n, and noting that for large n, increasing n by 1 results in a change that becomes ever smaller as n increases. Since infinitesimal calculus as we know it did not yet exist then, and the mathematical analysis of the time was inadequate to discuss the convergence issues, this was a hard piece of research, and tentative as well.
Wallis' product is, in retrospect, an easy corollary of the later Euler formula for the sine function.
Proof using Euler's infinite product for the sine function1



Let x = 
 
 
 
 :



Proof using integration2
Let:


 
  (a form of Wallis' integrals). Integrate by parts:

Relation to Stirling's approximation
Stirling's approximation for n! asserts that



as n → ∞. Consider now the finite approximations to the Wallis product, obtained by taking the first k terms in the product:



pk can be written as



Substituting Stirling's approximation in this expression (both for k! and (2k)!) one can deduce (after a short calculation) that pk converges to 
 
 
 
  as k → ∞.
ζ'(0)3
The Riemann zeta function and the Dirichlet eta function can be defined:



Applying an Euler transform to the latter series, the following is obtained:
