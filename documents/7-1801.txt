   Position operator      Position operator   In quantum mechanics , the position operator is the operator that corresponds to the position observable of a particle . The eigenvalue of the operator is the position vector of the particle. 1  Introduction  In one dimension, the square modulus of the wave function,      |  ψ  |   2   =    ψ  *   ψ        superscript    ψ   2      superscript  ψ    ψ     |\psi|^{2}=\psi^{*}\psi   , represents the probability density of finding the particle at position   x   x   x   . Hence the expected value of a measurement of the position of the particle is       ⟨  x  ⟩   =    ∫   -  ∞    +  ∞     x    |  ψ  |   2   d  x    =    ∫   -  ∞    +  ∞      ψ  *   x  ψ  d  x           delimited-⟨⟩  x     superscript   subscript               x   superscript    ψ   2   d  x           superscript   subscript                superscript  ψ    x  ψ  d  x       \langle x\rangle=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}x|\psi|^{2}dx=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty%
 }\psi^{*}x\psi dx     Accordingly, the quantum mechanical operator corresponding to position is    x  ^     normal-^  x    \hat{x}   , where        (    x  ^   ψ   )    (  x  )    =   x  ψ   (  x  )             normal-^  x   ψ   x     x  ψ  x     (\hat{x}\psi)(x)=x\psi(x)     Eigenstates  The eigenfunctions of the position operator, represented in position basis, are dirac delta functions . To show this, suppose   ψ   ψ   \psi   is an eigenstate of the position operator with eigenvalue    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   . We write the eigenvalue equation in position coordinates,        x  ^   ψ   (  x  )    =   x  ψ   (  x  )    =    x  0   ψ   (  x  )             normal-^  x   ψ  x     x  ψ  x           subscript  x  0   ψ  x      \hat{x}\psi(x)=x\psi(x)=x_{0}\psi(x)     recalling that    x  ^     normal-^  x    \hat{x}   simply multiplies the function by   x   x   x   in position representation. Since   x   x   x   is a variable while    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   is a constant,   ψ   ψ   \psi   must be zero everywhere except at    x  =   x  0       x   subscript  x  0     x=x_{0}   . The normalized solution to this is       ψ   (  x  )    =   δ   (   x  -   x  0    )          ψ  x     δ    x   subscript  x  0       \psi(x)=\delta(x-x_{0})     Although such a state is physically unrealizable and, strictly speaking, not a function, it can be thought of as an "ideal state" whose position is known exactly (any measurement of the position always returns the eigenvalue    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   ). Hence, by the uncertainty principle , nothing is known about the momentum of such a state.  Three dimensions  The generalisation to three dimensions is straightforward. The wavefunction is now    ψ   (  𝕣  ,  t  )       ψ   𝕣  t     \psi(\mathbb{r},t)   and the expectation value of the position is       ⟨  𝕣  ⟩   =   ∫   𝕣    |  ψ  |   2    d  3   𝕣         delimited-⟨⟩  𝕣       𝕣   superscript    ψ   2    superscript  d  3   𝕣      \langle\mathbb{r}\rangle=\int\mathbb{r}|\psi|^{2}d^{3}\mathbb{r}     where the integral is taken over all space. The position operator is        𝕣  ^   ψ   =   𝕣  ψ          normal-^  𝕣   ψ     𝕣  ψ     \mathbb{\hat{r}}\psi=\mathbb{r}\psi     Momentum space  In momentum space , the position operator in one dimension is       x  ^   =   i  ℏ   d   d  p          normal-^  x     i  Planck-constant-over-2-pi    d    d  p       \hat{x}=i\hbar\frac{d}{dp}     Formalism  Consider, for example, the case of a spinless particle moving in one spatial dimension (i.e. in a line). The state space for such a particle is L 2 ( R ) , the Hilbert space of complex-valued and square-integrable (with respect to the Lebesgue measure ) functions on the real line . The position operator, Q , is then defined by: 2 3       Q   (  ψ  )    (  x  )    =   x  ψ   (  x  )          Q  ψ  x     x  ψ  x     Q(\psi)(x)=x\psi(x)     with domain        D   (  Q  )    =   {   ψ  ∈    L  2    (  𝐑  )     |    Q  ψ   ∈    L  2    (  𝐑  )     }    .        D  Q    conditional-set    ψ     superscript  L  2   𝐑        Q  ψ      superscript  L  2   𝐑       D(Q)=\{\psi\in L^{2}({\mathbf{R}})\,|\,Q\psi\in L^{2}({\mathbf{R}})\}.     Since all continuous functions with compact support lie in D(Q) , Q is densely defined . Q , being simply multiplication by x , is a self adjoint operator , thus satisfying the requirement of a quantum mechanical observable. Immediately from the definition we can deduce that the spectrum consists of the entire real line and that Q has purely continuous spectrum , therefore no discrete eigenvalues . The three-dimensional case is defined analogously. We shall keep the one-dimensional assumption in the following discussion.  Measurement  As with any quantum mechanical observable , in order to discuss measurement , we need to calculate the spectral resolution of Q :       Q  =   ∫   λ  d   Ω  Q    (  λ  )      .      Q      λ  d   subscript  normal-Ω  Q   λ      Q=\int\lambda d\Omega_{Q}(\lambda).     Since Q is just multiplication by x , its spectral resolution is simple. For a Borel subset  B of the real line, let    χ  B     subscript  χ  B    \chi_{B}   denote the indicator function of B . We see that the projection-valued measure Ω Q is given by         Ω  Q    (  B  )   ψ   =    χ  B   ψ    ,         subscript  normal-Ω  Q   B  ψ      subscript  χ  B   ψ     \Omega_{Q}(B)\psi=\chi_{B}\psi,     i.e. Ω Q is multiplication by the indicator function of B . Therefore, if the system is prepared in state ψ , then the probability of the measured position of the particle being in a Borel set  B is         |    Ω  Q    (  B  )   ψ   |   2   =    |    χ  B   ψ   |   2   =    ∫  B      |  ψ  |   2   d  μ     ,         superscript       subscript  normal-Ω  Q   B  ψ    2    superscript       subscript  χ  B   ψ    2          subscript   B      superscript    ψ   2   d  μ       |\Omega_{Q}(B)\psi|^{2}=|\chi_{B}\psi|^{2}=\int_{B}|\psi|^{2}d\mu,     where μ is the Lebesgue measure. After the measurement, the wave function collapses to either        Ω  Q    (  B  )   ψ    ∥    Ω  Q    (  B  )   ψ   ∥          subscript  normal-Ω  Q   B  ψ    norm     subscript  normal-Ω  Q   B  ψ      \frac{\Omega_{Q}(B)\psi}{\|\Omega_{Q}(B)\psi\|}     or        (   1  -   χ  B    )   ψ    ∥    (   1  -   χ  B    )   ψ   ∥           1   subscript  χ  B    ψ    norm      1   subscript  χ  B    ψ      \frac{(1-\chi_{B})\psi}{\|(1-\chi_{B})\psi\|}   , where    ∥  ⋯  ∥     norm  normal-⋯    \|\cdots\|   is the Hilbert space norm on L 2 ( R ).
