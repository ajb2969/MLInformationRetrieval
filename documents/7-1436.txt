   SAIFI      SAIFI   The System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) 1 is commonly used as a reliability indicator by electric power utilities. SAIFI is the average number of interruptions that a customer would experience, and is calculated as      SAIFI  =     ∑    λ  i    N  i       N  T        SAIFI         subscript  λ  i    subscript  N  i      subscript  N  T      \mbox{SAIFI}=\frac{\sum{\lambda_{i}N_{i}}}{N_{T}}     where    λ  i     subscript  λ  i    \lambda_{i}   is the failure rate,    N  i     subscript  N  i    N_{i}   is the number of customers for location   i   i   i   and    N  T     subscript  N  T    N_{T}   is the total number of customers served. In other words,      SAIFI  =   total number of customer interruptions  total number of customers served       SAIFI    total number of customer interruptions  total number of customers served     \mbox{SAIFI}=\frac{\mbox{total number of customer interruptions}}{\mbox{total %
 number of customers served}}     SAIFI is measured in units of interruptions per customer. It is usually measured over the course of a year, and according to IEEE Standard 1366-1998 the median value for North American utilities is approximately 1.10 interruptions per customer.
