Term indexing

In computer science, a term index is a data structure to facilitate fast lookup of terms and clauses in a logic program,1 deductive database, or automated theorem prover.
Many operations in automatic theorem provers require search in huge collections of terms and clauses. Such operations typically fall into the following scheme. Given a collection 
 
 
 
  of terms (clauses) and a query term (clause) 
 
 
 
 , find in 
 
 
 
  some/all terms 
 
 
 
  related to 
 
 
 
  according to a certain retrieval condition. Most interesting retrieval conditions are formulated as existence of a substitution that relates in a special way the query and the retrieved objects 
 
 
 
 . Here is a list of retrieval conditions frequently used in provers:

term 
 
 
 
  is unifiable with term 
 
 
 
 , i.e., there exists a substitution 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
  = 
 
 

term 
 
 
 
  is an instance of 
 
 
 
 , i.e., there exists a substitution 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
  = 
 
 

term 
 
 
 
  is a generalisation of 
 
 
 
 , i.e., there exists a substitution 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
  = 
 
 

clause 
 
 
 
  subsumes clause 
 
 
 
 , i.e., there exists a substitution 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
  is a subset/submultiset of 
 
 

clause 
 
 
 
  is subsumed by 
 
 
 
 , i.e., there exists a substitution 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
  is a subset/submultiset of 
 
 


More often than not, we are actually interested in finding the appropriate substitutions explicitly, together with the retrieved terms 
 
 
 
 , rather than just in establishing existence of such substitutions.
Very often the sizes of term sets to be searched are large, the retrieval calls are frequent and the retrieval condition test is rather complex. In such situations linear search in 
 
 
 
 , when the retrieval condition is tested on every term from 
 
 
 
 , becomes prohibitively costly. To overcome this problem, special data structures, called indexes, are designed in order to support fast retrieval. Such data structures, together with the accompanying algorithms for index maintenance and retrieval, are called term indexing techniques.
Classic indexing techniques

substitution trees
path indexing

Modern indexing techniques

feature vector indexing
code trees
context trees
