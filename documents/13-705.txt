   Linear entropy      Linear entropy   In quantum mechanics , and especially quantum information theory , the linear entropy or impurity of a state is a scalar defined as         S  L     =  ˙   1   -   Tr   (   ρ  2   )           subscript  S  L    normal-˙    1     Tr   superscript  ρ  2      S_{L}\,\dot{=}\,1-\mbox{Tr}(\rho^{2})\,     where ρ is the density matrix of the state.  The linear entropy can range between zero, corresponding to a completely pure state, and (1 − 1/ d ), corresponding to a completely mixed state. (Here, d is the dimension of the density matrix.)  The linear entropy is trivially related to the purity     γ    γ   \gamma\,   of a state by         S  L    =   1  -   γ     .       subscript  S  L     1  γ     S_{L}\,=\,1-\gamma\,.     Motivation  The linear entropy is a lower approximation to the (quantum) von Neumann entropy  S , which is defined as          S     =  ˙     -   Tr   (   ρ   ln  ρ    )     =   -   ⟨   ln  ρ   ⟩     .          S   normal-˙       Tr    ρ    ρ         delimited-⟨⟩    ρ       S\,\dot{=}\,-\mbox{Tr}(\rho\ln\rho)=-\langle\ln\rho\rangle\,.     The linear entropy then is obtained by expanding ln ρ = ln (1−(1− ρ )), around a pure state, ρ 2 = ρ ; that is, expanding in terms of the non-negative matrix 1− ρ in the formal Mercator series for the logarithm,        -   ⟨   ln  ρ   ⟩    =    ⟨   1  -  ρ   ⟩   +    ⟨    (   1  -  ρ   )   2   ⟩   /  2   +    ⟨    (   1  -  ρ   )   3   ⟩   /  3   +   …     ,         delimited-⟨⟩    ρ        delimited-⟨⟩    1  ρ       delimited-⟨⟩   superscript    1  ρ   2    2      delimited-⟨⟩   superscript    1  ρ   3    3   normal-…     -\langle\ln\rho\rangle=\langle 1-\rho\rangle+\langle(1-\rho)^{2}\rangle/2+%
 \langle(1-\rho)^{3}\rangle/3+...~{},   and retaining just the leading term.  The linear entropy and von Neumann entropy are similar measures of the degree of mixing of a state, although the linear entropy is easier to calculate, as it does not require diagonalization of the density matrix.  Alternate definition  Some authors 1 define linear entropy with a different normalization         S  L      =  ˙      d   d  -  1      (   1  -   Tr   (   ρ  2   )     )    ,       subscript  S  L    normal-˙      d    d  1      1    Tr   superscript  ρ  2       S_{L}\,\dot{=}\,\tfrac{d}{d-1}(1-\mbox{Tr}(\rho^{2}))\,,   which ensures that the quantity ranges from zero to unity.
