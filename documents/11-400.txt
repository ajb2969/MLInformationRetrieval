11-cis-retinyl-palmitate hydrolase

In enzymology, a 11-cis-retinyl-palmitate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

11-cis-retinyl palmitate + H2O 
 
 
 
  11-cis-retinol + palmitate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 11-cis-retinyl palmitate and H2O, whereas its two products are 11-cis-retinol and palmitate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 11-cis-retinyl-palmitate acylhydrolase. Other names in common use include 11-cis-retinol palmitate esterase, and RPH. This enzyme participates in retinol metabolism. This enzyme has at least one effector, Bile salt.
