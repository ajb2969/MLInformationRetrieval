   Sulfite dehydrogenase      Sulfite dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a sulfite dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   sulfite + 2 ferricytochrome c + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   sulfate + 2 ferrocytochrome c + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are sulfite , ferricytochrome c , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are sulfate , ferrocytochrome c , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donor with a cytochrome as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sulfite:ferricytochrome-c oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include sulfite cytochrome c reductase , sulfite-cytochrome c oxidoreductase , and sulfite oxidase . This enzyme participates in sulfur metabolism .
