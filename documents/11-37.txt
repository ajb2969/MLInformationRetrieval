   Acetoacetate—CoA ligase      Acetoacetate—CoA ligase   In enzymology , an acetoacetate-CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + acetoacetate + CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + acetoacetyl-CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , acetoacetate , and CoA , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and acetoacetyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetoacetate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming) . This enzyme is also called acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase . This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism .
