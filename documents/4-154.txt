Elliptic partial differential equation

An elliptic partial differential equation is a general partial differential equation of second order of the form


 
  that satisfies the condition



(Assuming implicitly that 
 
 
 
 . )
Just as one classifies conic sections and quadratic forms based on the discriminant

 
 , the same can be done for a second-order PDE at a given point. However, the discriminant in a PDE is given by 
 
 
 
  due to the convention (discussion and explanation here). The above form is analogous to the equation for a planar ellipse:


 
  , which becomes (for 
 
 
 
 ) :


 
  , and 
 
 
 
  . This resembles the standard ellipse equation
 
 

In general, if there are n independent variables x1, x2, ..., xn, a general linear partial differential equation of second order has the form


 
 , where L is an elliptic operator.
For example, in three dimensions (x,y,z) :



which, for completely separable u (i.e. u(x,y,z)=u(x)u(y)u(z) ) gives



This can be compared to the equation for an ellipsoid;
