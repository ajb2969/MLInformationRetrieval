   Quintom scenario      Quintom scenario   Quintom scenario is a hypothetical scenario of dark energy with the equation of state crossing the cosmological constant boundary (    w  =   -  1       w    1     w=-1   ) from above to below, or oppositely. Theoretically, a no-go theorem 1 has been proved showing that, to generate this scenario, at least two degrees of freedom are required for dark energy models.  If this scenario exists, it may indicate how the universe avoids the dooms of time-like singularities, such as Big Bang , Big Rip , and so on. For example, one application of quintom scenario in 2008 was to a model of inflationary cosmology without Big Bang singularity.  One application of quintom in 2007 was in a Big Bounce model of the universe.
