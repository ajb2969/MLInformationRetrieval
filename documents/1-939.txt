   Stimulus–response model      Stimulus–response model   The stimulus–response model is a characterization of a statistical unit (such as a neuron ) as a black box model, predicting a quantitative response to a quantitative stimulus , for example one administered by a researcher.  Fields of application  Stimulus–response models are applied in international relations, 1  psychology , 2 risk assessment, 3  neuroscience , 4 neurally-inspired system design, 5 and many other fields.  Mathematical formulation  The object of a stimulus–response model is to establish a mathematical function that describes the relation f between the stimulus x and the expected value (or other measure of location) of the response Y :       E   (  Y  )    =   f   (  x  )          E  Y     f  x     E(Y)=f(x)     A common simplification assumed for such functions is linear, thus we expect to see a relationship like        E   (  Y  )    =   α  +   β  x     .        E  Y     α    β  x      E(Y)=\alpha+\beta x.     Statistical theory for linear models has been well developed for more than fifty years, and a standard form of analysis called linear regression has been developed.
