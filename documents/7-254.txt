   Positive and negative sets      Positive and negative sets   In measure theory , given a measurable space ( X ,Σ) and a signed measure μ on it, a set A ∈ Σ is called a positive set for μ if every Σ-measurable subset of A has nonnegative measure; that is, for every E ⊆ A that satisfies E ∈ Σ, one has μ( E ) ≥ 0.  Similarly, a set A ∈ Σ is called a negative set for μ if for every subset E of A satisfying E ∈ Σ, one has μ( E ) ≤ 0.  Intuitively, a measurable set A is positive (resp. negative) for μ if μ is nonnegative (resp. nonpositive) everywhere on A . Of course, if μ is a nonnegative measure , every element of Σ is a positive set for μ.  In the light of Radon–Nikodym theorem , if ν is a σ-finite positive measure such that |μ| n ) n is a sequence of positive sets, then       ⋃   n  =  1   ∞    A  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  A  n     \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}   is also a positive set; the same is true if the word "positive" is replaced by "negative".  A set which is both positive and negative is a μ- null set , for if E is a measurable subset of a positive and negative set A , then both μ( E ) ≥ 0 and μ( E ) ≤ 0 must hold, and therefore, μ( E ) = 0.  Hahn decomposition  The Hahn decomposition theorem states that for every measurable space ( X ,Σ) with a signed measure μ, there is a partition of X into a positive and a negative set; such a partition ( P , N ) is unique up to μ-null sets, and is called a Hahn decomposition of the signed measure μ.  Given a Hahn decomposition ( P , N ) of X , it is easy to show that A ⊆ X is a positive set if and only if A differs from a subset of P by a μ-null set; equivalently, if A − P is μ-null. The same is true for negative sets, if N is used instead of P .  "  Category:Measure theory
