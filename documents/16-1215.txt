Rosenbrock system matrix

The Rosenbrock System Matrix (or Rosenbrock's system matrix) of a linear time invariant system is a useful representation bridging state-space representation and transfer function matrix form. It was proposed in 1967 by Howard H. Rosenbrock.1
Definition
Consider the dynamic system











The Rosenbrock system matrix is given by






sI-A & -B\\ C & D \end{pmatrix}. In the original work by Rosenbrock, the constant matrix 
 
 
 
  is allowed to be a polynomial in 
 
 
 
 .
The transfer function between the input 
 
 
 
  and output 
 
 
 
  is given by






sI-A & -b_i\\ c_j & d_{ij} \end{vmatrix}}{|sI-A|} where 
 
 
 
  is the column 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the row 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 .
Based in this representation, Rosenbrock developed his version of the PHB test.
Short form
For computational purposes, a short form of the Rosenbrock system matrix is more appropriate2 and given by






A & B\\ C & D \end{pmatrix}. The short form of the Rosenbrock system matrix has been widely used in H-infinity methods in control theory, where it is also referred to as packed form; see command pck in.3 An interpretation of the Rosenbrock System Matrix as a Linear Fractional Transformation can be found in.4
One of the first applications of the Rosenbrock form was the development of an efficient computational method for Kalman decomposition, which is based on the pivot element method. A variant of Rosenbrockâ€™s method is implemented in the minreal command of Matlab.5 as well as GNU Octave.
