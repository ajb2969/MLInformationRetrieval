   Rosenbrock system matrix      Rosenbrock system matrix   The Rosenbrock System Matrix (or Rosenbrock's system matrix) of a linear time invariant system is a useful representation bridging state-space representation and transfer function matrix form . It was proposed in 1967 by Howard H. Rosenbrock . 1  Definition  Consider the dynamic system          x  ˙   =    A  x   +   B  u     ,       normal-˙  x       A  x     B  u      \dot{x}=Ax+Bu,          y  =    C  x   +   D  u     .      y      C  x     D  u      y=Cx+Du.        The Rosenbrock system matrix is given by    P(s)=\begin{pmatrix}     sI-A & -B\\ C & D \end{pmatrix}. In the original work by Rosenbrock, the constant matrix   D   D   D   is allowed to be a polynomial in   s   s   s   .  The transfer function between the input   i   i   i   and output   j   j   j   is given by    g_{ij}=\frac{\begin{vmatrix}     sI-A & -b_i\\ c_j & d_{ij} \end{vmatrix}}{|sI-A|} where    b  i     subscript  b  i    b_{i}   is the column   i   i   i   of   B   B   B   and    c  j     subscript  c  j    c_{j}   is the row   j   j   j   of   C   C   C   .  Based in this representation, Rosenbrock developed his version of the PHB test.  Short form  For computational purposes, a short form of the Rosenbrock system matrix is more appropriate 2 and given by    P\sim\begin{pmatrix}     A & B\\ C & D \end{pmatrix}. The short form of the Rosenbrock system matrix has been widely used in H-infinity methods in control theory , where it is also referred to as packed form; see command pck in. 3 An interpretation of the Rosenbrock System Matrix as a Linear Fractional Transformation can be found in. 4  One of the first applications of the Rosenbrock form was the development of an efficient computational method for Kalman decomposition , which is based on the pivot element method. A variant of Rosenbrock’s method is implemented in the minreal command of Matlab. 5 as well as GNU Octave .  References  "  Category:1967 introductions  Category:Control theory     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
