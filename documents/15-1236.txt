   27S pre-rRNA (guanosine2922-2'-O)-methyltransferase      27S pre-rRNA (guanosine2922-2'-O)-methyltransferase   27S pre-rRNA (guanosine 2922 -2'-O)-methyltransferase (, Spb1p (gene) , YCL054W (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:27S pre-rRNA (guanosine 2922 -2'-O-)-methyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanosine 2922 in 27S pre-rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylguanosine 2922 in 27S pre-rRNA   Spb1p is a site-specific 2'-O-ribose RNA methyltransferase that catalyses the formation of 2'-O-methylguanosine2922.
