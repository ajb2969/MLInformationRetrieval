   (g,K)-module      (g,K)-module   In mathematics , more specifically in the representation theory of reductive Lie groups , a    (  𝔤  ,  K  )     𝔤  K    (\mathfrak{g},K)    -module is an algebraic object, first introduced by Harish-Chandra , 1 used to deal with continuous infinite-dimensional representations using algebraic techniques. Harish-Chandra showed that the study of irreducible unitary representations of a real reductive Lie group, G , could be reduced to the study of irreducible    (  𝔤  ,  K  )     𝔤  K    (\mathfrak{g},K)   -modules, where   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is the Lie algebra of G and K is a maximal compact subgroup of G . 2  Definition  Let G be a real Lie group. Let   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   be its Lie algebra, and K a maximal compact subgroup with Lie algebra   𝔨   𝔨   \mathfrak{k}   . A    (  𝔤  ,  K  )     𝔤  K    (\mathfrak{g},K)   -module is defined as follows: 3 it is a vector space  V that is both a Lie algebra representation of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   and a group representation of K (without regard to the topology of K ) satisfying the following three conditions   1. for any v ∈ V , k ∈ K , and X ∈   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}         k  ⋅   (   X  ⋅  v   )    =    (    Ad   (  k  )    X   )   ⋅   (   k  ⋅  v   )         normal-⋅  k   normal-⋅  X  v     normal-⋅    Ad  k   X    normal-⋅  k  v      k\cdot(X\cdot v)=(\operatorname{Ad}(k)X)\cdot(k\cdot v)      2. for any v ∈ V , Kv spans a finite-dimensional subspace of V on which the action of K is continuous  3. for any v ∈ V and Y ∈   𝔨   𝔨   \mathfrak{k}            (     d   d  t     exp   (   t  Y   )     ⋅  v   )   |    t  =  0    =   Y  ⋅  v    .       evaluated-at   normal-⋅      d    d  t        t  Y     v     t  0     normal-⋅  Y  v     \left.\left(\frac{d}{dt}\exp(tY)\cdot v\right)\right|_{t=0}=Y\cdot v.       In the above, the dot,   ⋅   normal-⋅   \cdot   , denotes both the action of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   on V and that of K . The notation Ad( k ) denotes the adjoint action of G on   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   , and Kv is the set of vectors    k  ⋅  v     normal-⋅  k  v    k\cdot v   as k varies over all of K .  The first condition can be understood as follows: if G is the general linear group GL( n , R ), then   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is the algebra of all n by n matrices, and the adjoint action of k on X is kXk −1 ; condition 1 can then be read as        k  X  v   =   k  X   k   -  1    k  v   =    (   k  X   k   -  1     )   k  v    .          k  X  v     k  X   superscript  k    1    k  v            k  X   superscript  k    1     k  v      kXv=kXk^{-1}kv=\left(kXk^{-1}\right)kv.   In other words, it is a compatibility requirement among the actions of K on V ,   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   on V , and K on   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . The third condition is also a compatibility condition, this time between the action of   𝔨   𝔨   \mathfrak{k}   on V viewed as a sub-Lie algebra of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   and its action viewed as the differential of the action of K on V .
