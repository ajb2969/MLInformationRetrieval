   Two-stream instability      Two-stream instability   The two-stream instability is a very common instability in plasma physics. It can be induced by an energetic particle stream injected in a plasma, or setting a current along the plasma so different species ( ions and electrons ) can have different drift velocities. The energy from the particles can lead to plasma wave excitation.  Dispersion relation  Consider a cold, uniform, and unmagnetized plasma, where ions are stationary and the electrons have velocity    𝐕  0     subscript  𝐕  0    \mathbf{V}_{0}   , that is, the reference frame is moving with the ion stream. Let the electrostatic waves be of the form:       𝐄  1   =    ξ  1    exp   [   i   (    k  x   -   ω  t    )    ]     𝐱  ^         subscript  𝐄  1      subscript  ξ  1       i      k  x     ω  t       normal-^  𝐱      \mathbf{E}_{1}=\xi_{1}\exp[i(kx-\omega t)]\mathbf{\hat{x}}     Applying linearization techniques to the equation of motions for both species, to the equation of continuity, and Poisson's equation, and introducing the spatial and temporal harmonic operators     ∂  t   →   -   i  ω       normal-→   subscript   t       i  ω      \partial_{t}\rightarrow-i\omega   ,    ∇  →   i  k      normal-→  normal-∇    i  k     \nabla\rightarrow ik   we can get the following expression:       1  =    ω   p  e   2    [      m  e   /   m  i     ω  2    +   1    (   ω  -   k   v  0     )   2     ]     ,      1     superscript   subscript  ω    p  e    2    delimited-[]         subscript  m  e    subscript  m  i     superscript  ω  2      1   superscript    ω    k   subscript  v  0     2         1=\omega_{pe}^{2}\left[\frac{m_{e}/m_{i}}{\omega^{2}}+\frac{1}{(\omega-kv_{0})%
 ^{2}}\right],     which represents the dispersion relation for longitudinal waves, and represents a quartic equation in   ω   ω   \omega   . The roots can be expressed in the form:       ω  j   =    ω  j  R   +   i   γ  j          subscript  ω  j      superscript   subscript  ω  j   R     i   subscript  γ  j       \omega_{j}=\omega_{j}^{R}+i\gamma_{j}     If the imaginary part (    I  m   (   ω  j   )       I  m   subscript  ω  j     Im(\omega_{j})   ) is zero, then the solutions represent all the possible modes, and there is no temporal wave growth or damping at all:      𝐄  =   ξ   exp   [   i   (    k  x   -   ω  t    )    ]     𝐱  ^        𝐄    ξ      i      k  x     ω  t       normal-^  𝐱      \mathbf{E}=\xi\exp[i(kx-\omega t)]\mathbf{\hat{x}}     If     I  m   (   ω  j   )    ≠  0        I  m   subscript  ω  j    0    Im(\omega_{j})\neq 0   , that is, any of the roots are complex, they will occur in complex conjugate pairs. Substituting in the expression for electrostatic waves leads to:      𝐄  =   ξ   exp   [   i   (    k  x   -    ω  j  R   t    )    ]     exp   [   γ  t   ]     𝐱  ^        𝐄    ξ      i      k  x      superscript   subscript  ω  j   R   t          γ  t     normal-^  𝐱      \mathbf{E}=\xi\exp[i(kx-\omega_{j}^{R}t)]\exp[\gamma t]\mathbf{\hat{x}}     Because of the second exponential function at the right, the temporal dynamics of the wave amplitude depends strongly on the parameter   γ   γ   \gamma   ; if    γ  <  0      γ  0    \gamma<0   , then the waves will be exponentially damped; on the other hand, if    γ  >  0      γ  0    \gamma>0   , then the waves are unstable and will grow at an exponential rate.  Wave-particle interactions  (Figure)  bump on tail dist.png   The two stream instability can be thought of as the inverse of Landau damping , where the existence of a greater number of particles that move slower than the wave phase velocity    v   p  h      subscript  v    p  h     v_{ph}   as compared with those that move faster, leads to an energy transfer from the wave to the particles. In the case of the two stream instability , when an electron stream is injected to the plasma, the particles' velocity distribution function has a "bump" on its "tail". If a wave has phase velocity in the region where the slope is positive, there is a greater number of faster particles (    v  >   v   p  h        v   subscript  v    p  h      v>v_{ph}   ) than slower particles, and so there is a greater amount of energy being transferred from the fast particles to the wave, giving rise to exponential wave growth.
