   Arylsulfatase      Arylsulfatase   Arylsulfatase (, sulfatase , nitrocatechol sulfatase , phenolsulfatase , phenylsulfatase , p-nitrophenyl sulfatase , arylsulfohydrolase , 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfatase , estrogen sulfatase ) is a type of sulfatase  enzyme with system name aryl-sulfate sulfohydrolase . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   a phenol sulfate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a phenol + sulfate    This group of enzymes has similar specificities.  Types include:   Arylsulfatase A (also known as "cerebroside-sulfatase")  Arylsulfatase B (also known as "N-Acetylgalactosamine-4-Sulfatase")  Steroid sulfatase (formerly known as "Arylsulfatase C")  ARSC2  ARSD  ARSE  ARSF  ARSG  ARSH  ARSI  ARSJ  ARSK   See also   Aryl   References  "  Category:Hydrolases  Category:EC 3.1.6     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
