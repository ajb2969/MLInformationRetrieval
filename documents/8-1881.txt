Quasi-Frobenius Lie algebra

In mathematics, a quasi-Frobenius Lie algebra



over a field 
 
 
 
  is a Lie algebra



equipped with a nondegenerate skew-symmetric bilinear form


 
 , which is a Lie algebra 2-cocycle of 
 
 
 
  with values in 
 
 
 
 . In other words,








for all 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is a coboundary, which means that there exists a linear form 
 
 
 
  such that


 
  then


 
  is called a Frobenius Lie algebra.
Equivalence with pre-Lie algebras with nondegenerate invariant skew-symmetric bilinear form
If 
 
 
 
  is a quasi-Frobenius Lie algebra, one can define on 
 
 
 
  another bilinear product 
 
 
 
  by the formula




 
 .
 



Then one has 
 
 
 
  and


 
  is a pre-Lie algebra.
