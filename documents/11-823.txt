   2-acylglycerol O-acyltransferase      2-acylglycerol O-acyltransferase   In enzymology , a 2-acylglycerol O-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acyl-CoA + 2-acylglycerol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + diacylglycerol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and 2-acylglycerol , whereas its two products are CoA and diacylglycerol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:2-acylglycerol O-acyltransferase . Other names in common use include acylglycerol palmitoyltransferase , monoglyceride acyltransferase , acyl coenzyme A-monoglyceride acyltransferase , and monoacylglycerol acyltransferase . This enzyme participates in glycerolipid metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
