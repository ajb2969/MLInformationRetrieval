   Character (mathematics)      Character (mathematics)   In mathematics , a character is (most commonly) a special kind of function from a group to a field (such as the complex numbers ). There are at least two distinct, but overlapping meanings. Other uses of the word "character" are almost always qualified.  Multiplicative character  A multiplicative character (or linear character , or simply character ) on a group G is a group homomorphism from G to the multiplicative group of a field , usually the field of complex numbers . If G is any group, then the set Ch( G ) of these morphisms forms an abelian group under pointwise multiplication.  This group is referred to as the character group of G . Sometimes only unitary characters are considered (thus the image is in the unit circle ); other such homomorphisms are then called quasi-characters . Dirichlet characters can be seen as a special case of this definition.  Multiplicative characters are linearly independent , i.e. if     χ  1   ,   χ  2   ,  …  ,   χ  n       subscript  χ  1    subscript  χ  2   normal-…   subscript  χ  n     \chi_{1},\chi_{2},\ldots,\chi_{n}   are different characters on a group G then from       a  1    χ  1    +    a  2    χ  2    +  …  +    a  n    χ  n     =  0           subscript  a  1    subscript  χ  1       subscript  a  2    subscript  χ  2    normal-…     subscript  a  n    subscript  χ  n     0    a_{1}\chi_{1}+a_{2}\chi_{2}+\ldots+a_{n}\chi_{n}=0   it follows that     a  1   =   a  2   =  ⋯  =   a  n   =  0         subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2        normal-⋯        subscript  a  n        0     a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}=0   .  Character of a representation  The character of a representation  φ of a group G on a finite-dimensional vector space  V over a field F is the trace of the representation  φ . In general, the trace is not a group homomorphism, nor does the set of traces form a group. The characters of one-dimensional representations are identical to one-dimensional representations, so the above notion of multiplicative character can be seen as a special case of higher-dimensional characters. The study of representations using characters is called " character theory " and one dimensional characters are also called "linear characters" within this context.
