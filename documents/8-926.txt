Legendre rational functions

 In mathematics the Legendre rational functions are a sequence of functions which are both rational and orthogonal. A rational Legendre function of degree n is defined as:



where 
 
 
 
  is a Legendre polynomial. These functions are eigenfunctions of the singular Sturm-Liouville problem:



with eigenvalues



Properties
Many properties can be derived from the properties of the Legendre polynomials of the first kind. Other properties are unique to the functions themselves.
Recursion



and



Limiting behavior
 It can be shown that



and



Orthogonality



where 
 
 
 
  is the Kronecker delta function.
