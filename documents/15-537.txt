Catalan's minimal surface.

In differential geometry, Catalan's minimal surface is a minimal surface originally studied by Eugène Charles Catalan in 1855.1
It has the special property of being the minimal surface that contains a cycloid as a geodesic. It is also swept out by a family of parabolae.2
The surface has parametric equation:3
