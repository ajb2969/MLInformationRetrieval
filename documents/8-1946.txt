Ganea conjecture

Ganea's conjecture is a claim in algebraic topology, now disproved. It states that


 
  where cat(X) is the Lusternik–Schnirelmann category of a topological space X, and Sn is the n dimensional sphere.
The inequality


 
  holds for any pair of spaces, X and Y. Furthermore, cat(Sn)=1, for any sphere Sn, n>0. Thus, the conjecture amounts to cat(X × Sn) ≥ cat(X) + 1.
The conjecture was formulated by Tudor Ganea in 1971. Many particular cases of this conjecture were proved, till finally Norio Iwase gave a counterexample in 1998. In a follow-up paper from 2002, Iwase gave an even stronger counterexample, with X a closed, smooth manifold. This counterexample also disproved a related conjecture, stating that


 
  for a closed manifold M and p a point in M.
This work raises the question: For which spaces X is the Ganea condition, cat(X × Sn) = cat(X) + 1, satisfied? It has been conjectured that these are precisely the spaces X for which cat(X) equals a related invariant, Qcat(X).
