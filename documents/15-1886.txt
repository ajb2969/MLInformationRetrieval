AKNS system

In mathematics, the AKNS system is an integrable system of partial differential equations, introduced by and named after .
Definition
The AKNS system is a pair of two partial differential equations for two  complex-valued functions p and q of 2 variables t and x:






If p and q are  complex conjugates this reduces to the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation.
