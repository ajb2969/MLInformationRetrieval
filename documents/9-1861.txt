== Summary == Refractive index change of Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs). 1) a uniform positive-only refractive index change, where the refractive index change has a fixed amplitude. 2) a Gaussian-apodized positive only index change, where the refractive index change is graded to give impoved side lobe suppression while maintaining a strong reflectance. 3) a raise-cosine-apodized zero-dc refractive index change, again with a graded index change. 4) a discrete phase shift refractive index change, with a phase shift of
