Boedeker(June 2007).  The system used was    \partial_t q = (s_r+ i s_i) \Delta^2 q + (d_r+ i d_i) \Delta q + l_r q + (c_r + i     c_i)|q|^2 q + (q_r + i q_i) |q|^4 q.  with parameters s r = -1.0, s i = 0.0, d r = -2.0, d i = 2.0, l r = -1.7, c r = 2.5, c i = 1.0, q r = -1.0, q i = 0.0, no-flux boundary conditions. The initial phase difference between the dissipative solitons is 0 , but the qualitative outcome in the same for other phase differences as well. A finite element code was used for the simulation.
