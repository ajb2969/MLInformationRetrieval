   Convex lattice polytope      Convex lattice polytope   A convex lattice polytope (also called Z-polyhedron or Z-polytope ) is a geometric object playing an important role in discrete geometry and combinatorial commutative algebra . It is a polytope in a Euclidean space R n which is a convex hull of finitely many points in the integer lattice  Z n ⊂ R n . Such objects are prominently featured in the theory of toric varieties , where they correspond to polarized projective toric varieties.  Examples   An n -dimensional simplex Δ in R n+1 is the convex hull of n +1 points that do not lie on a single affine hyperplane. The simplex is a convex lattice polytope if (and only if) the vertices have integral coordinates. The corresponding toric variety is the n -dimensional projective space  P n .  The unit cube in R n , whose vertices are the 2 n points all of whose coordinates are 0 or 1 , is a convex lattice polytope. The corresponding toric variety is the Segre embedding of the n -fold product of the projective line P 1 .  In the special case of two-dimensional convex lattice polytopes in R 2 , they are also known as convex lattice polygons .  In algebraic geometry , an important instance of lattice polytopes called the Newton polytopes are the convex hulls of the set   A   A   A   which consists of all the exponent vectors appearing in a collection of monomials. For example, consider the polynomial of the form     a  x  y   +   b   x  2    +   c   y  5    +  d        a  x  y     b   superscript  x  2      c   superscript  y  5    d    axy+bx^{2}+cy^{5}+d   with     a  ,  b  ,  c  ,  d   ≠  0       a  b  c  d   0    a,b,c,d\neq 0   has a lattice equal to the triangle        conv   (   {   (  1  ,  1  )   ,   (  2  ,  0  )   ,   (  0  ,  5  )   ,   (  0  ,  0  )   }   )    .      conv    1  1    2  0    0  5    0  0      {\rm conv}(\{(1,1),(2,0),(0,5),(0,0)\}).
