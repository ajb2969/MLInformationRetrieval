   Carveol dehydrogenase      Carveol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a carveol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (-)-trans-carveol + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (-)-carvone + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (-)-trans-carveol and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are (-)-carvone , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (-)-trans-carveol:NADP + oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called (-)-trans-carveol dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in monoterpenoid biosynthesis and limonene and pinene degradation .
