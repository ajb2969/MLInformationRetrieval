   Anthranilate N-benzoyltransferase      Anthranilate N-benzoyltransferase   In enzymology , an anthranilate N-benzoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   benzoyl-CoA + anthranilate $\rightleftharpoons$ CoA + N-benzoylanthranilate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are benzoyl-CoA and anthranilate , whereas its two products are CoA and N-benzoylanthranilate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is benzoyl-CoA:anthranilate N-benzoyltransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure  Category:Anthranilates
