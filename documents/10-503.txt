   Erythrulose reductase      Erythrulose reductase   In enzymology , an erythrulose reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   erythritol + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-erythrulose + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are erythritol and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are D-erythrulose , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is erythritol:NADP + oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called D-erythrulose reductase .
