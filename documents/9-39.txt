Oriented projective geometry

Oriented projective geometry is an oriented version of real projective geometry.
Whereas the real projective plane describes the set of all unoriented lines through the origin in R3, the oriented projective plane describes lines with a given orientation. There are applications in computer graphics and computer vision where it is necessary to distinguish between rays light being emitted or absorbed by a point.
Elements in an oriented projective space are defined using signed homogeneous coordinates. Let 
 
 
 
  be the set of elements of 
 
 
 
  excluding the origin.

These spaces can be viewed as extensions of euclidean space. 
 
 
 
  can be viewed as the union of two copies of 
 
 
 
 , the sets (x,1) and (x,-1), plus two additional points at infinity, (1,0) and (-1,0). Likewise 
 
 
 
  can be view two copies of 
 
 
 
 , (x,y,1) and (x,y,-1), plus one copy of 
 
 
 
  (x,y,0).
An alternative way to view the spaces is as points on the circle or sphere, given by the points (x,y,w) with

x2+y2+z2=1.
