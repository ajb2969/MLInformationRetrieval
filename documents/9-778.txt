LBOZ

LBOZ is a coefficient used in spectrophotometry to estimate selectivity (amount of overlapping of spectra) in quantitative manner. It is named after its creators: Lorber, Bergmann, von Oepen, and Zinn.
Definition
thumb|right 300 px|Sample synthetic spectra of four components Let 
 
 
 
  be a matrix of the spectra (absorbances), where the k rows correspond to the components in mixture and n columns correspond to the sequence of wavelengths. The LBOZ criterion for kth component is calculated from the following formula:



where 
 
 
 
  means a pseudoinverse of the matrix and 
 
 
 
  means an euclidean length of a vector.
Properties
The image above show synthetic gaussian spectra. The LBOZ criteria are: 0.561 for black compound, 0.402 for red compound, 0.899 for green and 0.549 for blue. LBOZ always lie in range  and has strong mathematical sense - it presents the amount of spectral signal which is not overlapped by the others. Hence, the uncertainty of a compound quantity increases by 
 
 
 
  in presence of the other compounds. In this case, the highest uncertainty is expected during determination of red compound - theoretically 2.38 times greater than during determination of its compound alone.
