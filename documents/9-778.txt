   LBOZ      LBOZ   LBOZ is a coefficient used in spectrophotometry to estimate selectivity (amount of overlapping of spectra ) in quantitative manner. It is named after its creators: Lorber, Bergmann, von Oepen, and Zinn.  Definition  thumb|right 300 px|Sample synthetic spectra of four components Let   𝐗   𝐗   \mathbf{X}   be a matrix of the spectra (absorbances), where the k rows correspond to the components in mixture and n columns correspond to the sequence of wavelengths. The LBOZ criterion for k th component is calculated from the following formula:       ξ  k   =   1    ∥   𝐗   k  -   r  o  w     ∥    ∥   𝐗   k  -   c  o  l    +   ∥          subscript  ξ  k     1     norm   subscript  𝐗    k    r  o  w       norm   subscript   superscript  𝐗      k    c  o  l          \xi_{k}=\frac{1}{\|\mathbf{X}_{k-row}\|\|\mathbf{X}^{+}_{k-col}\|}     where    𝐗  +     superscript  𝐗     \mathbf{X}^{+}   means a pseudoinverse of the matrix and    ∥  ⋯  ∥     norm  normal-⋯    \|\cdots\|   means an euclidean length of a vector.  Properties  The image above show synthetic gaussian spectra. The LBOZ criteria are: 0.561 for black compound, 0.402 for red compound, 0.899 for green and 0.549 for blue. LBOZ always lie in range  and has strong mathematical sense - it presents the amount of spectral signal which is not overlapped by the others. Hence, the uncertainty of a compound quantity increases by    1  /  ξ      1  ξ    1/\xi   in presence of the other compounds. In this case, the highest uncertainty is expected during determination of red compound - theoretically 2.38 times greater than during determination of its compound alone.  References   A.
