<h1>Diosdado Macapagal</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Diosdado Pangan Macapagal</strong> (September 28, 1910 – April 21, 1997) was the <a href="List_of_Presidents_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">ninth</a> <a href="President_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">President of the Philippines</a>, serving from 1961 to 1965, and the <a href="List_of_Vice_Presidents_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">sixth</a> <a href="Vice-President_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Vice-President</a>, serving from 1957 to 1961. He also served as a member of the <a href="House_of_Representatives_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">House of Representatives</a>, and headed the <a href="Philippine_Constitutional_Convention_election,_1970" title="wikilink">Constitutional Convention of 1970</a>. He is the father of <a href="Gloria_Macapagal-Arroyo" title="wikilink">Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</a>, who was the fourteenth President of the Philippines from 2001 to 2010.</p>

<p>A native of <a href="Lubao,_Pampanga" title="wikilink">Lubao, Pampanga</a>, Macapagal graduated from the <a href="University_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">University of the Philippines</a> and <a href="University_of_Santo_Tomas" title="wikilink">University of Santo Tomas</a>, after which he worked as a lawyer for the government. He first won election in 1949 to the <a href="House_of_Representatives_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">House of Representatives</a>, representing a district in his home province of <a class="uri" href="Pampanga" title="wikilink">Pampanga</a>. In 1957, he became Vice-President under the rule of President <a href="Carlos_P._García" title="wikilink">Carlos P. García</a>, whom he defeated in the <a href="Philippine_presidential_election,_1961" title="wikilink">1961 polls</a>.</p>

<p>As President, Macapagal worked to suppress graft and corruption and to stimulate the Philippine economy. He introduced the country's first <a href="land_reform" title="wikilink">land reform</a> law, placed the peso on the free currency exchange market, and liberalized foreign exchange and import controls. Many of his reforms, however, were crippled by a Congress dominated by the rival <a href="Nacionalista_Party_(Philippines)" title="wikilink">Nacionalista Party</a>. He is also known for shifting the country's observance of Independence Day from July 4 to June 12, commemorating the day President <a href="Emilio_Aguinaldo" title="wikilink">Emilio Aguinaldo</a> unilaterally declared the independence of the <a href="First_Philippine_Republic" title="wikilink">First Philippine Republic</a> from the <a href="Spanish_Empire" title="wikilink">Spanish Empire</a> in 1898. He stood for re-election in 1965, and was defeated by <a href="Ferdinand_Marcos" title="wikilink">Ferdinand Marcos</a>, who subsequently <a href="History_of_the_Philippines_(1965-1986)" title="wikilink">ruled for 21 years</a>.</p>

<p>Under Marcos, Macapagal was elected president of the <a href="Philippine_Constitutional_Convention_election,_1970" title="wikilink">Constitutional Convention</a> which would later draft what became the <a href="Constitution_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">1973 Constitution</a>, though the manner in which the charter was ratified and modified led him to later question its legitimacy. He died of heart failure, <a class="uri" href="pneumonia" title="wikilink">pneumonia</a>, and <a href="renal_failure" title="wikilink">renal</a> complications, in 1997, at the age of 86.</p>

<p>At the start of legislative sessions in 1950, the members of the House of Representatives elected Macapagal as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and he was given several important foreign assignments.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> He was a Philippine delegate to the <a href="United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">United Nations General Assembly</a> multiple times, notably distinguishing himself in debates over Communist aggression with <a href="Andrei_Vishinsky" title="wikilink">Andrei Vishinsky</a> and <a href="Jacob_Malik" title="wikilink">Jacob Malik</a> of the Soviet Union.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> He took part in negotiations for the <a href="Mutual_Defense_Treaty_(US-Philippines)" title="wikilink">U.S.-R.P.

<p>As a Representative, Macapagal authored and sponsored several laws of socio-economic importance, particularly aimed at benefiting the rural areas and the poor. Among the pieces of legislation which Macapagal promoted were the Minimum Wage Law, Rural Health Law, Rural Bank Law, the Law on Barrio Councils, the Barrio Industrialization Law, and a law nationalizing the rice and corn industries.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> He was consistently selected by the Congressional Press Club as one of the Ten Outstanding Congressmen during his tenure.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In his second term, he was named <strong>Most Outstanding lawmaker</strong> of the 3rd Congress .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="vice-presidency">Vice presidency</h2>

<p>In the <a href="Philippine_general_election,_1957" title="wikilink">1957 general election</a>, the <a href="Liberal_Party_(Philippines)" title="wikilink">Liberal Party</a> drafted Representative Macapagal to run for Vice President as the running-mate of <a href="José_Yulo" title="wikilink">José Yulo</a>, a former <a href="Speaker_of_the_Philippine_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Speaker of the House of Representatives</a>.

Laurel, Jr.</a>, by over eight percentage points. A month after the election, he was also chosen as the head of the Liberal Party.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>As the first ever Philippine vice president to be elected from a rival party of the president, Macapagal served out his four-year vice presidential term as a leader of the <a href="opposition_(government)" title="wikilink">opposition</a>. The ruling party refused to give him a <a href="Cabinet_(government)" title="wikilink">Cabinet position</a> in the Garcia administration, which was a break from tradition.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> He was offered a position in the Cabinet only on the condition that he switch allegiance to the ruling Nationalista Party, but he declined the offer and instead played the role of critic to the administration's policies and performance.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> This allowed him to capitalize on the increasing unpopularity of the Garcia administration. Assigned to performing only ceremonial duties as vice president, he spent his time making frequent trips to the countryside to acquaint himself with voters and to promote the image of the Liberal Party.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>In the <a href="Philippine_general_election,_1961" title="wikilink">1961 presidential election</a>, Macapagal ran against Garcia's re-election bid, promising an end to corruption and appealing to the electorate as a common man from humble beginnings.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> He defeated the incumbent president with a 55% to 45% margin.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> His inauguration as the president of the Philippines took place on December 30, 1961.</p>

<p>In his inaugural address, Macapagal promised a socio-economic program anchored on "a return to free and private enterprise", placing economic development in the hands of private entrepreneurs with minimal government interference.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>Twenty days after the inauguration, exchange controls were lifted and the <a href="Philippine_peso" title="wikilink">Philippine peso</a> was allowed to float on the free currency exchange market. The currency controls were initially adopted by the administration of <a href="Elpidio_Quirino" title="wikilink">Elpidio Quirino</a> as a temporary measure, but continued to be adopted by succeeding administrations. The peso devalued from P2.64 to the U.S. dollar, and stabilized at P3.80 to the dollar, supported by a $300 million stabilization fund from the <a href="International_Monetary_Fund" title="wikilink">International Monetary Fund</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>To achieve the national goal of <a class="uri" href="economic" title="wikilink">economic</a> and social progress with prosperity reaching down to the masses, there existed a choice of methods. First, there was the choice between the <a href="democracy" title="wikilink">democratic</a> and <a href="dictator" title="wikilink">dictatorial</a> systems, the latter prevailing in <a href="Communism" title="wikilink">Communist</a> countries. On this, the choice was easy as Filipinos had long been committed to the democratic method.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> With the democratic mechanism, however, the next choice was between <a href="free_enterprise" title="wikilink">free enterprise</a> and the continuing of the controls system. Macapagal stated the essence of free enterprise in layman parlance in declaring before Congress on January 22, 1962 that "the task of economic development belongs principally to private enterprise and not to the government.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>Before independence there was free enterprise in the Philippines under Presidents <a href="Manuel_Quezon" title="wikilink">Manuel Quezon</a>, <a href="Sergio_Osmeña" title="wikilink">Sergio Osmeña</a> and <a href="Manuel_Roxas" title="wikilink">Manuel Roxas</a>. In 1950 President <a href="Elpidio_Quirino" title="wikilink">Elpidio Quirino</a> deviated from free enterprise launching as a temporary emergency measure the system of exchange and import controls. The controls system was carried on by President Magsaysay and Garcia.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p>The first fundamental decision Macapagal had to make was whether to continue the system of exchange controls of Quirino, Magsaysay and Garcia or to return to the free enterprise of Quezon, Osmena and Roxas.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> It had been his view since he was a Congressman for eight years that the suitable economic system for Filipinos was free enterprise. So on January 21, 1962 after working for 20 straight hours he signed a Central Bank decree abolishing exchange controls and returning the country to free enterprise.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

<p>During the 20 days available to make a decision on choice between controls and free enterprise, between his inauguration as President and before the opening of <a href="Congress_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Congress</a>, Macapagal's main adviser was Governor Andres Castillo of the <a href="Central_Bank_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Central Bank</a>.</p>

<p>Further reform efforts by Macapagal were blocked by the Nacionalistas, who dominated the House of Representatives and the Senate at that time. Nonetheless, Macapagal was able to achieve steady economic progress, and annual GDP growth averaged at 5.53% for 1962–65.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p>The removal of controls and the restoration of free enterprise was intended to provide only the fundamental setting in which Macapagal could work out economic and social progress.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> A specific and periodic program for the guidance of both the private sector and the government was an essential instrument to attain the economic and social development that constituted the goal of his labors.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p>Such a program for his administration was formulated under his authority and direction by a group of able and reputable economic and business leaders the most active and effective of which was Sixto Roxas III. From an examination of the planned targets and requirements of the Five-Year program – formally known as the Five-Year Socio-Economic Integrated Development Program – it could be seen that it aimed at the following objectives.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>immediate restoration of <a href="economic_stability" title="wikilink">economic stability</a>;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>alleviating the plight of the common man; and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>establishing a dynamic basic for future growth.</li>
</ul>

<p>Free enterprise was restored with decontrol. The Five-Year Economic Program had been prescribed. Land reform abolishing tenancy had been launched. These were essential foundations for economic and social progress for the greatest number.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p>The essential foundations having been laid, attention must then be turned to the equally difficult task of building the main <a class="uri" href="edifice" title="wikilink">edifice</a> by implementing the economic program. Although the success of Macapagal's Socio-Economic Program in free enterprise inherently depended on the private sector, it would be helpful and necessary for the government to render active assistance in its implementation by the citizens.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p>Such role of the government in <a href="free_enterprise" title="wikilink">free enterprise</a>, in the view of Macapagal, required it (1) to provide the social overhead like roads, airfields and ports that directly or proximately promote economic growth, (2) to adopt fiscal and monetary policies salutary to investments, and most importantly (3) to serve as an entrepreneur or promote of basic and key private industries, particularly those that require capital too large for businessmen to put up by themselves. Among the enterprises he selected for active government promotion were <a href="steel_mill#Integrated_mill" title="wikilink">integrated steel</a>, <a class="uri" href="fertilizer" title="wikilink">fertilizer</a>, <a href="pulp_(paper)" title="wikilink">pulp</a>, meat <a class="uri" href="canning" title="wikilink">canning</a> and <a class="uri" href="tourism" title="wikilink">tourism</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="land-reform">Land reform</h4>

<p>Like <a href="Ramon_Magsaysay" title="wikilink">Ramon Magsaysay</a>, President Diosdado Macapagal came from the masses. He savored calling himself the "Poor boy from Lubao".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Ironically, he had little popularity among the masses.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> This could be attributed to an absence any charismatic appeal owing to his stiff personality.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> But despite this, Macapagal had certain achievements.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Foremost of these was the Agricultural Land Reform Code of 1963 (Republic Act No. 3844) which provided for the purchase of private farmlands with the intention of distributing them in small lots to the landless tenants on easy term of payment.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> It is a major development in history of <a href="land_reform_in_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">land reform in the Philippines</a>,</p>

<p>In comparison with the previous agrarian legislation, the law lowered the retention limit to 75 hectares, whether owned by individuals or corporations. It removed the term "contiguous" and established the <a class="uri" href="leasehold" title="wikilink">leasehold</a> system.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> The share-<a class="uri" href="tenancy" title="wikilink">tenancy</a> or the <em>kasama</em> system was prohibited.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> It formulated a <a href="bill_of_rights" title="wikilink">bill of rights</a> that assured agricultural workers the right to self-organization and to a <a href="minimum_wage" title="wikilink">minimum wage</a>. It also created an office that acquired and distributed farmlands and a financing institution for this purpose.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The major flaw of this law was, however, that it had several exemptions, such as ort (big capital <a class="uri" href="plantations" title="wikilink">plantations</a> established during the <a href="History_of_the_Philippines_(1521–1898)" title="wikilink">Spanish</a> and <a href="History_of_the_Philippines_(1898–1946)" title="wikilink">American</a> periods); fishponds, saltbeds, and lands primarily planted to <a class="uri" href="citrus" title="wikilink">citrus</a>, <a class="uri" href="coconuts" title="wikilink">coconuts</a>, <a href="Theobroma_cacao" title="wikilink">cacao</a>, <a href="Coffee_bean" title="wikilink">coffee</a>, <a class="uri" href="durian" title="wikilink">durian</a>, and other similar permanent trees; landholdings converted to <a href="Residential_property" title="wikilink">residential</a>, <a href="Commercial_property" title="wikilink">commercial</a>, <a href="industrial_property" title="wikilink">industrial</a>, or other similar non-agricultural purposes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p>It was viewed that the 75-hectare retention limit was just too high for the growing population density. Moreover, this law merely allowed the transfer of the <a href="landlord" title="wikilink">landlordism</a> from one area to another.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> This was because landlords were paid in bonds, which he could use to purchase agricultural lands.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Likewise, the farmer was free to choose to be excluded from the <a class="uri" href="leasehold" title="wikilink">leasehold</a> arrangements if he volunteered to give up the landholdings to the landlord.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>Within two years after the law was implemented, no<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> land was being purchased under its term and conditions caused by the <a href="peasant" title="wikilink">peasants</a>' inability to purchase the land.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Besides, the <a href="Philippine_Government" title="wikilink">government</a> seemed lacking of strong political will, as shown by the <a href="Congress_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Congress</a>' allotment of only one million <a href="Philippine_peso" title="wikilink">Philippine pesos</a> for the implementation of this code. At least Php200 million was needed within a year from the enactment and implementation of the code, and Php300 million in the next three years for the program to be successful. However, by 1972, the code had benefited only 4,500 peasants covering 68 estates, at the cost of Php57 million to the government. Consequently, by the 1970s, the farmers ended up tilling less land, with their share in the farm also being less.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> They incurred more debts, depending on the <a class="uri" href="landlord" title="wikilink">landlord</a>, <a href="creditor" title="wikilink">creditors</a>, and <a href="rice" title="wikilink">palay</a> buyers. Indeed, during the administration of Macapagal, the productivity of the <a class="uri" href="farmers" title="wikilink">farmers</a> further declined.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="anti-corruption-drive">Anti-corruption drive</h4>

<p>One of Macapagal's major campaign pledges had been to clean out the government corruption that had proliferated under former President Garcia.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The administration also openly feuded with Filipino businessmen <a href="Fernando_Lopez" title="wikilink">Fernando Lopez</a> and <a href="Eugenio_Lopez,_Sr." title="wikilink">Eugenio Lopez</a>, brothers who had controlling interests in several large businesses.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The administration alluded to the brothers as "Filipino Stonehills who build and maintain business empires through political power, including the corruption of politicians and other officials".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> In the <a href="Philippine_general_election,_1965" title="wikilink">1965 election</a>, the Lopezes threw their support behind Macapagal's rival, <a href="Ferdinand_Marcos" title="wikilink">Ferdinand Marcos</a>, with Fernando Lopez serving Marcos' running mate.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="stonehill-controversy">Stonehill controversy</h5>

<p>The Administration's campaign against corruption was tested by <a href="Harry_Stonehill" title="wikilink">Harry Stonehill</a>, an American expatriate with a $50-million business empire in the Philippines.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Macapagal's Secretary of Justice, <a href="Jose_W._Diokno" title="wikilink">Jose W.

Macapagal, however, prevented Diokno from prosecuting Stonehill by deporting the American instead, then dismissing Diokno from the cabinet. Diokno questioned Macapagal's actions, saying, "How can the government now prosecute the corrupted when it has allowed the corrupter to go?"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Diokno later served as a <a href="Senate_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Senator of the Republic</a>.</p>
<h4 id="independence-day">Independence Day</h4>

<p>Macapagal appealed to nationalist sentiments by shifting the commemoration of Philippine independence day. On May 12, 1962, he signed a proclamation which declared Tuesday, June 12, 1962, as a special public holiday in commemoration of the declaration of independence from Spain on that date in 1898.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> The change became permanent in 1964 with the signing of Republic Act No. 4166.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> For having issued his 1962 proclamation, Macapagal is generally credited with having moved the celebration date of the Independence Day holiday.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn83" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Years later, Macapagal told journalist <a href="Stanley_Karnow" title="wikilink">Stanley Karnow</a> the real reason for the change: "When I was in the diplomatic corps, I noticed that nobody came to our receptions on the <a href="Fourth_of_July" title="wikilink">Fourth of July</a>, but went to the American Embassy instead.

<h4 id="maphilindo">Maphilindo</h4>

<p>In July 1963, President Diosdado Macapagal convened a summit meeting in Manila in which a nonpolitical confederation for Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia, <a class="uri" href="Maphilindo" title="wikilink">Maphilindo</a>, was proposed as a realization of <a href="José_Rizal" title="wikilink">José Rizal</a>'s dream of bringing together the Malay peoples, seen as artificially divided by colonial frontiers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn94" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>

<p>Maphilindo was described as a regional association that would approach issues of common concern in the spirit of consensus. However, it was also perceived as a tactic on the parts of <a class="uri" href="Jakarta" title="wikilink">Jakarta</a> and <a class="uri" href="Manila" title="wikilink">Manila</a> to delay, or even prevent, the formation of the <a href="Federation_of_Malaysia" title="wikilink">Federation of Malaysia</a>.

The plan failed when <a class="uri" href="Sukarno" title="wikilink">Sukarno</a> adopted his plan of "<a class="uri" href="konfrontasi" title="wikilink">konfrontasi</a>" with Malaysia. The Konfrontasi, or Confrontation basically aimed at preventing Malaysia from attaining independence. The idea was inspired onto President Sukarno by the Partai Komunis Indonesia (PKI), or literally the <a href="Indonesian_Communist_Party" title="wikilink">Indonesian Communist Party</a>. The party convinced President Sukarno that the formation of Malaysia is a form of <a href="neocolonialism" title="wikilink">neo-colonization</a> and would affect tranquility in Indonesia.

<p>The <a href="United_States_Government" title="wikilink">U.S. government</a>'s active interest in bringing other nations into the war had been part of U.S. policy discussions as early as 1961. President <a href="Lyndon_Johnson" title="wikilink">Lyndon Johnson</a> first publicly appealed for other countries to come to the aid of South Vietnam on April 23, 1964–in what was called the "More Flags" program.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn98" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Chester Cooper, former director of Asian affairs for the White House, explained why the impetus came from the United States instead of from the Republic of South Vietnam: "The 'More Flags' campaign ... required the application of considerable pressure for Washington to elicit any meaningful commitments.

<p> Macapagal announced his retirement from politics following his 1965 loss to Marcos. In 1971, he was elected president of the <a href="Constitutional_convention_(political_meeting)" title="wikilink">constitutional convention</a> that drafted what became the 1973 constitution. The manner in which the charter was ratified and later modified led him to later question its legitimacy. In 1979, he formed the National Union for Liberation as a political party to oppose the Marcos regime.</p>

<p>Following the restoration of democracy in 1986, Macapagal took on the role of elder <a href="Politician" title="wikilink">statesman</a>, and was a member of the <a href="Philippine_Council_of_State" title="wikilink">Philippine Council of State</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn103" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> He also served as honorary chairman of the National Centennial Commission, and chairman of the board of CAP Life, among others.</p>

<p>In his retirement, Macapagal devoted much of his time to reading and writing.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn104" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> He published his presidential memoir, authored several books about government and economics, and wrote a weekly column for the <em><a href="Manila_Bulletin" title="wikilink">Manila Bulletin</a></em> newspaper.</p>
