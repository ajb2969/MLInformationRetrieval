   Polar homology      Polar homology   In complex geometry , a polar homology is a group which captures holomorphic invariants of a complex manifold in a similar way to usual homology of a manifold in differential topology . Polar homology was defined by B. Khesin and A. Rosly in 1999.  Definition  Let M be a complex projective manifold . The space    C  k     subscript  C  k    C_{k}   of polar k -chains is a vector space over   ℂ   ℂ   {\mathbb{C}}   defined as a quotient     A  k   /   R  k        subscript  A  k    subscript  R  k     A_{k}/R_{k}   , with    A  k     subscript  A  k    A_{k}   and    R  k     subscript  R  k    R_{k}   vector spaces defined below.  Defining    A  k     subscript  A  k    A_{k}     The space    A  k     subscript  A  k    A_{k}   is freely generated by the triples    (  X  ,  f  ,  α  )     X  f  α    (X,f,\alpha)   , where X is a smooth, k -dimensional complex manifold,    f  :   X  ↦  M      normal-:  f   maps-to  X  M     f:\;X\mapsto M   a holomorphic map, and   α   α   \alpha   is a rational k -form on X , with first order poles on a divisor with normal crossing .  Defining    R  k     subscript  R  k    R_{k}     The space    R  k     subscript  R  k    R_{k}   is generated by the following relations.        λ   (  X  ,  f  ,  α  )    =   (  X  ,  f  ,   λ  α   )         λ   X  f  α     X  f    λ  α      \lambda(X,f,\alpha)=(X,f,\lambda\alpha)          (  X  ,  f  ,  α  )   =  0       X  f  α   0    (X,f,\alpha)=0   if     dim   f   (  X  )     <  k       dimension    f  X    k    \dim f(X)   .        ∑  i    (   X  i   ,   f  i   ,   α  i   )    =  0        subscript   i     subscript  X  i    subscript  f  i    subscript  α  i     0    \ \sum_{i}(X_{i},f_{i},\alpha_{i})=0   provided that            ∑  i     f   i  *     α  i     ≡  0   ,        subscript   i      subscript  f   i      subscript  α  i     0    \sum_{i}f_{i*}\alpha_{i}\equiv 0,         where        d  i   m    f  i    (   X  i   )    =  k        d  i  m   subscript  f  i    subscript  X  i    k    dim\;f_{i}(X_{i})=k   for all   i   i   i   and the push-forwards     f   i  *     α  i        subscript  f   i      subscript  α  i     f_{i*}\alpha_{i}   are considered on the smooth part of     ∪  i     f  i    (   X  i   )        subscript   i      subscript  f  i    subscript  X  i      \cup_{i}f_{i}(X_{i})   .  Defining the boundary operator  The boundary operator    ∂  :    C  k   ↦   C   k  -  1        normal-:    maps-to   subscript  C  k    subscript  C    k  1       \partial:\;C_{k}\mapsto C_{k-1}   is defined by       ∂   (  X  ,  f  ,  α  )    =   2  π    -  1      ∑  i    (   V  i   ,   f  i   ,   r  e    s   V  i     α   )           X  f  α     2  π      1      subscript   i     subscript  V  i    subscript  f  i     r  e   subscript  s   subscript  V  i    α        \partial(X,f,\alpha)=2\pi\sqrt{-1}\sum_{i}(V_{i},f_{i},res_{V_{i}}\,\alpha)   ,  where    V  i     subscript  V  i    V_{i}   are components of the polar divisor of   α   α   \alpha   , res is the Poincaré residue , and     f  i   =    f  |    V  i         subscript  f  i    evaluated-at  f   subscript  V  i      f_{i}=f|_{V_{i}}   are restrictions of the map f to each component of the divisor.  Khesin and Rosly proved that this boundary operator is well defined, and satisfies     ∂  2   =  0       superscript   2   0    \partial^{2}=0   . They defined the polar cohomology as the quotient     ker  ∂   /   im  ∂        ker     im      \operatorname{ker}\;\partial/\operatorname{im}\;\partial   .  Notes   B. Khesin, A.
