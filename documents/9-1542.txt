Polar homology

In complex geometry, a polar homology is a group which captures holomorphic invariants of a complex manifold in a similar way to usual homology of a manifold in differential topology. Polar homology was defined by B. Khesin and A. Rosly in 1999.
Definition
Let M be a complex projective manifold. The space 
 
 
 
  of polar k-chains is a vector space over 
 
 
 
  defined as a quotient 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  vector spaces defined below.
Defining 
 
 

The space 
 
 
 
  is freely generated by the triples 
 
 
 
 , where X is a smooth, k-dimensional complex manifold, 
 
 
 
  a holomorphic map, and 
 
 
 
  is a rational k-form on X, with first order poles on a divisor with normal crossing.
Defining 
 
 

The space 
 
 
 
  is generated by the following relations.

  for all 
 
 
 
  and the push-forwards 
 
 
 
  are considered on the smooth part of 
 
 
 
 .
Defining the boundary operator
The boundary operator 
 
 
 
  is defined by


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  are components of the polar divisor of 
 
 
 
 , res is the Poincar√© residue, and 
 
 
 
  are restrictions of the map f to each component of the divisor.
Khesin and Rosly proved that this boundary operator is well defined, and satisfies 
 
 
 
 . They defined the polar cohomology as the quotient 
 
 
 
 .
