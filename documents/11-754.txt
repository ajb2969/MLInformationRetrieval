N-carbamoylputrescine amidase

In enzymology, a N-carbamoylputrescine amidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-carbamoylputrescine + H2O 
 
 
 
  putrescine + CO2 + NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-carbamoylputrescine and H2O, whereas its 3 products are putrescine, CO2, and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase. Other names in common use include carbamoylputrescine hydrolase, and NCP. This enzyme participates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups.
