Siddhaṃ script

, also known in its later evolved form as Siddhamātṛkā,1 is the name of a script used for writing Sanskrit during the period ca 600-1200 CE. It is descended from the Brahmi script via the Gupta script, which gave rise to the Assamese script, Bengali script, Tibetan script and also inspired Japanese kana script. There is some confusion over the spelling:  and  both common, though  is preferred correct.2 The script is a refinement of the script used during the Gupta Empire. The name arose from the practice of writing the word , or  (may there be perfection) at the head of documents.
The word  () means "accomplished" or "perfected". Other names of the script include siddhông (), siḍ·ḍhaṃ (Tibetan: ), bonji () and .
is an abugida or alphasyllabary rather than an alphabet because each character indicates a syllable, but it does not include every possible syllable. If no other mark occurs then the short 'a' is assumed. Diacritic marks indicate the other vowels, the pure nasal, and the aspirated vowel. A special mark can be used to indicate that the letter stands alone with no vowel, which sometimes happens at the end of Sanskrit words.
History
 
Many of the Buddhist texts which were taken to China along the Silk Road were written using a version of the  script. This continued to evolve, and minor variations are seen across time, and in different regions. Importantly it was used for transmitting the Buddhist tantra texts. At the time it was considered important to preserve the pronunciation of mantras, and Chinese was not suitable for writing the sounds of Sanskrit. This led to the retention of the  Script in East Asia. The practice of writing using  survived in East Asia where Tantric Buddhism persisted.
Kūkai introduced the  script to Japan when he returned from China in 806, where he studied Sanskrit with Nalanda-trained monks including one known as Prajñā. By the time Kūkai learned this script, the trading and pilgrimage routes over land to India, were closed by the expanding Islamic empire of the Abbasids.
In Japan the writing of mantras and copying of Sutras using the  script is still practiced in the esoteric Buddhist schools of Shingon and Tendai as well as in the syncretic sect of Shugendō. The characters are known as  or . The Taisho edition of the Chinese  preserves the  characters for most mantras, and Korean Buddhists still write seed syllables in a modified form of . A recent innovation is the writing of Japanese language slogans on T-shirts using Bonji. Japanese  has evolved from the original script used to write sūtras and is now somewhat different from the ancient script.
It is more typical to see  written with brushes like Chinese writing, and is also written with a bamboo pen; in Japan, a special brush called a  is used for formal  calligraphy.
In the middle of the 9th century, China experienced a series of purges of "foreign religions", thus cutting Japan off from the sources of  texts. In time, other scripts, particularly Devanagari replaced  in India, while in Bengal,  evolved to become the Bengali script, leaving East Asia as the only region where  is used.

Siddhaṃ Fonts
is still largely a hand written script. Some efforts have been made to create computer fonts though to date none of these are capable of reproducing all of the  conjunct consonants. Notably the Chinese Buddhist Electronic Texts Association have created a  font for their electronic version of the Taisho , though this does not contain all possible conjuncts. The software Mojikyo also contains fonts for Siddham, but split Siddham in different blocks and needs different fonts to render one document.
A  input system relies on the CBETA font, Siddhamkey 3.0 has been produced.
Unicode
Siddham script was added to the Unicode Standard in June 2014 with the release of version 7.0.
The Unicode block for Siddham is U+11580–U+115FF:
