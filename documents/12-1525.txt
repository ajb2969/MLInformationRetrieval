Eight-vertex model

In statistical mechanics, the eight-vertex model is a generalisation of the ice-type (six-vertex) models; it was discussed by Sutherland,1 and Fan & Wu,2 and solved by Baxter in the zero-field case.3
Description
As with the ice-type models, the eight-vertex model is a square lattice model, where each state is a configuration of arrows at a vertex. The allowed vertices have an even number of arrows pointing towards the vertex; these include the six inherited from the ice-type model (1-6), and sinks and sources (7, 8).

We consider a 
 
 
 
  lattice, with 
 
 
 
  vertices and 
 
 
 
  edges. Imposing periodic boundary conditions requires that the states 7 and 8 occur equally often, as do states 5 and 6, and thus can be taken to have the same energy. For the zero-field case the same is true for the two other pairs of states. Each vertex 
 
 
 
  has an associated energy 
 
 
 
  and Boltzmann weight

 
 , giving the partition function over the lattice as


 
  where the summation is over all allowed configurations of vertices in the lattice. In this general form the partition function remains unsolved.
Solution in the zero-field case
The zero-field case of the model corresponds physically to the absence of external electric fields. Hence, the model remains unchanged under the reversal of all arrows; the states 1 and 2, and 3 and 4, consequently must occur as pairs. The vertices can be assigned arbitrary weights



The solution is based on the observation that rows in transfer matrices commute, for a certain parametrisation of these four Boltzmann weights. This came about as a modification of an alternate solution for the six-vertex model; it makes use of elliptic theta functions.
Commuting transfer matrices
The proof relies on the fact that when 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , for quantities


 
 
  the transfer matrices 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (associated with the weights 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 ) commute. Using the star-triangle relation, Baxter reformulated this condition as equivalent to a parametrisation of the weights given as


 
  for fixed modulus 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and variable 
 
 
 
 . Here snh is the hyperbolic analogue of sn, given by


 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are Jacobi elliptic functions of modulus 
 
 
 
 . The associated transfer matrix 
 
 
 
  thus is a function of 
 
 
 
  alone; for all 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 




The matrix function 
 
 

The other crucial part of the solution is the existence of a nonsingular matrix-valued function 
 
 
 
 , such that for all complex 
 
 
 
  the matrices 
 
 
 
  commute with each other and the transfer matrices, and satisfy  where



The existence and commutation relations of such a function are demonstrated by considering pair propagations through a vertex, and periodicity relations of the theta functions, in a similar way to the six-vertex model.
Explicit solution
The commutation of matrices in () allow them to be diagonalised, and thus eigenvalues can be found. The partition function is calculated from the maximal eigenvalue, resulting in a free energy per site of


 
 
  for


 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the complete elliptic integrals of moduli 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The eight vertex model was also solved in quasicrystals.
Equivalence with an Ising model
There is a natural correspondence between the eight-vertex model, and the Ising model with 2-spin and 4-spin nearest neighbour interactions. The states of this model are spins 
 
 
 
  on faces of a square lattice. The analogue of 'edges' in the eight-vertex model are products of spins on adjacent faces:

The most general form of the energy for this model is


 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  describe the horizontal, vertical and two diagonal 2-spin interactions, and 
 
 
 
  describes the 4-spin interaction between four faces at a vertex; the sum is over the whole lattice.

Isinginteractions

We denote horizontal and vertical spins (arrows on edges) in the eight-vertex model 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  respectively, and define up and right as positive directions. The restriction on vertex states is that the product of four edges at a vertex is 1; this automatically holds for Ising 'edges'. Each 
 
 
 
  configuration then corresponds to a unique 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  configuration, whereas each 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  configuration gives two choices of 
 
 
 
  configurations.
Equating general forms of Boltzmann weights for each vertex 
 
 
 
 , the following relations between the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  define the correspondence between the lattice models:



It follows that in the zero-field case of the eight-vertex model, the horizontal and vertical interactions in the corresponding Ising model vanish.
These relations gives the equivalence 
 
 
 
  between the partition functions of the eight-vertex model, and the 2,4-spin Ising model. Consequently a solution in either model would lead immediately to a solution in the other.
