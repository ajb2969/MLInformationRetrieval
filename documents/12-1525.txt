   Eight-vertex model      Eight-vertex model   In statistical mechanics , the eight-vertex model is a generalisation of the ice-type (six-vertex) models ; it was discussed by Sutherland, 1 and Fan & Wu, 2 and solved by Baxter in the zero-field case. 3  Description  As with the ice-type models, the eight-vertex model is a square lattice model , where each state is a configuration of arrows at a vertex. The allowed vertices have an even number of arrows pointing towards the vertex; these include the six inherited from the ice-type model (1-6), and sinks and sources (7, 8).  (Figure)  Eightvertex2   We consider a    N  ×  N      N  N    N\times N   lattice, with    N  2     superscript  N  2    N^{2}   vertices and    2   N  2       2   superscript  N  2     2N^{2}   edges. Imposing periodic boundary conditions requires that the states 7 and 8 occur equally often, as do states 5 and 6, and thus can be taken to have the same energy. For the zero-field case the same is true for the two other pairs of states. Each vertex   j   j   j   has an associated energy    ϵ  j     subscript  ϵ  j    \epsilon_{j}   and Boltzmann weight      w  j   =   e   -    ϵ  j    k  T           subscript  w  j    superscript  e       subscript  ϵ  j     k  T        w_{j}=e^{-\frac{\epsilon_{j}}{kT}}   , giving the partition function over the lattice as      Z  =   ∑   exp   (   -     ∑  j     n  j    ϵ  j      k  T     )         Z            subscript   j      subscript  n  j    subscript  ϵ  j       k  T         Z=\sum\exp\left(-\frac{\sum_{j}n_{j}\epsilon_{j}}{kT}\right)   where the summation is over all allowed configurations of vertices in the lattice. In this general form the partition function remains unsolved.  Solution in the zero-field case  The zero-field case of the model corresponds physically to the absence of external electric fields. Hence, the model remains unchanged under the reversal of all arrows; the states 1 and 2, and 3 and 4, consequently must occur as pairs. The vertices can be assigned arbitrary weights       w  1   =   w  2        subscript  w  1    subscript  w  2     \displaystyle w_{1}=w_{2}     The solution is based on the observation that rows in transfer matrices commute, for a certain parametrisation of these four Boltzmann weights. This came about as a modification of an alternate solution for the six-vertex model ; it makes use of elliptic theta functions .  Commuting transfer matrices  The proof relies on the fact that when     Δ  ′   =  Δ       superscript  normal-Δ  normal-′   normal-Δ    \Delta^{\prime}=\Delta   and     Γ  ′   =  Γ       superscript  normal-Γ  normal-′   normal-Γ    \Gamma^{\prime}=\Gamma   , for quantities     Δ   normal-Δ   \displaystyle\Delta   the transfer matrices   T   T   T   and    T  ′     superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}   (associated with the weights   a   a   a   ,   b   b   b   ,   c   c   c   ,   d   d   d   and    a  ′     superscript  a  normal-′    a^{\prime}   ,    b  ′     superscript  b  normal-′    b^{\prime}   ,    c  ′     superscript  c  normal-′    c^{\prime}   ,    d  ′     superscript  d  normal-′    d^{\prime}   ) commute. Using the star-triangle relation , Baxter reformulated this condition as equivalent to a parametrisation of the weights given as      a  :  b  :  c  :   d  =   snh   (   η  -  u   )     :   snh   (   η  +  u   )    :   snh   (   2  η   )    :   k   snh   (   2  η   )     snh   (   η  -  u   )     snh   (   η  +  u   )          normal-:  a  b    normal-:    c    normal-:      d   snh    η  u       normal-:     snh    η  u      normal-:     snh    2  η      normal-:      k   snh    2  η     snh    η  u     snh    η  u        a:b:c:d=\operatorname{snh}(\eta-u):\operatorname{snh}(\eta+u):\operatorname{%
 snh}(2\eta):k\operatorname{snh}(2\eta)\operatorname{snh}(\eta-u)\operatorname{%
 snh}(\eta+u)   for fixed modulus   k   k   k   and   η   η   \eta   and variable   u   u   u   . Here snh is the hyperbolic analogue of sn, given by      snh   (  u  )      snh  u    \displaystyle\operatorname{snh}(u)   and    H   (  u  )       H  u    H(u)   and    Θ   (  u  )       normal-Θ  u    \Theta(u)   are Jacobi elliptic functions of modulus   k   k   k   . The associated transfer matrix   T   T   T   thus is a function of   u   u   u   alone; for all   u   u   u   ,   v   v   v           T   (  u  )   T   (  v  )    =   T   (  v  )   T   (  u  )     .        T  u  T  v     T  v  T  u     T(u)T(v)=T(v)T(u).     The matrix function    Q   (  u  )       Q  u    Q(u)     The other crucial part of the solution is the existence of a nonsingular matrix-valued function   Q   Q   Q   , such that for all complex   u   u   u   the matrices     Q   (  u  )    ,   Q   (   u  ′   )         Q  u     Q   superscript  u  normal-′      Q(u),Q(u^{\prime})   commute with each other and the transfer matrices, and satisfy where      ζ   (  u  )       ζ  u    \displaystyle\zeta(u)     The existence and commutation relations of such a function are demonstrated by considering pair propagations through a vertex, and periodicity relations of the theta functions, in a similar way to the six-vertex model.  Explicit solution  The commutation of matrices in () allow them to be diagonalised , and thus eigenvalues can be found. The partition function is calculated from the maximal eigenvalue, resulting in a free energy per site of      f  =    ϵ  5   -   2  k  T     ∑   n  =  1   ∞         sinh  2    (    (   τ  -  λ   )   n   )     (    cosh   (   n  λ   )    -   cosh   (   n  α   )     )     n   sinh   (   2  n  τ   )     cosh   (   n  λ   )              f     subscript  ϵ  5     2  k  T    superscript   subscript     n  1            superscript   2       τ  λ   n          n  λ        n  α        n      2  n  τ        n  λ           \displaystyle f=\epsilon_{5}-2kT\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sinh^{2}((\tau-%
 \lambda)n)(\cosh(n\lambda)-\cosh(n\alpha))}{n\sinh(2n\tau)\cosh(n\lambda)}   for     τ   τ   \displaystyle\tau   where   K   K   K   and    K  ′     superscript  K  normal-′    K^{\prime}   are the complete elliptic integrals of moduli   k   k   k   and    k  ′     superscript  k  normal-′    k^{\prime}   . The eight vertex model was also solved in quasicrystals .  Equivalence with an Ising model  There is a natural correspondence between the eight-vertex model, and the Ising model with 2-spin and 4-spin nearest neighbour interactions. The states of this model are spins    σ  =   ±  1       σ   plus-or-minus  1     \sigma=\pm 1   on faces of a square lattice. The analogue of 'edges' in the eight-vertex model are products of spins on adjacent faces:      α   i  j      subscript  α    i  j     \displaystyle\alpha_{ij}     (Figure)  Isingduallattice   The most general form of the energy for this model is     ϵ   ϵ   \displaystyle\epsilon   where    J  h     subscript  J  h    J_{h}   ,    J  v     subscript  J  v    J_{v}   ,   J   J   J   ,    J  ′     superscript  J  normal-′    J^{\prime}   describe the horizontal, vertical and two diagonal 2-spin interactions, and    J  ′′     superscript  J  ′′    J^{\prime\prime}   describes the 4-spin interaction between four faces at a vertex; the sum is over the whole lattice.  (Figure)  Isinginteractions   We denote horizontal and vertical spins (arrows on edges) in the eight-vertex model   μ   μ   \mu   ,   α   α   \alpha   respectively, and define up and right as positive directions. The restriction on vertex states is that the product of four edges at a vertex is 1; this automatically holds for Ising 'edges'. Each   σ   σ   \sigma   configuration then corresponds to a unique   μ   μ   \mu   ,   α   α   \alpha   configuration, whereas each   μ   μ   \mu   ,   α   α   \alpha   configuration gives two choices of   σ   σ   \sigma   configurations.  Equating general forms of Boltzmann weights for each vertex   j   j   j   , the following relations between the    ϵ  j     subscript  ϵ  j    \epsilon_{j}   and    J  h     subscript  J  h    J_{h}   ,    J  v     subscript  J  v    J_{v}   ,   J   J   J   ,    J  ′     superscript  J  normal-′    J^{\prime}   ,    J  ′′     superscript  J  ′′    J^{\prime\prime}   define the correspondence between the lattice models:      ϵ  1     subscript  ϵ  1    \displaystyle\epsilon_{1}     It follows that in the zero-field case of the eight-vertex model, the horizontal and vertical interactions in the corresponding Ising model vanish.  These relations gives the equivalence     Z  I   =   2   Z   8  V          subscript  Z  I     2   subscript  Z    8  V       Z_{I}=2Z_{8V}   between the partition functions of the eight-vertex model, and the 2,4-spin Ising model. Consequently a solution in either model would lead immediately to a solution in the other.
