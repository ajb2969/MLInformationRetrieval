   Parabolic geometry      Parabolic geometry   Parabolic geometry may refer to:   Euclidean geometry , where Euclidean space is viewed as the natural representation space of the group of Euclidean motions      E   (  n  )    =    O   (  n  )    ⋉   ℝ  n          E  n    left-normal-factor-semidirect-product    O  n    superscript  ℝ  n      E(n)=O(n)\ltimes\mathbb{R}^{n}     The geometry of a Riemannian manifold admitting no positive Green's function  Parabolic geometry (differential geometry) : The homogeneous space defined by a semisimple Lie group modulo a parabolic subgroup, or the curved analog of such a space   "
