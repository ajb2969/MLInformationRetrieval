   Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate synthase (glutamine hydrolyzing)      Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate synthase (glutamine hydrolyzing)   Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate synthase (glutamine hydrolyzing) (, PdxST ) is an enzyme with system name D-ribose 5-phosphate,D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-lyase . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   D-ribose 5-phosphate + D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + L-glutamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyridoxal 5'-phosphate + L- glutamate + 3 H 2 O + phosphate (overall reaction)  (1a) L-glutamine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-glutamate + NH 3   (1b) D-ribose 5-phosphate + D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + NH3   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyridoxal 5'-phosphate + 4 H 2 O + phosphate    The enzyme can also use ribulose 5-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate .
