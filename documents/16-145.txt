Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate synthase (glutamine hydrolyzing)

Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate synthase (glutamine hydrolyzing) (, PdxST) is an enzyme with system name D-ribose 5-phosphate,D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-lyase.12345678 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

D-ribose 5-phosphate + D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + L-glutamine 
 
 
 
  pyridoxal 5'-phosphate + L-glutamate + 3 H2O + phosphate (overall reaction)
 
(1a) L-glutamine + H2O 
 
 
 
  L-glutamate + NH3

(1b) D-ribose 5-phosphate + D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + NH3 
 
 
 
  pyridoxal 5'-phosphate + 4 H2O + phosphate


The enzyme can also use ribulose 5-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
