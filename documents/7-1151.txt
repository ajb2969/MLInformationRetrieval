   Great-circle navigation      Great-circle navigation   Great-circle navigation is the practice of navigating a vessel (a ship or aircraft ) along a great circle . A great circle track is the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere; the Earth isn't exactly spherical, but the formulas for a sphere are simpler and are often accurate enough for navigation (see the numerical example ).  Course and distance  The great circle path may be found using spherical trigonometry ; this is the spherical version of the inverse geodesic problem . If a navigator begins at P 1 = (φ 1 ,λ 1 ) and plans to travel the great circle to a point at point P 2 = (φ 2 ,λ 2 ) (see Fig. 1, φ is the latitude, positive northward, and λ is the longitude, positive eastward), the initial and final courses α 1 and α 2 are given by formulas for solving a spherical triangle      tan   α  1        subscript  α  1     \displaystyle\tan\alpha_{1}   where λ 12 = λ 2 − λ 1 1 and the quadrants of α 1 ,α 2 are determined by the signs of the numerator and denominator in the tangent formulas (e.g., using the atan2 function). The central angle between the two points, σ 12 , is given by        cos   σ  12    =     sin   ϕ  1     sin   ϕ  2     +    cos   ϕ  1     cos   ϕ  2     cos   λ  12       .         subscript  σ  12           subscript  ϕ  1       subscript  ϕ  2          subscript  ϕ  1       subscript  ϕ  2       subscript  λ  12        \cos\sigma_{12}=\sin\phi_{1}\sin\phi_{2}+\cos\phi_{1}\cos\phi_{2}\cos\lambda_{%
 12}.   {\sin\phi_1\sin\phi_2+\cos\phi_1\cos\phi_2\cos\lambda_{12}}. The numerator of this formula contains the quantities that were used to determine tanα 1 .}} The distance along the great circle will then be s 12 = R σ 12 , where R is the assumed radius of the earth and σ 12 is expressed in radians . Using the mean earth radius , R = R 1 , yields results for the distance s 12 which are within 1% of the geodesic distance for the WGS84 ellipsoid.  Finding way-points  To find the way-points , that is the positions of selected points on the great circle between P 1 and P 2 , we first extrapolate the great circle back to its node  A , the point at which the great circle crosses the equator in the northward direction: let the longitude of this point be λ 0 — see Fig 1. The azimuth at this point, α 0 , is given by the spherical sine rule:        sin   α  0    =    sin   α  1     cos   ϕ  1      .         subscript  α  0         subscript  α  1       subscript  ϕ  1       \sin\alpha_{0}=\sin\alpha_{1}\cos\phi_{1}.   .}} Let the angular distances along the great circle from A to P 1 and P 2 be σ 01 and σ 02 respectively. Then using Napier's rules we have        tan   σ  01    =    tan   ϕ  1     cos   α  1             subscript  σ  01         subscript  ϕ  1       subscript  α  1       \tan\sigma_{01}=\frac{\tan\phi_{1}}{\cos\alpha_{1}}\qquad   (If φ 1 = 0 and α 1 = ½π, use σ 01 = 0).  This gives σ 01 , whence σ 02 = σ 01 + σ 12 .  The longitude at the node is found from      tan   λ  01        subscript  λ  01     \displaystyle\tan\lambda_{01}   Finally, calculate the position and azimuth at an arbitrary point, P (see Fig. 2), by the spherical version of the direct geodesic problem .,\\ \tan\lambda_{12} &= \frac{\sin\sigma_{12}\sin\alpha_1} {\cos\phi_1\cos\sigma_{12} - \sin\phi_1\sin\sigma_{12}\cos\alpha_1},\\ \lambda_2 &= \lambda_1 + \lambda_{12},\\ \tan\alpha_2 &= \frac{\sin\alpha_1} {\cos\sigma_{12}\cos\alpha_1 - \tan\phi_1\sin\sigma_{12}}. \end{align}  The solution for way-points given in the main text is more general than this solution in that it allows way-points at specified longitudes to be found. In addition, the solution for σ (i.e., the position of the node) is needed when finding geodesics on an ellipsoid by means of the auxiliary sphere.}} Napier's rules give       \color   w  h  i  t  e  .  )  sin  ϕ  =  cos  α    0   sin  σ  ,     fragments  \color  w  h  i  t  e  normal-.  italic-  normal-)   ϕ    α   0    σ  normal-,    {\color{white}.\,\qquad)}\sin\phi=\cos\alpha_{0}\sin\sigma,   .}}      tan   (   λ  -   λ  0    )         λ   subscript  λ  0      \displaystyle\tan(\lambda-\lambda_{0})   The atan2 function should be used to determine σ 01 , λ, and α. For example, to find the midpoint of the path, substitute σ = ½(σ 01 + σ 02 ); alternatively to find the point a distance d from the starting point, take σ = σ 01 + d / R . Likewise, the vertex , the point on the great circle with greatest latitude, is found by substituting σ = +½π. It may be convenient to parameterize the route in terms of the longitude using        tan  ϕ   =    cot   α  0     sin   (   λ  -   λ  0    )      .        ϕ        subscript  α  0        λ   subscript  λ  0        \tan\phi=\cot\alpha_{0}\sin(\lambda-\lambda_{0}).   Latitudes at regular intervals of longitude can be found and the resulting positions transferred to the Mercator chart allowing the great circle to be approximated by a series of rhumb lines . The path determined in this way gives the great ellipse joining the end points, provided the coordinates    (  ϕ  ,  λ  )     ϕ  λ    (\phi,\lambda)   are interpreted as geographic coordinates on the ellipsoid.  These formulas apply to a spherical model of the earth. They are also used in solving for the great circle on the auxiliary sphere which is a device for finding the shortest path, or geodesic , on an ellipsoid of revolution; see the article on geodesics on an ellipsoid .  Example  Compute the great circle route from Valparaíso , φ 1 = −33°, λ 1 = −71.6°, to Shanghai , φ 2 = 31.4°, λ 2 = 121.8°.  The formulas for course and distance give λ 12 = −166.6°, α 1 = −94.41°, α 2 = −78.42°, and σ 12 = 168.56°. Taking the earth radius to be R = 6371 km, the distance is s 12 = 18743 km.  To compute points along the route, first find α 0 = −56.74°, σ 1 = −96.76°, σ 2 = 71.8°, λ 01 = 98.07°, and λ 0 = −169.67°. Then to compute the midpoint of the route (for example), take σ = ½(σ 1 + σ 2 ) = −12.48°, and solve for φ = −6.81°, λ = −159.18°, and α = −57.36°.  If the geodesic is computed accurately on the WGS84 ellipsoid, 2 the results are α 1 = −94.82°, α 2 = −78.29°, and s 12 = 18752 km. The midpoint of the geodesic is φ = −7.07°, λ = −159.31°, α = −57.45°.  Gnomonic chart  A straight line drawn on a Gnomonic chart would be a great circle track. When this is transferred to a Mercator chart, it becomes a curve. The positions are transferred at a convenient interval of longitude and this is plotted on the Mercator chart.
