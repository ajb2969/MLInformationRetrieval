   Hydroxyisourate hydrolase      Hydroxyisourate hydrolase   In enzymology , a hydroxyisourate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5-hydroxyisourate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-hydroxy-2-oxo-4-ureido-2,5-dihydro-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5-hydroxyisourate and H 2 O , whereas its product is 5-hydroxy-2-oxo-4-ureido-2,5-dihydro-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-hydroxyisourate amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include HIUHase , and 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
