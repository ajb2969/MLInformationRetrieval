In statistics, the q-Weibull distribution is a probability distribution that generalizes the Weibull distribution and the Lomax distribution (Pareto Type II). It is one example of a Tsallis distribution.
Characterization
Probability density function
The probability density function of a q-Weibull random variable is:1



where q \kappa > 0 are shape parameters and λ > 0 is the scale parameter of the distribution and



is the q-exponential234
Cumulative distribution function
The cumulative distribution function of a q-Weibull random variable is:


 
  where






Mean
The mean of the q-Weibull distribution is


 
  is the Beta function and 
 
 
 
  is the Gamma function. The expression for the mean is a continuous function of q over the range of definition for which it is finite.
Relationship to other distributions
The q-Weibull is equivalent to the Weibull distribution when q = 1 and equivalent to the q-exponential when 
 
 

The q-Weibull is a generalization of the Weibull, as it extends this distribution to the cases of finite support (q (q \ge 1+\frac{\kappa}{\kappa+1}).
The q-Weibull is a generalization of the Lomax distribution (Pareto Type II), as it extends this distribution to the cases of finite support and adds the 
 
 
 
  parameter. The Lomax parameters are:



As the Lomax distribution is a shifted version of the Pareto distribution, the q-Weibull for 
 
 
 
  is a shifted reparameterized generalization of the Pareto. When q > 1, the q-exponential is equivalent to the Pareto shifted to have support starting at zero. Specifically:
$$\text{If } X \sim \mathrm{qWeibull}(q,\lambda,\kappa = 1) \text{ and } Y \sim \left[\text{Pareto} 
 \left(
 x_m = {1 \over {\lambda (q-1)}}, \alpha = { {2-q} \over {q-1}} 
 \right) -x_m
 \right],
 \text{ then } X \sim Y \,$$
