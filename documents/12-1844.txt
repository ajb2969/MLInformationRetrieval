   Pseudo-abelian category      Pseudo-abelian category   In mathematics , specifically in category theory , a pseudo-abelian category is a category that is preadditive and is such that every idempotent has a kernel . 1 Recall that an idempotent morphism   p   p   p   is an endomorphism of an object with the property that     p  ∘  p   =  p        p  p   p    p\circ p=p   . Elementary considerations show that every idempotent then has a cokernel. 2 The pseudo-abelian condition is stronger than preadditivity, but it is weaker than the requirement that every morphism have a kernel and cokernel, as is true for abelian categories .  Synonyms in the literature for pseudo-abelian include pseudoabelian and Karoubian .  Examples  Any abelian category , in particular the category Ab of abelian groups , is pseudo-abelian. Indeed, in an abelian category, every morphism has a kernel.  The category of associative rngs (not rings !) together with multiplicative morphisms is pseudo-abelian.  A more complicated example is the category of Chow motives . The construction of Chow motives uses the pseudo-abelian completion described below.  Pseudo-abelian completion  The Karoubi envelope construction associates to an arbitrary category   C   C   C   a category    k  a  r   (  C  )       k  a  r  C    kar(C)   together with a functor      s  :   C  →   k  a  r   (  C  )        normal-:  s   normal-→  C    k  a  r  C      s:C\rightarrow kar(C)   such that the image    s   (  p  )       s  p    s(p)   of every idempotent   p   p   p   in   C   C   C   splits in    k  a  r   (  C  )       k  a  r  C    kar(C)   . When applied to a preadditive category    C   C   C   , the Karoubi envelope construction yields a pseudo-abelian category    k  a  r   (  C  )       k  a  r  C    kar(C)   called the pseudo-abelian completion of   C   C   C   . Moreover, the functor      C  →   k  a  r   (  C  )       normal-→  C    k  a  r  C     C\rightarrow kar(C)   is in fact an additive morphism.  To be precise, given a preadditive category   C   C   C   we construct a pseudo-abelian category    k  a  r   (  C  )       k  a  r  C    kar(C)   in the following way. The objects of    k  a  r   (  C  )       k  a  r  C    kar(C)   are pairs    (  X  ,  p  )     X  p    (X,p)   where   X   X   X   is an object of   C   C   C   and   p   p   p   is an idempotent of   X   X   X   . The morphisms      f  :    (  X  ,  p  )   →   (  Y  ,  q  )       normal-:  f   normal-→   X  p    Y  q      f:(X,p)\rightarrow(Y,q)   in    k  a  r   (  C  )       k  a  r  C    kar(C)   are those morphisms      f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\rightarrow Y   such that    f  =   q  ∘  f  ∘  p       f    q  f  p     f=q\circ f\circ p   in   C   C   C   . The functor      C  →   k  a  r   (  C  )       normal-→  C    k  a  r  C     C\rightarrow kar(C)   is given by taking   X   X   X   to    (  X  ,   i   d  X    )     X    i   subscript  d  X      (X,id_{X})   .
