   Fractional part      Fractional part   The fractional part of a non‐negative real number   x   x   x   is the excess beyond that number integer part      frac   (  x  )    =   x  -   ⌊  x  ⌋     ,   x  >  0      formulae-sequence     frac  x     x    x       x  0     \operatorname{frac}(x)=x-\lfloor x\rfloor,\;x>0   .  There are various conflicting ways to extend the fractional part function to negative numbers. It is either defined as     frac   (  x  )    =   x  -   ⌊  x  ⌋         frac  x     x    x      \operatorname{frac}(x)=x-\lfloor x\rfloor   , as the part of the number to the right of the radix point,     frac   (  x  )    =    |  x  |   -   ⌊   |  x  |   ⌋         frac  x       x       x       \operatorname{frac}(x)=|x|-\lfloor|x|\rfloor   , or as the odd function :       frac   (  x  )    =   {      x  -   ⌊  x  ⌋       x  ≥  0        x  -   ⌈  x  ⌉       x  <  0            frac  x    cases    x    x      x  0     x    x      x  0      \operatorname{frac}(x)=\begin{cases}x-\lfloor x\rfloor&x\geq 0\\
 x-\lceil x\rceil&x<0\end{cases}   For example, the number −1.3 has a fractional part of 0.7 according to the first definition, 0.3 according to the second definition and −0.3 according to the third definition.  For a positive number written in a conventional positional numeral system (such as binary or decimal ), the fractional part equals the digits appearing after the radix point . Equivalently, it equals the original number with the digits before the radix point substituted with 0.  Under the first definition all real numbers can be written in the form    n  +  r      n  r    n+r   where   n   n   n   is the number to the left of the radix point , and the remaining fractional part   r   r   r   is a nonnegative real number less than one. If   x   x   x   is a positive rational number , then the fractional part of   x   x   x   can be expressed in the form    p  /  q      p  q    p/q   , where   p   p   p   and   q   q   q   are integers and    0  ≤  p  <  q        0  p       q     0\leq p   . For example, if x = 1.05, then the fractional part of x is 0.05 and can be expressed as 5 / 100 = 1 / 20.
