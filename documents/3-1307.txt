Fractional part

The fractional part of a non‐negative real number 
 
 
 
  is the excess beyond that number integer part
 
 
 
 .
There are various conflicting ways to extend the fractional part function to negative numbers. It is either defined as 
 
 
 
  , as the part of the number to the right of the radix point, 
 
 
 
  , or as the odd function:


 
  For example, the number −1.3 has a fractional part of 0.7 according to the first definition, 0.3 according to the second definition and −0.3 according to the third definition.
For a positive number written in a conventional positional numeral system (such as binary or decimal), the fractional part equals the digits appearing after the radix point. Equivalently, it equals the original number with the digits before the radix point substituted with 0.
Under the first definition all real numbers can be written in the form 
 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the number to the left of the radix point, and the remaining fractional part 
 
 
 
  is a nonnegative real number less than one. If 
 
 
 
  is a positive rational number, then the fractional part of 
 
 
 
  can be expressed in the form 
 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are integers and 
 
 
 
 . For example, if x = 1.05, then the fractional part of x is 0.05 and can be expressed as 5 / 100 = 1 / 20.
