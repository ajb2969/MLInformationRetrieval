   Beta-L-arabinosidase      Beta-L-arabinosidase   In enzymology , a beta-L-arabinosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a beta-L-arabinoside + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-arabinose + an alcohol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are beta-L-arabinoside and H 2 O , whereas its two products are L-arabinose and alcohol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is beta-L-arabinoside arabinohydrolase . This enzyme is also called vicianosidase .
