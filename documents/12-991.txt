   Fundamental lemma of sieve theory      Fundamental lemma of sieve theory   In number theory , the fundamental lemma of sieve theory is any of several results that systematize the process of applying sieve methods to particular problems. Halberstam & Richert  1 write:  Diamond & Halberstam 2 attribute the terminology Fundamental Lemma to Jonas Kubilius .  Common notation  We use these notations:   A is a set of X positive integers, and A d is its subset of integers divisible by d  w ( d ) and R d are functions of A and of d that estimate the number of elements of A that are divisible by d , according to the formula         |   A  d   |   =      w   (  d  )    d   X   +   R  d     .         subscript  A  d            w  d   d   X    subscript  R  d      \left|A_{d}\right|=\frac{w(d)}{d}X+R_{d}.      Thus w ( d ) / d represents an approximate density of members divisible by d , and R d represents an error or remainder term.    P is a set of primes, and P ( z ) is the product of those primes ≤ z  S ( A , P , z ) is the number of elements of A not divisible by any prime in P that is ≤ z  κ is a constant, called the sifting density, 3 that appears in the assumptions below. It is a weighted average of the number of residue classes sieved out by each prime.   Fundamental lemma of the combinatorial sieve  This formulation is from Tenenbaum. 4 Other formulations are in Halberstam & Richert , 5 in Greaves, 6 and in Friedlander & Iwaniec . 7 We make the assumptions:   w ( d ) is a multiplicative function .  The sifting density κ satisfies, for some constant C and any real numbers η and ξ with 2 ≤ η ≤ ξ:          ∏   η  ≤  p  ≤  ξ      (   1  -    w   (  p  )    p    )    -  1     <     (    ln  ξ    ln  η    )   κ    (   1  +   C   ln  η     )     .        subscript  product      η  p       ξ      superscript    1      w  p   p      1        superscript      ξ     η    κ     1    C    η        \prod_{\eta\leq p\leq\xi}\left(1-\frac{w(p)}{p}\right)^{-1}<\left(\frac{\ln\xi%
 }{\ln\eta}\right)^{\kappa}\left(1+\frac{C}{\ln\eta}\right).     There is a parameter u ≥ 1 that is at our disposal. We have uniformly in A , X , z , and u that        S   (  a  ,  P  ,  z  )    =    X    ∏    p  ≤  z   ,   p  ∈  P       (   1  -    w   (  p  )    p    )    {   1  +   O   (   u   -   u  /  2     )     }      +   O   (    ∑   d  ≤   z  u   ,  d  |  P   (  z  )      |   R  d   |    )      .        S   a  P  z        X    subscript  product   formulae-sequence    p  z     p  P         1      w  p   p       1    O   superscript  u      u  2             O    subscript    fragments  d    superscript  z  u   normal-,  d  normal-|  P   fragments  normal-(  z  normal-)        subscript  R  d         S(a,P,z)=X\prod_{p\leq z,p\in P}\left(1-\frac{w(p)}{p}\right)\{1+O(u^{-u/2})\}%
 +O\left(\sum_{d\leq z^{u},d|P(z)}|R_{d}|\right).   In applications we pick u to get the best error term. In the sieve it represents the number of levels of the inclusion–exclusion principle .  Fundamental lemma of the Selberg sieve  This formulation is from Halberstam & Richert . 8 Another formulation is in Diamond & Halberstam . 9  We make the assumptions:   w ( d ) is a multiplicative function .  The sifting density κ satisfies, for some constant C and any real numbers η and ξ with 2 ≤ η ≤ ξ:          ∑   η  ≤  p  ≤  ξ      w   (  p  )    ln  p    p    <    κ   ln   ξ  η     +  C    .        subscript       η  p       ξ         w  p    p    p        κ      ξ  η     C     \sum_{\eta\leq p\leq\xi}\frac{w(p)\ln p}{p}<\kappa\ln\frac{\xi}{\eta}+C.      w ( p ) / p < 1 - c for some small fixed c and all p  | R d | ≤ ω( d ) where ω( d ) is the number of distinct prime divisors of d .   The fundamental lemma has almost the same form as for the combinatorial sieve. Write u = ln X / ln z . The conclusion is:        S   (  a  ,  P  ,  z  )    =   X    ∏    p  ≤  z   ,   p  ∈  P       (   1  -    w   (  p  )    p    )    {   1  +   O   (   e   -   u  /  2     )     }       .        S   a  P  z      X    subscript  product   formulae-sequence    p  z     p  P         1      w  p   p       1    O   superscript  e      u  2             S(a,P,z)=X\prod_{p\leq z,\ p\in P}\left(1-\frac{w(p)}{p}\right)\{1+O(e^{-u/2})\}.     Note that u is no longer an independent parameter at our disposal, but is controlled by the choice of z .  Note that the error term here is weaker than for the fundamental lemma of the combinatorial sieve. Halberstam & Richert remark: 10 "Thus it is not true to say, as has been asserted from time to time in the literature, that Selberg's sieve is always better than Brun's."
