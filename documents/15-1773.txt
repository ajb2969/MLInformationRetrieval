   Admittance (geophysics)      Admittance (geophysics)   In geophysics, admittance describes the small effects of atmospheric pressure on earth gravity. Studies have also been carried out regarding the gravity of Venus. 1 Admittance in geophysics takes atmospheric pressure as the input and measures small changes in the gravitational field as the output. Geophysics admittance is commonly measured in μGal/mbar. These units convert according to 1 Gal = 0.01 m/s 2 and 1 bar = 100 kPa, so in SI units the measurement would be in units of;       m  /   s  2    Pa        normal-m   superscript  normal-s  2    Pa    \frac{\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^{2}}{\mathrm{Pa}}   or     m  /   s  2     N  /   m  2          normal-m   superscript  normal-s  2      normal-N   superscript  normal-m  2      \frac{\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^{2}}{\mathrm{N}/\mathrm{m}^{2}}   or     m  3    N  ⋅   s  2         superscript  normal-m  3    normal-⋅  normal-N   superscript  normal-s  2      \frac{\mathrm{m}^{3}}{\mathrm{N}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{2}}   or, in primary units     m  2   kg       superscript  normal-m  2   kg    \frac{\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\mathrm{kg}}     However, the relationship is not a straightforward one of proportionality. Rather, an admittance function is described which is time and frequency dependent in a complex way. 2  References  "  Category:Geophysics     ↩  ↩
