Admittance (geophysics)

In geophysics, admittance describes the small effects of atmospheric pressure on earth gravity. Studies have also been carried out regarding the gravity of Venus.1 Admittance in geophysics takes atmospheric pressure as the input and measures small changes in the gravitational field as the output. Geophysics admittance is commonly measured in μGal/mbar. These units convert according to 1 Gal = 0.01 m/s2 and 1 bar = 100 kPa, so in SI units the measurement would be in units of;


 
    or   
 
 
 
    or   
 
 
 
    or, in primary units   
 
 

However, the relationship is not a straightforward one of proportionality. Rather, an admittance function is described which is time and frequency dependent in a complex way.2
