   Siegel Eisenstein series      Siegel Eisenstein series   In mathematics , a Siegel Eisenstein series (sometimes just called an Eisenstein series or a Siegel series ) is a generalization of Eisenstein series to Siegel modular forms .  gave an explicit formula for their coefficients.  Definition  The Siegel Eisenstein series of degree g and weight an even integer k > 2 is given by the sum       ∑   C  ,  D     1   det    (    C  Z   +  D   )   k         subscript    C  D      1     superscript      C  Z   D   k       \sum_{C,D}\frac{1}{\det(CZ+D)^{k}}   Sometimes the series is multiplied by a constant so that the constant term of the Fourier expansion is 1.  Here Z is an element of the Siegel upper half space of degree d , and the sum is over equivalence classes of matrices C , D that are the "bottom half" of an element of the Siegel modular group .
