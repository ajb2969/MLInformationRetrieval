Alpha-isocomene synthase




Alpha-isocomene synthase

Alpha-isocomene synthase (, MrTPS2) is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, (-)-alpha-isocomene-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (-)-alpha-isocomene + diphosphate


This enzyme is isolated from the roots of the plant Matricaria chamomilla var. recutita (chamomile).
