   5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase      5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase   In enzymology , a 5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin + coenzyme F 4 20   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin + reduced coenzyme F 4 20   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin and coenzyme F420 , whereas its two products are 5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin and reduced coenzyme F420.  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin:coenzyme-F420 oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase , N5,N10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase , methylene-H4MPT reductase , coenzyme F420-dependent N5,N10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin , reductase , and N5,N10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin:coenzyme-F420 oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in folate biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
