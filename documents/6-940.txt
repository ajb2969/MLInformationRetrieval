Book (graph theory)

 In graph theory, a book graph (often written 
 
 
 
  ) may be any of several kinds of graph.
One kind, which may be called a quadrilateral book, consists of p quadrilaterals sharing a common edge (known as the "spine" or "base" of the book).1 A book of this type is the Cartesian product of a star and K2 .
A second type, which might be called a triangular book, is the complete tripartite graph K1,1,p. It is a graph consisting of 
 
 
triangles sharing a common edge.2 A book of this type is a split graph. This graph has also been called a 
 
 
 
 .3
Given a graph 
 
 
 
 , one may write 
 
 
 
  for the largest book (of the kind being considered) contained within 
 
 
 
 .
The term "book-graph" has been employed for other uses. Barioli4 used it to mean a graph composed of a number of arbitrary subgraphs having two vertices in common. (Barioli did not write 
 
 
 
  for his book-graph.)
Theorems on books
Denote the Ramsey number of two (triangular) books by 
 
 


If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  (proved by Rousseau and Sheehan).


There exists a constant 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  whenever 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is large, the Ramsey number is given by 
 
 
 
 .


Let 
 
 
 
  be a constant, and 
 
 
 
 . Then every graph on 
 
 
 
  vertices and 
 
 
 
  edges contains a (triangular)
