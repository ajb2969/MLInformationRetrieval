   Book (graph theory)      Book (graph theory)   In graph theory , a book graph (often written    B  p     subscript  B  p    B_{p}   ) may be any of several kinds of graph.  One kind, which may be called a quadrilateral book , consists of p  quadrilaterals sharing a common edge (known as the "spine" or "base" of the book). 1 A book of this type is the Cartesian product of a star and K 2 .  A second type, which might be called a triangular book , is the complete tripartite graph K 1,1, p . It is a graph consisting of   p   p   p    triangles sharing a common edge. 2 A book of this type is a split graph . This graph has also been called a     K  e    (  2  ,  p  )        subscript  K  e    2  p     K_{e}(2,p)   . 3  Given a graph   G   G   G   , one may write    b  k   (  G  )       b  k  G    bk(G)   for the largest book (of the kind being considered) contained within   G   G   G   .  The term "book-graph" has been employed for other uses. Barioli 4 used it to mean a graph composed of a number of arbitrary subgraphs having two vertices in common. (Barioli did not write    B  p     subscript  B  p    B_{p}   for his book-graph.)  Theorems on books  Denote the Ramsey number of two (triangular) books by     r   (   B  p   ,   B  q   )    .      r    subscript  B  p    subscript  B  q      r(B_{p},\ B_{q}).      If    1  ≤  p  ≤  q        1  p       q     1\leq p\leq q   , then     r   (   B  p   ,   B  q   )    =    2  q   +  3         r    subscript  B  p    subscript  B  q         2  q   3     r(B_{p},\ B_{q})=2q+3   (proved by Rousseau and Sheehan ).    There exists a constant    c  =   o   (  1  )        c    o  1     c=o(1)   such that     r   (   B  p   ,   B  q   )    =    2  q   +  3         r    subscript  B  p    subscript  B  q         2  q   3     r(B_{p},\ B_{q})=2q+3   whenever    q  ≥   c  p       q    c  p     q\geq cp   .  If    p  ≤    q  /  6   +   o   (  q  )         p      q  6     o  q      p\leq q/6+o(q)   , and   q   q   q   is large, the Ramsey number is given by     2  q   +  3        2  q   3    2q+3   .    Let   C   C   C   be a constant, and    k  =   C  n       k    C  n     k=Cn   . Then every graph on   n   n   n   vertices and   m   m   m   edges contains a (triangular)    B  k     subscript  B  k    B_{k}   . 5   References  "  Category:Parametric families of graphs  Category:Planar graphs     Eric W.
