   23S rRNA (uridine2552-2'-O)-methyltransferase      23S rRNA (uridine2552-2'-O)-methyltransferase   23S rRNA (uridine 255 2-2'-O)-methyltransferase (, Um(2552) 23S ribosomal RNA methyltransferase , heat shock protein RrmJ , RrmJ , FTSJ , Um 2552 methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (uridine 2552 -2'-O-)-methyltransferase . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + uridine 2552 in 23S rRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methyluridine 2552 in 23S rRNA   The enzyme catalyses the 2'-O-methylation of the universally conserved U 2552 in the A loop of 23S rRNA .
