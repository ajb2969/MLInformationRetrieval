   Sulochrin oxidase ((+)-bisdechlorogeodin-forming)      Sulochrin oxidase ((+)-bisdechlorogeodin-forming)   In enzymology , a sulochrin oxidase [(+)-bisdechlorogeodin-forming] () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 sulochrin + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 (+)-bisdechlorogeodin + 2 H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sulochrin and O 2 , whereas its two products are (+)-bisdechlorogeodin and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on X-H and Y-H to form an X-Y bond with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sulochrin:oxygen oxidoreductase (cyclizing, (+)-specific) . This enzyme is also called sulochrin oxidase .
