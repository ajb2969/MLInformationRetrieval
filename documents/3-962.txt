   Primitive element theorem      Primitive element theorem   In field theory , the primitive element theorem or Artin's theorem on primitive elements is a result characterizing the finite degree field extensions that possess a primitive element , or simple extensions . It says that a finite extension is simple if and only if there are only finitely many intermediate fields. In particular, finite separable extensions are simple.  Terminology  Let    E  ⊇  F      F  E    E\supseteq F   be a finite field extension. An element    α  ∈  E      α  E    \alpha\in E   is said to be a primitive element for    E  ⊇  F      F  E    E\supseteq F   when       E  =   F   (  α  )     .      E    F  α     E=F(\alpha).     In this situation, the extension    E  ⊇  F      F  E    E\supseteq F   is referred to as a simple extension . Then every element x of E can be written in the form       x  =     f   n  -  1     α   n  -  1     +  ⋯  +    f  1   α   +   f  0     ,      x       subscript  f    n  1     superscript  α    n  1     normal-⋯     subscript  f  1   α    subscript  f  0      x=f_{n-1}{\alpha}^{n-1}+\cdots+f_{1}{\alpha}+f_{0},     where     f  i   ∈  F       subscript  f  i   F    f_{i}\in F   for all i , and    α  ∈  E      α  E    \alpha\in E   is fixed. That is, if    E  ⊇  F      F  E    E\supseteq F   is separable of degree n , there exists    α  ∈  E      α  E    \alpha\in E   such that the set      {  1  ,  α  ,  ⋯  ,   α   n  -  1    }     1  α  normal-⋯   superscript  α    n  1      \{1,\alpha,\cdots,{\alpha}^{n-1}\}     is a basis for E as a vector space over F .  For instance, the extensions     ℚ   (   2   )    ⊇  ℚ      ℚ    ℚ    2      \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\supseteq\mathbb{Q}   and     ℚ   (  x  )    ⊇  ℚ      ℚ    ℚ  x     \mathbb{Q}(x)\supseteq\mathbb{Q}   are simple extensions with primitive elements    2      2    \sqrt{2}   and x , respectively (    ℚ   (  x  )       ℚ  x    \mathbb{Q}(x)   denotes the field of rational functions in the indeterminate x over   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   ).  Existence statement  The interpretation of the theorem changed with the formulation of the theory of Emil Artin , around 1930. From the time of Galois, the role of primitive elements had been to represent a splitting field as generated by a single element. This (arbitrary) choice of such an element was bypassed in Artin's treatment. 1 At the same time, considerations of construction of such an element receded: the theorem becomes an existence theorem .  The following theorem of Artin then takes the place of the classical primitive element theorem .   Theorem   Let    E  ⊇  F      F  E    E\supseteq F   be a finite degree field extension. Then    E  =   F   (  α  )        E    F  α     E=F(\alpha)   for some element    α  ∈  E      α  E    \alpha\in E   if and only if there exist only finitely many intermediate fields K with    E  ⊇  K  ⊇  F       superset-of-or-equals  E  K    superset-of-or-equals    F     E\supseteq K\supseteq F   .  A corollary to the theorem is then the primitive element theorem in the more traditional sense (where separability was usually tacitly assumed):   Corollary   Let    E  ⊇  F      F  E    E\supseteq F   be a finite degree separable extension . Then    E  =   F   (  α  )        E    F  α     E=F(\alpha)   for some    α  ∈  E      α  E    \alpha\in E   .  The corollary applies to algebraic number fields , i.e. finite extensions of the rational numbers Q , since Q has characteristic 0 and therefore every extension over Q is separable.  Counterexamples  For non-separable extensions, necessarily in characteristic p with p a prime number, then at least when the degree [ L : K ] is p , L / K has a primitive element, because there are no intermediate subfields. When [ L : K ] = p 2 , there may not be a primitive element (and therefore there are infinitely many intermediate fields). This happens, for example if K is   F p ( T , U ),   the field of rational functions in two indeterminates T and U over the finite field with p elements, and L is obtained from K by adjoining a p -th root of T , and of U . In fact one can see that for any α in L , the element α p lies in K , but a primitive element must have degree p 2 over K .  Constructive results  Generally, the set of all primitive elements for a finite separable extension L / K is the complement of a finite collection of proper K -subspaces of L , namely the intermediate fields. This statement says nothing for the case of finite fields , for which there is a computational theory dedicated to finding a generator of the multiplicative group of the field (a cyclic group ), which is a fortiori a primitive element. Where K is infinite, a pigeonhole principle proof technique considers the linear subspace generated by two elements and proves that there are only finitely many linear combinations      γ  =   α  +   c  β        γ    α    c  β      \gamma=\alpha+c\beta     with c in K , that fail to generate the subfield containing both elements. This is almost immediate as a way of showing how Artin's result implies the classical result, and a bound for the number of exceptional c in terms of the number of intermediate fields results (this number being something that can be bounded itself by Galois theory and a priori ). Therefore in this case trial-and-error is a possible practical method to find primitive elements. See the Example.  Example  It is not, for example, immediately obvious that if one adjoins to the field   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   of rational numbers roots of both polynomials       x  2   -  2       superscript  x  2   2    x^{2}-2     and        x  2   -  3   ,       superscript  x  2   3    x^{2}-3,     say    2      2    \sqrt{2}   and    3      3    \sqrt{3}   respectively, to get a field K =    ℚ   (   2   ,   3   )       ℚ     2     3      \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})   of degree 4 over   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   , that the extension is simple and there exists a primitive element γ in K so that K =    ℚ   (  γ  )       ℚ  γ    \mathbb{Q}(\gamma)   . One can in fact check that with      γ  =    2   +   3        γ      2     3      \gamma=\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}     the powers γ  i for 0 ≤ i ≤ 3 can be written out as linear combinations of 1,    2      2    \sqrt{2}   ,    3      3    \sqrt{3}   , and      2    3    =   6           2     3      6     \sqrt{2}\sqrt{3}=\sqrt{6}   with integer coefficients. Taking these as a system of linear equations , or by factoring, one can solve for    2      2    \sqrt{2}   and    3      3    \sqrt{3}   over    ℚ   (  γ  )       ℚ  γ    \mathbb{Q}(\gamma)   (one gets, for instance,     2   =      γ  3   -   9  γ    2          2        superscript  γ  3     9  γ    2     \sqrt{2}=\scriptstyle\frac{\gamma^{3}-9\gamma}{2}   ), which implies that this choice of γ is indeed a primitive element in this example. A simpler argument, assuming the knowledge of all the subfields as given by Galois theory , is to note the independence of 1,    2      2    \sqrt{2}   ,    3      3    \sqrt{3}   , and     2    3         2     3     \sqrt{2}\sqrt{3}   over the rationals; this shows that the subfield generated by γ cannot be that generated by    2      2    \sqrt{2}   or    3      3    \sqrt{3}   or     2    3         2     3     \sqrt{2}\sqrt{3}   , exhausting all the subfields of degree 2. Therefore it must be the whole field.
