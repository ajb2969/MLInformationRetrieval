Gentisate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a gentisate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2,5-dihydroxybenzoate 
 
 
 
  hydroquinone + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate, and two products, hydroquinone and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase (hydroquinone-forming). Other names in common use include 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate decarboxylase, and gentisate carboxy-lyase. This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism.
