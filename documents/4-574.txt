This is a list of some vector calculus formulae for working with common curvilinear coordinate systems.
Notes

This article uses the standard notation ISO 80000-2, which supersedes ISO 31-11, for spherical coordinates (other sources may reverse the definitions of θ and ϕ):
 
The polar angle is denoted by θ: it is the angle between the z-axis and the radial vector connecting the origin to the point in question.
The azimuthal angle is denoted by ϕ: it is the angle between the x-axis and the projection of the radial vector onto the xy-plane.

The function  can be used instead of the mathematical function  owing to its  domain and  image. The classical arctan function has an image of , whereas atan2 is defined to have an image of .
