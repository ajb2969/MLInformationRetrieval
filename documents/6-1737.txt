   Cartan's criterion      Cartan's criterion   In mathematics , Cartan's criterion gives conditions for a Lie algebra in characteristic 0 to be solvable , which implies a related criterion for the Lie algebra to be semisimple . It is based on the notion of the Killing form , a symmetric bilinear form on   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   defined by the formula        K   (  u  ,  v  )    =   tr   (    ad   (  u  )     ad   (  v  )     )     ,        K   u  v     tr     ad  u    ad  v       K(u,v)=\operatorname{tr}(\operatorname{ad}(u)\operatorname{ad}(v)),   where tr denotes the trace of a linear operator . The criterion was introduced by . 1  Cartan's criterion for solvability  Cartan's criterion for solvability states:   A Lie subalgebra   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   of endomorphisms of a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic zero is solvable if and only if     T  r   (   a  b   )    =  0        T  r    a  b    0    Tr(ab)=0   whenever      a  ‚àà  ùî§   ,   b  ‚àà   [  ùî§  ,  ùî§  ]     .     formulae-sequence    a  ùî§     b   ùî§  ùî§      a\in\mathfrak{g},b\in[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}].       The fact that     T  r   (   a  b   )    =  0        T  r    a  b    0    Tr(ab)=0   in the solvable case follows immediately from Lie's theorem that solvable Lie algebras in characteristic 0 can be put in upper triangular form.  Applying Cartan's criterion to the adjoint representation gives:   A finite-dimensional Lie algebra   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   over a field of characteristic zero is solvable if and only if     K   (  ùî§  ,   [  ùî§  ,  ùî§  ]   )    =  0        K   ùî§   ùî§  ùî§     0    K(\mathfrak{g},[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}])=0   (where K is the Killing form).    Cartan's criterion for semisimplicity  Cartan's criterion for semisimplicity states:   A finite-dimensional Lie algebra   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   over a field of characteristic zero is semisimple if and only if the Killing form is non-degenerate .    gave a very short proof that if a finite-dimensional Lie algebra (in any characteristic) has a non-degenerate invariant bilinear form and no non-zero abelian ideals, and in particular if its Killing form is non-degenerate, then it is a sum of simple Lie algebras.  Conversely, it follows easily from Cartan's criterion for solvability that a semisimple algebra (in characteristic 0) has a non-degenerate Killing form.  Examples  Cartan's criteria fail in characteristic p >0; for example:   the Lie algebra SL p ( k ) is simple if k has characteristic not 2 and has vanishing Killing form, though it does have a nonzero invariant bilinear form given by ( a , b ) = Tr( ab ).  the Lie algebra with basis a n for n ‚àà Z / p Z and bracket [ a i , a j ] = ( i ‚àí j ) a i + j is simple for p >2 but has no nonzero invariant bilinear form.  If k has characteristic 2 then the semidirect product gl 2 ( k ). k 2 is a solvable Lie algebra, but the Killing form is not identically zero on its derived algebra sl 2 ( k ). k 2 .   If a finite-dimensional Lie algebra is nilpotent, then the Killing form is identically zero (and more generally the Killing form vanishes on any nilpotent ideal). The converse is false: there are non-nilpotent Lie algebras whose Killing form vanishes. An example is given by the semidirect product of an abelian Lie algebra V with a 1-dimensional Lie algebra acting on V as an endomorphism b such that b is not nilpotent and Tr( b 2 )=0.  In characteristic 0, every reductive Lie algebra (one that is a sum of abelian and simple Lie algebras) has a non-degenerate invariant symmetric bilinear form. However the converse is false: a Lie algebra with a non-degenerate invariant symmetric bilinear form need not be a sum of simple and abelian Lie algebras. A typical counterexample is G = L [ t ]/ t n L [ t ] where n >1, L is a simple complex Lie algebra with a bilinear form (,), and the bilinear form on G is given by taking the coefficient of t n ‚àí1 of the C [ t ]-valued bilinear form on G induced by the form on L . The bilinear form is non-degenerate, but the Lie algebra is not a sum of simple and abelian Lie algebras.
