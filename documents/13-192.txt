Graph equation

In graph theory,' Graph equations' are equations in which the unknowns are graphs. One of the central questions of graph theory concerns the notion of isomorphism. We ask: When are two graphs the same (i.e., graph isomorphism)? The graphs in question may be expressed differently in terms of graph equations.1
What are the graphs (solutions) G and H such that the line graph of G is same as the total graph of H? (What are G and H such that L(G) = '' T''( H) ? ).
For example, G = K3, and H = K2 are the solutions of the graph equation L(K3) = T(K2) and G = K4, and H = K3 are the solutions of the graph equation L(K4) = T(K3).

Note that T(K3) is a 4-regular graph on 6 vertices.
