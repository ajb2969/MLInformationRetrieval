   Graph equation      Graph equation   In graph theory , ' Graph equations ' are equations in which the unknowns are graphs . One of the central questions of graph theory concerns the notion of isomorphism . We ask: When are two graphs the same (i.e., graph isomorphism )? The graphs in question may be expressed differently in terms of graph equations. 1  What are the graphs ( solutions ) G and H such that the line graph of G is same as the total graph of H ? (What are G and H such that L ( G ) = '' T''( H ) ? ).  For example, G = K 3 , and H = K 2 are the solutions of the graph equation L ( K 3 ) = T ( K 2 ) and G = K 4 , and H = K 3 are the solutions of the graph equation L ( K 4 ) = T ( K 3 ).
