   Deoxycytidylate 5-hydroxymethyltransferase      Deoxycytidylate 5-hydroxymethyltransferase   In enzymology , a deoxycytidylate 5-hydroxymethyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate + H 2 O + deoxycytidylate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   tetrahydrofolate + 5-hydroxymethyldeoxycytidylate   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate , H 2 O , and deoxycytidylate , whereas its two products are tetrahydrofolate and 5-hydroxymethyldeoxycytidylate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases that transfer one-carbon groups, specifically the hydroxymethyl-, formyl- and related transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:deoxycytidylate 5-hydroxymethyltransferase . Other names in common use include dCMP hydroxymethylase , d-cytidine 5'-monophosphate hydroxymethylase , deoxyCMP hydroxymethylase , deoxycytidylate hydroxymethylase , and deoxycytidylic hydroxymethylase . This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism and one carbon pool by folate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
