Pentadecagon




Pentadecagon

In geometry, a pentadecagon (or pentakaidecagon) is any 15-sided, 15-angled, polygon.
A regular pentadecagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {15}.
Regular pentadecagon
A regular pentadecagon has interior angles of 156°, and with a side length a, has an area given by



Uses

 A regular triangle, decagon, and pentadecagon can completely fill a plane vertex.
Construction
A regular pentadecagon is constructible using compass and straightedge:

 Construction of a regular pentadecagon
Construction of a regular pentadecagon is Proposition XVI of Book IV of Euclid's Elements.1
Pentadecagrams
There are 3 regular star polygons: {15/2}, {15/4}, {15/7}, constructed from the same 15 vertices of a regular pentadecagon, but connected by skipping every second, fourth, or seventh vertex respectively.
There are also three regular star figures: {15/3}, {15/5}, {15/6}, the first being a compound of 3 pentagons, the second a compound of 5 equilateral triangles, and the third is a compound of 3 pentagrams.

Petrie polygons
The regular pentadecagon is the Petrie polygon for some higher-dimensional polytopes, projected in a skew orthogonal projection:





14-simplex (14D)



It is also the Petrie polygon for the great 120-cell and grand stellated 120-cell.
