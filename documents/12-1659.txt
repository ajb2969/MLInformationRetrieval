Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization

Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) is a pattern matching technique, common in machine learning applications. QUBO is an NP hard problem.
QUBO problems may sometimes be well-suited to algorithms aided by quantum annealing.1
QUBO is given by the formula: $E(X_1, X_2, ... , X_N) = \sum_{i
