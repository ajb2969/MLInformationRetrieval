   Ekeland's variational principle      Ekeland's variational principle   In mathematical analysis , Ekeland's variational principle , discovered by Ivar Ekeland , 1 2 3 is a theorem that asserts that there exists nearly optimal solutions to some optimization problems .  Ekeland's variational principle can be used when the lower level set of a minimization problems is not compact , so that the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem can not be applied. Ekeland's principle relies on the completeness of the metric space . 4  Ekeland's principle leads to a quick proof of the Caristi fixed point theorem . 5 6  Ekeland's principle has been shown by F. Sullivan to be equivalent to completeness of metric spaces.  Ekeland was associated with the Paris Dauphine University when he proposed this theorem. 7  Statement of the theorem  Let ( X , d ) be a complete metric space , and let F : X → R ∪ {+∞} be a lower semicontinuous functional on X that is bounded below and not identically equal to +∞. Fix ε > 0 and a point u ∈ X such that        F   (  u  )    ≤   ε  +    inf   x  ∈  X     F   (  x  )       .        F  u     ε    subscript  infimum    x  X      F  x       F(u)\leq\varepsilon+\inf_{x\in X}F(x).   Then there exists a point v ∈ X such that        F   (  v  )    ≤   F   (  u  )     ,        F  v     F  u     F(v)\leq F(u),           d   (  u  ,  v  )    ≤  1   ,        d   u  v    1    d(u,v)\leq 1,   and, for all w ≠ v ,        F   (  w  )    >    F   (  v  )    -   ε  d   (  v  ,  w  )      .        F  w       F  v     ε  d   v  w       F(w)>F(v)-\varepsilon d(v,w).     This theorem has been shown by F. Sullivan to be equivalent to completeness for metric spaces.
