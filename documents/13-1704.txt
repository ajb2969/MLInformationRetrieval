   Parikh's theorem      Parikh's theorem  '''Parikh's theorem''' in [[theoretical computer science]] says that if one looks only at the relative number of occurrences of [[Context-free grammar#Formal definitions|terminal symbols]] in a [[context-free language]], without regard to their order, then the language is indistinguishable from a [[regular langua ge]]. 1 It is useful for deciding whether or not a string with a given number of some terminals is accepted by a context-free grammar. 2 It was first proved by Rohit Parikh in 1961 3 and republished in 1966. 4  Definitions and formal statement  Let    Σ  =   {   a  1   ,   a  2   ,  …  ,   a  k   }       normal-Σ    subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-…   subscript  a  k      \Sigma=\{a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{k}\}   be an alphabet . The Parikh vector of a word is defined as the function    p  :    Σ  *   →   ℕ  k       normal-:  p   normal-→   superscript  normal-Σ     superscript  ℕ  k      p:\Sigma^{*}\to\mathbb{N}^{k}   , given by 5      p   (  w  )    =   (    |  w  |    a  1    ,    |  w  |    a  2    ,  …  ,    |  w  |    a  k    )         p  w     subscript    w    subscript  a  1     subscript    w    subscript  a  2    normal-…   subscript    w    subscript  a  k       p(w)=(|w|_{a_{1}},|w|_{a_{2}},\ldots,|w|_{a_{k}})   , where     |  w  |    a  i      subscript    w    subscript  a  i     |w|_{a_{i}}   denotes the number of occurrences of the letter    a  i     subscript  a  i    a_{i}   in the word   w   w   w   .  A subset of    ℕ  k     superscript  ℕ  k    \mathbb{N}^{k}   is said to be linear if it is of the form        u  0   +   ⟨   u  1   ,  …  ,   u  m   ⟩    =   {    u  0   +    t  1    u  1    +  …  +    t  m    u  m     ∣     t  1   ,  …  ,   t  m    ∈  ℕ   }          subscript  u  0     subscript  u  1   normal-…   subscript  u  m      conditional-set     subscript  u  0      subscript  t  1    subscript  u  1    normal-…     subscript  t  m    subscript  u  m         subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  m    ℕ      u_{0}+\langle u_{1},\ldots,u_{m}\rangle=\{u_{0}+t_{1}u_{1}+\ldots+t_{m}u_{m}%
 \mid t_{1},\ldots,t_{m}\in\mathbb{N}\}   for some vectors     u  0   ,  …  ,   u  m       subscript  u  0   normal-…   subscript  u  m     u_{0},\ldots,u_{m}   .  A subset of    ℕ  k     superscript  ℕ  k    \mathbb{N}^{k}   is said to be semi-linear if it is a union of finitely many linear subsets.  The formal statement of Parikh's theorem is as follows. Let   L   L   L   be a context-free language. Let    P   (  L  )       P  L    P(L)   be the set of Parikh vectors of words in   L   L   L   , that is,     P   (  L  )    =   {   p   (  w  )    ∣   w  ∈  L   }         P  L    conditional-set    p  w     w  L      P(L)=\{p(w)\mid w\in L\}   . Then    P   (  L  )       P  L    P(L)   is a semi-linear set.  If   S   S   S   is any semi-linear set, the language of words whose Parikh vectors are in   S   S   S   is a regular language. Thus, if one considers two languages to be commutatively equivalent if they have the same set of Parikh vectors, then every context-free language is commutatively equivalent to some regular language.  Significance  Parikh's theorem proves that some context-free languages can only have ambiguous grammars . Such languages are called inherently ambiguous languages . From a formal grammar perspective, this means that some ambiguous context-free grammars cannot be converted to equivalent unambiguous context-free grammars.
