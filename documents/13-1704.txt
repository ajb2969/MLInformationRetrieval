Parikh's theorem
'''Parikh's theorem''' in [[theoretical computer science]] says that if one looks only at the relative number of occurrences of [[Context-free grammar#Formal definitions|terminal symbols]] in a [[context-free language]], without regard to their order, then the language is indistinguishable from a [[regular langua
 ge]].1 It is useful for deciding whether or not a string with a given number of some terminals is accepted by a context-free grammar.2 It was first proved by Rohit Parikh in 19613 and republished in 1966.4
Definitions and formal statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be an alphabet. The Parikh vector of a word is defined as the function 
 
 
 
 , given by5

 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the number of occurrences of the letter 
 
 
 
  in the word 
 
 
 
 .
A subset of 
 
 
 
  is said to be linear if it is of the form


 
  for some vectors 
 
 
 
 .
A subset of 
 
 
 
  is said to be semi-linear if it is a union of finitely many linear subsets.
The formal statement of Parikh's theorem is as follows. Let 
 
 
 
  be a context-free language. Let 
 
 
 
  be the set of Parikh vectors of words in 
 
 
 
 , that is, 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is a semi-linear set.
If 
 
 
 
  is any semi-linear set, the language of words whose Parikh vectors are in 
 
 
 
  is a regular language. Thus, if one considers two languages to be commutatively equivalent if they have the same set of Parikh vectors, then every context-free language is commutatively equivalent to some regular language.
Significance
Parikh's theorem proves that some context-free languages can only have ambiguous grammars. Such languages are called inherently ambiguous languages. From a formal grammar perspective, this means that some ambiguous context-free grammars cannot be converted to equivalent unambiguous context-free grammars.
