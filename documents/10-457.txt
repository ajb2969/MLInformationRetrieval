   Ephedrine dehydrogenase      Ephedrine dehydrogenase   In enzymology , an ephedrine dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (-)-ephedrine + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (R)-2-methylimino-1-phenylpropan-1-ol + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (-)-ephedrine and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are (R)-2-methylimino-1-phenylpropan-1-ol , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (-)-ephedrine:NAD+ 2-oxidoreductase .  References     "  Category:EC 1.5.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
