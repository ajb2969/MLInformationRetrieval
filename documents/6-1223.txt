   Trochoid      Trochoid   thumb|290px|right|A cycloid (a common trochoid ) generated by a rolling circle  A trochoid (from the Greek word for wheel, "trochos") is the curve described by a fixed point on a circle as it rolls along a straight line. 1 The cycloid is a notable member of the trochoid family. The word "trochoid" was coined by Gilles de Roberval .  Basic description  As a circle of radius a rolls without slipping along a line L, the center C moves parallel to L, and every other point P in the rotating plane rigidly attached to the circle traces the curve called the trochoid. Let CP = b . Parametric equations of the trochoid for which L is the x-axis are      x  =    a  θ   -   b   sin   (  θ  )          x      a  θ     b    θ       x=a\theta-b\sin(\theta)\,         y  =   a  -   b   cos   (  θ  )          y    a    b    θ       y=a-b\cos(\theta)\,   where θ is the variable angle through which the circle rolls.  Curtate, common, prolate  If P lies inside the circle ( b  a ), the trochoid is described as being curtate ("contracted"), common, or prolate ("extended"), respectively. 2 A curtate trochoid is traced by a pedal when a bicycle is pedaled along a straight line. A prolate trochoid is traced by the tip of a paddle when a boat is driven with constant velocity by paddle wheels; this curve contains loops. A common trochoid, also called a cycloid , has cusps at the points where P touches the L .  General description  A more general approach would define a trochoid as the locus of a point    (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,y)    orbiting at a constant rate around an axis located at    (   x  ′   ,   y  ′   )      superscript  x  normal-′    superscript  y  normal-′     (x^{\prime},y^{\prime})   ,        x  =    x  ′   +    r  1    cos   (     ω  1   t   +   ϕ  1    )       ,    y  =    y  ′   +    r  1    sin   (     ω  1   t   +   ϕ  1    )       ,    r  1   >  0     ,     formulae-sequence    x     superscript  x  normal-′      subscript  r  1          subscript  ω  1   t    subscript  ϕ  1         formulae-sequence    y     superscript  y  normal-′      subscript  r  1          subscript  ω  1   t    subscript  ϕ  1           subscript  r  1   0      x=x^{\prime}+r_{1}\cos(\omega_{1}t+\phi_{1}),\ y=y^{\prime}+r_{1}\sin(\omega_{%

 \end{array}     The ratio of the rates of motion and whether the moving axis translates in a straight or circular path determines the shape of the trochoid. In the case of a straight path, one full rotation coincides with one period of a periodic (repeating) locus. In the case of a circular path for the moving axis, the locus is periodic only if the ratio of these angular motions,     ω  1   /   ω  2        subscript  ω  1    subscript  ω  2     \omega_{1}/\omega_{2}   , is a rational number, say    p  /  q      p  q    p/q   , where   p   p   p   &   q   q   q   are coprime , in which case, one period consists of   p   p   p   orbits around the moving axis and   q   q   q   orbits of the moving axis around the point    (   x  0   ,   y  0   )      subscript  x  0    subscript  y  0     (x_{0},y_{0})   .
