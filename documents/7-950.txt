Correlation sum

In chaos theory, the correlation sum is the estimator of the correlation integral, which reflects the mean probability that the states at two different times are close:



where 
 
 
 
  is the number of considered states 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a threshold distance, 
 
 
 
  a norm (e.g. Euclidean norm) and 
 
 
 
  the Heaviside step function. If only a time series is available, the phase space can be reconstructed by using a time delay embedding (see Takens' theorem):



where 
 
 
 
  is the time series, 
 
 
 
  the embedding dimension and 
 
 
 
  the time delay.
The correlation sum is used to estimate the correlation dimension.
