<h1>Dotted note</h1>
<hr/>
<p>{| align=right | |} </p>
<p>In Western <a href="musical_notation" title="wikilink">musical notation</a>, a <strong>dotted note</strong> is a <a href="Musical_note" title="wikilink">note</a> with a small dot written after it. In modern practice the first dot increases the <a href="duration_(music)" title="wikilink">duration</a> of the basic note by half of its original value. A dotted note is equivalent to writing the basic note <a href="tie_(music)" title="wikilink">tied</a> to a note of half the value; or with more than one dot, tied to notes of progressively halved value.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The length of any given note <em>a</em> with <em>n</em> dots is therefore given by the <a href="geometric_series" title="wikilink">geometric series</a> <span class="LaTeX">$a_n=a\left(1+\tfrac 12+\tfrac 14+ \cdots + \tfrac 1{2^n}\right)=a(2-\frac 1{2^n})$</span>. More than three dots are highly uncommon but theoretically possible;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> only quadruple dots have been attested.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>A rhythm using longer notes alternating with shorter notes (whether notated with dots or not) is sometimes called a <strong>dotted rhythm</strong>. Historical examples of music performance styles using dotted rhythm include <a href="notes_inégales" title="wikilink">notes inégales</a> and <a href="swing_(jazz_performance_style)" title="wikilink">swing</a>. The precise performance of dotted rhythms can be a complex issue. Even in notation that includes dots, their performed values may be longer than the dot mathematically indicates, a practice known as <strong>over-dotting</strong>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="notation">Notation</h2>
<p> If the note to be dotted is on a space, the dot also goes on the space, while if the note is on a line, the dot goes on the space above (this also goes for notes on ledger lines).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> However, if a dotted note on a line is part of a <a href="chord_(music)" title="wikilink">chord</a> where a higher note is also on a line, the dot for the lower note is placed in the space below:  <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The dots on dotted notes, which are located to the right of the note, are not to be confused with the dots which indicate <a class="uri" href="staccato" title="wikilink">staccato</a> <a href="articulation_(music)" title="wikilink">articulation</a>, which are located above or below the note as shown in the 3rd and 4th notes of Example 2.</p>
<p>Theoretically, any note value can be dotted, as can <a href="rest_(music)" title="wikilink">rests</a> of any value. If the rest is in its normal position, dots are always placed in third staff space from the bottom.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The use of a dot for <a href="Augmentation_(music)" title="wikilink">augmentation</a> of a note dates back at least to the 10th century, although the exact amount of augmentation is disputed; see <a class="uri" href="Neume" title="wikilink">Neume</a>.</p>
<p>Dots can be used across <a href="bar_(music)" title="wikilink">barlines</a>, such as in <a href="H._C._Robbins_Landon" title="wikilink">H. C. Robbins Landon</a>'s edition of Joseph Haydn's <a href="Symphony_No._70_(Haydn)" title="wikilink">Symphony No. 70 in D major</a>, but most writers today regard this usage as obsolete and recommend using a tie across the barline instead.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>More than one dot may be added; each dot adds half of the duration added by the previous dot, as shown in example 1.</p>
<h2 id="double-dotting">Double dotting</h2>
<p>A double-dotted note is a note with two small dots written after it. Its duration is 1¾ times its basic <a href="note_value" title="wikilink">note value</a>.</p>
<p>The double-dotted note is used less frequently than the dotted note. Typically, as in the example below, it is followed by a note whose duration is one-quarter the length of the basic note value, completing the next higher note value.</p>
<p>Before the mid 18th century, double dots were not used. Until then, in some circumstances, single dots could mean double dots.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p> Example 2 is a fragment of the second movement of <a href="Joseph_Haydn" title="wikilink">Joseph Haydn</a>'s <a href="string_quartet" title="wikilink">string quartet</a>, <a href="Opus_number" title="wikilink">Op.</a> 74, No. 2, a <a href="variation_(music)" title="wikilink">theme and variations</a>. The first note is double-dotted. Haydn's theme was adapted for piano by an unknown composer; the adapted version can be heard  (3.7 <a href="Kilobyte" title="wikilink">KB</a> <a class="uri" href="MIDI" title="wikilink">MIDI</a> file).</p>
<p>In a <a href="French_overture" title="wikilink">French overture</a> (and sometimes other <a href="Baroque_music" title="wikilink">Baroque music</a>), notes written as dotted notes are often interpreted to mean double-dotted notes,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and the following note is commensurately shortened; see <a href="Historically_informed_performance" title="wikilink">Historically informed performance</a>.</p>
<h2 id="triple-dotting">Triple dotting</h2>
<p> A triple-dotted note is a note with three dots written after it; its duration is 1<span class="LaTeX">${7}/{8}$</span> times its basic note value. Use of a triple-dotted note value is not common in the Baroque and Classical periods, but quite common in the music of <a href="Richard_Wagner" title="wikilink">Richard Wagner</a> and <a href="Anton_Bruckner" title="wikilink">Anton Bruckner</a>, especially in their brass parts. See example 3.</p>
<p>An example of the use of double- and triple-dotted notes is the Prelude in G major for piano, <a href="Preludes_(Chopin)" title="wikilink">Op. 28</a>, No. 3, by <a href="Frédéric_Chopin" title="wikilink">Frédéric Chopin</a>. The piece, in <a href="time_signature" title="wikilink">common time</a> (4/4), contains running <a href="Sixteenth_note" title="wikilink">semiquavers</a> (American English: sixteenth note) in the left hand. Several times during the piece Chopin asks for the right hand to play a triple-dotted <a href="half_note" title="wikilink">minim</a> (American English: half note) (lasting 15 semiquavers) simultaneously with the first left-hand semiquaver, then one semiquaver simultaneously with the 16th left-hand semiquaver.</p>
