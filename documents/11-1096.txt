   Kynurenine—oxoglutarate transaminase      Kynurenine—oxoglutarate transaminase   In enzymology , a kynurenine-oxoglutarate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-kynurenine + 2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-(2-aminophenyl)-2,4-dioxobutanoate + L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-kynurenine and 2-oxoglutarate , whereas its two products are 4-(2-aminophenyl)-2,4-dioxobutanoate and L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , to be specific, the transaminases , that transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-kynurenine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include kynurenine transaminase (cyclizing) , kynurenine 2-oxoglutarate transaminase , kynurenine aminotransferase , and L-kynurenine aminotransferase . This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  Structural studies  As of early 2009, 18 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
