   Feedback with Carry Shift Registers      Feedback with Carry Shift Registers  In sequence design, a '''Feedback with Carry Shift Register''' (or FCSR) is the  arithmetic or with carry analog of a [[Linear feedback shift register]] (LFSR).  If N >1 is an integer, then an N-ary FCSR of length r is a finite state device with a state (a;z)  = (a_0,a_1,\dots,a_{r-1};z) consisting of a vector of elements a_i in \{0,1,\dots,N-1\}=S and an integer z .

Couture and P. L’Ecuyer, ''On the lattice structure of certain linear congruential sequences related to AWC/SWB generators, Math. Comp. vol. 62, pp. 799–808'', 1994, 1 , 1 2 The state change operation is determined by a set of coefficients     q  1   ,  …  ,   q  n       subscript  q  1   normal-…   subscript  q  n     q_{1},\dots,q_{n}   and is defined as follows: compute    s  =     q  r    a  0    +    q   r  -  1     a  1    +  …  +    q  1    a   r  -  1     +  z       s       subscript  q  r    subscript  a  0       subscript  q    r  1     subscript  a  1    normal-…     subscript  q  1    subscript  a    r  1     z     s=q_{r}a_{0}+q_{r-1}a_{1}+\dots+q_{1}a_{r-1}+z   . Express s as    s  =    a  r   +   N   z  ′         s     subscript  a  r     N   superscript  z  normal-′       s=a_{r}+Nz^{\prime}   with    a  r     subscript  a  r    a_{r}   in   S   S   S   . Then the new state is    (   a  1   ,   a  2   ,  …  ,   a  r   ;   z  ′   )      subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-…   subscript  a  r    superscript  z  normal-′     (a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{r};z^{\prime})   . By iterating the state change an FCSR generates an infinite, eventually period sequence of numbers in   S   S   S   .  FCSRs have been used in the design of stream ciphers (such as the F-FCSR generator), in the cryptanalyis of the summation combiner stream cipher (the reason Goresky and Klapper invented them 3 ), and in generating pseudorandom numbers for quasi-Monte Carlo (under the name Multiply With Carry (MWC) generator - invented by Couture and L'Ecuyer, 4 ) generalizing work of Marsaglia and Zaman. 5  FCSRs are analyzed using number theory . Associated with the FCSR is a connection integer    q  =      q  r    N  r    +  …  +    q  1    N  1     -  1       q         subscript  q  r    superscript  N  r    normal-…     subscript  q  1    superscript  N  1     1     q=q_{r}N^{r}+\dots+q_{1}N^{1}-1   . Associated with the output sequence is the N-adic number     a  =    a  0   +    a  1   N   +    a  2    N  2    +  …       a     subscript  a  0      subscript  a  1   N      subscript  a  2    superscript  N  2    normal-…     a=a_{0}+a_{1}N+a_{2}N^{2}+\dots   The fundamental theorem of FCSRs says that there is an integer   u   u   u   so that    a  =   u  /  q       a    u  q     a=u/q   , a rational number. The output sequence is strictly periodic if and only if   u   u   u   is between    -  q      q    -q   and   0   0    . It is possible to express u as a simple quadratic polynomial involving the initial state and the q i . 6  There is also an exponential representation of FCSRs: if   g   g   g   is the inverse of    N  mod  q     modulo  N  q    N\mod q   , and the output sequence is strictly periodic, then     a  i   =    (    A   g  i    mod  q   )   mod  N        subscript  a  i    modulo   modulo    A   subscript  g  i    q   N     a_{i}=(Ag_{i}\mod q)\mod N   , where   A   A   A   is an integer. It follows that the period is at most the order of N in the multiplicative group of units modulo q. This is maximized when q is prime and N is a primitive element modulo q. In this case, the period is    q  -  1      q  1    q-1   . In this case the output sequence is called an l-sequence (for "long sequence"). 7  l-sequences have many excellent statistical properties 8 9 that make them candidates for use in applications, 10 including near uniform distribution of sub-blocks, ideal arithmetic autocorrelations, and the arithmetic shift and add property. They are the with-carry analog of m-sequences or maximum length sequences .  There are efficient algorithms for FCSR synthesis. This is the problem: given a prefix of a sequence, construct a minimal length FCSR that outputs the sequence. This can be solved with a variant of Mahler 11 and De Weger's 12 lattice based analysis of N-adic numbers when    N  =  2      N  2    N=2   ; 13 by a variant of the Euclidean algorithm when N is prime; and in general by Xu's adaptation of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. 14 If L is the size of the smallest FCSR that outputs the sequence (called the N-adic complexity of the sequence), then all these algorithms require a prefix of length about    2  L      2  L    2L   to be successful and have quadratic time complexity. It follows that, as with LFSRs and linear complexity, any stream cipher whose N-adic complexity is low should not be used for cryptography.  FCSRs and LFSRs are special cases of a very general algebraic construction of sequence generators called Algebraic Feedback Shift Registers (AFSRs) in which the integers are replaced by an arbitrary ring R and N is replaced by an arbitrary non-unit in R. 15 A general reference on the subject of LFSRs, FCSRs, and AFSRs is the book. 16  References    "  Category:Stream ciphers  Category:Cryptography  Category:Digital registers  Category:Cryptographic algorithms  Category:Pseudorandom number generators     M.
