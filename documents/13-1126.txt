Feedback with Carry Shift Registers
In sequence design, a '''Feedback with Carry Shift Register''' (or FCSR) is the  arithmetic or with carry analog of a [[Linear feedback shift register]] (LFSR).  If  is an integer, then an N-ary FCSR of length  is a finite state device with a state  consisting of a vector of elements  in  and an integer .A. Klapper and M. Goresky, ''Feedback Shift Registers, 2-Adic Span, and Combiners With Memory, in Journal of Cryptology vol. 10, pp. 111-147'', 1997, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/bnxf4xc81ltqdlfm/?p=d309beafbf334b32b24164de4503446aπ=3]R. Couture and P. L’Ecuyer, ''On the lattice structure of certain linear congruential sequences related to AWC/SWB generators, Math. Comp. vol. 62, 
 pp. 799–808'', 1994, 1,12 The state change operation is determined by a set of coefficients 
 
 
 
  and is defined as follows: compute 
 
 
 
 . Express s as 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . Then the new state is 
 
 
 
 . By iterating the state change an FCSR generates an infinite, eventually period sequence of numbers in 
 
 
 
 .
FCSRs have been used in the design of stream ciphers (such as the F-FCSR generator), in the cryptanalyis of the summation combiner stream cipher (the reason Goresky and Klapper invented them3), and in generating pseudorandom numbers for quasi-Monte Carlo (under the name Multiply With Carry (MWC) generator - invented by Couture and L'Ecuyer,4) generalizing work of Marsaglia and Zaman.5
FCSRs are analyzed using number theory. Associated with the FCSR is a connection integer 
 
 
 
 . Associated with the output sequence is the N-adic number

 
  The fundamental theorem of FCSRs says that there is an integer 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
 , a rational number. The output sequence is strictly periodic if and only if 
 
 
 
  is between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . It is possible to express u as a simple quadratic polynomial involving the initial state and the qi.6
There is also an exponential representation of FCSRs: if 
 
 
 
  is the inverse of 
 
 
 
 , and the output sequence is strictly periodic, then 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is an integer. It follows that the period is at most the order of N in the multiplicative group of units modulo q. This is maximized when q is prime and N is a primitive element modulo q. In this case, the period is 
 
 
 
 . In this case the output sequence is called an l-sequence (for "long sequence").7
l-sequences have many excellent statistical properties89 that make them candidates for use in applications,10 including near uniform distribution of sub-blocks, ideal arithmetic autocorrelations, and the arithmetic shift and add property. They are the with-carry analog of m-sequences or maximum length sequences.
There are efficient algorithms for FCSR synthesis. This is the problem: given a prefix of a sequence, construct a minimal length FCSR that outputs the sequence. This can be solved with a variant of Mahler11 and De Weger's12 lattice based analysis of N-adic numbers when 
 
 
 
 ;13 by a variant of the Euclidean algorithm when N is prime; and in general by Xu's adaptation of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm.14 If L is the size of the smallest FCSR that outputs the sequence (called the N-adic complexity of the sequence), then all these algorithms require a prefix of length about 
 
 
 
  to be successful and have quadratic time complexity. It follows that, as with LFSRs and linear complexity, any stream cipher whose N-adic complexity is low should not be used for cryptography.
FCSRs and LFSRs are special cases of a very general algebraic construction of sequence generators called Algebraic Feedback Shift Registers (AFSRs) in which the integers are replaced by an arbitrary ring R and N is replaced by an arbitrary non-unit in R.15 A general reference on the subject of LFSRs, FCSRs, and AFSRs is the book.16
