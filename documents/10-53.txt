   Banach–Stone theorem      Banach–Stone theorem   In mathematics , the Banach–Stone theorem is a classical result in the theory of continuous functions on topological spaces , named after the mathematicians  Stefan Banach and Marshall Stone .  In brief, the Banach–Stone theorem allows one to recover a compact Hausdorff space from the algebra of scalars (the bounded continuous functions on the space). In modern language, this is the commutative case of the spectrum of a C*-algebra , and the Banach–Stone theorem can be seen as a functional analysis analog of the connection between a ring R and the spectrum of a ring Spec( R ) in algebraic geometry .  Statement of the theorem  For a topological space X , let C b ( X ; R ) denote the normed vector space of continuous, real-valued , bounded functions  f : X → R equipped with the supremum norm ||·|| ∞ . This is an algebra, called the algebra of scalars , under pointwise multiplication of functions. For a compact space  X , C b ( X ; R ) is the same as C ( X ; R ), the space of all continuous functions f : X → R . The algebra of scalars is a functional analysis analog of the ring of regular functions in algebraic geometry, there denoted    𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   .  Let X and Y be compact , Hausdorff spaces and let T : C ( X ; R ) → C ( Y ; R ) be a surjective  linear isometry . Then there exists a homeomorphism  φ : Y → X and g ∈ C ( Y ; R ) with       |   g   (  y  )    |   =   1  for all  y   ∈  Y            g  y      1  for all  y        Y     |g(y)|=1\mbox{ for all }y\in Y     and          (   T  f   )    (  y  )    =   g   (  y  )   f   (   φ   (  y  )    )   for all  y   ∈  Y   ,   f  ∈   C   (  X  ;  𝐑  )      .     formulae-sequence          T  f   y     g  y  f    φ  y   for all  y        Y      f    C   X  𝐑       (Tf)(y)=g(y)f(\varphi(y))\mbox{ for all }y\in Y,f\in C(X;\mathbf{R}).     Generalizations  The Banach–Stone theorem has some generalizations for vector-valued continuous functions on compact, Hausdorff topological spaces. For example, if E is a Banach space with trivial centralizer and X and Y are compact, then every linear isometry of C ( X ; E ) onto C ( Y ; E ) is a strong Banach–Stone map .  More significantly, the Banach–Stone theorem suggests the philosophy that one can replace a space (a geometric notion) by an algebra , with no loss. Reversing this, it suggests that one can consider algebraic objects, even if they do not come from a geometric object, as a kind of "algebra of scalars". In this vein, any commutative  C*-algebra is the algebra of scalars on a Hausdorff space. Thus one may consider non commutative C*-algebras (and their Spec) as non-commutative spaces. This is the basis of the field of noncommutative geometry .  References     "  Category:Continuous mappings  Category:Operator theory  Category:Theorems in functional analysis
