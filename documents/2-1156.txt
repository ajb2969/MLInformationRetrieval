Linnik's theorem

Linnik's theorem in analytic number theory answers a natural question after Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. It asserts that there exist positive c and L such that, if we denote p(a,d) the least prime in the arithmetic progression



where n runs through the positive integers and a and d are any given positive coprime integers with 1 ≤ a ≤ d - 1, then:



The theorem is named after Yuri Vladimirovich Linnik, who proved it in 1944.12 Although Linnik's proof showed c and L to be effectively computable, he provided no numerical values for them.
Properties
It is known that L ≤ 2 for almost all integers d.3
On the generalized Riemann hypothesis it can be shown that



where 
 
 
 
  is the totient function.4
It is also conjectured that:

Bounds for L
The constant L is called Linnik's constant 6 and the following table shows the progress that has been made on determining its size.

Moreover, in Heath-Brown's result the constant c is effectively computable.
