   Linnik's theorem      Linnik's theorem   Linnik's theorem in analytic number theory answers a natural question after Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions . It asserts that there exist positive c and L such that, if we denote p ( a , d ) the least prime in the arithmetic progression       a  +   n  d    ,      a    n  d     a+nd,     where n runs through the positive integers and a and d are any given positive coprime integers with 1 ≤ a ≤ d - 1, then:        p   (  a  ,  d  )    <   c   d  L     .        p   a  d      c   superscript  d  L      p(a,d)     The theorem is named after Yuri Vladimirovich Linnik , who proved it in 1944. 1 2 Although Linnik's proof showed c and L to be effectively computable , he provided no numerical values for them.  Properties  It is known that L ≤ 2 for almost all integers d . 3  On the generalized Riemann hypothesis it can be shown that        p   (  a  ,  d  )    ≤    (   1  +   o   (  1  )     )   φ    (  d  )   2     ln  2    d      ,        p   a  d        1    o  1    φ   superscript  d  2     superscript   2   d      p(a,d)\leq(1+o(1))\varphi(d)^{2}\ln^{2}d\;,     where   φ   φ   \varphi   is the totient function . 4  It is also conjectured that:        p   (  a  ,  d  )    <   d  2    .        p   a  d     superscript  d  2     p(a,d)    5  Bounds for L  The constant L is called Linnik's constant  6 and the following table shows the progress that has been made on determining its size.
