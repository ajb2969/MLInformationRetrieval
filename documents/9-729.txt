   Bicarbonate buffering system      Bicarbonate buffering system   The bicarbonate buffering system is an important buffer system in the acid-base homeostasis of living things, including humans. As a buffer, it tends to maintain a relatively constant plasma  pH and counteract any force that would alter. In this system, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) combines with water (H 2 O) to form carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3 ), which in turn rapidly dissociates to form hydrogen ions (H + ) and bicarbonate (HCO 3 − ) as shown in the reactions below.        CO  2   +    H  2   O    ⇄    H  2    CO  3    ⇄    HCO  3  -   +   H  +         normal-⇄     subscript  CO  2      subscript  normal-H  2   normal-O       subscript  normal-H  2    subscript  CO  3      normal-⇄       superscript   subscript  HCO  3      superscript  normal-H        \rm CO_{2}+H_{2}O\rightleftarrows H_{2}CO_{3}\rightleftarrows HCO_{3}^{-}+H^{+}     The carbon dioxide - carbonic acid equilibrium is catalyzed by the enzyme  carbonic anhydrase ; the carbonic acid - bicarbonate equilibrium is simple proton dissociation/association and needs no catalyst.  Any disturbance of the system will be compensated by a shift in the chemical equilibrium according to Le Chatelier's principle . For example, if one attempted to acidify the blood by dumping in an excess of hydrogen ions ( acidemia ), some of those hydrogen ions will associate with bicarbonate, forming carbonic acid, resulting in a smaller net increase of acidity than otherwise. This buffering system becomes an even more powerful regulator of acidity when it is coupled with the body's capacity for respiratory compensation , in which breathing is altered to modify the amount of CO 2 in circulation. In the above example, increased ventilation would increase the loss of CO 2 to the atmosphere, driving the equilibria above to the left. The process could continue until the excess acid is all exhaled .  This process is extremely important in the physiology of blood-having animals. It manages the many acid and base imbalances that can be produced by both normal and abnormal physiology . It also affects the handling of carbon dioxide, the constantly produced waste product of cellular respiration .  Henderson–Hasselbalch equation  A modified version of the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation can be used to relate the pH of blood to constituents of the bicarbonate buffering system: 1       p  H   =    p   K    a    H  2   C   O  3      +   log   (    [   H  C   O  3  -    ]    [    H  2   C   O  3    ]    )           p  H       p   subscript  K    a   subscript  H  2   C   subscript  O  3           delimited-[]    H  C   superscript   subscript  O  3        delimited-[]     subscript  H  2   C   subscript  O  3          pH=pK_{a~{}H_{2}CO_{3}}+\log\left(\frac{[HCO_{3}^{-}]}{[H_{2}CO_{3}]}\right)     , where:   pK a H 2 CO 3 is the negative logarithm (base 10) of the acid dissociation constant of carbonic acid . It is equal to 6.1.  [HCO 3 − ] is the concentration of bicarbonate in the blood  [H 2 CO 3 ] is the concentration of carbonic acid in the blood   This is useful in arterial blood gas , but these usually state pCO 2 , that is, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide , rather than H 2 CO 3 . However, these are related by the equation: 2       [    H  2   C   O  3    ]   =      k    H    CO  2      ×  p   C   O  2         delimited-[]     subscript  H  2   C   subscript  O  3          subscript  k    normal-H   subscript  CO  2     p   C   subscript  O  2      [H_{2}CO_{3}]=k_{\rm H~{}CO_{2}}\,\times pCO_{2}   , where:   [H 2 CO 3 ] is the concentration of carbonic acid in the blood  k H CO 2 is a constant including the solubility of carbon dioxide in blood. k H CO 2 is approximately 0.03 ( mmol / L )/ mmHg  pCO 2 is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood   Taken together, the following equation can be used to relate the pH of blood to the concentration of bicarbonate and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide: 3       p  H   =   6.1  +   log   (    [   H  C   O  3  -    ]     0.03  ×  p   C   O  2     )           p  H     6.1       delimited-[]    H  C   superscript   subscript  O  3           0.03  p   C   subscript  O  2         pH=6.1+\log\left(\frac{[HCO_{3}^{-}]}{0.03\times pCO_{2}}\right)   , where:   pH is the acidity in the blood  [HCO 3 − ] is the concentration of bicarbonate in the blood, in mmol / L  pCO 2 is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood, in mmHg   References  External links     "  Category:Electrolyte disturbances  Category:Buffers     [ http://books.google.com.my/books?id=qyHu0Iu-XOUC&pg; ;=PA556 page 556], section "Estimating plasma pH" in: ↩
