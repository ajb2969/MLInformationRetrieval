Transmissibility (structural dynamics)

Transmissibility, in the context of Structural Dynamics, can be defined as the ratio of the maximum force (
 
 
 
 ) on the floor as a result of the vibration of a machine to the maximum machine force (
 
 
 
 ):




Where 
 
 
 
  is equal to the damping ratio and 
 
 
 
  is equal to the frequency ratio. 
 
 
 
  is the ratio of the dynamic to static amplitude.
