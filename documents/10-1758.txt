   Transmissibility (structural dynamics)      Transmissibility (structural dynamics)   Transmissibility , in the context of Structural Dynamics , can be defined as the ratio of the maximum force (    f   m  a  x      subscript  f    m  a  x     f_{max}   ) on the floor as a result of the vibration of a machine to the maximum machine force (    P  0     subscript  P  0    P_{0}   ):       T  R   =    f   m  a  x     P  0    =    R  d     1  +    (   2  ζ  β   )   2              T  R      subscript  f    m  a  x     subscript  P  0            subscript  R  d       1   superscript    2  ζ  β   2         TR=\frac{f_{max}}{P_{0}}=R_{d}\sqrt{1+(2\zeta\beta)^{2}}      Where   ζ   ζ   \zeta   is equal to the damping ratio and   β   β   \beta   is equal to the frequency ratio.    R  d     subscript  R  d    R_{d}   is the ratio of the dynamic to static amplitude.
