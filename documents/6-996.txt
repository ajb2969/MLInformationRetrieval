Le Cam's theorem

In probability theory, Le Cam's theorem, named after Lucien le Cam (1924 – 2000), states the following.
Suppose:

X1, ..., Xn are independent random variables, each with a Bernoulli distribution (i.e., equal to either 0 or 1), not necessarily identically distributed.


Pr(Xi = 1) = pi for i = 1, 2, 3, ...









 
  (i.e. 
 
 
 
  follows a Poisson binomial distribution)

Then



In other words, the sum has approximately a Poisson distribution and the above inequality bounds the approximation error in terms of the total variation distance.
By setting pi = λn/n, we see that this generalizes the usual Poisson limit theorem.
