   De Rham–Weil theorem      De Rham–Weil theorem   In algebraic topology , the De Rham–Weil theorem allows computation of sheaf cohomology using an acyclic  resolution of the sheaf in question.  Let   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   be a sheaf on a topological space    X   X   X   and    ℱ  ∙     superscript  ℱ  normal-∙    \mathcal{F}^{\bullet}   a resolution of   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   by acyclic sheaves. Then         H  q    (  X  ,  ℱ  )    ≅    H  q    (    ℱ  ∙    (  X  )    )     ,         superscript  H  q    X  ℱ       superscript  H  q      superscript  ℱ  normal-∙   X      H^{q}(X,\mathcal{F})\cong H^{q}(\mathcal{F}^{\bullet}(X)),     where     H  q    (  X  ,  ℱ  )        superscript  H  q    X  ℱ     H^{q}(X,\mathcal{F})   denotes the   q   q   q   -th sheaf cohomology  group of   X   X   X   with coefficients in    ℱ  .    ℱ   \mathcal{F}.     The De Rham–Weil theorem follows from the more general fact that derived functors may be computed using acyclic resolutions instead of simply injective resolutions.
