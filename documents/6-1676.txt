De Rham–Weil theorem

In algebraic topology, the De Rham–Weil theorem allows computation of sheaf cohomology using an acyclic resolution of the sheaf in question.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a sheaf on a topological space

 
  and 
 
 
 
  a resolution of 
 
 
 
  by acyclic sheaves. Then



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the 
 
 
 
 -th sheaf cohomology group of 
 
 
 
  with coefficients in 
 
 

The De Rham–Weil theorem follows from the more general fact that derived functors may be computed using acyclic resolutions instead of simply injective resolutions.
