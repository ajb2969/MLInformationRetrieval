2-aminoadipate transaminase

In enzymology, a 2-aminoadipate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-2-aminoadipate + 2-oxoglutarate 
 
 
 
  2-oxoadipate + L-glutamate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-2-aminoadipate and 2-oxoglutarate, whereas its two products are 2-oxoadipate and L-glutamate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-2-aminoadipate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase. Other names in common use include alpha-aminoadipate aminotransferase, 2-aminoadipate aminotransferase, 2-aminoadipic aminotransferase, glutamic-ketoadipic transaminase, and glutamate-alpha-ketoadipate transaminase. This enzyme participates in lysine biosynthesis and lysine degradation. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
Structural studies
