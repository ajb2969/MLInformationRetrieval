   Icosahedral symmetry      Icosahedral symmetry   A regular icosahedron has 60 rotational (or orientation-preserving) symmetries, and a symmetry order of 120 including transformations that combine a reflection and a rotation. A regular dodecahedron has the same set of symmetries, since it is the dual of the icosahedron.  The set of orientation-preserving symmetries forms a group referred to as A 5 (the alternating group on 5 letters), and the full symmetry group (including reflections) is the product A 5 × Z 2 . The latter group is also known as the Coxeter group  H 3 , and is also represented by Coxeter notation , [5,3] and Coxeter diagram .  As point group  Apart from the two infinite series of prismatic and antiprismatic symmetry, rotational icosahedral symmetry or chiral icosahedral symmetry of chiral objects and full icosahedral symmetry or achiral icosahedral symmetry are the discrete point symmetries (or equivalently, symmetries on the sphere ) with the largest symmetry groups .  Icosahedral symmetry is not compatible with translational symmetry , so there are no associated crystallographic point groups or space groups .      Schö.   Coxeter   Orb.

The group I is isomorphic to A 5 , the alternating group of even permutations of five objects. This isomorphism can be realized by I acting on various compounds, notably the compound of five cubes (which inscribe in the dodecahedron ), the compound of five octahedra , or either of the two compounds of five tetrahedra (which are enantiomorphs , and inscribe in the dodecahedron).  The group contains 5 versions of T h with 20 versions of D 3 (10 axes, 2 per axis), and 6 versions of D 5 .  The  I h has order 120. It has I as normal subgroup of index 2. The group I h is isomorphic to I × Z 2 , or A 5 × Z 2 , with the inversion in the center corresponding to element (identity,-1), where Z 2 is written multiplicatively.  I h acts on the compound of five cubes and the compound of five octahedra , but −1 acts as the identity (as cubes and octahedra are centrally symmetric). It acts on the compound of ten tetrahedra : I acts on the two chiral halves ( compounds of five tetrahedra ), and −1 interchanges the two halves. Notably, it does not act as S 5 , and these groups are not isomorphic; see below for details.  The group contains 10 versions of D 3d and 6 versions of D 5d (symmetries like antiprisms).  I is also isomorphic to PSL 2 (5), but I h is not isomorphic to SL 2 (5).  Commonly confused groups  The following groups all have order 120, but are not isomorphic:   S 5 , the symmetric group on 5 elements  I h , the full icosahedral group (subject of this article, also known as H 3 )  2 I , the binary icosahedral group   They correspond to the following short exact sequences (which do not split) and product      1  →   A  5   →   S  5   →   Z  2   →  1       normal-→  1   subscript  A  5     normal-→     subscript  S  5     normal-→     subscript  Z  2     normal-→    1     1\to A_{5}\to S_{5}\to Z_{2}\to 1          I  h   =    A  5   ×   Z  2         subscript  I  h      subscript  A  5    subscript  Z  2      I_{h}=A_{5}\times Z_{2}         1  →   Z  2   →   2  I   →   A  5   →  1       normal-→  1   subscript  Z  2     normal-→      2  I     normal-→     subscript  A  5     normal-→    1     1\to Z_{2}\to 2I\to A_{5}\to 1   In words,       A  5     subscript  A  5    A_{5}   is a normal subgroup of    S  5     subscript  S  5    S_{5}         A  5     subscript  A  5    A_{5}   is a factor of    I  h     subscript  I  h    I_{h}   , which is a direct product      A  5     subscript  A  5    A_{5}   is a quotient group of    2  I      2  I    2I      Note that    A  5     subscript  A  5    A_{5}   has an exceptional irreducible 3-dimensional representation (as the icosahedral rotation group), but    S  5     subscript  S  5    S_{5}   does not have an irreducible 3-dimensional representation, corresponding to the full icosahedral group not being the symmetric group.  These can also be related to linear groups over the finite field with five elements, which exhibit the subgroups and covering groups directly; none of these are the full icosahedral group:         A  5   ≅   PSL   (  2  ,  5  )     ,       subscript  A  5    PSL  2  5     A_{5}\cong\operatorname{PSL}(2,5),   the projective special linear group , see here for a proof;        S  5   ≅   PGL   (  2  ,  5  )     ,       subscript  S  5    PGL  2  5     S_{5}\cong\operatorname{PGL}(2,5),   the projective general linear group ;        2  I   ≅   SL   (  2  ,  5  )     ,        2  I    SL  2  5     2I\cong\operatorname{SL}(2,5),   the special linear group .

Kleinert and K. Maki 2 and its structure was first analyzed in detail in that paper. See the review article here . In aluminum, the icosahedral structure was discovered experimentally three years after this by Dan Shechtman , which earned him the Nobel Prize in 2011.  Related geometries  Icosahedral symmetry is equivalently the projective special linear group PSL(2,5), and is the symmetry group of the modular curve X(5), and more generally PSL(2, p ) is the symmetry group of the modular curve X( p ). The modular curve X(5) is geometrically a dodecahedron with a cusp at the center of each polygonal face, which demonstrates the symmetry group.  This geometry, and associated symmetry group, was studied by Felix Klein as the monodromy groups of a Belyi surface – a Riemann surface with a holomorphic map to the Riemann sphere, ramified only at 0, 1, and infinity (a Belyi function ) – the cusps are the points lying over infinity, while the vertices and the centers of each edge lie over 0 and 1; the degree of the covering (number of sheets) equals 5.  This arose from his efforts to give a geometric setting for why icosahedral symmetry arose in the solution of the quintic equation , with the theory given in the famous ; a modern exposition is given in .  Klein's investigations continued with his discovery of order 7 and order 11 symmetries in  and  (and associated coverings of degree 7 and 11) and dessins d'enfants , the first yielding the Klein quartic , whose associated geometry has a tiling by 24 heptagons (with a cusp at the center of each).  Similar geometries occur for PSL(2, n ) and more general groups for other modular curves.  More exotically, there are special connections between the groups PSL(2,5) (order 60), PSL(2,7) (order 168) and PSL(2,11) (order 660), which also admit geometric interpretations – PSL(2,5) is the symmetries of the icosahedron (genus 0), PSL(2,7) of the Klein quartic (genus 3), and PSL(2,11) the buckyball surface (genus 70). These groups form a " trinity " in the sense of Vladimir Arnold , which gives a framework for the various relationships; see trinities for details.  There is a close relationship to other Platonic solids .  See also   tetrahedral symmetry  octahedral symmetry  binary icosahedral group  Icosian calculus   References       Peter R.
