Icosahedral symmetry




Icosahedral symmetry

  A regular icosahedron has 60 rotational (or orientation-preserving) symmetries, and a symmetry order of 120 including transformations that combine a reflection and a rotation. A regular dodecahedron has the same set of symmetries, since it is the dual of the icosahedron.
The set of orientation-preserving symmetries forms a group referred to as A5 (the alternating group on 5 letters), and the full symmetry group (including reflections) is the product A5 × Z2. The latter group is also known as the Coxeter group H3, and is also represented by Coxeter notation, [5,3] and Coxeter diagram .
As point group
Apart from the two infinite series of prismatic and antiprismatic symmetry, rotational icosahedral symmetry or chiral icosahedral symmetry of chiral objects and full icosahedral symmetry or achiral icosahedral symmetry are the discrete point symmetries (or equivalently, symmetries on the sphere) with the largest symmetry groups.
Icosahedral symmetry is not compatible with translational symmetry, so there are no associated crystallographic point groups or space groups.

Group structure
 The  I is of order 60. The group I is isomorphic to A5, the alternating group of even permutations of five objects. This isomorphism can be realized by I acting on various compounds, notably the compound of five cubes (which inscribe in the dodecahedron), the compound of five octahedra, or either of the two compounds of five tetrahedra (which are enantiomorphs, and inscribe in the dodecahedron).
The group contains 5 versions of Th with 20 versions of D3 (10 axes, 2 per axis), and 6 versions of D5.
The  Ih has order 120. It has I as normal subgroup of index 2. The group Ih is isomorphic to I × Z2, or A5 × Z2, with the inversion in the center corresponding to element (identity,-1), where Z2 is written multiplicatively.
Ih acts on the compound of five cubes and the compound of five octahedra, but −1 acts as the identity (as cubes and octahedra are centrally symmetric). It acts on the compound of ten tetrahedra: I acts on the two chiral halves (compounds of five tetrahedra), and −1 interchanges the two halves. Notably, it does not act as S5, and these groups are not isomorphic; see below for details.
The group contains 10 versions of D3d and 6 versions of D5d (symmetries like antiprisms).
I is also isomorphic to PSL2(5), but Ih is not isomorphic to SL2(5).
Commonly confused groups
The following groups all have order 120, but are not isomorphic:

S5, the symmetric group on 5 elements
Ih, the full icosahedral group (subject of this article, also known as H3)
2I, the binary icosahedral group

They correspond to the following short exact sequences (which do not split) and product

All of these classes of subgroups are conjugate (i.e., all vertex stabilizers are conjugate), and admit geometric interpretations.
Note that the stabilizer of a vertex/edge/face/polyhedron and its opposite are equal, since 
 
 
 
  is central.
Vertex stabilizers
Stabilizers of an opposite pair of vertices can be interpreted as stabilizers of the axis they generate.

vertex stabilizers in I give cyclic groups C3
vertex stabilizers in Ih give dihedral groups D3
stabilizers of an opposite pair of vertices in I give dihedral groups D3
stabilizers of an opposite pair of vertices in Ih give 
 
 


Edge stabilizers
Stabilizers of an opposite pair of edges can be interpreted as stabilizers of the rectangle they generate.

edges stabilizers in I give cyclic groups Z2
edges stabilizers in Ih give Klein four-groups


stabilizers of a pair of edges in I give Klein four-groups

 
 ; there are 5 of these, given by rotation by 180° in 3 perpendicular axes.

Face stabilizers
Stabilizers of an opposite pair of faces can be interpreted as stabilizers of the anti-prism they generate.

face stabilizers in I give cyclic groups C5
face stabilizers in Ih give dihedral groups D5
stabilizers of an opposite pair of faces in I give dihedral groups D5
stabilizers of an opposite pair of faces in Ih give 
 
 


Polyhedron stabilizers
For each of these, there are 5 conjugate copies, and the conjugation action gives a map, indeed an isomorphism, 
 
 
 
 .

stabilizers of the inscribed tetrahedra in I are a copy of T
stabilizers of the inscribed tetrahedra in Ih are a copy of Th
stabilizers of the inscribed cubes (or opposite pair of tetrahedra, or octahedrons) in I are a copy of O
stabilizers of the inscribed cubes (or opposite pair of tetrahedra, or octahedrons) in Ih are a copy of Oh

 Faces of disdyakis triacontahedron are the fundamental domain



In the disdyakis triacontahedron one full face is a fundamental domain; other solids with the same symmetry can be obtained by adjusting the orientation of the faces, e.g. flattening selected subsets of faces to combine each subset into one face, or replacing each face by multiple faces, or a curved surface.

Liquid crystals with icosahedral symmetry
For the intermediate material phase called liquid crystals the existence of icosahedral symmetry was proposed by H. Kleinert and K. Maki2 and its structure was first analyzed in detail in that paper. See the review article here. In aluminum, the icosahedral structure was discovered experimentally three years after this by Dan Shechtman, which earned him the Nobel Prize in 2011.
Related geometries
Icosahedral symmetry is equivalently the projective special linear group PSL(2,5), and is the symmetry group of the modular curve X(5), and more generally PSL(2,p) is the symmetry group of the modular curve X(p). The modular curve X(5) is geometrically a dodecahedron with a cusp at the center of each polygonal face, which demonstrates the symmetry group.
This geometry, and associated symmetry group, was studied by Felix Klein as the monodromy groups of a Belyi surface – a Riemann surface with a holomorphic map to the Riemann sphere, ramified only at 0, 1, and infinity (a Belyi function) – the cusps are the points lying over infinity, while the vertices and the centers of each edge lie over 0 and 1; the degree of the covering (number of sheets) equals 5.
This arose from his efforts to give a geometric setting for why icosahedral symmetry arose in the solution of the quintic equation, with the theory given in the famous ; a modern exposition is given in .
Klein's investigations continued with his discovery of order 7 and order 11 symmetries in  and  (and associated coverings of degree 7 and 11) and dessins d'enfants, the first yielding the Klein quartic, whose associated geometry has a tiling by 24 heptagons (with a cusp at the center of each).
Similar geometries occur for PSL(2,n) and more general groups for other modular curves.
More exotically, there are special connections between the groups PSL(2,5) (order 60), PSL(2,7) (order 168) and PSL(2,11) (order 660), which also admit geometric interpretations – PSL(2,5) is the symmetries of the icosahedron (genus 0), PSL(2,7) of the Klein quartic (genus 3), and PSL(2,11) the buckyball surface (genus 70). These groups form a "trinity" in the sense of Vladimir Arnold, which gives a framework for the various relationships; see trinities for details.
There is a close relationship to other Platonic solids.
