   Aryl-aldehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+)      Aryl-aldehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+)   In enzymology , an aryl-aldehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an aromatic aldehyde + NADP + + AMP + diphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   an aromatic acid + NADPH + H + + ATP   The 5 substrates of this enzyme are aromatic aldehyde , NADP + , AMP , diphosphate , and H 2 O , whereas its 4 products are aromatic acid , NADPH , H + , and ATP .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aryl-aldehyde:NADP+ oxidoreductase (ATP-forming) . Other names in common use include aromatic acid reductase , and aryl-aldehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+) .
