Rational zeta series

In mathematics, a rational zeta series is the representation of an arbitrary real number in terms of a series consisting of rational numbers and the Riemann zeta function or the Hurwitz zeta function. Specifically, given a real number x, the rational zeta series for x is given by



where qn is a rational number, the value m is held fixed, and ζ(s, m) is the Hurwitz zeta function. It is not hard to show that any real number x can be expanded in this way.
Elementary series
For integer m>1, one has



For m=2, a number of interesting numbers have a simple expression as rational zeta series:



and



where γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. The series



follows by summing the Gauss–Kuzmin distribution. There are also series for π:



and



being notable because of its fast convergence. This last series follows from the general identity



which in turn follows from the generating function for the Bernoulli numbers



Adamchik and Srivastava give a similar series



Polygamma-related series
A number of additional relationships can be derived from the Taylor series for the polygamma function at z = 1, which is


 
 . The above converges for |z| \sum_{n=2}^\infty t^n \left[\zeta(n)-1\right] = -t\left[\gamma +\psi(1-t) -\frac{t}{1-t}\right] 
which holds for |t| (m) is the polygamma function. Many series involving the binomial coefficient may be derived:



where ν is a complex number. The above follows from the series expansion for the Hurwitz zeta


 
  taken at y = −1. Similar series may be obtained by simple algebra:



and



and



and



For integer n ≥ 0, the series



can be written as the finite sum



The above follows from the simple recursion relation Sn + Sn + 1 = ζ(n + 2). Next, the series



may be written as



for integer n ≥ 1. The above follows from the identity Tn + Tn + 1 = Sn. This process may be applied recursively to obtain finite series for general expressions of the form



for positive integers m.
Half-integer power series
Similar series may be obtained by exploring the Hurwitz zeta function at half-integer values. Thus, for example, one has



Expressions in the form of p-series
Adamchik and Srivastava give



and



where 
 
 
 
  are the Bernoulli numbers and 
 
 
 
  are the Stirling numbers of the second kind.
