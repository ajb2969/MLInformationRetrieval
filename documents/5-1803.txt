Renewal theory

Renewal theory is the branch of probability theory that generalizes Poisson processes for arbitrary holding times. Applications include calculating the best strategy for replacing worn-out machinery in a factory and comparing the long-term benefits of different insurance policies.
Renewal processes
Introduction
A renewal process is a generalization of the Poisson process. In essence, the Poisson process is a continuous-time Markov process on the positive integers (usually starting at zero) which has independent identically distributed holding times at each integer 
 
 
 
  (exponentially distributed) before advancing (with probability 1) to the next integer
 
 
 
 . In the same informal spirit, we may define a renewal process to be the same thing, except that the holding times take on a more general distribution. (Note however that the independence and identical distribution (IID) property of the holding times is retained).
Formal definition

Let 
 
 
 
  be a sequence of positive independent identically distributed random variables such that



We refer to the random variable 
 
 
 
  as the "
 
 
 
 th" holding time. 
 
 
 
  is the expectation of 
 
 
 
 .
Define for each n > 0 :



each 
 
 
 
  referred to as the "
 
 
 
 th" jump time and the intervals



being called renewal intervals.
Then the random variable 
 
 
 
  given by



(where 
 
 
 
  is the indicator function) represents the number of jumps that have occurred by time t, and is called a renewal process.
Interpretation
If one considers events occurring at random times, one may choose to think of the holding times

 
  as the random time elapsed between two subsequent events. For example, if the renewal process is modelling the breakdown of different machines, then the holding times represent the time between one machine breaking down before another one does.
Renewal-reward processes

Let 
 
 
 
  be a sequence of IID random variables (rewards) satisfying



Then the random variable



is called a renewal-reward process. Note that unlike the 
 
 
 
 , each 
 
 
 
  may take negative values as well as positive values.
The random variable 
 
 
 
  depends on two sequences: the holding times 
 
 
 
  and the rewards 
 
 
 
  These two sequences need not be independent. In particular, 
 
 
 
  may be a function of 
 
 
 
 .
Interpretation
In the context of the above interpretation of the holding times as the time between successive malfunctions of a machine, the "rewards" 
 
 
 
  (which in this case happen to be negative) may be viewed as the successive repair costs incurred as a result of the successive malfunctions.
An alternative analogy is that we have a magic goose which lays eggs at intervals (holding times) distributed as 
 
 
 
 . Sometimes it lays golden eggs of random weight, and sometimes it lays toxic eggs (also of random weight) which require responsible (and costly) disposal. The "rewards" 
 
 
 
  are the successive (random) financial losses/gains resulting from successive eggs (i = 1,2,3,...) and 
 
 
 
  records the total financial "reward" at time t.
Properties of renewal processes and renewal-reward processes
We define the renewal function as the expected value of the number of jumps observed up to some time 
 
 
 
 :



The elementary renewal theorem
The renewal function satisfies



Proof
Below, you find that the strong law of large numbers for renewal processes tell us that



To prove the elementary renewal theorem, it is sufficient to show that 
 
 
 
  is uniformly integrable.
To do this, consider some truncated renewal process where the holding times are defined by 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a point such that 
 
 
 
  which exists for all non-deterministic renewal processes. This new renewal process 
 
 
 
  is an upper bound on 
 
 
 
  and its renewals can only occur on the lattice 
 
 
 
 . Furthermore, the number of renewals at each time is geometric with parameter 
 
 
 
 . So we have



The elementary renewal theorem for renewal reward processes
We define the reward function:



The reward function satisfies



The renewal equation
The renewal function satisfies



where 
 
 
 
  is the cumulative distribution function of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the corresponding probability density function.
Proof of the renewal equation

We may iterate the expectation about the first holding time:
 










But by the Markov property











So
 







\begin{align} m(t) & {} = \mathbb{E}[X_t] \\[12pt] & {} = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}(X_t \mid S_1)] \\[12pt] & {} = \int_0^\infty \mathbb{E}(X_t \mid S_1=s) f_S(s)\, ds \\[12pt] & {} = \int_0^\infty \mathbb{I}_{\{t \geq s\}} \left( 1 + \mathbb{E}[X_{t-s}] \right) f_S(s)\, ds \\[12pt] & {} = \int_0^t \left( 1 + m(t-s) \right) f_S(s)\, ds \\[12pt] & {} = F_S(t) + \int_0^t m(t-s) f_S(s)\, ds, \end{align}

as required.
 

Asymptotic properties


 
  and 
 
 
 
  satisfy


 
  (strong law of large numbers for renewal processes)


 
  (strong law of large numbers for renewal-reward processes)
almost surely.
Proof

First consider 
 
 
 
 . By definition we have:
 










for all 
 
 
 
  and so
 







\frac{J_{X_t}}{X_t} \leq \frac{t}{X_t} \leq \frac{J_{X_t+1}}{X_t} 

for all t ≥ 0.
 


Now since 
 
 
 
  we have:
 










as 
 
 
almost surely (with probability 1). Hence:
 










almost surely (using the strong law of large numbers); similarly:
 










almost surely.
 


Thus (since 
 
 
 
  is sandwiched between the two terms)
 







\frac{1}{t} X_t \to \frac{1}{\mathbb{E}S_1} 

almost surely.
 


Next consider 
 
 
 
 . We have
 










almost surely (using the first result and using the law of large numbers on 
 
 
 
 ).
 

The inspection paradox
A curious feature of renewal processes is that if we wait some predetermined time t and then observe how large the renewal interval containing t is, we should expect it to be typically larger than a renewal interval of average size.
Mathematically the inspection paradox states: for any t > 0 the renewal interval containing t is stochastically larger than the first renewal interval. That is, for all x > 0 and for all t > 0:



where FS is the cumulative distribution function of the IID holding times Si.
Proof of the inspection paradox
(Figure)
The renewal interval determined by the random point t (shown in red) is stochastically larger than the first renewal interval.

Observe that the last jump-time before t is 
 
 
 
 ; and that the renewal interval containing t is 
 
 
 
 . Then



as required.
Superposition
The superposition of independent renewal processes is not generally a renewal process, but it can be described within a larger class of processes called the Markov-renewal processes.1 However, the cumulative distribution function of the first inter-event time in the superposition process is given by2








where Rk(t) and αk > 0 are the CDF of the inter-event times and the arrival rate of process k.3
Example applications
Example 1: use of the strong law of large numbers
Eric the entrepreneur has n machines, each having an operational lifetime uniformly distributed between zero and two years. Eric may let each machine run until it fails with replacement cost €2600; alternatively he may replace a machine at any time while it is still functional at a cost of €200.
What is his optimal replacement policy?
Solution
We may model the lifetime of the n machines as n independent concurrent renewal-reward processes, so it is sufficient to consider the case n=1. Denote this process by 
 
 
 
 . The successive lifetimes S of the replacement machines are independent and identically distributed, so the optimal policy is the same for all replacement machines in the process.
If Eric decides at the start of a machine's life to replace it at time 0  \begin{align} \mathbb{E}S & = \mathbb{E}[S \mid \mbox{fails before } t] \cdot \mathbb{P}[\mbox{fails before } t] + \mathbb{E}[S \mid \mbox{does not fail before } t] \cdot \mathbb{P}[\mbox{does not fail before } t] \\ & = \frac{t}{2}\left(0.5t\right) + \frac{2-t}{2}\left( t \right) \end{align} 
and the expected cost W per machine is:



So by the strong law of large numbers, his long-term average cost per unit time is:



then differentiating with respect to t:



this implies that the turning points satisfy:



and thus



We take the only solution t in [0, 2]: t = 2/3. This is indeed a minimum (and not a maximum) since the cost per unit time tends to infinity as t tends to zero, meaning that the cost is decreasing as t increases, until the point 2/3 where it starts to increase.
