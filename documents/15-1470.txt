Soyasapogenol glucuronosyltransferase

Soyasapogenol glucuronosyltransferase (, UGASGT) is an enzyme with system name UDP-D-glucuronate:soyasapogenol 3-O-D-glucuronosyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

UDP-glucuronate + soyasapogenol B 
 
 
 
  UDP + soyasapogenol B 3-O-D-glucuronide
 

This enzyme requires a divalent ion, Mg2+ or Mn2+, or Ca2+.
