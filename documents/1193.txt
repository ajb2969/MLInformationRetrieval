   Aryl-alcohol oxidase      Aryl-alcohol oxidase   In enzymology , an aryl-alcohol oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an aromatic primary alcohol + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   an aromatic aldehyde + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are aromatic primary alcohol and O 2 , whereas its two products are aromatic aldehyde and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aryl-alcohol:oxygen oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include aryl alcohol oxidase , veratryl alcohol oxidase , and arom. alcohol oxidase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
