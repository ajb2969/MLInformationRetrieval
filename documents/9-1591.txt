   Trade-weighted US dollar index      Trade-weighted US dollar index   The trade-weighted US dollar index , also known as the broad index , is a measure of the value of the United States dollar relative to other world currencies . It is similar to the U.S. Dollar Index in that its numerical value is determined as a weighted average of the price of various currencies relative to the dollar, but different currencies are used and relative values are weighted differently. The base index value is 100 in March 1973. 1  History  The trade-weighted dollar index was introduced in 1998 for two primary reasons. The first was the introduction of the euro , which eliminated several of the currencies in the standard dollar index; the second was to keep pace with new developments in US trade. 2  Included currencies  In the standard US dollar index, a significant weight is given to the euro. To more accurately reflect the strength of the dollar relative to other world currencies, the Federal Reserve created the trade-weighted US dollar index, 3 which includes a bigger collection of currencies than the US dollar index. The regions included are:   Europe (euro countries)  Canada  Japan  Mexico  China  United Kingdom  Taiwan  Korea  Singapore    Hong Kong  Malaysia  Brazil  Switzerland  Thailand  Philippines  Australia  Indonesia  India    Israel  Saudi Arabia  Russia  Sweden  Argentina  Venezuela  Chile  Colombia   Mathematical formulation  Based on nominal exchange rates  The index is computed as the geometric mean of the bilateral exchange rates of the included currencies. The weight assigned to the value of each currency in the calculation is based on trade data, and is updated annually (the value of the index itself is updated much more frequently than the weightings). 4 The index value at time   t   t   t   is given by the formula: 5       I  t   =    I   t  -  1    ×    ∏   j  =  1    N   (  t  )       (    e   j  ,  t     e   j  ,   t  -  1      )    w   j  ,  t            subscript  I  t      subscript  I    t  1      superscript   subscript  product    j  1      N  t     superscript     subscript  e   j  t     subscript  e   j    t  1       subscript  w   j  t         I_{t}=I_{t-1}\times\prod_{j=1}^{N(t)}\left(\frac{e_{j,t}}{e_{j,t-1}}\right)^{w%
 _{j,t}}   .  where       I  t     subscript  I  t    I_{t}   and    I   t  -  1      subscript  I    t  1     I_{t-1}   are the values of the index at times   t   t   t   and    t  -  1      t  1    t-1           N   (  t  )       N  t    N(t)   is the number of currencies in the index at time   t   t   t           e   j  ,  t      subscript  e   j  t     e_{j,t}   and    e   j  ,   t  -  1       subscript  e   j    t  1      e_{j,t-1}   are the exchange rates of currency   j   j   j   at times   t   t   t   and    t  -  1      t  1    t-1           w   j  ,  t      subscript  w   j  t     w_{j,t}   is the weight of currency   j   j   j   at time   t   t   t       and      ∑   j  =  1    N   (  t  )      w   j  ,  t     =  1        superscript   subscript     j  1      N  t     subscript  w   j  t     1    \sum_{j=1}^{N(t)}w_{j,t}=1      Based on real exchange rates  The real exchange rate is a more informative measure of the dollar's worth since it accounts for countries whose currencies experience differing rates of inflation from that of the United States. This is compensated for by adjusting the exchange rates in the formula using the consumer price index of the respective countries. In this more general case the index value is given by: 6       I  t   =    I   t  -  1    ×    ∏   j  =  1    N   (  t  )       (     e   j  ,  t    ⋅    p  t    p   j  ,  t        e   j  ,   t  -  1     ⋅    p   t  -  1     p   j  ,   t  -  1        )    w   j  ,  t            subscript  I  t      subscript  I    t  1      superscript   subscript  product    j  1      N  t     superscript     normal-⋅   subscript  e   j  t       subscript  p  t    subscript  p   j  t       normal-⋅   subscript  e   j    t  1        subscript  p    t  1     subscript  p   j    t  1         subscript  w   j  t         I_{t}=I_{t-1}\times\prod_{j=1}^{N(t)}\left(\frac{e_{j,t}\cdot\frac{p_{t}}{p_{j%
 ,t}}}{e_{j,t-1}\cdot\frac{p_{t-1}}{p_{j,t-1}}}\right)^{w_{j,t}}   .  where       p  t     subscript  p  t    p_{t}   and    p   t  -  1      subscript  p    t  1     p_{t-1}   are the values of the US consumer price index at times   t   t   t   and    t  -  1      t  1    t-1       and    p   j  ,  t      subscript  p   j  t     p_{j,t}   and    p   j  ,   t  -  1       subscript  p   j    t  1      p_{j,t-1}   are the values of the country   j   j   j   's consumer price index at times   t   t   t   and    t  -  1      t  1    t-1      References  External links   Trade weighted dollar indexes at St. Louis Fed   "  Category:Index numbers  Category:Economic indicators     ↩  ↩  http://www.federalreserve.gov/RELEASES/h10/Summary/ ↩
