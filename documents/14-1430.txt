   Lorenz 96 model      Lorenz 96 model   The Lorenz 96 model is a dynamical system formulated by Edward Lorenz in 1996. 1 It is defined as follows:        d   x  i     d  t    =      -    x   i  -  2     x   i  -  1      +    x   i  -  1     x   i  +  1      -   x  i    +  F           d   subscript  x  i      d  t               subscript  x    i  2     subscript  x    i  1         subscript  x    i  1     subscript  x    i  1       subscript  x  i    F     \frac{dx_{i}}{dt}=-x_{i-2}x_{i-1}+x_{i-1}x_{i+1}-x_{i}+F     where    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   is the state of the system and   F   F   F   is a forcing constant.    F  =  8      F  8    F=8   is a common value known to cause chaotic behavior.  It is commonly used as a model problem in data assimilation 2  References  "  Category:Dynamical systems     ↩  ↩
