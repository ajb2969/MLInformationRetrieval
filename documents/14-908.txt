Orthogonal projections in B 5  Coxeter plane |} In five-dimensional geometry , a runcinated 5-cube is a convex uniform 5-polytope that is a runcination (a 3rd order truncation) of the regular 5-cube .  There are unique 8 degrees of runcinations of the 5-cube, along with permutations of truncations, and cantellations. Four are more simply constructed relative to the 5-orthoplex .  {{-}}  Runcinated 5-cube      Runcinated 5-cube     Type     Schläfli symbol     Coxeter diagram     4-faces     Cells     Faces     Edges     Vertices     Vertex figure     Coxeter group     Properties     Alternate names   Small prismated penteract (Acronym: span) (Jonathan Bowers)   Coordinates  The Cartesian coordinates of the vertices of a runcinated 5-cube having edge length 2 are all permutations of:      (   ±  1   ,   ±  1   ,   ±  1   ,   ±   (   1  +   2    )    ,   ±   (   1  +   2    )    )      plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus    1    2      plus-or-minus    1    2       \left(\pm 1,\ \pm 1,\ \pm 1,\ \pm(1+\sqrt{2}),\ \pm(1+\sqrt{2})\right)     Images  Runcitruncated 5-cube      Runcitruncated 5-cube       Type     Schläfli symbol     Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams     4-faces     Cells     Faces     Edges     Vertices     Vertex figure     Coxeter groups     Properties     Alternate names   Runcitruncated penteract  Prismatotruncated penteract (Acronym: pattin) (Jonathan Bowers)   Construction and coordinates  The Cartesian coordinates of the vertices of a runcitruncated 5-cube having edge length 2 are all permutations of:      (   ±  1   ,   ±   (   1  +   2    )    ,   ±   (   1  +   2    )    ,   ±   (   1  +   2   2     )    ,   ±   (   1  +   2   2     )    )      plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus    1    2      plus-or-minus    1    2      plus-or-minus    1    2    2       plus-or-minus    1    2    2        \left(\pm 1,\ \pm(1+\sqrt{2}),\ \pm(1+\sqrt{2}),\ \pm(1+2\sqrt{2}),\ \pm(1+2%
