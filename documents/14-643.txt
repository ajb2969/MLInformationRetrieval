Hilbert's inequality

In analysis, a branch of mathematics, Hilbert's inequality states that



for any sequence u1,u2,... of complex numbers. It was first demonstrated by David Hilbert with the constant 2
 
 
 
  instead of 
 
 
 
 ; the sharp constant was found by Issai Schur. It implies that the discrete Hilbert transform is a bounded operator in ℓ2.
Formulation
Let (um) be a sequence of complex numbers. If the sequence is infinite, assume that it is square-summable:



Hilbert's inequality (see ) asserts that



Extensions
In 1973, Montgomery & Vaughan reported several generalizations of Hilbert's inequality, considering the bilinear forms



and



where x1,x2,...,xm are distinct real numbers modulo 1 (i.e. they belong to distinct classes in the quotient group R/Z) and λ1,...,λm are distinct real numbers. Montgomery & Vaughan's generalizations of Hilbert's inequality are then given by



and



where






is the distance from s to the nearest integer, and min+ denotes the smallest positive value. Moreover, if



then the following inequalities hold:



and
