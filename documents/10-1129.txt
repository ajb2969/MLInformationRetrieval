   Senecionine N-oxygenase      Senecionine N-oxygenase   In enzymology , a senecionine N-oxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   senecionine + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   senecionine N-oxide + NADP + + H 2 O   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are senecionine , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are senecionine N-oxide , NADP + , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is senecionine,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (N-oxide-forming) . Other names in common use include senecionine monooxygenase (N-oxide-forming) , and SNO .
