   Appell–Humbert theorem      Appell–Humbert theorem   In mathematics , the Appell–Humbert theorem describes the line bundles on a complex torus or complex abelian variety . It was proved for 2-dimensional tori by  and , and in general by  Statement  Suppose that T is a complex torus given by V / U where U is a lattice in a complex vector space V . If H is a Hermitian form on V whose imaginary part E is integral on U × U , and α is a map from U to the unit circle such that       α   (   u  +  v   )    =    e   i  π  E   (  u  ,  v  )     α   (  u  )   α   (  v  )          α    u  v       superscript  e    i  π  E   u  v     α  u  α  v     \alpha(u+v)=e^{i\pi E(u,v)}\alpha(u)\alpha(v)     then      α   (  u  )    e    π  H   (  z  ,  u  )    +    H   (  u  ,  u  )   π   /  2         α  u   superscript  e      π  H   z  u        H   u  u   π   2       \alpha(u)e^{\pi H(z,u)+H(u,u)\pi/2}     is a 1- cocycle on U defining a line bundle on T .  The Appell–Humbert theorem  says that every line bundle on T can be constructed like this for a unique choice of H and α satisfying the conditions above.  Ample line bundles  Lefschetz proved that the line bundle L , associated to the Hermitian form H is ample if and only if H is positive definite, and in this case L 3 is very ample. A consequence is that the complex torus is algebraic if and only if there is a positive definite Hermitian form whose imaginary part is integral on U × U .
