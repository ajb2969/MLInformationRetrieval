List of things named after Joseph Fourier

This is a list of things named after Joseph Fourier:
Mathematics

Fourier's theorem
Fourier algebra
Fourier division

Analysis

Fourier analysis
Fourier series (Generalized Fourier series)
 
Fourier-Bessel series
Laplace-Fourier series, see Laplace series

Fourier transform (List of Fourier-related transforms):
 

Discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), the reverse of the Fourier series, a special case of the Z-transform around the unit circle in the complex plane
Discrete Fourier transform (DFT), occasionally called the finite Fourier transform, the Fourier transform of a discrete periodic sequence (yielding discrete periodic frequencies), which can also be thought of as the DTFT of a finite-length sequence evaluated at discrete frequencies
Fast Fourier transform (FFT), a fast algorithm for computing a Discrete Fourier transform
Finite Fourier transform
Fractional Fourier transform (FRFT), a linear transformation generalizing the Fourier transform, used in the area of harmonic analysis

Fourier–Deligne transform
Fourier–Mukai transform


In physics and engineering

Fourier's law of heat conduction
Fourier number (
 
 
 
 ) (also known as the Fourier modulus), a ratio 
 
 
 
  of the rate of heat conduction 
 
 
 
  to the rate of thermal energy storage 
 
 

Fourier optics
Fourier transform spectroscopy, a measurement technique whereby spectra are collected based on measurements of the temporal coherence of a radiative source
