   Glycerol-2-phosphatase      Glycerol-2-phosphatase   In enzymology , a glycerol-2-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   glycerol 2-phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycerol + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glycerol 2-phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are glycerol and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycerol-2-phosphate phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include beta-glycerophosphatase , beta-glycerophosphate phosphatase , and 2-glycerophosphatase .  References   Boyer, P.D., Lardy, H. and Myrback, K.
