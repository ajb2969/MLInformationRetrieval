6,7-dihydropteridine reductase

In enzymology, a 6,7-dihydropteridine reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

a 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridine + NAD(P)+ 
 
 
 
  a 6,7-dihydropteridine + NAD(P)H + H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridine, NAD+, and NADP+, whereas its 4 products are 6,7-dihydropteridine, NADH, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridine:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include 6,7-dihydropteridine:NAD(P)H oxidoreductase, DHPR, NAD(P)H:6,7-dihydropteridine oxidoreductase, NADH-dihydropteridine reductase, NADPH-dihydropteridine reductase, NADPH-specific dihydropteridine reductase, dihydropteridine (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), reductase, dihydropteridine reductase, dihydropteridine reductase (NADH), and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridine:NAD(P)H+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in folate biosynthesis.
