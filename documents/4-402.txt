   Canonical coordinates      Canonical coordinates   In mathematics and classical mechanics , canonical coordinates are sets of coordinates which can be used to describe a physical system at any given point in time (locating the system within phase space ). Canonical coordinates are used in the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics . A closely related concept also appears in quantum mechanics ; see the Stone–von Neumann theorem and canonical commutation relations for details.  As Hamiltonian mechanics is generalized by symplectic geometry and canonical transformations are generalized by contact transformations , so the 19th century definition of canonical coordinates in classical mechanics may be generalized to a more abstract 20th century definition of coordinates on the cotangent bundle of a manifold .  Definition, in classical mechanics  In classical mechanics , canonical coordinates are coordinates     q  i      subscript  q  i    q_{i}\,   and     p  i      subscript  p  i    p_{i}\,   in phase space that are used in the Hamiltonian formalism. The canonical coordinates satisfy the fundamental Poisson bracket relations:        {   q  i   ,   q  j   }   =  0      {   p  i   ,   p  j   }   =  0     {   q  i   ,   p  j   }   =   δ   i  j         formulae-sequence      subscript  q  i    subscript  q  j    0    formulae-sequence      subscript  p  i    subscript  p  j    0       subscript  q  i    subscript  p  j     subscript  δ    i  j        \{q_{i},q_{j}\}=0\qquad\{p_{i},p_{j}\}=0\qquad\{q_{i},p_{j}\}=\delta_{ij}     A typical example of canonical coordinates is for    q  i     subscript  q  i    q_{i}   to be the usual Cartesian coordinates , and    p  i     subscript  p  i    p_{i}   to be the components of momentum . Hence in general, the    p  i     subscript  p  i    p_{i}   coordinates are referred to as "conjugate momenta."  Canonical coordinates can be obtained from the generalized coordinates of the Lagrangian formalism by a Legendre transformation , or from another set of canonical coordinates by a canonical transformation .  Definition, on cotangent bundles  Canonical coordinates are defined as a special set of coordinates on the cotangent bundle of a manifold . They are usually written as a set of    (   q  i   ,   p  j   )      superscript  q  i    subscript  p  j     (q^{i},p_{j})   or    (   x  i   ,   p  j   )      superscript  x  i    subscript  p  j     (x^{i},p_{j})   with the x 's or q 's denoting the coordinates on the underlying manifold and the p 's denoting the conjugate momentum , which are 1-forms in the cotangent bundle at point q in the manifold.  A common definition of canonical coordinates is any set of coordinates on the cotangent bundle that allow the canonical one-form to be written in the form       ∑  i      p  i    d   q  i        subscript   i      subscript  p  i   normal-d   superscript  q  i      \sum_{i}p_{i}\,\mathrm{d}q^{i}     up to a total differential. A change of coordinates that preserves this form is a canonical transformation ; these are a special case of a symplectomorphism , which are essentially a change of coordinates on a symplectic manifold .  In the following exposition, we assume that the manifolds are real manifolds, so that cotangent vectors acting on tangent vectors produce real numbers.  Formal development  Given a manifold Q , a vector field  X on Q (or equivalently, a section of the tangent bundle  TQ ) can be thought of as a function acting on the cotangent bundle , by the duality between the tangent and cotangent spaces. That is, define a function       P  X   :     T  *   Q   →  ℝ      normal-:   subscript  P  X    normal-→     superscript  T    Q   ℝ     P_{X}:T^{*}Q\to\mathbb{R}   such that        P  X    (  q  ,  p  )    =   p   (   X  q   )           subscript  P  X    q  p      p   subscript  X  q      P_{X}(q,p)=p(X_{q})   holds for all cotangent vectors p in     T  q  *   Q       superscript   subscript  T  q     Q    T_{q}^{*}Q   . Here,    X  q     subscript  X  q    X_{q}   is a vector in     T  q   Q       subscript  T  q   Q    T_{q}Q   , the tangent space to the manifold Q at point q . The function    P  X     subscript  P  X    P_{X}   is called the momentum function corresponding to X .  In local coordinates , the vector field X at point q may be written as       X  q   =    ∑  i     X  i    (  q  )    ∂   ∂   q  i            subscript  X  q     subscript   i      superscript  X  i   q        superscript  q  i         X_{q}=\sum_{i}X^{i}(q)\frac{\partial}{\partial q^{i}}   where the    ∂  /   ∂   q  i            superscript  q  i      \partial/\partial q^{i}   are the coordinate frame on TQ. The conjugate momentum then has the expression        P  X    (  q  ,  p  )    =    ∑  i     X  i    (  q  )    p  i            subscript  P  X    q  p      subscript   i      superscript  X  i   q   subscript  p  i       P_{X}(q,p)=\sum_{i}X^{i}(q)\;p_{i}   where the    p  i     subscript  p  i    p_{i}   are defined as the momentum functions corresponding to the vectors    ∂  /   ∂   q  i            superscript  q  i      \partial/\partial q^{i}   :       p  i   =   P   ∂  /   ∂   q  i           subscript  p  i    subscript  P        superscript  q  i        p_{i}=P_{\partial/\partial q^{i}}   The    q  i     superscript  q  i    q^{i}   together with the    p  j     subscript  p  j    p_{j}   together form a coordinate system on the cotangent bundle     T  *   Q       superscript  T    Q    T^{*}Q   ; these coordinates are called the canonical coordinates .  Generalized coordinates  In Lagrangian mechanics , a different set of coordinates are used, called the generalized coordinates . These are commonly denoted as    (   q  i   ,    q  ˙   i   )      superscript  q  i    superscript   normal-˙  q   i     (q^{i},\dot{q}^{i})   with    q  i     superscript  q  i    q^{i}   called the generalized position and     q  ˙   i     superscript   normal-˙  q   i    \dot{q}^{i}   the generalized velocity . When a Hamiltonian is defined on the cotangent bundle, then the generalized coordinates are related to the canonical coordinates by means of the Hamilton–Jacobi equations .
