Aharonov–Casher effect

The Aharonov–Casher effect is a quantum mechanical phenomenon predicted in 1984 in which a traveling magnetic dipole is affected by an electric field. It is dual to the Aharonov–Bohm effect, in which the quantum phase of a charged particle depends upon which side of a magnetic flux tube it comes through. In the Aharonov–Casher effect, the particle has a magnetic moment and the tubes are charged instead. It was observed in a gravitational neutron inferometer in 1989(Cimmino et al) and later by fluxon interferenceof magnetic vorticesin Josephson junctions (Elion et al). It has also been seen with electrons and atoms.
In both effects the particle acquires a phase shift (
 
 
 
 ) while traveling along some path P. In the Aharonov–Bohm effect it is
