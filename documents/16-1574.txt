   Cramer–Castillon problem      Cramer–Castillon problem   (Figure)  To find the inscribed triangles in   Z   Z   Z   , whose sides pass through    A  ,  B  ,  C     A  B  C    A,B,C      In geometry , the Cramer–Castillon problem is a problem stated by the Swiss  mathematician  Gabriel Cramer solved by the italian mathematician, resident in Berlin, Jean de Castillon in 1776. 1  The problem consists of (see the image):  Given a circle   Z   Z   Z   and three points    A  ,  B  ,  C     A  B  C    A,B,C   in the same plane and not on   Z   Z   Z   , to construct every possible triangle inscribed in   Z   Z   Z   whose sides (or their elongations) pass through    A  ,  B  ,  C     A  B  C    A,B,C   respectively.  Centuries before, Pappus of Alexandria had solved a special case: when the three points are collinear. But the general case had the reputation of being very difficult. 2  After the geometrical construction of Castillon, Lagrange found an analytic solution, easier than Castillon's. In the beginning of the 19th century, Lazare Carnot generalized it to   n   n   n   points. 3  References  Bibliography       External links     "  Category:Geometry     , page 1. ↩  , page 59. ↩  , page 176. ↩
