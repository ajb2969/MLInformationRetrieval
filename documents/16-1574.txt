In geometry, the Cramer–Castillon problem is a problem stated by the Swiss mathematician Gabriel Cramer solved by the italian mathematician, resident in Berlin, Jean de Castillon in 1776.1
The problem consists of (see the image):
Given a circle 
 
 
 
  and three points 
 
 
 
  in the same plane and not on 
 
 
 
 , to construct every possible triangle inscribed in 
 
 
 
  whose sides (or their elongations) pass through 
 
 
 
  respectively.
Centuries before, Pappus of Alexandria had solved a special case: when the three points are collinear. But the general case had the reputation of being very difficult.2
After the geometrical construction of Castillon, Lagrange found an analytic solution, easier than Castillon's. In the beginning of the 19th century, Lazare Carnot generalized it to 
 
 
 
  points.3
