   Prüfer group      Prüfer group   In mathematics , specifically in group theory , the Prüfer p -group or the p -quasicyclic group or p ∞ -group, Z ( p ∞ ), for a prime number  p is the unique p -group in which every element has p different p -th roots. The group is named after Heinz Prüfer . It is a countable  abelian group which helps taxonomize infinite abelian groups.  Constructions of Z ( p ∞ )  The Prüfer p -group may be identified with the subgroup of the circle group , U(1), consisting of all p n -th roots of unity as n ranges over all non-negative integers:        𝐙   (   p  ∞   )    =   {   exp   (    2  π  i  m   /   p  n    )    ∣    m  ∈   𝐙  +    ,   n  ∈   𝐙  +     }    .        𝐙   superscript  p      conditional-set        2  π  i  m    superscript  p  n      formulae-sequence    m   superscript  𝐙       n   superscript  𝐙         \mathbf{Z}(p^{\infty})=\{\exp(2\pi im/p^{n})\mid m\in\mathbf{Z}^{+},\,n\in%
 \mathbf{Z}^{+}\}.\;   The group operation here is the multiplication of complex numbers.  Alternatively, the Prüfer p -group may be seen as the Sylow p-subgroup of the quotient group  Q / Z , consisting of those elements whose order is a power of p :       𝐙   (   p  ∞   )    =    𝐙   [   1  /  p   ]    /  𝐙         𝐙   superscript  p         𝐙   delimited-[]    1  p     𝐙     \mathbf{Z}(p^{\infty})=\mathbf{Z}[1/p]/\mathbf{Z}   (where Z [1/ p ] denotes the group of all rational numbers whose denominator is a power of p , using addition of rational numbers as group operation).  We can also write       𝐙   (   p  ∞   )    =    𝐐  p   /   𝐙  p          𝐙   superscript  p        subscript  𝐐  p    subscript  𝐙  p      \mathbf{Z}(p^{\infty})=\mathbf{Q}_{p}/\mathbf{Z}_{p}   where Q p denotes the additive group of p -adic numbers and Z p is the subgroup of p -adic integers.  There is a presentation        𝐙   (   p  ∞   )    =   ⟨    g  1   ,   g  2   ,   g  3   ,  …   ∣     g  1  p   =  1   ,     g  2  p   =   g  1    ,    g  3  p   =    g  2   ,   …       ⟩    .        𝐙   superscript  p      inner-product    subscript  g  1    subscript  g  2    subscript  g  3   normal-…    formulae-sequence     superscript   subscript  g  1   p   1    formulae-sequence     superscript   subscript  g  2   p    subscript  g  1       superscript   subscript  g  3   p     subscript  g  2   normal-…         \mathbf{Z}(p^{\infty})=\langle\,g_{1},g_{2},g_{3},\ldots\mid g_{1}^{p}=1,g_{2}%
 ^{p}=g_{1},g_{3}^{p}=g_{2},\dots\,\rangle.   Here, the group operation in Z ( p ∞ ) is written as multiplication.  Properties  The Prüfer p -groups for all primes p are the only infinite groups whose subgroups are totally ordered by inclusion:      0  ⊂    (    1  p   𝐙   )   /  𝐙   ⊂    (    1   p  2    𝐙   )   /  𝐙   ⊂    (    1   p  3    𝐙   )   /  𝐙   ⊂  ⋯  ⊂   𝐙   (   p  ∞   )          0        1  p   𝐙   𝐙              1   superscript  p  2    𝐙   𝐙              1   superscript  p  3    𝐙   𝐙        normal-⋯         𝐙   superscript  p        0\subset\left({1\over p}\mathbf{Z}\right)/\mathbf{Z}\subset\left({1\over p^{2}%
 }\mathbf{Z}\right)/\mathbf{Z}\subset\left({1\over p^{3}}\mathbf{Z}\right)/%
 \mathbf{Z}\subset\cdots\subset\mathbf{Z}(p^{\infty})   (Here     (    1   p  n    𝐙   )   /  𝐙          1   superscript  p  n    𝐙   𝐙    \left({1\over p^{n}}\mathbf{Z}\right)/\mathbf{Z}   is a cyclic subgroup of Z ( p ∞ ) with p n elements; it contains precisely those elements of Z ( p ∞ ) whose order divides p n and corresponds to the set of p n -th roots of unity.) This sequence of inclusions expresses the Prüfer p -group as the direct limit of its finite subgroups. As there is no maximal subgroup of a Prüfer p -group, it is its own Frattini subgroup .  Given this list of subgroups, it is clear that the Prüfer p -groups are indecomposable (cannot be written as a direct sum of proper subgroups). More is true: the Prüfer p -groups are subdirectly irreducible . An abelian group is subdirectly irreducible if and only if it is isomorphic to a finite cyclic p -group or to a Prüfer group.  The Prüfer p -group is the unique infinite p -group which is locally cyclic (every finite set of elements generates a cyclic group). As seen above, all proper subgroups of Z ( p ∞ ) are finite. The Prüfer p -groups are the only infinite abelian groups with this property. 1  The Prüfer p -groups are divisible . They play an important role in the classification of divisible groups; along with the rational numbers they are the simplest divisible groups. More precisely: an abelian group is divisible if and only if it is the direct sum of a (possibly infinite) number of copies of Q and (possibly infinite) numbers of copies of Z ( p ∞ ) for every prime p . The numbers of copies of Q and Z ( p ∞ ) that are used in this direct sum determine the divisible group up to isomorphism. 2  As an abelian group (that is, as a Z -module ), Z ( p ∞ ) is Artinian but not Noetherian . 3 It can thus be used as a counterexample against the idea that every Artinian module is Noetherian (whereas every Artinian ring is Noetherian).  The endomorphism ring of Z ( p ∞ ) is isomorphic to the ring of p -adic integers  Z p . 4  In the theory of locally compact topological groups the Prüfer p -group (endowed with the discrete topology ) is the Pontryagin dual of the compact group of p-adic integers , and the group of p -adic integers is the Pontryagin dual of the Prüfer p -group. 5  See also   p -adic integers , which can be defined as the inverse limit of the finite subgroups of the Prüfer p -group.  Dyadic rational , rational numbers of the form a /2 b . The Prüfer 2-group can be viewed as the dyadic rationals modulo 1.
