Xanthommatin reductase

In enzymology, a xanthommatin reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

5,12-dihydroxanthommatin + NAD+

 
  xanthommatin + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5,12-dihydroxanthommatin and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are xanthommatin, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,12-dihydroxanthommatin:NAD+ oxidoreductase.
