   Cellodextrin phosphorylase      Cellodextrin phosphorylase   In enzymology , a cellodextrin phosphorylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (1,4-beta-D- glucosyl )n + phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (1,4-beta-D-glucosyl)n-1 + alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (1,4-beta-D-glucosyl)n and phosphate , whereas its two products are (1,4-beta-D-glucosyl)n-1 and alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to GH (glycoside hydrolases) family 94. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,4-beta-D-oligo-D-glucan:phosphate alpha-D-glucosyltransferase . This enzyme is also called beta-1,4-oligoglucan:orthophosphate glucosyltransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
