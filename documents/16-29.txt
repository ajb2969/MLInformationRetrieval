Terpentetriene synthase

Terpentetriene synthase (, Cyc2) is an enzyme with system name terpentedienyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (terpentetriene-forming).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

terpentedienyl diphosphate 
 
 
terpentetriene + diphosphate


This enzyme requires Mg2+ for maximal activity but can use Mn2+, Fe2+ or Co2+ to a lesser extent.
