   Terpentetriene synthase      Terpentetriene synthase   Terpentetriene synthase (, Cyc2 ) is an enzyme with system name terpentedienyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (terpentetriene-forming) . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   terpentedienyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    terpentetriene + diphosphate    This enzyme requires Mg 2+ for maximal activity but can use Mn 2+ , Fe 2+ or Co 2+ to a lesser extent.
