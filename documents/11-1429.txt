ADP-specific phosphofructokinase




ADP-specific phosphofructokinase

In enzymology, an ADP-specific phosphofructokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ADP + D-fructose 6-phosphate 
 
 
 
  AMP + D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ADP and D-fructose 6-phosphate, whereas its two products are AMP and D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ADP:D-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase. This enzyme is also called ADP-6-phosphofructokinase, ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
