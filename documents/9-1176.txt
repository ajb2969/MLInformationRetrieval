   Residue field      Residue field   In mathematics , the residue field is a basic construction in commutative algebra . If R is a commutative ring and m is a maximal ideal , then the residue field is the quotient ring  k = R / m , which is a field . 1 Frequently, R is a local ring and m is then its unique maximal ideal.  This construction is applied in algebraic geometry , where to every point x of a scheme  X one associates its residue field  k ( x ). 2 One can say a little loosely that the residue field of a point of an abstract algebraic variety is the 'natural domain' for the coordinates of the point.  Definition  Suppose that R is a commutative local ring , with the maximal ideal m . Then the residue field is the quotient ring R / m .  Now suppose that X is a scheme and x is a point of X . By the definition of scheme, we may find an affine neighbourhood U = Spec( A ), with A some commutative ring . Considered in the neighbourhood U , the point x corresponds to a prime ideal  p ⊂ A (see Zariski topology ). The local ring of X in x is by definition the localization  R = A p , with the maximal ideal m = p·A p . Applying the construction above, we obtain the '''residue field of the point x ''':   k ( x ) := A p / p · A p .   One can prove that this definition does not depend on the choice of the affine neighbourhood U . 3  A point is called K -rational for a certain field K , if k ( x ) ⊂ K . 4  Example  Consider the affine line  A 1 ( k ) = Spec( k [ t ]) over a field  k . If k is algebraically closed , there are exactly two types of prime ideals, namely   ( t − a ), a ∈ k  (0), the zero-ideal.   The residue fields are          k    [  t  ]    (   t  -  a   )     /   (   t  -  a   )    k    [  t  ]    (   t  -  a   )     ≅  k            k   subscript   delimited-[]  t     t  a       t  a    k   subscript   delimited-[]  t     t  a     k    k[t]_{(t-a)}/(t-a)k[t]_{(t-a)}\cong k          k    [  t  ]    (  0  )     ≅   k   (  t  )          k   subscript   delimited-[]  t   0      k  t     k[t]_{(0)}\cong k(t)   , the function field over k in one variable.   If k is not algebraically closed, then more types arise, for example if k = R , then the prime ideal ( x 2 + 1) has residue field isomorphic to C .  Properties   For a scheme locally of finite type over a field k , a point x is closed if and only if k ( x ) is a finite extension of the base field k . This is a geometric formulation of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz . In the above example, the points of the first kind are closed, having residue field k , whereas the second point is the generic point , having transcendence degree 1 over k .  A morphism Spec( K ) → X , K some field, is equivalent to giving a point x ∈ X and an extension  K / k ( x ).  The dimension of a scheme of finite type over a field is equal to the transcendence degree of the residue field of the generic point.
