   Planck charge      Planck charge   In physics , the Planck charge , denoted by    q  P     subscript  q  P    q_{\text{P}}   , is one of the base units in the system of natural units called Planck units . It is a quantity of electric charge defined in terms of fundamental physical constants .  The Planck charge is defined as: 1  2       q  P   =    4  π   ϵ  0   ℏ  c    =   e   α    =   1.875 5459  ×   10   -  18            subscript  q  P       4  π   subscript  ϵ  0   Planck-constant-over-2-pi  c           e    α           1.875 5459   superscript  10    18        q_{\text{P}}=\sqrt{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\hbar c}=\frac{e}{\sqrt{\alpha}}=1.875\;545%
 9\times 10^{-18}    coulombs ,  where:     c   c   c   is the speed of light in the vacuum ,     ℏ   Planck-constant-over-2-pi   \hbar   is the reduced Planck constant ,      ϵ  0     subscript  ϵ  0    \epsilon_{0}   is the permittivity of free space     e   e   e   is the elementary charge     α   α   \alpha   is the fine structure constant .  The Planck charge is     α   -   1  /  2     ≈  11.706       superscript  α      1  2     11.706    \alpha^{-1/2}\approx 11.706   times larger than the elementary charge  e carried by an electron .  The Gaussian cgs units are defined so that     4  π   ϵ  0    =  1        4  π   subscript  ϵ  0    1    4\pi\epsilon_{0}=1   , in which case    q  P     subscript  q  P    q_{\text{P}}   has the following simple form:        q  P   =    ℏ  c     .       subscript  q  P       Planck-constant-over-2-pi  c      q_{\text{P}}=\sqrt{\hbar c}.     It is customary in theoretical physics to adopt the Lorentz–Heaviside units (also known as rationalized cgs). When made natural (    c  =  1      c  1    c=1   ) they are like the SI system with     ϵ  0   =   μ  0   =  1         subscript  ϵ  0    subscript  μ  0        1     \epsilon_{0}=\mu_{0}=1   . Therefore it is more appropriate to define the Planck charge as       q  P  ′   =     ϵ  0   ℏ  c    =   e    4  π  α     =   5.291  ×   10   -  19            subscript   superscript  q  normal-′   P        subscript  ϵ  0   Planck-constant-over-2-pi  c           e      4  π  α            5.291   superscript  10    19        q^{\prime}_{\text{P}}=\sqrt{\epsilon_{0}\hbar c}=\frac{e}{\sqrt{4\pi\alpha}}=5%
 .291\times 10^{-19}    coulombs ,  When charges are measured in units of    q  P  ′     subscript   superscript  q  normal-′   P    q^{\prime}_{\text{P}}   , i.e., when    q  P  ′     subscript   superscript  q  normal-′   P    q^{\prime}_{\text{P}}   is set equal to 1, we obtain    α  =    e  2    4  π        α     superscript  e  2     4  π      \alpha=\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi}   , which is commonly used in theoretical physics. In contrast, in (non-rationalized) natural cgs units where     q  P   =  1       subscript  q  P   1    q_{\text{P}}=1   we have    α  =   e  2       α   superscript  e  2     \alpha=e^{2}   .
