Smooth maximum

In mathematics, a smooth maximum of an indexed family x1, ..., xn of numbers is a differentiable approximation to the maximum function



and the concept of smooth minimum is similarly defined.
For large positive values of the parameter 
 
 
 
 , the following formulation is one smooth, differentiable approximation of the maximum function. For negative values of the parameter that are large in absolute value, it approximates the minimum.



 
  has the following properties:



 
  as 
 
 



 
  is the average of its inputs


 
  as 
 
 


The gradient of 
 
 
 
  is closely related to softmax and is given by



This makes the softmax function useful for optimization techniques that use gradient descent.
Another formulation is:
