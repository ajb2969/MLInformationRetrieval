   Oxaloglycolate reductase (decarboxylating)      Oxaloglycolate reductase (decarboxylating)   In enzymology , an oxaloglycolate reductase (decarboxylating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-glycerate + NAD(P) + + CO 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-hydroxy-3-oxosuccinate + NAD(P)H + 2 H +    The 4 substrates of this enzyme are D-glycerate , NAD + , NADP + , and CO 2 , whereas its 4 products are 2-hydroxy-3-oxosuccinate , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glycerate:NAD(P) + oxidoreductase (carboxylating) . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism .
