Ballistic limit




Ballistic limit

The ballistic limit or limit velocity is the velocity required for a particular projectile to reliably (at least 50% of the time) penetrate a particular piece of material. In other words, a given projectile will not pierce a given target when the projectile velocity is lower than the ballistic limit.1 The term ballistic limit is used specifically in the context of armor; limit velocity is used in other contexts.2
The ballistic limit equation for laminates, as derived by Reid and Wen3 is as follows:



 where



 
  is the ballistic limit


 
  is a projectile constant determined experimentally


 
 
  is the density of the laminate


 
  is the static linear elastic compression limit


 
  is the diameter of the projectile


 
  is the thickness of the laminate


 
  is the mass of the projectile

Additionally, the ballistic limit for small-caliber into homogeneous armor by TM5-855-1 is:



 where



 
  is the ballistic limit velocity in fps


 
  is the caliber of the projectile, in inches


 
  is the thickness of the homogeneous armor (valid from BHN 360 - 440) in inches


 
  is the angle of obliquity


 
 
  is the weight of the projetile, in lbs
