   Ballistic limit      Ballistic limit   The ballistic limit or limit velocity is the velocity required for a particular projectile to reliably (at least 50% of the time) penetrate a particular piece of material. In other words, a given projectile will not pierce a given target when the projectile velocity is lower than the ballistic limit. 1 The term ballistic limit is used specifically in the context of armor ; limit velocity is used in other contexts. 2  The ballistic limit equation for laminates , as derived by Reid and Wen 3 is as follows:       V  b   =      π    Γ        ρ  t     σ  e        D  2    T     4   m     [   1  +     1  +     8   m     π     Γ  2      ρ  t      D  2    T        ]         subscript  V  b         π  normal-Γ       subscript  ρ  t    subscript  σ  e      superscript  D  2   T     4  m     delimited-[]    1      1      8  m     π   superscript  normal-Γ  2    subscript  ρ  t    superscript  D  2   T           V_{b}=\frac{\pi\,\Gamma\,\sqrt{\rho_{t}\,\sigma_{e}}\,D^{2}\,T}{4\,m}\left[1+%
