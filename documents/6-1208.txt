Bullet-nose curve

 In mathematics, a bullet-nose curve is a unicursal quartic curve with three inflection points, given by the equation



The bullet curve has three double points in the real projective plane, at x=0 and y=0, x=0 and z=0, and y=0 and z=0, and is therefore a unicursal (rational) curve of genus zero.
