   Jensen hierarchy      Jensen hierarchy   In set theory , a mathematical discipline, the Jensen hierarchy or J-hierarchy is a modification of Gödel 's constructible hierarchy , L, that circumvents certain technical difficulties that exist in the constructible hierarchy. The J-Hierarchy figures prominently in fine structure theory , a field pioneered by Ronald Jensen , for whom the Jensen hierarchy is named.  Definition  As in the definition of L , let Def( X ) be the collection of sets definable with parameters over X :   Def( X ) = { { y | y ε X and Φ( y , z 1 , ..., z n ) is true in ( X , ε)} | Φ is a first order formula and z 1 , ..., z n are elements of X }.   The constructible hierarchy, L is defined by transfinite recursion . In particular, at successor ordinals, L α+1 = Def( L α ).  The difficulty with this construction is that each of the levels is not closed under the formation of unordered pairs ; for a given x, y ε L α+1 − L α , the set { x , y } will not be an element of L α+1 , since it is not a subset of L α .  However, L α does have the desirable property of being closed under Σ 0  separation .  Jensen's modified hierarchy retains this property and the slightly weaker condition that      J   α  +  1    ∩   Pow   (   J  α   )     =   Def   (   J  α   )           subscript  J    α  1      Pow   subscript  J  α       Def   subscript  J  α      J_{\alpha+1}\cap\textrm{Pow}(J_{\alpha})=\textrm{Def}(J_{\alpha})   , but is also closed under pairing. The key technique is to encode hereditarily definable sets over J α by codes; then J α+1 will contain all sets whose codes are in J α .  Like L α , J α is defined recursively . For each ordinal α, we define    W  n  α     subscript   superscript  W  α   n    W^{\alpha}_{n}   to be a universal Σ n predicate for J α . We encode hereditarily definable sets as      X  α    (   n  +  1   ,  e  )    =   {   X   (  n  ,  f  )    ∣    W   n  +  1   α    (  e  ,  f  )    }          subscript  X  α      n  1   e     conditional-set    X   n  f       subscript   superscript  W  α     n  1     e  f       X_{\alpha}(n+1,e)=\{X(n,f)\mid W^{\alpha}_{n+1}(e,f)\}   , with      X  α    (  0  ,  e  )    =  e         subscript  X  α    0  e    e    X_{\alpha}(0,e)=e   . Then set J α, n to be {X(n, e) | e in J α }. Finally, J α+1 =     ⋃   n  ∈  ω     J   α  ,  n        subscript     n  ω     subscript  J   α  n      \bigcup_{n\in\omega}J_{\alpha,n}   .  Properties  Each sublevel J α , n is transitive and contains all ordinals less than or equal to αω + n . The sequence of sublevels is strictly increasing in n , since a Σ m predicate is also Σ n for any n > m . The levels J α will thus be transitive and strictly increasing as well, and are also closed under pairing, Delta-0 comprehension and transitive closure. Moreover, they have the property that         J   α  +  1    ∩   Pow   (   J  α   )     =   Def   (   J  α   )     ,         subscript  J    α  1      Pow   subscript  J  α       Def   subscript  J  α      J_{\alpha+1}\cap\text{Pow}(J_{\alpha})=\text{Def}(J_{\alpha}),     as desired.  The levels and sublevels are themselves Σ 1 uniformly definable [i.e. the definition of J α , n in J β does not depend on β ], and have a uniform Σ 1 well-ordering. Finally, the levels of the Jensen hierarchy satisfy a condensation lemma much like the levels of Godel's original hierarchy.
