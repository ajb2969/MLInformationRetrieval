   Lawvere theory      Lawvere theory   In category theory , a Lawvere theory (named after American  mathematician  William Lawvere ) is a category which can be considered a categorical counterpart of the notion of an equational theory .  Definition  Let    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   be a skeleton of the category FinSet of finite sets and functions . Formally, a Lawvere theory consists of a small category  L with (strictly associative ) finite products and a strict identity-on-objects functor     I  :    ℵ  0  op   →  L      normal-:  I   normal-→   superscript   subscript  normal-ℵ  0   op   L     I:\aleph_{0}^{\text{op}}\rightarrow L   preserving finite products.  A model of a Lawvere theory in a category C with finite products is a finite-product preserving functor . A morphism of models where M and N are models of L is a natural transformation of functors.  Category of Lawvere theories  A map between Lawvere theories ( L , I ) and ( L ′, I ′) is a finite-product preserving functor which commutes with I and I ′. Such a map is commonly seen as an interpretation of ( L , I ) in ( L ′, I ′).  Lawvere theories together with maps between them form the category Law .
