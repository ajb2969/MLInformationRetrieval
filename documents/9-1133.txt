   Symbol of a differential operator      Symbol of a differential operator   In mathematics , the symbol of a linear differential operator associates to a differential operator a polynomial by, roughly speaking, replacing each partial derivative by a new variable. The symbol of a differential operator has broad applications to Fourier analysis . In particular, in this connection it leads to the notion of a pseudo-differential operator . The highest-order terms of the symbol, known as the principal symbol, almost completely controls the qualitative behavior of solutions of a partial differential equation . Linear elliptic partial differential equations can be characterized as those whose principal symbol is nowhere zero. In the study of hyperbolic and parabolic partial differential equations , zeros of the principal symbol correspond to the characteristics of the partial differential equation. Consequently, the symbol is often fundamental for the solution of such equations, and is one of the main computational devices used to study their singularities.  Definition  Operators on Euclidean space  Let P be a linear differential operator of order k on the Euclidean space  R d . Then P is a polynomial in the derivative D , which in multi-index notation can be written       P  =   p   (  x  ,  D  )    =    ‚àë    |  Œ±  |   ‚â§  k      a  Œ±    (  x  )    D  Œ±      .        P    p   x  D           subscript       Œ±   k       subscript  a  Œ±   x   superscript  D  Œ±        P=p(x,D)=\sum_{|\alpha|\leq k}a_{\alpha}(x)D^{\alpha}.   The total symbol of P is the polynomial p :         œÉ  P    (  Œæ  )    =   p   (  x  ,  Œæ  )    =    ‚àë    |  Œ±  |   ‚â§  k      a  Œ±    (  x  )    Œæ  Œ±      .           subscript  œÉ  P   Œæ     p   x  Œæ           subscript       Œ±   k       subscript  a  Œ±   x   superscript  Œæ  Œ±        \sigma_{P}(\xi)=p(x,\xi)=\sum_{|\alpha|\leq k}a_{\alpha}(x)\xi^{\alpha}.     The leading symbol , also known as the principal symbol , is the highest degree component of œÉ P :        œÉ  P    (  Œæ  )    =    ‚àë    |  Œ±  |   =  k      a  Œ±    Œæ  Œ±            subscript  œÉ  P   Œæ     subscript       Œ±   k       subscript  a  Œ±    superscript  Œæ  Œ±       \sigma_{P}(\xi)=\sum_{|\alpha|=k}a_{\alpha}\xi^{\alpha}     and is of importance later because it is the only part of the symbol that transforms as a tensor under changes to the coordinate system.  The symbol of P appears naturally in connection with the Fourier transform as follows. Let ∆í be a Schwartz function . Then by the inverse Fourier transform,        P  f   (  x  )    =    1   2  œÄ      ‚à´   ùêë  d      e    i  x   ‚ãÖ  Œæ    p   (  x  ,   i  Œæ   )    f  ^    (  Œæ  )   d  Œæ      .        P  f  x       1    2  œÄ      subscript    superscript  ùêë  d       superscript  e   normal-‚ãÖ    i  x   Œæ    p   x    i  Œæ     normal-^  f   Œæ  d  Œæ       Pf(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\mathbf{R}^{d}}e^{ix\cdot\xi}p(x,i\xi)\hat{f}(\xi)\,%
 d\xi.     This exhibits P as a Fourier multiplier . A more general class of functions p ( x ,Œæ) which satisfy at most polynomial growth conditions in Œæ under which this integral is well-behaved comprises the pseudo-differential operators .  Vector bundles  Let E and F be vector bundles over a closed manifold  X , and suppose      P  :     C  ‚àû    (  E  )    ‚Üí    C  ‚àû    (  F  )        normal-:  P   normal-‚Üí     superscript  C    E      superscript  C    F      P:C^{\infty}(E)\to C^{\infty}(F)     is a differential operator of order   k   k   k   . In local coordinates on X , we have       P  u   (  x  )    =     ‚àë    |  Œ±  |   =  k      P  Œ±    (  x  )      ‚àÇ  Œ±   u    ‚àÇ   x  Œ±       +  lower order terms         P  u  x       subscript       Œ±   k       superscript  P  Œ±   x      superscript   Œ±   u      superscript  x  Œ±       lower order terms     Pu(x)=\sum_{|\alpha|=k}P^{\alpha}(x)\frac{\partial^{\alpha}u}{\partial x^{%
 \alpha}}+\text{lower order terms}     where, for each multi-index Œ±,      P  Œ±    (  x  )    :   E  ‚Üí  F      normal-:     superscript  P  Œ±   x    normal-‚Üí  E  F     P^{\alpha}(x):E\to F   is a bundle map , symmetric on the indices Œ±.  The k th order coefficients of P transform as a symmetric tensor       œÉ  P   :      S  k    (    T  *   X   )    ‚äó  E   ‚Üí  F      normal-:   subscript  œÉ  P    normal-‚Üí   tensor-product     superscript  S  k      superscript  T    X    E   F     \sigma_{P}:S^{k}(T^{*}X)\otimes E\to F     from the tensor product of the k th  symmetric power of the cotangent bundle of X with E to F . This symmetric tensor is known as the principal symbol (or just the symbol ) of P .  The coordinate system x i permits a local trivialization of the cotangent bundle by the coordinate differentials d x i , which determine fiber coordinates Œæ i . In terms of a basis of frames e Œº , f ŒΩ of E and F , respectively, the differential operator P decomposes into components        (   P  u   )   ŒΩ   =    ‚àë  Œº     P   ŒΩ  Œº     u  Œº          subscript    P  u   ŒΩ     subscript   Œº      subscript  P    ŒΩ  Œº     subscript  u  Œº       (Pu)_{\nu}=\sum_{\mu}P_{\nu\mu}u_{\mu}     on each section u of E . Here P ŒΩŒº is the scalar differential operator defined by        P   ŒΩ  Œº    =    ‚àë  Œ±     P   ŒΩ  Œº   Œ±    ‚àÇ   ‚àÇ   x  Œ±        .       subscript  P    ŒΩ  Œº      subscript   Œ±      superscript   subscript  P    ŒΩ  Œº    Œ±         superscript  x  Œ±         P_{\nu\mu}=\sum_{\alpha}P_{\nu\mu}^{\alpha}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\alpha}}.     With this trivialization, the principal symbol can now be written         (    œÉ  P    (  Œæ  )   u   )   ŒΩ   =    ‚àë    |  Œ±  |   =  k      ‚àë  Œº     P   ŒΩ  Œº   Œ±    (  x  )    Œæ  Œ±    u  Œº       .       subscript     subscript  œÉ  P   Œæ  u   ŒΩ     subscript       Œ±   k      subscript   Œº      superscript   subscript  P    ŒΩ  Œº    Œ±   x   subscript  Œæ  Œ±    superscript  u  Œº        (\sigma_{P}(\xi)u)_{\nu}=\sum_{|\alpha|=k}\sum_{\mu}P_{\nu\mu}^{\alpha}(x)\xi_%
 {\alpha}u^{\mu}.     In the cotangent space over a fixed point x of X , the symbol    œÉ  P     subscript  œÉ  P    \sigma_{P}   defines a homogeneous polynomial of degree k in     T  x  *   X       subscript   superscript  T    x   X    T^{*}_{x}X   with values in    Hom   (   E  x   ,   F  x   )      Hom   subscript  E  x    subscript  F  x     \operatorname{Hom}(E_{x},F_{x})   .  The differential operator   P   P   P   is elliptic if its symbol is invertible; that is for each nonzero    Œ∏  ‚àà    T  *   X       Œ∏     superscript  T    X     \theta\in T^{*}X   the bundle map     œÉ  P    (  Œ∏  ,  ‚Ä¶  ,  Œ∏  )        subscript  œÉ  P    Œ∏  normal-‚Ä¶  Œ∏     \sigma_{P}(\theta,\dots,\theta)   is invertible. On a compact manifold , it follows from the elliptic theory that P is a Fredholm operator : it has finite-dimensional kernel and cokernel.
