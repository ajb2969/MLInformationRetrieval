Anton-Schmidt equation of state

The Anton-Schmidt equation is an empirical equation of state for crystalline solids, e.g. for pure metals or intermetallic compounds.1 Quantum mechanical investigations of intermetallic compounds show that the dependency of the pressure under isotropic deformation can be described empirically by


 
 .
Integration of 
 
 
 
  leads to equation of the state for the total energy. The energy 
 
 
 
  required to compress a solid to volume 
 
 
 
  is


 
  which gives


 
 .
The fitting parameters 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are related to material properties, where


 
  is the bulk modulus

 
  at equilibrium volume 
 
 
 
 .


 
  correlates with the Grüneisen parameter

 
 .23
However, the fitting parameter 
 
 
 
  does not reproduce the total energy of the free atoms.4
The total energy equation is used to determine elastic and thermal material constants in quantum chemical simulation packages.56
