   Erdős–Burr conjecture      Erdős–Burr conjecture   In mathematics , the Erdős–Burr conjecture is a problem concerning the Ramsey number of sparse graphs . The conjecture is named after Paul Erdős and Stefan Burr , and is one of many conjectures named after Erdős ; it states that the Ramsey number of graphs in any sparse family of graphs should grow linearly in the number of vertices of the graph.  In 2015, a proof of the conjecture was announced by Choongbum Lee. 1  Definitions  If G is an undirected graph , then the degeneracy of G is the minimum number p such that every subgraph of G contains a vertex of degree p or smaller. A graph with degeneracy p is called p -degenerate. Equivalently, a p -degenerate graph is a graph that can be reduced to the empty graph by repeatedly removing a vertex of degree p or smaller.  It follows from Ramsey's theorem that for any graph G there exists a least integer    r   (  G  )       r  G    r(G)   , the Ramsey number of G , such that any complete graph on at least    r   (  G  )       r  G    r(G)    vertices whose edges are coloured red or blue contains a monochromatic copy of G . For instance, the Ramsey number of a triangle is 6: no matter how the edges of a complete graph on six vertices are colored red or blue, there is always either a red triangle or a blue triangle.  The conjecture  In 1973, Paul Erdős and Stefan Burr made the following conjecture:   For every integer p there exists a constant c p so that any p -degenerate graph G on n vertices has Ramsey number at most c p n .   That is, if an n -vertex graph G is p -degenerate, then a monochromatic copy of G should exist in every two-edge-colored complete graph on c p n vertices.  Known results  Although a proof of full conjecture has not been published, it has been settled in some special cases. It was proven for bounded-degree graphs by ; their proof led to a very high value of c p , and improvements to this constant were made by  and . More generally, the conjecture is known to be true for p -arrangeable graphs, which includes graphs with bounded maximum degree, planar graphs and graphs that do not contain a subdivision of K p . 2 It is also known for subdivided graphs, graphs in which no two adjacent vertices have degree greater than two. 3  For arbitrary graphs, the Ramsey number is known to be bounded by a function that grows only slightly superlinearly. Specifically,  showed that there exists a constant c p such that, for any p -degenerate n -vertex graph G ,        r   (  G  )    ≤    2    c  p     log  n      n    .        r  G      superscript  2     subscript  c  p       n      n     r(G)\leq 2^{c_{p}\sqrt{\log n}}n.
