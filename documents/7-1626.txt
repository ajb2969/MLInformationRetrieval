   Initial volume of distribution      Initial volume of distribution   The initial volume of distribution is a pharmacological term used to quantify the distribution of a drug throughout the body relatively soon after oral or intravenous dosing of a drug and prior to the drug reaching a steady state equilibrium. Following distribution of the drug, measurement of blood levels indicate the apparent volume of distribution . Calculation of the initial volume of distribution is the same calculation as that for the apparent volume of distribution, given by the equation:         V  D   =     total    amount    of    drug    in    the    body    per    body    weight    unit    (  Kg  )    (  i  .  e  .

 weight\ unit\ (Kg)\ (i.e.Dose)}}{\mathrm{drug\ blood\ concentration}}        Therefore the dose required to give a certain plasma concentration can be determined if the V D for that drug is known. The V D is not a real volume; it is more a reflection of how a drug will distribute throughout the body depending on several physicochemical properties, e.g. solubility, charge, size, etc. The V D may also be used to determine how readily a drug will displace into the body tissue compartments relative to the blood:         V  D   =    V  P   +    V  T    (    f  u    f   u  t     )          subscript  V  D      subscript  V  P      subscript  V  T       f  u     f   subscript  u  t         {V_{D}}={V_{P}}+{V_{T}}\left(\frac{fu}{fu_{t}}\right)        Where:  V P = plasma volume  V T = apparent tissue volume  fu = fraction unbound in plasma  fu T = fraction unbound in tissue  th:ปริมาตรกระจายตัว "  Category:Pharmacokinetics
