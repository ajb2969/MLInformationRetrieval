   Twist knot      Twist knot   In knot theory , a branch of mathematics , a twist knot is a knot obtained by repeatedly twisting a closed loop and then linking the ends together. (That is, a twist knot is any Whitehead double of an unknot.) The twist knots are an infinite family of knots, and are considered the simplest type of knots after the torus knots .  Construction  A twist knot is obtained by linking together the two ends of a twisted loop. Any number of half-twists may be introduced into the loop before linking, resulting in an infinite family of possibilities. The following figures show the first few twist knots:  Image:One-Twist Trefoil.png|One half-twist ( trefoil knot ) Image:Blue Figure-Eight Knot.png|Two half-twists ( figure-eight knot ) Image:Blue Three-Twist Knot.png|Three half-twists ( 5 2 knot ) Image:Blue Stevedore Knot.png|Four half-twists ( stevedore knot ) Image:Blue 7_2 Knot.png|Five half-twists (7 2 knot) Image:Blue 8_1 Knot.png|Six half-twists (8 1 knot)  Properties  (Figure)  The four half-twist stevedore knot is created by passing the one end of an unknot with four half-twists through the other.   All twist knots have unknotting number one, since the knot can be untied by unlinking the two ends. Every twist knot is also a 2-bridge knot . 1 Of the twist knots, only the unknot and the stevedore knot are slice knots . 2 A twist knot with   n   n   n   half-twists has crossing number     n  +  2      n  2    n+2   . All twist knots are invertible , but the only amphichiral twist knots are the unknot and the figure-eight knot .  Invariants  The invariants of a twist knot depend on the number   n   n   n   of half-twists. The Alexander polynomial of a twist knot is given by the formula       Δ   (  t  )    =   {           n  +  1   2    t   -  n   +      n  +  1   2     t   -  1         if  n  is odd          -     n  2    t    +   (   n  +  1   )    -     n  2     t   -  1         if  n  is even,             normal-Δ  t    cases            n  1   2   t   n         n  1   2    superscript  t    1        if  n  is odd             n  2   t      n  1        n  2    superscript  t    1        if  n  is even,      \Delta(t)=\begin{cases}\frac{n+1}{2}t-n+\frac{n+1}{2}t^{-1}&\text{if }n\text{ %
 is odd}\\
 -\frac{n}{2}t+(n+1)-\frac{n}{2}t^{-1}&\text{if }n\text{ is even,}\\
 \end{cases}     and the Conway polynomial is       ∇   (  z  )    =   {          n  +  1   2     z  2    +  1      if  n  is odd        1  -     n  2     z  2        if  n  is even.            normal-∇  z    cases          n  1   2    superscript  z  2    1     if  n  is odd     1      n  2    superscript  z  2       if  n  is even.      \nabla(z)=\begin{cases}\frac{n+1}{2}z^{2}+1&\text{if }n\text{ is odd}\\
 1-\frac{n}{2}z^{2}&\text{if }n\text{ is even.}\\
 \end{cases}     When   n   n   n   is odd, the Jones polynomial is        V   (  q  )    =     1  +   q   -  2    +   q   -  n     -   q    -  n   -  3      q  +  1     ,        V  q         1   superscript  q    2     superscript  q    n      superscript  q      n   3       q  1      V(q)=\frac{1+q^{-2}+q^{-n}-q^{-n-3}}{q+1},     and when   n   n   n   is even, it is        V   (  q  )    =       q  3   +  q   -   q   3  -  n     +   q   -  n      q  +  1     .
