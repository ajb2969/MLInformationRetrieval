   15 Arietis      15 Arietis   15 Arietis is the Flamsteed designation for a single 1  star in the northern constellation of Aries . It has an apparent visual magnitude of 5.74, 2 which is just bright enough to be visible to the naked eye from dark suburban skies . An annual parallax shift of 5.84 mas 3 corresponds to a physical distance of approximately  from Earth. At that distance, the star's brightness is reduced by 0.33 4 in magnitude because of extinction from interstellar gas and dust .  This is a red giant star with a stellar classification of M3 III. 5 The measured angular diameter of this star is . 6 At the estimated distance of Delta Ophiuchi, 7 this yields a physical size of about 67 times the radius of the Sun . 8 It is a pulsating variable star with the variable star designation AV Arietis. The first pulsation period is 18.1 days with an amplitude of 0.028 magnitudes, while the second is 21.9 days and 0.030 in magnitude. 9  References  {0.0046491\ \text{AU}/R_{\bigodot}} \\  & \approx 134\cdot R_{\bigodot}  \end{align} 10  }}  External links   HR 631  [ http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinPreview?-c=02+10+37.6%2B19+30+01&ident; ;=V*+AV+Ari&submit;=Aladin+previewer Image 15 Arietis]   "  013325  010155  Arietis, 15  Category:Aries (constellation)  Category:M-type main-sequence stars              ↩
