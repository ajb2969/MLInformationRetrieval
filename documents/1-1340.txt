   Power-law index profile      Power-law index profile   For optical fibers , a power-law index profile is an index of refraction profile characterized by       n   (  r  )    =   {       n  1     1  -   2  Δ    (    r  α    )   g          r  ≤  α         n  1     1  -   2  Δ         r  ≥  α             n  r    cases     subscript  n  1       1    2  normal-Δ   superscript    r  α   g         r  α      subscript  n  1       1    2  normal-Δ        r  α      n(r)=\begin{cases}n_{1}\sqrt{1-2\Delta\left({r\over\alpha}\right)^{g}}&r\leq%
 \alpha\\
 n_{1}\sqrt{1-2\Delta}&r\geq\alpha\end{cases}   where     Δ  =     n  1  2   -   n  2  2     2   n  1  2      ,      normal-Δ       superscript   subscript  n  1   2    superscript   subscript  n  2   2      2   superscript   subscript  n  1   2       \Delta={n_{1}^{2}-n_{2}^{2}\over 2n_{1}^{2}},     and    n   (  r  )       n  r    n(r)   is the nominal refractive index as a function of distance from the fiber axis ,    n  1     subscript  n  1    n_{1}   is the nominal refractive index on axis,    n  2     subscript  n  2    n_{2}   is the refractive index of the cladding , which is taken to be homogeneous (     n   (  r  )    =     n  2     for   r   ≥  α          n  r      subscript  n  2   for  r        α     n(r)=n_{2}\mathrm{\ for\ }r\geq\alpha   ),   α   α   \alpha   is the core radius, and   g   g   g   is a parameter that defines the shape of the profile.   α   α   \alpha   is often used in place of   g   g   g   . Hence, this is sometimes called an alpha profile .  For this class of profiles, multimode distortion is smallest when   g   g   g   takes a particular value depending on the material used. For most materials, this optimum value is approximately 2. In the limit of infinite   g   g   g   , the profile becomes a step-index profile .
