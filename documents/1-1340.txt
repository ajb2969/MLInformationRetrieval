Power-law index profile

For optical fibers, a power-law index profile is an index of refraction profile characterized by


 
  where 
 
 

and 
 
 
 
  is the nominal refractive index as a function of distance from the fiber axis, 
 
 
 
  is the nominal refractive index on axis, 
 
 
 
  is the refractive index of the cladding, which is taken to be homogeneous (
 
 
 
 ), 
 
 
 
  is the core radius, and 
 
 
 
  is a parameter that defines the shape of the profile. 
 
 
 
  is often used in place of 
 
 
 
 . Hence, this is sometimes called an alpha profile.
For this class of profiles, multimode distortion is smallest when 
 
 
 
  takes a particular value depending on the material used. For most materials, this optimum value is approximately 2. In the limit of infinite 
 
 
 
 , the profile becomes a step-index profile.
