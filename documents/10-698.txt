3-oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase




3-oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase

In enzymology, a 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + NADP+

 
  3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + NADPH + H+

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein], NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]:NADP+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include beta-ketoacyl-[acyl-carrier protein](ACP) reductase, beta-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase, beta-ketoacyl reductase, beta-ketoacyl thioester reductase, beta-ketoacyl-ACP reductase, beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, 3-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein reductase, 3-ketoacyl ACP reductase, NADPH-specific 3-oxoacyl-[acylcarrier protein]reductase, and 3-oxoacyl-[ACP]reductase. This enzyme participates in fatty acid biosynthesis and polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis.
