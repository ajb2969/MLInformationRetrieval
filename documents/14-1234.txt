   Parity progression ratios      Parity progression ratios   A parity progression ratios (PPR) is a measure commonly used in demography to study fertility . The PPR is simply the proportion of women with a certain number of children who go onto have another child. Calculating the PPR, also known as    a  x     subscript  a  x    a_{x}   , can be achieved by using the following formula :       a  x   =    (women with at least  x   +     1  children ever borne)   /  (women with at least   x  children ever born)         subscript  a  x       (women with at least  x         1  children ever borne)   (women with at least   x  children ever born)      a_{x}=\text{(women with at least }x+1\text{ children ever borne) }/\text{ (%
 women with at least }x\text{ children ever born)}    1  In more developed countries where two child families are seen as the norm    a  2     subscript  a  2    a_{2}   (or the proportion of women with two children who go on to have a third) is of critical importance in determining overall fertility levels.      a  0     subscript  a  0    a_{0}   is simply the proportion of women who become mothers.
