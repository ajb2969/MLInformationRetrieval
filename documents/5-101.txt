   PCF theory      PCF theory   PCF theory is the name of a mathematical theory, introduced by Saharon , that deals with the cofinality of the ultraproducts of ordered sets . It gives strong upper bounds on the cardinalities of power sets of singular  cardinals , and has many more applications as well. The abbreviation "PCF" stands for "possible cofinalities ".  Main definitions  If A is an infinite set of regular cardinals , D is an ultrafilter on A , then we let    c  f   (   ∏   A  /  D    )       c  f   product    A  D      cf(\prod A/D)   denote the cofinality of the ordered set of functions    ∏  A     product  A    \prod A   where the ordering is defined as follows.    A  ⊆   pcf   (  A  )        A    pcf  A     A\subseteq{\rm pcf}(A)     Main results  Obviously, pcf( A ) consists of regular cardinals. Considering ultrafilters concentrated on elements of A , we get that     |  A  |   <   min   (  A  )          A     A     |A|<\min(A)   . Shelah proved, that if    {   B  θ   :   θ  ∈   pcf   (  A  )     }     conditional-set   subscript  B  θ     θ    pcf  A      \{B_{\theta}:\theta\in{\rm pcf}(A)\}   , then pcf( A ) has a largest element, and there are subsets    c  f   (   ∏   A  /  D    )       c  f   product    A  D      cf(\prod A/D)   of A such that for each ultrafilter D on A ,     B  θ   ∈  D       subscript  B  θ   D    B_{\theta}\in D   is the least element θ of pcf( A ) such that     |   pcf   (  A  )    |   ≤   2   |  A  |            pcf  A     superscript  2    A      |{\rm pcf}(A)|\leq 2^{|A|}   . Consequently,     2   ℵ  ω    <   ℵ   ω  4         superscript  2   subscript  normal-ℵ  ω     subscript  normal-ℵ   subscript  ω  4      2^{\aleph_{\omega}}<\aleph_{\omega_{4}}   . Shelah also proved that if A is an interval of regular cardinals (i.e., A is the set of all regular cardinals between two cardinals), then pcf( A ) is also an interval of regular cardinals and |pcf( A )|+4. This implies the famous inequality        c  f   (   ∏   A  /  D    )    <  λ        c  f   product    A  D     λ    cf(\prod A/D)<\lambda      assuming that ℵ ω is strong limit .  If λ is an infinite cardinal, then J <λ is the following ideal on A . B ∈ J <λ if    {   B  θ   :    θ  ∈   pcf   (  A  )     ,   θ  <  λ    }     conditional-set   subscript  B  θ    formulae-sequence    θ    pcf  A      θ  λ      \{B_{\theta}:\theta\in{\rm pcf}(A),\theta<\lambda\}   holds for every ultrafilter D with B ∈ D . Then J <λ is the ideal generated by the sets    ∏   B  λ      product   subscript  B  λ     \prod B_{\lambda}   . There exist scales , i.e., for every λ∈pcf( A ) there is a sequence of length λ of elements of    ∏  A     product  A    \prod A   which is both increasing and cofinal mod J <λ . This implies that the cofinality of     2   ℵ  ω    <   ℵ   ω  1         superscript  2   subscript  normal-ℵ  ω     subscript  normal-ℵ   subscript  ω  1      2^{\aleph_{\omega}}<\aleph_{\omega_{1}}   under pointwise dominance is max(pcf( A )). Another consequence is that if λ is singular and no regular cardinal less than λ is Jónsson , then also λ + is not Jónsson. In particular, there is a Jónsson algebra on ℵ ω+1 , which settles an old conjecture.  Unsolved problems  The most notorious conjecture in pcf theory states that |pcf( A )|=| A | holds for every set A of regular cardinals with | A | a ). if="" imply="" that="" this="" would="" ℵ ω  is strong limit, then the sharp bound        2   ℵ   ω  1     <   ℵ   ω  2         superscript  2   subscript  normal-ℵ   subscript  ω  1      subscript  normal-ℵ   subscript  ω  2      2^{\aleph_{\omega_{1}}}<\aleph_{\omega_{2}}      holds. The analogous bound   $2^{\aleph_{\omega_1}}<\aleph_{\omega_2}$   follows from Chang's conjecture ( Magidor ) or even from the nonexistence of a Kurepa tree ( Shelah ).
