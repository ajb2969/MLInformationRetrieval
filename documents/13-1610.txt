   Margules activity model      Margules activity model   The Margules activity model is a simple thermodynamic model for the excess Gibbs free energy of a liquid mixture introduced in 1895 by Max Margules . 1 2 After Lewis had introduced the concept of the activity coefficient , the model could be used to derive an expression for the activity coefficients    γ  i     subscript  γ  i    \gamma_{i}   of a compound i in a liquid, a measure for the deviation from ideal solubility, also known as Raoult's law .  In chemical engineering the Margules Gibbs free energy model for liquid mixtures is better known as the Margules activity or activity coefficient model. Although the model is old it has the characteristic feature to describe extrema in the activity coefficient, which modern models like UNIQUAC , NRTL and Wilson cannot.  Equations  Excess Gibbs free energy  Margules expressed the excess Gibbs free energy of a binary liquid mixture as a power series of the mole fractions x i :        G   e  x     R  T    =     X  1    X  2    (     A  21    X  1    +    A  12    X  2     )    +    X  1  2    X  2  2    (     B  21    X  1    +    B  12    X  2     )    +  …  +    X  1  m    X  2  m    (     M  21    X  1    +    M  12    X  2     )            superscript  G    e  x      R  T         subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2        subscript  A  21    subscript  X  1       subscript  A  12    subscript  X  2         superscript   subscript  X  1   2    superscript   subscript  X  2   2        subscript  B  21    subscript  X  1       subscript  B  12    subscript  X  2      normal-…     superscript   subscript  X  1   m    superscript   subscript  X  2   m        subscript  M  21    subscript  X  1       subscript  M  12    subscript  X  2         \frac{G^{ex}}{RT}=X_{1}X_{2}(A_{21}X_{1}+A_{12}X_{2})+X_{1}^{2}X_{2}^{2}(B_{21%
 }X_{1}+B_{12}X_{2})+...+X_{1}^{m}X_{2}^{m}(M_{21}X_{1}+M_{12}X_{2})     In here the A, B are constants, which are derived from regressing experimental phase equilibria data. Frequently the B and higher order parameters are set to zero. The leading term     X  1    X  2        subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2     X_{1}X_{2}   assures that the excess Gibbs energy becomes zero at x 1 =0 and x 1 =1.  Activity coefficient  The activity coefficient of component i is found by differentiation of the excess Gibbs energy towards x i . This yields, when applied only to the first term and using the Gibbs–Duhem equation ,: 3     {        ln    γ  1    =    [    A  12   +   2   (    A  21   -   A  12    )    x  1     ]    x  2  2            ln    γ  2    =    [    A  21   +   2   (    A  12   -   A  21    )    x  2     ]    x  1  2           fragments  normal-{         subscript  γ  1       delimited-[]     subscript  A  12     2     subscript  A  21    subscript  A  12     subscript  x  1       subscript   superscript  x  2   2            subscript  γ  2       delimited-[]     subscript  A  21     2     subscript  A  12    subscript  A  21     subscript  x  2       subscript   superscript  x  2   1         \left\{\begin{matrix}\ln\ \gamma_{1}=[A_{12}+2(A_{21}-A_{12})x_{1}]x^{2}_{2}\\
 \ln\ \gamma_{2}=[A_{21}+2(A_{12}-A_{21})x_{2}]x^{2}_{1}\end{matrix}\right.     In here A 12 and A 21 are constants which are equal to the logarithm of the limiting activity coefficients     ln    (   γ  1  ∞   )        superscript   subscript  γ  1       \ln\ (\gamma_{1}^{\infty})   and     ln    (   γ  2  ∞   )        superscript   subscript  γ  2       \ln\ (\gamma_{2}^{\infty})   respectively.  When     A  12   =   A  21   =  A         subscript  A  12    subscript  A  21        A     A_{12}=A_{21}=A   , which implies molecules of same molecular size but different polarity, the equations reduce to the one-parameter Margules activity model:      {        ln    γ  1    =   A   x  2  2            ln    γ  2    =   A   x  1  2           fragments  normal-{         subscript  γ  1      A   subscript   superscript  x  2   2            subscript  γ  2      A   subscript   superscript  x  2   1         \left\{\begin{matrix}\ln\ \gamma_{1}=Ax^{2}_{2}\\
 \ln\ \gamma_{2}=Ax^{2}_{1}\end{matrix}\right.     In that case the activity coefficients cross at x 1 =0.5 and the limiting activity coefficients are equal. When A=0 the model reduces to the ideal solution, i.e. the activity of a compound is equal to its concentration (mole fraction).  Extrema  Using simple algebraic manipulation, can be stated that      d  l  n   γ  1    /  d    x  1           d  l  n   subscript  γ  1    d    subscript  x  1     dln\gamma_{1}/dx_{1}   increases or decreases monotonically within all    x  1     subscript  x  1    x_{1}   range, if     A  12   <  0       subscript  A  12   0    A_{12}<0   or     A  21   >  0       subscript  A  21   0    A_{21}>0   with    0.5  <    A  12   /   A  21    <  2        0.5     subscript  A  12    subscript  A  21         2     0.5   , respectively. When     A  12   <    A  21   /  2        subscript  A  12      subscript  A  21   2     A_{12}   and     A  12   <  0       subscript  A  12   0    A_{12}<0   , the activity coefficient curve of component 1 shows a maximum and compound 2 minimum at:       x  1   =    1  -    2   A  12    /   A  21      3   (   1  -    A  12   /   A  21     )          subscript  x  1       1      2   subscript  A  12     subscript  A  21       3    1     subscript  A  12    subscript  A  21         x_{1}=\frac{1-2A_{12}/A_{21}}{3(1-A_{12}/A_{21})}     Same expression can be used when     A  12   <    A  21   /  2        subscript  A  12      subscript  A  21   2     A_{12}   and     A  12   >  0       subscript  A  12   0    A_{12}>0   , but in this situation the activity coefficient curve of component 1 shows a minimum and compound 2 a maximum. It is easily seen that when A 12 =0 and A 21 >0 that a maximum in the activity coefficient of compound 1 exists at x 1 =1/3. Obvious, the activity coefficient of compound 2 goes at this concentration through a minimum as a result of the Gibbs-Duhem rule .  The binary system Chloroform(1)-Methanol(2) is an example of a system that shows a maximum in the activity coefficient of Chloroform. The parameters for a description at 20 °C are A 12 =0.6298 and A 21 =1.9522. This gives a minimum in the activity of Chloroform at x 1 =0.17.  In general, for the case A=A 12 =A 21 , the larger parameter A, the more the binary systems deviates from Raoult's law; i.e. ideal solubility. When A>2 the system starts to demix in two liquids at 50/50 composition; i.e. plait point is at 50 mol%. Since:      A  =   ln   γ  1  ∞    =   ln   γ  2  ∞          A     superscript   subscript  γ  1              superscript   subscript  γ  2         A=\ln\gamma_{1}^{\infty}=\ln\gamma_{2}^{\infty}        γ  1  ∞   =   γ  2  ∞   >   exp   (  2  )    ≈  7.38         superscript   subscript  γ  1      superscript   subscript  γ  2            2        7.38     \gamma_{1}^{\infty}=\gamma_{2}^{\infty}>\exp(2)\approx 7.38     For asymmetric binary systems, A 12 ≠A 21 , the liquid-liquid separation always occurs for   4          A  21   +   A  12    >  4         subscript  A  21    subscript  A  12    4    A_{21}+A_{12}>4     Or equivalently:        γ  1  ∞    γ  2  ∞    >   exp   (  4  )    ≈  54.6           superscript   subscript  γ  1      superscript   subscript  γ  2        4        54.6     \gamma_{1}^{\infty}\gamma_{2}^{\infty}>\exp(4)\approx 54.6     The plait point is not located at 50 mol%. It depends on the ratio of the limiting activity coefficients.
