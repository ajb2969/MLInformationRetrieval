   Analytic torsion      Analytic torsion   In mathematics, Reidemeister torsion (or R-torsion , or Reidemeister–Franz torsion ) is a topological invariant of manifolds introduced by Kurt Reidemeister () for 3-manifolds and generalized to higher dimensions by  and . Analytic torsion (or Ray–Singer torsion ) is an invariant of Riemannian manifolds defined by  as an analytic analogue of Reidemeister torsion.  and  proved Ray and Singer's conjecture that Reidemeister torsion and analytic torsion are the same for compact Riemannian manifolds.  Reidemeister torsion was the first invariant in algebraic topology that could distinguish between spaces which are homotopy equivalent but not homeomorphic , and can thus be seen as the birth of geometric topology as a distinct field. It can be used to classify lens spaces .  Reidemeister torsion is closely related to Whitehead torsion ; see . For later work on torsion see the books , . And it had given one of important motivation to arithmetic topology .  Definition of analytic torsion  If M is a Riemannian manifold and E a vector bundle over M , then there is a Laplacian operator acting on the i -forms with values in E . If the eigenvalues on i -forms are λ j then the zeta function ζ i is defined to be        ζ  i    (  s  )    =    ∑    λ  j   >  0     λ  j   -  s            subscript  ζ  i   s     subscript      subscript  λ  j   0     superscript   subscript  λ  j     s       \zeta_{i}(s)=\sum_{\lambda_{j}>0}\lambda_{j}^{-s}     for s large, and this is extended to all complex s by analytic continuation . The zeta regularized determinant of the Laplacian acting on i -forms is       Δ  i   =   exp   (   -    ζ  i  ′    (  0  )     )         subscript  normal-Δ  i          subscript   superscript  ζ  normal-′   i   0       \Delta_{i}=\exp(-\zeta^{\prime}_{i}(0))     which is formally the product of the positive eigenvalues of the laplacian acting on i -forms. The analytic torsion  T ( M , E ) is defined to be        T   (  M  ,  E  )    =   exp   (    ∑  i       (   -  1   )   i   i   ζ  i  ′    (  0  )    /  2    )    =    ∏  i    Δ  i   -      (   -  1   )   i   i   /  2       .

Definition of Reidemeister torsion  Let   X   X   X   be a finite connected CW-complex with fundamental group     π  :=    π  1    (  X  )       assign  π     subscript  π  1   X     \pi:=\pi_{1}(X)   and universal cover     X  ~     normal-~  X    {\tilde{X}}   , and let   U   U   U   be an orthogonal finite-dimensional   π   π   \pi   -representation. Suppose that        H  n  π    (  X  ;  U  )    :=    H  n    (    U   ⊗   𝐙   [  π  ]      C  *     (   X  ~   )    )    =  0       assign     subscript   superscript  H  π   n    X  U       subscript  H  n       subscript  tensor-product    𝐙   delimited-[]  π     U   subscript  C      normal-~  X          0     H^{\pi}_{n}(X;U):=H_{n}(U\otimes_{\mathbf{Z}[\pi]}C_{*}({\tilde{X}}))=0     for all n. If we fix a cellular basis for     C  *    (   X  ~   )        subscript  C     normal-~  X     C_{*}({\tilde{X}})   and an orthogonal   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   -basis for   U   U   U   , then     D  *   :=    U   ⊗   𝐙   [  π  ]      C  *     (   X  ~   )       assign   subscript  D        subscript  tensor-product    𝐙   delimited-[]  π     U   subscript  C      normal-~  X      D_{*}:=U\otimes_{\mathbf{Z}[\pi]}C_{*}({\tilde{X}})   is a contractible finite based free   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   -chain complex. Let     γ  *   :    D  *   →   D    *   +  1         normal-:   subscript  γ     normal-→   subscript  D     subscript  D    absent    1        \gamma_{*}:D_{*}\to D_{*+1}   be any chain contraction of D * , i.e.       d   n  +  1    ∘   γ  n    +    γ   n  -  1    ∘   d  n     =   i   d   D  n              subscript  d    n  1     subscript  γ  n       subscript  γ    n  1     subscript  d  n       i   subscript  d   subscript  D  n       d_{n+1}\circ\gamma_{n}+\gamma_{n-1}\circ d_{n}=id_{D_{n}}   for all n. We obtain an isomorphism      (    d  *   +   γ  *    )    o  d  d    :    D   o  d  d    →   D   e  v  e  n        normal-:   subscript     subscript  d     subscript  γ       o  d  d     normal-→   subscript  D    o  d  d     subscript  D    e  v  e  n       (d_{*}+\gamma_{*})_{odd}:D_{odd}\to D_{even}   with     D   o  d  d    :=     ⊕    n   o  d  d      D  n       assign   subscript  D    o  d  d      subscript  direct-sum    n  o  d  d     subscript  D  n      D_{odd}:=\oplus_{n\,odd}\,D_{n}   ,     D   e  v  e  n    :=     ⊕    n   e  v  e  n      D  n       assign   subscript  D    e  v  e  n      subscript  direct-sum    n  e  v  e  n     subscript  D  n      D_{even}:=\oplus_{n\,even}\,D_{n}   . We define the Reidemeister torsion       ρ   (  X  ;  U  )    :=    |    d  e  t    (  A  )    |    -  1    ∈   𝐑    >  0         assign    ρ   X  U     superscript       d  e  t   A      1          superscript  𝐑    absent  0       \rho(X;U):=|\mathop{det}(A)|^{-1}\in\mathbf{R}^{>0}     where A is the matrix of     (    d  *   +   γ  *    )    o  d  d      subscript     subscript  d     subscript  γ       o  d  d     (d_{*}+\gamma_{*})_{odd}   with respect to the given bases. The Reidemeister torsion    ρ   (  X  ;  U  )       ρ   X  U     \rho(X;U)   is independent of the choice of the cellular basis for     C  *    (   X  ~   )        subscript  C     normal-~  X     C_{*}({\tilde{X}})   , the orthogonal basis for   U   U   U   and the chain contraction    γ  *     subscript  γ     \gamma_{*}   .  Let   M   M   M   be a compact smooth manifold, and let    ρ  :    π   (  M  )    →   G  L   (  E  )        normal-:  ρ   normal-→    π  M     G  L  E      \rho:\pi(M)\rightarrow GL(E)   be a unimodular representation.   M   M   M   has a smooth triangulation. For any choice of a volume    μ  ∈    d  e  t     H  *    (  M  )         μ     d  e  t      subscript  H    M      \mu\in\mathop{det}H_{*}(M)   , we get an invariant     τ  M    (  ρ  :  μ  )   ∈   𝐑  +      fragments   subscript  τ  M    fragments  normal-(  ρ  normal-:  μ  normal-)     superscript  𝐑      \tau_{M}(\rho:\mu)\in\mathbf{R}^{+}   . Then we call the positive real number     τ  M    (  ρ  :  μ  )      fragments   subscript  τ  M    fragments  normal-(  ρ  normal-:  μ  normal-)     \tau_{M}(\rho:\mu)   the Reidemiester torsion of the manifold   M   M   M   respect to   ρ   ρ   \rho   and   μ   μ   \mu   .  A short history of Reidemeister torsion  Reidemeister torsion was first used to combinatorially classify 3-dimensional lens spaces in  by Reidemeister, and in higher-dimensional spaces by Franz. The classification includes examples of homotopy equivalent 3-dimensional manifolds which are not homeomorphic – at the time (1935) the classification was only up to PL homeomorphism , but later  showed that this was in fact a classification up to homeomorphism .  J. H. C. Whitehead defined the "torsion" of a homotopy equivalence between finite complexes. This is a direct generalization of the Reidemeister, Franz, and de Rham concept; but is a more delicate invariant. Whitehead torsion provides a key tool for the study of combinatorial or differentiable manifolds with nontrivial fundamental group and is closely related to the concept of "simple homotopy type." see  In 1960 Milnor discovered the duality relation of torsion invariants of manifolds and show that the (twisted) Alexander polynomial of knots is the Reidemister torsion of its knot complement in S 3 .  For each q the Poincaré duality     P  o     subscript  P  o    P_{o}   induces       P  o   :    det   (    H  q    (  M  )    )     ⟶  ∼     (   det   (    H   n  -  q     (  M  )    )    )    -  1        normal-:   subscript  P  o     superscript  normal-⟶  similar-to    det     subscript  H  q   M     superscript   det     subscript  H    n  q    M      1       P_{o}:\operatorname{det}(H_{q}(M))\stackrel{\sim}{\longrightarrow}(%
 \operatorname{det}(H_{n-q}(M)))^{-1}   and then we obtain        Δ   (  t  )    =   ±    t  n   Δ   (   1  /  t   )      .        normal-Δ  t    plus-or-minus     superscript  t  n   normal-Δ    1  t       \Delta(t)=\pm t^{n}\Delta(1/t).   The representation of the fundamental group of knot complement plays a central role in them. It gives the relation between knot theory and torsion invariants.  Cheeger–Müller theorem  Let    (  M  ,  g  )     M  g    (M,g)   be an orientable compact Riemann manifold of dimension n and    ρ  :    π   (  M  )    →    G  L    (  E  )        normal-:  ρ   normal-→    π  M      G  L   E      \rho:\pi(M)\rightarrow\mathop{GL}(E)   a representation of the fundamental group of   M   M   M   on a real vector space of dimension N. Then we can define the De Rham complex       Λ  0    ⟶   d  0     Λ  1    ⟶   d  1    ⋯   ⟶   d   n  -  1      Λ  n         superscript  normal-⟶   subscript  d  0     superscript  normal-Λ  0    superscript  normal-Λ  1      superscript  normal-⟶   subscript  d  1      normal-⋯     superscript  normal-⟶   subscript  d    n  1        superscript  normal-Λ  n      \Lambda^{0}\stackrel{d_{0}}{\longrightarrow}\Lambda^{1}\stackrel{d_{1}}{%
 \longrightarrow}\cdots\stackrel{d_{n-1}}{\longrightarrow}\Lambda^{n}   and the formal adjoint    d  p     subscript  d  p    d_{p}   and    δ  p     subscript  δ  p    \delta_{p}   due to the flatness of    E  q     subscript  E  q    E_{q}   . And we also obtain the Laplacian on p-form as usual        Δ  p   =     δ  p    d  p    +    d   p  -  1     δ   p  -  1       .       subscript  normal-Δ  p        subscript  δ  p    subscript  d  p       subscript  d    p  1     subscript  δ    p  1        \Delta_{p}=\delta_{p}d_{p}+d_{p-1}\delta_{p-1}.     We assume     ∂  M   =  0        M   0    \partial M=0   , then the Laplacian is a symmetric positive simipositive elliptic operator with pure point spectrum       0  ≤   λ  0   ≤   λ  1   ≤  ⋯  →  ∞   .        0   subscript  λ  0         subscript  λ  1        normal-⋯    normal-→        0\leq\lambda_{0}\leq\lambda_{1}\leq\cdots\rightarrow\infty.   As same as the above definition we can define the zeta function associated with the Laplacian    Δ  q     subscript  normal-Δ  q    \Delta_{q}   on     Λ  q    (  E  )        superscript  normal-Λ  q   E    \Lambda^{q}(E)   by         ζ  q    (  s  ;  ρ  )    =    ∑    λ  j   >  0     λ  j   -  s     =    1   Γ   (  s  )       ∫  0  ∞     t   s  -  1      T  r     (    e   -   t   Δ  q      -   P  q    )   d  t        ,     R  e    (  s  )    >   n  2       formulae-sequence         subscript  ζ  q    s  ρ      subscript      subscript  λ  j   0     superscript   subscript  λ  j     s              1    normal-Γ  s      subscript   superscript     0      superscript  t    s  1       T  r        superscript  e      t   subscript  normal-Δ  q       subscript  P  q    d  t              R  e   s     n  2      \zeta_{q}(s;\rho)=\sum_{\lambda_{j}>0}\lambda_{j}^{-s}=\frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\int%

In 1967 Seeley proved that     ζ  q    (  s  ;  ρ  )        subscript  ζ  q    s  ρ     \zeta_{q}(s;\rho)   extends to a meromorphic function of    s  ∈  𝐂      s  𝐂    s\in\mathbf{C}   which is holomorphic at    s  =  0      s  0    s=0   .  As in the case of an orthogonal representation, we define the analytic torsion     T  M    (  ρ  ;  E  )        subscript  T  M    ρ  E     T_{M}(\rho;E)   by       T  M    (  ρ  ;  E  )   =  exp   (   1  2    ∑   q  =  0   n     (  -  l  )   q   q   d   d  s     ζ  q    (  s  ;  ρ  )     |   s  =  0    )   .      fragments   subscript  T  M    fragments  normal-(  ρ  normal-;  E  normal-)      fragments  normal-(    1  2    subscript   superscript   n     q  0     superscript   fragments  normal-(   l  normal-)   q   q    d    d  s     subscript  ζ  q    fragments  normal-(  s  normal-;  ρ  normal-)    fragments   subscript  normal-|    s  0    normal-)   normal-.     T_{M}(\rho;E)=\exp\biggl(\frac{1}{2}\sum^{n}_{q=0}(-l)^{q}q\frac{d}{ds}\zeta_{%
 q}(s;\rho)\biggl|_{s=0}\biggr).     In 1971 D.B. Ray and I.M. Singer conjectured that      T  M    (  ρ  ;  E  )    =    τ  M    (  ρ  ;  μ  )           subscript  T  M    ρ  E       subscript  τ  M    ρ  μ      T_{M}(\rho;E)=\tau_{M}(\rho;\mu)   for any unitary representation   ρ   ρ   \rho   . Independently, J. Cheeger  and W. Muller  proved the Ray–Singer conjecture. Their idea is considering the logarithm of torsions and their traces. Firstly for odd-dimensional manifolds they had proved the equality of two torsions and then for even-dimensional, which have some technical difficulties.  In later years, along with Atiyah–Patodi–Singer theorem , the Cheeger–Müller theorem, i.e. the equivalence of two torsions, forms the basis of Chern–Simons perturbation theory .
