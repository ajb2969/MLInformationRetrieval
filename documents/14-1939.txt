Self nom at 22:36, 1 March 2012 (UTC)  :* hook, length, date are good, some of the sources are in Japanese but I could understand enough to check the hook.-- Kaly99 ( talk ) 23:26, 1 March 2012 (UTC)    Have since altered the formatting of the formula per the Reference Desk , but I don't think that should affect anything, Maculosae tegmine lyncis ( talk ) 15:51, 2 March 2012 (UTC)      I think this formula may break the formatting of the main page. Has anyone checked? Crisco 1492 ( talk ) 14:55, 8 March 2012 (UTC)   :*Tried promoting it. It looks terrible on the main page. Any alts? Crisco 1492 ( talk ) 00:06, 9 March 2012 (UTC)    Poor old scientists, can't they have any of their eye-candy? How about: Maculosae tegmine lyncis ( talk ) 15:40, 9 March 2012 (UTC)      ALT1 that the cherry blossom front in Japan is forecast by means of the Arrhenius equation ?  ALT1 only. Tick based on previous review. If there were a way to make the math smaller, it may be acceptable, but as used currently the original hook throws the page off balance.
