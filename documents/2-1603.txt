   Transmitter power output      Transmitter power output   In radio transmission , transmitter power output ( TPO ) is the actual amount of power (in watts ) of radio frequency (RF) energy that a transmitter produces at its output.  This is not the amount of power that a radio station reports as its power, as in "we're 100,000 watts of rock 'n' roll", which is usually the effective radiated power (ERP). The TPO for VHF-/UHF-transmitters is normally more than the ERP, for LF-/MF-transmitters it has nearly the same value, while for VLF-transmitters it may be less.  The radio antenna 's design "focuses" the signal toward the horizon , creating gain and increasing the ERP. There is also some loss (negative gain) from the feedline , which reduces some of the TPO to the antenna by both resistance and by radiating a small part of the signal.  The basic equation relating transmitter to effective power is:             T  P   O    ×  l   o  s    s   f  e  e  d  l  i  n  e      ×  g   a  i    n   a  n  t  e  n  n  a      =   E  R  P                 T  P  O   l   o  s   subscript  s    f  e  e  d  l  i  n  e     g   a  i   subscript  n    a  n  t  e  n  n  a       E  R  P     TPO\ \times\ loss_{feedline}\ \times\ gain_{antenna}\ =\ ERP        Note that in this formula the Antenna Gain is expressed with reference to a tuned dipole ( dBd )  See also   Effective radiated power  Nominal power  RF power margin   "  Category:Broadcast engineering  Category:Power (physics)  Category:Wireless transmitters
