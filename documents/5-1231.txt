Static spacetime

In general relativity, a spacetime is said to be static if it admits a global, non-vanishing, timelike Killing vector field

 
  which is irrotational, i.e., whose orthogonal distribution is involutive. (Note that the leaves of the associated foliation are necessarily space-like hypersurfaces.) Thus, a static spacetime is a stationary spacetime satisfying this additional integrability condition. These spacetimes form one of the simplest classes of Lorentzian manifolds.
Locally, every static spacetime looks like a standard static spacetime which is a Lorentzian warped product R

S with a metric of the form 
 
 
 
 , where R is the real line, 
 
 
 
 
  is a (positive definite) metric and 
 
 
 
  is a positive function on the Riemannian manifold S.
In such a local coordinate representation the Killing field

 
  may be identified with 
 
 
 
  and S, the manifold of 
 
 
 
 -trajectories, may be regarded as the instantaneous 3-space of stationary observers. If 
 
 
 
 
  is the square of the norm of the Killing vector field, 
 
 
 
 , both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are independent of time (in fact 
 
 
 
 ). It is from the latter fact that a static spacetime obtains its name, as the geometry of the space-like slice S does not change over time.
