   Static spacetime      Static spacetime   In general relativity , a spacetime is said to be static if it admits a global, non-vanishing, timelike  Killing vector field    K   K   K   which is irrotational , i.e. , whose orthogonal distribution is involutive . (Note that the leaves of the associated foliation are necessarily space-like hypersurfaces .) Thus, a static spacetime is a stationary spacetime satisfying this additional integrability condition. These spacetimes form one of the simplest classes of Lorentzian manifolds .  Locally, every static spacetime looks like a standard static spacetime which is a Lorentzian warped product R    ×     \times    S with a metric of the form     g   [   (  t  ,  x  )   ]    =    -   β   (  x  )   d   t  2     +    g  S    [  x  ]           g   delimited-[]   t  x           β  x  d   superscript  t  2        subscript  g  S    delimited-[]  x       g[(t,x)]=-\beta(x)dt^{2}+g_{S}[x]   , where R is the real line,    g  S     subscript  g  S    g_{S}   is a (positive definite) metric and   β   β   \beta   is a positive function on the Riemannian manifold  S .  In such a local coordinate representation the Killing field    K   K   K   may be identified with    ∂  t     subscript   t    \partial_{t}   and S , the manifold of   K   K   K   - trajectories , may be regarded as the instantaneous 3-space of stationary observers. If   λ   λ   \lambda   is the square of the norm of the Killing vector field,    λ  =   g   (  K  ,  K  )        λ    g   K  K      \lambda=g(K,K)   , both   λ   λ   \lambda   and    g  S     subscript  g  S    g_{S}   are independent of time (in fact    λ  =   -   β   (  x  )         λ      β  x      \lambda=-\beta(x)   ). It is from the latter fact that a static spacetime obtains its name, as the geometry of the space-like slice S does not change over time.
