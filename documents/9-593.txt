   Nagel point      Nagel point   In geometry , the Nagel point is a triangle center , one of the points associated with a given triangle whose definition does not depend on the placement or scale of the triangle. Given a triangle ABC , let T A , T B , and T C be the extouch points in which the A - excircle meets line BC , the B -excircle meets line CA , and C -excircle meets line AB , respectively. The lines AT A , BT B , CT C  concur in the Nagel point N of triangle ABC . The Nagel point is named after Christian Heinrich von Nagel , a nineteenth-century German mathematician, who wrote about it in 1836.  Another construction of the point T A is to start at A and trace around triangle ABC  half its perimeter , and similarly for T B and T C . Because of this construction, the Nagel point is sometimes also called the bisected perimeter point , and the segments AT A , BT B , CT C are called the triangle's splitters .  Relation to other triangle centers  The Nagel point is the isotomic conjugate of the Gergonne point . The Nagel point, the centroid , and the incenter are collinear on a line called the Nagel line . The incenter is the Nagel point of the medial triangle ; 1 2 equivalently, the Nagel point is the incenter of the anticomplementary triangle .  Trilinear coordinates  The trilinear coordinates of the Nagel point are 3 as        csc  2    (   A  /  2   )    :    csc  2    (   B  /  2   )    :    csc  2    (   C  /  2   )         normal-:    superscript   2     A  2      superscript   2     B  2      normal-:      superscript   2     C  2       \csc^{2}(A/2)\,:\,\csc^{2}(B/2)\,:\,\csc^{2}(C/2)     or, equivalently, in terms of the side lengths a = | BC |, b = | CA |, and c = | AB |,           b  +  c   -  a   a    :      c  +  a   -  b   b    :     a  +  b   -  c   c    .       normal-:        b  c   a   a         c  a   b   b     normal-:          a  b   c   c      \frac{b+c-a}{a}\,:\,\frac{c+a-b}{b}\,:\,\frac{a+b-c}{c}.
