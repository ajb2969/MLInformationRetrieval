   Glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase      Glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase   In enzymology , a glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-carboxybut-2-enoyl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   but-2-enoyl-CoA + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 4-carboxybut-2-enoyl-CoA , and two products , but-2-enoyl-CoA and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-carboxybut-2-enoyl-CoA carboxy-lyase (but-2-enoyl-CoA-forming) . Other names in common use include glutaconyl coenzyme A decarboxylase , pent-2-enoyl-CoA carboxy-lyase , and 4-carboxybut-2-enoyl-CoA carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via coa ligation and butanoate metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
