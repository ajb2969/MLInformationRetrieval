   Linearly disjoint      Linearly disjoint   In mathematics, algebras  A , B over a field k inside some field extension   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   of k (e.g., universal field ) are said to be linearly disjoint over k if the following equivalent conditions are met:   (i) The map     A   ⊗  k   B   →   A  B      normal-→    subscript  tensor-product  k   A  B     A  B     A\otimes_{k}B\to AB   induced by     (  x  ,  y  )   ↦   x  y      maps-to   x  y     x  y     (x,y)\mapsto xy   is injective.  (ii) Any k -basis of A remains linearly independent over B .  (iii) If     u  i   ,   v  j       subscript  u  i    subscript  v  j     u_{i},v_{j}   are k -bases for A , B , then the products     u  i    v  j        subscript  u  i    subscript  v  j     u_{i}v_{j}   are linearly independent over k .   Note that, since every subalgebra of   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is a domain, (i) implies    A   ⊗  k   B      subscript  tensor-product  k   A  B    A\otimes_{k}B   is a domain (in particular reduced ).  One also has: A , B are linearly disjoint over k if and only if subfields of   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   generated by    A  ,  B     A  B    A,B   , resp. are linearly disjoint over k . (cf. tensor product of fields )  Suppose A , B are linearly disjoint over k . If     A  ′   ⊂  A       superscript  A  normal-′   A    A^{\prime}\subset A   ,     B  ′   ⊂  B       superscript  B  normal-′   B    B^{\prime}\subset B   are subalgebras, then    A  ′     superscript  A  normal-′    A^{\prime}   and    B  ′     superscript  B  normal-′    B^{\prime}   are linearly disjoint over k . Conversely, if any finitely generated subalgebras of algebras A , B are linearly disjoint, then A , B are linearly disjoint (since the condition involves only finite sets of elements.)
