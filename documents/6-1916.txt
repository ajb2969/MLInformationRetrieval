Linearly disjoint

In mathematics, algebras A, B over a field k inside some field extension 
 
 
 
  of k (e.g., universal field) are said to be linearly disjoint over k if the following equivalent conditions are met:

(i) The map 
 
 
 
  induced by 
 
 
 
  is injective.
(ii) Any k-basis of A remains linearly independent over B.
(iii) If 
 
 
 
  are k-bases for A, B, then the products 
 
 
 
  are linearly independent over k.

Note that, since every subalgebra of 
 
 
 
  is a domain, (i) implies 
 
 
 
  is a domain (in particular reduced).
One also has: A, B are linearly disjoint over k if and only if subfields of 
 
 
 
  generated by 
 
 
 
 , resp. are linearly disjoint over k. (cf. tensor product of fields)
Suppose A, B are linearly disjoint over k. If 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are subalgebras, then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are linearly disjoint over k. Conversely, if any finitely generated subalgebras of algebras A, B are linearly disjoint, then A, B are linearly disjoint (since the condition involves only finite sets of elements.)
