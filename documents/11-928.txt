   Glycylpeptide N-tetradecanoyltransferase      Glycylpeptide N-tetradecanoyltransferase   In enzymology , a glycylpeptide N-tetradecanoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   tetradecanoyl-CoA + glycylpeptide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + N-tetradecanoylglycylpeptide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are tetradecanoyl-CoA and glycylpeptide , whereas its two products are CoA and N-tetradecanoylglycylpeptide .  Nomenclature  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is tetradecanoyl-CoA:glycylpeptide N-tetradecanoyltransferase . Other names in common use include peptide N-myristoyltransferase , myristoyl-CoA-protein N-myristoyltransferase , myristoyl-coenzyme A:protein N-myristoyl transferase , myristoylating enzymes , and protein N-myristoyltransferase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 9 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , and .
