Irradiance may be measured in space or at the Earth's surface after atmospheric absorption and scattering. Total solar irradiance (TSI), is a measure of the solar radiative power per unit area normal to the rays, incident on the Earth's upper atmosphere. The solar constant is a conventional measure of mean TSI at a distance of one Astronomical Unit (AU). Irradiance is a function of distance from the Sun, the solar cycle, and cross-cycle changes. 1 Irradiance on Earth is most intense at points directly facing (normal to) the Sun.  Units  The unit recommended by the World Meteorological Organization is the megajoule per square metre (MJ/m 2 ) or joule per square millimetre (J/mm 2 ). 2  An alternate unit of measure is the Langley (1 thermochemical calorie per square centimeter or 41,840 J/m 2 ) or irradiance per unit time.  The solar energy business uses watt-hour per square metre (Wh/m 2 ). Divided by the recording time, this measure becomes insolation, another unit of irradiance.  Insolation can be measured in space, at the edge of the atmosphere or at a terrestrial object.  Insolation can also be expressed in Suns, where one Sun equals 1000 W/m 2 at the point of arrival, with kWh/m 2 /day expressed as hours/day. 3  Absorption and reflection  Reaching an object, part of the irradiance is absorbed and the remainder reflected. Usually the absorbed radiation is converted to thermal energy, increasing the object's temperature. Manmade or natural systems, however, can convert part of the absorbed radiation into another form such as electricity or chemical bonds, as in the case of Photovoltaic cells or Plants . The proportion of reflected radiation is the object's Reflectivity or albedo .  Projection effect  Insolation onto a surface is largest when the surface directly faces (is normal to) the sun. As the angle between the surface and the Sun moves from normal, the insolation is reduced in proportion to the angle's Cosine ; see Effect_of_sun_angle_on_climate .  In the figure, the angle shown is between the ground and the sunbeam rather than between the vertical direction and the sunbeam; hence the sine rather than the cosine is appropriate. A sunbeam one mile (1.6 km) wide arrives from directly overhead, and another at a 30° angle to the horizontal. The Sine of a 30° angle is 1/2, whereas the sine of a 90° angle is 1. Therefore, the angled sunbeam spreads the light over twice the area. Consequently, half as much light falls on each square mile.  This 'projection effect' is the main reason why Earth's polar regions are much colder than equatorial regions . On an annual average the poles receive less insolation than does the equator, because the poles are always angled more away from the sun than the tropics. At a lower angle the light must travel through more atmosphere. This attenuates it (by absorption and scattering) further reducing insolation.  Categories   Direct insolation is measured at a given location with a surface element perpendicular to the Sun. It excludes diffuse insolation (radiation that is scattered or reflected by atmospheric components). Direct insolation is equal to the Solar_constant minus the atmospheric losses due to absorption and scattering . While the solar constant varies, losses depend on time of day (length of light's path through the atmosphere depending on the Solar_elevation_angle ), Cloud_cover , Moisture content and other contents . Insolation affects plant metabolism and animal behavior. 4  Diffuse insolation is the contribution of light scattered by the atmosphere to total insolation.  Earth  Average annual solar radiation arriving at the top of the Earth's atmosphere is roughly 1366 W/m 2. 5 6 The radiation is distributed across the Electromagnetic_spectrum , although most is Visible_light . The Sun's rays are attenuated as they pass through the Atmosphere , leaving maximum normal surface irradiance at approximately 1000 W /m 2 at Sealevel on a clear day.The actual figure varies with the Sun's angle and atmospheric circumstances. Ignoring clouds, the daily average irradiance for the Earth is approximately 250 W/m 2//hr = 6 kWh/m 2.  The output of, for example, a photovoltaic panel, partly depends on the angle of the sun relative to the panel. One Sun is a unit of power flux , not a standard value for actual insolation. Sometimes this unit is referred to as a Sol, not to be confused with a sol , meaning one solar day . 7  Solar potential maps  File:SolarGIS-Solar-map-North-America-en.png|North America File:SolarGIS-Solar-map-Latin-America-en.png|South America File:SolarGIS-Solar-map-Europe-en.png|Europe  File:SolarGIS-Solar-map-Africa-and-Middle-East-en.png|Africa and Middle East File:SolarGIS-Solar-map-South-And-South-East-Asia-en.png|South and South-East Asia File:SolarGIS-Solar-map-Australia-en.png|Australia  Top of the atmosphere  The distribution of solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere is determined by Earth's sphericity and orbital parameters. This applies to any unidirectional beam incident to a rotating sphere. Insolation is essential for Numerical_weather_prediction and understanding Seasons and Climate_change . Its application to Ice_ages is known as Milankovitch_cycles .  Distribution is based on a fundamental identity from Spherical_trigonometry , the spherical law of cosines :        cos   (  c  )    =     cos   (  a  )     cos   (  b  )     +    sin   (  a  )     sin   (  b  )     cos   (  C  )            c         a     b        a     b     C       \cos(c)=\cos(a)\cos(b)+\sin(a)\sin(b)\cos(C)\,      where a , b and c are arc lengths, in radians, of the sides of a spherical triangle. C is the angle in the vertex opposite the side which has arc length c . Applied to the calculation of Solar_zenith_angle Θ, the following applies to the Spherical_law_of_cosines :      C  =   h       C  h    C=h\,         c  =   Θ       c  normal-Θ    c=\Theta\,         a  =      1  2    π   -   ϕ        a        1  2   π   ϕ     a=\tfrac{1}{2}\pi-\phi\,         b  =      1  2    π   -   δ        b        1  2   π   δ     b=\tfrac{1}{2}\pi-\delta\,          cos   (  Θ  )    =     sin   (  ϕ  )     sin   (  δ  )     +    cos   (  ϕ  )     cos   (  δ  )     cos   (  h  )            normal-Θ         ϕ     δ        ϕ     δ     h       \cos(\Theta)=\sin(\phi)\sin(\delta)+\cos(\phi)\cos(\delta)\cos(h)\,   The separation of Earth from the sun can be denoted R E and the mean distance can be denoted R 0 , approximately 1 AU. The solar constant is denoted S 0 . The solar flux density (insolation) onto a plane tangent to the sphere of the Earth, but above the bulk of the atmosphere (elevation 100 km or greater) is:      Q  =    S  o     R  o  2    R  E  2     cos   (  Θ  )    when   cos   (  Θ  )     >  0        Q     subscript  S  o      superscript   subscript  R  o   2    superscript   subscript  R  E   2      normal-Θ   when    normal-Θ         0     Q=S_{o}\frac{R_{o}^{2}}{R_{E}^{2}}\cos(\Theta)\text{ when }\cos(\Theta)>0   and      Q  =   0  when   cos   (  Θ  )     ≤   0         Q    0  when    normal-Θ         0     Q=0\text{ when }\cos(\Theta)\leq 0\,   The average of Q over a day is the average of Q over one rotation, or the hour angle progressing from h = π to h = −π:        Q  ¯   day   =   -    1   2  π      ∫  π   -  π      Q   d  h           superscript   normal-¯  Q   day         1    2  π      superscript   subscript   π     π      Q  d  h        \overline{Q}^{\text{day}}=-\frac{1}{2\pi}{\int_{\pi}^{-\pi}Q\,dh}   Let h 0 be the hour angle when Q becomes positive.

 {o}\sin(\phi)\sin(\delta)+\cos(\phi)\cos(\delta)\sin(h_{o})\right]   Let θ be the conventional polar angle describing a planetary orbit . Let θ = 0 at the vernal equinox . The declination δ as a function of orbital position is       sin  δ   =    sin   ε     sin   (   θ  -  ϖ   )           δ       ε       θ  ϖ       \sin\delta=\sin\varepsilon~{}\sin(\theta-\varpi)\,   where ε is the obliquity . The conventional longitude of perihelion ϖ is defined relative to the vernal equinox, so for the elliptical orbit:       R  E   =    R  o    1  +   e   cos   (   θ  -  ϖ   )            subscript  R  E      subscript  R  o     1    e      θ  ϖ         R_{E}=\frac{R_{o}}{1+e\cos(\theta-\varpi)}   or        R  o    R  E    =   1  +   e   cos   (   θ  -  ϖ   )             subscript  R  o    subscript  R  E      1    e      θ  ϖ        \frac{R_{o}}{R_{E}}={1+e\cos(\theta-\varpi)}   With knowledge of ϖ, ε and e from astrodynamical calculations 8 and S o from a consensus of observations or theory,     Q  ¯   day     superscript   normal-¯  Q   day    \overline{Q}^{\mathrm{day}}   can be calculated for any latitude φ and θ. Because of the elliptical orbit, and as a consequence of Kepler's second law , θ does not progress uniformly with time. Nevertheless, θ = 0° is exactly the time of the vernal equinox, θ = 90° is exactly the time of the summer solstice, θ = 180° is exactly the time of the autumnal equinox and θ = 270° is exactly the time of the winter solstice.  Milankovitch cycles  Obtaining a time series for a     Q  ¯   day     superscript   normal-¯  Q   day    \overline{Q}^{\mathrm{day}}   for a particular time of year, and particular latitude, is a useful application in the theory of Milankovitch cycles. For example, at the summer solstice, the declination δ is equal to the obliquity ε. The distance from the sun is        R  o    R  E    =   1  +   e   cos   (   θ  -  ϖ   )      =   1  +   e   cos   (     π  2    -  ϖ   )      =   1  +   e   sin   (  ϖ  )               subscript  R  o    subscript  R  E      1    e      θ  ϖ             1    e        π  2   ϖ             1    e    ϖ        \frac{R_{o}}{R_{E}}=1+e\cos(\theta-\varpi)=1+e\cos(\tfrac{\pi}{2}-\varpi)=1+e%
 \sin(\varpi)   For this summer solstice calculation, the role of the elliptical orbit is entirely contained within the important product    e   sin   (  ϖ  )        e    ϖ     e\sin(\varpi)   , the precession index, whose variation dominates the variations in insolation at 65° N when eccentricity is large. For the next 100,000 years, with variations in eccentricity being relatively small, variations in obliquity dominate.  Applications  Buildings  In construction, insolation is an important consideration when designing a building for a particular site. 9 The projection effect can be used to design buildings that are cool in summer and warm in winter, by providing vertical windows on the equator-facing side of the building (the south face in the northern hemisphere , or the north face in the southern hemisphere ): this maximizes insolation in the winter months when the Sun is low in the sky and minimizes it in the summer when the Sun is high. (The Sun's north/south path through the sky spans 47 degrees through the year).  Solar power  Insolation figures are used as an input to worksheets to size solar power systems . 10 Because (except for asphalt solar collectors) 11 panels are almost always mounted at an angle 12 towards the sun, insolation must be adjusted to prevent estimates that are inaccurately low for winter and inaccurately high for summer. 13 In many countries the figures can be obtained from an insolation map or from insolation tables that reflect data over the prior 30–50 years. Photovoltaic panels are rated under standard conditions to determine the Wp rating ( watts peak ), 14 which can then be used with insolation to determine the expected output, adjusted by factors such as tilt, tracking and shading (which can be included to create the installed Wp rating). 15 Insolation values range from 800 to 950 kWh/(kWp·y) in Norway to up to 2,900 in Australia .  Climate research  Irradiance plays a part in climate modeling and weather forecasting .  Instrument inaccuracies add a significant uncertainty in determining Earth's energy balance . A non-zero average global net radiation at the top of the atmosphere is indicative of Earth's thermal disequilibrium as imposed by climate forcing . Whereas the energy balance is nominally 0.85 W m−2, estimates of this quantity from space-based measurements range from 3 to 7 W m−2. SORCE/TIM's lower TSI value reduces this discrepancy by 1 W m−2. This difference between the new lower TIM value and earlier TSI measurements corresponds to a climate forcing of −0.8 W m−2, which is comparable to the energy imbalance. 16  The impact of the new lower TSI value on climate models is unknown. A few tenths of a percent change in the absolute TSI level is typically considered to be of minimal consequence for climate simulations. The new measurements require climate model parameter adjustments. Experiments with GISS Model 3 investigated the sensitivity of model performance to the TSI absolute value during present and pre-industrial epochs, and describe, for example, how the irradiance reduction is partitioned between the atmosphere and surface and the effects on outgoing radiation. 17  Accuracy uncertainties of  Long-term radiometer drifts can be mistaken for irradiance variations that can be misinterpreted as affecting climate. Examples include the issue of the irradiance increase between cycle minima in 1986 and 1996, evident only in the ACRIM composite (and not the model) and the low irradiance levels in the PMOD composite during the 2008 minimum. Assessing the impact of long-term irradiance changes on climate requires greater instrument stability. 18  Long-term measurement accuracy combined with reliable global surface temperature observations are necessary for quantifying climate response processes to radiative forcing on decadal time scales. The observed 0.1% irradiance increase imparts 0.22 W m−2 climate forcing, which suggests a transient climate response of 0.6 °C per W m−2. This response is larger by a factor of 2 or more than in the IPCC-assessed 2008 models, possibly appearing in the models' heat uptake by the ocean. 19  The most probable value of TSI representative of solar minimum is 1360.8 ± 0.5 W m−2, lower than the earlier canonical value of 1365.4 ± 1.3 W m−2 as measured by SORCE/TIM. In addition to the offsets, published irradiance observations lack coherent temporal structure. A regression model-based split of the relative proportion of sunspot and facular influences from SORCE/TIM data accounts for 92% of observed variance and tracks the observed trends to within TIM's stability band. This agreement provides further evidence that TSI variations are primarily due to solar surface magnetic activity. 20  In 2014 a new ACRIM composite was developed using the updated ACRI M3 record. It added corrections for scattering and diffraction revealed during recent testing and two algorithm updates. The testing was performed at TRF. The algorithm updates were more accurately account for instrument thermal behavior and parsing of shutter cycle data. These corrected a component of the quasi-annual signal and increased the signal to noise ratio , respectively. The net effect of these corrections decreased the average ACRIM3 TSI value from as above without affecting the trending in the ACRIM Composite TSI. 21  Differences between ACRIM and PMOD TSI composites are evident, but the most significant is the solar minimum-to-minimum trends during solar cycles 21 - 23 . ACRIM established an increase of +0.037%/decade from 1980 to 2000 and a decrease thereafter. PMOD instead presents a steady decrease since 1978. Significant differences can also be seen during the peak of solar cycles 21 and 22. These arise from the fact that ACRIM uses the original TSI results published by the satellite experiment teams while PMOD significantly modifies some results to conform them to specific TSI proxy models. . The implications of increasing TSI during the global warming of the last two decades of the 20th century are that solar forcing of climate change may be a significantly larger factor than represented in the CMIP5  general circulation climate models . 22  Space travel  Insolation is the primary variable affecting equilibrium temperature in spacecraft design and planetology .  Solar activity and irradiance measurement is a concern for space travel. For example, the American space agency, NASA , launched its Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite with Solar Irradiance Monitors . 23  Civil engineering  In civil engineering and hydrology , numerical models of snowmelt runoff use observations of insolation. This permits estimation of the rate at which water is released from a melting snowpack. Field measurement is accomplished using a pyranometer .      Conversion factor (multiply top row by factor to obtain side column)          W/m 2     kW·h/(m 2 ·day)     sun hours/day     kWh/(m 2 ·y)     kWh/(kWp·y)     Measurement  All TSI satellite instruments employ a common approach, active cavity electrical substitution radiometry . This technique applies measured electrical heating to maintain an absorptive blackened cavity in thermal equilibrium while incident sunlight passes through a precision aperture of calibrated area. The aperture is modulated via a shutter . In orbit, radiometric calibrations drift for reasons including solar degradation of the cavity, electronic degradation of the heater, surface degradation of the precision aperture and varying surface emissions and temperatures that alter thermal backgrounds. These calibrations require compensation to preserve consistent measurements. 24  The space-based TSI record comprises measurements from more than ten radiometers spanning three solar cycles. For various reasons, the sources do not always agree. The Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment/Total Irradiance Measurement ( SORCE /TIM) TSI values are lower than prior measurements by the Earth Radiometer Budget Experiment (ERBE) on the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS), VIRGO on the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) and the ACRIM instruments on the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM), Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), and ACRIMSat . Ground calibrations relied on component rather than system level measurements, since irradiance standards prior to their launches lacked absolute accuracies. 25  Uncertainties of individual irradiance observations exceed solar irradiance variations (∼0.1%). Thus, instrument stability and measurement continuity are relied upon to compute real variations. Instrument stability involves exposing redundant radiometer cavities to different accumulations of solar radiation to quantify exposure-dependent degradation effects that are then compensated for in final data. Sequential radiometer observation overlaps permits corrections for absolute offsets and validation of instrumental drifts. 26  Despite the fact that ACRIM I, ACRIM II, ACRIM III, VIRGO, and TIM all track degradation with redundant cavities, notable and unexplained differences remain in irradiance and the modeled influences of sunspots and faculae . Features not easily attributable to solar activity include an annual cycle that is nearly in phase with the Sun-Earth distance in ACRIM III data, and 90-day spikes in the VIRGO data coincident with SoHO spacecraft maneuvers that are most apparent during the 2008 solar minimum. Disagreement among overlapping observations indicates unresolveded drifts that suggest the TSI record is not sufficiently stable to discern solar changes on decadal time scales. Only the ACRIM composite shows irradiance increasing by ∼1 W m−2 between 1986 and 1996; this change is also absent in the model. 27  Recommendations to resolve the instrument discrepancies include validating optical measurement accuracy by comparing ground-based instruments to laboratory references, such as those at National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST); NIST validation of aperture area calibrations using spares from each instrument; and applying diffraction corrections from the view-limiting aperture. 28  For ACRIM, NIST determined that diffraction from the view-limiting aperture contributes a 0.13% signal not accounted for in the three ACRIM instruments. This correction lowers the reported ACRIM values, bringing ACRIM closer to TIM. In ACRIM and all other instruments, the aperture is deep inside the instrument, with a larger view-limiting aperture at the front. Depending on edge imperfections this can directly scatter light into the cavity. This design admits two to three times the amount of light intended to be measured; if not completely absorbed or scattered, this additional light produces erroneously high signals. In contrast, TIM's design places the precision aperture at the front so that only desired light enters. 29  TSI Radiometer Facility  TIM's high absolute accuracy creates new opportunities for measuring climate variables. TSI Radiometer Facility (TRF) is a cryogenic radiometer that operates in a vacuum with controlled light sources. L-1 Standards and Technology (LASP) designed and built the system, completed in 2008. It was calibrated for optical power against the NIST Primary Optical Watt Radiometer, a cryogenic radiometer that maintains the NIST radiant power scale to an uncertainty of 0.02% (1 σ ). As of 2011 TRF was the only facility that approached the desired  TRF encloses both the reference radiometer and the instrument under test in a common vacuum system that contains a stationary, spatially uniform illuminating beam. A precision aperture with area calibrated to 0.0031% (1 σ ) determines the beam's measured portion. The test instrument's precision aperture is positioned in the same location, without optically altering the beam, for direct comparison to the reference. Variable beam power provides linearity diagnostics, and variable beam diameter diagnoses scattering from different instrument components. 30  The Glory/TIM and PICARD/PREMOS flight instrument absolute scales are now traceable to the TRF in both optical power and irradiance. The resulting high accuracy reduces the consequences of any future gap in the solar irradiance record. 31      Difference Relative to TRF 32   Instrument   Irradiance: View-Limiting Aperture Overfilled   Irradiance: Precision Aperture Overfilled   Difference Attributable To Scatter Error   Measured Optical Power Error   Residual Irradiance Agreement   Uncertainty     SORCE/TIM ground   NA   −0.037%   NA   −0.037%   0.000%   0.032%     Glory/TIM flight   NA   −0.012%   NA   −0.029%   0.017%   0.020%     PREMOS-1 ground   −0.005%   −0.104%   0.098%   −0.049%   −0.104%   ∼0.038%     PREMOS-3 flight   0.642%   0.605%   0.037%   0.631%   −0.026%   ∼0.027%     VIRGO-2 ground   0.897%   0.743%   0.154%   0.730%   0.013%   ∼0.025%     References  See also   Earth's energy budget  PI curve (photosynthesis-irradiance curve)  Irradiance  Albedo  Earth's energy budget  Flux  Power density  Sky footage  Sun chart  Sunlight    External links   San Francisco Solar Map  European Commission- Interactive Maps  Yesterday‘s Australian Solar Radiation Map  Net surface solar radiation  Maps of Solar Radiation  Solar Radiation using Google Maps  Sample Calculations based on US Insolation Map  Solar Radiation on a Tilted Collector (U.S.A. only) choose "Theoretically Perfect Collector" to receive results for the insolation on a tilted surface  Annual Optimal Orientation of Fixed Tilt Solar Collectors (U.S.A. only)  SMARTS, software to compute solar insolation of each date/location of earth 3  Solar Radiation and Clouds - A Discussion  NASA Surface meteorology and Solar Energy  insol: R package for insolation on complex terrain  Online insolation calculator   "  Category:Atmospheric radiation  Category:Solar System  Category:Solar phenomena     Michael Boxwell, Solar Electricity Handbook: A Simple, Practical Guide to Solar Energy (2012), p. 41–42. ↩  ↩  U.S. Solar Radiation Resource Maps retrieved 29 October 2012 ↩  C.Michael Hogan. 2010.
