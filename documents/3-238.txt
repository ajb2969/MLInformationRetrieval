   Valuation (algebra)      Valuation (algebra)   In algebra (in particular in algebraic geometry or algebraic number theory ), a valuation is a function on a field that provides a measure of size or multiplicity of elements of the field. They generalize to commutative algebra the notion of size inherent in consideration of the degree of a pole or multiplicity of a zero in complex analysis, the degree of divisibility of a number by a prime number in number theory, and the geometrical concept of contact between two algebraic or analytic varieties in algebraic geometry. A field with a valuation on it is called a valued field .  Definition  To define the algebraic concept of valuation, the following objects are needed:   a field    K   K   K   and its multiplicative subgroup  K × ,  an abelian  totally ordered group     (  Γ  ,  +  ,  ≥  )     normal-Γ   normal-≥    (Γ,+,≥)   (which could also be given in multiplicative notation as    (  Γ  ,  ·  ,  ≥  )     normal-Γ  normal-·  normal-≥    (Γ,·,≥)   ).   The ordering and group law on   Γ   normal-Γ   Γ   are extended to the set  1 by the rules       ∞  ≥  α      normal-∞  normal-≥  α    ∞≥α   for all   α   α   α   in   Γ   normal-Γ   Γ   ,       ∞  +  α   =   α  +  ∞   =  ∞          normal-∞  α     α  normal-∞        normal-∞     ∞+α=α+∞=∞   for all α in   Γ   normal-Γ   Γ   .   Then a valuation of   K   K   K    is any map      which satisfies the following properties for all a , b in K :        v   (  a  )    =  ∞        v  a   normal-∞    v(a)=∞   if, and only if,    a  =  0      a  0    a=0   ,       v   (   a  b   )    =    v   (  a  )    +   v   (  b  )           v    a  b        v  a     v  b      v(ab)=v(a)+v(b)   ,      v   (   a  +  b   )   ≥  m  i  n   (   v   (  a  )    ,   v   (  b  )    )       v    a  b   normal-≥  m  i  n     v  a     v  b      v(a+b)≥min(v(a),v(b))   , with equality if v ( a )≠ v ( b ).   Some authors use the term exponential valuation rather than "valuation". In this case the term "valuation" means " absolute value ".  A valuation v is called trivial (or the trivial valuation of   K   K   K    ) if v ( a ) = 0 for all a in K × , otherwise it is called non-trivial .  For valuations used in geometric applications, the first property implies that any non-empty germ of an analytic variety near a point contains that point. The second property asserts that any valuation is a group homomorphism , while the third property is a translation of the triangle inequality from metric spaces to ordered groups.  It is possible to give a dual definition of the same concept using the multiplicative notation for Γ: if, instead of ∞, an element O 2 is given and the ordering and group law on Γ are extended by the rules       O  ≤  α      O  normal-≤  α    O≤α   for all   α   α   α   in   Γ   normal-Γ   Γ   ,       O  ·  α   =   α  ·  O   =  O          O  normal-·  α     α  normal-·  O        O     O·α=α·O=O   for all α in   Γ   normal-Γ   Γ   ,   then a valuation of K is any map      satisfying the following properties for all a , b in K :        v   (  a  )    =  O        v  a   O    v(a)=O   if, and only if,    a  =  0      a  0    a=0   ,       v   (   a  b   )    =   v   (  a  )   ·  v   (  b  )          v    a  b      v  a  normal-·  v  b     v(ab)=v(a)·v(b)   ,      v   (   a  +  b   )   ≤  m  a  x   (   v   (  a  )    ,   v   (  b  )    )       v    a  b   normal-≤  m  a  x     v  a     v  b      v(a+b)≤max(v(a),v(b))   , with equality if v ( a )≠ v ( b ).   (Note that in this definition, the directions of the inequalities are reversed.)  A valuation is commonly assumed to be surjective , since many arguments used in ordinary mathematical research involving those objects use preimages of unspecified elements of the ordered group contained in its codomain . Also, the first definition of valuation given is more frequently encountered in ordinary mathematical research , thus it is the only one used in the following considerations and examples.  Associated objects  If  is a valuation, then there are several objects that can be defined from it:   the value group of v (or valuation group of v ), denoted , is v ( K × ), it is a subgroup of   Γ   normal-Γ   Γ   ,  the valuation ring of v , denoted R v is the set of elements a of   K   K   K   such that v ( a ) ≥ 0, it is a valuation ring ,  the prime ideal of v (or the maximal ideal of v ), denoted m v is the set of elements a of K such that v ( a ) > 0, it is a maximal ideal of R v ,  the residue field of v , denoted k v is R v / m v , it is a field.  a place of   K   K   K   into  whose restriction to R v is the natural projection.   Basic properties  Equivalence of valuations  Two valuations v 1 and v 2 of   K   K   K   with valuation group Γ 1 and Γ 2 , respectively, are said to be equivalent if there is an order-preserving group isomorphism  such that v 2 ( a ) = φ( v 1 ( a )) for all a in K × . This is an equivalence relation .  Two valuations of K are equivalent if, and only if, they have the same valuation ring.  An equivalence class of valuations of a field is called a place . Ostrowski's theorem gives a complete classification of places of the field of rational numbers    𝐐   𝐐   \mathbf{Q}   : these are precisely the equivalence classes of valuations for the p -adic  completions of   𝐐   𝐐   \mathbf{Q}   .  Extension of valuations  Let v be a valuation of   K   K   K   and let L be a field extension of   K   K   K   . An extension of v (to L ) is a valuation w of L such that the restriction of w to   K   K   K   is v . The set of all such extensions is studied in the ramification theory of valuations .  Let L / K be a finite extension and let w be an extension of v to L . The index of Γ v in Γ w , e( w / v ) = [Γ w : Γ v ], is called the reduced ramification index of w over v . It satisfies e( w / v ) ≤ [ L : K ] (the degree of the extension L / K ). The relative degree of w over v is defined to be f ( w / v ) = [ R w / m w : R v / m v ] (the degree of the extension of residue fields). It is also less than or equal to the degree of L / K . When L / K is separable , the ramification index of w over v is defined to be e( w / v ) p i , where p i is the inseparable degree of the extension R w / m w over R v / m v .  Complete valued fields  When the ordered abelian group   Γ   normal-Γ   Γ   is the additive group of the integers , the associated valuation induces a metric on the field   K   K   K   . If   K   K   K   is complete with respect to this metric, then it is called a complete valued field . In general, a valuation induces a uniform structure on   K   K   K   , and   K   K   K   is called a complete valued field if it is complete as a uniform space. There is a related property known as spherical completeness : it is equivalent to completeness if    Γ  =  𝐙      normal-Γ  𝐙    Γ=\mathbf{Z}   , but stronger in general.  Examples     π   π   π   -adic valuation  Let   R   R   R   be a principal ideal domain ,   K   K   K   be its field of fractions , and   π   π   π   be an irreducible element of   R   R   R   . Since every principal ideal domain is a unique factorization domain , every non-zero element a of   R   R   R   can be written (essentially) uniquely as      a  =    π   e  a     p  1   e  1     p  2   e  2    ⋯   p  n   e  n         a     superscript  π   subscript  e  a     superscript   subscript  p  1    subscript  e  1     superscript   subscript  p  2    subscript  e  2    normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  p  n    subscript  e  n       a=\pi^{e_{a}}p_{1}^{e_{1}}p_{2}^{e_{2}}\cdots p_{n}^{e_{n}}     where the e 's are non-negative integers and the p i are irreducible elements of   R   R   R   that are not associates of   π   π   π   . In particular, the integer e a is uniquely determined by a .  The π-adic valuation of K is then given by         v  π    (  0  )    =  ∞         subscript  v  π   0      v_{\pi}(0)=\infty            v  π    (   a  /  b   )    =     e  a   -   e  b    ,   for  a     ,    b  ∈   R  ,  a    ,   b  ≠  0.       formulae-sequence       subscript  v  π     a  b        subscript  e  a    subscript  e  b      for  a      formulae-sequence    b   R  a      b  0.      v_{\pi}(a/b)=e_{a}-e_{b},\text{ for }a,b\in R,a,b\neq 0.      If π' is another irreducible element of   R   R   R   such that (π') = (π) (that is, they generate the same ideal in R ), then the π-adic valuation and the π'-adic valuation are equal. Thus, the π-adic valuation can be called the P -adic valuation, where P = (π).  When    R  =  𝐙      R  𝐙    R=\mathbf{Z}   , then    K  =  𝐐      K  𝐐    K=\mathbf{Q}   , and   π   π   π   is some prime number  p (or its negative). The π-adic valuation obtained is the p -adic valuation on   𝐐   𝐐   \mathbf{Q}   .   P -adic valuation on a Dedekind domain  The previous example can be generalized to Dedekind domains . Let   R   R   R   be a Dedekind domain,   K   K   K   its field of fractions, and let P be a non-zero prime ideal of   R   R   R   . Then, the localization of   R   R   R   at P , denoted R P , is a principal ideal domain whose field of fractions is   K   K   K   . The construction of the previous section applied to the prime ideal PR P of R P yields the    P   P   P   -adic valuation of   K   K   K    .  Geometric notion of contact  Let     𝐂  x  x   ,  y  ,   𝐂   (  x  ,  y  )         𝐂  x  x   y    𝐂   x  y      \mathbf{C}xx,y,\mathbf{C}(x,y)   be the ring of complex polynomials of two variables and the field of complex rational functions respectively. Consider the (convergent) power series       f   (  x  ,  y  )    =   y  -    ∑   n  =  3   ∞    x  n     ∈   𝐂   {  x  ,  y  }            f   x  y      y    superscript   subscript     n  3       superscript  x  n            𝐂   x  y       f(x,y)=y-\sum_{n=3}^{\infty}x^{n}\in\mathbf{C}\{x,y\}     whose zero set , the analytic variety , can be parametrized by one coordinate    t   t   t   as follows       V  f   =   {    (  x  ,  y  )   ∈    𝐂  2     :    f   (  x  ,  y  )    =  0   }   =   {    (  x  ,  y  )   ∈    𝐂  2     :    (  x  ,  y  )   =   (  t  ,    ∑   n  =  3   ∞    t  n    )    }          subscript  V  f    conditional-set     x  y    superscript  𝐂  2        f   x  y    0          conditional-set     x  y    superscript  𝐂  2       x  y    t    superscript   subscript     n  3       superscript  t  n          V_{f}=\left\{(x,y)\in\mathbf{C}^{2}\ :\ f(x,y)=0\right\}=\left\{(x,y)\in%
 \mathbf{C}^{2}\ :\ (x,y)=\left(t,\sum_{n=3}^{\infty}t^{n}\right)\right\}     It is possible to define a map    v  :    𝐂  x  x   ,   y  →  𝐙       normal-:  v     𝐂  x  x     y  normal-→  𝐙      v:\mathbf{C}xx,y→\mathbf{Z}   as the value of the order of the formal power series in the variable   t   t   t   obtained by restriction of any polynomial   P   P   P   in     𝐂  x  x   ,  y       𝐂  x  x   y    \mathbf{C}xx,y   to the points of the set        v   (  P  )    =    ord  t    (    P  |    V  f    )    =    ord  t    (   P   (  t  ,    ∑   n  =  3   ∞    t  n    )    )     ,    ∀  P   ∈   𝐂   [  x  ,  y  ]        formulae-sequence        v  P      subscript  ord  t    evaluated-at  P   subscript  V  f             subscript  ord  t     P   t    superscript   subscript     n  3       superscript  t  n            for-all  P     𝐂   x  y       v(P)=\mathrm{ord}_{t}\left(P|_{V_{f}}\right)=\mathrm{ord}_{t}\left(P\left(t,%
 \sum_{n=3}^{\infty}t^{n}\right)\right),\qquad\forall P\in\mathbf{C}[x,y]     It is also possible to extend the map   v   v   v   from its original ring of definition to the whole field    𝐂   (  x  ,  y  )       𝐂   x  y     \mathbf{C}(x,y)   as follows       v   (   P  /  Q   )    =   {       v   (  P  )    -   v   (  Q  )         P  /  Q   ∈   𝐂    (  x  ,  y  )   *         ∞     P  ≡  0  ∈   𝐂   (  x  ,  y  )               v    P  Q     cases      v  P     v  Q        P  Q     𝐂   superscript   x  y            P  0         𝐂   x  y         v(P/Q)=\begin{cases}v(P)-v(Q)&P/Q\in{\mathbf{C}(x,y)}^{*}\\
 \infty&P\equiv 0\in\mathbf{C}(x,y)\end{cases}     As the power series   f   f   f   is not a polynomial , it is easy to prove that the extended map   v   v   v   is a valuation: the value    v   (  P  )       v  P    v(P)   is called intersection number between the curves (1- dimensional  analytic varieties ) and . As an example, the computation of some intersection numbers follows:      v   (  x  )       v  x    \displaystyle v(x)     Vector spaces over valuation fields  Suppose that   Γ   normal-Γ   Γ   is the set of non-negative real numbers. Then we say that the valuation is non-discrete if its range is not finite.  Suppose that X is a vector space over K and that A and B are subsets of X . Then we say that A absorbs B if there exists a α in K such that λ in K and |λ| ≥ |α| implies that B ⊆ λ A . A is called radial or absorbing if A absorbs every finite subset of X . Radial subsets of X are invariant under finite intersection. And A is called circled if λ in K and |λ| ≥ |α| implies λ A ⊆ A . The set of circled subsets of L is invariant under arbitrary intersections. The circled hull of A is the intersection of all circled subsets of X containing A .  Suppose that X and Y are vector spaces over a non-discrete valuation field K , let A ⊆ X , B ⊆ Y , and let f : X → Y be a linear map. If B is circled or radial then so is     f   -  1     (  B  )        superscript  f    1    B    f^{-1}(B)   . If A is circled then so is f(A) but if A is radial then f(A) will be radial under the additional condition that f is surjective.
