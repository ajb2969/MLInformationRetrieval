   Mannitol dehydrogenase (cytochrome)      Mannitol dehydrogenase (cytochrome)   In enzymology , a mannitol dehydrogenase (cytochrome) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-mannitol + ferricytochrome c   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-fructose + ferrocytochrome c   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-mannitol and ferricytochrome c , whereas its two products are D-fructose and ferrocytochrome c .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , to be specific those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with a cytochrome as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-mannitol:ferricytochrome-c 2-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called polyol dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions and fructose and mannose metabolism  References      "  Category:EC 1.1.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
