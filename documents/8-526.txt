   Family of curves      Family of curves   A family of curves is a set of curves , each of which is given by a function or parametrization in which one or more of the parameters is variable. In general, the parameter(s) influence the shape of the curve in a way that is more complicated than a simple linear transformation . Sets of curves given by an implicit relation may also represent families of curves.  Families of curves appear frequently in solutions of differential equations ; when an additive constant of integration is introduced, it will usually be manipulated algebraically until it no longer represents a simple linear transformation.  Families of curves may also arise in other areas. For example, all non-degenerate conic sections can be represented using a single polar equation with one parameter, the eccentricity of the curve:       r   (  θ  )    =   e   1  +   e   cos  θ            r  θ     e    1    e    θ        r(\theta)={e\over 1+e\cos\theta}     as the value of e changes, the appearance of the curve varies in a relatively complicated way.  Applications  Families of curves may arise in various topics in geometry, including the envelope of a set of curves and the caustic of a given curve.  Generalizations  In algebraic geometry , an algebraic generalization is given by the notion of a linear system of divisors .  "  Category:Algebraic geometry
