Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and H2O, whereas its two products are CoA and acetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA hydrolase. Other names in common use include acetyl-CoA deacylase, acetyl-CoA acylase, acetyl coenzyme A hydrolase, acetyl coenzyme A deacylase, acetyl coenzyme A acylase, and acetyl-CoA thiol esterase. This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
