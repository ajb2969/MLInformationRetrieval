   D-lyxose ketol-isomerase      D-lyxose ketol-isomerase   In enzymology , a D-lyxose ketol-isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-lyxose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-xylulose   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , D-lyxose , and one product , D-xylulose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases interconverting aldoses and ketoses . The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-lyxose aldose-ketose-isomerase . Other names in common use include D-lyxose isomerase , and D-lyxose ketol-isomerase . This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
