   D'Alembert–Euler condition      D'Alembert–Euler condition   In mathematics and physics , especially the study of mechanics and fluid dynamics , the d'Alembert-Euler condition is a requirement that the streaklines of a flow are irrotational . Let x = x ( X , t ) be the coordinates of the point x into which X is carried at time t by a (fluid) flow. Let     𝐱  ¨   =     D  2   𝐱    D  t         normal-¨  𝐱        superscript  D  2   𝐱     D  t      \ddot{\mathbf{x}}=\frac{D^{2}\mathbf{x}}{Dt}   be the second material derivative of x . Then the d'Alembert-Euler condition is:        curl   𝐱   =   0.         curl  𝐱   0.    \mathrm{curl}\ \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}.\,     The d'Alembert-Euler condition is named for Jean le Rond d'Alembert and Leonhard Euler who independently first described its use in the mid-18th century. It is not to be confused with the Cauchy–Riemann conditions .
