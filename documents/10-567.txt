   L-gulonate 3-dehydrogenase      L-gulonate 3-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a L-gulonate 3-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-gulonate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-dehydro-L-gulonate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-gulonate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 3-dehydro-L-gulonate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-gulonate:NAD + 3-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include L-3-aldonate dehydrogenase , L-3-aldonic dehydrogenase , L-gulonic acid dehydrogenase , L-beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase , L-beta-hydroxy-acid-NAD + -oxidoreductase , and L-3-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
