   Hyponormal operator      Hyponormal operator   In mathematics , especially operator theory , a hyponormal operator is a generalization of a normal operator . In general, a bounded linear operator  T on a complex Hilbert space  H is said to be p -hyponormal (    0  <  p  ≤  1        0  p       1     0   ) if:        (    T  *   T   )   p   ≥    (   T   T  *    )   p        superscript     superscript  T    T   p    superscript    T   superscript  T     p     (T^{*}T)^{p}\geq(TT^{*})^{p}   (That is to say,      (    T  *   T   )   p   -    (   T   T  *    )   p        superscript     superscript  T    T   p    superscript    T   superscript  T     p     (T^{*}T)^{p}-(TT^{*})^{p}   is a positive operator.) If    p  =  1      p  1    p=1   , then T is called a hyponormal operator. If    p  =   1  /  2       p    1  2     p=1/2   , then T is called a semi-hyponormal operator. Moreoever, T is said to be log-hyponormal if it is invertible and        log   (    T  *   T   )    ≥   log   (   T   T  *    )     .           superscript  T    T        T   superscript  T        \log(T^{*}T)\geq\log(TT^{*}).   An invertible p -hyponormal operator is log-hyponormal. On the other hand, not every log-hyponormal is p -hyponormal.  The class of semi-hyponormal operators was introduced by Xia, and the class of p-hyponormal operators was studied by Aluthge, who used what is today called the Aluthge transformation .  Every subnormal operator (in particular, a normal operator) is hyponormal, and every hyponormal operator is a paranormal  convexoid operator . Not every paranormal operator is, however, hyponormal.
