Hutchinson metric

 
In mathematics, the Hutchinson metric is a function which measures "the discrepancy between two images for use in fractal image processing" and "can also be applied to describe the similarity between DNA sequences expressed as real or complex genomic signals."12
Formal definition
Consider only nonempty, compact, and finite metric spaces. For a space 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  denote the space of Borel probability measures on 
 
 
 
 , with



the embedding associating to 
 
 
 
  the point measure 
 
 
 
 . The support 
 
 
 
  of a measure in P(X) is the smallest closed subset of measure 1.
If



is Borel measurable then the induced map



associates to 
 
 
 
  the measure 
 
 
 
  defined by



for all 
 
 
 
  Borel in 
 
 
 
 .
Then the Hutchinson metric is given by



where the 
 
 
 
  is taken over all real-valued functions u with Lipschitz constant


Then 
 
 
 
  is an isometric embedding of 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
 , and if



is Lipschitz then



is Lipschitz with the same Lipschitz constant.3
