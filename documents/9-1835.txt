   Hutchinson metric      Hutchinson metric     In mathematics , the Hutchinson metric is a function which measures "the discrepancy between two images for use in fractal  image processing " and "can also be applied to describe the similarity between DNA sequences expressed as real or complex genomic signals." 1 2  Formal definition  Consider only nonempty, compact , and finite metric spaces . For a space    X    X   X\,   , let    P   (  X  )       P  X    P(X)\,   denote the space of Borel probability measures on    X    X   X\,   , with      δ  :   X  →   P   (  X  )        normal-:  δ   normal-→  X    P  X      \delta:X\rightarrow P(X)\,     the embedding associating to    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   the point measure     δ  x      subscript  δ  x    \delta_{x}\,   . The support    |  μ  |      μ    |\mu|\,   of a measure in P(X) is the smallest closed subset of measure 1.  If      f  :    X  1   →    X  2        normal-:  f   normal-→   subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2      f:X_{1}\rightarrow X_{2}\,     is Borel measurable then the induced map       f  *   :    P   (   X  1   )    →   P   (   X  2   )        normal-:   subscript  f     normal-→    P   subscript  X  1      P   subscript  X  2       f_{*}:P(X_{1})\rightarrow P(X_{2})\,     associates to    μ    μ   \mu\,   the measure     f  *    (  μ  )        subscript  f    μ    f_{*}(\mu)\,   defined by        f  *    (  μ  )    (  B  )    =   μ   (    f   -  1     (  B  )    )           subscript  f    μ  B     μ     superscript  f    1    B      f_{*}(\mu)(B)=\mu(f^{-1}(B))\,     for all    B    B   B\,   Borel in     X  2      subscript  X  2    X_{2}\,   .  Then the Hutchinson metric is given by       d   (   μ  1   ,   μ  2   )    =   sup   {    ∫   u   (  x  )    μ  1    (   d  x   )     -   ∫   u   (  x  )    μ  2    (   d  x   )      }          d    subscript  μ  1    subscript  μ  2      supremum         u  x   subscript  μ  1     d  x         u  x   subscript  μ  2     d  x          d(\mu_{1},\mu_{2})=\sup\left\{\int u(x)\,\mu_{1}(dx)-\int u(x)\,\mu_{2}(dx)\right\}     where the   sup   supremum   \sup   is taken over all real-valued functions u with Lipschitz constant      ≤  1 .      absent  1 .    \leq 1\,.     Then    δ    δ   \delta\,   is an isometric embedding of    X    X   X\,   into    P   (  X  )       P  X    P(X)\,   , and if      f  :    X  1   →    X  2        normal-:  f   normal-→   subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2      f:X_{1}\rightarrow X_{2}\,     is Lipschitz then       f  *   :    P   (   X  1   )    →   P   (   X  2   )        normal-:   subscript  f     normal-→    P   subscript  X  1      P   subscript  X  2       f_{*}:P(X_{1})\rightarrow P(X_{2})\,     is Lipschitz with the same Lipschitz constant. 3  See also   Acoustic metric  Apophysis (software)  Complete metric  Fractal image compression  Image differencing  Metric tensor  Multifractal system   Sources and notes  "  Category:Metric geometry  Category:Topology     Efficient computation of the Hutchinson metric between digitized images abstract ↩  HUTCHINSON METRIC IN FRACTAL DNA ANALYSIS -- A NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH ↩  Invariant Measures for Set-Valued Dynamical Systems Walter Miller; Ethan Akin Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 351, No. 3.
