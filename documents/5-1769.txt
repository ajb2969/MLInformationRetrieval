   Null dust solution      Null dust solution   In mathematical physics, a null dust solution (sometimes called a null fluid ) is a Lorentzian manifold in which the Einstein tensor is null . Such a spacetime can be interpreted as an exact solution of Einstein's field equation , in which the only mass-energy present in the spacetime is due to some kind of massless radiation .  Mathematical definition  The Einstein tensor of a null dust must have the form     G   a  b    =   8  π   Φ     k  a     k  b         superscript  G    a  b      8  π  normal-Φ   superscript  k  a    superscript  k  b      G^{ab}=8\pi\Phi\,k^{a}\,k^{b}   where    k  →     normal-→  k    \vec{k}   is a null vector field. This definition makes sense in the absence of any physical interpretation, but if we place a stress–energy tensor on our spacetime which happens to have the form     T   a  b    =    Φ     k  a     k  b         superscript  T    a  b      normal-Φ   superscript  k  a    superscript  k  b      T^{ab}=\Phi\,k^{a}\,k^{b}   then Einstein's field equation is trivially satisfied, and in addition, such a stress–energy tensor has a clear physical interpretation in terms of massless radiation. The vector field specifies the direction in which the radiation is moving; the scalar multiplier specifies its intensity.  Physical interpretation  Physically speaking, a null dust describes either gravitational radiation , or some kind of nongravitational radiation which is described by a relativistic  classical field theory (such as electromagnetic radiation ), or a combination of these two. Null dusts include vacuum solutions as a special case.  Phenomena which can be modeled by null dust solutions include:   a beam of neutrinos assumed for simplicity to be massless (treated according to classical physics),  a very high-frequency electromagnetic wave,  a beam of incoherent electromagnetic radiation.   In particular, a plane wave of incoherent electromagnetic radiation is a linear superposition of plane waves, all moving in the same direction but having randomly chosen phases and frequencies. (Even though the Einstein field equation is nonlinear, a linear superposition of comoving plane waves is possible.) Here, each electromagnetic plane wave has a well defined frequency and phase, but the superposition does not. Individual electromagnetic plane waves are modeled by null electrovacuum solutions , while an incoherent mixture can be modeled by a null dust.  Einstein tensor  The components of a tensor computed with respect to a frame field rather than the coordinate basis are often called physical components , because these are the components which can (in principle) be measured by an observer.  In the case of a null dust solution, an adapted frame        e  →   0   ,    e  →   1   ,    e  →   2   ,    e  →   3       subscript   normal-→  e   0    subscript   normal-→  e   1    subscript   normal-→  e   2    subscript   normal-→  e   3     \vec{e}_{0},\;\vec{e}_{1},\;\vec{e}_{2},\;\vec{e}_{3}   (a timelike unit vector field and three spacelike unit vector fields, respectively) can always be found in which the Einstein tensor has a particularly simple appearance:       G    a  ^    b  ^     =   8  π   ϵ    [     1    0    0     ±  1       0    0    0    0      0    0    0    0       ±  1     0    0    1     ]         superscript  G     normal-^  a    normal-^  b       8  π  ϵ   delimited-[]    1  0  0   plus-or-minus  1     0  0  0  0    0  0  0  0     plus-or-minus  1   0  0  1        G^{\hat{a}\hat{b}}=8\pi\epsilon\,\left[\begin{matrix}1&0&0&\pm 1\\
 0&0&0&0\\
 0&0&0&0\\
 \pm 1&0&0&1\end{matrix}\right]   Here,     e  →   0     subscript   normal-→  e   0    \vec{e}_{0}   is everywhere tangent to the world lines of our adapted observers , and these observers measure the energy density of the incoherent radiation to be   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   .  From the form of the general coordinate basis expression given above, it is apparent that the stress–energy tensor has precisely the same isotropy group as the null vector field    k  →     normal-→  k    \vec{k}   . It is generated by two parabolic Lorentz transformations (pointing in the     e  →   3     subscript   normal-→  e   3    \vec{e}_{3}   direction) and one rotation (about the     e  →   3     subscript   normal-→  e   3    \vec{e}_{3}   axis), and it is isometric to the three-dimensional Lie group    E   (  2  )       E  2    E(2)   , the isometry group of the euclidean plane.  Examples  Null dust solutions include two large and important families of exact solutions:   pp-wave spacetimes (which model generalizations of the plane waves familiar from electromagnetism ),  Robinson–Trautman null dusts (which model radiation expanding from a radiating object).   The pp-waves include the gravitational plane waves and the monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave . A specific example of considerable interest is   the Bonnor beam , an exact solution modeling an infinitely long beam of light surrounded by a vacuum region.   Robinson–Trautman null dusts include the Kinnersley–Walker photon rocket solutions, which include the Vaidya null dust , which includes the Schwarzschild vacuum .
