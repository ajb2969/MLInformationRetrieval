Dexter electron transfer

 Dexter electron transfer (also called Dexter electron exchange and Dexter energy transfer) is a fluorescence quenching mechanism in which an excited electron is transferred from one molecule (a donor) to a second molecule (an acceptor) via a non radiative path.12 This process requires a wavefunction overlap between the donor and acceptor,3 which means it can only occur at short distances; typically within 10 Å.4 The excited state may be exchanged in a single step, or in two separate charge exchange steps.
The Dexter energy transfer rate, 
 
 
 
 , is indicated by the proportionality



where 
 
 
 
  is the separation of the donor from the acceptor, 
 
 
 
  is the sum of the Van der Waals radii of the donor and the acceptor, and 
 
 
 
  is the spectral overlap integral defined by



This short range energy transfer process was first theoretically proposed by D. L. Dexter in 1951.5
