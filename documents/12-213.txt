   Dexter electron transfer      Dexter electron transfer    Dexter electron transfer (also called Dexter electron exchange and Dexter energy transfer ) is a fluorescence  quenching mechanism in which an excited  electron is transferred from one molecule (a donor ) to a second molecule (an acceptor ) via a non radiative path. 1 2 This process requires a wavefunction overlap between the donor and acceptor, 3 which means it can only occur at short distances; typically within 10 Å. 4 The excited state may be exchanged in a single step, or in two separate charge exchange steps.  The Dexter energy transfer rate,    k   E  T      subscript  k    E  T     k_{ET}   , is indicated by the proportionality       k   E  T    ∝   J  exp   [    -   2  r    L   ]       proportional-to   subscript  k    E  T      J  exp   delimited-[]        2  r    L       k_{ET}\varpropto J\mathrm{exp}\left[\frac{-2r}{L}\right]     where   r   r   r   is the separation of the donor from the acceptor,   L   L   L   is the sum of the Van der Waals radii of the donor and the acceptor, and   J   J   J   is the spectral overlap integral defined by      J  =   ∫    f  D    (  λ  )    ϵ  A    (  λ  )     λ  4    d  λ        J       subscript  f  normal-D   λ   subscript  ϵ  normal-A   λ   superscript  λ  4   d  λ      J=\int f_{\rm D}(\lambda)\,\epsilon_{\rm A}(\lambda)\,\lambda^{4}\,d\lambda     This short range energy transfer process was first theoretically proposed by D. L. Dexter in 1951. 5  See also   Fluorescence  Quenching  Förster resonance energy transfer  Surface energy transfer   References  "  Category:Atomic physics  Category:Fluorescence     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
