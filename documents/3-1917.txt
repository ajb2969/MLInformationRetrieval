Hendecagon

In geometry, a hendecagon (also undecagon12 or endecagon3) is an 11-sided polygon. (The name hendecagon, from Greek hendeka "eleven" and gon– "corner", is often preferred to the hybrid undecagon, whose first part is formed from Latin undecim "eleven".4)
A regular hendecagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {11}.
Regular hendecagon
A regular hendecagon has internal angles of 147.27 degrees.5 The area of a regular hendecagon with side length a is given by6



A regular hendecagon is not constructible with compass and straightedge.7 Because 11 is not a Pierpont prime, construction of a regular hendecagon is still impossible even with the usage of an angle trisector.
Close approximations to the regular hendecagon can be constructed, however. For instance, the ancient Greek mathematicians approximated the side length of a hendecagon inscribed in a unit circle as being 14/25 units long.8
Use in coinage
The Canadian dollar coin, the loonie, is similar to, but not exactly, a regular hendecagonal prism,9 as are the Indian 2-rupee coin10 and several other lesser-used coins of other nations.11 The cross-section of a loonie is actually a Reuleaux hendecagon. The United States Susan B. Anthony dollar has a hendecagonal outline along the inside of its edges.
Related figures
The hendecagon shares the same set of 11 vertices with four regular hendecagrams:
