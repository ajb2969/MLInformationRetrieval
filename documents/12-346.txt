   Affine Grassmannian      Affine Grassmannian   In mathematics , the term affine Grassmannian has two distinct meanings; the concept treated in this article is the affine Grassmannian of an algebraic group  G over a field k . It is an ind-scheme —a limit of finite-dimensional schemes —which can be thought of as a flag variety for the loop group G(k((t))) and which describes the representation theory of the Langlands dual group L G through what is known as the geometric Satake correspondence .  Definition of Gr via functor of points  Let k be a field, and denote by    k  -  Alg      k  Alg    k-\mathrm{Alg}   and   Set   Set   \mathrm{Set}   the category of commutative k -algebras and the category of sets respectively. Through the Yoneda lemma , a scheme X over a field k is determined by its functor of points , which is the functor    X  :    k  -  Alg   →  Set      normal-:  X   normal-→    k  Alg   Set     X:k-\mathrm{Alg}\to\mathrm{Set}   which takes A to the set X(A) of A -points of X . We then say that this functor is representable by the scheme X . The affine Grassmannian is a functor from k -algebras to sets which is not itself representable, but which has a filtration by representable functors. As such, although it is not a scheme, it may be thought of as a union of schemes, and this is enough to profitably apply geometric methods to study it.  Let G be an algebraic group over k . The affine Grassmannian Gr G is the functor that associates to a k -algebra A the set of isomorphism classes of pairs ( E , φ ), where E is a principal homogeneous space for G over Spec A [ [ t ]] and φ is an isomorphism, defined over Spec A (( t )), of E with the trivial G -bundle G × Spec A (( t )). By the Beauville–Laszlo theorem , it is also possible to specify this data by fixing an algebraic curve  X over k , a k -point x on X , and taking E to be a G -bundle on X A and φ a trivialization on ( X − x ) A . When G is a reductive group , Gr G is in fact ind-projective, i.e., an inductive limit of projective schemes.  Definition as a coset space  Let us denote by    𝒦  =   k   (   (  t  )   )        𝒦    k  t     \mathcal{K}=k((t))   the field of formal Laurent series over k , and by    𝒪  =   k   [   [  t  ]   ]        𝒪    k   delimited-[]   delimited-[]  t       \mathcal{O}=k[[t]]   the ring of formal power series over k . By choosing a trivialization of E over all of Spec   𝒪   𝒪   \mathcal{O}   , the set of k -points of Gr G is identified with the coset space      G   (  𝒦  )    /  G    (  𝒪  )           G  𝒦   G   𝒪    G(\mathcal{K})/G(\mathcal{O})   .
