Thermal conductance quantum

In physics, the thermal conductance quantum

 
  describes the rate at which heat is transported through a single ballistic phonon channel. It is given by:


 
 .
The thermal conductance of any electrically insulating structure that exhibits ballistic phonon transport is a positive integer multiple of 
 
 
 
 . The thermal conductance quantum was first measured in 2000.1 These measurements employed suspended silicon nitride nanostructures that exhibited a constant thermal conductance of 16
 
 
 
  at temperatures below approximately 0.6 kelvin.
For ballistic electrical conductors, the electron contribution to the thermal conductance is also quantized as a result of the electrical conductance quantum and the Wiedemann–Franz law.
