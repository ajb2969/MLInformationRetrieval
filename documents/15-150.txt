   Thermal conductance quantum      Thermal conductance quantum   In physics, the thermal conductance quantum     g  0     subscript  g  0    g_{0}   describes the rate at which heat is transported through a single ballistic  phonon channel. It is given by:       g  0   =     π  2    k  B    2   T    3  h    ≈    (     9.456  ×   10   -  13     W   /   K  2    )   T          subscript  g  0        superscript  π  2    superscript   subscript  k  B   2   T     3  h                 9.456   superscript  10    13     W    superscript  K  2    T      g_{0}=\frac{\pi^{2}{k_{B}}^{2}T}{3h}\approx(9.456\times 10^{-13}W/K^{2})T   .  The thermal conductance of any electrically insulating structure that exhibits ballistic phonon transport is a positive integer multiple of    g  0     subscript  g  0    g_{0}   . The thermal conductance quantum was first measured in 2000. 1 These measurements employed suspended silicon nitride nanostructures that exhibited a constant thermal conductance of 16    g  0     subscript  g  0    g_{0}   at temperatures below approximately 0.6 kelvin .  For ballistic electrical conductors, the electron contribution to the thermal conductance is also quantized as a result of the electrical conductance quantum and the Wiedemann–Franz law .
