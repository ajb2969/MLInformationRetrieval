3-dehydrosphinganine reductase

3-dehydrosphinganine reductase () also known as 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase (KDSR) or follicular variant translocation protein 1 (FVT1) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the KDSR gene.12345
Function
3-dehydrosphinganine reductase catalyzes the chemical reaction:

sphinganine + NADP+

 
  3-dehydrosphinganine + NADPH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sphinganine and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are 3-dehydrosphinganine, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. This enzyme participates in sphingolipid metabolism.
Tissue distribution
Follicular lymphoma variant translocation 1 is a secreted protein which is weakly expressed in hematopoietic tissue.
Clinical significance
FVT1 shows a high rate of transcription in some T cell malignancies and in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes. The proximity of FVT1 to BCL2 suggests that it may participate in the tumoral process.6
