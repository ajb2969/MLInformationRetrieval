   Scleronomous      Scleronomous   A mechanical system is scleronomous if the equations of constraints do not contain the time as an explicit variable. Such constraints are called scleronomic constraints.  Application   Main article： Generalized velocity    In 3-D space, a particle with mass   m   m   m\,\!   , velocity   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}\,\!   has kinetic energy       T  =    1  2   m   v  2     .      T      1  2   m   superscript  v  2      T=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\,\!.     Velocity is the derivative of position with respect time. Use chain rule for several variables :       𝐯  =    d  𝐫    d  t    =      ∑  i       ∂  𝐫    ∂   q  i       q  ˙   i     +    ∂  𝐫    ∂  t      .        𝐯      d  𝐫     d  t             subscript   i         𝐫      subscript  q  i      subscript   normal-˙  q   i         𝐫     t        \mathbf{v}=\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}=\sum_{i}\ \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial

 _{i}+\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial t}\right)^{2}\,\!.     Rearranging the terms carefully, 1       T  =    T  0   +   T  1   +   T  2     :      normal-:    T     subscript  T  0    subscript  T  1    subscript  T  2     absent    T=T_{0}+T_{1}+T_{2}\,\!:           T  0   =    1  2   m    (    ∂  𝐫    ∂  t    )   2     ,       subscript  T  0       1  2   m   superscript      𝐫     t    2      T_{0}=\frac{1}{2}m\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial t}\right)^{2}\,\!,           T  1   =     ∑  i       m    ∂  𝐫    ∂  t     ⋅    ∂  𝐫    ∂   q  i        q  ˙   i      ,       subscript  T  1     subscript   i      normal-⋅    m      𝐫     t         𝐫      subscript  q  i       subscript   normal-˙  q   i       T_{1}=\sum_{i}\ m\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial t}\cdot\frac{\partial%
 \mathbf{r}}{\partial q_{i}}\dot{q}_{i}\,\!,           T  2   =     ∑   i  ,  j         1  2   m    ∂  𝐫    ∂   q  i      ⋅    ∂  𝐫    ∂   q  j        q  ˙   i     q  ˙   j      ,       subscript  T  2     subscript    i  j       normal-⋅      1  2   m      𝐫      subscript  q  i          𝐫      subscript  q  j       subscript   normal-˙  q   i    subscript   normal-˙  q   j       T_{2}=\sum_{i,j}\ \frac{1}{2}m\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial q_{i}}\cdot%
 \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial q_{j}}\dot{q}_{i}\dot{q}_{j}\,\!,     where    T  0     subscript  T  0    T_{0}\,\!   ,    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}\,\!   ,    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}\,\!   are respectively homogeneous functions of degree 0, 1, and 2 in generalized velocities. If this system is scleronomous, then the position does not depend explicitly with time:         ∂  𝐫    ∂  t    =  0   .          𝐫     t    0    \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial t}=0\,\!.   Therefore, only term    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}\,\!   does not vanish:       T  =   T  2    .      T   subscript  T  2     T=T_{2}\,\!.   Kinetic energy is a homogeneous function of degree 2 in generalized velocities .  Example: pendulum  As shown at right, a simple pendulum is a system composed of a weight and a string. The string is attached at the top end to a pivot and at the bottom end to a weight. Being inextensible, the string’s length is a constant. Therefore, this system is scleronomous; it obeys scleronomic constraint           x  2   +   y  2     -  L   =  0   ,             superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2     L   0    \sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}-L=0\,\!,     where    (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,y)\,\!   is the position of the weight and   L   L   L\,\!   is length of the string.  Take a more complicated example. Refer to the next figure at right, Assume the top end of the string is attached to a pivot point undergoing a simple harmonic motion        x  t   =    x  0    cos   ω  t      ,       subscript  x  t      subscript  x  0       ω  t       x_{t}=x_{0}\cos\omega t\,\!,     where    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}\,\!   is amplitude,   ω   ω   \omega\,\!   is angular frequency, and   t   t   t\,\!   is time.  Although the top end of the string is not fixed, the length of this inextensible string is still a constant. The distance between the top end and the weight must stay the same. Therefore, this system is rheonomous as it obeys constraint explicitly dependent on time            (   x  -    x  0    cos   ω  t      )   2   +   y  2     -  L   =  0   .             superscript    x     subscript  x  0       ω  t      2    superscript  y  2     L   0    \sqrt{(x-x_{0}\cos\omega t)^{2}+y^{2}}-L=0\,\!.
