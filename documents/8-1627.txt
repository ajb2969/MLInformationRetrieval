Scleronomous

A mechanical system is scleronomous if the equations of constraints do not contain the time as an explicit variable. Such constraints are called scleronomic constraints.
Application

Main article：Generalized velocity


In 3-D space, a particle with mass 
 
 
 
 , velocity 
 
 
 
  has kinetic energy



Velocity is the derivative of position with respect time. Use chain rule for several variables:



Therefore,



Rearranging the terms carefully,1












where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are respectively homogeneous functions of degree 0, 1, and 2 in generalized velocities. If this system is scleronomous, then the position does not depend explicitly with time:


 
  Therefore, only term 
 
 
 
  does not vanish:


 
  Kinetic energy is a homogeneous function of degree 2 in generalized velocities .
Example: pendulum
 As shown at right, a simple pendulum is a system composed of a weight and a string. The string is attached at the top end to a pivot and at the bottom end to a weight. Being inextensible, the string’s length is a constant. Therefore, this system is scleronomous; it obeys scleronomic constraint



where 
 
 
 
  is the position of the weight and 
 
 
 
  is length of the string.
 Take a more complicated example. Refer to the next figure at right, Assume the top end of the string is attached to a pivot point undergoing a simple harmonic motion



where 
 
 
 
  is amplitude, 
 
 
 
  is angular frequency, and 
 
 
 
  is time.
Although the top end of the string is not fixed, the length of this inextensible string is still a constant. The distance between the top end and the weight must stay the same. Therefore, this system is rheonomous as it obeys constraint explicitly dependent on time
