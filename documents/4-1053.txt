   Subspace topology      Subspace topology   In topology and related areas of mathematics , a subspace of a topological space  X is a subset  S of X which is equipped with a topology induced from that of X called the subspace topology (or the relative topology , or the induced topology , or the trace topology ).  Definition  Given a topological space    (  X  ,  τ  )     X  τ    (X,\tau)   and a subset    S   S   S   of   X   X   X   , the subspace topology on   S   S   S   is defined by        τ  S   =   {   S  ∩  U   ∣   U  ∈  τ   }    .       subscript  τ  S    conditional-set    S  U     U  τ      \tau_{S}=\{S\cap U\mid U\in\tau\}.   That is, a subset of   S   S   S   is open in the subspace topology if and only if it is the intersection of   S   S   S   with an open set in    (  X  ,  τ  )     X  τ    (X,\tau)   . If   S   S   S   is equipped with the subspace topology then it is a topological space in its own right, and is called a subspace of    (  X  ,  τ  )     X  τ    (X,\tau)   . Subsets of topological spaces are usually assumed to be equipped with the subspace topology unless otherwise stated.  Alternatively we can define the subspace topology for a subset   S   S   S   of   X   X   X   as the coarsest topology for which the inclusion map      ι  :   S  ↪  X      normal-:  ι   normal-↪  S  X     \iota:S\hookrightarrow X   is continuous .  More generally, suppose   ι   ι   \iota   is an injection from a set   S   S   S   to a topological space   X   X   X   . Then the subspace topology on   S   S   S   is defined as the coarsest topology for which   ι   ι   \iota   is continuous. The open sets in this topology are precisely the ones of the form     ι   -  1     (  U  )        superscript  ι    1    U    \iota^{-1}(U)   for   U   U   U   open in   X   X   X   .   S   S   S   is then homeomorphic to its image in   X   X   X   (also with the subspace topology) and   ι   ι   \iota   is called a topological embedding .  A subspace   S   S   S   is called an open subspace if the injection   ι   ι   \iota   is an open map , i.e., if the forward image of an open set of   S   S   S   is open in   X   X   X   . Likewise it is called a closed subspace if the injection   ι   ι   \iota   is a closed map .  A Note About Terminology  The distinction between a set and a topological space is often blurred notationally, for convenience, which can be a source of confusion when one first encounters these definitions. Thus, whenever   S   S   S   is a subset of   X   X   X   , and    (  X  ,  τ  )     X  τ    (X,\tau)   is a topological space, then the unadorned symbols "   S   S   S   " and "   X   X   X   " can often be used to refer both to   S   S   S   and   X   X   X   considered as two subsets of   X   X   X   , and also to    (  S  ,   τ  S   )     S   subscript  τ  S     (S,\tau_{S})   and    (  X  ,  τ  )     X  τ    (X,\tau)   as the topological spaces, related as discussed above. So phrases such as "   S   S   S   an open subspace of   X   X   X   " are used to mean that    (  S  ,   τ  S   )     S   subscript  τ  S     (S,\tau_{S})   is an open subspace of    (  X  ,  τ  )     X  τ    (X,\tau)   , in the sense used below -- that is that: (i)    S  ∈  τ      S  τ    S\in\tau   ; and (ii)   S   S   S   is considered to be endowed with the subspace topology.  Examples  In the following,   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   represents the real numbers with their usual topology.   The subspace topology of the natural numbers , as a subspace of   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   , is the discrete topology .  The rational numbers    ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   considered as a subspace of   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   do not have the discrete topology (the point 0 for example is not an open set in   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   ). If a and b are rational, then the intervals ( a , b ) and [ a , b ] are respectively open and closed, but if a and b are irrational, then the set of all x with a < x < b is both open and closed.  The set [0,1] as a subspace of   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   is both open and closed, whereas as a subset of   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   it is only closed.  As a subspace of   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   , [0, 1] ∪ [2, 3] is composed of two disjoint open subsets (which happen also to be closed), and is therefore a disconnected space .  Let S = [0, 1) be a subspace of the real line   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   . Then [0, 1/2) is open in S but not in   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   . Likewise [½, 1) is closed in S but not in   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   . S is both open and closed as a subset of itself but not as a subset of   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   .   Properties  The subspace topology has the following characteristic property. Let   Y   Y   Y   be a subspace of   X   X   X   and let    i  :   Y  →  X      normal-:  i   normal-→  Y  X     i:Y\to X   be the inclusion map. Then for any topological space   Z   Z   Z   a map    f  :   Z  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  Z  Y     f:Z\to Y   is continuous if and only if the composite map    i  ∘  f      i  f    i\circ f   is continuous.  This property is characteristic in the sense that it can be used to define the subspace topology on   Y   Y   Y   .  We list some further properties of the subspace topology. In the following let   S   S   S   be a subspace of   X   X   X   .   If    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   is continuous the restriction to   S   S   S   is continuous.  If    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   is continuous then    f  :   X  →   f   (  X  )        normal-:  f   normal-→  X    f  X      f:X\to f(X)   is continuous.  The closed sets in   S   S   S   are precisely the intersections of   S   S   S   with closed sets in   X   X   X   .  If   A   A   A   is a subspace of   S   S   S   then   A   A   A   is also a subspace of   X   X   X   with the same topology. In other words the subspace topology that   A   A   A   inherits from   S   S   S   is the same as the one it inherits from   X   X   X   .  Suppose   S   S   S   is an open subspace of   X   X   X   (so    S  ∈  τ      S  τ    S\in\tau   ). Then a subset of   S   S   S   is open in   S   S   S   if and only if it is open in   X   X   X   .  Suppose   S   S   S   is a closed subspace of   X   X   X   (so     X  ∖  S   ∈  τ        X  S   τ    X\setminus S\in\tau   ). Then a subset of   S   S   S   is closed in   S   S   S   if and only if it is closed in   X   X   X   .  If   B   B   B   is a basis for   X   X   X   then     B  S   =   {   U  ∩  S   :   U  ∈  B   }        subscript  B  S    conditional-set    U  S     U  B      B_{S}=\{U\cap S:U\in B\}   is a basis for   S   S   S   .  The topology induced on a subset of a metric space by restricting the metric to this subset coincides with subspace topology for this subset.   Preservation of topological properties  If a topological space having some topological property implies its subspaces have that property, then we say the property is hereditary . If only closed subspaces must share the property we call it weakly hereditary .   Every open and every closed subspace of a completely metrizable space is completely metrizable.  Every open subspace of a Baire space is a Baire space.  Every closed subspace of a compact space is compact.  Being a Hausdorff space is hereditary.  Being a normal space is weakly hereditary.  Total boundedness is hereditary.  Being totally disconnected is hereditary.  First countability and second countability are hereditary.
