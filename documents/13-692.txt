Fractional Schrödinger equation




Fractional Schrödinger equation

The fractional Schrödinger equation is a fundamental equation of fractional quantum mechanics. It was discovered by Nick Laskin (1999) as a result of extending the Feynman path integral, from the Brownian-like to Lévy-like quantum mechanical paths. The term fractional Schrödinger equation was coined by Nick Laskin.1
Fundamentals
The fractional Schrödinger equation in the form originally obtained by Nick Laskin is:2

r is the 3-dimensional position vector,
ħ is the reduced Planck constant,
ψ(r, t) is the wavefunction, which is the quantum mechanical probability amplitude for the particle to have a given position r at any given time t,
V(r, t) is a potential energy,
Δ = ∂2/∂r2 is the Laplace operator.

Further,

Dα is a scale constant with physical dimension [Dα] = [energy]1 − α·[length]α[time]−α, at α = 2, D2 =1/2m, where m is a particle mass,
the operator (−ħ2Δ)α/2 is the 3-dimensional fractional quantum Riesz derivative defined by (see, Ref.[2]);







(-\hbar ^2\Delta )^{\alpha /2}\psi (\mathbf{r},t)=\frac 1{(2\pi \hbar )^3}\int d^3pe^{i\frac{\mathbf{pr}}\hbar }|\mathbf{p}|^\alpha \varphi ( \mathbf{p},t), 
Here, the wave functions in the position and momentum spaces; 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are related each other by the 3-dimensional Fourier transforms:



The index α in the fractional Schrödinger equation is the Lévy index, 1 S. G. Samko, A. A. Kilbas, and O. I. Marichev, Fractional Integrals and Derivatives, Theory and Applications ~Gordon and Breach, Amsterdam, 1993 This is the main point of the term fractional Schrödinger equation or a more general term fractional quantum mechanics.3 At α = 2 fractional Schrödinger equation becomes the well-known Schrödinger equation.
The fractional Schrödinger equation has the following operator form
where the fractional Hamilton operator 
 
 
 
  is given by



The Hamilton operator, 
 
 
 
  corresponds to the classical mechanics Hamiltonian function introduced by Nick Laskin



where p and r are the momentum and the position vectors respectively.
Time-independent fractional Schrödinger equation
The special case when the Hamiltonian 
 
 
 
  is independent of time


 
  is of great importance for physical applications. It is easy to see that in this case there exist the special solution of the fractional Schrödinger equation


 
  where 
 
 
 
  satisfies



or



This is the time-independent fractional Schrödinger equation (see, Ref.[2]).
Thus, we see that the wave function

 
  oscillates with a definite frequency. In classical physics the frequency corresponds to the energy. Therefore, the quantum mechanical state has a definite energy E. The probability to find a particle at 
 
 
 
  is the absolute square of the wave function 
 
 
 
  Because of time-independent fractional Schrödinger equation this is equal to 
 
 
 
  and does not depend upon the time. That is, the probability of finding the particle at 
 
 
 
  is independent of the time. One can say that the system is in a stationary state. In other words, there is no variation in the probabilities as a function of time.
Probability current density
The conservation law of fractional quantum mechanical probability has been discovered for the first time by D.A.Tayurskii and Yu.V. Lysogorski 4



where 
 
 
 
  is the quantum mechanical probability density and the vector 
 
 
 
  can be called by the fractional probability current density vector



and



here we use the notation (see also matrix calculus)
 
 
 
 .
It has been found in Ref.[5] that there are quantum physical conditions when the new term 
 
 
 
  is negligible and we come to the continuity equation for quantum probability current and quantum density (see, Ref.[2]):



Introducing the momentum operator

 
  we can write the vector 
 
 
 
  in the form (see, Ref.[2])



This is fractional generalization of the well-known equation for probability current density vector of standard quantum mechanics (see, Ref.[7]).
Velocity operator
The quantum mechanical velocity operator 
 
 
 
  is defined as follows:



Straightforward calculation results in (see, Ref.[2])



Hence,



To get the probability current density equal to 1 (the current when one particle passes through unit area per unit time) the wave function of a free particle has to be normalized as



where 
 
 
 
  is the particle velocity, 
 
 
 
 .
Then we have



that is, the vector 
 
 
 
  is indeed the unit vector.
Physical applications
Fractional Bohr atom
When 
 
 
 
  is the potential energy of hydrogenlike atom,



where e is the electron charge and Z is the atomic number of the hydrogenlike atom, (so Ze is the nuclear charge of the atom), we come to following fractional eigenvalue problem,



This eigenvalue problem has first been solved by Nick Laskin in.5
Using the first Niels Bohr postulate yields



and it gives us the equation for the Bohr radius of the fractional hydrogenlike atom



Here a0 is the fractional Bohr radius (the radius of the lowest, n = 1, Bohr orbit) defined as,



The energy levels of the fractional hydrogenlike atom are given by



where E0 is the binding energy of the electron in the lowest Bohr orbit that is, the energy required to put it in a state with E = 0 corresponding to n = ∞,



The energy (α − 1)E0 divided by ħc, (α − 1)E0/ħc, can be considered as fractional generalization of the Rydberg constant of standard quantum mechanics. For α = 2 and Z = 1 the formula 
 
 
 
  is transformed into


 
 , which is the well-known expression for the Rydberg formula.
According to the second Niels Bohr postulate, the frequency of radiation 
 
 
 
  associated with the transition, say, for example from the orbit m to the orbit n, is,


 
 .
The above equations are fractional generalization of the Bohr model. In the special Gaussian case, when (α = 2) those equations give us the well-known results of the Bohr model.6
The infinite potential well
A particle in a one-dimensional well moves in a potential field 
 
 
 
 , which is zero for 
 
 
 
  and which is infinite elsewhere,









It is evident a priori that the energy spectrum will be discrete. The solution of the fractional Schrödinger equation for the stationary state with well-defined energy E is described by a wave function 
 
 
 
 , which can be written as


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
 , is now time independent. In regions (i) and (iii), the fractional Schrödinger equation can be satisfied only if we take 
 
 
 
 . In the middle region (ii), the time-independent fractional Schrödinger equation is (see, Ref.[5]).



This equation defines the wave functions and the energy spectrum within region (ii), while outside of the region (ii), xa, the wave functions are zero. The wave function 
 
 
 
  has to be continuous everywhere, thus we impose the boundary conditions 
 
 
 
  for the solutions of the time-independent fractional Schrödinger equation (see, Ref.[5]). Then the solution in region (ii) can be written as



To satisfy the boundary conditions we have to choose



and



It follows from the last equation that



Then the even (
 
 
 
  under reflection 
 
 
 
 ) solution of the time-independent fractional Schrödinger equation 
 
 
 
  in the infinite potential well is



The odd (
 
 
 
  under reflection 
 
 
 
 ) solution of the time-independent fractional Schrödinger equation 
 
 
 
  in the infinite potential well is



The solutions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have the property that



where 
 
 
 
  is the Kronecker symbol and



The eigenvalues of the particle in an infinite potential well are (see, Ref.[5])



It is obvious that in the Gaussian case (α = 2) above equations are transformed into the standard quantum mechanical equations for a particle in a box (for example, see Eq.(20.7) in 7)
The state of the lowest energy, the ground state, in the infinite potential well is represented by the 
 
 
 
  at n=1,



and its energy is



Fractional quantum oscillator
Fractional quantum oscillator introduced by Nick Laskin (see, Ref.[2]) is the fractional quantum mechanical model with the Hamiltonian operator

 
  defined as


 
 ,
where q is interaction constant.
The fractional Schrödinger equation for the wave function 
 
 
 
  of the fractional quantum oscillator is,



Aiming to search for solution in form



we come to the time-independent fractional Schrödinger equation,



The Hamiltonian 
 
 
 
  is the fractional generalization of the 3D quantum harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian of standard quantum mechanics.
Energy levels of the 1D fractional quantum oscillator in semiclassical approximation
The energy levels of 1D fractional quantum oscillator with the Hamiltonian function

 
  were found in semiclassical approximation by Nick Laskin (2002) (see, Ref.[2]).
We set the total energy equal to E, so that



whence


 
 .
At the turning points 
 
 
 
 . Hence, the classical motion is possible in the range 
 
 
 
 .
A routine use of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule yields



where the notation 
 
 
 
  means the integral over one complete period of the classical motion and 
 
 
 
  is the turning point of classical motion.
To evaluate the integral in the right hand we introduce a new variable 
 
 
 
 . Then we have



The integral over dy can be expressed in terms of the Beta-function,



Therefore



The above equation gives the energy levels of stationary states for the 1D fractional quantum oscillator (see, Ref.[2]),



This equation is generalization of the well-known energy levels equation of the standard quantum harmonic oscillator (see, Ref.[7]) and is transformed into it at α = 2 and β = 2. It follows from this equation that at 
 
 
 
  the energy levels are equidistant. When 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  the equidistant energy levels can be for α = 2 and β = 2 only. It means that the only standard quantum harmonic oscillator has an equidistant energy spectrum.
