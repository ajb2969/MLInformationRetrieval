   Segre cubic      Segre cubic   In algebraic geometry , the Segre cubic is a cubic threefold embedded in 4 (or sometimes 5) dimensional projective space , studied by .  The Segre cubic is the set of points ( x 0 : x 1 : x 2 : x 3 : x 4 : x 5 ) of P 5 satisfying the equations        x  0   +   x  1   +   x  2   +   x  3   +   x  4   +   x  5    =  0         subscript  x  0    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3    subscript  x  4    subscript  x  5    0    \displaystyle x_{0}+x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+x_{4}+x_{5}=0           x  0  3   +   x  1  3   +   x  2  3   +   x  3  3   +   x  4  3   +   x  5  3    =  0.         superscript   subscript  x  0   3    superscript   subscript  x  1   3    superscript   subscript  x  2   3    superscript   subscript  x  3   3    superscript   subscript  x  4   3    superscript   subscript  x  5   3    0.    \displaystyle x_{0}^{3}+x_{1}^{3}+x_{2}^{3}+x_{3}^{3}+x_{4}^{3}+x_{5}^{3}=0.     Its intersection with any hyperplane x i = 0 is the Clebsch cubic surface . Its intersection with any hyperplane x i = x j is Cayley's nodal cubic surface . Its dual is the Igusa quartic 3-fold in P 4 . Its Hessian is the Barth–Nieto quintic . A cubic hypersurface in P 4 has at most 10 nodes, and up to isomorphism the Segre cubic is the unique one with 10 nodes. Its nodes are the points conjugate to (1:1:1:−1:−1:−1) under permutations of coordinates.  References       "  Category:Threefolds
