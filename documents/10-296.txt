   Babuška–Lax–Milgram theorem      Babuška–Lax–Milgram theorem   In mathematics , the Babuška–Lax–Milgram theorem is a generalization of the famous Lax–Milgram theorem , which gives conditions under which a bilinear form can be "inverted" to show the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to a given boundary value problem . The result is named after the mathematicians  Ivo Babuška , Peter Lax and Arthur Milgram .  Background  In the modern, functional-analytic approach to the study of partial differential equations , one does not attempt to solve a given partial differential equation directly, but by using the structure of the vector space of possible solutions, e.g. a Sobolev space  W k , p . Abstractly, consider two real  normed spaces  U and V with their continuous dual spaces  U ∗ and V ∗ respectively. In many applications, U is the space of possible solutions; given some partial differential operator Λ : U → V ∗ and a specified element f ∈ V ∗ , the objective is to find a u ∈ U such that        Λ  u   =  f   .        normal-Λ  u   f    \Lambda u=f.     However, in the weak formulation , this equation is only required to hold when "tested" against all other possible elements of V . This "testing" is accomplished by means of a bilinear function B : U × V → R which encodes the differential operator Λ; a weak solution to the problem is to find a u ∈ U such that        B   (  u  ,  v  )    =    ⟨  f  ,  v  ⟩   for all  v   ∈  V   .          B   u  v       f  v   for all  v        V     B(u,v)=\langle f,v\rangle\mbox{ for all }v\in V.     The achievement of Lax and Milgram in their 1954 result was to specify sufficient conditions for this weak formulation to have a unique solution that depends continuously upon the specified datum f ∈ V ∗ : it suffices that U = V is a Hilbert space , that B is continuous, and that B is strongly coercive , i.e.       |   B   (  u  ,  u  )    |   ≥   c    ∥  u  ∥   2            B   u  u       c   superscript   norm  u   2      |B(u,u)|\geq c\|u\|^{2}     for some constant c > 0 and all u ∈ U .  For example, in the solution of the Poisson equation on a bounded , open domain Ω ⊂ R n ,      {        -   Δ  u   (  x  )     =   f   (  x  )     ,       x  ∈  Ω   ;          u   (  x  )    =  0   ,       x  ∈   ∂  Ω    ;         cases        normal-Δ  u  x      f  x      x  normal-Ω       u  x   0     x    normal-Ω      \begin{cases}-\Delta u(x)=f(x),&x\in\Omega;\\
 u(x)=0,&x\in\partial\Omega;\end{cases}     the space U could be taken to be the Sobolev space H 0 1 (Ω) with dual H −1 (Ω); the former is a subspace of the L p space  V = L 2 (Ω); the bilinear form B associated to −Δ is the L 2 (Ω) inner product of the derivatives:        B   (  u  ,  v  )    =    ∫  Ω       ∇  u    (  x  )    ⋅   ∇  v     (  x  )   d  x     .        B   u  v      subscript   normal-Ω      normal-⋅     normal-∇  u   x    normal-∇  v    x  normal-d  x      B(u,v)=\int_{\Omega}\nabla u(x)\cdot\nabla v(x)\,\mathrm{d}x.     Hence, the weak formulation of the Poisson equation, given f ∈ L 2 (Ω), is to find u f such that         ∫  Ω       ∇   u  f     (  x  )    ⋅   ∇  v     (  x  )   d  x    =    ∫  Ω    f   (  x  )   v   (  x  )   d  x  for all  v    ∈    H  0  1    (  Ω  )     .          subscript   normal-Ω      normal-⋅     normal-∇   subscript  u  f    x    normal-∇  v    x  normal-d  x      subscript   normal-Ω     f  x  v  x  normal-d  x  for all  v            superscript   subscript  H  0   1   normal-Ω      \int_{\Omega}\nabla u_{f}(x)\cdot\nabla v(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=\int_{\Omega}f(x)v(x%

Statement of the theorem  In 1971, Babuška provided the following generalization of Lax and Milgram's earlier result, which begins by dispensing with the requirement that U and V be the same space. Let U and V be two real Hilbert spaces and let B : U × V → R be a continuous bilinear functional. Suppose also that B is weakly coercive: for some constant c > 0 and all u ∈ U ,        sup    ∥  v  ∥   =  1     |   B   (  u  ,  v  )    |    ≥   c   ∥  u  ∥          subscript  supremum     norm  v   1        B   u  v        c   norm  u      \sup_{\|v\|=1}|B(u,v)|\geq c\|u\|     and, for all 0 ≠ v ∈ V ,        sup    ∥  u  ∥   =  1     |   B   (  u  ,  v  )    |    >  0        subscript  supremum     norm  u   1        B   u  v      0    \sup_{\|u\|=1}|B(u,v)|>0     Then, for all f ∈ V ∗ , there exists a unique solution u = u f ∈ U to the weak problem        B   (   u  f   ,  v  )    =    ⟨  f  ,  v  ⟩   for all  v   ∈  V   .          B    subscript  u  f   v       f  v   for all  v        V     B(u_{f},v)=\langle f,v\rangle\mbox{ for all }v\in V.     Moreover, the solution depends continuously on the given datum:        ∥   u  f   ∥   ≤    1  c    ∥  f  ∥     .       norm   subscript  u  f        1  c    norm  f      \|u_{f}\|\leq\frac{1}{c}\|f\|.
