   Smooth topology      Smooth topology   In algebraic geometry, the smooth topology is a certain Grothendieck topology , which is finer than étale topology . Its main use is to define the cohomology of an algebraic stack with coefficients in, say, the étale sheaf    ℚ  l     subscript  ℚ  l    \mathbb{Q}_{l}   .  To understand the problem that motivates the notion, consider the classifying stack     B   𝔾  m       B   subscript  𝔾  m     B\mathbb{G}_{m}   over    Spec   𝐅  q      Spec   subscript  𝐅  q     \operatorname{Spec}\mathbf{F}_{q}   . Then     B   𝔾  m    =   Spec   𝐅  q          B   subscript  𝔾  m     Spec   subscript  𝐅  q      B\mathbb{G}_{m}=\operatorname{Spec}\mathbf{F}_{q}   in the étale topology; 1 i.e., just a point. However, we expect the "correct" cohomology ring of    B   𝔾  m       B   subscript  𝔾  m     B\mathbb{G}_{m}   to be more like that of    ℂ   P  ∞       ℂ   superscript  P      \mathbb{C}P^{\infty}   as the ring should classify line bundles. Thus, the cohomology of    B   𝔾  m       B   subscript  𝔾  m     B\mathbb{G}_{m}   should be defined using smooth topology for formulae like Behrend's fixed point formula to hold.
