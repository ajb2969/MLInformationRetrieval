Smooth topology

In algebraic geometry, the smooth topology is a certain Grothendieck topology, which is finer than étale topology. Its main use is to define the cohomology of an algebraic stack with coefficients in, say, the étale sheaf 
 
 
 
 .
To understand the problem that motivates the notion, consider the classifying stack

 
  over 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 
  in the étale topology;1 i.e., just a point. However, we expect the "correct" cohomology ring of 
 
 
 
  to be more like that of 
 
 
 
  as the ring should classify line bundles. Thus, the cohomology of 
 
 
 
  should be defined using smooth topology for formulae like Behrend's fixed point formula to hold.

Unfortunately this book uses the incorrect assertion that morphisms of algebraic stacks induce morphisms of lisse-étale topoi. Some of these errors were fixed by .
