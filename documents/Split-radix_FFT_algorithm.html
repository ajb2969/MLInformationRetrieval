<h1>Split-radix FFT algorithm</h1>
<hr/>
<p>The <strong>split-radix FFT</strong> is a <a href="fast_Fourier_transform" title="wikilink">fast Fourier transform</a> (FFT) algorithm for computing the <a href="discrete_fourier_transform" title="wikilink">discrete fourier transform</a> (DFT), and was first described in an initially little-appreciated paper by <a href="R._Yavne" title="wikilink">R. Yavne</a> (1968) and subsequently rediscovered simultaneously by various authors in 1984. (The name "split radix" was coined by two of these reinventors, <a href="Pierre_Duhamel" title="wikilink">P. Duhamel</a> and <a href="Henk_D._L._Hollmann" title="wikilink">H. Hollmann</a>.) In particular, split radix is a variant of the <a href="Cooley-Tukey_FFT_algorithm" title="wikilink">Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm</a> that uses a blend of radices 2 and 4: it <a href="recursion" title="wikilink">recursively</a> expresses a DFT of length <em>N</em> in terms of one smaller DFT of length <em>N</em>/2 and two smaller DFTs of length <em>N</em>/4.</p>
<p>The split-radix FFT, along with its variations, long had the distinction of achieving the lowest published arithmetic operation count (total exact number of required <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real</a> additions and multiplications) to compute a DFT of <a href="power_of_two" title="wikilink">power-of-two</a> sizes <em>N</em>. The arithmetic count of the original split-radix algorithm was improved upon in 2004 (with the initial gains made in unpublished work by J. Van Buskirk via hand optimization for <em>N</em>=64 <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.dsp/msg/9e002292accb8a8b">1</a> <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~kmbtib/">2</a>), but it turns out that one can still achieve the new lowest count by a modification of split radix (Johnson and Frigo, 2007). Although the number of arithmetic operations is not the sole factor (or even necessarily the dominant factor) in determining the time required to compute a DFT on a <a class="uri" href="computer" title="wikilink">computer</a>, the question of the minimum possible count is of longstanding theoretical interest. (No tight lower bound on the operation count has currently been proven.)</p>
<p>The split-radix algorithm can only be applied when <em>N</em> is a multiple of 4, but since it breaks a DFT into smaller DFTs it can be combined with any other FFT algorithm as desired.</p>
<h2 id="split-radix-decomposition">Split-radix decomposition</h2>
<p>Recall that the DFT is defined by the formula:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$X_k =  \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \omega_N^{nk}$$</span> where <span class="LaTeX">$k$</span> is an integer ranging from <span class="LaTeX">$0$</span> to <span class="LaTeX">$N-1$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\omega_N$</span> denotes the primitive <a href="root_of_unity" title="wikilink">root of unity</a>:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\omega_N = e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{N}},$$</span> and thus <span class="LaTeX">$$\omega_N^N = 1$$</span>.</p>
<p>The split-radix algorithm works by expressing this summation in terms of three smaller summations. (Here, we give the "decimation in time" version of the split-radix FFT; the dual decimation in frequency version is essentially just the reverse of these steps.)</p>
<p>First, a summation over the <a href="even_and_odd_numbers" title="wikilink">even</a> indices <span class="LaTeX">$x_{2n_2}$</span>. Second, a summation over the odd indices broken into two pieces<span class="LaTeX">$$x_{4n_4+1}$$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$x_{4n_4+3}$</span>, according to whether the index is 1 or 3 <a href="modulo_operation" title="wikilink">modulo</a> 4. Here, <span class="LaTeX">$n_m$</span> denotes an index that runs from 0 to <span class="LaTeX">$N/m-1$</span>. The resulting summations look like:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$X_k =  \sum_{n_2=0}^{N/2-1} x_{2n_2} \omega_{N/2}^{n_2 k} 
+ \omega_N^k \sum_{n_4=0}^{N/4-1} x_{4n_4+1} \omega_{N/4}^{n_4 k}
+ \omega_N^{3k} \sum_{n_4=0}^{N/4-1} x_{4n_4+3} \omega_{N/4}^{n_4 k}$$</span></p>
<p>where we have used the fact that <span class="LaTeX">$\omega_N^{m n k} = \omega_{N/m}^{n k}$</span>. These three sums correspond to <em>portions</em> of <a href="Cooley-Tukey_FFT_algorithm#The_radix-2_DIT_case" title="wikilink">radix-2</a> (size <em>N</em>/2) and radix-4 (size <em>N</em>/4) Cooley-Tukey steps, respectively. (The underlying idea is that the even-index subtransform of radix-2 has no multiplicative factor in front of it, so it should be left as-is, while the odd-index subtransform of radix-2 benefits by combining a second recursive subdivision.)</p>
<p>These smaller summations are now exactly DFTs of length <em>N</em>/2 and <em>N</em>/4, which can be performed recursively and then recombined.</p>
<p>More specifically, let <span class="LaTeX">$U_k$</span> denote the result of the DFT of length <em>N</em>/2 (for <span class="LaTeX">$k = 0,\ldots,N/2-1$</span>), and let <span class="LaTeX">$Z_k$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$Z'_k$</span> denote the results of the DFTs of length <em>N</em>/4 (for <span class="LaTeX">$k = 0,\ldots,N/4-1$</span>). Then the output <span class="LaTeX">$X_k$</span> is simply:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$X_k = U_k + \omega_N^k Z_k + \omega_N^{3k} Z'_k.$$</span></p>
<p>This, however, performs unnecessary calculations, since <span class="LaTeX">$k \geq N/4$</span> turn out to share many calculations with <span class="LaTeX">$k < N/4$</span>. In particular, if we add <em>N</em>/4 to <em>k</em>, the size-<em>N</em>/4 DFTs are not changed (because they are periodic in <em>k</em>), while the size-<em>N</em>/2 DFT is unchanged if we add <em>N</em>/2 to <em>k</em>. So, the only things that change are the <span class="LaTeX">$\omega_N^k$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\omega_N^{3k}$</span> terms, known as <a href="twiddle_factor" title="wikilink">twiddle factors</a>. Here, we use the identities:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\omega_N^{k+N/4} = -i \omega_N^k$$</span></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\omega_N^{3(k+N/4)} = i \omega_N^{3k}$$</span> to finally arrive at:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$X_k = U_k + \left( \omega_N^k Z_k + \omega_N^{3k} Z'_k \right),$$</span></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$X_{k+N/2} = U_k - \left( \omega_N^k Z_k + \omega_N^{3k} Z'_k \right),$$</span></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$X_{k+N/4} = U_{k+N/4} - i \left( \omega_N^k Z_k - \omega_N^{3k} Z'_k \right),$$</span></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$X_{k+3N/4} = U_{k+N/4} + i \left( \omega_N^k Z_k - \omega_N^{3k} Z'_k \right),$$</span> which gives all of the outputs <span class="LaTeX">$X_k$</span> if we let <span class="LaTeX">$k$</span> range from <span class="LaTeX">$0$</span> to <span class="LaTeX">$N/4-1$</span> in the above four expressions.</p>
<p>Notice that these expressions are arranged so that we need to combine the various DFT outputs by pairs of additions and subtractions, which are known as <a href="butterfly_diagram" title="wikilink">butterflies</a>. In order to obtain the minimal operation count for this algorithm, one needs to take into account special cases for <span class="LaTeX">$k = 0$</span> (where the twiddle factors are unity) and for <span class="LaTeX">$k = N/8$</span> (where the twiddle factors are <span class="LaTeX">$(1 \pm i)/\sqrt{2}$</span> and can be multiplied more quickly); see, e.g. Sorensen <em>et al.</em> (1986). Multiplications by <span class="LaTeX">$\pm 1$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\pm i$</span> are ordinarily counted as free (all negations can be absorbed by converting additions into subtractions or vice versa).</p>
<p>This decomposition is performed recursively when <em>N</em> is a power of two. The base cases of the recursion are <em>N</em>=1, where the DFT is just a copy <span class="LaTeX">$X_0 = x_0$</span>, and <em>N</em>=2, where the DFT is an addition <span class="LaTeX">$X_0 = x_0 + x_1$</span> and a subtraction <span class="LaTeX">$X_1 = x_0 - x_1$</span>.</p>
<p>These considerations result in a count<span class="LaTeX">$$4 N \log_2 N - 6N + 8$$</span> real additions and multiplications, for <em>N</em>>1 a power of two. This count assumes that, for odd powers of 2, the leftover factor of 2 (after all the split-radix steps, which divide <em>N</em> by 4) is handled directly by the DFT definition (4 real additions and multiplications), or equivalently by a radix-2 Cooley–Tukey FFT step.</p>
