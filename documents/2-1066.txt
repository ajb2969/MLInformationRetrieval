   Square number      Square number   In mathematics , a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; 1 in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 9 is a square number, since it can be written as    3   ×   3      3  normal-  normal-×  normal-  3    3 × 3   .  The usual notation for the formula for the square of a number   n   n   n   is not the product    n  ×  n      n  normal-×  n    n×n   , but the equivalent exponentiation  , usually pronounced as "   n   n   n   squared". The name square number comes from the name of the shape; see below .  Square numbers are non-negative . Another way of saying that a (non-negative) number is a square number, is that its square roots are again integers. For example,    9      9    \sqrt{9}   = ±3, so 9 is a square number.  A positive integer that has no perfect square divisors except 1 is called square-free .  For a non-negative integer   n   n   n   , the   n   n   n   th square number is , with being the 0-th one. The concept of square can be extended to some other number systems. If rational numbers are included, then a square is the ratio of two square integers, and, conversely, the ratio of two square integers is a square (e.g., 4/9 = (2/3) 2 ).  Starting with 1, there are    ⌊   m   ⌋        m     \lfloor\sqrt{m}\rfloor   square numbers up to and including   m   m   m   , where the expression    ⌊  x  ⌋      x    \lfloor x\rfloor   represents the floor of the number   x   x   x   .  Examples  The squares  smaller than 60 2 are:    0 2 = 0  1 2 = 1  2 2 = 4  3 2 = 9  4 2 = 16  5 2 = 25  6 2 = 36  7 2 = 49  8 2 = 64  9 2 = 81      10 2 = 100  11 2 = 121  12 2 = 144  13 2 = 169  14 2 = 196  15 2 = 225  16 2 = 256  17 2 = 289  18 2 = 324  19 2 = 361      20 2 = 400  21 2 = 441  22 2 = 484  23 2 = 529  24 2 = 576  25 2 = 625  26 2 = 676  27 2 = 729  28 2 = 784  29 2 = 841      30 2 = 900  31 2 = 961  32 2 = 1024  33 2 = 1089  34 2 = 1156  35 2 = 1225  36 2 = 1296  37 2 = 1369  38 2 = 1444  39 2 = 1521      40 2 = 1600  41 2 = 1681  42 2 = 1764  43 2 = 1849  44 2 = 1936  45 2 = 2025  46 2 = 2116  47 2 = 2209  48 2 = 2304  49 2 = 2401      50 2 = 2500  51 2 = 2601  52 2 = 2704  53 2 = 2809  54 2 = 2916  55 2 = 3025  56 2 = 3136  57 2 = 3249  58 2 = 3364  59 2 = 3481    {{-}}  The difference between any perfect square and its predecessor is given by the identity      n  2   -    (   n  -  1   )   2    =    2  n   -  1          superscript  n  2    superscript    n  1   2        2  n   1     n^{2}-(n-1)^{2}=2n-1   . Equivalently, it is possible to count up square numbers by adding together the last square, the last square's root, and the current root, that is,     n  2   =     (   n  -  1   )   2   +   (   n  -  1   )   +  n        superscript  n  2      superscript    n  1   2     n  1   n     n^{2}=(n-1)^{2}+(n-1)+n   .  Properties  The number   m   m   m   is a square number if and only if one can compose a square of   m   m   m   equal (lesser) squares:       (Figure)  Square number 1.png       (Figure)  Square number 4.png       (Figure)  Square number 9.png       (Figure)  Square number 16.png       (Figure)  Square number 25.png      Note: White gaps between squares serve only to improve visual perception. There must be no gaps between actual squares.     The unit of area is defined as the area of unit square (    1   ×   1      1  normal-  normal-×  normal-  1    1 × 1   ). Hence, a square with side length   n   n   n   has area .  The expression for the   n   n   n   th square number is . This is also equal to the sum of the first   n   n   n    odd numbers as can be seen in the above pictures, where a square results from the previous one by adding an odd number of points (shown in magenta). The formula follows:        n  2   =    ∑   k  =  1   n    (    2  k   -  1   )     .       superscript  n  2     superscript   subscript     k  1    n       2  k   1      n^{2}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}(2k-1).   So for example, .  There are several recursive methods for computing square numbers. For example, the   n   n   n   th square number can be computed from the previous square by     n  2   =     (   n  -  1   )   2   +   (   n  -  1   )   +  n   =     (   n  -  1   )   2   +   (    2  n   -  1   )           superscript  n  2      superscript    n  1   2     n  1   n           superscript    n  1   2       2  n   1       n^{2}=(n-1)^{2}+(n-1)+n=(n-1)^{2}+(2n-1)   . Alternatively, the   n   n   n   th square number can be calculated from the previous two by doubling the    (   n  −   1   )      n  normal-−  normal-  1    (n− 1)   -th square, subtracting the    (   n  −   2   )      n  normal-−  normal-  2    (n− 2)   -th square number, and adding 2, because . For example,   .   A square number is also the sum of two consecutive triangular numbers . The sum of two consecutive square numbers is a centered square number . Every odd square is also a centered octagonal number .  Another property of a square number is that (except 0) it has an odd number of positive divisors, while other natural numbers have an even number of positive divisors. An integer root is the only divisor that pairs up with itself to yield the square number, while other divisors come in pairs.  Lagrange's four-square theorem states that any positive integer can be written as the sum of four or fewer perfect squares. Three squares are not sufficient for numbers of the form . A positive integer can be represented as a sum of two squares precisely if its prime factorization contains no odd powers of primes of the form     4  k   +  3        4  k   3    4k+3   . This is generalized by Waring's problem .  A square number can end only with digits  1,  4,  6,  9, 00, or 25 in base 10 , as follows:   If the last digit of a number is 0, its square ends in an even number of 0s (so at least 00) and the digits preceding the ending 0s must also form a square.  If the last digit of a number is 1 or 9, its square ends in 1 and the number formed by its preceding digits must be divisible by four.  If the last digit of a number is 2 or 8, its square ends in 4 and the preceding digit must be even.  If the last digit of a number is 3 or 7, its square ends in 9 and the number formed by its preceding digits must be divisible by four.  If the last digit of a number is 4 or 6, its square ends in 6 and the preceding digit must be odd .  If the last digit of a number is 5, its square ends in 25 and the preceding digits must form a pronic number .   In base 12 , a square number can end only with 0, 1, 4, or 9 and   in case 0, only 0 or 3 can precede it,  in case 1, only even numbers can precede it,  in case 4, only 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9 can precede it,  in case 9, only 0 or 6 can precede it.   In base 16 , a square number can end only with 0, 1, 4, or 9 and   in case 0, only 0, 1, 4, 9 can precede it,  in case 4, only even numbers can precede it.   In general, if a prime    p   p   p   divides a square number   m   m   m   then the square of   p   p   p   must also divide   m   m   m   ; if   p   p   p   fails to divide    m  ∕  p      m  normal-∕  p    m∕p   , then   m   m   m   is definitely not square. Repeating the divisions of the previous sentence, one concludes that every prime must divide a given perfect square an even number of times (including possibly 0 times). Thus, the number   m   m   m   is a square number if and only if, in its canonical representation , all exponents are even.  Squarity testing can be used as alternative way in factorization of large numbers. Instead of testing for divisibility, test for squarity: for given   m   m   m   and some number   k   k   k   , if is the square of an integer   n   n   n   then    k  −  n      k  normal-−  n    k−n   divides   m   m   m   . (This is an application of the factorization of a difference of two squares .) For example, is the square of 3, so consequently    100  −  3      100  normal-−  3    100−3   divides 9991. This test is deterministic for odd divisors in the range from    k  −  n      k  normal-−  n    k−n   to    k  +  n      k  n    k+n   where   k   k   k   covers some range of natural numbers    k  ≥      k  normal-≥    k≥       m      m    \sqrt{m}   .  A square number cannot be a perfect number .  The sum of the series of power numbers        ∑   n  =  0   N    n  2    =    0  2   +   1  2   +   2  2   +   3  2   +   4  2   +  ⋯  +   N  2          superscript   subscript     n  0    N    superscript  n  2       superscript  0  2    superscript  1  2    superscript  2  2    superscript  3  2    superscript  4  2   normal-⋯   superscript  N  2      \sum_{n=0}^{N}n^{2}=0^{2}+1^{2}+2^{2}+3^{2}+4^{2}+\cdots+N^{2}   can also be represented by the formula        N   (   N  +  1   )    (    2  N   +  1   )    6   .        N    N  1       2  N   1    6    \frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6}.   The first terms of this series (the square pyramidal numbers ) are:   0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, 91, 140, 204, 285, 385, 506, 650, 819, 1015, 1240, 1496, 1785, 2109, 2470, 2870, 3311, 3795, 4324, 4900, 5525, 6201... .   The sum of odd integers starting with one are perfect squares. 1, 1 + 3, 1 + 3 + 5, 1 + 3 + 5 +7,etc.  All fourth powers, sixth powers, eighth powers and so on are perfect squares.  Special cases   If the number is of the form m 5 where m represents the preceding digits, its square is n 25 where    n  =   m  ×   (   m  +  1   )        n    m  normal-×    m  1      n=m×(m+1)   and represents digits before 25. For example the square of 65 can be calculated by    n  =   6  ×   (   6  +  1   )    =  42        n    6  normal-×    6  1         42     n=6×(6+1)=42   which makes the square equal to 4225.  If the number is of the form m 0 where m represents the preceding digits, its square is n 00 where . For example the square of 70 is 4900.  If the number has two digits and is of the form 5 m where m represents the units digit, its square is AABB where     A  A   =   25  +  m         A  A     25  m     AA=25+m   and . Example: To calculate the square of 57, 25 + 7 = 32 and 7 2 = 49, which means 57 2 = 3249.  If the number ends in 5, its square will end in 5; similarly for ending in 25, 625, 0625, 90625, ... 8212890625, etc. If the number ends in 6, its square will end in 6, similarly for ending in 76, 376, 9376, 09376, ... 1787109376. For example, the square of 55376 is 3066501376, both ending in 376 . (The numbers 5, 6, 25, 76, etc. are called automorphic numbers . They are sequence A003226 in the OEIS .)   Odd and even square numbers  Squares of even numbers are even (and in fact divisible by 4), since .  Squares of odd numbers are odd, since .  It follows that square roots of even square numbers are even, and square roots of odd square numbers are odd.  As all even square numbers are divisible by 4, the even numbers of the form     4  n   +  2        4  n   2    4n+2   are not square numbers.  As all odd square numbers are of the form     4  n   +  1        4  n   1    4n+1   , the odd numbers of the form     4  n   +  3        4  n   3    4n+3   are not square numbers.  Squares of odd numbers are of the form     8  n   +  1        8  n   1    8n+1   , since and    n   (   n  +  1   )       n    n  1     n(n+1)   is an even number.  Every odd perfect square is a centered octagonal number . The difference between any two odd perfect squares is a multiple of 8. The difference between 1 and any higher odd perfect square always is eight times a triangular number, while the difference between 9 and any higher odd perfect square is eight times a triangular number minus eight. Since all triangular numbers have an odd factor, but no two values of differ by an amount containing an odd factor, the only perfect square of the form is 1, and the only perfect square of the form is 9.
