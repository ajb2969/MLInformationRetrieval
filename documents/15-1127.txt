   Ent-isokaurene C2-hydroxylase      Ent-isokaurene C2-hydroxylase   Ent-isokaurene C2-hydroxylase (, CYP71Z6 ) is an enzyme with system name ent-isokaurene,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (hydroxylating) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   ent-isokaurene + O 2 + NADPH + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ent-2alpha-hydroxyisokaurene + H 2 O + NADP +    Ent-isokaurene C2-hydroxylase performs the initial step in the conversion of ent-isokaurene to the antibacterial oryzalides in rice, Oryza sativa .
