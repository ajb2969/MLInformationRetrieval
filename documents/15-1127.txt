Ent-isokaurene C2-hydroxylase

Ent-isokaurene C2-hydroxylase (, CYP71Z6) is an enzyme with system name ent-isokaurene,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (hydroxylating).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ent-isokaurene + O2 + NADPH + H+

 
  ent-2alpha-hydroxyisokaurene + H2O + NADP+


Ent-isokaurene C2-hydroxylase performs the initial step in the conversion of ent-isokaurene to the antibacterial oryzalides in rice, Oryza sativa.
