Characteristic state function

The characteristic state function in statistical mechanics refers to a particular relationship between the partition function of an ensemble.
In particular, if the partition function P satisfies


 
  or 
 
 

in which Q is a thermodynamic quantity, then Q is known as the "characteristic state function" of the ensemble corresponding to "P". Beta refers to the thermodynamic beta.
Examples

The microcanonical ensemble satisfies 
 
 
 
  hence, its characteristic state function is 
 
 
 
 .
The canonical ensemble satisfies 
 
 
 
  hence, its characteristic state function is the Helmholtz free energy

 
 .
The grand canonical ensemble satisfies 
 
 
 
 , so its characteristic state function is the Grand potential

 
 .
The isothermal-isobaric ensemble satisfies 
 
 
 
  so its characteristic function is the Gibbs free energy

 
 .

State functions are those which tell about the equilibrium state of a system"
