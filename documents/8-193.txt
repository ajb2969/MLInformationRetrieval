   Characteristic state function      Characteristic state function   The characteristic state function in statistical mechanics refers to a particular relationship between the partition function of an ensemble .  In particular, if the partition function P satisfies      P  =   exp   (   -   Œ≤  Q    )        P        Œ≤  Q       P=\exp(-\beta Q)   or    P  =   exp   (   +   Œ≤  Q    )        P        Œ≤  Q       P=\exp(+\beta Q)     in which Q is a thermodynamic quantity, then Q is known as the "characteristic state function" of the ensemble corresponding to "P". Beta refers to the thermodynamic beta .  Examples   The microcanonical ensemble satisfies     Œ©   (  U  ,  V  ,  N  )    =    e   Œ≤  T  S           normal-Œ©   U  V  N     superscript  e    Œ≤  T  S      \Omega(U,V,N)=e^{\beta TS}\;\,   hence, its characteristic state function is    T  S      T  S    TS   .  The canonical ensemble satisfies     Z   (  T  ,  V  ,  N  )    =    e   -   Œ≤  A            Z   T  V  N     superscript  e      Œ≤  A       Z(T,V,N)=e^{-\beta A}\,\;   hence, its characteristic state function is the Helmholtz free energy    A   A   A   .  The grand canonical ensemble satisfies     ùíµ   (  T  ,  V  ,  Œº  )    =    e   -   Œ≤  Œ¶            ùíµ   T  V  Œº     superscript  e      Œ≤  normal-Œ¶       \mathcal{Z}(T,V,\mu)=e^{-\beta\Phi}\,\;   , so its characteristic state function is the Grand potential    Œ¶   normal-Œ¶   \Phi   .  The isothermal-isobaric ensemble satisfies     Œî   (  N  ,  T  ,  P  )    =    e   -   Œ≤  G            normal-Œî   N  T  P     superscript  e      Œ≤  G       \Delta(N,T,P)=e^{-\beta G}\;\,   so its characteristic function is the Gibbs free energy    G   G   G   .   State functions are those which tell about the equilibrium state of a system"  Category:Statistical mechanics
