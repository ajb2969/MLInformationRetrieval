   Completely multiplicative function      Completely multiplicative function   In number theory , functions of positive integers which respect products are important and are called completely multiplicative functions or totally multiplicative functions . A weaker condition is also important, respecting only products of coprime numbers, and such functions are called multiplicative functions . Outside of number theory, the term "multiplicative function" is often taken to be synonymous with "completely multiplicative function" as defined in this article.  Definition  A completely multiplicative function (or totally multiplicative function ) is an arithmetic function (that is, a function whose domain is the natural numbers ), such that f (1) = 1 and f ( ab ) = f ( a ) f ( b ) holds for all positive integers a and b . 1  Without the requirement that f (1) = 1, one could still have f (1) = 0, but then f ( a ) = 0 for all positive integers a , so this is not a very strong restriction.  The definition above can be rephrased using the language of algebra: A completely multiplicative function is an endomorphism of the monoid    (   ℤ  +   ,  ⋅  )      superscript  ℤ    normal-⋅    (\mathbb{Z}^{+},\cdot)   , that is, the positive integers under multiplication.  Examples  The easiest example of a completely multiplicative function is a monomial with leading coefficient 1: For any particular positive integer n , define f ( a ) = a n . Then f ( bc ) = ( bc ) n = b n c n = f ( b ) f ( c ), and f (1) = 1 n = 1.  The Liouville function is a non-trivial example of a completely multiplicative function as are Dirichlet characters .  Properties  A completely multiplicative function is completely determined by its values at the prime numbers, a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic . Thus, if n is a product of powers of distinct primes, say n = p a  q b ..., then f ( n ) = f ( p ) a  f ( q ) b ...  While the Dirichlet convolution of two multiplicative functions is multiplicative, the Dirichlet convolution of two completely multiplicative functions need not be completely multiplicative.  There are a variety of statements about a function which are equivalent to it being completely multiplicative. For example, if a function f multiplicative then is completely multiplicative if and only if the Dirichlet inverse is    μ  f      μ  f    \mu f   where   μ   μ   \mu   is the Möbius function . 2  Completely multiplicative functions also satisfy a pseudo-associative law. If f is completely multiplicative then       f  ⋅   (   g  *  h   )    =    (   f  ⋅  g   )   *   (   f  ⋅  h   )         normal-⋅  f    g  h       normal-⋅  f  g    normal-⋅  f  h      f\cdot(g*h)=(f\cdot g)*(f\cdot h)     where * represents the Dirichlet product and   ⋅   normal-⋅   \cdot   represents pointwise multiplication. 3 One consequence of this is that for any completely multiplicative function f one has       f  *  f   =   τ  ⋅  f         f  f    normal-⋅  τ  f     f*f=\tau\cdot f     which deduced from the latter/above for [both]    g  =  h  =  1        g  h       1     g=h=1   , where     1   (  n  )    =  1        1  n   1    1(n)=1   is well-known constant function . Here   τ   τ   \tau   is the divisor function .  Proof of pseudo-associative property       f  ⋅   (   g  *  h   )     (  n  )        normal-⋅  f    g  h    n    \displaystyle f\cdot\left(g*h\right)(n)     Dirichlet series  Moreover, The L-function of completely (or totally) multiplicative  Dirichlet series a(n) satisfies        L   (  s  ,  a  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     a   (  n  )     n  s     =    ∏  p     (   1  -    a   (  p  )     p  s     )    -  1      ,          L   s  a      subscript   superscript       n  1        a  n    superscript  n  s            subscript  product  p    superscript    1      a  p    superscript  p  s       1        L(s,a)=\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{a(n)}{n^{s}}=\prod_{p}\biggl(1-\frac{a(p)}{p^{%
 s}}\biggr)^{-1},   which means that the sum all over the natural numbers is equal to the product all over the prime numbers.
