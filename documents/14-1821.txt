Weak duality

In applied mathematics, weak duality is a concept in optimization which states that the duality gap is always greater than or equal to 0. That means the solution to the primal (minimization) problem is always greater than or equal to the solution to an associated dual problem. This is opposed to strong duality which only holds in certain cases.1
Uses
Many primal-dual approximation algorithms are based on the principle of weak duality.2
Weak duality theorem
If 
 
 
 
  is a feasible solution for the primal minimization linear program and 
 
 
 
  is a feasible solution for the dual maximization linear program, then the weak duality theorem can be stated as 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the coefficients of the respective objective functions.
Generalizations
More generally, if 
 
 
 
  is a feasible solution for the primal minimization problem and 
 
 
 
  is a feasible solution for the dual maximization problem, then weak duality implies 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the objective functions for the primal and dual problems respectively.
