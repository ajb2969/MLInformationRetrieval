Fpqc morphism

In algebraic geometry, an fpqc morphism

 
  of schemes is a faithfully flat morphism that satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

Every quasi-compact open subset of Y is the image of a quasi-compact open subset of X.
There exists a covering 
 
 
 
  of Y by open affine subschemes such that each 
 
 
 
  is the image of a quasi-compact open subset of X.
Each point 
 
 
 
 
  has a neighborhood 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is open and 
 
 
 
  is quasi-compact.
Each point 
 
 
 
  has a quasi-compact neighborhood such that 
 
 
 
 
  is open affine.

Examples: An open faithfully flat morphism is fpqc.
An fpqc morphism satisfies the following properties:

The composite of fpqc morphisms is fpqc.
A base change of an fpqc morphism is fpqc.
If 
 
 
 
  is a morphism of schemes and if there is an open covering 
 
 
 
  of Y such that the 
 
 
 
  is fpqc, then f is fpqc.
A faithfully flat morphism that is locally of finite presentation (i.e., fppf) is fpqc.
If 
 
 
 
  is an fpqc morphism, a subset of Y is open in Y if and only if its inverse image under f is open in X.

Fpqc stands for the French phrase "fid√®lement plat et quasi-compact", meaning "faithfully flat and quasi-compact".
