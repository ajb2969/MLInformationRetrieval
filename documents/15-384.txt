   Fpqc morphism      Fpqc morphism   In algebraic geometry , an fpqc morphism     f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   of schemes is a faithfully flat morphism that satisfies the following equivalent conditions:   Every quasi-compact open subset of Y is the image of a quasi-compact open subset of X .  There exists a covering    V  i     subscript  V  i    V_{i}   of Y by open affine subschemes such that each    V  i     subscript  V  i    V_{i}   is the image of a quasi-compact open subset of X.  Each point    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   has a neighborhood   U   U   U   such that    f   (  U  )       f  U    f(U)   is open and    f  :   U  →   f   (  U  )        normal-:  f   normal-→  U    f  U      f:U\to f(U)   is quasi-compact .  Each point    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   has a quasi-compact neighborhood such that    f   (  U  )       f  U    f(U)   is open affine.   Examples: An open faithfully flat morphism is fpqc.  An fpqc morphism satisfies the following properties:   The composite of fpqc morphisms is fpqc.  A base change of an fpqc morphism is fpqc.  If    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   is a morphism of schemes and if there is an open covering    V  i     subscript  V  i    V_{i}   of Y such that the    f  :     f   -  1     (   V  i   )    →   V  i       normal-:  f   normal-→     superscript  f    1     subscript  V  i     subscript  V  i      f:f^{-1}(V_{i})\to V_{i}   is fpqc, then f is fpqc.  A faithfully flat morphism that is locally of finite presentation (i.e., fppf) is fpqc.  If    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   is an fpqc morphism, a subset of Y is open in Y if and only if its inverse image under f is open in X.   Fpqc stands for the French phrase "fidèlement plat et quasi-compact", meaning "faithfully flat and quasi-compact".
