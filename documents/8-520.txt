   Kenneth Kunen      Kenneth Kunen    Herbert Kenneth Kunen (born August 2, 1943) is an emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison 1 who works in set theory and its applications to various areas of mathematics, such as set-theoretic topology and measure theory . He also works on non-associative algebraic systems, such as loops , and uses computer software, such as the Otter theorem prover , to derive theorems in these areas.  Kunen showed that if there exists a nontrivial elementary embedding j : L → L of the constructible universe , then 0 # exists. He proved the consistency of a normal,    ℵ  2     subscript  normal-ℵ  2    \aleph_{2}   -saturated ideal on    ℵ  1     subscript  normal-ℵ  1    \aleph_{1}   from the consistency of the existence of a huge cardinal . He introduced the method of iterated ultrapowers , with which he proved that if   κ   κ   \kappa   is a measurable cardinal with     2  κ   >   κ  +        superscript  2  κ    superscript  κ      2^{\kappa}>\kappa^{+}   or   κ   κ   \kappa   is a strongly compact cardinal then there is an inner model of set theory with   κ   κ   \kappa   many measurable cardinals. He proved Kunen's inconsistency theorem showing the impossibility of a nontrivial elementary embedding    V  →  V     normal-→  V  V    V\to V   , which had been suggested as a large cardinal assumption (a Reinhardt cardinal ).  Away from the area of large cardinals, Kunen is known for intricate forcing and combinatorial constructions. He proved that it is consistent that the Martin Axiom first fails at a singular cardinal and constructed under CH a compact L-space supporting a nonseparable measure. He also showed that      P   (  ω  )    /  F   i  n          P  ω   F   i  n    P(\omega)/Fin   has no increasing chain of length    ω  2     subscript  ω  2    \omega_{2}   in the standard Cohen model where the continuum is    ℵ  2     subscript  normal-ℵ  2    \aleph_{2}   . The concept of a Jech–Kunen tree is named after him and Thomas Jech .  Kunen received his Ph.D. in 1968 from Stanford University , 2 where he was supervised by Dana Scott .
