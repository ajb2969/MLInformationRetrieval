Palmitoyl(protein) hydrolase




Palmitoyl(protein) hydrolase

In enzymology, a palmitoyl[protein] hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

palmitoyl[protein] + H2O 
 
 
 
  palmitate + protein
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are palmitoyl[protein] and H2O, whereas its two products are palmitate and protein.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is palmitoyl[protein] hydrolase. Other names in common use include palmitoyl-protein thioesterase, and palmitoyl-(protein) hydrolase. This enzyme participates in fatty acid elongation in mitochondria.
