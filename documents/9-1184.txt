   Zuckerman functor      Zuckerman functor   In mathematics , a Zuckerman functor is used to construct representations of real reductive  Lie groups from representations of Levi subgroups . They were introduced by Gregg Zuckerman (1978). The Bernstein functor is closely related.  Notation and terminology   G is a connected reductive real affine algebraic group (for simplicity; the theory works for more general groups), and g is the Lie algebra of G . K is a maximal compact subgroup of G .  L is a Levi subgroup of G , the centralizer of a compact connected abelian subgroup, and * l is the Lie algebra of L .  A representation of K is called K-finite if every vector is contained in a finite-dimensional representation of K . Denote by W K the subspace of K -finite vectors of a representation W of K .  A (g,K)-module is a vector space with compatible actions of g and K , on which the action of K is K -finite.  R( g , K ) is the Hecke algebra of G of all distributions on G with support in K that are left and right K finite. This is a ring which does not have an identity but has an approximate identity , and the approximately unital R( g , K )- modules are the same as ( g , K ) modules.   Definition  The Zuckerman functor Γ is defined by       Γ   g  ,   L  ∩  K     g  ,  K     (  W  )   =   hom   R   (  g  ,   L  ∩  K   )       (  R   (  g  ,  K  )   ,  W  )   K      fragments   subscript   superscript  normal-Γ   g  K     g    L  K      fragments  normal-(  W  normal-)     subscript  hom    R   g    L  K       subscript   fragments  normal-(  R   fragments  normal-(  g  normal-,  K  normal-)   normal-,  W  normal-)   K     \Gamma^{g,K}_{g,L\cap K}(W)=\hom_{R(g,L\cap K)}(R(g,K),W)_{K}     and the Bernstein functor Π is defined by         Π   g  ,   L  ∩  K     g  ,  K     (  W  )    =    R   (  g  ,  K  )     ⊗   R   (  g  ,   L  ∩  K   )     W    .         subscript   superscript  normal-Π   g  K     g    L  K     W     subscript  tensor-product    R   g    L  K        R   g  K    W     \Pi^{g,K}_{g,L\cap K}(W)=R(g,K)\otimes_{R(g,L\cap K)}W.
