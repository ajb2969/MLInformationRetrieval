Cis-p-coumarate glucosyltransferase




Cis-p-coumarate glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, a cis-p-coumarate glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + cis-p-coumarate 
 
 
 
  4'-O-beta-D-glucosyl-cis-p-coumarate + UDP
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and cis-p-coumarate, whereas its two products are 4'-O-beta-D-glucosyl-cis-p-coumarate and UDP.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:cis-p-coumarate beta-D-glucosyltransferase.
