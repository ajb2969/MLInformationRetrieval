   Bs space      Bs space   In the mathematical field of functional analysis , the space bs consists of all infinite sequences ( x i ) of real or complex numbers such that       sup  n    |    ∑   i  =  1   n    x  i    |       subscript  supremum  n       superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  x  i       \sup_{n}\left|\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\right|     is finite. The set of such sequences forms a normed space with the vector space operations defined componentwise , and the norm given by         ∥  x  ∥    b  s    =    sup  n    |    ∑   i  =  1   n    x  i    |     .       subscript   norm  x     b  s      subscript  supremum  n       superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  x  i        \left\|x\right\|_{bs}=\sup_{n}\left|\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\right|.     Furthermore, with respect to metric induced by this norm, bs is complete : it is a Banach space .  The space of all sequences ( x i ) such that the series       ∑   i  =  1   ∞    x  i       superscript   subscript     i  1       subscript  x  i     \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}x_{i}     is convergent (possibly conditionally ) is denoted by cs . This is a closed  vector subspace of bs , and so is also a Banach space with the same norm.  The space bs is isometrically  isomorphic to the space of bounded sequences ℓ ∞ via the mapping        T   (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  )    =   (   x  1   ,    x  1   +   x  2    ,    x  1   +   x  2   +   x  3    ,  …  )    .        T    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…      subscript  x  1      subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3    normal-…     T(x_{1},x_{2},\dots)=(x_{1},x_{1}+x_{2},x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3},\dots).     Furthermore, the space of convergent sequences  c is the image of cs under T .  References    .   "  Category:Banach spaces  Category:Functional analysis
