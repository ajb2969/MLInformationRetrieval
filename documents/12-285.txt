   Ponderal index      Ponderal index   The Ponderal Index ( PI ) is a measure of leanness of a person 1 calculated as a relationship between mass and height. 2 It was first proposed in 1921 as the "Corpulence Index" by Rohrer and hence also known as Rohrer's index. 3 It is similar to the body mass index , but the mass is normalized with the third power of body height rather than the second power.      PI  =    m  a  s  s    h  e  i  g  h   t  3         PI      m  a  s  s     h  e  i  g  h   superscript  t  3       \mathrm{PI}=\frac{mass}{height^{3}}   For a baby, it is calculated as      PI  =    b  i  r  t  h  w  e  i  g  h  t     C  r  o  w  n   -   h  e  e  l   -   l  e  n  g  t   h  3          PI      b  i  r  t  h  w  e  i  g  h  t       C  r  o  w  n     h  e  e  l     l  e  n  g  t   superscript  h  3        \mathrm{PI}=\frac{birthweight}{Crown-heel-length^{3}}    4 with    m  a  s  s      m  a  s  s    mass   in kg (kilograms) and    h  e  i  g  h  t      h  e  i  g  h  t    height   in m (meters), giving a measure with the same dimensions as density . The ponderal index yields valid results even for very short and very tall persons. 5 Because of this property, it is most commonly used in pediatrics . 6 7 The normal values for infants are about twice as high as for adults, which is the result of their relatively short legs.  The ponderal index is variously defined (the first definition should be preferred due to the use of SI-units  kg and m ) as follows:      Formula   Units for mass (body weight)   Units for height (or length)   Values corresponding to "normal"  BMI in a 180 cm tall person           PI  =    m  a  s  s    h  e  i  g  h   t  3         PI      m  a  s  s     h  e  i  g  h   superscript  t  3       \text{PI}=\frac{mass}{height^{3}}    8   kilograms   metres   10.3 to 13.9, 24 for 12-month-old infant 9         PI  =   100    m  a  s  s    h  e  i  g  h   t  3          PI    100      m  a  s  s     h  e  i  g  h   superscript  t  3        \text{PI}=100\frac{mass}{height^{3}}    10   grams   centimetres   2.4 for 12-month-old infant         PI  =   1000  ×     m  a  s  s   3    h  e  i  g  h  t         PI    1000       3     m  a  s  s      h  e  i  g  h  t       \text{PI}=1000\times\frac{\sqrt[3]{mass}}{height}    11   kilograms   centimetres   21.75 to 24.0 12         PI  =   100  ×     m  a  s  s   3    h  e  i  g  h  t         PI    100       3     m  a  s  s      h  e  i  g  h  t       \text{PI}=100\times\frac{\sqrt[3]{mass}}{height}    13   kilograms   centimetres   2.175 to 2.4         PI  =    h  e  i  g  h  t     m  a  s  s   3        PI      h  e  i  g  h  t      3     m  a  s  s       \text{PI}=\frac{height}{\sqrt[3]{mass}}    14   pounds   inches   12.49 to 13.92     Significance   It plays a role in assessing whether a the intrauterine growth restriction of a child is symmetrical or asymmetrical. 15  Body adiposity index   See also   Body mass index  Waist-to-height ratio   References    External links   Online Ponderal Index Calculator , which uses the first definition.
