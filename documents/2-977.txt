   Translation (geometry)      Translation (geometry)     In Euclidean geometry , a translation is a function that moves every point a constant distance in a specified direction. (Also in Euclidean geometry a transformation is a one to one correspondence between two sets of points or a mapping from one plane to another. 1 A translation can be described as a rigid motion : other rigid motions include rotations and reflections. A translation can also be interpreted as the addition of a constant vector to every point, or as shifting the origin of the coordinate system . A translation operator is an operator     T  δ     subscript  T  δ    T_{\mathbf{\delta}}   such that       T  δ   f   (  𝐯  )    =   f   (   𝐯  +  δ   )     .         subscript  T  δ   f  𝐯     f    𝐯  δ      T_{\mathbf{\delta}}f(\mathbf{v})=f(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{\delta}).     If v is a fixed vector, then the translation T v will work as T v ( p ) = p + v .  If T is a translation, then the image of a subset A under the function  T is the translate of A by T . The translate of A by T v is often written A + v .  In a Euclidean space , any translation is an isometry . The set of all translations forms the translation group T , which is isomorphic to the space itself, and a normal subgroup of Euclidean group  E ( n ). The quotient group of E ( n ) by T is isomorphic to the orthogonal group  O ( n ):   E ( n ) / T ≅ O ( n ).   Matrix representation  A translation is an affine transformation with no  fixed points . Matrix multiplications always have the origin as a fixed point. Nevertheless, there is a common workaround using homogeneous coordinates to represent a translation of a vector space with matrix multiplication : Write the 3-dimensional vector w = ( w x , w y , w z ) using 4 homogeneous coordinates as w = ( w x , w y , w z , 1). 2  To translate an object by a vector  v , each homogeneous vector p (written in homogeneous coordinates) can be multiplied by this translation matrix :       T  𝐯   =   [     1    0    0     v  x       0    1    0     v  y       0    0    1     v  z       0    0    0    1     ]        subscript  T  𝐯     1  0  0   subscript  v  x     0  1  0   subscript  v  y     0  0  1   subscript  v  z     0  0  0  1      T_{\mathbf{v}}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&v_{x}\\
 0&1&0&v_{y}\\
 0&0&1&v_{z}\\
 0&0&0&1\end{bmatrix}   As shown below, the multiplication will give the expected result:        T  𝐯   𝐩   =    [     1    0    0     v  x       0    1    0     v  y       0    0    1     v  z       0    0    0    1     ]    [      p  x        p  y        p  z       1     ]    =   [       p  x   +   v  x          p  y   +   v  y          p  z   +   v  z        1     ]   =   𝐩  +  𝐯            subscript  T  𝐯   𝐩       1  0  0   subscript  v  x     0  1  0   subscript  v  y     0  0  1   subscript  v  z     0  0  0  1       subscript  p  x      subscript  p  y      subscript  p  z     1               subscript  p  x    subscript  v  x         subscript  p  y    subscript  v  y         subscript  p  z    subscript  v  z      1           𝐩  𝐯      T_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{p}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&v_{x}\\
 0&1&0&v_{y}\\
 0&0&1&v_{z}\\
 0&0&0&1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}p_{x}\\
 p_{y}\\
 p_{z}\\
 1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}p_{x}+v_{x}\\
 p_{y}+v_{y}\\
 p_{z}+v_{z}\\
 1\end{bmatrix}=\mathbf{p}+\mathbf{v}     The inverse of a translation matrix can be obtained by reversing the direction of the vector:        T  𝐯   -  1    =   T   -  𝐯     .       subscript   superscript  T    1    𝐯    subscript  T    𝐯      T^{-1}_{\mathbf{v}}=T_{-\mathbf{v}}.\!     Similarly, the product of translation matrices is given by adding the vectors:         T  𝐮    T  𝐯    =   T   𝐮  +  𝐯     .         subscript  T  𝐮    subscript  T  𝐯     subscript  T    𝐮  𝐯      T_{\mathbf{u}}T_{\mathbf{v}}=T_{\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}}.\!   Because addition of vectors is commutative , multiplication of translation matrices is therefore also commutative (unlike multiplication of arbitrary matrices).  Translations in physics  In physics , translation (Translational motion) is movement that changes the position of an object, as opposed to rotation . For example, according to Whittaker: 3   A translation is the operation changing the positions of all points (x, y, z) of an object according to the formula       (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )   →   (   x  +   Δ  x    ,   y  +   Δ  y    ,   z  +   Δ  z    )      normal-→   x  y  z      x    normal-Δ  x      y    normal-Δ  y      z    normal-Δ  z       (x,y,z)\to(x+\Delta x,y+\Delta y,z+\Delta z)     where    (   Δ  x   ,   Δ  y   ,   Δ  z   )       normal-Δ  x     normal-Δ  y     normal-Δ  z     (\Delta x,\ \Delta y,\ \Delta z)   is the same vector for each point of the object. The translation vector    (   Δ  x   ,   Δ  y   ,   Δ  z   )       normal-Δ  x     normal-Δ  y     normal-Δ  z     (\Delta x,\ \Delta y,\ \Delta z)   common to all points of the object describes a particular type of displacement of the object, usually called a linear displacement to distinguish it from displacements involving rotation, called angular displacements.  When considering spacetime , a change of time coordinate is considered to be a translation. For example, the Galilean group and the Poincaré group include translations with respect to time.
