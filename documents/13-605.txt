   Jacobi coordinates      Jacobi coordinates   In the theory of many-particle systems, Jacobi coordinates often are used to simplify the mathematical formulation. These coordinates are particularly common in treating polyatomic molecules and chemical reactions, 1 and in celestial mechanics.  For example, see   An algorithm for generating the Jacobi coordinates for N bodies may be based upon binary trees . 2 In words, the algorithm is described as follows: 3   Let m j and m k be the masses of two bodies that are replaced by a new body of virtual mass M = m j + m k . The position coordinates x j and x k are replaced by their relative position r jk = x j − x k and by the vector to their center of mass R jk = ( m j  q j + m k q k )/( m j + m k ). The node in the binary tree corresponding to the virtual body has m j as its right child and m k as its left child. The order of children indicates the relative coordinate points from x k to x j . Repeat the above step for N − 1 bodies, that is, the N − 2 original bodies plus the new virtual body.   For the four-body problem the result is: 4        𝒓  𝟏   =    𝒙  𝟏   -    𝒙  𝟐      ,       subscript  𝒓  1      subscript  𝒙  1    subscript  𝒙  2      \boldsymbol{r_{1}=x_{1}-x_{2}}\ ,           𝒓  𝒋   =     1   m   0  j       ∑   k  =  1   j     m  k     𝒙  𝒌       -    𝒙   𝒋  +  𝟏       ,       subscript  𝒓  𝒋         1   subscript  m    0  j       superscript   subscript     k  1    j      subscript  m  k    subscript  𝒙  𝒌       subscript  𝒙    𝒋  1       \boldsymbol{r_{j}}=\frac{1}{m_{0j}}\sum_{k=1}^{j}m_{k}\boldsymbol{x_{k}}\ -\ %

The vector R is the center of mass of all the bodies:       𝑹  =    1   m  0       ∑   k  =  1   N      m  k     𝒙  𝒌        ;      𝑹      1   subscript  m  0      superscript   subscript     k  1    N      subscript  m  k    subscript  𝒙  𝒌        \boldsymbol{R}=\frac{1}{m_{0}}\sum_{k=1}^{N}\ m_{k}\boldsymbol{x_{k}}\ ;         m  0   =     ∑   k  =  1   N      m  k      .       subscript  m  0     superscript   subscript     k  1    N    subscript  m  k      m_{0}=\sum_{k=1}^{N}\ m_{k}\ .     The result one is left with is thus a system of N translationally-invariant coordinates and a reduced mass, from iteratively treats and reducing two-body systems within the many-body system.
