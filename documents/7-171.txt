   Causal filter      Causal filter   In signal processing , a causal filter is a linear and time-invariant  causal system . The word causal indicates that the filter output depends only on past and present inputs. A filter whose output also depends on future inputs is non-causal , whereas a filter whose output depends only on future inputs is anti-causal . Systems (including filters) that are realizable (i.e. that operate in real time ) must be causal because such systems cannot act on a future input. In effect that means the output sample that best represents the input at time    t  ,    t   t,   comes out slightly later. A common design practice for digital filters is to create a realizable filter by shortening and/or time-shifting a non-causal impulse response. If shortening is necessary, it is often accomplished as the product of the impulse-response with a window function .  An example of an anti-causal filter is a maximum phase filter, which can be defined as a stable , anti-causal filter whose inverse is also stable and anti-causal.  (Figure)  Each component of the causal filter output begins when its stimulus begins. The outputs of the non-causal filter begin before the stimulus begins.   Example  The following definition is a moving (or "sliding") average of input data    s   (  x  )       s  x    s(x)\,   . A constant factor of 1/2 is omitted for simplicity:       f   (  x  )    =    ∫   x  -  1    x  +  1     s   (  τ  )   d   τ     =    ∫   -  1    +  1     s   (   x  +  τ   )   d   τ             f  x     superscript   subscript     x  1      x  1      s  τ  d  τ           superscript   subscript     1      1      s    x  τ   d  τ       f(x)=\int_{x-1}^{x+1}s(\tau)\,d\tau\ =\int_{-1}^{+1}s(x+\tau)\,d\tau\,     where x could represent a spatial coordinate, as in image processing. But if    x    x   x\,   represents time    (  t  )    t   (t)\,   , then a moving average defined that way is non-causal (also called non-realizable ), because    f   (  t  )       f  t    f(t)\,   depends on future inputs, such as    s   (   t  +  1   )       s    t  1     s(t+1)\,   . A realizable output is       f   (   t  -  1   )    =    ∫   -  2   0    s   (   t  +  τ   )   d  τ    =    ∫  0   +  2     s   (   t  -  τ   )   d   τ             f    t  1      superscript   subscript     2    0     s    t  τ   d  τ           superscript   subscript   0     2      s    t  τ   d  τ       f(t-1)=\int_{-2}^{0}s(t+\tau)\,d\tau=\int_{0}^{+2}s(t-\tau)\,d\tau\,     which is a delayed version of the non-realizable output.  Any linear filter (such as a moving average) can be characterized by a function h ( t ) called its impulse response . Its output is the convolution        f   (  t  )    =    (   h  *  s   )    (  t  )    =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞    h   (  τ  )   s   (   t  -  τ   )   d  τ     .          f  t       h  s   t          superscript   subscript            h  τ  s    t  τ   d  τ       f(t)=(h*s)(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}h(\tau)s(t-\tau)\,d\tau.\,     In those terms, causality requires       f   (  t  )    =    ∫  0  ∞    h   (  τ  )   s   (   t  -  τ   )   d  τ          f  t     superscript   subscript   0       h  τ  s    t  τ   d  τ      f(t)=\int_{0}^{\infty}h(\tau)s(t-\tau)\,d\tau     and general equality of these two expressions requires h ( t ) = 0 for all t g(t) = {h(t) + h^{*}(-t) \over 2}  which is non-causal. On the other hand, g ( t ) is Hermitian and, consequently, its Fourier transform G (ω) is real-valued. We now have the following relation       h   (  t  )    =      2   Θ   (  t  )    ⋅  g    (  t  )          h  t      normal-⋅    2  normal-Θ  t   g   t     h(t)=2\,\Theta(t)\cdot g(t)\,     where Θ( t ) is the Heaviside unit step function .  This means that the Fourier transforms of h ( t ) and g ( t ) are related as follows       H   (  ω  )    =     (    δ   (  ω  )    -   i   π  ω     )   *  G    (  ω  )    =    G   (  ω  )    -    i  ⋅   G  ^     (  ω  )             H  ω           δ  ω     i    π  ω     G   ω            G  ω      normal-⋅  i   normal-^  G    ω       H(\omega)=\left(\delta(\omega)-{i\over\pi\omega}\right)*G(\omega)=G(\omega)-i%
 \cdot\widehat{G}(\omega)\,     where     G  ^    (  ω  )        normal-^  G   ω    \widehat{G}(\omega)\,   is a Hilbert transform done in the frequency domain (rather than the time domain). The sign of     G  ^    (  ω  )        normal-^  G   ω    \widehat{G}(\omega)\,   may depend on the definition of the Fourier Transform.  Taking the Hilbert transform of the above equation yields this relation between "H" and its Hilbert transform:        H  ^    (  ω  )    =   i  H   (  ω  )           normal-^  H   ω     i  H  ω     \widehat{H}(\omega)=iH(\omega)     References     "  Category:Signal processing  Category:Filter theory
