   Half-integer      Half-integer   In mathematics , a half-integer is a number of the form      n  +   1  2       n    1  2     n+{1\over 2}   , where   n   n   n   is an integer . For example,   4½, 7/2, −13/2, 8.5   are all half-integers.  Half-integers occur frequently enough in mathematical contexts that a special term for them is convenient. Note that a half of an integer is not always a half-integer: half of an even integer is an integer but not a half-integer. The half-integers are precisely those numbers that are half of an odd integer , and for this reason are also called the half-odd-integers . Half-integers are a special case of the dyadic rationals , numbers that can be formed by dividing an integer by a power of two . 1  Notation and algebraic structure  The set of all half-integers is often denoted       ℤ  +   1  2    .      ℤ    1  2     \mathbb{Z}+{1\over 2}.   The integers and half-integers together form a group under the addition operation, which may be denoted 2       1  2   ℤ        1  2   ℤ    \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}   . However, these numbers do not form a ring because the product of two half-integers is generally not itself a half-integer. 3  Uses  Sphere packing  The densest lattice packing of unit spheres in four dimensions, called the D 4 lattice , places a sphere at every point whose coordinates are either all integers or all half-integers. This packing is closely related to the Hurwitz integers , which are quaternions whose real coefficients are either all integers or all half-integers. 4  Physics  In physics, the Pauli exclusion principle results from definition of fermions as particles which have spins that are half-integers. 5  The energy levels of the quantum harmonic oscillator occur at half-integers and thus its lowest energy is not zero. 6  Sphere volume  Although the factorial function is defined only for integer arguments, it can be extended to fractional arguments using the gamma function . The gamma function for half-integers is an important part of the formula for the volume of an n -dimensional ball of radius R , 7         V  n    (  R  )    =     π   n  /  2     Γ   (    n  2   +  1   )      R  n     .         subscript  V  n   R        superscript  π    n  2      normal-Γ      n  2   1      superscript  R  n      V_{n}(R)=\frac{\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2}+1)}R^{n}.   The values of the gamma function on half-integers are integer multiples of the square root of pi : 8       Γ   (    1  2   +  n   )    =        (    2  n   -  1   )   !   !    2  n      π    =      (   2  n   )   !     4  n    n  !      π            normal-Γ      1  2   n                2  n   1      superscript  2  n      π                 2  n       superscript  4  n     n       π       \Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}+n\right)=\frac{(2n-1)!!}{2^{n}}\,\sqrt{\pi}={(2n)!%
