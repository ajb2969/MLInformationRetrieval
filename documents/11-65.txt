   Cobalt chelatase      Cobalt chelatase   Cobalt chelatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide + Co 2+ + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + cob(II)yrinic acid a,c-diamide + H +    The 4 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide , Co 2+ , and H 2 O , whereas its 4 products are ADP , phosphate , cob(II)yrinic acid a,c-diamide , and H + .  The aerobic cobalt chelatase (aerobic cobalamin biosynthesis pathway) 1 2 consists of three subunits, CobT, CobN () and CobS ().  Cobalamin (vitamin B12) can be complexed with metal via the ATP-dependent reactions (aerobic pathway) (e.g., in Pseudomonas denitrificans ) or via ATP-independent reactions (anaerobic pathway) (e.g., in Salmonella typhimurium ). 3 4 The corresponding cobalt chelatases are not homologous. However, aerobic cobalt chelatase subunits CobN and CobS are homologous to Mg-chelatase subunits BchH and BchI, respectively. 5 CobT, too, has been found to be remotely related to the third subunit of Mg-chelatase, BchD (involved in bacteriochlorophyll synthesis, e.g., in Rhodobacter capsulatus). 6  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming nitrogen-D-metal bonds in coordination complexes. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hydrogenobyrinic-acid-a,c-diamide:cobalt cobalt-ligase (ADP-forming) . Other names in common use include hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide cobaltochelatase , CobNST , and CobNCobST . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism .
