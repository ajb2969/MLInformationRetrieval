   2-enoate reductase      2-enoate reductase   In enzymology , a 2-enoate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   butanoate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-butenoate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are butanoate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 2-butenoate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is butanoate:NAD+ Delta2-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called enoate reductase . This enzyme participates in phenylalanine metabolism . It has 4 cofactors : FAD , Iron , Sulfur , and Iron-sulfur .
