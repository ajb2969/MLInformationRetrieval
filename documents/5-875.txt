   Similarity invariance      Similarity invariance   In linear algebra , similarity invariance is a property exhibited by a function whose value is unchanged under similarities of its domain. That is,   f   f   f   is invariant under similarities if     f   (  A  )    =   f   (    B   -  1    A  B   )          f  A     f     superscript  B    1    A  B      f(A)=f(B^{-1}AB)   where     B   -  1    A  B       superscript  B    1    A  B    B^{-1}AB   is a matrix similar to A . Examples of such functions include the trace , determinant , and the minimal polynomial .  A more colloquial phrase that means the same thing as similarity invariance is "basis independence", since a matrix can be regarded as a linear operator, written in a certain basis, and the same operator in a new base is related to one in the old base by the conjugation     B   -  1    A  B       superscript  B    1    A  B    B^{-1}AB   , where   B   B   B   is the transformation matrix to the new base.
