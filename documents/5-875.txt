Similarity invariance

In linear algebra, similarity invariance is a property exhibited by a function whose value is unchanged under similarities of its domain. That is, 
 
 
 
  is invariant under similarities if 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a matrix similar to A. Examples of such functions include the trace, determinant, and the minimal polynomial.
A more colloquial phrase that means the same thing as similarity invariance is "basis independence", since a matrix can be regarded as a linear operator, written in a certain basis, and the same operator in a new base is related to one in the old base by the conjugation 
 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the transformation matrix to the new base.
