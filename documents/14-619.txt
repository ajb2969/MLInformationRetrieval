Dieudonné determinant

In linear algebra, the Dieudonné determinant is a generalization of the determinant of a matrix to matrices over division rings and local rings. It was introduced by .
If K is a division ring, then the Dieudonné determinant is a homomorphism of groups from the group GLn(K) of invertible n by n matrices over K onto the abelianization K*/[K*, K*] of the multiplicative group K* of K.
For example, the Dieudonné determinant for a 2-by-2 matrix is



Properties
Let R be a local ring. There is a determinant map from the matrix ring GL(R) to the abelianised unit group R∗ab with the following properties:1

The determinant is invariant under elementary row operations
The determinant of the identity is 1
If a row is left multiplied by a in R∗ then the determinant is left multiplied by a
The determinant is multiplicative: det(AB) = det(A)det(B)
If two rows are exchanged, the determinant is multiplied by −1
The determinant is invariant under transposition

Tannaka–Artin problem
Assume that K is finite over its centre F. The reduced norm gives a homomorphism Nn from GLn(K) to F*. We also have a homomorphism from GLn(K) to F* obtained by composing the Dieudonné determinant from GLn(K) to K*/[K*, K*] with the reduced norm N1 from GL1(K) = K* to F* via the abelianization.
The Tannaka–Artin problem is whether these two maps have the same kernel SLn(K). This is true when F is locally compact2 but false in general.3
