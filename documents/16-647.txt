Rubidium hydrogen sulfate

Rubidium hydrogen sulfate is the rubidium salt of sulfuric acid. It has the formula RbHSO4.
Synthesis
It may be synthesised with water and a stoichiometric amount of rubidium disulfate. Reaction takes place where there is no humidity: 1


There is an other method of creation. It is similar to the synthesis of sodium sulfate and potassium sulfate. For this reaction there need for rubidium chloride and a little bit warm sulfuric acid. Some hydrogen chloride is also produced during the reaction.



Properties
It is a hydroscopic compound. It has a monocline crystal structure, its structure is P21/n. Parameters of the bonding modes: a = 1440 pm, b = 462,2 pm, c = 1436 pm and β = 118,0°. Its crystals are isomorphs with ammonium hydrogen sulfate crystals. 2
Its standard enthalpy is −1166 kJ/mol 3 During its dissolution in water there is 15.62 kJ/mol energy produced. 4
After warming up it resolves to rubidium disulfate and water:5



Like potassium and caesium, rubidium has an other hydrogene sulfate compound as well: Rb3H(SO4)2.
