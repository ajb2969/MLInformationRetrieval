Generalized tree alignment

In computational phylogenetics, generalized tree alignment is the problem of producing a multiple sequence alignment and a phylogenetic tree on a set of sequences simultaneously, as opposed to separately.1
Formally, Generalized tree alignment is the following optimization problem.
Input: A set 
 
 
 
  and an edit distance function 
 
 
 
  between sequences,
Output: A tree 
 
 
 
  leaf-labeled by 
 
 
 
  and labeled with sequences at the internal nodes, such that 
 
 
 
  is minimized, where 
 
 
 
  is the edit distance between the endpoints of 
 
 
 
 .2
Note that this is in contrast to tree alignment, where the tree is provided as input.
