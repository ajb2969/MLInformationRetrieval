   Generalized tree alignment      Generalized tree alignment   In computational phylogenetics , generalized tree alignment is the problem of producing a multiple sequence alignment and a phylogenetic tree on a set of sequences simultaneously, as opposed to separately. 1  Formally, Generalized tree alignment is the following optimization problem.  Input : A set   S   S   S   and an edit distance function   d   d   d   between sequences,  Output : A tree   T   T   T   leaf-labeled by   S   S   S   and labeled with sequences at the internal nodes, such that     Σ   e  ∈  T    d   (  e  )        subscript  normal-Σ    e  T    d  e    \Sigma_{e\in T}d(e)   is minimized, where    d   (  e  )       d  e    d(e)   is the edit distance between the endpoints of   e   e   e   . 2  Note that this is in contrast to tree alignment , where the tree is provided as input.
