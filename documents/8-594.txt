Riesz mean

In mathematics, the Riesz mean is a certain mean of the terms in a series. They were introduced by Marcel Riesz in 1911 as an improvement over the Cesàro mean. The Riesz mean should not be confused with the Bochner–Riesz mean or the Strong–Riesz mean.
Definition
Given a series 
 
 
 
 , the Riesz mean of the series is defined by



Sometimes, a generalized Riesz mean is defined as



Here, the 
 
 
 
  are sequence with 
 
 
 
  and with 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 . Other than this, the 
 
 
 
 
  are otherwise taken as arbitrary.
Riesz means are often used to explore the summability of sequences; typical summability theorems discuss the case of 
 
 
 
  for some sequence 
 
 
 
 . Typically, a sequence is summable when the limit 
 
 
 
  exists, or the limit 
 
 
 
  exists, although the precise summability theorems in question often impose additional conditions.
Special cases
Let 
 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . Then



Here, one must take 
 
 
 
 ; 
 
 
 
  is the Gamma function and 
 
 
 
  is the Riemann zeta function. The power series



can be shown to be convergent for 
 
 
 
 . Note that the integral is of the form of an inverse Mellin transform.
Another interesting case connected with number theory arises by taking 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Von Mangoldt function. Then



Again, one must take c > 1. The sum over ρ is the sum over the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function, and



is convergent for λ > 1.
The integrals that occur here are similar to the Nörlund–Rice integral; very roughly, they can be connected to that integral via Perron's formula.
