Kneser graph

In graph theory, the Kneser graph  is the graph whose vertices correspond to the 

 
 -element subsets of a set of 
 
 
 
  elements, and where two vertices are adjacent if and only if the two corresponding sets are disjoint. Kneser graphs are named after Martin Kneser, who first investigated them in 1955.
Examples
The complete graph on 
 
 
 
  vertices is the Kneser graph .
The complement of the line graph of the complete graph on 
 
 
 
  vertices is the Kneser graph .
The Kneser graph  is known as the odd graph ; the odd graph  is isomorphic to the Petersen graph.
Properties

The Kneser graph is vertex transitive and edge transitive. Each vertex has exactly 
 
 
 
  neighbors. However, the Kneser graph is not, in general, a strongly regular graph, as different pairs of nonadjacent vertices have different numbers of common neighbors depending on the size of the intersection of the corresponding pair of sets.
As  conjectured, the chromatic number of the Kneser graph  is exactly 
 
 
 
 ; for instance, the Petersen graph requires three colors in any proper coloring.  proved this using topological methods, giving rise to the field of topological combinatorics. Soon thereafter  gave a simple proof, using the Borsuk–Ulam theorem and a lemma of David Gale, and  won the Morgan Prize for a further simplified but still topological proof.  found a purely combinatorial proof.
When 
 
 
 
 , the Kneser graph  always contains a Hamiltonian cycle . Computational searches have found that all connected Kneser graphs for 
 
 
 
 , except for the Petersen graph, are Hamiltonian .

The graph spectrum of the Kneser graph  is given as follows:

The Erdős-Ko-Rado theorem states that the independence number of the Kneser graph  is
 
 



Related graphs
The Johnson graph  is the graph whose vertices are the 
 
 
 
 -element subsets of an 
 
 
 
 -element set, two vertices being adjacent when they meet in a 
 
 
 
 -element set. For 
 
 
 
  the Johnson graph is the complement of the Kneser graph . Johnson graphs are closely related to the Johnson scheme, both of which are named after Selmer M. Johnson.
The generalized Kneser graph  has the same vertex set as the Kneser graph , but connects two vertices whenever they correspond to sets that intersect in 
 
 
 
  or fewer items . Thus .
The bipartite Kneser graph  has as vertices the sets of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  items drawn from a collection of 
 
 
 
  elements. Two vertices are connected by an edge whenever one set is a subset of the other. Like the Kneser graph it is vertex transitive with degree $\textstyle\binom{n-k}{k}$. The bipartite Kneser graph can be formed as a bipartite double cover of  in which one makes two copies of each vertex and replaces each edge by a pair of edges connecting corresponding pairs of vertices . The bipartite Kneser graph  is the Desargues graph and the bipartite Kneser graph  is a crown graph.
