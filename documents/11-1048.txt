   Z-farnesyl diphosphate synthase      Z-farnesyl diphosphate synthase   In enzymology , a Z-farnesyl diphosphate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   geranyl diphosphate + isopentenyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + (2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are geranyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate , whereas its two products are diphosphate and (2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is geranyl-diphosphate:isopentenyl-diphosphate geranylcistransferase . This enzyme is also called (Z)-farnesyl diphosphate synthase .
