The Lie algebra of all derivations on A commuting with the left regular representation of G on A is denoted by    Lie   (  G  )      Lie  G    \operatorname{Lie}(G)   and is called the Lie algebra of G . It is isomorphic to the tangent space to G at the identity via   α   α   \alpha   given by     α   (  D  )   f   =    (   D  f   )    (  e  )          α  D  f       D  f   e     \alpha(D)f=(Df)(e)   .  Fundamental groups  Let X be a connected scheme.  If X is a smooth variety over the complex numbers, then     π  1  ét   X       superscript   subscript  π  1   ét   X    \pi_{1}^{\text{ét}}X   is the profinite completion of the fundamental group of the complex manifold    X   (  ℂ  )       X  ℂ    X(\mathbb{C})   . (That they are not equal is due to the fact there is no algebraic variety that is a universal covering space .)  If    X  =   Spec  F       X   Spec  F     X=\operatorname{Spec}F   for some field F , then      π  1  ét   X   =   Gal   (    F  ¯   /  F   )           superscript   subscript  π  1   ét   X    Gal     normal-¯  F   F      \pi_{1}^{\text{ét}}X=\operatorname{Gal}(\overline{F}/F)   .  Intersection theory  Let     c  1    (  L  )        subscript  c  1   L    c_{1}(L)   be an endomorphism defined by:        c  1    (  L  )   F   =   F  -    L   -  1    ⊗  F           subscript  c  1   L  F     F   tensor-product   superscript  L    1    F      c_{1}(L)F=F-L^{-1}\otimes F   .  The intersection number of L and M is defined by:  Picard stack  "
