== Differential module == 
Let 
 
 
 
  be a linear algebraic group. The Lie algebra of all derivations on A commuting with the left regular representation of G on A is denoted by 
 
 
 
  and is called the Lie algebra of G. It is isomorphic to the tangent space to G at the identity via 
 
 
 
  given by 
 
 
 
 
 .
Fundamental groups
Let X be a connected scheme.
If X is a smooth variety over the complex numbers, then 
 
 
 
  is the profinite completion of the fundamental group of the complex manifold 
 
 
 
 . (That they are not equal is due to the fact there is no algebraic variety that is a universal covering space.)
If 
 
 
 
  for some field F, then 
 
 
 
 .
Intersection theory
Let 
 
 
 
 
  be an endomorphism defined by:


 
 .
The intersection number of L and M is defined by:
