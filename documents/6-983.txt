Unconditional convergence

Unconditional convergence is a topological property (convergence) related to an algebraical object (sum). It is an extension of the notion of convergence for series of countably many elements to series of arbitrarily many. It has been mostly studied in Banach spaces.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a topological vector space. Let 
 
 
 
  be an index set and 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 
 .
The series 
 
 
 
  is called unconditionally convergent to 
 
 
 
 , if

the indexing set 
 
 
 
  is countable and
for every permutation of 
 
 
 
  the relation holds
 
 


Alternative definition
Unconditional convergence is often defined in an equivalent way: A series is unconditionally convergent if for every sequence 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 , the series



converges.
Every absolutely convergent series is unconditionally convergent, but the converse implication does not hold in general. When X = Rn, then, by the Riemann series theorem, the series 
 
 
 
  is unconditionally convergent if and only if it is absolutely convergent.
