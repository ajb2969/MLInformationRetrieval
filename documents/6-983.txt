   Unconditional convergence      Unconditional convergence   Unconditional convergence is a topological property (convergence) related to an algebraical object (sum). It is an extension of the notion of convergence for series of countably many elements to series of arbitrarily many. It has been mostly studied in Banach spaces .  Definition  Let   X   X   X   be a topological vector space . Let   I   I   I   be an index set and     x  i   ∈  X       subscript  x  i   X    x_{i}\in X   for all    i  ∈  I      i  I    i\in I   .  The series     ∑   i  ∈  I     x  i       subscript     i  I     subscript  x  i     \textstyle\sum_{i\in I}x_{i}   is called unconditionally convergent to    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   , if   the indexing set     I  0   :=   {   i  ∈  I   :    x  i   ≠  0   }      assign   subscript  I  0    conditional-set    i  I      subscript  x  i   0      I_{0}:=\{i\in I:x_{i}\neq 0\}   is countable and  for every permutation of     I  0   :=   {   i  ∈  I   :    x  i   ≠  0   }      assign   subscript  I  0    conditional-set    i  I      subscript  x  i   0      I_{0}:=\{i\in I:x_{i}\neq 0\}   the relation holds      ∑   i  =  1   ∞    x  i    =  x        superscript   subscript     i  1       subscript  x  i    x    \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}x_{i}=x      Alternative definition  Unconditional convergence is often defined in an equivalent way: A series is unconditionally convergent if for every sequence     (   ε  n   )    n  =  1   ∞     superscript   subscript   subscript  ε  n     n  1       (\varepsilon_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}   , with     ε  n   ∈   {   -  1   ,   +  1   }        subscript  ε  n      1     1      \varepsilon_{n}\in\{-1,+1\}   , the series       ∑   n  =  1   ∞     ε  n    x  n        superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  ε  n    subscript  x  n      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\varepsilon_{n}x_{n}     converges.  Every absolutely convergent series is unconditionally convergent, but the converse implication does not hold in general. When X = R n , then, by the Riemann series theorem , the series    ∑   x  n        subscript  x  n     \sum x_{n}   is unconditionally convergent if and only if it is absolutely convergent.
