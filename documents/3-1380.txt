   Skew-Hermitian matrix      Skew-Hermitian matrix   In linear algebra , a square matrix with complex entries is said to be skew-Hermitian or antihermitian if its conjugate transpose is equal to its negative. 1 That is, the matrix A is skew-Hermitian if it satisfies the relation        A  †   =   -  A    ,       superscript  A  normal-†     A     A^{\dagger}=-A,\;     where   †   normal-†   \dagger   denotes the conjugate transpose of a matrix. In component form, this means that        a   i  ,  j    =   -    a   j  ,  i    ¯     ,       subscript  a   i  j       normal-¯   subscript  a   j  i        a_{i,j}=-\overline{a_{j,i}},   for all i and j , where a i , j is the i , j -th entry of A , and the overline denotes complex conjugation .  Skew-Hermitian matrices can be understood as the complex versions of real skew-symmetric matrices , or as the matrix analogue of the purely imaginary numbers. 2 All skew-Hermitian n × n matrices form the u ( n ) Lie algebra , which corresponds to the Lie group U( n ) . The concept can be generalized to include linear transformations of any complex  vector space with a sesquilinear  norm .  Example  For example, the following matrix is skew-Hermitian:      [      -  i      2  +  i        -   (   2  -  i   )      0     ]        i     2  i         2  i    0     \begin{bmatrix}-i&2+i\\
 -(2-i)&0\end{bmatrix}     Properties   The eigenvalues of a skew-Hermitian matrix are all purely imaginary or zero. Furthermore, skew-Hermitian matrices are normal . Hence they are diagonalizable and their eigenvectors for distinct eigenvalues must be orthogonal. 3  All entries on the main diagonal of a skew-Hermitian matrix have to be pure imaginary , i.e., on the imaginary axis (the number zero is also considered purely imaginary). 4  If A, B are skew-Hermitian, then aA + bB is skew-Hermitian for all real  scalars  a and b . 5  If A is skew-Hermitian, then both i A and − i A are Hermitian . 6  If A is skew-Hermitian, then A k is Hermitian if k is an even integer and skew-Hermitian if k is an odd integer.  An arbitrary (square) matrix C can uniquely be written as the sum of a Hermitian matrix A and a skew-Hermitian matrix B : 7           C  =    A  +  B   with      A  =     1  2    (   C  +   C  †    )    and     B  =    1  2    (   C  -   C  †    )       .     formulae-sequence    C     A  B   with     formulae-sequence    A       1  2     C   superscript  C  normal-†     and      B      1  2     C   superscript  C  normal-†         C=A+B\quad\mbox{with}\quad A=\frac{1}{2}(C+C^{\dagger})\quad\mbox{and}\quad B=%
 \frac{1}{2}(C-C^{\dagger}).         If A is skew-Hermitian, then e A is unitary .  The space of skew-Hermitian matrices forms the Lie algebra u( n ) of the Lie group U( n ).
