Trigonometric moment problem

In mathematics, the trigonometric moment problem is formulated as follows: given a finite sequence {α0, ... αn }, does there exist a positive Borel measure μ on the interval [0, 2π] such that



In other words, an affirmative answer to the problems means that {α0, ... αn } are the first n + 1 Fourier coefficients of some positive Borel measure μ on [0, 2π].
Characterization
The trigonometric moment problem is solvable, that is, {αk} is a sequence of Fourier coefficients, if and only if the (n + 1) × (n + 1) Toeplitz matrix



is positive semidefinite.
The "only if" part of the claims can be verified by a direct calculation.
We sketch an argument for the converse. The positive semidefinite matrix A defines a sesquilinear product on Cn + 1, resulting in a Hilbert space



of dimensional at most n + 1, a typical element of which is an equivalence class denoted by [f]. The Toeplitz structure of A means that a "truncated" shift is a partial isometry on 
 
 
 
 . More specifically, let { e0, ...en } be the standard basis of Cn + 1. Let 
 
 
 
  be the subspace generated by { [e0], ... [en - 1] } and 
 
 
 
 
  be the subspace generated by { [e1], ... [en] }. Define an operator



by



Since



V can be extended to a partial isometry acting on all of 
 
 
 
 . Take a minimal unitary extension U of V, on a possibly larger space (this always exists). According to the spectral theorem, there exists a Borel measure m on the unit circle T such that for all integer k



For k = 0,...,n, the left hand side is



So



Finally, parametrize the unit circle T by eit on [0, 2π] gives



for some suitable measure ''μ.
Parametrization of solutions
The above discussion shows that the trigonometric moment problem has infinitely many solutions if the Toeplitz matrix A is invertible. In that case, the solutions to the problem are in bijective correspondence with minimal unitary extensions of the partial isometry V.
