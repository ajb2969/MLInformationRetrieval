   Cuntz algebra      Cuntz algebra   In mathematics, the Cuntz algebra     𝒪  n     subscript  𝒪  n    \mathcal{O}_{n}   (after Joachim Cuntz ) is the universal C*-algebra generated by n isometries satisfying certain relations. It is the first concrete example of a separable infinite simple C*-algebra.  Every simple infinite C*-algebra contains, for any given n , a subalgebra that has    𝒪  n     subscript  𝒪  n    \mathcal{O}_{n}   as quotient.  Definition and basic properties  Let n ≥ 2 and H be a separable  Hilbert space . Consider the C*-algebra    𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   generated by a set         {   S  i   }    i  =  1   n     superscript   subscript    subscript  S  i      i  1    n    \{S_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}        of isometries acting on H satisfying           ∑   i  =  1   n     S  i    S  i  *     =  I   .        superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  S  i    superscript   subscript  S  i       I    \sum_{i=1}^{n}S_{i}S_{i}^{*}=I.        and           S  i  *    S  j    =    δ   i  j    I    .         superscript   subscript  S  i      subscript  S  j       subscript  δ    i  j    I     S_{i}^{*}S_{j}=\delta_{ij}I.        Theorem. The concrete C*-algebra   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   is isomorphic to the universal C*-algebra   ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   generated by n generators s 1 ... s n subject to relations s i *s i = 1 for all i and ∑ s i s i * = 1.  The proof of the theorem hinges on the following fact: any C*-algebra generated by n isometries s 1 ... s n with orthogonal ranges contains a copy of the UHF algebra    ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   type n ∞ . Namely   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   is spanned by words of the form         s   i  1    ⋯   s   i  k     s   j  1   *   ⋯   s   j  k   *    ,  k   ≥  0.          subscript  s   subscript  i  1    normal-⋯   subscript  s   subscript  i  k     superscript   subscript  s   subscript  j  1      normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  s   subscript  j  k       k   0.    s_{i_{1}}\cdots s_{i_{k}}s_{j_{1}}^{*}\cdots s_{j_{k}}^{*},k\geq 0.     The *-subalgebra   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   , being approximately finite-dimensional , has a unique C*-norm. The subalgebra   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   plays role of the space of Fourier coefficients for elements of the algebra. A key technical lemma, due to Cuntz, is that an element in the algebra is zero if and only if all its Fourier coefficients vanish. Using this, one can show that the quotient map from   ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   to   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   is injective, which proves the theorem.  This universal C*-algebra is called the Cuntz algebra , denoted by    𝒪  n     subscript  𝒪  n    \mathcal{O}_{n}   .  A C*-algebra is said to be purely infinite if every hereditary C*-subalgebra of it is infinite.    𝒪  n     subscript  𝒪  n    \mathcal{O}_{n}   is a separable, simple , purely infinite C*-algebra.  Any simple infinite C*-algebra contains a subalgebra that has    𝒪  n     subscript  𝒪  n    \mathcal{O}_{n}   as a quotient.  The UHF algebra   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   has a non-unital subalgebra    ℱ  ′     superscript  ℱ  normal-′    \mathcal{F}^{\prime}   that is canonically isomorphic to   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   itself: In the M n stage of the direct system defining   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   , consider the rank-1 projection e 11 , the matrix that is 1 in the upper left corner and zero elsewhere. Propagate this projection through the direct system. At the M n k stage of the direct system, one has a rank n k - 1 projection. In the direct limit , this gives a projection P in   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   . The corner       P  ℱ  P   =   ℱ  ′         P  ℱ  P    superscript  ℱ  normal-′     P\mathcal{F}P=\mathcal{F^{\prime}}     is isomorphic to   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   . The *-endomorphism Φ that maps   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   onto    ℱ  ′     superscript  ℱ  normal-′    \mathcal{F}^{\prime}   is implemented by the isometry s 1 , i.e. Φ(·) = s 1 (·) s 1 *.     𝒪   n     subscript  𝒪  n    \;\mathcal{O}_{n}   is in fact the crossed product of   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   with the endomorphism Φ.  Classification  The Cuntz algebras are pairwise non-isomorphic, i.e.    𝒪  n     subscript  𝒪  n    \mathcal{O}_{n}   and    𝒪  m     subscript  𝒪  m    \mathcal{O}_{m}   are non-isomorphic for n ≠ m . The K 0 group of    𝒪  n     subscript  𝒪  n    \mathcal{O}_{n}   is Z n − 1 , the abelian cyclic group of order n − 1. Since K 0 is a (functorial) invariant,    𝒪  n     subscript  𝒪  n    \mathcal{O}_{n}   and    𝒪  m     subscript  𝒪  m    \mathcal{O}_{m}   are non-isomorphic.  Generalisations  Cuntz algebras have been generalised in many ways. Notable amongst which are the Cuntz–Krieger algebras , graph C*-algebras and k-graph C*-algebras .  Applied mathematics  In signal processing , subband filter with exact reconstruction give rise to representations of Cuntz algebra. The same filters also comes from the multiresolution analysis construction in wavelet theory.  References      "  Category:C*-algebras
