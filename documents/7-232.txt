Ostrowski's theorem

In number theory, Ostrowski's theorem, due to Alexander Ostrowski (1916), states that every non-trivial absolute value on the rational numbers Q is equivalent to either the usual real absolute value or a 

 
 -adic absolute value.1
Definitions
Two absolute values

 
  and 
 
 
 
  on a field K are defined to be equivalent if there exists a real number

 
  such that



The trivial absolute value on any field K is defined to be



The real absolute value on the rationals Q is the standard absolute value on the reals, defined to be


 
  This is sometimes written with a subscript 1 instead of infinity.
For a prime number

 
 , the 
 
 
 
 -adic absolute value on Q is defined as follows: any non-zero rational 
 
 
 
 , can be written uniquely as 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
pairwise coprime and 
 
 
 
  some integer; so we define



Proof
Consider a non-trivial absolute value on the rationals 
 
 
 
 . We consider two cases,

(i) 
 
 

(ii) 
 
 


It suffices for us to consider the valuation of integers greater than one. For, if we find 
 
 
 
  in  for which 
 
 
 
  for all naturals greater than one; then this relation trivially holds for 0 and 1, and for positive rationals



and for negative rationals



Case I: ∃n ∈ N   |n|∗ > 1
Consider the following calculation. Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be natural numbers with 
 
 
 
 . Expressing  in base

 
  yields



Then we see, by the properties of an absolute value:



Therefore



However we have:



which implies:



Now choose 
 
 




i.e.



By symmetry, this inequality is an equality.
Since 
 
 
 
  were arbitrary, there is a constant, 
 
 
 
  for which 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
  for all naturals 
 
 
 
 . As per the above remarks, we easily see that for all rationals, 
 
 
 
 , thus demonstrating equivalence to the real absolute value.
Case II: ∀n ∈ N   |n|∗ ≤ 1
As this valuation is non-trivial, there must be a natural number for which n{{!}}∗ . Factorising this natural,


 
  be such that 
 
 
 
 . By the Euclidean algorithm, there are 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . This yields



a contradiction.
So we must have pj{{!}}∗ {{=}} α  for some 
 
 
 
 , and pi{{!}}∗ {{=}} 1}} for 
 
 
 
 . Letting



we see that for general positive naturals


 
  all rationals, implying the absolute value is equivalent to the 
 
 
 
 -adic one.
One can also show a stronger conclusion, namely that 
 
 
 
  is a nontrivial absolute value if and only if either 
 
 
 
  for some $c\in (0,1]$ or $|\cdot|_\ast=|\cdot|_p^c$ for some $c\in(0,\infty),p\in\mathbf{P}$.
Another Ostrowski's theorem
Another theorem states that any field, complete with respect to an archimedean absolute value, is (algebraically and topologically) isomorphic to either the real numbers or the complex numbers. This is sometimes also referred to as Ostrowski's theorem.2
