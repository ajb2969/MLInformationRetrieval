   4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate oxidase      4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate oxidase   In enzymology , a 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate + 1/2 O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-hydroxyphenylacetate + CO 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and O 2 , whereas its two products are 4-hydroxyphenylacetate and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate:oxygen oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) . This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism .
