3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA + NAD+

 
  3-oxoacyl-CoA + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are 3-oxoacyl-CoA, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, to be specific those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor.
Isozymes
In humans, the following genes encode proteins with 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity:

HADH – Hydroxyacyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase
HSD17B10 – 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type-2
EHHADH – Peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme
HSD17B4 – Peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme type 2

Function
3-Hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase is classified as an oxidoreductase.It is involved in fatty acid metabolic processes. Specifically it catalyzes the third step of beta oxidation; the oxidation of L-3-hydroxyacyl CoA by NAD+. The reaction converts the hydroxyl group into a keto group. 
The end product is 3-ketoacyl CoA.
Metabolic pathways
This enzyme participates in 8 metabolic pathways: 

fatty acid elongation in mitochondria
fatty acid metabolism
valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation
lysine degradation
tryptophan metabolism
benzoate degradation via coa ligation
butanoate metabolism
caprolactam degradation
