Hammer retroazimuthal projection

 
The Hammer retroazimuthal projection is a modified azimuthal proposed by Ernst Hermann Heinrich Hammer in 1910. As a retroazimuthal projection, azimuths (directions) are correct from any point to the designated center point.1 In whole-world presentation, the back and front hemispheres overlap, making the projection a non-injective function. Given a radius R for the projecting globe, the projection is defined as:






where



and



The latitude and longitude of the point to be plotted are φ and λ respectively, and the center point to which all azimuths are to be correct is given as φ1 and λ0.
