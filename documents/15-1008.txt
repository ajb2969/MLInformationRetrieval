   Hammer retroazimuthal projection      Hammer retroazimuthal projection     The Hammer retroazimuthal projection is a modified azimuthal proposed by Ernst Hermann Heinrich Hammer in 1910. As a retroazimuthal projection , azimuths (directions) are correct from any point to the designated center point. 1 In whole-world presentation, the back and front hemispheres overlap, making the projection a non- injective function. Given a radius R for the projecting globe, the projection is defined as:      x  =   R  K   cos   ϕ  1     sin   (   λ  -   λ  0    )         x    R  K     subscript  ϕ  1        λ   subscript  λ  0        x=RK\cos\phi_{1}\sin(\lambda-\lambda_{0})         y  =   -   R  K   [     sin   ϕ  1     cos  ϕ    -    cos   ϕ  1     sin  ϕ    cos   (   λ  -   λ  0    )      ]         y      R  K   delimited-[]         subscript  ϕ  1      ϕ         subscript  ϕ  1      ϕ       λ   subscript  λ  0            y=-RK[\sin\phi_{1}\cos\phi-\cos\phi_{1}\sin\phi\cos(\lambda-\lambda_{0})]     where      K  =   z  /   sin  z        K    z    z      K=z/\sin z     and       cos  z   =     sin   ϕ  1     sin  ϕ    +    cos   ϕ  1     cos  ϕ    cos   (   λ  -   λ  0    )            z          subscript  ϕ  1      ϕ         subscript  ϕ  1      ϕ       λ   subscript  λ  0         \cos z=\sin\phi_{1}\sin\phi+\cos\phi_{1}\cos\phi\cos(\lambda-\lambda_{0})     The latitude and longitude of the point to be plotted are φ and λ respectively, and the center point to which all azimuths are to be correct is given as φ 1 and λ 0 .
