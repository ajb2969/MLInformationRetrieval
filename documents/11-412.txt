   3'-nucleotidase      3'-nucleotidase   In enzymology , a 3'-nucleotidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a 3'-ribonucleotide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a ribonucleoside + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-ribonucleotide and H 2 O , whereas its two products are ribonucleoside and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-ribonucleotide phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include 3'-mononucleotidase , 3'-phosphatase , and 3'-ribonucleotidase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism .
