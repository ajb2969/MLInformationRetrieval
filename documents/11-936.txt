Imidazole N-acetyltransferase




Imidazole N-acetyltransferase

In enzymology, an imidazole N-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acetyl-CoA + imidazole 
 
 
 
  CoA + N-acetylimidazole
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and imidazole, whereas its two products are CoA and N-acetylimidazole.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:imidazole N-acetyltransferase. Other names in common use include imidazole acetylase, and imidazole acetyltransferase.
