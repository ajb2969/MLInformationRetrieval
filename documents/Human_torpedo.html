<h1>Human torpedo</h1>
<hr/>

<p> <strong>Human torpedoes</strong> or <strong>manned torpedoes</strong> are a type of rideable <a class="uri" href="submarine" title="wikilink">submarine</a> used as secret naval weapons in <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. The basic design is still in use today; they are a type of <a href="diver_propulsion_vehicle" title="wikilink">diver propulsion vehicle</a>.</p>

<p>The name was commonly used to refer to the weapons that Italy, and later Britain, deployed in the <a href="Mediterranean_Sea" title="wikilink">Mediterranean</a> and used to attack ships in enemy harbours. A group of a dozen countries used the human torpedo, from Italy and the United Kingdom to Argentina and Egypt, and there are some museums and movies dedicated to this naval weapon. The human torpedo concept is used recreationally for sport diving.</p>
<h2 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h2>

<p>The first human torpedo (the Italian <em>Maiale</em>) was electrically propelled, with two crewmen in <a href="diving_suits" title="wikilink">diving suits</a> riding astride. They steered the <a class="uri" href="torpedo" title="wikilink">torpedo</a> at slow speed to the enemy ship. The detachable <a class="uri" href="warhead" title="wikilink">warhead</a> was then used as a <a href="limpet_mine" title="wikilink">limpet mine</a>. They then rode the torpedo away.</p>

<p>In operation, the <em>Maiale</em> torpedo was carried by another vessel (usually a normal submarine), and launched near the target. Most manned torpedo operations were at night and during the <a href="new_moon" title="wikilink">new moon</a> to cut down the risk of being seen.</p>

<p>The idea was successfully applied by the Italian navy (<em><a href="Regia_Marina" title="wikilink">Regia Marina</a></em>) early in World War II and then copied by the British when they discovered how powerful this new weapon was after three Italian SCL's successfully forced the harbour of Alexandria and sank the two English battleships "Queen Elizabeth" and "Valiant," and the tanker "Sagona." The official Italian name for their craft was "Siluro a Lenta Corsa" (SLC or "Slow-running torpedo"), but the Italian operators nicknamed it "Maiale" (Italian for "pig"; plural "maiali"), after their inventor <a href="Teseo_Tesei" title="wikilink">Teseo Tesei</a> angrily called the SLC thus, when it had just been difficult to steer. The British copies were named "chariots".</p>
<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>

<p> A typical manned torpedo has a propeller and <a href="Diving_plane" title="wikilink">hydroplanes</a> at the rear, side hydroplanes in front, and a control panel and controls for its front rider. It usually has two riders who sit facing forwards. It has <a class="uri" href="navigation" title="wikilink">navigation</a> aids such as a <a class="uri" href="compass" title="wikilink">compass</a>, and nowadays modern aids such as <a class="uri" href="sonar" title="wikilink">sonar</a> and <a class="uri" href="GPS" title="wikilink">GPS</a> positioning and <a href="modulated_ultrasound" title="wikilink">modulated ultrasound</a> communications gear. It may have an air (or other <a href="breathing_gas" title="wikilink">breathing gas</a>) supply so its riders do not have to drain their own apparatus while they are riding it. In some the riders' seats are enclosed; in others the seats are open at the sides as in sitting astride a horse. The seat design includes room for the riders' <a class="uri" href="swimfins" title="wikilink">swimfins</a> (if used). There are <a href="Ballast_tank" title="wikilink">flotation tanks</a> (typically four: left fore, right fore, left aft, right aft), which can be flooded or blown empty to adjust <a class="uri" href="buoyancy" title="wikilink">buoyancy</a> and <a href="Yaw,_pitch,_and_roll" title="wikilink">attitude</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>1909: The British designer Commander <a href="Godfrey_Herbert" title="wikilink">Godfrey Herbert</a> received a patent for a manned torpedo. During World War I, it was rejected by the War Office as impracticable and unsafe.</li>
<li>1 November 1918: Two men of the <a href="Regia_Marina" title="wikilink">Regia Marina</a>, Raffaele Paolucci and <a href="Raffaele_Rossetti" title="wikilink">Raffaele Rossetti</a>, in diving suits, rode a primitive manned torpedo (nicknamed <em>Mignatta</em> or "leech") into the <a href="Austro-Hungarian_Navy" title="wikilink">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> base at <a href="Pula" title="wikilink">Pola</a> (<a class="uri" href="Istria" title="wikilink">Istria</a>), where they sank the Austrian <a class="uri" href="battleship" title="wikilink">battleship</a> <a href="SMS_Viribus_Unitis" title="wikilink"><em>Viribus Unitis</em></a> and the freighter <em>Wien</em> using limpet mines. They had no <a href="Scuba_set" title="wikilink">breathing sets</a> and they had to keep their heads above water, and thus they were discovered and taken prisoner.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>1938: In Italy the "1<sup>a</sup> Flottiglia Mezzi d'Assalto" (First Fleet Assault Vehicles) was formed as a result of the research and development efforts of two men - <a href="Major_Teseo_Tesei" title="wikilink">Major Teseo Tesei</a> and Major Elios Toschi of the Italian Royal Navy. The pair resurrected the idea of Paolucci and Rossetti.</li>
<li>1940: Commander Moccagatta of the Italian Royal Navy reorganised the 1st Fleet Assault Vehicles into the <em><a href="Decima_Flottiglia_MAS" title="wikilink">Decima Flottiglia MAS</a></em> (Tenth Light Flotilla of assault vehicles) or "X-MAS", under the command of Ernesto Forza. It secretly manufactured manned torpedoes and trained war frogmen, called <em>nuotatori</em> (Italian: "swimmers").</li>
<li>26 July 1941: An attack on <a href="Valletta" title="wikilink">Valletta Harbour</a> ended in disaster for the X MAS and Major Teseo Tesei lost his life.</li>
<li>19 December 1941: The Decima Flottiglia MAS attacked the port of <a href="Raid_on_Alexandria_(1941)" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a> with three <em>maiali</em>. The battleships  and <a href="HMS_Queen_Elizabeth_(1913)" title="wikilink"><em>Queen Elizabeth</em></a> (and an 8,000-ton <a href="Tank_ship" title="wikilink">tanker</a>) were sunk in shallow water putting them out of action for many months. <a href="Luigi_Durand_de_la_Penne" title="wikilink">Luigi Durand de la Penne</a> and five other swimmers were taken prisoner. De la Penne was awarded the <a href="Gold_Medal_of_Military_Valor" title="wikilink">Gold Medal of Military Valor</a> after the war.</li>
<li>October 1942: Two British chariots were carried aboard the <em><a href="Shetland_Bus" title="wikilink">Shetland Bus</a></em> fishing-boat <em>Arthur</em> to attack the <em><a href="German_battleship_Tirpitz" title="wikilink">Tirpitz</a></em> on Operation <em>Title.</em> They were swung overboard once in Norwegian waters but both became detached from their tow-hooks in a gale and the operation was a total failure.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li>8 December 1942. An attack by three manned torpedoes from the <a href="Italian_auxiliary_ship_Olterra" title="wikilink">auxiliary ship <em>Olterra</em></a> against British naval targets was thwarted in <a class="uri" href="Gibraltar" title="wikilink">Gibraltar</a>. Three divers were killed by depth charges when the British harbour defence "reacted furiously" to the attack. Among the dead were Lt Licio Visintini, commander of the divers unit on board the <em>Olterra</em>, Petty Officer Giovanni Magro and Sergeant Salvatore Leone, from <a class="uri" href="Taormina" title="wikilink">Taormina</a>, Sicily. Leone's body was never found. Sgt Leone was awarded the <em>Medaglia d'oro al Valor Militare</em> and a memorial was erected in the Community Gardens in Taormina on the 50th anniversary of the attack. The memorial includes a rebuilt <em>maiale</em> and a description of the events, in three languages.</li>
<li>1–2 January 1943: British submarines <em>Thunderbolt, Trooper</em> and <em>P311</em> took part in Operation '' Principal.'' <em>P311</em> was lost en route to <a href="La_Maddelena" title="wikilink">La Maddelena</a> but the other two boats had some success at <a class="uri" href="Palermo" title="wikilink">Palermo</a>, launching two and three Chariots respectively. The <em>Ulpio Traiano</em> was sunk and the stern torn off <em>Viminale.</em> However the cost was high with one submarine and one chariot lost and all but two charioteers captured.</li>
<li>18 January 1943: <em>Thunderbolt</em> took two chariots to Tripoli for Operation <em>Welcome.</em> This was to prevent blockships being sunk at the harbour mouth, so denying access to the Allies. Again, partial success was achieved. This was the last operation in which chariots were carried in containers on British submarines, although some others followed with the chariots on deck without containers.</li>
<li>6 May &amp; 10 June 1943: Italian <em>maiali</em> from the <em>Olterra</em>, now under the command of Lt Ernesto Notari, sank six Allied merchant ships in Gibraltar, for a total of 42,000 tn.</li>
<li>2 October 1943: A bigger Italian frogman-carrier,  long and carrying four frogmen, called <em>Siluro San Bartolomeo</em>, or SSB, was going to attack Gibraltar, but Italy surrendered and the attack was called off.</li>
<li>21 June 1944: A British-Italian joint operation was mounted against shipping in <a href="La_Spezia" title="wikilink">La Spezia</a> harbour. The chariots were carried on board an MTB and the cruiser <em>Bolzano</em> was sunk.</li>
<li>6 July 1944: A German <a class="uri" href="Neger" title="wikilink">Neger</a> type vessel torpedoed the <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a> Minesweepers <a href="HMS_Magic" title="wikilink">HMS <em>Magic</em></a> and <em>Cato</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li>8 July 1944: A German Neger-type torpedo manned by Lt. Potthast heavily damaged the Polish <a href="light_cruiser" title="wikilink">light cruiser</a> <a href="HMS_Dragon_(D46)" title="wikilink">ORP <em>Dragon</em></a> off the <a class="uri" href="Normandy" title="wikilink">Normandy</a> beaches.</li>
<li>20 July 1944: Royal Navy destroyer <a href="HMS_Isis_(D87)" title="wikilink">HMS <em>Isis</em></a> was mined at anchor in <a href="Seine_Bay" title="wikilink">Seine Bay</a>. A German Human Torpedo was believed responsible.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
<li>27–28 October 1944: The British submarine <a href="HMS_Trenchant_(P331)" title="wikilink"><em>Trenchant</em></a> carried two <em>Mk 2 Chariots</em> (nicknamed <em>Tiny</em> and <em>Slasher</em>) to an attack on <a href="Phuket_Province" title="wikilink">Phuket</a> harbor in <a class="uri" href="Thailand" title="wikilink">Thailand</a>. See <a href="British_commando_frogmen#1944" title="wikilink">British commando frogmen</a> for more information about this attack. No manned torpedo operations in combat in any war are known with certainty after this date.</li>
<li>Immediate post-war period: The British Chariots were used to clear mines and wrecks in harbours.</li>

<p>One of those makes was <a href="tradename" title="wikilink">tradenamed</a> "Dolphin" and was made on the <a href="Isle_of_Wight" title="wikilink">Isle of Wight</a> in the 1960s or 1970s; both ends were tapered to a point.</p>

<p>Another type was USA-made and looked like a wartime chariot but its hull was thinner.</p>
