Xylitol kinase

In enzymology, a xylitol kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + xylitol 
 
 
 
  ADP + xylitol 5-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and xylitol, whereas its two products are ADP and xylitol 5-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:xylitol 5-phosphotransferase.
