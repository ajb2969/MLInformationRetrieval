The facets of all omnitruncated simplectic honeycombs are called permutahedra and can be positioned in n+1 space with integral coordinates, permutations of the whole numbers (0,1,..,n).
A
 
 
 
  lattice
The A
 
 
 
  lattice (also called A
 
 
 
 ) is the union of seven A6 lattices, and has the vertex arrangement of the dual to the omnitruncated 6-simplex honeycomb, and therefore the Voronoi cell of this lattice is the omnitruncated 6-simplex.

Projection by folding
The omnitruncated 6-simplex honeycomb can be projected into the 4-dimensional cubic honeycomb by a geometric folding operation that maps two pairs of mirrors into each other, sharing the same vertex arrangement:
