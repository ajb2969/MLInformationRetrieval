Arsenate reductase (azurin)

Arsenate reductase (azurin) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

arsenite + H2O + 2 azurinox 
 
 
 
  arsenate + 2 azurinred + 2 H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are arsenite, water, and azurinox, whereas its 3 products are arsenate, azurinred, and hydrogen ion.
Classification
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on phosphorus or arsenic in donor with a copper protein as acceptor.
Nomenclature
The systematic name of this enzyme class is arsenite:azurin oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called arsenite oxidase.
Structure and function
The enzime contains a molybdopterin centre comprising two molybdopterin guanosine dinucleotide cofactors bound to molybdenum, a [3Fe-4S] cluster and a [[Rieske protein|Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster]]. Also uses a c-type cytochrome or  as acceptors.
