N-succinylornithine carbamoyltransferase

N-succinylornithine carbamoyltransferase (, succinylornithine transcarbamylase, N-succinyl-L-ornithine transcarbamylase, SOTCase) is an enzyme with system name carbamoyl phosphate:N2-succinyl-L-ornithine carbamoyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

carbamoyl phosphate + N2-succinyl-L-ornithine 
 
 
phosphate + N-succinyl-L-citrulline
 

This enzyme is specific for N-succinyl-L-ornithine.
