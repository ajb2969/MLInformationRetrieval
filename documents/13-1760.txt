   6₂ knot      6₂ knot   In knot theory , the 6 2 knot is one of three prime knots with crossing number six, the others being the stevedore knot and the 6 3 knot . This knot is sometimes referred to as the Miller Institute knot , 1 because it appears in the logo 2 of the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science at the University of California, Berkeley .  The 6 2 knot is invertible but not amphichiral . Its Alexander polynomial is        Δ   (  t  )    =       -   t  2    +   3  t    -  3  -  1   +   3   t   -  1      -   t   -  2      ,        normal-Δ  t              superscript  t  2      3  t    3  1     3   superscript  t    1       superscript  t    2       \Delta(t)=-t^{2}+3t-3-1+3t^{-1}-t^{-2},\,     its Conway polynomial is        ∇   (  z  )    =     -   z  4    -   z  2    +  1    ,       normal-∇  z          superscript  z  4     superscript  z  2    1     \nabla(z)=-z^{4}-z^{2}+1,\,     and its Jones polynomial is        V   (  q  )    =        q  -  1   +   2   q   -  1      -   2   q   -  2      +   2   q   -  3      -   2   q   -  4      +   q   -  5      .
