   Exponentially equivalent measures      Exponentially equivalent measures   In mathematics , exponential equivalence of measures is how two sequences or families of probability measures are “the same” from the point of view of large deviations theory .  Definition  Let ( M , d ) be a metric space and consider two one- parameter families of probability measures on M , say ( μ ε ) ε >0 and ( ν ε ) ε >0 . These two families are said to be exponentially equivalent if there exist   a one-parameter family of probability spaces ((Ω, Σ ε , P ε )) ''ε>0 ,  two families of M -valued random variables ( Y ε ) ε >0 and ( Z ε ) ε >0 ,   such that   for each ε > 0, the P ε -law (i.e. the push-forward measure ) of Y ε is μ ε , and the P ε -law of Z ε is ν ε ,  for each δ > 0, “ Y ε and Z ε are further than δ apart” is a Σ ε - measurable event , i.e.           {   ω  ∈  Ω   |    d   (    Y  ε    (  ω  )    ,    Z  ε    (  ω  )    )    >  δ   }   ∈   Σ  ε    ,       conditional-set    ω  normal-Ω       d      subscript  Y  ε   ω      subscript  Z  ε   ω     δ     subscript  normal-Σ  ε     \big\{\omega\in\Omega\big|d(Y_{\varepsilon}(\omega),Z_{\varepsilon}(\omega))>%

Properties  The main use of exponential equivalence is that as far as large deviations principles are concerned, exponentially equivalent families of measures are indistinguishable. More precisely, if a large deviations principle holds for ( μ ε ) ε >0 with good rate function  I , and ( μ ε ) ε >0 and ( ν ε ) ε >0 are exponentially equivalent, then the same large deviations principle holds for ( ν ε ) ε >0 with the same good rate function I .
