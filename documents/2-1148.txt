   Cotangent bundle      Cotangent bundle   In mathematics , especially differential geometry , the cotangent bundle of a smooth manifold is the vector bundle of all the cotangent spaces at every point in the manifold. It may be described also as the dual bundle to the tangent bundle .  The cotangent sheaf  Smooth  sections of the cotangent bundle are differential one-forms .  Definition of the cotangent sheaf  Let M be a smooth manifold and let M √ó M be the Cartesian product of M with itself. The diagonal mapping Œî sends a point p in M to the point ( p , p ) of M √ó M . The image of Œî is called the diagonal. Let   ‚Ñê   ‚Ñê   \mathcal{I}   be the sheaf of germs of smooth functions on M √ó M which vanish on the diagonal. Then the quotient sheaf    ‚Ñê  /   ‚Ñê  2       ‚Ñê   superscript  ‚Ñê  2     \mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^{2}   consists of equivalence classes of functions which vanish on the diagonal modulo higher order terms. The cotangent sheaf is the pullback of this sheaf to M :        Œì   T  *   M   =    Œî  *    (   ‚Ñê  /   ‚Ñê  2    )     .        normal-Œì   superscript  T    M      superscript  normal-Œî      ‚Ñê   superscript  ‚Ñê  2       \Gamma T^{*}M=\Delta^{*}(\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^{2}).     By Taylor's theorem , this is a locally free sheaf of modules with respect to the sheaf of germs of smooth functions of M . Thus it defines a vector bundle on M : the cotangent bundle .  Contravariance in manifolds  A smooth morphism    œï  :   M  ‚Üí  N      normal-:  œï   normal-‚Üí  M  N     \phi\colon M\to N   of manifolds, induces a pullback sheaf      œï  *    T  *   N       superscript  œï     superscript  T    N    \phi^{*}T^{*}N   on M . There is an induced map of vector bundles      œï  *    (    T  *   N   )    ‚Üí    T  *   M      normal-‚Üí     superscript  œï       superscript  T    N       superscript  T    M     \phi^{*}(T^{*}N)\to T^{*}M   .  The cotangent bundle as phase space  Since the cotangent bundle X = T * M is a vector bundle , it can be regarded as a manifold in its own right. Because of the manner in which the definition of T * M relates to the differential topology of the base space M , X possesses a canonical one-form Œ∏ (also tautological one-form or symplectic potential ). The exterior derivative of Œ∏ is a symplectic 2-form , out of which a non-degenerate volume form can be built for X . For example, as a result X is always an orientable manifold (meaning that the tangent bundle of X is an orientable vector bundle). A special set of coordinates can be defined on the cotangent bundle; these are called the canonical coordinates . Because cotangent bundles can be thought of as symplectic manifolds , any real function on the cotangent bundle can be interpreted to be a Hamiltonian ; thus the cotangent bundle can be understood to be a phase space on which Hamiltonian mechanics plays out.  The tautological one-form  The cotangent bundle carries a tautological one-form Œ∏ also known as the Poincar√©  1 -form or Liouville  1 -form. (The form is also known as the canonical one-form , although this can sometimes lead to confusion.) This means that if we regard T * M as a manifold in its own right, there is a canonical section of the vector bundle T *( T * M ) over T * M .  This section can be constructed in several ways. The most elementary method is to use local coordinates. Suppose that x i are local coordinates on the base manifold M . In terms of these base coordinates, there are fibre coordinates p i : a one-form at a particular point of T * M has the form p i dx i ( Einstein summation convention implied). So the manifold T * M itself carries local coordinates ( x i , p i ) where the x are coordinates on the base and the p are coordinates in the fibre. The canonical one-form is given in these coordinates by        Œ∏   (  x  ,  p  )    =    ‚àë   ùî¶  =  1   n     p  i   d   x  i      .       subscript  Œ∏   x  p      superscript   subscript     ùî¶  1    n      subscript  p  i   d   superscript  x  i       \theta_{(x,p)}=\sum_{{\mathfrak{i}}=1}^{n}p_{i}dx^{i}.     Intrinsically, the value of the canonical one-form in each fixed point of T*M is given as a pullback . Specifically, suppose that  is the projection of the bundle. Taking a point in T x * M is the same as choosing of a point x in M and a one-form œâ at x , and the tautological one-form Œ∏ assigns to the point ( x , œâ) the value        Œ∏   (  x  ,  œâ  )    =    œÄ  *   œâ    .       subscript  Œ∏   x  œâ       superscript  œÄ    œâ     \theta_{(x,\omega)}=\pi^{*}\omega.     That is, for a vector v in the tangent bundle of the cotangent bundle, the application of the tautological one-form Œ∏ to v at ( x , œâ) is computed by projecting v into the tangent bundle at x using  and applying œâ to this projection. Note that the tautological one-form is not a pullback of a one-form on the base M .  Symplectic form  The cotangent bundle has a canonical symplectic 2-form on it, as an exterior derivative of the canonical one-form , the symplectic potential . Proving that this form is, indeed, symplectic can be done by noting that being symplectic is a local property: since the cotangent bundle is locally trivial, this definition need only be checked on     ‚Ñù  n   √ó   ‚Ñù  n        superscript  ‚Ñù  n    superscript  ‚Ñù  n     \mathbb{R}^{n}\times\mathbb{R}^{n}   . But there the one form defined is the sum of     y  i   d   x  i        subscript  y  i   d   subscript  x  i     y_{i}dx_{i}   , and the differential is the canonical symplectic form, the sum of    d   y  i   and  d   x  i       d   subscript  y  i   italic- and  d   subscript  x  i     dy_{i}{\and}dx_{i}   .  Phase space  If the manifold   M   M   M   represents the set of possible positions in a dynamical system , then the cotangent bundle      T  *    M       superscript  T    M    \!\,T^{*}\!M   can be thought of as the set of possible positions and momenta . For example, this is a way to describe the phase space of a pendulum. The state of the pendulum is determined by its position (an angle) and its momentum (or equivalently, its velocity, since its mass is not changing). The entire state space looks like a cylinder. The cylinder is the cotangent bundle of the circle. The above symplectic construction, along with an appropriate energy function, gives a complete determination of the physics of system.
