A quadrilateral.

In geometry, Bretschneider's formula is the following expression for the area of a general convex quadrilateral:











Here, a, b, c, d are the sides of the quadrilateral, s is the semiperimeter, and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are two opposite angles.
Bretschneider's formula works on any convex quadrilateral, whether it is cyclic or not.
The German mathematician Carl Anton Bretschneider discovered the formula in 1842. The formula was also derived in the same year by the German mathematician Karl Georg Christian von Staudt.
Proof of Bretschneider's formula
Denote the area of the quadrilateral by K. Then we have



Therefore



The Law of Cosines implies that


 
  because both sides equal the square of the length of the diagonal BD. This can be rewritten as



Adding this to the above formula for 
 
 
 
  yields



Following the same steps as in Brahmagupta's formula, this can be written as



Introducing the semiperimeter


 
  the above becomes


 
  and Bretschneider's formula follows.
Related formulas
Bretschneider's formula generalizes Brahmagupta's formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral, which in turn generalizes Heron's formula for the area of a triangle.
The trigonometric adjustment in Bretschneider's formula for non-cyclicality of the quadrilateral can be rewritten non-trigonometrically in terms of the sides and the diagonals p and q to give1
