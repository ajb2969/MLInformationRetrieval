   2-acylglycerophosphocholine O-acyltransferase      2-acylglycerophosphocholine O-acyltransferase   In enzymology , a 2-acylglycerophosphocholine O-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acyl-CoA + 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + phosphatidylcholine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine , whereas its two products are CoA and phosphatidylcholine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine O-acyltransferase . Other names in common use include 2-acylglycerol-3-phosphorylcholine acyltransferase , and 2-acylglycerophosphocholine acyltransferase . This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism .
