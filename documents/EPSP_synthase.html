<p>Thus, the two <a href="enzyme_substrate_(biology)" title="wikilink">substrates</a> of this enzyme are <a href="phosphoenolpyruvic_acid" title="wikilink">phosphoenolpyruvate</a> and 3-phospho-<a href="shikimic_acid" title="wikilink">shikimate</a>, whereas its two <a href="product_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">products</a> are <a class="uri" href="phosphate" title="wikilink">phosphate</a> and 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate.</p>
<h2 id="nomenclature">Nomenclature</h2>

<p>The enzyme belongs to the family of <a href="transferase" title="wikilink">transferases</a>, to be specific those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is <strong>phosphoenolpyruvate:3-phosphoshikimate 5-O-(1-carboxyvinyl)-transferase</strong>. Other names in common use include: </p>
<ul>
<li>5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase,</li>
<li>3-enolpyruvylshikimate 5-phosphate synthase,</li>
<li>3-enolpyruvylshikimic acid-5-phosphate synthetase,</li>

<li>enolpyruvylshikimate phosphate synthase, and</li>
<li>3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyl transferase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The enzyme participates in biosynthesis of the <a class="uri" href="aromatic" title="wikilink">aromatic</a> amino acids <a class="uri" href="phenylalanine" title="wikilink">phenylalanine</a>, <a class="uri" href="tyrosine" title="wikilink">tyrosine</a> and <a class="uri" href="tryptophan" title="wikilink">tryptophan</a>. The enzyme is a target for <a class="uri" href="herbicides" title="wikilink">herbicides</a> as these amino acids are only synthesized in plants and microorganisms. <a class="uri" href="Glyphosate" title="wikilink">Glyphosate</a> acts as a <a href="enzyme_inhibitor" title="wikilink">competitive inhibitor</a> for phosphoenolpyruvate and is used as a broad-spectrum <a href=":wikt:systemic" title="wikilink">systemic</a> herbicide.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="shikimate-pathway">Shikimate pathway</h2>

<p>The <a href="shikimic_acid" title="wikilink">shikimate pathway</a> is a seven step metabolic route used by bacteria, fungi, and plants for the biosythesis of <a href="aromatic_amino_acids" title="wikilink">aromatic amino acids</a> (<a class="uri" href="phenylalanine" title="wikilink">phenylalanine</a>, <a class="uri" href="tyrosine" title="wikilink">tyrosine</a>, and <a class="uri" href="tryptophan" title="wikilink">tryptophan</a>). This pathway is produced only by plants and micro-organisms; the genes coding for it are not in the mammalian genome.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <a href="Gut_flora" title="wikilink">Gut flora</a> of some animals contain EPSPS.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p>EPSP synthase is a monomeric enzyme. It is composed of two domains, which are joined by protein strands. This strand acts as a hinge, and can bring the two protein domains closer together. When a substrate binds to the enzyme, ligand bonding causes the two parts of the enzyme to clamp down around the substrate in the active site.</p>
<h2 id="reaction">Reaction</h2>

<p>EPSP synthase catalyzes the reaction which converts shikimate-3-phosphate plus phosphoenolpyruvate to 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP).</p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Glyphosate" title="wikilink">Glyphosate</a> is a chemical herbicide which kills plants by inhbiting the shikimate pathway. It targets EPSP synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of shikimate-3-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate into EPSP. Glyphosate is a <a href="competitive_inhibition" title="wikilink">competitive inhibitor</a> of the enzyme. Glyphosate resembles the <a href="transition_state" title="wikilink">transition state</a> that transforms the reactants into products in the reaction that is catalyzed by EPSP synthase. Hence glyphosate (as a <a href="transition_state_analog" title="wikilink">transition state analog</a>) binds more tightly to EPSP synthase than its natural substrate and thereby prevents binding of substrate to the enzyme.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>This binding leads to inhibition of the enzyme and shuts down the entire pathway. Eventually this results in plant death from lack of aromatic amino acids used to make pigments and <a class="uri" href="flavonoids" title="wikilink">flavonoids</a> the plant requires to survive. Glyphosate does not inhibit aromatic acid synthesis in animals and humans as they lack the shikimate pathway and aromatic amino acids are obtained from their diet.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>A version of the enzyme that both was resistant to glyphosate and that was still efficient enough to drive adequate plant growth was identified by <a class="uri" href="Monsanto" title="wikilink">Monsanto</a> scientists after much trial and error in an <em><a class="uri" href="Agrobacterium" title="wikilink">Agrobacterium</a></em> strain called CP4, which was found surviving in a waste-fed column at a glyphosate production facility; this version of enzyme, CP4 EPSPS, is the one that has been engineered into several <a href="genetically_modified_crops" title="wikilink">genetically modified crops</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

These pathways are found in bacteria, fungi, plants, and some protists but are absent in animals. Therefore, AAAs and some of their derivatives (vitamins) are essential nutrients in the human diet, although in animals Tyr can be synthesized from Phe by Phe hydroxylase....The absence of the AAA pathways in animals also makes these pathways attractive targets for antimicrobial agents and herbicides."<a href="#fnref4">↩</a></li>
