   Glutamine—fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (isomerizing)      Glutamine—fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (isomerizing)   In enzymology , a glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (isomerizing) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-glutamine + D-fructose 6-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-glutamate + D-glucosamine 6-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-glutamine and D-fructose 6-phosphate , whereas its two products are L-glutamate and D-glucosamine 6-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutamine:D-fructose-6-phosphate isomerase (deaminating) . Other names in common use include hexosephosphate aminotransferase , glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase (glutamine-forming) , glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (isomerizing) , D-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase , glucosaminephosphate isomerase , glucosamine 6-phosphate synthase , and GlcN6P synthase . This enzyme participates in glutamate metabolism and aminosugars metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 12 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , and .
