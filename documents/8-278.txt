   Chevalley basis      Chevalley basis   In mathematics, a Chevalley basis for a simple  complex  Lie algebra is a basis constructed by Claude Chevalley with the property that all structure constants are integers. Chevalley used these bases to construct analogues of Lie groups over finite fields , called Chevalley groups .  The generators of a Lie group are split into the generators H and E indexed by simple roots and their negatives    ±   α  i      plus-or-minus   subscript  α  i     \pm\alpha_{i}   . The relations among the generators are the following:       [   H   α  i    ,   H   α  j    ]   =  0        subscript  H   subscript  α  i     subscript  H   subscript  α  j     0    [H_{\alpha_{i}},H_{\alpha_{j}}]=0          [   H   α  i    ,   E   α  j    ]   =    α  j    (   H   α  i    )    E   α  j           subscript  H   subscript  α  i     subscript  E   subscript  α  j        subscript  α  j    subscript  H   subscript  α  i     subscript  E   subscript  α  j       [H_{\alpha_{i}},E_{\alpha_{j}}]=\alpha_{j}(H_{\alpha_{i}})E_{\alpha_{j}}          [   E   -   α  i     ,   E   α  i    ]   =   H   α  i          subscript  E     subscript  α  i      subscript  E   subscript  α  i      subscript  H   subscript  α  i      [E_{-\alpha_{i}},E_{\alpha_{i}}]=H_{\alpha_{i}}          [   E  β   ,   E  γ   ]   =   ±    (   p  +  1   )    E   β  +  γ            subscript  E  β    subscript  E  γ     plus-or-minus      p  1    subscript  E    β  γ        [E_{\beta},E_{\gamma}]=\pm(p+1)E_{\beta+\gamma}   where in the last relation   p   p   p   is the greatest positive integer such that    γ  -   p  β       γ    p  β     \gamma-p\beta   is a root and we consider     E   β  +  γ    =  0       subscript  E    β  γ    0    E_{\beta+\gamma}=0   if    β  +  γ      β  γ    \beta+\gamma   is not a root.  For determining the sign in the last relation one fixes an ordering of roots which respects addition, i.e., if    β  ≺  γ     precedes  β  γ    \beta\prec\gamma   then     β  +  α   ≺   γ  +  α      precedes    β  α     γ  α     \beta+\alpha\prec\gamma+\alpha   provided that all four are roots. We then call    (  β  ,  γ  )     β  γ    (\beta,\gamma)   an extraspecial pair of roots if they are both positive and   β   β   \beta   is minimal among all    β  0     subscript  β  0    \beta_{0}   that occur in pairs of positive roots    (   β  0   ,   γ  0   )      subscript  β  0    subscript  γ  0     (\beta_{0},\gamma_{0})   satisfying      β  0   +   γ  0    =   β  +  γ          subscript  β  0    subscript  γ  0      β  γ     \beta_{0}+\gamma_{0}=\beta+\gamma   . The sign in the last relation can be chosen arbitrarily whenever    (  β  ,  γ  )     β  γ    (\beta,\gamma)   is an extraspecial pair of roots. This then determines the signs for all remaining pairs of roots.  References   Simple Groups of Lie Type by Roger W. Carter, ISBN 0-471-50683-4   "  Category:Lie groups  Category:Lie algebras
