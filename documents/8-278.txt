Chevalley basis

In mathematics, a Chevalley basis for a simple complex Lie algebra is a basis constructed by Claude Chevalley with the property that all structure constants are integers. Chevalley used these bases to construct analogues of Lie groups over finite fields, called Chevalley groups.
The generators of a Lie group are split into the generators H and E indexed by simple roots and their negatives 
 
 
 
 . The relations among the generators are the following:











 
  where in the last relation 
 
 
 
  is the greatest positive integer such that 
 
 
 
  is a root and we consider 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  is not a root.
For determining the sign in the last relation one fixes an ordering of roots which respects addition, i.e., if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  provided that all four are roots. We then call 
 
 
 
  an extraspecial pair of roots if they are both positive and 
 
 
 
  is minimal among all 
 
 
 
  that occur in pairs of positive roots 
 
 
 
  satisfying 
 
 
 
 . The sign in the last relation can be chosen arbitrarily whenever 
 
 
 
  is an extraspecial pair of roots. This then determines the signs for all remaining pairs of roots.
