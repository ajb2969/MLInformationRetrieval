By type of notation
Numeral systems are classified here as to whether they use positional notation (also known as place-value notation), and further categorized by radix or base.
Standard positional numeral systems
(Figure)
A binary clock might use LEDs to express binary values. In this clock, each column of LEDs shows a binary-coded decimal numeral of the traditional sexagesimal time.

The common names are derived somewhat arbitrarily from a mix of Latin and Greek, in some cases including roots from both languages within a single name.1




Base

Name

Usage





2

Binary

Digital computing



3

Ternary

Cantor set (all points in [0,1] that can be represented in ternary with no 1s); counting Tasbih in Islam; hand-foot-yard and teaspoon-tablespoon-shot measurement systems; most economical integer base



4

Quaternary

Data transmission and Hilbert curves; Chumashan languages, and Kharosthi numerals



5

Quinary

Gumatj, Nunggubuyu, Kuurn Kopan Noot, and Saraveca languages; common count grouping e.g. tally marks



6

Senary

Diceware, Ndom, Kanum, and Proto-Uralic language (suspected)



8

Octal

Charles XII of Sweden, Unix-like permissions, DEC PDP-11, compact notation for binary numbers



10

Decimal

Most widely used by modern civilizations234



11

Undecimal

Jokingly proposed during the French Revolution to settle a dispute between those proposing a shift to duodecimal and those who were content with decimal



12

Duodecimal

Languages in the Nigerian Middle Belt Janji, Gbiri-Niragu, Piti, and the Nimbia dialect of Gwandara; Chepang language of Nepal, and the Mahl dialect of Maldivian; dozen-gross-great gross counting; hours and months timekeeping; years of Chinese zodiac; foot and inch.



13

Tridecimal

Conway base 13 function



14

Tetradecimal

Programming for the HP 9100A/B calculator5 and image processing applications6



15

Pentadecimal

Telephony routing over IP, and the Huli language



16

Hexadecimal

Base16 encoding; compact notation for binary data; tonal system



20

Vigesimal

Celtic, Maya, Inuit, Yoruba, Tlingit, and Dzongkha numerals; Santali, and Ainu languages



24

Tetravigesimal

Kaugel language



27

Heptavigesimal

Mapping the nonzero digits to the alphabet and zero to the space is occasionally used to provide checksums for alphabetic data such as personal names,7 to provide a concise encoding of alphabetic strings,8 or as the basis for a form of gematria.9



30

Trigesimal

The Natural Area Code



32

Duotrigesimal

Base32 encoding and the Ngiti language



36

Hexatrigesimal

Base36 encoding; use of letters with digits



60

Sexagesimal

Babylonian numerals; degrees-minutes-seconds and hours-minutes-seconds measurement systems; Ekari and Sumerian languages



64

Tetrasexagesimal

Base64 encoding



85

Pentoctogesimal

Ascii85 encoding
