   3-oxoadipate enol-lactonase      3-oxoadipate enol-lactonase   In enzymology , a 3-oxoadipate enol-lactonase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-oxoadipate enol-lactone + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-oxoadipate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-oxoadipate enol-lactone and H 2 O , whereas its product is 3-oxoadipate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-carboxymethylbut-3-en-4-olide enol-lactonohydrolase . Other names in common use include carboxymethylbutenolide lactonase , beta-ketoadipic enol-lactone hydrolase , 3-ketoadipate enol-lactonase , 3-oxoadipic enol-lactone hydrolase , and beta-ketoadipate enol-lactone hydrolase . This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation .  References      "  Category:EC 3.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
