Mutation (Jordan algebra)




Mutation (Jordan algebra)
In [[mathematics]], a '''mutation''', also called a '''homotope''', of a unital [[Jordan algebra]] is a new Jordan algebra defined by a given element of the Jordan algebra. The mutation has a unit if and only if the given element is invertible, in which 
 case the mutation is called a proper mutation or an isotope. Mutations were first introduced by Max Koecher in his Jordan algebraic approach to Hermitian symmetric spaces and bounded symmetric domains of tube type. Their functorial properties allow an explicit construction of the corresponding Hermitian symmetric space of compact type as a compactification of a finite-dimensional complex semisimple Jordan algebra. The automorphism group of the compactification becomes a complex subgroup, the complexification of its maximal compact subgroup. Both groups act transitively on the compactification. The theory has been extended to cover all Hermitian symmetric spaces using the theory of Jordan pairs or Jordan triple systems. Koecher obtained the results in the more general case directly from the Jordan algebra case using the fact that only Jordan pairs associated with period two automorphisms of Jordan algebras are required.
Definitions
Let A be a unital Jordan algebra over a field k of characteristic ≠ 2.See:




 For a in A define the Jordan multiplication operator on A by




and the quadratic representation Q(a) by



It satisfies



the fundamental identity



the commutation or homotopy identity



where



In particular if a or b is invertible then



It follows that A with the operations Q and R and the identity element defines a quadratic Jordan algebra, where a quadratic Jordan algebra consists of a vector space A with a distinguished element 1 and a quadratic map of A into endomorphisms of A, a ↦ Q(a), satisfying the conditions:






 
  ("fundamental identity")


 
  ("commutation or homotopy identity"), where 
 
 


The Jordan triple product is defined by



so that



There are also the formulas



For y in A the mutation Ay is defined to the vector space A with multiplication



If Q(y) is invertible, the mutual is called a proper mutation or isotope.
Quadratic Jordan algebras
Let A be a quadratic Jordan algebra over a field k of characteristic ≠ 2. Following , a linear Jordan algebra structure can be associated with A such that, if L(a) is Jordan multiplication, then the quadratic structure is given by Q(a) = 2L(a)2 − L(a2).
Firstly the axiom Q(a)R(b,a) = R(a,b)Q(a) can be strengthened to



Indeed applied to c, the first two terms give



Switching b and c then gives



Now let



Replacing b by a and a by 1 in the identity above gives



In particular



The Jordan product is given by



so that



The formula above shows that 1 is an identity. Defining a2 by a∘a = Q(a)1, the only remaining condition to be verified is the Jordan identity



In the fundamental identity



Replace a by a + t1, set b = 1 and compare the coefficients of t2 on both sides:



Setting b = 1 in the second axiom gives



and therefore L(a) must commute with L(a2).
Inverses
Let A be a unital Jordan algebra over a field k of characteristic ≠ 2. An element a in a unital Jordan algebra A is said to be invertible if there is an element b such that ab = 1 and a2b = a.See:

Elementary properties of proper mutations
{{-}} In fact See:







multiplication in the algebra Ay is given by

If e satisfies

Taking a = e gives



so that L(y) and L(e) commute. Hence y is invertible and e = y−1.
Now for y invertible set



Then



Moreover



Finally



since



Hence



Thus  is a unital quadratic Jordan algebra. It therefore corresponds to a linear Jordan algebra with the associated Jordan multiplication operator M(a) given by



This shows that the operators  satisfy the Jordan identity so that the proper mutation or isotope  is a unital Jordan algebra. The correspondence with quadratic Jordan algebras shows that its quadratic representation is given by .
Nonunital mutations
The definition of mutation also applies to non-invertible elements y. If A is finite-dimensional over R or C, invertible elements a in A are dense, since invertibility is equivalent to the condition that det Q(a) ≠ 0. So by continuity the Jordan identity for proper mutations implies the Jordan identity for arbitrary mutations. In general the Jordan identity can be deduced from Macdonald's theorem for Jordan algebras because it involves only two elements of the Jordan algebra. Alternatively, the Jordan identity can be deduced by realizing the mutation inside a unital quadratic algebra.See:








For a in A define a quadratic structure on A1 = A ⊕ k by



It can then be verified that  is a unital quadratic Jordan algebra. The unital Jordan algebra to which it corresponds has Ay as an ideal, so that in particular Ay satisfies the Jordan identity. The identities for a unital quadratic Jordan algebra follow from the following compatibility properties of the quadratic map  and the squaring map :

Hua's identity
Let A be a unital Jordan algebra. If a, b and a – b are invertible, then Hua's identity holds:1
{{-}} In particular if x and 1 – x are invertible, then so too is 1 – x−1 with



To prove the identity for x, set . Then . Thus 
 
 
 
  commutes with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Since , it also commutes with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Since ,

It follows that . Moreover 
 
 
 
  since 
 
 
 
 . So 
 
 
 
  commutes with 
 
 
 
  and hence . Thus  has inverse 
 
 
 
 .
Now let  be the mutation of A defined by a. The identity element of  is . Moreover an invertible element c in A is also invertible in  with inverse .
Let  in . It is invertible in A, as is . So by the special case of Hua's identity for x in 



Bergman operator
If A is a unital Jordan algebra, the Bergman operator is defined for a, b in A by2



If a is invertible then



while if b is invertible then



In fact if a is invertible




and similarly if b is invertible.
More generally the Bergman operator satisfies a version of the commutation or homotopy identity:
{{-}} and a version of the fundamental identity:
{{-}} There is also a third more technical identity:

Quasi-invertibility
Let A be a finite-dimensional unital Jordan algebra over a field k of characteristic ≠ 2.3 For a pair 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and  invertible define
{{-}} In this case the Bergman operator  defines an invertible operator on A and
{{-}} In fact



Moreover by definition  is invertible if and only if  is invertible. In that case
{{-}} Indeed



The assumption that 
 
 
 
  be invertible can be dropped since  can be defined only supposing that the Bergman operator 
 
 
 
  is invertible. The pair 
 
 
 
  is then said to be quasi-invertible. In that case  is defined by the formula



If 
 
 
 
  is invertible, then 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 . The fundamental identity implies that 
 
 
 
 . So by finite-dimensionality 
 
 
 
  is invertible. Thus 
 
 
 
  is invertible if and only if 
 
 
 
  is invertible and in this case
{{-}} In fact




so the formula follows by applying  to both sides.
As before 
 
 
 
  is quasi-invertible if and only if  is quasi-invertible; and in that case



If k = R or C, this would follow by continuity from the special case where 
 
 
 
  and  were invertible. In general the proof requires four identities for the Bergman operator:
{{-}} In fact applying 
 
 
 
  to the identity  yields



The first identity follows by cancelling 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The second identity follows by similar cancellation in

.
 

The third identity follows by applying the second identity to an element d and then switching the roles of c and d. The fourth follows because

.
 

In fact 
 
 
 
  is quasi-invertible if and only if 
 
 
 
  is quasi-invertible in the mutation . Since this mutation might not necessarily unital this means that when an identity is adjoint 
 
 
 
  becomes invertible in . This condition can be expressed as follows without mentioning the mutation or homotope:
 {{-}} In fact if 
 
 
 
  is quasi-invertible, then  satisfies the first identity by definition. The second follows because . Conversely the conditions state that in  the conditions imply that 
 
 
 
  is the inverse of 
 
 
 
 . On the other hand, 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  in . Hence 
 
 
 
  is invertible.
Equivalence relation
Let A be a finite-dimensional unital Jordan algebra over a field k of characteristic ≠ 2.4 Two pairs  with  invertible are said to be equivalent if  is invertible and .
This is an equivalence relation, since if 
 
 
 
  is invertible  so that a pair 
 
 
 
  is equivalent to itself. It is symmetric since from the definition . It is transitive. For suppose that  is a third pair with  invertible and . From the above



is invertible and



As for quasi-invertibility, this definition can be extended to the case where 
 
 
 
  and  are not assumed to be invertible.
Two pairs  are said to be equivalent if  is quasi-invertible and . When k = R or C, the fact that this more general definition also gives an equivalence relation can deduced from the invertible case by continuity. For general k, it can also be verified directly:

The relation is reflexive since 
 
 
 
  is quasi-invertible and .
The relation is symmetric, since .
The relation is transitive. For suppose that  is a third pair with  quasi-invertible and . In this case










so that  is quasi-invertible with

Structure groups
Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite-dimensional complex semisimple unital Jordan algebra. If 
 
 
 
  is an operator on 
 
 
 
 , let  be its transpose with respect to the trace form. Thus , ,  and . The structure group of A consists of g in 
 
 
 
  such that



They form a group 
 
 
 
 . The automorphism group Aut A of A consists of invertible complex linear operators g such that L(ga) = gL(a)g−1 and g1 = 1. Since an automorphism g preserves the trace form, g−1 = gt.

The structure group is closed under taking transposes g ↦ gt and adjoints g ↦ g*.
The structure group contains the automorphism group. The automorphism group can be identified with the stabilizer of 1 in the structure group.
If a is invertible, Q(a) lies in the structure group.
If g is in the structure group and a is invertible, ga is also invertible with (ga)−1 = (gt)−1a−1.
The structure group Γ(A) acts transitively on the set of invertible elements in A.
Every g in Γ(A) has the form g = h Q(a) with h an automorphism and a invertible.

The complex Jordan algebra A is the complexification of a real Euclidean Jordan algebra E, for which the trace form defines an inner product. There is an associated involution 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  which gives rise to a complex inner product on 
 
 
 
 . The unitary structure group Γu(A) is the subgroup of Γ(A) consisting of unitary operators, so that . The identity component of  is denoted by 
 
 
 
 . It is a connected closed subgroup of 
 
 
 
 .

The stabilizer of 1 in Γu(A) is Aut E.
Every g in Γu(A) has the form g = h Q(u) with h in Aut E and u invertible in A with u* = u−1.
Γ(A) is the complexification of Γu(A).
The set S of invertible elements u in A such that u* = u−1 can be characterized equivalently either as those u for which L(u) is a normal operator with uu* = 1 or as those u of the form exp ia for some a in E. In particular S is connected.
The identity component of Γu(A) acts transitively on S
Given a Jordan frame (ei) and v in A, there is an operator u in the identity component of Γu(A) such that uv = ∑ αi ei with αi ≥ 0. If v is invertible, then αi > 0.

The structure group Γ(A) acts naturally on X.5 For g in Γ(A), set



Then 
 
 
 
  is quasi-invertible if and only if  is quasi-invertible and



In fact the covariance relations for g with Q and the inverse imply that



if x is invertible and so everywhere by density. In turn this implies the relation for the quasi-inverse. If a is invertible then Q(a) lies in Γ(A) and if (a,b) is quasi-invertible B(a,b) lies in Γ(A). So both types of operators act on X.
The defining relations for the structure group show that it is a closed subgroup of 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 . Since , the corresponding complex Lie algebra contains the operators 
 
 
 
 . The commutators 
 
 
 
  span the complex Lie algebra of derivations of 
 
 
 
 . The operators 
 
 
 
  span 
 
 
 
  and satisfy  and 
 
 
 
 .
Geometric properties of quotient space
Let A be a finite-dimensional complex unital Jordan algebra which is semisimple, i.e. the trace form Tr L(ab) is non-degenerate. Let 
 
 
 
  be the quotient of 
 
 
 
  by the equivalence relation. Let  be the subset of X of classes 
 
 
 
 . The map , 
 
 
 
  is injective. A subset 
 
 
 
  of

 .
{{-}} The transition maps of the atlas with charts  are given by



and are injective and holomorphic since



with derivative



This defines the structure of a complex manifold on X because  on .
 {{-}} Indeed, all the polynomial functions  are non-trivial since . Therefore there is a 
 
 
 
  such that  for all i, which is precisely the criterion for  to lie in .
{{-}}  uses the Bergman operators to construct an explicit biholomorphism between X and a closed smooth algebraic subvariety of complex projective space.6 This implies in particular that 
 
 
 
  is compact. There is a more direct proof of compactness using symmetry groups.
Given a Jordan frame (ei) in E, for every a in A there is a k in U = Γu(A) such that  with  (and  if a is invertible). In fact, if (a,b) is in X then it is equivalent to k(c,d) with c and d in the unital Jordan subalgebra , which is the complexification of . Let 
 
 
 
  be the complex manifold constructed for . Because  is a direct sum of copies of C, Z is just a product of Riemann spheres, one for each . In particular it is compact. There is a natural map of Z into X which is continuous. Let Y be the image of Z. It is compact and therefore coincides with the closure of Y0 = Ae ⊂ A = X0. The set U⋅Y is the continuous image of the compact set U × Y. It is therefore compact. On the other hand, U⋅Y0 = X0, so it contains a dense subset of X and must therefore coincide with X. So X is compact.
The above argument shows that every (a,b) in X is equivalent to k(c,d) with c and d in  and k in . The mapping of Z into X is in fact an embedding. This is a consequence of 
 
 
 
  being quasi-invertible in  if and only if it is quasi-invertible in 
 
 
 
 . Indeed, if 
 
 
 
  is injective on A, its restriction to  is also injective. Conversely, the two equations for the quasi-inverse in  imply that it is also a quasi-inverse in 
 
 
 
 .
Möbius transformations
Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite-dimensional complex semisimple unital Jordan algebra. The group SL(2,C) acts by Möbius transformation on the Riemann sphere C ∪ {∞}, the one-point compactification of C. If g in SL(2,C) is given by the matrix



then



There is a generalization of this action of SL(2,C) to A and its compactification X. In order to define this action, note that SL(2,C) is generated by the three subgroups of lower and upper unitriangular matrices and the diagonal matrices. It is also generated by the lower (or upper) unitriangular matrices, the diagonal matrices and the matrix



The matrix J corresponds to the Möbius transformation  and can be written



The Möbius transformations fixing ∞ are just the upper triangular matrices. If g does not fix ∞, it sends ∞ to a finite point a. But then g can be composed with an upper unitriangular to send a to 0 and then with J to send 0 to infinity.
For an element 
 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , the action of 
 
 
 
  in SL(2,C) is defined by the same formula



This defines an element of 
 
 
 
  provided that 
 
 
 
 
  is invertible in 
 
 
 
 . The action is thus defined everywhere on 
 
 
 
  if g is upper triangular. On the other hand the action on X is simple to define for lower triangular matrices.See:









For diagonal matrices g with diagonal entries 
 
 
 
  and ,  is a well-defined holomorphic action on  which passes to the quotient X. On  it agrees with the Möbius action.


For lower unitriangular matrices, with off-diagonal parameter γ, define 
 
 
 
 . Again this is holomorphic on  and passes to the quotient X. When 
 
 
 
 
  and

if 
 
 
 
  is invertible, so this is an extension of the Möbius action.
 


For upper unitriangular matrices, with off-diagonal parameter β, the action on  is defined by 
 
 
 
 .  showed that this defined a complex one-parameter flow on 
 
 
 
 
 . The corresponding holomorphic complex vector field extended to 
 
 
 
 , so that the action on the compact complex manifold 
 
 
 
  could be defined by the associated complex flow. A simpler method is to note that the operator 
 
 
 
  can be implemented directly using its intertwining relations with the unitary structure group.

In fact on the invertible elements in A, the operator  satisfies . To define a biholomorphism j on X such that , it is enough to define these for 
 
 
 
  in some suitable orbit of Γ(A) or Γu(A). On the other hand, as indicated above, given a Jordan frame (ei) in E, for every a in A there is a k in U = Γu(A) such that  with .
The computation of 
 
 
 
 
  in the associative commutative algebra  is straightforward since it is a direct product. For  and , the Bergman operator on  has determinant . In particular

  in 
 
 
 
 , the extension is holomorphic and for 
 
 
 
 
 , 
{{-}} The holomorphic transformations corresponding to upper unitriangular matrices can be defined using the fact that they are the conjugates by J of lower unitriangular matrices, for which the action is already known. A direct algebraic construction is given in .
This action of 
 
 
 
  is compatible with inclusions. More generally if  is a Jordan frame, there is an action of  on Ae which extends to A. If  and , then 
 
 
 
  and

 .7 In particular the diagonal matrices give an action of  and .
Holomorphic symmetry group

 .  described 
 
 
 
  analogously to 
 
 
 
  in terms of generators and relations.

  is realized as a closed matrix group. It is the complexification of a compact Lie group without center, so a semisimple algebraic group. The identity component 
 
 
 
  of the compact group acts transitively on 
 
 
 
 , so that 
 
 
 
  can be identified as a Hermitian symmetric space of compact type.See:

  is. Moreover the above formula holds in this case.
For the proof, two more identities are required:






The first follows from a previous identity by applying the transpose. For the second, because of the transpose, it suffices to prove the first equality. Setting

Lie algebra of holomorphic vector fields
The compact complex manifold 
 
 
 
  is modelled on the space 
 
 
 
 . The derivatives of the transition maps describe the tangent bundle through holomorphic transition functions . These are given by , so the structure group of the corresponding principal fiber bundle reduces to 
 
 
 
 , the structure group of 
 
 
 
 .See:



 The corresponding holomorphic vector bundle with fibre 
 
 
 
 
  is the tangent bundle of the complex manifold 
 
 
 
 . Its holomorphic sections are just holomorphic vector fields on X. They can be determined directly using the fact that they must be invariant under the natural adjoint action of the known holomorphic symmetries of X. They form a finite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra. The restriction of these vector fields to X0 can be described explicitly. A direct consequence of this description is that the Lie algebra is three-graded and that the group of holomorphic symmetries of X, described by generators and relations in  and , is a complex linear semisimple algebraic group that coincides with the group of biholomorphisms of X.

The Lie algebras of the three subgroups of holomorphic automorphisms of

Let



Then, defining

  forms a complex Lie algebra with



This gives the structure of a 3-graded Lie algebra. For elements 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , the Lie bracket is given by



The group 
 
 
 
  of Möbius transformations of X normalizes the Lie algebra 
 
 
 
 . The transformation  corresponding to the Weyl group element 
 
 
 
  induces the involutive automorphism 
 
 
 
  given by



More generally the action of a Möbius transformation



can be described explicitly. In terms of generators diagonal matrices act as



upper unitriangular matrices act as



and lower unitriangular matrices act as



This can be written uniformly in matrix notation as



In particular the grading corresponds to the action of the diagonal subgroup of 
 
 
 
 , even with |α| = 1, so a copy of T.
The Killing form is given by



where  is the symmetric bilinear form defined by



with the bilinear form 
 
 
 
  corresponding to the trace form: 
 
 
 
 
 .
More generally the generators of the group 
 
 
 
  act by automorphisms on 
 
 
 
  as














{{-}} The nondegeneracy of the Killing form is immediate from the explicit formula. By Cartan's criterion, 
 
 
 
  is semisimple. In the next section the group 
 
 
 
  is realized as the complexification of a connected compact Lie group 
 
 
 
  with trivial center, so semisimple. This gives a direct means to verify semisimplicity. The group H also acts transitively on X.
{{-}} To prove that 
 
 
 
 
  exhausts the holomorphic vector fields on 
 
 
 
 , note the group T acts on holomorphic vector fields. The restriction of such a vector field to  gives a holomorphic map of A into A. The power series expansion around 0 is a convergent sum of homogeneous parts of degree 
 
 
 
 . The action of 
 
 
 
  scales the part of degree 
 
 
 
  by . By taking Fourier coefficients with respect to T, the part of degree m is also a holomorphic vector field. Since conjugation by 
 
 
 
 
  gives the inverse on 
 
 
 
 , it follows that the only possible degrees are 0, 1 and 2. Degree 0 is accounted for by the constant fields. Since conjugation by 
 
 
 
  interchanges degree 0 and degree 2, it follows that 
 
 
 
  account for all these holomorphic vector fields. Any further holomorphic vector field would have to appear in degree 1 and so would have the form 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . Conjugation by J would give another such map N. Moreover . But then



Set  and . Then



It follows that  lies in 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 
  and hence that 
 
 
 
  lies in 
 
 
 
 . So 
 
 
 
  is exactly the space of holomorphic vector fields on X.
Compact real form

The group 
 
 
 
  can thus be identified with its image in GL

Let

This is a period 2 conjugate-linear automorphism of the Lie algebra. It induces an automorphism of

Let

 . Let  be the diagonal torus associated with a Jordan frame in E. The action of  is compatible with 
 
 
 
  which sends a unimodular matrix 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 
 . In particular this gives a homomorphism of  into 
 
 
 
 .
Now every matrix 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  can be written as a product



The factor in the middle gives another maximal torus in 
 
 
 
  obtained by conjugating by 
 
 
 
 . If  with |αi| = 1, then 
 
 
 
  gives the action of the diagonal torus  and corresponds to an element of 
 
 
 
 . The element 
 
 
 
  lies in  and its image is a Möbius transformation 
 
 
 
  lying in 
 
 
 
 . Thus 
 
 
 
  is another torus in

  coincides with the image of .
{{-}} Since  for the compact complex manifold corresponding to , if follows that

 . In particular H is compact and connected since both K and S are. Because it is a closed subgroup of U

They are equal because all skew-adjoint derivations of

  given by . Since 
 
 
 
  is invariant under 
 
 
 
  so is its orthogonal complement. They are both ideals in 
 
 
 
 , so the Lie bracket between them must vanjsh. But then any derivation in the orthogonal complement would have 0 Lie bracket with

{{-}} The formulas above for the action of

Jordan algebras with involution
The preceding theory describes irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type in terms of unital Jordan algebras. In  general Hermitian symmetric spaces are described by a systematic extension of the above theory to Jordan pairs. In the development of , however, irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces not of tube type are described in terms of period two automorphisms of simple Euclidean Jordan algebras. In fact any period 2 automorphism defines a Jordan pair: the general results of  on Jordan pairs can be specialized to that setting.
Let τ be a period two automorphism of a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra E with complexification A. There are corresponding decompositions E = E+ ⊕ E− and A = A+ ⊕ A− into ±1 eigenspaces of τ. Let . τ is assumed to satisfy the additional condition that the trace form on 
 
 
 
  defines an inner product. For 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , define  to be the restriction of 
 
 
 
  to V. For a pair 
 
 
 
  in , define  and  to be the restriction of

The conditions for quasi-invertibility in

  is invertible. The quasi-inverse  is the same whether computed in

  of holomorphic vector fields on  is a 3-graded Lie algebra,



Restricted to 
 
 
 
  the components are generated as before by the constant functions into 
 
 
 
 , by the operators  and by the operators . The Lie brackets are given by exactly the same formula as before.
The spectral decomposition in  and 
 
 
 
  is accomplished using tripotents, i.e. elements 
 
 
 
  such that . In this case  is an idempotent in . There is a Pierce decomposition  into eigenspaces of

  and

  leaves the eigenspaces above invariant. In fact  acts as 0 on , as 1/4 on  and 1 on . This induces a Pierce decomposition . The subspace  becomes a Euclidean Jordan algebra with unit 
 
 
 
  under the mutation Jordan product }.
Two tripotents  and  are said to be orthogonal if all the operators 
 
 
 
  when a and b are powers of  and  and if the corresponding idempotents  and  are orthogonal. In this case  and  generate a commutative associative algebra and , since . Let 
 
 
 
  be in . Let 
 
 
 
  be the finite-dimensional real subspace spanned by odd powers of

  with 
 
 
 
  odd powers of 
 
 
 
  act on 
 
 
 
 , so can be simultaneously diagonalized by an orthonormal basis . Since  is a positive multiple of , rescaling if necessary,  can be chosen to be a tripotent. They form an orthogonal family by construction. Since 
 
 
 
  is in 
 
 
 
 , it can be written  with  real. These are called the eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
  (with respect to τ). Any other tripotent 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  has the form  with , so the  are up to sign the minimal tripotents in 
 
 
 
 .
A maximal family of orthogonal tripotents in  is called a Jordan frame. The tripotents are necessarily minimal. All Jordan frames have the same number of elements, called the rank of . Any two frames are related by an element in the subgroup of the structure group of  preserving the trace form. For a given Jordan frame , any element 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  can be written in the form  with  and 
 
 
 
  an operator in . The spectral norm of 
 
 
 
  is defined by ||a|| = sup αi and is independent of choices. Its square equals the operator norm of . Thus 
 
 
 
  becomes a complex normed space with open unit ball .
Note that for 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , the operator 
 
 
 
  is self-adjoint so that the norm |||| = ||
 
 
 
 ||n. Since , it follows that |||| = ||
 
 
 
 ||n. In particular the spectral norm of  in 
 
 
 
  is the square root of the spectral norm of . It follows that the spectral norm of 
 
 
 
  is the same whether calculated in 
 
 
 
  or . Since  preserves both norms, the spectral norm on  is obtained by restricting the spectral norm on 
 
 
 
 .
For a Jordan frame , let . There is an action of  on  which extends to V. If  and , then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  give the action of the product of the lower and upper unitriangular matrices. If  with , then the corresponding product of diagonal matrices act as , where .14 In particular the diagonal matrices give an action of  and .
As in the case without an automorphism τ, there is an automorphism θ of . The same arguments show that the fixed point subgroup  is generated by  and the image of . It is a compact connected Lie group. It acts transitively on ; the stabilizer of

  is the Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type dual to .

The Hermitian symmetric space of non-compact type have an unbounded realization, analogous the upper half-plane in C. Möbius transformations in 
 
 
 
  corresponding to the Cayley transform and its inverse give biholomorphisms of the Riemann sphere exchanging the unit disk and the upper halfplane. When the Hermitian symmetric space is of tube type the same Möbius transformations map the disk

For Hermitian symmetric space not of tube type there is no action of 
 
 
 
  on X, so no analogous Cayley transform. A partial Cayley transform can be defined in that case for any given maximal tripotent  in . It takes the disk  in  onto a Siegel domain of the second kind.
In this case  is a Euclidean Jordan algebra and there is symmetric -valued bilinear form on  such that the corresponding quadratic form 
 
 
 
  takes values in its positive cone . The Siegel domain consists of pairs 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  lies in . The quadratic form 
 
 
 
  on  and the squaring operation on  are given by . The positive cone  corresponds to

Examples
For simple Euclidean Jordan algebras

In fact let

The general case is a direct sum of these two cases.

  sends (

In particular V1 is identified with U2 and V2 with U1. Moreover they are V1 and U1 are orthogonal with respect to the symmetric bilinear form on (. Hence the idempotent 
 
 
 
  satisfies . So

The general case is a direct sum of these two cases.

 ) to (

 ), the map corresponding to  sends (

 ) and the map corresponding to 
 
 
 
  sends (

 ). It follows that the map corresponding to 
 
 
 
  sends (

Type II2n. A is the Jordan algebra of 2n × 2n skew-symmetric complex matrices  and Jordan product 
 
 
 
  where the unit is given by 
 
 
 
 . It is the complexification of , the Euclidean Jordan algebra of self-adjoint n × n matrices with entries in the quaternions. This is discussed in  and .
Type IVn. A is the Jordan algebra  with Jordan product 
 
 
 
 . It is the complexication of the rank 2 Euclidean Jordan algebra defined by the same formulas but with real coefficients. This is discussed in .
Type VI. The complexified Albert algebra. This is discussed in ,  and .
The Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type 
 
 
 
  for simple Euclidean Jordan algebras 
 
 
 
  with period two automorphism can be described explicitly as follows, using Cartan's classification.17
Type Ip,q. Let F be the space of q by p matrices over R with p ≠ q. This corresponds to the automorphism of E = Hp + q(R) given by conjugating by the diagonal matrix with p diagonal entries equal to 1 and q to −1. Without loss of generality 
 
 
 
  can be taken greater than 
 
 
 
 . The structure is given by the triple product . The space X can be identified with the Grassmannian of 
 
 
 
 -dimensional subspace of . This has a natural embedding in  by adding 0's in the last 
 
 
 
  coordinates. Since any 
 
 
 
 -dimensional subspace of  can be represented in the form [|
 
 
 
 ], the same is true for subspaces lying in . The last 
 
 
 
  rows of 
 
 
 
  must vanish and the mapping does not change if the last 
 
 
 
  rows of 
 
 
 
  are set equal to zero. So a similar representation holds for mappings, but now with q by p matrices. Exactly as when 
 
 
 
 , it follows that there is an action of 
 
 
 
  by fractional linear transformations.See:





Type IIn F is the space of real skew-symmetric m by m matrices. After removing a factor of √(-1), this corresponds to the period 2 automorphism given by complex conjugation on E = Hn(C).
Type V. F is the direct sum of two copies of the Cayley numbers, regarded as 1 by 2 matrices. This corresponds to the canonical period 2 automorphism defined by any minimal idempotent in E = H3(O).
