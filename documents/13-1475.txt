Montgomery curve

In mathematics the Montgomery curve is a form of elliptic curve, different from the usual Weierstrass form, introduced by Peter L. Montgomery in 1987.1 It is used for certain computations, and in particular in different cryptography applications.
Definition
 A Montgomery curve over a field

 
  is defined by the equation:




for certain 
 
 
 
 
  and with .
Generally this curve is considered over a finite field K (for example over a finite field of 
 
 
elements, ) with characteristic different from 2 and with   but they are also considered over the rationals with the same restrictions for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Montgomery arithmetic
It is possible to do some "operations" between the points of an elliptic curve: "adding" two points 
 
 
 
  consists on finding a third one 
 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 ; "doubling" a point consists on computing 
 
 
 
  (For more information about operations see The group law) and below.
A point 
 
 
 
  on the elliptic curve in the Montgomery form 
 
 
 
  can be represented in Montgomery coordinates 
 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  are projective coordinates and 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
Notice that this kind of representation for a point loses information: indeed, in this case, there is no distinction between the affine points

 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  because they are both given by the point 
 
 
 
 . However, with this representation it is possible to obtain multiples of points, that is, given 
 
 
 
 , to compute 
 
 
 
 .
Now, considering the two points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 : their sum is given by the point 
 
 
 
  whose coordinates are:




If 
 
 
 
 , then the operation becomes a "doubling"; the coordinates of 
 
 
 
 
  are given by the following equations:





The first operation considered above (addition) has a time-cost of 3M+2S, where M denotes the multiplication between two general elements of the field on which the elliptic curve is defined, while S denotes squaring of a general element of the field.
The second operation (doubling) has a time-cost of 2M+2S+1D, where D denotes the multiplication of a general element by a constant; notice that the constant is 
 
 
 
 , so 
 
 
 
 
  can be chosen in order to have a small D.
Algorithm and example
The following algorithm represents a doubling of a point 
 
 
 
  on an elliptic curve in the Montgomery form.
It is assumed that 
 
 
 
 . The cost of this implementation is 1M + 2S + 1*A + 3add + 1*4. Here M denotes the multiplications required, S indicates the squarings, and a refers to the multiplication by A.









Example
Let 
 
 
 
  be a point on the curve 
 
 
 
 . In coordinates 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 .
Then:









The result is the point 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
 .
Addition
Given two points 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  on the Montgomery curve 
 
 
 
  in affine coordinates, the point 
 
 
 
  represents, geometrically the third point of intersection between 
 
 
 
 
  and the line passing through 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . It is possible to find the coordinates 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , in the following way:
1) consider a generic line 
 
 
 
 
  in the affine plane and let it pass through 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (impose the condition), in this way, one obtains 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ;
2) intersect the line with the curve 
 
 
 
 
 , substituting the 
 
 
 
  variable in the curve equation with 
 
 
 
 ; the following  equation of third degree is obtained:


 
 .
As it has been observed before, this equation has three solutions that correspond to the 
 
 
 
  coordinates of 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . In particular this equation can be re-written as:



3) Comparing the coefficients of the two identical equations given above, in particular the coefficients of the terms of second degree, one gets:


 
 .
So, 
 
 
 
 
  can be written in terms of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , as:


 
 
 .
4) To find the 
 
 
 
  coordinate of the point 
 
 
 
  it is sufficient to substitute the value 
 
 
 
  in the line 
 
 
 
 . Notice that this will not give the point 
 
 
 
 
  directly. Indeed, with this method one find the coordinates of the point 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , but if one needs the resulting point of the sum between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then it is necessary to observe that
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 . So, given the point 
 
 
 
 , it is necessary to find 
 
 
 
 , but this can be done easily by changing the sign to the 
 
 
 
  coordinate of 
 
 
 
 
 . In other words, it will be necessary to change the sign of the 
 
 
 
  coordinate obtained by substituting the value 
 
 
 
  in the equation of the line.
Resuming, the coordinates of the point 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are:




Doubling
Given a point 
 
 
 
  on the Montgomery curve 
 
 
 
 , the point 
 
 
 
  represents geometrically the third point of intersection between the curve and the line tangent to 
 
 
 
 
 ; so, to find the coordinates of the point 
 
 
 
  it is sufficient to follow the same method given in the addition formula; however, in this case, the line y=lx+m has to be tangent to the curve at 
 
 
 
 , so, if 
 
 
 
  with


 
 ,
then the value of l, which represents the slope of the line, is given by:



by the implicit function theorem.
So 
 
 
 
  and the coordinates of the point 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are:



 
 
 .
Equivalence with twisted Edwards curves
Let 
 
 
 
  be a field with characteristic different from 2.
Let 
 
 
 
  be an elliptic curve in the Montgomery form:




with 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 

and let 
 
 
 
  be an elliptic curve in the twisted Edwards form:



with 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 .
The following theorem shows the birational equivalence between Montgomery curves and twisted Edwards curves:2
Theorem (i) Every twisted Edwards curve is birationally equivalent to a Montgomery curve over 
 
 
 
 . In particular, the twisted Edwards curve 
 
 
 
  is birationally equivalent to the Montgomery curve 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 
 .
The map:






is a birational equivalence from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , with inverse:







Notice that this equivalence between the two curves is not valid everywhere: indeed the map 
 
 
 
  is not defined at the points 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  of the 
 
 
 
 .
Equivalence with Weierstrass curves
Any elliptic curve can be written in Weierstrass form.
So, the elliptic curve in the Montgomery form



 
 ,
can be transformed in the following way: divide each term of the equation for 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 , and substitute the variables x and y, with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively, to get the equation


 
 .
To obtain a short Weierstrass form from here, it is sufficient to replace u with the variable 
 
 
 
 :


 
 ;
finally, this gives the equation:


 
 .
Hence the mapping is given as
