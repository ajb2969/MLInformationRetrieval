   Size (statistics)      Size (statistics)   In statistics , the size of a test is the probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis . That is, it is the probability of making a Type I error . It is denoted by the Greek letter α (alpha). For a simple hypothesis ,      α  =  P   (  test rejects   H  0   |   H  0   )   .     fragments  α   P   fragments  normal-(  test rejects   subscript  H  0   normal-|   subscript  H  0   normal-)   normal-.    \alpha=P(\text{test rejects }H_{0}|H_{0}).\,     In the case of a composite null hypothesis , the size is the supremum over all null hypotheses.      α  =   sup   h  ∈   H  0     P   (  test rejects   H  0   |  h  )   .     fragments  α    subscript  supremum    h   subscript  H  0     P   fragments  normal-(  test rejects   subscript  H  0   normal-|  h  normal-)   normal-.    \alpha=\sup_{h\in H_{0}}P(\text{test rejects }H_{0}|h).\,     A test is said to have significance level    α   α   \alpha   if its size is less than or equal to   α   α   \alpha   . In many cases the size and level of a test are equal.  "  Category:Hypothesis testing  Category:Statistical terminology
