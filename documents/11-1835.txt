   Atwood number      Atwood number   The Atwood number ( A ) is a dimensionless number in fluid dynamics used in the study of hydrodynamic instabilities in density stratified flows. It is a dimensionless density ratio defined as      A  =     ρ  1   -   ρ  2      ρ  1   +   ρ  2         normal-A       subscript  ρ  1    subscript  ρ  2       subscript  ρ  1    subscript  ρ  2       \mathrm{A}=\frac{\rho_{1}-\rho_{2}}{\rho_{1}+\rho_{2}}     where      ρ  1     subscript  ρ  1    \rho_{1}   = density of heavier fluid      ρ  2     subscript  ρ  2    \rho_{2}   = density of lighter fluid  Field of application  Atwood number is an important parameter in the study of Rayleigh–Taylor instability and Richtmyer–Meshkov instability . In Rayleigh–Taylor instability, the penetration distance of heavy fluid bubbles into the light fluid is a function of acceleration time scale,    A  g   t  2       normal-A  g   superscript  t  2     \mathrm{A}gt^{2}    1 where g is the gravitational acceleration and t is the time.
