Rose–Vinet equation of state

The Rose–Vinet equation of state are a set of equations used to describe the equation of state of solid objects. It is an modification of the Birch–Murnaghan equation of state.12 The initial paper discusses how the equation only depends on four inputs: the isothermal bulk modulus

 
 , the derivative of bulk modulus with respect to pressure 
 
 
 
 , the volume 
 
 
 
 , and the thermal expansion; all evaluated zero pressure (
 
 
 
 ) and at a single (reference) temperature. And the same equation holds for all classes of solids and a wide range of temperatures.
Let the cube root of the specific volume be



then the equation of state is:



A similar equation was published by Stacey et al. in 1981.3
