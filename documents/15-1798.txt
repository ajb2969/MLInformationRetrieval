   Rose–Vinet equation of state      Rose–Vinet equation of state   The Rose–Vinet equation of state are a set of equations used to describe the equation of state of solid objects. It is an modification of the Birch–Murnaghan equation of state . 1 2 The initial paper discusses how the equation only depends on four inputs: the isothermal bulk modulus     B  0     subscript  B  0    B_{0}   , the derivative of bulk modulus with respect to pressure    B  0  ′     superscript   subscript  B  0   normal-′    B_{0}^{\prime}   , the volume    V  0     subscript  V  0    V_{0}   , and the thermal expansion; all evaluated zero pressure (    P  =  0      P  0    P=0   ) and at a single (reference) temperature. And the same equation holds for all classes of solids and a wide range of temperatures.  Let the cube root of the specific volume be      η  =    V   V  0    3       η     3     V   subscript  V  0       \eta=\sqrt[3]{\frac{V}{V_{0}}}     then the equation of state is:      P  =   3   B  0    (    1  -  η    η  2    )    e    3  2    (    B  0  ′   -  1   )    (   1  -  η   )          P    3   subscript  B  0       1  η    superscript  η  2     superscript  e      3  2      superscript   subscript  B  0   normal-′   1     1  η        P=3B_{0}\left(\frac{1-\eta}{\eta^{2}}\right)e^{\frac{3}{2}(B_{0}^{\prime}-1)(1%
 -\eta)}     A similar equation was published by Stacey et al. in 1981. 3  References    "  Category:Solid mechanics  Category:Equations     ↩  ↩  ↩
