K–omega turbulence model

In computational fluid dynamics, the k–omega (k–ω) turbulence model is a common two-equation turbulence model, that is used as a closure for the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS equations). The model attempts to predict turbulence by two partial differential equations for two variables, k and ω, with the first variable being the turbulence kinetic energy (k) while the second (ω) is the specific rate of dissipation (of the turbulence kinetic energy k).

The eddy viscosity νT, as needed in the RANS equations, is given by:  k/ω}}, while the evolution of k and ω is modelled as:
