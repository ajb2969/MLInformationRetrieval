   Amine sulfotransferase      Amine sulfotransferase   In enzymology , an amine sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + an amine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + a sulfamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and amine , whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and sulfamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:amine N-sulfotransferase . Other names in common use include arylamine sulfotransferase , and amine N-sulfotransferase . This enzyme participates in sulfur metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 2.8.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
