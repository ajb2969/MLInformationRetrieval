Table of spherical harmonics

This is a table of orthonormalized spherical harmonics that employ the Condon-Shortley phase up to degree l = 10. Some of these formulas give the "Cartesian" version. This assumes x, y, z, and r are related to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  through the usual spherical-to-Cartesian coordinate transformation:



Spherical harmonics
=== l = 01===



=== l = 12 ===

=== l = 56===

































=== l = 6===







































=== l = 7===

===l = 9===

























































===l = 10===































































Real spherical harmonics
For each real spherical harmonic, the corresponding atomic orbital symbol (s, p, d, f, g) is reported as well.
=== l = 078 ===



=== l = 1910===



=== l = 21112===



=== l = 313===



===l = 4===
