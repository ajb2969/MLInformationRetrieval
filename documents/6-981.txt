   Vector flow      Vector flow   In mathematics , the vector flow refers to a set of closely related concepts of the flow determined by a vector field . These appear in a number of different contexts, including differential topology , Riemannian geometry and Lie group theory. These related concepts are explored in a spectrum of articles:   exponential map (Riemannian geometry)   matrix exponential  exponential function   infinitesimal generator (→ Lie group)  integral curve (→ vector field)  one-parameter subgroup  flow (geometry)   geodesic flow  Hamiltonian flow  Ricci flow  Anosov flow   injectivity radius (→ glossary)   Vector flow in differential topology  Relevant concepts: (flow, infinitesimal generator, integral curve, complete vector field)  Let V be a smooth vector field on a smooth manifold M . There is a unique maximal flow  D → M whose infinitesimal generator is V . Here D ⊆ R × M is the flow domain . For each p ∈ M the map D p → M is the unique maximal integral curve of V starting at p .  A global flow is one whose flow domain is all of R × M . Global flows define smooth actions of R on M . A vector field is complete if it generates a global flow. Every vector field on a compact manifold without boundary is complete.  Vector flow in Riemannian geometry  Relevant concepts: (geodesic, exponential map, injectivity radius)  The exponential map   exp : T p M → M    is defined as exp( X ) = γ(1) where γ : I → M is the unique geodesic passing through p at 0 and whose tangent vector at 0 is X . Here I is the maximal open interval of R for which the geodesic is defined.  Let M be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold (or any manifold with an affine connection ) and let p be a point in M . Then for every V in T p M there exists a unique geodesic γ : I → M for which γ(0) = p and       γ  ˙    (  0  )    =  V   .         normal-˙  γ   0   V    \dot{\gamma}(0)=V.   Let D p be the subset of T p M for which 1 lies in I .  Vector flow in Lie group theory  Relevant concepts: (exponential map, infinitesimal generator, one-parameter group)  Every left-invariant vector field on a Lie group is complete. The integral curve starting at the identity is a one-parameter subgroup of G . There are one-to-one correspondences   {one-parameter subgroups of G } ⇔ {left-invariant vector fields on G } ⇔ g = T e G .   Let G be a Lie group and g its Lie algebra. The exponential map is a map exp : g → G given by exp( X ) = γ(1) where γ is the integral curve starting at the identity in G generated by X .   The exponential map is smooth.  For a fixed X , the map t    ↦   maps-to   \mapsto   exp( tX ) is the one-parameter subgroup of G generated by X .  The exponential map restricts to a diffeomorphism from some neighborhood of 0 in g to a neighborhood of e in G .  The image of the exponential map always lies in the connected component of the identity in G .   "  Category:Geodesic (mathematics)  Category:Differential topology  Category:Lie groups
