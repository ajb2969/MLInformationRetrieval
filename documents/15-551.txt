Whitham equation

In mathematical physics, the Whitham equation is a non-local model for non-linear dispersive waves:123



This integro-differential equation for the oscillatory variable η(x,t) is named after Gerald Whitham who introduced it as a model to study breaking of non-linear dispersive water waves in 1967.4
For a certain choice of the kernel K(x − ξ) it becomes the Fornberg–Whitham equation.
Water waves

For surface gravity waves, the phase speed c(k) as a function of wavenumber k is taken as:5







 c_\text{ww}(k) = \sqrt{ \frac{g}{k}\, \tanh(kh)},
  while  
 
 


with g the gravitational acceleration and h the mean water depth. The associated kernel Kww(s) is:6








 K_\text{ww}(s) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} c_\text{ww}(k)\, \text{e}^{iks}\, \text{d}k.


The Korteweg–de Vries equation emerges when retaining the first two terms of a series expansion of cww(k) for long waves with :7







 c_\text{kdv}(k) = \sqrt{gh} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{6} k^2 h^2 \right),





with δ(s) the Dirac delta function.
 


Bengt Fornberg and Gerald Whitham studied the kernel Kfw(s) – non-dimensionalised using g and h:8





 
   and  
 
 
 
   with  
 
 





The resulting integro-differential equation can be reduced to the partial differential equation known as the Fornberg–Whitham equation:9








 \left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} - \nu^2 \right)
 \left( 
   \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t}
   + \frac32\, \eta\, \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}
 \right)
 + \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}
 = 0.


This equation is shown to allow for peakon solutions – as a model for waves of limiting height – as well as the occurrence of wave breaking (shock waves, absent in e.g. solutions of the Korteweg–de Vries equation).1011
