   Trans-octaprenyltranstransferase      Trans-octaprenyltranstransferase   In enzymology , a trans-octaprenyltranstransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   all-trans-octaprenyl diphosphate + isopentenyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + all-trans-nonaprenyl diphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are all-trans-octaprenyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate , whereas its two products are diphosphate and all-trans-nonaprenyl diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (E)-octaprenyl-diphosphate:isopentenyl-diphosphate octaprenyltranstransferase . Other names in common use include all-trans-nonaprenyl-diphosphate synthase , solanesyl-diphosphate synthase , solanesyl pyrophosphate synthetase , SPP synthase , nonaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase , polyprenylpyrophosphate synthetase , terpenoidallyltransferase , terpenyl pyrophosphate synthetase , trans-octaprenyltranstransferase , and trans-prenyltransferase . This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of steroids .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 16 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
