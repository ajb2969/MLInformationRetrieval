   Sum of two squares theorem      Sum of two squares theorem   In number theory , the sum of two squares theorem says when an integer    n  >  1      n  1    n>1   can be written as a sum of two squares, that is when    n  =    a  2   +   b  2        n     superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2      n=a^{2}+b^{2}   for some integers    a  ,  b     a  b    a,b   .   An integer greater than one can be written as a sum of two squares if and only if in its prime decomposition there is no prime congruent to 3 (mod 4) raised to an odd power. 1    This theorem supplements Fermat's two-square theorem which says when a prime number can be written as a sum of two squares, in that it also covers the case for composite numbers .  See also   Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity . This identity entails that the set of all sums of two squares is closed under multiplication.
