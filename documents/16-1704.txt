Sum of two squares theorem

In number theory, the sum of two squares theorem says when an integer 
 
 
 
  can be written as a sum of two squares, that is when 
 
 
 
  for some integers 
 
 
 
 .

An integer greater than one can be written as a sum of two squares if and only if in its prime decomposition there is no prime congruent to 3 (mod 4) raised to an odd power.1


This theorem supplements Fermat's two-square theorem which says when a prime number can be written as a sum of two squares, in that it also covers the case for composite numbers.
