   Affine vector field      Affine vector field   An affine vector field (sometimes affine collineation or affine ) is a projective vector field preserving geodesics and preserving the affine parameter . Mathematically, this is expressed by the following condition:        (    ℒ  X    g   a  b     )    ;  c    =  0       subscript     subscript  ℒ  X    subscript  g    a  b      fragments  normal-;  c    0    (\mathcal{L}_{X}g_{ab})_{;c}=0     See also   Conformal vector field  Curvature collineation  Homothetic vector field  Killing vector field  Matter collineation  Spacetime symmetries   "  Category:Mathematical methods in general relativity
