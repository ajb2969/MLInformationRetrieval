Mehler kernel

Mehler's formula
defined a function1 \exp\left(-\frac{\rho^2 (x^2+y^2)- 2\rho xy}{(1-\rho^2)}\right)~,  |border |border colour = #0073CF |bgcolor=#F9FFF7}} and showed, in modernized notation,2 that it can be expanded in terms of Hermite polynomials

 
 (.) based on weight function exp(−
 
 
 
 ²) as



This result is useful, in modified form, in quantum physics, probability theory, and harmonic analysis.
Physics version
In physics, the fundamental solution, (Green's function), or  propagator of the Hamiltonian for the quantum harmonic oscillator is called the Mehler kernel. It provides the fundamental solution---the most general solution3

 
  to



The orthonormal eigenfunctions of the operator 
 
 
 
  are the Hermite functions,  Hn(x) exp(−x²/2) /√ }}, with corresponding eigenvalues (2
 
 
 
 +1), furnishing particular solutions



The general solution is then a linear combination of these; when fitted to the initial condition 
 
 
 
 , the general solution reduces to


 
  where the kernel 
 
 
 
  has the separable representation



Utilizing Mehler's formula then yields



On substituting this in the expression for 
 
 
 
  with the value exp(−2
 
 
 
 ) for 
 
 
 
 , Mehler's kernel finally reads ~\exp\Bigl(-\coth(2t)~(x^2+y^2)/2 + \text{cosech}(2t)~xy\Bigr). |border |border colour = #0073CF |bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}
When 
 
 
 
  = 0, variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  coincide, resulting in the limiting formula necessary by the initial condition,








As a fundamental solution, the kernel is additive,



This is further related to the symplectic rotation structure of the kernel 
 
 
 
 .The quadratic form in its exponent, up to a factor of −1/2, involves the simplest (unimodular, symmetric) symplectic matrix in Sp(2,ℝ). That is,


 
    where


 
  so it preserves the symplectic metric,



Probability version
The result of Mehler can also be linked to probability. For this, the variables should be rescaled as 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , so as to change from the 'physicist's' Hermite polynomials 
 
 
 
 (.) (with weight function exp(−
 
 
 
 ²)) to "probabilist's" Hermite polynomials 
 
 
 
 (.) (with weight function exp(−
 
 
 
 ²/2)). Then, 
 
 
 
  becomes



The left-hand side here is p(x,y)/p(x)p(y) where p(x,y) is the bivariate Gaussian probability density function for variables 
 
 
 
  having zero means and unit variances:


 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are the corresponding probability densities of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
There follows the usually quoted form of the result (Kibble 1945)4



This expansion is most easily derived by using the two-dimensional Fourier transform of 
 
 
 
 , which is



This may be expanded as


 
  The Inverse Fourier transform then immediately yields the above expansion formula.
This result can be extended to the multidimensional case (Kibble 1945, Slepian 1972, 5 Hörmander 1985 6).
Fractional Fourier transform
Since Hermite functions  are orthonormal eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform,


 
  in harmonic analysis and signal processing, they diagonalize the Fourier operator,



Thus, the continuous generalization for real angle 
 
 
 
  can be readily defined (Wiener, 1929;7 Condon, 19378), the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), with kernel



This is a continuous family of linear transforms generalizing the Fourier transform, such that, for 
 
 
 
 , it reduces to the standard Fourier transform, and for 
 
 
 
  to the inverse Fourier transform.
The Mehler formula, for 
 
 
 
  = exp(−i
 
 
 
 ), thus directly provides


 
  The square root is defined such that the argument of the result lies in the interval [−π /2, π /2].
If 
 
 
 
  is an integer multiple of 
 
 
 
 , then the above cotangent and cosecant functions diverge. In the limit, the kernel goes to a Dirac delta function in the integrand, 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 
 
  an even or odd multiple of 
 
 
 
 , respectively. Since 
 
 
 
 [
 
 
 
  ] = 
 
 
 
 (−
 
 
 
 ), 
 
 
 
 [
 
 
 
  ] must be simply 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  an even or odd multiple of 
 
 
 
 , respectively.
