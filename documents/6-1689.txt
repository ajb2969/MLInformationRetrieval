   Étale fundamental group      Étale fundamental group   The étale or algebraic fundamental group is an analogue in algebraic geometry , for schemes , of the usual fundamental group of topological spaces .  Topological analogue/informal discussion  In algebraic topology , the fundamental group π 1 ( X , x ) of a pointed topological space ( X , x ) is defined as the group of homotopy classes of loops based at x . This definition works well for spaces such as real and complex manifolds , but gives undesirable results for an algebraic variety with the Zariski topology .  In the classification of covering spaces, it is shown that the fundamental group is exactly the group of deck transformations of the universal covering space . This is more promising: finite  étale morphisms are the appropriate analogue of covering spaces . Unfortunately, an algebraic variety X often fails to have a "universal cover" that is finite over X , so one must consider the entire category of finite étale coverings of X . One can then define the étale fundamental group as an inverse limit of finite automorphism groups.  Formal definition  Let   X   X   X   be a connected and locally noetherian scheme , let   x   x   x   be a geometric point of    X  ,    X   X,   and let   C   C   C   be the category of pairs    (  Y  ,  f  )     Y  f    (Y,f)   such that    f  :   Y  →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→  Y  X     f\colon Y\to X   is a finite étale morphism from a scheme    Y  .    Y   Y.    Morphisms      (  Y  ,  f  )   →   (   Y  ′   ,   f  ′   )      normal-→   Y  f     superscript  Y  normal-′    superscript  f  normal-′      (Y,f)\to(Y^{\prime},f^{\prime})   in this category are morphisms    Y  →   Y  ′      normal-→  Y   superscript  Y  normal-′     Y\to Y^{\prime}   as schemes over    X  .    X   X.   This category has a natural functor to the category of sets, namely the functor        F   (  Y  )    =    Hom  X    (  x  ,  Y  )     ;        F  Y     subscript  Hom  X   x  Y     F(Y)=\operatorname{Hom}_{X}(x,Y);     geometrically this is the fiber of    Y  →  X     normal-→  Y  X    Y\to X   over    x  ,    x   x,   and abstractly it is the Yoneda functor  corepresented by    x  .    x   x.   The functor   F   F   F   is not representable, however, it is pro-representable, in fact by Galois covers of   X   X   X   . This means that we have a projective system     {    X  j   →   X  i    ∣   i  <  j  ∈  I   }     conditional-set   normal-→   subscript  X  j    subscript  X  i        i  j       I      \{X_{j}\to X_{i}\mid i   in   C   C   C   , indexed by a directed set     I  ,    I   I,   where the    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   are Galois covers of   X   X   X   , i.e., finite étale schemes over    X  ,    X   X,   such that     #    Aut  X    (   X  i   )     =   deg   (    X  i   /  X   )          normal-#    subscript  Aut  X    subscript  X  i      deg     subscript  X  i   X      \#\operatorname{Aut}_{X}(X_{i})=\operatorname{deg}(X_{i}/X)   . It also means that we have given an isomorphism of functors       F   (  Y  )    =     lim  →    i  ∈  I      Hom  C    (   X  i   ,  Y  )           F  Y     subscript  injective-limit    i  I      subscript  Hom  C    subscript  X  i   Y      F(Y)=\underrightarrow{\lim}_{i\in I}\operatorname{Hom}_{C}(X_{i},Y)   . In particular, we have a marked point    P  ∈     lim  ←    i  ∈  I     F   (   X  i   )         P    subscript  projective-limit    i  I      F   subscript  X  i       P\in\underleftarrow{\lim}_{i\in I}F(X_{i})   of the projective system.  For two such     X  i   ,   X  j       subscript  X  i    subscript  X  j     X_{i},X_{j}   the map     X  j   →   X  i      normal-→   subscript  X  j    subscript  X  i     X_{j}\to X_{i}   induces a group homomorphism      Aut  X    (   X  j   )    →    Aut  X    (   X  i   )       normal-→    subscript  Aut  X    subscript  X  j      subscript  Aut  X    subscript  X  i      \operatorname{Aut}_{X}(X_{j})\to\operatorname{Aut}_{X}(X_{i})   which produces a projective system of automorphism groups from the projective system    {   X  i   }      subscript  X  i     \{X_{i}\}   . We then make the following definition: the étale fundamental group      π  1    (  X  ,  x  )        subscript  π  1    X  x     \pi_{1}(X,x)   of   X   X   X   at   x   x   x   is the inverse limit         π  1    (  X  ,  x  )    =     lim  ←    i  ∈  I      Aut  X    (   X  i   )      ,         subscript  π  1    X  x      subscript  projective-limit    i  I      subscript  Aut  X    subscript  X  i       \pi_{1}(X,x)=\underleftarrow{\lim}_{i\in I}{\operatorname{Aut}}_{X}(X_{i}),     with the inverse limit topology.  The functor   F   F   F   is now a functor from   C   C   C   to the category of finite and continuous     π  1    (  X  ,  x  )        subscript  π  1    X  x     \pi_{1}(X,x)   -sets, and establishes an equivalence of categories between   C   C   C   and the category of finite and continuous     π  1    (  X  ,  x  )        subscript  π  1    X  x     \pi_{1}(X,x)   -sets. 1  Examples and theorems  The most basic example of a fundamental group is π 1 (Spec k ), the fundamental group of a field  k . Essentially by definition, the fundamental group of k can be shown to be isomorphic to the absolute Galois group Gal ( k sep / k ). More precisely, the choice of a geometric point of Spec ( k ) is equivalent to giving a separably closed extension field K , and the fundamental group with respect to that base point identifies with the Galois group Gal ( K / k ). This interpretation of the Galois group is known as Grothendieck's Galois theory .  More generally, for any geometrically connected variety X over a field k (i.e., X is such that X sep := X × k  k sep is connected) there is an exact sequence of profinite groups   1 → π 1 ( X sep ,    x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \overline{x}   ) → π 1 ( X ,    x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \overline{x}   ) → Gal( k sep / k ) → 1.   Schemes over a field of characteristic zero  For a scheme X that is of finite type over C , the complex numbers, there is a close relation between the étale fundamental group of X and the usual, topological, fundamental group of X ( C ), the complex analytic space attached to X . The algebraic fundamental group, as it is typically called in this case, is the profinite completion of π 1 ( X ). This is a consequence of the Riemann existence theorem , which says that all finite étale coverings of X ( C ) stem from ones of X . In particular, as the fundamental group of smooth curves over C (i.e., open Riemann surfaces) is well-understood, this determines the algebraic fundamental group. More generally, the fundamental group of a proper scheme over any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero is known, because an extension of algebraically closed fields induces isomorphic fundamental groups.  Schemes over a field of positive characteristic and the tame fundamental group  For an algebraically closed field k of positive characteristic, the results are different, since Artin-Schreier coverings exist in this situation. For example, the fundamental group of the affine line     𝐀  k  1     subscript   superscript  𝐀  1   k    \mathbf{A}^{1}_{k}   is not topologically finitely generated . The tame fundamental group of some scheme U is a quotient of the usual fundamental group of U which takes into account only covers that are tamely ramified along D , where X is some compactification and D is the complement of U in X . 2 3 For example, the tame fundamental group of the affine line is zero.  Further topics  From a categoric point of view, the fundamental group is a functor   { Algebraic Varieties } → { Profinite groups }.   The inverse Galois problem asks what groups can arise as fundamental groups (or Galois groups of field extensions). Anabelian geometry , for example Grothendieck 's section conjecture , seeks to identify classes of varieties which are determined by their fundamental groups. 4  The étale fundamental group π 1 admit a generalization to a kind of higher homotopy groups by means of the étale homotopy type. 5  See also   étale morphism  Topological space  Fundamental group  Fundamental group scheme   References        "  Category:Scheme theory  Category:Topological methods of algebraic geometry     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
