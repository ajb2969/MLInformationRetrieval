   Cmin      Cmin     C min is a term used in pharmacokinetics that usually refers to the minimum blood plasma concentration that a drug achieves in tested area after the drug has been administrated and prior to the administration of a second dose. C min is the opposite of C max , which is the maximum concentration that a drug achieves after dosing. C min has direct relationships with other minimum concentrations such as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and is required to be higher than those concentrations to achieve the minimum efficacy .  In most cases C min is directly measurable. At steady state the minimum plasma concentration can also be calculated using the following equation: 1        C   p  m  i  n    =     S  F  D   k  a      V  d    (    k  a   -  k   )     ×   {     e   -   k  τ      1  -   e   -   k  τ       -    e   -    k  a   τ      1  -   e   -    k  a   τ        }         subscript  C    p  m  i  n          S  F  D   subscript  k  a       subscript  V  d      subscript  k  a   k           superscript  e      k  τ       1   superscript  e      k  τ          superscript  e       subscript  k  a   τ       1   superscript  e       subscript  k  a   τ            C_{pmin}=\frac{SFDk_{a}}{V_{d}(k_{a}-k)}\times\{\frac{e^{-k\tau}}{1-e^{-k\tau}%
 }-\frac{e^{-k_{a}\tau}}{1-e^{-k_{a}\tau}}\}      C min is also an important parameter in bioavailability and bioequivalence studies, it is part of the pharmacokinetic information recommended for submission of investigational new drug applications. 2  References  "  Category:Pharmacokinetics     http://www.pharmpress.com/files/docs/clinical_pharmacokinetics_samplechapter.pdf ↩  http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/ .../Guidances/ucm070124.pdf ↩
