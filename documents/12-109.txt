   Large Veblen ordinal      Large Veblen ordinal   In mathematics, the large Veblen ordinal is a certain large countable ordinal , named after Oswald Veblen .  There is no standard notation for ordinals beyond the Feferman–Schütte ordinal Γ 0 . Most systems of notation use symbols such as ψ(α), θ(α), ψ α (β), some of which are modifications of the Veblen functions to produce countable ordinals even for uncountable arguments, and some of which are "collapsing functions".  The large Veblen ordinal is sometimes denoted by     ϕ   Ω  Ω     (  0  )        subscript  ϕ   superscript  normal-Ω  normal-Ω    0    \phi_{{\Omega^{\Omega}}}(0)   or    θ   (   Ω  Ω   )       θ   superscript  normal-Ω  normal-Ω     \theta(\Omega^{\Omega})   or    ψ   (   Ω   Ω  Ω    )       ψ   superscript  normal-Ω   superscript  normal-Ω  normal-Ω      \psi(\Omega^{\Omega^{\Omega}})   . It was constructed by Veblen using an extension of Veblen functions allowing infinitely many arguments.  References      "  Category:Ordinal numbers
