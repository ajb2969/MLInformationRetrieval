Relationship to Codex Boernerianus
The Greek text of both manuscripts is almost the same; the Latin text differs. Also lacunae omissions are paralleled to the sister manuscript Codex Boernerianus. According to Griesbach Augiensis was recopied from Boernerianus. According to Tischendorf two codices were recopied from the same manuscript. Scrivener enumerated 1982 differences between these two codices. Among textual scholars, there is a tendency to prefer Augiensis above Boernerianus. The codex is also similar to Codex Claromontanus, and again scholars favour the readings in Augiensis above those in Claromontanus.
History
Codex Augiensis is named after the monastery of Augia Dives in Lake Constance.11 In 1718 Richard Bentley (1662–1742) was its owner. The Greek text of the codex was edited by Scrivener in 1859.12 It was examined, described and collated by Tischendorf.13 E. M. Thompson edited a facsimile.14
The codex today is located in the library of Trinity College (Cat. number: B. XVII. 1) in Cambridge.1516
