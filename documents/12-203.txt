   Cheeger constant      Cheeger constant   In Riemannian geometry , the Cheeger isoperimetric constant of a compact  Riemannian manifold  M is a positive real number h ( M ) defined in terms of the minimal area of a hypersurface that divides M into two disjoint pieces. In 1970, Jeff Cheeger proved an inequality that related the first nontrivial eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on M to h ( M ). This proved to be a very influential idea in Riemannian geometry and global analysis and inspired an analogous theory for graphs .  Definition  Let M be an n -dimensional closed Riemannian manifold. Let V ( A ) denote the volume of an n -dimensional submanifold A and S ( E ) denote the n −1-dimensional volume of a submanifold E (commonly called "area" in this context). The Cheeger isoperimetric constant of M is defined to be        h   (  M  )    =    inf  E     S   (  E  )     min   (   V   (  A  )    ,   V   (  B  )    )       ,        h  M     subscript  infimum  E       S  E       V  A     V  B        h(M)=\inf_{E}\frac{S(E)}{\min(V(A),V(B))},     where the infimum is taken over all smooth n −1-dimensional submanifolds E of M which divide it into two disjoint submanifolds A and B . Isoperimetric constant may be defined more generally for noncompact Riemannian manifolds of finite volume.  Cheeger's inequality  The Cheeger constant h ( M ) and      λ  1    (  M  )    ,       subscript  λ  1   M    \scriptstyle{\lambda_{1}(M)},   the smallest positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian on M , are related by the following fundamental inequality proved by Jeff Cheeger :         λ  1    (  M  )    ≥     h  2    (  M  )    4    .         subscript  λ  1   M        superscript  h  2   M   4     \lambda_{1}(M)\geq\frac{h^{2}(M)}{4}.     This inequality is optimal in the following sense: for any h > 0, natural number k and ε > 0, there exists a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold M with the isoperimetric constant h ( M ) = h and such that the k th eigenvalue of the Laplacian is within ε from the Cheeger bound (Buser, 1978).  Buser's inequality  Peter Buser proved an upper bound for     λ  1    (  M  )        subscript  λ  1   M    \scriptstyle{\lambda_{1}(M)}   in terms of the isoperimetric constant h ( M ). Let M be an n -dimensional closed Riemannian manifold whose Ricci curvature is bounded below by −( n −1) a 2 , where a ≥ 0. Then         λ  1    (  M  )    ≤    2  a   (   n  -  1   )   h   (  M  )    +   10   h  2    (  M  )      .         subscript  λ  1   M       2  a    n  1   h  M     10   superscript  h  2   M      \lambda_{1}(M)\leq 2a(n-1)h(M)+10h^{2}(M).
