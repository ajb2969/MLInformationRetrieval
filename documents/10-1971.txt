   Gallate decarboxylase      Gallate decarboxylase   In enzymology , a gallate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyrogallol + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate , and two products , pyrogallol and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase (pyrogallol-forming) . Other names in common use include gallic acid decarboxylase , and gallate carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via coa ligation .  References     "  Category:EC 4.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure  Category:Phenolic acids metabolism
