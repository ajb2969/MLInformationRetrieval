   Littlewood's rule      Littlewood's rule   The earliest Revenue Management model is known as Littlewood’s rule , developed by Ken Littlewood while working at British Overseas Airways Corporation .  The two class model  Littlewood proposed the first static single resource quantity based RM model. 1 It was a solution method for the seat inventory problem for a single leg flight with two fare classes. Those two fare classes have a fare of    R  1     subscript  R  1    R_{1}   and    R  2     subscript  R  2    R_{2}   , whereby     R  1   >   R  2        subscript  R  1    subscript  R  2     R_{1}>R_{2}   . The total capacity is   C   C   C   and demand for class   j   j   j   is indicated with    D  j     subscript  D  j    D_{j}   . The demand is distributed via a distribution that is indicated with     F  j    (  )        subscript  F  j      F_{j}()   . The demand for class 2 comes before demand for class 1. The question now is how much demand for class 2 should be accepted so that the optimal mix of passengers is achieved and the highest revenue is obtained. Littlewood suggests closing down class 2 when the certain revenue from selling another low fare seat is exceeded by the expected revenue of selling the same seat at the higher fare. 2 In formula form this means: accept demand for class 2 as long as:       R  2   ≥   R  1   *  Prob   (   D  1   >  x  )      fragments   subscript  R  2     subscript  R  1    Prob   fragments  normal-(   subscript  D  1    x  normal-)     R_{2}\geq R_{1}*\text{Prob}(D_{1}>x)     where     R  2     subscript  R  2    R_{2}   is the value of the lower valued segment      R  1     subscript  R  1    R_{1}   is the value of the higher valued segment      D  1     subscript  D  1    D_{1}   is the demand for the higher valued segment and     x   x   x   is the capacity left  This suggests that there is an optimal protection limit    y  1  ⋆     superscript   subscript  y  1   normal-⋆    y_{1}^{\star}   . If the capacity left is less than this limit demand for class 2 is rejected. If a continuous distribution      F  j    (  x  )        subscript  F  j   x    F_{j}(x)   is used to model the demand, then    y  1  ⋆     superscript   subscript  y  1   normal-⋆    y_{1}^{\star}   can be calculated using what is called Littlewood’s rule :  {R_{1}}) |cellpadding |border |border colour = #50C878 |background colour = #ECFCF4}}  This gives the optimal protection limit, in terms of the division of the marginal revenue of both classes.  Alternatively bid prices can be calculated via      π   (  x  )   =   R  1   *  Prob   (   D  1   >  x  )      fragments  π   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)     subscript  R  1    Prob   fragments  normal-(   subscript  D  1    x  normal-)     \pi(x)=R_{1}*\text{Prob}(D_{1}>x)     Littlewood's model is limited to two classes. P. Belobaba developed a model based on this rule called Expected marginal seat revenue , abbreviated as EMSR, which is an   n   n   n   -class model 3  References  See also   Yield management  Expected marginal seat revenue   "  Category:Pricing     Pak, K. and N.
