   Notation in probability and statistics      Notation in probability and statistics   Probability theory and statistics have some commonly used conventions, in addition to standard mathematical notation and mathematical symbols .  Probability theory   Random variables are usually written in upper case roman letters: X , Y , etc.  Particular realizations of a random variable are written in corresponding lower case letters. For example x 1 , x 2 , …, x n could be a sample corresponding to the random variable X and a cumulative probability is formally written    P   (  X  >  x  )      fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  X   x  normal-)     P(X>x)   to differentiate random variable from realization.  The probability is sometimes written   ℙ   ℙ   \mathbb{P}   to distinguish it from other functions and measure P so as to avoid having to define " P is a probability" and    ℙ   (  A  )       ℙ  A    \mathbb{P}(A)   is short for    P   (   {  ω  :    X   (  ω  )    ∈  A   }   )       P   conditional-set  ω      X  ω   A      P(\{\omega:X(\omega)\in A\})   , where   ω   ω   \omega   is an event and    X   (  ω  )       X  ω    X(\omega)   a corresponding random variable.      ℙ   (   A  ∩  B   )       ℙ    A  B     \mathbb{P}(A\cap B)   or    ℙ   [   A  ∩  B   ]       ℙ   delimited-[]    A  B      \mathbb{P}[A\cap B]   indicates the probability that events A and B both occur.      ℙ   (   A  ∪  B   )       ℙ    A  B     \mathbb{P}(A\cup B)   or    ℙ   [   A  ∪  B   ]       ℙ   delimited-[]    A  B      \mathbb{P}[A\cup B]   indicates the probability of either event A or event B occurring ("or" in this case means one or the other or both ).  σ-algebras are usually written with upper case calligraphic (e.g.   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   for the set of sets on which we define the probability P )  Probability density functions (pdfs) and probability mass functions are denoted by lower case letters, e.g. f ( x ).  Cumulative distribution functions (cdfs) are denoted by upper case letters, e.g. F ( x ).  Survival functions or complementary cumulative distribution functions are often denoted by placing an overbar over the symbol for the cumulative      F  ¯    (  x  )    =   1  -   F   (  x  )            normal-¯  F   x     1    F  x      \overline{F}(x)=1-F(x)     In particular, the pdf of the standard normal distribution is denoted by φ( z ), and its cdf by Φ( z ).  Some common operators:   :* E[ X ] : expected value of X  :* var[ X ] : variance of X  :* cov[ X , Y ] : covariance of X and Y   X is independent of Y is often written    X  ⟂  Y     perpendicular-to  X  Y    X\perp Y   or    X  ⟂  ⟂  Y     fragments  X  perpendicular-to  perpendicular-to  Y    X\perp\!\!\!\perp Y   , and X is independent of Y given W is often written       X  ⟂  ⟂   Y   |  W     fragments  X  perpendicular-to  perpendicular-to  Y  normal-|  W    X\perp\!\!\!\perp Y\,|\,W   or      X  ⟂   Y   |  W     fragments  X  perpendicular-to  Y  normal-|  W    X\perp Y\,|\,W          P   (  A  ∣  B  )      fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-∣  B  normal-)     \textstyle P(A\mid B)   , the posterior probability , is the probability of   A   A   \textstyle A    given    B   B   \textstyle B   , i.e., after    B   B   \textstyle B   is observed.   Statistics   Greek letters (e.g. θ, β) are commonly used to denote unknown parameters (population parameters).  A tilde (~) denotes "has the probability distribution of".  Placing a hat, or caret, over a true parameter denotes an estimator of it, e.g.,    θ  ^     normal-^  θ    \widehat{\theta}   is an estimator for   θ   θ   \theta   .    The arithmetic mean of a series of values x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n is often denoted by placing an " overbar " over the symbol, e.g.    x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \bar{x}   , pronounced " x bar".  Some commonly used symbols for sample statistics are given below:  the sample mean     x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \bar{x}   ,  the sample variance  s 2 ,  the sample standard deviation  s ,  the sample correlation coefficient  r ,  the sample cumulants k r .   Some commonly used symbols for population parameters are given below:  the population mean μ ,  the population variance σ 2 ,  the population standard deviation σ ,  the population correlation  ρ ,  the population cumulants  κ r .    Critical values  The α-level upper critical value of a probability distribution is the value exceeded with probability α, that is, the value x α such that F ( x α ) = 1 − α where F is the cumulative distribution function. There are standard notations for the upper critical values of some commonly used distributions in statistics:   z α or z (α) for the Standard normal distribution  t α,ν or t (α,ν) for the t -distribution with ν degrees of freedom      χ   α  ,  ν   2     subscript   superscript  χ  2    α  ν     \chi^{2}_{\alpha,\nu}   or     χ  2    (  α  ,  ν  )        superscript  χ  2    α  ν     \chi^{2}(\alpha,\nu)   for the chi-squared distribution with ν degrees of freedom      F   α  ,   ν  1   ,   ν  2       subscript  F   α   subscript  ν  1    subscript  ν  2      F_{\alpha,\nu_{1},\nu_{2}}   or F(α,ν 1 ,ν 2 ) for the F-distribution with ν 1 and ν 2 degrees of freedom   Linear algebra   Matrices are usually denoted by boldface capital letters, e.g. A .  Column vectors are usually denoted by boldface lower case letters, e.g. x .  The transpose operator is denoted by either a superscript T (e.g. A T ) or a prime symbol (e.g. A ′).  A row vector is written as the transpose of a column vector, e.g. x T or x ′.
