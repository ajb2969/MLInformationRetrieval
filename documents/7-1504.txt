Plasma parameters define various characteristics of a plasma, an electrically conductive collection of charged particles that responds collectively to electromagnetic forces. Plasma typically takes the form of neutral gas-like clouds or charged ion beams, but may also include dust and grains.1 The behaviour of such particle systems can be studied statistically.2
Fundamental plasma parameters
All quantities are in Gaussian (cgs) units except energy expressed in eV and ion mass expressed in units of the proton mass 
 
 
 
 ; 
 
 
 
  is charge state; 
 
 
 
  is Boltzmann's constant; 
 
 
 
  is wavenumber; 
 
 
 
  is the Coulomb logarithm.
Frequencies

electron gyrofrequency, the angular frequency of the circular motion of an electron in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field:





ion gyrofrequency, the angular frequency of the circular motion of an ion in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field:





electron plasma frequency, the frequency with which electrons oscillate (plasma oscillation):





ion plasma frequency:





electron trapping rate:





ion trapping rate:





electron collision rate in completely ionized plasmas:





ion collision rate in completely ionized plasmas:





electron (ion) collision rate in slightly ionized plasmas:



 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a collision crossection of the electron (ion) on the operating gas atoms (molecules), 
 
 
 
  is the electron (ion) distribution function in plasma, and 
 
 
 
  is an operating gas concentration.
Lengths

Electron thermal de Broglie wavelength, approximate average de Broglie wavelength of electrons in a plasma:





classical distance of closest approach, the closest that two particles with the elementary charge come to each other if they approach head-on and each have a velocity typical of the temperature, ignoring quantum-mechanical effects:





electron gyroradius, the radius of the circular motion of an electron in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field:





ion gyroradius, the radius of the circular motion of an ion in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field:





plasma skin depth, the depth in a plasma to which electromagnetic radiation can penetrate:





Debye length, the scale over which electric fields are screened out by a redistribution of the electrons:





Ion inertial length, the scale at which ions decouple from electrons and the magnetic field becomes frozen into the electron fluid rather than the bulk plasma:





Free path is the average distance between two subsequent collisions of the electron (ion) with plasma components:



 
  where 
 
 
 
  is an average velocity of the electron (ion), and 
 
 
 
  is the electron or ion collision rate.
Velocities

electron thermal velocity, typical velocity of an electron in a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution:





ion thermal velocity, typical velocity of an ion in a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution:





ion sound velocity, the speed of the longitudinal waves resulting from the mass of the ions and the pressure of the electrons:



 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the adiabatic index, and here 
 
 
 
  is the number of degrees of freedom

Alfvén velocity, the speed of the waves resulting from the mass of the ions and the restoring force of the magnetic field:
