Legendre's formula

In mathematics, Legendre's formula gives an expression for the exponent of the largest power of a prime p that divides the factorial

 
 . It is named for Adrien-Marie Legendre.
Statement
Let p be a prime and n be a positive integer. Let 
 
 
 
  denote the  p-adic valuation of n. Then


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the floor function. Equivalently, if 
 
 
 
  denotes the sum of the standard base-p digits of n, then



Proof
Since 
 
 
 
  is the product of the integers 1 through n, we obtain at least one factor of p in 
 
 
 
  for each multiple of p in 
 
 
 
 , of which there are 
 
 
 
 . Each multiple of 
 
 
 
  contributes an additional factor of p, each multiple of 
 
 
 
  contributes yet another factor of p, etc. Adding up the number of these factors gives the infinite sum for 
 
 
 
 . The sum contains only finitely many nonzero terms, since 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
To obtain the second form, write 
 
 
 
  in base p. Then 
 
 
 
 , and therefore



Examples
For 
 
 
 
 , we obtain


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the number of 1s in the binary representation of n.
Applications
Legendre's formula can be used to prove Kummer's theorem.
It follows from Legendre's formula that the p-adic exponential function has radius of convergence 
 
 
 
 .
