   Legendre's conjecture      Legendre's conjecture    Legendre's conjecture , proposed by Adrien-Marie Legendre , states that there is a prime number between n 2 and ( n + 1) 2 for every positive integer  n . The conjecture is one of Landau's problems (1912) on prime numbers and remains unsolved.  Prime gaps  Legendre's conjecture is one of a family of results and conjectures related to prime gaps , that is, to the spacing between prime numbers.  The prime number theorem implies that the actual number of primes between n 2 and ( n + 1) 2 is asymptotic to n /ln( n ). Since this number is large for large n , this lends credence to Legendre's conjecture.  If Legendre's conjecture is true, the gap between any prime p and the next largest prime would always be at most on the order of    p      p    \sqrt{p}   ; in big O notation , the gaps are    O   (   p   )       O    p     O(\sqrt{p})   . Two stronger conjectures, Andrica's conjecture and Oppermann's conjecture , also both imply that the gaps have the same magnitude. It does not, however, provide a solution to the Riemann Hypothesis, but rather strengthens one of the implications of its correctness.  Harald Cramér  conjectured that the gaps are always much smaller, of the order     (   log  p   )   2     superscript    p   2    (\log p)^{2}   . If Cramér's conjecture is true, Legendre's conjecture would follow for all sufficiently large n . Cramér also proved that the Riemann hypothesis implies a weaker bound of    O   (    p    log  p    )       O      p     p      O(\sqrt{p}\log p)   on the size of the largest prime gaps. 1  Baker, Harman and Pintz proved that there is a prime in the interval    [  x  ,   x  +   O   (   x   21  /  40    )     ]     x    x    O   superscript  x    21  40        [x,\,x+O(x^{21/40})]   for all large   x   x   x   . 2  A table of maximal prime gaps shows that the conjecture holds to 10 18 . 3 A counterexample near 10 18 would require a prime gap fifty million times the size of the average gap.  Legendre's conjecture implies that at least one prime can be found in every half revolution of the Ulam spiral .
