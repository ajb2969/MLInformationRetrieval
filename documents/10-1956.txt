   Citramalyl-CoA lyase      Citramalyl-CoA lyase   In enzymology , a citramalyl-CoA lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (3S)-citramalyl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetyl-CoA + pyruvate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (3S)-citramalyl-CoA , and two products , acetyl-CoA and pyruvate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the oxo-acid-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (3S)-citramalyl-CoA pyruvate-lyase (acetyl-CoA-forming) . Other names in common use include citramalyl coenzyme A lyase , (+)-CMA-CoA lyase , and (3S)-citramalyl-CoA pyruvate-lyase . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism and c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 4.1.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
