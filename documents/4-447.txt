   Cross-polytope      Cross-polytope   In geometry , a cross-polytope , 1  orthoplex , 2  hyperoctahedron , or cocube is a regular , convex polytope that exists in any number of dimensions. The vertices of a cross-polytope are all the permutations of (±1, 0, 0, …, 0). The cross-polytope is the convex hull of its vertices. Its facets are simplexes of the previous dimension, while the cross-polytope's vertex figure is another cross-polytope from the previous dimension.  The n -dimensional cross-polytope can also be defined as the closed unit ball (or, according to some authors, its boundary) in the ℓ 1 -norm on R n :       {   x  ∈   ℝ  n    :     ∥  x  ∥   1   ≤  1   }   .     conditional-set    x   superscript  ℝ  n       subscript   norm  x   1   1     \{x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}:\|x\|_{1}\leq 1\}.     In 1 dimension the cross-polytope is simply the line segment [−1, +1], in 2 dimensions it is a square (or diamond) with vertices {(±1, 0), (0, ±1)}. In 3 dimensions it is an octahedron —one of the five convex regular polyhedra known as the Platonic solids . Higher-dimensional cross-polytopes are generalizations of these.

The 1- skeleton of a n -dimensional cross-polytope is a Turán graph  T (2 n , n ).  4 dimensions  The 4-dimensional cross-polytope also goes by the name hexadecachoron or 16-cell . It is one of six convex regular 4-polytopes . These 4-polytopes were first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schläfli in the mid-19th century.  Higher dimensions  The cross polytope family is one of three regular polytope families, labeled by Coxeter as β n , the other two being the hypercube family, labeled as γ n , and the simplices , labeled as α n . A fourth family, the infinite tessellations of hypercubes , he labeled as δ n .  The n -dimensional cross-polytope has 2 n vertices, and 2 n facets ( n −1 dimensional components) all of which are n −1 simplices . The vertex figures are all n − 1 cross-polytopes. The Schläfli symbol of the cross-polytope is {3,3,…,3,4}. The dihedral angle of the n -dimensional cross-polytope is      arccos   (    2  -  n   n   )           2  n   n     \arccos\left(\frac{2-n}{n}\right)   .  The number of k -dimensional components (vertices, edges, faces, …, facets) in an n -dimensional cross-polytope is given by (see binomial coefficient ):       2   k  +  1     (     n       k  +  1      )        superscript  2    k  1     binomial  n    k  1      2^{k+1}{n\choose{k+1}}     The volume of the n -dimensional cross-polytope is        2  n    n  !    .       superscript  2  n     n     \frac{2^{n}}{n!}.     There are many possible orthographic projections that can show the cross-polytopes as 2-dimensional graphs. Petrie polygon projections map the points into a regular 2n -gon or lower order regular polygons. A second projection takes the 2(n-1) -gon petrie polygon of the lower dimension, seen as a bipyramid , projected down the axis, with 2 vertices mapped into the center.

Kusner's conjecture states that this set of 2 d points is the largest possible equidistant set for this distance. 3  See also   List of regular polytopes  Hyperoctahedral group , the symmetry group of the cross-polytope   Notes  References    p. 296, Table I (iii): Regular Polytopes, three regular polytopes in n-dimensions (n>=5)   External links    Polytope Viewer (Click to select cross polytope.)
