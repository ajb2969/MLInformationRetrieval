   Asparagine—tRNA ligase      Asparagine—tRNA ligase   In enzymology , an asparagine-tRNA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-asparagine + tRNAAsn   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + L-asparaginyl-tRNAAsn   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , L-asparagine , and tRNA(Asn) , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and L-asparaginyl-tRNA(Asn) .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , to be specific those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in aminoacyl-tRNA and related compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-asparagine:tRNAAsn ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase , asparaginyl-transfer ribonucleate synthetase , asparaginyl transfer RNA synthetase , asparaginyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase , asparagyl-transfer RNA synthetase , and asparagine translase . This enzyme participates in alanine and aspartate metabolism and aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
