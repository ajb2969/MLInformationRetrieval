   Image (mathematics)      Image (mathematics)   thumb|upright=1.5| f is a function from domain X to codomain Y . The smaller oval inside Y is the image of f .   In mathematics , an image is the subset of a function 's codomain which is the output of the function on a subset of its domain . Precisely evaluating the function at each element of a subset X of the domain produces a set called the image of X under or through the function. The inverse image or preimage of a particular subset S of the codomain of a function is the set of all elements of the domain that map to the members of S .  Image and inverse image may also be defined for general binary relations , not just functions.  Definition  The word "image" is used in three related ways. In these definitions, f : X → Y is a function from the set  X to the set Y .  Image of an element  If x is a member of X , then f ( x ) = y (the value of f when applied to x ) is the image of x under f . y is alternatively known as the output of f for argument x .  Image of a subset  The image of a subset A ⊆ X under f is the subset f [ A ] ⊆ Y defined by (in set-builder notation ):       f   [  A  ]    =   {   y  ∈   Y    |   y  =   f   (  x  )   for some  x   ∈   A    }         f   delimited-[]  A     conditional-set    y  Y       y    f  x  for some  x        A       f[A]=\{\,y\in Y\,|\,y=f(x)\text{ for some }x\in A\,\}     When there is no risk of confusion, f [ A ] is simply written as f ( A ). This convention is a common one; the intended meaning must be inferred from the context. This makes the image of f a function whose domain is the power set of X (the set of all subsets of X ), and whose codomain is the power set of Y . See Notation below.  Image of a function  The image f [ X ] of the entire domain  X of f is called simply the image of f .  Inverse image  Let f be a function from X to Y . The preimage or inverse image of a set B ⊆ Y under f is the subset of X defined by        f   -  1     [  B  ]    =   {   x  ∈   X    |    f   (  x  )    ∈  B   }          superscript  f    1     delimited-[]  B     conditional-set    x  X       f  x   B      f^{-1}[B]=\{\,x\in X\,|\,f(x)\in B\}     The inverse image of a singleton , denoted by f −1 [{ y }] or by f −1 [ y ], is also called the fiber over y or the level set of y . The set of all the fibers over the elements of Y is a family of sets indexed by Y .  For example, for the function f ( x ) = x 2 , the inverse image of {4} would be {-2,2}. Again, if there is no risk of confusion, we may denote f −1 [ B ] by f −1 ( B ), and think of f −1 as a function from the power set of Y to the power set of X . The notation f −1 should not be confused with that for inverse function . In fact, the two are never the same, even if f is a bijection.  Notation for image and inverse image  The traditional notations used in the previous section can be confusing. An alternative 1 is to give explicit names for the image and preimage as functions between powersets:  Arrow notation        f  →   :    𝒫   (  X  )    →   𝒫   (  Y  )        normal-:   superscript  f  normal-→    normal-→    𝒫  X     𝒫  Y      f^{\rightarrow}:\mathcal{P}(X)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(Y)   with      f  →    (  A  )    =   {   f   (  a  )    |   a  ∈  A   }          superscript  f  normal-→   A    conditional-set    f  a     a  A      f^{\rightarrow}(A)=\{f(a)\;|\;a\in A\}          f  ←   :    𝒫   (  Y  )    →   𝒫   (  X  )        normal-:   superscript  f  normal-←    normal-→    𝒫  Y     𝒫  X      f^{\leftarrow}:\mathcal{P}(Y)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(X)   with      f  ←    (  B  )    =   {   a  ∈   X    |    f   (  a  )    ∈  B   }          superscript  f  normal-←   B    conditional-set    a  X       f  a   B      f^{\leftarrow}(B)=\{a\in X\;|\;f(a)\in B\}      Star notation        f  ⋆   :    𝒫   (  X  )    →   𝒫   (  Y  )        normal-:   subscript  f  normal-⋆    normal-→    𝒫  X     𝒫  Y      f_{\star}:\mathcal{P}(X)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(Y)   instead of    f  →     superscript  f  normal-→    f^{\rightarrow}          f  ⋆   :    𝒫   (  Y  )    →   𝒫   (  X  )        normal-:   superscript  f  normal-⋆    normal-→    𝒫  Y     𝒫  X      f^{\star}:\mathcal{P}(Y)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(X)   instead of    f  ←     superscript  f  normal-←    f^{\leftarrow}      Other terminology   An alternative notation for f [ A ] used in mathematical logic and set theory is f " A . 2  Some texts refer to the image of f as the range of f , but this usage should be avoided because the word "range" is also commonly used to mean the codomain of f .   Examples  1. f : {1,2,3} → { a,b,c,d } defined by    f   (  x  )   =   {      a  ,       if  x   =  1        a  ,       if  x   =  2        c  ,       if  x   =  3.          fragments  f   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)     fragments  normal-{    a      if  x   1     a      if  x   2     c      if  x   3.        f(x)=\left\{\begin{matrix}a,&\mbox{if }x=1\\
 a,&\mbox{if }x=2\\
 c,&\mbox{if }x=3.\end{matrix}\right.     The image of the set {2,3} under f is f ({2,3}) = { a,c }. The image of the function f is { a,c }. The preimage of a is f −1 ({ a }) = {1,2}. The preimage of { a,b } is also {1,2}. The preimage of { b , d } is the empty set {}.  2. f : R → R defined by f ( x ) = x 2 .  The image of {-2,3} under f is f ({-2,3}) = {4,9}, and the image of f is R + . The preimage of {4,9} under f is f −1 ({4,9}) = {-3,-2,2,3}. The preimage of set N = { n ∈ R | n 2 → R defined by f ( x , y ) = x 2 + y 2 .  The fibres  f −1 ({ a }) are concentric circles about the origin , the origin itself, and the empty set , depending on whether a >0, a =0, or a x ( M ) for x ∈ M . This is also an example of a fiber bundle .  5. A quotient group is a Homomorphic image  Consequences  Given a function f : X → Y , for all subsets A , A 1 , and A 2 of X and all subsets B , B 1 , and B 2 of Y we have:   f ( A 1 ∪ A 2 ) = f ( A 1 ) ∪ f ( A 2 ) 3  f ( A 1 ∩ A 2 ) ⊆ f ( A 1 ) ∩ f ( A 2 ) 4  f −1 ( B 1 ∪ B 2 ) = f −1 ( B 1 ) ∪ f −1 ( B 2 )  f −1 ( B 1 ∩ B 2 ) = f −1 ( B 1 ) ∩ f −1 ( B 2 )  f (A) ⊆ B ⇔ A ⊆ f −1 ( B )  f ( f −1 ( B )) ⊆ B 5  f −1 ( f ( A )) ⊇ A 6  A 1 ⊆ A 2 ⇒ f ( A 1 ) ⊆ f ( A 2 )  B 1 ⊆ B 2 ⇒ f −1 ( B 1 ) ⊆ f −1 ( B 2 )  f −1 ( B C ) = ( f −1 ( B )) C  ( f | A ) −1 ( B ) = A ∩ f −1 ( B ).   The results relating images and preimages to the ( Boolean ) algebra of intersection and union work for any collection of subsets, not just for pairs of subsets:        f   (    ⋃   s  ∈  S     A  s    )    =    ⋃   s  ∈  S     f   (   A  s   )           f    subscript     s  S     subscript  A  s       subscript     s  S      f   subscript  A  s       f\left(\bigcup_{s\in S}A_{s}\right)=\bigcup_{s\in S}f(A_{s})          f   (    ⋂   s  ∈  S     A  s    )    ⊆    ⋂   s  ∈  S     f   (   A  s   )           f    subscript     s  S     subscript  A  s       subscript     s  S      f   subscript  A  s       f\left(\bigcap_{s\in S}A_{s}\right)\subseteq\bigcap_{s\in S}f(A_{s})           f   -  1     (    ⋃   s  ∈  S     B  s    )    =    ⋃   s  ∈  S      f   -  1     (   B  s   )            superscript  f    1      subscript     s  S     subscript  B  s       subscript     s  S       superscript  f    1     subscript  B  s       f^{-1}\left(\bigcup_{s\in S}B_{s}\right)=\bigcup_{s\in S}f^{-1}(B_{s})           f   -  1     (    ⋂   s  ∈  S     B  s    )    =    ⋂   s  ∈  S      f   -  1     (   B  s   )            superscript  f    1      subscript     s  S     subscript  B  s       subscript     s  S       superscript  f    1     subscript  B  s       f^{-1}\left(\bigcap_{s\in S}B_{s}\right)=\bigcap_{s\in S}f^{-1}(B_{s})      (Here, S can be infinite, even uncountably infinite .)  With respect to the algebra of subsets, by the above we see that the inverse image function is a lattice homomorphism while the image function is only a semilattice homomorphism (it does not always preserve intersections).
