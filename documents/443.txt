   Alpha-amino-acid esterase      Alpha-amino-acid esterase   In enzymology , an alpha-amino-acid esterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an alpha-amino acid ester + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   an alpha-amino acid + an alcohol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are alpha-amino acid ester and H 2 O , whereas its two products are alpha-amino acid and alcohol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha-amino-acid-ester aminoacylhydrolase . This enzyme is also called alpha-amino acid ester hydrolase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
