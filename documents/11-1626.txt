   Triokinase      Triokinase   In enzymology , a triokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + D-glyceraldehyde   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and D-glyceraldehyde , whereas its two products are ADP and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphotransferase . This enzyme is also called triose kinase . This enzyme participates in fructose metabolism .
