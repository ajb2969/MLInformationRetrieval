   Artin–Rees lemma      Artin–Rees lemma   In mathematics , the Artin–Rees lemma is a basic result about modules over a Noetherian ring , along with results such as the Hilbert basis theorem . It was proved in the 1950s in independent works by the mathematicians  Emil Artin and David Rees ; a special case was known to Oscar Zariski prior to their work.  One consequence of the lemma is the Krull intersection theorem . The result is also used to prove the exactness property of completion .  Statement  Let I be an ideal in a Noetherian ring  R ; let M be a finitely generated R -module and let N a submodule of M . Then there exists an integer k ≥ 1 so that, for n ≥ k ,          I  n   M   ∩  N   =    I   n  -  k     (    (    I  k   M   )   ∩  N   )     .           superscript  I  n   M   N      superscript  I    n  k         superscript  I  k   M   N      I^{n}M\cap N=I^{n-k}((I^{k}M)\cap N).     Proof  The lemma immediately follows from the fact that R is "Noetherian" once necessary notions and notations are set up. 1  For any ring R and an ideal I in R , we set      B  I   R   =    ⊕   n  =  0   ∞    I  n           subscript  B  I   R     superscript   subscript  direct-sum    n  0       superscript  I  n      B_{I}R=\textstyle\bigoplus_{n=0}^{\infty}I^{n}   ( B for blow-up.) We say a decreasing sequence of submodules    M  =   M  0   ⊃   M  1   ⊃   M  2   ⊃  ⋯        M   subscript  M  0     superset-of     subscript  M  1     superset-of     subscript  M  2     superset-of    normal-⋯     M=M_{0}\supset M_{1}\supset M_{2}\supset\cdots   is an I -filtration if     I   M  n    ⊂   M   n  +  1          I   subscript  M  n     subscript  M    n  1      IM_{n}\subset M_{n+1}   ; moreover, it is stable if     I   M  n    =   M   n  +  1          I   subscript  M  n     subscript  M    n  1      IM_{n}=M_{n+1}   for sufficiently large n . If M is given an I -filtration, we set      B  I   M   =    ⊕   n  =  0   ∞    M  n           subscript  B  I   M     superscript   subscript  direct-sum    n  0       subscript  M  n      B_{I}M=\textstyle\bigoplus_{n=0}^{\infty}M_{n}   ; it is a graded module over     B  I   R       subscript  B  I   R    B_{I}R   .  Now, let M be a R -module with the I -filtration    M  i     subscript  M  i    M_{i}   by finitely generated R -modules. We make an observation       B  I   M       subscript  B  I   M    B_{I}M   is a finitely generated module over     B  I   R       subscript  B  I   R    B_{I}R   if and only if the filtration is I -stable. Indeed, if the filtration is I -stable, then     B  I   M       subscript  B  I   M    B_{I}M   is generated by the first    k  +  1      k  1    k+1   terms     M  0   ,  …  ,   M  k       subscript  M  0   normal-…   subscript  M  k     M_{0},\dots,M_{k}   and those terms are finitely generated; thus,     B  I   M       subscript  B  I   M    B_{I}M   is finitely generated. Conversely, if it is finitely generated, say, by     ⊕   j  =  0   k    M  j       superscript   subscript  direct-sum    j  0    k    subscript  M  j     \textstyle\bigoplus_{j=0}^{k}M_{j}   , then, for    n  ≥  k      n  k    n\geq k   , each f in    M  n     subscript  M  n    M_{n}   can be written as       f  =   ∑    a   i  j     g   i  j       ,    a   i  j    ∈   I   n  -  j        formulae-sequence    f       subscript  a    i  j     subscript  g    i  j          subscript  a    i  j     superscript  I    n  j       f=\sum a_{ij}g_{ij},\quad a_{ij}\in I^{n-j}   with the generators    g   i  j      subscript  g    i  j     g_{ij}   in      M  j   ,  j   ≤  k        subscript  M  j   j   k    M_{j},j\leq k   . That is,    f  ∈    I   n  -  k     M  k        f     superscript  I    n  k     subscript  M  k      f\in I^{n-k}M_{k}   .  We can now prove the lemma, assuming R is Noetherian. Let     M  n   =    I  n   M        subscript  M  n      superscript  I  n   M     M_{n}=I^{n}M   . Then    M  n     subscript  M  n    M_{n}   are an I -stable filtration. Thus, by the observation,     B  I   M       subscript  B  I   M    B_{I}M   is finitely generated over     B  I   R       subscript  B  I   R    B_{I}R   . But      B  I   R   ≃   R   [   I  t   ]       similar-to-or-equals     subscript  B  I   R     R   delimited-[]    I  t       B_{I}R\simeq R[It]   is a Noetherian ring since R is. (The ring    R   [   I  t   ]       R   delimited-[]    I  t      R[It]   is called the Rees algebra .) Thus,     B  I   M       subscript  B  I   M    B_{I}M   is a Noetherian module and any submodule is finitely generated over     B  I   R       subscript  B  I   R    B_{I}R   ; in particular,     B  I   N       subscript  B  I   N    B_{I}N   is finitely generated when N is given the induced filtration; i.e.,     N  n   =    M  n   ∩  N        subscript  N  n      subscript  M  n   N     N_{n}=M_{n}\cap N   . Then the induced filtration is I -stable again by the observation.  Proof of Krull's intersection theorem  Besides the use in completion of a ring, a typical application of the lemma is the proof of the Krull's intersection theorem, which says       ⋂   n  =  1   ∞     I  n    =  0        superscript   subscript     n  1       superscript  I  n    0    \textstyle\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}I^{n}=0   for a proper ideal I in a Noetherian local ring. By the lemma applied to the intersection N , we find k such that for    n  ≥  k      n  k    n\geq k   ,           I  n   ∩  N   =    I   n  -  k     (    I  k   ∩  N   )     .         superscript  I  n   N      superscript  I    n  k       superscript  I  k   N      I^{n}\cap N=I^{n-k}(I^{k}\cap N).        But then    N  =   I  N       N    I  N     N=IN   and thus    N  =  0      N  0    N=0   by Nakayama .
