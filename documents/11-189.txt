   Cyanide hydratase      Cyanide hydratase   In enzymology , a cyanide hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   formamide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cyanide + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , formamide , and two products , cyanide and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is formamide hydro-lyase (cyanide-forming) . Other names in common use include formamide dehydratase , and formamide hydro-lyase . This enzyme participates in cyanoamino acid metabolism .
