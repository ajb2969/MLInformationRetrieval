   Positive current      Positive current   In mathematics, more particularly in complex geometry , algebraic geometry and complex analysis , a positive current is a positive ( n-p , n-p )-form over an n -dimensional complex manifold , taking values in distributions.  For a formal definition, consider a manifold M . Currents on M are (by definition) differential forms with coefficients in distributions. ; integrating over M , we may consider currents as "currents of integration", that is, functionals      η  ↦     ∫  M   η   ∧  ρ      maps-to  η      subscript   M   η   ρ     \eta\mapsto\int_{M}\eta\wedge\rho     on smooth forms with compact support. This way, currents are considered as elements in the dual space to the space     Λ  c  *    (  M  )        superscript   subscript  normal-Λ  c     M    \Lambda_{c}^{*}(M)   of forms with compact support.  Now, let M be a complex manifold. The Hodge decomposition       Λ  i    (  M  )    =    ⊕    p  +  q   =  i      Λ   p  ,  q     (  M  )            superscript  normal-Λ  i   M     subscript  direct-sum      p  q   i       superscript  normal-Λ   p  q    M      \Lambda^{i}(M)=\bigoplus_{p+q=i}\Lambda^{p,q}(M)   is defined on currents, in a natural way, the (p,q) -currents being functionals on     Λ  c   p  ,  q     (  M  )        superscript   subscript  normal-Λ  c    p  q    M    \Lambda_{c}^{p,q}(M)   .  A positive current is defined as a real current of Hodge type (p,p) , taking non-negative values on all positive  (p,p) -forms.  Characterization of Kähler manifolds  Using the Hahn–Banach theorem , Harvey and Lawson proved the following criterion of existence of Kähler metrics . 1  Theorem: Let M be a compact complex manifold. Then M does not admit a Kähler structure if and only if M admits a non-zero positive (1,1)-current   Θ   normal-Θ   \Theta   which is a (1,1)-part of an exact 2-current.  Note that the de Rham differential maps 3-currents to 2-currents, hence   Θ   normal-Θ   \Theta   is a differential of a 3-current; if   Θ   normal-Θ   \Theta   is a current of integration of a complex curve , this means that this curve is a (1,1)-part of a boundary.  When M admits a surjective map    π  :   M  ↦  X      normal-:  π   maps-to  M  X     \pi:\;M\mapsto X   to a Kähler manifold with 1-dimensional fibers, this theorem leads to the following result of complex algebraic geometry.  Corollary: In this situation, M is non- Kähler if and only if the homology class of a generic fiber of   π   π   \pi   is a (1,1)-part of a boundary.
