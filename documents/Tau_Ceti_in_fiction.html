<p>The <a href="planetary_system" title="wikilink">planetary systems</a> of <a href="star" title="wikilink">stars</a> other than the <a class="uri" href="Sun" title="wikilink">Sun</a> and the <a href="Solar_System" title="wikilink">Solar System</a> are a staple element in much <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a>. <a href="Tau_Ceti" title="wikilink">Tau Ceti</a> is the second closest star to the Sun (after <a href="Alpha_Centauri_in_fiction" title="wikilink">Alpha Centauri A</a>) having <a href="Stellar_classification#Class_G" title="wikilink">spectral class G</a>, making it a popular story setting or system of origin in science fiction tales. The Sun, itself of spectral class G, provides an obvious model for the possibility that the star might harbor worlds capable of supporting life. But Tau Ceti, weighing in at ~0.78 M<sub>☉</sub>, is metal-poor<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and so is thought to be unlikely to host rocky planets (see <em><a href="#Literature" title="wikilink">Destination: Void</a></em> by Frank Herbert below); on the other hand, observations have detected more than ten times as much dust around the star than exists in the Solar System,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> a condition tending to enhance the probability of such bodies. Since the star's luminosity is barely 55% that of the <a class="uri" href="Sun" title="wikilink">Sun</a>, those planets would need to circle it at the orbital radius of <a class="uri" href="Venus" title="wikilink">Venus</a> in order to match the <a class="uri" href="insolation" title="wikilink">insolation</a> received by the Earth.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> (See <em><a href="#Literature" title="wikilink">Time for the Stars</a></em> by Robert Heinlein below.)</p>

<p>Tau is the 19th letter of the Greek alphabet. The name Cetus is also Greek (Κῆτος, <em>Kētos</em>) as well as Arabic (ألقيتوس, <em>al Ḳaiṭos</em>) and translates variously as a large fish, a whale, a shark, or a sea monster.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In Greek mythology, the cetacean constellation, although not the star itself, represents the monster slain by Perseus in his rescue of the beautiful <a href="Cetus_(mythology)#Mythology" title="wikilink">princess Andromeda</a>.</p>
<h2 id="general-uses-of-tau-ceti">General uses of Tau Ceti</h2>

<p>Many stars may be referred to in fictional works for their <a href="metaphor" title="wikilink">metaphorical</a> or <a href="mythology" title="wikilink">mythological</a> associations, or else as bright points of light in the <a href="night_sky" title="wikilink">sky of Earth</a>, but not as locations in space or the centers of planetary systems.</p>

<p>The constellation Cetus lies close to the celestial equator and intersects the plane of the ecliptic, which allows it to be seen from most of the Earth's surface. However, because of its unprepossessing appearance in the sky, and its want of a "good" traditional name to supplement its esoteric Bayer designation, Tau Ceti has rarely if ever been used in a general sense, either in traditional mythologies or in the arts and literature that draw sustenance from them.</p>

<p>The star's popularity as a subject of science fiction stems not from its general cultural resonance, but from its <a href="Tau_Ceti" title="wikilink">astronomical data</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>proximity, ~11.9 light-years distant</li>
<li>similarity to the Sun, ~0.78 M<sub>☉</sub>, spectral type G</li>
<li>a short but technical sounding name, in this context a benefit rather than a detriment</li>
<li>capacity to host a family of earth-like planets (proven in 2012)</li>

The kicker is, <em>Tau Ceti has no planets.</em> It's all part of the experiment...

The story revolves around the protagonist, Comet Jo, and a narrator-creature named Jewel. It is a tale of Comet Jo’s coming-of-age, his initiation into the ways of galactic society, his efforts to deliver an unspecified but important message to the <em>Empire Star</em>, and his encounter with a movement to bring an end to slavery. As the narrative opens, we meet Comet Jo at eighteen years of age. He has spent his entire life in a <em>simplex</em> society on <strong>Rhys</strong>, a satellite of the <a href="Gas_giant" title="wikilink">Jovian</a> planet <strong>Tyre</strong> orbiting Tau Ceti: "Crimson Ceti bruised the western crags; Tyre, giant as solar Jupiter, was a black curve against a quarter of the sky..."<mtpl></mtpl><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The first insight of Jo's developing maturity is his realization that the "simplex" culture of his home is actually quite "<a href="Simplicial_complex" title="wikilink">complex</a>"...</li>

The colony world <strong>Plateau</strong> in the Tau Ceti system lives by a rigorous code: All crimes are punishable by involuntary organ harvesting, while organ transplants are reserved to the benefit of the aristocracy. A robotic <strong><a href="Bussard_ramjet" title="wikilink">Bussard ramjet</a></strong> (see graphic) arrives from Earth, bearing a gift that will upset the unstable social balance on Plateau.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The relative proximity of Tau Ceti to the Earth (with a turnaround point at <a href="Luyten_726-8" title="wikilink">UV Ceti</a>) is an important plot element in the novel, enabling Plateau to be isolated from the mother planet, and yet still close enough to receive occasional cargoes via ramjet. The exploitation of the interstellar ramjet is just one of Larry Niven's many technical coups; as his career blossomed he was seen by many as the last best hope of hard science fiction with his inventiveness, his belief in the ultimately beneficial effects of technology, and his cognitive exuberance.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></li>

Urras has two major nation-states named A-Io (a cold-war analog of the United States) and Thu (a Soviet analog); the two rivals are fighting a proxy war in a third state, Benbili. Anarchical Anarres has been settled by exiles from Urras; it is the home of the physicist Shevek, who in a conceptual breakthrough (a common Le Guin theme)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> develops the mathematics behind the <em>ansible</em>, a device enabling instantaneous communication throughout the galaxy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></li>

This is the story of a group of astronomers who are approaching Earth after a 200-year journey from their colony world <strong>Filia</strong> (Latin for <em>daughter</em>) in the Tau Ceti system.

The <em>Hisa</em> are Downbelow's native inhabitants. Also called Downers by humans, they are gentle and friendly primate-like bipeds covered in brown fur with large eyes, possessing only the most rudimentary technology. Pell is the terminus of the "Great Circle" chain of space stations that links stars in the galactic vicinity of the Earth. As Cherryh states in her 2001 introduction to the novel, "...

Travel between star systems in the Vorkosigan universe is accomplished via <strong><a class="uri" href="wormholes" title="wikilink">wormholes</a></strong> (see graphic), spatial anomalies that allow instantaneous “jumps” between widely separated locations by means of five-dimensional space folding.

<ul>
<li><em><a href="Star_Trek_II:_The_Wrath_of_Khan" title="wikilink">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a></em> (1982), film written by <a href="Jack_B._Sowards" title="wikilink">Jack B. Sowards</a> and directed by <a href="Nicholas_Meyer" title="wikilink">Nicholas Meyer</a>. The film opens with a space battle between the <em>USS Enterprise</em> and a Klingon ship that turns out to be a simulation: the <a href="Kobayashi_Maru" title="wikilink">Kobayashi Maru</a> test for cadets pursuing the command track at Starfleet Academy. This simulation confronts the subject with a moral and strategic dilemma. Should she rescue the disabled civilian vessel <em>Kobayashi Maru</em> if it means violating a peace treaty with the Klingons and the risk of war, or should he observe the spatial proscriptions of the treaty and abandon the ship to certain extinction? The city Amber on <strong>Tau Ceti IV</strong> is the homeport of the 3rd class neutronic fuel carrier <em>Kobayashi Maru</em>, and her master Kojiro Vance.</li>
<li>"<a href="Where_No_One_Has_Gone_Before" title="wikilink">Where No One Has Gone Before</a>" (1987), episode of <em><a href="Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation" title="wikilink">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> written by <a href="Diane_Duane" title="wikilink">Diane Duane</a> and <a href="Michael_Reaves" title="wikilink">Michael Reaves</a>, and directed by <a href="Rob_Bowman_(filmmaker)" title="wikilink">Rob Bowman</a>. The <em>Traveler</em>, a native of the planet <strong>Tau Alpha C</strong> in the Tau Ceti system, visits the USS <em>Enterprise</em>-D in 2364. The mysterious humanoid possesses the ability to alter time and space with his thoughts, due to his mastery of the concept that "matter, energy, and thought" are related and interchangeable. As a sociological assessment of the maturity of the ship's crew, the Traveler arranges for the <em>Enterprise</em> to approach the Outer Rim, one of the oldest parts of the universe—and a place where human beings are assaulted by all sorts of hallucinations and fantasies.</li>
<li>"<a href="Conspiracy_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)" title="wikilink">Conspiracy</a>" (1988), episode of <em><a href="Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation" title="wikilink">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> written by <a href="Tracy_Tormé" title="wikilink">Tracy Tormé</a> and directed by <a href="Cliff_Bole" title="wikilink">Cliff Bole</a>. Captain Walker Keel of the USS <em>Horatio</em> secretly contacts Captain Picard to request a face-to-face meeting. Keel is an old friend—the two first met years ago at "quite an exotic" bar on <strong>Tau Ceti III</strong>—and Picard is quick to accept. At the meeting, Keel warns Picard and several other captains to be wary of directives from the possibly compromised <a href="Starfleet" title="wikilink">Starfleet Headquarters</a>, advice reinforced when the USS <em>Enterprise</em> soon afterwards comes upon the wreckage of the sabotaged <em>Horatio</em>. Keel's suspicions are borne out as it becomes clear that certain senior admirals are controlled by invading alien parasites.</li>
<li>"<a href="Shadows_of_P'Jem" title="wikilink">Shadows of P'Jem</a>" (2002), episode of <em><a href="Star_Trek:_Enterprise" title="wikilink">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> , written by <a href="Rick_Berman" title="wikilink">Rick Berman</a> &amp; <a href="Brannon_Braga" title="wikilink">Brannon Braga</a> (story) and <a href="Mike_Sussman_(TV_series_writer/producer)" title="wikilink">Mike Sussman</a> &amp; <a href="Phyllis_Strong" title="wikilink">Phyllis Strong</a> and directed by <a href="Mike_Vejar" title="wikilink">Mike Vejar</a>. The episode makes reference to the <strong>Tau Ceti Accords</strong>, a treaty signed between the <a href="Vulcan_(Star_Trek)" title="wikilink">Vulcans</a> and <a href="Andorian" title="wikilink">Andorians</a> sometime prior to 2151. It included a clause forbidding Andorian military on the Vulcan-allied planet of Coridan. The Andorians were found to have been violating this aspect of the treaty in the episode, though the Andorians found the accusation hypocritical, as the Vulcan had been found in the earlier episode "<a href="The_Andorian_Incident" title="wikilink">The Andorian Incident</a>" to have been spying on the Andorians, using a listening station concealed beneath the ancient P'Jem monastery, which itself was in violation of a treaty.</li>

<ul>
<li><em><a href="Barbarella_(film)" title="wikilink">Barbarella</a></em> (1968), film written by Vittorio Bonicelli <em>et al</em> and directed by <a href="Roger_Vadim" title="wikilink">Roger Vadim</a> based on Jean-Claude Forest's French <a href="Barbarella_(comics)" title="wikilink">Barbarella</a> comics. Barbarella is assigned by the President of Earth to retrieve Dr. Durand Durand—inventor of the Positronic Ray—from the planet <strong>Tau Ceti</strong> that he might use it to help save the Earth. The mission starts badly as she crashes on an icy plain of her destination world. After a lengthy and complicated sequence of concussions, captures, rescues, grateful copulations, wardrobe malfunctions, and repeated changes into ever scantier costumes, culminating in a confrontation with the Tyrant of the decadent city of Sogo, Barbarella discovers Durand Durand—who has other ideas than returning to Earth with her, starting with the <strong>Excessive Machine</strong> (see graphic). The alien world of Tau Ceti is distinguished by a real, if intermittent sense of wonder created by the sheer otherworldliness of the production design and art direction.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></li>
<li><em><a href="Terror_of_the_Zygons" title="wikilink">Terror of the Zygons</a></em> (1975), serial written by <a href="Robert_Banks_Stewart" title="wikilink">Robert Banks Stewart</a> for the television series <em><a href="Doctor_Who" title="wikilink">Doctor Who</a></em>. The Doctor and Sarah become involved in a plot by the Zygons, led by their warlord Broton, to take over the Earth, using the Loch Ness Monster—an armoured cyborg of great power—as a cat's-paw, and using their shape-shifting ability to infiltrate human defenses. The Zygons are in need of a new planet because their homeworld Zygor was destroyed in an attack by the Xaranti, an arachnid race from Tau Ceti.</li>
<li><em><a href="The_Stones_of_Blood" title="wikilink">The Stones of Blood</a></em> (1978), serial written by <a href="David_Fisher_(writer)" title="wikilink">David Fisher</a> for the television series <em><a href="Doctor_Who" title="wikilink">Doctor Who</a></em>. The Doctor and Romana are about to embark in search of the third segment of the <em>Key to Time</em> when they abruptly find themselves face to face with the <em>Nine Travelers</em>, a group of standing stones on Boscombe Moor in Cornwall. It turns out that the stones, nourished by sacrifices of human blood, are disguised Ogri, an alien life form from the planet <strong>Ogros</strong> in the Tau Ceti system. Struggles follow, and there is danger, but in the end the surviving Ogri are forcibly repatriated, another segment of the <em>Key</em> is recovered, and all is well.</li>
<li><em><a href="The_Powers_of_Matthew_Star" title="wikilink">The Powers of Matthew Star</a></em> (1982–1983), television series written by David Carren <em>et al</em> and directed by <a href="Barry_Crane" title="wikilink">Barry Crane</a> <em>et al</em>. An intergalactic armada conquers <strong>Quadris</strong>, a planet of the Tau Ceti system. Crown prince E'Hawke escapes with his guardian and factotum D'Hai to the nearby Earth, where they assume the cover identities of Walter Shepherd and Matthew Star. Star is a typical American teenager (albeit with special powers). He has friends; people who love him. He has adolescent male fans who find in him a vehicle for vicarious wish-fulfillment.</li>
<li><em><a href="Earth:_Final_Conflict" title="wikilink">Earth: Final Conflict</a></em> (1997–2002), Canadian television series created by <a href="Gene_Roddenberry" title="wikilink">Gene Roddenberry</a> and directed by <a href="David_Winning" title="wikilink">David Winning</a>. The alien Taelons are somewhat dubiously welcomed to a refuge on the Earth, where their advanced technology ushers in a golden age. It turns out, however that this race is sterile and dying, and at the same time intent on bioengineering humanity—at the cost of human self-determination—to serve as proxy warriors in a final confrontation with their millennial hereditary enemies, the Jaridians of Tau Ceti.</li>

<h2 id="comics">Comics</h2>

<p>Most of the items in this section are manga or light novels by Japanese authors.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a class="uri" href="Skizz" title="wikilink">Skizz</a></em> (1983–1995), comic books by <a href="Alan_Moore" title="wikilink">Alan Moore</a> published by <a href="2000_AD_(comics)" title="wikilink">2000 AD</a> Comics. Zhcchz, an alien interpreter and a native of Tau Ceti, crash lands on Earth and his ship self-destructs in an attempt to prevent his unauthorized contact with the primitive Earthlings—an event that turns his sedate, unexciting life into a nightmare.

<li><em><a href="2001_Nights" title="wikilink">2001 Nights</a></em> (1984–1986), manga by <a href="Yukinobu_Hoshino" title="wikilink">Yukinobu Hoshino</a>. <em>2001 Nights</em> is largely inspired by classic hard science fiction, with many visual homages to previous science fiction novels and films. The tale of Night 4, "Posterity" (1985), tells of an interstellar seedship that voyages from the Earth to the planet <strong>Ozma</strong> in the Tau Ceti system carrying a cargo of embryos that will form the nucleus of a new human colony.</li>
<li><em><a href="Sailor_Moon" title="wikilink">Sailor Moon</a></em> (1992), manga by <a href="Naoko_Takeuchi" title="wikilink">Naoko Takeuchi</a>. The <a href="Death_Busters" title="wikilink">Death Busters</a> are a group of antagonists in the Sailor Moon metaseries.

Pharaoh 90 is a malevolent monster from the Tau Ceti system, appearing as a huge, black eyeball-like sphere with tentacles.</li>
<li><em><a href="Bodacious_Space_Pirates" title="wikilink">Bodacious Space Pirates</a></em> (2008- ), <a href="light_novel" title="wikilink">light novel</a> series written by <a href="Yūichi_Sasamoto" title="wikilink">Yūichi Sasamoto</a>.

<li><em><a href="Task_Force_Games" title="wikilink">Cerberus: The Proxima Centauri Campaign</a></em> (1979), strategy board game designed by <a href="Stephen_V._Cole" title="wikilink">Stephen V. Cole</a> and published by <a href="Task_Force_Games" title="wikilink">Task Force Games</a>. Humanity tries to colonize a world in the Proxima Centauri system that is already inhabited by aliens from Tau Ceti. The game revolves around ground combat between the rival races. Note that Proxima Centauri, at 4.24 light-years from Earth, is about 13.37 ly from Tau-Ceti, giving us the claim of proximity while leaving the right of prior possession to the Cetians.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></li>
<li><em><a class="uri" href="BattleTech" title="wikilink">BattleTech</a></em> (1984), wargame and related products launched by <a href="FASA" title="wikilink">The FASA Corporation</a>. Tau Ceti is the first star outside our Solar System to be explored by human beings, first by an automated interstellar <strong><a href="Magellan_(spacecraft)" title="wikilink">Magellan probe</a></strong> (see graphic), and later by men who fare forth in the JumpShip TAS <em>Pathfinder</em>, the latter vessel being powered by a superluminal Kearny-Fuchida drive. The pioneers discover a watery earthlike world in orbit around the star, attended by a single moon (Lanna); the planet will be colonized and named <strong>New Earth</strong>.</li>

The year is 2164. A robot rebellion has sealed off <strong>Tau Ceti III</strong>, and previous attempts at retaking the planet have ended in failure. The last best chance of restoring human control is to send in a single pilot (the player) in a small ship, with the mission of infiltrating the capital city Centralis and shutting down the central reactor—the power source on which the robots depend.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></li>
<li><em><a href="2300_AD" title="wikilink">2300 AD</a></em> (1986), role-playing game published by the <a href="Game_Designers'_Workshop" title="wikilink">Game Designers' Workshop</a>. <strong>Kwantung</strong> (<strong>Tau Ceti II</strong>) is a temperate garden-like world harboring the Manchurian colony <em>Changpai</em> and the Mexican colony <em>Nuevo Angeles</em>.

<li><em><a href="Battlelords_of_the_23rd_Century" title="wikilink">Battlelords of the 23rd Century</a></em> (1990), paper and pencil role-playing game designed by Lawrence R. Sims and published by <a href="Optimus_Design_Systems" title="wikilink">Optimus Design Systems</a>. The Galactic Alliance, spanning several galaxies, comprises twelve races (including Humans), and is run behind the scenes by large corporations that hire battlelords (the game players) to further their ends by all means legal and illegal. One of the Alliance races are the Phentari, haughty and treacherous, schizophrenic cephalopod warriors. They are methane-breathers from the cold marsh-gas world <strong>Phena</strong> in the Tau Ceti system.</li>
<li><em><a href="Frontier:_Elite_II" title="wikilink">Frontier: Elite II</a></em> (1993), <em><a href="Frontier:_First_Encounters" title="wikilink">Frontier: First Encounters</a></em> (1995) and <em><a href="Elite:_Dangerous" title="wikilink">Elite: Dangerous</a></em> (2014), computer games written by <a href="David_Braben" title="wikilink">David Braben</a> <em>et al</em>. Tau Ceti is orbited by the densely populated earthlike world known as <strong>Taylor Colony</strong>, a member of the Federation. This planet was the first permanent human settlement outside Solar System, and the first extraterrestrial planet known to support life. Tau Ceti also contains an asteroid belt close to the star, a rocky, Mercury-like world called Saunders' Claim, a metal-rich world known as Bell's Wreck, and an icy, Enceladus-like world known as Tau Ceti 4.</li>
<li><em><a href="Marathon_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Marathon</a></em> (1994), first-person shooter video game developed and published by <a class="uri" href="Bungie" title="wikilink">Bungie</a>.

<li><em><a href="Escape_Velocity_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Escape Velocity</a></em> (1996), <em><a href="Escape_Velocity_Override" title="wikilink">Escape Velocity Override</a></em> (1998), and <em><a href="Escape_Velocity_Nova" title="wikilink">Escape Velocity Nova</a></em> (2002), computer games developed and published by <a href="Ambrosia_Software" title="wikilink">Ambrosia Software</a>. The plot of the original <em>Escape Velocity</em> revolves around war between the Confederation government and the Rebellion against it. The game player may choose sides based on a wide variety of criteria. One of the major participants in the conflict is the Tau Ceti system, due in large part to its proximity to hyperlinks and, in the third game, wormholes. Tau Ceti remains an important center in all three games, although their plots are unrelated.</li>
<li><em><a href="Sid_Meier's_Alpha_Centauri" title="wikilink">Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri</a></em> (1999), video strategy game developed by <a href="Firaxis_Games" title="wikilink">Firaxis Games</a> and published by <a href="Electronic_Arts" title="wikilink">Electronic Arts</a>. Inspired by Meier's earlier success <em>Civilization</em>, and set in the 22nd century, this game begins when seven competing ideological factions land on the planet Chiron in the Alpha Centauri star system. The <em>Tau Ceti flowering</em>, in which an experiment in planet-level sentience accidentally destroyed all animal life in the Tau Ceti system, serves as the primary argument used by the alien Progenitor <a href="Sid_Meier's_Alien_Crossfire#Setting" title="wikilink">Manifold Caretakers</a> faction against launching further flowerings in other systems—such as Alpha Centauri itself.</li>
<li><em><a href="System_Shock_2" title="wikilink">System Shock 2</a></em> (1999), first person action video game designed by <a href="Ken_Levine_(game_developer)" title="wikilink">Ken Levine</a> and published by <a href="Electronic_Arts" title="wikilink">Electronic Arts</a>.

The player must destroy and cleanse from the ships those crew members who are in thrall to the <em>Many</em>, and then confront and defeat SHODAN in cyberspace.</li>

<li><em><a href="Earth_&amp;_Beyond" title="wikilink">Earth &amp; Beyond</a></em> (2002), online role-playing game published by <a href="Electronic_Arts" title="wikilink">Electronic Arts</a>. Three cohorts of humanity: the acquisitive, mercantile <em>Terrans</em>; the perfectionist, genetically-engineered <em>Progen</em>; and the philosophical <em>Jenquai</em> dwell together in the Solar System in uneasy equilibrium. The balance is shattered by the discovery of a StarGate, an artifact left by an ancient civilization. There follow war, stalemate, peace, rapid settlement of the galactic neighborhood, and domination of commerce by Terran cartels. One of the first human colonies established, and the terminus of the vast <em>Somerled Trade Run</em>, is the Terran outpost on Tau Ceti.</li>
<li><em><a href="EVE_Online" title="wikilink">EVE Online</a></em> (2003), <a href="Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game" title="wikilink">MMORPG</a> developed and published by <a href="CCP_Games" title="wikilink">CCP Games</a>. The wormhole connecting mankind's second galaxy, New Eden, to the Milky Way collapses and leaves all its colonies stranded. After a dark interregnum, and some thousands of years, five spacefaring cultures arise there: the Amarr Empire, the Caldari State, the Gallente Federation, the Minmatar Republic and the Jove Directorate. Game play is concerned with the wars, rivalries, and alliances between these factions (see graphic). Although memories of the home galaxy have receded into the mists of time, it is known that the Gallente homeworld was originally settled by descendants of the French colonists of Tau Ceti.</li>

One of the targets of this endeavour was Maia. Maia, sitting a mere twelve light years away in the Tau Ceti system, was a world in flux. The colonization process had commenced almost twenty years earlier. Barrages of satellites equipped with powerful solid state lasers were placed in geosynchronous orbit around the planet. Their mission to slow and deflect major meteoric threats. The dense volcanic atmosphere was then seeded with sulfur, in an effort to calm and cool it. After a brief fourteen years of orbital terraforming, earth's political elites deemed the planet safe for human settlement, despite little being known about the surface.</li>
<li><em>Lifeline</em> (2015), a gamebook/choose-your-own-adventure novel that tries to do something a bit different from other games: it is designed as a game where you experience it through notifications as much as you do through the app itself, with simple A/B choices to make. It's got Apple Watch compatibility, so it's meant to be something that you can experience anywhere, at any time. It also plays off of the ways that we receive notifications on our devices, and wait for responses. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></li>
