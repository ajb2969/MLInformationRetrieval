   Gluon condensate      Gluon condensate   In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the gluon condensate is a non-perturbative property of the QCD vacuum which could be partly responsible for giving masses to certain hadrons.  If the gluon field tensor is represented as G μν , then the gluon condensate is the vacuum expectation value     ⟨    G   μ  ν     G   μ  ν     ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩     subscript  G    μ  ν     superscript  G    μ  ν       \langle G_{\mu\nu}G^{\mu\nu}\rangle   . It is not clear yet whether this condensate is related to any of the known phase changes in quark matter . There have been scattered studies of other types of gluon condensates, involving a different number of gluon fields.  For more on the context in which this quantity occurs, see the article on the QCD vacuum .
