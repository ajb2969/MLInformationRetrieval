Closing (morphology)




Closing (morphology)

 In mathematical morphology, the '''closing ''' of a set (binary image) A by a structuring element B is the erosion of the dilation of that set,



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denote the dilation and erosion, respectively.
In image processing, closing is, together with opening, the basic workhorse of morphological noise removal. Opening removes small objects, while closing removes small holes.
Properties

It is idempotent, that is, 
 
 
 
 .
It is increasing, that is, if 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .
It is extensive, i.e., 
 
 
 
 .
It is translation invariant.
