   Closing (morphology)      Closing (morphology)   In mathematical morphology , the '''closing ''' of a set ( binary image ) A by a structuring element  B is the erosion of the dilation of that set,        A  ∙  B   =    (   A  ⊕  B   )   ⊖  B    ,       normal-∙  A  B    symmetric-difference   direct-sum  A  B   B     A\bullet B=(A\oplus B)\ominus B,\,     where   ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus   and   ⊖   symmetric-difference   \ominus   denote the dilation and erosion, respectively.  In image processing , closing is, together with opening , the basic workhorse of morphological noise removal. Opening removes small objects, while closing removes small holes.  Properties   It is idempotent , that is,      (   A  ∙  B   )   ∙  B   =   A  ∙  B        normal-∙   normal-∙  A  B   B    normal-∙  A  B     (A\bullet B)\bullet B=A\bullet B   .  It is increasing , that is, if    A  ⊆  C      A  C    A\subseteq C   , then     A  ∙  B   ⊆   C  ∙  B        normal-∙  A  B    normal-∙  C  B     A\bullet B\subseteq C\bullet B   .  It is extensive , i.e.,    A  ⊆   A  ∙  B       A   normal-∙  A  B     A\subseteq A\bullet B   .  It is translation invariant .
