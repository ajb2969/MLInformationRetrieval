   Pauli equation      Pauli equation   In quantum mechanics , the Pauli equation or Schrödinger–Pauli equation is the formulation of the Schrödinger equation for spin-½ particles, which takes into account the interaction of the particle's spin with an external electromagnetic field . It is the non- relativistic limit of the Dirac equation and can be used where particles are moving at speeds much less than the speed of light , so that relativistic effects can be neglected. It was formulated by Wolfgang Pauli in 1927. 1  Equation  For a particle of mass m and charge q , in an electromagnetic field described by the vector potential  A = ( A x , A y , A z ) and scalar  electric potential  ϕ , the Pauli equation reads:  where σ = ( σ x , σ y , σ z ) are the Pauli matrices collected into a vector for convenience, p = − iħ ∇ is the momentum operator wherein ∇ denotes the gradient operator , and       |  ψ  ⟩   =   (      ψ  +        ψ  -      )        ket  ψ      subscript  ψ       subscript  ψ        |\psi\rangle=\begin{pmatrix}\psi_{+}\\
 \psi_{-}\end{pmatrix}     is the two-component spinor  wavefunction , a column vector written in Dirac notation .  The Hamiltonian operator       H  ^   =     1   2  m      (   𝝈  ⋅   (   𝐩  -   q  𝐀    )    )   2    +   q  ϕ         normal-^  H         1    2  m     superscript   normal-⋅  𝝈    𝐩    q  𝐀     2      q  ϕ      \hat{H}=\frac{1}{2m}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot(\mathbf{p}-q\mathbf{A}))^{2}+q\phi     is a 2 × 2 matrix operator, because of the Pauli matrices. Substitution into the Schrödinger equation gives the Pauli equation. This Hamiltonian is similar to the classical Hamiltonian for a charged particle interacting with an electromagnetic field, see Lorentz force for details of this classical case. The kinetic energy term for a free particle in the absence of an electromagnetic field is just p 2 /2 m where p is the kinetic momentum , while in the presence of an EM field we have the minimal coupling  p = P − q A , where P is the canonical momentum .  The Pauli matrices can be removed from the kinetic energy term, using the Pauli vector identity :        (   𝝈  ⋅  𝐚   )    (   𝝈  ⋅  𝐛   )    =    𝐚  ⋅  𝐛   +    i  𝝈   ⋅   (   𝐚  ×  𝐛   )            normal-⋅  𝝈  𝐚    normal-⋅  𝝈  𝐛       normal-⋅  𝐚  𝐛    normal-⋅    i  𝝈     𝐚  𝐛       (\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\mathbf{a})(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\mathbf{b})=%
 \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}+i\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\left(\mathbf{a}\times%
 \mathbf{b}\right)     to obtain 2  where B = ∇ × A is the magnetic field .  Relationship with the Schrödinger equation and the Dirac equation  The Pauli equation is non-relativistic, but it does predict spin. As such, it can be thought of as occupying the middle ground between:   The familiar Schrödinger equation (on a complex scalar wavefunction ), which is non-relativistic and does not predict spin.  The Dirac equation (on a complex four-component spinor ), which is fully relativistic (with respect to special relativity ) and predicts spin.   Note that because of the properties of the Pauli matrices, if the magnetic vector potential A is equal to zero, then the equation reduces to the familiar Schrödinger equation for a particle in a purely electric potential ϕ , except that it operates on a two-component spinor :         [     𝐩  2    2  m    +   q  ϕ    ]    (      ψ  +        ψ  -      )    =   i  ℏ   ∂   ∂  t     (      ψ  +        ψ  -      )     .         delimited-[]       superscript  𝐩  2     2  m      q  ϕ        subscript  ψ       subscript  ψ         i  Planck-constant-over-2-pi       t       subscript  ψ       subscript  ψ         \left[\frac{\mathbf{p}^{2}}{2m}+q\phi\right]\begin{pmatrix}\psi_{+}\\
 \psi_{-}\end{pmatrix}=i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\begin{pmatrix}\psi_{+}%
 \\
 \psi_{-}\end{pmatrix}.     Therefore, we can see that the spin of the particle only affects its motion in the presence of a magnetic field.  Relationship with Stern–Gerlach experiment  Both spinor components satisfy the Schrödinger equation. For a particle in an externally applied B field, the Pauli equation reads:  where       1  ^   =   (     1    0      0    1     )        normal-^  1     1  0    0  1      \hat{1}=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\
 0&1\\
 \end{pmatrix}     is the 2 × 2 identity matrix , which acts as an identity operator .  The Stern–Gerlach term can obtain the spin orientation of atoms with one valence electron , e.g. silver atoms which flow through an inhomogeneous magnetic field.  Analogously, the term is responsible for the splitting of spectral lines (corresponding to energy levels) in a magnetic field as can be viewed in the anomalous Zeeman effect .
