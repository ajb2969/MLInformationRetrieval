Construction of t-norms

In mathematics, t-norms are a special kind of binary operations on the real unit interval [0, 1]. Various constructions of t-norms, either by explicit definition or by transformation from previously known functions, provide a plenitude of examples and classes of t-norms. This is important, e.g., for finding counter-examples or supplying t-norms with particular properties for use in engineering applications of fuzzy logic. The main ways of construction of t-norms include using generators, defining parametric classes of t-norms, rotations, or ordinal sums of t-norms.
Relevant background can be found in the article on t-norms.
Generators of t-norms
The method of constructing t-norms by generators consists in using a unary function (generator) to transform some known binary function (most often, addition or multiplication) into a t-norm.
In order to allow using non-bijective generators, which do not have the inverse function, the following notion of pseudo-inverse function is employed:

Let f: [a, b] → [c, d] be a monotone function between two closed subintervals of extended real line. The pseudo-inverse function to f is the function f (−1): [c, d] → [a, b] defined as
 
 :


 \sup \{ x\in[a,b] \mid f(x)  y \} & \text{for } f \text{ non-increasing.}
\end{cases}
Additive generators
The construction of t-norms by additive generators is based on the following theorem:

Let f: [0, 1] → [0, +∞] be a strictly decreasing function such that f(1) = 0 and f(x) + f(y) is in the range of f or equal to f(0+) or +∞ for all x, y in [0, 1]. Then the function T: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] defined as
 
T(x, y) = f (-1)(f(x) + f(y))
 


is a t-norm.
 

If a t-norm T results from the latter construction by a function f which is right-continuous in 0, then f is called an additive generator of T.
Examples:

The function f(x) = 1 – x for x in [0, 1] is an additive generator of the Łukasiewicz t-norm.
The function f defined as f(x) = –log(x) if 0 < x ≤ 1 and f(0) = +∞ is an additive generator of the product t-norm.
The function f defined as f(x) = 2 – x if 0 ≤ x < 1 and f(1) = 0 is an additive generator of the drastic t-norm.

Basic properties of additive generators are summarized by the following theorem:

Let f: [0, 1] → [0, +∞] be an additive generator of a t-norm T. Then:
 
T is an Archimedean t-norm.
T is continuous if and only if f is continuous.
T is strictly monotone if and only if f(0) = +∞.
Each element of (0, 1) is a nilpotent element of T if and only if f(0) < +∞.
The multiple of f by a positive constant is also an additive generator of T.
T has no non-trivial idempotents. (Consequently, e.g., the minimum t-norm has no additive generator.)



Multiplicative generators
The isomorphism between addition on [0, +∞] and multiplication on [0, 1] by the logarithm and the exponential function allow two-way transformations between additive and multiplicative generators of a t-norm. If f is an additive generator of a t-norm T, then the function h: [0, 1] → [0, 1] defined as h(x) = e−f (x) is a multiplicative generator of T, that is, a function h such that

h is strictly increasing
h(1) = 1
h(x) · h(y) is in the range of h or equal to 0 or h(0+) for all x, y in [0, 1]
h is right-continuous in 0
T(x, y) = h (−1)(h(x) · h(y)).

Vice versa, if h is a multiplicative generator of T, then f: [0, 1] → [0, +∞] defined by f(x) = −log(h(x)) is an additive generator of T.
Parametric classes of t-norms
Many families of related t-norms can be defined by an explicit formula depending on a parameter p. This section lists the best known parameterized families of t-norms. The following definitions will be used in the list:

A family of t-norms Tp parameterized by p is increasing if Tp(x, y) ≤ Tq(x, y) for all x, y in [0, 1] whenever p ≤ q (similarly for decreasing and strictly increasing or decreasing).


A family of t-norms Tp is continuous with respect to the parameter p if








for all values p0 of the parameter.
 

Schweizer–Sklar t-norms
 The family of Schweizer–Sklar t-norms, introduced by Berthold Schweizer and Abe Sklar in the early 1960s, is given by the parametric definition



A Schweizer–Sklar t-norm 
 
 
 
  is

Archimedean if and only if p > −∞
Continuous if and only if p < +∞
Strict if and only if −∞ < p ≤ 0 (for p = −1 it is the Hamacher product)
Nilpotent if and only if 0 < p < +∞ (for p = 1 it is the Łukasiewicz t-norm).

The family is strictly decreasing for p ≥ 0 and continuous with respect to p in [−∞, +∞]. An additive generator for 
 
 
 
  for −∞ f^{\mathrm{SS}}_p (x) = \begin{cases}
 -\log x           & \text{if } p = 0 \\
 \frac{1 - x^p}{p} & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
Hamacher t-norms
The family of Hamacher t-norms, introduced by Horst Hamacher in the late 1970s, is given by the following parametric definition for 0 ≤ p ≤ +∞:


 
  The t-norm 
 
 
 
  is called the Hamacher product.
Hamacher t-norms are the only t-norms which are rational functions. The Hamacher t-norm 
 
 
 
  is strict if and only if p T^{\mathrm{H}}_p for p f^{\mathrm{H}}_p(x) = \begin{cases}
 \frac{1 - x}{x}            & \text{if } p = 0 \\

\end{cases}

  is strict if and only if 0 T^{\mathrm{D}}_p for 0 T^{\mathrm{D}}_p for 0 f^{\mathrm{D}}_p(x) = \left(\frac{1-x}{x}\right)^p.
Sugeno–Weber t-norms
The family of Sugeno–Weber t-norms was introduced in the early 1980s by Siegfried Weber; the dual t-conorms were defined already in the early 1970s by Michio Sugeno. It is given for −1 ≤ p ≤ +∞ by



The Sugeno–Weber t-norm 
 
 
 
  is nilpotent if and only if −1 T^{\mathrm{SW}}_p for 0 f^{\mathrm{SW}}_p(x) = \begin{cases}
 1 - x   & \text{if } p = 0 \\
 1 - \log_{1 + p}(1 + px) & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
Ordinal sums
The ordinal sum constructs a t-norm from a family of t-norms, by shrinking them into disjoint subintervals of the interval [0, 1] and completing the t-norm by using the minimum on the rest of the unit square. It is based on the following theorem:

Let Ti for i in an index set I be a family of t-norms and (ai, bi) a family of pairwise disjoint (non-empty) open subintervals of [0, 1]. Then the function T: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] defined as
 
 :


 a_i + (b_i - a_i) \cdot T_i\left(\frac{x - a_i}{b_i - a_i}, \frac{y - a_i}{b_i - a_i}\right)
   & \text{if } x, y \in [a_i, b_i]^2 \\
 \min(x, y) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}

is a t-norm.
 

] The resulting t-norm is called the ordinal sum of the summands (Ti, ai, bi) for i in I, denoted by


 
  or 
 
 
 
  if I is finite.
Ordinal sums of t-norms enjoy the following properties:

Each t-norm is a trivial ordinal sum of itself on the whole interval [0, 1].


The empty ordinal sum (for the empty index set) yields the minimum t-norm Tmin. Summands with the minimum t-norm can arbitrarily be added or omitted without changing the resulting t-norm.


It can be assumed without loss of generality that the index set is countable, since the real line can only contain at most countably many disjoint subintervals.


An ordinal sum of t-norm is continuous if and only if each summand is a continuous t-norm. (Analogously for left-continuity.)


An ordinal sum is Archimedean if and only if it is a trivial sum of one Archimedean t-norm on the whole unit interval.


An ordinal sum has zero divisors if and only if for some index i, ai = 0 and Ti has zero divisors. (Analogously for nilpotent elements.)

If 
 
 
 
  is a left-continuous t-norm, then its residuum R is given as follows:


 
  where Ri is the residuum of Ti, for each i in I.
Ordinal sums of continuous t-norms
The ordinal sum of a family of continuous t-norms is a continuous t-norm. By the Mostert–Shields theorem, every continuous t-norm is expressible as the ordinal sum of Archimedean continuous t-norms. Since the latter are either nilpotent (and then isomorphic to the Łukasiewicz t-norm) or strict (then isomorphic to the product t-norm), each continuous t-norm is isomorphic to the ordinal sum of Łukasiewicz and product t-norms.
Important examples of ordinal sums of continuous t-norms are the following ones:

Dubois–Prade t-norms, introduced by Didier Dubois and Henri Prade in the early 1980s, are the ordinal sums of the product t-norm on [0, p] for a parameter p in [0, 1] and the (default) minimum t-norm on the rest of the unit interval. The family of Dubois–Prade t-norms is decreasing and continuous with respect to p..


Mayor–Torrens t-norms, introduced by Gaspar Mayor and Joan Torrens in the early 1990s, are the ordinal sums of the Łukasiewicz t-norm on [0, p] for a parameter p in [0, 1] and the (default) minimum t-norm on the rest of the unit interval. The family of Mayor–Torrens t-norms is decreasing and continuous with respect to p..

Rotations
The construction of t-norms by rotation was introduced by Sándor Jenei (2000). It is based on the following theorem:

Let T be a left-continuous t-norm without zero divisors, N: [0, 1] → [0, 1] the function that assigns 1 − x to x and t = 0.5. Let T1 be the linear transformation of T into [t, 1] and 
 
 
 
  Then the function
 
 :


 T_1(x, y) & \text{if } x, y \in (t, 1] \\
 N(R_{T_1}(x, N(y))) & \text{if } x \in (t, 1] \text{ and } y \in [0, t] \\
 N(R_{T_1}(y, N(x))) & \text{if } x \in [0, t] \text{ and } y \in (t, 1] \\
 0 & \text{if } x, y \in [0, t]
\end{cases}

is a left-continuous t-norm, called the rotation of the t-norm T.
 

 Geometrically, the construction can be described as first shrinking the t-norm T to the interval [0.5, 1] and then rotating it by the angle 2π/3 in both directions around the line connecting the points (0, 0, 1) and (1, 1, 0).
 The theorem can be generalized by taking for N any strong negation, that is, an involutive strictly decreasing continuous function on [0, 1], and for t taking the unique fixed point of N.
The resulting t-norm enjoys the following rotation invariance property with respect to N:

T(x, y) ≤ z if and only if T(y, N(z)) ≤ N(x) for all x, y, z in [0, 1].
 

The negation induced by Trot is the function N, that is, N(x) = Rrot(x, 0) for all x, where Rrot is the residuum of Trot.
