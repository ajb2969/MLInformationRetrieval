   Infinity (philosophy)      Infinity (philosophy)   In philosophy , infinity can be attributed to infinite dimensions, as for instance in Kant's first antinomy . In both theology and philosophy, infinity is explored in articles such as the Ultimate , the Absolute , God , and Zeno's paradoxes . In Greek philosophy , for example in Anaximander , 'the Boundless' is the origin of all that is. He took the beginning or first principle to be an endless, unlimited primordial mass (ἄπειρον, apeiron ). In Judeo-Christian theology , for example in the work of theologians such as Duns Scotus , the infinite nature of God invokes a sense of being without constraint, rather than a sense of being unlimited in quantity. In ethics infinity plays an important role designating that which cannot be defined or reduced to knowledge or power.  History  Early Indian views of infinity  Early thought belonging to Buddhism recognised the existence of the infinite. 1  The Isha Upanishad of the Yajurveda (c. 4th to 3rd century BC) states that "if you remove a part from infinity [ pūrṇa ] or add a part to infinity, still what remains is infinity".  The Jain mathematical text Surya Prajnapti (c. 400 BC) classifies all numbers into three sets: enumerable, innumerable, and infinite. Each of these was further subdivided into three orders:   Enumerable: lowest, intermediate and highest  Innumerable: nearly innumerable, truly innumerable and innumerably innumerable  Infinite: nearly infinite, truly infinite, infinitely infinite   The Jains were the first to discard the idea that all infinites were the same or equal. They recognized different types of infinities: infinite in length (one dimension ), infinite in area (two dimensions), infinite in volume (three dimensions), and infinite perpetually (infinite number of dimensions).  According to Singh (1987), Joseph (2000) and Agrawal (2000), the highest enumerable number N of the Jains corresponds to the modern concept of aleph-null     ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   (the cardinal number of the infinite set of integers 1, 2, ...), the smallest cardinal transfinite number . The Jains also defined a whole system of infinite cardinal numbers, of which the highest enumerable number N is the smallest.  In the Jaina work on the theory of sets , two basic types of infinite numbers are distinguished. On both physical and ontological grounds, a distinction was made between  ("countless, innumerable") and ananta ("endless, unlimited"), between rigidly bounded and loosely bounded infinities.  Early European views of infinity  An early engagement with the idea of infinity was made by Anaximander who considered infinity to be a foundational and primitive basis of reality. 2 In Book 3 of the work entitled Physics , written by Aristotle , Aristotle deals with the concept in terms of his notion of actuality and of potentiality . 3 4 5   This is often called potential infinity; however there are two ideas mixed up with this. One is that it is always possible to find a number of things that surpasses any given number, even if there are not actually such things. The other is that we may quantify over infinite sets without restriction. For example,    ∀  n  ∈  ℤ   (  ∃  m  ∈  ℤ   [  m  >  n  ∧  P   (  m  )   ]   )      fragments  for-all  n   Z   fragments  normal-(   m   Z   fragments  normal-[  m   n   P   fragments  normal-(  m  normal-)   normal-]   normal-)     \forall n\in\mathbb{Z}(\exists m\in\mathbb{Z}[m>n\wedge P(m)])   , which reads, "for any integer n, there exists an integer m > n such that P(m)". The second view is found in a clearer form by medieval writers such as William of Ockham :   The parts are actually there, in some sense. However, on this view, no infinite magnitude can have a number, for whatever number we can imagine, there is always a larger one: "There are not so many (in number) that there are no more." Aquinas also argued against the idea that infinity could be in any sense complete, or a totality.  Aristotle deals with infinity in the context of the prime mover , in Book 7 of the same work, the reasoning of which was later studied and commented on by Simplicius . 6  Plotinus considered infinity, while he was alive, during the 3rd century A.D. 7  Views from the Renaissance to modern times  Galileo  Galileo Galilei acknowledged a fundamental truth in engaging with cognition on the concept of infinity, which is that problems arise only when people attempt to apply finite quantification onto the concept, which is, by definition having a finite quantification which amounts to immeasurably none. 8 Even so, Galileo was the first to notice that we can place an infinite set into one-to-one correspondence with one of its proper subsets (any part of the set, that is not the whole). For example, we can match up the set of square numbers {1, 4, 9, 16, ...} with the natural numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, ...} as follows:   1 → 1 2 → 4 3 → 9 4 → 16 …   It appeared, by this reasoning, as though a set which is naturally smaller than the set of which it is a part (since it does not contain all the members of that set) is in some sense the same "size". Galileo thought this was one of the difficulties which arise when we try, "with our finite minds," to comprehend the infinite.  The idea that size can be measured by one-to-one correspondence is today known as Hume's principle , although Hume, like Galileo, believed the principle could not be applied to infinite sets. (Mathematicians from the time of Georg Cantor  do apply the principle to infinite sets, and do have a notion of some infinite quantities being greater than others.)  John Locke  Locke , in common with most of the empiricist philosophers, also believed that we can have no proper idea of the infinite. They believed all our ideas were derived from sense data or "impressions," and since all sensory impressions are inherently finite, so too are our thoughts and ideas. Our idea of infinity is merely negative or privative.  He considered that in considerations on the subject of eternity, which he classified as an infinity, humans are likely to make mistakes. 9  Thomas Hobbes  Famously, the ultra-empiricist Hobbes tried to defend the idea of a potential infinity in light of the discovery, by Evangelista Torricelli , of a figure ( Gabriel's Horn ) whose surface area is infinite, but whose volume is finite. Not reported, this motivation of Hobbes came too late as curves having infinite length yet bounding finite areas were known much before. Such seeming paradoxes are resolved by taking any finite figure and stretching its content infinitely in one direction; the magnitude of its content is unchanged as its divisions drop off geometrically but the magnitude of its bounds increases to infinity by necessity. Potentiality lies in the definitions of this operation, as well-defined and interconsistent mathematical axioms. A potential infinity is allowed by letting an infinitely-large quantity be cancelled out by an infinitely-small quantity.  Modern philosophical views  Modern discussion of the infinite is now regarded as part of set theory and mathematics. This discussion is generally avoided by philosophers. An exception was Wittgenstein , who made an impassioned attack upon axiomatic set theory , and upon the idea of the actual infinite, during his "middle period". 10   Unlike the traditional empiricists, he thought that the infinite was in some way given to sense experience .  Ethics  The philosopher Emmanuel Levinas uses infinity to designate that which cannot be defined or reduced to knowledge or power. In Levinas' magnum opus Totality and Infinity he says :   Levinas also wrote a work entitled Philosophy and the Idea of Infinity , which was published during 1957. 11  Three types of infinities  Besides the mathematical infinity and the physical infinity, there could also be a philosophical infinity. There are scientists who hold that all three really exist and there are scientists who hold that none of the three exists. And in between there are the various possibilities. Rudy Rucker , in his book Infinity and the Mind—the Science and Philosophy of the Infinite (1982), has worked out a model list of representatives of each of the eight possible standpoints. The footnote on p. 335 of his book suggests the consideration of the following names: Abraham Robinson , Plato , Thomas Aquinas , L.E.J. Brouwer , David Hilbert , Bertrand Russell , Kurt Gödel and Georg Cantor .  Structure of infinity, examples from metaphysics   Eternity : linguistically the opposite of finite, having no edges, limits, an end: How deep is the sky? How can I write down the largest possible number?  Indefinite: How could God be sure that there is no-one greater?  Circularity : The line defining a circle does not have an end.  Recursion : See semantic satiation for instance. Lack of utter reason. Why is that? Apparently, a relevant question after any answer.
