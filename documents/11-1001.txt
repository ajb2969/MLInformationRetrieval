2-hydroxy-3-oxoadipate synthase

In enzymology, a 2-hydroxy-3-oxoadipate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the following chemical reaction:

2-oxoglutarate + glyoxylate 
 
 
 
  2-hydroxy-3-oxoadipate + CO2


The two substrates of this enzyme are 2-oxoglutarate and glyoxylate, whereas its two products are 2-hydroxy-3-oxoadipate and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring aldehyde or ketonic groups (transaldolases and transketolases, respectively). Other names in common use include 2-hydroxy-3-oxoadipate glyoxylate-lyase (carboxylating), alpha-ketoglutaric-glyoxylic carboligase, and oxoglutarate: glyoxylate carboligase. This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. It employs one cofactor, thiamin diphosphate.
