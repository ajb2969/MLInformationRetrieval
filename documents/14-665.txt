Marcum Q-function

In statistics, the Marcum-Q-function

 
  is defined as



 
  is also defined as



with modified Bessel function

 
  of order M − 1. The Marcum Q-function is used for example as a cumulative distribution function for noncentral chi-squared and Rice distributions.
The Marcum Q-function is monotonic and log-concave.1
