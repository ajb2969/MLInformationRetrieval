   File:Prism2.svg      File:Prism2.svg   == Summary == A doublet prism, showing the apex angles (    α  1     subscript  α  1    \alpha_{1}   and    α  2     subscript  α  2    \alpha_{2}   ) of the two elements, and the angles of incidence    θ  i     subscript  θ  i    \theta_{i}   and refraction    θ  i  ′     subscript   superscript  θ  normal-′   i    \theta^{\prime}_{i}   at each interface. The deviation angle of the ray transmitted by the prism is shown as   δ   δ   \delta   .  Licensing  "
