   Josef Kittler      Josef Kittler   Josef Kittler is a British scientist and Distinguished Professor at University of Surrey , specializing in pattern recognition and machine intelligence.  Biography  Josef Kittler received his B.A. in Electrical Engineering (1971), Ph.D. in Pattern Recognition (1974), and ScD (1992), all from University of Cambridge . He joined Surrey University in 1986 and became Distinguished Professor in 2004.  He founded Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP) in 1986 at University of Surrey  1 and served as President of the International Association for Pattern Recognition during 1994-1996. He is Series Editor of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science .  Academic works  On combining classifiers  They proposed the algebraic combination methods under the probabilistic framework 2 3 used in ensembles of classifiers . In detail, denote     h  i  j    (  x  )        subscript   superscript  h  j   i   x    h^{j}_{i}(x)   the probability of instance    x   x   x   belonging to class    c  j     subscript  c  j    c_{j}   output from the learner     h  i     subscript  h  i    h_{i}   , then the median rule generates the combined output according to     H  j    (  x  )   =  m  e  d  i  a  n   (   (   h  i  j    (  x  )   )       fragments   superscript  H  j    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    m  e  d  i  a  n   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(   subscript   superscript  h  j   i    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-)      H^{j}(x)=median((h^{j}_{i}(x))   , where the median operator is over base classifier    i   i   i   . 4  Awards and honors   IAPR Fellow (1998). 5    "For contributions to computer vision and pattern recognition, and for outstanding leadership in IAPR".
