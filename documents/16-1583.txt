Academic works
On combining classifiers
They proposed the algebraic combination methods under the probabilistic framework 23 used in ensembles of classifiers. In detail, denote 
 
 
 
  the probability of instance

 
  belonging to class 
 
 
 
  output from the learner

 
 
 , then the median rule generates the combined output according to 
 
 
 
 , where the median operator is over base classifier
