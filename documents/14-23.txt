   Fundamental group scheme      Fundamental group scheme   In mathematics, the fundamental group scheme is a group scheme canonically associated to a scheme over a Dedekind scheme (e.g. the spectrum of a field or the spectrum of a discrete valuation ring ). It is a generalisation of the étale fundamental group . Although its existence was conjectured by Alexander Grothendieck , the first construction is due to Madhav Nori, 1 2 who only worked on schemes over fields. A generalisation to schemes over Dedekind schemes is due to Carlo Gasbarri. 3  First definition  Let   k   k   k   be a perfect field and    X  →   Spec   (  k  )       normal-→  X    Spec  k     X\to\text{Spec}(k)   a faithfully flat and proper morphism of schemes with   X   X   X   a reduced and connected scheme. Assume the existence of a section    x  :    Spec   (  k  )    →  X      normal-:  x   normal-→    Spec  k   X     x:\text{Spec}(k)\to X   , then the fundamental group scheme     π  1    (  X  ,  x  )        subscript  π  1    X  x     \pi_{1}(X,x)   of   X   X   X   in   x   x   x   is defined as the affine group scheme naturally associated to the neutral tannakian category (over   k   k   k   ) of essentially finite vector bundles over   X   X   X   .  Second definition  Let   S   S   S   be a Dedekind scheme,   X   X   X   any connected scheme (not necessarily reduced) 4 and    X  →  S     normal-→  X  S    X\to S   a faithfully flat morphism of finite type (not necessarily proper). Assume the existence of a section    x  :   S  →  X      normal-:  x   normal-→  S  X     x:S\to X   . Once we prove that the category of isomorphism classes of torsors over   X   X   X   (pointed over   x   x   x   ) under the action of finite and flat   S   S   S   - group schemes is cofiltered then we define the universal torsor (pointed over   x   x   x   ) as the projective limit of all the torsors of that category. The   S   S   S   -group scheme acting on it is called the fundamental group scheme and denoted by     π  1    (  X  ,  x  )        subscript  π  1    X  x     \pi_{1}(X,x)   (when   S   S   S   is the spectrum of a perfect field the two definitions coincide so that no confusion can arise).
