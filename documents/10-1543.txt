   Phosphoadenylyl-sulfate reductase (thioredoxin)      Phosphoadenylyl-sulfate reductase (thioredoxin)   In enzymology , a phosphoadenylyl-sulfate reductase (thioredoxin) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + sulfite + thioredoxin disulfide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + thioredoxin   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate , sulfite , and thioredoxin disulfide , whereas its two products are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and thioredoxin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with a disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate,sulfite:thioredoxin-disulfide oxidoreductase (3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate-forming) . Other names in common use include PAPS reductase, thioredoxin-dependent , PAPS reductase , thioredoxin:adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate reductase , 3'-phosphoadenylylsulfate reductase , thioredoxin:3'-phospho-adenylylsulfate reductase , phosphoadenosine-phosphosulfate reductase , adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate,sulfite:oxidized-thioredoxin , and oxidoreductase (3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate-forming) . This enzyme participates in sulfur metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
