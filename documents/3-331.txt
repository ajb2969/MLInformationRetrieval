Gimel function

In axiomatic set theory, the gimel function is the following function mapping cardinal numbers to cardinal numbers:



where cf denotes the cofinality function; the gimel function is used for studying the continuum function and the cardinal exponentiation function. The symbol 
 
 
 
  is a serif form of the Hebrew letter gimel.
Values of the Gimel function
The gimel function has the property 
 
 
 
  for all infinite cardinals κ by König's theorem.
For regular cardinals 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and Easton's theorem says we don't know much about the values of this function. For singular 
 
 
 
 , upper bounds for 
 
 
 
  can be found from Shelah's PCF theory.
Reducing the exponentiation function to the gimel function
All cardinal exponentiation is determined (recursively) by the gimel function as follows.

If κ is an infinite successor cardinal then 
 
 

If κ is a limit and the continuum function is eventually constant below κ then 
 
 

If κ is a limit and the continuum function is not eventually constant below κ then 
 
 


The remaining rules hold whenever κ and λ are both infinite:

If ℵ0≤κ≤λ then κλ = 2λ
If μλ≥κ for some μ<κ then κλ = μλ
If κ> λ and μλ<κ for all μ<κ and cf(κ)≤λ then κλ = κcf(κ)
If κ> λ and μλ<κ for all μλ then κλ = κ
