Uracil-5-carboxylate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a uracil-5-carboxylate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

uracil 5-carboxylate 
 
 
 
  uracil + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, uracil 5-carboxylate, and two products, uracil and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is uracil-5-carboxylate carboxy-lyase (uracil-forming). Other names in common use include uracil-5-carboxylic acid decarboxylase, and uracil-5-carboxylate carboxy-lyase.
