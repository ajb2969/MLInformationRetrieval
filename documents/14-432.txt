   3-transposition group      3-transposition group   In mathematical group theory , a 3-transposition group is a group generated by a class of involutions such that the product of any two has order at most 3. They were first studied by  who discovered the three Fischer groups as examples of 3-transposition groups.  History  first studied 3-transposition groups in the special case when the product of any two distinct transpositions has order 3. He showed that a finite group with this property is solvable, and has a (nilpotent) 3-group of index 2.  used these groups to construct examples of non-abelian CH-quasigroups and to describe the structure of commutative Moufang loops of exponent 3.  Fischer's theorem  Suppose that G is a group that is generated by conjugacy class of 3-transpositions and such that the 2 and 3 cores  O 2 ( G ) and O 3 ( G ) are both contained in the center Z ( G ) of G . Then  proved that up to isomorphism G / Z ( G ) is one of the following groups and D is the image of the given conjugacy class:   G / Z ( G ) is the trivial group.  G / Z ( G ) is a symmetric group S n for n ≥5, and D is the class of transpositions. (If n =6 there is a second classes of 3-transpositions).  G / Z ( G ) is a symplectic group Sp 2 n (2) with n ≥3 over the field of order 2, and D is the class of transvections. (When n =2 there is a second class of transpositions.)  G / Z ( G ) is a projective special unitary group PSU n (2) with n ≥5, and D is the class of transvections  G / Z ( G ) is an orthogonal group O μ 2 n (2) with n ≥4, and D is the class of transvections  G / Z ( G ) is an index 2 subgroup PO n μ, + (3) of the projective orthogonal group PO n μ (3) (with n ≥5) generated by the class D of reflections of norm +1 vectors.  G / Z ( G ) is one of the three Fischer groups Fi 22 , Fi 23 , Fi 24 .  G / Z ( G ) is one of two groups of the form Ω 8 + (2).S 3 and PΩ 8 + (3).S 3 , where Ω stands for the derived subgroup of the orthogonal group and S 3 is the group of diagram automorphisms for the D 4 Dynkin diagram.   The missing cases with n small above either do not satisfy the condition about 2 and 3 cores or have exceptional isomorphisms to other groups on the list.  Properties  The symmetric group S n has order n ! and for n >1 has a subgroup A n of index 2 that is simple if n >4. The transpositions are the elements that exchange two points. (For n =6 there is a second classes of 2-transpositions.)  The symplectic group Sp 2 n (2) has order       2   n  2     (    2  2   -  1   )    (    2  4   -  1   )   ⋯   (    2   2  n    -  1   )        superscript  2   superscript  n  2       superscript  2  2   1      superscript  2  4   1   normal-⋯     superscript  2    2  n    1     2^{n^{2}}(2^{2}-1)(2^{4}-1)\cdots(2^{2n}-1)   It is simple if n >2, while for n =1 it is S 3 , and for n =2 it is S 6 with a simple subgroup of index 2. The transpositions are of the form x ↦ x +( x , v ) v for non-zero v .  The special unitary group SU n (2) has order       2    n   (   n  -  1   )    /  2     (    2  2   -  1   )    (    2  3   +  1   )   ⋯   (    2  n   -    (   -  1   )   n    )        superscript  2      n    n  1    2       superscript  2  2   1      superscript  2  3   1   normal-⋯     superscript  2  n    superscript    1   n      2^{n(n-1)/2}(2^{2}-1)(2^{3}+1)\cdots(2^{n}-(-1)^{n})   The projective special unitary group PSU n (2) is the quotient of the special unitary group by the center of order (3, n ). It is simple if n >3, while for n =2 it is S 3 and for n =3 it has the structure 3 2 . Q 8 ( Q 8 = quaternion group). The transpositions are of the form x ↦ x +( x , v ) v for non-zero norm zero v .  The orthogonal group O 2 n ± (2) has order       2  ×   2   n   (   n  -  1   )       (    2  2   -  1   )    (    2  4   -  1   )   ⋯   (    2    2  n   -  2    -  1   )    (    2  n   ∓  1   )         2   superscript  2    n    n  1         superscript  2  2   1      superscript  2  4   1   normal-⋯     superscript  2      2  n   2    1    minus-or-plus   superscript  2  n   1     2\times 2^{n(n-1)}(2^{2}-1)(2^{4}-1)\cdots(2^{2n-2}-1)(2^{n}\mp 1)   (Over fields of characteristic 2, orthogonal group in odd dimensions are isomorphic to symplectic groups.) It has an index 2 subgroup, which is simple if n >2. The transpositions are of the form x ↦ x +( x , v ) v for v of non-zero norm.  The orthogonal groups O n ± (3) are the automorphism groups of quadratic forms Q over the field of 3 elements such that the discriminant of the bilinear form Q ( a + b )− Q ( a )− Q ( b ) is ±1. The group O n μ± (3) for μ a sign is the subgroup of O n μ (3) generated by reflections of vectors of norm ±1. If n =2 m +1 is odd the two orthogonal groups O n ± (3) are isomorphic and have order       2  ×   3   m  2      (    3  2   -  1   )    (    3  4   -  1   )   ⋯   (    3   2  m    -  1   )         2   superscript  3   superscript  m  2        superscript  3  2   1      superscript  3  4   1   normal-⋯     superscript  3    2  m    1     2\times 3^{m^{2}}(3^{2}-1)(3^{4}-1)\cdots(3^{2m}-1)   and O n ++ (3) ≅ O n −− (3) (center order 1 for n >3), O n −+ (3) ≅ O n +− (3) (center order 2 for n >3) because the two quadratic forms are scalar multiples of each other. If n =2 m is even the two orthogonal groups O n ± (3) have orders       2  ×   3   m   (   m  -  1   )       (    3  2   -  1   )    (    3  4   -  1   )   ⋯   (    3    2  m   -  2    -  1   )    (    3  m   ∓  1   )         2   superscript  3    m    m  1         superscript  3  2   1      superscript  3  4   1   normal-⋯     superscript  3      2  m   2    1    minus-or-plus   superscript  3  m   1     2\times 3^{m(m-1)}(3^{2}-1)(3^{4}-1)\cdots(3^{2m-2}-1)(3^{m}\mp 1)   and O n ++ (3) ≅ O n +− (3) (center order 2 for n >2), O n −+ (3) ≅ O n −− (3) (center order 1 for n >2) because the two classes of transpositions are exchanged by an element of the general orthogonal group that multiplies the quadratic form by a scalar. The transpositions of the group O n ± (3)are of the form x ↦ x +( x , v ) v /( v , v ) for v of non-zero norm. If n >1 there are two classes of transpositions, corresponding to the two possible norms for v . If n >4 each of these two classes generates a 3-transposition group of index 2 in the orthogonal group. These 3-transposition groups have subgroups of index 2 which are simple modulo their centers (which have orders 1 or 2).  Fi 22 has order 2 17 .3 9 .5 2 .7.11.13 = 64561751654400 and is simple.  Fi 23 has order 2 18 .3 13 .5 2 .7.11.13.17.23 = 4089470473293004800 and is simple.  Fi 24 has order 2 22 .3 16 .5 2 .7 3 .11.13.17.23.29 and has a simple subgroup of index 2.  Isomorphisms and solvable cases  There are numerous degenerate (solvable) cases and isomorphisms between 3-transposition groups of small degree as follows :  Solvable groups  The following groups do not appear in the conclusion of Fisher's theorem as they are solvable (with order a power of 2 times a power of 3).

Suppose that D is the class of 3-transpositions in G , and d ∈ D , and let H be the subgroup generated by the set D d of elements of D commuting with d . Then D d is a set of 3-transpositions of H , so the 3-transposition groups can be classified by induction on the order by finding all possibilities for G given any 3-transposition group H . For simplicity assume that the derived group of G is perfect (this condition is satisfied by all but the two groups involving triality automorphisms.)   If O 3 ( H ) is not contained in Z ( H ) then G is the symmetric group S 5  If O 2 ( H ) is not contained in Z ( H ) then L = H / O 2 ( H ) is a 3-transposition group, and L / Z ( L ) is either of type Sp(2 n , 2) in which case G / Z ( G ) is of type Sp 2 n +2 (2), or of type PSU n (2) in which case G / Z ( G ) is of type PSU n +2 (2)  If H / Z ( H ) is of type S n then either G is of type S n +2 or n = 6 and G is of type O − 6 (2)  If H / Z ( H ) is of type Sp 2 n (2) with 2 n ≥ 6 then G is of type O μ 2 n +2 (2)  H / Z ( H ) cannot be of type O μ 2 n (2) for n ≥ 4.  If H / Z ( H ) is of type PO μ, π n (3) for n >4 then G is of type PO −μπ, π n +1 (3).  If H / Z ( H ) is of type PSU n (2) for n ≥ 5 then n = 6 and G is of type Fi 22 (and H is an exceptional double cover of PSU 6 (2))  If H / Z ( H ) is of type Fi 22 then G is of type Fi 23 and H is a double cover of Fi 22 .  If H / Z ( H ) is of type Fi 23 then G is of type Fi 24 and H is the product of Fi 23 and a group of order 2.  H / Z ( H ) cannot be of type Fi 24 .   3-transpositions and graph theory  It is fruitful to treat 3-transpositions as vertices of a graph . Join the pairs that do not commute, i. e. have a product of order 3. The graph is connected unless the group has a direct product decomposition. The graphs corresponding to the smallest symmetric groups are familiar graphs. The 3 transpositions of S 3 form a triangle. The 6 transpositions of S 4 form an octahedron. The 10 transpositions of S 5 form the complement of the Petersen graph .  The symmetric group S n can be generated by n –1 transpositions: (1 2), (2 3), ..., ( n −1 n ) and the graph of this generating set is a straight line. It embodies sufficient relations to define the group S n . 1  References    contains a complete proof of Fischer's theorem.
