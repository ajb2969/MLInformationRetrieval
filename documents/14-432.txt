3-transposition group

In mathematical group theory, a 3-transposition group is a group generated by a class of involutions such that the product of any two has order at most 3. They were first studied by  who discovered the three Fischer groups as examples of 3-transposition groups.
History
first studied 3-transposition groups in the special case when the product of any two distinct transpositions has order 3. He showed that a finite group with this property is solvable, and has a (nilpotent) 3-group of index 2.  used these groups to construct examples of non-abelian CH-quasigroups and to describe the structure of commutative Moufang loops of exponent 3.
Fischer's theorem
Suppose that G is a group that is generated by conjugacy class of 3-transpositions and such that the 2 and 3 cores O2(G) and O3(G) are both contained in the center Z(G) of G. Then  proved that up to isomorphism G/Z(G) is one of the following groups and D is the image of the given conjugacy class:

G/Z(G) is the trivial group.
G/Z(G) is a symmetric group Sn for n≥5, and D is the class of transpositions. (If n=6 there is a second classes of 3-transpositions).
G/Z(G) is a symplectic group Sp2n(2) with n≥3 over the field of order 2, and D is the class of transvections. (When n=2 there is a second class of transpositions.)
G/Z(G) is a projective special unitary group PSUn(2) with n≥5, and D is the class of transvections
G/Z(G) is an orthogonal group Oμ2n(2) with n≥4, and D is the class of transvections
G/Z(G) is an index 2 subgroup POnμ, +(3) of the projective orthogonal group POnμ(3) (with n≥5) generated by the class D of reflections of norm +1 vectors.
G/Z(G) is one of the three Fischer groups Fi22, Fi23, Fi24.
G/Z(G) is one of two groups of the form Ω8+(2).S3 and PΩ8+(3).S3, where Ω stands for the derived subgroup of the orthogonal group and S3 is the group of diagram automorphisms for the D4 Dynkin diagram.

The missing cases with n small above either do not satisfy the condition about 2 and 3 cores or have exceptional isomorphisms to other groups on the list.
Properties
The symmetric group Sn has order n! and for n>1 has a subgroup An of index 2 that is simple if n>4. The transpositions are the elements that exchange two points. (For n=6 there is a second classes of 2-transpositions.)
The symplectic group Sp2n(2) has order


 
  It is simple if n>2, while for n=1 it is S3, and for n=2 it is S6 with a simple subgroup of index 2. The transpositions are of the form x↦x+(x,v)v for non-zero v.
The special unitary group SUn(2) has order


 
  The projective special unitary group PSUn(2) is the quotient of the special unitary group by the center of order (3,n). It is simple if n>3, while for n=2 it is S3 and for n=3 it has the structure 32.Q8 (Q8 = quaternion group). The transpositions are of the form x↦x+(x,v)v for non-zero norm zero v.
The orthogonal group O2n±(2) has order


 
  (Over fields of characteristic 2, orthogonal group in odd dimensions are isomorphic to symplectic groups.) It has an index 2 subgroup, which is simple if n>2. The transpositions are of the form x↦x+(x,v)v for v of non-zero norm.
The orthogonal groups On±(3) are the automorphism groups of quadratic forms Q over the field of 3 elements such that the discriminant of the bilinear form Q(a+b)−Q(a)−Q(b) is ±1. The group Onμ±(3) for μ a sign is the subgroup of Onμ(3) generated by reflections of vectors of norm ±1. If n=2m+1 is odd the two orthogonal groups On±(3) are isomorphic and have order


 
  and On++(3) ≅ On−−(3) (center order 1 for n>3), On−+(3) ≅ On+−(3) (center order 2 for n>3) because the two quadratic forms are scalar multiples of each other. If n=2m is even the two orthogonal groups On±(3) have orders


 
  and On++(3) ≅ On+−(3) (center order 2 for n>2), On−+(3) ≅ On−−(3) (center order 1 for n>2) because the two classes of transpositions are exchanged by an element of the general orthogonal group that multiplies the quadratic form by a scalar. The transpositions of the group On±(3)are of the form x↦x+(x,v)v/(v,v) for v of non-zero norm. If n>1 there are two classes of transpositions, corresponding to the two possible norms for v. If n>4 each of these two classes generates a 3-transposition group of index 2 in the orthogonal group. These 3-transposition groups have subgroups of index 2 which are simple modulo their centers (which have orders 1 or 2).
Fi22 has order 217.39.52.7.11.13 = 64561751654400 and is simple.
Fi23 has order 218.313.52.7.11.13.17.23 = 4089470473293004800 and is simple.
Fi24 has order 222.316.52.73.11.13.17.23.29 and has a simple subgroup of index 2.
Isomorphisms and solvable cases
There are numerous degenerate (solvable) cases and isomorphisms between 3-transposition groups of small degree as follows :
Solvable groups
The following groups do not appear in the conclusion of Fisher's theorem as they are solvable (with order a power of 2 times a power of 3).


 
  has order 1


 
  has order 2


 
  is elementary abelian of order 4


 
  has order 6


 
  is elementary abelian of order 8


 
  has order 24


 
  has order 72 and is solvable


 
  has order 72, but the subgroup generated by transpositions has index 2 in this.


 
  has order 576
Isomorphisms
There are several further isomorphisms involving groups in the conclusion of Fischer's theorem as follows. This list also identifies the Weyl groups of ADE Dynkin diagrams, which are all 3-transposition groups, with groups on Fischer's list (W stands for Weyl group).


 
  has order 120


 
  has order 720 (and 2 classes of 3-transposition)


 
  has order 40320






























Proof
The idea of the proof is as follows. Suppose that D is the class of 3-transpositions in G, and d∈D, and let H be the subgroup generated by the set Dd of elements of D commuting with d. Then Dd is a set of 3-transpositions of H, so the 3-transposition groups can be classified by induction on the order by finding all possibilities for G given any 3-transposition group H. For simplicity assume that the derived group of G is perfect (this condition is satisfied by all but the two groups involving triality automorphisms.)

If O3(H) is not contained in Z(H) then G is the symmetric group S5
If O2(H) is not contained in Z(H) then L=H/O2(H) is a 3-transposition group, and L/Z(L) is either of type Sp(2n, 2) in which case G/Z(G) is of type Sp2n+2(2), or of type PSUn(2) in which case G/Z(G) is of type PSUn+2(2)
If H/Z(H) is of type Sn then either G is of type Sn+2 or n = 6 and G is of type O−6(2)
If H/Z(H) is of type Sp2n(2) with 2n ≥ 6 then G is of type Oμ2n+2(2)
H/Z(H) cannot be of type Oμ2n(2) for n ≥ 4.
If H/Z(H) is of type POμ, πn(3) for n>4 then G is of type PO−μπ, πn+1(3).
If H/Z(H) is of type PSUn(2) for n ≥ 5 then n = 6 and G is of type Fi22 (and H is an exceptional double cover of PSU6(2))
If H/Z(H) is of type Fi22 then G is of type Fi23 and H is a double cover of Fi22.
If H/Z(H) is of type Fi23 then G is of type Fi24 and H is the product of Fi23 and a group of order 2.
H/Z(H) cannot be of type Fi24.

3-transpositions and graph theory
It is fruitful to treat 3-transpositions as vertices of a graph. Join the pairs that do not commute, i. e. have a product of order 3. The graph is connected unless the group has a direct product decomposition. The graphs corresponding to the smallest symmetric groups are familiar graphs. The 3 transpositions of S3 form a triangle. The 6 transpositions of S4 form an octahedron. The 10 transpositions of S5 form the complement of the Petersen graph.
The symmetric group Sn can be generated by n–1 transpositions: (1 2), (2 3), ..., (n−1 n) and the graph of this generating set is a straight line. It embodies sufficient relations to define the group Sn.1
