   Antenna factor      Antenna factor   In electromagnetics , the antenna factor is defined as the ratio of the electric field strength to the voltage  V (units: V or µV) induced across the terminals of an antenna . The voltage measured at the output terminals of an antenna is not the actual field intensity due to actual antenna gain , aperture characteristics , and loading effects. 1  For an electric field antenna, the field strength is in units of V/m or µV/m and the resulting antenna factor AF is in units of 1/m:       A  F   =   E  V         A  F     E  V     AF=\frac{E}{V}     If all quantities are expressed logarithmically in decibels instead of SI units , the above equation becomes       A   F   dBm   -  1      =    E   dBV  /  m    -   V  dBV    =    E    dB  μ  V   /  m    -   V   dB  μ  V             A   subscript  F   superscript  dBm    1         subscript  E    dBV  normal-m     subscript  V  dBV            subscript  E      dB  μ  normal-V   normal-m     subscript  V    dB  μ  normal-V        AF_{\mathrm{dBm}^{-1}}=E_{\mathrm{\mathrm{dBV/m}}}-V_{\mathrm{dBV}}=E_{\mathrm%
 {\mathrm{dB}\mu\mathrm{V/m}}}-V_{\mathrm{dB}\mu\mathrm{V}}     For a magnetic field antenna, the field strength is in units of A/m and the resulting antenna factor is in units of A/(Vm). For the relationship between the electric and magnetic fields, see the impedance of free space .  For a 50 Ω load, knowing that P D A e = P r = V 2 /R and E 2 =377P D , the antenna factor is developed as:       A  F   =     377   P  D       50   P  D    A  e      =   2.75    A  e     =   9.73   λ   G             A  F         377   subscript  P  D         50   subscript  P  D    subscript  A  e             2.75     subscript  A  e            9.73    λ    G        AF=\frac{\sqrt{377P_{D}}}{\sqrt{50P_{D}A_{e}}}=\frac{2.75}{\sqrt{A_{e}}}=\frac%
 {9.73}{\lambda\sqrt{G}}     Where   A e = (λ 2 G)/4π : the antenna effective aperture  G: the antenna gain   For antennas which are not defined by a physical area, such as monopoles and dipoles consisting of thin rod conductors , the effective length is used to measure the ratio between E and V.
