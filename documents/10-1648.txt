Glucuronate isomerase




Glucuronate isomerase

In enzymology, a glucuronate isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-glucuronate 
 
 
 
  D-fructuronate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, D-glucuronate, and one product, D-fructuronate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases interconverting aldoses and ketoses. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glucuronate aldose-ketose-isomerase. Other names in common use include uronic isomerase, uronate isomerase, D-glucuronate isomerase, uronic acid isomerase, and D-glucuronate ketol-isomerase. This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
