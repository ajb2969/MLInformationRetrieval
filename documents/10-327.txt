JLO cocycle

In noncommutative geometry, the JLO cocycle is a cocycle (and thus defines a cohomology class) in entire cyclic cohomology. It is a non-commutative version of the classic Chern character of the conventional differential geometry. In noncommutative geometry, the concept of a manifold is replaced by a noncommutative algebra 
 
 
 
  of "functions" on the putative noncommutative space. The cyclic cohomology of the algebra 
 
 
 
  contains the information about the topology of that noncommutative space, very much as the de Rham cohomology contains the information about the topology of a conventional manifold.
The JLO cocycle is associated with a metric structure of non-commutative differential geometry known as a 
 
 
 
 -summable Fredholm module (also known as a 
 
 
 
 -summable spectral triple).


 
 -summable Fredholm modules
A 
 
 
 
 -summable Fredholm module consists of the following data:
(a) A Hilbert space

 
  such that 
 
 
 
  acts on it as an algebra of bounded operators.
(b) A 
 
 
 
 -grading 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . We assume that the algebra 
 
 
 
  is even under the 
 
 
 
 -grading, i.e. 
 
 
 
 , for all 
 
 
 
 .
(c) A self-adjoint (unbounded) operator 
 
 
 
 , called the Dirac operator such that

(i) 
 
 
 
  is odd under 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
 .
 


(ii) Each 
 
 
 
  maps the domain of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  into itself, and the operator 
 
 
 
  is bounded.
 


(iii) 
 
 
 
 , for all 
 
 
 
 .
 

A classic example of a 
 
 
 
 -summable Fredholm module arises as follows. Let 
 
 
 
  be a compact spin manifold, 
 
 
 
 , the algebra of smooth functions on 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  the Hilbert space of square integrable forms on 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  the standard Dirac operator.
The cocycle
The JLO cocycle 
 
 
 
  is a sequence



of functionals on the algebra
