   Posterior probability      Posterior probability   In Bayesian statistics , the posterior probability of a random event or an uncertain proposition is the conditional probability that is assigned after the relevant evidence or background is taken into account. Similarly, the posterior probability distribution is the probability distribution of an unknown quantity, treated as a random variable , conditional on the evidence obtained from an experiment or survey. "Posterior", in this context, means after taking into account the relevant evidence related to the particular case being examined.  Definition  The posterior probability is the probability of the parameters   θ   θ   \theta   given the evidence   X   X   X       p   (  θ  |  X  )      fragments  p   fragments  normal-(  θ  normal-|  X  normal-)     p(\theta|X)   .  It contrasts with the likelihood function , which is the probability of the evidence given the parameters    p   (  X  |  θ  )      fragments  p   fragments  normal-(  X  normal-|  θ  normal-)     p(X|\theta)   .  The two are related as follows:  Let us have a prior belief that the probability distribution function is    p   (  θ  )       p  θ    p(\theta)   and observations   x   x   x   with the likelihood    p   (  x  |  θ  )      fragments  p   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-|  θ  normal-)     p(x|\theta)   , then the posterior probability is defined as      p   (  θ  |  x  )   =    p   (  x  |  θ  )   p   (  θ  )     p   (  x  )     .     fragments  p   fragments  normal-(  θ  normal-|  x  normal-)       fragments  p   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-|  θ  normal-)   p   fragments  normal-(  θ  normal-)      p  x    normal-.    p(\theta|x)=\frac{p(x|\theta)p(\theta)}{p(x)}.    1 The posterior probability can be written in the memorable form as      Posterior probability  ∝   Likelihood  ×  Prior probability      proportional-to  Posterior probability    Likelihood  Prior probability     \text{Posterior probability}\propto\text{Likelihood}\times\text{Prior probability}   .  Example  Suppose there is a mixed school having 60% boys and 40% girls as students. The girls wear trousers or skirts in equal numbers; the boys all wear trousers. An observer sees a (random) student from a distance; all the observer can see is that this student is wearing trousers. What is the probability this student is a girl? The correct answer can be computed using Bayes' theorem.  The event   G   G   G   is that the student observed is a girl, and the event   T   T   T   is that the student observed is wearing trousers. To compute the posterior probability    P   (  G  |  T  )      fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  G  normal-|  T  normal-)     P(G|T)   , we first need to know:       P   (  G  )       P  G    P(G)   , or the probability that the student is a girl regardless of any other information. Since the observer sees a random student, meaning that all students have the same probability of being observed, and the percentage of girls among the students is 40%, this probability equals 0.4.      P   (  B  )       P  B    P(B)   , or the probability that the student is not a girl (i.e. a boy) regardless of any other information (   B   B   B   is the complementary event to   G   G   G   ). This is 60%, or 0.6.      P   (  T  |  G  )      fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  T  normal-|  G  normal-)     P(T|G)   , or the probability of the student wearing trousers given that the student is a girl. As they are as likely to wear skirts as trousers, this is 0.5.      P   (  T  |  B  )      fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  T  normal-|  B  normal-)     P(T|B)   , or the probability of the student wearing trousers given that the student is a boy. This is given as 1.      P   (  T  )       P  T    P(T)   , or the probability of a (randomly selected) student wearing trousers regardless of any other information. Since    P   (  T  )   =  P   (  T  |  G  )   P   (  G  )   +  P   (  T  |  B  )   P   (  B  )      fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  T  normal-)    P   fragments  normal-(  T  normal-|  G  normal-)   P   fragments  normal-(  G  normal-)    P   fragments  normal-(  T  normal-|  B  normal-)   P   fragments  normal-(  B  normal-)     P(T)=P(T|G)P(G)+P(T|B)P(B)   (via the law of total probability ), this is     P   (  T  )    =    0.5  ×  0.4   +   1  ×  0.6    =  0.8          P  T       0.5  0.4     1  0.6         0.8     P(T)=0.5\times 0.4+1\times 0.6=0.8   .   Given all this information, the probability of the observer having spotted a girl given that the observed student is wearing trousers can be computed by substituting these values in the formula:      P   (  G  |  T  )   =    P   (  T  |  G  )   P   (  G  )     P   (  T  )     =    0.5  ×  0.4   0.8   =  0.25.     fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  G  normal-|  T  normal-)       fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  T  normal-|  G  normal-)   P   fragments  normal-(  G  normal-)      P  T         0.5  0.4   0.8    0.25.    P(G|T)=\frac{P(T|G)P(G)}{P(T)}=\frac{0.5\times 0.4}{0.8}=0.25.     Calculation  The posterior probability distribution of one random variable given the value of another can be calculated with Bayes' theorem by multiplying the prior probability distribution by the likelihood function , and then dividing by the normalizing constant , as follows:        f   X  ∣  Y  =  y     (  x  )    =     f  X    (  x  )    L   X  ∣  Y  =  y     (  x  )      ∫   -  ∞   ∞     f  X    (  x  )    L   X  ∣  Y  =  y     (  x  )   d  x            subscript  f   fragments  X  normal-∣  Y   y    x        subscript  f  X   x   subscript  L   fragments  X  normal-∣  Y   y    x     superscript   subscript             subscript  f  X   x   subscript  L   fragments  X  normal-∣  Y   y    x  d  x       f_{X\mid Y=y}(x)={f_{X}(x)L_{X\mid Y=y}(x)\over{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{X}(x%
 )L_{X\mid Y=y}(x)\,dx}}     gives the posterior probability density function for a random variable   X   X   X   given the data    Y  =  y      Y  y    Y=y   , where        f  X    (  x  )        subscript  f  X   x    f_{X}(x)   is the prior density of   X   X   X   ,          L   X  ∣  Y  =  y     (  x  )    =    f   Y  ∣  X  =  x     (  y  )           subscript  L   fragments  X  normal-∣  Y   y    x      subscript  f   fragments  Y  normal-∣  X   x    y     L_{X\mid Y=y}(x)=f_{Y\mid X=x}(y)   is the likelihood function as a function of   x   x   x   ,         ∫   -  ∞   ∞     f  X    (  x  )    L   X  ∣  Y  =  y     (  x  )   d  x       superscript   subscript             subscript  f  X   x   subscript  L   fragments  X  normal-∣  Y   y    x  d  x     \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{X}(x)L_{X\mid Y=y}(x)\,dx   is the normalizing constant, and         f   X  ∣  Y  =  y     (  x  )        subscript  f   fragments  X  normal-∣  Y   y    x    f_{X\mid Y=y}(x)   is the posterior density of   X   X   X   given the data    Y  =  y      Y  y    Y=y   .   Classification  In classification posterior probabilities reflect the uncertainty of assessing an observation to particular class, see also Class membership probabilities . While Statistical classification methods by definition generate posterior probabilities, Machine Learners usually supply membership values which do not induce any probabilistic confidence. It is desirable to transform or re-scale membership values to class membership probabilities, since they are comparable and additionally easier applicable for post-processing.
