In combinatorics, a lattice path

 
  in 
 
 
 
  of length 
 
 
 
  with steps in 
 
 
 
  is a sequence 
 
 
 
  such that each consecutive difference 
 
 
 
  lies in 
 
 
 
 . 1 A lattice path may lie in any lattice in 
 
 
 
 ,2 but the integer lattice 
 
 
 
  is most commonly used.
An example of a lattice path in 
 
 
 
  of length 5 with steps in 
 
 
 
  is

North-East lattice paths
A North-East (NE) lattice path is a lattice path in 
 
 
 
  with steps in 
 
 
 
 . The 
 
 
 
  steps are called North steps and denoted by 
 
 
 
 's; the 
 
 
 
  steps are called East steps and denoted by 
 
 
 
 's.
NE lattice paths most commonly begin at the origin. This convention allows us to encode all the information about a NE lattice path 
 
 
 
  in a single permutation word. The length of the word gives us the number of steps of the lattice path, 
 
 
 
 . The order of the 
 
 
 
 's and 
 
 
 
 's communicates the sequence of 
 
 
 
 . Furthermore, the number of 
 
 
 
 's and the number of 
 
 
 
 's in the word determines the end point of 
 
 
 
 .
If the permutation word for a NE lattice path contains 
 
 

 
 steps and 
 
 

 
  steps, and if the path begins at the origin, then the path necessarily ends at 
 
 
 
 . This follows because you have "walked" exactly 
 
 
 
  steps North and 
 
 
 
  steps East from 
 
 
 
 .

Counting lattice paths
Lattice paths are often used to count other combinatorial objects. Similarly, there are many combinatorial objects that count the number of lattice paths of a certain kind. This occurs when the lattice paths are in bijection with the object in question. For example,

Dyck paths are counted by the 
 
 
Catalan number

 
 . A Dyck path is a lattice path in



 
  from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  with steps in 
 
 
 
  that never passes below the 
 
 
 
 -axis.3 Equivalently, A Dyck path is a NE lattice path from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  that lies strictly below (but may touch) the diagonal 
 
 
 
 .45

The Schröder numbers count the number of lattice paths from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  with steps in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  that never rise above the line

The number of NE lattice paths from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  counts the number of combinations of 
 
 
 
  objects out of a set of 
 
 
 
  objects.

Combinations and NE lattice paths
NE lattice paths have close connections to the number of combinations, which are counted by the binomial coefficient, and arranged in Pascal's triangle. The diagram below demonstrates some of these connections.
(Figure)
The number of lattice paths from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  is equal to 
 
 
 
 .|center

The number of lattice paths from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  is equal to the binomial coefficient

 
 . The diagram shows this for 
 
 
 
 . If one rotates the diagram 135° clockwise about the origin and extend it to include all 
 
 
 
 , one obtains Pascal's triangle. This result is no surprise, because the 
 
 
 
  entry of the 
 
 
 
  row of Pascal's Triangle is the binomial coefficient 
 
 
 
 .
Problems and proofs
The graphical representation of NE lattice paths lends itself to many bijective proofs involving combinations. Here are a few examples.



 
 .

Proof: The right-hand side is equal to the number of NE lattice paths from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . Each of these NE lattice paths intersects exactly one of the lattice points in the rectangular array with coordinates 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 . This is shown in the figure below for 
 
 
 
 : Every NE lattice path from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  intersects exactly one of the colored nodes.

Each NE lattice path passes through exactly one colored node.|center

On the left-hand side, the binomial coefficient squared, 
 
 
 
 , represents two copies of the set of NE lattice paths from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  attached endpoint to start point. Rotate the second copy 90° clockwise. This does not change the combinatorics of the object
 
 
 
 . So the total number of lattice paths remains the same.

Superimpose the NE lattice paths squared onto the same rectangular array, as seen in the figure below. We see that all NE lattice paths from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  are accounted for. In particular, notice that any lattice path passing through the red lattice point (for example) is counted by the squared set of lattice paths (also shown in red).
