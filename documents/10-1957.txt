   Citrate (pro-3S)-lyase      Citrate (pro-3S)-lyase   In enzymology , a citrate (pro-3S)-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   citrate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetate + oxaloacetate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , citrate , and two products , acetate and oxaloacetate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the oxo-acid-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is citrate oxaloacetate-lyase (forming acetate from the pro-S carboxymethyl group of citrate) . Other names in common use include citrase , citratase , citritase , citridesmolase , citrate aldolase , citric aldolase , citrate lyase , citrate oxaloacetate-lyase , and citrate oxaloacetate-lyase [(pro-3S)-CH2COO-->acetate] . This enzyme participates in citrate cycle (tca cycle) and two-component system - general .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
