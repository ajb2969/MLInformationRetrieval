   Cobordism ring      Cobordism ring   In mathematics, the oriented cobordism ring is a ring where elements are oriented cobordism classes 1 of manifolds, the multiplication is given by the Cartesian product of manifolds and the addition is given as the disjoint union of manifolds. The ring is graded by dimensions of manifolds and is denoted by       Ω  *   S  O    =    ⊕  0  ∞    Ω  n   S  O          subscript   superscript  normal-Ω    S  O        superscript   subscript  direct-sum  0      subscript   superscript  normal-Ω    S  O    n      \Omega^{SO}_{*}=\oplus_{0}^{\infty}\Omega^{SO}_{n}   where    Ω  n   S  O      subscript   superscript  normal-Ω    S  O    n    \Omega^{SO}_{n}   consists of oriented cobordism classes of manifolds of dimension n . One can also define an unoriented cobordism ring , denoted by    Ω  *  O     subscript   superscript  normal-Ω  O      \Omega^{O}_{*}   . If O is replaced U , then one gets the complex cobordism ring , oriented or unoriented.  In general, one writes    Ω  *  B     subscript   superscript  normal-Ω  B      \Omega^{B}_{*}   for the cobordism ring of manifolds with structure B .  A theorem of Thom 2 says:       Ω  n  O   =    π  n    (   M  O   )         subscript   superscript  normal-Ω  O   n      subscript  π  n     M  O      \Omega^{O}_{n}=\pi_{n}(MO)   where MO is the Thom spectrum .
