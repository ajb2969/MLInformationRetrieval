4-aminobutyrate transaminase

In enzymology, 4-aminobutyrate transaminase (), also called GABA transaminase or 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:

4-aminobutanoate + 2-oxoglutarate 
 
 
 
  succinate semialdehyde + L-glutamate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-aminobutanoate (GABA) and 2-oxoglutarate. The two products are succinate semialdehyde and L-glutamate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-aminobutanoate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase. This enzyme participates in 5 metabolic pathways: alanine and aspartate metabolism, glutamate metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism, propanoate metabolism, and butanoate metabolism. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
