   Taylor state      Taylor state   In plasma physics , a Taylor state is the minimum energy state of a plasma satisfying the constraint of conserving magnetic helicity . 1  Derivation  Consider a closed, simply-connected, flux-conserving, perfectly conducting surface   S   S   S   surrounding a plasma with negligible thermal energy (    β  →  0     normal-→  β  0    \beta\rightarrow 0   ).  Since      B  →   ⋅    d  s   →    =  0       normal-⋅   normal-→  B    normal-→    d  s     0    \vec{B}\cdot\vec{ds}=0   on   S   S   S   . This implies that      A  →    |  |    =  0       subscript   normal-→  A    fragments  normal-|  normal-|    0    \vec{A}_{||}=0   .  As discussed above, the plasma would relax towards a minimum energy state while conserving its magnetic helicity. Since the boundary is perfectly conducting, there cannot be any change in the associated flux. This implies      δ   B  →    ⋅    d  s   →    =  0       normal-⋅    δ   normal-→  B     normal-→    d  s     0    \delta\vec{B}\cdot\vec{ds}=0   and     δ    A  →    |  |     =  0        δ   subscript   normal-→  A    fragments  normal-|  normal-|     0    \delta\vec{A}_{||}=0   on   S   S   S   .  We formulate a variational problem of minimizing the plasma energy    W  =   ∫      d  3   r   B  2    /  2    μ  ∘         W           superscript  d  3   r   superscript  B  2    2    subscript  μ        W=\int d^{3}rB^{2}/2\mu_{\circ}   while conserving magnetic helicity    K  =   ∫     d  3   r   A  →    ⋅   B  →         K     normal-⋅     superscript  d  3   r   normal-→  A     normal-→  B       K=\int d^{3}r\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}   .  The variational problem is      δ  W   -   λ  δ  K    =  0          δ  W     λ  δ  K    0    \delta W-\lambda\delta K=0   .  After some algebra this leads to the following constraint for the minimum energy state       ∇  ×   B  →    =   λ   B  →          normal-∇   normal-→  B      λ   normal-→  B      \nabla\times\vec{B}=\lambda\vec{B}   .
