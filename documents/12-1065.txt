Taylor state

In plasma physics, a Taylor state is the minimum energy state of a plasma satisfying the constraint of conserving magnetic helicity.1
Derivation
Consider a closed, simply-connected, flux-conserving, perfectly conducting surface 
 
 
 
  surrounding a plasma with negligible thermal energy (
 
 
 
 ).
Since 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 . This implies that 
 
 
 
 .
As discussed above, the plasma would relax towards a minimum energy state while conserving its magnetic helicity. Since the boundary is perfectly conducting, there cannot be any change in the associated flux. This implies 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 .
We formulate a variational problem of minimizing the plasma energy 
 
 
 
  while conserving magnetic helicity 
 
 
 
 .
The variational problem is 
 
 
 
 .
After some algebra this leads to the following constraint for the minimum energy state
