   Parasitic number      Parasitic number   An n - parasitic number (in base 10) is a positive natural number which can be multiplied by n by moving the rightmost digit of its decimal representation to the front. Here n is itself a single-digit positive natural number. In other words, the decimal representation undergoes a right circular shift by one place. For example, 4•128205=512820, so 128205 is 4-parasitic. Most authors do not allow leading zeros to be used, and this article follows that convention. So even though 4•025641=102564, the number 025641 is not 4-parasitic.  Derivation  An n -parasitic number can be derived by starting with a digit k (which should be equal to n or greater) in the rightmost (units) place, and working up one digit at a time. For example, for n = 4 and k = 7   4•7=2 8   4•87=3 48   4•487=1 948   4•9487=3 7948   4•79487=3 17948   4•179487= 717948 .   So 179487 is a 4-parasitic number with units digit 7. Others are 179487179487, 179487179487179487 etc.  Notice that the repeating decimal       x  =   0.179487179487179487  …   =   0.   179487  ¯   has  4  x   =   0.   717948  ¯    =    7.   179487  ¯    10    .        x    0.179487179487179487  normal-…          0.   normal-¯  179487   has  4  x          0.   normal-¯  717948             7.   normal-¯  179487    10      x=0.179487179487179487\ldots=0.\overline{179487}\mbox{ has }4x=0.\overline{717%
 948}=\frac{7.\overline{179487}}{10}.   Thus        4  x   =     7  +  x   10   so  x   =   7  39    .          4  x         7  x   10   so  x          7  39      4x=\frac{7+x}{10}\mbox{ so }x=\frac{7}{39}.     In general, an n -parasitic number can be found as follows. Pick a one digit integer k such that , and take the period of the repeating decimal  k /(10 n −1). This will be     k    10  n   -  1     (    10  m   -  1   )         k      10  n   1       superscript  10  m   1     \frac{k}{10n-1}(10^{m}-1)   where m is the length of the period; i.e. the multiplicative order of 10 modulo .  For another example, if n = 2, then 10 n − 1 = 19 and the repeating decimal for 1/19 is        1  19   =   0.   052631578947368421  ¯     .        1  19     0.   normal-¯  052631578947368421      \frac{1}{19}=0.\overline{052631578947368421}.     So that for 2/19 is double that:        2  19   =   0.   105263157894736842  ¯     .        2  19     0.   normal-¯  105263157894736842      \frac{2}{19}=0.\overline{105263157894736842}.     The length m of this period is 18, the same as the order of 10 modulo 19, so = 105263157894736842.  105263157894736842 × 2 = 210526315789473684, which is the result of moving the last digit of 105263157894736842 to the front.  Smallest n-parasitic numbers  The smallest n -parasitic numbers are also known as Dyson numbers , after a puzzle concerning these numbers posed by Freeman Dyson . 1 2 3 They are:      n   Smallest n -parasitic number   period of       1   1   1/9     2   105263157894736842   2/19     3   1034482758620689655172413793   3/29     4   102564   4/39     5   142857   7 /49=1/7     6   1016949152542372881355932203389830508474576271186440677966   6/59     7   1014492753623188405797   7/69     8   1012658227848   8/79     9   10112359550561797752808988764044943820224719   9/89     General note  In general, if we relax the rules to allow a leading zero, then there are 9 n -parasitic numbers for each n . Otherwise only if k ≥ n then the numbers do not start with zero and hence fit the actual definition.  Other n -parasitic integers can be built by concatenation. For example, since 179487 is a 4-parasitic number, so are 179487179487, 179487179487179487 etc.  See also   Cyclic number   Notes  References   C. A.
