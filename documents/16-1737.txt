   Foundational relation      Foundational relation   In set theory , a foundational relation on a set or proper class lets each nonempty subset admit a relational minimal element .  Formally, let ( A , R ) be a binary relation structure, where A is a class (set or proper class), and R is a binary relation defined on A . Then ( A , R ) is a foundational relation if and only if any nonempty subset in A has a R -minimal element. In predicate logic ,       (  ∀  S  )    (  S  ⊆  A  ∧  S  ≠  ∅  ⇒   (  ∃  x  ∈  S  )    (  S  ∩   R   -  1     {  x  }   =  ∅  )   )   ,     fragments   fragments  normal-(  for-all  S  normal-)    fragments  normal-(  S   A   S    normal-⇒   fragments  normal-(   x   S  normal-)    fragments  normal-(  S    superscript  R    1     fragments  normal-{  x  normal-}     normal-)   normal-)   normal-,    (\forall S)\left(S\subseteq A\wedge S\not=\emptyset\Rightarrow(\exists x\in S)%
 (S\cap R^{-1}\{x\}=\emptyset)\right),    1 in which ∅ denotes the empty set , and R −1 { x } denotes the class of the elements that precede x in the relation R . That is,         R   -  1     {  x  }    =   {  y  |   y  R  x   }    .         superscript  R    1     x     conditional-set  y    y  R  x      R^{-1}\{x\}=\{y|yRx\}.    2 Here x is an R -minimal element in the subset S , since none of its R -predecessors is in S .
