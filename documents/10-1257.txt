5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconic-semialdehyde dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconic-semialdehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde + H2O + NAD+

 
  5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate + NADH + 2 H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde, H2O, and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconic-semialdehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called carboxymethylhydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism.
