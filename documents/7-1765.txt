   Haynes–Shockley experiment      Haynes–Shockley experiment   In semiconductor physics , the Haynes–Shockley experiment was an experiment that demonstrated that diffusion of minority carriers in a semiconductor could result in a current . The experiment was reported in a short paper by Haynes and Shockley in 1948, 1 with a more detailed version published by Shockley, Pearson, and Haynes in 1949. 2 3 The experiment can be used to measure carrier mobility , carrier lifetime , and diffusion coefficient .  In the experiment, a piece of semiconductor gets a pulse of holes , for example, as induced by voltage or a short laser pulse.  Equations  To see the effect, we consider a n-type semiconductor with the length d . We are interested in determining the mobility of the carriers, diffusion constant and relaxation time . In the following, we reduce the problem to one dimension.  The equations for electron and hole currents are:       j  e   =    +    μ  n   n  E    +    D  n     ∂  n    ∂  x           subscript  j  e          subscript  μ  n   n  E       subscript  D  n       n     x        j_{e}=+\mu_{n}nE+D_{n}\frac{\partial n}{\partial x}          j  p   =    +    μ  p   p  E    -    D  p     ∂  p    ∂  x           subscript  j  p          subscript  μ  p   p  E       subscript  D  p       p     x        j_{p}=+\mu_{p}pE-D_{p}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}     where the j s are the current densities of electrons ( e ) and holes ( p ), the μ s the charge carrier mobilities, E is the electric field , n and p the number densities of charge carriers, the D s are diffusion coefficients , and x is position. The first term of the equations is the drift current , and the second term is the diffusion current .  Derivation  We consider the continuity equation :        ∂  n    ∂  t    =     -   (   n  -   n  0    )     τ  n    -    ∂   j  e     ∂  x             n     t            n   subscript  n  0      subscript  τ  n         subscript  j  e      x       \frac{\partial n}{\partial t}=\frac{-(n-n_{0})}{\tau_{n}}-\frac{\partial j_{e}%
 }{\partial x}           ∂  p    ∂  t    =     -   (   p  -   p  0    )     τ  p    -    ∂   j  p     ∂  x             p     t            p   subscript  p  0      subscript  τ  p         subscript  j  p      x       \frac{\partial p}{\partial t}=\frac{-(p-p_{0})}{\tau_{p}}-\frac{\partial j_{p}%
 }{\partial x}   Subscript 0s indicate equilibrium concentrations. The electrons and the holes recombine with the carrier lifetime τ.  We define        p  1   =   p  -    p  0      ,    n  1   =   n  -   n  0        formulae-sequence     subscript  p  1     p   subscript  p  0        subscript  n  1     n   subscript  n  0       p_{1}=p-p_{0}\,,\quad n_{1}=n-n_{0}     so the upper equations can be rewritten as:        ∂   p  1     ∂  t    =     D  p      ∂  2    p  1     ∂   x  2      -    μ  p   p    ∂  E    ∂  x     -    μ  p   E    ∂   p  1     ∂  x     -    p  1    τ  p              subscript  p  1      t         subscript  D  p       superscript   2    subscript  p  1       superscript  x  2         subscript  μ  p   p      E     x        subscript  μ  p   E       subscript  p  1      x        subscript  p  1    subscript  τ  p       \frac{\partial p_{1}}{\partial t}=D_{p}\frac{\partial^{2}p_{1}}{\partial x^{2}%

 }-\frac{n_{1}}{\tau_{n}}     In a simple approximation, we can consider the electric field to be constant between the left and right electrodes and neglect ∂ E /∂ x . However, as electrons and holes diffuse at different speeds, the material has a local electric charge, inducing an inhomogeneous electric field which can be calculated with Gauss's law :        ∂  E    ∂  x    =   ρ   ϵ   ϵ  0     =     e  0    (    (   p  -   p  0    )   -   (   n  -   n  0    )    )     ϵ   ϵ  0     =     e  0    (    p  1   -   n  1    )     ϵ   ϵ  0               E     x      ρ    ϵ   subscript  ϵ  0               subscript  e  0       p   subscript  p  0      n   subscript  n  0        ϵ   subscript  ϵ  0               subscript  e  0      subscript  p  1    subscript  n  1       ϵ   subscript  ϵ  0        \frac{\partial E}{\partial x}=\frac{\rho}{\epsilon\epsilon_{0}}=\frac{e_{0}((p%

 \epsilon_{0}}     where ε is permittivity, ε 0 the permittivity of free space, ρ is charge density, and e 0 elementary charge.  Next, change variables by the substitutions:         p  1   =    n  mean   +   δ     ,    n  1   =    n  mean   -   δ      ,     formulae-sequence     subscript  p  1      subscript  n  mean   δ       subscript  n  1      subscript  n  mean   δ      p_{1}=n_{\text{mean}}+\delta\,,\quad n_{1}=n_{\text{mean}}-\delta\,,   and suppose δ to be much smaller than    n  mean     subscript  n  mean    n_{\text{mean}}   . The two initial equations write:        ∂   n  mean     ∂  t    =     D  p      ∂  2    n  mean     ∂   x  2      -    μ  p   p    ∂  E    ∂  x     -    μ  p   E    ∂   n  mean     ∂  x     -    n  mean    τ  p              subscript  n  mean      t         subscript  D  p       superscript   2    subscript  n  mean       superscript  x  2         subscript  μ  p   p      E     x        subscript  μ  p   E       subscript  n  mean      x        subscript  n  mean    subscript  τ  p       \frac{\partial n_{\text{mean}}}{\partial t}=D_{p}\frac{\partial^{2}n_{\text{%

The semiconductor behaves as if there were only holes traveling in it.  The final equation for the carriers is:        n  mean    (  x  ,  t  )    =   A   1    4  π   D  *   t      e   -   t  /   τ  *       e   -     (    x  +    μ  *   E  t    -   x  0    )   2    4   D  *   t              subscript  n  mean    x  t      A    1      4  π   superscript  D    t      superscript  e      t   superscript  τ        superscript  e       superscript      x     superscript  μ    E  t     subscript  x  0    2     4   superscript  D    t         n_{\text{mean}}(x,t)=A\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi D^{*}t}}e^{-t/\tau^{*}}e^{-\frac{(x+%

Holes then start to travel towards the electrode where we detect them. The signal then is Gaussian curve shaped.  Parameters μ, D and τ can be obtained from the shape of the signal.       μ  *   =   d   E   t  0          superscript  μ      d    E   subscript  t  0       \mu^{*}=\frac{d}{Et_{0}}          D  *   =     (    μ  *   E   )   2      (   δ  t   )   2    16   t  0           superscript  D       superscript     superscript  μ    E   2      superscript    δ  t   2     16   subscript  t  0        D^{*}=(\mu^{*}E)^{2}\frac{(\delta t)^{2}}{16t_{0}}     where d is the distance drifted in time t 0 , and δt the pulse width .
