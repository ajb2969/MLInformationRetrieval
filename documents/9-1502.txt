Scatter matrix


For the notion in quantum mechanics, see scattering matrix.


In multivariate statistics and probability theory, the scatter matrix is a statistic that is used to make estimates of the covariance matrix, for instance of the multivariate normal distribution.
Definition
Given n samples of m-dimensional data, represented as the m-by-n matrix, 
 
 
 
 , the sample mean is



where 
 
 
 
  is the jth column of 
 
 
 
 .
The scatter matrix is the m-by-m positive semi-definite matrix



where 
 
 
 
  denotes matrix transpose, and multiplication is with regards to the outer product. The scatter matrix may be expressed more succinctly as



where 
 
 
 
  is the n-by-n centering matrix.
Application
The maximum likelihood estimate, given n samples, for the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution can be expressed as the normalized scatter matrix



When the columns of 
 
 
 
  are independently sampled from a multivariate normal distribution, then 
 
 
 
  has a Wishart distribution.
