3-(imidazol-5-yl)lactate dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a 3-(imidazol-5-yl)lactate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-3-(imidazol-5-yl)lactate + NAD(P)+ 
 
 
 
  3-(imidazol-5-yl)pyruvate + NAD(P)H + H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (S)-3-(imidazol-5-yl)lactate, NAD+, and NADP+, whereas its 4 products are 3-(imidazol-5-yl)pyruvate, NADH, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-3-(imidazol-5-yl)lactate:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called imidazol-5-yl lactate dehydrogenase.
