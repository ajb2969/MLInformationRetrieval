16S rRNA (guanine966-N2)-methyltransferase

16S rRNA (guanine966-N2)-methyltransferase (, yhhF (gene), rsmD (gene), m2G966 methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (guanine966-N2)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine966 in 16S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N2-methylguanine966 in 16S rRNA
 

The enzyme efficiently methylates guanine966 of the assembled 30S subunits in vitro.
