Pre-Lie algebra

In mathematics, a pre-Lie algebra is an algebraic structure on a vector space, that describes some properties of objects such as rooted trees and vector fields on affine space.
The notion of pre-Lie algebra has been introduced by Murray Gerstenhaber in his work on deformations of algebras.
Pre-Lie algebras have been considered under some other names, among which one can cite left-symmetric algebras, right-symmetric algebras or Vinberg algebras.
Definition
A pre-Lie algebra 
 
 
 
  is a vector space 
 
 
 
  with a bilinear map 
 
 
 
 , satisfying the relation 
 
 

This identity can be seen as the invariance of the associator

 
  under the exchange of the two variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Every associative algebra is hence also a pre-Lie algebra, as the associator vanishes identically.
Examples

Vector fields on the affine space

If we denote by 
 
 
 
  the vector field 
 
 
 
 
 , and if we define 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 , we can see that the operator 
 
 
 
  is exactly the application of the 
 
 
 
  field to 
 
 
 
 
  field. 
 
 

If we study the difference between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
  which is symmetric on y and z.

Rooted trees

Let 
 
 
 
 
  be the vector space spanned by all rooted trees.
One can introduce a bilinear product 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  as follows. Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be two rooted trees.



where 
 
 
 
  is the rooted tree obtained by adding to the disjoint union of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  an edge going from the vertex 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 
  to the root vertex of 
 
 
 
 .
Then 
 
 
 
  is a free pre-Lie algebra on one generator.
