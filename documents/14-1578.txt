   In-crowd algorithm      In-crowd algorithm   The in-crowd algorithm is a numerical method for solving basis pursuit denoising quickly; faster than any other algorithm for large, sparse problems. 1 Basis pursuit denoising is the following optimization problem:          min  x    1  2      ∥   y  -   A  x    ∥   2  2    +   λ    ∥  x  ∥   1     .          subscript   x     1  2     subscript   superscript   norm    y    A  x     2   2      λ   subscript   norm  x   1      \min_{x}\frac{1}{2}\|y-Ax\|^{2}_{2}+\lambda\|x\|_{1}.     where   y   y   y   is the observed signal,   x   x   x   is the sparse signal to be recovered,    A  x      A  x    Ax   is the expected signal under   x   x   x   , and   λ   λ   \lambda   is the regularization parameter trading off signal fidelity and simplicity.  It consists of the following:   Declare   x   x   x   to be 0, so the unexplained residual    r  =  y      r  y    r=y     Declare the active set   I   I   I   to be the empty set  Calculate the usefulness     u  j   =   |   ⟨   r   A  j    ⟩   |        subscript  u  j      delimited-⟨⟩    r   subscript  A  j        u_{j}=|\langle rA_{j}\rangle|   for each component in    I  c     superscript  I  c    I^{c}     If on    I  c     superscript  I  c    I^{c}   , no     u  j   >  λ       subscript  u  j   λ    u_{j}>\lambda   , terminate  Otherwise, add    L  ≈  25      L  25    L\approx 25   components to   I   I   I   based on their usefulness  Solve basis pursuit denoising exactly on   I   I   I   , and throw out any component of   I   I   I   whose value attains exactly 0. This problem is dense, so quadratic programming techniques work very well for this sub problem.  Update    r  =   y  -   A  x        r    y    A  x      r=y-Ax   - n.b. can be computed in the subproblem as all elements outside of   I   I   I   are 0  Go to step 3.   Since every time the in-crowd algorithm performs a global search it adds up to   L   L   L   components to the active set, it can be a factor of   L   L   L   faster than the best alternative algorithms when this search is computationally expensive. A theorem 2 guarantees that the global optimum is reached in spite of the many-at-a-time nature of the in-crowd algorithm.
