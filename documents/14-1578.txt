In-crowd algorithm

The in-crowd algorithm is a numerical method for solving basis pursuit denoising quickly; faster than any other algorithm for large, sparse problems.1 Basis pursuit denoising is the following optimization problem:



where 
 
 
 
  is the observed signal, 
 
 
 
  is the sparse signal to be recovered, 
 
 
 
  is the expected signal under 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the regularization parameter trading off signal fidelity and simplicity.
It consists of the following:

Declare 
 
 
 
  to be 0, so the unexplained residual 
 
 

Declare the active set 
 
 
 
  to be the empty set
Calculate the usefulness 
 
 
 
  for each component in 
 
 

If on 
 
 
 
 , no 
 
 
 
 , terminate
Otherwise, add 
 
 
 
  components to 
 
 
 
  based on their usefulness
Solve basis pursuit denoising exactly on 
 
 
 
 , and throw out any component of 
 
 
 
  whose value attains exactly 0. This problem is dense, so quadratic programming techniques work very well for this sub problem.
Update 
 
 
 
  - n.b. can be computed in the subproblem as all elements outside of 
 
 
 
  are 0
Go to step 3.

Since every time the in-crowd algorithm performs a global search it adds up to 
 
 
 
  components to the active set, it can be a factor of 
 
 
 
  faster than the best alternative algorithms when this search is computationally expensive. A theorem2 guarantees that the global optimum is reached in spite of the many-at-a-time nature of the in-crowd algorithm.
