Menger curvature

In mathematics, the Menger curvature of a triple of points in n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn is the reciprocal of the radius of the circle that passes through the three points. It is named after the Austrian-American mathematician Karl Menger.
Definition
Let x, y and z be three points in Rn; for simplicity, assume for the moment that all three points are distinct and do not lie on a single straight line. Let Π ⊆ Rn be the Euclidean plane spanned by x, y and z and let C ⊆ Π be the unique Euclidean circle in Π that passes through x, y and z (the circumcircle of x, y and z). Let R be the radius of C. Then the Menger curvature c(x, y, z) of x, y and z is defined by



If the three points are collinear, R can be informally considered to be +∞, and it makes rigorous sense to define c(x, y, z) = 0. If any of the points x, y and z are coincident, again define c(x, y, z) = 0.
Using the well-known formula relating the side lengths of a triangle to its area, it follows that



where A denotes the area of the triangle spanned by x, y and z.
Another way of computing Menger curvature is the identity


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the angle made at the y-corner of the triangle spanned by x,y,z.
Menger curvature may also be defined on a general metric space. If X is a metric space and x,y, and z are distinct points, let f be an isometry from 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
 . Define the Menger curvature of these points to be



Note that f need not be defined on all of X, just on {x,y,z}, and the value cX (x,y,z) is independent of the choice of f.
Integral Curvature Rectifiability
Menger curvature can be used to give quantitative conditions for when sets in 
 
 
 
  may be rectifiable. For a Borel measure

 
  on a Euclidean space 
 
 
 
  define




A Borel set 
 
 
 
  is rectifiable if 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes one-dimensional Hausdorff measure restricted to the set 
 
 
 
 .1

The basic intuition behind the result is that Menger curvature measures how straight a given triple of points are (the smaller 
 
 
 
  is, the closer x,y, and z are to being collinear), and this integral quantity being finite is saying that the set E is flat on most small scales. In particular, if the power in the integral is larger, our set is smoother than just being rectifiable2

Let

  be a homeomorphism and

In the opposite direction, there is a result of Peter Jones:3

If 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is rectifiable. Then there is a positive Radon measure 
 
 
 
  supported on 
 
 
 
  satisfying 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  (in particular, this measure is the Frostman measure associated to E). Moreover, if $H^{1}(B(x,r)\cap\Gamma)\leq Cr$ for some constant C and all $x\in \Gamma$ and r>0, then $c^{2}(H^{1}|_{E})<\infty$. This last result follows from the Analyst's Traveling Salesman Theorem.

Analogous results hold in general metric spaces:4
