Malnormal subgroup

In mathematics, in the field of group theory, a subgroup

 
  of a group

 
  is termed malnormal if for any 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  but not in 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  intersect in the identity element.1
Some facts about malnormality:

An intersection of malnormal subgroups is malnormal.2
Malnormality is transitive, that is, a malnormal subgroup of a malnormal subgroup is malnormal.3
The trivial subgroup and the whole group are malnormal subgroups. A normal subgroup that is also malnormal must be one of these.4
Every malnormal subgroup is a special type of C-group called a trivial intersection subgroup or TI subgroup.

When G is finite, a malnormal subgroup H distinct from 1 and G is called a "Frobenius complement".5 The set N of elements of G which are, either equal to 1, or non-conjugate to any element of G, is a normal subgroup of G, called the "Frobenius kernel", and G is the semi-direct product of H and N (Frobenius' theorem).6
