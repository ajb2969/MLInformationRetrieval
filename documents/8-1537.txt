Second-order cone programming

A second-order cone program (SOCP) is a convex optimization problem of the form

minimize 
 
 

subject to
 
 
 







where the problem parameters are 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . Here 
 
 
 
  is the optimization variable. 1 When 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 , the SOCP reduces to a linear program. When 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 , the SOCP is equivalent to a convex quadratically constrained linear program. Quadratically constrained quadratic programs can also be formulated as SOCPs by reformulating the objective function as a constraint. Semidefinite programming subsumes SOCPs as the SOCP constraints can be written as linear matrix inequalities (LMI) and can be reformulated as an instance of semi definite program. SOCPs can be solved with great efficiency by interior point methods.
Example: Quadratic constraint
Consider a quadratic constraint of the form



This is equivalent to the SOC constraint



Example: Stochastic linear programming
Consider a stochastic linear program in inequality form

minimize 
 
 

subject to
 
 
 




where the parameters 
 
 
 
  are independent Gaussian random vectors with mean 
 
 
 
  and covariance 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . This problem can be expressed as the SOCP

minimize 
 
 

subject to
 
 
 




where 
 
 
 
  is the inverse normal cumulative distribution function.2
Example: Stochastic second-order cone programming
We refer to second-order cone programs as deterministic second-order cone programs since data deﬁning them are deterministic. Stochastic second-order cone programs3 is a class of optimization problems that deﬁned to handle uncertainty in data deﬁning deterministic second-order cone programs.
