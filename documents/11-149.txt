Carleman matrix

In mathematics, a Carleman matrix is a matrix used to convert function composition into matrix multiplication. It is often used in iteration theory to find the continuous iteration of functions which cannot be iterated by pattern recognition alone. Other uses of Carleman matrices occur in the theory of probability generating functions, and Markov chains.
Definition
The Carleman matrix of a function 
 
 
 
  is defined as:


 
  so as to satisfy the (Taylor series) equation:




For instance, the computation of 
 
 
 
  by


 
  simply amounts to the dot-product of row 1 of 
 
 
 
  with a column vector 
 
 
 
 .
The entries of 
 
 
 
  in the next row give the 2nd power of 
 
 
 
 :


 
  and also, in order to have the zero'th power of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , we aadopt the row 0 containing zeros everywhere except the first position, such that



Thus, the dot product of 
 
 
 
  with the column vector 
 
 
 
  yields the column vector 
 
 




Bell matrix
The Bell matrix of a function 
 
 
 
  is defined as


 
  so as to satisfy the equation


 
  so it is the transpose of the above Carleman matrix.
Jabotinsky matrix
Eri Jabotinsky developed that concept of matrices 1947 for the purpose of representation of convolutions of polynomials. In an article "Analytic Iteration" (1963) he introduces the term "representation matrix", and generalized that concept to two-way-infinite matrices. In that article only functions of the type 
 
 
 
  are discussed, but considered for positive *and* negative powers of the function. Several authors refer to the Bell matrices as "Jabotinsky matrix" since (D. Knuth 1992, W.D. Lang 2000), and possibly this shall grow to a more canonical name.

Generalization
A generalization of the Carleman matrix of a function can be defined around any point, such as:


 
  or 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 . This allows the matrix power to be related as:



Matrix properties
These matrices satisfy the fundamental relationships:








which makes the Carleman matrix M a (direct) representation of 
 
 
 
 , and the Bell matrix B an anti-representation of 
 
 
 
 . Here the term 
 
 
 
  denotes the composition of functions 
 
 
 
 .
Other properties include:



 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is an iterated function and


 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the inverse function (if the Carleman matrix is invertible).
