   Methanethiol oxidase      Methanethiol oxidase   In enzymology , a methanethiol oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   methanethiol + O 2 + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   formaldehyde + hydrogen sulfide + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are methanethiol , O 2 , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are formaldehyde , hydrogen sulfide , and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is methanethiol:oxygen oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include methylmercaptan oxidase , methyl mercaptan oxidase , (MM)-oxidase , and MT-oxidase .  References     "  Category:EC 1.8.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
