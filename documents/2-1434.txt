   Huge cardinal      Huge cardinal   In mathematics , a cardinal number κ is called huge if there exists an elementary embedding  j : V → M from V into a transitive inner model  M with critical point κ and        M     j   (  κ  )     ⊂  M   .       superscript  M    j  κ    M    {}^{j(\kappa)}M\subset M.\!     Here, α M is the class of all sequences of length α whose elements are in M.  Huge cardinals were introduced by .  Variants  In what follows, j n refers to the n -th iterate of the elementary embedding j, that is, j composed with itself n times, for a finite ordinal n . Also, <α M is the class of all sequences of length less than α whose elements are in M. Notice that for the "super" versions, γ should be less than j(κ), not     j  n    (  κ  )        superscript  j  n   κ    {j^{n}(\kappa)}   .  κ is almost n-huge if and only if there is j : V → M with critical point κ and        M      j  n    (  κ  )     ⊂  M   .       superscript  M     superscript  j  n   κ    M    {}^{j^{n}(\kappa)}M\subset M.\!     κ is super n-huge if and only if for every ordinal γ there is j : V → M with critical point κ, γ  $${}^{j^n(\kappa)}M \subset M.\!$$  Notice that 0-huge is the same as measurable cardinal ; and 1-huge is the same as huge. A cardinal satisfying one of the rank into rank axioms is n -huge for all finite n .  The existence of an almost huge cardinal implies that Vopěnka's principle is consistent; more precisely any almost huge cardinal is also a Vopěnka cardinal .  Consistency strength  The cardinals are arranged in order of increasing consistency strength as follows:   almost n -huge  super almost n -huge  n -huge  super n -huge  almost n +1-huge   The consistency of a huge cardinal implies the consistency of a supercompact cardinal , nevertheless, the least huge cardinal is smaller than the least supercompact cardinal (assuming both exist).  ω-huge cardinals  One can try defining an ω-huge cardinal κ as one such that an elementary embedding j : V → M from V into a transitive inner model M with critical point κ and λ M ⊆ M , where λ is the supremum of j n (κ) for positive integers n . However Kunen's inconsistency theorem shows that ω-huge cardinals are inconsistent in ZFC, though it is still open whether they are consistent in ZF.
