   Succinylglutamate desuccinylase      Succinylglutamate desuccinylase   In enzymology , a succinylglutamate desuccinylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-succinyl-L-glutamate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   succinate + L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-succinyl-L-glutamate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are succinate and L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-succinyl-L-glutamate amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include N2-succinylglutamate desuccinylase , SGDS , and AstE . This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism .  References         "  Category:EC 3.5.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
