   Unit cube      Unit cube   A unit cube , more formally a cube of side 1 , is a cube whose sides are 1 unit long. 1 2 The volume of a 3-dimensional unit cube is 1 cubic unit, and its total surface area is 6 square units. 3  Unit hypercube  The term unit cube or unit hypercube is also used for hypercubes , or "cubes" in n -dimensional spaces, for values of n other than 3 and edge length 1. 4 5  Sometimes the term "unit cube" refers in specific to the set [0, 1] n of all n -tuples of numbers in the interval [0, 1]. 6  The length of the longest diagonal of a unit hypercube of n dimensions is    n      n    \sqrt{n}   , the square root of n and the (Euclidean) length of the vector (1,1,1,....1,1) in n -dimensional space. 7  See also   K-cell  Robbins constant , the average distance between two random points in a unit cube  Tychonoff cube , an infinite-dimensional analogue of the unit cube  Unit square  Unit sphere   References  External links     "  Category:Euclidean solid geometry  Category:1 (number)  Category:Cubes     .
