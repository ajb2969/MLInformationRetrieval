Let X be a complete separable metric space and    ùîÖ   (  X  )       ùîÖ  X    \mathfrak{B}(X)   the œÉ-algebra of its Borel sets. A Borel measure Œº on X is boundedly finite if Œº(A) M_X be the space of all boundedly finite measures on    ùîÖ   (  X  )       ùîÖ  X    \mathfrak{B}(X)   . Let  be a probability space , then a random measure maps from this probability space to the measurable space . 1 A measure generally might be decomposed as:       Œº  =    Œº  d   +   Œº  a    =    Œº  d   +    ‚àë   n  =  1   N     Œ∫  n    Œ¥   X  n        ,        Œº     subscript  Œº  d    subscript  Œº  a            subscript  Œº  d     superscript   subscript     n  1    N      subscript  Œ∫  n    subscript  Œ¥   subscript  X  n          \mu=\mu_{d}+\mu_{a}=\mu_{d}+\sum_{n=1}^{N}\kappa_{n}\delta_{X_{n}},     Here    Œº  d     subscript  Œº  d    \mu_{d}   is a diffuse measure without atoms, while    Œº  a     subscript  Œº  a    \mu_{a}   is a purely atomic measure.  Random counting measure  A random measure of the form:       Œº  =    ‚àë   n  =  1   N    Œ¥   X  n      ,      Œº    superscript   subscript     n  1    N    subscript  Œ¥   subscript  X  n       \mu=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\delta_{X_{n}},     where   Œ¥   Œ¥   \delta   is the Dirac measure , and    X  n     subscript  X  n    X_{n}   are random variables, is called a point process 2 3 or random counting measure . This random measure describes the set of N particles, whose locations are given by the (generally vector valued) random variables    X  n     subscript  X  n    X_{n}   . The diffuse component    Œº  d     subscript  Œº  d    \mu_{d}   is null for a counting measure.  In the formal notation of above a random counting measure is a map from a probability space to the measurable space  a measurable space . Here    N  X     subscript  N  X    N_{X}   is the space of all boundedly finite integer-valued measures    N  ‚àà   M  X       N   subscript  M  X     N\in M_{X}   (called counting measures).  The definitions of expectation measure, Laplace functional, moment measures and stationarity for random measures follow those of point processes . Random measures are useful in the description and analysis of Monte Carlo methods , such as Monte Carlo numerical quadrature and particle filters . 4  See also   Point process  Poisson random measure  Random element  Vector measure  Ensemble  Probability measure   References    "  Category:Measures (measure theory)  Category:Stochastic processes     ‚Ü©    Crisan, D., Particle Filters: A Theoretical Perspective , in Sequential Monte Carlo in Practice, Doucet, A., de Freitas, N. and Gordon, N.
