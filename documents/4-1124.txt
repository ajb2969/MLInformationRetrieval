   Karoubi envelope      Karoubi envelope   In mathematics the Karoubi envelope (or Cauchy completion or idempotent completion ) of a category  C is a classification of the idempotents of C , by means of an auxiliary category. Taking the Karoubi envelope of a preadditive category gives a pseudo-abelian category , hence the construction is sometimes called the pseudo-abelian completion. It is named for the French mathematician Max Karoubi .  Given a category C , an idempotent of C is an endomorphism      e  :   A  ‚Üí  A      normal-:  e   normal-‚Üí  A  A     e:A\rightarrow A     with       e  ‚àò  e   =  e        e  e   e    e\circ e=e   .  An idempotent e : A ‚Üí A is said to split if there is an object B and morphisms f : A ‚Üí B , g : B ‚Üí A such that e = g  f and 1 B = f  g .  The Karoubi envelope of C , sometimes written Split(C) , is the category whose objects are pairs of the form ( A , e ) where A is an object of C and    e  :   A  ‚Üí  A      normal-:  e   normal-‚Üí  A  A     e:A\rightarrow A   is an idempotent of C , and whose morphisms are the triples       (  e  ,  f  ,   e  ‚Ä≤   )   :    (  A  ,  e  )   ‚Üí   (   A  ‚Ä≤   ,   e  ‚Ä≤   )       normal-:   e  f   superscript  e  normal-‚Ä≤     normal-‚Üí   A  e     superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤    superscript  e  normal-‚Ä≤       (e,f,e^{\prime}):(A,e)\rightarrow(A^{\prime},e^{\prime})     where    f  :   A  ‚Üí   A  ‚Ä≤       normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  A   superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤      f:A\rightarrow A^{\prime}   is a morphism of C satisfying      e  ‚Ä≤   ‚àò  f   =  f  =   f  ‚àò  e            superscript  e  normal-‚Ä≤   f   f         f  e      e^{\prime}\circ f=f=f\circ e   (or equivalently    f  =    e  ‚Ä≤   ‚àò  f  ‚àò  e       f     superscript  e  normal-‚Ä≤   f  e     f=e^{\prime}\circ f\circ e   ).  Composition in Split(C) is as in C , but the identity morphism on    (  A  ,  e  )     A  e    (A,e)   in Split(C) is    (  e  ,  e  ,  e  )     e  e  e    (e,e,e)   , rather than the identity on   A   A   A   .  The category C embeds fully and faithfully in Split(C) . In Split(C) every idempotent splits, and Split(C) is the universal category with this property. The Karoubi envelope of a category C can therefore be considered as the "completion" of C which splits idempotents.  The Karoubi envelope of a category C can equivalently be defined as the full subcategory of    ùêÇ  ^     normal-^  ùêÇ    \hat{\mathbf{C}}   (the presheaves over C ) of retracts of representable functors . The category of presheaves on C is equivalent to the category of presheaves on Split(C) .  Automorphisms in the Karoubi envelope  An automorphism in Split(C) is of the form     (  e  ,  f  ,  e  )   :    (  A  ,  e  )   ‚Üí   (  A  ,  e  )       normal-:   e  f  e    normal-‚Üí   A  e    A  e      (e,f,e):(A,e)\rightarrow(A,e)   , with inverse     (  e  ,  g  ,  e  )   :    (  A  ,  e  )   ‚Üí   (  A  ,  e  )       normal-:   e  g  e    normal-‚Üí   A  e    A  e      (e,g,e):(A,e)\rightarrow(A,e)   satisfying:       g  ‚àò  f   =  e  =   f  ‚àò  g           g  f   e         f  g      g\circ f=e=f\circ g          g  ‚àò  f  ‚àò  g   =  g        g  f  g   g    g\circ f\circ g=g          f  ‚àò  g  ‚àò  f   =  f        f  g  f   f    f\circ g\circ f=f     If the first equation is relaxed to just have     g  ‚àò  f   =   f  ‚àò  g         g  f     f  g     g\circ f=f\circ g   , then f is a partial automorphism (with inverse g ). A (partial) involution in Split(C) is a self-inverse (partial) automorphism.  Examples   If C has products, then given an isomorphism     f  :   A  ‚Üí  B      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  A  B     f:A\rightarrow B   the mapping     f  √ó   f   -  1     :    A  √ó  B   ‚Üí   B  √ó  A       normal-:    f   superscript  f    1      normal-‚Üí    A  B     B  A      f\times f^{-1}:A\times B\rightarrow B\times A   , composed with the canonical map    Œ≥  :    B  √ó  A   ‚Üí   A  √ó  B       normal-:  Œ≥   normal-‚Üí    B  A     A  B      \gamma:B\times A\rightarrow A\times B   of symmetry, is a partial involution .  If C is a triangulated category , the Karoubi envelope Split ( C ) can be endowed with the structure of a triangulated category such that the canonical functor C ‚Üí Split ( C ) becomes a triangulated functor . 1  The Karoubi envelope is used in the construction of several categories of motives .  The Karoubi envelope construction takes semi-adjunctions to adjunctions . 2 For this reason the Karoubi envelope is used in the study of models of the untyped lambda calculus . The Karoubi envelope of an extensional lambda model (a monoid, considered as a category) is cartesian closed. 3    References       "  Category:Category theory     ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©
