Phosphoserine transaminase

Phosphoserine transaminase (, PSAT, phosphoserine aminotransferase, 3-phosphoserine aminotransferase, hydroxypyruvic phosphate-glutamic transaminase, L-phosphoserine aminotransferase, phosphohydroxypyruvate transaminase, phosphohydroxypyruvic-glutamic transaminase, 3-O-phospho-L-serine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, SerC, PdxC, 3PHP transaminase) is an enzyme with system name O-phospho-L-serine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase.12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) O-phospho-L-serine + 2-oxoglutarate

 
  3-phosphonooxypyruvate + L-glutamate

(2) 4-phosphonooxy-L-threonine + 2-oxoglutarate 
 
 
 
  (3R)-3-hydroxy-2-oxo-4-phosphonooxybutanoate + L-glutamate
 

This enzyme is a pyridoxal-phosphate protein.
