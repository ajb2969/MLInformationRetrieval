Four-tensor

Four-tensor is a frequent abbreviation for a tensor in a four-dimensional spacetime.1
Syntax
General four-tensors are usually written as 
 
 
 
 , with the indices taking integral values from 0 to 3. Such a tensor is said to have contravariant rank n and covariant rank m.2
Examples
One of the simplest non-trivial examples of a four-tensor is the four-displacement 
 
 
 
 , a four-tensor with contravariant rank 1 and covariant rank 0. Four-tensors of this kind are usually known as four-vectors. Here the component 
 
 
 
  gives the displacement of a body in time (time is multiplied by the speed of light 
 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
  has dimensions of length). The remaining components of the four-displacement form the spatial displacement vector

Similarly, the four-momentum

 
  of a body is equivalent to the energy-momentum tensor of said body. The element 
 
 
 
  represents the momentum of the body as a result of it travelling through time (directly comparable to the internal energy of the body). The elements 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  correspond to the momentum of the body as a result of it travelling through space, written in vector notation as 
 
 
 
 .4
The electromagnetic field tensor is an example of a rank two contravariant tensor:5
