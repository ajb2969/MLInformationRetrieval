   Urea carboxylase      Urea carboxylase   In enzymology , an urea carboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + urea + HCO 3 -   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + urea-1-carboxylate   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , urea , and HCO3- , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and urea-1-carboxylate (allophanate).  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming generic carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is urea:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming) . Other names in common use include urease (ATP-hydrolysing) , urea carboxylase (hydrolysing) , ATP-urea amidolyase , urea amidolyase , UALase , and UCA . This enzyme participates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups . It employs one cofactor , biotin .
