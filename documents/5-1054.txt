Hydraulic retention time

The hydraulic retention time (HRT), also known as hydraulic residence time or t (tau), is a measure of the average length of time that a soluble compound remains in a constructed bioreactor.
Hydraulic retention time is the volume of the aeration tank divided by the influent flowrate:



where using SI Units Volume is in [m3] and Influent flowrate is in [m3/h]. HRT is usually expressed in hours (or sometimes days).
