   Hydraulic retention time      Hydraulic retention time   The hydraulic retention time ( HRT ), also known as hydraulic residence time or t (tau), is a measure of the average length of time that a soluble compound remains in a constructed bioreactor .  Hydraulic retention time is the volume of the aeration tank divided by the influent flowrate :       H  R  T   =    V  o  l  u  m   e   o   f   a  e  r  a  t  i  o   n   t  a  n  k    i  n  f  l  u  e  n   t   f  l  o  w  r  a  t  e          H  R  T       V  o  l  u  m  e  o  f  a  e  r  a  t  i  o  n  t  a  n  k     i  n  f  l  u  e  n  t  f  l  o  w  r  a  t  e      HRT=\frac{Volume\;of\;aeration\;tank}{influent\;flowrate}     where using SI Units  Volume is in [m 3 ] and Influent flowrate is in [m 3 /h]. HRT is usually expressed in hours (or sometimes days).
