Zakharov–Schulman system

In mathematics, the Zakharov–Schulman system is a system of nonlinear partial differential equations introduced in  to describe the interactions of small amplitude, high frequency waves with acoustic waves. The equations are





 
  where L1, L2, and L3, are constant coefficient differential operators.
