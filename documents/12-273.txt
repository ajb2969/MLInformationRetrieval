   Zakharov–Schulman system      Zakharov–Schulman system   In mathematics, the Zakharov–Schulman system is a system of nonlinear partial differential equations introduced in  to describe the interactions of small amplitude, high frequency waves with acoustic waves . The equations are        i    ∂  t   u    +    L  1   u    =   ϕ  u           i    subscript   t   u       subscript  L  1   u      ϕ  u     i\partial_{t}u+L_{1}u=\phi u           L  2   ϕ   =    L  3    (    |  u  |   2   )           subscript  L  2   ϕ      subscript  L  3    superscript    u   2      L_{2}\phi=L_{3}(|u|^{2})   where L 1 , L 2 , and L 3 , are constant coefficient differential operators .
