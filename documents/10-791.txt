   Luteolin O-methyltransferase      Luteolin O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a luteolin O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3'-methoxyflavone   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone (luteolin), whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3'-methoxyflavone .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone 3'-O-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include o-dihydric phenol methyltransferase , luteolin methyltransferase , luteolin 3'-O-methyltransferase , o-diphenol m-O-methyltransferase , o-dihydric phenol meta-O-methyltransferase , and S-adenosylmethionine:flavone/flavonol 3'-O-methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in flavonoid biosynthesis .  References     "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure  Category:O-Methylated flavones metabolism
