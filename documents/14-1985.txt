Bipolar theorem

In mathematics, the bipolar theorem is a theorem in convex analysis which provides necessary and sufficient conditions for a cone to be equal to its bipolar. The bipolar theorem can be seen as a special case of the Fenchel–Moreau theorem.1
Statement of theorem
For any nonempty set

 
  in some linear space

 
 , then the bipolar cone 
 
 
 
  is given by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes the convex hull.23
Special case


 
  is a nonempty closed convex cone if and only if 
 
 
 
  when 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the positive dual cone.45
Or more generally, if 
 
 
 
  is a convex cone then the bipolar cone is given by



Relation to Fenchel–Moreau theorem
If 
 
 
 
  is the indicator function for a cone 
 
 
 
 . Then the convex conjugate

 
  is the support function for 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . Therefore 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 .67
