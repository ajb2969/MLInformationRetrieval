En-ring

 In mathematics, an 

 
 -algebra in a symmetric monoidal infinity category C consists of the following data:

An object 
 
 
 
  for any open subset U of Rn homeomorphic to an n-disk.
A multiplication map:
 
 




for any disjoint open disks 
 
 
 
 
  contained in some open disk V


subject to the requirements that the multiplication maps are compatible with composition, and that 
 
 
 
  is an equivalence if 
 
 
 
 . An equivalent definition is that A is an algebra in C over the little n-disks operad.
Examples

An 
 
 
 
 -algebra in vector spaces over a field is a unital associative algebra if n=1, and a unital commutative associative algebra if n≥2.


An 
 
 
 
 -algebra in categories is a monoidal category if n=1, a braided monoidal category if n=2, and a symmetric monoidal category if n≥3.


If Λ is a commutative ring, then 
 
 
 
 
  defines an 
 
 
 
 -algebra in the infinity category of chain complexes of 
 
 
 
 -modules.
