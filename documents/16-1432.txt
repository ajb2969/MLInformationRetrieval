Draft:Ringed topos

In mathematics, a ringed topos is a generalization of a ringed space; that is, the notion is obtained by replacing a "topological space" by a "topos". The definition of a topos-version of a "locally ringed space" is not straightforward (as the notion of "local" in this context is not obvious.)
The notion of a ringed topos has applications to deformation theory in algebraic geometry (cf. cotangent complex) and the mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics (see for example Bohr topos).1
Morphism
A morphism 
 
 
 
  of ringed topoi is a pair consisting of a topos morphism 
 
 
 
  and a ring homomorphism 
 
 
 
 .
If one replaces a "topos" by an ∞-topos, then one gets the notion of a ringed ∞-topos.
Sheaf of En-rings
Let O be the sheaf of En-rings. Then for any O-algebra R we let
