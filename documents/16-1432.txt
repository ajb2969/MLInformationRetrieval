   Draft:Ringed topos      Draft:Ringed topos   In mathematics, a ringed topos is a generalization of a ringed space ; that is, the notion is obtained by replacing a " topological space " by a " topos ". The definition of a topos-version of a "locally ringed space" is not straightforward (as the notion of "local" in this context is not obvious.)  The notion of a ringed topos has applications to deformation theory in algebraic geometry (cf. cotangent complex ) and the mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics (see for example Bohr topos ). 1  Morphism  A morphism     (  T  ,   𝒪  T   )   →   (   T  ′   ,   𝒪   T  ′    )      normal-→   T   subscript  𝒪  T      superscript  T  normal-′    subscript  𝒪   superscript  T  normal-′       (T,\mathcal{O}_{T})\to(T^{\prime},\mathcal{O}_{T^{\prime}})   of ringed topoi is a pair consisting of a topos morphism    f  :   T  →   T  ′       normal-:  f   normal-→  T   superscript  T  normal-′      f:T\to T^{\prime}   and a ring homomorphism     𝒪   T  ′    →    f  *    𝒪  T       normal-→   subscript  𝒪   superscript  T  normal-′       subscript  f     subscript  𝒪  T      \mathcal{O}_{T^{\prime}}\to f_{*}\mathcal{O}_{T}   .  If one replaces a "topos" by an ∞-topos , then one gets the notion of a ringed ∞-topos .  Sheaf of E n -rings  Let O be the sheaf of E n -rings. Then for any O -algebra R we let     Spec  R   =    Map   O  -  alg     (  R  ,  -  )         Spec  R     subscript  Map    O  alg    R      \operatorname{Spec}R=\operatorname{Map}_{O-\text{alg}}(R,-)     Notes  References   The standard reference is SGA IV.
