   Poincaré separation theorem      Poincaré separation theorem   In mathematics , the Poincaré separation theorem gives the upper and lower bounds of eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix  B'AB that can be considered as the orthogonal projection of a larger real symmetric matrix A onto a linear subspace spanned by the columns of B . The theorem is named after Henri Poincaré .  More specifically, let A be an n × n real symmetric matrix and B an n × r  semi-orthogonal matrix such that B'B = I r . Denote by    λ  i     subscript  λ  i    \lambda_{i}   , i = 1, 2, ..., n and    μ  i     subscript  μ  i    \mu_{i}   , i = 1, 2, ..., r the eigenvalues of A and B'AB , respectively (in descending order). We have        λ  i   ≥   μ  i   ≥   λ    n  -  r   +  i     ,         subscript  λ  i    subscript  μ  i         subscript  λ      n  r   i       \lambda_{i}\geq\mu_{i}\geq\lambda_{n-r+i},     Proof  An algebraic proof, based on the variational interpretation of eigenvalues , has been published in Magnus' Matrix Differential Calculus with Applications in Statistics and Econometrics . 1 From the geometric point of view, B'AB can be considered as the orthogonal projection of A onto the linear subspace spanned by B , so the above results follow immediately. 2  References  Further reading  "  Category:Inequalities  Category:Matrix theory     ↩  ↩
