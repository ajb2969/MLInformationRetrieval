Felici's law

In physics, Felici's law allows one to calculate the net charge through a circuit configuration in which there is a current induced by a variable magnetic field, such a conductor coil immersed in a variable magnetic field. This law makes it possible to calculate net charge in a period using initial flux and final flux.
