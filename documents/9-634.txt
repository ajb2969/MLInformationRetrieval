   Vapor quality      Vapor quality   In thermodynamics , vapor quality is the mass fraction in a saturated mixture that is vapour ; 1 i.e. saturated vapour has a "quality" of 100%, and saturated liquid has a "quality" of 0%. Vapour quality is an intensive property which can be used in conjunction with other independent intensive properties to specify the thermodynamic state of the working fluid of a thermodynamic system . It has no meaning for substances which are not saturated mixtures (i.e., compressed liquids or superheated fluids).  Quality   χ   χ   \chi   can be calculated by dividing the mass of the vapor by the mass of the total mixture:      χ  =    m   v  a  p  o  r     m   t  o  t  a  l         χ     subscript  m    v  a  p  o  r     subscript  m    t  o  t  a  l       \chi=\frac{m_{vapor}}{m_{total}}   where   m   m   m   indicates mass.  Another definition used by chemical engineers defines quality (q) of a fluid as the fraction that is saturated liquid. 2 By this definition, a saturated liquid has q = 0. A saturated vapor has q = 1. 3  Calculation  The above expression for vapor quality can be expressed as:      χ  =    y  -   y  f      y  g   -   y  f         χ      y   subscript  y  f       subscript  y  g    subscript  y  f       \chi=\frac{y-y_{f}}{y_{g}-y_{f}}   , where   y   y   y   is equal to either specific enthalpy , specific entropy , specific volume or specific internal energy ,    y  f     subscript  y  f    y_{f}   is the value of the specific property of saturated liquid state and     y  g   -   y  f        subscript  y  g    subscript  y  f     y_{g}-y_{f}   is the value of the specific property of the substance in dome zone, which we can find both liquid    y  f     subscript  y  f    y_{f}   and vapor    y  g     subscript  y  g    y_{g}   .  Another expression of the same concept is:      χ  =    m  v     m  l   +   m  v         χ     subscript  m  v      subscript  m  l    subscript  m  v       \chi=\frac{m_{v}}{m_{l}+m_{v}}   where    m  v     subscript  m  v    m_{v}   is the vapor mass and    m  l     subscript  m  l    m_{l}   is the liquid mass.  Steam quality  The genesis of the idea of vapor quality was derived from the origins of thermodynamics , where an important application was the steam engine. Low quality steam would contain a high moisture percentage and therefore damage components more easily. High quality steam would not corrode the steam engine. Steam engines use water vapor ( steam ) to drive pistons or turbines which create work. The quality of steam can be quantitatively described by steam quality (steam dryness), the proportion of saturated steam in a saturated water/steam mixture. I.e., a steam quality of 0 indicates 100% water while a steam quality of 1 (or 100%) indicates 100% steam.  The quality of steam on which steam whistles are blown is variable and may affect frequency . Steam quality determines the velocity of sound , which declines with decreasing dryness due to the inertia of the liquid phase . Also, the specific volume of steam for a given temperature decreases with decreasing dryness. 4 5  Steam quality is very useful in determining enthalpy of saturated water/steam mixtures since the enthalpy of steam (gaseous state) is many orders of magnitude higher than enthalpy of water (liquid state).
