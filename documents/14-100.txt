Bending of plates




Bending of plates

 Bending of plates or plate bending refers to the deflection of a plate perpendicular to the plane of the plate under the action of external forces and moments. The amount of deflection can be determined by solving the differential equations of an appropriate plate theory. The stresses in the plate can be calculated from these deflections. Once the stresses are known, failure theories can be used to determine whether a plate will fail under a given load.

  The quantity 
 
 
 
  has units of force per unit length. The quantity 
 
 
 
  has units of moment per unit length.
For isotropic, homogeneous, plates with Young's modulus

 
  and Poisson's ratio

 
  these equations reduce to2


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the deflection of the mid-surface of the plate.
In rectangular Cartesian coordinates,



Circular Kirchhoff-Love plates
The bending of circular plates can be examined by solving the governing equation with appropriate boundary conditions. These solutions were first found by Poisson in 1829. Cylindrical coordinates are convenient for such problems.
The governing equation in coordinate-free form is


 
  In cylindrical coordinates 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  For symmetrically loaded circular plates, 
 
 
 
 , and we have


 
  Therefore, the governing equation is


 
  If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are constant, direct integration of the governing equation gives us





where 
 
 
 
  are constants. The slope of the deflection surface is


 
  For a circular plate, the requirement that the deflection and the slope of the deflection are finite at 
 
 
 
  implies that 
 
 
 
 .
Clamped edges
For a circular plate with clamped edges, we have 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  at the edge of the plate (radius 
 
 
 
 ). Using these boundary conditions we get





The in-plane displacements in the plate are


 
  The in-plane strains in the plate are


 
  The in-plane stresses in the plate are


 
  For a plate of thickness 
 
 
 
 , the bending stiffness is 
 
 
 
  and we have





The moment resultants (bending moments) are


 
  The maximum radial stress is at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 :


 
  where 
 
 
 
 . The bending moments at the boundary and the center of the plate are



Rectangular Kirchhoff-Love plates
thumb | 250px | Bending of a rectangular plate under the action of a distributed force 
 
 
 
  per unit area. For rectangular plates, Navier in 1820 introduced a simple method for finding the displacement and stress when a plate is simply supported. The idea was to express the applied load in terms of Fourier components, find the solution for a sinusoidal load (a single Fourier component), and then superimpose the Fourier components to get the solution for an arbitrary load.
Sinusoidal load
Let us assume that the load is of the form


 
  Here 
 
 
 
  is the amplitude, 
 
 
 
  is the width of the plate in the 
 
 
 
 -direction, and 
 
 
 
  is the width of the plate in the 
 
 
 
 -direction.
Since the plate is simply supported, the displacement 
 
 
 
  along the edges of the plate is zero, the bending moment 
 
 
 
  is zero at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is zero at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
If we apply these boundary conditions and solve the plate equation, we get the solution


 
  Where D is the flexural rigidity


 
  Analogous to flexural stiffness EI.3 We can calculate the stresses and strains in the plate once we know the displacement.
For a more general load of the form


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are integers, we get the solution





Navier solution
Let us now consider a more general load 
 
 
 
 . We can break this load up into a sum of Fourier components such that


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is an amplitude. We can use the orthogonality of Fourier components,


 
  to find the amplitudes 
 
 
 
 . Thus we have, by integrating over 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  If we repeat the process by integrating over 
 
 
 
 , we have


 
  Therefore,


 
  Now that we know 
 
 
 
 , we can just superpose solutions of the form given in equation (1) to get the displacement, i.e.,





Uniform load
Consider the situation where a uniform load is applied on the plate, i.e., 
 
 
 
 . Then


 
  Now


 
  We can use these relations to get a simpler expression for 
 
 
 
 :


 
  Since 
 
 
 
  [ so 
 
 
 
  ] when 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are even, we can get an even simpler expression for 
 
 
 
  when both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are odd:


 
  Plugging this expression into equation (2) and keeping in mind that only odd terms contribute to the displacement, we have





The corresponding moments are given by


 
 
  The stresses in the plate are







Levy solution
Another approach was proposed by Levy in 1899. In this case we start with an assumed form of the displacement and try to fit the parameters so that the governing equation and the boundary conditions are satisfied.
Let us assume that


 
  For a plate that is simply supported at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the boundary conditions are 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The moment boundary condition is equivalent to 
 
 
 
  (verify). The goal is to find 
 
 
 
  such that it satisfies the boundary conditions at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and, of course, the governing equation 
 
 
 
 .
Moments along edges
Let us consider the case of pure moment loading. In that case 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  has to satisfy 
 
 
 
 . Since we are working in rectangular Cartesian coordinates, the governing equation can be expanded as


 
  Plugging the expression for 
 
 
 
  in the governing equation gives us


 
  or


 
  This is an ordinary differential equation which has the general solution


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are constants that can be determined from the boundary conditions. Therefore the displacement solution has the form





Let us choose the coordinate system such that the boundaries of the plate are at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (same as before) and at 
 
 
 
  (and not 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ). Then the moment boundary conditions at the 
 
 
 
  boundaries are


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are known functions. The solution can be found by applying these boundary conditions. We can show that for the symmetrical case where


 
  and


 
  we have





where


 
  Similarly, for the antisymmetrical case where


 
  we have





We can superpose the symmetric and antisymmetric solutions to get more general solutions.
Uniform and symmetric moment load
For the special case where the loading is symmetric and the moment is uniform, we have at 
 
 
 
 ,







The resulting displacement is





where


 
  The bending moments and shear forces corresponding to the displacement 
 
 
 
  are


 
 
  The stresses are



Cylindrical plate bending
Cylindrical bending occurs when a rectangular plate that has dimensions 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and the thickness 
 
 
 
  is small, is subjected to a uniform distributed load perpendicular to the plane of the plate. Such a plate takes the shape of the surface of a cylinder.
Simply supported plate with axially fixed ends
For a simply supported plate under cylindrical bending with edges that are free to rotate but have a fixed 
 
 
 
 . Cylindrical bending solutions can be found using the Navier and Levy techniques.
Bending of thick Mindlin plates
For thick plates, we have to consider the effect of through-the-thickness shears on the orientation of the normal to the mid-surface after deformation. Mindlin's theory provides one approach for find the deformation and stresses in such plates. Solutions to Mindlin's theory can be derived from the equivalent Kirchhoff-Love solutions using canonical relations.4
Governing equations
The canonical governing equation for isotropic thick plates can be expressed as5


 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is the applied transverse load, 
 
 
 
  is the shear modulus, 
 
 
 
  is the bending rigidity, 
 
 
 
  is the plate thickness, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  is the shear correction factor, 
 
 
 
  is the Young's modulus, 
 
 
 
  is the Poisson's ratio, and


 
  In Mindlin's theory, 
 
 
 
  is the transverse displacement of the mid-surface of the plate and the quantities 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the rotations of the mid-surface normal about the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 -axes, respectively. The canonical parameters for this theory are 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The shear correction factor 
 
 
 
  usually has the value 
 
 
 
 .
The solutions to the governing equations can be found if one knows the corresponding Kirchhoff-Love solutions by using the relations


 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the displacement predicted for a Kirchhoff-Love plate, 
 
 
 
  is a biharmonic function such that 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a function that satisfies the Laplace equation, 
 
 
 
 , and



Simply supported rectangular plates
For simply supported plates, the Marcus moment sum vanishes, i.e.,


 
  In that case the functions 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  vanish, and the Mindlin solution is related to the corresponding Kirchhoff solution by



Bending of Reissner-Stein cantilever plates
Reissner-Stein theory for cantilever plates6 leads to the following coupled ordinary differential equations for a cantilever plate with concentrated end load 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 .


 
 
  and the boundary conditions at 
 
 
 
  are


 
 
  Solution of this system of two ODEs gives


 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 . The bending moments and shear forces corresponding to the displacement 
 
 
 
  are


 
 
  The stresses are


 
  If the applied load at the edge is constant, we recover the solutions for a beam under a concentrated end load. If the applied load is a linear function of 
 
 
 
 , then
