   Glutarate—CoA ligase      Glutarate—CoA ligase   In enzymology , a glutarate-CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + glutarate + CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + glutaryl-CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , glutarate , and CoA , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and glutaryl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glutarate:CoA ligase (ADP-forming) . Other names in common use include glutaryl-CoA synthetase , and glutaryl coenzyme A synthetase . This enzyme participates in fatty acid metabolism and lysine degradation .
