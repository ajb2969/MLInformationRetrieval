   Principal part      Principal part   In mathematics , the principal part has several independent meanings, but usually refers to the negative-power portion of the Laurent series of a function.  Laurent series definition  The principal part at    z  =  a      z  a    z=a   of a function       f   (  z  )    =    ∑   k  =   -  ∞    ∞     a  k     (   z  -  a   )   k           f  z     superscript   subscript     k             subscript  a  k    superscript    z  a   k       f(z)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}a_{k}(z-a)^{k}   is the portion of the Laurent series consisting of terms with negative degree. That is,       ∑   k  =   -  ∞     -  1      a  k     (   z  -  a   )   k        superscript   subscript     k          1       subscript  a  k    superscript    z  a   k      \sum_{k=-\infty}^{-1}a_{k}(z-a)^{k}   is the principal part of   f   f   f   at   a   a   a   .    f   (  z  )       f  z    f(z)   has an essential singularity at   a   a   a   , if and only if the principal part is an infinite sum.  Other definitions  Calculus  Consider the difference between the function differential and the actual increment:        Δ  y    Δ  x    =     f  ′    (  x  )    +  ε           normal-Δ  y     normal-Δ  x         superscript  f  normal-′   x   ε     \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=f^{\prime}(x)+\varepsilon          Δ  y   =     f  ′    (  x  )   Δ  x   +   ε  Δ  x    =    d  y   +   ε  Δ  x            normal-Δ  y        superscript  f  normal-′   x  normal-Δ  x     ε  normal-Δ  x             d  y     ε  normal-Δ  x       \Delta y=f^{\prime}(x)\Delta x+\varepsilon\Delta x=dy+\varepsilon\Delta x   The differential dy is sometimes called the principal (linear) part of the function increment Δy .  Distribution theory  The term principal part is also used for certain kinds of distributions having a singular support at a single point.
