Principal part

In mathematics, the principal part has several independent meanings, but usually refers to the negative-power portion of the Laurent series of a function.
Laurent series definition
The principal part at 
 
 
 
  of a function


 
  is the portion of the Laurent series consisting of terms with negative degree. That is,


 
  is the principal part of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  has an essential singularity at 
 
 
 
 , if and only if the principal part is an infinite sum.
Other definitions
Calculus
Consider the difference between the function differential and the actual increment:





 
  The differential dy is sometimes called the principal (linear) part of the function increment Î”y.
Distribution theory
The term principal part is also used for certain kinds of distributions having a singular support at a single point.
