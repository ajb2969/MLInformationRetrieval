   Einstein force      Einstein force   The Einstein force is an apparent force which acts in an accelerated reference system.  Suppose that there are two reference frames S and S ', where S ' is moving relative to S . The origin of S ' moves along some curve in S , which can be traced out by some vector C which is a function of t . The Einstein force is the apparent force acting on a particle of mass  m in the S ' frame, and is defined by       𝐅  =   -   m     d  2   𝐂    d   t  2        .
