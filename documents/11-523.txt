   Oleoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) hydrolase      Oleoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) hydrolase   In enzymology , an oleoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   oleoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   [acyl-carrier-protein] + oleate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are oleoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein ] and H 2 O , whereas its two products are acyl-carrier-protein and oleate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is oleoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydrolase . Other names in common use include acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydrolase , acyl-ACP-hydrolase , acyl-acyl carrier protein hydrolase , oleoyl-ACP thioesterase , and oleoyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterase . This enzyme participates in fatty acid biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
