   Torelli theorem      Torelli theorem  In [[mathematics] ], the Torelli theorem , named after Ruggiero Torelli , is a classical result of algebraic geometry over the complex number field , stating that a non-singular projective algebraic curve ( compact Riemann surface ) C is determined by its Jacobian variety  J ( C ), when the latter is given in the form of a principally polarized abelian variety . In other words, the complex torus  J ( C ), with certain 'markings', is enough to recover C . The same statement holds over any algebraically closed field . 1 From more precise information on the constructed isomorphism of the curves it follows that if the canonically principally polarized Jacobian varieties of curves of genus     ≥  2      absent  2    \geq 2   are k -isomorphic for k any perfect field , so are the curves. 2  This result has had many important extensions. It can be recast to read that a certain natural morphism , the period mapping , from the moduli space of curves of a fixed genus , to a moduli space of abelian varieties , is injective (on geometric points ). Generalizations are in two directions. Firstly, to geometric questions about that morphism, for example the local Torelli theorem . Secondly, to other period mappings. A case that has been investigated deeply is for K3 surfaces .
