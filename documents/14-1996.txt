   Benson's algorithm      Benson's algorithm   Benson's algorithm , named after Harold Benson , is a method for solving linear  multi-objective optimization problems. This works by finding the "efficient extreme points in the outcome set". 1 The primary concept in Benson's algorithm is to evaluate the upper image of the vector optimization problem by cutting planes . 2  Idea of algorithm  Consider a vector linear program        min  C    P   x   subject to  A  x    ≥  b        subscript   C     P  x  subject to  A  x    b    \min_{C}Px\;\text{ subject to }Ax\geq b   for    P  ∈   ℝ   q  ×  n        P   superscript  ℝ    q  n      P\in\mathbb{R}^{q\times n}   ,    A  ∈   ℝ   m  ×  n        A   superscript  ℝ    m  n      A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}   ,    b  ∈   ℝ  m       b   superscript  ℝ  m     b\in\mathbb{R}^{m}   and a polyhedral convex ordering cone   C   C   C   having nonempty interior and containing no lines. The feasible set is    S  =   {   x  ∈   ℝ  n    :    A  x   ≥  b   }       S   conditional-set    x   superscript  ℝ  n        A  x   b      S=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}:\;Ax\geq b\}   . In particular, Benson's algorithm finds the extreme points of the set     P   [  S  ]    +  C        P   delimited-[]  S    C    P[S]+C   , which is called upper image. 3  In case of    C  =   ℝ  +  q   :=   {   y  ∈   ℝ  q    :     y  1   ≥   0  ,  …    ,    y  q   ≥  0    }         C   subscript   superscript  ℝ  q       assign     conditional-set    y   superscript  ℝ  q     formulae-sequence     subscript  y  1    0  normal-…       subscript  y  q   0        C=\mathbb{R}^{q}_{+}:=\{y\in\mathbb{R}^{q}:y_{1}\geq 0,\dots,y_{q}\geq 0\}   , one obtains the special case of a multi-objective linear program ( multiobjective optimization ).
