Deoxyguanosine kinase

In enzymology, a deoxyguanosine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + deoxyguanosine 
 
 
 
  ADP + dGMP
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and deoxyguanosine, whereas its two products are ADP and dGMP.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:deoxyguanosine 5'-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include deoxyguanosine kinase (phosphorylating), (dihydroxypropoxymethyl)guanine kinase, 2'-deoxyguanosine kinase, and NTP-deoxyguanosine 5'-phosphotransferase. This enzyme participates in purine metabolism.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
Clinical
Mutations in this gene have been linked to inherited mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes, neonatal liver failure, nystagmus and hypotonia.
