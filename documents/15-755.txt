   Vague set      Vague set   In mathematics, vague sets are an extension of fuzzy sets . In a fuzzy set, each object is assigned a single value in the interval [0,1] reflecting its grade of membership . Unfortunately, this single value does not allow a separation of evidence for membership and evidence against membership. Gau et al. 1 proposed the notion of vague sets, where each object is characterized by two different membership functions: a true membership function and a false membership function. This kind of reasoning is also called interval membership, as opposed to point membership in the context of fuzzy sets.  Mathematical definition  A vague set   V   V   V   is characterized by   its true membership function     t  v    (  x  )        subscript  t  v   x    t_{v}(x)     its false membership function     f  v    (  x  )        subscript  f  v   x    f_{v}(x)     with    0  ≤     t  v    (  x  )    +    f  v    (  x  )     ≤  1        0       subscript  t  v   x      subscript  f  v   x         1     0\leq t_{v}(x)+f_{v}(x)\leq 1      The grade of membership for x is not a crisp value anymore, but can be located in    [    t  v    (  x  )    ,   1  -    f  v    (  x  )     ]        subscript  t  v   x     1     subscript  f  v   x      [t_{v}(x),1-f_{v}(x)]   . This interval can be interpreted as an extension to the fuzzy membership function. The vague set degrades to a fuzzy set, if     1  -    f  v    (  x  )     =    t  v    (  x  )          1     subscript  f  v   x       subscript  t  v   x     1-f_{v}(x)=t_{v}(x)   for all x. The uncertainty of x is the difference between the upper and lower bounds of the membership interval; it can be computed as     (   1  -    f  v    (  x  )     )   -    t  v    (  x  )          1     subscript  f  v   x       subscript  t  v   x     (1-f_{v}(x))-t_{v}(x)   .
