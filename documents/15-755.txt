Vague set

In mathematics, vague sets are an extension of fuzzy sets. In a fuzzy set, each object is assigned a single value in the interval [0,1] reflecting its grade of membership. Unfortunately, this single value does not allow a separation of evidence for membership and evidence against membership. Gau et al.1 proposed the notion of vague sets, where each object is characterized by two different membership functions: a true membership function and a false membership function. This kind of reasoning is also called interval membership, as opposed to point membership in the context of fuzzy sets.
Mathematical definition
A vague set 
 
 
 
  is characterized by

its true membership function 
 
 

its false membership function 
 
 

with 
 
 


The grade of membership for x is not a crisp value anymore, but can be located in 
 
 
 
 . This interval can be interpreted as an extension to the fuzzy membership function. The vague set degrades to a fuzzy set, if 
 
 
 
  for all x. The uncertainty of x is the difference between the upper and lower bounds of the membership interval; it can be computed as 
 
 
 
 .
