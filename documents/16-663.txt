   Hyper-Erlang distribution      Hyper-Erlang distribution   In probability theory , a hyper-Erlang distribution is a continuous probability distribution which takes a particular Erlang distribution E i with probability p i . A hyper-Erlang distributed random variable X has probability density function given by       A   (  x  )    =    ∑   i  =  1   n     p  i    E   l  i     (  x  )           A  x     superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  p  i    subscript  E   subscript  l  i    x      A(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}E_{l_{i}}(x)   where each p i > 0 with the p i summing to 1 and each of the E l i being an Erlang distribution with l i stages each of which has parameter λ i . 1 2 3  See also   Phase-type distribution   References  "  Category:Continuous distributions  Category:Probability distributions     ↩  ↩  ↩
