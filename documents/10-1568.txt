   Thiosulfate dehydrogenase      Thiosulfate dehydrogenase   Thiosulfate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 thiosulfate + 2 ferricytochrome c   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   tetrathionate + 2 ferrocytochrome c   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are thiosulfate and ferricytochrome c , whereas its two products are tetrathionate and ferrocytochrome c .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with a cytochrome as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is thiosulfate:ferricytochrome-c oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include tetrathionate synthase , thiosulfate oxidase , thiosulfate-oxidizing enzyme , and thiosulfate-acceptor oxidoreductase .
