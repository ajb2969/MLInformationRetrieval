   NGC 4845      NGC 4845   NGC 4845 (also known as NGC 4910 ) is a spiral galaxy located in the constellation Virgo 47 million light years away. The galaxy was originally discovered by William Herschel in 1786. 1  The galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center with a mass of 300,000       M  ⊙          subscript  M  direct-product      \begin{smallmatrix}M_{\odot}\end{smallmatrix}   . In 2013, the ESA observed the black hole absorbing matter from a nearby, low-mass object; possibly a brown dwarf star. 2 The observed X-ray flare was caught by the ESA's INTEGRAL telescope. 3  References  External links     "  Category:Virgo (constellation)     ↩  ↩  ↩
