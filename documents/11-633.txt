   Purine nucleosidase      Purine nucleosidase   In enzymology , a purine nucleosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a purine nucleoside + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-ribose + a purine base   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are purine nucleoside and H 2 O , whereas its two products are D-ribose and purine base .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosylases that hydrolyse N-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is purine-nucleoside ribohydrolase . Other names in common use include nucleosidase , purine beta-ribosidase , purine nucleoside hydrolase , purine ribonucleosidase , ribonucleoside hydrolase , nucleoside hydrolase , N-ribosyl purine ribohydrolase , nucleosidase g , N-D-ribosylpurine ribohydrolase , inosine-adenosine-guanosine preferring nucleoside hydrolase , purine-specific nucleoside N-ribohydrolase , IAG-nucleoside hydrolase , and IAG-NH . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 11 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , and .
