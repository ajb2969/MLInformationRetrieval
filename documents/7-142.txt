   Lagrange's theorem (number theory)      Lagrange's theorem (number theory)   In number theory , Lagrange's theorem is a statement named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange about how frequently a polynomial over the integers may evaluate to a multiple of a fixed prime. More precisely, it states that if p is a prime number and     f   (  x  )    ∈   ℤ   [  x  ]          f  x     ℤ   delimited-[]  x      \textstyle f(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x]   is a polynomial with integer coefficients, then either:   every coefficient of f(x) is divisible by p , or       f   (  x  )     ≡  p   0      subscript   p     f  x   0    f(x)\equiv_{p}0   has at most deg f(x) incongruent solutions.   Solutions are "incongruent" if they do not differ by a multiple of p . If the modulus is not prime, then it is possible for there to be more than deg f(x) solutions.  A proof of Lagrange's theorem  The two key ideas are the following. Let     g   (  x  )    ∈    (   ℤ  /  p   )    [  x  ]          g  x       ℤ  p    delimited-[]  x      \textstyle g(x)\in(\mathbb{Z}/p)[x]   be the polynomial obtained from    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   by taking the coefficients     mod  p     modulo  absent  p    \mod p   . Now (i)    f   (  k  )       f  k    f(k)   is divisible by   p   p   p   if and only if     g   (  k  )    =  0        g  k   0    g(k)=0   ; (ii)    g   (  k  )       g  k    g(k)   has no more roots than its degree.  More rigorously, start by noting that     g   (  x  )    =  0        g  x   0    g(x)=0   if and only if each coefficient of    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   is divisible by   p   p   p   . Assume    g   (  x  )       g  x    g(x)   is not 0; its degree is thus well-defined. It's easy to see      deg  g    (  x  )    ≤    deg  f    (  x  )           degree  g   x      degree  f   x     \textstyle\deg g(x)\leq\deg f(x)   . To prove (i), first note that we can compute    g   (  k  )       g  k    g(k)   either directly, i.e. by plugging in (the residue class of)   k   k   k   and performing arithmetic in    ℤ  /  p      ℤ  p    \textstyle\mathbb{Z}/p   , or by reducing     f   (  k  )    mod  p     modulo    f  k   p    f(k)\mod p   . Hence     g   (  k  )    =  0        g  k   0    g(k)=0   if and only if     f   (  k  )     ≡  p   0      subscript   p     f  k   0    f(k)\equiv_{p}0   , i.e. if and only if    f   (  k  )       f  k    f(k)   is divisible by   p   p   p   . To prove (ii), note that    ℤ  /  p      ℤ  p    \textstyle\mathbb{Z}/p   is a field, which is a standard fact; a quick proof is to note that since   p   p   p   is prime,    ℤ  /  p      ℤ  p    \textstyle\mathbb{Z}/p   is a finite integral domain, hence is a field. Another standard fact is that a non-zero polynomial over a field has at most as many roots as its degree; this follows from the division algorithm.  Finally, note that two solutions      f   (   k  1   )    ,   f   (   k  2   )      ≡  p   0      subscript   p      f   subscript  k  1      f   subscript  k  2     0    \textstyle f(k_{1}),f(k_{2})\equiv_{p}0   are incongruent if and only if     k  1    ≢  p    k  2       subscript  not-equivalent-to  p    subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2     \textstyle k_{1}\not\equiv_{p}k_{2}   . Putting it all together: the number of incongruent solutions by (i) is the same as the number of roots of    g   (  x  )       g  x    g(x)   , which by (ii) is at most     deg  g    (  x  )        degree  g   x    \deg g(x)   , which is at most     deg  f    (  x  )        degree  f   x    \deg f(x)   .
