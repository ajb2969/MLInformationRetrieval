(a,b)-tree

In computer science, an (a,b) tree is a kind of balanced search tree.
An (a,b)-tree has all of its leaves at the same depth, and all internal nodes except for the root have between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
children, where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are integers such that 
 
 
 
 . The root has, if it is not a leaf, between 2 and 
 
 
 
  children.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be positive integers such that 
 
 
 
 . Then a rooted tree

 
  is an (a,b)-tree when:

Every inner node except the root has at least 
 
 
 
  and at most 
 
 
 
  children.
The root has at most 
 
 
 
  children.
All paths from the root to the leaves are of the same length.

Inner node representation
Every inner node 
 
 
 
  has the following representation:

Let 
 
 
 
  be the number of child nodes of node v.
Let 
 
 
 
  be pointers to child nodes.
Let 
 
 
 
  be an array of keys such that 
 
 
 
  equals the largest key in the subtree pointed to by 
 
 
 
 .
