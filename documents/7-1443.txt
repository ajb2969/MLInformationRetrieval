   (a,b)-tree      (a,b)-tree   In computer science , an (a,b) tree is a kind of balanced search tree .  An (a,b)-tree has all of its leaves at the same depth, and all internal nodes except for the root have between   a   a   a   and   b   b   b    children , where   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   are integers such that     2  ≤  a  ≤   (   b  +  1   )    /  2        2  normal-≤  a  normal-≤    b  1    2    2≤a≤(b+1)/2   . The root has, if it is not a leaf, between 2 and   b   b   b   children.  Definition  Let   a   a   a   ,   b   b   b   be positive integers such that     2  ≤  a  ≤   (   b  +  1   )    /  2        2  normal-≤  a  normal-≤    b  1    2    2≤a≤(b+1)/2   . Then a rooted tree    T   T   T   is an (a,b)-tree when:   Every inner node except the root has at least   a   a   a   and at most   b   b   b   children.  The root has at most   b   b   b   children.  All paths from the root to the leaves are of the same length.   Inner node representation  Every inner node   v   v   v   has the following representation:   Let    ρ  v     subscript  ρ  v    \rho_{v}   be the number of child nodes of node v.  Let     S  v    [   1  …   ρ  v    ]        subscript  S  v    delimited-[]    1  normal-…   subscript  ρ  v       S_{v}[1\dots\rho_{v}]   be pointers to child nodes.  Let     H  v    [    1  …   ρ  v    -  1   ]        subscript  H  v    delimited-[]      1  normal-…   subscript  ρ  v    1      H_{v}[1\dots\rho_{v}-1]   be an array of keys such that     H  v    [  i  ]        subscript  H  v    delimited-[]  i     H_{v}[i]   equals the largest key in the subtree pointed to by     S  v    [  i  ]        subscript  S  v    delimited-[]  i     S_{v}[i]   .
