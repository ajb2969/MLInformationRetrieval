CEP subgroup

In mathematics, in the field of group theory, a subgroup of a group is said to have the Congruence Extension Property or to be a CEP subgroup if every congruence on the subgroup lifts to a congruence of the whole group. Equivalently, every normal subgroup of the subgroup arises as the intersection with the subgroup of a normal subgroup of the whole group.
In symbols, a subgroup 
 
 
 
  is normal in a group 
 
 
 
  if every normal subgroup 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  can be realized as 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is normal in 
 
 
 
 .
The following facts are known about CEP subgroups:

Every retract has the CEP.
Every transitively normal subgroup has the CEP.
