   CEP subgroup      CEP subgroup   In mathematics , in the field of group theory , a subgroup of a group is said to have the Congruence Extension Property or to be a CEP subgroup if every congruence on the subgroup lifts to a congruence of the whole group. Equivalently, every normal subgroup of the subgroup arises as the intersection with the subgroup of a normal subgroup of the whole group.  In symbols, a subgroup   H   H   H   is normal in a group   G   G   G   if every normal subgroup   N   N   N   of   H   H   H   can be realized as    H  âˆ©  M      H  M    H\cap M   where   M   M   M   is normal in   G   G   G   .  The following facts are known about CEP subgroups:   Every retract has the CEP.  Every transitively normal subgroup has the CEP.   References    .   .   "  Category:Subgroup properties
