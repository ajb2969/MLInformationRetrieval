   A-equivalence      A-equivalence   In mathematics ,    𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   -equivalence , sometimes called right-left equivalence , is an equivalence relation between map germs .  Let   M   M   M   and   N   N   N   be two manifolds , and let     f  ,  g   :    (  M  ,  x  )   →   (  N  ,  y  )       normal-:   f  g    normal-→   M  x    N  y      f,g:(M,x)\to(N,y)   be two smooth map germs . We say that   f   f   f   and   g   g   g   are   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   -equivalent if there exist diffeomorphism germs    ϕ  :    (  M  ,  x  )   →   (  M  ,  x  )       normal-:  ϕ   normal-→   M  x    M  x      \phi:(M,x)\to(M,x)   and    ψ  :    (  N  ,  y  )   →   (  N  ,  y  )       normal-:  ψ   normal-→   N  y    N  y      \psi:(N,y)\to(N,y)   such that      ψ  ∘  f   =   g  ∘  ϕ    .        ψ  f     g  ϕ     \psi\circ f=g\circ\phi.     In other words, two map germs are   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   -equivalent if one can be taken onto the other by a diffeomorphic change of co-ordinates in the source (i.e.   M   M   M   ) and the target (i.e.   N   N   N   ).  Let    Ω   (   M  x   ,   N  y   )       normal-Ω    subscript  M  x    subscript  N  y      \Omega(M_{x},N_{y})   denote the space of smooth map germs       (  M  ,  x  )   →   (  N  ,  y  )    .     normal-→   M  x    N  y     (M,x)\to(N,y).   Let    diff   (   M  x   )       diff   subscript  M  x     \mbox{diff}(M_{x})   be the group of diffeomorphism germs     (  M  ,  x  )   →   (  M  ,  x  )      normal-→   M  x    M  x     (M,x)\to(M,x)   and    diff   (   N  y   )       diff   subscript  N  y     \mbox{diff}(N_{y})   be the group of diffeomorphism germs      (  N  ,  y  )   →   (  N  ,  y  )    .     normal-→   N  y    N  y     (N,y)\to(N,y).   The group    G  :=     diff   (   M  x   )    ×  diff    (   N  y   )       assign  G        diff   subscript  M  x    diff    subscript  N  y      G:=\mbox{diff}(M_{x})\times\mbox{diff}(N_{y})   acts on    Ω   (   M  x   ,   N  y   )       normal-Ω    subscript  M  x    subscript  N  y      \Omega(M_{x},N_{y})   in the natural way       (  ϕ  ,  ψ  )   ⋅  f   =    ψ   -  1    ∘  f  ∘  ϕ    .       normal-⋅   ϕ  ψ   f      superscript  ψ    1    f  ϕ     (\phi,\psi)\cdot f=\psi^{-1}\circ f\circ\phi.   Under this action we see that the map germs      f  ,  g   :    (  M  ,  x  )   →   (  N  ,  y  )       normal-:   f  g    normal-→   M  x    N  y      f,g:(M,x)\to(N,y)   are   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   -equivalent if, and only if,   g   g   g   lies in the orbit of   f   f   f   , i.e.    g  ∈    orb  G    (  f  )        g     subscript  orb  G   f     g\in\mbox{orb}_{G}(f)   (or vice versa).  A map germ is called stable if its orbit under the action of    G  :=     diff   (   M  x   )    ×  diff    (   N  y   )       assign  G        diff   subscript  M  x    diff    subscript  N  y      G:=\mbox{diff}(M_{x})\times\mbox{diff}(N_{y})   is open relative to the Whitney topology . Since    Ω   (   M  x   ,   N  y   )       normal-Ω    subscript  M  x    subscript  N  y      \Omega(M_{x},N_{y})   is an infinite dimensional space metric topology is no longer trivial. Whitney topology compares the differences in successive derivatives and gives a notion of proximity within the infinite dimensional space. A base for the open sets of the topology in question is given by taking   k   k   k   -jets for every   k   k   k   and taking open  neighbourhoods in the ordinary Euclidean sense. Open sets in the topology are then unions of these base sets.  Consider the orbit of some map germ      o  r   b  G    (  f  )    .      o  r   subscript  b  G   f    orb_{G}(f).   The map germ    f   f   f   is called simple if there are only finitely many other orbits in a neighbourhood of each of its points. Vladimir Arnold has shown that the only simple singular  map germs      (   ℝ  n   ,  0  )   →   (  ℝ  ,  0  )      normal-→    superscript  ℝ  n   0    ℝ  0     (\mathbb{R}^{n},0)\to(\mathbb{R},0)   for    1  ≤  n  ≤  3        1  n       3     1\leq n\leq 3   are the infinite sequence    A  k     subscript  A  k    A_{k}   (    k  ∈  ℕ      k  ℕ    k\in\mathbb{N}   ), the infinite sequence    D   4  +  k      subscript  D    4  k     D_{4+k}   (    k  ∈  ℕ      k  ℕ    k\in\mathbb{N}   ),     E  6   ,     subscript  E  6    E_{6},        E  7   ,     subscript  E  7    E_{7},   and     E  8   .     subscript  E  8    E_{8}.
