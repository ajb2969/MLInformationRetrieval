3-cyanoalanine hydratase

In enzymology, a 3-cyanoalanine hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-asparagine 
 
 
 
  3-cyanoalanine + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-asparagine, and two products, 3-cyanoalanine and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-asparagine hydro-lyase (3-cyanoalanine-forming). Other names in common use include beta-cyanoalanine hydrolase, beta-cyanoalanine hydratase, beta-CNAla hydrolase, beta-CNA nitrilase, and L-asparagine hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in cyanoamino acid metabolism.
