   Capillary length      Capillary length   In fluid mechanics , capillary length is a characteristic length scale for an interface between two fluids which is subject both to gravitational acceleration and to a surface force due to surface tension in the interface.  The capillary length is defined as: 1       λ  c   =    γ   ρ  g          subscript  λ  c       γ    ρ  g       \lambda_{c}=\sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{\rho g}}   ,  where   g   g   g   is the gravitational acceleration and   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the density of the fluid, and   γ   γ   \gamma   is the surface tension of the fluid-fluid interface.   For clean water and air at standard temperature and pressure, the capillary length is around 2 mm.    For a soap bubble in air , the capillary length is around 4 meters (13 feet).   A capillary surface that has a characteristic length smaller than the capillary length can be considered a low Bond number surface. A sessile drop whose largest dimension is smaller than the capillary length, for example, will take the shape of spherical cap , which is the solution to the Young-Laplace equation with gravity completely absent.
