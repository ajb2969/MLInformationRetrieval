Probabilistic CTL

Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) is an extension of computation tree logic (CTL) which allows for probabilistic quantification of described properties. It has been defined in the paper by Hansson and Jonsson.1
PCTL is a useful logic for stating soft deadline properties, e.g. "after a request for a service, there is at least a 98% probability that the service will be carried out within 2 seconds". Akin CTL suitability for model-checking PCTL extension is widely used as a property specification language for probabilistic model checkers.
PCTL syntax
One of the possible syntax of PCTL is defined as follows:





Therein, 
 
 
 
  is comparison operator and 
 
 
 
  is a probability threshold.
 Formulas of PCTL are interpreted over discrete Markov chains. An interpretation structure is a quadruple 
 
 
 
 , where



 
  is a finite set of states,


 
  is an initial state,


 
  is a transition probability function, 
 
 
 
 , such that for all 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
 , and


 
  is a labeling function, 
 
 
 
 , assigning atomic propositions to states.


 A path 
 
 
 
  from a state 
 
 
 
  is an infinite sequence of states 
 
 
 
 . The n-th state of the path is denoted as 
 
 
 
  and the prefix of 
 
 
 
  of length 
 
 
 
  is denoted as 
 
 
 
 .
Probability measure
A probability measure 
 
 
 
  of the set of path with the common prefix of length 
 
 
 
  is equal to the product of transitions probabilitites along the prefix of the path:





For 
 
 
 
  the probability measure is equal to 
 
 
 
 .
Satisfaction relations
Satisfaction relations 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are inductively defined as follows:



 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  if and only if not 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 , and


 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 .
