   D-cysteine desulfhydrase      D-cysteine desulfhydrase   In enzymology , a D-cysteine desulfhydrase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-cysteine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   sulfide + NH 3 + pyruvate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-cysteine and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are sulfide , NH 3 , and pyruvate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-cysteine sulfide-lyase (deaminating; pyruvate-forming) . Other names in common use include D-cysteine lyase , and D-cysteine sulfide-lyase (deaminating) . This enzyme participates in cysteine metabolism .
