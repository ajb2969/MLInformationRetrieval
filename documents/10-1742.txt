D-cysteine desulfhydrase

In enzymology, a D-cysteine desulfhydrase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-cysteine + H2O 
 
 
 
  sulfide + NH3 + pyruvate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-cysteine and H2O, whereas its 3 products are sulfide, NH3, and pyruvate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-cysteine sulfide-lyase (deaminating; pyruvate-forming). Other names in common use include D-cysteine lyase, and D-cysteine sulfide-lyase (deaminating). This enzyme participates in cysteine metabolism.
