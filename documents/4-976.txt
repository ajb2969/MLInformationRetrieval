   Carathéodory's theorem (convex hull)      Carathéodory's theorem (convex hull)   (Figure)  An illustration of Carathéodory's theorem for a square in R 2    See also Carathéodory's theorem (disambiguation) for other meanings    In convex geometry  Carathéodory's theorem states that if a point x of R d lies in the convex hull of a set P , there is a subset ′ of P consisting of d + 1 or fewer points such that x lies in the convex hull of ′. Equivalently, x lies in an r - simplex with vertices in P , where    r  ≤  d      r  d    r\leq d   . The result is named for Constantin Carathéodory , who proved the theorem in 1911 for the case when P is compact. In 1914 Ernst Steinitz expanded Carathéodory's theorem for any sets P in R d .  For example, consider a set P = {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)} which is a subset of R 2 . The convex hull of this set is a square. Consider now a point x = (1/4, 1/4), which is in the convex hull of P . We can then construct a set {(0,0),(0,1),(1,0)} = ′, the convex hull of which is a triangle and encloses x , and thus the theorem works for this instance, since |′| = 3. It may help to visualise Carathéodory's theorem in 2 dimensions, as saying that we can construct a triangle consisting of points from P that encloses any point in P .  Proof  Let x be a point in the convex hull of P . Then, x is a convex combination of a finite number of points in P :      𝐱  =    ∑   j  =  1   k     λ  j    𝐱  j         𝐱    superscript   subscript     j  1    k      subscript  λ  j    subscript  𝐱  j       \mathbf{x}=\sum_{j=1}^{k}\lambda_{j}\mathbf{x}_{j}     where every x j is in P , every λ j is non-negative, and      ∑   j  =  1   k    λ  j    =  1        superscript   subscript     j  1    k    subscript  λ  j    1    \sum_{j=1}^{k}\lambda_{j}=1   .  Suppose k > d + 1 (otherwise, there is nothing to prove). Then, the points x 2 − x 1 , ..., x ''k'' − x 1 are linearly dependent ,  so there are real scalars μ 2 , ..., μ k , not all zero, such that        ∑   j  =  2   k     μ  j    (    𝐱  j   -   𝐱  1    )     =  0.        superscript   subscript     j  2    k      subscript  μ  j      subscript  𝐱  j    subscript  𝐱  1      0.    \sum_{j=2}^{k}\mu_{j}(\mathbf{x}_{j}-\mathbf{x}_{1})=\mathbf{0}.     If μ 1 is defined as       μ  1   :=   -    ∑   j  =  2   k    μ  j        assign   subscript  μ  1       superscript   subscript     j  2    k    subscript  μ  j       \mu_{1}:=-\sum_{j=2}^{k}\mu_{j}     then        ∑   j  =  1   k     μ  j    𝐱  j     =  𝟎        superscript   subscript     j  1    k      subscript  μ  j    subscript  𝐱  j     0    \sum_{j=1}^{k}\mu_{j}\mathbf{x}_{j}=\mathbf{0}           ∑   j  =  1   k    μ  j    =  0        superscript   subscript     j  1    k    subscript  μ  j    0    \sum_{j=1}^{k}\mu_{j}=0     and not all of the μ j are equal to zero. Therefore, at least one μ j > 0. Then,      𝐱  =     ∑   j  =  1   k     λ  j    𝐱  j     -   α    ∑   j  =  1   k     μ  j    𝐱  j       =    ∑   j  =  1   k     (    λ  j   -   α   μ  j     )    𝐱  j           𝐱      superscript   subscript     j  1    k      subscript  λ  j    subscript  𝐱  j       α    superscript   subscript     j  1    k      subscript  μ  j    subscript  𝐱  j              superscript   subscript     j  1    k        subscript  λ  j     α   subscript  μ  j      subscript  𝐱  j        \mathbf{x}=\sum_{j=1}^{k}\lambda_{j}\mathbf{x}_{j}-\alpha\sum_{j=1}^{k}\mu_{j}%
 \mathbf{x}_{j}=\sum_{j=1}^{k}(\lambda_{j}-\alpha\mu_{j})\mathbf{x}_{j}     for any real α . In particular, the equality will hold if α is defined as       α  :=    min   1  ≤  j  ≤  k     {      λ  j    μ  j     :    μ  j   >  0    }    =     λ  i    μ  i      .       assign  α    subscript       1  j       k      normal-:     subscript  λ  j    subscript  μ  j       subscript  μ  j   0             subscript  λ  i    subscript  μ  i       \alpha:=\min_{1\leq j\leq k}\left\{\tfrac{\lambda_{j}}{\mu_{j}}:\mu_{j}>0%
 \right\}=\tfrac{\lambda_{i}}{\mu_{i}}.     Note that α >0, and for every j between 1 and k ,        λ  j   -   α   μ  j     ≥  0.         subscript  λ  j     α   subscript  μ  j     0.    \lambda_{j}-\alpha\mu_{j}\geq 0.     In particular, λ i − αμ i = 0 by definition of α . Therefore,      𝐱  =    ∑   j  =  1   k     (    λ  j   -   α   μ  j     )    𝐱  j         𝐱    superscript   subscript     j  1    k        subscript  λ  j     α   subscript  μ  j      subscript  𝐱  j       \mathbf{x}=\sum_{j=1}^{k}(\lambda_{j}-\alpha\mu_{j})\mathbf{x}_{j}     where every     λ  j   -   α   μ  j         subscript  λ  j     α   subscript  μ  j      \lambda_{j}-\alpha\mu_{j}   is nonnegative, their sum is one , and furthermore,      λ  i   -   α   μ  i     =  0         subscript  λ  i     α   subscript  μ  i     0    \lambda_{i}-\alpha\mu_{i}=0   . In other words, x is represented as a convex combination of at most k -1 points of P . This process can be repeated until x is represented as a convex combination of at most d + 1 points in P .
