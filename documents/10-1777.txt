Leukotriene-C4 synthase

In enzymology, a leukotriene-C4 synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

leukotriene C4

 
  leukotriene A4 + glutathione
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, leukotriene C4, and two products, leukotriene A4 and glutathione.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is leukotriene-C4 glutathione-lyase (leukotriene-A4-forming). Other names in common use include leukotriene C4 synthetase, LTC4 synthase, LTC4 synthetase, leukotriene A4:glutathione S-leukotrienyltransferase, (7E,9E,11Z,14Z)-(5S,6R)-5,6-epoxyicosa-7,9,11,14-, tetraenoate:glutathione leukotriene-transferase, (epoxide-ring-opening), (7E,9E,11Z,14Z)-(5S,6R)-6-(glutathion-S-yl)-5-hydroxyicosa-, and 7,9,11,14-tetraenoate glutathione-lyase (epoxide-forming). This enzyme participates in arachidonic acid metabolism.
