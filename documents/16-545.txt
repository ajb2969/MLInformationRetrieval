Integration along fibers

In differential geometry, the integration along fibers of a k-form yields a 
 
 
 
 -form where m is the dimension of the fiber, via "integration". More precisely, let 
 
 
 
  be a fiber bundle over a manifold with compact oriented fibers. If 
 
 
 
  is a k-form on E, then let:



where 
 
 
 
  is the induced top-form on the fiber 
 
 
 
 ; i.e., an 
 
 
 
 -form given by



(To see 
 
 
 
  is smooth, work it out in coordinates; cf. an example below.)


 
  is then a linear map 
 
 
 
 , which is in fact surjective. By Stokes' formula, if the fibers have no boundaries, the map descends to de Rham cohomology:



This is also called the fiber integration. Now, suppose 
 
 
 
  is a sphere bundle; i.e., the typical fiber is a sphere. Then there is an exact sequence

 
 , K the kernel, which leads to a long exact sequence, using 
 
 
 
 :


 
 , called the Gysin sequence.
Example
Let 
 
 
 
  be an obvious projection. For simplicity, assume 
 
 
 
  with coordinates 
 
 
 
  and consider a k-form:



Then, at each point in M,



From this the next formula follows easily: if 
 
 
 
  is any k-form on 
 
 




where 
 
 
 
  is the restriction of 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . This formula is a special case of Stokes' formula. As an application of this, let 
 
 
 
  be a smooth map (thought of as a homotopy). Then the composition 
 
 
 
  is a homotopy operator:



which implies 
 
 
 
  induces the same map on cohomology. For example, let U be an open ball with center at the origin and let 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 , the fact known as the Poincar√© lemma.
