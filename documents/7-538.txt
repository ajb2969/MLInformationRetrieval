Schoof's algorithm

Schoof's algorithm is an efficient algorithm to count points on elliptic curves over finite fields. The algorithm has applications in elliptic curve cryptography where it is important to know the number of points to judge the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem in the group of points on an elliptic curve.
The algorithm was published by René Schoof in 1985 and it was a theoretical breakthrough, as it was the first deterministic polynomial time algorithm for counting points on elliptic curves. Before Schoof's algorithm, approaches to counting points on elliptic curves such as the naive and baby-step giant-step algorithms were, for the most part, tedious and had an exponential running time.
This article explains Schoof's approach, laying emphasis on the mathematical ideas underlying the structure of the algorithm.
Introduction
Let 
 
 
 
  be an elliptic curve defined over the finite field 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  a prime and 
 
 
 
  an integer 
 
 
 
 . Over a field of characteristic 
 
 
 
  an elliptic curve can be given by a (short) Weierstrass equation


 
  with 
 
 
 
 . The set of points defined over 
 
 
 
  consists of the solutions 
 
 
 
  satisfying the curve equation and a point at infinity

 
 . Using the group law on elliptic curves restricted to this set one can see that this set 
 
 
 
  forms an abelian group, with 
 
 
 
  acting as the zero element. In order to count points on an elliptic curve, we compute the cardinality of 
 
 
 
 . Schoof's approach to computing the cardinality 
 
 
 
  makes use of Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves along with the Chinese remainder theorem and division polynomials.
Hasse's theorem
Hasse's theorem states that if 
 
 
 
  is an elliptic curve over the finite field 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  satisfies



This powerful result, given by Hasse in 1934, simplifies our problem by narrowing down 
 
 
 
  to a finite (albeit large) set of possibilities. Defining 
 
 
 
  to be 
 
 
 
 , and making use of this result, we now have that computing the cardinality of 
 
 
 
  modulo 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 , is sufficient for determining 
 
 
 
 , and thus 
 
 
 
 . While there is no efficient way to compute 
 
 
 
  directly for general 
 
 
 
 , it is possible to compute 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  a small prime, rather efficiently. We choose 
 
 
 
  to be a set of distinct primes such that 
 
 
 
 . Given 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , the Chinese remainder theorem allows us to compute 
 
 
 
 .
In order to compute 
 
 
 
  for a prime 
 
 
 
 , we make use of the theory of the Frobenius endomorphism 
 
 
 
  and division polynomials. Note that considering primes 
 
 
 
  is no loss since we can always pick a bigger prime to take its place to ensure the product is big enough. In any case Schoof's algorithm is most frequently used in addressing the case 
 
 
 
  since there are more efficient, so called 
 
 
 
  adic algorithms for small-characteristic fields.
The Frobenius endomorphism
Given the elliptic curve 
 
 
 
  defined over 
 
 
 
  we consider points on 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
 , the algebraic closure of 
 
 
 
 ; i.e. we allow points with coordinates in 
 
 
 
 . The Frobenius endomorphism of 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  extends to the elliptic curve by 
 
 
 
 .
This map is the identity on 
 
 
 
  and one can extend it to the point at infinity 
 
 
 
 , making it a group morphism from 
 
 
 
  to itself.
The Frobenius endomorphism satisfies a quadratic polynomial which is linked to the cardinality of 
 
 
 
  by the following theorem:
Theorem: The Frobenius endomorphism given by 
 
 
 
  satisfies the characteristic equation


 
  where 
 
 

Thus we have for all 
 
 
 
  that 
 
 
 
 , where + denotes addition on the elliptic curve and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denote scalar multiplication of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  and of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 .
One could try to symbolically compute these points 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as functions in the coordinate ring

 
  of 
 
 
 
  and the search for a value of 
 
 
 
  which satisfies the equation. However, the degrees get very large and this approach is impractical.
Schoof's idea was to carry out this computation restricted to points of order 
 
 
 
  for various small primes 
 
 
 
 . Fixing an odd prime 
 
 
 
 , we now move on to solving the problem of determining 
 
 
 
 , defined as 
 
 
 
 , for a given prime 
 
 
 
 . If a point 
 
 
 
  is in the 
 
 
 
 -torsion subgroup

 
 , then 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the unique integer such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Note that 
 
 
 
  and that for any integer 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
 . Thus 
 
 
 
  will have the same order as 
 
 
 
 . Thus for 
 
 
 
  belonging to 
 
 
 
 , we also have 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 . Hence we have reduced our problem to solving the equation



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have integer values in 
 
 
 
 .
Computation modulo primes
The 
 
 
 
 th division polynomial is such that its roots are precisely the 
 
 
 
  coordinates of points of order 
 
 
 
 . Thus, to restrict the computation of 
 
 
 
  to the 
 
 
 
 -torsion points means computing these expressions as functions in the coordinate ring of 
 
 
and modulo the 
 
 
 
 th division polynomial. I.e. we are working in 
 
 
 
 . This means in particular that the degree of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  defined via 
 
 
 
  is at most 1 in 
 
 
 
  and at most 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
The scalar multiplication 
 
 
 
  can be done either by double-and-add methods or by using the 
 
 
 
 th division polynomial. The latter approach gives:



where 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
 th division polynomial. Note that 
 
 
 
  is a function in 
 
 
 
  only and denote it by 
 
 
 
 .
We must split the problem into two cases: the case in which 
 
 
 
 , and the case in which 
 
 
 
 . Note that these equalities are checked modulo 
 
 
 
 .
Case 1 
 
 

By using the addition formula for the group 
 
 
 
  we obtain:


 
  Note that this computation fails in case the assumption of inequality was wrong.
We are now able to use the 
 
 
 
 -coordinate to narrow down the choice of 
 
 
 
  to two possibilities, namely the positive and negative case. Using the 
 
 
 
 -coordinate one later determines which of the two cases holds.
We first show that 
 
 
 
  is a function in 
 
 
 
  alone. Consider 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  is even, by replacing 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 , we rewrite the expression as



and have that



Now if 
 
 
 
  for one 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  satisfies



for all 
 
 
 
 -torsion points 
 
 
 
 .
As mentioned earlier, using 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  we are now able to determine which of the two values of 
 
 
 
  (
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 ) works. This gives the value of 
 
 
 
 . Schoof's algorithm stores the values of 
 
 
 
  in a variable 
 
 
 
  for each prime 
 
 
 
  considered.
Case 2 
 
 

We begin with the assumption that 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  is an odd prime it cannot be that 
 
 
 
  and thus 
 
 
 
 . The characteristic equation yields that 
 
 
 
 . And consequently that 
 
 
 
 . This implies that 
 
 
 
  is a square modulo 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
 . Compute 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and check whether 
 
 
 
 . If so, 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  depending on the y-coordinate.
If 
 
 
 
  turns out not to be a square modulo 
 
 
 
  or if the equation does not hold for any of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , our assumption that 
 
 
 
  is false, thus 
 
 
 
 . The characteristic equation gives 
 
 
 
 .
Additional case 
 
 

If you recall, our initial considerations omit the case of 
 
 
 
 . Since we assume 
 
 
 
  to be odd, 
 
 
 
  and in particular, 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  has an element of order 2. By definition of addition in the group, any element of order 2 must be of the form 
 
 
 
 . Thus 
 
 
 
  if and only if the polynomial 
 
 
 
  has a root in 
 
 
 
 , if and only if 
 
 
 
 .
The algorithm

(1) Choose a set of odd primes 
 
 
 
  not containing 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 

(2) Put 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 , else 
 
 
 
 .
 
(3) Compute the division polynomial 
 
 
 
 . All computations in the loop below are performed in the ring 
 
 

(4) For 
 
 
 
  do:

  be the unique integer such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .

  then 
 
 

(v) else 
 
 



(e) else 
 
 



(5) Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to compute 
 
 
 
  modulo 
 
 
 
 .
 

Note that since the set 
 
 
 
  was chosen so that 
 
 
 
 , by Hasse's theorem, we in fact know 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  precisely.
Complexity
Most of the computation is taken by the evaluation of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , for each prime 
 
 
 
 , that is computing 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  for each prime 
 
 
 
 . This involves exponentiation in the ring 
 
 
 
  and requires 
 
 
 
  multiplications. Since the degree of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , each element in the ring is a polynomial of degree 
 
 
 
 . By the prime number theorem, there are around 
 
 
 
  primes of size 
 
 
 
 , giving that 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  and we obtain that 
 
 
 
 . Thus each multiplication in the ring 
 
 
 
  requires 
 
 
 
  multiplications in 
 
 
 
  which in turn requires 
 
 
 
  bit operations. In total, the number of bit operations for each prime 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . Given that this computation needs to be carried out for each of the 
 
 
 
  primes, the total complexity of Schoof's algorithm turns out to be 
 
 
 
 . Using fast polynomial and integer arithmetic reduces this to 
 
 
 
 .
Improvements to Schoof's algorithm
In the 1990s, Noam Elkies, followed by A. O. L. Atkin, devised improvements to Schoof's basic algorithm by restricting the set of primes 
 
 
 
  considered before to primes of a certain kind. These came to be called Elkies primes and Atkin primes respectively. A prime 
 
 
 
  is called an Elkies prime if the characteristic equation
 
 
 
  splits over 
 
 
 
 , while an Atkin prime is a prime that is not an Elkies prime. Atkin showed how to combine information obtained from the Atkin primes with the information obtained from Elkies primes to produce an efficient algorithm, which came to be known as the Schoof–Elkies–Atkin algorithm. The first problem to address is to determine whether a given prime is Elkies or Atkin. In order to do so, we make use of modular polynomials, which come from the study of modular forms and an interpretation of elliptic curves over the complex numbers as lattices. Once we have determined which case we are in, instead of using division polynomials, we are able to work with a polynomial that has lower degree than the corresponding division polynomial
 
 
 
  rather than 
 
 
 
 . For efficient implementation, probabilistic root-finding algorithms are used, which makes this a Las Vegas algorithm rather than a deterministic algorithm. Under the heuristic assumption that approximately half of the primes up to an 
 
 
 
  bound are Elkies primes, this yields an algorithm that is more efficient than Schoof's, with an expected running time of 
 
 
 
  using naive arithmetic, and 
 
 
 
  using fast arithmetic. It should be noted that while this heuristic assumption is known to hold for most elliptic curves, it is not known to hold in every case, even under the GRH.
Implementations
Several algorithms were implemented in C++ by Mike Scott and are available with source code. The implementations are free (no terms, no conditions), and make use of the MIRACL library which is distributed under the AGPLv3.
