Malonate decarboxylase holo-(acyl-carrier protein) synthase

Malonate decarboxylase holo-(acyl-carrier protein) synthase (, holo ACP synthase, 2'-(5-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA:apo ACP 2'-(5-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA transferase, MdcG, 2'-(5-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA:apo-malonate-decarboxylase adenylyltransferase'', holo-malonate-decarboxylase synthase) is an enzyme with system name 2'-(5-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA:apo-malonate-decarboxylase 2'-(5-phosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA-transferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2'-(5-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA + malonate decarboxylase apo-[acyl-carrier protein] 
 
 
 
  malonate decarboxylase holo-[acyl-carrier protein] + diphosphate


The delta subunit of malonate decarboxylase serves as an acyl-carrier protein (ACP) .
