   Mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase      Mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase   In enzymology , a mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GDP-mannose + 3-phospho-D-glycerate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GDP + 2-(alpha-D-mannosyl)-3-phosphoglycerate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GDP-mannose and 3-phospho-D-glycerate , whereas its two products are GDP and 2-(alpha-D-mannosyl)-3-phosphoglycerate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GDP-mannose:3-phosphoglycerate 3-alpha-D-mannosyltransferase . This enzyme is also called MPG synthase .
