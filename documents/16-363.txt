   Production flow analysis      Production flow analysis   In operations management and industrial engineering , production flow analysis refers to methods which share the following characteristics:  1.Classification of machines  2.Technological cycles information control  3.Generating a binary product-machines matrix (1 if a given product requires processing in a given machine, 0 otherwise)  Methods differ on how they group together machines with products. These play an important role in designing manufacturing cells .  Rank Order Clustering  Given a binary product-machines n-by-m matrix $b_{ip}$ , Rank Order Clustering 1 is an algorithm characterized by the following steps:  1.For each row i compute the number $\sum_{p=1}^{m}b_{ip}*2^{m-p}$  2.Order rows according to descending numbers previously computed  3.For each column p compute the number $\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{ip}*2^{n-i}$  4.Order columns according to descending numbers previously computed  5.If on steps 2 and 4 no reordering happened go to step 6, otherwise go to step 1  6.Stop  Similarity Coefficients  Given a binary product-machines n-by-m matrix, the algorithm proceeds 2 by the following steps:  1.Compute the similarity coefficient $s_{ij}=n_{ij}/(n_{ij}+u)$ for all with $n_{ij}$ being the number of products that need to be processed on both machine i and machine j, u comprises the number of components which visit machine j but not k and vice versa.  2.Group together in cell k the tuple (i*,j*) with higher similarity coefficient, with k being the algorithm iteration index  3.Remove row i* and column j* from the original binary matrix and substitute for the row and column of the cell k, $s_{rk}=max(s_{ri*},s_{rj*})$  4.Go to step 2, iteration index k raised by one  Unless this procedure is stopped the algorithm eventually will put all machines in one single group.
