   Tate conjecture      Tate conjecture   In number theory and algebraic geometry , the Tate conjecture is a 1963 conjecture of John Tate that would describe the algebraic cycles on a variety in terms of a more computable invariant, the Galois representation on √©tale cohomology . The Tate conjecture is a central problem in the theory of algebraic cycles. It can be considered an arithmetic analog of the Hodge conjecture .  Statement of the conjecture  Let V be a smooth  projective variety over a field  k which is finitely generated over its prime field . Let k s be a separable closure of k , and let G be the absolute Galois group Gal( k s / k ) of k . Fix a prime number  l which is invertible in k . Consider the l-adic cohomology groups (coefficients in the l-adic integers  Z l , scalars then extended to the l-adic numbers  Q l ) of the base extension of V to k s ; these groups are representations of G . For any i ‚â• 0, a codimension - i subvariety of V (understood to be defined over k ) determines an element of the cohomology group        H   2  i     (   V   k  s    ,    ùêê  l    (  i  )    )    =  W         superscript  H    2  i      subscript  V   subscript  k  s       subscript  ùêê  l   i     W    H^{2i}(V_{k_{s}},\mathbf{Q}_{l}(i))=W     which is fixed by G . Here Q l ( i ) denotes the i th Tate twist , which means that this representation of the Galois group G is tensored with the i th power of the cyclotomic character .  The Tate conjecture states that the subspace W G of W fixed by the Galois group G is spanned, as a Q l -vector space, by the classes of codimension- i subvarieties of V . An algebraic cycle means a finite linear combination of subvarieties; so an equivalent statement is that every element of W G is the class of an algebraic cycle on V with Q l coefficients.  Known cases  The Tate conjecture for divisors (algebraic cycles of codimension 1) is a major open problem. For example, let f : X ‚Üí C be a morphism from a smooth projective surface onto a smooth projective curve over a finite field. Suppose that the generic fiber F of f , which is a curve over the function field  k ( C ), is smooth over k ( C ). Then the Tate conjecture for divisors on X is equivalent to the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for the Jacobian variety of F . 1 By contrast, the Hodge conjecture for divisors on any smooth complex projective variety is known (the Lefschetz (1,1)-theorem ).  Probably the most important known case is that the Tate conjecture is true for divisors on abelian varieties . This is a theorem of Tate for abelian varieties over finite fields, and of Faltings for abelian varieties over number fields, part of Faltings's solution of the Mordell conjecture . Zarhin extended these results to any finitely generated base field. The Tate conjecture for divisors on abelian varieties implies the Tate conjecture for divisors on any product of curves C 1 √ó ... √ó C n . 2  The (known) Tate conjecture for divisors on abelian varieties is equivalent to a powerful statement about homomorphisms between abelian varieties. Namely, for any abelian varieties A and B over a finitely generated field k , the natural map        Hom   (  A  ,  B  )     ‚äó  ùêô    ùêê  l    ‚Üí    Hom  G    (    H  1    (   A   k  s    ,   ùêê  l   )    ,    H  1    (   B   k  s    ,   ùêê  l   )    )       normal-‚Üí    subscript  tensor-product  ùêô     Hom   A  B     subscript  ùêê  l       subscript  Hom  G       subscript  H  1     subscript  A   subscript  k  s     subscript  ùêê  l        subscript  H  1     subscript  B   subscript  k  s     subscript  ùêê  l         \text{Hom}(A,B)\otimes_{\mathbf{Z}}\mathbf{Q}_{l}\rightarrow\text{Hom}_{G}(H_{%
 1}(A_{k_{s}},\mathbf{Q}_{l}),H_{1}(B_{k_{s}},\mathbf{Q}_{l}))     is an isomorphism. 3 In particular, an abelian variety A is determined up to isogeny by the Galois representation on its Tate module  H 1 ( A k s , Z l ).  The Tate conjecture also holds for K3 surfaces over finitely generated fields of characteristic not 2. 4 (On a surface, the nontrivial part of the conjecture is about divisors.) In characteristic zero, the Tate conjecture for K3 surfaces was proved by Andr√© and Tankeev. For K3 surfaces over finite fields of characteristic not 2, the Tate conjecture was proved by Nygaard, Ogus , Charles, Madapusi Pera, and Maulik.  Related conjectures  Let X be a smooth projective variety over a finitely generated field k . The semisimplicity conjecture predicts that the representation of the Galois group G = Gal( k s / k ) on the l -adic cohomology of X is semisimple (that is, a direct sum of irreducible representations ). For k finite of order q , Tate showed that the Tate conjecture plus the semisimplicity conjecture would imply the strong Tate conjecture , namely that the order of the pole of the zeta function  Z ( X , t ) at t = q ‚àí j is equal to the rank of the group of algebraic cycles of codimension j modulo numerical equivalence . 5  Like the Hodge conjecture, the Tate conjecture would imply most of Grothendieck's standard conjectures on algebraic cycles . Namely, it would imply the Lefschetz standard conjecture (that the inverse of the Lefschetz isomorphism is defined by an algebraic correspondence); that the K√ºnneth components of the diagonal are algebraic; and that numerical equivalence and homological equivalence of algebraic cycles are the same.
