   Ordinate      Ordinate   (Figure)  Illustration of a Cartesian coordinate plane. The second value in each ordered pair is the ordinate of the corresponding point.   In mathematics , ordinate most often refers to that element of an ordered pair which is plotted on the vertical axis of a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system , as opposed to the abscissa . The term can also refer to the vertical axis (typically y -axis) of a two-dimensional graph (because that axis is used to define and measure the vertical coordinates of points in the space). An ordered pair consists of two terms—the abscissa (horizontal, usually x ) and the ordinate (vertical, usually y )—which define the location of a point in two-dimensional rectangular space. 1      (    x  ⏞   abscissa   ,    y  ⏞   ordinate   )      superscript   normal-⏞  x   abscissa    superscript   normal-⏞  y   ordinate     (\overbrace{x}^{\text{abscissa}},\overbrace{y}^{\text{ordinate}})     Examples   For the red point in the above graph (−3, 1), −3 is called the abscissa and 1, the ordinate.
