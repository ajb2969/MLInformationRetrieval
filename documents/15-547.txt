Allen–Cahn equation

The Allen–Cahn equation (after John W. Cahn and Sam Allen) is a reaction-diffusion equation of mathematical physics which describes the process of phase separation in iron alloys, including order-disorder transitions.
The equation is given by:12


where 
 
 
 
  is the mobility, 
 
 
 
  is the free energy density, and 
 
 
 
  is the nonconserved order parameter.
It is the L2 gradient flow of the Ginzburg–Landau–Wilson Free Energy Functional. It is closely related to the Cahn–Hilliard equation. In one space-dimension, a very detailed account is given by a paper by Xinfu Chen.3
