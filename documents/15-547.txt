   Allen–Cahn equation      Allen–Cahn equation   The Allen–Cahn equation (after John W. Cahn and Sam Allen) is a reaction-diffusion equation of mathematical physics which describes the process of phase separation in iron alloys, including order-disorder transitions.  The equation is given by: 1 2       ∂  η    ∂  t    =    M  η    [     ϵ  η  2     ∇  2   η    -    f  ′    (  η  )     ]            η     t       subscript  M  η    delimited-[]       subscript   superscript  ϵ  2   η     superscript  normal-∇  2   η       superscript  f  normal-′   η        {{\partial\eta}\over{\partial t}}=M_{\eta}[\epsilon^{2}_{\eta}\nabla^{2}\eta-f%
 ^{\prime}(\eta)]     where    M  η     subscript  M  η    M_{\eta}   is the mobility,   f   f   f   is the free energy density, and   η   η   \eta   is the nonconserved order parameter.  It is the L2 gradient flow of the Ginzburg–Landau–Wilson Free Energy Functional. It is closely related to the Cahn–Hilliard equation . In one space-dimension, a very detailed account is given by a paper by Xinfu Chen. 3  References   http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/~wcraig/variational/node10.html    S. M. Allen and J. W.
