Green's matrix

In mathematics, and in particular ordinary differential equations, a Green's matrix helps to determine a particular solution to a first-order inhomogeneous linear system of ODEs. The concept is named after George Green.
For instance, consider 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a vector and 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
  matrix function of 
 
 
 
 , which is continuous for 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is some interval.
Now let 
 
 
 
  be 
 
 
 
  linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous equation 
 
 
 
  and arrange them in columns to form a fundamental matrix:



Now 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
  matrix solution of 
 
 
 
 .
This fundamental matrix will provide the homogeneous solution, and if added to a particular solution will give the general solution to the inhomogeneous equation.
Let 
 
 
 
  be the general solution. Now,



This implies 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is an arbitrary constant vector.
Now the general solution is 
 
 

The first term is the homogeneous solution and the second term is the particular solution.
Now define the Green's matrix 
 
 

The particular solution can now be written
