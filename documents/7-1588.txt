   Green's matrix      Green's matrix   In mathematics , and in particular ordinary differential equations , a Green's matrix helps to determine a particular solution to a first-order inhomogeneous linear system of ODEs. The concept is named after George Green .  For instance, consider     x  ′   =    A   (  t  )   x   +   g   (  t  )          superscript  x  normal-′       A  t  x     g  t      x^{\prime}=A(t)x+g(t)\,   where    x    x   x\,   is a vector and    A   (  t  )       A  t    A(t)\,   is an    n  ×   n       n  n    n\times n\,   matrix function of    t    t   t\,   , which is continuous for      t   \isin   I   ,  a   ≤  t  ≤   b            t  \isin  I   a   t       b     t\isin I,a\leq t\leq b\,   , where    I    I   I\,   is some interval.  Now let      x  1    (  t  )    ,  …  ,    x  n    (  t  )          superscript  x  1   t   normal-…     superscript  x  n   t     x^{1}(t),\ldots,x^{n}(t)\,   be    n    n   n\,   linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous equation     x  ′   =   A   (  t  )    x         superscript  x  normal-′     A  t  x     x^{\prime}=A(t)x\,   and arrange them in columns to form a fundamental matrix:        X   (  t  )    =   [    x  1    (  t  )    ,  …  ,    x  n    (  t  )    ]    .        X  t       superscript  x  1   t   normal-…     superscript  x  n   t      X(t)=\left[x^{1}(t),\ldots,x^{n}(t)\right].\,     Now    X   (  t  )       X  t    X(t)\,   is an    n  ×   n       n  n    n\times n\,   matrix solution of     X  ′   =   A   X         superscript  X  normal-′     A  X     X^{\prime}=AX\,   .  This fundamental matrix will provide the homogeneous solution, and if added to a particular solution will give the general solution to the inhomogeneous equation.  Let    x  =   X   y        x    X  y     x=Xy\,   be the general solution. Now,      x  ′     superscript  x  normal-′    \displaystyle x^{\prime}     This implies     X   y  ′    =   g         X   superscript  y  normal-′    g    Xy^{\prime}=g\,   or    y  =   c  +    ∫  a  t     X   -  1     (  s  )   g   (  s  )   d   s          y    c    superscript   subscript   a   t      superscript  X    1    s  g  s  d  s       y=c+\int_{a}^{t}X^{-1}(s)g(s)\,ds\,   where    c    c   c\,   is an arbitrary constant vector.  Now the general solution is     x  =    X   (  t  )   c   +   X   (  t  )     ∫  a  t     X   -  1     (  s  )   g   (  s  )   d  s       .      x      X  t  c     X  t    superscript   subscript   a   t      superscript  X    1    s  g  s  d  s        x=X(t)c+X(t)\int_{a}^{t}X^{-1}(s)g(s)\,ds.\,     The first term is the homogeneous solution and the second term is the particular solution.  Now define the Green's matrix      G  0    (  t  ,  s  )    =    {     0     t  ≤  s  ≤  b        X   (  t  )    X   -  1     (  s  )        a  ≤  s  <  t   .               subscript  G  0    t  s     cases  0      t  s       b      X  t   superscript  X    1    s       a  s       t       G_{0}(t,s)=\begin{cases}0&t\leq s\leq b\\
 X(t)X^{-1}(s)&a\leq s     The particular solution can now be written       x  p    (  t  )    =    ∫  a  b     G  0    (  t  ,  s  )   g   (  s  )   d  s     .         subscript  x  p   t     superscript   subscript   a   b      subscript  G  0    t  s   g  s  d  s      x_{p}(t)=\int_{a}^{b}G_{0}(t,s)g(s)\,ds.\,     External links   An example of solving an inhomogeneous system of linear ODEs and finding a Green's matrix from www.exampleproblems.com.
