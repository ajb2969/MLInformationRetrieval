Combined Linear Congruential Generator

A Combined Linear Congruential Generator (CLCG) is a pseudo-random number generator algorithm based on combining two or more linear congruential generators (LCG). A traditional LCG has a period which is inadequate for complex system simulation.1 By combining two or more LCGs, random numbers with a longer period and better statistical properties can be created.2 The algorithm is defined as:3



where:


 
  — the "modulus" of the first LCG


 
  — the ith input from the jth LCG


 
  — the ith generated random integer
with:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1.
Derivation
If Wi,1, Wi,2, ..., Wi,k are any independent, discrete, random-variables and one of them is uniformly distributed from 0 to m1 − 2, then Zi is uniformly distributed between 0 and m1 − 2, where:4



Let Xi,1, Xi,2, ..., Xi,k be outputs from k LCGs. If Wi,j is defined as Xi,j − 1, then Wi,j will be approximately uniformly distributed from 0 to mj − 1.5 The coefficient "(−1)j−1" implicitly performs the subtraction of one from Xi,j.6
Properties
The CLCG provides an efficient way to calculate pseudo-random numbers. The LCG algorithm is computationally inexpensive to use.7 The results of multiple LCG algorithms are combined through the CLCG algorithm to create pseudo-random numbers with a longer period than is achievable with the LCG method by itself.8
The period of a CLCG is dependent on the seed value used to initiate the algorithm. The maximum period of a CLCG is defined by the function:9



Example
The following is an example algorithm designed for use in 32 bit computers:10


 
  LCGs are used with the following properties:















The CLCG algorithm is setup as follows:
1. The seed for the first LCG, 
 
 
 
 , should be selected in the range of [1, 2,147,483,562].

The seed for the second LCG, 
 
 
 
 , should be selected in the range of [1, 2,147,483,398].
 
Set
 
 


2. The two LCGs are evaluated as follows:






3. The CLCG equation is solved as shown below:



4. Calculate the random number:



5. Increment the counter (i=i+1) then return to step 2 and repeat.
The maximum period of the two LCGs used is calculated using the formula:.11


 
  This equates to 2.1x109 for the two LCGs used.
This CLCG shown in this example has a maximum period of:


 
  This represents a tremendous improvement over the period of the individual LCGs. It can be seen that the combined method increases the period by 9 orders of magnitude.
Surprisingly the period of this CLCG may not be sufficient for all applications:.12 Other algorithms using the CLCG method have been used to create pseudo-random number generators with periods as long as 3x1057.131415
