   Parseval's identity      Parseval's identity   In mathematical analysis , Parseval's identity , named after Marc-Antoine Parseval , is a fundamental result on the summability of the Fourier series of a function. Geometrically, it is the Pythagorean theorem for inner-product spaces .  Informally, the identity asserts that the sum of the squares of the Fourier coefficients of a function is equal to the integral of the square of the function,         ∑   n  =   -  ∞    ∞     |   c  n   |   2    =    1   2  π      ∫   -  π   π       |   f   (  x  )    |   2    d  x      ,        superscript   subscript     n           superscript     subscript  c  n    2        1    2  π      superscript   subscript     π    π      superscript      f  x    2   d  x       \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}|c_{n}|^{2}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}|f(x)|^{2}%

More formally, the result holds as stated provided ƒ is square-integrable or, more generally, in L 2 [−π,π ]. A similar result is the Plancherel theorem , which asserts that the integral of the square of the Fourier transform of a function is equal to the integral of the square of the function itself.

Suppose that H is a Hilbert space with inner product 〈•,•〉. Let ( e n ) be an orthonormal basis of H ; i.e., the linear span of the e n is dense in H , and the e n are mutually orthonormal:       ⟨   e  m   ,   e  n   ⟩   =   {     1       if   m   =  n       0        if   m   ≠  n   .             subscript  e  m    subscript  e  n     cases  1      if  m   n   0      if  m   n      \langle e_{m},e_{n}\rangle=\begin{cases}1&\mbox{if}\ m=n\\
 0&\mbox{if}\ m\not=n.\end{cases}     Then Parseval's identity asserts that for every x ∈ H ,         ∑  n     |   ⟨  x  ,   e  n   ⟩   |   2    =    ∥  x  ∥   2    .        subscript   n    superscript     x   subscript  e  n     2     superscript   norm  x   2     \sum_{n}|\langle x,e_{n}\rangle|^{2}=\|x\|^{2}.     This is directly analogous to the Pythagorean theorem, which asserts that the sum of the squares of the components of a vector in an orthonormal basis is equal to the squared length of the vector. One can recover the Fourier series version of Parseval's identity by letting H be the Hilbert space L 2 [−π,π], and setting e n = e −i nx for  More generally, Parseval's identity holds in any inner-product space , not just separable Hilbert spaces. Thus suppose that H is an inner-product space. Let B be an orthonormal basis of H ; i.e., an orthonormal set which is total in the sense that the linear span of B is dense in H . Then         ∥  x  ∥   2   =   ⟨  x  ,  x  ⟩   =    ∑   v  ∈  B      |   ⟨  x  ,  v  ⟩   |   2     .         superscript   norm  x   2    x  x          subscript     v  B     superscript     x  v    2       \|x\|^{2}=\langle x,x\rangle=\sum_{v\in B}\left|\langle x,v\rangle\right|^{2}.     The assumption that B is total is necessary for the validity of the identity. If B is not total, then the equality in Parseval's identity must be replaced  yielding Bessel's inequality . This general form of Parseval's identity can be proved using the Riesz–Fischer theorem .  See also   Parseval's theorem   References     .   .   .
