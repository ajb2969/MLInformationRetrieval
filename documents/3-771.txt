Vector operator

A vector operator is a differential operator used in vector calculus. Vector operators are defined in terms of del, and include the gradient, divergence, and curl:









The Laplacian is



Vector operators must always come right before the scalar field or vector field on which they operate, in order to produce a result. E.g.


 
  yields the gradient of f, but


 
  is just another vector operator, which is not operating on anything.
A vector operator can operate on another vector operator, to produce a compound vector operator, as seen above in the case of the Laplacian.
