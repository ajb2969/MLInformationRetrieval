   Vector operator      Vector operator   A vector operator is a differential operator used in vector calculus . Vector operators are defined in terms of del , and include the gradient , divergence , and curl :      grad  ≡  ∇      grad  normal-∇    \operatorname{grad}\equiv\nabla         div  ≡  ∇  ⋅     fragments  div   normal-∇  normal-⋅    \operatorname{div}\ \equiv\nabla\cdot         curl  ≡  ∇  ×     fragments  curl   normal-∇     \operatorname{curl}\equiv\nabla\times     The Laplacian is       ∇  2   ≡   div  grad   ≡   ∇  ⋅  ∇          superscript  normal-∇  2    div  grad         normal-⋅  normal-∇  normal-∇      \nabla^{2}\equiv\operatorname{div}\ \operatorname{grad}\equiv\nabla\cdot\nabla     Vector operators must always come right before the scalar field or vector field on which they operate, in order to produce a result. E.g.      ∇  f     normal-∇  f    \nabla f   yields the gradient of f , but      f  ∇      f  normal-∇    f\nabla   is just another vector operator, which is not operating on anything.  A vector operator can operate on another vector operator, to produce a compound vector operator, as seen above in the case of the Laplacian.
