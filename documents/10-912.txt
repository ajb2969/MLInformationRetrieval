   Cis-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NADPH)      Cis-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NADPH)   In enzymology , a cis-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NADPH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acyl-CoA + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cis-2,3-dehydroacyl-CoA + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are cis-2,3-dehydroacyl-CoA , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:NADP+ cis-2-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include NADPH-dependent cis-enoyl-CoA reductase , reductase, cis-2-enoyl coenzyme A , cis-2-enoyl-coenzyme A reductase , and cis-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NADPH) .
