   Bloch spectrum      Bloch spectrum   The Bloch spectrum is a concept in quantum mechanics in the field of theoretical physics ; this concept addresses certain energy spectra considerations. Let H be the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation operator       H  =    -    d  2    d   x  2      +   U  α     ,      H         superscript  d  2     d   superscript  x  2       subscript  U  α      H=-\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}+U_{\alpha},     where U α is a periodic function of period α . The Bloch spectrum 1 of H is defined as the set of values E for which all the solutions of ( H − E )φ = 0 are bounded on the whole real axis . The Bloch spectrum consists of the half-line E 0 2 j −1, E 2 j ] ( j = 1, 2, ...) are omitted. These are forbidden bands (or gaps) so the ( E 2 j −2 , E 2 j −1 ) are allowed bands.
