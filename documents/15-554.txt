   Chen–Gackstatter surface      Chen–Gackstatter surface   (Figure)  The first nine Chen–Gackstatter surfaces.   In differential geometry , the Chen–Gackstatter surface family (or the Chen–Gackstatter–Thayer surface family) is a family of minimal surfaces that generalize the Enneper surface by adding handles, giving it nonzero topological genus . 1 2  They are not embedded , and have Enneper-like ends . The members    M   i  j      subscript  M    i  j     M_{ij}   of the family are indexed by the number of extra handles i and the winding number of the Enneper end; the total genus is ij and the total Gaussian curvature is    -   4  π   (   i  +  1   )   j         4  π    i  1   j     -4\pi(i+1)j   . 3 It has been shown that    M  11     subscript  M  11    M_{11}   is the only genus one orientable complete minimal surface of total curvature    -   8  π         8  π     -8\pi   . 4  It has been conjectured that continuing to add handles to the surfaces will in the limit converge to the Scherk's second surface (for j = 1) or the saddle tower family for j > 1. 5  References  External links   The Chen–Gackstatter Thayer Surfaces at the Scientific Graphics Project 1  Chen–Gackstatter Surface in the Minimal Surface Archive 2  Xah Lee's page on Chen–Gackstatter 3   "  Category:Minimal surfaces     ↩  ↩  ↩  . ↩
