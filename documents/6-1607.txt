   Character sum      Character sum   In mathematics , a character sum is a sum      Σ  χ   (  n  )       normal-Σ  χ  n    \Sigma\chi(n)\,     of values of a Dirichlet character χ modulo  N , taken over a given range of values of n . Such sums are basic in a number of questions, for example in the distribution of quadratic residues , and in particular in the classical question of finding an upper bound for the least quadratic non-residue  modulo  N . Character sums are often closely linked to exponential sums by the Gauss sums (this is like a finite Mellin transform ).  Assume χ is a nonprincipal Dirichlet character to the modulus N .  Sums over ranges  The sum taken over all residue classes mod N is then zero. This means that the cases of interest will be sums   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   over relatively short ranges, of length R M \le n  A fundamental improvement on the trivial estimate    Σ  =   O   (  N  )        normal-Σ    O  N     \Sigma=O(N)   is the Pólya–Vinogradov inequality ( George Pólya , I. M. Vinogradov , independently in 1918), stating in big O notation that       Σ  =   O   (    N    log  N    )     .      normal-Σ    O      N     N       \Sigma=O(\sqrt{N}\log N).     Assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis , Hugh Montgomery and R. C. Vaughan have shown 1 that there is the further improvement       Σ  =   O   (    N    log   log  N     )     .      normal-Σ    O      N       N        \Sigma=O(\sqrt{N}\log\log N).     Summing polynomials  Another significant type of character sum is that formed by      Σ  χ   (   F   (  n  )    )       normal-Σ  χ    F  n     \Sigma\chi(F(n))\,     for some function F , generally a polynomial . A classical result is the case of a quadratic, for example,       F   (  n  )    =   n   (   n  +  1   )          F  n     n    n  1      F(n)=n(n+1)\,     and χ a Legendre symbol . Here the sum can be evaluated (as −1), a result that is connected to the local zeta-function of a conic section .  More generally, such sums for the Jacobi symbol relate to local zeta-functions of elliptic curves and hyperelliptic curves ; this means that by means of André Weil 's results, for N = p a prime number , there are non-trivial bounds       O   (   p   )    .      O    p     O(\sqrt{p}).     The constant implicit in the notation is linear in the genus of the curve in question, and so (Legendre symbol or hyperelliptic case) can be taken as the degree of F . (More general results, for other values of N , can be obtained starting from there.)  Weil's results also led to the Burgess bound , 2 applying to give non-trivial results beyond Pólya–Vinogradov, for R a power of N greater than 1/4.  Assume the modulus N is a prime.
