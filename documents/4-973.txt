   Supermanifold      Supermanifold   In physics and mathematics , supermanifolds are generalizations of the manifold concept based on ideas coming from supersymmetry . Several definitions are in use, some of which are described below.  Physics  In physics, a supermanifold is a manifold with both bosonic and fermionic coordinates. These coordinates are usually denoted by      (  x  ,  θ  ,   θ  ¯   )     x  θ   normal-¯  θ     (x,\theta,\bar{\theta})     where x is the usual spacetime vector, and    θ    θ   \theta\,   and    θ  ¯     normal-¯  θ    \bar{\theta}   are Grassmann-valued  spinors .  Whether these extra coordinates have any physical meaning is debatable. However this formalism is very useful for writing down supersymmetric  Lagrangians .  Supermanifold: a definition  Although supermanifolds are special cases of noncommutative manifolds , the local structure of supermanifolds make them better suited to study with the tools of standard differential geometry and locally ringed spaces .  A supermanifold M of dimension (p,q) is a topological space  M with a sheaf of superalgebras , usually denoted O M or C ∞ ( M ), that is locally isomorphic to        C  ∞    (   ℝ  p   )    ⊗   Λ  ∙     (   ξ  1   ,   …   ξ  q    )    .       tensor-product     superscript  C     superscript  ℝ  p     superscript  normal-Λ  normal-∙      subscript  ξ  1     normal-…   subscript  ξ  q       C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{p})\otimes\Lambda^{\bullet}(\xi_{1},\dots\xi_{q}).     Note that the definition of a supermanifold is similar to that of a differentiable manifold , except that the model space R p has been replaced by the model superspace  R p|q .  Side comment  This is different from the alternative definition where, using a fixed Grassmann algebra generated by a countable number of generators Λ, one defines a supermanifold as a point set space using charts with the "even coordinates" taking values in the linear combination of elements of Λ with even grading and the "odd coordinates" taking values which are linear combinations of elements of Λ with odd grading. This raises the question of the physical meaning of all these Grassmann-valued variables. Many physicists claim that they have none and that they are purely formal; if this is the case, this may make the definition in the main part of the article preferable.  Properties  Unlike a regular manifold, a supermanifold is not entirely composed of a set of points. Instead, one takes the dual point of view that the structure of a supermanifold M is contained in its sheaf O M of "smooth functions". In the dual point of view, an injective map corresponds to a surjection of sheaves, and a surjective map corresponds to an injection of sheaves.  An alternative approach to the dual point of view is to use the functor of points .  If M is a supermanifold of dimension (p,q) , then the underlying space M inherits the structure of a differentiable manifold whose sheaf of smooth functions is O M /I , where I is the ideal generated by all odd functions. Thus M is called the underlying space, or the body, of M . The quotient map O M → O M /I corresponds to an injective map M → M ; thus M is a submanifold of M .  Examples   Let M be a manifold. The odd tangent bundle ΠT M is a supermanifold given by the sheaf Ω( M ) of differential forms on M .    More generally, let E → M be a vector bundle . Then Π E is a supermanifold given by the sheaf Γ(ΛE * ). In fact, Π is a functor from the category of vector bundles to the category of supermanifolds.    Lie supergroups are examples of supermanifolds.   Batchelor's theorem  Batchelor's theorem states that every supermanifold is noncanonically isomorphic to a supermanifold of the form Π E . The word "noncanonically" prevents one from concluding that supermanifolds are simply glorified vector bundles; although the functor Π maps surjectively onto the isomorphism classes of supermanifolds, it is not an equivalence of categories.  The proof of Batchelor's theorem relies in an essential way on the existence of a partition of unity , so it does not hold for complex or real-analytic supermanifolds.  Odd symplectic structures  Odd symplectic form  In many physical and geometric applications, a supermanifold comes equipped with an Grassmann-odd symplectic structure . All natural geometric objects on a supermanifold are graded. In particular, the bundle of two-forms is equipped with a grading. An odd symplectic form ω on a supermanifold is a closed, odd form, inducing a non-degenerate pairing on TM . Such a supermanifold is called a P-manifold . Its graded dimension is necessarily (n,n) , because the odd symplectic form induces a pairing of odd and even variables. There is a version of the Darboux theorem for P-manifolds, which allows one to equip a P-manifold locally with a set of coordinates where the odd symplectic form ω is written as       ω  =     ∑  i    d   ξ  i     ∧   d   x  i      ,      ω      subscript   i     d   subscript  ξ  i       d   subscript  x  i       \omega=\sum_{i}d\xi_{i}\wedge dx_{i},   where    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   are even coordinates, and    ξ  i     subscript  ξ  i    \xi_{i}   odd coordinates. (An odd symplectic form should not be confused with a Grassmann-even symplectic form on a supermanifold. In contrast, the Darboux version of an even symplectic form is          ∑  i    d   p  i     ∧   d   q  i     +    ∑  j      ε  j   2     (   d   ξ  j    )   2      ,          subscript   i     d   subscript  p  i       d   subscript  q  i       subscript   j        subscript  ε  j   2    superscript    d   subscript  ξ  j    2       \sum_{i}dp_{i}\wedge dq_{i}+\sum_{j}\frac{\varepsilon_{j}}{2}(d\xi_{j})^{2},   where     p  i   ,   q  i       subscript  p  i    subscript  q  i     p_{i},q_{i}   are even coordinates,    ξ  i     subscript  ξ  i    \xi_{i}   odd coordinates and    ε  j     subscript  ε  j    \varepsilon_{j}   are either +1 or -1.)  Antibracket  Given an odd symplectic 2-form ω one may define a Poisson bracket known as the antibracket of any two functions F and G on a supermanifold by          {  F  ,  G  }   =      ∂  r   F    ∂   z  i      ω   i  j     (  z  )      ∂  l   G    ∂   z  j       .       F  G         subscript   r   F      superscript  z  i      superscript  ω    i  j    z      subscript   l   G      superscript  z  j        \{F,G\}=\frac{\partial_{r}F}{\partial z^{i}}\omega^{ij}(z)\frac{\partial_{l}G}%
 {\partial z^{j}}.        Here    ∂  r     subscript   r    \partial_{r}   and    ∂  l     subscript   l    \partial_{l}   are the right and left derivatives respectively and z are the coordinates of the supermanifold. Equipped with this bracket, the algebra of functions on a supermanifold becomes an antibracket algebra .  A coordinate transformation that preserves the antibracket is called a P-transformation . If the Berezinian of a P-transformation is equal to one then it is called an SP-transformation .  P and SP-manifolds  Using the Darboux theorem for odd symplectic forms one can show that P-manifolds are constructed from open sets of superspaces    ℛ   n  |  n      superscript  ℛ   fragments  n  normal-|  n     {\mathcal{R}}^{n|n}   glued together by P-transformations. A manifold is said to be an SP-manifold if these transition functions can be chosen to be SP-transformations. Equivalently one may define an SP-manifold as a supermanifold with a nondegenerate odd 2-form ω and a density function ρ such that on each coordinate patch there exist Darboux coordinates in which ρ is identically equal to one.  Laplacian  One may define a Laplacian operator Δ on an SP-manifold as the operator which takes a function H to one half of the divergence of the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field . Explicitly one defines         Δ  H   =    1   2  ρ      ∂  r    ∂   z  a      (   ρ   ω   i  j     (  z  )      ∂  l   H    ∂   z  j      )          normal-Δ  H       1    2  ρ       subscript   r      superscript  z  a       ρ   superscript  ω    i  j    z      subscript   l   H      superscript  z  j         \Delta H=\frac{1}{2\rho}\frac{\partial_{r}}{\partial z^{a}}\left(\rho\omega^{%
 ij}(z)\frac{\partial_{l}H}{\partial z^{j}}\right)   .     In Darboux coordinates this definition reduces to        Δ  =     ∂  r    ∂   x  a       ∂  l    ∂   θ  a          normal-Δ       subscript   r      superscript  x  a        subscript   l      subscript  θ  a        \Delta=\frac{\partial_{r}}{\partial x^{a}}\frac{\partial_{l}}{\partial\theta_{%
 a}}        where x a and θ a are even and odd coordinates such that        ω  =    d   x  a    ∧   d   θ  a         ω      d   superscript  x  a      d   subscript  θ  a       \omega=dx^{a}\wedge d\theta_{a}   .     The Laplacian is odd and nilpotent         Δ  2   =  0       superscript  normal-Δ  2   0    \Delta^{2}=0   .     One may define the cohomology of functions H with respect to the Laplacian. In Geometry of Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization , Albert Schwarz has proven that the integral of a function H over a Lagrangian submanifold  L depends only on the cohomology class of H and on the homology class of the body of L in the body of the ambient supermanifold.  SUSY  A pre-SUSY-structure on a supermanifold of dimension (n,m) is an odd m -dimensional distribution    P  ⊂   T  M       P    T  M     P\subset TM   . With such a distribution one associates its Frobenius tensor      S  2   P   ↦    T  M   /  P      maps-to     superscript  S  2   P       T  M   P     S^{2}P\mapsto TM/P   (since P is odd, the skew-symmetric Frobenius tensor is a symmetric operation). If this tensor is non-degenerate, e.g. lies in an open orbit of      G  L   (  P  )    ×  G   L   (    T  M   /  P   )           G  L  P   G   L      T  M   P     GL(P)\times GL(TM/P)   , M is called a SUSY-manifold . SUSY-structure in dimension (1, k) is the same as odd contact structure .
