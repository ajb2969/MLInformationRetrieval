   Multivariate interpolation      Multivariate interpolation   In numerical analysis , multivariate interpolation or spatial interpolation is interpolation on functions of more than one variable.  The function to be interpolated is known at given points    (   x  i   ,   y  i   ,   z  i   ,  ‚Ä¶  )      subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i    subscript  z  i   normal-‚Ä¶    (x_{i},y_{i},z_{i},\dots)   and the interpolation problem consist of yielding values at arbitrary points    (  x  ,  y  ,  z  ,  ‚Ä¶  )     x  y  z  normal-‚Ä¶    (x,y,z,\dots)   .  Regular grid  For function values known on a regular grid (having predetermined, not necessarily uniform, spacing), the following methods are available.

Three of the methods applied on the same dataset, from 16 values located at the black dots. The colours represent the interpolated values.

Tensor product splines for N dimensions  Catmull-Rom splines can be easily generalized to any number of dimensions. The cubic Hermite spline article will remind you that      CINT  x    (   f   -  1    ,   f  0   ,   f  1   ,   f  2   )    =    ùêõ   (  x  )    ‚ãÖ   (    f   -  1     f  0    f  1    f  2    )           subscript  CINT  x     subscript  f    1     subscript  f  0    subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2      normal-‚ãÖ    ùêõ  x      subscript  f    1     subscript  f  0    subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2       \mathrm{CINT}_{x}(f_{-1},f_{0},f_{1},f_{2})=\mathbf{b}(x)\cdot\left(f_{-1}f_{0%
 }f_{1}f_{2}\right)   for some 4-vector    ùêõ   (  x  )       ùêõ  x    \mathbf{b}(x)   which is a function of x alone, where    f  j     subscript  f  j    f_{j}   is the value at   j   j   j   of the function to be interpolated. Rewrite this approximation as       CR   (  x  )    =    ‚àë   i  =   -  1    2     f  i    b  i    (  x  )           CR  x     superscript   subscript     i    1     2      subscript  f  i    subscript  b  i   x      \mathrm{CR}(x)=\sum_{i=-1}^{2}f_{i}b_{i}(x)   This formula can be directly generalized to N dimensions: 1       CR   (   x  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  N   )    =    ‚àë     i  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   i  N    =   -  1    2     f    i  1   ‚Ä¶   i  N       ‚àè   j  =  1   N     b   i  j     (   x  j   )             CR    subscript  x  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  N       superscript   subscript       subscript  i  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  i  N      1     2      subscript  f     subscript  i  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  i  N       superscript   subscript  product    j  1    N      subscript  b   subscript  i  j     subscript  x  j         \mathrm{CR}(x_{1},\dots,x_{N})=\sum_{i_{1},\dots,i_{N}=-1}^{2}f_{i_{1}\dots i_%
 {N}}\prod_{j=1}^{N}b_{i_{j}}(x_{j})   Note that similar generalizations can be made for other types of spline interpolations, including Hermite splines. In regards to efficiency, the general formula can in fact be computed as a composition of successive   CINT   CINT   \mathrm{CINT}   -type operations for any type of tensor product splines, as explained in the tricubic interpolation article. However, the fact remains that if there are   n   n   n   terms in the 1-dimensional   CR   CR   \mathrm{CR}   -like summation, then there will be    n  N     superscript  n  N    n^{N}   terms in the   N   N   N   -dimensional summation.  Irregular grid (scattered data)  Schemes defined for scattered data on an irregular grid should all work on a regular grid, typically reducing to another known method.
