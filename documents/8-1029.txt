H-derivative

In mathematics, the H-derivative is a notion of derivative in the study of abstract Wiener spaces and the Malliavin calculus.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be an abstract Wiener space, and suppose that 
 
 
 
  is differentiable. Then the Fr√©chet derivative is a map


 
 ; i.e., for 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is an element of 
 
 
 
 , the dual space to 
 
 
 
 .
Therefore, define the 

 
 -derivative

 
  at 
 
 
 
  by


 
 , a continuous linear map on 
 
 
 
 .
Define the 

 
 -gradient

 
  by


 
 . That is, if 
 
 
 
  denotes the adjoint of 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
 .
