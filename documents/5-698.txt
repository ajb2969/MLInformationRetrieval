   Counting problem (complexity)      Counting problem (complexity)   In computational complexity theory and computability theory , a counting problem is a type of computational problem . If R is a search problem then        c  R    (  x  )    =   |   {  y  ∣   R   (  x  ,  y  )    }   |          subscript  c  R   x      conditional-set  y    R   x  y        c_{R}(x)=|\{y\mid R(x,y)\}|\,     is the corresponding counting function and       #  R   =   {   (  x  ,  y  )   ∣   y  ≤    c  R    (  x  )     }         normal-#  R    conditional-set   x  y     y     subscript  c  R   x       \#R=\{(x,y)\mid y\leq c_{R}(x)\}     denotes the corresponding counting problem.  Note that c R is a search problem while # R'' is a decision problem, however c R can be C Cook reduced to #R'' (for appropriate C ) using a binary search (the reason # R is defined the way it is, rather than being the graph of ''c R'' , is to make this binary search possible).  Counting complexity class  If NC is a complexity class associated with non-deterministic machines then #C = { #R | R ∈ NC } is the set of counting problems associated with each search problem in NC . In particular, #P is the class of counting problems associated with NP search problems.  External links      "  Category:Computational problems
