   Ascorbate 2,3-dioxygenase      Ascorbate 2,3-dioxygenase   Ascorbate 2,3-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ascorbate + O 2 + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxalate + threonate   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ascorbate , oxygen , and water , whereas its two products are oxalate and threonate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is ascorbate:oxygen 2,3-oxidoreductase (bond-cleaving) . This enzyme is also called AAoxygenase . This enzyme participates in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism. It employs one cofactor , iron .  References     "  Category:EC 1.13.11  Category:Iron enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
