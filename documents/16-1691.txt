Y and H transforms

In mathematics, the 
 
 
transforms and 
 
 
transforms are complementary pairs of integral transforms involving, respectively, the Neumann function (Bessel function of the second kind)  of order 
 
 
 
  and the Struve function  of the same order.
For a given function 
 
 
 
 , the 
 
 
 
 -transform of order 
 
 
 
  is given by



The inverse of above is the 
 
 
 
 -transform of the same order; for a given function 
 
 
 
 , the 
 
 
 
 -transform of order 
 
 
 
  is given by



These transforms are closely related to the Hankel transform, as both involve Bessel functions. In problems of mathematical physics and applied mathematics, the Hankel, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  transforms all may appear in problems having axial symmetry. Hankel transforms are however much more commonly seen due to their connection with the 2-dimensional Fourier transform. The 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  transforms appear in situations with singular behaviour on the axis of symmetry (Rooney).
