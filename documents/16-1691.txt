   Y and H transforms      Y and H transforms   In mathematics, the   Y   Y   Y    transforms and   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}    transforms are complementary pairs of integral transforms involving, respectively, the Neumann function (Bessel function of the second kind) of order   ν   ν   ν   and the Struve function  of the same order.  For a given function    f   (  r  )       f  r    f(r)   , the   Y   Y   Y   -transform of order   ν   ν   ν   is given by       F   (  k  )    =    ∫  0  ∞    f   (  r  )    Y  ν    (   k  r   )      k  r     d  r          F  k     superscript   subscript   0       f  r   subscript  Y  ν     k  r       k  r    d  r      F(k)=\int_{0}^{\infty}f(r)Y_{\nu}(kr)\sqrt{kr}\,dr     The inverse of above is the   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   -transform of the same order; for a given function    F   (  k  )       F  k    F(k)   , the   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   -transform of order   ν   ν   ν   is given by       f   (  r  )    =    ∫  0  ∞    F   (  k  )    𝐇  ν    (   k  r   )      k  r     d  k          f  r     superscript   subscript   0       F  k   subscript  𝐇  ν     k  r       k  r    d  k      f(r)=\int_{0}^{\infty}F(k)\mathbf{H}_{\nu}(kr)\sqrt{kr}\,dk     These transforms are closely related to the Hankel transform , as both involve Bessel functions. In problems of mathematical physics and applied mathematics, the Hankel,   Y   Y   Y   ,   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   transforms all may appear in problems having axial symmetry . Hankel transforms are however much more commonly seen due to their connection with the 2-dimensional Fourier transform. The   Y   Y   Y   ,   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   transforms appear in situations with singular behaviour on the axis of symmetry (Rooney).
