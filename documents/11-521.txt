N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase




N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase

In enzymology, a N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

glycoprotein N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-phospho-D-mannose + H2O 
 
 
 
  N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + glycoprotein phospho-D-mannose
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glycoprotein N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-phospho-D-mannose and H2O, whereas its two products are N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and glycoprotein phospho-D-mannose.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycoprotein-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-phospho-D-mannose N-acetyl-D-glucosaminylphosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphodiesterase, lysosomal alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase, phosphodiester glycosidase, alpha-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-1-phosphodiester, N-acetylglucosaminidase, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphodiester, and acetamidodeoxyglucohydrolase.
