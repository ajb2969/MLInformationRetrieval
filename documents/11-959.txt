   Peptide alpha-N-acetyltransferase      Peptide alpha-N-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a peptide alpha-N-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + peptide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   Nalpha-acetylpeptide + CoA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and peptide , whereas its two products are Nalpha-acetylpeptide and CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:peptide Nalpha-acetyltransferase . Other names in common use include beta-endorphin acetyltransferase , peptide acetyltransferase , protein N-terminal acetyltransferase , NAT , Nalpha-acetyltransferase , amino-terminal amino acid-acetylating enzyme , and acetyl-CoA:peptide alpha-N-acetyltransferase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
