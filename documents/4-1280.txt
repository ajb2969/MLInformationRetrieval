   Double coset      Double coset   In mathematics , given a group  G and two subgroups  H and K , not necessarily distinct, a double coset (or more precisely an ( H , K ) double coset ) is a set  HgK for some fixed element g in G . Equivalently, an ( H , K ) double coset in G is an equivalence class for the equivalence relation defined on G by   x ~ y if there are h in H and k in K with hxk = y .   The basic properties of double cosets follow immediately from the fact that they are equivalence classes; namely, two double cosets HxK and HyK are either disjoint or identical 1 and G is partitioned into its ( H , K ) double cosets. 2  Furthermore, each double coset HgK is a union of ordinary right cosets  Hy of H in G and left cosets zK of K in G . In particular, the number of right cosets of H in HgK is the index [ K : K ∩ g -1 Hg ] and the number of left cosets of K in HgK is the index [ g -1 Hg : K ∩ g -1 Hg ]. 3  Double cosets are in fact orbits for the group action of H × K on G with H acting by left multiplication and K by inverse right multiplication. The set of double cosets is often denoted by        H  \  G   /  K   .       normal-\  H  G   K    H\backslash G/K.     Algebraic structure  It is possible to define a product operation of double cosets in an associated ring.  Given two double cosets    H   g  1   K      H   subscript  g  1   K    Hg_{1}K   and    K   g  2   L      K   subscript  g  2   L    Kg_{2}L   , we decompose each into right cosets     H   g  1   K   =    ∐  i    H   a  i           H   subscript  g  1   K     subscript  coproduct  i     H   subscript  a  i       \textstyle Hg_{1}K=\coprod_{i}Ha_{i}   and     K   g  2   L   =    ∐  j     b  j   L          K   subscript  g  2   L     subscript  coproduct  j      subscript  b  j   L      \textstyle Kg_{2}L=\coprod_{j}b_{j}L   . If we write     c  g   =   |   {   (  i  ,  j  )   :     a  i    b  j    ∈   H  g    }   |        subscript  c  g      conditional-set   i  j        subscript  a  i    subscript  b  j      H  g        c_{g}=\left|\{(i,j):a_{i}b_{j}\in Hg\}\right|   , then we can define the product of    H   g  1   K      H   subscript  g  1   K    Hg_{1}K   with    K   g  2   L      K   subscript  g  2   L    Kg_{2}L   as the formal sum       H   g  1   K   ⋅  K    g  2   L   =    ∑   g  ∈   H  \  G       c  g   H  g  L           normal-⋅    H   subscript  g  1   K   K    subscript  g  2   L     subscript     g   normal-\  H  G        subscript  c  g   H  g  L      \textstyle Hg_{1}K\cdot Kg_{2}L=\sum_{g\in H\backslash G}c_{g}HgL   .  An important case is when H = K = L , which allows us to define an algebra structure on the associated ring spanned by linear combinations of double cosets.  Applications  Double cosets are important in connection with representation theory , when a representation of H is used to construct an induced representation of G , which is then restricted to K . The corresponding double coset structure carries information about how the resulting representation decomposes.  They are also important in functional analysis , where in some important cases functions left-invariant and right-invariant by a subgroup K can form a commutative ring under convolution : see Gelfand pair .  In geometry, a Clifford–Klein form is a double coset space Γ \ G / H , where G is a reductive Lie group , H is a closed subgroup, and Γ is a discrete subgroup (of G ) that acts properly discontinuously on the homogeneous space  G / H .  In number theory , the Hecke algebra corresponding to a congruence subgroup  Γ of the modular group is spanned by elements of the double coset space      Γ  \   GL  2  +     (  ℚ  )    /  Γ         normal-\  normal-Γ   superscript   subscript  GL  2      ℚ   normal-Γ    \Gamma\backslash\mathrm{GL}_{2}^{+}(\mathbb{Q})/\Gamma   ; the algebra structure is that acquired from the multiplication of double cosets described above. Of particular importance are the Hecke operators    T  m     subscript  T  m    T_{m}   corresponding to the double cosets     Γ  0    (  N  )   g   Γ  0    (  N  )        subscript  normal-Γ  0   N  g   subscript  normal-Γ  0   N    \Gamma_{0}(N)g\Gamma_{0}(N)   or     Γ  1    (  N  )   g   Γ  1    (  N  )        subscript  normal-Γ  1   N  g   subscript  normal-Γ  1   N    \Gamma_{1}(N)g\Gamma_{1}(N)   , where    g  =   (     1    0      0    m     )       g    1  0    0  m      g=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1&0\\
 0&m\end{smallmatrix}\right)   (these have different properties depending on whether m and N are coprime or not), and the diamond operators    ⟨  d  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  d    \langle d\rangle   given by the double cosets     Γ  1    (  N  )    (     a    b      c    d     )    Γ  1    (  N  )        subscript  normal-Γ  1   N    a  b    c  d     subscript  normal-Γ  1   N    \Gamma_{1}(N)\left(\begin{smallmatrix}a&b\\
 c&d\end{smallmatrix}\right)\Gamma_{1}(N)   where    d  ∈    (    ℤ  /  N   ℤ   )   ×       d   superscript      ℤ  N   ℤ       d\in(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^{\times}   and we require     (     a    b      c    d     )   ∈    Γ  0    (  N  )          a  b    c  d       subscript  normal-Γ  0   N     \left(\begin{smallmatrix}a&b\\
 c&d\end{smallmatrix}\right)\in\Gamma_{0}(N)   (the choice of a , b , c does not affect the answer).  References  "  Category:Group theory     ↩  ↩
