<p>An <strong>optical coating</strong> is one or more <a href="thin-film_optics" title="wikilink">thin layers</a> of material deposited on an optical component such as a <a href="lens_(optics)" title="wikilink">lens</a> or <a class="uri" href="mirror" title="wikilink">mirror</a>, which alters the way in which the optic <a href="Reflection_(physics)" title="wikilink">reflects</a> and <a href="transmission_(telecommunications)" title="wikilink">transmits</a> light. One type of optical coating is an <a href="Anti-reflective_coating" title="wikilink">antireflection coating</a>, which reduces unwanted reflections from surfaces, and is commonly used on <a href="glasses" title="wikilink">spectacle</a> and <a href="photographic_lens" title="wikilink">photographic lenses</a>. Another type is the <strong>high-reflector coating</strong> which can be used to produce mirrors which reflect greater than 99.99% of the light which falls on them. More complex optical coatings exhibit high reflection over some range of <a href="wavelength" title="wikilink">wavelengths</a>, and anti-reflection over another range, allowing the production of <a href="dichroism" title="wikilink">dichroic</a> <a href="thin-film_optical_filters" title="wikilink">thin-film optical filters</a>.</p>

<p>The simplest optical coatings are thin layers of <a href="metal" title="wikilink">metals</a>, such as <a class="uri" href="aluminium" title="wikilink">aluminium</a>, which are deposited on glass substrates to make mirror surfaces, a process known as <a class="uri" href="silvering" title="wikilink">silvering</a>. The metal used determines the reflection characteristics of the mirror; aluminium is the cheapest and most common coating, and yields a reflectivity of around 88%-92% over the <a href="visible_spectrum" title="wikilink">visible spectrum</a>. More expensive is <a class="uri" href="silver" title="wikilink">silver</a>, which has a reflectivity of 95%-99% even into the far <a class="uri" href="infrared" title="wikilink">infrared</a>, but suffers from decreasing reflectivity (</p>
<h3 id="antireflection-coatings">Antireflection coatings</h3>

<p> Antireflection coatings are used to reduce reflection from surfaces. Whenever a <a href="ray_(optics)" title="wikilink">ray</a> of light moves from one <a href="Medium_(optics)" title="wikilink">medium</a> to another (such as when light enters a sheet of <a class="uri" href="glass" title="wikilink">glass</a> after travelling through <a class="uri" href="air" title="wikilink">air</a>), some portion of the light is reflected from the surface (known as the <em>interface</em>) between the two media.</p>

<p>A number of different effects are used to reduce reflection. The simplest is to use a thin layer of material at the interface, with an index of refraction between those of the two media. The reflection is minimized when</p>

 are the indices of the two media. The optimum refractive indices for multiple coating layers at angles of incidence other than 0° is given by Moreno et al. (2005).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Such coatings can reduce the reflection for ordinary glass from about 4% per surface to around 2%. These were the first type of antireflection coating known, having been discovered by <a href="John_William_Strutt,_3rd_Baron_Rayleigh" title="wikilink">Lord Rayleigh</a> in 1886. He found that old, slightly tarnished pieces of glass transmitted more light than new, clean pieces due to this effect.</p>

<p>Practical antireflection coatings rely on an intermediate layer not only for its direct reduction of reflection coefficient, but also use the <a href="Interference_(wave_propagation)" title="wikilink">interference</a> effect of a thin layer. If the layer's thickness is controlled precisely such that it is exactly one-quarter of the wavelength of the light (a <em>quarter-wave coating</em>), the reflections from the front and back sides of the thin layer will destructively interfere and cancel each other.</p>

<p> In practice, the performance of a simple one-layer interference coating is limited by the fact that the reflections only exactly cancel for one wavelength of light at one angle, and by difficulties finding suitable materials. For ordinary glass (<em>n</em>≈1.5), the optimum coating index is <em>n</em>≈1.23. Few useful substances have the required refractive index. <a href="Magnesium_fluoride" title="wikilink">Magnesium fluoride</a> (MgF<sub>2</sub>) is often used, since it is hard-wearing and can be easily applied to substrates using <a href="physical_vapor_deposition" title="wikilink">physical vapour deposition</a>, even though its index is higher than desirable (n=1.38). With such coatings, reflection as low as 1% can be achieved on common glass, and better results can be obtained on higher index media.</p>

<p>Further reduction is possible by using multiple coating layers, designed such that reflections from the surfaces undergo maximum destructive interference. By using two or more layers, broadband antireflection coatings which cover the visible range (400-700 nm) with maximum reflectivities of less than 0.5% are commonly achievable. Reflection in narrower wavelength bands can be as low as 0.1%. Alternatively, a series of layers with small differences in refractive index can be used to create a broadband antireflective coating by means of a <a href="gradient-index_optics" title="wikilink">refractive index gradient</a>.</p>
<h3 id="high-reflection-coatings">High-reflection coatings</h3>

<p>High-reflection (HR) coatings work the opposite way to antireflection coatings. The general idea is usually based on the periodic layer system composed from two materials, one with a high index, such as <a href="zinc_sulfide" title="wikilink">zinc sulfide</a> (<em>n</em>=2.32) or <a href="titanium_dioxide" title="wikilink">titanium dioxide</a> (<em>n</em>=2.4) and low index material, such as <a href="magnesium_fluoride" title="wikilink">magnesium fluoride</a> (<em>n</em>=1.38) or <a href="silicon_dioxide" title="wikilink">silicon dioxide</a> (<em>n</em>=1.49). This periodic system significantly enhances the reflectivity of the surface in the certain wavelength range called <a class="uri" href="band-stop" title="wikilink">band-stop</a>, whose width is determined by the ratio of the two used indices only (for quarter-wave system), while the maximum reflectivity is increasing nearly up to 100% with a number of layers in the <em>stack</em>. The thicknesses of the layers are generally quarter-wave (then they yield to the broadest high reflection band in compare to the non-quarter-wave systems composed from the same materials), this time designed such that reflected beams <em>constructively</em> interfere with one another to maximize reflection and minimize transmission. The best of these coatings built-up from deposited dielectric lossless materials on the perfect smooth surfaces can reach reflectivities greater than 99.999% (over a fairly narrow range of wavelengths). Common HR coatings can achieve 99.9% reflectivity over a broad wavelength range (tens of nanometers in the visible spectrum range).</p>

<p>As for AR coatings, HR coatings are affected by the incidence angle of the light. When used away from normal incidence, the reflective range shifts to shorter wavelengths, and becomes polarization dependent. This effect can be exploited to produce coatings that polarize a light beam.</p>

<p>By manipulating the exact thickness and composition of the layers in the reflective stack, the reflection characteristics can be tuned to a particular application, and may incorporate both high-reflective and anti-reflective wavelength regions. The coating can be designed as a long- or short-pass filter, a bandpass or notch filter, or a mirror with a specific reflectivity (useful in lasers). For example, the <a href="dichroic_prism" title="wikilink">dichroic prism</a> assembly used in some <a href="camera" title="wikilink">cameras</a> requires two dielectric coatings, one long-wavelength pass filter reflecting light below 500 nm (to separate the blue component of the light), and one short-pass filter to reflect red light, above 600 nm wavelength. The remaining transmitted light is the green component.</p>
<h4 id="extreme-ultraviolet-coatings">Extreme ultraviolet coatings</h4>

<p>In the <a href="ultraviolet" title="wikilink">EUV</a> portion of the spectrum (wavelengths shorter than about 30 nm) nearly all materials absorb strongly, making it difficult to focus or otherwise manipulate light in this wavelength range. Telescopes such as <a class="uri" href="TRACE" title="wikilink">TRACE</a> or <a href="Extreme_ultraviolet_Imaging_Telescope" title="wikilink">EIT</a> that form images with EUV light use multilayer mirrors that are constructed of hundreds of alternating layers of a high-mass metal such as <a class="uri" href="molybdenum" title="wikilink">molybdenum</a> or <a class="uri" href="tungsten" title="wikilink">tungsten</a>, and a low-mass spacer such as <a class="uri" href="silicon" title="wikilink">silicon</a>, <a href="vacuum_deposition" title="wikilink">vacuum deposited</a> onto a substrate such as <a class="uri" href="glass" title="wikilink">glass</a>. Each layer pair is designed to have a thickness equal to half the wavelength of light to be reflected. <a href="Constructive_interference" title="wikilink">Constructive interference</a> between scattered light from each layer causes the mirror to reflect EUV light of the desired wavelength as would a normal metal mirror in visible light. Using multilayer optics it is possible to reflect up to 70% of incident EUV light (at a particular wavelength chosen when the mirror is constructed).</p>
<h3 id="transparent-conductive-coatings">Transparent conductive coatings</h3>

<p>Transparent <a href="electrical_conduction" title="wikilink">conductive</a> coatings are used in applications where it is important that the coating conduct electricity or dissipate <a href="static_electricity" title="wikilink">static charge</a>. Conductive coatings are used to protect the aperture from <a href="electromagnetic_Interference" title="wikilink">electromagnetic Interference</a>, while dissipative coatings are used to prevent the build-up of <a href="static_electricity" title="wikilink">static electricity</a>. Transparent conductive coatings are also used extensively to provide electrodes in situations where light is required to pass, for example in <a href="flat_panel_display" title="wikilink">flat panel display</a> technologies and in many <a href="photoelectrochemistry" title="wikilink">photoelectrochemical</a> experiments. A common substance used in transparent conductive coatings is <a href="indium_tin_oxide" title="wikilink">indium tin oxide</a> (ITO). ITO is not very optically transparent, however. The layers must be thin to provide substantial transparency, particularly at the blue end of the spectrum. Using ITO, <a href="sheet_resistance" title="wikilink">sheet resistances</a> of 20 to 10,000 <a href="ohms_per_square" title="wikilink">ohms per square</a> can be achieved. An ITO coating may be combined with an antireflective coating to further improve <a class="uri" href="transmittance" title="wikilink">transmittance</a>. Other TCOs (Transparent Conductive Oxides) include AZO (Aluminium doped Zinc Oxide), which offers much better UV transmission than ITO. A special class of transparent conductive coatings applies to infrared films for theater-air military optics where IR transparent windows need to have (<a class="uri" href="Radar" title="wikilink">Radar</a>) stealth (<a href="Stealth_technology" title="wikilink">Stealth technology</a>) properties. These are known as RAITs (Radar Attenuating / Infrared Transmitting) and include materials such as boron doped DLC (<a href="Diamond-like_carbon" title="wikilink">Diamond-like carbon</a>).</p>
