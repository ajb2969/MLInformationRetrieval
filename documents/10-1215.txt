   Hexose oxidase      Hexose oxidase   In enzymology , a hexose oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-glucose + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucono-1,5-lactone + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-glucose and O 2 , whereas its two products are D-glucono-1,5-lactone and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-hexose:oxygen 1-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway . It employs one cofactor , copper .
