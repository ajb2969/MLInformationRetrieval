   Copeland–Erdős constant      Copeland–Erdős constant   The Copeland–Erdős constant is the concatenation of "0." with the base 10 representations of the prime numbers in order. Its value is approximately   0.235711131719232931374143… .   The constant is irrational; this can be proven with Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions or Bertrand's postulate (Hardy and Wright, p. 113) or Ramare's theorem that every even integer is a sum of at most six primes. It also follows directly from its normality (see below).  By a similar argument, any constant created by concatenating "0." with all primes in an arithmetic progression  dn + a , where a is coprime to d and to 10, will be irrational. E.g. primes of the form 4 n + 1 or 8 n + 1. By Dirichlet's theorem, the arithmetic progression dn ·10 m + a contains primes for all m , and those primes are also in cd + a , so the concatenated primes contain arbitrarily long sequences of the digit zero.  In base 10, the constant is a normal number , a fact proven by Arthur Herbert Copeland and Paul Erdős in 1946 (hence the name of the constant).  The constant is given by       ∑   n  =  1   ∞     p  n    10   -   (   n  +     ∑   k  =  1   n     ⌊    log  10    p  k    ⌋     )          superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  p  n    superscript  10      n    superscript   subscript     k  1    n       subscript   10    subscript  p  k            \displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}p_{n}10^{-\left(n+\sum_{k=1}^{n}\lfloor\log_{1%
 0}{p_{k}}\rfloor\right)}     where p n is the n th prime number .  Its continued fraction is [0; 4, 4, 8, 16, 18, 5, 1, …] ().  Related constants  In any given base b the number        ∑   n  =  1   ∞    b   -   p  n      ,      superscript   subscript     n  1       superscript  b     subscript  p  n       \displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b^{-p_{n}},\,     which can be written in base b as 0.0110101000101000101… b where the n th digit is 1 if n is prime, is irrational.
