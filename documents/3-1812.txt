   Dependency ratio      Dependency ratio   In economics , geography and demography the dependency ratio is an age-population ratio of those typically not in the labor force (the dependent part) and those typically in the labor force (the productive part). It is used to measure the pressure on productive population.  Formula  In published international statistics, the dependent part usually includes those under the age of 15 and over the age of 64.The productive part makes up the population in between, ages 15 – 64. It is normally expressed as a percentage:        (   T  o  t  a  l   )   D  e  p  e  n  d  e  n  c   y   r  a  t  i  o   =     (    n  u  m  b  e   r   o   f   p  e  o  p  l   e   a  g  e  d  0   -    14   a  n   d   t  h  o  s   e   a  g  e  d   65   a  n   d   o  v  e  r    )     n  u  m  b  e   r   o   f   p  e  o  p  l   e   a  g  e  d  15   -  64    ×  100           T  o  t  a  l   D  e  p  e  n  d  e  n  c  y  r  a  t  i  o           n  u  m  b  e  r  o  f  p  e  o  p  l  e  a  g  e  d  0     14  a  n  d  t  h  o  s  e  a  g  e  d  65  a  n  d  o  v  e  r        n  u  m  b  e  r  o  f  p  e  o  p  l  e  a  g  e  d  15   64    100     (Total)\ Dependency\ ratio=\frac{(number\ of\ people\ aged\ 0-14\ and\ those\ %
 aged\ 65\ and\ over)}{number\ of\ people\ aged\ 15-64}\times 100     As the ratio increases there may be an increased burden on the productive part of the population to maintain the upbringing and pensions of the economically dependent. This results in direct impacts on financial expenditures on things like social security , as well as many indirect consequences.  The (total) dependency ratio can be decomposed into the child dependency ratio and the aged dependency ratio: 1       C  h  i  l   d   d  e  p  e  n  d  e  n  c   y   r  a  t  i   o    =      n  u  m  b  e   r   o   f   p  e  o  p  l   e   a  g  e  d  0   -  14     n  u  m  b  e   r   o   f   p  e  o  p  l   e   a  g  e  d  15   -  64    ×  100         C  h  i  l  d  d  e  p  e  n  d  e  n  c  y  r  a  t  i  o           n  u  m  b  e  r  o  f  p  e  o  p  l  e  a  g  e  d  0   14       n  u  m  b  e  r  o  f  p  e  o  p  l  e  a  g  e  d  15   64    100     Child\ dependency\ ratio\ =\frac{number\ of\ people\ aged\ 0-14}{number\ of\ %

The fewer people of working age, the fewer the people who can support schools , retirement pensions , disability pensions and other assistances to the youngest and oldest members of a population, often considered the most vulnerable members of society .  Nevertheless, the dependency ratio ignores the fact that the 65+ are not necessarily dependent (an increasing proportion of them is working) and that many of those of 'working age' are actually not working. Alternatives have been developed', such as the 'economic dependency ratio', but they still ignore factors such as increases in productivity and in working hours. Worries about increasing (demographic) dependency ratio should thus be taken with caution. 4  Migrant Labor Dependency Ratio  Migrant Labor Dependency Ratio (MLDR) is used to describe the extent to which the domestic population is dependent upon migrant labor. 5 6  See also   Demographic economics  Economic collapse  Employment-to-population ratio  Generational accounting  Pensions crisis  Sub-replacement fertility  Societal collapse   Case studies:   Aging of Europe  Aging of Japan   References    External links   Old Age dependency Ratios in Europe  Definition and Forecasts for Dependency Ratios  The Risk Pool , Malcolm Gladwell, The New Yorker, 8/23/2006   "  Category:Demography  Category:Demographic economics  Category:Economic problems  Category:Retirement  Category:Ageing  Category:Public finance  Category:Government finances  Category:Government budgets     Association of Public Health Epidemiologists in Ontario ↩   http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.DPND.OL/countries?display=map ↩  http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/pubdocs/2012/59/en/2/EF1259EN.pdf ↩  http://rspas.anu.edu.au/~athu/Journal%20Papers/International%20labou%2006.pdf ↩  ↩
