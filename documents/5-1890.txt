Torricelli's equation

In physics, Torricelli's equation is an equation created by Evangelista Torricelli to find the final velocity of an object moving with a constant acceleration without having a known time interval.
The equation itself is:



where



 
  is the object's final velocity


 
  is the object's initial velocity


 
 
  is the object's acceleration


 
  is the object's change in position

Derivation
Begin with the equation for velocity:



Square both sides to get:



The term 
 
 
 
  appears in the equation for displacement, and can be isolated:









Substituting this back into our original equation yields:
