   Symplectic matrix      Symplectic matrix   In mathematics, a symplectic matrix is a 2 n √ó2 n  matrix  M with real entries that satisfies the condition  where M T denotes the transpose of M and Œ© is a fixed 2 n √ó2 n  nonsingular , skew-symmetric matrix . This definition can be extended to 2 n √ó2 n matrices with entries in other fields , e.g. the complex numbers .  Typically Œ© is chosen to be the block matrix      Œ©  =   [     0     I  n        -   I  n      0     ]       normal-Œ©    0   subscript  I  n        subscript  I  n    0      \Omega=\begin{bmatrix}0&I_{n}\\
 -I_{n}&0\\
 \end{bmatrix}   where I n is the n √ó n  identity matrix . The matrix Œ© has determinant +1 and has an inverse given by Œ© ‚àí1 = Œ© T = ‚àíŒ©.  Every symplectic matrix has unit determinant, and the 2 n √ó2 n symplectic matrices with real entries form a subgroup of the special linear group SL(2 n , R ) under matrix multiplication , specifically a connected  noncompact  real Lie group of real dimension , the symplectic group Sp(2 n , R ). The symplectic group can be defined as the set of linear transformations that preserve the symplectic form of a real symplectic vector space .  An example of a group of symplectic matrices is the group of three symplectic 2x2-matrices consisting in the identity matrix, the upper triagonal matrix and the lower triangular matrix, each with entries 0 and 1 .  Properties  Every symplectic matrix is invertible with the inverse matrix given by        M   -  1    =    Œ©   -  1     M  T   Œ©    .       superscript  M    1       superscript  normal-Œ©    1     superscript  M  T   normal-Œ©     M^{-1}=\Omega^{-1}M^{\text{T}}\Omega.   Furthermore, the product of two symplectic matrices is, again, a symplectic matrix. This gives the set of all symplectic matrices the structure of a group . There exists a natural manifold structure on this group which makes it into a (real or complex) Lie group called the symplectic group . The symplectic group has dimension n (2 n + 1).  It follows easily from the definition that the determinant of any symplectic matrix is ¬±1. Actually, it turns out that the determinant is always +1. One way to see this is through the use of the Pfaffian and the identity        Pf   (    M  T   Œ©  M   )    =   det    (  M  )   Pf   (  Œ©  )      .        Pf     superscript  M  T   normal-Œ©  M        M  Pf  normal-Œ©      \mbox{Pf}(M^{\text{T}}\Omega M)=\det(M)\mbox{Pf}(\Omega).   Since      M  T   Œ©  M   =  Œ©         superscript  M  T   normal-Œ©  M   normal-Œ©    M^{\text{T}}\Omega M=\Omega   and     Pf   (  Œ©  )    ‚â†  0        Pf  normal-Œ©   0    \mbox{Pf}(\Omega)\neq 0   we have that det( M ) = 1.  Suppose Œ© is given in the standard form and let M be a 2 n √ó2 n  block matrix given by      M  =   (     A    B      C    D     )       M    A  B    C  D      M=\begin{pmatrix}A&B\\
 C&D\end{pmatrix}   where A , B , C , D are n √ó n matrices. The condition for M to be symplectic is equivalent to the conditions         A  T   D   -    C  T   B    =  I           superscript  A  T   D      superscript  C  T   B    I    A^{\text{T}}D-C^{\text{T}}B=I           A  T   C   =    C  T   A          superscript  A  T   C      superscript  C  T   A     A^{\text{T}}C=C^{\text{T}}A            D  T   B   =    B  T   D    .         superscript  D  T   B      superscript  B  T   D     D^{\text{T}}B=B^{\text{T}}D.     When n = 1 these conditions reduce to the single condition det( M ) = 1. Thus a 2√ó2 matrix is symplectic iff it has unit determinant.  With Œ© in standard form, the inverse of M is given by        M   -  1    =    Œ©   -  1     M  T   Œ©   =   (      D  T      -   B  T         -   C  T       A  T      )    .         superscript  M    1       superscript  normal-Œ©    1     superscript  M  T   normal-Œ©           superscript  D  T      superscript  B  T         superscript  C  T     superscript  A  T        M^{-1}=\Omega^{-1}M^{\text{T}}\Omega=\begin{pmatrix}D^{\text{T}}&-B^{\text{T}}%
 \\
 -C^{\text{T}}&A^{\text{T}}\end{pmatrix}.     Symplectic transformations  In the abstract formulation of linear algebra , matrices are replaced with linear transformations of finite-dimensional  vector spaces . The abstract analog of a symplectic matrix is a symplectic transformation of a symplectic vector space . Briefly, a symplectic vector space is a 2 n -dimensional vector space V equipped with a nondegenerate , skew-symmetric  bilinear form œâ called the symplectic form .  A symplectic transformation is then a linear transformation L : V ‚Üí V which preserves œâ, i.e.        œâ   (   L  u   ,   L  v   )    =   œâ   (  u  ,  v  )     .        œâ     L  u     L  v       œâ   u  v      \omega(Lu,Lv)=\omega(u,v).   Fixing a basis for V , œâ can be written as a matrix Œ© and L as a matrix M . The condition that L be a symplectic transformation is precisely the condition that M be a symplectic matrix:         M  T   Œ©  M   =  Œ©   .         superscript  M  T   normal-Œ©  M   normal-Œ©    M^{\text{T}}\Omega M=\Omega.     Under a change of basis , represented by a matrix A , we have      Œ©  ‚Ü¶    A  T   Œ©  A      maps-to  normal-Œ©     superscript  A  T   normal-Œ©  A     \Omega\mapsto A^{\text{T}}\Omega A          M  ‚Ü¶    A   -  1    M  A    .     maps-to  M     superscript  A    1    M  A     M\mapsto A^{-1}MA.   One can always bring Œ© to either the standard form given in the introduction or the block diagonal form described below by a suitable choice of A .  The matrix Œ©  Symplectic matrices are defined relative to a fixed nonsingular , skew-symmetric matrix Œ©. As explained in the previous section, Œ© can be thought of as the coordinate representation of a nondegenerate  skew-symmetric bilinear form . It is a basic result in linear algebra that any two such matrices differ from each other by a change of basis .  The most common alternative to the standard Œ© given above is the block diagonal form       Œ©  =   [        0    1       -  1     0          0         ‚ã±         0          0    1       -  1     0        ]    .      normal-Œ©      0  1      1   0    absent  0    absent  normal-‚ã±  absent    0  absent    0  1      1   0        \Omega=\begin{bmatrix}\begin{matrix}0&1\\
 -1&0\end{matrix}&&0\\
 &\ddots&\\
 0&&\begin{matrix}0&1\\
 -1&0\end{matrix}\end{bmatrix}.   This choice differs from the previous one by a permutation of basis vectors.  Sometimes the notation J is used instead of Œ© for the skew-symmetric matrix. This is a particularly unfortunate choice as it leads to confusion with the notion of a complex structure , which often has the same coordinate expression as Œ© but represents a very different structure. A complex structure J is the coordinate representation of a linear transformation that squares to ‚àí1, whereas Œ© is the coordinate representation of a nondegenerate skew-symmetric bilinear form. One could easily choose bases in which J is not skew-symmetric or Œ© does not square to ‚àí1.  Given a hermitian structure on a vector space, J and Œ© are related via       Œ©   a  b    =   -    g   a  c     J   c  b           subscript  normal-Œ©    a  b         subscript  g    a  c     subscript   superscript  J  c   b       \Omega_{ab}=-g_{ac}{J^{c}}_{b}   where    g   a  c      subscript  g    a  c     g_{ac}   is the metric . That J and Œ© usually have the same coordinate expression (up to an overall sign) is simply a consequence of the fact that the metric g is usually the identity matrix.  Diagonalisation and decomposition   For any positive definite real symplectic matrix   S   S   S   there exists   U   U   U   in    U   (   2  n   ,  ùêë  )       U     2  n   ùêë     U(2n,\mathbf{R})   such that         S  =     U  T   D  U   for     D  =   diag   (   Œª  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   Œª  n   ,   Œª  1   -  1    ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   Œª  n   -  1    )      ,     formulae-sequence    S      superscript  U  T   D  U   for      D   diag   subscript  Œª  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  Œª  n    superscript   subscript  Œª  1     1    normal-‚Ä¶   superscript   subscript  Œª  n     1        S=U^{\text{T}}DU\quad\text{for}\quad D=\operatorname{diag}(\lambda_{1},\ldots,%
 \lambda_{n},\lambda_{1}^{-1},\ldots,\lambda_{n}^{-1}),    where the diagonal elements of   D   D   D   are the eigenvalues of   S   S   S   . 1   Any real symplectic matrix   S   S   S   has a polar decomposition 2 of the form:         S  =    U  R   for     U  ‚àà    U   (   2  n   ,  ‚Ñù  )    and  R   ‚àà    Sp   (   2  n   ,  ‚Ñù  )    ‚à©    Sym  +    (   2  n   ,  ‚Ñù  )       .     formulae-sequence    S     U  R   for        U     normal-U    2  n   ‚Ñù   and  R           Sp    2  n   ‚Ñù     subscript  Sym      2  n   ‚Ñù        S=UR\quad\text{for}\quad U\in\operatorname{U}(2n,\mathbb{R})\text{ and }R\in%
 \operatorname{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R})\cap\operatorname{Sym}_{+}(2n,\mathbb{R}).      Any real symplectic matrix can be decomposed as a product of three matrices:        S  =   O   (     D    0      0     D   -  1       )    O  ‚Ä≤     ,      S    O    D  0    0   superscript  D    1       superscript  O  normal-‚Ä≤      S=O\begin{pmatrix}D&0\\
 0&D^{-1}\end{pmatrix}O^{\prime},    such that   O   O   O   and   O   O   O   are both symplectic and orthogonal and   D   D   D   is positive-definite and diagonal . 3 This decomposition is closely related to the singular value decomposition of a matrix. It is known as an 'Euler' or 'Bloch-Messiah' decomposition and has an intuitive link with the Euler decomposition of a rotation .  Complex matrices  If instead M is a 2n √ó 2n  matrix with complex entries, the definition is not standard throughout the literature. Many authors 4 adjust the definition above to where M * denotes the conjugate transpose of M . In this case, the determinant may not be 1, but will have absolute value 1. In the 2√ó2 case ( n =1), M will be the product of a real symplectic matrix and a complex number of absolute value 1.  Other authors 5 retain the definition () for complex matrices and call matrices satisfying () conjugate symplectic .
