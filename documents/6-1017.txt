Sigma model

In physics, a sigma model is a physical system that is described by a Lagrangian density of the form:



Depending on the scalars in , it is either a linear sigma model or a non-linear sigma model. The fields , in general, provide a map from a base manifold called the worldsheet to a target (Riemannian) manifold of the scalars linked together by internal symmetries. (In string theory, however, that is often understood to be the actual spacetime.)
The sigma model was introduced by ; the name σ-model comes from a field in their model corresponding to a spinless meson called 
 
 
 
 , a scalar introduced earlier by Schwinger. The model served as the dominant prototype of spontaneous symmetry breaking of O(4) down to O(3): the three axial generators broken are the simplest manifestation of chiral symmetry breaking, the surviving unbroken O(3) representing isospin.
A basic example is provided by quantum mechanics which is a quantum field theory in one dimension. It's a sigma model with a base manifold given by the real line parameterizing the time (or an interval, or the circle, etc.) and a target space that is the real line.
The model may be augmented by a torsion term to yield the more interesting Wess–Zumino–Witten model.
