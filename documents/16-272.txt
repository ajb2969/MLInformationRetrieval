(2,2,3-trimethyl-5-oxocyclopent-3-enyl)acetyl-CoA synthase

(2,2,3-trimethyl-5-oxocyclopent-3-enyl)acetyl-CoA synthase (, 2-oxo-Delta3-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetyl-CoA synthetase) is an enzyme with system name ((1R)-2,2,3-trimethyl-5-oxocyclopent-3-enyl)acetate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

[(1R)-2,2,3-trimethyl-5-oxocyclopent-3-enyl]acetate + ATP + CoA 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + [(1R)-2,2,3-trimethyl-5-oxocyclopent-3-enyl]acetyl-CoA
 

This enzyme is isolated from Pseudomonas putida.
