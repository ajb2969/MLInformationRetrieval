   Malliavin's absolute continuity lemma      Malliavin's absolute continuity lemma   In mathematics — specifically, in measure theory — Malliavin's absolute continuity lemma is a result due to the French  mathematician  Paul Malliavin that plays a foundational rôle in the regularity ( smoothness ) theorems of the Malliavin calculus . Malliavin's lemma gives a sufficient condition for a finite  Borel measure to be absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure .  Statement of the lemma  Let μ be a finite Borel measure on n - dimensional  Euclidean space  R n . Suppose that, for every x ∈ R n , there exists a constant C = C ( x ) such that       |    ∫   𝐑  n     D  φ   (  y  )    (  x  )   d  μ   (  y  )     |   ≤   C   (  x  )     ∥  φ  ∥   ∞            subscript    superscript  𝐑  n      normal-D  φ  y  x  normal-d  μ  y       C  x   subscript   norm  φ        \left|\int_{\mathbf{R}^{n}}\mathrm{D}\varphi(y)(x)\,\mathrm{d}\mu(y)\right|%
 \leq C(x)\|\varphi\|_{\infty}     for every C ∞ function φ : R n → R with compact support . Then μ is absolutely continuous with respect to n -dimensional Lebesgue measure λ n on R n . In the above, D φ ( y ) denotes the Fréchet derivative of φ at y and || φ || ∞ denotes the supremum norm of φ .  References    (See section 1.3)     "  Category:Lemmas  Category:Measure theory
