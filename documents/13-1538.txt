Resolvent cubic

In mathematics, a resolvent cubic polynomial is defined as follows: Let



be a monic quartic polynomial. The resolvent cubic is the monic cubic polynomial



where









This can be used to find the roots of the quartic, by using the following relations between the roots 
 
 
 
  of f and the roots 
 
 
 
  of g:








 
  These can be established simply with Vieta's formulas.
