Hidden Markov random field

A hidden Markov random field is a generalization of a hidden Markov model. Instead of having an underlying Markov chain, hidden Markov random fields have an underlying Markov random field.
Suppose that we observe a random variable 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 . Hidden Markov random fields assume that the probabilistic nature of 
 
 
 
  is determined by the unobservable Markov random field

 
 , 
 
 
 
 . That is, given the neighbors 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is independent of all other 
 
 
 
  (Markov property). The main difference with a hidden Markov model is that neighborhood is not defined in 1 dimension but within a network, i.e. 
 
 
 
  is allowed to have more than the two neighbors that it would have in a Markov chain. The model is formulated in such a way that given 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are independent (conditional independence of the observable variables given the Markov random field).
