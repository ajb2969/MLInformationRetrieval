   Hidden Markov random field      Hidden Markov random field   A hidden Markov random field is a generalization of a hidden Markov model . Instead of having an underlying Markov chain , hidden Markov random fields have an underlying Markov random field .  Suppose that we observe a random variable    Y  i     subscript  Y  i    Y_{i}   , where    i  ∈  S      i  S    i\in S   . Hidden Markov random fields assume that the probabilistic nature of    Y  i     subscript  Y  i    Y_{i}   is determined by the unobservable Markov random field     X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   ,    i  ∈  S      i  S    i\in S   . That is, given the neighbors    N  i     subscript  N  i    N_{i}   of    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   ,    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   is independent of all other    X  j     subscript  X  j    X_{j}   (Markov property). The main difference with a hidden Markov model is that neighborhood is not defined in 1 dimension but within a network, i.e.    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   is allowed to have more than the two neighbors that it would have in a Markov chain . The model is formulated in such a way that given    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   ,    Y  i     subscript  Y  i    Y_{i}   are independent (conditional independence of the observable variables given the Markov random field).
