   Dieudonné's theorem      Dieudonné's theorem   In mathematics , Dieudonné's theorem , named after Jean Dieudonné , is a theorem on when the Minkowski sum of closed sets is closed.  Statement of theorem  Let nonempty closed convex sets     A  ,  B   ⊂  X       A  B   X    A,B\subset X   a locally convex space , if either   A   A   A   or   B   B   B   is locally compact and     recc   (  A  )    ∩   recc   (  B  )         recc  A    recc  B     \operatorname{recc}(A)\cap\operatorname{recc}(B)   (where   recc   recc   \operatorname{recc}   gives the recession cone ) is a linear subspace , then    A  -  B      A  B    A-B   is closed. 1 2  References  "  Category:Convex analysis  Category:Theorems in functional analysis     ↩  ↩
