Dieudonné's theorem

In mathematics, Dieudonné's theorem, named after Jean Dieudonné, is a theorem on when the Minkowski sum of closed sets is closed.
Statement of theorem
Let nonempty closed convex sets 
 
 
 
  a locally convex space, if either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  is locally compact and 
 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
  gives the recession cone) is a linear subspace, then 
 
 
 
  is closed.12
