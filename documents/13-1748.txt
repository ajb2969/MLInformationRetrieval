Three-twist knot

In knot theory, the three-twist knot is the twist knot with three-half twists. It is listed as the 52 knot in the Alexander-Briggs notation, and is one of two knots with crossing number five, the other being the cinquefoil knot.
The three-twist knot is a prime knot, and it is invertible but not amphichiral. Its Alexander polynomial is



its Conway polynomial is



and its Jones polynomial is


1
Because the Alexander polynomial is not monic, the three-twist knot is not fibered.
The three-twist knot is a hyperbolic knot, with its complement having a volume of approximately 2.82812.
