   Three-twist knot      Three-twist knot   In knot theory , the three-twist knot is the twist knot with three-half twists. It is listed as the 5 2 knot in the Alexander-Briggs notation , and is one of two knots with crossing number five, the other being the cinquefoil knot .  The three-twist knot is a prime knot , and it is invertible but not amphichiral . Its Alexander polynomial is        Δ   (  t  )    =     2  t   -  3   +   2   t   -  1       ,        normal-Δ  t         2  t   3     2   superscript  t    1        \Delta(t)=2t-3+2t^{-1},\,     its Conway polynomial is        ∇   (  z  )    =    2   z  2    +  1    ,       normal-∇  z       2   superscript  z  2    1     \nabla(z)=2z^{2}+1,\,     and its Jones polynomial is        V   (  q  )    =        q   -  1    -   q   -  2     +   2   q   -  3      -   q   -  4     +   q   -  5     -   q   -  6      .        V  q              superscript  q    1     superscript  q    2       2   superscript  q    3       superscript  q    4      superscript  q    5      superscript  q    6       V(q)=q^{-1}-q^{-2}+2q^{-3}-q^{-4}+q^{-5}-q^{-6}.\,    1  Because the Alexander polynomial is not monic , the three-twist knot is not fibered .  The three-twist knot is a hyperbolic knot , with its complement having a volume of approximately 2.82812.  References  "  Category:2.82812 hyperbolic volume knots and links     ↩
