The Dimensionally Extended nine-Intersection Model (DE-9IM) is a topological model and a standard used to describe the spatial relations of two regions (two geometries in two-dimensions, R2), in Geometry, Point-set topology, Geospatial topology, and fields related to computer spatial analysis. Since the spatial relations expressed by the model are topological they are invariant to rotation, translation and scaling transformations.
The matrix provides an approach for classifying geometry relations. Roughly speaking, with a true/false matrix domain, there are 512 possible 2D topologic relations, that can be grouped into binary classification schemes. For English speakers, there are about 10 schemes (relations) that have a name that reflects their semantics (e.g. "Intersects", "Touches", "Equals", and others.) When testing two geometries against a scheme, the result of this test is a spatial predicate named by the scheme.
The model was developed by Clementini and others12 based on the seminal works of Egenhofer and others34. It has been used as a basis for standards of queries and assertions in geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial databases.
Matrix model
The DE-9IM model is based on a 3×3 intersection matrix with the form:





where dim is the maximum number of dimensions of the intersection (∩) of the interior (I), boundary (B), and exterior (E) of geometries a and b.
Note that in this article the words interior and boundary are used in the sense used in algebraic topology and manifold theory, not in the sense used in general topology: e. g. by the interior of a line segment we mean the line segment without its endpoints and by its boundary, the two endpoints (in the general topology sense, the interior of a line segment in the plane is empty and the line segment is its own boundary).
In the notation of topological space operators, the matrix elements can be expressed also as

I(a)=ao    B(a)=∂a    E(a)=ae


The dimension of empty sets (∅) are denoted as −1 or  (false). The dimension of non-empty sets (¬∅) are denoted with the maximum number of dimensions of the intersection, specifically  for points,  for lines,  for areas. Then, the domain of the model is .
A simplified version of dim(x) values are obtained mapping the values  to  (true), so using the boolean domain . The matrix, denoted with operators, can be expressed as





Both matrix forms, with dimensional and boolean domains, can be serialized as "DE-9IM string codes", which represent them in a single-line string pattern. Since 1999 the string codes have a standard5 format.
For output checking or pattern analysis, a matrix value (or a string code) can be checked by a "mask": a desired output value with optional asterisk symbols as wildcards — that is, "" indicating output positions that the designer does not care about (free values or "don't-care positions"). Then, the mask's domain is , or  for the boolean form.
The simpler models 4-Intersection and 9-Intersection were proposed before DE-9IM for expressing spatial relations6 (and originated the terms 4IM and 9IM). They can be used instead of the DE-9IM to optimize computation when input conditions satisfy specific constraints.

Spatial predicates
Spatial predicates are binary invariant space relations based on the DE-9IM. For ease of use "named spatial predicates" have been defined for some common relations.
The spatial predicate functions that can be derived (expressed by masks) from DE-9IM include:8 9

Predicates that utilize the input dimensions, and are defined with masks of domain {0,1,T,F,*}




Crosses
dim(a)≠dim(b) or
 dim(any)=0













rowspan="2" a crosses b: they have some but not all interior points in common, and the dimension of the intersection is less than that of at least one of them. Mask selection rules are checked only when dim(a)≠dim(b), except by point/point or line/line inputs, otherwise is false:14

(II=0) for points or lines,   (II ∧ IE) when dim(a)dim(b)






T*T****** 
dim(a)

T*****T** 
dim(a)>dim(b)

0******** 
dim(any)=0



Overlaps
dim(a)=dim(b)









rowspan="2" a overlaps b: they have some but not all points in common, they have the same dimension, and the intersection of the interiors of the two geometries has the same dimension as the geometries themselves. Mask selection rules are checked only when dim(a)=dim(b), otherwise is false:

(II ∧ IE ∧ EI) for points or surfaces,   (II=1 ∧ IE ∧ EI) for lines




T*T***T** 
dim=0 or 2

1*T***T** 
dim=1



Notice that:

The topologically equal definition does not imply that they have the same points or even that they are of the same class.


The output of DE-9IM(a,b) have the information contained in a list of all interpretable predicates about geometries a and b.


All predicates are computed by masks. Only Crosses and Overlaps have additional conditions about dim(a) and dim(b).


All mask string codes end with '*'. This is because EE is trivially true, and thus provides no useful information.


The Equals mask, T*F**FFF*, is the "merge" of Contains (T*****FF*) and Within (T*F**F***): (II ∧ ~EI ∧ ~EB) ∧ (II ∧ ~IE ∧ ~BE).


There are no mask for situations involving complex types, like a Point/Multipoint situation. Example: with the above definition the code 0FFFFF0F2 have the Crosses predicate (satisfies the mask T*****T**), but by a more rigorous definition, like the JTS definition, not.15


The mask T*****FF* occurs in the definition of both Contains and Covers. Covers is a more inclusive relation. In particular, unlike Contains it does not distinguish between points in the boundary and in the interior of geometries. For most situations, Covers should be used in preference to Contains.16


Similarly, the mask T*F**F*** occurs in the definition of both Within and CoveredBy. For most situations, CoveredBy should be used in preference to Within.17

Interpretation
 The choice of terminology and semantics for the spatial predicates is based on reasonable conventions and the tradition of topological studies.18 Relationships such as Intersects, Disjoint, Touches, Within, Equals (between two geometries a and b) have an obvious semantic:1920

Equals:   a = b    that is    (a ∩ b = a) ∧ (a ∩ b = b)
Within:   a ∩ b = a
Intersects:   a ∩ b ≠ ∅
Touches:   (a ∩ b ≠ ∅) ∧ (aο ∩ bο = ∅)

The predicates Contains and Within have subtle aspects to their definition which are contrary to intuition. For example 21, a line L which is completely contained in the boundary of a polygon P is not considered to be contained in P. This quirk can be expressed as "Polygons do not contain their boundary". This issue is caused by the final clause of the Contains definition above: "at least one point of the interior of B lies in the interior of A". For this case, the predicate Covers has more intuitive semantics (see definition), avoiding boundary considerations.
For better understanding, the dimensionality of inputs can be used as justification for a gradual introduction of semantic complexity:






Relations between

Appropriate predicates

Semantic added





point/point

Equals, Disjoint

Other valid predicates collapses into Equals.



point/line

adds Intersects

Intersects is a refinement of Equals: "some equal point at the line".



line/line

adds Touches, Crosses, ...

Touches is a refinement of Intersects, about "boundaries" only. Crosses is about "only one point".





Coverage on possible matrix results
The number of possible results in a boolean 9IM matrix is 29=512, and in a DE-9IM matrix is 39=6561. The probability of one of these results come to satisfy a specific predicate is determined as following,

93.7% Intersects;
43.8% Touches;
25% Crosses (for valid inputs, 0% otherwise);
23.4% Covers and CoveredBy;
12.5% Contains, Overlaps (for valid inputs, 0% otherwise) and Within;
6.3% Disjoint;
3.1% Equals.

On usual applications the geometries intersects a priori, and the another relations are checked.
The composite predicates "Intersects OR Disjoint" and "Equals OR Different" have the sum 100% (always true predicates), but "Covers OR CoveredBy" have 41%, that is not the sum, because they are not logical complements neither independent relations; idem "Contains OR Within", that have 21%. The sum 25%+12.5%=37.5% is obtained when ignoring overlaping of lines in "Crosses OR Overlaps", because the valid input sets are disjoints.
Queries and assertions
The DE-9IM offers a full descriptive assertion about the two input geometries. It is a mathematical function that represents a complete set of all possible relations about two entities, like a Truth table, the Three-way comparison, a Karnaugh map or a Venn diagram. Each output value is like a truth table line, that represent relations of specific inputs.
As illustrated above, the output '212101212' resulted from DE-9IM(a,b) is a complete description of all topologic relations between specific geometries a and b. It say to us that "II=2, IB=1, IE=2, BI=1, BB=0, BE=1, EI=2, EB=1, EE=2".
By other hand, if we check predicates like Intersects(a,b) or Touches(a,b) — for the same example we have "Intersects= and Touches=" — it is an incomplete description of "all topologic relations". Predicates also do not say any thing about the dimensionality of the geometries (it doesn't matter if a and b are lines, areas or points).
This independence of geometry-type and the lack of completeness, on predicates, are useful for general queries about two geometries:







(interior/boundary/exterior semantic)


(usual semantic)



Assertions:

style="background-color:#DDC" more descriptive
  " a and b have DE-9IM(a,b)='212101212' "


style="background-color:#DDC" less descriptive
  " a Touches b "



Queries:

style="background-color:#DDC" more restrictive
 " Show all pair of geometries where DE-9IM(a,b)='212101212' "

   

style="background-color:#DDC" more general
 " Show all pair of geometries where Touches(a,b) "






For usual applications, the use of spatial predicates also is justified by being more human-readable than DE-9IM descriptions: a typical user have better intuition about predicates (than a set of interiors/border/exterior intersections).
Predicates have useful semantic into usual applications, so it is useful the translation of a DE-9IM description into a list of all associated predicates,2223 that is like a casting process between the two different semantic types. Examples:

The string codes "" and "" have the semantic of "Intersects & Crosses & Overlaps".


The string code "" have the semantic of "Equals".


The string codes "", "", "", "", and "" have the semantic of "Intersects & Touches".

Standards
The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has standardized the typical spatial predicates (Contains, Crosses, Intersects, Touches, etc.) as boolean functions, and the DE-9IM model,24 as a function that returns a string (the DE-9IM code), with domain of {0,1,2,F}, meaning 0=point, 1=line, 2=area, and F="empty set". This DE-9IM string code is a standardized format for data interchange.
The Simple feature access (ISO 19125) standard,25 in the chapter 7.2.8, "SQL routines on type Geometry", recommends as supported routines the SQL/MM Spatial26 (ISO 13249-3 Part 3: Spatial) ST_Dimension, ST_GeometryType, ST_IsEmpty, ST_IsSimple, ST_Boundary for all Geometry Types. The same standard, consistent with the definitions of relations in "Part 1, Clause 6.1.2.3" of the SQL/MM, recommends (shall be supported) the function labels: ST_Equals, ST_Disjoint, ST_Intersects, ST_Touches, ST_Crosses, ST_Within, ST_Contains, ST_Overlaps and ST_Relate.
The DE-9IM in the OGC standards use the following definitions of Interior and Boundary, for the main OGC standard geometry types:27




Subtypes

Dim

Interior (I)

boundary (B)





Point, MultiPoint

0

Point, Points

Empty



LineString, Line

1

Points that are left when the boundary points are removed.

Two end points.



LinearRing

1

All points along the geometry.

Empty.



MultilineString

1

Points that are left when the boundary points are removed.

Those points that are in the boundaries of an odd number of its elements (curves).



Polygon

2

Points within the rings.

Set of rings.



MultiPolygon

2

Points within the rings.

Set of rings of its elements (polygons).



NOTICE: exterior points (E) are points p not in the interior or boundary, so not need extra interpretation, .



Implementation and practical use
Most spatial databases, such as PostGIS, implements the DE-9IM() model by the standard functions:28 ST_Relate, ST_Equals, ST_Intersects, etc. The function ST_Relate(a,b) outputs the standard OGC's DE-9IM string code.
Examples: two geometries, a and b, that intersects and touches with a point (for instance with dim()= and dim()=), can be st_relate(a,b)='FF1F0F1F2' or st_relate(a,b)='FF10F0102' or st_relate(a,b)='FF1F0F1F2'. It also satisfies st_intersects(a,b)=true and st_touches(a,b)=true. When ST_Relate(a,b)='0FFFFF212', the returned DE-9IM code have the semantic of "Intersects(a,b) & Crosses(a,b) & Within(a,b) & CoveredBy(a,b)", that is, returns true on the boolean expression st_intersects(a,b) AND st_crosses(a,b) AND  st_within(a,b) AND  st_coveredby(a,b).
The use of  is faster than direct computing of a set of correspondent predicates.29 There are cases where the use of  is the unique access form of a complex predicate — see the example of the code 0FFFFF0F2,30 of a point that not "crosses" a multipoint (a object that is a set of points), but predicate Crosses (when defined by a mask) returns true.
It is usual also to overload the  by a mask parameter, or use a returned  string into the  function.31 When using , it returns a boolean. Examples:

ST_Relate(a,b,'*FF*FF212') returns true when ST_Relate(a,b) is 0FFFFF212 or 01FFFF212, and returns false when 01FFFF122 or 0FF1FFFFF.
ST_relateMatch('0FFFFF212','*FF*FF212') and ST_relateMatch('01FFFF212','TTF*FF212') are true, ST_relateMatch('01FFFF122','*FF*FF212') is false.

Synonyms

"Egenhofer-Matrix" is a synonym for the 9IM 3x3 matrix of boolean domain.32
"Clementini-Matrix" is a synonym for the DE-9IM 3x3 matrix of {0,1,2,F} domain.33
"Egenhofer operators" and "Clementini operators" are sometimes a reference to matrix elements as II, IE, etc. that can be used in boolean operations. Example: the predicate "G1 contains G2" can be expressed by "1| II ∧ ~EI ∧ ~EB |G1''>", that can be translated to mask syntax, "T*****FF*".
Predicates "meets" is a synonym for touches; "inside" is a synonym for within
Oracle's34 "ANYINTERACT" is a synonym for intersects and "OVERLAPBDYINTERSECT" is a synonym for overlaps. Its "OVERLAPBDYDISJOINT" does not have a corresponding named predicate.
