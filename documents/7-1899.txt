Transitively normal subgroup

In mathematics, in the field of group theory, a subgroup of a group is said to be transitively normal in the group if every normal subgroup of the subgroup is also normal in the whole group. In symbols, 
 
 
 
 
  is a transitively normal subgroup of 
 
 
 
  if for every 
 
 
 
  normal in 
 
 
 
 , we have that 
 
 
 
  is normal in 
 
 
 
 
 .
An alternate way to characterize these subgroups is: every normal subgroup preserving automorphism of the whole group must restrict to a normal subgroup preserving automorphism of the subgroup.
Here are some facts about transitively normal subgroups:

Every normal subgroup of a transitively normal subgroup is normal.
Every direct factor, or more generally, every central factor is transitively normal. Thus, every

central subgroup is transitively normal.

A transitively normal subgroup of a transitively normal subgroup is transitively normal.
A transitively normal subgroup is normal.
