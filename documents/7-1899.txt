   Transitively normal subgroup      Transitively normal subgroup   In mathematics , in the field of group theory , a subgroup of a group is said to be transitively normal in the group if every normal subgroup of the subgroup is also normal in the whole group. In symbols,   H   H   H   is a transitively normal subgroup of   G   G   G   if for every   K   K   K   normal in   H   H   H   , we have that   K   K   K   is normal in   G   G   G   .  An alternate way to characterize these subgroups is: every normal subgroup preserving automorphism of the whole group must restrict to a normal subgroup preserving automorphism of the subgroup.  Here are some facts about transitively normal subgroups:   Every normal subgroup of a transitively normal subgroup is normal.  Every direct factor , or more generally, every central factor is transitively normal. Thus, every   central subgroup is transitively normal.   A transitively normal subgroup of a transitively normal subgroup is transitively normal.  A transitively normal subgroup is normal.   See also   Normal subgroup   "  Category:Subgroup properties
