   Vacuum Rabi oscillation      Vacuum Rabi oscillation   A vacuum Rabi oscillation is a damped oscillation of an initially excited atom coupled to an electromagnetic  resonator or cavity in which the atom alternately emits photon (s) into a single-mode electromagnetic cavity and reabsorbs them. The atom interacts with a single-mode field confined to a limited volume V in an optical cavity. 1  2 3  Spontaneous emission results as a consequence of coupling between the atom and the vacuum fluctuations of the cavity field. The vacuum Rabi frequency is given by         ω  =    2  ℏ   ℰ  f   (  𝐑  )    ⟨   𝐩  ⋅  ϵ   ⟩     .      ω      2  Planck-constant-over-2-pi   ℰ  f  𝐑   delimited-⟨⟩   normal-⋅  𝐩  ϵ       \omega=\frac{2}{\hbar}\mathcal{E}f(\mathbf{R})\langle\mathbf{p\cdot\epsilon}%
 \rangle\ .        where R is the location of the atom, f ( R ) = exp ( i k . R ) for plane-wave fields, ε is the field polarization,   ℰ   ℰ   \mathcal{E}   = [ ħ ω k / ( 2 ε 0 V )] 1/2 is the electric field per photon, and  is the dipole matrix element.
