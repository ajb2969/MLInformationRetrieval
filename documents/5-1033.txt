   Polydisc      Polydisc   In the theory of functions of several complex variables , a branch of mathematics , a polydisc is a Cartesian product of discs .  More specifically, if we denote by    D   (  z  ,  r  )       D   z  r     D(z,r)   the open disc of center z and radius r in the complex plane , then an open polydisc is a set of the form         D   (   z  1   ,   r  1   )    √ó  ‚Ä¶  √ó  D    (   z  n   ,   r  n   )    .          D    subscript  z  1    subscript  r  1     normal-‚Ä¶  D     subscript  z  n    subscript  r  n      D(z_{1},r_{1})\times\dots\times D(z_{n},r_{n}).     It can be equivalently written as       {   w  =   (   w  1   ,   w  2   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   w  n   )   ‚àà   ùêÇ  n    ‚à£     |    z  k   -   w  k    |   <   r  k    ,    for all  k   =   1  ,  ‚Ä¶  ,  n     }   .     conditional-set      w    subscript  w  1    subscript  w  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  w  n          superscript  ùêÇ  n      formulae-sequence         subscript  z  k    subscript  w  k      subscript  r  k        for all  k    1  normal-‚Ä¶  n       \{w=(w_{1},w_{2},\dots,w_{n})\in{\mathbf{C}}^{n}\mid|z_{k}-w_{k}|     One should not confuse the polydisc with the open ball in C n , which is defined as       {   w  ‚àà   ùêÇ  n    ‚à£    ‚à•   z  -  w   ‚à•   <  r   }   .     conditional-set    w   superscript  ùêÇ  n       norm    z  w    r     \{w\in\mathbf{C}^{n}\mid\lVert z-w\rVert     Here, the norm is the Euclidean distance in C n .  When    n  >  1      n  1    n>1   , open balls and open polydiscs are not biholomorphically equivalent, that is, there is no biholomorphic mapping between the two. This was proven by Poincar√© in 1907 by showing that their automorphism groups have different dimensions as Lie groups .  When    n  =  2      n  2    n=2   the term bidisc is sometimes used.  A polydisc is an example of logarithmically convex  Reinhardt domain .  References      "  Category:Several complex variables
