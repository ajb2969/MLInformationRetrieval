   TRNA (adenine9-N1)-methyltransferase      TRNA (adenine9-N1)-methyltransferase   TRNA (adenine 9 -N 1 )-methyltransferase (, Trm10p , tRNA(m1G9/m1A9)-methyltransferase , tRNA(m1G9/m1A9)MTase , TK0422p (gene) , tRNA m1A9-methyltransferase , tRNA m1A9 Mtase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (adenine 9 -N 1 )-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine 9 in tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 1 -methyladenine 9 in tRNA   The enzyme from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius specifically methylates adenine 9 in tRNA.
