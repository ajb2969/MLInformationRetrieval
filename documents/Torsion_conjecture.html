<h1>Torsion conjecture</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a href="algebraic_geometry" title="wikilink">algebraic geometry</a> and <a href="number_theory" title="wikilink">number theory</a>, the <strong>torsion conjecture</strong> or <strong>uniform boundedness conjecture</strong> for <a href="abelian_varieties" title="wikilink">abelian varieties</a> states that the <a href="order_(group_theory)" title="wikilink">order</a> of the <a href="torsion_group" title="wikilink">torsion group</a> of an abelian variety over a <a href="number_field" title="wikilink">number field</a> can be bounded in terms of the dimension of the variety and the number field. A stronger version of the conjecture is that the torsion is bounded in terms of the dimension of the variety and the degree of the number field.</p>

<p>The (strong) torsion conjecture has been completely resolved in the case of <a href="elliptic_curves" title="wikilink">elliptic curves</a>.  proved uniform boundedness for elliptic curves over the rationals. His techniques were generalized by  and , who obtained uniform boundedness for <a href="quadratic_field" title="wikilink">quadratic fields</a> and number fields of degree at most 8 respectively. Finally,  proved the conjecture for elliptic curves over any number field. The proof centers around a careful study of the rational points on <a href="classical_modular_curve" title="wikilink">classical modular curves</a>. An effective bound for the size of the torsion group in terms of the degree of the number field was given by .</p>

<p>Mazur provided a complete list of possible torsion subgroups for rational elliptic curves. If <em>C</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> denotes the <a href="cyclic_group" title="wikilink">cyclic group</a> of order <em>n</em>, then the possible torsion subgroups are <em>C</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> with 1 ≤ <em>n</em> ≤ 10, and also <em>C</em><sub>12</sub>; and the <a href="Direct_sum_of_groups" title="wikilink">direct sum</a> of <em>C</em><sub>2</sub> with <em>C</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>C</em><sub>4</sub>, <em>C</em><sub>6</sub> or <em>C</em><sub>8</sub>. In the opposite direction, all these torsion structures occur infinitely often over <strong>Q</strong>, since the corresponding modular curves are all genus zero curves with a rational point. A complete list of possible torsion groups is also available for elliptic curves over quadratic number fields, and there are substantial partial results for cubic and quartic number fields .</p>
