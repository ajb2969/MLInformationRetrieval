   Chargino      Chargino   In particle physics , the chargino is a hypothetical particle which refers to the mass eigenstates of a charged superpartner , i.e. any new electrically charged fermion (with spin 1/2) predicted by supersymmetry . They are linear combinations of the charged wino and charged higgsinos . There are two charginos that are fermions and are electrically charged, which are typically labeled  (the lightest) and  (the heaviest) although sometimes     χ  ~   1  ±     superscript   subscript   normal-~  χ   1   plus-or-minus    \tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}   and     χ  ~   2  ±     superscript   subscript   normal-~  χ   2   plus-or-minus    \tilde{\chi}_{2}^{\pm}   is also used to refer to charginos, when     χ  ~   i  0     superscript   subscript   normal-~  χ   i   0    \tilde{\chi}_{i}^{0}   is used to refer to neutralinos . The heavier chargino can decay through the neutral Z boson to the lighter chargino. Both can decay through a charged W boson to a neutralino:    →  +    →  +    →  +    External links   http://lepsusy.web.cern.ch/lepsusy/www/inoslowdmsummer02/charginolowdm_pub.html  http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5073   "  Category:Supersymmetry  Category:Hypothetical elementary particles
