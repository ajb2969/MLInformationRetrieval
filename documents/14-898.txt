  |- !Orthogonal projections in B5 Coxeter plane |} In five-dimensional geometry, a runcinated 5-orthoplex is a convex uniform 5-polytope with 3rd order truncation (runcination) of the regular 5-orthoplex.
There are 8 runcinations of the 5-orthoplex with permutations of truncations, and cantellations. Four are more simply constructed relative to the 5-cube.

Snub 5-demicube
The snub 5-demicube defined as an alternation of the omnitruncated 5-demicube is not uniform, but it can be given Coxeter diagram  or  and symmetry [32,1,1]+ or [4,(3,3,3)+], and constructed from 32 snub 5-cells, 80 alternated 6-6 duoprisms, 40 icosahedral prisms, 10 snub 24-cells, and 960 irregular tetrahedrons filling the gaps at the deleted vertices.
