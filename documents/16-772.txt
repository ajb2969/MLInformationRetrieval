   Canopy conductance      Canopy conductance   Canopy conductance , commonly denoted    g  c     subscript  g  c    g_{c}   , is a dimensionless quantity characterizing radiation distribution in tree canopy . By definition, it is calculated as a ratio of daily water use to daily mean vapor pressure deficit (VPD). 1 Canopy conductance can be also experimentally obtained by measuring sap flow and environmental variables. 2  Stomatal conductance may be used as a reference value to validate the data, by summing the total stomatal conductance    g  s     subscript  g  s    g_{s}   of all leaf classes within the canopy. 3      g  c   =     ∑   l  a  y  e   r  1     l  a  y  e   r  N      (    g   s  ,   s  u  n    i   ⋅   l   s  u  n   i    )    +   (    g   s  ,   s  h  a  d  e     ⋅   l   s  h  a  d  e     )         subscript  g  c       superscript   subscript     l  a  y  e   subscript  r  1       l  a  y  e   subscript  r  N      normal-⋅   subscript   superscript  g  i    s    s  u  n      superscript   subscript  l    s  u  n    i      normal-⋅   subscript  g   s    s  h  a  d  e      subscript  l    s  h  a  d  e        g_{c}=\sum_{layer_{1}}^{layer_{N}}(g^{i}_{s,sun}\cdot l_{sun}^{i})+(g_{s,shade%
