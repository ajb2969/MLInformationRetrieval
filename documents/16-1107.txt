Stable range condition




Stable range condition

in algebra, the stable range of a ring R is the smallest integer n such that if elements $v_0, \dots, v_n$ in R generate the unit ideal (they form a unimodular row), then for some $t_1, \dots, t_n$ in R the elements $v_i - v_0 t_i, \, 1 \le i \le n$ also generate the unit ideal.1
If R is a commutative Noetherian ring of Krull dimension d, then the stable range of R is at most $d+1$ (a theorem of Bass).
