Image derivatives
Image derivatives can be computed by using small convolution filters of size 2 x 2 or 3 x 3, such as the  [[Discrete Laplace operator|Laplacian]], [[Sobel operator|Sobel]], [[Roberts cross|Roberts]] and [[Prewitt operator|Prewitt]]  operators.Pratt, W.K., 2007. Digital image processing (4th ed.). John Wiley & Sons, Inc. pp. 465–522 However, a larger mask will generally give a better approximation of the derivative and examples of such filters are Gaussian derivatives H. Bouma, A.

The pixel value is computed as a convolution


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the derivative kernel and 
 
 
 
  is the pixel values in a region of the image and 
 
 
 
 
  is the operator that performs the convolution.
Sobel Derivatives
The derivative kernels, known as the Sobel operator are defined as follows, for the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  directions respectively:



where 
 
 
 
  here denotes the 2-dimensional convolution operation.
This operator is separable and can be decomposed as the products of an interpolation and a differentiation kernel, so that, 
 
 
 
 , for an example can be written as



Farid and Simoncelli Derivatives
Farid and Simoncelli.56 propose to use a pair of kernels, one for interpolation and another for differentiation (compare to Sobel above). These kernels, of fixed sizes 5 x 5 and 7 x 7, are optimized so that the Fourier transform approximates their correct derivative relationship.
In Matlab code the so called 5-tap filter is
  k  = [0.030320  0.249724  0.439911  0.249724  0.030320];
   d  = [0.104550  0.292315  0.000000 -0.292315 -0.104550];
   d2 = [0.232905  0.002668 -0.471147  0.002668  0.232905];
And the 7-tap filter is
  k  = [ 0.004711  0.069321  0.245410  0.361117  0.245410  0.069321  0.004711];
   d  = [ 0.018708  0.125376  0.193091  0.000000 -0.193091 -0.125376 -0.018708];
   d2 = [ 0.055336  0.137778 -0.056554 -0.273118 -0.056554  0.137778  0.055336];
As an example the first order derivatives can be computed in the following using Matlab in order to perform the convolution
 
 Iu=-conv2(conv(d,k),conv(k,k),im,'same');
 Iv=-conv2(conv(k,k),conv(d,k),im,'same');
Hast Derivatives
Derivative filters based on arbitrary cubic splines was presented by Hast.7 He showed how both first and second order derivatives can be computed more correctly using cubic or trigonometric splines. Efficient derivative filters need to be of odd length so that the derivative is computed for the central pixel. However, any cubic filter is fitted over 4 sample points, giving a centre that falls between pixels. This is solved by a double filtering approach giving filters of size 7 x 7. The idea is to first filter by interpolation so that the interpolated value between pixels are obtained, whereafter the procedure is repeated using a derivative filters, where the centre value now falls on pixel centres. This can easily be proved by the associative law for convolution


 
  Therefore the convolution kernel for computing the derivative 
 
 
 
  using an interpolating kernel 
 
 
 
  and a derivative kernel 
 
 
 
 
  becomes



Also keep in mind that convolution is commutative, so that the order of the two kernels does not matter and it is also possible to insert a second order derivative as well as a first order derivative kernel. These kernels are derived from the fact that any spline surface can be fitted over a square pixel region, compare to Bezier surfaces. Hast proves that such a surface can be performed as a separable convolution



where 
 
 
 
  is the spline basis matrix, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are vectors containing the variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , such as





 
  The convolution kernels can now be set to









The first order derivatives at the central pixel are hence computed as


 
  and



Likewise, with the second order derivative kernels are


 
  and



The cubic spline filter is evaluated in its centre 
 
 
 
  and therefore


 
  Likewise the first order derivatives becomes


 
  And in a similar manner the second order derivatives are



It should be noted that any cubic filter can be applied and used for computing the image derivates using the above equations, such as Bézier, Hermite or B-splines.
The example in below in Matlab use the Catmull-Rom spline to compute the derivatives
 
 M=[-1,3,-3,1;2,-5,4,-1;-1,0,1,0;0,2,0,0]*0.5;
 u = [0.125;0.25;0.5;1];
 up = [0.75;1;1;0];
 d=up'*M;
 k=u'*M;
 Iu=-conv2(conv(d,k),conv(k,k),im,'same');
 Iv=-conv2(conv(k,k),conv(d,k),im,'same');
Other Approaches
Steerable filters can be used for computing derivatives 8 Moreover, Savitzky and Golay 9 propose a least-squares polynomial smoothing approach, which could be used for computing derivatives and Luo et al 10 discuss this approach in further detail. Scharr 111213 shows how to create derivative filters by minimizing the error in the Fourier domain and Jähne et al 14 discuss in more detail the principles of filter design, including derivative filters.
