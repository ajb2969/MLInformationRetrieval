   Dynkin index      Dynkin index   In mathematics , the Dynkin index      x  λ     subscript  x  λ    x_{\lambda}     of a representation with highest weight    |  λ  |      λ    |\lambda|   of a compact simple Lie algebra  g that has a highest weight    λ   λ   \lambda   is defined by       tr   (    t  a    t  b    )    =   2   x  λ    g   a  b           tr     subscript  t  a    subscript  t  b       2   subscript  x  λ    subscript  g    a  b       {\rm tr}(t_{a}t_{b})=2x_{\lambda}g_{ab}     evaluated in the representation    |  λ  |      λ    |\lambda|   . Here    t  a     subscript  t  a    t_{a}   are the matrices representing the generators, and    g   a  b      subscript  g    a  b     g_{ab}   is       tr   (    t  a    t  b    )    =   2   g   a  b           tr     subscript  t  a    subscript  t  b       2   subscript  g    a  b       {\rm tr}(t_{a}t_{b})=2g_{ab}     evaluated in the defining representation.  By taking traces, we find that       x  λ   =     dim   (   |  λ  |   )     2   dim   (  g  )       (  λ  ,   λ  +   2  ρ    )         subscript  x  λ        dimension    λ      2   dimension  g      λ    λ    2  ρ        x_{\lambda}=\frac{\dim(|\lambda|)}{2\dim(g)}(\lambda,\lambda+2\rho)     where the Weyl vector      ρ  =    1  2     ∑   α  ∈   Δ  +     α        ρ      1  2     subscript     α   superscript  normal-Δ      α      \rho=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\alpha\in\Delta^{+}}\alpha     is equal to half of the sum of all the positive roots of g . The expression    (  λ  ,   λ  +   2  ρ    )     λ    λ    2  ρ      (\lambda,\lambda+2\rho)   is the value quadratic Casimir in the representation    |  λ  |      λ    |\lambda|   . The index    x  λ     subscript  x  λ    x_{\lambda}   is always a positive integer.  In the particular case where   λ   λ   \lambda   is the highest root , meaning that    |  λ  |      λ    |\lambda|   is the adjoint representation ,    x  λ     subscript  x  λ    x_{\lambda}   is equal to the dual Coxeter number .
