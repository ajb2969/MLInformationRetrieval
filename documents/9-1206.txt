Dynkin index

In mathematics, the Dynkin index



of a representation with highest weight 
 
 
 
  of a compact simple Lie algebra g that has a highest weight

 
  is defined by



evaluated in the representation 
 
 
 
 . Here 
 
 
 
  are the matrices representing the generators, and 
 
 
 
  is



evaluated in the defining representation.
By taking traces, we find that



where the Weyl vector



is equal to half of the sum of all the positive roots of g. The expression 
 
 
 
  is the value quadratic Casimir in the representation 
 
 
 
 . The index 
 
 
 
  is always a positive integer.
In the particular case where 
 
 
 
  is the highest root, meaning that 
 
 
 
  is the adjoint representation, 
 
 
 
  is equal to the dual Coxeter number.
