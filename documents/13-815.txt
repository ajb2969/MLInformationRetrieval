Hudde's rules

In mathematics, Hudde's rules are two properties of polynomial roots described by Johann Hudde.
1. If r is a double root of the polynomial equation







and if 
 
 
 
  are numbers in arithmetic progression, then r is also a root of
 
 



This definition is a form of the modern theorem that if r is a double root of ƒ(x) = 0, then r is a root of ƒ '(x) = 0.
 

2. If for x = a the polynomial







takes on a relative maximum or minimum value, then a is a root of the equation
 
 



This definition is a modification of Fermat's theorem in the form that if ƒ(a) is a relative maximum or minimum value of a polynomial ƒ(x), then ƒ '(a) = 0.
