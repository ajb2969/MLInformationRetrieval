Delannoy number

In mathematics, a Delannoy number

 
  describes the number of paths from the southwest corner (0, 0) of a rectangular grid to the northeast corner (m, n), using only single steps north, northeast, or east. The Delannoy numbers are named after French army officer and amateur mathematician Henri Delannoy.1
The Delannoy number 
 
 
 
  also counts the number of global alignments of two sequences of lengths 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 ,2 the number of points in an m-dimensional integer lattice that are at most n steps from the origin,3 and, in cellular automata, the number of cells in an m-dimensional von Neumann neighborhood of radius n.4
Example
The Delannoy number D(3,3) equals 63. The following figure illustrates the 63 Delannoy paths through a 3 × 3 grid:

The subset of paths that do not rise above the SW–NE diagonal are counted by a related family of numbers, the Schröder numbers.

In this array, the numbers in the first row are all one, the numbers in the second row are the odd numbers, the numbers in the third row are the centered square numbers, and the numbers in the fourth row are the centered octahedral numbers. Alternatively, the same numbers can be arranged in a Triangular array resembling Pascal's triangle, also called the tribonacci triangle,6 in which each number is the sum of the three numbers above it:
            1
          1   1
        1   3   1
      1   5   5   1
    1   7  13   7   1
  1   9  25  25   9   1
1  11  41  63  41  11   1
Central Delannoy numbers
The central Delannoy numbers D(n) = D(n,n) are the numbers for a square n × n grid. The first few central Delannoy numbers (starting with n=0) are:

1, 3, 13, 63, 321, 1683, 8989, 48639, 265729, ... .
 

Computation
Delannoy numbers
For 
 
 
 
  diagonal (i.e. northeast) steps, there must be 
 
 
 
  steps in the 
 
 
 
  direction and 
 
 
 
  steps in the 
 
 
 
 
  direction in order to reach the point 
 
 
 
 ; as these steps can be performed in any order, the number of such paths is given by the multinomial coefficient

 
 . Hence, one gets the closed-form expression



An alternative expression is given by



The basic recurrence relation for the Delannoy numbers is easily seen to be



This recurrence relation also leads directly to the generating function



Central Delannoy numbers
Substituting 
 
 
 
  in the first closed form expression above, replacing 
 
 
 
 , and a little algebra, gives



while the second expression above yields



The central Delannoy numbers satisfy also a three-term recurrence relationship among themselves,7



and have a generating function



The leading asymptotic behavior of the central Delannoy numbers is given by



where
