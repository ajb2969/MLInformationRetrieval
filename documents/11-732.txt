   Imidazolonepropionase      Imidazolonepropionase   In enzymology , an imidazolonepropionase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-3-(5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-3H-imidazol-4-yl)propanoate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-formimidoyl-L-glutamate + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-3-(5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-3H-imidazol-4-yl)propanoate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are N-formimidoyl-L-glutamate and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-(5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-3H-imidazol-4-yl)propanoate amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include 4(5)-imidazolone-5(4)-propionic acid hydrolase , and imidazolone propionic acid hydrolase . This enzyme participates in histidine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
