   L-methionine (S)-S-oxide reductase      L-methionine (S)-S-oxide reductase   In enzymology , a L-methionine (S)-S-oxide reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-methionine + thioredoxin disulfide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-methionine (S)-S-oxide + thioredoxin   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-methionine , thioredoxin disulfide , and H 2 O , whereas its two products are L-methionine (S)-S-oxide and thioredoxin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with a disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-methionine:thioredoxin-disulfide S-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include fSMsr , methyl sulfoxide reductase I and II , acetylmethionine sulfoxide reductase , methionine sulfoxide reductase , L-methionine:oxidized-thioredoxin S-oxidoreductase , methionine-S-oxide reductase , and free-methionine (S)-S-oxide reductase . This enzyme participates in methionine metabolism .  References        "  Category:EC 1.8.4  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
