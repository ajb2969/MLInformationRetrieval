Hydroxyglutamate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a hydroxyglutamate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-hydroxy-L-glutamate 
 
 
 
  4-amino-3-hydroxybutanoate + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 3-hydroxy-L-glutamate, and two products, 4-amino-3-hydroxybutanoate and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-hydroxy-L-glutamate 1-carboxy-lyase (4-amino-3-hydroxybutanoate-forming). This enzyme is also called 3-hydroxy-L-glutamate 1-carboxy-lyase. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
