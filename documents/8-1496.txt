Stolarsky mean

In mathematics, the Stolarsky mean of two positive real numbers x, y is defined as:



It is derived from the mean value theorem, which states that a secant line, cutting the graph of a differentiable function 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , has the same slope as a line tangent to the graph at some point 
 
 
 
  in the interval

 
 .



The Stolarsky mean is obtained by


 
  when choosing

Special cases



 
  is the minimum.


 
  is the geometric mean.


 
  is the logarithmic mean. It can be obtained from the mean value theorem by choosing 
 
 
 
 .


 
  is the power mean with exponent 
 
 
 
 .


 
  is the identric mean. It can be obtained from the mean value theorem by choosing 
 
 
 
 .


 
  is the arithmetic mean.


 
  is a connection to the quadratic mean and the geometric mean.


 
  is the maximum.

Generalizations
One can generalize the mean to n + 1 variables by considering the mean value theorem for divided differences for the nth derivative. One obtains
