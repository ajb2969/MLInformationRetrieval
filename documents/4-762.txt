   Lorentz–Lorenz equation      Lorentz–Lorenz equation   The Lorentz–Lorenz equation , also known as the Clausius–Mossotti relation and Maxwell's formula, relates the refractive index of a substance to its polarizability .  The most general form of the Lorentz–Lorenz equation is          n  2   -  1     n  2   +  2    =     4  π   3   N  α    ,           superscript  n  2   1      superscript  n  2   2          4  π   3   N  α     \frac{n^{2}-1}{n^{2}+2}=\frac{4\pi}{3}N\alpha,   where   n   n   n   is the refractive index ,   N   N   N   is the number of molecules per unit volume, and   α   α   \alpha   is the mean polarizability . This equation is only valid for certain crystal structures. 1 2  A more specialized form of the Lorentz–Lorenz equation gives the refractive index    n   n   n   of a dilute gas as      n  ≈    1  +    3  A  p    R  T          n      1      3  A  p     R  T        n\approx\sqrt{1+\frac{3Ap}{RT}}   where   A   A   A   is the molar refractivity ,   p   p   p   is the pressure of the gas,   R   R   R   is the universal gas constant , and   T   T   T   is the (absolute) temperature.  History  The Lorentz–Lorenz equation is named after the Danish mathematician and scientist Ludvig Lorenz , who published it in 1869, and the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz , who discovered it independently in 1878.
