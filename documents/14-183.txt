   Grubel–Lloyd index      Grubel–Lloyd index   The Grubel–Lloyd index measures intra-industry trade of a particular product. It was introduced by Herb Grubel and Peter Lloyd in 1971.      G   L  i   =      (    X  i   +   M  i    )   -   |    X  i   -   M  i    |      X  i   +   M  i      =  1  -     |    X  i   -   M  i    |     X  i   +   M  i      ;  0  ≤  G   L  i   ≤  1     fragments  G   subscript  L  i           subscript  X  i    subscript  M  i         subscript  X  i    subscript  M  i         subscript  X  i    subscript  M  i      1          subscript  X  i    subscript  M  i        subscript  X  i    subscript  M  i     italic-  normal-;  0   G   subscript  L  i    1    GL_{i}=\dfrac{(X_{i}+M_{i})-\left|X_{i}-M_{i}\right|}{X_{i}+M_{i}}=1-\dfrac{%
 \left|X_{i}-M_{i}\right|}{X_{i}+M_{i}}\qquad;\ 0\leq GL_{i}\leq 1     where X i denotes the export , M i the import of good i .  If GL i = 1, there is only intra-industry trade, no inter-industry trade . This means for example the Country in consideration Exports the same quantity of good i as much at it Imports. Conversely, if GL i = 0, there is no intra-industry trade, only inter-industry trade. This would mean that the Country in consideration only either Exports or only Imports good i .
