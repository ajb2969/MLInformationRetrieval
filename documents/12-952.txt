Brun sieve

In the field of number theory, the Brun sieve (also called Brun's pure sieve) is a technique for estimating the size of "sifted sets" of positive integers which satisfy a set of conditions which are expressed by congruences. It was developed by Viggo Brun in 1915.
Description
In terms of sieve theory the Brun sieve is of combinatorial type: that is, derives from a careful use of the inclusion-exclusion principle.
Let A be a set of positive integers ≤ x and let P be a set of primes. For each p in P, let Ap denote the set of elements of A divisible by p and extend this to let Ad the intersection of the Ap for p dividing d, when d is a product of distinct primes from P. Further let A1 denote A itself. Let z be a positive real number and P(z) denote the primes in P ≤ z. The object of the sieve is to estimate



We assume that |Ad| may be estimated by



where w is a multiplicative function and X   =   |A|. Let



Brun's pure sieve
This formulation is from [http://books.google.ro/books?id=1swo9Yf3d2YC&printsec;;=frontcover#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Cojocaru & Murty], Theorem 6.1.2. With the notation as above, assume that

|Rd| ≤ w(d) for any squarefree d composed of primes in P ;
w(p) < C for all p in P ;




where C, D, E are constants.
Then



where b is any positive integer. In particular, if log z  S(A,P,z) = X \cdot W(z) (1+o(1)) . \, 
Applications

Brun's theorem: the sum of the reciprocals of the twin primes converges;
Schnirelmann's theorem: every even number is a sum of at most C primes (where C can be taken to be 6);
There are infinitely many pairs of integers differing by 2, where each of the member of the pair is the product of at most 9 primes;
Every even number is the sum of two numbers each of which is the product of at most 9 primes.

The last two results were superseded by Chen's theorem.
