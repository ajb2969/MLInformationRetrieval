   Brun sieve      Brun sieve   In the field of number theory , the Brun sieve (also called Brun's pure sieve ) is a technique for estimating the size of "sifted sets" of positive integers which satisfy a set of conditions which are expressed by congruences . It was developed by Viggo Brun in 1915.  Description  In terms of sieve theory the Brun sieve is of combinatorial type : that is, derives from a careful use of the inclusion-exclusion principle .  Let A be a set of positive integers ≤ x and let P be a set of primes. For each p in P , let A p denote the set of elements of A divisible by p and extend this to let A d the intersection of the A p for p dividing d , when d is a product of distinct primes from P . Further let A 1 denote A itself. Let z be a positive real number and P ( z ) denote the primes in P ≤ z . The object of the sieve is to estimate        S   (  A  ,  P  ,  z  )    =   |   A  ∖    ⋃   p  ∈   P   (  z  )       A  p     |    .        S   A  P  z        A    subscript     p    P  z      subscript  A  p        S(A,P,z)=\left|A\setminus\bigcup_{p\in P(z)}A_{p}\right|.     We assume that | A d | may be estimated by       |   A  d   |   =      w   (  d  )    d   X   +   R  d           subscript  A  d            w  d   d   X    subscript  R  d      \left|A_{d}\right|=\frac{w(d)}{d}X+R_{d}     where w is a multiplicative function and X =   | A |. Let        W   (  z  )    =    ∏   p  ∈   P   (  z  )       (   1  -    w   (  p  )    p    )     .        W  z     subscript  product    p    P  z       1      w  p   p       W(z)=\prod_{p\in P(z)}\left(1-\frac{w(p)}{p}\right).     Brun's pure sieve  This formulation is from [ http://books.google.ro/books?id=1swo9Yf3d2YC&printsec; ;=frontcover#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Cojocaru & Murty], Theorem 6.1.2. With the notation as above, assume that   | R d | ≤ w ( d ) for any squarefree d composed of primes in P ;  w ( p ) < C for all p in P ;         ∑   p  ∈   P  z       w   (  p  )    p    <    D   log   log  z     +  E    ;        subscript     p   subscript  P  z         w  p   p        D      z     E     \sum_{p\in P_{z}}\frac{w(p)}{p}      where C , D , E are constants.  Then       S   (  A  ,  P  ,  z  )    =      X  ⋅  W    (  z  )    ⋅   (   1  +   O   (    (   log  z   )    -   b   log  b      )     )    +   O   (   z   b   log   log  z      )           S   A  P  z       normal-⋅     normal-⋅  X  W   z     1    O   superscript    z       b    b           O   superscript  z    b      z          S(A,P,z)=X\cdot W(z)\cdot\left({1+O\left((\log z)^{-b\log b}\right)}\right)+O%
 \left(z^{b\log\log z}\right)     where b is any positive integer. In particular, if log z S(A,P,z) = X \cdot W(z) (1+o(1)) . \,  Applications   Brun's theorem : the sum of the reciprocals of the twin primes converges;  Schnirelmann's theorem : every even number is a sum of at most C primes (where C can be taken to be 6);  There are infinitely many pairs of integers differing by 2, where each of the member of the pair is the product of at most 9 primes;  Every even number is the sum of two numbers each of which is the product of at most 9 primes.   The last two results were superseded by Chen's theorem .  References         .   "  Category:Sieve theory
