Second covariant derivative

In the math branches of differential geometry and vector calculus, the second covariant derivative, or the second order covariant derivative, of a vector field is the derivative of its derivative with respect to another two tangent vector fields. Formally, given a (pseudo)-Riemannian manifold (M, g) associated with a vector bundle E → M, let ∇ denote the Levi-Civita connection given by the metric g, and denote by Γ(E) the space of the smooth sections of the total space E. Denote by T*M the cotangent bundle of M. Then the second covariant derivative can be defined as the composition of the two ∇s as follows: 1


 
  For example, given vector fields u, v, w, a second covariant derivative can be written as


 
  by using abstract index notation. It is also straightforward to verify that


 
  Thus


 
  One may use this fact to write Riemann curvature tensor as follows: 2


 
  Similarly, one may also obtain the second covariant derivative of a function f as


 
  Since Levi-Civita connection is torsion-free, for any vector fields u and v, we have


 
  By feeding the function f on both sides of the above equation, we have





 
  Thus


 
  That is, the value of the second covariant derivative of a function is independent on the order of taking derivatives.
