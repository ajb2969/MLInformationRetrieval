Weil‚ÄìBrezin Map

In mathematics, the Weil‚ÄìBrezin map, named after Andr√© Weil1 and Jonathan Brezin,2 is a unitary transformation that maps a Schwartz function on the real line to a smooth function on the Heisenberg manifold. The Weil‚ÄìBrezin map gives a geometric interpretation of the Fourier transform, the Plancherel theorem and the Poisson summation formula.345 The image of Gaussian functions under the Weil‚ÄìBrezin map are nil-theta functions, which are related to theta functions. The Weil‚ÄìBrezin map is sometimes referred to as the Zak transform,6 which is widely applied in the field of physics and signal processing; however, the Weil‚ÄìBrezin Map is defined via Heisenberg group geometrically, whereas there is no direct geometric or group theoretic interpretation from the Zak transform.
Heisenberg manifold
The (continuous) Heisenberg group

 
  is the 3-dimensional Lie group that can be represented by triples of real numbers with multiplication rule


 
  The discrete Heisenberg group

 
  is the discrete subgroup of 
 
 
 
  whose elements are represented by the triples of integers. Considering 
 
 
 
  acts on 
 
 
 
  on the left, the quotient manifold

 
  is called the Heisenberg manifold. The Heisenberg group acts on the Heisenberg manifold on the right. The Haar measure

 
  on the Heisenberg group induces a right-translation-invariant measure on the Heisenberg manifold. The space of complex-valued square integrable functions on the Heisenberg manifold has a right-translation-invariant orthogonal decomposition:


 
  where


 
 .
Definition
The Weil‚ÄìBrezin map

 
  is the unitary transformation given by


 
  for every Schwartz function 
 
 
 
 , where convergence is pointwise.
The inverse of the Weil‚ÄìBrezin map 
 
 
 
  is given by


 
  for every smooth function 
 
 
 
  on the Heisenberg manifold that is in 
 
 
 
 .
Fundamental unitary representation of the Heisenberg group
For each real number 
 
 
 
 , the fundamental unitary representation

 
  of the Heisenberg group is an irreducible unitary representation of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  defined by


 
 . By Stone-von Neumann theorem, this is the unique irreducible representation up to unitary equivalence satisfying the canonical commutation relation


 
 . The fundamental representation 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  and the right translation 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  are intertwined by the Weil‚ÄìBrezin map


 
 . In other words, the fundamental representation 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  is unitarily equivalent to the right translation 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  through the Wei-Brezin map.
Relation to Fourier transform
Let 
 
 
 
  be the automorphism on the Heisenberg group given by


 
 . It naturally induces a unitary operator

 
 , then the Fourier transform


 
  as a unitary operator on 
 
 
 
 .
Plancherel theorem
The norm-preserving property of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , which is easily seen, yields the norm-preserving property of the Fourier transform, which is refer to as the Plancherel theorem.
Poisson summation formula
For any Schwartz function 
 
 
 
 ,


 
 . This is just the Poisson summation formula.
Relation to the finite Fourier transform
For each 
 
 
 
 , the subspace 
 
 
 
  can further be decomposed into right-translation-invariant orthogonal subspaces


 
  where


 
 . The left translation 
 
 
 
  is well-defined on 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are its eigenspaces.
The left translation 
 
 
 
  is well-defined on 
 
 
 
 , and the map


 
  is a unitary transformation.
For each 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , define the map 
 
 
 
  by


 
  for every Schwartz function 
 
 
 
 , where convergence is pointwise.



The inverse map 
 
 
 
  is given by


 
  for every smooth function 
 
 
 
  on the Heisenberg manifold that is in 
 
 
 
 .
Similarly, the fundamental unitary representation 
 
 
 
  of the Heisenberg group is unitarily equivalent to the right translation on 
 
 
 
  through 
 
 
 
 :


 
 . For any 
 
 
 
 ,


 
 .
For each 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
 . Consider the finite dimensional subspace 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  generated by 
 
 
 
  where


 
  Then the left translations 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  act on 
 
 
 
  and give rise to the irreducible representation of the finite Heisenberg group. The map 
 
 
 
  acts on 
 
 
 
  and gives rise to the finite Fourier transform



Nil-theta functions
Nil-theta functions are functions on the Heisenberg manifold that are analogous to the theta functions on the complex plane. The image of Gaussian functions under the Weil‚ÄìBrezin Map are nil-theta functions. There is a model7 of the finite Fourier transform defined with nil-theta functions, and the nice property of the model is that the finite Fourier transform is compatible with the algebra structure of the space of nil-theta functions.
Definition of nil-theta functions
Let 
 
 
 
  be the complexified Lie algebra of the Heisenberg group 
 
 
 
 . A basis of 
 
 
 
  is given by the left-invariant vector fields 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 :








 
  These vector fields are well-defined on the Heisenberg manifold 
 
 
 
 .
Introduce the notation 
 
 
 
 . For each 
 
 
 
 , the vector field 
 
 
 
  on the Heisenberg manifold can be thought of as a differential operator on 
 
 
 
  with the kernel generated by 
 
 
 
 .
We call


 
  the space of nil-theta functions of degree 
 
 
 
 .
Algebra structure of nil-theta functions
The nil-theta functions with pointwise multiplication on 
 
 
 
  form a graded algebra

 
  (here 
 
 
 
 ).
Auslander and Tolimieri showed that this graded algebra is isomorphic to


 
 , and that the finite Fourier transform (see the preceding section #Relation to the finite Fourier transform) is an automorphism of the graded algebra.
Relation to Jacobi theta functions
Let 
 
 
 
  be the Jacobi theta function. Then


 
 .
Higher order theta functions with characteristics
An entire function

 
  on 
 
 
 
  is called a theta function of order

 
 , period

 
  (
 
 
 
 ) and characteristic

 
  if it satisfies the following equations:



 
 ,


 
 .

The space of theta functions of order 
 
 
 
 , period 
 
 
 
  and characteristic 
 
 
 
  is denoted by 
 
 
 
 .


 
 . A basis of 
 
 
 
  is


 
 . These higher order theta functions are related to the nil-theta functions by
