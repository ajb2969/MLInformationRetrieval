Dialing scales

Dialing scales are used to layout the face of a sundial geometrically. They were proposed by Samuel Foster in 1638, and produced by George Serle and Anthony Thompson in 1658 on a ruler . There are two scales the latitude scale and the hour scale. They can be used to draw all gnomonic dials- and reverse engineer existing dials to discover their original intended location. 1
Description
The traditional scales (Foster scales) are drawn on a ruler. The hour scale shows 
 
 
 
  the latitude scale shows 
 
 
 
 . Other scales are in existence. 2
Usage
A right-angle is drawn on the dial-face and the latitude scale indicates a construction point on the x-axis. This is used to place the hour line to form a hypotenuse, each of the hour points are copied over to the dial face- a straight edge is used to connect them to the origin thus drawing the hour lines for that location. They can be used to draw all gnomonic dials- and reverse engineer existing dials to discover their original intended location. 3
