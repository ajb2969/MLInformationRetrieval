   Bifurcation diagram      Bifurcation diagram   In mathematics , particularly in dynamical systems , a bifurcation diagram shows the possible long-term values (equilibria/fixed points or periodic orbits ) of a system as a function of a bifurcation parameter in the system. It is usual to represent stable solutions with a solid line and unstable solutions with a dotted line.  Bifurcations in 1D discrete dynamical systems  Logistic map    An example is the bifurcation diagram of the logistic map :        x   n  +  1    =   r   x  n    (   1  -   x  n    )     .       subscript  x    n  1      r   subscript  x  n     1   subscript  x  n       x_{n+1}=rx_{n}(1-x_{n}).\,     The bifurcation parameter r is shown on the horizontal axis of the plot and the vertical axis shows the possible long-term population values of the logistic function.  The bifurcation diagram nicely shows the forking of the possible periods of stable orbits from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 etc. Each of these bifurcation points is a period-doubling bifurcation . The ratio of the lengths of successive intervals between values of r for which bifurcation occurs converges to the first Feigenbaum constant .  Real quadratic map  The map is     x   n  +  1    =    x  n  2   -  c        subscript  x    n  1       superscript   subscript  x  n   2   c     x_{n+1}=x_{n}^{2}-c   .  Symmetry breaking in bifurcation sets  (Figure)  Symmetry breaking in pitchfork bifurcation as the parameter epsilon is varied. epsilon = 0 is the case of symmetric pitchfork bifurcation.   In a dynamical system such as        x  ¨   +   f   (  x  ;  μ  )    +   ϵ  g   (  x  )     =  0         normal-¨  x     f   x  μ      ϵ  g  x    0    \ddot{x}+f(x;\mu)+\epsilon g(x)=0   ,  which is structurally stable when    μ  ≠  0      μ  0    \mu\neq 0   , if a bifurcation diagram is plotted, treating   μ   μ   \mu   as the bifurcation parameter, but for different values of   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   , the case    ϵ  =  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon=0   is the symmetric pitchfork bifurcation. When    ϵ  ≠  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon\neq 0   , we say we have a pitchfork with broken symmetry. This is illustrated in the animation on the right.
