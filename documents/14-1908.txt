Exportation (logic)

Exportation1234 is a valid rule of replacement in propositional logic. The rule allows conditional statements having conjunctive antecedents to be replaced by statements having conditional consequents and vice versa in logical proofs. It is the rule that:



Where "
 
 
 
 " is a metalogical symbol representing "can be replaced in a proof with."
Formal notation
The exportation rule may be written in sequent notation:



where 
 
 
 
  is a metalogical symbol meaning that 
 
 
 
  is a syntactic consequence of 
 
 
 
  in some logical system;
or in rule form:



where the rule is that wherever an instance of "
 
 
 
 " appears on a line of a proof, it can be replaced with "
 
 
 
 ";
or as the statement of a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:



where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are propositions expressed in some logical system.
Natural language
Truth values
At any time, if P→Q is true, it can be replaced by P→(P∧Q).
 One possible case for P→Q is for P to be true and Q to be true; thus P∧Q is also true, and P→(P∧Q) is true.
 Another possible case sets P as false and Q as true. Thus, P∧Q is false and P→(P∧Q) is false; false→false is true.
 The last case occurs when both P and Q are false. Thus, P∧Q is false and P→(P∧Q) is true.
Example
It rains and the sun shines implies that there is a rainbow.
 Thus, if it rains, then the sun shines implies that there is a rainbow.
Relation to functions
Exportation is associated with Currying via the Curry–Howard correspondence.
