   Exportation (logic)      Exportation (logic)   Exportation 1 2 3 4 is a valid  rule of replacement in propositional logic . The rule allows conditional statements having conjunctive  antecedents to be replaced by statements having conditional consequents and vice versa in logical proofs . It is the rule that:       (   (  P  and  Q  )   →  R  )   ⇔   (  P  →   (  Q  →  R  )   )      fragments   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(  P  and  Q  normal-)   normal-→  R  normal-)   normal-⇔   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→   fragments  normal-(  Q  normal-→  R  normal-)   normal-)     ((P\and Q)\to R)\Leftrightarrow(P\to(Q\to R))     Where "   ⇔   normal-⇔   \Leftrightarrow   " is a metalogical  symbol representing "can be replaced in a proof with."  Formal notation  The exportation rule may be written in sequent notation:       (   (  P  and  Q  )   →  R  )   ⊢   (  P  →   (  Q  →  R  )   )      fragments   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(  P  and  Q  normal-)   normal-→  R  normal-)   proves   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→   fragments  normal-(  Q  normal-→  R  normal-)   normal-)     ((P\and Q)\to R)\vdash(P\to(Q\to R))     where   ⊢   proves   \vdash   is a metalogical symbol meaning that    (  P  →   (  Q  →  R  )   )     fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→   fragments  normal-(  Q  normal-→  R  normal-)   normal-)    (P\to(Q\to R))   is a syntactic consequence of    (    (   P  and  Q   )   →  R   )     normal-→    P  italic- and  Q   R    ((P\and Q)\to R)   in some logical system ;  or in rule form :         (   P  and  Q   )   →  R    P  →   (  Q  →  R  )     .       normal-→    P  italic- and  Q   R    fragments  P  normal-→   fragments  normal-(  Q  normal-→  R  normal-)      \frac{(P\and Q)\to R}{P\to(Q\to R)}.     where the rule is that wherever an instance of "     (   P  and  Q   )   →  R     normal-→    P  italic- and  Q   R    (P\and Q)\to R   " appears on a line of a proof, it can be replaced with "    P  →   (  Q  →  R  )      fragments  P  normal-→   fragments  normal-(  Q  normal-→  R  normal-)     P\to(Q\to R)   ";  or as the statement of a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:        (   (  P  and  Q  )   →  R  )   )   →   (  P  →   (  Q  →  R  )   )   )     fragments   fragments   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(  P  and  Q  normal-)   normal-→  R  normal-)   normal-)   normal-→   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→   fragments  normal-(  Q  normal-→  R  normal-)   normal-)   normal-)    ((P\and Q)\to R))\to(P\to(Q\to R)))     where   P   P   P   ,   Q   Q   Q   , and   R   R   R   are propositions expressed in some logical system .  Natural language  Truth values  At any time, if P→Q is true, it can be replaced by P→(P∧Q). One possible case for P→Q is for P to be true and Q to be true; thus P∧Q is also true, and P→(P∧Q) is true. Another possible case sets P as false and Q as true. Thus, P∧Q is false and P→(P∧Q) is false; false→false is true. The last case occurs when both P and Q are false. Thus, P∧Q is false and P→(P∧Q) is true.  Example  It rains and the sun shines implies that there is a rainbow. Thus, if it rains, then the sun shines implies that there is a rainbow.  Relation to functions  Exportation is associated with Currying via the Curry–Howard correspondence .
