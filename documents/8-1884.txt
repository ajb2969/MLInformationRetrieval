   Spectral flatness      Spectral flatness    Spectral flatness or tonality coefficient , 1 2 also known as Wiener entropy , 3 4 is a measure used in digital signal processing to characterize an audio spectrum . Spectral flatness is typically measured in decibels , and provides a way to quantify how noise -like a sound is, as opposed to being tone -like. 5  The meaning of tonal in this context is in the sense of the amount of peaks or resonant structure in a power spectrum , as opposed to flat spectrum of a white noise . A high spectral flatness (approaching 1.0 for white noise) indicates that the spectrum has a similar amount of power in all spectral bands — this would sound similar to white noise, and the graph of the spectrum would appear relatively flat and smooth. A low spectral flatness (approaching 0.0 for a pure tone) indicates that the spectral power is concentrated in a relatively small number of bands — this would typically sound like a mixture of sine waves , and the spectrum would appear "spiky". 6  The spectral flatness is calculated by dividing the geometric mean of the power spectrum by the arithmetic mean of the power spectrum, i.e.:      Flatness  =      ∏   n  =  0    N  -  1     x   (  n  )     N       ∑   n  =  0    N  -  1      x   (  n  )     N    =    exp   (    1  N     ∑   n  =  0    N  -  1      ln  x    (  n  )      )      1  N     ∑   n  =  0    N  -  1     x   (  n  )             Flatness       N     superscript   subscript  product    n  0      N  1      x  n         superscript   subscript     n  0      N  1      x  n    N                 1  N     superscript   subscript     n  0      N  1        x   n          1  N     superscript   subscript     n  0      N  1      x  n         \mathrm{Flatness}=\frac{\sqrt[N]{\prod_{n=0}^{N-1}x(n)}}{\frac{\sum_{n=0}^{N-1%
 }x(n)}{N}}=\frac{\exp\left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\ln x(n)\right)}{\frac{1%
 }{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x(n)}     where x(n) represents the magnitude of bin number n . Note that a single (or more) empty bin yields a flatness of 0, so this measure is most useful when bins are generally not empty.  The ratio produced by this calculation is often converted to a decibel scale for reporting, with a maximum of 0 dB and a minimum of −∞ dB.  The spectral flatness can also be measured within a specified subband, rather than across the whole band.  Applications  This measurement is one of the many audio descriptors used in the MPEG-7 standard, in which it is labelled "AudioSpectralFlatness".  In birdsong research, it has been used as one of the features measured on birdsong audio, when testing similarity between two excerpts. 7  References  "  Category:Digital signal processing     ↩  ↩  The Song Features › Wiener entropy "defined as the ratio of geometric mean to arithmetic mean of the spectrum" ↩  Luscinia parameters "Wiener entropy is an alternative measure of the noisiness of a signal.
