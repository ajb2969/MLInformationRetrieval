   Gardner equation      Gardner equation   Gardner equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation set up by mathematician Clifford Gardner in 1968 to generalize KdV equation . Gardner equation has application in hydrodynamics, plasma physics and quantum field theory 1        ∂  u    ∂  t    +    (    2  *  a  *  u   -   3  *  b  *   u  2     )   *    ∂  u    ∂  x     +     ∂  3   u    ∂   x  3      =  0            u     t          2  a  u     3  b   superscript  u  2         u     x         superscript   3   u      superscript  x  3      0    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+(2*a*u-3*b*u^{2})*\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+%
