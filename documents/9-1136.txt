   Positive-definite function on a group      Positive-definite function on a group   In mathematics, and specifically in operator theory , a positive-definite function on a group relates the notions of positivity, in the context of Hilbert spaces , and algebraic groups . It can be viewed as a particular type of positive-definite kernel where the underlying set has the additional group structure.  Definition  Let G be a group, H be a complex Hilbert space, and L ( H ) be the bounded operators on H . A positive-definite function on G is a function  that satisfies         ∑    s  ,  t   ∈  G     ⟨   F   (    s   -  1    t   )   h   (  t  )    ,   h   (  s  )    ⟩    ≥  0   ,        subscript      s  t   G       F     superscript  s    1    t   h  t     h  s     0    \sum_{s,t\in G}\langle F(s^{-1}t)h(t),h(s)\rangle\geq 0,     for every function h : G → H with finite support ( h takes non-zero values for only finitely many s ).  In other words, a function F : G → L ( H ) is said to be a positive definite function if the kernel K : G × G → L ( H ) defined by K ( s , t ) = F ( s −1 t ) is a positive-definite kernel.  Unitary representations  A unitary representation is a unital homomorphism Φ: G → L ( H ) where Φ( s ) is a unitary operator for all s . For such Φ, Φ( s −1 ) = Φ( s )*.  Positive-definite functions on G are intimately related to unitary representations of G . Every unitary representation of G gives rise to a family of positive-definite functions. Conversely, given a positive-definite function, one can define a unitary representation of G in a natural way.  Let Φ: G → L ( H ) be a unitary representation of G . If P ∈ L ( H ) is the projection onto a closed subspace H` of H . Then F ( s ) = P Φ( s ) is a positive-definite function on G with values in L ( H` ). This can be shown readily:        ∑    s  ,  t   ∈  G      ⟨   F   (    s   -  1    t   )   h   (  t  )    ,   h   (  s  )    ⟩       subscript      s  t   G       F     superscript  s    1    t   h  t     h  s      \displaystyle\sum_{s,t\in G}\langle F(s^{-1}t)h(t),h(s)\rangle     for every h : G → H` with finite support. If G has a topology and Φ is weakly(resp. strongly) continuous, then clearly so is F .  On the other hand, consider now a positive-definite function F on G . A unitary representation of G can be obtained as follows. Let C 00 ( G , H ) be the family of functions h : G → H with finite support. The corresponding positive kernel K ( s , t ) = F ( s −1 t ) defines a (possibly degenerate) inner product on C 00 ( G , H ). Let the resulting Hilbert space be denoted by V .  We notice that the "matrix elements" K ( s , t ) = K ( a −1 s , a −1 t ) for all a , s , t in G . So U a h ( s ) = h ( a −1 s ) preserves the inner product on V , i.e. it is unitary in L ( V ). It is clear that the map Φ( a ) = U a is a representation of G on V .  The unitary representation is unique, up to Hilbert space isomorphism, provided the following minimality condition holds:      V  =    ⋁   s  ∈  G     Φ   (  s  )    H         V    subscript     s  G      normal-Φ  s  H      V=\bigvee_{s\in G}\Phi(s)H\,     where   ⋁     \bigvee   denotes the closure of the linear span.  Identify H as elements (possibly equivalence classes) in V , whose support consists of the identity element e ∈ G , and let P be the projection onto this subspace. Then we have PU a P = F ( a ) for all a ∈ G .  Toeplitz kernels  Let G be the additive group of integers Z . The kernel K ( n , m ) = F ( m − n ) is called a kernel of Toeplitz type, by analogy with Toeplitz matrices . If F is of the form F ( n ) = T n where T is a bounded operator acting on some Hilbert space. One can show that the kernel K ( n , m ) is positive if and only if T is a contraction . By the discussion from the previous section, we have a unitary representation of Z , Φ( n ) = U n for a unitary operator U . Moreover, the property PU a P = F ( a ) now translates to PU n P = T n . This is precisely Sz.-Nagy's dilation theorem and hints at an important dilation-theoretic characterization of positivity that leads to a parametrization of arbitrary positive-definite kernels.
