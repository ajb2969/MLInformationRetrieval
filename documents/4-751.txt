   Luce's choice axiom      Luce's choice axiom   In probability theory , Luce's choice axiom , formulated by R. Duncan Luce (1959), states that the probability of selecting one item over another from a pool of many items is not affected by the presence or absence of other items in the pool. Selection of this kind is said to have " independence from irrelevant alternatives " (IIA).  Overview  Mathematically, the axiom states that the probability of selecting item i from a pool of j items is given by:       P   (  i  )    =    w  i     âˆ‘  j    w  j           P  i      subscript  w  i     subscript   j    subscript  w  j       P(i)=\frac{w_{i}}{\sum_{j}{w_{j}}}     where w indicates the weight (a measure of some typically salient property) of a particular item.  Applications  The axiom is often encountered in economics , where it can be used to model a consumer 's tendency to choose one brand of product over another. It is also found in psychology , particularly in cognitive science where it is used to model approximately rational decision processes.
