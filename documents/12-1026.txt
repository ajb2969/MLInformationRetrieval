   List of Saxon locomotives and railcars      List of Saxon locomotives and railcars   (Figure)  caption|Flag of the Kingdom of Saxony   This list contains the locomotives and railbuses of the Royal Saxon State Railways ( Königlich Saxon Staatseisenbahnen ) and the locomotives of the Leipzig–Dresden Railway Company .  Leipzig-Dresden Railway  The Leipzig–Dresden Railway Company ( Leipzig-Dresdner Eisenbahn or LDE ) started up its operations between 1837 and 1839, successively opening its sections of line, and was therefore the first German long distance railway. It remained independent for nearly three decades and was only absorbed into the Royal Saxon State Railways on 1 June 1876.  The LDE locomotives were only classified by name.      style="color:#FFFFFF; background:#698B69" LDE name   style="color:#FFFFFF; background:#698B69" State railway class (to 1896)   style="color:#FFFFFF; background:#698B69" State railway number(s) (to 1892)   style="color:#FFFFFF; background:#698B69" Quantity   style="color:#FFFFFF; background:#698B69" Year(s) of manufacture   style="color:#FFFFFF; background:#698B69" Type   style="color:#FFFFFF; background:#698B69" Remarks       COLUMBUS     1   1835   B n2   Built by Winans (USA), so-called "Crab class"; given in payment for the locomotive PEGASUS in 1842     COMET and FAUST     2   1835–1837   B n2   Built by Rothwell (GB), driving wheel diameter 1372 mm; COMET rebuilt in 1842 into B1 n2, retired by 1848     BLITZ and WINDSBRAUT     2   1836–1837   B n2   Built by Rothwell (GB), driving wheel diameter 1524 mm; rebuilt in 1842 into B1 n2, retired by 1848     RENNER to GREIF     5   1837–1839   1A1 n2   Built by Kirtley (GB), retired by 1869     PETER ROTHWELL to NORDLICHT     6   1838–1840   1A1 n2   Built by Rothwell (GB), retired by 1864     ROBERT STEPHENSON     1   1838   1A1 n2   Built by Stephenson (GB), retired 1858     EDWARD BURY to PFEIL     4   1838   B n2   Built by Bury (GB), retired by 1854     SAXONIA     1   1838   B1 n2   Built by Übigau ; carrying axle removed in 1840/41 (B n2), 1844 mothballed     PEGASUS     1   1839   1A1 n2   Built by the Sächsische Maschinenfabrik Co., Chemnitz, bought in 1842 after lengthy trials; retired 1862     PHÖNIX     1   1840   1A1 n2   Built by Übigau , not bought after trials     BRÜSSEL     1   1842   1A1 n2   Built by Renard (B), retired 1860     DRESDEN to RIESA     3   1844–1846   1B n2   Built by Hawthorn (GB), retired by 1867     WURZEN and OSCHATZ     2   1847   1B n2   Built by Borsig , retired by 1868     ELBE to HAYN     5   1848–1849   1A1 n2   Built by Borsig , retired by 1868     RICHARD HARTMANN to ZWICKAU     3   1849   1A1 n2   Built by Hartmann , retired by 1868     COMET to SAALE   B II from 1886: B IIa   613–626   14   1852–1859   1B n2   Mixed traffic locomotives, built by Borsig     HAMBURG to BREMEN     4   1854   1A1 n2   Passenger train locomotives, built by Borsig ; 1873–1876 in B1 n2t and B1n2 rebuilt     SAXONIA to ALTHEN   H VIa, B VIa   544–571   28   1856–1868   1A1 n2   Express train locomotives, built by Hartmann and Borsig     BORSDORF to ZITTAU   K III from 1885: K II   584–603   20   1866–1868   1B n2   Mixed traffic locomotives, built by Esslingen     MOLDAU to MULDE   K III from 1885: K II   604–612   9   1874–1875   1B n2   Mixed traffic locomotives, built by Esslingen     MANNHEIM to DOLDENHORN   K V, Sigl V, Hsch V   514-543   30   1868–1876   C n2   Goods train locomotives, built by Esslingen , Sigl and Henschel     Nos. 3 to 6   W VII T   628–631   4   1874   B n2t   Shunting locomotives , built by Wöhlert     MEISSEN to WILHELM SEYFFERTH   Hsch VI   572–583   12   1875–1876   1B n2   Express train locomotives, built by Henschel      St II T   635–636   (2)   (1856)   1B n2t   Taken over in 1869 with the Großenhain – Priestewitz branch; appeared in 1856 as a rebuild of the Bavarian E.

This was usual on all engines up to 1892. From 1893 to 1900 only passenger and express train locomotives still carried name plates. Thereafter name plates on all locomotives, apart from old shunting and branch line engines, were removed.  Specific groups of names were supposed to be allocated to the different classes (e.g. rivers, alpine peaks, American cities).  In addition to their names the locomotives were given 'list numbers' ( Listennummern or Bahnnummern ) that were also displayed on the engines from 1869 onwards. A new numbering scheme was introduced in 1892, which attempted to bring in some sort of orderly system. However it was not successful.  Because this system was confusing and impractical with the ever rising quantity of locomotives, in 1869 a system of distinguishing between the individual classes was introduced in 1869. This system was based on an abbreviation of the manufacturer's name and a Roman numeral for each type of locomotive.  Only two years later this system was changed and the numbers were used to classify engines based on specific wheel arrangements, the manufacturer's abbreviations being retained. In addition the letters "a" (for alt = 'old') and "b" (for neu = 'new') were added.      Class   Type       I   1B with Long Boiler from 1845     II   1B with Long Boiler from 1845     III   1B with Long Boiler from 1852     IIIa   1B with low firebox , built in 1853     IIIb   1B passenger train locomotives, built in 1871     IV   1'B locomotives for mountain routes (including tank engines), from 1856     Va and V   C goods train locomotives from 1855     VI   1B fast stopping ( Eilzug ) locomotives from 1858     VIa   1A1 locomotives from 1848     VII   B mixed traffic locomotives from 1868     VIII   2'B locomotives from 1857       Later on, there were further changes to the classification system. Letters were introduced to indicate locomotive classes as follows:   F for Fairlie locomotives (from 1885)  M for Meyer locomotives (from 1889)  Kl for Klose locomotives (from 1889)   and as supplementary information (after the class number):   T for tank locomotives (from 1876)  K for 750-mm narrow gauge locomotives (sometimes also in front of the class number)  S for Sekundärbahn locomotives (from 1884)  O for omnibus train locomotives (from 1885)  C for compound ( Verbund ) locomotives (from 1887), replaced by...     𝔙   𝔙   \mathfrak{V}   for compound locomotives (from 1889)  M for metre gauge locomotives     ℌ   ℌ   \mathfrak{H}   for superheated locomotives.   In 1885 the supplementary letter "b" was given the meaning 'movable carrying axle '. The last major reorganisation of the classification system took place in 1896. The manufacturer's name was dropped. New classes of express train and goods train locomotives were given even class numbers and goods train , branch line and shunting locomotives were given odd numbers. Narrow gauge locomotives were given new class designations beginning with I. Locomotives of the same class however with different driving wheel diameters were given the additional number 1 (express train locomotives) and 2 (passenger train locomotives).
