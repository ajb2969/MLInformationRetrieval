   Stationary sequence      Stationary sequence   In probability theory – specifically in the theory of stochastic processes , a stationary sequence is a random sequence whose joint probability distribution is invariant over time. If a random sequence X  j is stationary then the following holds:        F     X  n   ,   X   n  +  1    ,  …  ,   X    n  +  N   -  1       (   x  n   ,   x   n  +  1    ,  …  ,   x    n  +  N   -  1    )        subscript  F    subscript  X  n    subscript  X    n  1    normal-…   subscript  X      n  N   1        subscript  x  n    subscript  x    n  1    normal-…   subscript  x      n  N   1       \displaystyle{}\quad F_{X_{n},X_{n+1},\dots,X_{n+N-1}}(x_{n},x_{n+1},\dots,x_{%
 n+N-1})     where F is the joint cumulative distribution function of the random variables in the subscript.  If a sequence is stationary then it is wide-sense stationary .  If a sequence is stationary then it has a constant mean (which may not be finite):        E   (   X   [  n  ]    )    =   μ   for all  n     .        E    X   delimited-[]  n      μ    for all  n      E(X[n])=\mu\quad\text{for all }n.
