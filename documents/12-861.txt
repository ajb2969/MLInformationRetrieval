Gauss–Laguerre quadrature

In numerical analysis Gauss–Laguerre quadrature is an extension of the Gaussian quadrature method for approximating the value of integrals of the following kind:



In this case



where xi is the i-th root of Laguerre polynomial Ln(x) and the weight wi is given by 1



For more general functions
To integrate the function 
 
 
 
  we apply the following transformation


 
  where 
 
 
 
 . For the last integral one then uses Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. Note, that while this approach works from an analytical perspective, it is not always numerically stable.
Generalized Gauss–Laguerre quadrature
More generally, one can also consider integrands that have a known 
 
 
 
  power-law singularity at x=0, for some real number 
 
 
 
 , leading to integrals of the form:


 
  This allows one to efficiently evaluate such integrals for polynomial or smooth f(x) even when α is not an integer.2
