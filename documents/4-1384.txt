Expenditure function

In microeconomics, the expenditure function gives the minimum amount of money an individual needs to spend to achieve some level of utility, given a utility function and the prices of the available goods.
Formally, if there is a utility function 
 
 
 
  that describes preferences over ''n '' commodities, the expenditure function



says what amount of money is needed to achieve a utility 
 
 
 
 
  if the n prices are given by the price vector 
 
 
 
 . This function is defined by



where



is the set of all bundles that give utility at least as good as 
 
 
 
 .
Expressed equivalently, the individual minimizes expenditure 
 
 
 
 
  subject to the minimal utility constraint that 
 
 
 
  giving optimal quantities to consume of the various goods as 
 
 
 
  as functions of 
 
 
 
  and the prices; then the expenditure function is
