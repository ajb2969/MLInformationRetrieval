Cocycle category

In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the cocyle category of objects X, Y in a model category is a category in which the objects are pairs of maps 
 
 
 
  and the morphisms are obvious commutative diagrams between them.1 It is denoted by 
 
 
 
 . (It may also be defined using the language of 2-category.)
One has: if the model category is right proper and is such that weak equivalences are closed under finite products,


 
  is bijective.
