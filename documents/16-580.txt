   Cocycle category      Cocycle category   In category theory , a branch of mathematics , the cocyle category of objects X , Y in a model category is a category in which the objects are pairs of maps    X   ←  𝑓   Z   →  𝑔   Y      X   f  normal-←   Z   g  normal-→   Y    X\overset{f}{\leftarrow}Z\overset{g}{\rightarrow}Y   and the morphisms are obvious commutative diagrams between them. 1 It is denoted by    H   (  X  ,  Y  )       H   X  Y     H(X,Y)   . (It may also be defined using the language of 2-category .)  One has: if the model category is right proper and is such that weak equivalences are closed under finite products,         π  0   H   (  X  ,  Y  )    →   [  X  ,  Y  ]    ,    (  f  ,  g  )   ↦   g  ∘   f   -  1         formulae-sequence   normal-→     subscript  π  0   H   X  Y     X  Y     maps-to   f  g     g   superscript  f    1        \pi_{0}H(X,Y)\to[X,Y],\quad(f,g)\mapsto g\circ f^{-1}   is bijective .
