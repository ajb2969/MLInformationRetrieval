FMN adenylyltransferase




FMN adenylyltransferase

In enzymology, a FMN adenylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + FMN 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + FAD
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and FMN, whereas its two products are diphosphate and FAD.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:FMN adenylyltransferase. This enzyme participates in riboflavin metabolism.
Other names
