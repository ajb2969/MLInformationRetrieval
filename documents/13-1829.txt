   4-Nitrochlorobenzene      4-Nitrochlorobenzene   4-Nitrochlorobenzene is the organic compound with the formula ClC 6 H 4 NO 2 . It is a pale yellow solid. 4-Nitrochlorobenzene is a common intermediate in the production of a number of industrially useful compounds, including common antioxidants found in rubber. Other isomers with the formula ClC 6 H 4 NO 2 include 2-nitrochlorobenzene and 3-nitrochlorobenzene.  Preparation  4-Nitrochlorobenzene is prepared industrially by nitration of chlorobenzene : 1        ClC  6    H  5    +   HNO  3    →     ClC  6    H  4    NO  2    +    H  2   O       normal-→       subscript  ClC  6    subscript  normal-H  5     subscript  HNO  3         subscript  ClC  6    subscript  normal-H  4    subscript  NO  2       subscript  normal-H  2   normal-O      \mathrm{ClC_{6}H_{5}+HNO_{3}\rightarrow ClC_{6}H_{4}NO_{2}+H_{2}O}     This reaction affords both the 2- and the 4-nitro derivatives, in about a 1:2 ratio. These isomers are separated by distillation. 4-Nitrochlorobenzene was originally prepared by the nitration of 4-bromochlorobenzene by Holleman and coworkers. 2  Applications  4-Nitrochlorobenzene is an intermediate in the preparation of a variety of derivatives. Nitration gives 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene , and 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene . Reduction with iron metal gives 4-chloroaniline . The electron-withdrawing nature of the appended nitro-group makes the benzene ring especially susceptible to nucleophilic aromatic substitution , unlike related chlorobenzene. Thus, the strong nucleophiles hydroxide, methoxide , and amide displace chloride to give respectively 4-nitrophenol , 4-nitroanisole, 4-nitroaniline . 3  Another major use of 4-nitrochlorobenzene is its condensation with aniline to produce 4-nitrodiphenylamine. Reductive alkylation of the nitro group affords secondary aryl amines, which are useful antioxidants for rubber.    Safety  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health considers 4-nitrochlorobenzene as a potential occupational carcinogen that may be absorbed through the skin. 4 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration set a permissible exposure limit of 1 mg/m 3 , while the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists recommends an airborne exposure limit of 0.64 mg/m 3 , over a time-weighted average of eight hours. 5 6  References  "  Category:Chloroarenes  Category:Nitrobenzenes      "The nitration of mixed dihalogen benzenes" Recueil des Travaux Chimiques des Pays-Bas et de la Belgique.
