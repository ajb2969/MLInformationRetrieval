   2-aminohexanoate transaminase      2-aminohexanoate transaminase   In enzymology , a 2-aminohexanoate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-2-aminohexanoate + 2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-oxohexanoate + L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-2-aminohexanoate and 2-oxoglutarate , whereas its two products are 2-oxohexanoate and L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-2-aminohexanoate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include norleucine transaminase , norleucine (leucine) aminotransferase , and leucine L-norleucine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  References     "  Category:EC 2.6.1  Category:Pyridoxal phosphate enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
