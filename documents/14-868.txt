   Liouville field theory      Liouville field theory   In physics , Liouville field theory (or simply Liouville theory ) is a two-dimensional quantum field theory whose classical equation of motion resembles the Joseph Liouville 's non-linear second order differential equation that appears in the classical geometrical problem of uniformizing Riemann surfaces . 1  The field theory is defined by the local action         S = \frac{1}{4\pi } \int d^2x \sqrt{g} (g^{\mu \nu} \partial _\mu \phi \partial _{\nu} \phi + (b+b^{-1}) R \phi + 4\pi e^{2b\phi }),  where     ∂  μ   =    ∂  /   ∂   x  μ     ,   g   μ  ν          subscript   μ          superscript  x  μ      subscript  g    μ  ν       \partial_{\mu}=\partial/\partial x^{\mu},\ g_{\mu\nu}   is the metric of the two-dimensional space on which the field theory is formulated,   R   R   R   is the Ricci scalar of such space, and   b   b   b   is a real coupling constant . The field   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is consequently dubbed the Liouville field.  The equation of motion associated to this action is         \Delta \phi(x) = \frac {1}{2} (b+b^{-1}) R(x) + 4\pi b e^{2b\phi (x)}  where    Δ  =    g   -   1  /  2       ∂  μ    (    g   1  /  2     g   μ  ν     ∂  ν    )         normal-Δ     superscript  g      1  2       subscript   μ      superscript  g    1  2     superscript  g    μ  ν     subscript   ν        \Delta=g^{-1/2}\partial_{\mu}(g^{1/2}g^{\mu\nu}\partial_{\nu})   is the D'Alembert operator in such space (see also Laplace–Beltrami operator ). In the case the metric of the space being the Euclidean metric , and using standard notation, it becomes the classical Liouville equation         \left(\frac{\partial ^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial y^2} \right) \phi (x,y) = 4\pi b e^{2b \phi (x,y)}  Liouville field theory is a conformal field theory that incarnates Weyl symmetry in a very special way. 2 Its central charge   c   c   c   is given in terms of the parameter appearing in the action through the expression    c  =   1  +   6    (   b  +   1  /  b    )   2         c    1    6   superscript    b    1  b    2       c=1+6(b+1/b)^{2}   . Liouville theory appears in the context of string theory when trying to formulate a non-critical version of the theory in the path integral formulation . 3 Also in the string theory context, if coupled to a free bosonic field Liouville field theory can be thought of as the theory describing string excitations in a two-dimensional space(time).  Liouville field theory is one of the best understood examples of what is called a non-rational conformal field theory , for which some observables have been computed explicitly. Such is the case of two-point and three-point correlation functions of primary operators on the topology of the sphere. 4 5 Explicit expressions for observables of the theory defined on other topologies, like the partition function on the torus and the one-point function on the disk, were also calculated in the recent years.  Liouville theory is also closely related to other problems in physics and mathematics, like two-dimensional quantum gravity , two-dimensional string theory, three-dimensional general relativity in negatively curved spaces, four-dimensional superconformal gauge theories , the uniformization problem of Riemann surfaces, and other problems in conformal mapping. It is also connected to other two-dimensional non-rational conformal field theories with affine symmetry, like the Wess–Zumino–Novikov–Witten theory for the group    S  L   (  2  ,  R  )       S  L   2  R     SL(2,R)   , and, besides, it can be regarded as a special case (namely the case    N  =  1      N  1    N=1   ) of the family of    A  N     subscript  A  N    A_{N}    Toda field theories . Liouville theory also admits supersymmetric extension. 6 7  See also   Liouville gravity  Liouville's theorem  Conformal field theory  String theory   References  "  Category:Quantum field theory  Category:Conformal field theory  Category:String theory  Category:Differential geometry     Lützen, J.
