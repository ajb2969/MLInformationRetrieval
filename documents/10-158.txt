Caloric polynomial

In differential equations, the mth-degree caloric polynomial (or heat polynomial) is a "parabolically m-homogeneous" polynomial Pm(x, t) that satisfies the heat equation



"Parabolically m-homogeneous" means



The polynomial is given by



It is unique up to a factor.
With t = −1, this polynomial reduces to the mth-degree Hermite polynomial in x.
