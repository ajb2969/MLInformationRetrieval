   Caloric polynomial      Caloric polynomial   In differential equations , the m th-degree caloric polynomial (or heat polynomial ) is a "parabolically m -homogeneous" polynomial P m ( x , t ) that satisfies the heat equation         ∂  P    ∂  t    =     ∂  2   P    ∂   x  2      .

"Parabolically m -homogeneous" means       P   (   λ  x   ,    λ  2   t   )    =    λ  m   P   (  x  ,  t  )   for  λ   >   0.
