Uronate dehydrogenase




Uronate dehydrogenase

In enzymology, an uronate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-galacturonate + NAD+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-galactarate + NADH + H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are D-galacturonate, NAD+, and H2O, whereas its 3 products are D-galactarate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is uronate:NAD+ 1-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include uronate: NAD-oxidoreductase, and uronic acid dehydrogenase.
