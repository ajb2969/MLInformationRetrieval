   Mode volume      Mode volume   In fiber optics , mode volume is the number of bound modes that an optical fiber is capable of supporting.  The mode volume M is approximately given by $4V^2 \over \pi^2$ and ${V^2 \over 2} \left({g \over g+2}\right)$ , respectively for step-index and power-law index profile fibers, where g is the profile parameter, and V is the normalized frequency , which must be greater than 5 for this approximation to be valid .
