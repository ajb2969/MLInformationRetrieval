W-algebra

In mathematics, a W-algebra is a structure in conformal field theory related to generalizations of the Virasoro algebra. They were introduced by , and the name "W-algebra" comes from the fact that Zamolodchikov used the letter W for one of the elements of one of his examples.
There are at least three different but related notions called W-algebras: classical W-algebras, quantum W-algebras, and finite W-algebras.
Classical W-algebras
Performing classical Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction on a Lie algebra provides the Poisson bracket on this algebra.
Quantum W-algebras
defines a (quantum) W-algebra to be a meromorphic conformal field theory (roughly a vertex operator algebra) together with a distinguished set of generators satisfying various properties.
They can be constructed from a Lie (super)algebra by quantum Drinfeld–Sokolov reduction. Another approach is to look for other conserved currents besides the Stress–energy tensor in a similar manner to how the Virasoro algebra can be read off from the expansion of the stress tensor.
Finite W-algebras
compares several different definitions of finite W-algebras, which are certain associative algebras associated to nilpotent elements of semisimple Lie algebras.
The original definition, provided by Alexander Premet, starts with a pair 
 
 
 
  consisting of a reductive Lie algebra 
 
 
 
  over the complex numbers and a nilpotent element e. By the Jacobson-Morozov theorem, e is part of an sl2 triple (e,h,f). The eigenspace decomposition of ad(h) induces a 
 
 
 
 -grading on g:






\mathfrak{g} = \bigoplus \mathfrak{g} (i). 
Define a character

 
  (i.e. a homomorphism from g to the trivial 1-dimensional Lie algebra) by the rule 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the Killing form. This induces a non-degenerate anti-symmetric bilinear form on the -1 graded piece by the rule:






\omega_\chi (x,y) = \chi ( [x,y] ). 
After choosing any Lagrangian subspace

 
 , we may define the following nilpotent subalgebra which acts on the universal enveloping algebra by the adjoint action.






\mathfrak{m} = l + \bigoplus_{i \leq -2} \mathfrak{g} (i). 
The left ideal

 
  of the universal enveloping algebra

 
  generated by 
 
 
 
  is invariant under this action. It follows from a short calculation that the invariants in 
 
 
 
  under ad
 
 
 
  inherit the associative algebra structure from 
 
 
 
 . The invariant subspace 
 
 
 
  is called the finite W-algebra constructed from (g,e) and is usually denoted 
 
 
 
 .
