   W-algebra      W-algebra   In mathematics, a W-algebra is a structure in conformal field theory related to generalizations of the Virasoro algebra . They were introduced by , and the name "W-algebra" comes from the fact that Zamolodchikov used the letter W for one of the elements of one of his examples.  There are at least three different but related notions called W-algebras: classical W-algebras, quantum W-algebras, and finite W-algebras.  Classical W-algebras  Performing classical Drinfeld -Sokolov reduction on a Lie algebra provides the Poisson bracket on this algebra.  Quantum W-algebras  defines a (quantum) W-algebra to be a meromorphic  conformal field theory (roughly a vertex operator algebra ) together with a distinguished set of generators satisfying various properties.  They can be constructed from a Lie (super)algebra by quantum Drinfeld–Sokolov reduction. Another approach is to look for other conserved currents besides the Stress–energy tensor in a similar manner to how the Virasoro algebra can be read off from the expansion of the stress tensor.  Finite W-algebras  compares several different definitions of finite W-algebras, which are certain associative algebras associated to nilpotent elements of semisimple Lie algebras.  The original definition, provided by Alexander Premet, starts with a pair    (  𝔤  ,  e  )     𝔤  e    (\mathfrak{g},e)   consisting of a reductive Lie algebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   over the complex numbers and a nilpotent element e. By the Jacobson-Morozov theorem , e is part of an sl 2 triple (e,h,f). The eigenspace decomposition of ad(h) induces a   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   -grading on g:         \mathfrak{g} = \bigoplus \mathfrak{g} (i).  Define a character    χ   χ   \chi   (i.e. a homomorphism from g to the trivial 1-dimensional Lie algebra) by the rule     χ   (  x  )    =   κ   (  e  ,  x  )          χ  x     κ   e  x      \chi(x)=\kappa(e,x)   , where   κ   κ   \kappa   denotes the Killing form . This induces a non-degenerate anti-symmetric bilinear form on the -1 graded piece by the rule:         \omega_\chi (x,y) = \chi ( [x,y] ).  After choosing any Lagrangian subspace    l   l   l   , we may define the following nilpotent subalgebra which acts on the universal enveloping algebra by the adjoint action .         \mathfrak{m} = l + \bigoplus_{i \leq -2} \mathfrak{g} (i).  The left ideal    I   I   I   of the universal enveloping algebra     U   (  𝔤  )       U  𝔤    U(\mathfrak{g})   generated by    {   x  -   χ   (  x  )     :   x  ∈  𝔪   }     conditional-set    x    χ  x      x  𝔪     \{x-\chi(x):x\in\mathfrak{m}\}   is invariant under this action. It follows from a short calculation that the invariants in     U   (  𝔤  )    /  I        U  𝔤   I    U(\mathfrak{g})/I   under ad    (  𝔪  )    𝔪   (\mathfrak{m})   inherit the associative algebra structure from    U   (  𝔤  )       U  𝔤    U(\mathfrak{g})   . The invariant subspace     (    U   (  𝔤  )    /  I   )    ad   (  𝔪  )       superscript      U  𝔤   I     ad  𝔪     (U(\mathfrak{g})/I)^{\text{ad}(\mathfrak{m})}   is called the finite W-algebra constructed from (g,e) and is usually denoted    U   (  𝔤  ,  e  )       U   𝔤  e     U(\mathfrak{g},e)   .
