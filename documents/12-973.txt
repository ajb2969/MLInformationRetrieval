   UNIQUAC      UNIQUAC    UNIQUAC (short for UNI versal QUA si C hemical) is an activity coefficient model used in description of phase equilibria. 1 The model is a so-called lattice model and has been derived from a first order approximation of interacting molecule surfaces in statistical thermodynamics. The model is however not fully thermodynamically consistent due to its two liquid mixture approach. In this approach the local concentration around one central molecule is assumed to be independent from the local composition around another type of molecule.  It has been shown that while the local compositions are correlated, ignoring this correlation gives little effect on the correlation of activity coefficients. 2 Today the UNIQUAC model is frequently applied in the description of phase equilibria (i.e. liquid–solid, liquid–liquid or liquid–vapor equilibrium). The UNIQUAC model also serves as the basis of the development of the group contribution method UNIFAC , where molecules are subdivided in atomic groups. In fact, UNIQUAC is equal to UNIFAC for mixtures of molecules, which are not subdivided; e.g. the binary systems water-methanol, methanol-acryonitrile and formaldehyde-DMF.  A more thermodynamically consistent form of UNIQUAC is given by the more recent COSMOSPACE and the equivalent GEQUAC model. 3  Equations  In the UNIQUAC model the activity coefficients of the i th component of a two component mixture are described by a combinatorial and a residual contribution.       ln   γ  i    =    ln   γ  i  C    +   ln   γ  i  R            subscript  γ  i         subscript   superscript  γ  C   i       subscript   superscript  γ  R   i       \ln\gamma_{i}=\ln\gamma^{C}_{i}+\ln\gamma^{R}_{i}     The first is an entropic term quantifying the deviation from ideal solubility as a result of differences in molecule shape. The latter is an enthalpic 4 correction caused by the change in interacting forces between different molecules upon mixing.  Combinatorial contribution  The combinatorial contribution accounts for shape differences between molecules and affects the entropy of the mixture and is based on the lattice theory. The excess entropy γ C is calculated exclusively from the pure chemical parameters, using the relative Van der Waals volumes r i and surface areas q i  5 of the pure chemicals.       ln   γ  i  C    =    (    1  -   V  i    +   ln   V  i     )   -    z  2    q  i    (    1  -    V  i    F  i     +   ln    V  i    F  i      )            superscript   subscript  γ  i   C          1   subscript  V  i       subscript  V  i         z  2    subscript  q  i       1     subscript  V  i    subscript  F  i          subscript  V  i    subscript  F  i          \ln\gamma_{i}^{C}=(1-V_{i}+\ln V_{i})-\frac{z}{2}q_{i}\left(1-\frac{V_{i}}{F_{%
 i}}+\ln\frac{V_{i}}{F_{i}}\right)    With the volume fraction per mixture mole fraction, V i , for the i th component given by:      V  i   =    r  i      ∑  j      r  j    x  j           subscript  V  i      subscript  r  i     subscript   j      subscript  r  j    subscript  x  j        V_{i}=\frac{r_{i}}{\sum_{j}r_{j}x_{j}}    And the surface area fraction per mixture molar fraction, F i , for the i th component given by:      F  i   =    q  i      ∑  j      q  j    x  j           subscript  F  i      subscript  q  i     subscript   j      subscript  q  j    subscript  x  j        F_{i}=\frac{q_{i}}{\sum_{j}q_{j}x_{j}}    The first 3 terms on the right hand side of the combinatorial term form the Flory-Huggins contribution, while the left terms, the Guggenhem-Staverman correction, reduce this because a connecting segments cannot be placed in all direction in space. This spatial correction shifts the result of the Flory-Huggins term about 5% towards an ideal solution. The coordination number, z, i.e. the number of close interacting molecules around a central molecule, is frequently set to 10. It can be regarded as an average value that lies between cubic (z=6) and hexagonal packing (z=12) of molecules that are simplified by spheres.  In the limit of infinite dilution and a binary mixture the equations for the combinatorial contribution reduces to:      {       ln   γ  1   C  ,  ∞     =     1  -     r  1    r  2      +   ln     r  1    r  2       -     z  2     q  1    (    1  -      r  1    q  2      r  2    q  1       +   ln      r  1    q  2      r  2    q  1        )             ln   γ  2   C  ,  ∞     =     1  -     r  2    r  1      +   ln     r  2    r  1       -     z  2     q  2    (    1  -      r  2    q  1      r  1    q  2       +   ln      r  2    q  1      r  1    q  2        )             cases       superscript   subscript  γ  1    C            1     subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2          subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2          z  2    subscript  q  1       1       subscript  r  1    subscript  q  2       subscript  r  2    subscript  q  1             subscript  r  1    subscript  q  2       subscript  r  2    subscript  q  1          otherwise       superscript   subscript  γ  2    C            1     subscript  r  2    subscript  r  1          subscript  r  2    subscript  r  1          z  2    subscript  q  2       1       subscript  r  2    subscript  q  1       subscript  r  1    subscript  q  2             subscript  r  2    subscript  q  1       subscript  r  1    subscript  q  2          otherwise    \begin{cases}\ln\gamma_{1}^{C,\infty}=1-\dfrac{r_{1}}{r_{2}}+\ln\dfrac{r_{1}}{%

The expression for the residual activity coefficient for molecule i is:       ln   γ  i  R    =    q  i    (   1  -   ln      ∑  j      q  j    x  j    τ   j  i         ∑  j      q  j    x  j       -    ∑  j      q  j    x  j    τ   i  j        ∑  k      q  k    x  k    τ   k  j         )           superscript   subscript  γ  i   R       subscript  q  i     1        subscript   j      subscript  q  j    subscript  x  j    subscript  τ    j  i        subscript   j      subscript  q  j    subscript  x  j         subscript   j        subscript  q  j    subscript  x  j    subscript  τ    i  j       subscript   k      subscript  q  k    subscript  x  k    subscript  τ    k  j            \ln\gamma_{i}^{R}=q_{i}\left(1-\ln\frac{\sum_{j}q_{j}x_{j}\tau_{ji}}{\sum_{j}q%

Theory defines Δu ij = u ij – u ii , and Δu ji = u ji – u jj , where u ij is the interaction energy between molecules i and j.  Usually Δu ij ≠ Δu ji , because the energies of evaporation (i.e. u ii ), are in many cases different, while the energy of interaction between molecule i and j is symmetric, and therefore u ij =u ji . If the interactions between the j molecules and i molecules is the same as between molecules i and j, than mixing has no excess energy effect upon mixing, Δu ij =Δu ji =0. And thus     γ  i  R   =  1       superscript   subscript  γ  i   R   1    \gamma_{i}^{R}=1     Alternatively, in some process simulation software    τ   i  j      subscript  τ    i  j     \tau_{ij}   can be expressed as follows :       ln   τ   i  j     =    A   i  j    +    B   i  j    /  T   +    C   i  j     ln   (  T  )     +    D   i  j    T   +    E   i  j    /   T  2            subscript  τ    i  j        subscript  A    i  j       subscript  B    i  j    T      subscript  C    i  j      T       subscript  D    i  j    T      subscript  E    i  j     superscript  T  2       \ln\tau_{ij}=A_{ij}+B_{ij}/T+C_{ij}\ln(T)+D_{ij}T+E_{ij}/T^{2}   .  The "C", "D", and "E" coefficients are primarily used in fitting liquid–liquid equilibria (with "D" and "E" rarely used at that). The "C" coefficient is useful in vapor-liquid equilibria as well. The use of such an expression ignores the fact that on a molecular level the energy, Δu ij , is temperature independent. It is a correction to repair the simplifications, which were applied in the derivation of the model.  Applications  Activity coefficients can be used to predict simple phase equilibria (vapour–liquid, liquid–liquid, solid–liquid), or to estimate other physical properties (e.g. viscosity of mixtures). Models such as UNIQUAC allow chemical engineers to predict the phase behavior of multicomponent chemical mixtures. They are commonly used in process simulation programs to calculate the mass balance in and around separation units.  Parameters  UNIQUAC requires two basic underlying parameters:   Relative surface and volume fractions are chemical constants, which must be known for all chemicals.  An empirical parameter between components that describes the intermolecular behaviour. This parameter must be known for all binary pairs in the mixture. In a quaternary mixture there are six such parameters (1–2,1–3,1–4,2–3,2–4,3–4) and the number rapidly increases with additional chemical components. The empirical parameters are derived from experimental activity coefficients, or from phase diagrams, from which the activity coefficients themselves can be calculated. An alternative is to obtain activity coefficients with a method such as UNIFAC , and the UNIFAC parameters can then be simplified by fitting to obtain the UNIQUAC parameters. This method allows for the more rapid calculation of activity coefficients, rather than direct usage of the more complex method.   Newer developments  UNIQUAC has been extended by several research groups. Some selected derivatives are:   UNIFAC : A method which permits the volume, surface and in particular, the binary interaction parameters to be estimated. This eliminates the use of experimental data to calculate the UNIQUAC parameters.
