   Mathematics of oscillation      Mathematics of oscillation   (Figure)  Oscillation of a sequence (shown in blue) is the difference between the limit superior and limit inferior of the sequence.   The mathematics of oscillation deals with the quantification of the amount that a sequence or function tends to move between extremes. There are several related notions: oscillation of a sequence of real numbers , oscillation of a real valued function at a point, and oscillation of a function on an interval (or open set ).  Definitions  Oscillation of a sequence  Let (    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   ) be a sequence of real numbers. The oscillation    ω   (   a  n   )       ω   subscript  a  n     \omega(a_{n})   of that sequence is defined as the difference (possibly infinite) between the limit superior and limit inferior of    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   :        ω   (   a  n   )    =    lim   sup   a  n     -   lim   inf   a  n       .        ω   subscript  a  n         supremum   subscript  a  n        infimum   subscript  a  n        \omega(a_{n})=\lim\sup a_{n}-\lim\inf a_{n}.     The oscillation is zero if and only if the sequence converges. It is undefined if    lim   sup   a  n         supremum   subscript  a  n      \lim\sup a_{n}   and    lim   inf   a  n         infimum   subscript  a  n      \lim\inf a_{n}   are both equal to +∞ or both equal to −∞, that is, if the sequence tends to +∞ or −∞.  Oscillation of a function on an open set  Let   f   f   f   be a real-valued function of a real variable. The oscillation of   f   f   f   on an interval   I   I   I   in its domain is the difference between the supremum and infimum of   f   f   f   :         ω  f    (  I  )    =     sup   x  ∈  I     f   (  x  )     -    inf   x  ∈  I     f   (  x  )       .         subscript  ω  f   I       subscript  supremum    x  I      f  x      subscript  infimum    x  I      f  x       \omega_{f}(I)=\sup_{x\in I}f(x)-\inf_{x\in I}f(x).   More generally, if    f  :   X  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  ℝ     f:X\to\mathbb{R}   is a function on a topological space    X   X   X   (such as a metric space ), then the oscillation of   f   f   f   on an open set    U   U   U   is         ω  f    (  U  )    =     sup   x  ∈  U     f   (  x  )     -    inf   x  ∈  U     f   (  x  )       .         subscript  ω  f   U       subscript  supremum    x  U      f  x      subscript  infimum    x  U      f  x       \omega_{f}(U)=\sup_{x\in U}f(x)-\inf_{x\in U}f(x).     Oscillation of a function at a point  The oscillation of a function   f   f   f   of a real variable at a point    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   is defined as the limit as    ϵ  →  0     normal-→  ϵ  0    \epsilon\to 0   of the oscillation of   f   f   f   on an   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   -neighborhood of    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   :         ω  f    (   x  0   )    =    lim   ϵ  →  0      ω  f    (    x  0   -  ϵ   ,    x  0   +  ϵ   )      .         subscript  ω  f    subscript  x  0      subscript    normal-→  ϵ  0       subscript  ω  f       subscript  x  0   ϵ      subscript  x  0   ϵ        \omega_{f}(x_{0})=\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\omega_{f}(x_{0}-\epsilon,x_{0}+\epsilon).   This is the same as the difference between the limit superior and limit inferior of the function at    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   , provided the point    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   is not excluded from the limits.  More generally, if    f  :   X  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  ℝ     f:X\to\mathbb{R}   is a real-valued function on a metric space , then the oscillation is         ω  f    (   x  0   )    =    lim   ϵ  →  0      ω  f    (    B  ϵ    (   x  0   )    )      .         subscript  ω  f    subscript  x  0      subscript    normal-→  ϵ  0       subscript  ω  f      subscript  B  ϵ    subscript  x  0        \omega_{f}(x_{0})=\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\omega_{f}(B_{\epsilon}(x_{0})).     Examples  (Figure)  As the argument of ƒ approaches point P , ƒ oscillates from ƒ (a) to ƒ (b) infinitely many times, and does not converge.    1/ x has oscillation ∞ at x = 0, and oscillation 0 at other finite x and at −∞ and +∞.  sin (1/ x ) (the topologist's sine curve ) has oscillation 2 at x = 0, and 0 elsewhere.  sin x has oscillation 0 at every finite x , and 2 at −∞ and +∞.  The sequence 1, −1, 1, −1, 1, −1, ... has oscillation 2.   In the last example the sequence is periodic , and any sequence that is periodic without being constant will have non-zero oscillation. However, non-zero oscillation does not usually indicate periodicity.  Geometrically, the graph of an oscillating function on the real numbers follows some path in the xy -plane, without settling into ever-smaller regions. In well-behaved cases the path might look like a loop coming back on itself, that is, periodic behaviour; in the worst cases quite irregular movement covering a whole region.  Continuity  Oscillation can be used to define continuity of a function , and is easily equivalent to the usual ε - δ definition (in the case of functions defined everywhere on the real line): a function ƒ is continuous at a point x 0 if and only if the oscillation is zero; 1 in symbols,      ω  f    (   x  0   )    =  0.         subscript  ω  f    subscript  x  0    0.    \omega_{f}(x_{0})=0.   A benefit of this definition is that it quantifies discontinuity: the oscillation gives how much the function is discontinuous at a point.  For example, in the classification of discontinuities :   in a removable discontinuity, the distance that the value of the function is off by is the oscillation;  in a jump discontinuity, the size of the jump is the oscillation (assuming that the value at the point lies between these limits from the two sides);  in an essential discontinuity, oscillation measures the failure of a limit to exist.   This definition is useful in descriptive set theory to study the set of discontinuities and continuous points – the continuous points are the intersection of the sets where the oscillation is less than ε (hence a G δ set ) – and gives a very quick proof of one direction of the Lebesgue integrability condition . 2  The oscillation is equivalence to the ε - δ definition by a simple re-arrangement, and by using a limit ( lim sup , lim inf ) to define oscillation: if (at a given point) for a given ε 0 there is no δ that satisfies the ε - δ definition, then the oscillation is at least ε 0 , and conversely if for every ε there is a desired δ, the oscillation is 0. The oscillation definition can be naturally generalized to maps from a topological space to a metric space.  Generalizations  More generally, if f : X → Y is a function from a topological space  X into a metric space  Y , then the oscillation of f is defined at each x ∈ X by       ω   (  x  )    =   inf   {   diam   (   f   (  U  )    )    ∣    U    is    a    neighborhood    of   x   }          ω  x    infimum   conditional-set    diam    f  U      U  is  normal-a  neighborhood  of  x       \omega(x)=\inf\left\{\mathrm{diam}(f(U))\mid U\mathrm{\ is\ a\ neighborhood\ %
