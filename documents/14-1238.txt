   Satake isomorphism      Satake isomorphism   In mathematics, the Satake isomorphism , introduced by , identifies the Hecke algebra of a reductive group over a local field with a ring of invariants of the Weyl group . The geometric Satake equivalence is a geometric version of the Satake isomorphism, introduced by .  Statement  Let G be a Chevalley group , K be a non-Archimedean local field and O be its ring of integers. Then the Satake isomorphism identifies the Grothendieck group of complex representations of the Langlands dual of G , with the ring of G(O) invariant compactly supported functions on the affine Grassmannian. In formulas:         ℂ  c     [     G   (  K  )    /  G    (  O  )    ]    G   (  O  )      ≅    K  0    (    G  L   -   R  e  p    )     .         subscript  ℂ  c    superscript   delimited-[]        G  K   G   O      G  O        subscript  K  0      superscript  G  L     R  e  p       \mathbb{C}_{c}[G(K)/G(O)]^{G(O)}\cong K_{0}(G^{L}-Rep).     Here G(O) acts on G(K) / G(O) by multiplication from the left.  Notes  References        "  Category:Representation theory
