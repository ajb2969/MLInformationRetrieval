   Reduced dynamics      Reduced dynamics   In quantum mechanics , especially in the study of open quantum systems , reduced dynamics refers to the time evolution of a density matrix for a system coupled to an environment. Consider a system and environment initially in the state     ρ   S  E     (  0  )        subscript  ρ    S  E    0    \rho_{SE}(0)\,   (which in general may be entangled ) and undergoing unitary evolution given by     U  t      subscript  U  t    U_{t}\,   . Then the reduced dynamics of the system alone is simply        ρ  S    (  t  )    =    Tr  E    [    U  t    ρ   S  E     (  0  )    U  t  †    ]           subscript  ρ  S   t      subscript  Tr  E    delimited-[]     subscript  U  t    subscript  ρ    S  E    0   superscript   subscript  U  t   normal-†        \rho_{S}(t)=\mathrm{Tr}_{E}[U_{t}\rho_{SE}(0)U_{t}^{\dagger}]   If we assume that the mapping      ρ  S    (  0  )    ↦    ρ  S    (  t  )       maps-to     subscript  ρ  S   0      subscript  ρ  S   t     \rho_{S}(0)\mapsto\rho_{S}(t)   is linear and completely positive , then the reduced dynamics can be represented by a quantum operation . This mean we can express it in the operator-sum form       ρ  S   =    ∑  i     F  i    ρ  S    (  0  )    F  i  †          subscript  ρ  S     subscript   i      subscript  F  i    subscript  ρ  S   0   superscript   subscript  F  i   normal-†       \rho_{S}=\sum_{i}F_{i}\rho_{S}(0)F_{i}^{\dagger}   where the     F  i      subscript  F  i    F_{i}\,   are operators on the Hilbert space of the system alone, and no reference is made to the environment. In particular, if the system and environment are initially in a product state      ρ   S  E     (  0  )    =      ρ  S    (  0  )    ⊗   ρ  E     (  0  )           subscript  ρ    S  E    0      tensor-product     subscript  ρ  S   0    subscript  ρ  E    0     \rho_{SE}(0)=\rho_{S}(0)\otimes\rho_{E}(0)   , it can be shown that the reduced dynamics are completely positive. However, the most general possible reduced dynamics are not completely positive. 1  Notes    References   Nielsen, Michael A. and Isaac L. Chuang (2000).
