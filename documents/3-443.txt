Pathological (mathematics)

 In mathematics, a pathological phenomenon is one whose properties are considered atypically bad or counterintuitive; the opposite is well-behaved. A notable case is the Alexander horned sphere, a counterexample showing that topologically embedding the sphere S2 in R3 may fail to "separate the space cleanly", unless an extra condition of tameness is used to suppress possible wild behaviour. See Jordan-Schönflies theorem.
Pathological functions
A classic example is the Weierstrass function, which is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere. The sum of a differentiable function and the Weierstrass function is again continuous but nowhere differentiable; so there are at least as many such functions as differentiable functions. In fact, by the Baire category theorem one can show that continuous functions are typically or generically nowhere differentiable.
In layman's terms, this is because of the great number of possible functions; the majority are nowhere differentiable, and relatively few can ever be described and studied, of which most that are interesting or useful also turn out to be well-behaved. To quote Henri Poincaré:
This highlights the fact that the term pathological is subjective or at least context-dependent, and its meaning in any particular case resides in the community of mathematicians, not necessarily within the subject matter of mathematics itself.
Prevalence
In cases of pathology, often "most" or "almost all" examples of a phenomenon are pathological, which is formalized by measures of size such as cardinality, measure (almost everywhere), probability (almost surely), or a generic property. For example, the set of rational numbers is countable (and has measure zero, and is a meagre set), but the set of irrational numbers is uncountable (and has full measure, and is a comeagre set): "almost all" real numbers are irrational, in these senses. In this case, pathologies are not the rare exceptions but the most common.
Pathological examples
Pathological examples often have some undesirable or unusual properties that make it difficult to contain or explain within a theory. Such pathological behaviour often prompts new investigation which leads to new theory and more general results. For example, some important historical examples of this are the following:

The discovery of irrational numbers by the school of Pythagoras in ancient Greece; for example, the length of the diagonal of a unit square, that is 
 
 

The cardinality of the rational numbers is equal to the cardinality of the integers.
Some number fields have rings of integers that do not form a unique factorization domain, for example the field 
 
 
 
 .
The discovery of fractals and other "rough" geometric objects (see Hausdorff dimension).
Weierstrass function, a real-valued function on the real line, that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.
Test functions in real analysis and distribution theory, which are infinitely differentiable functions on the real line that are 0 everywhere outside of a given limited interval. An example of such a function is the test function,

$$\varphi(t) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc}e^{-\frac{1}{1-t^2}},&-1
 
 *The [[Cantor set]] is a subset of the interval [0, 1] that has [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] zero but is [[uncountable]].
 *The Peano [[space-filling curve]] is a continuous [[surjective]] function that maps the unit interval [0, 1] onto [0, 1] × [0, 1].
 *The [[Dirichlet function]], which is the [[indicator function]] for rationals, is a bounded function that is not [[Riemann integrable]]. 
 *The [[Cantor function]] is a [[monotonic]] continuous surjective function that maps [0,1] onto [0,1] but has zero derivative [[almost everywhere]]
 
 At the time of their discovery, each of these was considered highly pathological; today, each has been assimilated into modern mathematical theory. These examples prompt their observers to correct their beliefs or intuitions; sometimes they may even necessitate a reassessment of foundational definitions and concepts. Over the course of history, they have led to more correct, more precise, and more powerful mathematics. For example, the Dirichlet function is Lebesgue integrable, and convolution with test functions is used to approximate any locally integrable function by smooth functions. (The approximations converge almost everywhere and in the space of locally integrable functions.)
 
 Whether a behavior is pathological is by definition subject to personal intuition. Pathologies depend on context, training, and experience—what is pathological to one researcher may very well be standard behaviour to another.
 
 Pathological examples can show the importance of the assumptions in a theorem.  For example, in [[statistics]], the [[Cauchy distribution]] does not satisfy the [[central limit theorem]], even though its symmetric bell-shape appears similar to many distributions which do; it fails the requirement to have a mean and standard deviation which exist and are finite.  
 
 Some of the best-known [[paradox]]es such as the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]] and [[Hausdorff paradox]] are based on the existence of [[non-measurable set]]s. Mathematicians, unless they take the minority position of denying the [[axiom of choice]], are in general resigned to living with such sets.
 
 ==Computer science==
 
 In [[computer science]], ''pathological'' has a slightly different sense with regard to the study of [[algorithm]]s. Here, an input (or set of inputs) is said to be ''pathological'' if it causes atypical behavior from the algorithm, such as a violation of its average case [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]], or even its correctness. For example, [[hash table]]s generally have pathological inputs: sets of keys that [[Hash collision|collide]] on hash values. [[Quicksort]] normally has [[Big O notation|O(n log n)]] time complexity, but deteriorates to O(n2) when given input that triggers suboptimal behaviour.
 
 The term is often used pejoratively, as a way of dismissing such inputs as being specially designed to break a routine that is otherwise sound in practice (compare with ''[[Byzantine failure|Byzantine]]''). On the other hand, awareness of pathological inputs is important as they can be exploited to mount a [[denial-of-service attack]] on a computer system.  Also, the term in this sense is a matter of subjective judgment as with its other senses.  Given enough run time, a sufficiently large and diverse user community, or other factors, an input which may be dismissed as pathological could in fact occur (as seen in the [[Ariane 5 Flight 501|first test flight]] of the [[Ariane 5]]).
 
 == Exceptions ==
 {{main|Exceptional object}}
 A similar but distinct phenomenon is that of [[exceptional object]]s (and [[exceptional isomorphism]]s), which occurs when there are a "small" number of exceptions to a general pattern – quantitatively, a finite set of exceptions to an otherwise infinite rule. By contrast, in cases of pathology, often most or almost all instances of a phenomenon are pathological, as discussed in [[#Prevalence|prevalence]], above – e.g., almost all real numbers are irrational.
 
 Subjectively, exceptional objects (such as the [[icosahedron]] or [[sporadic simple group]]s) are generally considered "beautiful", unexpected examples of a theory, while pathological phenomena are often considered "ugly", as the name implies. Accordingly, theories are usually expanded to include exceptional objects – for example, the [[exceptional Lie algebra]]s are included in the theory of [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s: the axioms are seen as good, the exceptional objects as unexpected but valid. By contrast, pathological examples are instead taken to point out a shortcoming in the axioms, requiring stronger axioms to rule them out – for example, requiring tameness of an embedding of a sphere in the [[Schönflies problem]]. One may study the more general theory, including the pathologies, which may provide its own simplifications (the real numbers have properties very different from the rationals, and likewise continuous maps have very different properties from smooth ones), but will also in general study the narrower theory from which the original examples were drawn.
