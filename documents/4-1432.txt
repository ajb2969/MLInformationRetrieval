   Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem      Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem   In mathematics , the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem , discovered by , is a result bounding the norms of non-linear operators acting on L p spaces .  Marcinkiewicz' theorem is similar to the Riesz–Thorin theorem about linear operators, but also applies to non-linear operators.  Preliminaries  Let f be a measurable function with real or complex values, defined on a measure space ( X , F , ω). The distribution function of f is defined by         λ  f    (  t  )    =   ω   {   x  ∈  X   ∣    |   f   (  x  )    |   >  t   }     .         subscript  λ  f   t     ω   conditional-set    x  X         f  x    t       \lambda_{f}(t)=\omega\left\{x\in X\mid|f(x)|>t\right\}.     Then f is called weak    L  1     superscript  L  1    L^{1}    if there exists a constant C such that the distribution of f satisfies the following inequality for all t > 0:         λ  f    (  t  )    ≤   C  t    .         subscript  λ  f   t     C  t     \lambda_{f}(t)\leq\frac{C}{t}.     The smallest constant C in the inequality above is called the weak    L  1     superscript  L  1    L^{1}   norm and is usually denoted by || f || 1, w or || f || 1,∞ . Similarly the space is usually denoted by L 1, w or L 1,∞ .  (Note: This terminology is a bit misleading since the weak norm does not satisfy the triangle inequality as one can see by considering the sum of the functions on    (  0  ,  1  )     0  1    (0,1)   given by    1  /  x      1  x    1/x   and    1  /   (   1  -  x   )       1    1  x     1/(1-x)   , which has norm 4 not 2.)  Any    L  1     superscript  L  1    L^{1}   function belongs to L 1, w and in addition one has the inequality         ∥  f  ∥    1  ,  w    ≤    ∥  f  ∥   1    .       subscript   norm  f    1  w     subscript   norm  f   1     \|f\|_{1,w}\leq\|f\|_{1}.     This is nothing but Markov's inequality (aka Chebyshev's Inequality). The converse is not true. For example, the function 1/ x belongs to L 1, w but not to L 1 .  Similarly, one may define the weak    L  p     superscript  L  p    L^{p}   space as the space of all functions f such that     |  f  |   p     superscript    f   p    |f|^{p}   belong to L 1, w , and the weak    L  p     superscript  L  p    L^{p}   norm using         ∥  f  ∥    p  ,  w    =    ∥    |  f  |   p   ∥    1  ,  w    1  /  p     .       subscript   norm  f    p  w     superscript   subscript   norm   superscript    f   p     1  w      1  p      \|f\|_{p,w}=\|\,|f|^{p}\|_{1,w}^{1/p}.     More directly, the L p , w norm is defined as the best constant C in the inequality        λ  f    (  t  )    ≤    C  p    t  p           subscript  λ  f   t      superscript  C  p    superscript  t  p      \lambda_{f}(t)\leq\frac{C^{p}}{t^{p}}     for all t > 0.  Formulation  Informally, Marcinkiewicz's theorem is  Theorem : Let T be a bounded linear operator from    L  p     superscript  L  p    L^{p}   to    L   p  ,  w      superscript  L   p  w     L^{p,w}   and at the same time from    L  q     superscript  L  q    L^{q}   to    L   q  ,  w      superscript  L   q  w     L^{q,w}   . Then T is also a bounded operator from    L  r     superscript  L  r    L^{r}   to    L  r     superscript  L  r    L^{r}   for any r between p and q.  In other words, even if you only require weak boundedness on the extremes p and q , you still get regular boundedness inside. To make this more formal, one has to explain that T is bounded only on a dense subset and can be completed. See Riesz-Thorin theorem for these details.  Where Marcinkiewicz's theorem is weaker than the Riesz-Thorin theorem is in the estimates of the norm. The theorem gives bounds for the    L  r     superscript  L  r    L^{r}   norm of T but this bound increases to infinity as r converges to either p or q . Specifically , suppose that         ∥   T  f   ∥    p  ,  w    ≤    N  p     ∥  f  ∥   p     ,       subscript   norm    T  f     p  w       subscript  N  p    subscript   norm  f   p      \|Tf\|_{p,w}\leq N_{p}\|f\|_{p},            ∥   T  f   ∥    q  ,  w    ≤    N  q     ∥  f  ∥   q     ,       subscript   norm    T  f     q  w       subscript  N  q    subscript   norm  f   q      \|Tf\|_{q,w}\leq N_{q}\|f\|_{q},   so that the operator norm of T from L p to L p , w is at most N p , and the operator norm of T from L q to L q , w is at most N q . Then the following interpolation inequality holds for all r between p and q and all f ∈ L r :        ∥   T  f   ∥   r   ≤   γ   N  p  δ    N  q   1  -  δ      ∥  f  ∥   r         subscript   norm    T  f    r     γ   superscript   subscript  N  p   δ    superscript   subscript  N  q     1  δ     subscript   norm  f   r      \|Tf\|_{r}\leq\gamma N_{p}^{\delta}N_{q}^{1-\delta}\|f\|_{r}   where      δ  =    p   (   q  -  r   )     r   (   q  -  p   )         δ      p    q  r      r    q  p       \delta=\frac{p(q-r)}{r(q-p)}   and       γ  =   2    (    r   (   q  -  p   )      (   r  -  p   )    (   q  -  r   )     )    1  /  r      .      γ    2   superscript      r    q  p        r  p     q  r       1  r       \gamma=2\left(\frac{r(q-p)}{(r-p)(q-r)}\right)^{1/r}.   The constants δ and γ can also be given for q = ∞ by passing to the limit.  A version of the theorem also holds more generally if T is only assumed to be a quasilinear operator. That is, there exists a constant C > 0 such that T satisfies       |   T   (   f  +  g   )    (  x  )    |   ≤   C   (    |   T  f   (  x  )    |   +   |   T  g   (  x  )    |    )            T    f  g   x      C        T  f  x        T  g  x        |T(f+g)(x)|\leq C(|Tf(x)|+|Tg(x)|)   for almost every  x . The theorem holds precisely as stated, except with γ replaced by       γ  =   2  C    (    r   (   q  -  p   )      (   r  -  p   )    (   q  -  r   )     )    1  /  r      .      γ    2  C   superscript      r    q  p        r  p     q  r       1  r       \gamma=2C\left(\frac{r(q-p)}{(r-p)(q-r)}\right)^{1/r}.     An operator T (possibly quasilinear) satisfying an estimate of the form        ∥   T  f   ∥    q  ,  w    ≤   C    ∥  f  ∥   p         subscript   norm    T  f     q  w      C   subscript   norm  f   p      \|Tf\|_{q,w}\leq C\|f\|_{p}   is said to be of weak type ( p , q ) . An operator is simply of type ( p , q ) if T is a bounded transformation from L p to L q :         ∥   T  f   ∥   q   ≤   C    ∥  f  ∥   p     .       subscript   norm    T  f    q     C   subscript   norm  f   p      \|Tf\|_{q}\leq C\|f\|_{p}.   A more general formulation of the interpolation theorem is as follows:   If T is a quasilinear operator of weak type ( p 0 , q 0 ) and of weak type ( p 1 , q 1 ) where q 0 ≠ q 1 , then for each θ ∈ (0,1), T is of type ( p , q ), for p and q with p ≤ q of the form          1  p   =     1  -  θ    p  0    +   θ   p  1      ,    1  q   =     1  -  θ    q  0    +   θ   q  1       .     formulae-sequence      1  p         1  θ    subscript  p  0      θ   subscript  p  1          1  q         1  θ    subscript  q  0      θ   subscript  q  1        \frac{1}{p}=\frac{1-\theta}{p_{0}}+\frac{\theta}{p_{1}},\quad\frac{1}{q}=\frac%
 {1-\theta}{q_{0}}+\frac{\theta}{q_{1}}.   The latter formulation follows from the former through an application of Hölder's inequality and a duality argument.  Applications and examples  A famous application example is the Hilbert transform . Viewed as a multiplier , the Hilbert transform of a function f can be computed by first taking the Fourier transform of f , then multiplying by the sign function , and finally applying the inverse Fourier transform .  Hence Parseval's theorem easily shows that the Hilbert transform is bounded from    L  2     superscript  L  2    L^{2}   to    L  2     superscript  L  2    L^{2}   . A much less obvious fact is that it is bounded from    L  1     superscript  L  1    L^{1}   to    L   1  ,  w      superscript  L   1  w     L^{1,w}   . Hence Marcinkiewicz's theorem shows that it is bounded from    L  p     superscript  L  p    L^{p}   to    L  p     superscript  L  p    L^{p}   for any 1 L^p to    L  p     superscript  L  p    L^{p}   bounds can be derived immediately from the    L  1     superscript  L  1    L^{1}   to weak    L  1     superscript  L  1    L^{1}   estimate by a clever change of variables, Marcinkiewicz interpolation is a more intuitive approach. Since the Hardy–Littlewood Maximal Function is trivially bounded from    L  ∞     superscript  L     L^{\infty}   to    L  ∞     superscript  L     L^{\infty}   , strong boundedness for all    p  >  1      p  1    p>1   follows immediately from the weak (1,1) estimate and interpolation. The weak (1,1) estimate can be obtained from the Vitali covering lemma .  History  The theorem was first announced by , who showed this result to Antoni Zygmund shortly before he died in World War II. The theorem was almost forgotten by Zygmund, and was absent from his original works on the theory of singular integral operators . Later  realized that Marcinkiewicz's result could greatly simplify his work, at which time he published his former student's theorem together with a generalization of his own.
