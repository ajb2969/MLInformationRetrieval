   Andrica's conjecture      Andrica's conjecture   Andrica's conjecture (named after Dorin Andrica ) is a conjecture regarding the gaps between prime numbers . 1  The conjecture states that the inequality         p   n  +  1     -    p  n     <  1           subscript  p    n  1        subscript  p  n     1    \sqrt{p_{n+1}}-\sqrt{p_{n}}<1   holds for all   n   n   n   , where    p  n     subscript  p  n    p_{n}   is the n th prime number. If     g  n   =    p   n  +  1    -   p  n         subscript  g  n      subscript  p    n  1     subscript  p  n      g_{n}=p_{n+1}-p_{n}   denotes the nth prime gap , then Andrica's conjecture can also be rewritten as       g  n   <    2    p  n     +  1.        subscript  g  n       2     subscript  p  n     1.     g_{n}<2\sqrt{p_{n}}+1.     Empirical evidence  Imran Ghory has used data on the largest prime gaps to confirm the conjecture for   n   n   n   up to 1.3002 x 10 16 . 2 Using a table of maximal gaps and the above gap inequality, the confirmation value can be extended exhaustively to 4 x 10 18 .  The discrete function     A  n   =     p   n  +  1     -    p  n          subscript  A  n        subscript  p    n  1        subscript  p  n       A_{n}=\sqrt{p_{n+1}}-\sqrt{p_{n}}   is plotted in the figures opposite. The high-water marks for    A  n     subscript  A  n    A_{n}   occur for n = 1, 2, and 4, with A 4 ≈ 0.670873..., with no larger value among the first 10 5 primes. Since the Andrica function decreases asymptotically as n increases, a prime gap of ever increasing size is needed to make the difference large as n becomes large. It therefore seems highly likely the conjecture is true, although this has not yet been proven.  Generalizations  As a generalization of Andrica's conjecture, the following equation has been considered:         p   n  +  1   x   -   p  n  x    =  1   ,         superscript   subscript  p    n  1    x    superscript   subscript  p  n   x    1    p_{n+1}^{x}-p_{n}^{x}=1,   where    p  n     subscript  p  n    p_{n}   is the n th prime and x can be any positive number.  The largest possible solution x is easily seen to occur for    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   , when x max =1. The smallest solution x is conjectured to be x min ≈ 0.567148...  which occurs for n = 30.  This conjecture has also been stated as an inequality , the generalized Andrica conjecture:        p   n  +  1   x   -   p  n  x    <  1         superscript   subscript  p    n  1    x    superscript   subscript  p  n   x    1    p_{n+1}^{x}-p_{n}^{x}<1   for     x  <   x  min    .      x   subscript  x      x     See also   Cramér's conjecture  Legendre's conjecture  Firoozbakht's conjecture   References and notes     External links   Andrica's Conjecture at PlanetMath  [ http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&from; ;=objects&id;=9636 Generalized Andrica conjecture ] at PlanetMath    "  Category:Conjectures about prime numbers     ↩  Prime Numbers: The Most Mysterious Figures in Math , John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2005, p.13. ↩
