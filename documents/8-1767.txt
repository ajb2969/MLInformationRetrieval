Andrica's conjecture

Andrica's conjecture (named after Dorin Andrica) is a conjecture regarding the gaps between prime numbers.1
The conjecture states that the inequality


 
  holds for all 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the nth prime number. If 
 
 
 
 
  denotes the nth prime gap, then Andrica's conjecture can also be rewritten as



Empirical evidence
Imran Ghory has used data on the largest prime gaps to confirm the conjecture for 
 
 
 
  up to 1.3002 x 1016.2 Using a table of maximal gaps and the above gap inequality, the confirmation value can be extended exhaustively to 4 x 1018.
The discrete function 
 
 
 
  is plotted in the figures opposite. The high-water marks for 
 
 
 
  occur for n = 1, 2, and 4, with A4 ≈ 0.670873..., with no larger value among the first 105 primes. Since the Andrica function decreases asymptotically as n increases, a prime gap of ever increasing size is needed to make the difference large as n becomes large. It therefore seems highly likely the conjecture is true, although this has not yet been proven.
Generalizations
As a generalization of Andrica's conjecture, the following equation has been considered:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the nth prime and x can be any positive number.
The largest possible solution x is easily seen to occur for 
 
 
 
 , when xmax=1. The smallest solution x is conjectured to be xmin ≈ 0.567148...  which occurs for n = 30.
This conjecture has also been stated as an inequality, the generalized Andrica conjecture:
