   Bloch's formula      Bloch's formula   In algebraic K-theory , a branch of mathematics , Bloch's formula , introduced by Spencer Bloch for    K  2     subscript  K  2    K_{2}   , states that the Chow group of a smooth variety X over a field is isomorphic to the cohomology of X with coefficients in the K-theory of the structure sheaf    𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   ; that is,          CH  q    (  X  )    =    H  q    (  X  ,    K  q    (   𝒪  X   )    )          superscript  CH  q   X     superscript  normal-H  q   X     subscript  K  q    subscript  𝒪  X       \operatorname{CH}^{q}(X)=\operatorname{H}^{q}(X,K_{q}(\mathcal{O}_{X}))        where the right-hand side is the sheaf cohomology;     K  q    (   𝒪  X   )        subscript  K  q    subscript  𝒪  X     K_{q}(\mathcal{O}_{X})   is the sheaf associated to the presheaf    U  ↦    K  q    (  U  )       maps-to  U     subscript  K  q   U     U\mapsto K_{q}(U)   , U Zariski open subsets of X . The general case is due to Quillen. 1 For q = 1, one recovers     Pic   (  X  )    =    H  1    (  X  ,   𝒪  X  *   )         Pic  X      superscript  H  1    X   superscript   subscript  𝒪  X         \operatorname{Pic}(X)=H^{1}(X,\mathcal{O}_{X}^{*})   . (see also Picard group .)  The formula for the mixed characteristic is still open.  References   Daniel Quillen : Higher algebraic K-theory: I. In: H. Bass (ed.): Higher K-Theories.
