Bloch's formula

In algebraic K-theory, a branch of mathematics, Bloch's formula, introduced by Spencer Bloch for 
 
 
 
 , states that the Chow group of a smooth variety X over a field is isomorphic to the cohomology of X with coefficients in the K-theory of the structure sheaf 
 
 
 
 ; that is,








where the right-hand side is the sheaf cohomology; 
 
 
 
 
  is the sheaf associated to the presheaf 
 
 
 
 , U Zariski open subsets of X. The general case is due to Quillen.1 For q = 1, one recovers 
 
 
 
 . (see also Picard group.)
The formula for the mixed characteristic is still open.
