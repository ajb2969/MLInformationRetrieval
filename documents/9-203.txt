Jack function

In mathematics, the Jack function, introduced by Henry Jack, is a homogeneous, symmetric polynomial which generalizes the Schur and zonal polynomials, and is in turn generalized by the Heckman–Opdam polynomials and Macdonald polynomials.
Definition
The Jack function 
 
 
 
  of integer partition

 
 , parameter 
 
 
 
  and arguments 
 
 
 
  can be recursively defined as follows:

For m=1 :





For m>1:




where the summation is over all partitions 
 
 
 
  such that the skew partition

 
  is a horizontal strip, namely


 
  (
 
 
 
  must be zero or otherwise 
 
 
 
 ) and



where 
 
 
 
  equals 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  otherwise. The expressions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  refer to the conjugate partitions of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively. The notation 
 
 
 
  means that the product is taken over all coordinates 
 
 
 
  of boxes in the Young diagram of the partition 
 
 
 
 .
Combinatorial formula
In 1997, F. Knop and S. Sahi  gave a purely combinatorial formula for the Jack polynomials 
 
 
 
  in n variables:


 
 . The sum is taken over all admissible tableaux of shape 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
An admissible tableau of shape 
 
 
 
  is a filling of the Young diagram 
 
 
 
  with numbers 1,2,…,n such that for any box (i,j) in the tableau,

T(i,j) ≠ T('' i',j'') whenever i' > i.
T(i,j) ≠ T('' i',j''-1) whenever j>1 and i' < i.

A box 
 
 
 
  is critical for the tableau T if j>1 and 
 
 
 
 .
This result can be seen as a special case of the more general combinatorial formula for Macdonald polynomials.
C normalization
The Jack functions form an orthogonal basis in a space of symmetric polynomials, with inner product: 
 
 
 
  where



For 
 
 
 
  denoted often as just 
 
 
 
  is known as the Zonal polynomial.
P normalization
The P normalization is given by the identity 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denotes the arm and leg length respectively. Therefore, for 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the usual Schur function.
Similar to Schur polynomials, 
 
 
 
  can be expressed as a sum over Young tableaux. However, one need to add an extra weight to each tableau that depends on the parameter 
 
 
 
 .
Thus, a formula  for the Jack function 
 
 
 
  is given by



where the sum is taken over all tableaux of shape 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  denotes the entry in box s of T.
The weight 
 
 
 
  can be defined in the following fashion: Each tableau T of shape 
 
 
 
  can be interpreted as a sequence of partitions 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  defines the skew shape with content i in T. Then 
 
 
 
  where


 
  and the product is taken only over all boxes s in 
 
 
 
 
  such that s has a box from 
 
 
 
  in the same row, but not in the same column.
Connection with the Schur polynomial
When 
 
 
 
  the Jack function is a scalar multiple of the Schur polynomial


 
  where


 
  is the product of all hook lengths of 
 
 
 
 .
Properties
If the partition has more parts than the number of variables, then the Jack function is 0:



Matrix argument
In some texts, especially in random matrix theory, authors have found it more convenient to use a matrix argument in the Jack function. The connection is simple. If 
 
 
 
  is a matrix with eigenvalues 
 
 
 
 , then
$$J_\kappa^{(\alpha )}(X)=J_\kappa^{(\alpha )}(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_m).$$
