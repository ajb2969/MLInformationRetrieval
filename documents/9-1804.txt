   Equilibrium fractionation      Equilibrium fractionation  Equilibrium [[isotope fractionation]] is the partial separation of [[isotopes]] between two or more substances in [[chemical equilibrium]]. '''Equilibrium fractionation''' is strongest at low temperatures, and (along with [[kinetic isotope effect ]]s) forms the basis of the most widely used isotopic paleothermometers (or climate proxies ): D/H and 18 O/ 16 O records from ice cores , and 18 O/ 16 O records from calcium carbonate. It is thus important for the construction of geologic temperature records . 1 Isotopic fractionations attributed to equilibrium processes have been observed in many elements, from hydrogen ( D/H ) to uranium ( 238 U/ 235 U ). In general, the light elements (especially hydrogen , boron , carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and sulfur ) are most susceptible to fractionation, and their isotopes tend to be separated to a greater degree than heavier elements.  Definition  Most equilibrium fractionations are thought to result from the reduction in vibrational energy (especially zero-point energy ) when a more massive isotope is substituted for a less massive one. This leads to higher concentrations of the massive isotopes in substances where the vibrational energy is most sensitive to isotope substitution, i.e., those with the highest bond force constants.  In a reaction involving the exchange of two isotopes, l X and h X, of element "X" in molecules AX and BX,         A  l   X   +    B  h   X    ⇌     A  h   X   +    B  l   X       normal-⇌       superscript  A  l   X      superscript  B  h   X         superscript  A  h   X      superscript  B  l   X      A^{l}X+B^{h}X\rightleftharpoons A^{h}X+B^{l}X     each reactant molecule is identical to a product except for the distribution of isotopes (i.e., they are isotopologues ). The amount of isotopic fractionation in an exchange reaction can be expressed as a fractionation factor:      α  =      (  h   X    /  l    X  )    A  X       (  h   X    /  l    X  )    B  X         α     subscript   fragments   superscript  normal-(  h   X   superscript   l   X  normal-)     A  X     subscript   fragments   superscript  normal-(  h   X   superscript   l   X  normal-)     B  X       \alpha=\frac{(^{h}X/^{l}X)_{AX}}{(^{h}X/^{l}X)_{BX}}       α  =  1      α  1    \alpha=1   indicates that the isotopes are distributed evenly between AX and BX, with no isotopic fractionation.    α  >  1      α  1    \alpha>1   indicates that h X is concentrated in substance AX, and    α  <  1      α  1    \alpha<1   indicates h X is concentrated in substance BX.   α   α   \alpha   is closely related to the equilibrium constant (K eq ):      α  =    (       K   e  q    ⋅  Π    σ   P  r  o  d  u  c  t  s     /  Π    σ   R  e  a  c  t  a  n  t  s     )    1  /  n        α   superscript         normal-⋅   subscript  K    e  q    normal-Π    subscript  σ    P  r  o  d  u  c  t  s     normal-Π    subscript  σ    R  e  a  c  t  a  n  t  s       1  n      \alpha=(K_{eq}\cdot\Pi\sigma_{Products}/\Pi\sigma_{Reactants})^{1/n}     where    Π   σ   P  r  o  d  u  c  t  s        normal-Π   subscript  σ    P  r  o  d  u  c  t  s      \Pi\sigma_{Products}   is the product of the rotational symmetry numbers of the products (right side of the exchange reaction),    Π   σ   R  e  a  c  t  a  n  t  s        normal-Π   subscript  σ    R  e  a  c  t  a  n  t  s      \Pi\sigma_{Reactants}   is the product of the rotational symmetry numbers of the reactants (left side of the exchange reaction), and   n   n   n   is the number of atoms exchanged.  An example of equilibrium isotope fractionation is the concentration of heavy isotopes of oxygen in liquid water , relative to water vapor ,         H  2  16    O   (  l  )     +    H  2  18    O   (  g  )      ⇌     H  2  18    O   (  l  )     +    H  2  16    O   (  g  )         normal-⇌       superscript   subscript  H  2   16    subscript  O  l       superscript   subscript  H  2   18    subscript  O  g          superscript   subscript  H  2   18    subscript  O  l       superscript   subscript  H  2   16    subscript  O  g       H_{2}^{16}O_{(l)}+H_{2}^{18}O_{(g)}\rightleftharpoons H_{2}^{18}O_{(l)}+H_{2}^%
 {16}O_{(g)}     At 20 °C, the equilibrium fractionation factor for this reaction is      α  =      (  18   O    /  16    O  )    L  i  q  u  i  d       (  18   O    /  16    O  )    V  a  p  o  r     =  1.0098        α     subscript   fragments   superscript  normal-(  18   O   superscript   16   O  normal-)     L  i  q  u  i  d     subscript   fragments   superscript  normal-(  18   O   superscript   16   O  normal-)     V  a  p  o  r          1.0098     \alpha=\frac{(^{18}O/^{16}O)_{Liquid}}{(^{18}O/^{16}O)_{Vapor}}=1.0098     Equilibrium fractionation is a type of mass-dependent isotope fractionation, while mass-independent fractionation is usually assumed to be a non-equilibrium process.  For non-equilibrium reactions, isotopic effects are better described by the GEBIK and GEBIF equations for transient kinetic isotope fractionation , which generalize non-steady isotopic effects in any chemical and biochemical reactions. 2  Example  When water vapor condenses (an equilibrium fractionation ), the heavier water isotopes ( and 2 H) become enriched in the liquid phase while the lighter isotopes ( and 1 ) tend toward the vapor phase. 3  Other types of fractionation   Kinetic fractionation  Mass-independent fractionation  Transient kinetic isotope fractionation   See also   Isotope analysis  Isotope electrochemistry  Isotope geochemistry  Kinetic isotope effect  Stable isotope  Standard electrode potential   References    Chacko T., Cole D.R., and Horita J.
