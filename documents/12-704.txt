   Shewanella algae      Shewanella algae   Shewanella algae is a rod-shaped Gram-negative  marine  bacterium . S. algae is also a facultative anaerobe with the ability to reduce  iron , uranium and plutonium  metabolically . When no oxygen is available, it can use metal cations as the terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain .  S. algae is of great interest to the United States Department of Energy because of its ability to reduce the amount of radioactive  waste in groundwater by making it less soluble . An example would be:            C  6    H  12    O  6    +   12   U   6  +     +   6   H  2   O   +   24   e  -     ⟶        6  C   O  2    +   12   U   4  +     +   24   H  +            W   a  t  e   r   S  o  l  u  b  l  e      W  a  t  e   r   I  n  s  o  l  u  b  l  e           normal-⟶       subscript  C  6    subscript  H  12    subscript  O  6      12   superscript  U   limit-from  6        6   subscript  H  2   O     24   superscript  e      absent       6  C   subscript  O  2      12   superscript  U   limit-from  4        24   superscript  H       missing-subexpression       W  a  t  e  r  S  o  l  u  b  l  e     W  a  t  e  r  I  n  s  o  l  u  b  l  e    missing-subexpression      \begin{array}[]{lcr}C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}+12U^{6+}+6H_{2}O+24e^{-}\longrightarrow&6%
