   P-form electrodynamics      P-form electrodynamics   In theoretical physics , p-form electrodynamics is a generalization of Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism .  Ordinary (viz. one-form) Abelian electrodynamics  We have a one-form A , a gauge symmetry      𝐀  →   𝐀  +   d  α       normal-→  𝐀    𝐀    d  α      \mathbf{A}\rightarrow\mathbf{A}+d\alpha     where α is any arbitrary fixed 0-form and d is the exterior derivative , and a gauge-invariant vector current  J with density 1 satisfying the continuity equation       d  *  𝐉   =  0        d  𝐉   0    d*\mathbf{J}=0     where * is the Hodge dual .  Alternatively, we may express J as a ( d − 1)- closed form , but we do not consider that case here.  F is a gauge invariant  2-form defined as the exterior derivative    𝐅  =   d  𝐀       𝐅    d  𝐀     \mathbf{F}=d\mathbf{A}   .  A satisfies the equation of motion      d  *  𝐅  =  *  𝐉     fragments  d   F    J    d*\mathbf{F}=*\mathbf{J}     (this equation obviously implies the continuity equation).  This can be derived from the action      S  =   ∫  M    [   1  2   𝐅  ∧  *  𝐅  -  𝐀  ∧  *  𝐉  ]      fragments  S    subscript   M    fragments  normal-[    1  2   F    F   A    J  normal-]     S=\int_{M}\left[\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{F}\wedge*\mathbf{F}-\mathbf{A}\wedge*%
 \mathbf{J}\right]     where M is the spacetime  manifold .  p-form Abelian electrodynamics  We have a p-form  B , a gauge symmetry      𝐁  →   𝐁  +   d  α       normal-→  𝐁    𝐁    d  α      \mathbf{B}\rightarrow\mathbf{B}+d\mathbf{\alpha}     where α is any arbitrary fixed (p-1)-form and d is the exterior derivative ,  and a gauge-invariant p-vector  J with density 1 satisfying the continuity equation       d  *  𝐉   =  0        d  𝐉   0    d*\mathbf{J}=0     where * is the Hodge dual .  Alternatively, we may express J as a (d-p)- closed form .  C is a gauge invariant (p+1)-form defined as the exterior derivative    𝐂  =   d  𝐁       𝐂    d  𝐁     \mathbf{C}=d\mathbf{B}   .  B satisfies the equation of motion      d  *  𝐂  =  *  𝐉     fragments  d   C    J    d*\mathbf{C}=*\mathbf{J}     (this equation obviously implies the continuity equation).  This can be derived from the action      S  =   ∫  M    [   1  2   𝐂  ∧  *  𝐂  +    (  -  1  )   p   𝐁  ∧  *  𝐉  ]      fragments  S    subscript   M    fragments  normal-[    1  2   C    C    superscript   fragments  normal-(   1  normal-)   p   B    J  normal-]     S=\int_{M}\left[\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{C}\wedge*\mathbf{C}+(-1)^{p}\mathbf{B}%
 \wedge*\mathbf{J}\right]     where M is the spacetime  manifold .  Other sign conventions do exist.  The Kalb-Ramond field is an example with p=2 in string theory; the Ramond-Ramond fields whose charged sources are D-branes are examples for all values of p . In 11d supergravity or M-theory , we have a 3-form electrodynamics.  Non-abelian generalization  Just as we have non-abelian generalizations of electrodynamics, leading to Yang–Mills theories , we also have nonabelian generalizations of p-form electrodynamics. They typically require the use of gerbes .
