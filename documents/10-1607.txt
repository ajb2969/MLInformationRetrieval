   Acetoin racemase      Acetoin racemase   In enzymology , an acetoin racemase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-acetoin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (R)-acetoin   This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on hydroxy acids and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetoin racemase . This enzyme is also called acetylmethylcarbinol racemase . This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism .
