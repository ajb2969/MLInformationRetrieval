Amidinoaspartase

In enzymology, an amidinoaspartase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-amidino-L-aspartate + H2O 
 
 
 
  L-aspartate + urea
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-amidino-L-aspartate and H2O, whereas its two products are L-aspartate and urea.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-amidino-L-aspartate amidinohydrolase. This enzyme is also called amidinoaspartic amidinohydrolase.
