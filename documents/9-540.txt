   Directed infinity      Directed infinity   A directed infinity is a type of infinity in the complex plane that has a defined angle θ but an infinite absolute value r . 1 For example, the limit of 1/ x where x is a positive number approaching zero is a directed infinity with angle 0; however, 1/0 is not a directed infinity, but a complex infinity . Some rules for manipulation of directed infinities are:         w  ∞   +   z  ∞    =    (   w  +  z   )   ∞           w      z         w  z       w\infty+z\infty=(w+z)\infty           z  ∞   =    z   |  z  |    ∞    .        z        z    z        z\infty=\frac{z}{\left|z\right|}\infty.         0  ∞  is undefined, as is    z  ∞    w  ∞        0   is undefined, as is      z      w       0\infty\text{ is undefined, as is }\frac{z\infty}{w\infty}          a  z  ∞   =   {      z  ∞        if  a   >  0   ,        -   z  ∞        if  a   <  0.             a  z     cases    z        if  a   0       z         if  a   0.      az\infty=\begin{cases}z\infty&\text{if }a>0,\\
