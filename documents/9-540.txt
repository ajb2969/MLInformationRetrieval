Directed infinity

A directed infinity is a type of infinity in the complex plane that has a defined angle θ but an infinite absolute value r.1 For example, the limit of 1/x where x is a positive number approaching zero is a directed infinity with angle 0; however, 1/0 is not a directed infinity, but a complex infinity. Some rules for manipulation of directed infinities are:
