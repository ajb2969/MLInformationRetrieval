Kharitonov region

A Kharitonov region is a concept in mathematics. It arises in the study of the stability of polynomials.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a simply-connected set in the complex plane and let 
 
 
 
  be the polynomial family.


 
  is said to be a Kharitonov region if



is a subset of 
 
 
 
  Here, 
 
 
 
  denotes the set of all vertex polynomials of complex interval polynomials 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denotes the set of all vertex polynomials of real interval polynomials
