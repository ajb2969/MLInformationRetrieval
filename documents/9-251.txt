   Kharitonov region      Kharitonov region   A Kharitonov region is a concept in mathematics . It arises in the study of the stability of polynomials .  Let   D   D   D   be a simply-connected set in the complex plane and let   P   P   P   be the polynomial family.     D   D   D   is said to be a Kharitonov region if       V  T  n    (   V  S  n   )        superscript   subscript  V  T   n    superscript   subscript  V  S   n     V_{T}^{n}(V_{S}^{n})     is a subset of    P  .    P   P.   Here,    V  T  n     superscript   subscript  V  T   n    V_{T}^{n}   denotes the set of all vertex polynomials of complex interval polynomials    (   T  n   )     superscript  T  n    (T^{n})   and    V  S  n     superscript   subscript  V  S   n    V_{S}^{n}   denotes the set of all vertex polynomials of real interval polynomials     (   S  n   )   .     superscript  S  n    (S^{n}).
