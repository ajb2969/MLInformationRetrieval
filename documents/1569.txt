   Phosphoglucan, water dikinase      Phosphoglucan, water dikinase   In enzymology , a phosphoglucan, water dikinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + [phospho-alpha-glucan] + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + O-phospho-[phospho-alpha-glucan] + phosphate   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , phospho-alpha-glucan , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are AMP , O-phospho-[phospho-alpha-glucan ], and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , to be specific, those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with paired acceptors ( dikinases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:phospho-alpha-glucan, water phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include PWD , and OK1 .
