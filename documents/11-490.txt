Glycerol-1-phosphatase




Glycerol-1-phosphatase

In enzymology, a glycerol-1-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

glycerol 1-phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  glycerol + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glycerol 1-phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are glycerol and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycerol-1-phosphate phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include alpha-glycerophosphatase, alpha-glycerol phosphatase, glycerol 3-phosphatase, glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatase, and glycerol 3-phosphate phosphohydrolase. This enzyme participates in glycerolipid metabolism.
