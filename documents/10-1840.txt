   Galactosylceramide sulfotransferase      Galactosylceramide sulfotransferase   In enzymology , a galactosylceramide sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + a galactosylceramide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + a galactosylceramidesulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and galactosylceramide , whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and galactosylceramidesulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:galactosylceramide 3'-sulfotransferase . Other names in common use include GSase , 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate-cerebroside sulfotransferase , galactocerebroside sulfotransferase , galactolipid sulfotransferase , glycolipid sulfotransferase , and glycosphingolipid sulfotransferase . This enzyme participates in sphingolipid metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 2.8.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
