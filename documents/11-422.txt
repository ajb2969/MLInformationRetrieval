5-phytase

In enzymology, a 5-phytase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

myo-inositol hexakisphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  1L-myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,6-pentakisphosphate + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are myo-inositol hexakisphosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are 1L-myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,6-pentakisphosphate and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is myo-inositol-hexakisphosphate 5-phosphohydrolase.
Prevalence
Of the hundreds of phytase enzymes that have been characterized in the literature, only two have been characterized as 5-phytases.1 A histidine acid phosphatases purified from lily pollen2 and a protein tyrosine phosphatase-like phytase from Selenomonas ruminantium subsp. lactilytica3 were both found to have specificity for the 5-phosphate position of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only the phytase purified from lily pollen had its structure solved, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
