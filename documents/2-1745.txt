Antilinear map




Antilinear map

In mathematics, a mapping

 
  from a complex vector space to another is said to be antilinear (or conjugate-linear or semilinear, though the latter term is more general) if



for all 
 
 
 
  and all 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the complex conjugates of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively. The composition of two antilinear maps is complex-linear.
An antilinear map 
 
 
 
  may be equivalently described in terms of the linear map

 
  from 
 
 
 
  to the complex conjugate vector space

 
 .
Antilinear maps occur in quantum mechanics in the study of time reversal and in spinor calculus, where it is customary to replace the bars over the basis vectors and the components of geometric objects by dots put above the indices.
