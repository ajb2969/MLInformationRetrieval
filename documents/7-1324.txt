 \sin(\omega/2)}   (the modulation factor vanishes if windows are time-shifted around 0)  Name  Hann function is the original name, in honour of von Hann; however, the erroneous "Hanning" function is also heard of on occasion, derived from the paper in which it was named, where the term "hanning a signal" was used to mean applying the Hann window to it. The confusion arose from the similar Hamming function , named after Richard Hamming .  Use  The Hann function is typically used as a window function in digital signal processing to select a subset of a series of samples in order to perform a Fourier transform or other calculations.  i.e. (using continuous version to illustrate)       S   (  œÑ  )    =   ‚à´   w   (   t  +  œÑ   )   f   (  t  )   d  t          S  œÑ       w    t  œÑ   f  t  d  t      S(\tau)=\int w(t+\tau)f(t)\,dt     Such windows are also widely called "Hanning windows" and "Hann'd".  The advantage of the Hann window is very low aliasing , and the tradeoff is slightly decreased resolution (widening of the main lobe). If the Hann window is used to sample a signal in order to convert to frequency domain, it is complex to reconvert to the time domain without adding distortions.
