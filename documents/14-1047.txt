Mott–Bethe formula

The Mott–Bethe formula is used to calculate electron form factors from X-ray form factors.1 The equation uses the first Born approximation.



where 
 
 
 
  is the electron scattering cross-section and 
 
 
 
  is the x-ray scattering cross section. This is a function of 
 
 
 
 
 , the scattering vector in reciprocal space (in units of inverse distance), and Z is the atomic number of the atom. In the equation 
 
 
 
  is Planck's constant, 
 
 
 
  is the vacuum permittivity.
The units of the scattering factor are
