   Mott–Bethe formula      Mott–Bethe formula   The Mott–Bethe formula is used to calculate electron  form factors from X-ray form factors. 1 The equation uses the first Born approximation .        f  B    (  q  ,  Z  )    =     m   e  2     2  π   ℏ  2    ϵ  0      (    Z  -    f  x    (  q  ,  Z  )      q  2    )           superscript  f  B    q  Z          m   superscript  e  2      2  π   superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2    subscript  ϵ  0         Z     subscript  f  x    q  Z      superscript  q  2       f^{B}(q,Z)=\frac{me^{2}}{2\pi\hbar^{2}\epsilon_{0}}\Bigg(\frac{Z-f_{x}(q,Z)}{q%

This is a function of   q   q   q   , the scattering vector in reciprocal space (in units of inverse distance), and Z is the atomic number of the atom. In the equation   ℏ   Planck-constant-over-2-pi   \hbar   is Planck's constant ,    ϵ  0     subscript  ϵ  0    \epsilon_{0}   is the vacuum permittivity .
