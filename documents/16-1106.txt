Principalization (algebra)

In the mathematical field of algebraic number theory, the concept principalization has its origin in David Hilbert's 1897 conjecture that all ideals of an algebraic number field, which can always be generated by two algebraic numbers, become principal ideals, generated by a single algebraic number, when they are transferred to the maximal abelian unramified extension field, which was later called the Hilbert class field, of the given base field. More than thirty years later, Philipp Furtw√§ngler succeeded in proving this principal ideal theorem in 1930, after it had been translated from number theory to group theory by E. Artin in 1929, who made use of his general reciprocity law to establish the reformulation. Since this long desired proof was achieved by means of Artin transfers of non-abelian groups with derived length two, several investigators tried to exploit the theory of such groups further to obtain additional information on the principalization in intermediate fields between the base field and its Hilbert class field. The first contributions in this direction are due to A. Scholz and O. Taussky in 1934, who coined the synonym capitulation for principalization. Another independent access to the principalization problem via Galois cohomology of unit groups is also due to Hilbert and goes back to the chapter on cyclic relative extensions of prime degree in his number report 1897, which culminates in the famous Theorem 94.
Extension of classes
Let 
 
 
 
  be an algebraic number field, called the base field, and let 
 
 
 
  be a field extension of finite degree. The embedding monomorphism of fractional ideals

 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the ring of integers of 
 
 
 
 , induces the extension homomorphism of ideal class groups

 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denote the subgroups of principal ideals.
If there exists a non-principal ideal 
 
 
 
 , with non trivial class 
 
 
 
 , whose extension ideal in 
 
 
 
  is principal, 
 
 
 
 for some number 
 
 
 
 , and hence belongs to the trivial class 
 
 
 
 , then we speak about principalization or capitulation in 
 
 
 
 . In this case, the ideal 
 
 
 
  and its class 
 
 
 
  are said to principalize or capitulate in 
 
 
 
 . This phenomenon is described most conveniently by the principalization kernel or capitulation kernel, that is the kernel 
 
 
 
  of the class extension homomorphism.
More generaly, let 
 
 
 
  be a modulus in 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is nonzero ideal in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a formal product of pair-wise different real infinite primes of 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is the ray modulo 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the group of nonzero fractional ideals in 
 
 
 
  relatively prime to 
 
 
 
  and the condition 
 
 
 
  means 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for every infinite real place 
 
 
 
  dividing 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
 , then the group 
 
 
 
  is called generalized ideal class group for 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are generalized ideal class groups such that 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  induces the extension homomorphism of generalized ideal class groups 
 
 
 
 .
Galois extensions of number fields
Let 
 
 
 
  be a Galois extension of algebraic number fields with Galois group

 
 . Suppose that 
 
 
 
  is a prime ideal of 
 
 
 
  which does not divide the relative discriminant

 
 , and is therefore unramified in 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be a prime ideal of 
 
 
 
  lying over 
 
 
 
 .
Frobenius automorphism
There exists a unique automorphism 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , for all algebraic integers 
 
 
 
 , which is called the Frobenius automorphism

 
  of 
 
 
 
 . It generates the decomposition group

 
  of 
 
 
 
  and its order is equal to the inertia degree

 
  of 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
 . (If 
 
 
 
  is ramified then 
 
 
 
  is only defined and generates 
 
 
 
  modulo the inertia subgroup

 
  whose order is the ramification index

 
  of 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
 ). Any other prime ideal of 
 
 
 
  dividing 
 
 
 
  is of the form 
 
 
 
  with some 
 
 
 
 . Its Frobenius automorphism is given by 
 
 
 
 , since 
 
 
 
 , for all 
 
 
 
 , and thus its decomposition group 
 
 
 
  is conjugate to 
 
 
 
 . In this general situation, the Artin symbol is a mapping 
 
 
 
  which associates an entire conjugacy class of automorphisms to any unramified prime ideal 
 
 
 
 , and we have 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
splits completely in 
 
 
 
 .
Factorization of prime ideals
When 
 
 
 
  is an intermediate field with relative group 
 
 
 
 , more precise statements about the homomorphisms 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are possible because we can construct factorization of 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
  is unramified in 
 
 
 
  as above) in 
 
 
 
  from its factorization in 
 
 
 
  as follows.12 Prime ideals in 
 
 
 
  lying over 
 
 
 
  are in 

 
 -equivariant bijection with the 

 
 -set of left cosets 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  corresponds to coset 
 
 
 
 . For every prime ideal 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  lying over 
 
 
 
  the Galois group 
 
 
 
  acts transitively on the set of prime ideals in 
 
 
 
  lying over 
 
 
 
 , thus such ideals 
 
 
 
  are in bijection with orbits of action of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  by left multiplication. Such orbits are in turn in bijection with double cosets

 
 . Hence 
 
 
 
  factorizes in 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  are the prime ideals lying over 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  satisfying 
 
 
 
 . The product runs over a double coset decomposition 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  modulo 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with a complete system of representatives 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  denotes the orbit of coset 
 
 
 
  in the action of 
 
 
 
  on set of left cosets 
 
 
 
  by left multiplication and 
 
 
 
  denotes the orbit of coset 
 
 
 
  in the action of 
 
 
 
  on the set of right cosets 
 
 
 
  by right multiplication. Then clearly 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the decomposition group of 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
 . Then on the one hand it's 
 
 
 
 , on the other hand the stabilizer of 
 
 
 
  is given by


 
  so by the orbit-stabilizer theorem we have 
 
 
 
 . Altogether we get


 
  In other words, the inertia degree 
 
 
 
  is equal to the size of the orbit of coset 
 
 
 
  in the action of 
 
 
 
 
  on the set of right cosets 
 
 
 
  by right multiplication. By taking inverses, this is equal to the size of the orbit 
 
 
 
  of coset 
 
 
 
  in the action of 
 
 
 
  on the set of left cosets 
 
 
 
 
  by left multiplication. Also the prime ideals in 
 
 
 
  lying over 
 
 
 
  correspond to the orbits of this action.
Consequently, the ideal embedding is given by 
 
 
 
 , and the class extension by 
 
 
 
 .
Artin's reciprocity law
Now further assume 
 
 
 
 
  is an abelian extension, that is, 
 
 
 
  is an abelian group. Then, all conjugate decomposition groups of prime ideals of 
 
 
 
  lying over 
 
 
 
  coincide 
 
 
 
 , for any 
 
 
 
 
 , and the Artin symbol 
 
 
 
  becomes equal to the Frobenius automorphism of any 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
By class field theory,3 the abelian extension 
 
 
 
 
  uniquely corresponds to an intermediate group 
 
 
 
  between the ray modulo 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , that is 
 
 
 
 , and the group of principal ideals coprime to 
 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the relative conductor. (Note that 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 , but 
 
 
 
 
  is minimal with this property.) The Artin symbol 
 
 
 
 , which associates the Frobenius automorphism of 
 
 
 
  to each prime ideal 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  which is unramified in 
 
 
 
 
 , can be extended by multiplicativity to an epimorphism 
 
 
 
  with kernel 
 
 
 
 , which induces the Artin isomorphism, or Artin map, 
 
 
 
  of the generalized ideal class group 
 
 
 
  to the Galois group 
 
 
 
 
 , which maps the class 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  to the Artin symbol 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 . This explicit isomorphism is called the Artin reciprocity law or general reciprocity law.4

Group-theoretic formulation of the problem
This reciprocity law allowed Artin to translate the general principalization problem for number fields 
 
 
 
 
  based on the following scenario from number theory to group theory. Let 
 
 
 
  be a Galois extension of algebraic number fields with automorphism group 
 
 
 
 . Assume that 
 
 
 
  is an intermediate field with relative group 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be the maximal abelian subextension of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  respectively within 
 
 
 
 . Then the corresponding relative groups are the commutator subgroups 
 
 
 
 
 , resp. 
 
 
 
 . By class field theory, there exist intermediate groups 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that the Artin maps establish isomorphisms 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 . Here 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  means 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are some moduli divisible by 
 
 
 
 
  respectively and by all primes dividing 
 
 
 
  respectively. Furthermore assume 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
 . Suppose that 
 
 
 
  is a prime ideal of 
 
 
 
 
  which does not divide 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  be a prime ideal of 
 
 
 
  lying over 
 
 
 
 . The class extension homomorphism 
 
 
 
 
  and the Artin transfer, more precisely, the induced transfer

 
 , are connected by the commutative diagram in Figure 1 via these Artin isomorphisms, that is, we have equality of two composita 
 
 
 
 .5 The justification for this statement consists in analyzing the two paths of composite mappings.6 On the one hand, the class extension homomorphism 
 
 
 
  maps the generalized ideal class 
 
 
 
  of the base field 
 
 
 
 
  to the extension class 
 
 
 
  in the field 
 
 
 
 , and the Artin isomorphism 
 
 
 
  of the field 
 
 
 
  maps this product of classes of prime ideals to the product of conjugates of Frobenius automorphisms


 
  where the double coset decomposition and its representatives used here is the same as in the last but one section. On the other hand, the Artin isomorphism 
 
 
 
  of the base field 
 
 
 
  maps the generalized ideal class 
 
 
 
  to the Frobenius automorphism 
 
 
 
 . The 
 
 
 
 -tuple 
 
 
 
  is a system of representatives of double cosets 
 
 
 
 , which correspond to the orbits of the action of 
 
 
 
  on the set of left cosets 
 
 
 
  by left multiplication, and 
 
 
 
  is equal to the size of the orbit of coset 
 
 
 
  in this action. Hence the induced Artin transfer maps 
 
 
 
  to the product


 
 . This product expression was the original form of the Artin transfer homomorphism, corresponding to a decomposition of the permutation representation into disjoint cycles.7
Class field tower
The commutative diagram in the previous section, which connects the number theoretic class extension homomorphism

 
  with the group theoretic Artin transfer

 
 , enabled Furtw√§ngler to prove the principal ideal theorem by specializing to the situation that 
 
 
 
  is the first Hilbert class field of 
 
 
 
 , that is the maximal abelian unramified extension of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the second Hilbert class field of 
 
 
 
 , that is the maximal metabelian unramified extension of 
 
 
 
  (and maximal abelian unramified extension of 
 
 
 
 ). Then 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the commutator subgroup of 
 
 
 
 . More precisely, Furtw√§ngler showed that generally the Artin transfer 
 
 
 
  from a finite metabelian group 
 
 
 
  to its derived subgroup 
 
 
 
  maps all elements of 
 
 
 
  to the neutral element of 
 
 
 
 . In fact this is true even if 
 
 
 
  isn't metabelian because we can reduce to the metabelian case by replacing 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 . It also holds for infinite groups provided 
 
 
 
  is finitely generated and 
 
 
 
 .
However, the commutative diagram comprises the potential for a lot of more sophisticated applications. In the situation that 
 
 
 
  is a prime number, 
 
 
 
  is the second Hilbert p-class field of 
 
 
 
 , that is the maximal metabelian unramified extension of 
 
 
 
  of degree a power of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  varies over the intermediate field between 
 
 
 
  and its first Hilbert p-class field 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  correspondingly varies over the intermediate groups between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , computation of all principalization kernels 
 
 
 
  and all p-class groups 
 
 
 
  translates to information on the kernels 
 
 
 
  and targets 
 
 
 
  of the Artin transfers 
 
 
 
  and permits the exact specification of the second p-class group

 
  of 
 
 
 
  via pattern recognition, and frequently even allows to draw conclusions about the entire p-class field tower of 
 
 
 
 , that is the Galois group 
 
 
 
  of the maximal unramified pro-p extension 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 .
These ideas are explicit in the paper of 1934 by A. Scholz and O. Taussky already.8 At these early stages, pattern recognition consisted of specifying the annihilator ideals, or symbolic orders, and the Schreier relations of metabelian p-groups and subsequently using a uniqueness theorem on group extensions by O. Schreier.9 Nowadays, we use the p-group generation algorithm of M. F. Newman10 and E. A. O'Brien11 for constructing descendant trees of p-groups and searching patterns, defined by kernels and targets of Artin transfers, among the vertices of these trees.
Galois cohomology
In the chapter on cyclic relative extensions of prime degree of his number report 1897, D. Hilbert12 proves a series of crucial theorems which culminate in Theorem 94, the original germ of class field theory. Today, these theorems can be viewed as the beginning of what is now called Galois cohomology. Hilbert considers a finite relative extension 
 
 
 
  of algebraic number fields with cyclic Galois group 
 
 
 
  generated by an automorphism 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for the relative degree 
 
 
 
 , which is assumed to be an odd prime.
He investigates two endomorphism of the unit group

 
  of the extension field, viewed as a Galois module with respect to the group 
 
 
 
 , briefly a 
 
 
 
 -module. The first endomorphism 
 
 
 
  is the symbolic exponentiation with the difference 
 
 
 
 , and the second endomorphism 
 
 
 
  is the algebraic norm mapping, that is the symbolic exponentiation with the trace 
 
 
 
 . In fact, the image of the algebraic norm map is contained in the unit group 
 
 
 
  of the base field, and thus 
 
 
 
  coincides with the usual arithmetic norm as the product of all conjugates. The composita of the endomorphisms satisfy the relations 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Two important cohomology groups can be defined by means of the kernels and images of these endomorphisms. The zeroth cohomology group of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is given by the quotient 
 
 
 
  consisting of the norm residues of 
 
 
 
 , and the minus first cohomology group of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is given by the quotient 
 
 
 
  of the group 
 
 
 
  of relative units of 
 
 
 
  modulo the subgroup of symbolic powers of units with formal exponent 
 
 
 
 .
In his Theorem 92 Hilbert proves the existence of a relative unit 
 
 
 
  which cannot be expressed as 
 
 
 
 , for any unit 
 
 
 
 , which means that the minus first cohomology group 
 
 
 
  is non-trivial of order divisible by 
 
 
 
 . However, with the aid of a completely similar construction, the minus first cohomology group 
 
 
 
  of the 
 
 
 
 -module 
 
 
 
 , the multiplicative group of the superfield 
 
 
 
 , can be defined, and Hilbert shows its triviality 
 
 
 
  in his famous Theorem 90.
Eventually, Hilbert is in the position to state his celebrated Theorem 94: If 
 
 
 
  is a cyclic extension of number fields of odd prime degree 
 
 
 
  with trivial relative discriminant 
 
 
 
 , which means it's unramified at finite primes, then there exists a non-principal ideal 
 
 
 
  of the base field 
 
 
 
  which becomes principal in the extension field 
 
 
 
 , that is 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 . Furthermore the 
 
 
 
 th power of this non-principal ideal is principal in the base field 
 
 
 
 , in particular 
 
 
 
 , hence the class number of the base field must be divisible by 
 
 
 
  and the extension field 
 
 
 
  can be called a class field of 
 
 
 
 . The proof goes as follows: Theorem 92 says there exists unit 
 
 
 
 , then Theorem 90 ensures the existence of a (necessarily non-unit) 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , i. e., 
 
 
 
 . By multiplying 
 
 
 
  by proper integer if necessary we may assume that 
 
 
 
  is an algebraic integer. The non-unit 
 
 
 
  is generator of an ambiguous principal ideal of 
 
 
 
 , since 
 
 
 
 . However, the underlying ideal 
 
 
 
  of the subfield 
 
 
 
  cannot be principal. Assume to the contrary that 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  is unramified, every ambiguous ideal 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is a lift of some ideal in 
 
 
 
 , in particular 
 
 
 
 . Hence 
 
 
 
  and thus 
 
 
 
  for some unit 
 
 
 
 . This would imply the contradiction 
 
 
 
  because 
 
 
 
 . On the other hand 
 
 
 
 , thus 
 
 
 
  is principal in the base field 
 
 
 
  already.
Theorems 92 and 94 don't hold as stated for 
 
 
 
 . The reason is Hilbert only considers ramification at finite primes but not at infinite primes (we say that a real infinite prime of 
 
 
 
  ramifies in 
 
 
 
  if there exists non-real extension of this prime to 
 
 
 
 ). This doesn't make a difference when 
 
 
 
  is odd since the extension is then unramified at infinite primes. However he notes that Theorems 92 and 94 hold for 
 
 
 
  provided we further assume that number of fields conjugate to 
 
 
 
  that are real is twice the number of real fields conjugate to 
 
 
 
 . This condition is equvalent to 
 
 
 
  being unramified at infinite primes, so Theorem 94 holds for all primes 
 
 
 
  if we assume that 
 
 
 
  is unramified at all primes.
Theorem 94 implies the simple inequality 
 
 
 
  for the order of the principalization kernel of the extension 
 
 
 
 . However an exact formula for the order of this kernel can be derived for cyclic unramified (including infinite primes) extension (not necessarily of prime degree) by means of the Herbrand quotient13

 
  of the 
 
 
 
 -module 
 
 
 
 , which is given by



It can be shown that 
 
 
 
  (without calculating the order of either of the cohomology groups). Since the extension 
 
 
 
  is unramified, it's 
 
 
 
  so 
 
 
 
  . With the aid of K. Iwasawa's isomorphism14

 
 , specialized to a cyclic extension with periodic cohomology of length 
 
 
 
 , we obtain






This relation increases the lower bound by the factor 
 
 
 
 , the so-called unit norm index.
History
As mentioned in the lead section, several investigators tried to generalize the Hilbert-Artin-Furtw√§ngler principal ideal theorem of 1930 to questions concerning the principalization in intermediate extensions between the base field and its Hilbert cass field. On the one hand, they established general theorems on the principalization over arbitrary number fields, such as Ph. Furtw√§ngler 1932,15 O. Taussky 1932,16 O. Taussky 1970,17 and H. Kisilevsky 1970.18 On the other hand, they searched for concrete numerical examples of principalization in unramified cyclic extensions of particular kinds of base fields.
Quadratic fields
The principalization of 
 
 
 
 -classes of complex quadratic number fields 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 -class rank two in unramified cyclic cubic extensions was calculated manually for three discriminants 
 
 
 
  by A. Scholz and O. Taussky19 in 1934. Since these calculations require composition of binary quadratic forms and explicit knowledge of fundamental systems of units in cubic number fields, which was a very difficult task in 1934, the investigations stayed at rest for half a century until F.-P. Heider and B. Schmithals20 employed the CDC Cyber 76 computer at the University of Cologne to extend the information concerning principalization to the range 
 
 
 
  containing 
 
 
 
  relevant discriminants in 1982, thereby providing the first analysis of five real quadratic fields. Two years later, J. R. Brink21 computed the principalization types of 
 
 
 
  complex quadratic fields. Currently, the most extensive computation of principalization data for all 
 
 
 
  quadratic fields with discriminants 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 -class group of type 
 
 
 
  is due to D. C. Mayer in 2010,22 who used his recently discovered connection between transfer kernels and transfer targets for the design of a new principalization algorithm.23
The 
 
 
 
 -principalization in unramified quadratic extensions of complex quadratic fields with 
 
 
 
 -class group of type 
 
 
 
  was studied by H. Kisilevsky in 1976.24 Similar investigations of real quadratic fields were carried out by E. Benjamin and C. Snyder in 1995.25
Cubic fields
The 
 
 
 
 -principalization in unramified quadratic extensions of cyclic cubic number fields with 
 
 
 
 -class group of type 
 
 
 
  was investigated by A. Derhem in 1988.26 Seven years later, M. Ayadi studied the 
 
 
 
 -principalization in unramified cyclic cubic extensions of cyclic cubic fields 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 -class group of type 
 
 
 
  and conductor 
 
 
 
  divisible by two or three primes.27
Sextic fields
In 1992, M. C. Ismaili investigated the 
 
 
 
 -principalization in unramified cyclic cubic extensions of the normal closure of pure cubic fields 
 
 
 
 , in the case that this sextic number field 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , has a 
 
 
 
 -class group of type 
 
 
 
 .28
Quartic fields
In 1993, A. Azizi studied the 
 
 
 
 -principalization in unramified quadratic extensions of bicyclic biquadratic fields of Dirichlet type 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 -class group of type 
 
 
 
 .29 Most recently, in 2014, A. Zekhnini extended the investigations to Dirichlet fields with 
 
 
 
 -class group of type 
 
 
 
 ,30 thus providing the first examples of 
 
 
 
 -principalization in the two layers of unramified quadratic and biquadratic extensions of quartic fields with class groups of 
 
 
 
 -rank three.
