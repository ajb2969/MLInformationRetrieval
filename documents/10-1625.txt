   Carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cyclase      Carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cyclase   In enzymology , a carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cyclase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-carboxy-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 3-carboxy-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate , and one product , 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically the class of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-carboxy-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate lyase (decyclizing) . This enzyme is also called 3-carboxymuconate cyclase . This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
