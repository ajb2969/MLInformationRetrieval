   Noncommutative projective geometry      Noncommutative projective geometry   In mathematics, noncommutative projective geometry is a noncommutative analog of projective geometry in the setting of noncommutative algebraic geometry .  Examples   The quantum plane, the most basic example, is the quotient ring of the free ring:          k   ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩    /   (    y  x   -   q  x  y    )         k   x  y        y  x     q  x  y      k\langle x,y\rangle/(yx-qxy)         More generally, the quantum polynomial ring is the quotient ring:          k   ⟨   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   ⟩    /   (     x  i    x  j    -    q   i  j     x  j    x  i     )         k    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n          subscript  x  i    subscript  x  j       subscript  q    i  j     subscript  x  j    subscript  x  i       k\langle x_{1},\dots,x_{n}\rangle/(x_{i}x_{j}-q_{ij}x_{j}x_{i})        Proj construction  By definition, the Proj of a graded ring R is the quotient category of the category of finitely generated graded modules over R by the subcategory of torsion modules. If R is a commutative Noetherian graded ring generated by degree-one elements, then the Proj of R in this sense is equivalent to the category of coherent sheaves on the usual Proj of R . Hence, the construction can be thought of as a generalization of the Proj construction for a commutative graded ring.
