   Picard–Fuchs equation      Picard–Fuchs equation   In mathematics , the Picard–Fuchs equation , named after Émile Picard and Lazarus Fuchs , is a linear ordinary differential equation whose solutions describe the periods of elliptic curves .  Definition  Let      j  =    g  2  3     g  2  3   -   27   g  3  2          j     superscript   subscript  g  2   3      superscript   subscript  g  2   3     27   superscript   subscript  g  3   2        j=\frac{g_{2}^{3}}{g_{2}^{3}-27g_{3}^{2}}     be the j-invariant with    g  2     subscript  g  2    g_{2}   and    g  3     subscript  g  3    g_{3}   the modular invariants of the elliptic curve in Weierstrass form :        y  2   =    4   x  3    -    g  2   x   -   g  3     .       superscript  y  2       4   superscript  x  3       subscript  g  2   x    subscript  g  3      y^{2}=4x^{3}-g_{2}x-g_{3}.\,     Note that the j -invariant is an isomorphism from the Riemann surface     ℍ  /  Γ      ℍ  normal-Γ    \mathbb{H}/\Gamma   to the Riemann sphere     ℂ  ∪   {  ∞  }       ℂ       \mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}   ; where   ℍ   ℍ   \mathbb{H}   is the upper half-plane and   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is the modular group . The Picard–Fuchs equation is then          d  2   y    d   j  2     +    1  j     d  y    d  j     +      31  j   -  4    144   j  2     (   1  -  j   )   2     y    =   0.              superscript  d  2   y     d   superscript  j  2         1  j       d  y     d  j             31  j   4     144   superscript  j  2    superscript    1  j   2     y    0.    \frac{d^{2}y}{dj^{2}}+\frac{1}{j}\frac{dy}{dj}+\frac{31j-4}{144j^{2}(1-j)^{2}}%
 y=0.\,     Written in Q-form , one has          d  2   f    d   j  2     +      1  -   1968  j    +   2654208   j  2      4   j  2     (   1  -   1728  j    )   2     f    =   0.              superscript  d  2   f     d   superscript  j  2             1    1968  j      2654208   superscript  j  2       4   superscript  j  2    superscript    1    1728  j    2     f    0.    \frac{d^{2}f}{dj^{2}}+\frac{1-1968j+2654208j^{2}}{4j^{2}(1-1728j)^{2}}f=0.\,     Solutions  This equation can be cast into the form of the hypergeometric differential equation . It has two linearly independent solutions, called the periods of elliptic functions. The ratio of the two periods is equal to the period ratio τ, the standard coordinate on the upper-half plane. However, the ratio of two solutions of the hypergeometric equation is also known as a Schwarz triangle map .  The Picard–Fuchs equation can be cast into the form of Riemann's differential equation , and thus solutions can be directly read off in terms of Riemann P-functions . One has       y   (  j  )    =   P   {     0    1    ∞          1  /  6      1  /  4     0    j       -   1  /   6        3  /  4     0        }          y  j     P     0  1   absent      1  6     1  4   0  j        1  6      3  4   0  absent        y(j)=P\left\{\begin{matrix}0&1&\infty&\\
 {1/6}&{1/4}&0&j\\
 {-1/6\;}&{3/4}&0&\end{matrix}\right\}\,     At least four methods to find the j-function inverse can be given.  Dedekind defines the j -function by its Schwarz derivative in his letter to Borchardt. As a partial fraction, it reveals the geometry of the fundamental domain:       2  S  τ   (  j  )    =     1  -   1  4      (   1  -  j   )   2    +    1  -   1  9     j  2    +    1  -   1  4   -   1  9     j   (   1  -  j   )      =    3   4    (   1  -  j   )   2     +   8   9   j  2     +   23   36  j   (   1  -  j   )              2  S  τ  j         1    1  4     superscript    1  j   2        1    1  9     superscript  j  2        1    1  4     1  9      j    1  j               3    4   superscript    1  j   2       8    9   superscript  j  2       23    36  j    1  j         2S\tau(j)=\frac{1-\frac{1}{4}}{(1-j)^{2}}+\frac{1-\frac{1}{9}}{j^{2}}+\frac{1-%
 \frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{9}}{j(1-j)}=\frac{3}{4(1-j)^{2}}+\frac{8}{9j^{2}}+\frac{2%
