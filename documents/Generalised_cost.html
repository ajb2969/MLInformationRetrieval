<h1>Generalised cost</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a href="transport_economics" title="wikilink">transport economics</a>, the <strong>generalized cost</strong> is the sum of the <a class="uri" href="monetary" title="wikilink">monetary</a> and non-monetary costs of a journey.</p>

<p>Monetary (or "<a href="Out-of-pocket_expenses" title="wikilink">out-of-pocket</a>") costs might include a <a class="uri" href="fare" title="wikilink">fare</a> on a <a href="public_transport" title="wikilink">public transport</a> journey, or the costs of <a class="uri" href="fuel" title="wikilink">fuel</a>, <a href="wear_and_tear" title="wikilink">wear and tear</a> and any parking charge, <a href="road_pricing" title="wikilink">toll or congestion charge</a> on a <a class="uri" href="car" title="wikilink">car</a> journey.</p>

<p>Non-monetary costs refer to the time spent undertaking the journey. Time is converted to a money value using a <a href="value_of_time" title="wikilink">value of time</a> figure, which usually varies according to the traveller's income and the purpose of the trip.</p>

<p>The generalised cost is equivalent to the price of the good in <a href="supply_and_demand" title="wikilink">supply and demand</a> theory, and so demand for journeys can be related to the generalised cost of those journeys using the <a href="price_elasticity_of_demand" title="wikilink">price elasticity of demand</a>. Supply is equivalent to capacity (and, for roads, road quality) on the network</p>

<p>The additional term <em>v(q,w)</em> refers to the opportunity cost of the additional journey time a traveller experiences because of congestion. In transport economic models, the parameter <em>q</em> is the demand and <em>w</em> is a measure of capacity (which is relevant when considering possible capacity expansion).</p>

<p>For example, if the travel time on a particular stretch of road increases by 10 minutes for every 1000 vehicles per hour that use the road, if <em>q</em> were measured in thousands of vehicles per hour, we would consider the congestion function to be

<h2 id="weighting-different-types-of-time">Weighting different types of time</h2>

<p>It has been observed that travellers prefer time spent on some parts of their journey over time spent on others. A typical journey can be divided into four parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walk from the origin</li>
<li>Wait for the vehicle</li>
<li>Ride in the vehicle</li>
<li>Walk to the destination</li>
</ul>

<p>(All of these apply to public transport journeys; the wait for the vehicle does not generally apply to car or <a class="uri" href="bicycle" title="wikilink">bicycle</a> journeys, and for walk-only journeys, there is no division into parts.)</p>

<p>Typically, although travellers "dislike" all time spent travelling, they dislike walking and waiting parts of the journey more than in-vehicle journey time, and thus would be willing to pay more to avoid them. This results in a higher value of time for those parts of the journey than the main in-vehicle part of the journey. The function <em>u(w)</em> mentioned earlier can therefore be considered to consist of differing sets of valued time.</p>

<p>An alternative approach to applying different values of time to each part of the journey is to apply a weighting to time spent on each different part of the journey which quantifies the level of dislike a traveller has for time spent on that bit of the journey relative to time spent in-vehicle. For example, if a traveller considers 12 minutes' walk to be "as bad" as 10 minutes in a vehicle, then each minute of walking time is equivalent to 1.2 minutes of in-vehicle time. In this manner, all parts of the journey can be converted into their equivalent in-vehicle time.</p>

<p>Once the equivalent in-vehicle time for the whole journey is calculated, this can be converted to a monetary value as described earlier.</p>
<h2 id="generalised-time">Generalised time</h2>

<p>If the monetary cost of the journey (<em>p</em>) is considered to be irrelevant for the purposes of the exercise (for example, when comparing different journey options through a public transport network when fares are constant), there is no need to convert the generalised cost to a currency value - instead, it can be left in units of time, as long as all time is equivalent (for example, if all time is converted to in-vehicle time). These units of time may be referred to as <strong>generalised time</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<h3 id="generalised-cost-of-car-journeys-uncongested">Generalised cost of car journeys (uncongested)</h3>

<p>A shopper decides to make a night-time visit to the 24-hour supermarket, which is 8 km away. His car uses petrol such that the cost of the petrol is £0.10/km. The journey takes 12 minutes, and the shopper has a value of time of £4.50/hour.</p>

<p>In this case, <em>p</em> = £0.80, <em>t</em> = 0.2hrs and <em>τ</em> = £4.50/hr, so <em>u</em> = £0.90 and therefore <em>g</em> = £0.80 + £0.90 = £1.70.</p>
<h3 id="generalised-cost-of-car-journeys-with-congestion">Generalised cost of car journeys (with congestion)</h3>

<p>A commuter drives to work 50 km along a busy motorway, which includes a bridge with a toll of £2. She has a value of time of £12/hr and spends £0.15/km on fuel. The journey time is 40 minutes when few other cars are around, but it increases by 3 minutes for every 1000 vehicles on the motorway. At the time she travels, the motorway carries 10,000 vehicles per hour.</p>

<p>Here the monetary cost includes both fuel and a fixed toll, so <em>p</em> = £2 + (£0.15/km × 50 km) = £9.50. The uncongested journey time is 40 minutes, so as she values time (<em>τ</em>) at £12/hr, <em>u</em> = £8. The additional journey time (in hours) due to congestion (can be calculated as

 where at this time of day, <em>q</em> = 10, so the journey is 30 minutes longer because of congestion delays. This makes <em>v</em> = £6.</p>

<p>Therefore the generalised cost of the journey is £9.50 + £8 + £6 = £23.50.</p>

<p>NB: the function <em>v(q)</em> is usually rather more complicated than suggested here, because the relationship between journey time and congestion is rarely linear! (see <a href="traffic_engineering_(transportation)" title="wikilink">traffic engineering (transportation)</a>)</p>
<h3 id="generalised-cost-of-public-transport-journeys">Generalised cost of public transport journeys</h3>

<p>A teacher uses the <a href="London_Underground" title="wikilink">Tube</a> as the main part of his journey from home to his school. There are two ways he could get there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walk to a nearby Tube station (5 minutes away) which has trains every 8 minutes to the station closest to the school (4 minutes' walk away) and which take 20 minutes to reach that station.</li>
<li>Walk to a farther Tube station (10 minutes away) which has a better service (every 3 minutes) but runs to a station further away from the school (7 minutes' walk), taking 15 minutes to reach that station.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fares are the same on both routes, and the teacher dislikes waiting time 1.2 times more than in-vehicle time (IVT), and dislikes walking time 1.5 times more than IVT.</p>

<p>We can calculate which route is preferable by comparing generalised time (measured in terms of IVT) for each.</p>

<p>For the first route, waiting time is, on average, 4 minutes, and total walking time is 9 minutes. Therefore the total generalised time for this route is 4×1.2 + 9×1.5 + 20 = 38.3 minutes.</p>

<p>For the second route, waiting time is an average of 1.5 minutes, and total walking time is 17 minutes. Generalised time is 1.5×1.2 + 17×1.5 + 15 = 42.3 minutes.</p>

<p>Therefore the teacher should choose the first route, even though the frequency of service is lower and the journey time is longer.</p>
