Chowla–Mordell theorem

In mathematics, the Chowla–Mordell theorem is a result in number theory determining cases where a Gauss sum is the square root of a prime number, multiplied by a root of unity. It was proved and published independently by Sarvadaman Chowla and Louis Mordell, around 1951.
In detail, if 
 
 
 
  is a prime number, 
 
 
 
  a nontrivial Dirichlet character modulo

 
 , and



where 
 
 
 
  is a primitive 
 
 
 
 -th root of unity in the complex numbers, then



is a root of unity if and only if 
 
 
 
  is the quadratic residue symbol modulo 
 
 
 
 . The 'if' part was known to Gauss: the contribution of Chowla and Mordell was the 'only if' direction. The ratio in the theorem occurs in the functional equation of L-functions.
