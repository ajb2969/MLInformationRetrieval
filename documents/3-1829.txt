   Chowla–Mordell theorem      Chowla–Mordell theorem   In mathematics , the Chowla–Mordell theorem is a result in number theory determining cases where a Gauss sum is the square root of a prime number , multiplied by a root of unity . It was proved and published independently by Sarvadaman Chowla and Louis Mordell , around 1951.  In detail, if   p   p   p   is a prime number,   χ   χ   \chi   a nontrivial Dirichlet character  modulo    p   p   p   , and       G   (  χ  )    =   ∑   χ   (  a  )    ζ  a           G  χ       χ  a   superscript  ζ  a       G(\chi)=\sum\chi(a)\zeta^{a}     where   ζ   ζ   \zeta   is a primitive   p   p   p   -th root of unity in the complex numbers , then       G   (  χ  )     |   G   (  χ  )    |         G  χ       G  χ      \frac{G(\chi)}{|G(\chi)|}     is a root of unity if and only if   χ   χ   \chi   is the quadratic residue symbol modulo   p   p   p   . The 'if' part was known to Gauss : the contribution of Chowla and Mordell was the 'only if' direction. The ratio in the theorem occurs in the functional equation of L-functions .
