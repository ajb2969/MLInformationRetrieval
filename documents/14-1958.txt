   Bott residue formula      Bott residue formula   In mathematics, the Bott residue formula , introduced by , describes a sum over the fixed points of a holomorphic vector field of a compact complex manifold.  Statement  If v is a holomorphic vector field on a compact complex manifold M , then        ∑    v   (  p  )    =  0      P   (   A  p   )     det   A  p      =    ∫  M    P   (     i  Θ   /  2   π   )           subscript       v  p   0        P   subscript  A  p       subscript  A  p        subscript   M     P        i  normal-Θ   2   π       \sum_{v(p)=0}\frac{P(A_{p})}{\det A_{p}}=\int_{M}P(i\Theta/2\pi)   where   The sum is over the fixed points p of the vector field v  The linear transformation A p is the action induced by v on the holomorphic tangent space at p  P is an invariant polynomial function of matrices of degree dim( M )  Θ is a curvature matrix of the holomorphic tangent bundle   See also   Atiyah–Bott fixed-point theorem  Holomorphic Lefschetz fixed-point formula   References      "  Category:Complex manifolds
