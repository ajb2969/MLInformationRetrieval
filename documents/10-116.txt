Flexural modulus

In mechanics (a branch of physics), the flexural modulus or bending modulus1 is the ratio of stress to strain in flexural deformation, or the tendency for a material to bend. It is determined from the slope of a stress-strain curve produced by a flexural test (such as the ASTM D 790), and uses units of force per area.2 It is an intensive property.

Ideally, flexural or bending modulus of elasticity is equivalent to the tensile or compressive modulus of elasticity. In reality, these values may be different, especially for plastic materials.
