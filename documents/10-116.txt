   Flexural modulus      Flexural modulus   In mechanics (a branch of physics ), the flexural modulus or bending modulus 1 is the ratio of stress to strain in flexural deformation , or the tendency for a material to bend. It is determined from the slope of a stress-strain curve produced by a flexural test (such as the ASTM D 790), and uses units of force per area. 2 It is an intensive property .  thumb|upright=2.0|Flexural modulus measurement For a 3-point test of a rectangular beam behaving as an isotropic linear material, where w and h are the width and height of the beam, L is the distance between the two outer supports and d is the deflection due to the load F applied at the middle of the beam, the flexural modulus: 3       E  bend   =     L  3   F    4  w   h  3   d         subscript  E  bend        superscript  L  3   F     4  w   superscript  h  3   d      E_{\mathrm{bend}}=\frac{L^{3}F}{4wh^{3}d}   From elastic beam theory    d  =     L  3   F    48  I  E        d       superscript  L  3   F     48  I  E      d=\frac{L^{3}F}{48IE}   and for rectangular beam    I  =    1  12   w   h  3        I      1  12   w   superscript  h  3      I=\frac{1}{12}wh^{3}     thus     E  bend   =  E       subscript  E  bend   E    E_{\mathrm{bend}}=E   (Elastic modulus)  Ideally, flexural or bending modulus of elasticity is equivalent to the tensile or compressive modulus of elasticity. In reality, these values may be different, especially for plastic materials.
