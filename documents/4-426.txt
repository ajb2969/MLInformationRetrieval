   Reissner–Nordström metric      Reissner–Nordström metric   In physics and astronomy , the Reissner–Nordström metric is a static solution to the Einstein-Maxwell field equations , which corresponds to the gravitational field of a charged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric body of mass M .  The metric was discovered by Hans Reissner and Gunnar Nordström .  These four related solutions may be summarized by the following table:       Non-rotating ( J = 0)   Rotating ( J ≠ 0)     Uncharged ( Q = 0)   Schwarzschild   Kerr     Charged ( Q ≠ 0)   Reissner–Nordström   Kerr–Newman     where Q represents the body's electric charge and J represents its spin angular momentum .  The metric  In spherical coordinates ( t , r , θ, φ), the line element for the Reissner–Nordström metric is        d   s  2    =     (    1  -    r  S   r    +    r  Q  2    r  2     )     c  2    d   t  2    -     (    1  -    r  S   r    +    r  Q  2    r  2     )    -  1    d   r  2    -     r  2    d   Ω   (  2  )   2      ,        d   superscript  s  2            1     subscript  r  normal-S   r       superscript   subscript  r  Q   2    superscript  r  2      superscript  c  2   d   superscript  t  2       superscript      1     subscript  r  normal-S   r       superscript   subscript  r  Q   2    superscript  r  2       1    d   superscript  r  2       superscript  r  2   d   subscript   superscript  normal-Ω  2   2       ds^{2}=\left(1-\frac{r_{\mathrm{S}}}{r}+\frac{r_{Q}^{2}}{r^{2}}\right)c^{2}\,%

Here 1/4πε 0 is Coulomb force constant . 1  In the limit that the charge Q (or equivalently, the length-scale r Q ) goes to zero, one recovers the Schwarzschild metric . The classical Newtonian theory of gravity may then be recovered in the limit as the ratio r S / r goes to zero. In that limit that both r Q / r and r S / r go to zero, the metric becomes the Minkowski metric for special relativity .  In practice, the ratio r S / r is often extremely small. For example, the Schwarzschild radius of the Earth is roughly 9 mm (3/8 inch ), whereas a satellite in a geosynchronous orbit has a radius r that is roughly four billion times larger, at 42,164 km (26,200 miles ). Even at the surface of the Earth, the corrections to Newtonian gravity are only one part in a billion. The ratio only becomes large close to black holes and other ultra-dense objects such as neutron stars .  Charged Blackholes  Although charged black holes with r Q ≪ r S are similar to the Schwarzschild black hole , they have two horizons: the event horizon and an internal Cauchy horizon . 2 As with the Schwarzschild metric, the event horizons for the spacetime are located where the metric component g rr diverges; that is, where       0  =   1  /   g   r  r     =    1  -    r  S   r    +    r  Q  2    r  2      .        0    1   superscript  g    r  r              1     subscript  r  normal-S   r       superscript   subscript  r  Q   2    superscript  r  2        0=1/g^{rr}=1-\frac{r_{\mathrm{S}}}{r}+\frac{r_{Q}^{2}}{r^{2}}.     This equation has two solutions:        r  ±   =    1  2    (    r  s   ±     r  s  2   -   4   r  Q  2       )     .       subscript  r  plus-or-minus       1  2    plus-or-minus   subscript  r  s        superscript   subscript  r  s   2     4   superscript   subscript  r  Q   2          r_{\pm}=\frac{1}{2}\left(r_{s}\pm\sqrt{r_{s}^{2}-4r_{Q}^{2}}\right).     These concentric event horizons become degenerate for 2 r Q = r S , which corresponds to an extremal black hole . Black holes with 2 r Q > r S are believed not to exist in nature because they would contain a naked singularity ; their appearance would contradict Roger Penrose 's cosmic censorship hypothesis which is generally believed to be true. Theories with supersymmetry usually guarantee that such "superextremal" black holes cannot exist.  The electromagnetic potential is        A  α   =   (   Q  /  r   ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  )    .       subscript  A  α      Q  r   0  0  0     A_{\alpha}=\left(Q/r,0,0,0\right).     If magnetic monopoles are included in the theory, then a generalization to include magnetic charge P is obtained by replacing Q 2 by Q 2 + P 2 in the metric and including the term P cos θ d φ in the electromagnetic potential.
