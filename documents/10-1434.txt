   4-(dimethylamino)phenylazoxybenzene reductase      4-(dimethylamino)phenylazoxybenzene reductase   In enzymology , a 4-(dimethylamino)phenylazoxybenzene reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-(dimethylamino)phenylazobenzene + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-(dimethylamino)phenylazoxybenzene + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-(dimethylamino)phenylazobenzene and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 4-(dimethylamino)phenylazoxybenzene , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-(dimethylamino)phenylazobenzene:NADP+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include N,N-dimethyl-p-aminoazobenzene oxide reductase , dimethylaminoazobenzene N-oxide reductase , NADPH-dependent DMAB N-oxide reductase , and NADPH:4-(dimethylamino)phenylazoxybenzene oxidoreductase .
