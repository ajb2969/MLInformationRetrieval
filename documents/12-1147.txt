Lawrence–Krammer representation

In mathematics the Lawrence–Krammer representation is a representation of the braid groups. It fits into a family of representations called the Lawrence representations. The 1st Lawrence representation is the Burau representation and the 2nd is the Lawrence–Krammer representation.
The Lawrence–Krammer representation is named after Ruth Lawrence and Daan Krammer.1
Definition
Consider the braid group

 
  to be the mapping class group of a disc with n marked points 
 
 
 
 . The Lawrence–Krammer representation is defined as the action of 
 
 
 
  on the homology of a certain covering space of the configuration space

 
 
 . Specifically, 
 
 
 
 , and the subspace of 
 
 
 
  invariant under the action of 
 
 
 
  is primitive, free and of rank 2. Generators for this invariant subspace are denoted by 
 
 
 
 .
The covering space of 
 
 
 
 
  corresponding to the kernel of the projection map



is called the Lawrence–Krammer cover and is denoted 
 
 
 
 . Diffeomorphisms of
 
 
 
  act on 
 
 
 
 , thus also on 
 
 
 
 
 , moreover they lift uniquely to diffeomorphisms of 
 
 
 
  which restrict to identity on the co-dimension two boundary stratum (where both points are on the boundary circle). The action of 
 
 
 
  on



thought of as a


 
 -module,
is the Lawrence–Krammer representation. 
 
 
 
 
  is known to be a free 
 
 
 
 -module, of rank 
 
 
 
 .
Matrices
Using Bigelow's conventions for the Lawrence–Krammer representation, generators for 
 
 
 
  are denoted 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 
 . Letting 
 
 
 
  denote the standard Artin generators of the braid group, we get the expression:



Faithfulness
Stephen Bigelow and Daan Krammer have independent proofs that the Lawrence–Krammer representation is faithful.
Geometry
The Lawrence–Krammer representation preserves a non-degenerate sesquilinear form which is known to be negative-definite Hermitian provided 
 
 
 
  are specialized to suitable unit complex numbers (q near 1 and t near i). Thus the braid group is a subgroup of the unitary group of 
 
 
 
 -square matrices. Recently it has been shown that the image of the Lawrence–Krammer representation is dense subgroup of the unitary group in this case.
The sesquilinear form has the explicit description:
$\langle v_{i,j}, v_{k,l}\rangle = -(1-t)(1+qt)(q-1)^2t^{-2}q^{-3}
 \left\{
 \begin{array}{lr}
 -q^2t^2(q-1) & i=k
