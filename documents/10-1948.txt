   Aspartate 4-decarboxylase      Aspartate 4-decarboxylase   In enzymology , an aspartate 4-decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-aspartate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-alanine + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , L-aspartate , and two products , L-alanine and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-aspartate 4-carboxy-lyase (L-alanine-forming) . Other names in common use include desulfinase , aminomalonic decarboxylase , aspartate beta-decarboxylase , aspartate omega-decarboxylase , aspartic omega-decarboxylase , aspartic beta-decarboxylase , L-aspartate beta-decarboxylase , cysteine sulfinic desulfinase , L-cysteine sulfinate acid desulfinase , and L-aspartate 4-carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in alanine and aspartate metabolism and cysteine metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .
