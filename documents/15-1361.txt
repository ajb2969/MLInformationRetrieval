   Botryococcene C-methyltransferase      Botryococcene C-methyltransferase   Botryococcene C-methyltransferase (, TMT-3 ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:botryococcene C-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + C30 botryococcene    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3,20-dimethyl-1,2,21,22-tetradehydro-2,3,20,21-tetrahydrobotryococcene (overall reaction)  (1a) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + C30 botryococcene   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3-methyl-1,2-didehydro-2,3-dihydrobotryococcene  (1b) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 3-methyl-1,2-didehydro-2,3-dihydrobotryococcene   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3,20-dimethyl-1,2,21,22-tetradehydro-2,3,20,21-tetrahydrobotryococcene  (2a) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + C30 botryococcene   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 20-methyl-21,22-didehydro-20,21-dihydrobotryococcene  (2b) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 20-methyl-21,22-didehydro-20,21-dihydrobotryococcene   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3,20-dimethyl-1,2,21,22-tetradehydro-2,3,20,21-tetrahydrobotryococcene   This enzyme is isolated from the green alga  Botryococcus braunii BOT22 .
