   Graph power      Graph power   In graph theory , a branch of mathematics, the k th power  G k of an undirected graph  G is another graph that has the same set of vertices , but in which two vertices are adjacent when their distance in G is at most k . Powers of graphs are referred to using terminology similar to that for exponentiation of numbers: G 2 is called the square of G , G 3 is called the cube of G , etc. 1  Graph powers should be distinguished from the products of a graph with itself, which (unlike powers) generally have many more vertices than the original graph.  Properties  If a graph has diameter  d , then its d -th power is the complete graph . 2  Coloring  Graph coloring on the square of a graph may be used to assign frequencies to the participants of wireless communication networks so that no two participants interfere with each other at any of their common neighbors, 3 and to find graph drawings with high angular resolution . 4  Both the chromatic number and the degeneracy of the k th power of a planar graph of maximum degree Δ are    O   (   Δ   ⌊   k  /  2   ⌋    )       O   superscript  normal-Δ      k  2       O(\Delta^{\lfloor k/2\rfloor})   , where the degeneracy bound shows that a greedy coloring algorithm may be used to color the graph with this many colors. 5 For the special case of a square of a planar graph, Wegner conjectured in 1977 that the chromatic number of the square of a planar graph is at most    max   (   d  +  5   ,     3  d   2   +  1   )         d  5         3  d   2   1     \max\left(d+5,\frac{3d}{2}+1\right)   , and it is known that the chromatic number is at most      5  d   3   +   O   (  1  )            5  d   3     O  1     \frac{5d}{3}+O(1)   . 6 7 More generally, for any graph with degeneracy d and maximum degree Δ, the degeneracy of the square of the graph is O ( d Δ), so many types of sparse graph other than the planar graphs also have squares whose chromatic number is proportional to Δ.  Although the chromatic number of the square of a nonplanar graph with maximum degree Δ may be proportional to Δ 2 in the worst case, it is smaller for graphs of high girth , being bounded by O(Δ 2 /log Δ) in this case. 8  Determining the minimum number of colors needed to color the square of a graph is NP-hard , even in the planar case. 9  Hamiltonicity  The cube of every connected graph necessarily contains a Hamiltonian cycle . 10 It is not necessarily the case that the square of a connected graph is Hamiltonian, and it is NP-complete to determine whether the square is Hamiltonian. 11 Nevertheless, by Fleischner's theorem , the square of a 2-vertex-connected graph is always Hamiltonian. 12  Computational complexity  The k th power of a graph with n vertices and m edges may be computed in time O( mn ) by performing a breadth first search starting from each vertex to determine the distances to all other vertices. Alternatively, If A is an adjacency matrix for the graph, modified to have nonzero entries on its main diagonal, then the nonzero entries of A k give the adjacency matrix of the k th power of the graph, from which it follows that constructing k th powers may be performed in an amount of time that is within a logarithmic factor of the time for matrix multiplication .  The induced subgraph of the k th power of a tree , induced by the leaves of the tree, may be recognized in polynomial time ; this problem has applications in phylogeny . 13  The first hardness result was the following: Given a graph, deciding whether it is the square of another graph is NP-complete . 14 Moreover, it is NP-complete to determine whether a graph is a k th power of another graph, for a given number k ≥ 2, or whether it is a k th power of a bipartite graph , for k > 2. 15  References  "  Category:Graph operations     . ↩  ↩   . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  list publications proving NP-hardness for general graphs by McCormick (1983) and Lin and Skiena (1995), and for planar graphs by Ramanathan and Lloyd (1992, 1993). ↩  , p. 105. ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩
