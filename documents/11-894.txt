D-tryptophan N-acetyltransferase




D-tryptophan N-acetyltransferase

In enzymology, a D-tryptophan N-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acetyl-CoA + D-tryptophan 
 
 
 
  CoA + N-acetyl-D-tryptophan
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and D-tryptophan, whereas its two products are CoA and N-acetyl-D-tryptophan.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:D-tryptophan N-acetyltransferase. Other names in common use include D-tryptophan acetyltransferase, and acetyl-CoA-D-tryptophan-alpha-N-acetyltransferase.
