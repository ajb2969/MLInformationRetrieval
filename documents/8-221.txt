Demand set

A demand set is a model of the most-preferred bundle of goods an agent can afford. The set is a function of the preference relation for this agent, the prices of goods, and the agent's endowment.
Assuming the agent cannot have a negative quantity of any good, the demand set can be characterized this way:
Define 
 
 
 
  as the number of goods the agent might receive an allocation of. An allocation to the agent is an element of the space 
 
 
 
 ; that is, the space of nonnegative real vectors of dimension

 
 .
Define 
 
 
 
  as a weak preference relation over goods; that is, 
 
 
 
  states that the allocation vector 
 
 
 
  is weakly preferred to 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be a vector representing the quantities of the agent's endowment of each possible good, and 
 
 
 
  be a vector of prices for those goods. Let 
 
 
 
  denote the demand set. Then: D(>p,p,e) = {x: px p x' for all affordable bundles x'.
