   Demand set      Demand set   A demand set is a model of the most-preferred bundle of goods an agent can afford. The set is a function of the preference relation for this agent, the prices of goods , and the agent's endowment .  Assuming the agent cannot have a negative quantity of any good, the demand set can be characterized this way:  Define   L   L   L   as the number of goods the agent might receive an allocation of. An allocation to the agent is an element of the space    R  +  l      R  l    R+l   ; that is, the space of nonnegative real vectors of dimension    L   L   L   .  Define     >  p      absent  p    >p   as a weak preference relation over goods; that is,    x  >   p   x  ′        x    p   superscript  x  normal-′      x>px^{\prime}   states that the allocation vector   x   x   x   is weakly preferred to    x  ′     superscript  x  normal-′    x^{\prime}   .  Let   e   e   e   be a vector representing the quantities of the agent's endowment of each possible good, and   p   p   p   be a vector of prices for those goods. Let    D   (  >  p  ,  p  ,  e  )      fragments  D   fragments  normal-(   p  normal-,  p  normal-,  e  normal-)     D(>p,p,e)   denote the demand set. Then: D(>p,p,e) = {x: px p x' for all affordable bundles x'.
