   7alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase      7alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 7alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholanate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3alpha,12alpha-dihydroxy-7-oxo-5beta-cholanate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholanate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 3alpha,12alpha-dihydroxy-7-oxo-5beta-cholanate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 7alpha-hydroxysteroid:NAD + 7-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 7alpha-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase , and 7alpha-HSDH .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
