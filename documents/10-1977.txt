   Hydroxypyruvate decarboxylase      Hydroxypyruvate decarboxylase   In enzymology , a hydroxypyruvate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   hydroxypyruvate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycolaldehyde + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , hydroxypyruvate , and two products , glycolaldehyde and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hydroxypyruvate carboxy-lyase (glycolaldehyde-forming) . This enzyme is also called hydroxypyruvate carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 4.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
