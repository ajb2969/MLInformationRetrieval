Draft:Behrend's formula

== Formulation == By definition, if C is a category in which morphisms are isomorphisms, the number of points in 
 
 
 
  is denoted by


 
  with the sum running over objects p. (The series may diverge in general.) The formula states: for a smooth algebraic stack X over the finite field 
 
 
 
  and the "arithmetic" Frobenius

 
  (i.e., the inverse of the Frobenius in Grothendieck's formula),



The Siegel mass formula computes the left-hand side:1 if G is a semisimple group with tamagawa number

 
 ,
