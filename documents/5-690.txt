   Root test      Root test   In mathematics , the root test is a criterion for the convergence (a convergence test ) of an infinite series . It depends on the quantity        lim sup   n  →  ∞      |   a  n   |   n    ,      subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n        n      subscript  a  n       \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sqrt[n]{|a_{n}|},   where    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   are the terms of the series, and states that the series converges absolutely if this quantity is less than one but diverges if it is greater than one. It is particularly useful in connection with power series .  Test  The root test was developed first by Augustin-Louis Cauchy and so is sometimes known as the Cauchy root test or Cauchy's radical test . For a series        ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n    .      superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}.     the root test uses the number       C  =    lim sup   n  →  ∞      |   a  n   |   n     ,      C    subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n        n      subscript  a  n        C=\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sqrt[n]{|a_{n}|},     where "lim sup" denotes the limit superior , possibly ∞. Note that if        lim   n  →  ∞      |   a  n   |   n    ,      subscript    normal-→  n        n      subscript  a  n       \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sqrt[n]{|a_{n}|},     converges then it equals C and may be used in the root test instead.  The root test states that:   if C < 1 then the series converges absolutely ,  if C > 1 then the series diverges ,  if C = 1 and the limit approaches strictly from above then the series diverges,  otherwise the test is inconclusive (the series may diverge, converge absolutely or converge conditionally ).   There are some series for which C = 1 and the series converges, e.g.    ∑   1  /   n  2          1   superscript  n  2      \textstyle\sum 1/{n^{2}}   , and there are others for which C = 1 and the series diverges, e.g.    ∑   1  /  n         1  n     \textstyle\sum 1/n   .  Application to power series  This test can be used with a power series       f   (  z  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     c  n     (   z  -  p   )   n           f  z     superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  c  n    superscript    z  p   n       f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n}(z-p)^{n}     where the coefficients c n , and the center p are complex numbers and the argument z is a complex variable.  The terms of this series would then be given by a n = c n ( z − p ) n . One then applies the root test to the a n as above. Note that sometimes a series like this is called a power series "around p ", because the radius of convergence is the radius R of the largest interval or disc centred at p such that the series will converge for all points z strictly in the interior (convergence on the boundary of the interval or disc generally has to be checked separately). A corollary of the root test applied to such a power series is that the radius of convergence is exactly     1  /    lim sup   n  →  ∞      |   c  n   |   n     ,      1    subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n        n      subscript  c  n        1/\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}{\sqrt[n]{|c_{n}|}},   taking care that we really mean ∞ if the denominator is 0.  Proof  The proof of the convergence of a series Σ a n is an application of the comparison test . If for all n ≥ N ( N some fixed natural number ) we have       a  n   n   <  k  <  1   ,           n    subscript  a  n    k       1     \sqrt[n]{a_{n}}   then     a  n   <   k  n   <  1.         subscript  a  n    superscript  k  n        1.     a_{n}   Since the geometric series      ∑   n  =  N   ∞    k  n       superscript   subscript     n  N       superscript  k  n     \sum_{n=N}^{\infty}k^{n}   converges so does     ∑   n  =  N   ∞    a  n       superscript   subscript     n  N       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=N}^{\infty}a_{n}   by the comparison test. Absolute convergence in the case of nonpositive a n can be proven in exactly the same way using      |   a  n   |   n   .       n      subscript  a  n      \sqrt[n]{|a_{n}|}.     If      |   a  n   |   n   >  1         n      subscript  a  n     1    \sqrt[n]{|a_{n}|}>1   for infinitely many n , then a n fails to converge to 0, hence the series is divergent.  Proof of corollary : For a power series Σ a n = Σ c n ( z − p ) n , we see by the above that the series converges if there exists an N such that for all n ≥ N we have         |   a  n   |   n   =    |    c  n     (   z  -  p   )   n    |   n   <  1   ,           n      subscript  a  n        n        subscript  c  n    superscript    z  p   n           1     \sqrt[n]{|a_{n}|}=\sqrt[n]{|c_{n}(z-p)^{n}|}<1,     equivalent to         |   c  n   |   n   ⋅   |   z  -  p   |    <  1       normal-⋅     n      subscript  c  n         z  p     1    \sqrt[n]{|c_{n}|}\cdot|z-p|<1     for all n ≥ N , which implies that in order for the series to converge we must have     |   z  -  p   |   <   1  /    |   c  n   |   n            z  p      1     n      subscript  c  n        |z-p|<1/\sqrt[n]{|c_{n}|}   for all sufficiently large n . This is equivalent to saying        |   z  -  p   |   <   1  /    lim sup   n  →  ∞      |   c  n   |   n      ,          z  p      1    subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n        n      subscript  c  n         |z-p|<1/\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}{\sqrt[n]{|c_{n}|}},     so     R  ≤   1  /    lim sup   n  →  ∞      |   c  n   |   n      .      R    1    subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n        n      subscript  c  n         R\leq 1/\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}{\sqrt[n]{|c_{n}|}}.   Now the only other place where convergence is possible is when         |   a  n   |   n   =    |    c  n     (   z  -  p   )   n    |   n   =  1   ,           n      subscript  a  n        n        subscript  c  n    superscript    z  p   n           1     \sqrt[n]{|a_{n}|}=\sqrt[n]{|c_{n}(z-p)^{n}|}=1,     (since points > 1 will diverge) and this will not change the radius of convergence since these are just the points lying on the boundary of the interval or disc, so       R  =   1  /    lim sup   n  →  ∞      |   c  n   |   n      .      R    1    subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n        n      subscript  c  n         R=1/\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}{\sqrt[n]{|c_{n}|}}.
