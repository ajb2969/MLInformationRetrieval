Khintchine inequality

In mathematics, the Khintchine inequality, named after Aleksandr Khinchin and spelled in multiple ways in the Roman alphabet, is a theorem from probability, and is also frequently used in analysis. Heuristically, it says that if we pick 
 
 
complex numbers

 
 , and add them together each multiplied by a random sign 
 
 
 
 , then the expected value of its modulus, or the modulus it will be closest to on average, will be not too far off from 
 
 
 
 .
Statement of theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be i.i.d. random variables with 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
 , i.e., a sequence with Rademacher distribution. Let 
 
 
 
 . Then



for some constants 
 
 
 
  depending only on 
 
 
 
  (see Expected value for notation). The sharp values of the constants 
 
 
 
  were found by Haagerup (Ref. 2; see Ref. 3 for a simpler proof). It is a simple matter to see that 
 
 
 
  when 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  when 
 
 
 
 .
Uses in analysis
The uses of this inequality are not limited to applications in probability theory. One example of its use in analysis is the following: if we let 
 
 
 
  be a linear operator between two Lp spaces

 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , with bounded norm

 
 , then one can use Khintchine's inequality to show that



for some constant 
 
 
 
  depending only on 
 
 
 
  and $\|T\|$.
