   Continuous stochastic process      Continuous stochastic process   In probability theory , a continuous stochastic process is a type of stochastic process that may be said to be " continuous " as a function of its "time" or index parameter. Continuity is a nice property for (the sample paths of) a process to have, since it implies that they are well-behaved in some sense, and, therefore, much easier to analyze. It is implicit here that the index of the stochastic process is a continuous variable. Note that some authors 1 define a "continuous (stochastic) process" as only requiring that the index variable be continuous, without continuity of sample paths: in some terminology, this would be a continuous-time stochastic process , in parallel to a "discrete-time process". Given the possible confusion, caution is needed. 2  Definitions  Let (Ω, Σ, P ) be a probability space , let T be some interval of time, and let X : T × Ω → S be a stochastic process. For simplicity, the rest of this article will take the state space S to be the real line  R , but the definitions go through mutatis mutandis if S is R n , a normed vector space , or even a general metric space .  Continuity with probability one  Given a time t ∈ T , X is said to be continuous with probability one at t if       𝐏   (   {   ω  ∈  Ω   |     lim   s  →  t     |     X  s    (  ω  )    -    X  t    (  ω  )     |    =  0   }   )    =  1.        𝐏   conditional-set    ω  normal-Ω       subscript    normal-→  s  t           subscript  X  s   ω      subscript  X  t   ω      0     1.    \mathbf{P}\left(\left\{\omega\in\Omega\left|\lim_{s\to t}\big|X_{s}(\omega)-X_%
 {t}(\omega)\big|=0\right.\right\}\right)=1.     Mean-square continuity  Given a time t ∈ T , X is said to be continuous in mean-square at t if E [| X t | 2 ] \lim_{s \to t} \mathbf{E} \left[ \big| X_{s} - X_{t} \big|^{2} \right] = 0.  Continuity in probability  Given a time t ∈ T , X is said to be continuous in probability at t if, for all ε > 0,        lim   s  →  t     𝐏   (   {   ω  ∈  Ω   |    |     X  s    (  ω  )    -    X  t    (  ω  )     |   ≥  ε   }   )     =  0.        subscript    normal-→  s  t      𝐏   conditional-set    ω  normal-Ω            subscript  X  s   ω      subscript  X  t   ω     ε      0.    \lim_{s\to t}\mathbf{P}\left(\left\{\omega\in\Omega\left|\big|X_{s}(\omega)-X_%
 {t}(\omega)\big|\geq\varepsilon\right.\right\}\right)=0.     Equivalently, X is continuous in probability at time t if        lim   s  →  t     𝐄   [    |    X  s   -   X  t    |    1  +   |    X  s   -   X  t    |     ]     =  0.        subscript    normal-→  s  t      𝐄   delimited-[]         subscript  X  s    subscript  X  t       1       subscript  X  s    subscript  X  t          0.    \lim_{s\to t}\mathbf{E}\left[\frac{\big|X_{s}-X_{t}\big|}{1+\big|X_{s}-X_{t}%
 \big|}\right]=0.     Continuity in distribution  Given a time t ∈ T , X is said to be continuous in distribution at t if        lim   s  →  t      F  s    (  x  )     =    F  t    (  x  )          subscript    normal-→  s  t       subscript  F  s   x       subscript  F  t   x     \lim_{s\to t}F_{s}(x)=F_{t}(x)     for all points x at which F t is continuous, where F t denotes the cumulative distribution function of the random variable  X t .  Sample continuity  X is said to be sample continuous if X t ( ω ) is continuous in t for P - almost all  ω ∈ Ω. Sample continuity is the appropriate notion of continuity for processes such as Itō diffusions .  Feller continuity  X is said to be a Feller-continuous process if, for any fixed t ∈ T and any bounded , continuous and Σ- measurable function  g : S → R , E x [ g ( X t )] depends continuously upon x . Here x denotes the initial state of the process X , and E x denotes expectation conditional upon the event that X starts at x .  Relationships  The relationships between the various types of continuity of stochastic processes are akin to the relationships between the various types of convergence of random variables . In particular:   continuity with probability one implies continuity in probability;  continuity in mean-square implies continuity in probability;  continuity with probability one neither implies, nor is implied by, continuity in mean-square;  continuity in probability implies, but is not implied by, continuity in distribution.   It is tempting to confuse continuity with probability one with sample continuity. Continuity with probability one at time t means that P ( A t ) = 0, where the event A t is given by        A  t   =   {   ω  ∈  Ω   |     lim   s  →  t     |     X  s    (  ω  )    -    X  t    (  ω  )     |    ≠  0   }    ,       subscript  A  t    conditional-set    ω  normal-Ω       subscript    normal-→  s  t           subscript  X  s   ω      subscript  X  t   ω      0      A_{t}=\left\{\omega\in\Omega\left|\lim_{s\to t}\big|X_{s}(\omega)-X_{t}(\omega%
 )\big|\neq 0\right.\right\},     and it is perfectly feasible to check whether or not this holds for each t ∈ T . Sample continuity, on the other hand, requires that P ( A ) = 0, where       A  =    ⋃   t  ∈  T     A  t     .      A    subscript     t  T     subscript  A  t      A=\bigcup_{t\in T}A_{t}.     Note that A is an uncountable  union of events, so it may not actually be an event itself, so P ( A ) may be undefined! Even worse, even if A is an event, P ( A ) can be strictly positive even if P ( A t ) = 0 for every t ∈ T . This is the case, for example, with the telegraph process .
