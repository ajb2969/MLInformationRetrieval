Rhenium-osmium dating
'''Rhenium-Osmium dating''' is a form of [[radiometric dating]] based on the [[beta decay]] of the [[isotope]] 187[[rhenium|Re]] to 187[[Osmium|Os]].  This normally occurs with a [[half-life]] of 41.6 × 109 y,{{cite journal | last1=Smoliar | first1=M.I. | last2=Walker | first2=R.J. | last3=Morgan | first3=J.W. | year=1996 | title=Re-Os ages of group IIA, IIIA, IVA, and IVB iron meteorites | journal=Science | volume=271 | pages=1099–1102| doi = 10.1126/science.271.5252.1099 | issue=5252 | bibcode=1996Sci...271.1099S}} but studies using fully ionised 187[[rhenium|Re]] atoms have found that this can decrease to only 33 y.{{cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.5190 | title = Observation of bound-state β– decay of fully ionized 187Re:187Re-187Os Cosmochronometry | last1=Bosch | first1=F. | year = 1996 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 77 | issue = 26 | pages = 5190–519

This dating method is based on an isochron calculated based on isotopic ratios measured using N-TIMS (Negative – Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry).
Rhenium-Osmium isochron
Rhenium-Osmium dating is carried out by the isochron dating method. Isochrons are created by analysing several samples believed to have formed at the same time from a common source. The Re-Os isochron plots the ratio of radiogenic 187Os to non-radiogenic 188Os against the ratio of the parent isotope 187Re to the non-radiogenic isotope 188Os. The stable and relatively abundant osmium isotope 188Os is used to normalize the radiogenic isotope in the isochron.
The Re-Os isochron is defined by the following equation:



where:

t is the age of the sample,
 
λ is the decay constant of 187Re,
 
(eλt-1) is the slope of the isochron which defines the age of the system.
 

A good example of an application of the Re-Os isochron method is a study on the dating of a gold deposit in the Witwatersrand mining camp, South Africa.1
