Lewin's equation

Lewin's equation, B = f(P, E), is not actually a mathematical equation representing quantifiable relationships but rather a heuristic formula designed by psychologist Kurt Lewin.
Description
The formula states that behavior is a function of the person and his or her environment:1





Where 
 
 
 
  is behavior, 
 
 
 
  is Person, and 
 
 
 
  is the environment.
The equation is the psychologist's most well known formula in social psychology, of which Lewin was a modern pioneer. When first presented in Lewin's book Principles of Topological Psychology, published in 1936, it contradicted most popular theories in that it gave importance to a person's momentary situation in understanding his or her behavior, rather than relying entirely on the past.2
