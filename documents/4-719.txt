   Spectral sequence      Spectral sequence   In homological algebra and algebraic topology , a spectral sequence is a means of computing homology groups by taking successive approximations. Spectral sequences are a generalization of exact sequences , and since their introduction by , they have become important computational tools, particularly in algebraic topology , algebraic geometry and homological algebra .  Discovery and motivation  Motivated by problems in algebraic topology , Jean Leray introduced the notion of a sheaf and found himself faced with the problem of computing sheaf cohomology . To compute sheaf cohomology, Leray introduced a computational technique now known as the Leray spectral sequence . This gave a relation between cohomology groups of a sheaf and cohomology groups of the pushforward of the sheaf . The relation involved an infinite process. Leray found that the cohomology groups of the pushforward formed a natural chain complex , so that he could take the cohomology of the cohomology. This was still not the cohomology of the original sheaf, but it was one step closer in a sense. The cohomology of the cohomology again formed a chain complex, and its cohomology formed a chain complex, and so on. The limit of this infinite process was essentially the same as the cohomology groups of the original sheaf.  It was soon realized that Leray's computational technique was an example of a more general phenomenon. Spectral sequences were found in diverse situations, and they gave intricate relationships among homology and cohomology groups coming from geometric situations such as fibrations and from algebraic situations involving derived functors . While their theoretical importance has decreased since the introduction of derived categories , they are still the most effective computational tool available. This is true even when many of the terms of the spectral sequence are incalculable.  Unfortunately, because of the large amount of information carried in spectral sequences, they are difficult to grasp. This information is usually contained in a rank three lattice of abelian groups or modules . The easiest cases to deal with are those in which the spectral sequence eventually collapses, meaning that going out further in the sequence produces no new information. Even when this does not happen, it is often possible to get useful information from a spectral sequence by various tricks.  Formal definition  Fix an abelian category , such as a category of modules over a ring . A spectral sequence is a choice of a nonnegative integer r 0 and a collection of three sequences:   For all integers r ≥ r 0 , an object E r , called a sheet (as in a sheet of paper ), or sometimes a page or a term ,  Endomorphisms d r : E r → E r satisfying d r  o  d r = 0, called boundary maps or differentials ,  Isomorphisms of E r+1 with H ( E r ), the homology of E r with respect to d r .   Usually the isomorphisms between E r +1 and H ( E r ) are suppressed, and we write equalities instead. Sometimes E r +1 is called the derived object of E r .  The most elementary example is a chain complex  C • . An object C • in an abelian category of chain complexes comes with a differential d . Let r 0 = 0, and let E 0 be C • . This forces E 1 to be the complex H ( C • ): At the i 'th location this is the i 'th homology group of C • . The only natural differential on this new complex is the zero map, so we let d 1 = 0. This forces E 2 to equal E 1 , and again our only natural differential is the zero map. Putting the zero differential on all the rest of our sheets gives a spectral sequence whose terms are:   E 0 = C •  E r = H ( C • ) for all r ≥ 1.   The terms of this spectral sequence stabilize at the first sheet because its only nontrivial differential was on the zeroth sheet. Consequently, we can get no more information at later steps. Usually, to get useful information from later sheets, we need extra structure on the E r .  In the ungraded situation described above, r 0 is irrelevant, but in practice most spectral sequences occur in the category of doubly graded modules over a ring  R (or doubly graded sheaves of modules over a sheaf of rings). In this case, each sheet is a doubly graded module, so it decomposes as a direct sum of terms with one term for each possible bidegree. The boundary map is defined as the direct sum of boundary maps on each of the terms of the sheet. Their degree depends on r and is fixed by convention. For a homological spectral sequence, the terms are written    E   p  ,  q   r     subscript   superscript  E  r    p  q     E^{r}_{p,q}   and the differentials have bidegree (− r , r − 1). For a cohomological spectral sequence, the terms are written    E  r   p  ,  q      subscript   superscript  E   p  q    r    E^{p,q}_{r}   and the differentials have bidegree ( r , 1 − r ). (These choices of bidegree occur naturally in practice; see the example of a double complex below.) Depending upon the spectral sequence, the boundary map on the first sheet can have a degree which corresponds to r = 0, r = 1, or r = 2. For example, for the spectral sequence of a filtered complex, described below, r 0 = 0, but for the Grothendieck spectral sequence , r 0 = 2. Usually r 0 is zero, one, or two.  A morphism of spectral sequences E → ''E' '' is by definition a collection of maps f r : E r → E' r which are compatible with the differentials and with the given isomorphisms between cohomology of the r -th step and the ( r + 1)-st sheets of E and ''E' '', respectively.  Let E r be a spectral sequence, starting with say r = 0. Then there is a sequence of subobjects      0  =   B  0   ⊂   B  1   ⊂   B  2   ⊂  …  ⊂   B  r   ⊂  …  ⊂   Z  r   ⊂  …  ⊂   Z  2   ⊂   Z  1   ⊂   Z  0   =   E  0         0   subscript  B  0         subscript  B  1         subscript  B  2        normal-…        subscript  B  r        normal-…        subscript  Z  r        normal-…        subscript  Z  2         subscript  Z  1         subscript  Z  0         subscript  E  0      0=B_{0}\subset B_{1}\subset B_{2}\subset\dots\subset B_{r}\subset\dots\subset Z%
 _{r}\subset\dots\subset Z_{2}\subset Z_{1}\subset Z_{0}=E_{0}   such that     E  r   ≃    Z   r  -  1    /   B   r  -  1        similar-to-or-equals   subscript  E  r      subscript  Z    r  1     subscript  B    r  1       E_{r}\simeq Z_{r-1}/B_{r-1}   ; indeed, recursively we let      Z  0   =   E  0    ,    B  0   =  0      formulae-sequence     subscript  Z  0    subscript  E  0       subscript  B  0   0     Z_{0}=E_{0},B_{0}=0   and let     Z  r   ,   B  r       subscript  Z  r    subscript  B  r     Z_{r},B_{r}   be so that      Z  r   /   B   r  -  1     ,    B  r   /   B   r  -  1           subscript  Z  r    subscript  B    r  1        subscript  B  r    subscript  B    r  1       Z_{r}/B_{r-1},B_{r}/B_{r-1}   are the kernel and the image of      E  r    →   d  r     E  r    .       subscript  E  r     subscript  d  r   normal-→    subscript  E  r     E_{r}\overset{d_{r}}{\to}E_{r}.     We then let      Z  ∞   =    ∩  r    Z  r     ,    B  ∞   =    ∪  r    B  r        formulae-sequence     subscript  Z      subscript   r    subscript  Z  r        subscript  B      subscript   r    subscript  B  r       Z_{\infty}=\cap_{r}Z_{r},B_{\infty}=\cup_{r}B_{r}   and       E  ∞   =    Z  ∞   /   B  ∞         subscript  E       subscript  Z     subscript  B       E_{\infty}=Z_{\infty}/B_{\infty}   ; it is called the limiting term. (Of course, such    E  ∞     subscript  E     E_{\infty}   need not exist in the category, but this is usually a non-issue since for example in the category of modules such limits exist or since in practice a spectral sequence one works with tends to degenerates; there are only finitely many inclusions in the sequence above.)  Visualization  A doubly graded spectral sequence has a tremendous amount of data to keep track of, but there is a common visualization technique which makes the structure of the spectral sequence clearer. We have three indices, r , p , and q . For each r , imagine that we have a sheet of graph paper. On this sheet, we will take p to be the horizontal direction and q to be the vertical direction. At each lattice point we have the object    E  r   p  ,  q      superscript   subscript  E  r    p  q     E_{r}^{p,q}   .  It is very common for n = p + q to be another natural index in the spectral sequence. n runs diagonally, northwest to southeast, across each sheet. In the homological case, the differentials have bidegree (− r , r − 1), so they decrease n by one. In the cohomological case, n is increased by one. When r is zero, the differential moves objects one space down or up. This is similar to the differential on a chain complex. When r is one, the differential moves objects one space to the left or right. When r is two, the differential moves objects just like a knight 's move in chess . For higher r , the differential acts like a generalized knight's move.  Worked-out examples  When learning spectral sequences for the first time, it is often helpful to work with simple computational examples. For more formal and complete discussions, see the sections below. For the examples in this section, it suffices to use this definition: one says a spectral sequence converges to H with an increasing filtration F if     E   p  ,  q   ∞   =      F  p    H   p  +  q     /   F   p  -  1      H   p  +  q          subscript   superscript  E     p  q           subscript  F  p    subscript  H    p  q      subscript  F    p  1      subscript  H    p  q       E^{\infty}_{p,q}=F_{p}H_{p+q}/F_{p-1}H_{p+q}   . The examples below illustrate how one relates such filtrations with the E 2 -term in the forms of exact sequences; many exact sequences in applications (e.g., Gysin sequence ) arise in this fashion.  2 columns and 2 rows  Let    E   p  ,  q   r     subscript   superscript  E  r    p  q     E^{r}_{p,q}   be a spectral sequence such that     E   p  ,  q   2   =  0       subscript   superscript  E  2    p  q    0    E^{2}_{p,q}=0   for all p other than 0, 1. The differentials on the second page have degree (-2, 1) and therefore they are all zero; i.e., the spectral sequence degenerates     E  ∞   =   E  2        superscript  E     superscript  E  2     E^{\infty}=E^{2}   . Say, it converges to H with a filtration      0  =    F   -  1     H  n    ⊂    F  0    H  n    ⊂  …  ⊂    F  n    H  n    =   H  n         0     subscript  F    1     subscript  H  n            subscript  F  0    subscript  H  n         normal-…          subscript  F  n    subscript  H  n          subscript  H  n      0=F_{-1}H_{n}\subset F_{0}H_{n}\subset\dots\subset F_{n}H_{n}=H_{n}   such that     E   p  ,  q   ∞   =      F  p    H   p  +  q     /   F   p  -  1      H   p  +  q          subscript   superscript  E     p  q           subscript  F  p    subscript  H    p  q      subscript  F    p  1      subscript  H    p  q       E^{\infty}_{p,q}=F_{p}H_{p+q}/F_{p-1}H_{p+q}   . Then      F  0    H  n    =   E   0  ,  n   2          subscript  F  0    subscript  H  n     subscript   superscript  E  2    0  n      F_{0}H_{n}=E^{2}_{0,n}   ,        F  1    H  n    /   F  0     H  n    =   E   1  ,   n  -  1    2              subscript  F  1    subscript  H  n     subscript  F  0     subscript  H  n     subscript   superscript  E  2    1    n  1       F_{1}H_{n}/F_{0}H_{n}=E^{2}_{1,n-1}   ,        F  2    H  n    /   F  1     H  n    =  0             subscript  F  2    subscript  H  n     subscript  F  1     subscript  H  n    0    F_{2}H_{n}/F_{1}H_{n}=0   ,        F  3    H  n    /   F  2     H  n    =  0             subscript  F  3    subscript  H  n     subscript  F  2     subscript  H  n    0    F_{3}H_{n}/F_{2}H_{n}=0   , etc. Thus, there is the exact sequence: 1      0  →   E   0  ,  n   2   →   H  n   →   E   1  ,   n  -  1    2   →  0       normal-→  0   subscript   superscript  E  2    0  n      normal-→     subscript  H  n     normal-→     subscript   superscript  E  2    1    n  1       normal-→    0     0\to E^{2}_{0,n}\to H_{n}\to E^{2}_{1,n-1}\to 0   .  Next, let    E   p  ,  q   r     subscript   superscript  E  r    p  q     E^{r}_{p,q}   be a spectral sequence whose second page consists only of two lines q = 0, 1. This need not degenerate at the second page but it still degenerates at the third page as the differentials there have degree (-3, 2). Note     E   p  ,  0   3   =   ker   (   d  :    E   p  ,  0   2   →   E    p  -  2   ,  1   2     )         subscript   superscript  E  3    p  0     ker   normal-:  d   normal-→   subscript   superscript  E  2    p  0     subscript   superscript  E  2      p  2   1         E^{3}_{p,0}=\operatorname{ker}(d:E^{2}_{p,0}\to E^{2}_{p-2,1})   , as the denominator is zero. Similarly,     E   p  ,  1   3   =   coker   (   d  :    E    p  +  2   ,  0   2   →   E   p  ,  1   2     )         subscript   superscript  E  3    p  1     coker   normal-:  d   normal-→   subscript   superscript  E  2      p  2   0     subscript   superscript  E  2    p  1         E^{3}_{p,1}=\operatorname{coker}(d:E^{2}_{p+2,0}\to E^{2}_{p,1})   . Thus,      0  →   E   p  ,  0   ∞   →    E   p  ,  0   2    →  𝑑    E    p  -  2   ,  1   2    →   E    p  -  2   ,  1   ∞   →  0       normal-→  0   subscript   superscript  E     p  0      normal-→       subscript   superscript  E  2    p  0     d  normal-→    subscript   superscript  E  2      p  2   1       normal-→     subscript   superscript  E       p  2   1      normal-→    0     0\to E^{\infty}_{p,0}\to E^{2}_{p,0}\overset{d}{\to}E^{2}_{p-2,1}\to E^{\infty%
 }_{p-2,1}\to 0   . Now, say, the spectral sequence converges to H with a filtration F as in the previous example. Since        F   p  -  2     H  p    /   F   p  -  3      H  p    =   E    p  -  2   ,  2   ∞   =  0               subscript  F    p  2     subscript  H  p     subscript  F    p  3      subscript  H  p     subscript   superscript  E       p  2   2         0     F_{p-2}H_{p}/F_{p-3}H_{p}=E^{\infty}_{p-2,2}=0   ,        F   p  -  3     H  p    /   F   p  -  4      H  p    =  0             subscript  F    p  3     subscript  H  p     subscript  F    p  4      subscript  H  p    0    F_{p-3}H_{p}/F_{p-4}H_{p}=0   , etc., we have    0  →   E    p  -  1   ,  1   ∞   →   H  p   →   E   p  ,  0   ∞   →  0       normal-→  0   subscript   superscript  E       p  1   1      normal-→     subscript  H  p     normal-→     subscript   superscript  E     p  0      normal-→    0     0\to E^{\infty}_{p-1,1}\to H_{p}\to E^{\infty}_{p,0}\to 0   . Putting everything together, one gets: 2       ⋯  →   H   p  +  1    →    E    p  +  1   ,  0   2    →  𝑑    E    p  -  1   ,  1   2    →   H  p   →    E   p  ,  0   2    →  𝑑    E    p  -  2   ,  1   2    →   H   p  -  1    →  …   .       normal-→  normal-⋯   subscript  H    p  1      normal-→       subscript   superscript  E  2      p  1   0     d  normal-→    subscript   superscript  E  2      p  1   1       normal-→     subscript  H  p     normal-→       subscript   superscript  E  2    p  0     d  normal-→    subscript   superscript  E  2      p  2   1       normal-→     subscript  H    p  1      normal-→    normal-…     \cdots\to H_{p+1}\to E^{2}_{p+1,0}\overset{d}{\to}E^{2}_{p-1,1}\to H_{p}\to E^%
 {2}_{p,0}\overset{d}{\to}E^{2}_{p-2,1}\to H_{p-1}\to\dots.     Wang sequence  The computation in the previous section generalizes in a straightforward way. Consider a fibration over a sphere:      F   →  𝑖   E   →  𝑝    S  n       F   i  normal-→   E   p  normal-→    superscript  S  n     F\overset{i}{\to}E\overset{p}{\to}S^{n}   with n at least 2. There is the Serre spectral sequence :       E   p  ,  q   2   =    H  p    (   S  n   ;    H  q    (  F  )    )    ⇒    H   p  +  q     (  E  )           subscript   superscript  E  2    p  q       subscript  H  p     superscript  S  n      subscript  H  q   F       normal-⇒       subscript  H    p  q    E      E^{2}_{p,q}=H_{p}(S^{n};H_{q}(F))\Rightarrow H_{p+q}(E)   ; that is to say,     E   p  ,  q   ∞   =      F  p    H   p  +  q     (  E  )    /   F   p  -  1      H   p  +  q     (  E  )         subscript   superscript  E     p  q           subscript  F  p    subscript  H    p  q    E    subscript  F    p  1      subscript  H    p  q    E     E^{\infty}_{p,q}=F_{p}H_{p+q}(E)/F_{p-1}H_{p+q}(E)   with some filtration F .  Since     H  p    (   S  n   )        subscript  H  p    superscript  S  n     H_{p}(S^{n})   is nonzero only when p is zero or n and equal to Z in that case, we see    E   p  ,  q   2     subscript   superscript  E  2    p  q     E^{2}_{p,q}   consists of only two lines p = 0, n and moreover     E   p  ,  q   2   =    H  q    (  F  )         subscript   superscript  E  2    p  q       subscript  H  q   F     E^{2}_{p,q}=H_{q}(F)   for p = 0, n , by the universal coefficient theorem .

Low-degree terms  With an obvious notational change, the type of the computations in the previous examples can also be carried out for cohomological spectral sequence. Let    E  r   p  ,  q      superscript   subscript  E  r    p  q     E_{r}^{p,q}   be a first-quadrant spectral sequence converging to H with the decreasing filtration      0  =    F   n  +  1     H  n    ⊂    F  n    H  n    ⊂  …  ⊂    F  0    H  n    =   H  n         0     superscript  F    n  1     superscript  H  n            superscript  F  n    superscript  H  n         normal-…          superscript  F  0    superscript  H  n          superscript  H  n      0=F^{n+1}H^{n}\subset F^{n}H^{n}\subset\dots\subset F^{0}H^{n}=H^{n}   so that      E  ∞   p  ,  q    =      F  p    H   p  +  q     /   F   p  +  1      H   p  +  q      .       superscript   subscript  E     p  q           superscript  F  p    superscript  H    p  q      superscript  F    p  1      superscript  H    p  q       E_{\infty}^{p,q}=F^{p}H^{p+q}/F^{p+1}H^{p+q}.   Since    E   p  ,  q   2     subscript   superscript  E  2    p  q     E^{2}_{p,q}   is zero if p or q is negative, we have:      0  →   E  ∞   0  ,  1    →    E  2   0  ,  1     →  𝑑    E  2   2  ,  0     →   E  ∞   2  ,  0    →  0.       normal-→  0   subscript   superscript  E   0  1        normal-→       subscript   superscript  E   0  1    2    d  normal-→    subscript   superscript  E   2  0    2      normal-→     subscript   superscript  E   2  0        normal-→    0.     0\to E^{0,1}_{\infty}\to E^{0,1}_{2}\overset{d}{\to}E^{2,0}_{2}\to E^{2,0}_{%
 \infty}\to 0.   Since     E  ∞   1  ,  0    =   E  2   1  ,  0         superscript   subscript  E     1  0     superscript   subscript  E  2    1  0      E_{\infty}^{1,0}=E_{2}^{1,0}   for the same reason and since       F  2    H  1    =  0   ,         superscript  F  2    superscript  H  1    0    F^{2}H^{1}=0,         0  →   E  2   1  ,  0    →   H  1   →   E  ∞   0  ,  1    →  0       normal-→  0   superscript   subscript  E  2    1  0      normal-→     superscript  H  1     normal-→     subscript   superscript  E   0  1        normal-→    0     0\to E_{2}^{1,0}\to H^{1}\to E^{0,1}_{\infty}\to 0   . Since      F  3    H  2    =  0         superscript  F  3    superscript  H  2    0    F^{3}H^{2}=0   ,     E  ∞   2  ,  0    ⊂   H  2        subscript   superscript  E   2  0       superscript  H  2     E^{2,0}_{\infty}\subset H^{2}   . Stacking the sequences together, we get the so-called five-term exact sequence :       0  →   E  2   1  ,  0    →   H  1   →    E  2   0  ,  1     →  𝑑    E  2   2  ,  0     →   H  2    .       normal-→  0   subscript   superscript  E   1  0    2     normal-→     superscript  H  1     normal-→       subscript   superscript  E   0  1    2    d  normal-→    subscript   superscript  E   2  0    2      normal-→     superscript  H  2      0\to E^{1,0}_{2}\to H^{1}\to E^{0,1}_{2}\overset{d}{\to}E^{2,0}_{2}\to H^{2}.     Edge maps and transgressions  Let    E   p  ,  q   r     subscript   superscript  E  r    p  q     E^{r}_{p,q}   be a spectral sequence. If     E   p  ,  q   r   =  0       subscript   superscript  E  r    p  q    0    E^{r}_{p,q}=0   for every q E^{r+1}_{p, 0} = \operatorname{ker}(d: E^r_{p, 0} \to E^r_{p-r, r-1}) as the denominator is zero. Hence, there is a sequence of monomorphisms:       E   p  ,  0   r   →   E   p  ,  0    r  -  1    →  …  →   E   p  ,  0   3   →   E   p  ,  0   2        normal-→   subscript   superscript  E  r    p  0     subscript   superscript  E    r  1     p  0      normal-→    normal-…    normal-→     subscript   superscript  E  3    p  0      normal-→     subscript   superscript  E  2    p  0       E^{r}_{p,0}\to E^{r-1}_{p,0}\to\dots\to E^{3}_{p,0}\to E^{2}_{p,0}   . They are called the edge maps. Similarly, if     E   p  ,  q   r   =  0       subscript   superscript  E  r    p  q    0    E^{r}_{p,q}=0   for every p E^2_{0, q} \to E^3_{0, q} \to \dots \to E^{r-1}_{0, q} \to E^r_{0, q}. The transgression is a partially-defined map (more precisely, a map from a subobject to a quotient )      τ  :    E   p  ,  0   2   →   E   0  ,   p  -  1    2       normal-:  τ   normal-→   subscript   superscript  E  2    p  0     subscript   superscript  E  2    0    p  1        \tau:E^{2}_{p,0}\to E^{2}_{0,p-1}   given as a composition     E   p  ,  0   2   →    E   p  ,  0   p    →  𝑑    E   0  ,   p  -  1    p    →   E   0  ,   p  -  1    2        normal-→   subscript   superscript  E  2    p  0       subscript   superscript  E  p    p  0     d  normal-→    subscript   superscript  E  p    0    p  1        normal-→     subscript   superscript  E  2    0    p  1        E^{2}_{p,0}\to E^{p}_{p,0}\overset{d}{\to}E^{p}_{0,p-1}\to E^{2}_{0,p-1}   , the first and last maps being the inverses of the edge maps. 4  For a spectral sequence    E  r   p  ,  q      superscript   subscript  E  r    p  q     E_{r}^{p,q}   of cohomological type, the analogous statements hold. If     E   p  ,  q   r   =  0       subscript   superscript  E  r    p  q    0    E^{r}_{p,q}=0   for every q E_{2}^{p, 0} \to E_{3}^{p, 0} \to \dots \to E_{r-1}^{p, 0} \to E_r^{p, 0}. and if     E   p  ,  q   r   =  0       subscript   superscript  E  r    p  q    0    E^{r}_{p,q}=0   for every p E_{r}^{0, q} \to E_{r-1}^{0, q} \to \dots \to E_{3}^{0, q} \to E_2^{0, q}. The transgression is a not necessarily well-defined map:      τ  :    E  2   0  ,   q  -  1     →   E  2   q  ,  0        normal-:  τ   normal-→   superscript   subscript  E  2    0    q  1      superscript   subscript  E  2    q  0       \tau:E_{2}^{0,q-1}\to E_{2}^{q,0}   induced by    d  :    E  q   0  ,   q  -  1     →   E  q   q  ,  0        normal-:  d   normal-→   superscript   subscript  E  q    0    q  1      superscript   subscript  E  q    q  0       d:E_{q}^{0,q-1}\to E_{q}^{q,0}   .  Multiplicative structure  A cup product gives a ring structure to a cohomology group, turning it into a cohomology ring . Thus, it is natural to consider a spectral sequence with a ring structure as well. Let    E  r   p  ,  q      subscript   superscript  E   p  q    r    E^{p,q}_{r}   be a spectral sequence of cohomological type. We say it has multiplicative structure if (i)    E  r     subscript  E  r    E_{r}   are (doubly graded) differential graded algebras and (ii) the multiplication on    E   r  +  1      subscript  E    r  1     E_{r+1}   is induced by that on    E  r     subscript  E  r    E_{r}   via passage to cohomology.  A typical example is the cohomological Serre spectral sequence for a fibration    F  →  E  →  B       normal-→  F  E    normal-→    B     F\to E\to B   , B simply connected, when the coefficient group is a "ring" R . It has the multiplicative structure such that the limiting term    E  ∞     subscript  E     E_{\infty}   is isomorphic as graded algebra over R to the associated graded algebra of H( E ; R ), the latter having a ring structure induced by cup product. 5 The multiplicative structure on a spectral sequence can be very useful in calculating the spectral sequence; for some concrete example, see Serre spectral sequence#The Cohomology Ring of Complex Projective Space .  Constructions of spectral sequences  Spectral sequences can be constructed by various ways. In algebraic topology, an exact couple is perhaps the most common tool for the construction. In algebraic geometry, spectral sequences are usually constructed from filtrations of cochain complexes.  Exact couples  The most powerful technique for the construction of spectral sequences is William Massey 's method of exact couples. Exact couples are particularly common in algebraic topology, where there are many spectral sequences for which no other construction is known. In fact, all known spectral sequences can be constructed using exact couples. Despite this they are unpopular in abstract algebra, where most spectral sequences come from filtered complexes. To define exact couples, we begin again with an abelian category. As before, in practice this is usually the category of doubly graded modules over a ring. An exact couple is a pair of objects A and C , together with three homomorphisms between these objects: f : A → A , g : A → C and h : C → A subject to certain exactness conditions:   Image  f = Kernel  g  Image g = Kernel h  Image h = Kernel f   We will abbreviate this data by ( A , C , f , g , h ). Exact couples are usually depicted as triangles. We will see that C corresponds to the E 0 term of the spectral sequence and that A is some auxiliary data.  To pass to the next sheet of the spectral sequence, we will form the derived couple . We set:   d = g  o  h  A' = f ( A )  C' = Ker d / Im d  f' = f | A' , the restriction of f to A'  h' : C' → A' is induced by h . It is straightforward to see that h induces such a map.  g' : A' → C' is defined on elements as follows: For each a in A' , write a as f ( b ) for some b in A . g' ( a ) is defined to be the image of g ( b ) in C' . In general, g' can be constructed using one of the embedding theorems for abelian categories.   From here it is straightforward to check that ( A' , C' , f' , g' , h' ) is an exact couple. C' corresponds to the E 1 term of the spectral sequence. We can iterate this procedure to get exact couples ( A ( n ) , C ( n ) , f ( n ) , g ( n ) , h ( n ) ). We let E n be C ( n ) and d n be g ( n )  o  h ( n ) . This gives a spectral sequence.  For a simple example, see the Bockstein spectral sequence .  The spectral sequence of a filtered complex  A very common type of spectral sequence comes from a filtered cochain complex. This is a cochain complex C • together with a set of subcomplexes F p C • , where p ranges across all integers. (In practice, p is usually bounded on one side.) We require that the boundary map is compatible with the filtration; this means that d ( F p C n ) ⊆ F p C n+1 . We assume that the filtration is descending , i.e., F p C • ⊇ F p+1 C • . We will number the terms of the cochain complex by n . Later, we will also assume that the filtration is Hausdorff or separated , that is, the intersection of the set of all F p C • is zero, and that the filtration is exhaustive , that is, the union of the set of all F p C • is the entire chain complex C • .  The filtration is useful because it gives a measure of nearness to zero: As p increases, F p C • gets closer and closer to zero. We will construct a spectral sequence from this filtration where coboundaries and cocycles in later sheets get closer and closer to coboundaries and cocycles in the original complex. This spectral sequence is doubly graded by the filtration degree p and the complementary degree  q = n − p . (The complementary degree is often a more convenient index than the total degree n . For example, this is true of the spectral sequence of a double complex, explained below.)  We will construct this spectral sequence by hand. C • has only a single grading and a filtration, so we first construct a doubly graded object from C • . To get the second grading, we will take the associated graded object with respect to the filtration. We will write it in an unusual way which will be justified at the E 1 step:       Z   -  1    p  ,  q    =   Z  0   p  ,  q    =    F  p    C   p  +  q            superscript   subscript  Z    1     p  q     superscript   subscript  Z  0    p  q            superscript  F  p    superscript  C    p  q        Z_{-1}^{p,q}=Z_{0}^{p,q}=F^{p}C^{p+q}          B  0   p  ,  q    =  0       superscript   subscript  B  0    p  q    0    B_{0}^{p,q}=0          E  0   p  ,  q    =    Z  0   p  ,  q      B  0   p  ,  q    +   Z   -  1     p  +  1   ,   q  -  1       =     F  p    C   p  +  q       F   p  +  1     C   p  +  q             superscript   subscript  E  0    p  q       superscript   subscript  Z  0    p  q       superscript   subscript  B  0    p  q     superscript   subscript  Z    1       p  1     q  1                 superscript  F  p    superscript  C    p  q        superscript  F    p  1     superscript  C    p  q         E_{0}^{p,q}=\frac{Z_{0}^{p,q}}{B_{0}^{p,q}+Z_{-1}^{p+1,q-1}}=\frac{F^{p}C^{p+q%
 }}{F^{p+1}C^{p+q}}          E  0   =    ⊕    p  ,  q   ∈  ℤ     E  0   p  ,  q          subscript  E  0     subscript  direct-sum     p  q   ℤ     superscript   subscript  E  0    p  q       E_{0}=\bigoplus_{p,q\in\mathbb{Z}}E_{0}^{p,q}     Since we assumed that the boundary map was compatible with the filtration, E 0 is a doubly graded object and there is a natural doubly graded boundary map d 0 on E 0 . To get E 1 , we take the homology of E 0 .

For this to make sense, we must find a differential d r on each E r and verify that it leads to homology isomorphic to E r+1 . The differential       d  r   p  ,  q    :    E  r   p  ,  q    →   E  r    p  +  r   ,    q  -  r   +  1         normal-:   superscript   subscript  d  r    p  q     normal-→   superscript   subscript  E  r    p  q     superscript   subscript  E  r      p  r       q  r   1        d_{r}^{p,q}:E_{r}^{p,q}\rightarrow E_{r}^{p+r,q-r+1}     is defined by restricting the original differential d defined on    C   p  +  q      superscript  C    p  q     C^{p+q}   to the subobject    Z  r   p  ,  q      superscript   subscript  Z  r    p  q     Z_{r}^{p,q}   .  It is straightforward to check that the homology of E r with respect to this differential is E r+1 , so this gives a spectral sequence. Unfortunately, the differential is not very explicit. Determining differentials or finding ways to work around them is one of the main challenges to successfully applying a spectral sequence.  The spectral sequence of a double complex  Another common spectral sequence is the spectral sequence of a double complex. A double complex is a collection of objects C i,j for all integers i and j together with two differentials, d I and d II . d I is assumed to decrease i , and d II is assumed to decrease j . Furthermore, we assume that the differentials anticommute , so that d I d II + d II d I = 0. Our goal is to compare the iterated homologies     H  i  I    (    H  j   I  I     (   C   ∙  ,  ∙    )    )        subscript   superscript  H  I   i      subscript   superscript  H    I  I    j    subscript  C   normal-∙  normal-∙       H^{I}_{i}(H^{II}_{j}(C_{\bullet,\bullet}))   and     H  j   I  I     (    H  i  I    (   C   ∙  ,  ∙    )    )        subscript   superscript  H    I  I    j      subscript   superscript  H  I   i    subscript  C   normal-∙  normal-∙       H^{II}_{j}(H^{I}_{i}(C_{\bullet,\bullet}))   . We will do this by filtering our double complex in two different ways. Here are our filtrations:        (   C   i  ,  j   I   )   p   =   {     0      if  i   <  p        C   i  ,  j        if  i   ≥  p            subscript   superscript   subscript  C   i  j    I   p    cases  0      if  i   p    subscript  C   i  j        if  i   p      (C_{i,j}^{I})_{p}=\begin{cases}0&\text{if }i           (   C   i  ,  j    I  I    )   p   =   {     0      if  j   <  p        C   i  ,  j        if  j   ≥  p            subscript   superscript   subscript  C   i  j      I  I    p    cases  0      if  j   p    subscript  C   i  j        if  j   p      (C_{i,j}^{II})_{p}=\begin{cases}0&\text{if }j     To get a spectral sequence, we will reduce to the previous example. We define the total complex  T ( C •,• ) to be the complex whose n 'th term is     ⊕    i  +  j   =  n     C   i  ,  j        subscript  direct-sum      i  j   n     subscript  C   i  j      \bigoplus_{i+j=n}C_{i,j}   and whose differential is d I + d II . This is a complex because d I and d II are anticommuting differentials. The two filtrations on C i,j give two filtrations on the total complex:        T  n     (   C   ∙  ,  ∙    )   p  I    =    ⊕        i  +  j   =  n        i  >   p  -  1          C   i  ,  j            subscript  T  n    subscript   superscript   subscript  C   normal-∙  normal-∙    I   p      subscript  direct-sum   STACKED      i  j   n     i    p  1       subscript  C   i  j       T_{n}(C_{\bullet,\bullet})^{I}_{p}=\bigoplus_{i+j=n\atop i>p-1}C_{i,j}           T  n     (   C   ∙  ,  ∙    )   p   I  I     =    ⊕        i  +  j   =  n        j  >   p  -  1          C   i  ,  j            subscript  T  n    subscript   superscript   subscript  C   normal-∙  normal-∙      I  I    p      subscript  direct-sum   STACKED      i  j   n     j    p  1       subscript  C   i  j       T_{n}(C_{\bullet,\bullet})^{II}_{p}=\bigoplus_{i+j=n\atop j>p-1}C_{i,j}     To show that these spectral sequences give information about the iterated homologies, we will work out the E 0 , E 1 , and E 2 terms of the I filtration on T ( C •,• ). The E 0 term is clear:        E   p  ,  q   0    I   =      T  n     (   C   ∙  ,  ∙    )   p  I    /   T  n      (   C   ∙  ,  ∙    )    p  +  1   I    =    ⊕        i  +  j   =  n        i  >   p  -  1           C   i  ,  j    /    ⊕        i  +  j   =  n        i  >  p         C   i  ,  j       =   C   p  ,  q     ,         superscript   subscript   superscript  E  0    p  q    I          subscript  T  n    subscript   superscript   subscript  C   normal-∙  normal-∙    I   p     subscript  T  n     subscript   superscript   subscript  C   normal-∙  normal-∙    I     p  1            subscript  direct-sum   STACKED      i  j   n     i    p  1         subscript  C   i  j      subscript  direct-sum   STACKED      i  j   n     i  p      subscript  C   i  j             subscript  C   p  q       {}^{I}E^{0}_{p,q}=T_{n}(C_{\bullet,\bullet})^{I}_{p}/T_{n}(C_{\bullet,\bullet}%
 )^{I}_{p+1}=\bigoplus_{i+j=n\atop i>p-1}C_{i,j}\Big/\bigoplus_{i+j=n\atop i>p}%
 C_{i,j}=C_{p,q},   where .  To find the E 1 term, we need to determine d I + d II on E 0 . Notice that the differential must have degree −1 with respect to n , so we get a map        d   p  ,  q   I   +   d   p  ,  q    I  I     :       T  n     (   C   ∙  ,  ∙    )   p  I    /   T  n      (   C   ∙  ,  ∙    )    p  +  1   I    =   C   p  ,  q    →      T   n  -  1      (   C   ∙  ,  ∙    )   p  I    /   T   n  -  1       (   C   ∙  ,  ∙    )    p  +  1   I    =   C   p  ,   q  -  1         normal-:     subscript   superscript  d  I    p  q     subscript   superscript  d    I  I     p  q                subscript  T  n    subscript   superscript   subscript  C   normal-∙  normal-∙    I   p     subscript  T  n     subscript   superscript   subscript  C   normal-∙  normal-∙    I     p  1      subscript  C   p  q      normal-→           subscript  T    n  1     subscript   superscript   subscript  C   normal-∙  normal-∙    I   p     subscript  T    n  1      subscript   superscript   subscript  C   normal-∙  normal-∙    I     p  1           subscript  C   p    q  1         d^{I}_{p,q}+d^{II}_{p,q}:T_{n}(C_{\bullet,\bullet})^{I}_{p}/T_{n}(C_{\bullet,%

 {n-1}(C_{\bullet,\bullet})^{I}_{p+1}=C_{p,q-1}     Consequently, the differential on E 0 is the map C p , q → C p , q −1 induced by d I + d II . But d I has the wrong degree to induce such a map, so d I must be zero on E 0 . That means the differential is exactly d II , so we get        E   p  ,  q   1    I   =    H  q   I  I     (   C   p  ,  ∙    )     .       superscript   subscript   superscript  E  1    p  q    I      subscript   superscript  H    I  I    q    subscript  C   p  normal-∙       {}^{I}E^{1}_{p,q}=H^{II}_{q}(C_{p,\bullet}).     To find E 2 , we need to determine        d   p  ,  q   I   +   d   p  ,  q    I  I     :     H  q   I  I     (   C   p  ,  ∙    )    →    H  q   I  I     (   C    p  +  1   ,  ∙    )        normal-:     subscript   superscript  d  I    p  q     subscript   superscript  d    I  I     p  q      normal-→     subscript   superscript  H    I  I    q    subscript  C   p  normal-∙        subscript   superscript  H    I  I    q    subscript  C     p  1   normal-∙        d^{I}_{p,q}+d^{II}_{p,q}:H^{II}_{q}(C_{p,\bullet})\rightarrow H^{II}_{q}(C_{p+%
 1,\bullet})     Because E 1 was exactly the homology with respect to d II , d II is zero on E 1 . Consequently, we get        E   p  ,  q   2    I   =    H  p  I    (    H  q   I  I     (   C   ∙  ,  ∙    )    )     .       superscript   subscript   superscript  E  2    p  q    I      subscript   superscript  H  I   p      subscript   superscript  H    I  I    q    subscript  C   normal-∙  normal-∙        {}^{I}E^{2}_{p,q}=H^{I}_{p}(H^{II}_{q}(C_{\bullet,\bullet})).     Using the other filtration gives us a different spectral sequence with a similar E 2 term:        E   p  ,  q   2     I  I    =    H  q   I  I     (    H  p  I    (   C   ∙  ,  ∙    )    )     .       superscript   subscript   superscript  E  2    p  q      I  I       subscript   superscript  H    I  I    q      subscript   superscript  H  I   p    subscript  C   normal-∙  normal-∙        {}^{II}E^{2}_{p,q}=H^{II}_{q}(H^{I}_{p}(C_{\bullet,\bullet})).     What remains is to find a relationship between these two spectral sequences. It will turn out that as r increases, the two sequences will become similar enough to allow useful comparisons.  Convergence, degeneration, and abutment  In the elementary example that we began with, the sheets of the spectral sequence were constant once r was at least 1. In that setup it makes sense to take the limit of the sequence of sheets: Since nothing happens after the zeroth sheet, the limiting sheet E ∞ is the same as E 1 .  In more general situations, limiting sheets often exist and are always interesting. They are one of the most powerful aspects of spectral sequences. We say that a spectral sequence    E  r   p  ,  q      superscript   subscript  E  r    p  q     E_{r}^{p,q}    converges to or abuts to     E  ∞   p  ,  q      superscript   subscript  E     p  q     E_{\infty}^{p,q}   if there is an r ( p , q ) such that for all r ≥ r ( p , q ), the differentials    d  r    p  -  r   ,    q  +  r   -  1       superscript   subscript  d  r      p  r       q  r   1      d_{r}^{p-r,q+r-1}   and    d  r   p  ,  q      superscript   subscript  d  r    p  q     d_{r}^{p,q}   are zero. This forces    E  r   p  ,  q      superscript   subscript  E  r    p  q     E_{r}^{p,q}   to be isomorphic to    E  ∞   p  ,  q      superscript   subscript  E     p  q     E_{\infty}^{p,q}   for large r . In symbols, we write:       E  r   p  ,  q     ⇒  p    E  ∞   p  ,  q        subscript  normal-⇒  p    superscript   subscript  E  r    p  q     superscript   subscript  E     p  q      E_{r}^{p,q}\Rightarrow_{p}E_{\infty}^{p,q}     The p indicates the filtration index. It is very common to write the    E  2   p  ,  q      superscript   subscript  E  2    p  q     E_{2}^{p,q}   term on the left-hand side of the abutment, because this is the most useful term of most spectral sequences.  In most spectral sequences, the    E  ∞     subscript  E     E_{\infty}   term is not naturally a doubly graded object. Instead, there are usually    E  ∞  n     superscript   subscript  E    n    E_{\infty}^{n}   terms which come with a natural filtration     F  ∙    E  ∞  n        superscript  F  normal-∙    superscript   subscript  E    n     F^{\bullet}E_{\infty}^{n}   . In these cases, we set     E  ∞   p  ,  q    =    gr  p    E  ∞   p  +  q     =      F  p    E  ∞   p  +  q     /   F   p  +  1      E  ∞   p  +  q            superscript   subscript  E     p  q       subscript  gr  p    superscript   subscript  E      p  q                 superscript  F  p    superscript   subscript  E      p  q      superscript  F    p  1      superscript   subscript  E      p  q        E_{\infty}^{p,q}=\mbox{gr}_{p}E_{\infty}^{p+q}=F^{p}E_{\infty}^{p+q}/F^{p+1}E_%
 {\infty}^{p+q}   . We define convergence in the same way as before, but we write       E  r   p  ,  q     ⇒  p    E  ∞  n       subscript  normal-⇒  p    superscript   subscript  E  r    p  q     superscript   subscript  E    n     E_{r}^{p,q}\Rightarrow_{p}E_{\infty}^{n}     to mean that whenever p + q = n ,    E  r   p  ,  q      superscript   subscript  E  r    p  q     E_{r}^{p,q}   converges to    E  ∞   p  ,  q      superscript   subscript  E     p  q     E_{\infty}^{p,q}   .  The simplest situation in which we can determine convergence is when the spectral sequences degenerates. We say that the spectral sequences degenerates at sheet r if, for any s ≥ r , the differential d s is zero. This implies that E r ≅ E r +1 ≅ E r +2 ≅ ... In particular, it implies that E r is isomorphic to E ∞ . This is what happened in our first, trivial example of an unfiltered chain complex: The spectral sequence degenerated at the first sheet. In general, if a doubly graded spectral sequence is zero outside of a horizontal or vertical strip, the spectral sequence will degenerate, because later differentials will always go to or from an object not in the strip.  The spectral sequence also converges if    E  r   p  ,  q      superscript   subscript  E  r    p  q     E_{r}^{p,q}   vanishes for all p less than some p 0 and for all q less than some q 0 . If p 0 and q 0 can be chosen to be zero, this is called a first-quadrant spectral sequence . This sequence converges because each object is a fixed distance away from the edge of the non-zero region. Consequently, for a fixed p and q , the differential on later sheets always maps    E  r   p  ,  q      superscript   subscript  E  r    p  q     E_{r}^{p,q}   from or to the zero object; more visually, the differential leaves the quadrant where the terms are nonzero. The spectral sequence need not degenerate, however, because the differential maps might not all be zero at once. Similarly, the spectral sequence also converges if    E  r   p  ,  q      superscript   subscript  E  r    p  q     E_{r}^{p,q}   vanishes for all p greater than some p 0 and for all q greater than some q 0 .  The five-term exact sequence of a spectral sequence relates certain low-degree terms and E ∞ terms.  See also Boardman, Conditionally Convergent Spectral Sequences .

E  ∞   p  ,  q      superscript   subscript  E     p  q     E_{\infty}^{p,q}   is a natural candidate for the abutment of this spectral sequence. Convergence is not automatic, but happens in many cases. In particular, if the filtration is finite and consists of exactly r nontrivial steps, then the spectral sequence degenerates after the r 'th sheet. Convergence also occurs if the complex and the filtration are both bounded below or both bounded above.  To describe the abutment of our spectral sequence in more detail, notice that we have the formulas:       Z  ∞   p  ,  q    =    ⋂   r  =  0   ∞    Z  r   p  ,  q     =    ⋂   r  =  0   ∞    ker   (     F  p    C   p  +  q     →     C   p  +  q  +  1    /   F   p  +  r      C   p  +  q  +  1      )            superscript   subscript  Z     p  q      superscript   subscript     r  0       superscript   subscript  Z  r    p  q            superscript   subscript     r  0       kernel   normal-→     superscript  F  p    superscript  C    p  q          superscript  C    p  q  1     superscript  F    p  r      superscript  C    p  q  1           Z_{\infty}^{p,q}=\bigcap_{r=0}^{\infty}Z_{r}^{p,q}=\bigcap_{r=0}^{\infty}\ker(%

This implies that as r increases, the kernels shrink, until we are left with     Z  ∞   p  ,  q    =   ker   (     F  p    C   p  +  q     →   C   p  +  q  +  1     )         superscript   subscript  Z     p  q     kernel   normal-→     superscript  F  p    superscript  C    p  q      superscript  C    p  q  1        Z_{\infty}^{p,q}=\ker(F^{p}C^{p+q}\rightarrow C^{p+q+1})   . For    B  ∞   p  ,  q      superscript   subscript  B     p  q     B_{\infty}^{p,q}   , recall that we assumed that the filtration was exhaustive. This implies that as r increases, the images grow until we reach     B  ∞   p  ,  q    =  im   (   C    p  +  q   -  1    →   C   p  +  q    )   ∩   F  p    C   p  +  q       fragments   superscript   subscript  B     p  q     im   fragments  normal-(   superscript  C      p  q   1    normal-→   superscript  C    p  q    normal-)     superscript  F  p    superscript  C    p  q      B_{\infty}^{p,q}=\text{im }(C^{p+q-1}\rightarrow C^{p+q})\cap F^{p}C^{p+q}   . We conclude       E  ∞   p  ,  q    =    gr  p    H   p  +  q     (   C   \bull    )         superscript   subscript  E     p  q       subscript  gr  p    superscript  H    p  q     superscript  C  \bull      E_{\infty}^{p,q}=\mbox{gr}_{p}H^{p+q}(C^{\bull})   ,  that is, the abutment of the spectral sequence is the p 'th graded part of the p+q 'th homology of C . If our spectral sequence converges, then we conclude that:       E  r   p  ,  q     ⇒  p     H   p  +  q     (   C   \bull    )        subscript  normal-⇒  p    superscript   subscript  E  r    p  q       superscript  H    p  q     superscript  C  \bull      E_{r}^{p,q}\Rightarrow_{p}H^{p+q}(C^{\bull})     Long exact sequences  Using the spectral sequence of a filtered complex, we can derive the existence of long exact sequences . Choose a short exact sequence of cochain complexes 0 → A • → B • → C • → 0, and call the first map f • : A • → B • . We get natural maps of homology objects H n ( A • ) → H n ( B • ) → H n ( C • ), and we know that this is exact in the middle. We will use the spectral sequence of a filtered complex to find the connecting homomorphism and to prove that the resulting sequence is exact. To start, we filter B • :        F  0    B  n    =   B  n          superscript  F  0    superscript  B  n     superscript  B  n     F^{0}B^{n}=B^{n}           F  1    B  n    =   A  n          superscript  F  1    superscript  B  n     superscript  A  n     F^{1}B^{n}=A^{n}           F  2    B  n    =  0         superscript  F  2    superscript  B  n    0    F^{2}B^{n}=0     This gives:       E  0   p  ,  q    =     F  p    B   p  +  q       F   p  +  1     B   p  +  q      =   {     0     if  p   <   0  or  p   >   1        C  q       if  p   =  0        A   q  +  1        if  p   =  1              subscript   superscript  E   p  q    0        superscript  F  p    superscript  B    p  q        superscript  F    p  1     superscript  B    p  q            cases  0    if  p   expectation    0  or  p    1    superscript  C  q       if  p   0    superscript  A    q  1        if  p   1       E^{p,q}_{0}=\frac{F^{p}B^{p+q}}{F^{p+1}B^{p+q}}=\begin{cases}0&\text{if }p<0%

These are the connecting homomorphisms from the snake lemma , and together with the maps A • → B • → C • , they give a sequence:      ⋯  →    H  q    (   B   \bull    )    →    H  q    (   C   \bull    )    →    H   q  +  1     (   A   \bull    )    →    H   q  +  1     (   B   \bull    )    →  ⋯       normal-→  normal-⋯     superscript  H  q    superscript  B  \bull      normal-→       superscript  H  q    superscript  C  \bull      normal-→       superscript  H    q  1     superscript  A  \bull      normal-→       superscript  H    q  1     superscript  B  \bull      normal-→    normal-⋯     \cdots\rightarrow H^{q}(B^{\bull})\rightarrow H^{q}(C^{\bull})\rightarrow H^{q%
 +1}(A^{\bull})\rightarrow H^{q+1}(B^{\bull})\rightarrow\cdots     It remains to show that this sequence is exact at the A and C spots. Notice that this spectral sequence degenerates at the E 2 term because the differentials have bidegree (2, −1). Consequently, the E 2 term is the same as the E ∞ term:       E  2   p  ,  q    ≅    gr  p    H   p  +  q     (   B   \bull    )    =   {     0     if  p   <   0  or  p   >   1           H  q    (   B   \bull    )    /   H  q     (   A   \bull    )        if  p   =  0         im   H   q  +  1     f   \bull     :     H   q  +  1     (   A   \bull    )    →    H   q  +  1     (   B   \bull    )          if  p   =  1              subscript   superscript  E   p  q    2      subscript  gr  p    superscript  H    p  q     superscript  B  \bull          cases  0    if  p   expectation    0  or  p    1          superscript  H  q    superscript  B  \bull     superscript  H  q     superscript  A  \bull        if  p   0    normal-:    im   superscript  H    q  1     superscript  f  \bull     normal-→     superscript  H    q  1     superscript  A  \bull       superscript  H    q  1     superscript  B  \bull          if  p   1       E^{p,q}_{2}\cong\text{gr}_{p}H^{p+q}(B^{\bull})=\begin{cases}0&\text{if }p<0%

 {q+1}(A^{\bull}))     The former gives exactness at the C spot, and the latter gives exactness at the A spot.  The spectral sequence of a double complex, continued  Using the abutment for a filtered complex, we find that:        H  p  I    (    H  q   I  I     (   C    \bull   ,   \bull     )    )     ⇒  p     H   p  +  q     (   T   (   C    \bull   ,   \bull     )    )        subscript  normal-⇒  p      subscript   superscript  H  I   p      subscript   superscript  H    I  I    q    subscript  C   \bull  \bull         superscript  H    p  q      T   subscript  C   \bull  \bull        H^{I}_{p}(H^{II}_{q}(C_{\bull,\bull}))\Rightarrow_{p}H^{p+q}(T(C_{\bull,\bull}))           H  q   I  I     (    H  p  I    (   C    \bull   ,   \bull     )    )     ⇒  q     H   p  +  q     (   T   (   C    \bull   ,   \bull     )    )        subscript  normal-⇒  q      subscript   superscript  H    I  I    q      subscript   superscript  H  I   p    subscript  C   \bull  \bull         superscript  H    p  q      T   subscript  C   \bull  \bull        H^{II}_{q}(H^{I}_{p}(C_{\bull,\bull}))\Rightarrow_{q}H^{p+q}(T(C_{\bull,\bull}))     In general, the two gradings on H p+q (T(C •,• )) are distinct . Despite this, it is still possible to gain useful information from these two spectral sequences.  Commutativity of Tor  Let R be a ring, let M be a right R -module and N a left R -module. Recall that the derived functors of the tensor product are denoted Tor . Tor is defined using a projective resolution of its first argument. However, it turns out that Tor i ( M , N ) = Tor i ( N , M ). While this can be verified without a spectral sequence, it is very easy with spectral sequences.  Choose projective resolutions P • and Q • of M and N , respectively. Consider these as complexes which vanish in negative degree having differentials d and e , respectively. We can construct a double complex whose terms are C i,j = P i ⊗ Q j and whose differentials are d ⊗ 1 and (−1) i (1 ⊗ e ). (The factor of −1 is so that the differentials anticommute.) Since projective modules are flat, taking the tensor product with a projective module commutes with taking homology, so we get:        H  p  I    (    H  q   I  I     (    P   \bull    ⊗   Q   \bull     )    )    =    H  p  I    (     P   \bull    ⊗   H  q   I  I      (   Q   \bull    )    )           subscript   superscript  H  I   p      subscript   superscript  H    I  I    q    tensor-product   subscript  P  \bull    subscript  Q  \bull         subscript   superscript  H  I   p      tensor-product   subscript  P  \bull    subscript   superscript  H    I  I    q     subscript  Q  \bull       H^{I}_{p}(H^{II}_{q}(P_{\bull}\otimes Q_{\bull}))=H^{I}_{p}(P_{\bull}\otimes H%
 ^{II}_{q}(Q_{\bull}))           H  q   I  I     (    H  p  I    (    P   \bull    ⊗   Q   \bull     )    )    =    H  q   I  I     (     H  p  I    (   P   \bull    )    ⊗   Q   \bull     )           subscript   superscript  H    I  I    q      subscript   superscript  H  I   p    tensor-product   subscript  P  \bull    subscript  Q  \bull         subscript   superscript  H    I  I    q    tensor-product     subscript   superscript  H  I   p    subscript  P  \bull     subscript  Q  \bull       H^{II}_{q}(H^{I}_{p}(P_{\bull}\otimes Q_{\bull}))=H^{II}_{q}(H^{I}_{p}(P_{%
 \bull})\otimes Q_{\bull})     Since the two complexes are resolutions, their homology vanishes outside of degree zero. In degree zero, we are left with        H  p  I    (    P   \bull    ⊗  N   )    =    Tor  p    (  M  ,  N  )           subscript   superscript  H  I   p    tensor-product   subscript  P  \bull   N       subscript  Tor  p    M  N      H^{I}_{p}(P_{\bull}\otimes N)=\mbox{Tor}_{p}(M,N)           H  q   I  I     (   M  ⊗   Q   \bull     )    =    Tor  q    (  N  ,  M  )           subscript   superscript  H    I  I    q    tensor-product  M   subscript  Q  \bull        subscript  Tor  q    N  M      H^{II}_{q}(M\otimes Q_{\bull})=\mbox{Tor}_{q}(N,M)     In particular, the    E   p  ,  q   2     subscript   superscript  E  2    p  q     E^{2}_{p,q}   terms vanish except along the lines q = 0 (for the I spectral sequence) and p = 0 (for the II spectral sequence). This implies that the spectral sequence degenerates at the second sheet, so the E ∞ terms are isomorphic to the E 2 terms:        Tor  p    (  M  ,  N  )    ≅   E  p  ∞   =    H  p    (   T   (   C    \bull   ,   \bull     )    )             subscript  Tor  p    M  N     subscript   superscript  E    p           subscript  H  p     T   subscript  C   \bull  \bull         \mbox{Tor}_{p}(M,N)\cong E^{\infty}_{p}=H_{p}(T(C_{\bull,\bull}))           Tor  q    (  N  ,  M  )    ≅   E  q  ∞   =    H  q    (   T   (   C    \bull   ,   \bull     )    )             subscript  Tor  q    N  M     subscript   superscript  E    q           subscript  H  q     T   subscript  C   \bull  \bull         \mbox{Tor}_{q}(N,M)\cong E^{\infty}_{q}=H_{q}(T(C_{\bull,\bull}))     Finally, when p and q are equal, the two right-hand sides are equal, and the commutativity of Tor follows.
