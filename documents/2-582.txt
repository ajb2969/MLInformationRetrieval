   Phi      Phi   Phi (uppercase Φ , lowercase  or ; , pheî , ; modern , fi , ; English: 1 ) is the 21st letter of the Greek alphabet . In Ancient Greek , it represented an aspirated  voiceless bilabial plosive (), which was the origin of its usual romanization as "ph". In modern Greek, it represents a voiceless labiodental fricative () and is correspondingly romanized as "f". Its origin is uncertain but it may be that phi originated as the letter qoppa and initially represented the sound  before shifting to Classical Greek . 2 In traditional Greek numerals , phi has a value of 500 () or  (). The Cyrillic letter Ef (Ф, ф) descends from phi.  Phi is also used as a symbol for the golden ratio and on other occasions in math and science. This use is separately encoded as the Unicode glyph . The modern Greek pronunciation of the letter is sometimes encountered in English (as ) when the letter is being used in this sense. 3  Use as a symbol  The lower-case letter φ (or often its variant, ) is often used to represent the following:   The golden ratio       1  +   5    2   ≈           1    5    2   absent    \tfrac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\approx   ... in mathematics, art, and architecture.

In algebra, group or ring  homomorphisms  In probability theory , is the probability density function of the normal distribution .  In probability theory , is the characteristic function of a random variable X .  An angle , typically the second angle mentioned, after θ ( theta ). Especially:  The argument of a complex number .  The phase of a wave in signal processing.  In spherical coordinates , mathematicians usually refer to phi as the polar angle (from the z - axis ). The convention in physics is to use phi as the azimuthal angle (from the x -axis).

The symbol for a voiceless bilabial fricative in the International Phonetic Alphabet (using the straight line variant character)  In economics, this is usually an additive term.  In flight dynamics , the roll angle.  In philosophy , φ is often used as shorthand for a generic act. (Also in upper-case.)   The upper-case letter Φ is used as a symbol for:   The golden ratio conjugate −0.618... in mathematics.  The magnetic flux and electric flux in physics, with subscripts distinguishing the two.  The cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution in mathematics and statistics .  In philosophy , Φ is often used as shorthand for a generic act. (Also in lower-case.)  The number of phases in a power system in electrical engineering , for example 1Φ for single phase , 3Φ for three phase .  A common symbol for the parametrization of a surface in vector calculus .  In Lacanian algebra , Φ stands for the imaginary phallus and also represents phallic signification; -Φ stands in for castration. 4   The diameter symbol in engineering , ⌀ , is often incorrectly referred to as "phi". This symbol is used to indicate the diameter of a circular section; for example, "⌀14" means the diameter of the circle is 14 units .  Computing  In Unicode , there are multiple forms of the phi letter:      Character   Name   Correct appearance   Your browser   Usage        GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PHI      Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi\,\!       used in Greek texts     U+03C6   GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI   or    used in Greek texts     U+03D5   GREEK PHI SYMBOL      ϕ   ϕ   \phi\,\!       used in mathematical and technical contexts 5     U+0278   LATIN SMALL LETTER PHI  (Figure)  Xsampa-pslash.png     used in IPA to symbolise a voiceless bilabial fricative     In ordinary Greek text, the character U+03C6 φ is used exclusively, although this character has considerable glyphic variation, sometimes represented with a glyph more like the representative glyph shown for U+03C6 (φ, the “loopy” form) and less often with a glyph more like the representative glyph shown for U+03D5 (ϕ, the “straight“ form).  Because Unicode represents a character in an abstract way, the choice between glyphs is purely a matter of font design. While some Greek typefaces, most notably "Porson" typefaces (used widely in editions of classical Greek texts), have a "stroked" glyph in this position (), most other typefaces have "loopy" glyphs. This goes for the "Didot" (or " apla ") typefaces employed in most Greek book printing (), as well as for the "Neohellenic" typeface often used for ancient texts ().  It is necessary to have the stroked glyph available for some mathematical uses, and U+03D5 GREEK PHI SYMBOL is designed for this function. Prior to Unicode version 3.0 (1998), the glyph assignments in the Unicode code charts were the reverse, and thus older fonts may still show a loopy form   φ   φ   \varphi   at U+03D5. 6  For use as a phonetic symbol in IPA , Unicode has a separate codepoint U+0278, LATIN SMALL LETTER PHI, because in this use only the stroked glyph is considered correct. It typically appears in a form adapted to a Latin typographic environment, with a more upright shape than normal Greek letters and with serifs at the top and bottom.  In HTML/ XHTML , the upper- and lower-case phi character entity references are Φ (Φ) and φ (φ), respectively.  In LaTeX , the math symbols are \Phi (   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi\,\!   ), \phi (   ϕ   ϕ   \phi\,\!   ), and \varphi (   φ   φ   \varphi\,\!   ).  The Unicode standard also includes the following variants of phi and phi-like characters:      Character   Name   Appearance       U+1D60   MODIFIER LETTER SMALL GREEK PHI      U+1D69   GREEK SUBSCRIPT SMALL LETTER PHI      U+1DB2   MODIFIER LETTER SMALL PHI      U+2CAA   COPTIC CAPITAL LETTER FI      U+2CAB   COPTIC SMALL LETTER FI      U+2C77   LATIN SMALL LETTER TAILLESS PHI      U+1D6BD   MATHEMATICAL BOLD CAPITAL PHI      U+1D6D7   MATHEMATICAL BOLD SMALL PHI      U+1D6DF   MATHEMATICAL BOLD PHI SYMBOL      U+1D6F7   MATHEMATICAL ITALIC CAPITAL PHI      U+1D711   MATHEMATICAL ITALIC SMALL PHI      U+1D719   MATHEMATICAL ITALIC PHI SYMBOL      U+1D731   MATHEMATICAL BOLD ITALIC CAPITAL PHI      U+1D74B   MATHEMATICAL BOLD ITALIC SMALL PHI      U+1D753   MATHEMATICAL BOLD ITALIC PHI SYMBOL      U+1D76B   MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF BOLD CAPITAL PHI      U+1D785   MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF BOLD SMALL PHI      U+1D78D   MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF BOLD PHI SYMBOL      U+1D7A5   MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF BOLD ITALIC CAPITAL PHI      U+1D7BF   MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF BOLD ITALIC SMALL PHI      U+1D7C7   MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF BOLD ITALIC PHI SYMBOL      See also   F, f: Ef (Latin)  Ф, ф: Ef (Cyrillic)  Psi and phi type figurine  Փ ( Armenian letter )  Deposition (geology)   References  "  Category:Greek letters     Oxford English Dictionary , 3rd ed.
