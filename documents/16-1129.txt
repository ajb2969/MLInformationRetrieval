   Topographic Wetness Index      Topographic Wetness Index  The '''topographic wetness index''' ('''TWI'''), also known as the compound topographic index (CTI), is a steady state wetness index. It is commonly used to quantify topographic control on [[hydrology|hydrological]] processes. {{cite journal |last=Sørensen|first=R. |last2=Zinko |first2=U. |last3=Seibert| first3=J.|title=On the calculation of the topographic wetness index: evaluation of different methods based on field observations |journal=Hydrology and Earth System Sciences |volume=10|year=20 06 |pages=101–112}} The index is a function of both the slope and the upstream contributing area per unit width orthogonal to the flow direction. The index was designed for hillslope catenas . Accumulation numbers in flat areas will be very large, so TWI will not be a relevant variable. The index is highly correlated with several soil attributes such as horizon depth, silt percentage, organic matter content, and phosphorus . 1 Methods of computing this index differ primarily in the way the upslope contributing area is calculated.  Definition  The topographic wetness index is defined as:      ln   a   t  a  n  b          a    t  a  n  b      \ln{a\over tanb}     where 'a' is the local upslope area draining through a certain point per unit contour length and tan b is the local slope in radians . The TWI has been used to study spatial scale effects on hydrological processes. The topographic wetness index (TWI) was developed by Beven and Kirkby 2 within the runoff model TOPMODEL.  Uses  The TWI has been used to study spatial scale effects on hydrological processes and to identify hydrological flow paths for geochemical modelling, as well as to characterize biological processes such as annual net primary production , vegetation patterns, and forest site quality.
