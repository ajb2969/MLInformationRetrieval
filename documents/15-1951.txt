Dunham expansion

In quantum chemistry, the Dunham expansion is an expression for the rotational-vibrational energy levels of a diatomic molecule: 1


 
  where v and J are the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. The constant coefficients 
 
 
 
  are called Dunham parameters with 
 
 
 
  representing the electronic energy. The expression derives from a semiclassical treatment of a perturbational approach to deriving the energy levels.2 The Dunham parameters are typically calculated by a least-squares fitting procedure of energy levels with the quantum numbers.
