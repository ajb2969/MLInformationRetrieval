   Harish-Chandra isomorphism      Harish-Chandra isomorphism   In mathematics , the Harish-Chandra isomorphism , introduced by , is an isomorphism of commutative rings constructed in the theory of Lie algebras . The isomorphism maps the center  Z ( U ( g )) of the universal enveloping algebra  U ( g ) of a reductive Lie algebra  g to the elements S ( h ) W of the symmetric algebra  S ( h ) of a Cartan subalgebra  h that are invariant under the Weyl group  W .  Fundamental invariants  Let n be the rank of g , which is the dimension of the Cartan subalgebra h . H. S. M. Coxeter observed that S ( h ) W is a polynomial algebra in n variables (see Chevalley–Shephard–Todd theorem for a more general statement). Therefore, the center of the universal enveloping algebra of a reductive Lie algebra is a polynomial algebra. The degrees of the generators are the degrees of the fundamental invariants given in the following table.

Examples   If g is the Lie algebra sl (2, R ), then the center of the universal enveloping algebra is generated by the Casimir invariant of degree 2, and the Weyl group acts on the Cartan subalgebra, which is isomorphic to R , by negation, so the invariant of the Weyl group is simply the square of the generator of the Cartan subalgebra, which is also of degree 2.   Introduction and setting  Let g be a semisimple Lie algebra , h its Cartan subalgebra and λ, μ ∈ h * be two elements of the weight space and assume that a set of positive roots Φ + have been fixed. Let V λ , resp. V μ be highest weight modules with highest weight λ, resp. μ.  Central characters  The g -modules V λ and V μ are representations of the universal enveloping algebra  U ( g ) and its center acts on the modules by scalar multiplication (this follows from the fact that the modules are generated by a highest weight vector). So, for v in V λ and x in Z ( U ( g )),       x  ⋅  v   :=    χ  λ    (  x  )   v      assign   normal-⋅  x  v      subscript  χ  λ   x  v     x\cdot v:=\chi_{\lambda}(x)v   and similarly for V μ .  The functions     χ  λ   ,   χ  μ       subscript  χ  λ    subscript  χ  μ     \chi_{\lambda},\,\chi_{\mu}   are homomorphims to scalars called central characters .  Statement of Harish-Chandra theorem  For any λ, μ ∈ h *, the characters     χ  λ   =   χ  μ        subscript  χ  λ    subscript  χ  μ     \chi_{\lambda}=\chi_{\mu}   if and only if λ+δ and μ+δ are on the same orbit of the Weyl group of h *, where δ is the half-sum of the positive roots . 1  Another closely related formulation is that the Harish-Chandra homomorphism from the center of the universal enveloping algebra  Z ( U ( g )) to S ( h ) W (the elements of the symmetric algebra of the Cartan subalgebra fixed by the Weyl group) is an isomorphism .  Applications  The theorem may be used to obtain a simple algebraic proof of Weyl's character formula for finite-dimensional representations.  Further, it is a necessary condition for the existence of a nonzero homomorphism of some highest weight modules (a homomorphism of such modules preserves central character). A simple consequence is that for Verma modules or generalized Verma modules  V λ with highest weight λ, there exist only finitely many weights μ such that a nonzero homomorphism V λ → V μ exists.
