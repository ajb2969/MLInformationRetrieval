   Superpartient ratio      Superpartient ratio   In mathematics, a superpartient ratio or superpartient number is a rational number that is greater than one and is not superparticular . The term has fallen out of use in modern pure mathematics, but continues to be used in music theory and in the historical study of mathematics .  Mathematically, a superpartient number is a ratio of the form         n  +  a   n   ,         n  a   n    \frac{n+a}{n}\,,   where a is greater than 1 ( a > 1) and is also coprime (reduced to its lowest terms) to n . Ratios of the form     n  +  1   n        n  1   n    \tfrac{n+1}{n}   are also greater than one, but are called superparticular ratios and are not considered as superpartient.
