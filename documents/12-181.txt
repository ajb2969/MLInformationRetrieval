   Idempotent measure      Idempotent measure   In mathematics , an idempotent measure on a metric group is a probability measure that equals its convolution with itself; in other words, an idempotent measure is an idempotent element in the topological semigroup of probability measures on the given metric group.  Explicitly, given a metric group X and two probability measures μ and ν on X , the convolution μ ∗ ν of μ and ν is the measure given by        (   μ  *  ν   )    (  A  )    =    ∫  X    μ   (   A   x   -  1     )   d  ν   (  x  )     =    ∫  X    ν   (    x   -  1    A   )   d  μ   (  x  )               μ  ν   A     subscript   X     μ    A   superscript  x    1     normal-d  ν  x           subscript   X     ν     superscript  x    1    A   normal-d  μ  x       (\mu*\nu)(A)=\int_{X}\mu(Ax^{-1})\,\mathrm{d}\nu(x)=\int_{X}\nu(x^{-1}A)\,%
 \mathrm{d}\mu(x)     for any Borel subset A of X . (The equality of the two integrals follows from Fubini's theorem .) With respect to the topology of weak convergence of measures , the operation of convolution makes the space of probability measures on X into a topological semigroup. Thus, μ is said to be an idempotent measure if μ ∗ μ = μ .  It can be shown that the only idempotent probability measures on a complete , separable metric group are the normalized Haar measures of compact  subgroups .
