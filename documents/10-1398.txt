   L-ascorbate oxidase      L-ascorbate oxidase   In enzymology , a L-ascorbate oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 L-ascorbate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 dehydroascorbate + 2 H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L- ascorbate and O 2 , whereas its two products are dehydroascorbate and H 2 O .  Function  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on diphenols and related substances as donor with oxygen as acceptor. This enzyme participates in ascorbate metabolism. It employs one cofactor , copper .  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-ascorbate:oxygen oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include ascorbase, ascorbic acid oxidase, ascorbate oxidase, ascorbic oxidase, ascorbate dehydrogenase, L-ascorbic acid oxidase, AAO, L-ascorbate:O2 oxidoreductase, and AA oxidase.
