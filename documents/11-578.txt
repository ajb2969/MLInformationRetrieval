Surface force

Surface force denoted fs is the force that acts across an internal or external surface element in a material body. Surface force can be decomposed into two perpendicular components: pressure and stress forces. Pressure force acts normally over an area and stress force acts tangentially over an area.
Equations for surface force
Surface force due to pressure



f = Force, p = pressure, A = cross sectional area of the moving fluid
