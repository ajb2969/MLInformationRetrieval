   Amagat's law      Amagat's law   '''Amagat's law ''' or the Law of Partial Volumes of 1880 describes the behaviour and properties of mixtures of ideal (as well as some cases of non-ideal) gases. Of use in chemistry and thermodynamics , Amagat's law states that the extensive volume V = N·v of a gas mixture is equal to the sum of volumes V i of the K component gases, if the temperature T and the pressure p remain the same: 1 2         N  ⋅  v    (  T  ,  p  )    =    ∑   i  =  1   K      N  i   ⋅   v  i     (  T  ,  p  )      .         normal-⋅  N  v    T  p      superscript   subscript     i  1    K      normal-⋅   subscript  N  i    subscript  v  i     T  p       N\cdot v(T,p)=\sum_{i=1}^{K}N_{i}\cdot v_{i}(T,p).     This is the experimental expression of volume as an extensive quantity . It is named after Emile Amagat .  According to Amagat’s law of partial volume, the total volume of a non-reacting mixture of gases at constant temperature and pressure should be equal to the sum of the individual partial volumes of the constituent gases. So if     V  1   ,   V  2   ,  …  ,   V  n       subscript  V  1    subscript  V  2   normal-…   subscript  V  n     V_{1},V_{2},\dots,V_{n}   are considered to be the partial volumes of components in the gaseous mixture, then the total volume   V   V   V   would be represented as:      V  =    V  1   +   V  2   +   V  3   +  …  +   V  n    =    ∑  i    V  i          V     subscript  V  1    subscript  V  2    subscript  V  3   normal-…   subscript  V  n           subscript   i    subscript  V  i       V=V_{1}+V_{2}+V_{3}+\dots+V_{n}=\sum_{i}V_{i}     Both Amagat's and Dalton's Laws predict the properties of gas mixtures. Their predictions are the same for ideal gases . However, for real (non-ideal) gases, the results differ. 3  Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures assumes that the gases in the mixture are non- interacting (with each other) and each gas independently applies its own pressure , the sum of which is the total pressure. Amagat's Law assumes that the volumes of the component gases (again at the same temperature and pressure) are additive; the interactions of the different gases are the same as the average interactions of the components.  The interactions can be interpreted in terms of a second virial coefficient , B(T), for the mixture. For two components, the second virial coefficient for the mixture can be expressed as:       B   (  T  )    =     X  1    B  1    +    X  2    B  2    +    X  1    X  2    B   1  ,  2            B  T        subscript  X  1    subscript  B  1       subscript  X  2    subscript  B  2       subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2    subscript  B   1  2        B(T)=X_{1}B_{1}+X_{2}B_{2}+X_{1}X_{2}B_{1,2}     where the subscripts refer to components 1 and 2, the X's are the mole fractions, and the B's are the second virial coefficients . The cross term, B 1,2 , of the mixture is given by:       B   1  ,  2    =  0       subscript  B   1  2    0    B_{1,2}=0   ( Dalton's Law )  and       B   1  ,  2    =    (    B  1   +   B  2    )   /  2        subscript  B   1  2         subscript  B  1    subscript  B  2    2     B_{1,2}=(B_{1}+B_{2})/2   (Amagat's Law).  When the volumes of each component gas (same temperature and pressure) are very similar, then Amagat's law becomes mathematically equivalent to Vegard's law for solid mixtures.
