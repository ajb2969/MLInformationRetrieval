Monk's formula

In mathematics, Monk's formula, found by , is an analogue of Pieri's formula that describes the product of a linear Schubert polynomial by a Schubert polynomial. Equivalently, it describes the product of a special Schubert cycle by a Schubert cycle in the cohomology of a flag manifold.
Write tij for the transposition (i j), and si = ti,i+1. Then ùîñsr = x1 + ‚ãØ + xr, and Monk's formula states that for a permutation w,



where 
 
 
 
 
  is the length of w. The pairs (i, j) appearing in the sum are exactly those such that i ‚â§ r i j, and there is no i i k j; each wtij is a cover of w in Bruhat order.
