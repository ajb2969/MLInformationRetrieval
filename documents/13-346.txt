   Monk's formula      Monk's formula   In mathematics, Monk's formula , found by , is an analogue of Pieri's formula that describes the product of a linear Schubert polynomial by a Schubert polynomial. Equivalently, it describes the product of a special Schubert cycle by a Schubert cycle in the cohomology of a flag manifold .  Write t ij for the transposition  (i j) , and s i = t i,i+1 . Then 𝔖 s r = x 1 + ⋯ + x r , and Monk's formula states that for a permutation w ,         𝔖   s  r     𝔖  w    =    ∑       i  ≤  r  <  j         ℓ   (   w   t   i  j     )    =    ℓ   (  w  )    +  1          𝔖   w   t   i  j        ,         subscript  𝔖   subscript  s  r     subscript  𝔖  w      subscript    STACKED      i  r       j        normal-ℓ    w   subscript  t    i  j          normal-ℓ  w   1       subscript  𝔖    w   subscript  t    i  j         \mathfrak{S}_{s_{r}}\mathfrak{S}_{w}=\sum_{{i\leq r     where    ℓ   (  w  )       normal-ℓ  w    \ell(w)   is the length of w . The pairs ( i , j ) appearing in the sum are exactly those such that i ≤ r i j, and there is no i i k j; each wt ij is a cover of w in Bruhat order .  References     "  Category:Symmetric functions
