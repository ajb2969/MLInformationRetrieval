   Presentation complex      Presentation complex   In geometric group theory , a presentation complex is a 2-dimensional cell complex associated to any presentation of a group  G . The complex has a single vertex, and one loop at the vertex for each generator of G . There is one 2-cell for each relation in the presentation, with the boundary of the 2-cell attached along the appropriate word .  Properties   The fundamental group of the presentation complex is the group G itself.  The universal cover of the presentation complex is a Cayley complex for G , whose 1-skeleton is the Cayley graph of G .  Any presentation complex for G is the 2-skeleton of an Eilenberg–Maclane space  K ( G ,1).   Example  Let G = Z 2 be the two-dimensional integer lattice , with a presentation       G  =   ⟨   x  ,  y   |   x  y   x   -  1     y   -  1     ⟩    .      G   inner-product   x  y     x  y   superscript  x    1     superscript  y    1        G=\langle x,y|xyx^{-1}y^{-1}\rangle.     Then the presentation complex for G is a torus , obtained by gluing the opposite sides of a square, the 2-cell, which are labelled x and y . All four corners of the square are glued into a single vertex, the 0-cell of the presentation complex, while a pair consisting of a longtitudal and meridian circles on the torus, intersecting at the vertex, constitutes its 1-skeleton.  The associated Cayley complex is a regular tiling of the plane by unit squares. The 1-skeleton of this complex is a Cayley graph for Z 2 .  References   Roger C. Lyndon and Paul E.
