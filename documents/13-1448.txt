Mills ratio

In probability theory, the Mills ratio (or Mills's ratio1) of a continuous random variable

 
  is the function



where 
 
 
 
  is the probability density function, and



is the complementary cumulative distribution function (also called survival function). The concept is named after John P. Mills. The Mills ratio is related2 to the hazard rate h(x) which is defined as



by



Example
If 
 
 
 
  has standard normal distribution then


 
  where the sign 
 
 
 
  means that the quotient of the two functions converges to 1 as 
 
 
 
 . More precise asymptotics can be given.3
