   Mills ratio      Mills ratio   In probability theory , the Mills ratio (or Mills's ratio 1 ) of a continuous random variable    X   X   X   is the function        m   (  x  )    :=     F  ¯    (  x  )     f   (  x  )      ,     assign    m  x        normal-¯  F   x     f  x      m(x):=\frac{\bar{F}(x)}{f(x)},     where    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   is the probability density function , and        F  ¯    (  x  )    :=   Pr   [   X  >  x   ]    =    ∫  x   +  ∞     f   (  u  )   d  u         assign     normal-¯  F   x    Pr    X  x           superscript   subscript   x          f  u  d  u       \bar{F}(x):=\Pr[X>x]=\int_{x}^{+\infty}f(u)\,du     is the complementary cumulative distribution function (also called survival function ). The concept is named after John P. Mills . The Mills ratio is related 2 to the hazard rate  h ( x ) which is defined as       h   (  x  )    :=    lim   δ  →  0      1  δ    Pr   [   x   <   X  ≤   x  +  δ    |  X  >   x   ]         assign    h  x     subscript    normal-→  δ  0        1  δ    Pr    x   inner-product    X    x  δ    X   x        h(x):=\lim_{\delta\to 0}\frac{1}{\delta}\Pr[x x]     by        m   (  x  )    =   1   h   (  x  )      .        m  x     1    h  x      m(x)=\frac{1}{h(x)}.     Example  If   X   X   X   has standard normal distribution then        m   (  x  )    ∼   1  /  x    ,     similar-to    m  x     1  x     m(x)\sim 1/x,\,   where the sign   ∼   similar-to   \sim   means that the quotient of the two functions converges to 1 as    x  →   +  ∞      normal-→  x        x\to+\infty   . More precise asymptotics can be given. 3  See also   Inverse Mills ratio   References  External links     "  Category:Theory of probability distributions
