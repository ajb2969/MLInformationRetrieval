   Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence      Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence   In mathematics, Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence allows one to study Lie groups , which are geometric objects, in terms of Lie algebras , which are linear objects. In this article, a Lie group refers to a real Lie group. For the complex and p -adic cases, see complex Lie group and p -adic Lie group .  In this article, manifolds (in particular Lie groups) are assumed to be second countable ; in particular, they have at most countably many connected components.  Basics  Given a Lie group  G , let    Lie   (  G  )      Lie  G    \operatorname{Lie}(G)   be its associated Lie algebra—the Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra of vector fields on G that consists of vector fields X that are invariant under left translations; that is, for any g , h in G ,         (   d   l  g    )   h    (   X  h   )    =   X   g  h           subscript    d   subscript  l  g    h    subscript  X  h     subscript  X    g  h      (dl_{g})_{h}(X_{h})=X_{gh}   where     l  g   :    G  →  G   ,   x  ↦   g  x        normal-:   subscript  l  g    formulae-sequence   normal-→  G  G    maps-to  x    g  x       l_{g}:G\to G,x\mapsto gx   and      (   d   l  g    )   h   :     T  h   G   →    T   g  h    G       normal-:   subscript    d   subscript  l  g    h    normal-→     subscript  T  h   G      subscript  T    g  h    G      (dl_{g})_{h}:T_{h}G\to T_{gh}G   is the differential of    l  g     subscript  l  g    l_{g}   between tangent spaces. 1 The left-invariance amounts to the fact that the vector bundle map over G      ϕ  :    G  ×   Lie   (  G  )     →   T  G       normal-:  ϕ   normal-→    G   Lie  G      T  G      \phi:G\times\operatorname{Lie}(G)\to TG   given by      ϕ  g    (  X  )    =   X  g          subscript  ϕ  g   X    subscript  X  g     \phi_{g}(X)=X_{g}   is an isomorphism (note φ makes    T  G      T  G    TG   a Lie group). It follows that the canonical map        Lie   (  G  )    →    T  e   G    ,   X  ↦   X  e       formulae-sequence   normal-→   Lie  G      subscript  T  e   G     maps-to  X   subscript  X  e      \operatorname{Lie}(G)\to T_{e}G,\,X\mapsto X_{e}   is an isomorphism of vector spaces and one usually identifies    Lie   (  G  )      Lie  G    \operatorname{Lie}(G)   with     T  e   G       subscript  T  e   G    T_{e}G   . (There is also a third incarnation of    Lie   (  G  )      Lie  G    \operatorname{Lie}(G)   ; see "related constructions" below.) In particular, the dimension of G as a real manifold is the dimension of the vector space    Lie   (  G  )      Lie  G    \operatorname{Lie}(G)   , and     Lie   (  G  )    =   Lie   (   G  0   )         Lie  G    Lie   superscript  G  0      \operatorname{Lie}(G)=\operatorname{Lie}(G^{0})   where    G  0     superscript  G  0    G^{0}   is the connected component of the identity element.  If      f  :   G  →  H      normal-:  f   normal-→  G  H     f:G\to H   is a Lie group homomorphism , then its differential at the identity element        d  f   =   d   f  e     :    Lie   (  G  )    →   Lie   (  H  )        normal-:      d  f     d   subscript  f  e      normal-→   Lie  G    Lie  H      df=df_{e}:\operatorname{Lie}(G)\to\operatorname{Lie}(H)   is a Lie algebra homomorphism (brackets go to brackets), which has the following properties:        Lie   (   ker   (  f  )    )    =   ker   (   d  f   )         Lie   ker  f     ker    d  f      \operatorname{Lie}(\operatorname{ker}(f))=\operatorname{ker}(df)   . 2  If the image of f is closed, 3 then     Lie   (   im   (  f  )    )    =   im   (   d  f   )         Lie   im  f     im    d  f      \operatorname{Lie}(\operatorname{im}(f))=\operatorname{im}(df)    4 and the first isomorphism theorem holds: f induces the isomorphism of Lie groups:          G  /   ker   (  f  )     →   im   (  f  )       normal-→    G   ker  f     im  f     G/\operatorname{ker}(f)\to\operatorname{im}(f)   .      The product rule holds: if     f  ,  g   :   G  →  H      normal-:   f  g    normal-→  G  H     f,g:G\to H   are Lie group homomorphisms, then      d   (   f  g   )    (  X  )    =    d  f   (  X  )    +   d  g   (  X  )      .        d    f  g   X       d  f  X     d  g  X      d(fg)(X)=df(X)+dg(X).     The chain rule holds: if    f  :   G  →  H      normal-:  f   normal-→  G  H     f:G\to H   and    g  :   H  →  K      normal-:  g   normal-→  H  K     g:H\to K   are Lie group homomorphisms, then      d   (   g  ∘  f   )    =    (   d  g   )   ∘   (   d  f   )     .        d    g  f        d  g     d  f      d(g\circ f)=(dg)\circ(df).     The differential of the (multiplicative) inverse is the additive inverse    d   (  g  ↦   g   -  1    )    (  X  )   =  -  X  .     fragments  d   fragments  normal-(  g  maps-to   superscript  g    1    normal-)    fragments  normal-(  X  normal-)     X  normal-.    d(g\mapsto g^{-1})(X)=-X.      In particular, if H is a Lie subgroup (i.e., a closed subgroup 5 ) of a Lie group G , then    Lie   (  H  )      Lie  H    \operatorname{Lie}(H)   is a Lie subalgebra of    Lie   (  G  )      Lie  G    \operatorname{Lie}(G)   . Also, if f is injective, then f is an immersion and so G is said to be an immersed (Lie) subgroup of H . For example,    G  /   ker   (  f  )        G   ker  f     G/\operatorname{ker}(f)   is an immersed subgroup of H . If f is surjective, then f is a submersion and if, in addition, G is compact, then f is a principal bundle with the structure group its kernel. ( Ehresmann's lemma )  Let    G  =    G  1   ×  ⋯  ×   G  r        G     subscript  G  1   normal-⋯   subscript  G  r      G=G_{1}\times\cdots\times G_{r}   be a direct product of Lie groups and     p  i   :   G  →   G  i       normal-:   subscript  p  i    normal-→  G   subscript  G  i      p_{i}:G\to G_{i}   projections. Then the differentials     d   p  i    :    Lie   (  G  )    →   Lie   (   G  i   )        normal-:    d   subscript  p  i     normal-→   Lie  G    Lie   subscript  G  i       dp_{i}:\operatorname{Lie}(G)\to\operatorname{Lie}(G_{i})   give the canonical identification:       Lie   (    G  1   ×  ⋯  ×   G  r    )    =    Lie   (   G  1   )    ⊕  ⋯  ⊕   Lie   (   G  r   )          Lie     subscript  G  1   normal-⋯   subscript  G  r      direct-sum   Lie   subscript  G  1    normal-⋯   Lie   subscript  G  r       \operatorname{Lie}(G_{1}\times\cdots\times G_{r})=\operatorname{Lie}(G_{1})%
 \oplus\cdots\oplus\operatorname{Lie}(G_{r})   .  If    H  ,   H  ′      H   superscript  H  normal-′     H,H^{\prime}   are Lie subgroups of a Lie group, then      Lie   (   H  ∩   H  ′    )    =    Lie   (  H  )    ∩   Lie   (   H  ′   )      .       Lie    H   superscript  H  normal-′        Lie  H    Lie   superscript  H  normal-′       \operatorname{Lie}(H\cap H^{\prime})=\operatorname{Lie}(H)\cap\operatorname{%
 Lie}(H^{\prime}).     Let G be a connected Lie group. If H is a Lie group, then any Lie group homomorphism    f  :   G  →  H      normal-:  f   normal-→  G  H     f:G\to H   is uniquely determined by its differential    d  f      d  f    df   . Precisely, there is the exponential map     exp  :    Lie   (  G  )    →  G      normal-:  exp   normal-→   Lie  G   G     \operatorname{exp}:\operatorname{Lie}(G)\to G   (and one for H ) such that     f   (   exp   (  X  )    )    =   exp   (   d  f   (  X  )    )          f   exp  X     exp    d  f  X      f(\operatorname{exp}(X))=\operatorname{exp}(df(X))   and, since G is connected, this determines f uniquely. 6 For example, if G is the Lie group of invertible real square matrices of size n ( general linear group ), then    Lie   (  G  )      Lie  G    \operatorname{Lie}(G)   is the Lie algebra of real square matrices of size n and     exp   (  X  )    =   e  X   =     ∑  0  ∞      X  j   /   j  !             X    superscript  e  X          superscript   subscript   0        superscript  X  j     j        \displaystyle\exp(X)=e^{X}=\sum_{0}^{\infty}{X^{j}/j!}   .  The next criterion is frequently used to compute the Lie algebra of a given Lie group. Let G be a Lie group and H an immersed subgroup. Then        Lie   (  H  )    =   {   X  ∈   Lie   (  G  )     |    exp   (   t  X   )    ∈   H  for all  t  in  ℝ    }    .       Lie  H    conditional-set    X   Lie  G       exp    t  X      H  for all  t  in  ℝ       \operatorname{Lie}(H)=\{X\in\operatorname{Lie}(G)|\operatorname{exp}(tX)\in H%
 \text{ for all }t\text{ in }\mathbb{\mathbb{R}}\}.    7 For example, one can use the criterion to establish the correspondence for classical compact groups (cf. the table in "compact Lie groups" below.)     Lie   Lie   \operatorname{Lie}   defines a functor from the category of Lie groups to the category of finite-dimensional real Lie algebras. Lie's third theorem states that   Lie   Lie   \operatorname{Lie}   defines an equivalence from the subcategory of simply connected Lie groups to the category of finite-dimensional real Lie algebras. Explicitly, the theorem contains the following two statements:   Every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of some simply connected Lie group.  If    ϕ  :    Lie   (  G  )    →   Lie   (  H  )        normal-:  ϕ   normal-→   Lie  G    Lie  H      \phi:\operatorname{Lie}(G)\to\operatorname{Lie}(H)   is a Lie algebra homomorphism and if G is simply connected, then there exists a (unique) Lie group homomorphism    f  :   G  →  H      normal-:  f   normal-→  G  H     f:G\to H   such that    ϕ  =   d  f       ϕ    d  f     \phi=df   .   Of two, the first one is fundamental since the second follows from the first applied to the graph of a Lie algebra homomorphism.  Perhaps, the most elegant proof of the theorem uses Ado's theorem , which says any finite-dimensional Lie algebra (over a field of any characteristic) is a Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra    𝔤   𝔩  n       𝔤   subscript  𝔩  n     \mathfrak{gl}_{n}   of square matrices. The proof goes as follows: by Ado's theorem, we assume    𝔤  ⊂   𝔤   𝔩  n    (  ℝ  )    =   Lie   (   G   L  n    (  ℝ  )    )          𝔤    𝔤   subscript  𝔩  n   ℝ         Lie    G   subscript  L  n   ℝ       \mathfrak{g}\subset\mathfrak{gl}_{n}(\mathbb{R})=\operatorname{Lie}(GL_{n}(%
 \mathbb{R}))   is a Lie subalgebra. Let G be the subgroup of    G   L  n    (  ℝ  )       G   subscript  L  n   ℝ    GL_{n}(\mathbb{R})   generated by    e  𝔤     superscript  e  𝔤    e^{\mathfrak{g}}   and let    G  ~     normal-~  G    \widetilde{G}   be a simply connected covering of G ; it is not hard to show that    G  ~     normal-~  G    \widetilde{G}   is a Lie group and that the covering map is a Lie group homomorphism. Since      T  e    G  ~    =    T  e   G   =  𝔤           subscript  T  e    normal-~  G       subscript  T  e   G        𝔤     T_{e}\widetilde{G}=T_{e}G=\mathfrak{g}   , this completes the proof.  Example: Each element X in the Lie algebra    𝔤  =   Lie   (  G  )        𝔤   Lie  G     \mathfrak{g}=\operatorname{Lie}(G)   gives rise to the Lie algebra homomorphism        ℝ  →  𝔤   ,   t  ↦   t  X     .     formulae-sequence   normal-→  ℝ  𝔤    maps-to  t    t  X      \mathbb{R}\to\mathfrak{g},\,t\mapsto tX.   By Lie's third theorem, as     Lie   (  ℝ  )    =    T  0   ℝ   =  ℝ         Lie  ℝ      subscript  T  0   ℝ        ℝ     \operatorname{Lie}(\mathbb{R})=T_{0}\mathbb{R}=\mathbb{R}   and exp for it is the identity, this homomorphism is the differential of the Lie group homomorphism    ℝ  →  H     normal-→  ℝ  H    \mathbb{R}\to H   for some immersed subgroup H of G . This Lie group homomorphism, called the one-parameter subgroup generated by X , is precisely the exponential map    t  ↦   exp   (   t  X   )       maps-to  t   exp    t  X      t\mapsto\operatorname{exp}(tX)   and H its image. The preceding can be summarized to saying that there is a canonical bijective correspondence between   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   and the set of one-parameter subgroups of G .  Lie group representations  A special case of Lie correspondence is a correspondence between finite-dimensional representations of a Lie group and representations of the associated Lie algebra.  The general linear group    G   L  n    (  ℂ  )       G   subscript  L  n   ℂ    GL_{n}(\mathbb{C})   is a Lie group and a Lie group homomorphism    π  :   G  →   G   L  n    (  ℂ  )        normal-:  π   normal-→  G    G   subscript  L  n   ℂ      \pi:G\to GL_{n}(\mathbb{C})   is called a representation of a Lie group G . The differential     d  π   :   𝔤  →   𝔤   𝔩  n    (  ℂ  )        normal-:    d  π    normal-→  𝔤    𝔤   subscript  𝔩  n   ℂ      d\pi:\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{gl}_{n}(\mathbb{C})   , denoted often simply by   π   π   \pi   , is then a Lie algebra homomorphism called a Lie algebra representation .  Since the exponential map for the general linear group is    e  X     superscript  e  X    e^{X}   , for any Lie group representation π we have       π   (   exp   (  X  )    )    =   I  +   π   (  X  )    +    π    (  X  )   2     2  !    +    π    (  X  )   3     3  !    +  …         π    X      I    π  X       π   superscript  X  2      2        π   superscript  X  3      3    normal-…     \pi(\exp(X))=I+\pi(X)+{\pi(X)^{2}\over 2!}+{\pi(X)^{3}\over 3!}+\dots     An important special case of a Lie group representation is the adjoint representation of a Lie group G ; each element g in a Lie group G defines an automorphism of G by conjugation      c  g    (  h  )    =   g  h   g   -  1            subscript  c  g   h     g  h   superscript  g    1       c_{g}(h)=ghg^{-1}   ; the differential    d   c  g       d   subscript  c  g     dc_{g}   is then an automorphism of the Lie algebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . This way, we get a representation    Ad  :    G  →   G  L   (  𝔤  )     ,   g  ↦   d   c  g         normal-:  Ad   formulae-sequence   normal-→  G    G  L  𝔤     maps-to  g    d   subscript  c  g        \operatorname{Ad}:G\to GL(\mathfrak{g}),\,g\mapsto dc_{g}   , called the adjoint representation. The corresponding Lie algebra homomorphism    𝔤  →   𝔤  𝔩   (  𝔤  )       normal-→  𝔤    𝔤  𝔩  𝔤     \mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{gl}(\mathfrak{g})   is called the adjoint representation of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   and is denoted by   ad   ad   \operatorname{ad}   . One can show      ad   (  X  )     (  Y  )    =   [  X  ,  Y  ]         ad  X   Y    X  Y     \operatorname{ad}(X)(Y)=[X,Y]   , which in particular implies that the Lie bracket of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is determined by the group law on G .  By Lie's third theorem, there exists a subgroup    Int   (  𝔤  )      Int  𝔤    \operatorname{Int}(\mathfrak{g})   of    G  L   (  𝔤  )       G  L  𝔤    GL(\mathfrak{g})   whose Lie algebra is    ad   (  𝔤  )      ad  𝔤    \operatorname{ad}(\mathfrak{g})   . (    Int   (  𝔤  )      Int  𝔤    \operatorname{Int}(\mathfrak{g})   is in general not a closed subgroup; only an immersed subgroup.) It is called the adjoint group of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . 8 If G is connected, it fits into the exact sequence:      0  →   Z   (  G  )    →   G   →  Ad    Int   (  𝔤  )     →  0       normal-→  0    Z  G     normal-→      G   Ad  normal-→    Int  𝔤      normal-→    0     0\to Z(G)\to G\overset{\operatorname{Ad}}{\to}\operatorname{Int}(\mathfrak{g})\to
 0   where    Z   (  G  )       Z  G    Z(G)   is the center of G . If the center of G is discrete, then Ad here is a covering map.  Let G be a connected Lie group. Then G is unimodular if and only if     det   (   Ad   (  g  )    )    =  1       det   Ad  g    1    \operatorname{det}(\operatorname{Ad}(g))=1   for all g in G . 9  Let G be a Lie group acting on a manifold X and G x the stabilizer of a point x in X . Let     ρ   (  x  )    :    G  →  X   ,   g  ↦   g  ⋅  x        normal-:    ρ  x    formulae-sequence   normal-→  G  X    maps-to  g   normal-⋅  g  x       \rho(x):G\to X,\,g\mapsto g\cdot x   . Then        Lie   (   G  x   )    =   ker   (    d  ρ   (  x  )    :     T  e   G   →    T  x   X     )         Lie   subscript  G  x     ker   normal-:    d  ρ  x    normal-→     subscript  T  e   G      subscript  T  x   X        \operatorname{Lie}(G_{x})=\operatorname{ker}(d\rho(x):T_{e}G\to T_{x}X)   .  If the orbit    G  ⋅  x     normal-⋅  G  x    G\cdot x   is locally closed, then the orbit is a submanifold of X and      T  x    (   G  ⋅  x   )    =   im   (    d  ρ   (  x  )    :     T  e   G   →    T  x   X     )           subscript  T  x    normal-⋅  G  x     im   normal-:    d  ρ  x    normal-→     subscript  T  e   G      subscript  T  x   X        T_{x}(G\cdot x)=\operatorname{im}(d\rho(x):T_{e}G\to T_{x}X)   . 10   For a subset A of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   or G , let        𝔷  𝔤    (  A  )    =   {   X  ∈  𝔤   |     ad   (  a  )    X   =   0  or    Ad   (  a  )    X    =   0  for all  a  in  A    }          subscript  𝔷  𝔤   A    conditional-set    X  𝔤         ad  a   X     0  or    Ad  a   X           0  for all  a  in  A        \mathfrak{z}_{\mathfrak{g}}(A)=\{X\in\mathfrak{g}|\operatorname{ad}(a)X=0\text%

Then     Lie   (    Z  G    (  A  )    )    =    𝔷  𝔤    (  A  )         Lie     subscript  Z  G   A       subscript  𝔷  𝔤   A     \operatorname{Lie}(Z_{G}(A))=\mathfrak{z}_{\mathfrak{g}}(A)   .  If H is a closed connected subgroup of G , then H is normal if and only if    Lie   (  H  )      Lie  H    \operatorname{Lie}(H)   is an ideal and in such a case     Lie   (   G  /  H   )    =    Lie   (  G  )    /   Lie   (  H  )          Lie    G  H       Lie  G    Lie  H      \operatorname{Lie}(G/H)=\operatorname{Lie}(G)/\operatorname{Lie}(H)   .  Abelian Lie groups  Let G be a connected Lie group. Since the Lie algebra of the center of G is the center of the Lie algebra of G (cf. the previous §), G is abelian if and only its Lie algebra is abelian.  If G is abelian, then the exponential map    exp  :   𝔤  →  G      normal-:  exp   normal-→  𝔤  G     \operatorname{exp}:\mathfrak{g}\to G   is a surjective group homomorphism. 11 The kernel of it is a discrete group (since the dimension is zero) called the integer lattice of G and is denoted by   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   . By the first isomorphism theorem,   exp   exp   \operatorname{exp}   induces the isomorphism     𝔤  /  Γ   →  G     normal-→    𝔤  normal-Γ   G    \mathfrak{g}/\Gamma\to G   .  By the rigidity argument , the fundamental group      π  1    (  G  )        subscript  π  1   G    \pi_{1}(G)   of a connected Lie group G is a central subgroup of a simply connected covering    G  ~     normal-~  G    \widetilde{G}   of G ; in other words, G fits into the central extension      1  →    π  1    (  G  )    →    G  ~    →  𝑝   G   →  1.       normal-→  1     subscript  π  1   G     normal-→       normal-~  G    p  normal-→   G     normal-→    1.     1\to\pi_{1}(G)\to\widetilde{G}\overset{p}{\to}G\to 1.   Equivalently, given a Lie algebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   and a simply connected Lie group    G  ~     normal-~  G    \widetilde{G}   whose Lie algebra is   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   , there is a one-to-one correspondence between quotients of    G  ~     normal-~  G    \widetilde{G}   by discrete central subgroups and connected Lie groups having Lie algebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   .  For the complex case, complex tori are important; see complex Lie group for this topic.  Compact Lie groups  Let G be a connected Lie group with finite center. Then the following are equivalent.   G is compact.  (Weyl) The simply connected covering    G  ~     normal-~  G    \widetilde{G}   of G is compact.  The adjoint group    Int  𝔤     Int  𝔤    \operatorname{Int}\mathfrak{g}   is compact.  There exists an embedding    G  ↪   O   (  n  ,  ℝ  )       normal-↪  G    O   n  ℝ      G\hookrightarrow O(n,\mathbb{R})   as a closed subgroup.  The Killing form on   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is negative definite.  For each X in   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   ,    ad   (  X  )      ad  X    \operatorname{ad}(X)   is diagonalizable and has zero or purely imaginary eigenvalues.  There exists an invariant inner product on   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   .

(Roughly, this is a consequence of the fact that any differential form on G can be made left invariant by the averaging argument.)  Related constructions  Let G be a Lie group. The associated Lie algebra    Lie   (  G  )      Lie  G    \operatorname{Lie}(G)   of G may be alternatively defined as follows. Let    A   (  G  )       A  G    A(G)   be the algebra of distributions on G with support at the identity element with the multiplication given by convolution .    A   (  G  )       A  G    A(G)   is in fact a Hopf algebra . The Lie algebra of G is then    𝔤  =   Lie   (  G  )    =   P   (   A   (  G  )    )          𝔤   Lie  G          P    A  G       \mathfrak{g}=\operatorname{Lie}(G)=P(A(G))   , the Lie algebra of primitive elements in    A   (  G  )       A  G    A(G)   . 12 By the Milnor–Moore theorem , there is the canonical isomorphism     U   (  𝔤  )    =   A   (  G  )          U  𝔤     A  G     U(\mathfrak{g})=A(G)   between the universal enveloping algebra of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   and    A   (  G  )       A  G    A(G)   .
