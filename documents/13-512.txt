   Erdős–Rado theorem      Erdős–Rado theorem   In partition calculus , part of combinatorial set theory , which is a branch of mathematics, the Erdős–Rado theorem is a basic result, extending Ramsey's theorem to uncountable sets.  Statement of the theorem  If r ≥ 0 is finite, κ is an infinite cardinal, then       exp  r     (  κ  )   +   ⟶    (   κ  +   )   κ   r  +  1       fragments   subscript   r    superscript   fragments  normal-(  κ  normal-)     normal-⟶   subscript   superscript   fragments  normal-(   superscript  κ    normal-)     r  1    κ     \exp_{r}(\kappa)^{+}\longrightarrow(\kappa^{+})^{r+1}_{\kappa}   where exp 0 (κ) = κ and inductively exp r +1 (κ)=2 exp r (κ) . This is sharp in the sense that exp r (κ) + cannot be replaced by exp r (κ) on the left hand side.  The above partition symbol describes the following statement. If f is a coloring of the r+1 -element subsets of a set of cardinality exp r (κ) + , in κ many colors, then there is a homogeneous set of cardinality κ + (a set, all whose r+1 -element subsets get the same f -value).
