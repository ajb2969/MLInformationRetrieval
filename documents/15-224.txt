Quantifier rank

In mathematical logic, the quantifier rank of a formula is the depth of nesting of its quantifiers. It plays an essential role in model theory.
Notice that the quantifier rank is a property of the formula itself (i.e. the expression in a language). Thus two logically equivalent formulae can have different quantifier ranks, when they express the same thing in different ways.
Definition
Quantifier Rank of a Formula in First-order language (FO)
Let φ be a FO formula. The quantifier rank of φ, written qr(φ), is defined as



 
 , if φ is atomic.

 .


 
 .

Remarks

We write FO[n] for the set of all first-order formulas φ with 
 
 
 
 .
Relational FO[n] (without function symbols) is always of finite size, i.e. contains a finite number of formulas
Notice that in Prenex normal form the Quantifier Rank of φ is exactly the number of quantifiers appearing in φ.

Quantifier Rank of a higher order Formula

For Fixpoint logic, with a least fix point operator LFP:


qr([LFPφ]y) = 1 + qr( φ)

Examples

A sentence of quantifier rank 2:


∀x∃y R(x, y)



A formula of quantifier rank 1:


∀x R(y, x) ∧ ∃x R(x, y)



A formula of quantifier rank 0:


R(x, y) ∧ x ≠ y



A formula in prenex normal form of quantifier rank 3:


∀x ∃y ∃z ((¬ x = y) ∧ x R y ) ∧ ( (¬ x = z) ∧ z R x ) 



A formula, equivalent to the latter, although of quantifier rank 2:


∀x ( ∃y ((¬ x = y) ∧ x R y ) ) ∧ ( ∃ z ((¬ x = z) ∧ z R x ) )
