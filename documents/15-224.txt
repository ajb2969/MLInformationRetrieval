   Quantifier rank      Quantifier rank   In mathematical logic , the quantifier rank of a formula is the depth of nesting of its quantifiers . It plays an essential role in model theory .  Notice that the quantifier rank is a property of the formula itself (i.e. the expression in a language). Thus two logically equivalent formulae can have different quantifier ranks, when they express the same thing in different ways.  Definition  Quantifier Rank of a Formula in First-order language (FO)  Let φ be a FO formula. The quantifier rank of φ, written qr(φ), is defined as        q  r   (  φ  )    =  0        q  r  φ   0    qr(\varphi)=0   , if φ is atomic.       q  r   (    φ  1   ∧   φ  2    )    =   q  r   (    φ  1   ∨   φ  2    )    =   m  a  x   (   q  r   (   φ  1   )    ,   q  r   (   φ  2   )    )            q  r     subscript  φ  1    subscript  φ  2       q  r     subscript  φ  1    subscript  φ  2            m  a  x     q  r   subscript  φ  1      q  r   subscript  φ  2         qr(\varphi_{1}\land\varphi_{2})=qr(\varphi_{1}\lor\varphi_{2})=max(qr(\varphi_%
 {1}),qr(\varphi_{2}))   .       q  r   (   ¬  φ   )    =   q  r   (  φ  )          q  r     φ      q  r  φ     qr(\lnot\varphi)=qr(\varphi)   .       q  r   (    ∃  x   φ   )    =    q  r   (  φ  )    +  1         q  r    subscript   x   φ        q  r  φ   1     qr(\exists_{x}\varphi)=qr(\varphi)+1   .   Remarks   We write FO[n] for the set of all first-order formulas φ with     q  r   (  φ  )    ≤  n        q  r  φ   n    qr(\varphi)\leq n   .  Relational FO[n] (without function symbols) is always of finite size, i.e. contains a finite number of formulas  Notice that in Prenex normal form the Quantifier Rank of φ is exactly the number of quantifiers appearing in φ.   Quantifier Rank of a higher order Formula   For Fixpoint logic , with a least fix point operator LFP:    qr([LFP φ ]y) = 1 + qr( φ)    ...  Examples   A sentence of quantifier rank 2:    ∀x∃y R(x, y)     A formula of quantifier rank 1:    ∀x R(y, x) ∧ ∃x R(x, y)     A formula of quantifier rank 0:    R(x, y) ∧ x ≠ y     A formula in prenex normal form of quantifier rank 3:    ∀x ∃y ∃z ((¬ x = y) ∧ x R y ) ∧ ( (¬ x = z) ∧ z R x )     A formula, equivalent to the latter, although of quantifier rank 2:    ∀x ( ∃y ((¬ x = y) ∧ x R y ) ) ∧ ( ∃ z ((¬ x = z) ∧ z R x ) )    See also   Prenex normal form  Ehrenfeucht game  Quantifier   References    .   .
