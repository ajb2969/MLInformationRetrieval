Layer cake representation

In mathematics, the layer cake representation of a non-negative, real-valued measurable function f defined on n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn is the formula



where 1E denotes the indicator function of a subset E ⊆ Rn and L(f, t) denotes the super-level set



The layer cake representation follows easily from observing that



and then using the formula



The layer cake representation takes its name from the representation of the value f(x) as the sum of contributions from the "layers" L(f, t): "layers"/values t below f(x) contribute to the integral, while values t above f(x) do not.
