   UDP-galacturonate decarboxylase      UDP-galacturonate decarboxylase   In enzymology , an UDP-galacturonate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-D-galacturonate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP-L-arabinose + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , UDP-D-galacturonate , and two products , UDP-L-arabinose and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-D-galacturonate carboxy-lyase (UDP-L-arabinose-forming) . Other names in common use include UDP-galacturonic acid decarboxylase , UDPGalUA carboxy lyase , and UDP-D-galacturonate carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in nucleotide sugars metabolism .
