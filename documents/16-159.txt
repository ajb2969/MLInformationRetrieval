   Centered icosahedral number      Centered icosahedral number   A centered icosahedral number is a centered  figurate number that represents an icosahedron . The centered icosahedral number for a specific n is given by       (    2  n   +  1   )   Ã—    (    5   n  2    +   5  n   +  3   )   3           2  n   1         5   superscript  n  2      5  n   3   3     (2n+1)\times{(5n^{2}+5n+3)\over 3}     The first such numbers are 1, 13, 55, 147, 309, 561, 923, 1415, 2057, 2869, 3871, 5083, 6525, 8217, â€¦  References    .
