Fluid flow through porous media

Introduction
Many day to day processes involve the movement of fluids across porous medium. For example sponge, drying of wood, filtration of water by using sand and/or other porous materials. As commonly observed, some fluid flows through the media while some mass of the fluid is stored in the pores present in the media. The knowledge of how the fluid diffuses through these materials and what are the factors upon which the diffusion depends is really useful for Engineering practices.
Governing Law
The basic law governing the flow of fluids through porous media is Darcy's Law, which was formulated by the French civil engineer Henry Darcy in 1856 on the basis of his experiments on vertical water filtration through sand beds.1 According to which,


 
 . Where,

 
 = Volumetric flow rate [m3/s]

 
 = Permeability of porous medium[m2]. The permeability is a function of material type, and also varies with stress, temperature, etc.

 
 = Fluid viscosity[Pa.s]

 
 = Cross-sectional area of Porous medium[m2]

 
 = Pressure drop across medium [Pa]

 
 = Length of sample[m]
For transient processes in which the flux varies from point to-point, the following differential form of Darcy’s law is used.

Mass Conservation
Mass conservation of fluid across the porous medium involves the basic principle that,
Mass flux In - Mass flux Out = Increase in amount stored by medium.2 Which means that total mass of the fluid is always conserved.

 In mathematical form, considering a time period from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 ,length of porous medium from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  being the mass stored by the medium.





 
  , where 
 
 
 
  is the pore volume of the medium between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the density. So, 
 
 
 
  Where 
 
 
 
  is the number of pores in the medium.
Dividing both sides by 
 
 
 
 , while

  , For 1-Dimensional linear flow in porous medium:



For 3-Dimensional, equation can be written as 
 
 

 The mathematical operation on the left-hand side of this equation is known as the divergence of 
 
 
 
 ; it represents the rate at which fluid diverges from a given region, per unit volume.
Diffusion Equation
Using product rule(and chain rule) on right hand side of the above mass conservation equation (i),




 Where, 
 
 
 
  = compressibility of the fluid and 
 
 
 
  = compressibility of porous medium.3

Sand

10−7 - 10−9

 Now considering the left hand side of the mass conservation equation, which is given by Darcy's Law as




 Equating the results obtained in 
 
 
 
  & 
 
 
 
 , we get
 
 

 .
The second term on the left side is usually negligible , So we obtain the diffusion equation in 1-Dimension as 
 
 
 
  Where
