   Ample line bundle      Ample line bundle   In algebraic geometry , a very ample line bundle is one with enough global sections to set up an embedding of its base variety or manifold    M   M   M   into projective space . An ample line bundle is one such that some positive power is very ample. Globally generated sheaves are those with enough sections to define a morphism to projective space.  Introduction  Inverse image of line bundle and hyperplane divisors  Given a morphism    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f\colon X\to Y   , any vector bundle    ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   on Y , or more generally any sheaf in    𝒪  Y     subscript  𝒪  Y    \mathcal{O}_{Y}   modules, e.g. a coherent sheaf , can be pulled back to X , (see Inverse image functor ). This construction preserves the condition of being a line bundle , and more generally the rank.  The notions described in this article are related to this construction in the case of morphisms to projective spaces       f  :   X  →   ℙ  N     ,     normal-:  f   normal-→  X   superscript  ℙ  N      f\colon X\to\mathbb{P}^{N},   and    ℱ  =   𝒪   (  1  )    ∈   Pic   (   ℙ  N   )          ℱ    𝒪  1          Pic   superscript  ℙ  N       \mathcal{F}=\mathcal{O}(1)\in\mathrm{Pic}(\mathbb{P}^{N})   , the line bundle corresponding to the hyperplane divisor , whose sections are the 1-homogeneous regular functions. See Algebraic geometry of projective spaces#Divisors and twisting sheaves .  Sheaves generated by their global sections  Let X be a scheme or a complex manifold and F a sheaf on X . One says that F is generated by (finitely many) global sections      a  i   ∈   F   (  X  )         subscript  a  i     F  X     a_{i}\in F(X)   , if every stalk of F is generated as a module over the stalk of the structure sheaf by the germs of the a i . For example, if F happens to be a line bundle, i.e. locally free of rank 1, this amounts to having finitely many global sections , such that for any point x in X , there is at least one section not vanishing at this point. In this case a choice of such global generators a 0 , ..., a n gives a morphism      f  :  X  →   ℙ  n   ,  x  ↦   [   a  0    (  x  )   :  ⋯  :   a  n    (  x  )   ]   ,     fragments  f  normal-:  X  normal-→   superscript  ℙ  n   normal-,  x  maps-to   fragments  normal-[   subscript  a  0    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-:  normal-⋯  normal-:   subscript  a  n    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-]   normal-,    f\colon X\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^{n},\ x\mapsto[a_{0}(x):\cdots:a_{n}(x)],   such that the pullback f *( O (1)) is F (Note that this evaluation makes sense when F is a subsheaf of the constant sheaf of rational functions on X ). The converse statement is also true: given such a morphism f , the pullback of O (1) is generated by its global sections (on X ).  More generally, a sheaf generated by global sections is a sheaf  F on a locally ringed space  X , with structure sheaf O X that is of a rather simple type. Assume F is a sheaf of abelian groups . Then it is asserted that if A is the abelian group of global sections , i.e.      A  =   Γ   (  F  ,  X  )        A    normal-Γ   F  X      A=\Gamma(F,X)     then for any open set  U of X , ρ( A ) spans F ( U ) as an O U -module. Here      ρ  =   ρ   X  ,  U        ρ   subscript  ρ   X  U      \rho=\rho_{X,U}     is the restriction map. In words, all sections of F are locally generated by the global sections.  An example of such a sheaf is that associated in algebraic geometry to an R -module M , R being any commutative ring , on the spectrum of a ring  Spec ( R ). Another example: according to Cartan's theorem A , any coherent sheaf on a Stein manifold is spanned by global sections.  Very ample line bundles  Given a scheme  X over a base scheme S or a complex manifold, a line bundle (or in other words an invertible sheaf , that is, a locally free sheaf of rank one) L on X is said to be very ample , if there is an embedding ''i : X → ' 'P n S , the n -dimensional projective space over S for some n , such that the pullback of the standard twisting sheaf  O (1) on P n S is isomorphic to L :         i  *    (   𝒪   (  1  )    )    ≅  L   .         superscript  i      𝒪  1    L    i^{*}(\mathcal{O}(1))\cong L.     Hence this notion is a special case of the previous one, namely a line bundle is very ample if it is globally generated and the morphism given by some global generators is an embedding.  Given a very ample sheaf L on X and a coherent sheaf  F , a theorem of Serre shows that (the coherent sheaf) F ⊗ L ⊗n is generated by finitely many global sections for sufficiently large n . This in turn implies that global sections and higher (Zariski) cohomology groups     H  i    (  X  ,  F  )        superscript  H  i    X  F     H^{i}(X,F)   are finitely generated. This is a distinctive feature of the projective situation. For example, for the affine n -space A n k over a field k , global sections of the structure sheaf  O are polynomials in n variables, thus not a finitely generated k -vector space, whereas for P n k , global sections are just constant functions, a one-dimensional k -vector space.  Definitions  The notion of ample line bundles  L is slightly weaker than very ample line bundles: a line bundle L is ample if for any coherent sheaf F on X , there exists an integer n(F) , such that F ⊗ L ⊗ n is generated by its global sections for n > n(F) .  An equivalent, maybe more intuitive, definition of the ampleness of the line bundle   ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   is its having a positive tensorial power that is very ample. In other words, for    n  ≫  0     much-greater-than  n  0    n\gg 0   there exists a projective embedding     j  :   X  →   ℙ  N       normal-:  j   normal-→  X   superscript  ℙ  N      j:X\to\mathbb{P}^{N}   such that     ℒ    ⊗  n    =    j  *    (   𝒪   (  1  )    )         superscript  ℒ   tensor-product  absent  n       superscript  j      𝒪  1      \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n}=j^{*}(\mathcal{O}(1))   , that is the zero divisors of global sections of    ℒ    ⊗  n      superscript  ℒ   tensor-product  absent  n     \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n}   are hyperplane sections.  This definition makes sense for the underlying divisors ( Cartier divisors )   D   D   D   ; an ample   D   D   D   is one where    n  D      n  D    nD    moves in a large enough linear system . Such divisors form a cone in all divisors of those that are, in some sense, positive enough . The relationship with projective space is that the   D   D   D   for a very ample   L   L   L   corresponds to the hyperplane sections (intersection with some hyperplane ) of the embedded   M   M   M   .  The equivalence between the two definitions is credited to Jean-Pierre Serre in Faisceaux algébriques cohérents .  Criteria for ampleness of line bundles  Intersection theory  To decide in practice when a Cartier divisor  D corresponds to an ample line bundle, there are some geometric criteria.  For curves, a divisor D is very ample if and only if l ( D ) = 2 + l ( D − A − B ) whenever A and B are points. By the Riemann–Roch theorem every divisor of degree at least 2 g + 1 satisfies this condition so is very ample. This implies that a divisor is ample if and only if it has positive degree. The canonical divisor of degree 2 g − 2 is very ample if and only if the curve is not a hyperelliptic curve .  The Nakai–Moishezon criterion (, ) states that a Cartier divisor D on a proper scheme X over an algebraically closed field is ample if and only if D dim( Y ) . Y > 0 for every closed integral subscheme  Y of X . In the special case of curves this says that a divisor is ample if and only if it has positive degree, and for a smooth projective algebraic surface  S , the Nakai–Moishezon criterion states that D is ample if and only if its self-intersection number  D . D is strictly positive, and for any irreducible curve C on S we have D . C > 0.  The Kleiman condition states that for any projective scheme X , a divisor D on X is ample if and only if D . C > 0 for any nonzero element C in the closure of NE( X ), the cone of curves of X . In other words a divisor is ample if and only if it is in the interior of the real cone generated by nef divisors .  constructed divisors on surfaces that have positive intersection with every curve, but are not ample. This shows that the condition D . D > 0 cannot be omitted in the Nakai–Moishezon criterion, and it is necessary to use the closure of NE( X ) rather than NE( X ) in the Kleiman condition.  showed that a line bundle L on a complete algebraic scheme is ample if and only if there is some positive ε such that deg( L | C ) ≥ ε m ( C ) for all integral curves C in X , where m ( C ) is the maximum of the multiplicities at the points of C .  Sheaf cohomology  The theorem of Cartan - Serre - Grothendieck states that for a line bundle   ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   on a variety   X   X   X   , the following conditions are equivalent:      ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   is ample  for m big enough,    ℒ    ⊗  m      superscript  ℒ   tensor-product  absent  m     \mathcal{L}^{\otimes m}   is very ample  for any coherent sheaf   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   on X , the sheaf    ℱ  ⊗   ℒ    ⊗  m       tensor-product  ℱ   superscript  ℒ   tensor-product  absent  m      \mathcal{F}\otimes\mathcal{L}^{\otimes m}   is generated by global sections, for m big enough   If   X   X   X   is proper over some noetherian ring, this is also equivalent to:   for any coherent sheaf   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   on X , the higher cohomology groups        H  i    (  X  ,   ℱ  ⊗   ℒ    ⊗  m     )    ,  i   ≥  1          superscript  H  i    X   tensor-product  ℱ   superscript  ℒ   tensor-product  absent  m       i   1    H^{i}(X,\mathcal{F}\otimes\mathcal{L}^{\otimes m}),\ i\geq 1   vanish for m big enough.   Generalizations  Vector bundles of higher rank  A locally free sheaf ( vector bundle )   F   F   F   on a variety is called ample if the invertible sheaf     𝒪   (  1  )       𝒪  1    \mathcal{O}(1)   on    ℙ   (  F  )       ℙ  F    \mathbb{P}(F)   is ample .  Ample vector bundles inherit many of the properties of ample line bundles.  Big line bundles  An important generalization, notably in birational geometry , is that of a big line bundle . A line bundle   ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   on X is said to be big if the equivalent following conditions are satisfied:      ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   is the tensor product of an ample line bundle and an effective line bundle  the Hilbert polynomial of the finitely generated graded ring      ⊕   k  =  0   ∞    Γ   (  X  ,   ℒ    ⊗  k    )        superscript   subscript  direct-sum    k  0        normal-Γ   X   superscript  ℒ   tensor-product  absent  k        \bigoplus_{k=0}^{\infty}\Gamma(X,\mathcal{L}^{\otimes k})   has degree the dimension of X  the rational mapping of the total system of divisors     X  →   ℙ  Γ   (  X  ,   ℒ    ⊗  k    )       normal-→  X    ℙ  normal-Γ   X   superscript  ℒ   tensor-product  absent  k        X\to\mathbb{P}\Gamma(X,\mathcal{L}^{\otimes k})   is birational on its image for    k  ≫  0     much-greater-than  k  0    k\gg 0   .   The interest of this notion is its stability with respect to rational transformations.
