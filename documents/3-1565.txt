   Arima Yoriyuki      Arima Yoriyuki   was a Japanese  mathematician of the Edo period . He was the lord of Kurume Domain and approximated the value of   π   π   \pi   and its square ,    π  2     superscript  π  2    \pi^{2}   . In 1766, he found the following rational approximation of pi, correct to 29 digits: 1 2      π  ≈   428224593349304  136308121570117   =   3.14159265358979323846264338327   (  569...  )          π    428224593349304  136308121570117          3.14159265358979323846264338327  569...      \pi\approx\frac{428224593349304}{136308121570117}=3.14159265358979323846264338%
