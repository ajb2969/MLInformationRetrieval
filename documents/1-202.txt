   Convex set      Convex set     In Euclidean space , a convex set is the region such that, for every pair of points within the region, every point on the straight line segment that joins the pair of points is also within the region. For example, a solid cube is a convex set, but anything that is hollow or has a dent in it, for example, a crescent shape, is not convex. A convex curve forms the boundary of a convex set.  The notion of a convex set can be generalized to other spaces as described below.  In vector spaces  Let   S   S   S   be a vector space over the real numbers , or, more generally, some ordered field . This includes Euclidean spaces. A set    C   C   C   in   S   S   S   is said to be convex if, for all   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   in   C   C   C   and all   t   t   t   in the interval     0  ,  11     0  11    0,11   , the point      (   1  −  t   )   x   +   t  y           1  normal-−  t   x     t  y     (1−t)x+ty   also belongs to   C   C   C   . In other words, every point on the line segment connecting   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   is in   C   C   C   . This implies that a convex set in a real or complex  topological vector space is path-connected , thus connected . Furthermore,   C   C   C   is strictly convex if every point on the line segment connecting   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   other than the endpoints is inside the interior of   C   C   C   .  A set   C   C   C   is called absolutely convex if it is convex and balanced .  The convex subsets of   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   (the set of real numbers) are simply the intervals of   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   . Some examples of convex subsets of the Euclidean plane are solid regular polygons , solid triangles, and intersections of solid triangles. Some examples of convex subsets of a Euclidean 3-dimensional space are the Archimedean solids and the Platonic solids . The Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra are examples of non-convex sets.  Non-convex set   ''"Concave set" redirects here.   A set that is not convex is called a non-convex set . A polygon that is not a convex polygon is sometimes called a concave polygon , 1 and some sources more generally use the term concave set to mean a non-convex set, 2 but most authorities prohibit this usage. 3 4  Properties  If   S   S   S   is a convex set in   n   n   n   -dimensional space, then for any collection of   r   r   r   ,    r  >  1      r  1    r>1   ,   n   n   n   -dimensional vectors in   S   S   S   , and for any nonnegative numbers  such that 1}} , then one has:         ∑   k  =  1   r     λ  k    u  k     ∈  S   .        superscript   subscript     k  1    r      subscript  λ  k    subscript  u  k     S    \sum_{k=1}^{r}\lambda_{k}u_{k}\in S.   A vector of this type is known as a convex combination of .  Intersections and unions  The collection of convex subsets of a vector space has the following properties: 5 6   The empty set and the whole vector-space are convex.  The intersection of any collection of convex sets is convex.  The union of a non-decreasing  sequence of convex subsets is a convex set. For the preceding property of unions of non-decreasing sequences of convex sets, the restriction to nested sets is important: The union of two convex sets need not be convex.   Closed convex sets  Closed convex sets are convex sets that contain all their limit points . They can be characterised as the intersections of closed half-spaces (sets of point in space that lie on and to one side of a hyperplane ).  From what has just been said, it is clear that such intersections are convex, and they will also be closed sets. To prove the converse, i.e., every convex set may be represented as such intersection, one needs the supporting hyperplane theorem in the form that for a given closed convex set   C   C   C   and point   P   P   P   outside it, there is a closed half-space   H   H   H   that contains   C   C   C   and not   P   P   P   . The supporting hyperplane theorem is a special case of the Hahn–Banach theorem of functional analysis .  Convex sets and rectangles  Let C be a convex body in the plane. We can inscribe a rectangle r in C such that a homothetic copy R of r is circumscribed about C. The positive homothety ratio is at most 2 and: 7         0.5  A  r  e  a   (  R  )    ≤   A  r  e  a   (  C  )    ≤   2  A  r  e  a   (  r  )            0.5  A  r  e  a  R     A  r  e  a  C          2  A  r  e  a  r      0.5Area(R)\leq Area(C)\leq 2Area(r)        Convex hulls and Minkowski sums  Convex hulls  Every subset   A   A   A   of the vector space is contained within a smallest convex set (called the convex hull of   A   A   A   ), namely the intersection of all convex sets containing   A   A   A   . The convex-hull operator Conv() has the characteristic properties of a hull operator :        extensive       S  ⊆   C  o  n  v   (  S  )       S  normal-⊆  normal-  C  o  n  v  S    S⊆ Conv(S)   ,     non-decreasing       S  ⊆  T      S  normal-⊆  T    S⊆T   implies that    C  o  n  v   (  S  )    ⊆   C  o  n  v   (  T  )       C  o  n  v  S  normal-  normal-⊆  normal-  C  o  n  v  T    Conv(S) ⊆ Conv(T)   , and     idempotent        C  o  n  v   (   C  o  n  v   (  S  )    )    =   C  o  n  v   (  S  )          C  o  n  v    C  o  n  v  S      C  o  n  v  S     Conv(Conv(S))=Conv(S)   .       The convex-hull operation is needed for the set of convex sets to form a lattice , in which the " join " operation is the convex hull of the union of two convex sets        C  o  n  v   (  S  )   ∨  C  o  n  v   (  T  )    =   C  o  n  v   (   S  ∪  T   )    =   C  o  n  v   (   C  o  n  v   (  S  )    ∪   C  o  n  v   (  T  )    )            C  o  n  v  S  normal-∨  C  o  n  v  T     C  o  n  v    S  normal-∪  T           C  o  n  v    C  o  n  v  S  normal-  normal-∪  normal-  C  o  n  v  T       Conv(S)∨Conv(T)=Conv(S∪T)=Conv(Conv(S) ∪ Conv(T))   .   The intersection of any collection of convex sets is itself convex, so the convex subsets of a (real or complex) vector space form a complete lattice .  Minkowski addition  (Figure)  Q 1 {{=}} [0, 1] × [0, 1]}} is green. The square [1, 2] × [1, 2] is brown, and it sits inside the turquoise square Q 1 +Q 2 =[1,3]×[1,3]}} .| Minkowski addition of sets. The sum of the squares Q 1 =[0,1] 2 and Q 2 =[1,2] 2 is the square Q 1 +Q 2 =[1,3] 2 .   In a real vector-space, the Minkowski sum of two (non-empty) sets, and , is defined to be the set  formed by the addition of vectors element-wise from the summand-sets    .    More generally, the Minkowski sum of a finite family of (non-empty) sets is the set formed by element-wise addition of vectors         ∑  n    S  n    =   {    ∑  n    x  n    :    x  n   ∈   S  n    }    .        subscript   n    subscript  S  n     conditional-set    subscript   n    subscript  x  n       subscript  x  n    subscript  S  n       \sum_{n}S_{n}=\left\{\sum_{n}x_{n}:x_{n}\in S_{n}\right\}.     For Minkowski addition, the zero set containing only the zero vector    0   0    has special importance : For every non-empty subset S of a vector space    ;    in algebraic terminology,  is the identity element of Minkowski addition (on the collection of non-empty sets). 8  Convex hulls of Minkowski sums  Minkowski addition behaves well with respect to the operation of taking convex hulls, as shown by the following proposition:  Let be subsets of a real vector-space, the convex hull of their Minkowski sum is the Minkowski sum of their convex hulls   Conv( S 1 ) + Conv( S 2 )}} .   This result holds more generally for each finite collection of non-empty sets:        Conv   (    ∑  n    S  n    )    =    ∑  n    Conv   (   S  n   )      .        Conv    subscript   n    subscript  S  n       subscript   n     Conv   subscript  S  n       \text{Conv}\left(\sum_{n}S_{n}\right)=\sum_{n}\text{Conv}\left(S_{n}\right).     In mathematical terminology, the operations of Minkowski summation and of forming convex hulls are commuting operations. 9 10  Minkowski sums of convex sets  The Minkowski sum of two compact convex sets is compact. the sum of a compact convex set and a closed convex set is closed. 11  Generalizations and extensions for convexity  The notion of convexity in the Euclidean space may be generalized by modifying the definition in some or other aspects. The common name "generalized convexity" is used, because the resulting objects retain certain properties of convex sets.  Star-convex sets  Let   C   C   C   be a set in a real or complex vector space.   C   C   C   is star convex if there exists an in   C   C   C   such that the line segment from to any point   y   y   y   in   C   C   C   is contained in   C   C   C   . Hence a non-empty convex set is always star-convex but a star-convex set is not always convex.  Orthogonal convexity  An example of generalized convexity is orthogonal convexity . 12  A set   S   S   S   in the Euclidean space is called orthogonally convex or ortho-convex , if any segment parallel to any of the coordinate axes connecting two points of   S   S   S   lies totally within   S   S   S   . It is easy to prove that an intersection of any collection of orthoconvex sets is orthoconvex. Some other properties of convex sets are valid as well.  Non-Euclidean geometry  The definition of a convex set and a convex hull extends naturally to geometries which are not Euclidean by defining a geodesically convex set to be one that contains the geodesics joining any two points in the set.  Order topology  Convexity can be extended for a space   X   X   X   endowed with the order topology , using the total order     Y  ⊆  X      Y  normal-⊆  X    Y⊆X     Let   Y   Y   Y   . The subspace    a  ,  b     a  b    a,b   is a convex set if for each pair of points   Y   Y   Y   in   Y   Y   Y   such that   Y   Y   Y     Convexity spaces  The notion of convexity may be generalised to other objects, if certain properties of convexity are selected as axioms .  Given a set   X   X   X   , a convexity over   X   X   X   is a collection   𝒞   normal-𝒞   𝒞   of subsets of   𝒞   normal-𝒞   𝒞   satisfying the following axioms: 14 15 16   The empty set and   𝒞   normal-𝒞   𝒞   are in   𝒞   normal-𝒞   𝒞     The intersection of any collection from   𝒞   normal-𝒞   𝒞   is in   𝒞   normal-𝒞   𝒞   .  The union of a chain (with respect to the inclusion relation ) of elements of    (  X  ,  𝒞  )     X  normal-𝒞    (X,𝒞)   is in   S   S   S   .   The elements of     S  +  ∅   =  ∅        S  normal-∅   normal-∅    S+∅=∅   are called convex sets and the pair $( X , 𝒞 )$ is called a convexity space . For the ordinary convexity, the first two axioms hold, and the third one is trivial.
