   Hitting time      Hitting time   In the study of stochastic processes in mathematics , a hitting time (or first hit time ) is the first time at which a given process "hits" a given subset of the state space. Exit times and return times are also examples of hitting times.  Definitions  Let T be an ordered index set such as the natural numbers , N , the non-negative real numbers , [0, +∞), or a subset of these; elements t ∈ T can be thought of as "times". Given a probability space (Ω, Σ, Pr) and a measurable state space  S , let X : Ω × T → S be a stochastic process , and let A be a measurable subset of the state space S . Then the first hit time  τ A : Ω → [0, +∞] is the random variable defined by         τ  A    (  ω  )    :=   inf   {   t  ∈  T   |     X  t    (  ω  )    ∈  A   }     .     assign     subscript  τ  A   ω    infimum   conditional-set    t  T        subscript  X  t   ω   A       \tau_{A}(\omega):=\inf\{t\in T|X_{t}(\omega)\in A\}.     The first exit time (from A ) is defined to be the first hit time for S \ A , the complement of A in S . Confusingly, this is also often denoted by τ A . 1  The first return time is defined to be the first hit time for the singleton set { X 0 ( ω ) }, which is usually a given deterministic element of the state space, such as the origin of the coordinate system.  Examples   Any stopping time is a hitting time for a properly chosen process and target set. This follows from the converse of the Début theorem (Fischer, 2013).    Let B denote standard Brownian motion on the real line  R starting at the origin. Then the hitting time τ A satisfies the measurability requirements to be a stopping time for every Borel measurable set A ⊆ R .    For B as above, let    τ  r     subscript  τ  r    \tau_{r}   (    r  >  0      r  0    r>0   ) denote the first exit time for the interval (− r , r ), i.e. the first hit time for (−∞, − r ] ∪ [ r , +∞). Then the expected value and variance of    τ  r     subscript  τ  r    \tau_{r}   satisfy         𝔼   [   τ  r   ]    =   r  2    ,        𝔼   delimited-[]   subscript  τ  r      superscript  r  2     \mathbb{E}\left[\tau_{r}\right]=r^{2},           Var   [   τ  r   ]    =    (   2  /  3   )    r  4     .        Var   delimited-[]   subscript  τ  r         2  3    superscript  r  4      \mathrm{Var}\left[\tau_{r}\right]=(2/3)r^{4}.      For B as above, the time of hitting a single point (different from the starting point 0) has the Lévy distribution .   Début theorem  The hitting time of a set F is also known as the début of F . The Début theorem says that the hitting time of a measurable set F , for a progressively measurable process , is a stopping time. Progressively measurable processes include, in particular, all right and left-continuous adapted processes . The proof that the début is measurable is rather involved and involves properties of analytic sets . The theorem requires the underlying probability space to be complete or, at least, universally complete.  The converse of the Début theorem states that every stopping time defined with respect to a filtration over a real-valued time index can be represented by a hitting time. In particular, for essentially any such stopping time there exists an adapted, non-increasing process with càdlàg (RCLL) paths that takes the values 0 and 1 only, such that the hitting time of the set    {  0  }     0    \{0\}   by this process is the considered stopping time. The proof is very simple. 2  See also   Stopping time   References  "  Category:Stochastic processes     ↩  ↩
