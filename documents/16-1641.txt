   Multiscale turbulence      Multiscale turbulence   Multiscale turbulence is a class of turbulent flows in which the chaotic motion of the fluid is forced at different length and/or time scales. 1 2 This is usually achieved by immersing in a moving fluid a body with a multiscale, often fractal -like, arrangement of length scales. This arrangement of scales can be either passive 3 4 or active 5  (Figure)  Three examples of multiscale turbulence generators.

As turbulent flows contain eddies with a wide range of scales, exciting the turbulence at particular scales (or range of scales) allows one to fine-tune the properties of that flow. Multiscale turbulent flows have been successfully applied in different fields., 6 such as:   Reducing acoustic noise from wings by modifying the geometry of spoilers ; 7  Enhancing heat transfer from impinging jets passing through grids; 8  Reducing the vortex shedding intensity of flows past normal plates without changing the shedding  frequency ; 9  Enhancing mixing by energy-efficient stirring; 10 11  Improving flow metering and flow conditioning in pipes; 12  Improving combustion. 13 14   In 2013 the EU awarded a Marie Curie grant of 3.8M Euros for research and training of 13 young scientists and engineers in multiscale turbulence in order to further explore and apply the properties of these flows 15 16  Multiscale turbulence has also played an important role into probing the internal structure of turbulence . 17 This sort of turbulence allowed researchers to unveil a novel dissipation  law in which the parameter    C  œµ     subscript  C  œµ    C_{\epsilon}   in      Œµ  =    C  Œµ     ùí∞  3   ‚Ñí        Œµ     subscript  C  Œµ      superscript  ùí∞  3   ‚Ñí      \varepsilon=C_{\varepsilon}\frac{\mathcal{U}^{3}}{\mathcal{L}}     is not constant, as required by the Richardson - Kolmogorov  energy cascade . This new law . 18 can be expressed as     C  œµ   ‚àù    R   e  I  m     R   e  L  n        proportional-to   subscript  C  œµ       R   superscript   subscript  e  I   m      R   superscript   subscript  e  L   n       C_{\epsilon}\propto\frac{Re_{I}^{m}}{Re_{L}^{n}}   , with    m  ‚âà  1  ‚âà  n        m  1       n     m\approx 1\approx n   , where    R   e  I       R   subscript  e  I     Re_{I}   and    R   e  L       R   subscript  e  L     Re_{L}   are Reynolds numbers based, respectively, on initial/global conditions (such as free-stream velocity and the object's length scale ) and local conditions (such as the rms velocity and integral length scale). This new dissipation law characterises non-equilibrium turbulence apparently universally in various flows (not just multiscale turbulence) and results from non-equilibrium unsteady energy cascade . This imbalance implies that new mean flow scalings exist for free shear turbulent flows, as already observed in axisymmetric wakes 19  References  "  Category:Chaos theory  Category:Turbulence  Category:Fluid dynamics     ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  Nediƒá, J., B.
