   Bratteli diagram      Bratteli diagram  In mathematics, a '''Bratteli diagram''' is a combinatorial structure: a [[graph (mathematics)|graph]] composed of vertices labelled by positive intege rs ("level") and unoriented edges between vertices having levels differing by one. The notion was introduced by Ola Bratteli 1 in 1972 in the theory of operator algebras to describe directed sequences of finite-dimensional algebras: it played an important role in Elliott's classification of AF-algebras and the theory of subfactors . Subsequently Anatoly Vershik associated dynamical systems with infinite paths in such graphs. 2  Definition  A Bratteli diagram is given by the following objects:   A sequence of sets V n ('the vertices at level n ') labeled by positive integer set N . In some literature each element v of V n is accompanied by a positive integer b v > 0.  A sequence of sets E n ('the edges from level n to n + 1 ') labeled by N , endowed with maps s : E n → V n and r : E n → V n +1 , such that:  For each v in V n , the number of elements e in E n with s ( e ) = v is finite.  So is the number of e ∈ E n −1 with r ( e ) = v .  When the vertices have markings by positive integers b v , the number a v , v ' of the edges with s ( e ) = v and r ( e ) = v' for v ∈ V n and v' ∈ V n +1 satisfies b v  a v, v' ≤ b v' .    A customary way to pictorially represent Bratteli diagrams is to align the vertices according to their levels, and put the number b v beside the vertex v , or use that number in place of v , as in   1 = 2 − 3 − 4 ...  \ 1 ∠ 1 ∠ 1 ... .   An Ordered Bratteli diagram is a Bratteli diagram together with a partial order on E n such that for any v ∈ V n the set { e ∈ E n-1 : r ( e )= v } is totally ordered. Edges that do not share a common range vertex are incomparable. This partial order allows us to define the set of all maximal edges E max and the set of all minimal edges E min . A Bratteli diagram with a unique infinitely long path in E max and E min is called essentially simple . 3  Sequence of finite-dimensional algebras  Any semisimple algebra over the complex numbers  C of finite dimension can be expressed as a direct sum ⊕ k M n k ( C ) of matrix algebras , and the C -algebra homomorphisms between two such algebras up to inner automorphisms on both sides are completely determined by the multiplicity number between 'matrix algebra' components. Thus, an injective homomorphism of ⊕ k =1 i  M n k ( C ) into ⊕ l =1 j  M m l ( C ) may be represented by a collection of numbers a k , l satisfying ∑ n k  a k , l ≤ m l (the equality holds if and only if the homomorphism is unital). This can be illustrated as a bipartite graph having the vertices marked by numbers ( n k ) k on one hand and the ones marked by ( m l ) l on the other hand, and having a k , l edges between the vertex n k and the vertex m l .  Thus, when we have a sequence of finite-dimensional semisimple algebras A n and injective homomorphisms φ n : A n ' → A n +1 : between them, we obtain a Bratteli diagram by putting   V n = the set of simple components of A n    (each isomorphic to a matrix algebra), marked by the size of matrices.   ( E n , r , s ): the number of the edges between M n k ( C ) ⊂ A n and M m l ( C ) ⊂ A n +1 is equal to the multiplicity of M n k ( C ) into M m l ( C ) under φ n .   Sequence of split semisimple algebras  Any semisimple algebra (possibly of infinite dimension) is one whose modules are completely reducible, i.e. they decompose into the direct sum of simple modules . Let     A  0   ⊆   A  1   ⊆   A  2   ⊆  ⋯         subscript  A  0    subscript  A  1         subscript  A  2        normal-⋯     A_{0}\subseteq A_{1}\subseteq A_{2}\subseteq\cdots   be a chain of split semisimple algebras, and let     A  ^   i     subscript   normal-^  A   i    \hat{A}_{i}   be the indexing set for the irreducible representations of    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   . Denote by    A  i  λ     superscript   subscript  A  i   λ    A_{i}^{\lambda}   the irreducible module indexed by    λ  ∈    A  ^   i       λ   subscript   normal-^  A   i     \lambda\in\hat{A}_{i}   . Because of the inclusion     A  i   ⊆   A   i  +  1         subscript  A  i    subscript  A    i  1      A_{i}\subseteq A_{i+1}   , any    A   i  +  1      subscript  A    i  1     A_{i+1}   -module   M   M   M   restricts to a    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   -module. Let    g   λ  ,  μ      subscript  g   λ  μ     g_{\lambda,\mu}   denote the decomposition numbers      A   i  +  1   μ    ↓   A  i    A   i  +  1     =   ⊕   λ  ∈    A  ^   i      g   λ  ,  μ     A  i  λ   .     fragments   superscript   subscript  A    i  1    μ    subscript   superscript  normal-↓   subscript  A    i  1      subscript  A  i      subscript  direct-sum    λ   subscript   normal-^  A   i      subscript  g   λ  μ     superscript   subscript  A  i   λ   normal-.    A_{i+1}^{\mu}\downarrow^{A_{i+1}}_{A_{i}}=\bigoplus_{\lambda\in\hat{A}_{i}}g_{%
 \lambda,\mu}A_{i}^{\lambda}.    The Bratteli diagram for the chain     A  0   ⊆   A  1   ⊆   A  2   ⊆  ⋯         subscript  A  0    subscript  A  1         subscript  A  2        normal-⋯     A_{0}\subseteq A_{1}\subseteq A_{2}\subseteq\cdots   is obtained by placing one vertex for every element of     A  ^   i     subscript   normal-^  A   i    \hat{A}_{i}   on level   i   i   i   and connecting a vertex   λ   λ   \lambda   on level   i   i   i   to a vertex   μ   μ   \mu   on level    i  +  1      i  1    i+1   with    g   λ  ,  μ      subscript  g   λ  μ     g_{\lambda,\mu}   edges.  Examples  (Figure)  Bratteli diagram for Brauer and BMW algebras on i=0,1,2,3, and 4 strands.   (1) If     A  i   =   S  i        subscript  A  i    subscript  S  i     A_{i}=S_{i}   , the ith symmetric group , the corresponding Bratteli diagram is the same as Young's lattice .  (2) If    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   is the Brauer algebra or the Birman-Wenzl algebra on i strands, then the resulting Bratteli diagram has partitions of i-2k (for    k  =   0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,   ⌊   i  /  2   ⌋        k   0  1  2  normal-…      i  2       k=0,1,2,\ldots,\lfloor i/2\rfloor   ) with one edge between partitions on adjacent levels if one can be obtained from the other by adding or subtracting 1 from a single part.  (3) If    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   is the Temperley-Lieb algebra on i strands, the resulting Bratteli has integers i-2k (for    k  =   0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,   ⌊   i  /  2   ⌋        k   0  1  2  normal-…      i  2       k=0,1,2,\ldots,\lfloor i/2\rfloor   ) with one edge between integers on adjacent levels if one can be obtained from the other by adding or subtracting 1.
