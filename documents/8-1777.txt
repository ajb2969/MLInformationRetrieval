Lookahead carry unit

A lookahead carry unit (LCU) is a logical unit in digital circuit design used to decrease calculation time in adder units and used in conjunction with carry look-ahead adders (CLAs).

16-bit adder
By combining four 4-bit CLAs, a 16-bit adder can be created but additional logic is needed in the form of an LCU.
The LCU accepts the group propagate (
 
 
 
 ) and group generate (
 
 
 
 ) from each of the four CLAs. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have the following expressions for each CLA adder:1






The LCU then generates the carry input for each CLA.
Assume that 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  from the ith CLA then the output carry bits are












Substituting 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
  yields the expanded equations:












 
  corresponds to the carry input into the second CLA; 
 
 
 
  to the third CLA; 
 
 
 
  to the fourth CLA; and 
 
 
 
  to overflow carry bit.
In addition, the LCU can calculate its own propagate and generate:

64-bit adder
By combining 4 CLAs and an LCU together creates a 16-bit adder. Four of these units can be combined to form a 64-bit adder. An additional (second-level) LCU is needed that accepts the propagate (
 
 
 
 ) and generate (
 
 
 
 ) from each LCU and the four carry outputs generated by the second-level LCU are fed into the first-level LCUs.
