   Lookahead carry unit      Lookahead carry unit   A lookahead carry unit ( LCU ) is a logical unit in digital circuit design used to decrease calculation time in adder units and used in conjunction with carry look-ahead adders (CLAs).  4-bit adder  A single 4-bit CLA is shown below: none|framed|4-bit adder with Carry Look Ahead (CLA)  16-bit adder  By combining four 4-bit CLAs, a 16-bit adder can be created but additional logic is needed in the form of an LCU.  The LCU accepts the group propagate (    P  G     subscript  P  G    P_{G}   ) and group generate (    G  G     subscript  G  G    G_{G}   ) from each of the four CLAs.    P  G     subscript  P  G    P_{G}   and    G  G     subscript  G  G    G_{G}   have the following expressions for each CLA adder: 1       P  G   =    P  3   ⋅   P  2   ⋅   P  1   ⋅   P  0         subscript  P  G    normal-⋅   subscript  P  3    subscript  P  2    subscript  P  1    subscript  P  0      P_{G}=P_{3}\cdot P_{2}\cdot P_{1}\cdot P_{0}          G  G   =    G  3   +    P  3   ⋅   G  2    +    P  3   ⋅   P  2   ⋅   G  1    +    P  3   ⋅   P  2   ⋅   P  1   ⋅   G  0          subscript  G  G      subscript  G  3    normal-⋅   subscript  P  3    subscript  G  2     normal-⋅   subscript  P  3    subscript  P  2    subscript  G  1     normal-⋅   subscript  P  3    subscript  P  2    subscript  P  1    subscript  G  0       G_{G}=G_{3}+P_{3}\cdot G_{2}+P_{3}\cdot P_{2}\cdot G_{1}+P_{3}\cdot P_{2}\cdot

 16}     (Figure)  16-bit adder with LCU   64-bit adder  By combining 4 CLAs and an LCU together creates a 16-bit adder. Four of these units can be combined to form a 64-bit adder. An additional (second-level) LCU is needed that accepts the propagate (    P   L  C  U      subscript  P    L  C  U     P_{LCU}   ) and generate (    G   L  C  U      subscript  G    L  C  U     G_{LCU}   ) from each LCU and the four carry outputs generated by the second-level LCU are fed into the first-level LCUs.
