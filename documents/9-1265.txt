Kravchuk polynomials

Kravchuk polynomials or Krawtchouk polynomials (also written using several other transliterations of the Ukrainian name "Кравчу́к") are discrete orthogonal polynomials associated with the binomial distribution, introduced by . The first few polynomials are (for q=2):














The Kravchuk polynomials are a special case of the Meixner polynomials of the first kind.
