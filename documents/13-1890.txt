   Lobb numbers      Lobb numbers   In combinatorial mathematics , the Lobb number  L m , n counts the number of ways that n + m open parentheses and n − m close parentheses can be arranged to form the start of a valid sequence of balanced parentheses . 1  Lobb numbers form a natural generalization of the Catalan numbers , which count the number of complete strings of balanced parentheses of a given length. Thus, the n th Catalan number equals the Lobb number L 0, n . 2 They are named after Andrew Lobb, who used them to give a simple inductive proof of the formula for the n th Catalan number. 3  The Lobb numbers are parameterized by two non-negative integers  m and n with n ≥ m ≥ 0. The ( m , n ) th Lobb number L m , n is given in terms of binomial coefficients by the formula        L   m  ,  n    =      2  m   +  1    m  +  n  +  1     (      2  n        m  +  n      )       for  n   ≥  m  ≥  0.      formulae-sequence     subscript  L   m  n            2  m   1     m  n  1     binomial    2  n     m  n            for  n   m       0.      L_{m,n}=\frac{2m+1}{m+n+1}{\left({{2n}\atop{m+n}}\right)}\qquad\text{ for }n%
 \geq m\geq 0.     As well as counting sequences of parentheses, the Lobb numbers also count the number of ways in which n + m copies of the value +1 and n − m copies of the value −1 may be arranged into a sequence such that all of the partial sums of the sequence are non-negative.
