   Mannose-6-phosphate 6-reductase      Mannose-6-phosphate 6-reductase   In enzymology , a mannose-6-phosphate 6-reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-mannitol 1-phosphate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-mannose 6-phosphate + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-mannitol 1-phosphate and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are D-mannose 6-phosphate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-mannitol-1-phosphate:NADP + 6-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include NADPH-dependent mannose 6-phosphate reductase , mannose-6-phosphate reductase , 6-phosphomannose reductase , NADP + -dependent mannose-6-P:mannitol-1-P oxidoreductase , NADPH-dependent M6P reductase , and NADPH-mannose-6-P reductase .
