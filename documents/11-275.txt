   Ultrahyperbolic equation      Ultrahyperbolic equation   In the mathematical field of partial differential equations , the ultrahyperbolic equation is a partial differential equation for an unknown scalar function u of 2 n variables x 1 , ..., x n , y 1 , ..., y n of the form           ∂  2   u    ∂   x  1  2     +  ⋯  +     ∂  2   u    ∂   x  n  2      -     ∂  2   u    ∂   y  1  2     -  ⋯  -     ∂  2   u    ∂   y  n  2      =   0.

Any such equation can be put in the form 1. above by means of a change of variables. 1  The ultrahyperbolic equation has been studied from a number of viewpoints. On the one hand, it resembles the classical wave equation . This has led to a number of developments concerning its characteristics , one of which is due to Fritz John : the John equation .  Walter Craig and Steven Weinstein recently (2008) proved that under a nonlocal constraint, the initial value problem is well-posed for initial data given on a codimension-one hypersurface. 2  The equation has also been studied from the point of view of symmetric spaces , and elliptic differential operators . 3 In particular, the ultrahyperbolic equation satisfies an analog of the mean value theorem for harmonic functions  Notes  References         "  Category:Differential operators     See Courant and Hilbert. ↩  ↩  See, for instance, Helgasson. ↩
