Local asymptotic normality

In statistics, local asymptotic normality is a property of a sequence of statistical models, which allows this sequence to be asymptotically approximated by a normal location model, after a rescaling of the parameter. An important example when the local asymptotic normality holds is in the case of iid sampling from a regular parametric model.
The notion of local asymptotic normality was introduced by .
Definition
A sequence of parametric statistical models } is said to be locally asymptotically normal (LAN) at θ if there exist matrices rn and Iθ and a random vector  such that, for every converging sequence ,1


 
  where the derivative here is a Radon–Nikodym derivative, which is a formalised version of the likelihood ratio, and where o is a type of big O in probability notation. In other words, the local likelihood ratio must converge in distribution to a normal random variable whose mean is equal to minus one half the variance:



The sequences of distributions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are contiguous.2
Example
The most straightforward example of a LAN model is an iid model whose likelihood is twice continuously differentiable. Suppose } is an iid sample, where each Xi has density function . The likelihood function of the model is equal to


 
  If f is twice continuously differentiable in θ, then



Plugging in , gives


 
  By the central limit theorem, the first term (in parentheses) converges in distribution to a normal random variable , whereas by the law of large numbers the expression in second parentheses converges in probability to Iθ, which is the Fisher information matrix:


 
  Thus, the definition of the local asymptotic normality is satisfied, and we have confirmed that the parametric model with iid observations and twice continuously differentiable likelihood has the LAN property.
