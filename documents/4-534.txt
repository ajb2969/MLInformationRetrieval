   130 Elektra      130 Elektra   130 Elektra is a very large outer main-belt  asteroid . It was discovered by C. H. F. Peters on February 17, 1873, and named after Electra , an avenger in Greek mythology .  Its spectrum is of the G type , hence it probably has a Ceres -like composition. Spectral signatures of organic compounds have been seen on Elektra's surface. 1  In the late 1990s, a network of astronomers worldwide gathered lightcurve data that was ultimately used to derive the spin states and shape models of 10 new asteroids, including (130) Elektra. The light curve of (130) Elektra forms a double sinusoid while the shape model is elongated and the derived rotation axis is perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic . 2 3  Optical observations have found two satellites of this asteroid. Once the orbits are known, Elektra's mass can be reliably found. The value of 6.6     ×    10  1   8       absent     superscript  10  1   8     \times 10^{1}8   kg indicates a density of 1.3 ± 0.3 g/cm 3 . Optical observations have also determined that Elektra's shape is quite irregular, as well as giving indications of albedo differences of 5-15% on its surface. 4  Satellites S/2003 (130) 1 and S/2014 (130) 1  In 2003, a small moon of (130) Elektra was detected using the Keck II telescope . The diameter of the satellite is 4 km and it orbits at a distance of about 1170 km. The satellite has been given the provisional designation S/2003 (130) 1 . Due to only a few observations to date, its orbit is still relatively loosely constrained. 5 In December 2014 a slightly smaller moon, orbiting Elektra about three times closer than S/2003 (130) 1, was discovered using the SPHERE instrument on the VLT's Melipal (UT3) telescope. This second satellite has been provisionally named S/2014 (130) 1 .  References  External links   130 Elektra and S/2003 (130) 1 , orbit data website maintained by F. Marchis.
