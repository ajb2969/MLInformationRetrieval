   ITU model for indoor attenuation      ITU model for indoor attenuation   The ITU indoor propagation model , also known as ITU model for indoor attenuation , is a radio propagation model that estimates the path loss inside a room or a closed area inside a building delimited by walls of any form. Suitable for appliances designed for indoor use, this model approximates the total path loss an indoor link may experience.  Applicable to/under conditions  This model is applicable to only the indoor environments. Typically, such appliances use the lower microwave bands around 2.4 GHz. However, the model applies to a much wider range.  Coverage  Frequency : 900 MHz to 5.2 GHz  Floors: 1 to 3  Mathematical formulations  The model  The ITU indoor path loss model is formally expressed as:       L   =      20    log   f     +    N    log   d     +    P  f    (  n  )     -  28       L        20    f      N    d       subscript  P  f   n    28     L\;=\;20\;\log f\;+\;N\;\log d\;+\;P_{f}(n)\;-\;28     where,   L = the total path loss . Unit: decibel (dB).  f = Frequency of transmission. Unit: megahertz (MHz).  d = Distance. Unit: metre (m).  N = The distance power loss coefficient.  n = Number of floors between the transmitter and receiver.  P f (n) = the floor loss penetration factor.   Calculation of distance power loss coefficient  The distance power loss coefficient, N is the quantity that expresses the loss of signal power with distance. This coefficient is an empirical one.
