   Butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase      Butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   butyryl-CoA + acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-butenoyl-CoA + reduced acceptor   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are butyryl-CoA and an acceptor , whereas its two products are 2-butenoyl-CoA and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is butanoyl-CoA:acceptor 2,3-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include butyryl dehydrogenase , unsaturated acyl-CoA reductase , ethylene reductase , enoyl-coenzyme A reductase , unsaturated acyl coenzyme A reductase , butyryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase , short-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase , short-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase , 3-hydroxyacyl CoA reductase , and butanoyl-CoA:(acceptor) 2,3-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : fatty acid metabolism , valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation , and butanoate metabolism . It employs one cofactor , FAD .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .  References   Boyer, P.D., Lardy, H. and Myrback, K.
