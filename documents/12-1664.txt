Strict-feedback form

In control theory, dynamical systems are in strict-feedback form when they can be expressed as



where



 
  with 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  are scalars,


 
  is a scalar input to the system,


vanish at the origin (i.e., 
 
 
 
 ),


 
  are nonzero over the domain of interest (i.e., 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 ).

Here, strict feedback refers to the fact that the nonlinear functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in the 
 
 
 
  equation only depend on states 
 
 
 
  that are fed back to that subsystem.1 That is, the system has a kind of lower triangular form.
Stabilization




Systems in strict-feedback form can be stabilized by recursive application of backstepping.2 That is,

It is given that the system
 






is already stabilized to the origin by some control 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 . That is, choice of 
 
 
 
  to stabilize this system must occur using some other method. It is also assumed that a Lyapunov function

 
  for this stable subsystem is known.
 

A control 
 
 
 
  is designed so that the system
 






is stabilized so that 
 
 
 
  follows the desired 
 
 
 
  control. The control design is based on the augmented Lyapunov function candidate
 
 



The control 
 
 
 
  can be picked to bound 
 
 
 
  away from zero.

This process continues until the actual 
 
 
 
  is known, and
 
The real control 
 
 
 
  stabilizes 
 
 
 
  to fictitious control

This process is known as backstepping because it starts with the requirements on some internal subsystem for stability and progressively steps back out of the system, maintaining stability at each step. Because



 
  vanish at the origin for 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  are nonzero for 
 
 
 
 ,
the given control 
 
 
 
  has 
 
 
 
 ,

then the resulting system has an equilibrium at the origin (i.e., where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , ... , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 ) that is globally asymptotically stable.
