   Cholestanetetraol 26-dehydrogenase      Cholestanetetraol 26-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a cholestanetetraol 26-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (25R)-5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,26-tetraol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (25R)-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-al + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (25R)-5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,26-tetraol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are (25R)-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-al , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (25R)-5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,26-tetraol:NAD + 26-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include cholestanetetrol 26-dehydrogenase , 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,26-tetrol dehydrogenase , TEHC-NAD oxidoreductase , 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,26-tetraol:NAD + , and 26-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in bile acid biosynthesis .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
