   Galactonolactone dehydrogenase      Galactonolactone dehydrogenase   L-galactonolactone dehydrogenase (, galactonolactone dehydrogenase , L-galactono-gamma-lactone dehydrogenase , L-galactono-gamma-lactone:ferricytochrome-c oxidoreductase , GLDHase , GLDase ) is an enzyme with system name L-galactono-1,4-lactone:ferricytochrome-c oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 4 5 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) L-galactono-1,4-lactone + 2 ferricytochrome c   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-ascorbate + 2 ferrocytochrome c + 2 H +   (2) L-ascorbate + 2 ferricytochrome c   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-dehydroascorbate + 2 ferrocytochrome c + 2 H + (spontaneous)   This enzyme catalyses the final step in the biosynthesis of L-ascorbic acid in higher plants and in nearly all higher animals , except for primates and some birds .
