   Warburg coefficient      Warburg coefficient   The Warburg coefficient (or Warburg constant),    A  W     subscript  A  W    A_{W}   , is the diffusion coefficient of ions in solution, associated to the Warburg element ,    Z  W     subscript  Z  W    Z_{W}   . The Warburg coefficient,    A  W     subscript  A  W    A_{W}   , also written as,   σ   σ   {\sigma}   , has the units of     Ω  /    s  e  c  o  n  d  s     =   Ω   (   s   -   1  /  2     )          normal-Ω      s  e  c  o  n  d  s       normal-Ω   superscript  s      1  2        {\Omega}/\sqrt{seconds}={\Omega}(s^{-1/2})     The value of    A  W     subscript  A  W    A_{W}   can be obtained by the gradient of the Warburg plot, a linear plot of the real impedance (   R   R   R   ) against the reciprocal of the square root of the frequency (    1  /   ω       1    ω     {1}/\sqrt{\omega}   ). This relation should always yield a straight line, as it is unique for a Warburg.  Alternatively, the value of    A  W     subscript  A  W    A_{W}   can be found by:       A  W   =     R  T    A   n  2    F  2    2      (    1    D  O   1  /  2     C  O  b     +   1    D  R   1  /  2     C  R  b      )    =    R  T    A   n  2    F  2   Θ  C    2  D             subscript  A  W         R  T     A   superscript  n  2    superscript  F  2     2         1     superscript   subscript  D  O     1  2     superscript   subscript  C  O   b       1     superscript   subscript  D  R     1  2     superscript   subscript  C  R   b                R  T     A   superscript  n  2    superscript  F  2   normal-Θ  C      2  D         A_{W}={\frac{RT}{An^{2}F^{2}\sqrt{2}}}{\left(\frac{1}{D_{O}^{1/2}C_{O}^{b}}+{%
 \frac{1}{D_{R}^{1/2}C_{R}^{b}}}\right)}=\frac{RT}{An^{2}F^{2}\Theta C\sqrt{2D}}     where   R   R   R   is the ideal gas constant ,   T   T   T   is the thermodynamic temperature ,   F   F   F   is the Faraday constant ,   n   n   n   is the valency ,   D   D   D   is the diffusion coefficient of the species where subscripts   O   O   O   and   R   R   R   stand for the oxidized and reduced species respectively,    C  b     superscript  C  b    C^{b}   is the concentration of the   O   O   O   and   R   R   R   species in the bulk, C is the concentration of the electrolyte,   A   A   A   denotes the surface area and   Θ   normal-Θ   \Theta   denotes the fraction of the   R   R   R   and   O   O   O   species present.  The equation for    A  W     subscript  A  W    A_{W}   applies to both reversible and quasi-reversible reactions for which both halves of the couple are soluble.  References   A.
