Warburg coefficient

The Warburg coefficient (or Warburg constant), 
 
 
 
 , is the diffusion coefficient of ions in solution, associated to the Warburg element, 
 
 
 
 . The Warburg coefficient, 
 
 
 
 , also written as, 
 
 
 
 
 , has the units of 
 
 

The value of 
 
 
 
  can be obtained by the gradient of the Warburg plot, a linear plot of the real impedance (
 
 
 
 ) against the reciprocal of the square root of the frequency (
 
 
 
 ). This relation should always yield a straight line, as it is unique for a Warburg.
Alternatively, the value of 
 
 
 
 
  can be found by:



where 
 
 
 
  is the ideal gas constant, 
 
 
 
  is the thermodynamic temperature, 
 
 
 
  is the Faraday constant, 
 
 
 
 
  is the valency, 
 
 
 
  is the diffusion coefficient of the species where subscripts 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  stand for the oxidized and reduced species respectively, 
 
 
 
  is the concentration of the 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  species in the bulk, C is the concentration of the electrolyte, 
 
 
 
  denotes the surface area and 
 
 
 
  denotes the fraction of the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  species present.
The equation for 
 
 
 
  applies to both reversible and quasi-reversible reactions for which both halves of the couple are soluble.
