   Polynomial Wigner–Ville distribution      Polynomial Wigner–Ville distribution   In signal processing, the polynomial Wigner–Ville distribution is a quasiprobability distribution that generalizes the Wigner distribution function . It was proposed by Boualem Boashash and Peter O'Shea in 1994.  Introduction  Many signals in nature and in engineering applications can be modeled as     z   (  t  )    =   e   j  2  π  ϕ   (  t  )           z  t    superscript  e    j  2  π  ϕ  t      z(t)=e^{j2\pi\phi(t)}   , where    ϕ   (  t  )       ϕ  t    \phi(t)   is a polynomial phase and    j  =    -  1        j      1      j=\sqrt{-1}   .  For example, it is important to detect signals of an arbitrary high-order polynomial phase. However, the conventional Wigner–Ville distribution have the limitation being based on the second-order statistics. Hence, the polynomial Wigner–Ville distribution was proposed as a generalized form of the conventional Wigner–Ville distribution, which is able to deal signals with nonlinear phase.  Definition  The polynomial Wigner–Ville distribution     W  z  g    (  t  ,  f  )        subscript   superscript  W  g   z    t  f     W^{g}_{z}(t,f)   is defined as        W  z  g    (  t  ,  f  )    =    ℱ   τ  →  f     [    K  z  g    (  t  ,  τ  )    ]           subscript   superscript  W  g   z    t  f       subscript  ℱ   normal-→  τ  f     delimited-[]     subscript   superscript  K  g   z    t  τ        W^{g}_{z}(t,f)=\mathcal{F}_{\tau\to f}\left[K^{g}_{z}(t,\tau)\right]     where    ℱ   τ  →  f      subscript  ℱ   normal-→  τ  f     \mathcal{F}_{\tau\to f}   denotes the Fourier transform with respect to   τ   τ   \tau   , and     K  z  g    (  t  ,  τ  )        subscript   superscript  K  g   z    t  τ     K^{g}_{z}(t,\tau)   is the polynomial kernel given by        K  z  g    (  t  ,  τ  )    =    ∏   k  =   -   q  2      q  2      [   z   (   t  +    c  k   τ    )    ]    b  k            subscript   superscript  K  g   z    t  τ      superscript   subscript  product    k      q  2        q  2     superscript   delimited-[]    z    t     subscript  c  k   τ       subscript  b  k       K^{g}_{z}(t,\tau)=\prod_{k=-\frac{q}{2}}^{\frac{q}{2}}\left[z\left(t+c_{k}\tau%
 \right)\right]^{b_{k}}     where    z   (  t  )       z  t    z(t)   is the input signal and   p   p   p   is an even number. The above expression for the kernel may be rewritten in symmetric form as        K  z  g    (  t  ,  τ  )    =    ∏   k  =  0    q  2       [   z   (   t  +    c  k   τ    )    ]    b  k      [    z  *    (   t  +    c   -  k    τ    )    ]    -   b   -  k               subscript   superscript  K  g   z    t  τ      superscript   subscript  product    k  0      q  2       superscript   delimited-[]    z    t     subscript  c  k   τ       subscript  b  k     superscript   delimited-[]     superscript  z      t     subscript  c    k    τ         subscript  b    k          K^{g}_{z}(t,\tau)=\prod_{k=0}^{\frac{q}{2}}\left[z\left(t+c_{k}\tau\right)%
 \right]^{b_{k}}\left[z^{*}\left(t+c_{-k}\tau\right)\right]^{-b_{-k}}     The discrete-time version of the polynomial Wigner–Ville distribution is given by the discrete Fourier transform of        K  z  g    (  n  ,  m  )    =    ∏   k  =  0    q  2       [   z   (   n  +    c  k   m    )    ]    b  k      [    z  *    (   n  +    c   -  k    m    )    ]    -   b   -  k               subscript   superscript  K  g   z    n  m      superscript   subscript  product    k  0      q  2       superscript   delimited-[]    z    n     subscript  c  k   m       subscript  b  k     superscript   delimited-[]     superscript  z      n     subscript  c    k    m         subscript  b    k          K^{g}_{z}(n,m)=\prod_{k=0}^{\frac{q}{2}}\left[z\left(n+c_{k}m\right)\right]^{b%
 _{k}}\left[z^{*}\left(n+c_{-k}m\right)\right]^{-b_{-k}}     where      n  =   t   f  s     ,   m  =   τ   f  s      ,     formulae-sequence    n    t   subscript  f  s       m    τ   subscript  f  s       n=t{f}_{s},m={\tau}{f}_{s},   and    f  s     subscript  f  s    f_{s}   is the sampling frequency. The conventional Wigner–Ville distribution is a special case of the polynomial Wigner–Ville distribution with     q  =  2   ,     b   -  1    =   -  1    ,     b  1   =  1   ,     b  0   =  0   ,     c   -  1    =   -   1  2     ,     c  0   =  0   ,    c  1   =   1  2            formulae-sequence    q  2    formulae-sequence     subscript  b    1      1     formulae-sequence     subscript  b  1   1    formulae-sequence     subscript  b  0   0    formulae-sequence     subscript  c    1        1  2      formulae-sequence     subscript  c  0   0      subscript  c  1     1  2           q=2,b_{-1}=-1,b_{1}=1,b_{0}=0,c_{-1}=-\frac{1}{2},c_{0}=0,c_{1}=\frac{1}{2}     Example  One of the simplest generalizations of the usual Wigner–Ville distribution kernel can be achieved by taking    q  =  4      q  4    q=4   . The set of coefficients    b  k     subscript  b  k    b_{k}   and    c  k     subscript  c  k    c_{k}   must be found to completely specify the new kernel. For example, we set        b  1   =   -   b   -  1     =  2   ,    b  2   =   b   -  2    =  1   ,    b  0   =  0      formulae-sequence       subscript  b  1      subscript  b    1          2         subscript  b  2    subscript  b    2         1       subscript  b  0   0     b_{1}=-b_{-1}=2,b_{2}=b_{-2}=1,b_{0}=0           c  1   =   -   c   -  1     =  0.675   ,    c  2   =   -   c   -  2     =   -  0.85       formulae-sequence       subscript  c  1      subscript  c    1          0.675         subscript  c  2      subscript  c    2            0.85       c_{1}=-c_{-1}=0.675,c_{2}=-c_{-2}=-0.85     The resulting discrete-time kernel is then given by        K  z  g    (  n  ,  m  )    =     [   z   (   n  +   0.675  m    )    z  *    (   n  -   0.675  m    )    ]   2    z  *    (   n  +   0.85  m    )   z   (   n  -   0.85  m    )           subscript   superscript  K  g   z    n  m       superscript   delimited-[]    z    n    0.675  m     superscript  z      n    0.675  m      2    superscript  z      n    0.85  m    z    n    0.85  m       K^{g}_{z}(n,m)=\left[z\left(n+0.675m\right)z^{*}\left(n-0.675m\right)\right]^{%
 2}z^{*}\left(n+0.85m\right)z\left(n-0.85m\right)     Applications  Nonlinear FM signals are common both in nature and in engineering applications. For example, the sonar system of some bats use hyperbolic FM and quadratic FM signals for echo location. In radar, certain pulse-compression schemes employ linear FM and quadratic signals. The Wigner–Ville distribution has optimal concentration in the time-frequency plane for linear frequency modulated signals. However, for nonlinear frequency modulated signals, optimal concentration is not obtained, and smeared spectral representations result. The polynomial Wigner–Ville distribution can be designed to cope with such problem.  References  1. B. Boashash and P.
