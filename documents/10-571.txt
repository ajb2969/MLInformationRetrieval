   L-rhamnose 1-dehydrogenase      L-rhamnose 1-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a L-rhamnose 1-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-rhamnofuranose + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-rhamno-1,4-lactone + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-rhamnofuranose and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are L-rhamno-1,4-lactone , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-rhamnofuranose:NAD + 1-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism .
