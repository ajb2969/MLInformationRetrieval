   Integral closure of an ideal      Integral closure of an ideal   In algebra, the integral closure of an ideal I of a commutative ring R , denoted by    I  ¯     normal-¯  I    \overline{I}   , is the set of all elements r in R that are integral over I : there exist     a  i   ∈   I  i        subscript  a  i    superscript  I  i     a_{i}\in I^{i}   such that        r  n   +    a  1    r   n  -  1     +  ⋯  +    a   n  -  1    r   +   a  n    =  0.         superscript  r  n      subscript  a  1    superscript  r    n  1     normal-⋯     subscript  a    n  1    r    subscript  a  n    0.    r^{n}+a_{1}r^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}r+a_{n}=0.   It is similar to the integral closure of a subring. For example, if R is a domain, an element r in R belongs to    I  ¯     normal-¯  I    \overline{I}   if and only if there is a finitely generated R -module M , annihilated only by zero, such that     r  M   ⊂   I  M         r  M     I  M     rM\subset IM   . It follows that    I  ¯     normal-¯  I    \overline{I}   is an ideal of R (in fact, the integral closure of an ideal is always an ideal; see below.) I is said to be integrally closed if    I  =   I  ¯       I   normal-¯  I     I=\overline{I}   .  The integral closure of an ideal appears in a theorem of Rees that characterizes an analytically unramified ring .  Examples   In    ℂ   [  x  ,  y  ]       ℂ   x  y     \mathbb{C}[x,y]   ,     x  i    y   d  -  i         superscript  x  i    superscript  y    d  i      x^{i}y^{d-i}   is integral over    (   x  d   ,   y  d   )      superscript  x  d    superscript  y  d     (x^{d},y^{d})   .  Radical ideals (e.g., prime ideals) are integrally closed. The intersection of integrally closed ideals is integrally closed.  Let    R  =   k   [   X  1   ,  …  ,   X  n   ]        R    k    subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  n       R=k[X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}]   be a polynomial ring over a field k . An ideal I in R is called monomial if it is generated by monomials; i.e.,     X  1   a  1    ⋯   X  n   a  n         superscript   subscript  X  1    subscript  a  1    normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  X  n    subscript  a  n      X_{1}^{a_{1}}\cdots X_{n}^{a_{n}}   . The integral closure of a monomial ideal is monomial.   Structure results  Let R be a ring. The Rees algebra      R   [   I  t   ]    =    ⊕   n  ≥  0      I  n    t  n           R   delimited-[]    I  t       subscript  direct-sum    n  0       superscript  I  n    superscript  t  n       R[It]=\oplus_{n\geq 0}I^{n}t^{n}   can be used to compute the integral closure of an ideal. The structure result is the following: the integral closure of    R   [   I  t   ]       R   delimited-[]    I  t      R[It]   in    R   [  t  ]       R   delimited-[]  t     R[t]   , which is graded, is     ⊕   n  ≥  0       I  n   ¯    t  n        subscript  direct-sum    n  0       normal-¯   superscript  I  n     superscript  t  n      \oplus_{n\geq 0}\overline{I^{n}}t^{n}   . In particular,    I  ¯     normal-¯  I    \overline{I}   is an ideal and     I  ¯   =    I  ¯   ¯        normal-¯  I    normal-¯   normal-¯  I      \overline{I}=\overline{\overline{I}}   ; i.e., the integral closure of an ideal is integrally closed. It also follows that the integral closure of a homogeneous ideal is homogeneous.  The following type of results is called the Briancon–Skoda theorem : let R be a regular ring and   I   I   I   an ideal generated by   l   l   l   elements. Then      I   n  +  l    ¯   ⊂   I   n  +  1         normal-¯   superscript  I    n  l      superscript  I    n  1      \overline{I^{n+l}}\subset I^{n+1}   for any    n  ≥  0      n  0    n\geq 0   .  A theorem of Rees states: let ( R , m ) be a noetherian local ring. Assume it is formally equidimensional (i.e., the completion is equidimensional.). Then two m -primary ideals    I  ⊂  J      I  J    I\subset J   have the same integral closure if and only if they have the same multiplicity . 1  Notes  References   Eisenbud, David , Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry , Graduate Texts in Mathematics, 150, Springer-Verlag, 1995, ISBN 0-387-94268-8.
