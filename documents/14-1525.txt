Canberra distance

The Canberra distance is a numerical measure of the distance between pairs of points in a vector space, introduced in 19661 and refined in 19672 by G. N. Lance and W. T. Williams. It is a weighted version of L₁ (Manhattan) distance.3 The Canberra distance has been used as a metric for comparing ranked lists4 and for intrusion detection in computer security.5
Definition
