   Canberra distance      Canberra distance   The Canberra distance is a numerical measure of the distance between pairs of points in a vector space , introduced in 1966 1 and refined in 1967 2 by G. N. Lance and W. T. Williams . It is a weighted version of L ₁ (Manhattan) distance . 3 The Canberra distance has been used as a metric for comparing ranked lists 4 and for intrusion detection in computer security . 5  Definition  The Canberra distance d between vectors p and q in an n -dimensional real  vector space is given as follows:        d   (  𝐩  ,  𝐪  )    =    ∑   i  =  1   n     |    p  i   -   q  i    |     |   p  i   |   +   |   q  i   |       ,        d   𝐩  𝐪      superscript   subscript     i  1    n          subscript  p  i    subscript  q  i          subscript  p  i       subscript  q  i         d(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{|p_{i}-q_{i}|}{|p_{i}|+|q_{i}|},     where      𝐩  =    (   p  1   ,   p  2   ,  …  ,   p  n   )   and  𝐪   =   (   q  1   ,   q  2   ,  …  ,   q  n   )         𝐩      subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2   normal-…   subscript  p  n    and  𝐪          subscript  q  1    subscript  q  2   normal-…   subscript  q  n       \mathbf{p}=(p_{1},p_{2},\dots,p_{n})\text{ and }\mathbf{q}=(q_{1},q_{2},\dots,%
