Papyrus 91

Papyrus 91 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designed by 
 
 
91, is an early copy of the New Testament in Greek. It is a papyrus manuscript of the Acts of Apostles. The surviving texts of Acts are verses 2:30-37; 2:46-3:2. The manuscript paleographically has been assigned to the middle of the 3rd century.1
Text
The Greek text of this manuscript is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type, Comfort ascribed it as proto-Alexandrian, though the extant portion is too fragmentary for certainty.2 It has not been placed yet in Aland's Categories of New Testament manuscripts.
Location
The larger portion of 
 
 
91 is housed at the Instituto di Papyrologia (P. Mil. Vofl. Inv. 1224) at the Universita Degli Studi di Milano. The smaller portion is housed at the Ancient History Documentary Research Centre3 at Macquarie University (Inv. 360) in Sydney.45
