Sphingosine N-acyltransferase




Sphingosine N-acyltransferase

In enzymology, a sphingosine N-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acyl-CoA + sphingosine 
 
 
 
  CoA + N-acylsphingosine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and sphingosine, whereas its two products are CoA and N-acylsphingosine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:sphingosine N-acyltransferase. Other names in common use include ceramide synthetase, and sphingosine acyltransferase. This enzyme participates in sphingolipid metabolism.
