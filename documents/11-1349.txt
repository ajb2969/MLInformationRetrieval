Poly(glycerol-phosphate) alpha-glucosyltransferase




Poly(glycerol-phosphate) alpha-glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, a poly(glycerol-phosphate) alpha-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + poly(glycerol phosphate) 
 
 
 
  UDP + O-(alpha-D-glucosyl)poly(glycerol phosphate)
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and poly(glycerol phosphate), whereas its two products are UDP and O-(alpha-D-glucosyl)poly(glycerol phosphate).
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:poly(glycerol-phosphate) alpha-D-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include UDP glucose-poly(glycerol-phosphate) alpha-glucosyltransferase, uridine diphosphoglucose-poly(glycerol-phosphate), and alpha-glucosyltransferase.
