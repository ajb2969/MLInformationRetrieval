   Guanosine-triphosphate guanylyltransferase      Guanosine-triphosphate guanylyltransferase   In enzymology , a guanosine-triphosphate guanylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 GTP   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + P 1 ,P 4 -bis(5'-guanosyl) tetraphosphate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , GTP , and two products , diphosphate and P1,P4-bis(5'-guanosyl) tetraphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is GTP:GTP guanylyltransferase . Other names in common use include diguanosine tetraphosphate synthetase , GTP-GTP guanylyltransferase , Gp4G synthetase , and guanosine triphosphate-guanose triphosphate guanylyltransferase .
