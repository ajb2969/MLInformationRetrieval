   Lefschetz zeta function      Lefschetz zeta function   In mathematics , the Lefschetz  zeta-function is a tool used in topological periodic and fixed point theory, and dynamical systems . Given a mapping f , the zeta-function is defined as the formal series         Œ∂  f    (  z  )    =   exp   (    ‚àë   n  =  1   ‚àû    L   (   f  n   )     z  n   n     )     ,         subscript  Œ∂  f   z       superscript   subscript     n  1        L   superscript  f  n      superscript  z  n   n        \zeta_{f}(z)=\exp\left(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}L(f^{n})\frac{z^{n}}{n}\right),     where L ( f n ) is the Lefschetz number of the n th iterate of f . This zeta-function is of note in topological periodic point theory because it is a single invariant containing information about all iterates of f .  Examples  The identity map on X has Lefschetz zeta function       1    (   1  -  t   )    œá   (  X  )      ,      1   superscript    1  t     œá  X      \frac{1}{(1-t)^{\chi(X)}},     where    œá   (  X  )       œá  X    \chi(X)   is the Euler characteristic of X , i.e., the Lefschetz number of the identity map.  For a less trivial example, let X = S 1 (the unit circle ), and let f be reflection in the x -axis: or f (Œ∏) = ‚àíŒ∏. Then f has Lefschetz number 2, and f 2 is the identity map, which has Lefschetz number 0. All odd iterates have Lefschetz number 2, all even iterates have Lefschetz number 0. Therefore the zeta function of f is       Œ∂  f    (  t  )        subscript  Œ∂  f   t    \displaystyle\zeta_{f}(t)     Formula  If f is a continuous map on a compact manifold X of dimension n (or more generally any compact polyhedron), the zeta function is given by the formula       Œ∂  f    (  t  )   =   ‚àè   i  =  0   n   det    (  1  -  t   f  ‚àó   |   H  i    (  X  ,  ùêê  )   )     (   -  1   )    i  +  1     .     fragments   subscript  Œ∂  f    fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)     superscript   subscript  product    i  0    n     superscript   fragments  normal-(  1   t   subscript  f  normal-‚àó   normal-|   subscript  H  i    fragments  normal-(  X  normal-,  Q  normal-)   normal-)    superscript    1     i  1     normal-.    \zeta_{f}(t)=\prod_{i=0}^{n}\det(1-tf_{\ast}|H_{i}(X,\mathbf{Q}))^{(-1)^{i+1}}.     Thus it is a rational function. The polynomials occurring in the numerator and denominator are essentially the characteristic polynomials of the map induced by f on the various homology spaces.  Connections  This generating function is essentially an algebraic form of the Artin‚ÄìMazur zeta-function , which gives geometric information about the fixed and periodic points of f .
