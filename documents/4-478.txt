Compact-open topology

In mathematics, the compact-open topology is a topology defined on the set of continuous maps between two topological spaces. The compact-open topology is one of the commonly used topologies on function spaces, and is applied in homotopy theory and functional analysis. It was introduced by Ralph Fox in 1945 1.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be two topological spaces, and let 
 
 
 
  denote the set of all continuous maps between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Given a compact subset

 
  of 
 
 
 
  and an open subset

 
  of 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  denote the set of all functions 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  Then the collection of all such 
 
 
 
  is a subbase for the compact-open topology on 
 
 
 
 . (This collection does not always form a base for a topology on 
 
 
 
 .)
When working in the category of compactly generated spaces, it is common to modify this definition by restricting to the subbase formed from those 
 
 
 
  which are the image of a compact Hausdorff space. Of course, if 
 
 
 
  is compactly generated and Hausdorff, this definition coincides with the previous one. However, the modified definition is crucial if one wants the convenient category of compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces to be Cartesian closed, among other useful properties.123 The confusion between this definition and the one above is caused by differing usage of the word compact.
Properties

If 
 
 
 
  is a one-point space then one can identify 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , and under this identification the compact-open topology agrees with the topology on 
 
 
 
 .


If 
 
 
 
  is , , Hausdorff, regular, or Tychonoff, then the compact-open topology has the corresponding separation axiom.


If 
 
 
 
  is Hausdorff and 
 
 
 
  is a subbase for 
 
 
 
 , then the collection is a subbase for the compact-open topology on 
 
 
 
 .


If 
 
 
 
  is a metric space (or more generally, a uniform space), then the compact-open topology is equal to the topology of compact convergence. In other words, if 
 
 
 
  is a metric space, then a sequence converges to 
 
 
 
  in the compact-open topology if and only if for every compact subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , converges uniformly to 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 . In particular, if 
 
 
 
  is compact and 
 
 
 
  is a uniform space, then the compact-open topology is equal to the topology of uniform convergence.


If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are topological spaces, with 
 
 
locally compact Hausdorff (or even just locally compact preregular), then the composition map

 
  given by 
 
 
 
  is continuous (here all the function spaces are given the compact-open topology and 
 
 
 
  is given the product topology).


If 
 
 
 
  is a locally compact Hausdorff (or preregular) space, then the evaluation map 
 
 
 
 , defined by 
 
 
 
 , is continuous. This can be seen as a special case of the above where 
 
 
 
  is a one-point space.


If 
 
 
 
  is compact, and 
 
 
 
  is a metric space with metric 
 
 
 
 , then the compact-open topology on 
 
 
 
  is metrisable, and a metric for it is given by  for 
 
 
 
 .

Fréchet differentiable functions
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be two Banach spaces defined over the same field, and let  denote the set of all 
 
 
 
 -continuously Fréchet-differentiable functions from the open subset 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . The compact-open topology is the initial topology induced by the seminorms
