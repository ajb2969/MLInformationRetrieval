   Stevedore knot (mathematics)      Stevedore knot (mathematics)   (Figure)  The common stevedore knot . If the ends were joined together, the result would be equivalent to the mathematical knot.   In knot theory , the stevedore knot is one of three prime knots with crossing number six, the others being the 6 2 knot and the 6 3 knot . The stevedore knot is listed as the 6 1 knot in the Alexander–Briggs notation , and it can also be described as a twist knot with four twists, or as the (5,−1,−1) pretzel knot .  The mathematical stevedore knot is named after the common stevedore knot , which is often used as a stopper at the end of a rope . The mathematical version of the knot can be obtained from the common version by joining together the two loose ends of the rope, forming a knotted loop .  The stevedore knot is invertible but not amphichiral . Its Alexander polynomial is        Δ   (  t  )    =     -   2  t    +  5   -   2   t   -  1       ,        normal-Δ  t           2  t    5     2   superscript  t    1        \Delta(t)=-2t+5-2t^{-1},\,     its Conway polynomial is        ∇   (  z  )    =   1  -   2   z  2      ,       normal-∇  z     1    2   superscript  z  2       \nabla(z)=1-2z^{2},\,     and its Jones polynomial is        V   (  q  )    =         q  2   -  q   +  2   -   2   q   -  1      +   q   -  2     -   q   -  3     +   q   -  4      .        V  q                superscript  q  2   q   2     2   superscript  q    1       superscript  q    2      superscript  q    3      superscript  q    4       V(q)=q^{2}-q+2-2q^{-1}+q^{-2}-q^{-3}+q^{-4}.\,    1  The Alexander polynomial and Conway polynomial are the same as those for the knot 9 46 , but the Jones polynomials for these two knots are different. 2 Because the Alexander polynomial is not monic , the stevedore knot is not fibered .  The stevedore knot is a ribbon knot , and is therefore also a slice knot .  The stevedore knot is a hyperbolic knot , with its complement having a volume of approximately 3.16396.
