Modulo-N code

Modulo-N code is a lossy compression algorithm used to compress correlated data sources using modulo arithmetic.
Compression
When applied to two nodes in a network whose data are in close range of each other Modulo-N code requires one node (say odd) to send the coded data value as the raw data 
 
 
 
 ; the even node is required to send the coded data as the 
 
 
 
 . Hence the name Modulo-N code.
Since it is known that for a number K, at least 
 
 
 
  bits are required to represent it in binary. So the modulo coded data of the two nodes requires totally 
 
 
 
 
 . As we can generally expect 
 
 
 
  always, because 
 
 
 
 . This is the how compression is achieved.
A compression ratio achieved is 
 
 
 
 .
Decompression
At the receiver by joint decoding we may complete the process of extracting the data and rebuilding the original values. The code from the even node is reconstructed by the assumption that it must be close to the data from the odd node. Hence the decoding algorithm retrieves even node data as

 
 .
The decoder essentially finds the closest match to 
 
 
 
 
  and the decoded value is declared as 
 
 

Example
For a mod-8 code, we have Encoder
D_o=43,D_e=47
M_o=43,M_e=47 mod(8) = 7,

Decoder
 M_o=43,M_e=47 mod(8) = 7,
 D_o=43,D_e=CLOSEST(43,8.k + 7)
 


 D_o=43,D_e=47
Modulo-N decoding is similar to phase unwrapping and has the same limitation: If the difference from one node to the next is more than N/2 (if the phase changes from one sample to the next more than 
 
 
 
 ), then decoding leads to an incorrect value.
