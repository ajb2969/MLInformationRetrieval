   Riemann–Roch theorem for smooth manifolds      Riemann–Roch theorem for smooth manifolds   In mathematics , a Riemann–Roch theorem for smooth manifolds is a version of results such as the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem or Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem (GRR) without a hypothesis making the smooth manifolds involved carry a complex structure . Results of this kind were obtained by Michael Atiyah and Friedrich Hirzebruch in 1959, reducing the requirements to something like a spin structure .  Formulation  Let X and Y be oriented smooth closed manifolds , and f : X → Y a continuous map. Let v f = f * ( TY ) − TX in the K-group K(X). If dim(X) ≡ dim(Y) mod 2, then        ch   (    f   K  *     (  x  )    )    =    f   H  *     (   ch   (  x  )    e    d   (   v  f   )    /  2     A  ^    (   v  f   )    )     ,        ch     subscript  f   K     x       subscript  f   H       ch  x   superscript  e      d   subscript  v  f    2     normal-^  A    subscript  v  f       \mathrm{ch}(f_{K*}(x))=f_{H*}(\mathrm{ch}(x)e^{d(v_{f})/2}\hat{A}(v_{f})),   where ch is the Chern character , d(v f ) an element of the integral cohomology group  H 2 ( Y , Z ) satisfying d ( v f ) ≡ f *  w 2 (T Y )- w 2 (T X ) mod 2, f K* the Gysin homomorphism for K-theory, and f H* the Gysin homomorphism for cohomology . 1 This theorem was first proven by Atiyah and Hirzebruch. 2  The theorem is proven by considering several special cases. 3 If Y is the Thom space of a vector bundle V over X , then the Gysin maps are just the Thom isomorphism. Then, using the splitting principle , it suffices to check the theorem via explicit computation for line bundles.  If f : X → Y is an embedding, then the Thom space of the normal bundle of X in Y can be viewed as a tubular neighborhood of X in Y , and excision gives a map      u  :     H  *    (   B   (  N  )    ,   S   (  N  )    )    →    H  *    (  Y  ,   Y  -   B   (  N  )     )    →    H  *    (  Y  )        normal-:  u     normal-→     superscript  H       B  N     S  N        superscript  H     Y    Y    B  N        normal-→       superscript  H    Y       u:H^{*}(B(N),S(N))\to H^{*}(Y,Y-B(N))\to H^{*}(Y)   and      v  :    K   (   B   (  N  )    ,   S   (  N  )    )    →   K   (  Y  ,   Y  -   B   (  N  )     )    →   K   (  Y  )        normal-:  v     normal-→    K     B  N     S  N       K   Y    Y    B  N        normal-→      K  Y       v:K(B(N),S(N))\to K(Y,Y-B(N))\to K(Y)   . The Gysin map for K-theory/cohomology is defined to be the composition of the Thom isomorphism with these maps. Since the theorem holds for the map from X to the Thom space of N , and since the Chern character commutes with u and v , the theorem is also true for embeddings. f : X → Y .  Finally, we can factor a general map f : X → Y into an embedding      i  :   X  →   Y  ×   S   2  n         normal-:  i   normal-→  X    Y   superscript  S    2  n        i:X\to Y\times S^{2n}   and the projection       p  :    Y  ×   S   2  n     →  Y    .     normal-:  p   normal-→    Y   superscript  S    2  n     Y     p:Y\times S^{2n}\to Y.   The theorem is true for the embedding. The Gysin map for the projection is the Bott-periodicity isomorphism, which commutes with the Chern character, so the theorem holds in this general case also.  Corollaries  Atiyah and Hirzebruch then specialised and refined in the case X = a point, where the condition becomes the existence of a spin structure on Y . Corollaries are on Pontryagin classes and the J-homomorphism .  Notes  "  Category:Theorems in differential geometry  Category:Algebraic surfaces     M.
