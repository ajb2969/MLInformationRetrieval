   Cyclomaltodextrinase      Cyclomaltodextrinase   In enzymology , a cyclomaltodextrinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cyclomaltodextrin + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   linear maltodextrin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cyclomaltodextrin and H 2 O , whereas its product is linear maltodextrin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cyclomaltodextrin dextrin-hydrolase (decyclizing) . Other names in common use include cycloheptaglucanase , cyclohexaglucanase , and cyclodextrinase . This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
