   Palinstrophy      Palinstrophy   Palinstrophy is the curl of the vorticity . It is defined as      1  2    (   ∇  ×  ω   )    ,        1  2     normal-∇  ω     \frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla\times\omega\right),   where   ω   ω   \omega   is the vorticity.  Palinstrophy is mainly used in turbulence study, where there is a need to quantify how vorticity is transferred from one direction to the others. It is closely related to enstrophy , the latter being more equivalent to the "power" of vorticity.  References   Lesieur, Marcel. "Turbulence in fluids: stochastic and numerical modeling."
