   2-oxoaldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+)      2-oxoaldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+)   In enzymology , a 2-oxoaldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a 2-oxoaldehyde + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a 2-oxo acid + NADH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 2-oxoaldehyde , NAD + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are 2-oxo acid , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-oxoaldehyde:NAD+ 2-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include alpha-ketoaldehyde dehydrogenase , methylglyoxal dehydrogenase , NAD+-linked alpha-ketoaldehyde dehydrogenase , 2-ketoaldehyde dehydrogenase , NAD+-dependent alpha-ketoaldehyde dehydrogenase , and 2-oxoaldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+) . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism .  References       "  Category:EC 1.2.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
