   Polynomial-time algorithm for approximating the volume of convex bodies      Polynomial-time algorithm for approximating the volume of convex bodies   The paper is a joint work by Martin Dyer , Alan M. Frieze and Ravindran Kannan . 1  The main result of the paper is a randomized algorithm for finding an   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   approximation to the volume of a convex body   K   K   K   in   n   n   n   -dimensional Euclidean space by assuming the existence of a membership oracle. The algorithm takes time bounded by a polynomial in   n   n   n   , the dimension of   K   K   K   and    1  /  ϵ      1  ϵ    1/\epsilon   .  The algorithm is a sophisticated usage of the so-called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The basic scheme of the algorithm is a nearly uniform sampling from within   K   K   K   by placing a grid consisting   n   n   n   -dimensional cubes and doing a random walk over these cubes. By using the theory of rapidly mixing Markov chains , they show that it takes a polynomial time for the random walk to settle down to being a nearly uniform distribution.
