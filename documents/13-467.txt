Polynomial-time algorithm for approximating the volume of convex bodies

The paper is a joint work by Martin Dyer, Alan M. Frieze and Ravindran Kannan.1
The main result of the paper is a randomized algorithm for finding an 
 
 
 
  approximation to the volume of a convex body 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 -dimensional Euclidean space by assuming the existence of a membership oracle. The algorithm takes time bounded by a polynomial in 
 
 
 
 , the dimension of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The algorithm is a sophisticated usage of the so-called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The basic scheme of the algorithm is a nearly uniform sampling from within 
 
 
 
  by placing a grid consisting 
 
 
 
 -dimensional cubes and doing a random walk over these cubes. By using the theory of rapidly mixing Markov chains, they show that it takes a polynomial time for the random walk to settle down to being a nearly uniform distribution.
