Bishop–Gromov inequality

In mathematics, the Bishop–Gromov inequality is a comparison theorem in Riemannian geometry, named after Richard L. Bishop and Mikhail Gromov. It is closely related to Myers' theorem, and is the key point in the proof of Gromov's compactness theorem.1
Statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be a complete n-dimensional Riemannian manifold whose Ricci curvature satisfies the lower bound



for a constant 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the complete n-dimensional simply connected space of constant sectional curvature

 
  (and hence of constant Ricci curvature 
 
 
 
 ); thus 
 
 
 
  is the n-sphere of radius 
 
 
 
  if K > 0, or n-dimensional Euclidean space if 
 
 
 
 , or an appropriately rescaled version of n-dimensional hyperbolic space if 
 
 
 
 . Denote by B(p, r) the ball of radius r around a point p, defined with respect to the Riemannian distance function.
Then, for any 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the function



is non-increasing on (0, ∞).
As r goes to zero, the ratio approaches one, so together with the monotonicity this implies that


 
  This is the version first proved by Bishop,23 originally assuming the (unnecessary) added hypothesis that 
 
 
 
  is less than the injectivity radius at 
 
 
 
 .
