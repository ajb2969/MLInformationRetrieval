   Bishop–Gromov inequality      Bishop–Gromov inequality   In mathematics , the Bishop–Gromov inequality is a comparison theorem in Riemannian geometry , named after Richard L. Bishop and Mikhail Gromov . It is closely related to Myers' theorem , and is the key point in the proof of Gromov's compactness theorem . 1  Statement  Let   M   M   M   be a complete n -dimensional Riemannian manifold whose Ricci curvature satisfies the lower bound      Ric  ≥    (   n  -  1   )    K        Ric      n  1   K     \mathrm{Ric}\geq(n-1)K\,     for a constant    K  ∈  ℝ      K  ℝ    K\in\mathbb{R}   . Let    M  K  n     superscript   subscript  M  K   n    M_{K}^{n}   be the complete n -dimensional simply connected space of constant sectional curvature    K   K   K   (and hence of constant Ricci curvature     (   n  -  1   )   K        n  1   K    (n-1)K   ); thus    M  K  n     superscript   subscript  M  K   n    M_{K}^{n}   is the n - sphere of radius    1  /   K       1    K     1/\sqrt{K}   if K > 0, or n -dimensional Euclidean space if    K  =  0      K  0    K=0   , or an appropriately rescaled version of n -dimensional hyperbolic space if    K  <  0      K  0    K<0   . Denote by B ( p , r ) the ball of radius r around a point p , defined with respect to the Riemannian distance function .  Then, for any    p  ∈  M      p  M    p\in M   and     p  K   ∈   M  K  n        subscript  p  K    superscript   subscript  M  K   n     p_{K}\in M_{K}^{n}   , the function       ϕ   (  r  )    =     Vol   B   (  p  ,  r  )      Vol   B   (   p  K   ,  r  )           ϕ  r       Vol  B   p  r      Vol  B    subscript  p  K   r       \phi(r)=\frac{\mathrm{Vol}\,B(p,r)}{\mathrm{Vol}\,B(p_{K},r)}     is non-increasing on (0, ∞).  As r goes to zero, the ratio approaches one, so together with the monotonicity this implies that         Vol   B   (  p  ,  r  )    ≤    Vol   B   (   p  K   ,  r  )     .        Vol  B   p  r      Vol  B    subscript  p  K   r      \mathrm{Vol}\,B(p,r)\leq\mathrm{Vol}\,B(p_{K},r).   This is the version first proved by Bishop, 2 3 originally assuming the (unnecessary) added hypothesis that   r   r   r   is less than the injectivity radius at   p   p   p   .
