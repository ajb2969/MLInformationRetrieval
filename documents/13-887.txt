Magnetic energy

Magnetic energy and electric energy are related by Maxwell's equations. The potential energy of a magnet of magnetic moment m in a magnetic field B is defined as the mechanical work of magnetic force (actually of magnetic torque) on re-alignment of the vector of the magnetic dipole moment, and is equal:








while the energy stored in an inductor (of inductance L) when current I is passing via it is




 
 .
 



This second expression forms the basis for superconducting magnetic energy storage.
Energy is also stored in a magnetic field. The energy per unit volume in a region of space of permeability

 
  containing magnetic field B is:
