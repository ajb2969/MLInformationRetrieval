   Magnetic energy      Magnetic energy   Magnetic energy and electric energy are related by Maxwell's equations . The potential energy of a magnet of magnetic moment  m in a magnetic field  B is defined as the mechanical work of magnetic force (actually of magnetic torque ) on re-alignment of the vector of the magnetic dipole moment, and is equal:         E   p  ,  m    =   -   m  ⋅  B         subscript  E   normal-p  normal-m       normal-⋅  m  B      E_{\rm p,m}=-m\cdot B        while the energy stored in an inductor (of inductance  L ) when current I is passing via it is         E   p  ,  m    =    1  2   L   I  2         subscript  E   normal-p  normal-m        1  2   L   superscript  I  2      E_{\rm p,m}={1\over 2}LI^{2}   .     This second expression forms the basis for superconducting magnetic energy storage .  Energy is also stored in a magnetic field. The energy per unit volume in a region of space of permeability    μ   μ   \mu   containing magnetic field B is:        u  =    1  2     B  2   μ        u      1  2      superscript  B  2   μ      u={1\over 2}{B^{2}\over\mu}        See also   Magnetic motor .
