Optical unit

The Optical Unit is a dimensionless units of length used in optical microscopy. Because every diffraction limited system have their resolution proportional to wavelength / NA, it is convenient for comparison to use this unit. There are actually 2 units, one "axial" (along the optical axis of the objective) and one "radial".
Equation




where :



 
  is the refractive index


 
  is the wavelength


 
  the beam conus angle


 
  is the total magnification (
 
 
 
  is 1 if you want the size in the sample)

Note 
 
 
 
  = numerical aperture
