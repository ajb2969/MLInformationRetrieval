   Contraction principle (large deviations theory)      Contraction principle (large deviations theory)   In mathematics — specifically, in large deviations theory — the contraction principle is a theorem that states how a large deviation principle on one space " pushes forward " to a large deviation principle on another space via a continuous function .  Statement of the theorem  Let X and Y be Hausdorff  topological spaces and let ( μ ε ) ε >0 be a family of probability measures on X that satisfies the large deviation principle with rate function  I : X → [0, +∞]. Let T : X → Y be a continuous function, and let ν ε = T ∗ ( μ ε ) be the push-forward measure of μ ε by T , i.e., for each measurable set /event E ⊆ Y , ν ε ( E ) = μ ε ( T −1 ( E )). Let        J   (  y  )    :=   inf   {   I   (  x  )    |   x  ∈   X  and  T   (  x  )    =  y   }     ,     assign    J  y    infimum   conditional-set    I  x       x    X  and  T  x        y        J(y):=\inf\big\{I(x)\big|x\in X\mbox{ and }T(x)=y\big\},     with the convention that the infimum of I over the empty set ∅ is +∞. Then:   J : Y → [0, +∞] is a rate function on Y ,  J is a good rate function on Y if I is a good rate function on X , and  ( ν ε ) ε >0 satisfies the large deviation principle on Y with rate function J .
