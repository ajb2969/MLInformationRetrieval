   Martin's axiom      Martin's axiom   In the mathematical field of set theory , Martin's axiom , introduced by , is a statement that is independent of the usual axioms of ZFC set theory . It is implied by the continuum hypothesis , but it is consistent with ZFC and the negation of the continuum hypothesis. Informally, it says that all cardinals less than the cardinality of the continuum ,   𝔠   𝔠   \mathfrak{c}   , behave roughly like    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   . The intuition behind this can be understood by studying the proof of the Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma . It is a principle that is used to control certain forcing arguments.  Statement of Martin's axiom  For any cardinal k , we define a statement, denoted by MA( k ):   For any partial order  P satisfying the countable chain condition (hereafter ccc) and any family D of dense sets in P such that |D| ≤ k , there is a filter  F on P such that F ∩ d is non- empty for every d in D .   Since it is a theorem of ZFC that MA(   𝔠   𝔠   \mathfrak{c}   ) fails, Martin's axiom is stated as:   Martin's axiom (MA): For every k \mathfrak c, MA( k ) holds.   In this case (for application of ccc), an antichain is a subset A of P such that any two distinct members of A are incompatible (two elements are said to be compatible if there exists a common element below both of them in the partial order). This differs from, for example, the notion of antichain in the context of trees .  MA(    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   ) is simply true. This is known as the Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma .  MA(    2   ℵ  0      superscript  2   subscript  normal-ℵ  0     2^{\aleph_{0}}   ) is false: [0, 1] is a compact  Hausdorff space , which is separable and so ccc. It has no isolated points , so points in it are nowhere dense, but it is the union of     2   ℵ  0    =  𝔠       superscript  2   subscript  normal-ℵ  0    𝔠    2^{\aleph_{0}}=\mathfrak{c}   many points.  Equivalent forms of MA(k)  The following statements are equivalent to Martin's axiom:   If X is a compact Hausdorff topological space that satisfies the ccc then X is not the union of k or fewer nowhere dense subsets.    If P is a non-empty upwards ccc poset and Y is a family of cofinal subsets of P with |Y| ≤ k then there is an upwards directed set A such that A meets every element of Y .    Let A be a non-zero ccc Boolean algebra and F a family of subsets of A with |F| ≤ k . Then there is a boolean homomorphism φ: A → Z /2 Z such that for every X in F either there is an a in X with φ( a ) = 1 or there is an upper bound b for X with φ( b ) = 0.   Consequences  Martin's axiom has a number of other interesting combinatorial , analytic and topological consequences:   The union of k or fewer null sets in an atomless σ-finite Borel measure on a Polish space is null. In particular, the union of k or fewer subsets of R of Lebesgue measure 0 also has Lebesgue measure 0.  A compact Hausdorff space X with |X|  k is sequentially compact , i.e., every sequence has a convergent subsequence.  No non-principal ultrafilter on N has a base of cardinality < k .  Equivalently for any x in β N \ N we have χ( x ) ≥ k , where χ is the character of x , and so χ(β N ) ≥ k .  MA(    ℵ  1     subscript  normal-ℵ  1    \aleph_{1}   ) implies that a product of ccc topological spaces is ccc (this in turn implies there are no Suslin lines ).  MA + ¬CH implies that there exists a Whitehead group that is not free; Shelah used this to show that the Whitehead problem is independent of ZFC.   See also   Martin's axiom has generalizations called the proper forcing axiom and Martin's maximum .  Sheldon W.Davis has suggested in his book that Martin's axiom is motivated by Baire category theorem . 1   Notes    Jech, Thomas , 2003.
