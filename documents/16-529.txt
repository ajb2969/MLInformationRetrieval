Bishop–Phelps theorem

In mathematics, the Bishop–Phelps theorem is a theorem about the topological properties of Banach spaces named after Errett Bishop and Robert Phelps, who published its proof in 1961.
Its statement is as follows.

Let B ⊂ E be a bounded, closed, convex set of a Banach space E. Then the set
