   Bishop–Phelps theorem      Bishop–Phelps theorem   In mathematics, the Bishop–Phelps theorem is a theorem about the topological properties of Banach spaces named after Errett Bishop and Robert Phelps , who published its proof in 1961.  Its statement is as follows.   Let B ⊂ E be a bounded, closed, convex set of a Banach space E . Then the set         {    e  *   ∈   E  *    ∣    e  *   attains its supremum on  B   }     conditional-set     superscript  e     superscript  E        superscript  e    attains its supremum on  B     \{e^{*}\in E^{*}\mid e^{*}\text{ attains its supremum on }B\}         is norm-dense in the dual    E  *     superscript  E     E^{*}   .
