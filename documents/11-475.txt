   Dolichylphosphate-glucose phosphodiesterase      Dolichylphosphate-glucose phosphodiesterase   In enzymology , a dolichylphosphate-glucose phosphodiesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dolichyl beta-D-glucosyl phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dolichyl phosphate + D-glucose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dolichyl beta-D-glucosyl phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are dolichyl phosphate and D-glucose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dolichyl-beta-D-glucosyl-phosphate dolichylphosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include dolichol phosphoglucose phosphodiesterase , and Dol-P-Glc phosphodiesterase . This enzyme participates in n- glycan biosynthesis.
