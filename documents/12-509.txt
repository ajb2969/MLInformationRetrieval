   Open mapping theorem (functional analysis)      Open mapping theorem (functional analysis)   In functional analysis , the open mapping theorem , also known as the Banach–Schauder theorem (named after Stefan Banach and Juliusz Schauder ), is a fundamental result which states that if a continuous linear operator between Banach spaces is surjective then it is an open map . More precisely, :   Open Mapping Theorem. If X and Y are Banach spaces and A : X → Y is a surjective continuous linear operator, then A is an open map (i.e. if U is an open set in X , then A ( U ) is open in Y ).   The proof uses the Baire category theorem , and completeness of both X and Y is essential to the theorem. The statement of the theorem is no longer true if either space is just assumed to be a normed space , but is true if X and Y are taken to be Fréchet spaces .  Consequences  The open mapping theorem has several important consequences:   If A : X → Y is a bijective continuous linear operator between the Banach spaces X and Y , then the inverse operator  A −1 : Y → X is continuous as well (this is called the bounded inverse theorem ).  If A : X → Y is a linear operator between the Banach spaces X and Y , and if for every sequence ( x n ) in X with x n → 0 and Ax n → y it follows that y = 0, then A is continuous (the closed graph theorem ).   Proof  Suppose A : X → Y is a surjective continuous linear operator. In order to prove that A is an open map, it is sufficient to show that A maps the open unit ball in X to a neighborhood of the origin of Y .  Let     U  =    B  1  X    (  0  )     ,   V  =    B  1  Y    (  0  )        formulae-sequence    U     superscript   subscript  B  1   X   0      V     superscript   subscript  B  1   Y   0      U=B_{1}^{X}(0),V=B_{1}^{Y}(0)   . Then      X  =    ⋃   k  ∈  ℕ     k  U        X    subscript     k  ℕ      k  U      X=\bigcup_{k\in\mathbb{N}}kU   .  Since A is surjective:       Y  =   A   (  X  )    =   A   (    ⋃   k  ∈  ℕ     k  U    )    =    ⋃   k  ∈  ℕ     A   (   k  U   )      .        Y    A  X          A    subscript     k  ℕ      k  U            subscript     k  ℕ      A    k  U        Y=A(X)=A\left(\bigcup_{k\in\mathbb{N}}kU\right)=\bigcup_{k\in\mathbb{N}}A(kU).     But Y is Banach so by Baire's category theorem      ∃  k  ∈  ℕ  :    (    A   (   k  U   )    ¯   )   ∘   ≠  ∅  .     fragments   k   N  normal-:  italic-   superscript   fragments  normal-(   normal-¯    A    k  U     normal-)       normal-.    \exists k\in\mathbb{N}:\qquad\left(\overline{A(kU)}\right)^{\circ}\neq\varnothing.     That is, we have c in Y and r > 0 such that         B  r    (  c  )    ⊆    (    A   (   k  U   )    ¯   )   ∘   ⊆    A   (   k  U   )    ¯    .           subscript  B  r   c    superscript   normal-¯    A    k  U             normal-¯    A    k  U        B_{r}(c)\subseteq\left(\overline{A(kU)}\right)^{\circ}\subseteq\overline{A(kU)}.     Let v ∈ V , then        c  ,   c  +   r  v     ∈    B  r    (  c  )    ⊆    A   (   k  U   )    ¯    .         c    c    r  v        subscript  B  r   c         normal-¯    A    k  U        c,c+rv\in B_{r}(c)\subseteq\overline{A(kU)}.     By continuity of addition and linearity, the difference rv satisfies        r  v   ∈     A   (   k  U   )    ¯   +    A   (   k  U   )    ¯    ⊆     A   (   k  U   )    +   A   (   k  U   )     ¯   ⊆    A   (   2  k  U   )    ¯    ,          r  v      normal-¯    A    k  U      normal-¯    A    k  U            normal-¯      A    k  U      A    k  U            normal-¯    A    2  k  U        rv\in\overline{A(kU)}+\overline{A(kU)}\subseteq\overline{A(kU)+A(kU)}\subseteq%
 \overline{A(2kU)},     and by linearity again,       V  ⊆    A   (   L  U   )    ¯    .      V   normal-¯    A    L  U       V\subseteq\overline{A\left(LU\right)}.     where we have set L =2 k / r . It follows that      ∀  y  ∈  Y  ,  ∀  ε  >  0  ,  ∃  x  ∈  X  :  ∥  x   ∥  X   ≤  L  ∥  y   ∥  Y   and  ∥  y  -  A  x   ∥  X   <  ε  .   (  1  )      fragments  for-all  y   Y  normal-,  for-all  ε   0  normal-,   x   X  normal-:  italic-  parallel-to  x   subscript  parallel-to  X    L  parallel-to  y   subscript  parallel-to  Y    and   parallel-to  y   A  x   subscript  parallel-to  X    ε  normal-.  italic-   fragments  normal-(  1  normal-)     \forall y\in Y,\forall\varepsilon>0,\exists x\in X:\qquad\|x\|_{X}\leq L\|y\|_%
 {Y}\quad\text{and}\quad\|y-Ax\|_{X}<\varepsilon.\qquad(1)     Our next goal is to show that    V  ⊆  A   (   2  L  U   )       V  normal-⊆  A    2  L  U     V⊆A(2LU)   .  Let    y  ∈  V      y  normal-∈  V    y∈V   . By (1), there is some with x 1 {{!!}}  and y − Ax 1 {{!!}} . Define a sequence { x n } inductively as follows. Assume:      ∥   x  n   ∥  <   L   2   n  -  1     and  ∥  y  -  A   (   x  1   +   x  2   +  ⋯  +   x  n   )   ∥  <   1   2  n    .   (  2  )      fragments  parallel-to   subscript  x  n   parallel-to     L   superscript  2    n  1      and   normal-∥  y   A   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  1     subscript  x  2    normal-⋯    subscript  x  n   normal-)   normal-∥     1   superscript  2  n    normal-.  italic-   fragments  normal-(  2  normal-)     \|x_{n}\|<\frac{L}{2^{n-1}}\quad\text{and}\quad\left\|y-A(x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x%
 _{n})\right\|<\frac{1}{2^{n}}.\qquad(2)     Then by (1) we can pick so that:         ∥   x   n  +  1    ∥   <    L   2  n    and      ∥   y  -   A   (    x  1   +   x  2   +  ⋯  +   x  n    )    -   A   (   x   n  +  1    )     ∥   <   1   2   n  +  1       ,     formulae-sequence     norm   subscript  x    n  1        L   superscript  2  n    and       norm    y    A     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-⋯   subscript  x  n       A   subscript  x    n  1         1   superscript  2    n  1        \|x_{n+1}\|<\frac{L}{2^{n}}\quad\text{and}\quad\left\|y-A(x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x%
 _{n})-A(x_{n+1})\right\|<\frac{1}{2^{n+1}},     so (2) is satisfied for . Let        s  n   =    x  1   +   x  2   +  ⋯  +   x  n     .       subscript  s  n      subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-⋯   subscript  x  n      s_{n}=x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}.     From the first inequality in (2), { s n } is a Cauchy sequence , and since X is complete, s n converges to some    x  ∈  X      x  normal-∈  X    x∈X   . By (2), the sequence tends to y , and so     A  x   =  y        A  x   y    Ax=y   by continuity of A . Also,        ∥  x  ∥   =    lim   n  →  ∞     ∥   s  n   ∥    ≤    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    ∥   x  n   ∥    <   2  L    .         norm  x     subscript    normal-→  n      norm   subscript  s  n            superscript   subscript     n  1       norm   subscript  x  n            2  L      \|x\|=\lim_{n\to\infty}\|s_{n}\|\leq\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\|x_{n}\|<2L.     This shows that   y   y   y   belongs to    A   (   2  L  U   )       A    2  L  U     A(2LU)   , so    V  ⊆  A   (   2  L  U   )       V  normal-⊆  A    2  L  U     V⊆A(2LU)   as claimed. Thus the image A ( U ) of the unit ball in X contains the open ball     V  /  2   L  U        V  2   L  U    V/2LU   of Y . Hence, A ( U ) is a neighborhood of 0 in Y , and this concludes the proof.  Generalizations  Local convexity of X or Y is not essential to the proof, but completeness is: the theorem remains true in the case when X and Y are F-spaces . Furthermore, the theorem can be combined with the Baire category theorem in the following manner :   Let X be a F-space and Y a topological vector space . If    A  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  A    X  normal-→  Y     A:X→Y   is a continuous linear operator, then either A ( X ) is a meager set in Y , or A ( X ) = Y . In the latter case, A is an open mapping and Y is also an F-space.   Furthermore, in this latter case if N is the kernel of A , then there is a canonical factorization of A in the form      X  →    X  /  N    →  𝛼   Y      normal-→  X      X  N    α  normal-→   Y     X\to X/N\overset{\alpha}{\to}Y     where    X  /  N      X  N    X/N   is the quotient space (also an F-space) of X by the closed subspace N . The quotient mapping     X  →  X   /  N        X  normal-→  X   N    X→X/N   is open, and the mapping α is an isomorphism of topological vector spaces .  The open mapping theorem can also be stated as 1   Let X and Y be two F-spaces. Then every continuous linear map of X onto Y is a TVS homomorphism.   where a linear map    u  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  u    X  normal-→  Y     u:X→Y   is a topological vector space (TVS) homomorphism if the induced map     u  ^   :    X  /   ker   (  u  )     →  Y      normal-:   normal-^  u    normal-→    X   kernel  u    Y     \hat{u}:X/\ker(u)\to Y   is a TVS-isomorphism onto its image.
