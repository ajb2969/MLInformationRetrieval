   Nicotinate dehydrogenase (cytochrome)      Nicotinate dehydrogenase (cytochrome)   Nicotinate dehydrogenase ( cytochrome ) (, nicotinic acid hydroxylase , nicotinate hydroxylase ) is an enzyme with system name nicotinate:cytochrome 6-oxidoreductase (hydroxylating) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction  (Figure)  Nicotinate dehydrogenase (cytochrome).svg    nicotinate + a ferricytochrome + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   6-hydroxynicotinate + a ferrocytochrome + 2 H +   This two-component enzyme from Pseudomonas belongs to the family of xanthine dehydrogenases.
