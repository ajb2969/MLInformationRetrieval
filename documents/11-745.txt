N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase

In enzymology, a N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-glucosamine + acetate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and H2O, whereas its two products are D-glucosamine and acetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-acetyl-D-glucosamine amidohydrolase. Other names in common use include acetylaminodeoxyglucose acetylhydrolase, and N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl N-deacetylase. This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
