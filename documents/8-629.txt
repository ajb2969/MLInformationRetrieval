   Zerosumfree monoid      Zerosumfree monoid   In abstract algebra , an additive monoid     (  M  ,  0  ,  +  )     M  0     (M,0,+)   is said to be zerosumfree , conical , centerless or positive if nonzero elements do not sum to zero. Formally:       (  ∀  a  ,  b  ∈  M  )   a  +  b  =  0  ⟹  a  =  b  =   0      fragments   fragments  normal-(  for-all  a  normal-,  b   M  normal-)   a   b   0   a   b   0    (\forall a,b\in M)\ a+b=0\implies a=b=0\!     This means that the only way zero can be expressed as a sum is as    0  +  0      0  0    0+0   .  References     "  Category:Semigroup theory
