   Cahen's constant      Cahen's constant   In mathematics , Cahen's constant is defined as an infinite series of unit fractions , with alternating signs, derived from Sylvester's sequence :      C  =   ∑     (   -  1   )   i     s  i   -  1     =        1  1   -   1  2    +   1  6    -   1  42    +   1  1806    -  ⋯   ≈  0.64341054629.        C       superscript    1   i      subscript  s  i   1                      1  1     1  2      1  6      1  42      1  1806    normal-⋯        0.64341054629.     C=\sum\frac{(-1)^{i}}{s_{i}-1}=\frac{1}{1}-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{6}-\frac{1}{42%
 }+\frac{1}{1806}-\cdots\approx 0.64341054629.   By considering these fractions in pairs, we can also view Cahen's constant as a series of positive unit fractions formed from the terms in even positions of Sylvester's sequence; this series for Cahen's constant forms its greedy Egyptian expansion :      C  =   ∑   1   s   2  i      =    1  2   +   1  7   +   1  1807   +   1  10650056950807   +  ⋯         C      1   subscript  s    2  i               1  2     1  7     1  1807     1  10650056950807   normal-⋯      C=\sum\frac{1}{s_{2i}}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{1807}+\frac{1}{1065005%
 6950807}+\cdots   This constant is named after Eugène Cahen (also known for the Cahen-Mellin integral ), who first formulated and investigated its series .  Cahen's constant is known to be transcendental . It is notable as being one of a small number of naturally occurring transcendental numbers for which we know the complete continued fraction expansion: if we form the sequence   1, 1, 2, 3, 14, 129, 25298, 420984147, ...   defined by the recurrence relation       q   n  +  2    =     q  n  2    q   n  +  1     +   q  n         subscript  q    n  2         superscript   subscript  q  n   2    subscript  q    n  1      subscript  q  n      q_{n+2}=q_{n}^{2}q_{n+1}+q_{n}   then the continued fraction expansion of Cahen's constant is      [  0  ,  1  ,   q  0  2   ,   q  1  2   ,   q  2  2   ,  …  ]     0  1   superscript   subscript  q  0   2    superscript   subscript  q  1   2    superscript   subscript  q  2   2   normal-…    [0,1,q_{0}^{2},q_{1}^{2},q_{2}^{2},\ldots]   .
