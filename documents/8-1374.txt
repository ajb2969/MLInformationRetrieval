Cahen's constant

In mathematics, Cahen's constant is defined as an infinite series of unit fractions, with alternating signs, derived from Sylvester's sequence:


 
  By considering these fractions in pairs, we can also view Cahen's constant as a series of positive unit fractions formed from the terms in even positions of Sylvester's sequence; this series for Cahen's constant forms its greedy Egyptian expansion:


 
  This constant is named after Eug√®ne Cahen (also known for the Cahen-Mellin integral), who first formulated and investigated its series .
Cahen's constant is known to be transcendental . It is notable as being one of a small number of naturally occurring transcendental numbers for which we know the complete continued fraction expansion: if we form the sequence

1, 1, 2, 3, 14, 129, 25298, 420984147, ... 
 

defined by the recurrence relation


 
  then the continued fraction expansion of Cahen's constant is
