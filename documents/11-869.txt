   Beta-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein synthase II      Beta-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein synthase II   In enzymology , a beta-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein synthase II () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (Z)-hexadec-11-enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + malonyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (Z)-3-oxooctadec-13-enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + CO 2 + [acyl-carrier-protein]   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (Z)-hexadec-11-enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] and malonyl-[acyl-carrier-protein], whereas its 3 products are (Z)-3-oxooctadec-13-enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein], CO 2 , and acyl-carrier-protein .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (Z)-hexadec-11-enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]:malonyl-[acyl-carrier-pr otein] C-acyltransferase (decarboxylating) . Other names in common use include KASII , KAS II , FabF , 3-oxoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I , and beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II . This enzyme participates in fatty acid biosynthesis .
