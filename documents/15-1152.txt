   Pentalenolactone D synthase      Pentalenolactone D synthase   Pentalenolactone D synthase (, penE (gene) , pntE (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name 1-deoxy-11-oxopentalenate,NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase (pentalenolactone-D forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   1-deoxy-11-oxopentalenate + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pentalenolactone D + NADP + + H 2 O   Pentalenolactone D synthase is a FAD-dependent oxygenase.
