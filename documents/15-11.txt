   Kodaira–Spencer map      Kodaira–Spencer map   In mathematics , the Kodaira–Spencer map , introduced by Kunihiko Kodaira and Donald C. Spencer , is a map associated to a deformation of a scheme or complex manifold  X , taking a tangent space of a point of the deformation space to the first cohomology group of the sheaf of vector fields on X .  Definition  The Kodaira–Spencer map is 1      δ  :     T  0   S   →    H  1    (  X  ,   T  X   )        normal-:  δ   normal-→     subscript  T  0   S      superscript  H  1    X    T  X        \delta:T_{0}S\to H^{1}(X,TX)   where       𝒳  →  S     normal-→  𝒳  S    \mathcal{X}\to S   is a smooth proper map between complex spaces 2 (i.e., a deformation of the special fiber     X  =   𝒳  0       X   subscript  𝒳  0     X=\mathcal{X}_{0}   .)     δ   δ   \delta   is the connecting homomorphism obtained by taking a long exact cohomology sequence of the surjection       T  𝒳   |   X   →     T  0   S   ⊗   𝒪  X       normal-→   evaluated-at    T  𝒳   X    tensor-product     subscript  T  0   S    subscript  𝒪  X      T\mathcal{X}|_{X}\to T_{0}S\otimes\mathcal{O}_{X}   whose kernel is the tangent bundle    T  X      T  X    TX   .   If   v   v   v   is in     T  0   S       subscript  T  0   S    T_{0}S   , then its image    δ   (  v  )       δ  v    \delta(v)   is called the Kodaira–Spencer class of v .  The basic fact is: there is a natural bijection between isomorphisms classes of    𝒳  →  S  =   Spec   (    ℂ   [  t  ]    /   t  2    )         normal-→  𝒳  S        Spec      ℂ   delimited-[]  t     superscript  t  2        \mathcal{X}\to S=\operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[t]/t^{2})   and     H  1    (  X  ,   T  X   )        superscript  H  1    X    T  X      H^{1}(X,TX)   .
