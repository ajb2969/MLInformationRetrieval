Kodaira–Spencer map

In mathematics, the Kodaira–Spencer map, introduced by Kunihiko Kodaira and Donald C. Spencer, is a map associated to a deformation of a scheme or complex manifold X, taking a tangent space of a point of the deformation space to the first cohomology group of the sheaf of vector fields on X.
Definition
The Kodaira–Spencer map is1


 
  where



 
  is a smooth proper map between complex spaces2 (i.e., a deformation of the special fiber

 
 .)


 
  is the connecting homomorphism obtained by taking a long exact cohomology sequence of the surjection 
 
 
 
  whose kernel is the tangent bundle 
 
 
 
 .

If 
 
 
 
  is in 
 
 
 
 , then its image 
 
 
 
  is called the Kodaira–Spencer class of v.
The basic fact is: there is a natural bijection between isomorphisms classes of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
