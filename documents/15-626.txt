   Variational method (quantum mechanics)      Variational method (quantum mechanics)   In quantum mechanics , the variational method is one way of finding approximations to the lowest energy eigenstate or ground state , and some excited states. This allows calculating approximate wavefunctions such as molecular orbitals . 1 The basis for this method is the variational principle . 2 3  The method consists in choosing a "trial wavefunction " depending on one or more parameters , and finding the values of these parameters for which the expectation value of the energy is the lowest possible. The wavefunction obtained by fixing the parameters to such values is then an approximation to the ground state wavefunction, and the expectation value of the energy in that state is an upper bound to the ground state energy. The Hartree‚ÄìFock method and the Ritz method both apply the variational method. The Harris functional method is anti-variational (it is a lower bound to the energy).  Description  Suppose we are given a Hilbert space and a Hermitian operator over it called the Hamiltonian  H . Ignoring complications about continuous spectra , we look at the discrete spectrum of H and the corresponding eigenspaces of each eigenvalue Œª (see spectral theorem for Hermitian operators for the mathematical background):       ‚àë     Œª  1   ,   Œª  2    ‚àà   Spec   (  H  )       \lang    œà   Œª  1    ‚à£   œà   Œª  2     \rang   =   Œ¥    Œª  1    Œª  2        fragments   subscript       subscript  Œª  1    subscript  Œª  2      Spec  H     \lang   subscript  œà   subscript  Œª  1    normal-‚à£   subscript  œà   subscript  Œª  2    \rang    subscript  Œ¥     subscript  Œª  1    subscript  Œª  2       \sum_{\lambda_{1},\,\lambda_{2}\in\mathrm{Spec}(H)}\lang\psi_{\lambda_{1}}\mid%
 \psi_{\lambda_{2}}\rang=\delta_{\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}}     where    Œ¥   i  ,  j      subscript  Œ¥   i  j     \delta_{i,j}   is the Kronecker delta         H  ^    |   œà  Œª   ‚ü©    =   Œª   |   œà  Œª   ‚ü©     .         normal-^  H    ket   subscript  œà  Œª       Œª   ket   subscript  œà  Œª       \hat{H}\left|\psi_{\lambda}\right\rangle=\lambda\left|\psi_{\lambda}\right\rangle.     Physical states are normalized, meaning that their norm is equal to¬†1. Once again ignoring complications involved with a continuous spectrum of H , suppose it is bounded from below and that its greatest lower bound is E 0 . Suppose also that we know the corresponding state |œà>. The expectation value of H is then      ‚ü®  œà  ‚à£  H  ‚à£  œà  ‚ü©     quantum-operator-product  œà  H  œà    \displaystyle\left\langle\psi\mid H\mid\psi\right\rangle     Obviously, if we were to vary over all possible states with norm 1 trying to minimize the expectation value of H , the lowest value would be E 0 and the corresponding state would be an eigenstate of E 0 . Varying over the entire Hilbert space is usually too complicated for physical calculations, and a subspace of the entire Hilbert space is chosen, parametrized by some (real) differentiable parameters Œ± i ( i =¬†1,¬†2,¬†..., N ). The choice of the subspace is called the ansatz . Some choices of ansatzes lead to better approximations than others, therefore the choice of ansatz is important.  Let's assume there is some overlap between the ansatz and the ground state (otherwise, it's a bad ansatz). We still wish to normalize the ansatz, so we have the constraints       ‚ü®   œà   (   Œ±  i   )    ‚à£   œà   (   Œ±  i   )    ‚ü©   =  1       inner-product    œà   subscript  Œ±  i      œà   subscript  Œ±  i     1    \left\langle\psi(\alpha_{i})\mid\psi(\alpha_{i})\right\rangle=1     and we wish to minimize        Œµ   (   Œ±  i   )    =   ‚ü®   œà   (   Œ±  i   )    |  H  |   œà   (   Œ±  i   )    ‚ü©    .        Œµ   subscript  Œ±  i     quantum-operator-product    œà   subscript  Œ±  i    H    œà   subscript  Œ±  i       \varepsilon(\alpha_{i})=\left\langle\psi(\alpha_{i})|H|\psi(\alpha_{i})\right\rangle.     This, in general, is not an easy task, since we are looking for a global minimum and finding the zeroes of the partial derivatives of Œµ over Œ± i is not sufficient. If œà ( Œ± i ) is expressed as a linear combination of other functions ( Œ± i being the coefficients), as in the Ritz method , there is only one minimum and the problem is straightforward. There are other, non-linear methods, however, such as the Hartree‚ÄìFock method, that are also not characterized by a multitude of minima and are therefore comfortable in calculations.  There is an additional complication in the calculations described. As Œµ tends toward E 0 in minimization calculations, there is no guarantee that the corresponding trial wavefunctions will tend to the actual wavefunction. This has been demonstrated by calculations using a modified harmonic oscillator as a model system, in which an exactly solvable system is approached using the variational method. A wavefunction different from the exact one is obtained by use of the method described above.  Although usually limited to calculations of the ground state energy, this method can be applied in certain cases to calculations of excited states as well. If the ground state wavefunction is known, either by the method of variation or by direct calculation, a subset of the Hilbert space can be chosen which is orthogonal to the ground state wavefunction.       |  œà  ‚ü©   =    |   œà  test   ‚ü©   -    ‚ü®   œà  gr   ‚à£   œà  test   ‚ü©    |   œà  gr   ‚ü©          ket  œà      ket   subscript  œà  test       inner-product   subscript  œà  gr    subscript  œà  test     ket   subscript  œà  gr        \left|\psi\right\rangle=\left|\psi_{\text{test}}\right\rangle-\left\langle\psi%
 _{\mathrm{gr}}\mid\psi_{\text{test}}\right\rangle\left|\psi_{\text{gr}}\right\rangle     The resulting minimum is usually not as accurate as for the ground state, as any difference between the true ground state and    œà  gr     subscript  œà  gr    \psi_{\text{gr}}   results in a lower excited energy. This defect is worsened with each higher excited state.  In another formulation:        E  ground   ‚â§   ‚ü®  œï  |  H  |  œï  ‚ü©    .       subscript  E  ground    quantum-operator-product  œï  H  œï     E_{\text{ground}}\leq\left\langle\phi|H|\phi\right\rangle.     This holds for any trial œÜ since, by definition, the ground state wavefunction has the lowest energy, and any trial wavefunction will have energy greater than or equal to it.  Proof: œÜ can be expanded as a linear combination of the actual eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian (which we assume to be normalized and orthogonal):       œï  =    ‚àë  n     c  n    œà  n      .      œï    subscript   n      subscript  c  n    subscript  œà  n       \phi=\sum_{n}c_{n}\psi_{n}.\,     Then, to find the expectation value of the Hamiltonian:      ‚ü®  œï  |  H  |  œï  ‚ü©     quantum-operator-product  œï  H  œï    \displaystyle\left\langle\phi|H|\phi\right\rangle     Now, the ground state energy is the lowest energy possible, i.e.     E  n   ‚â•   E  g        subscript  E  n    subscript  E  g     E_{n}\geq E_{g}   . Therefore, if the guessed wave function œÜ is normalized:        ‚ü®  œï  |  H  |  œï  ‚ü©   ‚â•    E  g     ‚àë  n     |   c  n   |   2     =   E  g    .         quantum-operator-product  œï  H  œï      subscript  E  g     subscript   n    superscript     subscript  c  n    2           subscript  E  g      \left\langle\phi|H|\phi\right\rangle\geq E_{g}\sum_{n}|c_{n}|^{2}=E_{g}.\,     In general  For a hamiltonian H that describes the studied system and any normalizable function Œ® with arguments appropriate for the unknown wave function of the system, we define the functional        Œµ   [  Œ®  ]    =    ‚ü®  Œ®  |   H  ^   |  Œ®  ‚ü©    ‚ü®  Œ®  ‚à£  Œ®  ‚ü©     .        Œµ   delimited-[]  normal-Œ®       quantum-operator-product  normal-Œ®   normal-^  H   normal-Œ®    inner-product  normal-Œ®  normal-Œ®      \varepsilon\left[\Psi\right]=\frac{\left\langle\Psi|\hat{H}|\Psi\right\rangle}%
 {\left\langle\Psi\mid\Psi\right\rangle}.     The variational principle states that       Œµ  ‚â•   E  0       Œµ   subscript  E  0     \varepsilon\geq E_{0}   , where    E  0     subscript  E  0    E_{0}   is the lowest energy eigenstate (ground state) of the hamiltonian      Œµ  =   E  0       Œµ   subscript  E  0     \varepsilon=E_{0}   if and only if   Œ®   normal-Œ®   \Psi   is exactly equal to the wave function of the ground state of the studied system.   The variational principle formulated above is the basis of the variational method used in quantum mechanics and quantum chemistry to find approximations to the ground state .  The Harris functional method is anti-variational (it is a lower bound on the energy).  Another facet in variational principles in quantum mechanics is that since   Œ®   normal-Œ®   \Psi   and    Œ®  ‚Ä†     superscript  normal-Œ®  normal-‚Ä†    \Psi^{\dagger}   can be varied separately (a fact arising due to the complex nature of the wave function), the quantities can be varied in principle just one at a time. 4  Helium atom ground state  The helium atom consists of two electrons with mass m and electric charge¬†‚àí e , around an essentially fixed nucleus of mass M ‚â´ m and charge +2 e . The Hamiltonian for it, neglecting the fine structure , is:      H  =    -     ‚Ñè  2    2  m     (    ‚àá  1  2   +   ‚àá  2  2    )     -     e  2    4  œÄ   œµ  0      (     2   r  1    +   2   r  2     -   1   |    ùê´  1   -   ùê´  2    |     )         H           superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2     2  m       superscript   subscript  normal-‚àá  1   2    superscript   subscript  normal-‚àá  2   2           superscript  e  2     4  œÄ   subscript  œµ  0           2   subscript  r  1      2   subscript  r  2       1       subscript  ùê´  1    subscript  ùê´  2           H=-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}(\nabla_{1}^{2}+\nabla_{2}^{2})-\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi%
 \epsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{2}{r_{1}}+\frac{2}{r_{2}}-\frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_{1}-%
 \mathbf{r}_{2}|}\right)   where ƒß is the reduced Planck constant , Œµ 0 is the vacuum permittivity , r i (for i = 1, 2) is the distance of the i -th electron from the nucleus, and | r 1 ‚àí r 2 | is the distance between the two electrons.  If the term V ee = e 2 /(4œÄ Œµ 0 | r 1 ‚àí r 2 |), representing the repulsion between the two electrons, were excluded, the Hamiltonian would become the sum of two hydrogen-like atom Hamiltonians with nuclear charge +2 e . The ground state energy would then be 8 E 1 = ‚àí109¬†eV, where E 1 is the Rydberg constant , and its ground state wavefunction would be the product of two wavefunctions for the ground state of hydrogen-like atoms: 5        œà   (   ùê´  1   ,   ùê´  2   )    =     Z  3    œÄ   a  0  3      e   -    Z   (    r  1   +   r  2    )    /   a  0        .        œà    subscript  ùê´  1    subscript  ùê´  2          superscript  Z  3     œÄ   superscript   subscript  a  0   3      superscript  e        Z     subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2      subscript  a  0         \psi(\mathbf{r}_{1},\mathbf{r}_{2})=\frac{Z^{3}}{\pi a_{0}^{3}}e^{-Z(r_{1}+r_{%
 2})/a_{0}}.   where a 0 is the Bohr radius and Z = 2, helium's nuclear charge. The expectation value of the total Hamiltonian H (including the term V ee ) in the state described by œà 0 will be an upper bound for its ground state energy. ee > is ‚àí5 E 1 /2 = 34¬†eV, so is 8 E 1 ‚àí¬†5 E'' 1 /2 = ‚àí75¬†eV.  A tighter upper bound can be found by using a better trial wavefunction with 'tunable' parameters. Each electron can be thought to see the nuclear charge partially "shielded" by the other electron, so we can use a trial wavefunction equal with an "effective" nuclear charge Z \langle H \rangle = \left[-2Z^2 + \frac{27}{4}Z\right] E_1  This is minimal for Z = 27/16; Shielding reduces the effective charge to ~1.69. Substituting this value of Z into the expression for H yields 729 E 1 /128 = ‚àí77.5¬†eV, within 2% of the experimental value, ‚àí78.975¬†eV. 6  Even closer estimations of this energy have been found using more complicated trial wave functions with more parameters. This is done in physical chemistry via Variational Monte Carlo .
