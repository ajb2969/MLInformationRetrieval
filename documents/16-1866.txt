De-sparsified lasso

De-sparsified lasso contributes to construct confidence intervals and statistical tests for single or low-dimensional components of a large parameter vector in high-dimensional model.1

  with 
 
 
 
  design matrix 
 
 
 
  (
 
 
 
  vectors 
 
 
 
 ), 
 
 
 
  independent of 
 
 
 
  and unknown regression 
 
 
 
  vector 
 
 
 
 .
The usual method to find the parameter is by Lasso: 
 
 

The de-sparsified lasso is a method modified from the Lasso estimator which fulfills the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions2 is as follows:



where 
 
 
 
  is an arbitrary matrix. The matrix 
 
 
 
  is generated using a surrogate inverse covariance matrix.
2 Generalized linear model
Desparsifying 
 
 
 
 -norm penalized estimators and corresponding theory can also be applied to models with convex loss functions such as generalized linear models.
Consider the following 
 
 
 
 vectors of covariables 
 
 
 
  and univariate responses 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 

we have a loss function 
 
 
 
  which is assumed to be strictly convex function in 
 
 

The 
 
 
 
 -norm regularized estimator is 
 
 

Similarly, the Lasso for node wise regression with matrix input is defined as follows: Denote by 
 
 
 
  a matrix which we want to approximately invert using nodewise lasso.
The de-sparsified 
 
 
 
 -norm regularized estimator is as follows: 
 
 

where 
 
 
 
  denotes the 
 
 
 
 th row of 
 
 
 
  without the diagonal element 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the sub matrix without the 
 
 
 
 th row and 
 
 
 
 th column.
