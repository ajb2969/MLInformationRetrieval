Maximum theorem




Maximum theorem

The maximum theorem provides conditions for the continuity of an optimized function and the set of its maximizers as a parameter changes. The statement was first proven by Claude Berge in 1959.1 The theorem is primarily used in mathematical economics.
Statement of theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be metric spaces, 
 
 
 
  be a function jointly continuous in its two arguments, and 
 
 
 
  be a compact-valued correspondence.
For 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , let


 
  and


 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is continuous (i.e. both upper and lower hemicontinuous) at some 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is continuous at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is non-empty, compact-valued, and upper hemicontinuous at 
 
 
 
 .
Interpretation
The theorem is typically interpreted as providing conditions for a parametric optimization problem to have continuous solutions with regard to the parameter. In this case, 
 
 
 
  is the parameter space, 
 
 
 
  is the function to be maximized, and 
 
 
 
  gives the constraint set that 
 
 
 
  is maximized over. Then, 
 
 
 
  is the maximized value of the function and 
 
 
 
  is the set of points that maximize 
 
 
 
 .
The result is that if the elements of an optimization problem are sufficiently continuous, then some, but not all, of that continuity is preserved in the solutions.
Proof
The proof relies primarily on the sequential definitions of upper and lower hemicontinuity.
Because 
 
 
 
  is compact-valued and 
 
 
 
  is continuous, the extreme value theorem guarantees the constrained maximum of 
 
 
 
  is well-defined and 
 
 
 
  is non-empty for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . Then, let 
 
 
 
  be a sequence converging to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be a sequence in 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  is upper hemicontinuous, there exists a convergent subsequence 
 
 
 
 .
If it is shown that 
 
 
 
 , then


 
  which would simultaneously prove the continuity of 
 
 
 
  and the upper hemicontinuity of 
 
 
 
 .
Suppose to the contrary that 
 
 
 
 , i.e. there exists an 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . Because 
 
 
 
  is lower hemicontinuous, there is a further subsequence of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . By the continuity of 
 
 
 
  and the contradiction hypothesis,


 
 . But this implies that for sufficiently large 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  which would mean 
 
 
 
  is not a maximizer, a contradiction of 
 
 
 
 . This establishes the continuity of 
 
 
 
  and the upper hemicontinuity of 
 
 
 
 .
Because 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is compact, it is sufficient to show 
 
 
 
  is closed-valued for it to be compact-valued. This can be done by contradiction using sequences similar to above.
Variants
If in addition to the conditions above, 
 
 
 
  is quasiconcave in 
 
 
 
  for each 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is convex-valued, then 
 
 
 
  is also convex-valued. If 
 
 
 
  is strictly quasiconcave in 
 
 
 
  for each 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is convex-valued, then 
 
 
 
  is single-valued, and thus is a continuous function rather than a correspondence.
If 
 
 
 
  is concave and 
 
 
 
  has a convex graph, then 
 
 
 
  is concave and 
 
 
 
  is convex-valued. Similarly to above, if 
 
 
 
  is strictly concave, then 
 
 
 
  is a continuous function.2
Examples
Consider a utility maximization problem where a consumer makes a choice from their budget set. Translating from the notation above to the standard consumer theory notation,



 
  is the space of all bundles of 
 
 
 
  commodities,


 
  represents the price vector of the commodities 
 
 
 
  and the consumer's wealth 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  is the consumer's utility function, and


 
  is the consumer's budget set.

Then,



 
  is the indirect utility function and


 
  is the Marshallian demand.

Proofs in general equilibrium theory often apply the Brouwer or Kakutani fixed point theorems to the consumer's demand, which require compactness and continuity, and the maximum theorem provides the sufficient conditions to do so.
