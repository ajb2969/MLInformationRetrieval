Pentalenic acid synthase (, CYP105D7, sav7469 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 1-deoxypentalenate,reduced ferredoxin:O2 oxidoreductase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

1-deoxypentalenate + reduced ferredoxin + O2

pentalenate + oxidized ferredoxin + H2O
 

Pentalenic acid synthase is a heme-thiolate enzyme (P-450).
