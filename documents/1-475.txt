There have been two script forms in use; the original old Hebrew script is known as the paleo-Hebrew script (which has been largely preserved, in an altered form, in the Samaritan script ), while the present "square" form of the Hebrew alphabet is a stylized form of the Aramaic script . Various "styles" (in current terms, "fonts") of representation of the letters exist. There is also a cursive Hebrew script, which has also varied over time and place.  The Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters. It does not have case , but five letters have different forms when used at the end of a word. Hebrew is written from right to left . Originally, the alphabet was an abjad consisting only of consonants . As with other abjads, such as the Arabic alphabet , scribes later devised means of indicating vowel sounds by separate vowel points, known in Hebrew as niqqud . In rabbinic Hebrew, the letters  are also used as matres lectionis (the use of certain consonants to indicate a vowel) to represent vowels. When used to write Yiddish , the writing system is a true alphabet (except for borrowed Hebrew words). In modern usage of the alphabet, as in the case of Yiddish (except that  replaces ) and to some extent modern Israeli Hebrew , vowels may be indicated. Today, the trend is toward full spelling with these letters acting as true vowels.  History  According to contemporary scholars, the original Hebrew script developed during the late second and first millennia BCE alongside others used in the region. A distinct Hebrew variant of the Phoenician script , called by scholars the paleo-Hebrew alphabet , emerged by the 10th century BCE, 1 examples of which are represented in the Gezer calendar and the Siloam inscription . (The Phoenician script probably also gave rise to the use of Greek alphabetic writing in Ancient Greece ).  The paleo-Hebrew alphabet was commonly used in the ancient Israelite kingdoms of Israel and Judah . Following the exile of the Kingdom of Judah in the 6th century BCE, in the Babylonian exile , Jews began using a form of the Assyrian Aramaic script , which was another offshoot of the same family of scripts. The Samaritans , who remained in the Land of Israel, continued to use the paleo-Hebrew alphabet. During the 3rd century BCE, Jews began to use a stylized, "square" form of the Aramaic alphabet that was used by the Persian Empire (and which in turn had been adopted from the Assyrians ), 2 while the Samaritans continued to use a form of the paleo-Hebrew script, called the Samaritan script . After the fall of the Persian Empire in 330 BCE, Jews used both scripts before settling on the Assyrian form. For a limited time thereafter Jews retained the paleo-Hebrew script only to write the Tetragrammaton , but soon that custom was also abandoned.  The square Hebrew alphabet was later adapted and used for writing languages of the Jewish diaspora – such as Karaim , Judeo-Arabic , Ladino , Yiddish, etc. The Hebrew alphabet continued in use for scholarly writing in Hebrew and came again into everyday use with the rebirth of the Hebrew language as a spoken language in the 18th and 19th centuries, especially in Palestine.    Description  General  In the traditional form, the Hebrew alphabet is an abjad consisting only of consonants , written from right to left . It has 22 letters, five of which use different forms at the end of a word.  Vowels  In the traditional form, vowels are indicated by the weak consonants  Aleph (), He (), Vav (), or Yodh () serving as vowel letters, or matres lectionis : the letter is combined with a previous vowel and becomes silent, or by imitation of such cases in the spelling of other forms. Also, a system of vowel points to indicate vowels (diacritics), called niqqud , was developed. In modern forms of the alphabet, as in the case of Yiddish and to some extent modern Israeli Hebrew , vowels may be indicated. Today, the trend is toward full spelling with the weak letters acting as true vowels.  When used to write Yiddish , vowels are indicated, using certain letters, either with or without niqqud-diacritics (e.g., respectively: "אָ", "יִ" or "י", "ע"), except for Hebrew words, which in Yiddish are written in their Hebrew spelling.  To preserve the proper vowel sounds, scholars developed several different sets of vocalization and diacritical symbols called niqqud (, literally "applying points"). One of these, the Tiberian system , eventually prevailed. Aaron ben Moses ben Asher , and his family for several generations, are credited for refining and maintaining the system. These points are normally used only for special purposes, such as Biblical books intended for study, in poetry or when teaching the language to children. The Tiberian system also includes a set of cantillation marks, called " trope ", used to indicate how scriptural passages should be chanted in synagogue recitations of scripture (although these marks do not appear in the scrolls). In everyday writing of modern Hebrew, niqqud are absent; however, patterns of how words are derived from Hebrew roots (called shorashim, or root letters ) allow Hebrew speakers to determine the vowel-structure of a given word from its consonants based on the word's context and part of speech.  Alphabet  Neither the old Hebrew script nor the modern Hebrew script have case , but five letters have special final forms , called sofit (, meaning in this context "final" or "ending") form, used only at the end of a word, somewhat as in the Greek or in the Arabic and Mandaic alphabets . These are shown below the normal form in the following table (letter names are Unicode standard 3 4 ). Although Hebrew is read and written from right to left, the following table shows the letters in order from left to right.

For the five letters that have a different final form used at the end of words, the final forms are displayed beneath the regular form.  The three lettering variants currently in use are block, cursive and Rashi. Block and Rashi are used in books. Block lettering dominates, with Rashi lettering typically used for certain editorial inserts (as in the glosses of Isserles to the Shulchan Aruch) or biblical commentaries (as in the commentary of Rashi) in various standard literary works. Cursive is used almost exclusively when handwriting, unless block lettering is desired for stylistic purposes (as in signage).

They are not used in Hebrew, aside from in loan words.       The rafe () diacritic is no longer regularly used in Hebrew. In masoretic manuscripts and some other older texts the soft fricative consonants and sometimes matres lectionis are indicated by a small line on top of the letter. Its use has been largely discontinued in modern printed texts. It is still used to mark fricative consonants in the YIVO orthography of Yiddish .     Numeric values of letters  Hebrew letters are used to denote numbers, nowadays used only in specific contexts, e.g. denoting dates in the Hebrew calendar , denoting grades of school in Israel, other listings (e.g. שלב א׳, שלב ב׳ – "phase a, phase b"), commonly in Kabbalah ( Jewish  mysticism ) in a practice known as gematria , and often in religious contexts.

Adding a geresh ("׳") to a letter multiplies its value by one thousand, for example, the year 5769 is portrayed as ה׳תשס״ט, where ה represents 5000, and תשס״ט represents 769.  Transliterations and transcriptions  The following table lists transliterations and transcriptions of Hebrew letters used in Modern Hebrew .  Clarifications:   For some letters, the Academy of the Hebrew Language offers a precise transliteration that differs from the regular standard it has set. When omitted, no such precise alternative exists and the regular standard applies.  The IPA  phonemic transcription is specified whenever it uses a different symbol from the one used for the regular standard Israeli transliteration.  The IPA  phonetic transcription is specified whenever it differs from IPA phonemic transcription.   Note: SBL's transliteration system, recommended in its Handbook of Style , 10 differs slightly from the 2006 precise transliteration system of the Academy of the Hebrew Language; for " צ " SBL uses "" (≠ AHL ""), and for בג״ד כפ״ת with no dagesh, SBL uses the same symbols as for with dagesh (i.e. "b", "g", "d", "k", "f", "t").

To the eye of readers orientating themselves on Latin (or similar) alphabets, these letters might seem to be transliterated as vowel letters; however, these are in fact transliterations of the vowel diacritics – niqqud (or are representations of the spoken vowels). E.g., in אִם ("if", ), אֵם ("mother", ) and אֹם (" nut ", ), the letter א always represents the same consonant:  ( glottal stop ), whereas the vowels /i/, /e/ and /o/ respectively represent the spoken vowel, whether it is orthographically denoted by diacritics or not. Since the Academy of the Hebrew Language ascertains that א in initial position is not transliterated, the symbol for the glottal stop is omitted from the transliteration, and only the subsequent vowels are transliterated (whether or not their corresponding vowel diacritics appeared in the text being transliterated), resulting in "im", "em" and "om", respectively.  B 123 The diacritic  geresh – "׳" – is used with some other letters as well (ד׳, ח׳, ט׳, ע׳, ר׳, ת׳), but only to transliterate from other languages to Hebrew – never to spell Hebrew words; therefore they were not included in this table (correctly translating a Hebrew text with these letters would require using the spelling in the language from which the transliteration to Hebrew was originally made). The non-standard "ו׳" and "וו"  are sometimes used to represent , which like ,  and  appears in Hebrew slang and loanwords.  C 12 The Sound  (as "ch" in loch ) is often transcribed "ch", inconsistently with the guidelines specified by the Academy of the Hebrew Language: חם  → "cham"; סכך  → "schach".  D Although the Bible does include a single occurrence of a final pe with a dagesh ( Book of Proverbs 30, 6: ""), in modern Hebrew  is always represented by pe in its regular, not final, form "פ", even when in final word position, which occurs with loanwords (e.g. שׁוֹפּ "shop" ), foreign names (e.g. פִילִיפּ "Philip" ) and some slang (e.g. חָרַפּ "slept deeply" ).  Pronunciation  The descriptions that follow are based on the pronunciation of modern standard Israeli Hebrew.

They are not mutually allophonic . When vowel diacritics are used, the two phonemes are differentiated with a shin -dot or sin -dot; the shin -dot is above the upper-right side of the letter, and the sin -dot is above the upper-left side of the letter.      Symbol   Name   Transliteration   IPA   Example       (right dot)   shin   sh    sh op      (left dot)   sin   s    s our     Historically, left-dot-sin corresponds to Proto-Semitic *, which in biblical-Judaic-Hebrew corresponded to a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative , as is evident in Greek transliteration of Hebrew words such as Balsam () (the ls - 'שׂ') as is evident in the Targum Onkelos . Rendering of proto-semitic * as , is still evident in the Soqotri language .  Dagesh  Historically, the consonants beth , gimel , daleth , kaf , pe and tav each had two sounds: one hard ( plosive ), and one soft ( fricative ), depending on the position of the letter and other factors. When vowel diacritics are used, the hard sounds are indicated by a central dot called dagesh (), while the soft sounds lack a dagesh . In modern Hebrew, however, the dagesh only changes the pronunciation of beth , kaf , and pe , and doesn't affect the name of the letter. The differences are as follows:      Name   With dagesh   Without dagesh       Symbol   Transliteration   IPA     beth     b     kaf   19   k     pe     p     In other dialects (mainly liturgical) there are variations from this pattern.   In some Sephardi and Mizrahi dialects, bet without dagesh is pronounced , like bet with dagesh  In Syrian and Yemenite Hebrew , gimel without dagesh is pronounced .  In Yemenite Hebrew, and in the Iraqi pronunciation of the word "Adonai", dalet without dagesh is pronounced  as in "these"  In Ashkenazi Hebrew , tav without dagesh is pronounced  as in "silk"  In Iraqi and Yemenite Hebrew , and formerly in some other dialects, tav without dagesh is pronounced  is in "thick"   Identical pronunciation  In Israel 's general population, many consonants have the same pronunciation. They are as follows:      ! style="text-align:center;" Letters   Transliteration   Pronunciation (IPA)        Alef *   1= ע }}   Ayin *   not transliterated     When in initial or final word position, sometimes also in medial word position:  silent     style="line-height:75%" alternatingly     ' or ’    ( glottal stop )      Bet (without dagesh )   style="text-align:center;"  Vav   v      Het   style="text-align:center;"  Kaf (without dagesh )   kh/ch/h      Tet   style="text-align:center;"  Tav   t      Kaf (with dagesh )   style="text-align:center;"  Qof   k      Samekh    Sin (with left dot)   s      Tsadi *    Tav-Samekh *   and      Tsadi (with geresh)    Tet-Shin *   and     * Varyingly  Ancient Hebrew pronunciation  Some of the variations in sound mentioned above are due to a systematic feature of Ancient Hebrew. The six consonants  were pronounced differently depending on their position. These letters were also called BeGeD KeFeT letters . The full details are very complex; this summary omits some points. They were pronounced as plosives at the beginning of a syllable, or when doubled. They were pronounced as fricatives when preceded by a vowel (commonly indicated with a macron, ). The plosive and double pronunciations were indicated by the dagesh . In Modern Hebrew the sounds  and  have reverted to  and , respectively, and  has become , so only the remaining three consonants  show variation. resh may have also been a "doubled" letter, making the list BeGeD KePoReS . ( Sefer Yetzirah , 4:1)    chet and ayin represented pharyngeal  fricatives , tsadi represented the emphatic consonant , tet represented the emphatic consonant , and qof represented the uvular plosive . All these are common Semitic  consonants .   sin (the  variant of shin ) was originally different from both shin and samekh , but had become  the same as samekh by the time the vowel pointing was devised. Because of cognates with other Semitic languages , this phoneme is known to have originally been a lateral consonant , most likely the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative (the sound of modern Welsh  ll ) or the voiceless alveolar lateral affricate (like Náhuatl  tl ).   Vowels  Matres lectionis  alef , he , vav and yod are letters that can sometimes indicate a vowel instead of a consonant (which would be, respectively, ). When they do,  and  are considered to constitute part of the vowel designation in combination with a niqqud symbol – a vowel diacritic (whether or not the diacritic is marked), whereas  and  are considered to be mute, their role being purely indicative of the non-marked vowel.

In Hebrew, all forms of niqqud are often omitted in writing, except for children's books, prayer books, poetry, foreign words, and words which would be ambiguous to pronounce.

Note 2: The pronunciation of zeire and sometimes segol – with or without the letter yod – is sometimes ei in Modern Hebrew. This is not correct in the normative pronunciation and not consistent in the spoken language. 20  Note 3: The dagesh , mappiq , and shuruk have different functions, even though they look the same.  Note 4: The letter ו ( vav ) is used since it can only be represented by that letter.  Meteg  By adding a vertical line (called Meteg ) underneath the letter and to the left of the vowel point, the vowel is made long. The meteg is only used in Biblical Hebrew , not Modern Hebrew .  Sh'va  By adding two vertical dots (called Sh'va ) underneath the letter, the vowel is made very short.      ! Name   ! Symbol   !

Geresh also is the name of one of the notes of cantillation in the reading of the Torah , but its appearance and function is different.  Religious use  The letters of the Hebrew alphabet have played varied roles in Jewish religious literature over the centuries, primarily in mystical texts. Some sources in classical rabbinical literature seem to acknowledge the historical provenance of the currently used Hebrew alphabet and deal with them as a mundane subject (the Jerusalem Talmud , for example, records that "the Israelites took for themselves square calligraphy", and that the letters "came with the Israelites from Ashur [Assyria]"); 22 others attribute mystical significance to the letters, connecting them with the process of creation or the redemption . In mystical conceptions, the alphabet is considered eternal, pre-existent to the Earth, and the letters themselves are seen as having holiness and power, sometimes to such an extent that several stories from the Talmud illustrate the idea that they cannot be destroyed. 23  The idea of the letters' creative power finds its greatest vehicle in the Sefer Yezirah , or Book of Creation , a mystical text of uncertain origin which describes a story of creation highly divergent from that in the Book of Genesis , largely through exposition on the powers of the letters of the alphabet. The supposed creative powers of the letters are also referenced in the Talmud and Zohar . 24 25  Another book, the 13th-century Kabbalistic text Sefer HaTemunah , holds that a single letter of unknown pronunciation, held by some to be the four-pronged shin on one side of the teffilin box, is missing from the current alphabet. The world's flaws, the book teaches, are related to the absence of this letter, the eventual revelation of which will repair the universe . 26 Another example of messianic significance attached to the letters is the teaching of Rabbi Eliezer that the five letters of the alphabet with final forms hold the "secret of redemption". 27  In addition, the letters occasionally feature in aggadic portions of non-mystical rabbinic literature. In such aggada the letters are often given anthropomorphic qualities and depicted as speaking to God. Commonly their shapes are used in parables to illustrate points of ethics or theology. An example from the Babylonian Talmud (a parable intended to discourage speculation about the universe before creation):  Extensive instructions about the proper methods of forming the letters are found in Mishnat Soferim, within Mishna Berura of Yisrael Meir Kagan .  Mathematical use  See aleph number and beth number and gimel function .  In set theory ,    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   , pronounced aleph-naught or aleph-zero, is used to mark the cardinal number of an infinite countable set , such as   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   , the set of all integers. More generally, the    ℵ  n     subscript  normal-ℵ  n    \aleph_{n}   (aleph) notation marks the ordered sequence of all distinct infinite cardinal numbers.  Less frequently used, the    ℶ  n     subscript  normal-ℶ  n    \beth_{n}   (beth) notation is used for the iterated power sets of    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   . The 2nd element    ℶ  1     subscript  normal-ℶ  1    \beth_{1}   is the cardinality of the continuum . Very occasionally, gimel is used in cardinal notation.  Unicode and HTML  The Unicode Hebrew block extends from U+0590 to U+05FF and from U+FB1D to U+FB4F. It includes letters , ligatures , combining diacritical marks ( niqqud and cantillation marks) and punctuation . 28 The Numeric Character References is included for HTML. These can be used in many markup languages, and they are often used in Wiki to create the Hebrew glyphs compatible with the majority of web browsers.

The same goes with the Mandaic ones , except for three of the 22 letters, which have only one form.  c In forms of Hebrew older than Modern Hebrew, כ״ף , בי״ת and פ״א can only be read b , k and p , respectively, at the beginning of a word, while they will have the sole value of v , kh and f in a sofit (final) position, with few exceptions. 29 In medial positions, both pronunciations are possible. In Modern Hebrew this restriction is not absolute, e.g. פִיזִיקַאי  and never  (= "physicist"), סְנוֹבּ  and never  (= "snob"). A dagesh may be inserted to unambiguously denote the plosive variant: בּ = , כּ = , פּ =; similarly (though today very rare in Hebrew and common only in Yiddish ) a rafé placed above the letter unambiguously denotes the fricative variant: בֿ = , כֿ =  and פֿ = . In Modern Hebrew  orthography , the sound  at the end of a word is denoted by the regular form "פ", as opposed to the final form "ף", which always denotes  (see table of transliterations and transcriptions , comment).  d However, וו (two separate vavs), used in Ktiv male , is to be distinguished from the Yiddish ligature װ (also two vavs but together as one character).  e1e2e3e4e5 The Academy of the Hebrew Language states that both  and  be indistinguishably represented in Hebrew using the letter Vav. 30 Sometimes the Vav is indeed doubled, however not to denote  as opposed to  but rather, when spelling without niqqud , to denote the phoneme /v/ at a non-initial and non-final position in the word, whereas a single Vav at a non-initial and non-final position in the word in spelling without niqqud denotes one of the phonemes /u/ or /o/. To pronounce foreign words and loanwords containing the sound , Hebrew readers must therefore rely on former knowledge and context.  References  Bibliography    ff.  Hoffman, Joel M. 2004.
