Sommerfeld parameter

The Sommerfeld parameter

 
  is a dimensionless quantity used in nuclear astrophysics in the calculation of reaction rates between two nuclei and also appears in the definition of the astrophysical S-factor. It is defined as1


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the elementary charge,  and  are the atomic numbers of two interacting nuclides, and 
 
 
 
  is the magnitude of the relative incident velocity.
One of its best-known applications is in the exponent of the Gamow factor

 
 ,


 
 ,
which is the probability of an s-wave proton to penetrate the Coulomb barrier.
One of the first articles in which the Sommerfeld parameter appeared was published in 1967.2
