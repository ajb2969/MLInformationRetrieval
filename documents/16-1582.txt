   Sommerfeld parameter      Sommerfeld parameter   The Sommerfeld parameter    η   η   η   is a dimensionless quantity used in nuclear astrophysics in the calculation of reaction rates between two nuclei and also appears in the definition of the astrophysical S-factor . It is defined as 1      η  =     Z  1    Z  2    e  2     4  π   ϵ  0   ℏ  v        η       subscript  Z  1    subscript  Z  2    superscript  e  2      4  π   subscript  ϵ  0   Planck-constant-over-2-pi  v      \eta=\frac{Z_{1}Z_{2}e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\hbar v}   ,  where   e   e   e   is the elementary charge , and are the atomic numbers of two interacting nuclides, and   v   v   v   is the magnitude of the relative incident velocity .  One of its best-known applications is in the exponent of the Gamow factor    P   P   P   ,      P  =   exp   (   -   2  π  η    )        P        2  π  η       P=\exp(-2\pi\eta)   ,  which is the probability of an s-wave proton to penetrate the Coulomb barrier .  One of the first articles in which the Sommerfeld parameter appeared was published in 1967. 2  References    "  Category:Nuclear physics  Category:Astrophysics     ↩  ↩
