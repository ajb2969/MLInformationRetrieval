   D-inositol-3-phosphate glycosyltransferase      D-inositol-3-phosphate glycosyltransferase   D-inositol-3-phosphate glycosyltransferase (, mycothiol glycosyltransferases , MshA ) is an enzyme with system name UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:1D-myo-inositol 3-phosphate alpha-D-glycosyltransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + 1D-myo-inositol 3-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-1D-myo-inositol 3-phosphate + UDP   This enzyme catalyses the first dedicated reaction in the biosynthesis of mycothiol .
