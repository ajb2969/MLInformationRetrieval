   Basu's theorem      Basu's theorem   In statistics , Basu's theorem states that any boundedly complete  sufficient statistic is independent of any ancillary statistic . This is a 1955 result of Debabrata Basu . 1  It is often used in statistics as a tool to prove independence of two statistics, by first demonstrating one is complete sufficient and the other is ancillary, then appealing to the theorem. 2 An example of this is to show that the sample mean and sample variance of a normal distribution are independent statistics, which is done in the Examples section below. This property (independence of sample mean and sample variance) characterizes normal distributions.  Statement  Let P θ be a family of distributions on a measurable space ( X, Σ ). Then if T is a boundedly complete sufficient statistic for θ , and A is ancillary to θ , then T is independent of A .  Proof  Let P θ T and P θ A be the marginal distributions of T and A respectively.       P  θ  A    (  B  )   =   P  θ    (   A   -  1    B  )   =   ∫   T   (  X  )      P  θ    (   A   -  1    B  |  T  =  t  )    P  θ  T    (  d  t  )      fragments   superscript   subscript  P  θ   A    fragments  normal-(  B  normal-)     subscript  P  θ    fragments  normal-(   superscript  A    1    B  normal-)     subscript     T  X     subscript  P  θ    fragments  normal-(   superscript  A    1    B  normal-|  T   t  normal-)    superscript   subscript  P  θ   T    fragments  normal-(  d  t  normal-)     P_{\theta}^{A}(B)=P_{\theta}(A^{-1}B)=\int_{T(X)}P_{\theta}(A^{-1}B|T=t)\ P_{%
 \theta}^{T}(dt)\,     The P θ A does not depend on θ because A is ancillary. Likewise, P θ (·| T = t ) does not depend on θ because T is sufficient. Therefore:       ∫   T   (  X  )      [  P   (   A   -  1    B  |  T  =  t  )   -   P  A    (  B  )   ]    P  θ  T    (  d  t  )   =   0      fragments   subscript     T  X     fragments  normal-[  P   fragments  normal-(   superscript  A    1    B  normal-|  T   t  normal-)     superscript  P  A    fragments  normal-(  B  normal-)   normal-]    superscript   subscript  P  θ   T    fragments  normal-(  d  t  normal-)    0    \int_{T(X)}\big[P(A^{-1}B|T=t)-P^{A}(B)\big]\ P_{\theta}^{T}(dt)=0\,     Note the integrand (the function inside the integral) is a function of t and not θ . Therefore, since T is boundedly complete:      P   (   A   -  1    B  |  T  =  t  )   =   P  A    (  B  )   for all   t      fragments  P   fragments  normal-(   superscript  A    1    B  normal-|  T   t  normal-)     superscript  P  A    fragments  normal-(  B  normal-)    for all  t    P(A^{-1}B|T=t)=P^{A}(B)\quad\text{for all }t\,     Therefore, A is independent of T .  Example  Independence of sample mean and sample variance of a normal distribution  Let X 1 , X 2 , ..., X n be independent, identically distributed  normal  random variables with mean  μ and variance  σ 2 .  Then with respect to the parameter μ , one can show that        μ  ^   =    ∑   X  i    n    ,       normal-^  μ        subscript  X  i    n     \widehat{\mu}=\frac{\sum X_{i}}{n},\,     the sample mean, is a complete sufficient statistic – it is all the information one can derive to estimate μ, and no more – and         σ  ^   2   =    ∑    (    X  i   -   X  ¯    )   2     n  -  1     ,       superscript   normal-^  σ   2        superscript     subscript  X  i    normal-¯  X    2      n  1      \widehat{\sigma}^{2}=\frac{\sum\left(X_{i}-\bar{X}\right)^{2}}{n-1},\,     the sample variance, is an ancillary statistic – its distribution does not depend on μ.  Therefore, from Basu's theorem it follows that these statistics are independent.  This independence result can also be proven by Cochran's theorem .  Further, this property (that the sample mean and sample variance of the normal distribution are independent) characterizes the normal distribution – no other distribution has this property. 3  Notes  References    Mukhopadhyay, Nitis (2000).
