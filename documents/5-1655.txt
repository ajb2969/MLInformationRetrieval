   Singleton bound      Singleton bound   In coding theory , the Singleton bound , named after Richard Collom Singleton, is a relatively crude bound on the size of an arbitrary block code    C   C   C   with block length   n   n   n   , size   M   M   M   and minimum distance   d   d   d   .  Statement of the bound  The minimum distance of a set   C   C   C   of codewords of length   n   n   n   is defined as      d  =     min   {    x  ,  y   ‚àà  C   :   x  ‚â†  y   }    d    (  x  ,  y  )        d      subscript    conditional-set     x  y   C     x  y     d    x  y      d=\min_{\{x,y\in C:x\neq y\}}d(x,y)   where    d   (  x  ,  y  )       d   x  y     d(x,y)   is the Hamming distance between   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   . The expression     A  q    (  n  ,  d  )        subscript  A  q    n  d     A_{q}(n,d)   represents the maximum number of possible codewords in a q-ary block code of length   n   n   n   and minimum distance   d   d   d   .  Then the Singleton bound states that         A  q    (  n  ,  d  )    ‚â§   q    n  -  d   +  1     .         subscript  A  q    n  d     superscript  q      n  d   1      A_{q}(n,d)\leq q^{n-d+1}.     Proof  First observe that the number of   q   q   q   -ary words of length   n   n   n   is    q  n     superscript  q  n    q^{n}   , since each letter in such a word may take one of   q   q   q   different values, independently of the remaining letters.  Now let   C   C   C   be an arbitrary q-ary block code of minimum distance   d   d   d   . Clearly, all codewords    c  ‚àà  C      c  C    c\in C   are distinct. If we puncture the code by deleting the first    d  -  1      d  1    d-1   letters of each codeword, then all resulting codewords must still be pairwise different, since all of the original codewords in   C   C   C   have Hamming distance at least   d   d   d   from each other. Thus the size of the altered code is the same as the original code.  The newly obtained codewords each have length       n  -   (   d  -  1   )    =    n  -  d   +  1         n    d  1        n  d   1     n-(d-1)=n-d+1   ,  and thus, there can be at most    q    n  -  d   +  1      superscript  q      n  d   1     q^{n-d+1}   of them. Since   C   C   C   was arbitrary, this bound must hold for the largest possible code with these parameters, thus: 1        |  C  |   ‚â§    A  q    (  n  ,  d  )    ‚â§   q    n  -  d   +  1     .          C      subscript  A  q    n  d          superscript  q      n  d   1       |C|\leq A_{q}(n,d)\leq q^{n-d+1}.     Linear codes  If   C   C   C   is a linear code with block length   n   n   n   , dimension   k   k   k   and minimum distance   d   d   d   over the finite field with   q   q   q   elements, then the maximum number of codewords is    q  k     superscript  q  k    q^{k}   and the Singleton bound implies:       q  k   ‚â§   q    n  -  d   +  1         superscript  q  k    superscript  q      n  d   1      q^{k}\leq q^{n-d+1}   , so that      k  ‚â§    n  -  d   +  1       k      n  d   1     k\leq n-d+1   , which is usually written as 2      d  ‚â§    n  -  k   +  1       d      n  k   1     d\leq n-k+1   .  In the linear code case a different proof of the Singleton bound can be obtained by observing that rank of the parity check matrix is    n  -  k      n  k    n-k   . 3  History  The usual citation given for this result is , but according to  the result can be found in a 1953 paper of Komamiya. 4  MDS codes  Linear block codes that achieve equality in the Singleton bound are called MDS (maximum distance separable) codes . Examples of such codes include codes that have only two codewords (the all-zero word and the all-one word, having thus minimum distance n), codes that use the whole of     (   ùîΩ  q   )   n     superscript   subscript  ùîΩ  q   n    (\mathbb{F}_{q})^{n}   (minimum distance 1), codes with a single parity symbol (minimum distance 2) and their dual codes . These are often called trivial MDS codes.  In the case of binary alphabets, only trivial MDS codes exist. 5 6  Examples of non-trivial MDS codes include Reed-Solomon codes and their extended versions. 7 8 In fact, it was proved by Simeon Ball that the only linear q -ary [ n , k , d ] MDS codes, for ''k  MDS codes are an important class of block codes since, for a fixed   n   n   n   and   k   k   k   , they have the greatest error correcting and detecting capabilities. There are several ways to characterize MDS codes: 9  Theorem : Let   C   C   C   be a linear [    n  ,  k  ,  d     n  k  d    n,k,d   ] code over    ùîΩ  q     subscript  ùîΩ  q    \mathbb{F}_{q}   . The following are equivalent:      C   C   C   is an MDS code.  Any   k   k   k   columns of a generator matrix for   C   C   C   are linearly independent .  Any    n  -  k      n  k    n-k   columns of a parity check matrix for   C   C   C   are linearly independent.      C  ‚üÇ     superscript  C  perpendicular-to    C^{\perp}   is an MDS code.  If    G  =   (  I  |  A  )      fragments  G    fragments  normal-(  I  normal-|  A  normal-)     G=(I|A)   is a generator matrix for   C   C   C   in standard form, then every square submatrix of   A   A   A   is nonsingular .  Given any   d   d   d   coordinate positions, there is a (minimum weight) codeword whose support is precisely these positions.   The last of these characterizations permits, by using the MacWilliams identities , an explicit formula for the complete weight distribution of an MDS code. 10  Theorem : Let   C   C   C   be a linear [    n  ,  k  ,  d     n  k  d    n,k,d   ] MDS code over    ùîΩ  q     subscript  ùîΩ  q    \mathbb{F}_{q}   . If    A  w     subscript  A  w    A_{w}   denotes the number of codewords in   C   C   C   of weight   w   w   w   , then        A  w   =    (     n      w     )     ‚àë   j  =  0    w  -  d       (   -  1   )   j    (     w      j     )    (    q     w  -  d   +  1   -  j    -  1   )      =    (     n      w     )    (   q  -  1   )     ‚àë   j  =  0    w  -  d       (   -  1   )   j    (      w  -  1       j     )    q   w  -  d  -  j        .         subscript  A  w      binomial  n  w     superscript   subscript     j  0      w  d       superscript    1   j    binomial  w  j      superscript  q        w  d   1   j    1              binomial  n  w     q  1     superscript   subscript     j  0      w  d       superscript    1   j    binomial    w  1   j    superscript  q    w  d  j          A_{w}={\left({{n}\atop{w}}\right)}\sum_{j=0}^{w-d}(-1)^{j}{\left({{w}\atop{j}}%

 {j}{\left({{w-1}\atop{j}}\right)}q^{w-d-j}.     Arcs in projective geometry  The linear independence of the columns of a generator matrix of an MDS code permits a construction of MDS codes from objects in finite  projective geometry . Let    P  G   (  N  ,  q  )       P  G   N  q     PG(N,q)   be the finite projective space of (geometric) dimension   N   N   N   over the finite field    ùîΩ  q     subscript  ùîΩ  q    \mathbb{F}_{q}   . Let    K  =   {   P  1   ,   P  2   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   P  m   }       K    subscript  P  1    subscript  P  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  P  m      K=\{P_{1},P_{2},\dots,P_{m}\}   be a set of points in this projective space represented with homogeneous coordinates . Form the     (   N  +  1   )   √ó  m        N  1   m    (N+1)\times m   matrix   G   G   G   whose columns are the homogeneous coordinates of these points. Then, 11  Theorem    K   K   K   is a (spacial) m -arc if and only if   G   G   G   is the generator matrix of an    [  m  ,   N  +  1   ,   m  -  N   ]     m    N  1     m  N     [m,N+1,m-N]   MDS code over    ùîΩ  q     subscript  ùîΩ  q    \mathbb{F}_{q}   .
