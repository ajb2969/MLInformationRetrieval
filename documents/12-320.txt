Matching distance

In mathematics, the matching distance12 is a metric on the space of size functions.

The core of the definition of matching distance is the observation that the information contained in a size function can be combinatorially stored in a formal series of lines and points of the plane, called respectively cornerlines and cornerpoints.
Given two size functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  (resp. 
 
 
 
 ) be the multiset of all cornerpoints and cornerlines for 
 
 
 
  (resp. 
 
 
 
 ) counted with their multiplicities, augmented by adding a countable infinity of points of the diagonal 
 
 
 
 .
The matching distance between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  varies among all the bijections between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and



Roughly speaking, the matching distance 
 
 
 
  between two size functions is the minimum, over all the matchings between the cornerpoints of the two size functions, of the maximum of the 
 
 
 
 -distances between two matched cornerpoints. Since two size functions can have a different number of cornerpoints, these can be also matched to points of the diagonal 
 
 
 
 . Moreover, the definition of 
 
 
 
  implies that matching two points of the diagonal has no cost.
