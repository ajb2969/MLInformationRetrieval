FK-space

In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics a FK-space or Fréchet coordinate space is a sequence space equipped with a topological structure such that it becomes a Fréchet space. FK-spaces with a normable topology are called BK-spaces.
There exists only one topology to turn a sequence space into a Fréchet space, namely the topology of pointwise convergence. Thus the name coordinate space because a sequence in an FK-space converges if and only if it converges for each coordinate.
FK-spaces are examples of topological vector spaces. They are important in summability theory.
Definition
A FK-space is a sequence space

 
 , that is a linear subspace of vector space of all complex valued sequences, equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence.
We write the elements of 
 
 
 
  as


 
  with 
 
 

Then sequence 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  converges to some point 
 
 
 
  if it converges pointwise for each 
 
 
 
 . That is


 
  if



Examples

The sequence space 
 
 
 
  of all complex valued sequences is trivially an FK-space.

Properties
Given an FK-space 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with the topology of pointwise convergence the inclusion map


 
  is continuous.
FK-space constructions
Given a countable family of FK-spaces 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  a countable family of semi-norms, we define


 
  and


 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 
  is again an FK-space.
