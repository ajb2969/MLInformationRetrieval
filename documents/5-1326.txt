   FK-space      FK-space   In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics a FK-space or Fréchet coordinate space is a sequence space equipped with a topological structure such that it becomes a Fréchet space . FK-spaces with a normable topology are called BK-spaces .  There exists only one topology to turn a sequence space into a Fréchet space , namely the topology of pointwise convergence . Thus the name coordinate space because a sequence in an FK-space converges if and only if it converges for each coordinate.  FK-spaces are examples of topological vector spaces . They are important in summability theory .  Definition  A FK-space is a sequence space    X   X   X   , that is a linear subspace of vector space of all complex valued sequences, equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence .  We write the elements of   X   X   X   as       (   x  n   )    n  ∈  ℕ      subscript   subscript  x  n     n  ℕ     (x_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}   with     x  n   ∈  ℂ       subscript  x  n   ℂ    x_{n}\in\mathbb{C}     Then sequence     (   a  n   )    n  ∈  ℕ    (  k  )      superscript   subscript   subscript  a  n     n  ℕ    k    (a_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}^{(k)}   in   X   X   X   converges to some point     (   x  n   )    n  ∈  ℕ      subscript   subscript  x  n     n  ℕ     (x_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}   if it converges pointwise for each   n   n   n   . That is        lim   k  →  ∞      (   a  n   )    n  ∈  ℕ    (  k  )     =    (   x  n   )    n  ∈  ℕ          subscript    normal-→  k      superscript   subscript   subscript  a  n     n  ℕ    k     subscript   subscript  x  n     n  ℕ      \lim_{k\to\infty}(a_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}^{(k)}=(x_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}   if        ∀  n   ∈  ℕ   :     lim   k  →  ∞     a  n   (  k  )     =   x  n       normal-:     for-all  n   ℕ       subscript    normal-→  k      superscript   subscript  a  n   k     subscript  x  n      \forall n\in\mathbb{N}:\lim_{k\to\infty}a_{n}^{(k)}=x_{n}     Examples   The sequence space   ω   ω   \omega   of all complex valued sequences is trivially an FK-space.   Properties  Given an FK-space   X   X   X   and   ω   ω   \omega   with the topology of pointwise convergence the inclusion map      ι  :   X  →  ω      normal-:  ι   normal-→  X  ω     \iota:X\to\omega   is continuous .  FK-space constructions  Given a countable family of FK-spaces    (   X  n   ,   P  n   )      subscript  X  n    subscript  P  n     (X_{n},P_{n})   with    P  n     subscript  P  n    P_{n}   a countable family of semi-norms , we define      X  :=    ⋂   n  =  1   ∞    X  n       assign  X    superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  X  n      X:=\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}X_{n}   and      P  :=   {   p   |  X    ∣   p  ∈   P  n    }      assign  P   conditional-set   subscript  p   fragments  normal-|  X      p   subscript  P  n       P:=\{p_{|X}\mid p\in P_{n}\}   . Then    (  X  ,  P  )     X  P    (X,P)   is again an FK-space.  See also   BK-space , FK-spaces with a normable topology   "  Category:Topological vector spaces
