Chazy equation

In mathematics, the Chazy equation is the differential equation


 
  It was introduced by  as an example of a third-order differential equation with a movable singularity that is a natural boundary for its solutions.
One solution is given by the Eisenstein series


 
  Acting on this solution by the group SL2 gives a 3-parameter family of solutions.
