   Chazy equation      Chazy equation   In mathematics , the Chazy equation is the differential equation          d  3   y    d   x  3     =    2  y     d  2   y    d   x  2      -   3    (    d  y    d  x    )   2      .           superscript  d  3   y     d   superscript  x  3         2  y       superscript  d  2   y     d   superscript  x  2        3   superscript      d  y     d  x    2       \frac{d^{3}y}{dx^{3}}=2y\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}-3\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{2}.   It was introduced by  as an example of a third-order differential equation with a movable singularity that is a natural boundary for its solutions.  One solution is given by the Eisenstein series         E  2    (  τ  )    =   1  -   24   ∑    σ  1    (  n  )    q  n       =   1  -   24  q   -   72   q  2    -  ⋯    .           subscript  E  2   τ     1    24       subscript  σ  1   n   superscript  q  n              1    24  q     72   superscript  q  2    normal-⋯      E_{2}(\tau)=1-24\sum\sigma_{1}(n)q^{n}=1-24q-72q^{2}-\cdots.   Acting on this solution by the group SL 2 gives a 3-parameter family of solutions.  References       "  Category:Ordinary differential equations
