   S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine deaminase      S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine deaminase   S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine deaminase (, MTA deaminase , 5-methylthioadenosine deaminase ) is an enzyme with system name S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine amidohydrolase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5'-S-methyl-5'-thioinosine + NH 3    The enzyme from Thermotoga maritima also functions as S-adenosylhomocysteine deaminase ( EC 3.5.4.28 ).
