   Kleinian integer      Kleinian integer   In mathematical cryptography , a Kleinian integer is a complex number of the form    m  +   n    1  +    -  7     2        m    n      1      7     2      m+n\frac{1+\sqrt{-7}}{2}   , with m and n  rational integers . They are named after Felix Klein .  The Kleinian integers form a ring called the Kleinian ring , which is the ring of integers in the imaginary quadratic field     ℚ   (   -  7   )       ℚ    7     \mathbb{Q}(-7)   . This ring is a unique factorization domain .  See also   Eisenstein integer  Gaussian integer   References    . ( Review ).    "  Category:Algebraic numbers
