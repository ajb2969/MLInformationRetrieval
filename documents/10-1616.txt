   Amino-acid racemase      Amino-acid racemase   In enzymology , an amino-acid racemase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an L-amino acid   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a D-amino acid   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , L- amino acid , and one product , D- amino acid .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on amino acids and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is amino-acid racemase . This enzyme is also called L-amino acid racemase . This enzyme participates in 4 metabolic pathways : glycine , serine and threonine metabolism, cysteine metabolism, D- glutamine and D- glutamate metabolism, and D- arginine and D- ornithine metabolism. It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
