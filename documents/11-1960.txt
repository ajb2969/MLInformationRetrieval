Matrix polynomial

In mathematics, a matrix polynomial is a polynomial with matrices as variables. Given an ordinary, scalar-valued polynomial


 
  this polynomial evaluated at a matrix A is


 
  where I is the identity matrix.
A matrix polynomial equation is an equality between two matrix polynomials, which holds for the specific matrices in question. A matrix polynomial identity is a matrix polynomial equation which holds for all matrices A in a specified matrix ring Mn(R).
Characteristic and minimal polynomial
The characteristic polynomial of a matrix A is a scalar-valued polynomial, defined by 
 
 
 
 . The Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that if this polynomial is viewed as a matrix polynomial and evaluated at the matrix A itself, the result is the zero matrix
 
 
 
 . The characteristic polynomial is thus a polynomial which annihilates A.
There is a unique monic polynomial of minimal degree which annihilates A; this polynomial is the minimal polynomial. Any polynomial which annihilates A (such as the characteristic polynomial) is a multiple of the minimal polynomial.
It follows that that given two polynomials P and Q, we have 
 
 
 
  if and only if


 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes the jth derivative of P and 
 
 
 
  are the eigenvalues of A with corresponding indices 
 
 
 
  (the index of an eigenvalue is the size of its largest Jordan block).
Matrix geometrical series
Matrix polynomials can be used to sum a matrix geometrical series as one would an ordinary geometric series,












If I − A is nonsingular one can evaluate the expression for the sum S.
