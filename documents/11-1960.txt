   Matrix polynomial      Matrix polynomial   In mathematics, a matrix polynomial is a polynomial with matrices as variables. Given an ordinary, scalar-valued polynomial        P   (  x  )    =    ∑   i  =  0   n     a  i    x  i     =    a  0   +    a  1   x   +    a  2    x  2    +  ⋯  +    a  n    x  n      ,          P  x     superscript   subscript     i  0    n      subscript  a  i    superscript  x  i             subscript  a  0      subscript  a  1   x      subscript  a  2    superscript  x  2    normal-⋯     subscript  a  n    superscript  x  n        P(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}{a_{i}x^{i}}=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}x^{n},   this polynomial evaluated at a matrix A is        P   (  A  )    =    ∑   i  =  0   n     a  i    A  i     =     a  0   I   +    a  1   A   +    a  2    A  2    +  ⋯  +    a  n    A  n      ,          P  A     superscript   subscript     i  0    n      subscript  a  i    superscript  A  i               subscript  a  0   I      subscript  a  1   A      subscript  a  2    superscript  A  2    normal-⋯     subscript  a  n    superscript  A  n        P(A)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}{a_{i}A^{i}}=a_{0}I+a_{1}A+a_{2}A^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}A^{n},   where I is the identity matrix .  A matrix polynomial equation is an equality between two matrix polynomials, which holds for the specific matrices in question. A matrix polynomial identity is a matrix polynomial equation which holds for all matrices A in a specified matrix ring  M n ( R ).  Characteristic and minimal polynomial  The characteristic polynomial of a matrix A is a scalar-valued polynomial, defined by      p  A    (  t  )    =   det   (    t  I   -  A   )           subscript  p  A   t         t  I   A      p_{A}(t)=\det\left(tI-A\right)   . The Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that if this polynomial is viewed as a matrix polynomial and evaluated at the matrix A itself, the result is the zero matrix      p  A    (  A  )    =  0         subscript  p  A   A   0    p_{A}(A)=0   . The characteristic polynomial is thus a polynomial which annihilates A .  There is a unique monic polynomial of minimal degree which annihilates A ; this polynomial is the minimal polynomial . Any polynomial which annihilates A (such as the characteristic polynomial) is a multiple of the minimal polynomial.  It follows that that given two polynomials P and Q , we have     P   (  A  )    =   Q   (  A  )          P  A     Q  A     P(A)=Q(A)   if and only if          P   (  j  )     (   λ  i   )    =    Q   (  j  )     (   λ  i   )        for  j   =   0  ,  …    ,     n  i   and  i   =   1  ,  …  ,  s      ,     formulae-sequence       superscript  P  j    subscript  λ  i       superscript  Q  j    subscript  λ  i      formulae-sequence      for  j    0  normal-…         subscript  n  i   and  i    1  normal-…  s       P^{(j)}(\lambda_{i})=Q^{(j)}(\lambda_{i})\qquad\text{for }j=0,\ldots,n_{i}%
 \text{ and }i=1,\ldots,s,   where    P   (  j  )      superscript  P  j    P^{(j)}   denotes the j th derivative of P and     λ  1   ,  …  ,   λ  s       subscript  λ  1   normal-…   subscript  λ  s     \lambda_{1},\dots,\lambda_{s}   are the eigenvalues of A with corresponding indices     n  1   ,  …  ,   n  s       subscript  n  1   normal-…   subscript  n  s     n_{1},\dots,n_{s}   (the index of an eigenvalue is the size of its largest Jordan block ).  Matrix geometrical series  Matrix polynomials can be used to sum a matrix geometrical series as one would an ordinary geometric series ,      S  =   I  +  A  +   A  2   +  ⋯  +   A  n        S    I  A   superscript  A  2   normal-⋯   superscript  A  n      S=I+A+A^{2}+\cdots+A^{n}          A  S   =   A  +   A  2   +   A  3   +  ⋯  +   A   n  +  1           A  S     A   superscript  A  2    superscript  A  3   normal-⋯   superscript  A    n  1       AS=A+A^{2}+A^{3}+\cdots+A^{n+1}           (   I  -  A   )   S   =   S  -   A  S    =   I  -   A   n  +  1               I  A   S     S    A  S           I   superscript  A    n  1        (I-A)S=S-AS=I-A^{n+1}         S  =     (   I  -  A   )    -  1     (   I  -   A   n  +  1     )        S     superscript    I  A     1      I   superscript  A    n  1        S=(I-A)^{-1}(I-A^{n+1})     If I − A is nonsingular one can evaluate the expression for the sum S .
