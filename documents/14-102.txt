   HO (complexity)      HO (complexity)   High-order logic is an extension of first-order and second-order with high order quantifiers. In descriptive complexity we can see that it is equal to the ELEMENTARY functions. 1 There is a relation between the   i   i   i   th order and non determinist algorithm the time of which is with    i  -  1      i  1    i-1   level of exponentials.  Definitions and notations  We define high-order variable, a variable of order    i  >  1      i  1    i>1   has got an arity   k   k   k   and represent any set of   k   k   k   - tuples of elements of order    i  -  1      i  1    i-1   . They are usually written in upper-case and with a natural number as exponent to indicate the order. High order logic is the set of FO formulae where we add quantification over higher-order variables, hence we will use the terms defined in the FO article without defining them again.  HO     i     i    {}^{i}   is the set of formulae where variable's order are at most   i   i   i   . HO     j     i     subscript   superscript  absent  i   j    {}^{i}_{j}   is the subset of the formulae of the form    ϕ  =   ∃     X  1  i   ¯    ∀     X  2  i   ¯   …  Q    X  j  i   ¯   ψ          ϕ       normal-¯   subscript   superscript  X  i   1     for-all     normal-¯   superscript   subscript  X  2   i    normal-…  Q   normal-¯   superscript   subscript  X  j   i    ψ        \phi=\exists\overline{X^{i}_{1}}\forall\overline{X_{2}^{i}}\dots Q\overline{X_%
 {j}^{i}}\psi   where   Q   Q   Q   is a quantifier,    Q    X  i   ¯       Q   normal-¯   superscript  X  i      Q\overline{X^{i}}   means that     X  i   ¯     normal-¯   superscript  X  i     \overline{X^{i}}   is a tuple of variable of order   i   i   i   with the same quantification. So it is the set of formulae with   j   j   j   alternations of quantifiers of   i   i   i   th order, beginning by and   ∃     \exists   , followed by a formula of order    i  -  1      i  1    i-1   .  Using the tetration 's standard notation,      exp  2  0    (  x  )    =  x        superscript   subscript   2   0   x   x    \exp_{2}^{0}(x)=x   and      exp  2   i  +  1     (  x  )    =   2    exp  2  i    (  x  )           superscript   subscript   2     i  1    x    superscript  2    superscript   subscript   2   i   x      \exp_{2}^{i+1}(x)=2^{\exp_{2}^{i}(x)}   .      exp  2   i  +  1     (  x  )    =   2   2   2   2   …   2  x              superscript   subscript   2     i  1    x    superscript  2   superscript  2   superscript  2   superscript  2   superscript  normal-…   superscript  2  x          \exp_{2}^{i+1}(x)=2^{2^{2^{2^{\dots^{2^{x}}}}}}   with   i   i   i   times   2   2   2     Property  Normal form  Every formula of   i   i   i   th order is equivalent to a formula in prenex normal form, where we first write quantification over variable of   i   i   i   th order and then a formula of order    i  -  1      i  1    i-1   in normal form.  Relation to complexity classes  HO is equal to ELEMENTARY functions. To be more precise,     HO  0  i   =   NTIME   (    exp  2   i  -  2     (   n   O   (  1  )     )    )         subscript   superscript  HO  i   0     NTIME    superscript   subscript   2     i  2     superscript  n    O  1        \text{HO}^{i}_{0}=\text{NTIME}(\exp_{2}^{i-2}(n^{O(1)}))   , it means a tower of    (   i  -  2   )      i  2    (i-2)   2s, ending with    n  c     superscript  n  c    n^{c}   where   c   c   c   is a constant. A special case of it is that    ∃   S  O         S  O     \exists{}SO   =HO     0     2     subscript   superscript  absent  2   0    {}^{2}_{0}   =NTIME(    n   O   (  1  )       superscript  n    O  1     n^{O(1)}   )= NP , which is exactly the Fagin's theorem . Using oracle machines in the polynomial hierarchy , HO     j     i     subscript   superscript  absent  i   j    {}^{i}_{j}   = NTIME (     exp  2   i  -  2      (   n   O   (  1  )     )    Σ  j  P       fragments   superscript   subscript   2     i  2     superscript   fragments  normal-(   superscript  n    O  1    normal-)    superscript   subscript  normal-Σ  j   normal-P      \exp_{2}^{i-2}(n^{O(1)})^{\Sigma_{j}^{\rm P}}   )  References  External links   zoo about HO .
