L-lysine 6-transaminase

In enzymology, a L-lysine 6-transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-lysine + 2-oxoglutarate 
 
 
 
  2-aminoadipate 6-semialdehyde + L-glutamate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-lysine and 2-oxoglutarate, whereas its two products are 2-aminoadipate 6-semialdehyde and L-glutamate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-lysine:2-oxoglutarate 6-aminotransferase. Other names in common use include lysine 6-aminotransferase, lysine epsilon-aminotransferase, lysine epsilon-transaminase, lysine:2-ketoglutarate 6-aminotransferase, L-lysine-alpha-ketoglutarate aminotransferase, and L-lysine-alpha-ketoglutarate 6-aminotransferase. This enzyme participates in lysine biosynthesis. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
