   Phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase      Phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase   In enzymology , a phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 6-(N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol , whereas its two products are UDP and 6-(N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , to be specific the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 6-(N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl)transferase . Other names in common use include UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:phosphatidylinositol , N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyltransferase , uridine diphosphoacetylglucosamine , and alpha1,6-acetyl-D-glucosaminyltransferase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : glycosylphosphatidylinositol(gpi)-anchor , ???, and glycan structures - biosynthesis 2 .
