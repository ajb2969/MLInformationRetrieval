TRNA-intron endonuclease

tRNA-intron lyase (, tRNA intron endonuclease, transfer ribonucleate intron endoribonuclease, tRNA splicing endonuclease, splicing endonuclease, tRNATRPintron endonuclease, transfer splicing endonuclease) is an enzyme.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

pre-tRNA 
 
 
 
  a 3'-half-tRNA molecule with a 5'-OH end + a 5'-half-tRNA molecule with a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate end + an intron with a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and a 5'-hydroxyl terminus
 

This enzyme catalyses the final stage in the maturation of tRNA molecules. Its systematic name is pretRNA lyase (intron-removing; cyclic-2',3'-phosphate-forming).
