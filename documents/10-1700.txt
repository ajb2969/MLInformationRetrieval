Retinol isomerase




Retinol isomerase

In enzymology, a retinol isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

all-trans-retinol 
 
 
 
  11-cis-retinol
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, all-trans-retinol, and one product, 11-cis-retinol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically cis-trans isomerases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is all-trans-retinol 11-cis-trans-isomerase. This enzyme is also called all-trans-retinol isomerase. This enzyme participates in retinol metabolism.
