Pseudo-zero set

In complex analysis, the pseudo-zero set or root neighborhood of a degree-m polynomial p(z) is the set of all complex numbers that are roots of polynomials whose coefficients differ from p's by a small amount. Namely, given a norm |·| on 
 
 
 
 , the pseudo-zero set is the set of all zeros of degree-m polynomials q such that |p-q| (as vectors) is less than a given ε.
