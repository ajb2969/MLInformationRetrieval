Definition
Matthew K. Franklin and Gene Tsudik suggested in 19982 the following classification:

An 
 
 
 
 -party single-unit general exchange is a permutation

 
  on 
 
 
 
 , where each party 
 
 
 
  offers a single unit of commodity 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , and receives a single unit of commodity 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
 .


An 
 
 
 
 -party multi-unit general exchange is a matrix of baskets, where the entry 
 
 
 
  in row 
 
 
 
  and column 
 
 
 
  is the basket of goods given by 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .
