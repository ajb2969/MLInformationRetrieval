   Multi-party fair exchange protocol      Multi-party fair exchange protocol   In cryptography , a multi-party fair exchange protocol is protocol where parties accept to deliver an item if and only if they receive an item in return. 1  Definition  Matthew K. Franklin and Gene Tsudik suggested in 1998 2 the following classification:   An   n   n   n   -party single-unit general exchange is a permutation    σ   σ   \sigma   on    {   1...  n   }       1...  n     \{1...n\}   , where each party    P  i     subscript  P  i    P_{i}   offers a single unit of commodity    K  i     subscript  K  i    K_{i}   to    P   σ   (  i  )       subscript  P    σ  i     P_{\sigma(i)}   , and receives a single unit of commodity    K    σ   -  1     (  i  )       subscript  K     superscript  σ    1    i     K_{\sigma^{-1}(i)}   from    P    σ   -  1     (  i  )       subscript  P     superscript  σ    1    i     P_{\sigma^{-1}(i)}   .    An   n   n   n   -party multi-unit general exchange is a matrix of baskets, where the entry    B   i  j      subscript  B    i  j     B_{ij}   in row   i   i   i   and column   j   j   j   is the basket of goods given by    P  i     subscript  P  i    P_{i}   to    P  j     subscript  P  j    P_{j}   .
