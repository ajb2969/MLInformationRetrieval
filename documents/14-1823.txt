   Thyroid's secretory capacity      Thyroid's secretory capacity   Thyroid's secretory capacity (GT, also referred to as thyroid's incretory capacity, maximum thyroid hormone output, T4 output or, if calculated from levels of thyroid hormones, as SPINA-GT) is the maximum stimulated amount of thyroxine that the thyroid can produce in a given time-unit (e.g. one second). 1  How to determine GT  Experimentally, GT can be determined by stimulating the thyroid with high a thyrotropin concentration and measuring its output in terms of T4 production.  In vivo , GT can also be estimated from equilibrium levels of TSH and T4 or free T4. In this case it is calculated with        G  ^   T   =     β  T    (    D  T   +   [   T  S  H   ]    )    (   1  +    K  41    [   T  B  G   ]    +    K  42    [   T  B  P  A   ]     )    [   F   T  4    ]      α  T    [   T  S  H   ]          subscript   normal-^  G   T        subscript  β  T      subscript  D  T    delimited-[]    T  S  H       1     subscript  K  41    delimited-[]    T  B  G        subscript  K  42    delimited-[]    T  B  P  A       delimited-[]    F   subscript  T  4         subscript  α  T    delimited-[]    T  S  H        \hat{G}_{T}={{\beta_{T}(D_{T}+[TSH])(1+K_{41}[TBG]+K_{42}[TBPA])[FT_{4}]}\over%
