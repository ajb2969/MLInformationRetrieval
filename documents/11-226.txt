Methylthioribulose 1-phosphate dehydratase

In enzymology, a methylthioribulose 1-phosphate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-methyl-5-thio-D-ribulose 1-phosphate 
 
 
 
  5-(methylthio)-2,3-dioxopentyl phosphate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, S-methyl-5-thio-D-ribulose 1-phosphate, and two products, 5-(methylthio)-2,3-dioxopentyl phosphate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-methyl-5-thio-D-ribulose-1-phosphate 4-hydro-lyase [5-(methylthio)-2,3-dioxopentyl-phosphate-forming]. Other names in common use include 1-PMT-ribulose dehydratase, and S-methyl-5-thio-D-ribulose-1-phosphate hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in methionine metabolism.
