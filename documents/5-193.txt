Check mark

A check mark, checkmark or tick is a mark (, , , etc.) used to indicate the concept "yes" (e.g. "yes; this has been verified", "yes; that is the correct answer", "yes; this has been completed", or "yes; this [item or option] applies to me"). The x mark is also sometimes used for this purpose (most notably on election ballot papers), but otherwise usually indicates "no", incorrectness, or failure.
As a verb, to check (off) or tick (off), means to add such a mark. Printed forms, printed documents, and computer software (see Checkbox), commonly include squares in which to place check marks.
International differences
The check mark is a predominant affirmative symbol of convenience in the English-speaking world because of its instant and facile composition. In other countries, however, the mark is more complicated. For example, in French,  is used to indicate an incorrect answer, while a "B" bon is used to indicate a correct answer.
It is common in Swedish schools for a  to indicate that an answer is incorrect (while "R", from the Swedish rätt, i.e., "correct", is used to indicate that an answer is correct).
In Finnish,  stands for väärin, i.e., "wrong", due to its similarity to a slanted v. (The opposite, "right", is marked with 
 
 
 
 , a slanted vertical line emphasized with two dots).
