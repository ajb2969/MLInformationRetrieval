   1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase      1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   propane-1,3-diol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-hydroxypropanal + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are propane-1,3-diol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 3-hydroxypropanal , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is propane-1,3-diol:NAD + 1-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde reductase , 1,3-PD:NAD + oxidoreductase , 1,3-propanediol:NAD + oxidoreductase , and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in ether lipid metabolism as a step in glycerolipid biosynthesis.
