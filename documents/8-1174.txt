N-jet

An N-jet is the set of (partial) derivatives of a function 
 
 
 
  up to order 
 
 
1.
Specifically, in the area of computer vision, the N-jet is usually computed from a scale space representation 
 
 
 
  of the input image 
 
 
 
 , and the partial derivatives of 
 
 
 
  are used as a basis for expressing various types of visual modules. For example, algorithms for tasks such as feature detection, feature classification, stereo matching, tracking and object recognition can be expressed in terms of N-jets computed at one or several scales in scale space.
