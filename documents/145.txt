   Therapeutic index      Therapeutic index   The therapeutic index (TI) (also referred to as therapeutic window or safety window or sometimes as therapeutic ratio ) is a comparison of the amount of a therapeutic agent that causes the therapeutic effect to the amount that causes toxicity. 1  Classically, in an established clinical indication setting of an approved drug, TI refers to the ratio of the dose of drug that causes adverse effects at an incidence/severity not compatible with the targeted indication (e.g. toxic dose in 50% of subjects, TD50) divided by the dose that leads to the desired pharmacological effect (e.g. efficacious dose in 50% of subjects, ED50). In contrast, in a drug development setting TI is calculated based on plasma exposure levels. 2  In the early days of pharmaceutical toxicology, TI was frequently determined in animals as lethal dose of a drug for 50% of the population ( LD 50 ) divided by the minimum effective dose for 50% of the population ( ED 50 ). Today, more sophisticated toxicity endpoints are used.      Therapeutic ratio  =    LD  50    ED  50        Therapeutic ratio     subscript  LD  50    subscript  ED  50      \mbox{Therapeutic ratio}=\frac{\mathrm{LD}_{50}}{\mathrm{ED}_{50}}   in animal studies, or for humans,    Therapeutic ratio  =    TD  50    ED  50        Therapeutic ratio     subscript  TD  50    subscript  ED  50      \mbox{Therapeutic ratio}=\frac{\mathrm{TD}_{50}}{\mathrm{ED}_{50}}     For many drugs, there are severe toxicities that occur at sublethal doses in humans, and these toxicities often limit the maximum dose of a drug. A higher therapeutic index is preferable to a lower one: a patient would have to take a much higher dose of such a drug to reach the toxic threshold than the dose taken to elicit the therapeutic effect.  Generally, a drug or other therapeutic agent with a narrow therapeutic range (i.e. having little difference between toxic and therapeutic doses) may have its dosage adjusted according to measurements of the actual blood levels achieved in the person taking it. This may be achieved through therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) protocols.

At early discovery / development stage, the clinical TI of a drug candidate is not known. However, understanding the preliminary TI of a drug candidate is of utmost importance as early as possible since TI is an important indicator of the probability of the successful development of a drug. Recognizing drug candidates with potentially suboptimal TI at earliest possible stage helps to initiate mitigation or potentially re-deploy resources.  In a drug development setting, TI is the quantitative relationship between efficacy (pharmacology) and safety (toxicology), without considering the nature of pharmacological or toxicological endpoints themselves. However, in order to convert a calculated TI to something that is more than just a number, the nature and limitations of pharmacological and/or toxicological endpoints must be considered. Depending on the intended clinical indication, the associated unmet medical need and/or the competitive situation, more or less weight can be given to either the safety or efficacy of a drug candidate with the aim to create a well balanced indication-specific safety vs efficacy profile.  In general, it is the exposure of a given tissue to drug (i.e. drug concentration over time), rather than dose, that drives the pharmacological and toxicological effects. For example, at the same dose there may be marked inter-individual variability in exposure due to polymorphisms in metabolism, DDIs or differences body weight or environmental factors. These considerations emphasize the importance of using exposure rather than dose for calculating TI. In order to account for delays between exposure and toxicity, the TI for toxicities that occur after multiple dose administrations should be calculated using the exposure to drug at steady state rather than after administration of a single dose.  A review published by Muller and Milton in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery critically discusses the various aspects of TI determination and interpretation in a translational drug development setting for both small molecules and biotherapeutics. 3  Variation of Therapeutic Index  The therapeutic index varies widely among substances: most forgiving among the opioid analgesics is remifentanyl , which offers a therapeutic index of 33,000:1; tetrahydrocannabinol , a sedative and analgesic of herbal origin ( cannabis ), has a safe therapeutic index of 1000:1, while diazepam , a benzodiazepine  sedative-hypnotic and skeletal muscle relaxant has a less-forgiving index of 100:1 and morphine , a sedative , antidepressant , and analgesic also of herbal origin (genus Papaver ) has an index of 70:1 4 (which, however, is still considered very safe).  Less safe are cocaine , a stimulant and local anaesthetic , and ethanol (colloquially, the "alcohol" in alcoholic beverages ), a widely available sedative consumed world-wide – the therapeutic indices for these substances are 15:1 and 10:1, respectively. 5 Even less-safe are drugs such as digoxin , a cardiac glycoside ; its therapeutic index is approximately 2:1. 6 Other examples of drugs with a narrow therapeutic range, which may require drug monitoring both to achieve therapeutic levels and to minimize toxicity, include: paracetamol (acetaminophen) , dimercaprol , theophylline , warfarin and lithium carbonate . Some antibiotics require monitoring to balance efficacy with minimizing adverse effects , including: gentamicin , vancomycin , amphotericin B (nicknamed 'amphoterrible' for this very reason), and polymyxin B .  The effective therapeutic index can be affected by targeting , in which the therapeutic agent is concentrated in its area of effect. For example, in radiation therapy for cancerous tumors, shaping the radiation beam precisely to the profile of a tumor in the "beam's eye view" can increase the delivered dose without increasing toxic effects, though such shaping might not change the therapeutic index. Similarly, chemotherapy or radiotherapy with infused or injected agents can be made more efficacious by attaching the agent to an oncophilic substance, as is done in peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors and in chemoembolization or radioactive microspheres therapy for liver tumors and metastases. This concentrates the agent in the targeted tissues and lowers its concentration in others, increasing efficacy and lowering toxicity.  The Safety Ratio  Sometimes the term safety ratio is used instead, particularly when referring to psychoactive drugs used for non-therapeutic purposes, e.g. recreational use. 7 In such cases, the effective dose is the amount and frequency that produces the desired effect, which can vary, and can be greater or less than the therapeutically effective dose.  Synergistic effects  A therapeutic index does not consider drug interactions or synergistic effects. For example, the risk associated with benzodiazepines increases significantly when taken with alcohol, opiates, or stimulants when compared with being taken alone. Therapeutic index also does not take into account the ease or difficulty of reaching a toxic or lethal dose. This is more of a consideration for recreational drug users, as the purity can be highly variable.  Protective Index  Protective index is a similar concept, except that it uses TD 50 (median toxic dose) in place of LD 50 . For many substances, toxic effects can occur at levels far below those needed to cause death, and thus the protective index (if toxicity is properly specified) is often more informative about a substance's relative safety. Nevertheless, the therapeutic index is still useful as it can be considered an upper bound for the protective index, and the former also has the advantages of objectivity and easier comprehension.
