   3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate 2,3-dioxygenase      3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate 2,3-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate 2,3-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-hydroxy-5-carboxymethylmuconate semialdehyde   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate and O 2 , whereas its product is 2-hydroxy-5-carboxymethylmuconate semialdehyde .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate:oxygen 2,3-oxidoreductase (decyclizing) . Other names in common use include 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid 2,3-dioxygenase , HPC dioxygenase , and homoprotocatechuate 2,3-dioxygenase . This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism . It employs one cofactor , iron .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 8 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , and .
