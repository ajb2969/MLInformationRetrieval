<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

<p>Born in <a class="uri" href="Odessa" title="wikilink">Odessa</a>, the Jabotinsky family made <em><a class="uri" href="aliyah" title="wikilink">aliyah</a></em> to <a href="Mandatory_Palestine" title="wikilink">Mandatory Palestine</a> in 1919. Following the arrest of his father the following year, he left the country and moved to <a class="uri" href="France" title="wikilink">France</a>, where he attended high school in <a class="uri" href="Paris" title="wikilink">Paris</a>, and later earned a degree in electrical engineering. Between 1933 and 1935 he worked as an engineer in an aircraft factory. In 1935 he returned to Palestine, and worked as an engineer at the <a class="uri" href="Naharayim" title="wikilink">Naharayim</a> power station in the <a href="Jordan_Valley_(Middle_East)" title="wikilink">Jordan Valley</a>.</p>

<p>A long-term member of Revisionism's <a class="uri" href="Betar" title="wikilink">Betar</a> youth movement, he became one of its representative leaders in 1936, and joined its worldwide board two years later. With Betar and the party's military wing, <a class="uri" href="Irgun" title="wikilink">Irgun</a>, he helped coordinate <a href="Aliyah_Bet" title="wikilink">illegal Jewish immigration</a> into Palestine; he was temporarily arrested by the British authorities in 1940, and upon his release he moved to the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, where his father died suddenly about the same time. There, together with <a href="Hillel_Kook" title="wikilink">Hillel Kook</a>'s 'Bergson Boys', <a href="Aryeh_Ben-Eliezer" title="wikilink">Aryeh Ben-Eliezer</a>, <a href="Shmuel_Merlin" title="wikilink">Shmuel Merlin</a> and <a href="Yitzhak_Ben-Ami" title="wikilink">Yitzhak Ben-Ami</a>, they founded the Emergency Committee to Save European Jewry,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> among others. He briefly returned to Palestine, but was again arrested by the British and expelled for illegal activities in 1944.</p>

<p>Following <a href="Declaration_of_Independence_(Israel)" title="wikilink">Israel's independence</a>, he returned in 1948, and was elected to the <a href="Israeli_legislative_election,_1949" title="wikilink">first Knesset</a> the following year, as a member of the <a class="uri" href="Herut" title="wikilink">Herut</a> party's list of candidates. On 20 February 1951 however, Jabotinsky and Hillel Kook left Herut, and sat as independents for the rest of the term, although the move was not recognised by the house committee;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> this followed on-going disagreements over the party’s direction and its new leadership by <a href="Menachem_Begin" title="wikilink">Menachem Begin</a>.</p>

<p>After leaving the Knesset, he was awarded a PhD in mathematics in 1957 from the <a href="Hebrew_University_of_Jerusalem" title="wikilink">Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a>. He also lectured on electricity theory at the <a href="Technion_–_Israel_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Technion</a> between 1955 and his death in 1969.</p>
