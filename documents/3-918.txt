   Codex Bezae      Codex Bezae   | type = Western text-type | cat = IV | hand = | note = }} The Codex Bezae Cantabrigensis , designated by siglum  D ea or 05 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), δ 5 ( von Soden ), is a codex of the New Testament dating from the 5th century written in an uncial hand on vellum . It contains, in both Greek and Latin , most of the four Gospels and Acts , with a small fragment of 3 John . Written one column per page, the codex contains 406 extant parchment leaves (from perhaps an original 534) measuring 26 x 21.5 cm, with the Greek text on the left face and the Latin text on the right. 1 A digital facsimile of the codex 2 is available from Cambridge University Library , which holds the manuscript.  Description  The first three lines of each book are in red letters, and black and red ink alternate the title of books. As many as eleven people (G, A, C, B, D, E, H, F, J 1 , L, K) have corrected the manuscript between the sixth and twelfth centuries. 3 The text is written colometrically and is full of hiatus . The Greek text of the codex has some copying errors, e.g., errors of metathesis: in John 1:3, ΕΓΕΝΕΤΟ was changed into ΕΝΕΓΕΤΟ; in Acts 1:9, ΥΠΕΛΑΒΕΝ into ΥΠΕΒΑΛΕΝ.  Some from the nomina sacra are written in an abbreviated form: ΙΗΣ (Ιησους), ΧΡΣ (Χριστος), ΠΑΡ (πατηρ), ΣΤΗ (σταυρωθη), but not for μητερ, υιος, σωτηρ, ανθρωπος, ουρανος, δαυιδ, Ισραηλ, Ιηρουσαλημ, which are written fully. 4  History  The place of origin of the codex is still disputed; both France and southern Italy have been suggested. 5 6  The manuscript is believed to have been repaired at Lyon in the ninth century, as revealed by a distinctive ink used for supplementary pages. It was closely guarded for many centuries in the monastic library of St Irenaeus at Lyon. The manuscript was consulted, perhaps in Italy, for disputed readings at the Council of Trent , and was at about the same time collated for Stephanus's edition of the Greek New Testament. During the upheavals of the Wars of Religion in the 16th century, when textual analysis had a new urgency among the Reformation 's Protestants, the manuscript was taken from Lyon in 1562 and delivered to the Protestant scholar Theodore Beza , the friend and successor of Calvin, who gave it to the University of Cambridge , in the comparative security of England, in 1581, which accounts for its double name. It remains in the Cambridge University Library (Nn. II 41). 7 8  John Mill collated and Wettstein transcribed (1716) the text of the codex. Both did their editions of the Greek Testament, but they both did their work carelessly. A much better collation was made about 1732 by John Dickinson.  Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener edited the text of the codex in 1864 (rewritten text of the codex) 9 and in 1899 (photographic facsimile).  The importance of the Codex Bezae is such that a colloquium held at Lunel, Herault, in 27–30 June 1994 was entirely devoted to it. 10 Papers discussed the many questions it poses to our understanding of the use of the Gospels and Acts in early Christianity, and of the text of the New Testament.  Codex contents  The manuscript presents the gospels in the Western order Matthew , John , Luke and Mark , of which only Luke is complete; after some missing pages the manuscript picks up with the Third Epistle of John (in Latin) and contains part of Acts .   Lacunae:  Matthew 1:1-20, 6:20-9:2, 27:2-12; John 1:16-3:26; Acts 8:29-10:14, 21:2-10, 21:16-18, 22:10-20, 22:29-End    Omitted verses:  Matthew ; ; ; ; ; ;  Mark  Luke ; ; ; ; ; ;  John    Supplementations (by a later hand):  Matthew 3:7-16; Mark 16:15-20; John 18:14-20:13   Text type  The Greek text is unique, with many interpolations found "everywhere" else, with a few remarkable omissions, and a capricious tendency to rephrase sentences. Aside from this one Greek manuscript it is found in Old Latin (pre- Vulgate ) versions — as seen in the Latin here — and in Syriac, and Armenian versions. Bezae is the principal Greek representative 11 of the Western text-type . The manuscript demonstrates the latitude in the manuscript tradition that could still be found in the 5th and 6th centuries, the date of this codex.  There is no consensus on the many problems the Greek text presents. Since the Latin, however, occasionally agrees with Codices Codex Bobiensis and Codex Veronensis , it is a witness to a text current no later than 250 CE and "preserves an ancient form of the Old Latin text." 12 Issues of conformity have dogged the usage of the Codex Bezae in biblical scholarship. In general the Greek text is treated as an unreliable witness and treated as "an important corroborating witness wherever it agrees with other early manuscripts" as one of the links below freely admits.  Some of the outstanding features: Matthew 16:2b–3 is present and not marked as doubtful or spurious. One of the longer endings of Mark is given. Luke 22:43f and Pericope de adultera are present and not marked as spurious or doubtful. John 5:4 is omitted, and the text of Acts is nearly one-tenth longer than the generally received text.  Notable readings  (Figure)  John 3:26-4:1 (Greek text)   Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis contains some extraordinary readings. 13 Below is a comprehensive enumeration of those readings, with text and translation.

When you enter into a house and are summoned to dine, do not sit down at the prominent places, lest perchance a man more honorable than you come in afterwards, and he who invited you come and say to you, "Go down lower"; and you shall be ashamed. But if you sit down in the inferior place, and one inferior to you come in, then he that invited you will say to you, "Go up higher"; and this will be advantageous for you. 15   In syr c the passage reads slightly different, perhaps making more intelligible sense. The Syriac reflects the following Greek text. Literal translation:   ὑμεῖς δὲ ζητεῖτε ἐκ μικροῦ αὐξήσαι καὶ μὴ ἐκ μείζονος ἔλαττον εἶναι εἰσερχόμενοι δὲ καὶ παρακληθέντες δειπνῆσαι μὴ ἀνὰκλινεσθε εἷς τοὺς ἐξἔχοντας τόπους μήποτε ἐνδοξότερον σου ἐπέλθῃ καὶ προσελθὼν ὁ δειπνοκλήτωρ εἴπῃ σοι ἔτι κάτω χὼρει καὶ καταισχυνθήσῃ ἐὰν δὲ αναπεσής εἷς τόν ἥττονα τόπον καὶ ἐπέλθῃ σου ἥσσων ἐρεῖ σοι ὁ δειπνοκλήτωρ σύναγε ἔτι ἄνω καὶ ἔσται σοι τοῦτο χρήσιμον    But seek ye to increase from the least, and not from the greater to become the lesser. Also, when ye enter and are invited to dine, do not recline in one of the distinguished places, lest one more honorable than you might come and, upon approaching the dinner host, you should be told, "Move further down," and you will be humiliated. But if you recline in the inferior place, and one lesser than you should come, the dinner host will tell you, "Come, be joined in yet higher," and this will be of benefit to you.   omits text Κύριε ( Lord ) with א Θ f 13 118 157 209 346 565 700 it a,b,c,d,e,ff 1 ,ff 2 ,h,n  syr c,pal ms mae-1 Codex Schøyen   τὸ ἱερὸν τοῦ θεοῦ ( the temple of God ) C D W X Δ Σ Φ f 1 22 69 124 174 346 983 Byz lat syr geo mss Basil  τὸ ἱερὸν ( the temple ) א B L Θ 0281 vid  f 13 , most minuscule mss., it b syr pal co Codex Schøyen arm geo mss aeth   is omitted, as in $\mathfrak{P}$ 104 33 it a,b,d,e,ff 1 ,ff 2 ,r 1 syr s  Irenaeus lat  Origen  Eusebius   Ἄρατε αὐτόν ποδῶν καὶ χειρῶν καὶ Βάλετε αὐτόν εἰς τὸ σκότος τὸ ἐξώτερον ( Take pl him [by] his feet and his hands and cast pl him into the outer darkness ) D it a,b,c,d,e,ff 1 ,ff 2 ,h,q,r 1 syr s,c Irenaeus lat Lucifer  Δήσαντες αὐτοῦ πόδας καὶ χεῖρας ἐκβάλετε αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ σκότος τὸ ἐξώτερον ( After binding pl him [by] his feet and his hands, dispel pl him into the outer darkness ) א B L Θ 085 f 1 22 700 892 it aur,f,g 1 ,l vg syr p co Codex Schøyen Didymus  Δήσαντες αὐτοῦ πόδας καὶ χεῖρας ἄρατε αὐτόν καὶ ἐκβάλετε εἰς τὸ σκότος τὸ ἐξώτερον ( After binding pl him [by] his feet and his hands, take pl and dispel pl him into the outer darkness ) C (M) W Δ (Φ) 0102 33 (565) (579) (1241) (1424) Byz it f syr (h)   Βάλετε εἰς τὸ σκότος τὸ ἐξώτερον ( cast pl [him] into the outer darkness ) f 13    omits text Εἰπέ οὖν ἡμῖν ( Therefore, tell us ) with it a,b,d,e,ff 1 ,ff 2 ,q,r 1 syr s co bo ms Codex Schøyen  omits text τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ ( his wife )   ἄγγελοι ( angels ) B D E* Θ 0197 0233 f 1 22 700 it mss syr s,c co sa Codex Schøyen arm geo Origen Severus   ἄγγελοι θεοῦ ( angels of God ) א L Σ f 13 28 33 157 892 1071 1241 1243 1292 1424 it aur,ff 1 ,g 1 ,l vg syr h,p co bo   ἄγγελοι τοῦ θεοῦ ( angels of the God ) W Δ 0102 0161 565 579 Byz    εἰ οὖν Δαυὶδ ἐν πνεύματι καλεῖ αὐτὸν κύριον ( If then David in the Spirit calls him "Lord" ) D K Δ Θ 0281 f 13 565 1424 it mss vg mss syr h** mae-1 co bo mss   εἰ οὖν Δαυὶδ καλεῖ αὐτὸν κύριον ( If then David calls him "Lord" ) rell     ἐκείνης τῆς ὥρας ( from that hour ) D W f 1 1506 it a,d,q syr s,c co bo mss Origen  ἐκείνης τῆς ἡμέρας ( from that day ) rell     ῥαββί ῥαββί ( Rabbi!
