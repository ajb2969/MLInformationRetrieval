Thaine's theorem

In mathematics, Thaine's theorem is an analogue of Stickelberger's theorem for real abelian fields, introduced by . Thaine's method has been used to shorten the proof of the Mazur–Wiles theorem , to prove that some Tate–Shafarevich groups are finite, and in the proof of Mihăilescu's theorem .
Formulation
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be distinct odd primes with 
 
 
 
  not dividing 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the Galois group of 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be its group of units, let 
 
 
 
  be the subgroup of cyclotomic units, and let 
 
 
 
  be its class group. If 
 
 
 
  annihilates 
 
 
 
  then it annihilates 
 
 
 
 .
