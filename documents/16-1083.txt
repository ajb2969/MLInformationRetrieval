   Thaine's theorem      Thaine's theorem   In mathematics, Thaine's theorem is an analogue of Stickelberger's theorem for real abelian fields, introduced by . Thaine's method has been used to shorten the proof of the Mazur–Wiles theorem , to prove that some Tate–Shafarevich groups are finite, and in the proof of Mihăilescu's theorem .  Formulation  Let   p   p   p   and   q   q   q   be distinct odd primes with   q   q   q   not dividing    p  -  1      p  1    p-1   . Let    G  +     superscript  G     G^{+}   be the Galois group of    F  =   ℚ   (   ζ  p  +   )        F    ℚ   superscript   subscript  ζ  p        F=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{p}^{+})   over   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   , let   E   E   E   be its group of units, let   C   C   C   be the subgroup of cyclotomic units, and let    C   l  +       C   superscript  l      Cl^{+}   be its class group. If    θ  ∈   ℤ   [   G  +   ]        θ    ℤ   delimited-[]   superscript  G        \theta\in\mathbb{Z}[G^{+}]   annihilates     E  /  C    E  q         E  C    superscript  E  q     E/CE^{q}   then it annihilates      C   l  +    /  C    l   +  q            C   superscript  l     C    superscript  l    q      Cl^{+}/Cl^{+q}   .
