Cokurtosis

In probability theory and statistics, cokurtosis is a measure of how much two random variables change together. Cokurtosis is the fourth standardized cross central moment.1 If two random variables exhibit a high level of cokurtosis they will tend to undergo extreme positive and negative deviations at the same time.
Definition
For two random variables X and Y there are three non-trivial cokurtosis statistics 23





 
  and


 
  where E[X] is the expected value of X, also known as the mean of X, and 
 
 
 
 
  is the standard deviation of X.
Properties

Kurtosis is a special case of the cokurtosis when the two random variables are identical:







K(X,X,X,X) = {\operatorname{E}{\big[(X - \operatorname{E}[X])^4\big]} \over \sigma_X^4} = {\operatorname{kurtosis}\big[X\big]}, 

For two random variables, X and Y, the kurtosis of the sum, X + Y, is







\begin{align} K_{X+Y} = {1 \over \sigma_{X+Y}^4} \big[ & \sigma_X^4K_X + 4\sigma_X^3\sigma_YK(X,X,X,Y) + 6\sigma_X^2\sigma_Y^2K(X,X,Y,Y) \\ & {} + 4\sigma_X\sigma_Y^3K(X,Y,Y,Y) + \sigma_Y^4K_Y \big], \end{align} 

where 
 
 
 
  is the kurtosis of X and 
 
 
 
  is the standard deviation of X.
 


It follows that the sum of two random variables can have non-zero kurtosis (
 
 
 
 ) even if both random variables are have zero kurtosis in isolation (
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 ).
The cokurtosis between variables X and Y does not depend on the scale on which the variables are expressed. If we are analyzing the relationship between X and Y, the cokurtosis between X and Y will be the same as the cokurtosis between a + bX and c + dY, where a, b, c and d are constants.
