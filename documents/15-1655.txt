Thiazole synthase

Thiazole synthase (, thiG (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate:thiol sulfurtransferase.123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate + 2-iminoacetate + thiocarboxy-adenylate-[sulfur-carrier protein ThiS] 
 
 
 
  2-[(2R,5Z)-2-carboxy-4-methylthiazol-5(2H)-ylidene]ethyl phosphate + [sulfur-carrier protein ThiS] + 2 H2O
 

H2S can provide the sulfur in vitro.
