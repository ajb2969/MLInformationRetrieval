   Complex reflection group      Complex reflection group   In mathematics , a complex reflection group is a group acting on a finite-dimensional complex vector space, that is generated by complex reflections : non-trivial elements that fix a complex hyperplane in space pointwise. (Complex reflections are sometimes called pseudo reflections or unitary reflections or sometimes just reflections.)  Classification  Any real reflection group becomes a complex reflection group if we extend the scalars from R to C . In particular all Coxeter groups or Weyl groups give examples of complex reflection groups.  Any finite complex reflection group is a product of irreducible complex reflection groups, acting on the sum of the corresponding vector spaces. So it is sufficient to classify the irreducible complex reflection groups.  The finite irreducible complex reflection groups were classified by . They found an infinite family G ( m , p , n ) depending on 3 positive integer parameters (with p dividing m ), and 34 exceptional cases, that they numbered from 4 to 37, listed below. The group G ( m , p , n ), of order m n n !/ p , is the semidirect product of the abelian group of order m n / p whose elements are (θ a 1 ,θ a 2 , ...,θ a n ), by the symmetric group S n acting by permutations of the coordinates, where θ is a primitive m th root of unity and Σ a i ≡ 0 mod p ; it is an index p subgroup of the generalized symmetric group      S   (  m  ,  n  )    .      S   m  n     S(m,n).     Special cases of G ( m , p , n ):   G ( 1 , 1 , n ) is the Coxeter group A n −1  G ( 2 , 1 , n ) is the Coxeter group B n = C n  G ( 2 , 2 , n ) is the Coxeter group D n  G ( m , p , 1 ) is a cyclic group of order m / p .  G ( m , m , 2 ) is the Coxeter group I 2 ( m ) (and the Weyl group G 2 when m = 6).  The group G ( m , p , n ) acts irreducibly on C n except in the cases m =1, n >1 (symmetric group) and G (2,2,2) (Klein 4 group), when C n splits as a sum of irreducible representations of dimensions 1 and n −1.  The only cases when two groups G ( m , p , n ) are isomorphic as complex reflection groups are that G ( ma , pa ,1) is isomorphic to G ( mb , pb ,1) for any positive integers a , b . However there are other cases when two such groups are isomorphic as abstract groups.  The complex reflection group G (2,2,3) is isomorphic as a complex reflection group to G (1,1,4) restricted to a 3-dimensional space.  The complex reflection group G (3,3,2) is isomorphic as a complex reflection group to G (1,1,3) restricted to a 2-dimensional space.  The complex reflection group G (2 p , p ,1) is isomorphic as a complex reflection group to G (1,1,2) restricted to a 1-dimensional space.   List of irreducible complex reflection groups  There are a few duplicates in the first 3 lines of this list; see the previous section for details.   ST is the Shephard–Todd number of the reflection group.  Rank is the dimension of the complex vector space the group acts on.  Structure describes the structure of the group. The symbol * stands for a central product of two groups. For rank 2, the quotient by the (cyclic) center is the group of rotations of a tetrahedron, octahedron, or icosahedron ( T = Alt(4), O = Sym(4), I = Alt(5), of orders 12, 24, 60), as stated in the table. For the notation 2 1+4 , see extra special group .  Order is the number of elements of the group.  Reflections describes the number of reflections: 2 6 4 12 means that there are 6 reflections of order 2 and 12 of order 4.  Degrees gives the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the ring of polynomial invariants. For example, the invariants of group number 4 form a polynomial ring with 2 generators of degrees 4 and 6.

Degrees  Shephard and Todd proved that a finite group acting on a complex vector space is a complex reflection group if and only if its ring of invariants is a polynomial ring ( Chevalley–Shephard–Todd theorem ). For   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   being the rank of the reflection group, the degrees     d  1   ≤   d  2   ≤  …  ≤   d  ℓ          subscript  d  1    subscript  d  2        normal-…        subscript  d  normal-ℓ      d_{1}\leq d_{2}\leq\ldots\leq d_{\ell}   of the generators of the ring of invariants are called degrees of W and are listed in the column above headed "degrees". They also showed that many other invariants of the group are determined by the degrees as follows:   The center of an irreducible reflection group is cyclic of order equal to the greatest common divisor of the degrees.    The order of a complex reflection group is the product of its degrees.    The number of reflections is the sum of the degrees minus the rank.    An irreducible complex reflection group comes from a real reflection group if and only if it has an invariant of degree 2.    The degrees d i satisfy the formula       ∏   i  =  1   ℓ    (    q  +   d  i    -  1   )    =    ∑   w  ∈  W     q   dim   (   V  w   )       .        superscript   subscript  product    i  1    normal-ℓ       q   subscript  d  i    1      subscript     w  W     superscript  q   dimension   superscript  V  w        \prod_{i=1}^{\ell}(q+d_{i}-1)=\sum_{w\in W}q^{\dim(V^{w})}.      Codegrees  For   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   being the rank of the reflection group, the codegrees     d  1  *   ≥   d  2  *   ≥  …  ≥   d  ℓ  *          subscript   superscript  d    1    subscript   superscript  d    2        normal-…        subscript   superscript  d    normal-ℓ      d^{*}_{1}\geq d^{*}_{2}\geq\ldots\geq d^{*}_{\ell}   of W can be defined by       ∏   i  =  1   ℓ    (   q  -   d  i  *   -  1   )    =    ∑   w  ∈  W     det    (  w  )    q   dim   (   V  w   )         .        superscript   subscript  product    i  1    normal-ℓ     q   subscript   superscript  d    i   1      subscript     w  W        w   superscript  q   dimension   superscript  V  w          \prod_{i=1}^{\ell}(q-d^{*}_{i}-1)=\sum_{w\in W}\det(w)q^{\dim(V^{w})}.      For a real reflection group, the codegrees are the degrees minus 2.    The number of reflection hyperplanes is the sum of the codegrees plus the rank.   Well-generated complex reflection groups  An irreducible complex reflection group of rank    ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   is generated by   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   or by    ℓ  +  1      normal-ℓ  1    \ell+1   reflections. It is said to be well-generated if it is generated by   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   reflections ; it is proved that this is equivalent to the property      d  i   +   d  i  *    =   d  ℓ          subscript  d  i    subscript   superscript  d    i     subscript  d  normal-ℓ     d_{i}+d^{*}_{i}=d_{\ell}   for all    1  ≤  i  ≤  ℓ        1  i       normal-ℓ     1\leq i\leq\ell   . For irreducible well-generated complex reflection groups, the Coxeter number   h   h   h   is defined to be the largest degree,    h  :=   d  ℓ      assign  h   subscript  d  normal-ℓ     h:=d_{\ell}   . A reducible complex reflection group is said to be well-generated if it is a product of irreducible well-generated complex reflection groups. Any finite real reflection group is well-generated.
