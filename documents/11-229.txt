Octopamine dehydratase

In enzymology, an octopamine dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-aminoethanol 
 
 
 
  (4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde + NH3


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-aminoethanol, and two products, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-aminoethanol hydro-lyase [deaminating (4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde-forming]. Other names in common use include octopamine hydrolyase, and octopamine hydro-lyase (deaminating).
