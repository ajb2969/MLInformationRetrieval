Thiamine oxidase

In enzymology, a thiamine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction


thiamine + 2 O2 + H2O 
 
 
 
  thiamine acetic acid + 2 H2O2




The 3 substrates of this enzyme are thiamine, O2, and H2O, whereas its two products are thiamine acetic acid and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is thiamine:oxygen 5-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include thiamin dehydrogenase, thiamine dehydrogenase, and thiamin:oxygen 5-oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in thiamine metabolism. It employs one cofactor, FAD.
