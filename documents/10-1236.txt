   Thiamine oxidase      Thiamine oxidase   In enzymology , a thiamine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction    thiamine + 2 O 2 + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   thiamine acetic acid + 2 H 2 O 2      The 3 substrates of this enzyme are thiamine , O 2 , and H 2 O , whereas its two products are thiamine acetic acid and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is thiamine:oxygen 5-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include thiamin dehydrogenase , thiamine dehydrogenase , and thiamin:oxygen 5-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in thiamine metabolism . It employs one cofactor , FAD .  References       "  Category:EC 1.1.3  Category:Flavin enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
