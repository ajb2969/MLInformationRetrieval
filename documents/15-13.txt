Negativity (quantum mechanics)
In [[quantum mechanics]], '''negativity''' is a measure of [[quantum entanglement]] which is easy to compute. It is a measure deriving fr
 om the PPT criterion for separability.1 It has shown to be an entanglement monotone 23 and hence a proper measure of entanglement.
Definition
The negativity of a subsystem 
 
 
 
  can be defined in terms of a density matrix

 
  as:



where:



 
  is the partial transpose of 
 
 
 
  with respect to subsystem 
 
 



 
  is the trace norm or the sum of the singular values of the operator 
 
 
 
 .

An alternative and equivalent definition is the absolute sum of the negative eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
 :


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are all of the eigenvalues.
Properties

Is a convex function of 
 
 
 
 :





Is an entanglement monotone:



 
  where 
 
 
 
  is an arbitrary LOCC operation over 
 
 

Logarithmic negativity
The logarithmic negativity is an entanglement measure which is easily computable and an upper bound to the distillable entanglement.4 It is defined as


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the partial transpose operation and 
 
 
 
  denotes the trace norm.
It relates to the negativity as follows:5



Properties
The logarithmic negativity

can be zero even if the state is entangled (if the state is PPT entangled).
does not reduce to the entropy of entanglement on pure states like most other entanglement measures.
is additive on tensor products
 
 

is not asymptotically continuous. That means that for a sequence of bipartite Hilbert spaces 
 
 
 
  (typically with increasing dimension) we can have a sequence of quantum states 
 
 
 
  which converges to 
 
 
 
  (typically with increasing 
 
 
 
 ) in the trace distance, but the sequence 
 
 
 
  does not converge to 
 
 
 
 .
is an upper bound to the distillable entanglement
