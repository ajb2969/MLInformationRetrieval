   Negativity (quantum mechanics)      Negativity (quantum mechanics)  In [[quantum mechanics]], '''negativity''' is a measure of [[quantum entanglement]] which is easy to compute. It is a measure deriving fr om the PPT criterion for separability . 1 It has shown to be an entanglement monotone  2 3 and hence a proper measure of entanglement.  Definition  The negativity of a subsystem   A   A   A   can be defined in terms of a density matrix    ρ   ρ   \rho   as:       𝒩   (  ρ  )    ≡      ||   ρ   Γ  A    ||   1   -  1   2         𝒩  ρ        subscript   norm   superscript  ρ   subscript  normal-Γ  A     1   1   2     \mathcal{N}(\rho)\equiv\frac{||\rho^{\Gamma_{A}}||_{1}-1}{2}     where:       ρ   Γ  A      superscript  ρ   subscript  normal-Γ  A     \rho^{\Gamma_{A}}   is the partial transpose of   ρ   ρ   \rho   with respect to subsystem   A   A   A           ||  X  ||   1   =   Tr   |  X  |    =   Tr     X  †   X            subscript   norm  X   1     Tr    X           Tr       superscript  X  normal-†   X        ||X||_{1}=\text{Tr}|X|=\text{Tr}\sqrt{X^{\dagger}X}   is the trace norm or the sum of the singular values of the operator   X   X   X   .   An alternative and equivalent definition is the absolute sum of the negative eigenvalues of    ρ   Γ  A      superscript  ρ   subscript  normal-Γ  A     \rho^{\Gamma_{A}}   :       𝒩   (  ρ  )    =    ∑  i      |   λ  i   |   -   λ  i    2          𝒩  ρ     subscript   i          subscript  λ  i     subscript  λ  i    2      \mathcal{N}(\rho)=\sum_{i}\frac{|\lambda_{i}|-\lambda_{i}}{2}   where    λ  i     subscript  λ  i    \lambda_{i}   are all of the eigenvalues.

It relates to the negativity as follows: 5        E  N    (  ρ  )    :=    log  2    (    2  𝒩   +  1   )       assign     subscript  E  N   ρ     subscript   2       2  𝒩   1      E_{N}(\rho):=\log_{2}(2\mathcal{N}+1)     Properties  The logarithmic negativity   can be zero even if the state is entangled (if the state is PPT entangled ).  does not reduce to the entropy of entanglement on pure states like most other entanglement measures.  is additive on tensor products      E  N    (   ρ  ⊗  σ   )    =     E  N    (  ρ  )    +    E  N    (  σ  )            subscript  E  N    tensor-product  ρ  σ         subscript  E  N   ρ      subscript  E  N   σ      E_{N}(\rho\otimes\sigma)=E_{N}(\rho)+E_{N}(\sigma)     is not asymptotically continuous.
