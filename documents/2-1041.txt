   Direct limit      Direct limit   In mathematics , a direct limit (also called inductive limit ) is a colimit of a "directed family of objects". We will first give the definition for algebraic structures like groups and modules , and then the general definition, which can be used in any category .  Formal definition  Algebraic objects  In this section objects are understood to be sets with a given algebraic structure such as groups , rings , modules (over a fixed ring), algebras (over a fixed field), etc. With this in mind, homomorphisms are understood in the corresponding setting ( group homomorphisms , etc.).  Start with the definition of a direct system of objects and homomorphisms. Let    ‚ü®  I  ,  ‚â§  ‚ü©     I     \langle I,\leq\rangle   be a directed set . Let    {   A  i   :   i  ‚àà  I   }     conditional-set   subscript  A  i     i  I     \{A_{i}:i\in I\}   be a family of objects indexed by    I    I   I\,   and     f   i  j    :    A  i   ‚Üí   A  j       normal-:   subscript  f    i  j     normal-‚Üí   subscript  A  i    subscript  A  j      f_{ij}:A_{i}\rightarrow A_{j}   be a homomorphism for all    i  ‚â§  j      i  j    i\leq j   with the following properties:        f   i  i       subscript  f    i  i     f_{ii}\,   is the identity of     A  i      subscript  A  i    A_{i}\,   , and       f   i  k    =    f   j  k    ‚àò   f   i  j          subscript  f    i  k       subscript  f    j  k     subscript  f    i  j       f_{ik}=f_{jk}\circ f_{ij}   for all    i  ‚â§  j  ‚â§  k        i  j       k     i\leq j\leq k   .   Then the pair    ‚ü®   A  i   ,   f   i  j    ‚ü©      subscript  A  i    subscript  f    i  j      \langle A_{i},f_{ij}\rangle   is called a direct system over    I    I   I\,   .  The underlying set of the direct limit ,    A    A   A\,   , of the direct system    ‚ü®   A  i   ,   f   i  j    ‚ü©      subscript  A  i    subscript  f    i  j      \langle A_{i},f_{ij}\rangle   is defined as the disjoint union of the     A  i      subscript  A  i    A_{i}\,   's modulo a certain equivalence relation    ‚àº   similar-to   \sim\,   :       lim  ‚Üí    A  i   =   ‚äî  i    A  i   /  ‚àº  .     fragments  injective-limit   subscript  A  i     subscript  square-union  i    subscript  A  i    similar-to  normal-.    \underrightarrow{\lim}A_{i}=\bigsqcup_{i}A_{i}\bigg/\sim.   Here, if     x  i   ‚àà   A  i        subscript  x  i    subscript  A  i     x_{i}\in A_{i}   and     x  j   ‚àà   A  j        subscript  x  j    subscript  A  j     x_{j}\in A_{j}   ,     x  i   ‚àº   x  j      similar-to   subscript  x  i    subscript  x  j     x_{i}\sim\,x_{j}   if there is some    k  ‚àà  I      k  I    k\in I   such that      f   i  k     (   x  i   )    =    f   j  k     (   x  j   )           subscript  f    i  k     subscript  x  i       subscript  f    j  k     subscript  x  j      f_{ik}(x_{i})=f_{jk}(x_{j})\,   . Heuristically, two elements in the disjoint union are equivalent if and only if they "eventually become equal" in the direct system. An equivalent formulation that highlights the duality to the inverse limit is that an element is equivalent to all its images under the maps of the directed system, i.e.     x  i   ‚àº    f   i  k     (   x  i   )       similar-to   subscript  x  i      subscript  f    i  k     subscript  x  i      x_{i}\sim\,f_{ik}(x_{i})   .  One naturally obtains from this definition canonical morphisms      œï  i   :    A  i   ‚Üí  A      normal-:   subscript  œï  i    normal-‚Üí   subscript  A  i   A     \phi_{i}:A_{i}\rightarrow A   sending each element to its equivalence class. The algebraic operations on    A    A   A\,   are defined via these maps in the obvious manner.  An important property is that taking direct limits in the category of modules is an exact functor .  Direct limit over a direct system in a category  The direct limit can be defined in an arbitrary category    ùíû   ùíû   \mathcal{C}   by means of a universal property . Let    ‚ü®   X  i   ,   f   i  j    ‚ü©      subscript  X  i    subscript  f    i  j      \langle X_{i},f_{ij}\rangle   be a direct system of objects and morphisms in   ùíû   ùíû   \mathcal{C}   (same definition as above). The direct limit of this system is an object    X    X   X\,   in   ùíû   ùíû   \mathcal{C}   together with morphisms     œï  i   :    X  i   ‚Üí  X      normal-:   subscript  œï  i    normal-‚Üí   subscript  X  i   X     \phi_{i}:X_{i}\rightarrow X   satisfying     œï  i   =    œï  j   ‚àò   f   i  j          subscript  œï  i      subscript  œï  j    subscript  f    i  j       \phi_{i}=\phi_{j}\circ f_{ij}   . The pair    ‚ü®  X  ,   œï  i   ‚ü©     X   subscript  œï  i     \langle X,\phi_{i}\rangle   must be universal in the sense that for any other such pair    ‚ü®  Y  ,   œà  i   ‚ü©     Y   subscript  œà  i     \langle Y,\psi_{i}\rangle   there exists a unique morphism    u  :   X  ‚Üí  Y      normal-:  u   normal-‚Üí  X  Y     u:X\rightarrow Y   making the diagram   (Figure)  Direct limit category.svg    commute for all i , j . The direct limit is often denoted      X  =    lim  ‚Üí    X  i        X   injective-limit   subscript  X  i      X=\underrightarrow{\lim}X_{i}   with the direct system    ‚ü®   X  i   ,   f   i  j    ‚ü©      subscript  X  i    subscript  f    i  j      \langle X_{i},f_{ij}\rangle   being understood.  Unlike for algebraic objects, the direct limit may not exist in an arbitrary category. If it does, however, it is unique in a strong sense: given another direct limit X ‚Ä≤ there exists a unique  isomorphism  X ‚Ä≤ ‚Üí X commuting with the canonical morphisms.  We note that a direct system in a category   ùíû   ùíû   \mathcal{C}   admits an alternative description in terms of functors . Any directed poset    ‚ü®  I  ,  ‚â§  ‚ü©     I     \langle I,\leq\rangle   can be considered as a small category    ‚Ñê   ‚Ñê   \mathcal{I}   where the morphisms consist of arrows    i  ‚Üí  j     normal-‚Üí  i  j    i\rightarrow j    if and only if     i  ‚â§  j      i  j    i\leq j   . A direct system is then just a covariant functor     ‚Ñê  ‚Üí  ùíû     normal-‚Üí  ‚Ñê  ùíû    \mathcal{I}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}   . In this case a direct limit is a colimit .  Examples   A collection of subsets    M  i     subscript  M  i    M_{i}   of a set M can be partially ordered by inclusion. If the collection is directed, its direct limit is the union    ‚ãÉ   M  i        subscript  M  i     \bigcup M_{i}   .  Let I be any directed set with a greatest element  m . The direct limit of any corresponding direct system is isomorphic to X m and the canonical morphism œÜ m : X m ‚Üí X is an isomorphism.  Let p be a prime number . Consider the direct system composed of the groups Z / p n Z and the homomorphisms Z / p n Z ‚Üí Z / p n +1 Z induced by multiplication by p . The direct limit of this system consists of all the roots of unity of order some power of p , and is called the Pr√ºfer group  Z ( p ‚àû ).  Let F be a C -valued sheaf on a topological space  X . Fix a point x in X . The open neighborhoods of x form a directed poset ordered by inclusion ( U ‚â§ V if and only if U contains V ). The corresponding direct system is ( F ( U ), r U , V ) where r is the restriction map. The direct limit of this system is called the stalk of F at x , denoted F x . For each neighborhood U of x , the canonical morphism F ( U ) ‚Üí F x associates to a section s of F over U an element s x of the stalk F x called the germ of s at x .  Direct limits in the category of topological spaces are given by placing the final topology on the underlying set-theoretic direct limit.  Direct limits are linked to inverse limits via         Hom   (    lim  ‚Üí    X  i    ,  Y  )    =    lim  ‚Üê    Hom   (   X  i   ,  Y  )      .        Hom    injective-limit   subscript  X  i    Y     projective-limit    Hom    subscript  X  i   Y       \mathrm{Hom}(\underrightarrow{\lim}X_{i},Y)=\underleftarrow{\lim}\mathrm{Hom}(%
 X_{i},Y).      Consider a sequence { A n , œÜ n } where A n is a C*-algebra and œÜ n : A n ‚Üí A n + 1 is a *-homomorphism. The C*-analog of the direct limit construction gives a C*-algebra satisfying the universal property above.   Related constructions and generalizations  The categorical dual of the direct limit is called the inverse limit (or projective limit). More general concepts are the limits and colimits of category theory. The terminology is somewhat confusing: direct limits are colimits while inverse limits are limits.
