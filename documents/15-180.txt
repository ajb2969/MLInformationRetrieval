   Kinetic triangulation      Kinetic triangulation   A Kinetic Triangulation data structure is a kinetic data structure that maintains a triangulation of a set of moving points. Maintaining a kinetic triangulation is important for applications that involve motion planning , such as video games, virtual reality, dynamic simulations and robotics. 1  Choosing a triangulation scheme  The efficiency of a kinetic data structure is defined based on the ratio of the number of internal events to external events, thus good runtime bounds can sometimes be obtained by choosing to use a triangulation scheme that generates a small number of external events. For simple affine motion of the points, the number of discrete changes to the convex hull is estimated by     Ω   (   n  2   )       normal-Ω   superscript  n  2     \Omega(n^{2})   , 2 thus the number of changes to any triangulation is also lower bounded by    Ω   (   n  2   )       normal-Ω   superscript  n  2     \Omega(n^{2})   . Finding any triangulation scheme that has a near-quadratic bound on the number of discrete changes is an important open problem. 3  Delaunay triangulation  The Delaunay triangulation seems like a natural candidate, but a tight analysis of the number of discrete changes that will occur to the Delaunay triangulation (external events) is one of the hardest problems in computational geometry, 4 and the best currently known upper bound is    O   (   n  3   )       O   superscript  n  3     O(n^{3})   .  There is a kinetic data structure that efficiently maintains the Delaunay triangulation of a set of moving points, 5 in which the ratio of the total number of events to the number of external events is    O   (  1  )       O  1    O(1)   .  Other triangulations  Kaplan et al. developed a randomized triangulation scheme that experiences an expected number of    O   (    n  2    β   s  +  2     (  n  )     log  2   n    )       O     superscript  n  2    subscript  β    s  2    n    superscript   2   n      O(n^{2}\beta_{s+2}(n)\log^{2}n)   external events, where   s   s   s   is the maximum number of times each triple of points can become collinear,      β   s  +  2     (  q  )    =     λ   s  +  2     (  q  )    q          subscript  β    s  2    q        subscript  λ    s  2    q   q     \beta_{s+2}(q)=\frac{\lambda_{s+2}(q)}{q}   , and     λ   s  +  2     (  q  )        subscript  λ    s  2    q    \lambda_{s+2}(q)   is the maximum length of a Davenport-Schinzel sequence of order s + 2 on n symbols. 6  Pseudo-triangulations  There is a kinetic data structure (due to Agarwal et al.) which maintains a pseudo-triangulation in    O   (    n  2    2    log   n   log   log  n         )       O     superscript  n  2    superscript  2        n      n           O(n^{2}2^{\sqrt{\log n\log\log n}})   events total. 7 All events are external and require    O   (   lg  n   )       O   lg  n     O(\lg n)   time to process.
