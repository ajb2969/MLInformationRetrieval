Coherent information

Coherent information is an entropy measure used in quantum information theory. It is a property of a quantum state œÅ and a quantum channel

 
 ; intuitively, it attempts to describe how much of the quantum information in the state will remain after the state goes through the channel. In this sense, it is intuitively similar to the mutual information of classical information theory. The coherent information is written 
 
 
 
 .
Definition
The coherent information is defined as 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is the von Neumann entropy of the output and 
 
 
 
  is the entropy exchange between the state and the channel.
History
The coherent information was introduced by Benjamin Schumacher and Michael A. Nielsen in a 1996 paper Quantum data processing and error correction, which appeared in Physical Review A.
