Trapping region

In applied mathematics, a trapping region of a dynamical system is a region such that every trajectory that starts within the trapping region will move to the region's interior and remain there as the system evolves.
More precisely, given a dynamical system with flow

 
  defined on the phase space 
 
 
 
 , a subset of the phase space 
 
 
 
  is a trapping region if it is compact and 
 
 
 
 
  for all
