   Trapping region      Trapping region   In applied mathematics , a trapping region of a dynamical system is a region such that every trajectory that starts within the trapping region will move to the region's interior and remain there as the system evolves.  More precisely, given a dynamical system with flow     ϕ  t     subscript  ϕ  t    \phi_{t}   defined on the phase space   D   D   D   , a subset of the phase space   N   N   N   is a trapping region if it is compact and      ϕ  t    (  N  )    ⊂   int   (  N  )           subscript  ϕ  t   N     int  N     \phi_{t}(N)\subset\mathrm{int}(N)   for all    t  >  0      t  0    t>0   . 1  References  "  Category:Dynamical systems  Category:Systems  Category:Systems theory     Meiss, J.
