   Indolelactate dehydrogenase      Indolelactate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , an indolelactate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (indol-3-yl)lactate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (indol-3-yl)pyruvate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (indol-3-yl)lactate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are (indol-3-yl)pyruvate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (indol-3-yl)lactate:NAD + oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called indolelactate:NAD + oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
