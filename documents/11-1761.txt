   Semi-s-cobordism      Semi-s-cobordism   In mathematics , a cobordism ( W , M , M − ) of an ( n + 1)-dimensionsal manifold (with boundary) W between its boundary components, two n -manifolds M and M − , is called a semi- s -cobordism if (and only if) the inclusion    M  ↪  W     normal-↪  M  W    M\hookrightarrow W   is a simple homotopy equivalence (as in an s -cobordism ) but the inclusion     M  -   ↪  W     normal-↪   superscript  M    W    M^{-}\hookrightarrow W   is not a homotopy equivalence at all.  Other notations  the original creator of this topic, Jean-Claude Hausmann, used the notation M − for the right-hand boundary of the cobordism.  Properties  A consequence of ( W , M , M − ) being a semi- s -cobordism is that the kernel of the derived homomorphism on fundamental groups     K  =   ker   (     π  1    (   M  -   )    ↠    π  1    (  W  )     )        K   kernel   normal-↠     subscript  π  1    superscript  M        subscript  π  1   W       K=\ker(\pi_{1}(M^{-})\twoheadrightarrow\pi_{1}(W))   is perfect . A corollary of this is that     π  1    (   M  -   )        subscript  π  1    superscript  M      \pi_{1}(M^{-})   solves the group extension problem     1  →  K  →    π  1    (   M  -   )    →    π  1    (  M  )    →  1       normal-→  1  K    normal-→       subscript  π  1    superscript  M       normal-→       subscript  π  1   M     normal-→    1     1\rightarrow K\rightarrow\pi_{1}(M^{-})\rightarrow\pi_{1}(M)\rightarrow 1   . The solutions to the group extension problem for proscribed quotient group      π  1    (  M  )        subscript  π  1   M    \pi_{1}(M)   and kernel group K are classified up to congruence (see Homology by MacLane, e.g.), so there are restrictions on which n-manifolds can be the right-hand boundary of a semi- s -cobordism with proscribed left-hand boundary M and superperfect kernel group K.  Relationship with Plus cobordisms  Note that if ( W , M , M − ) is a semi- s -cobordism, then ( W , M − , M ) is a Plus cobordism . (This justifies the use of M − for the right-hand boundary of a semi- s -cobordism, a play on the traditional use of M + for the right-hand boundary of a Plus cobordism.) Thus, a semi- s -cobordism may be thought of as an inverse to Quillen's Plus construction in the manifold category. Note that ( M − ) + must be diffeomorphic (respectively, piecewise-linearly (PL) homeomorphic ) to M but there may be a variety of choices for ( M + ) − for a given closed smooth (respectively, PL ) manifold M .
