Semi-s-cobordism

In mathematics, a cobordism (W, M, M−) of an (n + 1)-dimensionsal manifold (with boundary) W between its boundary components, two n-manifolds M and M−, is called a semi-s-cobordism if (and only if) the inclusion 
 
 
 
  is a simple homotopy equivalence (as in an s-cobordism) but the inclusion 
 
 
 
  is not a homotopy equivalence at all.
Other notations
the original creator of this topic, Jean-Claude Hausmann, used the notation M− for the right-hand boundary of the cobordism.
Properties
A consequence of (W, M, M−) being a semi-s-cobordism is that the kernel of the derived homomorphism on fundamental groups

 
  is perfect. A corollary of this is that 
 
 
 
  solves the group extension problem

 
 . The solutions to the group extension problem for proscribed quotient group

 
  and kernel group K are classified up to congruence (see Homology by MacLane, e.g.), so there are restrictions on which n-manifolds can be the right-hand boundary of a semi-s-cobordism with proscribed left-hand boundary M and superperfect kernel group K.
Relationship with Plus cobordisms
Note that if (W, M, M−) is a semi-s-cobordism, then (W, M−, M) is a Plus cobordism. (This justifies the use of M− for the right-hand boundary of a semi-s-cobordism, a play on the traditional use of M+ for the right-hand boundary of a Plus cobordism.) Thus, a semi-s-cobordism may be thought of as an inverse to Quillen's Plus construction in the manifold category. Note that (M−)+ must be diffeomorphic (respectively, piecewise-linearly (PL) homeomorphic) to M but there may be a variety of choices for (M+)− for a given closed smooth (respectively, PL) manifold M.
