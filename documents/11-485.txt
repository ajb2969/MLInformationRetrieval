Glucose-1-phosphatase




Glucose-1-phosphatase

In enzymology, a glucose-1-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-glucose + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are D-glucose and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate phosphohydrolase. This enzyme participates in glycolysis / gluconeogenesis.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
