   Gaussian beam      Gaussian beam   In optics , a Gaussian beam is a beam of electromagnetic radiation whose transverse electric field and intensity (irradiance) distributions are well approximated by Gaussian functions . Many lasers emit beams that approximate a Gaussian profile, in which case the laser is said to be operating on the fundamental transverse mode , or "TEM 00 mode" of the laser's optical resonator . When refracted by a diffraction-limited  lens , a Gaussian beam is transformed into another Gaussian beam (characterized by a different set of parameters), which explains why it is a convenient, widespread model in laser optics.  The mathematical function that describes the Gaussian beam is a solution to the paraxial form of the Helmholtz equation . The solution, in the form of a Gaussian function, represents the complex amplitude of the beam's electric field. The electric field and magnetic field together propagate as an electromagnetic wave . A description of just one of the two fields is sufficient to describe the properties of the beam.  The behavior of the field of a Gaussian beam as it propagates is described by a few parameters such as the spot size, the radius of curvature, and the Gouy phase. 1  Other solutions to the paraxial form of the Helmholtz equation exist. Solving the equation in Cartesian coordinates leads to a family of solutions known as the Hermite–Gaussian modes, while solving the equation in cylindrical coordinates leads to the Laguerre–Gaussian modes. 2 3 For both families, the lowest-order solution describes a Gaussian beam, while higher-order solutions describe higher-order transverse modes in an optical resonator.  Mathematical form  The Gaussian beam is a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) mode . 4 A mathematical expression for its complex electric field amplitude can be found by solving the paraxial Helmholtz equation, yielding 5        E   (  r  ,  z  )    =    E  0     w  0    w   (  z  )      exp   (      -   r  2     w    (  z  )   2     -   i  k  z   -   i  k    r  2    2  R   (  z  )       +   i  ζ   (  z  )     )      ,        E   r  z       subscript  E  0      subscript  w  0     w  z               superscript  r  2      w   superscript  z  2       i  k  z     i  k     superscript  r  2     2  R  z        i  ζ  z        E(r,z)=E_{0}\frac{w_{0}}{w(z)}\exp\left(\frac{-r^{2}}{w(z)^{2}}-ikz-ik\frac{r^%

Additionally, the field has a time dependence factor    e   i  ω  t      superscript  e    i  ω  t     e^{i\omega t}   that has been suppressed in the above expression.  The corresponding time-averaged intensity (or irradiance ) distribution is        I   (  r  ,  z  )    =     |   E   (  r  ,  z  )    |   2    2  η    =    I  0     (    w  0    w   (  z  )     )   2    exp   (    -   2   r  2       w  2    (  z  )     )      ,          I   r  z       superscript      E   r  z     2     2  η            subscript  I  0    superscript     subscript  w  0     w  z    2           2   superscript  r  2        superscript  w  2   z         I(r,z)={|E(r,z)|^{2}\over 2\eta}=I_{0}\left(\frac{w_{0}}{w(z)}\right)^{2}\exp%
 \left(\frac{-2r^{2}}{w^{2}(z)}\right)\ ,     where     I  0   =   I   (  0  ,  0  )         subscript  I  0     I   0  0      I_{0}=I(0,0)   is the intensity at the center of the beam at its waist. The constant    η    η   \eta\,   is the characteristic impedance of the medium in which the beam is propagating. For free space,    η  =   η  0   =     μ  0   /   ε  0     =   1  /   (    ε  0   c   )    ≈    376.7   Ω         η   subscript  η  0             subscript  μ  0    subscript  ε  0            1     subscript  ε  0   c           376.7  normal-Ω      \eta=\eta_{0}=\sqrt{\mu_{0}/\varepsilon_{0}}=1/(\varepsilon_{0}c)\approx 376.7\ \Omega   .  Beam parameters  The geometry and behavior of a Gaussian beam are governed by a set of beam parameters , which are defined in the following sections.  Beam width or spot size  (Figure)  Gaussian beam width w ( z ) as a function of the distance z along the beam. w 0 : beam waist; b : depth of focus; z R : Rayleigh range ;   Θ   normal-Θ   \Theta   : total angular spread   For a Gaussian beam propagating in free space, the spot size (radius) w ( z ) will be at a minimum value w 0 at one place along the beam axis, known as the beam waist . For a beam of wavelength λ at a distance z along the beam from the beam waist, the variation of the spot size is given by 7        w   (  z  )    =     w  0       1  +    (   z   z  R    )   2        .        w  z      subscript  w  0       1   superscript    z   subscript  z  normal-R    2        w(z)=w_{0}\,\sqrt{1+{\left(\frac{z}{z_{\mathrm{R}}}\right)}^{2}}\ .     where the origin of the z-axis is defined, without loss of generality, to coincide with the beam waist, and where 8       z  R   =    π   w  0  2    λ        subscript  z  normal-R       π   superscript   subscript  w  0   2    λ     z_{\mathrm{R}}=\frac{\pi w_{0}^{2}}{\lambda}     is called the Rayleigh range .  Rayleigh range and confocal parameter  At a distance from the waist equal to the Rayleigh range z R , the width w of the beam is 9        w   (   ±   z  R    )    =    2    w  0     .        w   plus-or-minus   subscript  z  normal-R         2    subscript  w  0      w(\pm z_{\mathrm{R}})=\sqrt{2}w_{0}.     The distance between these two points is called the confocal parameter or depth of focus of the beam:       b  =   2   z  R    =     2  π   w  0  2    λ     .        b    2   subscript  z  normal-R             2  π   superscript   subscript  w  0   2    λ      b=2z_{\mathrm{R}}=\frac{2\pi w_{0}^{2}}{\lambda}\ .     Radius of curvature  R ( z ) is the radius of curvature of the wavefronts comprising the beam. Its value as a function of position is 10        R   (  z  )    =   z   [   1  +    (    z  R   z   )   2    ]     .        R  z     z   delimited-[]    1   superscript     subscript  z  normal-R   z   2        R(z)=z\left[{1+{\left(\frac{z_{\mathrm{R}}}{z}\right)}^{2}}\right]\ .     Beam divergence  The parameter    w   (  z  )       w  z    w(z)   increases linearly with   z   z   z   for    z  ≫   z  R      much-greater-than  z   subscript  z  normal-R     z\gg z_{\mathrm{R}}   . This means that far from the waist, the beam is cone-shaped. The angle between the straight line    r  =   w   (  z  )        r    w  z     r=w(z)   and the central axis of the beam (    r  =  0      r  0    r=0   ) is called the divergence of the beam. It is given by 11       θ  ≃    λ   π   w  0      (    θ    in   radians   )     .     similar-to-or-equals  θ     λ    π   subscript  w  0       θ  in  radians      \theta\simeq\frac{\lambda}{\pi w_{0}}\qquad(\theta\mathrm{\ in\ radians}).     The total angular spread of the beam far from the waist is then given by       Θ  =   2   θ     .      normal-Θ    2  θ     \Theta=2\theta\ .     Because the divergence is inversely proportional to the spot size, a Gaussian beam that is focused to a small spot spreads out rapidly as it propagates away from that spot. To keep a laser beam very well collimated , it must have a large diameter. This relationship between beam width and divergence is due to diffraction . Non-Gaussian beams also exhibit this effect, but a Gaussian beam is a special case where the product of width and divergence is the smallest possible.  Since the gaussian beam model uses the paraxial approximation, it fails when wavefronts are tilted by more than about 30° from the axis of the beam. 12 From the above expression for divergence, this means the Gaussian beam model is valid only for beams with waists larger than about     2  λ   /  π        2  λ   π    2\lambda/\pi   .  Laser beam quality is quantified by the beam parameter product (BPP). For a Gaussian beam, the BPP is the product of the beam's divergence and waist size    w  0     subscript  w  0    w_{0}   . The BPP of a real beam is obtained by measuring the beam's minimum diameter and far-field divergence, and taking their product. The ratio of the BPP of the real beam to that of an ideal Gaussian beam at the same wavelength is known as M 2 (" M squared "). The M 2 for a Gaussian beam is one. All real laser beams have M 2 values greater than one, although very high quality beams can have values very close to one.  The numerical aperture of a Gaussian beam is defined to be    NA  =   n   sin  θ        NA    n    θ      \mathrm{NA}=n\sin\theta   , where n is the index of refraction of the medium through which the beam propagates. This means that the Rayleigh range is related to the numerical aperture by       z  R   =    w  0   /  NA        subscript  z  normal-R      subscript  w  0   NA     z_{\mathrm{R}}=w_{0}/\mathrm{NA}     Gouy phase  The on-axis longitudinal phase delay or Gouy phase of the beam is 13        ζ   (  z  )    =   arctan   (   z   z  R    )     .        ζ  z       z   subscript  z  normal-R       \zeta(z)=\arctan\left(\frac{z}{z_{\mathrm{R}}}\right)\ .     The Gouy phase shift 14 indicates that as a Gaussian beam passes through a waist, it acquires an additional phase shift of π, in addition to the usual    e   -   i  k  z       superscript  e      i  k  z      e^{-ikz}   phase shift that would be expected from a plane wave. 15  Complex beam parameter  Information about the spot size and radius of curvature of a Gaussian beam can be encoded in the complex beam parameter,    q   (  z  )       q  z    q(z)   : 16 17        q   (  z  )    =   z  +   q  0    =   z  +   i    z  R       .          q  z     z   subscript  q  0           z    i   subscript  z  normal-R        q(z)=z+q_{0}=z+iz_{\mathrm{R}}\ .     The reciprocal     1  /  q    (  z  )         1  q   z    1/q(z)   shows the relationship between    q   (  z  )       q  z    q(z)   ,    w   (  z  )       w  z    w(z)   , and    R   (  z  )       R  z    R(z)   explicitly: 18        1   q   (  z  )     =   1   z  +   i   z  R      =    z    z  2   +   z  R  2     -   i    z  R     z  2   +   z  R  2       =    1   R   (  z  )     -   i   λ   π   w  2    (  z  )        .          1    q  z      1    z    i   subscript  z  normal-R               z     superscript  z  2    superscript   subscript  z  normal-R   2       i     subscript  z  normal-R      superscript  z  2    superscript   subscript  z  normal-R   2                1    R  z      i    λ    π   superscript  w  2   z         {1\over q(z)}={1\over z+iz_{\mathrm{R}}}={z\over z^{2}+z_{\mathrm{R}}^{2}}-i{z%

 ^{2}(z)}.     The complex beam parameter plays a key role in the analysis of Gaussian beam propagation, and especially in the analysis of optical resonator cavities using ray transfer matrices .  The amplitude, u , of a potentially elliptical or astigmatic beam can be written as the product        u   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    =   u   (  x  ,  z  )   u   (  y  ,  z  )     ,        u   x  y  z      u   x  z   u   y  z      {u}(x,y,z)={u}(x,z)\,{u}(y,z),     where       u   (  x  ,  z  )    =    1     q  x    (  z  )       exp   (   -   i  k    x  2    2   q  x    (  z  )       )           u   x  z        1       subscript  q  x   z           i  k     superscript  x  2     2   subscript  q  x   z          {u}(x,z)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{{q}_{x}(z)}}\exp\left(-ik\frac{x^{2}}{2{q}_{x}(z)}\right)   ,       u   (  y  ,  z  )    =    1     q  y    (  z  )       exp   (   -   i  k    y  2    2   q  y    (  z  )       )           u   y  z        1       subscript  q  y   z           i  k     superscript  y  2     2   subscript  q  y   z          {u}(y,z)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{{q}_{y}(z)}}\exp\left(-ik\frac{y^{2}}{2{q}_{y}(z)}\right)   , and       q  x    (  z  )        subscript  q  x   z    q_{x}(z)   and     q  y    (  z  )        subscript  q  y   z    q_{y}(z)   are the complex beam parameters for the x and y directions.  For the common case of circular symmetry ,     q  x   =   q  y   =  q         subscript  q  x    subscript  q  y        q     {q}_{x}={q}_{y}={q}   and      x  2   +   y  2    =   r  2          superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2     superscript  r  2     x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}   , which yields 19        u   (  r  ,  z  )    =    1   q   (  z  )      exp   (   -   i  k    r  2    2  q   (  z  )       )      .        u   r  z        1    q  z          i  k     superscript  r  2     2  q  z          {u}(r,z)=\frac{1}{{q}(z)}\exp\left(-ik\frac{r^{2}}{2{q}(z)}\right).

For a circle of radius    r  =   w   (  z  )        r    w  z     r=w(z)\,   , the fraction of power transmitted through the circle is        P   (  z  )     P  0    =   1  -   e   -  2     ≈  0.865 .

Similarly, about 90 percent of the beam's power will flow through a circle of radius    r  =    1.07  ⋅  w    (  z  )        r     normal-⋅  1.07  w   z     r=1.07\cdot w(z)   , 95 percent through a circle of radius    r  =    1.224  ⋅  w    (  z  )        r     normal-⋅  1.224  w   z     r=1.224\cdot w(z)   , and 99 percent through a circle of radius    r  =    1.52  ⋅  w    (  z  )        r     normal-⋅  1.52  w   z     r=1.52\cdot w(z)   . 21  Peak and average intensity  The peak intensity at an axial distance   z   z   z   from the beam waist is calculated using L'Hôpital's rule as the limit of the enclosed power within a circle of radius   r   r   r   , divided by the area of the circle    π   r  2       π   superscript  r  2     \pi r^{2}   :        I   (  0  ,  z  )    =    lim   r  →  0       P  0    [   1  -   e   -     2   r  2    /   w  2     (  z  )       ]     π   r  2      =     P  0   π     lim   r  →  0      [   -    (   -  2   )    (   2  r   )    e   -     2   r  2    /   w  2     (  z  )        ]     w  2    (  z  )    (   2  r   )       =    2   P  0     π   w  2    (  z  )      .

The peak intensity is thus exactly twice the average intensity , obtained by dividing the total power by the area within the radius    w   (  z  )       w  z    w(z)   .  Derivation  The Gaussian beam formalism begins with the wave equation for an electromagnetic field in free space or in a homogeneous dielectric medium: 22         ∇  2   U   =    1   c  2       ∂  2   U    ∂   t  2       ,        superscript  normal-∇  2   U       1   superscript  c  2        superscript   2   U      superscript  t  2        \nabla^{2}U=\frac{1}{c^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}U}{\partial t^{2}},   where   U   U   U   may stand for any one of the six field components    E  x     subscript  E  x    E_{x}   ,    E  y     subscript  E  y    E_{y}   ,    E  z     subscript  E  z    E_{z}   ,    B  x     subscript  B  x    B_{x}   ,    B  y     subscript  B  y    B_{y}   , or    B  z     subscript  B  z    B_{z}   . The Gaussian beam formalism proceeds by writing down a solution of the form 23        U   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  ,  t  )    =   u   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    e   -   i   (    k  z   -   ω  t    )        ,        U   x  y  z  t      u   x  y  z    superscript  e      i      k  z     ω  t          U(x,y,z,t)=u(x,y,z)e^{-i(kz-\omega t)},   where it is assumed that the beam is sufficiently collimated along the   z   z   z   axis that      ∂  2   u   /   ∂   z  2          superscript   2   u      superscript  z  2      \partial^{2}u/\partial z^{2}   may be neglected. Substituting this solution into the wave equation above yields the paraxial approximation to the wave equation: 24           ∂  2   u    ∂   x  2     +     ∂  2   u    ∂   y  2      =   2  i  k    ∂  u    ∂  z      .            superscript   2   u      superscript  x  2         superscript   2   u      superscript  y  2        2  i  k      u     z       \frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial y^{2}}=2ik%
 \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}.     Solving this differential equation yields an infinite set of functions, of which the Gaussian beam is the lowest-order solution or mode .  Higher-order modes  Gaussian beams are just one possible solution to the paraxial wave equation. Various other sets of orthogonal solutions are used for modelling laser beams. In the general case, if a complete basis set of solutions is chosen, any real laser beam can be described as a superposition of solutions from this set. The design of the laser determines which basis set of solutions is most useful. In some cases the output of a laser may closely approximate a single higher-order mode. Hermite-Gaussian modes are particularly common, since many laser systems have Cartesian reflection symmetry in the plane perpendicular to the beam's propagation direction.  Hermite-Gaussian modes  Hermite-Gaussian modes are a convenient description for the output of lasers whose cavity design is not radially symmetric, but rather has a distinction between horizontal and vertical. In terms of the previously defined complex   q   q   q   parameter, the amplitude distribution in the   x   x   x   -plane is proportional to        u  n    (  x  ,  z  )    =     (   2  π   )    1  /  4      (   1    2  n    n  !    w  0     )    1  /  2      (    q  0    q   (  z  )     )    1  /  2      [     q  0    q  0  ∗       q  ∗    (  z  )     q   (  z  )      ]    n  /  2     H  n    (     2   x    w   (  z  )     )    exp   [   -   i    k   x  2     2  q   (  z  )       ]            subscript  u  n    x  z       superscript    2  π     1  4     superscript    1     superscript  2  n     n    subscript  w  0       1  2     superscript     subscript  q  0     q  z      1  2     superscript   delimited-[]       subscript  q  0    superscript   subscript  q  0   normal-∗         superscript  q  normal-∗   z     q  z        n  2     subscript  H  n         2   x     w  z          i      k   superscript  x  2      2  q  z          {u}_{n}(x,z)=\left(\frac{2}{\pi}\right)^{1/4}\left(\frac{1}{2^{n}n!w_{0}}%

For the case    n  =  0      n  0    n=0   the equation yields a Gaussian transverse distribution.  For two-dimensional rectangular coordinates one constructs a function      u   m  n     (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    =    u  m    (  x  ,  z  )    u  n    (  y  ,  z  )           subscript  u    m  n     x  y  z       subscript  u  m    x  z    subscript  u  n    y  z      {u}_{mn}(x,y,z)=u_{m}(x,z)u_{n}(y,z)   , where     u  n    (  y  ,  z  )        subscript  u  n    y  z     u_{n}(y,z)   has the same form as     u  m    (  x  ,  z  )        subscript  u  m    x  z     u_{m}(x,z)   . Mathematically this property is due to the separation of variables applied to the paraxial Helmholtz equation for Cartesian coordinates . 25  Hermite-Gaussian modes are typically designated "TEM mn ", where m and n are the polynomial indices in the x and y directions. A Gaussian beam is thus TEM 00 .  The Gouy phase of a TEM mn mode is stronger than that of the TEM 00 mode by a factor 1 + n + m . 26 The off-axis phase shift is different. 27  Laguerre-Gaussian modes  thumb|right|upright=1.5|The intensity profiles of twelve Laguerre-Gaussian modes If the problem is cylindrically symmetric, the natural solutions of the paraxial wave equation are Laguerre-Gaussian modes. 28 They are written in cylindrical coordinates using Laguerre polynomials        u   (  r  ,  ϕ  ,  z  )    =     C   l  p    L  G     w   (  z  )       (    r   2     w   (  z  )     )    |  l  |     exp   (   -    r  2     w  2    (  z  )      )     L  p   |  l  |     (    2   r  2      w  2    (  z  )     )    exp   (   -   i  k    r  2    2  R   (  z  )       )     exp   (   i  l  ϕ   )     exp   [   i   (    2  p   +   |  l  |   +  1   )   ζ   (  z  )    ]      ,        u   r  ϕ  z         subscript   superscript  C    L  G      l  p      w  z     superscript      r    2      w  z      l           superscript  r  2      superscript  w  2   z       superscript   subscript  L  p     l        2   superscript  r  2       superscript  w  2   z          i  k     superscript  r  2     2  R  z           i  l  ϕ        i      2  p     l   1   ζ  z       {u}(r,\phi,z)=\frac{C^{LG}_{lp}}{w(z)}\left(\frac{r\sqrt{2}}{w(z)}\right)^{|l|%

Ince-Gaussian modes  In elliptic coordinates , one can write the higher-order modes using Ince polynomials .

The Hermite-Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes are a special case of the Ince-Gaussian modes for    ε  =  ∞      ε     \varepsilon=\infty   and    ε  =  0      ε  0    \varepsilon=0   respectively.  Hypergeometric-Gaussian modes  There is another important class of paraxial wave modes in polar coordinates in which the complex amplitude is proportional to a confluent hypergeometric function .  These modes have a singular phase profile and are eigenfunctions of the photon orbital angular momentum . The intensity profile is characterized by a single brilliant ring with a singularity at its center, where the field amplitude vanishes. The amplitude is written in terms of the dimensionless radial coordinate    ρ  =   r  /   w  0        ρ    r   subscript  w  0      \rho=r/w_{0}   and the dimensionless longitudinal coordinate     \Zeta   =   z  /   z  R        \Zeta    z   subscript  z  R      \Zeta=z/z_{R}   . 31         u   p  m     (  ρ  ,  θ  ;   \Zeta   )    =      2   p  +   |  m  |   +  1     π  Γ   (   p  +   |  m  |   +  1   )         Γ   (   1  +   |  m  |   +   p  2    )     Γ   (    |  m  |   +  1   )       i    |  m  |   +  1      \Zeta    p  2      (    \Zeta   +  i   )    -   (   1  +   |  m  |   +   p  2    )      ρ   |  m  |     e   -    i   ρ  2     (    \Zeta   +  i   )       e   i  m  ϕ     F  1    1     (   -   p  2    ,    |  m  |   +  1   ;    r  2     \Zeta    (    \Zeta   +  i   )     )     ,         subscript  u    p  m     ρ  θ  \Zeta           superscript  2    p    m   1      π  normal-Γ    p    m   1          normal-Γ    1    m     p  2       normal-Γ      m   1      superscript  i      m   1     superscript  \Zeta    p  2     superscript    \Zeta  i       1    m     p  2       superscript  ρ    m     superscript  e        i   superscript  ρ  2      \Zeta  i       superscript  e    i  m  ϕ     subscript   subscript  F  1   1        p  2        m   1      superscript  r  2     \Zeta    \Zeta  i         u_{pm}(\rho,\theta;\Zeta)=\sqrt{\frac{2^{p+|m|+1}}{\pi\Gamma(p+|m|+1)}}\frac{%

Some subfamilies of hypergeometric-Gaussian (HyGG) modes can be listed as the modified Bessel-Gaussian modes, the modified exponential Gaussian modes, and the modified Laguerre–Gaussian modes.  The set of hypergeometric-Gaussian modes is overcomplete and is not an orthogonal set of modes. In spite of its complicated field profile, HyGG modes have a very simple profile at the pupil plane (     \Zeta   =  0      \Zeta  0    \Zeta=0   ):        u   (  ρ  ,  ϕ  ,  0  )    ∝    ρ   p  +   |  m  |      e    -   ρ  2    +   i  m  ϕ       .     proportional-to    u   ρ  ϕ  0       superscript  ρ    p    m      superscript  e       superscript  ρ  2      i  m  ϕ        u(\rho,\phi,0)\propto\rho^{p+|m|}e^{-\rho^{2}+im\phi}.     See Optical vortex , which explains that the outcoming wave from a pitch-fork hologram is a sub-family of HyGG modes.
