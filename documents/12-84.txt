P-adic order

In number theory, for a given prime number

 
 , the 

 
 -adic order or 

 
 -adic additive valuation of a non-zero integer 
 
 
 
  is the highest exponent ν such that 
 
 
ν divides

 
 . The 
 
 
 
 -adic valuation of 
 
 
 
  is defined to be 
 
 
 
 . It is commonly abbreviated ν

(
 
 
 
 ). If 
 
 
 
  is a rational number in lowest terms, so that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are relatively prime, then ν

(
 
 
 
 ) is equal to ν

(
 
 
 
 ) if 
 
 
 
  divides 
 
 
 
 , or -ν

(
 
 
 
 ) if 
 
 
 
  divides 
 
 
 
 , or to 0 if it divides neither one. The most important application of the p-adic order is in constructing the field of p-adic numbers. It is also applied toward various more elementary topics, such as the distinction between singly and doubly even numbers.1 
Definition and Properties
Integers
Let  be a prime in Z. The -adic order or -adic valuation for Z is defined as2





Rational Numbers
The -adic order can be extended into the rational numbers. We can define3





Some properties are:





 
  Moreover, if 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 

where 
 
 
 
  is the Infimum (i.e. the smaller of the two)
p-adic Norm
From our definition of the -adic order, we can define the -adic norm. The -adic norm of Q is defined as 
 
 




Some properties of the -adic norm:



A metric space can be formed on the set Q with a (non-archimedean, translation invariant) metric defined by
