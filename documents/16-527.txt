   Deligne–Mumford stack      Deligne–Mumford stack   In algebraic geometry, a Deligne–Mumford stack is a stack  F such that   (i) the diagonal    F  →   F   ×  S   F      normal-→  F    subscript   S   F  F     F\to F\times_{S}F   is representable (the base change to a scheme is a scheme), quasi-compact and separated.  (ii) There is a scheme U and étale surjective map U → F (called the atlas).   If the "étale" is weakened to " smooth ", then such a stack is called an Artin stack . An algebraic space is Deligne–Mumford.  An important fact about a Deligne–Mumford stack F is that any X in    F   (  B  )       F  B    F(B)   , B quasi-compact, has only finitely many automorphisms.  A Deligne–Mumford stack admits a presentation by a groupoid; see groupoid scheme .  References     "  Category:Algebraic geometry
