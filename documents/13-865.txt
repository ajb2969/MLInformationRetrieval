   Octave (electronics)      Octave (electronics)   In electronics , an octave is a doubling or halving of a frequency . The term is derived from the Western musical scale (an octave is a doubling in frequency) and is therefore common in audio electronics. (The prefix octa- , denoting eight, refers to the eight notes of a diatonic scale .) Along with the decade , it is a unit used to describe frequency bands or frequency ratios . 1 2  A frequency ratio expressed in octaves is the base-2 logarithm ( binary logarithm ) of the ratio:      octaves  =    log  2    (    f  2    f  1    )        octaves    subscript   2      subscript  f  2    subscript  f  1       \mathrm{octaves}=\log_{2}\left(\frac{f_{2}}{f_{1}}\right)     An amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of ±6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by ±6 decibels (a factor of 4 in power), when the frequency changes by a factor of 2. This slope, or more precisely     10    log  10    (  4  )     ≈  6.0206        10    subscript   10   4    6.0206    10\log_{10}(4)\approx 6.0206   decibels per octave, corresponds to an amplitude gain proportional to frequency, which is equivalent to ±20dB per decade (factor of 10 amplitude gain change for a factor of 10 frequency change). This would be a first-order filter .  Example  1. The distance between the frequencies 20 Hz and 40 Hz is 1 octave.  2. An amplitude of 52 dB at 4 kHz decreases as frequency increases at −2 dB/octave. What is the amplitude at 13 kHz?      number of octaves  =    log  2    (   13  4   )    =  1.7        number of octaves    subscript   2     13  4         1.7     \text{number of octaves}=\log_{2}\left(\frac{13}{4}\right)=1.7          Mag   13  kHz    =  52  dB  +   (  1.7  octaves  ×  -  2  dB/octave  )   =  48.6  dB  .     fragments   subscript  Mag    13  kHz     52  dB    fragments  normal-(  1.7  octaves    2  dB/octave  normal-)    48.6  dB  normal-.    \text{Mag}_{13\text{ kHz}}=52\text{ dB}+(1.7\text{ octaves}\times-2\text{ dB/%
