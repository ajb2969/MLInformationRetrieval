It is called paracompact because it has infinite cells . Each cell consists of a hexagonal tiling whose vertices lie on a horosphere : a flat plane in hyperbolic space that approaches a single ideal point at infinity.  The Schläfli symbol of the order-4 hexagonal tiling honeycomb is {6,3,4}. Since that of the hexagonal tiling of the plane is {6,3}, this honeycomb has four such hexagonal tilings meeting at each edge. Since the Schläfli symbol of the octahedron is {3,4}, the vertex figure of this honeycomb is an octahedron. Thus, 8 hexagonal tilings meet at each vertex of this honeycomb, and the six edges meeting at each vertex lie along three orthogonal axes. 1  Images      Perspective projection     The vertices of a t{(3,∞,3)} ,  tiling exists as a 2- hypercycle within this honeycomb     {{-}}  Symmetry  It has three reflective simplex symmetry construction. The uniform construction {6,3 1,1 } has two types (colors) of hexagonal tilings in the Wythoff construction .  ↔  A quarter symmetry construction can have four colors of hexagonal tilings: .  An additional two reflective symmetries exist with nonsimplex fundamental domains: Coxeter notation : [6,3 * ,4], index 6, , and [6,(3,4) * ], index 48, with a cube fundamental domain, and octahedral Coxeter diagram with three axial infinite branches: . It can be seen with 8 colors of hexagonal tilings.  This honeycomb contains  that tile 2- hypercycle surfaces, similar to this paracompact tilings, :      {{-}}  Related polytopes and honeycombs  It is one of 15 regular hyperbolic honeycombs in 3-space, 11 of which like this one are paracompact, with infinite cells or vertex figures.  There are fifteen uniform honeycombs in the [6,3,4] Coxeter group family, including this regular form, and its dual , the order-6 cubic honeycomb , {4,3,6}.  It has a related alternation honeycomb, represented by  ↔ , having triangular tiling and octahedron cells.  It is a part of sequence of regular honeycombs with hexagonal tiling cells of the form {6,3,p}:  This honeycomb is also related to the 16-cell , cubic honeycomb and order-4 dodecahedral honeycomb all which have octahedral vertex figures.
