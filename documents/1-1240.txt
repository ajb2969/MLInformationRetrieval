Adder–subtractor

In digital circuits, an adder–subtractor is a circuit that is capable of adding or subtracting numbers (in particular, binary). Below is a circuit that does adding or subtracting'' depending on a control signal. It is also possible to construct a circuit that performs both addition and subtraction at the same time.
Construction

A 4-bit ripple-carry adder–subtractor based on a 4-bit adder that performs two's complement on 
 
 
 
  when 
 
 
 
  to yield 
 
 


Having an n-bit adder for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 . Then, assume the numbers are in two's complement. Then to perform 
 
 
 
 , two's complement theory says to invert each bit with a NOT gate then add one. This yields 
 
 
 
 , which is easy to do with a slightly modified adder.
By preceding each 
 
 
 
  input bit on the adder with a 2-to-1 multiplexer where:

Input 0 (
 
 
 
 ) is straight through (
 
 
 
 )
Input 1 (
 
 
 
 ) is negated (
 
 
 
 )

that has control input 
 
 
 
  and the initial carry connect is also connected to 
 
 
 
  then:

When 
 
 
 
  the modified adder performs addition
When 
 
 
 
  the modified adder performs subtraction

This works because when 
 
 
 
  the 
 
 
 
  input to the adder is really 
 
 
 
  and the carry in is 
 
 
 
 . Adding 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  yields the desired subtraction of 
 
 
 
 .
A way you can mark number 
 
 
 
  as positive or negative without using a multiplexer on each bit is to use a XOR (Exclusive OR) gate to precede each bit instead.

First input to the XOR gate is the actual input bit
Second input to the XOR gate for each is the Control input 
 
 


This produces the same Truth table for the bit arriving at the adder as the multiplexer solution does. As when 
 
 
 
  the XOR Gate output will be what the input bit is set to. and when 
 
 
 
  it will effectively invert the input bit
Role in the arithmetic logic unit
Adders are a part of the core of an arithmetic logic unit (ALU). The control unit decides which operations an ALU should perform (based on the op code being executed) and sets the ALU operation. The 
 
 
 
  input to the adder–subtractor above would be one such control line from the control unit.
The adder–subtractor above could easily be extended to include more functions. For example, a 2-to-1 multiplexer could be introduced on each 
 
 
 
  that would switch between zero and 
 
 
 
 ; this could be used (in conjunction with 
 
 
 
 ) to yield the two's complement of 
 
 
 
  since 
 
 
 
 .
A further step would be to change the 2-to-1 mux on 
 
 
 
  to a 4-to-1 with the third input being zero, then replicating this on 
 
 
 
  thus yielding the following output functions:



 
  (with the both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  input set to zero and 
 
 
 
 )


 
  (with the both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  input set to zero and 
 
 
 
 )


 
  (with the 
 
 
 
  input set to zero)


 
  (with the 
 
 
 
  input set to zero)


 
  (with the 
 
 
 
  input set to zero and 
 
 
 
 )


 
  (with the 
 
 
 
  input set to zero and 
 
 
 
 )











 
  (with 
 
 
 
  set to invert; 
 
 
 
  set to zero; and 
 
 
 
 )


 
  (with 
 
 
 
  set to invert; 
 
 
 
  set to zero; and 
 
 
 
 )


 
  (with 
 
 
 
  set to invert; 
 
 
 
  set to zero; and 
 
 
 
 )


 
  (with 
 
 
 
  set to invert; 
 
 
 
  set to zero; and 
 
 
 
 )

By adding more logic in front of the adder, a single adder can be converted into much more than just an adder—an ALU.
