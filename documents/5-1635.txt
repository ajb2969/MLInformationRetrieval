   Canonical ring      Canonical ring   In mathematics , the pluricanonical ring of an algebraic variety  V (which is non-singular ), or of a complex manifold , is the graded ring       R   (  V  ,  K  )    =   R   (  V  ,   K  V   )          R   V  K      R   V   subscript  K  V       R(V,K)=R(V,K_{V})\,     of sections of powers of the canonical bundle  K . Its n th graded component (for    n  ‚â•  0      n  0    n\geq 0   ) is:        R  n   :=    H  0    (  V  ,   K  n   )     ,     assign   subscript  R  n      superscript  H  0    V   superscript  K  n       R_{n}:=H^{0}(V,K^{n}),     that is, the space of sections of the n -th tensor product  K n of the canonical bundle  K .  The 0th graded component    R  0     subscript  R  0    R_{0}   is sections of the trivial bundle, and is one-dimensional as V is projective. The projective variety defined by this graded ring is called the canonical model of V , and the dimension of the canonical model , is called the Kodaira dimension of V .  One can define an analogous ring for any line bundle  L over V ; the analogous dimension is called the Iitaka dimension . A line bundle is called big if the Iitaka dimension equals the dimension of the variety.  Properties  Birational invariance  The canonical ring and therefore likewise the Kodaira dimension is a birational invariant : Any birational map between smooth compact complex manifolds induces an isomorphism between the respective canonical rings. As a consequence one can define the Kodaira dimension of a singular space as the Kodaira dimension of a desingularization . Due to the birational invariance this is well defined, i.e., independent of the choice of the desingularization.  Fundamental conjecture of birational geometry  A basic conjecture is that the pluricanonical ring is finitely generated . This is considered a major step in the Mori program .  and  have announced proofs of this conjecture.  The plurigenera  The dimension       P  n   =    h  0    (  V  ,   K  n   )    =    dim   H  0     (  V  ,   K  n   )           subscript  P  n      superscript  h  0    V   superscript  K  n             dim   superscript  H  0     V   superscript  K  n        P_{n}=h^{0}(V,K^{n})=\operatorname{dim}\ H^{0}(V,K^{n})     is the classically-defined n -th plurigenus of V . The pluricanonical divisor    K  n     superscript  K  n    K^{n}   , via the corresponding linear system of divisors , gives a map to projective space     ùêè   (    H  0    (  V  ,   K  n   )    )    =   ùêè    P  n   -  1          ùêè     superscript  H  0    V   superscript  K  n       superscript  ùêè     subscript  P  n   1      \mathbf{P}(H^{0}(V,K^{n}))=\mathbf{P}^{P_{n}-1}   , called the n -canonical map.  The size of R is a basic invariant of V , and is called the Kodaira dimension .
