   Finite-dimensional von Neumann algebra      Finite-dimensional von Neumann algebra   In mathematics, von Neumann algebras are self-adjoint operator algebras that are closed under a chosen operator topology . When the underlying Hilbert space is finite-dimensional, the von Neumann algebra is said to be a finite-dimensional von Neumann algebra . The finite-dimensional case differs from the general von Neumann algebras in that topology plays no role and they can be characterized using Wedderburn 's theory of semisimple algebras .  Details  Let C n × n be the n × n matrices with complex entries. A von Neumann algebra  M is a self adjoint subalgebra in C n × n such that M contains the identity operator I in C n × n .  Every such M as defined above is a semisimple algebra , i.e. it contains no nilpotent ideals. Suppose M ≠ 0 lies in a nilpotent ideal of M . Since M* ∈ M by assumption, we have M*M , a positive semidefinite matrix, lies in that nilpotent ideal. This implies ( M*M ) k = 0 for some k . So M*M = 0, i.e. M = 0.  The center of a von Neumann algebra M will be denoted by Z ( M ). Since M is self-adjoint, Z ( M ) is itself a (commutative) von Neumann algebra. A von Neumann algebra N is called a factor if Z ( N ) is one-dimensional, that is, Z ( N ) consists of multiples of the identity I .  Theorem Every finite-dimensional von Neumann algebra M is a direct sum of m factors, where m is the dimension of Z ( M ).  Proof: By Wedderburn's theory of semisimple algebras, Z ( M ) contains a finite orthogonal set of idempotents (projections) { P i } such that P i P j = 0 for i ≠ j , Σ P i = I , and       Z   (  𝐌  )    =    ⊕  i    Z   (  𝐌  )    P  i           Z  𝐌     subscript  direct-sum  i     Z  𝐌   subscript  P  i       Z(\mathbf{M})=\oplus_{i}Z(\mathbf{M})P_{i}     where each Z ( M )P i is a commutative simple algebra. Every complex simple algebras is isomorphic to the full matrix algebra C k × k for some k . But Z ( M )P i is commutative, therefore one-dimensional.  The projections P i "diagonalizes" M in a natural way. For M ∈ M , M can be uniquely decomposed into M = Σ MP i . Therefore,       𝐌  =    ⊕  i    𝐌   P  i      .      𝐌    subscript  direct-sum  i     𝐌   subscript  P  i       {\mathbf{M}}=\oplus_{i}{\mathbf{M}}P_{i}.     One can see that Z ( M P i ) = Z ( M )P i . So Z ( M P i ) is one-dimensional and each M P i is a factor. This proves the claim.  For general von Neumann algebras, the direct sum is replaced by the direct integral . The above is a special case of the central decomposition of von Neumann algebras .  "  Category:Linear algebra  *
