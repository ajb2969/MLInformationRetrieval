   Excitation temperature      Excitation temperature   The Excitation Temperature (    T  ex     subscript  T  ex    T_{\rm ex}   ) is defined for a population of particles via the Boltzmann factor . It satisfies         n  u    n  l    =     g  u    g  l     exp   (   -    Δ  E    k   T  ex      )      ,         subscript  n  normal-u    subscript  n  normal-l         subscript  g  normal-u    subscript  g  normal-l            normal-Δ  E     k   subscript  T  ex          \frac{n_{\rm u}}{n_{\rm l}}=\frac{g_{\rm u}}{g_{\rm l}}\exp{(-\frac{\Delta E}{%
 kT_{\rm ex}})},     where n u and n l represent the number of particles in an upper ( e.g. excited) and lower ( e.g. ground) state, and g u and g l their statistical weights respectively.  Thus the excitation temperature is the temperature at which we would expect to find a system with this ratio of level populations. However it has no actual physical meaning except when in local thermodynamical equilibrium. The excitation temperature can even be negative for a system with inverted levels (such as a maser ).  In observations of the 21 cm line , the apparent value of the excitation temperature is often called the "spin temperature". 1  References  "  Category:Temperature     ↩
