   Hydrostatic weighing      Hydrostatic weighing   Hydrostatic weighing , also referred to as "underwater weighing," "hydrostatic body composition analysis," and "hydrodensitometry," is a technique for measuring the mass per unit volume of a patient's body.  Method  The following method has the advantage of needing no volume information of the body (see the note about the residual volume below). The procedure is based on Archimedes' principle , using the following three measurable values: The weight of the body outside the water, the weight of the completely immersed body (a weight that may be negative if the body in question is less dense than water) and the density of the water:       density of body  density of water   =    weight of body   weight of body  -  weight of immersed body           density of body  density of water     weight of body    weight of body  weight of immersed body      \frac{\mbox{density of body}}{\mbox{density of water}}=\frac{\mbox{weight of %
 body}}{\mbox{weight of body}-\mbox{weight of immersed body}}\,   Multiplying by the density of water gives      density of body  =   density of water    weight of body   weight of body  -  weight of immersed body          density of body    density of water    weight of body    weight of body  weight of immersed body       \mbox{density of body}=\mbox{density of water}\frac{\mbox{weight of body}}{%
 \mbox{weight of body}-\mbox{weight of immersed body}}\,   . Correcting for the residual volume of air in the lungs upon maximal exhalation, and the approximately 100 ml of air trapped in the intestines gives:      density of body  =     density of water  *  weight of body     (   weight of body  -  weight of immersed body   )   -   density of water  *   (   residual lung volume  +  100 ml   )           density of body      density of water  weight of body       weight of body  weight of immersed body     density of water    residual lung volume  100 ml        \mbox{density of body}=\frac{\mbox{density of water}*\mbox{weight of body}}{(%
 \mbox{weight of body}-\mbox{weight of immersed body})-\mbox{density of water}*%
 (\mbox{residual lung volume}+\mbox{100 ml})}\,   . Residual lung volume can be estimated as a proportion of vital capacity (0.24 for men and 0.28 for women). 1  Application  From this density information body composition and percentage body fat may be estimated. This is occasionally used for assessment of obesity . The residual volume in the lungs can add error if not measured directly. Hydrostatic weights gives body density, and percent body fat can be estimated using the Siri 2 or Brozek 3 formula.
