16S rRNA (guanine1207-N2)-methyltransferase

16S rRNA (guanine1207-N2)-methyltransferase (, m2G1207 methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (guanine1207-N2)-methyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine1207 in 16S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N2-methylguanine1207 in 16S rRNA
 

The enzyme reacts well with 30S subunits reconstituted from 16S RNA transcripts and 30S proteins but is almost inactive with the corresponding free RNA.
