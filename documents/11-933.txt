Hydrogen-sulfide S-acetyltransferase




Hydrogen-sulfide S-acetyltransferase

In enzymology, a hydrogen-sulfide S-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acetyl-CoA + hydrogen sulfide 
 
 
 
  CoA + thioacetate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and hydrogen sulfide, whereas its two products are CoA and thioacetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:hydrogen-sulfide S-acetyltransferase. This enzyme is also called hydrogen-sulfide acetyltransferase.
