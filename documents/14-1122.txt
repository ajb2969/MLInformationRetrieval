Belevitch's theorem

Belevitch's theorem is a theorem in electrical network analysis due to the Russo-Belgian mathematician Vitold Belevitch (1921–1999). The theorem provides a test for a given S-matrix to determine whether or not it can be constructed as a lossless rational two-port network.
Lossless implies that the network contains only inductances and capacitances - no resistances. Rational (meaning the driving point impedance Z(p) is a rational function of p) implies that the network consists solely of discrete elements (inductors and capacitors only - no distributed elements).

where,
 
p is the complex frequency variable and may be replaced by 
 
 
 
 
  in the case of steady state sine wave signals, that is, where only a Fourier analysis is required
 
d will equate to the number of elements (inductors and capacitors) in the network, if such network exists.
 

Belevitch's theorem states that, 
 
 
 
  represents a lossless rational network if and only if,1
