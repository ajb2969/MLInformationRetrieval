   Belevitch's theorem      Belevitch's theorem   Belevitch's theorem is a theorem in electrical network analysis due to the Russo-Belgian mathematician Vitold Belevitch (1921–1999). The theorem provides a test for a given S-matrix to determine whether or not it can be constructed as a lossless rational two-port network .  Lossless implies that the network contains only inductances and capacitances - no resistances . Rational (meaning the driving point impedance  Z ( p ) is a rational function of p ) implies that the network consists solely of discrete elements ( inductors and capacitors only - no distributed elements ).  The theorem  For a given S-matrix    𝐒   (  p  )       𝐒  p    \mathbf{S}(p)   of degree    d   d   d   ;       𝐒   (  p  )    =   [      s  11      s  12        s  21      s  22      ]         𝐒  p      subscript  s  11    subscript  s  12      subscript  s  21    subscript  s  22       \mathbf{S}(p)=\begin{bmatrix}s_{11}&s_{12}\\
 s_{21}&s_{22}\end{bmatrix}      where,  p is the complex frequency variable and may be replaced by    i  ω      i  ω    i\omega   in the case of steady state sine wave signals, that is, where only a Fourier analysis is required  d will equate to the number of elements (inductors and capacitors) in the network, if such network exists.   Belevitch's theorem states that,    𝐒   (  p  )       𝐒  p    \scriptstyle\mathbf{S}(p)   represents a lossless rational network if and only if, 1       𝐒   (  p  )    =    1   g   (  p  )      [      h   (  p  )       f   (  p  )         ±   f   (   -  p   )        ∓   h   (   -  p   )        ]          𝐒  p       1    g  p        h  p     f  p      plus-or-minus    f    p      minus-or-plus    h    p          \mathbf{S}(p)=\frac{1}{g(p)}\begin{bmatrix}h(p)&f(p)\\
