   No-wandering-domain theorem      No-wandering-domain theorem   In mathematics , the no-wandering-domain theorem is a result on dynamical systems , proven by Dennis Sullivan in 1985.  The theorem states that a rational map  f : Ĉ → Ĉ with deg( f ) ≥ 2 does not have a wandering domain , where Ĉ denotes the Riemann sphere . More precisely, for every component  U in the Fatou set of f , the sequence      U  ,   f   (  U  )    ,   f   (   f   (  U  )    )    ,  …  ,    f  n    (  U  )    ,  …     U    f  U     f    f  U    normal-…     superscript  f  n   U   normal-…    U,f(U),f(f(U)),\dots,f^{n}(U),\dots     will eventually become periodic. Here, f  n denotes the n -fold iteration of f , that is,        f  n   =     f  ∘  f  ∘  ⋯  ∘  f   ⏟   n    .       superscript  f  n    subscript   normal-⏟    f  f  normal-⋯  f    n     f^{n}=\underbrace{f\circ f\circ\cdots\circ f}_{n}.     (Figure)  This image illustrates the dynamics of     f   (  z  )    =   z  +   2  π   sin   (  z  )            f  z     z    2  π    z       f(z)=z+2\pi\sin(z)   ; the Fatou set (consisting entirely of wandering domains) is shown in white, while the Julia set is shown in tones of gray.   The theorem does not hold for arbitrary maps; for example, the transcendental map      f   (  z  )    =   z  +   2  π   sin   (  z  )            f  z     z    2  π    z       f(z)=z+2\pi\sin(z)   has wandering domains. However, the result can be generalized to many situations where the functions naturally belong to a finite-dimensional parameter space, most notably to transcendental entire and meromorphic functions with a finite number of singular values.
