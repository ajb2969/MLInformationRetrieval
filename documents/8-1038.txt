Equivalence (measure theory)

In mathematics, and specifically in measure theory, equivalence is a notion of two measures being qualitatively similar. Specifically, the two measures agree on which events have probability zero.
Definition
Let (X, Σ) be a measurable space, and let μ, ν : Σ → R be two signed measures. Then μ is said to be equivalent to ν if and only if each is absolutely continuous with respect to the other. In symbols:



Thus, any event A is a null event with respect to μ, if and only if it is a null event with respect to ν


Equivalence of measures is an equivalence relation on the set of all measures Σ → R.
Examples

Gaussian measure and Lebesgue measure on the real line are equivalent to one another.
Lebesgue measure and Dirac measure on the real line are inequivalent.
