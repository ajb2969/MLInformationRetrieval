   Equivalence (measure theory)      Equivalence (measure theory)   In mathematics , and specifically in measure theory , equivalence is a notion of two measures being qualitatively similar. Specifically, the two measures agree on which events have probability zero.  Definition  Let ( X , Σ) be a measurable space , and let μ , ν : Σ → R be two signed measures . Then μ is said to be equivalent to ν  if and only if each is absolutely continuous with respect to the other. In symbols:        μ  ∼  ν   ⇔   μ  ≪  ν  ≪  μ    .     iff   similar-to  μ  ν      much-less-than  μ  ν    much-less-than    μ      \mu\sim\nu\iff\mu\ll\nu\ll\mu.     Thus, any event A is a null event with respect to μ , if and only if it is a null event with respect to ν       μ   (  A  )    =  0   ⇔    ν   (  A  )    =  0      iff      μ  A   0       ν  A   0     \mu(A)=0\iff\nu(A)=0     Equivalence of measures is an equivalence relation on the set of all measures Σ → R .  Examples   Gaussian measure and Lebesgue measure on the real line are equivalent to one another.  Lebesgue measure and Dirac measure on the real line are inequivalent.
