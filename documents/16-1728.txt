Quantum mechanical scattering of photon and nucleus

In pair production, a photon creates an electron positron pair. In the process of photons scattering in air (e.g. in lightning discharges), the most important interaction is the scattering of photons at the nuclei of atoms or molecules. The full quantum mechanical process of pair production can be described by the quadruply differential cross section give here:1


with



This expression can be derived by using a quantum mechanical symmetry between pair production and Bremsstrahlung.

 
  is the atomic number, 
 
 
 
  the fine structure constant, 
 
 
 
  the reduced Planck's constant and 
 
 
 
  the speed of light. The kinetic energies 
 
 
 
 
  of the positron and electron relate to their total energies 
 
 
 
  and momenta

Conservation of energy yields



The momentum 
 
 
 
 
  of the virtual photon between incident photon and nucleus is:



where the directions are given via:

  is the momentum of the incident photon.
In order to analyse the relation between the photon energy 
 
 
 
  and the emission angle 
 
 
 
  between photon and positron, Köhn and Ebert integrated 2 the quadruply differential cross section over

 . The double differential cross section is:



with



and



This cross section can be applied in Monte Carlo simulations. An analysis of this expression shows that positrons are mainly emitted in the direction of the incident photon.
