17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone aldolase

In enzymology, a 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone 
 
 
 
  4-androstene-3,17-dione + acetaldehyde
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and two products, 4-androstene-3,17-dione and acetaldehyde.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone acetaldehyde-lyase (4-androstene-3,17-dione-forming). Other names in common use include C-17/C-20 lyase, and 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone acetaldehyde-lyase. This enzyme participates in androgen and estrogen metabolism.
