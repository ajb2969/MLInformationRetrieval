   GTP cyclohydrolase II      GTP cyclohydrolase II   In enzymology , a GTP cyclohydrolase II () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GTP + 3 H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   formate + 2,5-diamino-6-hydroxy-4-(5-phosphoribosylamino)pyrimidine + diphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GTP and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are formate , 2,5-diamino-6-hydroxy-4-(5-phosphoribosylamino)pyrimidine , and diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GTP 7,8-8,9-dihydrolase (diphosphate-forming) . Other names in common use include guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase II , and GTP-8-formylhydrolase . This enzyme participates in riboflavin metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
