   Generalized entropy index      Generalized entropy index  The '''generalized entropy index''' has been proposed as a measure of [[income inequality]] in a population. {{c ite journal|last1=Shorrocks|first1=A.

In information theory a measure of redundancy can be interpreted as non-randomness or data compression ; thus this interpretation also applies to this index. In additional interpretation of the index is as biodiversity as entropy has also been proposed as a measure of diversity. 1  Formula  The formula for general entropy for real values of   α   α   \alpha   is:       G  E   (  α  )    =   {         1   N  α   (   α  -  1   )         ∑   i  =  1   N     [     (     y  i    y  ¯     )   α   -  1   ]     ,       α  ≠   0  ,  1    ,           1  N       ∑   i  =  1   N        y  i    y  ¯      ln     y  i    y  ¯         ,       α  =  1   ,         -     1  N       ∑   i  =  1   N     ln     y  i    y  ¯         ,      α  =  0.             G  E  α    cases      1    N  α    α  1       superscript   subscript     i  1    N    delimited-[]     superscript     subscript  y  i    normal-¯  y    α   1        α   0  1        1  N     superscript   subscript     i  1    N        subscript  y  i    normal-¯  y         subscript  y  i    normal-¯  y          α  1         1  N     superscript   subscript     i  1    N        subscript  y  i    normal-¯  y          α  0.      GE(\alpha)=\begin{cases}\frac{1}{N\alpha(\alpha-1)}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left[\left(%
 \frac{y_{i}}{\overline{y}}\right)^{\alpha}-1\right],&\alpha\neq 0,1,\\
 \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{y_{i}}{\overline{y}}\ln\frac{y_{i}}{\overline{y%
 }},&\alpha=1,\\
 -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\ln\frac{y_{i}}{\overline{y}},&\alpha=0.\end{cases}     where N is the number of cases (e.g., households or families),    y  i     subscript  y  i    y_{i}   is the income for case i and   α   α   \alpha   is the weight given to distances between incomes at different parts of the income distribution.  A feature of the generalized entropy index is that it can be transformed into a subclass of the Atkinson index when assuming that    ϵ  =   1  -  α       ϵ    1  α     \epsilon=1-\alpha   and that the social welfare function is the natural logarithm. The transformation is    A  =   1  -   e   -   G  E          A    1   superscript  e      G  E        A=1-e^{-GE}   . Moreover, it is the unique class of inequality measures that has the properties of the Atkinson index and which also is additive decomposable. Many popular indices, including Gini index , do not satisfy additive decomposability. 2  Note that the generalized entropy index has several inequality statistics as special cases. For example, GE(0) is the mean log deviation , GE(1) is the Theil index , and GE(2) is half the coefficient of variation .
