   Keratan sulfotransferase      Keratan sulfotransferase   In enzymology , a keratan sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + keratan   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + keratan 6'-sulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and keratan , whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and keratan 6'-sulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:keratan 6'-sulfotransferase . Other names in common use include 3'-phosphoadenylyl keratan sulfotransferase , keratan sulfate sulfotransferase , and 3'-phosphoadenylylsulfate:keratan sulfotransferase .
