   4-carboxy-2-hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase      4-carboxy-2-hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 4-carboxy-2-hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-carboxy-2-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconate 6-semialdehyde + NADP + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-carboxy-2-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconate + NADPH + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 4-carboxy-2-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconate 6-semialdehyde , NADP + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are 4-carboxy-2-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-carboxy-2-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconate-6-semialdehyde:NADP+ 6-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 2-hydroxy-4-carboxymuconate 6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase , 2-hydroxy-4-carboxymuconate 6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase , 4-carboxy-2-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconate-6-semialdehyde:NADP+ , oxidoreductase , alpha-hydroxy-gamma-carboxymuconic epsilon-semialdehyde , and dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism and benzoate degradation via hydroxylation .
