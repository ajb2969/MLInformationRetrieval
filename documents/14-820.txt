   Jørgensen's inequality      Jørgensen's inequality   In the mathematical theory of Kleinian groups , Jørgensen's inequality is an inequality involving the traces of elements of a Kleinian group , proved by .  The inequality states that if A and B generate a non-elementary discrete subgroup of SL 2 ( C ), then        |    Tr    (  A  )   2    -  4   |   +   |    Tr   (   A  B   A   -  1     B   -  1     )    -  2   |    ≥   1.
