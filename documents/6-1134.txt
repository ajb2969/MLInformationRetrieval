   Fredholm kernel      Fredholm kernel   In mathematics , a Fredholm kernel is a certain type of a kernel on a Banach space , associated with nuclear operators on the Banach space. They are an abstraction of the idea of the Fredholm integral equation and the Fredholm operator , and are one of the objects of study in Fredholm theory . Fredholm kernels are named in honour of Erik Ivar Fredholm . Much of the abstract theory of Fredholm kernels was developed by Alexander Grothendieck and published in 1955.  Definition  Let B be an arbitrary Banach space , and let B * be its dual, that is, the space of bounded linear functionals on B . The tensor product      B  *   ⊗  B     tensor-product   superscript  B    B    B^{*}\otimes B   has a completion under the norm        ∥  X  ∥   π   =   inf    ∑   {  i  }      ∥   e  i  *   ∥    ∥   e  i   ∥           subscript   norm  X   π    infimum    subscript    i       norm   subscript   superscript  e    i     norm   subscript  e  i         \|X\|_{\pi}=\inf\sum_{\{i\}}\|e^{*}_{i}\|\|e_{i}\|     where the infimum is taken over all finite representations      X  =    ∑   {  i  }      e  i  *   ⊗   e  i     ∈    B  *   ⊗  B         X    subscript    i     tensor-product   subscript   superscript  e    i    subscript  e  i           tensor-product   superscript  B    B      X=\sum_{\{i\}}e^{*}_{i}\otimes e_{i}\in B^{*}\otimes B     The completion, under this norm, is often denoted as       B  *     ⊗  ^   π   B       superscript  B     subscript   normal-^  tensor-product   π   B    B^{*}\widehat{\,\otimes\,}_{\pi}B     and is called the projective topological tensor product . The elements of this space are called Fredholm kernels .  Properties  Every Fredholm kernel has a representation in the form      X  =    ∑   {  i  }       λ  i    e  i  *    ⊗   e  i         X    subscript    i     tensor-product     subscript  λ  i    subscript   superscript  e    i     subscript  e  i       X=\sum_{\{i\}}\lambda_{i}e^{*}_{i}\otimes e_{i}     with     e  i   ∈  B       subscript  e  i   B    e_{i}\in B   and     e  i  *   ∈   B  *        subscript   superscript  e    i    superscript  B      e^{*}_{i}\in B^{*}   such that     ∥   e  i   ∥   =   ∥   e  i  *   ∥   =  1         norm   subscript  e  i     norm   subscript   superscript  e    i         1     \|e_{i}\|=\|e^{*}_{i}\|=1   and         ∑   {  i  }     |   λ  i   |    <  ∞   .        subscript    i       subscript  λ  i        \sum_{\{i\}}|\lambda_{i}|<\infty.\,     Associated with each such kernel is a linear operator       ℒ  X   :   B  →  B      normal-:   subscript  ℒ  X    normal-→  B  B     \mathcal{L}_{X}:B\to B     which has the canonical representation         ℒ  X   f   =    ∑   {  i  }      λ  i    e  i  *    (  f  )    e  i      .         subscript  ℒ  X   f     subscript    i       subscript  λ  i    subscript   superscript  e    i   f   subscript  e  i       \mathcal{L}_{X}f=\sum_{\{i\}}\lambda_{i}e^{*}_{i}(f)e_{i}.\,     Associated with every Fredholm kernel is a trace, defined as        tr  X   =    ∑   {  i  }      λ  i    e  i  *    (   e  i   )      .        tr  X     subscript    i       subscript  λ  i    subscript   superscript  e    i    subscript  e  i       \mbox{tr}X=\sum_{\{i\}}\lambda_{i}e^{*}_{i}(e_{i}).\,     p -summable kernels  A Fredholm kernel is said to be ''' p -summable''' if        ∑   {  i  }      |   λ  i   |   p    <  ∞        subscript    i     superscript     subscript  λ  i    p       \sum_{\{i\}}|\lambda_{i}|^{p}<\infty     A Fredholm kernel is said to be of order q if q is the infimum of all    X  ∈    B  *     ⊗  ^   π   B       X     superscript  B     subscript   normal-^  tensor-product   π   B     X\in B^{*}\widehat{\,\otimes\,}_{\pi}B   is said to be a nuclear operator if there exists an    ℒ  =   ℒ  X       ℒ   subscript  ℒ  X     \mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_{X}   such that    q  ≤   2  /  3       q    2  3     q\leq 2/3   . Such an operator is said to be p -summable and of order q if X is. In general, there may be more than one X associated with such a nuclear operator, and so the trace is not uniquely defined. However, if the order    ℒ  :   B  →  B      normal-:  ℒ   normal-→  B  B     \mathcal{L}:B\to B   , then there is a unique trace, as given by a theorem of Grothendieck.  Grothendieck's theorem  If    q  ≤   2  /  3       q    2  3     q\leq 2/3   is an operator of order     Tr  ℒ   =    ∑   {  i  }     ρ  i          Tr  ℒ     subscript    i     subscript  ρ  i      \mbox{Tr}\mathcal{L}=\sum_{\{i\}}\rho_{i}   then a trace may be defined, with      ρ  i     subscript  ρ  i    \rho_{i}     where   ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   are the eigenvalues of     det   (   1  -   z  ℒ    )    =    ∏  i    (   1  -    ρ  i   z    )            1    z  ℒ       subscript  product  i     1     subscript  ρ  i   z       \det\left(1-z\mathcal{L}\right)=\prod_{i}\left(1-\rho_{i}z\right)   . Furthermore, the Fredholm determinant       det   (   1  -   z  ℒ    )    =   exp   Tr   log   (   1  -   z  ℒ    )              1    z  ℒ         Tr      1    z  ℒ         \det\left(1-z\mathcal{L}\right)=\exp\mbox{Tr}\log\left(1-z\mathcal{L}\right)     is an entire function of z . The formula     ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}     holds as well. Finally, if    ℒ  =   ℒ  w       ℒ   subscript  ℒ  w     \mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_{w}   is parameterized by some complex -valued parameter w , that is,    det   (   1  -   z   ℒ  w     )         1    z   subscript  ℒ  w       \det\left(1-z\mathcal{L}_{w}\right)   , and the parameterization is holomorphic on some domain, then      D  ⊂   ℂ  k       D   superscript  ℂ  k     D\subset\mathbb{C}^{k}     is holomorphic on the same domain.  Examples  An important example is the Banach space of holomorphic functions over a domain $D\subset \mathbb{C}^k$ . In this space, every nuclear operator is of order zero, and is thus of trace-class .  Nuclear spaces  The idea of a nuclear operator can be adapted to Fréchet spaces . A nuclear space is a Fréchet space where every bounded map of the space to an arbitrary Banach space is nuclear.
