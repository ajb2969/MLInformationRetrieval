  is true for sufficiently large 
 
 
 
  which is actually shorthand for:


 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is true 
 
 
 
 . This does not necessarily mean that any particular value for 
 
 
 
  is known, but only that such an 
 
 
 
  exists. The phrase "sufficiently large" should not be confused with the phrases "arbitrarily large" or "infinitely large".
