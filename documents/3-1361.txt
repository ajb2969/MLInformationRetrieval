   Sufficiently large      Sufficiently large   In mathematics , the phrase sufficiently large is used in such contexts as:     P   P   P   is true for sufficiently large   x   x   x   which is actually shorthand for:       ∃  a   ∈  ℝ        a   ℝ    \exists~{}a\in\mathbb{R}   such that   P   P   P   is true     ∀  x   ≥  a       for-all  x   a    \forall~{}x\geq a   . This does not necessarily mean that any particular value for   a   a   a   is known, but only that such an   a   a   a   exists. The phrase "sufficiently large" should not be confused with the phrases " arbitrarily large " or " infinitely large".
