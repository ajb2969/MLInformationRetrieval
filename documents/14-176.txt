Retkes identities

In mathematics, the Retkes Identities, named after Zoltán Retkes, are one of the most efficient applications of the Retkes inequality, when 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . In this special setting, one can have for the iterated integrals



The notation is explained at Hermite–Hadamard inequality.
Particular cases
Since 
 
 
 
  is strictly convex if 
 
 
 
 , strictly concave if 
 
 
 
 , linear if 
 
 
 
 , the following inequalities and identities hold:




















Consequences
One of the consequences of the case 
 
 
 
  is the Retkes convergence criterion because of the right side of the equality is precisely the nth partial sum of 
 
 

Assume henceforth that 
 
 
 
  Under this condition substituting 
 
 
 
  instead of 
 
 
 
  in the second and fourth identities one can have two universal algebraic identities. These four identities are the so-called Retkes identities:
