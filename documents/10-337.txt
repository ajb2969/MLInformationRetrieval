Statistically close

The  variation distance of two distributions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  over a finite domain 
 
 
 
 , (often referred to as statistical difference 1 or statistical distance2 in cryptography) is defined as


 
 .
We say that two probability ensembles

 
  and 
 
 
 
  are statistically close if 
 
 
 
  is a negligible function in 
 
 
 
 .
