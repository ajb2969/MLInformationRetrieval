   Statistically close      Statistically close   The variation distance of two distributions   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   over a finite domain   D   D   D   , (often referred to as statistical difference  1 or statistical distance 2 in cryptography) is defined as       Δ   (  X  ,  Y  )    =    1  2     ∑   α  ∈  D     |    Pr   [   X  =  α   ]    -   Pr   [   Y  =  α   ]     |           normal-Δ   X  Y        1  2     subscript     α  D         Pr    X  α     Pr    Y  α          \Delta(X,Y)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\alpha\in D}|\Pr[X=\alpha]-\Pr[Y=\alpha]|   .  We say that two probability ensembles      {   X  k   }    k  ∈  𝒩      subscript    subscript  X  k      k  𝒩     \{X_{k}\}_{k\in\mathcal{N}}   and     {   Y  k   }    k  ∈  𝒩      subscript    subscript  Y  k      k  𝒩     \{Y_{k}\}_{k\in\mathcal{N}}   are statistically close if    Δ   (   X  k   ,   Y  k   )       normal-Δ    subscript  X  k    subscript  Y  k      \Delta(X_{k},Y_{k})   is a negligible function in   k   k   k   .
