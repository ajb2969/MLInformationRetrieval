   Homogeneous differential equation      Homogeneous differential equation   The term homogeneous is used in more than one context in mathematics. Perhaps the most prominent are the following three distinct cases:   Homogeneous functions  Homogeneous type of first order differential equations  Homogeneous differential equations (in contrast to "inhomogeneous" differential equations). This definition is used to define a property of certain linear differential equations—it is unrelated to the above two cases.   Each one of these cases will be briefly explained as follows.  Homogeneous functions  Definition . A function $f(x)$ is said to be homogeneous of degree $n$ if, by introducing a constant parameter $\lambda$ , replacing the variable $x$ with $\lambda  x$ we find:  $$f(\lambda x) = \lambda^n f(x)\,.$$  This definition can be generalized to functions of more-than-one variables; for example, a function of two variables $f(x,y)$ is said to be homogeneous of degree $n$ if we replace both variables $x$ and $y$ by $\lambda x$ and $\lambda y$ ,  we find:  $$f(\lambda x, \lambda y) = \lambda^n f(x,y)\,.$$  Example. The function $f(x,y) = (2x^2-3y^2+4xy)$ is a homogeneous function of degree 2 because:  $$f(\lambda x, \lambda y) = [2(\lambda x)^2-3(\lambda y)^2+4(\lambda x \lambda y)] = (2\lambda^2x^2-3\lambda^2y^2+4\lambda^2 xy) = \lambda^2(2x^2-3y^2+4xy)=\lambda^2f(x,y).$$ This definition of homogeneous functions has been used to classify certain types of first order differential equations.  Homogeneous type of first-order differential equations  A first-order ordinary differential equation in the form:  $$M(x,y)\,dx + N(x,y)\,dy = 0$$  is a homogeneous type if both functions M ( x, y ) and N ( x, y ) are homogeneous functions of the same degree n . 1 That is, multiplying each variable by a parameter $\lambda$ , we find:  $$M(\lambda x, \lambda y) = \lambda^n M(x,y)\,.$$  and  $N(\lambda x, \lambda y) = \lambda^n N(x,y)\,.$  Thus,  $$\frac{M(\lambda x, \lambda y)}{N(\lambda x, \lambda y)} = \frac{M(x,y)}{N(x,y)}\,.$$  Solution method  In the quotient $\frac{M(tx,ty)}{N(tx,ty)} = \frac{M(x,y)}{N(x,y)}$ , we can let $t = 1/x$ to simplify this quotient to a function $f$ of the single variable $y/x$ :  $$\frac{M(x,y)}{N(x,y)} = \frac{M(tx,ty)}{N(tx,ty)} = \frac{M(1,y/x)}{N(1,y/x)}=f(y/x)\,.$$  Introduce the change of variables  $y=ux$ ; differentiate using the product rule :  $$\frac{d(ux)}{dx} = x\frac{du}{dx} + u\frac{dx}{dx} = x\frac{du}{dx} + u,$$  thus transforming the original differential equation into the separable form:  $$x\frac{du}{dx} = f(u) - u\,;$$ this form can now be integrated directly (see ordinary differential equation ).  The equations in this discussion are not to be used as formulary for solutions; they are shown just to demonstrate the method of solution.  Special case  A first order differential equation of the form ( a , b , c , e , f , g are all constants):  $$(ax + by + c) dx + (ex + fy + g) dy = 0\, ,$$  can be transformed into a homogeneous type by a linear transformation of both variables ( $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants):  $$t = x + \alpha; \,\,\,\, z = y + \beta \,.$$  Homogeneous linear differential equations  Definition. A linear differential equation is called homogeneous if the following condition is satisfied: If $\phi(x)$ is a solution, so is $c \phi(x)$ , where $c$ is an arbitrary (non-zero) constant. Note that in order for this condition to hold, each term in a linear differential equation of the dependent variable y must contain y or any derivative of y. A linear differential equation that fails this condition is called inhomogeneous.  A linear differential equation can be represented as a linear operator acting on y(x) where x is usually the independent variable and y is the dependent variable. Therefore, the general form of a linear homogeneous differential equation is of the form:  $$L(y) = 0 \,$$  $$ where L is a differential operator , a sum of derivatives (defining the "0th derivative" as the original, non-differentiated function), each multiplied by a function $f_i$ of x :  $$L = \sum_{i=0}^n f_i(x)\frac{d^i}{dx^i} \,;$$ where $f_i$ may be constants, but not all $f_i$ may be zero.  For example, the following differential equation is homogeneous  $$\sin(x) \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 4 \frac{dy}{dx} + y = 0 \,,$$  whereas the following two are inhomogeneous:  $$2 x^2 \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 4 x \frac{dy}{dx} + y = \cos(x) \,;$$  $$2 x^2 \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - 3 x \frac{dy}{dx} + y = 2 \,.$$ Note: the existence of a constant term is enough for this equation to be inhomogeneous.
