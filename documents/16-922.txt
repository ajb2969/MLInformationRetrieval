Mean log deviation

In statistics and econometrics, the mean log deviation (MLD) is a measure of income inequality. The MLD is zero when everyone has the same income, and takes on larger positive values as incomes become more unequal, especially at the high end.
Definition
The MLD of household income has been defined as1



where N is the number of households, 
 
 
 
  is the income of household i, and 
 
 
 
  is the mean of 
 
 
 
 . Naturally the same formula can be used for positive variables other than income and for units of observation other than households.
Equivalent definitions are



where 
 
 
 
  is the mean of ln(x). The last definition shows that MLD is nonnegative, since 
 
 
 
  by Jensen's inequality.
MLD has been called "the standard deviation of ln(x)",2 but this is not correct. The standard deviation of ln(x) would be



E.g., for the standard lognormal distribution, MLD = 1/2 but SDL = 1.

The MLD is a special case of the generalized entropy index. Specifically, the MLD is the generalized entropy index with α=0.
