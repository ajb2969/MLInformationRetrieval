   Mean log deviation      Mean log deviation   In statistics and econometrics , the mean log deviation (MLD) is a measure of income inequality . The MLD is zero when everyone has the same income, and takes on larger positive values as incomes become more unequal, especially at the high end.  Definition  The MLD of household income has been defined as 1      MLD  =    1  N     ∑   i  =  1   N    ln    x  ¯    x  i           MLD      1  N     superscript   subscript     i  1    N        normal-¯  x    subscript  x  i         \mathrm{MLD}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\ln\frac{\overline{x}}{x_{i}}     where N is the number of households,    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   is the income of household i , and    x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \overline{x}   is the mean of    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   . Naturally the same formula can be used for positive variables other than income and for units of observation other than households.  Equivalent definitions are      MLD  =    1  N     ∑   i  =  1   N    (    ln   x  ¯    -   ln   x  i     )     =    ln   x  ¯    -    ln  x   ¯          MLD      1  N     superscript   subscript     i  1    N        normal-¯  x       subscript  x  i                 normal-¯  x     normal-¯    x        \mathrm{MLD}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\ln\overline{x}-\ln x_{i})=\ln\overline%
 {x}-\overline{\ln x}     where     ln  x   ¯     normal-¯    x     \overline{\ln x}   is the mean of ln( x ). The last definition shows that MLD is nonnegative, since     ln   x  ¯    ≥    ln  x   ¯          normal-¯  x     normal-¯    x      \ln{\overline{x}}\geq\overline{\ln x}   by Jensen's inequality .  MLD has been called "the standard deviation of ln( x )", 2 but this is not correct. The standard deviation of ln( x ) would be      SDL  =     1  N     ∑   i  =  1   N     (    ln   x  i    -    ln  x   ¯    )   2          SDL        1  N     superscript   subscript     i  1    N    superscript       subscript  x  i     normal-¯    x     2        \mathrm{SDL}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\ln x_{i}-\overline{\ln x})^{2}}     E.g., for the standard lognormal distribution , MLD = 1/2 but SDL = 1.  Related statistics  The MLD is a special case of the generalized entropy index . Specifically, the MLD is the generalized entropy index with α=0.
