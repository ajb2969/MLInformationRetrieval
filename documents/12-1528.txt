   Gompertz distribution      Gompertz distribution   In probability and statistics , the Gompertz distribution is a continuous probability distribution . The Gompertz distribution is often applied to describe the distribution of adult lifespans by demographers 1 2 and actuaries . 3 4 Related fields of science such as biology 5 and gerontology 6 also considered the Gompertz distribution for the analysis of survival. More recently, computer scientists have also started to model the failure rates of computer codes by the Gompertz distribution. 7 In Marketing Science, it has been used as an individual-level simulation for customer lifetime value modeling. 8 In an independent effort, early users in the 1990s for the Gompertz distribution in CLV models included Edge Consulting and BrandScience  Specification  Probability density function  The probability density function of the Gompertz distribution is:        f   (  x  ;  η  ,  b  )    =   b  η   e   b  x     e  η    exp   (   -   η   e   b  x      )    for  x   ≥  0   ,          f   x  η  b      b  η   superscript  e    b  x     superscript  e  η         η   superscript  e    b  x       for  x        0     f\left(x;\eta,b\right)=b\eta e^{bx}e^{\eta}\exp\left(-\eta e^{bx}\right)\text{%
 for }x\geq 0,\,     where    b  >  0      b  0    b>0\,\!   is the scale parameter and    η  >  0      η  0    \eta>0\,\!   is the shape parameter of the Gompertz distribution. In the actuarial and biological sciences and in demography, the Gompertz distribution is parametrized slightly differently ( Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality ).  Cumulative distribution function  The cumulative distribution function of the Gompertz distribution is:        F   (  x  ;  η  ,  b  )    =   1  -   exp   (   -   η   (    e   b  x    -  1   )     )      ,        F   x  η  b      1        η     superscript  e    b  x    1         F\left(x;\eta,b\right)=1-\exp\left(-\eta\left(e^{bx}-1\right)\right),   where      η  ,  b   >  0   ,       η  b   0    \eta,b>0,   and    x  ≥  0 .      x  0 .    x\geq 0\,.     Moment generating function  The moment generating function is:       E   (   e   -   t  X     )    =   η   e  η    E   t  /  b     (  η  )          E   superscript  e      t  X        η   superscript  e  η    subscript  E    t  b    η     \text{E}\left(e^{-tX}\right)=\eta e^{\eta}\text{E}_{t/b}\left(\eta\right)   where         E   t  /  b     (  η  )    =    ∫  1   \infin      e   -   η  v      v   -   t  /  b     d  v     ,   t  >  0.      formulae-sequence       subscript  E    t  b    η     superscript   subscript   1   \infin      superscript  e      η  v      superscript  v      t  b     d  v       t  0.     \text{E}_{t/b}\left(\eta\right)=\int_{1}^{\infin}e^{-\eta v}v^{-t/b}dv,\ t>0.     Properties  The Gompertz distribution is a flexible distribution that can be skewed to the right and to the left.  Shapes  The Gompertz density function can take on different shapes depending on the values of the shape parameter   η   η   \eta\,\!   :   When     η  ≥  1   ,      η  1    \eta\geq 1,\,   the probability density function has its mode at 0.  When     0  <  η  <  1   ,        0  η       1     0<\eta<1,\,   the probability density function has its mode at          x  *   =    (   1  /  b   )    ln   (   1  /  η   )    with  0   <   F   (   x  *   )    <   1  -   e   -  1     =  0.632121         superscript  x        1  b       1  η    with  0          F   superscript  x            1   superscript  e    1          0.632121     x^{*}=\left(1/b\right)\ln\left(1/\eta\right)\text{with }0        Kullback-Leibler divergence  If    f  1     subscript  f  1    f_{1}   and    f  2     subscript  f  2    f_{2}   are the probability density functions of two Gompertz distributions, then their Kullback-Leibler divergence is given by       D   K  L     (   f  1   ∥   f  2   )      fragments   subscript  D    K  L     fragments  normal-(   subscript  f  1   parallel-to   subscript  f  2   normal-)     \displaystyle D_{KL}(f_{1}\parallel f_{2})   where    Ei   (  ⋅  )      Ei  normal-⋅    \operatorname{Ei}(\cdot)   denotes the exponential integral and    Γ   (  ⋅  ,  ⋅  )       normal-Γ   normal-⋅  normal-⋅     \Gamma(\cdot,\cdot)   is the upper incomplete gamma function . 9  Related distributions   If X is defined to be the result of sampling from a Gumbel distribution until a negative value Y is produced, and setting X =− Y , then X has a Gompertz distribution.  The gamma distribution is a natural conjugate prior to a Gompertz likelihood with known scale parameter    b  .    b   b\,\!.    10  When   η   η   \eta\,\!   varies according to a gamma distribution with shape parameter   α   α   \alpha\,\!   and scale parameter   β   β   \beta\,\!   (mean =    α  /  β      α  β    \alpha/\beta\,\!   ), the distribution of   x   x   x   is Gamma/Gompertz. 11   See also   Gompertz function  Customer lifetime value  Gamma Gompertz distribution   Notes  References        "  Category:Continuous distributions  Category:Probability distributions             Bauckhage, C.
