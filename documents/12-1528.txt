Gompertz distribution

In probability and statistics, the Gompertz distribution is a continuous probability distribution. The Gompertz distribution is often applied to describe the distribution of adult lifespans by demographers12 and actuaries.34 Related fields of science such as biology5 and gerontology6 also considered the Gompertz distribution for the analysis of survival. More recently, computer scientists have also started to model the failure rates of computer codes by the Gompertz distribution.7 In Marketing Science, it has been used as an individual-level simulation for customer lifetime value modeling.8 In an independent effort, early users in the 1990s for the Gompertz distribution in CLV models included Edge Consulting and BrandScience
Specification
Probability density function
The probability density function of the Gompertz distribution is:



where 
 
 
 
  is the scale parameter and 
 
 
 
  is the shape parameter of the Gompertz distribution. In the actuarial and biological sciences and in demography, the Gompertz distribution is parametrized slightly differently (Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality).
Cumulative distribution function
The cumulative distribution function of the Gompertz distribution is:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

Moment generating function
The moment generating function is:


 
  where



Properties
The Gompertz distribution is a flexible distribution that can be skewed to the right and to the left.
Shapes
The Gompertz density function can take on different shapes depending on the values of the shape parameter 
 
 
 
 :

When 
 
 
 
  the probability density function has its mode at 0.
When 
 
 
 
  the probability density function has its mode at









Kullback-Leibler divergence
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the probability density functions of two Gompertz distributions, then their Kullback-Leibler divergence is given by


 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes the exponential integral and 
 
 
 
  is the upper incomplete gamma function.9
Related distributions

If X is defined to be the result of sampling from a Gumbel distribution until a negative value Y is produced, and setting X=−Y, then X has a Gompertz distribution.
The gamma distribution is a natural conjugate prior to a Gompertz likelihood with known scale parameter 
 
 
10
When 
 
 
 
  varies according to a gamma distribution with shape parameter 
 
 
 
  and scale parameter 
 
 
 
  (mean = 
 
 
 
 ), the distribution of 
 
 
 
  is Gamma/Gompertz.11
