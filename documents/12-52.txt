Shortcut model

An important question in statistical mechanics is the dependence of model behaviour on the dimension of the system. The shortcut model12 was introduced in the course of studying this dependence. The model interpolates between discrete regular lattices of integer dimension.
Introduction
The behaviour of different processes on discrete regular lattices have been studied quite extensively. They show a rich diversity of behaviour, including a non-trivial dependence on the dimension of the regular lattice.34567891011 In recent years the study has been extended from regular lattices to complex networks. The shortcut model has been used in studying several processes and their dependence on dimension.
Dimension of complex network
Usually, dimension is defined based on the scaling exponent of some property in the appropriate limit. One property one could use 12 is the scaling of volume with distance. For regular lattices 
 
 
 
  the number of nodes 
 
 
 
  within a distance 
 
 
 
  of node 
 
 
 
 
  scales as 
 
 
 
 .
For systems which arise in physical problems one usually can identify some physical space relations among the vertices. Nodes which are linked directly will have more influence on each other than nodes which are separated by several links. Thus, one could define the distance 
 
 
 
  between nodes 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as the length of the shortest path connecting the nodes.
For complex networks one can define the volume as the number of nodes 
 
 
 
 
  within a distance 
 
 
 
  of node 
 
 
 
 , averaged over 
 
 
 
 , and the dimension may be defined as the exponent which determines the scaling behaviour of the volume with distance. For a vector 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  is a positive integer, the Euclidean norm 
 
 
 
  is defined as the Euclidean distance from the origin to 
 
 
 
 , i.e.,



However, the definition which generalises to complex networks is the 
 
 
 
  norm,



The scaling properties hold for both the Euclidean norm and the 
 
 
 
  norm. The scaling relation is



where d is not necessarily an integer for complex networks. 
 
 
 
  is a geometric constant which depends on the complex network. If the scaling relation Eqn. holds, then one can also define the surface area 
 
 
 
  as the number of nodes which are exactly at a distance 
 
 
 
 
  from a given node, and 
 
 
 
  scales as



A definition based on the complex network zeta function13 generalises the definition based on the scaling property of the volume with distance14 and puts it on a mathematically robust footing.
Shortcut model
The shortcut model starts with a network built on a one-dimensional regular lattice. One then adds edges to create shortcuts that join remote parts of the lattice to one another. The starting network is a one-dimensional lattice of 
 
 
 
  vertices with periodic boundary conditions. Each vertex is joined to its neighbors on either side, which results in a system with 
 
 
 
  edges. The network is extended by taking each node in turn and, with probability 
 
 
 
 
 , adding an edge to a new location 
 
 
 
  nodes distant.
The rewiring process allows the model to interpolate between a one-dimensional regular lattice and a two-dimensional regular lattice. When the rewiring probability 
 
 
 
 , we have a one-dimensional regular lattice of size 
 
 
 
 . When 
 
 
 
 , every node is connected to a new location and the graph is essentially a two-dimensional lattice with 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  nodes in each direction. For 
 
 
 
  between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , we have a graph which interpolates between the one and two dimensional regular lattices. The graphs we study are parametrized by









Application to extensiveness of power law potential
One application using the above definition of dimension was to the extensiveness of statistical mechanics systems with a power law potential where the interaction varies with the distance 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 . In one dimension the system properties like the free energy do not behave extensively when 
 
 
 
 
 , i.e., they increase faster than N as 
 
 
 
 , where N is the number of spins in the system.
Consider the Ising model with the Hamiltonian (with N spins)



where 
 
 
 
  are the spin variables, 
 
 
 
  is the distance between node 
 
 
 
 
  and node 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are the couplings between the spins. When the 
 
 
 
  have the behaviour 
 
 
 
 , we have the power law potential. For a general complex network the condition on the exponent 
 
 
 
 
  which preserves extensivity of the Hamiltonian was studied. At zero temperature, the energy per spin is proportional to



and hence extensivity requires that 
 
 
 
  be finite. For a general complex network 
 
 
 
  is proportional to the Riemann zeta function

 
 . Thus, for the potential to be extensive, one requires



Other processes which have been studied are self-avoiding random walks, and the scaling of the mean path length with the network size. These studies lead to the interesting result that the dimension transitions sharply as the shortcut probability increases from zero.15 The sharp transition in the dimension has been explained in terms of the combinatorially large number of available paths for points separated by distances large compared to 1.16
Conclusion
The shortcut model is useful for studying the dimension dependence of different processes. The processes studied include the behaviour of the power law potential as a function of the dimension, the behaviour of self-avoiding random walks, and the scaling of the mean path length. It may be useful to compare the shortcut model with the small-world network, since the definitions have a lot of similarity. In the small-world network also one starts with a regular lattice and adds shortcuts with probability 
 
 
 
 . However, the shortcuts are not constrained to connect to a node a fixed distance ahead. Instead, the other end of the shortcut can connect to any randomly chosen node. As a result, the small world model tends to a random graph rather than a two-dimensional graph as the shortcut probability is increased.
