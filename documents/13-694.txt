   Clapeyron's theorem (elasticity)      Clapeyron's theorem (elasticity)   In the linear theory of elasticity  Clapeyron's theorem states that the potential energy of deformation of a body, which is in equilibrium under a given load, is equal to half the work done by the external forces computed assuming these forces had remained constant from the initial state to the final state. 1  It is named after the French scientist Benoît Clapeyron .  For example consider a linear spring with initial length L 0 and gradually pull on the spring until it reaches equilibrium at a length L 1 when the pulling force is F . By the theorem, the potential energy of deformation in the spring is        1  2   F   (    L  1   -   L  0    )    .        1  2   F     subscript  L  1    subscript  L  0      \frac{1}{2}F(L_{1}-L_{0}).     The actual force increased from 0 to F during the deformation; the work done can be computed by integration in distance. Clapeyron's equation, which uses the final force only, may be puzzling at first, but is nevertheless true because it includes a corrective factor of one half.  Another theorem, the theorem of three moments used in bridge engineering is also sometimes called Clapeyron's theorem.
