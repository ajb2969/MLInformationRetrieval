TrueAchievements

TrueAchievements is a website that tracks player's Achievements in games for the Xbox One, Xbox 360, Windows Phone, Games for Windows - Live, Windows 7 and Windows 8 platforms. It is published by TrueGaming Network, which also publishes the TrueTrophies sister website catering to PlayStation consoles. TrueAchievements uses a novel method of assessment, titled "TrueAchievement" score, in addition to Microsoft's Xbox Live Gamerscore. The site is a member of the Xbox Community Developer Program, and as of September 2013, TrueAchievements has over 184,000 registered users including the 2 highest scoring Xbox players.12 In 2014, the TrueAchievements Xbox One application was made available to allow users to access several of the site's features directly on their consoles.
Website
TrueAchievements was designed and programmed by Richard Stone, with additional design by Chris Greenhough, and launched in March 2008. It was conceptualized when Richard Stone determined that the current GamerScore system devised by Microsoft was inherently unbalanced; it would sometimes appear to offer only a few points for difficult tasks in-game, and lots of points for somewhat trivial tasks in-game. His solution was to allocate points based on rarity of the achievement - that is, how many other players already had that particular achievement. If many players had a particular achievement, it would be considered common and therefore have a lower score. If not many players had a particular achievement, it would be considered rare and given a higher score.
Currently the website is hosted by RapidSwitch on 3 leased servers at its Maidenhead Datacentre, and receives 850,000 unique visitors a month and around 20 million monthly page views.3 The majority of content, including game solutions and walkthroughs, are primarily provided by the users of the site. The site is also staffed by a number of unpaid volunteers who oversee the moderation of the user content, post news, game walkthroughs, reviews and other editorials. The website uses advertising to support its operations, as well as a paid "Pro" subscription option for users that wish to remove the advertising and gain other additional benefits.
TrueAchievement score
TrueAchievement score is obtained by taking the base Gamerscore value of an achievement and multiplying it by its rarity, resulting in a more accurate representation of skill required to obtain it.4

An example
On 27 December 2011, The game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had 47,115 tracked owners. Of those owners, 25,314 of them had earned the achievement "Explorer", which is worth 40 Gamerscore. Therefore, that achievement had, at that point in time, a TAScore of



Because the TrueAchievement score is dependent on the number of people who currently have an achievement, it can change over time,5 as more people become tracked as having the game, or more people who have the game earn this achievement.
The TrueAchievement score is displayed on user's pages, along with other pertinent information such as their Gamerscore, the number of achievements they have unlocked, their most recent achievements and played games, and other customizable information.
