   Barycenter      Barycenter     The barycenter , British spelling  barycentre , (from the Greek βαρύ-ς heavy + κέντρ-ον centre 1 ) is the center of mass of two or more bodies that are orbiting each other, or the point around which they both orbit. It is an important concept in fields such as astronomy and astrophysics . The distance from the center of a body (viewed as a point-mass) to the barycenter can be calculated as a simple two-body problem .  In cases where one of the two objects is considerably more massive than the other, the barycenter will typically be located within the more massive object. Rather than appearing to orbit a common center of mass with the smaller body, the larger will simply be seen to "wobble" slightly. This is the case for the Earth–Moon system, where the barycenter is located on average 4,671 km from Earth's center, well within the planet's radius of 6,378 km. When the two bodies are of similar masses, the barycenter will be located between them and both bodies will follow an orbit around it. This is the case for Pluto and Charon , Jupiter and the Sun , and many binary asteroids and binary stars .  In astronomy, barycentric coordinates are non-rotating coordinates with the origin at the center of mass of two or more bodies. The International Celestial Reference System is a barycentric one, based on the barycenter of the Solar System .  In geometry, the term "barycenter" is synonymous with centroid , the geometric center of a two-dimensional shape.  Two-body problem  (Figure)  Motion of the Solar System 's barycenter relative to the Sun   The barycenter is one of the foci of the elliptical orbit of each body. This is an important concept in the fields of astronomy , astrophysics . If a is the distance between the centers of the two bodies (the semi-major axis of the system), r 1 is the semi-major axis of the primary's orbit around the barycenter, and r 2 = a − r 1 is the semi-major axis of the secondary's orbit. When the barycenter is located within the more massive body, that body will appear to "wobble" rather than to follow a discernible orbit. In a simple two-body case, r 1 , the distance from the center of the primary to the barycenter is given by:       r  1   =   a  ⋅    m  2     m  1   +   m  2      =   a   1  +    m  1   /   m  2             subscript  r  1    normal-⋅  a     subscript  m  2      subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2             a    1     subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2         r_{1}=a\cdot{m_{2}\over m_{1}+m_{2}}={a\over 1+m_{1}/m_{2}}     where :   r 1 is the distance from body 1 to the barycenter  a is the distance between the centers of the two bodies  m 1 and m 2 are the masses of the two bodies.   Primary–secondary examples  The following table sets out some examples from the Solar System . Figures are given rounded to three significant figures . The last two columns show R 1 , the radius of the first (more massive) body, and r 1 / R 1 , the ratio of the distance to the barycenter and that radius: a value less than one shows that the barycenter lies inside the first body. The term primary–secondary is used to distinguish between the different degrees of relationship of the involved participants.

If m 1 ≫ m 2 — which is true for the Sun and any planet — then the ratio r 1 / R 1 approximates to:       a   R  1    ⋅    m  2    m  1       normal-⋅    a   subscript  R  1       subscript  m  2    subscript  m  1      {a\over R_{1}}\cdot{m_{2}\over m_{1}}     Hence, the barycenter of the Sun–planet system will lie outside the Sun only if:        a   R   ⊙     ⋅    m   p  l  a  n  e  t     m   ⊙      >   1   ⇒   a  ⋅   m   p  l  a  n  e  t     >    R   ⊙    ⋅   m   ⊙     ≈    2.3  ×    10  11       m   E  a  r  t  h     km   ≈    1530     m   E  a  r  t  h     AU          normal-⋅    a   subscript  R  normal-⊙       subscript  m    p  l  a  n  e  t     subscript  m  normal-⊙     1    normal-⇒     normal-⋅  a   subscript  m    p  l  a  n  e  t           normal-⋅   subscript  R  normal-⊙    subscript  m  normal-⊙             2.3   superscript  10  11     subscript  m    E  a  r  t  h    km          1530   subscript  m    E  a  r  t  h    AU      {a\over R_{\bigodot}}\cdot{m_{planet}\over m_{\bigodot}}>1\;\Rightarrow\;{a%

 _{Earth}\;\mbox{km}\approx 1530\;m_{Earth}\;\mbox{AU}     That is, where the planet is heavy and far from the Sun.  If Jupiter had Mercury 's orbit (57,900,000 km, 0.387 AU), the Sun–Jupiter barycenter would be approximately 55,000 km from the center of the Sun ( r 1 / R 1 ~ 0.08). But even if the Earth had Eris' orbit (68 AU), the Sun–Earth barycenter would still be within the Sun (just over 30,000 km from the center).  To calculate the actual motion of the Sun, you would need to sum all the influences from all the planets , comets , asteroids , etc. of the Solar System (see n -body problem ). If all the planets were aligned on the same side of the Sun, the combined center of mass would lie about 500,000 km above the Sun's surface.  The calculations above are based on the mean distance between the bodies and yield the mean value r 1 . But all celestial orbits are elliptical, and the distance between the bodies varies between the apses , depending on the eccentricity , e . Hence, the position of the barycenter varies too, and it is possible in some systems for the barycenter to be sometimes inside and sometimes outside the more massive body. This occurs where:       1   1  -  e    >    r  1    R  1    >   1   1  +  e            1    1  e       subscript  r  1    subscript  R  1           1    1  e       {1\over{1-e}}>{r_{1}\over R_{1}}>{1\over{1+e}}     Note that the Sun–Jupiter system, with e Jupiter = 0.0484, just fails to qualify: 1.05 ≯ 1.07 > 0.954.

In general relativity , problems arise because, while it is possible, within reasonable approximations, to define the barycenter, the associated coordinate system does not fully reflect the inequality of clock rates at different locations. Brumberg explains how to set up barycentric coordinates in general relativity. 2  The coordinate systems involve a world-time, i.e. a global time coordinate that could be set up by telemetry . Individual clocks of similar construction will not agree with this standard, because they are subject to differing gravitational potentials or move at various velocities, so the world-time must be slaved to some ideal clock that is assumed to be very far from the whole self-gravitating system. This time standard is called Barycentric Coordinate Time , "TCB".
