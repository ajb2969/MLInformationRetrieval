Minnaert function

The Minnaert function is a photometric function used to interpret astronomical observations 12 and remote sensing data for the Earth.3 This function expresses the radiance factor (RADF) as a function the phase angle (
 
 
 
 ) and the photometric latitude (
 
 
 
 ) and the photometric longitude (
 
 
 
 ).


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Minnaert albedo, 
 
 
 
  is an empirical parameter, 
 
 
 
  is the scattered radiance in the direction 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  is the incident radiance, and


 
  The phase angle is the angle between the light source and the observer with the object as the center.
The assumptions made are:

the surface is illuminated by a distant point source.
the surface is isotropic and flat.

Minnaert's contribution is the introduction of the parameter 
 
 
 
 , having a value between 0 and 1,4 originally for a better interpretation of observations of the Moon. In remote sensing the use of this function is referred to as Minnaert topographic correction, a necessity when interpreting images of rough terrain.
