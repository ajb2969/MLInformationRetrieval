Meissner equation

The Meissner equation is a linear ordinary differential equation that is a special case of Hill's equation with the periodic function given as a square wave.1 2 There are many ways to write the Meissner equation. One is as



or



where


 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the Heaviside function shifted to 
 
 
 
 . Another version is



The Meissner equation was first studied as a toy problem for certain resonance problems. It is also useful for understand resonance problems in evolutionary biology.
Because the time-dependence is piecewise linear, many calculations can be performed exactly, unlike for the Mathieu equation. When 
 
 
 
 , the Floquet exponents are roots of the quadratic equation



The determinant of the Floquet matrix is 1, implying that origin is a center if 
 
 
 
  and a saddle node otherwise.
