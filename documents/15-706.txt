   Meissner equation      Meissner equation   The Meissner equation is a linear ordinary differential equation that is a special case of Hill's equation with the periodic function given as a square wave. 1  2 There are many ways to write the Meissner equation. One is as          d  2   y    d   t  2     +    (    α  2   +    ω  2    sgn   cos   (  t  )       )   y    =  0             superscript  d  2   y     d   superscript  t  2          superscript  α  2      superscript  ω  2    sgn    t      y    0    \frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}+(\alpha^{2}+\omega^{2}\operatorname{sgn}\cos(t))y=0     or          d  2   y    d   t  2     +    (   1  +   r  f   (  t  ;  a  ,  b  )     )   y    =  0             superscript  d  2   y     d   superscript  t  2         1    r  f   t  a  b     y    0    \frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}+(1+rf(t;a,b))y=0     where       f   (  t  ;  a  ,  b  )    =    -  1   +   2   H  a    (   t  mod   (   a  +  b   )    )           f   t  a  b        1     2   subscript  H  a    modulo  t    a  b        f(t;a,b)=-1+2H_{a}(t\mod(a+b))   and     H  c    (  t  )        subscript  H  c   t    H_{c}(t)   is the Heaviside function shifted to   c   c   c   . Another version is          d  2   y    d   t  2     +    (   1  +   r    sin   (   ω  t   )     |   sin   (   ω  t   )    |      )   y    =  0.             superscript  d  2   y     d   superscript  t  2         1    r        ω  t          ω  t        y    0.    \frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}+\left(1+r\frac{\sin(\omega t)}{|\sin(\omega t)|}\right)y%
 =0.     The Meissner equation was first studied as a toy problem for certain resonance problems. It is also useful for understand resonance problems in evolutionary biology.  Because the time-dependence is piecewise linear, many calculations can be performed exactly, unlike for the Mathieu equation . When    a  =  b  =  1        a  b       1     a=b=1   , the Floquet exponents are roots of the quadratic equation         λ  2   -   2  λ   cosh   (   r   )     cos   (   r   )      +  1   =  0.           superscript  λ  2     2  λ      r        r      1   0.    \lambda^{2}-2\lambda\cosh(\sqrt{r})\cos(\sqrt{r})+1=0.     The determinant of the Floquet matrix is 1, implying that origin is a center if     |    cosh   (   r   )     cos   (   r   )     |   <  1              r        r      1    |\cosh(\sqrt{r})\cos(\sqrt{r})|<1   and a saddle node otherwise.
