   Prime power      Prime power   In mathematics , a prime power is a positive integer  power of a single prime number . For example: , and are prime powers, while ,  and are not. The number one is not counted as a prime power. The twenty smallest prime powers are:   2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 16 , 17 , 19 , 23 , 25 , 27 , 29 , 31 , 32 , 37 , 41 , ... .   The prime powers are those positive integers that are divisible by exactly one prime number; prime powers and related concepts are also called primary numbers, as in the primary decomposition .  Properties  Algebraic properties  Prime powers are powers of prime numbers. Every prime power (except powers of 2) has a primitive root ; thus the multiplicative group of integers modulo p n (or equivalently, the group of units of the ring  Z / p n Z ) is cyclic .  The number of elements of a finite field is always a prime power and conversely, every prime power occurs as the number of elements in some finite field (which is unique up to isomorphism ).  Combinatorial properties  A property of prime powers used frequently in analytic number theory is that the set of prime powers which are not prime is a small set in the sense that the infinite sum of their reciprocals converges , although the primes are a large set.  Divisibility properties  The totient function ( φ ) and sigma functions ( σ 0 ) and ( σ 1 ) of a prime power are calculated by the formulas:        ϕ   (   p  n   )    =    p   n  -  1    ϕ   (  p  )    =    p   n  -  1     (   p  -  1   )    =    p  n   -   p   n  -  1     =    p  n    (   1  -   1  p    )     ,          ϕ   superscript  p  n       superscript  p    n  1    ϕ  p           superscript  p    n  1      p  1            superscript  p  n    superscript  p    n  1             superscript  p  n     1    1  p        \phi(p^{n})=p^{n-1}\phi(p)=p^{n-1}(p-1)=p^{n}-p^{n-1}=p^{n}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}%

 -1}{p-1}.     All prime powers are deficient numbers . A prime power p n is an n - almost prime . It is not known whether a prime power p n can be an amicable number . If there is such a number, then p n must be greater than 10 1500 and n must be greater than 1400.  Popular media  In the 1997 film Cube , prime powers play a key role, acting as indicators of lethal dangers in a maze-like cube structure.
