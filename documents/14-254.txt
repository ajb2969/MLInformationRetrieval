Klein polyhedron

In the geometry of numbers, the Klein polyhedron, named after Felix Klein, is used to generalize the concept of continued fractions to higher dimensions.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a closed simplicial cone in Euclidean space

 
 . The Klein polyhedron of 
 
 
 
  is the convex hull of the non-zero points of 
 
 
 
 
 .
Relation to continued fractions
Suppose 
 
 
 
  is an irrational number. In 
 
 
 
 , the cones generated by 
 
 
 
  and by 
 
 
 
  give rise to two Klein polyhedra, each of which is bounded by a sequence of adjoining line segments. Define the integer length of a line segment to be one less than the size of its intersection with 
 
 
 
 
 . Then the integer lengths of the edges of these two Klein polyhedra encode the continued-fraction expansion of 
 
 
 
 , one matching the even terms and the other matching the odd terms.
Graphs associated with the Klein polyhedron
Suppose 
 
 
 
  is generated by a basis 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  (so that 
 
 
 
 
 ), and let 
 
 
 
  be the dual basis (so that 
 
 
 
 ). Write 
 
 
 
  for the line generated by the vector 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 
  for the hyperplane orthogonal to 
 
 
 
 .
Call the vector 
 
 
irrational if 
 
 
 
 ; and call the cone 
 
 
 
  irrational if all the vectors 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are irrational.
The boundary 
 
 
 
  of a Klein polyhedron is called a sail. Associated with the sail 
 
 
 
  of an irrational cone are two graphs:

the graph 
 
 
 
  whose vertices are vertices of 
 
 
 
 
 , two vertices being joined if they are endpoints of a (one-dimensional) edge of 
 
 
 
 ;
the graph 
 
 
 
  whose vertices are 
 
 
 
 -dimensional faces (chambers) of 
 
 
 
 , two chambers being joined if they share an 
 
 
 
 
 -dimensional face.

Both of these graphs are structurally related to the directed graph 
 
 
 
  whose set of vertices is 
 
 
 
 , where vertex 
 
 
 
  is joined to vertex 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 
  is of the form 
 
 
 
  where



(with 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 ) and 
 
 
 
 
  is a permutation matrix. Assuming that 
 
 
 
  has been triangulated, the vertices of each of the graphs 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  can be described in terms of the graph 
 
 
 
 :

Given any path 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , one can find a path 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  is the vector 
 
 
 
 .

  such that

 -dimensional standard simplex in 
 
 
 
 .

Generalization of Lagrange's theorem
Lagrange proved that for an irrational real number 
 
 
 
 
 , the continued-fraction expansion of 
 
 
 
  is periodic if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic irrational. Klein polyhedra allow us to generalize this result.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a totally real algebraic number field of degree 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
 
  be the 
 
 
 
  real embeddings of 
 
 
 
 . The simplicial cone 
 
 
 
  is said to be split over 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a basis for 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
 .
Given a path 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
 . The path is called periodic, with period 
 
 
 
 , if 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . The period matrix of such a path is defined to be 
 
 
 
 
 . A path in 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  associated with such a path is also said to be periodic, with the same period matrix.
The generalized Lagrange theorem states that for an irrational simplicial cone 
 
 
 
 , with generators 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  as above and with sail 
 
 
 
 , the following three conditions are equivalent:



 
  is split over some totally real algebraic number field of degree 
 
 
 
 .
For each of the 
 
 
 
  there is periodic path of vertices 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that the 
 
 
 
  asymptotically approach the line 
 
 
 
 ; and the period matrices of these paths all commute.
For each of the 
 
 
 
  there is periodic path of chambers 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that the 
 
 
 
  asymptotically approach the hyperplane 
 
 
 
 ; and the period matrices of these paths all commute.

Example
Take 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 . Then the simplicial cone 
 
 
 
  is split over 
 
 
 
 . The vertices of the sail are the points 
 
 
 
  corresponding to the even convergents 
 
 
 
  of the continued fraction for 
 
 
 
 
 . The path of vertices 
 
 
 
  in the positive quadrant starting at 
 
 
 
  and proceeding in a positive direction is 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the line segment joining 
 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . Write 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for the reflections of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  in the 
 
 
 
 -axis. Let 
 
 
 
 , so that 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 .

The paths 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are periodic (with period one) in 
 
 
 
 , with period matrices 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . We have 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 .

Generalization of approximability
A real number 
 
 
 
  is called badly approximable if 
 
 
 
  is bounded away from zero. An irrational number is badly approximable if and only if the partial quotients of its continued fraction are bounded.1 This fact admits of a generalization in terms of Klein polyhedra.
Given a simplicial cone 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , define the norm minimum of 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 .
Given vectors 
 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
 . This is the Euclidean volume of 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be the sail of an irrational simplicial cone 
 
 
 
 .

For a vertex 
 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , define 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  are primitive vectors in 
 
 
 
  generating the edges emanating from 
 
 
 
 
 .
For a vertex 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , define 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  are the extreme points of 
 
 
 
 
 .

Then 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are both bounded.
The quantities 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are called determinants. In two dimensions, with the cone generated by 
 
 
 
 , they are just the partial quotients of the continued fraction of 
 
 
 
 .
