   Inverse Faraday effect      Inverse Faraday effect   The inverse Faraday effect is the effect opposite to the Faraday effect . A static magnetization      M  →    (  0  )        normal-→  M   0    \vec{M}(0)   is induced by an external oscillating electrical field with the frequency   ω   ω   \omega   , which can be achieved with a high intensity laser pulse for example. The induced magnetization is proportional to the vector product of    E  →     normal-→  E    \vec{E}   and     E  →   *     superscript   normal-→  E      \vec{E}^{*}   :        M  →    (  0  )    ∝   [      E  →    (  ω  )    ×    E  →   *     (  ω  )    ]      proportional-to     normal-→  M   0    delimited-[]         normal-→  E   ω    superscript   normal-→  E      ω      \vec{M}(0)\propto[\vec{E}(\omega)\times\vec{E}^{*}(\omega)]     From this equation we see that the circularly polarized light with the frequency   ω   ω   \omega   should induce a magnetization along the wave vector     k  →     normal-→  k    \vec{k}   . Because    E  →     normal-→  E    \vec{E}   is in the vector product , left- and right-handed polarization waves should induce magnetization of opposite signs.  The induced magnetization is comparable to the saturated magnetization of the media.  References   R.
