Inverse Faraday effect

The inverse Faraday effect is the effect opposite to the Faraday effect. A static magnetization

 
  is induced by an external oscillating electrical field with the frequency 
 
 
 
 , which can be achieved with a high intensity laser pulse for example. The induced magnetization is proportional to the vector product of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 :



From this equation we see that the circularly polarized light with the frequency 
 
 
 
  should induce a magnetization along the wave vector

 
 . Because 
 
 
 
  is in the vector product, left- and right-handed polarization waves should induce magnetization of opposite signs.
The induced magnetization is comparable to the saturated magnetization of the media.
