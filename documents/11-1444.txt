   Beta-glucoside kinase      Beta-glucoside kinase   In enzymology , a beta-glucoside kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + cellobiose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + 6-phospho-beta-D-glucosyl-(1,4)-D-glucose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and cellobiose , whereas its two products are ADP and 6-phospho-beta-D-glucosyl-(1,4)-D-glucose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:cellobiose 6-phosphotransferase . This enzyme is also called beta-D-glucoside kinase (phosphorylating) .
