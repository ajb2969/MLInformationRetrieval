   Thymidylate synthase (FAD)      Thymidylate synthase (FAD)   In enzymology , a thymidylate synthase (FAD) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate + dUMP + FADH 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dTMP + tetrahydrofolate + FAD   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate , dUMP , and FADH2 , whereas its 3 products are dTMP , tetrahydrofolate , and FAD .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , to be specific those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate,FADH2:dUMP C-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include Thy1 , and ThyX . This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism and one carbon pool by folate .  Most organisms, including humans, use the thyA - or TYMS -encoded classic thymidylate synthase whereas some bacteria use the similar flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase (FDTS) instead. 1  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
