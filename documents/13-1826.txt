   Non-minimally coupled inflation      Non-minimally coupled inflation   Non-minimally coupled inflation is an inflationary model in which the constant which couples gravity to the inflaton field is not small. The coupling constant is usually represented by   ξ   ξ   \xi   ( Xi ), which features in the action (constructed by modifying the Einstein–Hilbert action ): 1     S  =   ∫    d  4   x    -  g     [      m  P  2   2   R   -    1  2     ∂  μ   ϕ     ∂  μ   ϕ    -   V   (  ϕ  )    -    ξ  2   R   ϕ  2     ]         S       superscript  d  4   x      g     delimited-[]         superscript   subscript  m  P   2   2   R       1  2     superscript   μ   ϕ     subscript   μ   ϕ      V  ϕ       ξ  2   R   superscript  ϕ  2          S=\int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}\left[{m_{P}^{2}\over 2}R-{1\over 2}\partial^{\mu}\phi%
 \partial_{\mu}\phi-V(\phi)-{\xi\over 2}R\phi^{2}\right]      ξ   ξ   \xi   represents the strength of the interaction between   R   R   R   and   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   , which relate to the curvature of space and the magnitude of the inflaton field respectively.
