   Decimal representation      Decimal representation    This article gives a mathematical definition. For a more accessible article see Decimal .    A decimal representation of a non-negative  real number  r is an expression in the form of a series , traditionally written as a sum      r  =    ∑   i  =  0   ∞     a  i    10  i         r    superscript   subscript     i  0         subscript  a  i    superscript  10  i       r=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{a_{i}}{10^{i}}     where a 0 is a nonnegative integer, and a 1 , a 2 , … are integers satisfying 0 ≤ a i ≤ 9, called the digits of the decimal representation. The sequence of digits specified may be finite, in which case any further digits a i are assumed to be 0. Some authors forbid decimal representations with a trailing infinite sequence of "9"s. 1 This restriction still allows a decimal representation for each non-negative real number, but additionally makes such a representation unique. The number defined by a decimal representation is often written more briefly as        r  =   a  0    .    a  1    a  2    a  3   …    .     formulae-sequence    r   subscript  a  0       subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2    subscript  a  3   normal-…     r=a_{0}.a_{1}a_{2}a_{3}\dots.\,     That is to say, a 0 is the integer part of r , not necessarily between 0 and 9, and a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , … are the digits forming the fractional part of r .  Both notations above are, by definition, the following limit of a sequence :      r  =    lim   n  →  ∞      ∑   i  =  0   n     a  i    10  i          r    subscript    normal-→  n       superscript   subscript     i  0    n      subscript  a  i    superscript  10  i        r=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{a_{i}}{10^{i}}   .  Finite decimal approximations  Any real number can be approximated to any desired degree of accuracy by rational numbers with finite decimal representations.  Assume    x  ≥  0      x  0    x\geq 0   . Then for every integer    n  ≥  1      n  1    n\geq 1   there is a finite decimal      r  n   =   a  0    .    a  1    a  2   ⋯   a  n       formulae-sequence     subscript  r  n    subscript  a  0       subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-⋯   subscript  a  n      r_{n}=a_{0}.a_{1}a_{2}\cdots a_{n}   such that        r  n   ≤  x  <    r  n   +   1   10  n      .         subscript  r  n   x          subscript  r  n     1   superscript  10  n        r_{n}\leq x     Proof :  Let     r  n   =   p   10  n         subscript  r  n     p   superscript  10  n      r_{n}=\textstyle\frac{p}{10^{n}}   , where    p  =   ⌊    10  n   x   ⌋       p       superscript  10  n   x      p=\lfloor 10^{n}x\rfloor   . Then    p  ≤    10  n   x   <   p  +  1         p     superscript  10  n   x          p  1      p\leq 10^{n}x   , and the result follows from dividing all sides by    10  n     superscript  10  n    10^{n}   . (The fact that    r  n     subscript  r  n    r_{n}   has a finite decimal representation is easily established.)  Non-uniqueness of decimal representation  Some real numbers have two infinite decimal representations. For example, the number 1 may be equally represented by 1.000... as by 0.999... (where the infinite sequences of digits 0 and 9, respectively, are represented by "..."). Conventionally, the version with zero digits is preferred; by omitting the infinite sequence of zero digits, removing any final zero digits and a possible final decimal point, a normalized finite decimal representation is obtained.  Finite decimal representations  The decimal expansion of non-negative real number x will end in zeros (or in nines) if, and only if, x is a rational number whose denominator is of the form 2 n 5 m , where m and n are non-negative integers.  Proof :  If the decimal expansion of x will end in zeros, or    x  =    ∑   i  =  0   n     a  i    10  i     =    ∑   i  =  0   n      10   n  -  i     a  i    /   10  n           x    superscript   subscript     i  0    n      subscript  a  i    superscript  10  i            superscript   subscript     i  0    n        superscript  10    n  i     subscript  a  i     superscript  10  n        x=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{a_{i}}{10^{i}}=\sum_{i=0}^{n}10^{n-i}a_{i}/10^{n}   for some n , then the denominator of x is of the form 10 n = 2 n 5 n .  Conversely, if the denominator of x is of the form 2 n 5 m ,    x  =   p    2  n    5  m     =     2  m    5  n   p     2   n  +  m     5   n  +  m      =     2  m    5  n   p    10   n  +  m           x    p     superscript  2  n    superscript  5  m               superscript  2  m    superscript  5  n   p      superscript  2    n  m     superscript  5    n  m                superscript  2  m    superscript  5  n   p    superscript  10    n  m        x=\frac{p}{2^{n}5^{m}}=\frac{2^{m}5^{n}p}{2^{n+m}5^{n+m}}=\frac{2^{m}5^{n}p}{1%
 0^{n+m}}   for some p . While x is of the form    p   10  k       p   superscript  10  k     \textstyle\frac{p}{10^{k}}   ,    p  =    ∑   i  =  0   n     10  i    a  i         p    superscript   subscript     i  0    n      superscript  10  i    subscript  a  i       p=\sum_{i=0}^{n}10^{i}a_{i}   for some n . By    x  =    ∑   i  =  0   n      10   n  -  i     a  i    /   10  n     =    ∑   i  =  0   n     a  i    10  i           x    superscript   subscript     i  0    n        superscript  10    n  i     subscript  a  i     superscript  10  n            superscript   subscript     i  0    n      subscript  a  i    superscript  10  i        x=\sum_{i=0}^{n}10^{n-i}a_{i}/10^{n}=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{a_{i}}{10^{i}}   , x will end in zeros.  Recurring decimal representations  Some real numbers have decimal expansions that eventually get into loops, endlessly repeating a sequence of one or more digits:   1 / 3 = 0.33333...  1 / 7 = 0.142857142857...  1318 / 185 = 7.1243243243...   Every time this happens the number is still a rational number (i.e. can alternatively be represented as a ratio of an integer and a positive integer).
