   Nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase      Nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase   In enzymology , a nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   nicotinate + 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate + ATP + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   nicotinate D-ribonucleotide + diphosphate + ADP + phosphate   Thus, the four substrates of this enzyme are nicotinate , 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate , ATP , and H 2 O , whereas its four products are nicotinate D-ribonucleotide , diphosphate , ADP , and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming generic carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is '''5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate:nicotinate ligase (ADP, diphosphate-forming) '''. Other names in common use include niacin ribonucleotidase , nicotinic acid mononucleotide glycohydrolase , nicotinic acid mononucleotide pyrophosphorylase , and nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
