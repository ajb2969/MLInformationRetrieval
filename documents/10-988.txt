   2'-deoxymugineic-acid 2'-dioxygenase      2'-deoxymugineic-acid 2'-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a 2'-deoxymugineic-acid 2'-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2'-deoxymugineic acid + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   mugineic acid + succinate + CO 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 2'-deoxymugineic acid , 2-oxoglutarate , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are mugineic acid , (a compound related to azetidine-2-carboxylic acid ) succinate , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2'-deoxymugineic acid,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (2-hydroxylating) . This enzyme is also called IDS3 .
