   Balayage      Balayage   Balayage is a French word meaning scanning or sweeping.  In potential theory , a mathematical discipline, balayage is a method devised by Henri Poincaré for reconstructing a harmonic function in a domain from its values on the boundary of the domain. 1  In modern terms, the balayage operator maps a measure  μ on a closed domain D to a measure ν on the boundary ∂ D , so that the Newtonian potentials of μ and ν coincide outside D . The procedure is called balayage since the mass is "swept out" from D onto the boundary.  For x in D , the balayage of δ x yields the harmonic measure  ν x corresponding to x . Then the value of a harmonic function f at x is equal to        f   (  x  )    =    ∫   ∂  D     f   (  y  )   d   ν  x    (  y  )      .        f  x     subscript     D      f  y  d   subscript  ν  x   y      f(x)=\int_{\partial D}f(y)\,d\nu_{x}(y).
