   Double (manifold)      Double (manifold)   In the subject of manifold theory in mathematics , if   M   M   M   is a manifold with boundary , its double is obtained by gluing two copies of   M   M   M   together along their common boundary. 1 Precisely, the double is    M  ×   {  0  ,  1  }   /  ∼     fragments  M    fragments  normal-{  0  normal-,  1  normal-}    similar-to    M\times\{0,1\}/\sim   where     (  x  ,  0  )   ∼   (  x  ,  1  )      similar-to   x  0    x  1     (x,0)\sim(x,1)   for all    x  ∈   ∂  M       x    M     x\in\partial M   .  Although the concept makes sense for any manifold, and even for some non-manifold sets such as the Alexander horned sphere , the notion of double tends to be used primarily in the context that    ∂  M      M    \partial M   is non-empty and   M   M   M   is compact .  Doubles bound  Given a manifold   M   M   M   , the double of   M   M   M   is the boundary of    M  ×   [  0  ,  1  ]       M   0  1     M\times[0,1]   . This gives doubles a special role in cobordism .  Examples  The n -sphere is the double of the n -ball . In this context, the two balls would be the upper and lower hemi-sphere respectively. More generally, if   M   M   M   is closed, the double of    M  ×   D  k       M   superscript  D  k     M\times D^{k}   is    M  ×   S  k       M   superscript  S  k     M\times S^{k}   . Even more generally, the double of a disc bundle over a manifold is a sphere bundle over the same manifold. More concretely, the double of the Möbius strip is the Klein bottle .  If   M   M   M   is a closed, oriented manifold and if    M  ′     superscript  M  normal-′    M^{\prime}   is obtained from   M   M   M   by removing an open ball, then the connected sum     M  #   -  M      normal-#  M    M     M\mathrel{\#}-M   is the double of    M  ′     superscript  M  normal-′    M^{\prime}   .  The double of a Mazur manifold is a homotopy 4-sphere . 2  References  "  Category:Differential topology  Category:Manifolds     . ↩  .
