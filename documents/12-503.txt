Double (manifold)

In the subject of manifold theory in mathematics, if 
 
 
 
  is a manifold with boundary, its double is obtained by gluing two copies of 
 
 
 
  together along their common boundary.1 Precisely, the double is 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
Although the concept makes sense for any manifold, and even for some non-manifold sets such as the Alexander horned sphere, the notion of double tends to be used primarily in the context that 
 
 
 
  is non-empty and 
 
 
 
  is compact.
Doubles bound
Given a manifold 
 
 
 
 , the double of 
 
 
 
  is the boundary of 
 
 
 
 . This gives doubles a special role in cobordism.
Examples
The n-sphere is the double of the n-ball. In this context, the two balls would be the upper and lower hemi-sphere respectively. More generally, if 
 
 
 
  is closed, the double of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . Even more generally, the double of a disc bundle over a manifold is a sphere bundle over the same manifold. More concretely, the double of the Möbius strip is the Klein bottle.
If 
 
 
 
  is a closed, oriented manifold and if 
 
 
 
  is obtained from 
 
 
 
  by removing an open ball, then the connected sum

 
  is the double of 
 
 
 
 .
The double of a Mazur manifold is a homotopy 4-sphere.2
