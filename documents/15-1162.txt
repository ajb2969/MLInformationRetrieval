   Spheroidene monooxygenase      Spheroidene monooxygenase   Spheroidene monooxygenase (, CrtA , acyclic carotenoid 2-ketolase , spirilloxantin monooxygenase , 2-oxo-spirilloxanthin monooxygenase ) is an enzyme with system name spheroidene,reduced-ferredoxin:oxygen oxidoreductase (spheroiden-2-one-forming) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   spheroidene + reduced ferredoxin + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   spheroiden-2-one + oxidized ferredoxin + H 2 O  spirilloxantin + reduced ferredoxin + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-oxospirilloxanthin + oxidized ferredoxin + H 2 O  2'-oxospirilloxanthin + reduced ferredoxin + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2,2'-dioxospirilloxanthin + oxidized ferredoxin + H 2 O   The enzyme is involved in spheroidenone biosynthesis and in 2,2'-dioxospirilloxanthin biosynthesis.
