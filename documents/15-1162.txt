Spheroidene monooxygenase

Spheroidene monooxygenase (, CrtA, acyclic carotenoid 2-ketolase, spirilloxantin monooxygenase, 2-oxo-spirilloxanthin monooxygenase) is an enzyme with system name spheroidene,reduced-ferredoxin:oxygen oxidoreductase (spheroiden-2-one-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

spheroidene + reduced ferredoxin + O2

 
  spheroiden-2-one + oxidized ferredoxin + H2O
 
spirilloxantin + reduced ferredoxin + O2

 
  2-oxospirilloxanthin + oxidized ferredoxin + H2O
 
2'-oxospirilloxanthin + reduced ferredoxin + O2

 
  2,2'-dioxospirilloxanthin + oxidized ferredoxin + H2O
 

The enzyme is involved in spheroidenone biosynthesis and in 2,2'-dioxospirilloxanthin biosynthesis.
