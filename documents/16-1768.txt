   Carrier-envelope phase      Carrier-envelope phase   The carrier-envelope phase (CEP) or carrier-envelope offset (CEO) phase is an important feature of an ultrashort laser pulse and gains significance with decreasing pulse duration , in a regime where the pulse consists of a few wavelenghts . Physical effects depending on the fall into the category of highly nonlinear optics .  CEP in the time domain  The CEP    ϕ  0     subscript  ϕ  0    \phi_{0}   is the phase between the carrier wave and the position of the intensity envelope of the pulse (cf. figure in the time domain). In a train of multiple pulses it is usually varying due to the difference between phase and group velocity . The time, after which the phase increases resp. decreases by    2  π      2  π    2\pi   is called    T  CEO     subscript  T  CEO    T_{\mathrm{CEO}}   >. Ideally, it is an integer multiple of the duration    T  rep     subscript  T  rep    T_{\mathrm{rep}}   between two pulses and the pulses are picked at the corresponding rate to obtain a constant phase over all picked pulses. Besides this linear evolution, fluctuations which are common in conventional femtosecond laser systems usually cause a nonlinear shot-to-shot fluctuation of the CEP. This is why measuring and controlling it is very important for many applications.  CEP in the frequency domain and measurement  In the frequency domain , a pulse train is represented by a frequency comb . Here, the carrier-envelope frequency     f  CEO   =   1   T  CEO    =    d   ϕ  0     d  t    =          subscript  f  CEO     1   subscript  T  CEO             normal-d   subscript  ϕ  0      normal-d  t         absent     f_{\mathrm{CEO}}=\frac{1}{T_{\mathrm{CEO}}}=\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi_{0}}{\mathrm{%
 d}t}=   is exactly the offset frequency of the pulse train, cf. figure. This makes it possible to perform a multi-shot measurement of the CEP, for example by using an f-2f interferometer . Here, the pulses to be measured are broadened to a bandwidth of at least one octave. A long-wavelength part of the pulse is frequency doubled and the beat note between it and the short-wavelength part of the fundamental pulse is measured. This is better known as the offset phase.  With a phase-locked loop , a property of the laser oscillator such as the optical path length can be adjusted correspondingly to the obtained offset frequency and thus the phase can be stabilized.
