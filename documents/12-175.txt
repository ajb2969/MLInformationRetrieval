   Dunford–Pettis property      Dunford–Pettis property   In functional analysis , the Dunford–Pettis property , named after Nelson Dunford and B. J. Pettis , is a property of a Banach space stating that all weakly compact operators from this space into another Banach space are completely continuous. Many standard Banach spaces have this property, most notably, the space C ( K ) of continuous functions on a compact space and the space L 1 ( μ ) of the Lebesgue integrable functions on a measure space . Alexander Grothendieck introduced the concept in the early 1950s , following the work of Dunford and Pettis, who developed earlier results of Shizuo Kakutani , Kōsaku Yosida , and several others. Important results were obtained more recently by Jean Bourgain . Nevertheless, the Dunford–Pettis property is not completely understood.  Definition  A Banach space X has the Dunford–Pettis property if every continuous weakly compact operator  T : X → Y from X into another Banach space Y transforms weakly compact sets in X into norm-compact sets in Y (such operators are called completely continuous ). An important equivalent definition is that for any weakly convergent  sequences ( x n ) of X and ( f n ) of the dual space  X ∗ , converging (weakly) to x and f , the sequence f n ( x n ) converges to f(x) .  Counterexamples   The second definition may appear counterintuitive at first, but consider an orthonormal basis e n of a separable Hilbert space H . Then e n → 0 weakly, but for all n ,          ⟨   e  n   ,   e  n   ⟩   =  1.        subscript  e  n    subscript  e  n    1.    \langle e_{n},e_{n}\rangle=1.         Thus separable Hilbert spaces cannot have the Dunford–Pettis property.    Consider as another example the space L p (−π,π) where 1n= e inx in L p and f n = e inx in L q = ( L p )* both converge weakly to zero. But           ⟨   f  n   ,   x  n   ⟩   =    ∫   -  π   π     1   d  x    =   2  π    .          subscript  f  n    subscript  x  n      superscript   subscript     π    π     1  normal-d  x           2  π      \langle f_{n},x_{n}\rangle=\int\limits_{-\pi}^{\pi}1\,{\rm d}x=2\pi.         More generally, no infinite-dimensional reflexive Banach space may have the Dunford–Pettis property. In particular, a Hilbert space and more generally, Lp spaces with 1 < p < ∞ do not possess this property.   Examples   If X is a compact Hausdorff space , then the Banach space C( X ) of continuous functions with the uniform norm has the Dunford–Pettis property.
