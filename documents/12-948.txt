Multidimensional Chebyshev's inequality

In probability theory, the multidimensional Chebyshev's inequality is a generalization of Chebyshev's inequality, which puts a bound on the probability of the event that a random variable differs from its expected value by more than a specified amount.
Let X be an N-dimensional random vector with expected value

 
  and covariance matrix



If 
 
 
 
  is a positive-definite matrix, for any real number

 
 :



Proof
Since 
 
 
 
  is positive-definite, so is 
 
 
 
 . Define the random variable


 
  Since 
 
 
 
  is positive, Markov's inequality holds:


 
  Finally,
