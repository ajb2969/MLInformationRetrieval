   Shadowing lemma      Shadowing lemma    A Shadowing lemma is also a fictional creature in the Discworld. See Shadowing lemma .    In the theory of dynamical systems , the shadowing lemma is a lemma describing the behaviour of pseudo-orbits near a hyperbolic invariant set . Informally, the theory states that every pseudo-orbit (which one can think of as a numerically computed trajectory with rounding errors on every step 1 ) stays uniformly close to some true trajectory (with slightly altered initial position) — in other words, a pseudo-trajectory is "shadowed" by a true one. Incapability of the shadowing lemma on digital chaos are presented in the International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, 2 Sec. 2.2.3.  Formal statement  Given a map f : X → X of a metric space ( X , d ) to itself, define a ε-pseudo-orbit (or ε-orbit ) as a sequence $(x_n)$ of points such that $x_{n+1}$ belongs to a ε-neighborhood of $f(x_n)$ .  Then, near a hyperbolic invariant set, the following statement holds: 3 Let Λ be a hyperbolic invariant set of a diffeomorphism f. There exists a neighborhood U of Λ with the following property: for any δ > 0 there exists ε > 0, such that any (finite or infinite) ε-pseudo-orbit that stays in U also stays in a δ-neighborhood of some true orbit.  $$\forall (x_n),\, x_n\in U, \, d(x_{n+1},f(x_n))<\varepsilon \quad \exists (y_n), \, \, y_{n+1}=f(y_n),\quad \text{such that} \,\, \forall n \,\, x_n\in U_{\delta}(y_n).$$  References   Scholarpedia article Shadowing Theorem   "  Category:Dynamical systems  Category:Lemmas     ↩  ↩  A.
