   Adenylyl-sulfate reductase (thioredoxin)      Adenylyl-sulfate reductase (thioredoxin)   Adenylyl-sulfate reductase (thioredoxin) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   AMP + sulfite + thioredoxin disulfide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5'-adenylyl sulfate + thioredoxin   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are adenosine monophosphate , sulfite , and thioredoxin disulfide , whereas its two products are 5'-adenylyl sulfate and thioredoxin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with a disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is AMP,sulfite:thioredoxin-disulfide oxidoreductase (adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate-forming) . This enzyme is also called thioredoxin-dependent 5'-adenylylsulfate reductase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
