   UTP—hexose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase      UTP—hexose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase   In enzymology , an UTP—hexose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UTP + alpha-D-galactose 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + UDP-galactose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UTP and alpha-D-galactose 1-phosphate , whereas its two products are diphosphate and UDP-galactose .  Enzyme family  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is UTP:alpha-D-hexose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Other names in common use include galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, alpha-D-galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, galactose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase, UDPgalactose pyrophosphorylase, uridine diphosphate galactose pyrophosphorylase, and uridine diphosphogalactose pyrophosphorylase. This enzyme participates in galactose metabolism and nucleotide sugars metabolism .  Structural studies  , 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
