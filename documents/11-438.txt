   ADP-dependent short-chain-acyl-CoA hydrolase      ADP-dependent short-chain-acyl-CoA hydrolase   In enzymology , an ADP-dependent short-chain-acyl-CoA hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acyl-CoA + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + a carboxylate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and H 2 O , whereas its two products are CoA and carboxylate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ADP-dependent-short-chain-acyl-CoA hydrolase . Other names in common use include short-chain acyl coenzyme A hydrolase , propionyl coenzyme A hydrolase , propionyl-CoA hydrolase , propionyl-CoA thioesterase , short-chain acyl-CoA hydrolase , and short-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase . It employs one cofactor , ADP . At least one compound, NADH is known to inhibit this enzyme .  References      "  Category:EC 3.1.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
