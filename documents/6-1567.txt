   Radiant flux      Radiant flux   In radiometry , radiant flux or radiant power is the radiant energy emitted, reflected, transmitted or received, per unit time, and spectral flux or spectral power is the radiant flux per unit frequency or wavelength , depending on whether the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. The SI unit of radiant flux is the watt (W), that is the joule per second () in SI base units, while that of spectral flux in frequency is the watt per hertz () and that of spectral flux in wavelength is the watt per metre ()—commonly the watt per nanometre ().  Mathematical definitions  Radiant flux  Radiant flux , denoted Φ e ("e" for "energetic", to avoid confusion with photometric quantities), is defined as 1        Φ  e   =    ∂   Q  e     ∂  t     ,       subscript  normal-Φ  normal-e        subscript  Q  normal-e      t      \Phi_{\mathrm{e}}=\frac{\partial Q_{\mathrm{e}}}{\partial t},   where   ∂ is the partial derivative symbol;  Q e is the radiant energy emitted, reflected, transmitted or received;  t is the time.   Spectral flux  Spectral flux in frequency , denoted Φ e,ν , is defined as 2        Φ   e  ,  ν    =    ∂   Φ  e     ∂  ν     ,       subscript  normal-Φ   normal-e  ν         subscript  normal-Φ  normal-e      ν      \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu}=\frac{\partial\Phi_{\mathrm{e}}}{\partial\nu},   where ν is the frequency.  Spectral flux in wavelength , denoted Φ e,λ , is defined as 3        Φ   e  ,  λ    =    ∂   Φ  e     ∂  λ     ,       subscript  normal-Φ   normal-e  λ         subscript  normal-Φ  normal-e      λ      \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda}=\frac{\partial\Phi_{\mathrm{e}}}{\partial\lambda},   where λ is the wavelength.  Relationship with the Poynting vector  One can show that the radiant flux of a surface is the flux of the Poynting vector through this surface, hence the name "radiant flux":        Φ  e   =    ∮  Σ     𝐒  ⋅    𝐧  ^     d  A    =    ∮  Σ     |  𝐒  |    cos    α   d  A       ,         subscript  normal-Φ  normal-e     subscript  contour-integral  normal-Σ      normal-⋅  𝐒   normal-^  𝐧    normal-d  A           subscript  contour-integral  normal-Σ       𝐒       α  normal-d  A         \Phi_{\mathrm{e}}=\oint_{\Sigma}\mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}\,\mathrm{d}A=%
 \oint_{\Sigma}|\mathbf{S}|\cos\alpha\,\mathrm{d}A,   where   Σ is the surface;  S is the Poynting vector;  n is a unit normal vector to that surface;  A is the area of that surface;  α is the angle between n and S .   But the time-average of the norm of the Poynting vector is used instead, because in radiometry it is the only quantity that radiation detectors are able measure:        Φ  e   =    ∮  Σ     ⟨   |  𝐒  |   ⟩    cos    α   d  A       ,       subscript  normal-Φ  normal-e     subscript  contour-integral  normal-Σ      delimited-⟨⟩    𝐒        α  normal-d  A        \Phi_{\mathrm{e}}=\oint_{\Sigma}\langle|\mathbf{S}|\rangle\cos\alpha\,\mathrm{%
