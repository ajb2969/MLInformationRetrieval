Radiant flux

In radiometry, radiant flux or radiant power is the radiant energy emitted, reflected, transmitted or received, per unit time, and spectral flux or spectral power is the radiant flux per unit frequency or wavelength, depending on whether the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. The SI unit of radiant flux is the watt (W), that is the joule per second () in SI base units, while that of spectral flux in frequency is the watt per hertz () and that of spectral flux in wavelength is the watt per metre ()—commonly the watt per nanometre ().
Mathematical definitions
Radiant flux
Radiant flux, denoted Φe ("e" for "energetic", to avoid confusion with photometric quantities), is defined as1


 
  where

∂ is the partial derivative symbol;
Qe is the radiant energy emitted, reflected, transmitted or received;
t is the time.

Spectral flux
Spectral flux in frequency, denoted Φe,ν, is defined as2


 
  where ν is the frequency.
Spectral flux in wavelength, denoted Φe,λ, is defined as3


 
  where λ is the wavelength.
Relationship with the Poynting vector
One can show that the radiant flux of a surface is the flux of the Poynting vector through this surface, hence the name "radiant flux":


 
  where

Σ is the surface;
S is the Poynting vector;
n is a unit normal vector to that surface;
A is the area of that surface;
α is the angle between n and S.

But the time-average of the norm of the Poynting vector is used instead, because in radiometry it is the only quantity that radiation detectors are able measure:


 
  where  is the time-average.
