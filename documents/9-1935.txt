   Weisz-Prater Criterion      Weisz-Prater Criterion   The Weisz-Prater Criterion is a method used to estimate the influence of pore diffusion on reaction rates in heterogeneous catalytic reactions. 1 If the criterion is satisfied, pore diffusion limitations are negligible. The criterion is      N   W  -  P    =     ℜ   R  p  2      C  s    D   e  f  f       ≤   3  β          subscript  N    W  P        ℜ   subscript   superscript  R  2   p       subscript  C  s    subscript  D    e  f  f             3  β      N_{W-P}=\dfrac{\mathfrak{R}R^{2}_{p}}{C_{s}D_{eff}}\leq 3\beta    Where   ℜ   ℜ   \mathfrak{R}   is the reaction rate per volume of catalyst,    R  p     subscript  R  p    R_{p}   is the catalyst particle radius,    C  s     subscript  C  s    C_{s}   is the reactant concentration at the particle surface, and    D   e  f  f      subscript  D    e  f  f     D_{eff}   is the effective diffusivity . Diffusion is usually in the Knudsen regime when average pore radius is less than 100 nm. For a given effectiveness factor,   η   η   \eta   , and reaction order , n, the quantity   β   β   \beta   is defined by the equation:     η  =     3   R  p  3       ∫  0   R  p      [   1  -   β    (   1  -   r  /   R  p     )   n     ]     r  2    d  r         η      3   subscript   superscript  R  3   p      superscript   subscript   0    subscript  R  p       delimited-[]    1    β   superscript    1    r   subscript  R  p     n       superscript  r  2   d  r       \eta=\dfrac{3}{R^{3}_{p}}\int_{0}^{R_{p}}[1-\beta(1-r/R_{p})^{n}]r^{2}\ dr    for small values of beta this can be approximated using the binomial theorem :     η  =   1  -     n  β   4         η    1      n  β   4      \eta=1-\dfrac{n\beta}{4}    Assuming    η  ≥  0.95      η  0.95    \eta\geq 0.95   with a 1st or zero order reaction gives values of   β   β   \beta   , 0.6 and 6 respectively. Therefore for many conditions, if     N   W  -  P    ≤  0.3       subscript  N    W  P    0.3    N_{W-P}\leq 0.3   then pore diffusion limitations can be excluded. 2  References    "  Category:Scientific techniques  Category:Laboratory techniques  Category:Transport phenomena  Category:Chemical reaction engineering     ↩  ↩
