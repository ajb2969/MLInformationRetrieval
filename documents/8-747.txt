   Kendall's W      Kendall's W   Kendall's W (also known as Kendall's coefficient of concordance ) is a non-parametric statistic . It is a normalization of the statistic of the Friedman test , and can be used for assessing agreement among raters. Kendall's W ranges from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (complete agreement).  Suppose, for instance, that a number of people have been asked to rank a list of political concerns, from most important to least important. Kendall's W can be calculated from these data. If the test statistic W is 1, then all the survey respondents have been unanimous, and each respondent has assigned the same order to the list of concerns. If W is 0, then there is no overall trend of agreement among the respondents, and their responses may be regarded as essentially random. Intermediate values of W indicate a greater or lesser degree of unanimity among the various responses.  While tests using the standard Pearson correlation coefficient assume normally distributed values and compare two sequences of outcomes at a time, Kendall's W makes no assumptions regarding the nature of the probability distribution and can handle any number of distinct outcomes.  W is linearly related to the mean value of the Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between all pairs of the rankings over which it is calculated.  Definition  Suppose that object i is given the rank r i,j by judge number j , where there are in total n objects and m judges. Then the total rank given to object i is        R  i   =    ∑   j  =  1   m    r   i  ,  j      ,       subscript  R  i     superscript   subscript     j  1    m    subscript  r   i  j       R_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}r_{i,j},   and the mean value of these total ranks is        R  ¯   =    1  n     ∑   i  =  1   n    R  i      .       normal-¯  R       1  n     superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  R  i       \bar{R}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}R_{i}.   The sum of squared deviations, S , is defined as       S  =    ∑   i  =  1   n     (    R  i   -   R  ¯    )   2     ,      S    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript     subscript  R  i    normal-¯  R    2      S=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(R_{i}-\bar{R})^{2},   and then Kendall's W is defined as 1       W  =    12  S     m  2    (    n  3   -  n   )      .      W      12  S      superscript  m  2      superscript  n  3   n       W=\frac{12S}{m^{2}(n^{3}-n)}.     If the test statistic W is 1, then all the judges or survey respondents have been unanimous, and each judge or respondent has assigned the same order to the list of objects or concerns. If W is 0, then there is no overall trend of agreement among the respondents, and their responses may be regarded as essentially random. Intermediate values of W indicate a greater or lesser degree of unanimity among the various judges or respondents.  Legendre 2 discusses a variant of the W statistic which accommodates ties in the rankings and also describes methods of making significance tests based on W .  Correction for ties  When tied values occur, they are each given the average of the ranks that would have been given had no ties occurred. For example, the data set {80,76,34,80,73,80} has values of 80 tied for 4th, 5th, and 6th place; since the mean of {4,5,6} = 5, ranks would be assigned to the raw data values as follows: {5,3,1,5,2,5}.  The effect of ties is to reduce the value of W ; however, this effect is small unless there are a large number of ties. To correct for ties, assign ranks to tied values as above and compute the correction factors        T  j   =    ∑   i  =  1    g  j     (    t  i  3   -   t  i    )     ,       subscript  T  j     superscript   subscript     i  1     subscript  g  j       superscript   subscript  t  i   3    subscript  t  i       T_{j}=\sum_{i=1}^{g_{j}}(t_{i}^{3}-t_{i}),   where t i is the number of tied ranks in the i th group of tied ranks, (where a group is a set of values having constant (tied) rank,) and g j is the number of groups of ties in the set of ranks (ranging from 1 to n ) for judge j . Thus, T j is the correction factor required for the set of ranks for judge j , i.e. the j th set of ranks. Note that if there are no tied ranks for judge j , T j equals 0.  With the correction for ties, the formula for W becomes       W  =     12    ∑   i  =  1   n    (   R  i  2   )     -   3   m  2   n    (   n  +  1   )   2        m  2   n   (    n  2   -  1   )    -   m    ∑   j  =  1   m    (   T  j   )        ,      W        12    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript   subscript  R  i   2       3   superscript  m  2   n   superscript    n  1   2          superscript  m  2   n     superscript  n  2   1      m    superscript   subscript     j  1    m    subscript  T  j         W=\frac{12\sum_{i=1}^{n}(R_{i}^{2})-3m^{2}n(n+1)^{2}}{m^{2}n(n^{2}-1)-m\sum_{j%
 =1}^{m}(T_{j})},   where R i is the sum of the ranks for object i , and     ∑   j  =  1   m    (   T  j   )       superscript   subscript     j  1    m    subscript  T  j     \sum_{j=1}^{m}(T_{j})   is the sum of the values of T j over all m sets of ranks. 3  See also   Maurice Kendall  Kendall's Tau   Notes  References    Corder, G.W., Foreman, D.I.
