Quantum sort

A quantum sort is any sorting algorithm that runs on a quantum computer. Any comparison-based quantum sorting algorithm would take at least 
 
 
 
  steps,1 which is already achievable by classical algorithms. Thus, for this task, quantum computers are no better than classical ones. However, in space-bounded sorts, quantum algorithms outperform their classical counterparts.2
