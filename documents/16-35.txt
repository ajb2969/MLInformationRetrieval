   Aphidicolan-16beta-ol synthase      Aphidicolan-16beta-ol synthase   Aphidicolan-16beta-ol synthase (, PbACS ) is an enzyme with system name 9alpha-copalyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (aphidicolan-16beta-ol-forming) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   9alpha-copalyl diphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   aphidicolan-16beta-ol + diphosphate    This is a bifunctional enzyme, which also has EC 5.5.1.14 activity.
