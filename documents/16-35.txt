Aphidicolan-16beta-ol synthase

Aphidicolan-16beta-ol synthase (, PbACS) is an enzyme with system name 9alpha-copalyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (aphidicolan-16beta-ol-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

9alpha-copalyl diphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  aphidicolan-16beta-ol + diphosphate


This is a bifunctional enzyme, which also has EC 5.5.1.14 activity.
