Table of congruences

In mathematics, a congruence is an equivalence relation on the integers. The following table lists important or interesting congruences.








special case of Fermat's little theorem, satisfied by all odd prime numbers







solutions are called Wieferich primes







satisfied by all prime numbers







solutions are called Wall–Sun–Sun primes







by Wolstenholme's theorem satisfied by all prime numbers greater than 3







solutions are called Wolstenholme primes







by Wilson's theorem a natural number n is prime if and only if it satisfies this congruence







solutions are called Wilson primes
