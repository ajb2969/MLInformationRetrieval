   Breusch–Pagan test      Breusch–Pagan test   In statistics , the Breusch–Pagan test , developed in 1979 by Trevor Breusch and Adrian Pagan , 1 is used to test for heteroskedasticity in a linear regression model. It was independently suggested with some extension by R. Dennis Cook and Sanford Weisberg in 1983. 2 It tests whether the estimated variance of the residuals from a regression are dependent on the values of the independent variables. In that case, heteroskedasticity is present.  Suppose that we estimate the regression model       y  =    β  0   +    β  1   x   +  u    ,      y     subscript  β  0      subscript  β  1   x   u     y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x+u,\,     and obtain from this fitted model a set of values for    u  ^     normal-^  u    \hat{u}   , the residuals. Ordinary least squares constrains these so that their mean is 0 and so, given the assumption that their variance does not depend on the independent variables , an estimate of this variance can be obtained from the average of the squared values of the residuals. If the assumption is not held to be true, a simple model might be that the variance is linearly related to independent variables. Such a model can be examined by regressing the squared residuals on the independent variables, using an auxiliary regression equation of the form         u  ^   2   =    γ  0   +    γ  1   x   +  v    .       superscript   normal-^  u   2      subscript  γ  0      subscript  γ  1   x   v     \hat{u}^{2}=\gamma_{0}+\gamma_{1}x+v.\,     This is the basis of the Breusch–Pagan test. If an F-test confirms that the independent variables are jointly significant then the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity can be rejected.  The Breusch–Pagan test tests for conditional heteroscedasticity. It is a chi-squared test : the test statistic is n χ 2 with k degrees of freedom. It tests the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity. If the Chi Squared value is significant with p-value below an appropriate threshold (e.g. p\sigma_i^2 = h(z_i'\gamma) for the variances of the observations where     z  i   =   (  1  ,   z   2  i    ,  …  ,   z   p  i    )        subscript  z  i    1   subscript  z    2  i    normal-…   subscript  z    p  i       z_{i}=(1,z_{2i},\dots,z_{pi})   explain the difference in the variances. The null hypothesis is equivalent to the    (   p  -  1   )      p  1    (p-1)\,   parameter restrictions:       γ  2   =  …  =   γ  p   =  0.         subscript  γ  2   normal-…        subscript  γ  p        0.     \gamma_{2}=\dots=\gamma_{p}=0.   The following Lagrange multiplier (LM) yields the test statistic for the Breusch–Pagan test:        L  M   =     (    ∂  l    ∂  θ    )   ′     (   -   E   [     ∂  2   l     ∂  θ    ∂   θ  ′      ]     )    -  1     (    ∂  l    ∂  θ    )     .        L  M      superscript      l     θ    normal-′    superscript      E   delimited-[]      superscript   2   l       θ      superscript  θ  normal-′           1        l     θ       LM=\left(\frac{\partial l}{\partial\theta}\right)^{\prime}\left(-E\left[\frac{%
 \partial^{2}l}{\partial\theta\partial\theta^{\prime}}\right]\right)^{-1}\left(%
 \frac{\partial l}{\partial\theta}\right).   This test is analogous to following the simple three-step procedure: 3   Step 1 : Apply OLS in the model        y  =    X  β   +  ε    .      y      X  β   ε     y=X\beta+\varepsilon.   and compute the regression residuals.   Step 2 : Perform the auxiliary regression         e  i  2   =    γ  1   +    γ  2    z   2  i     +  …  +    γ  p    z   p  i     +   η  i     .       superscript   subscript  e  i   2      subscript  γ  1      subscript  γ  2    subscript  z    2  i     normal-…     subscript  γ  p    subscript  z    p  i      subscript  η  i      e_{i}^{2}=\gamma_{1}+\gamma_{2}z_{2i}+\dots+\gamma_{p}z_{pi}+\eta_{i}.      Step 3 : The test statistic is the result of the coefficient of determination of the auxiliary regression in Step 2 and sample size    n    n   n\,   with:         L  M   =   n    R  2      .        L  M     n   superscript  R  2      LM=nR^{2}\,.   The test statistic is asymptotically distributed as    χ   p  -  1   2     subscript   superscript  χ  2     p  1     \chi^{2}_{p-1}   under the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity. 4  Software  In R , this test is performed by function ncvTest available in the car  package , 5 or by function '''bptest '''available in the lmtest package. 6  In Stata, one specifies the full regression, and then enters the command estat hettest followed by all independent variables. 7  In SAS, breusch pagan can be obtained using the Proc Model option.  In Python, there is a method het_breushpagan in statsmodels.stats.diagnostic (the statsmodels package) for breusch-pagan test.
