   Acetaldehyde      Acetaldehyde   Acetaldehyde (systematic name ethanal ) is an organic chemical compound with the formula  CH 3 CHO , sometimes abbreviated by chemists as MeCHO (Me = methyl ). It is one of the most important aldehydes , occurring widely in nature and being produced on a large scale in industry. Acetaldehyde occurs naturally in coffee, bread, and ripe fruit, and is produced by plants. It is also produced by the partial oxidation of ethanol by the liver enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and may be a contributing factor to hangovers from alcohol consumption. Pathways of exposure include air, water, land, or groundwater, as well as drink and smoke. 1 Consumption of disulfiram inhibits acetaldehyde dehydrogenase , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of acetaldehyde, thereby causing it to build up in the body.  The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has listed acetaldehyde as a Group 1 carcinogen. 2  History  Acetaldehyde was first observed by the Swedish pharmacist/chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele (1774); 3 it was then investigated by the French chemists Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin (1800), and the German chemists Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner (1821, 1822, 1832) See:   (Döbereiner) (1821) "Neue Aether" (A new ether), Journal für Chemie und Physik , 32 : 269–270. Döbereiner names the new "ether" "Sauerstoffäther" (oxygen-ether).  (Döbereiner) (1822) [ http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?num=124&u; ;=1&seq;=344&view;=1up&size;=100&id;=nyp.33433069069148&q1;=D%C3%B6bereiner#view=1up;seq=140 "Döbereiner's Apparat zur Darstellung des Sauerstoffaethers"] (Döbereiner's apparatus for the preparation of oxygen-ether), Journal für Chemie und Physik , 34 : 124–125.  Döbereiner, J. W. (1832) [ https://books.google.com/books?id=mAYAAAAAMAAJ&pg; ;=PA466 "Bildung des Sauerstoff-Aethers durch atmosphärische Oxidation des Alkohols"] (Formation of oxy-ether by atmospheric oxidation of alcohol), Journal für Chemie und Physik , 64 : 466–468. In this paper, Döbereiner made acetaldehyde by exposing ethanol vapor to air in the presence of platinum black. and Justus von Liebig (1835). 4 In 1835, Liebig named it "aldehyde"; 5 the name was later altered to "acetaldehyde". 6   Production  In 2003, global production was about 1 million tonnes. Before 1962, ethanol and acetylene were the major sources of acetaldehyde. Since then, ethylene is the dominant feedstock. 7  The main production method is the oxidation of ethylene via the Wacker process . The process involves oxidation of ethylene using a homogeneous palladium/copper system:   2 CH 2 =CH 2 + O 2 → 2 CH 3 CHO   In the 1970s, the world capacity of this process, the Wacker-Hoechst direct oxidation, increased to over 2 million tonnes/year.  When smaller quantities are required, it can also be prepared by the partial oxidation of ethanol, in an exothermic reaction. This process typically is conducted over a silver catalyst at about 500–650 °C. 8   CH 3 CH 2 OH + 1/2 O 2 → CH 3 CHO + H 2 O   This method is one of the oldest routes for the industrial of preparation of acetaldehyde.  Acetaldehyde can also be produced by the hydration of acetylene , catalyzed by mercury salts. The reaction produces ethenol, which tautomerizes to acetaldehyde. This industrial route was dominant prior to the Wacker process . 9 One drawback of this process is the formation of polymerization and condensation products of acetaldehyde. Furthermore, the production of acetylene is costly and environmentally problematic. The wet oxidation process was used before the Wacker process was commercially established. Iron(III) sulfate is added to reoxidize the mercury metal to the mercury(II) salt to maintain required concentration of catalyst and, thus, avoiding direct handling of mercury. Acetylene reacts at 90–95 °C and the acetaldehyde formed is separated from water and mercury and cooled to 25–30 °C. Iron(II) sulfate is formed in the reaction and is oxidized in a separate reactor with 30% nitric acid at 95 °C. Pure acetaldehyde is obtained by fractional distillation of the aqueous solution at about 200 kPa.  Other methods  Traditionally but no longer viable economically, acetaldehyde was produced by the partial dehydrogenation of ethanol:   CH 3 CH 2 OH → CH 3 CHO + H 2    In this endothermic process, ethanol vapor is passed at 260–290 °C over a copper-based catalyst. The process was once attractive because of the value of the hydrogen coproduct. 10  The hydroformylation of methanol with catalysts like cobalt, nickel, or iron salts also produces acetaldehyde. This process is of no industrial importance. Similarly noncompetitive, acetaldehyde arises from synthesis gas with modest selectivity. 11  Reactions  Like many other carbonyl compounds , acetaldehyde tautomerizes to give the enol . The enol of acetaldehyde is vinyl alcohol (IUPAC name: ethenol):   CH 3 CH=O    ←  →     normal-→  normal-←    \overrightarrow{\leftarrow}   CH 2 =CHOH   The equilibrium constant is only 6     ×    10  −   7       absent     superscript  10  normal-−   7     \times 10^{−}7   at room temperature, so that the amount of the enol in a sample of acetaldehyde is very small. 12  thumb|left|upright=1.3|Ethanal-ethenol tautomerism  Tautomerization of acetaldehyde to vinyl alcohol  At room temperature, acetaldehyde (CH 3 CH=O) is more stable than vinyl alcohol (CH 2 =CHOH) by 42.7 kJ/mol: 13  CH 2 =CHOH → CH 3 CH=O         ∆ H 298,g = –42.7 kJ/mol  This keto-enol tautomerization has a very high reaction barrier height and will therefore not occur at room temperature. Nevertheless, it was recently found that this keto-enol tautomerization can be efficiently catalyzed via photochemical process 14 or by inorganic acid catalysts (e.g. HClO 4 and H 2 SO 4 ). 15 These findings suggest that the keto-enol tautomerization is a viable route under atmospheric and stratospheric conditions, and have received considerable attention due to their potential atmospheric implications, since vinyl alcohol is believed to be a key intermediate in the production of organic acids in the atmosphere. 16 17  Condensation reactions  Because of its small size and its availability as the anhydrous monomer (unlike formaldehyde), it is a common electrophile in organic synthesis . 18 With respect to its condensation reactions, acetaldehyde is prochiral . It is mainly used as a source of the "CH 3 C + H(OH)" synthon in aldol and related condensation reactions. 19 Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds react with MeCHO to give hydroxyethyl derivatives. 20 In one of the more spectacular condensation reactions, three equivalents of formaldehyde add to MeCHO to give pentaerythritol , C(CH 2 OH) 4 . 21  In a Strecker reaction , acetaldehyde condenses with cyanide and ammonia to give, after hydrolysis , the amino acid alanine. 22 Acetaldehyde can condense with amines to yield imines, such as the condensation with cyclohexylamine to give N-ethylidenecyclohexylamine. These imines can be used to direct subsequent reactions like an aldol condensation. 23  It is also an important building block for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds . A remarkable example is its conversion upon treatment with ammonia to 5-ethyl-2-methylpyridine ("aldehyde-collidine”). 24  Acetal derivatives  Three molecules of acetaldehyde condense to form “ paraldehyde ,” a cyclic trimer containing C-O single bonds. The condensation of four molecules of acetaldehyde give the cyclic molecule called metaldehyde .  Acetaldehyde forms a stable acetal upon reaction with ethanol under conditions that favor dehydration. The product, CH 3 CH(OCH 2 CH 3 ) 2 , is in fact called "acetal". 25 although acetal is used more widely to describe other compounds with the formula RCH(OR') 2  Biochemistry  In the liver , the enzyme  alcohol dehydrogenase oxidizes ethanol into acetaldehyde, which is then further oxidized into harmless acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase . These two oxidation reactions are coupled with the reduction of NAD + to NADH . 26 In the brain, alcohol dehydrogenase has a minor role in the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. Instead, primarily the enzyme catalase oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde. 27 The last steps of alcoholic fermentation in bacteria, plants, and yeast involve the conversion of pyruvate into acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide by the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase , followed by the conversion of acetaldehyde into ethanol. The latter reaction is again catalyzed by an alcohol dehydrogenase, now operating in the opposite direction.  Uses  Traditionally, acetaldehyde was mainly used as a precursor to acetic acid. This application has declined because acetic acid is made more efficiently from methanol by the Monsanto and Cativa processes . In terms of condensation reactions, acetaldehyde is an important precursor to pyridine derivatives, pentaerythritol , and crotonaldehyde . Urea and acetaldehyde combine to give a useful resin . Acetic anhydride reacts with acetaldehyde to give ethylidene diacetate , a precursor to vinyl acetate , which is used to produce polyvinyl acetate .  Global market for acetaldehyde is declining. Demand has been impacted by changes in the production of plasticizer alcohols, which has shifted from n-butyraldehyde based on acetaldehyde to hydroformylation of propylene . Likewise, acetic acid , once produced from acetaldehyde, is made predominantly by the lower-cost methanol carbonylation process. 28 The impact on demand has led to increase in prices and thus slowdown in the market. Consumption of acetaldehyde (10 3 t) in 2003 29 (* Included in others -glyoxal/glyoxalic acid, crotonaldehyde, lactic acid, n-butanol, 2-ethylhexanol)      Product   USA   Mexico   W.

Major use has been the production of acetic acid. Other uses such as pyridines and pentaerythritol are expected to grow faster than acetic acid, but the volumes are not large enough to offset the decline in acetic acid. As a consequence, overall acetaldehyde consumption in China may grow slightly at 1.6% per year through 2018. Western Europe is the second-largest consumer of acetaldehyde worldwide, accounting for 20% of world consumption in 2012. As with China, the Western European acetaldehyde market is expected to increase only very slightly at 1% per year during 2012–2018. However, Japan could emerge as a potential consumer for acetaldehyde in next five years due to newfound use in commercial production of butadiene . The supply of butadiene has been volatile in Japan and the rest of Asia. This should provide the much needed boost to the flat market, as of 2013. 30  Safety  Exposure limits  The threshold limit value is 25ppm (STEL/ceiling value) and the MAK (Maximum Workplace Concentration) is 50 ppm. At 50 ppm acetaldehyde, no irritation or local tissue damage in the nasal mucosa is observed. When taken up by the organism, acetaldehyde is metabolized rapidly in the liver to acetic acid. Only a small proportion is exhaled unchanged. After intravenous injection, the half-life in the blood is approximately 90 seconds. 31  Dangers  Toxicity  Acetaldehyde is toxic when applied externally for prolonged periods, an irritant, and a probable carcinogen. 32 Acetaldehyde naturally breaks down in the human body 33 but has been shown to excrete in urine of rats. 34  Irritation  Acetaldehyde is an irritant of the skin, eyes, mucous membranes, throat, and respiratory tract. This occurs at concentrations up to 1000 ppm. Symptoms of exposure to this compound include nausea, vomiting, headache. These symptoms may not happen immediately. The perception limit of acetaldehyde in air is in the range between 0.07 and 0.25 ppm. 35 At such concentrations, the fruity odor of acetaldehyde is apparent. Conjunctival irritations have been observed after a 15-minute exposure to concentrations of 25 and 50 ppm, but transient conjunctivitis and irritation of the respiratory tract have been reported after exposure to 200 ppm acetaldehyde for 15 minutes. It has a general narcotic action and large doses can even cause death by respiratory paralysis. It may also cause drowsiness, delirium, hallucinations, and loss of intelligence. Exposure may also cause severe damage to the mouth, throat, and stomach; accumulation of fluid in the lungs, chronic respiratory disease, kidney and liver damage, throat irritation, dizziness, reddening, and swelling of the skin.  Carcinogenicity  Acetaldehyde is carcinogen in humans. 36 37 In 1988 the International Agency for Research on Cancer stated, "There is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of acetaldehyde (the major metabolite of ethanol) in experimental animals." 38 In October 2009 the International Agency for Research on Cancer updated the classification of acetaldehyde stating that acetaldehyde included in and generated endogenously from alcoholic beverages is a Group I human carcinogen. 39 In addition, acetaldehyde is damaging to DNA 40 and causes abnormal muscle development as it binds to proteins. 41  Aggravating factors  Alzheimer's disease  People with a genetic deficiency for the enzyme responsible for the conversion of acetaldehyde into acetic acid may have a greater risk of Alzheimer's disease . "These results indicate that the ALDH2 deficiency is a risk factor for LOAD [late-onset Alzheimer's disease] …" 42  Genetic conditions  A study of 818 heavy drinkers found that those exposed to more acetaldehyde than normal through a defect in the gene for acetaldehyde dehydrogenase are at greater risk of developing cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract and liver. 43  Disulfiram  The drug disulfiram (Antabuse) prevents the oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetic acid, and it has the same unpleasant effect on drinkers. Antabuse is sometimes used as a deterrent for alcoholics wishing to stay sober.  Sources of exposure  Indoor air  Acetaldehyde is common contaminant in workplace, indoors, and ambient environments. It is also a potential carcinogen. Moreover, humans spend more than 90% of their time in indoor environments, hence increasing any exposure and, as a consequence, the risk to human health. 44  In a study in France, the mean indoor concentration of acetaldehydes measured in 16 homes was approximately seven times higher than the outside acetaldehyde concentration. The living room had a mean of 18.1±17.5 μg m −3 and the bedroom was 18.2±16.9 μg m −3 , whereas the outdoor air had a mean concentration of 2.3±2.6 μg m −3 .  It has been concluded that VOCs such as benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, toluene, and xylenes have to be considered as priority pollutants with respect to their health effects. It has been pointed that in renovated or completely new buildings, the VOCs concentration levels are often several orders of magnitude higher. The main sources of acetaldehydes in homes include building materials, laminate, linoleum, wooden varnished, and cork/pine flooring. It is also found in plastic water-based and matt emulsion paints, in wood ceilings, and wooden, particle-board, plywood, pine wood, and chipboard furniture. 45  Outdoor air  The use of acetaldehyde is widespread in different industries, and it may be released into waste water or the air during production, use, transportation and storage. Sources of acetaldehyde include fuel combustion emissions from stationary internal combustion engines and power plants that burn fossil fuels, wood, or trash, oil and gas extraction, refineries, cement kilns, lumber and wood mills and paper mills. Acetaldehyde is also present in automobile and diesel exhaust. 46  Tobacco smoke  Acetaldehyde is a significant constituent of tobacco smoke. It has been demonstrated to have a synergistic effect with nicotine in rodent models of addiction. 47 48 Acetaldehyde is also the most abundant carcinogen in tobacco smoke; it is dissolved into the saliva while smoking.  Acetaldehyde can also be found in e-cigarette vapour, though this is reported to be trace amounts. 49  Cannabis smoke  Acetaldehyde has been found in cannabis smoke. This finding emerged through the use of new chemical techniques that demonstrated the acetaldehyde present was causing DNA damage in laboratory settings. 50  Alcohol consumption  Many microbes produce acetaldehyde from ethanol, but they have a lower capacity to eliminate the acetaldehyde, which can lead to the accumulation of acetaldehyde in saliva, stomach acid, and intestinal contents. Fermented food and many alcoholic beverages can also contain significant amounts of acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde, derived from mucosal or microbial oxidation of ethanol, tobacco smoke, and diet, appears to act as a cumulative carcinogen in the upper digestive tract of humans. 51 According to European Commission's Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety's (SCCS) "Opinion on Acetaldehyde" (2012) the cosmetic products special risk limit is 5 mg/l and acetaldehyde should not be used in mouth-washing products. 52  Plastics  Acetaldehyde is also created by thermal degradation or ultraviolet photo-degradation of some thermoplastic polymers during of after manufacture. One common example occurs when a bottle of water is left in a hot car for a few hours on a hot, sunny day, and one notices its strange sweet taste in the water from the breakdown of the polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) container. 53 The water industry generally recognizes 20–40 ppb as the taste/odor threshold for acetaldehyde. The level at which an average consumer could detect acetaldehyde is still considerably lower than any toxic amount. 54  See also   Wine fault  Alcohol dehydrogenase   References  External links   International Chemical Safety Card 0009  NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards  Methods for sampling and analysis  IARC Monograph: "Acetaldehyde"  Hal Kibbey, Genetic Influences on Alcohol Drinking and Alcoholism , Indiana University Research and Creative Activity, Vol. 17 no. 3.
