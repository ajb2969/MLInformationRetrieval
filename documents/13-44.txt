   Helical boundary conditions      Helical boundary conditions   In mathematics, helical boundary conditions are a variation on periodic boundary conditions . Helical boundary conditions provide a method for determining the index of a lattice site's neighbours when each lattice site is indexed by just a single coordinate. On a lattice of dimension d where the lattice sites are numbered from 1 to N and L is the width (i.e. number of elements per row) of the lattice in all but the last dimension, the neighbors of site i are:        (   i  ±  1   )   mod  N     modulo   plus-or-minus  i  1   N    (i\pm 1)\mod N          (   i  ±  L   )   mod  N     modulo   plus-or-minus  i  L   N    (i\pm L)\mod N        …   normal-…   \ldots          (   i  ±   L   d  -  1     )   mod  N     modulo   plus-or-minus  i   superscript  L    d  1     N    (i\pm L^{d-1})\mod N      It is not necessary that N = L d . Helical boundary conditions make it possible to use only one coordinate to describe arbitrary-dimensional lattices.  References   Monte Carlo Methods in Statistical Physics , Mark E. J. Newman, G. T.
