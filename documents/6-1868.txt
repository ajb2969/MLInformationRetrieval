   Weierstrass point      Weierstrass point   In mathematics , a Weierstrass point    P   P   P   on a nonsingular algebraic curve    C   C   C   defined over the complex numbers is a point such that there are more functions on   C   C   C   , with their poles restricted to   P   P   P   only, than would be predicted by the Riemann–Roch theorem . That is, looking at the vector spaces       L   (  0  )    ,   L   (  P  )    ,   L   (   2  P   )    ,   L   (   3  P   )    ,  …       L  0     L  P     L    2  P      L    3  P    normal-…    L(0),\ L(P),\ L(2P),\ L(3P),\ldots     where    L   (   k  P   )       L    k  P     L(kP)   is the space of meromorphic functions on   C   C   C   whose order at   P   P   P   is at least −   k   k   k   and with no other poles.  The concept is named after Karl Weierstrass .  We know three things: the dimension is at least 1, because of the constant functions on   C   C   C   , it is non-decreasing, and from the Riemann–Roch theorem the dimension eventually increments by exactly 1 as we move to the right. In fact if   g   g   g   is the genus of   C   C   C   , the dimension from the   k   k   k   -th term is known to be       l   (   k  P   )    =    k  -  g   +  1         l    k  P        k  g   1     l(kP)=k-g+1   , for    k  ≥  ;  2  g  -  1     fragments  k   normal-;  2  g   1    k\geq;2g-1   .  Our knowledge of the sequence is therefore   1, ?, ?, ..., ?, g , g + 1, g + 2, ... .   What we know about the ? entries is that they can increment by at most 1 each time (this is a simple argument: if   f   f   f   and   g   g   g   have the same order of pole at   P   P   P   , then    f  +   c  g       f    c  g     f+cg   will have a pole of lower order if the constant   c   c   c   is chosen to cancel the leading term). There are       2  g   -  2        2  g   2    2g-2     question marks here, so the cases    g  =  0      g  0    g=0   or   1   1   1   need no further discussion and do not give rise to Weierstrass points.  Assume therefore    g  ≥  2      g  2    g\geq 2   . There will be    g  -  1      g  1    g-1   steps up, and    g  -  1      g  1    g-1   steps where there is no increment. A non-Weierstrass point of   C   C   C   occurs whenever the increments are all as far to the right as possible: i.e. the sequence looks like   1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., g − 1, g , g + 1, ... .   Any other case is a Weierstrass point . A Weierstrass gap for   P   P   P   is a value of   k   k   k   such that no function on   C   C   C   has exactly a   k   k   k   -fold pole at   P   P   P   only. The gap sequence is      1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  g     1  2  normal-…  g    1,\ 2,\ \ldots,\ g     for a non-Weierstrass point. For a Weierstrass point it contains at least one higher number. (The Weierstrass gap theorem or Lückensatz is the statement that there must be   g   g   g   gaps.)  For hyperelliptic curves , for example, we may have a function   F   F   F   with a double pole at   P   P   P   only. Its powers have poles of order    4  ,  6     4  6    4,\ 6   and so on. Therefore such a   P   P   P   has the gap sequence   1, 3, 5, ..., 2 g − 1.   In general if the gap sequence is      a  ,  b  ,  c  ,  …     a  b  c  normal-…    a,\ b,\ c,\ \ldots     the weight of the Weierstrass point is       (   a  -  1   )   +   (   b  -  2   )   +   (   c  -  3   )   +  …        a  1     b  2     c  3   normal-…    (a-1)+(b-2)+(c-3)+\ldots     This is introduced because of a counting theorem: on a Riemann surface the sum of the weights of the Weierstrass points is      g   (    g  2   -  1   )       g     superscript  g  2   1     g(g^{2}-1)   .  For example a hyperelliptic Weierstrass point, as above, has weight g ( g − 1)/2. Therefore there are (at most) 2( g + 1) of them; as those can be found (for example, the six points of ramification when g = 2 and   C   C   C   is presented as a ramified covering of the projective line ) this exhausts all the Weierstrass points on   C   C   C   .  Further information on the gaps comes from applying Clifford's theorem . Multiplication of functions gives the non-gaps a semigroup structure , and an old question of Adolf Hurwitz asked for a characterization of the semigroups occurring. A new necessary condition was found by Buchweitz in 1980, and he gave an example of a subsemigroup of the nonnegative integers with 16 gaps that does not occur as the semigroup of non-gaps at a point on a curve of genus 16. A definition of Weierstrass point for a nonsingular curve over a field of positive characteristic was given by F. K. Schmidt in 1939.
