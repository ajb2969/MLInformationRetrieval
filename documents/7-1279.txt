   Total ring of fractions      Total ring of fractions   In abstract algebra , the total quotient ring , 1 or total ring of fractions , 2 is a construction that generalizes the notion of the field of fractions of an integral domain to commutative rings  R that may have zero divisors . The construction embeds R in a larger ring, giving every non-zero-divisor of R an inverse in the larger ring. Nothing more in A can be given an inverse, if one wants the homomorphism from A to the new ring to be injective.  Definition  Let   R   R   R   be a commutative ring and let   S   S   S   be the set of elements which are not zero divisors in   R   R   R   ; then   S   S   S   is a multiplicatively closed set . Hence we may localize the ring   R   R   R   at the set   S   S   S   to obtain the total quotient ring      S   -  1    R   =   Q   (  R  )           superscript  S    1    R     Q  R     S^{-1}R=Q(R)   .  If   R   R   R   is a domain , then    S  =   R  -   {  0  }        S    R   0      S=R-\{0\}   and the total quotient ring is the same as the field of fractions. This justifies the notation    Q   (  R  )       Q  R    Q(R)   , which is sometimes used for the field of fractions as well, since there is no ambiguity in the case of a domain.  Since   S   S   S   in the construction contains no zero divisors, the natural map    R  ‚Üí   Q   (  R  )       normal-‚Üí  R    Q  R     R\to Q(R)   is injective, so the total quotient ring is an extension of   R   R   R   .  Examples  The total quotient ring    Q   (   A  √ó  B   )       Q    A  B     Q(A\times B)   of a product ring is the product of total quotient rings      Q   (  A  )    √ó  Q    (  B  )           Q  A   Q   B    Q(A)\times Q(B)   . In particular, if A and B are integral domains, it is the product of quotient fields.  The total quotient ring of the ring of holomorphic functions on an open set D of complex numbers is the ring of meromorphic functions on D , even if D is not connected.  In an Artinian ring , all elements are units or zero divisors. Hence the set of non-zero divisors is the group of units of the ring,    R  √ó     superscript  R     R^{\times}   , and so     Q   (  R  )    =     (   R  √ó   )    -  1    R         Q  R      superscript   superscript  R      1    R     Q(R)=(R^{\times})^{-1}R   . But since all these elements already have inverses,     Q   (  R  )    =  R        Q  R   R    Q(R)=R   .  The same thing happens in a commutative von Neumann regular ring  R . Suppose a in R is not a zero divisor. Then in a von Neumann regular ring a = axa for some x in R , giving the equation a ( xa ‚àí¬†1)¬†=¬†0. Since a is not a zero divisor, xa =¬†1, showing a is a unit. Here again,     Q   (  R  )    =  R        Q  R   R    Q(R)=R   .   In algebraic geometry one considers a sheaf of total quotient rings on a scheme , and this may be used to give one possible definition of a Cartier divisor .   The total ring of fractions of a reduced ring  There is an important fact:  Proof: Apply the Chinese remainder theorem to Q ( A ) with the maximal ideals     ùî≠  i   Q   (  A  )        subscript  ùî≠  i   Q  A    \mathfrak{p}_{i}Q(A)   (note     ùî≠  i   Q   (  A  )        subscript  ùî≠  i   Q  A    \mathfrak{p}_{i}Q(A)   is maximal since if x in A is not in    ùî≠  i     subscript  ùî≠  i    \mathfrak{p}_{i}   , then it is a nonzerodivisor and so is a unit in Q ( A ).)   ‚ñ°   normal-‚ñ°   \square     Generalization  If   R   R   R   is a commutative ring and   S   S   S   is any multiplicative subset in   R   R   R   , the localization      S   -  1    R       superscript  S    1    R    S^{-1}R   can still be constructed, but the ring homomorphism from   R   R   R   to     S   -  1    R       superscript  S    1    R    S^{-1}R   might fail to be injective. For example, if    0  ‚àà  S      0  S    0\in S   , then     S   -  1    R       superscript  S    1    R    S^{-1}R   is the trivial ring.
