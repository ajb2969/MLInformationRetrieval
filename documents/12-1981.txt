   P-adically closed field      P-adically closed field   In mathematics , a p -adically closed field is a field that enjoys a closure property that is a close analogue for p -adic fields to what real closure is to the real field . They were introduced by James Ax and Simon B. Kochen in 1965. 1  Definition  Let K be the field ℚ of rational numbers and v be its usual p -adic  valuation (with     v   (  p  )    =  1        v  p   1    v(p)=1   ). If F is a (not necessarily algebraic) extension field of K , itself equipped with a valuation w , we say that    (  F  ,  w  )     F  w    (F,w)   is formally p -adic when the following conditions are satisfied:   w extends v (that is,     w   (  x  )    =   v   (  x  )          w  x     v  x     w(x)=v(x)   for all x in K ),  the residue field of w coincides with the residue field of v (the residue field being the quotient of the valuation ring    {   x  ∈  F   :    w   (  x  )    ≥  0   }     conditional-set    x  F       w  x   0     \{x\in F:w(x)\geq 0\}   by its maximal ideal     {   x  ∈  F   :    w   (  x  )    >  0   }     conditional-set    x  F       w  x   0     \{x\in F:w(x)>0\}   ),  the smallest positive value of w coincides with the smallest positive value of v (namely 1, since v was assumed to be normalized): in other words, a uniformizer for K remains a uniformizer for F .   (Note that the value group of K may be larger than that of F since it may contain infinitely large elements over the latter.)  The formally p -adic fields can be viewed as an analogue of the formally real fields.  For example, the field ℚ(i) of Gaussian rationals , if equipped with the valuation w given by     w   (   2  +  i   )    =  1        w    2  i    1    w(2+i)=1   (and     w   (   2  -  i   )    =  0        w    2  i    0    w(2-i)=0   ) is formally 5-adic (the place v =5 of the rationals splits in two places of the Gaussian rationals since     X  2   +  1       superscript  X  2   1    X^{2}+1   factors over the residue field with 5 elements, and w is one of these places). The field of 5-adic numbers (which contains both the rationals and the Gaussian rationals embedded as per the place w ) is also formally 5-adic. On the other hand, the field of Gaussian rationals is not formally 3-adic for any valuation, because the only valuation w on it which extends the 3-adic valuation is given by     w   (  3  )    =  1        w  3   1    w(3)=1   and its residue field has 9 elements.  When F is formally p -adic but that there does not exist any proper algebraic formally p -adic extension of F , then F is said to be p -adically closed . For example, the field of p -adic numbers is p -adically closed, and so is the algebraic closure of the rationals inside it (the field of p -adic algebraic numbers).  If F is p -adically closed, then: 2   there is a unique valuation w on F which makes F  p -adically closed (so it is legitimate to say that F , rather than the pair    (  F  ,  w  )     F  w    (F,w)   , is p -adically closed),  F is Henselian with respect to this place (that is, its valuation ring is so),  the valuation ring of F is exactly the image of the Kochen operator (see below ),  the value group of F is an extension by ℤ (the value group of K ) of a divisible group, with the lexicographical order .   The first statement is an analogue of the fact that the order of a real-closed field is uniquely determined by the algebraic structure.  The definitions given above can be copied to a more general context: if K is a field equipped with a valuation v such that   the residue field of K is finite (call q its cardinal and p its characteristic),  the value group of v admits a smallest positive element (call it 1, and say π is a uniformizer, i.e.     v   (  π  )    =  1        v  π   1    v(\pi)=1   ),  K has finite absolute ramification, i.e.,    v   (  p  )       v  p    v(p)   is finite (that is, a finite multiple of     v   (  π  )    =  1        v  π   1    v(\pi)=1   ),   (these hypotheses are satisfied for the field of rationals, with q =π= p the prime number having valuation 1) then we can speak of formally v -adic fields (or   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   -adic if   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   is the ideal corresponding to v ) and v -adically complete fields.  The Kochen operator  If K is a field equipped with a valuation v satisfying the hypothesis and with the notations introduced in the previous paragraph, define the Kochen operator by:       γ   (  z  )    =     1  π       z  q   -  z      (    z  q   -  z   )   2   -  1           γ  z       1  π        superscript  z  q   z      superscript     superscript  z  q   z   2   1       \gamma(z)=\frac{1}{\pi}\,\frac{z^{q}-z}{(z^{q}-z)^{2}-1}   (when      z  q   -  z   ≠   ±  1          superscript  z  q   z    plus-or-minus  1     z^{q}-z\neq\pm 1   ). It is easy to check that    γ   (  z  )       γ  z    \gamma(z)   always has non-negative valuation. The Kochen operator can be thought of as a p -adic (or v -adic) analogue of the square function in the real case.  An extension field F of K is formally v -adic if and only if    1  π      1  π    \frac{1}{\pi}   does not belong to the subring generated over the value ring of K by the image of the Kochen operator on F . This is an analogue of the statement (or definition) that a field is formally real when    -  1      1    -1   is not a sum of squares.  First-order theory  The first-order theory of p -adically closed fields (here we are restricting ourselves to the p -adic case, i.e., K is the field of rationals and v is the p -adic valuation) is complete and model complete , and if we slightly enrich the language it admits quantifier elimination . Thus, one can define p -adically closed fields as those whose first-order theory is elementarily equivalent to that of    ℚ  p     subscript  ℚ  p    \mathbb{Q}_{p}   .
