<p>He was born in <a class="uri" href="Novara" title="wikilink">Novara</a> on 18 July 1856, the son of <strong>Giacomo Morera</strong> and <strong>Vittoria Unico</strong>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> According to , his family was a wealthy one, his father being a rich <a class="uri" href="merchant" title="wikilink">merchant</a>. This occurrence eased him in his studies after the <a class="uri" href="laurea" title="wikilink">laurea</a>:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> however, he was an extraordinarily hard worker and he widely used this ability in his researches.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> After studying in <a class="uri" href="Turin" title="wikilink">Turin</a> he went to <a class="uri" href="Pavia" title="wikilink">Pavia</a>, <a class="uri" href="Pisa" title="wikilink">Pisa</a> and <a class="uri" href="Leipzig" title="wikilink">Leipzig</a>: then he went back to <a class="uri" href="Pavia" title="wikilink">Pavia</a> for a brief period in 1885, and finally he went to <a class="uri" href="Genova" title="wikilink">Genova</a> in 1886, living here for the next 15 years. While being in <a class="uri" href="Genova" title="wikilink">Genova</a> he married his fellow-citizen <strong>Cesira Faà</strong>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> From 1901 on to his death he worked in <a class="uri" href="Turin" title="wikilink">Turin</a>:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> he died of <a class="uri" href="pneumonia" title="wikilink">pneumonia</a> on 8 February 1909.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>In his commemorative papers, <a href="Carlo_Somigliana" title="wikilink">Carlo Somigliana</a> describes extensively Morera's personality:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> according to him, he was a devoted friend and precious colleague,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> capable of serenely judging men and facts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> On the very personal level, he remembers him s a cheerful person and a witty talker.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>His intelligence is described as sharp and penetrating,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> his mind as uncommonly lucid,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> himself as possessing analytic and critical abilities and being versatile, capable to grasp and appreciate every kind of manifestation of the human intellect.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Nevertheless, Somigliana also states that he was not interested in any scientific or other kind of <a href="Field_of_study" title="wikilink">field</a> outside of his own realm of expertise.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a>  himself, in the inaugural address as the rector of the University of Genova, after quoting a statement attributed to <a href="Peter_Guthrie_Tait" title="wikilink">Peter Guthrie Tait</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> revealed the reason behind his views:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> "<em>In science, the one who has a sound and solid knowledge, even in a narrow field, holds a true strength and he can use it whenever he needs: the one who has only a superficial knowledge, however wide and striking, holds nothing, and indeed he often holds a weakness pushing him towards <a class="uri" href="vanity" title="wikilink">vanity</a></em>".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>Acknowledged as honest, loyal and conscientious,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> good-tempered and with a good intellect,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> his simple manners earned him affection even when performing the duties of dean and rector at the <a href="University_of_Genoa" title="wikilink">University of Genoa</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Also  describes him as a man of high moral value, and ascribes to such qualities the reason of his success in <a href="social_relation" title="wikilink">social relations</a> and in performing his duties as a civil servant.</p>

<p>However, despite of being successful in social relations, he did not cured nor appreciated much appearances and was not interested in activities other than teaching and doing research: consequently, he was not well known outside the circle of his family and relatives and the circle of his colleagues.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He did not make a display of himself, careless of being not acknowledged by everyone for his true value: he also had a serious conception of life and strongly disliked vanity and superficiality.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>According to Somigliana,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> his entire life was devoted to the higher unselfish ideal of <em><a href="scientific_research" title="wikilink">scientific research</a></em>: and  also remarks that only his beloved family shared the same attentions and cares he reserved to his life–long ideal.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<h3 id="research-activity">Research activity</h3>

<p>According to Somigliana,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> he was not particularly inventive: he did not create any new theory since this was not his main ability.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Instead, he perfected already developed theories:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> nearly all of his researches appear as the natural result of a deep analysis work on theories that have already reached a high degree of perfection,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> clearly and precisely exposed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> He had an exquisite sense for the applicability of his work, derived from his engineering studies,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and mastered perfectly all known branches of <a href="mathematical_analysis" title="wikilink">mathematical analysis</a> and their <a href="Mechanics" title="wikilink">mechanical</a> and <a href="Physics" title="wikilink">physical</a> applications.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p>He authored more than 60 research works: nearly complete lists of his publications are included in the commemorative papers ,  and .
