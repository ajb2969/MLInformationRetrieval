Class kappa function

In control theory, it is often required to check if a nonautonomous system is stable or not. To cope with this it is necessary to use some special  comparison functions. Class 
 
 
 
  functions belong to this family:
Definition: a continuous function 
 
 
 
  is said to belong to class 
 
 
 
  if:

it is strictly increasing;
it is s.t. 
 
 
 
 
 .
