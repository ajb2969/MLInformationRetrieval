   Class kappa function      Class kappa function   In control theory , it is often required to check if a nonautonomous system is stable or not. To cope with this it is necessary to use some special comparison functions . Class   𝒦   𝒦   \mathcal{K}   functions belong to this family:  Definition : a continuous function    α  :    [  0  ,  a  )   →   [  0  ,  ∞  )       normal-:  α   normal-→   0  a    0       \alpha:[0,a)\rightarrow[0,\infty)   is said to belong to class   𝒦   𝒦   \mathcal{K}   if:   it is strictly increasing;  it is s.t.     α   (  0  )    =  0        α  0   0    \alpha(0)=0   .   Definition : a continuous function    α  :    [  0  ,  a  )   →   [  0  ,  ∞  )       normal-:  α   normal-→   0  a    0       \alpha:[0,a)\rightarrow[0,\infty)   is said to belong to class    𝒦  ∞     subscript  𝒦     \mathcal{K}_{\infty}   if:   it belongs to class   𝒦   𝒦   \mathcal{K}   ;  it is s.t.    a  =  ∞      a     a=\infty   ;  it is s.t.      lim   r  →  ∞     α   (  r  )     =  ∞        subscript    normal-→  r       α  r       \lim_{r\rightarrow\infty}\alpha(r)=\infty   .
