   Camphor 1,2-monooxygenase      Camphor 1,2-monooxygenase   In enzymology , a camphor 1,2-monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (+)-bornane-2,5-dione + reduced rubredoxin + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-oxo-1,2-campholide + oxidized rubredoxin + H 2 O   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (+)-bornane-2,5-dione , reduced rubredoxin , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 5-oxo-1,2-campholide , oxidized rubredoxin , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with reduced iron-sulfur protein as one donor, and incorporation o one atom of oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (+)-camphor,reduced-rubredoxin:oxygen oxidoreductase (1,2-lactonizing) . Other names in common use include 2,5-diketocamphane lactonizing enzyme , camphor ketolactonase I , oxygenase, camphor 1,2-mono , and ketolactonase I . It employs one cofactor , iron .
