   Multicategory      Multicategory   In mathematics (especially category theory ), a multicategory is a generalization of the concept of category that allows morphisms of multiple arity . If morphisms in a category are viewed as analogous to functions , then morphisms in a multicategory are analogous to functions of several variables.  Definition  A multicategory consists of   a collection (often a proper class ) of objects ;  for every finite sequence      (   X  i   )    i  ∈  n      subscript   subscript  X  i     i  n     (X_{i})_{i\in n}   of objects (for von Neumann ordinal    n  ∈  ℕ      n  ℕ    n\in\mathbb{N}   ) and object Y , a set of morphisms from     (   X  i   )    i  ∈  n      subscript   subscript  X  i     i  n     (X_{i})_{i\in n}   to Y ; and  for every object X , a special identity morphism (with n = 1) from X to X .   Additionally, there are composition operations: Given a sequence of sequences     (    (   X   i  j    )    i  ∈   n  j     )    j  ∈  m      subscript   subscript   subscript  X    i  j      i   subscript  n  j       j  m     ((X_{ij})_{i\in n_{j}})_{j\in m}   of objects, a sequence     (   Y  i   )    i  ∈  m      subscript   subscript  Y  i     i  m     (Y_{i})_{i\in m}   of objects, and an object Z : if   for each    j  ∈  m      j  m    j\in m   , f j is a morphism from     (   X   i  j    )    i  ∈   n  j       subscript   subscript  X    i  j      i   subscript  n  j      (X_{ij})_{i\in n_{j}}   to Y j ; and  g is a morphism from     (   Y  i   )    i  ∈  m      subscript   subscript  Y  i     i  m     (Y_{i})_{i\in m}   to Z :   then there is a composite morphism    g    (   f  i   )    i  ∈  m        g   subscript   subscript  f  i     i  m      g(f_{i})_{i\in m}   from     (   X   i  j    )     i  ∈   n  j    ,   j  ∈  m       subscript   subscript  X    i  j     formulae-sequence    i   subscript  n  j      j  m      (X_{ij})_{i\in n_{j},j\in m}   to Z . This must satisfy certain axioms:   If m = 1, Z = Y 0 , and g is the identity morphism for Y 0 , then g ( f 0 ) = f 0 ;  if for each    i  ∈  m      i  m    i\in m   , n i = 1,     X   0  i    =   Y  i        subscript  X    0  i     subscript  Y  i     X_{0i}=Y_{i}   , and f i is the identity morphism for Y i , then     g    (   f  i   )    i  ∈  m     =  g        g   subscript   subscript  f  i     i  m     g    g(f_{i})_{i\in m}=g   ; and  an associativity condition: if for each    k  ∈  m      k  m    k\in m   and    j  ∈   n  k       j   subscript  n  k     j\in n_{k}   ,    e   j  k      subscript  e    j  k     e_{jk}   is a morphism from     (   W   i  j  k    )    i  ∈   o   j  k        subscript   subscript  W    i  j  k      i   subscript  o    j  k       (W_{ijk})_{i\in o_{jk}}   to    X   j  k      subscript  X    j  k     X_{jk}   , then     g    (    f  j     (   e   i  j    )    i  ∈   n  j      )    j  ∈  m     =   g    (   f  i   )    i  ∈  m      (   e   i  j    )     i  ∈   n  j    ,   j  ∈  m            g   subscript     subscript  f  j    subscript   subscript  e    i  j      i   subscript  n  j        j  m       g   subscript   subscript  f  i     i  m     subscript   subscript  e    i  j     formulae-sequence    i   subscript  n  j      j  m        g\left(f_{j}(e_{ij})_{i\in n_{j}}\right)_{j\in m}=g(f_{i})_{i\in m}(e_{ij})_{i%
 \in n_{j},j\in m}   are identical morphisms from     (   W   i  j  k    )     i  ∈   o   j  k     ,    j  ∈   n  k    ,   k  ∈  m        subscript   subscript  W    i  j  k     formulae-sequence    i   subscript  o    j  k      formulae-sequence    j   subscript  n  k      k  m       (W_{ijk})_{i\in o_{jk},j\in n_{k},k\in m}   to Z .   Examples  There is a multicategory whose objects are (small) sets , where a morphism from the sets X 1 , X 2 , ..., and X n to the set Y is an n -ary function , that is a function from the Cartesian product  X 1 × X 2 × ... × X n to Y .  There is a multicategory whose objects are vector spaces (over the rational numbers , say), where a morphism from the vector spaces X 1 , X 2 , ..., and X n to the vector space Y is a multilinear operator , that is a linear transformation from the tensor product  X 1 ⊗ X 2 ⊗ ... ⊗ X n to Y .  More generally, given any monoidal category  C , there is a multicategory whose objects are objects of C , where a morphism from the C -objects X 1 , X 2 , ..., and X n to the C -object Y is a C -morphism from the monoidal product of X 1 , X 2 , ..., and X n to Y .  An operad is a multicategory with one unique object; except in degenerate cases, such a multicategory does not come from a monoidal category. (The term "operad" is often reserved for symmetric multicategories; terminology varies. 1 )  References     "  Category:Category theory
