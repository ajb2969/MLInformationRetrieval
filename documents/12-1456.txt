   Jaffe profile      Jaffe profile   The Jaffe profile (or Jaffe model) is a mathematical function that is used to describe the distribution of mass or light in elliptical galaxies and the bulges of spiral galaxies . It was proposed by Walter Jaffe in 1983. 1 Its usefulness derives from the fact that it accurately reproduces a de Vaucouleurs profile when projected onto the sky.  The density in the Jaffe model is given by        ρ   (  r  )    =     ρ  0    4  π      (   r   r  0    )    -  2      (   1  +   r   r  0     )    -  2      .        ρ  r        subscript  ρ  0     4  π     superscript    r   subscript  r  0      2     superscript    1    r   subscript  r  0       2       \rho(r)={\rho_{0}\over 4\pi}\left({r\over r_{0}}\right)^{-2}\left(1+{r\over r_%
 {0}}\right)^{-2}.     In this equation,    ρ  0     subscript  ρ  0    \rho_{0}   and    r  0     subscript  r  0    r_{0}   are parameters that can be varied to fit the observed density.  Jaffe described how he arrived at his model: 2   [The formula] was derived heuristically from the observation that the brightness profiles of spherical galaxies seem to run as    r   -  3      superscript  r    3     r^{-3}   and    r   -  1      superscript  r    1     r^{-1}   in at least some parts of their envelopes and cores, respectively. This would imply that the spatial density runs as    r   -  4      superscript  r    4     r^{-4}   and    r   -  2      superscript  r    2     r^{-2}   .   Variations on Jaffe's law include the Hernquist profile , the Dehnen profile and the NFW profile , which have a similar functional form as Jaffe's law but which use different values for the two exponents.
