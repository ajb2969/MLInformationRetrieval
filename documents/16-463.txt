Symmetry constructions  There are 3 different symmetry constructions, all with 3-3 duopyramid vertex figures. The     B  ~   4     subscript   normal-~  B   4    {\tilde{B}}_{4}   symmetry doubles on     D  ~   4     subscript   normal-~  D   4    {\tilde{D}}_{4}   in three possible ways, while     F  ~   4     subscript   normal-~  F   4    {\tilde{F}}_{4}   contains the highest symmetry.
