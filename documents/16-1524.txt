   Draft:Bertheau's law      Draft:Bertheau's law   Bertheau's law is an extension to Brooks's law which considers "the communication breakdowns attributed to a remote team and the actual items that make remoteness an issue for software development team effectiveness". 1 It has been created by product development consultant Tim Bertheau while working in New Zealand. 2 The law allows to calculate the total cost of remote software development teams and is concerned with the quality of communications through pathways defined by Fred Brooks .  Outsourcing  Bertheau’s law provides a formula for software development companies to quantify total cost of ownership when working with either internal or external remote teams. Since 1975 when The Mythical Man-Month was released, outsourcing software development to remote teams has become very common. The law cen be used to see implications of such operations thus actual tradeoffs can be understood and made.  Application  Bertheau’s law formula calculates communication disturbances (C) with an exponent value applied based on the number of communication complexity barriers (X) present in a project.      C  =    (    n   (   n  -  1   )    2   )    1.  X        C   superscript      n    n  1    2     1.  X      C=(\frac{n(n-1)}{2})^{1.X}     Maximum number of communication complexity barriers is 3 and they can be as follows: 3   Physical remoteness; and  Time offset; and  Cultural difference.   Communication Complexity Barriers  CCBs are the core elements used to determine the degree of communication experienced by a software development team. Physical remoteness is an actual impediment to communication when doing software development. Tim Bertheu describes the ideal situation as "where the development team members and the product owner have immediate and ad hoc/at will direct access to each other". He also suggests that if "a team is separated by more than three hours then there is a negative time offset component to the structure of the project and the team suffers a CCB time offset condition". Moreover, cultural difference condition occurs when "30% of the team is not from the same geographical region, defined as culturally same, not similar but same".  Remote Team Inefficiences  Bertheau's law stipulates that when there are no communication complexity barriers, Brooks' law applies. However, if a team is in a situation where even one of the mentioned CCBs are present, that drastically alters efficiency team communication and which "is the root cause of reduction in quality of product delivery measured in terms of; product fitness, product quality, product delivery, and product cost". Tim Bertheau suggests that if the number of communication distrubances according to formula is over 100, such software development project should not be attempted.  References  4 5 "     ↩  ↩
