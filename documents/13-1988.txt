Stieltjes–Wigert polynomials

In mathematics, Stieltjes–Wigert polynomials (named after Thomas Jan Stieltjes and Carl Severin Wigert) are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme, for the weight function 1


 
  on the positive real line x > 0.
The moment problem for the Stieltjes–Wigert polynomials is indeterminate; in other words, there are many other measures giving the same family of orthogonal polynomials (see Krein's condition).
Koekoek et al. (2010) give in Section 14.27 a detailed list of the properties of these polynomials.
Definition
The polynomials are given in terms of basic hypergeometric functions and the Pochhammer symbol by2


 
  (where q = e).
Orthogonality
Since the moment problem for these polynomials is indeterminate there are many different weight functions on [0,∞] for which they are orthogonal. Two examples of such weight functions are


 
  and
