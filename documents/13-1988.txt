   Stieltjes–Wigert polynomials      Stieltjes–Wigert polynomials   In mathematics, Stieltjes–Wigert polynomials (named after Thomas Jan Stieltjes and Carl Severin Wigert ) are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme , for the weight function 1       w   (  x  )    =    k   π     x   -   1  /  2      exp   (   -    k  2     log  2   x     )           w  x       k    π     superscript  x      1  2            superscript  k  2     superscript   2   x         w(x)=\frac{k}{\sqrt{\pi}}x^{-1/2}\exp(-k^{2}\log^{2}x)   on the positive real line x > 0.  The moment problem for the Stieltjes–Wigert polynomials is indeterminate; in other words, there are many other measures giving the same family of orthogonal polynomials (see Krein's condition ).  Koekoek et al. (2010) give in Section 14.27 a detailed list of the properties of these polynomials.  Definition  The polynomials are given in terms of basic hypergeometric functions and the Pochhammer symbol by 2        S  n    (  x  ;  q  )    =    1     (  q  ;  q  )   n   )     ϕ  1    1     (   q   -  n    ,  0  ;  q  ,   -    q   n  +  1    x    )           subscript  S  n    x  q        1   fragments   subscript   fragments  normal-(  q  normal-;  q  normal-)   n   normal-)     subscript   subscript  ϕ  1   1     superscript  q    n    0  q       superscript  q    n  1    x        \displaystyle S_{n}(x;q)=\frac{1}{(q;q)_{n})}{}_{1}\phi_{1}(q^{-n},0;q,-q^{n+1%
 }x)   (where q = e ).  Orthogonality  Since the moment problem for these polynomials is indeterminate there are many different weight functions on [0,∞] for which they are orthogonal. Two examples of such weight functions are      1    (   -  x   ,   -   q   x   -  1      ;  q  )   ∞       1   subscript     x       q   superscript  x    1      q       \frac{1}{(-x,-qx^{-1};q)_{\infty}}   and       k   π     x   -   1  /  2      exp   (   -    k  2     log  2   x     )          k    π     superscript  x      1  2            superscript  k  2     superscript   2   x        \frac{k}{\sqrt{\pi}}x^{-1/2}\exp(-k^{2}\log^{2}x)     Notes  References          "  Category:Orthogonal polynomials  Category:Special hypergeometric functions     Up to a constant factor this is w ( q −1/2 x ) for the weight function w in Szegő (1975), Section 2.7.
