Hasse derivative

In mathematics, the Hasse derivative is a derivation, a generalisation of the derivative which allows the formulation of Taylor's theorem in coordinate rings of algebraic varieties.
Definition
Let k[X] be a polynomial ring over a field k. The r-th Hasse derivative of Xn is



if n â‰¥ r and zero otherwise.1 In characteristic zero we have



Properties
The Hasse derivative is a derivation on k[X] and extends to a derivation on the function field k(X),2 satisfying the product rule and the chain rule.3
A form of Taylor's theorem holds for a function f defined in terms of a local parameter t on an algebraic variety:4
