   Hörmander's condition      Hörmander's condition   In mathematics , Hörmander's condition is a property of vector fields that, if satisfied, has many useful consequences in the theory of partial and stochastic differential equations . The condition is named after the Swedish  mathematician  Lars Hörmander .  Definition  Given two C 1 vector fields  V and W on d - dimensional  Euclidean space  R d , let [ V , W ] denote their Lie bracket , another vector field defined by         [  V  ,  W  ]    (  x  )    =    D  V   (  x  )   W   (  x  )    -   D  W   (  x  )   V   (  x  )      ,         V  W   x       normal-D  V  x  W  x     normal-D  W  x  V  x      [V,W](x)=\mathrm{D}V(x)W(x)-\mathrm{D}W(x)V(x),     where D V ( x ) denotes the Fréchet derivative of V at x ∈ R d , which can be thought of as a matrix that is applied to the vector W ( x ), and vice versa .  Let A 0 , A 1 , ... A n be vector fields on R d . They are said to satisfy Hörmander's condition if, for every point x ∈ R d , the vectors             A   ;   j  0     (  x  )   ,          [    A   j  0     (  x  )    ,    A   j  1     (  x  )    ]   ,          [   [    A   j  0     (  x  )    ,    A   j  1     (  x  )    ]   ,    A   j  2     (  x  )    ]   ,         ⋮      0   ≤   j  0    ,     j  1   ,  …  ,   j  n    ≤  n      formulae-sequence        missing-subexpression    fragments  A   subscript  normal-;   subscript  j  0     fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-,      missing-subexpression       subscript  A   subscript  j  0    x      subscript  A   subscript  j  1    x       missing-subexpression        subscript  A   subscript  j  0    x      subscript  A   subscript  j  1    x       subscript  A   subscript  j  2    x       missing-subexpression   normal-⋮    0    subscript  j  0        subscript  j  1   normal-…   subscript  j  n    n     \begin{aligned}&\displaystyle A;_{j_{0}}(x)~{},\\

 n     span  R d . They are said to satisfy the parabolic Hörmander condition if the same holds true, but with the index    j  0     subscript  j  0    j_{0}   taking only values in 1,...,n.  Now consider the stochastic differential equation       d  x   =     V  0    (  x  )   d  t   +    ∑   i  =  1   m       V  i    (  x  )    ∘  d    W  i            d  x        subscript  V  0   x  d  t     superscript   subscript     i  1    m          subscript  V  i   x   d    subscript  W  i        dx=V_{0}(x)\;dt+\sum_{i=1}^{m}V_{i}(x)\circ dW_{i}   where the vectors fields are assumed to have bounded derivative. Hörmander's theorem asserts that if the SDE above satisfies the parabolic Hörmander condition, then its solutions admit a smooth density with respect to Lebesgue measure.  Application to the Cauchy problem  With the same notation as above, define a second-order differential operator  F by       F  =     1  2     ∑   i  =  1   n    A  i  2     +   A  0     .      F        1  2     superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript   subscript  A  i   2      subscript  A  0      F=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}A_{i}^{2}+A_{0}.     An important problem in the theory of partial differential equations is to determine sufficient conditions on the vector fields A i for the Cauchy problem      {          ∂  u    ∂  t     (  t  ,  x  )    =   F  u   (  t  ,  x  )     ,        t  >  0   ,   x  ∈   𝐑  d     ;          u   (  t  ,  ⋅  )    →  f   ,        as  t   →  0   ;         cases          u     t     t  x      F  u   t  x      formulae-sequence    t  0     x   superscript  𝐑  d      normal-→    u   t  normal-⋅    f    normal-→    as  t   0     \begin{cases}\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial t}(t,x)=Fu(t,x),&t>0,x\in\mathbf{R}^{%

It had been known for some time that a smooth solution exists in the elliptic case, in which        A  i   =    ∑   j  =  1   d     a   j  i     ∂   ∂   x  j        ,       subscript  A  i     superscript   subscript     j  1    d      subscript  a    j  i          subscript  x  j         A_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{d}a_{ji}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{j}},     and the matrix A = ( a ji ), 1 ≤ j ≤ d , 1 ≤ i ≤ n is such that AA ∗ is everywhere an invertible matrix .  The great achievement of Hörmander's 1967 paper was to show that a smooth fundamental solution exists under a considerably weaker assumption: the parabolic version of the condition that now bears his name.
