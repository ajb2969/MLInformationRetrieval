   O-demethylpuromycin O-methyltransferase      O-demethylpuromycin O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , an O-demethylpuromycin O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + O-demethylpuromycin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + puromycin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and O-demethylpuromycin , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and puromycin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:O-demethylpuromycin O-methyltransferase . This enzyme is also called O-demethylpuromycin methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in puromycin biosynthesis .  References     "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
