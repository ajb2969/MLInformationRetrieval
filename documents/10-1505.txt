L-lysine oxidase

In enzymology, a L-lysine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-lysine + O2 + H2O 
 
 
 
  6-amino-2-oxohexanoate + NH3 + H2O2


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-lysine, O2, and H2O, whereas its 3 products are 6-amino-2-oxohexanoate, NH3, and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-lysine:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase (deaminating). Other names in common use include L-lysine alpha-oxidase, and L-lysyl-alpha-oxidase. This enzyme participates in lysine degradation.
