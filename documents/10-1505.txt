   L-lysine oxidase      L-lysine oxidase   In enzymology , a L-lysine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-lysine + O 2 + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   6-amino-2-oxohexanoate + NH 3 + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-lysine , O 2 , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are 6-amino-2-oxohexanoate , NH 3 , and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-lysine:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase (deaminating) . Other names in common use include L-lysine alpha-oxidase , and L-lysyl-alpha-oxidase . This enzyme participates in lysine degradation .  References      "  Category:EC 1.4.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
