   Nurgaliev's law      Nurgaliev's law   In population dynamics , Nurgaliev's law is an equation that describes the rate of change of the size of a population at a given time, in terms of the current population size. It is a deterministic ordinary differential equation in which the rate of change is expressed as a quadratic function of the population size.  Specification  Nurgaliev's law is expressed as         d  n    d  t    =    a   n  2    -   b  n     ,          d  n     d  t        a   superscript  n  2      b  n      {dn\over dt}=an^{2}-bn,     where 'n' is the size of a population, t is time measured in years, a is a half of the average probability of a birth of a male (the same for females) of a potential arbitrary parents pair within a year, b is an average probability of a death of a person within a year.  The first term is twice proportional to the half of population (number of males and number of females). The second term is responsible for death rate and has a clear and precise senseâ€” death rates are constant in time but vary with position on the age scale (babies are at risk at birth, the middle aged are at risk of trauma , old men become ill). It is known to demographers , for example, that the probability of death within the first year of a life is precisely equal to similar probability for the 55th year of a life. Thus, in the given model, the average person dies under the same law as an unstable atomic nucleus decays.  Stability  The population has steady states at    n  =   0  ,   b  /  a        n   0    b  a      n=0,b/a   . The state with    n  =  0      n  0    n=0   is stable whereas the state with    n  =   b  /  a       n    b  a     n=b/a   is unstable, meaning that the equation describes a population which crashes (tends to zero) when the death rate is greater than the birth rate and explodes (tends to infinity) when it is the birth rate that is greater.
