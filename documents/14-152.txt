   Dwork family      Dwork family   In algebraic geometry , a Dwork family is a one-parameter family of hypersurfaces depending on an integer n , studied by Bernard Dwork . Originally considered by Dwork in the context of local zeta-functions , such families have been shown to have relationships with mirror symmetry and extensions of the modularity theorem . 1  Definition  The Dwork family is        x  1  n   +   x  2  n   +  ⋯  +   x  n  n    =   -   n  λ   x  1    x  2   ⋯    x  n             superscript   subscript  x  1   n    superscript   subscript  x  2   n   normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  x  n   n        n  λ   subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-⋯   subscript  x  n       x_{1}^{n}+x_{2}^{n}+\cdots+x_{n}^{n}=-n\lambda x_{1}x_{2}\cdots x_{n}\,     References     "  Category:Algebraic geometry     http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2007-44-04/S0273-0979-07-01178-0/S0273-0979-07-01178-0.pdf , p. 545. ↩
