   Euclid's lemma      Euclid's lemma   In number theory , Euclid's lemma is a lemma that captures a fundamental property of prime numbers , namely: If a prime divides the product of two numbers, it must divide at least one of those numbers. It is also called Euclid's first theorem 1 2 although that name more properly belongs to the side-angle-side condition for showing that triangles are congruent . 3 For example, 133 × 143 = 19019, and since 19019 is divisible by 19, the lemma implies that one or both of 133 or 143 must be as well. In fact, 133 ÷ 19 = 7.  This property is the key 4 in the proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic . It is used to define prime elements , a generalization of prime numbers to arbitrary commutative rings .  The lemma is not true for composite numbers . For example, 4 does not divide 6 and 4 does not divide 10, yet 4 does divide their product, 60.  Formulations  Let p be a prime number , and assume p divides the product of two integers a and b . (In symbols this is written p | ab . Its negation, p does not divide ab is written p ∤ ab .) Then p | a or p | b (or both).  Equivalent statements are  If p ∤ a and p ∤ b , then p ∤ ab . If p ∤ a and p | ab , then p | b .  A generalization is also called Euclid's lemma:  If n | ab , and n is relatively prime to a , then n | b . This is a generalization because if n is prime, either   n | a or  n is relatively prime to a . In this second possibility, n ∤ a so n | b .   History  The lemma first appears as proposition 30 in Book VII of Euclid 's Elements . It is included in practically every book that covers elementary number theory. 5 6 7 8 9  Proof via Bézout's identity  The usual proof involves another lemma called Bézout's identity . This states that if x and y are relatively prime integers (i.e. they share no common divisors other than 1) there exist integers r and s such that        r  x   +   s  y    =  1.          r  x     s  y    1.    rx+sy=1.   Let a and n be relatively prime, and assume that n | ab . By Bézout, there are r and s making        r  n   +   s  a    =  1.          r  n     s  a    1.    rn+sa=1.   Multiply both sides by b :         r  n  b   +   s  a  b    =  b   .          r  n  b     s  a  b    b    rnb+sab=b.   The first term on the left is divisible by n , and the second term is divisible by ab which by hypothesis is divisible by n . Therefore their sum, b , is also divisible by n . This is the generalization of Euclid's lemma mentioned above.
