   Cluster decomposition theorem      Cluster decomposition theorem   In physics , the cluster decomposition property is related to locality in quantum field theory . In a quantum field theory having this property, the vacuum expectation value of a product of many operators - each of them being either in region A or in region B where A and B are very separated - asymptotically equals the product of the expectation value of the product of the operators in A, times a similar factor from the region B. Consequently, sufficiently separated regions behave independently.  If A 1 , ..., A n are n operators each localized in a bounded region and    U   (  a  )       U  a    U(a)   represents the unitary operator  actively translating the Hilbert space by the vector a, then if we pick some subset of the n operators to translate,         lim    |  a  |   →  ∞     ⟨  Ω  |    A  1  ′   ⋯   A  n  ′    |  Ω  ⟩    -    ⟨  Ω  |    ∏  unshifted i    A  i    |  Ω  ⟩    ⟨  Ω  |    ∏  shifted i    U   (  a  )    A  i    U   -  1     (  a  )     |  Ω  ⟩     =  0          subscript    normal-→    a       quantum-operator-product  normal-Ω     subscript   superscript  A  normal-′   1   normal-⋯   subscript   superscript  A  normal-′   n    normal-Ω       quantum-operator-product  normal-Ω    subscript  product  unshifted i    subscript  A  i    normal-Ω    quantum-operator-product  normal-Ω    subscript  product  shifted i     U  a   subscript  A  i    superscript  U    1    a    normal-Ω     0    \lim_{|a|\rightarrow\infty}\langle\Omega|A^{\prime}_{1}\cdots A^{\prime}_{n}|%
 \Omega\rangle-\langle\Omega|\prod_{\mbox{unshifted i}}A_{i}|\Omega\rangle%
 \langle\Omega|\prod_{\mbox{shifted i}}U(a)A_{i}U^{-1}(a)|\Omega\rangle=0     where    |  Ω  ⟩     ket  normal-Ω    |\Omega\rangle   is the vacuum state , and       A  i  ′   =   {      A  i     if it is one of the unshifted operators       U   (  a  )    A  i    U   -  1     (  a  )      if it is one of the shifted operators         fragments   subscript   superscript  A  normal-′   i     fragments  normal-{     subscript  A  i   if it is one of the unshifted operators      U  a   subscript  A  i    superscript  U    1    a   if it is one of the shifted operators       A^{\prime}_{i}=\left\{\begin{matrix}A_{i}&\mbox{ if it is one of the unshifted%
  operators}\\
 U(a)A_{i}U^{-1}(a)&\mbox{ if it is one of the shifted operators}\end{matrix}\right.     provided a is a spacelike vector.  Expressed in terms of the connected correlation functions , it means if some of the arguments of the connected correlation function are shifted by large spacelike separations, the function goes to zero.  This property only holds if the vacuum is a pure state . If the vacuum is degenerate and we have a mixed state , the cluster decomposition property fails.  If the theory has a mass gap     m  >  0      m  0    m>0   , then there is a value a 0 beyond which the connected correlation function is absolutely bounded by    C   e   -   m   |  a  |          C   superscript  e      m    a        Ce^{-m|a|}   where   C   C   C   is some coefficient and    |  a  |      a    |a|   is the length of the vector   a   a   a   for     |  a  |   >   a  0         a    subscript  a  0     |a|>a_{0}   .
