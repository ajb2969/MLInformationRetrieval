   Isoflavone 7-O-glucosyltransferase      Isoflavone 7-O-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , an isoflavone 7-O-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + an isoflavone $\rightleftharpoons$ UDP + an isoflavone 7-O-beta-D-glucoside   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and isoflavone , whereas its two products are UDP and isoflavone 7-O-beta-D-glucoside .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:isoflavone 7-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-isoflavone 7-O-glucosyltransferase , UDPglucose-favonoid 7-O-glucosyltransferase , and UDPglucose:isoflavone 7-O-glucosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in isoflavonoid biosynthesis .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure  Category:Isoflavonoids metabolism
