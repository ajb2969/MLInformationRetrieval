   Integration by parts operator      Integration by parts operator   In mathematics , an integration by parts operator is a linear operator used to formulate integration by parts formulae; the most interesting examples of integration by parts operators occur in infinite-dimensional settings and find uses in stochastic analysis and its applications.  Definition  Let E be a Banach space such that both E and its continuous dual space  E ∗ are separable spaces ; let μ be a Borel measure on E . Let S be any (fixed) subset of the class of functions defined on E . A linear operator A : S → L 2 ( E , μ ; R ) is said to be an integration by parts operator for μ if        ∫  E    D  φ   (  x  )   h   (  x  )   d  μ   (  x  )     =    ∫  E    φ   (  x  )    (   A  h   )    (  x  )   d  μ   (  x  )           subscript   E     normal-D  φ  x  h  x  normal-d  μ  x      subscript   E     φ  x    A  h   x  normal-d  μ  x      \int_{E}\mathrm{D}\varphi(x)h(x)\,\mathrm{d}\mu(x)=\int_{E}\varphi(x)(Ah)(x)\,%
 \mathrm{d}\mu(x)     for every C 1 function  φ : E → R and all h ∈ S for which either side of the above equality makes sense. In the above, D φ ( x ) denotes the Fréchet derivative of φ at x .  Examples   Consider an abstract Wiener space  i : H → E with abstract Wiener measure γ . Take S to be the set of all C 1 functions from E into E ∗ ; E ∗ can be thought of as a subspace of E in view of the inclusions           E  *    →   i  *     H  *   ≅  H   →  𝑖   E   .         superscript  i    normal-→    superscript  E     superscript  H         H     i  normal-→     E     E^{*}\xrightarrow{i^{*}}H^{*}\cong H\xrightarrow{i}E.         For h ∈ S , define Ah by            (   A  h   )    (  x  )    =    h   (  x  )   x   -    trace  H   D  h   (  x  )      .          A  h   x       h  x  x      subscript  trace  H   normal-D  h  x      (Ah)(x)=h(x)x-\mathrm{trace}_{H}\mathrm{D}h(x).         This operator A is an integration by parts operator, also known as the divergence operator; a proof can be found in Elworthy (1974).    The classical Wiener space  C 0 of continuous paths in R n starting at zero and defined on the unit interval [0, 1] has another integration by parts operator. Let S be the collection         S  =   {  h  :   C  0   →   L  0   2  ,  1    |  h  is bounded and non-anticipating  }   ,     fragments  S    fragments  normal-{  h  normal-:   subscript  C  0   normal-→   superscript   subscript  L  0    2  1    normal-|  h  is bounded and non-anticipating  normal-}   normal-,    S=\left\{\left.h\colon C_{0}\to L_{0}^{2,1}\right|h\mbox{ is bounded and non-%
 anticipating}\right\},         i.e., all bounded , adapted processes with absolutely continuous sample paths. Let φ : C 0 → R be any C 1 function such that both φ and D φ are bounded. For h ∈ S and λ ∈ R , the Girsanov theorem implies that            ∫   C  0     φ   (   x  +   λ  h   (  x  )     )   d  γ   (  x  )     =    ∫   C  0     φ   (  x  )    exp   (    λ    ∫  0  1       h  ˙   s   ⋅  d    x  s      -     λ  2   2     ∫  0  1       |    h  ˙   s   |   2    d  s      )    d  γ   (  x  )      .        subscript    subscript  C  0      φ    x    λ  h  x    normal-d  γ  x      subscript    subscript  C  0      φ  x        λ    superscript   subscript   0   1      normal-⋅   subscript   normal-˙  h   s   normal-d    subscript  x  s           superscript  λ  2   2     superscript   subscript   0   1      superscript     subscript   normal-˙  h   s    2   normal-d  s       normal-d  γ  x      \int_{C_{0}}\varphi(x+\lambda h(x))\,\mathrm{d}\gamma(x)=\int_{C_{0}}\varphi(x%
 )\exp\left(\lambda\int_{0}^{1}\dot{h}_{s}\cdot\mathrm{d}x_{s}-\frac{\lambda^{2%
 }}{2}\int_{0}^{1}|\dot{h}_{s}|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}s\right)\,\mathrm{d}\gamma(x).         Differentiating with respect to λ and setting λ = 0 gives            ∫   C  0     D  φ   (  x  )   h   (  x  )   d  γ   (  x  )     =    ∫   C  0     φ   (  x  )    (   A  h   )    (  x  )   d  γ   (  x  )      ,        subscript    subscript  C  0      normal-D  φ  x  h  x  normal-d  γ  x      subscript    subscript  C  0      φ  x    A  h   x  normal-d  γ  x      \int_{C_{0}}\mathrm{D}\varphi(x)h(x)\,\mathrm{d}\gamma(x)=\int_{C_{0}}\varphi(%
 x)(Ah)(x)\,\mathrm{d}\gamma(x),         where ( Ah )( x ) is the Itō integral            ∫  0  1       h  ˙   s   ⋅  d    x  s     .      superscript   subscript   0   1      normal-⋅   subscript   normal-˙  h   s   normal-d    subscript  x  s      \int_{0}^{1}\dot{h}_{s}\cdot\mathrm{d}x_{s}.         The same relation holds for more general φ by an approximation argument; thus, the Itō integral is an integration by parts operator and can be seen as an infinite-dimensional divergence operator. This is the same result as the integration by parts formula derived from the Clark-Ocone theorem .
