Cotriple homology

In algebra, given a category C with a cotriple, the''' n-th cotriple homology''' of an object X in C with coefficients in a functor E is the n-th homotopy group of the E of the augmented simplicial object induced from X by the cotriple. The term "homology" is because in the abelian case, by the Dold–Kan correspondence, the homotopy groups are the homology of the corresponding chain complex.
Example: Let N be a left module over a ring R and let 
 
 
 
 . Let F be the left adjoint of the forgetful functor from the category of rings to Set; i.e., free module functor. Then 
 
 
 
  defines a cotriple and the n-th cotriple homology of 
 
 
 
  is the n-th left derived functor of E evaluated at M; i.e., 
 
 
 
 .
Example (algebraic K-theory):1 Let us write GL for the functor 
 
 
 
 . As before, 
 
 
 
  defines a cotriple on the category of rings with F free ring functor and U forgetful. For a ring R, one has:


 
   where on the left is the n-th K-group of R. This example is an instance of nonabelian homological algebra.
