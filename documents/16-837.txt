   Cotriple homology      Cotriple homology   In algebra, given a category C with a cotriple , the''' n -th cotriple homology''' of an object X in C with coefficients in a functor E is the n -th homotopy group of the E of the augmented simplicial object induced from X by the cotriple. The term "homology" is because in the abelian case, by the Dold–Kan correspondence , the homotopy groups are the homology of the corresponding chain complex.  Example: Let N be a left module over a ring R and let    E  =  -   ⊗  R   N     fragments  E     subscript  tensor-product  R   N    E=-\otimes_{R}N   . Let F be the left adjoint of the forgetful functor from the category of rings to Set ; i.e., free module functor. Then    F  U      F  U    FU   defines a cotriple and the n -th cotriple homology of    E   (   F   U  *   M   )       E    F   subscript  U    M     E(FU_{*}M)   is the n -th left derived functor of E evaluated at M ; i.e.,     Tor  n  R    (  M  ,  N  )       subscript   superscript  Tor  R   n   M  N    \operatorname{Tor}^{R}_{n}(M,N)   .  Example ( algebraic K-theory ): 1 Let us write GL for the functor    R  ↦     lim  →   n    G   L  n    (  R  )        maps-to  R    subscript  injective-limit  n     G   subscript  L  n   R      R\mapsto\underrightarrow{\lim}_{n}GL_{n}(R)   . As before,    F  U      F  U    FU   defines a cotriple on the category of rings with F free ring functor and U forgetful. For a ring R , one has:         K  n    (  R  )    =    π   n  -  2    G  L   (   F   U  *   R   )     ,   n  ≥  3      formulae-sequence       subscript  K  n   R      subscript  π    n  2    G  L    F   subscript  U    R       n  3     K_{n}(R)=\pi_{n-2}GL(FU_{*}R),\,n\geq 3   where on the left is the n -th K -group of R . This example is an instance of nonabelian homological algebra .  Notes  References     Further reading   Who Threw a Free Algebra in My Free Algebra? , a blog post.
