Affine action

Let 
 
 
 
  be the Weyl group of a semisimple Lie algebra

 
  (associate to fixed choice of a Cartan subalgebra

 
 ). Assume that a set of simple roots in 
 
 
 
  is chosen.
The affine action (also called the dot action) of the Weyl group on the space 
 
 
 
  is



where 
 
 
 
  is the sum of all fundamental weights, or, equivalently, the half of the sum of all positive roots.
