   Affine action      Affine action   Let   W   W   W   be the Weyl group of a semisimple Lie algebra    𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   (associate to fixed choice of a Cartan subalgebra    𝔥   𝔥   \mathfrak{h}   ). Assume that a set of simple roots in    𝔥  *     superscript  𝔥     \mathfrak{h}^{*}   is chosen.  The affine action (also called the dot action ) of the Weyl group on the space    𝔥  *     superscript  𝔥     \mathfrak{h}^{*}   is       w  ⋅  λ   :=    w   (   λ  +  δ   )    -  δ      assign   normal-⋅  w  λ       w    λ  δ    δ     w\cdot\lambda:=w(\lambda+\delta)-\delta     where   δ   δ   \delta   is the sum of all fundamental weights , or, equivalently, the half of the sum of all positive roots .
