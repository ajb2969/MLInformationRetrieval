   Retinal dehydrogenase      Retinal dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a retinal dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   retinal + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   retinoic acid + NADH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are retinal , NAD + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are retinoic acid , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is retinal:NAD+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called cytosolic retinal dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in retinol metabolism . It has 2 cofactors : FAD , and Metal .  References     "  Category:EC 1.2.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Flavin enzymes  Category:Metal enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
