Additive K-theory

In mathematics, additive K-theory means some version of algebraic K-theory in which, according to Spencer Bloch, the general linear group GL has everywhere been replaced by its Lie algebra gl.1 It is not, therefore, one theory but a way of creating additive or infinitesimal analogues of multiplicative theories.
Formulation
Following Boris Feigin and Boris Tsygan,2 let 
 
 
 
  be an algebra over a field 
 
 
 
  of characteristic zero and let 
 
 
 
  be the algebra of infinite matrices over 
 
 
 
  with only finitely many nonzero entries. Then the Lie algebra homology



has a natural structure of a Hopf algebra. The space of its primitive elements of degree 
 
 
 
  is denoted by 
 
 
 
  and called the 
 
 
 
 -th additive K-functor ofÂ A.
The additive K-functors are related to cyclic homology groups by the isomorphism
