   Additive K-theory      Additive K-theory   In mathematics , additive K-theory means some version of algebraic K-theory in which, according to Spencer Bloch , the general linear group  GL has everywhere been replaced by its Lie algebra  gl . 1 It is not, therefore, one theory but a way of creating additive or infinitesimal analogues of multiplicative theories.  Formulation  Following Boris Feigin and Boris Tsygan , 2 let   A   A   A   be an algebra over a field   k   k   k   of characteristic zero and let    ùî§  l   (  A  )       ùî§  l  A    {\mathfrak{g}l}(A)   be the algebra of infinite matrices over   A   A   A   with only finitely many nonzero entries. Then the Lie algebra homology       H  ‚ãÖ    (   ùî§  l   (  A  )    ,  k  )        subscript  H  normal-‚ãÖ      ùî§  l  A   k     H_{\cdot}({\mathfrak{g}l}(A),k)\,     has a natural structure of a Hopf algebra . The space of its primitive elements of degree   i   i   i   is denoted by     K  i  +    (  A  )        subscript   superscript  K    i   A    K^{+}_{i}(A)   and called the   i   i   i   -th additive K-functor of A .  The additive K-functors are related to cyclic homology groups by the isomorphism        H   C  i    (  A  )    ‚âÖ    K   i  +  1   +    (  A  )     .        H   subscript  C  i   A      subscript   superscript  K      i  1    A     HC_{i}(A)\cong K^{+}_{i+1}(A).\,     References  "  Category:K-theory     http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~bloch/addchow_rept.pdf ‚Ü©  B.
