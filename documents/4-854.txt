 In numerical analysis and functional analysis, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is any wavelet transform for which the wavelets are discretely sampled. As with other wavelet transforms, a key advantage it has over Fourier transforms is temporal resolution: it captures both frequency and location information (location in time).
Examples
Haar wavelets
The first DWT was invented by Hungarian mathematician Alfréd Haar. For an input represented by a list of 
 
 
 
  numbers, the Haar wavelet transform may be considered to pair up input values, storing the difference and passing the sum. This process is repeated recursively, pairing up the sums to provide the next scale, which leads to 
 
 
 
  differences and a final sum.
Daubechies wavelets
The most commonly used set of discrete wavelet transforms was formulated by the Belgian mathematician Ingrid Daubechies in 1988. This formulation is based on the use of recurrence relations to generate progressively finer discrete samplings of an implicit mother wavelet function; each resolution is twice that of the previous scale. In her seminal paper, Daubechies derives a family of wavelets, the first of which is the Haar wavelet. Interest in this field has exploded since then, and many variations of Daubechies' original wavelets were developed.1
The Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (ℂWT)
The Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (ℂWT) is a relatively recent enhancement to the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), with important additional properties: It is nearly shift invariant and directionally selective in two and higher dimensions. It achieves this with a redundancy factor of only 
 
 
 
  substantially lower than the undecimated DWT. The multidimensional (M-D) dual-tree ℂWT is nonseparable but is based on a computationally efficient, separable filter bank (FB).2
Others
Other forms of discrete wavelet transform include the non- or undecimated wavelet transform (where downsampling is omitted), the Newland transform (where an orthonormal basis of wavelets is formed from appropriately constructed top-hat filters in frequency space). Wavelet packet transforms are also related to the discrete wavelet transform. Complex wavelet transform is another form.
Properties
The Haar DWT illustrates the desirable properties of wavelets in general. First, it can be performed in 
 
 
 
  operations; second, it captures not only a notion of the frequency content of the input, by examining it at different scales, but also temporal content, i.e. the times at which these frequencies occur. Combined, these two properties make the Fast wavelet transform (FWT) an alternative to the conventional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
Time Issues
Due to the rate-change operators in the filter bank, the discrete WT is not time-invariant but actually very sensitive to the alignment of the signal in time. To address the time-varying problem of wavelet transforms, Mallat and Zhong proposed a new algorithm for wavelet representation of a signal, which is invariant to time shifts.3 According to this algorithm, which is called a TI-DWT, only the scale parameter is sampled along the dyadic sequence 2^j (j∈Z) and the wavelet transform is calculated for each point in time.45
Applications
The discrete wavelet transform has a huge number of applications in science, engineering, mathematics and computer science. Most notably, it is used for signal coding, to represent a discrete signal in a more redundant form, often as a preconditioning for data compression. Practical applications can also be found in signal processing of accelerations for gait analysis,6 in digital communications and many others.7 89
It is shown that discrete wavelet transform (discrete in scale and shift, and continuous in time) is successfully implemented as analog filter bank in biomedical signal processing for design of low-power pacemakers and also in ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless communications.10
Comparison with Fourier transform
To illustrate the differences and similarities between the discrete wavelet transform with the discrete Fourier transform, consider the DWT and DFT of the following sequence: (1,0,0,0), a unit impulse.
The DFT has orthogonal basis (DFT matrix):



while the DWT with Haar wavelets for length 4 data has orthogonal basis in the rows of:



(To simplify notation, whole numbers are used, so the bases are orthogonal but not orthonormal.)
Preliminary observations include:

Wavelets have location – the (1,1,–1,–1) wavelet corresponds to “left side” if its coefficient is positive or “right side” if its coefficient is negative, while the last two wavelets each have support on the left side or the right side (one is a translation of the other).
Sinusoidal waves do not have location – they spread across the whole space – but do have phase – the second and third waves are translations of each other, corresponding to being 90° out of phase, like cosine and sine, of which these are discrete versions.

Decomposing the sequence with respect to these bases yields:


 
 
  The DWT demonstrates the localization: the (1,1,1,1) term gives the average signal value, the (1,1,–1,–1) places the signal in the left side of the domain, and the (1,–1,0,0) places it at the left side of the left side, and truncating at any stage yields a downsampled version of the signal:


 
 
   The DFT, by contrast, expresses the sequence by the interference of waves of various frequencies – thus truncating the series yields a low-pass filtered version of the series:


 
 
  Notably, the middle approximation (2-term) differs. From the frequency domain perspective, this is a better approximation, but from the time domain perspective it has drawbacks – it exhibits undershoot – one of the values is negative, though the original series is non-negative everywhere – and ringing, where the right side is non-zero, unlike in the wavelet transform. On the other hand, the Fourier approximation correctly shows a peak, and all points are within 
 
 
 
  of their correct value, though all points have error. The wavelet approximation, by contrast, places a peak on the left half, but has no peak at the first point, and while it is exactly correct for half the values (reflecting location), it has an error of 
 
 
 
  for the other values.
This illustrates the kinds of trade-offs between these transforms, and how in some respects the DWT provides preferable behavior, particularly for the modeling of transients.
Definition
One level of the transform
The DWT of a signal 
 
 
 
  is calculated by passing it through a series of filters. First the samples are passed through a low pass filter with impulse response

 
 
  resulting in a convolution of the two:



The signal is also decomposed simultaneously using a high-pass filter

 
 . The outputs giving the detail coefficients (from the high-pass filter) and approximation coefficients (from the low-pass). It is important that the two filters are related to each other and they are known as a quadrature mirror filter.
However, since half the frequencies of the signal have now been removed, half the samples can be discarded according to Nyquist’s rule. The filter outputs are then subsampled by 2. In the next two formulas, the notation is the opposite: g- denotes high pass and h- low pass as is Mallat's and the common notation:






This decomposition has halved the time resolution since only half of each filter output characterises the signal. However, each output has half the frequency band of the input so the frequency resolution has been doubled.
(Figure)

With the subsampling operator 
 
 




the above summation can be written more concisely.






However computing a complete convolution 
 
 
 
  with subsequent downsampling would waste computation time.
The Lifting scheme is an optimization where these two computations are interleaved.
Cascading and Filter banks
This decomposition is repeated to further increase the frequency resolution and the approximation coefficients decomposed with high and low pass filters and then down-sampled. This is represented as a binary tree with nodes representing a sub-space with a different time-frequency localisation. The tree is known as a filter bank.
(Figure)
A 3 level filter bank

At each level in the above diagram the signal is decomposed into low and high frequencies. Due to the decomposition process the input signal must be a multiple of 
 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the number of levels.
For example a signal with 32 samples, frequency range 0 to 
 
 
 
  and 3 levels of decomposition, 4 output scales are produced:

Relationship to the Mother Wavelet
The filterbank implementation of wavelets can be interpreted as computing the wavelet coefficients of a discrete set of child wavelets for a given mother wavelet 
 
 
 
 . In the case of the discrete wavelet transform, the mother wavelet is shifted and scaled by powers of two



where 
 
 
 
  is the scale parameter and 
 
 
 
  is the shift parameter, both which are integers.
Recall that the wavelet coefficient 
 
 
 
 
  of a signal 
 
 
 
  is the projection of 
 
 
 
  onto a wavelet, and let 
 
 
 
  be a signal of length 
 
 
 
 . In the case of a child wavelet in the discrete family above,



Now fix 
 
 
 
  at a particular scale, so that 
 
 
 
  is a function of 
 
 
 
  only. In light of the above equation, 
 
 
 
  can be viewed as a convolution of 
 
 
 
 
  with a dilated, reflected, and normalized version of the mother wavelet, 
 
 
 
 , sampled at the points 
 
 
 
 . But this is precisely what the detail coefficients give at level 
 
 
 
  of the discrete wavelet transform. Therefore, for an appropriate choice of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 , the detail coefficients of the filter bank correspond exactly to a wavelet coefficient of a discrete set of child wavelets for a given mother wavelet 
 
 
 
 .
As an example, consider the discrete Haar wavelet, whose mother wavelet is 
 
 
 
 . Then the dilated, reflected, and normalized version of this wavelet is 
 
 
 
 , which is, indeed, the highpass decomposition filter for the discrete Haar wavelet transform
Time Complexity
The filterbank implementation of the Discrete Wavelet Transform takes only O(N) in certain cases, as compared to O(N log N) for the fast Fourier transform.
Note that if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are both a constant length (i.e. their length is independent of N), then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  each take O(N) time. The wavelet filterbank does each of these two O(N) convolutions, then splits the signal into two branches of size N/2. But it only recursively splits the upper branch convolved with 
 
 
 
  (as contrasted with the FFT, which recursively splits both the upper branch and the lower branch). This leads to the following recurrence relation



which leads to an O(N) time for the entire operation, as can be shown by a geometric series expansion of the above relation.
As an example, the Discrete Haar Wavelet Transform is linear, since in that case 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are constant length 2.



Other transforms
The Adam7 algorithm, used for interlacing in the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, is a multiscale model of the data which is similar to a DWT with Haar wavelets.
Unlike the DWT, it has a specific scale – it starts from an 8×8 block, and it downsamples the image, rather than decimating (low-pass filtering, then downsampling). It thus offers worse frequency behavior, showing artifacts (pixelation) at the early stages, in return for simpler implementation.
Code example
In its simplest form, the DWT is remarkably easy to compute.
The Haar wavelet in Java:
public static int[] discreteHaarWaveletTransform(int[] input) {
     // This function assumes that input.length=2^n, n>1
     int[] output = new int[input.length];
 
     for (int length = input.length >> 1; ; length >>= 1) {
         // length = input.length / 2^n, WITH n INCREASING to log_2(input.length)
         for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
             int sum = input[i * 2] + input[i * 2 + 1];
             int difference = input[i * 2] - input[i * 2 + 1];
             output[i] = sum;
             output[length + i] = difference;
         }
         if (length == 1) {
             return output;
         }
 
         //Swap arrays to do next iteration
         System.arraycopy(output, 0, input, 0, length << 1);
     }
 }
Complete Java code for a 1-D and 2-D DWT using Haar, Daubechies, Coiflet, and Legendre wavelets is available from the open source project: JWave. Furthermore, a fast lifting implementation of the discrete biorthogonal CDF 9/7 wavelet transform in C, used in the JPEG 2000 image compression standard can be found here (archived 5 March 2012).
Example of Above Code
(Figure)
An example of computing the discrete Haar wavelet coefficients for a sound signal of someone saying "I Love Wavelets." The original waveform is shown in blue in the upper left, and the wavelet coefficients are shown in black in the upper right. Along the bottom is shown three zoomed-in regions of the wavelet coefficients for different ranges.

This figure shows an example of applying the above code to compute the Haar wavelet coefficients on a sound waveform. This example highlights two key properties of the wavelet transform:

Natural signals often have some degree of smoothness, which makes them sparse in the wavelet domain. There are far fewer significant components in the wavelet domain in this example than there are in the time domain, and most of the significant components are towards the coarser coefficients on the left. Hence, natural signals are compressible in the wavelet domain.


The wavelet transform is a multiresolution, bandpass representation of a signal. This can be seen directly from the filterbank definition of the discrete wavelet transform given in this article. For a signal of length 
 
 
 
 , the coefficients in the range 
 
 
 
  represent a version of the original signal which is in the pass-band 
 
 
 
 
 . This is why zooming in on these ranges of the wavelet coefficients looks so similar in structure to the original signal. Ranges which are closer to the left (larger 
 
 
 
  in the above notation), are coarser representations of the signal, while ranges to the right represent finer details.
