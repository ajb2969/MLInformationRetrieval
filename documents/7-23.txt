   George Secor      George Secor   George Secor , a composer from Chicago, 1 is the discoverer of miracle temperament and eponym of the secor .  Secor and Hermann Pedtke's Motorola Scalatron (1974) is a Bosanquet generalized keyboard featuring a multicolored arrangement of 240 tunable oval keys, about which Secor said: "There is not much point in using this alternative keyboard for systems below 31 tones in the octave." 2 However, "even if it were completely impractical musically, it would make a wonderful prop for a futuristic movie." 3 Though its synthesizer capacities may not reach performance level, according to Easley Blackwood , "It has rock-steady tuning capabilities; you can always count on it to be right." 4  Secor  (Figure)  7-limit 8:7 septimal whole tone  .   In music , a secor is the interval of 116.7 cents ( )  named after George Secor. Secor devised it to allow a close approximation, generated from a single interval, to Harry Partch 's 43 tone just intonation scale . All 11-limit consonances are approximated to within 3.32 cents. 5  It is approximated in 31 , 41 , and 72 equal temperament . 6 For tuning purposes, a secor of seven steps of 72 equal temperament is often used.  Two secors (233.4 ) approximate an 8:7 interval (231.17), a septimal whole tone . Three of these 8:7 intervals (693.51), or six secors (700.2 ), approximate a fifth (701.96). A neutral third of 11:9 (347.41) is approximated by three secors (350.1 ).  Miracle temperament  In music , miracle temperament is a regular  temperament discovered by George Secor in 1974 which has as a generator an interval, called the secor , that serves as both the 15:14 and 16:15 semitones. Because 15:14 and 16:15 are equated, their ratio 225:224     (     15  14   ÷   16  15    =   225  224    )          15  14     16  15      225  224     \left(\tfrac{15}{14}\div\tfrac{16}{15}=\tfrac{225}{224}\right)   is tempered out, and two secors give an 8:7 interval, a septimal whole tone . Three of these 8:7 intervals, or six secors, make up a fifth, so that 1029:1024    (     3  2   ÷    (   8  7   )   3    =   1029  1024    )          3  2    superscript    8  7   3      1029  1024     \left(\tfrac{3}{2}\div\left(\tfrac{8}{7}\right)^{3}=\tfrac{1029}{1024}\right)   is also tempered out. This gives the seven - limit version of miracle.  A septimal whole tone of 8:7 as we have seen is approximated by two secors, and a neutral third of 11:9 by three secors. In miracle, a minor third plus a septimal whole tone is also equated with the 11th harmonic . This means that the gap between a minor third plus a septimal whole tone    (     8  7   ×   6  5    =   48  35    )          8  7     6  5      48  35     \left(\tfrac{8}{7}\times\tfrac{6}{5}=\tfrac{48}{35}\right)   and the 11th harmonic (an 11:8 ratio), 385:384    (     11  8   ÷   48  35    =   385  384    )          11  8     48  35      385  384     \left(\tfrac{11}{8}\div\tfrac{48}{35}=\tfrac{385}{384}\right)   ., is also tempered out. Miracle, therefore, is the temperament tempering out 225:224, 1029:1024 and 385:384 at the same time.  For tuning purposes, a secor of seven steps of 72 equal temperament can be used. While this also tempers out 4375:4374 (the ragisma ), doing this is not regarded as a part of the definition of miracle temperament.  Miracle temperament, particularly in the ten note Miracle scale () and the distributionally even scale known as Blackjack (). The twenty-one note Blackjack scale is derived from twenty successive secors and has been used by several composers, including New York composer Joseph Pehrson . 7   s is a secor, q is the difference between 10 secors and 1 octave, and r is the difference between s and q . If the Miracle scale is:   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0 '  s    s    s    s    s    s    s    s    s    s    +q  q +r q +r q +r q +r q +r q +r q +r q +r q +r q +r +q   then the Blackjack scale is:   0 >0 1 >1 2 >2 3 >3 4 >4 5 >5 6 >6 7 >7 8 >8 9 >9 0 >1 >2 >3 >4 >5 >6 >7 >8 >9 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9      Barbieri, Patrizio (2008).
