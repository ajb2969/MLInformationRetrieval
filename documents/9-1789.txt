Wirtinger inequality (2-forms)


For other inequalities named after Wirtinger, see Wirtinger's inequality.


In mathematics, the Wirtinger inequality for 2-forms, named after Wilhelm Wirtinger, states that on a Kähler manifold

 
 , the exterior 
 
 
th power of the symplectic form (Kähler form) ω, when evaluated on a simple (decomposable) 
 
 
 
 -vector ζ of unit volume, is bounded above by 
 
 
 
 . That is,



In other words, 
 
 
 
  is a calibration on 
 
 
 
 . An important corollary is that every complex submanifold of a Kähler manifold is volume minimizing in its homology class.
