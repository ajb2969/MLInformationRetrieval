   Wirtinger inequality (2-forms)      Wirtinger inequality (2-forms)    For other inequalities named after Wirtinger, see Wirtinger's inequality .    In mathematics, the Wirtinger inequality for 2-forms , named after Wilhelm Wirtinger , states that on a Kähler manifold    M   M   M   , the exterior   k   k   k    th power of the symplectic form (Kähler form) ω, when evaluated on a simple (decomposable)    (   2  k   )      2  k    (2k)   -vector ζ of unit volume, is bounded above by    k  !      k    k!   . That is,         ω  k    (  ζ  )    ≤   k  !    .         superscript  ω  k   ζ     k     \omega^{k}(\zeta)\leq k!\,.     In other words,     ω  k    k  !        superscript  ω  k     k     \textstyle{\frac{\omega^{k}}{k!}}   is a calibration on   M   M   M   . An important corollary is that every complex submanifold of a Kähler manifold is volume minimizing in its homology class.
