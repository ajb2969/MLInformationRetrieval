   Receptor protein serine/threonine kinase      Receptor protein serine/threonine kinase   In enzymology , a receptor protein serine/threonine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + [receptor-protein]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + [receptor-protein] phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and receptor-protein , whereas its two products are ADP and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , to be specific those transferring phosphorus-containing groups protein-serine/threonine kinases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:[receptor-protein] phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include activin receptor kinase , receptor type I serine/threonine protein kinase , receptor type II serine/threonine protein kinase , STK13 , TGF-beta kinase , and receptor serine/threonine protein kinase . This enzyme participates in 7 metabolic pathways : mapk signaling pathway , cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction , TGF beta signaling pathway , adherens junction , colorectal cancer , pancreatic cancer , and chronic myeloid leukemia .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
