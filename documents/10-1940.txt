Aconitate decarboxylase

In enzymology, an aconitate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

cis-aconitate 
 
 
 
  itaconate + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, cis-aconitate, and two products, itaconate and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cis-aconitate carboxy-lyase (itaconate-forming). Other names in common use include cis-aconitic decarboxylase, CAD, cis-aconitate carboxy-lyase, and cis-aconitate carboxy-lyase. This enzyme participates in c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism.
