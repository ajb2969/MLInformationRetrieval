Ceramide cholinephosphotransferase

In enzymology, a ceramide cholinephosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

CDP-choline + N-acylsphingosine 
 
 
 
  CMP + sphingomyelin
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CDP-choline and N-acylsphingosine, whereas its two products are CMP and sphingomyelin.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring non-standard substituted phosphate groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CDP-choline:N-acylsphingosine cholinephosphotransferase. This enzyme is also called phosphorylcholine-ceramide transferase. This enzyme participates in sphingolipid metabolism.
