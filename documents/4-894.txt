   Fisher transformation      Fisher transformation   In statistics , hypotheses about the value of the population correlation coefficient ρ between variables X and Y can be tested using the Fisher transformation 1 2 (aka Fisher z-transformation ) applied to the sample correlation coefficient .  Definition  Given a set of N bivariate sample pairs ( X i , Y i ), i = 1, ..., N , the sample correlation coefficient  r is given by      r  =     ∑   i  =  1   N     (    X  i   -   X  ¯    )    (    Y  i   -   Y  ¯    )         ∑   i  =  1   N     (    X  i   -   X  ¯    )   2        ∑   i  =  1   N     (    Y  i   -   Y  ¯    )   2           r      subscript   superscript   N     i  1         subscript  X  i    normal-¯  X       subscript  Y  i    normal-¯  Y            subscript   superscript   N     i  1     superscript     subscript  X  i    normal-¯  X    2         subscript   superscript   N     i  1     superscript     subscript  Y  i    normal-¯  Y    2         r=\frac{\sum^{N}_{i=1}(X_{i}-\bar{X})(Y_{i}-\bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum^{N}_{i=1}(X_{%
 i}-\bar{X})^{2}}\sqrt{\sum^{N}_{i=1}(Y_{i}-\bar{Y})^{2}}}     Fisher's z-transformation of r is defined as       z  :=    1  2    ln   (    1  +  r    1  -  r    )     =   arctanh   (  r  )     ,       assign  z      1  2         1  r     1  r            arctanh  r      z:={1\over 2}\ln\left({1+r\over 1-r}\right)=\operatorname{arctanh}(r),     where "ln" is the natural logarithm function and "arctanh" is the inverse hyperbolic tangent function .  If ( X , Y ) has a bivariate normal distribution , and if the pairs ( X i , Y i ) are independent, then z is approximately normally distributed with mean        1  2    ln   (    1  +  ρ    1  -  ρ    )     ,        1  2         1  ρ     1  ρ       {1\over 2}\ln\left({{1+\rho}\over{1-\rho}}\right),     and standard error       1    N  -  3     ,      1      N  3      {1\over\sqrt{N-3}},     where N is the sample size, and ρ is the true correlation coefficient.  This transformation, and its inverse       r  =     exp   (   2  z   )    -  1     exp   (   2  z   )    +  1    =   tanh   (  z  )     ,        r          2  z    1         2  z    1          tanh  z      r={{\exp(2z)-1}\over{\exp(2z)+1}}=\operatorname{tanh}(z),     can be used to construct a confidence interval for ρ .  Discussion  The Fisher transformation is an approximate variance-stabilizing transformation for r when X and Y follow a bivariate normal distribution. This means that the variance of z is approximately constant for all values of the population correlation coefficient ρ . Without the Fisher transformation, the variance of r grows smaller as | ρ | gets closer to 1. Since the Fisher transformation is approximately the identity function when | r |  determined the exact distribution of z for data from a bivariate Type A Edgeworth distribution . Hotelling in 1953 calculated the Taylor series expressions for the moments of z and several related statistics 3 and Hawkins in 1989 discovered the asymptotic distribution of z for data from a distribution with bounded fourth moments. 4  Other uses  While the Fisher transformation is mainly associated with the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient for bivariate normal observations, it can also be applied to Spearman's rank correlation coefficient in more general cases. A similar result for the asymptotic distribution applies, but with a minor adjustment factor: see the latter article for details.
