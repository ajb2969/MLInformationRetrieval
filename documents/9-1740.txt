   Opial property      Opial property   In mathematics , the Opial property is an abstract property of Banach spaces that plays an important role in the study of weak convergence of iterates of mappings of Banach spaces, and of the asymptotic behaviour of nonlinear semigroups . The property is named after the Polish  mathematician  Zdzisław Opial .  Definitions  Let ( X , || ||) be a Banach space. X is said to have the Opial property if, whenever ( x n ) n ∈ N is a sequence in X converging weakly to some x 0 ∈ X and x ≠ x 0 , it follows that         lim inf   n  →  ∞     ∥    x  n   -   x  0    ∥    <    lim inf   n  →  ∞     ∥    x  n   -  x   ∥     .        subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n      norm     subscript  x  n    subscript  x  0        subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n      norm     subscript  x  n   x       \liminf_{n\to\infty}\|x_{n}-x_{0}\|<\liminf_{n\to\infty}\|x_{n}-x\|.     Alternatively, using the contrapositive , this condition may be written as         lim inf   n  →  ∞     ∥    x  n   -  x   ∥    ≤    lim inf   n  →  ∞     ∥    x  n   -   x  0    ∥    ⟹  x  =   x  0    .          subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n      norm     subscript  x  n   x       subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n      norm     subscript  x  n    subscript  x  0           x        subscript  x  0      \liminf_{n\to\infty}\|x_{n}-x\|\leq\liminf_{n\to\infty}\|x_{n}-x_{0}\|\implies

If X is the continuous dual space of some other Banach space Y , then X is said to have the weak-∗ Opial property if, whenever ( x n ) n ∈ N is a sequence in X converging weakly-∗ to some x 0 ∈ X and x ≠ x 0 , it follows that         lim inf   n  →  ∞     ∥    x  n   -   x  0    ∥    <    lim inf   n  →  ∞     ∥    x  n   -  x   ∥     ,        subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n      norm     subscript  x  n    subscript  x  0        subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n      norm     subscript  x  n   x       \liminf_{n\to\infty}\|x_{n}-x_{0}\|<\liminf_{n\to\infty}\|x_{n}-x\|,     or, as above,         lim inf   n  →  ∞     ∥    x  n   -  x   ∥    ≤    lim inf   n  →  ∞     ∥    x  n   -   x  0    ∥    ⟹  x  =   x  0    .          subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n      norm     subscript  x  n   x       subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n      norm     subscript  x  n    subscript  x  0           x        subscript  x  0      \liminf_{n\to\infty}\|x_{n}-x\|\leq\liminf_{n\to\infty}\|x_{n}-x_{0}\|\implies

A (dual) Banach space X is said to have the uniform (weak-∗) Opial property if, for every c > 0, there exists an r > 0 such that       1  +  r   ≤    lim inf   n  →  ∞     ∥    x  n   -  x   ∥          1  r     subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n      norm     subscript  x  n   x       1+r\leq\liminf_{n\to\infty}\|x_{n}-x\|     for every x ∈ X with || x || ≥ c and every sequence ( x n ) n ∈ N in X converging weakly (weakly-∗) to 0 and with        lim inf   n  →  ∞     ∥   x  n   ∥    ≥  1.        subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n      norm   subscript  x  n     1.    \liminf_{n\to\infty}\|x_{n}\|\geq 1.
