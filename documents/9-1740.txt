Opial property

In mathematics, the Opial property is an abstract property of Banach spaces that plays an important role in the study of weak convergence of iterates of mappings of Banach spaces, and of the asymptotic behaviour of nonlinear semigroups. The property is named after the Polish mathematician Zdzisław Opial.
Definitions
Let (X, || ||) be a Banach space. X is said to have the Opial property if, whenever (xn)n∈N is a sequence in X converging weakly to some x0 ∈ X and x ≠ x0, it follows that



Alternatively, using the contrapositive, this condition may be written as



If X is the continuous dual space of some other Banach space Y, then X is said to have the weak-∗ Opial property if, whenever (xn)n∈N is a sequence in X converging weakly-∗ to some x0 ∈ X and x ≠ x0, it follows that



or, as above,



A (dual) Banach space X is said to have the uniform (weak-∗) Opial property if, for every c > 0, there exists an r > 0 such that



for every x ∈ X with ||x|| ≥ c and every sequence (xn)n∈N in X converging weakly (weakly-∗) to 0 and with



Examples

Opial's theorem (1967): Every Hilbert space has the Opial property.
