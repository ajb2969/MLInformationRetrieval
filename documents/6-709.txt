List of Pittsburgh Pirates team records

 The Pittsburgh Pirates are a professional baseball team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They compete in the Central Division of Major League Baseball's (MLB) National League (NL). Founded in 1882 as Allegheny, the franchise has been variously known throughout its history as the Pittsburgh Alleghenys (1887–1889), the Pittsburg Innocents (1890) and the Pittsburg Pirates (1891–1911) until becoming the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1912. The list below documents players and teams that hold particular club records.
In 133 seasons from 1882 through 2014, the team has won over 9,000 games and five World Series championships. The team has appeared in 17 postseasons and has won nine league pennants. Roberto Clemente owns the most career batting records with five. Ralph Kiner, Arky Vaughan and Paul Waner each own three single-season batting records. Bob Friend owns the most career pitching records and Ed Morris the most single-season pitching records, both with six.
In their history, the Pittsburgh Pirates have set three Major League Baseball records. In 1912, Chief Wilson hit an MLB-record 36 triples and, on May 30, 1925, the team collectively hit a major league-record eight triples in a single game. In addition, six no-hitters have been thrown in the history of the franchise, with the most recent on July 12, 1997. The Pirates also hold the MLB—and North American professional sports—record for most consecutive losing seasons with 20. The stretch began with the 1993 season and concluded with the 2012 season, at which point the Pirates recorded a winning record and a playoff berth in the 2013 season.
