   Solution set      Solution set   In mathematics , a solution set is the set of values that satisfy a given set of equations or inequalities.  For example, for a set    {   f  i   }      subscript  f  i     \{f_{i}\}   of polynomials over a ring    R   R   R   , the solution set is the subset of   R   R   R   on which the polynomials all vanish (evaluate to 0), formally       {   x  ∈  R   :     ∀  i   ∈  I   ,     f  i    (  x  )    =  0    }   .     conditional-set    x  R    formulae-sequence     for-all  i   I        subscript  f  i   x   0      \{x\in R:\forall i\in I,f_{i}(x)=0\}.     Examples  1. The solution set of the single equation    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   is the set  {0}.  2. For any non-zero polynomial   f   f   f   over the complex numbers in one variable, the solution set is made up of finitely many points.  3. However, for a complex polynomial in more than one variable the solution set has no isolated points.  Remarks  In algebraic geometry , solution sets are used to define the Zariski topology . See affine varieties .  Other meanings  More generally, the solution set to an arbitrary collection E of relations ( E i ) ( i varying in some index set I ) for a collection of unknowns     (   x  j   )    j  ∈  J      subscript   subscript  x  j     j  J     {(x_{j})}_{j\in J}   , supposed to take values in respective spaces     (   X  j   )    j  ∈  J      subscript   subscript  X  j     j  J     {(X_{j})}_{j\in J}   , is the set S of all solutions to the relations E , where a solution    x   (  k  )      superscript  x  k    x^{(k)}   is a family of values      (   x  j   (  k  )    )    j  ∈  J    ∈    ∏   j  ∈  J     X  j         subscript   subscript   superscript  x  k   j     j  J      subscript  product    j  J     subscript  X  j      {(x^{(k)}_{j})}_{j\in J}\in\prod_{j\in J}X_{j}   such that substituting     (   x  j   )    j  ∈  J      subscript   subscript  x  j     j  J     {(x_{j})}_{j\in J}   by    x   (  k  )      superscript  x  k    x^{(k)}   in the collection E makes all relations "true".  (Instead of relations depending on unknowns, one should speak more correctly of predicates , the collection E is their logical conjunction , and the solution set is the inverse image of the boolean value true by the associated boolean-valued function .)  The above meaning is a special case of this one, if the set of polynomials f i if interpreted as the set of equations f i (x)=0 .  Examples   The solution set for '' E = { x+y = 0 } '' w.r.t.     (  x  ,  y  )   ∈   ℝ  2        x  y    superscript  ℝ  2     (x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^{2}   is '' S = { (a,-a) ; a ∈ R } ''.  The solution set for '' E = { x+y = 0 } '' w.r.t.    x  ∈  ℝ      x  ℝ    x\in\mathbb{R}   is '' S = { -y } ''. (Here, y is not "declared" as an unknown, and thus to be seen as a parameter on which the equation, and therefore the solution set, depends.)  The solution set for    E  =   {   x   ≤  4  }      fragments  E    fragments  normal-{    x    4  normal-}     E=\{\sqrt{x}\leq 4\}   w.r.t.    x  ∈  ℝ      x  ℝ    x\in\mathbb{R}   is the interval '' S = [0,2] '' (since    x      x    \sqrt{x}   is undefined for negative values of x ).  The solution set for    E  =   {  exp   (  i  x  )   =  1  }      fragments  E    fragments  normal-{    fragments  normal-(  i  x  normal-)    1  normal-}     E=\{\exp(ix)=1\}   w.r.t.    x  ∈  ℂ      x  ℂ    x\in\mathbb{C}   is '' S'' = 2 π Z (see Euler's identity ).
