   Flexoelectricity      Flexoelectricity   Flexoelectricity is a property of a dielectric material whereby it exhibits a spontaneous electrical polarization induced by a strain gradient. Flexoelectricity is not the same as Ferroelasticity .  The electric polarization due to mechanical stress in a dielectric is given by:       P  i   =     d   i  j  k     σ   j  k     +    μ   i  j  k  l      ∂   ϵ   j  k      ∂   x  l            subscript  P  i        subscript  d    i  j  k     subscript  σ    j  k        subscript  μ    i  j  k  l         subscript  ϵ    j  k        subscript  x  l         P_{i}=d_{ijk}\sigma_{jk}+\mu_{ijkl}\frac{\partial\epsilon_{jk}}{\partial x_{l}}     where the first term corresponds to the direct piezoelectric effect and the second term corresponds to the flexoelectric polarization induced by the strain gradient.  Here, the flexoelectric coefficient,    μ   i  j  k  l      subscript  μ    i  j  k  l     \mu_{ijkl}   , is a fourth-rank polar tensor and    d   i  j  k      subscript  d    i  j  k     d_{ijk}   is the coefficient corresponding to the direct piezoelectric effect.
