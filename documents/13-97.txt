Flexoelectricity

Flexoelectricity is a property of a dielectric material whereby it exhibits a spontaneous electrical polarization induced by a strain gradient. Flexoelectricity is not the same as Ferroelasticity.
The electric polarization due to mechanical stress in a dielectric is given by:



where the first term corresponds to the direct piezoelectric effect and the second term corresponds to the flexoelectric polarization induced by the strain gradient.
Here, the flexoelectric coefficient, 
 
 
 
 , is a fourth-rank polar tensor and 
 
 
 
  is the coefficient corresponding to the direct piezoelectric effect.
