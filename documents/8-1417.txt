   Trailing zero      Trailing zero   In mathematics , trailing zeros are a sequence of 0s in the decimal representation (or more generally, in any positional representation ) of a number, after which no other digits follow.  Trailing zeros to the right of a decimal point , as in 12.3400, do not affect the value of a number and may be omitted if all that is of interest is its numerical value. This is true even if the zeros recur infinitely . However, trailing zeros may be useful for indicating the number of significant figures , for example in a measurement. In such a context, "simplifying" a number by removing trailing zeros would be incorrect.  The number of trailing zeros in a non-zero base- b  integer  n equals the exponent of the highest power of b that divides n . For example, 14000 has three trailing zeros and is therefore divisible by 1000 = 10 3 , but not by 10 4 . This property is useful when looking for small factors in integer factorization . Some computer architectures have a count trailing zeros operation in their instruction set for efficiently determining the number of trailing zero bits in a machine word.  Factorial  The number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of n !, the factorial of a non-negative  integer  n , is simply the multiplicity of the prime factor 5 in n !. This can be determined with this special case of de Polignac's formula : 1        f   (  n  )    =    ∑   i  =  1   k    ⌊   n   5  i    ⌋    =    ⌊   n  5   ⌋   +   ⌊   n   5  2    ⌋   +   ⌊   n   5  3    ⌋   +  ⋯  +   ⌊   n   5  k    ⌋     ,          f  n     superscript   subscript     i  1    k       n   superscript  5  i                 n  5        n   superscript  5  2         n   superscript  5  3     normal-⋯      n   superscript  5  k         f(n)=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\left\lfloor\frac{n}{5^{i}}\right\rfloor=\left\lfloor\frac{%
 n}{5}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{n}{5^{2}}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{%
 n}{5^{3}}\right\rfloor+\cdots+\left\lfloor\frac{n}{5^{k}}\right\rfloor,\,     where k must be chosen such that        5   k  +  1    >  n   ,       superscript  5    k  1    n    5^{k+1}>n,\,     and    ⌊  a  ⌋      a    \lfloor a\rfloor   denotes the floor function applied to a . For n = 0, 1, 2, ... this is   0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, ... .   For example, 5 3 > 32, and therefore 32! = 263130836933693530167218012160000000 ends in        ⌊   32  5   ⌋   +   ⌊   32   5  2    ⌋    =   6  +  1   =   7               32  5        32   superscript  5  2        6  1        7     \left\lfloor\frac{32}{5}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{32}{5^{2}}\right%

Defining        q  i   =   ⌊   n   5  i    ⌋    ,       subscript  q  i       n   superscript  5  i       q_{i}=\left\lfloor\frac{n}{5^{i}}\right\rfloor,\,     the following recurrence relation holds:      q  0     subscript  q  0    \displaystyle q_{0}     This can be used to simplify the computation of the terms of the summation, which can be stopped as soon as q i reaches zero.
