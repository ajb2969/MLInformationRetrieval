   Addition-subtraction chain      Addition-subtraction chain   An addition-subtraction chain , a generalization of addition chains to include subtraction, is a sequence  a 0 , a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , ... that satisfies        a  0   =  1   ,       subscript  a  0   1    a_{0}=1,\,             for  k   >  0   ,    a  k   =    a  i   ±    a  j   for some  0    ≤  i    ,   j  <  k    .     formulae-sequence   formulae-sequence      for  k   0        subscript  a  k    plus-or-minus   subscript  a  i      subscript  a  j   for some  0         i       j  k     \text{for }k>0,\ a_{k}=a_{i}\pm a_{j}\text{ for some }0\leq i,j     An addition-subtraction chain for n , of length L , is an addition-subtraction chain such that     a  L   =  n       subscript  a  L   n    a_{L}=n   . That is, one can thereby compute n by L additions and/or subtractions. (Note that n need not be positive. In this case, one may also include a -1 =0 in the sequence, so that n =-1 can be obtained by a chain of length 1.)  By definition, every addition chain is also an addition-subtraction chain, but not vice versa. Therefore, the length of the shortest addition-subtraction chain for n is bounded above by the length of the shortest addition chain for n . In general, however, the determination of a minimal addition-subtraction chain (like the problem of determining a minimum addition chain) is a difficult problem for which no efficient algorithms are currently known. The related problem of finding an optimal addition sequence is NP-complete (Downey et al., 1981), but it is not known for certain whether finding optimal addition or addition-subtraction chains is NP-hard .  For example, one addition-subtraction chain is     a  0   =  1       subscript  a  0   1    a_{0}=1   ,     a  1   =  2  =   1  +  1          subscript  a  1   2         1  1      a_{1}=2=1+1   ,     a  2   =  4  =   2  +  2          subscript  a  2   4         2  2      a_{2}=4=2+2   ,     a  3   =  3  =   4  -  1          subscript  a  3   3         4  1      a_{3}=3=4-1   . This is not a minimal addition-subtraction chain for n =3, however, because we could instead have chosen     a  2   =  3  =   2  +  1          subscript  a  2   3         2  1      a_{2}=3=2+1   . The smallest n for which an addition-subtraction chain is shorter than the minimal addition chain is n =31, which can be computed in only 6 additions (rather than 7 for the minimal addition chain):         a  0   =  1   ,    a  1   =  2  =   1  +  1     ,    a  2   =  4  =   2  +  2    ,    a  3   =  8  =   4  +  4    ,    a  4   =  16  =   8  +  8    ,    a  5   =  32  =   16  +  16    ,    a  6   =  31  =   32  -  1.       formulae-sequence   formulae-sequence     subscript  a  0   1        subscript  a  1   2         1  1           subscript  a  2   4         2  2          subscript  a  3   8         4  4          subscript  a  4   16         8  8          subscript  a  5   32         16  16          subscript  a  6   31         32  1.       a_{0}=1,\ a_{1}=2=1+1,\ a_{2}=4=2+2,\ a_{3}=8=4+4,\ a_{4}=16=8+8,\ a_{5}=32=16%
 +16,\ a_{6}=31=32-1.     Like an addition chain, an addition-subtraction chain can be used for addition-chain exponentiation : given the addition-subtraction chain of length L for n , the power    x  n     superscript  x  n    x^{n}   can be computed by multiplying or dividing by x  L times, where the subtractions correspond to divisions. This is potentially efficient in problems where division is an inexpensive operation, most notably for exponentiation on elliptic curves where division corresponds to a mere sign change (as proposed by Morain and Olivos, 1990).  Some hardware multipliers multiply by n using an addition chain described by n in binary:  n = 31 = 0  0  0  1   1  1  1  1 (binary).  Other hardware multipliers multiply by n using an addition-subtraction chain described by n in Booth encoding :  n = 31 = 0  0  1  0   0  0  0 -1 (Booth encoding).
