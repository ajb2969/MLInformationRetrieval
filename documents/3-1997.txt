   Analytical hierarchy      Analytical hierarchy   In mathematical logic and descriptive set theory , the analytical hierarchy is an extension of the arithmetical hierarchy . The analytical hierarchy of formulas includes formulas in the language of second-order arithmetic , which can have quantifiers over both the set of natural numbers ,   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   , and over functions from   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   to   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   . The analytical hierarchy of sets classifies sets by the formulas that can be used to define them; it is the lightface version of the projective hierarchy .  The analytical hierarchy of formulas  The notation     Σ  0  1   =   Π  0  1   =   Δ  0  1          subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   0    subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   0         subscript   superscript  normal-Δ  1   0      \Sigma^{1}_{0}=\Pi^{1}_{0}=\Delta^{1}_{0}   indicates the class of formulas in the language of second-order arithmetic with no set quantifiers. This language does not contain set parameters. The Greek letters here are lightface symbols, which indicate this choice of language. Each corresponding boldface symbol denotes the corresponding class of formulas in the extended language with a parameter for each real ; see projective hierarchy for details.  A formula in the language of second-order arithmetic is defined to be    Σ   n  +  1   1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1     n  1     \Sigma^{1}_{n+1}   if it is logically equivalent to a formula of the form    ∃    X  1   ⋯   ∃    X  k   ψ            subscript  X  1   normal-⋯       subscript  X  k   ψ       \exists X_{1}\cdots\exists X_{k}\psi   where   ψ   ψ   \psi   is    Π  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   n    \Pi^{1}_{n}   . A formula is defined to be    Π   n  +  1   1     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1     n  1     \Pi^{1}_{n+1}   if it is logically equivalent to a formula of the form    ∀    X  1   ⋯   ∀    X  k   ψ        for-all     subscript  X  1   normal-⋯   for-all     subscript  X  k   ψ       \forall X_{1}\cdots\forall X_{k}\psi   where   ψ   ψ   \psi   is    Σ  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   n    \Sigma^{1}_{n}   . This inductive definition defines the classes    Σ  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   n    \Sigma^{1}_{n}   and    Π  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   n    \Pi^{1}_{n}   for every natural number   n   n   n   .  Because every formula has a prenex normal form , every formula in the language of second-order arithmetic is    Σ  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   n    \Sigma^{1}_{n}   or    Π  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   n    \Pi^{1}_{n}   for some   n   n   n   . Because meaningless quantifiers can be added to any formula, once a formula is given the classification    Σ  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   n    \Sigma^{1}_{n}   or    Π  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   n    \Pi^{1}_{n}   for some   n   n   n   it will be given the classifications    Σ  m  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   m    \Sigma^{1}_{m}   and    Π  m  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   m    \Pi^{1}_{m}   for all   m   m   m   greater than   n   n   n   .  The analytical hierarchy of sets of natural numbers  A set of natural numbers is assigned the classification    Σ  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   n    \Sigma^{1}_{n}   if it is definable by a    Σ  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   n    \Sigma^{1}_{n}   formula. The set is assigned the classification    Π  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   n    \Pi^{1}_{n}   if it is definable by a    Π  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   n    \Pi^{1}_{n}   formula. If the set is both    Σ  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   n    \Sigma^{1}_{n}   and    Π  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   n    \Pi^{1}_{n}   then it is given the additional classification    Δ  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Δ  1   n    \Delta^{1}_{n}   .  The    Δ  1  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Δ  1   1    \Delta^{1}_{1}   sets are called hyperarithmetical . An alternate classification of these sets by way of iterated computable functionals is provided by hyperarithmetical theory .  The analytical hierarchy on subsets of Cantor and Baire space  The analytical hierarchy can be defined on any effective Polish space ; the definition is particularly simple for Cantor and Baire space because they fit with the language of ordinary second-order arithmetic. Cantor space is the set of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s; Baire space is the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers. These are both Polish spaces .  The ordinary axiomatization of second-order arithmetic uses a set-based language in which the set quantifiers can naturally be viewed as quantifying over Cantor space. A subset of Cantor space is assigned the classification    Σ  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   n    \Sigma^{1}_{n}   if it is definable by a    Σ  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   n    \Sigma^{1}_{n}   formula. The set is assigned the classification    Π  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   n    \Pi^{1}_{n}   if it is definable by a    Π  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   n    \Pi^{1}_{n}   formula. If the set is both    Σ  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   n    \Sigma^{1}_{n}   and    Π  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   n    \Pi^{1}_{n}   then it is given the additional classification    Δ  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Δ  1   n    \Delta^{1}_{n}   .  A subset of Baire space has a corresponding subset of Cantor space under the map that takes each function from   ω   ω   \omega   to   ω   ω   \omega   to the characteristic function of its graph. A subset of Baire space is given the classification    Σ  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   n    \Sigma^{1}_{n}   ,    Π  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   n    \Pi^{1}_{n}   , or    Δ  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Δ  1   n    \Delta^{1}_{n}   if and only if the corresponding subset of Cantor space has the same classification. An equivalent definition of the analytical hierarchy on Baire space is given by defining the analytical hierarchy of formulas using a functional version of second-order arithmetic; then the analytical hierarchy on subsets of Cantor space can be defined from the hierarchy on Baire space. This alternate definition gives exactly the same classifications as the first definition.  Because Cantor space is homeomorphic to any finite Cartesian power of itself, and Baire space is homeomorphic to any finite Cartesian power of itself, the analytical hierarchy applies equally well to finite Cartesian power of one of these spaces. A similar extension is possible for countable powers and to products of powers of Cantor space and powers of Baire space.  Extensions  As is the case with the arithmetical hierarchy , a relativized version of the analytical hierarchy can be defined. The language is extended to add a constant set symbol A . A formula in the extended language is inductively defined to be    Σ  n   1  ,  A      subscript   superscript  normal-Σ   1  A    n    \Sigma^{1,A}_{n}   or    Π  n   1  ,  A      subscript   superscript  normal-Π   1  A    n    \Pi^{1,A}_{n}   using the same inductive definition as above. Given a set   Y   Y   Y   , a set is defined to be    Σ  n   1  ,  Y      subscript   superscript  normal-Σ   1  Y    n    \Sigma^{1,Y}_{n}   if it is definable by a    Σ  n   1  ,  A      subscript   superscript  normal-Σ   1  A    n    \Sigma^{1,A}_{n}   formula in which the symbol   A   A   A   is interpreted as   Y   Y   Y   ; similar definitions for    Π  n   1  ,  Y      subscript   superscript  normal-Π   1  Y    n    \Pi^{1,Y}_{n}   and    Δ  n   1  ,  Y      subscript   superscript  normal-Δ   1  Y    n    \Delta^{1,Y}_{n}   apply. The sets that are    Σ  n   1  ,  Y      subscript   superscript  normal-Σ   1  Y    n    \Sigma^{1,Y}_{n}   or    Π  n   1  ,  Y      subscript   superscript  normal-Π   1  Y    n    \Pi^{1,Y}_{n}   , for any parameter Y , are classified in the projective hierarchy .  Examples   The set of all natural numbers which are indices of computable ordinals is a    Π  1  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   1    \Pi^{1}_{1}   set which is not    Σ  1  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   1    \Sigma^{1}_{1}   .    The set of elements of Cantor space which are the characteristic functions of well orderings of   ω   ω   \omega   is a    Π  1  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   1    \Pi^{1}_{1}   set which is not    Σ  1  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   1    \Sigma^{1}_{1}   . In fact, this set is not    Σ  1   1  ,  Y      subscript   superscript  normal-Σ   1  Y    1    \Sigma^{1,Y}_{1}   for any element   Y   Y   Y   of Baire space.    If the axiom of constructibility holds then there is a subset of the product of the Baire space with itself which is    Δ  2  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Δ  1   2    \Delta^{1}_{2}   and is the graph of a well ordering of Baire space. If the axiom holds then there is also a    Δ  2  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Δ  1   2    \Delta^{1}_{2}   well ordering of Cantor space.   Properties  For each   n   n   n   we have the following strict containments:       Π  n  1   ⊂   Σ   n  +  1   1        subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   n    subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1     n  1      \Pi^{1}_{n}\subset\Sigma^{1}_{n+1}   ,       Π  n  1   ⊂   Π   n  +  1   1        subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   n    subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1     n  1      \Pi^{1}_{n}\subset\Pi^{1}_{n+1}   ,       Σ  n  1   ⊂   Π   n  +  1   1        subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   n    subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1     n  1      \Sigma^{1}_{n}\subset\Pi^{1}_{n+1}   ,       Σ  n  1   ⊂   Σ   n  +  1   1        subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   n    subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1     n  1      \Sigma^{1}_{n}\subset\Sigma^{1}_{n+1}   .  A set that is in    Σ  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   n    \Sigma^{1}_{n}   for some n is said to be analytical . Care is required to distinguish this usage from the term analytic set which has a different meaning.
