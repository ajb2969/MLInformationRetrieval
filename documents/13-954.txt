   Smoothness (probability theory)      Smoothness (probability theory)   In probability theory and statistics , smoothness of a density function is a measure which determines how many times the density function can be differentiated, or equivalently the limiting behavior of distribution’s characteristic function .  Formally, we call the distribution of a random variable  X  ordinary smooth of order β  1 if its characteristic function satisfies         d  0     |  t  |    -  β     ≤    φ  X    (  t  )    ≤    d  1     |  t  |    -  β        as  t   →  ∞      formulae-sequence         subscript  d  0    superscript    t     β        subscript  φ  X   t           subscript  d  1    superscript    t     β        normal-→    as  t       d_{0}|t|^{-\beta}\leq\varphi_{X}(t)\leq d_{1}|t|^{-\beta}\quad\text{as }t\to\infty   for some positive constants d 0 , d 1 , β . The examples of such distributions are gamma , exponential , uniform , etc.  The distribution is called supersmooth of order β  2 if its characteristic function satisfies         d  0     |  t  |    β  0     exp   (   -     |  t  |   β   /  γ    )     ≤    φ  X    (  t  )    ≤    d  1     |  t  |    β  1     exp   (   -     |  t  |   β   /  γ    )        as  t   →  ∞      formulae-sequence         subscript  d  0    superscript    t    subscript  β  0           superscript    t   β   γ         subscript  φ  X   t           subscript  d  1    superscript    t    subscript  β  1           superscript    t   β   γ         normal-→    as  t       d_{0}|t|^{\beta_{0}}\exp\big(-|t|^{\beta}/\gamma\big)\leq\varphi_{X}(t)\leq d_%
 {1}|t|^{\beta_{1}}\exp\big(-|t|^{\beta}/\gamma\big)\quad\text{as }t\to\infty   for some positive constants d 0 , d 1 , β , γ and constants β 0 , β 1 . Such supersmooth distributions have derivatives of all orders. Examples: normal , Cauchy , mixture normal.  References     "  Category:Theory of probability distributions     ↩
