   Beta Cephei variable      Beta Cephei variable   Beta Cephei variables , also known as Beta Canis Majoris stars , are variable stars that exhibit small rapid variations in their brightness due to pulsations of the stars' surfaces, thought due to the unusual properties of iron at temperatures of 200,000 K in their interiors. These stars are usually hot blue-white stars of spectral class B and should not be confused with Cepheid variables , which are named after Delta Cephei and are luminous supergiant stars.  Properties  Beta Cephei variables are main-sequence stars of masses between about 7 and 20 M      ⊙     direct-product    {}_{\odot}    . Among their number are some of the brightest stars in the sky, such as Beta Crucis and Beta Centauri ; Spica is also classified as a Beta Cephei variable but mysteriously stopped pulsating in 1970. 1 Typically, they change in brightness by 0.01 to 0.3 magnitudes with periods of 0.1 to 0.3 days (2.4-7.2 hours). 2 The prototype of these variable stars, Beta Cephei , shows variation in apparent magnitude from +3.16 to +3.27 with a period of 4.57 hours. The point of maximum brightness occurs when the star is smallest and hottest. Their variation in brightness is much greater—up to 1 magnitude—in ultraviolet wavelengths. 3 A small number of stars have been identified with periods shorter than one hour, corresponding to 1/4 of the fundamental radial pulsation period and and 3/8 of the fundamental period. They also have relatively low amplitudes and a very narrow range of spectral types B2-3 IV-V. They are known as the short period group and the GCVS acronym BCEPS. 4 5  The pulsations of Beta Cephei variables are driven by the kappa mechanism and p-mode pulsations. At a depth within the star where the temperature reaches 200,000 K, there is an abundance of iron. Iron at these temperatures will increase (rather than decrease) in opacity, resulting in the buildup of energy within the layer. This results in increased pressure that pushes the layer back out again, the cycle repeating itself in a matter of hours. This is known as the Fe bump or Z bump (Z standing for the star's metallicity ). 6 The similar Slowly pulsating B stars show g-mode pulsations driven by the same iron opacity changes, but in less massive stars and with longer periods. 7  History of observations  American astronomer Edwin Brant Frost discovered the variation in radial velocity of Beta Cephei in 1902, initially concluding it was a spectroscopic binary. Paul Guthnick was the first to detect a variation in brightness, in 1913. 8 Beta Canis Majoris and Sigma Scorpii were found to be variable not long afterwards, 9  Vesto Slipher noted in 1904 that Sigma Scorpii's radial velocity was variable, and R.D. Levee and Otto Struve concluded this was due to the star's pulsations in 1952 and 1955 respectively. 10 These variables were often called Beta Canis Majoris variables because Beta Canis Majoris was the most closely-studied example in the first half of the 20th century, though its location in the southern sky meant that its lowness in the sky hampered observations. 11 However, Beta Cephei was the first member of the class to be discovered and so they are generally called Beta Cephei variables—despite the similarity of name (and risk of confusion) with Cepheid variables. 12  Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin and Sergei Gaposchkin catalogued 17 probable members of the class in their 1938 Variable Stars , though classified them with Delta Scuti variables . 13  16 Lacertae was another star extensively studied before 1952. 14 The number known jumped from 18 to 41 in 1966. 15  Otto Struve studied these stars extensively in the 1950s, however research declined after his death. 16  Christiaan L. Sterken and Mikolaj Jerzykiewicz classed 59 stars as definite and 79 more as suspected Beta Cephei variables in 1993. Stankov listed 93 members of the class in a 2005 catalogue, plus 77 candidates and 61 poor or rejected stars. 17 Six stars, namely Iota Herculis , 53 Piscium , Nu Eridani , Gamma Pegasi , HD 13745 (V354 Persei) and 53 Arietis had been found to exhibit both Beta Cephei and SPB variability. 18      Designation (name)   Constellation   Discovery   Maximum Apparent magnitude (m V ) 19   Minimum Apparent magnitude (m V ) 20   Period (hours) 21   Spectral class 22   Comment       β CMa   Canis Major   1909 ( William Wallace Campbell 23 )   1 m .93   2 m .00   6.031   B1II-III   Pulsations of 6.03, 6.00, and 4.74 hours. 24     ι CMa   Canis Major    4 m .36   4 m .40   33.6 25   B3Ib/II   Not considered a β Cep variable 26 27     ξ 1 CMa   Canis Major    4 m .33   4 m .36   5.030   B0.5IV        15 CMa   Canis Major    4 m .79   4 m .84   4.429   B1III-IV        FN CMa 28   Canis Major    5 m .38   5 m .42   36.7 29   B0.5IV   No longer considered a β Cep variable 30     χ Car 31   Carina    3 m .46    2.42   B2IV   Not considered a β Cep variable 32     V343 Car   Carina    4 m .30 33    57.11   B1.5III   Not considered a β Cep variable 34     V376 Car 35   Carina    4 m .91   4 m .96   0.4992   B2IV-V   BCEPS star     V372 Car   Carina    5 m .663   5 m .717   2.78   B2III        β Cen   Centaurus    0 m .565   0 m .655   3.684   B1II        ε Cen   Centaurus    2 m .29   2 m .31   4.070   B1V        κ Cen   Centaurus    3 m .13   3 m .14   2.288   B2IV        χ Cen 36   Centaurus    4 m .40 37    0.84   B2V   BCEPS star     β Cep   Cepheus   1902 ( Edwin Brant Frost ) 38   3 m .16   3 m .27   4.572   B2IIIe   Prototype     ζ Cha   Chamaeleon    5 m .06   5 m .17   25.91   B5V        δ Cet   Cetus    4 m .05   4 m .1   3.867   B2IV        β Cru   Crux    1 m .23   1 m .31   4.589   B0.5IV        δ Cru 39 40   Crux    2 m .78   2 m .84   3.625   B2IV      λ Cru   Crux    4 m .60   4 m .64   9.482 41   B4Vne   Not considered a β Cep variable 42     θ 2 Cru   Crux    4 m .70   4 m .74   2.134 43   B2IV   Not considered a β Cep variable 44     25 Cyg   Cygnus    5 m .09 45   5 m .21 46   5.04 47   B3IVe   γ Cas variable , not considered a β Cep variable 48     ν Eri   Eridanus    3 m .87   4 m .01   4.164   B2III   Multiperiodic; also a slowly pulsating B star     ι Her   Hercules    2 m .93     B3IV   No longer classed as Beta Cephei type 49     η Hya   Hydra    4 m .27   4 m .33   ~4 50   B3V   No longer classed as Beta Cephei type 51     12 Lac   Lacerta    5 m .16   5 m .28   4.634   B1.5III   Also a slowly pulsating B star     16 Lac   Lacerta    5 m .30 (B)   5 m .52 (B)   4.109   B2IV        α Lup   Lupus    2 m .29   2 m .34   6.235   B1.5III        δ Lup   Lupus    3 m .20   3 m .24   3.972   B2IV        ε Lup 52   Lupus    3 m .36   3 m .38   2.316   B2IV + B3V   Triple star system; primary is a spectroscopic binary     ι Lup   Lupus    3 m .54   3 m .3.55    B2.5IV        τ 1 Lup   Lupus    4 m .54   4 m .58   4.257   B2IV        19 Mon   Monoceros    4 m .96   5 m .01   4.589   B1IV-Vea        α Mus 53 54   Musca    2 m .68   2 m .73   2.167   B2IV-V      θ Oph   Ophiuchus    3 m .25   3 m .31   3.373   B2IV        η Ori   Orion    3 m .31   3 m .35   7.247   B0.5Vea + B3V   Quadruple star; also an Algol variable ; component Ab is the pulsating star     γ Peg   Pegasus   1953 ( D.
