   Diaminobutyrate—pyruvate transaminase      Diaminobutyrate—pyruvate transaminase   In enzymology , a diaminobutyrate-pyruvate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-2,4-diaminobutanoate + pyruvate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde + L-alanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-2,4-diaminobutanoate and pyruvate , whereas its two products are L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde and L-alanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-2,4-diaminobutanoate:pyruvate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include diaminobutyrate-pyruvate aminotransferase , and L-diaminobutyric acid transaminase . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .
