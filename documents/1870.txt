   Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re equation      Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re equation   Not be confused with the unconnected Monge equation .  In mathematics , a (real) Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re equation is a nonlinear second order partial differential equation of special kind. A second order equation for the unknown function u of two variables x , y is of Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re type if it is linear in the determinant of the Hessian matrix of u and in the second order partial derivatives of u . The independent variables ( x , y ) vary over a given domain D of R 2 . The term also applies to analogous equations with n independent variables. The most complete results so far have been obtained when the equation is elliptic .  Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re equations frequently arise in differential geometry , for example, in the Weyl and Minkowski problems in differential geometry of surfaces . They were first studied by Gaspard Monge in 1784 and later by Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re in 1820. Important results in the theory of Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re equations have been obtained by Sergei Bernstein , Aleksei Pogorelov , Charles Fefferman , and Louis Nirenberg .  Description  Given two independent variables x and y , and one dependent variable u , the general Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re equation is of the form       L   [  u  ]    =    A   (     u   x  x     u   y  y     -   u   x  y   2    )    +   B   u   x  x     +   2  C   u   x  y     +   D   u   y  y     +  E   =   0           L   delimited-[]  u        A       subscript  u    x  x     subscript  u    y  y      superscript   subscript  u    x  y    2       B   subscript  u    x  x       2  C   subscript  u    x  y       D   subscript  u    y  y     E        0     L[u]=A(u_{xx}u_{yy}-u_{xy}^{2})+Bu_{xx}+2Cu_{xy}+Du_{yy}+E=0\,     where A , B , C , D , and E are functions depending on the first order variables x , y , u , u x , and u y only.  Rellich's theorem  Let Œ© be a bounded domain in R 3 , and suppose that on Œ© A , B , C , D , and E are continuous functions of x and y only. Consider the Dirichlet problem to find u so that       L   [  u  ]    =   0  ,    on   Œ©          L   delimited-[]  u     0    on  normal-Œ©      L[u]=0,\quad\text{on}\ \Omega            u  |    ‚àÇ  Œ©    =  g   .       evaluated-at  u    normal-Œ©    g    u|_{\partial\Omega}=g.     If         B  D   -   C  2   -   A  E    >  0   ,          B  D    superscript  C  2     A  E    0    BD-C^{2}-AE>0,     then the Dirichlet problem has at most two solutions. 1  Ellipticity results  Suppose now that x is a variable with values in a domain in R n , and that f ( x , u , D 2 u ) is a positive function. Then the Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re equation        L   [  u  ]    =    det    D  2   u    -   f   (  ùê±  ,  u  ,   D  u   )     =  0    (  1  )      formulae-sequence        L   delimited-[]  u           superscript  D  2   u      f   ùê±  u    D  u           0    1    L[u]=\det D^{2}u-f(\mathbf{x},u,Du)=0\qquad\qquad(1)     is a nonlinear  elliptic partial differential equation (in the sense that its linearization is elliptic), provided one confines attention to convex solutions.  Accordingly, the operator L satisfies versions of the maximum principle , and in particular solutions to the Dirichlet problem are unique, provided they exist.  Applications  Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re equations arise naturally in several problems in Riemannian geometry , conformal geometry , and CR geometry . One of the simplest of these applications is to the problem of prescribed Gauss curvature . Suppose that a real-valued function K is specified on a domain Œ© in R n , the problem of prescribed Gauss curvature seeks to identify a hypersurface of R n+1 as a graph z = u ( x ) over x ‚ààŒ© so that, at each point of the surface the Gauss curvature is given by K ( x ). The resulting partial differential equation is        det    D  2   u    -   K   (  ùê±  )     (   1  +    |   D  u   |   2    )     (   n  +  2   )   /  2      =  0.             superscript  D  2   u      K  ùê±   superscript    1   superscript      D  u    2        n  2   2      0.    \det D^{2}u-K(\mathbf{x})(1+|Du|^{2})^{(n+2)/2}=0.     The Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re equations are related to the Monge-Kantorovich optimal mass transportation problem , when the "cost functional" therein is given by the Euclidean distance. 2  See also   Complex Monge-Amp√®re equation   References    Additional References   Gilbarg, D. and Trudinger, N.
