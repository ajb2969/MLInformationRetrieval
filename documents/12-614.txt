Trigonometric number

In mathematics, a trigonometric number1 is an irrational number produced by taking the sine or cosine of a rational multiple of a circle, or equivalently, the sine or cosine in radians of a rational multiple of π, or the sine or cosine of a rational number of degrees.
Ivan Niven gave proofs of theorems regarding these numbers.23 Li Zhou and Lubomir Markov4 recently improved and simplified Niven's proofs.
Any trigonometric number can be expressed in terms of radicals.5 For example,



Thus every trigonometric number is an algebraic number. This latter statement can be proved6 by starting with the statement of de Moivre's formula for the case of 
 
 
 
  for coprime k and n:



Expanding the left side and equating real parts gives an equation in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  substituting 
 
 
 
  gives a polynomial equation having 
 
 
 
  as a solution, so by definition the latter is an algebraic number. Also 
 
 
 
  is algebraic since it equals the algebraic number 
 
 
 
  Finally, 
 
 
 
  where again 
 
 
 
  is a rational multiple of 
 
 
 
  is algebraic as can be seen by equating the imaginary parts of the expansion of the de Moivre equation and dividing through by 
 
 
 
  to obtain a polynomial equation in
