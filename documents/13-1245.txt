Balanced polygamma function

In mathematics, the generalized polygamma function or balanced negapolygamma function is a function introduced by Olivier Espinosa Aldunate and Victor H. Moll.1
It generalizes the polygamma function to negative and fractional order, but remains equal to it for integer positive orders.
Definition
The generalized polygamma function is defined as follows:



or alternatively,



where 
 
 
 
  is the Polygamma function and 
 
 
 
  is the Hurwitz zeta function.
The function is balanced, in that it satisfies the conditions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Relations
Several special functions can be expressed in terms of generalized polygamma function.






























where 
 
 
 
  are Bernoulli polynomials





where K(z) is K-function and A is the Glaisher constant.
Special values
The balanced polygamma function can be expressed in a closed form at certain points:



 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Glaisher constant and 
 
 
 
  is the Catalan constant.
