   ∂      ∂   The character  ∂ ( html element : ∂ or ∂ , unicode : U+2202) or    ∂     \partial    is a stylized d mainly used as a mathematical symbol to denote a partial derivative such as     ∂  z    ∂  x         z     x     \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}   (read as "the partial derivative of z with respect to x "). The symbol was originally introduced by Legendre in 1786, but only gained popularity when it was used by Jacobi in 1841. 1  ∂ is also used to denote the following:   The Jacobian ,     ∂   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )     ∂   (  u  ,  v  ,  w  )          x  y  z     u  v  w     \frac{\partial(x,y,z)}{\partial(u,v,w)}   .  The boundary of a set in topology.  The boundary operator on a chain complex in homological algebra .  The boundary operator of a differential graded algebra .  The Dolbeault operator on complex differential forms .   The symbol may be referred to as "del", 2 "dee", 3 "partial dee", 4 "partial", "curly dee", 5 or "dabba". 6  The "curly d" symbol is sometimes called the "rounded d" or "curved d" or Jacobi’s delta. It corresponds to the cursive "dey" (equivalent to our d) in the Cyrillic alphabet. 7  References  "  Category:Mathematical terminology     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  Gokhale, Mujumdar, Kulkarni, Singh, Atal, Engineering Mathematics I , [ https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CbIqX6TxJVMC&pg; ;=SA10-PA2 p. 10.2], Nirali Prakashan ISBN 8190693549. ↩  ↩
