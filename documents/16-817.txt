   Equivariant sheaf      Equivariant sheaf   In mathematics, given the action    σ  :    G   ×  S   X   →  X      normal-:  σ   normal-→    subscript   S   G  X   X     \sigma:G\times_{S}X\to X   of a group scheme  G on a scheme (or stack ) X over a base scheme S , an equivariant sheaf  F on X is a sheaf of     𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   -modules together with the isomorphism of    𝒪   G   ×  S   X      subscript  𝒪    subscript   S   G  X     \mathcal{O}_{G\times_{S}X}   -modules      ϕ  :     σ  *   F   ≃    p  2  *   F       normal-:  ϕ   similar-to-or-equals     superscript  σ    F      superscript   subscript  p  2     F      \phi:\sigma^{*}F\simeq p_{2}^{*}F   that satisfies the cocycle condition: 1 writing m for multiplication,          p  23  *   ϕ   ∘    (    1  G   ×  σ   )   *    ϕ   =     (   m  ×   1  X    )   *   ϕ              superscript   subscript  p  23     ϕ    superscript     subscript  1  G   σ      ϕ      superscript    m   subscript  1  X      ϕ     p_{23}^{*}\phi\circ(1_{G}\times\sigma)^{*}\phi=(m\times 1_{X})^{*}\phi   . On the stalk level, the cocycle condition says that the isomorphism     F    g  h   ⋅  x    ≃   F  x      similar-to-or-equals   subscript  F   normal-⋅    g  h   x     subscript  F  x     F_{gh\cdot x}\simeq F_{x}   is the same as the composition     F   g  ⋅  h  ⋅  x    ≃   F   h  ⋅  x    ≃   F  x        similar-to-or-equals   subscript  F   normal-⋅  g  h  x     subscript  F   normal-⋅  h  x      similar-to-or-equals     subscript  F  x      F_{g\cdot h\cdot x}\simeq F_{h\cdot x}\simeq F_{x}   ; i.e., the associativity of the group action.  The unitarity of a group action, on the other hand, is a consequence: applying       (   e  ×  e  ×  1   )   *   ,  e   :   S  →  G      normal-:    superscript    e  e  1     e    normal-→  S  G     (e\times e\times 1)^{*},e:S\to G   to both sides gives        (   e  ×  1   )   *   ∘    (   e  ×  1   )   *    ϕ   =     (   e  ×  1   )   *   ϕ            superscript    e  1      superscript    e  1      ϕ      superscript    e  1     ϕ     (e\times 1)^{*}\circ(e\times 1)^{*}\phi=(e\times 1)^{*}\phi   and so      (   e  ×  1   )   *   ϕ       superscript    e  1     ϕ    (e\times 1)^{*}\phi   is the identity.  Note that   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is an additional data; it is "a lift" of the action of G on X to the sheaf F . A structure of an equivariant sheaf on a sheaf (namely   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   ) is also called a linearlization . In practice, one typically imposes further conditions; e.g., F is quasi-coherent, G is smooth and affine.  If the action of G is free, then the notion of an equivariant sheaf simplifies to a sheaf on the quotient X / G , because of the descent along torsors .  By Yoneda's lemma , to give the structure of an equivariant sheaf to an    𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   -module F is the same as to give group homomorphisms for rings R over   S   S   S   ,       G   (  R  )    →   Aut   (   X   ×  S    Spec  R    ,   F   ⊗  S   R   )       normal-→    G  R    Aut    subscript   S   X   Spec  R      subscript  tensor-product  S   F  R      G(R)\to\operatorname{Aut}(X\times_{S}\operatorname{Spec}R,F\otimes_{S}R)   . 2  Remark: There is also a definition of equivariant sheaves in terms of simplicial sheaves .  One example of an equivariant sheaf is a linearlized line bundle in geometric invariant theory . Another example is the sheaf of equivariant differential forms .  Equivariant vector bundle  A definition is simpler for a vector bundle (i.e., a variety corresponding to a locally free sheaf of constant rank). We say a vector bundle E on an algebraic variety X acted by an algebraic group G is equivariant if G acts fiberwise: i.e.,    g  :    E  x   →   E   g  x        normal-:  g   normal-→   subscript  E  x    subscript  E    g  x       g:E_{x}\to E_{gx}   is a "linear" isomorphism of vector spaces. 3 In other words, an equivariant vector bundle is a pair consisting of a vector bundle and the lifting of the action     G  ×  X   →  X     normal-→    G  X   X    G\times X\to X   to that of     G  ×  E   →  E     normal-→    G  E   E    G\times E\to E   so that the projection    E  →  X     normal-→  E  X    E\to X   is equivariant.  (Locally free sheaves and vector bundles correspond contravariantly. Thus, if V is a vector bundle corresponding to F , then   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   induces isomorphisms between fibers     V  x    →  ≃    V   g  x         subscript  V  x    similar-to-or-equals  normal-→    subscript  V    g  x      V_{x}\overset{\simeq}{\to}V_{gx}   , which are linear maps.)  Just like in the non-equivariant setting, one can define an equivariant characteristic class of an equivariant vector bundle.  Examples   The tangent bundle of a manifold or a smooth variety is an equivariant vector bundle.
