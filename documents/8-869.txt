Expander mixing lemma

The expander mixing lemma states that, for any two subsets

 
  of a d-regular expander graph

 
  with 
 
 
 
  vertices, the number of edges between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is approximately what you would expect in a random d-regular graph, i.e. 
 
 
 
 .
Statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be a d-regular graph on n vertices with 
 
 
 
  the second-largest eigenvalue (in absolute value) of the normalized adjacency matrix. For any two subsets 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be the number of edges between S and T (counting edges contained in the intersection of S and T twice). Then



Proof
Let 
 
 
 
  be the adjacency matrix for 
 
 
 
 . For a vertex subset 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
 . Here 
 
 
 
  is the standard basis element of 
 
 
 
  with a one in the 
 
 
 
  position. Thus in particular 
 
 
 
 , and the number of edges between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 .
Expand each of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  into a component in the direction of the largest-eigenvalue eigenvector 
 
 
 
  and an orthogonal component:





 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
 . Then


 
 .
The conclusion follows, since 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 .
Converse
Bilu and Linial showed that the converse holds as well: if a graph satisfies the conclusion of the expander mixing lemma, that is, for any two subsets 
 
 
 
 ,



then its second-largest eigenvalue is 
 
 
 
 .
