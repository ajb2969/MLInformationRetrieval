Inositol-tetrakisphosphate 1-kinase

In enzymology, an inositol-tetrakisphosphate 1-kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + 1D-myo-inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate 
 
 
 
  ADP + 1D-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 1D-myo-inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate, whereas its two products are ADP and 1D-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:1D-myo-inositol-3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate 1-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include 1D-myo-inositol-tetrakisphosphate 1-kinase, inositol-trisphosphate 6-kinase, 1D-myo-inositol-trisphosphate 6-kinase, ATP:1D-myo-inositol-1,3,4-trisphosphate 6-phosphotransferase, inositol-trisphosphate 5-kinase, 1D-myo-inositol-trisphosphate 5-kinase, and ATP:1D-myo-inositol-1,3,4-trisphosphate 5-phosphotransferase. This enzyme participates in inositol phosphate metabolism and phosphatidylinositol signaling system.
