   Substitution tiling      Substitution tiling   In geometry, a tile substitution is a method for constructing highly ordered tilings . Most importantly, some tile substitutions generate aperiodic tilings , which are tilings whose prototiles do not admit any tiling with translational symmetry . The most famous of these are the Penrose tilings . Substitution tilings are special cases of finite subdivision rules , which do not require the tiles to be geometrically rigid.  Introduction  A tile substitution is described by a set of prototiles (tile shapes)     T  1   ,   T  2   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   T  m       subscript  T  1    subscript  T  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  T  m     T_{1},T_{2},\dots,T_{m}   , an expanding map    Q   Q   Q   and a dissection rule showing how to dissect the expanded prototiles    Q   T  i       Q   subscript  T  i     QT_{i}   to form copies of some prototiles    T  j     subscript  T  j    T_{j}   . Intuitively, higher and higher iterations of tile substitution produce a tiling of the plane called a substitution tiling . Some substitution tilings are periodic , defined as having translational symmetry . Among the nonperiodic substitution tilings are some aperiodic tilings , those whose prototiles cannot be rearranged to form a periodic tiling (usually if one requires in addition some matching rules).  A simple example that produces a periodic tiling has only one prototile, namely a square:   (Figure)  subst-square.png    By iterating this tile substitution, larger and larger regions of the plane are covered with a square grid. A more sophisticated example with two prototiles is shown below, with the two steps of blowing up and dissecting are merged into one step in the figure.   (Figure)  subst-haus.png    One may intuitively get an idea how this procedure yields a substitution tiling of the entire plane . A mathematically proper definition is given below. Substitution tilings are notably useful as ways of defining aperiodic tilings , which are objects of interest in many fields of mathematics , including automata theory , combinatorics , discrete geometry , dynamical systems , group theory , harmonic analysis and number theory , not to mention the impact which were induced by those tilings in crystallography and chemistry . In particular, the celebrated Penrose tiling is an example of an aperiodic substitution tiling.  History  In 1973 and 1974, Roger Penrose discovered a family of aperiodic tilings, now called Penrose tilings . The first description was given in terms of 'matching rules' treating the prototiles as jigsaw puzzle pieces. The proof that copies of these prototiles can be put together to form a tiling of the plane, but cannot do so periodically, uses a construction that can be cast as a substitution tiling of the prototiles. In 1977 Robert Ammann discovered a number of sets of aperiodic prototiles, i.e., prototiles with matching rules forcing nonperiodic tilings; in particular, he rediscovered Penrose's first example. This work gave an impact to scientists working in crystallography , eventually leading to the discovery of quasicrystals . In turn, the interest in quasicrystals led to the discovery of several well-ordered aperiodic tilings. Many of them can be easily described as substitution tilings.  Mathematical definition  We will consider regions in    ‚Ñù  d     superscript  ‚Ñù  d    {\mathbb{R}}^{d}   that are well-behaved , in the sense that a region is a nonempty compact subset that is the closure of its interior .  We take a set of regions    ‚Ñô  =   {   T  1   ,   T  2   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   T  m   }       ‚Ñô    subscript  T  1    subscript  T  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  T  m      \mathbb{P}=\{T_{1},T_{2},\dots,T_{m}\}   as prototiles. A placement of a prototile    T  i     subscript  T  i    T_{i}   is a pair    (   T  i   ,  œÜ  )      subscript  T  i   œÜ    (T_{i},\varphi)   where   œÜ   œÜ   \varphi   is an isometry of    ‚Ñù  d     superscript  ‚Ñù  d    {\mathbb{R}}^{d}   . The image    œÜ   (   T  i   )       œÜ   subscript  T  i     \varphi(T_{i})   is called the placement's region. A tiling T is a set of prototile placements whose regions have pairwise disjoint interiors. We say that the tiling T is a tiling of W where W is the union of the regions of the placements in T .  A tile substitution is often loosely defined in the literature. A precise definition is as follows. 1  A tile substitution with respect to the prototiles P is a pair    (  Q  ,  œÉ  )     Q  œÉ    (Q,\sigma)   , where    Q  :    ‚Ñù  d   ‚Üí   ‚Ñù  d       normal-:  Q   normal-‚Üí   superscript  ‚Ñù  d    superscript  ‚Ñù  d      Q:{\mathbb{R}}^{d}\to{\mathbb{R}}^{d}   is a linear map , all of whose eigenvalues are larger than one in modulus, together with a substitution rule    œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   that maps each    T  i     subscript  T  i    T_{i}   to a tiling of    Q   T  i       Q   subscript  T  i     QT_{i}   . The tile substitution   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   induces a map from any tiling T of a region W to a tiling    œÉ   (  ùïã  )       œÉ  ùïã    \sigma(\mathbb{T})   of     Q  œÉ    (  ùïé  )        subscript  Q  œÉ   ùïé    Q_{\sigma}(\mathbb{W})   , defined by        œÉ   (  ùïã  )    =    ‚ãÉ    (   T  i   ,  œÜ  )   ‚àà  ùïã     {   (   T  j   ,   Q  ‚àò  œÜ  ‚àò   Q   -  1    ‚àò  œÅ   )   :    (   T  j   ,  œÅ  )   ‚àà   œÉ   (   T  i   )     }     .        œÉ  ùïã     subscript       subscript  T  i   œÜ   ùïã     conditional-set    subscript  T  j     Q  œÜ   superscript  Q    1    œÅ        subscript  T  j   œÅ     œÉ   subscript  T  i         \sigma(\mathbb{T})=\bigcup_{(T_{i},\varphi)\in\mathbb{T}}\{(T_{j},Q\circ%
 \varphi\circ Q^{-1}\circ\rho):(T_{j},\rho)\in\sigma(T_{i})\}.     Note, that the prototiles can be deduced from the tile substitution. Therefore it is not necessary to include them in the tile substitution    (  Q  ,  œÉ  )     Q  œÉ    (Q,\sigma)   . 2  Every tiling of    ‚Ñù  d     superscript  ‚Ñù  d    {\mathbb{R}}^{d}   , where any finite part of it is congruent to a subset of some     œÉ  k    (   T  i   )        superscript  œÉ  k    subscript  T  i     \sigma^{k}(T_{i})   is called a substitution tiling (for the tile substitution    (  Q  ,  œÉ  )     Q  œÉ    (Q,\sigma)   ).
