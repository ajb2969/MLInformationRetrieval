   Methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase      Methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin + coenzyme F 420    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5,10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin + reduced coenzyme F 420    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin and coenzyme F420 , whereas its two products are 5,10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin and reduced coenzyme F420.  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin:coenzyme-F420 oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include N5,N10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase , and 5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in folate biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
