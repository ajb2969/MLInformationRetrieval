   TRNA (adenine-N1-)-methyltransferase      TRNA (adenine-N1-)-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a tRNA (adenine-N1-)-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + tRNA containing N 1 -methyladenine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and tRNA , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and tRNA containing N1-methyl adenine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (adenine-N1-)-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include transfer ribonucleate adenine 1-methyltransferase , transfer RNA (adenine-1) methyltransferase , 1-methyladenine transfer RNA methyltransferase , adenine-1-methylase , and S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (adenine-1-N-)-methyltransferase .
