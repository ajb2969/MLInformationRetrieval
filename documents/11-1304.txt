   Limonoid glucosyltransferase      Limonoid glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a limonoid glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + limonin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glucosyl-limonin + UDP   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and limonin , whereas its two products are glucosyl-limonin and UDP .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is uridine diphosphoglucose-limonoid glucosyltransferase .
