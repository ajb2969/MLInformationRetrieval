BF model

The BF model is a topological field theory, which when quantized, becomes a topological quantum field theory. BF stands for background field. B and F, as can be seen below, are also the variables appearing in the Lagrangian of the theory, which is helpful as a mnemonic device.
We have a 4-dimensional differentiable manifold M, a gauge group G, which has as "dynamical" fields a two-form B taking values in the adjoint representation of G, and a connection form A for G.
The action is given by



where K is an invariant nondegenerate bilinear form over 
 
 
 
  (if G is semisimple, the Killing form will do) and F is the curvature form



This action is diffeomorphically invariant and gauge invariant. Its Eulerâ€“Lagrange equations are


 
  (no curvature)
and


 
  (the covariant exterior derivative of B is zero).
In fact, it is always possible to gauge away any local degrees of freedom, which is why it is called a topological field theory.
However, if M is topologically nontrivial, A and B can have nontrivial solutions globally.
