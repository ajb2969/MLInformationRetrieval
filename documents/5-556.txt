   BF model      BF model   The BF model is a topological field theory , which when quantized , becomes a topological quantum field theory . BF stands for background field . B and F, as can be seen below, are also the variables appearing in the Lagrangian of the theory, which is helpful as a mnemonic device.  We have a 4-dimensional differentiable manifold M, a gauge group G, which has as "dynamical" fields a two-form  B taking values in the adjoint representation of G, and a connection form  A for G.  The action is given by      S  =    ∫  M    K   [   𝐁  ∧  𝐅   ]         S    subscript   M     K   delimited-[]    𝐁  𝐅        S=\int_{M}K[\mathbf{B}\wedge\mathbf{F}]     where K is an invariant nondegenerate  bilinear form over   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   (if G is semisimple , the Killing form will do) and F is the curvature form      𝐅  ≡     d  𝐀   +  𝐀   ∧  𝐀       𝐅        d  𝐀   𝐀   𝐀     \mathbf{F}\equiv d\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{A}\wedge\mathbf{A}     This action is diffeomorphically invariant and gauge invariant . Its Euler–Lagrange equations are      𝐅  =  0      𝐅  0    \mathbf{F}=0   (no curvature)  and        d  𝐀   B   =  0         subscript  d  𝐀   B   0    d_{\mathbf{A}}B=0   (the covariant exterior derivative of B is zero).  In fact, it is always possible to gauge away any local degrees of freedom, which is why it is called a topological field theory.  However, if M is topologically nontrivial, A and B can have nontrivial solutions globally.
