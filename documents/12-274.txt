   FSC15307+3253      FSC15307+3253   FSC15307+3253 1 is an Ultra- Luminous InfraRed Galaxy (ULIRG), with a luminosity between 8 and 1000 µm of approximately 2     ×    10  1   3       absent     superscript  10  1   3     \times 10^{1}3    L ⊙ , possibly the largest known at this time. The "FSC" refers to Faint Source Catalogue , one of the source catalogs produced by the IRAS infrared survey mission. The emission is believed due to some combination of starburst activity and accretion onto a super-massive black hole , producing primary radiation at shorter wavelengths which is mostly blocked by obscuring dust, which is in turn heated and re-radiates in the infrared . The redshift of the source is    z  =  0.93      z  0.93    z=0.93   , indicating a distance of the order of 7 billion light years.
