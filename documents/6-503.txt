   Steinhart–Hart equation      Steinhart–Hart equation   The Steinhart–Hart equation is a model of the resistance of a semiconductor at different temperatures . The equation is:        1  T   =   A  +   B   ln   (  R  )     +   C    [   ln   (  R  )    ]   3      ,        1  T     A    B    R      C   superscript   delimited-[]    R    3       {1\over T}=A+B\ln(R)+C[\ln(R)]^{3},     where:      T   T   T   is the temperature (in Kelvins)     R   R   R   is the resistance at T (in ohms)     A   A   A   ,   B   B   B   , and   C   C   C   are the Steinhart–Hart coefficients which vary depending on the type and model of thermistor and the temperature range of interest. (The most general form of the applied equation contains a     [   ln   (  R  )    ]   2     superscript   delimited-[]    R    2    [\ln(R)]^{2}   term, but this is frequently neglected because it is typically much smaller than the other coefficients, and is therefore not shown above.)   Uses of the equation  The equation is often used to derive a precise temperature of a thermistor since it provides a closer approximation to actual temperature than simpler equations, and is useful over the entire working temperature range of the sensor. Steinhart–Hart coefficients are usually published by thermistor manufacturers.  Where Steinhart–Hart coefficients are not available, they can be derived. Three accurate measures of resistance are made at precise temperatures, then the coefficients are derived by solving three simultaneous equations .  Inverse of the equation  To find the resistance of a semiconductor given the temperature the inverse of the Steinhart–Hart equation must be used. See the Application Note , "A, B, C Coefficients for Steinhart–Hart Equation".

For this, we use three values of resistance data for three known temperatures.
