   Alanine—tRNA ligase      Alanine—tRNA ligase   In enzymology , an alanine-tRNA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-alanine + tRNAAla   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + L-alanyl-tRNAAla   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , L-alanine , and tRNA(Ala) , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and L-alanyl-tRNA(Ala) .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , to be specific those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in aminoacyl-tRNA and related compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-alanine:tRNAAla ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include alanyl-tRNA synthetase , alanyl-transfer ribonucleate synthetase , alanyl-transfer RNA synthetase , alanyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase , alanine-transfer RNA ligase , alanine transfer RNA synthetase , alanine tRNA synthetase , alanine translase , alanyl-transfer ribonucleate synthase , AlaRS , and Ala-tRNA synthetase . This enzyme participates in alanine and aspartate metabolism and aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis .
