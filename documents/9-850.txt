Height of a polynomial

In mathematics, the height and length of a polynomial P with complex coefficients are measures of its "size".
For a polynomial P of degree n given by



the height H(P) is defined to be the maximum of the magnitudes of its coefficients:



and the length L(P) is similarly defined as the sum of the magnitudes of the coefficients:



The Mahler measure M(P) of P is also a measure of the size of P. The three functions H(P), L(P) and M(P) are related by the inequalities
