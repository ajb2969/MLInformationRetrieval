   Peetre theorem      Peetre theorem   In mathematics , the (linear) Peetre theorem, named after Jaak Peetre , is a result of functional analysis that gives a characterisation of differential operators in terms of their effect on generalized function spaces , and without mentioning differentiation in explicit terms. The Peetre theorem is an example of a finite order theorem in which a function or a functor , defined in a very general way, can in fact be shown to be a polynomial because of some extraneous condition or symmetry imposed upon it.  This article treats two forms of the Peetre theorem. The first is the original version which, although quite useful in its own right, is actually too general for most applications.  The original Peetre theorem  Let M be a smooth manifold and let E and F be two vector bundles on M . Let        Γ  ∞    (  E  )    ,    and    Γ  ∞    (  F  )          superscript  normal-Γ    E     and   superscript  normal-Γ    F     \Gamma^{\infty}(E),\ \hbox{and}\ \Gamma^{\infty}(F)   be the spaces of smooth sections of E and F . An operator      D  :     Γ  ∞    (  E  )    →    Γ  ∞    (  F  )        normal-:  D   normal-→     superscript  normal-Γ    E      superscript  normal-Γ    F      D:\Gamma^{\infty}(E)\rightarrow\Gamma^{\infty}(F)   is a morphism of sheaves which is linear on sections such that the support of D is non-increasing : supp Ds ⊆ supp s for every smooth section s of E . The original Peetre theorem asserts that, for every point p in M , there is a neighborhood U of p and an integer k (depending on U ) such that D is a differential operator of order k over U . This means that D factors through a linear mapping i D from the k - jet of sections of E into the space of smooth sections of F :      D  =    i  D   ∘   j  k        D     subscript  i  D    superscript  j  k      D=i_{D}\circ j^{k}   where       j  k   :     Γ  ∞   E   →    J  k   E       normal-:   superscript  j  k    normal-→     superscript  normal-Γ    E      superscript  J  k   E      j^{k}:\Gamma^{\infty}E\rightarrow J^{k}E   is the k -jet operator and       i  D   :     J  k   E   →  F      normal-:   subscript  i  D    normal-→     superscript  J  k   E   F     i_{D}:J^{k}E\rightarrow F   is a linear mapping of vector bundles.  Proof  The problem is invariant under local diffeomorphism, so it is sufficient to prove it when M is an open set in R n and E and F are trivial bundles. At this point, it relies primarily on two lemmas:   Lemma 1. If the hypotheses of the theorem are satisfied, then for every x ∈ M and C > 0, there exists a neighborhood V of x and a positive integer k such that for any y ∈ V \{ x } and for any section s of E whose k -jet vanishes at y ( j k s ( y )=0), we have | Ds ( y )| x lemma="" 1.="" 2. ="" :suppose="" a="" begin="" false.="" first="" is="" lemma="" of="" proof="" prove="" sequence="" sufficient="" the="" then="" theorem.="" there="" to="" we="" with="">k tending to x , and a sequence of very disjoint balls B k around the x k (meaning that the geodesic distance between any two such balls is non-zero), and sections s k of E over each B k such that j k s k ( x k )=0 but | Ds k ( x k )|≥C>0.   Let ρ( x ) denote a standard bump function for the unit ball at the origin: a smooth real-valued function which is equal to 1 on B 1/2 (0), which vanishes to infinite order on the boundary of the unit ball.    Consider every other section s 2k . At x 2k , these satisfy  j 2k s 2k ( x 2k )=0.    Suppose that 2k is given. Then, since these functions are smooth and each satisfy j 2k ( s 2k )( x 2k )=0, it is possible to specify a smaller ball B′ δ ( x 2k ) such that the higher order derivatives obey the following estimate:        ∑    |  α  |   ≤  k       sup   y  ∈    B  δ  ′    (   x   2  k    )       |     ∇  α    s  k     (  y  )    |     ≤    1   M  k      (   δ  2   )   k          subscript       α   k      subscript  supremum    y     subscript   superscript  B  normal-′   δ    subscript  x    2  k             superscript  normal-∇  α    subscript  s  k    y          1   subscript  M  k     superscript    δ  2   k      \sum_{|\alpha|\leq k}\ \sup_{y\in B^{\prime}_{\delta}(x_{2k})}|\nabla^{\alpha}%
 s_{k}(y)|\leq\frac{1}{M_{k}}\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)^{k}      where       M  k   =    ∑    |  α  |   ≤  k     sup   |    ∇  α   ρ   |      .       subscript  M  k     subscript       α   k     supremum      superscript  normal-∇  α   ρ        M_{k}=\sum_{|\alpha|\leq k}\sup|\nabla^{\alpha}\rho|.        Now       ρ   2  k     (  y  )    :=   ρ   (    y  -   x   2  k     δ   )       assign     subscript  ρ    2  k    y     ρ      y   subscript  x    2  k     δ      \rho_{2k}(y):=\rho\left(\frac{y-x_{2k}}{\delta}\right)      is a standard bump function supported in B′ δ ( x 2k ), and the derivative of the product s 2k ρ 2k is bounded in such a way that         max    |  α  |   ≤  k       sup   y  ∈    B  δ  ′    (   x   2  k    )       |    ∇  α    (    ρ   2  k     s   2  k     )    |     ≤   2   -  k     .         subscript       α   k      subscript  supremum    y     subscript   superscript  B  normal-′   δ    subscript  x    2  k           superscript  normal-∇  α      subscript  ρ    2  k     subscript  s    2  k          superscript  2    k      \max_{|\alpha|\leq k}\ \sup_{y\in B^{\prime}_{\delta}(x_{2k})}|\nabla^{\alpha}%
 (\rho_{2k}s_{2k})|\leq 2^{-k}.      As a result, because the following series and all of the partial sums of its derivatives converge uniformly       q   (  y  )    =    ∑   k  =  1   ∞     ρ   2  k     (  y  )    s   2  k     (  y  )      ,        q  y     superscript   subscript     k  1         subscript  ρ    2  k    y   subscript  s    2  k    y      q(y)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\rho_{2k}(y)s_{2k}(y),      q ( y ) is a smooth function on all of V .    We now observe that since s 2k and   ρ   ρ   \rho    2k s 2k are equal in a neighborhood of x 2k ,       lim   k  →  ∞     |   D  q   (   x   2  k    )    |    ≥  C        subscript    normal-→  k         D  q   subscript  x    2  k       C    \lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}|Dq(x_{2k})|\geq C      So by continuity | Dq ( x )|≥ C>0. On the other hand,       lim   k  →  ∞     D  q   (   x    2  k   +  1    )     =  0        subscript    normal-→  k       D  q   subscript  x      2  k   1      0    \lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}Dq(x_{2k+1})=0      since Dq ( x 2k+1 )=0 because q is identically zero in B 2k+1 and D is support non-increasing. So Dq ( x )=0. This is a contradiction.   We now prove Lemma 2.   First, let us dispense with the constant C from the first lemma. We show that, under the same hypotheses as Lemma 1, |Ds(y)|=0. Pick a y in V \{ x } so that j k s (y)=0 but | Ds ( y )|= g >0. Rescale s by a factor of 2 C /g. Then if g is non-zero, by the linearity of D , | Ds ( y )|=2 C > C , which is impossible by Lemma 1. This proves the theorem in the punctured neighborhood V \{ x }.    Now, we must continue the differential operator to the central point x in the punctured neighborhood. D is a linear differential operator with smooth coefficients. Furthermore, it sends germs of smooth functions to germs of smooth functions at x as well. Thus the coefficients of D are also smooth at x .   A specialized application  Let M be a compact  smooth manifold (possibly with boundary ), and E and F be finite dimensional vector bundles on M . Let       Γ  ∞    (  E  )        superscript  normal-Γ    E    \Gamma^{\infty}(E)   be the collection of smooth sections of E . An operator      D  :     Γ  ∞    (  E  )    →    Γ  ∞    (  F  )        normal-:  D   normal-→     superscript  normal-Γ    E      superscript  normal-Γ    F      D:\Gamma^{\infty}(E)\rightarrow\Gamma^{\infty}(F)     is a smooth function (of Fréchet manifolds ) which is linear on the fibres and respects the base point on M :        π  ∘   D  p    =  p   .        π   subscript  D  p    p    \pi\circ D_{p}=p.     The Peetre theorem asserts that for each operator D , there exists an integer k such that D is a differential operator of order k . Specifically, we can decompose      D  =    i  D   ∘   j  k        D     subscript  i  D    superscript  j  k      D=i_{D}\circ j^{k}     where    i  D     subscript  i  D    i_{D}   is a mapping from the jets of sections of E to the bundle F .
