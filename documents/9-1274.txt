   Minimal volume      Minimal volume   In mathematics , in particular in differential geometry , the minimal volume is a number that describes one aspect of a Riemannian manifold 's topology . This topological invariant was introduced by Mikhail Gromov .  Definition  Consider a closed  orientable  connected smooth manifold     M  n     superscript  M  n    M^{n}   with a smooth Riemannian metric    g   g   g   , and define    V  o  l   (  M  ,  g  )       V  o  l   M  g     Vol({\it M,g})   to be the volume of a manifold   M   M   M   with the metric   g   g   g   . Let    K  g     subscript  K  g    K_{g}   represent the sectional curvature .  The minimal volume of   M   M   M   is a smooth invariant defined as       M  i  n  V  o  l   (  M  )    :=    inf  g    {   V  o  l   (  M  ,  g  )    :    |   K  g   |   ≤  1   }       assign    M  i  n  V  o  l  M     subscript  infimum  g    conditional-set    V  o  l   M  g         subscript  K  g    1       MinVol(M):=\inf_{g}\{Vol(M,g):|K_{g}|\leq 1\}     that is, the infimum of the volume of   M   M   M   over all metrics with bounded sectional curvature.  Clearly, any manifold   M   M   M   may be given an arbitrarily small volume by selecting a Riemannian metric   g   g   g   and scaling it down to    λ  g      λ  g    \lambda g   , as     V  o  l   (  M  ,   λ  g   )    =    λ   n  /  2    V  o  l   (  M  ,  g  )          V  o  l   M    λ  g        superscript  λ    n  2    V  o  l   M  g      Vol(M,\lambda g)=\lambda^{n/2}Vol(M,g)   . For a meaningful definition of minimal volume, it is thus necessary to prevent such scaling. The inclusion of bounds on sectional curvature suffices, as     K   λ  g    =    1  λ    K  g         subscript  K    λ  g        1  λ    subscript  K  g      \textstyle K_{\lambda g}=\frac{1}{\lambda}K_{g}   . If     M  i  n  V  o  l   (  M  )    =  0        M  i  n  V  o  l  M   0    MinVol(M)=0   , then    M  n     superscript  M  n    M^{n}   can be "collapsed" to a manifold of lower dimension (and thus one with   n   n   n   -dimensional volume zero) by a series of appropriate metrics; this manifold may be considered the Hausdorff limit of the related sequence, and the bounds on sectional curvature ensure that this convergence takes place in a topologically meaningful fashion.  Related topological invariants  The minimal volume invariant is connected to other topological invariants in a fundamental way; via Chern–Weil theory , there are many topological invariants which can be described by integrating polynomials in the curvature over   M   M   M   . In particular, the Chern classes and Pontryagin classes are bounded above by the minimal volume.  Properties  Gromov has conjectured that every closed simply connected odd-dimensional manifold has zero minimal volume. This conjecture clearly does not hold for even-dimensional manifolds .
