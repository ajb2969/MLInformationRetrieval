Thermospermine synthase

Thermospermine synthase (, TSPMS, ACL5, SAC51) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosylmethioninamine:spermidine 3-aminopropyltransferase (thermospermine synthesizing).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosylmethioninamine + spermidine

 
  S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine + thermospermine + H+


This enzyme is required for correct xylem specification through regulation of the lifetime of the xylem elements.
