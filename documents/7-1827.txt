   Adjunction (field theory)      Adjunction (field theory)   In abstract algebra , adjunction is a construction in field theory , where for a given field extension  E / F , subextensions between E and F are constructed.  Definition  Let E be a field extension of a field  F . Given a set of elements A in the larger field E we denote by F ( A ) the smallest subextension which contains the elements of A . We say F ( A ) is constructed by adjunction of the elements A to F or generated by A .  If A is finite we say F ( A ) is finitely generated and if A consists of a single element we say F ( A ) is a simple extension . The primitive element theorem states a finite separable extension is simple.  In a sense, a finitely generated extension is a transcendental generalization of a finite extension since, if the generators in A are all algebraic, then F ( A ) is a finite extension of F . Because of this, most examples come from algebraic geometry .  A subextension of a finitely generated field extension is also a finitely generated extension. 1  Notes  F ( A ) consists of all those elements of E that can be constructed using a finite number of field operations +, -, *, / applied to elements from F and A . For this reason F ( A ) is sometimes called the field of rational expressions in F and A .  Examples   Given a field extension E / F then F (Ø) = F and F ( E ) = E .  The complex numbers are constructed by adjunction of the imaginary unit to the real numbers , that is C = R (i).   Properties  Given a field extension E / F and a subset A of E , let   𝒯   𝒯   \mathcal{T}   be the family of all finite subsets of A . Then       F   (  A  )    =    ⋃   T  ∈  𝒯     F   (  T  )           F  A     subscript     T  𝒯      F  T      F(A)=\bigcup_{T\in\mathcal{T}}F(T)   . In other words the adjunction of any set can be reduced to a union of adjunctions of finite sets.  Given a field extension E / F and two subsets N , M of E then K ( M ∪ N ) = ( K ( M ))( N ) = ( K ( N ))( M ). This shows that any adjunction of a finite set can be reduced to a successive adjunction of single elements.  References  "  Category:Field theory     . ↩
