   Slash distribution      Slash distribution   In probability theory , the slash distribution is the probability distribution of a standard normal variate divided by an independent standard uniform variate. 1 In other words, if the random variable  Z has a normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance , the random variable U has a uniform distribution on [0,1] and Z and U are statistically independent , then the random variable X = Z / U has a slash distribution. The slash distribution is an example of a ratio distribution . The distribution was named by William H. Rogers and John Tukey in a paper published in 1972. 2  The probability density function (pdf) is        f   (  x  )    =     φ   (  0  )    -   φ   (  x  )      x  2     .        f  x         φ  0     φ  x     superscript  x  2      f(x)=\frac{\varphi(0)-\varphi(x)}{x^{2}}.     where φ( x ) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution. 3 The result is undefined at x = 0, but the discontinuity is removable :        lim   x  →  0     f   (  x  )     =    φ   (  0  )    2   =   1   2    2  π              subscript    normal-→  x  0      f  x        φ  0   2          1    2      2  π         \lim_{x\to 0}f(x)=\frac{\varphi(0)}{2}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2\pi}}     The most common use of the slash distribution is in simulation studies. It is a useful distribution in this context because it has heavier tails than a normal distribution, but it is not as pathological as the Cauchy distribution . 4  Differential equation  The pdf of the slash distribution is a solution of the following differential equation :      {          2   π   x   f  ′    (  x  )    +   2   π    (    x  2   +  2   )   f   (  x  )     -   2    =  0   ,         f   (  1  )    =    1    2  π     -   1    2  e  π          }               2    π   x   superscript  f  normal-′   x     2    π      superscript  x  2   2   f  x      2    0         f  1       1      2  π       1      2  e  π           \left\{\begin{array}[]{l}2\sqrt{\pi}xf^{\prime}(x)+2\sqrt{\pi}\left(x^{2}+2%
 \right)f(x)-\sqrt{2}=0,\\
 f(1)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2e\pi}}\end{array}\right\}     References    "  Category:Continuous distributions  Category:Normal distribution  Category:Probability distributions with non-finite variance  Category:Probability distributions     ↩  ↩   ↩
