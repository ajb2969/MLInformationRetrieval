   Resilience (materials science)      Resilience (materials science)   In material science , resilience is the ability of a material to absorb energy when it is deformed  elastically , and release that energy upon unloading. Proof resilience is defined as the maximum energy that can be absorbed within the elastic limit, without creating a permanent distortion. The modulus of resilience is defined as the maximum energy that can be absorbed per unit volume without creating a permanent distortion. It can be calculated by integrating the stress-strain curve from zero to the elastic limit. In uniaxial tension,       U  r   =    σ  y  2    2  E         subscript  U  r      superscript   subscript  σ  y   2     2  E      U_{r}=\frac{\sigma_{y}^{2}}{2E}   where U r is the modulus of resilience, σ y is the yield strength , and E is the Young's modulus . 1  Unit of resilience  Resilience ( U r ) is measured in a unit of joule per cubic metre (J·m −3 ) in the SI system, i.e. elastical deformation energy per volume of test specimen (merely for gage-length part).  Like the unit of tensile toughness ( U T ), the unit of resilience can be easily calculated by using area underneath the stress–strain ( σ – ε ) curve, which gives resilience value, as given below: 2  U r = Area underneath the stress–strain ( σ – ε ) curve = σ × ε  U r = MPa × % = (N·m −2 ·10 6 )·(m·m −1 ·10 −2 )  U r = N·m·m −3 ·10 4  U r = J·m −3 ·10 4  References  hu:Reziliencia  simple:Resilience  sr:Резилијенција "  Category:Elasticity (physics)     ↩  ↩
