   Neopentalenolactone D synthase      Neopentalenolactone D synthase   Neopentalenolactone D synthase (, ptlE (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name 1-deoxy-11-oxopentalenate,NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase (neopentalenolactone-D forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   1-deoxy-11-oxopentalenate + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    neopentalenolactone D + NADP + + H 2 O   Neopentalenolactone D synthase is a FAD-dependent oxygenase .
