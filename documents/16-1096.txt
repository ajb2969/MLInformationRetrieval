Lax functor

In category theory, a discipline within mathematics, the notion of lax functor between bicategories generalizes that of functors between categories.
Let C,D be bicategories. We denote composition in diagrammatic order. A lax functor P from C to D, denoted 
 
 
 
 , consists of the following data:

for each object x in C, an object 
 
 
 
 ;
for each pair of objects x,y ∈ C a functor on morphism-categories, 
 
 
 
 ;
for each object x∈C, a 2-morphism 
 
 
 
  in D;
for each triple of objects, x,y,z ∈C, a 2-morphism 
 
 
 
  in D that is natural in f: x→y and g: y→z.

These must satisfy three commutative diagrams, which record the interaction between left unity, right unity, and associativity between C and D. See http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pseudofunctor.
A lax functor in which all of the structure 2-morphisms, i.e. the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  above, are invertible is called a pseudofunctor.
