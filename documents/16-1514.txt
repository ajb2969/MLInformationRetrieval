   Draft:Cobordism ring      Draft:Cobordism ring   In mathematics, the oriented cobordism ring is a ring where elements are oriented cobordism classes 1 of manifolds, the multiplication is given by the Cartesian product of manifolds and the addition is given as the disjoint union of manifolds. The ring is graded by dimension of manifolds and is denoted by       Ω  *   S  O    =    ⊕  0  ∞    Ω  n   S  O          subscript   superscript  normal-Ω    S  O        superscript   subscript  direct-sum  0      subscript   superscript  normal-Ω    S  O    n      \Omega^{SO}_{*}=\oplus_{0}^{\infty}\Omega^{SO}_{n}   where    Ω  n   S  O      subscript   superscript  normal-Ω    S  O    n    \Omega^{SO}_{n}   consists of cobordism classes of manifolds of dimension n . One can also define an unoriented cobordism ring , denoted by    Ω  *  O     subscript   superscript  normal-Ω  O      \Omega^{O}_{*}   .  A theorem of Thom says:       Ω  n   =    π  n   M  O        subscript  normal-Ω  n      subscript  π  n   M  O     \Omega_{n}=\pi_{n}MO   where MO is the Thom spectrum .
