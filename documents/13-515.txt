   Hardy–Littlewood tauberian theorem      Hardy–Littlewood tauberian theorem   In mathematical analysis , the Hardy–Littlewood tauberian theorem is a tauberian theorem relating the asymptotics of the partial sums of a series with the asymptotics of its Abel summation . In this form, the theorem asserts that if, as y ↓ 0, the non-negative sequence a n is such that there is an asymptotic equivalence        ∑   n  =  0   ∞     a  n    e   -   n  y       ∼   1  y      similar-to    superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  a  n    superscript  e      n  y         1  y     \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}e^{-ny}\sim\frac{1}{y}   then there is also an asymptotic equivalence        ∑   k  =  0   n    a  k    ∼  n     similar-to    superscript   subscript     k  0    n    subscript  a  k    n    \sum_{k=0}^{n}a_{k}\sim n   as n → ∞. The integral formulation of the theorem relates in an analogous manner the asymptotics of the cumulative distribution function of a function with the asymptotics of its Laplace transform.  The theorem was proved in 1914 by G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood . 1 In 1930 Jovan Karamata gave a new and much simpler proof. 2  Statement of the theorem  Series formulation  This formulation is from Titchmarsh. 3 Suppose a n ≥ 0 for all n , and as x ↑1 we have         ∑   n  =  0   ∞     a  n    x  n     ∼   1   1  -  x     .     similar-to    superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  a  n    superscript  x  n       1    1  x      \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}x^{n}\sim\frac{1}{1-x}.   Then as n goes to ∞ we have         ∑   k  =  0   n    a  k    ∼  n   .     similar-to    superscript   subscript     k  0    n    subscript  a  k    n    \sum_{k=0}^{n}a_{k}\sim n.   The theorem is sometimes quoted in equivalent forms, where instead of requiring a n ≥ 0, we require a n = O(1), or we require a n ≥ − K for some constant K . 4 The theorem is sometimes quoted in another equivalent formulation (through the change of variable x = 1/ e y ). 5 If, as y ↓ 0,        ∑   n  =  0   ∞     a  n    e   -   n  y       ∼   1  y      similar-to    superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  a  n    superscript  e      n  y         1  y     \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}e^{-ny}\sim\frac{1}{y}   then         ∑   k  =  0   n    a  k    ∼  n   .     similar-to    superscript   subscript     k  0    n    subscript  a  k    n    \sum_{k=0}^{n}a_{k}\sim n.     Integral formulation  The following more general formulation is from Feller. 6 Consider a real-valued function F : [0,∞) → R of bounded variation . 7 The Laplace–Stieltjes transform of F is defined by the Stieltjes integral        ω   (  s  )    =    ∫  0  ∞      e   -   s  t      d  F   (  t  )      .        ω  s     superscript   subscript   0        superscript  e      s  t     d  F  t      \omega(s)=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-st}\,dF(t).     The theorem relates the asymptotics of ω with those of F in the following way. If ρ is a non-negative real number, then the following are equivalent        ω   (  s  )    ∼   C   s   -  ρ      ,     as   s   →  0      formulae-sequence   similar-to    ω  s     C   superscript  s    ρ       normal-→    as  normal-s   0     \omega(s)\sim Cs^{-\rho},\quad\rm{as\ }s\to 0            F   (  t  )    ∼    C   Γ   (   ρ  +  1   )      t  ρ     ,     as   t   →  ∞    .     formulae-sequence   similar-to    F  t       C    normal-Γ    ρ  1      superscript  t  ρ      normal-→    as  normal-t       F(t)\sim\frac{C}{\Gamma(\rho+1)}t^{\rho},\quad\rm{as\ }t\to\infty.   Here Γ denotes the Gamma function . One obtains the theorem for series as a special case by taking ρ = 1 and F ( t ) to be a piecewise constant function with value     ∑   k  =  0   n    a  k       superscript   subscript     k  0    n    subscript  a  k     \textstyle{\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_{k}}   between t = n and t = n +1.  A slight improvement is possible. A function L ( x ) is slowly varying at infinity if         L   (   t  x   )     L   (  x  )     →  1   ,   x  →  ∞      formulae-sequence   normal-→      L    t  x      L  x    1    normal-→  x      \frac{L(tx)}{L(x)}\to 1,\quad x\to\infty   for every positive t . Let L be a function slowly varying at infinity and ρ a non-negative real number. Then the following are equivalent        ω   (  s  )    ∼    s   -  ρ    L   (   s   -  1    )     ,     as   s   →  0      formulae-sequence   similar-to    ω  s      superscript  s    ρ    L   superscript  s    1       normal-→    as  normal-s   0     \omega(s)\sim s^{-\rho}L(s^{-1}),\quad\rm{as\ }s\to 0            F   (  t  )    ∼    1   Γ   (   ρ  +  1   )      t  ρ   L   (  t  )     ,     as   t   →  ∞    .     formulae-sequence   similar-to    F  t       1    normal-Γ    ρ  1      superscript  t  ρ   L  t     normal-→    as  normal-t       F(t)\sim\frac{1}{\Gamma(\rho+1)}t^{\rho}L(t),\quad\rm{as\ }t\to\infty.     Karamata's proof  found a short proof of the theorem by considering the functions g such that        lim   x  →  1      (   1  -  x   )    ∑    a  n    x  n   g   (   x  n   )       =    ∫  0  1    g   (  t  )   d  t          subscript    normal-→  x  1        1  x        subscript  a  n    superscript  x  n   g   superscript  x  n         superscript   subscript   0   1     g  t  d  t      \lim_{x\rightarrow 1}(1-x)\sum a_{n}x^{n}g(x^{n})=\int_{0}^{1}g(t)dt   An easy calculation shows that all monomials g ( x )= x k have this property, and therefore so do all polynomials g . This can be extended to a function g with simple (step) discontinuities by approximating it by polynomials from above and below (using the Weierstrass approximation theorem and a little extra fudging) and using the fact that the coefficients a n are positive. In particular the function given by g ( t )=1/ t if 1/ e −1/ N the sum Σ a n x n g ( x n ) is a 0 +...+ a N , and the integral of g is 1, from which the Hardy–Littlewood theorem follows immediately.  Examples  Non-positive coefficients  The theorem can fail without the condition that the coefficients are non-negative. For example, the function       1     (   1  +  x   )   2    (   1  -  x   )     =        1  -  x   +   2   x  2     -   2   x  3     +   3   x  4     -   3   x  5     +  ⋯         1     superscript    1  x   2     1  x                 1  x     2   superscript  x  2       2   superscript  x  3       3   superscript  x  4       3   superscript  x  5     normal-⋯     \frac{1}{(1+x)^{2}(1-x)}=1-x+2x^{2}-2x^{3}+3x^{4}-3x^{5}+\cdots   is asymptotic to 1/4(1– x ) as x tends to 1, but the partial sums of its coefficients are 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4... and are not asymptotic to any linear function.  Littlewood's extension of Tauber's theorem  In 1911 Littlewood proved an extension of Tauber 's converse of Abel's theorem . Littlewood showed the following: If a n = O(1/ n ), and as x ↑ 1 we have        ∑    a  n    x  n     →  s   ,     normal-→       subscript  a  n    superscript  x  n     s    \sum a_{n}x^{n}\to s,   then        ∑   a  n    =  s   .         subscript  a  n    s    \sum a_{n}=s.   This came historically before the Hardy–Littlewood tauberian theorem, but can be proved as a simple application of it. 8  Prime number theorem  In 1915 Hardy and Littlewood developed a proof of the prime number theorem based on their tauberian theorem; they proved         ∑   n  =  2   ∞    Λ   (  n  )    e   -   n  y       ∼   1  y    ,     similar-to    superscript   subscript     n  2        normal-Λ  n   superscript  e      n  y         1  y     \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\Lambda(n)e^{-ny}\sim\frac{1}{y},   where Λ is the von Mangoldt function , and then conclude         ∑   n  ≤  x     Λ   (  n  )     ∼  x   ,     similar-to    subscript     n  x      normal-Λ  n    x    \sum_{n\leq x}\Lambda(n)\sim x,   an equivalent form of the prime number theorem. 9 10 Littlewood developed a simpler proof, still based on this tauberian theorem, in 1971. 11  Notes  External links      "  Category:Tauberian theorems     ↩    ↩   ↩  Bounded variation is only required locally: on every bounded subinterval of [0,∞).
