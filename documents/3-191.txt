   Square root of 2      Square root of 2    "Pythagoras's constant" redirects here; not to be confused with Pythagoras number    (Figure)  The square root of 2 is equal to the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 1.   The square root of 2 , often known as root 2 , radical (rad) 2 , or Pythagoras' constant , and written as    2      2    \sqrt{2}   , is the positive algebraic number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the number 2 . Technically, it is called the principal square root of 2 , to distinguish it from the negative number with the same property.  Geometrically the square root of 2 is the length of a diagonal across a square with sides of one unit of length ; this follows from the Pythagorean theorem . It was probably the first number known to be irrational . Its numerical value, truncated to 65 decimal places , is:    .    (Figure)  right| 200px| The square root of 2 (number line not to scale).   The approximation 99/70 (≈ 1.41429) for the square root of two is frequently used.

Another early close approximation is given in ancient Indian mathematical texts, the Sulbasutras (c. 800–200 BC) as follows: Increase the length [of the side] by its third and this third by its own fourth less the thirty-fourth part of that fourth. 2 That is,         1  +   1  3   +   1   3  ⋅  4     -   1   3  ⋅  4  ⋅  34     =   577  408   =   1.41421   56862745098039  ¯     .            1    1  3     1   normal-⋅  3  4       1   normal-⋅  3  4  34       577  408          1.41421   normal-¯  56862745098039       1+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3\cdot 4}-\frac{1}{3\cdot 4\cdot 34}=\frac{577}{408}=1.%

This ancient Indian approximation is the seventh in a sequence of increasingly accurate approximations based on the sequence of Pell numbers , that can be derived from the continued fraction expansion of    2      2    \sqrt{2}   . Despite having a smaller denominator, it is only slightly less accurate than the Babylonian approximation.  Pythagoreans discovered that the diagonal of a square is incommensurable with its side, or in modern language, that the square root of two is irrational . Little is known with certainty about the time or circumstances of this discovery, but the name of Hippasus of Metapontum is often mentioned. For a while, the Pythagoreans treated as an official secret the discovery that the square root of two is irrational, and, according to legend, Hippasus was murdered for divulging it. 3 4 5 The square root of two is occasionally called "Pythagoras' number" or "Pythagoras' Constant", for example by . 6  Computation algorithms  There are a number of algorithms for approximating    2      2    \sqrt{2}   , which in expressions as a ratio of integers or as a decimal can only be approximated. The most common algorithm for this, one used as a basis in many computers and calculators, is the Babylonian method 7 of computing square roots, which is one of many methods of computing square roots . It goes as follows:  First, pick a guess,     a  0   >  0       subscript  a  0   0    a_{0}>0   ; the value of the guess affects only how many iterations are required to reach an approximation of a certain accuracy. Then, using that guess, iterate through the following recursive computation:        a   n  +  1    =     a  n   +   2   a  n     2   =     a  n   2   +   1   a  n      .         subscript  a    n  1         subscript  a  n     2   subscript  a  n     2             subscript  a  n   2     1   subscript  a  n        a_{n+1}=\frac{a_{n}+\frac{2}{a_{n}}}{2}=\frac{a_{n}}{2}+\frac{1}{a_{n}}.     The more iterations through the algorithm (that is, the more computations performed and the greater "n"), the better approximation of the square root of 2 is achieved. Each iteration approximately doubles the number of correct digits. Starting with a 0 = 1 the next approximations are   3/2 = 1 .5  17/12 = 1.41 6...  577/408 = 1.41421 5...  665857/470832 = 1.41421356237 46....   The value of    2      2    \sqrt{2}   was calculated to 137,438,953,444 decimal places by Yasumasa Kanada 's team in 1997. In February 2006 the record for the calculation of    2      2    \sqrt{2}   was eclipsed with the use of a home computer. Shigeru Kondo calculated 200,000,000,000 decimal places in slightly over 13 days and 14 hours using a 3.6 GHz PC with 16GB of memory. 8 Among mathematical constants with computationally challenging decimal expansions, only    π   π   \pi    has been calculated more precisely. 9 Such computations aim to check empirically whether such numbers are normal .  Proofs of irrationality  A short proof of the irrationality of    2      2    \sqrt{2}   can be obtained from the rational root theorem , that is, if    p   (  x  )       p  x    p(x)   is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients, then any rational  root of    p   (  x  )       p  x    p(x)   is necessarily an integer. Applying this to the polynomial     p   (  x  )    =    x  2   -  2         p  x      superscript  x  2   2     p(x)=x^{2}-2   , it follows that    2      2    \sqrt{2}   is either an integer or irrational. Because    2      2    \sqrt{2}   is not an integer (2 is not a perfect square),    2      2    \sqrt{2}   must therefore be irrational. This proof can be generalized to show that any root of any natural number which is not the square of a natural number is irrational.  See quadratic irrational or infinite descent#Irrationality of √k if it is not an integer for a proof that the square root of any non-square natural number is irrational.  Proof by infinite descent  One proof of the number's irrationality is the following proof by infinite descent . It is also a proof by contradiction , also known as an indirect proof, in that the proposition is proved by assuming that the opposite of the proposition is true and showing that this assumption is false, thereby implying that the proposition must be true.   Assume that    2      2    \sqrt{2}   is a rational number, meaning that there exists a pair of integers whose ratio is    2      2    \sqrt{2}   .  If the two integers have a common factor, it can be eliminated using the Euclidean algorithm .  Then    2      2    \sqrt{2}   can be written as an irreducible fraction     a  /  b      a  b    a/b   such that   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   are coprime integers (having no common factor).  It follows that      a  2   /   b  2    =  2         superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2    2    a^{2}/b^{2}=2   and     a  2   =   2   b  2         superscript  a  2     2   superscript  b  2      a^{2}=2b^{2}   .   (       (   a  /  b   )   n   =    a  n   /   b  n         superscript    a  b   n      superscript  a  n    superscript  b  n      (a/b)^{n}=a^{n}/b^{n}    )  Therefore    a  2     superscript  a  2    a^{2}   is even because it is equal to    2   b  2       2   superscript  b  2     2b^{2}   . (    2   b  2       2   superscript  b  2     2b^{2}   is necessarily even because it is 2 times another whole number and multiples of 2 are even.)  It follows that   a   a   a   must be even (as squares of odd integers are never even).  Because   a   a   a   is even, there exists an integer   k   k   k   that fulfills    a  =   2  k       a    2  k     a=2k   .  Substituting    2  k      2  k    2k   from step 7 for   a   a   a   in the second equation of step 4     2   b  2    =    (   2  k   )   2         2   superscript  b  2     superscript    2  k   2     2b^{2}=(2k)^{2}   is equivalent to     2   b  2    =   4   k  2          2   superscript  b  2      4   superscript  k  2      2b^{2}=4k^{2}   , which is equivalent to     b  2   =   2   k  2         superscript  b  2     2   superscript  k  2      b^{2}=2k^{2}   .  Because    2   k  2       2   superscript  k  2     2k^{2}   is divisible by two and therefore even, and because     2   k  2    =   b  2         2   superscript  k  2     superscript  b  2     2k^{2}=b^{2}   , it follows that    b  2     superscript  b  2    b^{2}   is also even which means that   b   b   b   is even.  By steps 5 and 8   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   are both even, which contradicts that    a  /  b      a  b    a/b   is irreducible as stated in step 2.     Q.E.D.      Because there is a contradiction, the assumption (1) that    2      2    \sqrt{2}   is a rational number must be false. This means that    2      2    \sqrt{2}   is not a rational number; i.e.,    2      2    \sqrt{2}   is irrational.  This proof was hinted at by Aristotle , in his Analytica Priora , §I.23. 10 It appeared first as a full proof in Euclid's  Elements , as proposition 117 of Book X. However, since the early 19th century historians have agreed that this proof is an interpolation and not attributable to Euclid. 11  Proof by unique factorization  An alternative proof uses the same approach with the fundamental theorem of arithmetic which says every integer greater than 1 has a unique factorization into powers of primes.   Assume that    2      2    \sqrt{2}   is a rational number. Then there are integers a and b such that a is coprime to b and     2   =   a  /  b         2     a  b     \sqrt{2}=a/b   . In other words,    2      2    \sqrt{2}   can be written as an irreducible fraction .  The value of b cannot be 1 as there is no integer a the square of which is 2.  There must be a prime p which divides b and which does not divide a , otherwise the fraction would not be irreducible.  The square of a can be factored as the product of the primes into which a is factored but with each power doubled.  Therefore by unique factorization the prime p which divides b , and also its square, cannot divide the square of a .  Therefore the square of an irreducible fraction cannot be reduced to an integer.  Therefore the square root of 2 cannot be a rational number.   This proof can be generalized to show that if an integer is not an exact kth power of another integer then its kth root is irrational. For a proof of the same result which does not rely on the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, see: quadratic irrational .  Proof by infinite descent, not involving factoring  The following reductio ad absurdum argument showing the irrationality of    2      2    \sqrt{2}   is less well-known. It uses the additional information    2  >   2   >  1        2    2        1     2>\sqrt{2}>1   so that    1  >    2   -  1   >  0        1      2   1        0     1>\sqrt{2}-1>0   . 12   Assume that    2      2    \sqrt{2}   is a rational number. This would mean that there exist positive integers m and n with    n  ≠  0      n  0    n\neq 0   such that     m  /  n   =   2         m  n     2     m/n=\sqrt{2}   . Then    m  =   n   2        m    n    2      m=n\sqrt{2}   and     m   2    =   2  n         m    2      2  n     m\sqrt{2}=2n   .  We may assume that n is the smallest integer so that    n   2       n    2     n\sqrt{2}   is an integer. That is, that the fraction m / n is in lowest terms.  Then     2   =   m  n   =    m   (    2   -  1   )     n   (    2   -  1   )     =     2  n   -  m    m  -  n            2     m  n            m      2   1      n      2   1                2  n   m     m  n       \sqrt{2}=\frac{m}{n}=\frac{m(\sqrt{2}-1)}{n(\sqrt{2}-1)}=\frac{2n-m}{m-n}     Because    1  >    2   -  1   >  0        1      2   1        0     1>\sqrt{2}-1>0   , it follows that    n  >   n   (    2   -  1   )    =   m  -  n   >  0        n    n      2   1           m  n        0     n>n(\sqrt{2}-1)=m-n>0   .  So the fraction m / n for    2      2    \sqrt{2}   , which according to (2) is already in lowest terms , is represented by (3) in strictly lower terms. This is a contradiction, so the assumption that    2      2    \sqrt{2}   is rational must be false.   Geometric proof  Another reductio ad absurdum showing that    2      2    \sqrt{2}   is irrational is less well-known. 13 It is also an example of proof by infinite descent . It makes use of classic compass and straightedge construction, proving the theorem by a method similar to that employed by ancient Greek geometers. It is essentially the previous proof viewed geometrically.  Let ABC be a right isosceles triangle with hypotenuse length m and legs n . By the Pythagorean theorem ,     m  /  n   =   2         m  n     2     m/n=\sqrt{2}   . Suppose m and n are integers . Let m : n be a ratio given in its lowest terms .  Draw the arcs BD and CE with centre A . Join DE . It follows that AB = AD , AC = AE and the ∠ BAC and ∠ DAE coincide. Therefore the triangles ABC and ADE are congruent by SAS .  Because ∠ EBF is a right angle and ∠ BEF is half a right angle, BEF is also a right isosceles triangle. Hence BE = m − n implies BF = m − n . By symmetry, DF = m − n , and FDC is also a right isosceles triangle. It also follows that FC = n − ( m − n ) = 2 n − m .  Hence we have an even smaller right isosceles triangle, with hypotenuse length 2 n − m and legs m − n . These values are integers even smaller than m and n and in the same ratio, contradicting the hypothesis that m : n is in lowest terms. Therefore m and n cannot be both integers, hence    2      2    \sqrt{2}   is irrational.  Pythagorean Theorem Proof  Suppose    2      2    \sqrt{2}   is rational.  That means that we can make a right isosceles triangle where the side lengths are natural numbers and the legs and the hypotenuse do not share any common factors (except 1). {1}  Since the legs are equal, so are their squares. So in order for the Pythagorean Theorem to work for this special right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse has to be an even number (and if we cut it in half once then we have the area of the square of the leg).  Recall that the square of an even number is even and the square of an odd number is odd. So if the square of the hypotenuse is even the hypotenuse is even as well. {2}  Remember that a square is a quadrilateral with 2 pairs of parallel sides which are equal in length and has 4 right angles. So both sides of the square of the hypotenuse are even.  So the square of the hypotenuse of this right triangle can be cut in half twice and still have integer area. Since we only want to cut it in half once, then we'll get an even number.  So the square of the leg is even. Now according to {2} the leg must be even  This contradicts our assumption at {1} that the leg and hypotenuse have no common factors (except 1). Because if they're both even they share a common factor of 2. So the assumption that    2      2    \sqrt{2}   was rational has to be false. Or in other words    2      2    \sqrt{2}   is an irrational number. Q. E. D.

For    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   ,      0  <   |     2    q  1    -   p  1    |   <   1  2         0          2    subscript  q  1     subscript  p  1            1  2      0<\left|\sqrt{2}q_{1}-p_{1}\right|<\frac{1}{2}     and if is true for n then is true for    n  +  1      n  1    n+1   .

By application of the lemma,    2      2    \sqrt{2}   is irrational.  Constructive proof  In a constructive approach, one distinguishes between on the one hand not being rational, and on the other hand being irrational (i.e., being quantifiably apart from every rational), the latter being a stronger property. Given positive integers a and b , because the valuation (i.e., highest power of 2 dividing a number) of 2 b 2 is odd, while the valuation of a 2 is even, they must be distinct integers; thus     |    2   b  2    -   a  2    |   ≥  1            2   superscript  b  2     superscript  a  2     1    |2b^{2}-a^{2}|\geq 1   . Then 14        |    2   -   a  b    |   =    |    2   b  2    -   a  2    |     b  2    (    2   +   a  /  b    )     ≥   1    b  2    (    2   +   a  /  b    )     ≥   1   3   b  2      ,              2     a  b             2   superscript  b  2     superscript  a  2        superscript  b  2       2     a  b             1     superscript  b  2       2     a  b             1    3   superscript  b  2        \left|\sqrt{2}-\frac{a}{b}\right|=\frac{|2b^{2}-a^{2}|}{b^{2}(\sqrt{2}+a/b)}%
 \geq\frac{1}{b^{2}(\sqrt{2}+a/b)}\geq\frac{1}{3b^{2}},     the latter inequality being true because we assume     a  b   ≤   3  -   2          a  b     3    2      \tfrac{a}{b}\leq 3-\sqrt{2}   (otherwise the quantitative apartness can be trivially established). This gives a lower bound of    1   3   b  2        1    3   superscript  b  2      \frac{1}{3b^{2}}   for the difference    |    2   -   a  /  b    |          2     a  b      |\sqrt{2}-a/b|   , yielding a direct proof of irrationality not relying on the law of excluded middle ; see Errett Bishop (1985, p. 18). This proof constructively exhibits a discrepancy between    2      2    \sqrt{2}   and any rational.  Properties of the square root of two  (Figure)  Angle size and sector area are the same when the conic radius is square root of two. This diagram illustrates the circular and hyperbolic functions based on sector areas u .   One-half of    2      2    \sqrt{2}   , also 1 divided by the square root of 2, approximately 0.70710 67811 86548, is a common quantity in geometry and trigonometry because the unit vector that makes a 45° angle with the axes in a plane has the coordinates       (    2   2   ,    2   2   )   .         2   2       2   2     \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right).     This number satisfies          1  2     2    =     1  2     =   1   2    =   cos   (   45  ∘   )    =   sin   (   45  ∘   )     .            1  2     2        1  2           1    2            superscript  45             superscript  45        \tfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{2}=\sqrt{\tfrac{1}{2}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=\cos(45^{\circ})=%
 \sin(45^{\circ}).     One interesting property of the square root of 2 is as follows:        1    2   -  1     =    2   +  1         1      2   1        2   1     \!\ {1\over{\sqrt{2}-1}}=\sqrt{2}+1     since      (    2   +  1   )    (    2   -  1   )    =   2  -  1   =  1.              2   1       2   1      2  1        1.     (\sqrt{2}+1)(\sqrt{2}-1)=2-1=1.   This is related to the property of silver ratios .  The square root of 2 can also be expressed in terms of the copies of the imaginary unit  i using only the square root and arithmetic operations :         i   +   i   i     i   and      -  i    -   i    -  i       -  i              i     i    i     i   and          i      i      i        i      \frac{\sqrt{i}+i\sqrt{i}}{i}\text{ and }\frac{\sqrt{-i}-i\sqrt{-i}}{-i}     if the square root symbol is interpreted suitably for the complex numbers i and - i .  The square root of 2 is also the only real number other than 1 whose infinite tetrate (i.e., infinite exponential tower) is equal to its square. In other words: If for c > 1 we define x 1 = c and x n+1 = c x n for n > 1, we will call the limit of x n as n → ∞, if this limit exists, by the name f(c). Then sqrt(2) is the only number c > 1 for which f(c) = c 2 . Or symbolically:        2    (    2    (    2    (   ⋅      ⋅  ⋅   )   )   )          =  2.       superscript    2    fragments  normal-(   superscript    2    fragments  normal-(   superscript    2    fragments  normal-(   superscript  normal-⋅   fragments   fragments   fragments   superscript  normal-⋅  normal-⋅   normal-)   normal-)   normal-)          2.    \sqrt{2}^{(\sqrt{2}^{(\sqrt{2}^{(\ \cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot})))}}}}=2.     The square root of 2 appears in Viète's formula for π :        2  m     2  -    2  +    2  +  ⋯  +   2          →   π  as  m   →   ∞        normal-→     superscript  2  m       2      2      2  normal-⋯    2            π  as  m     normal-→        2^{m}\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\cdots+\sqrt{2}}}}\to\pi\text{ as }m\to\infty\,     for m square roots and only one minus sign. 15  Similar in appearance but with a finite number of terms, the square root of 2 appears in various trigonometric constants: 16        sin   (    5    5  8     ∘   )    =    1  2     2  -    2  +    2  +   2           ;         superscript    5    5  8           1  2       2      2      2    2            \sin(5\tfrac{5}{8}^{\circ})=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}}};           sin   (    11    1  4     ∘   )    =    1  2     2  -    2  +   2         ;         superscript    11    1  4           1  2       2      2    2          \sin(11\tfrac{1}{4}^{\circ})=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}};           sin   (    16    7  8     ∘   )    =    1  2     2  -    2  +    2  -   2           ;         superscript    16    7  8           1  2       2      2      2    2            \sin(16\tfrac{7}{8}^{\circ})=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}}}};           sin   (    22    1  2     ∘   )    =    1  2     2  -   2       ;         superscript    22    1  2           1  2       2    2        \sin(22\tfrac{1}{2}^{\circ})=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}};           sin   (    28    1  8     ∘   )    =    1  2     2  -    2  -    2  -   2           ;         superscript    28    1  8           1  2       2      2      2    2            \sin(28\tfrac{1}{8}^{\circ})=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}}}};           sin   (    33    3  4     ∘   )    =    1  2     2  -    2  -   2         ;         superscript    33    3  4           1  2       2      2    2          \sin(33\tfrac{3}{4}^{\circ})=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}}};           sin   (    39    3  8     ∘   )    =    1  2     2  -    2  -    2  +   2           ;         superscript    39    3  8           1  2       2      2      2    2            \sin(39\tfrac{3}{8}^{\circ})=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}}};           sin   (   45  ∘   )    =    1  2    2     ;         superscript  45         1  2     2      \sin(45^{\circ})=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2};           sin   (    50    5  8     ∘   )    =    1  2     2  +    2  -    2  +   2           ;         superscript    50    5  8           1  2       2      2      2    2            \sin(50\tfrac{5}{8}^{\circ})=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}}};           sin   (    56    1  4     ∘   )    =    1  2     2  +    2  -   2         ;         superscript    56    1  4           1  2       2      2    2          \sin(56\tfrac{1}{4}^{\circ})=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}}};           sin   (    61    7  8     ∘   )    =    1  2     2  +    2  -    2  -   2           ;         superscript    61    7  8           1  2       2      2      2    2            \sin(61\tfrac{7}{8}^{\circ})=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}}}};           sin   (    67    1  2     ∘   )    =    1  2     2  +   2       ;         superscript    67    1  2           1  2       2    2        \sin(67\tfrac{1}{2}^{\circ})=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}};           sin   (    73    1  8     ∘   )    =    1  2     2  +    2  +    2  -   2           ;         superscript    73    1  8           1  2       2      2      2    2            \sin(73\tfrac{1}{8}^{\circ})=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}}}};           sin   (    78    3  4     ∘   )    =    1  2     2  +    2  +   2         ;         superscript    78    3  4           1  2       2      2    2          \sin(78\tfrac{3}{4}^{\circ})=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}};           sin   (    84    3  8     ∘   )    =    1  2     2  +    2  +    2  +   2           .         superscript    84    3  8           1  2       2      2      2    2            \sin(84\tfrac{3}{8}^{\circ})=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}}}.

For example, the series for    cos   (   π  /  4   )         π  4     \cos(\pi/4)   gives        1   2    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞       (   -  1   )   k     (   π  4   )    2  k       (   2  k   )   !      .        1    2      superscript   subscript     k  0           superscript    1   k    superscript    π  4     2  k         2  k        \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k}\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)%

BBP-type formulas are known for    π   2       π    2     \pi\sqrt{2}   and     2    ln   (   1  +   2    )          2       1    2       \sqrt{2}\ln(1+\sqrt{2})   , however. 18  Continued fraction representation  The square root of two has the following continued fraction representation:         2    =   1  +   1   2  +    1   2  +    1   2  +    1   2  +  ⋱               .        2     1   continued-fraction  1    2   continued-fraction  1    2   continued-fraction  1    2   continued-fraction  1    2  normal-⋱             \!\ \sqrt{2}=1+\cfrac{1}{2+\cfrac{1}{2+\cfrac{1}{2+\cfrac{1}{2+\ddots}}}}.     The convergents formed by truncating this representation form a sequence of fractions that approximate the square root of two to increasing accuracy, and that are described by the Pell numbers (known as side and diameter numbers to the ancient Greeks because of their use in approximating the ratio between the sides and diagonal of a square). The first convergents are: 1/1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, 99/70, 239/169, 577/408. The convergent p/q differs from the square root of 2 by almost exactly     1   2   q  2    2         1    2   superscript  q  2     2      \scriptstyle{\frac{1}{2q^{2}\sqrt{2}}}   and then the next convergent is ( p + 2 q )/( p + q ).  Derived constants  The reciprocal of the square root of two (the square root of 1/2) is a widely used constant.       1  /   2    =    2   /  2   =   sin   45  ∘    =   cos   45  ∘    =  0.70710678118654752440084436210484903928...          1    2        2   2           superscript  45             superscript  45          0.70710678118654752440084436210484903928...     1/\sqrt{2}=\sqrt{2}/2=\sin 45^{\circ}=\cos 45^{\circ}=0.7071067811865475244008%

This ratio guarantees that cutting a sheet in half along a line parallel to its short side results in the smaller sheets having the same ratio as the original sheet.

The square root of two forms the relationship of f-stops in photographic lenses, which in turn means that the ratio of areas between two successive apertures is 2.
