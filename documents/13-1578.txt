   P-adic Hodge theory      P-adic Hodge theory   In mathematics , p -adic Hodge theory is a theory that provides a way to classify and study p -adic Galois representations of characteristic 0  local fields 1 with residual characteristic p (such as Q p ). The theory has its beginnings in Jean-Pierre Serre and John Tate 's study of Tate modules of abelian varieties and the notion of Hodge–Tate representation . Hodge–Tate representations are related to certain decompositions of p -adic cohomology theories analogous to the Hodge decomposition , hence the name p -adic Hodge theory. Further developments were inspired by properties of p -adic Galois representations arising from the étale cohomology of varieties . Jean-Marc Fontaine introduced many of the basic concepts of the field.  General classification of p -adic representations  Let K be a local field of residue field k of characteristic p . In this article, a p-adic representation of K (or of G K , the absolute Galois group of K ) will be a continuous representation ρ : G K → GL( V ) where V is a finite-dimensional vector space over Q p . The collection of all p -adic representations of K form an abelian category denoted     Rep   𝐐  p     (  K  )        subscript  Rep   subscript  𝐐  p    K    \mathrm{Rep}_{\mathbf{Q}_{p}}(K)   in this article. p -adic Hodge theory provides subcollections of p -adic representations based on how nice they are, and also provides faithful functors to categories of linear algebraic objects that are easier to study. The basic classification is as follows: 2        Rep   c  r  i  s     (  K  )    ⊊    Rep   s  t     (  K  )    ⊊    Rep   d  R     (  K  )    ⊊    Rep   H  T     (  K  )    ⊊    Rep   𝐐  p     (  K  )             subscript  Rep    c  r  i  s    K      subscript  Rep    s  t    K           subscript  Rep    d  R    K           subscript  Rep    H  T    K           subscript  Rep   subscript  𝐐  p    K      \mathrm{Rep}_{cris}(K)\subsetneq\mathrm{Rep}_{st}(K)\subsetneq\mathrm{Rep}_{dR%
 }(K)\subsetneq\mathrm{Rep}_{HT}(K)\subsetneq\mathrm{Rep}_{\mathbf{Q}_{p}}(K)   where each collection is a full subcategory properly contained in the next. In order, these are the categories of crystalline representations , semistable representations , de Rham representations , Hodge–Tate representations, and all p -adic representations. In addition, two other categories of representations can be introduced, the potentially crystalline representations Rep pcris ( K ) and the potentially semistable representations Rep pst ( K ). The latter strictly contains the former which in turn generally strictly contains Rep cris ( K ); additionally, Rep pst ( K ) generally strictly contains Rep st ( K ), and is contained in Rep dR ( K ) (with equality when the residue field of K is finite, a statement called the p -adic monodromy theorem ).  Period rings and comparison isomorphisms in arithmetic geometry  The general strategy of p -adic Hodge theory, introduced by Fontaine, is to construct certain so-called period rings 3 such as B dR , B st , B cris , and B HT which have both an action by G K and some linear algebraic structure and to consider so-called Dieudonné modules        D  B    (  V  )    =    (   B   ⊗   𝐐  p    V   )    G  K           subscript  D  B   V    superscript    subscript  tensor-product   subscript  𝐐  p    B  V    subscript  G  K      D_{B}(V)=(B\otimes_{\mathbf{Q}_{p}}V)^{G_{K}}   (where B is a period ring, and V is a p -adic representation) which no longer have a G K -action, but are endowed with linear algebraic structures inherited from the ring B . In particular, they are vector spaces over the fixed field    E  :=   B   G  K       assign  E   superscript  B   subscript  G  K      E:=B^{G_{K}}   . 4 This construction fits into the formalism of B -admissible representations introduced by Fontaine. For a period ring like the aforementioned ones B ∗ (for ∗ = HT, dR, st, cris), the category of p -adic representations Rep ∗ ( K ) mentioned above is the category of B ∗ -admissible ones, i.e. those p -adic representations V for which        dim  E     D   B  ∗     (  V  )     =    dim   𝐐  p    V         subscript  dimension  E      subscript  D   subscript  B  normal-∗    V      subscript  dimension   subscript  𝐐  p    V     \dim_{E}D_{B_{\ast}}(V)=\dim_{\mathbf{Q}_{p}}V   or, equivalently, the comparison morphism       α  V   :      B  ∗    ⊗  E    D   B  ∗      (  V  )    ⟶    B  ∗    ⊗   𝐐  p    V       normal-:   subscript  α  V    normal-⟶      subscript  tensor-product  E    subscript  B  normal-∗    subscript  D   subscript  B  normal-∗     V     subscript  tensor-product   subscript  𝐐  p     subscript  B  normal-∗   V      \alpha_{V}:B_{\ast}\otimes_{E}D_{B_{\ast}}(V)\longrightarrow B_{\ast}\otimes_{%
 \mathbf{Q}_{p}}V   is an isomorphism .  This formalism (and the name period ring) grew out of a few results and conjectures regarding comparison isomorphisms in arithmetic and complex geometry :   If X is a proper  smooth  scheme over C , there is a classical comparison isomorphism between the algebraic de Rham cohomology of X over C and the singular cohomology of X ( C )            H  dR  ∗    (   X  /  𝐂   )    ≅     H  ∗    (   X   (  𝐂  )    ,  𝐐  )     ⊗  𝐐   𝐂    .         subscript   superscript  H  normal-∗   dR     X  𝐂      subscript  tensor-product  𝐐      superscript  H  normal-∗      X  𝐂   𝐐    𝐂     H^{\ast}_{\mathrm{dR}}(X/\mathbf{C})\cong H^{\ast}(X(\mathbf{C}),\mathbf{Q})%
 \otimes_{\mathbf{Q}}\mathbf{C}.       This isomorphism can be obtained by considering a pairing obtained by integrating  differential forms in the algebraic de Rham cohomology over cycles in the singular cohomology. The result of such an integration is called a period and is generally a complex number. This explains why the singular cohomology must be tensored to C , and from this point of view, C can be said to contain all the periods necessary to compare algebraic de Rham cohomology with singular cohomology, and could hence be called a period ring in this situation.    In the mid sixties, Tate conjectured 5 that a similar isomorphism should hold for proper smooth schemes X over K between algebraic de Rham cohomology and p -adic étale cohomology (the Hodge–Tate conjecture , also called C HT ). Specifically, let C K be the completion of an algebraic closure of K , let C K ( i ) denote C K where the action of G K is via g · z = χ( g ) i g· z (where χ is the p -adic cyclotomic character , and i is an integer), and let     B  HT   :=    ⊕   i  ∈  𝐙      𝐂  K    (  i  )        assign   subscript  B  HT     subscript  direct-sum    i  𝐙       subscript  𝐂  K   i      B_{\mathrm{HT}}:=\oplus_{i\in\mathbf{Z}}\mathbf{C}_{K}(i)   . Then there is a functorial isomorphism            B  HT    ⊗  K   gr    H  dR  ∗    (   X  /  K   )    ≅     B  HT    ⊗   𝐐  p     H    e  ´   t   ∗     (   X   ×  K    K  ¯    ,   𝐐  p   )            subscript  tensor-product  K    subscript  B  HT   gr    subscript   superscript  H  normal-∗   dR     X  K        subscript  tensor-product   subscript  𝐐  p     subscript  B  HT    subscript   superscript  H  normal-∗      normal-´  normal-e   normal-t        subscript   K   X   normal-¯  K     subscript  𝐐  p       B_{\mathrm{HT}}\otimes_{K}\mathrm{gr}H^{\ast}_{\mathrm{dR}}(X/K)\cong B_{%

 \overline{K},\mathbf{Q}_{p})       of graded vector spaces with G K -action (the de Rham cohomology is equipped with the Hodge filtration , and    gr   H  dR  ∗       gr   subscript   superscript  H  normal-∗   dR     \mathrm{gr}H^{\ast}_{\mathrm{dR}}   is its associated graded). This conjecture was proved by Gerd Faltings in the late eighties 6 after partial results by several other mathematicians (including Tate himself).    For an abelian variety X with good reduction over a p -adic field K , Alexander Grothendieck reformulated a theorem of Tate's to say that the crystalline cohomology  H 1 ( X / W ( k )) ⊗ Q p of the special fiber (with the Frobenius endomorphism on this group and the Hodge filtration on this group tensored with K ) and the p -adic étale cohomology H 1 ( X , Q p ) (with the action of the Galois group of K ) contained the same information. Both are equivalent to the p -divisible group associated to X , up to isogeny. Grothendieck conjectured that there should be a way to go directly from p -adic étale cohomology to crystalline cohomology (and back), for all varieties with good reduction over p -adic fields. 7 This suggested relation became known as the mysterious functor .   To improve the Hodge–Tate conjecture to one involving the de Rham cohomology (not just its associated graded), Fontaine constructed 8 a filtered ring B dR whose associated graded is B HT and conjectured 9 the following (called C dR ) for any smooth proper scheme X over K         B  dR    ⊗  K    H  dR  ∗     (   X  /  K   )    ≅     B  dR    ⊗   𝐐  p     H    e  ´   t   ∗     (   X   ×  K    K  ¯    ,   𝐐  p   )            subscript  tensor-product  K    subscript  B  dR    subscript   superscript  H  normal-∗   dR      X  K        subscript  tensor-product   subscript  𝐐  p     subscript  B  dR    subscript   superscript  H  normal-∗      normal-´  normal-e   normal-t        subscript   K   X   normal-¯  K     subscript  𝐐  p       B_{\mathrm{dR}}\otimes_{K}H^{\ast}_{\mathrm{dR}}(X/K)\cong B_{\mathrm{dR}}%

 ,\mathbf{Q}_{p})   as filtered vector spaces with G K -action. In this way, B dR could be said to contain all ( p -adic) periods required to compare algebraic de Rham cohomology with p -adic étale cohomology, just as the complex numbers above were used with the comparison with singular cohomology. This is where B dR obtains its name of ring of p-adic periods .  Similarly, to formulate a conjecture explaining Grothendieck's mysterious functor, Fontaine introduced a ring B cris with G K -action, a "Frobenius" φ, and a filtration after extending scalars from K 0 to K . He conjectured 10 the following (called C cris ) for any smooth proper scheme X over K with good reduction         B  cris    ⊗   K  0     H  dR  ∗     (   X  /  K   )    ≅     B  cris    ⊗   𝐐  p     H    e  ´   t   ∗     (   X   ×  K    K  ¯    ,   𝐐  p   )            subscript  tensor-product   subscript  K  0     subscript  B  cris    subscript   superscript  H  normal-∗   dR      X  K        subscript  tensor-product   subscript  𝐐  p     subscript  B  cris    subscript   superscript  H  normal-∗      normal-´  normal-e   normal-t        subscript   K   X   normal-¯  K     subscript  𝐐  p       B_{\mathrm{cris}}\otimes_{K_{0}}H^{\ast}_{\mathrm{dR}}(X/K)\cong B_{\mathrm{%

 \overline{K},\mathbf{Q}_{p})   as vector spaces with φ-action, G K -action, and filtration after extending scalars to K (here     H  dR  ∗    (   X  /  K   )        subscript   superscript  H  normal-∗   dR     X  K     H^{\ast}_{\mathrm{dR}}(X/K)   is given its structure as a K 0 -vector space with φ-action given by its comparison with crystalline cohomology). Both the C dR and the C cris conjectures were proved by Faltings. 11  Upon comparing these two conjectures with the notion of B ∗ -admissible representations above, it is seen that if X is a proper smooth scheme over K (with good reduction) and V is the p -adic Galois representation obtained as is its i th p -adic étale cohomology group, then         D   B  ∗     (  V  )    =    H  dR  i    (   X  /  K   )     .         subscript  D   subscript  B  normal-∗    V      subscript   superscript  H  i   dR     X  K      D_{B_{\ast}}(V)=H^{i}_{\mathrm{dR}}(X/K).   In other words, the Dieudonné modules should be thought of as giving the other cohomologies related to V .  In the late eighties, Fontaine and Uwe Jannsen formulated another comparison isomorphism conjecture, C st , this time allowing X to have semi-stable reduction . Fontaine constructed 12 a ring B st with G K -action, a "Frobenius" φ, a filtration after extending scalars from K 0 to K (and fixing an extension of the p -adic logarithm ), and a "monodromy operator" N . When X has semi-stable reduction, the de Rham cohomology can be equipped with the φ-action and a monodromy operator by its comparison with the log-crystalline cohomology first introduced by Osamu Hyodo. 13 The conjecture then states that         B  st    ⊗   K  0     H  dR  ∗     (   X  /  K   )    ≅     B  st    ⊗   𝐐  p     H    e  ´   t   ∗     (   X   ×  K    K  ¯    ,   𝐐  p   )            subscript  tensor-product   subscript  K  0     subscript  B  st    subscript   superscript  H  normal-∗   dR      X  K        subscript  tensor-product   subscript  𝐐  p     subscript  B  st    subscript   superscript  H  normal-∗      normal-´  normal-e   normal-t        subscript   K   X   normal-¯  K     subscript  𝐐  p       B_{\mathrm{st}}\otimes_{K_{0}}H^{\ast}_{\mathrm{dR}}(X/K)\cong B_{\mathrm{st}}%
