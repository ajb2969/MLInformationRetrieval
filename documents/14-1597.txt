   Kummer's theorem      Kummer's theorem   In mathematics , Kummer's theorem on binomial coeffients gives the highest power of a prime number  p dividing a binomial coefficient . In particular, it asserts that given integers  n ≥ m ≥ 0 and a prime number p , the maximum integer k such that p k divides the binomial coefficient    (      n      m      )     binomial  n  m    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{m}}\right)}   is equal to the number of carries when m is added to n − m in base  p .  The theorem is named after Ernst Kummer , who proved it in the paper . It can be proved by writing    (      n      m      )     binomial  n  m    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{m}}\right)}   as     n  !     m  !     (   n  -  m   )   !          n       m       n  m       \tfrac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}   and using Legendre's formula .
