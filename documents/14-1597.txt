Kummer's theorem

In mathematics, Kummer's theorem on binomial coeffients gives the highest power of a prime number p dividing a binomial coefficient. In particular, it asserts that given integers n ≥ m ≥ 0 and a prime number p, the maximum integer k such that pk divides the binomial coefficient 
 
 
 
  is equal to the number of carries when m is added to n − m in base p.
The theorem is named after Ernst Kummer, who proved it in the paper . It can be proved by writing 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
  and using Legendre's formula.
