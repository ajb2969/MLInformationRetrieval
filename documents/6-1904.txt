   Grammar-based code      Grammar-based code   Grammar-based codes or Grammar-based compression are compression algorithms based on the idea of constructing a context-free grammar (CFG) for the string to be compressed. Examples include universal lossless data compression algorithms 1 and SEQUITUR , among others. To compress a data sequence    x  =    x  1   ⋯   x  n        x     subscript  x  1   normal-⋯   subscript  x  n      x=x_{1}\cdots x_{n}   , a grammar-based code transforms   x   x   x   into a context-free grammar   G   G   G   . The problem to find a smallest grammar for an input sequence is known to be NP-hard, 2 so many grammar-transform algorithms are proposed from theoretical and practical viewpoints. Generally, the produced grammar   G   G   G   is further compressed by statistical encoders like arithmetic coding .  Examples and characteristics  The class of grammar-based codes is very broad. It includes block codes, variations of the incremental parsing Lempel-Ziv code , 3 the multilevel pattern matching (MPM) algorithm, 4 and many other new universal lossless compression algorithms. Grammar-based codes are universal in the sense that they can achieve asymptotically the entropy rate of any stationary, ergodic source with a finite alphabet.  Practical algorithms  The compression programs of following are available from external links.   Sequitur 5 is a classical grammar compression algorithm that sequentially translates an input text into a CFG, and then the produced CFG is encoded by an arithmetic coder.  Re-Pair 6 is a greedy algorithm by the strategy of most-frequent-first substitution. The compressive performance is powerful, although the main memory space is very large.
