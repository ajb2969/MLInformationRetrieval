   Profitability index      Profitability index   Profitability index ( PI ), also known as profit investment ratio ( PIR ) and value investment ratio ( VIR ), is the ratio of payoff to investment of a proposed project. It is a useful tool for ranking projects because it allows you to quantify the amount of value created per unit of investment.  The ratio is calculated as follows:       Profitability index  =   PV of future cash flows  Initial investment       Profitability index    PV of future cash flows  Initial investment     \text{Profitability index}=\frac{\text{PV of future cash flows}}{\text{Initial%
  investment}}      Assuming that the cash flow calculated does not include the investment made in the project, a profitability index of 1 indicates breakeven. Any value lower than one would indicate that the project's PV is less than the initial investment. As the value of the profitability index increases, so does the financial attractiveness of the proposed project.  Rules for selection or rejection of a project:   If PI > 1 then accept the project  If PI < 1 then reject the project   For example:   Investment = $40,000  Life of the Machine = 5 Years   CFAT Year      CFAT   1        18000  2        12000  3        10000  4         9000  5         6000  Calculate Net present value at 10% and PI:  Year      CFAT      PV@10%       PV   1        18000      0.909      16362  2        12000      0.827       9924  3        10000      0.752       7520  4         9000      0.683       6147  5         6000      0.621       3726  Total present value    43679  (-) Investment         40000  NPV           3679   PI = 43679/40000 = 1.091 > 1 ⇒ Accept the project  References    External links  Use explained in the business book: Pursuing the Competitive Edge, Hayes, Pisano, Upton and Wheelwright.
