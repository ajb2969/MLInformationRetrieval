   Chebyshev distance      Chebyshev distance   In mathematics , Chebyshev distance (or Tchebychev distance ), maximum metric , or L ∞ metric 1 is a metric defined on a vector space where the distance between two vectors is the greatest of their differences along any coordinate dimension. 2 It is named after Pafnuty Chebyshev .  It is also known as chessboard distance , since in the game of chess the minimum number of moves needed by a king to go from one square on a chessboard to another equals the Chebyshev distance between the centers of the squares, if the squares have side length one, as represented in 2-D spatial coordinates with axes aligned to the edges of the board. 3 For example, the Chebyshev distance between f6 and e2 equals 4.  Definition  The Chebyshev distance between two vectors or points p and q , with standard coordinates    p  i     subscript  p  i    p_{i}   and    q  i     subscript  q  i    q_{i}   , respectively, is         D  Chebyshev    (  p  ,  q  )    :=    max  i    (   |    p  i   -   q  i    |   )     .     assign     subscript  D  Chebyshev    p  q      subscript   i        subscript  p  i    subscript  q  i        D_{\rm Chebyshev}(p,q):=\max_{i}(|p_{i}-q_{i}|).   This equals the limit of the L p metrics :        lim   k  →  ∞      (    ∑   i  =  1   n     |    p  i   -   q  i    |   k    )    1  /  k     ,      subscript    normal-→  k      superscript    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript       subscript  p  i    subscript  q  i     k      1  k      \lim_{k\to\infty}\bigg(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left|p_{i}-q_{i}\right|^{k}\bigg)^{1/k},   hence it is also known as the L ∞ metric.  Mathematically, the Chebyshev distance is a metric induced by the supremum norm or uniform norm . It is an example of an injective metric .  In two dimensions, i.e. plane geometry , if the points p and q have Cartesian coordinates     (   x  1   ,   y  1   )      subscript  x  1    subscript  y  1     (x_{1},y_{1})   and    (   x  2   ,   y  2   )      subscript  x  2    subscript  y  2     (x_{2},y_{2})   , their Chebyshev distance is        D  Chess   =   max   (   |    x  2   -   x  1    |   ,   |    y  2   -   y  1    |   )     .       subscript  D  Chess          subscript  x  2    subscript  x  1          subscript  y  2    subscript  y  1        D_{\rm Chess}=\max\left(\left|x_{2}-x_{1}\right|,\left|y_{2}-y_{1}\right|%
 \right).     Under this metric, a circle of radius  r , which is the set of points with Chebyshev distance r from a center point, is a square whose sides have the length 2 r and are parallel to the coordinate axes.  On a chess board, where one is using a discrete Chebyshev distance, rather than a continuous one, the circle of radius r is a square of side lengths 2 r, measuring from the centers of squares, and thus each side contains 2 r +1 squares; for example, the circle of radius 1 on a chess board is a 3×3 square.  Properties  In one dimension, all L p metrics are equal – they are just the absolute value of the difference.  The two dimensional Manhattan distance also has circles in the form of squares, with sides of length    2      2    \sqrt{2}    r , oriented at an angle of π/4 (45°) to the coordinate axes, so the planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to the planar Manhattan distance.  However, this equivalence between L 1 and L ∞ metrics does not generalize to higher dimensions. A sphere formed using the Chebyshev distance as a metric is a cube with each face perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes, but a sphere formed using Manhattan distance is an octahedron : these are dual polyhedra , but among cubes, only the square (and 1-dimensional line segment) are self-dual  polytopes .  The Chebyshev distance is sometimes used in warehouse  logistics , 4 as it effectively measures the time an overhead crane takes to move an object (as the crane can move on the x and y axes at the same time but at the same speed along each axis).  On a grid (such as a chessboard), the points at a Chebyshev distance of 1 of a point are the Moore neighborhood of that point.
