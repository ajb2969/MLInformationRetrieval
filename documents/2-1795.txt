   Admittance      Admittance   In electrical engineering , admittance is a measure of how easily a circuit or device will allow a current to flow. It is defined as the inverse of impedance . The SI unit of admittance is the siemens (symbol S). Oliver Heaviside coined the term admittance in December 1887. 1  Admittance is defined as      Y  ≡    1  Z        Y    1  Z     Y\equiv\frac{1}{Z}\,     where   Y is the admittance, measured in siemens   Z is the impedance, measured in ohms    The synonymous unit mho , and the symbol ℧ (an upside-down uppercase omega Ω), are also in common use.  Resistance is a measure of the opposition of a circuit to the flow of a steady current, while impedance takes into account not only the resistance but also dynamic effects (known as reactance ). Likewise, admittance is not only a measure of the ease with which a steady current can flow, but also the dynamic effects of the material's susceptance to polarization:      Y  =   G  +   j   B         Y    G    j  B      Y=G+jB\,     where      Y   Y   Y   is the admittance, measured in siemens.     G   G   G   is the conductance , measured in siemens.     B   B   B   is the susceptance , measured in siemens.       j  2   =   -  1        superscript  j  2     1     j^{2}=-1      Conversion from impedance to admittance  The impedance, Z, is composed of real and imaginary parts,      Z  =   R  +   j   X         Z    R    j  X      Z=R+jX\,   where   R is the resistance, measured in ohms  X is the reactance, measured in ohms       Y  =   Z   -  1    =   1   R  +   j  X     =    (   1    R  2   +   X  2     )    (   R  -   j  X    )          Y   superscript  Z    1           1    R    j  X              1     superscript  R  2    superscript  X  2       R    j  X        Y=Z^{-1}=\frac{1}{R+jX}=\left(\frac{1}{R^{2}+X^{2}}\right)\left(R-jX\right)     Admittance, just like impedance, is a complex number, made up of a real part (the conductance, G ), and an imaginary part (the susceptance, B ), thus:      Y  =   G  +   j  B        Y    G    j  B      Y=G+jB\,\!     where G (conductance) and B (susceptance) are given by:     G   G   \displaystyle G     The magnitude and phase of the admittance are given by:      |  Y  |      Y    \displaystyle\left|Y\right|     where   G is the conductance, measured in siemens  B is the susceptance, also measured in siemens   Note that (as shown above) the signs of reactances become reversed in the admittance domain; i.e. capacitive susceptance is positive and inductive susceptance is negative.
