Well equidistributed long-period linear

The Well Equidistributed Long-period Linear (WELL) is a pseudorandom number generator developed in 2006 by F. Panneton, P. L'Ecuyer, and M. Matsumoto 1 that is based on linear recurrences modulo 2 over a finite binary field

 
 .
There are a number of versions of the WELL generator proposed: WELL512a, WELL521a, WELL521b, WELL607a, WELL607b, WELL800a, WELL800b, WELL1024a, WELL1024b, WELL19937a, WELL19937b, WELL19937c, WELL21701a, WELL23209a, WELL23209b, WELL44497a, WELL44497b.
