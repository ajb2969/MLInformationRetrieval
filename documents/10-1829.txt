Chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase




Chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase

In enzymology, a chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + chondroitin 
 
 
 
  adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + chondroitin 6'-sulfate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and chondroitin, whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and Chondroitin 6-sulfate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:chondroitin 6'-sulfotransferase. Other names in common use include chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase, 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS):chondroitin sulfate, sulfotransferase, and terminal 6-sulfotransferase. This enzyme participates in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis and glycan structures - biosynthesis 1.
