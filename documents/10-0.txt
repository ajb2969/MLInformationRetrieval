   Carr index      Carr index   The Carr index (also: Carr's index 1 or Carr's Compressibility Index 2 ) is an indication of the compressibility of a powder . It is named after the pharmacologist Charles Jelleff Carr (1910–2005). 3 4 It measures the relative significance of interparticle interactions. 5  The Carr index is calculated by the formula     C  =   100     V  B   -   V  T     V  B         C    100       subscript  V  B    subscript  V  T     subscript  V  B       C=100\frac{V_{B}-V_{T}}{V_{B}}   , where    V  B     subscript  V  B    V_{B}   is the volume that a given mass of powder would occupy if let settled freely,  and     V  T     subscript  V  T    V_{T}    is the volume of the same mass of powder would occupy after "tapping down".  It can also be expressed as     C  =   100  ×   (   1  -    ρ  B    ρ  T     )        C    100    1     subscript  ρ  B    subscript  ρ  T        C=100\times(1-\frac{\rho_{B}}{\rho_{T}})    , where     ρ  B     subscript  ρ  B    \rho_{B}    is the freely settled bulk  density of the powder, and     ρ  T     subscript  ρ  T    \rho_{T}    is the tapped bulk density of the powder.  The Carr index is frequently used in pharmaceutics as an indication of the flowability of a powder. In a free-flowing powder, the bulk density and tapped density would be close in value, therefore, the Carr index would be small. On the other hand, in a poor-flowing powder where there are greater interparticle inter  actions, the difference between the bulk and tapped density observed would be greater, therefore, the Carr index would be larger. 6 A Carr index greater than 25 is considered to be an indication of poor flowability, and below 15, of good flowability.  7  Another way to measure the flow of a powder is the Hausner ratio , which can be expressed as    H  =    ρ  T   /   ρ  B        H     subscript  ρ  T    subscript  ρ  B      H=\rho_{T}/\rho_{B}   .  Both the Hausner ratio and the Carr index are sometimes criticized, despite their relationships to flowability being established empirically , as not having a strong theoretical basis. Use of these measures persists, however, because the equipment required to perform the analysis is relatively cheap and the technique is easy to learn.
