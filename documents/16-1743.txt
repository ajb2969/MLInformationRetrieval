   Serre's criterion on normality      Serre's criterion on normality   In algebra, Serre's criterion on normality , introduced by Jean-Pierre Serre , gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a commutative Noetherian ring  A to be a normal ring . The criterion involves the following two conditions for A :        R  k   :   A  𝔭      normal-:   subscript  R  k    subscript  A  𝔭     R_{k}:A_{\mathfrak{p}}   is a regular local ring for any prime ideal   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   of height ≤ k .       S  k   :    depth   A  𝔭    ≥   inf   {  k  ,   ht   (  𝔭  )    }        normal-:   subscript  S  k      depth   subscript  A  𝔭     infimum   k   ht  𝔭        S_{k}:\operatorname{depth}A_{\mathfrak{p}}\geq\inf\{k,\operatorname{ht}(%
 \mathfrak{p})\}   for any prime ideal   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   . 1   The statement is:   A is a reduced ring      ⇔    R  0   ,   S  1       normal-⇔  absent    subscript  R  0    subscript  S  1      \Leftrightarrow R_{0},S_{1}   hold.  A is a normal ring     ⇔    R  1   ,   S  2       normal-⇔  absent    subscript  R  1    subscript  S  2      \Leftrightarrow R_{1},S_{2}   hold.  A is a Cohen–Macaulay ring      ⇔   S  k      normal-⇔  absent   subscript  S  k     \Leftrightarrow S_{k}   hold for all k .   Items 1, 3 trivially follow from the definitions. Item 2 is much deeper.  For an integral domain, the criterion is due to Krull. The general case is due to Serre.  Proof  Sufficiency  (After EGA IV. Theorem 5.8.6.)  Suppose A satisfies S 2 and R 1 . Then A in particular satisfies S 1 and R 0 ; hence, it is reduced. If      𝔭  i   ,  1   ≤  i  ≤  r          subscript  𝔭  i   1   i       r     \mathfrak{p}_{i},\,1\leq i\leq r   are the minimal prime ideals of A , then the total ring of fractions  K of A is the direct product of the residue fields     κ   (   𝔭  i   )    =   Q   (   A  /   𝔭  i    )          κ   subscript  𝔭  i      Q    A   subscript  𝔭  i       \kappa(\mathfrak{p}_{i})=Q(A/\mathfrak{p}_{i})   : see total ring of fractions of a reduced ring . That means we can write    1  =    e  1   +  …  +   e  r        1     subscript  e  1   normal-…   subscript  e  r      1=e_{1}+\dots+e_{r}   where    e  i     subscript  e  i    e_{i}   are idempotents in    κ   (   𝔭  i   )       κ   subscript  𝔭  i     \kappa(\mathfrak{p}_{i})   and such that       e  i    e  j    =  0   ,   i  ≠  j      formulae-sequence       subscript  e  i    subscript  e  j    0     i  j     e_{i}e_{j}=0,\,i\neq j   . Now, if A is integrally closed in K , then each    e  i     subscript  e  i    e_{i}   is integral over A and so is in A ; consequently, A is a direct product of integrally closed domains Ae i 's and we are done. Thus, it is enough to show that A is integrally closed in K .  For this end, suppose         (   f  /  g   )   n   +    a  1     (   f  /  g   )    n  -  1     +  …  +   a  n    =  0         superscript    f  g   n      subscript  a  1    superscript    f  g     n  1     normal-…   subscript  a  n    0    (f/g)^{n}+a_{1}(f/g)^{n-1}+\dots+a_{n}=0   where all f , g , a i 's are in A and g is moreover a non-zerodivisor. We want to show:      f  ∈   g  A       f    g  A     f\in gA   . Now, the condition S 2 says that    g  A      g  A    gA   is unmixed of height one; i.e., each associated primes    𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   of     A  /  g   A        A  g   A    A/gA   has height one. By the condition R 1 , the localization    A  𝔭     subscript  A  𝔭    A_{\mathfrak{p}}   is integrally closed and so     ϕ   (  f  )    ∈   ϕ   (  g  )    A  𝔭          ϕ  f     ϕ  g   subscript  A  𝔭      \phi(f)\in\phi(g)A_{\mathfrak{p}}   , where    ϕ  :   A  →   A  𝔭       normal-:  ϕ   normal-→  A   subscript  A  𝔭      \phi:A\to A_{\mathfrak{p}}   is the localization map, since the integral equation persists after localization. If     g  A   =    ∩  i    𝔮  i          g  A     subscript   i    subscript  𝔮  i      gA=\cap_{i}\mathfrak{q}_{i}   is the primary decomposition , then, for any i , the radical of    𝔮  i     subscript  𝔮  i    \mathfrak{q}_{i}   is an associated prime   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   of     A  /  g   A        A  g   A    A/gA   and so    f  ∈    ϕ   -  1     (    𝔮  i    A  𝔭    )    =   𝔮  i         f     superscript  ϕ    1       subscript  𝔮  i    subscript  A  𝔭           subscript  𝔮  i      f\in\phi^{-1}(\mathfrak{q}_{i}A_{\mathfrak{p}})=\mathfrak{q}_{i}   ; the equality here is because    𝔮  i     subscript  𝔮  i    \mathfrak{q}_{i}   is a   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   - primary ideal . Hence, the assertion holds.  Necessity  Suppose A is a normal ring . For S 2 , let   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   be an associated prime of     A  /  f   A        A  f   A    A/fA   for a non-zerodivisor f ; we need to show it has height one. Replacing A by a localization, we can assume A is a local ring with maximal ideal   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   . By definition, there is an element g in A such that    𝔭  =   {   x  ∈  A   |    x  g   ≡   0  mod  f  A    }       𝔭   conditional-set    x  A       x  g     0  mod  f  A       \mathfrak{p}=\{x\in A|xg\equiv 0\text{ mod }fA\}   and    g  ∉   f  A       g    f  A     g\not\in fA   . Put y = g / f in the total ring of fractions. If     y  𝔭   ⊂  𝔭        y  𝔭   𝔭    y\mathfrak{p}\subset\mathfrak{p}   , then   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   is a faithful    A   [  y  ]       A   delimited-[]  y     A[y]   -module and is a finitely generated A -module; consequently,   y   y   y   is integral over A and thus in A , a contradiction. Hence,     y  𝔭   =  A        y  𝔭   A    y\mathfrak{p}=A   or    𝔭  =    f  /  g   A       𝔭      f  g   A     \mathfrak{p}=f/gA   , which implies   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   has height one ( Krull's principal ideal theorem ).  For R 1 , we argue in the same way: let   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   be a prime ideal of height one. Localizing at   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   we assume   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   is a maximal ideal and the similar argument as above shows that   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   is in fact principal. Thus, A is a regular local ring.   □   normal-□   \square     Notes  References    H. Matsumura, Commutative algebra , 1970.   "  Category:Theorems in abstract algebra  Category:Ring theory     ↩
