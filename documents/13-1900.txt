   Open statistical ensemble      Open statistical ensemble   The Open statistical ensemble (OSE) corresponds to a physical system that exchanges energy and particles with a reservoir at a given temperature and chemical potential, thus being at thermodynamic equilibrium with it, and in addition correctly takes into account the surface terms.  The open statistical ensemble is similar to the grand canonical ensemble (GCE) with the key difference being that the OSE has no fictitious surface on its boundaries.  The expression for the partition function of the ensemble is similar to the partition function of the grand canonical ensemble (GCE), with the replacement of the Boltzmann factor in terms of the series on the distribution functions of special form.  The coefficient of surface tension , included in the partition function, corresponds to the interface of a fluid and a hard solid, due to respecting probability and potential limitations.  Unlike the GCE, for OSE the average number of particles in a given volume coincides with the volume term. Also in contrast to the GCE, the correlation and distribution functions of the OSE strictly satisfy the requirement of translational invariance .  The expression for the general term of the distribution has the form        p  m  v   =     z  m     m  !    Υ  v       ∑   t  =  0   ∞      z  t    t  !     ∫    [    ∏   i  =  1   m     ∏   j  =   m  +  1     m  +  t      ψ  i  v    χ  j  v      ]    ℬ    1...  m   +  t    (  m  ,  t  )    d   𝒓  1   …  d   𝒓   m  +  t          ,       subscript   superscript  p  v   m        superscript  z  m       m    subscript  normal-Υ  v       superscript   subscript     t  0           superscript  z  t     t         delimited-[]    superscript   subscript  product    i  1    m     superscript   subscript  product    j    m  1       m  t       subscript   superscript  ψ  v   i    subscript   superscript  χ  v   j        subscript   superscript  ℬ   m  t        1...  m   t    d   subscript  𝒓  1   normal-…  d   subscript  𝒓    m  t           p^{v}_{m}=\frac{z^{m}}{m!\Upsilon_{v}}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{t}}{t!}\int%

This expression shows that the GCE is a low-density approximation of the OSE.

Collapsing the series of activities for     Υ   v     subscript  normal-Υ  v    ~{}\Upsilon_{v}   we obtain the alternative representation         Υ   v   =    exp  β    [    v  P   (  z  ,  T  )    +   a  σ   (  z  ,  T  )     ]     ,       subscript  normal-Υ  v       β    delimited-[]      v  P   z  T      a  σ   z  T         ~{}\Upsilon_{v}=\exp{\beta[vP(z,T)+a\sigma(z,T)]},     where     P    (  z  ,  T  )       P   z  T     ~{}P(z,T)   is the pressure,     σ    (  z  ,  T  )       σ   z  T     ~{}\sigma(z,T)   the coefficient of surface tension on the interface of the fluid and hard solid and    a    a   ~{}a   is the surface bounding the system.  It should be stressed that an open system does not singled out, and the surface tension is created due to the fluctuation component of the partition function.  The last expression is exactly consistent with the probability of the formation of the hole volume    v    v   ~{}v   in the fluid        p   0  v   =   e   -   β   (    v  P   (  z  ,  T  )    +   a  σ   (  z  ,  T  )     )           subscript   superscript  p  v   0    superscript  e      β      v  P   z  T      a  σ   z  T          ~{}p^{v}_{0}=e^{-\beta\left(vP{\left(z,T\right)}+a\sigma{\left(z,T\right)}%

Some properties of the OSE   Scale invariance. In contrast to grand canonical ensemble, an open statistical ensemble satisfies the scale invariance requirement: general term of the included subsystem distribution corresponds to that of the original system.    Application to small systems. This distribution may be applied to however small volumes including those less than the size of a molecule. In this case it degenerates into a Bernoulli distribution with     p   =   ϱ  v       p    ϱ  v     ~{}p=\varrho v   .    Separation of fluctuations. When the volume is much greater than the size of the molecule, the squared deviation of the number of particles is divided into bulk and surface terms.   References   Zaskulnikov V.
