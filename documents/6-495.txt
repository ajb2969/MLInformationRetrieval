   Covering system      Covering system   In mathematics , a covering system (also called a complete residue system ) is a collection      {    a  1    (    mod    n  1    )    ,  …  ,    a  k    (    mod    n  k    )    }        subscript  a  1     mod   subscript  n  1     normal-…     subscript  a  k     mod   subscript  n  k       \{a_{1}(\mathrm{mod}\ {n_{1}}),\ \ldots,\ a_{k}(\mathrm{mod}\ {n_{k}})\}     of finitely many residue classes       a  i    (    mod    n  i    )    =   {    a  i   +    n  i   x    :   x  ∈   \Z    }          subscript  a  i     mod   subscript  n  i      conditional-set     subscript  a  i      subscript  n  i   x      x  \Z      a_{i}(\mathrm{mod}\ {n_{i}})=\{a_{i}+n_{i}x:\ x\in\Z\}   whose union contains every integer.  Examples and definitions  The notion of covering system was introduced by Paul Erdős in the early 1930s.  The following are examples of covering systems:       {   0   (   mod  3   )    ,   1   (   mod  3   )    ,   2   (   mod  3   )    }   ,       0    mod  3      1    mod  3      2    mod  3      \{0(\mathrm{mod}\ {3}),\ 1(\mathrm{mod}\ {3}),\ 2(\mathrm{mod}\ {3})\},     and       {   1   (   mod  2   )    ,   2   (   mod  4   )    ,   4   (   mod  8   )    ,   0   (   mod  8   )    }   ,       1    mod  2      2    mod  4      4    mod  8      0    mod  8      \{1(\mathrm{mod}\ {2}),\ 2(\mathrm{mod}\ {4}),\ 4(\mathrm{mod}\ {8}),\ 0(%
 \mathrm{mod}\ {8})\},     and       {   0   (   mod  2   )    ,   0   (   mod  3   )    ,   1   (   mod  4   )    ,   5   (   mod  6   )    ,   7   (   mod  12   )    }   .       0    mod  2      0    mod  3      1    mod  4      5    mod  6      7    mod  12      \{0(\mathrm{mod}\ {2}),\ 0(\mathrm{mod}\ {3}),\ 1(\mathrm{mod}\ {4}),\ 5(%
 \mathrm{mod}\ {6}),\ 7(\mathrm{mod}\ {12})\}.     A covering system is called disjoint (or exact ) if no two members overlap.  A covering system is called distinct (or incongruent ) if all the moduli    n  i     subscript  n  i    n_{i}   are different (and bigger than 1).  A covering system is called irredundant (or minimal ) if all the residue classes are required to cover the integers.  The first two examples are disjoint.  The third example is distinct.  A system (i.e., an unordered multi-set)      {    a  1    (    mod    n  1    )    ,  …  ,    a  k    (    mod    n  k    )    }        subscript  a  1     mod   subscript  n  1     normal-…     subscript  a  k     mod   subscript  n  k       \{a_{1}(\mathrm{mod}\ {n_{1}}),\ \ldots,\ a_{k}(\mathrm{mod}\ {n_{k}})\}     of finitely many residue classes is called an   m   m   m   -cover if it covers every integer at least   m   m   m   times, and an exact    m   m   m   -cover if it covers each integer exactly   m   m   m   times. It is known that for each    m  =   2  ,  3  ,  …       m   2  3  normal-…     m=2,3,\ldots   there are exact   m   m   m   -covers which cannot be written as a union of two covers. For example,      {  1   (  mod  2  )   ;  0   (  mod  3  )   ;  2   (  mod  6  )   ;  0  ,  4  ,  6  ,  8   (  mod  10  )   ;     fragments  normal-{  1   fragments  normal-(  mod  2  normal-)   normal-;  0   fragments  normal-(  mod  3  normal-)   normal-;  2   fragments  normal-(  mod  6  normal-)   normal-;  0  normal-,  4  normal-,  6  normal-,  8   fragments  normal-(  mod  10  normal-)   normal-;    \{1(\mathrm{mod}\ {2});\ 0(\mathrm{mod}\ {3});\ 2(\mathrm{mod}\ {6});\ 0,4,6,8%
 (\mathrm{mod}\ {10});         1  ,  2  ,  4  ,  7  ,  10  ,  13   (  mod  15  )   ;  5  ,  11  ,  12  ,  22  ,  23  ,  29   (  mod  30  )   }     fragments  1  normal-,  2  normal-,  4  normal-,  7  normal-,  10  normal-,  13   fragments  normal-(  mod  15  normal-)   normal-;  5  normal-,  11  normal-,  12  normal-,  22  normal-,  23  normal-,  29   fragments  normal-(  mod  30  normal-)   normal-}    1,2,4,7,10,13(\mathrm{mod}\ {15});\ 5,11,12,22,23,29(\mathrm{mod}\ {30})\}     is an exact 2-cover which is not a union of two covers.  Mirsky–Newman theorem  The Mirsky–Newman theorem, a special case of the Herzog–Schönheim conjecture , states that there is no disjoint distinct covering system. This result was conjectured in 1950 by Paul Erdős and proved soon thereafter by Leon Mirsky and Donald J. Newman . However, Mirsky and Newman never published their proof. The same proof was also found independently by Harold Davenport and Richard Rado . 1  Primefree sequences  Covering systems can be used to find primefree sequences , sequences of integers satisfying the same recurrence relation as the Fibonacci numbers , such that consecutive numbers in the sequence are relatively prime but all numbers in the sequence are composite numbers . For instance, a sequence of this type found by Herbert Wilf has initial terms   a 1 = 20615674205555510, a 2 = 3794765361567513 .   In this sequence, the positions at which the numbers in the sequence are divisible by a prime p form an arithmetic progression; for instance, the even numbers in the sequence are the numbers a i where i is congruent to 1 mod 3. The progressions divisible by different primes form a covering system, showing that every number in the sequence is divisible by at least one prime.  Some unsolved problems  Paul Erdős asked whether for any arbitrarily large N there exists an incongruent covering system the minimum of whose moduli is at least N . It is easy to construct examples where the minimum of the moduli in such a system is 2, or 3 (Erdős gave an example where the moduli are in the set of the divisors of 120; a suitable cover is 0(3), 0(4), 0(5), 1(6), 1(8), 2(10), 11(12), 1(15), 14(20), 5(24), 8(30), 6(40), 58(60), 26(120) ); D. Swift gave an example where the minimum of the moduli is 4 (and the moduli are in the set of the divisors of 2880). S. L. G. Choi proved 2 that it is possible to give an example for N = 20, and Pace P Nielsen demonstrates 3 the existence of an example with N = 40, consisting of more than    10  50     superscript  10  50    10^{50}   congruences.  It appears that this problem was solved negatively by Bob Hough, who talked about his work at the Erdős centennial conference in Budapest on July 3 2013. 4 He used the Lovász local lemma to show that there is some maximum N which can be the minimum modulus on a covering system. The proof is in principle effective , though an explicit bound is not given.  In another problem we want that all of the moduli (of an incongruent covering system) be odd. There is a famous unsolved conjecture from Erdős and Selfridge : an incongruent covering system (with the minimum modulus greater than 1) whose moduli are odd, does not exist. It is known that if such a system exists with square-free moduli, the overall modulus must have at least 22 prime factors. 5  See also   Chinese remainder theorem  Covering set  Residue number system   References     External links   Zhi-Wei Sun : Problems and Results on Covering Systems (a survey) ( PDF )  Zhi-Wei Sun: Classified Publications on Covering Systems (PDF)   "  Category:Number theory  Category:Unsolved problems in mathematics     . ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
