   Ordered vector space      Ordered vector space   In mathematics an ordered vector space or partially ordered vector space is a vector space equipped with a partial order which is compatible with the vector space operations.  Definition  Given a vector space V over the real numbers  R and a partial order ≤ on the set  V , the pair ( V , ≤) is called an ordered vector space if for all x , y , z in V and 0 ≤ λ in R the following two axioms are satisfied   x ≤ y implies x + z ≤ y + z  y ≤ x implies λ y ≤ λ x .   Notes  The two axioms imply that translations and positive homotheties are automorphisms of the order structure and the mapping f ( x ) = − x is an isomorphism to the dual order structure .  If ≤ is only a preorder , ( V , ≤) is called a preordered vector space .  Ordered vector spaces are ordered groups under their addition operation.  Positive cone  Given an ordered vector space V , the subset V + of all elements x in V satisfying x ≥0 is a convex cone , called the positive cone of V . Since the partial order ≥ is antisymmetric , one can show, that V + ∩(− V + )={0}, hence V + is a proper cone . That it is convex can be seen by combining the above two axioms with the transitivity property of the (pre)order.  If V is a real vector space and C is a proper convex cone in V , there exists exactly one partial order on   V   V   V   that makes V into an ordered vector space such V + = C . This partial order is given by   x ≤ y if and only if y − x is in C .   Therefore, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the partial orders on a vector space V that are compatible with the vector space structure and the proper convex cones of V .  Examples   The real numbers with the usual order is an ordered vector space.  R 2 is an ordered vector space with the ≤ relation defined in any of the following ways (in order of increasing strength, i.e., decreasing sets of pairs):  Lexicographical order : ( a , b ) ≤ ( c , d ) if and only if a 0 or ( x = 0 and y ≥ 0), i.e., in polar coordinates , the set of points with the angular coordinate satisfying -π/2 < θ ≤ π/2, together with the origin.  ( a , b ) ≤ ( c , d ) if and only if a ≤ c and b ≤ d (the product order of two copies of R with "≤"). This is a partial order. The positive cone is given by x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0, i.e., in polar coordinates 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2, together with the origin.  ( a , b ) ≤ ( c , d ) if and only if ( a 0 and y > 0) or ( x = y = 0), i.e., in polar coordinates, 0 < θ < π/2, together with the origin.     Only the second order is, as a subset of R 4 , closed, see partial orders in topological spaces .  For the third order the two-dimensional " intervals " p < x < q are open sets which generate the topology.    R n is an ordered vector space with the ≤ relation defined similarly. For example, for the second order mentioned above:  x ≤ y if and only if x i ≤ y i for i = 1, …, n .   A Riesz space is an ordered vector space where the order gives rise to a lattice .  The space of continuous function on [0,1] where f ≤ g iff f(x) ≤ g(x) for all x in [0,1]   Remarks   An interval in a partially ordered vector space is a convex set . If [ a , b ] = { x : a ≤ x ≤ b }, from axioms 1 and 2 above it follows that x , y in [ a , b ] and λ in (0,1) implies λ x +(1-λ) y in [ a , b ].
