   Sperner's theorem      Sperner's theorem   Sperner's theorem , in discrete mathematics , describes the largest possible families of finite sets none of which contain any other sets in the family. It is one of the central results in extremal set theory , and is named after Emanuel Sperner , who published it in 1928.  This result is sometimes called Sperner's lemma, but the name " Sperner's lemma " also refers to an unrelated result on coloring triangulations. To differentiate the two results, the result on the size of a Sperner family is now more commonly known as Sperner's theorem.  Statement  A family of sets that does not include two sets X and Y for which X ‚äÇ Y is called a Sperner family . For example, the family of k -element subsets of an n -element set is a Sperner family. No set in this family can contain any of the others, because a containing set has to be strictly bigger than the set it contains, and in this family all sets have equal size. The value of k that makes this example have as many sets as possible is n /2 if n is even, or the nearest integer to n /2 if n is odd. For this choice, the number of sets in the family is    (      n       ‚åä   n  /  2   ‚åã       )     binomial  n      n  2      {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}}\right)}   .  Sperner's theorem states that these examples are the largest possible Sperner families over an n -element set. Formally, the theorem states that, for every Sperner family S whose union has a total of n elements,        |  S  |   ‚â§   (     n       ‚åä   n  /  2   ‚åã      )    .        S    binomial  n      n  2       |S|\leq{\left({{n}\atop{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}}\right)}.     Partial orders  Sperner's theorem can also be stated in terms of partial order width . The family of all subsets of an n -element set (its power set ) can be partially ordered by set inclusion; in this partial order, two distinct elements are said to be incomparable when neither of them contains the other. The width of a partial order is the largest number of elements in an antichain , a set of pairwise incomparable elements. Translating this terminology into the language of sets, an antichain is just a Sperner family, and the width of the partial order is the maximum number of sets in a Sperner family. Thus, another way of stating Sperner's theorem is that the width of the inclusion order on a power set is    (      n       ‚åä   n  /  2   ‚åã       )     binomial  n      n  2      {\left({{n}\atop{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}}\right)}   .  A graded  partially ordered set is said to have the Sperner property when one of its largest antichains is formed by a set of elements that all have the same rank. In this terminology, Sperner's theorem states that the partially ordered set of all subsets of a finite set, partially ordered by set inclusion, has the Sperner property.  Proof  The following proof is due to . Let s k denote the number of k -sets in S . For all 0 ‚â§ k ‚â§ n ,       (     n       ‚åä   n  /  2   ‚åã      )   ‚â•   (     n      k     )        binomial  n      n  2      binomial  n  k     {n\choose\lfloor{n/2}\rfloor}\geq{n\choose k}     and, thus,         s  k    (      n       ‚åä   n  /  2   ‚åã       )    ‚â§    s  k    (      n      k      )     .         subscript  s  k    binomial  n      n  2         subscript  s  k    binomial  n  k      {s_{k}\over{n\choose\lfloor{n/2}\rfloor}}\leq{s_{k}\over{n\choose k}}.     Since S is an antichain, we can sum over the above inequality from k = 0 to n and then apply the LYM inequality to obtain         ‚àë   k  =  0   n     s  k    (      n       ‚åä   n  /  2   ‚åã       )     ‚â§    ‚àë   k  =  0   n     s  k    (      n      k      )     ‚â§  1   ,          superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  s  k    binomial  n      n  2         superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  s  k    binomial  n  k          1     \sum_{k=0}^{n}{s_{k}\over{n\choose\lfloor{n/2}\rfloor}}\leq\sum_{k=0}^{n}{s_{k%
 }\over{n\choose k}}\leq 1,     which means        |  S  |   =    ‚àë   k  =  0   n    s  k    ‚â§   (     n       ‚åä   n  /  2   ‚åã      )    .          S     superscript   subscript     k  0    n    subscript  s  k          binomial  n      n  2        |S|=\sum_{k=0}^{n}s_{k}\leq{n\choose\lfloor{n/2}\rfloor}.     This completes the proof.  Generalizations  There are several generalizations of Sperner's theorem for subsets of     ùí´   (  E  )    ,      ùí´  E    \mathcal{P}(E),   the poset of all subsets of E .  No long chains  A chain is a subfamily     {   S  0   ,   S  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   S  r   }   ‚äÜ   ùí´   (  E  )          subscript  S  0    subscript  S  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  S  r      ùí´  E     \{S_{0},S_{1},\dots,S_{r}\}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(E)   that is totally ordered, i.e.,     S  0   ‚äÇ   S  1   ‚äÇ  ‚Ä¶  ‚äÇ   S  r          subscript  S  0    subscript  S  1        normal-‚Ä¶        subscript  S  r      S_{0}\subset S_{1}\subset\dots\subset S_{r}   (possibly after renumbering). The chain has r + 1 members and length  r . An r -chain-free family ' (also called an ''r -family''') is a family of subsets of E that contains no chain of length r .  proved that the largest size of an r -chain-free family is the sum of the r largest binomial coefficients    (      n      i      )     binomial  n  i    {\left({{n}\atop{i}}\right)}   . The case r = 1 is Sperner's theorem.  p -compositions of a set  In the set    ùí´    (  E  )   p       ùí´   superscript  E  p     \mathcal{P}(E)^{p}   of p -tuples of subsets of E , we say a p -tuple    (   S  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   S  p   )      subscript  S  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  S  p     (S_{1},\dots,S_{p})   is ‚â§ another one,     (   T  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   T  p   )   ,      subscript  T  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  T  p     (T_{1},\dots,T_{p}),   if     S  i   ‚äÜ   T  i        subscript  S  i    subscript  T  i     S_{i}\subseteq T_{i}   for each i = 1,2,..., p . We call    (   S  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   S  p   )      subscript  S  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  S  p     (S_{1},\dots,S_{p})   a p -composition of  E if the sets     S  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   S  p       subscript  S  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  S  p     S_{1},\dots,S_{p}   form a partition of E .  proved that the maximum size of an antichain of p -compositions is the largest p -multinomial coefficient     (      n         n  1      n  2     ‚Ä¶    n  p        )   ,     binomial  n     subscript  n  1    subscript  n  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  n  p      {\left({{n}\atop{n_{1}\ n_{2}\ \dots\ n_{p}}}\right)},   that is, the coefficient in which all n i are as nearly equal as possible (i.e., they differ by at most 1). Meshalkin proved this by proving a generalized LYM inequality.  The case p = 2 is Sperner's theorem, because then     S  2   =   E  ‚àñ   S  1         subscript  S  2     E   subscript  S  1      S_{2}=E\setminus S_{1}   and the assumptions reduce to the sets    S  1     subscript  S  1    S_{1}   being a Sperner family.  No long chains in p -compositions of a set  combined the Erd√∂s and Meshalkin theorems by adapting Meshalkin's proof of his generalized LYM inequality. They showed that the largest size of a family of p -compositions such that the sets in the i -th position of the p -tuples, ignoring duplications, are r -chain-free, for every    i  =   1  ,  2  ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   p  -  1        i   1  2  normal-‚Ä¶    p  1      i=1,2,\dots,p-1   (but not necessarily for i = p ), is not greater than the sum of the    r   p  -  1      superscript  r    p  1     r^{p-1}   largest p -multinomial coefficients.  Projective geometry analog  In the finite projective geometry PG( d , F q ) of dimension d over a finite field of order q , let    ‚Ñí   (  p  ,   F  q   )       ‚Ñí   p   subscript  F  q      \mathcal{L}(p,F_{q})   be the family of all subspaces. When partially ordered by set inclusion, this family is a lattice.  proved that the largest size of an antichain in    ‚Ñí   (  p  ,   F  q   )       ‚Ñí   p   subscript  F  q      \mathcal{L}(p,F_{q})   is the largest Gaussian coefficient      [      d  +  1       k     ]   ;        d  1     k     \begin{bmatrix}d+1\\
 k\end{bmatrix};   this is the projective-geometry analog, or q -analog , of Sperner's theorem.  They further proved that the largest size of an r -chain-free family in    ‚Ñí   (  p  ,   F  q   )       ‚Ñí   p   subscript  F  q      \mathcal{L}(p,F_{q})   is the sum of the r largest Gaussian coefficients. Their proof is by a projective analog of the LYM inequality.  No long chains in p -compositions of a projective space  obtained a Meshalkin-like generalization of the Rota‚ÄìHarper theorem. In PG( d , F q ), a Meshalkin sequence of length p is a sequence    (   A  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   A  p   )      subscript  A  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  A  p     (A_{1},\ldots,A_{p})   of projective subspaces such that no proper subspace of PG( d , F q ) contains them all and their dimensions sum to     d  -  p   +  1        d  p   1    d-p+1   . The theorem is that a family of Meshalkin sequences of length p in PG( d , F q ), such that the subspaces appearing in position i of the sequences contain no chain of length r for each     i  =   1  ,  2  ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   p  -  1     ,      i   1  2  normal-‚Ä¶    p  1      i=1,2,\dots,p-1,   is not more than the sum of the largest    r   p  -  1      superscript  r    p  1     r^{p-1}   of the quantities        [      d  +  1          n  1      n  2     ‚Ä¶    n  p       ]    q    s  2    (   n  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   n  p   )      ,          d  1        subscript  n  1    subscript  n  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  n  p       superscript  q     subscript  s  2     subscript  n  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  n  p        \begin{bmatrix}d+1\\
