Q-Meixner–Pollaczek polynomials

In mathematics, the q-Meixner–Pollaczek polynomials are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme.  give a detailed list of their properties.
Definition
The polynomials are given in terms of basic hypergeometric functions and the Pochhammer symbol by ：1
