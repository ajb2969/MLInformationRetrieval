   Aldose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase      Aldose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase   In enzymology , an aldose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ADP + alpha-D-aldose 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phosphate + ADP-aldose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ADP and alpha-D-aldose 1-phosphate , whereas its two products are phosphate and ADP-aldose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ADP:alpha-D-aldose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase . Other names in common use include sugar-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase , ADPaldose phosphorylase , adenosine diphosphosugar phosphorylase , ADP sugar phosphorylase , adenosine diphosphate glucose:orthophosphate adenylyltransferase , and ADP:aldose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase .
