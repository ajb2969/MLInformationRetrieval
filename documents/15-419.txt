   Douady–Earle extension      Douady–Earle extension  In [[mathematics]], the '''Douady–Earle extension''', named after [[Adrie n Douady]] and Clifford Earle, is a way of extending homeomorphisms of the unit circle in the complex plane to homeomorphisms of the closed unit disk, such that the extension is a diffeomorphism of the open disk. The extension is analytic on the open disk. The extension has an important equivariance property: if the homeomorphism is composed on either side with a Möbius transformation preserving the unit circle the extension is also obtained by composition with the same Möbius transformation. If the homeomorphism is quasisymmetric , the diffeomorphism is quasiconformal . An extension for quasisymmetric homeomorphisms had previously been given by Ahlfors and Arne Beurling ; a different equivariant construction had been given in 1985 by Pekka Tukia. Equivariant extensions have important applications in Teichmüller theory , for example they lead to a quick proof of the contractibility of the Teichmüller space of a Fuchsian group .  Definition  By the Radó–Kneser–Choquet theorem , the Poisson integral  F f of a homeomorphism f of the circle defines a harmonic diffeomorphism of the unit disk extending f . If f is quasisymmetric , the extension is not necessarily quasiconformal, i.e. the complex dilatation        μ   (  z  )    =     ∂   z  ¯     F  f      ∂  z    F  f      ,        μ  z       subscript    normal-¯  z     subscript  F  f      subscript   z    subscript  F  f       \displaystyle{\mu(z)={\partial_{\overline{z}}F_{f}\over\partial_{z}F_{f}},}     does not necessarily satisfy        sup    |  z  |   <  1     |   μ   (  z  )    |    <  1.        subscript  supremum      z   1        μ  z     1.    \displaystyle{\sup_{|z|<1}|\mu(z)|<1.}     However F can be used to define another analytic extension H f of f −1 which does satisfy this condition. It follows that       E   (  f  )    =   H   f   -  1           E  f    subscript  H   superscript  f    1       \displaystyle{E(f)=H_{f^{-1}}}     is the required extension.  For | a | \displaystyle{g_a(z)= {z-a\over 1- \overline{a}z}.}  It preserves the unit circle and unit disk sending a to 0.  If g is any Möbius transformation preserving the unit circle and disk, then        F   f  ∘  g    =    F  f   ∘  g    .       subscript  F    f  g       subscript  F  f   g     \displaystyle{F_{f\circ g}=F_{f}\circ g.}     For | a | \displaystyle{w=H_f(a)}  to be the unique w with | w | \displaystyle{F_{g_a\circ f}(w) =0.}  For | a | =1 set         H  f    (  a  )    =    f   -  1     (  a  )     .         subscript  H  f   a      superscript  f    1    a     \displaystyle{H_{f}(a)=f^{-1}(a).}     Properties   Compatibility with Möbius transformations. By construction          H   g  ∘  f  ∘  h    =    h   -  1    ∘   H  f   ∘   g   -  1          subscript  H    g  f  h       superscript  h    1     subscript  H  f    superscript  g    1       \displaystyle{H_{g\circ f\circ h}=h^{-1}\circ H_{f}\circ g^{-1}}         for any Möbius transformations g and h preserving the unit circle and disk.

By the dominated convergence theorem, it follows that Φ( z n , w n ) has a non-zero limit if w ≠ H f ( z ). This implies that H f is continuous on the closed unit disk. Indeed otherwise, by compactness, there would be a sequence z n tending to z in the closed disk, with w n = H f ( z n ) tending to a limit w ≠ H f ( z ). But then Φ( z n , w n ) = 0 so has limit zero, a contradiction, since w ≠ H f ( z ).    Smoothness and non-vanishing Jacobian on open disk.  H f is smooth with nowhere vanishing Jacobian on | z | f is smooth near 0 and has non-vanishing derivative at 0.    If f has Fourier series           f   (   e   i  θ    )    =     ∑  m      a  m    e   i  m  θ       ,        f   superscript  e    i  θ       subscript   m      subscript  a  m    superscript  e    i  m  θ        \displaystyle{f(e^{i\theta})=\sum_{m}a_{m}e^{im\theta},}         then the derivatives of F f at 0 are given by              ∂  z    F  f     (  0  )    =   a  1    ,      ∂   z  ¯     F  f     (  0  )    =   a   -  1      .     formulae-sequence        subscript   z    subscript  F  f    0    subscript  a  1          subscript    normal-¯  z     subscript  F  f    0    subscript  a    1       \displaystyle{\partial_{z}F_{f}(0)=a_{1},\,\,\,\partial_{\overline{z}}F_{f}(0)%

 =|a_{1}|^{2}-|a_{-1}|^{2}.}         Since F f is an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism, its Jacobian is positive:            |   a  1   |   2   -    |   a   -  1    |   2    >  0.         superscript     subscript  a  1    2    superscript     subscript  a    1     2    0.    \displaystyle{|a_{1}|^{2}-|a_{-1}|^{2}>0.}         The function Φ( z , w ) is analytic and so smooth.

If the right hand side vanished, then equality would occur in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality forcing          f   (   e   i  θ    )    =   ζ    f   (   e   i  θ    )    ¯          f   superscript  e    i  θ       ζ   normal-¯    f   superscript  e    i  θ         \displaystyle{f(e^{i\theta})=\zeta\overline{f(e^{i\theta})}}         for some ζ in T and for all θ, a contradiction since f assumes all values in T . The left hand side is therefore strictly positive and | b | < 1.    Consequently the implicit function theorem can be applied. It implies that H f ( z ) is smooth near o.

 \left(-{a_{-1}\over\overline{a_{1}}}\right).}         Homeomorphism on closed disk and diffeomorphism on open disk. It is enough to show that H f is a homeomorphism. By continuity its image is compact so closed. The non-vanishing of the Jacobian, implies that H f is an open mapping on the unit disk, so that the image of the open disk is open. Hence the image of the closed disk is an open and closed subset of the closed disk. By connectivity, it must be the whole disk. For | w | f is locally a homeomorphism, it must be a finite set. The set of points w in the open disk with exactly n preimages is open. By connectivity every point has the same number N of preimages. Since the open disk is simply connected , N = 1. (In fact taking any preimage of the origin, every radial line has a unique lifting to a preimage, and so there is an open subset of the unit disk mapping homeomorphically onto the open disc. If N > 1, its complement would also have to be open, contradicting connectivity.)   Extension of quasi-Möbius homeomorphisms  In this section it is established that the extension of a quasisymmetric homeomorphism is quasiconformal . Fundamental use is made of the notion of quasi-Möbius homeomorphism .  A homeomorphism f of the circle is quasisymmetric if there are constants a , b > 0 such that         |    f   (   z  1   )    -   f   (   z  2   )     |    |    f   (   z  1   )    -   f   (   z  3   )     |    ≤   a     |    z  1   -   z  2    |   b     |    z  1   -   z  3    |   b      .              f   subscript  z  1      f   subscript  z  2            f   subscript  z  1      f   subscript  z  3         a     superscript       subscript  z  1    subscript  z  2     b    superscript       subscript  z  1    subscript  z  3     b       \displaystyle{{|f(z_{1})-f(z_{2})|\over|f(z_{1})-f(z_{3})|}\leq a{|z_{1}-z_{2}%

If f is quasisymmetric then it is also quasi-Möbius, with c = a 2 and d = b : this follows by multiplying the first inequality for ( z 1 , z 3 , z 4 ) and ( z 2 , z 4 , z 3 ). (Conversely  has shown that a quasi-Möbius homeomorphism is also quasisymmetric.)  It is immediate that the quasi-Möbius homeomorphisms are closed under the operations of inversion and composition.  The complex dilatation μ of a diffeomorphism F of the unit disk is defined by         μ  F    (  z  )    =      ∂   z  ¯    F    (  z  )       ∂  z   F    (  z  )      .         subscript  μ  F   z         subscript    normal-¯  z    F   z       subscript   z   F   z      \displaystyle{\mu_{F}(z)={\partial_{\overline{z}}F(z)\over\partial_{z}F(z)}.}     If F and G are diffeomorphisms of the disk, then         μ   G  ∘   F   -  1      ∘  F   =     F  z     F  z   ¯       μ  G   -   μ  F     1  -     μ  F   ¯    μ  G        .         subscript  μ    G   superscript  F    1      F        subscript  F  z    normal-¯   subscript  F  z          subscript  μ  G    subscript  μ  F      1     normal-¯   subscript  μ  F     subscript  μ  G         \displaystyle{\mu_{G\circ F^{-1}}\circ F={F_{z}\over\overline{F_{z}}}{\mu_{G}-%

So to prove that H f is quasiconformal it suffices to show that if f is any quasi-Möbius homeomorphism fixing 1, i and − i , with fixed c and d , then the quantities       Λ   (  f  )    =   |    g  b    (   -    a   -  1      a  1   ¯     )    |         normal-Λ  f        subscript  g  b        subscript  a    1     normal-¯   subscript  a  1          \displaystyle{\Lambda(f)=\left|g_{b}\left(-{a_{-1}\over\overline{a_{1}}}\right%
 )\right|}     have an upper bound strictly less than one.  On the other hand if f is quasi-Möbius and fixes 1, i and − i , then f satisfies a Hölder continuity condition:        |    f   (  z  )    -   f   (  w  )     |   ≤   C    |   z  -  w   |   d     ,            f  z     f  w       C   superscript      z  w    d      \displaystyle{|f(z)-f(w)|\leq C|z-w|^{d},}     for another positive constant C independent of f . The same is true for the f −1 's. But then the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem implies these homeomorphisms form a compact subset in C( T ). The non-linear functional Λ is continuous on this subset and therefore attains its upper bound at some f 0 . On the other hand Λ( f 0 ) \displaystyle{|(w,i; z,-i)| \le 16|z-w|,\,\,\, |(f(w),i; f(z),-i)| \ge |f(z)-f(w)|/8,}   so there is a corresponding Hölder estimate.    If | z - w | ≥ 1/8, the Hölder estimate is trivial since | f ( z ) - f ( w )| ≤ 2.    If | z - 1| ≥ 1/4, then | w - ζ| ≥ 1/4 for ζ = i or − i . But then            |   (  z  ,  ζ  ;  w  ,  1  )   |   ≤   8   |   z  -  w   |     ,    |   (   f   (  z  )    ,  ζ  ;   f   (  w  )    ,  1  )   |   ≥    |    f   (  z  )    -   f   (  w  )     |   /  8     ,     formulae-sequence       z  ζ  w  1      8      z  w             f  z   ζ    f  w   1            f  z     f  w     8      \displaystyle{|(z,\zeta;w,1)|\leq 8|z-w|,\,\,\,|(f(z),\zeta;f(w),1)|\geq|f(z)-%
 f(w)|/8,}         so there is a corresponding Hölder estimate.   References         "  Category:Complex analysis
