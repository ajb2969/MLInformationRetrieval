Zaslavskii map

 The Zaslavskii map is a discrete-time dynamical system introduced by George M. Zaslavsky. It is an example of a dynamical system that exhibits chaotic behavior. The Zaslavskii map takes a point (
 
 
 
 ) in the plane and maps it to a new point:






and



where mod is the modulo operator with real arguments. The map depends on four constants ν, μ, ε and r. Russel (1980) gives a Hausdorff dimension of 1.39 but Grassberger (1983) questions this value based on their difficulties measuring the correlation dimension.
