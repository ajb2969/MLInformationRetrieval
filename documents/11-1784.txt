   Window operator      Window operator   In modal logic , the window operator    △   normal-△   \triangle   is a modal operator with the following semantic definition:        M  ,  w   ⊧   △  ϕ    ⇔     ∀  u   ,  M  ,  u   ⊧  ϕ  ⇒   R  w  u       iff   models   M  w     normal-△  ϕ       models    for-all  u   M  u   ϕ    normal-⇒      R  w  u       M,w\models\triangle\phi\iff\forall u,M,u\models\phi\Rightarrow Rwu     for    M  =   (  W  ,  R  ,  f  )       M   W  R  f     M=(W,R,f)   a Kripke model and     w  ,  u   ∈  W       w  u   W    w,u\in W   . Informally, it says that w "sees" every φ -world (or every φ-world is seen by w ). This operator is not definable in the basic modal logic (i.e. some propositional non-modal language together with a single primitive "necessity" (universal) operator, often denoted by '   □   normal-□   \square   ', or its existential dual, often denoted by '   ◇   normal-◇   \Diamond   '). Notice that its truth condition is the converse of the truth condition for the standard "necessity" operator.  For references to some of its applications, see the References section.
