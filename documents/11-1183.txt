   1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase      1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + 1,2-diacylglycerol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 3-D-glucosyl-1,2-diacylglycerol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and 1,2-diacylglycerol , whereas its two products are UDP and 3-D-glucosyl-1,2-diacylglycerol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:1,2-diacylglycerol 3-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include UDP-glucose:diacylglycerol glucosyltransferase , UDP-glucose:1,2-diacylglycerol glucosyltransferase , uridine diphosphoglucose-diacylglycerol glucosyltransferase , and UDP-glucose-diacylglycerol glucosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in glycerolipid metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
