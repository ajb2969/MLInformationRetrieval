   Dimethylamine-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase      Dimethylamine-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase   Dimethylamine-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase (, mtbB (gene) , dimethylamine methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name dimethylamine:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide Co-methyltransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   dimethylamine + [Co(I) dimethylamine-specific corrinoid protein]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   [methyl-Co(III) dimethylamine-specific corrinoid protein] + methylamine    This enzyme is involved in methanogenesis from dimethylamine.
