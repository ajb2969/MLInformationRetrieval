Dimethylamine-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase

Dimethylamine-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase (, mtbB (gene), dimethylamine methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name dimethylamine:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide Co-methyltransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

dimethylamine + [Co(I) dimethylamine-specific corrinoid protein] 
 
 
 
  [methyl-Co(III) dimethylamine-specific corrinoid protein] + methylamine


This enzyme is involved in methanogenesis from dimethylamine.
