143 (one hundred [and] forty-three) is the natural number following 142 and preceding 144.
In mathematics
143 is the sum of seven consecutive primes (11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31). But this number is never the sum of an integer and its base 10 digits, making it a self number.
Every positive integer is the sum of at most 143 seventh powers (see Waring's problem).
