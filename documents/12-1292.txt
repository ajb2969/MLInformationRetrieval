Construction  It is created by a Wythoff construction upon a set of 8 hyperplane mirrors in 7-dimensional space.  The facet information can be extracted from its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram .      Removing a node on the end of one of the 3-length branch leaves the 1 32 , its only facet type.      The vertex figure is determined by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes the trirectified 7-simplex , 0 33 .      The edge figure is determined by removing the ringed nodes of the vertex figure and ringing the neighboring node. This makes the tetrahedral duoprism , {3,3}×{3,3}.      Kissing number  Each vertex of this polytope corresponds to the center of a 6-sphere in a moderately dense sphere packing , in which each sphere is tangent to 70 others; the best known for 7 dimensions (the kissing number ) is 126.  Geometric folding  The     E  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  E   7    {\tilde{E}}_{7}   group is related to the     F  ~   4     subscript   normal-~  F   4    {\tilde{F}}_{4}   by a geometric folding , so this honeycomb can be projected into the 4-dimensional demitesseractic honeycomb .           E  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  E   7    {\tilde{E}}_{7}           F  ~   4     subscript   normal-~  F   4    {\tilde{F}}_{4}              {3,3 3,3 }   {3,3,4,3}     E 7 * lattice       E  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  E   7    {\tilde{E}}_{7}   contains     A  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  A   7    {\tilde{A}}_{7}   as a subgroup of index 144. 1 Both     E  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  E   7    {\tilde{E}}_{7}   and     A  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  A   7    {\tilde{A}}_{7}   can be seen as affine extension from    A  7     subscript  A  7    A_{7}   from different nodes:  The E 7 * lattice (also called E 7 2 ) 2 has double the symmetry, represented by 3,3 3,3 . The Voronoi cell of the E 7 * lattice is the 1 32 polytope, and voronoi tessellation the 1 33 honeycomb . 3 The E 7 * lattice is constructed by 2 copies of the E 7 lattice vertices, one from each long branch of the Coxeter diagram, and can be constructed as the union of four A 7 * lattices, also called A 7 4 :    ∪  =  ∪  ∪  ∪  = dual of .    Related polytopes and honeycombs  The 1 33 is fourth in a dimensional series of uniform polytopes and honeycombs, expressed by Coxeter as 1 3k series. The final is a noncompact hyperbolic honeycomb, 1 34 .  Rectified 1_33 honeycomb  The rectified 1 33 or 0 331 , Coxeter diagram  has facets  and , and vertex figure .
