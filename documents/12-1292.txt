Properties



In 7-dimensional geometry, 133 is a uniform honeycomb, also given by Schläfli symbol {3,33,3}, and is composed of 132''' facets.
Construction
It is created by a Wythoff construction upon a set of 8 hyperplane mirrors in 7-dimensional space.
The facet information can be extracted from its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram.




Removing a node on the end of one of the 3-length branch leaves the 132, its only facet type.




The vertex figure is determined by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes the trirectified 7-simplex, 033.




The edge figure is determined by removing the ringed nodes of the vertex figure and ringing the neighboring node. This makes the tetrahedral duoprism, {3,3}×{3,3}.




Kissing number
Each vertex of this polytope corresponds to the center of a 6-sphere in a moderately dense sphere packing, in which each sphere is tangent to 70 others; the best known for 7 dimensions (the kissing number) is 126.
Geometric folding
The 
 
 
 
  group is related to the 
 
 
 
  by a geometric folding, so this honeycomb can be projected into the 4-dimensional demitesseractic honeycomb.

The E7* lattice (also called E72)2 has double the symmetry, represented by 3,33,3. The Voronoi cell of the E7* lattice is the 132 polytope, and voronoi tessellation the 133 honeycomb.3 The E7* lattice is constructed by 2 copies of the E7 lattice vertices, one from each long branch of the Coxeter diagram, and can be constructed as the union of four A7* lattices, also called A74:


∪  =  ∪  ∪  ∪  = dual of .
