   SAIDI      SAIDI   The System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) 1 is commonly used as a reliability indicator by electric power utilities. SAIDI is the average outage duration for each customer served, and is calculated as:      SAIDI  =     ∑    U  i    N  i       N  T        SAIDI         subscript  U  i    subscript  N  i      subscript  N  T      \mbox{SAIDI}=\frac{\sum{U_{i}N_{i}}}{N_{T}}     where    N  i     subscript  N  i    N_{i}   is the number of customers and    U  i     subscript  U  i    U_{i}   is the annual outage time for location   i   i   i   , and    N  T     subscript  N  T    N_{T}   is the total number of customers served. In other words,      SAIDI  =   sum of all customer interruption durations  total number of customers served       SAIDI    sum of all customer interruption durations  total number of customers served     \mbox{SAIDI}=\frac{\mbox{sum of all customer interruption durations}}{\mbox{%
 total number of customers served}}     SAIDI is measured in units of time, often minutes or hours. It is usually measured over the course of a year, and according to IEEE Standard 1366-1998 the median value for North American utilities is approximately 1.50 hours.
