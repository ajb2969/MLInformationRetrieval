   Phosphoglycerate phosphatase      Phosphoglycerate phosphatase   In enzymology , a phosphoglycerate phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-glycerate 2-phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glycerate + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-glycerate 2-phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are D-glycerate and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glycerate-2-phosphate phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include D-2-phosphoglycerate phosphatase , and glycerophosphate phosphatase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
