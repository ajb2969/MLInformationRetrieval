<p>A <strong>radioisotope thermoelectric generator</strong> (<strong>RTG</strong>, <strong>RITEG</strong>) is an <a href="electrical_generator" title="wikilink">electrical generator</a> that uses an array of <a href="thermocouple" title="wikilink">thermocouples</a> to convert the <a href="Decay_heat" title="wikilink">heat released by the decay</a> of a suitable <a href="radioactivity" title="wikilink">radioactive</a> material into <a class="uri" href="electricity" title="wikilink">electricity</a> by the <a href="Seebeck_effect" title="wikilink">Seebeck effect</a>. An RTG has no moving parts.</p>

<p>RTGs have been used as power sources in <a href="satellite" title="wikilink">satellites</a>, <a href="space_probe" title="wikilink">space probes</a>, and unmanned remote facilities such as a series of <a class="uri" href="lighthouses" title="wikilink">lighthouses</a> built by the former Soviet Union inside the <a href="Arctic_Circle" title="wikilink">Arctic Circle</a>. RTGs are usually the most desirable power source for unmaintained situations that need a few hundred <a href="watt" title="wikilink">watts</a> (or less) of power for durations too long for <a href="fuel_cell" title="wikilink">fuel cells</a>, batteries, or generators to provide economically, and in places where <a href="solar_cell" title="wikilink">solar cells</a> are not practical. Safe use of RTGs requires containment of the <a class="uri" href="radioisotopes" title="wikilink">radioisotopes</a> long after the productive life of the unit.</p>

<p>In the same brief letter where he introduced the communications satellite, <a href="Arthur_C._Clarke" title="wikilink">Arthur C. Clarke</a> suggested that, with respect to spacecraft, "the operating period might be indefinitely prolonged by the use of thermocouples."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>RTGs were developed in the US during the late 1950s by <a href="Mound_Laboratories" title="wikilink">Mound Laboratories</a> in <a href="Miamisburg,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Miamisburg, Ohio</a> under contract with the <a href="United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission" title="wikilink">United States Atomic Energy Commission</a>. The project was led by Dr. Bertram C. Blanke.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>The first RTG launched into space by the United States was <a href="Systems_for_Nuclear_Auxiliary_Power" title="wikilink">SNAP 3</a> in 1961, aboard the Navy <a href="Transit_(satellite)" title="wikilink">Transit 4A spacecraft</a>. One of the first terrestrial uses of RTGs was in 1966 by the US Navy at uninhabited <a href="Fairway_Rock#The_Radioisotope_Thermoelectric_Generator" title="wikilink">Fairway Rock</a> in Alaska. RTGs were used at that site until 1995.</p>

<p>A common RTG application is spacecraft power supply. <a href="Systems_for_Nuclear_Auxiliary_Power" title="wikilink">Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power</a> (SNAP) units were used for probes that traveled far from the Sun rendering <a href="Photovoltaic_module" title="wikilink">solar panels</a> impractical. As such, they were used with <a href="Pioneer_10" title="wikilink">Pioneer 10</a>, <a href="Pioneer_11" title="wikilink">Pioneer 11</a>, <a href="Voyager_1" title="wikilink">Voyager 1</a>, <a href="Voyager_2" title="wikilink">Voyager 2</a>, <a href="Galileo_probe" title="wikilink">Galileo</a>, <a href="Ulysses_probe" title="wikilink">Ulysses</a>, <a href="Cassini-Huygens" title="wikilink">Cassini</a>, <a href="New_Horizons" title="wikilink">New Horizons</a> and the <a href="Mars_Science_Laboratory#Power_source" title="wikilink">Mars Science Laboratory</a>. RTGs were used to power the two <a href="Viking_program" title="wikilink">Viking</a> landers and for the scientific experiments left on the Moon by the crews of <a href="Apollo_program" title="wikilink">Apollo</a> <a href="Apollo_12" title="wikilink">12</a> through <a href="Apollo_17" title="wikilink">17</a> (SNAP 27s). Because the <a href="Apollo_13#Spacecraft_location" title="wikilink">Apollo 13</a> moon landing was aborted, its RTG rests in the <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">South Pacific ocean</a>, in the vicinity of the <a href="Tonga_Trench" title="wikilink">Tonga Trench</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> RTGs were also used for the <a href="Nimbus_program" title="wikilink">Nimbus</a>, <a href="Transit_(satellite)" title="wikilink">Transit</a> and <a href="Lincoln_Experimental_Satellite" title="wikilink">LES</a> satellites. By comparison, only a few space vehicles have been launched using full-fledged <a href="nuclear_reactor" title="wikilink">nuclear reactors</a>: the Soviet <a href="US-A" title="wikilink">RORSAT</a> series and the American <a class="uri" href="SNAP-10A" title="wikilink">SNAP-10A</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to spacecraft, the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> constructed many unmanned lighthouses and navigation beacons powered by RTGs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Powered by <a href="Strontium-90" title="wikilink">strontium-90 (<sup>90</sup>Sr)</a>, they are very reliable and provide a steady source of power. Critics argue that they could cause environmental and security problems as leakage or theft of the radioactive material could pass unnoticed for years, particularly as the locations of some of these lighthouses are no longer known due to poor record keeping. In one instance, the radioactive compartments were opened by a thief.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In another case, three woodsmen in <a href="Georgia_(country)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a> came across two ceramic RTG heat sources that had been stripped of their shielding. Two of the three were later hospitalized with severe radiation burns after carrying the sources on their backs. The units were eventually recovered and isolated.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>There are approximately 1,000 such RTGs in Russia. All of them have long exhausted their 10-year engineered life spans. They are likely no longer functional, and may be in need of dismantling. Some of them have become the prey of metal hunters, who strip the RTGs' metal casings, regardless of the risk of radioactive contamination.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">United States Air Force</a> uses RTGs to power remote sensing stations for <em>Top-ROCC</em> and <em><a href="SEEK_IGLOO" title="wikilink">SEEK IGLOO</a></em> radar systems predominantly located in <a class="uri" href="Alaska" title="wikilink">Alaska</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>In the past, small "plutonium cells" (very small <sup>238</sup>Pu-powered RTGs) were used in implanted <a href="Artificial_pacemaker" title="wikilink">heart pacemakers</a> to ensure a very long "battery life".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> , about 90 were still in use.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>The design of an RTG is simple by the standards of <a href="nuclear_technology" title="wikilink">nuclear technology</a>: the main component is a sturdy container of a radioactive material (the fuel). <a href="Thermocouple" title="wikilink">Thermocouples</a> are placed in the walls of the container, with the outer end of each thermocouple connected to a <a href="heat_sink" title="wikilink">heat sink</a>. Radioactive decay of the fuel produces heat which flows through the thermocouples to the heat sink, generating electricity in the process.</p>

<p>A thermocouple is a <a href="thermoelectricity" title="wikilink">thermoelectric</a> device that converts <a href="thermal_energy" title="wikilink">thermal energy</a> directly into <a href="electrical_energy" title="wikilink">electrical energy</a> using the <a href="Peltier-Seebeck_effect" title="wikilink">Seebeck effect</a>. It is made of two kinds of metal (or semiconductors) that can both conduct electricity. They are connected to each other in a closed loop. If the two junctions are at different <a href="temperature" title="wikilink">temperatures</a>, an electric current will flow in the loop.</p>
<h2 id="fuels">Fuels</h2>

<p> </p>
<h3 id="criteria-for-selection-of-isotopes">Criteria for selection of isotopes</h3>

<p>The radioactive material used in RTGs must have several characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Its <a class="uri" href="half-life" title="wikilink">half-life</a> must be long enough so that it will release energy at a relatively constant rate for a reasonable amount of time. The amount of energy released per time (<a href="Power_(physics)" title="wikilink">power</a>) of a given quantity is inversely proportional to half-life. An isotope with twice the half-life and the same energy per decay will release power at half the rate per <a href="Mole_(unit)" title="wikilink">mole</a>. Typical half-lives for <a class="uri" href="radioisotopes" title="wikilink">radioisotopes</a> used in RTGs are therefore several decades, although <a class="uri" href="isotopes" title="wikilink">isotopes</a> with shorter half-lives could be used for specialized applications.</li>
<li>For spaceflight use, the fuel must produce a large amount of power per <a class="uri" href="mass" title="wikilink">mass</a> and <a class="uri" href="volume" title="wikilink">volume</a> (<a class="uri" href="density" title="wikilink">density</a>). Density and weight are not as important for terrestrial use, unless there are size restrictions. The <a href="decay_energy" title="wikilink">decay energy</a> can be calculated if the energy of radioactive radiation or the mass loss before and after radioactive decay is known. Energy release per decay is proportional to power production per <a href="Mole_(unit)" title="wikilink">mole</a>. <a href="Alpha_decay" title="wikilink">Alpha decays</a> in general release about 10 times as much energy as the <a href="beta_decay" title="wikilink">beta decay</a> of strontium-90 or caesium-137.</li>
<li>Radiation must be of a type easily absorbed and transformed into thermal radiation, preferably <a href="Alpha_particle" title="wikilink">alpha radiation</a>. <a href="Beta_particle" title="wikilink">Beta radiation</a> can emit considerable <a href="gamma_radiation" title="wikilink">gamma</a>/<a href="X-rays" title="wikilink">X-ray radiation</a> through <a class="uri" href="bremsstrahlung" title="wikilink">bremsstrahlung</a> secondary radiation production and therefore requires heavy shielding. Isotopes must not produce significant amounts of gamma, <a href="neutron_radiation" title="wikilink">neutron radiation</a> or penetrating radiation in general through other <a href="decay_mode" title="wikilink">decay modes</a> or <a href="decay_chain" title="wikilink">decay chain</a> products.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first two criteria limit the number of possible fuels to fewer than 30 atomic isotopes<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> within the entire <a href="table_of_nuclides" title="wikilink">table of nuclides</a>. <a class="uri" href="Plutonium-238" title="wikilink">Plutonium-238</a>, <a href="Curium" title="wikilink">curium-244</a> and <a class="uri" href="strontium-90" title="wikilink">strontium-90</a> are the most often cited candidate isotopes, but other isotopes such as <a class="uri" href="polonium-210" title="wikilink">polonium-210</a>, <a class="uri" href="promethium-147" title="wikilink">promethium-147</a>, <a class="uri" href="caesium-137" title="wikilink">caesium-137</a>, <a class="uri" href="cerium" title="wikilink">cerium</a>-144, <a class="uri" href="ruthenium-106" title="wikilink">ruthenium-106</a>, <a class="uri" href="cobalt-60" title="wikilink">cobalt-60</a>, <a class="uri" href="curium" title="wikilink">curium</a>-242, <a class="uri" href="americium" title="wikilink">americium</a>-241 and <a class="uri" href="thulium" title="wikilink">thulium</a> isotopes have also been studied.</p>
<h4 id="pu"><sup>238</sup>Pu</h4>

<p><a class="uri" href="Plutonium-238" title="wikilink">Plutonium-238</a> has a half-life of 87.7 years, reasonable power density of 0.54 watts per gram, and exceptionally low gamma and neutron radiation levels. <sup>238</sup>Pu has the lowest shielding requirements; Only three candidate isotopes meet the last criterion (not all are listed above) and need less than 25 mm of <a href="lead_shielding" title="wikilink">lead shielding</a> to block the radiation. <sup>238</sup>Pu (the best of these three) needs less than 2.5 mm, and in many cases, no shielding is needed in a <sup>238</sup>Pu RTG, as the casing itself is adequate. <sup>238</sup>Pu has become the most widely used fuel for RTGs, in the form of <a href="plutonium(IV)_oxide" title="wikilink">plutonium(IV) oxide</a> (PuO<sub>2</sub>). Unlike the latter RTG fuels, <sup>238</sup>Pu must be specifically synthesized and is not abundant as a nuclear waste product. At present only <a class="uri" href="Russia" title="wikilink">Russia</a> has maintained consistent <sup>238</sup>Pu production, while the <a class="uri" href="USA" title="wikilink">USA</a> restarted production at ~1.5 kg a year in 2013 after a ~25-year hiatus. At present these are the only countries with declared production of <sup>238</sup>Pu in quantities useful for RTGs. <sup>238</sup>Pu is produced at typically 85% purity and its purity decreases over time.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="sr"><sup>90</sup>Sr</h4>

<p><a class="uri" href="Strontium-90" title="wikilink">Strontium-90</a> has been used by the Soviet Union in terrestrial RTGs. <sup>90</sup>Sr decays by β emission, with minor γ emission. While its half life of 28.8 years is much shorter than that of <sup>238</sup>Pu, it also has a much lower decay energy; its power density is only 0.46 watts per gram. Because the energy output is lower it reaches lower temperatures than <sup>238</sup>Pu, which results in lower RTG efficiency. <sup>90</sup>Sr is a high yield waste product of nuclear fission and is available in large quantities at a low price.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="po"><sup>210</sup>Po</h4>

<p>Some prototype RTGs, first built in 1958 by the US Atomic Energy Commission, have used <a class="uri" href="polonium-210" title="wikilink">polonium-210</a>. This isotope provides phenomenal power density (pure <sup>210</sup>Po emits <a href="Decay_energy" title="wikilink">140 W</a>/g) because of its high <a href="Radioactive_decay#Radioactive_decay_rates" title="wikilink">decay rate</a>, but has limited use because of its very short half-life of 138 days. A half-gram sample of <sup>210</sup>Po reaches temperatures of over .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="am"><sup>241</sup>Am</h4>

<p><a class="uri" href="Americium-241" title="wikilink">Americium-241</a> is a potential candidate isotope with a longer half-life than <sup>238</sup>Pu: <sup>241</sup>Am has a half-life of 432 years and could hypothetically power a device for centuries. However, the power density of <sup>241</sup>Am is only 1/4 that of <sup>238</sup>Pu, and <sup>241</sup>Am produces more penetrating radiation through decay chain products than <sup>238</sup>Pu and needs more shielding. Even so, its shielding requirements in an RTG are the second lowest of all possible isotopes: only <sup>238</sup>Pu requires less. With a current global shortage<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> of <sup>238</sup>Pu, <sup>241</sup>Am is being studied as RTG fuel by the <a class="uri" href="ESA" title="wikilink">ESA</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <sup>241</sup>Am advantage over <sup>238</sup>Pu is that it is produced as nuclear waste and is nearly isotopically pure. Prototype designs of <sup>241</sup>Am RTGs expect 2-2.2 W<sub>e</sub>/kg for 5-50 W<sub>e</sub> RTGs design, putting <sup>241</sup>Am RTGs at parity with <sup>238</sup>Pu RTGs within that power range.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="life-span">Life span</h2>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption> 300px|right|<a href="Strontium-90" title="wikilink"><sup>90</sup>Sr</a>-powered Soviet RTGs in dilapidated condition.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Most RTGs use <sup>238</sup>Pu, which decays with a half-life of 87.7 years. RTGs using this material will therefore diminish in power output by a factor of 1−0.5<sup>1/87.74</sup>, or 0.787%, per year.</p>

<p>One example is the RTG used by the <a href="Voyager_probes" title="wikilink">Voyager probes</a>—In the year 2000, 23 years after production, the radioactive material inside the RTG had decreased in power by 16.6%, i.e. providing 83.4% of its initial output; starting with a capacity of 470 W, after this length of time it would have a capacity of only 392 W. A related (and unexpected) loss of power in the Voyager RTGs is the degrading properties of the bi-metallic thermocouples used to convert <a href="thermal_energy" title="wikilink">thermal energy</a> into <a href="electrical_energy" title="wikilink">electrical energy</a>, the RTGs were working at about 67% of their total original capacity instead of the expected 83.4%. By the beginning of 2001, the power generated by the Voyager RTGs had dropped to 315 W for Voyager 1 and to 319 W for Voyager 2.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h2>

<p>RTGs use <a href="thermocouple" title="wikilink">thermocouples</a> to convert heat from the radioactive material into electricity. Thermocouples, though very reliable and long-lasting, are very inefficient; efficiencies above 10% have never been achieved and most RTGs have efficiencies between 3–7%. Thermoelectric materials in space missions to date have included silicon–germanium alloys, lead telluride and tellurides of antimony, germanium and silver (TAGS). Studies have been done on improving efficiency by using other technologies to generate electricity from heat. Achieving higher efficiency would mean less radioactive fuel is needed to produce the same amount of power, and therefore a lighter overall weight for the generator. This is a critically important factor in spaceflight launch cost considerations.</p>

<p>A <a href="thermionic_converter" title="wikilink">thermionic converter</a>—an energy conversion device which relies on the principle of <a class="uri" href="thermionic" title="wikilink">thermionic</a> emission—can achieve efficiencies between 10–20%, but requires higher temperatures than those at which standard RTGs run. Some prototype <sup>210</sup>Po RTGs have used thermionics, and potentially other extremely radioactive isotopes could also provide power by this means, but short half-lives make these unfeasible. Several space-bound nuclear reactors have used thermionics, but nuclear reactors are usually too heavy to use on most space probes.</p>

<p><a href="Thermophotovoltaic_cell" title="wikilink">Thermophotovoltaic cells</a> work by the same principles as a <a href="photovoltaic_cell" title="wikilink">photovoltaic cell</a>, except that they convert <a class="uri" href="infrared" title="wikilink">infrared</a> light emitted by a hot surface rather than visible light into electricity. Thermophotovoltaic cells have an efficiency slightly higher than thermocouples and can be overlaid on top of thermocouples, potentially doubling efficiency. Systems with radioisotope generators simulated by electric heaters have demonstrated efficiencies of 20%,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> but have not been tested with actual radioisotopes. Some theoretical thermophotovoltaic cell designs have efficiencies up to 30%, but these have yet to be built or confirmed. Thermophotovoltaic cells and silicon thermocouples degrade faster than metal thermocouples, especially in the presence of ionizing radiation.</p>

<p>Dynamic generators can provide power at more than 4 times the conversion efficiency of RTGs. NASA and DOE have been developing a next-generation radioisotope-fueled power source called the <a href="Stirling_Radioisotope_Generator" title="wikilink">Stirling Radioisotope Generator</a> (SRG) that uses free-piston <a href="Stirling_engine" title="wikilink">Stirling engines</a> coupled to linear alternators to convert heat to electricity. SRG prototypes demonstrated an average efficiency of 23%. Greater efficiency can be achieved by increasing the temperature ratio between the hot and cold ends of the generator. The use of non-contacting moving parts, non-degrading <a href="Flexure_bearing" title="wikilink">flexural bearings</a>, and a lubrication-free and hermetically sealed environment have, in test units, demonstrated no appreciable degradation over years of operation. Experimental results demonstrate that an SRG could continue running for decades without maintenance. Vibration can be eliminated as a concern by implementation of dynamic balancing or use of dual-opposed piston movement. Potential applications of a Stirling radioisotope power system include exploration and science missions to deep-space, Mars, and the Moon.</p>

<p>The increased efficiency of the SRG may be demonstrated by a theoretical comparison of thermodynamic properties, as follows. These calculations are simplified and do not account for the decay of thermal power input due to the long half-life of the radioisotopes used in these generators. The assumptions for this analysis include that both systems are operating at steady state under the conditions observed in experimental procedures (see table below for values used). Both generators can be simplified to heat engines to be able to compare their current efficiencies to their corresponding Carnot efficiencies. The system is assumed to be the components, apart from the heat source and heat sink.,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="radioactive-contamination">Radioactive contamination</h3>

<p>RTGs pose a risk of <a href="radioactive_contamination" title="wikilink">radioactive contamination</a>: if the container holding the fuel leaks, the radioactive material may contaminate the environment.</p>

<p>For spacecraft, the main concern is that if an accident were to occur during launch or a subsequent passage of a spacecraft close to Earth, harmful material could be released into the atmosphere; therefore their use in spacecraft and elsewhere has attracted controversy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>However, this event is not considered likely with current RTG cask designs. For instance, the environmental impact study for the Cassini–Huygens probe launched in 1997 estimated the probability of contamination accidents at various stages in the mission. The probability of an accident occurring which caused radioactive release from one or more of its 3 RTGs (or from its 129 <a href="radioisotope_heater_unit" title="wikilink">radioisotope heater units</a>) during the first 3.5 minutes following launch was estimated at 1 in 1,400; the chances of a release later in the ascent into orbit were 1 in 476; after that the likelihood of an accidental release fell off sharply to less than 1 in a million.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> If an accident which had the potential to cause contamination occurred during the launch phases (such as the spacecraft failing to reach orbit), the probability of contamination actually being caused by the RTGs was estimated at about 1 in 10.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In any event, the launch was successful and Cassini–Huygens reached <a class="uri" href="Saturn" title="wikilink">Saturn</a>.</p>

<p>The <a class="uri" href="plutonium-238" title="wikilink">plutonium-238</a> used in these RTGs has a <a class="uri" href="half-life" title="wikilink">half-life</a> of 87.74 years, in contrast to the 24,110 year half-life of <a class="uri" href="plutonium-239" title="wikilink">plutonium-239</a> used in <a href="nuclear_weapons" title="wikilink">nuclear weapons</a> and <a href="Nuclear_reactor" title="wikilink">reactors</a>. A consequence of the shorter half-life is that plutonium-238 is about 275 times more radioactive than plutonium-239 (i.e. /<a href="gram" title="wikilink">g</a> compared to /g<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>). For instance, 3.6 <a href="kilogram" title="wikilink">kg</a> of plutonium-238 undergoes the same number of radioactive decays per second as 1 tonne of plutonium-239. Since the morbidity of the two isotopes in terms of absorbed radioactivity is almost exactly the same,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> plutonium-238 is around 275 times more toxic by weight than plutonium-239.</p>

<p>The alpha radiation emitted by either isotope will not penetrate the skin, but it can irradiate internal organs if plutonium is inhaled or ingested. Particularly at risk is the <a class="uri" href="skeleton" title="wikilink">skeleton</a>, the surface of which is likely to absorb the isotope, and the <a class="uri" href="liver" title="wikilink">liver</a>, where the isotope will collect and become concentrated.</p>

<p>There have been several known accidents involving RTG-powered spacecraft:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first one was a launch failure on 21 April 1964 in which the U.S. <a href="Transit_(satellite)" title="wikilink">Transit-5BN-3</a> navigation satellite failed to achieve orbit and burned up on re-entry north of <a class="uri" href="Madagascar" title="wikilink">Madagascar</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The  plutonium metal fuel in its <a href="Systems_Nuclear_Auxiliary_Power_Program" title="wikilink">SNAP</a>-9a RTG was injected into the atmosphere over the Southern Hemisphere where it burned up, and traces of plutonium-238 were detected in the area a few months later.</li>
<li>The second was the Nimbus B-1 weather satellite whose launch vehicle was deliberately destroyed shortly after launch on 21 May 1968 because of erratic trajectory. Launched from the <a href="Vandenberg_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Vandenberg Air Force Base</a>, its SNAP-19 RTG containing relatively inert <a href="plutonium_dioxide" title="wikilink">plutonium dioxide</a> was recovered intact from the seabed in the <a href="Santa_Barbara_Channel" title="wikilink">Santa Barbara Channel</a> five months later and no environmental contamination was detected.<ref></ref></li>
</ol>

<p></p>
<ol>
<li>In 1969 the launch of the first <a class="uri" href="Lunokhod" title="wikilink">Lunokhod</a> lunar rover mission failed, spreading <a href="polonium_210" title="wikilink">polonium 210</a> over a large area of Russia <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></li>
<li>The failure of the <a href="Apollo_13" title="wikilink">Apollo 13</a> mission in April 1970 meant that the <a href="Lunar_Module" title="wikilink">Lunar Module</a> reentered the atmosphere carrying an RTG and burned up over <a class="uri" href="Fiji" title="wikilink">Fiji</a>. It carried a SNAP-27 RTG containing  of plutonium dioxide which survived reentry into the Earth's atmosphere intact, as it was designed to do, the trajectory being arranged so that it would plunge into 6–9 kilometers of water in the <a href="Tonga_trench" title="wikilink">Tonga trench</a> in the <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Pacific Ocean</a>. The absence of plutonium-238 contamination in atmospheric and seawater sampling confirmed the assumption that the cask is intact on the seabed. The cask is expected to contain the fuel for at least 10 half-lives (i.e. 870 years). The US Department of Energy has conducted seawater tests and determined that the graphite casing, which was designed to withstand reentry, is stable and no release of plutonium should occur. Subsequent investigations have found no increase in the natural background radiation in the area. The Apollo 13 accident represents an extreme scenario because of the high re-entry velocities of the craft returning from <a href="Geospace" title="wikilink">cis-lunar space</a> (the region between Earth's atmosphere and the Moon). This accident has served to validate the design of later-generation RTGs as highly safe.</li>
<li><a href="Mars_96" title="wikilink">Mars 96</a> launched by Russia in 1996, but failed to leave Earth orbit, and re-entered the atmosphere a few hours later. The two RTGs onboard carried in total 200 g of plutonium and are assumed to have survived reentry as they were designed to do. They are thought to now lie somewhere in a northeast-southwest running oval 320 km long by 80 km wide which is centred 32 km east of <a class="uri" href="Iquique" title="wikilink">Iquique</a>, <a class="uri" href="Chile" title="wikilink">Chile</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></li>

<p>To minimize the risk of the radioactive material being released, the fuel is stored in individual modular units with their own heat shielding. They are surrounded by a layer of <a class="uri" href="iridium" title="wikilink">iridium</a> metal and encased in high-strength <a class="uri" href="graphite" title="wikilink">graphite</a> blocks. These two materials are corrosion- and heat-resistant. Surrounding the graphite blocks is an aeroshell, designed to protect the entire assembly against the heat of reentering the Earth's atmosphere. The plutonium fuel is also stored in a ceramic form that is heat-resistant, minimising the risk of vaporization and aerosolization.

<p>Many <a class="uri" href="Beta-M" title="wikilink">Beta-M</a> RTGs produced by the Soviet Union to power <a href="lighthouse" title="wikilink">lighthouses</a> and <a href="beacon" title="wikilink">beacons</a> have become <a href="orphan_source" title="wikilink">orphaned sources</a> of radiation. Several of these units have been illegally dismantled for scrap metal (resulting in the complete exposure of the <a class="uri" href="Sr-90" title="wikilink">Sr-90</a> source), fallen into the ocean, or have defective shielding due to poor design or physical damage. The <a href="US_Department_of_Defense" title="wikilink">US Department of Defense</a> cooperative threat reduction program has expressed concern that material from the Beta-M RTGs can be used by <a href="terrorist" title="wikilink">terrorists</a> to construct a <a href="dirty_bomb" title="wikilink">dirty bomb</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="nuclear-fission">Nuclear fission</h3>

<p>RTGs and <a href="nuclear_power" title="wikilink">nuclear power</a> reactors use very different nuclear reactions. Nuclear power reactors use controlled <a href="nuclear_fission" title="wikilink">nuclear fission</a> in a <a href="chain_reaction" title="wikilink">chain reaction</a>. The rate of the reaction can be controlled with neutron absorbers, so power can be varied with demand or shut off entirely for maintenance. However, care is needed to avoid uncontrolled operation at dangerously high power levels.</p>

<p>Chain reactions do not occur in RTGs, so heat is produced at an unchangeable, though steadily decreasing rate that depends only on the amount of fuel isotope and its half-life. An accidental power excursion is impossible. However, if a launch or re-entry accident occurs and the fuel is dispersed, the combined power output of the now <a class="uri" href="radionuclides" title="wikilink">radionuclides</a> set free does not drop. In an RTG, heat generation cannot be varied with demand or shut off when not needed. Therefore, auxiliary power supplies (such as rechargeable batteries) may be needed to meet peak demand, and adequate cooling must be provided at all times including the pre-launch and early flight phases of a space mission.</p>
<h2 id="subcritical-multiplicator-rtg">Subcritical multiplicator RTG</h2>

<p>Because of the shortage of plutonium-238, a new kind of RTG assisted by subcritical reactions has been proposed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In this kind of RTG, the alpha decay from the radioisotope is also used in alpha-neutron reactions with a suitable element such as <a class="uri" href="beryllium" title="wikilink">beryllium</a>. This way a long-lived <a href="neutron_source" title="wikilink">neutron source</a> is produced. Because the system is working with a criticality close to but less than 1, i.e. <a href="Nuclear_chain_reaction#Effective_neutron_multiplication_factor" title="wikilink">K<sub>eff</sub></a> 238Pu needed per mission. The idea was proposed to NASA in 2012 for the yearly NASA NSPIRE competition, which translated to Idaho National Laboratory at the Center for Space Nuclear Research (CSNR) in 2013 for studies of feasibility.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a>. However the essential are unmodified.</p>
<h2 id="rtg-for-interstellar-probes">RTG for interstellar probes</h2>

<p>RTG have been proposed for use on realistic interstellar precursor missions and <a href="interstellar_probe" title="wikilink">interstellar probes</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> An example of this is the <a href="Innovative_Interstellar_Explorer" title="wikilink">Innovative Interstellar Explorer</a> (2003–current) proposal from NASA.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> A RTG using <sup>241</sup>Am was proposed for this type of mission in 2002.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> This could support mission extensions up to 1000 years on the interstellar probe, because the power output would be more stable in the long-term than plutonium.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Other isotopes for RTG were also examined in the study, looking at traits such as watt/gram, half-life, and decay products.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> An interstellar probe proposal from 1999 suggested using three <a href="advanced_radioisotope_power_source" title="wikilink">advanced radioisotope power source</a> (ARPS).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>The RTG electricity can be used for powering scientific instruments and communication to Earth on the probes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> One mission proposed using the electricity to power <a href="ion_engines" title="wikilink">ion engines</a>, calling this method <a href="radioisotope_electric_propulsion" title="wikilink">radioisotope electric propulsion</a> (REP).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
