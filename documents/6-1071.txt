Quantum register

A quantum register (also known as a qregister) is the quantum mechanical analogue of a classical processor register.
A mathematical description of the contents of a quantum register is achieved by using a tensor product of qubit bra or ket vectors. For example, the state of an n qubit quantum register is described by an element 
 
 
 
  in the tensor product Hilbert space
