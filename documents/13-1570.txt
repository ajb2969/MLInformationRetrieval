   Year-on-Year Inflation-Indexed Swap      Year-on-Year Inflation-Indexed Swap   The Year-on-Year Inﬂation-Indexed Swap ( YYIIS ) ia a standard derivative product over Inflation rate . The underlying asset is a single Consumer price index ( CPI ).  It is called Swap because each year there is a swap of a ﬁxed amount against a ﬂoating amount. But in reality only a one way payment is made (ﬁxed amount - ﬂoating amount).  Detailed flows   Each year, at time    T  i     subscript  T  i    T_{i}     Party B pays Party A the ﬁxed amount    N   ϕ  i   K      N   subscript  ϕ  i   K    N{\phi_{i}}K     Party A pays Party B the ﬂoating amount    N   ψ  i    [     I   (   T  i   )     I   (   T   i  -  1    )     -  1   ]       N   subscript  ψ  i    delimited-[]        I   subscript  T  i      I   subscript  T    i  1      1      N{\psi_{i}}[\frac{I(T_{i})}{I(T_{i-1})}-1]       where:   K is the contract ﬁxed rate  N the contract nominal value  M the number of years corresponding to the deal maturity  i the number of years (0 < i <= M)      ϕ  i     subscript  ϕ  i    \phi_{i}    is the ﬁxed-leg year fractions for the interval [Ti−1, Ti]      ψ  i     subscript  ψ  i    \psi_{i}    is the ﬂoating-leg year fractions for the interval [Ti−1, Ti]      T  0     subscript  T  0    T_{0}    is the start date      T  i     subscript  T  i    T_{i}    is the time of the flow i      T  M     subscript  T  M    T_{M}    is the maturity date (end of the swap)      I   (   T  0   )       I   subscript  T  0     I(T_{0})    is the inflation at start date (time    T  0     subscript  T  0    T_{0}   )      I   (   T  i   )       I   subscript  T  i     I(T_{i})    is the inflation at time of the flow i (time    T  i     subscript  T  i    T_{i}   )      I   (   T  M   )       I   subscript  T  M     I(T_{M})    is the inflation at maturity date (time    T  M     subscript  T  M    T_{M}   )   See also   Zero-Coupon Inflation-Indexed Swap ( ZCIIS )   "  Category:Inflation  Category:Derivatives (finance)
