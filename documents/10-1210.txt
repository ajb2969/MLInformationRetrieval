   Glucose-fructose oxidoreductase      Glucose-fructose oxidoreductase   In enzymology , a glucose-fructose oxidoreductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-glucose + D-fructose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-gluconolactone + D-glucitol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-glucose and D-fructose , whereas its two products are D-gluconolactone and D-glucitol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glucose:D-fructose oxidoreductase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
