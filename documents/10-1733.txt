3-chloro-D-alanine dehydrochlorinase

In enzymology, a 3-chloro-D-alanine dehydrochlorinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-chloro-D-alanine + H2O 
 
 
 
  pyruvate + chloride + NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-chloro-D-alanine and H2O, whereas its 3 products are pyruvate, chloride, and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the class of carbon-halide lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-chloro-D-alanine chloride-lyase (deaminating; pyruvate-forming). Other names in common use include beta-chloro-D-alanine dehydrochlorinase, and 3-chloro-D-alanine chloride-lyase (deaminating). It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
