Phosphonoacetaldehyde reductase (NADH)

Phosphonoacetaldehyde reductase (NADH) (, PhpC) is an enzyme with system name 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate:NAD+ oxidoreductase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2-hydroxyethylphosphonate + NAD+

 
  phosphonoacetaldehyde + NADH + H+


The enzyme from Streptomyces viridochromogenes catalyses a step in the biosynthesis of phosphinothricin tripeptide, the reduction of phosphonoacetaldehyde to 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate.
