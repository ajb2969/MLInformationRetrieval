   Orsellinate decarboxylase      Orsellinate decarboxylase   In enzymology , an orsellinate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2,4-dihydroxy-6-methylbenzoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   orcinol + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2,4-dihydroxy-6-methylbenzoate , and two products , orcinol and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,4-dihydroxy-6-methylbenzoate carboxy-lyase (orcinol-forming) . This enzyme is also called orsellinate carboxy-lyase .
