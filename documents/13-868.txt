   Perspectivity      Perspectivity   In geometry and in its applications to drawing , a perspectivity is the formation of an image in a picture plane of a scene viewed from a fixed point.  Graphics  The science of graphical perspective uses perspectivities to make realistic images in proper proportion. According to Kirsti Andersen , the first author to describe perspectivity was Leon Alberti in his De Pictura (1435). 1 In English, Brook Taylor presented his Linear Perspective in 1715, where he explained "Perspective is the Art of drawing on a Plane the Appearances of any Figures, by the Rules of Geometry". 2 In a second book, New Principles of Linear Perspective (1719), Taylor wrote   When Lines drawn according to a certain Law from the several Parts of any Figure, cut a Plane, and by that Cutting or Intersection describe a figure on that Plane, that Figure so described is called the Projection of the other Figure. The Lines producing that Projection, taken all together, are called the System of Rays . And when those Rays all pass thro‚Äô one and same Point, they are called the Cone of Rays . And when that Point is consider‚Äôd as the Eye of a Spectator, that System of Rays is called the Optic Cone 3    Projective Geometry  (Figure)  A perspectivity:       A  B  C  D   ‚©û    A  ‚Ä≤    B  ‚Ä≤    C  ‚Ä≤    D  ‚Ä≤     ,     normal-‚©û    A  B  C  D      superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤    superscript  B  normal-‚Ä≤    superscript  C  normal-‚Ä≤    superscript  D  normal-‚Ä≤      ABCD\doublebarwedge A^{\prime}B^{\prime}C^{\prime}D^{\prime},      In projective geometry the points of a line are called a projective range , and the set of lines in a plane on a point is called a pencil .  Given two lines    ‚Ñì   normal-‚Ñì   \ell   and   m   m   m   in a plane and a point P of that plane on neither line, the bijective mapping between the points of the range of   ‚Ñì   normal-‚Ñì   \ell   and the range of   m   m   m   determined by the lines of the pencil on P is called a perspectivity (or more precisely, a central perspectivity with center P ). 4 A special symbol has been used to show that points X and Y are related by a perspectivity;     X  ‚©û  Y   .     normal-‚©û  X  Y    X\doublebarwedge Y.   In this notation, to show that the center of perspectivity is P , write      X     ‚©û  ùëÉ    Y   .      X   P  normal-‚©û   Y    X\ \overset{P}{\doublebarwedge}\ Y.   Using the language of functions, a central perspectivity with center P is a function     f  P   :    [  ‚Ñì  ]   ‚Ü¶   [  m  ]       normal-:   subscript  f  P    maps-to   delimited-[]  normal-‚Ñì    delimited-[]  m      f_{P}\colon[\ell]\mapsto[m]   (where the square brackets indicate the projective range of the line) defined by      f  P    (  X  )    =   Y  whenever  P   ‚àà   X  Y            subscript  f  P   X     Y  whenever  P          X  Y      f_{P}(X)=Y\text{ whenever }P\in XY   . 5 This map is an involution , that is,      f  P    (    f  P    (  X  )    )    =   X  for all  X   ‚àà   [  ‚Ñì  ]            subscript  f  P      subscript  f  P   X      X  for all  X         delimited-[]  normal-‚Ñì      f_{P}(f_{P}(X))=X\text{ for all }X\in[\ell]   .  The existence of a perspectivity means that corresponding points are in perspective . The dual concept, axial perspectivity , is the correspondence between the lines of two pencils determined by a projective range.  Projectivity  The composition of two perspectivities is, in general, not a perspectivity. A perspectivity or a composition of two or more perspectivities is called a projectivity ( projective transformation , projective collineation and homography are synonyms ).  There are several results concerning projectivities and perspectivities which hold in any pappian projective plane: 6  Theorem: Any projectivity between two distinct projective ranges can be written as the composition of no more than two perspectivities.  Theorem: Any projectivity from a projective range to itself can be written as the composition of three perspectivities.  Theorem: A projectivity between two distinct projective ranges which fixes a point is a perspectivity.  Higher-dimensional perspectivities  The bijective correspondence between points on two lines in a plane determined by a point of that plane not on either line has higher-dimensional analogues which will also be called perspectivities.  Let S m and T m be two distinct m -dimensional projective spaces contained in an n -dimensional projective space R n . Let P n - m -1 be an ( n - m -1) - dimensional subspace of R n with no points in common with either S m or T m . For each point X of S m , the space L spanned by X and P n - m -1 meets T m in a point Y = f P ( X ). This correspondence f P is also called a perspectivity. 7 The central perspectivity described above is the case with n = 2 and m = 1.  Perspective collineations  Let S 2 and T 2 be two distinct projective planes in a projective 3-space R 3 . With O and O * being points of R 3 in neither plane, use the construction of the last section to project S 2 onto T 2 by the perspectivity with center O followed by the projection of T 2 back onto S 2 with the perspectivity with center O *. This composition is a bijective map of the points of S 2 onto itself which preserves collinear points and is called a perspective collineation ( central collineation in more modern terminology). 8 Let œÜ be a perspective collineation of S 2 . Each point of the line of intersection of S 2 and T 2 will be fixed by œÜ and this line is called the axis of œÜ. Let point P be the intersection of line OO * with the plane S 2 . P is also fixed by œÜ and every line of S 2 that passes through P is stabilized by œÜ (fixed, but not necessarily pointwise fixed). P is called the center of œÜ. The restriction of œÜ to any line of S 2 not passing through P is the central perspectivity in S 2 with center P between that line and the line which is its image under œÜ.
