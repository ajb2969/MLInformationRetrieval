   Kautz graph      Kautz graph   (Figure)  Example of Kautz graph on 3 characters with string length 2 (on the left) and 3 (on the right); the edges on the left correspond to the vertices on the right.   The Kautz graph     K  M   N  +  1      superscript   subscript  K  M     N  1     K_{M}^{N+1}   is a directed graph of degree   M   M   M   and dimension    N  +  1      N  1    N+1   , which has     (   M  +  1   )    M  N         M  1    superscript  M  N     (M+1)M^{N}   vertices labeled by all possible strings     s  0   ⋯   s  N        subscript  s  0   normal-⋯   subscript  s  N     s_{0}\cdots s_{N}   of length    N  +  1      N  1    N+1   which are composed of characters    s  i     subscript  s  i    s_{i}   chosen from an alphabet   A   A   A   containing    M  +  1      M  1    M+1   distinct symbols, subject to the condition that adjacent characters in the string cannot be equal (     s  i   ≠   s   i  +  1         subscript  s  i    subscript  s    i  1      s_{i}\neq s_{i+1}   ).  The Kautz graph    K  M   N  +  1      superscript   subscript  K  M     N  1     K_{M}^{N+1}   has     (   M  +  1   )    M   N  +  1          M  1    superscript  M    N  1      (M+1)M^{N+1}   edges      {   (    s  0    s  1   ⋯   s  N    ,    s  1    s  2   ⋯   s  N    s   N  +  1     )   |    s  i   ∈    A    s  i    ≠   s   i  +  1     }     conditional-set      subscript  s  0    subscript  s  1   normal-⋯   subscript  s  N       subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2   normal-⋯   subscript  s  N    subscript  s    N  1           subscript  s  i     A   subscript  s  i          subscript  s    i  1        \{(s_{0}s_{1}\cdots s_{N},s_{1}s_{2}\cdots s_{N}s_{N+1})|\;s_{i}\in A\;s_{i}%
 \neq s_{i+1}\}\,     It is natural to label each such edge of    K  M   N  +  1      superscript   subscript  K  M     N  1     K_{M}^{N+1}   as     s  0    s  1   ⋯   s   N  +  1         subscript  s  0    subscript  s  1   normal-⋯   subscript  s    N  1      s_{0}s_{1}\cdots s_{N+1}   , giving a one-to-one correspondence between edges of the Kautz graph    K  M   N  +  1      superscript   subscript  K  M     N  1     K_{M}^{N+1}   and vertices of the Kautz graph    K  M   N  +  2      superscript   subscript  K  M     N  2     K_{M}^{N+2}   .  Kautz graphs are closely related to De Bruijn graphs .  Properties   For a fixed degree   M   M   M   and number of vertices    V  =    (   M  +  1   )    M  N        V      M  1    superscript  M  N      V=(M+1)M^{N}   , the Kautz graph has the smallest diameter of any possible directed graph with   V   V   V   vertices and degree   M   M   M   .    All Kautz graphs have Eulerian cycles . (An Eulerian cycle is one which visits each edge exactly once-- This result follows because Kautz graphs have in-degree equal to out-degree for each node)    All Kautz graphs have a Hamiltonian cycle (This result follows from the correspondence described above between edges of the Kautz graph    K  M  N     superscript   subscript  K  M   N    K_{M}^{N}   and vertices of the Kautz graph    K  M   N  +  1      superscript   subscript  K  M     N  1     K_{M}^{N+1}   ; a Hamiltonian cycle on    K  M   N  +  1      superscript   subscript  K  M     N  1     K_{M}^{N+1}   is given by an Eulerian cycle on    K  M  N     superscript   subscript  K  M   N    K_{M}^{N}   )    A degree-   k   k   k   Kautz graph has   k   k   k   disjoint paths from any node   x   x   x   to any other node   y   y   y   .   In computing  The Kautz graph has been used as a network topology for connecting processors in high-performance computing 1 and fault-tolerant computing 2 applications: such a network is known as a Kautz network .
