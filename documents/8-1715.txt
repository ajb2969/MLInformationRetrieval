Kautz graph

(Figure)
Example of Kautz graph on 3 characters with string length 2 (on the left) and 3 (on the right); the edges on the left correspond to the vertices on the right.

The Kautz graph

 
  is a directed graph of degree 
 
 
 
  and dimension 
 
 
 
 , which has 
 
 
 
  vertices labeled by all possible strings 
 
 
 
  of length 
 
 
 
  which are composed of characters 
 
 
 
  chosen from an alphabet 
 
 
 
  containing 
 
 
 
  distinct symbols, subject to the condition that adjacent characters in the string cannot be equal (
 
 
 
 ).
The Kautz graph 
 
 
 
  has 
 
 
 
  edges



It is natural to label each such edge of 
 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 , giving a one-to-one correspondence between edges of the Kautz graph 
 
 
 
  and vertices of the Kautz graph 
 
 
 
 .
Kautz graphs are closely related to De Bruijn graphs.
Properties

For a fixed degree 
 
 
 
  and number of vertices 
 
 
 
 
 , the Kautz graph has the smallest diameter of any possible directed graph with 
 
 
 
  vertices and degree 
 
 
 
 .


All Kautz graphs have Eulerian cycles. (An Eulerian cycle is one which visits each edge exactly once-- This result follows because Kautz graphs have in-degree equal to out-degree for each node)


All Kautz graphs have a Hamiltonian cycle (This result follows from the correspondence described above between edges of the Kautz graph 
 
 
 
  and vertices of the Kautz graph 
 
 
 
 ; a Hamiltonian cycle on 
 
 
 
 
  is given by an Eulerian cycle on 
 
 
 
 )


A degree-
 
 
 
  Kautz graph has 
 
 
 
  disjoint paths from any node 
 
 
 
  to any other node 
 
 
 
 
 .

In computing
The Kautz graph has been used as a network topology for connecting processors in high-performance computing1 and fault-tolerant computing2 applications: such a network is known as a Kautz network.
