<h1>Defective coloring</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a href="graph_theory" title="wikilink">graph theory</a>, a mathematical discipline, <a href="Graph_coloring" title="wikilink">coloring</a> refers to an assignment of colours or labels to vertices, edges and faces of a graph. <strong>Defective coloring</strong> is a variant of proper vertex coloring. In a proper vertex coloring, the vertices are coloured such that no adjacent vertices have the same colour. In defective coloring, on the other hand, vertices are allowed to have neighbours of the same colour to a certain extent. (See here for <a href="Glossary_of_graph_theory" title="wikilink">Glossary of graph theory</a>)</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Defective coloring was introduced nearly simultaneously by Burr and Jacobson, Harary and Jones and Cowen, Cowen and Woodall.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Surveys of this and related colorings are given by Marietjie Frick.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Cowen, Cowen and Woodall <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> focused on graphs embedded on surfaces and gave a complete characterization of all <em>k</em> and <em>d</em> such that every planar is (<em>k</em>, <em>d</em>)-colorable. Namely, there does not exist a <em>d</em> such that every planar graph is (1, <em>d</em>)- or (2, <em>d</em>)-colorable; there exist planar graphs which are not (3, 1)-colorable, but every planar graph is (3, 2)-colorable. Together with the (4, 0)-coloring implied by the <a href="Four_color_theorem" title="wikilink">Four color theorem</a>, this solves defective chromatic number for the plane. Poh <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and Goddard <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> showed that any planar graph has a special (3,2)-coloring in ehich each color class is a linear forest, and this can be obtained from a more general result of Woodall. For general surfaces, it was shown that for each genus <span class="LaTeX">$g \geq 0$</span>, there exists a <span class="LaTeX">$k=k(g)$</span> such that every graph on the surface of genus <span class="LaTeX">$g$</span> is (4, <em>k</em>)-colorable.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This was improved to (3, <em>k</em>)-colorable by Archdeacon.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> For general graphs, a result of <a href="László_Lovász" title="wikilink">László Lovász</a> from the 1960s, which has been rediscovered many times <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> provides a <em>O(∆E)</em>-time algorithm for defective coloring graphs of maximum degree ∆.</p>
<h2 id="definitions-and-terminology">Definitions and terminology</h2>
<h3 id="defective-coloring">Defective coloring</h3>
<p>A (<em>k</em>, <em>d</em>)-coloring of a graph <em>G</em> is a coloring of its vertices with <em>k</em> colours such that each vertex <em>v</em> has at most <em>d</em> neighbours having the same colour as the vertex <em>v</em>. We consider <em>k</em> to be a positive integer (it is inconsequential to consider the case when <em>k</em> = 0) and <em>d</em> to be a non-negative integer. Hence, (<em>k</em>, 0)-coloring is equivalent to proper vertex coloring.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="d-defective-chromatic-number"><em>d</em>-Defective chromatic number</h3>
<p>The minimum number of colours <em>k</em> required for which <em>G</em> is (<em>k</em>, <em>d</em>)-colourable is called the ''' <em>d</em>-defective chromatic number''', <span class="LaTeX">$\chi_d (G)$</span>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="impropriety-of-a-vertex">Impropriety of a vertex</h3>
<p>Let <em>c</em> be a vertex-coloring of a graph <em>G</em>. The impropriety of a vertex <em>v</em> of <em>G</em> with respect to the coloring <em>c</em> is the number of neighbours of <em>v</em> that have the same color as <em>v</em>. If the impropriety of <em>v</em> is 0, then <em>v</em> is said to be properly colored.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="impropriety-of-a-vertex-coloring">Impropriety of a vertex-coloring</h3>
<p>Let <em>c</em> be a vertex-coloring of a graph <em>G</em>. The impropriety of <em>c</em> is the maximum of the improprieties of all vertices of <em>G</em>. Hence, the impropriety of a proper vertex coloring is 0.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p> An example of defective colouring of a cycle on five vertices, <span class="LaTeX">$C_5$</span>, is as shown in the figure. The first subfigure is an example of proper vertex colouring or a (<em>k</em>, 0)-coloring. The second subfigure is an example of a (<em>k</em>, 1)-coloring and the third subfigure is an example of a (<em>k</em>, 2)-coloring. Note that,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$\chi_0 (C_5) = \chi (C_5) = 3$</span> <span class="LaTeX">$\chi_1 (C_5) = 3$</span> <span class="LaTeX">$\chi_2 (C_n) = 1; \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$</span></p>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is generally enough to consider connected graphs as a graph <em>G</em> is (<em>k</em>, <em>d</em>)-colourable if and only if every component of <em>G</em> is (<em>k</em>, <em>d</em>)-colourable.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In graph theoretic terms, each colour class in a proper vertex coloring forms an <a href="independent_set_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">independent set</a>, while each colour class in a defective coloring forms a subgraph of degree at most <em>d</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If a graph is (<em>k</em>, <em>d</em>)-colourable, then it is (<em>k′</em>, <em>d′</em>)-colourable for each pair (<em>k′</em>, <em>d′</em>) such that <em>k′</em> ≥ <em>k</em> and <em>d′</em>≥ <em>d</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></li>

<h3 id="every-outerplanar-graph-is-22-colorable">Every <a href="outerplanar_graph" title="wikilink">outerplanar graph</a> is (2,2)-colorable'''</h3>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> Let <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> be a connected outerplanar graph. Let <span class="LaTeX">$v_0$</span> be an arbitrary vertex of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span>. Let <span class="LaTeX">$V_i$</span> be the set of vertices of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> that are at a distance <span class="LaTeX">$i$</span> from <span class="LaTeX">$v_0$</span>. Let <span class="LaTeX">$G_i$</span> be <span class="LaTeX">$\langle V_i \rangle$</span>, the subgraph induced by <span class="LaTeX">$V_i$</span>. Suppose <span class="LaTeX">$G_i$</span> contains a vertex of degree 3 or more, then it contains <span class="LaTeX">$K_{1,3}$</span> as a subgraph. Then we contract all edges of <span class="LaTeX">$V_0 \cup V_1 \cup ... \cup V_{i-1}$</span> to obtain a new graph <span class="LaTeX">$G'$</span>. It is to be noted that <span class="LaTeX">$\langle V_0 \cup V_1 \cup ... \cup V_{i-1} \rangle$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$G'$</span> is connected as every vertex in <span class="LaTeX">$V_i$</span> is adjacent to a vertex in <span class="LaTeX">$V_{i-1}$</span>. Hence, by <a href="Edge_contraction" title="wikilink">contracting</a> all the edges mentioned above, we obtain <span class="LaTeX">$G'$</span> such that the subgraph <span class="LaTeX">$\langle V_0 \cup V_1 \cup ... \cup V_{i-1} \rangle$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$G'$</span> is replaced by a single vertex that is adjacent to every vertex in <span class="LaTeX">$V_i$</span>. Thus <span class="LaTeX">$G'$</span> contains <span class="LaTeX">$K_{2,3}$</span> as a subgraph. But every subgraph of an outerplanar graph is outerplanar and every graph obtained by contracting edges of an outerplanar graph is outerplanar. This implies that <span class="LaTeX">$K_{2,3}$</span> is outerplanar, a contradiction. Hence no graph <span class="LaTeX">$G_i$</span> contains a vertex of degree 3 or more, implying that <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> is (<strong>k</strong>, 2)-colorable. It should also be noted that no vertex of <span class="LaTeX">$V_i$</span> is adjacent to any vertex of <span class="LaTeX">$V_{i-1}$</span> or <span class="LaTeX">$V_{i+1}, i \geqslant 1$</span>, hence the vertices of <span class="LaTeX">$V_i$</span> can be colored blue if <span class="LaTeX">$i$</span> is odd and red if even. Hence, we have produced a (2,2)-coloring of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Corollary: Every planar graph is (4,2)-colorable.</strong> This follows as if <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> is planar then every <span class="LaTeX">$G_i$</span> (same as above) is outerplanar. Hence every <span class="LaTeX">$G_i$</span> is (2,2)-colourable. Therefore each vertex of <span class="LaTeX">$V_i$</span> can be colored blue or red if <span class="LaTeX">$i$</span> is even and green or yellow if <span class="LaTeX">$i$</span> is odd, hence producing a (4,2)-coloring of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span>.</p>
<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
<p>An example of an application of defective colouring is the scheduling problem where vertices represent jobs (say users on a computer system), and edges represent conflicts (needing to access one or more of the same files). Allowing a defect means tolerating some threshold of conflict: each user may find the maximum slowdown incurred for retrieval of data with two conflicting other users on the system acceptable, and with more than two unacceptable.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
