   Naimark's dilation theorem      Naimark's dilation theorem   In operator theory , Naimark 's dilation theorem is a result that characterizes positive operator valued measures . It can be viewed as a consequence of Stinespring's dilation theorem .  Note  In the mathematical literature, one may also find other results that bear Naimark's name.  Spelling  In the physics literature, it is common to see the spelling "Neumark" instead of "Naimark." This is due to translating between the Russian alphabet spelling and the spelling in European languages (namely English and German) using the Roman alphabet .  Some preliminary notions  Let X be a compact  Hausdorff space , H be a Hilbert space , and L(H) the Banach space of bounded operators on H . A mapping E from the Borel σ-algebra on X to    L   (  H  )       L  H    L(H)   is called a operator-valued measure if it is weakly countably additive, that is, for any disjoint sequence of Borel sets    {   B  i   }      subscript  B  i     \{B_{i}\}   , we have       ⟨   E   (    ∪  i    B  i    )   x   ,  y  ⟩   =    ∑  i    ⟨   E   (   B  i   )   x   ,  y  ⟩           E    subscript   i    subscript  B  i    x   y     subscript   i      E   subscript  B  i   x   y      \langle E(\cup_{i}B_{i})x,y\rangle=\sum_{i}\langle E(B_{i})x,y\rangle     for all x and y . Some terminology for describing such measures are:   E is called regular if the scalar valued measure       B  →   ⟨   E   (  B  )   x   ,  y  ⟩      normal-→  B     E  B  x   y     B\rightarrow\langle E(B)x,y\rangle     is a regular Borel measure, meaning all compact sets have finite total variation and the measure of a set can be approximated by those of open sets.   E is called bounded if     |  E  |   =    sup  B    ∥   E   (  B  )    ∥    <  ∞          E     subscript  supremum  B    norm    E  B              |E|=\sup_{B}\|E(B)\|<\infty   .    E is called positive if E(B) is a positive operator for all B .    E is called ''self-adjoint '' if E(B) is self-adjoint for all B .    E is called spectral if it is self-adjoint and     E   (    B  1   ∩   B  2    )    =   E   (   B  1   )   E   (   B  2   )          E     subscript  B  1    subscript  B  2       E   subscript  B  1   E   subscript  B  2      E(B_{1}\cap B_{2})=E(B_{1})E(B_{2})   for all     B  1   ,   B  2       subscript  B  1    subscript  B  2     B_{1},B_{2}   .   We will assume throughout that E is regular.  Let C(X) denote the abelian C*-algebra of continuous functions on X . If E is regular and bounded, it induces a map     Φ  E   :    C   (  X  )    →   L   (  H  )        normal-:   subscript  normal-Φ  E    normal-→    C  X     L  H      \Phi_{E}:C(X)\rightarrow L(H)   in the obvious way:       ⟨    Φ  E    (  f  )    h  1    ,   h  2   ⟩   =    ∫  X    f   (  x  )    ⟨   E   (   d  x   )    h  1    ,   h  2   ⟩             subscript  normal-Φ  E   f   subscript  h  1     subscript  h  2      subscript   X     f  x     E    d  x    subscript  h  1     subscript  h  2        \langle\Phi_{E}(f)h_{1},h_{2}\rangle=\int_{X}f(x)\langle E(dx)h_{1},h_{2}\rangle     The boundedness of E implies, for all h of unit norm        ⟨    Φ  E    (  f  )   h   ,  h  ⟩   =    ∫  X    f   (  x  )    ⟨   E   (   d  x   )   h   ,  h  ⟩     ≤     ∥  f  ∥   ∞   ⋅   |  E  |     .            subscript  normal-Φ  E   f  h   h     subscript   X     f  x     E    d  x   h   h           normal-⋅   subscript   norm  f       E       \langle\Phi_{E}(f)h,h\rangle=\int_{X}f(x)\langle E(dx)h,h\rangle\leq\|f\|_{%
 \infty}\cdot|E|.     This shows      Φ   E    (  f  )        subscript  normal-Φ  E   f    \;\Phi_{E}(f)   is a bounded operator for all f , and    Φ  E     subscript  normal-Φ  E    \Phi_{E}   itself is a bounded linear map as well.  The properties of    Φ  E     subscript  normal-Φ  E    \Phi_{E}   are directly related to those of E :   If E is positive, then    Φ  E     subscript  normal-Φ  E    \Phi_{E}   , viewed as a map between C*-algebras, is also positive.        Φ  E     subscript  normal-Φ  E    \Phi_{E}   is a homomorphism if, by definition, for all continuous f on X and      h  1   ,   h  2    ∈  H        subscript  h  1    subscript  h  2    H    h_{1},h_{2}\in H   ,         ⟨    Φ  E    (   f  g   )    h  1    ,   h  2   ⟩   =    ∫  X      f   (  x  )    ⋅  g    (  x  )    ⟨   E   (   d  x   )    h  1    ,   h  2   ⟩     =   ⟨    Φ  E    (  f  )    Φ  E    (  g  )    h  1    ,   h  2   ⟩    .            subscript  normal-Φ  E     f  g    subscript  h  1     subscript  h  2      subscript   X      normal-⋅    f  x   g   x     E    d  x    subscript  h  1     subscript  h  2               subscript  normal-Φ  E   f   subscript  normal-Φ  E   g   subscript  h  1     subscript  h  2       \langle\Phi_{E}(fg)h_{1},h_{2}\rangle=\int_{X}f(x)\cdot g(x)\;\langle E(dx)h_{%
 1},h_{2}\rangle=\langle\Phi_{E}(f)\Phi_{E}(g)h_{1},h_{2}\rangle.     Take f and g to be indicator functions of Borel sets and we see that    Φ  E     subscript  normal-Φ  E    \Phi_{E}   is a homomorphism if and only if E is spectral.   Similarly, to say    Φ  E     subscript  normal-Φ  E    \Phi_{E}   respects the * operation means         ⟨    Φ  E    (   f  ¯   )    h  1    ,   h  2   ⟩   =   ⟨    Φ  E     (  f  )   *    h  1    ,   h  2   ⟩    .          subscript  normal-Φ  E    normal-¯  f    subscript  h  1     subscript  h  2        subscript  normal-Φ  E    superscript  f     subscript  h  1     subscript  h  2      \langle\Phi_{E}({\bar{f}})h_{1},h_{2}\rangle=\langle\Phi_{E}(f)^{*}h_{1},h_{2}\rangle.     The LHS is        ∫  X      f  ¯     ⟨   E   (   d  x   )    h  1    ,   h  2   ⟩     ,      subscript   X      normal-¯  f      E    d  x    subscript  h  1     subscript  h  2       \int_{X}{\bar{f}}\;\langle E(dx)h_{1},h_{2}\rangle,     and the RHS is       ⟨   h  1   ,    Φ  E    (  f  )    h  2    ⟩   =    ⟨    Φ  E    (  f  )    h  2    ,   h  1   ⟩   ¯   =    ∫  X     f  ¯    (  x  )     ⟨   E   (   d  x   )    h  2    ,   h  1   ⟩   ¯     =    ∫  X     f  ¯    (  x  )    ⟨   h  1   ,   E   (   d  x   )    h  2    ⟩             subscript  h  1      subscript  normal-Φ  E   f   subscript  h  2      normal-¯      subscript  normal-Φ  E   f   subscript  h  2     subscript  h  1            subscript   X      normal-¯  f   x   normal-¯     E    d  x    subscript  h  2     subscript  h  1              subscript   X      normal-¯  f   x    subscript  h  1     E    d  x    subscript  h  2          \langle h_{1},\Phi_{E}(f)h_{2}\rangle=\overline{\langle\Phi_{E}(f)h_{2},h_{1}%
 \rangle}=\int_{X}{\bar{f}}(x)\;\overline{\langle E(dx)h_{2},h_{1}\rangle}=\int%
 _{X}{\bar{f}}(x)\;\langle h_{1},E(dx)h_{2}\rangle     So, taking f a sequence of continuous functions increasing to the indicator function of B , we get     ⟨   E   (  B  )    h  1    ,   h  2   ⟩   =   ⟨   h  1   ,   E   (  B  )    h  2    ⟩          E  B   subscript  h  1     subscript  h  2      subscript  h  1     E  B   subscript  h  2       \langle E(B)h_{1},h_{2}\rangle=\langle h_{1},E(B)h_{2}\rangle   , i.e. E(B) is self adjoint.   Combining the previous two facts gives the conclusion that    Φ  E     subscript  normal-Φ  E    \Phi_{E}   is a *-homomorphism if and only if E is spectral and self adjoint. (When E is spectral and self adjoint, E is said to be a projection-valued measure or PVM.)   Naimark's theorem  The theorem reads as follows: Let E be a positive L(H) -valued measure on X . There exists a Hilbert space K , a bounded operator    V  :   K  →  H      normal-:  V   normal-→  K  H     V:K\rightarrow H   , and a self-adjoint, spectral L(K) -valued measure on X , F , such that         E    (  B  )    =   V  F   (  B  )    V  *     .        E  B     V  F  B   superscript  V       \;E(B)=VF(B)V^{*}.     Proof  We now sketch the proof. The argument passes E to the induced map    Φ  E     subscript  normal-Φ  E    \Phi_{E}   and uses Stinespring's dilation theorem . Since E is positive, so is    Φ  E     subscript  normal-Φ  E    \Phi_{E}   as a map between C*-algebras, as explained above. Furthermore, because the domain of    Φ  E     subscript  normal-Φ  E    \Phi_{E}   , C(X) , is an abelian C*-algebra, we have that    Φ  E     subscript  normal-Φ  E    \Phi_{E}   is completely positive . By Stinespring's result, there exists a Hilbert space K , a *-homomorphism    π  :    C   (  X  )    →   L   (  K  )        normal-:  π   normal-→    C  X     L  K      \pi:C(X)\rightarrow L(K)   , and operator    V  :   K  →  H      normal-:  V   normal-→  K  H     V:K\rightarrow H   such that          Φ   E    (  f  )    =   V  π   (  f  )    V  *     .         subscript  normal-Φ  E   f     V  π  f   superscript  V       \;\Phi_{E}(f)=V\pi(f)V^{*}.     Since π is a *-homomorphism, its corresponding operator-valued measure F is spectral and self adjoint. It is easily seen that F has the desired properties.  Finite-dimensional case  In the finite-dimensional case, there is a somewhat more explicit formulation.  Suppose now    X  =   {  1  ,  …  ,  n  }       X   1  normal-…  n     X=\{1,\ldots,n\}   , therefore C ( X ) is the finite-dimensional algebra    ℂ  n     superscript  ℂ  n    \mathbb{C}^{n}   , and H has finite dimension m . A positive operator-valued measure E then assigns each i a positive semidefinite m × m matrix    E  i     subscript  E  i    E_{i}   . Naimark's theorem now states that there is a projection-valued measure on X whose restriction is E .  Of particular interest is the special case when      ∑  i    E  i    =  I        subscript   i    subscript  E  i    I    \sum_{i}E_{i}=I   where I is the identity operator. (See the article on POVM for relevant applications.) In this case, the induced map    Φ  E     subscript  normal-Φ  E    \Phi_{E}   is unital. It can be assumed with no loss of generality that each    E  i     subscript  E  i    E_{i}   is a rank-one projection onto some     x  i   ∈   ℂ  m        subscript  x  i    superscript  ℂ  m     x_{i}\in\mathbb{C}^{m}   . Under such assumptions, the case    n  <  m      n  m    n   is excluded and we must have either       n  =  m      n  m    n=m   and E is already a projection-valued measure (because      ∑   i  =  1   n     x  i    x  i  *     =  I        superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  x  i    superscript   subscript  x  i       I    \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}x_{i}^{*}=I   if and only if    {   x  i   }      subscript  x  i     \{x_{i}\}   is an orthonormal basis),      n  >  m      n  m    n>m   and    {   E  i   }      subscript  E  i     \{E_{i}\}   does not consist of mutually orthogonal projections.   For the second possibility, the problem of finding a suitable projection-valued measure now becomes the following problem. By assumption, the non-square matrix      M  =   [       x  1   ⋯   x  n       ]       M       subscript  x  1   normal-⋯   subscript  x  n        M=\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}\cdots x_{n}\end{bmatrix}   is an isometry, that is     M   M  *    =  I        M   superscript  M     I    MM^{*}=I   . If we can find a     (   n  -  m   )   ×  n        n  m   n    (n-m)\times n   matrix N where      U  =   [     M      N     ]       U    M    N      U=\begin{bmatrix}M\\
 N\end{bmatrix}   is a n × n unitary matrix, the projection-valued measure whose elements are projections onto the column vectors of U will then have the desired properties. In principle, such a N can always be found.  References   V. Paulsen, Completely Bounded Maps and Operator Algebras , Cambridge University Press, 2003.
