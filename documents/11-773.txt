Unger model

The Unger Model is an empirical standard model for near end crosstalk (NEXT) power spectra as experienced by communication systems over unshielded twisted pair (UTP).
Twisted pair cables are usually grouped together in a binder where they experience crosstalk. Based on empirical observations, Unger 1 proposed that, at the 1% worst case, the NEXT power spectra 
 
 
 
 , due to a single disturber, can be bounded by

 
  while the NEXT power spectra due to 49 disturbers (full binder) can be bounded by
