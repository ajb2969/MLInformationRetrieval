   Unger model      Unger model   The Unger Model is an empirical standard model for near end crosstalk (NEXT) power  spectra as experienced by communication systems over unshielded twisted pair (UTP).  Twisted pair cables are usually grouped together in a binder where they experience crosstalk . Based on empirical observations, Unger 1 proposed that, at the 1% worst case, the NEXT power spectra     |    H   N  E  X  T     (  f  )    |   2     superscript       subscript  H    N  E  X  T    f    2    |H_{NEXT}(f)|^{2}   , due to a single disturber, can be bounded by      10   log   (    |    H   N  E  X  T     (  f  )    |   2   )     =   {       -  66   +   6   log   (  f  )    d  B       f  <   20  K  H  z          -  50.5   +   15   log   (  f  )    d  B       f  ≥   20  K  H  z              10     superscript       subscript  H    N  E  X  T    f    2      cases      66     6    f   d  B      f    20  K  H  z        50.5     15    f   d  B      f    20  K  H  z       10\log(|H_{NEXT}(f)|^{2})=\begin{cases}-66+6\log(f)dB&f<20KHz\\
