   B-admissible representation      B-admissible representation   In mathematics , the formalism of B -admissible representations provides constructions of full  Tannakian  subcategories of the category of representations of a group  G on finite-dimensional  vector spaces over a given field  E . In this theory, B is chosen to be a so-called ( E , G )-regular ring , i.e. an E -algebra with an E -linear action of G satisfying certain conditions given below. This theory is most prominently used in p -adic Hodge theory to define important subcategories of p -adic Galois representations of the absolute Galois group of local and global fields .  ( E , G )-rings and the functor D  Let G be a group and E a field. Let Rep( G ) denote a non-trivial strictly full subcategory of the Tannakian category of E -linear representations of G on finite-dimensional vector spaces over E stable under subobjects , quotient objects , direct sums , tensor products , and duals . 1  An ( E , G )-ring is a commutative ring  B that is an E -algebra with an E -linear action of G . Let F = B G be the G -invariants of B . The covariant functor  D B : Rep( G ) → Mod F defined by        D  B    (  V  )    :=    (   B   ⊗  E   V   )   G      assign     subscript  D  B   V    superscript    subscript  tensor-product  E   B  V   G     D_{B}(V):=(B\otimes_{E}V)^{G}   is E -linear (Mod F denotes the category of F -modules ). The inclusion of D B (V) in B ⊗ E V induces a homomorphism       α   B  ,  V    :     B   ⊗  F    D  B     (  V  )    ⟶   B   ⊗  E   V       normal-:   subscript  α   B  V     normal-⟶      subscript  tensor-product  F   B   subscript  D  B    V     subscript  tensor-product  E   B  V      \alpha_{B,V}:B\otimes_{F}D_{B}(V)\longrightarrow B\otimes_{E}V   called the comparison morphism . 2  Regular ( E , G )-rings and B -admissible representations  An ( E , G )-ring B is called regular if   B is reduced ;  for every V in Rep( G ), α B,V is injective ;  every b ∈ B for which the line bE is G -stable is invertible in B .   The third condition implies F is a field. If B is a field, it is automatically regular.  When B is regular,        dim  F     D  B    (  V  )     ≤    dim  E   V         subscript  dimension  F      subscript  D  B   V      subscript  dimension  E   V     \dim_{F}D_{B}(V)\leq\dim_{E}V   with equality if, and only if, α B,V is an isomorphism .  A representation V ∈ Rep( G ) is called B -admissible if α B,V is an isomorphism. The full subcategory of B -admissible representations, denoted Rep B ( G ), is Tannakian.  If B has extra structure, such as a filtration or an E -linear endomorphism , then D B ( V ) inherits this structure and the functor D B can be viewed as taking values in the corresponding category.  Examples   Let K be a field of characteristic  p (a prime), and K s a separable closure of K . If E = F p (the finite field with p elements) and G = Gal( K s / K ) (the absolute Galois group of K ), then B = K s is a regular ( E , G )-ring. On K s there is an injective Frobenius endomorphism σ : K s → K s sending x to x p . Given a representation G → GL( V ) for some finite-dimensional F p -vector space V ,    D  =    D   K  s     (  V  )        D     subscript  D   subscript  K  s    V     D=D_{K_{s}}(V)   is a finite-dimensional vector space over F =( K s ) G = K which inherits from B = K s an injective function φ D : D → D which is σ-semilinear (i.e. φ( ad ) = σ( a )φ( d ) for all a ∈ K and all d ∈ D ). The K s -admissible representations are the continuous ones (where G has the Krull topology and V has the discrete topology ). In fact,    D   K  s      subscript  D   subscript  K  s     D_{K_{s}}   is an equivalence of categories between the K s -admissible representations (i.e. continuous ones) and the finite-dimensional vector spaces over K equipped with an injective σ-semilinear φ.   Potentially B -admissible representations  A potentially B -admissible representation captures the idea of a representation that becomes B -admissible when restricted to some subgroup of G .

In this case, the functor used is      D  B  ∗    (  V  )    :=    Hom  G    (  V  ,  B  )       assign     superscript   subscript  D  B   normal-∗   V      subscript  Hom  G    V  B      D_{B}^{\ast}(V):=\mathrm{Hom}_{G}(V,B)   , the G -invariant linear homomorphisms from V to B . ↩
