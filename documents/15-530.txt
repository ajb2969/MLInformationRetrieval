Mass number


A = (Relative) atomic mass = Mass number = Number of protons and neutrons
N = Number of neutrons
Z = Atomic number = Number of protons = Number of electrons









Mass in nuclei


M'nuc = Mass of nucleus, bound nucleons
MΣ = Sum of masses for isolated nucleons
mp = proton rest mass
