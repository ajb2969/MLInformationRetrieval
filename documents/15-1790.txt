   Perfectoid      Perfectoid   In mathematics, perfectoid objects occur in the study of problems of " mixed characteristic ", such as local fields of characteristic zero which have residue fields of characteristic prime p . The notion was introduced by Peter Scholze .  A perfectoid field is a complete topological field  K whose topology is induced by a nondiscrete valuation of rank 1, such that the Frobenius endomorphism Φ is surjective on K °/ p where K ° denotes the ring of power-bounded elements.  Associated to any perfectoid field K there is another K ♭ of characteristic p where the multiplication may be defined as        K  ♭   =     lim  ←    x  ↦   x  p      K     .       superscript  K  normal-♭     subscript  projective-limit   maps-to  x   superscript  x  p     K     K^{\flat}=\underleftarrow{\lim}_{x\mapsto x^{p}}K\ .     The absolute Galois groups of K and K ♭ are isomorphic.
