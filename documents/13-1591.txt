  |- !Orthogonal projections in A6 Coxeter plane |} In six-dimensional geometry, a rectified 6-cube is a convex uniform 6-polytope, being a rectification of the regular 6-cube.
There are unique 6 degrees of rectifications, the zeroth being the 6-cube, and the 6th and last being the 6-orthoplex. Vertices of the rectified 6-cube are located at the edge-centers of the 6-cube. Vertices of the birectified 6-ocube are located in the square face centers of the 6-cube.

Construction
The rectified 6-cube may be constructed from the 6-cube by truncating its vertices at the midpoints of its edges.
Coordinates
The Cartesian coordinates of the vertices of the rectified 6-cube with edge length √2 are all permutations of:
