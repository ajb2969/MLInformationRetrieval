   Transitive set      Transitive set   In set theory , a set  A is transitive , if and only if   whenever x ∈ A , and y ∈ x , then y ∈ A , or, equivalently,  whenever x ∈ A , and x is not an urelement , then x is a subset of A .   Similarly, a class  M is transitive if every element of M is a subset of M .  Examples  Using the definition of ordinal numbers suggested by John von Neumann , ordinal numbers are defined as hereditarily transitive sets: an ordinal number is a transitive set whose members are also transitive (and thus ordinals).  Any of the stages V α and L α leading to the construction of the von Neumann universe  V and Gödel's constructible universe  L are transitive sets. The universes  L and V themselves are transitive classes.  Properties  A set X is transitive if and only if     ⋃  X   ⊆  X        X   X    \bigcup X\subseteq X   , where    ⋃  X      X    \bigcup X   is the union of all elements of X that are sets,    ⋃  X  =   {  y  ∣   (  ∃  x  ∈  X  )   y  ∈  x  }      fragments   X    fragments  normal-{  y  normal-∣   fragments  normal-(   x   X  normal-)   y   x  normal-}     \bigcup X=\{y\mid(\exists x\in X)y\in x\}   . If X is transitive, then    ⋃  X      X    \bigcup X   is transitive. If X and Y are transitive, then X ∪ Y ∪{ X , Y } is transitive. In general, if X is a class all of whose elements are transitive sets, then    X  ∪   ⋃  X       X    X     X\cup\bigcup X   is transitive.  A set X which does not contain urelements is transitive if and only if it is a subset of its own power set ,     X  ⊂   𝒫   (  X  )     .      X    𝒫  X     X\subset\mathcal{P}(X).   The power set of a transitive set without urelements is transitive.  Transitive closure  The transitive closure of a set X is the smallest (with respect to inclusion) transitive set which contains X . Suppose one is given a set X , then the transitive closure of X is       ⋃   {  X  ,   ⋃  X   ,   ⋃   ⋃  X    ,   ⋃   ⋃   ⋃  X     ,   ⋃   ⋃   ⋃   ⋃  X      ,  …  }    .       X    X       X          X             X      normal-…     \bigcup\{X,\bigcup X,\bigcup\bigcup X,\bigcup\bigcup\bigcup X,\bigcup\bigcup%
 \bigcup\bigcup X,\ldots\}.   Note that this is the set of all of the objects related to X by the transitive closure of the membership relation.  Transitive models of set theory  Transitive classes are often used for construction of interpretations of set theory in itself, usually called inner models . The reason is that properties defined by bounded formulas are absolute for transitive classes.  A transitive set (or class) that is a model of a formal system of set theory is called a transitive model of the system. Transitivity is an important factor in determining the absoluteness of formulas.  In the superstructure approach to non-standard analysis , the non-standard universes satisfy strong transitivity. 1  See also   End extension  Transitive relation  Supertransitive class   References       External links       "  Category:Set theory     Goldblatt (1998) p.161 ↩
