   Cubic reciprocity      Cubic reciprocity   Cubic reciprocity is a collection of theorems in elementary and algebraic  number theory that state conditions under which the congruence  x 3 ≡ p (mod q ) is solvable; the word "reciprocity" comes from the form of the main theorem , which states that if p and q are primary numbers in the ring of Eisenstein integers , both coprime to 3, the congruence x 3 ≡ p (mod q ) is solvable if and only if x 3 ≡ q (mod p ) is solvable.  History  Sometime before 1748 Euler made the first conjectures about the cubic residuacity of small integers, but they were not published until 1849, after his death. 1  Gauss's published works mention cubic residues and reciprocity three times: there is one result pertaining to cubic residues in the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801). 2 In the introduction to the fifth and sixth proofs of quadratic reciprocity (1818) 3 he said that he was publishing these proofs because their techniques ( Gauss's lemma and Gaussian sums , respectively) can be applied to cubic and biquadratic reciprocity. Finally, a footnote in the second (of two) monographs on biquadratic reciprocity (1832) states that cubic reciprocity is most easily described in the ring of Eisenstein integers. 4  From his diary and other unpublished sources, it appears that Gauss knew the rules for the cubic and quartic residuacity of integers by 1805, and discovered the full-blown theorems and proofs of cubic and biquadratic reciprocity around 1814. 5 6 Proofs of these were found in his posthumous papers, but it is not clear if they are his or Eisenstein's. 7  Jacobi published several theorems about cubic residuacity in 1827, but no proofs. 8 In his Königsberg lectures of 1836–37 Jacobi presented proofs. 9 The first published proofs were by Eisenstein (1844). 10 11 12  Integers  A cubic residue (mod p ) is any number congruent to the third power of an integer (mod p ). If x 3 ≡ a (mod p ) does not have an integer solution, a is a cubic nonresidue (mod p ). 13  As is often the case in number theory, it is easiest to work modulo prime numbers, so in this section all moduli p , q , etc., are assumed to be positive, odd primes. 14  The first thing to notice when working within the ring Z of integers is that if the prime number q is ≡ 2 (mod 3) every number is a cubic residue (mod q ). Let q = 3 n + 2; since 0 = 0 3 is obviously a cubic residue, assume x is not divisible by q . Then by Fermat's little theorem ,       x  q   =   x    3  n   +  2    ≡  x    (   mod  q   )     and    x   q  -  1    =   x    3  n   +  1    ≡  1   (   mod  q   )   ,  so     fragments   superscript  x  q     superscript  x      3  n   2     x   pmod  q   and   superscript  x    q  1      superscript  x      3  n   1     1   pmod  q   normal-,  so    x^{q}=x^{3n+2}\equiv x\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}q)\;\mbox{ and }\;x^{q-1}=x^{3n+1%

 \mathop{{\rm mod}}q)     is a cubic residue (mod q ).  Therefore, the only interesting case is when the modulus p ≡ 1 (mod 3).  In this case, p ≡ 1 (mod 3), the nonzero residue classes (mod p ) can be divided into three sets, each containing ( p −1)/3 numbers. Let e be a cubic nonresidue. The first set is the cubic residues; the second one is e times the numbers in the first set, and the third is e 2 times the numbers in the first set. Another way to describe this division is to let e be a primitive root (mod p ); then the first (respectively second, third) set is the numbers whose indices with respect to this root are ≡ 0 (resp. 1, 2) (mod 3). In the vocabulary of group theory , the first set is a subgroup of index 3 (of the multiplicative group Z / p Z  × ), and the other two are its cosets.  Primes ≡ 1 (mod 3)  A theorem of Fermat 15 16 states that every prime p ≡ 1 (mod 3) is the sum of a square and three times a square: p = a 2 + 3 b 2 and (except for the signs of a and b ) this representation is unique.  Letting m = a + b and n = a − b , we see that this is equivalent to p = m 2 − mn + n 2 (which equals ( n − m ) 2 − ( n − m ) n + n 2 = m 2 + m ( n − m ) + ( n − m ) 2 , so m and n are not determined uniquely). Thus,      4  p      4  p    \displaystyle 4p   and it is a straightforward exercise to show that exactly one of m , n , or m − n is a multiple of 3, so       p  =     1  4     (    L  2   +   27   M  2     )     ,      p      1  4      superscript  L  2     27   superscript  M  2        p=\tfrac{1}{4}\left(L^{2}+27M^{2}\right),   and this representation is unique up to the signs of L and M . 17  For relatively prime integers m and n define the rational cubic residue symbol as        [   m  n   ]   3   =   {          +   1  if  m  is a cubic residue       (   mod  n   )             -   1  if  m  is a cubic nonresidue       (   mod  n   )             subscript   delimited-[]    m  n    3    cases  absent   annotated      1  if  m  is a cubic residue     pmod  n    absent   annotated      1  if  m  is a cubic nonresidue     pmod  n       \left[\frac{m}{n}\right]_{3}=\begin{cases}&+1\mbox{ if }m\mbox{ is a cubic %

 &-1\mbox{ if }m\mbox{ is a cubic nonresidue }\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}n)\end{cases}     Euler  Euler's conjectures 18 19 are based on the representation p = a 2 + 3 b 2 .        [    2  p    ]   3   =  1       subscript   delimited-[]    2  p    3   1    \displaystyle\left[\frac{2}{p}\right]_{3}=1    20  The first two can be restated as 21 22 23   Let p ≡ 1 (mod 3) be a positive prime. Then 2 is a cubic residue of p if and only if p = a 2 +  27 b 2 .  Let p ≡ 1 (mod 3) be a positive prime. Then 3 is a cubic residue of p if and only if  4 p = a 2 + 243 b 2 .   Another conjecture of Euler is: 24       If    [   7  p   ]   3    =   1  ,  then         If   subscript   delimited-[]    7  p    3     1  then     \mbox{ If }\left[\frac{7}{p}\right]_{3}=1,\mbox{ then }            (3|b\mbox{ and }7|a), \mbox{ or } 21|(b\pm a), \mbox{ or } 7|(4b\pm a), \mbox{ or } 21|b, \mbox{ or } 7|(b\pm 2a).  Gauss  Gauss 25 26 proves that if     p  =    3  n   +  1   =    1  4    (    L  2   +   27   M  2     )     ,        p      3  n   1            1  4      superscript  L  2     27   superscript  M  2         p=3n+1=\tfrac{1}{4}\left(L^{2}+27M^{2}\right),   then      L    (   n  !   )   3    ≡   1     (   mod  p   )     ,        L   superscript    n   3     annotated  1   pmod  p      L(n!)^{3}\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p),   from which      [   L  p   ]   3   =    [   M  p   ]   3   =  1         subscript   delimited-[]    L  p    3    subscript   delimited-[]    M  p    3        1     \left[\frac{L}{p}\right]_{3}=\left[\frac{M}{p}\right]_{3}=1   is an easy deduction.  Jacobi  Jacobi stated (without proof) 27  Let q ≡ p ≡ 1 (mod 6) be positive primes,     p  =    1  4    (    L  2   +   27   M  2     )     ,      p      1  4      superscript  L  2     27   superscript  M  2        p=\tfrac{1}{4}\left(L^{2}+27M^{2}\right),   and let x be a solution of x 2 ≡ −3 (mod q ). Then        [   q  p   ]   3   =   1  if and only if    [      L  +   3  M  x    2   p   q   ]   3    =   1  if and only if    [    (    L  +   3  M  x     L  -   3  M  x     )   q   ]   3    =  1.         subscript   delimited-[]    q  p    3     1  if and only if   subscript   delimited-[]          L    3  M  x    2   p   q    3           1  if and only if   subscript   delimited-[]        L    3  M  x      L    3  M  x     q    3         1.     \left[\frac{q}{p}\right]_{3}=1\mbox{ if and only if }\left[\frac{\frac{L+3Mx}{%
 2}p}{q}\right]_{3}=1\mbox{ if and only if }\left[\frac{(\frac{L+3Mx}{L-3Mx})}{%

If     q  =    1  4    (    L   ′  2    +   27   M   ′  2      )     ,      q      1  4      superscript  L   normal-′  2      27   superscript  M   normal-′  2         q=\tfrac{1}{4}\left(L^{\prime 2}+27M^{\prime 2}\right),   then    x  ≡    ±    L  ′    3   M  ′         (   mod  q   )        x   annotated   plus-or-minus     superscript  L  normal-′     3   superscript  M  normal-′       pmod  q      x\equiv\pm\frac{L^{\prime}}{3M^{\prime}}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}q)   , and we have        [   q  p   ]   3   =   1  if and only if    [    (     L   M  ′    +    L  ′   M      L   M  ′    -    L  ′   M     )   q   ]   3    =  1.         subscript   delimited-[]    q  p    3     1  if and only if   subscript   delimited-[]          L   superscript  M  normal-′       superscript  L  normal-′   M        L   superscript  M  normal-′       superscript  L  normal-′   M     q    3         1.     \left[\frac{q}{p}\right]_{3}=1\mbox{ if and only if }\left[\frac{(\frac{LM^{%

Along the same lines, von Lienen proved 28          (   p  q   )   3     (   q  p   )   3    =    (    (      L  ′   M   +   L   M  ′      2  M    )   p   )   3  2    .         subscript    p  q   3    subscript    q  p   3     superscript   subscript           superscript  L  normal-′   M     L   superscript  M  normal-′       2  M    p   3   2     \left(\frac{p}{q}\right)_{3}\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)_{3}=\left(\frac{(\frac{L^%
 {\prime}M+LM^{\prime}}{2M})}{p}\right)_{3}^{2}.     In this expression, the definition of     (   p  q   )   3     subscript    p  q   3    \left(\frac{p}{q}\right)_{3}   is different from the one used elsewhere. To explain this, we split   p   p   p   and   q   q   q   into    p  =   π   π  ¯        p    π   normal-¯  π      p=\pi\overline{\pi}   ,    q  =   ρ   ρ  ¯        q    ρ   normal-¯  ρ      q=\rho\overline{\rho}   , where    π  ,   π  ¯   ,  ρ  ,   ρ  ¯      π   normal-¯  π   ρ   normal-¯  ρ     \pi,\overline{\pi},\rho,\overline{\rho}   are Eisenstein primes     ≡  2   (   m  o  d  3   )       normal-≡  2    m  o  d  3     ≡2(mod3)   that satisfy      ρ  ≡  N   /  2   M   (   m  o  d  π   )           ρ  normal-≡  N   2   M    m  o  d  π     ρ≡N/2M(modπ)   ,      π  ≡  N   /  2   M  ′   (   m  o  d  ρ   )           π  normal-≡  N   2   M  normal-′    m  o  d  ρ     π≡N/2M′(modρ)   ,    N  =    L  ′  M   +   L  M  ′        N      L  normal-′  M     L  M  normal-′      N=L′M+LM′   ,    L  ≡  L  ′  ≡  1   (   m  o  d  3   )       L  normal-≡  L  normal-′  normal-≡  1    m  o  d  3     L≡L′≡1(mod3)   . Von Lienen defined     (   p  q   )   3     subscript    p  q   3    \left(\frac{p}{q}\right)_{3}   as , where denotes a cubic residue character modulo   ρ   ρ   ρ   (see below ). Note that the value of     L  i   (  p  ,  q  )    =         L  i   p  q    absent    Li(p,q)=        (   p  q   )   3     subscript    p  q   3    \left(\frac{p}{q}\right)_{3}   is not uniquely determined. For example, when    p  =   α   α  ¯        p    α   normal-¯  α      p=\alpha\overline{\alpha}   satisfies the above conditions, one can choose either   α   α   \alpha   or    α  ¯     normal-¯  α    \overline{\alpha}   and call it   π   π   π   . However, once   π   π   π   is chosen,      ρ  ≡  N   /  2   M   (   m  o  d  π   )           ρ  normal-≡  N   2   M    m  o  d  π     ρ≡N/2M(modπ)   is uniquely determined, and both Li( x , q ) and Li( x , p ) are unambiguously defined for any x .  Example:    p  =  13  =    (    −  1   +   3  ω    )    (   −  4  −  3  ω   )          p  13             normal-−  1     3  ω      normal-−  4  normal-−  3  ω       p=13=(−1+3ω)(−4−3ω)   ,    q  =  79  =    (    −  7   +   3  ω    )    (   −  10  −  3  ω   )          q  79             normal-−  7     3  ω      normal-−  10  normal-−  3  ω       q=79=(−7+3ω)(−10−3ω)   ,    L  =   −  5       L    normal-−  5     L=−5   ,    M  =  1      M  1    M=1   ,     L  ′   =   −  17         L  normal-′     normal-−  17     L′=−17   ,     M  ′   =  1        M  normal-′   1    M′=1   .   One can choose    π  =   −  4  −  3  ω       π    normal-−  4  normal-−  3  ω     π=−4−3ω   and    ρ  =    −  7   +   3  ω        ρ      normal-−  7     3  ω      ρ=−7+3ω   . Then ω 2 }} , 1}} , ω}} , satisfying (χ π ( N /2 M )) 2 }} , that is (Li( N /2 M , p )) 2 }} .  Alternatively, one can choose    π  =    −  1   +   3  ω        π      normal-−  1     3  ω      π=−1+3ω   and    ρ  =   −  10  −  3  ω       ρ    normal-−  10  normal-−  3  ω     ρ=−10−3ω   . Then ω, χ π ( q ) {{=}} 1, χ π ( N /2 M ) {{=}} ω 2 }} . These values are different from the previous ones, but they satisfy the same relationship.

Eisenstein integers  Background  In his second monograph on biquadratic reciprocity, Gauss says:   The theorems on biquadratic residues gleam with the greatest simplicity and genuine beauty only when the field of arithmetic is extended to imaginary numbers, so that without restriction, the numbers of the form a + bi constitute the object of study ... we call such numbers integral complex numbers . 33 [bold in the original]   These numbers are now called the ring of Gaussian integers , denoted by Z [ i ]. Note that i is a fourth root of 1.  In a footnote he adds   The theory of cubic residues must be based in a similar way on a consideration of numbers of the form a + bh where h is an imaginary root of the equation h 3 = 1 ... and similarly the theory of residues of higher powers leads to the introduction of other imaginary quantities. 34   In his first monograph on cubic reciprocity 35 Eisenstein developed the theory of the numbers built up from a cube root of unity; they are now called the ring of Eisenstein integers . Eisenstein said (paraphrasing) "to investigate the properties of this ring one need only consult Gauss's work on Z [ i ] and modify the proofs". This is not surprising since both rings are unique factorization domains .  The "other imaginary quantities" needed for the "theory of residues of higher powers" are the rings of integers of the cyclotomic number fields ; the Gaussian and Eisenstein integers are the simplest examples of these.  Facts and terminology  Let    ω  =     -  1   +   i   3     2   =   e    2  π  i   3          ω        1     i    3     2         superscript  e      2  π  i   3       \omega=\frac{-1+i\sqrt{3}}{2}=e^{\frac{2\pi i}{3}}   be a complex cube root of unity . The Eisenstein integers Z [ω] are all numbers of the form a + b ω where a and b are ordinary integers .  Since ω 3 − 1 = (ω − 1)(ω 2 + ω + 1) = 0 and ω ≠ 1, we have ω 2 = − ω − 1 and ω = − ω 2 − 1. Since      ω  3   =   ω   ω  2    =   ω   ω  ¯    =  1   ,    ω  ¯   =   ω  2       formulae-sequence       superscript  ω  3     ω   superscript  ω  2           ω   normal-¯  ω         1       normal-¯  ω    superscript  ω  2      \omega^{3}=\omega\omega^{2}=\omega\overline{\omega}=1,\;\;\ \overline{\omega}=%
 \omega^{2}   and      ω  2   ¯   =  ω       normal-¯   superscript  ω  2    ω    \overline{\omega^{2}}=\omega   where the bar denotes complex conjugation . Also,      ω  -   ω  ¯    =   i   3     .        ω   normal-¯  ω      i    3      \omega-\overline{\omega}=i\sqrt{3}.     If λ = a + b ω and μ = c + d ω,   λ + μ = ( a + c ) + ( b + d )ω and  λ μ = ac + ( ad + bc )ω + bd ω 2 = ( ac − bd ) + ( ad + bc − bd )ω.   This shows that Z [ω] is closed under addition and multiplication, making it a ring .  The units are the numbers that divide 1. They are ±1, ±ω, and ±ω 2 . They are similar to 1 and −1 in the ordinary integers, in that they divide every number. The units are the powers of −ω, a sixth (not just a third) root of unity.  Given a number λ = a + b ω, its conjugate means its complex conjugate a + bω 2 = ( a − b ) − b ω  (not a − b ω), and its associates are its six unit multiples: 36     λ   λ   \displaystyle\lambda     The norm of λ = a + b ω is the product of λ and its conjugate      N  λ   =   λ   λ  ¯    =     a  2   -   a  b    +   b  2     .          normal-N  λ     λ   normal-¯  λ              superscript  a  2     a  b     superscript  b  2       \mathrm{N}\lambda=\lambda\overline{\lambda}=a^{2}-ab+b^{2}.   From the definition, if λ and μ are two Eisenstein integers, Nλμ = Nλ Nμ; in other words, the norm is a completely multiplicative function . The norm of zero is zero, the norm of any other number is a positive integer. ε is a unit if and only if Nε = 1. Note that the norm is always ≡ 0 or ≡ 1 (mod 3).  Z [ω] is a unique factorization domain . The primes fall into three classes: 37   3 is a special case: 3 = −ω 2 (1 − ω) 2 . It is the only prime in Z divisible by the square of a prime in Z [ω]. In algebraic number theory, 3 is said to ramify in Z [ω].    Positive primes in Z ≡ 2 (mod 3) are also primes in Z [ω]. In algebraic number theory, these primes are said to remain inert in Z [ω].    Positive primes in Z ≡ 1 (mod 3) are the product of two conjugate primes in Z [ω].    p  =   N  π   =   N   π  ¯    =   π   π  ¯          p    normal-N  π          normal-N   normal-¯  π           π   normal-¯  π       p=\mathrm{N}\pi=\mathrm{N}\overline{\pi}=\pi\overline{\pi}   In algebraic number theory, these primes are said to split in Z [ω].   Thus, inert primes are 2, 5, 11, 17, ... and a factorization of the split primes is   7 = (3 + ω) × (2 − ω),  13 = (4 + ω) × (3 − ω),  19 = (3 − 2ω) × (5 + 2ω),  31 = (1 + 6ω) × (−5 − 6ω), ...   The associates and conjugate of a prime are also primes.  Note that the norm of an inert prime q is N q = q 2 ≡ 1 (mod 3).  In order to state the unique factorization theorem, it is necessary to have a way of distinguishing one of the associates of a number. Eisenstein defines 38 a number to be primary if it is ≡ 2 (mod 3). It is straightforward to show that if gcd(Nλ, 3) = 1 then exactly one associate of λ is primary. A disadvantage of this definition is that the product of two primary numbers is the negative of a primary.  Most modern authors 39 40 say that a number is primary if it is coprime to 3 and congruent to an ordinary integer (mod (1 − ω) 2 ), which is the same as saying it is ≡ ±2 (mod 3). There are two reasons to do this: first, the product of two primaries is a primary, and second, it generalizes to all cyclotomic number fields. 41 Under this definition, if gcd(Nλ, 3) = 1 one of λ, ωλ, or ω 2 λ is primary. A primary under Eisenstein's definition is primary under the modern one, and if λ is primary under the modern one, either λ or −λ is primary under Eisenstein's. Since −1 is a cube, this does not affect the statement of cubic reciprocity, but it does affect the unique factorization theorem. This article uses the modern definition, so  The product of two primary numbers is primary and the conjugate of a primary number is also primary.  The unique factorization theorem for Z [ω] is: if λ ≠ 0, then      λ  =   ±    ω  μ     (   1  -  ω   )   ν    π  1   α  1     π  2   α  2     π  3   α  3    …        λ   plus-or-minus     superscript  ω  μ    superscript    1  ω   ν    superscript   subscript  π  1    subscript  α  1     superscript   subscript  π  2    subscript  α  2     superscript   subscript  π  3    subscript  α  3    normal-…      \lambda=\pm\omega^{\mu}(1-\omega)^{\nu}\pi_{1}^{\alpha_{1}}\pi_{2}^{\alpha_{2}%
 }\pi_{3}^{\alpha_{3}}\dots   where   0 ≤ μ ≤ 2,   ν ≥ 0,   each π i is a primary (under Eisenstein's definition) prime, and each α i ≥ 1, and this representation is unique, up to the order of the factors.  The notions of congruence 42 and greatest common divisor 43 are defined the same way in Z [ω] as they are for the ordinary integers Z . Because the units divide all numbers, a congruence (mod λ) is also true modulo any associate of λ, and any associate of a GCD is also a GCD.  Cubic residue character  An analogue of Fermat's little theorem is true in Z [ω]: if α is not divisible by a prime π, 44       α    N  π   -  1    ≡   1     (   mod  π   )         superscript  α      normal-N  π   1     annotated  1   pmod  π      \alpha^{\mathrm{N}\pi-1}\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}\pi)     Now assume that Nπ ≠ 3, so that Nπ ≡ 1 (mod 3).  Then    α     N  π   -  1   3      superscript  α        normal-N  π   1   3     \alpha^{\frac{\mathrm{N}\pi-1}{3}}   makes sense, and     α     N  π   -  1   3    ≡    ω  k      (   mod  π   )         superscript  α        normal-N  π   1   3     annotated   superscript  ω  k    pmod  π      \alpha^{\frac{\mathrm{N}\pi-1}{3}}\equiv\omega^{k}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}\pi)   for a unique unit ω k .  This unit is called the cubic residue character of α (mod π) and is denoted by 45         (   α  π   )   3   =   ω  k   ≡    α     N  π   -  1   3       (   mod  π   )     .         subscript    α  π   3    superscript  ω  k         annotated   superscript  α        normal-N  π   1   3     pmod  π       \left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)_{3}=\omega^{k}\equiv\alpha^{\frac{\mathrm{N}%
 \pi-1}{3}}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}\pi).     It has formal properties similar to those of the Legendre symbol . 46   The congruence     x  3   ≡   α     (   mod  π   )         superscript  x  3    annotated  α   pmod  π      x^{3}\equiv\alpha\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}\pi)   is solvable in Z [ω] if and only if      (   α  π   )   3   =  1.       subscript    α  π   3   1.    \left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)_{3}=1.    47          (    α  β   π   )   3   =     (   α  π   )   3     (   β  π   )   3         subscript      α  β   π   3      subscript    α  π   3    subscript    β  π   3      \Bigg(\frac{\alpha\beta}{\pi}\Bigg)_{3}=\Bigg(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\Bigg)_{3}%

 \overline{\pi}}\Bigg)_{3}   where the bar denotes complex conjugation.   if π and θ are associates,      (   α  π   )   3   =    (   α  θ   )   3        subscript    α  π   3    subscript    α  θ   3     \Bigg(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\Bigg)_{3}=\Bigg(\frac{\alpha}{\theta}\Bigg)_{3}       if α ≡ β (mod π),      (   α  π   )   3   =    (   β  π   )   3        subscript    α  π   3    subscript    β  π   3     \Bigg(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\Bigg)_{3}=\Bigg(\frac{\beta}{\pi}\Bigg)_{3}      The cubic character can be extended multiplicatively to composite numbers (coprime to 3) in the "denominator" in the same way the Legendre symbol is generalized into the Jacobi symbol . Like the Jacobi symbol, if the "denominator" of the cubic character is composite, then if the "numerator" is a cubic residue mod the "denominator" the symbol will equal 1, if the symbol does not equal 1 then the "numerator" is a cubic nonresidue, but the symbol can equal 1 when the "numerator" is a nonresidue:        (   α  λ   )   3   =     (   α   π  1    )   3   α  1      (   α   π  2    )   3   α  2    …        subscript    α  λ   3      superscript   subscript    α   subscript  π  1    3    subscript  α  1     superscript   subscript    α   subscript  π  2    3    subscript  α  2    normal-…     \left(\frac{\alpha}{\lambda}\right)_{3}=\left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi_{1}}\right)_{3%

Statement of the theorem  Let α and β be primary. Then         (   α  β   )   3   =    (   β  α   )   3    .       subscript    α  β   3    subscript    β  α   3     \Bigg(\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\Bigg)_{3}=\Bigg(\frac{\beta}{\alpha}\Bigg)_{3}.     There are supplementary theorems 50 51 for the units and the prime 1 − ω:  Let α = a + b ω be primary, a = 3 m + 1 and b = 3 n . (If a ≡ 2 (mod 3) replace α with its associate −α; this will not change the value of the cubic characters.)
