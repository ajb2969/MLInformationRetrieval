   Pentagonal pyramid      Pentagonal pyramid   In geometry , a pentagonal pyramid is a pyramid with a pentagonal base upon which are erected five triangular faces that meet at a point (the vertex). Like any pyramid , it is self- dual .  The regular pentagonal pyramid has a base that is a regular pentagon and lateral faces that are equilateral triangles . It is one of the Johnson solids ( J 2 ). Its height H , from the midpoint of the pentagonal face to the apex, (as a function of a , where a is the side length), can be computed as:       H  =       5  -   5    10     a   ≈    0.5257   a    .        H          5    5    10    a          0.5257  a      H=\sqrt{{\frac{5-\sqrt{5}}{10}}}\,a\approx 0.5257\,a.   Its surface area, A , can be computed as the area of pentagonal base plus five times the area of one triangle:       A  =    (      25  +   10   5      4   +   5    3   4     )    a  2    ≈    3.8855    a  2     .        A            25    10    5      4     5      3   4      superscript  a  2           3.8855   superscript  a  2       A=\left(\frac{\sqrt{25+10\sqrt{5}}}{4}+5\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)a^{2}\approx 3%
 .8855\,a^{2}.   Its volume when an edge length is known can be figured out with this formula:       V  =      5  +   5    24     a  3    ≈    0.3015    a  3     .        V        5    5    24    superscript  a  3           0.3015   superscript  a  3       V=\frac{5+\sqrt{5}}{24}\,a^{3}\approx 0.3015\,a^{3}.     It can be seen as the "lid" of an icosahedron ; the rest of the icosahedron forms a gyroelongated pentagonal pyramid , J 11 , one of the 92 Johnson solids named and described by Norman Johnson in 1966.  More generally an order-2 vertex-uniform pentagonal pyramid can be defined with a regular pentagonal base and 5 isosceles triangle sides of any height.

The dual edge lengths are different due to the polar reciprocation .
