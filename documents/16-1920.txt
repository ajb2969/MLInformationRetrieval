   Draft:Distributions on an algebraic group      Draft:Distributions on an algebraic group   The algebra of distributions on an algebraic group  G , denoted by Dist( G ), generalizes Lie( G ), the Lie algebra associated to G . Over a field of characteristic zero, it is isomorphic to the enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of G and thus gives no new information. In the positive characteristic case, it can be used as a substitute for the Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence and its variant for algebraic groups in the characteristic zero.  Definition  Let X = Spec A be an affine scheme over a field k and let I x be the kernel of the restriction map    A  →   k   (  x  )       normal-→  A    k  x     A\to k(x)   , the residue field of x . By definition, a ''distribution f supported at x '' is a k -linear functional on A such that     f   (   I  x  n   )    =  0        f   superscript   subscript  I  x   n    0    f(I_{x}^{n})=0   for some n . (Note: the definition is still valid if k is an arbitrary ring.)  Now, if G is an algebraic group over k , we let Dist( G ) be the set of all distributions on G supported at the identity element. If f , g are in it, we define the product of f and g , demoted by f * g , to be the linear functional          k   [  G  ]    →  Δ   k   [  G  ]    ⊗  k    [  G  ]    →   f  ⊗  g    k   ⊗  k   =  k       tensor-product     tensor-product    k   delimited-[]  G    normal-Δ  normal-→   k   delimited-[]  G    k    delimited-[]  G     tensor-product  f  g   normal-→   k   k   k    k[G]\overset{\Delta}{\to}k[G]\otimes k[G]\overset{f\otimes g}{\to}k\otimes k=k   where Δ is the comultiplication that is the homomorphism induced by the multiplication     G  ×  G   →  G     normal-→    G  G   G    G\times G\to G   . The multiplication turns out to be associative (use      1  ⊗  Δ   ∘  Δ   =    Δ  ⊗  1   ∘  Δ          tensor-product  1  normal-Δ   normal-Δ      tensor-product  normal-Δ  1   normal-Δ     1\otimes\Delta\circ\Delta=\Delta\otimes 1\circ\Delta   ) and thus Dist( G ) is an associative algebra, as the set is closed under the muplication by the formula:   (*)     Δ   (   I  1  n   )    ⊂    ∑   r  =  0   n     I  1  r   ⊗   I  1   n  -  r            normal-Δ   superscript   subscript  I  1   n      superscript   subscript     r  0    n    tensor-product   superscript   subscript  I  1   r    subscript   superscript  I    n  r    1       \Delta(I_{1}^{n})\subset\sum_{r=0}^{n}I_{1}^{r}\otimes I^{n-r}_{1}   .   It is also unital with the unity that is the linear functional      k   [  G  ]    →  k   ,   ϕ  ↦   ϕ   (  1  )        formulae-sequence   normal-→    k   delimited-[]  G    k    maps-to  ϕ    ϕ  1      k[G]\to k,\phi\mapsto\phi(1)   , the Dirac's delta measure .  The Lie algebra Lie( G ) sits inside Dist( G ). Indeed, by definition, Lie( G ) is the tangent space to G at the identity element 1; i.e., the dual space of     I  1   /   I  1  2        subscript  I  1    superscript   subscript  I  1   2     I_{1}/I_{1}^{2}   . Thus, a tangent vector amounts to a linear functional on I 1 that has no constant term and kills the square of I 1 and the formula (*) implies     [  f  ,  g  ]   =    f  *  g   -   g  *  f         f  g       f  g     g  f      [f,g]=f*g-g*f   is still a tangent vector.  Let    𝔤  =   Lie   (  G  )        𝔤   Lie  G     \mathfrak{g}=\operatorname{Lie}(G)   be the Lie algebra of G . Then, by the universal property, the inclusion    𝔤  ↪   Dist   (  G  )       normal-↪  𝔤   Dist  G     \mathfrak{g}\hookrightarrow\operatorname{Dist}(G)   induces the algebra homomorphism:       U   (  𝔤  )    →   Dist   (  G  )       normal-→    U  𝔤    Dist  G     U(\mathfrak{g})\to\operatorname{Dist}(G)   . When the base field k has characteristic zero, this homomorphism is an isomorphism. 1  Examples  Additive group  Let    G  =   𝔾  a       G   subscript  𝔾  a     G=\mathbb{G}_{a}   be the additive group; i.e., G ( R ) = R for any k -algebra R . As a variety G is the affine line; i.e., the coordinate ring is k [ t ] and I 0 n = ( t n ).  Multiplicative group  Let    G  =   𝔾  m       G   subscript  𝔾  m     G=\mathbb{G}_{m}   be the multiplicative group; i.e., G ( R ) = R * for any k -algebra R . The coordinate ring of G is k [ t , t -1 ] (since G is really GL 1 ( k ).)  Correspondence   For any closed subgroups H , 'K of G , if k is perfect and H is irreducible, then          H  ⊂  K   ⇔    Dist   (  H  )    ⊂   Dist   (  K  )        normal-⇔    H  K      Dist  H    Dist  K      H\subset K\Leftrightarrow\operatorname{Dist}(H)\subset\operatorname{Dist}(K)   .      If V is a G -module (that is a representation of G ), then it admits a natural structure of Dist( G )-module, which in turns gives the module structure over   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   .  Any action G on an affine algebraic variety  X induces the representation of G on the coordinate ring k [ G ]. In particular, the conjugation action of G induces the action of G on k [ G ]. One can show I 1 n is stable under G and thus G acts on ( k [ G ]/ I 1 n ) * and whence on its union Dist( G ). The resulting action is called the adjoint action of G .   The case of finite algebraic groups  Let G be an algebraic group that is "finite" as a group scheme ; for example, any finite group may be viewed as a finite algebraic group. There is an equivalence of categories between the category of finite algebraic groups and the category of finite-dimensional cocommutative Hopf algebras given by mapping G to k [ G ] * , the dual of the coordinate ring of G . Note that Dist( G ) is a (Hopf) subalgebra of k [ G ] * .  Notes  References   J. C.
