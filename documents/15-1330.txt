(Phosphatase 2A protein)-leucine-carboxy methyltransferase

(phosphatase 2A protein)-leucine-carboxy methyltransferase (, leucine carboxy methyltransferase-1, LCMT1) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:(phosphatase 2A protein)-leucine O-methyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + [phosphatase 2A protein]-leucine 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + [phosphatase 2A protein]-leucine methyl ester
 

Methylates the C-terminal leucine of phosphatase 2A.
