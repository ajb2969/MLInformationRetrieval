   Cobalt-factor II C20-methyltransferase      Cobalt-factor II C20-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a cobalt-factor II C20-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cobalt-factor II   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + cobalt-factor III   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and cobalt-factor II , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and cobalt-factor III .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:cobalt-factor-II C20-methyltransferase . This enzyme is also called CbiL . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
