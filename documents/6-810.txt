Perfect ruler

A perfect ruler of length 
 
 
 
  is a ruler with a subset of the integer markings 
 
 
 
  that appear on a regular ruler. The defining criterion of this subset is that there exists an 
 
 
 
  such that any positive integer

 
  can be expressed uniquely as a difference

 
  for some 
 
 
 
 . This is referred to as an 
 
 
 
 -perfect ruler.
A 4-perfect ruler of length 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 . To verify this, we need to show that every number 
 
 
 
  can be expressed as a difference of two numbers in the above set:












An optimal perfect ruler is one where for a fixed value of 
 
 
 
  the value of 
 
 
 
  is minimized.
