UDP-D-xylose:beta-D-glucoside alpha-1,3-D-xylosyltransferase

UDP-D-xylose:beta-D-glucoside alpha-1,3-D-xylosyltransferase (, beta-glucoside alpha-1,3-xylosyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name UDP-alpha-D-xylose:beta-D-glucoside 3-alpha-D-xylosyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

UDP-alpha-D-xylose + Glcbeta-Ser53-EGF-like domain of bovine factor IX(45-87) 
 
 
 
  UDP + Xylalpha(1-3)Glcbeta-Ser53-EGF-like domain of bovine factor IX(45-87)
 

The enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of the Xylalpha(1-3)Xylalpha(1-3)Glcbeta-1-O-Ser on epidermal growth factor-like domains.
