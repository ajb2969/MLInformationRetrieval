   4-oxoproline reductase      4-oxoproline reductase   In enzymology , a 4-oxoproline reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-hydroxy-L-proline + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-oxoproline + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-hydroxy-L-proline and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 4-oxoproline , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxy-L-proline:NAD + oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called hydroxy-L-proline oxidase . This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
