   Choi–Williams distribution function      Choi–Williams distribution function   Choi–Williams distribution function is one of the members of Cohen's class distribution function . It was first proposed by Hyung-Ill Choi and William J. Williams in 1989. This distribution function adopts exponential kernel to suppress the cross-term. However, the kernel gain does not decrease along the    η  ,  τ     η  τ    \eta,\tau   axes in the ambiguity domain. Consequently, the kernel function of Choi–Williams distribution function can only filter out the cross-terms that result from the components that differ in both time and frequency center.  Mathematical definition  The definition of the cone-shape distribution function is shown as follows:         C  x    (  t  ,  f  )    =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞     ∫   -  ∞   ∞     A  x    (  η  ,  τ  )   Φ   (  η  ,  τ  )    exp   (   j  2  π   (    η  t   -   τ  f    )    )    d   η   d  τ      ,         subscript  C  x    t  f      superscript   subscript            superscript   subscript             subscript  A  x    η  τ   normal-Φ   η  τ       j  2  π      η  t     τ  f      d  η  d  τ       C_{x}(t,f)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}A_{x}(\eta,\tau)\Phi(%
 \eta,\tau)\exp(j2\pi(\eta t-\tau f))\,d\eta\,d\tau,     where         A  x    (  η  ,  τ  )    =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞    x   (   t  +   τ  /  2    )    x  *    (   t  -   τ  /  2    )     e   -   j  2  π  t  η      d  t     ,         subscript  A  x    η  τ      superscript   subscript            x    t    τ  2     superscript  x      t    τ  2     superscript  e      j  2  π  t  η     d  t      A_{x}(\eta,\tau)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x(t+\tau/2)x^{*}(t-\tau/2)e^{-j2\pi t%
 \eta}\,dt,     and the kernel function is:        Φ   (  η  ,  τ  )    =   exp   [   -   α    (   η  τ   )   2     ]     .        normal-Φ   η  τ          α   superscript    η  τ   2        \Phi\left(\eta,\tau\right)=\exp\left[-\alpha\left(\eta\tau\right)^{2}\right].     Following are the magnitude distribution of the kernel function in    η  ,  τ     η  τ    \eta,\tau   domain with different   α   α   \alpha   values.  As we can see from the figure above, the kernel function indeed suppress the interference which is away from the origin, but for the cross-term locates on the   η   η   \eta   and   τ   τ   \tau   axes, this kernel function can do nothing about it.
