2-coumarate reductase

In enzymology, a 2-coumarate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-(2-hydroxyphenyl)propanoate + NAD+

 
  2-coumarate + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-(2-hydroxyphenyl)propanoate and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are 2-coumarate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-(2-hydroxyphenyl)propanoate:NAD+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called melilotate dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in phenylalanine metabolism.
