4,4'-Diapophytoene synthase

4,4'-diapophytoene synthase (, dehydrosqualene synthase, DAP synthase, C30 carotene synthase, CrtM) is an enzyme with system name farnesyl-diphosphate:farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase (4,4'-diapophytoene forming).1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2 (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  4,4'-diapophytoene + 2 diphosphate (overall reaction)
 
(1a) 2 (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
diphosphate + presqualene diphosphate
 
(1b) presqualene diphosphate

 
  4,4'-diapophytoene + diphosphate
 

This enzym requires Mn2+. It is preset in Staphylococcus aureus and some other bacteria such as Heliobacillus sp.
