   4,4'-Diapophytoene synthase      4,4'-Diapophytoene synthase   4,4'-diapophytoene synthase (, dehydrosqualene synthase , DAP synthase , C30 carotene synthase , CrtM ) is an enzyme with system name farnesyl-diphosphate:farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase (4,4'-diapophytoene forming) . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2 (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4,4'-diapophytoene + 2 diphosphate (overall reaction)  (1a) 2 (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    diphosphate + presqualene diphosphate  (1b) presqualene diphosphate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4,4'-diapophytoene + diphosphate   This enzym requires Mn 2+ . It is preset in Staphylococcus aureus and some other bacteria such as Heliobacillus sp .  References  External links     "  Category:EC 2.5.1     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
