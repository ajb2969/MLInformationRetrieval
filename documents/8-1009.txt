   Cameron–Martin theorem      Cameron–Martin theorem   In mathematics , the Cameron–Martin theorem or Cameron–Martin formula (named after Robert Horton Cameron and W. T. Martin ) is a theorem of measure theory that describes how abstract Wiener measure changes under translation by certain elements of the Cameron–Martin Hilbert space .  Motivation  The standard Gaussian measure γ n on n -dimensional Euclidean space  R n is not translation- invariant . (In fact, there is a unique translation invariant Radon measure up to scale by Haar's theorem : the n -dimensional Lebesgue measure , denoted here dx .) Instead, a measurable subset A has Gaussian measure         γ  n    (  A  )    =    1    (   2  π   )    n  /  2       ∫  A     exp   (   -     1  2      ⟨  x  ,  x  ⟩    𝐑  n      )    d  x      .         subscript  γ  n   A       1   superscript    2  π     n  2       subscript   A             1  2    subscript   x  x    superscript  𝐑  n       d  x       \gamma_{n}(A)=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n/2}}\int_{A}\exp\left(-\tfrac{1}{2}\langle x,x%
 \rangle_{\mathbf{R}^{n}}\right)\,dx.     Here     ⟨  x  ,  x  ⟩    𝐑  n      subscript   x  x    superscript  𝐑  n     \langle x,x\rangle_{\mathbf{R}^{n}}   refers to the standard Euclidean dot product in R n . The Gaussian measure of the translation of A by a vector h ∈ R n is       γ  n    (   A  -  h   )        subscript  γ  n     A  h     \displaystyle\gamma_{n}(A-h)     So under translation through h , the Gaussian measure scales by the distribution function appearing in the last display:        exp   (     2    ⟨  x  ,  h  ⟩    𝐑  n     -    ⟨  h  ,  h  ⟩    𝐑  n     2   )    =   exp   (     ⟨  x  ,  h  ⟩    𝐑  n    -     1  2      ∥  h  ∥    𝐑  n   2     )     .              2   subscript   x  h    superscript  𝐑  n      subscript   h  h    superscript  𝐑  n     2         subscript   x  h    superscript  𝐑  n        1  2    superscript   subscript   norm  h    superscript  𝐑  n    2        \exp\left(\frac{2\langle x,h\rangle_{\mathbf{R}^{n}}-\langle h,h\rangle_{%
 \mathbf{R}^{n}}}{2}\right)=\exp\left(\langle x,h\rangle_{\mathbf{R}^{n}}-%
 \tfrac{1}{2}\|h\|_{\mathbf{R}^{n}}^{2}\right).     The measure that associates to the set A the number γ n ( A − h ) is the pushforward measure , denoted ( T h ) ∗ (γ n ). Here T h : R n → R n refers to the translation map: T h ( x ) = x + h .. The above calculation shows that the Radon–Nikodym derivative of the pushforward measure with respect to the original Gaussian measure is given by          d    (   T  h   )   *    (   γ  n   )     d   γ  n      (  x  )    =   exp   (     ⟨  h  ,  x  ⟩    𝐑  n    -     1  2      ∥  h  ∥    𝐑  n   2     )     .            normal-d   subscript   subscript  T  h      superscript  γ  n      normal-d   superscript  γ  n     x        subscript   h  x    superscript  𝐑  n        1  2    superscript   subscript   norm  h    superscript  𝐑  n    2        \frac{\mathrm{d}(T_{h})_{*}(\gamma^{n})}{\mathrm{d}\gamma^{n}}(x)=\exp\left(%
 \left\langle h,x\right\rangle_{\mathbf{R}^{n}}-\tfrac{1}{2}\|h\|_{\mathbf{R}^{%
 n}}^{2}\right).     Abstract Wiener measure γ on a separable  Banach space  E , where i : H → E is an abstract Wiener space, is also a "Gaussian measure" in a suitable sense. How does it change under translation? It turns out that a similar formula to the one above holds if we consider only translations by elements of the dense  subspace  i ( H ) ⊆ E .  Statement of the theorem  Let i : H → E be an abstract Wiener space with abstract Wiener measure γ : Borel( E ) → [0, 1]. For h ∈ H , define T h : E → E by T h ( x ) = x + i ( h ). Then ( T h ) ∗ (γ) is equivalent to γ with Radon–Nikodym derivative          d    (   T  h   )   *    (  γ  )     d  γ     (  x  )    =   exp   (     ⟨  h  ,  x  ⟩   ∼   -     1  2      ∥  h  ∥   H  2     )     ,            normal-d   subscript   subscript  T  h     γ     normal-d  γ    x        superscript   h  x   similar-to       1  2    superscript   subscript   norm  h   H   2        \frac{\mathrm{d}(T_{h})_{*}(\gamma)}{\mathrm{d}\gamma}(x)=\exp\left(\langle h,%
 x\rangle^{\sim}-\tfrac{1}{2}\|h\|_{H}^{2}\right),     where        ⟨  h  ,  x  ⟩   ∼   =   I   (  h  )    (  x  )         superscript   h  x   similar-to     I  h  x     \langle h,x\rangle^{\sim}=I(h)(x)     denotes the Paley–Wiener integral .  The Cameron–Martin formula is valid only for translations by elements of the dense subspace i ( H ) ⊆ E , called Cameron–Martin space , and not by arbitrary elements of E . If the Cameron–Martin formula did hold for arbitrary translations, it would contradict the following result:   If E is a separable Banach space and μ is a locally finite Borel measure on E that is equivalent to its own push forward under any translation, then either E has finite dimension or μ is the trivial (zero) measure . (See quasi-invariant measure .)   In fact, γ is quasi-invariant under translation by an element v  if and only if  v ∈ i ( H ). Vectors in i ( H ) are sometimes known as Cameron–Martin directions .  Integration by parts  The Cameron–Martin formula gives rise to an integration by parts formula on E : if F : E → R has bounded  Fréchet derivative D F : E → Lin( E ; R ) = E ∗ , integrating the Cameron–Martin formula with respect to Wiener measure on both sides gives        ∫  E    F   (   x  +   t  i   (  h  )     )   d  γ   (  x  )     =    ∫  E    F   (  x  )    exp   (    t    ⟨  h  ,  x  ⟩   ∼    -     1  2     t  2     ∥  h  ∥   H  2     )    d  γ   (  x  )           subscript   E     F    x    t  i  h    normal-d  γ  x      subscript   E     F  x        t   superscript   h  x   similar-to        1  2    superscript  t  2    superscript   subscript   norm  h   H   2      normal-d  γ  x      \int_{E}F(x+ti(h))\,\mathrm{d}\gamma(x)=\int_{E}F(x)\exp\left(t\langle h,x%
 \rangle^{\sim}-\tfrac{1}{2}t^{2}\|h\|_{H}^{2}\right)\,\mathrm{d}\gamma(x)     for any t ∈ R . Formally differentiating with respect to t and evaluating at t = 0 gives the integration by parts formula         ∫  E    D  F   (  x  )    (   i   (  h  )    )   d  γ   (  x  )     =    ∫  E    F   (  x  )      ⟨  h  ,  x  ⟩   ∼    d  γ   (  x  )      .        subscript   E     normal-D  F  x    i  h   normal-d  γ  x      subscript   E     F  x   superscript   h  x   similar-to   normal-d  γ  x      \int_{E}\mathrm{D}F(x)(i(h))\,\mathrm{d}\gamma(x)=\int_{E}F(x)\langle h,x%
 \rangle^{\sim}\,\mathrm{d}\gamma(x).     Comparison with the divergence theorem of vector calculus suggests        div    [   V  h   ]    (  x  )     =   -    ⟨  h  ,  x  ⟩   ∼     ,       div     delimited-[]   subscript  V  h    x       superscript   h  x   similar-to      \mathop{\mathrm{div}}[V_{h}](x)=-\langle h,x\rangle^{\sim},     where V h : E → E is the constant " vector field " V h ( x ) = i ( h ) for all x ∈ E . The wish to consider more general vector fields and to think of stochastic integrals as "divergences" leads to the study of stochastic processes and the Malliavin calculus , and, in particular, the Clark–Ocone theorem and its associated integration by parts formula.  An application  Using Cameron–Martin theorem one may establish (See Liptser and Shiryayev 1977, p. 280) that for a q × q symmetric non-negative definite matrix, H ( t ) whose elements H j,k ( t ) are continuous and satisfy the condition         ∫  0  1     ∑    j  ,  k   =  1   q     |    H   j  ,  k     (  t  )    |   d  t     <  ∞   ,        superscript   subscript   0   1     superscript   subscript      j  k   1    q          subscript  H   j  k    t    d  t        \int_{0}^{1}\sum_{j,k=1}^{q}|H_{j,k}(t)|\,dt<\infty,     it holds for a q −dimensional Wiener process w ( t ) that        E   [   exp   (   -    ∫  0  1     w  ′    (  t  )   H   (  t  )   w   (  t  )   d  t     )    ]    =   exp   [     1  2      ∫  0  1     tr   (   G   (  t  )    )     d  t      ]     ,        E   delimited-[]        superscript   subscript   0   1      superscript  w  normal-′   t  H  t  w  t  d  t              1  2     superscript   subscript   0   1     tr    G  t      d  t         E\left[\exp\left(-\int_{0}^{1}w^{\prime}(t)H(t)w(t)\,dt\right)\right]=\exp%
 \left[\tfrac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{1}\operatorname{tr}(G(t))\,dt\right],     where G ( t ) is a q × q nonpositive definite matrix which is a unique solution of the matrix-valued Riccati differential equation         d  G   (  t  )     d  t    =    2  H   (  t  )    -    G  2    (  t  )      .          d  G  t     d  t        2  H  t      superscript  G  2   t      \frac{dG(t)}{dt}=2H(t)-G^{2}(t).
