   Simplicial presheaf      Simplicial presheaf   In mathematics, more specifically in homotopy theory , a simplicial presheaf is a presheaf on a site (e.g., the category of topological spaces ) taking values in simplicial sets (i.e., a contravariant functor from the site to the category of simplicial sets). Equivalently, a simplicial presheaf is a simplicial object in the category of presheaves on a site. The notion was introduced by A. Joyal in the 1970s. 1 Similarly, a simplicial sheaf on a site is a simplicial object in the category of sheaves on the site. 2  Example: Let us consider, say, the √©tale site of a scheme S . Each U in the site represents the presheaf    Hom   (  -  ,  U  )      Hom   U    \operatorname{Hom}(-,U)   . Thus, a simplicial scheme , a simplicial object in the site, represents a simplicial presheaf (in fact, often a simplicial sheaf).  Example: Let G be a presheaf of groupoids. Then taking nerves section-wise, one obtains a simplicial presheaf    B  G      B  G    BG   . For example, one might set     B  GL   =    lim  ‚Üí    B   GL  n           B  GL    injective-limit    B   subscript  GL  normal-n       B\operatorname{GL}=\underrightarrow{\lim}B\operatorname{GL_{n}}   . These types of examples appear in K-theory.  If    f  :   X  ‚Üí  Y      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  X  Y     f:X\to Y   is a local weak equivalence of simplicial presheaves, then the induced map     ‚Ñ§  f   :    ‚Ñ§  X   ‚Üí   ‚Ñ§  Y       normal-:    ‚Ñ§  f    normal-‚Üí    ‚Ñ§  X     ‚Ñ§  Y      \mathbb{Z}f:\mathbb{Z}X\to\mathbb{Z}Y   is also a local weak equivalence.  Homotopy sheaves of a simplicial presheaf  Let F be a simplicial presheaf on a site. The homotopy sheaves      œÄ  *   F       subscript  œÄ    F    \pi_{*}F   of F is defined as follows. For any    f  :   X  ‚Üí  Y      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  X  Y     f:X\to Y   in the site and a 0-simplex s in F ( X ), set      (    œÄ  0  pr   F   )    (  X  )    =    œÄ  0    (   F   (  X  )    )             superscript   subscript  œÄ  0   pr   F   X      subscript  œÄ  0     F  X      (\pi_{0}^{\text{pr}}F)(X)=\pi_{0}(F(X))   and      (    œÄ  i  pr    (  F  ,  s  )    )    (  f  )    =    œÄ  i    (   F   (  Y  )    ,    f  *    (  s  )    )             superscript   subscript  œÄ  i   pr    F  s    f      subscript  œÄ  i      F  Y      superscript  f    s       (\pi_{i}^{\text{pr}}(F,s))(f)=\pi_{i}(F(Y),f^{*}(s))   . We then set     œÄ  i   F       subscript  œÄ  i   F    \pi_{i}F   to be the sheaf associated with the pre-sheaf     œÄ  i  pr   F       superscript   subscript  œÄ  i   pr   F    \pi_{i}^{\text{pr}}F   .  Model structures  The category of simplicial presheaves on a site admits many different model structures .  Some of them are obtained by viewing simplicial presheaves as functors       S   o  p    ‚Üí    Œî   o  p    S  e  t  s      normal-‚Üí   superscript  S    o  p       superscript  normal-Œî    o  p    S  e  t  s     S^{op}\to\Delta^{op}Sets   The category of such functors is endowed with (at least) three model structures, namely the projective, the Reedy, and the injective model structure. The weak equivalences / fibrations in the first are maps      ‚Ñ±  ‚Üí  ùí¢     normal-‚Üí  ‚Ñ±  ùí¢    \mathcal{F}\to\mathcal{G}   such that       ‚Ñ±   (  U  )    ‚Üí   ùí¢   (  U  )       normal-‚Üí    ‚Ñ±  U     ùí¢  U     \mathcal{F}(U)\to\mathcal{G}(U)   is a weak equivalence / fibration of simplicial sets, for all U in the site S . The injective model structure is similar, but with weak equivalences and cofibrations instead.  Stack  A simplicial presheaf F on a site is called a stack if, for any X and any hypercovering H ‚Üí X , the canonical map       F   (  X  )    ‚Üí    holim  F    (   H  n   )       normal-‚Üí    F  X      holim  F    subscript  H  n      F(X)\to\operatorname{holim}F(H_{n})   is a weak equivalence as simplicial sets, where the right is the homotopy limit of       [  n  ]   =   {  0  ,  1  ,  ‚Ä¶  ,  n  }   ‚Ü¶   F   (   H  n   )           delimited-[]  n    0  1  normal-‚Ä¶  n     maps-to      F   subscript  H  n       [n]=\{0,1,\dots,n\}\mapsto F(H_{n})   .  Any sheaf F on the site can be considered as a stack by viewing    F   (  X  )       F  X    F(X)   as a constant simplicial set; this way, the category of sheaves on the site is included as a subcategory to the homotopy category of simplicial presheaves on the site. The inclusion functor has a left adjoint and that is exactly    F  ‚Ü¶    œÄ  0   F      maps-to  F     subscript  œÄ  0   F     F\mapsto\pi_{0}F   .  If A is a sheaf of abelian group (on the same site), then we define    K   (  A  ,  1  )       K   A  1     K(A,1)   by doing classifying space construction levelwise (the notion comes from the obstruction theory ) and set     K   (  A  ,  i  )    =   K   (   K   (  A  ,   i  -  1   )    ,  1  )          K   A  i      K     K   A    i  1     1      K(A,i)=K(K(A,i-1),1)   . One can show (by induction): for any X in the site,        H  i    (  X  ;  A  )    =   [  X  ,   K   (  A  ,  i  )    ]         superscript  normal-H  i   X  A    X    K   A  i       \operatorname{H}^{i}(X;A)=[X,K(A,i)]   where the left denotes a sheaf cohomology and the right the homotopy class of maps.
