   Hypertopology      Hypertopology   In the mathematical branch of topology , a hyperspace (or a space equipped with a hypertopology) is a topological space , which consists of the set CL(X) of all closed subsets of another topological space X , equipped with a topology so that the canonical map       i  :   x  ↦    {  x  }   ¯     ,     normal-:  i   maps-to  x   normal-¯   x       i:x\mapsto\overline{\{x\}},     is a homeomorphism onto its image. As a consequence, a copy of the original space X lives inside hyperspace CL(X) . 1  2  Early examples of hypertopology include the Hausdorff metric 3 and Vietoris topology . 4  References  External links   Comparison of Hypertopologies  Hyperspacewiki   "  Category:Topology     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
