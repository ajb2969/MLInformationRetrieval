Hypertopology

In the mathematical branch of topology, a hyperspace (or a space equipped with a hypertopology) is a topological space, which consists of the set CL(X) of all closed subsets of another topological space X, equipped with a topology so that the canonical map



is a homeomorphism onto its image. As a consequence, a copy of the original space X lives inside hyperspace CL(X). 1 2
Early examples of hypertopology include the Hausdorff metric3 and Vietoris topology.4
