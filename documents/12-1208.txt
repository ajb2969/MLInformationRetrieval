   Zig-zag lemma      Zig-zag lemma   In mathematics , particularly homological algebra , the zig-zag lemma asserts the existence of a particular long exact sequence in the homology groups of certain chain complexes . The result is valid in every abelian category .  Statement  In an abelian category (such as the category of abelian groups or the category of vector spaces over a given field ), let     (  𝒜  ,   ∂  ∙   )   ,   (  ℬ  ,   ∂  ∙  ′   )       𝒜   subscript   normal-∙     ℬ   superscript   subscript   normal-∙   normal-′      (\mathcal{A},\partial_{\bullet}),(\mathcal{B},\partial_{\bullet}^{\prime})   and    (  𝒞  ,   ∂  ∙  ′′   )     𝒞   superscript   subscript   normal-∙   ′′     (\mathcal{C},\partial_{\bullet}^{\prime\prime})   be chain complexes that fit into the following short exact sequence :      0  ⟶  𝒜   ⟶  α   ℬ   ⟶  β   𝒞  ⟶  0       normal-⟶  0  𝒜     superscript  normal-⟶  α     ℬ     superscript  normal-⟶  β     𝒞    normal-⟶    0     0\longrightarrow\mathcal{A}\stackrel{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}\mathcal{B}%
 \stackrel{\beta}{\longrightarrow}\mathcal{C}\longrightarrow 0     Such a sequence is shorthand for the following commutative diagram :  commutative diagram representation of a short exact sequence of chain complexes  where the rows are exact sequences and each column is a complex .  The zig-zag lemma asserts that there is a collection of boundary maps        δ  n   :     H  n    (  𝒞  )    ⟶    H   n  -  1     (  𝒜  )      ,     normal-:   subscript  δ  n    normal-⟶     subscript  H  n   𝒞      subscript  H    n  1    𝒜      \delta_{n}:H_{n}(\mathcal{C})\longrightarrow H_{n-1}(\mathcal{A}),     that makes the following sequence exact:  long exact sequence in homology, given by the Zig-Zag Lemma  The maps    α  *     subscript  α     \alpha_{*}   and    β  *     subscript  β     \beta_{*}   are the usual maps induced by homology. The boundary maps    δ  n     subscript  δ  n    \delta_{n}   are explained below. The name of the lemma arises from the "zig-zag" behavior of the maps in the sequence. In an unfortunate overlap in terminology, this theorem is also commonly known as the " snake lemma ," although there is another result in homological algebra with that name. Interestingly, the "other" snake lemma can be used to prove the zig-zag lemma, in a manner different from what is described below.  Construction of the boundary maps  The maps    δ  n     subscript  δ  n    \delta_{n}   are defined using a standard diagram chasing argument. Let    c  ∈   C  n       c   subscript  C  n     c\in C_{n}   represent a class in     H  n    (  𝒞  )        subscript  H  n   𝒞    H_{n}(\mathcal{C})   , so      ∂  n  ′′    (  c  )    =  0        superscript   subscript   n   ′′   c   0    \partial_{n}^{\prime\prime}(c)=0   . Exactness of the row implies that    β  n     subscript  β  n    \beta_{n}   is surjective, so there must be some    b  ∈   B  n       b   subscript  B  n     b\in B_{n}   with      β  n    (  b  )    =  c         subscript  β  n   b   c    \beta_{n}(b)=c   . By commutativity of the diagram,        β   n  -  1      ∂  n  ′    (  b  )     =     ∂  n  ′′    β  n     (  b  )    =    ∂  n  ′′    (  c  )    =  0.           subscript  β    n  1      superscript   subscript   n   normal-′   b        superscript   subscript   n   ′′    subscript  β  n    b          superscript   subscript   n   ′′   c        0.     \beta_{n-1}\partial_{n}^{\prime}(b)=\partial_{n}^{\prime\prime}\beta_{n}(b)=%
 \partial_{n}^{\prime\prime}(c)=0.     By exactness,         ∂  n  ′    (  b  )    ∈   ker   β   n  -  1     =   im   α   n  -  1      .          superscript   subscript   n   normal-′   b    kernel   subscript  β    n  1            im   subscript  α    n  1        \partial_{n}^{\prime}(b)\in\ker\beta_{n-1}=\mathrm{im}\alpha_{n-1}.     Thus, since    α   n  -  1      subscript  α    n  1     \alpha_{n-1}   is injective, there is a unique element    a  ∈   A   n  -  1        a   subscript  A    n  1      a\in A_{n-1}   such that      α   n  -  1     (  a  )    =    ∂  n  ′    (  b  )           subscript  α    n  1    a     superscript   subscript   n   normal-′   b     \alpha_{n-1}(a)=\partial_{n}^{\prime}(b)   . This is a cycle, since    α   n  -  2      subscript  α    n  2     \alpha_{n-2}   is injective and         α   n  -  2      ∂   n  -  1     (  a  )     =     ∂   n  -  1   ′    α   n  -  1      (  a  )    =    ∂   n  -  1   ′     ∂  n  ′    (  b  )     =  0   ,           subscript  α    n  2      subscript     n  1    a        superscript   subscript     n  1    normal-′    subscript  α    n  1     a          superscript   subscript     n  1    normal-′     superscript   subscript   n   normal-′   b         0     \alpha_{n-2}\partial_{n-1}(a)=\partial_{n-1}^{\prime}\alpha_{n-1}(a)=\partial_%
 {n-1}^{\prime}\partial_{n}^{\prime}(b)=0,     since     ∂  2   =  0       superscript   2   0    \partial^{2}=0   . That is,      ∂   n  -  1     (  a  )    ∈   ker   α   n  -  2     =   {  0  }           subscript     n  1    a    kernel   subscript  α    n  2           0      \partial_{n-1}(a)\in\ker\alpha_{n-2}=\{0\}   . This means   a   a   a   is a cycle, so it represents a class in     H   n  -  1     (  𝒜  )        subscript  H    n  1    𝒜    H_{n-1}(\mathcal{A})   . We can now define        δ   [  c  ]    =   [  a  ]    .        δ   delimited-[]  c     delimited-[]  a     \delta[c]=[a].\,     With the boundary maps defined, one can show that they are well-defined (that is, independent of the choices of c and b ). The proof uses diagram chasing arguments similar to that above. Such arguments are also used to show that the sequence in homology is exact at each group.
