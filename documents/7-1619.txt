   Taylor KO Factor      Taylor KO Factor   Taylor KO Factor is a formulaic mathematical approach for evaluating the stopping power of hunting cartridges. The term "KO" is an acronym for "Knock Out." The Taylor KO Factor (TKOF) is a derived figure that allows hunters to compare bullets with respect to stopping power . The TKOF was developed by John "Pondoro" Taylor , a famous mid-20th century hunter and poacher of African big game. The factor is computed using Equation 1.      TKOF  =     m  bullet   ⋅   v  bullet   ⋅   d  bullet    7000       TKOF     normal-⋅   subscript  m  bullet    subscript  v  bullet    subscript  d  bullet    7000     \mathrm{TKOF}=\frac{m_{\mathrm{bullet}}\cdot v_{\mathrm{bullet}}\cdot d_{%
 \mathrm{bullet}}}{7000}   (Equation 1)  Where       m   B  u  l  l  e  t      subscript  m    B  u  l  l  e  t     m_{Bullet}   is the bullet mass in grains (1 pound = 7000 grains )      v   B  u  l  l  e  t      subscript  v    B  u  l  l  e  t     v_{Bullet}   is the bullet velocity in feet per second      d   B  u  l  l  e  t      subscript  d    B  u  l  l  e  t     d_{Bullet}   is the bullet diameter in inches   If the international standard units of grams, millimeters, and meters per second are substituted, the divisor can be changed from 7000 to 3500 to give approximately the same resulting TKOF.  Taylor first described this measure of stopping power in his classic work "African Rifles and Cartridges" (Reference 1). In this work, Taylor did not actually state Equation 1. In fact, he stated in Reference 1 that "I do not think there is any necessity to go into the methods I employed to arrive at the formula I used, suffice it to say that the final figures agree in an altogether remarkable way with the actual performance of the rifles under practical hunting conditions." However, it is obvious from the text and his presentation that he used Equation 1.  Taylor referred to number generated by Equation 1 as the "Knock Out Value" or "Strike Energy." Common practice today is to refer to this value as the "Taylor KO factor" or simply "Taylor KO."  In Equation 1, the denominator value of 7000 is a scaling factor. It can be viewed one of two ways:   as converting the units of bullet mass from grains to pounds.  giving the TKOF a convenient numerical value from 0 to ~150 for normal hunting cartridges.   The TKOF has no physical meaning or scientific basis and is strictly used as a figure of merit for comparing cartridges. Its main advantage is the ability to attempt to represent complex terminal ballistics as a number. This can be utilized to assign different wounding capabilities to projectiles in video games.  Background  Example Calculation  Consider the case of a standard NATO 7.62 × 51 mm cartridge . It has the following characteristics:   diameter: 7.62 mm   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   0.30 inches  mass: 9.7 grams   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   150 grain bullet  velocity: 860 meters per second   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   2820 feet per second   The calculation is performed as shown in Equation 2.      TKOF  =    0.30  ⋅  150  ⋅  2820   7000   =  18.1        TKOF     normal-⋅  0.30  150  2820   7000        18.1     \mathrm{TKOF}=\frac{0.30\cdot 150\cdot 2820}{7000}=18.1   (Equation 2)  Alternative Approaches  Using numerical methods to evaluate the effectiveness of rifle cartridges has a long history and has been subject of much debate. The most common numerical methods used to evaluate the stopping power of cartridges are:   kinetic energy  momentum  TKOF  Thorniley Stopping Power   Each figure of merit weighs the cartridge characteristics differently. Some methods are based on fundamental physics (e.g. kinetic energy), while other methods are based on heuristic methods. Some of the more common figures of merit are:   kinetic energy: favors high velocity, lower mass bullets (no diameter dependence)  momentum: favors moderate velocity, moderate mass bullets (no diameter dependence)  TKOF: favors large diameter, moderate velocity, heavy bullets  Thorniley Stopping Power: favors moderate diameter, moderate velocity, moderate mass bullets   None of these methods truly consider bullet construction, with the exception of TKO, which dealt mainly with solid bullets. An expanding bullet, for example, may have better "stopping" power over another design, due to its increased wound channel as the jacket opens, even though it may be traveling at a lower velocity. Just as a large diameter solid, at low velocity may have better "stopping" power, due to its deep penetration, than a small diameter hollowpoint at max velocity.  Bullet shape does not factor in these methods either. Example: A solid, wide flat nosed bullet, may create more impact damage, than a solid, pointed or round nosed bullet of the same caliber at the same velocity.  These variables combine to effect bullet penetration, and tissue damage, in different ways. Thus making a simple, single method of bullet effectiveness, difficult to quantify.  Some examples of TKO factor's, and the factory loaded cartridge's derived from, are as follows:      TKO Factor   Name   Mass (gr)   Velocity (fps)   Bullet Diameter (in)       1074.9   .950 JDJ   3600   2200   0.950     19.6   .308 Winchester   168   2650   0.308     147   .50 BMG   660   3050   0.510     4.72   .380 ACP   95   980   0.355     6.20   .38 Special   158   770   0.357     8.56   .357 Sig   125   1350   0.355     24.9   .300 Winchester Magnum   180   3146   0.308     13.3   7.62 Soviet   123   2420   0.312     4.64   5.45x39mm   49   3000   0.221     35.5   .338 Lapua Magnum   250   2940   0.338     20.8   7.62×54mmR   181   2580   0.312     70.3   .458 Winchester Magnum   500   2150   0.458     53.0   .500 S&W; Magnum   500   1500   0.500     36.5   .45-70   450   1250   0.458     37.7   .500 Linebaugh   440   1200   0.510     35.2   .475 Linebaugh   370   1400   0.475     29.8   .480 Ruger   325   1350   0.475     41.0   .375 H&H;   300   2550   0.375     34.7   .405 Winchester   300   2000   0.4115     30.2   .454 Casull   260   1800   0.452     22.8   .38-55 Winchester   255   1650   0.3775     19.9   .44 Magnum   240   1350   0.429     12.3   .45 ACP   230   830   0.452     21.1   .35 Remington   200   2100   0.358     20.8   .30-06 Springfield   170   2850   0.308     10.4   .40 S&W;   165   1080   0.400     11.3   .357 Magnum   158   1400   0.357     9.2   .327 Magnum   115   1800   0.312     14.9   .30-30 Winchester   150   2250   0.308     7.31   9mm Parabellum   115   1250   0.355     8.70   .243 Winchester   85   2950   0.240     2.83   .32 ACP   71   900   0.309     5.78   .223 Remington   55   3300   0.224     1.33   .25 ACP   50   750   0.251     1.33   .22LR   30   1400   0.222     References      Further reading      See also   Stopping power  Taylor Knock-Out Factor Calculator  Thorniley Stopping Power Calculator   "  Category:Ballistics
