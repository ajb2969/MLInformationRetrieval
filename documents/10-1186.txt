2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-2-hydroxyglutarate + acceptor 
 
 
 
  2-oxoglutarate + reduced acceptor
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-2-hydroxyglutarate and acceptor, whereas its two products are 2-oxoglutarate and reduced acceptor. However, enzymes with specificity to (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase also exist in both mammals1 and plants2 even though they have not been given a unique EC number. This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism.
Nomenclature
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-2-hydroxyglutarate:acceptor 2-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include:

(S)-2-hydroxyglutarate:(acceptor) 2-oxidoreductase
alpha-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase
alpha-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (NAD{{+}} specific)
alpha-hydroxyglutarate oxidoreductase
alpha-ketoglutarate reductase
hydroxyglutaric dehydrogenase
L-alpha-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase
L-alpha-hydroxyglutarate:NAD{{+}} 2-oxidoreductase

Clinical significance
Deficiency in this enzyme in humans (D2HGDH) or in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana leads to massive accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate. In humans this results in the fatal neurometabolic disorder 2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria whereas plants seem to be to a large extent unaffected by high cellular concentrations of this compound.34
