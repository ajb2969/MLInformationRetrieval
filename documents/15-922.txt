   Lysine 6-dehydrogenase      Lysine 6-dehydrogenase   Lysine 6-dehydrogenase (, L-lysine epsilon-dehydrogenase , L-lysine 6-dehydrogenase , LysDH ) is an enzyme with system name L-lysine:NAD + 6-oxidoreductase (deaminating) . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   L-lysine + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (S)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2-carboxylate + NADH + H + + NH 3 (overall reaction)  (1a) L-lysine + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (S)-2-amino-6-oxohexanoate + NADH + H + + NH 3   (1b) (S)-2-amino-6-oxohexanoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (S)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2-carboxylate + H 2 O (spontaneous)   The enzyme is highly specific for L-lysine as substrate, although S-(2-aminoethyl)-L-cysteine can act as a substrate, but more slowly.
