   Tropinone reductase I      Tropinone reductase I   In enzymology , a tropinone reductase I () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   tropine + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   tropinone + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are tropine and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are tropinone , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is tropine:NADP + 3alpha-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include tropine dehydrogenase , tropinone reductase (ambiguous) , and TR-I . This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis ii .  References        "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of known structure
