Bogomolov conjecture

In mathematics, the Bogomolov conjecture, named for Fedor Bogomolov, is the following statement:
Let C be an algebraic curve of genus g at least two defined over a number field K, let 
 
 
 
  denote the algebraic closure of K, fix an embedding of C into its Jacobian variety J, and let 
 
 
 
  denote the Néron-Tate height on J associated to an ample symmetric divisor. Then there exists an 
 
 
 
  such that the set


 
    is finite.
Since 
 
 
 
  if and only if P is a torsion point, the Bogomolov conjecture generalises the Manin-Mumford conjecture. The original Bogomolov conjecture was proved by Emmanuel Ullmo and Shou-Wu Zhang in 1998.1 Zhang2 proved the following generalization:
Let A be an abelian variety defined over K, and let 
 
 
 
  be the Néron-Tate height on A associated to an ample symmetric divisor. A subvariety

 
  is called a torsion subvariety if it is the translate of an abelian subvariety of A by a torsion point. If X is not a torsion subvariety, then there is an 
 
 
 
  such that the set


 
    is not Zariski dense in A.
