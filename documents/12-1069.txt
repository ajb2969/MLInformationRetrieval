   Bogomolov conjecture      Bogomolov conjecture   In mathematics , the Bogomolov conjecture , named for Fedor Bogomolov , is the following statement:  Let C be an algebraic curve of genus  g at least two defined over a number field  K , let    K  ¯     normal-¯  K    \overline{K}   denote the algebraic closure of K , fix an embedding of C into its Jacobian variety  J , and let    h  ^     normal-^  h    \hat{h}   denote the Néron-Tate height on J associated to an ample symmetric divisor . Then there exists an    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   such that the set      {   P  ∈   C   (   K  ¯   )     :     h  ^    (  P  )    <  ϵ   }     conditional-set    P    C   normal-¯  K          normal-^  h   P   ϵ     \{P\in C(\overline{K}):\hat{h}(P)<\epsilon\}   is finite.  Since      h  ^    (  P  )    =  0         normal-^  h   P   0    \hat{h}(P)=0   if and only if P is a torsion point , the Bogomolov conjecture generalises the Manin-Mumford conjecture . The original Bogomolov conjecture was proved by Emmanuel Ullmo and Shou-Wu Zhang in 1998. 1 Zhang 2 proved the following generalization:  Let A be an abelian variety defined over K , and let    h  ^     normal-^  h    \hat{h}   be the Néron-Tate height on A associated to an ample symmetric divisor. A subvariety     X  ⊂  A      X  A    X\subset A   is called a torsion subvariety if it is the translate of an abelian subvariety of A by a torsion point. If X is not a torsion subvariety, then there is an    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   such that the set      {   P  ∈   X   (   K  ¯   )     :     h  ^    (  P  )    <  ϵ   }     conditional-set    P    X   normal-¯  K          normal-^  h   P   ϵ     \{P\in X(\overline{K}):\hat{h}(P)<\epsilon\}   is not Zariski dense in A .
