   Tetrahydrodipicolinate N-acetyltransferase      Tetrahydrodipicolinate N-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a tetrahydrodipicolinate N-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + (S)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + L-2-acetamido-6-oxoheptanedioate   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA , (S)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate , and H 2 O , whereas its two products are CoA and L-2-acetamido-6-oxoheptanedioate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:(S)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate N2-acetyltransferase . Other names in common use include tetrahydrodipicolinate acetylase , tetrahydrodipicolinate:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase , acetyl-CoA:L-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate N2-acetyltransferase , acetyl-CoA:(S)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate , and 2-N-acetyltransferase . This enzyme participates in lysine biosynthesis .  References     "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
