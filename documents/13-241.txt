   Ronen's golden rule for cluster radioactivity      Ronen's golden rule for cluster radioactivity   In nuclear physics , Ronen's golden rule for cluster radioactivity is that the most favorable parents for heavy ion emission (cluster radioactivity) are those that emit clusters which have atomic mass    A  z     subscript  A  z    A_{z}   which is given by     A  z   =    A   z  -  2    +  4  +   B   z  /  2          subscript  A  z      subscript  A    z  2    4   subscript  B    z  2       A_{z}=A_{z-2}+4+B_{z/2}   . The atomic number   Z   Z   Z   is even,     A  0   =  0       subscript  A  0   0    A_{0}=0   ,     B   z  /  2    =  0       subscript  B    z  2    0    B_{z/2}=0   for    Z  /  2      Z  2    Z/2   - odd and     B   z  /  2    =  2       subscript  B    z  2    2    B_{z/2}=2   for    Z  /  2      Z  2    Z/2   - even .The daughter nuclei is preferably magic, close to the double magic 208 Pb.
