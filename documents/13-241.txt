Ronen's golden rule for cluster radioactivity

In nuclear physics, Ronen's golden rule for cluster radioactivity is that the most favorable parents for heavy ion emission (cluster radioactivity) are those that emit clusters which have atomic mass 
 
 
 
  which is given by 
 
 
 
 . The atomic number 
 
 
 
  is even, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  - odd and 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  - even .The daughter nuclei is preferably magic, close to the double magic 208Pb.
