   Approximate limit      Approximate limit   In mathematics, the approximate limit is a generalization of the ordinary limit for real-valued functions of several real variables.  A function f on    ℝ  k     superscript  ℝ  k    \mathbb{R}^{k}   has an approximate limit y at a point x if there exists a set F that has density 1 at the point such that if x n is a sequence in F that converges towards x then f ( x n ) converges towards y .  Properties  The approximate limit of a function, if it exists, is unique. If f has an ordinary limit at x then it also has an approximate limit with the same value.  We denote the approximate limit of f at x 0 by      lim   x  →   x  0       ap  f    (  x  )     .      subscript    normal-→  x   subscript  x  0        ap  f   x     \lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}}\operatorname{ap}\ f(x).     Many of the properties of the ordinary limit are also true for the approximate limit.  In particular, if a is a scalar and f and g are functions, the following equations are true if values on the right-hand side are well-defined (that is the approximate limits exist and in the last equation the approximate limit of g is non-zero.)       lim   x  →   x  0       ap   a  ⋅  f     (  x  )        subscript    normal-→  x   subscript  x  0        ap   normal-⋅  a  f    x     \displaystyle\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}}\operatorname{ap}\ a\cdot f(x)     Approximate continuity and differentiability  If        lim   x  →   x  0       ap  f    (  x  )     =   f   (   x  0   )          subscript    normal-→  x   subscript  x  0        ap  f   x      f   subscript  x  0      \lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}}\operatorname{ap}\ f(x)=f(x_{0})    f is said to be approximately continuous at x 0 . If f is function of only one real variable and the difference quotient        f   (    x  0   +  h   )    -   f   (   x  0   )     h          f     subscript  x  0   h      f   subscript  x  0     h    \frac{f(x_{0}+h)-f(x_{0})}{h}   has an approximate limit as h approaches zero we say that f has an approximate derivative at x 0 . It turns out that approximate differentiability implies approximate continuity, in perfect analogy with ordinary continuity and differentiability.  It also turns out that the usual rules for the derivative of a sum, difference, product and quotient have straightforward generalizations to the approximate derivative. There is no generalization of the chain rule that is true in general however.
