   Covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups      Covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups   In the mathematical area of group theory , the covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups are groups that are used to understand the projective representations of the alternating and symmetric groups . The covering groups were classified in : for n ≥4 the covering groups are 2-fold covers except for the alternating groups of degree 6 and 7 where the covers are 6-fold.  For example the binary icosahedral group covers the icosahedral group , an alternating group of degree 5, and the binary tetrahedral group covers the tetrahedral group , an alternating group of degree 4.  Definition and classification  A group homomorphism from D to G is said to be a Schur cover of the finite group G if:   the kernel is contained both in the center and the derived subgroup of D , and  amongst all such homomorphisms, this D has maximal size.   The Schur multiplier of G is the kernel of any Schur cover and has many interpretations. When the homomorphism is understood, the group D is often called the Schur cover or Darstellungsgruppe.  The Schur covers of the symmetric and alternating groups were classified in . The symmetric group of degree n ≥ 4 has two isomorphism classes of Schur covers, both of order 2⋅ n !, and the alternating group of degree n has one isomorphism class of Schur cover, which has order n ! except when n is 6 or 7, in which case the Schur cover has order 3⋅ n !.  Finite presentations  Schur covers can be described using finite presentations . The symmetric group S n has a presentation on n −1 generators t i for i = 1, 2, ..., n−1 and relations   t i t i = 1, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n −1  t i +1 t i t i +1 = t i t i +1 t i , for 1 ≤ i ≤ n −2  t j t i = t i t j , for 1 ≤ i < i +2 ≤ j ≤ n −1.   These relations can be used to describe two non-isomorphic covers of the symmetric group. One covering group    2  ⋅   S  n  -      normal-⋅  2   superscript   subscript  S  n       2\cdot S_{n}^{-}   has generators z , t 1 , ..., t n −1 and relations:   zz = 1  t i t i = z , for 1 ≤ i ≤ n −1  t i +1 t i t i +1 = t i t i +1 t i , for 1 ≤ i ≤ n −2  t j t i = t i t j z , for 1 ≤ i < i +2 ≤ j ≤ n −1.   The same group    2  ⋅   S  n  -      normal-⋅  2   superscript   subscript  S  n       2\cdot S_{n}^{-}   can be given the following presentation using the generators z and s i given by t i or t i z according as i is odd or even:   zz = 1  s i s i = z , for 1 ≤ i ≤ n −1  s i +1 s i s i +1 = s i s i +1 s i z , for 1 ≤ i ≤ n −2  s j s i = s i s j z , for 1 ≤ i < i +2 ≤ j ≤ n −1.   The other covering group    2  ⋅   S  n  +      normal-⋅  2   superscript   subscript  S  n       2\cdot S_{n}^{+}   has generators z , t 1 , ..., t n −1 and relations:   zz = 1, zt i = t i z , for 1 ≤ i ≤ n −1  t i t i = 1, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n −1  t i +1 t i t i +1 = t i t i +1 t i z , for 1 ≤ i ≤ n −2  t j t i = t i t j z , for 1 ≤ i < i +2 ≤ j ≤ n −1.   The same group    2  ⋅   S  n  +      normal-⋅  2   superscript   subscript  S  n       2\cdot S_{n}^{+}   can be given the following presentation using the generators z and s i given by t i or t i z according as i is odd or even:   zz = 1, zs i = s i z , for 1 ≤ i ≤ n −1  s i s i = 1, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n −1  s i +1 s i s i +1 = s i s i +1 s i , for 1 ≤ i ≤ n −2  s j s i = s i s j z , for 1 ≤ i < i +2 ≤ j ≤ n −1.   Sometimes all of the relations of the symmetric group are expressed as ( t i t j ) m ij = 1, where m ij are non-negative integers, namely m ii = 1, m i , i +1 = 3, and m ij = 2, for 1 ≤ i 2\cdot S_n^- becomes particularly simple in this form: ( t i t j ) m ij = z , and zz = 1.    2  ⋅   S  n  +      normal-⋅  2   superscript   subscript  S  n       2\cdot S_{n}^{+}   has the nice property that its generators all have order 2.  Projective representations  Covering groups were introduced by Issai Schur to classify projective representations of groups. A (complex) linear representation of a group G is a group homomorphism  G → GL( n , C ) from the group G to a general linear group , while a projective representation is a homomorphism G → PGL( n , C ) from G to a projective linear group . Projective representations of G correspond naturally to linear representations of the covering group of G .  The projective representations of alternating and symmetric groups are the subject of the book .  Integral homology  Covering groups correspond to the second group homology group, H 2 ( G , Z ), also known as the Schur multiplier . The Schur multipliers of the alternating groups A n (in the case where n is at least 4) are the cyclic groups of order 2, except in the case where n is either 6 or 7, in which case there is also a triple cover. In these cases, then, the Schur multiplier is the cyclic group of order 6, and the covering group is a 6-fold cover.   H 2 ( A n , Z ) = 0 for n ≤ 3  H 2 ( A n , Z ) = Z /2 Z for n = 4, 5  H 2 ( A n , Z ) = Z /6 Z for n = 6, 7  H 2 ( A n , Z ) = Z /2 Z for n ≥ 8   For the symmetric group, the Schur multiplier vanishes for n ≤ 3, and is the cyclic group of order 2 for n ≥ 4:   H 2 ( S n , Z ) = 0 for n ≤ 3  H 2 ( S n , Z ) = Z /2 Z for n ≥ 4   Construction of double covers  The double covers can be constructed as spin (respectively, pin) covers of faithful, irreducible, linear representations of A n and S n . These spin representations exist for all n, but are the covering groups only for n≥4 (n≠6,7 for A n ). For n ≤3, S n and A n are their own Schur covers.  Explicitly, S n acts on the n -dimensional space R n by permuting coordinates (in matrices, as permutation matrices ). This has a 1-dimensional trivial subrepresentation corresponding to vectors with all coordinates equal, and the complementary ( n −1)-dimensional subrepresentation (of vectors whose coordinates sum to 0) is irreducible for n≥4. Geometrically, this is the symmetries of the ( n −1)- simplex , and algebraically, it yields maps     A  n   ↪   SO   (   n  -  1   )       normal-↪   subscript  A  n    SO    n  1      A_{n}\hookrightarrow\operatorname{SO}(n-1)   and     S  n   ↪   O   (   n  -  1   )       normal-↪   subscript  S  n    normal-O    n  1      S_{n}\hookrightarrow\operatorname{O}(n-1)   expressing these as discrete subgroups ( point groups ). The special orthogonal group has a 2-fold cover by the spin group       Spin   (  n  )    →   SO   (  n  )     ,     normal-→   Spin  n    SO  n     \operatorname{Spin}(n)\to\operatorname{SO}(n),   and restricting this cover to    A  n     subscript  A  n    A_{n}   and taking the preimage yields a 2-fold cover      2  ⋅   A  n    →   A  n    .     normal-→   normal-⋅  2   subscript  A  n     subscript  A  n     2\cdot A_{n}\to A_{n}.   A similar construction with a pin group yields the 2-fold cover of the symmetric group       Pin  ±    (  n  )    →   O   (  n  )     .     normal-→    subscript  Pin  plus-or-minus   n    normal-O  n     \operatorname{Pin}_{\pm}(n)\to\operatorname{O}(n).   As there are two pin groups, there are two distinct 2-fold covers of the symmetric group, 2⋅ S n ± , also called     S  ~   n     subscript   normal-~  S   n    \tilde{S}_{n}   and     S  ^   n     subscript   normal-^  S   n    \hat{S}_{n}   .  == Construction of triple cover for n = 6, 7 ==  The triple covering of     A  6   ,     subscript  A  6    A_{6},   denoted     3  ⋅   A  6    ,     normal-⋅  3   subscript  A  6     3\cdot A_{6},   and the corresponding triple cover of     S  6   ,     subscript  S  6    S_{6},   denoted     3  ⋅   S  6    ,     normal-⋅  3   subscript  S  6     3\cdot S_{6},   can be constructed as symmetries of a certain set of vector is complex 6-space. While the exceptional triple covers of A 6 and A 7 extend to extensions of S 6 and S 7 , these extensions are not central and so do not form Schur covers.  This construction is important in the study of the sporadic groups , and in much of the exceptional behavior of small classical and exceptional groups, including: construction of the Mathieu group M 24 , the exceptional covers of the projective unitary group      U  4    (  3  )        subscript  U  4   3    U_{4}(3)   and the projective special linear group       L  3    (  4  )    ,       subscript  L  3   4    L_{3}(4),   and the exceptional double cover of the group of Lie type       G  2    (  4  )    .       subscript  G  2   4    G_{2}(4).     Exceptional isomorphisms  For low dimensions there are exceptional isomorphisms with the map from a special linear group over a finite field to the projective special linear group .  For n = 3, the symmetric group is SL(2,2) ≅ PSL(2,2) and is its own Schur cover.  For n = 4, the Schur cover of the alternating group is given by SL(2,3) → PSL(2,3) ≅ A 4 , which can also be thought of as the binary tetrahedral group covering the tetrahedral group . Similarly, GL(2,3) → PGL(2,3) ≅ S 4 is a Schur cover, but there is a second non-isomorphic Schur cover of S 4 contained in GL(2,9) – note that 9=3 2 so this is extension of scalars of GL(2,3). In terms of the above presentations, GL(2,3) ≅ Ŝ 4 .  For n = 5, the Schur cover of the alternating group is given by SL(2,5) → PSL(2,5) ≅ A 5 , which can also be thought of as the binary icosahedral group covering the icosahedral group . Though PGL(2,5) ≅ S 5 , GL(2,5) → PGL(2,5) is not a Schur cover as the kernel is not contained in the derived subgroup of GL(2,5). The Schur cover of PGL(2,5) is contained in GL(2,25) – as before, 25=5 2 , so this extends the scalars.  For n = 6, the double cover of the alternating group is given by SL(2,9) → PSL(2,9) ≅ A 6 . While PGL(2,9) is contained in the automorphism group PΓL (2,9) of PSL(2,9) ≅ A 6 , PGL(2,9) is not isomorphic to S 6 , and its Schur covers (which are double covers) are not contained in nor a quotient of GL(2,9). Note that in almost all cases,      S  n   ≅   Aut   (   A  n   )     ,       subscript  S  n    Aut   subscript  A  n      S_{n}\cong\operatorname{Aut}(A_{n}),   with the unique exception of A 6 , due to the exceptional outer automorphism of A 6 . Another subgroup of the automorphism group of A 6 is M 10 , the Mathieu group of degree 10, whose Schur cover is a triple cover. The Schur covers of the symmetric group S 6 itself have no faithful representations as a subgroup of GL( d ,9) for d ≤3. The four Schur covers of the automorphism group PΓL(2,9) of A 6 are double covers.  For n = 8, the alternating group A 8 is isomorphic to SL(4,2) = PSL(4,2), and so SL(4,2) → PSL(4,2), which is 1-to-1, not 2-to-1, is not a Schur cover.  Properties  Schur covers of finite perfect groups are superperfect , that is both their first and second integral homology vanish. In particular, the double covers of A n for n ≥ 4 are superperfect, except for n = 6, 7, and the six-fold covers of A n are superperfect for n = 6, 7.  As stem extensions of a simple group, the covering groups of A n are quasisimple groups for n ≥ 5.  References          "  Category:Finite groups  Category:Permutation groups
