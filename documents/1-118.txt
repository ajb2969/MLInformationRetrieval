   Borel measure      Borel measure   In mathematics , specifically in measure theory , a Borel measure on a topological space is a measure that is defined on all open sets (and thus on all Borel sets ). 1 Some authors require additional restrictions on the measure, as described below.  Formal definition  Let X be a locally compact  Hausdorff space , and let    𝔅   (  X  )       𝔅  X    \mathfrak{B}(X)   be the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open sets of X ; this is known as the σ-algebra of Borel sets . A Borel measure is any measure μ defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets. 2 Some authors require in addition that μ ( C ) \mathbb R with its usual topology is a locally compact Hausdorff space, hence we can define a Borel measure on it. In this case,    𝔅   (  ℝ  )       𝔅  ℝ    \mathfrak{B}(\mathbb{R})   is the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open intervals of   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   . While there are many Borel measures μ, the choice of Borel measure which assigns     μ   (   [  a  ,  b  ]   )    =   b  -  a         μ   a  b      b  a     \mu([a,b])=b-a   for every interval    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   is sometimes called "the" Borel measure on   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   . In practice, even "the" Borel measure is not the most useful measure defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets; indeed, the Lebesgue measure    λ   λ   \lambda   is an extension of "the" Borel measure which possesses the crucial property that it is a complete measure (unlike the Borel measure). To clarify, when one says that the Lebesgue measure   λ   λ   \lambda   is an extension of the Borel measure   μ   μ   \mu   , it means that every Borel-measurable set E is also a Lebesgue-measurable set, and the Borel measure and the Lebesgue measure coincide on the Borel sets (i.e.,     λ   (  E  )    =   μ   (  E  )          λ  E     μ  E     \lambda(E)=\mu(E)   for every Borel measurable set).  Applications  Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral  The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral is the ordinary Lebesgue integral with respect to a measure known as the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure, which may be associated to any function of bounded variation on the real line. The Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure is a regular Borel measure , and conversely every regular Borel measure on the real line is of this kind. 3  Laplace transform  One can define the Laplace transform of a finite Borel measure μ on the real line by the Lebesgue integral 4         (   ℒ  μ   )    (  s  )    =    ∫   [  0  ,  ∞  )       e   -   s  t      d  μ   (  t  )      .          ℒ  μ   s     subscript    0        superscript  e      s  t     d  μ  t      (\mathcal{L}\mu)(s)=\int_{[0,\infty)}e^{-st}\,d\mu(t).     An important special case is where μ is a probability measure or, even more specifically, the Dirac delta function. In operational calculus , the Laplace transform of a measure is often treated as though the measure came from a distribution function  f . In that case, to avoid potential confusion, one often writes        (   ℒ  f   )    (  s  )    =    ∫   0  -   ∞     e   -   s  t     f   (  t  )   d  t            ℒ  f   s     superscript   subscript    superscript  0          superscript  e      s  t     f  t  d  t      (\mathcal{L}f)(s)=\int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}e^{-st}f(t)\,dt     where the lower limit of 0 − is shorthand notation for        lim   ε  ↓  0     ∫   -  ε   ∞    .      subscript    normal-↓  ε  0     superscript   subscript     ε        \lim_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}\int_{-\varepsilon}^{\infty}.     This limit emphasizes that any point mass located at 0 is entirely captured by the Laplace transform. Although with the Lebesgue integral , it is not necessary to take such a limit, it does appear more naturally in connection with the Laplace–Stieltjes transform .  Hausdorff dimension and Frostman's lemma  Given a Borel measure μ on a metric space X such that μ( X ) > 0 and μ( B ( x , r )) ≤ r s holds for some constant s > 0 and for every ball B ( x , r ) in X , then the Hausdorff dimension dim Haus ( X ) ≥ s . A partial converse is provided by Frostman's lemma : 5  Lemma: Let A be a Borel subset of R n , and let s > 0. Then the following are equivalent:   H s ( A ) > 0, where H s denotes the s -dimensional Hausdorff measure .  There is an (unsigned) Borel measure μ satisfying μ ( A ) > 0, and such that          μ   (   B   (  x  ,  r  )    )    ≤   r  s         μ    B   x  r      superscript  r  s     \mu(B(x,r))\leq r^{s}       holds for all x ∈ R n and r > 0.   Cramér–Wold theorem  The Cramér–Wold theorem in measure theory states that a Borel probability measure on    R  k     superscript  R  k    R^{k}   is uniquely determined by the totality of its one-dimensional projections. 6 It is used as a method for proving joint convergence results. The theorem is named after Harald Cramér and Herman Ole Andreas Wold .  References  Further reading    .
