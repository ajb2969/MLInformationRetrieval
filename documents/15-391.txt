   Ternary commutator      Ternary commutator   In mathematical physics , the ternary commutator is an additional ternary operation on a triple system defined by        [  a  ,  b  ,  c  ]   =      a  b  c   -   a  c  b   -   b  a  c    +   b  c  a   +   c  a  b    -   c  b  a     .       a  b  c           a  b  c     a  c  b     b  a  c      b  c  a     c  a  b      c  b  a      [a,b,c]=abc-acb-bac+bca+cab-cba.\,   Also called the ternutator or alternating ternary sum , it is a special case of the n -commutator for n = 3, whereas the 2-commutator is the ordinary commutator .
