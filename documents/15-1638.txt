   CMP-N,N'-diacetyllegionaminic acid synthase      CMP-N,N'-diacetyllegionaminic acid synthase   CMP-N,N'-diacetyllegionaminic acid synthase (, CMP-N,N'-diacetyllegionaminic acid synthetase , neuA (gene) , legF (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name CTP:N,N'-diacetyllegionaminate cytidylyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   CTP + N,N'-diacetyllegionaminate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CMP-N,N'-diacetyllegionaminate + diphosphate    This enzyme is isolated from the bacteria  Legionella pneumophila and Campylobacter jejuni .
