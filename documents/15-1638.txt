CMP-N,N'-diacetyllegionaminic acid synthase

CMP-N,N'-diacetyllegionaminic acid synthase (, CMP-N,N'-diacetyllegionaminic acid synthetase, neuA (gene), legF (gene)) is an enzyme with system name CTP:N,N'-diacetyllegionaminate cytidylyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

CTP + N,N'-diacetyllegionaminate 
 
 
 
  CMP-N,N'-diacetyllegionaminate + diphosphate


This enzyme is isolated from the bacteria Legionella pneumophila and Campylobacter jejuni.
