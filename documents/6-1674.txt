Projective object

In category theory, the notion of a projective object generalizes the notion of a projective module.
An object P in a category C is projective if the hom functor


 
  preserves epimorphisms. That is, every morphism f:P→X factors through every epi Y→X.
Let 
 
 
 
  be an abelian category. In this context, an object 
 
 
 
  is called a projective object if



is an exact functor, where 
 
 
 
  is the category of abelian groups.
The dual notion of a projective object is that of an injective object: An object 
 
 
 
  in an abelian category 
 
 
 
  is injective if the 
 
 
functor from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  is exact.
Enough projectives
Let 
 
 
 
  be an abelian category. 
 
 
 
  is said to have enough projectives if, for every object 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , there is a projective object 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  and an exact sequence



In other words, the map

 
  is "epi", or an epimorphism.
Examples.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a ring with 1. Consider the category of left 
 
 
 
 -modules 
 
 

 
  is an abelian category. The projective objects in 
 
 
 
  are precisely the projective left R-modules. So 
 
 
 
  is itself a projective object in 
 
 
 
  Dually, the injective objects in 
 
 
 
  are exactly the injective left R-modules.
The category of left (right) 
 
 
 
 -modules also has enough projectives. This is true since, for every left (right) 
 
 
 
 -module 
 
 
 
 , we can take 
 
 
 
  to be the free (and hence projective) 
 
 
 
 -module generated by a generating set 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  (we can in fact take 
 
 
 
  to be 
 
 
 
 ). Then the canonical projection

 
  is the required surjection.
