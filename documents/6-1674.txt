   Projective object      Projective object   In category theory , the notion of a projective object generalizes the notion of a projective module .  An object P in a category C is projective if the hom functor       Hom   (  P  ,  -  )    :   𝒞  →  𝐒𝐞𝐭      normal-:   Hom  P     normal-→  𝒞  𝐒𝐞𝐭     \operatorname{Hom}(P,-)\colon\mathcal{C}\to\mathbf{Set}   preserves epimorphisms . That is, every morphism f:P→X factors through every epi Y→X .  Let   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   be an abelian category . In this context, an object    P  ∈  𝒞      P  𝒞    P\in\mathcal{C}   is called a projective object if       Hom   (  P  ,  -  )    :   𝒞  →  𝐀𝐛      normal-:   Hom  P     normal-→  𝒞  𝐀𝐛     \operatorname{Hom}(P,-)\colon\mathcal{C}\to\mathbf{Ab}     is an exact functor , where   𝐀𝐛   𝐀𝐛   \mathbf{Ab}   is the category of abelian groups .  The dual notion of a projective object is that of an injective object : An object   Q   Q   Q   in an abelian category   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   is injective if the    Hom   (  -  ,  Q  )      Hom   Q    \operatorname{Hom}(-,Q)    functor from   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   to   𝐀𝐛   𝐀𝐛   \mathbf{Ab}   is exact.  Enough projectives  Let   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   be an abelian category .   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   is said to have enough projectives if, for every object   A   A   A   of   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   , there is a projective object   P   P   P   of   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   and an exact sequence      P  ⟶  A  ⟶  0.       normal-⟶  P  A    normal-⟶    0.     P\longrightarrow A\longrightarrow 0.     In other words, the map     p  :   P  →  A      normal-:  p   normal-→  P  A     p\colon P\to A   is "epi", or an epimorphism .  Examples.  Let   R   R   R   be a ring with 1. Consider the category of left   R   R   R   -modules     ℳ  R   .     subscript  ℳ  R    \mathcal{M}_{R}.       ℳ  R     subscript  ℳ  R    \mathcal{M}_{R}   is an abelian category. The projective objects in    ℳ  R     subscript  ℳ  R    \mathcal{M}_{R}   are precisely the projective left R-modules . So   R   R   R   is itself a projective object in     ℳ  R   .     subscript  ℳ  R    \mathcal{M}_{R}.   Dually, the injective objects in    ℳ  R     subscript  ℳ  R    \mathcal{M}_{R}   are exactly the injective left R-modules .  The category of left (right)   R   R   R   -modules also has enough projectives. This is true since, for every left (right)   R   R   R   -module   M   M   M   , we can take   F   F   F   to be the free (and hence projective)   R   R   R   -module generated by a generating set   X   X   X   for   M   M   M   (we can in fact take   X   X   X   to be   M   M   M   ). Then the canonical projection     π  :   F  →  M      normal-:  π   normal-→  F  M     \pi\colon F\to M   is the required surjection .
