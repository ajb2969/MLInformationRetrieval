   12beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase      12beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 12beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3alpha,7alpha,12beta-trihydroxy-5beta-cholanate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-12-oxo-5beta-cholanate + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3alpha,7alpha,12beta-trihydroxy-5beta-cholanate and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-12-oxo-5beta-cholanate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 12beta-hydroxysteroid:NADP + 12-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 12beta-hydroxy steroid (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) , and dehydrogenase .
