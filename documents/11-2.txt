   Phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase      Phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase   In enzymology , a phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-phosphonopyruvate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-phosphonoacetaldehyde + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 3-phosphonopyruvate , and two products , 2-phosphonoacetaldehyde and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-phosphonopyruvate carboxy-lyase (2-phosphonoacetaldehyde-forming) . This enzyme is also called 3-phosphonopyruvate carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in aminophosphonate metabolism .  References       "  Category:EC 4.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
