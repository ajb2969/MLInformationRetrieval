Octacontagon

In geometry, an octacontagon (or ogdoëcontagon from Ancient Greek ὁγδοήκοντα, eighty1) is an eighty-sided polygon.23 The sum of any octacontagon's interior angles is 14040 degrees.
A regular octacontagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {80} and can also be constructed as a quasiregular truncated tetracontagon, t{40}, which alternates two types of edges.
Regular octacontagon properties
One interior angle in a regular octacontagon is 175.5°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 4.5°.
The area of a regular octacontagon is (with )



and its inradius is



The circumradius of a regular octacontagon is



A regular octacontagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge.4 As a truncated tetracontagon, it can be constructed by an edge-bisection of a regular tetracontagon. This means that the trigonometric functions of π/80 can be expressed in radicals:









Octacontagram
An octacontagram is an 80-sided star polygon. There are 15 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols {80/3}, {80/7}, {80/9}, {80/11}, {80/13}, {80/17}, {80/19}, {80/21}, {80/23}, {80/27}, {80/29}, {80/31}, {80/33}, {80/37}, and {80/39}, as well as 24 regular star figures with the same vertex configuration.
