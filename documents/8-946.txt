   Octacontagon      Octacontagon   In geometry , an octacontagon (or ogdoëcontagon from Ancient Greek ὁγδοήκοντα, eighty 1 ) is an eighty-sided polygon . 2 3 The sum of any octacontagon's interior angles is 14040 degrees.  A regular octacontagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {80} and can also be constructed as a quasiregular truncated  tetracontagon , t{40}, which alternates two types of edges.  Regular octacontagon properties  One interior angle in a regular octacontagon is 175.5°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 4.5°.  The area of a regular octacontagon is (with )      A  =   20   t  2    cot   π  80         A    20   superscript  t  2       π  80       A=20t^{2}\cot\frac{\pi}{80}     and its inradius is      r  =    1  2   t   cot   π  80         r      1  2   t      π  80       r=\frac{1}{2}t\cot\frac{\pi}{80}     The circumradius of a regular octacontagon is      R  =    1  2   t   csc   π  80         R      1  2   t      π  80       R=\frac{1}{2}t\csc\frac{\pi}{80}     A regular octacontagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge . 4 As a truncated  tetracontagon , it can be constructed by an edge- bisection of a regular tetracontagon. This means that the trigonometric functions of π/80 can be expressed in radicals:       sin   π  80    =   sin   2.25  ∘    =    1  8    (   1  +   5    )    (    -    2  -    2  +   2        -     (   2  +   2    )    (   2  -    2  +   2      )      )              π  80       superscript  2.25              1  8     1    5            2      2    2              2    2      2      2    2             \sin\frac{\pi}{80}=\sin 2.25^{\circ}=\frac{1}{8}(1+\sqrt{5})(-\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+%

There are 15 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols {80/3}, {80/7}, {80/9}, {80/11}, {80/13}, {80/17}, {80/19}, {80/21}, {80/23}, {80/27}, {80/29}, {80/31}, {80/33}, {80/37}, and {80/39}, as well as 24 regular star figures with the same vertex configuration .
