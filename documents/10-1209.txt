Glucose dehydrogenase (acceptor)




Glucose dehydrogenase (acceptor)

In enzymology, a glucose dehydrogenase (acceptor) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-glucose + acceptor 
 
 
 
  D-glucono-1,5-lactone + reduced acceptor
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-glucose and acceptor, whereas its two products are D-glucono-1,5-lactone and reduced acceptor.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glucose:acceptor 1-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include glucose dehydrogenase (Aspergillus), glucose dehydrogenase (decarboxylating), and D-glucose:(acceptor) 1-oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway. It employs one cofactor, FAD.
