   Hypergeometric function      Hypergeometric function   In mathematics , the Gaussian or ordinary hypergeometric function  2 F 1 ( a , b ; c ; z ) is a special function represented by the hypergeometric series , that includes many other special functions as specific or limiting cases . It is a solution of a second-order linear  ordinary differential equation (ODE). Every second-order linear ODE with three regular singular points can be transformed into this equation.  For systematic lists of some of the many thousands of published identities involving the hypergeometric function, see the reference works by , , and . There is no known system for organizing all of the identities; indeed, there is no known algorithm that can generate all identities; a number of different algorithms are known that generate different series of identities. The theory of the algorithmic discovery of identities remains an active research topic.  History  The term "hypergeometric series" was first used by John Wallis in his 1655 book Arithmetica Infinitorum .  Hypergeometric series were studied by Leonhard Euler , but the first full systematic treatment was given by .  Studies in the nineteenth century included those of , and the fundamental characterisation by  of the hypergeometric function by means of the differential equation it satisfies.  Riemann showed that the second-order differential equation for 2 F 1 ( z ), examined in the complex plane, could be characterised (on the Riemann sphere ) by its three regular singularities .  The cases where the solutions are algebraic functions were found by Hermann Schwarz ( Schwarz's list ).  The hypergeometric series  The hypergeometric function is defined for       F  1    2     (  a  ,  b  ;  c  ;  z  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞        (  a  )   n     (  b  )   n      (  c  )   n      z  n    n  !       .         subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a  b  c  z      superscript   subscript     n  0             subscript  a  n    subscript  b  n     subscript  c  n       superscript  z  n     n        {}_{2}F_{1}(a,b;c;z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(a)_{n}(b)_{n}}{(c)_{n}}\frac{z^%

Here ( q ) n is the (rising) Pochhammer symbol , which is defined by:         F  1    2     (   -  m   ,  b  ;  c  ;  z  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   m      (   -  1   )   n    (     m      n     )      (  b  )   n     (  c  )   n     z  n      .         subscript   subscript  F  1   2      m   b  c  z      superscript   subscript     n  0    m      superscript    1   n    binomial  m  n      subscript  b  n    subscript  c  n     superscript  z  n       {}_{2}F_{1}(-m,b;c;z)=\sum_{n=0}^{m}(-1)^{n}{\left({{m}\atop{n}}\right)}\frac{%
 (b)_{n}}{(c)_{n}}z^{n}.     The series terminates if either a or b is a nonpositive integer, in which case the function reduces to a polynomial:      c  →  −  m      c  normal-→  normal-−  m    c→−m     For complex arguments z with | z | ≥ 1 it can be analytically continued along any path in the complex plane that avoids the branch points 0 and 1.

Special cases  Many of the common mathematical functions can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function, or as limiting cases of it. Some typical examples are        (   1  -  z   )    -  a     =  2     F  1    (  a  ,  1  ;  1  ;  z  )        subscript   2    superscript    1  z     a       subscript  F  1    a  1  1  z      (1-z)^{-a}=\ _{2}F_{1}(a,1;1;z)          arcsin   (  z  )    =     z   2    F  1    (    1  2    ,    1  2    ;    3  2    ;   z  2   )          z      subscript  z  2    subscript  F  1      1  2     1  2     3  2    superscript  z  2       \arcsin(z)=z\ _{2}F_{1}\left(\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{1}{2};\tfrac{3}{2};z^{2}\right)          M   (  a  ,  c  ,  z  )    =    lim   b  →  ∞      F  1    2     (  a  ,  b  ;  c  ;    b   -  1    z   )           M   a  c  z      subscript    normal-→  b        subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a  b  c     superscript  b    1    z        M(a,c,z)=\lim_{b\to\infty}{}_{2}F_{1}(a,b;c;b^{-1}z)     The confluent hypergeometric function (or Kummer's function) can be given as a limit of the hypergeometric function        F  1    2     (  a  ,   1  -  a   ;  c  ;  z  )    =   Γ   (  c  )    z     1  -  c   2       (   1  -  z   )      c  -  1   2      P   -  a    1  -  c     (   1  -   2  z    )           subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a    1  a   c  z      normal-Γ  c   superscript  z      1  c   2     superscript    1  z       c  1   2     superscript   subscript  P    a      1  c      1    2  z       {}_{2}F_{1}(a,1-a;c;z)=\Gamma(c)z^{\tfrac{1-c}{2}}(1-z)^{\tfrac{c-1}{2}}P_{-a}%
 ^{1-c}(1-2z)     so all functions that are essentially special cases of it, such as Bessel functions , can be expressed as limits of hypergeometric functions. These include most of the commonly used functions of mathematical physics.  Legendre functions are solutions of a second order differential equation with 3 regular singular points so can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function in many ways, for example        F  1    2     (   -  n   ,   α  +  1  +  β  +  n   ;   α  +  1   ;  x  )    =     n  !

 2}F_{1}\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2};1;z\right)}     Other polynomials that are special cases include Krawtchouk polynomials , Meixner polynomials , Meixner–Pollaczek polynomials .  Elliptic modular functions can sometimes be expressed as the inverse functions of ratios of hypergeometric functions whose arguments a , b , c are 1, 1/2, 1/3, ... or 0. For example, if      z  =    κ  2    (  τ  )    =     θ  2     (  τ  )   4      θ  3     (  τ  )   4           z     superscript  κ  2   τ             subscript  θ  2    superscript  τ  4       subscript  θ  3    superscript  τ  4        z=\kappa^{2}(\tau)=\frac{\theta_{2}(\tau)^{4}}{\theta_{3}(\tau)^{4}}     then        B  x    (  p  ,  q  )    =      x  p   p     F  1    2     (  p  ,   1  -  q   ;   p  +  1   ;  x  )           subscript  B  x    p  q         superscript  x  p   p    subscript   subscript  F  1   2    p    1  q     p  1   x      B_{x}(p,q)=\tfrac{x^{p}}{p}{}_{2}F_{1}(p,1-q;p+1;x)     is an elliptic modular function of τ.  Incomplete beta functions  B x ( p , q ) are related by       K   (  k  )    =       π  2     2    F  1    (    1  2    ,    1  2    ;  1  ;   k  2   )          K  k      subscript    π  2   2    subscript  F  1      1  2     1  2   1   superscript  k  2       K(k)=\tfrac{\pi}{2}\,_{2}F_{1}\left(\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{1}{2};1;k^{2}\right)     The complete elliptic integrals  K and E are given by       E   (  k  )    =       π  2     2    F  1    (   -    1  2     ,    1  2    ;  1  ;   k  2   )          E  k      subscript    π  2   2    subscript  F  1        1  2      1  2   1   superscript  k  2       E(k)=\tfrac{\pi}{2}\,_{2}F_{1}\left(-\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{1}{2};1;k^{2}\right)            z   (   1  -  z   )      d  2   w    d   z  2      +    [   c  -    (   a  +  b  +  1   )   z    ]     d  w    d  z      -   a   b   w    =  0.            z    1  z        superscript  d  2   w     d   superscript  z  2         delimited-[]    c      a  b  1   z         d  w     d  z        a  b  w    0.    z(1-z)\frac{d^{2}w}{dz^{2}}+\left[c-(a+b+1)z\right]\frac{dw}{dz}-ab\,w=0.     The hypergeometric differential equation  The hypergeometric function is a solution of Euler's hypergeometric differential equation        F  1    2      (  a  ,  b  ;  c  ;  z  )        subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a  b  c  z     \,{}_{2}F_{1}(a,b;c;z)     which has three regular singular points : 0,1 and ∞. The generalization of this equation to three arbitrary regular singular points is given by Riemann's differential equation . Any second order differential equation with three regular singular points can be converted to the hypergeometric differential equation by a change of variables.  Solutions at the singular points  Solutions to the hypergeometric differential equation are built out of the hypergeometric series 2 F 1 ( a , b ; c ; z ). The equation has two linearly independent solutions. At each of the three singular points 0, 1, ∞, there are usually two special solutions of the form x s times a holomorphic function of x , where s is one of the two roots of the indicial equation and x is a local variable vanishing at the regular singular point. This gives 3 × 2 = 6 special solutions, as follows.  Around the point z = 0, two independent solutions are, if c is not a non-positive integer,       z  2   1  -  c     F  1    (    1  +  a   -  c   ,    1  +  b   -  c   ;   2  -  c   ;  z  )        subscript   superscript  z    1  c    2    subscript  F  1        1  a   c       1  b   c     2  c   z     z^{1-c}\,_{2}F_{1}(1+a-c,1+b-c;2-c;z)     and, on condition that c is not an integer,        z  m   F   (   a  +  m   ,   b  +  m   ;   1  +  m   ;  z  )    .       superscript  z  m   F     a  m     b  m     1  m   z     z^{m}F(a+m,b+m;1+m;z).     If c is a non-positive integer 1− m , then the first of these solutions doesn't exist and must be replaced by      F  1    2      (  a  ,  b  ;    1  +  a  +  b   -  c   ;   1  -  z   )        subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a  b      1  a  b   c     1  z      \,{}_{2}F_{1}(a,b;1+a+b-c;1-z)   The second solution doesn't exist when c is an integer greater than 1, and is equal to the first solution, or its replacement, when c is any other integer. So when c is an integer, a more complicated expression must be used for a second solution, equal to the first solution multiplied by ln( z ), plus another series in powers of z , involving the digamma function . See  for details.  Around z = 1, if c − a − b is not an integer, one has two independent solutions        (   1  -  z   )   2   c  -  a  -  b     F  1    (   c  -  a   ,   c  -  b   ;    1  +  c   -  a  -  b   ;   1  -  z   )        subscript   superscript    1  z     c  a  b    2    subscript  F  1      c  a     c  b       1  c   a  b     1  z      (1-z)^{c-a-b}\;_{2}F_{1}(c-a,c-b;1+c-a-b;1-z)     and       z  2   -  a     F  1    (  a  ,    1  +  a   -  c   ;    1  +  a   -  b   ;   z   -  1    )        subscript   superscript  z    a    2    subscript  F  1    a      1  a   c       1  a   b    superscript  z    1       z^{-a}\,_{2}F_{1}\left(a,1+a-c;1+a-b;z^{-1}\right)     Around z = ∞, if a − b is not an integer, one has two independent solutions        z  2   -  b     F  1    (  b  ,    1  +  b   -  c   ;    1  +  b   -  a   ;   z   -  1    )    .       subscript   superscript  z    b    2    subscript  F  1    b      1  b   c       1  b   a    superscript  z    1       z^{-b}\,_{2}F_{1}\left(b,1+b-c;1+b-a;z^{-1}\right).     and        (   1  -  z   )    -  a    F   (  a  ,   c  -  b   ;  c  ;    z   z  -  1     )        superscript    1  z     a    F   a    c  b   c    z    z  1       (1-z)^{-a}F\left(a,c-b;c;\tfrac{z}{z-1}\right)     Again, when the conditions of non-integrality are not met, there exist other solutions that are more complicated.  Any 3 of the above 6 solutions satisfy a linear relation as the space of solutions is 2-dimensional, giving () = 20 linear relations between them called connection formulas .  Kummer's 24 solutions  A second order Fuchsian equation with n singular points has a group of symmetries acting (projectively) on its solutions, isomorphic to the Coxeter group  D n of order n !2 n −1 . For the hypergeometric equation n =3, so the group is of order 24 and is isomorphic to the symmetric group on 4 points, and was first described by Kummer . The isomorphism with the symmetric group is accidental and has no analogue for more than 3 singular points, and it is sometimes better to think of the group as an extension of the symmetric group on 3 points (acting as permutations of the 3 singular points) by a Klein 4-group (whose elements change the signs of the differences of the exponents at an even number of singular points). Kummer's group of 24 transformations is generated by the three transformations taking a solution F ( a , b ; c ; z ) to one of      F   (  a  ,  b  ;    1  +  a  +  b   -  c   ;   1  -  z   )       F   a  b      1  a  b   c     1  z      F(a,b;1+a+b-c;1-z)           (   1  -  z   )    -  b    F   (   c  -  a   ,  b  ;  c  ;    z   z  -  1     )        superscript    1  z     b    F     c  a   b  c    z    z  1       (1-z)^{-b}F\left(c-a,b;c;\tfrac{z}{z-1}\right)           F  1    2     (  a  ,  b  ;  c  ;  z  )    =       (   1  -  z   )    c  -  a  -  b      F  1    2     (   c  -  a   ,   c  -  b   ;  c  ;  z  )    Euler transformation          subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a  b  c  z        superscript    1  z     c  a  b     subscript   subscript  F  1   2      c  a     c  b   c  z    Euler transformation     {}_{2}F_{1}(a,b;c;z)=(1-z)^{c-a-b}\,{}_{2}F_{1}(c-a,c-b;c;z)\ \ \ \text{Euler transformation}     which correspond to the transpositions (12), (23), and (34) under an isomorphism with the symmetric group on 4 points 1, 2, 3, 4.

The notation        s  0    (  z  )    =    z  λ    (   1  +   𝒪   (  z  )     )           subscript  s  0   z      superscript  z  λ     1    𝒪  z       s_{0}(z)=z^{\lambda}(1+\mathcal{O}(z))     is also sometimes used. Note that the connection coefficients become Möbius transformations on the triangle maps.  Note that each triangle map is regular at z ∈ {0, 1, ∞} respectively, with        s  1    (  z  )    =     (   1  -  z   )   μ    (   1  +   𝒪   (   1  -  z   )     )           subscript  s  1   z      superscript    1  z   μ     1    𝒪    1  z        s_{1}(z)=(1-z)^{\mu}(1+\mathcal{O}(1-z))            s  ∞    (  z  )    =    z  ν    (   1  +   𝒪   (    1  z    )     )     .         subscript  s    z      superscript  z  ν     1    𝒪    1  z        s_{\infty}(z)=z^{\nu}(1+\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{1}{z})).   and        π  1    (   𝐂  ∖   {  0  ,  1  }    ,   z  0   )    →   G  L   (  2  ,  𝐂  )       normal-→     subscript  π  1      𝐂   0  1     subscript  z  0       G  L   2  𝐂      \pi_{1}(\mathbf{C}\setminus\{0,1\},z_{0})\to GL(2,\mathbf{C})     In the special case of λ, μ and ν real, with 0 ≤ λ,μ,ν 2 F 1 , the value of the solutions at the endpoint will differ from the starting point.  Two fundamental solutions of the hypergeometric equation are related to each other by a linear transformation; thus the monodromy is a mapping (group homomorphism):        1  /  k   +   1  /  l   +   1  /  m    >  1          1  k     1  l     1  m    1    1/k+1/l+1/m>1     where π 1 is the fundamental group . In other words, the monodromy is a two dimensional linear representation of the fundamental group. The monodromy group of the equation is the image of this map, i.e. the group generated by the monodromy matrices. If 1- a , c - a - b , a - b are non-integer rational numbers with denominators k , l , m then the monodromy group is finite if and only if        \Beta     (  b  ,   c  -  b   )   2    F  1    (  a  ,  b  ;  c  ;  z  )    =    ∫  0  1     x   b  -  1      (   1  -  x   )    c  -  b  -  1       (   1  -   z  x    )    -  a     d  x        \real    (  c  )    >    \real    (  b  )    >  0    ,     formulae-sequence      \Beta   subscript   b    c  b    2    subscript  F  1    a  b  c  z      superscript   subscript   0   1      superscript  x    b  1     superscript    1  x     c  b  1     superscript    1    z  x      a    d  x           \real  c     \real  b        0      \Beta(b,c-b)\,_{2}F_{1}(a,b;c;z)=\int_{0}^{1}x^{b-1}(1-x)^{c-b-1}(1-zx)^{-a}\,%

This was given by Euler in 1748 and implies Euler's and Pfaff's hypergeometric transformations.  Other representations, corresponding to other branches , are given by taking the same integrand, but taking the path of integration to be a closed Pochhammer cycle enclosing the singularities in various orders. Such paths correspond to the monodromy action.

Gauss' contiguous relations  The six functions      a  ,  b  ,  c     a  b  c    a,b,c     are called contiguous to .

Gauss' continued fraction  Gauss used the contiguous relations to give several ways to write a quotient of two hypergeometric functions as a continued fraction, for example:         F  1    2     (  a  ,  b  ;  c  ;  z  )    =     (   1  -  z   )    c  -  a  -  b     F  1    2     (   c  -  a   ,   c  -  b   ;  c  ;  z  )     .         subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a  b  c  z       superscript    1  z     c  a  b     subscript   subscript  F  1   2      c  a     c  b   c  z      {}_{2}F_{1}(a,b;c;z)=(1-z)^{c-a-b}{}_{2}F_{1}(c-a,c-b;c;z).     Transformation formulas  Transformation formulas relate two hypergeometric functions at different values of the argument z .  Fractional linear transformations  Euler's transformation is        F  1    2     (  a  ,  b  ;  c  ;  z  )    =     (   1  -  z   )    -  b     F  1    2     (  b  ,   c  -  a   ;  c  ;    z   z  -  1     )           subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a  b  c  z       superscript    1  z     b     subscript   subscript  F  1   2    b    c  a   c    z    z  1        {}_{2}F_{1}(a,b;c;z)=(1-z)^{-b}{}_{2}F_{1}\left(b,c-a;c;\tfrac{z}{z-1}\right)   It follows by combining the two Pfaff transformations        F  1    2     (  a  ,  b  ;  c  ;  z  )    =     (   1  -  z   )    -  a     F  1    2     (  a  ,   c  -  b   ;  c  ;    z   z  -  1     )           subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a  b  c  z       superscript    1  z     a     subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a    c  b   c    z    z  1        {}_{2}F_{1}(a,b;c;z)=(1-z)^{-a}{}_{2}F_{1}\left(a,c-b;c;\tfrac{z}{z-1}\right)           F  1    2     (  a  ,  b  ;   2  b   ;  z  )    =     (   1  -  z   )    -   a  2      F  1    2     (     1  2    a   ,   b  -     1  2    a    ;   b  +    1  2     ;    z  2     4  z   -  4    )           subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a  b    2  b   z       superscript    1  z       a  2      subscript   subscript  F  1   2        1  2   a     b      1  2   a      b    1  2       superscript  z  2       4  z   4        {}_{2}F_{1}(a,b;2b;z)=(1-z)^{-\frac{a}{2}}{}_{2}F_{1}\left(\tfrac{1}{2}a,b-%

For extension of Euler's first and second transformations, see papers by Rathie & Paris and Rakha & Rathie.  Quadratic transformations  If two of the numbers 1 − c , c − 1, a − b , b − a , a + b − c , c − a − b are equal or one of them is 1/2 then there is a quadratic transformation of the hypergeometric function, connecting it to a different value of z related by a quadratic equation. The first examples were given by , and a complete list was given by . A typical example is        F  1    2     (     3  2    a   ,     1  2     (    3  a   -  1   )    ;   a  +    1  2     ;   -     z  2   3     )    =      (   1  +  z   )    1  -   3  a       F  1    2     (   a  -    1  3     ,  a  ,   2  a   ,   2  z   (   3  +   z  2    )     (   1  +  z   )    -  3     )           subscript   subscript  F  1   2        3  2   a       1  2       3  a   1      a    1  2         superscript  z  2   3         superscript    1  z     1    3  a      subscript   subscript  F  1   2      a    1  3    a    2  a     2  z    3   superscript  z  2     superscript    1  z     3         {}_{2}F_{1}\left(\tfrac{3}{2}a,\tfrac{1}{2}(3a-1);a+\tfrac{1}{2};-\tfrac{z^{2}%

 )^{-3}\right)     Higher order transformations  If 1− c , a − b , a + b − c differ by signs or two of them are 1/3 or −1/3 then there is a cubic transformation of the hypergeometric function, connecting it to a different value of z related by a cubic equation. The first examples were given by . A typical example is         F  1    2     (    1  4    ,    3  8    ;    7  8    ;  z  )     (       z  4   -   60   z  3     +   134   z  2     -   60  z    +  1   )    1  /  16     =    F  1    2     (    1  48    ,    17  48    ;    7  8    ;     -   432  z    (   z  -  1   )   2     (   z  +  1   )   8       (       z  4   -   60   z  3     +   134   z  2     -   60  z    +  1   )   3     )     .         subscript   subscript  F  1   2      1  4     3  8     7  8   z    superscript           superscript  z  4     60   superscript  z  3       134   superscript  z  2       60  z    1     1  16        subscript   subscript  F  1   2      1  48     17  48     7  8         432  z   superscript    z  1   2    superscript    z  1   8      superscript           superscript  z  4     60   superscript  z  3       134   superscript  z  2       60  z    1   3        {}_{2}F_{1}\left(\tfrac{1}{4},\tfrac{3}{8};\tfrac{7}{8};z\right)(z^{4}-60z^{3}%

Transformations of other degrees only exist if a , b , and c are certain rational numbers, see , e.g.         F  1    2     (  a  ,  b  ;  c  ;  1  )    =    Γ   (  c  )   Γ   (   c  -  a  -  b   )     Γ   (   c  -  a   )   Γ   (   c  -  b   )      ,    ℜ   (  c  )    >   ℜ   (   a  +  b   )        formulae-sequence       subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a  b  c  1        normal-Γ  c  normal-Γ    c  a  b      normal-Γ    c  a   normal-Γ    c  b          c       a  b       {}_{2}F_{1}(a,b;c;1)=\frac{\Gamma(c)\Gamma(c-a-b)}{\Gamma(c-a)\Gamma(c-b)},%

It includes the Vandermonde identity as a special case.  For the special case where      F  1    2     (   -  m   ,  b  ;  c  ;  1  )    =     (   c  -  b   )    (  m  )      (  c  )    (  m  )            subscript   subscript  F  1   2      m   b  c  1       subscript    c  b   m    subscript  c  m      {}_{2}F_{1}(-m,b;c;1)=\frac{(c-b)_{(m)}}{(c)_{(m)}}   ,        F  1    2     (  a  ,  b  ;    1  +  a   -  b   ;   -  1   )    =    Γ   (    1  +  a   -  b   )   Γ   (   1  +    1  2   a    )     Γ   (   1  +  a   )   Γ   (    1  +    1  2   a    -  b   )            subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a  b      1  a   b     1         normal-Γ      1  a   b   normal-Γ    1      1  2   a       normal-Γ    1  a   normal-Γ      1      1  2   a    b       {}_{2}F_{1}(a,b;1+a-b;-1)=\frac{\Gamma(1+a-b)\Gamma(1+\tfrac{1}{2}a)}{\Gamma(1%
 +a)\Gamma(1+\tfrac{1}{2}a-b)}     Dougall's formula generalizes this to the bilateral hypergeometric series at z = 1.  ===Kummer's theorem ( z = −1) === There are many cases where hypergeometric functions can be evaluated at z = −1 by using a quadratic transformation to change z = −1 to z = 1 and then using Gauss's theorem to evaluate the result. A typical example is Kummer's theorem, named for Ernst Kummer :       F  1    2     (  a  ,  b  ;    1  +  a   -  b   ;  z  )        subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a  b      1  a   b   z     \displaystyle{}_{2}F_{1}(a,b;1+a-b;z)     which follows from Kummer's quadratic transformations         F  1    2     (  a  ,  b  ;     1  2     (   1  +  a  +  b   )    ;    1  2    )    =    Γ   (   1  2   )   Γ   (    1  2    (   1  +  a  +  b   )    )     Γ   (    1  2    (   1  +  a   )    )   Γ   (    1  2    (   1  +  b   )    )      .         subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a  b      1  2     1  a  b      1  2         normal-Γ    1  2   normal-Γ      1  2     1  a  b       normal-Γ      1  2     1  a    normal-Γ      1  2     1  b        {}_{2}F_{1}\left(a,b;\tfrac{1}{2}\left(1+a+b\right);\tfrac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{%
 \Gamma(\tfrac{1}{2})\Gamma(\tfrac{1}{2}\left(1+a+b\right))}{\Gamma(\tfrac{1}{2%
 }\left(1+a)\right)\Gamma(\tfrac{1}{2}\left(1+b\right))}.     and Gauss's theorem by putting z = −1 in the first identity. For generalization of Kummer's summation, see a paper by Lavoie, et al.  ===Values at z = 1/2=== Gauss's second summation theorem is         F  1    2     (  a  ,   1  -  a   ;  c  ;    1  2    )    =    Γ   (    1  2   c   )   Γ   (    1  2    (   1  +  c   )    )     Γ   (    1  2    (   c  +  a   )    )   Γ   (    1  2    (    1  +  c   -  a   )    )      .         subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a    1  a   c    1  2         normal-Γ      1  2   c   normal-Γ      1  2     1  c       normal-Γ      1  2     c  a    normal-Γ      1  2       1  c   a        {}_{2}F_{1}\left(a,1-a;c;\tfrac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{\Gamma(\tfrac{1}{2}c)\Gamma%
 (\tfrac{1}{2}\left(1+c\right))}{\Gamma(\tfrac{1}{2}\left(c+a\right))\Gamma(%
 \tfrac{1}{2}\left(1+c-a\right))}.     Bailey's theorem is         F  1    2     (  a  ,   -  a   ;    1  2    ;     x  2    4   (   x  -  1   )      )    =      (   1  -  x   )   a   +    (   1  -  x   )    -  a     2    ,         subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a    a     1  2      superscript  x  2     4    x  1            superscript    1  x   a    superscript    1  x     a     2     {}_{2}F_{1}\left(a,-a;\tfrac{1}{2};\tfrac{x^{2}}{4(x-1)}\right)=\frac{(1-x)^{a%
 }+(1-x)^{-a}}{2},     For generalizations of Gauss's second summation theorem and Bailey's summation theorem, see a paper by Lavoie, et al.  Other points  There are many other formulas giving the hypergeometric function as an algebraic number at special rational values of the parameters, some of which are listed in  and . Some typical examples are given by        T  a    (   cos  x   )    =    F  1    2     (  a  ,   -  a   ;    1  2    ;     1  2     (   1  -   cos  x    )    )    =   cos   (   a  x   )             subscript  T  a     x       subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a    a     1  2       1  2     1    x                a  x       T_{a}(\cos x)={}_{2}F_{1}\left(a,-a;\tfrac{1}{2};\tfrac{1}{2}(1-\cos x)\right)%
 =\cos(ax)     which can be restated as  $$T_a(\cos x)={}_2F_1\left(a,-a;\tfrac{1}{2};\tfrac{1}{2}(1-\cos x)\right)=\cos(a x)$$  whenever −π p H p are similar to generalized hypergeometric series, but summed over all integers   Binomial series  1 F 0  Confluent hypergeometric series  1 F 1 ( a ; c ; z )  Elliptic hypergeometric series where the ratio of terms is an elliptic function of the index  Euler hypergeometric integral , an integral representation of 2 F 1  Fox H-function , an extension of the Meijer G-function  Fox–Wright function , a generalization of the generalized hypergeometric function  Frobenius solution to the hypergeometric equation  General hypergeometric function introduced by I.
