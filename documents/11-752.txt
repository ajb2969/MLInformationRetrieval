N-carbamoyl-D-amino acid hydrolase




N-carbamoyl-D-amino acid hydrolase

In enzymology, a N-carbamoyl-D-amino acid hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-carbamoyl-D-amino acid + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-amino acid + NH3 + CO2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-carbamoyl-D-amino acid and H2O, whereas its 3 products are D-amino acid, NH3, and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ''.
