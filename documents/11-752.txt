   N-carbamoyl-D-amino acid hydrolase      N-carbamoyl-D-amino acid hydrolase   In enzymology , a N-carbamoyl-D-amino acid hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-carbamoyl-D-amino acid + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-amino acid + NH 3 + CO 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-carbamoyl-D-amino acid and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are D-amino acid , NH 3 , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ' '.  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
