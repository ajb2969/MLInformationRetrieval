   Koornwinder polynomials      Koornwinder polynomials  In mathematics, '''Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials''' (also called '''Koornwinder polynomials''') are a family of [[orthogonal polynomials]] in several variables, introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Tom H. Koornwinder|last=Koornwinder|year=1992}} and [[I. G. Macdonald]] (1987, important special cases), that generalize the [[Askey–Wilson polynomials]].  They are the [[ Macdonald polynomials]] attached to the non-reduced affine root system of type ( C , C n ), and in particular satisfy (, ) analogues of Macdonald's conjectures . In addition Jan Felipe van Diejen showed that the Macdonald polynomials associated to any classical root system can be expressed as limits or special cases of Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials and found complete sets of concrete commuting difference operators diagonalized by them . Furthermore there is a large class of interesting families of multivariable orthogonal polynomials associated with classical root systems which are degenerate cases of the Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials . The Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials have also been studied with the aid of affine Hecke algebras (, , ).  The Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomial in n variables associated to the partition λ is the unique Laurent polynomial invariant under permutation and inversion of variables, with leading monomial  x λ , and orthogonal with respect to the density         |  a  |   ,   |  b  |   ,   |  c  |   ,   |  d  |   ,   |  q  |   ,   |  t  |    <  1   ,         a     b     c     d     q     t    1    |a|,|b|,|c|,|d|,|q|,|t|<1,   ,  where the parameters satisfy the constraints  $$|a|,|b|,|c|,|d|,|q|,|t|<1,$$  and ( x ; q ) ∞ denotes the infinite q-Pochhammer symbol . Here leading monomial x λ means that μ≤λ for all terms x μ with nonzero coefficient, where μ≤λ if and only if μ 1 ≤λ 1 , μ 1 +μ 2 ≤λ 1 +λ 2 , …, μ 1 +…+μ n ≤λ 1 +…+λ n . Under further constraints that q and t are real and that a , b , c , d are real or, if complex, occur in conjugate pairs, the given density is positive.
