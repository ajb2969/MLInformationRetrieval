   Invariant polynomial      Invariant polynomial   In mathematics , an invariant polynomial is a polynomial    P   P   P   that is invariant under a group    Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma    acting on a vector space    V   V   V   . Therefore   P   P   P   is a   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   -invariant polynomial if       P   (   γ  x   )    =   P   (  x  )          P    γ  x      P  x     P(\gamma x)=P(x)     for all    γ  ∈  Γ      γ  normal-Γ    \gamma\in\Gamma   and    x  ∈  V      x  V    x\in V   .  Cases of particular importance are for Γ a finite group (in the theory of Molien series , in particular), a compact group , a Lie group or algebraic group . For a basis-independent definition of 'polynomial' nothing is lost by referring to the symmetric powers of the given linear representation of Γ.
