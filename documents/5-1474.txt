Invariant polynomial

In mathematics, an invariant polynomial is a polynomial

 
  that is invariant under a group

acting on a vector space

 
 . Therefore 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -invariant polynomial if



for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Cases of particular importance are for Γ a finite group (in the theory of Molien series, in particular), a compact group, a Lie group or algebraic group. For a basis-independent definition of 'polynomial' nothing is lost by referring to the symmetric powers of the given linear representation of Γ.
