   UDP-glucuronate 5'-epimerase      UDP-glucuronate 5'-epimerase   In enzymology , an UDP-glucuronate 5'-epimerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucuronate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP-L-iduronate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , UDP-glucuronate , and one product , UDP-L-iduronate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on carbohydrates and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucuronate 5'-epimerase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucuronate 5'-epimerase , UDP-glucuronic acid 5'-epimerase , and C-5-uronosyl epimerase . This enzyme participates in nucleotide sugars metabolism . It employs one cofactor , NAD+ .
