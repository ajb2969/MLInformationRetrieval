   Accidental release source terms      Accidental release source terms   Accidental release source terms are the mathematical equations that quantify the flow rate at which accidental releases of air pollutants into the ambient environment can occur at industrial facilities such as petroleum refineries , petrochemical plants, natural gas processing plants, oil and gas transportation pipelines , chemical plants, and many other industrial activities. Governmental regulations in many countries require that the probability of such accidental releases be analyzed and their quantitative impact upon the environment and human health be determined so that mitigating steps can be planned and implemented.  There are a number of mathematical calculation methods for determining the flow rate at which gaseous and liquid pollutants might be released from various types of accidents. Such calculational methods are referred to as source terms , and this article on accidental release source terms explains some of the calculation methods used for determining the mass flow rate at which gaseous pollutants may be accidentally released.  Accidental release of pressurized gas  When gas stored under pressure in a closed vessel is discharged to the atmosphere through a hole or other opening, the gas velocity through that opening may be choked (i.e., it has attained a maximum) or it may be non-choked.  Choked velocity, also referred to as sonic velocity, occurs when the ratio of the absolute source pressure to the absolute downstream pressure is equal to or greater than [( k + 1) ÷ 2 ] k ÷( k - 1 ) , where k is the specific heat ratio of the discharged gas (sometimes called the isentropic expansion factor and sometimes denoted as   γ   γ   \gamma   ).  For many gases, k ranges from about 1.09 to about 1.41, and therefore [( k + 1) ÷ 2 ] k ÷( k - 1 ) ranges from 1.7 to about 1.9, which means that choked velocity usually occurs when the absolute source vessel pressure is at least 1.7 to 1.9 times as high as the absolute downstream ambient atmospheric pressure.  When the gas velocity is choked, the equation for the mass flow rate in SI metric units is: 1 2 3 4       Q   =    C    A      k    ρ    P     (   2   k  +  1    )     (   k  +  1   )   /   (   k  -  1   )            Q    C  A      k  ρ  P   superscript    2    k  1        k  1     k  1          Q\;=\;C\;A\;\sqrt{\;k\;\rho\;P\;\bigg(\frac{2}{k+1}\bigg)^{(k+1)/(k-1)}}     or this equivalent form:       Q   =    C    A    P      (     k   M     Z    R   T    )     (   2   k  +  1    )     (   k  +  1   )   /   (   k  -  1   )            Q    C  A  P          k  M     Z  R  T     superscript    2    k  1        k  1     k  1          Q\;=\;C\;A\;P\;\sqrt{\bigg(\frac{\;\,k\;M}{Z\;R\;T}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{2}{k+1}%
 \bigg)^{(k+1)/(k-1)}}     For the above equations, it is important to note that although the gas velocity reaches a maximum and becomes choked, the mass flow rate is not choked . The mass flow rate can still be increased if the source pressure is increased.  Whenever the ratio of the absolute source pressure to the absolute downstream ambient pressure is less than [ ( k + 1 ) ÷ 2 ] k ÷ ( k - 1 ) , then the gas velocity is non-choked (i.e., sub-sonic) and the equation for mass flow rate is:       Q   =    C    A      2    ρ    P    (   k   k  -  1    )    [     (     P   A   P   )    2  /  k    -     (     P   A   P   )     (   k  +  1   )   /  k      ]          Q    C  A      2  ρ  P    k    k  1     delimited-[]     superscript     subscript  P  A   P     2  k     superscript     subscript  P  A   P       k  1   k           Q\;=\;C\;A\;\sqrt{\;2\;\rho\;P\;\bigg(\frac{k}{k-1}\bigg)\Bigg[\,\bigg(\frac{%

The initial instantaneous flow rate from a leak in a pressurized gas system or vessel is much higher than the average flow rate during the overall release period because the pressure and flow rate decrease with time as the system or vessel empties. Calculating the flow rate versus time since the initiation of the leak is much more complicated, but more accurate. Two equivalent methods for performing such calculations are presented and compared at www.air-dispersion.com/feature2.html .  The technical literature can be very confusing because many authors fail to explain whether they are using the universal gas law constant R which applies to any ideal gas or whether they are using the gas law constant R s which only applies to a specific individual gas. The relationship between the two constants is R s = R / M .  Notes: * The above equations are for a real gas.   For an ideal gas, Z = 1 and ρ is the ideal gas density.  1 kilomole (kmol) = 1000 moles = 1000 gram-moles = kilogram-mole.   Ramskill's equation for non-choked mass flow  P.K. Ramskill's equation 5 6 for the non-choked flow of an ideal gas is shown below as equation (1):  (1)    Q  =    C     ρ  A     A        2   P   ρ   ⋅   k   k  -  1    ⋅   [   1  -    (    P  A   P   )     (  k  -  1  )   /  k  )     ]          Q    C   subscript  ρ  A   A     normal-⋅      2  P   ρ     k    k  1     delimited-[]    1   superscript     subscript  P  A   P    fragments   fragments  normal-(  k   1  normal-)    k  normal-)           Q=C\;\rho_{A}\;A\;\sqrt{\frac{\;\,2\;P}{\rho}\cdot\frac{k}{k-1}\cdot{\Bigg[\;1%

Evaporation of non-boiling liquid pool  Three different methods of calculating the rate of evaporation from a non-boiling liquid pool are presented in this section. The results obtained by the three methods are somewhat different.  The U.S. Air Force method  The following equations are for predicting the rate at which liquid evaporates from the surface of a pool of liquid which is at or near the ambient temperature. The equations were derived from field tests performed by the U.S. Air Force with pools of liquid hydrazine. 8      E  =    (   4.161  ×   10   -  5     )   ⋅   u  0.75   ⋅   T  F   ⋅  M  ⋅   (    P  S   /   P  H    )        E   normal-⋅    4.161   superscript  10    5      superscript  u  0.75    subscript  T  F   M     subscript  P  S    subscript  P  H       E=(4.161\times{10^{-5}})\cdot u^{0.75}\cdot T_{F}\cdot M\cdot(P_{S}/P_{H})         where:        E   = evaporation flux, (kg/min)/m² of pool surface     u   = windspeed just above the liquid surface, m/s     T A   = absolute ambient temperature, K     T F   = pool liquid temperature correction factor, dimensionless     T P   = pool liquid temperature, °C     M   = pool liquid molecular weight, dimensionless     P S   = pool liquid vapor pressure at ambient temperature, mmHg     P H   = hydrazine vapor pressure at ambient temperature, mmHg (see equation below)      If T P = 0 °C or less, then T F = 1.0  If T P > 0 °C, then T F = 1.0 + 0.0043 T P 2       P  H   =   760  ⋅   e    65.3319  -   (   7245.2  /   T  A    )   -   (    8.22    ln   T  a     )    +   (    0.0061557    T  A    )           subscript  P  H    normal-⋅  760   superscript  e      65.3319    7245.2   subscript  T  A      8.22     subscript  T  a        0.0061557   subscript  T  A         P_{H}=760\cdot e^{65.3319-(7245.2/T_{A})-(8.22\;\ln T_{a})+(0.0061557\;T_{A})}         where:           e   e   e      = 2.7183, the base of the natural logarithm system        ln     \ln      = natural logarithm     The U.S. EPA method  The following equations are for predicting the rate at which liquid evaporates from the surface of a pool of liquid which is at or near the ambient temperature.

When such a liquefied gas is released into the ambient atmosphere, the resultant reduction of pressure causes some of the liquefied gas to vaporize immediately. This is known as "adiabatic flashing" and the following equation, derived from a simple heat balance, is used to predict how much of the liquefied gas is vaporized.
