   Limonene-1,2-epoxide hydrolase      Limonene-1,2-epoxide hydrolase   In enzymology , a limonene-1,2-epoxide hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   limonene-1,2-epoxide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   limonene-1,2-diol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are limonene-1,2-epoxide and H 2 O , whereas its product is limonene-1,2-diol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on ether bonds (ether hydrolases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is limonene-1,2-epoxide hydrolase . This enzyme is also called limonene oxide hydrolase . This enzyme participates in limonene and pinene degradation.  Epoxide hydrolases catalyse the hydrolysis of epoxides to corresponding diols , which is important in detoxification , synthesis of signal molecules, or metabolism . Limonene-1,2- epoxide hydrolase (LEH) differs from many other epoxide hydrolases in its structure and its novel one-step catalytic mechanism. Its main fold consists of a six-stranded mixed beta-sheet , with three N-terminal  alpha helices packed to one side to create a pocket that extends into the protein core. A fourth helix lies in such a way that it acts as a rim to this pocket. Although mainly lined by hydrophobic  residues , this pocket features a cluster of polar groups that lie at its deepest point and constitute the enzymes  active site . 1  References  Further reading      "  Category:Protein domains  Category:EC 3.3.2  Category:Enzymes of known structure     ↩
