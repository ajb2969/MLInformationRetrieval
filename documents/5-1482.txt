   Continuous linear operator      Continuous linear operator   In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics , a continuous linear operator or continuous linear mapping is a continuous  linear transformation between topological vector spaces .  An operator between two normed spaces is a bounded linear operator if and only if it is a continuous linear operator.  Properties  A continuous linear operator maps bounded sets into bounded sets. A linear functional is continuous if and only if its kernel is closed. Every linear function on a finite-dimensional space is continuous.  The following are equivalent: given a linear operator A between topological spaces X and Y :   A is continuous at 0 in X .  A is continuous at some point    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   in X .  A is continuous everywhere in X .   The proof uses the facts that the translation of an open set in a linear topological space is again an open set, and the equality         A   -  1     (  D  )    +   x  0    =    A   -  1     (   D  +   A   x  0     )             superscript  A    1    D    subscript  x  0       superscript  A    1      D    A   subscript  x  0        A^{-1}(D)+x_{0}=A^{-1}(D+Ax_{0})\,\!   for any set D in Y and any x 0 in X , which is true due to the additivity of A .
