   Accumulation function      Accumulation function   The accumulation function  a ( t ) is a function defined in terms of time t expressing the ratio of the value at time t ( future value ) and the initial investment ( present value ). It is used in interest theory .  Thus a (0)=1 and the value at time t is given by:       A   (  t  )    =    k  ⋅  a    (  t  )          A  t      normal-⋅  k  a   t     A(t)=k\cdot a(t)   . where the initial investment is k .  Examples:   simple interest      a   (  t  )    =   1  +   t  ⋅  i          a  t     1   normal-⋅  t  i      a(t)=1+t\cdot i     compound interest      a   (  t  )    =    (   1  +  i   )   t         a  t    superscript    1  i   t     a(t)=(1+i)^{t}     simple discount      a   (  t  )    =    (   1  -   d  ⋅  t    )    -  1          a  t    superscript    1   normal-⋅  d  t      1      a(t)=(1-d\cdot t)^{-1}     compound discount      a   (  t  )    =    (   1  -  d   )    -  t          a  t    superscript    1  d     t      a(t)=(1-d)^{-t}      In the case of a positive rate of return , as in the case of interest, the accumulation function is an increasing function .  Variable rate of return  The logarithmic or continuously compounded return , sometimes called force of interest , is a function of time defined as follows:       δ  t   =      a  ′    (  t  )     a   (  t  )           subscript  δ  t        superscript  a  normal-′   t     a  t      \delta_{t}=\frac{a^{\prime}(t)}{a(t)}\,     which is the rate of change with time of the natural logarithm of the accumulation function.  Conversely:       a   (  t  )    =   e     ∫  0  t       δ  u    d  u           a  t    superscript  e    superscript   subscript   0   t      subscript  δ  u   d  u       a(t)=e^{\int_{0}^{t}\delta_{u}\,du}     reducing to       a   (  t  )    =   e   t  δ          a  t    superscript  e    t  δ      a(t)=e^{t\delta}   for constant   δ   δ   \delta   .  The effective annual percentage rate at any time is:       r   (  t  )    =    e   δ  t    -  1         r  t      superscript  e   subscript  δ  t    1     r(t)=e^{\delta_{t}}-1     See also   Time value of money   "  Category:Mathematical finance
