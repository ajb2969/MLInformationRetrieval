Inertial manifold

In mathematics, inertial manifolds are concerned with the long term behavior of the solutions of dissipative dynamical systems. Inertial manifolds are finite-dimensional, smooth, invariant manifolds that contain the global attractor and attract all solutions exponentially quickly. Since an inertial manifold is finite-dimensional even if the original system is infinite-dimensional, and because most of the dynamics for the system takes place on the inertial manifold, studying the dynamics on an inertial manifold produces a considerable simplification in the study of the dynamics of the original system.1
In many physical applications, inertial manifolds express an interaction law between the small and large wavelength structures. Some say that the small wavelengths are enslaved by the large (e.g. synergetics). Inertial manifolds may also appear as slow manifolds common in meteorology, or as the center manifold in any bifurcation. Computationally, numerical schemes for partial differential equations seek to capture the long term dynamics and so such numerical schemes form an approximate inertial manifold.
Introductory Example
Consider the dynamical system in just two variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and with parameter 
 
 
 
 :2




It possesses the one dimensional inertial manifold 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  (a parabola).
This manifold is invariant under the dynamics because on the manifold 
 
 



 

=\frac{d}{dt}\frac{p^2}{1+2a}
\frac{2p\frac{dp}{dt}}{1+2a}
\frac{2ap^2}{1+2a}-\frac{2p^4}{(1+2a)^2} which is the same as

 

-\frac{p^2}{1+2a}+p^2-2\left(\frac{p^2}{1+2a}\right)^2
\frac{2ap^2}{1+2a}-\frac{2p^4}{(1+2a)^2}.

The manifold 
 
 
 
  attracts all trajectories in some finite domain around the origin because near the origin 
 
 
 
  (although the strict definition below requires attraction from all initial conditions).

Hence the long term behavior of the original two dimensional dynamical system is given by the 'simpler' one dimensional dynamics on the inertial manifold 
 
 
 
 , namely 
 
 
 
 .
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  denote a solution of a dynamical system. The solution 
 
 
 
  may be an evolving vector in 
 
 
 
  or may be an evolving function in an infinite-dimensional Banach space 
 
 
 
 .
In many cases of interest the evolution of 
 
 
 
  is determined as the solution of a differential equation in 
 
 
 
 , say 
 
 
 
  with initial value 
 
 
 
 . In any case, we assume the solution of the dynamical system can be written in terms of a semigroup operator, or state transition matrix, 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for all times 
 
 
 
  and all initial values 
 
 
 
 . In some situations we might consider only discrete values of time as in the dynamics of a map.
An inertial manifold3 for a dynamical semigroup 
 
 
 
  is a smooth manifold 
 
 
 
  such that



 
  is of finite dimension,


 
  for all times 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  attracts all solutions exponentially quickly, that is, for every initial value 
 
 
 
  there exist constants 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .

The restriction of the differential equation 
 
 
 
  to the inertial manifold 
 
 
 
  is therefore a well defined finite-dimensional system called the inertial system.4 Subtly, there is a difference between a manifold being attractive, and solutions on the manifold being attractive. Nonetheless, under appropriate conditions the inertial system possesses so-called asymptotic completeness:5 that is, every solution of the differential equation has a companion solution lying in 
 
 
 
  and producing the same behavior for large time; in mathematics, for all 
 
 
 
  there exists 
 
 
 
  and possibly a time shift 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 .
Researchers in the 2000s generalized such inertial manifolds to time dependent (nonautonomous) and/or stochastic dynamical systems (e.g.67)
Existence
Existence results that have been proved address inertial manifolds that are expressible as a graph.8 The governing differential equation is rewritten more specifically in the form 
 
 
 
  for unbounded self-adjoint closed operator 
 
 
 
  with domain 
 
 
 
 , and nonlinear operator 
 
 
 
 . Typically, elementary spectral theory gives an orthonormal basis of 
 
 
 
  consisting of eigenvectors 
 
 

 
 , 
 
 
 
 , for ordered eigenvalues 
 
 
 
 .
For some given number 
 
 
 
  of modes, 
 
 
 
  denotes the projection of 
 
 
 
  onto the space spanned by 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  denotes the orthogonal projection onto the space spanned by 
 
 
 
 . We look for an inertial manifold expressed as the graph 
 
 
 
 . For this graph to exist the most restrictive requirement is the spectral gap condition9 
 
 
 
  where the constant 
 
 
 
  depends upon the system. This spectral gap condition requires that the spectrum of 
 
 
 
  must contain large gaps to be guaranteed of existence.
Approximate inertial manifolds
Several methods are proposed to construct approximations to inertial manifolds,10 including the so-called intrinsic low-dimensional manifolds.1112
The most popular way to approximate follows from the existence of a graph. Define the 
 
 
slow variables 
 
 
 
 , and the 'infinite' fast variables 
 
 
 
 . Then project the differential equation 
 
 
 
  onto both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to obtain the coupled system 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
For trajectories on the graph of an inertial manifold 
 
 
 
 , the fast variable 
 
 
 
 . Differentiating and using the coupled system form gives the differential equation for the graph:


 
  This differential equation is typically solved approximately in an asymptotic expansion in 'small' 
 
 
 
  to give an invariant manifold model,13 or a nonlinear Galerkin method,14 both of which use a global basis whereas the so-called holistic discretisation uses a local basis.15 Such approaches to approximation of inertial manifolds are very closely related to approximating center manifolds for which a web service exists to construct approximations for systems input by a user.5
