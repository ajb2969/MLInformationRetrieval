   6-O-methylnorlaudanosoline 5'-O-methyltransferase      6-O-methylnorlaudanosoline 5'-O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a 6-O-methylnorlaudanosoline 5'-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 6-O-methylnorlaudanosoline   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + nororientaline   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 6-O-methylnorlaudanosoline , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and nororientaline .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:6-O-methylnorlaudanosoline 5'-O-methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis i .
