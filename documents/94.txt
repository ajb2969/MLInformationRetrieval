   Weighted geometric mean      Weighted geometric mean   In statistics , given a set of data,      X  =   {   x  1   ,    x  2   …   ,   x  n   }       X    subscript  x  1      subscript  x  2   normal-…    subscript  x  n      X=\{x_{1},x_{2}\dots,x_{n}\}     and corresponding weights ,      W  =   {   w  1   ,   w  2   ,  …  ,   w  n   }       W    subscript  w  1    subscript  w  2   normal-…   subscript  w  n      W=\{w_{1},w_{2},\dots,w_{n}\}     the weighted geometric mean is calculated as       x  ¯   =    (   ∏   i  =  1   n    x  i   w  i    )    1  /     ∑   i  =  1   n     w  i      =  exp   (     ∑   i  =  1   n     w  i    ln   x  i        ∑   i  =  1   n    w  i     )      fragments   normal-¯  x     superscript   fragments  normal-(   superscript   subscript  product    i  1    n    superscript   subscript  x  i    subscript  w  i    normal-)     1    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  w  i          fragments  normal-(      superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  w  i      subscript  x  i       fragments   superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  w  i      normal-)     \bar{x}=\left(\prod_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{w_{i}}\right)^{1/\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}}=%
 \quad\exp\left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}\ln x_{i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}\quad}\right)     Note that if all the weights are equal, the weighted geometric mean is the same as the geometric mean .  Weighted versions of other means can also be calculated. Probably the best known weighted mean is the weighted arithmetic mean, usually simply called the weighted mean . Another example of a weighted mean is the weighted harmonic mean .  The second form above illustrates that the logarithm of the geometric mean is the weighted arithmetic mean of the logarithms of the individual values.
