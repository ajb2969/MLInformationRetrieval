   Sound exposure      Sound exposure   Sound exposure is the integral, over time, of squared sound pressure . The SI unit of sound exposure is the pascal squared second (Pa 2 ·s).  Mathematical definition  Sound exposure, denoted E , is defined by       E  =    ∫   t  0    t  1     p     (  t  )   2    d  t     ,      E    superscript   subscript    subscript  t  0     subscript  t  1      p   superscript  t  2   normal-d  t      E=\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}p(t)^{2}\,\mathrm{d}t,   where   the exposure is being calculated for the time interval between times t 0 and t 1 ;  p(t) is the sound pressure at time t , usually A-weighted for sound in air.   Sound exposure level  Sound exposure level (SEL) or acoustic exposure level is a logarithmic measure of the sound exposure of a sound relative to a reference value. Sound exposure level, denoted L E and measured in dB , is defined by 1        L  E   =    1  2     ln    (   E   E  0    )    Np   =      log  10     (   E   E  0    )    B   =   10     log  10     (   E   E  0    )    dB    ,         subscript  L  E       1  2       E   subscript  E  0     Np            subscript   10     E   subscript  E  0     normal-B          10    subscript   10     E   subscript  E  0     dB      L_{E}=\frac{1}{2}\ln\!\left(\frac{E}{E_{0}}\right)\!~{}\mathrm{Np}=\log_{10}\!%
 \left(\frac{E}{E_{0}}\right)\!~{}\mathrm{B}=10\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{E}{E_{0}}%
 \right)\!~{}\mathrm{dB},   where   E is the sound exposure;  E 0 is the reference sound exposure;   is the neper ;   is the bel ;   is the decibel .   The commonly used reference sound exposure in air is 2        E  0   =     400   μ   Pa  2    ⋅  s    .       subscript  E  0    normal-⋅    400  μ   superscript  Pa  2    normal-s     E_{0}=400~{}\mathrm{\mu Pa^{2}\cdot s}.   The proper notations for sound exposure level using this reference are or , but the notations , , dBSEL, or dB SEL are very common, even if they are not accepted by the SI. 3  References  "  Category:Acoustics  Category:Sound  Category:Sound measurements  Category:Physical quantities     "Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology – Part 3: Logarithmic and related quantities, and their units" , IEC 60027-3 Ed. 3.0 , International Electrotechnical Commission, 19 July 2002. ↩  Ross Roeser, Michael Valente, Audiology: Diagnosis (Thieme 2007), p. 240. ↩  Thompson, A. and Taylor, B.
