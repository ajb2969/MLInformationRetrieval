   Phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase      Phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   phenylacetaldehyde + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phenylacetate + NADH + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are phenylacetaldehyde , NAD + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are phenylacetate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phenylacetaldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in phenylalanine metabolism and styrene degradation .
