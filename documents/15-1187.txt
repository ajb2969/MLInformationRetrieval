Ferric-chelate reductase (NADPH)

Ferric-chelate reductase (NADPH) (, ferric chelate reductase, iron chelate reductase, NADPH:Fe3+-EDTA reductase, NADPH-dependent ferric reductase, yqjH (gene)) is an enzyme with system name Fe(II):NADP+ oxidoreductase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2 Fe(II) + 2 apo-siderophore + NADP+ + H+

 
  2 Fe(III)-siderophore + NADPH
 

Ferric-chelate reductase contains FAD.
