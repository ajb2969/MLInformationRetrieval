   Ferric-chelate reductase (NADPH)      Ferric-chelate reductase (NADPH)   Ferric-chelate reductase (NADPH) (, ferric chelate reductase , iron chelate reductase , NADPH:Fe 3+ -EDTA reductase , NADPH-dependent ferric reductase , yqjH (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name Fe(II):NADP + oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2 Fe(II) + 2 apo-siderophore + NADP + + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 Fe(III)-siderophore + NADPH   Ferric-chelate reductase contains FAD.
