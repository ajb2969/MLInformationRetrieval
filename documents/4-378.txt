   Planck energy      Planck energy   In physics , Planck energy , denoted by , is the unit of energy in the system of natural units known as Planck units .       E  P   =     ℏ   c  5    G    ≈    1.956  ×    10  9     J   ≈    1.22  ×    10  28     eV   ≈    0.5433   MWh          subscript  E  normal-P         Planck-constant-over-2-pi   superscript  c  5    G             1.956   superscript  10  9    normal-J            1.22   superscript  10  28    eV          0.5433  MWh      E_{\mathrm{P}}=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^{5}}{G}}\approx 1.956\times 10^{9}\ \mathrm%

An equivalent definition is:        E  P   =   ℏ   t  P     ,       subscript  E  normal-P     Planck-constant-over-2-pi   subscript  t  normal-P      E_{\mathrm{P}}={\frac{\hbar}{t_{\mathrm{P}}}},     where is the Planck time .  Also:        E  P   =    m  P    c  2     ,       subscript  E  normal-P      subscript  m  normal-P    superscript  c  2      E_{\mathrm{P}}={m_{\mathrm{P}}}{c^{2}},     where is the Planck mass .  The ultra-high-energy cosmic rays observed in 1991 had a measured energy of about 50 joules , equivalent to about 2.5×10 −8  . Most Planck units are fantastically small and thus are unrelated to "macroscopic" phenomena (or fantastically large, as in the case of Planck density ). One , on the other hand, is definitely macroscopic, approximately equaling the energy stored in an automobile gas tank (57.2 L of gasoline at 34.2 MJ/L of chemical energy).  Planck units are designed to normalize the physical constants , , and to 1. Hence given Planck units, the mass-energy equivalence  simplifies to , so that the Planck energy and mass are numerically identical. In the equations of general relativity , is often multiplied by 8π. Hence writings in particle physics and physical cosmology often normalize to 1. This normalization results in the reduced Planck energy , defined as:          ℏ   c  5     8  π  G     ≈    0.390  ×    10  9     J   ≈    2.43  ×    10  18     GeV    .
