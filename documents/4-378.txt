Planck energy

In physics, Planck energy, denoted by , is the unit of energy in the system of natural units known as Planck units.



where  is the speed of light in a vacuum,  is the reduced Planck's constant, and  is the gravitational constant.  is a derived, as opposed to basic, Planck unit.
An equivalent definition is:



where  is the Planck time.
Also:



where  is the Planck mass.
The ultra-high-energy cosmic rays observed in 1991 had a measured energy of about 50 joules, equivalent to about 2.5×10−8 . Most Planck units are fantastically small and thus are unrelated to "macroscopic" phenomena (or fantastically large, as in the case of Planck density). One , on the other hand, is definitely macroscopic, approximately equaling the energy stored in an automobile gas tank (57.2 L of gasoline at 34.2 MJ/L of chemical energy).
Planck units are designed to normalize the physical constants, , and  to 1. Hence given Planck units, the mass-energy equivalence  simplifies to , so that the Planck energy and mass are numerically identical. In the equations of general relativity,  is often multiplied by 8π. Hence writings in particle physics and physical cosmology often normalize  to 1. This normalization results in the reduced Planck energy, defined as:
