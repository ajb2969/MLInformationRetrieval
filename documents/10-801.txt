   MRNA (2'-O-methyladenosine-N6-)-methyltransferase      MRNA (2'-O-methyladenosine-N6-)-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a mRNA (2'-O-methyladenosine-N6-)-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + m 7 G(5')pppAm   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + m 7 G(5')pppm 6 Am (mRNA containing an N 6 ,2'-O-dimethyladenosine cap)   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and m7G(5')pppAm , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and m7G(5')pppm6Am (mRNA containing an N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine cap) .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:mRNA (2'-O-methyladenosine-N6-)-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include messenger ribonucleate 2'-O-methyladenosine NG-methyltransferase , S-adenosyl-L-methionine:mRNA , and (2'-O-methyladenosine-6-N-)-methyltransferase .
