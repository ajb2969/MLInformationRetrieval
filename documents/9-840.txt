   Content (measure theory)      Content (measure theory)   In mathematics , a content is a real function    Œº   Œº   \mu   defined on a field of sets    ùíú   ùíú   \mathcal{A}   such that         Œº   (  A  )    ‚àà    [  0  ,  ‚àû  ]   whenever  A   ‚àà  ùíú   .          Œº  A      0    whenever  A        ùíú     \mu(A)\in\ [0,\infty]\mbox{ whenever }A\in\mathcal{A}.          Œº   (  ‚àÖ  )    =  0.        Œº    0.    \mu(\varnothing)=0.            Œº   (    A  1   ‚à™   A  2    )    =    Œº   (   A  1   )    +   Œº   (   A  2   )   whenever   A  1      ,    A  2   ‚àà    ùíú  and   A  1    ‚à©   A  2    =  ‚àÖ    .     formulae-sequence      Œº     subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2         Œº   subscript  A  1      Œº   subscript  A  2   whenever   subscript  A  1           subscript  A  2       ùíú  and   subscript  A  1     subscript  A  2              \mu(A_{1}\cup A_{2})=\mu(A_{1})+\mu(A_{2})\mbox{ whenever }A_{1},A_{2}\in%
 \mathcal{A}\mbox{ and }A_{1}\cap A_{2}=\varnothing.      An example of a content is a measure , which is a œÉ -additive  content defined on a œÉ -field . Every (real-valued) measure is a content, but not vice versa. Contents give a good notion of integrating bounded functions on a space but can behave badly when integrating unbounded functions, while measures give a good notion of integrating unbounded functions.  Examples  An example of a content that is not a measure on a œÉ-algebra is the content on all subset of the positive integers that has value 1/ n on the integer n and is infinite on any infinite subset.  An example of a content on the positive integers that is always finite but is not a measure can be given as follows. Take a positive linear functional on the bounded sequences that is 0 if the sequence has only a finite number of nonzero elements and takes value 1 on the sequence 1, 1, 1, ...., so the functional in some sense gives an "average value" of any bounded sequence. (Such a functional cannot be constructed explicitly, but exists by the Hahn-Banach theorem.) Then the content of a set of positive integers is the average value of the sequence that is 1 on this set and 0 elsewhere. Informally, one can think of the content of a subset of integers as the "chance" that a randomly chosen integer lies in this subset (though this is not compatible with the usual definitions of chance in probability theory, which assume countable additivity).  Integration of bounded functions  In general integration of functions with respect to a content does not behave well. However there is a well-behaved notion of integration provided that the function is bounded and the total content of the space is finite, given as follows.  Suppose that the total content of a space is finite. If f is a bounded function on the space such that the inverse image of any open subset of the reals has a content, then we can define the integral of f with respect to the content as       ‚à´   f  d  Œª    =   lim    ‚àë   i  =  1   n    f   (   Œ±  i   )   Œª   (    f   -  1     (   A  i   )    )              f  d  Œª        superscript   subscript     i  1    n     f   subscript  Œ±  i   Œª     superscript  f    1     subscript  A  i         \int fd\lambda=\lim\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(\alpha_{i})\lambda(f^{-1}(A_{i}))   where the A i form a finite collections of disjoint half-open sets whose union covers the range of f , and Œ± i is any element of A i , and where the limit is taken as the diameters of the sets A i tend to 0.  Duals of spaces of bounded functions  Suppose that Œº is a measure on some space X . The bounded measurable functions on X form a Banach space with respect to the supremum norm. The positive elements of the dual of this space correspond to bounded contents Œª ŒøŒΩ Œß , with the value of Œª on f given by the integral ‚à´ f dŒª. Similarly one can form the space of essentially bounded functions, with the norm given by the essential supremum, and the positive elements of the dual of this space are given by bounded contents that vanish on sets of measure 0.  Construction of a measure from a content  There are several ways to construct a measure Œº from a content Œª on a topological space. This section gives one such method for locally compact Hausdorff spaces such that the content is defined on all compact subsets. In general the measure is not an extension of the content, as the content may fail to be countably additive, and the measure may even be identically zero even if the content is not.  First restrict the content to compact sets. This gives a function Œª of compact sets C with the following properties:        Œª   (  C  )    ‚àà   [  0  ,  ‚àû  ]         Œª  C    0      \lambda(C)\in\ [0,\infty]   for all compact sets C       Œª   (  ‚àÖ  )    =  0.        Œª    0.    \lambda(\varnothing)=0.          Œª   (   C  1   )    ‚â§   Œª   (   C  2   )   whenever   C  1    ‚äÇ   C  2           Œª   subscript  C  1      Œª   subscript  C  2   whenever   subscript  C  1          subscript  C  2      \lambda(C_{1})\leq\lambda(C_{2})\mbox{ whenever }C_{1}\subset C_{2}          Œª   (    C  1   ‚à™   C  2    )    ‚â§    Œª   (   C  1   )    +   Œª   (   C  2   )           Œª     subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2         Œª   subscript  C  1      Œª   subscript  C  2       \lambda(C_{1}\cup C_{2})\leq\lambda(C_{1})+\lambda(C_{2})   for all pairs of compact sets       Œª   (    C  1   ‚à™   C  2    )    =    Œª   (   C  1   )    +   Œª   (   C  2   )           Œª     subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2         Œª   subscript  C  1      Œª   subscript  C  2       \lambda(C_{1}\cup C_{2})=\lambda(C_{1})+\lambda(C_{2})   for all pairs of disjoint compact sets.   There are also examples of functions Œª as above not constructed from contents. An example is given by the construction of Haar measure on a locally compact group. One method of constructing such a Haar measure is to produce a left-invariant function Œª as above on the compact subsets of the group, which can then be extended to a left-invariant measure.  Definition on open sets  Given Œª as above, we define a function Œº on all open sets by       Œº   (  U  )    =    sup   C  ‚äÇ  U     Œª   (  C  )           Œº  U     subscript  supremum    C  U      Œª  C      \mu(U)=\sup_{C\subset U}\lambda(C)   . This has the following properties:        Œº   (  U  )    ‚àà   [  0  ,  ‚àû  ]         Œº  U    0      \mu(U)\in\ [0,\infty]          Œº   (  ‚àÖ  )    =  0.        Œº    0.    \mu(\varnothing)=0.          Œº   (   U  1   )    ‚â§   Œº   (   U  2   )   whenever   U  1    ‚äÇ   U  2           Œº   subscript  U  1      Œº   subscript  U  2   whenever   subscript  U  1          subscript  U  2      \mu(U_{1})\leq\mu(U_{2})\mbox{ whenever }U_{1}\subset U_{2}          Œº   (    ‚ãÉ  n    U  n    )    ‚â§    ‚äï  n    Œª   (   U  n   )           Œº    subscript   n    subscript  U  n       subscript  direct-sum  n     Œª   subscript  U  n       \mu(\bigcup_{n}U_{n})\leq\oplus_{n}\lambda(U_{n})   for any collection of open sets.       Œº   (    ‚ãÉ  n    U  n    )    =    ‚äï  n    Œª   (   U  n   )           Œº    subscript   n    subscript  U  n       subscript  direct-sum  n     Œª   subscript  U  n       \mu(\bigcup_{n}U_{n})=\oplus_{n}\lambda(U_{n})   for any collection of disjoint open sets   Definition on all sets  Given Œº as above, we extend the function Œº to all subsets of the topological space by       Œº   (  A  )    =    inf   A  ‚äÇ  U     Œº   (  U  )           Œº  A     subscript  infimum    A  U      Œº  U      \mu(A)=\inf_{A\subset U}\mu(U)   . This is an outer measure , in other words it has the following properties:        Œº   (  A  )    ‚àà   [  0  ,  ‚àû  ]         Œº  A    0      \mu(A)\in\ [0,\infty]          Œº   (  ‚àÖ  )    =  0.        Œº    0.    \mu(\varnothing)=0.          Œº   (   A  1   )    ‚â§   Œº   (   A  2   )   whenever   A  1    ‚äÇ   A  2           Œº   subscript  A  1      Œº   subscript  A  2   whenever   subscript  A  1          subscript  A  2      \mu(A_{1})\leq\mu(A_{2})\mbox{ whenever }A_{1}\subset A_{2}          Œº   (    ‚ãÉ  n    A  n    )    ‚â§    ‚äï  n    Œª   (   A  n   )           Œº    subscript   n    subscript  A  n       subscript  direct-sum  n     Œª   subscript  A  n       \mu(\bigcup_{n}A_{n})\leq\oplus_{n}\lambda(A_{n})   for any countable collection of sets.   Construction of a measure  The function Œº above is an outer measure on the family of all subsets. Therefore it becomes a measure when restricted to the measurable subsets for the outer measure, which are the subsets E such that Œº( X ) = Œº( X ‚à© E ) + Œº( X \ E ) for all subsets X . If the space is locally compact then every open set is measurable for this measure.  The measure Œº does not necessarily coincide with the content Œª on compact sets, However it does if Œª is regular in the sense that for any compact C , Œª( C ) is the inf of Œª( D ) for compact sets D containing C in their interiors.
