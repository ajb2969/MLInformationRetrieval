   Complex algebraic variety      Complex algebraic variety   (Figure)  The Riemann sphere is one of the simplest complex algebraic varieties.   In algebraic geometry, a complex algebraic variety is an algebraic variety (in the scheme sense or otherwise) over the field of complex numbers . 1  Chow's theorem  Chow's theorem states that a projective analytic variety; i.e., a closed analytic subvariety of the complex projective space     ℂ   𝐏  n       ℂ   superscript  𝐏  n     \mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^{n}   is an algebraic variety; it is usually simply referred to as a projective variety .  Relation with similar concepts  Not every complex analytic variety is algebraic, though.  References  "  Category:Algebraic varieties     Parshin, Alexei N., and Igor Rostislavovich Shafarevich, eds.
