   Cyanohydrin beta-glucosyltransferase      Cyanohydrin beta-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a cyanohydrin beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-D-glucose + (S)-4-hydroxymandelonitrile   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + (S)-4-hydroxymandelonitrile beta-D-glucoside   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-D-glucose and (S)-4-hydroxymandelonitrile , whereas its two products are UDP and (S)-4-hydroxymandelonitrile beta-D-glucoside .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-D-glucose:(S)-4-hydroxymandelonitrile beta-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-p-hydroxymandelonitrile , glucosyltransferase , UDP-glucose-p-hydroxymandelonitrile glucosyltransferase , uridine diphosphoglucose-cyanohydrin glucosyltransferase , uridine diphosphoglucose:aldehyde cyanohydrin , beta-glucosyltransferase , UDP-glucose:(S)-4-hydroxymandelonitrile beta-D-glucosyltransferase , UGT85B1 , and UDP-glucose:p-hydroxymandelonitrile-O-glucosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism and cyanoamino acid metabolism .  References         "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
