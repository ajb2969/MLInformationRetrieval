Georg Nöbeling

Georg August Nöbeling (12 November 1907 – 16 February 2008) was a German mathematician.
Born and raised in Lüdenscheid, Nöbeling studied mathematics and physics in Göttingen and Vienna where he was a student of Karl Menger and received his PhD in 1931 on a generalization of the embedding theorem, which for one special case can be visualized by the Menger sponge.1 Nöbeling worked and researched in Menger's Mathematical Colloquium with Kurt Gödel, Franz Alt, Abraham Wald, Olga Taussky-Todd and others.
In 1933, he moved to Erlangen where he obtained a professorship at the University of Erlangen in 1940. His work focused on analysis, topology, and geometry. 1968/1969 he solved Specker's theorem on Abelian groups.
As Rector (1962-1963) of the University of Erlangen he oversaw the merge with the business college in Nuremberg.2 He also served twice as the chairman of the German Mathematical Society and is a member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities. He celebrated his 100th birthday in 2007.34
