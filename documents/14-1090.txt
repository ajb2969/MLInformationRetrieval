   ASAI      ASAI   The Average Service Availability Index (ASAI) 1 2 is a reliability index commonly used by electric power  utilities . ASAI is calculated as      ASAI  =      ∑    N  i   ×  8760     -    ∑    U  i    N  i         ∑    N  i   ×  8760          ASAI           subscript  N  i   8760         subscript  U  i    subscript  N  i           subscript  N  i   8760       \mbox{ASAI}=\frac{\sum{N_{i}}\times 8760-\sum{U_{i}N_{i}}}{\sum{N_{i}}\times 8%
 760}     where    N  i     subscript  N  i    N_{i}   is the number of customers and    U  i     subscript  U  i    U_{i}   is the annual outage time (in hours) for location   i   i   i   . ASAI can be represented in relation to SAIDI (when the annual SAIDI is given in hours)      ASAI  =   1  -   SAIDI  8760        ASAI    1    SAIDI  8760      \mbox{ASAI}=1-\frac{\mbox{SAIDI}}{8760}     References  See also   ASAI  ASIDI  ASIFI  ASUI  CAIDI  CAIFI  CTAIDI  MAIFI  SAIDI  SAIFI   "  Category:Electric power distribution  Category:Reliability analysis     ↩  ↩
