   (2Z,6Z)-farnesyl diphosphate synthase      (2Z,6Z)-farnesyl diphosphate synthase   (2Z,6Z)-farnesyl diphosphate synthase (, cis,cis-farnesyl diphosphate synthase , Z,Z-FPP synthase , zFPS , Z,Z-farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase ) is an enzyme with system name dimethylallyl-diphosphate:isopentenyl-diphosphate cistransferase (adding 2 isopentenyl units) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   dimethylallyl diphosphate + 2 isopentenyl diphosphate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 diphosphate + (2Z,6Z)-farnesyl diphosphate   This enzyme was originally characterized from wild tomato .
