<h1>FairTax</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>FairTax</strong> is a proposal to <a href="tax_reform" title="wikilink">reform</a> the federal tax code of the United States. It would replace all <a href="Income_tax_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">federal income taxes</a> (including the <a href="alternative_minimum_tax" title="wikilink">alternative minimum tax</a>, <a href="corporate_tax_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">corporate income taxes</a>, and <a href="Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">capital gains taxes</a>), <a href="payroll_tax#United_States" title="wikilink">payroll taxes</a> (including <a href="Federal_Insurance_Contributions_Act_tax" title="wikilink">Social Security and Medicare taxes</a>), <a href="gift_tax" title="wikilink">gift taxes</a>, and <a href="Estate_tax_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">estate taxes</a> with a single broad national <a href="consumption_tax" title="wikilink">consumption tax</a> on retail sales. The <em>Fair Tax Act</em> (/) would apply a tax, once, at the point of purchase on all new <a href="Good_(economics)" title="wikilink">goods</a> and <a href="Service_(economics)" title="wikilink">services</a> for personal consumption. The proposal also calls for a monthly payment to all <a class="uri" href="family" title="wikilink">family</a> <a href="household" title="wikilink">households</a> of lawful U.S. residents as an advance rebate, or "prebate", of tax on purchases up to the poverty level.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> First introduced into the <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">United States Congress</a> in 1999, a number of congressional committees have heard testimony on the <a href="Bill_(proposed_law)" title="wikilink">bill</a>; however, it has not moved from committee and has yet to have any effect on the tax system. In recent years, a tax reform movement has formed behind the FairTax proposal.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Attention increased after <a href="talk_radio" title="wikilink">talk radio</a> personality <a href="Neal_Boortz" title="wikilink">Neal Boortz</a> and <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a> Congressman <a href="John_Linder" title="wikilink">John Linder</a> published <em><a href="The_FairTax_Book" title="wikilink">The FairTax Book</a></em> in 2005 and additional visibility was gained in the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_2008" title="wikilink">2008 presidential campaign</a>.</p>

<p>As defined in the proposed legislation, the tax rate is 23% for the first year. This percentage is based on the total amount paid including the tax ($23 out of every $100 spent in total). This would be equivalent to a 30% traditional <a href="Sales_taxes_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">U.S. sales tax</a> ($23 on top of every $77 spent—$100 total).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The rate would automatically adjust annually based on federal receipts in the previous fiscal year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> With the rebate taken into consideration, the FairTax would be <a href="progressive_tax" title="wikilink">progressive</a> on <a href="Consumption_(economics)" title="wikilink">consumption</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> but would also be <a href="regressive_tax" title="wikilink">regressive</a> on <a class="uri" href="income" title="wikilink">income</a> at higher income levels (as consumption falls as a percentage of income).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Opponents argue this would accordingly decrease the <a href="Tax_incidence" title="wikilink">tax burden</a> on <a href="American_upper_class" title="wikilink">high-income earners</a> and increase it on the <a href="American_middle_class" title="wikilink">middle class</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Supporters contend that the plan would effectively tax <a class="uri" href="wealth" title="wikilink">wealth</a>, increase <a href="purchasing_power" title="wikilink">purchasing power</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and decrease tax burdens by broadening the tax base.</p>

<p>The plan's supporters state that a consumption tax would increase <a href="Saving_(money)" title="wikilink">savings</a> and <a class="uri" href="investment" title="wikilink">investment</a>, ease <a href="compliance_cost" title="wikilink">tax compliance</a> and increase <a href="economic_growth" title="wikilink">economic growth</a>, increase incentives for <a href="international_business" title="wikilink">international business</a> to locate in the US and increase US competitiveness in <a href="international_trade" title="wikilink">international trade</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The plan is intended to increase cost transparency for funding the federal government.

<h2 id="legislative-overview-and-history">Legislative overview and history</h2>

<p> The legislation would remove the <a href="Internal_Revenue_Service" title="wikilink">Internal Revenue Service</a> (after three years), and establish Excise Tax and Sales Tax bureaus in the <a href="United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury" title="wikilink">Department of the Treasury</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The <a href="U.S._state" title="wikilink">states</a> are granted the primary authority for the collection of sales tax revenues and the remittance of such revenues to the Treasury. The plan was created by <a href="Americans_For_Fair_Taxation" title="wikilink">Americans For Fair Taxation</a>, an <a href="advocacy_group" title="wikilink">advocacy group</a> formed to change the tax system. The group states that, together with economists, it developed the plan and the name "Fair Tax", based on interviews, polls, and focus groups of the general public.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The FairTax legislation has been introduced in the House by Georgia <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republicans</a> <a href="John_Linder" title="wikilink">John Linder</a> (1999–2010) and <a href="Rob_Woodall" title="wikilink">Rob Woodall</a> (2011–2014),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> while being introduced in the Senate by Georgia Republican <a href="Saxby_Chambliss" title="wikilink">Saxby Chambliss</a> (2003–2014).</p>

<p>To become law, the bill will need to be included in a final version of tax legislation from the <a href="U.S._House_Committee_on_Ways_and_Means" title="wikilink">U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means</a>, pass both the House and the Senate, and finally be signed by the <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a>.

These included uncertainties as to the revenue that would be generated, and difficulties of enforcement and administration, which made this type of tax undesirable to recommend in their final report.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The panel did not examine the Fairtax as proposed in the legislation. The FairTax received visibility in the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_2008" title="wikilink">2008 presidential election</a> on the issue of taxes and the IRS, with several candidates supporting the bill.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> A poll in 2009 by <a href="Rasmussen_Reports" title="wikilink">Rasmussen Reports</a> found that 43% of Americans would support a national sales tax replacement, with 38% opposed to the idea; the sales tax was viewed as fairer by 52% of Republicans, 44% of Democrats, and 49% of unaffiliateds.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> President <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a> does not support the bill,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> arguing for more <a href="Barack_Obama_economic_policy#Taxation" title="wikilink">progressive changes</a> to the income and payroll tax systems.</p>
<h2 id="tax-rate">Tax rate</h2>

<p>The sales tax rate, as defined in the legislation for the first year, is 23% of the total payment including the tax ($23 of every $100 spent in total—calculated similar to income taxes). This would be equivalent to a 30% traditional U.S. sales tax ($23 on top of every $77 spent—$100 total, or $30 on top of every $100 spent—$130 total).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> After the first year of implementation, this rate is automatically adjusted annually using a predefined formula reflecting actual federal receipts in the previous fiscal year.</p>

<p>The <a href="effective_tax_rate" title="wikilink">effective tax rate</a> for any household would be variable due to the fixed monthly tax rebate that are used to rebate taxes paid on purchases up to the poverty level.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The tax would be levied on all U.S. retail sales for personal consumption on new <a href="Good_(economics)" title="wikilink">goods</a> and <a href="Service_(economics)" title="wikilink">services</a>. Critics argue that the sales tax rate defined in the legislation would not be revenue neutral (that is, it would collect less for the government than the current tax system), and thus would increase the <a href="budget_deficit" title="wikilink">budget deficit</a>, unless government spending were equally reduced.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sales-tax-rate">Sales tax rate</h3>

<p>During the first year of implementation, the FairTax legislation would apply a 23% federal <a href="Retailing" title="wikilink">retail</a> sales tax on the total transaction value of a purchase; in other words, consumers pay to the government 23 cents of every dollar spent in total (sometimes called <em><a class="uri" href="tax-inclusive" title="wikilink">tax-inclusive</a></em>, and presented this way to provide a direct comparison with individual income and employment taxes which reduce a person's available money <em>before</em> they can make purchases). The equivalent assessed tax rate is 30% if the FairTax is applied to the pre-tax price of a good like traditional <a href="Sales_taxes_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">U.S. state sales taxes</a> (sometimes called <em><a class="uri" href="tax-exclusive" title="wikilink">tax-exclusive</a></em>; this rate is not directly comparable with existing income and employment taxes).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> After the first year of implementation, this tax rate would be automatically adjusted annually using a formula specified in the legislation that reflects actual federal receipts in the previous fiscal year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="effective-tax-rate">Effective tax rate</h3>

<p>A household's <a href="effective_tax_rate" title="wikilink">effective tax rate</a> on consumption would vary with the annual expenditures on taxable items and the fixed monthly tax rebate. The rebate would have the greatest effect at low spending levels, where they could lower a household's effective rate to zero or below.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The lowest effective tax rate under the FairTax could be negative due to the rebate for households with annual spending amounts below <a href="Poverty_in_the_United_States#Measures_of_poverty" title="wikilink">poverty level spending</a> for a specified household size. At higher spending levels, the rebate has less impact, and a household's effective tax rate would approach 23% of total spending. A person spending at the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 0%, whereas someone spending at four times the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 17.2%.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Buying or otherwise receiving items and services not subject to federal taxation (such as a used home or car) can contribute towards a lower effective tax rate. The total amount of spending and the proportion of spending allocated to taxable items would determine a household's effective tax rate on consumption.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> If a rate is calculated on income, instead of the tax base, the percentage could exceed the statutory tax rate in a given year.</p>

<p>Under the FairTax, <a class="uri" href="family" title="wikilink">family</a> <a href="household" title="wikilink">households</a> of lawful U.S. residents would be eligible to receive a "Family Consumption Allowance" (FCA) based on family size (regardless of income) that is equal to the estimated total FairTax paid on <a class="uri" href="poverty" title="wikilink">poverty</a> level spending according to the <a href="Poverty_in_the_United_States#Measures_of_poverty" title="wikilink">poverty guidelines</a> published by the <a href="U.S._Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services" title="wikilink">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The FCA is a tax rebate (known as a "prebate" as it would be an advance) paid in twelve monthly installments, adjusted for <a class="uri" href="inflation" title="wikilink">inflation</a>.

<p>Opponents of the plan criticize this tax rebate due to its costs. Economists at the <a href="Beacon_Hill_Institute" title="wikilink">Beacon Hill Institute</a> estimated the overall rebate cost to be $489 billion (assuming 100% participation).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> In addition, economist <a href="Bruce_Bartlett" title="wikilink">Bruce Bartlett</a> has argued that the rebate would create a large opportunity for <a class="uri" href="fraud" title="wikilink">fraud</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> treats children disparately, and would constitute a <a href="Social_welfare_provision" title="wikilink">welfare</a> payment regardless of need.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="presentation-of-tax-rate">Presentation of tax rate</h3>

<p> Sales and income taxes behave differently due to differing definitions of tax base, which can make comparisons between the two confusing. Under the existing individual income plus employment (Social Security; Medicare; Medicaid) tax formula, taxes to be paid are included in the base on which the tax rate is imposed (known as <em><a class="uri" href="tax-inclusive" title="wikilink">tax-inclusive</a></em>). If an individual's gross income is $100 and the sum of their income plus employment tax rate is 23%, taxes owed equals $23. Traditional state sales taxes are imposed on a tax base equal to the pre-tax portion of a good's price (known as <em><a class="uri" href="tax-exclusive" title="wikilink">tax-exclusive</a></em>). A good priced at $77 with a 30% sales tax rate yields $23 in taxes owed. To adjust an inclusive rate to an exclusive rate, divide the given rate by one minus that rate (i.e.

<p>The FairTax <a href="statutory_rate" title="wikilink">statutory rate</a>, unlike most U.S. <a href="Sales_taxes_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">state-level sales taxes</a>, is presented on a tax base that includes the amount of FairTax paid. For example, a final after-tax price of $100 includes $23 of taxes. Although no such requirement is included in the text of the legislation, Congressman John Linder has stated that the FairTax would be implemented as an inclusive tax, which would include the tax in the retail price, not added on at checkout—an item on the shelf for five dollars would be five dollars total.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The legislation requires the receipt to display the tax as 23% of the total.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Linder states the FairTax is presented as a 23% tax rate for easy comparison to income and employment tax rates (the taxes it would be replacing). The plan's opponents call the <a class="uri" href="semantics" title="wikilink">semantics</a> deceptive. <a class="uri" href="FactCheck" title="wikilink">FactCheck</a> called the presentation misleading, saying that it hides the real truth of the tax rate.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> <a href="Bruce_Bartlett" title="wikilink">Bruce Bartlett</a> stated that polls show tax reform support is extremely sensitive to the proposed rate,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> and called the presentation confusing and deceptive based on the conventional method of calculating sales taxes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Proponents believe it is both inaccurate and misleading to say that an income tax is 23% and the FairTax is 30% as it implies that the sales tax burden is higher.</p>
<h3 id="revenue-neutrality">Revenue neutrality</h3>

<p>A key question surrounding the FairTax is whether the tax has the ability to be revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral.

<p>The FairTax would be tax free on mortgage interest up to the <a href="Federal_funds_rate" title="wikilink">federal borrowing rate</a> for like-term instruments as determined by the <a href="United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury" title="wikilink">Treasury</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn165" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> but since savings, education, and other investments would be tax free under the plan, the FairTax could decrease the incentive to spend more on homes.

<p>If the FairTax bill were passed, permanent elimination of income taxation would not be guaranteed; the FairTax bill would repeal much of the existing <a href="Internal_Revenue_Code" title="wikilink">tax code</a>, but the <a href="Sixteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Sixteenth Amendment</a> would remain in place. Preventing new legislation from reintroducing income taxation would require a repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment to the <a href="United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">United States Constitution</a> with a separate provision expressly prohibiting a federal income tax.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn175" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> This is referred to as an "aggressive repeal". Separate income taxes enforced by individual states would be unaffected by the federal repeal. Passing the FairTax would require only a simple majority in each house of the United States Congress along with the signature of the President, whereas enactment of a <a href="constitutional_amendment" title="wikilink">constitutional amendment</a> must be approved by two thirds of each house of the Congress, and three-quarters of the individual U.S. states. It is therefore possible that passage of the FairTax bill would simply add another taxation system. If a new income tax bill were passed after the FairTax passage, a hybrid system could develop; albeit, there is nothing preventing a bill for a hybrid system today. To address this issue and preclude that possibility, in the <a href="111th_Congress" title="wikilink">111th Congress</a> John Linder introduced a contingent <a href="sunset_provision" title="wikilink">sunset provision</a> in H.R. 25.

<p> Based on a study conducted by <a href="Dale_W._Jorgenson" title="wikilink">Dale Jorgenson</a>, proponents state that <a href="production_cost" title="wikilink">production cost</a> of domestic goods and services could decrease by approximately 22% on average after embedded tax costs are removed, leaving the sale nearly the same after taxes.

<p>One avenue for non-compliance is the black market. FairTax supporters state that the <a href="black_market" title="wikilink">black market</a> is largely untaxed under the current tax system. Economists estimate the <a href="underground_economy" title="wikilink">underground economy</a> in the United States to be between one and three trillion dollars annually.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn201" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn202" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> By imposing a sales tax, supporters argue that black market activity would be taxed when proceeds from such activity are spent on legal consumption.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn203" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> For example, the sale of illegal <a href="narcotic" title="wikilink">narcotics</a> would remain untaxed (instead of being guilty of income tax evasion, <a href="drug_dealer" title="wikilink">drug dealers</a> would be guilty of failing to submit sales tax), but they would face taxation when they used drug proceeds to buy consumer goods such as food, clothing, and cars. By taxing this previously untaxed money, FairTax supporters argue that non-filers would be paying part of their share of what would otherwise be uncollected income and payroll taxes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn204" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn205" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="tax-compliance-and-evasion">Tax compliance and evasion</h3>

<p> Proponents state the FairTax would reduce the number of tax filers by about 86% (from 100 million to 14 million) and reduce the filing complexity to a simplified state sales tax form.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn213" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> The <a href="Government_Accountability_Office" title="wikilink">Government Accountability Office</a> (GAO), among others, have specifically identified the negative relationship between compliance costs and the number of focal points for collection.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn214" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> Under the FairTax, the federal government would be able to concentrate tax enforcement efforts on a single tax. Retailers would receive an administrative fee equal to the greater of $200 or 0.25% of the remitted tax as compensation for compliance costs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn215" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> In addition, supporters state that the overwhelming majority of purchases occur in major retail outlets, which are very unlikely to evade the FairTax and risk losing their business licenses.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn216" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> Economic Census figures for 2002 show that 48.5% of merchandise sales are made by just 688 businesses (<a href="Big-box_store" title="wikilink">"Big-Box" retailers</a>). 85.7% of all retail sales are made by 92,334 businesses, which is 3.6% of American companies.

<p>The FairTax is a national tax, but can be administered by the states rather than a federal agency,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn218" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> which may have a bearing on compliance as the states' own agencies could monitor and audit businesses within that state. The 0.25% retained by the states amounts to $5 billion the states would have available for enforcement and administration. For example, <a class="uri" href="California" title="wikilink">California</a> should receive over $500 million for enforcement and administration, which is more than the $327 million budget for the state's sales and excise taxes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn219" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> Because the federal money paid to the states would be a percentage of the total revenue collected, John Linder claims the states would have an incentive to maximize collections.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn220" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> Proponents believe that states that choose to conform to the federal tax base would have advantages in enforcement, <a href="information_sharing" title="wikilink">information sharing</a>, and clear interstate revenue allocation rules.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn221" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn222" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> A study by the <a href="Beacon_Hill_Institute" title="wikilink">Beacon Hill Institute</a> concluded that, on average, states could more than halve their sales tax rates and that state economies would benefit greatly from adopting a state-level FairTax.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn223" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a></p>

<p>FairTax opponents state that compliance decreases when taxes are not <a href="Tax_withholding_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">automatically withheld</a> from citizens, and that massive <a href="tax_evasion" title="wikilink">tax evasion</a> could result by collecting at just one point in the economic system.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn224" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a> Compliance rates can also fall when taxed entities, rather than a third party, self-report their tax liability. For example, ordinary personal income taxes can be automatically withheld and are reported to the government by a third party. Taxes without withholding and with self-reporting, such as the FairTax, can see higher evasion rates. Economist Jane Gravelle of the <a href="Congressional_Research_Service" title="wikilink">Congressional Research Service</a> found studies showing that evasion rates of sales taxes are often above 10%, even when the sales tax rate is in the single digits.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn225" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> Tax publications by the <a href="Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development" title="wikilink">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> (OECD), IMF, and <a href="Brookings_Institution" title="wikilink">Brookings Institution</a> have suggested that the upper limit for a sales tax is about 10% before incentives for evasion become too great to control.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn226" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> According to the GAO, 80% of state tax officials opposed a national sales tax as an intrusion on their tax base.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn227" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> Opponents also raise concerns of legal <a href="tax_avoidance" title="wikilink">tax avoidance</a> by spending and consuming outside of the U.S. (imported goods would be subject to collection by the <a href="U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection" title="wikilink">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn228" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="underground-economy">Underground economy</h3>

<p>Opponents of the FairTax argue that imposing a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground and create a vast <a href="underground_economy" title="wikilink">underground economy</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn237" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods and services that are <a href="factors_of_production" title="wikilink">factors of production</a> are not taxed, since those goods would produce a final retail good that would be taxed. Individuals and businesses may be able to manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller's certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years. They are required to report these sales every month (see <a href="FairTax#Personal_versus_business_purchases" title="wikilink">Personal vs. business purchases</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn238" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> The government could also stipulate that all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt, regardless of transaction type (cash, credit, etc.), which would create a paper trail for evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in (the FairTax authorizes a reward for reporting tax cheats).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn239" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a></p>

<p>While many economists and tax experts support a consumption tax, problems could arise with using a retail sales tax rather than a <a href="value_added_tax" title="wikilink">value added tax</a> (VAT).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn240" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn241" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a> A VAT imposes a tax on the <a href="value_added" title="wikilink">value added</a> at every intermediate step of production, so the goods reach the final consumer with much of the tax already in the price.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn242" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a> The retail seller has little incentive to conceal retail sales, since he has already paid much of the good's tax.

This provides an incentive for retailers to conceal sales and engage in "<a href="arbitrage" title="wikilink">tax arbitrage</a>" by sharing some of the illicit tax savings with the final consumer. Citing evasion, <a href="Tim_Worstall" title="wikilink">Tim Worstall</a> wrote in <em>Forbes</em> that Europe’s 20-25% consumption taxes simply would not work if they were a sales tax: that’s why they’re all a VAT.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn243" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> <a href="Laurence_Kotlikoff" title="wikilink">Laurence Kotlikoff</a> has stated that the government could compel firms to report, via <a href="Tax_forms_in_the_United_States#1099_series" title="wikilink">1099-type forms</a>, their sales to other firms, which would provide the same records that arise under a VAT.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn244" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> In the United States, a general sales tax is imposed in 45 states plus the District of Columbia (accounting for over 97% of both population and economic output), which proponents argue provides a large infrastructure for taxing sales that many countries do not have.</p>

<p>Businesses would be required to submit monthly or quarterly reports (depending on sales volume) of taxable sales and sales tax collected on their monthly sales tax return.
