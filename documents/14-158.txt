Bollobás–Riordan polynomial

The Bollobás–Riordan polynomial can mean a 3-variable invariant polynomial of graphs on orientable surfaces, or a more general 4-variable invariant of ribbon graphs, generalizing the Tutte polynomial.
History
These polynomials were discovered by .
Formal definition
The 3-variable Bollobás–Riordan polynomial is given by



where

v(G) is the number of vertices of G;
e(G) is the number of its edges of G;
k(G) is the number of components of G;
r(G) is the rank of G such that r(G) = v(G) − k(G);
n(G) is the nullity of such that n(G) = e(G) − r(G);
bc(G) is the number of connected components of the boundary of G.
