   Bollobás–Riordan polynomial      Bollobás–Riordan polynomial   The Bollobás–Riordan polynomial can mean a 3- variable  invariant polynomial of graphs on orientable surfaces , or a more general 4-variable invariant of ribbon graphs, generalizing the Tutte polynomial .  History  These polynomials were discovered by .  Formal definition  The 3-variable Bollobás–Riordan polynomial is given by       R  G   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    =    ∑  F     x    r   (  G  )    -   r   (  F  )       y   n   (  F  )      z     k   (  F  )    -   b  c   (  F  )     +   n   (  F  )              R  G   x  y  z      subscript   F      superscript  x      r  G     r  F      superscript  y    n  F     superscript  z        k  F     b  c  F      n  F         RG(x,y,z)=\sum_{F}x^{r(G)-r(F)}y^{n(F)}z^{k(F)-bc(F)+n(F)}     where   v ( G ) is the number of vertices of G ;  e ( G ) is the number of its edges of G ;  k ( G ) is the number of components of G ;  r ( G ) is the rank of G such that r ( G ) = v ( G ) − k ( G );  n ( G ) is the nullity of such that n ( G ) = e ( G ) − r ( G );  bc ( G ) is the number of connected components of the boundary of G .
