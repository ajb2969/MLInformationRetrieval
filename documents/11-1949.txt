   Dickson polynomial      Dickson polynomial   In mathematics , the Dickson polynomials (or Brewer polynomials ), denoted D n ( x ,α), form a polynomial sequence introduced by  and rediscovered by  in his study of Brewer sums .  Over the complex numbers, Dickson polynomials are essentially equivalent to Chebyshev polynomials with a change of variable, and in fact Dickson polynomials are sometimes called Chebyshev polynomials. Dickson polynomials are mainly studied over finite fields, when they are not equivalent to Chebyshev polynomials. One of the main reasons for interest in them is that for fixed α, they give many examples of permutation polynomials : polynomials acting as permutations of finite fields.  Definition  D 0 ( x ,α) = 2, and for n > 0 Dickson polynomials (of the first kind) are given by         D  n    (  x  ,  α  )    =    ∑   p  =  0    ⌊   n  /  2   ⌋      n   n  -  p     (      n  -  p       p     )     (   -  α   )   p    x   n  -   2  p        .         subscript  D  n    x  α      superscript   subscript     p  0        n  2         n    n  p     binomial    n  p   p    superscript    α   p    superscript  x    n    2  p         D_{n}(x,\alpha)=\sum_{p=0}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}\frac{n}{n-p}{\left({{n-p}\atop%

The first few Dickson polynomials are        D  0    (  x  ,  α  )    =   2          subscript  D  0    x  α    2    D_{0}(x,\alpha)=2\,           D  1    (  x  ,  α  )    =   x          subscript  D  1    x  α    x    D_{1}(x,\alpha)=x\,           D  2    (  x  ,  α  )    =    x  2   -   2   α            subscript  D  2    x  α       superscript  x  2     2  α      D_{2}(x,\alpha)=x^{2}-2\alpha\,           D  3    (  x  ,  α  )    =    x  3   -   3  x   α            subscript  D  3    x  α       superscript  x  3     3  x  α      D_{3}(x,\alpha)=x^{3}-3x\alpha\,            D  4    (  x  ,  α  )    =     x  4   -   4   x  2   α    +   2   α  2      .         subscript  D  4    x  α         superscript  x  4     4   superscript  x  2   α      2   superscript  α  2       D_{4}(x,\alpha)=x^{4}-4x^{2}\alpha+2\alpha^{2}.\,     The Dickson polynomials of the second kind E n are defined by         E  n    (  x  ,  α  )    =    ∑   p  =  0    ⌊   n  /  2   ⌋      (      n  -  p       p     )     (   -  α   )   p    x   n  -   2  p        .         subscript  E  n    x  α      superscript   subscript     p  0        n  2        binomial    n  p   p    superscript    α   p    superscript  x    n    2  p         E_{n}(x,\alpha)=\sum_{p=0}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}{\left({{n-p}\atop{p}}\right)}(%

The Dickson polynomials with parameter α = 1 or α = -1 are related to the Fibonacci and Lucas polynomials .  The Dickson polynomials with parameter α = 0 give monomials:          D  n    (  x  ,  0  )    =    x  n     .         subscript  D  n    x  0     superscript  x  n     D_{n}(x,0)=x^{n}\,.     Permutation polynomials and Dickson polynomials  A permutation polynomial (for a given finite field) is one that acts as a permutation of the elements of the finite field.  The Dickson polynomial D n ( x ,α) (considered as a function of x with α fixed) is a permutation polynomial for the field with q elements if and only if n is coprime to q 2 −1. 1  M.  proved that any integral polynomial that is a permutation polynomial for infinitely many prime fields is a composition of Dickson polynomials and linear polynomials (with rational coefficients). This assertion has become known as Schur's conjecture, although in fact Schur did not make this conjecture. Since Fried's paper contained numerous errors, a corrected account was given by G. , and subsequently P.  gave a simpler proof along the lines of an argument due to Schur.  Further, P.  proved that any permutation polynomial over the finite field F q whose degree is simultaneously coprime to q −1 and less than q 1/4 must be a composition of Dickson polynomials and linear polynomials.
