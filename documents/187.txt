   Signal-to-quantization-noise ratio      Signal-to-quantization-noise ratio   Signal-to-Quantization-Noise Ratio ( SQNR or SN q R ) is widely used quality measure in analysing digitizing schemes such as PCM ( pulse code modulation ) and multimedia codecs . The SQNR reflects the relationship between the maximum nominal signal strength and the quantization error (also known as quantization noise) introduced in the analog-to-digital conversion .  The SQNR formula is derived from the general SNR ( Signal-to-Noise Ratio ) formula for the binary pulse-code modulated  communication channel :      SNR  =     3  ×   2   2  n      1  +    4   P  e    ×   (    2   2  n    -  1   )         m  m     (  t  )   2      m  p     (  t  )   2          SNR        3   superscript  2    2  n       1      4   subscript  P  e       superscript  2    2  n    1           subscript  m  m    superscript  t  2       subscript  m  p    superscript  t  2        \mathrm{SNR}=\frac{3\times 2^{2n}}{1+4P_{e}\times(2^{2n}-1)}\frac{m_{m}(t)^{2}%
 }{m_{p}(t)^{2}}     where      P  e     subscript  P  e    P_{e}   is the probability of received bit error       m  p    (  t  )        subscript  m  p   t    m_{p}(t)   is the peak message signal level       m  m    (  t  )        subscript  m  m   t    m_{m}(t)   is the mean message signal level  As SQNR applies to quantized signals, the formulae for SQNR refer to discrete-time digital signals. Instead of    m   (  t  )       m  t    m(t)   , we will use the digitized signal    x   (  n  )       x  n    x(n)   . For   N   N   N   quantization steps, each sample,   x   x   x   requires    ν  =    log  2   N       ν    subscript   2   N     \nu=\log_{2}N   bits. The probability distribution function (pdf) representing the distribution of values in   x   x   x   and can be denoted as    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   . The maximum magnitude value of any   x   x   x   is denoted by    x   m  a  x      subscript  x    m  a  x     x_{max}   .  As SQNR, like SNR, is a ratio of signal power to some noise power, it can be calculated as:      SQNR  =    P   s  i  g  n  a  l     P   n  o  i  s  e     =    E   [   x  2   ]     E   [    x  ~   2   ]           SQNR     subscript  P    s  i  g  n  a  l     subscript  P    n  o  i  s  e              E   delimited-[]   superscript  x  2       E   delimited-[]   superscript   normal-~  x   2         \mathrm{SQNR}=\frac{P_{signal}}{P_{noise}}=\frac{E[x^{2}]}{E[\tilde{x}^{2}]}   The signal power is:        x  2   ¯   =   E   [   x  2   ]    =   P   x  ν    =   ∫    x  2   f   (  x  )   d  x           normal-¯   superscript  x  2      E   delimited-[]   superscript  x  2           subscript  P   superscript  x  ν              superscript  x  2   f  x  d  x       \overline{x^{2}}=E[x^{2}]=P_{x^{\nu}}=\int x^{2}f(x)dx   The quantization noise power can be expressed as:       E   [    x  ~   2   ]    =    x   m  a  x   2    3  ×   4  ν           E   delimited-[]   superscript   normal-~  x   2        superscript   subscript  x    m  a  x    2     3   superscript  4  ν       E[\tilde{x}^{2}]=\frac{x_{max}^{2}}{3\times 4^{\nu}}   Giving:      SQNR  =    3  ×   4  ν   ×    x  2   ¯     x   m  a  x   2        SQNR      3   superscript  4  ν    normal-¯   superscript  x  2      superscript   subscript  x    m  a  x    2      \mathrm{SQNR}=\frac{3\times 4^{\nu}\times\overline{x^{2}}}{x_{max}^{2}}     When the SQNR is desired in terms of Decibels (dB) , a useful approximation to SQNR is:        SQNR  |    d  B    =    P   x  ν    +   6  ν   +  4.8        evaluated-at  SQNR    d  B       subscript  P   superscript  x  ν      6  ν   4.8     \mathrm{SQNR}|_{dB}=P_{x^{\nu}}+6\nu+4.8   where   ν   ν   \nu   is the number of bits in a quantized sample, and    P   x  ν      subscript  P   superscript  x  ν     P_{x^{\nu}}   is the signal power calculated above. Note that for each bit added to a sample, the SQNR goes up by approximately 6dB (     20  ×  l   o   g  10    (  2  )         20  l   o   subscript  g  10   2    20\times log_{10}(2)   ).
