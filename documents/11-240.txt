Pyrazolylalanine synthase

In enzymology, a pyrazolylalanine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-serine + pyrazole 
 
 
 
  3-(pyrazol-1-yl)-L-alanine + H2O
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-serine and pyrazole, whereas its two products are 3-(pyrazol-1-yl)-L-alanine and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-serine hydro-lyase [adding pyrazole 3-(pyrazol-1-yl)-L-alanine-forming]. Other names in common use include beta-pyrazolylalaninase, beta-(1-pyrazolyl)alanine synthase, and L-serine hydro-lyase (adding pyrazole). It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
