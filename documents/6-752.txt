   Epsilon-induction      Epsilon-induction   In mathematics ,    ∈     \in   -induction ( epsilon-induction ) is a variant of transfinite induction that can be used in set theory to prove that all sets satisfy a given property P [ x ]. If the truth of the property for x follows from its truth for all elements of x , for every set x , then the property is true of all sets. In symbols:       ∀  x   (  ∀  y   (  y  ∈  x  →  P   [  y  ]   )   →  P   [  x  ]   )   →  ∀   x   P   [  x  ]      fragments  for-all  x   fragments  normal-(  for-all  y   fragments  normal-(  y   x  normal-→  P   fragments  normal-[  y  normal-]   normal-)   normal-→  P   fragments  normal-[  x  normal-]   normal-)   normal-→  for-all  x  P   fragments  normal-[  x  normal-]     \forall x\Big(\forall y(y\in x\rightarrow P[y])\rightarrow P[x]\Big)%
 \rightarrow\forall x\,P[x]       This principle, sometimes called the axiom of induction (in set theory), is equivalent to the axiom of regularity given the other ZF axioms.   ∈     \in   -induction is a special case of well-founded induction .  The name is most often pronounced "epsilon-induction", because the set membership symbol   ∈     \in   historically developed from the Greek letter   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   .
