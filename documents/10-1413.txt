Protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase

In enzymology, a protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3,4-dihydroxybenzoate + O2

 
  3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (protocatechuic acid) and O2, whereas its product is 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on single donors with O2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is protocatechuate:oxygen 3,4-oxidoreductase (decyclizing). Other names in common use include protocatechuate oxygenase, protocatechuic acid oxidase, protocatechuic 3,4-dioxygenase, and protocatechuic 3,4-oxygenase. This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation and 2,4-dichlorobenzoate degradation. It employs one cofactor, iron.
This enzyme has been found effective at improving organic fluorophore-stability in single-molecule experiments.1
