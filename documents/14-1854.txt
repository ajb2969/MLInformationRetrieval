   Schottky's theorem      Schottky's theorem   In mathematical complex analysis , Schottky's theorem , introduced by  is a quantitative version of Picard's theorem which states that the size | f ( z )| of a holomorphic function f in the open unit disk that does not take the values 0 or 1 can be bounded in terms of z and f (0).  Schottky's original theorem did not give an explicit bound for f .  gave some weak explicit bounds.  gave a strong explicit bound, showing that if f is holomorphic in the open unit disk and does not take the values 0 or 1 then       log   |   f   (  z  )    |    ≤     1  +   |  z  |     1  -   |  z  |      (   7  +   max   (  0  ,   log   |   f   (  0  )    |    )     )              f  z           1    z      1    z       7    0        f  0          \log|f(z)|\leq\frac{1+|z|}{1-|z|}(7+\max(0,\log|f(0)|))   . Several authors, such as , have given variations of Ahlfors's bound with better constants: in particular  gave some bounds whose constants are in some sense the best possible.
