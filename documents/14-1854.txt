Schottky's theorem

In mathematical complex analysis, Schottky's theorem, introduced by  is a quantitative version of Picard's theorem which states that the size |f(z)| of a holomorphic function f in the open unit disk that does not take the values 0 or 1 can be bounded in terms of z and f(0).
Schottky's original theorem did not give an explicit bound for f.  gave some weak explicit bounds.  gave a strong explicit bound, showing that if f is holomorphic in the open unit disk and does not take the values 0 or 1 then


 
 . Several authors, such as , have given variations of Ahlfors's bound with better constants: in particular  gave some bounds whose constants are in some sense the best possible.
