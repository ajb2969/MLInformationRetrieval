   John Clive Ward      John Clive Ward   John Clive Ward (1 August 1924 – 6 May 2000) was a British-Australian physicist . His most famous creation was the Ward–Takahashi identity , originally known as "Ward Identity" (or "Ward Identities"). 1 2 This celebrated result, in quantum electrodynamics , was inspired by a conjecture of Dyson 3 and was disclosed in a one-half-page letter typical of Ward's succinct style. In their recent book entitled Quantum Electrodynamics , Greiner and Reinhardt state in their discussion of charge renormalisation : "Yet the Ward Identity has a much more fundamental significance: it ensures the universality of the electromagnetic interaction ." 4  In his book The Infinity Puzzle , Frank Close devotes a whole chapter to this Ward creation and entitles it The Identity of John Ward , in which he writes: "Ward Identities lie at the very foundations of renormalization." 5  Andrei Sakharov classified Ward as one of the " titans " of quantum electrodynamics alongside Dyson , Feynman , Schwinger , and Tomonaga . 6 In this regard, it has been said that physicists have made use of his principles and developments " often without knowing it, and generally without quoting him. " 7  Additional contributions  Ward's probability amplitude for quantum entanglement  In a 1947 paper, published in Nature 8 (with Maurice Pryce ), Ward was the first to calculate, and use, the probability amplitudes for the polarisation of two entangled photons moving in opposite directions. 9 For polarisations x and y , Ward derived this probability amplitude to be 10      |  ψ  =   (  |  x  ,  y  -  |  y  ,  x  )      fragments  normal-|  ψ    fragments  normal-(  normal-|  x  normal-,  y   normal-|  y  normal-,  x  normal-)     \left|\psi\right\rang=(\left|x,y\right\rang-\left|y,x\right\rang)     which once normalised can be expressed as 11 12      |  ψ  =   1   2     (  |   x  1   |   y  2   -  |   y  1   |   x  2   )      fragments  normal-|  ψ     1    2     fragments  normal-(  normal-|   subscript  x  1   normal-|   subscript  y  2    normal-|   subscript  y  1   normal-|   subscript  x  2   normal-)     \left|\psi\right\rang={1\over\sqrt{2}}(\left|x\right\rang_{1}\left|y\right%
 \rang_{2}-\left|y\right\rang_{1}\left|x\right\rang_{2})     where 1 and 2 refer to the two quanta propagating in different directions. Ward's probability amplitude is then applied to derive the correlation of the quantum polarisations of the two photons propagating in opposite directions. 13 This prediction was experimentally confirmed by Wu and Shaknov in 1950. 14 In current terminology this result corresponds to a pair of entangled photons and is directly relevant to a typical Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox , or situation, as explained by Dalitz and Duarte . 15 16 17  It should be noted that, apparently following Dirac's doctrine, Ward was never bothered by issues of interpretation in quantum mechanics . 18  Quantum statistics, Fermion theory, the Ising Model, Feynman diagrams, and Aldermaston  In addition, he made important contributions to quantum mechanics , 19 20 fermion theory, 21 quantum solid-state physics , 22 and statistical mechanics and the Ising model . 23 24 25 His joint work, with Kac, on the Ising Model 26 gave rise to what is now being called the Kac-Ward operator. 27 He is further credited with being an early pioneer in the use of Feynman diagrams . 28  In 1955–1956 Ward worked, at Aldermaston, on British atomic weapons and has been portrayed as the "creator of the British hydrogen bomb ". 29 This topic is discussed by historian Lorna Arnold 30 while Ward's own account is given in his memoirs. 31 An additional analysis on this issue is provided by one of Ward's colleagues, and friend, Richard Dalitz , who wrote: "Ward had independently conceived a two-stage device". 32  Standard Model  Ward is also one of the authors of the Standard Model of gauge particle interactions: his contributions were published in a series of papers he co-authored with Abdus Salam . 33 34 35 36 An insightful and well documented discussion on Ward's contribution to the physics of the Standard Model is given by Gordon Fraser in the book Cosmic Anger . 37 This topic is discussed further by Frank Close , who provides an illuminating perspective on the importance of Ward's contribution to the Standard Model. 38  Frank Duarte writes about a series of conversations with Richard Dalitz who conveyed that, following his own careful scrutiny, Ward's contribution to the Standard Model was "more extensive than accepted by popular belief." 39 Duarte adds that albeit Ward initially expressed "annoyance" at his exclusion from the 1979 Nobel, he later "projected a fairly serene attitude towards this topic and even joked about the existence of more lucrative prizes." 40 Ward's own account is provided in his memoirs, in his usual laconic style. 41  The contributions of Salam and Ward to the Standard Model were crucial to the development of the theoretical structure of the Higgs boson , as described by Higgs himself. 42  Macquarie University  After World War II , Ward worked in several places in the United States and eventually he moved to Sydney, via New Zealand . 43 In 1964 he created the physics program of Macquarie University using the Feynman Lectures on Physics as primary textbooks. This program had a strong experimental emphasis and Ward himself (who originally was trained as an engineer) "had great admiration for anything practical". 44 Also, Ward regarded physics as a vocation rather than a profession. 45  In the late 1970s Ward participated, with Frank Duarte , in the successful Macquarie science reform movement . 46 47 and considered this a "most important accomplishment". 48  Personal  Ward's total number of published papers was only about 20, a fact that reflects a strong sense of self-criticism. He was also critical of what he called "PhD factories" and expressed scepticism towards the importance being attached to large number of citations. Ward's "directness and frankness often got him at odds with managers and administrators." 49  Besides his physics, Ward was an accomplished pianist and French horn player. Although a bachelor most of his life, he was briefly married while in the US. In Sydney, he lived at 10 Fern Street, in the northern suburb of Pymble . 50 He has an Erdős number of 2.  After death  In immediate correspondence following his death, Willis E. Lamb wrote "I greatly admired him and his work... I hope our paths cross again." Philip Anderson highlighted Ward's contribution to the Standard Model while indicating that he had communicated his passing to Freeman Dyson . 51 Ward's succinct unfinished memoirs were published in 2004. 52  Ward's friends and co-authors  (Figure)  200 px|right| Luttinger's theorem (introduced by J.
