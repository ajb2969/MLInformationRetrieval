Wiener's attack

The Wiener's attack, named after cryptologist Michael J. Wiener, is a type of cryptographic attack against RSA. The attack uses the continued fraction method to expose the private key d when d is small.
Background on RSA
Before we discuss how Wiener's attack works, we will first briefly explain how RSA works. For more details see the main entry on the RSA cryptosystem.
 Let Alice and Bob be two people who want to communicate securely. More specifically, Alice wants to send a message to Bob which only Bob can read. First Bob chooses two primes p and q. Then he calculates the RSA modulus N = pq. This RSA modulus is made public together with the encryption exponent e. N and e form the public key pair (e,N). By making this information public, anyone can encrypt messages to Bob. The decryption exponent d satisfies 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , is Euler’s phi function (note: this is the order of the multiplicative group

 
 ). The encryption exponent e and 
 
 
 
  also must be relatively prime so that there is a modular inverse. The factorization of N and the private key d are kept secret, so that only Bob can decrypt the message. We denote the private key pair as (d, N). The encryption of the message M is given by 
 
 
 
  and the decryption of cipher text 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
  (using Fermat's little theorem).
Using the Euclidean algorithm, one can efficiently recover the secret key d if one knows the factorization of N. By having the secret key d, one can efficiently factor the modulus of N.1
Small Private Key
In the RSA Cryptosystem, Bob might tend to use a small value of d, rather than a large random number to improve the RSA decryption performance. However, Wiener’s attack shows that choosing a small value for d will result in an insecure system in which an attacker can recover all secret information, i.e., break the RSA system. This break is based on Wiener’s Theorem, which holds for small values of d. Wiener has proved that the attacker may efficiently find d when

Wiener's paper also presented some countermeasures against his attack that allow fast decryption. Two techniques are described as follows.
Choosing large public key: Replace 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  for some large of 
 
 
 
 . When 
 
 
 
  is large enough, i.e. 
 
 
 
 , then Wiener’s attack can not be applied regardless of how small 
 
 
 
  is.
Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem: Suppose one chooses d such that both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are small but 
 
 
 
  itself is not, then a fast decryption of 
 
 
 
  can be done as follows:
1. First compute 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
 2. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to compute the unique value of 
 
 
 
  which satisfies 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The result of 
 
 
 
  satisfies 
 
 
 
  as needed. The point is that Wiener’s attack does not apply here because the value of 
 
 
 
  can be large. 3 
How Wiener's attack works
Since


 
 ,
there exists an integer K such that



Define 
 
 
 
  to be substituted in the equation above which gives:



Defining 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and substituting into the above gives:


 
 . Divided by 
 
 
 
 :

 
 , where 
 
 
 
 .
So, 
 
 
 
  is slightly smaller than 
 
 
 
 , and the former is composed entirely of public information. However, a method of checking a guess is still required. Assuming that 
 
 
 
  (a reasonable assumption unless 
 
 
 
  is large) the last equation above may be written as:

 
  By using simple algebraic manipulations and identities, a guess can be checked for accuracy. 4
Wiener's theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
 .
 Given 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , the attacker can efficiently recover 
 
 
 
 .5
Example
Suppose that the public keys are 
 
 

 The attack shall determine 
 
 
 
 .
 By using Wiener's Theorem and continued fractions to approximate

 
 , first we try to find the continued fractions expansion of 
 
 
 
 . Note that this algorithm finds fractions in their lowest terms. We know that



According to the continued fractions expansion of 
 
 
 
 , all convergents 
 
 
 
  are:



We can verify that the first convergent does not produce a factorization of 
 
 
 
 . However, the convergent 
 
 
 
  yields


 
  Now, if we solve the equation









then we find the roots which are 
 
 
 
 . Therefore we have found the factorization


 
 . Notice that, for the modulus 
 
 
 
 , Wiener's Theorem will work if

 
 .
Proof of Wiener's theorem
The proof is based on approximations using continued fractions.67
 Since 
 
 
 
 , there exists a 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . Therefore


 
 .
Hence, 
 
 
 
  is an approximation of 
 
 
 
 . Although the attacker does not know 
 
 
 
 , he may use 
 
 
 
  to approximate it. Indeed, since


 
  and 
 
 
 
 , we have:






Using 
 
 
 
  in place of 
 
 
 
  we obtain:

















Now, 
 
 
 
 , so 
 
 







Since 
 
 
 
 . Hence we obtain:

(1) $\left \vert \frac{e}{N}- \frac{k}{d} \right \vert \le \frac{1}{dN^{ \frac{1}{4}}}$


Since $d< \frac{1}{3}N^{ \frac{1}{4}},2d<3d,$ then $2d<3d, we obtain: 
 
 : From (1) and (2), we can conclude that
$$\left \vert \frac{e}{N}- \frac{k}{d} \right \vert \le \frac{3k}{d \sqrt{N}}< \frac{1}{d \cdot 2d}= \frac{1}{2d^2} \blacksquare$$
