Mercator series

In mathematics, the Mercator series or Newton–Mercator series is the Taylor series for the natural logarithm:



In summation notation,



The series converges to the natural logarithm (shifted by 1) whenever −1 th derivative of ln x at x = 1, starting with



Alternatively, one can start with the finite geometric series (t ≠ −1)



which gives



It follows that



and by termwise integration,



If −1 n \to \infty.
This expression may be integrated iteratively k more times to yield


 
  where


 
  and


 
  are polynomials in x.1
Special cases
Setting x = 1 in the Mercator series yields the alternating harmonic series



Complex series
The complex power series



is the Taylor series for -log(1 - z), where log denotes the principal branch of the complex logarithm. This series converges precisely for all complex number |z| ≤ 1, z ≠ 1. In fact, as seen by the ratio test, it has radius of convergence equal to 1, therefore converges absolutely on every disk B(0, r) with radius r \scriptstyle \overline{B(0,1)}\setminus B(1,\delta), with δ > 0. This follows at once from the algebraic identity:


 
  observing that the right-hand side is uniformly convergent on the whole closed unit disk.
