   Glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase      Glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase   In enzymology , a glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dTTP + alpha- D -glucose 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + dTDP-glucose    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dTTP and alpha- D -glucose 1-phosphate, whereas its two products are pyrophosphate and dTDP-glucose . 1  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , to be specific, those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : nucleotide sugars metabolism , streptomycin biosynthesis, and polyketide sugar unit biosynthesis. 2 3  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is dTTP:alpha- D -glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase . Other names in common use include:   glucose 1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase,  dTDP-glucose synthase''', '''dTDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase,  thymidine diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase,  thymidine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase, and  TDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase.
