Finite extensions of local fields

In algebraic number theory, through completion, the study of ramification of a prime ideal can often be reduced to the case of local fields where a more detailed analysis can be carried out with the aid of tools such as ramification groups.
In this article, a local field is non-archimedean and has finite residue field.
Unramified extension
Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite Galois extension of nonarchimedean local fields with finite residue fields 
 
 
 
  and Galois group 
 
 
 
 . Then the following are equivalent.

(i) 
 
 
 
  is unramified.
(ii) 
 
 
 
  is a field, where 
 
 
 
  is the maximal ideal of 
 
 
 
 .
(iii) 
 
 

(iv) The inertia subgroup of 
 
 
 
  is trivial.
(v) If 
 
 
 
  is a uniformizing element of 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is also a uniformizing element of 
 
 
 
 .

When 
 
 
 
  is unramified, by (iv) (or (iii)), G can be identified with 
 
 
 
 , which is finite cyclic.
The above implies that there is an equivalence of categories between the finite unramified extensions of a local field K and finite separable extensions of the residue field of K.
Totally ramified extension
Again, let 
 
 
 
  be a finite Galois extension of nonarchimedean local fields with finite residue fields 
 
 
 
  and Galois group 
 
 
 
 . The following are equivalent.



 
  is totally ramified


 
  coincides with its inertia subgroup.


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a root of an Eisenstein polynomial.
The norm 
 
 
 
  contains a uniformizer of 
 
 
 
 .
