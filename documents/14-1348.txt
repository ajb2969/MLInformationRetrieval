   Finite extensions of local fields      Finite extensions of local fields   In algebraic number theory , through completion, the study of ramification of a prime ideal can often be reduced to the case of local fields where a more detailed analysis can be carried out with the aid of tools such as ramification groups .  In this article, a local field is non-archimedean and has finite residue field .  Unramified extension  Let    L  /  K      L  K    L/K   be a finite Galois extension of nonarchimedean local fields with finite residue fields    l  /  k      l  k    l/k   and Galois group   G   G   G   . Then the following are equivalent.   (i)    L  /  K      L  K    L/K   is unramified .  (ii)      𝒪  L   /   𝒪  L    𝔭         subscript  𝒪  L    subscript  𝒪  L    𝔭    \mathcal{O}_{L}/\mathcal{O}_{L}\mathfrak{p}   is a field, where   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   is the maximal ideal of    𝒪  K     subscript  𝒪  K    \mathcal{O}_{K}   .  (iii)     [  L  :  K  ]   =   [  l  :  k  ]      fragments   fragments  normal-[  L  normal-:  K  normal-]     fragments  normal-[  l  normal-:  k  normal-]     [L:K]=[l:k]     (iv) The inertia subgroup of   G   G   G   is trivial.  (v) If   π   π   \pi   is a uniformizing element of   K   K   K   , then   π   π   \pi   is also a uniformizing element of   L   L   L   .   When    L  /  K      L  K    L/K   is unramified, by (iv) (or (iii)), G can be identified with    Gal   (   l  /  k   )      Gal    l  k     \operatorname{Gal}(l/k)   , which is finite cyclic .  The above implies that there is an equivalence of categories between the finite unramified extensions of a local field K and finite separable extensions of the residue field of K .  Totally ramified extension  Again, let    L  /  K      L  K    L/K   be a finite Galois extension of nonarchimedean local fields with finite residue fields    l  /  k      l  k    l/k   and Galois group   G   G   G   . The following are equivalent.       L  /  K      L  K    L/K   is totally ramified     G   G   G   coincides with its inertia subgroup.      L  =   K   [  π  ]        L    K   delimited-[]  π      L=K[\pi]   where   π   π   \pi   is a root of an Eisenstein polynomial .  The norm    N   (   L  /  K   )       N    L  K     N(L/K)   contains a uniformizer of   K   K   K   .   See also   Abhyankar's lemma   References      "  Category:Algebraic number theory
