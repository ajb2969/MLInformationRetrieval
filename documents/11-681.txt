Arylalkyl acylamidase

In enzymology, an arylalkyl acylamidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-acetylarylalkylamine + H2O 
 
 
 
  arylalkylamine + acetate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-acetylarylalkylamine and H2O, whereas its two products are arylalkylamine and acetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-acetylarylalkylamine amidohydrolase. This enzyme is also called aralkyl acylamidase.
