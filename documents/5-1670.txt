   Astronomical constant      Astronomical constant   An astronomical constant is a physical constant used in astronomy . Formal sets of constants, along with recommended values, have been defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) several times: in 1964 1 and in 1976 2 (with an update in 1994 3 ). In 2009 the IAU adopted a new current set, and recognizing that new observations and techniques continuously provide better values for these constants, they decided 4 to not fix these values, but have the Working Group on Numerical Standards continuously maintain a set of Current Best Estimates 5 . The set of constants is widely reproduced in publications such as the Astronomical Almanac of the United States Naval Observatory and Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office .  Besides the IAU list of units and constants, also the International Earth Rotation Service defines constants relevant to the orientation and rotation of the Earth, in its technical notes . 6  The IAU system of constants defines a system of astronomical units for length, mass and time (in fact, several such systems), and also includes constants such as the speed of light and the constant of gravitation which allow transformations between astronomical units and SI units . Slightly different values for the constants are obtained depending on the frame of reference used. Values quoted in barycentric dynamical time (TDB) or equivalent time scales such as the T eph of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory  ephemerides represent the mean values that would be measured by an observer on the Earth's surface (strictly, on the surface of the geoid ) over a long period of time. The IAU also recommends values in SI units, which are the values which would be measured (in proper length and proper time ) by an observer at the barycentre of the Solar System: these are obtained by the following transformations: 7        τ  A    (  SI  )    =     (   1  +   L  B    )    1  3     τ  A    (  TDB  )           subscript  τ  A   SI      superscript    1   subscript  L  normal-B      1  3     subscript  τ  A   TDB     \tau_{A}({\rm SI})=(1+L_{\rm B})^{\frac{1}{3}}\tau_{A}({\rm TDB})\,          G  E   (  SI  )    =    (   1  +   L  B    )   G  E   (  TDB  )          G  E  SI       1   subscript  L  normal-B    G  E  TDB     GE({\rm SI})=(1+L_{\rm B})GE({\rm TDB})\,          G  S   (  SI  )    =    (   1  +   L  B    )   G  S   (  TDB  )          G  S  SI       1   subscript  L  normal-B    G  S  TDB     GS({\rm SI})=(1+L_{\rm B})GS({\rm TDB})\,     Astronomical system of units  The astronomical unit of time is a time interval of one day ( D ) of 86400 seconds. The astronomical unit of mass is the mass of the Sun ( S ). The astronomical unit of length is that length ( A ) for which the Gaussian gravitational constant ( k ) takes the value  when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and time. 8  Table of astronomical constants      Quantity   Symbol   Value   Relative uncertainty   Ref.

The values here are appropriate for the older theories, but additional constants are required for current models.  † The definitions of these derived constants have been taken from the references cited, but the values have been recalculated to take account of the more precise values of the primary constants cited in the table.
