   Group of rational points on the unit circle      Group of rational points on the unit circle  In mathematics, the '''[[rational point]]s on the [[unit circle]]''' are those points (''x'', ''y'') such that both ''x'' and ''y'' are [[rational number]]s ("fractions") and satisfy ''x'' 2 + ''y'' 2 = 1. The set of such points turns out to be closely related to primitive [[Pythagorean triple]]s.  Cons ider a primitive right triangle , that is, with integral side lengths a , b , c , with c the hypotenuse, such that the sides have no common factor larger than 1. Then on the unit circle there exists the rational point ( a / c , b / c ), which, in the complex plane , is just a / c + ib / c , where i is the imaginary unit . Conversely, if ( x , y ) is a rational point on the unit circle in the 1st quadrant of the coordinate system (i.e. x > 0, y > 0), then there exists a primitive right triangle with sides xc , yc , c , with c being the least common multiple of x and y denominators. There is a correspondence between points ( x , y ) in the x - y plane and points x + iy in the complex plane which will be used below, with ( a , b ) taken as equal to a + ib .  Group operation  The set of rational points forms an infinite abelian group under rotations, which shall be called G in this article. The identity element is the point (1, 0) = 1 + i 0 = 1. The group operation, or "product" is ( x , y ) * ( t , u ) = ( xt − uy , xu + yt ). This product is angle addition since x = cosine ( A ) and y = sine ( A ), where A is the angle the radius vector ( x , y ) makes with the radius vector (1,0), measured counter clockwise. So with ( x , y ) and ( t , u ) forming angles A and B , respectively, with (1, 0), their product ( xt − uy , xu + yt ) is just the rational point on the unit circle with angle A + B . But we can do these group operations in a way that may be easier, with complex numbers: Write the point ( x , y ) as x + iy and write ( t , u ) as t + iu . Then the product above is just the ordinary multiplication ( x + iy )( t + iu ) = xt − yu + i ( xu + yt ), which corresponds to the ( xt − uy , xu + yt ) above.  Example  The points on the unit circle: 3/5 + i 4/5 and 5/13 + i 12/13 (corresponding to the two most famous Pythagorean right triangles:3,4,5 and 5,12,13) are elements of G , and their group product is (−33/65 + i56/65), which corresponds to a 33,56,65 Pythagorean right triangle. The sum of the squares of the numerators 33 and 56 is 1089 + 3136 = 4225, which is the square of the denominator 65.  Other ways to describe the group         G  ≅   SO   (  2  ,  ℚ  )     .      G    SO   2  ℚ      G\cong\mathrm{SO}(2,\mathbb{Q}).        The set of all 2×2 rotation matrices with rational entries coincides with G.This follows from the fact that the circle group     S  1     superscript  S  1    S^{1}   is isomorphic to    SO   (  2  ,  ℝ  )       SO   2  ℝ     \mathrm{SO}(2,\mathbb{R})   , and the fact that their rational points coincide.  Group structure  The structure of G is an infinite sum of cyclic groups . Let G 2 denote the subgroup of G generated by the point . G 2 is a cyclic subgroup of order 4. For a prime p of form 4 k + 1, let G p denote the subgroup of elements with denominator p n , n a nonnegative integer. G p is an infinite cyclic group. The point ( a 2 − b 2 )/ p + (2 ab / p ) i is a generator of G p . Furthermore, by factoring the denominators of an element of G , it can be shown that G is a direct sum of G 2 and the G p . That is:         G  ≅    G  2   ⊕    ⊕   p  ≡   1  mod  4      G  p      .      G   direct-sum   subscript  G  2     subscript  direct-sum    p   modulo  1  4      subscript  G  p       G\cong G_{2}\oplus\bigoplus_{p\equiv 1\bmod 4}G_{p}.        Since it is a direct sum rather than direct product , only finitely many of the values in the Gp s differ from zero.  Example  Suppose we take the element in G corresponding to ({ 0 };2,0,1,0,0,...0,...) where the first coordinate 0 is in C 4 and the other coordinates give the powers of ( a 2 − b 2 )/ p ( r ) + i 2 ab / p ( r ) where p ( r ) is the rth prime of form 4 k + 1. Then this corresponds to, in G , the rational point (3/5 + i 4/5) 2 · (8/17 + i 15/17) 1 = −416/425 + i87/425). The denominator 425 is the product of the denominator 5 twice, and the denominator 17 once, and as in the previous example, the square of the numerator −416 plus the square of the numerator 87 is equal to the square of the denominator 425. It should also be noted, as a connection to help retain understanding, that the denominator 5 = p (1) is the 1st prime of form 4 k + 1, and the denominator 17 = p (3) is the 3rd prime of form 4 k + 1.  The unit hyperbola's group of rational points  There is a close connection between this group on the unit hyperbola and the group discussed above. If     a  +   i  b    c        a    i  b    c    \frac{a+ib}{c}   is a rational point on the unit circle, where a / c and b / c are reduced fractions , then ( c / a , b / a ) is a rational point on the unit hyperbola, since        (   c  /  a   )   2   -    (   b  /  a   )   2    =  1   ,         superscript    c  a   2    superscript    b  a   2    1    (c/a)^{2}-(b/a)^{2}=1,   satisfying the equation for the unit hyperbola. The group operation here is       (  x  ,  y  )   ×   (  u  ,  v  )    =   (    x  u   +   y  v    ,    x  v   +   y  u    )    ,         x  y    u  v         x  u     y  v        x  v     y  u       (x,y)\times(u,v)=(xu+yv,xv+yu),   and the group identity is the same point (1,0) as above. In this group there is a close connection with hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine , which parallels the connection with cosine and sine in the unit circle group above.  Copies inside a larger group   There are isomorphic copies of both groups, as subgroups,(and as geometric objects) of the group of the rational points on the abelian variety in four-dimensional space given by        w  2   +   x  2    -   y  2    +   z  2    =  0.             superscript  w  2    superscript  x  2     superscript  y  2     superscript  z  2    0.    w^{2}+x^{2}-y^{2}+z^{2}=0.   Note that this variety is the set of points with Minkowski metric , relative to the origin, equal to 0. The identity in this larger group is (1,0,1,0), and the group operation is       (  a  ,  b  ,  c  ,  d  )   ×   (  w  ,  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    =   (    a  w   -   b  x    ,    a  x   +   b  w    ,    c  y   +   d  z    ,    c  z   +   d  y    )    .         a  b  c  d    w  x  y  z         a  w     b  x        a  x     b  w        c  y     d  z        c  z     d  y       (a,b,c,d)\times(w,x,y,z)=(aw-bx,ax+bw,cy+dz,cz+dy).     For the group on the unit circle, the appropriate subgroup is points of form ( w , x ,1,0), with       w  2   +   x  2    =  1   ,         superscript  w  2    superscript  x  2    1    w^{2}+x^{2}=1,   and its identity element is (1,0,1,0). The unit hyperbola group corresponds to points of form (1,0, y , z ), with       y  2   -   z  2    =  1   ,         superscript  y  2    superscript  z  2    1    y^{2}-z^{2}=1,   and the identity is again (1,0,1,0). (Of course, since they are subgroups of the larger group, they both must have the same identity element.)
