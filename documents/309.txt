   Zonal polynomial      Zonal polynomial   In mathematics , a zonal polynomial is a multivariate symmetric  homogeneous polynomial . The zonal polynomials form a basis of the space of symmetric polynomials.  They appear as zonal spherical functions of the Gelfand pairs     (   S   2  n    ,   H  n   )      subscript  S    2  n     subscript  H  n     (S_{2n},H_{n})   (here,    H  n     subscript  H  n    H_{n}   is the hyperoctahedral group) and    (   G   l  n    (  ℝ  )    ,   O  n   )       G   subscript  l  n   ℝ    subscript  O  n     (Gl_{n}(\mathbb{R}),O_{n})   , which means that they describe canonical basis of the double class algebras    ℂ   [     H  n   \   S   2  n     /   H  n    ]       ℂ   delimited-[]     normal-\   subscript  H  n    subscript  S    2  n      subscript  H  n       \mathbb{C}[H_{n}\backslash S_{2n}/H_{n}]   and    ℂ   [        O  d    (  ℝ  )    \   M  d     (  ℝ  )    /   O  d     (  ℝ  )    ]       ℂ   delimited-[]         normal-\     subscript  O  d   ℝ    subscript  M  d    ℝ    subscript  O  d    ℝ      \mathbb{C}[O_{d}(\mathbb{R})\backslash M_{d}(\mathbb{R})/O_{d}(\mathbb{R})]   .  They are applied in multivariate statistics .  The zonal polynomials are the    α  =  2      α  2    \alpha=2   case of the C normalization of the Jack function .
