   Brownian bridge      Brownian bridge   (Figure)  Brownian motion, pinned at both ends. This uses a Brownian bridge.   A Brownian bridge is a continuous-time stochastic process  B ( t ) whose probability distribution is the conditional probability distribution of a Wiener process  W ( t ) (a mathematical model of Brownian motion ) given the condition that B (1) = 0. More precisely:       B  t   :=   (   W  t   |   W  1   =  0  )   ,  t  ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]      fragments   subscript  B  t   assign   fragments  normal-(   subscript  W  t   normal-|   subscript  W  1    0  normal-)   normal-,  t    fragments  normal-[  0  normal-,  1  normal-]     B_{t}:=(W_{t}|W_{1}=0),\;t\in[0,1]     The expected value of the bridge is zero, with variance t (1 − t ), implying that the most uncertainty is in the middle of the bridge, with zero uncertainty at the nodes. The covariance of B ( s ) and B ( t ) is s (1 − t ) if s B(t) = W(t) - t W(1)\,  is a Brownian bridge for t ∈ [0, 1].  Conversely, if B ( t ) is a Brownian bridge and Z is a standard normal random variable, then the process       W   (  t  )    =    B   (  t  )    +   t   Z           W  t       B  t     t  Z      W(t)=B(t)+tZ\,     is a Wiener process for t ∈ [0, 1]. More generally, a Wiener process W ( t ) for t ∈ [0, T ] can be decomposed into        W   (  t  )    =    B   (   t  T   )    +    t   T    Z     .        W  t       B    t  T        t    T    Z      W(t)=B\left(\frac{t}{T}\right)+\frac{t}{\sqrt{T}}Z.     Another representation of the Brownian bridge based on the Brownian motion is, for t ∈ [0, 1]        B   (  t  )    =    (   1  -  t   )   W   (   t   1  -  t    )     .        B  t       1  t   W    t    1  t       B(t)=(1-t)W\left(\frac{t}{1-t}\right).     Conversely, for t ∈ [0, ∞]        W   (  t  )    =    (   1  +  t   )   B   (   t   1  +  t    )     .        W  t       1  t   B    t    1  t       W(t)=(1+t)B\left(\frac{t}{1+t}\right).     The Brownian bridge may also be represented as a Fourier series with stochastic coefficients, as       B  t   =    ∑   k  =  1   ∞     Z  k      2    sin   (   k  π  t   )      k  π           subscript  B  t     superscript   subscript     k  1         subscript  Z  k         2       k  π  t       k  π        B_{t}=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}Z_{k}\frac{\sqrt{2}\sin(k\pi t)}{k\pi}     where     Z  1   ,   Z  2   ,  …      subscript  Z  1    subscript  Z  2   normal-…    Z_{1},Z_{2},\ldots   are independent identically distributed standard normal random variables (see the Karhunen–Loève theorem ).  A Brownian bridge is the result of Donsker's theorem in the area of empirical processes . It is also used in the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test in the area of statistical inference .  Intuitive remarks  A standard Wiener process satisfies W (0) = 0 and is therefore "tied down" to the origin, but other points are not restricted. In a Brownian bridge process on the other hand, not only is B (0) = 0 but we also require that B (1) = 0, that is the process is "tied down" at t = 1 as well. Just as a literal bridge is supported by pylons at both ends, a Brownian Bridge is required to satisfy conditions at both ends of the interval [0,1]. (In a slight generalization, one sometimes requires B ( t 1 ) = a and B ( t 2 ) = b where t 1 , t 2 , a and b are known constants.)  Suppose we have generated a number of points W (0), W (1), W (2), W (3), etc. of a Wiener process path by computer simulation. It is now desired to fill in additional points in the interval [0,1], that is to interpolate between the already generated points W (0) and W (1). The solution is to use a Brownian bridge that is required to go through the values W (0) and W (1).  General case  For the general case when B ( t 1 ) = a and B ( t 2 ) = b , the distribution of B at time t ∈ ( t 1 , t 2 ) is normal , with mean      a  +     t  -   t  1      t  2   -   t  1      (   b  -  a   )        a        t   subscript  t  1       subscript  t  2    subscript  t  1       b  a      a+\frac{t-t_{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}(b-a)     and the covariance between B ( s ) and B ( t ), with s : \frac{(t_2-t)(s-t_1)}{t_2-t_1}.
