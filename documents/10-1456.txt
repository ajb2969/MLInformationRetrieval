   D-aspartate oxidase      D-aspartate oxidase   In enzymology , a D-aspartate oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-aspartate + H 2 O + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxaloacetate + NH 3 + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are D-aspartate , H 2 O , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are oxaloacetate , NH 3 , and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the FAD dependent oxidoreductase family , specifically those acting on the CH-NH 2 group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-aspartate:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating) . Other names in common use include aspartic oxidase , and D-aspartic oxidase . This enzyme participates in alanine and aspartate metabolism . It employs one cofactor , FAD .  The enzyme is encoded by DDO gene.
