Dual norm

The concept of a dual norm arises in functional analysis, a branch of mathematics.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a normed space (or, in a special case, a Banach space) over a number field 
 
 
 
  (i.e. 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 ) with norm

 
 . Then the dual (or conjugate) normed space 
 
 
 
  (another notation 
 
 
 
 ) is defined as the set of all continuous linear functionals from 
 
 
 
  into the base field 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is such a linear functional, then the dual norm1

 
  of 
 
 
 
  is defined by



With this norm, the dual space

 
  is also a normed space, and moreover a Banach space, since 
 
 
 
  is always complete.2
Examples

Dual Norm of Vectors

If p, q ∈ 
 
 
 
  satisfy 
 
 
 
 , then the ℓp and ℓq norms are dual to each other.
 
In particular the Euclidean norm is self-dual (p = q = 2). Similarly, the Schatten p-norm on matrices is dual to the Schatten q-norm.
 
For 
 
 
 
 , the dual norm is 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  positive definite.
