   L-glycol dehydrogenase      L-glycol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a L-glycol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an L-glycol + NAD(P) +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a 2-hydroxycarbonyl compound + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-glycol , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are 2-hydroxycarbonyl compound , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glycol:NAD(P) + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include glycol (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate)) , dehydrogenase , L-(+)-glycol:NAD(P) + oxidoreductase , and L-glycol:NAD(P) + dehydrogenase .
