   Category:Graph invariants      Category:Graph invariants   Graph invariants are properties of graphs that are invariant under graph isomorphisms : each is a function    f    f   f\,   such that     f   (   G  1   )    =   f   (   G  2   )          f   subscript  G  1      f   subscript  G  2      f(G_{1})=f(G_{2})\,   whenever     G  1      subscript  G  1    G_{1}\,   and     G  2      subscript  G  2    G_{2}\,   are isomorphic graphs. Examples include the number of vertices and the number of edges.  "  Invariants
