   Acid dissociation constant      Acid dissociation constant     An acid dissociation constant , K a , (also known as acidity constant , or acid-ionization constant ) is a quantitative measure of the strength of an acid in solution . It is the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction known as dissociation in the context of acid-base reactions . In aqueous solution, the equilibrium of acid dissociation can be written symbolically as:       HA  +    H  2   O    ⇌    A  -   +    H  3    O  +        normal-⇌    HA     subscript  normal-H  2   normal-O       superscript  normal-A       subscript  normal-H  3    superscript  normal-O        \mathrm{HA+H_{2}O\rightleftharpoons A^{-}+H_{3}O^{+}}     where HA is a generic acid that dissociates into A − , known as the conjugate base of the acid and a hydrogen ion which combines with a water molecule to make an hydronium ion. In the example shown in the figure, HA represents acetic acid , and A − represents the acetate ion, the conjugate base.  The chemical species HA, A − and H 3 O + are said to be in equilibrium when their concentrations do not change with the passing of time. The dissociation constant is usually written as a quotient of the equilibrium concentrations (in mol/L), denoted by [HA], [A − ] and [H 3 O + ]       K  a   =     [   A  -   ]    [    H  3    O  +    ]      [  HA  ]    [    H  2   O   ]          subscript  K  normal-a        delimited-[]   superscript  normal-A      delimited-[]     subscript  normal-H  3    superscript  normal-O          delimited-[]  HA    delimited-[]     subscript  normal-H  2   normal-O        K_{\mathrm{a}}=\mathrm{\frac{[A^{-}][H_{3}O^{+}]}{[HA][H_{2}O]}}     In all but the most concentrated aqueous solutions of an acid the concentration of water can be taken as constant and can be ignored. The definition can then be written more simply      HA  ⇌    A  -   +   H  +    :    K  a   =     [   A  -   ]    [   H  +   ]     [  HA  ]          normal-⇌  HA     superscript  normal-A     superscript  normal-H       normal-:       subscript  K  normal-a        delimited-[]   superscript  normal-A      delimited-[]   superscript  normal-H       delimited-[]  HA        \mathrm{HA\rightleftharpoons A^{-}+H^{+}}:K_{\mathrm{a}}=\mathrm{\frac{[A^{-}]%
 [H^{+}]}{[HA]}}   This is the definition in common usage. For many practical purposes it is more convenient to discuss the logarithmic constant, p K a        p    K  a    =   -    log  10    K  a           normal-p   subscript  K  normal-a        subscript   10    subscript  K  normal-a       \ \mathrm{p}K_{\mathrm{a}}=-\log_{10}K_{\mathrm{a}}     The larger the value of p K a , the smaller the extent of dissociation at any given pH (see Henderson–Hasselbalch equation )—that is, the weaker the acid. A weak acid has a p K a value in the approximate range −2 to 12 in water. Acids with a p K a value of less than about −2 are said to be strong acids ; the dissociation of a strong acid is effectively complete such that concentration of the undissociated acid is too small to be measured. p K a values for strong acids can, however, be estimated by theoretical means.  p K a , is sometimes also (but incorrectly) referred to as an acid dissociation constant.  The definition can be extended to non-aqueous solvents, such as acetonitrile and dimethylsulfoxide . Denoting a solvent molecule by S       HA  +  S   ⇌      A  -   +   SH  +    ;   K  a    =     [   A  -   ]    [   SH  +   ]      [  HA  ]    [  S  ]         normal-⇌    HA  normal-S         superscript  normal-A     superscript  SH      subscript  K  normal-a         delimited-[]   superscript  normal-A      delimited-[]   superscript  SH         delimited-[]  HA    delimited-[]  normal-S        \mathrm{HA+S\rightleftharpoons A^{-}+SH^{+}};K_{\mathrm{a}}=\mathrm{\frac{[A^{%
 -}][SH^{+}]}{[HA][S]}}   When the concentration of solvent molecules can be taken to be constant,     K  a   =     [   A  -   ]    [   H  +   ]     [  HA  ]         subscript  K  normal-a        delimited-[]   superscript  normal-A      delimited-[]   superscript  normal-H       delimited-[]  HA      K_{\mathrm{a}}=\mathrm{\frac{[A^{-}][H^{+}]}{[HA]}}   , as before.  Theoretical background  The acid dissociation constant for an acid is a direct consequence of the underlying thermodynamics of the dissociation reaction; the p K a value is directly proportional to the standard Gibbs energy change for the reaction. The value of the p K a changes with temperature and can be understood qualitatively based on Le Chatelier's principle : when the reaction is endothermic , the p K a decreases with increasing temperature; the opposite is true for exothermic reactions.  The value of p K a also depends on molecular structure in many ways. For example, Pauling proposed two rules: one for successive p K a of polyprotic acids (see Polyprotic acids below), and one to estimate the p K a of oxyacids based on the number of =O and −OH groups (see Factors that affect p K a values below). Other structural factors that influence the magnitude of the acid dissociation constant include inductive effects , mesomeric effects , and hydrogen bonding .  The quantitative behaviour of acids and bases in solution can be understood only if their p K a values are known. In particular, the pH of a solution can be predicted when the analytical concentration and p K a values of all acids and bases are known; conversely, it is possible to calculate the equilibrium concentration of the acids and bases in solution when the pH is known. These calculations find application in many different areas of chemistry, biology, medicine, and geology. For example, many compounds used for medication are weak acids or bases, and a knowledge of the p K a values, together with the water–octanol partition coefficient , can be used for estimating the extent to which the compound enters the blood stream. Acid dissociation constants are also essential in aquatic chemistry and chemical oceanography , where the acidity of water plays a fundamental role. In living organisms, acid-base homeostasis and enzyme kinetics are dependent on the p K a values of the many acids and bases present in the cell and in the body. In chemistry, a knowledge of p K a values is necessary for the preparation of buffer solutions and is also a prerequisite for a quantitative understanding of the interaction between acids or bases and metal ions to form complexes . Experimentally, p K a values can be determined by potentiometric (pH) titration , but for values of p K a less than about 2 or more than about 11, spectrophotometric or NMR measurements may be required due to practical difficulties with pH measurements.  Definitions  According to Arrhenius 's original definition, an acid is a substance that dissociates in aqueous solution, releasing the hydrogen ion H + (a proton): 1   HA  A − + H + .   The equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction is known as a dissociation constant . The liberated proton combines with a water molecule to give a hydronium (or oxonium) ion H 3 O + (naked protons do not exist in solution), and so Arrhenius later proposed that the dissociation should be written as an acid–base reaction :   HA + H 2 O  A − + H 3 O + .    Brønsted and Lowry generalised this further to a proton exchange reaction: 2 3 4   acid + base  conjugate base + conjugate acid.   The acid loses a proton, leaving a conjugate base; the proton is transferred to the base, creating a conjugate acid. For aqueous solutions of an acid HA, the base is water; the conjugate base is A − and the conjugate acid is the hydronium ion. The Brønsted–Lowry definition applies to other solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide : the solvent S acts as a base, accepting a proton and forming the conjugate acid SH + .   HA + S  A − + SH + .   In solution chemistry, it is common to use H + as an abbreviation for the solvated hydrogen ion, regardless of the solvent. In aqueous solution H + denotes a solvated hydronium ion rather than a proton. 5 6  The designation of an acid or base as "conjugate" depends on the context. The conjugate acid BH + of a base B dissociates according to   BH + + OH − B + H 2 O   which is the reverse of the equilibrium   H 2 O (acid) + B (base)  OH − (conjugate base) + BH + (conjugate acid).   The hydroxide ion OH − , a well known base, is here acting as the conjugate base of the acid water. Acids and bases are thus regarded simply as donors and acceptors of protons respectively.  A broader definition of acid dissociation includes hydrolysis , in which protons are produced by the splitting of water molecules. For example, boric acid (B(OH) 3 ) produces H 3 O + as if it were a proton donor, 7 but it has been confirmed by Raman spectroscopy that this is due to the hydrolysis equilibrium: 8   B(OH) 3 + 2 H 2 O  B(OH) 4 − + H 3 O + .   Similarly, metal ion hydrolysis causes ions such as [Al(H 2 O) 6 ] 3+ to behave as weak acids: 9   [Al(H 2 O) 6 ] 3+ +H 2 O  [Al(H 2 O) 5 (OH)] 2+ + H 3 O + .   According to Lewis 's original definition, an acid is a substance that accepts an electron pair to form a coordinate covalent bond : 10  Equilibrium constant  An acid dissociation constant is a particular example of an equilibrium constant . For the specific equilibrium between a monoprotic acid , HA and its conjugate base A − , in water,   HA + H 2 O  A − + H 3 O +    the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, K can be defined by 11        K  ⊖   =     {   A  -   }    {    H  3    O  +    }      {  HA  }    {    H  2   O   }          superscript  K  symmetric-difference         superscript  normal-A         subscript  normal-H  3    superscript  normal-O          HA       subscript  normal-H  2   normal-O        K^{\ominus}=\mathrm{\frac{\{A^{-}\}\{H_{3}O^{+}\}}{\{HA\}\{H_{2}O\}}}      where {A} is the activity of the chemical species A etc. K is dimensionless since activity is dimensionless. Activities of the products of dissociation are placed in the numerator, activities of the reactants are placed in the denominator. See activity coefficient for a derivation of this expression.  Since activity is the product of concentration and activity coefficient (γ) the definition could also be written as        K  ⊖   =      [   A  -   ]    [    H  3    O  +    ]      [  HA  ]    [    H  2   O   ]     ×      γ   A  -      γ    H  3    O  +         γ  HA     γ    H  2   O       =      [   A  -   ]    [    H  3    O  +    ]      [  HA  ]    [    H  2   O   ]     ×  Γ          superscript  K  symmetric-difference          delimited-[]   superscript  normal-A      delimited-[]     subscript  normal-H  3    superscript  normal-O          delimited-[]  HA    delimited-[]     subscript  normal-H  2   normal-O           subscript  γ   superscript  normal-A      subscript  γ     subscript  normal-H  3    superscript  normal-O          subscript  γ  HA    subscript  γ     subscript  normal-H  2   normal-O                   delimited-[]   superscript  normal-A      delimited-[]     subscript  normal-H  3    superscript  normal-O          delimited-[]  HA    delimited-[]     subscript  normal-H  2   normal-O      normal-Γ      K^{\ominus}=\mathrm{\frac{[A^{-}][H_{3}O^{+}]}{[HA][H_{2}O]}\times\frac{\gamma%
 _{A^{-}}\ \gamma_{H_{3}O^{+}}}{\gamma_{HA}\ \gamma_{H_{2}O}}=\mathrm{\frac{[A^%
 {-}][H_{3}O^{+}]}{[HA][H_{2}O]}}\times\Gamma}      where [HA] represents the concentration of HA and   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is a quotient of activity coefficients.  To avoid the complications involved in using activities, dissociation constants are determined , where possible, in a medium of high ionic strength , that is, under conditions in which   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   can be assumed to be always constant. 12 For example, the medium might be a solution of 0.1 M sodium nitrate or 3 M potassium perchlorate (1 M = 1 mol·dm −3 , a unit of molar concentration ). Furthermore, in all but the most concentrated solutions it can be assumed that the concentration of water, [H 2 O], is constant, approximately 55 mol·dm −3 . On dividing K by the constant terms and writing [H + ] for the concentration of the hydronium ion the expression        K  a   =     [   A  -   ]    [   H  +   ]     [  HA  ]         subscript  K  normal-a        delimited-[]   superscript  normal-A      delimited-[]   superscript  normal-H       delimited-[]  HA      K_{\mathrm{a}}=\mathrm{\frac{[A^{-}][H^{+}]}{[HA]}}      is obtained. This is the definition in common use. 13 p K a is defined as −log 10  K a . Note, however, that all published dissociation constant values refer to the specific ionic medium used in their determination and that different values are obtained with different conditions, as shown for acetic acid in the illustration above. When published constants refer to an ionic strength other than the one required for a particular application, they may be adjusted by means of specific ion theory (SIT) and other theories. 14  Although K a appears to have the dimension of concentration, the exact definition uses chemical activities, which are dimensionless. Therefore, K a , as defined properly, is also dimensionless. Nevertheless it is not unusual, particularly in texts relating to biochemical equilibria, to see a value quoted with a dimension as, for example, " K a = 300 M".  Monoprotic acids  After rearranging the expression defining K a , and putting pH = −log 10 [H + ], one obtains 15       pH  =    p   K  a    +   log    [   A  -   ]    [  HA  ]          pH      normal-p   subscript  K  normal-a         delimited-[]   superscript  normal-A      delimited-[]  HA        \mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{p}K_{\mathrm{a}}+\log\mathrm{\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}}      This is a form of the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation , from which the following conclusions can be drawn.   At half-neutralization [A − ]/[HA] = 1; since log(1) =0, the pH at half-neutralization is numerically equal to p K a . Conversely, when pH = p K a , the concentration of HA is equal to the concentration of A − .  The buffer region extends over the approximate range p K a ± 2, though buffering is weak outside the range p K a ± 1. At p K a ± 1, [A − ]/[HA] = 10 or 1/10.  If the pH is known, the ratio may be calculated. This ratio is independent of the analytical concentration of the acid.   In water, measurable p K a values range from about −2 for a strong acid to about 12 for a very weak acid (or strong base). All acids with a p K a value of less than −2 are more than 99% dissociated at pH 0 (1 M acid). This is known as solvent leveling since all such acids are brought to the same level of being strong acids , regardless of their p K a values. Likewise, all bases with a p K a value larger than the upper limit are more than 99% protonated at all attainable pH values and are classified as strong bases . 16  An example of a strong acid is hydrochloric acid , HCl, which has a p K a value, estimated from thermodynamic quantities, of −9.3 in water. 17 The concentration of undissociated acid in a 1 mol·dm −3 solution will be less than 0.01% of the concentrations of the products of dissociation. Hydrochloric acid is said to be "fully dissociated" in aqueous solution because the amount of undissociated acid is imperceptible. When the p K a and analytical concentration of the acid are known, the extent of dissociation and pH of a solution of a monoprotic acid can be easily calculated using an ICE table .  A buffer solution of a desired pH can be prepared as a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base. In practice the mixture can be created by dissolving the acid in water, and adding the requisite amount of strong acid or base. The p K a of the acid must be less than two units different from the target pH.  Polyprotic acids  (Figure)  Phosphoric acid speciation   Polyprotic acids are acids that can lose more than one proton. The constant for dissociation of the first proton may be denoted as K a1 and the constants for dissociation of successive protons as K a2 , etc. Phosphoric acid , H 3 PO 4 , is an example of a polyprotic acid as it can lose three protons.        equilibrium   p K a value The values are for 25°C and zero ionic strength — {{cite journal   last1=Powell|first1=Kipton J.   last2=Brown|= | first2=Paul L.   last3=Byrne | first3=Robert H.   last4=Gajda | first4=Tamás   last5=Hefter | first5=Glenn   last6=Sjöberg | first6=Staffan   last7=Wanner | first7=Hans   title=Chemical speciation of environmentally significant heavy metals with inorganic ligands.

The species distribution diagram shows that the concentrations of the two ions are maximum at pH 5.5 and 10.  When the difference between successive p K values is less than about four there is overlap between the pH range of existence of the species in equilibrium. The smaller the difference, the more the overlap. The case of citric acid is shown at the right; solutions of citric acid are buffered over the whole range of pH 2.5 to 7.5.  According to Pauling's first rule, successive p K values of a given acid increase (p K a2 > p K a1 ). 19 For oxyacids with more than one ionizable hydrogen on the same atom, the pK a values often increase by about 5 units for each proton removed, 20 21 as in the example of phosphoric acid above.  In the case of a diprotic acid, H 2 A, the two equilibria are   H 2 A  HA − + H +   HA − A 2− + H +    it can be seen that the second proton is removed from a negatively charged species. Since the proton carries a positive charge extra work is needed to remove it; that is the cause of the trend noted above. Phosphoric acid values (above) illustrate this rule, as do the values for vanadic acid , H 3 VO 4 . When an exception to the rule is found it indicates that a major change in structure is occurring. In the case of VO 2 + (aq), the vanadium is octahedral , 6-coordinate, whereas vanadic acid is tetrahedral , 4-coordinate. This is the basis for an explanation of why p K a1 > p K a2 for vanadium(V) oxoacids.        equilibrium   p K a value       [VO 2 (H 2 O) 4 ] + H 3 VO 4 + H + + 2H 2 O   p K a1 = 4.2     H 3 VO 4 H 2 VO 4 − + H +   p K a2 = 2.60     H 2 VO 4 − HVO 4 2− + H +   p K a3 = 7.92     HVO 4 2− VO 4 3− + H +   p K a4 = 13.27       Isoelectric point  For substances in solution the isoelectric point (pI) is defined as the pH at which the sum, weighted by charge value, of concentrations of positively charged species is equal to the weighted sum of concentrations of negatively charged species. In the case that there is one species of each type, the isoelectric point can be obtained directly from the pK values. Take the example of glycine , defined as AH. There are two dissociation equilibria to consider.   AH 2 + AH + H + ; [AH][H + ] = K 1 [AH 2 + ]  AH  A − + H + ; [A − ][H + ] = K 2 [AH]   Substitute the expression for [AH] into the first equation   [A − ][H + ] 2 = K 1 K 2 [AH 2 + ]   At the isoelectric point the concentration of the positively charged species, AH 2 + , is equal to the concentration of the negatively charged species, A − , so   [H + ] 2 = K 1 K 2    Therefore, taking cologarithms , the pH is given by       p  I   =     p   K  1    +   p   K  2     2         normal-p  I         normal-p   subscript  K  1      normal-p   subscript  K  2     2     \mathrm{p}I=\frac{\mathrm{p}K_{1}+\mathrm{p}K_{2}}{2}   pI values for amino acids are listed at Proteinogenic amino acid#Chemical properties . When more than two charged species are in equilibrium with each other a full speciation calculation may be needed.  Water self-ionization  Water possesses both acidic and basic properties. It is amphiprotic . The equilibrium constant for the equilibrium   2 H 2 O  OH − + H 3 O +    is given by        K  a   =     [    H  3    O  +    ]    [   OH  -   ]     [    H  2   O   ]         subscript  K  normal-a        delimited-[]     subscript  normal-H  3    superscript  normal-O       delimited-[]   superscript  OH       delimited-[]     subscript  normal-H  2   normal-O       K_{\mathrm{a}}=\mathrm{\frac{[H_{3}O^{+}][OH^{-}]}{[H_{2}O]}}      When, as is usually the case, the concentration of water can be assumed to be constant, this expression may be replaced by        K  w   =    [    H  3    O  +    ]    [   OH  -   ]         subscript  K  normal-w      delimited-[]     subscript  normal-H  3    superscript  normal-O       delimited-[]   superscript  OH        K_{\mathrm{w}}=[\mathrm{H_{3}O}^{+}][\mathrm{OH}^{-}]\,      The self-ionization constant of water, K w , is thus just a special case of an acid dissociation constant.      p K w values for pure water at various temperatures 22     T/°C     p K w     These data can be fitted to a parabola with   p K w = 14.94 - 0.04209 T + 0.0001718 T 2    From this equation, p K w = 14 at 24.87 °C. At that temperature both hydrogen and hydroxide ions have a concentration of 10 −7 mol dm −3 .  Amphoteric substances  An amphoteric substance is one that can act as an acid or as a base, depending on pH. Water (above) is amphoteric. Another example of an amphoteric molecule is the bicarbonate ion HCO 3 − that is the conjugate base of the carbonic acid molecule H 2 CO 3 in the equilibrium   H 2 CO 3 + H 2 O  HCO 3 − + H 3 O +    but also the conjugate acid of the carbonate ion CO 3 2− in (the reverse of) the equilibrium   HCO 3 − + OH − CO 3 2− + H 2 O.   Carbonic acid equilibria are important for acid-base homeostasis in the human body.  An amino acid is also amphoteric with the added complication that the neutral molecule is subject to an internal acid-base equilibrium in which the basic amino group attracts and binds the proton from the acidic carboxyl group, forming a zwitterion .   NH 2 CHRCO 2 H  NH 3 + CHRCO 2 −    At pH less than about 5 both the carboxylate group and the amino group are protonated. As pH increases the acid dissociates according to   NH 3 + CHRCO 2 H  NH 3 + CHRCO 2 − + H +    At high pH a second dissociation may take place.   NH 3 + CHRCO 2 − NH 2 CHRCO 2 − + H +    Thus the zwitter ion, NH 3 + CHRCO 2 − , is amphoteric because it may either be protonated or deprotonated.  Bases and basicity  Historically, the equilibrium constant K b for a base has been defined as the association constant for protonation of the base, B, to form the conjugate acid, HB + .   B + H 2 O  HB + + OH −    Using similar reasoning to that used before        K  b   =     [   HB  +   ]    [   OH  -   ]     [  B  ]         subscript  K  normal-b        delimited-[]   superscript  HB      delimited-[]   superscript  OH       delimited-[]  normal-B      K_{\mathrm{b}}=\mathrm{\frac{[HB^{+}][OH^{-}]}{[B]}}      K b is related to K a for the conjugate acid. In water, the concentration of the hydroxide ion, [OH − ], is related to the concentration of the hydrogen ion by K w = [H + ] [OH − ], therefore        [   OH  -   ]   =    K  w    [   H  +   ]         delimited-[]   superscript  OH        subscript  K  normal-w    delimited-[]   superscript  normal-H        \mathrm{[OH^{-}]}=\frac{K_{\mathrm{w}}}{\mathrm{[H^{+}]}}      Substitution of the expression for [OH − ] into the expression for K b gives        K  b   =     [   HB  +   ]    K  w      [  B  ]    [   H  +   ]     =    K  w    K  a           subscript  K  normal-b        delimited-[]   superscript  HB      subscript  K  normal-w       delimited-[]  normal-B    delimited-[]   superscript  normal-H               subscript  K  normal-w    subscript  K  normal-a       K_{\mathrm{b}}=\frac{[\mathrm{HB^{+}}]K_{\mathrm{w}}}{\mathrm{[B][H^{+}]}}=%
 \frac{K_{\mathrm{w}}}{K_{\mathrm{a}}}      When K a , K b and K w are determined under the same conditions of temperature and ionic strength, it follows, taking cologarithms , that p K b or "basicity"= p K w − p K a . In aqueous solutions at 25 °C, p K w is 13.9965, 23 so       p   K  b    ≈   14  -   p   K  a           p   subscript  K  normal-b      14    p   subscript  K  normal-a       pK_{\mathrm{b}}\approx 14-pK_{\mathrm{a}}   with sufficient accuracy for most practical purposes. In effect there is no need to define p K b separately from p K a , but it is done here as often only p K b values can be found in the older literature.  Temperature dependence  All equilibrium constants vary with temperature according to the van 't Hoff equation 24          d  ln   K    d  T    =    Δ   H  ⊖     R   T  2             normal-d    K    normal-d  T        normal-Δ   superscript  H  symmetric-difference      R   superscript  T  2       \frac{\operatorname{d}\ln K}{\operatorname{d}T}=\frac{{\Delta H}^{\ominus}}{RT%
 ^{2}}      R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature . Thus, for exothermic reactions, (the standard enthalpy change , Δ H , is negative) K decreases with temperature, but for endothermic reactions (Δ H is positive) K increases with temperature.  Acidity in nonaqueous solutions  A solvent will be more likely to promote ionization of a dissolved acidic molecule in the following circumstances: 25   It is a protic solvent , capable of forming hydrogen bonds.  It has a high donor number , making it a strong Lewis base .  It has a high dielectric constant (relative permittivity), making it a good solvent for ionic species.   p K a values of organic compounds are often obtained using the aprotic solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 26 and acetonitrile (ACN). 27      Solvent properties at 25 °C     Solvent     Acetonitrile     Dimethylsulfoxide     Water     DMSO is widely used as an alternative to water because it has a lower dielectric constant than water, and is less polar and so dissolves non-polar, hydrophobic substances more easily. It has a measurable p K a range of about 1 to 30. Acetonitrile is less basic than DMSO, and, so, in general, acids are weaker and bases are stronger in this solvent. Some p K a values at 25 °C for acetonitrile (ACN) 28 29 30 and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 31 are shown in the following tables. Values for water are included for comparison.      p K a values of acids     HA  A − + H +     p -Toluenesulfonic acid     2,4-Dinitrophenol     Benzoic acid     Acetic acid     Phenol     BH + B + H +     Pyrrolidine     Triethylamine     Proton sponge     Pyridine     Aniline     Ionization of acids is less in an acidic solvent than in water. For example, hydrogen chloride is a weak acid when dissolved in acetic acid . This is because acetic acid is a much weaker base than water.   HCl + CH 3 CO 2 H  Cl − + CH 3 C(OH) 2 +   acid + base  conjugate base + conjugate acid   Compare this reaction with what happens when acetic acid is dissolved in the more acidic solvent pure sulfuric acid 32   H 2 SO 4 + CH 3 CO 2 H  HSO 4 − + CH 3 C(OH) 2 +    The unlikely geminal diol species CH 3 C(OH) 2 + is stable in these environments. For aqueous solutions the pH scale is the most convenient acidity function . 33 Other acidity functions have been proposed for non-aqueous media, the most notable being the Hammett acidity function , H 0 , for superacid media and its modified version H − for superbasic media. 34  In aprotic solvents, oligomers , such as the well-known acetic acid dimer , may be formed by hydrogen bonding. An acid may also form hydrogen bonds to its conjugate base. This process, known as homoconjugation , has the effect of enhancing the acidity of acids, lowering their effective p K a values, by stabilizing the conjugate base. Homoconjugation enhances the proton-donating power of toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile solution by a factor of nearly 800. 35 In aqueous solutions, homoconjugation does not occur, because water forms stronger hydrogen bonds to the conjugate base than does the acid.  Mixed solvents  When a compound has limited solubility in water it is common practice (in the pharmaceutical industry, for example) to determine p K a values in a solvent mixture such as water/ dioxane or water/ methanol , in which the compound is more soluble. 36 In the example shown at the right, the p K a value rises steeply with increasing percentage of dioxane as the dielectric constant of the mixture is decreasing.  A p K a value obtained in a mixed solvent cannot be used directly for aqueous solutions. The reason for this is that when the solvent is in its standard state its activity is defined as one. For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that solvent mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the p K a value for use with aqueous solutions it has to be extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.  These facts are obscured by the omission of the solvent from the expression that is normally used to define p K a , but p K a values obtained in a given mixed solvent can be compared to each other, giving relative acid strengths. The same is true of p K a values obtained in a particular non-aqueous solvent such a DMSO.  As of 2008, a universal, solvent-independent, scale for acid dissociation constants has not been developed, since there is no known way to compare the standard states of two different solvents.  Factors that affect p K a values  Pauling's second rule is that the value of the first p K a for acids of the formula XO m (OH) n depends primarily on the number of oxo groups m, and is approximately independent of the number of hydroxy groups n, and also of the central atom X. Approximate values of p K a are 8 for m = 0, 2 for m = 1, −3 for m = 2 and  Alternatively, various numerical formulas have been proposed including p K a = 8 − 5n (known as Bell's rule), 37 38 p K a = 7 − 5n, 39 40 or p K a = 9 − 7n. 41 The dependence on m correlates with the oxidation state of the central atom, X: the higher the oxidation state the stronger the oxyacid. For example, p K a for HClO is 7.2, for HClO 2 is 2.0, for HClO 3 is −1 and HClO 4 is a strong acid (p K a This rule can help assign molecular structure: for example phosphorous acid (H 3 PO 3 ) has a p K a near 2 suggested that the structure is HPO(OH) 2 , as later confirmed by NMR spectroscopy , and not P(OH) 3 which would be expected to have a p K a near 8. 42  With organic acids inductive effects and mesomeric effects affect the p K a values. A simple example is provided by the effect of replacing the hydrogen atoms in acetic acid by the more electronegative chlorine atom. The electron-withdrawing effect of the substituent makes ionisation easier, so successive p K a values decrease in the series 4.7, 2.8, 1.4 and 0.7 when 0,1, 2 or 3 chlorine atoms are present. 43 The Hammett equation , provides a general expression for the effect of substituents. 44   log K a = log K a 0 + ρσ.   K a is the dissociation constant of a substituted compound, K a 0 is the dissociation constant when the substituent is hydrogen, ρ is a property of the unsubstituted compound and σ has a particular value for each substituent. A plot of log K a against σ is a straight line with intercept log K a 0 and slope ρ. This is an example of a linear free energy relationship as log K a is proportional to the standard fee energy change. Hammett originally 45 formulated the relationship with data from benzoic acid with different substiuents in the ortho- and para- positions: some numerical values are in Hammett equation . This and other studies allowed substituents to be ordered according to their electron-withdrawing or electron-releasing power, and to distinguish between inductive and mesomeric effects. 46 47  Alcohols do not normally behave as acids in water, but the presence of a double bond adjacent to the OH group can substantially decrease the p K a by the mechanism of keto-enol tautomerism . Ascorbic acid is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione ( acetylacetone ) is also a weak acid because of the keto-enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol , which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.  Structural effects can also be important. The difference between fumaric acid and maleic acid is a classic example. Fumaric acid is (E)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid, a trans  isomer , whereas maleic acid is the corresponding cis isomer, i.e. (Z)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid (see cis-trans isomerism ). Fumaric acid has p K a values of approximately 3.0 and 4.5. By contrast, maleic acid has p K a values of approximately 1.5 and 6.5. The reason for this large difference is that when one proton is removed from the cis- isomer (maleic acid) a strong intramolecular  hydrogen bond is formed with the nearby remaining carboxyl group. This favors the formation of the maleate H + , and it opposes the removal of the second proton from that species. In the trans isomer, the two carboxyl groups are always far apart, so hydrogen bonding is not observed. 48  Proton sponge , 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene, has a p K a value of 12.1. It is one of the strongest amine bases known. The high basicity is attributed to the relief of strain upon protonation and strong internal hydrogen bonding. 49 50  Effects of the solvent and solvation should be mentioned also in this section. It turns out, these influences are more subtle than that of a dielectric medium mentioned above. For example, the expected (by electronic effects of methyl substituents) and observed in gas phase order of basicity of methylamines, Me 3 N > Me 2 NH > MeNH 2 > NH 3 , is changed by water to Me 2 NH > MeNH 2 > Me 3 N > NH 3 . Neutral methylamine molecules are hydrogen-bonded to water molecules mailnly through one acceptor, N-HOH, interaction and only occasionally just one more donor bond, NH-OH 2 . Hence, methylamines are stabilized to about the same extent by hydration, regardless of the number of methyl groups. In stark contrast, corresponding methylammonium cations always utilize all the available protons for donor NH-OH 2 bonding. Relative stabilization of methylammonium ions thus decreases with the number of methyl groups explaining the order of water basicity of methylamines. 51  Thermodynamics  An equilibrium constant is related to the standard Gibbs energy change for the reaction, so for an acid dissociation constant   Δ G = − RT ln K a ≈ 2.303 RT p K a .   R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature . Note that p K a = −log K a and 2.303 ≈ ln 10. At 25 °C Δ G in kJ·mol −1 = 5.708 p K a (1 kJ·mol −1 = 1000 Joules per mole ). Free energy is made up of an enthalpy term and an entropy term. 52   Δ G = Δ H − T Δ S    The standard enthalpy change can be determined by calorimetry or by using the van 't Hoff equation , though the calorimetric method is preferable. When both the standard enthalpy change and acid dissociation constant have been determined, the standard entropy change is easily calculated from the equation above. In the following table, the entropy terms are calculated from the experimental values of p K a and Δ H . The data were critically selected and refer to 25 °C and zero ionic strength, in water. 53      Acids   Compound   Equilibrium   p K a   Δ G /kJ·mol −1   Δ H /kJ·mol −1   — T Δ S /kJ·mol −1     HA = Acetic acid   HA  H + + A −   4.756   27.147 †   −0.41   27.56 ‡     H 2 A + = GlycineH +   H 2 A + HA + H +   2.351   13.420   4.00   9.419      HA  H + + A −   9.78   55.825   44.20   11.6     H 2 A = Maleic acid   H 2 A  HA − + H +   1.92   10.76   1.10   9.85      HA − H + + A 2−   6.27   35.79   −3.60   39.4     H 3 A = Citric acid   H 3 A  H 2 A − + H +   3.128   17.855   4.07   13.78      H 2 A − HA 2− + H +   4.76   27.176   2.23   24.9      HA 2− A 3− + H +   6.40   36.509   −3.38   39.9     H 3 A = Boric acid   H 3 A  H 2 A − + H +   9.237   52.725   13.80   38.92     H 3 A = Phosphoric acid   H 3 A  H 2 A − + H +   2.148   12.261   −8.00   20.26      H 2 A − HA 2− + H +   7.20   41.087   3.60   37.5      HA 2− A 3− + H +   12.35   80.49   16.00   54.49     HA − = Hydrogen sulfate   HA − A 2− + H +   1.99   11.36   −22.40   33.74     H 2 A = Oxalic acid   H 2 A  HA − + H +   1.27   7.27   −3.90   11.15      HA − A 2− + H +   4.266   24.351   7.00   31.35      † Δ G = 2.303RT pK a   ‡ Computed here, from ΔH and ΔG values supplied in the citation, using —TΔ S = Δ G — Δ H        Conjugate acids of bases   Compound   Equilibrium   p K a   Δ H /kJ·mol −1   — T Δ S /kJ·mol −1     B = Ammonia   HB + B + H +   9.245   51.95   0.8205     B = Methylamine   HB + B + H +   10.645   55.34   5.422     B = Triethylamine   HB + B + H +   10.72   43.13   18.06     The first point to note is that, when p K a is positive, the standard free energy change for the dissociation reaction is also positive. Second, some reactions are exothermic and some are endothermic , but, when Δ H is negative − T Δ S is the dominant factor, which determines that Δ G is positive. Last, the entropy contribution is always unfavourable (Δ S The ionization of a neutral acid involves formation of two ions so that the entropy decreases (Δ S a values is commonly performed by means of titrations , in a medium of high ionic strength and at constant temperature. 54 A typical procedure would be as follows. A solution of the compound in the medium is acidified with a strong acid to the point where the compound is fully protonated. The solution is then titrated with a strong base until all the protons have been removed. At each point in the titration pH is measured using a glass electrode and a pH meter . The equilibrium constants are found by fitting calculated pH values to the observed values, using the method of least squares . 55  The total volume of added strong base should be small compared to the initial volume of titrand solution in order to keep the ionic strength nearly constant. This will ensure that p K a remains invariant during the titration.  A calculated titration curve for oxalic acid is shown at the right. Oxalic acid has p K a values of 1.27 and 4.27. Therefore the buffer regions will be centered at about pH 1.3 and pH 4.3. The buffer regions carry the information necessary to get the p K a values as the concentrations of acid and conjugate base change along a buffer region.  Between the two buffer regions there is an end-point, or equivalence point , at about pH 3. This end-point is not sharp and is typical of a diprotic acid whose buffer regions overlap by a small amount: p K a2 − p K a1 is about three in this example. (If the difference in p K values were about two or less, the end-point would not be noticeable.) The second end-point begins at about pH 6.3 and is sharp. This indicates that all the protons have been removed. When this is so, the solution is not buffered and the pH rises steeply on addition of a small amount of strong base. However, the pH does not continue to rise indefinitely. A new buffer region begins at about pH 11 (p K w − 3), which is where self-ionization of water becomes important.  It is very difficult to measure pH values of less than two in aqueous solution with a glass electrode , because the Nernst equation breaks down at such low pH values. To determine p K values of less than about 2 or more than about 11 spectrophotometric 56  57 or NMR 58 59 measurements may be used instead of, or combined with, pH measurements.  When the glass electrode cannot be employed, as with non-aqueous solutions, spectrophotometric methods are frequently used. 60 These may involve absorbance or fluorescence measurements. In both cases the measured quantity is assumed to be proportional to the sum of contributions from each photo-active species; with absorbance measurements the Beer-Lambert law is assumed to apply.  Aqueous solutions with normal water cannot be used for 1 H NMR measurements but heavy water , D 2 O, must be used instead. 13 C NMR data, however, can be used with normal water and 1 H NMR spectra can be used with non-aqueous media. The quantities measured with NMR are time-averaged chemical shifts , as proton exchange is fast on the NMR time-scale. Other chemical shifts, such as those of 31 P can be measured.  Micro-constants  A base such as spermine has a few different sites where protonation can occur. In this example the first proton can go on the terminal -NH 2 group, or either of the internal -NH- groups. The p K a values for dissociation of spermine protonated at one or other of the sites are examples of micro-constants . They cannot be determined directly by means of pH, absorbance, fluorescence or NMR measurements. Nevertheless, the site of protonation is very important for biological function, so mathematical methods have been developed for the determination of micro-constants. 61  Applications and significance  A knowledge of p K a values is important for the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry ; for example, the p K a values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. 62  Protein p K a values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; 63 the design of these solutions depends on a knowledge of the p K a values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS , which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine , which is used in gel electrophoresis . 64 65 Buffering is an essential part of acid base physiology including acid-base homeostasis , 66 and is key to understanding disorders such as acid-base imbalance . 67 68 69 The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its p K values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing , 70 which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .  Buffer solutions also play a key role in analytical chemistry . They are used whenever there is a need to fix the pH of a solution at a particular value. Compared with an aqueous solution, the pH of a buffer solution is relatively insensitive to the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base. The buffer capacity 71 of a simple buffer solution is largest when pH = p K a . In acid-base extraction , the efficiency of extraction of a compound into an organic phase, such as an ether , can be optimised by adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase using an appropriate buffer. At the optimum pH, the concentration of the electrically neutral species is maximised; such a species is more soluble in organic solvents having a low dielectric constant than it is in water. This technique is used for the purification of weak acids and bases. 72  A pH indicator is a weak acid or weak base that changes colour in the transition pH range, which is approximately p K a ± 1. The design of a universal indicator requires a mixture of indicators whose adjacent p K a values differ by about two, so that their transition pH ranges just overlap.  In pharmacology ionization of a compound alters its physical behaviour and macro properties such as solubility and lipophilicity (log p). For example ionization of any compound will increase the solubility in water, but decrease the lipophilicity. This is exploited in drug development to increase the concentration of a compound in the blood by adjusting the p K a of an ionizable group. 73  Knowledge of p K a values is important for the understanding of coordination complexes , which are formed by the interaction of a metal ion, M m+ , acting as a Lewis acid , with a ligand , L, acting as a Lewis base . However, the ligand may also undergo protonation reactions, so the formation of a complex in aqueous solution could be represented symbolically by the reaction    [M(H 2 O) n ] m + +LH  [M(H 2 O) n −1 L] ( m −1)+ + H 3 O +      To determine the equilibrium constant for this reaction, in which the ligand loses a proton, the p K a of the protonated ligand must be known. In practice, the ligand may be polyprotic; for example EDTA 4− can accept four protons; in that case, all p K a values must be known. In addition, the metal ion is subject to hydrolysis , that is, it behaves as a weak acid, so the p K values for the hydrolysis reactions must also be known. 74 Assessing the hazard associated with an acid or base may require a knowledge of p K a values. 75 For example, hydrogen cyanide is a very toxic gas, because the cyanide ion inhibits the iron-containing enzyme cytochrome c oxidase . Hydrogen cyanide is a weak acid in aqueous solution with a p K a of about 9. In strongly alkaline solutions, above pH 11, say, it follows that sodium cyanide is "fully dissociated" so the hazard due to the hydrogen cyanide gas is much reduced. An acidic solution, on the other hand, is very hazardous because all the cyanide is in its acid form. Ingestion of cyanide by mouth is potentially fatal, independently of pH, because of the reaction with cytochrome c oxidase.  In environmental science acid–base equilibria are important for lakes 76 and rivers; 77 78 for example, humic acids are important components of natural waters. Another example occurs in chemical oceanography : 79 in order to quantify the solubility of iron(III) in seawater at various salinities , the p K a values for the formation of the iron(III) hydrolysis products Fe(OH) 2+ , Fe(OH) 2 + and Fe(OH) 3 were determined, along with the solubility product of iron hydroxide . 80  Values for common substances  There are multiple techniques to determine the p K a of a chemical, leading to some discrepancies between different sources. Well measured values are typically within 0.1 units of each other. Data presented here were taken at 25 °C in water. 81 82 More values can be found in thermodynamics , above.
