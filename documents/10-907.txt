   Cholestenone 5alpha-reductase      Cholestenone 5alpha-reductase   In enzymology , a cholestenone 5alpha-reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5alpha-cholestan-3-one + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cholest-4-en-3-one + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5alpha-cholestan-3-one and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are cholest-4-en-3-one , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-oxo-5alpha-steroid:NADP+ Delta4-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include testosterone Delta4-5alpha-reductase , steroid 5alpha-reductase , 3-oxosteroid Delta4-dehydrogenase , 5alpha-reductase , steroid 5alpha-hydrogenase , 3-oxosteroid 5alpha-reductase , testosterone Delta4-hydrogenase , 4-ene-3-oxosteroid 5alpha-reductase , reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , phosphate:Delta4-3-ketosteroid 5alpha-oxidoreductase , 4-ene-5alpha-reductase , Delta4-3-ketosteroid 5alpha-oxidoreductase , cholest-4-en-3-one 5alpha-reductase , and testosterone 5alpha-reductase .
