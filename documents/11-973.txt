   Propanoyl-CoA C-acyltransferase      Propanoyl-CoA C-acyltransferase   In enzymology , a propanoyl-CoA C-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholanoyl-CoA + propanoyl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-24-oxo-5beta-cholestanoyl-CoA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholanoyl-CoA and propanoyl-CoA , whereas its two products are CoA and 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-24-oxo-5beta-cholestanoyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholanoyl-CoA:propanoyl-CoA C-acyltransferase . Other names in common use include peroxisomal thiolase 2 , sterol carrier protein- , SCP , and PTE-2 (ambiguous) . This enzyme participates in ppar signaling pathway .  Propanoyl-CoA C-acyltransferase belongs to the thiolase family of enzymes.  References        "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
