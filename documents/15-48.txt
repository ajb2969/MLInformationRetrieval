   Magnussen model      Magnussen model   Magnussen model is a popular method for computing reaction rates as a function of both mean concentrations and turbulence levels. 1 Originally developed for combustion , it can also be used for liquid reactions by tuning some of its parameters. The model consists of rates calculated by two primary means. An Arrhenius , or kinetic rate,    R    K  _   i  ′    ,  k      subscript  R     K  normal-_   superscript  i  normal-′    k     R_{K\_i^{\prime},k}   , for species    i  ′     superscript  i  normal-′    i^{\prime}   in reaction   k   k   k   , is governed by the local mean species concentrations and temperature in the following way:       R    K  _   i  ′    ,  k    =   -    ν    i  ′   ,  k     M  i    A  k    T   β  k     exp   (   -    E  k    R  T     )      ∏    j  ′   =  1   N     [   C   j  ′    ]    η    j  ′   ,  k        =    K    i  ′   ,  k     M   i  ′      ∏    j  ′   =  1   N     [   C   j  ′    ]    η    j  ′   ,  k              subscript  R     K  normal-_   superscript  i  normal-′    k         subscript  ν    superscript  i  normal-′   k     subscript  M  i    subscript  A  k    superscript  T   subscript  β  k           subscript  E  k     R  T        superscript   subscript  product     superscript  j  normal-′   1    N    superscript   delimited-[]   subscript  C   superscript  j  normal-′      subscript  η    superscript  j  normal-′   k                subscript  K    superscript  i  normal-′   k     subscript  M   superscript  i  normal-′      superscript   subscript  product     superscript  j  normal-′   1    N    superscript   delimited-[]   subscript  C   superscript  j  normal-′      subscript  η    superscript  j  normal-′   k          R_{K\_i^{\prime},k}=-\nu_{i^{\prime},k}M_{i}A_{k}T^{\beta_{k}}\exp{\left(-%
 \frac{E_{k}}{RT}\right)}\prod_{j^{\prime}=1}^{N}\left[C_{j^{\prime}}\right]^{%
 \eta_{j^{\prime},k}}=K_{i^{\prime},k}M_{i^{\prime}}\prod_{j^{\prime}=1}^{N}%
 \left[C_{j^{\prime}}\right]^{\eta_{j^{\prime},k}}     This expression describes the rate at which species    i  ′     superscript  i  normal-′    i^{\prime}   is consumed in reaction   k   k   k   . The constants    A  k     subscript  A  k    A_{k}   and    E  k     subscript  E  k    E_{k}   , the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor and activation energy, respectively, are adjusted for specific reactions, often as the result of experimental measurements. The stoichiometry for species    i  ′     superscript  i  normal-′    i^{\prime}   in reaction   k   k   k   is represented by the factor    ν    i  ′   ,  k      subscript  ν    superscript  i  normal-′   k     \nu_{i^{\prime},k}   , and is positive or negative, depending upon whether the species serves as a product or reactant. The molecular weight of the species    i  ′     superscript  i  normal-′    i^{\prime}   appears as the factor    M   i  ′      subscript  M   superscript  i  normal-′     M_{i^{\prime}}   . The temperature,   T   T   T   , appears in the exponential term and also as a factor in the rate expression, with an optional exponent,    β  k     subscript  β  k    \beta_{k}   . Concentrations of other species,    j  ′     superscript  j  normal-′    j^{\prime}   , involved in the reaction,    [   C   j  ′    ]     delimited-[]   subscript  C   superscript  j  normal-′      \left[C_{j^{\prime}}\right]   , appear as factors with optional exponents associated with each. Other factors and terms not appearing in the equation, can be added to include effects such as the presence of non-reacting species in the rate equation. Such so-called third-body reactions are typical of the effect of a catalyst on a reaction, for example. Many of the factors are often collected into a single rate constant,    K    i  ′   ,  k      subscript  K    superscript  i  normal-′   k     K_{i^{\prime},k}   .  References  Magnussen, B.
