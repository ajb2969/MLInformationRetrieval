   Nilpotent      Nilpotent   In mathematics , an element, x , of a ring , R , is called nilpotent if there exists some positive integer , n , such that x n = 0.  The term was introduced by Benjamin Peirce in the context of his work on the classification of algebras. 1  Examples   This definition can be applied in particular to square matrices . The matrix     A = \begin{pmatrix}     0 & 1 & 0\\  0 & 0 & 1\\  0 & 0 & 0  \end{pmatrix}    is nilpotent because A 3 = 0. See nilpotent matrix for more.    In the factor ring  Z /9 Z , the equivalence class of 3 is nilpotent because 3 2 is congruent to 0 modulo 9.    Assume that two elements a , b in a (non-commutative) ring R satisfy ab = 0. Then the element c = ba is nilpotent (if non-zero) as c 2 = ( ba ) 2 = b ( ab ) a = 0. An example with matrices (for a , b ):     A = \begin{pmatrix}     0 & 1\\  0 & 1  \end{pmatrix}, \;\;  B =\begin{pmatrix}  0 & 1\\  0 & 0  \end{pmatrix}.    Here AB = 0, BA = B .    The ring of coquaternions contains a cone of nilpotents.   Properties  No nilpotent element can be a unit (except in the trivial ring {0}, which has only a single element ). All non-zero nilpotent elements are zero divisors .  An n -by- n matrix A with entries from a field is nilpotent if and only if its characteristic polynomial is t n .  If x is nilpotent, then 1 − x is a unit , because x n = 0 entails        (   1  -  x   )    (   1  +  x  +   x  2   +  ⋯  +   x   n  -  1     )    =   1  -   x  n    =  1.            1  x     1  x   superscript  x  2   normal-⋯   superscript  x    n  1        1   superscript  x  n         1.     (1-x)(1+x+x^{2}+\cdots+x^{n-1})=1-x^{n}=1.     More generally, the sum of a unit element and a nilpotent element is a unit when they commute.  Commutative rings  The nilpotent elements from a commutative ring    R   R   R   form an ideal    𝔑   𝔑   \mathfrak{N}   ; this is a consequence of the binomial theorem . This ideal is the nilradical of the ring. Every nilpotent element   x   x   x   in a commutative ring is contained in every prime ideal    𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   of that ring, since     x  n   =  0  ∈  𝔭         superscript  x  n   0       𝔭     x^{n}=0\in\mathfrak{p}   . So   𝔑   𝔑   \mathfrak{N}   is contained in the intersection of all prime ideals.  If   x   x   x   is not nilpotent, we are able to localize with respect to the powers of   x   x   x       S  =   {  1  ,  x  ,   x  2   ,  …  }       S   1  x   superscript  x  2   normal-…     S=\{1,x,x^{2},...\}   to get a non-zero ring     S   -  1    R       superscript  S    1    R    S^{-1}R   . The prime ideals of the localized ring correspond exactly to those primes   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   with     𝔭  ∩  S   =         𝔭  S   absent    \mathfrak{p}\cap S=   . 2 As every non-zero commutative ring has a maximal ideal, which is prime, every non-nilpotent   x   x   x   is not contained in some prime ideal. Thus   𝔑   𝔑   \mathfrak{N}   is exactly the intersection of all prime ideals. 3  A characteristic similar to that of Jacobson radical and annihilation of simple modules is available for nilradical: nilpotent elements of ring R are precisely those that annihilate all integral domains internal to the ring R (that is, of the form R / I for prime ideals I ). This follows from the fact that nilradical is the intersection of all prime ideals.  Nilpotent elements in Lie algebra  Let   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   be a Lie algebra. Then an element of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is called nilpotent if it is in    [  𝔤  ,  𝔤  ]     𝔤  𝔤    [\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]   and    ad  x     ad  x    \operatorname{ad}x   is a nilpotent transformation.

Grassmann numbers which allow a path integral representation for Fermionic fields are nilpotents since their squares vanish. The BRST charge is an important example in physics .  As linear operators form an associative algebra and thus a ring, this is a special case of the initial definition. 4 5 More generally, in view of the above definitions, an operator Q is nilpotent if there is n ∈ N such that Q n = 0 (the zero function ). Thus, a linear map is nilpotent iff it has a nilpotent matrix in some basis. Another example for this is the exterior derivative (again with n = 2). Both are linked, also through supersymmetry and Morse theory , 6 as shown by Edward Witten in a celebrated article. 7  The electromagnetic field of a plane wave without sources is nilpotent when it is expressed in terms of the algebra of physical space . 8  Algebraic nilpotents  The two-dimensional dual numbers contain a nilpotent space. Other algebras and numbers that contain nilpotent spaces include split-quaternions (coquaternions), split-octonions , biquaternions     ℂ  ⊗  ℍ     tensor-product  ℂ  ℍ    \mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}   , and complex octonions     ℂ  ⊗  𝕆     tensor-product  ℂ  𝕆    \mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{O}   .
