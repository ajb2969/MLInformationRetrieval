Nilpotent

In mathematics, an element, x, of a ring, R, is called nilpotent if there exists some positive integer, n, such that xn = 0.
The term was introduced by Benjamin Peirce in the context of his work on the classification of algebras.1
Examples

This definition can be applied in particular to square matrices. The matrix







   0 & 1 & 0\\
   0 & 0 & 1\\
   0 & 0 & 0
 \end{pmatrix}


is nilpotent because A3 = 0. See nilpotent matrix for more.
 


In the factor ring Z/9Z, the equivalence class of 3 is nilpotent because 32 is congruent to 0 modulo 9.


Assume that two elements a, b in a (non-commutative) ring R satisfy ab = 0. Then the element c = ba is nilpotent (if non-zero) as c2 = (ba)2 = b(ab)a = 0. An example with matrices (for a, b):







   0 & 1\\
   0 & 1
 \end{pmatrix}, \;\;
 B =\begin{pmatrix}
   0 & 1\\
   0 & 0
 \end{pmatrix}.


Here AB = 0, BA = B.
 


The ring of coquaternions contains a cone of nilpotents.

Properties
No nilpotent element can be a unit (except in the trivial ring {0}, which has only a single element ). All non-zero nilpotent elements are zero divisors.
An n-by-n matrix A with entries from a field is nilpotent if and only if its characteristic polynomial is tn.
If x is nilpotent, then 1 − x is a unit, because xn = 0 entails



More generally, the sum of a unit element and a nilpotent element is a unit when they commute.
Commutative rings
The nilpotent elements from a commutative ring

 
  form an ideal

 
 ; this is a consequence of the binomial theorem. This ideal is the nilradical of the ring. Every nilpotent element 
 
 
 
  in a commutative ring is contained in every prime ideal

 
  of that ring, since 
 
 
 
 . So 
 
 
 
  is contained in the intersection of all prime ideals.
If 
 
 
 
  is not nilpotent, we are able to localize with respect to the powers of 
 
 

 
  to get a non-zero ring 
 
 
 
 . The prime ideals of the localized ring correspond exactly to those primes 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .2 As every non-zero commutative ring has a maximal ideal, which is prime, every non-nilpotent 
 
 
 
  is not contained in some prime ideal. Thus 
 
 
 
  is exactly the intersection of all prime ideals.3
A characteristic similar to that of Jacobson radical and annihilation of simple modules is available for nilradical: nilpotent elements of ring R are precisely those that annihilate all integral domains internal to the ring R (that is, of the form R/I for prime ideals I). This follows from the fact that nilradical is the intersection of all prime ideals.
Nilpotent elements in Lie algebra
Let 
 
 
 
  be a Lie algebra. Then an element of 
 
 
 
  is called nilpotent if it is in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a nilpotent transformation. See also: Jordan decomposition in a Lie algebra.
Nilpotency in physics
An operand Q that satisfies Q2 = 0 is nilpotent. Grassmann numbers which allow a path integral representation for Fermionic fields are nilpotents since their squares vanish. The BRST charge is an important example in physics.
As linear operators form an associative algebra and thus a ring, this is a special case of the initial definition.45 More generally, in view of the above definitions, an operator Q is nilpotent if there is n∈N such that Qn = 0 (the zero function). Thus, a linear map is nilpotent iff it has a nilpotent matrix in some basis. Another example for this is the exterior derivative (again with n = 2). Both are linked, also through supersymmetry and Morse theory,6 as shown by Edward Witten in a celebrated article.7
The electromagnetic field of a plane wave without sources is nilpotent when it is expressed in terms of the algebra of physical space.8
Algebraic nilpotents
The two-dimensional dual numbers contain a nilpotent space. Other algebras and numbers that contain nilpotent spaces include split-quaternions (coquaternions), split-octonions, biquaternions

 
 , and complex octonions

 
 .
