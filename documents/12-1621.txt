Papyrus 111 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designated by 
 
 
111, is a copy of the New Testament in Greek. It is a papyrus manuscript of the Gospel of Luke, containing verses 17:11-13 & 17:22-23 in a fragmentary condition. The manuscript has been paleographically assigned by the INTF to the 3rd Century CE. Papyrologist Philip Comfort dates the manuscript to the first half of the 3rd century CE.1 The manuscript is currently housed at the Sackler Library (Papyrology Rooms, P. Oxy. 4495) at Oxford.2

75. The handwriting script is representative of the Documentary style.3
The manuscript has only one nomen sacrum extant:
