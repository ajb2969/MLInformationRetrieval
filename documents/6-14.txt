Carreau fluid

Carreau fluid is a type of generalized Newtonian fluid where viscosity, 
 
 
 
 , depends upon the shear rate, 
 
 
 
 , by the following equation:



Where
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are material coefficients.


 
  = viscosity at zero shear rate (Pa.s)


 
  = viscosity at infinite shear rate (Pa.s)


 
  = relaxation time (s)


 
  = power index
At low shear rate (
 
 
 
 ) Carreau fluid behaves as a Newtonian fluid and at high shear rate (
 
 
 
 ) as a power-law fluid.
The model was first proposed by Pierre Carreau.
