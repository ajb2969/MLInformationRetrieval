GDP-L-fucose synthase

In enzymology, a GDP-L-fucose synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

GDP-L-fucose + NADP+

 
  GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose + NADPH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GDP-L-fucose and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GDP-L-fucose:NADP+ 4-oxidoreductase (3,5-epimerizing). This enzyme is also called GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose-3,5-epimerase-4-reductase. This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism.
