   Operator system      Operator system   Given a unital  C*-algebra    𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   , a *-closed  subspace  S containing 1 is called an operator system . One can associate to each subspace    ℳ  ⊆  𝒜      ℳ  𝒜    \mathcal{M}\subseteq\mathcal{A}   of a unital C*-algebra an operator system via    S  :=   ℳ  +   ℳ  *   +   ℂ  1       assign  S    ℳ   superscript  ℳ      ℂ  1      S:=\mathcal{M}+\mathcal{M}^{*}+\mathbb{C}1   .  The appropriate morphisms between operator systems are completely positive maps .  By a theorem of Choi and Effros, operator systems can be characterized as *-vector spaces equipped with an Archimedean matrix order. 1  References  "  Category:Operator theory  Category:Operator algebras     Choi M.D., Effros, E.G.
