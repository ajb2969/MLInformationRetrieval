Operator system

Given a unital C*-algebra

 
 , a *-closed subspace S containing 1 is called an operator system. One can associate to each subspace 
 
 
 
  of a unital C*-algebra an operator system via 
 
 
 
 .
The appropriate morphisms between operator systems are completely positive maps.
By a theorem of Choi and Effros, operator systems can be characterized as *-vector spaces equipped with an Archimedean matrix order.1
