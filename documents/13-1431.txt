   Paranematic susceptibility      Paranematic susceptibility   In the study of liquid crystals the paranematic susceptibility (Latin: susceptibilis ‚Äúreceptiveness‚Äù) is a quantity that describes the degree of induced order in a liquid crystal in response to an applied magnetic field. As a result of the diamagnetic anisotropy of liquid crystal molecules, nematic order can be produced by the application of a magnetic field. If a magnetic field is applied to a nematic liquid crystal in the isotropic phase then the order is given by:       ‚ü®   P  2   ‚ü©   =   Œ∑   ùêá  2         delimited-‚ü®‚ü©   subscript  P  2      Œ∑   superscript  ùêá  2      \langle P_{2}\rangle=\eta\mathbf{H}^{2}   The proportionality constant   Œ∑   Œ∑   \eta   is the paranematic susceptibility. The value increases as the liquid crystal is cooled towards its transition temperature. In both the mean field approximation and Landau-deGennes theory the paranematic susceptibility is proportional to     (   T  -   T  C  *    )    -  1      superscript    T   subscript   superscript  T    C      1     (T-T^{*}_{C})^{-1}   where    T  C  *     subscript   superscript  T    C    T^{*}_{C}   is the transition temperature.
