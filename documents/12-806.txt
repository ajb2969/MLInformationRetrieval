   Essential range      Essential range   In mathematics , particularly measure theory , the essential range of a function is intuitively the 'non-negligible' range of the function: It does not change between two functions that are equal almost everywhere . One way of thinking of the essential range of a function is the set on which the range of the function is most 'concentrated'. The essential range can be defined for measurable real or complex-valued functions on a measure space .  Formal definition  Let f be a Borel-measurable , complex-valued function defined on a measure space     (  X  ,  ùîÑ  ,  Œº  )     X  ùîÑ  Œº    (X,\mathfrak{A},\mu)   . Then the essential range of f is defined to be the set:        ess  .  im    (  f  )    =   {   z  ‚àà   ‚ÑÇ   ‚à£    for all   Œµ   >   0    :    Œº   (   {  x  :    |    f   (  x  )    -  z   |   <  Œµ   }   )    >  0   }         formulae-sequence  ess  im   f    conditional-set    z    ‚ÑÇ   ket    for all  Œµ    0        Œº   conditional-set  x          f  x   z    Œµ     0      \operatorname{ess.im}(f)=\left\{z\in\mathbb{C}\mid\text{for all}\ \varepsilon>%
 0:\mu(\{x:|f(x)-z|<\varepsilon\})>0\right\}     In other words: The essential range of a complex-valued function is the set of all complex numbers z such that the inverse image of each Œµ-neighbourhood of z under f has positive measure.  Properties   The essential range of a measurable function is always closed.  The essential range ess.im(f) of a measurable function is always a subset of     im   (  f  )    ¬Ø     normal-¬Ø   im  f     \overline{\operatorname{im}(f)}   .  The essential image cannot be used to distinguished functions that are almost everywhere equal: If    f  =  g      f  g    f=g   holds   Œº   Œº   \mu   - almost everywhere , then      ess  .  im    (  f  )    =    ess  .  im    (  g  )          formulae-sequence  ess  im   f     formulae-sequence  ess  im   g     \operatorname{ess.im}(f)=\operatorname{ess.im}(g)   .  These two facts characterise the essential image: It is the biggest set contained in the closures of    im   (  g  )      im  g    \operatorname{im}(g)   for all g that are a.e. equal to f:           ess  .  im    (  f  )    =    ‚ãÇ   f  =    g   a.e.       im   (  g  )    ¬Ø          formulae-sequence  ess  im   f     subscript     f    g  a.e.      normal-¬Ø   im  g       \operatorname{ess.im}(f)=\bigcap_{f=g\,\text{a.e.}}\overline{\operatorname{im}%
 (g)}   .      The essential range satisfies      ‚àÄ  A   ‚äÜ  X   :     f   (  A  )    ‚à©    ess  .  im    (  f  )     =  ‚àÖ  ‚üπ   Œº   (  A  )    =  0      normal-:     for-all  A   X           f  A     formulae-sequence  ess  im   f            Œº  A        0      \forall A\subseteq X:f(A)\cap\operatorname{ess.im}(f)=\emptyset\implies\mu(A)=0   .  This fact characterises the essential image: It is the smallest closed subset of   ‚ÑÇ   ‚ÑÇ   \mathbb{C}   with this property.  The essential supremum of a real valued function equals the supremum of its essential image and the essential infimum equals the infimum of its essential range. Consequently a function is essentially bounded if and only if its essential range is bounded.  The essential range of an essentially bounded function f is equal to the spectrum     œÉ   (  f  )       œÉ  f    \sigma(f)   where f is considered as an element of the C*-algebra      L  ‚àû    (  Œº  )        superscript  L    Œº    L^{\infty}(\mu)   .   Examples   If   Œº   Œº   \mu   is the zero measure, then the essential image of all measurable functions is empty.  This also illustrates that even though the essential range of a function is a subset of the closure of the range of that function, equality of the two sets need not hold.  If    X  ‚äÜ   ‚Ñù  n       X   superscript  ‚Ñù  n     X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}   is open,    f  :   X  ‚Üí  ‚ÑÇ      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  X  ‚ÑÇ     f:X\to\mathbb{C}   and   Œº   Œº   \mu   the Lebesgue measure, then      ess  .  im    (  f  )    =    im   (  f  )    ¬Ø         formulae-sequence  ess  im   f    normal-¬Ø   im  f      \operatorname{ess.im}(f)=\overline{\operatorname{im}(f)}   holds. This holds more generally for all Borel measures that assign non-zero measure to every non-empty open set.
