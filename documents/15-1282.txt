Pairwise error probability

Pairwise error probability is the error probability that for a transmitted signal (
 
 
 
 ) its corresponding but distorted version (
 
 
 
 ) will be received. This type of probability is called ″pair-wise error probability″ because the probability exists with a pair of signal vectors in a signal constellation.1 It's mainly used in communication systems.2
Expansion of the definition
In general, the received signal is a distorted version of the transmitted signal. Thus, we introduce the symbol error probability, which is the probability 
 
 
 
  that the demodulator will make a wrong estimation 
 
 
 
  of the transmitted symbol 
 
 
 
  based on the received symbol, which is defined as follows:



where 
 
 
 
  is the size of signal constellation.
The pairwise error probability 
 
 
 
  is defined as the probability that, when 
 
 
 
  is transmitted, 
 
 
 
  is received.


 
  can be expressed as the probability that at least one 
 
 
 
  is closer than 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .
Using the upper bound to the probability of a union of events, it can be written:



Finally:



Closed form computation
For the simple case of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel:



The PEP can be computed in closed form as follows:



 
  is a Gaussian random variable with mean 0 and variance

 
 .
For a zero mean, variance 
 
 
 
  Gaussian random variable:
