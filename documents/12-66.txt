Haagerup property

In mathematics, the Haagerup property, named after Uffe Haagerup and also known as Gromov's a-T-menability, is a property of groups that is a strong negation of Kazhdan's property (T). Property (T) is considered a representation-theoretic form of rigidity, so the Haagerup property may be considered a form of strong nonrigidity; see below for details.
The Haagerup property is interesting to many fields of mathematics, including harmonic analysis, representation theory, operator K-theory, and geometric group theory.
Perhaps its most impressive consequence is that groups with the Haagerup Property satisfy the Baumâ€“Connes conjecture and the related Novikov conjecture. Groups with the Haagerup property are also uniformly embeddable into a Hilbert space.
Definitions
Let 
 
 
 
  be a second countable locally compact group. The following properties are all equivalent, and any of them may be taken to be definitions of the Haagerup property:

There is a proper continuous conditionally negative definite function

 
 .


 
  has the Haagerup approximation property, also known as Property 
 
 
: there is a sequence of normalized continuous positive-definite functions

 
  which vanish at infinity on 
 
 
 
  and converge to 1 uniformly on compact subsets of 
 
 
 
 .
There is a strongly continuous unitary representation of 
 
 
 
  which weakly contains the trivial representation and whose matrix coefficients vanish at infinity on 
 
 
 
 .
There is a proper continuous affine isometric action of 
 
 
 
  on a Hilbert space.

Examples
There are many examples of groups with the Haagerup property, most of which are geometric in origin. The list includes:

All compact groups (trivially). Note all compact groups also have property (T). The converse holds as well: if a group has both property (T) and the Haagerup property, then it is compact.
