Chudnovsky algorithm

The Chudnovsky algorithm is a fast method for calculating the digits of π. It was published by the Chudnovsky brothers in 1989,1 and was used in the world record calculations of 2.7 trillion digits of π in December 2009,2 5 trillion digits of π in August 2010,3 10 trillion digits of π in October 2011,45 and 12.1 trillion digits in December 2013.6
The algorithm is based on the negated Heegner number

 
 , the j-function

 
 , and on the following rapidly convergent generalized hypergeometric series:7



Note that 545140134 = 163 x 3344418 and,



This identity is similar to some of Ramanujan's formulas involving π,8 and is an example of a Ramanujan–Sato series.
