   Chudnovsky algorithm      Chudnovsky algorithm   The Chudnovsky algorithm is a fast method for calculating the digits of π . It was published by the Chudnovsky brothers in 1989, 1 and was used in the world record calculations of 2.7 trillion digits of π in December 2009, 2 5 trillion digits of π in August 2010, 3 10 trillion digits of π in October 2011, 4 5 and 12.1 trillion digits in December 2013. 6  The algorithm is based on the negated Heegner number     d  =   -  163       d    163     d=-163   , the j-function      j   (    1  +    -  163     2   )    =   -   640320  3          j      1      163     2       superscript  640320  3      j\big(\tfrac{1+\sqrt{-163}}{2}\big)=-640320^{3}   , and on the following rapidly convergent generalized hypergeometric series : 7        1  π   =   12    ∑   k  =  0   ∞       (   -  1   )   k     (   6  k   )   !    (    545140134  k   +  13591409   )       (   3  k   )   !     (   k  !   )   3     (   640320  3   )    k  +   1  /  2          .        1  π     12    subscript   superscript       k  0         superscript    1   k       6  k        545140134  k   13591409          3  k     superscript    k   3    superscript   superscript  640320  3     k    1  2           \frac{1}{\pi}=12\sum^{\infty}_{k=0}\frac{(-1)^{k}(6k)!(545140134k+13591409)}{(%
 3k)!(k!)^{3}(640320^{3})^{k+1/2}}.\!     Note that 545140134 = 163 x 3344418 and,       e   π   163     ≈    640320  3   +   743.99999999999925  …         superscript  e    π    163        superscript  640320  3     743.99999999999925  normal-…      e^{\pi\sqrt{163}}\approx 640320^{3}+743.99999999999925\dots     This identity is similar to some of Ramanujan 's formulas involving π, 8 and is an example of a Ramanujan–Sato series .
