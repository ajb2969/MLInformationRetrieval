Holo-ACP synthase




Holo-ACP synthase

In enzymology, a holo-ACP synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2'-(5"-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA + apo-citrate lyase 
 
 
 
  holo-citrate lyase + diphosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2'-(5''-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA and apo-citrate lyase, whereas its two products are holo-citrate lyase and diphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is '2'-(5-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA:apo-citrate lyase adenylyltransferase'''. Other names in common use include 2'-(5"-phosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA transferase, 2'-(5"-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA:apo-citrate lyase, and CitX. This enzyme participates in two-component system - general.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
