   Neighborhood semantics      Neighborhood semantics   Neighborhood semantics , also known as Scott-Montague semantics , is a formal semantics for modal logics. It is a generalization, developed independently by Dana Scott and Richard Montague , of the more widely known relational semantics for modal logic. Whereas a relational frame     ⟨  W  ,  R  ⟩     W  R    \langle W,R\rangle   consists of a set W of worlds (or states) and an accessibility relation  R intended to indicate which worlds are alternatives to (or, accessible from) others, a neighborhood frame     ⟨  W  ,  N  ⟩     W  N    \langle W,N\rangle   still has a set W of worlds, but has instead of an accessibility relation a neighborhood function      N  :   W  →   2   2  W        normal-:  N   normal-→  W   superscript  2   superscript  2  W       N:W\to 2^{2^{W}}     that assigns to each element of W a set of subsets of W . Intuitively, each family of subsets assigned to a world are the propositions necessary at that world, where 'proposition' is defined as a subset of W (i.e. the set of worlds at which the proposition is true). Specifically, if M is a model on the frame, then         M  ,  w   ⊧   □  A    ⟺     (  A  )   M   ∈   N   (  w  )      ,     normal-⟺   models   M  w     normal-□  A       superscript  A  M     N  w      M,w\models\square A\Longleftrightarrow(A)^{M}\in N(w),     where        (  A  )   M   =   {   u  ∈  W   ∣    M  ,  u   ⊧  A   }        superscript  A  M    conditional-set    u  W    models   M  u   A      (A)^{M}=\{u\in W\mid M,u\models A\}     is the truth set of A .  Neighborhood semantics is used for the classical modal logics that are strictly weaker than the normal modal logic  K .  Correspondence between relational and neighborhood models  To every relational model M = (W,R,V) there corresponds an equivalent (in the sense of having point-wise equivalent modal theories) neighborhood model M' = (W,N,V) defined by        N   (  w  )    =   {    (  A  )   M   :    M  ,  w   ⊧   □  A    }    .        N  w    conditional-set   superscript  A  M    models   M  w     normal-□  A       N(w)=\{(A)^{M}:M,w\models\Box A\}.     The fact that the converse fails gives a precise sense to the remark that neighborhood models are a generalization of relational ones. Another (perhaps more natural) generalization of relational structures are general relational structures .  References   Scott, D. "Advice in modal logic", in Philosophical Problems in Logic , ed.
