Absolutely convex set

A set C in a real or complex vector space is said to be absolutely convex if it is convex and balanced.
Properties
A set 
 
 
 
  is absolutely convex if and only if for any points 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and any numbers 
 
 
 
 
  satisfying 
 
 
 
  the sum 
 
 
 
  belongs to 
 
 
 
 .
Since the intersection of any collection of absolutely convex sets is absolutely convex then for any subset A of a vector space one can define its absolutely convex hull to be the intersection of all absolutely convex sets containing A.
Absolutely convex hull
 The absolutely convex hull of the set A assumes the following representation
