   Absolutely convex set      Absolutely convex set   A set  C in a real or complex  vector space is said to be absolutely convex if it is convex and balanced .  Properties  A set   C   C   C   is absolutely convex if and only if for any points     x  1   ,   x  2       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2     x_{1},\,x_{2}   in   C   C   C   and any numbers     Œª  1   ,   Œª  2       subscript  Œª  1    subscript  Œª  2     \lambda_{1},\,\lambda_{2}   satisfying      |   Œª  1   |   +   |   Œª  2   |    ‚â§  1           subscript  Œª  1       subscript  Œª  2     1    |\lambda_{1}|+|\lambda_{2}|\leq 1   the sum      Œª  1    x  1    +    Œª  2    x  2           subscript  Œª  1    subscript  x  1       subscript  Œª  2    subscript  x  2      \lambda_{1}x_{1}+\lambda_{2}x_{2}   belongs to   C   C   C   .  Since the intersection of any collection of absolutely convex sets is absolutely convex then for any subset A of a vector space one can define its absolutely convex hull to be the intersection of all absolutely convex sets containing A .  Absolutely convex hull  The absolutely convex hull of the set A assumes the following representation       absconv  A   =   {    ‚àë   i  =  1   n     Œª  i    x  i     :    n  ‚àà  ùí©   ,     x  i   ‚àà  A   ,     ‚àë   i  =  1   n    |   Œª  i   |    ‚â§  1     }         absconv  A    conditional-set    superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  Œª  i    subscript  x  i      formulae-sequence    n  ùí©    formulae-sequence     subscript  x  i   A       superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  Œª  i     1        \mbox{absconv}A=\left\{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}x_{i}:n\in\mathcal{N},\,x_{i}%
