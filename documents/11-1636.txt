   UDP-N-acetylglucosamine diphosphorylase      UDP-N-acetylglucosamine diphosphorylase   In enzymology , an UDP-N-acetylglucosamine diphosphorylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UTP + N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UTP and[N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate, whereas its two products are diphosphate and UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is UTP:N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase . Other names in common use include UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase , uridine diphosphoacetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase , UTP:2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate , uridylyltransferase , UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase , GlmU uridylyltransferase , Acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase , UDP-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase , uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase , uridine diphosphoacetylglucosamine phosphorylase , and acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase . This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism .
