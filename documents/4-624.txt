   Dehn twist      Dehn twist   (Figure)  A positive Dehn twist applied to a cylinder about the red curve c modifies the green curve as shown.   In geometric topology , a branch of mathematics , a Dehn twist is a certain type of self-homeomorphism of a surface (two-dimensional manifold ).  Definition  (Figure)  General Dehn twist on a compact surface represented by a n-gon.   Suppose that c is a simple closed curve in a closed, orientable surface S . Let A be a tubular neighborhood of c . Then A is an annulus and so is homeomorphic to the Cartesian product of        S  1   √ó  I   ,       superscript  S  1   I    S^{1}\times I,     where I is the unit interval . Give A coordinates ( s , t ) where s is a complex number of the form      e   i  Œ∏      superscript  e    normal-i  Œ∏     e^{{\rm{i}}\theta}     with       Œ∏  ‚àà   [  0  ,   2  œÄ   ]    ,      Œ∏   0    2  œÄ      \theta\in[0,2\pi],     and t in the unit interval.  Let f be the map from S to itself which is the identity outside of A and inside A we have        f   (  s  ,  t  )    =   (   s   e   i2  œÄ  t     ,  t  )    .        f   s  t       s   superscript  e    i2  œÄ  t     t     \displaystyle f(s,t)=(se^{{\rm{i}}2\pi t},t).     Then f is a Dehn twist about the curve c .  Dehn twists can also be defined on a non-orientable surface S , provided one starts with a 2-sided simple closed curve c on S .  Example  thumb|upright=1.5|An example of a Dehn twist on the torus, along the closed curve a , in blue, where a is an edge of the fundamental polygon representing the torus  thumb|upright=1.5|The automorphism on the fundamental group of the torus induced by the self-homeomorphism of the Dehn twist along one of the generators of the torus  Consider the torus represented by a fundamental polygon with edges a and b        ùïã  2   ‚âÖ    ‚Ñù  2   /   ‚Ñ§  2     .       superscript  ùïã  2      superscript  ‚Ñù  2    superscript  ‚Ñ§  2      \mathbb{T}^{2}\cong\mathbb{R}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}^{2}.     Let a closed curve be the line along the edge a called    Œ≥  a     subscript  Œ≥  a    \gamma_{a}   .  Given the choice of gluing homeomorphism in the figure, a tubular neighborhood of the curve    Œ≥  a     subscript  Œ≥  a    \gamma_{a}   will look like a band linked around a doughnut. This neighborhood is homeomorphic to an annulus , say       a   (  0  ;  0  ,  1  )    =   {   z  ‚àà  ‚ÑÇ   :   0  <   |  z  |   <  1   }         a   0  0  1     conditional-set    z  ‚ÑÇ       0    z        1       a(0;0,1)=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:0<|z|<1\}   in the complex plane.  By extending to the torus the twisting map     (   e   i  Œ∏    ,  t  )   ‚Ü¶   (   e   i   (   Œ∏  +   2  œÄ  t    )     ,  t  )      maps-to    superscript  e    i  Œ∏    t     superscript  e    i    Œ∏    2  œÄ  t      t     (e^{i\theta},t)\mapsto(e^{i(\theta+2\pi t)},t)   of the annulus, through the homeomorphisms of the annulus to an open cylinder to the neighborhood of    Œ≥  a     subscript  Œ≥  a    \gamma_{a}   , yields a Dehn twist of the torus by a .       T  a   :    ùïã  2   ‚Üí   ùïã  2       normal-:   subscript  T  a    normal-‚Üí   superscript  ùïã  2    superscript  ùïã  2      T_{a}:\mathbb{T}^{2}\to\mathbb{T}^{2}     This self homeomorphism acts on the closed curve along b . In the tubular neighborhood it takes the curve of b once along the curve of a .  A homeomorphism between topological spaces induces a natural isomorphism between their fundamental groups . Therefore one has an automorphism       T  a   ‚àó    :     œÄ  1    (   ùïã  2   )    ‚Üí    œÄ  1    (   ùïã  2   )     :    [  x  ]   ‚Ü¶   [    T  a    (  x  )    ]         normal-:   subscript   subscript  T  a   normal-‚àó    normal-‚Üí     subscript  œÄ  1    superscript  ùïã  2       subscript  œÄ  1    superscript  ùïã  2       normal-:     maps-to   delimited-[]  x    delimited-[]     subscript  T  a   x        {T_{a}}_{\ast}:\pi_{1}(\mathbb{T}^{2})\to\pi_{1}(\mathbb{T}^{2}):[x]\mapsto[T_%
 {a}(x)]     where [ x ] are the homotopy classes of the closed curve x in the torus. Notice      T  a   ‚àó     (   [  a  ]   )    =   [  a  ]          subscript   subscript  T  a   normal-‚àó    delimited-[]  a     delimited-[]  a     {T_{a}}_{\ast}([a])=[a]   and      T  a   ‚àó     (   [  b  ]   )    =   [   b  *  a   ]          subscript   subscript  T  a   normal-‚àó    delimited-[]  b     delimited-[]    b  a      {T_{a}}_{\ast}([b])=[b*a]   , where    b  *  a      b  a    b*a   is the path travelled around b then a .  Mapping class group  It is a theorem of Max Dehn that maps of this form generate the mapping class group of isotopy classes of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of any closed, oriented genus -   g   g   g   surface. W. B. R. Lickorish later rediscovered this result with a simpler proof and in addition showed that Dehn twists along     3  g   -  1        3  g   1    3g-1   explicit curves generate the mapping class group (this is called by the punning name " Lickorish twist theorem"); this number was later improved by Stephen P. Humphries to     2  g   +  1        2  g   1    2g+1   , for    g  >  1      g  1    g>1   , which he showed was the minimal number.  Lickorish also obtained an analogous result for non-orientable surfaces, which require not only Dehn twists, but also " Y-homeomorphisms ."  See also   Lantern relation   References   Andrew J.
