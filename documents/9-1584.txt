Colinear map

In coalgebra theory, the notion of colinear map is dual to the notion for linear map of vector space, or more generally, for morphism between R-module. Specifically, let R be a ring, M,N,C be R-modules, and



be right C-comodules. Then an R-linear map 
 
 
 
  is called a (right) comodule morphism, or (right) C-colinear, if
