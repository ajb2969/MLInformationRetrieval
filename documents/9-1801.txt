Dynkin's formula

In mathematics — specifically, in stochastic analysis — Dynkin's formula is a theorem giving the expected value of any suitably smooth statistic of an Itō diffusion at a stopping time. It may be seen as a stochastic generalization of the (second) fundamental theorem of calculus. It is named after the Russian mathematician Eugene Dynkin.
Statement of the theorem
Let X be the Rn-valued Itō diffusion solving the stochastic differential equation



For a point x ∈ Rn, let Px denote the law of X given initial datum X0 = x, and let Ex denote expectation with respect to Px.
Let A be the infinitesimal generator of X, defined by its action on compactly-supported C2 (twice differentiable with continuous second derivative) functions f : Rn → R as



or, equivalently,



Let τ be a stopping time with Ex[τ] 2 with compact support. Then Dynkin's formula holds:



In fact, if τ is the first exit time for a bounded set B ⊂ Rn with Ex[τ] 2 functions f, without the assumption of compact support.
Example
Dynkin's formula can be used to find the expected first exit time τK of Brownian motion B from the closed ball



which, when B starts at a point a in the interior of K, is given by



Choose an integer j. The strategy is to apply Dynkin's formula with X = B, τ = σj = min(j, τK), and a compactly-supported C2 f with f(x) = |x|2 on K. The generator of Brownian motion is Δ/2, where Δ denotes the Laplacian operator. Therefore, by Dynkin's formula,

















Hence, for any j,



Now let j → +∞ to conclude that τK = limj→+∞σj \mathbf{E}^{a} [\tau_{K}] = \frac1{n} \big( R^{2} - | a |^{2} \big),
as claimed.
