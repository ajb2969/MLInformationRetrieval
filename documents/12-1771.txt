   Dunford–Schwartz theorem      Dunford–Schwartz theorem   In mathematics , particularly functional analysis , the Dunford–Schwartz theorem , named after Nelson Dunford and Jacob T. Schwartz states that the averages of powers of certain norm- bounded operators on L 1  converge in a suitable sense. 1  Statement of the theorem       Let  T  be a linear operator from   L  1   to   L  1   with    ∥  T  ∥   1    ≤   1  and    ∥  T  ∥   ∞    ≤   1  . Then           Let  T  be a linear operator from   superscript  L  1   to   superscript  L  1   with   subscript   norm  T   1      1  and   subscript   norm  T             1  . Then      \text{Let }T\text{ be a linear operator from }L^{1}\text{ to }L^{1}\text{ with%
  }\|T\|_{1}\leq 1\text{ and }\|T\|_{\infty}\leq 1\text{. Then}          lim   n  →  ∞      1  n     ∑   k  =  0    n  -  1      T  k   f         subscript    normal-→  n         1  n     superscript   subscript     k  0      n  1       superscript  T  k   f       \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}T^{k}f        exists almost everywhere for all  f   ∈    L  1   .         exists almost everywhere for all  f      superscript  L  1   .     \text{exists almost everywhere for all }f\in L^{1}\text{.}     The statement is no longer true when the boundedness condition is relaxed to even      ∥  T  ∥   ∞   ≤   1  +  ε        subscript   norm  T       1  ε     \|T\|_{\infty}\leq 1+\varepsilon   . 2  Notes  "  Category:Theorems in functional analysis     . ↩  . ↩
