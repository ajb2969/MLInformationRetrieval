   Superellipsoid      Superellipsoid   In mathematics , a super-ellipsoid or superellipsoid is a solid whose horizontal sections are super-ellipses (Lamé curves) with the same exponent  r , and whose vertical sections through the center are super-ellipses with the same exponent t .  Super-ellipsoids as computer graphics primitives were popularized by Alan H. Barr (who used the name "superquadrics" to refer to both superellipsoids and supertoroids ). 1 2 However, while some super-ellipsoids are superquadrics , neither family is contained in the other.  Piet Hein 's supereggs are special cases of super-ellipsoids.  Formulas  Basic shape  The basic super-ellipsoid is defined by the implicit equation         (     |  x  |   r   +    |  y  |   r    )    t  /  r    +    |  z  |   t    ≤  1         superscript     superscript    x   r    superscript    y   r      t  r     superscript    z   t    1    \left(\left|x\right|^{r}+\left|y\right|^{r}\right)^{t/r}+\left|z\right|^{t}\leq
 1   The parameters r and t are positive real numbers that control the amount of flattening at the tips and at the equator. Note that the formula becomes a special case of the superquadric's equation if (and only if) t = r .  Any " parallel of latitude " of the superellipsoid (a horizontal section at any constant z between -1 and +1) is a Lamé curve with exponent r , scaled by    a  =    (   1  -    |  z  |   t    )    1  /  t        a   superscript    1   superscript    z   t      1  t      a=(1-\left|z\right|^{t})^{1/t}   :         |   x  a   |   r   +    |   y  a   |   r    ≤  1         superscript      x  a    r    superscript      y  a    r    1    \left|\frac{x}{a}\right|^{r}+\left|\frac{y}{a}\right|^{r}\leq 1     Any " meridian of longitude " (a section by any vertical plane through the origin) is a Lamé curve with exponent t , stretched horizontally by a factor w that depends on the sectioning plane. Namely, if x = u cos θ and y = u sin θ , for a fixed θ , then         |   u  w   |   t   +    |  z  |   t    ≤  1         superscript      u  w    t    superscript    z   t    1    \left|\frac{u}{w}\right|^{t}+\left|z\right|^{t}\leq 1     where       w  =    (     |   cos  θ   |   r   +    |   sin  θ   |   r    )    -   1  /  r      .      w   superscript     superscript      θ    r    superscript      θ    r        1  r       w=(\left|\cos\theta\right|^{r}+\left|\sin\theta\right|^{r})^{-1/r}.     In particular, if r is 2, the horizontal cross-sections are circles, and the horizontal stretching w of the vertical sections is 1 for all planes. In that case, the super-ellipsoid is a solid of revolution , obtained by rotating the Lamé curve with exponent t around the vertical axis.  The basic shape above extends from −1 to +1 along each coordinate axis. The general super-ellipsoid is obtained by scaling the basic shape along each axis by factors A , B , C , the semi-diameters of the resulting solid. The implicit equation is         (     |   x  A   |   r   +    |   y  B   |   r    )    t  /  r    +    |   z  C   |   t    ≤  1         superscript     superscript      x  A    r    superscript      y  B    r      t  r     superscript      z  C    t    1    \left(\left|\frac{x}{A}\right|^{r}+\left|\frac{y}{B}\right|^{r}\right)^{t/r}+%
 \left|\frac{z}{C}\right|^{t}\leq 1     Setting r = 2, t = 2.5, A = B = 3, C = 4 one obtains Piet Hein's superegg.  The general superellipsoid has a parametric representation in terms of surface parameters -π/2       x   (  u  ,  v  )    =   A  c   (  v  ,   2  t   )   c   (  u  ,   2  r   )          x   u  v      A  c   v    2  t    c   u    2  r       x(u,v)=Ac\left(v,\frac{2}{t}\right)c\left(u,\frac{2}{r}\right)          y   (  u  ,  v  )    =   B  c   (  v  ,   2  t   )   s   (  u  ,   2  r   )          y   u  v      B  c   v    2  t    s   u    2  r       y(u,v)=Bc\left(v,\frac{2}{t}\right)s\left(u,\frac{2}{r}\right)          z   (  u  ,  v  )    =   C  s   (  v  ,   2  t   )          z   u  v      C  s   v    2  t       z(u,v)=Cs\left(v,\frac{2}{t}\right)     where the auxiliary functions are       c   (  ω  ,  m  )    =    sgn   (   cos  ω   )      |   cos  ω   |   m          c   ω  m       sgn    ω     superscript      ω    m      c(\omega,m)=\operatorname{sgn}(\cos\omega)|\cos\omega|^{m}          s   (  ω  ,  m  )    =    sgn   (   sin  ω   )      |   sin  ω   |   m          s   ω  m       sgn    ω     superscript      ω    m      s(\omega,m)=\operatorname{sgn}(\sin\omega)|\sin\omega|^{m}     and the sign function sgn( x ) is       sgn   (  x  )    =   {       -  1   ,      x  <  0        0  ,      x  =  0         +  1   ,      x  >  0.            sgn  x    cases    1     x  0   0    x  0     1     x  0.      \operatorname{sgn}(x)=\begin{cases}-1,&x<0\\
