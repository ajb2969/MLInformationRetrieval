In economics , the single-crossing condition or single-crossing property refers to how the probability distribution of outcomes changes as a function of an input and a parameter.  Cumulative distribution functions  F and G satisfy the single-crossing condition if there exists a y such that        ∀  x   ,  x   ≥  y  ⟹   F   (  x  )    ≥   G   (  y  )            for-all  x   x   y         F  x          G  y      \forall x,x\geq y\implies F(x)\geq G(y)     and        ∀  x   ,  x   ≤  y  ⟹   F   (  x  )    ≤   G   (  y  )            for-all  x   x   y         F  x          G  y      \forall x,x\leq y\implies F(x)\leq G(y)   ;  that is, function     h   (  x  )    =    F   (  x  )    -   G   (  y  )           h  x       F  x     G  y      h(x)=F(x)-G(y)   crosses the x-axis at most once, in which case it does so from below.  This property can be extended to two or more variables. Given x and t, for all x'>x, t'>t,       F   (   x  ′   ,  t  )    ≥   F   (  x  ,  t  )    ⟹   F   (   x  ′   ,   t  ′   )    ≥   F   (  x  ,   t  ′   )            F    superscript  x  normal-′   t      F   x  t           F    superscript  x  normal-′    superscript  t  normal-′            F   x   superscript  t  normal-′        F(x^{\prime},t)\geq F(x,t)\implies F(x^{\prime},t^{\prime})\geq F(x,t^{\prime})     and       F   (   x  ′   ,  t  )    >   F   (  x  ,  t  )    ⟹   F   (   x  ′   ,   t  ′   )    >   F   (  x  ,   t  ′   )            F    superscript  x  normal-′   t      F   x  t           F    superscript  x  normal-′    superscript  t  normal-′            F   x   superscript  t  normal-′        F(x^{\prime},t)>F(x,t)\implies F(x^{\prime},t^{\prime})>F(x,t^{\prime})   .  This condition could be interpreted as saying that for x'>x, the function g(t)=F(x',t)-F(x,t) crosses the horizontal axis at most once, and from below. The condition is not symmetric in the variables (i.e., we cannot switch x and t in the definition; the necessary inequality in the first argument is weak, while the inequality in the second argument is strict).  The single-crossing condition was posited in Samuel Karlin 's 1968 monograph 'Total Positivity'. 1 It was later used by Peter Diamond , Joseph Stiglitz , 2 and Susan Athey , 3 in studying the economics of uncertainty, 4 The single-crossing condition is also used in applications where there are a few agents or types of agents that have preferences over an ordered set . Such situations appear often in information economics , contract theory , social choice and political economics , among other fields.
