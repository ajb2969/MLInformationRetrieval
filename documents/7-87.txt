   Domain of holomorphy      Domain of holomorphy   In mathematics , in the theory of functions of several complex variables , a domain of holomorphy is a set which is maximal in the sense that there exists a holomorphic function on this set which cannot be extended to a bigger set.  Formally, an open set    Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   in the n -dimensional complex space    ℂ  n     superscript  ℂ  n    {\mathbb{C}}^{n}   is called a domain of holomorphy if there do not exist non-empty open sets    U  ⊂  Ω      U  normal-Ω    U\subset\Omega   and    V  ⊂   ℂ  n       V   superscript  ℂ  n     V\subset{\mathbb{C}}^{n}   where   V   V   V   is connected ,    V  ⊄  Ω     not-subset-of  V  normal-Ω    V\not\subset\Omega   and    U  ⊂   Ω  ∩  V       U    normal-Ω  V     U\subset\Omega\cap V   such that for every holomorphic function    f   f   f   on   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   there exists a holomorphic function   g   g   g   on   V   V   V   with    f  =  g      f  g    f=g   on   U   U   U     In the    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   case, every open set is a domain of holomorphy: we can define a holomorphic function with zeros accumulating everywhere on the boundary of the domain, which must then be a natural boundary for a domain of definition of its inverse. For    n  ≥  2      n  2    n\geq 2   this is no longer true, as it follows from Hartogs' lemma .  Equivalent conditions  For a domain   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   the following conditions are equivalent:      Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is a domain of holomorphy     Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is holomorphically convex     Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is pseudoconvex     Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is Levi convex - for every sequence     S  n   ⊆  Ω       subscript  S  n   normal-Ω    S_{n}\subseteq\Omega   of analytic compact surfaces such that      S  n   →  S   ,    ∂   S  n    →  Γ      formulae-sequence   normal-→   subscript  S  n   S    normal-→     subscript  S  n    normal-Γ     S_{n}\rightarrow S,\partial S_{n}\rightarrow\Gamma   for some set   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   we have    S  ⊆  Ω      S  normal-Ω    S\subseteq\Omega   (    ∂  Ω      normal-Ω    \partial\Omega   cannot be "touched from inside" by a sequence of analytic surfaces)     Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   has local Levi property - for every point    x  ∈   ∂  Ω       x    normal-Ω     x\in\partial\Omega   there exist a neighbourhood   U   U   U   of   x   x   x   and   f   f   f   holomorphic on    U  ∩  Ω      U  normal-Ω    U\cap\Omega   such that   f   f   f   cannot be extended to any neighbourhood of   x   x   x      Implications    1  ⇔  2  ,  3  ⇔  4  ,  1  ⇒  4  ,  3  ⇒  5     fragments  1  normal-⇔  2  normal-,  3  normal-⇔  4  normal-,  1  normal-⇒  4  normal-,  3  normal-⇒  5    1\Leftrightarrow 2,3\Leftrightarrow 4,1\Rightarrow 4,3\Rightarrow 5   are standard results (for    1  ⇒  3     normal-⇒  1  3    1\Rightarrow 3   , see Oka's lemma ). The main difficulty lies in proving    5  ⇒  1     normal-⇒  5  1    5\Rightarrow 1   , i.e. constructing a global holomorphic function which admits no extension from non-extendable functions defined only locally. This is called the Levi problem (after E. E. Levi ) and was first solved by Kiyoshi Oka , and then by Lars Hörmander using methods from functional analysis and partial differential equations (a consequence of     ∂  ¯     normal-¯     \bar{\partial}   -problem ).  Properties   If     Ω  1   ,  …  ,   Ω  n       subscript  normal-Ω  1   normal-…   subscript  normal-Ω  n     \Omega_{1},\dots,\Omega_{n}   are domains of holomorphy, then their intersection    Ω  =    ⋂   j  =  1   n    Ω  j        normal-Ω    superscript   subscript     j  1    n    subscript  normal-Ω  j      \Omega=\bigcap_{j=1}^{n}\Omega_{j}   is also a domain of holomorphy.  If     Ω  1   ⊆   Ω  2   ⊆  …         subscript  normal-Ω  1    subscript  normal-Ω  2        normal-…     \Omega_{1}\subseteq\Omega_{2}\subseteq\dots   is an ascending sequence of domains of holomorphy, then their union    Ω  =    ⋃   n  =  1   ∞    Ω  n        normal-Ω    superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  normal-Ω  n      \Omega=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\Omega_{n}   is also a domain of holomorphy (see Behnke-Stein theorem ).  If    Ω  1     subscript  normal-Ω  1    \Omega_{1}   and    Ω  2     subscript  normal-Ω  2    \Omega_{2}   are domains of holomorphy, then     Ω  1   ×   Ω  2        subscript  normal-Ω  1    subscript  normal-Ω  2     \Omega_{1}\times\Omega_{2}   is a domain of holomorphy.  The first Cousin problem is always solvable in a domain of holomorphy; this is also true, with additional topological assumptions, for the second Cousin problem .
