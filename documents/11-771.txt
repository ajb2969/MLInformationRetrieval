   Pantothenase      Pantothenase   In enzymology , a pantothenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-pantothenate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (R)-pantoate + beta-alanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-pantothenate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are (R)-pantoate and beta-alanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-pantothenate amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include pantothenate hydrolase , and pantothenate amidohydrolase . This enzyme participates in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
