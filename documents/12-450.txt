   Standard wire gauge      Standard wire gauge    British Standard Wire Gauge is a set of wire sizes given by BS 3737:1964 (now withdrawn), and is generally abbreviated to SWG. It is also known as: Imperial Wire Gauge or British Standard Gauge . Use of SWG sizes has fallen greatly in popularity, but is still used as a measure of thickness in guitar strings and some electrical wire. Cross sectional area in square millimetres is now a more popular size measurement. The current British Standard for metallic materials such as wire and sheet is BS 6722:1986, which is a solely metric standard.  SWG was fixed by Order of Council August 23, 1883. It was constructed by improving the Birmingham Wire Gauge . It was made legal standard March 1, 1884 by the British Board of Trade .  The basis of the system is the mil , or . No. 7/0, the largest size, is . (500 mils or ) in diameter, and the smallest, No. 50, is . ( or about ) in diameter. Between each gauge, the weight diminishes by approximately 20%. Because the weight per unit length is related to the area, and therefore the square of the diameter, the diameter diminishes by approximately 10.6%:      Diameter Ratio  =   1  -    (   1  -  0.2   )    1  2     ≈   10.6  %         Diameter Ratio    1   superscript    1  0.2     1  2           percent  10.6      \mbox{Diameter Ratio}=1-(1-0.2)^{\frac{1}{2}}\approx 10.6\%      A table of wire gauges and diameters is shown below. 1 2 The relationship of diameter to gauge is piecewise linear, only approximating a (constant-ratio) exponential curve.
