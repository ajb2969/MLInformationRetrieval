   Salicyl-alcohol beta-D-glucosyltransferase      Salicyl-alcohol beta-D-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a salicyl-alcohol beta-D-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + salicyl alcohol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + salicin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and salicyl alcohol , whereas its two products are UDP and salicin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:salicyl-alcohol beta-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-salicyl alcohol 2-glucosyltransferase , and UDPglucose:salicyl alcohol phenyl-glucosyltransferase .
