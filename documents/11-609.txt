   Beta-aspartyl-N-acetylglucosaminidase      Beta-aspartyl-N-acetylglucosaminidase   In enzymology , a beta-aspartyl-N-acetylglucosaminidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1-beta-aspartyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminylamine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-asparagine + N-acetyl-D-glucosamine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-beta-aspartyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminylamine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are L-asparagine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosylases that hydrolyse N-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-beta-aspartyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminylamine L-asparaginohydrolase . This enzyme is also called beta-aspartylacetylglucosaminidase .
