   Bracket polynomial      Bracket polynomial   In the mathematical field of knot theory , the bracket polynomial (also known as the Kauffman bracket ) is a polynomial invariant of framed links . Although it is not an invariant of knots or links (as it is not invariant under type I Reidemeister moves ), a suitably "normalized" version yields the famous knot invariant called the Jones polynomial . The bracket polynomial plays an important role in unifying the Jones polynomial with other quantum invariants . In particular, Kauffman's interpretation of the Jones polynomial allows generalization to invariants of 3-manifolds .  The bracket polynomial was discovered by Louis Kauffman in 1987.  Definition  The bracket polynomial of any (unoriented) link diagram   L   L   L   , denoted    ⟨  L  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  L    \langle L\rangle   , is a polynomial in the variable   A   A   A   , characterized by the three rules:        ⟨  O  ⟩   =  1       delimited-⟨⟩  O   1    \langle O\rangle=1   , where   O   O   O   is the standard diagram of the unknot        ⟨   O  ∪  L   ⟩   =    (    -   A  2    -   A   -  2     )    ⟨  L  ⟩         delimited-⟨⟩    O  L           superscript  A  2     superscript  A    2      delimited-⟨⟩  L      \langle O\cup L\rangle=(-A^{2}-A^{-2})\langle L\rangle      The pictures in the second rule represent brackets of the link diagrams which differ inside a disc as shown but are identical outside. The third rule means that adding a circle disjoint from the rest of the diagram multiplies the bracket of the remaining diagram by     -   A  2    -   A   -  2           superscript  A  2     superscript  A    2      -A^{2}-A^{-2}   .
