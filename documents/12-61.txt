   Liouville surface      Liouville surface   In the mathematical field of differential geometry a Liouville surface is a type of surface which in local coordinates may be written as a graph in R 3      z  =   f   (  x  ,  y  )        z    f   x  y      z=f(x,y)     such that the first fundamental form is of the form        d   s  2    =    (     f  1    (  x  )    +    f  2    (  y  )     )    (    d   x  2    +   d   y  2     )     .        d   superscript  s  2           subscript  f  1   x      subscript  f  2   y        d   superscript  x  2      d   superscript  y  2        ds^{2}=(f_{1}(x)+f_{2}(y))(dx^{2}+dy^{2}).\,     Sometimes a metric of this form is called a Liouville metric . Every surface of revolution is a Liouville surface.  References    (Translated from the Russian by R. Silverman.)      "  Category:Surfaces
