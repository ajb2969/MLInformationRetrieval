   Point set triangulation      Point set triangulation   A triangulation of a set of points  P in the plane is a triangulation of the convex hull of P , with all points from P being among the vertices of the triangulation.  It can alternatively be defined as a subdivision of the plane determined by a maximal set of non-crossing edges whose vertex set is P . Triangulations are special cases of planar straight-line graphs .  There are special triangulations like the Delaunay triangulation which is the geometric dual of the Voronoi diagram . Subsets of the Delaunay triangulation are the Gabriel graph , nearest neighbor graph and the minimal spanning tree .  Triangulations have a number of applications, and there is an interest to find a "good" triangulation for a given point set under some criteria. One of them is a minimum-weight triangulation . Sometimes it is desirable to have a triangulation with special properties, e.g., in which all triangles have large angles (long and narrow ("splinter") triangles are avoided). 1  Given a set of edges that connect some pairs of the points, the problem to determine whether they contain a triangulation is NP-complete .  Triangulation and convex hull  A triangulation of the set S of n -dimensional points in general position may be derived from the convex hull of a set of points S 1 in the space of dimension larger by 1 which are the projections of the original point set onto the paraboloid surface     x   n  +  1    =    x  1  2   +  ⋯  +   x  n  2         subscript  x    n  1       superscript   subscript  x  1   2   normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  x  n   2      x_{n+1}=x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+x_{n}^{2}   . One has to construct the convex hull of the set S 1 and project it back onto the space of S . If points are not in general position, additional effort is required to triangulate the non-tetrahedral facets .  Complexity of the triangulation  Every triangulation of any set   P   P   P   of n points has     2  n   -  h  -  2        2  n   h  2    2n-h-2   triangles and     3  n   -  h  -  3        3  n   h  3    3n-h-3   edges where   h   h   h   is the number of vertices of    c  h   (  P  )       c  h  P    ch(P)   (the convex hull of P ). 2  Algorithms  Triangle Splitting Algorithm : Find the convex hull of the point set P and triangulate this hull as a polygon. Choose an interior point and draw edges to the three vertices of the triangle that contains it. Continue this process until all interior points are exhausted. 3  Incremental Algorithm : Sort the points of P according to x-coordinates. The first three points determine a triangle. Consider the next point   p   p   p   in the ordered set and connect it with all previously considered points    {   p  1   ,  …  ,   p  k   }      subscript  p  1   normal-…   subscript  p  k     \{p_{1},...,p_{k}\}   which are visible to p. Continue this process of adding one point of P at a time until all of P has been processed. 4  Time complexity of various algorithms  The following is a table of time complexity results for different kinds of optimal point set triangulations.      style="background:white;border:none;"   minimize   maximize       minimum   angle      maximum       O   (    n  2    log  n    )       O     superscript  n  2     n      O(n^{2}\log n)         minimum   area       O   (   n  2   )       O   superscript  n  2     O(n^{2})        maximum       O   (    n  2    log  n    )       O     superscript  n  2     n      O(n^{2}\log n)         maximum   degree   NP-complete for degree of 7     maximum   eccentricity       O   (   n  3   )       O   superscript  n  3     O(n^{3})        minimum   edge length       O   (   n   log  n    )       O    n    n      O(n\log n)    ( Closest pair of points problem )     maximum       O   (   n  2   )       O   superscript  n  2     O(n^{2})          O   (   n   log  n    )       O    n    n      O(n\log n)    (using the Convex hull )     sum of   NP-hard ( Minimum-weight triangulation )      minimum   height      maximum   slope       O   (   n  3   )       O   superscript  n  3     O(n^{3})        See also   Polygon triangulation   Notes  References              de:Gitter (Geometrie)#Dreiecksgitter  fr:Triangulation d'un ensemble de points "  Category:Triangulation (geometry)     ↩  . ↩  Devadoss, O'Rourke Discrete and Computational Geometry .
