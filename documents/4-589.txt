   Orthogonal basis      Orthogonal basis   In mathematics , particularly linear algebra , an orthogonal basis for an inner product space    V   V   V   is a basis for   V   V   V   whose vectors are mutually orthogonal . If the vectors of an orthogonal basis are normalized , the resulting basis is an orthonormal basis .  As coordinates  Any orthogonal basis can be used to define a system of orthogonal coordinates    V   V   V   . Orthogonal (not necessarily orthonormal) bases are important due to their appearance from curvilinear orthogonal coordinates in Euclidean spaces , as well as in Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.  In functional analysis  In functional analysis , an orthogonal basis is any basis obtained from an orthonormal basis (or Hilbert basis) using multiplication by nonzero scalars .  Extensions  The concept of an orthogonal (but not of an orthonormal) basis is applicable to a vector space    V   V   V   (over any field ) equipped with a symmetric bilinear form     ⟨  ·  ,  ·  ⟩     normal-·  normal-·    \langle·,·\rangle   , where orthogonality of two vectors   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   and   𝐰   𝐰   \mathbf{w}   means     ⟨  𝐯  ,  𝐰  ⟩   =  0       𝐯  𝐰   0    \langle\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}\rangle=0   . For an orthogonal basis :       ⟨   𝐞  j   ,   𝐞  k   ⟩   =   {      q   (   𝐞  k   )       j  =  k       0     j  ≠  k      ,      fragments   fragments  normal-⟨   subscript  𝐞  j   normal-,   subscript  𝐞  k   normal-⟩     fragments  normal-{      q   subscript  𝐞  k      j  k     0    j  k      normal-,     \langle\mathbf{e}_{j},\mathbf{e}_{k}\rangle=\left\{\begin{array}[]{ll}q(%
 \mathbf{e}_{k})&j=k\\
 0&j\neq k\end{array}\right.\quad,   where   q   q   q   is a quadratic form associated with    ⟨  ·  ,  ·  ⟩     normal-·  normal-·    \langle·,·\rangle   :     q   (  𝐯  )    =   ⟨  𝐯  ,  𝐯  ⟩         q  𝐯    𝐯  𝐯     q(\mathbf{v})=\langle\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}\rangle   (in an inner product space  v {{!}} 2 }} ). Hence,        ⟨  𝐯  ,  𝐰  ⟩   =    ∑  k    q   (   𝐞  k   )    v  k     w  k       ,       𝐯  𝐰     subscript   k     q   subscript  𝐞  k    superscript  v  k    superscript  w  k       \langle\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}\rangle=\sum\limits_{k}q(\mathbf{e}_{k})v^{k}w^{k}\ ,   where and are components of   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   and   𝐰   𝐰   \mathbf{w}   in .
