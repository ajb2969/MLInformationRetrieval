Orthogonal basis

In mathematics, particularly linear algebra, an orthogonal basis for an inner product space

 
  is a basis for 
 
 
 
  whose vectors are mutually orthogonal. If the vectors of an orthogonal basis are normalized, the resulting basis is an orthonormal basis.
As coordinates
Any orthogonal basis can be used to define a system of orthogonal coordinates

 
 . Orthogonal (not necessarily orthonormal) bases are important due to their appearance from curvilinear orthogonal coordinates in Euclidean spaces, as well as in Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.
In functional analysis
In functional analysis, an orthogonal basis is any basis obtained from an orthonormal basis (or Hilbert basis) using multiplication by nonzero scalars.
Extensions
The concept of an orthogonal (but not of an orthonormal) basis is applicable to a vector space

 
 
  (over any field) equipped with a symmetric bilinear form

 
 , where orthogonality of two vectors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  means 
 
 
 
 . For an orthogonal basis :
