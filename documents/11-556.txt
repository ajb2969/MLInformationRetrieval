(S)-methylmalonyl-CoA hydrolase




(S)-methylmalonyl-CoA hydrolase

In enzymology, a (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-methylmalonyl-CoA + H2O 
 
 
 
  methylmalonate + CoA
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA and H2O, whereas its two products are methylmalonate and CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA hydrolase. This enzyme is also called D-methylmalonyl-coenzyme A hydrolase. This enzyme participates in propanoate metabolism.
