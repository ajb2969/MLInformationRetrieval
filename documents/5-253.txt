   Time-invariant system      Time-invariant system   A time-invariant (TIV) system is a system whose output does not depend explicitly on time. Such systems are regarded as a class of systems in the field of system analysis . Lack of time dependence is captured in the following mathematical property of such a system:   If the input signal    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   produces an output    y   (  t  )       y  t    y(t)   then any time shifted input,    x   (   t  +  δ   )       x    t  δ     x(t+\delta)   , results in a time-shifted output    y   (   t  +  δ   )       y    t  δ     y(t+\delta)       This property can be satisfied if the transfer function of the system is not a function of time except expressed by the input and output.  In the context of a system schematic, this property can also be stated as follows:   If a system is time-invariant then the system block commutes with an arbitrary delay.    If a time-invariant system is also linear , it is the subject of LTI system theory (linear time-invariant) with direct applications in NMR spectroscopy , seismology , circuits , signal processing , control theory , and other technical areas. Nonlinear time-invariant systems lack a comprehensive, governing theory. Discrete time-invariant systems are known as shift-invariant systems . Systems which lack the time-invariant property are studied as time-variant systems .  Simple example  To demonstrate how to determine if a system is time-invariant, consider the two systems:   System A     y   (  t  )    =    t   x   (  t  )          y  t     t  x  t     y(t)=t\,x(t)     System B     y   (  t  )    =   10  x   (  t  )          y  t     10  x  t     y(t)=10x(t)      Since system A explicitly depends on t outside of    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   and    y   (  t  )       y  t    y(t)   , it is not time-invariant. System B, however, does not depend explicitly on t so it is time-invariant.  Formal example  A more formal proof of why system A & B from above differ is now presented. To perform this proof, the second definition will be used.  System A:   Start with a delay of the input      x  d    (  t  )    =   x   (   t  +  δ   )           subscript  x  d   t     x    t  δ      x_{d}(t)=\,\!x(t+\delta)         y   (  t  )    =    t   x   (  t  )          y  t     t  x  t     y(t)=t\,x(t)           y  1    (  t  )    =    t    x  d    (  t  )    =    t   x   (   t  +  δ   )             subscript  y  1   t     t   subscript  x  d   t          t  x    t  δ       y_{1}(t)=t\,x_{d}(t)=t\,x(t+\delta)      Now delay the output by   δ   δ   \delta         y   (  t  )    =    t   x   (  t  )          y  t     t  x  t     y(t)=t\,x(t)           y  2    (  t  )    =   y   (   t  +  δ   )    =    (   t  +  δ   )   x   (   t  +  δ   )             subscript  y  2   t     y    t  δ             t  δ   x    t  δ       y_{2}(t)=\,\!y(t+\delta)=(t+\delta)x(t+\delta)      Clearly      y  1    (  t  )    ≠    y  2    (  t  )           subscript  y  1   t      subscript  y  2   t     y_{1}(t)\,\!\neq y_{2}(t)   , therefore the system is not time-invariant.   System B:   Start with a delay of the input      x  d    (  t  )    =   x   (   t  +  δ   )           subscript  x  d   t     x    t  δ      x_{d}(t)=\,\!x(t+\delta)         y   (  t  )    =    10   x   (  t  )          y  t     10  x  t     y(t)=10\,x(t)           y  1    (  t  )    =    10    x  d    (  t  )    =    10   x   (   t  +  δ   )             subscript  y  1   t     10   subscript  x  d   t          10  x    t  δ       y_{1}(t)=10\,x_{d}(t)=10\,x(t+\delta)      Now delay the output by   δ   δ   \,\!\delta         y   (  t  )    =    10   x   (  t  )          y  t     10  x  t     y(t)=10\,x(t)           y  2    (  t  )    =   y   (   t  +  δ   )    =    10   x   (   t  +  δ   )             subscript  y  2   t     y    t  δ           10  x    t  δ       y_{2}(t)=y(t+\delta)=10\,x(t+\delta)      Clearly      y  1    (  t  )    =    y  2    (  t  )           subscript  y  1   t      subscript  y  2   t     y_{1}(t)=\,\!y_{2}(t)   , therefore the system is time-invariant.   Abstract example  We can denote the shift operator by    𝕋  r     subscript  𝕋  r    \mathbb{T}_{r}   where   r   r   r   is the amount by which a vector's index set should be shifted. For example, the "advance-by-1" system       x   (   t  +  1   )    =     δ   (   t  +  1   )    *  x    (  t  )          x    t  1          δ    t  1    x   t     x(t+1)=\,\!\delta(t+1)*x(t)     can be represented in this abstract notation by        x  ~   1   =     𝕋  1     x  ~         subscript   normal-~  x   1      subscript  𝕋  1    normal-~  x      \tilde{x}_{1}=\mathbb{T}_{1}\,\tilde{x}     where    x  ~     normal-~  x    \tilde{x}   is a function given by       x  ~   =   x   (  t  )    ∀  t    ∈  ℝ         normal-~  x     x  t   for-all  t         ℝ     \tilde{x}=x(t)\,\forall\,t\in\mathbb{R}     with the system yielding the shifted output        x  ~   1   =   x   (   t  +  1   )    ∀  t    ∈  ℝ         subscript   normal-~  x   1     x    t  1    for-all  t         ℝ     \tilde{x}_{1}=x(t+1)\,\forall\,t\in\mathbb{R}     So    𝕋  1     subscript  𝕋  1    \mathbb{T}_{1}   is an operator that advances the input vector by 1.  Suppose we represent a system by an operator    ℍ   ℍ   \mathbb{H}   . This system is time-invariant if it commutes with the shift operator, i.e.,         𝕋  r    ℍ   =    ℍ     𝕋  r     ∀  r           subscript  𝕋  r   ℍ     ℍ   subscript  𝕋  r    for-all  r      \mathbb{T}_{r}\,\mathbb{H}=\mathbb{H}\,\mathbb{T}_{r}\,\,\forall\,r     If our system equation is given by       y  ~   =    ℍ    x  ~         normal-~  y     ℍ   normal-~  x      \tilde{y}=\mathbb{H}\,\tilde{x}     then it is time-invariant if we can apply the system operator   ℍ   ℍ   \mathbb{H}   on    x  ~     normal-~  x    \tilde{x}   followed by the shift operator    𝕋  r     subscript  𝕋  r    \mathbb{T}_{r}   , or we can apply the shift operator    𝕋  r     subscript  𝕋  r    \mathbb{T}_{r}   followed by the system operator   ℍ   ℍ   \mathbb{H}   , with the two computations yielding equivalent results.  Applying the system operator first gives         𝕋  r     ℍ    x  ~    =     𝕋  r     y  ~    =    y  ~   r            subscript  𝕋  r   ℍ   normal-~  x       subscript  𝕋  r    normal-~  y          subscript   normal-~  y   r      \mathbb{T}_{r}\,\mathbb{H}\,\tilde{x}=\mathbb{T}_{r}\,\tilde{y}=\tilde{y}_{r}     Applying the shift operator first gives        ℍ     𝕋  r     x  ~    =    ℍ     x  ~   r          ℍ   subscript  𝕋  r    normal-~  x      ℍ   subscript   normal-~  x   r      \mathbb{H}\,\mathbb{T}_{r}\,\tilde{x}=\mathbb{H}\,\tilde{x}_{r}     If the system is time-invariant, then        ℍ     x  ~   r    =    y  ~   r         ℍ   subscript   normal-~  x   r     subscript   normal-~  y   r     \mathbb{H}\,\tilde{x}_{r}=\tilde{y}_{r}     See also   Finite impulse response  Sheffer sequence  State space (controls)  Signal-flow graph  LTI system theory   "  Category:Control theory  Category:Signal processing
