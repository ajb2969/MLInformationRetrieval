   Glutamin-(asparagin-)ase      Glutamin-(asparagin-)ase   In enzymology , a glutamin-(asparagin-)ase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-glutamine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-glutamate + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-glutamine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are L-glutamate and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutamine(L-asparagine) amidohydrolase . This enzyme participates in 4 metabolic pathways : glutamate metabolism , alanine and aspartate metabolism , d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism , and nitrogen metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
