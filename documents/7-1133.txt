   Darboux's theorem (analysis)      Darboux's theorem (analysis)   Darboux's theorem is a theorem in real analysis , named after Jean Gaston Darboux . It states that all functions that result from the differentiation of other functions have the intermediate value property : the image of an interval is also an interval.  When f is continuously differentiable ( f in C 1 ([ a , b ])), this is a consequence of the intermediate value theorem . But even when f′ is not continuous, Darboux's theorem places a severe restriction on what it can be.  Darboux's theorem  Let   I   I   I   be an open interval ,    f  :   I  →   \R       normal-:  f   normal-→  I  \R     f\colon I\to\R   a real-valued differentiable function. Then    f  ′     superscript  f  normal-′    f^{\prime}   has the intermediate value property : If   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   are points in   I   I   I   with     f  ′    (  a  )        superscript  f  normal-′   a    f^{\prime}(a)   between     f  ′    (  b  )        superscript  f  normal-′   b    f^{\prime}(b)   and   x   x   x   , there exists an    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   in      f  ′    (  x  )    =  y         superscript  f  normal-′   x   y    f^{\prime}(x)=y   such that   y   y   y   . 1  Proof  If     f  ′    (  a  )        superscript  f  normal-′   a    f^{\prime}(a)   equals     f  ′    (  b  )        superscript  f  normal-′   b    f^{\prime}(b)   or   x   x   x   , then setting   a   a   a   equal to   b   b   b   or   y   y   y   , respectively, works. Therefore, without loss of generality, we may assume that     f  ′    (  a  )        superscript  f  normal-′   a    f^{\prime}(a)   is strictly between     f  ′    (  b  )        superscript  f  normal-′   b    f^{\prime}(b)   and      f  ′    (  a  )    >  y  >    f  ′    (  b  )             superscript  f  normal-′   a   y          superscript  f  normal-′   b      f^{\prime}(a)>y>f^{\prime}(b)   , and in particular that    ϕ  :   I  →   \R       normal-:  ϕ   normal-→  I  \R     \phi\colon I\to\R   . Define a new function      ϕ   (  t  )    =    f   (  t  )    -   y  t     .        ϕ  t       f  t     y  t      \phi(t)=f(t)-yt.   by     ϕ   ϕ   \phi   Since    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   is continuous on the closed interval   x   x   x   , its maximum value on that interval is attained, according to the extreme value theorem , at a point    x  ∈   [  a  ,  b  ]       x   a  b     x\in[a,b]   in that interval, i.e. at some      ϕ  ′    (  a  )    =     f  ′    (  a  )    -  y   >   y  -  y   =  0           superscript  ϕ  normal-′   a        superscript  f  normal-′   a   y          y  y        0     \phi^{\prime}(a)=f^{\prime}(a)-y>y-y=0   . Because   b   b   b   and   x   x   x   nor   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   can be a point, such as    x  ∈   (  a  ,  b  )       x   a  b     x\in(a,b)   , at which      ϕ  ′    (  x  )    =  0         superscript  ϕ  normal-′   x   0    \phi^{\prime}(x)=0   attains a local maximum. Therefore,      f  ′    (  x  )    =  y         superscript  f  normal-′   x   y    f^{\prime}(x)=y   . Hence, again by Fermat's theorem,    x  ↦   sin   (   1  /  x   )       maps-to  x      1  x      x\mapsto\sin(1/x)   , i.e.    x  ↦    x  2    sin   (   1  /  x   )        maps-to  x     superscript  x  2       1  x       x\mapsto x^{2}\sin(1/x)   . 2  Another proof based solely on the mean value theorem and the intermediate value theorem is due to Lars Olsen. 3  Darboux function  A Darboux function is a real-valued function  f which has the "intermediate value property": for any two values a and b in the domain of f , and any y between f ( a ) and f ( b ), there is some c between a and b with f ( c ) = y . 4 By the intermediate value theorem , every continuous function is a Darboux function. Darboux's contribution was to show that there are discontinuous Darboux functions.  Every discontinuity of a Darboux function is essential , that is, at any point of discontinuity, at least one of the left hand and right hand limits does not exist.  An example of a Darboux function that is discontinuous at one point, is the function $x \mapsto \sin(1/x)$ .  By Darboux's theorem, the derivative of any differentiable function is a Darboux function. In particular, the derivative of the function $x \mapsto x^2\sin(1/x)$ is a Darboux function that is not continuous.  An example of a Darboux function that is nowhere continuous is the Conway base 13 function .  Darboux functions are a quite general class of functions. It turns out that any real-valued function f on the real line can be written as the sum of two Darboux functions. 5 This implies in particular that the class of Darboux functions is not closed under addition.  A strongly Darboux function is one for which the image of every (non-empty) open interval is the whole real line. Such functions exist and are Darboux but nowhere continuous. 6  Notes    External links      "  Category:Theorems in calculus  Category:Continuous mappings  Category:Theorems in real analysis  Category:Articles containing proofs      Olsen, Lars: A New Proof of Darboux's Theorem , Vol. 111, No. 8 (Oct., 2004) (pp. 713–715), The American Mathematical Monthly ↩   ↩  Bruckner, Andrew M: Differentiation of real functions , 2 ed, page 6, American Mathematical Society, 1994 ↩
