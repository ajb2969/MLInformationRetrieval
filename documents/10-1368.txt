   3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase      3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-hydroxyanthranilate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-amino-3-carboxymuconate semialdehyde   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-hydroxyanthranilate and O 2 , whereas its product is 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate semialdehyde .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-hydroxyanthranilate:oxygen 3,4-oxidoreductase (decyclizing) . Other names in common use include 3-hydroxyanthranilate oxygenase , 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase , 3-hydroxyanthranilic oxygenase , 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxidase , and 3HAO . This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism . It employs one cofactor , iron .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .  References    Boyer, P.D., Lardy, H. and Myrback, K.
