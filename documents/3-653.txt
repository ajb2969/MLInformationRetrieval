   Central simple algebra      Central simple algebra   In ring theory and related areas of mathematics a central simple algebra ( CSA ) over a field  K is a finite-dimensional associative algebra  A , which is simple , and for which the center is exactly K . In other words, any simple algebra is a central simple algebra over its center.  For example, the complex numbers  C form a CSA over themselves, but not over the real numbers  R (the center of C is all of C , not just R ). The quaternions  H form a 4-dimensional CSA over R , and in fact represent the only non-trivial element of the Brauer group of the reals (see below).  Given two central simple algebras A ~ M ( n , S ) and B ~ M ( m , T ) over the same field F , A and B are called similar (or Brauer equivalent ) if their division rings S and T are isomorphic. The set of all equivalence classes of central simple algebras over a given field F , under this equivalence relation, can be equipped with a group operation given by the tensor product of algebras . The resulting group is called the Brauer group Br( F ) of the field F . 1 It is always a torsion group . 2  Properties   According to the Artin–Wedderburn theorem a finite-dimensional simple algebra A is isomorphic to the matrix algebra M ( n , S ) for some division ring  S . Hence, there is a unique division algebra in each Brauer equivalence class. 3  Every automorphism of a central simple algebra is an inner automorphism (follows from Skolem–Noether theorem ).  The dimension of a central simple algebra as a vector space over its centre is always a square: the degree is the square root of this dimension. 4 The Schur index of a central simple algebra is the degree of the equivalent division algebra: 5 it depends only on the Brauer class of the algebra. 6  The period or exponent of a central simple algebra is the order of its Brauer class as an element of the Brauer group. It is a divisor of the index, 7 and the two numbers are composed of the same prime factors. 8 9 10  If S is a simple subalgebra of a central simple algebra A then dim F  S divides dim F  A .  Every 4-dimensional central simple algebra over a field F is isomorphic to a quaternion algebra ; in fact, it is either a two-by-two matrix algebra , or a division algebra .  If D is a central division algebra over K for which the index has prime factorisation          ind   (  D  )    =    ∏   i  =  1   r    p  i   m  i           ind  D     superscript   subscript  product    i  1    r    superscript   subscript  p  i    subscript  m  i       \mathrm{ind}(D)=\prod_{i=1}^{r}p_{i}^{m_{i}}       then D has a tensor product decomposition     D  =   ⊗   i  =  1   r    D  i      fragments  D    superscript   subscript  tensor-product    i  1    r    subscript  D  i     D=\otimes_{i=1}^{r}D_{i}      where each component D i is a central division algebra of index    p  i   m  i      superscript   subscript  p  i    subscript  m  i     p_{i}^{m_{i}}   , and the components are uniquely determined up to isomorphism. 11    Splitting field  We call a field E a splitting field for A over K if A ⊗ E is isomorphic to a matrix ring over E . Every finite dimensional CSA has a splitting field: indeed, in the case when A is a division algebra, then a maximal subfield of A is a splitting field. In general by theorems of Wedderburn and Koethe there is a splitting field which is a separable extension of K of degree equal to the index of A , and this splitting field is isomorphic to a subfield of A . 12 13 As an example, the field C splits the quaternion algebra H over R with        t  +   x  𝐢   +   y  𝐣   +   z  𝐤    ↔   (      t  +   x  i       y  +   z  i                            -  y   +   z  i       t  -   x  i                         )    .     normal-↔    t    x  𝐢     y  𝐣     z  𝐤        t    x  i      y    z  i     missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression         y     z  i      t    x  i     missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression       t+x\mathbf{i}+y\mathbf{j}+z\mathbf{k}\leftrightarrow\left({\begin{array}[]{*{2%
 0}c}t+xi&y+zi\\
 -y+zi&t-xi\end{array}}\right).     We can use the existence of the splitting field to define reduced norm and reduced trace for a CSA A . 14 Map A to a matrix ring over a splitting field and define the reduced norm and trace to be the composite of this map with determinant and trace respectively. For example, in the quaternion algebra H , the splitting above shows that the element t + x  i + y  j + z  k has reduced norm t 2 + x 2 + y 2 + z 2 and reduced trace 2 t .  The reduced norm is multiplicative and the reduced trace is additive. An element a of A is invertible if and only if its reduced norm in non-zero: hence a CSA is a division algebra if and only if the reduced norm is non-zero on the non-zero elements. 15  Generalization  CSAs over a field K are a non-commutative analog to extension fields over K – in both cases, they have no non-trivial 2-sided ideals, and have a distinguished field in their center, though a CSA can be non-commutative and need not have inverses (need not be a division algebra ). This is of particular interest in noncommutative number theory as generalizations of number fields (extensions of the rationals Q ); see noncommutative number field .
