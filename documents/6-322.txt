Gauss–Kuzmin distribution

In mathematics, the Gauss–Kuzmin distribution is a discrete probability distribution that arises as the limit probability distribution of the coefficients in the continued fraction expansion of a random variable uniformly distributed in (0, 1).1 The distribution is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, who derived it around 1800,2 and Rodion Kuzmin, who gave a bound on the rate of convergence in 1929.34 It is given by the probability mass function



Gauss–Kuzmin theorem
Let



be the continued fraction expansion of a random number x uniformly distributed in (0, 1). Then



Equivalently, let



then



tends to zero as n tends to infinity.
Rate of convergence
In 1928, Kuzmin gave the bound



In 1929, Paul Lévy5 improved it to



Later, Eduard Wirsing showed6 that, for λ=0.30366... (the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing constant), the limit



exists for every s in [0, 1], and the function Ψ(s) is analytic and satisfies Ψ(0)=Ψ(1)=0. Further bounds were proved by K.I.Babenko.7
