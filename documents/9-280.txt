   Stefan number      Stefan number   The Stefan number 1 ( St or Ste ) is defined as the ratio of sensible heat to latent heat . It is given by the formula       Ste  =     c  p   Δ  T   L    ,      Ste       subscript  c  p   normal-Δ  T   L     \mathrm{Ste}=\frac{c_{p}\Delta T}{L},     where   c p is the specific heat ,  ∆ T is the temperature difference between phases,  L is the latent heat of melting.   It is a dimensionless parameter that is useful in analyzing a Stefan problem . The parameter was developed from Josef Stefan 's calculations of the rate of phase change of water into ice on the polar ice caps .
