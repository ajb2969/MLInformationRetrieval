   Semiparametric model      Semiparametric model   In statistics a semiparametric model is a model that has parametric and nonparametric components.  A model is a collection of distributions    {   P  Œ∏   :   Œ∏  ‚àà  Œò   }     conditional-set   subscript  P  Œ∏     Œ∏  normal-Œò     \{P_{\theta}:\theta\in\Theta\}   indexed by a parameter   Œ∏   Œ∏   \theta   .   A parametric model is one in which the indexing parameter is a finite-dimensional vector (in   k   k   k   -dimensional Euclidean space for some integer   k   k   k   ); i.e. the set of possible values for   Œ∏   Œ∏   \theta   is a subset of    ‚Ñù  k     superscript  ‚Ñù  k    \mathbb{R}^{k}   , or    Œò  ‚äÇ   ‚Ñù  k       normal-Œò   superscript  ‚Ñù  k     \Theta\subset\mathbb{R}^{k}   . In this case we say that   Œ∏   Œ∏   \theta   is finite-dimensional.  In nonparametric models , the set of possible values of the parameter   Œ∏   Œ∏   \theta   is a subset of some space, not necessarily finite-dimensional. For example, we might consider the set of all distributions with mean 0. Such spaces are vector spaces with topological structure, but may not be finite-dimensional as vector spaces. Thus,    Œò  ‚äÇ  ùîΩ      normal-Œò  ùîΩ    \Theta\subset\mathbb{F}   for some possibly infinite-dimensional space   ùîΩ   ùîΩ   \mathbb{F}   .  In semiparametric models, the parameter has both a finite-dimensional component and an infinite-dimensional component (often a real-valued function defined on the real line). Thus the parameter space   Œò   normal-Œò   \Theta   in a semiparametric model satisfies    Œò  ‚äÇ    ‚Ñù  k   √ó  ùîΩ       normal-Œò     superscript  ‚Ñù  k   ùîΩ     \Theta\subset\mathbb{R}^{k}\times\mathbb{F}   , where   ùîΩ   ùîΩ   \mathbb{F}   is an infinite-dimensional space.   It may appear at first that semiparametric models include nonparametric models, since they have an infinite-dimensional as well as a finite-dimensional component. However, a semiparametric model is considered to be "smaller" than a completely nonparametric model because we are often interested only in the finite-dimensional component of   Œ∏   Œ∏   \theta   . That is, we are not interested in estimating the infinite-dimensional component. In nonparametric models, by contrast, the primary interest is in estimating the infinite-dimensional parameter. Thus the estimation task is statistically harder in nonparametric models.  These models often use smoothing or kernels .  Example  A well-known example of a semiparametric model is the Cox proportional hazards model . 1 If we are interested in studying the time   T   T   T   to an event such as death due to cancer or failure of a light bulb, the Cox model specifies the following distribution function for   T   T   T   :        F   (  t  )    =   1  -   exp   (   -    ‚à´  0  t     Œª  0    (  u  )    e    Œ≤  ‚Ä≤   x    d  u     )      ,        F  t     1        superscript   subscript   0   t      subscript  Œª  0   u   superscript  e     superscript  Œ≤  normal-‚Ä≤   x    d  u         F(t)=1-\exp\left(-\int_{0}^{t}\lambda_{0}(u)e^{\beta^{\prime}x}du\right),   where   x   x   x   is the covariate vector, and   Œ≤   Œ≤   \beta   and     Œª  0    (  u  )        subscript  Œª  0   u    \lambda_{0}(u)   are unknown parameters.    Œ∏  =   (  Œ≤  ,    Œª  0    (  u  )    )       Œ∏   Œ≤     subscript  Œª  0   u      \theta=(\beta,\lambda_{0}(u))   . Here   Œ≤   Œ≤   \beta   is finite-dimensional and is of interest;     Œª  0    (  u  )        subscript  Œª  0   u    \lambda_{0}(u)   is an unknown non-negative function of time (known as the baseline hazard function) and is often a nuisance parameter . The collection of possible candidates for     Œª  0    (  u  )        subscript  Œª  0   u    \lambda_{0}(u)   is infinite-dimensional.
