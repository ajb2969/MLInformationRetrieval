   Pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase      Pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a pyridoxal 4-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   pyridoxal + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-pyridoxolactone + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are pyridoxal and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 4-pyridoxolactone , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pyridoxal:NAD + 4-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called pyridoxal dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in vitamin B 6 metabolism .
