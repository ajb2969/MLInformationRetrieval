   Treynor ratio      Treynor ratio   The Treynor ratio (sometimes called the reward-to-volatility ratio or Treynor measure 1 ), named after Jack L. Treynor , 2 is a measurement of the returns earned in excess of that which could have been earned on an investment that has no diversifiable risk (e.g., Treasury bills or a completely diversified portfolio), per each unit of market risk assumed.  The Treynor ratio relates excess return over the risk-free rate to the additional risk taken; however, systematic risk is used instead of total risk. The higher the Treynor ratio, the better the performance of the portfolio under analysis.  Formula      T  =     r  i   -   r  f     β  i        T       subscript  r  i    subscript  r  f     subscript  β  i      T=\frac{r_{i}-r_{f}}{\beta_{i}}     where:      T  ≡       T  absent    T\equiv   Treynor ratio,       r  i   ≡        subscript  r  i   absent    r_{i}\equiv   portfolio i 's return,       r  f   ≡        subscript  r  f   absent    r_{f}\equiv    risk free rate       β  i   ≡        subscript  β  i   absent    \beta_{i}\equiv    portfolio i 's beta  Limitations  Like the Sharpe ratio , the Treynor ratio ( T ) does not quantify the value added, if any, of active portfolio management . It is a ranking criterion only. A ranking of portfolios based on the Treynor Ratio is only useful if the portfolios under consideration are sub-portfolios of a broader, fully diversified portfolio. If this is not the case, portfolios with identical systematic risk , but different total risk, will be rated the same. But the portfolio with a higher total risk is less diversified and therefore has a higher unsystematic risk which is not priced in the market.  An alternative method of ranking portfolio management is Jensen's alpha , which quantifies the added return as the excess return above the security market line in the capital asset pricing model . As these two methods both determine rankings based on systematic risk alone, they will rank portfolios identically.
