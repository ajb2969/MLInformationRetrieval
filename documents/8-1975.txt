Loomis–Whitney inequality

In mathematics, the Loomis–Whitney inequality is a result in geometry, which in its simplest form, allows one to estimate the "size" of a d-dimensional set by the sizes of its (d – 1)-dimensional projections. The inequality has applications in incidence geometry, the study of so-called "lattice animals", and other areas.
The result is named after the American mathematicians L. H. Loomis and Hassler Whitney, and was published in 1949.
Statement of the inequality
Fix a dimension d ≥ 2 and consider the projections






For each 1 ≤ j ≤ d, let






Then the Loomis–Whitney inequality holds:



Equivalently, taking






A special case
The Loomis–Whitney inequality can be used to relate the Lebesgue measure of a subset of Euclidean space

 
  to its "average widths" in the coordinate directions. Let E be some measurable subset of 
 
 
 
  and let



be the indicator function of the projection of E onto the jth coordinate hyperplane. It follows that for any point x in E,



Hence, by the Loomis–Whitney inequality,



and hence



The quantity



can be thought of as the average width of E in the jth coordinate direction. This interpretation of the Loomis–Whitney inequality also holds if we consider a finite subset of Euclidean space and replace Lebesgue measure by counting measure.
Generalizations
The Loomis–Whitney inequality is a special case of the Brascamp–Lieb inequality, in which the projections πj above are replaced by more general linear maps, not necessarily all mapping onto spaces of the same dimension.
