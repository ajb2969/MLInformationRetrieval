   Dean number      Dean number   The Dean number ( D ) is a dimensionless group in fluid mechanics , which occurs in the study of flow in curved pipes and channels. It is named after the British scientist W. R. Dean , who studied such flows in the 1920s (Dean, 1927, 1928).  Definition  The Dean number is typically denoted by De (or Dn ). For a flow in a pipe or tube it is defined as:      𝐷𝑒  =     ρ   V   d   μ     (   d  R   )    1  /  2         𝐷𝑒        ρ  V  d   μ    superscript    d  R     1  2       \mathit{De}=\frac{\rho V\!d}{\mu}\left(\frac{d}{R}\right)^{1/2}     where      ρ   ρ   \rho   is the density of the fluid     μ   μ   \mu   is the dynamic viscosity     V   V   V   is the axial velocity scale     d   d   d   is the diameter (for non-circular geometry, an equivalent diameter is used; see Reynolds number )     R   R   R   is the radius of curvature of the path of the channel.   The Dean number is therefore the product of the Reynolds number (based on axial flow   V   V   V   through a pipe of diameter   d   d   d   ) and the square root of the curvature ratio.  The Dean equations  The Dean number appears in the so-called Dean equations . These are an approximation to the full Navier–Stokes equations for the steady axially uniform flow of a Newtonian fluid in a toroidal pipe, obtained by retaining just the leading order curvature effects (i.e. the leading-order equations for     a  /  r   ≪  1     much-less-than    a  r   1    a/r\ll 1   ).  We use orthogonal coordinates     (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )     x  y  z    (x,y,z)   with corresponding unit vectors    (   𝒙  ^   ,   𝒚  ^   ,   𝒛  ^   )      normal-^  𝒙    normal-^  𝒚    normal-^  𝒛     (\hat{\boldsymbol{x}},\hat{\boldsymbol{y}},\hat{\boldsymbol{z}})   aligned with the centre-line of the pipe at each point. The axial direction is    𝒛  ^     normal-^  𝒛    \hat{\boldsymbol{z}}   , with    𝒙  ^     normal-^  𝒙    \hat{\boldsymbol{x}}   being the normal in the plane of the centre-line, and    𝒚  ^     normal-^  𝒚    \hat{\boldsymbol{y}}   the binormal . For an axial flow driven by a pressure gradient   G   G   G   , the axial velocity    u  z     subscript  u  z    u_{z}   is scaled with    U  =    G   a  2    /  μ       U      G   superscript  a  2    μ     U=Ga^{2}/\mu   . The cross-stream velocities     u  x   ,   u  y       subscript  u  x    subscript  u  y     u_{x},u_{y}   are scaled with      (   a  /  R   )    1  /  2    U       superscript    a  R     1  2    U    (a/R)^{1/2}U   , and cross-stream pressures with     ρ  a   U  2    /  L        ρ  a   superscript  U  2    L    \rho aU^{2}/L   . Lengths are scaled with the tube radius   a   a   a   .  In terms of these non-dimensional variables and coordinates, the Dean equations are then       D   (     D   u  x     D  t    +   u  z  2    )    =    -   D    ∂  p    ∂  x      +    ∇  2    u  x           D        normal-D   subscript  u  x      normal-D  t     superscript   subscript  u  z   2           D      p     x        superscript  normal-∇  2    subscript  u  x       D\left(\frac{\mathrm{D}u_{x}}{\mathrm{D}t}+u_{z}^{2}\right)=-D\frac{\partial p%

 \partial}{\partial y}   is the convective derivative .  The Dean number D is the only parameter left in the system, and encapsulates the leading order curvature effects. Higher-order approximations will involve additional parameters.  For weak curvature effects (small D ), the Dean equations can be solved as a series expansion in D . The first correction to the leading-order axial Poiseuille flow is a pair of vortices in the cross-section carrying flow form the inside to the outside of the bend across the centre and back around the edges. This solution is stable up to a critical Dean number     D  c   ≈  956       subscript  D  c   956    D_{c}\approx 956   (Dennis & Ng 1982). For larger D , there are multiple solutions, many of which are unstable.  References       Mestel, J. Flow in curved pipes: The Dean equations , Lecture Handout for Course M4A33 , Imperial College.
