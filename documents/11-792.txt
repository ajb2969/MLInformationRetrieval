Thiocyanate hydrolase




Thiocyanate hydrolase

In enzymology, a thiocyanate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

thiocyanate + 2 H2O 
 
 
 
  carbonyl sulfide + NH3 + HO-
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are thiocyanate and H2O, whereas its 3 products are carbonyl sulfide, NH3, and HO-.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in nitriles. The systematic name of this enzyme class is thiocyanate aminohydrolase.
