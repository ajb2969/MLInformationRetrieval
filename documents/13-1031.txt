   Shoshana Kamin      Shoshana Kamin   Shoshana Kamin (, ) (born December 24, 1930), 1 born Susanna L'vovna Kamenomostskaya (), 2 3 is a Soviet -born Israeli  mathematician , working on the theory of parabolic partial differential equations and related mathematical physics problems.  Biography and work  Shoshana Kamin graduated from Moscow University in 1953 and earned her " candidate of science " degree from the same university in 1959, 4 under the supervision of Olga Oleinik . 5 She left the Soviet Union in the early 1970, becoming professor in Tel Aviv University , 6 where she is now professor emeritus . 7  In the late 1950s, she gave the first proof of the existence and uniqueness of the generalized solution of the three- dimensional  Stefan problem . 8 Her proof was generalised by Oleinik. 9  Later, she made important contributions to the study of the porous medium equation, 10          ∂  t   u   =    Δ  x    u  m     ,   m  >  1    ,     formulae-sequence      subscript   t   u      subscript  normal-Δ  x    superscript  u  m       m  1     \partial_{t}u=\Delta_{x}u^{m},\,\,m>1,\,     and to non-linear elliptic equations. 11  Selected Publications    . The earlier account of the research of Shoshana Kamin on the Stefan problem .   . In this paper and in the paper , the first existence and uniqueness proofs for the generalized solution of the three-dimensional Stefan problem are given.   .   . According to  this is one of the most important papers in the asymptotic theory of the porous medium equation . Also, perhaps for the last time ever, she signed this work with both her present and former surnames, precisely writing " S. Kamin (Kamenomostskaya) ".

The " Mathematics in the USSR 1958–1967 " is a two–volume continuation of the opus " Mathematics in the USSR during its first forty years 1917–1957 " and describes the developments of Soviet mathematics during the period 1958–1967. Precisely it is meant as a continuation of the second volume of that work and, as such, is titled " Biobibliography " (evidently an acronym of biography and bibliography ). It includes new biographies (when possible, brief and complete) and bibliographies of works published by new Soviet mathematicians during that period, and updates on the work and biographies of scientist included in the former volume, alphabetically ordered with respect to author's surname.    . An almost comprehensive obituary article: its English  translation is published in the Russian Mathematical Surveys as .   Scientific references    .   .   .   .   .
