   Semicircular potential well      Semicircular potential well   In quantum mechanics , the case of a particle in a one-dimensional ring is similar to the particle in a box . The particle follows the path of a semicircle from   0   0    to   π   π   \pi   where it cannot escape, because the potential from   π   π   \pi   to    2  π      2  π    2\pi   is infinite. Instead there is total reflection, meaning the particle bounces back and forth between   0   0    to   π   π   \pi   . The Schrödinger equation for a free particle which is restricted to a semicircle (technically, whose configuration space is the circle     S  1     superscript  S  1    S^{1}   ) is       -     ℏ  2    2  m      ∇  2   ψ     =    E  ψ    (  1  )               superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2     2  m      superscript  normal-∇  2   ψ        E  ψ   1     -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2}\psi=E\psi\quad(1)     Wave function  Using cylindrical coordinates on the 1-dimensional semicircle, the wave function depends only on the angular  coordinate , and so       ∇  2   =     1   s  2      ∂  2    ∂   ϕ  2       (  2  )         superscript  normal-∇  2        1   superscript  s  2       superscript   2      superscript  ϕ  2      2     \nabla^{2}=\frac{1}{s^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\phi^{2}}\quad(2)     Substituting the Laplacian in cylindrical coordinates, the wave function is therefore expressed as       -     ℏ  2    2  m   s  2        d  2   ψ    d   ϕ  2       =    E  ψ    (  3  )               superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2     2  m   superscript  s  2          superscript  d  2   ψ     d   superscript  ϕ  2          E  ψ   3     -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2ms^{2}}\frac{d^{2}\psi}{d\phi^{2}}=E\psi\quad(3)     The moment of inertia for a semicircle, best expressed in cylindrical coordinates, is     I     =  def      ∭  V      r  2    ρ   (  r  ,  ϕ  ,  z  )   r  d   r   d   ϕ   d   z         superscript   def   I    subscript  triple-integral  V      superscript  r  2   ρ   r  ϕ  z   r  d  r  d  ϕ  d  z      I\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \iiint_{V}r^{2}\,\rho(r,\phi,z)\,rdr\,d\phi\,dz\!   . Solving the integral, one finds that the moment of inertia of a semicircle is    I  =   m   s  2        I    m   superscript  s  2      I=ms^{2}   , exactly the same for a hoop of the same radius. The wave function can now be expressed as     -     ℏ  2    2  I       d  2   ψ    d   ϕ  2       =   E  ψ              superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2     2  I         superscript  d  2   ψ     d   superscript  ϕ  2         E  ψ     -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2I}\frac{d^{2}\psi}{d\phi^{2}}=E\psi   , which is easily solvable.  Since the particle cannot escape the region from   0   0    to   π   π   \pi   , the general solution to this differential equation is        ψ    (  ϕ  )    =     A   cos   (   m  ϕ   )     +   B   sin   (   m  ϕ   )       (  4  )          ψ  ϕ        A      m  ϕ       B      m  ϕ      4     \ \psi(\phi)=A\cos(m\phi)+B\sin(m\phi)\quad(4)     Defining    m  =     2  I  E    ℏ  2         m        2  I  E    superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2       m=\sqrt{\frac{2IE}{\hbar^{2}}}   , we can calculate the energy as    E  =     m  2    ℏ  2     2  I        E       superscript  m  2    superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2      2  I      E=\frac{m^{2}\hbar^{2}}{2I}   . We then apply the boundary conditions, where   ψ   ψ   \psi   and     d  ψ    d  ϕ         d  ψ     d  ϕ     \frac{d\psi}{d\phi}   are continuous and the wave function is normalizable:        ∫  0  π       |   ψ   (  ϕ  )    |   2    d  ϕ    =   1   (  5  )          superscript   subscript   0   π      superscript      ψ  ϕ    2   d  ϕ     1  5     \int_{0}^{\pi}\left|\psi(\phi)\right|^{2}\,d\phi=1\ \quad(5)   .  Like the infinite square well, the first boundary condition demands that the wave function equals 0 at both    ϕ  =  0      ϕ  0    \phi=0   and    ϕ  =  π      ϕ  π    \phi=\pi   . Basically         ψ    (  0  )    =   ψ   (  π  )    =  0    (  6  )      formulae-sequence        ψ  0     ψ  π        0    6    \ \psi(0)=\psi(\pi)=0\quad(6)   .  Since the wave function      ψ    (  0  )    =  0        ψ  0   0    \ \psi(0)=0   , the coefficient A must equal 0 because      cos    (  0  )    =  1        0   1    \ \cos(0)=1   . The wave function also equals 0 at    ϕ  =  π      ϕ  π    \phi=\pi   so we must apply this boundary condition. Discarding the trivial solution where B=0, the wave function      ψ    (  π  )    =  0  =   B   sin   (   m  π   )             ψ  π   0         B      m  π        \ \psi(\pi)=0=B\sin(m\pi)   only when m is an integer since     sin   (   n  π   )    =  0          n  π    0    \sin(n\pi)=0   . This boundary condition quantizes the energy where the energy equals    E  =     m  2    ℏ  2     2  I        E       superscript  m  2    superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2      2  I      E=\frac{m^{2}\hbar^{2}}{2I}   where m is any integer. The condition m=0 is ruled out because    ψ  =  0      ψ  0    \psi=0   everywhere, meaning that the particle is not in the potential at all. Negative integers are also ruled out.  We then normalize the wave function, yielding a result where    B  =    2  π        B      2  π      B=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}   . The normalized wave function is        ψ    (  ϕ  )    =      2  π     sin   (   m  ϕ   )      (  7  )          ψ  ϕ          2  π        m  ϕ     7     \ \psi(\phi)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\sin(m\phi)\quad(7)   .  The ground state energy of the system is    E  =    ℏ  2    2  I        E     superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2     2  I      E=\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2I}   . Like the particle in a box, there exists nodes in the excited states of the system where both     ψ    (  ϕ  )       ψ  ϕ    \ \psi(\phi)   and     ψ     (  ϕ  )   2       ψ   superscript  ϕ  2     \ \psi(\phi)^{2}   are both 0, which means that the probability of finding the particle at these nodes are 0.  Analysis  Since the wave function is only dependent on the azimuthal angle   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   , the measurable quantities of the system are the angular position and angular momentum, expressed with the operators   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   and    L  z     subscript  L  z    L_{z}   respectively.  Using cylindrical coordinates, the operators   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   and    L  z     subscript  L  z    L_{z}   are expressed as   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   and    -   i  ℏ   d   d  ϕ           i  Planck-constant-over-2-pi    d    d  ϕ       -i\hbar\frac{d}{d\phi}   respectively, where these observables play a role similar to position and momentum for the particle in a box. The commutation and uncertainty relations for angular position and angular momentum are given as follows:       [  ϕ  ,   L  z   ]   =    i   ℏ   ψ   (  ϕ  )     (  8  )         ϕ   subscript  L  z       i  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  ψ  ϕ   8     [\phi,L_{z}]=i\hbar\ \psi(\phi)\quad(8)           (   Δ  ϕ   )    (   Δ   L  z    )    ≥   ℏ  2           normal-Δ  ϕ     normal-Δ   subscript  L  z       Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2     (\Delta\phi)(\Delta L_{z})\geq\frac{\hbar}{2}   where      Δ  ψ   ϕ   =      ⟨   ϕ  2   ⟩   ψ   -    ⟨  ϕ  ⟩   ψ  2            subscript  normal-Δ  ψ   ϕ        subscript   delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  ϕ  2    ψ    superscript   subscript   delimited-⟨⟩  ϕ   ψ   2       \Delta_{\psi}\phi=\sqrt{\langle{\phi}^{2}\rangle_{\psi}-\langle{\phi}\rangle_{%
 \psi}^{2}}   and      Δ  ψ    L  z    =       ⟨   L  z    2   ⟩   ψ   -    ⟨   L  z   ⟩   ψ  2      (  9  )           subscript  normal-Δ  ψ    subscript  L  z          subscript   delimited-⟨⟩   superscript   subscript  L  z   2    ψ    superscript   subscript   delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  L  z    ψ   2     9     \Delta_{\psi}L_{z}=\sqrt{\langle{L_{z}}^{2}\rangle_{\psi}-\langle{L_{z}}%
 \rangle_{\psi}^{2}}\quad(9)     Boundary conditions  As with all quantum mechanics problems, if the boundary conditions are changed so does the wave function. If a particle is confined to the motion of an entire ring ranging from 0 to    2  π      2  π    2\pi   , the particle is subject only to a periodic boundary condition (see particle in a ring ). If a particle is confined to the motion of     -  π   2        π   2    \frac{-\pi}{2}   to    π  2      π  2    \frac{\pi}{2}   , the issue of even and odd parity becomes important.  The wave equation for such a potential is given as:         ψ   o    (  ϕ  )    =      2  π     cos   (   m  ϕ   )      (  10  )           subscript  ψ  o   ϕ          2  π        m  ϕ     10     \ \psi_{o}(\phi)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\cos(m\phi)\quad(10)            ψ   e    (  ϕ  )    =      2  π     sin   (   m  ϕ   )      (  11  )           subscript  ψ  e   ϕ          2  π        m  ϕ     11     \ \psi_{e}(\phi)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\sin(m\phi)\quad(11)     where      ψ   o    (  ϕ  )        subscript  ψ  o   ϕ    \ \psi_{o}(\phi)   and      ψ   e    (  ϕ  )        subscript  ψ  e   ϕ    \ \psi_{e}(\phi)   are for odd and even m respectively.  Similarly, if the semicircular potential well is a finite well, the solution will resemble that of the finite potential well where the angular operators   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   and    L  z     subscript  L  z    L_{z}   replace the linear operators x and p.
