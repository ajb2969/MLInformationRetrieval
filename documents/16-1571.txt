   Clement W. H. Lam      Clement W. H. Lam   Clement Wing Hong Lam () is a Canadian mathematician, specializing in combinatorics . He is famous for the computer proof, with Larry Thiel and S. Swiercz, of the nonexistence of a finite projective plane of order 10. 1  Lam earned his PhD in 1974 under Herbert Ryser at Caltech with thesis Rational G-Circulants Satisfying the Matrix Equation $A^2=d I+\lambda J$ . 2 He is a professor at Concordia University in Montreal .  In 2006 he received the Euler medal . In 1992 he received the Lester Randolph Ford Award for the article The search for a finite projective plane of order 10 . 3 The eponymous Lam's problem is equivalent to finding a finite projective plane of order 10 or finding 9 orthogonal Latin squares of order 10. 4  See also   Experimental mathematics   References  External links   Homepage  [ http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q =&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_occt=any&as_sauthors=cwh+lam&as_publication=&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C11 search on author CWH Lam] from Google Scholar   "  Category:Canadian mathematicians  Category:Combinatorialists  Category:California Institute of Technology alumni  Category:Concordia University faculty  Category:Living people  Category:Year of birth missing (living people)  Category:Place of birth missing (living people)     ↩  ↩  ↩  Lam´s Problem at Mathworld ↩
