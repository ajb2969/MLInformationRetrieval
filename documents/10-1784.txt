   Phosphatidylinositol diacylglycerol-lyase      Phosphatidylinositol diacylglycerol-lyase   (Figure)  500|Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C , image from OPM database   In enzymology , a phosphatidylinositol diacylglycerol-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1D-myo-inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate + 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol , and two products , 1D-myo-inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate and 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the class of phosphorus-oxygen lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol-lyase (1D-myo-inositol-1,2-cyclic-phosphate-forming) . Other names in common use include monophosphatidylinositol phosphodiesterase , phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C , 1-phosphatidylinositol phosphodiesterase , 1-phosphatidyl-D-myo-inositol inositolphosphohydrolase , (cyclic-phosphate-forming) , 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol diacylglycerol-lyase , and (1,2-cyclic-phosphate-forming) . This enzyme participates in inositol phosphate metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
