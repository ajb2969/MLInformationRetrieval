Anonymous veto network

In cryptography, the anonymous veto network (or AV-net) is a multi-party secure computation protocol to compute the boolean-OR function.1 It presents an efficient solution to the Dining cryptographers problem.
Description
All participants agree on a group 
 
 
 
  with a generator 
 
 
 
  of prime order 
 
 
 
  in which the discrete logarithm problem is hard. For example, a Schnorr group can be used. For a group of 
 
 
 
  participants, the protocol executes in two rounds.
Round 1: each participant 
 
 
 
  selects a random value 
 
 
 
  and publishes the ephemeral public key 
 
 
 
  together with a zero-knowledge proof for the proof of the exponent 
 
 
 
 . A detailed description of a method for such proofs is found in the article Fiat-Shamir heuristic.
After this round, each participant computes:



Round 2: each participant 
 
 
 
  publishes 
 
 
 
  and a zero-knowledge proof for the proof of the exponent 
 
 
 
 . Here, the participants chose 
 
 
 
  if they want to send a "0" bit (no veto), or a random value if they want to send a "1" bit (veto).
After round 2, each participant computes 
 
 
 
 . If no one vetoed, each will obtain 
 
 
 
 . On the other hand, if one or more participants vetoed, each will have 
 
 
 
 .
The protocol design
The protocol is designed by combining random public keys in such a structured way to achieve a vanishing effect. In this case, 
 
 
 
 . For example, if there are three participants, then $\scriptstyle x_1 \cdot y_1 \,+\, x_1 \cdot y_2 \,+\, x_3 \cdot y_3 \;=\; x_1 \cdot (-x_2 \,-\, x_3) \,+\, x_2 \cdot (x_1 \,-\, x_3) \,+\, x_3 \cdot (x_1 \,+\, x_2) \;=\; 0$. A similar idea, though in a non-public-key context, can be traced back to David Chaum's original solution to the Dining cryptographers problem.2
