   Whittaker model      Whittaker model   In representation theory , a branch of mathematics, the Whittaker model is a realization of a representation of a reductive algebraic group such as GL 2 over a finite or local or global field on a space of functions on the group. It is named after E. T. Whittaker even though he never worked in this area, because  pointed out that for the group SL 2 ( R ) some of the functions involved in the representation are Whittaker functions .  Irreducible representations without a Whittaker model are sometimes called "degenerate", and those with a Whittaker model are sometimes called "generic". The representation θ 10 of the symplectic group Sp 4 is the simplest example of a degenerate representation.  Whittaker models for GL 2  If G is the algebraic group  GL 2 and F is a local field, and τ is a fixed non-trivial character of the additive group of F and π is an irreducible representation of a general linear group G ( F ), then the Whittaker model for π is a representation π on a space of functions f on G ( F ) satisfying        f   (    (     1    b      0    1     )   g   )    =   τ   (  b  )   f   (  g  )     .        f      1  b    0  1    g      τ  b  f  g     f\left(\begin{pmatrix}1&b\\
 0&1\end{pmatrix}g\right)=\tau(b)f(g).   used Whittaker models to assign L-functions to admissible representations of GL 2 .  Whittaker models for GL n  Let   G   G   G   be the general linear group     GL  n     subscript  GL  n    {\rm GL}_{n}   ,   ψ   ψ   \psi   a smooth complex valued non-trivial additive character of   F   F   F   and   U   U   U   the subgroup of    GL  n     subscript  GL  n    {\rm GL}_{n}   consisting of unipotent upper triangular matrices. A non-degenerate character on   U   U   U   is of the form        χ   (  u  )    =   ψ   (     α  1    x  12    +    α  2    x  23    +  ⋯  +    α   n  -  1     x   n  -   1  n       )     ,        χ  u     ψ       subscript  α  1    subscript  x  12       subscript  α  2    subscript  x  23    normal-⋯     subscript  α    n  1     subscript  x    n    1  n          \chi(u)=\psi(\alpha_{1}x_{12}+\alpha_{2}x_{23}+\cdots+\alpha_{n-1}x_{n-1n}),     for    u  =   (   x   i  j    )       u   subscript  x    i  j      u=(x_{ij})   ∈   U   U   U   and non-zero    α  1     subscript  α  1    \alpha_{1}   , ...,    α   n  -  1      subscript  α    n  1     \alpha_{n-1}   ∈   F   F   F   . If    (  π  ,  V  )     π  V    (\pi,V)   is a smooth representation of    G   (  F  )       G  F    G(F)   , a Whittaker functional    λ   λ   \lambda   is a continuous linear functional on   V   V   V   such that     λ   (   π   (  u  )   v   )    =   χ   (  u  )   λ   (  v  )          λ    π  u  v      χ  u  λ  v     \lambda(\pi(u)v)=\chi(u)\lambda(v)   for all   u   u   u   ∈   U   U   U   ,   v   v   v   ∈   V   V   V   . Multiplicity one states that, for   π   π   \pi   unitary irreducible, the space of Whittaker functionals has dimension at most equal to one.  Whittaker models for reductive groups  If G is a split reductive group and U is the unipotent radical of a Borel subgroup B , then a Whittaker model for a representation is an embedding of it into the induced ( Gelfand–Graev ) representation Ind(χ), where χ is a non-degenerate character of U , such as the sum of the characters corresponding to simple roots.  See also   Gelfand–Graev representation , roughly the sum of Whittaker models over a finite field.  Kirillov model   References        J. A.
