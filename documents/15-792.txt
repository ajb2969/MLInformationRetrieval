D-arabitol-phosphate dehydrogenase

D-arabitol-phosphate dehydrogenase (, APDH, D-arabitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase, D-arabitol 5-phosphate dehydrogenase) is an enzyme with system name D-arabitol-phosphate:NAD+ oxidoreductase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

D-arabitol 1-phosphate + NAD+

 
  D-xylulose 5-phosphate + NADH + H+


This enzyme participates in arabitol catabolism. The enzyme also converts D-arabitol 5-phosphate to D-ribulose 5-phosphate at a lower rate.
