   Furstenberg's proof of the infinitude of primes      Furstenberg's proof of the infinitude of primes   In number theory , Hillel Furstenberg 's proof of the infinitude of primes is a celebrated topological  proof that the integers contain infinitely many prime numbers . When examined closely, the proof is less a statement about topology than a statement about certain properties of arithmetic sequences . 1 Unlike Euclid's classical proof , Furstenberg's proof is a proof by contradiction . The proof was published in 1955 in the American Mathematical Monthly while Furstenberg was still an undergraduate student at Yeshiva University .  Furstenberg's proof  Define a topology on the integers Z , called the evenly spaced integer topology , by declaring a subset U ⊆ Z to be an open set  if and only if it is either the empty set , ∅, or it is a union of arithmetic sequences S ( a , b ) (for a ≠ 0), where        S   (  a  ,  b  )    =   {    a  n   +  b   ∣   n  ∈  ℤ   }   =    a  ℤ   +  b    .          S   a  b     conditional-set      a  n   b     n  ℤ             a  ℤ   b      S(a,b)=\{an+b\mid n\in\mathbb{Z}\}=a\mathbb{Z}+b.\,     In other words, U is open if and only if every x ∈ U admits some non-zero integer a such that S ( a , x ) ⊆ U . The axioms for a topology are easily verified:   By definition, ∅ is open; Z is just the sequence S (1, 0), and so is open as well.  Any union of open sets is open: for any collection of open sets U i and x in their union U , any of the numbers a i for which S ( a i , x ) ⊆ U i also shows that S ( a i , x ) ⊆ U .  The intersection of two (and hence finitely many) open sets is open: let U 1 and U 2 be open sets and let x ∈ U 1 ∩ U 2 (with numbers a 1 and a 2 establishing membership). Set a to be the lowest common multiple of a 1 and a 2 . Then S ( a , x ) ⊆ S ( a i , x ) ⊆ U i .   This topology has two notable properties:   Since any non-empty open set contains an infinite sequence, a finite set cannot be open; put another way, the complement of a finite set cannot be a closed set .  The basis sets S ( a , b ) are both open and closed : they are open by definition, and we can write S ( a , b ) as the complement of an open set as follows:           S   (  a  ,  b  )    =   ℤ  ∖    ⋃   j  =  1    a  -  1     S   (  a  ,   b  +  j   )       .        S   a  b      ℤ    superscript   subscript     j  1      a  1      S   a    b  j         S(a,b)=\mathbb{Z}\setminus\bigcup_{j=1}^{a-1}S(a,b+j).        The only integers that are not integer multiples of prime numbers are −1 and +1, i.e.          ℤ  ∖   {   -  1   ,   +  1   }    =    ⋃    p   prime     S   (  p  ,  0  )      .        ℤ     1     1       subscript     p  prime      S   p  0       \mathbb{Z}\setminus\{-1,+1\}=\bigcup_{p\mathrm{\,prime}}S(p,0).        By the first property, the set on the left-hand side cannot be closed. On the other hand, by the second property, the sets S ( p , 0) are closed. So, if there were only finitely many prime numbers, then the set on the right-hand side would be a finite union of closed sets, and hence closed. This would be a contradiction , so there must be infinitely many prime numbers.
