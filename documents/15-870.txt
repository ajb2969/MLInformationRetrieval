Beta-apo-4'-carotenal oxygenase

Beta-apo-4'-carotenal oxygenase (, beta-apo-4'-carotenal dehydrogenase, YLO-1, carD (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 4'-apo-beta,psi-carotenal:NAD+ oxidoreductase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

4'-apo-beta,psi-caroten-4'-al + NAD+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  neurosporaxanthin + NADH + 2 H+


Neurosporaxanthin is responsible for the orange color of Neurospora.
