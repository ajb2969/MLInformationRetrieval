Almost linear hash function

An almost linear function is a function h such that, for every inputs x and y, one of the following two equations hold:






 
 .

If equation 1 always holds, then h is a linear function. But if in some cases equation 2 holds, then h is almost linear.
The almost-linearity concept is mainly used with hash functions. A hash function can be used to map a large domain (e.g. the numbers between 0 and ) to a much smaller domain (e.g. the numbers between 0 and , where ). It is easy to create a linear hash function, e.g. for every constant a, the following function is linear:



However, this family of functions is missing some other features that are required from a hash function, e.g. it is not universal. In contrast, the following function is both universal and almost linear, for every odd constant a and for every M, m which are powers of 2:12


 
  where 
 
 
 
  means integer division (taking only the integral part of the result and discarding the remainder).
For example, if ,  and :



For every x, y:









Hence, if 
 
 
 
 , then it is discarded in the integer division by 4, and we get:



The only other option is that 
 
 
 
 . In this case, dividing it by 4 gives an integer part of 1, and we get:



This proves that h is an almost-linear function.
