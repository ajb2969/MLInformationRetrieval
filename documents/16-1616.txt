   Almost linear hash function      Almost linear hash function   An almost linear function is a function h such that, for every inputs x and y , one of the following two equations hold:        h   (   x  +  y   )    =    h   (  x  )    +   h   (  y  )           h    x  y        h  x     h  y      h(x+y)=h(x)+h(y)          h   (   x  +  y   )    =    h   (  x  )    +   h   (  y  )    +  1         h    x  y        h  x     h  y   1     h(x+y)=h(x)+h(y)+1   .   If equation 1 always holds, then h is a linear function . But if in some cases equation 2 holds, then h is almost linear.  The almost-linearity concept is mainly used with hash functions . A hash function can be used to map a large domain (e.g. the numbers between 0 and ) to a much smaller domain (e.g. the numbers between 0 and , where ). It is easy to create a linear hash function, e.g. for every constant a , the following function is linear:       h   (  x  )    =    a  x   mod  m         h  x    modulo    a  x   m     h(x)=ax\bmod m     However, this family of functions is missing some other features that are required from a hash function, e.g. it is not universal . In contrast, the following function is both universal and almost linear, for every odd constant a and for every M , m which are powers of 2: 1 2       h   (  x  )    =    (    a  x   mod  M   )   ÷   (   M  /  m   )          h  x      modulo    a  x   M     M  m      h(x)=(ax\mod M)\div(M/m)   where   ÷     \div   means integer division (taking only the integral part of the result and discarding the remainder).  For example, if ,  and :       h   (  x  )    =    (   x  mod  64   )   ÷  4         h  x      modulo  x  64   4     h(x)=(x\bmod 64)\div 4     For every x , y :      x  =     4   (   x  ÷  4   )    +  x   mod  4       x   modulo      4    x  4    x   4     x=4(x\div 4)+x\bmod 4         y  =     4   (   y  ÷  4   )    +  y   mod  4       y   modulo      4    y  4    y   4     y=4(y\div 4)+y\bmod 4          x  +  y   =    4   (    x  ÷  4   +   y  ÷  4    )    +   (   x  mod  4   )   +   (   y  mod  4   )          x  y       4      x  4     y  4      modulo  x  4    modulo  y  4      x+y=4(x\div 4+y\div 4)+(x\bmod 4)+(y\bmod 4)     Hence, if      (   x  mod  4   )   +   (   y  mod  4   )    <  4         modulo  x  4    modulo  y  4    4    (x\bmod 4)+(y\bmod 4)<4   , then it is discarded in the integer division by 4, and we get:       h   (   x  +  y   )    =    x  ÷  4   +   y  ÷  4    =    h   (  x  )    +   h   (  y  )             h    x  y        x  4     y  4             h  x     h  y       h(x+y)=x\div 4+y\div 4=h(x)+h(y)     The only other option is that    4  ≤    (   x  mod  4   )   +   (   y  mod  4   )    <  8        4     modulo  x  4    modulo  y  4         8     4\leq(x\bmod 4)+(y\bmod 4)<8   . In this case, dividing it by 4 gives an integer part of 1, and we get:       h   (   x  +  y   )    =    x  ÷  4   +   y  ÷  4   +  1   =    h   (  x  )    +   h   (  y  )    +  1           h    x  y        x  4     y  4   1            h  x     h  y   1      h(x+y)=x\div 4+y\div 4+1=h(x)+h(y)+1     This proves that h is an almost-linear function.
