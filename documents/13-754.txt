Method of continuity

In the mathematics of Banach spaces, the method of continuity provides sufficient conditions for deducing the invertibility of one bounded linear operator from that of another, related operator.
Formulation
Let B be a Banach space, V a normed vector space, and 
 
 
 
  a norm continuous family of bounded linear operators from B into V. Assume that there exists a constant C such that for every 
 
 
 
  and every 
 
 



 
  Then 
 
 
 
  is surjective if and only if 
 
 
 
  is surjective as well.
Applications
The method of continuity is used in conjunction with a priori estimates to prove the existence of suitably regular solutions to elliptic partial differential equations.
Proof
We assume that 
 
 
 
  is surjective and show that 
 
 
 
  is surjective as well.
Subdividing the interval [0,1] we may assume that 
 
 
 
 . Furthermore, the surjectivity of 
 
 
 
  implies that V is isomorphic to B and thus a Banach space. The hypothesis implies that 
 
 
 
  is a closed subspace.
Assume that 
 
 
 
  is a proper subspace. The Hahnâ€“Banach theorem shows that there exists a 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Now 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  by the hypothesis. Therefore


 
  which is a contradiction since
