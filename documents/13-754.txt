   Method of continuity      Method of continuity   In the mathematics of Banach spaces , the method of continuity provides sufficient conditions for deducing the invertibility of one bounded linear operator from that of another, related operator.  Formulation  Let B be a Banach space , V a normed vector space , and     (   L  t   )    t  ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]       subscript   subscript  L  t     t   0  1      (L_{t})_{t\in[0,1]}   a norm continuous family of bounded linear operators from B into V . Assume that there exists a constant C such that for every    t  ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]       t   0  1     t\in[0,1]   and every    x  ∈  B      x  B    x\in B            ||  x  ||   B   ≤   C    ||    L  t    (  x  )    ||   V     .       subscript   norm  x   B     C   subscript   norm     subscript  L  t   x    V      ||x||_{B}\leq C||L_{t}(x)||_{V}.   Then    L  0     subscript  L  0    L_{0}   is surjective if and only if    L  1     subscript  L  1    L_{1}   is surjective as well.  Applications  The method of continuity is used in conjunction with a priori estimates to prove the existence of suitably regular solutions to elliptic  partial differential equations .  Proof  We assume that    L  0     subscript  L  0    L_{0}   is surjective and show that    L  1     subscript  L  1    L_{1}   is surjective as well.  Subdividing the interval [0,1] we may assume that     ||    L  0   -   L  1    ||   ≤   1  /   (   3  C   )         norm     subscript  L  0    subscript  L  1       1    3  C      ||L_{0}-L_{1}||\leq 1/(3C)   . Furthermore, the surjectivity of    L  0     subscript  L  0    L_{0}   implies that V is isomorphic to B and thus a Banach space. The hypothesis implies that      L  1    (  B  )    ⊆  V         subscript  L  1   B   V    L_{1}(B)\subseteq V   is a closed subspace.  Assume that      L  1    (  B  )    ⊆  V         subscript  L  1   B   V    L_{1}(B)\subseteq V   is a proper subspace. The Hahn–Banach theorem shows that there exists a    y  ∈  V      y  V    y\in V   such that      ||  y  ||   V   ≤  1       subscript   norm  y   V   1    ||y||_{V}\leq 1   and     dist   (  y  ,    L  1    (  B  )    )    >   2  /  3         dist   y     subscript  L  1   B       2  3     \mathrm{dist}(y,L_{1}(B))>2/3   . Now    y  =    L  0    (  x  )        y     subscript  L  0   x     y=L_{0}(x)   for some    x  ∈  B      x  B    x\in B   and      ||  x  ||   B   ≤   C    ||  y  ||   V         subscript   norm  x   B     C   subscript   norm  y   V      ||x||_{B}\leq C||y||_{V}   by the hypothesis. Therefore         ||   y  -    L  1    (  x  )     ||   V   =    ||    (    L  0   -   L  1    )    (  x  )    ||   V   ≤    ||    L  0   -   L  1    ||     ||  x  ||   B    ≤   1  /  3    ,         subscript   norm    y     subscript  L  1   x     V    subscript   norm       subscript  L  0    subscript  L  1    x    V           norm     subscript  L  0    subscript  L  1      subscript   norm  x   B           1  3      ||y-L_{1}(x)||_{V}=||(L_{0}-L_{1})(x)||_{V}\leq||L_{0}-L_{1}||||x||_{B}\leq 1/3,   which is a contradiction since      L  1    (  x  )    ∈    L  1    (  B  )           subscript  L  1   x      subscript  L  1   B     L_{1}(x)\in L_{1}(B)   .
