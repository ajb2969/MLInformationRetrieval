Order of accuracy

In numerical analysis, order of accuracy quantifies the rate of convergence of a numerical approximation of a differential equation to the exact solution. A numerical solution to a differential equation is said to be 

 
 th-order accurate if the error, 
 
 
 
 , is proportional to the step-size 
 
 
 
  to the 
 
 
 
 th power;1



The size of the error of a first-order accurate approximation is directly proportional to 
 
 
 
 . In big O notation, an 
 
 
 
 th-order accurate numerical method is notated as 
 
 
 
 . Partial differential equations which vary over both time and space are said to be accurate to order 
 
 
 
  in time and to order 
 
 
 
 
  in space.2
