   Order of accuracy      Order of accuracy   In numerical analysis , order of accuracy quantifies the rate of convergence of a numerical approximation of a differential equation to the exact solution. A numerical solution to a differential equation is said to be    n   n   n   th-order accurate if the error,   E   E   E   , is proportional to the step-size   h   h   h   to the   n   n   n   th power; 1       E   (  h  )    =   C   h  n          E  h     C   superscript  h  n      E(h)=Ch^{n}     The size of the error of a first-order accurate approximation is directly proportional to   h   h   h   . In big O notation , an   n   n   n   th-order accurate numerical method is notated as    O   (   h  n   )       O   superscript  h  n     O(h^{n})   . Partial differential equations which vary over both time and space are said to be accurate to order   n   n   n   in time and to order   m   m   m   in space. 2  References  "  Category:Numerical analysis     ↩  ↩
