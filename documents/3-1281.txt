   Riemann–Hurwitz formula      Riemann–Hurwitz formula   In mathematics , the Riemann–Hurwitz formula , named after Bernhard Riemann and Adolf Hurwitz , describes the relationship of the Euler characteristics of two surfaces when one is a ramified covering of the other. It therefore connects ramification with algebraic topology , in this case. It is a prototype result for many others, and is often applied in the theory of Riemann surfaces (which is its origin) and algebraic curves .  Statement  For an orientable surface S the Euler characteristic χ( S ) is      2  -   2   g        2    2  g     2-2g\,     where g is the genus (the number of handles ), since the Betti numbers are 1, 2 g , 1, 0, 0, ... . In the case of an ( unramified ) covering map of surfaces      π  :    S  ′   →   S       normal-:  π   normal-→   superscript  S  normal-′   S     \pi:S^{\prime}\to S\,     that is surjective and of degree N , we should have the formula        χ   (   S  ′   )    =    N  ⋅  χ    (  S  )     .        χ   superscript  S  normal-′       normal-⋅  N  χ   S     \chi(S^{\prime})=N\cdot\chi(S).\,     That is because each simplex of S should be covered by exactly N in S ′ — at least if we use a fine enough triangulation of S , as we are entitled to do since the Euler characteristic is a topological invariant . What the Riemann–Hurwitz formula does is to add in a correction to allow for ramification ( sheets coming together ).  Now assume that S and S′ are Riemann surfaces , and that the map π is complex analytic . The map π is said to be ramified at a point P in S ′ if there exist analytic coordinates near P and π( P ) such that π takes the form π( z ) = z n , and n > 1. An equivalent way of thinking about this is that there exists a small neighborhood U of P such that π( P ) has exactly one preimage in U , but the image of any other point in U has exactly n preimages in U . The number n is called the ramification index at P and also denoted by e P . In calculating the Euler characteristic of S ′ we notice the loss of e P − 1 copies of P above π( P ) (that is, in the inverse image of π( P )). Now let us choose triangulations of S and S′ with vertices at the branch and ramification points, respectively, and use these to compute the Euler characteristics. Then S′ will have the same number of d -dimensional faces for d different from zero, but fewer than expected vertices. Therefore we find a "corrected" formula       χ   (   S  ′   )    =     N  ⋅  χ    (  S  )    -    ∑   P  ∈   S  ′      (    e  P   -  1   )           χ   superscript  S  normal-′         normal-⋅  N  χ   S     subscript     P   superscript  S  normal-′        subscript  e  P   1       \chi(S^{\prime})=N\cdot\chi(S)-\sum_{P\in S^{\prime}}(e_{P}-1)     (all but finitely many P have e P = 1, so this is quite safe). This formula is known as the Riemann–Hurwitz formula and also as Hurwitz's theorem .  Examples  The Weierstrass   ℘   Weierstrass-p   \wp   -function , considered as a meromorphic function with values in the Riemann sphere , yields a map from an elliptic curve (genus 1) to the projective line (genus 0). It is a double cover ( N = 2), with ramification at four points only, at which e = 2. The Riemann–Hurwitz formula then reads      0  =    2  ⋅  2   -   Σ  1        0     normal-⋅  2  2     normal-Σ  1      0=2\cdot 2-\Sigma\ 1     with the summation taken over four values of P .  The formula may also be used to calculate the genus of hyperelliptic curves .  As another example, the Riemann sphere maps to itself by the function z n , which has ramification index n at 0, for any integer n > 1. There can only be other ramification at the point at infinity. In order to balance the equation      2  =    n  ⋅  2   -   (   n  -  1   )   -   (    e  ∞   -  1   )        2     normal-⋅  n  2     n  1      subscript  e    1      2=n\cdot 2-(n-1)-(e_{\infty}-1)     we must have ramification index n at infinity, also.  Consequences  Several results in algebraic topology and complex analysis follow.  Firstly, there are no ramified covering maps from a curve of lower genus to a curve of higher genus – and thus, since non-constant meromorphic maps of curves are ramified covering spaces, there are no non-constant meromorphic maps from a curve of lower genus to a curve of higher genus.  As another example, it shows immediately that a curve of genus 0 has no cover with N > 1 that is unramified everywhere: because that would give rise to an Euler characteristic > 2.  Generalizations  For a correspondence of curves, there is a more general formula, Zeuthen's theorem , which gives the ramification correction to the first approximation that the Euler characteristics are in the inverse ratio to the degrees of the correspondence.  An orbifold covering of degree N between orbifold surfaces S' and S is a branched covering, so the Riemann–Hurwitz formula implies the usual formula for coverings       χ   (   S  ′   )    =    N  ⋅  χ    (  S  )          χ   superscript  S  normal-′       normal-⋅  N  χ   S     \chi(S^{\prime})=N\cdot\chi(S)\,   denoting with    χ    χ   \chi\,   the orbifold Euler characteristic.
