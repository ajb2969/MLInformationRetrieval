Elliptic gamma function

In mathematics, the elliptic gamma function is a generalization of the q-Gamma function, which is itself the q-analog of the ordinary Gamma function. It is closely related to a function studied by , and can be expressed in terms of the triple gamma function. It is given by



It obeys several identities:






and



where Î¸ is the q-theta function.
When 
 
 
 
 , it essentially reduces to the infinite q-Pochhammer symbol:
