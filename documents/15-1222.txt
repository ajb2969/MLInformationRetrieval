Arsenite methyltransferase

Arsenite methyltransferase (, S-adenosyl-L-methionine:arsenic(III) methyltransferase, S-adenosyl-L-methionine:methylarsonite As-methyltransferase, methylarsonite methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:arsenite As-methyltransferase.12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + arsenite

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + methylarsonate

(2) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + methylarsonite 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + dimethylarsinate


An enzyme of the biotransformation pathway that forms dimethylarsinate from inorganic arsenite and arsenate.
