   Sinapoylglucose—sinapoylglucose O-sinapoyltransferase      Sinapoylglucose—sinapoylglucose O-sinapoyltransferase   In enzymology , a sinapoylglucose---sinapoylglucose O-sinapoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 1-O-sinapoyl beta-D-glucoside   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucose + 1,2-bis-O-sinapoyl beta-D-glucoside   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 1-O-sinapoyl beta-D-glucoside , and two products , D-glucose and 1,2-bis-O-sinapoyl beta-D-glucoside .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-O-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxycinnamoyl)-beta-D-glucoside:1-O-(4-hydro xy-3,5-dimethoxycinnamoyl-beta-D-glucoside 1-O-sinapoyltransferase . Other names in common use include hydroxycinnamoylglucose-hydroxycinnamoylglucose , hydroxycinnamoyltransferase , 1-(hydroxycinnamoyl)-glucose:1-(hydroxycinnamoyl)-glucose , and hydroxycinnamoyltransferase .
