   Ono's inequality      Ono's inequality   In mathematics , Ono's inequality is a theorem about triangles in the Euclidean plane . In its original form, as conjectured by T. Ono in 1914, the inequality is actually false; however, the statement is true for acute triangles and right triangles , as shown by Balitrand in 1916.  Statement of the inequality  Consider an acute or right triangle in the Euclidean plane with side lengths a , b and c and area A . Then        27    (     b  2   +   c  2    -   a  2    )   2     (     c  2   +   a  2    -   b  2    )   2     (     a  2   +   b  2    -   c  2    )   2    â‰¤    (   4  A   )   6    .        27   superscript       superscript  b  2    superscript  c  2     superscript  a  2    2    superscript       superscript  c  2    superscript  a  2     superscript  b  2    2    superscript       superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2     superscript  c  2    2     superscript    4  A   6     27(b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2})^{2}(c^{2}+a^{2}-b^{2})^{2}(a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2})^{2}\leq(4A%
 )^{6}.     This inequality fails for general triangles (to which Ono's original conjecture applied), as shown by the counterexample      a  =  2   ,    b  =  3   ,    c  =  4   ,   A  =    3   15    /  4.         formulae-sequence    a  2    formulae-sequence    b  3    formulae-sequence    c  4     A      3    15    4.        a=2,\,\,b=3,\,\,c=4,\,\,A=3\sqrt{15}/4.     The inequality holds with equality in the case of an equilateral triangle , in which up to similarity we have sides    1  ,  1  ,  1     1  1  1    1,1,1   and area     3   /  4.        3   4.    \sqrt{3}/4.
