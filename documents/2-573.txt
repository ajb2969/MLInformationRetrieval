   Vorticity equation      Vorticity equation   The vorticity equation of fluid dynamics describes evolution of the vorticity of a particle of a fluid as it moves with its flow , that is, the local rotation of the fluid (in terms of vector calculus this is the curl of the flow velocity ). The equation is:        D   ω  →     D  t          D   normal-→  ω      D  t     \displaystyle\frac{D\vec{\omega}}{Dt}     where d / dt the total time derivative operator, also denoted by in capital D notation as D / Dt ,  is the flow velocity , ρ is the local fluid density , p is the local pressure , τ is the viscous stress tensor and  represents the sum of the external body forces . The first source term on the right hand side represents vortex stretching . The equation is valid in the absence of any concentrated torques and line forces, for a compressible Newtonian fluid .  In the case of incompressible (i.e. low Mach number ) and isotropic fluids, with conservative body forces, the equation simplifies to the vorticity transport equation        d   ω  →     d  t    =     (    ω  →   ⋅  ∇   )    v  →    +   ν    ∇  2    ω  →              d   normal-→  ω      d  t         normal-⋅   normal-→  ω   normal-∇    normal-→  v      ν    superscript  normal-∇  2    normal-→  ω        {d\vec{\omega}\over dt}=(\vec{\omega}\cdot\nabla)\vec{v}+\nu\nabla^{2}\vec{\omega}   where ν is the kinematic viscosity and ∇ 2 is the Laplace operator .  Physical Interpretation   The term d/dt on the left-hand side is the material derivative of the vorticity vector . It describes the rate of change of vorticity (that is, the angular acceleration ) of the fluid particle. This change can be attributed to unsteadiness in the flow (∂/∂ t , the unsteady term ) or due to the motion of the fluid particle as it moves from one point to another ( ∙ (), the convection term ).    The term (∙ )  on the right-hand side describes the stretching or tilting of vorticity due to the flow velocity gradients. Note that  is an order-2 tensor with nine components.    The term ( ∙ ) describes stretching of vorticity due to flow compressibility. It follows from the Navier-Stokes equation for continuity ,namely            ∂  ρ    ∂  t    +   ∇  ⋅   (   ρ   u  →    )     =  0            ρ     t     normal-⋅  normal-∇    ρ   normal-→  u      0    \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\rho\vec{u})=0       or      ∇  ⋅   u  →    =   -    1  ρ     d  ρ    d  t      =    1  v     d  v    d  t            normal-⋅  normal-∇   normal-→  u          1  ρ       d  ρ     d  t               1  v       d  v     d  t        \nabla\cdot\vec{u}=-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{d\rho}{dt}=\frac{1}{v}\frac{dv}{dt}      where v = 1/ ρ is the specific volume of the fluid element. One can think of  ∙  as a measure of flow compressibility. Sometimes the negative sign is included in the term.    The term (1/ ρ 2 ) ρ × p is the baroclinic term . It accounts for the changes in the vorticity due to the intersection of density and pressure surfaces.    The term  × ( ∙ τ / ρ ), accounts for the diffusion of vorticity due to the viscous effects.    The term  ×  provides for changes due to external body forces. These are forces that are spread over a three-dimensional region of the fluid, such as gravity or electromagnetic forces . (As opposed to forces that act only over a surface (like drag on a wall) or a line (like surface tension around a meniscus ).   Simplifications   In case of conservative body forces ,  ×  = 0.  For a barotropic fluid , ρ × p = 0. This is also true for a constant density fluid (including incompressible fluid) where ρ = 0. Note that this is not the same as an incompressible flow , for which the barotropic term cannot be neglected.  For inviscid fluids, the viscosity tensor τ is zero.   Thus for an inviscid, barotropic fluid with conservative body forces, the vorticity equation simplifies to        d   d  t     (    ω  →   ρ   )    =    (    ω  →   ρ   )   ⋅   ∇   u  →             d    d  t       normal-→  ω   ρ     normal-⋅     normal-→  ω   ρ    normal-∇   normal-→  u       \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\vec{\omega}}{\rho}\right)=\left(\frac{\vec{\omega}}{%
 \rho}\right)\cdot\nabla\vec{u}   Alternately, in case of incompressible, inviscid fluid with conservative body forces,        d   ω  →     d  t    =    (    ω  →   ⋅  ∇   )    u  →            d   normal-→  ω      d  t       normal-⋅   normal-→  ω   normal-∇    normal-→  u      \frac{d\vec{\omega}}{dt}=(\vec{\omega}\cdot\nabla)\vec{u}     For a brief review of additional cases and simplifications, see also. 1  Derivation  The vorticity equation can be derived from the Navier-Stokes equation for the conservation of angular momentum . In the absence of any concentrated torques and line forces, one obtains        d   u  →     d  t    =     ∂   u  →     ∂  t    +    (    u  →   ⋅  ∇   )    u  →     =    -    1  ρ    ∇  p     +   B  →   +    ∇  ⋅  τ   ρ              d   normal-→  u      d  t           normal-→  u      t       normal-⋅   normal-→  u   normal-∇    normal-→  u                  1  ρ    normal-∇  p      normal-→  B      normal-⋅  normal-∇  τ   ρ       \frac{d\vec{u}}{dt}=\frac{\partial\vec{u}}{\partial t}+(\vec{u}\cdot\nabla)%
 \vec{u}=-\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p+\vec{B}+\frac{\nabla\cdot\tau}{\rho}     Now, vorticity is defined as the curl of the flow velocity vector. Taking curl of momentum equation yields the desired equation.
