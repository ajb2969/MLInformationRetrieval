   Citrate (Re)-synthase      Citrate (Re)-synthase   In enzymology , a citrate (Re)-synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + H 2 O + oxaloacetate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   citrate + CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA , H 2 O , and oxaloacetate , whereas its two products are citrate and CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases that convert acyl groups into alkyl groups on transfer. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:oxaloacetate C-acetyltransferase [thioester-hydrolysing, (pro-R)-carboxymethyl-forming] . Other names in common use include (R)-citrate synthase , Re-citrate-synthase , and citrate oxaloacetate-lyase [(pro-3R)-CH2COO-->acetyl-CoA] .
