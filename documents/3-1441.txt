   Protonation      Protonation   In chemistry, protonation is the addition of a proton (H + ) to an atom , molecule , or ion , forming the conjugate acid . 1 Some examples include   the protonation of water by sulfuric acid :          H  2     SO  4     +    H  2    O     ⇌     H  3     O  +     +   HSO  4  -       normal-⇌       subscript  normal-H  2    subscript  SO  4       subscript  normal-H  2   normal-O         subscript  normal-H  3    superscript  normal-O      superscript   subscript  HSO  4        \mathrm{H_{2}SO_{4}\ +\ H_{2}O\ \rightleftharpoons\ H_{3}O^{+}\ +\ HSO_{4}^{-}}      the protonation of isobutene in the formation of a carbocation :         (   CH  3   )   2   C       subscript   subscript  CH  3   2   normal-C    \mathrm{(CH_{3})_{2}C}   =       CH  2    +    HBF  4     ⇌      (   CH  3   )   3     C  +     +   BF  4  -       normal-⇌     subscript  CH  2    subscript  HBF  4         subscript   subscript  CH  3   3    superscript  normal-C      superscript   subscript  BF  4        \mathrm{CH_{2}\ +\ HBF_{4}\ \rightleftharpoons\ (CH_{3})_{3}C^{+}\ +\ BF_{4}^{%

Some ions and molecules can undergo more than one protonation and are labeled polybasic, which is true of many biological macromolecules . Protonation and deprotonation occur in most acid-base reactions ; they are the core of most acid-base reaction theories. A Bronsted-Lowry acid is defined as a chemical substance that protonates another substance. Upon protonating a substrate, the mass and the charge of the species each increase by one unit. Protonating or deprotonating a molecule or ion alters many chemical properties beyond the change in the charge and mass: hydrophilicity , reduction potential , optical properties , among others. Protonation is also an essential step in certain analytical procedures such as electrospray mass spectrometry .  Rates of protonation and deprotonation  Protonations are often rapid, in part because of the high mobility of protons in water. The rate of protonation is related to the acidity of the protonating species, in that protonation by weak acids is slower than protonation of the same base by strong acids . The rates of protonation and deprotonation can be especially slow when protonation induces significant structural changes. 2  Reversibility and catalysis  Usually, protonations are reversible and the conjugate base is unchanged by being protonated. In some cases protonation induces isomerization , however. Cis- alkenes can be converted to trans-alkenes using a catalytic amount of protonating agent. Many enzymes, such as the serine hydrolases , operate by mechanisms that involve reversible protonations of substrates.
