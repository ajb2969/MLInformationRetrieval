   Uniform boundedness principle      Uniform boundedness principle   In mathematics , the uniform boundedness principle or Banach–Steinhaus theorem is one of the fundamental results in functional analysis . Together with the Hahn–Banach theorem and the open mapping theorem , it is considered one of the cornerstones of the field. In its basic form, it asserts that for a family of continuous linear operators (and thus bounded operators) whose domain is a Banach space , pointwise boundedness is equivalent to uniform boundedness in operator norm.  The theorem was first published in 1927 by Stefan Banach and Hugo Steinhaus but it was also proven independently by Hans Hahn .  Theorem  Theorem (Uniform Boundedness Principle). Let X be a Banach space and Y be a normed vector space . Suppose that F is a collection of continuous linear operators from X to Y . If for all x in X one has         sup   T  ∈  F      ∥   T   (  x  )    ∥   Y    <  ∞   ,        subscript  supremum    T  F     subscript   norm    T  x    Y       \sup\nolimits_{T\in F}\|T(x)\|_{Y}<\infty,     then         sup    T  ∈  F   ,    ∥  x  ∥   =  1       ∥   T   (  x  )    ∥   Y    =    sup   T  ∈  F      ∥  T  ∥    B   (  X  ,  Y  )      <  ∞   .          subscript  supremum   formulae-sequence    T  F      norm  x   1      subscript   norm    T  x    Y      subscript  supremum    T  F     subscript   norm  T     B   X  Y               \sup\nolimits_{T\in F,\|x\|=1}\|T(x)\|_{Y}=\sup\nolimits_{T\in F}\|T\|_{B(X,Y)%
 }<\infty.     Proof  The completeness of X enables the following short proof, using the Baire category theorem .  Proof. Suppose that for every x in the Banach space X , one has:         sup   T  ∈  F      ∥   T   (  x  )    ∥   Y    <  ∞   .        subscript  supremum    T  F     subscript   norm    T  x    Y       \sup\nolimits_{T\in F}\|T(x)\|_{Y}<\infty.     For every integer    n  ∈  ℕ      n  ℕ    n\in\mathbb{N}   , let        X  n   =   {   x  ∈   X    :     sup   T  ∈  F      ∥   T   (  x  )    ∥   Y    ≤  n   }    .       subscript  X  n    conditional-set    x  X       subscript  supremum    T  F     subscript   norm    T  x    Y    n      X_{n}=\left\{x\in X\ :\ \sup\nolimits_{T\in F}\|T(x)\|_{Y}\leq n\right\}.     The set    X  n     subscript  X  n    X_{n}   is a closed set and by the assumption,         ⋃   n  ∈  𝐍     X  n    =  X  ≠  ∅   .          subscript     n  𝐍     subscript  X  n    X           \bigcup\nolimits_{n\in\mathbf{N}}X_{n}=X\neq\varnothing.     By the Baire category theorem for the non-empty complete metric space  X , there exists m such that    X  m     subscript  X  m    X_{m}   has non-empty interior , i.e. , there exist     x  0   ∈   X  m        subscript  x  0    subscript  X  m     x_{0}\in X_{m}   and  such that          B  ε    (   x  0   )    ¯   :=   {   x  ∈   X    :    ∥   x  -   x  0    ∥   ≤  ε   }   ⊆   X  m    .       assign   normal-¯     subscript  B  ε    subscript  x  0      conditional-set    x  X      norm    x   subscript  x  0     ε          subscript  X  m      \overline{B_{\varepsilon}(x_{0})}:=\{x\in X\,:\,\|x-x_{0}\|\leq\varepsilon\}%
 \subseteq X_{m}.     Let u ∈ X with  and . One has that:       ∥   T   (  u  )    ∥   Y     subscript   norm    T  u    Y    \displaystyle\|T(u)\|_{Y}     Taking the supremum over u in the unit ball of X , it follows that         sup   T  ∈  F      ∥  T  ∥    B   (  X  ,  Y  )      ≤   2   ε   -  1    m   <  ∞   .          subscript  supremum    T  F     subscript   norm  T     B   X  Y        2   superscript  ε    1    m            \sup\nolimits_{T\in F}\|T\|_{B(X,Y)}\leq 2\varepsilon^{-1}m<\infty.     There are also simple proofs not using the Baire theorem .  Corollaries  Corollary. If a sequence of bounded operators ( T n ) converges pointwise, that is, the limit of { T n ( x )} exists for all x in X , then these pointwise limits define a bounded operator T .  Note it is not claimed above that T n converges to T in operator norm, i.e. uniformly on bounded sets. (However, since { T n } is bounded in operator norm, and the limit operator T is continuous, a standard "3-ε" estimate shows that T n converges to T uniformly on compact sets.)  Corollary. Any weakly bounded subset S in a normed space Y is bounded.''  Indeed, the elements of S define a pointwise bounded family of continuous linear forms on the Banach space X = Y* , continuous dual of Y . By the uniform boundedness principle, the norms of elements of S , as functionals on X , that is, norms in the second dual Y** , are bounded. But for every s in S , the norm in the second dual coincides with the norm in Y , by a consequence of the Hahn–Banach theorem .  Let L ( X , Y ) denote the continuous operators from X to Y , with the operator norm. If the collection F is unbounded in L ( X , Y ), then by the uniform boundedness principle, we have:      R  =   {   x  ∈   X    :     sup   T  ∈  F      ∥   T  x   ∥   Y    =  ∞   }   ≠  ∅        R   conditional-set    x  X       subscript  supremum    T  F     subscript   norm    T  x    Y                R=\left\{x\in X\ :\ \sup\nolimits_{T\in F}\|Tx\|_{Y}=\infty\right\}\neq\varnothing     In fact, R is dense in X . The complement of R in X is the countable union of closed sets ∪ X n . By the argument used in proving the theorem, each X n is nowhere dense , i.e. the subset ∪ X n is of first category . Therefore R is the complement of a subset of first category in a Baire space. By definition of a Baire space, such sets (called residual sets ) are dense. Such reasoning leads to the principle of condensation of singularities , which can be formulated as follows:  Theorem. Let X be a Banach space, { Y n } a sequence of normed vector spaces, and F n a unbounded family in L ( X , Y n ). Then the set      R  =   {   x  ∈   X    :     ∀  n   ∈  𝐍   :     sup   T  ∈   F  n       ∥   T  x   ∥    Y  n     =  ∞    }       R   conditional-set    x  X    normal-:     for-all  n   𝐍       subscript  supremum    T   subscript  F  n      subscript   norm    T  x     subscript  Y  n           R=\left\{x\in X\ :\ \forall n\in\mathbf{N}:\sup\nolimits_{T\in F_{n}}\|Tx\|_{Y%
 _{n}}=\infty\right\}     is of second category, and thus dense in X .  Proof. The complement of R is the countable union       ⋃   n  ,  m     {   x  ∈   X    :     sup   T  ∈   F  n       ∥   T  x   ∥    Y  n     ≤  m   }       subscript    n  m     conditional-set    x  X       subscript  supremum    T   subscript  F  n      subscript   norm    T  x     subscript  Y  n     m      \bigcup\nolimits_{n,m}\left\{x\in X\ :\ \sup\nolimits_{T\in F_{n}}\|Tx\|_{Y_{n%
 }}\leq m\right\}     of sets of first category. Therefore its residual set R is dense.  Example: pointwise convergence of Fourier series  Let   𝕋   𝕋   \mathbb{T}   be the circle , and let    C   (  𝕋  )       C  𝕋    C(\mathbb{T})   be the Banach space of continuous functions on   𝕋   𝕋   \mathbb{T}   , with the uniform norm . Using the uniform boundedness principle, one can show that the Fourier series, "typically", does not converge pointwise for elements in    C   (  𝕋  )       C  𝕋    C(\mathbb{T})   .  For    f  ∈   C   (  𝕋  )        f    C  𝕋     f\in C(\mathbb{T})   , its Fourier series is defined by         ∑   k  ∈  𝐙      f  ^    (  k  )    e   i  k  x      =    ∑   k  ∈  𝐙      1   2  π     (    ∫  0   2  π     f   (  t  )    e   -   i  k  t     d  t    )    e   i  k  x       ,        subscript     k  𝐙       normal-^  f   k   superscript  e    i  k  x        subscript     k  𝐙        1    2  π      superscript   subscript   0     2  π      f  t   superscript  e      i  k  t     d  t     superscript  e    i  k  x        \sum_{k\in\mathbf{Z}}\hat{f}(k)e^{ikx}=\sum_{k\in\mathbf{Z}}\frac{1}{2\pi}%
 \left(\int_{0}^{2\pi}f(t)e^{-ikt}dt\right)e^{ikx},     and the N -th symmetric partial sum is         S  N    (  f  )    (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =   -  N    N     f  ^    (  k  )    e   i  k  x      =    1   2  π      ∫  0   2  π     f   (  t  )    D  N    (   x  -  t   )   d  t      ,           subscript  S  N   f  x     superscript   subscript     k    N     N      normal-^  f   k   superscript  e    i  k  x               1    2  π      superscript   subscript   0     2  π      f  t   subscript  D  N     x  t   d  t        S_{N}(f)(x)=\sum_{k=-N}^{N}\hat{f}(k)e^{ikx}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}f(t)%
 D_{N}(x-t)\,dt,     where D N is the N -th Dirichlet kernel . Fix    x  ∈  𝕋      x  𝕋    x\in\mathbb{T}   and consider the convergence of { S N ( f )( x )}. The functional φ N,x      C   (  𝕋  )    →  ℂ     normal-→    C  𝕋   ℂ    C(\mathbb{T})\rightarrow\mathbb{C}   defined by          φ   N  ,  x     (  f  )    =    S  N    (  f  )    (  x  )     ,   f  ∈   C   (  𝕋  )      ,     formulae-sequence       subscript  φ   N  x    f      subscript  S  N   f  x      f    C  𝕋      \varphi_{N,x}(f)=S_{N}(f)(x),\qquad f\in C(\mathbb{T}),     is bounded. The norm of φ N,x , in the dual of    C   (  𝕋  )       C  𝕋    C(\mathbb{T})   , is the norm of the signed measure (2π) −1 D N ( x − t ) d t , namely        ∥   φ   N  ,  x    ∥   =    1   2  π      ∫  0   2  π      |    D  N    (   x  -  t   )    |   d  t     =    1   2  π      ∫  0   2  π      |    D  N    (  s  )    |   d  s     =    ∥   D  N   ∥     L  1    (  𝕋  )      .         norm   subscript  φ   N  x         1    2  π      superscript   subscript   0     2  π           subscript  D  N     x  t     d  t              1    2  π      superscript   subscript   0     2  π           subscript  D  N   s    d  s           subscript   norm   subscript  D  N       superscript  L  1   𝕋       \left\|\varphi_{N,x}\right\|=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\left|D_{N}(x-t)%
 \right|\,dt=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\left|D_{N}(s)\right|\,ds=\left\|D_{N%
 }\right\|_{L^{1}(\mathbb{T})}.     One can verify that         1   2  π      ∫  0   2  π      |    D  N    (  t  )    |   d  t     ≥    ∫  0  π       |   sin   (    (   N  +   1  2    )   t   )    |   t    d  t    →  ∞   .            1    2  π      superscript   subscript   0     2  π           subscript  D  N   t    d  t       superscript   subscript   0   π               N    1  2    t     t   d  t      normal-→        \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}|D_{N}(t)|\,dt\geq\int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{\left|\sin%
 \left((N+\tfrac{1}{2})t\right)\right|}{t}\,dt\to\infty.     So the collection {φ N,x } is unbounded in    C    (  𝕋  )   ∗       C   superscript  𝕋  normal-∗     C(\mathbb{T})^{\ast}   , the dual of    C   (  𝕋  )       C  𝕋    C(\mathbb{T})   . Therefore by the uniform boundedness principle, for any    x  ∈  𝕋      x  𝕋    x\in\mathbb{T}   , the set of continuous functions whose Fourier series diverges at x is dense in    C   (  𝕋  )       C  𝕋    C(\mathbb{T})   .  More can be concluded by applying the principle of condensation of singularities. Let { x m } be a dense sequence in   𝕋   𝕋   \mathbb{T}   . Define φ N,x m in the similar way as above. The principle of condensation of singularities then says that the set of continuous functions whose Fourier series diverges at each x m is dense in    C   (  𝕋  )       C  𝕋    C(\mathbb{T})   (however, the Fourier series of a continuous function f converges to f ( x ) for almost every    x  ∈  𝕋      x  𝕋    x\in\mathbb{T}   , by Carleson's theorem ).  Generalizations  The least restrictive setting for the uniform boundedness principle is a barrelled space where the following generalized version of the theorem holds :  Theorem. Given a barrelled space X and a locally convex space  Y , then any family of pointwise bounded continuous linear mappings from X to Y is equicontinuous (even uniformly equicontinuous ).  Alternatively, the statement also holds whenever X is a Baire space and Y is a locally convex space .  proves a weaker form of this theorem with Fréchet spaces rather than the usual Banach spaces. Specifically,  Theorem. Let X be a Fréchet space, Y a normed space, and H a set of continuous linear mappings of X into Y . If for every x in X         sup   u  ∈  H     ∥   u   (  x  )    ∥    <  ∞   ,        subscript  supremum    u  H     norm    u  x        \sup\nolimits_{u\in H}\|u(x)\|<\infty,   then the family H is equicontinuous.
