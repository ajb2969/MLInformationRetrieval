Sound energy density level




Sound energy density level

The sound energy density level gives the ratio of a sound incidence as a sound energy value in comparison to a reference level of 0 dB (DIN 45630). It is a logarithmic measure of the ratio of two sound energy densities.
Definition
The sound energy density level LE is:



where E1 and E0 are the energy densities. The unit of the sound energy density level is the decibel (dB).
If E0 is the standard reference sound energy density of1
