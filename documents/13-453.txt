   Dimethylphenylphosphine      Dimethylphenylphosphine   ''' Dimethylphenylphosphine ''' is an organophosphorus compound with a formula P(C 6 H 5 )(CH 3 ) 2 . The phosphorus is connected to a phenyl group and two methyl groups, making it the simplest aromatic alkylphosphine. This colorless air sensitive liquid is commonly used as a ligand in transition metal complexes . These complexes are often soluble in organic solvents.  Preparation  Dimethylphenylphosphine is prepared by the reaction of methylmagnesium halide with dichlorophenylphosphine .   (C 6 H 5 )Cl 2 P + 2CH 3 MgBr → (C 6 H 5 )(CH 3 ) 2 P + 2MgBrCl   The phosphine is purified by distillation under reduced pressure. 1 A solution of (C 6 H 5 )(CH 3 ) 2 P in CDCl 3 shows proton NMR signals at δ 7.0-7.5 and a doublet at δ 1.2. The phosphorus-31 NMR spectrum shows a singlet at -45.89 ppm in CDCl 3 . 2  Structure and properties  Dimethylphenylphosphine is a pyramidal molecule where the phenyl group and two methyl groups are connected to the phosphorus. The bond length and angles are the following: P-C Me : 1.844, P-C Ph : 1.845 Å, C-C: 1.401 Å, C-H Me : 1.090 Å, C-H Ph : 1.067 Å, C-P-C: 96.9°, C-P-C (ring): 103.4°, P-C-H: 115.2°. 3  When attached to chiral metal centers, the P-methyl groups are diastereotopic , appearing as separate doublets in the 1 H NMR spectrum.  Comparisons with related phosphine ligands  The nν CO of IrCl(CO)(PPh 3 ) 2 and IrCl(CO)(PMe 2 Ph) 2 are both at 1960 cm −1 , whereas n CO for Ir-Cl(CO)(PMe 3 ) 2 is at 1938 cm −1 . 4 5  The acidity of various protonated phosphine ligands gives insights into their basicity as ligands: 6 7   [HPMe 2 Ph] + = 6.8  [HPPh 3 ] + = 2.7  [HPEt 3 ] + = 8.7.   Thus PMe 2 Ph is intermediate in basicity relative to PPh 3 and PEt 3 .  The ligand cone angle (θ) is the apex angle of a cylindrical cone, which is centered 2.28 Å from the center of the P atom. However, the cone angle of an unsymmetrical ligand cannot be determined in the same. In order to determine an effective cone angle for an unsymmetrical ligand PX 1 X 2 X 3 , the following equation is used:      θ  =    2  3     ∑   i  =  1   3     θ  i   2         θ      2  3     superscript   subscript     i  1    3      subscript  θ  i   2       \theta=\frac{2}{3}\sum_{i=1}^{3}\frac{\theta_{i}}{2}     Where θ i represent the half angle.  The resulting angles for -PMe 3 , PMe 2 Ph, PPh 3 are the following: PMe 3 = 118°, PMe 2 Ph= 122°, PPh 3 = 145°. Thus PMe 2 Ph is intermediate in size relative to PMe 3 and PPh 3 . 8  References  "  Category:Tertiary phosphines  Category:Aromatic compounds     C. Frajerman; B. Meunier; M. E.
