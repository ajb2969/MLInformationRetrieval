   Thomsen's theorem      Thomsen's theorem    Thomsen's theorem , named after Gerhard Thomsen , is a theorem in elementary geometry. It shows that a certain path constructed by line segments being parallel to the edges of a triangle always ends up at its starting point.  Consider an arbitrary triangle ABC with a point P 1 on its edge BC . A sequence of points and parallel lines is constructed as follows. The parallel line to AC through P 1  intersects  AB in P 2 and the parallel line to BC through P 2 intersects AC in P 3 . Continuing in this fashion the parallel line to AB through P 3 intersects BC in P 4 and the parallel line to AC through P 4 intersects AB in P 5 . Finally the parallel line to BC through P 5 intersects AC in P 6 and the parallel line to AB through P 6 intersects BC in P 7 . Thomsen's theorem now states that P 7 is identical to P 1 and hence the construction always leads to a closed path P 1 P 2 P 3 P 4 P 5 P 6 P 1  References   Satz von Thomsen In: Schülerduden – Mathematik II .
