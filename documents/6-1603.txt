   Matrix population models      Matrix population models   Population models are used in population ecology to model the dynamics of wildlife or human populations. Matrix population models are a specific type of population model that uses matrix algebra . Matrix algebra, in turn, is simply a form of algebraic shorthand for summarizing a larger number of often repetitious and tedious algebraic computations.  All populations can be modeled by one simple equation:        N   t  +  1    =       N  t   +  B   -  D   +  I   -  E    ,       subscript  N    t  1             subscript  N  t   B   D   I   E     N_{t+1}=N_{t}+B-D+I-E,     where:   N t+1 = abundance at time t+1  N t = abundance at time t  B = number of births within the population between N t and N t+1  D = number of deaths within the population between N t and N t+1  I = number of individuals immigrating into the population between N t and N t+1  E = number of individuals emigrating from the population between N t and N t+1   This equation is called a BIDE model (Birth, Immigration, Death, Emigration model).  Although BIDE models are conceptually simple, reliable estimates of the 5 variables contained therein (N, B, D, I and E) are often difficult to obtain. Usually a researcher attempts to estimate current abundance, N t , often using some form of mark and recapture technique. Estimates of B might be obtained via a ratio of immatures to adults soon after the breeding season, R i . Number of deaths can be obtained by estimating annual survival probability, usually via mark and recapture methods, then multipling present abundance and survival rate . Often, immigration and emigration are ignored because they are so difficult to estimate.  For added simplicity it may help to think of time t as the end of the breeding season in year t and to imagine that one is studying a species that has only one discrete breeding season per year.  The BIDE model can then be expressed as:       N   t  +  1    =     N   t  ,  a    ×   S  a    +    N   t  ,  i    ×   R  i   ×   S  i          subscript  N    t  1         subscript  N   t  a     subscript  S  a       subscript  N   t  i     subscript  R  i    subscript  S  i       N_{t+1}=N_{t,a}\times S_{a}+N_{t,i}\times R_{i}\times S_{i}     where:   N t,a = number of adult females at time t  N t,i = number of immature females at time t  S a = annual survival of adult females from time t to time t+1  S i = annual survival of immature females from time t to time t+1  R i = ratio of surviving young females at the end of the breeding season per breeding female   In matrix notation this model can be expressed as:          (      N   t  +   l  i          N   t  +   l  a        )       =    (       S  i    R  i        S  a    R  i         S  i      S  a      )    (      N   t  i         N   t  a       )        .         subscript  N    t   subscript  l  i        subscript  N    t   subscript  l  a         absent         subscript  S  i    subscript  R  i       subscript  S  a    subscript  R  i       subscript  S  i    subscript  S  a        subscript  N   subscript  t  i       subscript  N   subscript  t  a           \begin{aligned}\displaystyle\begin{pmatrix}N_{t+l_{i}}\\
 N_{t+l_{a}}\end{pmatrix}&\displaystyle=\begin{pmatrix}S_{i}R_{i}&S_{a}R_{i}\\
 S_{i}&S_{a}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}N_{t_{i}}\\
 N_{t_{a}}\end{pmatrix}\end{aligned}.     Suppose that you are studying a species with a maximum lifespan of 4 years. The following is an age-based Leslie matrix for this species. Each row in the first and third matrices corresponds to animals within a given age range (0–1 years, 1–2 years and 2–3 years). In a Leslie matrix the top row of the middle matrix consists of age-specific fertilities: F 1 , F 2 and F 3 . Note, that F 1 = S i ×R i in the matrix above. Since this species does not live to be 4 years old the matrix does not contain an S 3 term.          (      N   t  +   l  1          N   t  +   l  2          N   t  +   l  3        )       =    (      F  1      F  2      F  3        S  1     0    0      0     S  2     0     )    (      N   t  1         N   t  2         N   t  3       )        .         subscript  N    t   subscript  l  1        subscript  N    t   subscript  l  2        subscript  N    t   subscript  l  3         absent       subscript  F  1    subscript  F  2    subscript  F  3      subscript  S  1   0  0    0   subscript  S  2   0       subscript  N   subscript  t  1       subscript  N   subscript  t  2       subscript  N   subscript  t  3           \begin{aligned}\displaystyle\begin{pmatrix}N_{t+l_{1}}\\
 N_{t+l_{2}}\\
 N_{t+l_{3}}\end{pmatrix}&\displaystyle=\begin{pmatrix}F_{1}&F_{2}&F_{3}\\
 S_{1}&0&0\\
 0&S_{2}&0\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}N_{t_{1}}\\
 N_{t_{2}}\\
 N_{t_{3}}\end{pmatrix}\end{aligned}.     These models can give rise to interesting cyclical or seemingly chaotic patterns in abundance over time when fertility rates are high.  The terms F i and S i can be constants or they can be functions of environment, such as habitat or population size. Randomness can also be incorporated into the environmental component.
