   Histone-arginine N-methyltransferase      Histone-arginine N-methyltransferase   Histone-arginine N-methyltransferase (, histone protein methylase I , nuclear protein (histone) N-methyltransferase , protein methylase I , S-adenosyl-L-methionine:histone-arginine omega-N-methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:histone-arginine Nomega-methyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + histone - arginine    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + histone-Nomega-methyl-arginine    The enzyme forms the Nomega-monomethyl- and Nomega,Nomega'-dimethyl.
