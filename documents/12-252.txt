Size homotopy group

The concept of size homotopy group is analogous in size theory of the classical concept of homotopy group. In order to give its definition, let us assume that a size pair

 
  is given, where 
 
 
 
  is a closed manifold of class 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a continuous function. Let us consider the partial order

 
  in 
 
 
 
  defined by setting 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 . For every 
 
 
 
  we set 
 
 
 
 .
Assume that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are two paths from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and a homotopy from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , based at 
 
 
 
 , exists in the topological space

 
 , then we write 
 
 
 
 . The first size homotopy group of the size pair

 
  computed at 
 
 
 
  is defined to be the quotient set of the set of all paths from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  with respect to the equivalence relation

 
 , endowed with the operation induced by the usual composition of based loops.1
In other words, the first size homotopy group of the size pair

 
  computed at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the image 
 
 
 
  of the first homotopy group

 
  with base point 
 
 
 
  of the topological space

 
 , when 
 
 
 
  is the homomorphism induced by the inclusion of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
The 
 
 
 
 -th size homotopy group is obtained by substituting the loops based at 
 
 
 
  with the continuous functions

 
  taking a fixed point of 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , as happens when higher homotopy groups are defined.
