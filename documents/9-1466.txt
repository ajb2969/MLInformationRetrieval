   Goormaghtigh conjecture      Goormaghtigh conjecture   In mathematics , the Goormaghtigh conjecture is a conjecture in number theory named for the Belgian  mathematician  René Goormaghtigh . The conjecture is that the only non-trivial integer solutions of the exponential Diophantine equation         x  m   -  1    x  -  1    =     y  n   -  1    y  -  1             superscript  x  m   1     x  1         superscript  y  n   1     y  1      \frac{x^{m}-1}{x-1}=\frac{y^{n}-1}{y-1}     satisfying x > y > 1 and n , m > 2 are   ( x , y , m , n ) = (5, 2, 3, 5); and  ( x , y , m , n ) = (90, 2, 3, 13).   This may be expressed as saying that 31 and 8191 are the only two numbers that are repunits with at least 3 digits in two different bases .  Balasubramanian and Shorey proved in 1980 that there are only finitely many possible solutions to the equations in ( x , y , m , n ) with prime divisors of x and y lying in a given finite set and that they may be effectively computed .
