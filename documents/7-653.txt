Miller cylindrical projection

 The Miller cylindrical projection is a modified Mercator projection, proposed by Osborn Maitland Miller (1897–1979) in 1942. The latitude is scaled by a factor of 4/5, projected according to Mercator, and then the result is multiplied by 5/4 to retain scale along the equator.1 Hence:






or inversely,






where λ is the longitude from the central meridian of the projection, and 

 is the latitude.2 Meridians are thus about 0.733 the length of the equator.
In GIS applications, this projection is known as: "EPSG:54003 - World Miller Cylindrical"
