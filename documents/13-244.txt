   Community matrix      Community matrix   In mathematical biology , the community matrix is the linearization of the Lotka–Volterra equation at an equilibrium point . The eigenvalues of the community matrix determine the stability of the equilibrium point.  The Lotka–Volterra predator-prey model is          d  x    d  t        =   x   (   α  -   β  y    )            d  y    d  t         =   -   y   (   γ  -   δ  x    )      ,              d  x     d  t      absent    x    α    β  y       missing-subexpression         d  y     d  t      absent      y    γ    δ  x        missing-subexpression      \begin{array}[]{rcl}\frac{dx}{dt}&=x(\alpha-\beta y)\\
 \frac{dy}{dt}&=-y(\gamma-\delta x),\end{array}   where x ( t ) denotes the number of prey, y ( t ) the number of predators, and α , β , γ and δ are constants. The linearization of these differential equations at an equilibrium point ( x *, y *) has the form        [        d  u    d  t            d  v    d  t        ]   =   A   [     u      v     ]     ,            d  u     d  t          d  v     d  t        A    u    v       \begin{bmatrix}\frac{du}{dt}\\
 \frac{dv}{dt}\end{bmatrix}=A\begin{bmatrix}u\\
 v\end{bmatrix},   where u = x − x * and v = y − y *. The matrix A is called the community matrix. If A has an eigenvalue with positive real part then the equilibrium is unstable, but if all eigenvalues have negative real part then it is stable.  References    .
