Aspartate—prephenate aminotransferase




Aspartate—prephenate aminotransferase

In enzymology, an aspartate-prephenate aminotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-arogenate + oxaloacetate 
 
 
 
  prephenate + L-aspartate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-arogenate and oxaloacetate, whereas its two products are prephenate and L-aspartate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-arogenate:oxaloacetate aminotransferase. Other names in common use include prephenate transaminase (ambiguous), PAT (ambiguous), prephenate aspartate aminotransferase, and L-aspartate:prephenate aminotransferase.
