   Diphtheria toxin      Diphtheria toxin   Diphtheria toxin is an exotoxin secreted by Corynebacterium diphtheriae , the pathogen  bacterium that causes diphtheria . Unusually, the toxin gene is encoded by a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria). 1 The toxin causes the disease diphtheria in humans by gaining entry into the cell cytoplasm and inhibiting protein synthesis. 2  Structure  Diphtheria toxin is a single polypeptide chain of 535 amino acids consisting of two subunits linked by disulfide bridges , known as an A-B toxin . Binding to the cell surface of the B subunit (the less stable of the two subunits) allows the A subunit (the more stable part of the protein) to penetrate the host cell . 3  The crystal structure of the diphtheria toxin homodimer has been determined to 2.5 A resolution. The structure reveals a Y-shaped molecule consisting of 3 domains . Fragment A contains the catalytic C domain, and fragment B consists of the T and R domains 4 5   The N-terminal catalytic domain, known as the C domain, has an unusual beta+alpha fold . 6 The C domain blocks protein synthesis by transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD to a diphthamide residue of EF-2. 7 8  A central translocation domain, known as the T domain or TM domain. The T domain has a multi-helical globin -like fold with two additional helices at N-termini, but which has no counterpart to the first globin  helix . This domain is thought to unfold in the membrane . 9  pH -induced conformational change in the T domain triggers insertion into the endosomal membrane and facilitates the transfer of the C domain into the cytoplasm . 10 11  A C-terminal receptor-binding domain, known as the R domain. This domain has a beta-sandwich  fold consisting of nine strands in two sheets with Greek-key topology; it is a subclass of immunoglobin -like fold. 12 The R domain binds to cell surface receptor , permitting the toxin to enter the cell by receptor mediated endocytosis . 13 14   Mechanism  The diphtheria toxin has the same mechanism of action as the enzyme NAD(+)—diphthamide ADP-ribosyltransferase (). It catalyzes the transfer of NAD + to a diphthamide residue in eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2), inactivating this protein. It does so by ADP-ribosylating the unusual amino acid  diphthamide . In this way, it acts as a RNA translational inhibitor. The catalysed reaction is as follows:   NAD + + peptide diphthamide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   nicotinamide + peptide N-(ADP-D-ribosyl)diphthamide.   Diphtheria toxin has also been associated with the development of myocarditis. Myocarditis secondary to diphtheria toxin is considered one of the biggest risks to non-immunized children.  The exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses a similar mechanism of action.  Lethal dose  Diphtheria toxin is extraordinarily potent. 15 The lethal dose for humans is about 0.1 μg of toxin per kg of bodyweight. A massive release of toxin into the body will likely cause lethal necrosis of the heart and liver . 16  History  Diphtheria toxin was discovered in 1890 by Emil Adolf von Behring . In 1951, Freeman found that the toxin gene was not encoded on the bacterial chromosome, but by a lysogenic  phage infecting all toxigenic strains. 17 18 19  Clinical use  The drug denileukin diftitox uses diphtheria toxin as an antineoplastic agent. Resimmune ™ is an immunotoxin which is in Clinical Trials in Cutaneous T cell lymphoma patients. It uses diphtheria toxin (truncated by the cell binding domain) coupled to anti-CD3ε Ab (UCHT1).
