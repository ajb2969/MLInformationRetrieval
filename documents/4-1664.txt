   Hilbert's Theorem 90      Hilbert's Theorem 90   In abstract algebra , Hilbert's Theorem 90 (or Satz 90 ) is an important result on cyclic extensions of fields (or to one of its generalizations) that leads to Kummer theory . In its most basic form, it states that if L / K is a cyclic extension of fields with Galois group  G =¬†Gal( L / K ) generated by an element s and if a is an element of L of relative norm 1, then there exists b in L such that   a = s ( b )/ b .   The theorem takes its name from the fact that it is the 90th theorem in David Hilbert 's famous Zahlbericht , although it is originally due to . Often a more general theorem due to  is given the name, stating that if L / K is a finite Galois extension of fields with Galois group G =¬†Gal( L / K ), then the first cohomology group is trivial:   H 1 ( G , L √ó ) = {1}   Examples  Let L / K be the quadratic extension      ‚Ñö   (  i  )    /  ‚Ñö        ‚Ñö  i   ‚Ñö    \mathbb{Q}(i)/\mathbb{Q}   . The Galois group is cyclic of order 2, its generator s acting via conjugation:       s  :    c  -   d  i    ‚Ü¶   c  +   d   i       .     normal-:  s   maps-to    c    d  i      c    d  i       s:\,\,c-di\mapsto c+di\ .     An element    x  =   a  +   b  i        x    a    b  i      x=a+bi   in L has norm     x   x  s    =    a  2   +   b  2          x   superscript  x  s       superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2      xx^{s}=a^{2}+b^{2}   . An element of norm one corresponds to a rational solution of the equation      a  2   +   b  2    =  1         superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2    1    a^{2}+b^{2}=1   or in other words, a point with rational coordinates on the unit circle . Hilbert's Theorem 90 then states that every element y of norm one can be parametrized (with integral c , d ) as      y  =    c  +   d  i     c  -   d  i     =      c  2   -   d  2      c  2   +   d  2     +     2  c  d     c  2   +   d  2     i          y      c    d  i      c    d  i                 superscript  c  2    superscript  d  2       superscript  c  2    superscript  d  2           2  c  d      superscript  c  2    superscript  d  2     i       y=\frac{c+di}{c-di}=\frac{c^{2}-d^{2}}{c^{2}+d^{2}}+\frac{2cd}{c^{2}+d^{2}}i   which may be viewed as a rational parametrization of the rational points on the unit circle. Rational points     (  x  ,  y  )   =   (   a  /  c   ,   b  /  c   )        x  y      a  c     b  c      \,(x,y)=(a/c,b/c)   on the unit circle      x  2   +   y  2    =  1         superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    1    x^{2}+y^{2}=1   correspond to Pythagorean triples , i.e. triples    (  a  ,  b  ,  c  )     a  b  c    \,(a,b,c)   of integers satisfying       a   2   +   b  2    =   c  2          superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2     superscript  c  2     \,a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}   .  Cohomology  The theorem can be stated in terms of group cohomology : if L √ó is the multiplicative group of any (not necessarily finite) Galois extension L of a field K with corresponding Galois group G , then   H 1 ( G , L √ó ) = {1}.   A further generalization using non-abelian group cohomology states that if H is either the general or special linear group over L , then   H 1 ( G , H ) = {1}.   This is a generalization since L √ó = GL 1 ( L ).  Another generalization is      H    e  ¬¥   t   1    (  X  ,   ùêÜ  m   )    =    H  1    (  X  ,   ùí™  X  √ó   )    =   Pic   (  X  )             subscript   superscript  H  1      normal-¬¥  e   t     X   subscript  ùêÜ  m        superscript  H  1    X   superscript   subscript  ùí™  X              Pic  X      H^{1}_{\acute{e}t}(X,\mathbf{G}_{m})=H^{1}(X,\mathcal{O}_{X}^{\times})=\mathrm%
