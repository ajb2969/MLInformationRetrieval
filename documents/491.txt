   Bayes classifier      Bayes classifier   In statistical classification the Bayes classifier minimises the probability of misclassification . 1  Definition  Suppose a pair    (  X  ,  Y  )     X  Y    (X,Y)   takes values in     ℝ  d   ×   {  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  K  }        superscript  ℝ  d    1  2  normal-…  K     \mathbb{R}^{d}\times\{1,2,\dots,K\}   , where   Y   Y   Y   is the class label of   X   X   X   . This means that the conditional distribution of X , given that the label Y takes the value r is given by      X  ∣  Y  =  r  ∼   P  r      fragments  X  normal-∣  Y   r  similar-to   subscript  P  r     X\mid Y=r\sim P_{r}   for    r  =   1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  K       r   1  2  normal-…  K     r=1,2,\dots,K     where "   ∼   similar-to   \sim   " means "is distributed as", and where    P  r     subscript  P  r    P_{r}   denotes a probability distribution.  A classifier is a rule that assigns to an observation X = x a guess or estimate of what the unobserved label Y = r actually was. In theoretical terms, a classifier is a measurable function    C  :    ℝ  d   →   {  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  K  }       normal-:  C   normal-→   superscript  ℝ  d    1  2  normal-…  K      C:\mathbb{R}^{d}\to\{1,2,\dots,K\}   , with the interpretation that C classifies the point x to the class C ( x ). The probability of misclassification, or risk, of a classifier C is defined as        ℛ   (  C  )    =   P   {    C   (  X  )    ≠  Y   }     .        ℛ  C    normal-P      C  X   Y      \mathcal{R}(C)=\operatorname{P}\{C(X)\neq Y\}.     The Bayes classifier is         C  Bayes    (  x  )    =    argmax   r  ∈   {  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  K  }      P   (   Y  =  r   ∣   X  =  x   )      .         superscript  C  Bayes   x        r   1  2  normal-…  K    argmax    normal-P    Y  r     X  x       C^{\text{Bayes}}(x)=\underset{r\in\{1,2,\dots,K\}}{\operatorname{argmax}}%
 \operatorname{P}(Y=r\mid X=x).     In practice, as in most of statistics, the difficulties and subtleties are associated with modeling the probability distributions effectively—in this case,    P   (   Y  =  r   ∣   X  =  x   )      normal-P    Y  r     X  x     \operatorname{P}(Y=r\mid X=x)   . The Bayes classifier is a useful benchmark in statistical classification .  The excess risk of a general classifier   C   C   C   (possibly depending on some training data) is defined as      ℛ   (  C  )    -   ℛ   (   C  Bayes   )     .        ℛ  C     ℛ   superscript  C  Bayes      \mathcal{R}(C)-\mathcal{R}(C^{\text{Bayes}}).   Thus this non-negative quantity is important for assessing the performance of different classification techniques. A classifier is said to be consistent if the excess risk converges to zero as the size of the training data set tends to infinity.
