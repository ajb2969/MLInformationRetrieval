Itaconyl-CoA hydratase

In enzymology, an itaconyl-CoA hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

citramalyl-CoA 
 
 
 
  itaconyl-CoA + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, citramalyl-CoA, and two products, itaconyl-CoA and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is citramalyl-CoA hydro-lyase (itaconyl-CoA-forming). Other names in common use include itaconyl coenzyme A hydratase, and citramalyl-CoA hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism.
