Anshel–Anshel–Goldfeld key exchange

Anshel–Anshel–Goldfeld protocol, also known as a commutator key exchange, is a key-exchange protocol using nonabelian groups. It was invented by Drs. Michael Anshel, Iris Anshel, and Dorian Goldfeld. Unlike other group-based protocols, it does not employ any commuting or commutative subgroups of a given platform group and can use any nonabelian group with efficiently computable normal forms.
Description
Let G be a fixed nonabelian group called a platform group.
Alice's public/private information:

Alice's public key is a tuple of elements 
 
 
 
  in G.
Alice's private key is a sequence of elements from 
 
 
 
 
  and their inverses
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Based on that sequence she computes the product 
 
 
 
 .

Bob's public/private information:

Bob's public key is a tuple of elements 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
Bob's private key is a sequence of elements from 
 
 
 
  and their inverses
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 . Based on that sequence he computes the product 
 
 
 
 .

Transitions:

Alice sends a tuple 
 
 
 
  to Bob.
Bob sends a tuple 
 
 
 
  to Alice.

Shared key:
The key shared by Alice and Bob is the group element 
 
 
 
  called the commutator of 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .

Alice computes 
 
 
 
  as a product 
 
 
 
 .
Bob computes 
 
 
 
  as a product 
 
 
 
 
 .
