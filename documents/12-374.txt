   Essential dimension      Essential dimension   In mathematics , essential dimension is an invariant defined for certain algebraic structures such as algebraic groups and quadratic forms . It was introduced by J. Buhler and Z. Reichstein  1 and in its most generality defined by A. Merkurjev . 2  Basically, essential dimension measures the complexity of algebraic structures via their fields of definition. For example, a quadratic form q : V → K over a field K, where V is a K- vector space , is said to be defined over a subfield L of K if there exists a K- basis e 1 ,...,e n of V such that q can be expressed in the form     q   (   ∑    x  i    e  i     )    =   ∑    a   i  j     x  i    x  j           q       subscript  x  i    subscript  e  i           subscript  a    i  j     subscript  x  i    subscript  x  j       q(\sum x_{i}e_{i})=\sum a_{ij}x_{i}x_{j}   with all coefficients a ij belonging to L. If K has characteristic different from 2, every quadratic form is diagonalizable . Therefore q has a field of definition generated by n elements. Technically, one always works over a (fixed) base field k and the fields K and L in consideration are supposed to contain k. The essential dimension of q is then defined as the least transcendence degree over k of a subfield L of K over which q is defined.  Formal definition  Fix an arbitrary field k and let Fields/k denote the category of finitely generated field extensions of k with inclusions as morphisms . Consider a (covariant) functor F : Fields/k → Set . For a field extension K/k and an element a of F(K/k) a field of definition of a is an intermediate field K/L/k such that a is contained in the image of the map F(L/k) → F(K/k) induced by the inclusion of L in K.  The essential dimension of a , denoted by ed(a) , is the least transcendence degree (over k) of a field of definition for a . The essential dimension of the functor F , denoted by ed(F) , is the supremum of ed(a) taken over all elements a of F(K/k) and objects K/k of Fields/k.  Examples   Essential dimension of quadratic forms : For a natural number n consider the functor Q n : Fields/k → Set taking a field extension K/k to the set of isomorphism classes of non-degenerate n-dimensional quadratic forms over K and taking a morphism L/k → K/k (given by the inclusion of L in K) to the map sending the isomorphism class of a quadratic form q : V → L to the isomorphism class of the quadratic form     q  K   :    V   ⊗  L   K   →  K      normal-:   subscript  q  K    normal-→    subscript  tensor-product  L   V  K   K     q_{K}:V\otimes_{L}K\to K   .    Essential dimension of algebraic groups : For an algebraic group G over k denote by H 1 (-,G) : Fields/k → Set the functor taking a field extension K/k to the set of isomorphism classes of G- torsors over K (in the fppf -topology). The essential dimension of this functor is called the essential dimension of the algebraic group G , denoted by ed(G).    Essential dimension of a fibered category : Let   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   be a category fibered over the category     A  f  f   /  k        A  f  f   k    Aff/k   of affine k-schemes, given by a functor     p  :   ℱ  →    A  f  f   /  k     .     normal-:  p   normal-→  ℱ      A  f  f   k      p:\mathcal{F}\to Aff/k.   For example   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   may be the moduli stack     ℳ  g     subscript  ℳ  g    \mathcal{M}_{g}   of genus g curves or the classifying stack    ℬ  𝒢      ℬ  𝒢    \mathcal{BG}   of an algebraic group. Assume that for each    A  ∈    A  f  f   /  k       A      A  f  f   k     A\in Aff/k   the isomorphism classes of objects in the fiber p −1 (A) form a set. Then we get a functor F p : Fields/k → Set taking a field extension K/k to the set of isomorphism classes in the fiber     p   -  1     (   S  p  e  c   (  K  )    )        superscript  p    1      S  p  e  c  K     p^{-1}(Spec(K))   . The essential dimension of the fibered category   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   is defined as the essential dimension of the corresponding functor F p . In case of the classifying stack    ℱ  =   ℬ  𝒢       ℱ    ℬ  𝒢     \mathcal{F}=\mathcal{BG}   of an algebraic group G the value coincides with the previously defined essential dimension of G.   Known results   The essential dimension of a linear algebraic group G is always finite and bounded by the minimal dimension of a generically free representation minus the dimension of G.    The essential dimension of a finite algebraic p-group over k equals the minimal dimension of a faithful representation, provided that the base field k contains a primitive p-th root of unity.    The essential dimension of the symmetric group S n (viewed as algebraic group over k) is known for n≤5 (for every base field k), for n=6 (for k of characteristic not 2) and for n=7 (in characteristic 0).    Let T be an algebraic torus admitting a Galois splitting field L/k of degree a power of a prime p. Then the essential dimension of T equals the least rank of the kernel of a homomorphism of Gal(L/k)- lattices P → X(T) with cokernel finite and of order prime to p, where P is a permutation lattice.
