   Milnor conjecture      Milnor conjecture   In mathematics , the Milnor conjecture was a proposal by  of a description of the Milnor K-theory (mod 2) of a general field  F with characteristic different from 2, by means of the Galois (or equivalently étale ) cohomology of F with coefficients in Z /2 Z . It was proved by .  Statement of the theorem  Let F be a field of characteristic different from 2. Then there is an isomorphism         K  n  M    (  F  )    /  2   ≅    H    e  ´   t   n    (  F  ,    ℤ  /  2   ℤ   )             superscript   subscript  K  n   M   F   2      superscript   subscript  H     normal-´  e   t    n    F      ℤ  2   ℤ       K_{n}^{M}(F)/2\cong H_{\acute{e}t}^{n}(F,\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})     for all n ≥ 0, where K denotes the Milnor ring .  About the proof  The proof of this theorem by Vladimir Voevodsky uses several ideas developed by Voevodsky, Alexander Merkurjev , Andrei Suslin , Markus Rost , Fabien Morel , Eric Friedlander , and others, including the newly minted theory of motivic cohomology (a kind of substitute for singular cohomology for algebraic varieties ) and the motivic Steenrod algebra .  Generalizations  The analogue of this result for primes other than 2 was known as the Bloch–Kato conjecture . Work of Voevodsky and Markus Rost yielded a complete proof of this conjecture in 2009; the result is now called the norm residue isomorphism theorem .
