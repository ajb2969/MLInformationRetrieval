Bateman polynomials

In mathematics, the Bateman polynomials are a family Fn of orthogonal polynomials introduced by . The Batemanâ€“Pasternack polynomials are a generalization introduced by .
Bateman polynomials are given by


 
  where Pn is a Legendre polynomial.
generalized the Bateman polynomials to polynomials F with


 
   showed that the polynomials Qn studied by  , see Touchard polynomials, are the same as Bateman polynomials up to a change of variable: more precisely



Bateman and Pasternack's polynomials are special cases of the symmetric continuous Hahn polynomials.
