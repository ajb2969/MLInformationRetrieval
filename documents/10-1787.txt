   S-alkylcysteine lyase      S-alkylcysteine lyase   In enzymology , a S-alkylcysteine lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an S-alkyl-L-cysteine + water   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   an alkyl thiol + ammonia + pyruvate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-alkyl-L-cysteine and water , whereas its three products are alkyl thiol, ammonia , and pyruvate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-alkyl-L-cysteine alkyl-thiol-lyase (deaminating; pyruvate-forming) . Other names in common use include S-alkylcysteinase , alkylcysteine lyase , S-alkyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide lyase , S-alkyl-L-cysteine lyase , S-alkyl-L-cysteinase , alkyl cysteine lyase , and S-alkyl-L-cysteine alkylthiol-lyase (deaminating) . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  References     "  Category:EC 4.4.1  Category:Pyridoxal phosphate enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
