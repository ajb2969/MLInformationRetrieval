Total dual integrality

In mathematical optimization, total dual integrality is a sufficient condition for the integrality of a polyhedron. Thus, the optimization of a linear objective over the integral points of such a polyhedron can be done using techniques from linear programming.
A linear system 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are rational, is called totally dual integral (TDI) if for any 
 
 
 
  such that there is a feasible, bounded solution to the linear program


 
 
  there is an integer optimal dual solution.12
Edmonds and Giles3 showed that if a polyhedron 
 
 
 
  is the solution set of a TDI system 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  has all integer entries, then every vertex of 
 
 
 
  is integer-valued. Thus, if a linear program as above is solved by the simplex algorithm, the optimal solution returned will be integer. Further, Giles and Pulleyblank4 showed that if 
 
 
 
  is a polytope whose vertices are all integer valued, then 
 
 
 
  is the solution set of some TDI system 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is integer valued.
Note that TDI is a weaker sufficient condition for integrality than total unimodularity.5
