   Total dual integrality      Total dual integrality   In mathematical optimization , total dual integrality is a sufficient condition for the integrality of a polyhedron. Thus, the optimization of a linear objective over the integral points of such a polyhedron can be done using techniques from linear programming .  A linear system     A  x   ≤  b        A  x   b    Ax\leq b   , where   A   A   A   and   b   b   b   are rational, is called totally dual integral (TDI) if for any    c  ∈   ℤ  n       c   superscript  ℤ  n     c\in\mathbb{Z}^{n}   such that there is a feasible, bounded solution to the linear program      max    c  T   x          superscript  c  normal-T   x     \displaystyle\max c^{\mathrm{T}}x   there is an integer optimal dual solution. 1 2  Edmonds and Giles 3 showed that if a polyhedron   P   P   P   is the solution set of a TDI system     A  x   ≤  b        A  x   b    Ax\leq b   , where   b   b   b   has all integer entries, then every vertex of   P   P   P   is integer-valued. Thus, if a linear program as above is solved by the simplex algorithm , the optimal solution returned will be integer. Further, Giles and Pulleyblank 4 showed that if   P   P   P   is a polytope whose vertices are all integer valued, then   P   P   P   is the solution set of some TDI system     A  x   ≤  b        A  x   b    Ax\leq b   , where   b   b   b   is integer valued.  Note that TDI is a weaker sufficient condition for integrality than total unimodularity . 5  References  "  Category:Mathematical optimization     ↩  ↩    ↩
