   Cone (formal languages)      Cone (formal languages)   In formal language theory , a cone is a set of formal languages that has some desirable closure properties enjoyed by some well-known sets of languages, in particular by the families of regular languages , context-free languages and the recursively enumerable languages . 1 The concept of a cone is a more abstract notion that subsumes all of these families. A similar notion is the faithful cone , having somewhat relaxed conditions. For example, the context-sensitive languages do not form a cone, but still have the required properties to form a faithful cone.  The terminology cone has a French origin. In the American oriented literature one usually speaks of a full trio . The trio corresponds to the faithful cone.  Definition  A cone is a non-empty family   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   of languages such that, for any    L  ∈  𝒮      L  𝒮    L\in\mathcal{S}   over some alphabet   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   ,   if   h   h   h   is a homomorphism from    Σ  ∗     superscript  normal-Σ  normal-∗    \Sigma^{\ast}   to some    Δ  ∗     superscript  normal-Δ  normal-∗    \Delta^{\ast}   , the language    h   (  L  )       h  L    h(L)   is in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   ;  if   h   h   h   is a homomorphism from some    Δ  ∗     superscript  normal-Δ  normal-∗    \Delta^{\ast}   to    Σ  ∗     superscript  normal-Σ  normal-∗    \Sigma^{\ast}   , the language     h   -  1     (  L  )        superscript  h    1    L    h^{-1}(L)   is in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   ;  if   R   R   R   is any regular language over   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   , then    L  ∩  R      L  R    L\cap R   is in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   .   The family of all regular languages is contained in any cone.  If one restricts the definition to homomorphisms that do not introduce the empty word   λ   λ   \lambda   then one speaks of a faithful cone ; the inverse homomorphisms are not restricted. Within the Chomsky hierarchy , the regular languages, the context-free languages, and the recursively enumerable languages are all cones, whereas the context-sensitive languages and the recursive languages are only faithful cones.  Relation to Transducers  A finite state transducer is a finite state automaton that has both input and output. It defines a transduction   T   T   T   , mapping a language   L   L   L   over the input alphabet into another language    T   (  L  )       T  L    T(L)   over the output alphabet. Each of the cone operations (homomorphism, inverse homomorphism, intersection with a regular language) can be implemented using a finite state transducer. And, since finite state transducers are closed under composition, every sequence of cone operations can be performed by a finite state transducer.  Conversely, every finite state transduction   T   T   T   can be decomposed into cone operations. In fact, there exists a normal form for this decomposition, 2 which is commonly known as Nivat's Theorem : 3 Namely, each such   T   T   T   can be effectively decomposed as     T   (  L  )    =   g   (     h   -  1     (  L  )    ∩  R   )          T  L     g       superscript  h    1    L   R      T(L)=g(h^{-1}(L)\cap R)   , where    g  ,  h     g  h    g,h   are homomorphisms, and   R   R   R   is a regular language depending only on   T   T   T   .  Altogether, this means that a family of languages is a cone if it is closed under finite state transductions. This is a very powerful set of operations. For instance one easily writes a (nondeterministic) finite state transducer with alphabet    {  a  ,  b  }     a  b    \{a,b\}   that removes every second   b   b   b   in words of even length (and does not change words otherwise). Since the context-free languages form a cone, they are closed under this exotic operation.
