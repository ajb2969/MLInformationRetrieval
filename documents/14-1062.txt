   Separation relation      Separation relation   In mathematics , a separation relation is a formal way to arrange a set of objects in an unoriented circle. It is defined as a quaternary relation  S ( a , b , c , d ) satisfying certain axioms, which is interpreted as asserting that a and c separate b from d . 1  Whereas a linear order endows a set with a positive end and a negative end, a separation relation forgets not only which end is which, but also where the ends are. In this way it is a final, further weakening of the concepts of a betweenness relation and a cyclic order . There is generally nothing else that can be forgotten: up to the relevant sense of interdefinability, these three relations are the only nontrivial reducts of the ordered set of rational numbers . 2  Application  The separation may be used in showing the real projective plane is a complete space . The separation relation was described with axioms in 1898 by Giovanni Vailati . 3   abcd = badc  abcd = adcb  abcd ⇒ ¬ acbd  abcd ∨ acdb ∨ adbc  abcd ∧ acde ⇒ abde .   The relation of separation of points was written AC//BD by H. S. M. Coxeter in his textbook The Real Projective Plane . 4 The axiom of continuity used is "Every monotonic sequence of points has a limit." The separation relation is used to provide definitions:   { A n } is monotonic ≡ ∀ n > 1     A  0    A  n   /  /   A  1    A   n  +  1    .     fragments   subscript  A  0    subscript  A  n      subscript  A  1    subscript  A    n  1    normal-.    A_{0}A_{n}//A_{1}A_{n+1}.     M is a limit ≡ (∀ n > 2     A  1    A  n   /  /   A  2   M     fragments   subscript  A  1    subscript  A  n      subscript  A  2   M    A_{1}A_{n}//A_{2}M   ) ∧ (∀ P     A  1   P  /  /   A  2   M     fragments   subscript  A  1   P     subscript  A  2   M    A_{1}P//A_{2}M   ⇒ ∃ n      A  1    A  n   /  /  P  M     fragments   subscript  A  1    subscript  A  n     P  M    A_{1}A_{n}//PM   ).
