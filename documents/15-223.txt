   Parry point (triangle)      Parry point (triangle)   In geometry , the Parry point is a special point associated with a plane  triangle . It is a triangle center and it is called X(111) in Clark Kimberling 's Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers . The Parry point is named in honor of the English geometer Cyril Parry, who studied them in the early 1990s. 1  Parry circle  (Figure)  Parry circle and Parry point. ( G is the centroid, and J and K are the isodynamic points of triangle ABC .)   Let ABC be a plane triangle. The circle through the centroid and the two isodynamic points of triangle ABC is called the Parry circle of triangle ABC . The equation of the Parry circle in trilinear coordinates is 2      3   (    b  2   -   c  2    )    (    c  2   -   a  2    )    (    a  2   -   b  2    )    (     a  2   y  z   +    b  2   z  x   +    c  2   x  y    )       3     superscript  b  2    superscript  c  2       superscript  c  2    superscript  a  2       superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2         superscript  a  2   y  z      superscript  b  2   z  x      superscript  c  2   x  y      \displaystyle 3(b^{2}-c^{2})(c^{2}-a^{2})(a^{2}-b^{2})(a^{2}yz+b^{2}zx+c^{2}xy)     The center of the Parry circle is also a triangle center. It is the center designated as X(351) in Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers. The trilinear coordinates of the center of the Parry circle are   f ( a , b , c ) : f ( b , c , a ) : f ( c , a , b ), where f ( a , b , c ) = a ( b 2 − c 2 ) ( b 2 + c 2 − 2 a 2 )   Parry point  The Parry circle and the circumcircle of triangle ABC intersect in two points. One of them is a focus of the Kiepert parabola of triangle ABC . 3 The other point of intersection is called the Parry point of triangle ABC .  The trilinear coordinates of the Parry point are   ( a / ( 2 a 2 − b 2 − c 2 ) : b / ( 2 b 2 − c 2 − a 2 ) : c / ( 2 c 2 − a 2 − b 2 ) )   The point of intersection of the Parry circle and the circumcircle of triangle ABC which is a focus of the Kiepert hyperbola of triangle ABC is also a triangle center and it is designated as X(110) in Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers . The trilinear coordinates of this triangle center are   ( a / ( b 2 − c 2 ) : b / ( b 2 − a 2 ) : c / ( a 2 − b 2 ) )   See also   Lester circle   References  External links  "  Category:Triangle centers     ↩  ↩  ↩
