   Macrocin O-methyltransferase      Macrocin O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a macrocin O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + macrocin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + tylosin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and macrocin , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and tylosin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:macrocin 3"'-O-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include macrocin methyltransferase , and S-adenosyl-L-methionine-macrocin O-methyltransferase .
