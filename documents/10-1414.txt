   Protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase      Protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   protocatechuate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-carboxy-2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are protocatechuate and O 2 , whereas its product is 4-carboxy-2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is protocatechuate:oxygen 4,5-oxidoreductase (decyclizing) . Other names in common use include protocatechuate 4,5-oxygenase , protocatechuic 4,5-dioxygenase , and protocatechuic 4,5-oxygenase . This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation and 2,4-dichlorobenzoate degradation . It employs one cofactor , iron .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
