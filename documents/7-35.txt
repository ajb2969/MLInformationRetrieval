   Fekete polynomial      Fekete polynomial   In mathematics , a Fekete polynomial is a polynomial        f  p    (  t  )    :=    ∑   a  =  0    p  -  1      (   a  p   )     t  a         assign     subscript  f  p   t     superscript   subscript     a  0      p  1        a  p    superscript  t  a       f_{p}(t):=\sum_{a=0}^{p-1}\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)t^{a}\,     where    (   ⋅  p   )      normal-⋅  p    \left(\frac{\cdot}{p}\right)\,   is the Legendre symbol modulo some integer p > 1.  These polynomials were known in nineteenth-century studies of Dirichlet L-functions , and indeed to Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet himself. They have acquired the name of Michael Fekete , who observed that the absence of real zeroes t of the Fekete polynomial with 0  L\left(s,\dfrac{x}{p}\right).\,  This is of considerable potential interest in number theory , in connection with the hypothetical Siegel zero near s = 1. While numerical results for small cases had indicated that there were few such real zeroes, further analysis reveals that this may indeed be a 'small number' effect.
