   Acoustic streaming      Acoustic streaming   Acoustic streaming is a steady current in a fluid driven by the absorption of high amplitude acoustic oscillations. This phenomenon can be observed near sound emitters, or in the standing waves within a Kundt's tube . It is the less-known opposite of sound generation by a flow.  There are two situations where sound is absorbed in its medium of propagation:   during propagation. 1 The attenuation coefficient is    α  =    2  η   ω  2    /   (   3  ρ   c  3    )        α      2  η   superscript  ω  2      3  ρ   superscript  c  3       \alpha=2\eta\omega^{2}/(3\rho c^{3})   , following Stokes' law (sound attenuation) . This effect is more intense at elevated frequencies and is much greater in air (where attenuation occurs on a characteristic distance    α   -  1      superscript  α    1     \alpha^{-1}   ~10 cm at 1 MHz) than in water (    α   -  1      superscript  α    1     \alpha^{-1}   ~100 m at 1 MHz). In air it is known as the Quartz wind .  near a boundary. Either when sound reaches a boundary, or when a boundary is vibrating in a still medium. 2 A wall vibrating parallel to itself generates a shear wave, of attenuated amplitude within the Stokes oscillating boundary layer . This effect is localised on an attenuation length of characteristic size    δ  =    [   η  /   (   ρ  ω   )    ]    1  /  2        δ   superscript   delimited-[]    η    ρ  ω       1  2      \delta=[\eta/(\rho\omega)]^{1/2}   whose order of magnitude is a few micrometres in both air and water at 1 MHz.   Origin: a body force due to acoustic absorption in the fluid  Acoustic streaming is a non-linear effect. 3 We can decompose the velocity field in a vibration part and a steady part    u  =   v  +   u  ¯        u    v   normal-¯  u      {u}=v+\overline{u}   . The vibration part   v   v   v   is due to sound, while the steady part is the acoustic streaming velocity (average velocity). The Navier–Stokes equations implies for the acoustic streaming velocity:          ρ  ¯     ∂  t     u  ¯   i     +    ρ  ¯     u  ¯   j     ∂  j     u  ¯   i      =     -   ∂    p  ¯   i     +   η    ∂   j  j   2     u  ¯   i      -    ∂  j    (    ρ   v  i    v  j    ¯   )      .           normal-¯  ρ     subscript   t    subscript   normal-¯  u   i        normal-¯  ρ    subscript   normal-¯  u   j     subscript   j    subscript   normal-¯  u   i               subscript   normal-¯  p   i       η    subscript   superscript   2     j  j     subscript   normal-¯  u   i        subscript   j    normal-¯    ρ   subscript  v  i    subscript  v  j         \overline{\rho}{\partial_{t}\overline{u}_{i}}+\overline{\rho}\overline{u}_{j}{%
 \partial_{j}\overline{u}_{i}}=-{\partial\overline{p}_{i}}+\eta{\partial^{2}_{%
 jj}\overline{u}_{i}}-{\partial_{j}}(\overline{\rho v_{i}v_{j}}).     The steady streaming originates from a steady body force     f  i   =   -    ∂   (    ρ   v  i    v  j    ¯   )    /   ∂   x  j           subscript  f  i          normal-¯    ρ   subscript  v  i    subscript  v  j         subscript  x  j        f_{i}=-{\partial}(\overline{\rho v_{i}v_{j}})/{\partial x_{j}}   that appears on the right hand side. This force is a function of what is known as the Reynolds stresses in turbulence    -    ρ   v  i    v  j    ¯        normal-¯    ρ   subscript  v  i    subscript  v  j       -\overline{\rho v_{i}v_{j}}   . The Reynolds stress depends on the amplitude of sound vibrations, and the body force reflects diminutions in this sound amplitude.  We see that this stress is non-linear ( quadratic ) in the velocity amplitude. It is non vanishing only where the velocity amplitude varies. If the velocity of the fluid oscillates because of sound as    ϵ   cos   (   ω  t   )        ϵ      ω  t      \epsilon\cos(\omega t)   , the quadratic non-linearity generates a steady force proportional to       ϵ  2     cos  2    (   ω  t   )     ¯   =    ϵ  2   /  2        normal-¯     superscript  ϵ  2     superscript   2     ω  t         superscript  ϵ  2   2     \scriptstyle\overline{\epsilon^{2}\cos^{2}(\omega t)}=\epsilon^{2}/2   .  Order of magnitude of acoustic streaming velocities  Even if viscosity is responsible for acoustic streaming, the value of viscosity disappears from the resulting streaming velocities in the case of near-boundary acoustic steaming.  The order of magnitude of streaming velocities are: 4   near a boundary (outside of the boundary layer):        U  ∼   -       3  /   (   4  ω   )    ×   v  0    d   v  0    /  d   x     ,     similar-to  U              3    4  ω     subscript  v  0    d   subscript  v  0    d   x      U\sim-{3}/{(4\omega)}\times v_{0}dv_{0}/dx,   with    v  0     subscript  v  0    v_{0}   the sound vibration velocity and   x   x   x   along the wall boundary. The flow is directed towards decreasing sound vibrations (vibration nodes).   near a vibrating bubble 5 of rest radius a, whose radius pulsates with relative amplitude    ϵ  =    δ  r   /  a       ϵ      δ  r   a     \epsilon=\delta r/a   (or    r  =   ϵ  a   sin   (   ω  t   )         r    ϵ  a      ω  t       r=\epsilon a\sin(\omega t)   ), and whose center of mass also periodically translates with relative amplitude     ϵ  ′   =    δ  x   /  a        superscript  ϵ  normal-′       δ  x   a     \epsilon^{\prime}=\delta x/a   (or    x  =    ϵ  ′   a   sin   (    ω  t   /  ϕ   )         x     superscript  ϵ  normal-′   a        ω  t   ϕ       x=\epsilon^{\prime}a\sin(\omega t/\phi)   ). with a phase shift   ϕ   ϕ   \phi          U  ∼   ϵ   ϵ  ′   a  ω   sin  ϕ       similar-to  U    ϵ   superscript  ϵ  normal-′   a  ω    ϕ      \displaystyle U\sim\epsilon\epsilon^{\prime}a\omega\sin\phi      far from walls 6     U  ∼    α  P   /   (   π  μ  c   )       similar-to  U      α  P     π  μ  c      U\sim\alpha P/(\pi\mu c)   far from the origin of the flow ( with   P   P   P   the acoustic power,   μ   μ   \mu   the dynamic viscosity and   c   c   c   the celerity of sound). Nearer from the origin of the flow, the velocity scales as the root of   P   P   P   .
