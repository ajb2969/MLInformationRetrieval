   Estradiol 6beta-monooxygenase      Estradiol 6beta-monooxygenase   In enzymology , an estradiol 6beta-monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   estradiol-17beta + AH 2 + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   6beta-hydroxyestradiol-17beta + A + H 2 O   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are estradiol-17beta , an electron acceptor AH 2 , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 6beta-hydroxyestradiol-17beta , the reduction product A, and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derive from O miscellaneous. The systematic name of this enzyme class is estradiol-17beta,hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (6beta-hydroxylating) . This enzyme is also called estradiol 6beta-hydroxylase . This enzyme participates in androgen and estrogen metabolism .
