   Stochastic cellular automaton      Stochastic cellular automaton   Stochastic cellular automata or 'probabilistic cellular automata ' (PCA) or 'random cellular automata ' or locally interacting Markov chains 1 are an important extension of cellular automaton . Cellular automata are a discrete-time dynamical system of interacting entities, whose state is discrete.  The state of the collection of entities is updated at each discrete time according to some simple homogenous rule. All entities' states are updated in parallel or synchronously. Stochastic Cellular Automata are CA whose updating rule is a stochastic one, which means the new entities' states are chosen according to some probability distributions. It is a discrete-time random dynamical system . From the spatial interaction between the entities, despite the simplicity of the updating rules, complex behaviour may emerge like self-organization . As mathematical object, it may be considered in the framework of stochastic processes as an interacting particle system in discrete-time.  PCA as Markov stochastic processes  As discrete-time Markov process, PCA are defined on a product space    E  =    ∏   k  ∈  G     S  k        E    subscript  product    k  G     subscript  S  k      E=\prod_{k\in G}S_{k}   (cartesian product) where   G   G   G   is a finite or infinite graph, like   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   and where    S  k     subscript  S  k    S_{k}   is a finite space, like for instance     S  k   =   {   -  1   ,   +  1   }        subscript  S  k      1     1      S_{k}=\{-1,+1\}   or     S  k   =   {  0  ,  1  }        subscript  S  k    0  1     S_{k}=\{0,1\}   . The transition probability has a product form    P   (  d  σ  |  η  )   =   ⊗   k  ∈  G     p  k    (  d   σ  k   |  η  )      fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  d  σ  normal-|  η  normal-)     subscript  tensor-product    k  G     subscript  p  k    fragments  normal-(  d   subscript  σ  k   normal-|  η  normal-)     P(d\sigma|\eta)=\otimes_{k\in G}p_{k}(d\sigma_{k}|\eta)   where    η  ∈  E      η  E    \eta\in E   and     p  k    (  d   σ  k   |  η  )      fragments   subscript  p  k    fragments  normal-(  d   subscript  σ  k   normal-|  η  normal-)     p_{k}(d\sigma_{k}|\eta)   is a probability distribution on    S  k     subscript  S  k    S_{k}   . In general some locality is required     p  k    (  d   σ  k   |  η  )   =   p  k    (  d   σ  k   |   η   V  k    )      fragments   subscript  p  k    fragments  normal-(  d   subscript  σ  k   normal-|  η  normal-)     subscript  p  k    fragments  normal-(  d   subscript  σ  k   normal-|   subscript  η   subscript  V  k    normal-)     p_{k}(d\sigma_{k}|\eta)=p_{k}(d\sigma_{k}|\eta_{V_{k}})   where     η   V  k    =    (   η  j   )    j  ∈   V  k          subscript  η   subscript  V  k     subscript   subscript  η  j     j   subscript  V  k       \eta_{V_{k}}=(\eta_{j})_{j\in V_{k}}   with    V  k     subscript  V  k    {V_{k}}   a finite neighbourhood of k. See 2 for a more detailed introduction following the probability theory's point of view.  Examples of stochastic cellular automaton  Majority cellular automaton  There is a version of the majority cellular automaton with probabilistic updating rules. See the Toom's rule .  Relation to random fields  PCA may be used to simulate the Ising model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics . 3 Some categories of models were studied from a statistical mechanics point of view.  Cellular Potts model  There is a strong connection between probabilistic cellular automata and the cellular Potts model in particular when it is implemented in parallel.
