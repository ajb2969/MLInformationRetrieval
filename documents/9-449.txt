   M. Riesz extension theorem      M. Riesz extension theorem   The M. Riesz extension theorem is a theorem in mathematics , proved by Marcel Riesz  1 during his study of the problem of moments . 2  Formulation  Let E be a real  vector space , F ⊂ E a vector subspace , and let K ⊂ E be a convex cone .  A linear functional  φ : F → R is called K - positive , if it takes only non-negative values on the cone K :         ϕ   (  x  )    ≥   0  for     x  ∈   F  ∩  K     .     formulae-sequence      ϕ  x    0  for      x    F  K      \phi(x)\geq 0\quad\text{for}\quad x\in F\cap K.     A linear functional ψ : E → R is called a K -positive extension of φ , if it is identical to φ in the domain of φ , and also returns a value of at least 0 for all points in the cone K :          ψ  |   F   =   ϕ  and       ψ   (  x  )    ≥   0  for     x  ∈  K     .     formulae-sequence     evaluated-at  ψ  F    ϕ  and     formulae-sequence      ψ  x    0  for      x  K      \psi|_{F}=\phi\quad\text{and}\quad\psi(x)\geq 0\quad\text{for}\quad x\in K.     In general, a K -positive linear functional on F can not be extended to a   K   K   K   -positive linear functional on E . Already in two dimensions one obtains a counterexample taking K to be the upper halfplane with the open negative x -axis removed. If F is the real axis, then the positive functional φ ( x , 0) = x can not be extended to a positive functional on the plane.  However, the extension exists under the additional assumption that for every y ∈ E there exists x ∈ F such that y − x ∈ K ; in other words, if E = K + F .  Proof  By transfinite induction it is sufficient to consider the case dim E / F = 1.  Choose y ∈ E \ F . Set          ψ  |   F   =  ϕ   ,    ψ   (  y  )    =   sup   {   ϕ   (  x  )    ∣    x  ∈  F   ,    y  -  x   ∈  K    }      ,     formulae-sequence     evaluated-at  ψ  F   ϕ       ψ  y    supremum   conditional-set    ϕ  x    formulae-sequence    x  F       y  x   K         \psi|_{F}=\phi,\quad\psi(y)=\sup\left\{\phi(x)\,\mid\,x\in F,\,y-x\in K\right\},     and extend ψ to E by linearity. Let us show that ψ is K -positive.  Every point z in K is a positive linear multiple of either x + y or x − y for some x ∈ F . In the first case, z = a ( y + x ), therefore y − ( − x) = z / a is in K with  − x in F . Hence        ψ   (  y  )    ≥   ψ   (   -  x   )    =   -   ψ   (  x  )      ,          ψ  y     ψ    x             ψ  x       \psi(y)\geq\psi(-x)=-\psi(x),     therefore ψ ( z ) ≥ 0. In the second case, z = a ( x − y ), therefore y = x − z / a . Let x 1 ∈ F be such that z 1 = y − x 1 ∈ K and ψ ( x 1 ) ≥ ψ( y ) − ε . Then         ψ   (  x  )    -   ψ   (   x  1   )     =   ψ   (   x  -   x  1    )    =   ψ   (    z  1   +   z  /  a    )    =   ϕ   (    z  1   +   z  /  a    )    ≥   0    ,            ψ  x     ψ   subscript  x  1       ψ    x   subscript  x  1            ψ     subscript  z  1     z  a            ϕ     subscript  z  1     z  a          0     \psi(x)-\psi(x_{1})=\psi(x-x_{1})=\psi(z_{1}+z/a)=\phi(z_{1}+z/a)\geq 0~{},     therefore ψ ( z ) ≥ − a  ε . Since this is true for arbitrary ε > 0, we obtain ψ ( z ) ≥ 0.  Corollary: Krein's extension theorem  Let E be a real  linear space , and let K ⊂ E be a convex cone . Let x ∈ E \(− K ) be such that R  x + K = E . Then there exists a K -positive linear functional φ : E → R such that φ ( x ) > 0.  Connection to the Hahn–Banach theorem  The Hahn–Banach theorem can be deduced from the M. Riesz extension theorem.  Let V be a linear space, and let N be a sublinear function on V . Let φ be a functional on a subspace U ⊂ V that is dominated by N :         ϕ   (  x  )    ≤   N   (  x  )     ,   x  ∈  U    .     formulae-sequence      ϕ  x     N  x      x  U     \phi(x)\leq N(x),\quad x\in U.     The Hahn–Banach theorem asserts that φ can be extended to a linear functional on V that is dominated by N .  To derive this from the M. Riesz extension theorem, define a convex cone K ⊂ R × V by       K  =   {   (  a  ,  x  )   ∣    N   (  x  )    ≤  a   }    .      K   conditional-set   a  x       N  x   a      K=\left\{(a,x)\,\mid\,N(x)\leq a\right\}.     Define a functional φ 1 on R × U by         ϕ  1    (  a  ,  x  )    =   a  -   ϕ   (  x  )      .         subscript  ϕ  1    a  x      a    ϕ  x      \phi_{1}(a,x)=a-\phi(x).     One can see that φ 1 is K -positive, and that K + ( R × U ) = R × V . Therefore φ 1 can be extended to a K -positive functional ψ 1 on R × V . Then       ψ   (  x  )    =   -    ψ  1    (  0  ,  x  )           ψ  x        subscript  ψ  1    0  x       \psi(x)=-\psi_{1}(0,x)     is the desired extension of φ . Indeed, if ψ ( x ) > N ( x ), we have: ( N ( x ), x ) ∈ K , whereas         ψ  1    (   N   (  x  )    ,  x  )    =    N   (  x  )    -   ψ   (  x  )     <  0   ,           subscript  ψ  1      N  x   x        N  x     ψ  x         0     \psi_{1}(N(x),x)=N(x)-\psi(x)<0,     leading to a contradiction.
