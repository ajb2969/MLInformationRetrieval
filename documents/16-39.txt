Phyllocladan-16alpha-ol synthase

Phyllocladan-16alpha-ol synthase (, PaDC1) is an enzyme with system name (+)-copalyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (phyllocladan-16alpha-ol-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(+)-copalyl diphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  phyllocladan-16alpha-ol + diphosphate


The adjacent gene PaDC2 codes EC 5.5.1.12, copalyl diphosphate synthase.
