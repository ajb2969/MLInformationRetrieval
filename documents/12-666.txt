   Archimedean circle      Archimedean circle   In geometry , an Archimedean circle is any circle constructed from an arbelos that has the same radius as each of Archimedes' twin circles . The radius ρ of such a circle is given by       ρ  =    1  2   r   (   1  -  r   )     ,      ρ      1  2   r    1  r      \rho=\frac{1}{2}r\left(1-r\right),   where r is the ratio AB / AC shown in the figure to the right. There are over fifty different known ways to construct Archimedean circles. 1  Origin  An Archimedean circle was first constructed by Archimedes in his Book of Lemmas . In his book, he constructed what is now known as Archimedes' twin circles .  Other Archimedean circles finders  Leon Bankoff  Leon Bankoff has constructed other Archimedean circles called Bankoff's triplet circle and Bankoff's quadruplet circle.  Thomas Schoch  In 1978 Thomas Schoch found a dozen more Archimedean circles (the Schoch circles ) that have been published in 1998. 2 3 He also constructed what is known as the Schoch line . 4  Peter Y. Woo  Peter Y. Woo considered the Schoch line, and with it, he was able to create a family of infinitely many Archimedean circles known as the Woo circles . 5  Frank Power  In the summer of 1998, Frank Power introduced four more Archimedes circles known as Archimedes' quadruplets . 6  References  "  Category:Arbelos     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
