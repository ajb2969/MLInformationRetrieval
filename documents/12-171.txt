It was introduced by Elliott H. Lieb in 1967. 1  Definition  An n × n grid graph (with periodic boundary conditions and n ≥ 2) has n 2 vertices and 2 n 2 edges; it is 4-regular , meaning that each vertex has exactly four neighbors. An orientation of this graph is an assignment of a direction to each edge; it is an Eulerian orientation if it gives each vertex exactly two incoming edges and exactly two outgoing edges. Denote the number of Eulerian orientations of this graph by f ( n ). Then        lim   n  →  ∞      f   (  n  )     n  2     =    (   4  3   )    3  2    =    8   3    9   =   1.5396007  …           subscript    normal-→  n         superscript  n  2      f  n      superscript    4  3     3  2             8    3    9          1.5396007  normal-…      \lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n^{2}]{f(n)}=\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}=%
