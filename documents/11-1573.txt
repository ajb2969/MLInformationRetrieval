   Phosphoglycerate kinase (GTP)      Phosphoglycerate kinase (GTP)   In enzymology , a phosphoglycerate kinase (GTP) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GTP + 3-phospho-D-glycerate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GDP + 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GTP and 3-phospho-D-glycerate , whereas its two products are GDP and 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with a carboxy group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GTP:3-phospho-D-glycerate 1-phosphotransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.7.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
