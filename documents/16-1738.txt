   Steiner conic      Steiner conic   The Steiner conic or more precisely Steiner's generation of a conic , named after the Swiss mathematician Jakob Steiner , is an alternative method to define a non-degenerate projective conic section in a projective plane over a field .  The usual definition of a conic uses a quadratic form (see Quadric (projective geometry) ). Another alternative definition of a conic uses a hyperbolic polarity . It is due to K. G. C. von Staudt and sometimes called a von Staudt conic . The disadvantage of von Staudt's definition is that it only works when the underlying field has odd characteristic (i.e.,     C  h  a  r   ≠  2        C  h  a  r   2    Char\neq 2   ).  Definition of a Steiner conic   Given two pencils     B   (  U  )    ,   B   (  V  )         B  U     B  V     B(U),B(V)   of lines at two points    U  ,  V     U  V    U,V   (all lines containing   U   U   U   and   V   V   V   resp.) and a projective but not perspective mapping   π   π   \pi   of    B   (  U  )       B  U    B(U)   onto    B   (  V  )       B  V    B(V)   . Then the intersection points of corresponding lines form a non-degenerate projective conic section 1 2 3  4 (figure 1)   A perspective mapping   π   π   \pi   of a pencil    B   (  U  )       B  U    B(U)   onto a pencil    B   (  V  )       B  V    B(V)   is a bijection (1-1 correspondence) such that corresponding lines intersect on a fixed line   a   a   a   , which is called the axis of the perspectivity   π   π   \pi   (figure 2).  A projective mapping is a finite sequence of perspective mappings.  Examples of commonly used fields are the real numbers    \R    \R   \R   , the rational numbers    \Q    \Q   \Q   or the complex numbers    \C    \C   \C   . The construction also works over finite fields, providing examples in finite projective planes .  Remark: The fundamental theorem for projective planes states, 5 that a projective mapping in a projective plane over a field (pappian plane) is uniquely determined by prescribing the images of three lines. That means that, for the Steiner generation of a conic section, besides two points    U  ,  V     U  V    U,V   only the images of 3 lines have to be given. These 5 items (2 points, 3 lines) uniquely determine the conic section.  Remark: The notation "perspective" is due to the dual statement: The projection of the points on a line   a   a   a   from a center   Z   Z   Z   onto a line   b   b   b   is called a perspectivity (see below ). 6  Example  For the following example the images of the lines    a  ,  u  ,  w     a  u  w    a,u,w   (see picture) are given      π   (  a  )    =  b   ,     π   (  u  )    =  w   ,    π   (  w  )    =  v       formulae-sequence      π  a   b    formulae-sequence      π  u   w       π  w   v      \pi(a)=b,\pi(u)=w,\pi(w)=v   . The projective mapping   π   π   \pi   is the product of the following perspective mappings     π  b   ,   π  a       subscript  π  b    subscript  π  a     \pi_{b},\pi_{a}   : 1)    π  b     subscript  π  b    \pi_{b}   is the perspective mapping of the pencil at point   U   U   U   onto the pencil at point   O   O   O   with axis   b   b   b   . 2)    π  a     subscript  π  a    \pi_{a}   is the perspective mapping of the pencil at point   O   O   O   onto the pencil at point   V   V   V   with axis   a   a   a   . First one should check that    π  =    π  a    π  b        π     subscript  π  a    subscript  π  b      \pi=\pi_{a}\pi_{b}   has the properties      π   (  a  )    =  b   ,     π   (  u  )    =  w   ,    π   (  w  )    =  v       formulae-sequence      π  a   b    formulae-sequence      π  u   w       π  w   v      \pi(a)=b,\pi(u)=w,\pi(w)=v   . Hence for any line   g   g   g   the image     π   (  g  )    =    π  a    π  b    (  g  )          π  g      subscript  π  a    subscript  π  b   g     \pi(g)=\pi_{a}\pi_{b}(g)   can be constructed and therefore the images of an arbitrary set of points. The lines   u   u   u   and   v   v   v   contain only the conic points   U   U   U   and   V   V   V   resp.. Hence   u   u   u   and   v   v   v   are tangent lines of the generated conic section.  A proof that this method generates a conic section follows from switching to the affine restriction with line   w   w   w   as the line at infinity , point   O   O   O   as the origin of a coordinate system with points    U  ,  V     U  V    U,V   as points at infinity of the x - and y -axis resp. and point    E  =   (  1  ,  1  )       E   1  1     E=(1,1)   . The affine part of the generated curve appears to be the hyperbola     y  =   1  /  x       y    1  x     y=1/x   . 7  Remark:   The Steiner generation of a conic section provides simple methods for the construction of ellipses , parabolas and hyperbolas which are commonly called the parallelogram methods .  The figure that appears while constructing a point (figure 3) is the 4-point-degeneration of Pascal's theorem . 8   Steiner generation of a dual conic    Definitions and the dual generation  Dualizing (see duality (projective geometry) ) a projective plane means exchanging the points with the lines and the operations intersection and connecting . The dual structure of a projective plane is also a projective plane. The dual plane of a pappian plane is pappian and can also be coordinatized by homogenous coordinates. A nondegenerate dual conic section is analogously defined by a quadratic form.  A dual conic can be generated by Steiner's dual method:   Given the point sets of two lines    u  ,  v     u  v    u,v   and a projective but not perspective mapping   π   π   \pi   of   u   u   u   onto   v   v   v   . Then the lines connecting corresponding points form a dual non-degenerate projective conic section.   A perspective mapping    π   π   \pi   of the point set of a line   u   u   u   onto the point set of a line   v   v   v   is a bijection (1-1 correspondence) such that the connecting lines of corresponding points intersect at a fixed point   Z   Z   Z   , which is called the centre of the perspectivity   π   π   \pi   (see figure).  A ''projective '' mapping is a finite sequence of perspective mappings.  It is usual, when dealing with dual and common conic sections, to call the common conic section a point conic and the dual conic a line conic .  In the case that the underlying field has     C  h  a  r   =  2        C  h  a  r   2    Char=2   all the tangents of a point conic intersect in a point, called the knot (or nucleus ) of the conic. Thus, the dual of a non-degenerate point conic is a subset of points of a dual line and not an oval curve (in the dual plane). So, only in the case that     C  h  a  r   ≠  2        C  h  a  r   2    Char\neq 2   is the dual of a non-degenerate point conic a non-degenerate line conic.  Example  For the following example the images of the points    A  ,  U  ,  W     A  U  W    A,U,W   are given      π   (  A  )    =  B   ,     π   (  U  )    =  W   ,    π   (  W  )    =  V       formulae-sequence      π  A   B    formulae-sequence      π  U   W       π  W   V      \pi(A)=B,\,\pi(U)=W,\,\pi(W)=V   . The projective mapping   π   π   \pi   can be represented by the product of the following perspectivities     π  B   ,   π  A       subscript  π  B    subscript  π  A     \pi_{B},\pi_{A}   :   1)    π  B     subscript  π  B    \pi_{B}   is the perspectivity of the point set of line   u   u   u   onto the point set of line   o   o   o   with centre   B   B   B   .  2)    π  A     subscript  π  A    \pi_{A}   is the perspectivity of the point set of line   o   o   o   onto the point set of line   v   v   v   with centre   A   A   A   .   One easily checks that the projective mapping    π  =    π  A    π  B        π     subscript  π  A    subscript  π  B      \pi=\pi_{A}\pi_{B}   fulfills      π   (  A  )    =  B   ,     π   (  U  )    =  W   ,    π   (  W  )    =  V       formulae-sequence      π  A   B    formulae-sequence      π  U   W       π  W   V      \pi(A)=B,\,\pi(U)=W,\,\pi(W)=V   . Hence for any arbitrary point   G   G   G   the image     π   (  G  )    =    π  A    π  B    (  G  )          π  G      subscript  π  A    subscript  π  B   G     \pi(G)=\pi_{A}\pi_{B}(G)   can be constructed and line     G  π   (  G  )    ¯     normal-¯    G  π  G     \overline{G\pi(G)}   is an element of a non degenerate dual conic section. Because the points   U   U   U   and   V   V   V   are contained in the lines   u   u   u   ,   v   v   v   resp.,the points   U   U   U   and   V   V   V   are points of the conic and the lines    u  ,  v     u  v    u,v   are tangents at    U  ,  V     U  V    U,V   .
