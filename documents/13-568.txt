Evidential decision theory

Evidential decision theory is a school of thought within decision theory according to which the best action is the one which, conditional on your having chosen it, gives you the best expectations for the outcome. It contrasts with causal decision theory, which requires a causal connection between your actions and the desirable outcome.
Description
In a 1981 article, Allan Gibbard and William Harper characterized evidential decision theory as maximization of the expected utility

 
  of an action 
 
 
 
  "calculated from conditional probabilities":1


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the desirability of outcome 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the conditional probability of 
 
 
 
  given 
 
 
 
 .
Criticism
David Lewis has characterized evidential decision theory as promoting "an irrational policy of managing the news".2 James M. Joyce asserted, "Rational agents choose acts on the basis of their causal efficacy, not their auspiciousness; they act to bring about good results even when doing so might betoken bad news."3
