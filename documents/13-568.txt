   Evidential decision theory      Evidential decision theory   Evidential decision theory is a school of thought within decision theory according to which the best action is the one which, conditional on your having chosen it, gives you the best expectations for the outcome. It contrasts with causal decision theory , which requires a causal connection between your actions and the desirable outcome.  Description  In a 1981 article, Allan Gibbard and William Harper characterized evidential decision theory as maximization of the expected utility    V   V   V   of an action   A   A   A   "calculated from conditional probabilities": 1      V   (  A  )   =   ∑  j   P   (   O  j   |  A  )   D   (   O  j   )   ,     fragments  V   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-)     subscript   j   P   fragments  normal-(   subscript  O  j   normal-|  A  normal-)   D   fragments  normal-(   subscript  O  j   normal-)   normal-,    V(A)=\sum\limits_{j}P(O_{j}|A)D(O_{j}),   where    D   (   O  j   )       D   subscript  O  j     D(O_{j})   is the desirability of outcome    O  j     subscript  O  j    O_{j}   and    P   (   O  j   |  A  )      fragments  P   fragments  normal-(   subscript  O  j   normal-|  A  normal-)     P(O_{j}|A)   is the conditional probability of    O  j     subscript  O  j    O_{j}   given   A   A   A   .  Criticism  David Lewis has characterized evidential decision theory as promoting "an irrational policy of managing the news". 2 James M. Joyce asserted, "Rational agents choose acts on the basis of their causal efficacy , not their auspiciousness; they act to bring about good results even when doing so might betoken bad news." 3  See also   Causal decision theory  Decision making  Expected utility hypothesis  Game theory  Newcomb's paradox   References  External links   Causal Decision Theory at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy   "       ↩  ↩  , p. 146 ↩
