   File:Illusion movie.ogg      File:Illusion movie.ogg   == Summary == To see the illusion, do this: Play the movie (which lasts 1 minute) full screen and stare to the center of the image. After the movie finishes, look away (for example look to a face or to your hands). For few seconds everything you see will appear to distort.  The original idea is not mine, I have seen on the net, BUT this animation file was created by me with this C program:  //License: Public Domain

 Steps to obtain the illusion image:
 
 1) Compile this program and run it
 
 2) Convert the .pgm images to .png images with the bash script:
 >>>>>cut<<<<<
 for file in *.pgm
 do
     echo $file
     pnmtopng $file > "$file.png"
     rm -f $file
 done
 >>>>>cut<<<<<
 
 3) Convert png images to "output.avi"
 mencoder "mf://*.png" -mf fps=20:type=png -ovc lavc -oac copy -o output.avi
 
 4) Convert "output.avi" to ogg theora with:
 ffmpeg2theora output.avi
 
 5) Run the animation (full screen) and look and stare in the center of it
 After 1 minute, look away and you'll see a very interesting illusion (looks like objects/faces/etc changes their shapes) which last few seconds.
