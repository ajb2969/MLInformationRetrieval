   Dynkin system      Dynkin system   A Dynkin system , named after Eugene Dynkin , is a collection of subsets of another universal set    Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   satisfying a set of axioms weaker than those of σ-algebra . Dynkin systems are sometimes referred to as λ-systems (Dynkin himself used this term) or d-system . 1 These set families have applications in measure theory and probability .  The primary relevance of λ-systems are their use in applications of the π-λ theorem.  Definitions  Let Ω be a nonempty set, and let   D   D   D   be a collection of subsets of Ω (i.e.,   D   D   D   is a subset of the power set of Ω). Then   D   D   D   is a Dynkin system if   Ω ∈   D   D   D   ,  if A , B ∈   D   D   D   and A ⊆ B , then B \ A ∈   D   D   D   ,  if A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , ... is a sequence of subsets in   D   D   D   and A n ⊆ A n +1 for all n ≥ 1, then      ⋃   n  =  1   ∞    A  n    ∈  D        superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  A  n    D    \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}\in D   .   Equivalently,   D   D   D   is a Dynkin system if   Ω ∈   D   D   D   ,  if A ∈ D , then A c ∈ D ,  if A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , ... is a sequence of subsets in   D   D   D   such that A i ∩ A j = Ø for all i ≠ j , then      ⋃   n  =  1   ∞    A  n    ∈  D        superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  A  n    D    \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}\in D   .   The second definition is generally preferred as it usually is easier to check.  An important fact is that a Dynkin system which is also a π-system (i.e., closed under finite intersection) is a σ-algebra . This can be verified by noting that condition 3 and closure under finite intersection implies closure under countable unions.  Given any collection   𝒥   𝒥   \mathcal{J}   of subsets of   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   , there exists a unique Dynkin system denoted    D   {  𝒥  }       D   𝒥     D\{\mathcal{J}\}   which is minimal with respect to containing   𝒥   𝒥   \mathcal{J}   . That is, if    D  ~     normal-~  D    \tilde{D}   is any Dynkin system containing   𝒥   𝒥   \mathcal{J}   , then     D   {  𝒥  }    ⊆   D  ~         D   𝒥     normal-~  D     D\{\mathcal{J}\}\subseteq\tilde{D}   .    D   {  𝒥  }       D   𝒥     D\{\mathcal{J}\}   is called the Dynkin system generated by   𝒥   𝒥   \mathcal{J}   . Note     D   {  ∅  }    =   {  ∅  ,  Ω  }         D        normal-Ω     D\{\emptyset\}=\{\emptyset,\Omega\}   . For another example, let    Ω  =   {  1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  4  }       normal-Ω   1  2  3  4     \Omega=\{1,2,3,4\}   and    𝒥  =   {  1  }       𝒥   1     \mathcal{J}=\{1\}   ; then     D   {  𝒥  }    =   {  ∅  ,   {  1  }   ,   {  2  ,  3  ,  4  }   ,  Ω  }         D   𝒥       1    2  3  4   normal-Ω     D\{\mathcal{J}\}=\{\emptyset,\{1\},\{2,3,4\},\Omega\}   .  Dynkin's π-λ theorem  If   P   P   P   is a π-system and   D   D   D   is a Dynkin system with    P  ⊆  D      P  D    P\subseteq D   , then     σ   {  P  }    ⊆  D        σ   P    D    \sigma\{P\}\subseteq D   . In other words, the σ-algebra generated by   P   P   P   is contained in   D   D   D   .  One application of Dynkin's π-λ theorem is the uniqueness of a measure that evaluates the length of an interval (known as the Lebesgue measure ):  Let (Ω, B , λ ) be the unit interval [0,1] with the Lebesgue measure on Borel sets . Let μ be another measure on Ω satisfying μ[( a , b )] = b − a , and let D be the family of sets S such that μ[S] = λ[S]. Let I = { ( a , b ),[ a , b ),( a , b ],[ a , b ] : 0  References       "  Category:Set families  Category:Probability theory  Category:Lemmas     ↩
