Big q-Legendre polynomials

In mathematics, the big q-Legendre polynomials are an orthogonal family of polynomials defined in terms of Heine's basic hypergeometric series as1


 
 .
They obey the orthogonality relation



and have the limiting behavior



where 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
 th Legendre polynomial.
