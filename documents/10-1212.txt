   Glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase      Glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase   In enzymology , a glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   sn-glycerol 3-phosphate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycerone phosphate + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sn- glycerol 3-phosphate and O 2 , whereas its two products are glycerone phosphate and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sn-glycerol-3-phosphate:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include glycerol phosphate oxidase , glycerol-1-phosphate oxidase , glycerol phosphate oxidase , L-alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase , alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase , and L-alpha-glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase . This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism . It employs one cofactor , FAD .  References      "  Category:EC 1.1.3  Category:Flavin enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
