Glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase




Glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase

In enzymology, a glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

sn-glycerol 3-phosphate + O2

 
  glycerone phosphate + H2O2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and O2, whereas its two products are glycerone phosphate and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sn-glycerol-3-phosphate:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include glycerol phosphate oxidase, glycerol-1-phosphate oxidase, glycerol phosphate oxidase, L-alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase, alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase, and L-alpha-glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase. This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism. It employs one cofactor, FAD.
