<p>A <strong>proof of impossibility</strong>, sometimes called a <em>negative proof</em> or <em>negative result</em>, is a proof demonstrating that a particular problem cannot be solved, or cannot be solved in general. Often proofs of impossibility have put to rest decades or centuries of work attempting to find a solution. Proofs of impossibility are usually expressible as universal propositions in logic (see <a href="universal_quantification" title="wikilink">universal quantification</a>).</p>

<p>One of the most famous proofs of impossibility was the 1882 proof of <a href="Ferdinand_von_Lindemann" title="wikilink">Ferdinand von Lindemann</a> showing that the ancient problem of <a href="squaring_the_circle" title="wikilink">squaring the circle</a> cannot be solved, because the number <a href="Pi" title="wikilink">

</a> is <a href="Transcendental_number" title="wikilink">transcendental</a> (non-algebraic) and only a subset of the <a href="algebraic_numbers" title="wikilink">algebraic numbers</a> can be constructed by compass and straightedge. Two other classical problems--<a href="trisection" title="wikilink">trisecting the general angle</a> and <a href="doubling_the_cube" title="wikilink">doubling the cube</a>—were also proved impossible in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>A problem arising in the sixteenth century was that of creating a general formula using radicals expressing the solution of any polynomial equation of degree 5 or higher. In the 1820s the <a href="Abel-Ruffini_theorem" title="wikilink">Abel-Ruffini theorem</a> showed this to be impossible using concepts such as <a href="solvable_group" title="wikilink">solvable groups</a> from <a href="Galois_theory" title="wikilink">Galois theory</a>, a new subfield of <a href="abstract_algebra" title="wikilink">abstract algebra</a>.</p>

<p>Among the most important proofs of impossibility of the 20th century were those related to <a href="undecidable_problem" title="wikilink">undecidability</a>, which showed that there are problems that cannot be solved in general by any algorithm at all. The most famous is the <a href="halting_problem" title="wikilink">halting problem</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="computational_complexity_theory" title="wikilink">computational complexity theory</a>, techniques like relativization (see <a href="oracle_machine" title="wikilink">oracle machine</a>) provide "weak" proofs of impossibility excluding certain proof techniques. Other techniques like proofs of completeness for a <a href="complexity_class" title="wikilink">complexity class</a> provide evidence for the difficulty of problems by showing them to be just as hard to solve as other known problems that have proven intractable.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-impossibility-proof">Types of impossibility proof</h2>
<h3 id="proof-by-contradiction">Proof by contradiction</h3>

<p>One widely used type of impossibility proof is <a href="proof_by_contradiction" title="wikilink">proof by contradiction</a>. In this type of proof it is shown that if something, such as a solution to a particular class of equations, were possible, then two mutually contradictory things would be true, such as a number being both even and odd. The contradiction implies that the original premise is impossible.</p>
<h4 id="proof-by-descent">Proof by descent</h4>

<p>One type of proof by contradiction is proof by <a href="infinite_descent" title="wikilink">descent</a>. Here it is postulated that something is possible, such as a solution to a class of equations, and that therefore there must be a smallest solution; then starting from the allegedly smallest solution, it is shown that a smaller solution can be found, contradicting the premise that the former solution was the smallest one possible. Thus the premise that a solution exists must be false.</p>

<p>This method of proof can also be interpreted slightly differently, as the method of <em>infinite descent</em>. One postulates that a positive integer solution exists, whether or not it is the smallest one, and one shows that based on this solution a smaller solution must exist. But by <a href="mathematical_induction" title="wikilink">mathematical induction</a> it follows that a still smaller solution must exist, then a yet smaller one, and so on for an infinite number of steps. But this contradicts the fact that one cannot find smaller and smaller positive integers indefinitely; the contradiction implies that the premise that a solution exists is wrong.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-disproof-of-impossibility-conjectures">Types of disproof of impossibility conjectures</h2>

<p>There are two alternative methods of proving wrong a conjecture that something is impossible. The obvious one is a proof by <a class="uri" href="counterexample" title="wikilink">counterexample</a>. For example, <a href="Euler's_sum_of_powers_conjecture" title="wikilink">Euler's sum of powers conjecture</a> was disproven by counterexample. It asserted that at least <em>n</em> <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> powers were necessary to sum to another <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> power. The conjecture was disproven in 1966 with a counterexample involving <em>n</em>=5: specifically, 27<sup>5</sup> + 84<sup>5</sup> + 110<sup>5</sup> + 133<sup>5</sup> = 144<sup>5</sup>. A proof by counterexample is a <a href="constructive_proof" title="wikilink">constructive proof</a>.</p>

<p>In contrast, a <a href="non-constructive_proof" title="wikilink">non-constructive proof</a> that something is not impossible proceeds by showing it is logically contradictory for all possible counterexamples to be invalid: at least one of them must be an actual counterexample to the impossibility conjecture. For example, a conjecture that it is impossible for an irrational power raised to an irrational power to be rational <a href="Irrational_number#Irrational_powers" title="wikilink">was disproven</a> by showing that one of two possible counterexamples must be a valid counterexample, without showing which one it is.</p>
<h2 id="the-existence-of-irrational-numbers-the-pythagoreans-proof">The existence of irrational numbers: The Pythagoreans' proof</h2>

<p>The proof by <a class="uri" href="Pythagoras" title="wikilink">Pythagoras</a> or his students that the <a href="square_root_of_2" title="wikilink">square root of 2</a> cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers (counting numbers) has had a profound effect on mathematics: it bifurcated "the numbers" into two non-overlapping collections—the <a href="rational_numbers" title="wikilink">rational numbers</a> and the <a href="irrational_numbers" title="wikilink">irrational numbers</a>. This bifurcation was used by <a href="Georg_Cantor" title="wikilink">Cantor</a> in his <a href="Cantor's_diagonal_argument" title="wikilink">diagonal method</a>, which in turn was used by Turing in his proof that the <em><a class="uri" href="Entscheidungsproblem" title="wikilink">Entscheidungsproblem</a></em> (the <a href="decision_problem" title="wikilink">decision problem</a> of <a href="David_Hilbert" title="wikilink">Hilbert</a>) is undecidable.</p>

<p>About 500 BC "It is unknown when, or by whom, the 'theorem of Pythagoras' was discovered. 'The discovery', says Heath, 'can hardly have been made by Pythagoras himself, but it was certainly made in his school.' Pythagoras lived about 570-490. Democritus, born about 470, wrote 'on irrational lines and solids'..."</p>

<p>Proofs followed for various square roots of the primes up to 17. "There is a famous passage in Plato's <em>Theaetetus</em> in which it is stated that Teodorus (Plato's teacher) proved the irrationality of</p>

 'taking all the separate cases up to the root of 17 square feet..." (Hardy and Wright, p. 42).</p>

<p>A more general proof now exists that:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The <em>m</em>th root of an integer <em>N</em> is irrational, unless <em>N</em> is the <em>m</em>th power of an integer <em>n</em>" (Hardy and Wright, p. 40).
</dd>
</dl>

<p>That is, it is impossible to express the <em>m</em>th root of an integer <em>N</em> as the ratio <em>a</em>/<em>b</em> of two integers <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> that share no common <a href="prime_factor" title="wikilink">prime factor</a> except in cases in which <em>b</em>=1.</p>
<h2 id="impossible-constructions-sought-by-the-ancient-greeks">Impossible constructions sought by the ancient Greeks</h2>

<p>Three famous questions of <a href="compass_and_straightedge_constructions" title="wikilink">Greek geometry</a> were:</p>
<ol>
<li>"...with compass and straight-edge to <a href="trisect_any_angle" title="wikilink">trisect any angle</a>,</li>
<li>to construct a cube with a volume <a href="Doubling_the_cube" title="wikilink">twice the volume of a given cube</a>, <em>and</em></li>
<li>to construct a square <a href="squaring_the_circle" title="wikilink">equal in area</a> to that of a given circle.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more than 2,000 years unsuccessful attempts were made to solve these problems; at last, in the nineteenth century it was proved that the desired constructions are logically impossible" (Nagel and Newman p. 8).</p>

<p>A fourth problem of the ancient Greeks was to construct an <a href="equilateral_polygon" title="wikilink">equilateral polygon</a> with a specified number <em>n</em> of sides, beyond the basic cases <em>n</em>=3, 4, 5 that they knew how to construct.</p>

<p>All of these are problems in <a href="Constructible_number" title="wikilink">Euclidean construction</a>, and Euclidean constructions can be done only if they involve only <a href="Euclidean_number" title="wikilink">Euclidean numbers</a> (by definition of the latter) (Hardy and Wright p. 159). Irrational numbers can be Euclidean. A good example is the irrational number the square root of 2. It is simply the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs both one unit in length, and it can be constructed with straightedge and compass. But it was proved centuries after Euclid that Euclidean numbers cannot involve any operations other than addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the extraction of square roots.</p>
<h3 id="angle-trisection-and-doubling-the-cube">Angle trisection and doubling the cube</h3>

<p>Both <a href="trisecting_the_angle" title="wikilink">trisecting the general angle</a> and <a href="doubling_the_cube" title="wikilink">doubling the cube</a> require taking <a href="cube_root" title="wikilink">cube roots</a>, which are not <a href="constructible_numbers" title="wikilink">constructible numbers</a> by compass and straightedge.</p>
<h3 id="squaring-the-circle">Squaring the circle</h3>

<p>"π is not a 'Euclidean' number ... and therefore it is impossible to construct, by Euclidean methods a length equal to the circumference of a circle of unit diameter" (Hardy and Wright p. 176)</p>

<p>A proof exists to demonstrate that any Euclidean number is an <a href="algebraic_number" title="wikilink">algebraic number</a>—a number that is the solution to some <a href="polynomial_equation" title="wikilink">polynomial equation</a>. Therefore, because π was proven in 1882 to be a <a href="transcendental_number" title="wikilink">transcendental number</a> and thus by definition not an algebraic number, it is not a Euclidean number. Hence the construction of a length π from a unit circle is impossible [Hardy and Wright p. 159 reference E. Hecke <em>Vorlesungen über die Theorie der algebraischen Zahlen</em> (Leipzig, Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft, 1923)], and the circle cannot be squared.</p>
<h3 id="constructing-an-equilateral-n-gon">Constructing an equilateral <em>n</em>-gon</h3>

<p>The <a href="Constructible_polygon#Conditions_for_constructibility" title="wikilink">Gauss-Wantzel theorem</a> showed in 1837 that constructing an equilateral <em>n</em>-gon is impossible for most values of <em>n</em>.</p>
<h2 id="euclids-parallel-axiom">Euclid's parallel axiom</h2>

<p>Nagel and Newman consider the question raised by the <a href="parallel_postulate" title="wikilink">parallel postulate</a> to be "...perhaps the most significant development in its long-range effects upon subsequent mathematical history" (p. 9).</p>

<p>The question is: can the axiom that two parallel lines "...will not meet even 'at infinity'" (footnote, ibid) be derived from the other axioms of Euclid's geometry? It was not until work in the nineteenth century by "... Gauss, Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Riemann, that the impossibility of deducing the parallel axiom from the others was demonstrated. This outcome was of the greatest intellectual importance. ...a <em>proof</em> can be given of the <em>impossibility of proving</em> certain propositions [in this case, the parallel postlate] within a given system [in this case, Euclid's first four postulates]". (p. 10)</p>

A succinct definition is found in <em><a href="Principia_Mathematica" title="wikilink">Principia Mathematica</a></em>:</p>

Let N be a number defined as follows [Whitehead &amp; Russell now employ the Cantor diagonal method]; If the <em>n</em>th figure in the <em>n</em>th decimal is <em>p</em>, let the <em>n</em>th figure in N be <em>p</em>+1 (or 0, if <em>p</em> = 9). Then N is different from all the members of E, since, whatever finite value <em>n</em> may have, the <em>n</em>th figure in N is different from the <em>n</em>th figure in the <em>n</em>th of the decimals composing E, and therefore N is different from the <em>n</em>th decimal. Nevertheless we have defined N in a finite number of words [i.e. this very word-definition just above!] and therefore N ought to be a member of E.

<p>Kurt Gödel considered his proof to be "an analogy" of Richard's paradox (he called it "Richard's antinomy") (Gödel in Undecidable, p. 9). See more below about Gödel's proof.</p>

<p>Alan <a class="uri" href="Turing" title="wikilink">Turing</a> constructed this paradox with a machine and proved that this machine could not answer a simple question: will this machine be able to determine if any machine (including itself) will become trapped in an unproductive "infinite loop" (i.e. it fails to continue its computation of the diagonal number).</p>
<h2 id="can-this-theorem-be-proven-from-these-axioms-gödels-proof">Can this theorem be proven from these axioms? Gödel's proof</h2>

<p>To quote Nagel and Newman (p. 68), "Gödel's paper is difficult. Forty-six preliminary definitions, together with several important preliminary theorems, must be mastered before the main results are reached" (p. 68). In fact, Nagel and Newman required a 67-page introduction to their exposition of the proof. But if the reader feels strong enough to tackle the paper, Martin Davis observes that "This remarkable paper is not only an intellectual landmark, but is written with a clarity and vigor that makes it a pleasure to read" (Davis in Undecidable, p. 4). It is recommended that most readers see Nagel and Newman first.</p>

<p>So what did Gödel prove? In his own words:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"It is reasonable… to make the conjecture that ...[the] axioms [from <a href="Principia_Mathematica" title="wikilink">Principia Mathematica</a> and <a class="uri" href="Peano" title="wikilink">Peano</a> ] are ... sufficient to decide all mathematical questions which can be formally expressed in the given systems. In what follows it will be shown that this is not the case, but rather that ... there exist relatively simple problems of the theory of ordinary whole numbers which cannot be decided on the basis of the axioms" (Gödel in Undecidable, p. 4).
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Gödel compared his proof to "Richard's antinomy" (an "<a class="uri" href="antinomy" title="wikilink">antinomy</a>" is a contradiction or a paradox; for more see <a href="Richard's_paradox" title="wikilink">Richard's paradox</a>):</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The analogy of this result with Richard's antinomy is immediately evident; there is also a close relationship [14] with the <a href="Liar_Paradox" title="wikilink">Liar Paradox</a> (Gödel's footnote 14: Every <a class="uri" href="epistemological" title="wikilink">epistemological</a> antinomy can be used for a similar proof of undecidability)... Thus we have a proposition before us which asserts its own unprovability [15]. (His footnote 15: Contrary to appearances, such a proposition is not circular, for, to begin with, it asserts the unprovability of a quite definite formula)" (Gödel in Undecidable, p.9).

<h2 id="will-this-computing-machine-lock-in-a-circle-turings-first-proof">Will this computing machine lock in a "circle"? Turing's first proof</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <em><a class="uri" href="Entscheidungsproblem" title="wikilink">Entscheidungsproblem</a></em>, the <a href="decision_problem" title="wikilink">decision problem</a>, was first answered by Church in April 1935 and preempted Turing by over a year, as Turing's paper was received for publication in May 1936. (Also received for publication in 1936—in October, later than Turing's—was a short paper by Emil Post that discussed the reduction of an algorithm to a simple machine-like "method" very similar to Turing's computing machine model (see <a href="Post-Turing_machine" title="wikilink">Post-Turing machine</a> for details).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Turing's proof is made difficult by number of definitions required and its subtle nature. See <a href="Turing_machine" title="wikilink">Turing machine</a> and <a href="Turing's_proof" title="wikilink">Turing's proof</a> for details.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Turing's first proof (of three) follows the schema of Richard's Paradox: Turing's computing machine is an algorithm represented by a string of seven letters in a "computing machine". Its "computation" is to test <em>all</em> computing machines (including itself) for "circles", and form a diagonal number from the computations of the non-circular or "successful" computing machines. It does this, starting in sequence from 1, by converting the numbers (base 8) into strings of seven letters to test. When it arrives at its own number, it creates <em>its own</em> letter-string. It decides it is the letter-string of a successful machine, but when it tries to do this machine's (<em>its own</em>) computation it locks in a circle and can't continue. Thus we have arrived at Richard's paradox. (If you are bewildered see Turing's proof for more).</li>
</ul>

<p>A number of similar undecidability proofs appeared soon before and after Turing's proof:</p>
<ol>
<li>April 1935: Proof of <a href="Alonzo_Church" title="wikilink">Alonzo Church</a> (<em>An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory</em>). His proof was to "...propose a definition of effective calculability ... and to show, by means of an example, that not every problem of this class is solvable" (Undecidable p. 90))</li>

While <a href="Kolmogorov_complexity#Compression" title="wikilink">most strings are random</a>, no particular one can be proven so, except for finitely many short ones:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"A paraphrase of Chaitin's result is that there can be no formal proof that a sufficiently long string is random..." (Beltrami p. 109)
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Beltrami observes that "Chaitin's proof is related to a paradox posed by Oxford librarian G. Berry early in the twentieth century that asks for 'the smallest positive integer than cannot be defined by an English sentence with fewer than 1000 characters.' Evidently, the shortest definition of this number must have at least 1000 characters. However, the sentence within quotation marks, which is itself a definition of the alleged number is less than 1000 characters in length!" (Beltrami, p. 108)</p>

<p>The question "Does any arbitrary "Diophantine equation" have an integer solution?" is <a href="Undecidable_problem" title="wikilink">undecidable</a>.That is, it is impossible to answer the question for all cases.</p>

<p>Franzén introduces <a href="Hilbert's_tenth_problem" title="wikilink">Hilbert's tenth problem</a> and the <a href="Matiyasevich's_theorem" title="wikilink">MRDP theorem</a> (Matiyasevich-Robinson-Davis-Putnam theorem) which states that "no algorithm exists which can decide whether or not a Diophantine equation has <em>any</em> solution at all". MRDP uses the undecidability proof of Turing: "... the set of solvable Diophantine equations is an example of a computably enumerable but not decidable set, and the set of unsolvable Diophantine equations is not computably enumerable" (p. 71).</p>

<p>In <a href="political_science" title="wikilink">political science</a>, <a href="Arrow's_impossibility_theorem" title="wikilink">Arrow's impossibility theorem</a> states that it is impossible to devise a <a href="voting_system" title="wikilink">voting system</a> that satisfies a set of five specific axioms. This theorem is proven by showing that four of the axioms together imply the opposite of the fifth.</p>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="economics" title="wikilink">economics</a>, <a href="Holmström's_theorem" title="wikilink">Holmström's theorem</a> is an impossibility theorem proving that no incentive system for a team of agents can satisfy all of three desirable criteria.</p>
<h2 id="in-natural-science">In natural science</h2>

<p>In <a href="natural_science" title="wikilink">natural science</a>, impossibility assertions (like other assertions) come to be widely accepted as overwhelmingly probable rather than considered proven to the point of being unchallengeable. The basis for this strong acceptance is a combination of extensive evidence of something not occurring, combined with an underlying theory, very successful in making predictions, whose assumptions lead logically to the conclusion that something is impossible.</p>

<p>Two examples of widely accepted impossibilities in <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a> are <a href="perpetual_motion_machine" title="wikilink">perpetual motion machines</a>, which violate the law of <a href="conservation_of_energy" title="wikilink">conservation of energy</a>, and exceeding the <a href="speed_of_light" title="wikilink">speed of light</a>, which violates the implications of <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a>. Another is the <a href="uncertainty_principle" title="wikilink">uncertainty principle</a> of <a href="quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum mechanics</a>, which asserts the impossibility of simultaneously knowing both the position and the momentum of a particle.</p>

<p>While an impossibility assertion in science can never be absolutely proven, it could be refuted by the observation of a single <a class="uri" href="counterexample" title="wikilink">counterexample</a>. Such a counterexample would require that the assumptions underlying the theory that implied the impossibility be re-examined.</p>
