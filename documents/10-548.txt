   Indanol dehydrogenase      Indanol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , an indanol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   indan-1-ol + NAD(P)+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   indanone + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are indan-1-ol , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are indanone , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is indan-1-ol:NAD(P) + 1-oxidoreductase .
