   Geometric–harmonic mean      Geometric–harmonic mean   In mathematics , the geometric–harmonic mean M( x , y ) of two positive real numbers  x and y is defined as follows: we form the geometric mean of g 0 = x and h 0 = y and call it g 1 , i.e. g 1 is the square root of xy . We also form the harmonic mean of x and y and call it h 1 , i.e. h 1 is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of x and y . These may be done sequentially (in any order) or simultaneously.  Now we can iterate this operation with g 1 taking the place of x and h 1 taking the place of y . In this way, two sequences ( g n ) and ( h n ) are defined:       g   n  +  1    =     g  n    h  n          subscript  g    n  1         subscript  g  n    subscript  h  n       g_{n+1}=\sqrt{g_{n}h_{n}}     and       h   n  +  1    =   2    1   g  n    +   1   h  n           subscript  h    n  1      2      1   subscript  g  n      1   subscript  h  n        h_{n+1}=\frac{2}{\frac{1}{g_{n}}+\frac{1}{h_{n}}}     Both of these sequences converge to the same number, which we call the geometric–harmonic mean M( x , y ) of x and y . The geometric–harmonic mean is also designated as the harmonic–geometric mean . (cf. Wolfram MathWorld below.)  The existence of the limit can be proved by the means of Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem in a manner almost identical to the proof of existence of arithmetic–geometric mean .  Properties  M( x , y ) is a number between the geometric and harmonic mean of x and y ; in particular it is between x and y . M( x , y ) is also homogeneous , i.e. if r > 0, then M( rx , ry ) = r M( x , y ).  If AG( x , y ) is the arithmetic–geometric mean , then we also have       M   (  x  ,  y  )    =   1   A  G   (   1  x   ,   1  y   )           M   x  y      1    A  G     1  x     1  y        M(x,y)=\frac{1}{AG(\frac{1}{x},\frac{1}{y})}     Inequalities  We have the following inequality involving the Pythagorean means { H , G , A } and iterated Pythagorean means { HG , HA , GA }:       min   (  x  ,  y  )    ≤   H   (  x  ,  y  )    ≤   H  G   (  x  ,  y  )    ≤   G   (  x  ,  y  )    ≤   G  A   (  x  ,  y  )    ≤   A   (  x  ,  y  )    ≤   max   (  x  ,  y  )            x  y     H   x  y           H  G   x  y           G   x  y           G  A   x  y           A   x  y           x  y      \min(x,y)\leq H(x,y)\leq HG(x,y)\leq G(x,y)\leq GA(x,y)\leq A(x,y)\leq\max(x,y)     where the iterated Pythagorean means have been identified with their parts { H , G , A } in progressing order:   H ( x , y ) is the harmonic mean,  HG ( x , y ) is the harmonic–geometric mean,  G ( x , y ) = HA ( x , y ) is the geometric mean (which is also the harmonic–arithmetic mean),  GA ( x , y ) is the geometric–arithmetic mean,  A ( x , y ) is the arithmetic mean.
