   4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase      4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase   In enzymology , a 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + 2-phospho-4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol , whereas its two products are ADP and 2-phospho-4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2-phosphotransferase . This enzyme is also called CDP-ME kinase . This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of steroids .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
