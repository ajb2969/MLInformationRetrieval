Continuous q-Laguerre polynomials

In mathematics, the continuous q-Laguerre polynomials are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme.  give a detailed list of their properties.
Definition
The polynomials are given in terms of basic hypergeometric functions and the Pochhammer symbol by ]]1。




Orthogonality
Recurrence and difference relations
Rodrigues formula
Generating function
