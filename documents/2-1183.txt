   Unitary operator      Unitary operator   In functional analysis , a branch of mathematics , a unitary operator (not to be confused with a unity operator) is defined as follows:  Definition 1. A bounded linear operator  $U : H → H$ on a Hilbert space  $H$ is called a unitary operator if it satisfies $U * U = UU * = I$ , where $U *$ is the adjoint of $U$ , and $I : H → H$ is the identity operator.  The weaker condition $U * U = I$ defines an isometry . The other condition, $UU * = I$ , defines a coisometry . Thus a unitary operator is a bounded linear operator which is both an isometry and a coisometry. 1  An equivalent definition is the following:  Definition 2. A bounded linear operator  $U : H → H$ on a Hilbert space  $H$ is called a unitary operator if:   $U$ is surjective , and  $U$ preserves the inner product of the Hilbert space, $H$ . In other words, for all vectors  $x$ and $y$ in $H$ we have:     $\langle Ux, Uy \rangle_H = \langle x, y \rangle_H.$      The following, seemingly weaker, definition is also equivalent:  Definition 3. A bounded linear operator  $U : H → H$ on a Hilbert space  $H$ is called a unitary operator if:   the range of $U$ is dense in $H$ , and  $U$ preserves the inner product of the Hilbert space, $H$ . In other words, for all vectors  $x$ and $y$ in $H$ we have:     $\langle Ux, Uy \rangle_H = \langle x, y \rangle_H.$      To see that Definitions 1 & 3 are equivalent, notice that $U$ preserving the inner product implies $U$ is an isometry (thus, a bounded linear operator ). The fact that $U$ has dense range ensures it has a bounded inverse . It is clear that  U *}} .  Thus, unitary operators are just automorphisms of Hilbert spaces , i.e., they preserve the structure (in this case, the linear space structure, the inner product, and hence the topology ) of the space on which they act. The group of all unitary operators from a given Hilbert space $H$ to itself is sometimes referred to as the Hilbert group of $H$ , denoted $Hilb( H )$ .  A unitary element is a generalization of a unitary operator. In a unital  *-algebra , an element $U$ of the algebra is called a unitary element if $U * U = UU * = I$ , where $I$ is the identity element. 2  Examples   The identity function is trivially a unitary operator.    Rotations in are the simplest nontrivial example of unitary operators. Rotations do not change the length of a vector or the angle between two vectors. This example can be expanded to .    On the vector space  $\mathbf{ C } $ of complex numbers , multiplication by a number of absolute value  $1$ , that is, a number of the form for $θ ∈ \mathbf{ R } $ , is a unitary operator. $θ$ is referred to as a phase, and this multiplication is referred to as multiplication by a phase. Notice that the value of $θ$ modulo $2 π$ does not affect the result of the multiplication, and so the independent unitary operators on $\mathbf{ C } $ are parametrized by a circle. The corresponding group, which, as a set, is the circle, is called $$ .    More generally, unitary matrices are precisely the unitary operators on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces , so the notion of a unitary operator is a generalization of the notion of a unitary matrix. Orthogonal matrices are the special case of unitary matrices in which all entries are real. They are the unitary operators on .    The bilateral shift on the sequence space  indexed by the integers is unitary. In general, any operator in a Hilbert space which acts by shuffling around an orthonormal basis is unitary. In the finite dimensional case, such operators are the permutation matrices . The unilateral shift is an isometry; its conjugate is a coisometry.    The Fourier operator is a unitary operator, i.e. the operator which performs the Fourier transform (with proper normalization). This follows from Parseval's theorem .    Unitary operators are used in unitary representations .   Linearity  The linearity requirement in the definition of a unitary operator can be dropped without changing the meaning because it can be derived from linearity and positive-definiteness of the scalar product :  $$\begin{align}
 \| \lambda U(x) -U(\lambda x) \|^2 &= \langle \lambda U(x) -U(\lambda x), \lambda U(x)-U(\lambda x) \rangle \\
 &= \| \lambda U(x) \|^2 + \| U(\lambda x) \|^2 - \langle U(\lambda x), \lambda  U(x) \rangle - \langle \lambda U(x), U(\lambda  x) \rangle \\
 &= |\lambda|^2 \| U(x)\|^2 + \| U(\lambda x) \|^2 - \overline{\lambda} \langle U(\lambda x), U(x) \rangle - \lambda  \langle U(x), U(\lambda x) \rangle \\
 &= |\lambda|^2 \| x \|^2 + \| \lambda x \|^2 - \overline{\lambda} \langle \lambda x, x \rangle - \lambda \langle x, \lambda x \rangle \\
 &= 0
 \end{align}$$  Analogously you obtain  $$\| U(x+y)-(Ux+Uy)\| = 0.$$  Properties   The spectrum of a unitary operator $U$ lies on the unit circle. That is, for any complex number $λ$ in the spectrum, one has $| λ | = 1$ . This can be seen as a consequence of the spectral theorem for normal operators . By the theorem, $U$ is unitarily equivalent to multiplication by a Borel-measurable $f$ on , for some finite measure space $( X , μ )$ . Now $UU * = I$ implies f ( x ){{!}} 2 {{=}} 1}} , $μ$ -a.e. This shows that the essential range of $f$ , therefore the spectrum of $U$ , lies on the unit circle.    A linear map is unitary iff it is surjective and isometric.
