   Peres–Horodecki criterion      Peres–Horodecki criterion   The Peres–Horodecki criterion is a necessary condition, for the joint density matrix    ρ   ρ   \rho   of two quantum mechanical systems   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   , to be separable . It is also called the PPT criterion, for positive partial transpose . In the 2x2 and 2x3 dimensional cases the condition is also sufficient. It is used to decide the separability of mixed states , where the Schmidt decomposition does not apply.  In higher dimensions, the test is inconclusive, and one should supplement it with more advanced tests, such as those based on entanglement witnesses .  Definition  If we have a general state   ρ   ρ   \rho   which acts on     ℋ  A   ⊗   ℋ  B      tensor-product   subscript  ℋ  A    subscript  ℋ  B     \mathcal{H}_{A}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{B}         ρ  =    ∑   i  j  k  l      p   k  l    i  j     |  i  ⟩    ⟨  j  |  ⊗  |  k  ⟩    ⟨  l  |         ρ    subscript     i  j  k  l       subscript   superscript  p    i  j      k  l     ket  i    quantum-operator-product  j  tensor-product  k    bra  l       \rho=\sum_{ijkl}p^{ij}_{kl}|i\rangle\langle j|\otimes|k\rangle\langle l|     Its partial transpose (with respect to the B party) is defined as       ρ   T  B    :=    I  ⊗  T    (  ρ  )    =    ∑   i  j  k  l       p   k  l    i  j     |  i  ⟩    ⟨  j  |    ⊗    (    |  k  ⟩    ⟨  l  |    )   T     =    ∑   i  j  k  l      p   k  l    i  j     |  i  ⟩    ⟨  j  |  ⊗  |  l  ⟩    ⟨  k  |          assign   superscript  ρ   subscript  T  B       tensor-product  I  T   ρ          subscript     i  j  k  l     tensor-product     subscript   superscript  p    i  j      k  l     ket  i    bra  j     superscript     ket  k    bra  l    T            subscript     i  j  k  l       subscript   superscript  p    i  j      k  l     ket  i    quantum-operator-product  j  tensor-product  l    bra  k        \rho^{T_{B}}:=I\otimes T(\rho)=\sum_{ijkl}p^{ij}_{kl}|i\rangle\langle j|%
 \otimes(|k\rangle\langle l|)^{T}=\sum_{ijkl}p^{ij}_{kl}|i\rangle\langle j|%
 \otimes|l\rangle\langle k|     Note that the partial in the name implies that only part of the state is transposed. More precisely,     I  ⊗  T    (  ρ  )        tensor-product  I  T   ρ    I\otimes T(\rho)   is the identity map applied to the A party and the transposition map applied to the B party.  This definition can be seen more clearly if we write the state as a block matrix:      ρ  =   (      A  11      A  12     …     A   1  n         A  21      A  22             ⋮       ⋱          A   n  1             A   n  n       )       ρ     subscript  A  11    subscript  A  12   normal-…   subscript  A    1  n       subscript  A  21    subscript  A  22   absent  absent    normal-⋮  absent  normal-⋱  absent     subscript  A    n  1    absent  absent   subscript  A    n  n        \rho=\begin{pmatrix}A_{11}&A_{12}&\dots&A_{1n}\\
 A_{21}&A_{22}&&\\
 \vdots&&\ddots&\\
 A_{n1}&&&A_{nn}\end{pmatrix}     Where    n  =   dim   ℋ  A        n   dimension   subscript  ℋ  A      n=\dim\mathcal{H}_{A}   , and each block is a square matrix of dimension    m  =   dim   ℋ  B        m   dimension   subscript  ℋ  B      m=\dim\mathcal{H}_{B}   . Then the partial transpose is       ρ   T  B    =   (      A  11  T      A  12  T     …     A   1  n   T        A  21  T      A  22  T             ⋮       ⋱          A   n  1   T            A   n  n   T      )        superscript  ρ   subscript  T  B       superscript   subscript  A  11   T    superscript   subscript  A  12   T   normal-…   superscript   subscript  A    1  n    T      superscript   subscript  A  21   T    superscript   subscript  A  22   T   absent  absent    normal-⋮  absent  normal-⋱  absent     superscript   subscript  A    n  1    T   absent  absent   superscript   subscript  A    n  n    T       \rho^{T_{B}}=\begin{pmatrix}A_{11}^{T}&A_{12}^{T}&\dots&A_{1n}^{T}\\
 A_{21}^{T}&A_{22}^{T}&&\\
 \vdots&&\ddots&\\
 A_{n1}^{T}&&&A_{nn}^{T}\end{pmatrix}     The criterion states that if    ρ    ρ   \rho\;\!   is separable,    ρ   T  B      superscript  ρ   subscript  T  B     \rho^{T_{B}}   has non-negative eigenvalues . In other words, if    ρ   T  B      superscript  ρ   subscript  T  B     \rho^{T_{B}}   has a negative eigenvalue,    ρ    ρ   \rho\;\!   is guaranteed to be entangled . If the eigenvalues are non-negative, and the dimension is larger than 6, the test is inconclusive.  The result is independent of the party that was transposed, because     ρ   T  A    =    (   ρ   T  B    )   T        superscript  ρ   subscript  T  A     superscript   superscript  ρ   subscript  T  B    T     \rho^{T_{A}}=(\rho^{T_{B}})^{T}   .  Example  Consider this 2-qubit family of Werner states :      ρ  =    p   |   Ψ  -   ⟩    ⟨   Ψ  -   |    +    (   1  -  p   )    I  4         ρ      p   ket   superscript  normal-Ψ      bra   superscript  normal-Ψ          1  p     I  4       \rho=p|\Psi^{-}\rangle\langle\Psi^{-}|+(1-p)\frac{I}{4}     It can be regarded as the convex combination of    |   Ψ  -   ⟩     ket   superscript  normal-Ψ      |\Psi^{-}\rangle   , a maximally entangled state , and identity, the maximally mixed state .  Its density matrix is      ρ  =    1  4    (      1  -  p     0    0    0      0     p  +  1      -   2  p      0      0     -   2  p       p  +  1     0      0    0    0     1  -  p      )        ρ      1  4       1  p   0  0  0    0    p  1       2  p    0    0      2  p      p  1   0    0  0  0    1  p        \rho=\frac{1}{4}\begin{pmatrix}1-p&0&0&0\\
 0&p+1&-2p&0\\
 0&-2p&p+1&0\\
 0&0&0&1-p\end{pmatrix}     and the partial transpose       ρ   T  B    =    1  4    (      1  -  p     0    0     -   2  p        0     p  +  1     0    0      0    0     p  +  1     0       -   2  p      0    0     1  -  p      )         superscript  ρ   subscript  T  B        1  4       1  p   0  0      2  p      0    p  1   0  0    0  0    p  1   0        2  p    0  0    1  p        \rho^{T_{B}}=\frac{1}{4}\begin{pmatrix}1-p&0&0&-2p\\
 0&p+1&0&0\\
 0&0&p+1&0\\
 -2p&0&0&1-p\end{pmatrix}     Its least eigenvalue is     (   1  -   3  p    )   /  4        1    3  p    4    (1-3p)/4   . Therefore, the state is entangled for    p  >   1  /  3       p    1  3     p>1/3   .  Demonstration  If ρ is separable, it can be written as      ρ  =   ∑     p  i    ρ  i  A    ⊗   ρ  i  B         ρ     tensor-product     subscript  p  i    subscript   superscript  ρ  A   i     subscript   superscript  ρ  B   i       \rho=\sum p_{i}\rho^{A}_{i}\otimes\rho^{B}_{i}     In this case, the effect of the partial transposition is trivial:       ρ   T  B    =    I  ⊗  T    (  ρ  )    =   ∑     p  i    ρ  i  A    ⊗    (   ρ  i  B   )   T            superscript  ρ   subscript  T  B       tensor-product  I  T   ρ           tensor-product     subscript  p  i    subscript   superscript  ρ  A   i     superscript   subscript   superscript  ρ  B   i   T        \rho^{T_{B}}=I\otimes T(\rho)=\sum p_{i}\rho^{A}_{i}\otimes(\rho^{B}_{i})^{T}     As the transposition map preserves eigenvalues, the spectrum of    ρ   T  B      superscript  ρ   subscript  T  B     \rho^{T_{B}}   is the same as the spectrum of    ρ    ρ   \rho\;\!   , and in particular    ρ   T  B      superscript  ρ   subscript  T  B     \rho^{T_{B}}   must still be positive semidefinite. This proves the necessity of the PPT criterion.  Showing that being PPT is also sufficient for the 2 X 2 and 3 X 2 (equivalently 2 X 3) cases is more involved. It was shown by the Horodeckis that for every entangled state there exists an entanglement witness . This is a result of geometric nature and invokes the Hahn–Banach theorem (see reference below).  From the existence of entanglement witnesses, one can show that     I  ⊗  Λ    (  ρ  )        tensor-product  I  normal-Λ   ρ    I\otimes\Lambda(\rho)   being positive for all positive maps Λ is a necessary and sufficient condition for the separability of ρ, where Λ maps    B   (   ℋ  B   )       B   subscript  ℋ  B     B(\mathcal{H}_{B})   to    B   (   ℋ  A   )       B   subscript  ℋ  A     B(\mathcal{H}_{A})     Furthermore, every positive map from    B   (   ℋ  B   )       B   subscript  ℋ  B     B(\mathcal{H}_{B})   to    B   (   ℋ  A   )       B   subscript  ℋ  A     B(\mathcal{H}_{A})   can be decomposed into a sum of completely positive and completely copositive maps, when     dim   (   ℋ  B   )    =  2        dim   subscript  ℋ  B    2    \textrm{dim}(\mathcal{H}_{B})=2   and     dim   (   ℋ  A   )    =    2   or  3         dim   subscript  ℋ  A      2  or  3     \textrm{dim}(\mathcal{H}_{A})=2\;\textrm{or}\;3   . In other words, every such map Λ can be written as       Λ  =    Λ  1   +    Λ  2   ∘  T     ,      normal-Λ     subscript  normal-Λ  1      subscript  normal-Λ  2   T      \Lambda=\Lambda_{1}+\Lambda_{2}\circ T,     where    Λ  1     subscript  normal-Λ  1    \Lambda_{1}   and    Λ  2     subscript  normal-Λ  2    \Lambda_{2}   are completely positive and T is the transposition map. This follows from the Størmer-Woronowicz theorem.  Loosely speaking, the transposition map is therefore the only one that can generate negative eigenvalues in these dimensions. So if    ρ   T  B      superscript  ρ   subscript  T  B     \rho^{T_{B}}   is positive,     I  ⊗  Λ    (  ρ  )        tensor-product  I  normal-Λ   ρ    I\otimes\Lambda(\rho)   is positive for any Λ. Thus we conclude that the Peres–Horodecki criterion is also sufficient for separability when     dim   (    ℋ  A   ⊗   ℋ  B    )    ≤  6        dim   tensor-product   subscript  ℋ  A    subscript  ℋ  B     6    \textrm{dim}(\mathcal{H}_{A}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{B})\leq 6   .  In higher dimensions, however, there exist maps that can't be decomposed in this fashion, and the criterion is no longer sufficient. Consequently, there are entangled states which have a positive partial transpose. Such states have the interesting property that they are bound entangled , i.e. they can not be distilled for quantum communication purposes.  Continuous variable systems  The Peres–Horodecki criterion has been extended to continuous variable systems. Simon 1 formulated a particular version of the PPT criterion in terms of the second-order moments of canonical operators and showed that it is necessary and sufficient for    1  ⊕  1     direct-sum  1  1    1\oplus 1   -mode Gaussian states (see Ref. 2 for a seemingly different but essentially equivalent approach). It was later found 3 that Simon's condition is also necessary and sufficient for    1  ⊕  n     direct-sum  1  n    1\oplus n   -mode Gaussian states, but no longer sufficient for    2  ⊕  2     direct-sum  2  2    2\oplus 2   -mode Gaussian states. Simon's condition can be generalized by taking into account the higher order moments of canonical operators 4 or by using entropic measures. 5  References   Asher Peres , Separability Criterion for Density Matrices , Phys.
