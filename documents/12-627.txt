Minimum polynomial extrapolation

In mathematics, minimum polynomial extrapolation is a sequence transformation used for convergence acceleration of vector sequences, due to Sabay and Jackson.1
While Aitken's method is the most famous, it often fails for vector sequences. An effective method for vector sequences is the minimum polynomial extrapolation. It is usually phrased in terms of the fixed point iteration:



Given iterates 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , one constructs the 
 
 
 
  matrix 
 
 
 
  whose columns are the 
 
 
 
  differences. Then, one computes the vector 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes the Mooreâ€“Penrose pseudoinverse of 
 
 
 
 . The number 1 is then appended to the end of 
 
 
 
 , and the extrapolated limit is



where 
 
 
 
  is the matrix whose columns are the 
 
 
 
  iterates starting at 2.
The following 4 line MATLAB code segment implements the MPE algorithm:
U=x(:,2:end-1)-x(:,1:end-2);
 c=-pinv(U)*(x(:,end)-x(:,end-1));
 c(end+1,1)=1;
 s=(x(:,2:end)*c)/sum(c);
