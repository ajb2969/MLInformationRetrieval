   Banach–Mazur compactum      Banach–Mazur compactum   In the mathematical study of functional analysis , the Banach–Mazur distance is a way to define a distance on the set Q ( n ) of n -dimensional normed spaces . If X and Y are two finite-dimensional normed spaces with the same dimension, let GL( X , Y ) denote the collection of all linear isomorphisms T : X → Y . The Banach–Mazur distance between X and Y is defined by        δ   (  X  ,  Y  )    =   log   (   inf   {    ∥  T  ∥    ∥   T   -  1    ∥    :   T  ∈   GL   (  X  ,  Y  )     }    )     .        δ   X  Y       infimum   conditional-set     norm  T    norm   superscript  T    1        T   GL  X  Y         \delta(X,Y)=\log\Bigl(\inf\{\|T\|\|T^{-1}\|:T\in\operatorname{GL}(X,Y)\}\Bigr).     Equipped with the metric δ , the space Q ( n ) is a compact metric space , called the Banach–Mazur compactum .  Many authors prefer to work with the multiplicative Banach–Mazur distance        d   (  X  ,  Y  )    :=   e   δ   (  X  ,  Y  )     =   inf   {    ∥  T  ∥    ∥   T   -  1    ∥    :   T  ∈   GL   (  X  ,  Y  )     }     ,       assign    d   X  Y     superscript  normal-e    δ   X  Y           infimum   conditional-set     norm  T    norm   superscript  T    1        T   GL  X  Y         d(X,Y):=\mathrm{e}^{\delta(X,Y)}=\inf\{\|T\|\|T^{-1}\|:T\in\operatorname{GL}(X%
 ,Y)\},   for which d ( X , Z ) ≤ d ( X , Y ) d ( Y , Z ) and d ( X , X ) = 1. F. John's theorem on the maximal ellipsoid contained in a convex body gives the estimate:        d   (  X  ,   ℓ  2  n   )    ≤   n    ,        d   X   subscript   superscript  normal-ℓ  n   2       n     d(X,\ell^{n}_{2})\leq\sqrt{n},\,    1 where ℓ n 2 denotes R n with the Euclidean norm (see the article on L p spaces ). From this it follows that d ( X , Y ) ≤ n for every couple ( X , Y ) in Q ( n ). However, for the classical spaces, this upper bound for the diameter of Q ( n ) is far from being approached. For example, the distance between ℓ n 1 and ℓ n ∞ is (only) of order n 1/2 (up to a multiplicative constant independent from the dimension n ).  A major achievement in the direction of estimating the diameter of Q ( n ) is due to E. Gluskin, who proved in 1981 that the (multiplicative) diameter of the Banach–Mazur compactum is bounded below by c  n , for some universal c > 0.  Gluskin's method introduces a class of random symmetric polytopes P ( ω ) in R n , and the normed spaces X ( ω ) having P ( ω ) as unit ball (the vector space is R n and the norm is the gauge of P ( ω )). The proof consists in showing that the required estimate is true with large probability for two independent copies of the normed space X ( ω ).  Q (2) is an absolute extensor . 2 On the other hand, Q (2) is not homeomorphic to a Hilbert cube .
