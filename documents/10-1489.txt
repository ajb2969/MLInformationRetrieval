   Hydroxylamine reductase (NADH)      Hydroxylamine reductase (NADH)   In enzymology , a hydroxylamine reductase (NADH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   NH 3 + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   hydroxylamine + NADH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are NH 3 , NAD + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are hydroxylamine , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ammonium:NAD+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include hydroxylamine reductase , ammonium dehydrogenase , NADH-hydroxylamine reductase , N-hydroxy amine reductase , hydroxylamine reductase (NADH2) , and NADH2:hydroxylamine oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in nitrogen metabolism .  References       "  Category:EC 1.7.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
