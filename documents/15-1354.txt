   TRNA (guanine6-N2)-methyltransferase      TRNA (guanine6-N2)-methyltransferase   TRNA (guanine 6 -N 2 )-methyltransferase (, methyltransferase Trm14 , m2G6 methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanine 6 -N 2 )-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine 6 in tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 2 -methylguanine 6 in tRNA   The enzyme specifically methylates guanine 6 at N 2 in tRNA.
