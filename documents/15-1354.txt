TRNA (guanine6-N2)-methyltransferase

TRNA (guanine6-N2)-methyltransferase (, methyltransferase Trm14, m2G6 methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanine6-N2)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine6 in tRNA 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N2-methylguanine6 in tRNA
 

The enzyme specifically methylates guanine6 at N2 in tRNA.
