   Wagner VI projection      Wagner VI projection    Wagner VI is a pseudocylindrical whole Earth map projection . Like the Robinson projection , it is a compromise projection, not having any special attributes other than a pleasing, low distortion appearance. Wagner VI is equivalent to the Kavrayskiy VII horizontally elongated by a factor of    2  /   3       2    3     {2}/\sqrt{3}   . This elongation results in proper preservation of shapes near the equator but slightly more distortion overall. The aspect ratio of this projection is 2:1, which is equal to that of the Equirectangular projection .  The Wagner VI is defined by: 1      x  =   λ    1  -   3    (   ϕ  π   )   2           x    λ      1    3   superscript    ϕ  π   2         x=\lambda\sqrt{1-3\left(\frac{\phi}{\pi}\right)^{2}}         y  =   ϕ       y  ϕ    y=\phi\,   .
