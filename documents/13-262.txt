   Partially ordered ring      Partially ordered ring   In abstract algebra , a partially ordered ring is a ring ( A , +, ¬∑ ), together with a compatible partial order , i.e. a partial order    ‚â§     \leq   on the underlying set A that is compatible with the ring operations in the sense that it satisfies:      x  ‚â§  y      x  y    x\leq y   implies     x  +  z   ‚â§   y  +  z         x  z     y  z     x+z\leq y+z   and      0  ‚â§  x      0  x    0\leq x   and    0  ‚â§  y      0  y    0\leq y   imply that    0  ‚â§   x  ‚ãÖ  y       0   normal-‚ãÖ  x  y     0\leq x\cdot y   for all     x  ,  y  ,  z   ‚àà  A       x  y  z   A    x,y,z\in A   . 1 Various extensions of this definition exist that constrain the ring, the partial order, or both. For example, an Archimedean partially ordered ring is a partially ordered ring    (  A  ,  ‚â§  )     A     (A,\leq)   where   A   A   A   's partially ordered additive group is Archimedean . 2  An ordered ring , also called a totally ordered ring , is a partially ordered ring    (  A  ,  ‚â§  )     A     (A,\leq)   where   ‚â§     \leq   is additionally a total order . 3 4  An l-ring , or lattice-ordered ring , is a partially ordered ring    (  A  ,  ‚â§  )     A     (A,\leq)   where   ‚â§     \leq   is additionally a lattice order .  Properties  The additive group of a partially ordered ring is always a partially ordered group .  The set of non-negative elements of a partially ordered ring (the set of elements x for which    0  ‚â§  x      0  x    0\leq x   , also called the positive cone of the ring) is closed under addition and multiplication, i.e., if P is the set of non-negative elements of a partially ordered ring, then     P  +  P   ‚äÜ  P        P  P   P    P+P\subseteq P   , and     P  ‚ãÖ  P   ‚äÜ  P       normal-‚ãÖ  P  P   P    P\cdot P\subseteq P   . Furthermore,     P  ‚à©   (   -  P   )    =   {  0  }         P    P     0     P\cap(-P)=\{0\}   .  The mapping of the compatible partial order on a ring A to the set of its non-negative elements is one-to-one ; 5 that is, the compatible partial order uniquely determines the set of non-negative elements, and a set of elements uniquely determines the compatible partial order if one exists.  If S is a subset of a ring A , and:       0  ‚àà  S      0  S    0\in S          S  ‚à©   (   -  S   )    =   {  0  }         S    S     0     S\cap(-S)=\{0\}          S  +  S   ‚äÜ  S        S  S   S    S+S\subseteq S          S  ‚ãÖ  S   ‚äÜ  S       normal-‚ãÖ  S  S   S    S\cdot S\subseteq S      then the relation   ‚â§     \leq   where    x  ‚â§  y      x  y    x\leq y    iff      y  -  x   ‚àà  S        y  x   S    y-x\in S   defines a compatible partial order on A ( ie.     (  A  ,  ‚â§  )     A     (A,\leq)   is a partially ordered ring). 6  In any l-ring, the absolute value     |  x  |      x    |x|   of an element x can be defined to be    x  ‚à®   (   -  x   )       x    x     x\vee(-x)   , where    x  ‚à®  y      x  y    x\vee y   denotes the maximal element . For any x and y ,       |   x  ‚ãÖ  y   |   ‚â§    |  x  |   ‚ãÖ   |  y  |           normal-‚ãÖ  x  y     normal-‚ãÖ    x     y      |x\cdot y|\leq|x|\cdot|y|   holds. 7  f-rings  An f-ring , or Pierce‚ÄìBirkhoff ring , is a lattice-ordered ring    (  A  ,  ‚â§  )     A     (A,\leq)   in which     x  ‚àß  y   =  0        x  y   0    x\wedge y=0    8 and    0  ‚â§  z      0  z    0\leq z   imply that      z  x   ‚àß  y   =    x  z   ‚àß  y   =  0            z  x   y       x  z   y        0     zx\wedge y=xz\wedge y=0   for all     x  ,  y  ,  z   ‚àà  A       x  y  z   A    x,y,z\in A   . They were first introduced by Garrett Birkhoff and Richard S. Pierce in 1956, in a paper titled "Lattice-ordered rings", in an attempt to restrict the class of l-rings so as to eliminate a number of pathological examples. For example, Birkhoff and Pierce demonstrated an l-ring with 1 in which 1 is negative, even though being a square. 9 The additional hypothesis required of f-rings eliminates this possibility.  Example  Let X be a Hausdorff space , and    ùíû   (  X  )       ùíû  X    \mathcal{C}(X)   be the space of all continuous , real -valued functions on X .    ùíû   (  X  )       ùíû  X    \mathcal{C}(X)   is an Archimedean f-ring with 1 under the following point-wise operations:        [   f  +  g   ]    (  x  )    =    f   (  x  )    +   g   (  x  )            delimited-[]    f  g    x       f  x     g  x      [f+g](x)=f(x)+g(x)           [   f  g   ]    (  x  )    =     f   (  x  )    ‚ãÖ  g    (  x  )           delimited-[]    f  g    x      normal-‚ãÖ    f  x   g   x     [fg](x)=f(x)\cdot g(x)            [   f  ‚àß  g   ]    (  x  )    =    f   (  x  )    ‚àß   g   (  x  )      .         delimited-[]    f  g    x       f  x     g  x      [f\wedge g](x)=f(x)\wedge g(x).    10  From an algebraic point of view the rings    ùíû   (  X  )       ùíû  X    \mathcal{C}(X)   are fairly rigid. For example localisations, residue rings or limits of rings of the form    ùíû   (  X  )       ùíû  X    \mathcal{C}(X)   are not of this form in general. A much more flexible class of f-rings containing all rings of continuous functions and resembling many of the properties of these rings, is the class of real closed rings .  Properties  A direct product of f-rings is an f-ring, an l-subring of an f-ring is an f-ring, and an l-homomorphic image of an f-ring is an f-ring. 11      |   x  y   |   =    |  x  |    |  y  |            x  y        x     y      |xy|=|x||y|   in an f-ring. 12  The category  Arf consists of the Archimedean f-rings with 1 and the l-homomorphisms that preserve the identity. 13  Every ordered ring is an f-ring, so every subdirect union of ordered rings is also an f-ring. Assuming the axiom of choice , a theorem of Birkhoff shows the converse, and that an l-ring is an f-ring if and only if it is l-isomorphic to a subdirect union of ordered rings. 14 Some mathematicians take this to be the definition of an f-ring. 15  Formally verified results for commutative ordered rings  IsarMathLib , a library for the Isabelle theorem prover , has formal verifications of a few fundamental results on commutative ordered rings. The results are proved in the ring1 context. 16  Suppose    (  A  ,  ‚â§  )     A     (A,\leq)   is a commutative ordered ring, and     x  ,  y  ,  z   ‚àà  A       x  y  z   A    x,y,z\in A   . Then:       by       The additive group of A is an ordered group   OrdRing_ZF_1_L4         x  ‚â§  y      x  y    x\leq y   iff     x  -  y   ‚â§  0        x  y   0    x-y\leq 0      OrdRing_ZF_1_L7         x  ‚â§  y      x  y    x\leq y   and    0  ‚â§  z      0  z    0\leq z   imply      x  z   ‚â§   y  z         x  z     y  z     xz\leq yz   and     z  x   ‚â§   z  y         z  x     z  y     zx\leq zy      OrdRing_ZF_1_L9         0  ‚â§  1      0  1    0\leq 1      ordring_one_is_nonneg          |   x  y   |   =    |  x  |    |  y  |            x  y        x     y      |xy|=|x||y|      OrdRing_ZF_2_L5          |   x  +  y   |   ‚â§    |  x  |   +   |  y  |            x  y        x     y      |x+y|\leq|x|+|y|      ord_ring_triangle_ineq     x is either in the positive set, equal to 0, or in minus the positive set.   OrdRing_ZF_3_L2     The set of positive elements of    (  A  ,  ‚â§  )     A     (A,\leq)   is closed under multiplication iff A has no zero divisors .   OrdRing_ZF_3_L3     If A is non-trivial (    0  ‚â†  1      0  1    0\neq 1   ), then it is infinite.   ord_ring_infinite     References    Further reading    Gillman, Leonard; Jerison, Meyer Rings of continuous functions.
