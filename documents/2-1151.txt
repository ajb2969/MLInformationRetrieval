   Standard score      Standard score   (Figure)  Compares the various grading methods in a normal distribution. Includes: Standard deviations, cumulative percentages, percentile equivalents, Z-scores, T-scores , standard nine, percent in stanine   In statistics , the standard score is the (signed) number of standard deviations an observation or datum is above the mean . Thus, a positive standard score indicates a datum above the mean, while a negative standard score indicates a datum below the mean. It is a dimensionless quantity obtained by subtracting the population mean from an individual raw score and then dividing the difference by the population  standard deviation . This conversion process is called standardizing or normalizing (however, "normalizing" can refer to many types of ratios; see normalization (statistics) for more).  Standard scores are also called z-values, z -scores, normal scores, and standardized variables; the use of "Z" is because the normal distribution is also known as the "Z distribution". They are most frequently used to compare a sample to a standard normal deviate , though they can be defined without assumptions of normality.  The z-score is only defined if one knows the population parameters; if one only has a sample set, then the analogous computation with sample mean and sample standard deviation yields the Student's t-statistic .  Calculation from raw score  The standard score of a raw score x  1 is      z  =    x  -  μ   σ       z      x  μ   σ     z={x-\mu\over\sigma}     where:   μ is the mean of the population;  σ is the standard deviation of the population.   The absolute value of z represents the distance between the raw score and the population mean in units of the standard deviation. z is negative when the raw score is below the mean, positive when above.  A key point is that calculating z requires the population mean and the population standard deviation, not the sample mean or sample deviation. It requires knowing the population parameters, not the statistics of a sample drawn from the population of interest. But knowing the true standard deviation of a population is often unrealistic except in cases such as standardized testing , where the entire population is measured. In cases where it is impossible to measure every member of a population, the standard deviation may be estimated using a random sample.  It measures the sigma distance of actual data from the average.  The Z value provides an assessment of how off-target a process is operating.  Applications  The z-score is often used in the z-test in standardized testing – the analog of the Student's t-test for a population whose parameters are known, rather than estimated. As it is very unusual to know the entire population, the t-test is much more widely used.  Also, standard score can be used in the calculation of prediction intervals . A prediction interval [ L , U ], consisting of a lower endpoint designated L and an upper endpoint designated U , is an interval such that a future observation X will lie in the interval with high probability   γ   γ   \gamma   , i.e.      P   (  -  z  <  Z  <  z  )   =  γ     fragments  P   fragments  normal-(   z   Z   z  normal-)    γ    P\left(-z   By determining the quantile z such that       L  =   μ  -   z  σ     ,   U  =   μ  +   z  σ        formulae-sequence    L    μ    z  σ       U    μ    z  σ       L=\mu-z\sigma,\ U=\mu+z\sigma   it follows:      E   [  X  ]      normal-E  X    \operatorname{E}[X]     Standardizing in mathematical statistics  In mathematical statistics , a random variable  X is standardized by subtracting its expected value       σ   (  X  )    =    Var   (  X  )      :      normal-:      σ  X      Var  X     absent    \sigma(X)=\sqrt{\operatorname{Var}(X)}:   and dividing the difference by its standard deviation     Z  =    X  -   E   [  X  ]      σ   (  X  )         Z      X   normal-E  X      σ  X      Z={X-\operatorname{E}[X]\over\sigma(X)}           X   1   ,  …  ,   X  n       subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  n     \ X_{1},\dots,X_{n}     If the random variable under consideration is the sample mean of a random sample     X  ¯   =    1  n     ∑   i  =  1   n    X  i          normal-¯  X       1  n     superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  X  i       \bar{X}={1\over n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}   of X :       Z  =     X  ¯   -   E   [  X  ]       σ   (  X  )    /   n      .
