   Potato paradox      Potato paradox     The potato paradox is a mathematical calculation that has a counter-intuitive result. The "paradox" involves dehydrating potatoes by a seemingly minuscule amount, and then calculating a change in mass which is larger than expected.  Description  The paradox has been described as:  You have 100 lbs of Martian potatoes, which are 99 percent water by weight. You let them dehydrate until they're 98 percent water. How much do they weigh now?  The Universal Book of Mathematics states the problem as follows:   In Quine's classification of paradoxes , the potato paradox is a veridical paradox.  Explanation  One explanation begins by saying that initially the non-water weight is 1 pound, which is 1% of 100 pounds. Then one asks: 1 pound is 2% of how many pounds? In order for that percentage to be twice as big, the total weight must be half as big.  Simple  100 lbs of potatoes, 99% water (by weight), means that there's 99 lbs of water, and 1 lb of solids. It's a 1:99 ratio.  If the water decreases to 98%, then the solids account for 2% of the weight. The 2:98 ratio reduces to 1:49. Since the solids still weigh 1 lb, the water must weigh 49 lbs.  Algebraic  An explanation via algebra is as follows:  The weight of water in the fresh potatoes is    0.99  ⋅  100     normal-⋅  0.99  100    0.99\cdot 100   .  If   x   x   x   is the weight of water lost from the potatoes when they dehydrate then    0.98   (   100  -  x   )       0.98    100  x     0.98(100-x)   is the weight of water in the dehydrated potatoes. Therefore:        0.99  ⋅  100   -   0.98   (   100  -  x   )     =  x         normal-⋅  0.99  100     0.98    100  x     x    0.99\cdot 100-0.98(100-x)=x     Expanding brackets and simplifying       99  -   (   98  -   0.98  x    )    =  x        99    98    0.98  x     x    99-(98-0.98x)=x           99  -  98   +   0.98  x    =  x          99  98     0.98  x    x    99-98+0.98x=x          1  +   0.98  x    =  x        1    0.98  x    x    1+0.98x=x     Subtracting the smaller   x   x   x   term from each side        1  +   0.98  x    -   0.98  x    =   x  -   0.98  x            1    0.98  x      0.98  x      x    0.98  x      1+0.98x-0.98x=x-0.98x         1  =   0.02  x       1    0.02  x     1=0.02x     And solving:       1  /  0.02   =    0.02  x   /  0.02         1  0.02       0.02  x   0.02     1/0.02=0.02x/0.02     Which gives the lost water as:      50  =  x      50  x    50=x     And the dehydrated weight of the potatoes as:       100  -  x   =   100  -  50   =  50          100  x     100  50        50     100-x=100-50=50     See also   List of paradoxes   References  External links     "  Category:Mathematics paradoxes  Category:Potatoes
