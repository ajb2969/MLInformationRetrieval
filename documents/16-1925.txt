Glaeser's continuity theorem
 <
 hr>In mathematical analysis, Glaeser's continuity theorem, is a characterization of the continuity of the derivative of the square roots of functions of class 
 
 
 
 . It was introduced in 1963 by Georges Glaeser,1 and was later simplified by Jean Dieudonné.2
The theorem states: Let 
 
 
 
  be a function of class 
 
 
 
  in an open set U contained in 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is of class 
 
 
 
  in U if and only if its partial derivatives of first and second order vanish in the zeros of f.
