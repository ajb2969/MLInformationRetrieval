   UDP-arabinose 4-epimerase      UDP-arabinose 4-epimerase   In enzymology , an UDP-arabinose 4-epimerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-L-arabinose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP-D-xylose   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , UDP-L-arabinose , and one product , UDP-D-xylose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on carbohydrates and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-L-arabinose 4-epimerase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoarabinose epimerase , UDP arabinose epimerase , uridine 5'-diphosphate-D-xylose 4-epimerase , and UDP-D-xylose 4-epimerase . This enzyme participates in nucleotide sugars metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 5.1.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
