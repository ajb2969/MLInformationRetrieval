   Fermat curve      Fermat curve   In mathematics , the Fermat curve is the algebraic curve in the complex projective plane defined in homogeneous coordinates ( X : Y : Z ) by the Fermat equation         X  n   +   Y  n    =   Z  n    .         superscript  X  n    superscript  Y  n     superscript  Z  n     X^{n}+Y^{n}=Z^{n}.     Therefore in terms of the affine plane its equation is        x  n   +   y  n    =  1.         superscript  x  n    superscript  y  n    1.    x^{n}+y^{n}=1.     An integer solution to the Fermat equation would correspond to a nonzero rational number solution to the affine equation, and vice versa. But by Fermat's last theorem it is now known that (for n ≥ 3) there are no nontrivial integer solutions to the Fermat equation; therefore, the Fermat curve has no nontrivial rational points.  The Fermat curve is non-singular and has genus        (   n  -  1   )    (   n  -  2   )    /  2.          n  1     n  2    2.    (n-1)(n-2)/2.     This means genus 0 for the case n = 2 (a conic ) and genus 1 only for n = 3 (an elliptic curve ). The Jacobian variety of the Fermat curve has been studied in depth. It is isogenous to a product of simple abelian varieties with complex multiplication .  The Fermat curve also has gonality      n  -  1.      n  1.    n-1.
