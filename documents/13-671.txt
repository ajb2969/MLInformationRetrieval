Axis: x=red, y=yellow, z=blue   In algebraic geometry , a Ch창telet surface is a rational surface studied by  given by an equation         y  2   -   a   z  2     =   P   (  x  )     ,         superscript  y  2     a   superscript  z  2       P  x     y^{2}-az^{2}=P(x),\,     where P has degree 3 or 4. They are conic bundles .  References      "  Category:Algebraic surfaces  Category:Complex surfaces
