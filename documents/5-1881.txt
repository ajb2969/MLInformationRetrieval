   Littlewood–Offord problem      Littlewood–Offord problem   In mathematics , the Littlewood–Offord problem is the combinatorial question in geometry of bounding from above the number of subsums made out of vectors        v  1   ,   v  2   ,  ⋯  ,   v  n    ∈   ℝ  d         subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2   normal-⋯   subscript  v  n     superscript  ℝ  d     v_{1},v_{2},\cdots,v_{n}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}   that fall into a fixed convex set    A  ⊂   ℝ  d       A   superscript  ℝ  d     A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}   .  The first result (for d =1, 2) was given in a paper from 1938 1 by John Edensor Littlewood and A. Cyril Offord , on random polynomials . This Littlewood–Offord lemma states that, for real or complex numbers v i of absolute value at least one and any disc of radius one, not more than     (    c    log   n  /   n      )    2  n         c      n    n       superscript  2  n     \Big(c\,\log n/\sqrt{n}\Big)\,2^{n}   of the 2 n sums of v i fall into the disc.  In 1945 Paul Erdős improved the upper bound for d =1 to       (     n       ⌊   n  /  2   ⌋      )   ≈     2  n     1   n          binomial  n      n  2        superscript  2  n     1    n       {n\choose\lfloor{n/2}\rfloor}\approx 2^{n}\,\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}   using Sperner's theorem . This bound is sharp; equality is attained when all v _i are equal.  Then Kleitman in 1966 showed that the same bound held for complex numbers. He extended this (1970) to v i in a normed space . See 2 for the proofs of these results.  The semi-sum   m = ½Σ v i    can be subtracted from all the subsums. That is, by change of origin and then scaling by a factor of 2, we may as well consider sums   Σ ε i v i    in which ε i takes the value 1 or −1. This makes the problem into a probabilistic one, in which the question is of the distribution of these random vectors , and what can be said knowing nothing more about the v i .
