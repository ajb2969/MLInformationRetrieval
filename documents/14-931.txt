Cross-spectrum

In time series analysis, the cross-spectrum is used as part of a frequency domain analysis of the cross-correlation or cross-covariance between two time series.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  represent a pair of stochastic processes that are jointly wide sense stationary with autocovariance functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and cross-covariance function 
 
 
 
 . Then the cross-spectrum

 
  is defined as the Fourier transform of 
 
 
1


 
  where


 
  .
The cross-spectrum has representations as a decomposition into (i) its real part (co-spectrum) and its imaginary part (quadrature spectrum)



and (ii) in polar coordinates


 
  Here, the amplitude spectrum 
 
 
 
  is given by


 
  and the phase spectrum 
 
 
 
  is given by



Squared coherency spectrum
The squared coherency spectrum is given by



which expresses the amplitude spectrum in dimensionless units.
