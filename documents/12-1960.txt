Restricted Lie algebra

In mathematics, a restricted Lie algebra is a Lie algebra together with an additional "p operation."
Definition
Let L be a Lie algebra over a field k of characteristic p>0. A p operation on L is a map 
 
 
 
  satisfying



 
  for all 
 
 
 
 ,


 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 ,


 
 , for all 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the coefficient of 
 
 
 
 
  in the formal expression 
 
 
 
 .

If the characteristic of k is 0, then L is a restricted Lie algebra where the p operation is the identity map.
Examples
For any associative algebra A defined over a field of characteristic p, the bracket operation 
 
 
 
  and p operation 
 
 
 
  make A into a restricted Lie algebra 
 
 
 
 .
Let G be an algebraic group over a field k of characteristic p, and 
 
 
 
 
  be the Zariski tangent space at the identity element of G. Each element of 
 
 
 
  uniquely defines a left-invariant vector field on G, and the commutator of vector fields defines a Lie algebra structure on 
 
 
 
  just as in the Lie group case. If p>0, the Frobenius map

 
  defines a p operation on 
 
 
 
 .
Restricted universal enveloping algebra
The functor 
 
 
 
 
  has a left adjoint

 
  called the restricted universal enveloping algebra. To construct this, let 
 
 
 
  be the universal enveloping algebra of L forgetting the p operation. Letting I be the two-sided ideal generated by elements of the form 
 
 
 
 , we set 
 
 
 
 . It satsfies a form of the PBW theorem.

Restricted Lie algebras are used in Jacobson's Galois correspondence for purely inseparable extensions of fields of exponent 1.
