Dual topology

In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics a dual topology is a locally convex topology on a dual pair, two vector spaces with a bilinear form defined on them, so that one vector space becomes the continuous dual of the other space.
The different dual topologies for a given dual pair are characterized by the Mackey–Arens theorem. All locally convex topologies with their continuous dual are trivially a dual pair and the locally convex topology is a dual topology.
Several topological properties depend only on the dual pair and not on the chosen dual topology and thus it is often possible to substitute a complicated dual topology by a simpler one.
Definition
Given a dual pair

 
 , a dual topology on 
 
 
 
  is a locally convex topology

 
  so that


 
  Here 
 
 
 
  denotes the continuous dual of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  means that there is a linear isomorphism


 
  (If a locally convex topology 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  is not a dual topology, then either 
 
 
 
  is not surjective or it is ill-defined since the linear functional 
 
 
 
  is not continuous on 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 .)
Properties

Theorem (by Mackey): Given a dual pair, the bounded sets under any dual topology are identical.


Under any dual topology the same sets are barrelled.

Characterization of dual topologies
The Mackey–Arens theorem, named after George Mackey and Richard Arens, characterizes all possible dual topologies on a locally convex space.
The theorem shows that the coarsest dual topology is the weak topology, the topology of uniform convergence on all finite subsets of 
 
 
 
 , and the finest topology is the Mackey topology, the topology of uniform convergence on all absolutely convex weakly compact subsets of 
 
 
 
 .
Mackey–Arens theorem
Given a dual pair

 
  with 
 
 
 
  a locally convex space and 
 
 
 
  its continuous dual, then 
 
 
 
  is a dual topology on 
 
 
if and only if it is a topology of uniform convergence on a family of absolutely convex and weakly compact subsets of
