   Dual topology      Dual topology   In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics a dual topology is a locally convex topology on a dual pair , two vector spaces with a bilinear form defined on them, so that one vector space becomes the continuous dual of the other space.  The different dual topologies for a given dual pair are characterized by the Mackey–Arens theorem. All locally convex topologies with their continuous dual are trivially a dual pair and the locally convex topology is a dual topology.  Several topological properties depend only on the dual pair and not on the chosen dual topology and thus it is often possible to substitute a complicated dual topology by a simpler one.  Definition  Given a dual pair     (  X  ,  Y  ,   ⟨  ,  ⟩   )     fragments  normal-(  X  normal-,  Y  normal-,   fragments  normal-⟨  normal-,  normal-⟩   normal-)    (X,Y,\langle,\rangle)   , a dual topology on   X   X   X   is a locally convex topology    τ   τ   \tau   so that         (  X  ,  τ  )   ′   ≃  Y   .     similar-to-or-equals   superscript   X  τ   normal-′   Y    (X,\tau)^{\prime}\simeq Y.   Here     (  X  ,  τ  )   ′     superscript   X  τ   normal-′    (X,\tau)^{\prime}   denotes the continuous dual of    (  X  ,  τ  )     X  τ    (X,\tau)   and      (  X  ,  τ  )   ′   ≃  Y     similar-to-or-equals   superscript   X  τ   normal-′   Y    (X,\tau)^{\prime}\simeq Y   means that there is a linear isomorphism      Ψ  :  Y  →    (  X  ,  τ  )   ′   ,  y  ↦   (  x  ↦   ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩   )   .     fragments  Ψ  normal-:  Y  normal-→   superscript   fragments  normal-(  X  normal-,  τ  normal-)   normal-′   normal-,  y  maps-to   fragments  normal-(  x  maps-to   fragments  normal-⟨  x  normal-,  y  normal-⟩   normal-)   normal-.    \Psi:Y\to(X,\tau)^{\prime},\quad y\mapsto(x\mapsto\langle x,y\rangle).   (If a locally convex topology   τ   τ   \tau   on   X   X   X   is not a dual topology, then either   Ψ   normal-Ψ   \Psi   is not surjective or it is ill-defined since the linear functional    x  ↦   ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩      maps-to  x   x  y     x\mapsto\langle x,y\rangle   is not continuous on   X   X   X   for some   y   y   y   .)  Properties   Theorem (by Mackey ): Given a dual pair, the bounded sets under any dual topology are identical.    Under any dual topology the same sets are barrelled .   Characterization of dual topologies  The Mackey–Arens theorem , named after George Mackey and Richard Arens , characterizes all possible dual topologies on a locally convex space .  The theorem shows that the coarsest dual topology is the weak topology , the topology of uniform convergence on all finite subsets of    X  ′     superscript  X  normal-′    X^{\prime}   , and the finest topology is the Mackey topology , the topology of uniform convergence on all absolutely convex weakly compact subsets of    X  ′     superscript  X  normal-′    X^{\prime}   .  Mackey–Arens theorem  Given a dual pair     (  X  ,   X  ′   )     X   superscript  X  normal-′     (X,X^{\prime})   with   X   X   X   a locally convex space and    X  ′     superscript  X  normal-′    X^{\prime}   its continuous dual , then   τ   τ   \tau   is a dual topology on   X   X   X    if and only if it is a topology of uniform convergence on a family of absolutely convex and weakly compact subsets of    X  ′     superscript  X  normal-′    X^{\prime}     References  "  Category:Topology of function spaces
