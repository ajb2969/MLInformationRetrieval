<h1>Electrical resonance</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Electrical resonance</strong> occurs in an <a href="electrical_network" title="wikilink">electric circuit</a> at a particular <em><a href="Resonance" title="wikilink">resonance frequency</a></em> when the imaginary parts of <a href="Electrical_impedance" title="wikilink">impedances</a> or <a href="admittance" title="wikilink">admittances</a> of circuit elements cancel each other. In some circuits this happens when the impedance between the input and output of the circuit is almost zero and the <a href="transfer_function" title="wikilink">transfer function</a> is close to one.</p>

<p>Resonant circuits exhibit ringing and can generate higher voltages and currents than are fed into them. They are widely used in <a class="uri" href="wireless" title="wikilink">wireless</a> (<a class="uri" href="radio" title="wikilink">radio</a>) transmission for both transmission and reception.</p>
<h2 id="lc-circuits">LC circuits</h2>

<p>Resonance of a circuit involving <a class="uri" href="capacitors" title="wikilink">capacitors</a> and <a class="uri" href="inductors" title="wikilink">inductors</a> occurs because the collapsing magnetic field of the inductor generates an electric current in its windings that charges the capacitor, and then the discharging capacitor provides an electric current that builds the magnetic field in the inductor. This process is repeated continually. An analogy is a mechanical <a class="uri" href="pendulum" title="wikilink">pendulum</a>.</p>

<p>At resonance, the series <a href="Electrical_impedance" title="wikilink">impedance</a> of the two elements is at a minimum and the parallel impedance is at maximum. Resonance is used for <a href="tuned_filter" title="wikilink">tuning</a> and filtering, because it occurs at a particular <a class="uri" href="frequency" title="wikilink">frequency</a> for given values of <a class="uri" href="inductance" title="wikilink">inductance</a> and <a class="uri" href="capacitance" title="wikilink">capacitance</a>. It can be detrimental to the operation of <a href="telecommunications" title="wikilink">communications</a> circuits by causing unwanted sustained and transient oscillations that may cause <a class="uri" href="noise" title="wikilink">noise</a>, signal <a class="uri" href="distortion" title="wikilink">distortion</a>, and damage to circuit elements.</p>

<p>Parallel resonance or near-to-resonance circuits can be used to prevent the waste of electrical energy, which would otherwise occur while the inductor built its field or the capacitor charged and discharged. As an example, asynchronous motors waste inductive current while synchronous ones waste capacitive current. The use of the two types in parallel makes the inductor feed the capacitor, and <em>vice versa</em>, maintaining the same resonant current in the circuit, and converting all the current into useful work.</p>

<p>Since the inductive <a href="Electrical_reactance" title="wikilink">reactance</a> and the capacitive reactance are of equal magnitude, ω<em>L</em> = 1/ω<em>C</em>, so:</p>

<p>where ω = 2π<em>f</em>, in which <em>f</em> is the resonance frequency in <a class="uri" href="hertz" title="wikilink">hertz</a>, <em>L</em> is the inductance in <a href="henry_(unit)" title="wikilink">henries</a>, and <em>C</em> is the capacitance in <a href="farad" title="wikilink">farads</a> when standard <a href="SI_unit" title="wikilink">SI units</a> are used.</p>

<p>The quality of the resonance (how long it will ring when excited) is determined by its <a href="Q_factor" title="wikilink">Q factor</a>, which is a function of resistance. A true LC circuit would have infinite Q, but all real circuits have some resistance and smaller Q and are usually approximated more accurately by an RLC circuit.</p>
<h2 id="rlc-circuit">RLC circuit</h2>

<p> An <strong>RLC circuit</strong> (or <strong>LCR circuit</strong>) is an <a href="electrical_circuit" title="wikilink">electrical circuit</a> consisting of a <a class="uri" href="resistor" title="wikilink">resistor</a>, an <a class="uri" href="inductor" title="wikilink">inductor</a>, and a <a class="uri" href="capacitor" title="wikilink">capacitor</a>, connected in series or in parallel. The RLC part of the name is due to those letters being the usual electrical symbols for <a href="electrical_resistance" title="wikilink">resistance</a>, <a class="uri" href="inductance" title="wikilink">inductance</a> and <a class="uri" href="capacitance" title="wikilink">capacitance</a> respectively. The circuit forms a <a href="harmonic_oscillator" title="wikilink">harmonic oscillator</a> for current and <a href="resonance" title="wikilink">resonates</a> similarly to an <a href="LC_circuit" title="wikilink">LC circuit</a>. The main difference stemming from the presence of the resistor is that any oscillation induced in the circuit decays over time if it is not kept going by a source. This effect of the resistor is called <a class="uri" href="damping" title="wikilink">damping</a>. The presence of the resistance also reduces the peak resonant frequency. Some resistance is unavoidable in real circuits, even if a resistor is not specifically included as a component. A pure LC circuit is an ideal that exists only in theory.</p>

<p>There are many applications for this circuit. It is used in many different types of <a href="electronic_oscillator" title="wikilink">oscillator circuits</a>. An important application is for <a href="tuner_(electronics)" title="wikilink">tuning</a>, such as in <a href="receiver_(radio)" title="wikilink">radio receivers</a> or <a href="television_set" title="wikilink">television sets</a>, where they are used to select a narrow range of frequencies from the ambient radio waves. In this role the circuit is often referred to as a tuned circuit. An RLC circuit can be used as a <a href="band-pass_filter" title="wikilink">band-pass filter</a>, <a href="band-stop_filter" title="wikilink">band-stop filter</a>, <a href="low-pass_filter" title="wikilink">low-pass filter</a> or <a href="high-pass_filter" title="wikilink">high-pass filter</a>. The tuning application, for instance, is an example of band-pass filtering. The RLC filter is described as a <em>second-order</em> circuit, meaning that any voltage or current in the circuit can be described by a second-order <a href="differential_equation" title="wikilink">differential equation</a> in circuit analysis.</p>

<p>The three circuit elements can be combined in a number of different <a href="topology_(electronics)" title="wikilink">topologies</a>. All three elements in series or all three elements in parallel are the simplest in concept and the most straightforward to analyse. There are, however, other arrangements, some with practical importance in real circuits. One issue often encountered is the need to take into account inductor resistance. Inductors are typically constructed from coils of wire, the resistance of which is not usually desirable, but it often has a significant effect on the circuit.</p>
