Method of simulation
The solvent is modelled as a set of 
 
 
 
  point particles of mass 
 
 
 
  with continuous coordinates 
 
 
 
  and velocities 
 
 
 
 
 . The simulation consists of streaming and collision steps.
During the streaming step, the coordinates of the particles are updated according to



where 
 
 
 
  is a chosen simulation time step which is typically much larger than a molecular dynamics time step.
After the streaming step, interactions between the solvent particles are modelled in the collision step. The particles are sorted into collision cells with a lateral size 
 
 
 
 . Particle velocities within each cell are updated according to the collision rule



where 
 
 
 
 
  is the centre of mass velocity of the particles in the collision cell and 
 
 
 
  is a rotation matrix. In two dimensions, 
 
 
 
  performs a rotation by an angle 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  with probability 
 
 
 
 
 . In three dimensions, the rotation is performed by an angle 
 
 
 
  around a random rotation axis. The same rotation is applied for all particles within a given collision cell, but the direction (axis) of rotation is statistically independent both between all cells and for a given cell in time.
If the structure of the collision grid defined by the positions of the collision cells is fixed, Galilean invariance is violated. It is restored with the introduction of a random shift of the collision grid.3
Explicit expressions for the diffusion coefficient and viscosity derived based on Green-Kubo relations are in excellent agreement with simulations.45
Simulation parameters
The set of parameters for the simulation of the solvent are:

solvent particle mass 
 
 

average number of solvent particles per collision box 
 
 

lateral collision box size 
 
 

stochastic rotation angle 
 
 

kT (energy)
time step 
 
 


The simulation parameters define the solvent properties,6 such as

mean free path


diffusion coefficient


shear viscosity


thermal diffusivity



where 
 
 
 
  is the dimensionality of the system.
A typical choice for normalisation is 
 
 
 
 . To reproduce fluid-like behaviour, the remaining parameters may be fixed as
