   Abstract Wiener space      Abstract Wiener space   An abstract Wiener space is a mathematical object in measure theory , used to construct a "decent" ( strictly positive and locally finite ) measure on an infinite - dimensional  vector space . It is named after the American  mathematician  Norbert Wiener . Wiener's original construction only applied to the space of real-valued continuous paths on the unit interval , known as classical Wiener space ; Leonard Gross provided the generalization to the case of a general separable  Banach space .  The structure theorem for Gaussian measures states that all Gaussian measures can be represented by the abstract Wiener space construction.  Definition  Let H be a separable Hilbert space . Let E be a separable Banach space. Let i : H → E be an injective  continuous linear map with dense  image (i.e., the closure of i ( H ) in E is E itself) that radonifies the canonical Gaussian cylinder set measure  γ H on H . Then the triple ( i , H , E ) (or simply i : H → E ) is called an abstract Wiener space . The measure γ induced on E is called the abstract Wiener measure of i : H → E .  The Hilbert space H is sometimes called the Cameron–Martin space or reproducing kernel Hilbert space .  Some sources (e.g. Bell (2006)) consider H to be a densely embedded Hilbert subspace of the Banach space E , with i simply the inclusion of H into E . There is no loss of generality in taking this "embedded spaces" viewpoint instead of the "different spaces" viewpoint given above.  Properties   γ is a Borel measure : it is defined on the Borel σ-algebra generated by the open subsets of E .  γ is a Gaussian measure in the sense that f ∗ ( γ ) is a Gaussian measure on R for every linear functional  f ∈ E ∗ , f ≠ 0.  Hence, γ is strictly positive and locally finite.  If E is a finite-dimensional Banach space, we may take E to be isomorphic to R n for some n ∈ N . Setting H = R n and i : H → E to be the canonical isomorphism gives the abstract Wiener measure γ = γ n , the standard Gaussian measure on R n .  The behaviour of γ under translation is described by the Cameron–Martin theorem .  Given two abstract Wiener spaces i 1 : H 1 → E 1 and i 2 : H 2 → E 2 , one can show that γ 12 = γ 1 ⊗ γ 2 . In full:             (    i  1   ×   i  2    )   *    (   γ    H  1   ×   H  2     )    =       (   i  1   )   *    (   γ   H  1    )    ⊗    (   i  2   )   *     (   γ   H  2    )     ,         subscript     subscript  i  1    subscript  i  2       superscript  γ     subscript  H  1    subscript  H  2         tensor-product     subscript   subscript  i  1      superscript  γ   subscript  H  1      subscript   subscript  i  2       superscript  γ   subscript  H  2       (i_{1}\times i_{2})_{*}(\gamma^{H_{1}\times H_{2}})=(i_{1})_{*}\left(\gamma^{H%
 _{1}}\right)\otimes(i_{2})_{*}\left(\gamma^{H_{2}}\right),         i.e., the abstract Wiener measure γ 12 on the Cartesian product  E 1 × E 2 is the product of the abstract Wiener measures on the two factors E 1 and E 2 .    If H (and E ) are infinite dimensional, then the image of H has measure zero : γ ( i ( H )) = 0. This fact is a consequence of Kolmogorov's zero-one law .   Example: Classical Wiener space  Arguably the most frequently-used abstract Wiener space is the space of continuous paths , and is known as classical Wiener space . This is the abstract Wiener space with      H  :=   L  0   2  ,  1     (   [  0  ,  T  ]   ;   ℝ  n   )   :=   {  paths starting at 0 with first derivative  ∈   L  2   }      fragments  H  assign   superscript   subscript  L  0    2  1     fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-[  0  normal-,  T  normal-]   normal-;   superscript  ℝ  n   normal-)   assign   fragments  normal-{  paths starting at 0 with first derivative    superscript  L  2   normal-}     H:=L_{0}^{2,1}([0,T];\mathbb{R}^{n}):=\{\text{paths starting at 0 with first %
 derivative}\in L^{2}\}     with inner product         ⟨   σ  1   ,   σ  2   ⟩    L  0   2  ,  1     :=    ∫  0  T       ⟨     σ  ˙   1    (  t  )    ,     σ  ˙   2    (  t  )    ⟩    ℝ  n     d  t     ,     assign   subscript    subscript  σ  1    subscript  σ  2     superscript   subscript  L  0    2  1       superscript   subscript   0   T      subscript      subscript   normal-˙  σ   1   t      subscript   normal-˙  σ   2   t     superscript  ℝ  n    normal-d  t      \langle\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2}\rangle_{L_{0}^{2,1}}:=\int_{0}^{T}\langle\dot{%
 \sigma}_{1}(t),\dot{\sigma}_{2}(t)\rangle_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\,\mathrm{d}t,     E = C 0 ([0, T ]; R n ) with norm         ∥  σ  ∥    C  0    :=    sup   t  ∈   [  0  ,  T  ]       ∥   σ   (  t  )    ∥    ℝ  n      ,     assign   subscript   norm  σ    subscript  C  0      subscript  supremum    t   0  T      subscript   norm    σ  t     superscript  ℝ  n       \|\sigma\|_{C_{0}}:=\sup_{t\in[0,T]}\|\sigma(t)\|_{\mathbb{R}^{n}},     and i : H → E the inclusion map . The measure γ is called classical Wiener measure or simply Wiener measure .
