   Homotopy lifting property      Homotopy lifting property   In mathematics , in particular in homotopy theory within algebraic topology , the homotopy lifting property (also known as the right lifting property or the covering homotopy axiom ) is a technical condition on a continuous function from a topological space  E to another one, B . It is designed to support the picture of E "above" B by allowing a homotopy taking place in B to be moved "upstairs" to E .  For example, a covering map has a property of unique local lifting of paths to a given sheet; the uniqueness is due to the fact that the fibers of a covering map are discrete spaces . The homotopy lifting property will hold in many situations, such as the projection in a vector bundle , fiber bundle or fibration , where there need be no unique way of lifting.  Formal definition  Assume from now on all mappings are continuous functions from a topological space to another. Given a map    π  :   E  →  B      normal-:  π   normal-→  E  B     \pi\colon E\to B   , and a space    X    X   X\,   , one says that    (  X  ,  π  )     X  π    (X,\pi)\,   has the homotopy lifting property , 1 2 or that    π    π   \pi\,   has the homotopy lifting property with respect to    X    X   X\,   , if:   for any homotopy     f  :    X  ×   [  0  ,  1  ]    →   B       normal-:  f   normal-→    X   0  1    B     f\colon X\times[0,1]\to B\,   , and  for any map      f  ~   0   :   X  →  E      normal-:   subscript   normal-~  f   0    normal-→  X  E     \tilde{f}_{0}\colon X\to E   lifting     f  0   =    f  |    X  ×   {  0  }          subscript  f  0    evaluated-at  f    X   0       f_{0}=f|_{X\times\{0\}}   (i.e., so that     f  0   =   π  ∘     f  ~   0          subscript  f  0     π   subscript   normal-~  f   0      f_{0}=\pi\circ\tilde{f}_{0}\,   ),   there exists a homotopy     f  ~   :    X  ×   [  0  ,  1  ]    →  E      normal-:   normal-~  f    normal-→    X   0  1    E     \tilde{f}\colon X\times[0,1]\to E   lifting    f    f   f\,   (i.e., so that    f  =   π  ∘    f  ~         f    π   normal-~  f      f=\pi\circ\tilde{f}\,   ) which also satisfies      f  ~   0   =     f  ~   |    X  ×   {  0  }          subscript   normal-~  f   0    evaluated-at   normal-~  f     X   0       \tilde{f}_{0}=\tilde{f}|_{X\times\{0\}}\,   .  The following diagram depicts this situation.      The outer square (without the dotted arrow) commutes if and only if the hypotheses of the lifting property are true. A lifting    f  ~     normal-~  f    \tilde{f}   corresponds to a dotted arrow making the diagram commute. Also compare this to the visualization of the homotopy extension property .  If the map    π    π   \pi\,   satisfies the homotopy lifting property with respect to all spaces X , then    π    π   \pi\,   is called a fibration , or one sometimes simply says that     π    π   \pi\,   has the homotopy lifting property .  Note that this is the definition of fibration in the sense of Hurewicz , which is more restrictive than fibration in the sense of Serre , for which homotopy lifting only for    X    X   X\,   a CW complex is required.  Generalization: The Homotopy Lifting Extension Property  There is a common generalization of the homotopy lifting property and the homotopy extension property . Given a pair of spaces    X  ⊇  Y      Y  X    X\supseteq Y   , for simplicity we denote    T  :=    (   X  ×   {  0  }    )   ∪   (   Y  ×   [  0  ,  1  ]    )    ⊆   X  ×   [  0  ,  1  ]         assign  T      X   0      Y   0  1            X   0  1       T\colon=(X\times\{0\})\cup(Y\times[0,1])\ \subseteq\ X\times[0,1]   . Given additionally a map    π  :   E  →   B       normal-:  π   normal-→  E  B     \pi\colon E\to B\,   , one says that ''    (  X  ,  Y  ,  π  )     X  Y  π    (X,Y,\pi)\,   has the homotopy lifting extension property '' if:   For any homotopy     f  :    X  ×   [  0  ,  1  ]    →   B       normal-:  f   normal-→    X   0  1    B     f\colon X\times[0,1]\to B\,   , and  For any lifting     g  ~   :   T  →  E      normal-:   normal-~  g    normal-→  T  E     \tilde{g}\colon T\to E   of    g  =    f  |   T       g   evaluated-at  f  T     g=f|_{T}\,   ,   there exists a homotopy     f  ~   :    X  ×   [  0  ,  1  ]    →  E      normal-:   normal-~  f    normal-→    X   0  1    E     \tilde{f}\colon X\times[0,1]\to E   which covers    f    f   f\,   (i.e., such that     π   f  ~    =   f         π   normal-~  f    f    \pi\tilde{f}=f\,   ) and extends     g  ~      normal-~  g    \tilde{g}\,   (i.e., such that       f  ~   |   T   =    g  ~         evaluated-at   normal-~  f   T    normal-~  g     \tilde{f}|_{T}=\tilde{g}\,   ).  The homotopy lifting property of    (  X  ,  π  )     X  π    (X,\pi)\,   is obtained by taking    Y  =  ∅      Y     Y=\emptyset   , so that    T    T   T\,   above is simply    X  ×   {  0  }       X   0     X\times\{0\}   .  The homotopy extension property of    (  X  ,  Y  )     X  Y    (X,Y)\,   is obtained by taking    π    π   \pi\,   to be a constant map, so that    π    π   \pi\,   is irrelevant in that every map to E is trivially the lift of a constant map to the image point of    π    π   \pi\,   .
