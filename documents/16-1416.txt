Realizable k- ε Model

Introduction
The Standard k−ɛ,1 is a well-established model capable of resolving through the boundary layer.2 The second model is Realizable 𝑘−𝜀, an improvement over the standard k−ɛ model.3 it is a relatively recent development and differs from the standard k−ɛ model in two ways.The realizable k−ɛ model contains a new formulation for the turbulent viscosity and a new transport equation for the dissipation rate,ɛ, that is derived from an exact equation for the transport of the mean-square vorticity fluctuation. The term "realizable'' means that the model satisfies certain mathematical constraints on the Reynolds stresses, consistent with the physics of turbulent flows. Neither the standard k- 𝜀 model nor the RNG k- 𝜀 model is realizable. It introduces a Variable Cμ instead of constant. An immediate benefit of the realizable k- 𝜀 model is that it provides improved predictions for the spreading rate of both planar and round jets. It also exhibits superior performance for flows involving rotation, boundary layers under strong adverse pressure gradients, separation, and recirculation. In virtually every measure of comparison,Realizable 𝑘 − 𝜀 demonstrates a superior ability to capture the mean flow of the complex structures.4
