Textual Variants

3:10: εις (into) becomes προς (towards).


3:11: omits οπισω μου (after me).


3:11: βαστασαι (to bear) is changed to λυσαι (to untie). The missing space on the line above could also include κυφας (bending down), therefore almost conforming the text to the same as Mark 1:7.


3:16: ωσαι (as if it were) becomes ως (like).


3:16: και (and) is omitted from after περιστεραν (dove).


3:17: ευδοκησα (well pleased) becomes ηυδοκησα, a variant spelling.


4:2: ημερας τεσσερακοντα και νυκτας τεσσερακοντα (days forty and nights forty) becomes μ ημερας και μ νυκτας (forty days and forty nights (the numeral μ representing "forty")).
