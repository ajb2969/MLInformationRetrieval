The missing space on the line above could also include κυφας (bending down), therefore almost conforming the text to the same as Mark 1:7.    3:16: ωσαι (as if it were) becomes ως (like).    3:16: και (and) is omitted from after περιστεραν (dove).    3:17: ευδοκησα (well pleased) becomes ηυδοκησα , a variant spelling.    4:2: ημερας τεσσερακοντα και νυκτας τεσσερακοντα (days forty and nights forty) becomes μ ημερας και μ νυκτας (forty days and forty nights (the numeral μ representing "forty")).
