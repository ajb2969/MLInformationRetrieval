Affine (Determinant=0)



A1(1)



A2(2)



Hyperbolic (Determinant<0)









Note1: The multi-edged diagram corresponds to the nondiagonal Cartan matrix elements a21, a12, with the number of edges drawn equal to max(a21, a12), and an arrow pointing towards nonunity element(s). Note2: For hyperbolic groups, (a12*a21>4), the multiedge style is abandoned in favor of an explicit labeling (a21, a12) on the edge. These are usually not applied to finite and affine graphs. Note3: Many multi-edged groups are automorphic via a folding operation with a higher ranked simply-laced group.
