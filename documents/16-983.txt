Note 2 : For hyperbolic groups, (a 12 *a 21 >4), the multiedge style is abandoned in favor of an explicit labeling (a 21 , a 12 ) on the edge. These are usually not applied to finite and affine graphs. Note 3 : Many multi-edged groups are automorphic via a folding operation with a higher ranked simply-laced group.
