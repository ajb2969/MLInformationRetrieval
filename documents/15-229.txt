   Gelfand–Kirillov dimension      Gelfand–Kirillov dimension   In algebra , the Gelfand–Kirillov dimension (or GK dimension ) of a right module  M over a k -algebra  A is:      GKdim  =    sup   V  ,   M  0       lim sup   n  →  ∞      log  n     dim  k     M  0    V  n            GKdim    subscript  supremum   V   subscript  M  0       subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n        subscript   n     subscript  dimension  k      subscript  M  0    superscript  V  n          \operatorname{GKdim}=\sup_{V,M_{0}}\limsup_{n\to\infty}\log_{n}\dim_{k}M_{0}V^%
 {n}     where the sup is taken over all finite-dimensional subspaces     V  ⊂  A      V  A    V\subset A   and     M  0   ⊂  M       subscript  M  0   M    M_{0}\subset M   .  An algebra is said to have polynomial growth if its Gelfand–Kirillov dimension is finite.  Basic facts   The Gelfand–Kirillov dimension of a finitely generated commutative algebra A over a field is the Krull dimension of A (or equivalently the transcendence degree of the field of fractions of A over the base field.)  In particular, the GK dimension of the polynomial ring    k   [   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   ]       k    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      k[x_{1},\dots,x_{n}]   Is n .  (Warfield) For any real number ''r ''≥ 2, there exists a finitely generated algebra whose GK dimension is r . 1   In the theory of D-Modules  Given a right module M over the Weyl algebra     A  n     subscript  A  n    A_{n}   , the Gelfand–Kirillov dimension of M over the Weyl algebra coincides with the dimension of M , which is by definition the degree of the Hilbert polynomial of M . This enables to prove additivity in short exact sequences for the Gelfand–Kirillov dimension and finally to prove Bernstein's inequality , which states that the dimension of M must be at least n . This leads to the definition of holonomic D-Modules as those with the minimal dimension n , and these modules play a great role in the geometric Langlands program .
