   Koszul complex      Koszul complex   In mathematics , the Koszul complex was first introduced to define a cohomology theory for Lie algebras , by Jean-Louis Koszul (see Lie algebra cohomology ). It turned out to be a useful general construction in homological algebra .  Introduction  In commutative algebra , if x is an element of the ring R , multiplication by x is R -linear and so represents an R - module  homomorphism  x : R ‚Üí R from R to itself. It is useful to throw in zeroes on each end and make this a (free) R -complex:      0  ‚Üí  R   ‚Üí  ùë•   R  ‚Üí  0.       normal-‚Üí  0  R     x  normal-‚Üí     R    normal-‚Üí    0.     0\to R\xrightarrow{\ x\ }R\to 0.     Call this chain complex  K ‚Ä¢ ( x ).  Counting the right-hand copy of R as the zeroth degree and the left-hand copy as the first degree, this chain complex neatly captures the most important facts about multiplication by x because its zeroth homology is exactly the homomorphic image of R modulo the multiples of x , H 0 ( K ‚Ä¢ ( x )) = R / xR , and its first homology is exactly the annihilator of x , H 1 ( K ‚Ä¢ ( x )) = Ann R ( x ).  This chain complex K ‚Ä¢ ( x ) is called the Koszul complex of R with respect to x .  Now, if x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n are elements of R , the Koszul complex of R with respect to x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n , usually denoted K ‚Ä¢ ( x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n ), is the tensor product in the category of R -complexes of the Koszul complexes defined above individually for each i .  The Koszul complex is a free chain complex. There are exactly ( n choose j ) copies of the ring R in the j th degree in the complex (0 ‚â§ j ‚â§ n ). The matrices involved in the maps can be written down precisely. Letting    e    i  1   ‚Ä¶   i  p       subscript  e     subscript  i  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  i  p      e_{i_{1}...i_{p}}   denote a free-basis generator in K p , d : K p    ‚Ü¶   maps-to   \mapsto    K p ‚àí 1 is defined by:        d   (   e    i  1   ‚Ä¶   i  p     )    :=    ‚àë   j  =  1   p      (   -  1   )    j  -  1     x   i  j     e    i  1   ‚Ä¶    i  j   ^   ‚Ä¶   i  p        .     assign    d   subscript  e     subscript  i  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  i  p        superscript   subscript     j  1    p      superscript    1     j  1     subscript  x   subscript  i  j     subscript  e     subscript  i  1   normal-‚Ä¶   normal-^   subscript  i  j    normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  i  p         d(e_{i_{1}...i_{p}}):=\sum_{j=1}^{p}(-1)^{j-1}x_{i_{j}}e_{i_{1}...\widehat{i_{%
 j}}...i_{p}}.     For the case of two elements x and y , the Koszul complex can then be written down quite succinctly as       0  ‚Üí  R   ‚Üí     d   2      R  2    ‚Üí     d   1     R  ‚Üí  0   ,       normal-‚Üí  0  R      subscript  d  2   normal-‚Üí      superscript  R  2       subscript  d  1   normal-‚Üí     R    normal-‚Üí    0     0\to R\xrightarrow{\ d_{2}\ }R^{2}\xrightarrow{\ d_{1}\ }R\to 0,   with the matrices    d  1     subscript  d  1    d_{1}   and    d  2     subscript  d  2    d_{2}   given by       d  1   =   [     x    y     ]        subscript  d  1     x  y      d_{1}=\begin{bmatrix}x&y\\
 \end{bmatrix}   and        d  2   =   [      -  y       x     ]    .       subscript  d  2       y     x      d_{2}=\begin{bmatrix}-y\\
 x\\
 \end{bmatrix}.   Note that d i is applied on the left. The cycles in degree 1 are then exactly the linear relations on the elements x and y , while the boundaries are the trivial relations. The first Koszul homology H 1 ( K ‚Ä¢ ( x , y )) therefore measures exactly the relations mod the trivial relations. With more elements the higher-dimensional Koszul homologies measure the higher-level versions of this.  In the case that the elements x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n form a regular sequence , the higher homology modules of the Koszul complex are all zero.  Example  If k is a field and X 1 , X 2 , ..., X d are indeterminates and R is the polynomial ring k [ X 1 , X 2 , ..., X d ], the Koszul complex K ‚Ä¢ ( X i ) on the X i 's forms a concrete free R -resolution of k .  Theorem  Let ( R , m ) be a Noetherian  local ring with maximal ideal m , and let M be a finitely-generated R -module. If x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n are elements of the maximal ideal m , then the following are equivalent:   The ( x i ) form a regular sequence on M ,  H j ( K ‚Ä¢ ( x i )) = 0 for all j ‚â• 1.   Applications  The Koszul complex is essential in defining the joint spectrum of a tuple of bounded linear operators in a Banach space .
