   Direct sum of groups      Direct sum of groups   In mathematics , a group  G is called the direct sum  1 2 of two subgroups  H 1 and H 2 if   each H 1 and H 2 are normal subgroups of G  the subgroups H 1 and H 2 have trivial intersection (i.e., having only the identity element    e   e   e   in common), and  G = 1 , H 2 >; in other words, G is generated by the subgroups H 1 and H 2 .   More generally, G is called the direct sum of a finite set of subgroups { H i } if   each H i is a normal subgroup of G  each H i has trivial intersection with the subgroup j : j not equal to i }>, and  G = i }>; in other words, G is generated by the subgroups { H i }.   If G is the direct sum of subgroups H and K , then we write G = H + K ; if G is the direct sum of a set of subgroups { H i }, we often write G = ∑ H i . Loosely speaking, a direct sum is isomorphic to a weak direct product of subgroups.  In abstract algebra , this method of construction can be generalized to direct sums of vector spaces , modules , and other structures; see the article direct sum of modules for more information.  This notation is commutative ; so that in the case of the direct sum of two subgroups, G = H + K = K + H . It is also associative in the sense that if G = H + K , and K = L + M , then G = H + ( L + M ) = H + L + M .  A group which can be expressed as a direct sum of non-trivial subgroups is called decomposable ; otherwise it is called indecomposable .  If G = H + K , then it can be proven that:   for all h in H , k in K , we have that h * k = k * h  for all g in G , there exists unique h in H , k in K such that g = h * k  There is a cancellation of the sum in a quotient; so that ( H + K )/ K is isomorphic to H   The above assertions can be generalized to the case of G = ∑ H i , where { H i } is a finite set of subgroups.   if i ≠ j , then for all h i in H i , h j in H j , we have that h i * h j = h j * h i  for each g in G , there unique set of { h i in H i } such that    g = h 1 * h 2 * ... * h i * ... * h n     There is a cancellation of the sum in a quotient; so that ((∑ H i ) + K )/ K is isomorphic to ∑ H i   Note the similarity with the direct product , where each g can be expressed uniquely as   g = ( h 1 , h 2 , ..., h i , ..., h n )   Since h i * h j = h j * h i for all i ≠ j , it follows that multiplication of elements in a direct sum is isomorphic to multiplication of the corresponding elements in the direct product; thus for finite sets of subgroups, ∑ H i is isomorphic to the direct product ×{ H i }.  Direct summand  Given a group   G   G   G   , we say that a subgroup   H   H   H   is a direct summand of   G   G   G   (or that splits form   G   G   G   ) if and only if there exist another subgroup    K  ≤  G      K  G    K\leq G   such that   G   G   G   is the direct sum of the subgroups   H   H   H   and   K   K   K     In abelian groups, if   H   H   H   is a divisible subgroup of   G   G   G   then   H   H   H   is a direct summand of   G   G   G   .  Examples   If we take       G  =    ∏   i  ∈  I     H  i        G    subscript  product    i  I     subscript  H  i      G=\prod_{i\in I}H_{i}   it is clear that   G   G   G   is the direct product of the subgroups     H   i  0    ×    ∏   i  ≠   i  0      H  i         subscript  H   subscript  i  0      subscript  product    i   subscript  i  0      subscript  H  i      H_{i_{0}}\times\prod_{i\not=i_{0}}H_{i}   .   If   H   H   H   is a divisible subgroup of an abelian group   G   G   G   . Then there exist another subgroup    K  ≤  G      K  G    K\leq G   such that    G  =   K  +  H       G    K  H     G=K+H       If   G   G   G   is also a vector space then   G   G   G   can be written as a direct sum of   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   and another subespace   K   K   K   that will be isomorphic to the quotient    G  /  K      G  K    G/K   .   Equivalence of decompositions into direct sums  In the decomposition of a finite group into a direct sum of indecomposable subgroups the embedding of the subgroups is not unique; for example, in the Klein group , V 4 = C 2 × C 2 , we have that   V 4 =  +  and  V 4 =  + .   However, it is the content of the Remak-Krull-Schmidt theorem that given a finite group G = ∑ A i = ∑ B j , where each A i and each B j is non-trivial and indecomposable, the two sums have equal terms up to reordering and isomorphism.  The Remak-Krull-Schmidt theorem fails for infinite groups; so in the case of infinite G = H + K = L + M , even when all subgroups are non-trivial and indecomposable, we cannot then assume that H is isomorphic to either L or M .  Generalization to sums over infinite sets  To describe the above properties in the case where G is the direct sum of an infinite (perhaps uncountable) set of subgroups, more care is needed.  If g is an element of the cartesian product ∏{ H i } of a set of groups, let g i be the i th element of g in the product. The external direct sum of a set of groups { H i } (written as ∑ E {H ''i'' }) is the subset of ∏{ H'' i }, where, for each element g of ∑ E {H'' i }, g i is the identity    e   H  i      subscript  e   subscript  H  i     e_{H_{i}}   for all but a finite number of g i (equivalently, only a finite number of g i are not the identity). The group operation in the external direct sum is pointwise multiplication, as in the usual direct product.  This subset does indeed form a group; and for a finite set of groups H i , the external direct sum is identical to the direct product.  If G = ∑ H i , then G is isomorphic to ∑ E { H i }. Thus, in a sense, the direct sum is an "internal" external direct sum. For each element g in G , there is a unique finite set S and unique { h i in H i : i in S } such that g = ∏ { h i : i in S }.
