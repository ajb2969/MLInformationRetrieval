   Number theoretic Hilbert transform      Number theoretic Hilbert transform   The number theoretic Hilbert transform is an extension 1 of the discrete Hilbert transform to integers modulo a prime   p   p   p    . The transformation operator is a circulant matrix .  The number theoretic transform is meaningful in the ring     ℤ  m     subscript  ℤ  m    \mathbb{Z}_{m}   , when the modulus   m   m   m   is not prime, provided a principal root of order n exists. The    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n   NHT matrix, where    n  =   2  m       n    2  m     n=2m   , has the form        N  H  T   =   [     0     a  m     …    0     a  1        a  1     0     a  m        0      ⋮     a  1     0    ⋱    ⋮      0       ⋱    ⋱     a  m        a  m     0    …     a  1     0     ]    .        N  H  T     0   subscript  a  m   normal-…  0   subscript  a  1      subscript  a  1   0   subscript  a  m   absent  0    normal-⋮   subscript  a  1   0  normal-⋱  normal-⋮    0  absent  normal-⋱  normal-⋱   subscript  a  m      subscript  a  m   0  normal-…   subscript  a  1   0      NHT=\begin{bmatrix}0&a_{m}&\dots&0&a_{1}\\
 a_{1}&0&a_{m}&&0\\
 \vdots&a_{1}&0&\ddots&\vdots\\
 0&&\ddots&\ddots&a_{m}\\
 a_{m}&0&\dots&a_{1}&0\\
 \end{bmatrix}.     The rows are the cyclic permutations of the first row, or the columns may be seen as the cyclic permutations of the first column. The NHT is its own inverse      N  H   T  T   N  H  T   =   N  H  T  N  H   T  T    =   I  mod  p    ,          N  H   superscript  T  normal-T   N  H  T     N  H  T  N  H   superscript  T  normal-T          modulo  I  p      NHT^{\mathrm{T}}NHT=NHTNHT^{\mathrm{T}}=I\bmod\ p,\,   where I is the identity matrix .  The number theoretic Hilbert transform can be used to generate sets of orthogonal discrete sequences that have applications in signal processing , wireless systems, and cryptography . 2 Other ways to generate constrained orthogonal sequences also exist. 3 4  References  See also   Number theoretic transform   "  Category:Signal processing     * ↩   1 ↩  Donelan, H.
