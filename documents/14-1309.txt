   Orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle      Orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle   In mathematics, orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle are families of polynomials that are orthogonal with respect to integration over the unit circle in the complex plane , for some probability measure on the unit circle. They were introduced by .  Definition  Suppose that μ is a probability measure on the unit circle in the complex plane, whose support is not finite. The orthogonal polynomials associated to μ are the polynomials Φ n ( z ) with leading coefficients z n that are orthogonal with respect to the measure μ.  The Szegő recurrence  Szegő's recurrence states that        Φ   n  +  1     (  z  )    =    z   Φ  n    (  z  )    -     α  ¯   n    Φ  n  *    (  z  )            subscript  normal-Φ    n  1    z       z   subscript  normal-Φ  n   z      subscript   normal-¯  α   n    superscript   subscript  normal-Φ  n     z      \Phi_{n+1}(z)=z\Phi_{n}(z)-\overline{\alpha}_{n}\Phi_{n}^{*}(z)   where        Φ  n  *    (  z  )    =    z  n      Φ  n    (   1  /   z  ¯    )    ¯           superscript   subscript  normal-Φ  n     z      superscript  z  n    normal-¯     subscript  normal-Φ  n     1   normal-¯  z         \Phi_{n}^{*}(z)=z^{n}\overline{\Phi_{n}(1/\overline{z})}   is the polynomial with its coefficients reversed and complex conjugated, and where the Verblunsky coefficients α n are complex numbers with absolute values less than 1.  Verblunsky's theorem  Verblunsky's theorem states that any sequence of complex numbers in the open unit disk is the sequence of Verblunsky coefficients for a unique probability measure on the unit circle with infinite support.  Geronimus's theorem  Geronimus's theorem states that the Verblunsky coefficients of the measure μ are the Schur parameters of the function f defined by the equations         1  +   z  f   (  z  )      1  -   z  f   (  z  )      =   F   (  z  )    =   ∫      e   i  θ    +  z     e   i  θ    -  z    d  μ     .            1    z  f  z      1    z  f  z       F  z                 superscript  e    i  θ    z      superscript  e    i  θ    z    d  μ       \frac{1+zf(z)}{1-zf(z)}=F(z)=\int\frac{e^{i\theta}+z}{e^{i\theta}-z}d\mu.     Baxter's theorem  Baxter's theorem states that the Verblunsky coefficients form an absolutely convergent series if and only if the moments of μ form an absolutely convergent series and the weight function w is strictly positive everywhere.  Szegő's theorem  Szegő's theorem states that       ∏   (   1  -    |   α  j   |   2    )    =   exp   (    ∫  0   2  π        log   (   w   (  θ  )    )    d  θ   /  2   π    )         product    1   superscript     subscript  α  j    2         superscript   subscript   0     2  π              w  θ    d  θ   2   π       \prod(1-|\alpha_{j}|^{2})=\exp\big(\int_{0}^{2\pi}\log(w(\theta))d\theta/2\pi\big)   where wd θ/2π is the absolutely continuous part of the measure μ.  Rakhmanov's theorem  Rakhmanov's theorem states that if the absolutely continuous part w of the measure μ is positive almost everywhere then the Verblunsky coefficients α n tend to 0.
