   Topological excitations      Topological excitations   Topological excitations are certain features of classical solutions of gauge field theories .  Namely, a gauge field theory on a manifold    M   M   M   with a gauge group    G   G   G   may possess classical solutions with a (quantized) topological invariant called topological charge . The term topological excitation especially refers to a situation when the topological charge is an integral of a localized quantity.  Examples: 1  1)    M  =   R  2       M   superscript  R  2     M=R^{2}   ,    G  =   U   (  1  )        G    U  1     G=U(1)   , the topological charge is called magnetic flux .  2)    M  =   R  3       M   superscript  R  3     M=R^{3}   ,    G  =     S  O   (  3  )    /  U    (  1  )        G        S  O  3   U   1     G=SO(3)/U(1)   , the topological charge is called magnetic charge .  The concept of a topological excitation is almost synonymous with that of a topological defect .  References  "  Category:Theoretical physics     F. A.
