Topological excitations

Topological excitations are certain features of classical solutions of gauge field theories.
Namely, a gauge field theory on a manifold

 
  with a gauge group

 
  may possess classical solutions with a (quantized) topological invariant called topological charge. The term topological excitation especially refers to a situation when the topological charge is an integral of a localized quantity.
Examples:1
1) 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , the topological charge is called magnetic flux.
2) 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , the topological charge is called magnetic charge.
The concept of a topological excitation is almost synonymous with that of a topological defect.
