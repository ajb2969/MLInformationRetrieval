   Voronoi pole      Voronoi pole   In geometry , the positive and negative Voronoi poles of a cell in a Voronoi diagram are certain vertices of the diagram.  Definition  Let    V  p     subscript  V  p    V_{p}   be the Voronoi cell of the site    p  ∈  P      p  P    p\in P   . If    V  p     subscript  V  p    V_{p}   is bounded then its positive pole is the Voronoi vertex in    V  p     subscript  V  p    V_{p}   with maximal distance to the sample point   p   p   p   . Furthermore, let    u  ¯     normal-¯  u    \bar{u}   be the vector from   p   p   p   to the positive pole. If the cell is unbounded, then a positive pole is not defined, and    u  ¯     normal-¯  u    \bar{u}   is defined to be a vector in the average direction of all unbounded Voronoi edges of the cell.  The negative pole is the Voronoi vertex   v   v   v   in    V  p     subscript  V  p    V_{p}   with the largest distance to   p   p   p   such that the vector    u  ¯     normal-¯  u    \bar{u}   and the vector from   p   p   p   to   v   v   v   make an angle larger than    π  2      π  2    \frac{\pi}{2}   .  Example  (Figure)  Example of poles in a Voronoi diagram   Here   x   x   x   is the positive pole of    V  p     subscript  V  p    V_{p}   and   y   y   y   its negative. As the cell corresponding to   q   q   q   is unbounded only the negative pole   z   z   z   exists.  References     "  Category:Geometry
