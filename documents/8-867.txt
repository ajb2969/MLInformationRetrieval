   Sommerfeld radiation condition      Sommerfeld radiation condition   Arnold Sommerfeld defined the condition of radiation for a scalar field satisfying the Helmholtz equation as   "the sources must be sources, not sinks of energy. The energy which is radiated from the sources must scatter to infinity; no energy may be radiated from infinity into ... the field." 1    Mathematically, consider the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation        (    ∇  2   +   k  2    )   u   =   -   f  in   ℝ  n              superscript  normal-∇  2    superscript  k  2    u       f  in   superscript  ℝ  n       (\nabla^{2}+k^{2})u=-f\mbox{ in }\mathbb{R}^{n}     where    n  =   2  ,  3       n   2  3     n=2,3   is the dimension of the space,   f   f   f   is a given function with compact support representing a bounded source of energy, and    k  >  0      k  0    k>0   is a constant, called the wavenumber . A solution   u   u   u   to this equation is called radiating if it satisfies the Sommerfeld radiation condition        lim    |  x  |   →  ∞       |  x  |     n  -  1   2     (    ∂   ∂   |  x  |     -   i  k    )   u   (  x  )     =  0        subscript    normal-→    x         superscript    x       n  1   2             x       i  k    u  x    0    \lim_{|x|\to\infty}|x|^{\frac{n-1}{2}}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial|x|}-ik%
 \right)u(x)=0     uniformly in all directions       x  ^   =   x   |  x  |         normal-^  x     x    x      \hat{x}=\frac{x}{|x|}     (above,   i   i   i   is the imaginary unit and    |  ⋅  |     fragments  normal-|  normal-⋅  normal-|    |\cdot|   is the Euclidean norm ). Here, it is assumed that the time-harmonic field is      e   -   i  ω  t     u   .       superscript  e      i  ω  t     u    e^{-i\omega t}u.   If the time-harmonic field is instead      e   i  ω  t    u   ,       superscript  e    i  ω  t    u    e^{i\omega t}u,   one should replace    -  i      i    -i   with    +  i      i    +i   in the Sommerfeld radiation condition.  The Sommerfeld radiation condition is used to solve uniquely the Helmholtz equation. For example, consider the problem of radiation due to a point source    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   in three dimensions, so the function   f   f   f   in the Helmholtz equation is      f   (  x  )    =   δ   (   x  -   x  0    )     ,        f  x     δ    x   subscript  x  0       f(x)=\delta(x-x_{0}),   where   δ   δ   \delta   is the Dirac delta function . This problem has an infinite number of solutions, for example, any function of the form      u  =    c   u  +    +    (   1  -  c   )     u  -          u      c   subscript  u         1  c    subscript  u        u=cu_{+}+(1-c)u_{-}\,     where   c   c   c   is a constant, and         u  ±    (  x  )    =    e   ±   i  k   |   x  -   x  0    |       4  π   |   x  -   x  0    |      .         subscript  u  plus-or-minus   x      superscript  e   plus-or-minus    i  k      x   subscript  x  0          4  π      x   subscript  x  0         u_{\pm}(x)=\frac{e^{\pm ik|x-x_{0}|}}{4\pi|x-x_{0}|}.     Of all these solutions, only    u  +     subscript  u     u_{+}   satisfies the Sommerfeld radiation condition and corresponds to a field radiating from     x  0   .     subscript  x  0    x_{0}.   The other solutions are unphysical. For example,    u  -     subscript  u     u_{-}   can be interpreted as energy coming from infinity and sinking at     x  0   .     subscript  x  0    x_{0}.
