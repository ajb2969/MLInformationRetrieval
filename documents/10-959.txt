Terephthalate 1,2-cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a terephthalate 1,2-cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

cis-4,5-dihydroxycyclohexa-1(6),2-diene-1,4-dicarboxylate + NAD+

 
  3,4-dihydroxybenzoate + CO2 + NADH
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cis-4,5-dihydroxycyclohexa-1(6),2-diene-1,4-dicarboxylate and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, CO2, and NADH.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cis-4,5-dihydroxycyclohexa-1(6),2-diene-1,4-dicarboxylate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating). This enzyme participates in 2,4-dichlorobenzoate degradation.
