   Gradient-like vector field      Gradient-like vector field   In differential topology , a mathematical discipline, and more specifically in Morse theory , a gradient-like vector field is a generalization of gradient vector field .  The primary motivation is as a technical tool in the construction of Morse functions , to show that one can construct a function whose critical points are at distinct levels. One first constructs a Morse function, then uses gradient-like vector fields to move around the critical points, yielding a different Morse function.  Definition  Given a Morse function  f on a manifold M, a gradient-like vector field X for the function f is, informally:   away from critical points, X points "in the same direction as" the gradient of f, and  near a critical point (in the neighborhood of a critical point), it equals the gradient of f, when f is written in standard form given in the Morse lemmas .   Formally: 1   away from critical points,      X  ⋅  f   >  0   ,       normal-⋅  X  f   0    X\cdot f>0,     around every critical point there is a neighborhood on which f is given as in the Morse lemmas:        f   (  x  )    =     f   (  b  )    -   x  1  2   -  ⋯  -   x  α  2    +   x   α  +  1   2   +  ⋯  +   x  n  2          f  x         f  b    superscript   subscript  x  1   2   normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  x  α   2     superscript   subscript  x    α  1    2   normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  x  n   2      f(x)=f(b)-x_{1}^{2}-\cdots-x_{\alpha}^{2}+x_{\alpha+1}^{2}+\cdots+x_{n}^{2}   and on which X equals the gradient of f.  Dynamical system  The associated dynamical system of a gradient-like vector field, a gradient-like dynamical system , is a special case of a Morse–Smale system .
