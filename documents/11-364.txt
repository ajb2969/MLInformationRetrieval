   Nucleoside-triphosphate diphosphatase      Nucleoside-triphosphate diphosphatase   In enzymology , a nucleoside-triphosphate diphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a nucleoside triphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a nucleotide + diphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are nucleoside triphosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are nucleotide and diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is nucleoside-triphosphate diphosphohydrolase . This enzyme is also called nucleoside-triphosphate pyrophosphatase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism .  For example, enzyme deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphatase, encoded by YJR069C in S. cerevisiae and exhibiting (d)ITPase and (d)XTPase activities, hydrolyses ITP , dITP , XTP and dXTP releasing pyrophosphate and IMP , dIMP , XMP and dXMP , respectively. 1  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
