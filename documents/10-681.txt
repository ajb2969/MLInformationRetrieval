   6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin 2'-reductase      6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin 2'-reductase   In enzymology , a 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin 2'-reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   6-lactoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 6-lactoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-lactoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin:NADP + 2'-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin reductase , 6PPH4(2'-oxo) reductase , 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin (2'-oxo)reductase , 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin 2'-reductase , and pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin reductase . This enzyme participates in folate biosynthesis .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
