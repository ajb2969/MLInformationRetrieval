Cellular homology

In mathematics, cellular homology in algebraic topology is a homology theory for the category of CW-complexes. It agrees with singular homology, and can provide an effective means of computing homology modules.
Definition
If 
 
 
 
  is a CW-complex with n-skeleton

 
 , the cellular-homology modules are defined as the homology groups of the cellular chain complex



where 
 
 
 
  is taken to be the empty set.
The group



is free abelian, with generators that can be identified with the 
 
 
 
 -cells of 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be an 
 
 
 
 -cell of 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be the attaching map. Then consider the composition



where the first map identifies 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  via the characteristic map 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , the object 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
 -cell of X, the third map 
 
 
 
  is the quotient map that collapses 
 
 
 
  to a point (thus wrapping 
 
 
 
  into a sphere 
 
 
 
 ), and the last map identifies 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  via the characteristic map 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 .
The boundary map



is then given by the formula



where 
 
 
 
  is the degree of 
 
 
 
  and the sum is taken over all 
 
 
 
 -cells of 
 
 
 
 , considered as generators of 
 
 
 
 .
Other Properties
One sees from the cellular-chain complex that the 
 
 
 
 -skeleton determines all lower-dimensional homology modules:



for 
 
 
 
 .
An important consequence of this cellular perspective is that if a CW-complex has no cells in consecutive dimensions, then all of its homology modules are free. For example, the complex projective space

 
  has a cell structure with one cell in each even dimension; it follows that for 
 
 
 
 ,



and



Generalization
The Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence is the analogous method of computing the (co)homology of a CW-complex, for an arbitrary extraordinary (co)homology theory.
Euler Characteristic
For a cellular complex 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be its 
 
 
 
 -th skeleton, and 
 
 
 
  be the number of 
 
 
 
 -cells, i.e., the rank of the free module 
 
 
 
 . The Euler characteristic of 
 
 
 
  is then defined by



The Euler characteristic is a homotopy invariant. In fact, in terms of the Betti numbers of 
 
 
 
 ,



This can be justified as follows. Consider the long exact sequence of relative homology for the triple 
 
 
 
 :



Chasing exactness through the sequence gives



The same calculation applies to the triples 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , etc. By induction,
