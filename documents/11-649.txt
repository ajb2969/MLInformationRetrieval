   2-aminomuconate deaminase      2-aminomuconate deaminase   In enzymology , a 2-aminomuconate deaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-aminomuconate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-oxalocrotonate + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-aminomuconate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 4-oxalocrotonate and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in compounds that have not been otherwise categorized within EC number 3.5. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-aminomuconate aminohydrolase . This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism .
