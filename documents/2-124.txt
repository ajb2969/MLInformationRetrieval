Lah number

 In mathematics, the Lah numbers, discovered by Ivo Lah in 1955,1 are coefficients expressing rising factorials in terms of falling factorials.
Unsigned Lah numbers have an interesting meaning in combinatorics: they count the number of ways a set of n elements can be partitioned into k nonempty linearly ordered subsets. Lah numbers are related to Stirling numbers.

Signed Lah numbers :



L(n, 1) is always n!; in the interpretation above, the only partition of {1, 2, 3} into 1 set can have its set ordered in 6 ways:

{(1, 2, 3)}, {(1, 3, 2)}, {(2, 1, 3)}, {(2, 3, 1)}, {(3, 1, 2)} or {(3, 2, 1)}
 

L(3, 2) corresponds to the 6 partitions with two ordered parts:

{(1), (2, 3)}, {(1), (3, 2)}, {(2), (1, 3)}, {(2), (3, 1)}, {(3), (1, 2)} or {(3), (2, 1)}
 

L(n, n) is always 1 since, e.g., partitioning {1, 2, 3} into 3 non-empty subsets results in subsets of length 1.

{(1), (2), (3)}
 

Adapting the Karamata-Knuth notation for Stirling numbers, it has been proposed to use the following alternative notation for Lah numbers:



Rising and falling factorials
Let 
 
 
 
  represent the rising factorial 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  represent the falling factorial 
 
 
 
 .
Then 
 
 
 
  and
