Renilla-luciferin 2-monooxygenase

Renilla-luciferin 2-monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

Renilla luciferin + O2

 
  oxidized Renilla luciferin + CO2 + hÎ½
 

The two substrates of this enzyme are Coelenterazine and O2, whereas its 3 products are coelenteramide, CO2, and a photon of blue light.
This enzyme was isolated from Renilla reniformis, the sea pansy, a bioluminescent sea pen. The enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on single donors with O2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O with incorporation of one atom of oxygen (internal monooxygenases o internal mixed-function oxidases).
In vivo, the photon emitted by Renilla-luciferin 2-monooxygenase is transferred to green fluorescent protein, causing it to emit green light.
The systematic name of this enzyme class is Renilla-luciferin:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase (decarboxylating). Other names in common use include Renilla-type luciferase, aequorin, and luciferase (Renilla luciferin).
