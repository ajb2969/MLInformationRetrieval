Synge's world function

In general relativity, Synge's world function is an example of a bitensor, i.e. a tensorial function of pairs of points in the spacetime. Let 
 
 
 
  be two points in spacetime, and suppose 
 
 
 
  belongs to a normal convex neighborhood of 
 
 
 
  so that there exists a unique geodesic

 
  from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , up to the affine parameter 
 
 
 
 . Suppose 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Then Synge's world function is defined as:


 
  where the integral is evaluated along the geodesic connecting the two points. That is, 
 
 
 
  is half the square of the geodesic length from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . Synge's world function is well-defined, since the integral above is invariant under reparametrization. In particular, for Minkowski spacetime, the Synge's world function simplifies to half the spacetime interval between the two points:
