In mathematics, in the fields of differential geometry and algebraic geometry, the Enneper surface is a self-intersecting surface that can be described parametrically by:








 
  It was introduced by Alfred Enneper 1864 in connection with minimal surface theory.1234
The Weierstrass–Enneper parameterization is very simple, 
 
 
 
 , and the real parametric form can easily be calculated from it. The surface is conjugate to itself.
Implicitization methods of algebraic geometry can be used to find out that the points in the Enneper surface given above satisfy the degree-9 polynomial equation









Dually, the tangent plane at the point with given parameters is 
 
 
 
  where











 
  Its coefficients satisfy the implicit degree-6 polynomial equation






The Jacobian, Gaussian curvature and mean curvature are








 
  The total curvature is 
 
 
 
 . Osserman proved that a complete minimal surface in 
 
 
 
  with total curvature 
 
 
 
  is either the catenoid or the Enneper surface.5
Another property is that all bicubical minimal Bézier surfaces are, up to an affine transformation, pieces of the surface.6
It can be generalized to higher order rotational symmetries by using the Weierstrass–Enneper parameterization 
 
 
 
  for integer k>1.7 It can also be generalized to higher dimensions; Enneper-like surfaces are known to exist in 
 
 
 
  for n up to 7.8
