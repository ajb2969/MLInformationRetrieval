   S2P (complexity)      S2P (complexity)   In computational complexity theory , S is a complexity class , intermediate between the first and second levels of the polynomial hierarchy . A language   L   L   L   is in    S  2  P     superscript   subscript  S  2   P    S_{2}^{P}   if there exists a polynomial-time predicate P such that   If    x  ∈  L      x  L    x\in L   , then there exists a y such that for all z ,     P   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    =  1        P   x  y  z    1    P(x,y,z)=1   ,  If    x  ∉  L      x  L    x\notin L   , then there exists a z such that for all y ,     P   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    =  0        P   x  y  z    0    P(x,y,z)=0   ,   where size of y and z must be polynomial of x .  Relationship to other complexity classes  It is immediate from the definition that S is closed under union and complement. Comparing the definition with that of    Σ  2  P     superscript   subscript  normal-Σ  2   P    \Sigma_{2}^{P}   and    Π  2  P     superscript   subscript  normal-Π  2   P    \Pi_{2}^{P}   , it also follows immediately that S is contained in     Σ  2  P   ∩   Π  2  P        superscript   subscript  normal-Σ  2   P    superscript   subscript  normal-Π  2   P     \Sigma_{2}^{P}\cap\Pi_{2}^{P}   . This inclusion can in fact be strengthened to ZPP NP .  | url = http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jyc/papers/S2-j.pdf  | volume = 73  | year = 2007}}. A preliminary version of this paper appeared earlier, in FOCS 2001, , , .  Every language in NP also belongs to  For by definition, a language L is in NP, if and only if there exists a polynomial-time verifier V ( x , y ), such that for every x in L there exists y for which V answers true, and such that for every x not in L , V always answers false. But such a verifier can easily be transformed into an  predicate P ( x , y , z ) for the same language that ignores z and otherwise behaves the same as V . By the same token, co-NP belongs to  These straightforward inclusions can be strengthened to show that the class  contains MA (by a generalization of the Sipser–Lautemann theorem ) and    Δ  2  P     superscript   subscript  normal-Δ  2   P    \Delta_{2}^{P}   (more generally,     P   S  2  P    =   S  2  P        superscript  P   superscript   subscript  S  2   P     superscript   subscript  S  2   P     P^{S_{2}^{P}}=S_{2}^{P}   ).  Karp–Lipton theorem  A version of Karp–Lipton theorem states that if every language in NP has polynomial size circuits then the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to S. This result yields a strengthening of Kannan's theorem: it is known that S is not contained in SIZE ( n k ) for any fixed k .  Symmetric hierarchy  As an extension, it is possible to define    S  2     subscript  S  2    S_{2}   as an operator on complexity classes; then      S  2   P   =   S  2  P          subscript  S  2   P    superscript   subscript  S  2   P     S_{2}P=S_{2}^{P}   . Iteration of    S  2     subscript  S  2    S_{2}   operator yields a "symmetric hierarchy"; the union of the classes produced in this way is equal to the Polynomial hierarchy .
