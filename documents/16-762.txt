   Poisson point process      Poisson point process   In probability theory , a Poisson point process is a particular kind of random process by which a set of isolated points are scattered about a line or a plane or a three-dimensional space or any of various other sorts of spaces. Often the term Poisson process is used to mean a Poisson point process in which the space in which isolated points are randomly scattered is a line, which in many applications represents time.  History  The concept is named after the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson .  Characterization  The Poisson point process is characterized by the following properties:   The numbers of isolated points falling within two regions A and B are independent  random variables if A and B do not intersect each other;  The expected number of isolated points falling within a region A is the measure of the region A . This "measure" is often proportional to the area or volume of A , but sometimes more elaborate measures are used. But the measure must be defined in such a way that the measure of the union of regions that do not intersect each other is simply the sum of their measures.   A consequence of these characterizing properties is that the probability distribution of the number X of isolated points falling within any region A is a Poisson distribution , which means that       Pr   (   X  =  x   )    =      (   μ   (  A  )    )   x    e   -   μ   (  A  )        x  !         Pr    X  x         superscript    μ  A   x    superscript  e      μ  A        x      \Pr(X=x)=\frac{(\mu(A))^{x}e^{-\mu(A)}}{x!}     where μ ( A ) is the measure of the region A .
