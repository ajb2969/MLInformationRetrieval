   AMP—thymidine kinase      AMP—thymidine kinase   In enzymology , an AMP—thymidine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   AMP + thymidine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine + thymidine 5'-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are AMP and thymidine , whereas its two products are adenosine and thymidine 5'-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is AMP:thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase . This enzyme is also called adenylate-nucleoside phosphotransferase .
