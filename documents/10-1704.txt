Styrene-oxide isomerase




Styrene-oxide isomerase

In enzymology, a styrene-oxide isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

styrene oxide 
 
 
 
  phenylacetaldehyde
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, styrene oxide, and one product, phenylacetaldehyde.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically a class of other intramolecular oxidoreductases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is styrene-oxide isomerase (epoxide-cleaving). This enzyme is also called SOI. This enzyme participates in styrene degradation.
