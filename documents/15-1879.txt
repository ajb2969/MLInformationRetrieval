Sphingomyelin deacylase

Sphingomyelin deacylase (, SM deacylase, GcSM deacylase, glucosylceramide sphingomyelin deacylase, sphingomyelin glucosylceramide deacylase, SM glucosylceramide GCer deacylase, SM-GCer deacylase, SMGCer deacylase) is an enzyme with system name N-acyl-sphingosylphosphorylcholine amidohydrolase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) an N-acyl-sphingosylphosphorylcholine + H2O 
 
 
 
  a fatty acid + sphingosylphosphorylcholine;;
 
(2) a D-glucosyl-N-acylsphingosine + H2O 
 
 
 
  a fatty acid + D-glucosyl-sphingosine
 

The enzyme is involved in the sphingolipid metabolism in the epidermis.
