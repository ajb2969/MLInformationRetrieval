   Sphingomyelin deacylase      Sphingomyelin deacylase   Sphingomyelin deacylase (, SM deacylase , GcSM deacylase , glucosylceramide sphingomyelin deacylase , sphingomyelin glucosylceramide deacylase , SM glucosylceramide GCer deacylase , SM-GCer deacylase , SMGCer deacylase ) is an enzyme with system name N-acyl-sphingosylphosphorylcholine amidohydrolase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) an N-acyl-sphingosylphosphorylcholine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a fatty acid + sphingosylphosphorylcholine ;;  (2) a D-glucosyl-N-acylsphingosine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a fatty acid + D-glucosyl-sphingosine   The enzyme is involved in the sphingolipid metabolism in the epidermis .
