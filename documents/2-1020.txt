Right quotient

The right quotient (or simply quotient) of a formal language

 
  with a formal language 
 
 
 
  is the language consisting of strings w such that wx is in 
 
 
 
  for some string x in 
 
 
 
 .1 In symbols, we write:



In other words, each string in 
 
 
 
  is the prefix of a string 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , with the remainder of the word being a string in 
 
 
 
 .
Example
Consider



and


 
 .
Now, if we insert a divider into the middle of an element of 
 
 
 
 , the part on the right is in 
 
 
 
  only if the divider is placed adjacent to a b (in which case i ≤ n and j = n) or adjacent to a c (in which case i = 0 and j ≤ n). The part on the left, therefore, will be either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 ; and 
 
 
 
  can be written as



 
 .

Properties
Some common closure properties of the right quotient include:

The quotient of a regular language with any other language is regular.
The quotient of a context free language with a regular language is context free.
The quotient of two context free languages can be any recursively enumerable language.
The quotient of two recursively enumerable languages is recursively enumerable.

Left and right quotients
There is a related notion of left quotient, which keeps the postfixes of 
 
 
 
  without the prefixes in 
 
 
 
 . Sometimes, though, "right quotient" is written simply as "quotient". The above closure properties hold for both left and right quotients.
