8-Hydroxygeraniol dehydrogenase

8-hydroxygeraniol dehydrogenase (, 8-hydroxygeraniol oxidoreductase, CYP76B10, G10H, CrG10H, SmG10H, acyclic monoterpene primary alcohol:NADP+ oxidoreductase) is an enzyme with system name (6E)-8-hydroxygeraniol:NADP+ oxidoreductase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(6E)-8-hydroxygeraniol + 2 NADP+

 
  (6E)-8-oxogeranial + 2 NADPH + 2 H+ (overall reaction)
 
(1a) (6E)-8-hydroxygeraniol + NADP+

 
  (6E)-8-hydroxygeranial + NADPH + H+

(1b) (6E)-8-hydroxygeraniol + NADP+

 
  (6E)-8-oxogeraniol + NADPH + H+

(1c) (6E)-8-hydroxygeranial + NADP+

 
 
  (6E)-8-oxogeranial + NADPH + H+

(1d) (6E)-8-oxogeraniol + NADP+

 
  (6E)-8-oxogeranial + NADPH + H+


This enzyme contains Zn2+. It catalyses the oxidation of (6E)-8-hydroxygeraniol to (6E)-8-oxogeranial via either (6E)-8-hydroxygeranial or (6E)-8-oxogeraniol.
