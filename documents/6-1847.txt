Vector calculus identities

The following identities are important in vector calculus:
Operator notations
Gradient
Gradient of a tensor field, 
 
 
 
 , of order n, is generally written as



and is a tensor field of order . In particular, if the tensor field has order 0 (i.e. a scalar), 
 
 
 
 , the resulting gradient,



is a vector field.
Divergence
The divergence of a tensor field, 
 
 
 
 , of non-zero order n, is generally written as



and is a contraction to a tensor field of order . Specifically, the divergence of a vector is a scalar. The divergence of a higher order tensor field may be found by decomposing the tensor field into a sum of outer products, thereby allowing the use of the identity,



where 
 
 
 
  is the directional derivative in the direction of 
 
 
 
  multiplied by its magnitude. Specifically, for the outer product of two vectors,



Curl
For a 3-dimensional vector field 
 
 
 
 , curl is is also a 3-dimensional vector field, generally written as:



or in Einstein notation as:



where ε is the Levi-Civita symbol.
Laplacian
For a tensor field, 
 
 
 
 , the laplacian is generally written as:



and is a tensor field of the same order.
Special notations
In Feynman subscript notation,



where the notation ∇B means the subscripted gradient operates on only the factor B.12
A less general but similar idea is used in geometric algebra where the so-called Hestenes overdot notation is employed.3 The above identity is then expressed as:



where overdots define the scope of the vector derivative. The dotted vector, in this case B, is differentiated, while the (undotted) A is held constant.
For the remainder of this article, Feynman subscript notation will be used where appropriate.

Product rule for the gradient
The gradient of the product of two scalar fields 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  follows the same form as the product rule in single variable calculus.

 .
Alternatively, using Feynman subscript notation,



As a special case, when

Second derivatives
Curl of the gradient
The curl of the gradient of any scalar field

 
  is always the zero vector:



Divergence of the curl
The divergence of the curl of any vector field A is always zero:



Divergence of the gradient
The Laplacian of a scalar field is defined as the divergence of the gradient:


 
  Note that the result is a scalar quantity.

  Here,∇2 is the vector Laplacian operating on the vector field A.
