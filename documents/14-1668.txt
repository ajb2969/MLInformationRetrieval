   M/G/k queue      M/G/k queue   In queueing theory , a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability , an M/G/k queue is a queue model where arrivals are M arkovian (modulated by a Poisson process ), service times have a G eneral distribution and there are k servers. The model name is written in Kendall's notation , and is an extension of the M/M/c queue , where service times must be exponentially distributed and of the M/G/1 queue with a single server. Most performance metrics for this queueing system are not known and remain an open problem . 1  Model definition  A queue represented by a M/G/ k queue is a stochastic process whose state space is the set {0,1,2,3...}, where the value corresponds to the number of customers in the queue, including any being served. Transitions from state i to i +¬†1 represent the arrival of a new customer: the times between such arrivals have an exponential distribution with parameter Œª. Transitions from state i to i ‚àí¬†1 represent the departure of a customer who has just finished being served: the length of time required for serving an individual customer has a general distribution function. The lengths of times between arrivals and of service periods are random variables which are assumed to be statistically independent .  Steady state distribution  Tijms et al. believe it is "not likely that computationally tractable methods can be developed to compute the exact numerical values of the steady-state probability in the M/G/ k queue." 2  Various approximations for the average queue size, 3 stationary distribution 4 5 and approximation by a reflected Brownian motion 6 7 have been offered by different authors. Recently a new approximate approach based on Laplace transform for steady state probabilities has been proposed by Hamzeh Khazaei et al. . 8 9 This new approach is yet accurate enough in cases of large number of servers and when the distribution of service time has a Coefficient of variation more than one.  Average delay/waiting time  There are numerous approximations for the average delay a job experiences. 10 11 12 13 14 15 The first such was given in 1959 using a factor to adjust the mean waiting time in an M/M/c queue 16 17 This result is sometimes known as Kingman's law of congestion. 18       E   [   W   M/G/  k    ]    =      C  2   +  1   2   ùîº   [   W   M/M/  c    ]          E   delimited-[]   superscript  W    M/G/  k             superscript  C  2   1   2   ùîº   delimited-[]   superscript  W    M/M/  c        E[W^{\text{M/G/}k}]=\frac{C^{2}+1}{2}\mathbb{E}[W^{\text{M/M/}c}]     where C 2 is the coefficient of variation of the service time distribution. Ward Whitt described this approximation as ‚Äúusually an excellent approximation, even given extra information about the service-time distribution." 19  However, it is known that no approximation using only the first two moments can be accurate in all cases. 20  A Markov‚ÄìKrein characterisation has been shown to produce tight bounds on the mean waiting time. 21  Inter-departure times  It is conjectured that the times between departures, given a departure leaves n customers in a queue, has a mean which as n tends to infinity is different from the intuitive 1/ Œº result. 22  Two servers  For an M/G/2 queue (the model with two servers) the problem of determining marginal probabilities can be reduced to solving a pair of integral equations 23 or the Laplace transform of the distribution when the service time distribution is a mixture of exponential distributions. 24 The Laplace transform of queue length 25 and waiting time distributions 26 can be computed when the waiting time distribution has a rational Laplace transform.
