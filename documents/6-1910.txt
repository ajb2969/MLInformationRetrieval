   Jet group      Jet group   In mathematics , a jet group is a generalization of the general linear group which applies to Taylor polynomials instead of vectors at a point. Essentially a jet group describes how a Taylor polynomial transforms under changes of coordinate systems (or, equivalently, diffeomorphisms ).  The k -th order jet group  G n k consists of jets of smooth diffeomorphisms φ: R n → R n such that φ(0)=0. 1  The following is a more precise definition of the jet group.  Let k ≥ 2. The gradient of a function f:  R k → R can be interpreted as a section of the cotangent bundle of R K given by df:  R k → T* R k . Similarly, derivatives of order up to m are sections of the jet bundle J m ( R k ) = R k × W , where       W  =      𝐑  ×    (   𝐑  *   )   k   ×   S  2     (    (   𝐑  *   )   k   )    ×  ⋯  ×   S  m     (    (   𝐑  *   )   k   )     .      W          𝐑   superscript   superscript  𝐑    k    superscript  S  2     superscript   superscript  𝐑    k    normal-⋯   superscript  S  m     superscript   superscript  𝐑    k      W=\mathbf{R}\times(\mathbf{R}^{*})^{k}\times S^{2}((\mathbf{R}^{*})^{k})\times%
 \cdots\times S^{m}((\mathbf{R}^{*})^{k}).     Here R * is the dual vector space to R , and S i denotes the i -th symmetric power . A function f:  R k → R has a prolongation j m f : R k → J m ( R k ) defined at each point p ∈ R k by placing the i -th partials of f at p in the S i (( R *) k ) component of W .  Consider a point    p  =   (  x  ,   x  ′   )   ∈    J  m    (   𝐑  n   )          p   x   superscript  x  normal-′            superscript  J  m    superscript  𝐑  n       p=(x,x^{\prime})\in J^{m}(\mathbf{R}^{n})   . There is a unique polynomial f p in k variables and of order m such that p is in the image of j m f p . That is,      j  k    (   f  p   )    (  x  )    =   x  ′          superscript  j  k    subscript  f  p   x    superscript  x  normal-′     j^{k}(f_{p})(x)=x^{\prime}   . The differential data x′ may be transferred to lie over another point y ∈ R n as j m f p (y) , the partials of f p over y .  Provide J m ( R n ) with a group structure by taking        (  x  ,   x  ′   )   *   (  y  ,   y  ′   )    =   (   x  +  y   ,     j  m    f  p    (  y  )    +   y  ′    )          x   superscript  x  normal-′     y   superscript  y  normal-′        x  y        superscript  j  m    subscript  f  p   y    superscript  y  normal-′       (x,x^{\prime})*(y,y^{\prime})=(x+y,j^{m}f_{p}(y)+y^{\prime})     With this group structure, J m ( R n ) is a Carnot group of class m + 1.  Because of the properties of jets under function composition , G n k is a Lie group . The jet group is a semidirect product of the general linear group and a connected, simply connected nilpotent Lie group . It is also in fact an algebraic group , since the composition involves only polynomial operations.  Notes  References       "  Category:Lie groups     . ↩
