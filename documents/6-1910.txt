Jet group

In mathematics, a jet group is a generalization of the general linear group which applies to Taylor polynomials instead of vectors at a point. Essentially a jet group describes how a Taylor polynomial transforms under changes of coordinate systems (or, equivalently, diffeomorphisms).
The k-th order jet group Gnk consists of jets of smooth diffeomorphisms φ: Rn → Rn such that φ(0)=0.1
The following is a more precise definition of the jet group.
Let k ≥ 2. The gradient of a function f: Rk → R can be interpreted as a section of the cotangent bundle of RK given by df: Rk → T*Rk. Similarly, derivatives of order up to m are sections of the jet bundle Jm(Rk) = Rk × W, where



Here R* is the dual vector space to R, and Si denotes the i-th symmetric power. A function f: Rk → R has a prolongation jmf: Rk → Jm(Rk) defined at each point p ∈ Rk by placing the i-th partials of f at p in the Si((R*)k) component of W.
Consider a point 
 
 
 
 . There is a unique polynomial fp in k variables and of order m such that p is in the image of jmfp. That is, 
 
 
 
 . The differential data x′ may be transferred to lie over another point y ∈ Rn as jmfp(y) , the partials of fp over y.
Provide Jm(Rn) with a group structure by taking



With this group structure, Jm(Rn) is a Carnot group of class m + 1.
Because of the properties of jets under function composition, Gnk is a Lie group. The jet group is a semidirect product of the general linear group and a connected, simply connected nilpotent Lie group. It is also in fact an algebraic group, since the composition involves only polynomial operations.
