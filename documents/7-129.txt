Pépin's test

In mathematics, Pépin's test is a primality test, which can be used to determine whether a Fermat number is prime. It is a variant of Proth's test. The test is named for a French mathematician, Théophile Pépin.
Description of the test
Let 
 
 
 
  be the nth Fermat number. Pépin's test states that for n > 0,


 
  is prime if and only if 
 
 
 
  The expression 
 
 
 
  can be evaluated modulo 
 
 
 
  by repeated squaring. This makes the test a fast polynomial-time algorithm. However, Fermat numbers grow so rapidly that only a handful of Fermat numbers can be tested in a reasonable amount of time and space.
Other bases may be used in place of 3, for example 5, 6, 7, or 10 .
Proof of correctness
Sufficiency: assume that the congruence


 
  holds. Then 
 
 
 
 , thus the multiplicative order of 3 modulo 
 
 
 
  divides 
 
 
 
 , which is a power of two. On the other hand, the order does not divide 
 
 
 
 , and therefore it must be equal to 
 
 
 
 . In particular, there are at least 
 
 
 
  numbers below 
 
 
 
  coprime to 
 
 
 
 , and this can happen only if 
 
 
 
  is prime.
Necessity: assume that 
 
 
 
  is prime. By Euler's criterion,


 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the Legendre symbol. By repeated squaring, we find that 
 
 
 
 , thus 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . As 
 
 
 
 , we conclude 
 
 
 
  from the law of quadratic reciprocity.
Historical Pépin tests
Because of the sparsity of the Fermat numbers, the Pépin test has only been run eight times (on Fermat numbers whose primality statuses were not already known).123 Mayer, Papadopoulos and Crandall speculate that in fact, because of the size of the still undetermined Fermat numbers, it will take decades before technology allows any more Pépin tests to be run.4  the smallest untested Fermat number with no known prime factor is 
 
 
 
  which has 2,585,827,973 digits.
