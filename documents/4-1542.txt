Specific weight

The specific weight (also known as the unit weight) is the weight per unit volume of a material. The symbol of specific weight is γ (the Greek letter Gamma).
A commonly used value is the specific weight of water on Earth at 5°C which is 9.807 kN/m3 or 62.43 lbf/ft3.  National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (2005). Fundamentals of Engineering Supplied-Reference Handbook (7th ed.). Clemson: National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying. ISBN 1-932613-00-5

The terms specific gravity, and less often specific weight, are also used for relative density.
General formula


 
  where


 
  is the specific weight of the material (weight per unit volume, typically N/m3 units)


 
  is the density of the material (mass per unit volume, typically kg/m3)


 
  is acceleration due to gravity (rate of change of velocity, given in m/s2, and on Earth usually given as 9.81 m/s2)
Changes of specific weight
Unlike density, specific weight is not absolute. It depends upon the value of the gravitational acceleration, which varies with location. A significant influence upon the value of specific gravity is the temperature of the material. Pressure may also affect values, depending upon the bulk modulus of the material, but generally, at moderate pressures, has a less significant effect than the other factors. 1
Uses
Fluid mechanics
In fluid mechanics, specific weight represents the force exerted by gravity on a unit volume of a fluid. For this reason, units are expressed as force per unit volume (e.g., N/m3 or lb/ft3). Specific weight can be used as a characteristic property of a fluid. 2
Soil mechanics
Specific weight is often used as a property of soil to solve earthwork problems.
In soil mechanics, specific weight may refer to:

Moist unit weight, which is the unit weight of a soil when void spaces of the soil contain both water and air.



 
  where


 
  is the moist unit weight of the material


 
  is the unit weight of water

w is the moisture content of the material
 
Gs is the specific gravity of the solid
 
e is the void ratio



Dry unit weight, which is the unit weight of a soil when all void spaces of the soil are completely filled with air, with no water.

The formula for dry unit weight is:


 
  where


 
  is the moist unit weight of the material


 
  is the dry unit weight of the material


 
  is the unit weight of water

w is the moisture content of the material
 
Gs is the specific gravity of the solid
 
e is the void ratio



Saturated unit weight, which is the unit weight of a soil when all void spaces of the soil are completely filled with water, with no air.

The formula for saturated unit weight is:


 
  where


 
  is the saturated unit weight of the material


 
  is the unit weight of water

w is the moisture content of the material
 
Gs is the specific gravity of the solid
 
e is the void ratio3



Submerged unit weight, which is defined as the difference between the saturated unit weight and the unit weight of water. 4 It is often used in the calculation of the effective stress in a soil.

The formula for submerged unit weight is:


 
  where


 
  is the submerged unit weight of the material


 
  is the saturated unit weight of the material


 
  is the unit weight of water
Mechanical engineering
Specific weight can be used in mechanical engineering to determine the weight of a structure designed to carry certain loads while remaining intact and remaining within limits regarding deformation.
