   10-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine 10-O-methyltransferase      10-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine 10-O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a 10-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine 10-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 10-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + dihydrochelirubine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 10-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and dihydrochelirubine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:10-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine 10-O-methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis i .
