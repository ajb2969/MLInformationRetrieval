   Cytidylate cyclase      Cytidylate cyclase   In enzymology , a cytidylate cyclase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CTP   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3',5'-cyclic CMP + diphosphate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , CTP , and two products , 3',5'-cyclic CMP and diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the class of phosphorus-oxygen lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CTP diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing; 3',5'-cyclic-CMP-forming) . Other names in common use include 3',5'-cyclic-CMP synthase , cytidylyl cyclase , cytidyl cyclase , and CTP diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing) .
