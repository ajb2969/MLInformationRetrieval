   Pseudoconvexity      Pseudoconvexity   In mathematics , more precisely in the theory of functions of several complex variables , a pseudoconvex set is a special type of open set in the n -dimensional complex space C n . Pseudoconvex sets are important, as they allow for classification of domains of holomorphy .  Let      G  ⊂   ℂ  n       G   superscript  ℂ  n     G\subset{\mathbb{C}}^{n}     be a domain, that is, an open  connected  subset . One says that   G   G   G   is pseudoconvex (or Hartogs pseudoconvex ) if there exists a continuous  plurisubharmonic function    φ   φ   \varphi   on   G   G   G   such that the set      {   z  ∈  G   ∣    φ   (  z  )    <  x   }     conditional-set    z  G       φ  z   x     \{z\in G\mid\varphi(z)     is a relatively compact subset of   G   G   G   for all real numbers     x  .    x   x.   In other words, a domain is pseudoconvex if   G   G   G   has a continuous plurisubharmonic exhaustion function . Every (geometrically) convex set is pseudoconvex.  When   G   G   G   has a    C  2     superscript  C  2    C^{2}   (twice continuously differentiable ) boundary , this notion is the same as Levi pseudoconvexity, which is easier to work with. More specifically, with a    C  2     superscript  C  2    C^{2}   boundary, it can be shown that   G   G   G   has a defining function; i.e., that there exists    ρ  :    ℂ  n   →  ℝ      normal-:  ρ   normal-→   superscript  ℂ  n   ℝ     \rho:\mathbb{C}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}   which is    C  2     superscript  C  2    C^{2}   so that    G  =   {  ρ  <  0  }      fragments  G    fragments  normal-{  ρ   0  normal-}     G=\{\rho<0\}   , and    ∂  G  =   {  ρ  =  0  }      fragments   G    fragments  normal-{  ρ   0  normal-}     \partial G=\{\rho=0\}   . Now,   G   G   G   is pseudoconvex iff for every    p  ∈   ∂  G       p    G     p\in\partial G   and   w   w   w   in the complex tangent space at p that is,        ∇  ρ    (  p  )   w   =    ∑   i  =  1   n       ∂  ρ    (  p  )     ∂   z  j      w  j     =  0           normal-∇  ρ   p  w     superscript   subscript     i  1    n           ρ   p      subscript  z  j      subscript  w  j          0     \nabla\rho(p)w=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\partial\rho(p)}{\partial z_{j}}w_{j}=0   we have        ∑    i  ,  j   =  1   n        ∂  2   ρ    (  p  )      ∂   z  i     ∂    z  j   ¯       w  i     w  j   ¯     ≥  0.        superscript   subscript      i  j   1    n           superscript   2   ρ   p        subscript  z  i       normal-¯   subscript  z  j        subscript  w  i    normal-¯   subscript  w  j      0.    \sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\frac{\partial^{2}\rho(p)}{\partial z_{i}\partial\bar{z_{j}}}w%
 _{i}\bar{w_{j}}\geq 0.     If   G   G   G   does not have a    C  2     superscript  C  2    C^{2}   boundary, the following approximation result can come in useful.  Proposition 1  If   G   G   G   is pseudoconvex, then there exist bounded , strongly Levi pseudoconvex domains     G  k   ⊂  G       subscript  G  k   G    G_{k}\subset G   with    C  ∞     superscript  C     C^{\infty}   ( smooth ) boundary which are relatively compact in   G   G   G   , such that       G  =    ⋃   k  =  1   ∞    G  k     .      G    superscript   subscript     k  1       subscript  G  k      G=\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}G_{k}.     This is because once we have a   φ   φ   \varphi   as in the definition we can actually find a C ∞ exhaustion function.  ==The case n = 1== In one complex dimension, every open domain is pseudoconvex. The concept of pseudoconvexity is thus more useful in dimensions higher than 1.
