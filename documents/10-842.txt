   Thioether S-methyltransferase      Thioether S-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a thioether S-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + dimethyl sulfide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + trimethylsulfonium   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and dimethyl sulfide , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and trimethylsulfonium .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:dimethyl-sulfide S-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include S-adenosyl-L-methionine:thioether S-methyltransferase , and thioether methyltransferase .
