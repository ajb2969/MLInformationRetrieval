   Partition of an interval      Partition of an interval   (Figure)  A partition of an interval being used in a Riemann sum . The partition itself is shown in grey at the bottom, with one subinterval indicated in red.   In mathematics , a partition of an interval [ a , b ] on the real line is a finite sequence  x = ( x i ) of real numbers such that   a = x 0 1 2 n = b .   In other terms, a partition of a compact interval I is a strictly increasing sequence of numbers (belonging to the interval I itself) starting from the initial point of I and arriving at the final point of I .  Every interval of the form [ x i , x i+1 ] is referred to as a sub-interval of the partition x .  Refinement of a partition  Another partition of the given interval, Q , is defined as a refinement of the partition , P , when it contains all the points of P and possibly some other points as well; the partition Q is said to be “finer” than P . Given two partitions, P and Q , one can always form their common refinement , denoted P ∨ Q , which consists of all the points of P and Q , re-numbered in order. 1  Norm of a partition  The norm (or mesh ) of the partition   x 0 1 2 n    is the length of the longest of these subintervals, 2 3 that is   max{ | x i − x i −1 | : i = 1, ..., n }.   Applications  Partitions are used in the theory of the Riemann integral , the Riemann–Stieltjes integral and the regulated integral . Specifically, as finer partitions of a given interval are considered, their mesh approaches zero and the Riemann sum based on a given partition approaches the Riemann integral . 4  Tagged partitions  A tagged partition 5 is a partition of a given interval together with a finite sequence of numbers t 0 , ..., t n −1 subject to the conditions that for each i ,   x i ≤ t i ≤ x i+1 .   In other words, a tagged partition is a partition together with a distinguished point of every subinterval: its mesh is defined in the same way as for an ordinary partition. It is possible to define a partial order on the set of all tagged partitions by saying that one tagged partition is bigger than another if the bigger one is a refinement of the smaller one.  Suppose that     x  0   ,  …  ,   x  n       subscript  x  0   normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{0},\ldots,x_{n}   together with     t  0   ,  …  ,   t   n  -  1        subscript  t  0   normal-…   subscript  t    n  1      t_{0},\ldots,t_{n-1}   is a tagged partition of    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   , and that     y  0   ,  …  ,   y  m       subscript  y  0   normal-…   subscript  y  m     y_{0},\ldots,y_{m}   together with     s  0   ,  …  ,   s   m  -  1        subscript  s  0   normal-…   subscript  s    m  1      s_{0},\ldots,s_{m-1}   is another tagged partition of    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   . We say that     y  0   ,  …  ,   y  m       subscript  y  0   normal-…   subscript  y  m     y_{0},\ldots,y_{m}   and     s  0   ,  …  ,   s   m  -  1        subscript  s  0   normal-…   subscript  s    m  1      s_{0},\ldots,s_{m-1}   together is a refinement of a tagged partition      x  0   ,  …  ,   x  n       subscript  x  0   normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{0},\ldots,x_{n}   together with     t  0   ,  …  ,   t   n  -  1        subscript  t  0   normal-…   subscript  t    n  1      t_{0},\ldots,t_{n-1}   if for each integer   i   i   i   with    0  ≤  i  ≤  n        0  i       n     0\leq i\leq n   , there is an integer    r   (  i  )       r  i    r(i)   such that     x  i   =   y   r   (  i  )          subscript  x  i    subscript  y    r  i      x_{i}=y_{r(i)}   and such that     t  i   =   s  j        subscript  t  i    subscript  s  j     t_{i}=s_{j}   for some   j   j   j   with     r   (  i  )    ≤  j  ≤    r   (   i  +  1   )    -  1           r  i   j           r    i  1    1      r(i)\leq j\leq r(i+1)-1   . Said more simply, a refinement of a tagged partition takes the starting partition and adds more tags, but does not take any away.
