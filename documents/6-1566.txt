   Einstein relation (kinetic theory)      Einstein relation (kinetic theory)   In physics (specifically, in kinetic theory ) the Einstein relation (also known as Einstein–Smoluchowski relation 1 ) is a previously unexpected connection revealed independently by William Sutherland in 1905, 2 3  Albert Einstein in 1905, 4 and by Marian Smoluchowski in 1906 5 in their papers on Brownian motion . The more general form of the equation is 6      D  =    μ    k  B   T       D    μ   subscript  k  B   T     D=\mu\,k_{B}T   where   D is the diffusion constant ;  μ is the "mobility", or the ratio of the particle's terminal drift velocity to an applied force , μ = v d / F ;  k B is Boltzmann's constant ;  T is the absolute temperature .   This equation is an early example of a fluctuation-dissipation relation . 7  Two frequently used important special forms of the relation are:      D  =      μ  q     k  B   T   q       D       subscript  μ  q    subscript  k  B   T   q     D={{\mu_{q}\,k_{B}T}\over{q}}   ( Electrical mobility equation , for diffusion of charged particles 8 )      D  =     k  B   T    6   π    η   r        D       subscript  k  B   T     6  π  η  r      D=\frac{k_{B}T}{6\pi\,\eta\,r}   (" Stokes–Einstein–Sutherland equation ", 9 for diffusion of spherical particles through a liquid with low Reynolds number )  where   q is the electrical charge of a particle;  μ q , the electrical mobility of the charged particle;  η is the dynamic viscosity ;  r is the radius of the spherical particle.   Special cases  Electrical mobility equation  For a particle with electrical charge  q , its electrical mobility  μ q is related to its generalized mobility μ by the equation μ=μ q /q . The parameter μ q is the ratio of the particle's terminal drift velocity to an applied electric field . Hence, the equation in the case of a charged particle is given as      D  =      μ  q     k  B   T   q       D       subscript  μ  q    subscript  k  B   T   q     D=\frac{\mu_{q}\,k_{B}T}{q}     Stokes-Einstein equation  In the limit of low Reynolds number , the mobility μ is the inverse of the drag coefficient   ζ   ζ   \zeta   . A damping constant    γ  =   ζ  /  m       γ    ζ  m     \gamma=\zeta/m   is frequently used for the momentum relaxation time (time needed for the inertia momentum to become negligible compared to the random momenta) of the diffusive object. For spherical particles of radius r , Stokes' law gives       ζ  =   6   π    η   r    ,      ζ    6  π  η  r     \zeta=6\pi\,\eta\,r,     where   η   η   \eta   is the viscosity of the medium. Thus the Einstein-Smoluchowski relation results into the Stokes-Einstein relation      D  =     k  B   T    6   π    η   r        D       subscript  k  normal-B   T     6  π  η  r      D=\frac{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}{6\pi\,\eta\,r}     In the case of Rotational diffusion , the friction is     ζ  r   =   8  π  η   r  3         subscript  ζ  normal-r     8  π  η   superscript  r  3      \zeta_{\mathrm{r}}=8\pi\eta r^{3}   , and the rotational diffusion constant    D  r     subscript  D  normal-r    D_{\mathrm{r}}   is       D  r   =     k  B   T    8   π    η    r  3          subscript  D  normal-r        subscript  k  normal-B   T     8  π  η   superscript  r  3       D_{\mathrm{r}}=\frac{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}{8\pi\,\eta\,r^{3}}     Semiconductor  In a semiconductor with an arbitrary density of states the Einstein relation is: 10 11      D  =      μ  q    p    q    d  p    d  η      =    μ  p   p    ∂  V    ∂  p     =    μ  p      k  B   T   q          D       subscript  μ  q   p     q      d  p     d  η              subscript  μ  p   p      V     p             subscript  μ  p        subscript  k  B   T   q       D=\frac{\mu_{q}\,p}{q\frac{dp}{d\eta}}=\mu_{p}p\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}=%
 \mu_{p}\frac{k_{B}T}{q}     where   μ   μ   \mu   is the mobility , p the particle concentration, V the electrostatic potential (volt), T the temperature (K),    k  B     subscript  k  B    k_{B}   Boltzmann constant, q the charge (C).  Proof of general case  This is a proof in one dimension, but it is identical to a proof in two or three dimensions (just replace d/dx with   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   ). Essentially the same proof is found in many places, for example see Kubo. 12  Suppose some fixed, external potential energy  U creates a force on the particle    F  =   -     d  U   /  d   x        F          d  U   d   x      F=-dU/dx   (for example, an electric force). We assume that the particle would respond, other things being equal, by moving with velocity    v  =   μ  F       v    μ  F     v=\mu F   . Now assume that there are a large number of such particles, with local concentration    ρ   (  x  )       ρ  x    \rho(x)   as a function of position. After some time, equilibrium will be established: the particles will "pile up" around the areas with lowest U , but will still be spread out to some extent because of random diffusion. At this point, there is no net flow of particles: the tendency of particles to get pulled towards lower U (called the "drift current") is equal and opposite the tendency of particles to spread out due to diffusion (called the "diffusion current"). (See drift-diffusion equation .)  The net flow of particles due to the drift current alone is        J  drift    (  x  )    =    μ   F   (  x  )   ρ   (  x  )    =   -   ρ   (  x  )   μ    d  U    d  x               subscript  J  drift   x     μ  F  x  ρ  x            ρ  x  μ      d  U     d  x         J_{\mathrm{drift}}(x)=\mu\,F(x)\,\rho(x)=-\rho(x)\mu\frac{dU}{dx}     (i.e. the number of particles flowing past a point is the particle concentration times the average velocity).  The net flow of particles due to the diffusion current alone is, by Fick's laws        J  diffusion    (  x  )    =   -   D    d  ρ    d  x             subscript  J  diffusion   x       D      d  ρ     d  x        J_{\mathrm{diffusion}}(x)=-D\frac{d\rho}{dx}     (the minus sign means that particles flow from higher concentration to lower).  Equilibrium requires:      0  =    J  drift   +   J  diffusion    =    -   ρ   (  x  )   μ    d  U    d  x      -   D    d  ρ    d  x            0     subscript  J  drift    subscript  J  diffusion               ρ  x  μ      d  U     d  x        D      d  ρ     d  x         0=J_{\mathrm{drift}}+J_{\mathrm{diffusion}}=-\rho(x)\mu\frac{dU}{dx}-D\frac{d%
 \rho}{dx}     On the other hand, in equilibrium, we can apply thermodynamics, in particular Boltzmann statistics , to infer that       ρ   (  x  )    =   A   e   -   U  /   (    k  B   T   )             ρ  x     A   superscript  e      U     subscript  k  B   T         \rho(x)=Ae^{-U/(k_{B}T)}     where A is some constant related to the total number of particles. Therefore, by the chain rule ,         d  ρ    d  x    =   -    1    k  B   T      d  U    d  x    ρ   (  x  )      .          d  ρ     d  x          1     subscript  k  B   T        d  U     d  x    ρ  x      \frac{d\rho}{dx}=-\frac{1}{k_{B}T}\frac{dU}{dx}\rho(x).     Finally, plugging this in:      0  =    J  drift   +   J  diffusion    =    -   ρ   (  x  )   μ    d  U    d  x      +    D    k  B   T      d  U    d  x    ρ   (  x  )     =   -   ρ   (  x  )     d  U    d  x     (   μ  -   D    k  B   T     )           0     subscript  J  drift    subscript  J  diffusion               ρ  x  μ      d  U     d  x          D     subscript  k  B   T        d  U     d  x    ρ  x             ρ  x      d  U     d  x      μ    D     subscript  k  B   T          0=J_{\mathrm{drift}}+J_{\mathrm{diffusion}}=-\rho(x)\mu\frac{dU}{dx}+\frac{D}{%
 k_{B}T}\frac{dU}{dx}\rho(x)=-\rho(x)\frac{dU}{dx}\left(\mu-\frac{D}{k_{B}T}\right)     Since this equation must hold everywhere,       μ  =   D    k  B   T     .      μ    D     subscript  k  B   T      \mu=\frac{D}{k_{B}T}.
