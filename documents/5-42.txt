Abstract polytope




Abstract polytope

 In mathematics, an abstract polytope, informally speaking, is a structure which considers only the combinatorial properties of a traditional polytope, ignoring many of its other properties, such as angles, edge lengths, etc. No space, such as Euclidean space, is required to contain it. The abstract formulation embodies the combinatorial properties as a partially ordered set or poset.
The abstract definition allows some more general combinatorial structures than the traditional concept of a polytope, and allows many new objects that have no counterpart in traditional theory.
The term polytope is a generalisation of polygons and polyhedra into any number of dimensions.
Traditional versus abstract polytopes
In Euclidean geometry, the six quadrilaterals above are all different. Yet they have something in common that is not shared by a triangle or a cube, for example.
The elegant, but geographically inaccurate, London Tube map provides all the relevant information to go from A to B. An even better example is an electrical circuit diagram or schematic; the final layout of wires and parts is often unrecognisable at first glance.
In each of these examples, the connections between elements are the same, regardless of the physical layout. The objects are said to be combinatorially equivalent. This equivalence is what is encapsulated in the concept of an abstract polytope. So, combinatorially, our six quadrilaterals are all the “same”. More rigorously, they are said to be isomorphic or “structure preserving”.
Properties, particularly measurable ones, of traditional polytopes such as angles, edge-lengths, skewness, and convexity have no meaning for an abstract polytope. Other traditional concepts may carry over, but not always identically. Care must be exercised, for what is true for traditional polytopes may not be so for abstract ones, and vice versa. For example, a traditional polytope is regular if all its facets and vertex figures are regular, but this is not so for abstract polytopes.1
Introductory concepts
To define an abstract polytope, a few preliminary concepts are needed.
Throughout this article, polytope means abstract polytope - unless stated otherwise. The term traditional will be used, somewhat loosely, to refer to what is generally understood by polytope, excluding our abstract polytopes. Some authors also use the terms classical or geometric.
Polytopes as posets
The connections on a railway map or electrical circuit can be represented quite satisfactorily with just “dots and lines” - i.e. a graph. Polytopes, however, have a dimensional hierarchy. For example, the vertices, edges and faces of a cube have dimension 0, 1, and 2 respectively; the cube itself is 3-dimensional.
In our abstract theory, the concept of rank replaces that of dimension; we formally define it below.
We use the term face to refer to an element of any rank, e.g. vertices (rank 0) or edges (rank 1), and not just faces of rank 2. An element of rank k is called a k-face.
We shall define a polytope, then, as a set of faces P with an order relation '''−1. If this seems strange at first, the feeling is quickly dispelled on seeing the elegant symmetry which this concept brings to our theory. (Historically, mathematicians resisted such commonplace concepts as negative, fractional, irrational and complex numbers - and even zero!)
A simple example
As an example, we now create an abstract square, which has faces as in the table below:

 The rank of a face or polytope usually corresponds to the dimension of its counterpart in traditional theory - but not always. For example, a face of rank 1 corresponds to an edge, which is 1-dimensional. But a skew polygon in traditional geometry is 3-dimensional, since it is not flat (planar); while its abstract equivalent, and indeed all abstract polygons, have rank 2.
For some ranks, we have names for their face-types, as in the table.

† Although traditionally "face" has meant a rank 2 face, we shall always write "2-face" to avoid ambiguity, reserving the term "face" to mean a face of any rank.
The line segment
 A line segment is a poset that has a least face, precisely two 0-faces, and a greatest face, for example {ø, a, b, ab}. It follows easily that the vertices a and b have rank 0, and that the greatest face ab, and therefore the poset, both have rank 1. This lends credibility to the definition of rank.
Flags
A flag is a maximal chain of faces, i.e. a (totally) ordered set Ψ of faces, each a subface of the next (if any), and such that Ψ is not a subset of any larger chain.
For example, {ø, a, ab, abc} is a flag in the triangle abc.
We shall additionally require that, for a given polytope, all flags contain the same number of faces. Posets do not, in general, satisfy this requirement; the poset {ø, a, b, bc, abc} has 2 flags of unequal size, and is not therefore a polytope.
Clearly, given any two distinct faces F, G in a flag, either F  G.

Any subset P' of a poset P is a poset (with the same relation n/V, where Fn is the greatest face.
For example, in the triangle abc, the vertex figure at b, abc/b, is {b, ab, bc, abc}, which is a line segment. The vertex figures of a cube are triangles.
Connectedness
A poset P is connected if P has rank ≤ 1, or, given any two proper faces F and G, there is a sequence of proper faces

H1, H2, ... ,Hk


such that F = H1, G = Hk, and each Hi, i \infty, we have the (abstract equivalent of) the traditional polygon with p vertices and p edges, or a p-gon. For p = 3, 4, 5, ... we have the triangle, square, pentagon, ....
For p = 2, we have the digon, and p = 
 
 
 
  we get the apeirogon.
The digon
 A digon, as its name implies, is a polygon of 2 edges. Unlike any other polygon, both edges have the same two vertices. For this reason, it is regarded as degenerate.
Until now, we have defined face sets using "vertex notation" - e.g. {ø, a, b, c, ab, ac, bc, abc} for the triangle abc. This method has the decided advantage of implying the '(i''), then this defines a collection of maps on the polytopes flags, say φi. These maps are called exchange maps, since they swap pairs of flags : (Ψφi)φi = Ψ always. Some other properties of the exchange maps :

φi2 is the identity map
The φi generate a group. (The action of this group on the flags of the polytope is an example of what is called the flag action of the group on the polytope)
If |i − j| > 1, φiφj = φjφi
If α is an automorphism of the polytope, then αφi = φiα
If the polytope is regular, the group generated by the φi is isomorphic to the automorphism group, otherwise, it is strictly larger.

The exchange maps and the flag action in particular can be used to prove that any abstract polytope is a quotient of some regular polytope.
Incidence matrices
A polytope can also be represented by tabulating its incidences. The following incidence matrix is that of a triangle:

The table shows a dot wherever a face is a subface of another, or vice versa (so the table is symmetric about the diagonal)- so in fact, the table has redundant information; it would suffice to show only a dot when the row face ≤ the column face.
Since both the body and the empty set are incident with all other elements, the first row and column as well as the last row and column are trivial and can conveniently be omitted.
Further information is gained by counting each occurrence of an incidence as 1 (and hence non-incidence as 0). This numerative usage enables a symmetry grouping, as in the Hasse Diagram of the square pyramid: If vertices B, C, D, and E are considered symmetrically equivalent within the abstract polytope, then edges f, g, h, and j will be grouped together, and also edges k, l, m, and n, And finally also the triangles 'P', 'Q', 'R', and 'S'. Thus the corresponding incidence matrix of this abstract polytope may be shown as:





  A  

B,C,D,E

f,g,h,j

P,Q,R,S

In this accumulated incidence matrix representation the diagonal entries represent the total counts of either element type.
Elements of different type of the same rank clearly are never incident so the value will always be 0, however to help distinguish such relationships, an asterisk (*) is used instead of 0.
The sub-diagonal entries of each row represent the incidence counts of the relevant sub-elements, while the super-diagonal entries represent the respective element counts of the vertex-, edge- or whatever -figure.
Already this simple square pyramid shows that the symmetry-accumulated incidence matrices are no longer symmetrical. But there is still a simple entity-relation (beside the generalised Euler formulae for the diagonal, respectively the sub-diagonal entities of each row, respectively the super-diagonal elements of each row - those at least whenever no holes or stars etc. are considered), as for any such incidence matrix

 == History ==
 An early example of abstract polytopes was the discovery by [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|Coxeter]] and [[John Flinders Petrie|Petrie]] of the three infinite structures {4, 6}, {6, 4} and {6, 6}, which they called [[regular skew apeirohedron|regular skew apeirohedra]].
 
 In the 1960s [[Branko Grünbaum]] issued a call to the geometric community to consider generalizations of the concept of [[regular polytope]]s that he called ''polystromata''. He developed a theory of polystromata, showing examples of new objects including the [[11-cell]].
 
 The [[11-cell]] is a [[Dual polytope|self-dual]] [[4-polytope]] whose [[Facet (geometry)|facets]] are not [[Icosahedron|icosahedra]], but are "[[hemi-icosahedron|hemi-icosahedra]]" — that is, they are the shape one gets if one considers opposite faces of the icosahedra to be actually the ''same'' face (Grünbaum, 1977). A few years after Grünbaum's discovery of the [[11-cell]], [[H.S.M. Coxeter]] discovered a similar polytope, the [[57-cell]] (Coxeter 1982, 1984), and then independently rediscovered the 11-cell.
 
 [[Egon Schulte]] defined "regular incidence complexes" and "regular incidence polytopes" in his PhD dissertation in the 1980s - the first time the modern definition was introduced. Subsequently, he and [[Peter McMullen]] developed the basics of the theory in a series of research articles that were later collected into a book. Numerous other researchers have since made their own contributions, and the early pioneers (including Grünbaum) had also accepted Schulte's definition as the "correct" one.
