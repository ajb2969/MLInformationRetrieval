   Sabinene-hydrate synthase      Sabinene-hydrate synthase   In enzymology , a sabinene-hydrate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   geranyl diphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   sabinene hydrate + diphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are geranyl diphosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are sabinene hydrate and diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, sabinene-hydrate-forming) . This enzyme is also called sabinene hydrate cyclase . This enzyme participates in monoterpenoid biosynthesis .  References      "  Category:EC 4.2.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
