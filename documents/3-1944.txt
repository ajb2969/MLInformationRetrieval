   Tolerant sequence      Tolerant sequence   In mathematical logic , a tolerant sequence is a sequence      T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   ,...,    T  n     subscript  T  n    T_{n}     of formal theories such that there are consistent  extensions      S  1     subscript  S  1    S_{1}   ,...,    S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}     of these theories with each    S   i  +  1      subscript  S    i  1     S_{i+1}    interpretable in    S  i     subscript  S  i    S_{i}   . Tolerance naturally generalizes from sequences of theories to trees of theories. Weak interpretability can be shown to be a special, binary case of tolerance.  This concept, together with its dual concept of cotolerance , was introduced by Japaridze in 1992, who also proved that, for Peano arithmetic and any stronger theories with effective axiomatizations, tolerance is equivalent to    Π  1     subscript  normal-Π  1    \Pi_{1}   -consistency.
