   DBAR problem      DBAR problem   The DBAR problem is the problem of solving the differential equation          ∂  ¯   f   (  z  ,   z  ¯   )    =   g   (  z  )           normal-¯    f   z   normal-¯  z       g  z     \bar{\partial}f(z,\bar{z})=g(z)        for the function    f   (  z  ,   z  ¯   )       f   z   normal-¯  z      f(z,\bar{z})   , where    g   (  z  )       g  z    g(z)   is assumed to be known and    z  =   x  +   i  y        z    x    i  y      z=x+iy   is a complex number in a domain     R  ⊆  ℂ      R  ℂ    R\subseteq\mathbb{C}   . The operator    ∂  ¯     normal-¯     \bar{\partial}   is called the DBAR operator         ∂  ¯   =    1  2    (    ∂   ∂  x    +   i   ∂   ∂  y      )         normal-¯        1  2          x      i       y         \bar{\partial}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+i\frac{\partial}{%
 \partial y}\right)        The DBAR operator is nothing other than the complex conjugate of the operator        ∂  =   ∂   ∂  z    =    1  2    (    ∂   ∂  x    -   i   ∂   ∂  y      )                z             1  2          x      i       y          \partial=\frac{\partial}{\partial z}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial
 x%
 }-i\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)        denoting the usual differentiation in the complex   z   z   z   -plane.  The DBAR problem is of key importance in the theory of integrable systems 1 and generalizes the Riemann–Hilbert problem .  References  "  DBAR problem     ↩
