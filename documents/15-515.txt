DBAR problem

The DBAR problem is the problem of solving the differential equation








for the function 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is assumed to be known and 
 
 
 
 
  is a complex number in a domain

 
 . The operator 
 
 
 
  is called the DBAR operator








The DBAR operator is nothing other than the complex conjugate of the operator








denoting the usual differentiation in the complex 
 
 
 
 
 -plane.
The DBAR problem is of key importance in the theory of integrable systems1 and generalizes the Riemann–Hilbert problem.
