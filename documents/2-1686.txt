   Absorption law      Absorption law   In algebra , the absorption law or absorption identity is an identity linking a pair of binary operations .  Two binary operations, ¤ and ⁂, are said to be connected by the absorption law if:   a ¤ ( a ⁂ b ) = a ⁂ ( a ¤ b ) = a .   A set equipped with two commutative , associative and idempotent binary operations   ∨     \scriptstyle\lor   ("join") and   ∧     \scriptstyle\land   ("meet") that are connected by the absorption law is called a lattice .  Examples of lattices include Boolean algebras , the set of sets with union and intersection operators, Heyting algebras , and ordered sets with min and max operations.  In classical logic , and in particular Boolean algebra , the operations OR and AND , which are also denoted by   ∨     \scriptstyle\lor   and   ∧     \scriptstyle\land   , satisfy the lattice axioms, including the absorption law. The same is true for intuitionistic logic .  The absorption law does not hold in many other algebraic structures, such as commutative rings , e.g. the field of real numbers , relevance logics , linear logics , and substructural logics . In the last case, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the free variables of the defining pair of identities.
