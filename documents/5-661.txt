   Fixed-point space      Fixed-point space   In mathematics , a Hausdorff space  X is called a fixed-point space if every continuous function     f  :   X  →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  X     f:X\rightarrow X   has a fixed point .  For example, any closed interval [a,b] in   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   is a fixed point space, and it can be proved from the intermediate value property of real continuous function. The open interval ( a , b ), however, is not a fixed point space. To see it, consider the function     f   (  x  )    =   a  +    1   b  -  a    ⋅    (   x  -  a   )   2           f  x     a   normal-⋅    1    b  a     superscript    x  a   2       f(x)=a+\frac{1}{b-a}\cdot(x-a)^{2}   , for example.  Any linearly ordered space that is connected and has a top and a bottom element is a fixed point space.  Note that, in the definition, we could easily have disposed of the condition that the space is Hausdorff.  References   Vasile I. Istratescu, Fixed Point Theory, An Introduction , D.
