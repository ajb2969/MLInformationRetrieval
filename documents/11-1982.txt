   Log-linear model      Log-linear model   A log-linear model is a mathematical model that takes the form of a function whose logarithm is a linear combination of the parameters of the model, which makes it possible to apply (possibly multivariate ) linear regression . That is, it has the general form       exp   (   c  +    ∑  i     w  i    f  i    (  X  )      )    ,        c    subscript   i      subscript  w  i    subscript  f  i   X       \exp\left(c+\sum_{i}w_{i}f_{i}(X)\right)\,,   in which the are quantities that are functions of the variables   X   X   X   , in general a vector of values, while   c   c   c   and the stand for the model parameters.  The term may specifically be used for:   A log-linear plot or graph, which is a type of semi-log plot .  Poisson regression for contingency tables, a type of generalized linear model .   The specific applications of log-linear models are where the output quantity lies in the range 0 to ∞, for values of the independent variables   X   X   X   , or more immediately, the transformed quantities in the range −∞ to +∞. This may be contrasted to logistic models, similar to the logistic function , for which the output quantity lies in the range 0 to 1. Thus the contexts where these models are useful or realistic often depends on the range of the values being modelled.
