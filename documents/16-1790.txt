   Relic abundance      Relic abundance   In cosmology, (temperature scaled) abundance of a particle is defined by       Y  ≡   n  /   T  3     ,      Y    n   superscript  T  3      Y\equiv n/T^{3},   , 1  where   n   n   n   is the number density:      n  ≡   N  /  V       n    N  V     n\equiv N/V   ,  that is, number of particles per physical volume (not the comoving volume).  The relic abundance of a particle is shown by    Y  ∞     subscript  Y     Y_{\infty}   indicates the asymptotic value of abundance of a species of a particle which it will reach after its freaz out .  The current accepted abundance values for protons, neutrons, photons, neutrinos, and WIMPs can be found in the table bellow (which hopefully will be created by a knowledgeable and kind editor).
