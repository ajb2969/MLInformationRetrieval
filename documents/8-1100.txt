   Helly's selection theorem      Helly's selection theorem   In mathematics , Helly's selection theorem states that a sequence of functions that is locally of bounded total variation and uniformly bounded at a point has a convergent  subsequence . In other words, it is a compactness theorem for the space BV loc . It is named for the Austrian  mathematician  Eduard Helly .  The theorem has applications throughout mathematical analysis . In probability theory , the result implies compactness of a tight family of measures .  Statement of the theorem  Let U be an open subset of the real line and let f n : U → R , n ∈ N , be a sequence of functions. Suppose that   ( f n ) has uniformly bounded  total variation on any W that is compactly embedded in U . That is, for all sets W ⊆ U with compact  closure  W̄ ⊆ U ,            sup   n  ∈  ℕ     (     ∥   f  n   ∥     L  1    (  W  )     +    ∥    d   f  n     d  t    ∥     L  1    (  W  )      )    <   +  ∞    ,        subscript  supremum    n  ℕ       subscript   norm   subscript  f  n       superscript  L  1   W     subscript   norm      normal-d   subscript  f  n      normal-d  t        superscript  L  1   W            \sup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\left(\left\|f_{n}\right\|_{L^{1}(W)}+\left\|\frac{%
 \mathrm{d}f_{n}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right\|_{L^{1}(W)}\right)<+\infty,       where the derivative is taken in the sense of tempered distributions ;    and ( f n ) is uniformly bounded at a point. That is, for some t ∈ U , { f n ( t ) | n ∈ N } ⊆ R is a bounded set .   Then there exists a subsequence  f n k , k ∈ N , of f n and a function f : U → R , locally of bounded variation , such that   f n k converges to f pointwise;  and f n k converges to f locally in L 1 (see locally integrable function ), i.e., for all W compactly embedded in U ,            lim   k  →  ∞      ∫  W     |     f   n  k     (  x  )    -   f   (  x  )     |   d  x     =  0   ;        subscript    normal-→  k       subscript   W            subscript  f   subscript  n  k    x     f  x     normal-d  x     0    \lim_{k\to\infty}\int_{W}\big|f_{n_{k}}(x)-f(x)\big|\,\mathrm{d}x=0;         and, for W compactly embedded in U ,            ∥    d  f    d  t    ∥     L  1    (  W  )     ≤    lim inf   k  →  ∞      ∥    d   f   n  k      d  t    ∥     L  1    (  W  )       .       subscript   norm      normal-d  f     normal-d  t        superscript  L  1   W      subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  k      subscript   norm      normal-d   subscript  f   subscript  n  k       normal-d  t        superscript  L  1   W       \left\|\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}t}\right\|_{L^{1}(W)}\leq\liminf_{k\to%
 \infty}\left\|\frac{\mathrm{d}f_{n_{k}}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right\|_{L^{1}(W)}.        Generalizations  There are many generalizations and refinements of Helly's theorem. The following theorem, for BV functions taking values in Banach spaces , is due to Barbu and Precupanu:  Let X be a reflexive , separable Hilbert space and let E be a closed, convex subset of X . Let Δ : X → [0, +∞) be positive-definite and homogeneous of degree one . Suppose that z n is a uniformly bounded sequence in BV([0, T ]; X ) with z n ( t ) ∈ E for all n ∈ N and t ∈ [0, T ]. Then there exists a subsequence z n k and functions δ , z ∈ BV([0, T ]; X ) such that   for all t ∈ [0, T ],            ∫   [  0  ,  t  )     Δ   (   d   z   n  k     )     →   δ   (  t  )     ;     normal-→    subscript    0  t      normal-Δ    normal-d   subscript  z   subscript  n  k         δ  t     \int_{[0,t)}\Delta(\mathrm{d}z_{n_{k}})\to\delta(t);         and, for all t ∈ [0, T ],            z   n  k     (  t  )    ⇀   z   (  t  )    ∈  E   ;       normal-⇀     subscript  z   subscript  n  k    t     z  t        E     z_{n_{k}}(t)\rightharpoonup z(t)\in E;         and, for all 0 ≤ s < t ≤ T ,            ∫   [  s  ,  t  )     Δ   (   d  z   )     ≤    δ   (  t  )    -   δ   (  s  )      .        subscript    s  t      normal-Δ    normal-d  z         δ  t     δ  s      \int_{[s,t)}\Delta(\mathrm{d}z)\leq\delta(t)-\delta(s).
