Quadric (projective geometry)

In projective geometry, a quadric is the set of points of a projective space where a certain quadratic form on the homogeneous coordinates becomes zero. We shall restrict ourself to the case of finite-dimensional projective spaces.
Quadratic forms
Let be 
 
 
 
  a field and 
 
 
 
  a vector space over 
 
 
 
 . A mapping 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  such that

  for any 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
 


(Q2)

 
 
  is a bilinear form.
 

is called quadratic form. The bilinear form 
 
 
 
  is symmetric.
In case of 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are mutually determined in a unique way.
 In case of 
 
 
 
  we have always

  is symplectic.

Definition and properties of a quadric
Below let 
 
 
 
  be a field, 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  the 
 
 
 
 
 -dimensional projective space over 
 
 
 
 , i.e.



the set of points. (
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -dimensional vector space over the field 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the 1-dimensional subspace generated by 
 
 
),



the set of lines.
Additionally let be 
 
 
 
  a quadratic form on vector space 
 
 
 
 
 . A point 
 
 
 
  is called singular if 
 
 
 
 . The set



of singular points of 
 
 
 
  is called quadric (with respect to the quadratic form 
 
 
 
 
 ). For point 
 
 
 
  the set



is called polar space of 
 
 
 
  (with respect to 
 
 
 
 ). Obviously 
 
 
 
 
  is either a hyperplane or 
 
 
 
 .
For the considerations below we assume
 
 
 
 .
Example: For 
 
 
 
  we get a conic in 
 
 
 
 .
For the intersection of a line with a quadric 
 
 
 
 
  we get:
Lemma: For a line 
 
 
 
  (of 
 
 
 
 ) the following cases occur:

a) 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is called exterior line or
 
b) 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is called tangent line or
 
b′) 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is called tangent line or
 
c) 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  is called secant line.
 

Lemma: A line 
 
 
 
  through point 
 
 
 
  is a tangent line if and only if 
 
 
 
 .
Lemma:

a) 
 
 
 
  is a flat (projective subspace). 
 
 
 
 
  is called f-radical of quadric 
 
 
 
 .
 
b) 
 
 
 
  is a flat. 
 
 
 
  is called singular radical or 

 
 -radical of 
 
 
 
 
 .
 
c) In case of 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
 .
 

A quadric is called non-degenerate if 
 
 
 
 .
Remark: An oval conic is a non-degenerate quadric. In case of 
 
 
 
  its knot is the f-radical, i.e. 
 
 
 
 
 .
A quadric is a rather homogeneous object:
Lemma: For any point 
 
 
 
  there exists an involutorial central collineation

 
  with center 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Proof: Due to 
 
 
 
 
  the polar space 
 
 
 
  is a hyperplane.
The linear mapping



induces an involutorial central collineation with axis 
 
 
 
  and centre 
 
 
 
  which leaves 
 
 
 
 
  invariant.
 In case of 
 
 
 
  mapping 
 
 
 
  gets the familiar shape 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
 .
Remark:

a) The image of an exterior, tangent and secant line, respectively, by the involution 
 
 
 
  of the Lemma above is an exterior, tangent and secant line, respectively.
 
b) 
 
 
 
  is pointwise fixed by 
 
 
 
 .
 

Let be 
 
 
 
 
  the group of projective collineations of 
 
 
 
  which leaves 
 
 
 
  invariant. We get
Lemma:

 
  operates transitively on 
 
 
 
 .
A subspace 
 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is called 
 
 
 
 -subspace if 
 
 
 
  (for example: points on a sphere or lines on a hyperboloid (s. below)).
Lemma: Any two maximal

 
 -subspaces have the same dimension 
 
 
 
 
 .
Let be 
 
 
 
  the dimension of the maximal 
 
 
 
 -subspaces of 
 
 
 
 . The integer 
 
 
 
  is called index of

 
 
 .
Theorem: (BUEKENHOUT) For the index 
 
 
 
  of a non-degenerate quadric 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  the following is true
 
 
 
 .
Let be 
 
 
 
 
  a non-degenerate quadric in 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  its index.
 : In case of 
 
 
 
  quadric 
 
 
 
  is called sphere (or oval conic if 
 
 
 
 
 ).

In case of 
 
 
 
  quadric 
 
 
 
  is called hyperboloid (of one sheet).
 

Example:

a) Quadric 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  with form 
 
 
 
 
  is non-degenerate with index 1.
 
b) If polynomial 
 
 
 
  is irreducible over 
 
 
 
  the quadratic form 
 
 
 
  gives rise to a non-degenerate quadric 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 
 .
 
c) In 
 
 
 
  the quadratic form 
 
 
 
  gives rise to a hyperboloid.
 

Remark: It is not reasonable to define formally quadrics for "vector spaces" (strictly speaking, modules) over genuine skew fields (division rings). Because one would get secants bearing more than 2 points of the quadric which is totally different from usual quadrics. The reason is the following statement.
Theorem: A division ring

 
  is commutative if and only if any equation 
 
 
 has at most two solutions.
There are generalizations of quadrics: quadratic sets. A quadratic set is a set of points of a projective plane/space, which bears the same geometric properties as a quadric: any line intersects a quadratic set in no or 1 or two lines or is containt in the set.
