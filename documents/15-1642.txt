   L-serine-phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidyltransferase      L-serine-phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidyltransferase   L-serine-phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidyltransferase (, phosphatidylserine synthase 2 , serine-exchange enzyme II , PTDSS2 (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name L-1-phosphatidylethanolamine:L-serine phosphatidyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   L-1-phosphatidylethanolamine + L- serine    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-1-phosphatidylserine + ethanolamine    This enzyme catalyses replacement of a polar head group of phosphatidylethanolamine with L-serine.
