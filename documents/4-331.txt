Min-max theorem




Min-max theorem

In linear algebra and functional analysis, the min-max theorem, or variational theorem, or Courant–Fischer–Weyl min-max principle, is a result that gives a variational characterization of eigenvalues of compact Hermitian operators on Hilbert spaces. It can be viewed as the starting point of many results of similar nature.
This article first discusses the finite-dimensional case and its applications before considering compact operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We will see that for compact operators, the proof of the main theorem uses essentially the same idea from the finite-dimensional argument.
In the case that the operator is non-Hermitian, the theorem provides an equivalent characterization of the associated singular values. The min-max theorem can be extended to self-adjoint operators that are bounded below.
Matrices
Let 
 
 
 
  be a 
 
 
Hermitian matrix. As with many other variational results on eigenvalues, one considers the Rayleigh–Ritz quotient  defined by



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the Euclidean inner product on . Clearly, the Rayleigh quotient of an eigenvector is its associated eigenvalue. Equivalently, the Rayleigh–Ritz quotient can be replaced by



For Hermitian matrices, the range of the continuous function RA(x), or f(x), is a compact subset [a, b] of the real line. The maximum b and the minimum a are the largest and smallest eigenvalue of A, respectively. The min-max theorem is a refinement of this fact.
Min-max Theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be a 
 
 
Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues  then


 
  and


 
  in particular,


 
  and these bounds are attained when 
 
 
 
  is an eigenvector of the appropriate eigenvalues.
Also note that the simpler formulation for the maximal eigenvalue λn is given by:


 
  Similarly, the minimal eigenvalue λ1 is given by:



Proof
Since the matrix 
 
 
 
  is Hermitian it is diagonalizable and we can choose an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors {u1, ..., un} that is, ui is an eigenvector for the eigenvalue λi and such that (ui, ui) = 1 and (ui, uj) = 0 for all i ≠ j.
If U is a subspace of dimension k then its intersection with the subspace  isn't zero (by simply checking dimensions) and hence there exists a vector 
 
 
 
  in this intersection that we can write as



and whose Rayleigh quotient is


 
  (as all 
 
 
 
  for i=k,..,n) and hence


 
  Since this is true for all U, we can conclude that



This is one inequality. To establish the other inequality, chose the specific k-dimensional space , for which


 
  because 
 
 
 
  is the largest eigenvalue in V. Therefore, also



In the case where U is a subspace of dimension n-k+1, we proceed in a similar fashion: Consider the subspace of dimension k,  Its intersection with the subspace U isn't zero (by simply checking dimensions) and hence there exists a vector v in this intersection that we can write as


 
  and whose Rayleigh quotient is


 
  and hence


 
  Since this is true for all U, we can conclude that



Again, this is one part of the equation. To get the other inequality, note again that the eigenvector u of 
 
 
 
  is contained in so that we can conclude the equality.
Counterexample in the non-Hermitian case
Let N be the nilpotent matrix



Define the Rayleigh quotient 
 
 
 
  exactly as above in the Hermitian case. Then it is easy to see that the only eigenvalue of N is zero, while the maximum value of the Rayleigh ratio is 
 
 
 
 . That is, the maximum value of the Rayleigh quotient is larger than the maximum eigenvalue.
Applications
Min-max principle for singular values
The singular values {σk} of a square matrix M are the square roots of eigenvalues of M*M (equivalently MM*). An immediate consequence of the first equality from min-max theorem is



Similarly,



Cauchy interlacing theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be a symmetric n × n matrix. The m × m matrix B, where m ≤ n, is called a compression of 
 
 
 
  if there exists an orthogonal projection P onto a subspace of dimension m such that P*AP = B. The Cauchy interlacing theorem states:

Theorem. If the eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
  are , and those of B are , then for all 
 
 


This can be proven using the min-max principle. Let βi have corresponding eigenvector bi and Sj be the j dimensional subspace  then



According to first part of min-max,  On the other hand, if we define  then



where the last inequality is given by the second part of min-max.
Notice that, when 
 
 
 
 , we have , hence the name interlacing theorem.
Compact operators
Let 
 
 
 
  be a compact, Hermitian operator on a Hilbert space H. Recall that the spectrum of such an operator form a sequence of real numbers whose only possible cluster point is zero. Every nonzero number in the spectrum is an eigenvalue. It no longer makes sense here to list the positive eigenvalues in increasing order. Let the positive eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
  be



where multiplicity is taken into account as in the matrix case. When H is infinite-dimensional, the above sequence of eigenvalues is necessarily infinite. We now apply the same reasoning as in the matrix case. Letting Sk ⊂ H be a k dimensional subspace, we can obtain the following theorem.

Theorem (Min-Max). Let 
 
 
 
  be a compact, self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space 
 
 
 
 , whose positive eigenvalues are listed in decreasing order . Then:
 
 :


\max_{S_k} \min_{x \in S_k, \|x\| = 1} (Ax,x) &= \lambda_k ^{\downarrow}, \\ \min_{S_{k-1}} \max_{x \in S_{k-1}^{\perp}, \|x\|=1} (Ax, x) &= \lambda_k^{\downarrow}. \end{align}
A similar pair of equalities hold for negative eigenvalues.
Proof:  \max_{x \in S_{k-1}^{\perp}, \|x\|=1} (Ax, x) \ge \lambda_k.
Pick Sk−1 = span{u1, ..., uk−1} and we deduce

Self-adjoint operators
The min-max theorem also applies to (possibly unbounded) self-adjoint operators.1 2 Recall the essential spectrum is the spectrum without isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity. Sometimes we have some eigenvalues below the bottom of the eessential spectrum, and we would like to approximate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.
Theorem (Min-Max). Let A be self-adjoint, and let 
 
 
 
  be the eigenvalues of A below the essential spectrum. Then


 
 .
If we only have N eigenvalues and hence run out of eigenvalues, then we let 
 
 
 
  (the bottom of the essential spectrum) for n>N, and the above statement holds after replacing min-max with inf-sup.
Theorem (Max-Min). Let A be self-adjoint, and let 
 
 
 
  be the eigenvalues of A below the essential spectrum. Then


 
 .
If we only have N eigenvalues and hence run out of eigenvalues, then we let 
 
 
 
  (the bottom of the essential spectrum) for n>N, and the above statement holds after replacing max-min with sup-inf.
The proofs34 use the following results about self-adjoint operators:
Theorem. Let A be self-adjoint. Then 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 .
Theorem. If A is self-adjoint, then



and
$\sup\sigma(A)=\sup_{\psi\in\mathfrak{D}(A),\|\psi\|=1}\langle\psi,A\psi\rangle$.
