   MD5CRK      MD5CRK   In cryptography , MD5CRK was a distributed effort (similar to distributed.net ) launched by Jean-Luc Cooke and his company, CertainKey Cryptosystems , to demonstrate that the MD5  message digest  algorithm is insecure by finding a collision — two messages that produce the same MD5 hash. The project went live on March 1, 2004. The project ended on August 24, 2004 after researchers independently demonstrated a technique for generating collisions in MD5 using analytical methods by Xiaoyun Wang , Feng, Xuejia Lai , and Yu 1 . CertainKey awarded a 10,000 Canadian Dollar  prize to Wang, Feng, Lai and Yu for their discovery.  A technique called Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm was used to try to find a collision for MD5. The algorithm can be described by analogy with a random walk . Using the principle that any function with a finite number of possible outputs placed in a feedback loop will cycle, one can use a relatively small amount of memory to store outputs with particular structures and use them as "markers" to better detect when a marker has been "passed" before. These markers are called distinguished points , the point where two inputs produce the same output is called a collision point . MD5CRK considered any point whose first 32 bits were zeroes to be a distinguished point.  Complexity  The expected time to find a collision is not equal to    2  N     superscript  2  N    2^{N}   where   N   N   N   is the number of bits in the digest output. It is in fact      2  N   !      (    2  N   -  K   )   !   ×   2   N   K           superscript  2  N           superscript  2  N   K     superscript   superscript  2  N   K      2^{N}!\over{(2^{N}-K)!\times{2^{N}}^{K}}   , where   K   K   K   is the number of function outputs collected.  For this project, the probability of success after   K   K   K   MD5 computations can be approximated by    1   1  -   e    K  ×   (   1  -  K   )     2   N  +  1           1    1   superscript  e      K    1  K     superscript  2    N  1         1\over{1-e^{K\times(1-K)\over 2^{N+1}}}   .  The expected number of computations required to produce a collision in the 128-bit MD5 message digest function is thus     1.17741  ×   2   N  /  2     =   1.17741  ×   2  64          1.17741   superscript  2    N  2       1.17741   superscript  2  64      {1.17741\times 2^{N/2}}={1.17741\times 2^{64}}     To give some perspective to this, using Virginia Tech's System X with a max performance of 12.25 Teraflops, it would take approximately       2.17  ×   10  19    /  12.25   ×   10  12    ≈   1  ,  770  ,  000             2.17   superscript  10  19    12.25    superscript  10  12     1  770  000     {2.17\times 10^{19}/12.25\times 10^{12}\approx 1,770,000}   seconds or about 3 weeks. Or for commodity processors at 2 gigaflops it would take 6,000 machines approximately the same amount of time.
