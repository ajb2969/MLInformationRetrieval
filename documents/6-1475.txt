   Serre's modularity conjecture      Serre's modularity conjecture  In [[mathematics]], '''Serre's modularity conjecture''', introduced by [[Jean-Pierre Serre]]  {{harvs|last=Serre|authorlink=|year1=1975|year2=1987}}, states that an odd, irreducible, two-dimensional [[Galois representation]] over a [[finite field]] arises from a modular fo rm, and a stronger version of his conjecture specifies the weight and level of the modular form. It was proved by Chandrashekhar Khare in the level 1 case, 1 in 2005 and later in 2008 a proof of the full conjecture was worked out jointly by Khare and Jean-Pierre Wintenberger . 2  Formulation  The conjecture concerns the absolute Galois group     G  ℚ     subscript  G  ℚ    G_{\mathbb{Q}}   of the rational number field    ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   .  Let   ρ   ρ   \rho   be an absolutely irreducible , continuous, two-dimensional representation of    G  ℚ     subscript  G  ℚ    G_{\mathbb{Q}}   over a finite field    F  =   𝔽   ℓ  r        F   subscript  𝔽   superscript  normal-ℓ  r      F=\mathbb{F}_{\ell^{r}}   .       ρ  :    G  ℚ   →    GL  2    (  F  )      .     normal-:  ρ   normal-→   subscript  G  ℚ      subscript  GL  2   F      \rho:G_{\mathbb{Q}}\rightarrow\mathrm{GL}_{2}(F).     Additionally, assume   ρ   ρ   \rho   is odd, meaning the image of complex conjugation has determinant -1.  To any normalized modular eigenform      f  =   q  +    a  2    q  2    +    a  3    q  3    +  ⋯       f    q     subscript  a  2    superscript  q  2       subscript  a  3    superscript  q  3    normal-⋯     f=q+a_{2}q^{2}+a_{3}q^{3}+\cdots     of level     N  =   N   (  ρ  )        N    N  ρ     N=N(\rho)   , weight     k  =   k   (  ρ  )        k    k  ρ     k=k(\rho)   , and some Nebentype character      χ  :     ℤ  /  N   ℤ   →   F  *       normal-:  χ   normal-→      ℤ  N   ℤ    superscript  F       \chi:\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow F^{*}   ,  a theorem due to Shimura, Deligne, and Serre-Deligne attaches to   f   f   f   a representation        ρ  f   :    G  ℚ   →    GL  2    (  𝒪  )      ,     normal-:   subscript  ρ  f    normal-→   subscript  G  ℚ      subscript  GL  2   𝒪      \rho_{f}:G_{\mathbb{Q}}\rightarrow\mathrm{GL}_{2}(\mathcal{O}),     where   𝒪   𝒪   \mathcal{O}   is the ring of integers in a finite extension of    ℚ  ℓ     subscript  ℚ  normal-ℓ    \mathbb{Q}_{\ell}   . This representation is characterized by the condition that for all prime numbers   p   p   p   , coprime to    N  ℓ      N  normal-ℓ    N\ell   we have       Trace   (    ρ  f    (   Frob  p   )    )    =   a  p        Trace     subscript  ρ  f    subscript  Frob  p      subscript  a  p     \operatorname{Trace}(\rho_{f}(\operatorname{Frob}_{p}))=a_{p}     and        det   (    ρ  f    (   Frob  p   )    )    =    p   k  -  1    χ   (  p  )     .           subscript  ρ  f    subscript  Frob  p        superscript  p    k  1    χ  p     \det(\rho_{f}(\operatorname{Frob}_{p}))=p^{k-1}\chi(p).     Reducing this representation modulo the maximal ideal of   𝒪   𝒪   \mathcal{O}   gives a mod   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   representation     ρ  f   ¯     normal-¯   subscript  ρ  f     \overline{\rho_{f}}   of    G  ℚ     subscript  G  ℚ    G_{\mathbb{Q}}   .  Serre's conjecture asserts that for any   ρ   ρ   \rho   as above, there is a modular eigenform   f   f   f   such that        ρ  f   ¯   ≅  ρ       normal-¯   subscript  ρ  f    ρ    \overline{\rho_{f}}\cong\rho   .  The level and weight of the conjectural form   f   f   f   are explicitly calculated in Serre's article. In addition, he derives a number of results from this conjecture, among them Fermat's Last Theorem and the now-proven Taniyama–Weil (or Taniyama–Shimura) conjecture, now known as the modularity theorem (although this implies Fermat's Last Theorem, Serre proves it directly from his conjecture).  Optimal level and weight  The strong form of Serre's conjecture describes the level and weight of the modular form.  The optimal level is the Artin conductor of the representation, with the power of l removed.  Proof  A proof of the level 1 and small weight cases of the conjecture was obtained during 2004 by Chandrashekhar Khare and Jean-Pierre Wintenberger , 3 and by Luis Dieulefait , 4 independently.  In 2005, Chandrashekhar Khare obtained a proof of the level 1 case of Serre conjecture, 5 and in 2008 a proof of the full conjecture in collaboration with Jean-Pierre Wintenberger. 6  Notes  References       External links   Serre's Modularity Conjecture 50 minute lecture by Ken Ribet given on October 25, 2007 ( slides PDF, other version of slides PDF)  Lectures on Serre's conjectures   "  Category:Modular forms  Category:Theorems in number theory     . ↩  and . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  and . ↩
