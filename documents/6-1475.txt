Serre's modularity conjecture
In [[mathematics]], '''Serre's modularity conjecture''', introduced by [[Jean-Pierre Serre]]  {{harvs|last=Serre|authorlink=|year1=1975|year2=1987}}, states that an odd, irreducible, two-dimensional [[Galois representation]] over a [[finite field]] arises from a modular fo
 
 rm, and a stronger version of his conjecture specifies the weight and level of the modular form. It was proved by Chandrashekhar Khare in the level 1 case,1 in 2005 and later in 2008 a proof of the full conjecture was worked out jointly by Khare and Jean-Pierre Wintenberger.2
Formulation
The conjecture concerns the absolute Galois group

 
  of the rational number field

 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be an absolutely irreducible, continuous, two-dimensional representation of 
 
 
 
  over a finite field 
 
 
 
 .



Additionally, assume 
 
 
 
  is odd, meaning the image of complex conjugation has determinant -1.
To any normalized modular eigenform

 , weight

 
 , and some Nebentype character


 
 ,
a theorem due to Shimura, Deligne, and Serre-Deligne attaches to 
 
 
 
  a representation



where 
 
 
 
  is the ring of integers in a finite extension of 
 
 
 
 . This representation is characterized by the condition that for all prime numbers 
 
 
 
 , coprime to 
 
 
 
  we have



and



Reducing this representation modulo the maximal ideal of 
 
 
 
  gives a mod 
 
 
 
  representation 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 .
Serre's conjecture asserts that for any 
 
 
 
  as above, there is a modular eigenform 
 
 
 
  such that


 
 .
The level and weight of the conjectural form 
 
 
 
  are explicitly calculated in Serre's article. In addition, he derives a number of results from this conjecture, among them Fermat's Last Theorem and the now-proven Taniyama–Weil (or Taniyama–Shimura) conjecture, now known as the modularity theorem (although this implies Fermat's Last Theorem, Serre proves it directly from his conjecture).
Optimal level and weight
The strong form of Serre's conjecture describes the level and weight of the modular form.
The optimal level is the Artin conductor of the representation, with the power of l removed.
Proof
A proof of the level 1 and small weight cases of the conjecture was obtained during 2004 by Chandrashekhar Khare and Jean-Pierre Wintenberger,3 and by Luis Dieulefait,4 independently.
In 2005, Chandrashekhar Khare obtained a proof of the level 1 case of Serre conjecture,5 and in 2008 a proof of the full conjecture in collaboration with Jean-Pierre Wintenberger.6
