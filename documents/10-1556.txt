   (S)-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase      (S)-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase   In enzymology , a (S)-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-6-hydroxynicotine + H 2 O + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-(6-hydroxypyridin-3-yl)-4-(methylamino)butan-1-one + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (S)-6-hydroxynicotine , H 2 O , and O 2 , whereas its two products are 1-(6-hydroxypyridin-3-yl)-4-(methylamino)butan-1-one and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-6-hydroxynicotine:oxygen oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include L-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase , 6-hydroxy-L-nicotine oxidase , and 6-hydroxy-L-nicotine:oxygen oxidoreductase . It employs one cofactor , FAD .
