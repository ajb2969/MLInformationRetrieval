   Alizarin 2-beta-glucosyltransferase      Alizarin 2-beta-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , an alizarin 2-beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + alizarin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 1-hydroxy-2-(beta-D-glucosyloxy)-9,10-anthraquinone   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and alizarin , whereas its two products are UDP and 1-hydroxy-2-(beta-D-glucosyloxy)-9,10-anthraquinone .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:1,2-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone 2-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase . This enzyme is also called uridine diphosphoglucose-alizarin glucosyltransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
