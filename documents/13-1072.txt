   Castelnuovo–Mumford regularity      Castelnuovo–Mumford regularity   In algebraic geometry , the Castelnuovo–Mumford regularity of a coherent sheaf  F over projective space  P n is the smallest integer r such that it is r-regular , meaning that        H  i    (   𝐏  n   ,   F   (   r  -  i   )    )    =   0          superscript  H  i     superscript  𝐏  n     F    r  i      0    H^{i}(\mathbf{P}^{n},F(r-i))=0\,     whenever i > 0. The regularity of a subscheme is defined to be the regularity of its sheaf of ideals. The regularity controls when the Hilbert function of the sheaf becomes a polynomial; more precisely dim H 0 ( P n , F ( m )) is a polynomial in m when m is at least the regularity. The concept of r -regularity was introduced by , who attributed the following results to Guido Castelnuovo :   An r -regular sheaf is s -regular for any s ≥ r .  If a coherent sheaf is r -regular then F ( r ) is generated by its global sections .   Graded modules  A related idea exists in commutative algebra . Suppose R = k [ x 0 ,..., x n ] is a polynomial ring over a field  k and M is a finitely generated  graded R -module . Suppose M has a minimal graded free resolution      ⋯  →   F  j   →  ⋯  →   F  0   →  M  →  0       normal-→  normal-⋯   subscript  F  j     normal-→    normal-⋯    normal-→     subscript  F  0     normal-→    M    normal-→    0     \cdots\rightarrow F_{j}\rightarrow\cdots\rightarrow F_{0}\rightarrow M\rightarrow
 0   and let b j be the maximum of the degrees of the generators of F j . If r is an integer such that b j - j ≤ r for all j , then M is said to be r -regular. The regularity of M is the smallest such r .  These two notions of regularity coincide when F is a coherent sheaf such that Ass( F ) contains no closed points. Then the graded module    ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus    d∈ Z  H 0 ( P n , F ( d ))}} is finitely generated and has the same regularity as F .  References       "  Category:Algebraic geometry
