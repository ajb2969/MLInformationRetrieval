Idoling!!! Programs
Idoling!!! TV show is airing in three different medias; the CS, the On Demand, and the Terrestrial broadcast. Each has different packaging.
Fuji TV CS
The Idoling!!! program started on October 30, 2006, airing every weekday on two Fuji TV's satellite channels, Fuji TV 739 (also formerly on Fuji TV 721) and Fuji TV CSHD. On this version, the TV show is unedited. Since 2009, the show is airing two and three times per week. Since the show is unedited, mistakes and happenings can be seen sometimes throughout the show, for example was episode 459.75 The show is a variety show, making each airing different. However, there are a few recurring core segments.




'''Mani Idol

!'''

This segment is Idoling

!'s miscellaneous segment. Anything from racing Mini Yonku (Mini 4WD) to learning how to finger-whistle is dealt with in this segment.



'''Ganbaringu

!'''

This segment is Idoling

!'s miscellaneous physical activity / sport segment. Past challenges included having all the members jump rope simultaneously, dribble basketballs through an obstacle course of supine staff members and participate in badminton games where the position of the fallen shuttlecock determines a specific punishment.



'''Iisō Shiritori

!'''

The members sit in a semicircle and play a game of Shiritori. The challenge lies in the rule that the contribution must be a sentence that would be said by something specific (a school-teacher, a nurse, a lottery winner, etc.). A new sentence must start with the same syllable as the previous one ended. If they stutter, reuse a line or end their sentence with an nn /ん sound, they are disqualified and held still while a staff member in a white unitard blasts them in the face with a leaf-blower.



'''Fan-sama Request

!'''

Fans submit a specific phrase or sentence online that they want the members to say. One by one, the members stand behind a device with a rising panel and deliver their lines as appropriately or as cutely as they can. A winner is chosen once everyone has had their turn.



Other segments
 These segments are fairly new or do not appear as frequently as the above. Segments will often gain temporary popularity with the staff and fans, resulting in recurring airings for a short period, followed by a period where the once-popular segment does not air at all.




'''Zenin Seikai Itadakimasu Quiz

!'''

The members are presented with some type of food or dessert and must identify it. All members must have written the correct name to permit anyone to enjoy the food. If even a single member does not answer correctly, the entire group must drink a bitter tea concoction.



'''Eigo de GO! GO! GO

!'''

Hashimoto, Asahi and Morita (named Nancy, George and Pinky for this segment) are suspected to have the worst grasp of English in the entire group. In this segment, they attempt to translate well-known Japanese phrases to the rest of the members. The members then do their best to decipher the phrase through the mangled English.



Baka-Rizumu wa Dare Da?

"Who is Baka-Rhythm?" In this segment, four members are chosen at a time to sit separate from the group. They all don an earpiece with the catch being that only a single headphone broadcasts a live-feed from Masuno, who sits in a vocal-booth off stage. Masuno commands the affected member to write or act-out various things. Once finished, the watching members must wager a guess at which participant was acting through Masuno's instruction.



Fuji TV On Demand
Fuji TV On Demand is a paid streaming service. The On Demand duration of each episode depends on the filming, sometimes it can be 40 minutes long with the first 27 minutes the same as broadcast on the CS version. On Demand currently streams in MP4 format (1280x720 pixels, 2000 kbit/s bitrate).76
Fuji TV Terrestrial
The terrestrial channel is known as Fuji TV main channel(CX), which is free but only available around Tokyo. The show known as , formerly . Idoling!!! show in this broadcast is edited to fit the 30 minutes slot with commercials, sometimes cramped two CS episodes into one. The edit includes narration, additional captions, and extra segment which is not available on other broadcasts. One of those segments is ARG started in December 29, 2012.77
uRaIdoling!!!
uRaIdoling is a special collection of Idoling episodes available only to fanclub members. These episodes feature a behind-the-scenes look at the various activities of the members (and occasionally the staff) when they are not filming the main show. These episodes are not constrained to any format and cover topics and subjects with no specificity. Some examples of episodes include visiting member's houses, cooking with members, games or discussions between small groups of members, solo interviews, photo-shoot documentaries, and PV "making of" documentaries.
Gekkan Idoling!!!
Gekkan Idoling can be considered Idoling's monthly specials. These episodes feature off-location activities such as cooking lessons, camping trips, games. They are similar to uRaIdoling in their miscellaneousness, though they are longer in length and feature most, if not all, members. The full episodes were later released in a longer format on DVD for fan club members. After a year, Gekkan Idoling!!! became a direct-to-DVD production without TV broadcast.
Idoling!!! YouTube Channel
Since April 17, 2012, Idoling!!! started its official YouTube channel.78 Other than streaming old collections of TV show episode and Gekkan Idoling!!!, it also streams 2–3 minutes video called  every weekday, and 10 minutes video called  every week. Daily Idoling!!! features member(s) daily activity, free talk, event report, etc. Weekly Idoling!!! features member(s) doing some challenge segment, field report, promotion video making-of, etc.
