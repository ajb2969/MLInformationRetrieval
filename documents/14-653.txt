Quasitoric manifold

In mathematics, a quasitoric manifold is a topological analogue of the nonsingular projective toric variety of algebraic geometry. A smooth

 
 -dimensional manifold is a quasitoric manifold if it admits a smooth, locally standard action of an 

 
 -dimensional torus, with orbit space an 
 
 
 
 -dimensional simple convex polytope.
Quasitoric manifolds were introduced in 1991 by M. Davis and T. Januszkiewicz,1 who called them "toric manifolds". However, the term "quasitoric manifold" was eventually adopted to avoid confusion with the class of compact smooth toric varieties, which are known to algebraic geometers as toric manifolds.2
Quasitoric manifolds are studied in a variety of contexts in algebraic topology, such as complex cobordism theory, and the other oriented cohomology theories.3
Definitions
Denote the 
 
 
 
 -th subcircle of the 
 
 
 
 
 -torus 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
 . Then coordinate-wise multiplication of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 
  is called the standard representation.
Given open sets 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , that are closed under the action of 
 
 
 
 
 , a 
 
 
 
 -action on 
 
 
 
  is defined to be locally isomorphic to the standard representation if 
 
 
 
 , for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a homeomorphism

 
 , and 
 
 
 
 
  is an automorphism of 
 
 
 
 .
Given a simple convex polytope 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
facets, a 
 
 
 
 -manifold 
 
 
 
 
  is a quasitoric manifold over

 
  if,

the 
 
 
 
 -action is locally isomorphic to the standard representation,
there is a projection

 
  that maps each 
 
 
 
 -dimensional orbit to a point in the interior of an 
 
 
 
 
 -dimensional face of 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 


 
 .

The definition implies that the fixed points of 
 
 
 
 
  under the 
 
 
 
 -action are mapped to the vertices of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 , while points where the action is free project to the interior of the polytope.
The dicharacteristic function
A quasitoric manifold can be described in terms of a dicharacteristic function and an associated dicharacteristic matrix. In this setting it is useful to assume that the facets 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 
  are ordered so that the intersection 
 
 
 
  is a vertex 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , called the initial vertex.
A dicharacteristic function is a homomorphism

 
 , such that if 
 
 
 
 
  is a codimension-
 
 
 
  face of 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is a monomorphism on restriction to the subtorus 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 
 .
The restriction of λ to the subtorus 
 
 
 
  corresponding to the initial vertex 
 
 
 
  is an isomorphism, and so 
 
 
 
  can be taken to be a basis for the Lie algebra of 
 
 
 
 . The epimorphism of Lie algebras associated to λ may be described as a linear transformation 
 
 
 
 
 , represented by the 
 
 
dicharacteristic matrix

 
  given by






\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & \lambda_{1, n+1} & \dots & \lambda_{1, m}\\ 0 & 1 & \dots & 0 & \lambda_{2, n+1} & \dots & \lambda_{2, m}\\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \dots & 1 & \lambda_{n, n+1} & \dots & \lambda_{n, m} \end{bmatrix}. 
The 
 
 
 
 th column of 
 
 
 
  is a primitive vector 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , called the facet vector. As each facet vector is primitive, whenever the facets 
 
 
 
  meet in a vertex, the corresponding columns 
 
 
 
  form a basis of 
 
 
 
 , with determinant equal to 
 
 
 
 
 . The isotropy subgroup associated to each facet 
 
 
 
  is described by








for some 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
In their original treatment of quasitoric manifolds, Davis and Januskiewicz4 introduced the notion of a characteristic function that mapped each facet of the polytope to a vector determining the isotropy subgroup of the facet, but this is only defined up to sign. In more recent studies of quasitoric manifolds, this ambiguity has been removed by the introduction of the dicharacteristic function and its insistence that each circle 
 
 
 
 
  be oriented, forcing a choice of sign for each vector 
 
 
 
 . The notion of the dicharacteristic function was originally introduced V. Buchstaber and N. Ray5 to enable the study of quasitoric manifolds in complex cobordism theory. This was further refined by introducing the ordering of the facets of the polytope to define the initial vertex, which eventually leads to the above neat representation of the dicharacteristic matrix 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the identity matrix and 
 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
  submatrix.6
Relation to the moment-angle complex
The kernel 
 
 
 
  of the dicharacteristic function acts freely on the moment angle complex

 
 , and so defines a principal

 
 -bundle 
 
 
 
 
  over the resulting quotient space

 
 . This quotient space can be viewed as








where pairs 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 
  are identified if and only if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is in the image of 
 
 
 
  on restriction to the subtorus 
 
 
 
  that corresponds to the unique face 
 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  containing the point 
 
 
 
 , for some 
 
 
 
 .
It can be shown that any quasitoric manifold 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
 
  is equivariently diffeomorphic to a quasitoric manifold of the form of the quotient space above.7
Examples

The 
 
 
 
 -dimensional complex projective space

 
  is a quasitoric manifold over the 
 
 
 
 -simplex

 
 . If 
 
 
 
 
  is embedded in 
 
 
 
  so that the origin is the initial vertex, a dicharacteristic function can be chosen so that the associated dicharacteristic matrix is







\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & -1\\ 0 & 1 & \dots & 0 & -1\\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \dots & 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix}. 
The moment angle complex 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
 -sphere 
 
 
 
 , the kernel 
 
 
 
 
  is the diagonal subgroup 
 
 
 
 , so the quotient of 
 
 
 
  under the action of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 .8

The Bott manifolds that form the stages in a Bott tower are quasitoric manifolds over 

 
 
 -cubes. The 
 
 
 
 -cube 
 
 
 
  is embedded in 
 
 
 
  so that the origin is the initial vertex, and a dicharacteristic function is chosen so that the associated dicharacteristic matrix 
 
 
 
  has 
 
 
 
 
  given by







\begin{bmatrix} 1 &0 &\cdots &0 &0 &\cdots &0 &0 \\ -a(1,2) &1 &\cdots &0 &0 &\cdots &0 &0 \\ \vdots &\vdots & &\vdots &\vdots & &\vdots &\vdots \\ -a(1,i) &-a(2,i) &\cdots &-a(i-1,i) &1 &\cdots &0 &0 \\ \vdots &\vdots & &\vdots &\vdots & &\vdots &\vdots \\ -a(1,n) &-a(2,n) &\cdots &-a(i-1,n) &-a(i,n) &\cdots &-a(n-1,n) &1 \end{bmatrix}, 
for integers 
 
 
 
 .
The moment angle complex 
 
 
 
  is a product of 
 
 
 
  copies of 3-sphere embedded in 
 
 
 
 , the kernel 
 
 
 
 
  is given by




 
 ,
 



so that the quotient of 
 
 
 
  under the action of 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
 -th stage of a Bott tower.9 The integer values 
 
 
 
 
  are the tensor powers of the line bundles whose product is used in the iterated sphere-bundle construction of the Bott tower.10

can be associated with each facet 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  acts on 
 
 
 
 , by the restriction of 
 
 
 
  to the 
 
 
 
 
 -th subcircle of 
 
 
 
  embedded in 
 
 
 
 . These bundles are known as the facial bundles associated to the quasitoric manifold. By the definition of 
 
 
 
 , the preimage of a facet 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 
 -dimensional quasitoric facial submanifold

 
  over 
 
 
 
 , whose isotropy subgroup is the restriction of 
 
 
 
  on the subcircle 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 
 . Restriction of 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  gives the normal 2-plane bundle of the embedding of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  denote the first Chern class of 
 
 
 
 . The integral cohomology ring

 
  is generated by 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 
 
 
 , subject to two sets of relations. The first are the relations generated by the Stanley–Reisner ideal of 
 
 
 
 ; linear relations determined by the dicharacterstic function comprise the second set:




 
 .
 



Therefore only 
 
 
 
  are required to generate 
 
 
 
  multiplicatively.11
Comparison with toric manifolds

Any projective toric manifold is a quasitoric manifold, and in some cases non-projective toric manifolds are also quasitoric manifolds.


Not all quasitoric manifolds are toric manifolds. For example, the connected sum

 
 
  can be constructed as a quasitoric manifold, but it is not a toric manifold.12
