   Site-specific DNA-methyltransferase (cytosine-N4-specific)      Site-specific DNA-methyltransferase (cytosine-N4-specific)   Site-specific DNA-methyltransferase (cytosine-N4-specific) (, modification methylase , restriction-modification system , DNA[cytosine-N4]methyltransferase , m4C-forming MTase , S-adenosyl-L-methionine:DNA-cytosine 4-N-methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:DNA-cytosine N4-methyltransferase . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + DNA cytosine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + DNA N4-methylcytosine   This is a large group of enzymes. 5  References  See also   DNA methyltransferase   External links     "  Category:EC 2.1.1     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
