In continuum mechanics, Whitham's averaged Lagrangian method – or in short Whitham's method – is used to study the Lagrangian dynamics of slowly-varying wave trains in an inhomogeneous (moving) medium. The method is applicable to both linear and non-linear systems. As a direct consequence of the averaging used in the method, wave action is a conserved property of the wave motion. In contrast, the wave energy is not necessarily conserved, due to the exchange of energy with the mean motion. However the total energy, the sum of the energies in the wave motion and the mean motion, will be conserved for a time-invariant Lagrangian. Further, the averaged Lagrangian has a strong relation to the dispersion relation of the system.
The method is due to Gerald Whitham, who developed it in the 1960s. It is for instance used in the modelling of surface gravity waves on fluid interfaces,12 and in plasma physics.34
Resulting equations for pure wave motion
In case a Lagrangian formulation of a continuum mechanics system is available, the averaged Lagrangian methodology can be used to find approximations for the average dynamics of wave motion – and (eventually) for the interaction between the wave motion and the mean motion – assuming the envelope dynamics of the carrier waves is slowly varying. Phase averaging of the Lagrangian results in an averaged Lagrangian, which is always independent of the wave phase itself (but depends on slowly varying wave quantities like wave amplitude, frequency and wavenumber). By Noether's theorem, variation of the averaged Lagrangian 
 
 
 
  with respect to the invariant wave phase 
 
 
 
  then gives rise to a conservation law:5

  respectively. Further 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denote space and time respectively, while 
 
 
 
  is the gradient operator. The angular frequency

 
  and wavenumber

 
  are defined as7
and both are assumed to be slowly varying. Due to this definition, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have to satisfy the consistency relations:
The first consistency equation is known as the conservation of wave crests, and the second states that the wavenumber field 
 
 
 
  is irrotational (i.e. has zero curl).
Method
The averaged Lagrangian approach applies to wave motion – possibly superposed on a mean motion – that can be described in a Lagrangian formulation. Using an ansatz on the form of the wave part of the motion, the Lagrangian is phase averaged. Since the Lagrangian is associated with the kinetic energy and potential energy of the motion, the oscillations contribute to the Lagrangian, although the mean value of the wave's oscillatory excursion is zero (or very small).
The resulting averaged Lagrangian contains wave characteristics like the wavenumber, angular frequency and amplitude (or equivalently the wave's energy density or wave action). But the wave phase itself is absent due to the phase averaging. Consequently, through Noether's theorem, there is a conservation law called the conservation of wave action.
Originally the averaged Lagrangian method was developed by Whitham for slowly-varying dispersive wave trains.8 Several extensions have been made, e.g. to interacting wave components,910 Hamiltonian mechanics,1112 higher-order modulational effects,13 dissipation effects.14
Variational formulation
The averaged Lagrangian method requires the existence of a Lagrangian describing the wave motion. For instance for a field

 
 , described by a Lagrangian density

 
  the principle of stationary action is:15



with 
 
 
 
  the gradient operator and 
 
 
 
  the time derivative operator. This action principle results in the Euler–Lagrange equation:16



which is the second-order partial differential equation describing the dynamics of 
 
 
 
  Higher-order partial differential equations require the inclusion of higher than first-order derivatives in the Lagrangian.17

Example

For example, consider a non-dimensional and non-linear Klein–Gordon equation in one space dimension 
 
 
 
 :18
This Euler–Lagrange equation emerges from the Lagrangian density:19
The small-amplitude approximation for the Sine–Gordon equation corresponds with the value 
 
 
20 For 
 
 
 
  the system is linear and the classical one-dimensional Klein–Gordon equation is obtained.
Slowly-varying waves
Slowly-varying linear waves
Whitham developed several approaches to obtain a averaged Lagrangian method.2122 The simplest one is for slowly-varying linear wavetrains, which method will be applied here.23
The slowly-varying wavetrain – without mean motion – in a linear dispersive system is described as:24


 
   with  
 
 
 
   and  
 
 

where 
 
 
 
  is the real-valued wave phase, 
 
 
 
  denotes the absolute value of the complex-valued amplitude

 
  while 
 
 
 
  is its argument and 
 
 
 
  denotes its real part. The real-valued amplitude and phase shift are denoted by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively.
Now, by definition, the angular frequency

 
  and wavenumber vector 
 
 
 
  are expressed as the time derivative and gradient of the wave phase 
 
 
 
  as:25


 
   and  
 
 

As a consequence, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have to satisfy the consistency relations:


 
   and  
 
 

These two consistency relations denote the "conservation of wave crests", and the irrotationality of the wavenumber field.
Because of the assumption of slow variations in the wave train – as well as in a possible inhomogeneous medium and mean motion – the quantities 
 
 



 
  and 
 
 
 
  all vary slowly in space 
 
 
 
  and time 
 
 
 
  – but the wave phase 
 
 
 
  itself does not vary slowly. Consequently, derivatives of 
 
 


 
  and 
 
 
 
  are neglected in the determination of the derivatives of 
 
 
 
  for use in the averaged Lagrangian:26


 
   and  
 
 

Next these assumptions on 
 
 
 
  and its derivatives are applied to the Lagrangian density 
 
 

Slowly-varying non-linear waves
Several approaches to slowly-varying non-linear wavetrains are possible. One is by the use of Stokes expansions,27 used by Whitham to analyse slowly-varying Stokes waves.28 A Stokes expansion of the field 
 
 
 
  can be written as:29



where the amplitudes 
 
 

 
  etc. are slowly varying, as are the phases 
 
 

 
  etc. As for the linear wave case, in lowest order (as far as modulational effects are concerned) derivatives of amplitudes and phases are neglected, except for derivatives 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  of the fast phase 
 
 



 
   and



These approximations are to be applied in the Lagrangian density 
 
 
 
 , and its phase average 
 
 

Averaged Lagrangian for slowly-varying waves
For pure wave motion the Lagrangian 
 
 
 
  is expressed in terms of the field 
 
 
 
  and its derivatives.3031 In the averaged Lagrangian method, the above-given assumptions on the field 
 
 
 
  – and its derivatives – are applied to calculate the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is thereafter averaged over the wave phase 
 
 
32



As a last step, this averaging result 
 
 
 
  can be expressed as the averaged Lagrangian density 
 
 
 
  – which is a function of the slowly varying parameters 
 
 

 
  and 
 
 
 
  and independent of the wave phase 
 
 
 
  itself.33
The averaged Lagrangian density 
 
 
 
  is now proposed by Whitham to follow the average variational principle:34
From the variations of 
 
 
 
  follow the dynamical equations for the slowly-varying wave properties.

Example

Continuing on the example of the nonlinear Klein–Gordon equation, see equations  and , and applying the above approximations for 
 
 

 
  and 
 
 
 
  (for this 1D example) in the Lagrangian density, the result after averaging over 
 
 
 
  is:


 
  where it has been assumed that, in big-O notation, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Variation of 
 
 
 
  with respect to 
 
 
 
  leads to 
 
 
 
  So the averaged Lagrangian is:
For linear wave motion the averaged Lagrangian is obtained by setting 
 
 
 
  equal to zero.
Set of equations emerging from the averaged Lagrangian
Applying the averaged Lagrangian principle, variation with respect to the wave phase 
 
 
 
  leads to the conservation of wave action:



since 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  while the wave phase 
 
 
 
  does not appear in the averaged Lagrangian density 
 
 
 
  due to the phase averaging. Defining the wave action as 
 
 
 
 
  and the wave action flux as 
 
 
 
  the result is:



The wave action equation is accompanied with the consistency equations for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  which are:


 
   and  
 
 

Variation with respect to the amplitude 
 
 
 
  leads to the dispersion relation



Example

Continuing with the nonlinear Klein–Gordon equation, using the average variational principle on equation , the wave action equation becomes by variation with respect to the wave phase 
 
 




and the nonlinear dispersion relation follows from variation with respect to the amplitude 
 
 




So the wave action is 
 
 
 
  and the wave action flux 
 
 
 
  The group velocity

 
 
  is 
 
 

Mean motion and pseudo-phase
Conservation of wave action
The averaged Lagrangian is obtained by integration of the Lagrangian over the wave phase. As a result, the averaged Lagrangian only contains the derivatives of the wave phase 
 
 
 
  (these derivatives being, by definition, the angular frequency and wavenumber) and does not depend on the wave phase itself. So the solutions will be independent of the choice of the zero level for the wave phase. Consequently – by Noether's theorem – variation of the averaged Lagrangian 
 
 
 
  with respect to the wave phase results in a conservation law:

  denotes the partial derivative with respect to time, and 
 
 
 
  is the gradient operator. By definition, the group velocity

 
 
  is given by:



Note that in general the energy of the wave motion does not need to be conserved, since there can be an energy exchange with a mean flow. The total energy – the sum of the energies of the wave motion and the mean flow – is conserved (when there is no work by external forces and no energy dissipation by viscosity).
Conservation of wave action is also found by applying the generalized Lagrangian mean (GLM) method to the equations of the combined flow of waves and mean motion, using Newtonian mechanics instead of a variational approach.35
Conservation of energy and momentum
Connection to the dispersion relation
Pure wave motion by linear models always leads to an averaged Lagrangian density of the form:36



Consequently, the variation with respect to amplitude
 
 
 
  gives



So this turns out to be the dispersion relation for the linear waves, and the averaged Lagrangian for linear waves is always the dispersion function 
 
 
 
 
  times the amplitude squared.
More generally, for weakly nonlinear and slowly modulated waves propagating in one space dimension and including higher-order dispersion effects – not neglecting the time and space derivatives 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  of the amplitude 
 
 
 
  when taking derivatives, where 
 
 
 
  is a small modulation parameter – the averaged Lagrangian density is of the form:37
