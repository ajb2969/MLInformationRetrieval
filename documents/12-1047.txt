   Alan Baker (mathematician)      Alan Baker (mathematician)   Alan Baker , FRS (born 19 August 1939) is an English  mathematician , known for his work on effective methods in Number theory, in particular those arising from transcendence theory .  Life  Alan Baker was born in London on 19 August 1939. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1970, at age 31. His academic career started as a student of Harold Davenport , at University College London and later at Cambridge. He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in the fall of 1970. 1 He is a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge .  His interests are in number theory, transcendence , logarithmic form , effective methods , Diophantine geometry and Diophantine analysis .  In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society . 2  Accomplishments  Baker generalized the Gelfond-Schneider Theorem , itself a solution to Hilbert's seventh problem . 3 Specifically, he showed that if $\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n$ are algebraic numbers (besides 0 or 1), and if $\beta_1,..,\beta_n$ are irrational algebraic numbers such that the set $\{1,\beta_1,...,\beta_n\}$ are linearly independent over the rational numbers, then the number $\alpha_1^{\beta_1}\alpha_2^{\beta_2}\cdots\alpha_n^{\beta_n}$ is transcendental.
