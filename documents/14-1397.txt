   Carl Severin Wigert      Carl Severin Wigert   Carl Severin Wigert (1871–1941) was a Swedish mathematician who introduced Stieltjes–Wigert polynomials and worked on the divisor function , including correctly describing its maximal order of growth. Wigert proved that        lim sup   n  →  ∞       log  d    (  n  )     log   n  /   log   log  n        =   log  2.         subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n           d   n       n      n          2.     \limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{\log d(n)}{\log n/\log\log n}=\log 2.
