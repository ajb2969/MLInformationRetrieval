Displaced Poisson distribution

In statistics, the displaced Poisson, also known as the hyper-Poisson distribution, is a generalization of the Poisson distribution. The probability mass function is



where 
 
 
 
  and r is a new parameter; the Poisson distribution is recovered at r = 0. Here 
 
 
 
  is the incomplete gamma function and s is the integral part of r. The motivation given by Staff1 is that the ratio of successive probabilities in the Poisson distribution (that is 
 
 
 
 ) is given by 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  and the displaced Poisson generalizes this ratio to 
 
 
 
 .
