   Weeks manifold      Weeks manifold   In mathematics , the Weeks manifold , sometimes called the Fomenko–Matveev–Weeks manifold , is a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold obtained by (5, 2) and (5, 1) Dehn surgeries on the Whitehead link . It has volume approximately equal to 0.9427... and  showed that it has the smallest volume of any closed orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold. The manifold was independently discovered by  and .  Since the Weeks manifold is an arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifold , its volume can be computed using its arithmetic data and a formula due to A.

The figure eight knot's complement and its sibling have the smallest volume of any orientable, cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold. Thus the Weeks manifold can be obtained by hyperbolic Dehn surgery on one of the two smallest orientable cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  References    .
