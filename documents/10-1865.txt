   Steroid sulfotransferase      Steroid sulfotransferase   In enzymology , a steroid sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + a phenolic steroid   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + steroid O-sulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and phenolic steroid , whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and steroid O-sulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:phenolic-steroid sulfotransferase . This enzyme is also called steroid alcohol sulfotransferase . This enzyme participates in androgen and estrogen metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.8.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
