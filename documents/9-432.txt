Odd number theorem

The odd number theorem is a theorem in strong gravitational lensing which comes directly from differential topology. It says that the number of multiple images produced by a bounded transparent lens must be odd.
In fact, the gravitational lensing is a mapping from image plane to source plane 
 
 
 
 . If we use direction cosines describing the bent light rays, we can write a vector field on 
 
 
 
  plane 
 
 
 
 . However, only in some specific directions 
 
 
 
 
 , will the bent light rays reach the observer, i.e., the images only form where 
 
 
 
 . Then we can directly apply the Poincaré–Hopf theorem

 
 . The index of sources and sinks is +1, and that of saddle points is −1. So the Euler characteristic equals the difference between the number of positive indices 
 
 
 
  and the number of negative indices 
 
 
 
 . For the far field case, there is only one image, i.e., 
 
 
 
 
 . So the total number of images is 
 
 
 
 , i.e., odd. The strict proof needs Uhlenbeck’s Morse theory of null geodesics.
