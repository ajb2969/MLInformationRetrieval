   Action-angle coordinates      Action-angle coordinates   In classical mechanics , action-angle coordinates are a set of canonical coordinates useful in solving many integrable systems . The method of action-angles is useful for obtaining the frequencies of oscillatory or rotational motion without solving the equations of motion . Action-angle coordinates are chiefly used when the Hamilton–Jacobi equations are completely separable. (Hence, the Hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time, i.e., the energy is conserved .) Action-angle variables define an invariant torus , so called because holding the action constant defines the surface of a torus , while the angle variables provide the coordinates on the torus.  The Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization conditions, used to develop quantum mechanics before the advent of wave mechanics , state that the action must be an integral multiple of Planck's constant ; similarly, Einstein 's insight into EBK quantization and the difficulty of quantizing non-integrable systems was expressed in terms of the invariant tori of action-angle coordinates.  Action-angle coordinates are also useful in perturbation theory of Hamiltonian mechanics , especially in determining adiabatic invariants . One of the earliest results from chaos theory , for the non-linear perturbations of dynamical systems with a small number of degrees of freedom is the KAM theorem , which states that the invariant tori are stable under small perturbations.  The use of action-angle variables was central to the solution of the Toda lattice , and to the definition of Lax pairs , or more generally, the idea of the isospectral evolution of a system.  Derivation  Action angles result from a type-2 canonical transformation where the generating function is Hamilton's characteristic function     W   (  𝐪  )       W  𝐪    W(\mathbf{q})   ( not Hamilton's principal function   S   S   S   ). Since the original Hamiltonian does not depend on time explicitly, the new Hamiltonian    K   (  𝐰  ,  𝐉  )       K   𝐰  𝐉     K(\mathbf{w},\mathbf{J})   is merely the old Hamiltonian    H   (  𝐪  ,  𝐩  )       H   𝐪  𝐩     H(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p})   expressed in terms of the new canonical coordinates , which we denote as   𝐰   𝐰   \mathbf{w}   (the action angles , which are the generalized coordinates ) and their new generalized momenta   𝐉   𝐉   \mathbf{J}   . We will not need to solve here for the generating function   W   W   W   itself; instead, we will use it merely as a vehicle for relating the new and old canonical coordinates .  Rather than defining the action angles   𝐰   𝐰   \mathbf{w}   directly, we define instead their generalized momenta, which resemble the classical action for each original generalized coordinate       J  k   ≡   ∮     p  k    d   q  k          subscript  J  k    contour-integral     subscript  p  k   d   subscript  q  k       J_{k}\equiv\oint p_{k}\,dq_{k}     where the integration path is implicitly given by the constant energy function    E  =   E   (   q  k   ,   p  k   )        E    E    subscript  q  k    subscript  p  k       E=E(q_{k},p_{k})   . Since the actual motion is not involved in this integration, these generalized momenta    J  k     subscript  J  k    J_{k}   are constants of the motion, implying that the transformed Hamiltonian   K   K   K   does not depend on the conjugate generalized coordinates     w  k     subscript  w  k    w_{k}           d   d  t     J  k    =  0  =    ∂  K    ∂   w  k               d    d  t     subscript  J  k    0           K      subscript  w  k        \frac{d}{dt}J_{k}=0=\frac{\partial K}{\partial w_{k}}     where the    w  k     subscript  w  k    w_{k}   are given by the typical equation for a type-2 canonical transformation       w  k   ≡    ∂  W    ∂   J  k          subscript  w  k       W      subscript  J  k       w_{k}\equiv\frac{\partial W}{\partial J_{k}}     Hence, the new Hamiltonian    K  =   K   (  𝐉  )        K    K  𝐉     K=K(\mathbf{J})   depends only on the new generalized momenta   𝐉   𝐉   \mathbf{J}   .  The dynamics of the action angles is given by Hamilton's equations        d   d  t     w  k    =    ∂  K    ∂   J  k     ≡    ν  k    (  𝐉  )              d    d  t     subscript  w  k        K      subscript  J  k             subscript  ν  k   𝐉      \frac{d}{dt}w_{k}=\frac{\partial K}{\partial J_{k}}\equiv\nu_{k}(\mathbf{J})     The right-hand side is a constant of the motion (since all the   J   J   J   's are). Hence, the solution is given by       w  k   =     ν  k    (  𝐉  )   t   +   β  k         subscript  w  k        subscript  ν  k   𝐉  t    subscript  β  k      w_{k}=\nu_{k}(\mathbf{J})t+\beta_{k}     where    β  k     subscript  β  k    \beta_{k}   is a constant of integration. In particular, if the original generalized coordinate undergoes an oscillation or rotation of period   T   T   T   , the corresponding action angle    w  k     subscript  w  k    w_{k}   changes by     Δ   w  k    =    ν  k    (  𝐉  )   T         normal-Δ   subscript  w  k       subscript  ν  k   𝐉  T     \Delta w_{k}=\nu_{k}(\mathbf{J})T   .  These     ν  k    (  𝐉  )        subscript  ν  k   𝐉    \nu_{k}(\mathbf{J})   are the frequencies of oscillation/rotation for the original generalized coordinates     q  k     subscript  q  k    q_{k}   . To show this, we integrate the net change in the action angle    w  k     subscript  w  k    w_{k}   over exactly one complete variation (i.e., oscillation or rotation) of its generalized coordinates     q  k     subscript  q  k    q_{k}          Δ   w  k    ≡   ∮      ∂   w  k     ∂   q  k      d   q  k     =   ∮       ∂  2   W     ∂    J  k      ∂   q  k       d   q  k     =    d   d   J  k      ∮      ∂  W    ∂   q  k      d   q  k      =    d   d   J  k      ∮     p  k    d   q  k      =    d   J  k     d   J  k     =  1          normal-Δ   subscript  w  k     contour-integral         subscript  w  k       subscript  q  k     d   subscript  q  k           contour-integral        superscript   2   W        subscript  J  k       subscript  q  k      d   subscript  q  k              d    d   subscript  J  k      contour-integral        W      subscript  q  k     d   subscript  q  k               d    d   subscript  J  k      contour-integral     subscript  p  k   d   subscript  q  k               d   subscript  J  k      d   subscript  J  k          1     \Delta w_{k}\equiv\oint\frac{\partial w_{k}}{\partial q_{k}}\,dq_{k}=\oint%
 \frac{\partial^{2}W}{\partial J_{k}\,\partial q_{k}}\,dq_{k}=\frac{d}{dJ_{k}}%

 _{k}=\frac{dJ_{k}}{dJ_{k}}=1     Setting the two expressions for    Δ   w  k       normal-Δ   subscript  w  k     \Delta w_{k}   equal, we obtain the desired equation        ν  k    (  𝐉  )    =   1  T          subscript  ν  k   𝐉     1  T     \nu_{k}(\mathbf{J})=\frac{1}{T}     The action angles   𝐰   𝐰   \mathbf{w}   are an independent set of generalized coordinates . Thus, in the general case, each original generalized coordinate    q  k     subscript  q  k    q_{k}   can be expressed as a Fourier series in all the action angles       q  k   =    ∑    s  1   =   -  ∞    ∞     ∑    s  2   =   -  ∞    ∞    ⋯    ∑    s  N   =   -  ∞    ∞     A    s  1   ,   s  2   ,  …  ,   s  N    k    e   i  2  π   s  1    w  1      e   i  2  π   s  2    w  2     ⋯   e   i  2  π   s  N    w  N               subscript  q  k     superscript   subscript      subscript  s  1             superscript   subscript      subscript  s  2             normal-⋯    superscript   subscript      subscript  s  N              subscript   superscript  A  k     subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2   normal-…   subscript  s  N      superscript  e    i  2  π   subscript  s  1    subscript  w  1      superscript  e    i  2  π   subscript  s  2    subscript  w  2     normal-⋯   superscript  e    i  2  π   subscript  s  N    subscript  w  N            q_{k}=\sum_{s_{1}=-\infty}^{\infty}\sum_{s_{2}=-\infty}^{\infty}\cdots\sum_{s_%

In most practical cases, however, an original generalized coordinate    q  k     subscript  q  k    q_{k}   will be expressible as a Fourier series in only its own action angles    w  k     subscript  w  k    w_{k}          q  k   =    ∑    s  k   =   -  ∞    ∞    e   i  2  π   s  k    w  k           subscript  q  k     superscript   subscript      subscript  s  k            superscript  e    i  2  π   subscript  s  k    subscript  w  k        q_{k}=\sum_{s_{k}=-\infty}^{\infty}e^{i2\pi s_{k}w_{k}}     Summary of basic protocol  The general procedure has three steps:   Calculate the new generalized momenta    J  k     subscript  J  k    J_{k}     Express the original Hamiltonian entirely in terms of these variables.  Take the derivatives of the Hamiltonian with respect to these momenta to obtain the frequencies    ν  k     subscript  ν  k    \nu_{k}      Degeneracy  In some cases, the frequencies of two different generalized coordinates are identical, i.e.,     ν  k   =   ν  l        subscript  ν  k    subscript  ν  l     \nu_{k}=\nu_{l}   for    k  ≠  l      k  l    k\neq l   . In such cases, the motion is called degenerate .  Degenerate motion signals that there are additional general conserved quantities; for example, the frequencies of the Kepler problem are degenerate, corresponding to the conservation of the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector .  Degenerate motion also signals that the Hamilton–Jacobi equations are completely separable in more than one coordinate system; for example, the Kepler problem is completely separable in both spherical coordinates and parabolic coordinates .
