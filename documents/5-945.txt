   Disjoint union (topology)      Disjoint union (topology)   In general topology and related areas of mathematics , the disjoint union (also called the direct sum , free union , free sum , topological sum , or coproduct ) of a family of topological spaces is a space formed by equipping the disjoint union of the underlying sets with a natural topology called the disjoint union topology . Roughly speaking, two or more spaces may be considered together, each looking as it would alone.  The name coproduct originates from the fact that the disjoint union is the categorical dual of the product space construction.  Definition  Let { X i : i ∈ I } be a family of topological spaces indexed by I . Let      X  =    ∐  i    X  i        X    subscript  coproduct  i    subscript  X  i      X=\coprod_{i}X_{i}   be the disjoint union of the underlying sets. For each i in I , let       φ  i   :    X  i   →   X       normal-:   subscript  φ  i    normal-→   subscript  X  i   X     \varphi_{i}:X_{i}\to X\,   be the canonical injection (defined by      φ  i    (  x  )    =   (  x  ,  i  )          subscript  φ  i   x    x  i     \varphi_{i}(x)=(x,i)   ). The disjoint union topology on X is defined as the finest topology on X for which the canonical injections {φ i } are continuous .  Explicitly, the disjoint union topology can be described as follows. A subset U of X is open in X  if and only if its preimage      φ  i   -  1     (  U  )        superscript   subscript  φ  i     1    U    \varphi_{i}^{-1}(U)   is open in X i for each i ∈ I .  Yet another formulation is that a subset V of X is open relative to X  iff its intersection with X i is open relative to X i for each i .  Properties  The disjoint union space X , together with the canonical injections, can be characterized by the following universal property : If Y is a topological space, and f i : X i → Y is a continuous map for each i ∈ I , then there exists precisely one continuous map f : X → Y such that the following set of diagrams commute :  This shows that the disjoint union is the coproduct in the category of topological spaces . It follows from the above universal property that a map f : X → Y is continuous iff  f i = f o φ i is continuous for all i in I .  In addition to being continuous, the canonical injections φ i : X i → X are open and closed maps . It follows that the injections are topological embeddings so that each X i may be canonically thought of as a subspace of X .  Examples  If each X i is homeomorphic to a fixed space A , then the disjoint union X will be homeomorphic to A × I where I is given the discrete topology .  Preservation of topological properties   every disjoint union of discrete spaces is discrete  Separation   every disjoint union of T 0 spaces is T 0  every disjoint union of T 1 spaces is T 1  every disjoint union of Hausdorff spaces is Hausdorff   Connectedness   the disjoint union of two or more nonempty topological spaces is disconnected    See also   product topology , the dual construction  subspace topology and its dual quotient topology  topological union , a generalization to the case where the pieces are not disjoint   "  Category:General topology
