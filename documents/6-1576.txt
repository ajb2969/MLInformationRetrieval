   Dependence relation      Dependence relation   In mathematics , a dependence relation is a binary relation which generalizes the relation of linear dependence .  Let   X   X   X   be a set . A (binary) relation   ◁   normal-◁   \triangleleft   between an element   a   a   a   of   X   X   X   and a subset    S   S   S   of   X   X   X   is called a dependence relation , written    a  ◁  S     normal-◁  a  S    a\triangleleft S   , if it satisfies the following properties:   if    a  ∈  S      a  S    a\in S   , then    a  ◁  S     normal-◁  a  S    a\triangleleft S   ;  if    a  ◁  S     normal-◁  a  S    a\triangleleft S   , then there is a finite subset    S  0     subscript  S  0    S_{0}   of   S   S   S   , such that    a  ◁   S  0      normal-◁  a   subscript  S  0     a\triangleleft S_{0}   ;  if   T   T   T   is a subset of   X   X   X   such that    b  ∈  S      b  S    b\in S   implies    b  ◁  T     normal-◁  b  T    b\triangleleft T   , then    a  ◁  S     normal-◁  a  S    a\triangleleft S   implies    a  ◁  T     normal-◁  a  T    a\triangleleft T   ;  if    a  ◁  S     normal-◁  a  S    a\triangleleft S   but      a       ◁  S   -   {  b  }        normal-◁    a      S    b     a\not\!\triangleleft S-\{b\}   for some    b  ∈  S      b  S    b\in S   , then     b  ◁   (   S  -   {  b  }    )    ∪   {  a  }        normal-◁  b    S   b      a     b\triangleleft(S-\{b\})\cup\{a\}   .   Given a dependence relation    ◁   normal-◁   \triangleleft   on   X   X   X   , a subset   S   S   S   of   X   X   X   is said to be independent if      a       ◁  S   -   {  a  }        normal-◁    a      S    a     a\not\!\triangleleft S-\{a\}   for all     a  ∈  S   .      a  S    a\in S.   If    S  ⊆  T      S  T    S\subseteq T   , then   S   S   S   is said to span    T   T   T   if    t  ◁  S     normal-◁  t  S    t\triangleleft S   for every     t  ∈  T   .      t  T    t\in T.      S   S   S   is said to be a basis of   X   X   X   if   S   S   S   is independent and   S   S   S    spans     X  .    X   X.     Remark. If   X   X   X   is a non-empty set with a dependence relation   ◁   normal-◁   \triangleleft   , then   X   X   X   always has a basis with respect to    ◁  .    normal-◁   \triangleleft.   Furthermore, any two bases of   X   X   X   have the same cardinality .  Examples   Let   V   V   V   be a vector space over a field     F  .    F   F.   The relation   ◁   normal-◁   \triangleleft   , defined by    υ  ◁  S     normal-◁  υ  S    \upsilon\triangleleft S   if   υ   υ   \upsilon   is in the subspace spanned by   S   S   S   , is a dependence relation. This is equivalent to the definition of linear dependence .  Let   K   K   K   be a field extension of    F  .    F   F.   Define   ◁   normal-◁   \triangleleft   by    α  ◁  S     normal-◁  α  S    \alpha\triangleleft S   if   α   α   \alpha   is algebraic over     F   (  S  )    .      F  S    F(S).   Then   ◁   normal-◁   \triangleleft   is a dependence relation. This is equivalent to the definition of algebraic dependence .
