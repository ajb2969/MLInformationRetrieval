Dependence relation

In mathematics, a dependence relation is a binary relation which generalizes the relation of linear dependence.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a set. A (binary) relation 
 
 
 
  between an element 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  and a subset

 
  of 
 
 
 
  is called a dependence relation, written 
 
 
 
 , if it satisfies the following properties:

if 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 ;
if 
 
 
 
 , then there is a finite subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
 ;
if 
 
 
 
  is a subset of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  implies 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  implies 
 
 
 
 ;
if 
 
 
 
  but 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .

Given a dependence relation

 
  on 
 
 
 
 , a subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is said to be independent if 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is said to span

 
  if 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 

 
  is said to be a basis of 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  is independent and 
 
 
spans


Remark. If 
 
 
 
  is a non-empty set with a dependence relation 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  always has a basis with respect to 
 
 
 
  Furthermore, any two bases of 
 
 
 
  have the same cardinality.
Examples

Let 
 
 
 
  be a vector space over a field

 
  The relation 
 
 
 
 , defined by 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  is in the subspace spanned by 
 
 
 
 , is a dependence relation. This is equivalent to the definition of linear dependence.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a field extension of 
 
 
 
  Define 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  is algebraic over 
 
 
 
  Then 
 
 
 
  is a dependence relation. This is equivalent to the definition of algebraic dependence.
