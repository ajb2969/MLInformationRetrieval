   Sackur–Tetrode equation      Sackur–Tetrode equation   The Sackur–Tetrode equation is an expression for the entropy of a monatomic classical ideal gas which incorporates quantum considerations which give a more detailed description of its regime of validity.  The Sackur–Tetrode equation is named for Hugo Martin Tetrode 1 (1895–1931) and Otto Sackur Sackur published his findings in the following series of papers:   O. Sackur (1911) "Die Anwendung der kinetischen Theorie der Gase auf chemische Probleme" (The application of the kinetic theory of gases to chemical problems), Annalen der Physik , 36 : 958 - 980.  O. Sackur, "Die Bedeutung des elementaren Wirkungsquantums für die Gastheorie und die Berechnung der chemischen Konstanten" (The significance of the elementary quantum of action to gas theory and the calculation of the chemical constant), Festschrift W. Nernst zu seinem 25jährigen Doktorjubiläum gewidmet von seinen Schülern (Halle an der Salle, Germany: Wilhelm Knapp, 1912), pages 405 - 423.  O. Sackur (1913) "Die universelle Bedeutung des sog. elementaren Wirkungsquantums" (The universal significance of the so-called elementary quantum of action), Annalen der Physik  40 : 67 - 86. (1880–1914), who developed it independently as a solution of Boltzmann's gas statistics and entropy equations, at about the same time in 1912.   Formula  The Sackur–Tetrode equation is written:      S  =   k  N   (    ln   [    V  N     (     4  π  m    3   h  2      U  N    )    3  /  2     ]    +   5  2    )        S    k  N          V  N    superscript        4  π  m     3   superscript  h  2       U  N      3  2        5  2       S=kN\left(\ln\left[\frac{V}{N}\left(\frac{4\pi m}{3h^{2}}\frac{U}{N}\right)^{3%
 /2}\right]+{\frac{5}{2}}\right)     where V is the volume of the gas, N is the number of particles in the gas, U is the internal energy of the gas, k is Boltzmann's constant , m is the mass of a gas particle, h is Planck's constant and ln() is the natural logarithm . See Gibbs paradox for a derivation of the Sackur–Tetrode equation. See also the ideal gas article for the constraints placed upon the entropy of an ideal gas by thermodynamics alone.  The Sackur–Tetrode equation can also be conveniently expressed in terms of the thermal wavelength    Λ   normal-Λ   \Lambda   .        S   k  N    =    ln   [   V   N   Λ  3     ]    +   5  2     .        S    k  N          V    N   superscript  normal-Λ  3        5  2      \frac{S}{kN}=\ln\left[\frac{V}{N\Lambda^{3}}\right]+\frac{5}{2}.     Note that the assumption was made that the gas is in the classical regime, and is described by Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics (with "correct Boltzmann counting"). From the definition of the thermal wavelength , this means the Sackur–Tetrode equation is only valid for       V   N   Λ  3     ≫  1     much-greater-than    V    N   superscript  normal-Λ  3     1    \frac{V}{N\Lambda^{3}}\gg 1     and in fact, the entropy predicted by the Sackur–Tetrode equation approaches negative infinity as the temperature approaches zero.  Sackur–Tetrode constant  The Sackur–Tetrode constant , written S 0 / R , is equal to S/kN evaluated at a temperature of T = 1 kelvin , at standard pressure (100 kPa or 101.325 kPa, to be specified), for one mole of an ideal gas composed of particles of mass equal to one atomic mass unit ( m u = ). Its 2010 CODATA recommended value is: 2   S 0 / R = −1.151 7078(23) for p o = 100 kPa  S 0 / R = −1.164 8708(23) for p o = 101.325 kPa.
