   Volodin space      Volodin space   In mathematics , more specifically in topology , the Volodin space    X   X   X   of a ring  R is a subspace of the classifying space     B  G  L   (  R  )       B  G  L  R    BGL(R)   given by      X  =    ⋃   n  ,  σ     B   (    U  n     (  R  )   σ    )         X    subscript    n  σ      B     subscript  U  n    superscript  R  σ        X=\bigcup_{n,\sigma}B(U_{n}(R)^{\sigma})   where      U  n    (  R  )    ⊂   G   L  n    (  R  )           subscript  U  n   R     G   subscript  L  n   R     U_{n}(R)\subset GL_{n}(R)   is the subgroup of upper triangular matrices with 1's on the diagonal (i.e., the unipotent radical of the standard Borel) and   σ   σ   \sigma   a permutation matrix thought of as an element in     G   L  n    (  R  )       G   subscript  L  n   R    GL_{n}(R)    and acting (superscript) by conjugation. 1 The space is acyclic and the fundamental group      π  1   X       subscript  π  1   X    \pi_{1}X   is the Steinberg group     St   (  R  )      St  R    \operatorname{St}(R)   of R . In fact, Suslin's 1981 paper 2 explains that X yields a model for the Quillen's plus-construction       B  G  L   (  R  )    /  X   ≃   B  G   L  +    (  R  )       similar-to-or-equals      B  G  L  R   X     B  G   superscript  L    R     BGL(R)/X\simeq BGL^{+}(R)   in algebraic K-theory .
