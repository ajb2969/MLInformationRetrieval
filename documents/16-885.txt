Volodin space

In mathematics, more specifically in topology, the Volodin space

 
  of a ring R is a subspace of the classifying space

 
  given by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the subgroup of upper triangular matrices with 1's on the diagonal (i.e., the unipotent radical of the standard Borel) and 
 
 
 
  a permutation matrix thought of as an element in 

 and acting (superscript) by conjugation.1 The space is acyclic and the fundamental group

 
  is the Steinberg group

 
  of R. In fact, Suslin's 1981 paper 2 explains that X yields a model for the Quillen's plus-construction

 
  in algebraic K-theory.
