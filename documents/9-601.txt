Boyle temperature

In thermodynamics, the Boyle temperature is the temperature at which a non ideal gas behaves most like an ideal gas. At Boyle temperature, set the compressibility factor 
 
 
 
  to 1, and one can obtain



Where a and b are van der Waals parameters.



This is the virial equation of state and describes a real gas. The Boyle temperature is formally defined as the temperature for which the second virial coefficient, 
 
 
 
  becomes 0. It is at this temperature that the attractive forces and the repulsive forces acting on the gas particles balance out. Since higher order virial coefficients are generally much smaller than the second coefficient, the gas tends to behave as an ideal gas over a wider range of pressures when the temperature reaches the Boyle temperature (or when 
 
 
 
  or p are minimized).
In any case, when the pressures are low, the second virial coefficient will be the only relevant one because the remaining concern terms of higher order on the pressure. We then have



where 
 
 
 
  is the compressibility factor
