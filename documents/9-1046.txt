   P-wave modulus      P-wave modulus   In linear elasticity , the P-wave modulus    M   M   M   , also known as the longitudinal modulus or the constrained modulus , is one of the elastic moduli available to describe isotropic homogeneous materials.  It is defined as the ratio of axial stress to axial strain in a uniaxial strain state       σ   z  z    =   M   ϵ   z  z          subscript  σ    z  z      M   subscript  ϵ    z  z       \sigma_{zz}=M\epsilon_{zz}   where all the other strains    ϵ    *  *      subscript  ϵ    absent      \epsilon_{**}   are zero.  This is equivalent to stating that      M  =   ρ   V  P  2        M    ρ   superscript   subscript  V  normal-P   2      M=\rho V_{\mathrm{P}}^{2}   where V P is the velocity of a P-wave .
