P-wave modulus




P-wave modulus

In linear elasticity, the P-wave modulus

 
 , also known as the longitudinal modulus or the constrained modulus, is one of the elastic moduli available to describe isotropic homogeneous materials.
It is defined as the ratio of axial stress to axial strain in a uniaxial strain state


 
  where all the other strains 
 
 
 
  are zero.
This is equivalent to stating that


 
  where VP is the velocity of a P-wave.
