   Amenable Banach algebra      Amenable Banach algebra   A Banach algebra , A , is amenable if all bounded  derivations from A into dual  Banach A -bimodules are inner (that is of the form     a  ↦  a   .   x  -  x   .  a     formulae-sequence   maps-to  a  a     x  x   a    a\mapsto a.x-x.a   for some   x   x   x   in the dual module).  An equivalent characterization is that A is amenable if and only if it has a virtual diagonal .  Examples   If A is a group algebra      L  1    (  G  )        superscript  L  1   G    L^{1}(G)   for some locally compact group  G then A is amenable if and only if G is amenable .  If A is a C*-algebra then A is amenable if and only if it is nuclear .  If A is a uniform algebra on a compact  Hausdorff space then A is amenable if and only if it is trivial (i.e. the algebra C(X) of all continuous  complex  functions on X ).  If A is amenable and there is a continuous algebra homomorphism   θ   θ   \theta   from A to another Banach algebra, then the closure of     θ   (  A  )    ¯     normal-¯    θ  A     \overline{\theta(A)}   is amenable.
