Amenable Banach algebra

A Banach algebra, A, is amenable if all bounded derivations from A into dual Banach A-bimodules are inner (that is of the form 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
  in the dual module).
An equivalent characterization is that A is amenable if and only if it has a virtual diagonal.
Examples

If A is a group algebra

 
  for some locally compact group G then A is amenable if and only if G is amenable.
If A is a C*-algebra then A is amenable if and only if it is nuclear.
If A is a uniform algebra on a compact Hausdorff space then A is amenable if and only if it is trivial (i.e. the algebra C(X) of all continuous complex functions on X).
If A is amenable and there is a continuous algebra homomorphism 
 
 
 
  from A to another Banach algebra, then the closure of 
 
 
 
  is amenable.
