   UDP-glucose—hexose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase      UDP-glucose—hexose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase   In enzymology , an UDP-glucose—hexose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + alpha-D-galactose 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate + UDP-galactose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and alpha-D-galactose 1-phosphate , whereas its two products are alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate and UDP-galactose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:alpha-D-galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase . Other names in common use include uridyl transferase , hexose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase , uridyltransferase , and hexose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase . This enzyme participates in galactose metabolism and nucleotide sugars metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
