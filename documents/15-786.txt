Momilactone-A synthase

Momilactone-A synthase (, momilactone A synthase, OsMAS) is an enzyme with system name 3beta-hydroxy-9beta-pimara-7,15-diene-19,6beta-olide:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

3beta-hydroxy-9beta-pimara-7,15-diene-19,6beta-olide + NAD(P)+

 
  momilactone A + NAD(P)H + H+


The rice phytoalexin momilactone A is a diterpenoid secondary metabolite that is involved in the defense mechanism of the plant. Momilactone A is produced in response to attack by a pathogen through the perception of elicitor signal molecules such as chitin oligosaccharide, or after exposure to UV irradiation.
