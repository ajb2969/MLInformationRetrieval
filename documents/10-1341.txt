   Cyanocobalamin reductase (cyanide-eliminating)      Cyanocobalamin reductase (cyanide-eliminating)   In enzymology , a cyanocobalamin reductase (cyanide-eliminating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cob(I)alamin + cyanide + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cyanocob(III)alamin + NADPH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are cob(I)alamin , cyanide , and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are cyanocob(III)alamin , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those which oxidize metal ions, and use NAD+ or NADP+ as an electron acceptor (for that oxidization reaction). The systematic name of this enzyme class is cob(I)alamin, cyanide:NADP+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include cyanocobalamin reductase , cyanocobalamin reductase (NADPH, cyanide-eliminating) , cyanocobalamin reductase (NADPH , CN-eliminating) , and NADPH:cyanocob(III)alamin oxidoreductase (cyanide-eliminating) . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism . It employs one cofactor , FAD .
