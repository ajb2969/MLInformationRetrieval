   Daraf      Daraf   The daraf is the unit of electrical elastance (symbol: F −1 ), the voltage across a capacitor after accepting an electric charge of 1 coulomb ; it is the reciprocal of the farad . Proposed by Arthur Edwin Kennelly in 1936 as a backwards spelling ( semordnilap ) of farad, the term daraf is not recognized by the SI (the preferred term being reciprocal farad ).        1    F   -  1     =     1   V     1   C    =     1   Ω     1   s            1   superscript  F    1         1  V     1  C             1  normal-Ω     1  s       1~{}\text{F}^{-1}=\frac{1~{}\text{V}}{1~{}\text{C}}=\frac{1~{}\Omega}{1~{}%
