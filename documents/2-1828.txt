Daraf




Daraf

The daraf is the unit of electrical elastance (symbol: Fâˆ’1), the voltage across a capacitor after accepting an electric charge of 1 coulomb; it is the reciprocal of the farad. Proposed by Arthur Edwin Kennelly in 1936 as a backwards spelling (semordnilap) of farad, the term daraf is not recognized by the SI (the preferred term being reciprocal farad).
