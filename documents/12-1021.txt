   Milnor number      Milnor number   In mathematics, and particularly singularity theory , the Milnor number , named after John Milnor , is an invariant of a function germ.  If f is a complex-valued holomorphic function germ then the Milnor number of f , denoted μ ( f ), is either an integer greater than or equal to zero , or it is infinite . It can be considered both a geometric  invariant and an algebraic invariant. This is why it plays an important role in algebraic geometry and singularity theory .  Geometric interpretation  Consider a holomorphic complex  function germ  f :       f  :    (   ℂ  n   ,  0  )   →   (  ℂ  ,  0  )     .     normal-:  f   normal-→    superscript  ℂ  n   0    ℂ  0      f:(\mathbb{C}^{n},0)\to(\mathbb{C},0)\ .   Thus for an n -tuple of complex numbers      z  1   ,  …  ,   z  n       subscript  z  1   normal-…   subscript  z  n     z_{1},\ldots,z_{n}   we get a complex number      f   (   z  1   ,  …  ,   z  n   )    .      f    subscript  z  1   normal-…   subscript  z  n      f(z_{1},\ldots,z_{n}).   We shall write     z  :=   (   z  1   ,  …  ,   z  n   )    .     assign  z    subscript  z  1   normal-…   subscript  z  n      z:=(z_{1},\ldots,z_{n}).     We say that f is singular at a point     z  0   ∈   ℂ  n        subscript  z  0    superscript  ℂ  n     z_{0}\in\mathbb{C}^{n}   if the first order partial derivatives       ∂  f   /   ∂   z  1     ,  …  ,    ∂  f   /   ∂   z  n            f      subscript  z  1     normal-…      f      subscript  z  n       \partial f/\partial z_{1},\ldots,\partial f/\partial z_{n}   are all zero at    z  =   z  0       z   subscript  z  0     z=z_{0}   . As the name might suggest: we say that a singular point     z  0   ∈   ℂ  n        subscript  z  0    superscript  ℂ  n     z_{0}\in\mathbb{C}^{n}   is isolated if there exists a sufficiently small neighbourhood     U  ⊂   ℂ  n       U   superscript  ℂ  n     U\subset\mathbb{C}^{n}   of    z  0     subscript  z  0    z_{0}   such that    z  0     subscript  z  0    z_{0}   is the only singular point in U . We say that a point is a degenerate singular point, or that f has a degenerate singularity, at     z  0   ∈   ℂ  n        subscript  z  0    superscript  ℂ  n     z_{0}\in\mathbb{C}^{n}   if    z  0     subscript  z  0    z_{0}   is a singular point and the Hessian matrix of all second order partial derivatives has zero determinant at    z  0     subscript  z  0    z_{0}   :       det    (     ∂  2   f     ∂   z  i     ∂   z  j      )    1  ≤  i  ≤  j  ≤  n    z  =   z  0      =  0.         superscript   subscript      superscript   2   f        subscript  z  i       subscript  z  j          1  i       j       n       z   subscript  z  0      0.    \det\left(\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial z_{i}\partial z_{j}}\right)_{1\leq i%
 \leq j\leq n}^{z=z_{0}}=0.     We assume that f has a degenerate singularity at 0. We can speak about the multiplicity of this degenerate singularity by thinking about how many points are infinitesimally glued. If we now perturb the image of f in a certain stable way the isolated degenerate singularity at 0 will split up into other isolated singularities which are non-degenerate! The number of such isolated non-degenerate singularities will be the number of points that have been infinitesimally glued.  Precisely, we take another function germ g which is non-singular at the origin and consider the new function germ h := f + εg where ε is very small. When ε = 0 then h = f . The function h is called the morsification of f . It is very difficult to compute the singularities of h , and indeed it may be computationally impossible. This number of points that have been infinitesimally glued, this local multiplicity of f , is exactly the Milnor number of f .  Algebraic interpretation  Using some algebraic techniques we can calculate the Milnor number of f effortlessly. By   𝒪   𝒪   \mathcal{O}   denote the ring of function germs     (   ℂ  n   ,  0  )   →   (  ℂ  ,  0  )      normal-→    superscript  ℂ  n   0    ℂ  0     (\mathbb{C}^{n},0)\to(\mathbb{C},0)   . By    J  f     subscript  J  f    J_{f}   denote the Jacobian ideal of f :       J  f   :=   ⟨    ∂  f    ∂   z  i     :  1  ≤  i  ≤  n  ⟩   .     fragments   subscript  J  f   assign   fragments  normal-⟨      f      subscript  z  i     normal-:  1   i   n  normal-⟩   normal-.    J_{f}:=\left\langle\frac{\partial f}{\partial z_{i}}:1\leq i\leq n\right\rangle.   The local algebra of f is then given by the quotient  algebra        𝒜  f   :=   𝒪  /   J  f     .     assign   subscript  𝒜  f     𝒪   subscript  J  f      \mathcal{A}_{f}:=\mathcal{O}/J_{f}.   Notice that this quotient space will actually be a vector space , although it may not be finite-dimensional. The Milnor number is then equal to the complex dimension of the local algebra:        μ   (  f  )    =    dim  ℂ     𝒜  f      .        μ  f     subscript  dimension  ℂ    subscript  𝒜  f      \mu(f)=\dim_{\mathbb{C}}\mathcal{A}_{f}\ .   It follows from Hilbert's Nullstellensatz that    μ   (  f  )       μ  f    \mu(f)   is finite if and only if the origin is an isolated critical point of f ; that is, there is a neighbourhood of 0 in    ℂ  n     superscript  ℂ  n    \mathbb{C}^{n}   such that the only critical point of f inside that neighbourhood is at 0.  Examples  Here we give some worked examples in two variables. Working with only one is too simple and does not give a feel for the techniques, whereas working with three variables can be quite tricky. Two is a nice number. Also we stick to polynomials. If f is only holomorphic and not a polynomial, then we could have worked with the power series expansion of f .  1  Consider a function germ with a non-degenerate singularity at 0, say     f   (  x  ,  y  )    =    x  2   +   y  2          f   x  y       superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2      f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}   . The Jacobian ideal is just     ⟨   2  x   ,   2  y   ⟩   =   ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩          2  x     2  y     x  y     \langle 2x,2y\rangle=\langle x,y\rangle   . We next compute the local algebra:        𝒜  f   =   𝒪  /   ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩    =   ⟨  1  ⟩    .         subscript  𝒜  f     𝒪   x  y          delimited-⟨⟩  1      \mathcal{A}_{f}=\mathcal{O}/\langle x,y\rangle=\langle 1\rangle.   To see why this is true we can use Hadamard's lemma which says that we can write any function    h  ∈  𝒪      h  𝒪    h\in\mathcal{O}   as       h   (  x  ,  y  )    =   k  +   x   h  1    (  x  ,  y  )    +   y   h  2    (  x  ,  y  )           h   x  y      k    x   subscript  h  1    x  y      y   subscript  h  2    x  y       h(x,y)=k+xh_{1}(x,y)+yh_{2}(x,y)   for some constant k and functions    h  1     subscript  h  1    h_{1}   and    h  2     subscript  h  2    h_{2}   in   𝒪   𝒪   \mathcal{O}   (where either    h  1     subscript  h  1    h_{1}   or    h  2     subscript  h  2    h_{2}   or both may be exactly zero). So, modulo functional multiples of x and y , we can write h as a constant. The space of constant functions is spanned by 1, hence     𝒜  f   =   ⟨  1  ⟩        subscript  𝒜  f    delimited-⟨⟩  1     \mathcal{A}_{f}=\langle 1\rangle     It follows that μ ( f ) = 1. It is easy to check that for any function germ g with a non-degenerate singularity at 0 we get μ ( g ) = 1.  Note that applying this method to a non-singular function germ g we get μ ( g ) = 0.  2  Let     f   (  x  ,  y  )    =    x  3   +   x   y  2           f   x  y       superscript  x  3     x   superscript  y  2       f(x,y)=x^{3}+xy^{2}   , then        𝒜  f   =   𝒪  /   ⟨    3   x  2    +   y  2    ,   x  y   ⟩    =   ⟨  1  ,  x  ,  y  ,   x  2   ⟩    .         subscript  𝒜  f     𝒪       3   superscript  x  2     superscript  y  2      x  y           1  x  y   superscript  x  2       \mathcal{A}_{f}=\mathcal{O}/\langle 3x^{2}+y^{2},xy\rangle=\langle 1,x,y,x^{2}\rangle.   So in this case     μ   (  f  )    =  4        μ  f   4    \mu(f)=4   .  3  One can show that if     f   (  x  ,  y  )    =     x  2    y  2    +   y  3          f   x  y         superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2     superscript  y  3      f(x,y)=x^{2}y^{2}+y^{3}   then      μ   (  f  )    =  ∞   .        μ  f      \mu(f)=\infty.     This can be explained by the fact that f is singular at every point of the x -axis.  Versal Deformations  Let f have finite Milnor number μ , and let     g  1   ,  …  ,   g  μ       subscript  g  1   normal-…   subscript  g  μ     g_{1},\ldots,g_{\mu}   be a basis for the local algebra, considered as a vector space. Then a miniversal deformation of f is given by       F  :    (    ℂ  n   ×   ℂ  μ    ,  0  )   →   (  ℂ  ,  0  )     ,     normal-:  F   normal-→      superscript  ℂ  n    superscript  ℂ  μ    0    ℂ  0      F:(\mathbb{C}^{n}\times\mathbb{C}^{\mu},0)\to(\mathbb{C},0),           F   (  z  ,  a  )    :=    f   (  z  )    +    a  1    g  1    (  z  )    +  ⋯  +    a  μ    g  μ    (  z  )      ,     assign    F   z  a        f  z      subscript  a  1    subscript  g  1   z   normal-⋯     subscript  a  μ    subscript  g  μ   z      F(z,a):=f(z)+a_{1}g_{1}(z)+\cdots+a_{\mu}g_{\mu}(z),   where     (   a  1   ,  …  ,   a  μ   )   ∈   ℂ  μ         subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  μ     superscript  ℂ  μ     (a_{1},\dots,a_{\mu})\in\mathbb{C}^{\mu}   . These deformations (or unfoldings ) are of great interest in much of science.  Invariance  We can collect function germs together to construct equivalence classes . One standard equivalence is A -equivalence . We say that two function germs     f  ,  g   :    (   ℂ  n   ,  0  )   →   (  ℂ  ,  0  )       normal-:   f  g    normal-→    superscript  ℂ  n   0    ℂ  0      f,g:(\mathbb{C}^{n},0)\to(\mathbb{C},0)   are A -equivalent if there exist diffeomorphism germs    ϕ  :    (   ℂ  n   ,  0  )   →   (   ℂ  n   ,  0  )       normal-:  ϕ   normal-→    superscript  ℂ  n   0     superscript  ℂ  n   0      \phi:(\mathbb{C}^{n},0)\to(\mathbb{C}^{n},0)   and    ψ  :    (  ℂ  ,  0  )   →   (  ℂ  ,  0  )       normal-:  ψ   normal-→   ℂ  0    ℂ  0      \psi:(\mathbb{C},0)\to(\mathbb{C},0)   such that     f  ∘  ϕ   =   ψ  ∘  g         f  ϕ     ψ  g     f\circ\phi=\psi\circ g   : there exists a diffeomorphic change of variable in both domain and range which takes f to g .  The Milnor number does not offer a complete invariant for function germs. We do have that if f and g are A -equivalent then μ ( f ) = μ ( g ). The converse is false: there exist function germs f and g with μ ( f ) = μ ( g ) which are not A -equivalent. To see this consider     f   (  x  ,  y  )    =    x  3   +   y  3          f   x  y       superscript  x  3    superscript  y  3      f(x,y)=x^{3}+y^{3}   and     g   (  x  ,  y  )    =    x  2   +   y  5          g   x  y       superscript  x  2    superscript  y  5      g(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{5}   . We have     μ   (  f  )    =   μ   (  g  )    =  4          μ  f     μ  g        4     \mu(f)=\mu(g)=4   but f and g are clearly not A -equivalent since the Hessian matrix of f is equal to zero while that of g is not (and the rank of the Hessian is an A -invariant, as is easy to see).
