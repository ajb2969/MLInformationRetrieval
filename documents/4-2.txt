   Bohr compactification      Bohr compactification   In mathematics , the Bohr compactification of a topological group  G is a compact Hausdorff topological group H that may be canonically associated to G . Its importance lies in the reduction of the theory of uniformly almost periodic functions on G to the theory of continuous functions on H . The concept is named after Harald Bohr who pioneered the study of almost periodic functions , on the real line .  Definitions and basic properties  Given a topological group  G , the Bohr compactification of G is a compact Hausdorff topological group Bohr ( G ) and a continuous homomorphism   b : G → Bohr ( G )   which is universal with respect to homomorphisms into compact Hausdorff groups; this means that if K is another compact Hausdorff topological group and   f : G → K    is a continuous homomorphism, then there is a unique continuous homomorphism   Bohr ( f ): Bohr ( G ) → K    such that f = Bohr ( f ) ∘ b .  Theorem . The Bohr compactification exists and is unique up to isomorphism.  We will denote the Bohr compactification of G by Bohr ( G ) and the canonical map by       𝐛  :   G  →   𝐁𝐨𝐡𝐫   (  G  )      .     normal-:  𝐛   normal-→  G    𝐁𝐨𝐡𝐫  G      \mathbf{b}:G\rightarrow\mathbf{Bohr}(G).     The correspondence G ↦ Bohr ( G ) defines a covariant functor on the category of topological groups and continuous homomorphisms.  The Bohr compactification is intimately connected to the finite-dimensional unitary representation theory of a topological group. The kernel of b consists exactly of those elements of G which cannot be separated from the identity of G by finite-dimensional unitary representations.  The Bohr compactification also reduces many problems in the theory of almost periodic functions on topological groups to that of functions on compact groups.  A bounded continuous complex-valued function f on a topological group G is uniformly almost periodic if and only if the set of right translates g f where        [   f   g    ]    (  x  )    =   f   (    g   -  1    ⋅  x   )           delimited-[]   subscript  f  g    x     f   normal-⋅   superscript  g    1    x      [{}_{g}f](x)=f(g^{-1}\cdot x)     is relatively compact in the uniform topology as g varies through G .  Theorem . A bounded continuous complex-valued function f on G is uniformly almost periodic if and only if there is a continuous function f 1 on Bohr ( G ) (which is uniquely determined) such that       f  =    f  1   ∘  𝐛    .      f     subscript  f  1   𝐛     f=f_{1}\circ\mathbf{b}.     Maximally almost periodic groups  Topological groups for which the Bohr compactification mapping is injective are called maximally almost periodic (or MAP groups). In the case G is a locally compact connected group, MAP groups are completely characterized: They are precisely products of compact groups with vector groups of finite dimension.
