   Log sum inequality      Log sum inequality   __NOTOC__ In mathematics, the log sum inequality is an inequality which is useful for proving several theorems in information theory .  Statement  Let $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ and $b_1,\ldots,b_n$ be nonnegative numbers. Denote the sum of all $a_i\;$ s by $a$ and the sum of all $b_i\;$ s by $b$ . The log sum inequality states that  $$\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\log\frac{a_i}{b_i}\geq a\log\frac{a}{b},$$  with equality if and only if $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$ are equal for all $i$ .  Proof  Notice that after setting $f(x)=x\log x$ we have  $$\begin{align}
 \sum_{i=1}^n a_i\log\frac{a_i}{b_i} & {} = \sum_{i=1}^n b_i f\left(\frac{a_i}{b_i}\right)
  = b\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{b_i}{b} f\left(\frac{a_i}{b_i}\right) \\
 & {} \geq b f\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{b_i}{b}\frac{a_i}{b_i}\right) = b f\left(\frac{1}{b}\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\right)
 = b f\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) \\
 & {} = a\log\frac{a}{b},
 \end{align}$$ where the inequality follows from Jensen's inequality since $\frac{b_i}{b}\geq 0$ , $\sum_i\frac{b_i}{b}= 1$ , and $f$ is convex.  Applications  The log sum inequality can be used to prove several inequalities in information theory such as Gibbs' inequality or the convexity of Kullback-Leibler divergence .  For example to prove Gibbs' inequality it is enough to substitute $p_i\;$ s for $a_i\;$ s, and $q_i\;$ s for $b_i\;$ s to get  $$D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P\|Q) \equiv \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log_2 \frac{p_i}{q_i} \geq 1\log\frac{1}{1} = 0.$$  Generalizations  The inequality remains valid for $n=\infty$ provided that $a<\infty$ and $b<\infty$ . The proof above holds for any function $g$ such that $f(x)=xg(x)$ is convex, such as all continuous non-decreasing functions. Generalizations to convex functions other than the logarithm is given in CsiszÃ¡r, 2004.  References   T.S. Han, K. Kobayashi, Mathematics of information and coding.
