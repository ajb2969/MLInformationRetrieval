   (a,b)-decomposability      (a,b)-decomposability   In graph theory , the ( a , b )-decomposability of an undirected graph is the existence of a partition of its edges into a + 1 sets, each one of them inducing a forest, except one who induces a graph with maximum degree b . If this graph is also a forest, then we call this a ' F( a , b )-decomposition '.  A graph with arboricity  a is ( a , 0)-decomposable. Every ( a , 0 )-decomposition or ( a , 1 )-decomposition is a F( a , 0 )-decomposition or a F( a , 1 )-decomposition respectively.  Graph Classes   Every planar graph is F(2,4)-decomposable. 1  Every planar graph    G   G   G   with girth at least   g   g   g   is  F(2,0)-decomposable if    g  ≥  4      g  4    g\geq 4   . 2  (1,4)-decomposable if    g  ≥  5      g  5    g\geq 5   . 3  F(1,2)-decomposable if    g  ≥  6      g  6    g\geq 6   . 4  F(1,1)-decomposable if    g  ≥  8      g  8    g\geq 8   , 5 or if every cycle of   G   G   G   is either a triangle or a cycle with at least 8 edges not belonging to a triangle. 6  (1,5)-decomposable if   G   G   G   has no 4-cycles. 7   Every outerplanar graph is F(2,0)-decomposable 8 and (1,3)-decomposable. 9   Notes  References (chronological order)                 "  Category:Graph invariants  Category:Graph theory     , conjectured by .
