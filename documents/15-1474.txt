Glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase

Glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase (, GpgS protein, GPG synthase, glucosylphosphoglycerate synthase) is an enzyme with system name NDP-glucose:3-phospho-D-glycerate 2-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase.123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

NDP-glucose + 3-phospho-D-glycerate 
 
 
 
  NDP + 2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-3-phospho-D-glycerate
 

The enzyme is involved in biosynthesis of 2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glycerate.
