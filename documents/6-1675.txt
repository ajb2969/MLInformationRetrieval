   Leray's theorem      Leray's theorem   In algebraic geometry , Leray's theorem relates abstract sheaf cohomology with Čech cohomology .  Let   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   be a sheaf on a topological space    X   X   X   and   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   an open cover of    X  .    X   X.   If   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   is acyclic on every finite intersection of elements of   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   , then          H  ˇ   q    (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )    =    H  q    (  X  ,  ℱ  )     ,         superscript   normal-ˇ  H   q    𝒰  ℱ       superscript  H  q    X  ℱ      \check{H}^{q}(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{F})=H^{q}(X,\mathcal{F}),     where      H  ˇ   q    (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )        superscript   normal-ˇ  H   q    𝒰  ℱ     \check{H}^{q}(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{F})   is the   q   q   q   -th Čech cohomology group of   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   with respect to the open cover    𝒰  .
