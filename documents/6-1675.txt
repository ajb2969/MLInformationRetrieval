Leray's theorem

In algebraic geometry, Leray's theorem relates abstract sheaf cohomology with Čech cohomology.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a sheaf on a topological space

 
  and 
 
 
 
  an open cover of 
 
 
 
 
  If 
 
 
 
  is acyclic on every finite intersection of elements of 
 
 
 
 , then



where 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
 
 -th Čech cohomology group of 
 
 
 
  with respect to the open cover
