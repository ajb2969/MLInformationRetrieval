   Margulis lemma      Margulis lemma   In mathematics , the Margulis lemma (named after Grigory Margulis ) is a result about discrete subgroups of isometries of a symmetric space (e.g. the hyperbolic n-space ), or more generally a space of non-positive curvature .  Theorem: Let S be a Riemannian symmetric space of non-compact type. There is a positive constant      ϵ  =   ϵ   (  S  )    >  0        ϵ    ϵ  S        0     \epsilon=\epsilon(S)>0     with the following property. Let F be a set of isometries of S . Suppose there is a point x in S such that       d   (   f  ⋅  x   ,  x  )    <  ϵ        d    normal-⋅  f  x   x    ϵ    d(f\cdot x,x)<\epsilon     for all f in F. Assume further that the subgroup   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   generated by F is discrete in Isom( S ). Then   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is virtually nilpotent. More precisely, there exists a subgroup    Γ  0     subscript  normal-Γ  0    \Gamma_{0}   in   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   which is nilpotent of nilpotency class at most r and of index at most N in   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   , where r and N are constants depending on S only.  The constant    ϵ   (  S  )       ϵ  S    \epsilon(S)   is often referred as the Margulis constant .
