   Disjunction introduction      Disjunction introduction   Disjunction introduction or addition (also called or introduction ) 1 2 3 is a simple valid  argument form , an immediate inference and a rule of inference of propositional logic . The rule makes it possible to introduce disjunctions to logical proofs . It is the inference that if P is true, then P or Q must be true.   Socrates is a man.  Therefore, either Socrates is a man or pigs are flying in formation over the English Channel.   The rule can be expressed as:      P    ∴   P  Q        P   therefore  absent    P  Q      \frac{P}{\therefore PQ}     where the rule is that whenever instances of "   P   P   P   " appear on lines of a proof, "    P  Q      P  Q    PQ   " can be placed on a subsequent line.  Disjunction introduction is controversial in paraconsistent logic because in combination with other rules of logic, it leads to explosion (i.e. everything becomes provable). See Tradeoffs in Paraconsistent logic .  Formal notation  The disjunction introduction rule may be written in sequent notation:      P  ⊢   (   P  Q   )      proves  P    P  Q     P\vdash(PQ)     where   ⊢   proves   \vdash   is a metalogical symbol meaning that    P  Q      P  Q    PQ   is a syntactic consequence of   P   P   P   in some logical system ;  and expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:      P  →   (   P  Q   )      normal-→  P    P  Q     P\to(PQ)     where   P   P   P   and   Q   Q   Q   are propositions expressed in some formal system .
