   Augmentation ideal      Augmentation ideal   In algebra , an augmentation ideal is an ideal that can be defined in any group ring . If G is a group and R a commutative ring , there is a ring homomorphism    ε   ε   \varepsilon   , called the augmentation map , from the group ring      R   [  G  ]       R   delimited-[]  G     R[G]     to R , defined by taking a sum      ∑    r  i    g  i           subscript  r  i    subscript  g  i      \sum r_{i}g_{i}     to       ∑   r  i    .       subscript  r  i     \sum r_{i}.     Here r i is an element of R and g i an element of G . The sums are finite, by definition of the group ring. In less formal terms,      ε   (  g  )       ε  g    \varepsilon(g)     is defined as 1 R whatever the element g in G , and   ε   ε   \varepsilon   is then extended to a homomorphism of R - modules in the obvious way. The augmentation ideal is the kernel of   ε   ε   \varepsilon   , and is therefore a two-sided ideal in R [ G ]. It is generated by the differences      g  -   g  ′       g   superscript  g  normal-′     g-g^{\prime}     of group elements.  Furthermore it is also generated by        g  -  1   ,  g   ∈  G         g  1   g   G    g-1,g\in G     which is a basis for the augmentation ideal as a free R module.  For R and G as above, the group ring R [ G ] is an example of an augmented  R -algebra . Such an algebra comes equipped with a ring homomorphism to R . The kernel of this homomorphism is the augmentation ideal of the algebra.  Another class of examples of augmentation ideal can be the kernel of the counit    ε   ε   \varepsilon   of any Hopf algebra .  The augmentation ideal plays a basic role in group cohomology , amongst other applications.  References    Dummit and Foote, Abstract Algebra   "  Category:Ideals  Category:Hopf algebras
