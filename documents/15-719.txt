   Boundary conditions in CFD      Boundary conditions in CFD   Almost every computational fluid dynamics problem is defined under the limits of initial and boundary conditions. For implementation of boundary conditions when we construct a staggered grid we add an extra node across the physical boundary in order to get,   The nodes just outside the inlet of the system are used to assign the inlet conditions  The physical boundaries can coincide with the scalar control volume boundaries.   This allow us to introduce the boundary conditions and achieve discretion equations for nodes near boundary with small modifications.  Most common boundary conditions used in computational fluid dynamics are   Intake conditions  Symmetry conditions  Physical boundary conditions  Cyclic conditions  pressure conditions  exit conditions   Intake boundary conditions  We are considering the case of an inlet perpendicular to the x-direction -   For the first u, v, φ-cell all links to neighboring nodes are active, so there is no need of any modifications to discretion equations.    At one of the inlet node absolute pressure is fixed and made pressure correction to zero at that node.    Generally computational fluid dynamics codes estimate k and ε with approximate formulate based on turbulent intensity between 1 and 6% and length scale   Symmetry boundary condition  If flow across the boundary is zero :  Normal velocities are set to zero  Scalar flux across the boundary is zero :  In this type of situations values of properties just adjacent to the solution domain are taken as values at the nearest node just inside the domain.  physical boundary conditions  Consider situation solid wall parallel to the x-direction:   Assumptions made and relations considered -   The near wall flow is considered as laminar and the velocity varies linearly with distance from the wall  No slip condition: u = v = 0.  In this we are applying the “wall functions” instead of the mesh points.   Turbulent flow :       y  +   >   11.63        superscript  y    11.63    y^{+}>11.63\,   .  in the log-law region of a turbulent boundary layer.  Laminar flow :       y  +   <   11.63        superscript  y    11.63    y^{+}<11.63\,   .  Important points for applying wall functions:   The velocity is constant along parallel to the wall and varies only in the direction normal to the wall.  No pressure gradients in the flow direction.  High Reynolds number  No chemical reactions at the wall   cyclic boundary condition   We take flux of flow leaving the outlet cycle boundary equal to the flux entering the inlet cycle boundary    Values of each variable at the nodes at upstream and downstream of the inlet of the inlet plane are equal to values at the nodes at upstream and downstream of the outlet plane.   Pressure boundary condition    These conditions are used when we don’t know the exact details of flow distribution but boundary values of pressure are known  For example: external flows around objects, internal flows with multiple outlets, buoyancy -driven flows, free surface flows, etc.   The pressure corrections are taken zero at the nodes.   exit boundary conditions  Considering the case of an outlet perpendicular to the x-direction -  In fully developed flow no changes occurs in flow direction, gradient of all variables except pressure are zero in flow direction  The equations are solved for cells up to NI-1, outside the domain values of flow variables are determined by extrapolation from the interior by assuming zero gradients at the outlet plane  The outlet plane velocities with the continuity correction       U    N  I   ,  J    =    U     N  I   -  1   ,  J       M   i  n     M   o  u  t            subscript  U     N  I   J       subscript  U       N  I   1   J       subscript  M    i  n     subscript  M    o  u  t        U_{NI,J}=U_{NI-1,J}\frac{M_{in}}{M_{out}}\,   .
