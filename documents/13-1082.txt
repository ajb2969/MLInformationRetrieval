Gauge symmetry (mathematics)

In mathematics, any Lagrangian system generally admits gauge symmetries, though it may happen that they are trivial. In theoretical physics, the notion of gauge symmetries depending on parameter functions is a cornerstone of contemporary field theory.
A gauge symmetry of a Lagrangian

 
  is defined as a differential operator on some vector bundle

 
  taking its values in the linear space of (variational or exact) symmetries of 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, a gauge symmetry of 
 
 
 
  depends on sections of 
 
 
 
  and their partial derivatives.1 For instance, this is the case of gauge symmetries in classical field theory.2 Yang–Mills gauge theory and gauge gravitation theory exemplify classical field theories with gauge symmetries.3 Gauge symmetries possess the following two peculiarities.
(i) Being Lagrangian symmetries, gauge symmetries of a Lagrangian satisfy first Noether's theorem, but the corresponding conserved current 
 
 
 
  takes a particular superpotential form 
 
 
 
  where the first term 
 
 
 
  vanishes on solutions of the Euler–Lagrange equations and the second one is a boundary term, where 
 
 
 
  is called a superpotential.4
(ii) In accordance with second Noether's theorem, there is one-to-one correspondence between the gauge symmetries of a Lagrangian and the Noether identities which the Euler–Lagrange operator satisfies. Consequently, gauge symmetries characterize the degeneracy of a Lagrangian system.5
Note that, in quantum field theory, a generating functional fail to be invariant under gauge transformations, and gauge symmetries are replaced with the BRST symmetries, depending on ghosts and acting both on fields and ghosts.6
