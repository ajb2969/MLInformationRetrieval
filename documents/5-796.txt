   Scalar projection      Scalar projection     In mathematics, the scalar projection of a vector    𝐚   𝐚   \mathbf{a}   on (or onto) a vector   𝐛   𝐛   \mathbf{b}   , also known as the scalar resolute or scalar component of   𝐚   𝐚   \mathbf{a}   in the direction of   𝐛   𝐛   \mathbf{b}   , is given by:       s  =    |  𝐚  |    cos  θ    =   𝐚  ⋅   𝐛  ^     ,        s      𝐚     θ          normal-⋅  𝐚   normal-^  𝐛       s=|\mathbf{a}|\cos\theta=\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{b}},     where the operator   ⋅   normal-⋅   \cdot   denotes a dot product ,    𝐛  ^     normal-^  𝐛    \hat{\mathbf{b}}   is the unit vector in the direction of   𝐛   𝐛   \mathbf{b}   ,    |  𝐚  |      𝐚    |\mathbf{a}|   is the length of   𝐚   𝐚   \mathbf{a}   , and   θ   θ   \theta   is the angle between   𝐚   𝐚   \mathbf{a}   and   𝐛   𝐛   \mathbf{b}   .  The scalar projection is a scalar , equal to the length of the orthogonal projection of   𝐚   𝐚   \mathbf{a}   on   𝐛   𝐛   \mathbf{b}   , with a minus sign if the projection has an opposite direction with respect to   𝐛   𝐛   \mathbf{b}   .  Multiplying the scalar projection of   𝐚   𝐚   \mathbf{a}   on   𝐛   𝐛   \mathbf{b}   by    𝐛  ^     normal-^  𝐛    \mathbf{\hat{b}}   converts it into the above-mentioned orthogonal projection, also called vector projection of   𝐚   𝐚   \mathbf{a}   on   𝐛   𝐛   \mathbf{b}   .  Definition based on angle θ  If the angle    θ   θ   \theta   between   𝐚   𝐚   \mathbf{a}   and   𝐛   𝐛   \mathbf{b}   is known, the scalar projection of   𝐚   𝐚   \mathbf{a}   on   𝐛   𝐛   \mathbf{b}   can be computed using       s  =    |  𝐚  |    cos  θ     .      s      𝐚     θ      s=|\mathbf{a}|\cos\theta.     Definition in terms of a and b  When   θ   θ   \theta   is not known, the cosine of   θ   θ   \theta   can be computed in terms of   𝐚   𝐚   \mathbf{a}   and   𝐛   𝐛   \mathbf{b}   , by the following property of the dot product     𝐚  ⋅  𝐛     normal-⋅  𝐚  𝐛    \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}   :        𝐚  ⋅  𝐛     |  𝐚  |    |  𝐛  |     =   cos   θ           normal-⋅  𝐚  𝐛       𝐚     𝐛       θ     \frac{\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}}{|\mathbf{a}|\,|\mathbf{b}|}=\cos\theta\,     By this property, the definition of the scalar projection    s    s   s\,   becomes:      s  =    |  𝐚  |    cos  θ    =    |  𝐚  |     𝐚  ⋅  𝐛     |  𝐚  |    |  𝐛  |      =     𝐚  ⋅  𝐛    |  𝐛  |           s      𝐚     θ             𝐚      normal-⋅  𝐚  𝐛       𝐚     𝐛              normal-⋅  𝐚  𝐛     𝐛       s=|\mathbf{a}|\cos\theta=|\mathbf{a}|\frac{\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}}{|\mathbf%
 {a}|\,|\mathbf{b}|}=\frac{\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}}{|\mathbf{b}|}\,     Properties  The scalar projection has a negative sign if    90  <  θ  ≤  180        90  θ       180     90<\theta\leq 180   degrees. It coincides with the length of the corresponding vector projection if the angle is smaller than 90°. More exactly, if the vector projection is denoted    𝐚  1     subscript  𝐚  1    \mathbf{a}_{1}   and its length    |   𝐚  1   |       subscript  𝐚  1     |\mathbf{a}_{1}|   :      s  =   |   𝐚  1   |       s     subscript  𝐚  1      s=|\mathbf{a}_{1}|   if    0  <  θ  ≤  90        0  θ       90     0<\theta\leq 90   degrees,      s  =   -   |   𝐚  1   |        s       subscript  𝐚  1       s=-|\mathbf{a}_{1}|   if    90  <  θ  ≤  180        90  θ       180     90<\theta\leq 180   degrees.
