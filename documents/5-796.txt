Scalar projection

 
In mathematics, the scalar projection of a vector

 
  on (or onto) a vector 
 
 
 
 , also known as the scalar resolute or scalar component of 
 
 
 
  in the direction of 
 
 
 
 , is given by:



where the operator 
 
 
 
  denotes a dot product, 
 
 
 
  is the unit vector in the direction of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the length of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the angle between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The scalar projection is a scalar, equal to the length of the orthogonal projection of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , with a minus sign if the projection has an opposite direction with respect to 
 
 
 
 .
Multiplying the scalar projection of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  converts it into the above-mentioned orthogonal projection, also called vector projection of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 .
Definition based on angle θ
If the angle

 
  between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is known, the scalar projection of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  can be computed using



Definition in terms of a and b
When 
 
 
 
  is not known, the cosine of 
 
 
 
  can be computed in terms of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , by the following property of the dot product

 
 :



By this property, the definition of the scalar projection 
 
 
 
  becomes:



Properties
The scalar projection has a negative sign if 
 
 
 
  degrees. It coincides with the length of the corresponding vector projection if the angle is smaller than 90°. More exactly, if the vector projection is denoted 
 
 
 
  and its length 
 
 
 
 :


 
  if 
 
 
 
  degrees,


 
  if 
 
 
 
  degrees.
