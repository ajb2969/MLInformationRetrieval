   Trehalose O-mycolyltransferase      Trehalose O-mycolyltransferase   In enzymology , a trehalose O-mycolyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 alpha,alpha-trehalose 6-mycolate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   alpha,alpha-trehalose + alpha,alpha-trehalose 6,6'-bismycolate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , alpha,alpha'-trehalose 6-mycolate , and two products , alpha,alpha-trehalose and alpha,alpha'-trehalose 6,6'-bismycolate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha,alpha-trehalose-6-mycolate:alpha,alpha-trehalose-6-mycolate 6'-mycolyltransferase . Other names in common use include alpha,alpha'-trehalose 6-monomycolate:alpha,alpha'-trehalose , mycolyltransferase , alpha,alpha'-trehalose-6-mycolate:alpha,alpha'-trehalose-6-mycolate , and 6'-mycolyltransferase .
