   Socle (mathematics)      Socle (mathematics)   In mathematics , the term socle has several related meanings.  Socle of a group  In the context of group theory , the socle of a group  G , denoted soc( G ), is the subgroup generated by the minimal normal subgroups of G . It can happen that a group has no minimal non-trivial normal subgroup (that is, every non-trivial normal subgroup properly contains another such subgroup) and in that case the socle is defined to be the subgroup generated by the identity. The socle is a direct product of minimal normal subgroups.  As an example, consider the cyclic group  Z 12 with generator  u , which has two minimal normal subgroups, one generated by u 4 (which gives a normal subgroup with 3 elements) and the other by u 6 (which gives a normal subgroup with 2 elements). Thus the socle of Z 12 is the group generated by u 4 and u 6 , which is just the group generated by u 2 .  The socle is a characteristic subgroup , and hence a normal subgroup. It is not necessarily transitively normal , however.  If a group G is a finite solvable group , then the socle can be expressed as a product of elementary abelian  p-groups . Thus, in this case, it is just a product of copies of Z/pZ for various p where the same p may occur multiple times in the product.  Socle of a module  In the context of module theory and ring theory the socle of a module  M over a ring  R is defined to be the sum of the minimal nonzero submodules of M . It can be considered as a dual notion to that of the radical of a module . In set notation,  $$\mathrm {soc}(M) = \sum \{ N \mid N \text{ is a simple submodule of }M \}. \,$$ Equivalently,  $$\mathrm {soc}(M) = \bigcap\{ E \mid E \text{ is an essential submodule of }M \}. \,$$  The socle of a ring  R can refer to one of two sets in the ring. Considering R as a right R module, soc( R R ) is defined, and considering R as a left R module, soc( R R ) is defined. Both of these socles are ring ideals , and it is known they are not necessarily equal.   If M is an Artinian module , soc( M ) is itself an essential submodule of M .  A module is semisimple if and only if soc( M ) = M . Rings for which soc( M ) = M for all M are precisely semisimple rings .  M is a finitely cogenerated module if and only if soc( M ) is finitely generated and soc(M) is an essential submodule of M.  Since the sum of semisimple modules is semisimple, the socle of a module could also be defined as the unique maximal semi-simple submodule.  From the definition of rad( R ), it is easy to see that rad( R ) annihilates soc( R ). If R is a finite-dimensional unital algebra and M a finitely generated R -module then the socle consists precisely of the elements annihilated by the Jacobson radical of R . 1   Socle of a Lie algebra  In the context of Lie algebras , a socle of a symmetric Lie algebra is the eigenspace of its structural automorphism which corresponds to the eigenvalue −1. (A symmetric Lie algebra decomposes into the direct sum of its socle and cosocle .) 2  See also   Injective hull  Radical of a module  Cosocle   References         "  Category:Module theory  Category:Group theory  Category:Functional subgroups     J.
