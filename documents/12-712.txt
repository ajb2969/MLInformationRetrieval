Multiple zeta function

In mathematics, the multiple zeta functions are generalisations of the Riemann zeta function, defined by



and converge when Re(s1) + ... + Re(si) > i for all i. Like the Riemann zeta function, the multiple zeta functions can be analytically continued to be meromorphic functions (see, for example, Zhao (1999)). When s1, ..., sk are all positive integers (with s1 > 1) these sums are often called multiple zeta values (MZVs) or Euler sums.
The k in the above definition is named the "length" of a MZV, and the n = s1 + ... + sk is known as the "weight".1
The standard shorthand for writing multiple zeta functions is to place repeating strings of the argument within braces and use a superscript to indicate the number of repetitions. For example,



Two parameters case
In the particular case of only two parameters we have (with s>1 and n,m integer):2





 
  where 
 
 
 
  are the generalized harmonic numbers.
Multiple zeta functions are known to satisfy what is known as MZV duality, the simplest case of which is the famous identity of Euler:



where Hn are the harmonic numbers.
Special values of double zeta functions, with s > 0 and even, t > 1 and odd, but s+t=2N+1 (taking if necessary ζ(0) = 0):3

Note that if 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
  irreducibles, i.e. these MZVs cannot be written as function of 
 
 
 
  only.4
Three parameters case
In the particular case of only three parameters we have (with a>1 and n,j,i integer):



Euler reflection formula
The above MZVs satisfy the Euler reflection formula:


 
  for 
 
 

Using the shuffle relations, it is easy to prove that:5


 
  for 
 
 

This function can be seen as a generalization of the reflection formulas.
Symmetric sums in terms of the zeta function
Let 
 
 
 
 , and for a partition 
 
 
 
  of the set 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
 . Also, given such a 
 
 
 
  and a k-tuple 
 
 
 
  of exponents, define 
 
 
 
 .
The relations between the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are: 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

Theorem 1(Hoffman)
For any real 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
Proof. Assume the 
 
 
 
  are all distinct. (There is not loss of generality, since we can take limits.) The left-hand side can be written as 
 
 
 
 . Now thinking on the symmetric
group 
 
 
 
  as acting on k-tuple 
 
 
 
  of positive integers. A given k-tuple 
 
 
 
  has an isotropy group


 
  and an associated partition 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 

 
  is the set of equivalence classes of the relation given by 
 
 
 
  iff 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . Now the term 
 
 
 
 
  occurs on the left-hand side of 
 
 
 
  exactly 
 
 
 
  times. It occurs on the right-hand side in those terms corresponding to partitions 
 
 
 
  that are refinements of 
 
 
 
 : letting 
 
 
 
 
  denote refinement, 
 
 
 
  occurs 
 
 
 
  times. Thus, the conclusion will follow if 
 
 
 
  for any k-tuple 
 
 
 
  and associated partition 
 
 
 
 . To see this, note that 
 
 
 
  counts the permutations having cycle-type specified by 
 
 
 
 : since any elements of 
 
 
 
  has a unique cycle-type specified by a partition that refines 
 
 
 
 , the result follows.6
For 
 
 
 
 , the theorem says 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 . This is the main result of.7
Having 
 
 
 
 . To state the analog of Theorem 1 for the 
 
 
 
 , we require one bit of notation. For a partition


 
  or 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
 .
Theorem 2(Hoffman)
For any real 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
Proof. We follow the same line of argument as in the preceding proof. The left-hand side is now 
 
 
 
 , and a term 
 
 
 
  occurs on the left-hand since once if all the 
 
 
 
  are distinct, and not at all otherwise. Thus, it suffices to show 
 
 
 
  (1)
To prove this, note first that the sign of 
 
 
 
  is positive if the permutations of cycle-type 
 
 
 
  are even, and negative if they are odd: thus, the left-hand side of (1) is the signed sum of the number of even and odd permutations in the isotropy group 
 
 
 
 . But such an isotropy group has equal numbers of even and odd permutations unless it is trivial, i.e. unless the associated partition 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 .8
The sum and duality conjectures9
We first state the sum conjecture, which is due to C. Moen.10
Sum conjecture(Hoffman). For positive integers k=n, 
 
 
 
 , where the sum is extended over k-tuples 
 
 
 
  of positive integers with 
 
 
 
 .
There remarks concerning this conjecture are in order. First, it implies 
 
 
 
 . Second, in the case 
 
 
 
  it says that 
 
 
 
 , or using the relation between the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and Theorem 1, 
 
 

This was proved by Euler's paper11 and has been rediscovered several times, in particular by Williams.12 Finally, C. Moen13 has proved the same conjecture for k=3 by lengthy but elementary arguments. For the duality conjecture, we first define an involution 
 
 
 
  on the set 
 
 
 
  of finite sequences of positive integers whose first element is greater than 1. Let 
 
 
 
  be the set of strictly increasig finite sequences of positive integers, and let 
 
 
 
  be the function that sends a sequence in 
 
 
 
  to its sequence of partial sums. If 
 
 
 
  is the set of sequences in 
 
 
 
  whose last element is at most 
 
 
 
 , we have two commuting involutions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  = complement of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  arranged in increasing order. The our definition of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
For example, 
 
 
 
  We shall say the sequences 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are dual to each other, and refer to a sequence fixed by 
 
 
 
  as self-dual.14
Duality conjecture (Hoffman). If 
 
 
 
  is dual to 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .
This sum conjecture is also known as Sum Theorem, and it may be expressed as follows: the Riemann zeta value of an integer n ≥ 2 is equal to the sum of all the valid (i.e. with s1 > 1) MZVs of the partitions of length k and weight n, with 1 ≤ k ≤n − 1. In formula:15



For example with length k = 2 and weight n = 7:
