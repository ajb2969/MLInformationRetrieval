   Reynolds operator      Reynolds operator   In fluid dynamics and invariant theory , a Reynolds operator is a mathematical operator given by averaging something over a group action, that satisfies a set of properties called Reynolds rules. In fluid dynamics Reynolds operators are often encountered in models of turbulent flows , particularly the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations , where the average is typically taken over the fluid flow under the group of time translations. In invariant theory the average is often taken over a compact group or reductive algebraic group acting on a commutative algebra, such as a ring of polynomials. Reynolds operators were introduced into fluid dynamics by  and named by .  Definition  Reynolds operators are used in fluid dynamics, functional analysis, and invariant theory, and the notation and definitions in these areas differ slightly. A Reynolds operator acting on φ is sometimes denoted by R ( φ ), P ( φ ), ρ ( φ ), 〈 φ 〉, or    φ  ¯     normal-¯  φ    \overline{φ}   . Reynolds operators are usually linear operators acting on some algebra of functions, satisfying the identity   R ( R ( φ ) ψ ) = R ( φ ) R ( ψ ) for all φ , ψ    and sometimes some other conditions, such as commuting with various group actions.  Invariant theory  In invariant theory a Reynolds operator R is usually a linear operator satisfying   R ( R ( φ ) ψ ) = R ( φ ) R ( ψ ) for all φ , ψ    and   R (1) = 1.   Together these conditions imply that R is idempotent: R 2 = R . The Reynolds operator will also usually commute with some group action, and project onto the invariant elements of this group action.  Functional analysis  In functional analysis a Reynolds operator is a linear operator R acting on some algebra of functions φ , satisfying the Reynolds identity   R ( φψ ) = R ( φ ) R ( ψ ) + R (( φ − R ( φ ))( ψ − R ( ψ ))) for all φ , ψ    The operator R is called an averaging operator if it is linear and satisfies   R ( R ( φ ) ψ ) = R ( φ ) R ( ψ ) for all φ , ψ .   If R ( R ( φ )) = R ( φ ) for all φ then R is an averaging operator if and only if it is a Reynolds operator. Sometimes the R ( R ( φ )) = R ( φ ) condition is added to the definition of Reynolds operators.  Fluid dynamics  Let   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   and   ψ   ψ   \psi   be two random variables, and   a   a   a   be an arbitrary constant. Then the properties satisfied by Reynolds operators, for an operator     ⟨  ⟩   ,      \langle\rangle,   include linearity and the averaging property:        ⟨   ϕ  +  ψ   ⟩   =    ⟨  ϕ  ⟩   +   ⟨  ψ  ⟩     ,       delimited-⟨⟩    ϕ  ψ       delimited-⟨⟩  ϕ    delimited-⟨⟩  ψ      \langle\phi+\psi\rangle=\langle\phi\rangle+\langle\psi\rangle,\,           ⟨   a  ϕ   ⟩   =   a   ⟨  ϕ  ⟩     ,       delimited-⟨⟩    a  ϕ      a   delimited-⟨⟩  ϕ      \langle a\phi\rangle=a\langle\phi\rangle,\,           ⟨    ⟨  ϕ  ⟩   ψ   ⟩   =    ⟨  ϕ  ⟩    ⟨  ψ  ⟩     ,       delimited-⟨⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  ϕ   ψ       delimited-⟨⟩  ϕ    delimited-⟨⟩  ψ      \langle\langle\phi\rangle\psi\rangle=\langle\phi\rangle\langle\psi\rangle,\,   which implies      ⟨   ⟨  ϕ  ⟩   ⟩   =   ⟨  ϕ  ⟩    .       delimited-⟨⟩   delimited-⟨⟩  ϕ     delimited-⟨⟩  ϕ     \langle\langle\phi\rangle\rangle=\langle\phi\rangle.\,   In addition the Reynolds operator is often assumed to commute with space and time translations:         ⟨    ∂  ϕ    ∂  t    ⟩   =    ∂   ⟨  ϕ  ⟩     ∂  t     ,    ⟨    ∂  ϕ    ∂  x    ⟩   =    ∂   ⟨  ϕ  ⟩     ∂  x      ,     formulae-sequence     delimited-⟨⟩      ϕ     t         ϕ     t        delimited-⟨⟩      ϕ     x         ϕ     x       \left\langle\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t}\right\rangle=\frac{\partial\langle%
 \phi\rangle}{\partial t},\qquad\left\langle\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial x}%
 \right\rangle=\frac{\partial\langle\phi\rangle}{\partial x},           ⟨   ∫   ϕ   (  𝒙  ,  t  )   d   𝒙   d  t    ⟩   =   ∫    ⟨   ϕ   (  𝒙  ,  t  )    ⟩   d   𝒙   d  t     .       delimited-⟨⟩      ϕ   𝒙  t   d  𝒙  d  t          delimited-⟨⟩    ϕ   𝒙  t     d  𝒙  d  t      \left\langle\int\phi(\boldsymbol{x},t)\,d\boldsymbol{x}\,dt\right\rangle=\int%
 \langle\phi(\boldsymbol{x},t)\rangle\,d\boldsymbol{x}\,dt.     Any operator satisfying these properties is a Reynolds operator. 1  Examples  Reynolds operators are often given by projecting onto an invariant subspace of a group action.   The "Reynolds operator" considered by  was essentially the projection of a fluid flow to the "average" fluid flow, which can be thought of as projection to time-invariant flows. Here the group action is given by the action of the group of time-translations.    Suppose that G is a reductive algebraic group or a compact group, and V is a finite-dimensional representation of G . Then G also acts on the symmetric algebra SV of polynomials. The Reynolds operator R is the G -invariant projection from SV to the subring SV G of elements fixed by G .
