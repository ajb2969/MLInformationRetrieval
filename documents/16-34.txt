Elisabethatriene synthase

Elisabethatriene synthase (, elisabethatriene cyclase) is an enzyme with system name geranylgeranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (elisabethatriene-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

geranylgeranyl diphosphate

elisabethatriene + diphosphate


This enzyme requires Mg2+ or less efficiently Mn2+.
