   Boolean model (probability theory)      Boolean model (probability theory)   (Figure)  Realization of Boolean model with random-radii discs.   In probability theory , the Boolean-Poisson model or simply Boolean model for a random subset of the plane (or higher dimensions, analogously) is one of the simplest and most tractable models in stochastic geometry . Take a Poisson point process of rate   λ   λ   \lambda   in the plane and make each point be the center of a random set; the resulting union of overlapping sets is a realization of the Boolean model   ℬ   ℬ   {\mathcal{B}}   . More precisely, the parameters are   λ   λ   \lambda   and a probability distribution on compact sets; for each point   ξ   ξ   \xi   of the Poisson point process we pick a set    C  ξ     subscript  C  ξ    C_{\xi}   from the distribution, and then define   ℬ   ℬ   {\mathcal{B}}   as the union     ∪  ξ    (   ξ  +   C  ξ    )       subscript   ξ     ξ   subscript  C  ξ      \cup_{\xi}(\xi+C_{\xi})   of translated sets.  To illustrate tractability with one simple formula, the mean density of   ℬ   ℬ   {\mathcal{B}}   equals    1  -   exp   (   -   λ  A    )        1        λ  A       1-\exp(-\lambda A)   where   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   denotes the area of    C  ξ     subscript  C  ξ    C_{\xi}   and     A  =   E   (  Γ  )     .      A   normal-E  normal-Γ     A=\operatorname{E}(\Gamma).   The classical theory of stochastic geometry develops many further formulae. 1 2  As related topics, the case of constant-sized discs is the basic model of continuum percolation 3 and the low-density Boolean models serve as a first-order approximations in the study of extremes in many models. 4  References    "  Category:Spatial processes     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
