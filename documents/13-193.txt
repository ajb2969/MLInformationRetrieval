Realization of Boolean model with random-radii discs.

In probability theory, the Boolean-Poisson model or simply Boolean model for a random subset of the plane (or higher dimensions, analogously) is one of the simplest and most tractable models in stochastic geometry. Take a Poisson point process of rate 
 
 
 
  in the plane and make each point be the center of a random set; the resulting union of overlapping sets is a realization of the Boolean model 
 
 
 
 . More precisely, the parameters are 
 
 
 
  and a probability distribution on compact sets; for each point 
 
 
 
  of the Poisson point process we pick a set 
 
 
 
  from the distribution, and then define 
 
 
 
  as the union 
 
 
 
  of translated sets.
To illustrate tractability with one simple formula, the mean density of 
 
 
 
  equals 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes the area of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  The classical theory of stochastic geometry develops many further formulae. 12
As related topics, the case of constant-sized discs is the basic model of continuum percolation3 and the low-density Boolean models serve as a first-order approximations in the study of extremes in many models.4
