Biot–Tolstoy–Medwin diffraction model

In applied mathematics, the Biot–Tolstoy–Medwin (BTM) diffraction model describes edge diffraction. Unlike the uniform theory of diffraction (UTD), BTM does not make the high frequency assumption (in which edge lengths and distances from source and receiver are much larger than the wavelength). BTM sees use in acoustic simulations.1
Impulse response
The impulse response according to BTM is given as follows:2
The general expression for sound pressure is given by the convolution integral



where 
 
 
 
  represents the source signal, and 
 
 
 
  represents the impulse response at the receiver position. The BTM gives the latter in terms of

the source position in cylindrical coordinates 
 
 
 
  where the 
 
 
 
 -axis is considered to lie on the edge and 
 
 
 
  is measured from one of the faces of the wedge.
the receiver position 
 
 

the (outer) wedge angle

where the summation is over the four possible choices of the two signs, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the distances from the point 
 
 
 
  to the source and receiver respectively, and 
 
 
 
  is the Dirac delta function.
