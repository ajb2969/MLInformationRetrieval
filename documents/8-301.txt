   Spin pumping      Spin pumping   Spin pumping is a method of generating a spin current , the spintronic analog of a battery in conventional electronics .  In order to make a spintronic device, the primary requirement is to have a system that can generate a current of spin-polarized electrons , as well as a system that is sensitive to the spin polarization. Most spintronic devices also have a unit in between these two that changes the current of electrons depending on the spin states. Candidates for such devices include injection schemes based on magnetic semiconductors and ferromagnetic  metals , ferromagnetic resonance devices 1 , and a variety of spin-dependent pumps . Optical, microwave and electrical methods are also being explored   .These devices could be used for low-power data transmission in spintronic devices   or to transmit electrical signals through insulators.   The spin pumped into an adjacent layer by a precessing magnetic moment is given by 2        j  →   s   =    ℏ   4  π     g    ↑  ↓     1   M  S  2     ⟨     M  →    (  t  )    ×    d   M  →    (  t  )   )    d  t     ⟩         subscript   normal-→  j   s       Planck-constant-over-2-pi    4  π     superscript  g   normal-↑  absent  normal-↓      1   superscript   subscript  M  S   2     delimited-⟨⟩       normal-→  M   t      fragments  d   normal-→  M    fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)   normal-)     d  t         \vec{j}_{s}={\hbar\over{4\pi}}g^{\uparrow\downarrow}{1\over M_{S}^{2}}\langle%
 \vec{M}(t)\times{{d\vec{M}(t))}\over{dt}}\rangle   where     j  →   s     subscript   normal-→  j   s    \vec{j}_{s}   is the spin current (the vector indicates the orientation of the spin, not the direction of the current),    g    ↑  ↓      superscript  g   normal-↑  absent  normal-↓     g^{\uparrow\downarrow}   is the spin-mixing conductance,    M  S     subscript  M  S    M_{S}   is the saturation magnetization, and     M  →    (  t  )        normal-→  M   t    \vec{M}(t)   is the time-dependent orientation of the moment.
