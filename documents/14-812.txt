   Wiener–Wintner theorem      Wiener–Wintner theorem   In mathematics, the Wiener–Wintner theorem , named after Norbert Wiener and Aurel Wintner , is a strengthening of the ergodic theorem , proved by  Statement  Suppose that τ is a measure-preserving transformation of a measure space S with finite measure. If f is a real-valued integrable function on S then the Wiener–Wintner theorem states that there is a measure 0 set E such that the average       lim   ℓ  →  ∞      1    2  ℓ   +  1      ∑   j  =   -  ℓ    ℓ     e   i  j  λ    f   (    τ  j   P   )          subscript    normal-→  normal-ℓ         1      2  normal-ℓ   1      superscript   subscript     j    normal-ℓ     normal-ℓ      superscript  e    i  j  λ    f     superscript  τ  j   P        \lim_{\ell\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{2\ell+1}\sum_{j=-\ell}^{\ell}e^{ij\lambda%
 }f(\tau^{j}P)     exists for all real λ and for all P not in E .  The special case for λ = 0 is essentially the Birkhoff ergodic theorem , from which the existence of a suitable measure 0 set E for any fixed λ , or any countable set of values λ , immediately follows. The point of the Wiener–Wintner theorem is that one can choose the measure 0 exceptional set E to be independent of λ .  This theorem was even much more generalized by the Return Times Theorem.
