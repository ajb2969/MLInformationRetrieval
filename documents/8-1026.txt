Identity theorem for Riemann surfaces

In mathematics, the identity theorem for Riemann surfaces is a theorem that states that a holomorphic function is completely determined by its values on any subset of its domain that has a limit point.
Statement of the theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be Riemann surfaces, let X be connected, and let 
 
 
 
  be holomorphic. Suppose that 
 
 
 
  for some subset 
 
 
 
  that has a limit point, where 
 
 
 
  denotes the restriction of 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  (on the whole of 
 
 
 
 ).
