   Identity theorem for Riemann surfaces      Identity theorem for Riemann surfaces   In mathematics , the identity theorem for Riemann surfaces is a theorem that states that a holomorphic function is completely determined by its values on any subset of its domain that has a limit point .  Statement of the theorem  Let   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   be Riemann surfaces, let X be connected, and let    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   be holomorphic. Suppose that      f  |   A   =    g  |   A        evaluated-at  f  A    evaluated-at  g  A     f|_{A}=g|_{A}   for some subset    A  ⊆  X      A  X    A\subseteq X   that has a limit point, where      f  |   A   :   A  →  Y      normal-:   evaluated-at  f  A    normal-→  A  Y     f|_{A}:A\to Y   denotes the restriction of   f   f   f   to   A   A   A   . Then    f  =  g      f  g    f=g   (on the whole of   X   X   X   ).  References     "  Category:Theorems in complex analysis  Category:Riemann surfaces
