Particle acceleration

In a compressible sound transmission medium - mainly air - air particles get an accelerated motion: the particle acceleration or sound acceleration with the symbol a in metre/second². In acoustics or physics, acceleration (symbol: a) is defined as the rate of change (or time derivative) of velocity. It is thus a vector quantity with dimension length/time². In SI units, this is m/s².
To accelerate an object (air particle) is to change its velocity over a period. Acceleration is defined technically as "the rate of change of velocity of an object with respect to time" and is given by the equation



where

a is the acceleration vector
v is the velocity vector expressed in m/s
t is time expressed in seconds.

This equation gives a the units of m/(s·s), or m/s² (read as "metres per second per second", or "metres per second squared").
An alternative equation is:



where


 
  is the average acceleration (m/s²)


 
  is the initial velocity (m/s)


 
  is the final velocity (m/s)


 
  is the time interval (s)
Transverse acceleration (perpendicular to velocity) causes change in direction. If it is constant in magnitude and changing in direction with the velocity, we get a circular motion. For this centripetal acceleration we have



One common unit of acceleration is g-force, one g being the acceleration caused by the gravity of Earth.
In classical mechanics, acceleration 
 
 
 
  is related to force

 
  and mass

 
  (assumed to be constant) by way of Newton's second law:
