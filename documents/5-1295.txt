   Particle acceleration      Particle acceleration   In a compressible sound transmission medium - mainly air - air particles get an accelerated motion: the particle acceleration or sound acceleration with the symbol a in metre/second² . In acoustics or physics , acceleration (symbol: a ) is defined as the rate of change (or time derivative ) of velocity . It is thus a vector quantity with dimension length / time ². In SI units , this is m/s².  To accelerate an object (air particle) is to change its velocity over a period. Acceleration is defined technically as "the rate of change of velocity of an object with respect to time" and is given by the equation      𝐚  =    d  𝐯    d  t        𝐚      d  𝐯     d  t      \mathbf{a}={d\mathbf{v}\over dt}     where   a is the acceleration vector  v is the velocity vector expressed in m/s  t is time expressed in seconds.   This equation gives a the units of m/(s·s), or m/s² (read as "metres per second per second", or "metres per second squared").  An alternative equation is:       𝐚  ¯   =    𝐯  -  𝐮   t        normal-¯  𝐚       𝐯  𝐮   t     \mathbf{\bar{a}}={\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u}\over t}     where      𝐚  ¯     normal-¯  𝐚    \mathbf{\bar{a}}   is the average acceleration (m/s²)     𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   is the initial velocity (m/s)     𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   is the final velocity (m/s)     t   t   t   is the time interval (s)  Transverse acceleration (perpendicular to velocity) causes change in direction. If it is constant in magnitude and changing in direction with the velocity, we get a circular motion . For this centripetal acceleration we have      𝐚  =   -     v  2   r    𝐫  r     =   -    ω  2   𝐫          𝐚         superscript  v  2   r     𝐫  r               superscript  ω  2   𝐫       \mathbf{a}=-\frac{v^{2}}{r}\frac{\mathbf{r}}{r}=-\omega^{2}\mathbf{r}     One common unit of acceleration is g-force , one g being the acceleration caused by the gravity of Earth .
