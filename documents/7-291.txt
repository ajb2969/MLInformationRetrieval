   Hückel method      Hückel method  The '''Hückel method''' or '''Hückel molecular orbital method (HMO)''', proposed by [[Erich Hückel]] in 1930, is a very simple [[LCAO MO Method|linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbitals (LCAO MO) method]] for the determination of energies of [[molecular orbital]]s of [[pi electrons]] in conjugated hydrocarbon systems, such a s ethene , benzene and butadiene . 1 2 It is the theoretical basis for the Hückel's rule . It was later extended to conjugated molecules such as pyridine , pyrrole and furan that contain atoms other than carbon, known in this context as heteroatoms . 3 The extended Hückel method developed by Roald Hoffmann is computational and three-dimensional and was used to test the Woodward–Hoffmann rules . 4  It is a very powerful educational tool, and details appear in many chemistry textbooks.  Hückel characteristics  The method has several characteristics:   It limits itself to conjugated hydrocarbons.  Only pi electron molecular orbitals (MO's) are included because these determine the general properties of these molecules and the sigma electrons are ignored. This is referred to as sigma-pi separability. It is justified by the orthogonality of sigma and pi orbitals in planar molecules. For this reason, the Hückel method is limited to planar systems.  The method takes as inputs the LCAO MO Method , the Schrödinger equation and simplifications based on orbital symmetry considerations. Interestingly the method does not take in any physical constants.  The method predicts how many energy levels exist for a given molecule, which levels are degenerate and it expresses the MO energies as the sum of two other energy terms, called alpha, the energy of an electron in a 2p-orbital, and beta, an interaction energy between two p orbitals which are still unknown but importantly have become independent of the molecule. In addition it enables calculation of charge density for each atom in the pi framework, the bond order between any two atoms, and the overall molecular dipole moment .   Hückel results  The results for a few simple molecules are tabulated below:      Molecule   Energy   Frontier orbital   HOMO–LUMO energy gap       Ethylene   E 1 = α - β   LUMO   −2β      E 2 = α + β   HOMO      Butadiene   E 1 = α + 1.62β        E 2 = α + 0.62β   HOMO   −1.24β      E 3 = α − 0.62β   LUMO       E 4 = α − 1.62β       Benzene   E 1 = α + 2β        E 2 = α + β        E 3 = α + β   HOMO   −2β      E 4 = α − β   LUMO       E 5 = α − β        E 6 = α − 2β       Cyclobutadiene   E 1 = α + 2β        E 2 = α   SOMO   0      E 3 = α   SOMO       E 4 = α − 2β       Table 1. Hückel method results .  Lowest energies of top α and β are both negative values. 5       The theory predicts two energy levels for ethylene with its two pi electrons filling the low-energy HOMO and the high energy LUMO remaining empty. In butadiene the 4 pi electrons occupy 2 low energy MO's, out of a total of 4, and for benzene 6 energy levels are predicted, two of them degenerate .  For linear and cyclic systems (with n atoms), general solutions exist: 6  (Figure)  Frost circle mnemonic for 1,3-cyclopenta-5-idenyl anion   :* Linear     E  k   =   α  +   2  β   cos    k  π    (   n  +  1   )            subscript  E  k     α    2  β        k  π     n  1         E_{k}=\alpha+2\beta\cos\frac{k\pi}{(n+1)}     :* Cyclic     E  k   =   α  +   2  β   cos    2  k  π   n           subscript  E  k     α    2  β        2  k  π   n        E_{k}=\alpha+2\beta\cos\frac{2k\pi}{n}     The energy levels for cyclic systems can be predicted using the Frost circle mnemonic. A circle centered at α with radius 2β is inscribed with a polygon with one vertex pointing down; the vertices represent energy levels with the appropriate energies. 7 A related mnemonic exists for linear systems. 8  Many predictions have been experimentally verified:   The HOMO–LUMO gap, in terms of the β constant, correlates directly with the respective molecular electronic transitions observed with UV/VIS spectroscopy . For linear polyenes , the energy gap is given as:        Δ  E   =   -   4  β   sin   π   2   (   n  +  1   )              normal-Δ  E       4  β      π    2    n  1          \Delta E=-4\beta\sin\frac{\pi}{2(n+1)}      from which a value for β can be obtained between −60 and −70 kcal / mol (−250 to −290 kJ /mol).

Educ.  1994 , 71, 171.     The predicted MO energies as stipulated by Koopmans' theorem correlate with photoelectron spectroscopy . 9  The Hückel delocalization energy correlates with the experimental heat of combustion . This energy is defined as the difference between the total predicted pi energy (in benzene 8β) and a hypothetical pi energy in which all ethylene units are assumed isolated, each contributing 2β (making benzene 3 × 2β = 6β).  Molecules with MO's paired up such that only the sign differs (for example α ± β) are called alternant hydrocarbons and have in common small molecular dipole moments . This is in contrast to non-alternant hydrocarbons, such as azulene and fulvene that have large dipole moments . The Hückel theory is more accurate for alternant hydrocarbons.  For cyclobutadiene the theory predicts that the two high-energy electrons occupy a degenerate pair of MO's that are neither stabilized or destabilized. Hence the square molecule would be a very reactive triplet diradical (the ground state is actually rectangular without degenerate orbitals). In fact, all cyclic conjugated hydrocarbons with a total of 4 n   π   π   \pi    electrons share this MO pattern, and this forms the basis of Hückel's rule .  Dewar reactivity numbers deriving from the Hückel approach correctly predict the reactivity of aromatic systems with nucleophiles and electrophiles .   Mathematics behind the Hückel method  The Hückel method can be derived from the Ritz method , with a few further assumptions concerning the overlap matrix S and the Hamiltonian matrix H .  It is assumed that the overlap matrix S is the identity matrix. This means that overlap between the orbitals is neglected and the orbitals are considered orthogonal. Then the generalised eigenvalue problem of the Ritz method turns into an eigenvalue problem.  The Hamiltonian matrix H = ( H ij ) is parametrised in the following way:   H ii = α for C atoms and α + h A β for other atoms A.    H ij = β if the two atoms are next to each other and both C , and k AB  β for other neighbouring atoms A and B.    H ij = 0 in any other case.   The orbitals are the eigenvectors , and the energies are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix. If the substance is a pure hydrocarbon, the problem can be solved without any knowledge about the parameters. For heteroatom systems, such as pyridine , values of h A and k AB have to be specified.
