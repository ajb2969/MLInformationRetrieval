   Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase      Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase   In enzymology , a Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-S-lactoylglutathione + water   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    glutathione + a 2-hydroxy carboxylate   Hence, this enzyme has two substrate , (R)-S-lactoylglutathione and water, and two products , glutathione and a 2-hydroxy carboxylate. With the common substrate methylglyoxal , the product is D-lactate . 1  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically the class of thioester lyases. This enzyme is commonly known as glyoxylase II . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.2  Category:Enzymes of known structure     ↩
