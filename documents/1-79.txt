Arithmetic–geometric mean

In mathematics, the arithmetic–geometric mean (AGM) of two positive real numbers

 
  and 
 
 
 
  is defined as follows:
First compute the arithmetic mean of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and call it . Next compute the geometric mean of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and call it ; this is the square root of the product 
 
 
 
 :



Then iterate this operation with  taking the place of 
 
 
 
  and  taking the place of 
 
 
 
 . In this way, two sequences  and  are defined:



These two sequences converge to the same number, which is the arithmetic–geometric mean of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ; it is denoted by 
 
 
 
 , or sometimes by 
 
 
 
 .
This can be used for algorithmic purposes as in the AGM method.
Example
To find the arithmetic–geometric mean of  24}} and  6}}, first calculate their arithmetic mean and geometric mean, thus:



and then iterate as follows:



The first five iterations give the following values:

As can be seen, the number of digits in agreement (underlined) approximately doubles with each iteration. The arithmetic–geometric mean of 24 and 6 is the common limit of these two sequences, which is approximately 13.4581714817256154207668131569743992430538388544.1
History
The first algorithm based on this sequence pair appeared in the works of Lagrange. Its properties were further analyzed by Gauss.2
Properties
The geometric mean of two positive numbers is never bigger than the arithmetic mean (see inequality of arithmetic and geometric means); as a consequence,  is an increasing sequence,  is a decreasing sequence, and . These are strict inequalities if 
 
 
 
 .


 
  is thus a number between the geometric and arithmetic mean of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ; in particular it is between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .
There is an integral-form expression for 
 
 
 
 :



where 
 
 
 
  is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind:



Indeed, since the arithmetic–geometric process converges so quickly, it provides an efficient way to compute elliptic integrals via this formula. In engineering, it is used for instance in elliptic filter design.3
Related concepts
The reciprocal of the arithmetic–geometric mean of 1 and the square root of 2 is called Gauss's constant, after Carl Friedrich Gauss.



The geometric–harmonic mean can be calculated by an analogous method, using sequences of geometric and harmonic means. The arithmetic–harmonic mean can be similarly defined, but takes the same value as the geometric mean.
The arithmetic–geometric mean can be used to compute logarithms and complete elliptic integrals of the first kind. A modified arithmetic–geometric mean can be used to efficiently compute complete elliptic integrals of the second kind.4
Proof of existence
From inequality of arithmetic and geometric means we can conclude that:



and thus



that is, the sequence  is nondecreasing.
Furthermore, it is easy to see that it is also bounded above by the larger of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (which follows from the fact that both arithmetic and geometric means of two numbers both lie between them). Thus by the monotone convergence theorem the sequence is convergent, so there exists a 
 
 
 
  such that:



However, we can also see that:



and so:



Q.E.D.
Proof of the integral-form expression
This proof is given by Gauss.5 Let



Changing the variable of integration to 
 
 
 
 , where



gives



Thus, we have


 
 
  The last equality comes from observing that 
 
 
 
 .
Finally, we obtain the desired result
