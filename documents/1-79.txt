   Arithmetic–geometric mean      Arithmetic–geometric mean   In mathematics , the arithmetic–geometric mean (AGM) of two positive real numbers    x   x   x   and   y   y   y   is defined as follows:  First compute the arithmetic mean of   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   and call it . Next compute the geometric mean of   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   and call it ; this is the square root of the product    x  y      x  y    xy   :      a  1     subscript  a  1    \displaystyle a_{1}     Then iterate this operation with taking the place of   x   x   x   and taking the place of   y   y   y   . In this way, two sequences  and are defined:      a   n  +  1      subscript  a    n  1     \displaystyle a_{n+1}     These two sequences converge to the same number, which is the arithmetic–geometric mean of   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   ; it is denoted by    M   (  x  ,  y  )       M   x  y     M(x,y)   , or sometimes by    a  g  m   (  x  ,  y  )       a  g  m   x  y     agm(x,y)   .  This can be used for algorithmic purposes as in the AGM method .  Example  To find the arithmetic–geometric mean of 24}} and 6}} , first calculate their arithmetic mean and geometric mean, thus:      a  1     subscript  a  1    \displaystyle a_{1}     and then iterate as follows:      a  2     subscript  a  2    \displaystyle a_{2}     The first five iterations give the following values:           n   n   n              0   24   6     1   5   2     2   .5   .416407864998738178455042…     3   203932499369089227521…   139030990984877207090…     4   45176983217305…   06053858316334…     5   20…   06…       As can be seen, the number of digits in agreement (underlined) approximately doubles with each iteration. The arithmetic–geometric mean of 24 and 6 is the common limit of these two sequences, which is approximately 13.4581714817256154207668131569743992430538388544. 1  History  The first algorithm based on this sequence pair appeared in the works of Lagrange . Its properties were further analyzed by Gauss . 2  Properties  The geometric mean of two positive numbers is never bigger than the arithmetic mean (see inequality of arithmetic and geometric means ); as a consequence, is an increasing sequence, is a decreasing sequence, and . These are strict inequalities if    x  ≠  y      x  normal-≠  y    x≠y   .      M   (  x  ,  y  )       M   x  y     M(x,y)   is thus a number between the geometric and arithmetic mean of   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   ; in particular it is between   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   .  If    r  ≥  0      r  normal-≥  0    r≥0   , then     M   (   r  x   ,   r  y   )    =   r  M   (  x  ,  y  )          M     r  x     r  y       r  M   x  y      M(rx,ry)=rM(x,y)   .  There is an integral-form expression for    M   (  x  ,  y  )       M   x  y     M(x,y)   :      M   (  x  ,  y  )       M   x  y     \displaystyle M(x,y)     where    K   (  k  )       K  k    K(k)   is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind :       K   (  k  )    =    ∫  0   π  2      d  θ     1  -    k  2     sin  2    (  θ  )               K  k     superscript   subscript   0     π  2        d  θ       1     superscript  k  2     superscript   2   θ          K(k)=\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{d\theta}{\sqrt{1-k^{2}\sin^{2}(\theta)}}     Indeed, since the arithmetic–geometric process converges so quickly, it provides an efficient way to compute elliptic integrals via this formula. In engineering, it is used for instance in elliptic filter design. 3  Related concepts  The reciprocal of the arithmetic–geometric mean of 1 and the square root of 2 is called Gauss's constant , after Carl Friedrich Gauss .       1   M   (  1  ,   2   )     =  G  =   0.8346268  …           1    M   1    2      G         0.8346268  normal-…      \frac{1}{M(1,\sqrt{2})}=G=0.8346268\dots     The geometric–harmonic mean can be calculated by an analogous method, using sequences of geometric and harmonic means. The arithmetic–harmonic mean can be similarly defined, but takes the same value as the geometric mean .  The arithmetic–geometric mean can be used to compute logarithms and complete elliptic integrals of the first kind . A modified arithmetic–geometric mean can be used to efficiently compute complete elliptic integrals of the second kind . 4  Proof of existence  From inequality of arithmetic and geometric means we can conclude that:       g  n   ⩽   a  n        subscript  g  n    subscript  a  n     g_{n}\leqslant a_{n}     and thus       g   n  +  1    =     g  n   ⋅   a  n     ⩾     g  n   ⋅   g  n     =   g  n          subscript  g    n  1       normal-⋅   subscript  g  n    subscript  a  n             normal-⋅   subscript  g  n    subscript  g  n           subscript  g  n      g_{n+1}=\sqrt{g_{n}\cdot a_{n}}\geqslant\sqrt{g_{n}\cdot g_{n}}=g_{n}     that is, the sequence is nondecreasing.  Furthermore, it is easy to see that it is also bounded above by the larger of   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   (which follows from the fact that both arithmetic and geometric means of two numbers both lie between them). Thus by the monotone convergence theorem the sequence is convergent, so there exists a   g   g   g   such that:        lim   n  →  ∞     g  n    =  g        subscript    normal-→  n      subscript  g  n    g    \lim_{n\to\infty}g_{n}=g     However, we can also see that:       a  n   =    g   n  +  1   2    g  n         subscript  a  n      superscript   subscript  g    n  1    2    subscript  g  n      a_{n}=\frac{g_{n+1}^{2}}{g_{n}}     and so:        lim   n  →  ∞     a  n    =    lim   n  →  ∞      g   n  +  1   2    g  n     =    g  2   g   =  g          subscript    normal-→  n      subscript  a  n      subscript    normal-→  n        superscript   subscript  g    n  1    2    subscript  g  n             superscript  g  2   g        g     \lim_{n\to\infty}a_{n}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{g_{n+1}^{2}}{g_{n}}=\frac{g^{2}}%
 {g}=g     Q.E.D.  Proof of the integral-form expression  This proof is given by Gauss. 5 Let        I   (  x  ,  y  )    =    ∫  0   π  /  2      d  θ       x  2     cos  2   θ    +    y  2     sin  2   θ         ,        I   x  y      superscript   subscript   0     π  2        d  θ          superscript  x  2     superscript   2   θ       superscript  y  2     superscript   2   θ          I(x,y)=\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\frac{d\theta}{\sqrt{x^{2}\cos^{2}\theta+y^{2}\sin^{2}%
 \theta}},     Changing the variable of integration to    θ  ′     superscript  θ  normal-′    \theta^{\prime}   , where        sin  θ   =    2  x   sin   θ  ′       (   x  +  y   )   +    (   x  -  y   )     sin  2    θ  ′        ,        θ       2  x     superscript  θ  normal-′         x  y       x  y     superscript   2    superscript  θ  normal-′         \sin\theta=\frac{2x\sin\theta^{\prime}}{(x+y)+(x-y)\sin^{2}\theta^{\prime}},     gives      I   (  x  ,  y  )       I   x  y     \displaystyle I(x,y)     Thus, we have      I   (  x  ,  y  )       I   x  y     \displaystyle I(x,y)   The last equality comes from observing that     I   (  z  ,  z  )    =   π  /   (   2  z   )          I   z  z      π    2  z      I(z,z)=\pi/(2z)   .  Finally, we obtain the desired result        M   (  x  ,  y  )    =   π  /   (   2  I   (  x  ,  y  )    )     .        M   x  y      π    2  I   x  y       M(x,y)=\pi/\bigl(2I(x,y)\bigr).
