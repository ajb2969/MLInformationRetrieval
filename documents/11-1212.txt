   Arylamine glucosyltransferase      Arylamine glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , an arylamine glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + an arylamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + an N-D-glucosylarylamine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and arylamine , whereas its two products are UDP and N-D-glucosylarylamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:arylamine N-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include UDP glucose-arylamine glucosyltransferase , and uridine diphosphoglucose-arylamine glucosyltransferase .
