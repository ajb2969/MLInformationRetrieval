In mathematics, the Euler function is given by


 
  Named after Leonhard Euler, it is a prototypical example of a q-series, a modular form, and provides the prototypical example of a relation between combinatorics and complex analysis.
Properties
The coefficient

 
  in the formal power series expansion for 
 
 
 
  gives the number of all partitions of k. That is,


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the partition function of k.
The Euler identity, also known as the Pentagonal number theorem is



Note that 
 
 
 
  is a pentagonal number.
The Euler function is related to the Dedekind eta function through a Ramanujan identity as



where 
 
 
 
 
  is the square of the nome.
Note that both functions have the symmetry of the modular group.
The Euler function may be expressed as a Q-Pochhammer symbol:



The logarithm of the Euler function is the sum of the logarithms in the product expression, each of which may be expanded about q=0, yielding:



which is a Lambert series with coefficients -1/n. The logarithm of the Euler function may therefore be expressed as:



where


 
  -[1/1, 3/2, 4/3, 7/4, 6/5, 12/6, 8/7, 15/8, 13/9, 18/10, ...] (see OEIS A000203)
On account of the following identity,



this may also be written as



Special values
The next identities come from Ramanujan's lost notebook, Part V, p. 326.
