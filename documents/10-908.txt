   Cis-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dehydrogenase      Cis-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a cis-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cis-1,2-dihydronaphthalene-1,2-diol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   naphthalene-1,2-diol + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cis-1,2-dihydronaphthalene-1,2-diol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are naphthalene-1,2-diol , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cis-1,2-dihydronaphthalene-1,2-diol:NAD+ 1,2-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include (+)-cis-naphthalene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase , naphthalene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase , and cis-dihydrodiol naphthalene dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene degradation and naphthalene and anthracene degradation .
