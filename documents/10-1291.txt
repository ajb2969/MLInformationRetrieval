Glutarate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a glutarate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

glutarate semialdehyde + NAD+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  glutarate + NADH + 2 H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are glutarate semialdehyde, NAD+, and H2O, whereas its 3 products are glutarate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glutarate-semialdehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called glutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in lysine degradation.
