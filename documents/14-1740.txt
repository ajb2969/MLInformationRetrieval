   Totative      Totative   __NOTOC__ In number theory , a totative of a given positive integer   n   n   n   is an integer   k   k   k   such that   k   k   k     The distribution of totatives has been a subject of study. Paul Erdős conjectured that, writing the totatives of n as        ∑   i  =  1     ϕ   (  n  )    -  1      (    a   i  +  1    -   a  i    )   2    <     C   n  2    /  ϕ    (  n  )          superscript   subscript     i  1        ϕ  n   1     superscript     subscript  a    i  1     subscript  a  i    2          C   superscript  n  2    ϕ   n     \sum_{i=1}^{\phi(n)-1}(a_{i+1}-a_{i})^{2}     the mean square gap satisfies  $$\sum_{i=1}^{\phi(n)-1} (a_{i+1}-a_i)^2 < C n^2 / \phi(n)$$  for some constant C and this was proved by Bob Vaughan and Hugh Montgomery . 1  See also   Reduced residue system   References     Further reading     External links      "  Category:Modular arithmetic     ↩
