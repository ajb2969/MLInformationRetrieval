Totative

__NOTOC__ In number theory, a totative of a given positive integer 
 
 
 
  is an integer 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 

The distribution of totatives has been a subject of study. Paul Erd≈ës conjectured that, writing the totatives of n as



the mean square gap satisfies
$$\sum_{i=1}^{\phi(n)-1} (a_{i+1}-a_i)^2 < C n^2 / \phi(n)$$
for some constant C and this was proved by Bob Vaughan and Hugh Montgomery.1
