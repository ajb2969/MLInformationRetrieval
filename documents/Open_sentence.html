<h1>Open sentence</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, an <strong>open sentence</strong> (usually an equation or equality) is described as "open" in the sense that its <a href="truth_value" title="wikilink">truth value</a> is meaningless until its variables are replaced with specific numbers, at which point the truth value can usually be determined (and hence the sentences are no longer regarded as "open"). These possible replacement values are assumed to range over a subset of either the real or complex numbers, depending on the equation or inequality under consideration (in applications, real numbers are usually associated also with measurement units). The replacement values which produce a true equation or inequality are called solutions of the equation or inequality, and are said to "satisfy" it.</p>

<p>In <a href="mathematical_logic" title="wikilink">mathematical logic</a>, a non-closed formula is a <a href="formula_(mathematical_logic)" title="wikilink">formula</a> which contains <a href="free_variable" title="wikilink">free variables</a>. (Note that in logic, a "<a href="sentence_(mathematical_logic)" title="wikilink">sentence</a>" is a formula <em>without</em> free variables, and a formula is "open" if it contains no <a href="Quantifier_(logic)" title="wikilink">quantifiers</a>, which disagrees with the terminology of this article.) Unlike closed formulas, which contain <a href="Constant_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">constants</a>, non-closed formulas do not express <a href="proposition" title="wikilink">propositions</a>; they are neither true nor false. Hence, the formula</p>

<p><mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>has no <a class="uri" href="truth-value" title="wikilink">truth-value</a>. A formula is said to be <em>satisfied</em> by any <a href="object_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">object</a>(s) such that if it is written in place of the variable(s), it will form a sentence expressing a true proposition. Hence, "5" satisfies (). Any sentence which results from a formula in such a way is said to be a <em><a href="substitution_instance" title="wikilink">substitution instance</a></em> of that formula. Hence, "5 is a number" is a substitution instance of ().</p>

<p>Mathematicians have not adopted that nomenclature, but refer instead to <em>equations</em>, <em>inequalities</em> with free variables, etc.</p>

<p>Such replacements are known as <em>solutions</em> to the sentence. An <em>identity</em> is an open sentence for which every number is a solution.</p>

<p>Examples of open sentences include:</p>
<ol>
<li>3<em>x</em> − 9 = 21, whose only solution for <em>x</em> is 10;</li>
<li>4<em>x</em> + 3 &gt; 9, whose solutions for <em>x</em> are all numbers greater than 3/2;</li>
<li><em>x</em> + <em>y</em> = 0, whose solutions for <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are all <a href="ordered_pair" title="wikilink">pairs</a> of numbers that are <a href="additive_inverse" title="wikilink">additive inverses</a>;</li>
<li>3<em>x</em> + 9 = 3(<em>x</em> + 3), whose solutions for <em>x</em> are all numbers.</li>
<li>3<em>x</em> + 9 = 3(<em>x</em> + 4), which has no solution.</li>
</ol>

<p>Example 4 is an <a href="Identity_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">identity</a>. Examples 1, 3, and 4 are <a href="equation" title="wikilink">equations</a>, while example 2 is an <a href="inequality_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">inequality</a>. Example 5 is a <a class="uri" href="contradiction" title="wikilink">contradiction</a>.</p>

<p>Every open sentence must have (usually implicitly) a <a href="Universe_of_discourse" title="wikilink"><em>universe of discourse</em></a> describing which numbers are under consideration as solutions. For instance, one might consider all <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real numbers</a> or only <a href="integer" title="wikilink">integers</a>. For example, in example 2 above, 1.6 is a solution if the universe of discourse is all real numbers, but not if the universe of discourse is only integers. In that case, only the integers greater than 3/2 are solutions: 2, 3, 4, and so on. On the other hand, if the universe of discourse consists of all <a href="complex_number" title="wikilink">complex numbers</a>, then example 2 doesn't even make sense (although the other examples do). An identity is only required to hold for the numbers in its universe of discourse.</p>

<p>This same <a href="universe_of_discourse" title="wikilink">universe of discourse</a> can be used to describe the solutions to the open sentence in <a href="First-order_logic" title="wikilink">symbolic logic</a> using <a href="universal_quantification" title="wikilink">universal quantification</a>. For example, the solution to example 2 above can be specified as:</p>
<dl>
<dd>For all <em>x</em>, 4<em>x</em> + 3 &gt; 9 <a href="if_and_only_if" title="wikilink">if and only if</a> <em>x</em> &gt; 3/2.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Here, the phrase "for all" implicitly requires a universe of discourse to specify <em>which</em> mathematical objects are "all" the possibilities for <em>x</em>.</p>

<p>The idea can even be generalised to situations where the variables don't refer to numbers at all, as in a <a href="functional_equation" title="wikilink">functional equation</a>. For an example of this, consider</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>f</em> * <em>f</em> = <em>f</em>,
</dd>
</dl>

<p>which says that <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) * <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) for every value of <em>x</em>. If the universe of discourse consists of all <a href="function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">functions</a> from the <a href="real_line" title="wikilink">real line</a> <strong>R</strong> to itself, then the solutions for <em>f</em> are all functions whose only values are <a href="1_(number)" title="wikilink">one</a> and <a href="0_(number)" title="wikilink">zero</a>. But if the universe of discourse consists of all <a href="continuous_function" title="wikilink">continuous functions</a> from <strong>R</strong> to itself, then the solutions for <em>f</em> are only the <a href="constant_function" title="wikilink">constant functions</a> with value one or zero.</p>
