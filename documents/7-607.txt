In this diagram 1 unit of space is the distance that light travels in 1 unit of time. For an object moving from point O in space-time to point A in space-time t3 units of proper time will elapse. The line     (    t  2   -   x  2   )  =  3     fragments    normal-(    superscript  t  2     superscript  x  2   normal-)   3    \sqrt{(}t^{2}-x^{2})=3   connects all the points in space-time that have in common that for an object moving from point O in space-time to any point on that line, 3 units of proper time elapse. In Minkowski space-time, the proper time is a measure of the amount of separation between points in space-time. The line     (    t  2   -   x  2   )  =  3     fragments    normal-(    superscript  t  2     superscript  x  2   normal-)   3    \sqrt{(}t^{2}-x^{2})=3   is a collection of all the points that are 3 units of proper time away from point O.
