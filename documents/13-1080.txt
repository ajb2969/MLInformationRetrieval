   Centre wavelength      Centre wavelength   The centre wavelength is the power- weighted mean  wavelength :       λ  c   =    1   P   t  o  t  a  l      ∫   p   (  λ  )    λ   d  λ          subscript  λ  c       1   subscript  P    t  o  t  a  l         p  λ  λ  d  λ       \lambda_{c}=\frac{1}{P_{total}}\int p(\lambda)\lambda\,d\lambda     And the total power is:       P   t  o  t  a  l    =   ∫   p   (  λ  )   d  λ         subscript  P    t  o  t  a  l        p  λ  d  λ      P_{total}=\int p(\lambda)d\lambda     where    p   (  λ  )       p  λ    p(\lambda)   is the power spectral density , for example in W/nm.  The above integrals theoretically extend over the entire spectrum, however it is usually sufficient to perform the integral over the spectrum where the spectral density    p   (  λ  )       p  λ    p(\lambda)   is higher than a fraction of its maximum.
