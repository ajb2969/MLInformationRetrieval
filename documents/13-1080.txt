Centre wavelength

The centre wavelength is the power-weighted mean wavelength:



And the total power is:



where 
 
 
 
  is the power spectral density, for example in W/nm.
The above integrals theoretically extend over the entire spectrum, however it is usually sufficient to perform the integral over the spectrum where the spectral density 
 
 
 
  is higher than a fraction of its maximum.
