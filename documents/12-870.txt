   Fourier transform on finite groups      Fourier transform on finite groups   In mathematics , the Fourier transform on finite groups is a generalization of the discrete Fourier transform from cyclic to arbitrary finite groups .  Definitions  The Fourier transform of a function    f  :   G  →   ℂ       normal-:  f   normal-→  G  ℂ     f:G\rightarrow\mathbb{C}\,   at a representation     ϱ  :   G  →   G  L   (   d  ϱ   ,  ℂ  )        normal-:  ϱ   normal-→  G    G  L    subscript  d  ϱ   ℂ       \varrho:G\rightarrow GL(d_{\varrho},\mathbb{C})\,   of    G    G   G\,   is         f  ^    (  ϱ  )    =    ∑   a  ∈  G     f   (  a  )   ϱ   (  a  )      .         normal-^  f   ϱ     subscript     a  G      f  a  ϱ  a      \widehat{f}(\varrho)=\sum_{a\in G}f(a)\varrho(a).     For each representation    ϱ    ϱ   \varrho\,   of    G    G   G\,   ,     f  ^    (  ϱ  )        normal-^  f   ϱ    \widehat{f}(\varrho)\,   is a     d  ϱ   ×    d  ϱ         subscript  d  ϱ    subscript  d  ϱ     d_{\varrho}\times d_{\varrho}\,   matrix, where     d  ϱ      subscript  d  ϱ    d_{\varrho}\,   is the degree of    ϱ    ϱ   \varrho\,   .  Let     ϱ  i      subscript  ϱ  i    \varrho_{i}\,   be a complete set of inequivalent irreducible representations of   G   G   G   . Then the matrix entries of the    ϱ  i     subscript  ϱ  i    \varrho_{i}   are mutually orthogonal functions on   G   G   G   . 1 Since the dimension of the transform space is equal to    |  G  |      G    |G|   , it follows that      ∑  i    d   ϱ  i   2    =   |  G  |         subscript   i    superscript   subscript  d   subscript  ϱ  i    2      G     \sum_{i}d_{\varrho_{i}}^{2}=|G|   .  The inverse Fourier transform at an element    a    a   a\,   of    G    G   G\,   is given by        f   (  a  )    =    1   |  G  |      ∑  i     d   ϱ  i    Tr   (    ϱ  i    (   a   -  1    )    f  ^    (   ϱ  i   )    )       .        f  a       1    G      subscript   i      subscript  d   subscript  ϱ  i    Tr     subscript  ϱ  i    superscript  a    1     normal-^  f    subscript  ϱ  i         f(a)=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{i}d_{\varrho_{i}}\text{Tr}\left(\varrho_{i}(a^{-1})%
 \widehat{f}(\varrho_{i})\right).     Properties  Transform of a convolution  The convolution of two functions     f  ,  g   :   G  →   ℂ       normal-:   f  g    normal-→  G  ℂ     f,g:G\rightarrow\mathbb{C}\,   is defined as         (   f  ∗  g   )    (  a  )    =    ∑   b  ∈  G     f   (   a   b   -  1     )   g   (  b  )      .         normal-∗  f  g   a     subscript     b  G      f    a   superscript  b    1     g  b      (f\ast g)(a)=\sum_{b\in G}f(ab^{-1})g(b).     The Fourier transform of a convolution at any representation    ϱ    ϱ   \varrho\,   of    G    G   G\,   is given by          f  ∗  g   ^    (  ϱ  )    =    f  ^    (  ϱ  )    g  ^    (  ϱ  )     .         normal-^   normal-∗  f  g    ϱ      normal-^  f   ϱ   normal-^  g   ϱ     \widehat{f\ast g}(\varrho)=\widehat{f}(\varrho)\widehat{g}(\varrho).     Plancherel formula  For functions     f  ,  g   :   G  →   ℂ       normal-:   f  g    normal-→  G  ℂ     f,g:G\rightarrow\mathbb{C}\,   , the Plancherel formula states         ∑   a  ∈  G     f   (   a   -  1    )   g   (  a  )     =    1   |  G  |      ∑  i     d   ϱ  i    Tr   (    f  ^    (   ϱ  i   )    g  ^    (   ϱ  i   )    )       ,        subscript     a  G      f   superscript  a    1    g  a        1    G      subscript   i      subscript  d   subscript  ϱ  i    Tr     normal-^  f    subscript  ϱ  i    normal-^  g    subscript  ϱ  i         \sum_{a\in G}f(a^{-1})g(a)=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{i}d_{\varrho_{i}}\text{Tr}\left(%
 \widehat{f}(\varrho_{i})\widehat{g}(\varrho_{i})\right),     where     ϱ  i      subscript  ϱ  i    \varrho_{i}\,   are the irreducible representations of    G  .    G   G.\,     Fourier transform on finite abelian groups  Since the irreducible representations of finite abelian groups are all of degree 1 and hence equal to the irreducible characters of the group, Fourier analysis on finite abelian groups is significantly simplified. For instance, the Fourier transform yields a scalar- and not matrix-valued function.  Furthermore, the irreducible characters of a group may be put in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of the group.  Therefore, we may define the Fourier transform for finite abelian groups as         f  ^    (  s  )    =    ∑   a  ∈  G     f   (  a  )     χ  s   ¯    (  a  )      .         normal-^  f   s     subscript     a  G      f  a   normal-¯   subscript  χ  s    a      \widehat{f}(s)=\sum_{a\in G}f(a)\bar{\chi_{s}}(a).     Note that the right-hand side is simply    ⟨  f  ,   χ  s   ⟩     f   subscript  χ  s     \langle f,\chi_{s}\rangle   for the inner product on the vector space of functions from    G    G   G\,   to    ℂ    ℂ   \mathbb{C}\,   defined by        ⟨  f  ,  g  ⟩   =    ∑   a  ∈  G     f   (  a  )    g  ¯    (  a  )      .       f  g     subscript     a  G      f  a   normal-¯  g   a      \langle f,g\rangle=\sum_{a\in G}f(a)\bar{g}(a).     The inverse Fourier transform is then given by        f   (  a  )    =    1   |  G  |      ∑   s  ∈  G      f  ^    (  s  )    χ  s    (  a  )       .        f  a       1    G      subscript     s  G       normal-^  f   s   subscript  χ  s   a       f(a)=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{s\in G}\widehat{f}(s)\chi_{s}(a).     A property that is often useful in probability is that the Fourier transform of the uniform distribution is simply     δ   a  ,  0    ,     subscript  δ   a  0     \delta_{a,0},\,   where 0 is the group identity and     δ   i  ,  j       subscript  δ   i  j     \delta_{i,j}\,   is the Kronecker delta .  Applications  This generalization of the discrete Fourier transform is used in numerical analysis . A circulant matrix is a matrix where every column is a cyclic shift of the previous one. Circulant matrices can be diagonalized quickly using the fast Fourier transform , and this yields a fast method for solving systems of linear equations with circulant matrices. Similarly, the Fourier transform on arbitrary groups can be used to give fast algorithms for matrices with other symmetries . These algorithms can be used for the construction of numerical methods for solving partial differential equations that preserve the symmetries of the equations .
