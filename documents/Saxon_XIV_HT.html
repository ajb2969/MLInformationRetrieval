T</strong> locomotives were six-coupled <a href="tank_engine" title="wikilink">tank engines</a> operated by the <a href="Royal_Saxon_State_Railways" title="wikilink">Royal Saxon State Railways</a> for mixed duties on main and branch lines. In 1925, the <a href="Deutsche_Reichsbahn" title="wikilink">Deutsche Reichsbahn</a> grouped them into their <strong>DRG Class 75.5</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>As a successor to the four-coupled <a href="Saxon_IV_T" title="wikilink">Saxon Class IV T</a> the <a href="Sächsische_Maschinenfabrik" title="wikilink">Sächsische Maschinenfabrik</a> in <a class="uri" href="Chemnitz" title="wikilink">Chemnitz</a> developed a six-coupled <a href="tank_locomotive" title="wikilink">tank locomotive</a>. This new engine was primarily intended to be used in charge of suburban trains in the big conurbations.</p>

<p>From 1911 to 1921, 106 of these locomotives, built in three series, were placed in service by the Royal Saxon State Railways. At the time of its appearance, the Saxon XIV HT was the heaviest <a class="uri" href="2-6-2" title="wikilink">2-6-2</a> in central Europe. Not only were these locomotives used to haul suburban services, but in the end they were put in charge of all types of passenger trains on branch and main lines in <a href="Kingdom_of_Saxony" title="wikilink">Saxony's</a> central mountains.</p>

<p>After <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> some of the locomotives had to be handed over to <a class="uri" href="Poland" title="wikilink">Poland</a>, <a class="uri" href="Belgium" title="wikilink">Belgium</a> and <a class="uri" href="France" title="wikilink">France</a> as <a href="World_War_I_reparations" title="wikilink">reparations</a> in accordance with the terms of the <a href="Versailles_Treaty" title="wikilink">Versailles Treaty</a>. As a result, in 1920, the newly founded <a href="Deutsche_Reichsbahn" title="wikilink">Deutsche Reichsbahn</a> could only muster 83 locomotives of this class into its fleet, which they grouped in 1925 into their Class 75.5.</p>

<p>The locomotives left in Poland later went into the <a href="Polskie_Koleje_Państwowe" title="wikilink">Polish State Railway</a>, PKP, and were given numbers OKl101-01 to 11. The Belgian <em><a class="uri" href="État-Belge" title="wikilink">État-Belge</a></em> gave their four confiscated machines the numbers 9670, 9674, 9676 and 9686. A further eight locomotives ended up in the <em><a href="Chemins_de_Fer_de_l'État" title="wikilink">Chemins de Fer de l'État</a></em> under the numbers 32-916 to 32-923.</p>

<p>After the end of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> 88 locomotives went into the <a href="Deutsche_Reichsbahn_(GDR)" title="wikilink">Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR)</a> in <a href="East_Germany" title="wikilink">East Germany</a>. Amongst them were several engines that had been handed over to Poland and France in 1918. In 1968, there were still 25 machines in working condition, but they were retired soon thereafter.</p>

<p>Two locomotives have been preserved: number 75 501 by the <a href="German_Steam_Locomotive_Museum" title="wikilink">German Steam Locomotive Museum</a> at <a class="uri" href="Neuenmarkt" title="wikilink">Neuenmarkt</a>-<a class="uri" href="Wirsberg" title="wikilink">Wirsberg</a>, which was loaned to the <a href="Schwarzenberg/Erzgeb." title="wikilink">Schwarzenberg</a> railway museum in 2002 and number 75 515 by the <a href="Saxon_Railway_Museum" title="wikilink">Saxon Railway Museum</a> in <a class="uri" href="Chemnitz" title="wikilink">Chemnitz</a>-Hilbersdorf, which was badly damaged in a shunting accident on 14 June 1983 at <a href="Chemnitz_Hauptbahnhof" title="wikilink">Karl-Marx-Stadt Hauptbahnhof</a>.</p>
<h2 id="technical-features">Technical features</h2>

<p>The locomotives had a <a class="uri" href="boiler" title="wikilink">boiler</a> barrel, made from two shells, as well as two <a href="steam_domes" title="wikilink">steam domes</a>, which were linked by an internal connecting pipe. The boiler feed was achieved using <a href="injector" title="wikilink">injectors</a>, but from locomotive number 1856 they were given Knorr feed pumps with a preheater located transversely under the boiler. Later the preheater was positioned on the left hand side next to the chimney on all locomotives, which gave them their characteristic appearance. <em>Schmidt</em> <a class="uri" href="superheaters" title="wikilink">superheaters</a> were used.</p>

<p>The steam engine itself comprised a two-<a href="cylinder_(locomotive)" title="wikilink">cylinder</a> engine with simple steam expansion and <a href="Heusinger_valve_gear" title="wikilink">Heusinger valve gear</a>. The engine drove the second (middle) <a href="coupled_axle" title="wikilink">coupled axle</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="driving_axles" title="wikilink">driving axles</a> were fixed rigidly into the <a href="locomotive_frame" title="wikilink">locomotive frame</a>. To improve curve running the wheel flanges of the driving wheels were reduced. The <a href="carrying_axles" title="wikilink">carrying axles</a> were designed as <a href="Adams_axles" title="wikilink">Adams axles</a> and had leaf return springs.</p>

<p>A Westinghouse <a href="compressed-air_brake" title="wikilink">compressed-air brake</a> was installed as the locomotive brake. The air pump was originally on the left of the <a class="uri" href="smokebox" title="wikilink">smokebox</a>; later it was moved to the right.</p>

<p>Nine cubic metres of water were carried in two side tanks and a well tank located in the frame. The coal bunker was behind the driver's cab.</p>

<p>For branch line duties, all machines were equipped with a steam-operated bell.</p>
