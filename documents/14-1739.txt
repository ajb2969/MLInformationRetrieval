Reward-based selection

Reward-based selection is a technique used in evolutionary algorithms for selecting potentially useful solutions for recombination. The probability of being selected for an individual is proportional to the cumulative reward, obtained by the individual. The cumulative reward can be computed as a sum of the individual reward and the reward, inherited from parents.
Description
Reward-based selection can be used within Multi-armed bandit framework for Multi-objective optimization to obtain a better approximation of the Pareto front. 1
The newborn 
 
 
 
  and its parents receive a reward 
 
 
 
 , if 
 
 
 
  was selected for new population 
 
 
 
 , otherwise the reward is zero. Several reward definitions are possible:

1. 
 
 
 
 , if the newborn individual 
 
 
 
  was selected for new population 
 
 
 
 .
2. 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the rank of newly inserted individual in the population of 
 
 
 
  individuals. Rank can be computed using a well-known non-dominated sorting procedure.2
3. 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the hypervolume indicator contribution of the individual 
 
 
 
  to the population 
 
 
 
 . The reward 
 
 
 
  if the newly inserted individual improves the quality of the population, which is measured as its hypervolume contribution in the objective space.
4. A relaxation of the above reward, involving a rank-based penalization for points for 
 
 
 
 -th dominated Pareto front
 
 


Reward-based selection can quickly identify the most fruitful directions of search by maximizing the cumulative reward of individuals.
