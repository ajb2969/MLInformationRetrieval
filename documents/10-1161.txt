A quantity is said to be subject to exponential decay if it decreases at a rate proportional to its value. Symbolically, this can be expressed as the following differential equation , where N is the quantity and λ is a positive number called the decay constant :         d  N    d  t    =   -   λ  N     .          d  N     d  t        λ  N      \frac{dN}{dt}=-\lambda N.     The solution to this equation is:      N  =    N  0     e   -   λ  t           N     subscript  N  0    superscript  e      λ  t        N=N_{0}e^{-\lambda t}\,   , where, for a given sample of carbonaceous matter:      N  0     subscript  N  0    N_{0}   = number of radiocarbon atoms at    t  =  0      t  0    t=0   , i.e. the origin of the disintegration time ,     N   N   N   = number of radiocarbon atoms remaining after radioactive decay during the time    t   t   t   ,      λ  =       λ  absent    {\lambda}=   radiocarbon decay or disintegration constant .   Two related times can be defined:  mean- or average-life: mean or average time each radiocarbon atom spends in a given sample until it decays.  half-life: time lapsed for half the number of radiocarbon atoms in a given sample, to decay,     It can be shown that:       t   a  v  g       subscript  t    a  v  g     t_{avg}\,   =    1  λ      1  λ    \frac{1}{\lambda}   = radiocarbon mean- or average-life = 8033 years (Libby value)       t   1  2       subscript  t    1  2     t_{\frac{1}{2}}\,   =     t   a  v  g    ⋅   ln  2      normal-⋅   subscript  t    a  v  g      2     t_{avg}\cdot\ln 2   = radiocarbon half-life = 5568 years (Libby value)  Notice that dates are customarily given in years BP which implies t(BP) = -t because the time arrow for dates runs in reverse direction from the time arrow for the corresponding ages . From these considerations and the above equation, it results:  For a raw radiocarbon date:       t   (   B  P   )    =    1  λ    ln   N   N  0            t    B  P        1  λ       N   subscript  N  0        t(BP)=\frac{1}{\lambda}{\ln\frac{N}{N_{0}}}   and for a raw radiocarbon age:       t   (   B  P   )    =   -    1  λ    ln   N   N  0             t    B  P          1  λ       N   subscript  N  0         t(BP)=-\frac{1}{\lambda}{\ln\frac{N}{N_{0}}}     Thermodynamics  Laws of thermodynamics   Laws of thermodynamics   :* Zeroth law of thermodynamics  :*    A  ∼   B  ∧  B   ∼  C  ⇒  A  ∼  C       similar-to  A    B  B     similar-to    C    normal-⇒    A    similar-to    C     A\sim B\wedge B\sim C\Rightarrow A\sim C     :* First law of thermodynamics  :*     d  U   =    δ  Q   -   δ   W           normal-d  U       δ  Q     δ  W      \mathrm{d}U=\delta Q-\delta W\,     :* Second law of thermodynamics  :*     ∮    δ  Q   T    ≥  0       contour-integral      δ  Q   T    0    \oint\frac{\delta Q}{T}\geq 0     :* Third law of thermodynamics  :*     T  →  0   ,   S  →  C      formulae-sequence   normal-→  T  0    normal-→  S  C     T\rightarrow 0,S\rightarrow C     Identities   Work (thermodynamics)   Chemical thermodynamics studies PV work , which occurs when the volume of a fluid changes. PV work is represented by the following differential equation :       d  W   =   -   P  d   V           d  W       P  d  V      dW=-PdV\,     where:   W = work done on the system  P = external pressure  V = volume   Therefore, we have:      W  =   -    ∫   V  i    V  f      P   d  V         W      superscript   subscript    subscript  V  i     subscript  V  f      P  d  V       W=-\int_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}}P\,dV      Entropy   Entropy (classical thermodynamics)    Clausius defined the change in entropy  ds of a thermodynamic system, during a reversible process , as       d  S   =     δ  Q   T          d  S       δ  Q   T     dS=\frac{\delta Q}{T}\!   where   δ Q is a small amount of heat introduced to the system,  T is a constant absolute temperature    Note that the small amount    δ  Q      δ  Q    \delta Q   of energy transferred by heating is denoted by    δ  Q      δ  Q    \delta Q   rather than    d  Q      d  Q    dQ   , because Q is not a state function while the entropy is.   Enthalpy   The function H was introduced by the Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in early 20th century in the following form:       H  =   E  +   p  V     ,      H    E    p  V      H=E+pV,\,     where E represents the energy of the system. In the absence of an external field, the enthalpy may be defined, as it is generally known, by:       H  =   U  +   p  V     ,      H    U    p  V      H=U+pV,\,      Internal energy   The internal energy is essentially defined by the first law of thermodynamics which states that energy is conserved:       Δ  U   =   Q  +  W  +    W  ′           normal-Δ  U     Q  W   superscript  W  normal-′      \Delta U=Q+W+W^{\prime}\,     where   Δ U is the change in internal energy of a system during a process.    Q is heat  added to a system (measured in joules in SI ); that is, a positive value for Q represents heat flow into a system while a negative value denotes heat flow out of a system.    W is the mechanical work  done on a system (measured in joules in SI)    ''W' '' is energy added by all other processes   Although the internal energy is not exactly measurable, it may be expressed in terms of other similarly unmeasurable quantities. Using the above two equations in the first law of thermodynamics to construct one possible expression for the internal energy of a closed system gives:       d  U   =    δ  Q   -   d  W    =    T  d  S   -   p  d   V             normal-d  U       δ  Q     d  W             T  normal-d  S     p  normal-d  V       \mathrm{d}U=\delta Q-dW=T\mathrm{d}S-p\mathrm{d}V\,      Gibbs free energy        Δ  G   =    Δ  H   -   T  Δ   S           normal-Δ  G       normal-Δ  H     T  normal-Δ  S      \Delta G=\Delta H-T\Delta S\,   for constant temperature       Δ   G  ∘    =   -   R  T   ln   K            normal-Δ   superscript  G         R  T    K       \Delta G^{\circ}=-RT\ln K\,          Δ  G   =    Δ   G  ∘    +   R  T   ln   Q            normal-Δ  G       normal-Δ   superscript  G       R  T    Q       \Delta G=\Delta G^{\circ}+RT\ln Q\,          Δ  G   =   -   n  F  Δ   E           normal-Δ  G       n  F  normal-Δ  E      \Delta G=-nF\Delta E\,     and rearranging gives       n  F  Δ   E  ∘    =   R  T   ln   K           n  F  normal-Δ   superscript  E       R  T    K      nF\Delta E^{\circ}=RT\ln K\,          n  F  Δ  E   =    n  F  Δ   E  ∘    -   R  T   ln   Q            n  F  normal-Δ  E       n  F  normal-Δ   superscript  E       R  T    Q       nF\Delta E=nF\Delta E^{\circ}-RT\ln Q\,\,          Δ  E   =    Δ   E  ∘    -     R  T    n  F     ln   Q            normal-Δ  E       normal-Δ   superscript  E           R  T     n  F      Q       \Delta E=\Delta E^{\circ}-\frac{RT}{nF}\ln Q\,\,     which relates the electrical potential of a reaction to the equilibrium coefficient for that reaction.  where  Δ G = change in Gibbs free energy, Δ H = change in enthalpy , T = absolute temperature , Δ S = change in entropy , R = gas constant , ln = natural logarithm , K = equilibrium constant , Q = reaction quotient , n = number of electrons per mole product, F = Faraday constant ( coulombs per mole ), and Δ E = electrical potential of the reaction . Moreover, we also have:       K   e  q    =   e   -    Δ   G  ∘     R  T           subscript  K    e  q     superscript  e        normal-Δ   superscript  G       R  T        K_{eq}=e^{-\frac{\Delta G^{\circ}}{RT}}          Δ   G  ∘    =   -   R  T   (   ln   K   e  q     )     =   -   2.303  R  T   (   log   K   e  q     )             normal-Δ   superscript  G         R  T     subscript  K    e  q                2.303  R  T     subscript  K    e  q          \Delta G^{\circ}=-RT(\ln K_{eq})=-2.303RT(\log K_{eq})     which relates the equilibrium constant with Gibbs free energy.   Helmholtz free energy   The Helmholtz energy is defined as:      A  ≡   U  -   T   S         A    U    T  S      A\equiv U-TS\,    1  From the first law of thermodynamics we have:       d  U   =    δ  Q   -   δ   W           normal-d  U       δ  Q     δ  W      {\rm d}U=\delta Q-\delta W\,     where   U   U   U   is the internal energy,    δ  Q      δ  Q    \delta Q   is the energy added by heating and     δ  W   =   p  d  V         δ  W     p  normal-d  V     \delta W=p{\rm d}V   is the work done by the system .

Differentiating the expression for   A   A   A   we have:       d  A   =    d  U   -   (    T  d  S   +   S  d  T    )          normal-d  A       normal-d  U       T  normal-d  S     S  normal-d  T       {\rm d}A={\rm d}U-(T{\rm d}S+S{\rm d}T)\,          =    (    T  d  S   -    p   d  V    )   -   T  d  S   -   S  d   T         absent        T  normal-d  S     p  normal-d  V      T  normal-d  S     S  normal-d  T      =(T{\rm d}S-p\,{\rm d}V)-T{\rm d}S-S{\rm d}T\,          =    -    p   d  V    -   S  d   T         absent        p  normal-d  V      S  normal-d  T      =-p\,{\rm d}V-S{\rm d}T\,     Maxwell relations  The four most common Maxwell relations are the equalities of the second derivatives of each of the four thermodynamic potentials, with respect to their thermal natural variable (temperature T or entropy S ) and their mechanical natural variable (pressure p or volume V ):        (    ∂  T    ∂  V    )   S   =  -    (    ∂  p    ∂  S    )   V   =     ∂  2   U     ∂  S    ∂  V        fragments   subscript   fragments  normal-(      T     V    normal-)   S      subscript   fragments  normal-(      p     S    normal-)   V   italic-       superscript   2   U       S     V       \left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial V}\right)_{S}=-\left(\frac{\partial p}{%

A is equal to the multiple paths taken by the chemical compound , in open tubular  capillaries this term will be zero as there are no multiple paths. The multiple paths occur in packed columns where several routes through the column packing, which results in band spreading.  B/ u is equal to the longitudinal diffusion of the particles of the compound.  C u is equal to the equilibration point. In a column, there is an interaction between the mobile and stationary phases, C u accounts for this.
