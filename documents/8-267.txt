   Constant of motion      Constant of motion   In mechanics , a constant of motion is a quantity that is conserved throughout the motion, imposing in effect a constraint on the motion. However, it is a mathematical constraint, the natural consequence of the equations of motion , rather than a physical  constraint (which would require extra constraint forces ). Common examples include specific energy , specific linear momentum , specific angular momentum and the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector (for inverse-square force laws ).  Applications  Constants of motion are useful because they allow properties of the motion to be derived without solving the equations of motion . In fortunate cases, even the trajectory of the motion can be derived as the intersection of isosurfaces corresponding to the constants of motion. For example, Poinsot's construction shows that the torque-free rotation of a rigid body is the intersection of a sphere (conservation of total angular momentum) and an ellipsoid (conservation of energy), a trajectory that might be otherwise hard to derive and visualize. Therefore, the identification of constants of motion is an important objective in mechanics .  Methods for identifying constants of motion  There are several methods for identifying constants of motion.   The simplest but least systematic approach is the intuitive ("psychic") derivation, in which a quantity is hypothesized to be constant (perhaps because of experimental data ) and later shown mathematically to be conserved throughout the motion.    The Hamilton–Jacobi equations provide a commonly used and straightforward method for identifying constants of motion, particularly when the Hamiltonian adopts recognizable functional forms in orthogonal coordinates .    Another approach is to recognize that a conserved quantity corresponds to a symmetry of the Lagrangian . Noether's theorem provides a systematic way of deriving such quantities from the symmetry. For example, conservation of energy results from the invariance of the Lagrangian under shifts in the origin of time , conservation of linear momentum results from the invariance of the Lagrangian under shifts in the origin of space ( translational symmetry ) and conservation of angular momentum results from the invariance of the Lagrangian under rotations . The converse is also true; every symmetry of the Lagrangian corresponds to a constant of motion, often called a conserved charge or current .    A quantity   A   A   A   is conserved if it is not explicitly time-dependent and if its Poisson bracket with the Hamiltonian is zero         d  A    d  t    =     ∂  A    ∂  t    +   {  A  ,  H  }            d  A     d  t          A     t     A  H      \frac{dA}{dt}=\frac{\partial A}{\partial t}+\{A,H\}     Another useful result is Poisson's theorem , which states that if two quantities   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are constants of motion, so is their Poisson bracket    {  A  ,  B  }     A  B    \{A,B\}   .  A system with n degrees of freedom, and n constants of motion, such that the Poisson bracket of any pair of constants of motion vanishes, is known as a completely integrable system . Such a collection of constants of motion are said to be in involution with each other.  In quantum mechanics  An observable quantity Q will be a constant of motion if it commutes with the hamiltonian , H , and it does not itself depend explicitly on time. This is because          d   d  t     ⟨  ψ  |  Q  |  ψ  ⟩    =      -  1    i  ℏ     ⟨  ψ  |   [  H  ,  Q  ]   |  ψ  ⟩    +   ⟨  ψ  |    d  Q    d  t    |  ψ  ⟩            d    d  t     quantum-operator-product  ψ  Q  ψ            1     i  Planck-constant-over-2-pi     quantum-operator-product  ψ   H  Q   ψ     quantum-operator-product  ψ      d  Q     d  t    ψ      \frac{d}{dt}\langle\psi|Q|\psi\rangle=\frac{-1}{i\hbar}\langle\psi|\left[H,Q%

Relevance for quantum chaos  In general, an integrable system has constants of motion other than the energy. By contrast, energy is the only constant of motion in a non-integrable system ; such systems are termed chaotic. In general, a classical mechanical system can be quantized only if it is integrable; as of 2006, there is no known consistent method for quantizing chaotic dynamical systems.  Integral of motion  A constant of motion may be defined in a given force field as any function of phase-space coordinates (position and velocity, or position and momentum) and time that is constant throughout a trajectory. A subset of the constants of motion are the integrals of motion , or first integrals , defined as any functions of only the phase-space coordinates that are constant along an orbit. Every integral of motion is a constant of motion, but the converse is not true because a constant of motion may depend on time. 1 Examples of integrals of motion are the angular momentum vector,    𝐋  =   𝐱  ×  𝐯       𝐋    𝐱  𝐯     \mathbf{L}=\mathbf{x}\times\mathbf{v}   , or a Hamiltonian without time dependence, such as     H   (  𝐱  ,  𝐯  )    =     1  2    v  2    +  Φ         H   𝐱  𝐯          1  2    superscript  v  2    normal-Φ     H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})=\frac{1}{2}v^{2}+\Phi   . An example of a function that is a constant of motion but not an integral of motion would be the function     C   (  x  ,  v  ,  t  )    =   x  -   v  t          C   x  v  t      x    v  t      C(x,v,t)=x-vt   for an object moving at a constant speed in one dimension.
