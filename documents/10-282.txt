   Tilted large deviation principle      Tilted large deviation principle   In mathematics — specifically, in large deviations theory — the tilted large deviation principle is a result that allows one to generate a new large deviation principle from an old one by "tilting", i.e. integration against an exponential  functional . It can be seen as an alternative formulation of Varadhan's lemma .  Statement of the theorem  Let X be a Polish space (i.e., a separable , completely metrizable  topological space ), and let ( μ ε ) ε >0 be a family of probability measures on X that satisfies the large deviation principle with rate function  I : X → [0, +∞]. Let F : X → R be a continuous function that is bounded from above. For each Borel set S ⊆ X , let        J  ε    (  S  )    =    ∫  S      e   -    F   (  x  )    /  ε      d   μ  ε    (  x  )            subscript  J  ε   S     subscript   S      superscript  e        F  x   ε     normal-d   subscript  μ  ε   x      J_{\varepsilon}(S)=\int_{S}e^{-F(x)/\varepsilon}\,\mathrm{d}\mu_{\varepsilon}(x)     and define a new family of probability measures ( ν ε ) ε >0 on X by         ν  ε    (  S  )    =     J  ε    (  S  )      J  ε    (  X  )      .         subscript  ν  ε   S        subscript  J  ε   S      subscript  J  ε   X      \nu_{\varepsilon}(S)=\frac{J_{\varepsilon}(S)}{J_{\varepsilon}(X)}.     Then ( ν ε ) ε >0 satisfies the large deviation principle on X with rate function I F : X → [0, +∞] given by         I  F    (  x  )    =     sup   y  ∈  X     [    F   (  y  )    -   I   (  y  )     ]    -   [    F   (  x  )    -   I   (  x  )     ]     .         superscript  I  F   x       subscript  supremum    y  X     delimited-[]      F  y     I  y       delimited-[]      F  x     I  x        I^{F}(x)=\sup_{y\in X}\big[F(y)-I(y)\big]-\big[F(x)-I(x)\big].
