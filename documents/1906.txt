   Accumulation/distribution index      Accumulation/distribution index   The accumulation/distribution line or accumulation/distribution index is a technical analysis indicator intended to relate price and volume in the stock market .  Formula       C  L  V   =     (    c  l  o  s  e   -   l  o  w    )   -   (    h  i  g  h   -   c  l  o  s  e    )      h  i  g  h   -   l  o  w           C  L  V           c  l  o  s  e     l  o  w        h  i  g  h     c  l  o  s  e         h  i  g  h     l  o  w       CLV={(close-low)-(high-close)\over high-low}     This ranges from -1 when the close is the low of the day, to +1 when it's the high. For instance if the close is 3/4 the way up the range then CLV is +0.5. The accumulation/distribution index adds up volume multiplied by the CLV factor, i.e.       a  c  c  d  i  s  t   =    a  c  c  d  i  s   t   p  r  e  v     +     v  o  l  u  m  e   ×  C   L  V          a  c  c  d  i  s  t       a  c  c  d  i  s   subscript  t    p  r  e  v           v  o  l  u  m  e   C   L  V      accdist=accdist_{prev}+volume\times CLV     The starting point for the acc/dist total, i.e. the zero point, is arbitrary, only the shape of the resulting indicator is used, not the actual level of the total.  The name accumulation/distribution comes from the idea that during accumulation buyers are in control and the price will be bid up through the day, or will make a recovery if sold down, in either case more often finishing near the day's high than the low. The opposite applies during distribution.  The accumulation/distribution index is similar to on balance volume , but acc/dist is based on the close within the day's range, instead of the close-to-close up or down that the latter uses.  Chaikin oscillator  A Chaikin oscillator is formed by subtracting a 10-day exponential moving average from a 3-day exponential moving average of the accumulation/distribution index. Being an indicator of an indicator, it can give various sell or buy signals, depending on the context and other indicators.
