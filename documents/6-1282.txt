Sigma Andromedae

Sigma Andromedae (σ And, σ Andromedae) is the Bayer designation for a star in the northern constellation of Andromeda. It has an apparent visual magnitude of +4.5,1 which is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye from most locations. Parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission place it at a distance of about .2 The magnitude of the star is diminished by 0.08 from extinction caused by intervening gas and dust.3
This star has a stellar classification of A2 V,4 which matches the spectrum of an A-type main sequence star. It is about 450 million years old5 and is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 123 km/s.6 The interferometry-measured angular diameter of this star is 0.465 mas,7 which, at its estimated distance, equates to a physical radius of about 2.1 times the radius of the Sun.8 It is radiating 269 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer atmosphere at a temperature of 8,929 K,10 giving it the white-hued glow of an A-type star.11
In the past, radial velocity variations have been reported, but this remains unconfirmed. The star does not show any significant photometric variations and is used as a ubvy standard star.12 Sigma Andromedae is a candidate for membership in the stream of stars associated with the Ursa Major Moving Group. This is a set of stars that share a common motion through space, which suggests they originated together.13
Naming
In Chinese,  (), meaning Celestial Stable, refers to an asterism consisting of σ Andromedae, θ Andromedae and ρ Andromedae. Consequently, σ Andromedae itself is known as  (, .)14
