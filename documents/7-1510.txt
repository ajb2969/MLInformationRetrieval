Knight's graph

In graph theory, a knight's graph, or a knight's tour graph, is a graph that represents all legal moves of the knight chess piece on a chessboard where each vertex represents a square on a chessboard and each edge is a legal move. More specifically, an 
 
 
 
  knight's tour graph is a knight's tour graph of an 
 
 
 
  chessboard.1
For a 
 
 
 
  knight's tour graph the total number of vertices is simply 
 
 
 
 . For a 
 
 
 
 
  knight's tour graph the total number of vertices is simply 
 
 
 
  and the total number of edges is 
 
 
 
 .2
A Hamiltonian path on the knight's tour graph is a knight's tour.3 Schwenk's theorem characterizes the sizes of chessboard for which a knight's tour exist.4
