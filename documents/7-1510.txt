   Knight's graph      Knight's graph   In graph theory , a knight's graph , or a knight's tour graph , is a graph that represents all legal moves of the knight  chess  piece on a chessboard where each vertex represents a square on a chessboard and each edge is a legal move. More specifically, an    n  ×  m      n  m    n\times m   knight's tour graph is a knight's tour graph of an    n  ×  m      n  m    n\times m   chessboard. 1  For a    n  ×  m      n  m    n\times m   knight's tour graph the total number of vertices is simply    n  m      n  m    nm   . For a    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n   knight's tour graph the total number of vertices is simply    n  2     superscript  n  2    n^{2}   and the total number of edges is    4   (   n  -  2   )    (   n  -  1   )       4    n  2     n  1     4(n-2)(n-1)   . 2  A Hamiltonian path on the knight's tour graph is a knight's tour . 3  Schwenk's theorem characterizes the sizes of chessboard for which a knight's tour exist. 4  References  See also   King's graph  Rook's graph   "  Category:Mathematical chess problems  Category:Parametric families of graphs     . ↩  ↩   . ↩
