State-transition equation

The state-transition equation is defined as the solution of the linear homogeneous state equation. The linear time-invariant state equation given by


 
  with state vector x, control vector u, vector w of additive disturbances, and fixed matrices A, B, and E, can be solved by using either the classical method of solving linear differential equations or the Laplace transform method. The Laplace transform solution is presented in the following equations. The Laplace transform of the above equation yields


 
  where x(0) denotes initial-state vector evaluated at 
 
 
 
  . Solving for 
 
 
 
  gives


 
  So, the state-transition equation can be obtained by taking inverse Laplace transform as



The state-transition equation as derived above is useful only when the initial time is defined to be at 
 
 
 
  . In the study of control systems, specially discrete-data control systems, it is often desirable to break up a state-transition process into a sequence of transitions, so a more flexible initial time must be chosen. Let the initial time be represented by 
 
 
 
  and the corresponding initial state by 
 
 
 
 , and assume that the input 
 
 
 
  and the disturbance 
 
 
 
  are applied at tâ‰¥0. Starting with the above equation by setting 
 
 
 
  and solving for 
 
 
 
 , we get


 
  Once the state-transition equation is determined, the output vector can be expressed as a function of the initial state.
