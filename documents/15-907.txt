   Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase      Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase   Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (, butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase , butanoyl-CoA dehydrogenase , butyryl dehydrogenase , unsaturated acyl-CoA reductase , ethylene reductase , enoyl-coenzyme A reductase , unsaturated acyl coenzyme A reductase , butyryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase , short-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase , short-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase , 3-hydroxyacyl CoA reductase , butanoyl-CoA:(acceptor) 2,3-oxidoreductase , ACADS (gene). ) is an enzyme with system name short-chain acyl-CoA:electron-transfer flavoprotein 2,3-oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   a short-chain acyl-CoA + electron-transfer flavoprotein    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a short-chain trans-2,3-dehydroacyl-CoA + reduced electron-transfer flavoprotein   This enzyime contains FAD as prosthetic group .
