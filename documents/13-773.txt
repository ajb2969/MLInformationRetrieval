Pregaussian class

In probability theory, a pregaussian class or pregaussian set of functions is a set of functions, square integrable with respect to some probability measure, such that there exists a certain Gaussian process, indexed by this set, satisfying the conditions below.
Definition
For a probability space (S, Î£, P), denote by 
 
 
 
  a set of square integrable with respect to P functions 
 
 
 
 , that is



Consider a set 
 
 
 
 . There exists a Gaussian process

 
 , indexed by 
 
 
 
 , with mean 0 and covariance


 
  Such a process exists because the given covariance is positive definite. This covariance defines a semi-inner product as well as a pseudometric on 
 
 
 
  given by



Definition A class 
 
 
 
  is called pregaussian if for each 
 
 
 
  the function 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  is bounded, 
 
 
 
 -uniformly continuous, and prelinear.
Brownian bridge
The 
 
 
 
  process is a generalization of the brownian bridge. Consider 
 
 
 
  with P being the uniform measure. In this case, the 
 
 
 
  process indexed by the indicator functions

 
 , for 
 
 
 
  is in fact the standard brownian bridge B(x). This set of the indicator functions is pregaussian, moreover, it is the Donsker class.
