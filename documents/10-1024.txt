   (+)-abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase      (+)-abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase   In enzymology , a (+)-abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (+)-abscisate + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   8'-hydroxyabscisate + NADP + + H 2 O   The four substrates of this enzyme are (+)- abscisate , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its three products are 8'-hydroxy- abscisate , NADP + , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , to be specific those acting on paired donors, with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor. This enzyme participates in carotenoid  biosynthesis .  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is abscisate,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (8'-hydroxylating) . Other names in common use include   (+)-ABA 8'-hydroxylase and  ABA 8'-hydroxylase.   References      "  Category:EC 1.14.13  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
