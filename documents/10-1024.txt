(+)-abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase




(+)-abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase

In enzymology, a (+)-abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(+)-abscisate + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  8'-hydroxyabscisate + NADP+ + H2O
 

The four substrates of this enzyme are (+)-abscisate, NADPH, H+, and O2, whereas its three products are 8'-hydroxy-abscisate, NADP+, and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, to be specific those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor. This enzyme participates in carotenoid biosynthesis.
Nomenclature
The systematic name of this enzyme class is abscisate,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (8'-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include

(+)-ABA 8'-hydroxylase and
ABA 8'-hydroxylase.
