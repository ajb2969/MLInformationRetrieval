   Signature matrix      Signature matrix   In mathematics , a signature matrix is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are plus or minus 1, that is, any matrix of the form: 1      A  =   (      ±  1     0    ⋯    0    0      0     ±  1     ⋯    0    0      ⋮    ⋮    ⋱    ⋮    ⋮      0    0    ⋯     ±  1     0      0    0    ⋯    0     ±  1      )       A     plus-or-minus  1   0  normal-⋯  0  0    0   plus-or-minus  1   normal-⋯  0  0    normal-⋮  normal-⋮  normal-⋱  normal-⋮  normal-⋮    0  0  normal-⋯   plus-or-minus  1   0    0  0  normal-⋯  0   plus-or-minus  1       A=\begin{pmatrix}\pm 1&0&\cdots&0&0\\
 0&\pm 1&\cdots&0&0\\
 \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\vdots\\
 0&0&\cdots&\pm 1&0\\
 0&0&\cdots&0&\pm 1\end{pmatrix}     Any such matrix is its own inverse , hence is an involutory matrix . It is consequently a square root of the identity matrix . Note however that not all square roots of the identity are signature matrices.  Noting that signature matrices are both symmetric and involutory, they are thus orthogonal . Consequently, any linear transformation corresponding to a signature matrix constitutes an isometry .  Geometrically, signature matrices represent a reflection in each of the axes corresponding to the negated rows or columns.  See also   Metric signature   References  "  Category:Matrices     . ↩
