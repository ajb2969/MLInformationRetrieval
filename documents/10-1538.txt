   N-methyl-L-amino-acid oxidase      N-methyl-L-amino-acid oxidase   In enzymology , a N-methyl-L-amino-acid oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an N-methyl-L-amino acid + H 2 O + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   an L-amino acid + formaldehyde + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are N-methyl-L-amino acid , H 2 O , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are L-amino acid , formaldehyde , and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-methyl-L-amino-acid:oxygen oxidoreductase (demethylating) . Other names in common use include N-methylamino acid oxidase , and demethylase . It has 2 cofactors : FAD , and Flavoprotein .  References       "  Category:EC 1.5.3  Category:Flavin enzymes  Category:Flavoprotein enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
