N-methyl-L-amino-acid oxidase

In enzymology, a N-methyl-L-amino-acid oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

an N-methyl-L-amino acid + H2O + O2

 
  an L-amino acid + formaldehyde + H2O2


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are N-methyl-L-amino acid, H2O, and O2, whereas its 3 products are L-amino acid, formaldehyde, and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-methyl-L-amino-acid:oxygen oxidoreductase (demethylating). Other names in common use include N-methylamino acid oxidase, and demethylase. It has 2 cofactors: FAD, and Flavoprotein.
