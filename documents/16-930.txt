Sakai窶適asahara scheme
The '''Sakai窶適asahara scheme''', also known as the Sakai-Kasahara Key Encryption algorithm ('''SAKKE'''), is an [[Identity based encryption]] system proposed by Ryuichi Sakai and Masao Kasahara in 2003.{{cite journal|last1=Sakai|first1=Ryuichi|l

It is an application of pairings over elliptic curves and finite fields. A security proof for the algorithm was produced in 2005 by Chen and Cheng.1 SAKKE is described in IETF RFC 6508.2
As an specific method for identity-based encryption (IBE), the primary use case is to allow anyone to encrypt a message to a user when the sender only knows the public identity (e.g. email address) of the user. In this way, this scheme removes the requirement for users to share public certificates for the purpose of encryption.
Description of Scheme
The Sakai窶適asahara scheme allows the encryption of a message 
 
 
 
  to an receiver with a specific identity, 
 
 
 
 . Only the entity with the private key, 
 
 
 
 , associated to the identity, 
 
 
 
 , will be capable of decrypting the message.
As part of the scheme, both the sender and receiver must trust a Private Key Generator (PKG), also known as a Key Management Server (KMS). The purpose of the PKG is to create the receiver's private key, 
 
 
 
 , associated to the receiver's identity, 
 
 
 
 . The PKG must securely deliver the identity-specific private key to the receiver, and PKG-specific public parameter, 
 
 
 
 , to all parties. These distribution processes are not considered as part of the definition of this cryptographic scheme.
Preliminaries
The scheme uses two multiplicative groups 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . It is assumed:

The Diffie-Hellman problem is hard in 
 
 
 
 . Meaning that given two members of the group 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , it is hard to find 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .

There is a bilinear map, a Tate-Lichtenbaum pairing, 
 
 
 
  from E to G. This means that for

Frequently, 
 
 
 
  is a supersingular elliptic curve, such as 
 
 
 
  (over a finite field of prime order 
 
 
 
 ). A generator 
 
 
 
  of prime order 
 
 
 
  is chosen in 
 
 
 
 . The group 
 
 
 
  is the image due to the pairing of the group generated by 
 
 
 
  (in the extension field of degree 2 of the finite field of order p).
Two hash functions are also required, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  outputs a positive integer, 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
  outputs 
 
 
 
  bits, where 
 
 
 
  is the length of the message 
 
 
 
 .
Key Generation
The PKG has a master secret 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  which is a point on 
 
 
 
 . The PKG generates the private key, 
 
 
 
 , for the user with identity 
 
 
 
  as follows:








Encryption
To encrypt a non-repeating message 
 
 
 
 , the sender requires receiver's identity, 
 
 
 
  and the public PGK value 
 
 
 
 . The sender performs the following operation.

Create
 
 

The sender generates 
 
 
 
  using 
 
 

Generate the point 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 :
 







Create the masked message:
 







The encrypted output is
 
 


Note that messages may not repeat, as a repeated message to the same identity results in a repeated ciphertext. There is an extension to the protocol should messages potentially repeat.
Decryption
To decrypt a message encrypted to 
 
 
 
 , the receiver requires the private key, 
 
 
 
  from the PKG and the public value 
 
 
 
 . The decryption procedure is as follows:

Compute 
 
 

Receive the encrypted message
 
 
 
 .
Compute:
 







Extract the message:
 







To verify the message, compute 
 
 
 
 , and only accept the message if:
 








Demonstration of Algorithmic Correctness
The following equations demonstrate the correctness of the algorithm:


 
  By the bilinear property of the map:
$$\textstyle w = e([r(id+z)].P,K_U)= e([r(id+z)].P,[\frac{1}{(id+z)}].P) = e(P,P)^{\frac{r(id+z)}{(id+z)}} = g^r$$ As a result:
$$\textstyle  S \oplus H_2(w) = (\mathbb{M} \oplus H_2(g^r)) \oplus H_2(w) = \mathbb{M}$$
Standardisation
There are two standards relating to this protocol:

Initial standardisation of scheme was begun by IEEE in 2006.3
The scheme was standardised by the IETF in 2012 within RFC 6508. The scheme is used as part of the MIKEY-SAKKE protocol, defined in RFC 6509.

Cryptographic Libraries and Implementations
The scheme is part of the MIRACL cryptographic library.
