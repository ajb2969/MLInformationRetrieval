Newsvendor model
The '''newsvendor''' (or '''new
 sboy''' or single-period1 or perishable 2) model is a mathematical model in operations management and applied economics used to determine optimal inventory levels. It is (typically) characterized by fixed prices and uncertain demand for a perishable product. If the inventory level is 
 
 
 
 , each unit of demand above 
 
 
 
  is lost in potential sales. This model is also known as the Newsvendor Problem or Newsboy Problem by analogy with the situation faced by a newspaper vendor who must decide how many copies of the day's paper to stock in the face of uncertain demand and knowing that unsold copies will be worthless at the end of the day.
History
The mathematical problem appears to date from 18883 where Edgeworth used the central limit theorem to determine the optimal cash reserves to satisfy random withdrawals from depositors.4 The modern formulation dates from a 1951 paper in Econometrica by Kenneth Arrow, T. Harris, and Jacob Marshak.5
Profit function
The standard newsvendor profit function is



where 
 
 
 
  is a random variable with probability distribution

 
  representing demand, each unit is sold for price 
 
 
 
  and purchased for price 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the number of units stocked, and 
 
 
 
  is the expectation operator. The solution to the optimal stocking quantity of the newsvendor which maximizes expected profit is:
where 
 
 
 
  denotes the inverse cumulative distribution function of 
 
 
 
 .
Intuitively, this ratio, referred to as the critical fractile, balances the cost of being understocked (a lost sale worth 
 
 
 
 ) and the total costs of being either overstocked or understocked (where the cost of being overstocked is the inventory cost, or 
 
 
 
  so total cost is simply 
 
 
 
 ).
The critical fractile formula is known as Littlewood's rule in the yield management literature.
Numerical Examples
Uniform Distribution
Assume that: retail price is 
 
 
 
  [$/unit] and purchase price is 
 
 
 
  [$/unit]. Furthermore the 
 
 
 
  demand follows a uniform distribution (continuous) between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .



Therefore optimal inventory level is approximately 59 units.
Normal Distribution
Assume that: retail price is 
 
 
 
  [$/unit] and purchase price is 
 
 
 
  [$/unit]. Furthermore the 
 
 
 
  demand follows a normal distribution with a mean, 
 
 
 
 , demand of 50 and a standard deviation, 
 
 
 
 , of 20.



Therefore optimal inventory level is approximately 39 units.
q opt = Mu + sigma x zinv x (2/7) Go to MSExcel. NORMSINV (0.285714) = - 0.56595 Therefore q= 50 + 20 (-0.56595) = 38.69 units
Lognormal Distribution
Assume that: retail price is 
 
 
 
  [$/unit] and purchase price is 
 
 
 
  [$/unit]. Furthermore the 
 
 
 
  demand follows a lognormal distribution with a mean demand of 50, 
 
 
 
 , and a standard deviation, 
 
 
 
 , of 0.2.



Therefore optimal inventory level is approximately 45 units.
Extreme situation
If 
 
 

where the individual parameters are the following:



 
  – fixed cost. This cost always exists when the production of a series is started. [$/production]


 
  – variable cost. This cost type expresses the production cost of one product. [$/product]


 
  – The product quantity in the inventory. The decision of the inventory control policy concerns the product quantity in the inventory after the product decision. This parameter includes the initial inventory as well. If nothing is produced, then this quantity is equal to the initial quantity, i.e. concerning the existing inventory.


 
  – Initial inventory level. We assume that the supplier possesses 
 
 
 
  products in the inventory at the beginning of the demand of the delivery period.


 
  – penalty cost (or back order cost). If there is less raw material in the inventory than needed to satisfy the demands, this is the penalty cost of the unsatisfied orders. [$/product]


 
  – Expected value of the 
 
 
 
  stochastic variable.


 
  – This means the demand from the receiver for the product, which is an optional probability variable. [unit]


 
  – inventory and stock holding cost. [$ / product]

On the basis of the cost function the determination of the optimal inventory level is a minimization problem. So in the long run the amount of cost-optimal end-product can be calculated on the basis of the following relation:6
$$q_\text{opt} = F^{-1}\left( \frac{p-c_v}{p+h}\right)$$
