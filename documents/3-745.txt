   40 Eridani      40 Eridani   40 Eridani is a triple  star system less than 16.5 light years away from Earth , in the constellation Eridanus . It is also known as Omicron 2 Eridani for all collective components. Component A is also known as Keid , from the Arabic word qayd , (egg) shells .  The primary star of the system, 40 Eridani A, is easily visible to the naked eye. The pair 40 Eridani B/C was discovered on January 31, 1783, by William Herschel . 1 , p. 73 It was again observed by Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve in 1825 and by Otto Wilhelm von Struve in 1851. 2 3 In 1910, it was discovered that although component B was a faint star, it was white in color. This meant that it had to be a small star; in fact it was a white dwarf , the first discovered. 4  General information  40 Eridani A , a.k.a. Keid , is a main-sequence  dwarf of spectral type K1. Its two companion stars, 40 Eridani B and 40 Eridani C , are a 9th magnitude white dwarf (spectral type DA4) and an 11th magnitude red dwarf  flare star (spectral type M4.5e) which has the variable star designation DY Eridani. Presumably, while B was a main-sequence star, it was the most massive member of the system, but ejected most of its mass before it became a white dwarf. B and C orbit each other approximately 400 astronomical units from the primary star, A. 5 Their orbit has a semimajor axis of 35 AU (which is the approximate average distance between B and C) and is rather elliptical ( eccentricity 0.410). 6  Although 40 Eridani B is neither the closest white dwarf, nor the brightest in the night sky, it is by far the easiest to observe; it is nearly three magnitudes brighter than Van Maanen's Star (the nearest solitary white dwarf), and unlike the companions of Procyon and Sirius it is not swamped in the glare of a much brighter primary. 7  Distance          Potential for life  The primary component has a metallicity of [Fe/H]=−0.19, i.e. about 65 per cent of the solar metallicity, thus providing a probably sufficient heavy element abundance for the formation of terrestrial planets. However, no planet orbiting a member of 40 Eridani is known so far. The habitable zone of 40 Eridani A, where a planet could exist with liquid water, is near 0.68 (calculated from habitable zone ) AU from A. At this distance a planet would complete a revolution in 223 Earth days (according to the third Kepler's law ) and 40 Eridani A would appear nearly 20% 8 wider than the Sun does on Earth. An observer on a planet in the 40 Eridani A system would see the B/C pair as unusually bright ( magnitudes -8 and -6) white and reddish-orange stars in the night sky. This is not bright enough to diminish the darkness at night, though they would be visible in daylight (assuming an Earth-normal atmosphere). (By comparison, Earth's full moon is magnitude −12.6, and Venus at its brightest is −4.7.) It is extremely unlikely that habitable planets exist around the B star because planets circling 40 Eridani B would probably have been destroyed or sterilized by its evolution into a white dwarf. As for 40 Eridani C, it is prone to flares, which cause large momentary increases in the emission of X-rays as well as visible light. This would be lethal to Earth -type life on planets near the flare star. 9  As seen from the 40 Eridani system, the Sun is a 3.4-magnitude star in Hercules , near the border with Serpens Caput . 10  See also   40 Eridani in fiction   Notes  References  External links   Keid at Jim Kaler's STARS.  40 (Omicron2) Eridani 3 at solstation.com.
