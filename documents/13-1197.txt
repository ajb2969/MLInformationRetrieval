   Föppl–von Kármán equations      Föppl–von Kármán equations   The Föppl–von Kármán equations , named after August Föppl 1 and Theodore von Kármán , 2 are a set of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the large deflections of thin flat plates. 3 With applications ranging from the design of submarine hulls to the mechanical properties of cell wall, 4 the equations are notoriously difficult to solve, and take the following form: 5      (  1  )    1   \displaystyle(1)     where   E   E   E   is the Young's modulus of the plate material (assumed homogeneous and isotropic),   υ   υ   υ   is the Poisson's ratio ,   h   h   h   is the thickness of the plate,   w   w   w   is the out–of–plane deflection of the plate,   P   P   P   is the external normal force per unit area of the plate, is the Cauchy stress tensor , and    α  ,  β     α  β    α,β   are indices that take values of 1 or 2. The 2-dimensional biharmonic operator is defined as 6         Δ  2   w   :=     ∂  2     ∂   x  α     ∂   x  α       [     ∂  2   w     ∂   x  β     ∂   x  β      ]    =      ∂  4   w    ∂   x  1  4     +     ∂  4   w    ∂   x  2  4     +   2      ∂  4   w     ∂   x  1  2     ∂   x  2  2          .       assign     superscript  normal-Δ  2   w        superscript   2        subscript  x  α       subscript  x  α       delimited-[]      superscript   2   w        subscript  x  β       subscript  x  β                   superscript   4   w      superscript   subscript  x  1   4         superscript   4   w      superscript   subscript  x  2   4       2      superscript   4   w        superscript   subscript  x  1   2       superscript   subscript  x  2   2           \Delta^{2}w:=\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x_{\alpha}\partial x_{\alpha}}\left[%
 \frac{\partial^{2}w}{\partial x_{\beta}\partial x_{\beta}}\right]=\frac{%
 \partial^{4}w}{\partial x_{1}^{4}}+\frac{\partial^{4}w}{\partial x_{2}^{4}}+2%
 \frac{\partial^{4}w}{\partial x_{1}^{2}\partial x_{2}^{2}}\,.   Equation (1) above can be derived from kinematic assumptions and the constitutive relations for the plate. Equations (2) are the two equations for the conservation of linear momentum in two dimensions where it is assumed that the out–of–plane stresses ( ) are zero.  Validity of the Föppl–von Kármán equations  While the Föppl–von Kármán equations are of interest from a purely mathematical point of view, the physical validity of these equations is questionable. 7 Ciarlet 8 states: The two-dimensional von Karman equations for plates, originally proposed by von Karman [1910], play a mythical role in applied mathematics. While they have been abundantly, and satisfactorily, studied from the mathematical standpoint, as regards notably various questions of existence, regularity, and bifurcation, of their solutions, their physical soundness has been often seriously questioned. Reasons include the facts that   the theory depends on an approximate geometry which is not clearly defined  a given variation of stress over a cross-section is assumed arbitrarily  a linear constitutive relation is used that does not correspond to a known relation between well defined measures of stress and strain  some components of strain are arbitrarily ignored  there is a confusion between reference and deformed configurations which makes the theory inapplicable to the large deformations for which it was apparently devised.   Conditions under which these equations are actually applicable and will give reasonable results when solved are discussed in Ciarlet. 9 10  Equations in terms of Airy stress function  The three Föppl–von Kármán equations can be reduced to two by introducing the Airy stress function    φ   φ   \varphi   where         σ  11   =      ∂  2   φ    ∂   x  2  2       ,     σ  22   =      ∂  2   φ    ∂   x  1  2       ,    σ  12   =   -      ∂  2   φ     ∂   x  1     ∂   x  2           .     formulae-sequence     subscript  σ  11       superscript   2   φ      superscript   subscript  x  2   2       formulae-sequence     subscript  σ  22       superscript   2   φ      superscript   subscript  x  1   2         subscript  σ  12         superscript   2   φ        subscript  x  1       subscript  x  2           \sigma_{11}=\frac{\partial^{2}\varphi}{\partial x_{2}^{2}}~{},~{}~{}\sigma_{22%

Then the above equations become 11          E   h  3     12   (   1  -   ν  2    )      Δ  2   w   -   h   (        ∂  2   φ    ∂   x  2  2        ∂  2   w    ∂   x  1  2      +      ∂  2   φ    ∂   x  1  2        ∂  2   w    ∂   x  2  2       -   2     ∂  2   φ     ∂    x  1      ∂   x  2         ∂  2   w     ∂    x  1      ∂   x  2        )     =  P              E   superscript  h  3      12    1   superscript  ν  2       superscript  normal-Δ  2   w     h            superscript   2   φ      superscript   subscript  x  2   2         superscript   2   w      superscript   subscript  x  1   2            superscript   2   φ      superscript   subscript  x  1   2         superscript   2   w      superscript   subscript  x  2   2         2      superscript   2   φ        subscript  x  1       subscript  x  2          superscript   2   w        subscript  x  1       subscript  x  2          P    \frac{Eh^{3}}{12(1-\nu^{2})}\Delta^{2}w-h\left(\frac{\partial^{2}\varphi}{%

Pure bending  For the pure bending of thin plates the equation of equilibrium is     D    Δ  2    w   =  P        D   superscript  normal-Δ  2   w   P    D\Delta^{2}\ w=P   , where      D  :=    E   h  3     12   (   1  -   ν  2    )        assign  D      E   superscript  h  3      12    1   superscript  ν  2        D:=\frac{Eh^{3}}{12(1-\nu^{2})}   is called flexural or cylindrical rigidity of the plate. 12  Kinematic assumptions (Kirchhoff hypothesis)  In the derivation of the Föppl–von Kármán equations the main kinematic assumption (also known as the Kirchhoff hypothesis ) is that surface normals to the plane of the plate remain perpendicular to the plate after deformation. It is also assumed that the in-plane (membrane) displacements and the change in thickness of the plate are negligible. These assumptions imply that the displacement field   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   in the plate can be expressed as         u  1    (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,   x  3   )    =   -     x  3       ∂  w    ∂   x  1         ,      u  2    (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,   x  3   )    =   -     x  3       ∂  w    ∂   x  2         ,     u  3    (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,   x  3   )    =   w   (   x  1   ,   x  2   )         formulae-sequence       subscript  u  1     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3          subscript  x  3       w      subscript  x  1         formulae-sequence       subscript  u  2     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3          subscript  x  3       w      subscript  x  2             subscript  u  3     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3       w    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2         u_{1}(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=-x_{3}\,\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_{1}}~{},~{}~{}u_%

 }(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=w(x_{1},x_{2})   This form of the displacement field implicitly assumes that the amount of rotation of the plate is small.  Strain-displacement relations (von Kármán strains)  The components of the three-dimensional Lagrangian Green strain tensor are defined as        E   i  j    :=    1  2    [     ∂   u  i     ∂   x  j     +    ∂   u  j     ∂   x  i     +      ∂   u  k     ∂   x  i        ∂   u  k     ∂   x  j       ]     .     assign   subscript  E    i  j        1  2    delimited-[]         subscript  u  i       subscript  x  j          subscript  u  j       subscript  x  i            subscript  u  k       subscript  x  i          subscript  u  k       subscript  x  j           E_{ij}:=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}+\frac{\partial u%
 _{j}}{\partial x_{i}}+\frac{\partial u_{k}}{\partial x_{i}}\,\frac{\partial u_%
 {k}}{\partial x_{j}}\right]\,.   Substitution of the expressions for the displacement field into the above gives      E  11     subscript  E  11    \displaystyle E_{11}   For small strains but moderate rotations , the higher order terms that cannot be neglected are          (    ∂  w    ∂   x  1     )   2    ,     (    ∂  w    ∂   x  2     )   2    ,      ∂  w    ∂   x  1         ∂  w    ∂   x  2        .      superscript      w      subscript  x  1     2    superscript      w      subscript  x  2     2         w      subscript  x  1         w      subscript  x  2        \left(\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_{1}}\right)^{2}~{},~{}~{}\left(\frac{%
 \partial w}{\partial x_{2}}\right)^{2}~{},~{}~{}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_{%
 1}}\,\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_{2}}\,.   Neglecting all other higher order terms, and enforcing the requirement that the plate does not change its thickness, the strain tensor components reduce to the von Kármán strains      E  11     subscript  E  11    \displaystyle E_{11}     Stress-strain relations  If we assume that the Cauchy stress tensor components are linearly related to the von Kármán strains by Hooke's law , the plate is isotropic and homogeneous, and that the plate in under a plane stress condition, 13 we have = = = 0 and       [      σ  11        σ  22        σ  12      ]   =    E   (   1  -   ν  2    )     [     1    ν    0      ν    1    0      0    0     1  -  ν      ]    [      E  11        E  22        E  12      ]           subscript  σ  11      subscript  σ  22      subscript  σ  12        continued-fraction  E    1   superscript  ν  2       1  ν  0    ν  1  0    0  0    1  ν        subscript  E  11      subscript  E  22      subscript  E  12        \begin{bmatrix}\sigma_{11}\\
 \sigma_{22}\\
 \sigma_{12}\end{bmatrix}=\cfrac{E}{(1-\nu^{2})}\begin{bmatrix}1&\nu&0\\
 \nu&1&0\\
 0&0&1-\nu\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}E_{11}\\
 E_{22}\\
 E_{12}\end{bmatrix}   Expanding the terms, the three non-zero stresses are      σ  11     subscript  σ  11    \displaystyle\sigma_{11}     Stress resultants  The stress resultants in the plate are defined as         N   α  β    :=    ∫   -   h  /  2     h  /  2       σ   α  β     d    x  3       ,    M   α  β    :=    ∫   -   h  /  2     h  /  2       x  3      σ   α  β     d    x  3        .     formulae-sequence   assign   subscript  N    α  β      superscript   subscript       h  2       h  2       subscript  σ    α  β    d   subscript  x  3       assign   subscript  M    α  β      superscript   subscript       h  2       h  2       subscript  x  3    subscript  σ    α  β    d   subscript  x  3        N_{\alpha\beta}:=\int_{-h/2}^{h/2}\sigma_{\alpha\beta}\,dx_{3}~{},~{}~{}M_{%
 \alpha\beta}:=\int_{-h/2}^{h/2}x_{3}\,\sigma_{\alpha\beta}\,dx_{3}\,.   Therefore,      N  11     subscript  N  11    \displaystyle N_{11}   and      M  11     subscript  M  11    \displaystyle M_{11}   Solutions are easier to find when the governing equations are expressed in terms of stress resultants rather than the in-plane stresses.  Föppl–von_Kármán equations in terms of stress resultants  The Föppl–von_Kármán equations are typically derived with an energy approach by considering variations of internal energy and the work done by external forces. A similar approach can be used to write these equations in terms of stress resultants. The resulting governing equations are           ∂  2    M  11     ∂   x  1  2      +      ∂  2    M  22     ∂   x  2  2      +   2      ∂  2    M  12      ∂   x  1     ∂   x  2        +     ∂   ∂   x  1       (      N  11       ∂  w    ∂   x  1       +     N  12       ∂  w    ∂   x  2        )    +     ∂   ∂   x  2       (      N  12       ∂  w    ∂   x  1       +     N  22       ∂  w    ∂   x  2        )     =  P            superscript   2    subscript  M  11       superscript   subscript  x  1   2         superscript   2    subscript  M  22       superscript   subscript  x  2   2       2      superscript   2    subscript  M  12         subscript  x  1       subscript  x  2               subscript  x  1          subscript  N  11       w      subscript  x  1         subscript  N  12       w      subscript  x  2                subscript  x  2          subscript  N  12       w      subscript  x  1         subscript  N  22       w      subscript  x  2         P    \displaystyle\frac{\partial^{2}M_{11}}{\partial x_{1}^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}M%
