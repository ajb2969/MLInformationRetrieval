   Mannuronate reductase      Mannuronate reductase   In enzymology , a mannuronate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-mannonate + NAD(P)+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-mannuronate + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are D-mannonate , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are D-mannuronate , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-mannonate:NAD(P)+ 6-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include mannonate dehydrogenase , mannonate (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , (phosphate))dehydrogenase , mannonate dehydrogenase , mannuronate reductase , mannonate dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+) , D-mannonate:nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate , and oxidoreductase (D-mannuronate-forming)) .
