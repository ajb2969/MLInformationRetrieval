Schnorr group

A Schnorr group, proposed by Claus P. Schnorr, is a large prime-order subgroup of 
 
 
 
 , the multiplicative group of integers modulo 
 
 
 for some prime

 
 . To generate such a group, generate 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  such that



with 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  prime. Then choose any 
 
 
 
  in the range 
 
 
 
  until you find one such that


 
 .
This value



is a generator of a subgroup of 
 
 
 
 
  of order 
 
 
 
 .
Schnorr groups are useful in discrete log based cryptosystems including Schnorr signatures and DSA. In such applications, typically 
 
 
 
  is chosen to be large enough to resist index-calculus and related methods of solving the discrete-log problem (perhaps 1024 to 3072 bits), while 
 
 
 
  is large enough to resist the birthday attack on discrete log problems, which works in any group (perhaps 160 to 256 bits). Because the Schnorr group is of prime order, it has no non-trivial proper subgroups, thwarting  confinement attacks due to small subgroups. Implementations of protocols that use Schnorr groups must verify where appropriate that integers supplied by other parties are in fact members of the Schnorr group; 
 
 
 
  is a member of the group if 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Any member of the group except the element 
 
 
 
  is also a generator of the group.
