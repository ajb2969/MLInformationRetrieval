   Invariant measure      Invariant measure   In mathematics , an invariant measure is a measure that is preserved by some function . Ergodic theory is the study of invariant measures in dynamical systems . The Krylov–Bogolyubov theorem proves the existence of invariant measures under certain conditions on the function and space under consideration.  Definition  Let ( X , Σ) be a measurable space and let f be a measurable function from X to itself. A measure μ on ( X , Σ) is said to be invariant under  f if, for every measurable set A in Σ,        μ   (    f   -  1     (  A  )    )    =   μ   (  A  )     .        μ     superscript  f    1    A      μ  A     \mu\left(f^{-1}(A)\right)=\mu(A).     In terms of the push forward , this states that f ∗ ( μ ) = μ .  The collection of measures (usually probability measures ) on X that are invariant under f is sometimes denoted M f ( X ). The collection of ergodic measures , E f ( X ), is a subset of M f ( X ). Moreover, any convex combination of two invariant measures is also invariant, so M f ( X ) is a convex set ; E f ( X ) consists precisely of the extreme points of M f ( X ).  In the case of a dynamical system ( X , T , φ ), where ( X , Σ) is a measurable space as before, T is a monoid and φ : T × X → X is the flow map, a measure μ on ( X , Σ) is said to be an invariant measure if it is an invariant measure for each map φ t : X → X . Explicitly, μ is invariant if and only if         μ   (    φ  t   -  1     (  A  )    )    =   μ   (  A  )        ∀  t   ∈  T   ,   A  ∈  Σ     .     formulae-sequence      μ     superscript   subscript  φ  t     1    A      μ  A     formulae-sequence     for-all  t   T     A  normal-Σ      \mu\left(\varphi_{t}^{-1}(A)\right)=\mu(A)\qquad\forall t\in T,A\in\Sigma.     Put another way, μ is an invariant measure for a sequence of random variables ( Z t ) t ≥0 (perhaps a Markov chain or the solution to a stochastic differential equation ) if, whenever the initial condition Z 0 is distributed according to μ , so is Z t for any later time t .  Examples       Consider the real line  R with its usual Borel σ-algebra ; fix a ∈ R and consider the translation map T a : R → R given by:            T  a    (  x  )    =   x  +  a    .         subscript  T  a   x     x  a     T_{a}(x)=x+a.         Then one-dimensional Lebesgue measure  λ is an invariant measure for T a .    More generally, on n -dimensional Euclidean space  R n with its usual Borel σ-algebra, n -dimensional Lebesgue measure λ n is an invariant measure for any isometry of Euclidean space, i.e. a map T : R n → R n that can be written as          T   (  x  )    =    A  x   +  b         T  x       A  x   b     T(x)=Ax+b         for some n × n  orthogonal matrix  A ∈ O( n ) and a vector b ∈ R n .    The invariant measure in the first example is unique up to trivial renormalization with a constant factor. This does not have to be necessarily the case: Consider a set consisting of just two points    𝐒  =   {  A  ,  B  }       𝐒   A  B     \boldsymbol{\rm S}=\{A,B\}   and the identity map    T  =  Id      T  Id    T={\rm Id}   which leaves each point fixed. Then any probability measure    μ  :   𝐒  →  𝐑      normal-:  μ   normal-→  𝐒  𝐑     \mu:\boldsymbol{\rm S}\rightarrow\boldsymbol{\rm R}   is invariant. Note that S trivially has a decomposition into T -invariant components {A} and {B} .    The measure of circular angles in degrees or radians is invariant under rotation . Similarly, the measure of hyperbolic angle is invariant under squeeze mapping .    Area measure in the Euclidean plane is invariant under 2 × 2 real matrices with determinant 1 , also known as the special linear group  SL(2,R) .    Every locally compact group has a Haar measure that is invariant under the group action.
