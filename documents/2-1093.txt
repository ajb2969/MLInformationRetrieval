   Repdigit      Repdigit   In recreational mathematics , a repdigit or sometimes monodigit 1 is a natural number composed of repeated instances of the same digit in a positional number system (often implicitly decimal ). The word repdigit is a portmanteau , formed from rep eated digit .  Examples are 11 , 666 , 4444 , and 999999 . All repdigits are palindromic numbers and are multiples of repunits . One of the most famous repdigits is 666 , referred to in Christian  Eschatology as the number of the beast . Other well-known repdigits include the repunit primes and in particular the Mersenne primes (when represented in binary).  Repdigits are the representation in base    B   B   B   of the number    x     B  y   -  1    B  -  1        x       superscript  B  y   1     B  1      x\frac{B^{y}-1}{B-1}   where    7  ×     10  2   -  1    10  -  1        7       superscript  10  2   1     10  1      7\times\frac{10^{2}-1}{10-1}   is the number of repetitions. For example, the repdigit 77 in base 10 is $7\times\frac{10^2-1}{10-1}$ .  See also   Feynman point  Repunit   References     "  Category:Base-dependent integer sequences     ↩
