Repdigit

In recreational mathematics, a repdigit or sometimes monodigit1 is a natural number composed of repeated instances of the same digit in a positional number system (often implicitly decimal). The word repdigit is a portmanteau, formed from repeated digit.
Examples are 11, 666, 4444, and 999999. All repdigits are palindromic numbers and are multiples of repunits. One of the most famous repdigits is 666, referred to in Christian Eschatology as the number of the beast. Other well-known repdigits include the repunit primes and in particular the Mersenne primes (when represented in binary).
Repdigits are the representation in base

 
  of the number 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the number of repetitions. For example, the repdigit 77 in base 10 is $7\times\frac{10^2-1}{10-1}$.
