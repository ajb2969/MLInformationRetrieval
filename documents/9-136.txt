Doob's martingale inequality

In mathematics, Doob's martingale inequality is a result in the study of stochastic processes. It gives a bound on the probability that a stochastic process exceeds any given value over a given interval of time. As the name suggests, the result is usually given in the case that the process is a non-negative martingale, but the result is also valid for non-negative submartingales.
The inequality is due to the American mathematician Joseph L. Doob.
Statement of the inequality
Let X be a submartingale taking non-negative real values, either in discrete or continuous time. That is, for all times s and t with s  X_{s}\leq\mathbf{E} \left[ X_{t} \big| \mathcal{F}_{s} \right].
(For a continuous-time submartingale, assume further that the process is càdlàg.) Then, for any constant C > 0 and p ≥ 1,



In the above, as is conventional, P denotes the probability measure on the sample space Ω of the stochastic process



and E denotes the expected value with respect to the probability measure P, i.e. the integral



in the sense of Lebesgue integration. 
 
 
 
  denotes the σ-algebra generated by all the random variables Xi with i ≤ s; the collection of such σ-algebras forms a filtration of the probability space.
Further inequalities
There are further (sub)martingale inequalities also due to Doob. With the same assumptions on X as above, let



and for p ≥ 1 let



In this notation, Doob's inequality as stated above reads



The following inequalities also hold: for p = 1,



and, for p > 1,



Related inequalities
Doob's inequality for discrete-time martingales implies Kolmogorov's inequality: if X1, X2, ... is a sequence of real-valued independent random variables, each with mean zero, it is clear that



so Mn = X1 + ... + Xn is a martingale. Note that Jensen's inequality implies that |Mn| is a nonnegative submartingale if Mn is a martingale. Hence, taking p = 2 in Doob's martingale inequality,



which is precisely the statement of Kolmogorov's inequality.
Application: Brownian motion
Let B denote canonical one-dimensional Brownian motion. Then



The proof is just as follows: since the exponential function is monotonically increasing, for any non-negative λ,



By Doob's inequality, and since the exponential of Brownian motion is a positive submartingale,



Since the left-hand side does not depend on λ, choose λ to minimize the right-hand side: λ = C/T gives the desired inequality.
