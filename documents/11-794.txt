Ureidoglycolate hydrolase




Ureidoglycolate hydrolase

In enzymology, an ureidoglycolate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-ureidoglycolate + H2O 
 
 
 
  glyoxylate + 2 NH3 + CO2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-ureidoglycolate and H2O, whereas its 3 products are glyoxylate, NH3, and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase (decarboxylating). This enzyme participates in purine metabolism.
