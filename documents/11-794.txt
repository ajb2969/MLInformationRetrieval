   Ureidoglycolate hydrolase      Ureidoglycolate hydrolase   In enzymology , an ureidoglycolate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-ureidoglycolate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glyoxylate + 2 NH 3 + CO 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-ureidoglycolate and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are glyoxylate , NH 3 , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase (decarboxylating) . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
