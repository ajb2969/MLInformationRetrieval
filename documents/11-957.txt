   N-hydroxyarylamine O-acetyltransferase      N-hydroxyarylamine O-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a N-hydroxyarylamine O-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + an N-hydroxyarylamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + an N-acetoxyarylamine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and N-hydroxyarylamine , whereas its two products are CoA and N-acetoxyarylamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:N-hydroxyarylamine O-acetyltransferase . Other names in common use include arylhydroxamate N,O-acetyltransferase , arylamine N-acetyltransferase , and N-hydroxy-2-aminofluorene-O-acetyltransferase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
