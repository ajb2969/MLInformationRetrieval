   Continuous dual Hahn polynomials      Continuous dual Hahn polynomials   In mathematics, the continuous dual Hahn polynomials are a family of orthogonal polynomials in the Askey scheme of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials. They are defined in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions by         S  n    (   x  2   ;  a  ,  b  ,  c  )    =    F  2    3     (   -  n   ,   a  +   i  x    ,   a  -   i  x    ;   a  +  b   ,   a  +  c   ;  1  )     .         subscript  S  n     superscript  x  2   a  b  c       subscript   subscript  F  2   3      n     a    i  x      a    i  x      a  b     a  c   1      S_{n}(x^{2};a,b,c)={}_{3}F_{2}(-n,a+ix,a-ix;a+b,a+c;1).   give a detailed list of their properties.  Closely related polynomials include the dual Hahn polynomials  R n ( x ;γ,δ, N ), the continuous Hahn polynomials  p n ( x , a , b ,    a  ¯     normal-¯  a    \overline{a}   ,    b  ¯     normal-¯  b    \overline{b}   ), and the Hahn polynomials . These polynomials all have q -analogs with an extra parameter q , such as the q-Hahn polynomials  Q n ( x ;α,β, N ; q ), and so on.
