Tschirnhausen cubic

 In geometry, the Tschirnhausen cubic, or Tschirnhaus' cubic is a plane curve defined by the polar equation



History
The curve was studied by von Tschirnhaus, de L'Hôpital, and Catalan. It was given the name Tschirnhausen cubic in a 1900 paper by R C Archibald, though it is sometimes known as de L'Hôpital's cubic or the trisectrix of Catalan.
Other equations
Put 
 
 
 
 . Then applying triple-angle formulas gives

















giving a parametric form for the curve. The parameter t can be eliminated easily giving the Cartesian equation


 
 .
If the curve is translated horizontally by 8a then the equations become





 
  or


 
 . This gives an alternate polar form of
