   Persymmetric matrix      Persymmetric matrix   In mathematics , persymmetric matrix may refer to:   a square matrix which is symmetric in the northeast-to-southwest diagonal; or  a square matrix such that the values on each line perpendicular to the main diagonal are the same for a given line.   The first definition is the most common in the recent literature. The designation " Hankel matrix " is often used for matrices satisfying the property in the second definition.  Definition 1  Let A = ( a i ⁣ j ) be an n × n matrix. The first definition of persymmetric requires that       a   i  j    =   a     n  -  j   +  1   ,    n  -  i   +  1          subscript  a    i  j     subscript  a       n  j   1       n  i   1       a_{ij}=a_{n-j+1,n-i+1}   for all i , j . 1 For example, 5-by-5 persymmetric matrices are of the form       A  =   [      a  11      a  12      a  13      a  14      a  15        a  21      a  22      a  23      a  24      a  14        a  31      a  32      a  33      a  23      a  13        a  41      a  42      a  32      a  22      a  12        a  51      a  41      a  31      a  21      a  11      ]    .      A     subscript  a  11    subscript  a  12    subscript  a  13    subscript  a  14    subscript  a  15      subscript  a  21    subscript  a  22    subscript  a  23    subscript  a  24    subscript  a  14      subscript  a  31    subscript  a  32    subscript  a  33    subscript  a  23    subscript  a  13      subscript  a  41    subscript  a  42    subscript  a  32    subscript  a  22    subscript  a  12      subscript  a  51    subscript  a  41    subscript  a  31    subscript  a  21    subscript  a  11       A=\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}&a_{14}&a_{15}\\
 a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}&a_{24}&a_{14}\\
 a_{31}&a_{32}&a_{33}&a_{23}&a_{13}\\
 a_{41}&a_{42}&a_{32}&a_{22}&a_{12}\\
 a_{51}&a_{41}&a_{31}&a_{21}&a_{11}\end{bmatrix}.     This can be equivalently expressed as AJ = JA T where J is the exchange matrix .  A symmetric matrix is a matrix whose values are symmetric in the northwest-to-southeast diagonal. If a symmetric matrix is rotated by 90°, it becomes a persymmetric matrix. Symmetric persymmetric matrices are sometimes called bisymmetric matrices .  Definition 2  The second definition is due to Thomas Muir . 2 It says that the square matrix A = ( a ij ) is persymmetric if a ij depends only on i + j . Persymmetric matrices in this sense, or Hankel matrices as they are often called, are of the form       A  =   [      r  1      r  2      r  3     ⋯     r  n        r  2      r  3      r  4     ⋯     r   n  +  1         r  3      r  4      r  5     ⋯     r   n  +  2        ⋮    ⋮    ⋮    ⋱    ⋮       r  n      r   n  +  1       r   n  +  2      ⋯     r    2  n   -  1       ]    .      A     subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2    subscript  r  3   normal-⋯   subscript  r  n      subscript  r  2    subscript  r  3    subscript  r  4   normal-⋯   subscript  r    n  1       subscript  r  3    subscript  r  4    subscript  r  5   normal-⋯   subscript  r    n  2      normal-⋮  normal-⋮  normal-⋮  normal-⋱  normal-⋮     subscript  r  n    subscript  r    n  1     subscript  r    n  2    normal-⋯   subscript  r      2  n   1        A=\begin{bmatrix}r_{1}&r_{2}&r_{3}&\cdots&r_{n}\\
 r_{2}&r_{3}&r_{4}&\cdots&r_{n+1}\\
 r_{3}&r_{4}&r_{5}&\cdots&r_{n+2}\\
 \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
 r_{n}&r_{n+1}&r_{n+2}&\cdots&r_{2n-1}\end{bmatrix}.   A persymmetric determinant is the determinant of a persymmetric matrix. 3  A matrix for which the values on each line parallel to the main diagonal are constant, is called a Toeplitz matrix .
