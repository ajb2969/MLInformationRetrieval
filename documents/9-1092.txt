Persymmetric matrix

In mathematics, persymmetric matrix may refer to:

a square matrix which is symmetric in the northeast-to-southwest diagonal; or
a square matrix such that the values on each line perpendicular to the main diagonal are the same for a given line.

The first definition is the most common in the recent literature. The designation "Hankel matrix" is often used for matrices satisfying the property in the second definition.
Definition 1
Let A = (ai⁣j) be an n × n matrix. The first definition of persymmetric requires that


 
  for all i, j.1 For example, 5-by-5 persymmetric matrices are of the form



This can be equivalently expressed as AJ = JAT where J is the exchange matrix.
A symmetric matrix is a matrix whose values are symmetric in the northwest-to-southeast diagonal. If a symmetric matrix is rotated by 90°, it becomes a persymmetric matrix. Symmetric persymmetric matrices are sometimes called bisymmetric matrices.
Definition 2
The second definition is due to Thomas Muir.2 It says that the square matrix A = (aij) is persymmetric if aij depends only on i + j. Persymmetric matrices in this sense, or Hankel matrices as they are often called, are of the form


 
  A persymmetric determinant is the determinant of a persymmetric matrix.3
A matrix for which the values on each line parallel to the main diagonal are constant, is called a Toeplitz matrix.
