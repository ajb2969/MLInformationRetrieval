   Graph coloring game      Graph coloring game   The graph coloring game is a mathematical game related to graph theory . Coloring game problems arose as game-theoretic versions of well-known graph coloring problems. In a coloring game, two players are using a given set of colors to construct a coloring of a graph , following specific rules depending on the game we consider. One player tries to complete successfully the coloring of the graph, when the other one tries to prevent him to achieve it.  Vertex coloring game  The vertex coloring game was introduced in 1981 by Brahms 1 and rediscovered ten years after by Bodlaender. 2 Its rules are as follows:   Alice and Bob are coloring the vertices of a graph G with a set k of colors.  Alice and Bob are taking turns, coloring properly a uncolored vertex (in the standard version, Alice begins).  If a vertex v is impossible to color properly (for any color, v has a neighbor colored with it), then Bob wins.  If the graph is completely colored, then Alice wins.   The game chromatic number of a graph   G   G   G   , denoted by     χ  g    (  G  )        subscript  χ  g   G    \chi_{g}(G)   , is the minimum number of colors needed for Alice to win the vertex coloring game on   G   G   G   . Trivially, for every graph   G   G   G   , we have     χ   (  G  )    ≤    χ  g    (  G  )    ≤    Δ   (  G  )    +  1           χ  G      subscript  χ  g   G            normal-Δ  G   1      \chi(G)\leq\chi_{g}(G)\leq\Delta(G)+1   , where    χ   (  G  )       χ  G    \chi(G)   is the chromatic number of   G   G   G   and    Δ   (  G  )       normal-Δ  G    \Delta(G)   its maximum degree . 3  Relation with other notions  Acyclic coloring. Every graph   G   G   G   with acyclic chromatic number    k   k   k   has      χ  g    (  G  )    ≤   k   (   k  +  1   )           subscript  χ  g   G     k    k  1      \chi_{g}(G)\leq k(k+1)   . 4  Marking game. For every graph   G   G   G   ,      χ  g    (  G  )    ≤   c  o   l  g    (  G  )           subscript  χ  g   G     c  o   subscript  l  g   G     \chi_{g}(G)\leq col_{g}(G)   , where    c  o   l  g    (  G  )       c  o   subscript  l  g   G    col_{g}(G)   is the game coloring number of   G   G   G   . Almost every known upper bound for the game chromatic number of graphs are obtained from bounds on the game coloring number.  Cycle-restrictions on edges. If every edge of a graph   G   G   G   belongs to at most   c   c   c   cycles, then      χ  g    (  G  )    ≤   4  +  c          subscript  χ  g   G     4  c     \chi_{g}(G)\leq 4+c   . 5  Graph Classes  For a class   𝒞   𝒞   {\mathcal{C}}   of graphs, we denote by     χ  g    (  𝒞  )        subscript  χ  g   𝒞    \chi_{g}({\mathcal{C}})   the smallest integer   k   k   k   such that every graph   G   G   G   of   𝒞   𝒞   {\mathcal{C}}   has      χ  g    (  G  )    ≤  k         subscript  χ  g   G   k    \chi_{g}(G)\leq k   . In other words,     χ  g    (  𝒞  )        subscript  χ  g   𝒞    \chi_{g}({\mathcal{C}})   is the exact upper bound for the game chromatic number of graphs in this class. This value is known for several standard graph classes, and bounded for some others:   Forests       χ  g    (  ℱ  )    =  4         subscript  χ  g   ℱ   4    \chi_{g}({\mathcal{F}})=4   . 6 Simple criteria are known to determine the game chromatic number of a forest without vertex of degree 3. 7 It seems difficult to determine the game chromatic number of forests with vertices of degree 3, even for forests with maximum degree 3.

The game chromatic number of the cartesian product    G  □  H      G  normal-□  H    G\square H   is not bounded by a function of     χ  g    (  G  )        subscript  χ  g   G    \chi_{g}(G)   and     χ  g    (  H  )        subscript  χ  g   H    \chi_{g}(H)   . In particular, the game chromatic number of any complete bipartite graph    K   n  ,  n      subscript  K   n  n     K_{n,n}   is equal to 3, but there is no upper bound for     χ  g    (    K   n  ,  n    □   K   m  ,  m     )        subscript  χ  g      subscript  K   n  n    normal-□   subscript  K   m  m       \chi_{g}(K_{n,n}\square K_{m,m})   for arbitrary    n  ,  m     n  m    n,m   . 16         χ  g    (    K  2   □   P  1    )    =  2         subscript  χ  g      subscript  K  2   normal-□   subscript  P  1     2    \chi_{g}(K_{2}\square P_{1})=2   ,       χ  g    (    K  2   □   P  k    )    =  3         subscript  χ  g      subscript  K  2   normal-□   subscript  P  k     3    \chi_{g}(K_{2}\square P_{k})=3   if    k  ∈   {  2  ,  3  }       k   2  3     k\in\{2,3\}   , and      χ  g    (    K  2   □   P  k    )    =  4         subscript  χ  g      subscript  K  2   normal-□   subscript  P  k     4    \chi_{g}(K_{2}\square P_{k})=4   if    k  ≥  4      k  4    k\geq 4   . 17  For any    k  ≥  3      k  3    k\geq 3   ,      χ  g    (    K  2   □   C  k    )    =  4         subscript  χ  g      subscript  K  2   normal-□   subscript  C  k     4    \chi_{g}(K_{2}\square C_{k})=4   . 18  For any   k   k   k   ,      χ  g    (    K  2   □   K  k    )    =   k  +  1          subscript  χ  g      subscript  K  2   normal-□   subscript  K  k       k  1     \chi_{g}(K_{2}\square K_{k})=k+1   . 19  Trees       χ  g    (    T  1   □   T  2    )    ≤  12         subscript  χ  g      subscript  T  1   normal-□   subscript  T  2     12    \chi_{g}(T_{1}\square T_{2})\leq 12   .

Edge coloring game  The edge coloring game , introduced by Lam, Shiu and Zu, 23 is similar to the vertex coloring game, except Alice and Bob construct a proper edge coloring instead of a proper vertex coloring. Its rules are as follows:   Alice and Bob are coloring the edges a graph G with a set k of colors.  Alice and Bob are taking turns, coloring properly a uncolored edge (in the standard version, Alice begins).  If an edge e is impossible to color properly (for any color, e is adjacent to an edge colored with it), then Bob wins.  If the graph is completely edge-colored, then Alice wins.   Although this game can be considered as a particular case of the vertex coloring game on line graphs , it is mainly considered in the scientific literature as a distinct game. The game chromatic index of a graph   G   G   G   , denoted by     χ  g  ′    (  G  )        subscript   superscript  χ  normal-′   g   G    \chi^{\prime}_{g}(G)   , is the minimum number of colors needed for Alice to win this game on   G   G   G   .  General case  For every graph G ,      χ  ′    (  G  )    ≤    χ  g  ′    (  G  )    ≤    2  Δ   (  G  )    -  1            superscript  χ  normal-′   G      subscript   superscript  χ  normal-′   g   G            2  normal-Δ  G   1      \chi^{\prime}(G)\leq\chi^{\prime}_{g}(G)\leq 2\Delta(G)-1   . There are graphs reaching these bounds but all the graphs we know reaching this upper bound have small maximum degree. 24 There exists graphs with      χ  g  ′    (  G  )    >   1.008  Δ   (  G  )           subscript   superscript  χ  normal-′   g   G     1.008  normal-Δ  G     \chi^{\prime}_{g}(G)>1.008\Delta(G)   for arbitrary large values of    Δ   (  G  )       normal-Δ  G    \Delta(G)   . 25  Conjecture.  There is an    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   such that, for any arbitrary graph   G   G   G   , we have      χ  g  ′    (  G  )    ≤    (   2  -  ϵ   )   Δ   (  G  )           subscript   superscript  χ  normal-′   g   G       2  ϵ   normal-Δ  G     \chi^{\prime}_{g}(G)\leq(2-\epsilon)\Delta(G)   .

Its rules are as follows:   Alice and Bob are coloring the incidences of a graph G with a set k of colors.  Alice and Bob are taking turns, coloring properly a uncolored incidence (in the standard version, Alice begins).  If an incidence  i is impossible to color properly (for any color, i is adjacent to an incident colored with it), then Bob wins.  If all the incidences are properly colored, then Alice wins.
