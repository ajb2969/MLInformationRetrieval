Graph coloring game

The graph coloring game is a mathematical game related to graph theory. Coloring game problems arose as game-theoretic versions of well-known graph coloring problems. In a coloring game, two players are using a given set of colors to construct a coloring of a graph, following specific rules depending on the game we consider. One player tries to complete successfully the coloring of the graph, when the other one tries to prevent him to achieve it.
Vertex coloring game
The vertex coloring game was introduced in 1981 by Brahms1 and rediscovered ten years after by Bodlaender.2 Its rules are as follows:

Alice and Bob are coloring the vertices of a graph G with a set k of colors.
Alice and Bob are taking turns, coloring properly a uncolored vertex (in the standard version, Alice begins).
If a vertex v is impossible to color properly (for any color, v has a neighbor colored with it), then Bob wins.
If the graph is completely colored, then Alice wins.

The game chromatic number of a graph 
 
 
 
 , denoted by 
 
 
 
 , is the minimum number of colors needed for Alice to win the vertex coloring game on 
 
 
 
 . Trivially, for every graph 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the chromatic number of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  its maximum degree.3

Forests

Open problems
These questions are still open to this date.
Edge coloring game
The edge coloring game, introduced by Lam, Shiu and Zu,23 is similar to the vertex coloring game, except Alice and Bob construct a proper edge coloring instead of a proper vertex coloring. Its rules are as follows:

Alice and Bob are coloring the edges a graph G with a set k of colors.
Alice and Bob are taking turns, coloring properly a uncolored edge (in the standard version, Alice begins).
If an edge e is impossible to color properly (for any color, e is adjacent to an edge colored with it), then Bob wins.
If the graph is completely edge-colored, then Alice wins.

Although this game can be considered as a particular case of the vertex coloring game on line graphs, it is mainly considered in the scientific literature as a distinct game. The game chromatic index of a graph 
 
 
 
 , denoted by 
 
 
 
 , is the minimum number of colors needed for Alice to win this game on 
 
 
 
 .
General case
For every graph G, 
 
 
 
 . There are graphs reaching these bounds but all the graphs we know reaching this upper bound have small maximum degree.24 There exists graphs with 
 
 
 
  for arbitrary large values of 
 
 
 
 .25
Conjecture. There is an 
 
 
 
  such that, for any arbitrary graph 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
 .
 This conjecture is true when 
 
 
 
  is large enough compared to the number of vertices in 
 
 
 
 .26

Arboricity. Let 
 
 
 
  be the arboricity of a graph 
 
 
 
 . Every graph 
 
 
 
  with maximum degree

 
  has 
 
 
 
 .27

Graph Classes
For a class 
 
 
 
  of graphs, we denote by 
 
 
 
  the smallest integer 
 
 
 
  such that every graph 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  has 
 
 
 
 . In other words, 
 
 
 
  is the exact upper bound for the game chromatic index of graphs in this class. This value is known for several standard graph classes, and bounded for some others:

Forests

 
  when 
 
 
 
 , and

  Moreover, if every tree of a forest 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is obtained by subdivision from a caterpillar tree or contains no two adjacent vertices with degree 4, then 
 
 
 
 .30

Open Problems
Upper bound. Is there a constant 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for each graph 
 
 
 
  ? If it is true, is 
 
 
 
  enough ?31
Conjecture on large minimum degrees. There are a 
 
 
 
  and an integer 
 
 
 
  such that any graph 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  satisfies 
 
 
 
 . 32
Incidence coloring game
The incidence coloring game is a graph coloring game, introduced by Andres,33 and similar to the vertex coloring game, except Alice and Bob construct a proper incidence coloring instead of a proper vertex coloring. Its rules are as follows:

Alice and Bob are coloring the incidences of a graph G with a set k of colors.
Alice and Bob are taking turns, coloring properly a uncolored incidence (in the standard version, Alice begins).
If an incidence i is impossible to color properly (for any color, i is adjacent to an incident colored with it), then Bob wins.
If all the incidences are properly colored, then Alice wins.

The incidence game chromatic number of a graph 
 
 
 
 , denoted by 
 
 
 
 , is the minimum number of colors needed for Alice to win this game on 
 
 
 
 .
For every graph 
 
 
 
  with maximum degree 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
 .34
Relations with other notions

' (a,d)-Decomposition.' This is the best upper bound we know for the general case. If the edges of a graph 
 
 
 
  can be partitionned into two sets, one of them inducing a graph with arboricity

 
 , the second inducing a graph with maximum degree 
 
 
 
 , then

  If moreover 
 
 
 
 , then

Degeneracy. If 
 
 
 
  is a k-degenerated graph with maximum degree

 
 , then

Graph Classes

  of graphs, we denote by

 , if 
 
 
 
  is a subgraph of 
 
 
 
  having

Open Problems

Is the upper bound 
 
 
 
  tight for every value of 
 
 
 
  ?42
Is the incidence game chromatic number a monotonic parameter (i.e. is it as least as big for a graph G as for any subgraph of G) ?43

With less colors than the chromatic number, there is no proper coloring of G and so Alice cannot win. With most colors than the maximum degree, there is always an available color for coloring a vertex and so Alice cannot lose.
