Quasi-continuous function

In mathematics, the notion of a quasi-continuous function is similar to, but weaker than, the notion of a continuous function. All continuous functions are quasi-continuous but the converse is not true in general.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a topological space. A real-valued function 
 
 
 
  is quasi-continuous at a point 
 
 
 
  if for any every 
 
 
 
  and any open neighborhood

 
  of 
 
 
 
  there is a non-empty open set

 
  such that



Note that in the above definition, it is not necessary that 
 
 
 
 .
Properties

If 
 
 
 
  is continuous then 
 
 
 
  is quasi-continuous
If 
 
 
 
  is continuous and 
 
 
 
  is quasi-continuous, then 
 
 
 
  is quasi-continuous.

Example
Consider the function 
 
 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
  whenever 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  whenever 
 
 
 
 . Clearly f is continuous everywhere except at x=0, thus quasi-continuous everywhere except at x=0. At x=0, take any open neighborhood U of x. Then there exists an open set 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . Clearly this yields 
 
 
 
  thus f is quasi-continuous.
