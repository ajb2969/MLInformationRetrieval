   Quasi-continuous function      Quasi-continuous function   In mathematics , the notion of a quasi-continuous function is similar to, but weaker than, the notion of a continuous function . All continuous functions are quasi-continuous but the converse is not true in general.  Definition  Let   X   X   X   be a topological space . A real-valued function    f  :   X  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  ℝ     f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   is quasi-continuous at a point    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   if for any every    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   and any open neighborhood    U   U   U   of   x   x   x   there is a non-empty open set     G  ⊂  U      G  U    G\subset U   such that        |    f   (  x  )    -   f   (  y  )     |   <  ϵ     ∀  y   ∈  G      formulae-sequence          f  x     f  y     ϵ      for-all  y   G     |f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon\;\;\;\;\forall y\in G     Note that in the above definition, it is not necessary that    x  ∈  G      x  G    x\in G   .  Properties   If    f  :   X  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  ℝ     f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   is continuous then   f   f   f   is quasi-continuous  If    f  :   X  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  ℝ     f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   is continuous and    g  :   X  →  ℝ      normal-:  g   normal-→  X  ℝ     g:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   is quasi-continuous, then    f  +  g      f  g    f+g   is quasi-continuous.   Example  Consider the function    f  :   ℝ  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  ℝ  ℝ     f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   defined by     f   (  x  )    =  0        f  x   0    f(x)=0   whenever    x  ≤  0      x  0    x\leq 0   and     f   (  x  )    =  1        f  x   1    f(x)=1   whenever    x  >  0      x  0    x>0   . Clearly f is continuous everywhere except at x=0, thus quasi-continuous everywhere except at x=0. At x=0, take any open neighborhood U of x. Then there exists an open set    G  ⊂  U      G  U    G\subset U   such that    y  <    0    ∀  y    ∈  G        y    0   for-all  y         G     y<0\;\forall y\in G   . Clearly this yields     |    f   (  0  )    -   f   (  y  )     |   =    0    ∀  y    ∈  G              f  0     f  y       0   for-all  y         G     |f(0)-f(y)|=0\;\forall y\in G   thus f is quasi-continuous.
