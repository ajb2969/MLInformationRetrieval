}}  In probability theory and statistics, the chi distribution is a continuous probability distribution. It is the distribution of the square root of the sum of squares of independent random variables having a standard normal distribution. The most familiar example is the Maxwell distribution of (normalized) molecular speeds which is a chi distribution with 3 degrees of freedom (one for each spatial coordinate). If 
 
 
 
  are k independent, normally distributed random variables with means 
 
 
 
  and standard deviations

 
 
 , then the statistic



is distributed according to the chi distribution. Accordingly, dividing by the mean of the chi distribution (scaled by the square root of n − 1) yields the correction factor in the unbiased estimation of the standard deviation of the normal distribution. The chi distribution has one parameter
 
 
 
  which specifies the number of degrees of freedom (i.e. the number of 
 
 
 
 ).
Characterization
Probability density function
The probability density function is



where 
 
 
 
 
  is the Gamma function.
Cumulative distribution function
The cumulative distribution function is given by:



where 
 
 
 
  is the regularized Gamma function.
Generating functions
Moment generating function
The moment generating function is given by:






Characteristic function
The characteristic function is given by:






where again, 
 
 
 
  is Kummer's confluent hypergeometric function.
Properties
Differential equation



Moments
The raw moments are then given by:



where 
 
 
 
  is the Gamma function. The first few raw moments are:


















where the rightmost expressions are derived using the recurrence relationship for the Gamma function:



From these expressions we may derive the following relationships:
Mean
 
 

Variance
 
 

Skewness
 
 

Kurtosis excess
 
 

Entropy
The entropy is given by:



where 
 
 
 
  is the polygamma function.
