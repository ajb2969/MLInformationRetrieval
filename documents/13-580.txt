Krasner's lemma

In number theory, more specifically in p-adic analysis, Krasner's lemma is a basic result relating the topology of a complete non-archimedean field to its algebraic extensions.
Statement
Let K be a complete non-archimedean field and let 
 
 
 
  be a separable closure of K. Given an element α in 
 
 
 
 , denote its Galois conjugates by α2, ..., αn. Krasner's lemma states:12

if an element β of 
 
 
 
  is such that
 
 



then K(α) ⊆ K(β).
 

Applications

Krasner's lemma can be used to show that 

 
 -adic completion and separable closure of global fields commute.3 In other words, given 
 
 
 
  a prime of a global field L, the separable closure of the 
 
 
 
 -adic completion of L equals the 
 
 
 
 -adic completion of the separable closure of L (where 
 
 
 
 
  is a prime of 
 
 
 
  above 
 
 
 
 ).


Another application is to proving that Cp — the completion of the algebraic closure of Qp — is algebraically closed.45

Generalization
Krasner's lemma has the following generalization.6 Consider a monic polynomial








of degree n > 1 with coefficients in a Henselian field (K, v) and roots in the algebraic closure 
 
 
 
 . Let I and J be two disjoint, non-empty sets with union {1,...,n}. Moreover, consider a polynomial








with coefficients and roots in 
 
 
 
 . Assume








Then the coefficients of the polynomials








are contained in the field extension of K generated by the coefficients of g. (The original Krasner's lemma corresponds to the situation where g has degree 1.)
