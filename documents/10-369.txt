Grothendieck construction

The Grothendieck construction is a construction used in the mathematical field of category theory.
Let



be a functor from any small category to the category of small categories. The Grothendieck construction for

objects being pairs 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and

morphisms 
 
 
 
  being pairs 
 
 
 
  such that
