Definite quadratic form

In mathematics, a definite quadratic form is a quadratic form over some real vector space

 
  that has the same sign (always positive or always negative) for every nonzero vector of 
 
 
 
 . According to that sign, the quadratic form is called positive definite or negative definite.
A semidefinite (or semi-definite) quadratic form is defined in the same way, except that "positive" and "negative" are replaced by "not negative" and "not positive", respectively. An indefinite quadratic form is one that takes on both positive and negative values.
More generally, the definition applies to a vector space over an ordered field.1
Associated symmetric bilinear form
Quadratic forms correspond one-to-one to symmetric bilinear forms over the same space.2 A symmetric bilinear form is also described as definite, semidefinite, etc. according to its associated quadratic form. A quadratic form 
 
 
 
  and its associated symmetric bilinear form 
 
 
 
  are related by the following equations:






Example
As an example, let 
 
 
 
 , and consider the quadratic form


 
  where  and  and  are constants. If  and , the quadratic form 
 
 
 
  is positive definite. If one of the constants is positive and the other is zero, then 
 
 
 
  is positive semidefinite. If  and , then 
 
 
 
  is indefinite.

This is true only over a field of characteristic different of 2, but here we consider only ordered fields which necessarily have characteristic 0.
