In probability theory and statistics, the noncentral chi distribution is a generalization of the chi distribution. If 
 
 
 
  are k independent, normally distributed random variables with means 
 
 
 
  and variances 
 
 
 
 , then the statistic



is distributed according to the noncentral chi distribution. The noncentral chi distribution has two parameters
 
 
 
  which specifies the number of degrees of freedom (i.e. the number of 
 
 
 
 ), and 
 
 
 
  which is related to the mean of the random variables 
 
 
 
  by:



Properties
Probability density function
The probability density function (pdf) is



where 
 
 
 
  is a modified Bessel function of the first kind.
Raw moments
The first few raw moments are:












where 
 
 
 
  is the generalized Laguerre polynomial. Note that the 2
 
 
 
 th moment is the same as the 
 
 
 
 th moment of the noncentral chi-squared distribution with 
 
 
 
  being replaced by 
 
 
 
 .
Differential equation
The pdf of the noncentral chi distribution is a solution to the following differential equation:



Bivariate non-central chi distribution
Let 
 
 
 
 , be a set of n independent and identically distributed bivariate normal random vectors with marginal distributions 
 
 
 
 , correlation 
 
 
 
 , and mean vector and covariance matrix


 
  with 
 
 
positive definite. Define


 
  Then the joint distribution of U, V is central or noncentral bivariate chi distribution with n degrees of freedom.12 If either or both 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  the distribution is a noncentral bivariate chi distribution.
Related distributions

If 
 
 
 
  is a random variable with the non-central chi distribution, the random variable 
 
 
 
  will have the noncentral chi-squared distribution. Other related distributions may be seen there.


If 
 
 
 
  is chi distributed
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is also non-central chi distributed
 
 
 
 . In other words, the chi distribution is a special case of the non-central chi distribution (i.e., with a non-centrality parameter of zero).


A noncentral chi distribution with 2 degrees of freedom is equivalent to a Rice distribution with 
 
 
 
 .


If X follows a noncentral chi distribution with 1 degree of freedom and noncentrality parameter λ, then σX follows a folded normal distribution whose parameters are equal to σλ and σ2 for any value of σ.

Applications
The Euclidean norm of a multivariate normally distributed random vector follows a noncentral chi distribution.
