Enneacontagon

In geometry, an enneacontagon or enenecontagon (from Ancient Greek ἑννενήκοντα, ninety1) is a ninety-sided polygon.23 The sum of any enneacontagon's interior angles is 15840 degrees.
A regular enneacontagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {90} and can be constructed as a quasiregular truncated 45-gon, t{45}, which alternates two types of edges.
Regular enneacontagon properties
One interior angle in a regular enneacontagon is 176°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 4°.
The area of a regular enneacontagon is (with )



and its inradius is



The circumradius of a regular enneacontagon is



A regular enneacontagon is not constructible using a compass and straightedge,4 but is constructible if the use of an angle trisector is allowed.5
Enneacontagram
An enneacontagram is a 90-sided star polygon. There are 11 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols {90/7}, {90/11}, {90/13}, {90/17}, {90/19}, {90/23}, {90/29}, {90/31}, {90/37}, {90/41}, and {90/43}, as well as 33 regular star figures with the same vertex configuration.
