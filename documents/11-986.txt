   Sinapoylglucose—malate O-sinapoyltransferase      Sinapoylglucose—malate O-sinapoyltransferase   In enzymology , a sinapoylglucose---malate O-sinapoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1-O-sinapoyl-beta-D-glucose + (S)-malate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucose + sinapoyl-(S)-malate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-O-sinapoyl-beta-D-glucose and (S)-malate , whereas its two products are D-glucose and sinapoyl-(S)-malate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-O-sinapoyl-beta-D-glucose:(S)-malate O-sinapoyltransferase . Other names in common use include 1-sinapoylglucose-L-malate sinapoyltransferase , and sinapoylglucose:malate sinapoyltransferase . This enzyme participates in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis .
