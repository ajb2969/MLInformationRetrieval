   Selberg's zeta function conjecture      Selberg's zeta function conjecture   In mathematics, the Selberg conjecture , named after Atle Selberg , is about the density of zeros of the Riemann zeta function ζ(1/2 + it ). It is known that the function has infinitely many zeroes on this line in the complex plane: the point at issue is how densely they are clustered. Results on this can be formulated in terms of N ( T ), the function counting zeroes on the line for which the value of t satisfies 0 ≤ t ≤ T .  Background  In 1942 Atle Selberg investigated the problem of the Hardy–Littlewood conjecture 2 ; and he proved that for any      ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0     there exist       T  0   =    T  0    (  ε  )    >  0         subscript  T  0      subscript  T  0   ε        0     T_{0}=T_{0}(\varepsilon)>0     and       c  =   c   (  ε  )    >  0   ,        c    c  ε        0     c=c(\varepsilon)>0,     such that for      T  ≥   T  0       T   subscript  T  0     T\geq T_{0}     and      H  =   T   0.5  +  ε        H   superscript  T    0.5  ε      H=T^{0.5+\varepsilon}     the inequality        N   (   T  +  H   )    -   N   (  T  )     ≥   c  H   log  T            N    T  H      N  T      c  H    T      N(T+H)-N(T)\geq cH\log T     holds true.  In his turn, Selberg stated a conjecture relating to shorter intervals, 1 namely that it is possible to decrease the value of the exponent a = 0.5 in       H  =   T   0.5  +  ε     .      H   superscript  T    0.5  ε      H=T^{0.5+\varepsilon}.     Proof of the conjecture  In 1984 Anatolii Karatsuba proved 2 3 4 that for a fixed   ε   ε   \varepsilon   satisfying the condition       0  <  ε  <  0.001   ,        0  ε       0.001     0<\varepsilon<0.001,     a sufficiently large T and       H  =   T   a  +  ε     ,      H   superscript  T    a  ε      H=T^{a+\varepsilon},        a  =   27  82   =    1  3   -   1  246     ,        a    27  82            1  3     1  246       a=\tfrac{27}{82}=\tfrac{1}{3}-\tfrac{1}{246},     the interval in the ordinate t ( T , T + H ) contains at least cH ln T real zeros of the Riemann zeta function       ζ   (     1  2    +   i  t    )    ;      ζ      1  2     i  t      \zeta\Bigl(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\Bigr);     and thereby confirmed the Selberg conjecture. The estimates of Selberg and Karatsuba cannot be improved in respect of the order of growth as T → +∞.  Further work  In 1992 Karatsuba proved 5 that an analog of the Selberg conjecture holds for "almost all" intervals ( T , T + H ], H = T ε , where ε is an arbitrarily small fixed positive number. The Karatsuba method permits one to investigate zeroes of the Riemann zeta-function on "supershort" intervals of the critical line, that is, on the intervals ( T , T + H ], the length H of which grows slower than any, even arbitrarily small degree T .  In particular, he proved that for any given numbers ε, ε 1 satisfying the conditions 0 1 ε] contain at least H (ln T ) 1 −ε 1 zeros of the function ζ(1/2 + it ). This estimate is quite close to the conditional result that follows from the Riemann hypothesis .
