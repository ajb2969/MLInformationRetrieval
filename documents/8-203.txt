Defective matrix

In linear algebra, a defective matrix is a square matrix that does not have a complete basis of eigenvectors, and is therefore not diagonalizable. In particular, an n × n matrix is defective if and only if it does not have n linearly independent eigenvectors.1 A complete basis is formed by augmenting the eigenvectors with generalized eigenvectors, which are necessary for solving defective systems of ordinary differential equations and other problems.
A defective matrix always has fewer than n distinct eigenvalues, since distinct eigenvalues always have linearly independent eigenvectors. In particular, a defective matrix has one or more eigenvalues λ with algebraic multiplicity m > 1 (that is, they are multiple roots of the characteristic polynomial), but fewer than m linearly independent eigenvectors associated with λ. If the algebraic multiplicity of λ exceeds its geometric multiplicity, then λ is said to be a defective eigenvalue.2 However, every eigenvalue with algebraic multiplicity m always has m linearly independent generalized eigenvectors.
A Hermitian matrix (or the special case of a real symmetric matrix) or a unitary matrix is never defective; more generally, a normal matrix (which includes Hermitian and unitary as special cases) is never defective.
Jordan block
Any Jordan block of size 2×2 or larger is defective. For example, the n × n Jordan block,


 
  has an eigenvalue, λ, with algebraic multiplicity n, but only one distinct eigenvector,



Example
A simple example of a defective matrix is:


 
  which has a double eigenvalue of 3 but only one distinct eigenvector


 
  (and constant multiples thereof).
