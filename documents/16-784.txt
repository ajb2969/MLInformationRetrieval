   Pseudofunctor      Pseudofunctor   In mathematics, a pseudofunctor  f is a mapping between categories that is just like a functor except that     f   (   x  ∘  y   )    =     f   (  x  )    ∘  f    (  y  )          f    x  y          f  x   f   y     f(x\circ y)=f(x)\circ f(y)   and     f   (  1  )    =  1        f  1   1    f(1)=1   do not hold as exact equalities but only up to coherent isomorphisms .  The Grothendieck construction associates to a pseudofunctor a fibered category .  See also   lax functor  prestack (an example of pseudofunctor)   References   C.
