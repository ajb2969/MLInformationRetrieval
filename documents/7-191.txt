   Cauchy stress tensor      Cauchy stress tensor   In continuum mechanics , the Cauchy stress tensor    𝝈   𝝈   \boldsymbol{\sigma}\,\!   , true stress tensor , 1 or simply called the stress tensor , named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy , is a second order tensor of type (1,1) (that is, a linear map ), with nine components    σ   i  j      subscript  σ    i  j     \sigma_{ij}\,\!   that completely define the state of stress at a point inside a material in the deformed placement or configuration. The tensor relates a unit-length direction vector n to the stress vector T ( n ) across an imaginary surface perpendicular to n :         𝐓   (  𝐧  )    =    𝐧  ⋅  𝝈   or      T  j   (  n  )    =    σ   i  j     n  i      .     formulae-sequence     superscript  𝐓  𝐧     normal-⋅  𝐧  𝝈   or       superscript   subscript  T  j   n      subscript  σ    i  j     subscript  n  i       \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})}=\mathbf{n}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}\quad\text{or}%

A graphical representation of this transformation law is the Mohr's circle for stress.  The Cauchy stress tensor is used for stress analysis of material bodies experiencing small deformations : It is a central concept in the linear theory of elasticity . For large deformations, also called finite deformations , other measures of stress are required, such as the Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor , the Biot stress tensor , and the Kirchhoff stress tensor .  According to the principle of conservation of linear momentum , if the continuum body is in static equilibrium it can be demonstrated that the components of the Cauchy stress tensor in every material point in the body satisfy the equilibrium equations ( Cauchy's equations of motion for zero acceleration). At the same time, according to the principle of conservation of angular momentum , equilibrium requires that the summation of moments with respect to an arbitrary point is zero, which leads to the conclusion that the stress tensor is symmetric , thus having only six independent stress components, instead of the original nine.  There are certain invariants associated with the stress tensor, whose values do not depend upon the coordinate system chosen, or the area element upon which the stress tensor operates. These are the three eigenvalues of the stress tensor, which are called the principal stresses .  Euler-Cauchy stress principle - stress vector    The Euler–Cauchy stress principle states that upon any surface (real or imaginary) that divides the body, the action of one part of the body on the other is equivalent (equipollent) to the system of distributed forces and couples on the surface dividing the body , 2 and it is represented by a field    𝐓   (  𝐧  )      superscript  𝐓  𝐧    \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})}   , called the stress vector, defined on the surface   S   S   S\,\!   and assumed to depend continuously on the surface's unit vector   𝐧   𝐧   \mathbf{n}\,\!   . 3 4  To formulate the Euler–Cauchy stress principle, consider an imaginary surface   S   S   S\,\!   passing through an internal material point   P   P   P\,\!   dividing the continuous body into two segments, as seen in Figure 2.1a or 2.1b (one may use either the cutting plane diagram or the diagram with the arbitrary volume inside the continuum enclosed by the surface   S   S   S\,\!   ).  Following the classical dynamics of Newton and Euler , the motion of a material body is produced by the action of externally applied forces which are assumed to be of two kinds: surface forces    𝐅   𝐅   \mathbf{F}   and body forces   𝐛   𝐛   \mathbf{b}   . 5 Thus, the total force   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   applied to a body or to a portion of the body can be expressed as:      ℱ  =   𝐛  +  𝐅       ℱ    𝐛  𝐅     \mathcal{F}=\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{F}     Only surface forces will be discussed in this article as they are relevant to the Cauchy stress tensor.  When the body is subjected to external surface forces or contact forces    𝐅   𝐅   \mathbf{F}\,\!   , following Euler's equations of motion , internal contact forces and moments are transmitted from point to point in the body, and from one segment to the other through the dividing surface   S   S   S\,\!   , due to the mechanical contact of one portion of the continuum onto the other (Figure 2.1a and 2.1b). On an element of area    Δ  S      normal-Δ  S    \Delta S\,\!   containing   P   P   P\,\!   , with normal vector    𝐧   𝐧   \mathbf{n}   , the force distribution is equipollent to a contact force    Δ  𝐅      normal-Δ  𝐅    \Delta\mathbf{F}\,\!   and surface moment    Δ  𝐌      normal-Δ  𝐌    \Delta\mathbf{M}\,\!   . In particular, the contact force is given by       Δ  𝐅   =     𝐓   (  𝐧  )     Δ  S         normal-Δ  𝐅      superscript  𝐓  𝐧   normal-Δ  S     \Delta\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})}\,\Delta S     where    𝐓   (  𝐧  )      superscript  𝐓  𝐧    \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})}   is the mean surface traction .  Cauchy’s stress principle asserts 6 that as    Δ  S      normal-Δ  S    \Delta S\,\!   becomes very small and tends to zero the ratio      Δ  𝐅   /  Δ   S          normal-Δ  𝐅   normal-Δ   S    \Delta\mathbf{F}/\Delta S\,\!   becomes      d  𝐅   /  d   S          d  𝐅   d   S    d\mathbf{F}/dS\,\!   and the couple stress vector    Δ  𝐌      normal-Δ  𝐌    \Delta\mathbf{M}\,\!   vanishes. In specific fields of continuum mechanics the couple stress is assumed not to vanish; however, classical branches of continuum mechanics address non- polar materials which do not consider couple stresses and body moments.  The resultant vector      d  𝐅   /  d   S          d  𝐅   d   S    d\mathbf{F}/dS\,\!   is defined as the surface traction , 7 also called stress vector , 8  traction , 9 or traction vector . 10 given by     𝐓   (  𝐧  )    =    T  i   (  𝐧  )     𝐞  i         superscript  𝐓  𝐧      superscript   subscript  T  i   𝐧    subscript  𝐞  i      \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})}=T_{i}^{(\mathbf{n})}\mathbf{e}_{i}\,\!   at the point   P   P   P\,\!   associated with a plane with a normal vector   𝐧   𝐧   \mathbf{n}\,\!   :        T  i   (  𝐧  )    =    lim    Δ  S   →  0      Δ   F  i     Δ  S     =    d   F  i     d  S     .         subscript   superscript  T  𝐧   i     subscript    normal-→    normal-Δ  S   0        normal-Δ   subscript  F  i      normal-Δ  S              d   subscript  F  i      d  S       T^{(\mathbf{n})}_{i}=\lim_{\Delta S\to 0}\frac{\Delta F_{i}}{\Delta S}={dF_{i}%
 \over dS}.     This equation means that the stress vector depends on its location in the body and the orientation of the plane on which it is acting.  This implies that the balancing action of internal contact forces generates a contact force density or Cauchy traction field  11     𝐓   (  𝐧  ,  𝐱  ,  t  )       𝐓   𝐧  𝐱  t     \mathbf{T}(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x},t)   that represents a distribution of internal contact forces throughout the volume of the body in a particular configuration of the body at a given time   t   t   t\,\!   . It is not a vector field because it depends not only on the position   𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}   of a particular material point, but also on the local orientation of the surface element as defined by its normal vector   𝐧   𝐧   \mathbf{n}   . 12  Depending on the orientation of the plane under consideration, the stress vector may not necessarily be perpendicular to that plane, i.e. parallel to   𝐧   𝐧   \mathbf{n}\,\!   , and can be resolved into two components (Figure 2.1c):   one normal to the plane, called normal stress         σ  n   =    lim    Δ  S   →  0      Δ   F  n     Δ  S     =    d   F  n     d  S     ,         subscript  σ  normal-n     subscript    normal-→    normal-Δ  S   0        normal-Δ   subscript  F  normal-n      normal-Δ  S              d   subscript  F  normal-n      d  S       \mathbf{\sigma_{\mathrm{n}}}=\lim_{\Delta S\to 0}\frac{\Delta F_{\mathrm{n}}}{%
 \Delta S}=\frac{dF_{\mathrm{n}}}{dS},      where    d   F  n       d   subscript  F  normal-n     dF_{\mathrm{n}}\,\!   is the normal component of the force    d  𝐅      d  𝐅    d\mathbf{F}\,\!   to the differential area    d  S      d  S    dS\,\!       and the other parallel to this plane, called the shear stress        τ  =    lim    Δ  S   →  0      Δ   F  s     Δ  S     =    d   F  s     d  S     ,        τ    subscript    normal-→    normal-Δ  S   0        normal-Δ   subscript  F  normal-s      normal-Δ  S              d   subscript  F  normal-s      d  S       \mathbf{\tau}=\lim_{\Delta S\to 0}\frac{\Delta F_{\mathrm{s}}}{\Delta S}=\frac%
 {dF_{\mathrm{s}}}{dS},      where    d   F  s       d   subscript  F  normal-s     dF_{\mathrm{s}}\,\!   is the tangential component of the force    d  𝐅      d  𝐅    d\mathbf{F}\,\!   to the differential surface area    d  S      d  S    dS\,\!   . The shear stress can be further decomposed into two mutually perpendicular vectors.   Cauchy’s postulate  According to the Cauchy Postulate , the stress vector    𝐓   (  𝐧  )      superscript  𝐓  𝐧    \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})}   remains unchanged for all surfaces passing through the point   P   P   P\,\!   and having the same normal vector   𝐧   𝐧   \mathbf{n}\,\!   at   P   P   P\,\!   , 13 14 i.e., having a common tangent at   P   P   P\,\!   . This means that the stress vector is a function of the normal vector   𝐧   𝐧   \mathbf{n}\,\!   only, and is not influenced by the curvature of the internal surfaces.  Cauchy’s fundamental lemma  A consequence of Cauchy’s postulate is Cauchy’s Fundamental Lemma , 15 16 17 also called the Cauchy reciprocal theorem , 18 which states that the stress vectors acting on opposite sides of the same surface are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Cauchy’s fundamental lemma is equivalent to Newton's third law of motion of action and reaction, and is expressed as        -   𝐓   (  𝐧  )     =   𝐓   (   -  𝐧   )     .         superscript  𝐓  𝐧     superscript  𝐓    𝐧      -\mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})}=\mathbf{T}^{(-\mathbf{n})}.\,\!     Cauchy’s stress theorem—stress tensor  The state of stress at a point in the body is then defined by all the stress vectors T ( n ) associated with all planes (infinite in number) that pass through that point. 19 However, according to Cauchy’s fundamental theorem , 20 also called Cauchy’s stress theorem , 21 merely by knowing the stress vectors on three mutually perpendicular planes, the stress vector on any other plane passing through that point can be found through coordinate transformation equations.  Cauchy’s stress theorem states that there exists a second-order tensor field  σ ( x , t), called the Cauchy stress tensor, independent of n , such that T is a linear function of n :         𝐓   (  𝐧  )    =    𝐧  ⋅  𝝈   or      T  j   (  n  )    =    σ   i  j     n  i      .     formulae-sequence     superscript  𝐓  𝐧     normal-⋅  𝐧  𝝈   or       superscript   subscript  T  j   n      subscript  σ    i  j     subscript  n  i       \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})}=\mathbf{n}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}\quad\text{or}%
 \quad T_{j}^{(n)}=\sigma_{ij}n_{i}.\,\!     This equation implies that the stress vector T ( n ) at any point P in a continuum associated with a plane with normal unit vector n can be expressed as a function of the stress vectors on the planes perpendicular to the coordinate axes, i.e. in terms of the components σ ij of the stress tensor σ .  To prove this expression, consider a tetrahedron with three faces oriented in the coordinate planes, and with an infinitesimal area d A oriented in an arbitrary direction specified by a normal unit vector n (Figure 2.2). The tetrahedron is formed by slicing the infinitesimal element along an arbitrary plane n . The stress vector on this plane is denoted by T ( n ) . The stress vectors acting on the faces of the tetrahedron are denoted as T ( e 1 ) , T ( e 2 ) , and T ( e 3 ) , and are by definition the components σ ij of the stress tensor σ . This tetrahedron is sometimes called the Cauchy tetrahedron . The equilibrium of forces, i.e.  Euler’s first law of motion (Newton’s second law of motion), gives:           𝐓   (  𝐧  )     d  A   -     𝐓   (   𝐞  1   )     d   A  1    -     𝐓   (   𝐞  2   )     d   A  2    -     𝐓   (   𝐞  3   )     d   A  3     =   ρ   (    h  3   d  A   )   𝐚    ,           superscript  𝐓  𝐧   d  A      superscript  𝐓   subscript  𝐞  1    d   subscript  A  1       superscript  𝐓   subscript  𝐞  2    d   subscript  A  2       superscript  𝐓   subscript  𝐞  3    d   subscript  A  3       ρ      h  3   d  A   𝐚     \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})}\,dA-\mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_{1})}\,dA_{1}-\mathbf{T}%

A note on the sign convention: The tetrahedron is formed by slicing a parallelepiped along an arbitrary plane n . So, the force acting on the plane n is the reaction exerted by the other half of the parallelepiped and has an opposite sign.   where the right-hand-side represents the product of the mass enclosed by the tetrahedron and its acceleration: ρ is the density, a is the acceleration, and h is the height of the tetrahedron, considering the plane n as the base.

Assuming a material element (Figure 2.3) with planes perpendicular to the coordinate axes of a Cartesian coordinate system, the stress vectors associated with each of the element planes, i.e.  T ( e 1 ) , T ( e 2 ) , and T ( e 3 ) can be decomposed into a normal component and two shear components, i.e. components in the direction of the three coordinate axes.

Derivation of equilibrium equations       Consider a continuum body (see Figure 4) occupying a volume   V   V   V\,\!   , having a surface area   S   S   S\,\!   , with defined traction or surface forces    T  i   (  n  )      superscript   subscript  T  i   n    T_{i}^{(n)}\,\!   per unit area acting on every point of the body surface, and body forces    F  i     subscript  F  i    F_{i}\,\!   per unit of volume on every point within the volume   V   V   V\,\!   . Thus, if the body is in equilibrium the resultant force acting on the volume is zero, thus:         ∫  S     T  i   (  n  )    d  S    +    ∫  V     F  i   d  V     =  0          subscript   S      superscript   subscript  T  i   n   d  S      subscript   V      subscript  F  i   d  V     0    \int_{S}T_{i}^{(n)}dS+\int_{V}F_{i}dV=0\,\!   By definition the stress vector is     T  i   (  n  )    =    σ   j  i     n  j         superscript   subscript  T  i   n      subscript  σ    j  i     subscript  n  j      T_{i}^{(n)}=\sigma_{ji}n_{j}\,\!   , then         ∫  S     σ   j  i      n  j    d  S    +    ∫  V      F  i    d  V     =  0          subscript   S      subscript  σ    j  i     subscript  n  j   d  S      subscript   V      subscript  F  i   d  V     0    \int_{S}\sigma_{ji}n_{j}\,dS+\int_{V}F_{i}\,dV=0\,\!   Using the Gauss's divergence theorem to convert a surface integral to a volume integral gives         ∫  V      σ    j  i   ,  j     d  V    +    ∫  V      F  i    d  V     =  0          subscript   V      subscript  σ     j  i   j    d  V      subscript   V      subscript  F  i   d  V     0    \int_{V}\sigma_{ji,j}\,dV+\int_{V}F_{i}\,dV=0\,\!           ∫  V     (    σ    j  i   ,  j    +    F  i     )   d  V    =  0        subscript   V        subscript  σ     j  i   j     subscript  F  i    d  V    0    \int_{V}(\sigma_{ji,j}+F_{i}\,)dV=0\,\!   For an arbitrary volume the integral vanishes, and we have the equilibrium equations        σ    j  i   ,  j    +   F  i    =  0         subscript  σ     j  i   j     subscript  F  i    0    \sigma_{ji,j}+F_{i}=0\,\!          Cauchy's second law of motion  According to the principle of conservation of angular momentum , equilibrium requires that the summation of moments with respect to an arbitrary point is zero, which leads to the conclusion that the stress tensor is symmetric , thus having only six independent stress components, instead of the original nine:       σ   i  j    =   σ   j  i         subscript  σ    i  j     subscript  σ    j  i      \sigma_{ij}=\sigma_{ji}\,\!           Derivation of symmetry of the stress tensor       Summing moments about point O (Figure 4) the resultant moment is zero as the body is in equilibrium.

Expanding this equation we have       σ  12   =   σ  21        subscript  σ  12    subscript  σ  21     \sigma_{12}=\sigma_{21}\,\!   ,     σ  23   =   σ  32        subscript  σ  23    subscript  σ  32     \sigma_{23}=\sigma_{32}\,\!   , and     σ  13   =   σ  31        subscript  σ  13    subscript  σ  31     \sigma_{13}=\sigma_{31}\,\!   or in general       σ   i  j    =   σ   j  i         subscript  σ    i  j     subscript  σ    j  i      \sigma_{ij}=\sigma_{ji}\,\!   This proves that the stress tensor is symmetric       However, in the presence of couple-stresses, i.e. moments per unit volume, the stress tensor is non-symmetric. This also is the case when the Knudsen number is close to one,     K  n   →  1     normal-→   subscript  K  n   1    K_{n}\rightarrow 1\,\!   , or the continuum is a non-Newtonian fluid, which can lead to rotationally non-invariant fluids, such as polymers .  Principal stresses and stress invariants  At every point in a stressed body there are at least three planes, called principal planes , with normal vectors   𝐧   𝐧   \mathbf{n}\,\!   , called principal directions , where the corresponding stress vector is perpendicular to the plane, i.e., parallel or in the same direction as the normal vector   𝐧   𝐧   \mathbf{n}\,\!   , and where there are no normal shear stresses    τ  n     subscript  τ  normal-n    \tau_{\mathrm{n}}\,\!   . The three stresses normal to these principal planes are called principal stresses .  The components    σ   i  j      subscript  σ    i  j     \sigma_{ij}\,\!   of the stress tensor depend on the orientation of the coordinate system at the point under consideration. However, the stress tensor itself is a physical quantity and as such, it is independent of the coordinate system chosen to represent it. There are certain invariants associated with every tensor which are also independent of the coordinate system. For example, a vector is a simple tensor of rank one. In three dimensions, it has three components. The value of these components will depend on the coordinate system chosen to represent the vector, but the magnitude of the vector is a physical quantity (a scalar) and is independent of the Cartesian coordinate system chosen to represent the vector. Similarly, every second rank tensor (such as the stress and the strain tensors) has three independent invariant quantities associated with it. One set of such invariants are the principal stresses of the stress tensor, which are just the eigenvalues of the stress tensor. Their direction vectors are the principal directions or eigenvectors .  A stress vector parallel to the normal unit vector   𝐧   𝐧   \mathbf{n}\,\!   is given by:       𝐓   (  𝐧  )    =   λ  𝐧   =    σ  n   𝐧          superscript  𝐓  𝐧     λ  𝐧           subscript  σ  normal-n   𝐧      \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})}=\lambda\mathbf{n}=\mathbf{\sigma}_{\mathrm{n}}%
 \mathbf{n}\,\!     where   λ   λ   \lambda\,\!   is a constant of proportionality, and in this particular case corresponds to the magnitudes    σ  n     subscript  σ  normal-n    \sigma_{\mathrm{n}}\,\!   of the normal stress vectors or principal stresses.

The eigenvalues are the roots of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem . The principal stresses are unique for a given stress tensor. Therefore, from the characteristic equation, the coefficients    I  1     subscript  I  1    I_{1}\,\!   ,    I  2     subscript  I  2    I_{2}\,\!   and    I  3     subscript  I  3    I_{3}\,\!   , called the first, second, and third stress invariants , respectively, have always the same value regardless of the coordinate system's orientation.  For each eigenvalue, there is a non-trivial solution for    n  j     subscript  n  j    n_{j}\,\!   in the equation      (    σ   i  j    -   λ   δ   i  j      )    n  j    =  0           subscript  σ    i  j      λ   subscript  δ    i  j       subscript  n  j    0    \left(\sigma_{ij}-\lambda\delta_{ij}\right)n_{j}=0\,\!   . These solutions are the principal directions or eigenvectors defining the plane where the principal stresses act. The principal stresses and principal directions characterize the stress at a point and are independent of the orientation.  A coordinate system with axes oriented to the principal directions implies that the normal stresses are the principal stresses and the stress tensor is represented by a diagonal matrix:       σ   i  j    =   [      σ  1     0    0      0     σ  2     0      0    0     σ  3      ]        subscript  σ    i  j       subscript  σ  1   0  0    0   subscript  σ  2   0    0  0   subscript  σ  3       \sigma_{ij}=\begin{bmatrix}\sigma_{1}&0&0\\
 0&\sigma_{2}&0\\
 0&0&\sigma_{3}\end{bmatrix}\,\!     The principal stresses can be combined to form the stress invariants,    I  1     subscript  I  1    I_{1}\,\!   ,    I  2     subscript  I  2    I_{2}\,\!   , and    I  3     subscript  I  3    I_{3}\,\!   . The first and third invariant are the trace and determinant respectively, of the stress tensor. Thus,         I  1       =    σ  1   +   σ  2   +   σ  3          I  2       =     σ  1    σ  2    +    σ  2    σ  3    +    σ  3    σ  1           I  3       =    σ  1    σ  2    σ  3            subscript  I  1     absent     subscript  σ  1    subscript  σ  2    subscript  σ  3        subscript  I  2     absent       subscript  σ  1    subscript  σ  2       subscript  σ  2    subscript  σ  3       subscript  σ  3    subscript  σ  1         subscript  I  3     absent     subscript  σ  1    subscript  σ  2    subscript  σ  3        \begin{aligned}\displaystyle I_{1}&\displaystyle=\sigma_{1}+\sigma_{2}+\sigma_%

A first approach to solve these last three equations is to consider the trivial solution     n  i   =  0       subscript  n  i   0    n_{i}=0\,\!   . However this options does not fulfill the constrain      n  i    n  i    =  1         subscript  n  i    subscript  n  i    1    n_{i}n_{i}=1\,\!   . Considering the solution where     n  1   =   n  2   =  0         subscript  n  1    subscript  n  2        0     n_{1}=n_{2}=0\,\!   and     n  3   ≠  0       subscript  n  3   0    n_{3}\neq 0\,\!   , it is determine from the condition      n  i    n  i    =  1         subscript  n  i    subscript  n  i    1    n_{i}n_{i}=1\,\!   that     n  3   =   ±  1        subscript  n  3    plus-or-minus  1     n_{3}=\pm 1\,\!   , then from the original equation for    τ  n  2     superscript   subscript  τ  normal-n   2    \tau_{\mathrm{n}}^{2}\,\!   it is seen that     τ  n   =  0       subscript  τ  normal-n   0    \tau_{\mathrm{n}}=0\,\!   . The other two possible values for    τ  n     subscript  τ  normal-n    \tau_{\mathrm{n}}\,\!   can be obtained similarly by assuming       n  1   =   n  3   =  0         subscript  n  1    subscript  n  3        0     n_{1}=n_{3}=0\,\!   and     n  2   ≠  0       subscript  n  2   0    n_{2}\neq 0\,\!          n  2   =   n  3   =  0         subscript  n  2    subscript  n  3        0     n_{2}=n_{3}=0\,\!   and     n  1   ≠  0       subscript  n  1   0    n_{1}\neq 0\,\!

These correspond to minimum values for    τ  n     subscript  τ  normal-n    \tau_{\mathrm{n}}\,\!   and verifies that there are no shear stresses on planes normal to the principal directions of stress, as shown previously.

The deviatoric stress tensor can be obtained by subtracting the hydrostatic stress tensor from the Cauchy stress tensor:       s    i  j      subscript  s    i  j     \displaystyle\ s_{ij}     Invariants of the stress deviator tensor  As it is a second order tensor, the stress deviator tensor also has a set of invariants , which can be obtained using the same procedure used to calculate the invariants of the stress tensor. It can be shown that the principal directions of the stress deviator tensor    s   i  j      subscript  s    i  j     s_{ij}\,\!   are the same as the principal directions of the stress tensor    σ   i  j      subscript  σ    i  j     \sigma_{ij}\,\!   .

Their values are the same (invariant) regardless of the orientation of the coordinate system chosen. These deviatoric stress invariants can be expressed as a function of the components of    s   i  j      subscript  s    i  j     s_{ij}\,\!   or its principal values    s  1     subscript  s  1    s_{1}\,\!   ,    s  2     subscript  s  2    s_{2}\,\!   , and    s  3     subscript  s  3    s_{3}\,\!   , or alternatively, as a function of    σ   i  j      subscript  σ    i  j     \sigma_{ij}\,\!   or its principal values    σ  1     subscript  σ  1    \sigma_{1}\,\!   ,    σ  2     subscript  σ  2    \sigma_{2}\,\!   , and    σ  3     subscript  σ  3    \sigma_{3}\,\!   .

A quantity called the equivalent stress or von Mises stress is commonly used in solid mechanics. The equivalent stress is defined as        σ  e   =     3    J  2     =        1  2      [     (    σ  1   -   σ  2    )   2   +    (    σ  2   -   σ  3    )   2   +    (    σ  3   -   σ  1    )   2    ]       .         subscript  σ  normal-e       3   subscript  J  2                1  2    delimited-[]     superscript     subscript  σ  1    subscript  σ  2    2    superscript     subscript  σ  2    subscript  σ  3    2    superscript     subscript  σ  3    subscript  σ  1    2          \sigma_{\mathrm{e}}=\sqrt{3~{}J_{2}}=\sqrt{\tfrac{1}{2}~{}\left[(\sigma_{1}-%
