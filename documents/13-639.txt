   Double layer potential      Double layer potential   In potential theory , an area of mathematics , a double layer potential is a solution of Laplace's equation corresponding to the electrostatic or magnetic potential associated to a dipole distribution on a closed surface S in three-dimensions. Thus a double layer potential u ( x ) is a scalar-valued function of x ∈ R 3 given by       u   (  𝐱  )    =     -  1    4  π      ∫  S    ρ   (  𝐲  )    ∂   ∂  ν      1   |   𝐱  -  𝐲   |     d  σ   (  𝐲  )            u  𝐱         1     4  π      subscript   S     ρ  𝐲       ν      1      𝐱  𝐲     d  σ  𝐲       u(\mathbf{x})=\frac{-1}{4\pi}\int_{S}\rho(\mathbf{y})\frac{\partial}{\partial%

More generally, a double layer potential is associated to a hypersurface  S in n -dimensional Euclidean space by means of       u   (  𝐱  )    =    ∫  S    ρ   (  𝐲  )    ∂   ∂  ν    P   (   𝐱  -  𝐲   )   d  σ   (  𝐲  )           u  𝐱     subscript   S     ρ  𝐲       ν    P    𝐱  𝐲   d  σ  𝐲      u(\mathbf{x})=\int_{S}\rho(\mathbf{y})\frac{\partial}{\partial\nu}P(\mathbf{x}%
