Plus construction

In mathematics, the plus construction is a method for simplifying the fundamental group of a space without changing its homology and cohomology groups. It was introduced by , and was used by Daniel Quillen to define algebraic K-theory. Given a perfect normal subgroup of the fundamental group of a connected CW complex

 
 , attach two-cells along loops in 
 
 
 
  whose images in the fundamental group generate the subgroup. This operation generally changes the homology of the space, but these changes can be reversed by the addition of three-cells.
The most common application of the plus construction is in algebraic K-theory. If 
 
 
 
  is a unital ring, we denote by 
 
 
 
  the group of invertible

 
 -by-
 
 
matrices with elements in 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  embeds in 
 
 
 
  by attaching a 
 
 
 
  along the diagonal and 
 
 
 
 s elsewhere. The direct limit of these groups via these maps is denoted 
 
 
 
  and its classifying space is denoted 
 
 
 
 . The plus construction may then be applied to the perfect normal subgroup 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , generated by matrices which only differ from the identity matrix in one off-diagonal entry. For 
 
 
 
 , the 
 
 
 
 th homotopy group of the resulting space, 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
 th 
 
 
 
 -group of 
 
 
 
 ,
