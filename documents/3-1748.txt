   Plus construction      Plus construction   In mathematics , the plus construction is a method for simplifying the fundamental group of a space without changing its homology and cohomology  groups . It was introduced by , and was used by Daniel Quillen to define algebraic K-theory . Given a perfect  normal subgroup of the fundamental group of a connected CW complex    X   X   X   , attach two-cells along loops in   X   X   X   whose images in the fundamental group generate the subgroup. This operation generally changes the homology of the space, but these changes can be reversed by the addition of three-cells.  The most common application of the plus construction is in algebraic K-theory. If   R   R   R   is a unital  ring , we denote by    G   L  n    (  R  )       G   subscript  L  n   R    GL_{n}(R)   the group of invertible    n   n   n   -by-   n   n   n    matrices with elements in   R   R   R   .    G   L  n    (  R  )       G   subscript  L  n   R    GL_{n}(R)   embeds in    G   L   n  +  1     (  R  )       G   subscript  L    n  1    R    GL_{n+1}(R)   by attaching a   1   1   1   along the diagonal and   0   0    s elsewhere. The direct limit of these groups via these maps is denoted    G  L   (  R  )       G  L  R    GL(R)   and its classifying space is denoted    B  G  L   (  R  )       B  G  L  R    BGL(R)   . The plus construction may then be applied to the perfect normal subgroup    E   (  R  )       E  R    E(R)   of     G  L   (  R  )    =    π  1    (   B  G  L   (  R  )    )          G  L  R      subscript  π  1     B  G  L  R      GL(R)=\pi_{1}(BGL(R))   , generated by matrices which only differ from the identity matrix in one off-diagonal entry. For    i  >  0      i  0    i>0   , the   n   n   n   th homotopy group of the resulting space,    B  G  L    (  R  )   +       B  G  L   superscript  R      BGL(R)^{+}   is the   n   n   n   th   K   K   K   -group of   R   R   R   ,     K  n    (  R  )        subscript  K  n   R    K_{n}(R)   .
