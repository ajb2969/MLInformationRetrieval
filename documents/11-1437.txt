   Alpha-glucan, water dikinase      Alpha-glucan, water dikinase   In enzymology , an alpha-glucan, water dikinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + alpha-glucan + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + phospho-alpha-glucan + phosphate   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , alpha-glucan , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are AMP , phospho-alpha-glucan , and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with paired acceptors ( dikinases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:alpha-glucan, water phosphotransferase . This enzyme is also called starch-related R1 protein, GWD .
