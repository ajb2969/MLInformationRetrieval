   Approximation property      Approximation property   In mathematics , a Banach space is said to have the approximation property (AP) , if every compact operator is a limit of finite-rank operators . The converse is always true.  Every Hilbert space has this property. There are, however, Banach spaces which do not; Per Enflo published the first counterexample in a 1973 article. However, a lot of work in this area was done by Grothendieck (1955).  Later many other counterexamples were found. The space of bounded operators on    ℓ  2     superscript  normal-ℓ  2    \ell^{2}   does not have the approximation property ( Szankowski ). The spaces    ℓ  p     superscript  normal-ℓ  p    \ell^{p}   for    p  ≠  2      p  2    p\neq 2   and    c  0     subscript  c  0    c_{0}   (see Sequence space ) have closed subspaces that do not have the approximation property.  Definition  A locally convex topological vector space   X   X   X   is said to have the approximation property, if the identity map can be approximated, uniformly on precompact sets , by continuous linear maps of finite rank. 1 If X is a Banach space the this requirement becomes that for every compact set     K  ⊂  X      K  X    K\subset X   and every    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   , there is an operator     T  :   X  →  X      normal-:  T   normal-→  X  X     T\colon X\to X   of finite rank so that     ∥    T  x   -  x   ∥   ≤  ε       norm      T  x   x    ε    \|Tx-x\|\leq\varepsilon   , for every    x  ∈  K      x  K    x\in K   .  Some other flavours of the AP are studied:  Let   X   X   X   be a Banach space and let    1  ≤  λ  <  ∞        1  λ           1\leq\lambda<\infty   . We say that X has the   λ   λ   \lambda    -approximation property (   λ   λ   \lambda    -AP ), if, for every compact set    K  ⊂  X      K  X    K\subset X   and every    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   , there is an operator     T  :   X  →  X      normal-:  T   normal-→  X  X     T\colon X\to X   of finite rank so that     ∥    T  x   -  x   ∥   ≤  ε       norm      T  x   x    ε    \|Tx-x\|\leq\varepsilon   , for every    x  ∈  K      x  K    x\in K   , and     ∥  T  ∥   ≤  λ       norm  T   λ    \|T\|\leq\lambda   .  A Banach space is said to have bounded approximation property ( BAP ), if it has the   λ   λ   \lambda   -AP for some   λ   λ   \lambda   .  A Banach space is said to have metric approximation property ( MAP ), if it is 1-AP.  A Banach space is said to have compact approximation property ( CAP ), if in the definition of AP an operator of finite rank is replaced with a compact operator.  Examples   Every projective limit of Hilbert spaces, as well as any subspace of such a projective limit, possesses the approximation property. 2   Hence every nuclear space possesses the approximation property.   Every subspace of an arbitrary product of Hilbert spaces possesses the approximation property. 3  Every separable Frechet space that contains a Schauder basis possesses the approximation property. 4  Every space with a Schauder basis has the AP (we can use the projections associated to the base as the   T   T   T   's in the definition), thus a lot of spaces with the AP can be found. For example, the     ℓ  p     superscript  normal-ℓ  p    \ell^{p}   spaces , or the symmetric Tsirelson space .
