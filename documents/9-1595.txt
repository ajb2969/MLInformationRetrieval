   Berendsen thermostat      Berendsen thermostat   The Berendsen thermostat 1 is an algorithm to re-scale the velocities of particles in molecular dynamics simulations to control the simulation temperature.  Basic Description  In this scheme, the system is weakly coupled to a heat bath with some temperature. The thermostat suppresses fluctuations of the kinetic energy of the system and therefore cannot produce trajectories consistent with the canonical ensemble . The temperature of the system is corrected such that the deviation exponentially decays with some time constant   τ   τ   \tau   .        d  T    d  t    =     T  0   -  T   τ           d  T     d  t         subscript  T  0   T   τ     \frac{dT}{dt}=\frac{T_{0}-T}{\tau}     Though the thermostat does not generate a correct canonical ensemble (especially for small systems), for large systems on the order of hundreds or thousands of atoms/molecules, the approximation yields roughly correct results for most calculated properties. 2 The scheme is widely used due to the efficiency with which it relaxes a system to some target (bath) temperature. In many instances, systems are initially equilibrated using the Berendsen scheme, while properties are calculated using the widely known Nosé-Hoover thermostat , which correctly generates trajectories consistent with a canonical ensemble.
