Here the sign of the distances is taken negative if and only if the line segment  DX ( X = F , G , H ) lies completely outside the triangle. In the picture DF is negative and both DG and DH are positive.  The theorem is named after Lazare Carnot (1753â€“1823). It is used in a proof of the Japanese theorem for concyclic polygons .
