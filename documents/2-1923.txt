Carnot's theorem

(Figure)




In Euclidean geometry, Carnot's theorem states that the sum of the signed distances from the circumcenter D to the sides of an arbitrary triangle ABC is



where r is the inradius and R is the circumradius of the triangle. Here the sign of the distances is taken negative if and only if the line segment DX (X = F, G, H) lies completely outside the triangle. In the picture DF is negative and both DG and DH are positive.
The theorem is named after Lazare Carnot (1753â€“1823). It is used in a proof of the Japanese theorem for concyclic polygons.
