Observation of the particle allows scientists to explore the Higgs field 3 4 —a fundamental field of crucial importance to particle physics theory, 5 first suspected to exist in the 1960s, that unlike other known fields such as the electromagnetic field , takes a non-zero constant value almost everywhere. For several decades the question of the Higgs Field's existence was the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics and "the central problem in particle physics". 6 7 The presence of this field, now believed to be confirmed, explains why some fundamental particles have mass when, based on the symmetries controlling their interactions, they should be massless. It also solves several other long-standing puzzles, such as the reason for the weak force's extremely short range.  Despite being present everywhere, the existence of the Higgs field is very hard to confirm. It can be detected through its excitations (i.e. Higgs particles), but these are extremely hard to produce and detect. The importance of this fundamental question led to a 40 year search , and the construction of one of the world's most expensive and complex experimental facilities to date, CERN 's Large Hadron Collider , 8 able to create Higgs bosons and other particles for observation and study. On 4 July 2012, the discovery of a new particle with a mass between 125 and  was announced; physicists suspected that it was the Higgs boson.  9 10 By March 2013, the particle had been proven to behave, interact and decay in many of the ways predicted by the Standard Model, and was also tentatively confirmed to have even parity and zero spin , 11 two fundamental attributes of a Higgs boson. This appears to be the first elementary scalar  particle discovered in nature. 12 More data is needed to know if the discovered particle exactly matches the predictions of the Standard Model, or whether, as predicted by some theories, multiple Higgs bosons exist. 13  The Higgs boson is named after Peter Higgs , one of six physicists who, in 1964 , proposed the mechanism that suggested the existence of such a particle. On December 10, 2013 two of these, Peter Higgs and François Englert , were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work and prediction (Englert's co-researcher Robert Brout had died in 2011 and the Nobel Prize is not ordinarily given posthumously ). 14 Although Higgs's name has come to be associated with this theory, several researchers between about 1960 and 1972 each independently developed different parts of it. In mainstream media the Higgs boson has often been called the "God particle", from a 1993 book on the topic ; the nickname is strongly disliked by many physicists, including Higgs, who regard it as inappropriate sensationalism . 15 16 17  In the Standard Model, the Higgs particle is a boson with no spin , electric charge , or colour charge . It is also very unstable, decaying into other particles almost immediately. It is a quantum excitation of one of the four components of the Higgs field. The latter constitutes a scalar  field , with two neutral and two electrically charged components, and forms a complex doublet of the weak isospin  SU(2) symmetry. The Higgs field is tachyonic (this does not refer to faster-than-light speeds, it means that symmetry-breaking through condensation of a particle must occur under certain conditions), and has a " Mexican hat " shaped potential with nonzero strength everywhere (including otherwise empty space), which in its vacuum state breaks the weak isospin symmetry of the electroweak interaction. When this happens, three components of the Higgs field are "absorbed" by the SU(2) and U(1) gauge bosons (the " Higgs mechanism ") to become the longitudinal components of the now-massive  W and Z bosons of the weak force . The remaining electrically neutral component separately couples to other particles known as fermions (via Yukawa couplings ), causing these to acquire mass as well. Some versions of the theory predict more than one kind of Higgs fields and bosons. Alternative "Higgsless" models would have been considered if the Higgs boson was not discovered.  A non-technical summary  "Higgs" terminology        A simple explanation – what are the Higgs mechanism, field and boson?       Symmetries and forces     Higgs mechanism     Higgs field     Higgs boson       Overview  In particle physics , elementary particles and forces give rise to the world around us. Nowadays, physicists explain the behaviour of these particles and how they interact using the Standard Model —a widely accepted and "remarkably" accurate framework based on gauge invariance and symmetries , believed to explain almost everything in the world we see, other than gravity . 18  But by around 1960 all attempts to create a gauge invariant theory for two of the four fundamental forces had consistently failed at one crucial point: although gauge invariance seemed extremely important, it seemed to make any theory of electromagnetism and the weak force go haywire, by demanding that either many particles with mass were massless or that non-existent forces and massless particles had to exist. Scientists had no idea how to get past this point.  In 1962 physicist Philip Anderson wrote a paper that built upon work by Yoichiro Nambu concerning "broken symmetries" in superconductivity and particle physics. He suggested that "broken symmetries" might also be the missing piece needed to solve the problems of gauge invariance. In 1964 a theory was created almost simultaneously by 3 different groups of researchers , that showed Anderson's suggestion was possible - the gauge theory and "mass problems" could indeed be resolved if an unusual kind of field existed throughout the universe; if this kind of field did exist, it would apparently cause existing particles to acquire mass instead of new massless particles being formed. Although these ideas did not gain much initial support or attention, by 1972 it had been developed into a comprehensive theory and proved capable of giving "sensible" results that were extremely accurate, including very accurate predictions of several other particles discovered during the following years . 19 During the 1970s these theories rapidly became the " standard model " favoured by physicists and used to describe particle physics and particle interactions in nature. There was not yet any direct evidence that this field actually existed, but even without proof of the field, the accuracy of its predictions led scientists to believe the theory might be true. By the 1980s the question whether or not such a field existed and whether this was the correct explanation, was considered to be one of the most important unanswered questions in particle physics, and by the 1990s two of the largest experimental installations ever created were being designed and constructed to find the answer.  If this new kind of field did exist in nature, it would be a monumental discovery for science and human knowledge, and would open doorways to new knowledge in many disciplines. If not, then other more complicated theories would need to be explored. The simplest solution to whether the field existed was by searching for a new kind of particle it would have to give off, known as "Higgs bosons" or the "Higgs particle". These would be extremely difficult to find, so it was only many years later that experimental technology became sophisticated enough to answer the question.  While several symmetries in nature are spontaneously broken through a form of the Higgs mechanism, in the context of the Standard Model the term " Higgs mechanism " almost always means symmetry breaking of the electroweak field . It is considered confirmed, but revealing the exact cause has been difficult .  Various analogies have also been invented to describe the Higgs field and boson, including analogies with well-known symmetry breaking effects such as the rainbow and prism , electric fields , ripples, and resistance of macro objects moving through media, like people moving through crowds or some objects moving through syrup or molasses . However, analogies based on simple resistance to motion are inaccurate as the Higgs field does not work by resisting motion.  Significance  Scientific impact  Evidence of the Higgs field and its properties has been extremely significant scientifically, for many reasons. The Higgs boson's importance is largely that it is able to be examined using existing knowledge and experimental technology, as a way to confirm and study the entire Higgs field theory. 20 21 Conversely, proof that the Higgs field and boson do not exist would also have been significant. In discussion form, the relevance includes:      Validating the Standard Model , or choosing between extensions and alternatives   Does the Higgs field exist, which fundamentally validates the Standard Model through the mechanism of Mass generation ? If it does, then which more advanced extensions are suggested or excluded based upon measurements of its properties? What else can we learn about this fundamental field, now that we have the experimental means to study its behavior and interactions? Alternatively, if the Higgs field doesn't exist, which alternatives and modifications to the Standard Model are likely to be preferred? Will the data suggest an extension, or a completely different approach (such as supersymmetry or string theory )? Related to this, a belief generally exists among physicists that there is likely to be "new" physics beyond the Standard Model —the Standard Model will at some point be extended or superseded. The Higgs field and related issues present a promising "doorway" to understand better the places where the Standard Model might become inadequate or fail, and could provide considerable evidence guiding researchers into future enhancements or successors.     Finding how symmetry breaking happens within the electroweak interaction   Below an extremely high temperature, electroweak symmetry breaking causes the electroweak interaction to manifest in part as the short-ranged weak force , which is carried by massive gauge bosons . Without this, the universe we see around us could not exist, because atoms and other structures could not form, and reactions in stars such as our Sun would not occur. But it is not clear how this actually happens in nature. Is the Standard Model correct in its approach, and can it be made more exact with actual experimental measurements? If not the Higgs field, then what is breaking symmetry in its place?     Finding how certain particles acquire mass   Electroweak symmetry breaking (due to a Higgs field or otherwise) is believed proven responsible for the masses of fundamental particles such as elementary fermions (including electrons and quarks ) and the massive W and Z  gauge bosons . Finding how this happens is pivotal to particle physics. It is worth noting that the Higgs field does not 'create' mass out of nothing (which would violate the law of conservation of energy ). Nor is the Higgs field responsible for the mass of all particles. For example, about 99% of the mass of baryons (composite particles such as the proton and neutron ) is due instead to the kinetic energy of quarks and to the energies of (massless) gluons of the strong interaction inside the baryons. {{cite web     Evidence whether or not scalar fields exist in nature, and "new" physics   Proof of a scalar field such as the Higgs field would be hard to overestimate: "[The] verification of real scalar fields would be nearly as important as its role in generating mass".  22  Rolf-Dieter Heuer , director general of CERN, stated in a 2011 talk on the Higgs field: 23   "All the matter particles are spin-1/2 fermions . All the force carriers are spin-1 bosons. Higgs particles are spin-0 bosons (scalars). The Higgs is neither matter nor force. The Higgs is just different. This would be the first fundamental scalar ever discovered. The Higgs field is thought to fill the entire universe. Could it give some handle of dark energy (scalar field)? Many modern theories predict other scalar particles like the Higgs. Why, after all, should the Higgs be the only one of its kind? [The] LHC can search for and study new scalars with precision."      Insight into cosmic inflation   There has been considerable scientific research on possible links between the Higgs field and the inflaton – a hypothetical field suggested as the explanation for the expansion of space during the first fraction of a second of the universe (known as the " inflationary epoch "). Some theories suggest that a fundamental scalar field might be responsible for this phenomenon; the Higgs field is such a field and therefore has led to papers analysing whether it could also be the inflaton responsible for this exponential expansion of the universe during the Big Bang . Such theories are highly tentative and face significant problems related to unitarity , but may be viable if combined with additional features such as large non-minimal coupling, a Brans–Dicke scalar, or other "new" physics, and have received treatments suggesting that Higgs inflation models are still of interest theoretically.     Insight into the nature of the universe , and its possible fates     (Figure)  Higgs-Mass-MetaStability.svg    Diagram showing the Higgs boson and top quark masses, which could indicate whether our universe is stable, or a long-lived 'bubble' . As of 2012, the 2σ ellipse based on Tevatron and LHC data still allows for both possibilities. 24     For decades, scientific models of our universe have included the possibility that it exists as a long-lived, but not completely stable , sector of space, which could potentially at some time be destroyed upon ' toppling ' into a more stable vacuum state . 25 26 27 28 29 If the masses of the Higgs boson and top quark are known more exactly, and the Standard Model provides a correct description of particle physics up to extreme energies of the Planck scale , then it is possible to calculate whether the universe's present vacuum state is stable or merely long-lived. 30 31 32 (This was sometimes misreported as the Higgs boson "ending" the universe ). A  Higgs mass seems to be extremely close to the boundary for stability (estimated in 2012 as 33 ) but a definitive answer requires much more precise measurements of the top quark's pole mass . 34 New physics can change this picture. 35  If measurements of the Higgs boson suggest that our universe lies within a false vacuum of this kind, then it would imply – more than likely in many billions of years 36 – that the universe's forces, particles, and structures could cease to exist as we know them (and be replaced by different ones), if a true vacuum happened to nucleate . 37 38 It also suggests that the Higgs self-coupling λ and its β λ function could be very close to zero at the Planck scale, with "intriguing" implications, including theories of gravity and Higgs-based inflation. 39 40 41 A future electron–positron collider would be able to provide the precise measurements of the top quark needed for such calculations. 42     Insight into the 'energy of the vacuum'   More speculatively, the Higgs field has also been proposed as the energy of the vacuum , which at the extreme energies of the first moments of the Big Bang caused the universe to be a kind of featureless symmetry of undifferentiated extremely high energy. In this kind of speculation, the single unified field of a Grand Unified Theory is identified as (or modeled upon) the Higgs field, and it is through successive symmetry breakings of the Higgs field or some similar field at phase transitions that the present universe's known forces and fields arise. 43     Link to the 'cosmological constant' problem   The relationship (if any) between the Higgs field and the presently observed vacuum energy density of the universe has also come under scientific study. As observed, the present vacuum energy density is extremely close to zero, but the energy density expected from the Higgs field, supersymmetry, and other current theories are typically many orders of magnitude larger. It is unclear how these should be reconciled. This cosmological constant problem remains a further major unanswered problem in physics.     "Real world" impact  As yet, there are no known immediate technological benefits of finding the Higgs particle. However, a common pattern for fundamental discoveries is for practical applications to follow later, once the discovery has been explored further, at which point they become the basis for social change and new technologies. 44 45 46  Other observers  have highlighted that the challenges in particle physics have furthered major technological and in turn sociological developments. For example, the World Wide Web began as a project to improve CERN's communication system. Another example is the contribution to the fields of distributed and cloud computing due to CERN's requirement to process massive amounts of data produced by the Large Hadron Collider .  History      The six authors of the 1964 PRL papers , who received the 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for their work. From left to right: Kibble , Guralnik , Hagen , Englert , Brout . Right:  Higgs .     Particle physicists study matter made from fundamental particles whose interactions are mediated by exchange particles - gauge bosons - acting as force carriers . At the beginning of the 1960s a number of these particles had been discovered or proposed, along with theories suggesting how they relate to each other, some of which had already been reformulated as field theories in which the objects of study are not particles and forces, but quantum fields and their symmetries . 47 However, attempts to unify known fundamental forces such as the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force were known to be incomplete. One known omission was that gauge invariant approaches, including non-abelian models such as Yang–Mills theory (1954), which held great promise for unified theories, also seemed to predict known massive particles as massless. 48  Goldstone's theorem , relating to continuous symmetries within some theories, also appeared to rule out many obvious solutions, 49 since it appeared to show that zero-mass particles would have to also exist that were "simply not seen". 50 According to Guralnik , physicists had "no understanding" how these problems could be overcome. 51  Particle physicist and mathematician Peter Woit summarised the state of research at the time:   "Yang and Mills work on non-abelian gauge theory had one huge problem: in perturbation theory it has massless particles which don’t correspond to anything we see. One way of getting rid of this problem is now fairly well-understood, the phenomenon of confinement realized in QCD , where the strong interactions get rid of the massless “gluon” states at long distances. By the very early sixties, people had begun to understand another source of massless particles: spontaneous symmetry breaking of a continuous symmetry. What Philip Anderson realized and worked out in the summer of 1962 was that, when you have both gauge symmetry and spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Nambu–Goldstone massless mode can combine with the massless gauge field modes to produce a physical massive vector field. This is what happens in superconductivity , a subject about which Anderson was (and is) one of the leading experts." [text condensed]  52    The Higgs mechanism is a process by which vector bosons can get rest mass  without  explicitly breaking  gauge invariance , as a byproduct of spontaneous symmetry breaking . 53 54 The mathematical theory behind spontaneous symmetry breaking was initially conceived and published within particle physics by Yoichiro Nambu in 1960, 55 the concept that such a mechanism could offer a possible solution for the "mass problem" was originally suggested in 1962 by Philip Anderson (who had previously written papers on broken symmetry and its outcomes in superconductivity 56 and concluded in his 1963 paper on Yang-Mills theory that "considering the superconducting analog... [t]hese two types of bosons seem capable of canceling each other out... leaving finite mass bosons" ), 57 58 and Abraham Klein and Benjamin Lee showed in March 1964 that Goldstone's theorem could be avoided this way in at least some non-relativistic cases and speculated it might be possible in truly relativistic cases. 59  These approaches were quickly developed into a full relativistic model, independently and almost simultaneously, by three groups of physicists: by François Englert and Robert Brout in August 1964; 60 by Peter Higgs in October 1964; 61 and by Gerald Guralnik , Carl Hagen , and Tom Kibble (GHK) in November 1964. 62 Higgs also wrote a short but important 63 response published in September 1964 to an objection by Gilbert , 64 which showed that if calculating within the radiation gauge, Goldstone's theorem and Gilbert's objection would become inapplicable. 65 (Higgs later described Gilbert's objection as prompting his own paper. 66 ) Properties of the model were further considered by Guralnik in 1965, 67 by Higgs in 1966, 68 by Kibble in 1967, 69 and further by GHK in 1967. 70 The original three 1964 papers showed that when a gauge theory is combined with an additional field that spontaneously breaks the symmetry, the gauge bosons can consistently acquire a finite mass. 71 72 73 In 1967, Steven Weinberg 74 and Abdus Salam 75 independently showed how a Higgs mechanism could be used to break the electroweak symmetry of Sheldon Glashow 's unified model for the weak and electromagnetic interactions 76 (itself an extension of work by Schwinger ), forming what became the Standard Model of particle physics. Weinberg was the first to observe that this would also provide mass terms for the fermions. 77   However, the seminal papers on spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetries were at first largely ignored, because it was widely believed that the (non-Abelian gauge) theories in question were a dead-end, and in particular that they could not be renormalised . In 1971–72, Martinus Veltman and Gerard 't Hooft proved renormalisation of Yang–Mills was possible in two papers covering massless, and then massive, fields. 78 Their contribution, and others' work on the renormalization group - including "substantial" theoretical work by Russian physicists  Ludvig Faddeev , Andrei Slavnov , Efim Fradkin and Igor Tyutin 79 - was eventually "enormously profound and influential", 80 but even with all key elements of the eventual theory published there was still almost no wider interest. For example, Coleman found in a study that "essentially no-one paid any attention" to Weinberg's paper prior to 1971 81 and discussed by David Politzer in his 2004 Nobel speech. 82 – now the most cited in particle physics 83 – and even in 1970 according to Politzer , Glashow's teaching of the weak interaction contained no mention of Weinberg's, Salam's, or Glashow's own work. 84 In practice, Politzer states, almost everyone learned of the theory due to physicist Benjamin Lee , who combined the work of Veltman and 't Hooft with insights by others, and popularised the completed theory. 85 In this way, from 1971, interest and acceptance "exploded" 86 and the ideas were quickly absorbed in the mainstream. 87 88  The resulting electroweak theory and Standard Model have correctly predicted (among other discoveries) weak neutral currents , three bosons , the top and charm quarks , and with great precision, the mass and other properties of some of these. 89 Many of those involved eventually won  Nobel Prizes or other renowned awards. A 1974 paper and comprehensive review in Reviews of Modern Physics commented that "while no one doubted the [mathematical] correctness of these arguments, no one quite believed that nature was diabolically clever enough to take advantage of them", 90 adding that the theory had so far produced meaningful answers that accorded with experiment, but it was unknown whether the theory was actually correct. 91 By 1986 and again in the 1990s it became possible to write that understanding and proving the Higgs sector of the Standard Model was "the central problem today in particle physics". 92 93  Summary and impact of the PRL papers  The three papers written in 1964 were each recognised as milestone papers during Physical Review Letters {{'s}} 50th anniversary celebration. 94 Their six authors were also awarded the 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics for this work. 95 (A controversy also arose the same year, because in the event of a Nobel Prize only up to three scientists could be recognised, with six being credited for the papers. 96 ) Two of the three PRL papers (by Higgs and by GHK) contained equations for the hypothetical field that eventually would become known as the Higgs field and its hypothetical quantum , the Higgs boson. 97 98 Higgs' subsequent 1966 paper showed the decay mechanism of the boson; only a massive boson can decay and the decays can prove the mechanism.  In the paper by Higgs the boson is massive, and in a closing sentence Higgs writes that "an essential feature" of the theory "is the prediction of incomplete multiplets of scalar and vector bosons ". 99 ( Frank Close comments that 1960s gauge theorists were focused on the problem of massless vector bosons, and the implied existence of a massive scalar boson was not seen as important; only Higgs directly addressed it. 100 ) In the paper by GHK the boson is massless and decoupled from the massive states. 101 In reviews dated 2009 and 2011, Guralnik states that in the GHK model the boson is massless only in a lowest-order approximation, but it is not subject to any constraint and acquires mass at higher orders, and adds that the GHK paper was the only one to show that there are no massless Goldstone bosons in the model and to give a complete analysis of the general Higgs mechanism. 102 103 All three reached similar conclusions, despite their very different approaches: Higgs' paper essentially used classical techniques, Englert and Brout's involved calculating vacuum polarization in perturbation theory around an assumed symmetry-breaking vacuum state, and GHK used operator formalism and conservation laws to explore in depth the ways in which Goldstone's theorem may be worked around. 104  Theoretical properties  Theoretical need for the Higgs   Gauge invariance is an important property of modern particle theories such as the Standard Model , partly due to its success in other areas of fundamental physics such as electromagnetism and the strong interaction ( quantum chromodynamics ). However, there were great difficulties in developing gauge theories for the weak nuclear force or a possible unified electroweak interaction . Fermions with a mass term would violate gauge symmetry and therefore cannot be gauge invariant. (This can be seen by examining the Dirac Lagrangian for a fermion in terms of left and right handed components; we find none of the spin-half particles could ever flip helicity as required for mass, so they must be massless. In the Standard Model, the mass term arising from the Dirac Lagrangian for any fermion   ψ   ψ   \psi   is    -   m   ψ  ¯   ψ         m   normal-¯  ψ   ψ     -m\bar{\psi}\psi   . This is not invariant under the electroweak symmetry, as can be seen by writing   ψ   ψ   \psi   in terms of left and right handed components:       -   m   ψ  ¯    ψ     =   -   m   (      ψ  ¯   L    ψ  R    +     ψ  ¯   R    ψ  L     )             m   normal-¯  ψ   ψ        m       subscript   normal-¯  ψ   L    subscript  ψ  R       subscript   normal-¯  ψ   R    subscript  ψ  L         -m\bar{\psi}\psi\;=\;-m(\bar{\psi}_{L}\psi_{R}+\bar{\psi}_{R}\psi_{L})   i.e., contributions from      ψ  ¯   L    ψ  L        subscript   normal-¯  ψ   L    subscript  ψ  L     \bar{\psi}_{L}\psi_{L}   and      ψ  ¯   R    ψ  R        subscript   normal-¯  ψ   R    subscript  ψ  R     \bar{\psi}_{R}\psi_{R}   terms do not appear. We see that the mass-generating interaction is achieved by constant flipping of particle chirality . Since the spin-half particles have no right/left helicity pair with the same SU(2) and SU(3) representation and the same weak hypercharge, then assuming these gauge charges are conserved in the vacuum, none of the spin-half particles could ever swap helicity. Therefore, in the absence of some other cause, all fermions must be massless.) W and Z bosons are observed to have mass, but a boson mass term contains terms, which clearly depend on the choice of gauge and therefore these masses too cannot be gauge invariant. Therefore, it seems that none of the standard model fermions or bosons could "begin" with mass as an inbuilt property except by abandoning gauge invariance. If gauge invariance were to be retained, then these particles had to be acquiring their mass by some other mechanism or interaction. Additionally, whatever was giving these particles their mass, had to not "break" gauge invariance as the basis for other parts of the theories where it worked well, and had to not require or predict unexpected massless particles and long-range forces (seemingly an inevitable consequence of Goldstone's theorem ) which did not actually seem to exist in nature.  A solution to all of these overlapping problems came from the discovery of a previously unnoticed borderline case hidden in the mathematics of Goldstone's theorem, Goldstone's theorem only applies to gauges having manifest Lorentz covariance , a condition that took time to become questioned. But the process of quantisation requires a gauge to be fixed and at this point it becomes possible to choose a gauge such as the 'radiation' gauge which is not invariant over time, so that these problems can be avoided. According to Bernstein (1974, p.8):   "the "radiation gauge" condition  is clearly noncovariant, which means that if we wish to maintain transversality of the photon in all Lorentz frames , the photon field A μ ( x ) cannot transform like a four-vector . This is no catastrophe, since the photon field is not an observable , and one can readily show that the S-matrix elements, which are observable have covariant structures .... in gauge theories one might arrange things so that one had a symmetry breakdown because of the noninvariance of the vacuum; but, because the Goldstone et al. proof breaks down, the zero mass Goldstone mesons need not appear." [Emphasis in original]   Bernstein (1974) contains an accessible and comprehensive background and review of this area, see external links that under certain conditions it might theoretically be possible for a symmetry to be broken without disrupting gauge invariance and without any new massless particles or forces, and having "sensible" ( renormalisable ) results mathematically: this became known as the Higgs mechanism .  The Standard Model hypothesizes a field which is responsible for this effect, called the Higgs field (symbol   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   ), which has the unusual property of a non-zero amplitude in its ground state ; i.e., a non-zero vacuum expectation value . It can have this effect because of its unusual "Mexican hat" shaped potential whose lowest "point" is not at its "centre". Below a certain extremely high energy level the existence of this non-zero vacuum expectation spontaneously breaks  electroweak  gauge symmetry which in turn gives rise to the Higgs mechanism and triggers the acquisition of mass by those particles interacting with the field. This effect occurs because scalar field components of the Higgs field are "absorbed" by the massive bosons as degrees of freedom , and couple to the fermions via Yukawa coupling , thereby producing the expected mass terms. In effect when symmetry breaks under these conditions, the Goldstone bosons that arise interact with the Higgs field (and with other particles capable of interacting with the Higgs field) instead of becoming new massless particles, the intractable problems of both underlying theories "neutralise" each other, and the residual outcome is that elementary particles acquire a consistent mass based on how strongly they interact with the Higgs field. It is the simplest known process capable of giving mass to the gauge bosons while remaining compatible with gauge theories . 105 Its quantum would be a scalar  boson , known as the Higgs boson. 106  (Figure)  Summary of interactions between certain particles described by the Standard Model .   Properties of the Higgs field  In the Standard Model, the Higgs field is a scalar  tachyonic field – 'scalar' meaning it does not transform under Lorentz transformations , and 'tachyonic' meaning the field (but not the particle) has imaginary mass and in certain configurations must undergo symmetry breaking . It consists of four components, two neutral ones and two charged component fields . Both of the charged components and one of the neutral fields are Goldstone bosons , which act as the longitudinal third-polarization components of the massive W + , W − , and Z bosons . The quantum of the remaining neutral component corresponds to (and is theoretically realised as) the massive Higgs boson, 107 this component can interact with fermions via Yukawa coupling to give them mass, as well.  Mathematically, the Higgs field has imaginary mass and is therefore a tachyonic field . 108 While tachyons ( particles that move faster than light ) are a purely hypothetical concept, fields with imaginary mass have come to play an important role in modern physics. 109 110 Under no circumstances do any excitations ever propagate faster than light in such theories — the presence or absence of a tachyonic mass has no effect whatsoever on the maximum velocity of signals (there is no violation of causality ). 111 Instead of faster-than-light particles, the imaginary mass creates an instability:- any configuration in which one or more field excitations are tachyonic must spontaneously decay, and the resulting configuration contains no physical tachyons. This process is known as tachyon condensation , and is now believed to be the explanation for how the Higgs mechanism itself arises in nature, and therefore the reason behind electroweak symmetry breaking.  Although the notion of imaginary mass might seem troubling, it is only the field, and not the mass itself, that is quantized. Therefore, the field operators at spacelike separated points still commute (or anticommute) , and information and particles still do not propagate faster than light. 112  Tachyon condensation drives a physical system that has reached a local limit and might naively be expected to produce physical tachyons, to an alternate stable state where no physical tachyons exist. Once a tachyonic field such as the Higgs field reaches the minimum of the potential, its quanta are not tachyons any more but rather are ordinary particles such as the Higgs boson. 113  Properties of the Higgs boson  Since the Higgs field is scalar , the Higgs boson has no spin . The Higgs boson is also its own antiparticle and is CP-even , and has zero electric and colour charge . 114  The Minimal Standard Model does not predict the mass of the Higgs boson. 115 If that mass is between 115 and , then the Standard Model can be valid at energy scales all the way up to the Planck scale (10 19 GeV). 116 Many theorists expect new physics beyond the Standard Model to emerge at the TeV-scale, based on unsatisfactory properties of the Standard Model. 117 The highest possible mass scale allowed for the Higgs boson (or some other electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism) is 1.4 TeV; beyond this point, the Standard Model becomes inconsistent without such a mechanism, because unitarity is violated in certain scattering processes. 118  It is also possible, although experimentally difficult, to estimate the mass of the Higgs boson indirectly. In the Standard Model, the Higgs boson has a number of indirect effects; most notably, Higgs loops result in tiny corrections to masses of W and Z bosons. Precision measurements of electroweak parameters, such as the Fermi constant and masses of W/Z bosons, can be used to calculate constraints on the mass of the Higgs. As of July 2011, the precision electroweak measurements tell us that the mass of the Higgs boson is likely to be less than about  at 95% confidence level (this upper limit would increase to  if the lower bound of  from the LEP-2 direct search is allowed for 119 ). These indirect constraints rely on the assumption that the Standard Model is correct. It may still be possible to discover a Higgs boson above these masses if it is accompanied by other particles beyond those predicted by the Standard Model. 120  Production      Feynman diagrams for Higgs production     frameless|upright=.7|Gluon fusion  Gluon fusion     frameless|upright=.7|Vector boson fusion  Vector boson fusion     If Higgs particle theories are correct, then a Higgs particle can be produced much like other particles that are studied, in a particle collider . This involves accelerating a large number of particles to extremely high energies and extremely close to the speed of light , then allowing them to smash together. Protons and lead  ions (the bare nuclei of lead atoms ) are used at the LHC. In the extreme energies of these collisions, the desired esoteric particles will occasionally be produced and this can be detected and studied; any absence or difference from theoretical expectations can also be used to improve the theory. The relevant particle theory (in this case the Standard Model) will determine the necessary kinds of collisions and detectors. The Standard Model predicts that Higgs bosons could be formed in a number of ways, 121 122 123 although the probability of producing a Higgs boson in any collision is always expected to be very small—for example, only 1 Higgs boson per 10 billion collisions in the Large Hadron Collider. The most common expected processes for Higgs boson production are:   Gluon fusion . If the collided particles are hadrons such as the proton or antiproton —as is the case in the LHC and Tevatron—then it is most likely that two of the gluons binding the hadron together collide. The easiest way to produce a Higgs particle is if the two gluons combine to form a loop of virtual quarks. Since the coupling of particles to the Higgs boson is proportional to their mass, this process is more likely for heavy particles. In practice it is enough to consider the contributions of virtual top and bottom quarks (the heaviest quarks). This process is the dominant contribution at the LHC and Tevatron being about ten times more likely than any of the other processes. 124 125  Higgs Strahlung . If an elementary fermion collides with an anti-fermion—e.g., a quark with an anti-quark or an electron with a positron —the two can merge to form a virtual W or Z boson which, if it carries sufficient energy, can then emit a Higgs boson. This process was the dominant production mode at the LEP, where an electron and a positron collided to form a virtual Z boson, and it was the second largest contribution for Higgs production at the Tevatron. At the LHC this process is only the third largest, because the LHC collides protons with protons, making a quark-antiquark collision less likely than at the Tevatron. Higgs Strahlung is also known as associated production . 126 127 128  Weak boson fusion . Another possibility when two (anti-)fermions collide is that the two exchange a virtual W or Z boson, which emits a Higgs boson. The colliding fermions do not need to be the same type. So, for example, an up quark may exchange a Z boson with an anti-down quark. This process is the second most important for the production of Higgs particle at the LHC and LEP. 129 130  Top fusion . The final process that is commonly considered is by far the least likely (by two orders of magnitude). This process involves two colliding gluons, which each decay into a heavy quark–antiquark pair. A quark and antiquark from each pair can then combine to form a Higgs particle. 131 132   Decay  thumb|upright=1.3|The Standard Model prediction for the decay width of the Higgs particle depends on the value of its mass. Quantum mechanics predicts that if it is possible for a particle to decay into a set of lighter particles, then it will eventually do so. 133 This is also true for the Higgs boson. The likelihood with which this happens depends on a variety of factors including: the difference in mass, the strength of the interactions, etc. Most of these factors are fixed by the Standard Model, except for the mass of the Higgs boson itself. For a Higgs boson with a mass of  the SM predicts a mean life time of about .  thumb|upright=1.3|The Standard Model prediction for the branching ratios of the different decay modes of the Higgs particle depends on the value of its mass. Since it interacts with all the massive elementary particles of the SM, the Higgs boson has many different processes through which it can decay. Each of these possible processes has its own probability, expressed as the branching ratio ; the fraction of the total number decays that follows that process. The SM predicts these branching ratios as a function of the Higgs mass (see plot).  One way that the Higgs can decay is by splitting into a fermion–antifermion pair. As general rule, the Higgs is more likely to decay into heavy fermions than light fermions, because the mass of a fermion is proportional to the strength of its interaction with the Higgs. 134 By this logic the most common decay should be into a top –antitop quark pair. However, such a decay is only possible if the Higgs is heavier than ~, twice the mass of the top quark. For a Higgs mass of  the SM predicts that the most common decay is into a bottom –antibottom quark pair, which happens 56.1% of the time. 135 The second most common fermion decay at that mass is a tau –antitau pair, which happens only about 6% of the time. 136  Another possibility is for the Higgs to split into a pair of massive gauge bosons. The most likely possibility is for the Higgs to decay into a pair of W bosons (the light blue line in the plot), which happens about 23.1% of the time for a Higgs boson with a mass of . 137 The W bosons can subsequently decay either into a quark and an antiquark or into a charged lepton and a neutrino. However, the decays of W bosons into quarks are difficult to distinguish from the background, and the decays into leptons cannot be fully reconstructed (because neutrinos are impossible to detect in particle collision experiments). A cleaner signal is given by decay into a pair of Z-bosons (which happens about 2.9% of the time for a Higgs with a mass of ), 138 if each of the bosons subsequently decays into a pair of easy-to-detect charged leptons ( electrons or muons ).  Decay into massless gauge bosons (i.e., gluons or photons ) is also possible, but requires intermediate loop of virtual heavy quarks (top or bottom) or massive gauge bosons. 139 The most common such process is the decay into a pair of gluons through a loop of virtual heavy quarks. This process, which is the reverse of the gluon fusion process mentioned above, happens approximately 8.5% of the time for a Higgs boson with a mass of . 140 Much rarer is the decay into a pair of photons mediated by a loop of W bosons or heavy quarks, which happens only twice for every thousand decays. 141 However, this process is very relevant for experimental searches for the Higgs boson, because the energy and momentum of the photons can be measured very precisely, giving an accurate reconstruction of the mass of the decaying particle. 142  Alternative models  The Minimal Standard Model as described above is the simplest known model for the Higgs mechanism with just one Higgs field. However, an extended Higgs sector with additional Higgs particle doublets or triplets is also possible, and many extensions of the Standard Model have this feature. The non-minimal Higgs sector favoured by theory are the two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM), which predict the existence of a quintet of scalar particles: two CP-even neutral Higgs bosons h 0 and H 0 , a CP-odd neutral Higgs boson A 0 , and two charged Higgs particles H ± . Supersymmetry ("SUSY") also predicts relations between the Higgs-boson masses and the masses of the gauge bosons, and could accommodate a  neutral Higgs boson.  The key method to distinguish between these different models involves study of the particles' interactions ("coupling") and exact decay processes ("branching ratios"), which can be measured and tested experimentally in particle collisions. In the Type-I 2HDM model one Higgs doublet couples to up and down quarks, while the second doublet does not couple to quarks. This model has two interesting limits, in which the lightest Higgs couples to just fermions ("gauge- phobic ") or just gauge bosons ("fermiophobic"), but not both. In the Type-II 2HDM model, one Higgs doublet only couples to up-type quarks, the other only couples to down-type quarks. 143 The heavily researched Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) includes a Type-II 2HDM Higgs sector, so it could be disproven by evidence of a Type-I 2HDM Higgs.  In other models the Higgs scalar is a composite particle. For example, in technicolor the role of the Higgs field is played by strongly bound pairs of fermions called techniquarks . Other models, feature pairs of top quarks (see top quark condensate ). In yet other models, there is no Higgs field at all and the electroweak symmetry is broken using extra dimensions. 144 145  (Figure)  A one-loop Feynman diagram of the first-order correction to the Higgs mass. In the Standard Model the effects of these corrections are potentially enormous, giving rise to the so-called hierarchy problem .   Further theoretical issues and hierarchy problem  The Standard Model leaves the mass of the Higgs boson as a parameter to be measured, rather than a value to be calculated. This is seen as theoretically unsatisfactory, particularly as quantum corrections (related to interactions with virtual particles ) should apparently cause the Higgs particle to have a mass immensely higher than that observed, but at the same time the Standard Model requires a mass of the order of 100 to 1000 GeV to ensure unitarity (in this case, to unitarise longitudinal vector boson scattering). 146 Reconciling these points appears to require explaining why there is an almost-perfect cancellation resulting in the visible mass of ~ 125 GeV, and it is not clear how to do this. Because the weak force is about 10 32 times stronger than gravity, and (linked to this) the Higgs boson's mass is so much less than the Planck mass or the grand unification energy , it appears that either there is some underlying connection or reason for these observations which is unknown and not described by the Standard Model, or some unexplained and extremely precise fine-tuning of parameters – however at present neither of these explanations is proven. This is known as a hierarchy problem . 147 More broadly, the hierarchy problem amounts to the worry that a future theory of fundamental particles and interactions should not have excessive fine-tunings or unduly delicate cancellations, and should allow masses of particles such as the Higgs boson to be calculable. The problem is in some ways unique to spin-0 particles (such as the Higgs boson), which can give rise to issues related to quantum corrections that do not affect particles with spin. 148 A number of solutions have been proposed , including supersymmetry , conformal solutions and solutions via extra dimensions such as braneworld models.  There are also issues of quantum triviality , which suggests that it may not be possible to create a consistent quantum field theory involving elementary scalar particles.  Experimental search  To produce Higgs bosons , two beams of particles are accelerated to very high energies and allowed to collide within a particle detector . Occasionally, although rarely, a Higgs boson will be created fleetingly as part of the collision byproducts. Because the Higgs boson decays very quickly, particle detectors cannot detect it directly. Instead the detectors register all the decay products (the decay signature ) and from the data the decay process is reconstructed. If the observed decay products match a possible decay process (known as a decay channel ) of a Higgs boson, this indicates that a Higgs boson may have been created. In practice, many processes may produce similar decay signatures. Fortunately, the Standard Model precisely predicts the likelihood of each of these, and each known process, occurring. So, if the detector detects more decay signatures consistently matching a Higgs boson than would otherwise be expected if Higgs bosons did not exist, then this would be strong evidence that the Higgs boson exists.  Because Higgs boson production in a particle collision is likely to be very rare (1 in 10 billion at the LHC),{{#tag:ref|The example is based on the production rate at the LHC operating at 7 TeV. The total cross-section for producing a Higgs boson at the LHC is about 10 picobarn , 149 while the total cross-section for a proton–proton collision is 110 millibarn . 150 |name="production_rate"|group="Note"}} and many other possible collision events can have similar decay signatures, the data of hundreds of trillions of collisions needs to be analysed and must "show the same picture" before a conclusion about the existence of the Higgs boson can be reached. To conclude that a new particle has been found, particle physicists require that the statistical analysis of two independent particle detectors each indicate that there is lesser than a one-in-a-million chance that the observed decay signatures are due to just background random Standard Model events—i.e., that the observed number of events is more than 5 standard deviations (sigma) different from that expected if there was no new particle. More collision data allows better confirmation of the physical properties of any new particle observed, and allows physicists to decide whether it is indeed a Higgs boson as described by the Standard Model or some other hypothetical new particle.  To find the Higgs boson, a powerful particle accelerator was needed, because Higgs bosons might not be seen in lower-energy experiments. The collider needed to have a high luminosity in order to ensure enough collisions were seen for conclusions to be drawn. Finally, advanced computing facilities were needed to process the vast amount of data (25 petabytes per year as at 2012) produced by the collisions. 151 For the announcement of 4 July 2012, a new collider known as the Large Hadron Collider was constructed at CERN with a planned eventual collision energy of 14 TeV —over seven times any previous collider—and over 300 trillion (3×10 14 ) LHC proton–proton collisions were analysed by the LHC Computing Grid , the world's largest computing grid (as of 2012), comprising over 170 computing facilities in a worldwide network across 36 countries. 152 153 154  Search prior to 4 July 2012  The first extensive search for the Higgs boson was conducted at the Large Electron–Positron Collider (LEP) at CERN in the 1990s. At the end of its service in 2000, LEP had found no conclusive evidence for the Higgs. 155 This implied that if the Higgs boson were to exist it would have to be heavier than . 156  The search continued at Fermilab in the United States, where the Tevatron —the collider that discovered the top quark in 1995—had been upgraded for this purpose. There was no guarantee that the Tevatron would be able to find the Higgs, but it was the only supercollider that was operational since the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was still under construction and the planned Superconducting Super Collider had been cancelled in 1993 and never completed. The Tevatron was only able to exclude further ranges for the Higgs mass, and was shut down on 30 September 2011 because it no longer could keep up with the LHC. The final analysis of the data excluded the possibility of a Higgs boson with a mass between  and . In addition, there was a small (but not significant) excess of events possibly indicating a Higgs boson with a mass between  and . 157  The Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland , was designed specifically to be able to either confirm or exclude the existence of the Higgs boson. Built in a 27 km tunnel under the ground near Geneva originally inhabited by LEP, it was designed to collide two beams of protons, initially at energies of  per beam (7 TeV total), or almost 3.6 times that of the Tevatron, and upgradeable to  (14 TeV total) in future. Theory suggested if the Higgs boson existed, collisions at these energy levels should be able to reveal it. As one of the most complicated scientific instruments ever built, its operational readiness was delayed for 14 months by a magnet quench event nine days after its inaugural tests, caused by a faulty electrical connection that damaged over 50 superconducting magnets and contaminated the vacuum system. 158 159 160  Data collection at the LHC finally commenced in March 2010. 161 By December 2011 the two main particle detectors at the LHC, ATLAS and CMS , had narrowed down the mass range where the Higgs could exist to around 116-130 GeV (ATLAS) and 115-127 GeV (CMS). 162 163 There had also already been a number of promising event excesses that had "evaporated" and proven to be nothing but random fluctuations. However, from around May 2011, 164 both experiments had seen among their results, the slow emergence of a small yet consistent excess of gamma and 4-lepton decay signatures and several other particle decays, all hinting at a new particle at a mass around . 165 By around November 2011, the anomalous data at 125 GeV was becoming "too large to ignore" (although still far from conclusive), and the team leaders at both ATLAS and CMS each privately suspected they might have found the Higgs. 166 On November 28, 2011, at an internal meeting of the two team leaders and the director general of CERN, the latest analyses were discussed outside their teams for the first time, suggesting both ATLAS and CMS might be converging on a possible shared result at 125 GeV, and initial preparations commenced in case of a successful finding. 167 While this information was not known publicly at the time, the narrowing of the possible Higgs range to around 115–130 GeV and the repeated observation of small but consistent event excesses across multiple channels at both ATLAS and CMS in the 124-126 GeV region (described as "tantalising hints" of around 2-3 sigma) were public knowledge with "a lot of interest". 168 It was therefore widely anticipated around the end of 2011, that the LHC would provide sufficient data to either exclude or confirm the finding of a Higgs boson by the end of 2012, when their 2012 collision data (with slightly higher 8 TeV collision energy) had been examined. 169 170  Discovery of candidate boson at CERN         Feynman diagrams showing the cleanest channels associated with the low-mass (~125 GeV) Higgs boson candidate observed by ATLAS and CMS at the LHC . The dominant production mechanism at this mass involves two gluons from each proton fusing to a Top-quark Loop , which couples strongly to the Higgs field to produce a Higgs boson. Left: Diphoton channel: Boson subsequently decays into 2 gamma ray photons by virtual interaction with a W boson loop or top quark loop. Right: 4-Lepton "golden channel": Boson emits 2 Z bosons , which each decay into 2 leptons (electrons, muons). Experimental analysis of these channels reached a significance of more than 5 sigma in both experiments. {{Cite arXiv     On 22 June 2012 CERN announced an upcoming seminar covering tentative findings for 2012, 171 172 and shortly afterwards (from around 1 July 2012 according to an analysis of the spreading rumour in social media 173 ) rumours began to spread in the media that this would include a major announcement, but it was unclear whether this would be a stronger signal or a formal discovery. 174 175 Speculation escalated to a "fevered" pitch when reports emerged that Peter Higgs , who proposed the particle, was to be attending the seminar, 176 177 and that "five leading physicists" had been invited – generally believed to signify the five living 1964 authors – with Higgs, Englert, Guralnik, Hagen attending and Kibble confirming his invitation (Brout having died in 2011). 178 179  On 4 July 2012 both of the CERN experiments announced they had independently made the same discovery: 180 CMS of a previously unknown boson with mass 125.3 ± 0.6 GeV/ c 2 181 182 and ATLAS of a boson with mass 126.0 ± 0.6 GeV/ c 2 . 183 184 Using the combined analysis of two interaction types (known as 'channels'), both experiments independently reached a local significance of 5 sigma — implying that the probability of getting at least as strong a result by chance alone is less than 1 in 3 million. When additional channels were taken into account, the CMS significance was reduced to 4.9 sigma. 185  The two teams had been working 'blinded' from each other from around late 2011 or early 2012, 186 meaning they did not discuss their results with each other, providing additional certainty that any common finding was genuine validation of a particle. 187 This level of evidence, confirmed independently by two separate teams and experiments, meets the formal level of proof required to announce a confirmed discovery.  On 31 July 2012, the ATLAS collaboration presented additional data analysis on the "observation of a new particle", including data from a third channel, which improved the significance to 5.9 sigma (1 in 588 million chance of obtaining at least as strong evidence by random background effects alone) and mass , 188 and CMS improved the significance to 5-sigma and mass . 189  The new particle tested as a possible Higgs boson  Following the 2012 discovery, it was still unconfirmed whether or not the 125 GeV/ c 2 particle was a Higgs boson. On one hand, observations remained consistent with the observed particle being the Standard Model Higgs boson, and the particle decayed into at least some of the predicted channels. Moreover, the production rates and branching ratios for the observed channels broadly matched the predictions by the Standard Model within the experimental uncertainties. However, the experimental uncertainties currently still left room for alternative explanations, meaning an announcement of the discovery of a Higgs boson would have been premature. 190 To allow more opportunity for data collection, the LHC's proposed 2012 shutdown and 2013–14 upgrade were postponed by 7 weeks into 2013. 191  In November 2012, in a conference in Kyoto researchers said evidence gathered since July was falling into line with the basic Standard Model more than its alternatives, with a range of results for several interactions matching that theory's predictions. 192 Physicist Matt Strassler highlighted "considerable" evidence that the new particle is not a pseudoscalar  negative parity particle (consistent with this required finding for a Higgs boson), "evaporation" or lack of increased significance for previous hints of non-Standard Model findings, expected Standard Model interactions with W and Z bosons , absence of "significant new implications" for or against supersymmetry , and in general no significant deviations to date from the results expected of a Standard Model Higgs boson. 193 However some kinds of extensions to the Standard Model would also show very similar results; 194 so commentators noted that based on other particles that are still being understood long after their discovery, it may take years to be sure, and decades to fully understand the particle that has been found. 195 196  These findings meant that as of January 2013, scientists were very sure they had found an unknown particle of mass ~ 125 GeV/ c 2 , and had not been misled by experimental error or a chance result. They were also sure, from initial observations, that the new particle was some kind of boson. The behaviours and properties of the particle, so far as examined since July 2012, also seemed quite close to the behaviours expected of a Higgs boson. Even so, it could still have been a Higgs boson or some other unknown boson, since future tests could show behaviours that do not match a Higgs boson, so as of December 2012 CERN still only stated that the new particle was "consistent with" the Higgs boson, 197 198 and scientists did not yet positively say it was the Higgs boson. 199 Despite this, in late 2012, widespread media reports announced (incorrectly) that a Higgs boson had been confirmed during the year.  In January 2013, CERN director-general Rolf-Dieter Heuer stated that based on data analysis to date, an answer could be possible 'towards' mid-2013, 200 and the deputy chair of physics at Brookhaven National Laboratory stated in February 2013 that a "definitive" answer might require "another few years" after the collider's 2015 restart . 201 In early March 2013, CERN Research Director Sergio Bertolucci stated that confirming spin-0 was the major remaining requirement to determine whether the particle is at least some kind of Higgs boson. 202   Preliminary confirmation of existence and current status  On 14 March 2013 CERN confirmed that:   "CMS and ATLAS have compared a number of options for the spin-parity of this particle, and these all prefer no spin and even parity [two fundamental criteria of a Higgs boson consistent with the Standard Model]. This, coupled with the measured interactions of the new particle with other particles, strongly indicates that it is a Higgs boson." 203    This also makes the particle the first elementary scalar particle to be discovered in nature. 204  Examples of tests used to validate whether the 125 GeV particle is a Higgs boson: 205 206        Requirement   How tested / explanation   Current status (March 2013)       Zero spin   Examining decay patterns.

For some time the particle was known by a combination of its PRL author names (including at times Anderson), for example the Brout–Englert–Higgs particle, the Anderson-Higgs particle, or the Englert–Brout–Higgs–Guralnik–Hagen–Kibble mechanism, and these are still used at times. 217 218 Fueled in part by the issue of recognition and a potential shared Nobel Prize, 219 220 the most appropriate name is still occasionally a topic of debate as at 2012. 221 (Higgs himself prefers to call the particle either by an acronym of all those involved, or "the scalar boson", or "the so-called Higgs particle". 222 )  A considerable amount has been written on how Higgs' name came to be exclusively used. Two main explanations are offered.        Reason   Basis of explanation       Higgs undertook a step which was either unique, clearer or more explicit in his paper, in formally predicting and examining the particle.   Of the PRL papers' authors, only the paper by Higgs explicitly offered as a prediction, that a massive particle would exist, and calculated some of its properties; 223 224 he was therefore "the first to postulate the existence of a massive particle" according to Nature . 225 Physicist and author Frank Close and physicist-blogger Peter Woit both comment that the paper by GHK was also completed after Higgs and Brout–Englert were submitted to Physical Review Letters . 226 227 and that Higgs alone had drawn attention to a predicted massive scalar boson, while all others had focused on the massive vector bosons; 228 229 In this way, Higgs' contribution also provided experimentalists with a crucial "concrete target" needed to test the theory. 230 However, in Higgs' view, Brout and Englert did not explicitly mention the boson since its existence is plainly obvious in their work, 231 while according to Guralnik the GHK paper was a complete analysis of the entire symmetry breaking mechanism whose mathematical rigour is absent from the other two papers, and a massive particle may exist in some solutions. 232 Higgs' paper also provided an "especially sharp" statement of the challenge and its solution according to science historian David Kaiser. 233     The name was popularised in the 1970s due to its use as a convenient shorthand or because of a mistake in citing.   Many accounts (including Higgs' own 234 ) credit the "Higgs" name to physicist Benjamin Lee (in ). Lee was a significant populist for the theory in its early stages, and habitually attached the name "Higgs" as a "convenient shorthand" for its components from 1972 235 236 237 238 239 and in at least one instance from as early as 1966. Although Lee clarified in his footnotes that "'Higgs' is an abbreviation for Higgs, Kibble, Guralnik, Hagen, Brout, Englert", 240 his use of the term (and perhaps also Steven Weinberg's mistaken cite of Higgs' paper as the first in his seminal 1967 paper 241 242 {{#tag:ref| (See also original article in New York Review of Books 243 and Frank Close's 2011 book The Infinity Puzzle 244  ([ https://books.google.com/books?id=EDySwmXOEhMC&printsec; ;=frontcover&dq;=the+infinity+puzzle&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=F9oaUc-NLYqe0QXCoYGIBQ&redir;_esc=y#v=snippet&q;=unintended%20consequence%20for%20history&f;=false Book extract]) which identified the error)|name=Lee_Weinberg_2012_name}} ) meant that by around 1975–76 others had also begun to use the name 'Higgs' exclusively as a shorthand. 245       Nickname  The Higgs boson is often referred to as the "God particle" in popular media outside the scientific community. 246 247 248 249 250 The nickname comes from the title of the 1993 book on the Higgs boson and particle physics - The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question? by Nobel Physics prizewinner and Fermilab director Leon Lederman . Lederman wrote it in the context of failing US government support for the Superconducting Super Collider , 251 a part-constructed titanic 252 253 competitor to the Large Hadron Collider with planned collision energies of  that was championed by Lederman since its 1983 inception 254 255 256 and shut down in 1993. The book sought in part to promote awareness of the significance and need for such a project in the face of its possible loss of funding. 257 Lederman, a leading researcher in the field, wanted to title his book “The Goddamn Particle: If the Universe is the Answer, What is the Question?” But his editor decided that the title was too controversial and convinced Lederman to change the title to “The God Particle: If the Universe is the Answer, What is the Question?” 258  And since the Higgs Boson deals with how matter was formed at the time of the big bang, and since newspapers loved the term, the term “God particle" was used.  While media use of this term may have contributed to wider awareness and interest, 259 many scientists feel the name is inappropriate 260 261 262 since it is sensational hyperbole and misleads readers; 263 the particle also has nothing to do with God , leaves open numerous questions in fundamental physics , and does not explain the ultimate origin of the universe . Higgs , an atheist , was reported to be displeased and stated in a 2008 interview that he found it "embarrassing" because it was "the kind of misuse... which I think might offend some people". 264 265 266 Science writer Ian Sample stated in his 2010 book on the search that the nickname is "universally hate[d]" by physicists and perhaps the "worst derided" in the history of physics , but that (according to Lederman) the publisher rejected all titles mentioning "Higgs" as unimaginative and too unknown. 267  Lederman begins with a review of the long human search for knowledge, and explains that his tongue-in-cheek title draws an analogy between the impact of the Higgs field on the fundamental symmetries at the Big Bang , and the apparent chaos of structures, particles, forces and interactions that resulted and shaped our present universe, with the biblical story of Babel in which the primordial single language of early Genesis was fragmented into many disparate languages and cultures. 268   Lederman asks whether the Higgs boson was added just to perplex and confound those seeking knowledge of the universe, and whether physicists will be confounded by it as recounted in that story, or ultimately surmount the challenge and understand "how beautiful is the universe [God has] made". Lederman, p. 22 et seq :   "Something we cannot yet detect and which, one might say, has been put there to test and confuse us ... The issue is whether physicists will be confounded by this puzzle or whether, in contrast to the unhappy Babylonians, we will continue to build the tower and, as Einstein put it, 'know the mind of God'."  "And the Lord said, Behold the people are un-confounding my confounding. And the Lord sighed and said, Go to, let us go down, and there give them the God Particle so that they may see how beautiful is the universe I have made".   Other proposals  A renaming competition by British newspaper The Guardian in 2009 resulted in their science correspondent choosing the name "the champagne bottle boson" as the best submission: "The bottom of a champagne bottle is in the shape of the Higgs potential and is often used as an illustration in physics lectures. So it's not an embarrassingly grandiose name, it is memorable, and [it] has some physics connection too." 269 The name Higgson was suggested as well, in an opinion piece in the Institute of Physics ' online publication physicsworld.com . 270  Media explanations and analogies  There has been considerable public discussion of analogies and explanations for the Higgs particle and how the field creates mass, 271 272 including coverage of explanatory attempts in their own right and a competition in 1993 for the best popular explanation by then-UK Minister for Science Sir William Waldegrave 273 and articles in newspapers worldwide.  An educational collaboration involving an LHC physicist and a High School Teachers at CERN educator suggests that dispersion of light – responsible for the rainbow and dispersive prism – is a useful analogy for the Higgs field's symmetry breaking and mass-causing effect. 274        Symmetry breaking in optics   In a vacuum, light of all colours (or photons of all wavelengths ) travels at the same velocity , a symmetrical situation. In some substances such as glass , water or air , this symmetry is broken (See: Photons in matter ) . The result is that light of different wavelengths appears to have different velocities (as seen from outside).       In 'naive' gauge theories, gauge bosons and other fundamental particles are all massless – also a symmetrical situation. In the presence of the Higgs field this symmetry is broken. The result is that particles of different types will have different masses.       Matt Strassler uses electric fields as an analogy: 275   A similar explanation was offered by The Guardian : 276   The Higgs field's effect on particles was famously described by physicist David Miller as akin to a room full of political party workers spread evenly throughout a room: the crowd gravitates to and slows down famous people but does not slow down others. He also drew attention to well-known effects in solid state physics where an electron's effective mass can be much greater than usual in the presence of a crystal lattice. 277  Analogies based on drag effects, including analogies of " syrup " or " molasses " are also well known, but can be somewhat misleading since they may be understood (incorrectly) as saying that the Higgs field simply resists some particles' motion but not others' – a simple resistive effect could also conflict with Newton's third law . 278  Recognition and awards  There has been considerable discussion of how to allocate the credit if the Higgs boson is proven, made more pointed as a Nobel prize had been expected, and the very wide basis of people entitled to consideration. These include a range of theoreticians who made the Higgs mechanism theory possible, the theoreticians of the 1964 PRL papers (including Higgs himself), the theoreticians who derived from these, a working electroweak theory and the Standard Model itself, and also the experimentalists at CERN and other institutions who made possible the proof of the Higgs field and boson in reality. The Nobel prize has a limit of 3 persons to share an award, and some possible winners are already prize holders for other work, or are deceased (the prize is only awarded to persons in their lifetime). Existing prizes for works relating to the Higgs field, boson, or mechanism include:   Nobel Prize in Physics (1979) – Glashow , Salam , and Weinberg , for contributions to the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles  279  Nobel Prize in Physics (1999) – 't Hooft and Veltman , for elucidating the quantum structure of electroweak interactions in physics  280  Nobel Prize in Physics (2008) – Nambu (shared), for the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in subatomic physics  281  J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics (2010) – Hagen, Englert, Guralnik, Higgs, Brout, and Kibble, for elucidation of the properties of spontaneous symmetry breaking in four-dimensional relativistic gauge theory and of the mechanism for the consistent generation of vector boson masses  282 (for the 1964 papers described above )  Wolf Prize (2004) – Englert, Brout, and Higgs  Nobel Prize in Physics (2013) - Peter Higgs and François Englert , for the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider  283   Additionally Physical Review Letters ' 50-year review (2008) recognized the 1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers and Weinberg's 1967 paper A model of Leptons (the most cited paper in particle physics, as of 2012) "milestone Letters". 284  Following reported observation of the Higgs-like particle in July 2012, several Indian media outlets reported on the supposed neglect of credit to Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose after whose work in the 1920s the class of particles " bosons " is named 285 286 (although physicists have described Bose's connection to the discovery as tenuous). 287  Technical aspects and mathematical formulation  In the Standard Model, the Higgs field is a four-component scalar field that forms a complex doublet of the weak isospin  SU(2) symmetry:      \left( \begin{array}{c} \phi^1 + i\phi^2 \\ \phi^0+i\phi^3 \end{array} \right)\;, | 1 }} while the field has charge +1/2 under the weak hypercharge  U(1) symmetry (in the convention where the electric charge, Q , the weak isospin , I 3 , and the weak hypercharge, Y , are related by Q = I 3 + Y ). 288  (Figure)  The potential for the Higgs field, plotted as function of    ϕ  0     superscript  ϕ  0    \phi^{0}   and    ϕ  3     superscript  ϕ  3    \phi^{3}   . It has a Mexican-hat or champagne-bottle profile at the ground.   The Higgs part of the Lagrangian is 289      where    W  μ  a     superscript   subscript  W  μ   a    W_{\mu}^{a}   and    B  μ     subscript  B  μ    B_{\mu}   are the gauge bosons of the SU(2) and U(1) symmetries,   g   g   g   and    g  ′     superscript  g  normal-′    g^{\prime}   their respective coupling constants ,     τ  a   =    σ  a   /  2        superscript  τ  a      superscript  σ  a   2     \tau^{a}=\sigma^{a}/2   (where    σ  a     superscript  σ  a    \sigma^{a}   are the Pauli matrices ) a complete set generators of the SU(2) symmetry, and    λ  >  0      λ  0    \lambda>0   and     μ  2   >  0       superscript  μ  2   0    \mu^{2}>0   , so that the ground state breaks the SU(2) symmetry (see figure). The ground state of the Higgs field (the bottom of the potential) is degenerate with different ground states related to each other by a SU(2) gauge transformation. It is always possible to pick a gauge such that in the ground state     ϕ  1   =   ϕ  2   =   ϕ  3   =  0         superscript  ϕ  1    superscript  ϕ  2         superscript  ϕ  3        0     \phi^{1}=\phi^{2}=\phi^{3}=0   . The expectation value of    ϕ  0     superscript  ϕ  0    \phi^{0}   in the ground state (the vacuum expectation value or vev) is then     ⟨   ϕ  0   ⟩   =  v       delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  ϕ  0    v    \langle\phi^{0}\rangle=v   , where    v  =    |  μ  |    λ        v      μ     λ      v=\tfrac{|\mu|}{\sqrt{\lambda}}   . The measured value of this parameter is ~. 290 It has units of mass, and is the only free parameter of the Standard Model that is not a dimensionless number. Quadratic terms in    W  μ     subscript  W  μ    W_{\mu}   and    B  μ     subscript  B  μ    B_{\mu}   arise, which give masses to the W and Z bosons: 291      2,| 4 }}    with their ratio determining the Weinberg angle ,     cos   θ  W    =    M  W    M  Z    =    |  g  |      g  2   +   g   ′   2               subscript  θ  W       subscript  M  W    subscript  M  Z             g        superscript  g  2    superscript   superscript  g  normal-′   2         \cos\theta_{W}=\frac{M_{W}}{M_{Z}}=\frac{|g|}{\sqrt{g^{2}+{g^{\prime}}^{2}}}   , and leave a massless U(1) photon ,   γ   γ   \gamma   .  The quarks and the leptons interact with the Higgs field through Yukawa interaction terms:    \overline u_L^i u_R^j    +\lambda_u^{ij}\frac{\phi^1-i\phi^2}{\sqrt{2}}\overline d_L^i u_R^j\\ &-\lambda_d^{ij}\frac{\phi^0+i\phi^3}{\sqrt{2}}\overline d_L^i d_R^j -\lambda_d^{ij}\frac{\phi^1+i\phi^2}{\sqrt{2}}\overline u_L^i d_R^j\\ &-\lambda_e^{ij}\frac{\phi^0+i\phi^3}{\sqrt{2}}\overline e_L^i e_R^j -\lambda_e^{ij}\frac{\phi^1+i\phi^2}{\sqrt{2}}\overline \nu_L^i e_R^j + \textrm{h.c.},\end{align}| 5 }} where     (  d  ,  u  ,  e  ,  ν  )    L  ,  R   i     superscript   subscript   d  u  e  ν    L  R    i    (d,u,e,\nu)_{L,R}^{i}   are left-handed and right-handed quarks and leptons of the i th generation ,    λ   u  ,  d  ,  e    i  j      superscript   subscript  λ   u  d  e      i  j     \lambda_{u,d,e}^{ij}   are matrices of Yukawa couplings where h.c. denotes the hermitian conjugate terms. In the symmetry breaking ground state, only the terms containing    ϕ  0     superscript  ϕ  0    \phi^{0}   remain, giving rise to mass terms for the fermions. Rotating the quark and lepton fields to the basis where the matrices of Yukawa couplings are diagonal, one gets      where the masses of the fermions are     m   u  ,  d  ,  e   i   =     λ   u  ,  d  ,  e   i   v   /   2         superscript   subscript  m   u  d  e    i        superscript   subscript  λ   u  d  e    i   v     2      m_{u,d,e}^{i}=\lambda_{u,d,e}^{i}v/\sqrt{2}   , and    λ   u  ,  d  ,  e   i     superscript   subscript  λ   u  d  e    i    \lambda_{u,d,e}^{i}   denote the eigenvalues of the Yukawa matrices. 292  See also   Standard Model    Quantum gauge theory  History of quantum field theory  Introduction to quantum mechanics  Noncommutative standard model and noncommutative geometry generally  Standard Model (mathematical formulation) (and especially Standard Model fields overview and mass terms and the Higgs mechanism )    Other    Bose–Einstein statistics  Dalitz plot  Higgs boson in fiction  Quantum triviality  ZZ diboson  Scalar boson  Stueckelberg action  Tachyonic field   Notes  References  Further reading          External links  Popular science, mass media, and general coverage   Hunting the Higgs Boson at C.M.S.

The article quotes Fermilab 's Joseph Lykken: "[T]he parameters for our universe, including the Higgs [and top quark's masses] suggest that we're just at the edge of stability, in a "metastable" state. Physicists have been contemplating such a possibility for more than 30 years. Back in 1982, physicists Michael Turner and Frank Wilczek wrote in Nature that "without warning, a bubble of true vacuum could nucleate somewhere in the universe and move outwards..." ↩   If the Standard Model is correct, then the particles and forces we observe in our universe exist as they do, because of underlying quantum fields. Quantum fields can have states of differing stability, including 'stable', 'unstable' and ' metastable ' states (the latter remain stable unless sufficiently perturbed ). If a more stable vacuum state were able to arise, then existing particles and forces would no longer arise as they presently do. Different particles or forces would arise from (and be shaped by) whatever new quantum states arose. The world we know depends upon these particles and forces, so if this happened, everything around us, from subatomic particles to galaxies , and all fundamental forces , would be reconstituted into new fundamental particles and forces and structures. The universe would potentially lose all of its present structures and become inhabited by new ones (depending upon the exact states involved) based upon the same quantum fields. ↩   ↩  ↩   ↩  Higgs Matters – Kathy Sykes, 30 Nove 2012 ↩  Why the public should care about the Higgs Boson – Jodi Lieberman, American Physical Society (APS) ↩  Matt Strassler's blog – Why the Higgs particle matters 2 July 2012 ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩    ↩  ↩  The Nobel Prize in Physics 2008 – official Nobel Prize website. ↩  , at APS Journals ↩  – the original 2001 paper can be found at: ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩    ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩   Letters from the Past – A PRL Retrospective (50 year celebration, 2008) ↩        ↩   ↩  – quoted as being in the first (1990) edition of the book by Peter Higgs in his talk "My Life as a Boson", 2001, ref#25. ↩   American Physical Society – ↩  ↩     ↩    ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩  Lisa Randall, Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions , p.286: "People initially thought of tachyons as particles travelling faster than the speed of light...But we now know that a tachyon indicates an instability in a theory that contains it.
