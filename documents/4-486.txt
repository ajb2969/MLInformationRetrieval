   Analytic capacity      Analytic capacity   In complex analysis , the analytic capacity of a compact subset  K of the complex plane is a number that denotes "how big" a bounded  analytic function from C \ K can become. Roughly speaking, γ( K ) measures the size of the unit ball of the space of bounded analytic functions outside K .  It was first introduced by Ahlfors in the 1940s while studying the removability of singularities of bounded analytic functions.  Definition  Let K ⊂ C be compact . Then its analytic capacity is defined to be      γ   (  K  )   =  sup   {  |   f  ′    (  ∞  )   |  ;  f  ∈   ℋ  ∞    (  𝐂  ∖  K  )   ,  ∥  f   ∥  ∞   ≤  1  ,  f   (  ∞  )   =  0  }      fragments  γ   fragments  normal-(  K  normal-)    supremum   fragments  normal-{  normal-|   superscript  f  normal-′    fragments  normal-(   normal-)   normal-|  normal-;  f    superscript  ℋ     fragments  normal-(  C   K  normal-)   normal-,  parallel-to  f   subscript  parallel-to     1  normal-,  f   fragments  normal-(   normal-)    0  normal-}     \gamma(K)=\sup\{|f^{\prime}(\infty)|;\ f\in\mathcal{H}^{\infty}(\mathbf{C}%
 \setminus K),\ \|f\|_{\infty}\leq 1,\ f(\infty)=0\}     Here,     ℋ  ∞    (  U  )        superscript  ℋ    U    \mathcal{H}^{\infty}(U)   denotes the set of bounded analytic functions  U → C , whenever U is an open subset of the complex plane . Further,        f  ′    (  ∞  )    :=    lim   z  →  ∞     z   (    f   (  z  )    -   f   (  ∞  )     )        assign     superscript  f  normal-′       subscript    normal-→  z       z      f  z     f         f^{\prime}(\infty):=\lim_{z\to\infty}z\left(f(z)-f(\infty)\right)          f   (  ∞  )    :=    lim   z  →  ∞     f   (  z  )        assign    f      subscript    normal-→  z       f  z      f(\infty):=\lim_{z\to\infty}f(z)     (note that usually      f  ′    (  ∞  )    ≠    lim   z  →  ∞      f  ′    (  z  )            superscript  f  normal-′       subscript    normal-→  z        superscript  f  normal-′   z      f^{\prime}(\infty)\neq\lim_{z\to\infty}f^{\prime}(z)   )  Ahlfors function  For each compact K ⊂ C , there exists a unique extremal function, i.e.    f  ∈    ℋ  ∞    (   𝐂  ∖  K   )        f     superscript  ℋ      𝐂  K      f\in\mathcal{H}^{\infty}(\mathbf{C}\setminus K)   such that     ∥  f  ∥   ≤  1       norm  f   1    \|f\|\leq 1   , f (∞) = 0 and f′ (∞) = γ( K ). This function is called the Ahlfors function of K . Its existence can be proved by using a normal family argument involving Montel's theorem .  Analytic capacity in terms of Hausdorff dimension  Let dim H denote Hausdorff dimension and H 1 denote 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure . Then H 1 ( K ) = 0 implies γ( K ) = 0 while dim H ( K ) > 1 guarantees γ( K ) > 0. However, the case when dim H ( K ) = 1 and H 1 ( K ) ∈ (0, ∞] is more difficult.  Positive length but zero analytic capacity  Given the partial correspondence between the 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure of a compact subset of C and its analytic capacity, it might be conjectured that γ( K ) = 0 implies H 1 ( K ) = 0. However, this conjecture is false. A counterexample was first given by A. G. Vitushkin , and a much simpler one by J. Garnett in his 1970 paper. This latter example is the linear four corners Cantor set , constructed as follows:  Let K 0 := [0, 1] × [0, 1] be the unit square. Then, K 1 is the union of 4 squares of side length 1/4 and these squares are located in the corners of K 0 . In general, K n is the union of 4 n squares (denoted by    Q  n  j     superscript   subscript  Q  n   j    Q_{n}^{j}   ) of side length 4 − n , each    Q  n  j     superscript   subscript  Q  n   j    Q_{n}^{j}   being in the corner of some    Q   n  -  1   k     superscript   subscript  Q    n  1    k    Q_{n-1}^{k}   . Take K to be the intersection of all K n then      H  1    (  K  )    =   2          superscript  H  1   K     2     H^{1}(K)=\sqrt{2}   but γ( K ) = 0.  Vitushkin's conjecture  Suppose dim H ( K ) = 1 and H 1 ( K ) > 0. Vitushkin's conjecture states that        γ   (  K  )    =   0    ⇔    K   is purely unrectifiable      normal-⇔      γ  K   0     K  is purely unrectifiable     \gamma(K)=0\ \Leftrightarrow\ K\ \text{ is purely unrectifiable}     In this setting, K is (purely) unrectifiable if and only if H 1 ( K ∩ Γ) = 0 for all rectifiable curves (or equivalently, C 1 -curves or (rotated) Lipschitz graphs) Γ.  Guy David published a proof in 1998 for the case when, in addition to the hypothesis above, H 1 ( K ) 1( K ) is infinite (even sigma-finite ).  Removable sets and Painlevé's problem  The compact set K is called removable if, whenever Ω is an open set containing K , every function which is bounded and holomorphic on the set Ω\ K has an analytic extension to all of Ω. By Riemann's theorem for removable singularities , every singleton is removable. This motivated Painlevé to pose a more general question in 1880: "Which subsets of C are removable?"  It is easy to see that K is removable if and only if γ( K ) = 0. However, analytic capacity is a purely complex-analytic concept, and much more work needs to be done in order to obtain a more geometric characterization.  References     J.
