TRNA (cytosine38-C5)-methyltransferase

TRNA (cytosine38-C5)-methyltransferase (, hDNMT2 (gene), DNMT2 (gene), TRDMT1 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (cytosine38-C5)-methyltransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine38 in tRNA 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methylcytosine38 in tRNA
 

The eukaryotic enzyme catalyses methylation of cytosine38 in the anti-codon loop of tRNAAsp(GTC), tRNAVal(AAC) and tRNAGly(GCC).
