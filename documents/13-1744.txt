Multiple gamma function

In mathematics, the multiple gamma function ΓN is a generalization of the Euler Gamma function and the Barnes G-function. The double gamma function was studied . At the end of this paper he mentioned the existence of multiple gamma functions generalizing it, and studied these further in .
Double gamma functions Γ2 are closely related to the q-gamma function, and triple gamma functions Γ3 are related to the elliptic gamma function.
Definition


 
  where ζN is the Barnes zeta function. (This differs by a constant from Barnes's original definition.)
Properties
Considered as a meromorphic function of w, ΓN(w|a1,...) has no zeros, and has poles exactly at the values w=−n1a1+...+nNaN for non-negative integers n1,..., which are simple poles unless some of these numbers coincide. Up to multiplication by the exponential of a polynomial, it is the unique meromorphic function of finite order with these zeros and poles.

Γ0(w|)= 1/w
Γ1(w|a)= aw/a − 1/2Γ(w/a)/√(2π)
