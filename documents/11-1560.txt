Pantetheine kinase

In enzymology, a pantetheine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + pantetheine 
 
 
 
  ADP + pantetheine 4'-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and pantetheine, whereas its two products are ADP and pantetheine 4'-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:pantetheine 4'-phosphotransferase. This enzyme is also called pantetheine kinase (phosphorylating). This enzyme participates in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis.
