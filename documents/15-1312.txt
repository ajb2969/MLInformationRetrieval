TRNA (guanine26-N2)-dimethyltransferase

TRNA (guanine26-N2)-dimethyltransferase (, Trm1p, TRM1, tRNA (m22G26)dimethyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanine26-N2)-dimethyltransferase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine26 in tRNA 
 
 
 
  2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N2-dimethylguanine26 in tRNA
 

The enzyme dissociates from its tRNA substrate between the two consecutive methylation reactions.
