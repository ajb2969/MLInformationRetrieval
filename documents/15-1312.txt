   TRNA (guanine26-N2)-dimethyltransferase      TRNA (guanine26-N2)-dimethyltransferase   TRNA (guanine 26 -N 2 )-dimethyltransferase (, Trm1p , TRM1 , tRNA (m22G26)dimethyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanine 26 -N 2 )-dimethyltransferase . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine 26 in tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 2 -dimethylguanine26 in tRNA   The enzyme dissociates from its tRNA substrate between the two consecutive methylation reactions.
