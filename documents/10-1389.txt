Gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase

In enzymology, a gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2,5-dihydroxybenzoate + O2

 
  maleylpyruvate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate and O2, whereas its product is 3-maleylpyruvate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on single donors with O2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2. The systematic name of this enzyme class is gentisate:oxygen 1,2-oxidoreductase (decyclizing). Other names in common use include gentisate oxygenase, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate dioxygenase, gentisate dioxygenase, and gentisic acid oxidase. This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism. It employs one cofactor, iron.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
