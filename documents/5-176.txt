Relative thermal resistance

Relative thermal resistance is a measure of the energy required to mix water of two different temperatures (and thus different densities). Comparisons will be made against the differences in the density of water at 3.98 °C and 5 °C. (Wetzel 1983) Since this is a relative measure, there are no units involved.
It is calculated at intervals of 1 cm using the following equation: 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the density at the bottom of the stratum being considered and 
 
 
 
  is the density at the top of the stratum being considered
