   Relative thermal resistance      Relative thermal resistance   Relative thermal resistance is a measure of the energy required to mix water of two different temperatures (and thus different densities ). Comparisons will be made against the differences in the density of water at 3.98 °C and 5 °C. (Wetzel 1983) Since this is a relative measure, there are no units involved.  It is calculated at intervals of 1 cm using the following equation:     R  T  R   =    (    (    p  1   -   p  2    )   ×   10  6    )   /  8         R  T  R          subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2     superscript  10  6    8     RTR=((p_{1}-p_{2})\times 10^{6})/8   where    p  2     subscript  p  2    p_{2}   is the density at the bottom of the stratum being considered and    p  1     subscript  p  1    p_{1}   is the density at the top of the stratum being considered  See also   Limnology   "  Category:Limnology  Category:Hydrography  Category:Lakes
