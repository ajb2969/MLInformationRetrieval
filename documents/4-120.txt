   Kochanek–Bartels spline      Kochanek–Bartels spline   (Figure)  Kochanek bartels spline.svg   In mathematics , a Kochanek–Bartels spline or Kochanek–Bartels curve is a cubic Hermite spline with tension, bias, and continuity parameters defined to change the behavior of the tangents .  Given n + 1 knots ,   p 0 , ..., p n ,   to be interpolated with n cubic Hermite curve segments, for each curve we have a starting point p i and an ending point p i +1 with starting tangent d i and ending tangent d i +1 defined by       𝐝  i   =       (   1  -  t   )    (   1  +  b   )    (   1  +  c   )    2    (    𝐩  i   -   𝐩   i  -  1     )    +      (   1  -  t   )    (   1  -  b   )    (   1  -  c   )    2    (    𝐩   i  +  1    -   𝐩  i    )          subscript  𝐝  i             1  t     1  b     1  c    2      subscript  𝐩  i    subscript  𝐩    i  1              1  t     1  b     1  c    2      subscript  𝐩    i  1     subscript  𝐩  i        \mathbf{d}_{i}=\frac{(1-t)(1+b)(1+c)}{2}(\mathbf{p}_{i}-\mathbf{p}_{i-1})+%
 \frac{(1-t)(1-b)(1-c)}{2}(\mathbf{p}_{i+1}-\mathbf{p}_{i})          𝐝   i  +  1    =       (   1  -  t   )    (   1  +  b   )    (   1  -  c   )    2    (    𝐩   i  +  1    -   𝐩  i    )    +      (   1  -  t   )    (   1  -  b   )    (   1  +  c   )    2    (    𝐩   i  +  2    -   𝐩   i  +  1     )          subscript  𝐝    i  1              1  t     1  b     1  c    2      subscript  𝐩    i  1     subscript  𝐩  i             1  t     1  b     1  c    2      subscript  𝐩    i  2     subscript  𝐩    i  1         \mathbf{d}_{i+1}=\frac{(1-t)(1+b)(1-c)}{2}(\mathbf{p}_{i+1}-\mathbf{p}_{i})+%

The source code found here of Steve Noskowicz in 1996 actually describes the impact that each of these values has on the drawn curve:      Tension   T = +1→ Tight   T = −1→ Round      Bias   B = +1→ Post Shoot   B = −1→ Pre shoot     Continuity   C = +1→ Inverted corners   C = −1→ Box corners     The code includes matrix summary needed to generate these splines in a BASIC dialect.
