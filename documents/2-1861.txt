   Totally disconnected space      Totally disconnected space   In topology and related branches of mathematics , a totally disconnected space is a topological space that is maximally disconnected, in the sense that it has no non-trivial connected subsets. In every topological space the empty set and the one-point sets are connected; in a totally disconnected space these are the only connected subsets.  An important example of a totally disconnected space is the Cantor set . Another example, playing a key role in algebraic number theory , is the field Q p of p -adic numbers .  Definition  A topological space X is totally disconnected if the connected components in X are the one-point sets.  Examples  The following are examples of totally disconnected spaces:   Discrete spaces  The rational numbers  The irrational numbers  The p-adic numbers ; more generally, profinite groups are totally disconnected.  The Cantor set  The Baire space  The Sorgenfrey line  Zero-dimensional  T 1 spaces  Extremally disconnected Hausdorff spaces  Stone spaces  The Knaster–Kuratowski fan provides an example of a connected space, such that the removal of a single point produces a totally disconnected space.  The Erdős space ℓ p ( Z )∩    ℚ  ω     superscript  ℚ  ω    \mathbb{Q}^{\omega}   is a totally disconnected space that does not have dimension zero .   Properties   Subspaces , products , and coproducts of totally disconnected spaces are totally disconnected.  Totally disconnected spaces are T 1 spaces , since singletons are closed.  Continuous images of totally disconnected spaces are not necessarily totally disconnected, in fact, every compact  metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set .  A locally compact  hausdorff space is zero-dimensional if and only if it is totally disconnected.  Every totally disconnected compact metric space is homeomorphic to a subset of a countable product of discrete spaces .  It is in general not true that every open set is also closed.  It is in general not true that the closure of every open set is open, i.e. not every totally disconnected Hausdorff space is extremally disconnected .   Constructing a disconnected space  Let   X   X   X   be an arbitrary topological space. Let    x  ∼  y     similar-to  x  y    x\sim y   if and only if    y  ∈   conn   (  x  )        y    conn  x     y\in\mathrm{conn}(x)   (where    conn   (  x  )       conn  x    \mathrm{conn}(x)   denotes the largest connected subset containing   x   x   x   ). This is obviously an equivalence relation. Endow    X  /  ∼     fragments  X   similar-to    X/{\sim}   with the quotient topology, i.e. the coarsest topology making the map    m  :   x  ↦   conn   (  x  )        normal-:  m   maps-to  x    conn  x      m:x\mapsto\mathrm{conn}(x)   continuous. With a little bit of effort we can see that    X  /  ∼     fragments  X   similar-to    X/{\sim}   is totally disconnected. We also have the following universal property : if    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\rightarrow Y   a continuous map to a totally disconnected space, then it uniquely factors into    f  =    f  ˘   ∘  m       f     normal-˘  f   m     f=\breve{f}\circ m   where     f  ˘   :   (  X  /  ∼  )   →  Y     fragments   normal-˘  f   normal-:   fragments  normal-(  X   similar-to  normal-)   normal-→  Y    \breve{f}:(X/\sim)\rightarrow Y   is continuous.
