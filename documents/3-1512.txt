   List of commutative algebra topics      List of commutative algebra topics   Commutative algebra is the branch of abstract algebra that studies commutative rings , their ideals , and modules over such rings. Both algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory build on commutative algebra. Prominent examples of commutative rings include polynomial rings , rings of algebraic integers , including the ordinary integers    ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   , and p-adic integers .
