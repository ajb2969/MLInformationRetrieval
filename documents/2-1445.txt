   Levi-Civita connection      Levi-Civita connection   In Riemannian geometry , the Levi-Civita connection is a specific connection on the tangent bundle of a manifold . More specifically, it is the torsion -free metric connection , i.e., the torsion-free connection on the tangent bundle (an affine connection ) preserving a given ( pseudo- ) Riemannian metric .  The fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry states that there is a unique connection which satisfies these properties.  In the theory of Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds the term covariant derivative is often used for the Levi-Civita connection. The components of this connection with respect to a system of local coordinates are called Christoffel symbols .  History  The Levi-Civita connection is named after Tullio Levi-Civita , although originally "discovered" by Elwin Bruno Christoffel . Levi-Civita, 1 along with Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro , used Christoffel's symbols 2 to define the notion of parallel transport and explore the relationship of parallel transport with the curvature , thus developing the modern notion of holonomy . 3  The Levi-Civita notions of intrinsic derivative and parallel displacement of a vector along a curve make sense on an abstract Riemannian manifold, even though the original motivation relied on a specific embedding        M  n   ‚äÇ   ùêë    n   (   n  +  1   )    2     ,       superscript  M  n    superscript  ùêë      n    n  1    2      M^{n}\subset\mathbf{R}^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}},     since the definition of the Christoffel symbols make sense in any Riemannian manifold. In 1869, Christoffel discovered that the components of the intrinsic derivative of a vector transform as the components of a contravariant vector. This discovery was the real beginning of tensor analysis. It was not until 1917 that Levi-Civita interpreted the intrinsic derivative in the case of an embedded surface as the tangential component of the usual derivative in the ambient affine space.  Notation       (  M  ,  g  )     M  g    (M,g)   denotes a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold .      T  M      T  M    TM   is the tangent bundle of   M   M   M   .     g   g   g   is the Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian metric of   M   M   M   .      X  ,  Y  ,  Z     X  Y  Z    X,Y,Z   are smooth vector fields on   M   M   M   , i. e. smooth sections of    T  M      T  M    TM   .       X  X   ,  Y       X  X   Y    XX,Y   is the Lie bracket of   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   . It is again a smooth vector field.   The metric   g   g   g   can take up to two vectors or vector fields    X  ,  Y     X  Y    X,Y   as arguments. In the former case the output is a number, the (pseudo-) inner product of   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   . In the latter case, the inner product of is taken at all points   p   p   p   on the manifold so that    g   (  X  ,  Y  )       g   X  Y     g(X,Y)   defines a smooth function on   M   M   M   . Vector fields act as differential operators on smooth functions. In a basis, the action reads        X  f   =    X  i    ‚àÇ   ‚àÇ   x  i     f   =    X  i     ‚àÇ  i   f     ,          X  f      superscript  X  i         superscript  x  i     f           superscript  X  i     subscript   i   f       Xf=X^{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i}}f=X^{i}\partial_{i}f,   where Einstein's  summation convention is used.  Formal definition  An affine connection    ‚àá   normal-‚àá   ‚àá   is called a Levi-Civita connection if   it preserves the metric , i.e.,     ‚àá  g   =  0        normal-‚àá  g   0    ‚àág=0   .  it is torsion -free , i.e., for any vector fields   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   we have , where     X  X   ,  Y       X  X   Y    XX,Y   is the Lie bracket of the vector fields    X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   .   Condition 1 above is sometimes referred to as compatibility with the metric , and condition 2 is sometimes called symmetry, cf. DoCarmo's text.  Assuming a Levi-Civita connection exists it is uniquely determined. Using conditions 1 and the symmetry of the metric tensor   g   g   g   we find:          X   (   g   (  Y  ,  Z  )    )    +   Y   (   g   (  Z  ,  X  )    )     -   Z   (   g   (  Y  ,  X  )    )     =    g   (     ‚àá  X   Y   +    ‚àá  Y   X    ,  Z  )    +   g   (     ‚àá  X   Z   -    ‚àá  Z   X    ,  Y  )    +   g   (     ‚àá  Y   Z   -    ‚àá  Z   Y    ,  X  )      .            X    g   Y  Z       Y    g   Z  X        Z    g   Y  X          g       subscript  normal-‚àá  X   Y     subscript  normal-‚àá  Y   X    Z      g       subscript  normal-‚àá  X   Z     subscript  normal-‚àá  Z   X    Y      g       subscript  normal-‚àá  Y   Z     subscript  normal-‚àá  Z   Y    X       X(g(Y,Z))+Y(g(Z,X))-Z(g(Y,X))=g(\nabla_{X}Y+\nabla_{Y}X,Z)+g(\nabla_{X}Z-%
 \nabla_{Z}X,Y)+g(\nabla_{Y}Z-\nabla_{Z}Y,X).     By condition 2 the right hand side is equal to        2  g   (    ‚àá  X   Y   ,  Z  )    -   g   (   [  X  ,  Y  ]   ,  Z  )     +   g   (   [  X  ,  Z  ]   ,  Y  )    +   g   (   [  Y  ,  Z  ]   ,  X  )            2  g     subscript  normal-‚àá  X   Y   Z      g    X  Y   Z       g    X  Z   Y      g    Y  Z   X      2g(\nabla_{X}Y,Z)-g([X,Y],Z)+g([X,Z],Y)+g([Y,Z],X)     so we find        g   (    ‚àá  X   Y   ,  Z  )    =    1  2    {       X   (   g   (  Y  ,  Z  )    )    +   Y   (   g   (  Z  ,  X  )    )     -   Z   (   g   (  X  ,  Y  )    )     +   g   (   [  X  ,  Y  ]   ,  Z  )     -   g   (   [  Y  ,  Z  ]   ,  X  )    -   g   (   [  X  ,  Z  ]   ,  Y  )     }     .        g     subscript  normal-‚àá  X   Y   Z        1  2              X    g   Y  Z       Y    g   Z  X        Z    g   X  Y        g    X  Y   Z       g    Y  Z   X      g    X  Z   Y         g(\nabla_{X}Y,Z)=\frac{1}{2}\{X(g(Y,Z))+Y(g(Z,X))-Z(g(X,Y))+g([X,Y],Z)-g([Y,Z]%
 ,X)-g([X,Z],Y)\}.     Since   Z   Z   Z   is arbitrary, this uniquely determines . Conversely, using the last line as a definition one shows that the expression so defined is a connection compatible with the metric, i.e. is a Levi-Civita connection.  Christoffel symbols  Let ‚àá be the connection of the Riemannian metric. Choose local coordinates     x  1   ‚Ä¶   x  n        superscript  x  1   normal-‚Ä¶   superscript  x  n     x^{1}\ldots x^{n}   and let     Œì  l      j  k       fragments   superscript  normal-Œì  l      j  k      \Gamma^{l}{}_{jk}   be the Christoffel symbols with respect to these coordinates. The torsion freeness condition 2 is then equivalent to the symmetry       Œì  l    =    j  k      Œì  l    .    k  j        fragments   superscript  normal-Œì  l    subscript     j  k     superscript  normal-Œì  l    subscript  normal-.    k  j      \Gamma^{l}{}_{jk}=\Gamma^{l}{}_{kj}.   The definition of the Levi-Civita connection derived above is equivalent to a definition of the Christoffel symbols in terms of the metric as       Œì  l    =    j  k       1  2     g   l  r     {   ‚àÇ  k    g   r  j    +   ‚àÇ  j    g   r  k    -   ‚àÇ  r    g   j  k    }      fragments   superscript  normal-Œì  l    subscript     j  k      1  2    superscript  g    l  r     fragments  normal-{   subscript   k    subscript  g    r  j      subscript   j    subscript  g    r  k      subscript   r    subscript  g    j  k    normal-}     \Gamma^{l}{}_{jk}=\tfrac{1}{2}g^{lr}\left\{\partial_{k}g_{rj}+\partial_{j}g_{%
 rk}-\partial_{r}g_{jk}\right\}   where as usual    g   i  j      superscript  g    i  j     g^{ij}   are the coefficients of the dual metric tensor, i.e. the entries of the inverse of the matrix    (   g   k  l    )     subscript  g    k  l     (g_{kl})   .  Derivative along curve  The Levi-Civita connection (like any affine connection) also defines a derivative along curves , sometimes denoted by D .  Given a smooth curve Œ≥ on (M,g) and a vector field  V along Œ≥ its derivative is defined by         D  t   V   =    ‚àá    Œ≥  Àô    (  t  )     V    .         subscript  D  t   V     subscript  normal-‚àá     normal-Àô  Œ≥   t    V     D_{t}V=\nabla_{\dot{\gamma}(t)}V.   Formally, D is the pullback connection      Œ≥  *   ‚àá       superscript  Œ≥    normal-‚àá    \gamma^{*}\nabla   on the pullback bundle Œ≥* TM .  In particular,     Œ≥  Àô    (  t  )        normal-Àô  Œ≥   t    \dot{\gamma}(t)   is a vector field along the curve Œ≥ itself. If      ‚àá    Œ≥  Àô    (  t  )      Œ≥  Àô     (  t  )         subscript  normal-‚àá     normal-Àô  Œ≥   t     normal-Àô  Œ≥    t    \nabla_{\dot{\gamma}(t)}\dot{\gamma}(t)   vanishes, the curve is called a geodesic of the covariant derivative. Formally, the condition can be restated as the vanishing of the pullback connection applied to    Œ≥  Àô     normal-Àô  Œ≥    \dot{\gamma}   :        (    Œ≥  *   ‚àá   )    Œ≥  Àô    ‚â°  0.           superscript  Œ≥    normal-‚àá    normal-Àô  Œ≥    0.    (\gamma^{*}\nabla)\dot{\gamma}\equiv 0.     If the covariant derivative is the Levi-Civita connection of a certain metric, then the geodesics for the connection are precisely those geodesics of the metric that are parametrised proportionally to their arc length.  Parallel transport  In general, parallel transport along a curve with respect to a connection defines isomorphisms between the tangent spaces at the points of the curve. If the connection is a Levi-Civita connection, then these isomorphisms are orthogonal ‚Äì that is, they preserve the inner products on the various tangent spaces.  Example: The unit sphere in R 3  Let    ‚ü®  ‚ãÖ  ,  ‚ãÖ  ‚ü©     normal-‚ãÖ  normal-‚ãÖ    \langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle   be the usual scalar product on R 3 . Let S 2 be the unit sphere in R 3 . The tangent space to S 2 at a point m is naturally identified with the vector sub-space of R 3 consisting of all vectors orthogonal to m . It follows that a vector field Y on S 2 can be seen as a map Y : S 2 ‚Üí R 3 , which satisfies         ‚ü®   Y   (  m  )    ,  m  ‚ü©   =  0   ,    ‚àÄ  m   ‚àà   ùêí  2     .     formulae-sequence       Y  m   m   0      for-all  m    superscript  ùêí  2      \langle Y(m),m\rangle=0,\qquad\forall m\in\mathbf{S}^{2}.     Denote by d m Y ( X ) the covariant derivative of the map Y in the direction of the vector X . Then we have:   Lemma: The formula        (    ‚àá  X   Y   )    (  m  )    =     d  m   Y   (  X  )    +    ‚ü®   X   (  m  )    ,   Y   (  m  )    ‚ü©   m            subscript  normal-‚àá  X   Y   m        subscript  d  m   Y  X        X  m     Y  m    m      \left(\nabla_{X}Y\right)(m)=d_{m}Y(X)+\langle X(m),Y(m)\rangle m     defines an affine connection on S 2 with vanishing torsion.   Proof: It is straightforward to prove that ‚àá satisfies the Leibniz identity and is C ‚àû ( S 2 ) linear in the first variable. It is also a straightforward computation to show that this connection is torsion free. So all that needs to be proved here is that the formula above does indeed define a vector field. That is, we need to prove that for all m in S 2        ‚ü®    (    ‚àá  X   Y   )    (  m  )    ,  m  ‚ü©   =   0   (  1  )     .           subscript  normal-‚àá  X   Y   m   m    0  1     \langle\left(\nabla_{X}Y\right)(m),m\rangle=0\qquad(1).   Consider the map f that sends every m in S 2 to , which is always 0. The map f is constant, hence its differential vanishes. In particular        d  m   f   (  X  )    =    ‚ü®    d  m   Y   (  X  )    ,  m  ‚ü©   +   ‚ü®   Y   (  m  )    ,   X   (  m  )    ‚ü©    =  0.           subscript  d  m   f  X         subscript  d  m   Y  X   m      Y  m     X  m          0.     d_{m}f(X)=\langle d_{m}Y(X),m\rangle+\langle Y(m),X(m)\rangle=0.   The equation (1) above follows.   ‚ñ°   normal-‚ñ°   \Box     In fact, this connection is the Levi-Civita connection for the metric on S 2 inherited from R 3 . Indeed, one can check that this connection preserves the metric.
