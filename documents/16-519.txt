   Quotient stack      Quotient stack   In algebraic geometry, a quotient stack is a stack that parametrizes equivariant objects. Geometrically, it generalizes a quotient of a scheme or a variety by a group: a quotient variety, say, would be a coarse approximation of a quotient stack.  The notion is of fundamental importance in the study of stacks: a stack that arises in nature is often either a quotient stack itself or admits a stratification by quotient stacks (e.g., a Deligne–Mumford stack .) A quotient stack is also used to construct other stacks like classifying stacks or toric stacks .  Definition  A quotient stack is defined as follows. Let G be an affine smooth group scheme over a scheme S and X a S -scheme on which G acts. Let    [   X  /  G   ]     delimited-[]    X  G     [X/G]   be the category over the category of S -schemes: an object over T is a principal G -bundle  P → T together with equivariant map P → X ; an arrow from P → T to P' → T' is a bundle map (i.e., forms a cartesian diagram) that is compatible with the equivariant maps P → X and P' → X .  Suppose the quotient     X  /  G      X  G    X/G   exists as, say, an algebraic space (for example, by the Keel–Mori theorem ). The canonical map       [   X  /  G   ]   →   X  /  G      normal-→   delimited-[]    X  G      X  G     [X/G]\to X/G   , that sends a bundle P over T to a corresponding T -point, 1 need not be an isomorphism of stacks; that is, the space "X/G" is usually coarser. The canonical map is an isomorphism if and only if the stabilizers are trivial (in which case    X  /  G      X  G    X/G   usually exists.)  In general,    [   X  /  G   ]     delimited-[]    X  G     [X/G]   is an Artin stack (also called algebraic stack). If the stabilizers of the geometric points are finite and reduced, then it is a Deligne–Mumford stack .  Remark: It is possible to approach the construction from the point of view of simplicial sheaves ; cf. 9.2. of Jardine's "local homotopy theory". 2  Examples  If    X  =  S      X  S    X=S   with trivial action of G (often S is a point), then    [   S  /  G   ]     delimited-[]    S  G     [S/G]   is called the classifying stack of G (in analogy with the classifying space of G ) and is usually denoted by BG . Borel's theorem describes the cohomology ring of the classifying stack.  Example: 3 Let L be the Lazard ring ; i.e.,    L  =    π  *   MU       L     subscript  π    MU     L=\pi_{*}\operatorname{MU}   . Then the quotient stack    [   Spec   L  /  G    ]     delimited-[]   Spec    L  G      [\operatorname{Spec}L/G]   by   G   G   G   ,       G   (  R  )    =   {   g  ∈   R   [   [  t  ]   ]     |     g   (  t  )    =     b  0   t   +    b  1    t  2   …     ,    b  0   ∈   R  ×     }         G  R    conditional-set    g    R   delimited-[]   delimited-[]  t       formulae-sequence      g  t        subscript  b  0   t      subscript  b  1    superscript  t  2   normal-…        subscript  b  0    superscript  R         G(R)=\{g\in R[\![t]\!]|g(t)=b_{0}t+b_{1}t^{2}\dots,b_{0}\in R^{\times}\}   , is called the moduli stack of formal group laws , denoted by    ℳ  FG     subscript  ℳ  FG    \mathcal{M}_{\text{FG}}   .
