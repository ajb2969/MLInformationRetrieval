   2-hydroxypyridine 5-monooxygenase      2-hydroxypyridine 5-monooxygenase   In enzymology , a 2-hydroxypyridine 5-monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-hydroxypyridine + AH 2 + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2,5-dihydroxypyridine + A + H 2 O   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 2-hydroxypyridine , an electron acceptor AH 2 , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 2,5-dihydroxypyridine , the reduction product A, and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derive from O miscellaneous. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-hydroxypyridine,hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (5-hydroxylating) . This enzyme is also called 2-hydroxypyridine oxygenase .  References     "  Category:EC 1.14.99  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
