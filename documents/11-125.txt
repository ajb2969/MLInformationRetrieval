   Succinate—CoA ligase (GDP-forming)      Succinate—CoA ligase (GDP-forming)   In enzymology , a succinate-CoA ligase (GDP-forming) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GTP + succinate + CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GDP + phosphate + succinyl-CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are GTP , succinate , and CoA , whereas its 3 products are GDP , phosphate , and succinyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is succinate:CoA ligase (GDP-forming) . Other names in common use include succinyl-CoA synthetase (GDP-forming) , succinyl coenzyme A synthetase (guanosine diphosphate-forming) , succinate thiokinase , succinic thiokinase , succinyl coenzyme A synthetase , succinate-phosphorylating enzyme , P-enzyme , SCS , G-STK , succinyl coenzyme A synthetase (GDP-forming) , succinyl CoA synthetase , and succinyl coenzyme A synthetase . This enzyme participates in the citric acid cycle and propanoate metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .  References   Boyer, P.D., Lardy, H. and Myrback, K.
