   Symmetric relation      Symmetric relation   In mathematics and other areas, a binary relation  R over a set  X is symmetric if it holds for all a and b in X that if a is related to b then b is related to a .  In mathematical notation , this is:          ∀  a   ,  b   ∈  X   ,    a  R  b   ⇒   b  R  a     .     formulae-sequence      for-all  a   b   X    normal-⇒    a  R  b     b  R  a      \forall a,b\in X,\ aRb\Rightarrow\;bRa.     Examples  In mathematics   "is equal to" ( equality ) (whereas "is less than" is not symmetric)  "is comparable to", for elements of a partially ordered set  "... and ... are odd":          Outside mathematics   "is married to" (in most legal systems)  "is a fully biological sibling of"  "is a homophone of"   Relationship to asymmetric and antisymmetric relations  By definition, a relation cannot be both symmetric and asymmetric (where if a is related to b , then b cannot be related to a (in the same way)). However, a relation can be neither symmetric nor asymmetric, which is the case for "is less than or equal to" and "preys on").  Symmetric and antisymmetric (where the only way a can be related to b and b be related to a is if a = b ) are actually independent of each other, as these examples show.      Mathematical examples        Antisymmetric     Not antisymmetric         Non-mathematical examples        Antisymmetric     Not antisymmetric     Additional aspects  A symmetric relation that is also transitive and reflexive is an equivalence relation .  One way to conceptualize a symmetric relation in graph theory is that a symmetric relation is an edge, with the edge's two vertices being the two entities so related. Thus, symmetric relations and undirected graphs are combinatorially equivalent objects.
