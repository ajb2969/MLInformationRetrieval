   Wolstenholme's theorem      Wolstenholme's theorem   In mathematics , Wolstenholme's theorem states that for a prime number  p > 3, the congruence       (       2  p   -  1        p  -  1      )   ≡   1     (   mod   p  3    )         binomial      2  p   1     p  1     annotated  1   pmod   superscript  p  3       {2p-1\choose p-1}\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{3})   holds, where the parentheses denote a binomial coefficient . For example, with p = 7, this says that 1716 is one more than a multiple of 343. An equivalent formulation is the congruence        (      a  p        b  p      )   ≡    (     a      b     )      (   mod   p  3    )     .       binomial    a  p     b  p     annotated   binomial  a  b    pmod   superscript  p  3       {ap\choose bp}\equiv{a\choose b}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{3}).   The theorem was first proved by Joseph Wolstenholme in 1862. In 1819, Charles Babbage showed the same congruence modulo p 2 , which holds for all primes p (for p =2 only in the second formulation). The second formulation of Wolstenholme's theorem is due to J. W. L. Glaisher and is inspired by Lucas' theorem .  No known composite numbers satisfy Wolstenholme's theorem and it is conjectured that there are none (see below). A prime that satisfies the congruence modulo p 4 is called a Wolstenholme prime (see below).  As Wolstenholme himself established, his theorem can also be expressed as a pair of congruences for (generalized) harmonic numbers :      1  +   1  2   +   1  3   +  …  +   1   p  -  1    ≡  0   (   mod   p  2    )   , and     fragments  1     1  2      1  3    normal-…     1    p  1     0   pmod   superscript  p  2    , and    1+{1\over 2}+{1\over 3}+...+{1\over p-1}\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{2})%
 \mbox{, and}           1  +   1   2  2    +   1   3  2    +  …  +   1    (   p  -  1   )   2     ≡   0     (   mod  p   )     .        1    1   superscript  2  2      1   superscript  3  2    normal-…    1   superscript    p  1   2      annotated  0   pmod  p      1+{1\over 2^{2}}+{1\over 3^{2}}+...+{1\over(p-1)^{2}}\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm
 mod%
 }}p).   (Congruences with fractions make sense, provided that the denominators are coprime to the modulus.) For example, with p =7, the first of these says that the numerator of 49/20 is a multiple of 49, while the second says the numerator of 5369/3600 is a multiple of 7.  Wolstenholme primes  A prime p is called a Wolstenholme prime iff the following condition holds:        (       2  p   -  1        p  -  1      )   ≡   1     (   mod   p  4    )     .       binomial      2  p   1     p  1     annotated  1   pmod   superscript  p  4       {{2p-1}\choose{p-1}}\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{4}).     If p is a Wolstenholme prime , then Glaisher's theorem holds modulo p 4 . The only known Wolstenholme primes so far are 16843 and 2124679 ; any other Wolstenholme prime must be greater than 10 9 . 1 This result is consistent with the heuristic argument that the residue modulo  p 4 is a pseudo-random multiple of p 3 . This heuristic predicts that the number of Wolstenholme primes between K and N is roughly ln ln N − ln ln K . The Wolstenholme condition has been checked up to 10 9 , and the heuristic says that there should be roughly one Wolstenholme prime between 10 9 and 10 24 . A similar heuristic predicts that there are no "doubly Wolstenholme" primes, meaning that the congruence holds modulo p 5 .  A proof of the theorem  There is more than one way to prove Wolstenholme's theorem. Here is a proof that directly establishes Glaisher's version using both combinatorics and algebra.  For the moment let p be any prime, and let a and b be any non-negative integers. Then a set A with ap elements can be divided into a rings of length p , and the rings can be rotated separately. Thus, the cyclic group of order p a acts on the set A , and by extension it acts on the set of subsets of size bp . Every orbit of this group action has p k elements, where k is the number of incomplete rings, i.e., if there are k rings that only partly intersect a subset B in the orbit. There are    (      a      b      )     binomial  a  b    \textstyle{a\choose b}   orbits of size 1 and there are no orbits of size p . Thus we first obtain Babbage's theorem        (      a  p        b  p      )   ≡    (     a      b     )      (   mod   p  2    )     .       binomial    a  p     b  p     annotated   binomial  a  b    pmod   superscript  p  2       {ap\choose bp}\equiv{a\choose b}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{2}).   Examining the orbits of size p 2 , we also obtain        (      a  p        b  p      )   ≡     (     a      b     )   +    (     a      2     )    (    (      2  p       p     )   -  2   )    (      a  -  2        b  -  1      )        (   mod   p  3    )     .       binomial    a  p     b  p     annotated     binomial  a  b      binomial  a  2      binomial    2  p   p   2    binomial    a  2     b  1       pmod   superscript  p  3       {ap\choose bp}\equiv{a\choose b}+{a\choose 2}\left({2p\choose p}-2\right){a-2%
 \choose b-1}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{3}).   Among other consequences, this equation tells us that the case a=2 and b=1 implies the general case of the second form of Wolstenholme's theorem.  Switching from combinatorics to algebra, both sides of this congruence are polynomials in a for each fixed value of b . The congruence therefore holds when a is any integer, positive or negative, provided that b is a fixed positive integer. In particular, if a=-1 and b=1 , the congruence becomes        (      -  p       p     )   ≡     (      -  1       1     )   +    (      -  1       2     )    (    (      2  p       p     )   -  2   )        (   mod   p  3    )     .       binomial    p   p    annotated     binomial    1   1      binomial    1   2      binomial    2  p   p   2      pmod   superscript  p  3       {-p\choose p}\equiv{-1\choose 1}+{-1\choose 2}\left({2p\choose p}-2\right)\;\;%
 (\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{3}).   This congruence becomes an equation for    (       2  p       p      )     binomial    2  p   p    \textstyle{2p\choose p}   using the relation        (      -  p       p     )   =      (   -  1   )   p   2    (      2  p       p     )     .       binomial    p   p        superscript    1   p   2    binomial    2  p   p      {-p\choose p}=\frac{(-1)^{p}}{2}{2p\choose p}.   When p is odd, the relation is        3   (      2  p       p     )    ≡   6     (   mod   p  3    )     .        3   binomial    2  p   p     annotated  6   pmod   superscript  p  3       3{2p\choose p}\equiv 6\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{3}).   When p ≠3, we can divide both sides by 3 to complete the argument.  A similar derivation modulo p 4 establishes that       (      a  p        b  p      )   ≡    (     a      b     )      (   mod   p  4    )         binomial    a  p     b  p     annotated   binomial  a  b    pmod   superscript  p  4       {ap\choose bp}\equiv{a\choose b}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{4})   for all positive a and b if and only if it holds when a=2 and b=1 , i.e., if and only if p is a Wolstenholme prime.  The converse as a conjecture  It is conjectured that if       (       2  n   -  1        n  -  1      )   ≡   1     (   mod   n  k    )         binomial      2  n   1     n  1     annotated  1   pmod   superscript  n  k       {2n-1\choose n-1}\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}n^{k})   (1) when k=3 , then n is prime. The conjecture can be understood by considering k = 1 and 2 as well as 3. When k = 1, Babbage's theorem implies that it holds for n = p 2 for p an odd prime, while Wolstenholme's theorem implies that it holds for n = p 3 for p > 3. When k = 2, it holds for n = p 2 if p is a Wolstenholme prime. These three numbers, 4 = 2 2 , 8 = 2 3 , and 27 = 3 3 are not hold for (1) with k = 1, but all other prime square and prime cube are hold for (1) with k = 1. Only 5 other composite values (not a prime square or a prime cube) of n are known to hold for (1) with k = 1, they are called Wolstenholme pseudoprimes , they are   27173, 2001341, 16024189487, 80478114820849201, 20378551049298456998947681   The first three are not prime powers , the last two are 16843 4 and 2124679 4 , 16843 and 2124679 are Wolstenholme primes . Besides, with an exception of 16843 2 and 2124679 2 , no composites are known to hold for (1) with k = 2, much less k = 3. Thus the conjecture is considered likely because Wolstenholme's congruence seems over-constrained and artificial for composite numbers. Moreover, if the congruence does hold for any particular n other than a prime or prime power, and any particular k , it does not imply that        (      a  n        b  n      )   ≡    (     a      b     )      (   mod   n  k    )     .       binomial    a  n     b  n     annotated   binomial  a  b    pmod   superscript  n  k       {an\choose bn}\equiv{a\choose b}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}n^{k}).     Generalizations  Leudesdorf has proved that for a positive integer n coprime to 6, the following congruence holds: 2         ∑       i  =  1         (  i  ,  n  )   =  1        n  -  1     1  i    ≡   0     (   mod   n  2    )     .        superscript   subscript    STACKED    i  1      i  n   1       n  1      1  i     annotated  0   pmod   superscript  n  2       \sum_{i=1\atop(i,n)=1}^{n-1}\frac{1}{i}\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}n^{2}).
