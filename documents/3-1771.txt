Edge-transitive graph

In the mathematical field of graph theory, an edge-transitive graph is a graph G such that, given any two edges e1 and e2 of G, there is an automorphism of G that maps e1 to e2.1
In other words, a graph is edge-transitive if its automorphism group acts transitively upon its edges.
Examples and properties
(Figure)
The Gray graph is edge-transitive and regular, but not vertex-transitive.

Edge-transitive graphs include any complete bipartite graph

 
 , and any symmetric graph, such as the vertices and edges of the cube.2 Symmetric graphs are also vertex-transitive (if they are connected), but in general edge-transitive graphs need not be vertex-transitive. The Gray graph is an example of a graph which is edge-transitive but not vertex-transitive. All such graphs are bipartite,3 and hence can be colored with only two colors.
An edge-transitive graph that is also regular, but not vertex-transitive, is called semi-symmetric. The Gray graph again provides an example. Every edge-transitive graph that is not vertex-transitive must be bipartite and either semi-symmetric or biregular.4
