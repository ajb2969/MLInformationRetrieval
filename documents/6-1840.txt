   Reduced homology      Reduced homology   In mathematics , reduced homology is a minor modification made to homology theory in algebraic topology , designed to make a point have all its homology groups zero. This change is required to make statements without some number of exceptional cases ( Alexander duality being an example).  If P is a single-point space, then with the usual definitions the integral homology group   H 0 ( P )   is an infinite cyclic group , while for i ≥ 1 we have   H i ( P ) = {0}.   More generally if X is a simplicial complex or finite CW complex , then the group H 0 ( X ) is the free abelian group with the connected components of X as generators. The reduced homology should replace this group, of rank r say, by one of rank r − 1. Otherwise the homology groups should remain unchanged. An ad hoc way to do this is to think of a 0-th homology class not as a formal sum of connected components, but as such a formal sum where the coefficients add up to zero.  In the usual definition of homology of a space X , we consider the chain complex      ⋯   ⟶   ∂   n  +  1      C  n    ⟶   ∂  n     C   n  -  1     ⟶   ∂   n  -  1     ⋯   ⟶   ∂  2     C  1    ⟶   ∂  1     C  0    ⟶   ∂  0    0      normal-⋯    subscript     n  1    normal-⟶    subscript  C  n     subscript   n   normal-⟶    subscript  C    n  1      subscript     n  1    normal-⟶   normal-⋯    subscript   2   normal-⟶    subscript  C  1     subscript   1   normal-⟶    subscript  C  0     subscript   0   normal-⟶   0    \cdots\overset{\partial_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow\,}C_{n}\overset{\partial_{n}}{%

 \longrightarrow\,}C_{0}\overset{\partial_{0}}{\longrightarrow\,}0     and define the homology groups by      H  n    (  X  )    =     ker   ∂  n    /  im    (   ∂   n  +  1    )           subscript  H  n   X         kernel   subscript   n    im    subscript     n  1       H_{n}(X)=\ker\partial_{n}/\mathrm{im}(\partial_{n+1})   .  To define reduced homology, we start with the augmented chain complex       ⋯   ⟶   ∂   n  +  1      C  n    ⟶   ∂  n     C   n  -  1     ⟶   ∂   n  -  1     ⋯   ⟶   ∂  2     C  1    ⟶   ∂  1     C  0    ⟶  ϵ   ℤ   →  0     normal-→    normal-⋯    subscript     n  1    normal-⟶    subscript  C  n     subscript   n   normal-⟶    subscript  C    n  1      subscript     n  1    normal-⟶   normal-⋯    subscript   2   normal-⟶    subscript  C  1     subscript   1   normal-⟶    subscript  C  0    ϵ  normal-⟶   ℤ   0    \cdots\overset{\partial_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow\,}C_{n}\overset{\partial_{n}}{%
 \longrightarrow\,}C_{n-1}\overset{\partial_{n-1}}{\longrightarrow\,}\cdots%

 \longrightarrow\,}C_{0}\overset{\epsilon}{\longrightarrow\,}\mathbb{Z}\to 0     where     ϵ   (    ∑  i     n  i    σ  i     )    =    ∑  i    n  i          ϵ    subscript   i      subscript  n  i    subscript  σ  i        subscript   i    subscript  n  i      \epsilon\left(\sum_{i}n_{i}\sigma_{i}\right)=\sum_{i}n_{i}   . Now we define the reduced homology groups by         H  n   ~    (  X  )    =     ker   (   ∂  n   )    /  im    (   ∂   n  +  1    )           normal-~   subscript  H  n    X        kernel   subscript   n    im    subscript     n  1       \tilde{H_{n}}(X)=\ker(\partial_{n})/\mathrm{im}(\partial_{n+1})   for positive n and       H  ~   0    (  X  )    =     ker   (  ϵ  )    /  im    (   ∂  1   )           subscript   normal-~  H   0   X        kernel  ϵ   im    subscript   1      \tilde{H}_{0}(X)=\ker(\epsilon)/\mathrm{im}(\partial_{1})   .  One can show that      H  0    (  X  )    =      H  ~   0    (  X  )    ⊕  ℤ          subscript  H  0   X    direct-sum     subscript   normal-~  H   0   X   ℤ     H_{0}(X)=\tilde{H}_{0}(X)\oplus\mathbb{Z}   ; evidently      H  n    (  X  )    =     H  ~   n    (  X  )           subscript  H  n   X      subscript   normal-~  H   n   X     H_{n}(X)=\tilde{H}_{n}(X)   for all positive n .  Armed with this modified complex, the standard ways to obtain homology with coefficients by applying the tensor product , or reduced  cohomology groups from the cochain complex made by using a Hom functor , can be applied.
