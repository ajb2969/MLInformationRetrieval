   Tightness of measures      Tightness of measures   In mathematics , tightness is a concept in measure theory . The intuitive idea is that a given collection of measures does not "escape to infinity ."  Definitions  Let ( X , T ) be a topological space , and let Σ be a σ-algebra on X that contains the topology T . (Thus, every open subset of X is a measurable set and Σ is at least as fine as the Borel σ-algebra on X .) Let M be a collection of (possibly signed or complex ) measures defined on Σ. The collection M is called tight (or sometimes uniformly tight ) if, for any ε > 0, there is a compact subset  K ε of X such that, for all measures μ in M ,         |  μ  |    (   X  ∖   K  ε    )    <  ε   .          μ     X   subscript  K  ε     ε    |\mu|(X\setminus K_{\varepsilon})<\varepsilon.     where    |  μ  |      μ    |\mu|   is the total variation measure of   μ   μ   \mu   . Very often, the measures in question are probability measures , so the last part can be written as        μ   (   K  ε   )    >   1  -  ε    .        μ   subscript  K  ε      1  ε     \mu(K_{\varepsilon})>1-\varepsilon.\,     If a tight collection M consists of a single measure μ , then (depending upon the author) μ may either be said to be a tight measure or to be an inner regular measure .  If Y is an X -valued random variable whose probability distribution on X is a tight measure then Y is said to be a separable random variable or a Radon random variable .  Examples  Compact spaces  If X is a metrisable  compact space , then every collection of (possibly complex) measures on X is tight. This is not necessarily so for non-metrisable compact spaces. If we take    [  0  ,   ω  1   ]     0   subscript  ω  1     [0,\omega_{1}]   with its order topology , then there exists a measure   μ   μ   \mu   on it that is not inner regular. Therefore the singleton    {  μ  }     μ    \{\mu\}   is not tight.  Polish spaces  If X is a Polish space , then every probability measure on X is tight. Furthermore, by Prokhorov's theorem , a collection of probability measures on X is tight if and only if it is precompact in the topology of weak convergence .  A collection of point masses  Consider the real line  R with its usual Borel topology. Let δ x denote the Dirac measure , a unit mass at the point x in R . The collection       M  1   :=   {   δ  n   |   n  ∈  ℕ   }      assign   subscript  M  1    conditional-set   subscript  δ  n     n  ℕ      M_{1}:=\{\delta_{n}|n\in\mathbb{N}\}     is not tight, since the compact subsets of R are precisely the closed and bounded subsets, and any such set, since it is bounded, has δ n -measure zero for large enough n . On the other hand, the collection       M  2   :=   {   δ   1  /  n    |   n  ∈  ℕ   }      assign   subscript  M  2    conditional-set   subscript  δ    1  n      n  ℕ      M_{2}:=\{\delta_{1/n}|n\in\mathbb{N}\}     is tight: the compact interval [0, 1] will work as K η for any η > 0. In general, a collection of Dirac delta measures on R n is tight if, and only if, the collection of their supports is bounded.  A collection of Gaussian measures  Consider n -dimensional Euclidean space  R n with its usual Borel topology and σ-algebra. Consider a collection of Gaussian measures       Γ  =   {   γ  i   |   i  ∈  I   }    ,      normal-Γ   conditional-set   subscript  γ  i     i  I      \Gamma=\{\gamma_{i}|i\in I\},     where the measure γ i has expected value ( mean ) μ i in R n and variance  σ i 2 > 0. Then the collection Γ is tight if, and only if, the collections     {   μ  i   |   i  ∈  I   }   ⊆   ℝ  n        conditional-set   subscript  μ  i     i  I     superscript  ℝ  n     \{\mu_{i}|i\in I\}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}   and     {   σ  i  2   |   i  ∈  I   }   ⊆  ℝ       conditional-set   superscript   subscript  σ  i   2     i  I    ℝ    \{\sigma_{i}^{2}|i\in I\}\subseteq\mathbb{R}   are both bounded.  Tightness and convergence  Tightness is often a necessary criterion for proving the weak convergence of a sequence of probability measures, especially when the measure space has infinite  dimension .

A family of probability measures ( μ δ ) δ >0 on a Hausdorff topological space X is said to be exponentially tight if, for any η > 0, there is a compact subset K η of X such that         lim sup   δ  ↓  0     δ   log   μ  δ     (   X  ∖   K  η    )     <   -  η    .        subscript  limit-supremum   normal-↓  δ  0      δ     subscript  μ  δ      X   subscript  K  η        η     \limsup_{\delta\downarrow 0}\delta\log\mu_{\delta}(X\setminus K_{\eta})<-\eta.
