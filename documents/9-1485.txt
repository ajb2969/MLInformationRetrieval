   Expectation value (quantum mechanics)      Expectation value (quantum mechanics)   In quantum mechanics , the expectation value is the probabilistic expected value of the result (measurement) of an experiment. It is not the most probable value of a measurement; indeed the expectation value may have zero probability of occurring. It is a fundamental concept in all areas of quantum physics .  Operational definition  Formalism in quantum mechanics  In quantum theory, an experimental setup is described by the observable    A   A   A   to be measured, and the state    σ   σ   \sigma   of the system. The expectation value of   A   A   A   in the state   σ   σ   \sigma   is denoted as     ⟨  A  ⟩   σ     subscript   delimited-⟨⟩  A   σ    \langle A\rangle_{\sigma}   .  Mathematically,   A   A   A   is a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space . In the most commonly used case in quantum mechanics,   σ   σ   \sigma   is a pure state , described by a normalized 1 vector   ψ   ψ   \psi   in the Hilbert space. The expectation value of   A   A   A   in the state   ψ   ψ   \psi   is defined as  (1)      ⟨  A  ⟩   ψ   =   ⟨  ψ  |  A  |  ψ  ⟩        subscript   delimited-⟨⟩  A   ψ    quantum-operator-product  ψ  A  ψ     \langle A\rangle_{\psi}=\langle\psi|A|\psi\rangle   .  If dynamics is considered, either the vector   ψ   ψ   \psi   or the operator   A   A   A   is taken to be time-dependent, depending on whether the Schrödinger picture or Heisenberg picture is used. The evolution of the expectation value does not depend on this choice, however.  If   A   A   A   has a complete set of eigenvectors     ϕ  j     subscript  ϕ  j    \phi_{j}   , with eigenvalues     a  j     subscript  a  j    a_{j}   , then (1) can be expressed as  (2)      ⟨  A  ⟩   ψ   =    ∑  j     a  j     |   ⟨  ψ  |   ϕ  j   ⟩   |   2          subscript   delimited-⟨⟩  A   ψ     subscript   j      subscript  a  j    superscript     inner-product  ψ   subscript  ϕ  j     2       \langle A\rangle_{\psi}=\sum_{j}a_{j}|\langle\psi|\phi_{j}\rangle|^{2}   .  This expression is similar to the arithmetic mean , and illustrates the physical meaning of the mathematical formalism: The eigenvalues    a  j     subscript  a  j    a_{j}   are the possible outcomes of the experiment, 2 and their corresponding coefficient     |   ⟨  ψ  |   ϕ  j   ⟩   |   2     superscript     inner-product  ψ   subscript  ϕ  j     2    |\langle\psi|\phi_{j}\rangle|^{2}   is the probability that this outcome will occur; it is often called the transition probability .  A particularly simple case arises when   A   A   A   is a projection , and thus has only the eigenvalues 0 and 1. This physically corresponds to a "yes-no" type of experiment. In this case, the expectation value is the probability that the experiment results in "1", and it can be computed as  (3)      ⟨  A  ⟩   ψ   =    ∥   A  ψ   ∥   2        subscript   delimited-⟨⟩  A   ψ    superscript   norm    A  ψ    2     \langle A\rangle_{\psi}=\|A\psi\|^{2}   .  In quantum theory, also operators with non-discrete spectrum are in use, such as the position operator    Q   Q   Q   in quantum mechanics. This operator does not have eigenvalues , but has a completely continuous spectrum . In this case, the vector   ψ   ψ   \psi   can be written as a complex-valued function    ψ   (  x  )       ψ  x    \psi(x)   on the spectrum of   Q   Q   Q   (usually the real line). For the expectation value of the position operator, one then has the formula  (4)      ⟨  Q  ⟩   ψ   =     ∫   -  ∞   ∞      x      |   ψ   (  x  )    |   2    d  x         subscript   delimited-⟨⟩  Q   ψ     superscript   subscript            x   superscript      ψ  x    2   d  x      \langle Q\rangle_{\psi}=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\,x\,|\psi(x)|^{2}\,dx   .  A similar formula holds for the momentum operator    P   P   P   , in systems where it has continuous spectrum.  All the above formulas are valid for pure states   σ   σ   \sigma   only. Prominently in thermodynamics , also mixed states are of importance; these are described by a positive trace-class operator    ρ  =    ∑  i     ρ  i    |   ψ  i   ⟩    ⟨   ψ  i   |         ρ    subscript   i      subscript  ρ  i    ket   subscript  ψ  i     bra   subscript  ψ  i        \rho=\sum_{i}\rho_{i}|\psi_{i}\rangle\langle\psi_{i}|   , the statistical operator or density matrix . The expectation value then can be obtained as  (5)      ⟨  A  ⟩   ρ   =   Trace   (   ρ  A   )    =    ∑  i     ρ  i    ⟨   ψ  i   |  A  |   ψ  i   ⟩     =    ∑  i     ρ  i     ⟨  A  ⟩    ψ  i             subscript   delimited-⟨⟩  A   ρ     Trace    ρ  A           subscript   i      subscript  ρ  i    quantum-operator-product   subscript  ψ  i   A   subscript  ψ  i             subscript   i      subscript  ρ  i    subscript   delimited-⟨⟩  A    subscript  ψ  i         \langle A\rangle_{\rho}=\mathrm{Trace}(\rho A)=\sum_{i}\rho_{i}\langle\psi_{i}%
 |A|\psi_{i}\rangle=\sum_{i}\rho_{i}\langle A\rangle_{\psi_{i}}   .  General formulation  In general, quantum states   σ   σ   \sigma   are described by positive normalized linear functionals on the set of observables, mathematically often taken to be a C* algebra . The expectation value of an observable   A   A   A   is then given by  (6)      ⟨  A  ⟩   σ   =   σ   (  A  )         subscript   delimited-⟨⟩  A   σ     σ  A     \langle A\rangle_{\sigma}=\sigma(A)   .  If the algebra of observables acts irreducibly on a Hilbert space , and if   σ   σ   \sigma   is a normal functional , that is, it is continuous in the ultraweak topology , then it can be written as      σ   (  ⋅  )   =  Trace   (   ρ   ⋅  )      fragments  σ   fragments  normal-(  normal-⋅  normal-)    Trace   fragments  normal-(  ρ  normal-⋅  normal-)     \sigma(\cdot)=\mathrm{Trace}(\rho\;\cdot)     with a positive trace-class operator   ρ   ρ   \rho   of trace 1. This gives formula (5) above. In the case of a pure state ,    ρ  =    |  ψ  ⟩    ⟨  ψ  |        ρ     ket  ψ    bra  ψ      \rho=|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|   is a projection onto a unit vector   ψ   ψ   \psi   . Then    σ  =   ⟨  ψ  |  ⋅  ψ  ⟩      fragments  σ    fragments  normal-⟨  ψ  normal-|  normal-⋅  ψ  normal-⟩     \sigma=\langle\psi|\cdot\;\psi\rangle   , which gives formula (1) above.     A   A   A   is assumed to be a self-adjoint operator. In the general case, its spectrum will neither be entirely discrete nor entirely continuous. Still, one can write   A   A   A   in a spectral decomposition ,      A  =   ∫    a   d  P   (  a  )         A      a  normal-d  P  a      A=\int a\,\mathrm{d}P(a)     with a projector-valued measure   P   P   P   . For the expectation value of   A   A   A   in a pure state    σ  =   ⟨  ψ  |  ⋅  ψ  ⟩      fragments  σ    fragments  normal-⟨  ψ  normal-|  normal-⋅  ψ  normal-⟩     \sigma=\langle\psi|\cdot\,\psi\rangle   , this means        ⟨  A  ⟩   σ   =   ∫    a   d   ⟨  ψ  |   P   (  a  )   ψ   ⟩          subscript   delimited-⟨⟩  A   σ       a  normal-d   inner-product  ψ    P  a  ψ        \langle A\rangle_{\sigma}=\int a\;\mathrm{d}\langle\psi|P(a)\psi\rangle   ,  which may be seen as a common generalization of formulas (2) and (4) above.  In non-relativistic theories of finitely many particles (quantum mechanics, in the strict sense), the states considered are generally normal. However, in other areas of quantum theory, also non-normal states are in use: They appear, for example. in the form of KMS states in quantum statistical mechanics of infinitely extended media, 3 and as charged states in quantum field theory . 4 In these cases, the expectation value is determined only by the more general formula (6).  Example in configuration space  As an example, let us consider a quantum mechanical particle in one spatial dimension, in the configuration space representation. Here the Hilbert space is    ℋ  =    L  2    (  ℝ  )        ℋ     superscript  L  2   ℝ     \mathcal{H}=L^{2}(\mathbb{R})   , the space of square-integrable functions on the real line. Vectors    ψ  ∈  ℋ      ψ  ℋ    \psi\in\mathcal{H}   are represented by functions    ψ   (  x  )       ψ  x    \psi(x)   , called wave functions . The scalar product is given by     ⟨   ψ  1   |   ψ  2   ⟩   =   ∫    ψ  1  ∗    (  x  )    ψ  2    (  x  )   d  x         inner-product   subscript  ψ  1    subscript  ψ  2         superscript   subscript  ψ  1   normal-∗   x   subscript  ψ  2   x  normal-d  x      \langle\psi_{1}|\psi_{2}\rangle=\int\psi_{1}^{\ast}(x)\psi_{2}(x)\,\mathrm{d}x   . The wave functions have a direct interpretation as a probability distribution:       p   (  x  )   d  x   =    ψ  *    (  x  )   ψ   (  x  )   d  x         p  x  d  x      superscript  ψ    x  ψ  x  d  x     p(x)dx=\psi^{*}(x)\psi(x)dx     gives the probability of finding the particle in an infinitesimal interval of length    d  x      d  x    dx   about some point   x   x   x   .  As an observable, consider the position operator   Q   Q   Q   , which acts on wavefunctions   ψ   ψ   \psi   by        (   Q  ψ   )    (  x  )    =   x  ψ   (  x  )            Q  ψ   x     x  ψ  x     (Q\psi)(x)=x\psi(x)   .  The expectation value, or mean value of measurements, of   Q   Q   Q   performed on a very large number of identical independent systems will be given by        ⟨  Q  ⟩   ψ   =   ⟨  ψ  |   Q  ψ   ⟩   =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞     ψ  ∗    (  x  )    x   ψ   (  x  )   d  x    =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞     x   p   (  x  )   d  x           subscript   delimited-⟨⟩  Q   ψ    inner-product  ψ    Q  ψ           superscript   subscript             superscript  ψ  normal-∗   x  x  ψ  x  normal-d  x           superscript   subscript            x  p  x  normal-d  x       \langle Q\rangle_{\psi}=\langle\psi|Q\psi\rangle=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\psi^{%
 \ast}(x)\,x\,\psi(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x\,p(x)\,\mathrm{d}x   .  The expectation value only exists if the integral converges, which is not the case for all vectors   ψ   ψ   \psi   . This is because the position operator is unbounded , and   ψ   ψ   \psi   has to be chosen from its domain of definition .  In general, the expectation of any observable can be calculated by replacing   Q   Q   Q   with the appropriate operator. For example, to calculate the average momentum, one uses the momentum operator in configuration space ,    P  =   -     i   ℏ   d   /  d   x        P          i  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  d   d   x      P=-i\hbar\,d/dx   . Explicitly, its expectation value is        ⟨  P  ⟩   ψ   =   -   i  ℏ    ∫   -  ∞   ∞     ψ  ∗    (  x  )      d  ψ   (  x  )     d  x     d  x           subscript   delimited-⟨⟩  P   ψ       i  Planck-constant-over-2-pi    superscript   subscript             superscript  ψ  normal-∗   x      d  ψ  x     d  x    normal-d  x        \langle P\rangle_{\psi}=-i\hbar\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\psi^{\ast}(x)\,\frac{d%
 \psi(x)}{dx}\,\mathrm{d}x   .  Not all operators in general provide a measureable value. An operator that has a pure real expectation value is called an observable and its value can be directly measured in experiment.
