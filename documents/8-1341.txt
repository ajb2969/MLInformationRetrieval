   Differential calculus over commutative algebras      Differential calculus over commutative algebras   In mathematics the differential calculus over commutative algebras is a part of commutative algebra based on the observation that most concepts known from classical differential calculus can be formulated in purely algebraic terms. Instances of this are:   The whole topological information of a smooth manifold    M   M   M   is encoded in the algebraic properties of its   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   - algebra of smooth functions     A  =    C  ∞    (  M  )     ,      A     superscript  C    M     A=C^{\infty}(M),   as in the Banach–Stone theorem .  Vector bundles over   M   M   M   correspond to projective finitely generated modules over   A   A   A   , via the functor    Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   which associates to a vector bundle its module of sections.  Vector fields on   M   M   M   are naturally identified with derivations of the algebra   A   A   A   .  More generally, a linear differential operator of order k, sending sections of a vector bundle    E  →  M     normal-→  E  M    E\rightarrow M   to sections of another bundle    F  →  M     normal-→  F  M    F\rightarrow M   is seen to be an   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   -linear map    Δ  :    Γ   (  E  )    →   Γ   (  F  )        normal-:  normal-Δ   normal-→    normal-Γ  E     normal-Γ  F      \Delta:\Gamma(E)\rightarrow\Gamma(F)   between the associated modules, such that for any k + 1 elements      f  0   ,  …  ,   f  k    ∈  A        subscript  f  0   normal-…   subscript  f  k    A    f_{0},\ldots,f_{k}\in A   :       [   f  k    [   f   k  -  1     [  ⋯   [   f  0   ,  Δ  ]   ⋯  ]   ]   =  0     fragments  normal-[   subscript  f  k    fragments  normal-[   subscript  f    k  1     fragments  normal-[  normal-⋯   fragments  normal-[   subscript  f  0   normal-,  Δ  normal-]   normal-⋯  normal-]   normal-]    0    [f_{k}[f_{k-1}[\cdots[f_{0},\Delta]\cdots]]=0     where the bracket     [  f  ,  Δ  ]   :    Γ   (  E  )    →   Γ   (  F  )        normal-:   f  normal-Δ    normal-→    normal-Γ  E     normal-Γ  F      [f,\Delta]:\Gamma(E)\rightarrow\Gamma(F)   is defined as the commutator         [  f  ,  Δ  ]    (  s  )    =    Δ   (   f  ⋅  s   )    -    f  ⋅  Δ    (  s  )      .         f  normal-Δ   s       normal-Δ   normal-⋅  f  s       normal-⋅  f  normal-Δ   s      [f,\Delta](s)=\Delta(f\cdot s)-f\cdot\Delta(s).     Denoting the set of k th order linear differential operators from an   A   A   A   -module   P   P   P   to an   A   A   A   -module   Q   Q   Q   with     Diff  k    (  P  ,  Q  )        subscript  Diff  k    P  Q     \mathrm{Diff}_{k}(P,Q)   we obtain a bi-functor with values in the category of   A   A   A   -modules. Other natural concepts of calculus such as jet spaces , differential forms are then obtained as representing objects of the functors    Diff  k     subscript  Diff  k    \mathrm{Diff}_{k}   and related functors.  Seen from this point of view calculus may in fact be understood as the theory of these functors and their representing objects.  Replacing the real numbers   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   with any commutative ring , and the algebra     C  ∞    (  M  )        superscript  C    M    C^{\infty}(M)   with any commutative algebra the above said remains meaningful, hence differential calculus can be developed for arbitrary commutative algebras. Many of these concepts are widely used in algebraic geometry , differential geometry and secondary calculus . Moreover the theory generalizes naturally to the setting of graded commutative algebra , allowing for a natural foundation of calculus on supermanifolds , graded manifolds and associated concepts like the Berezin integral .
