   Draft:Lie's formula      Draft:Lie's formula   Lie's formula , due to Sophus Lie (1888), says: if   p   p   p   is a point on a real or complex analytic manifold   M   M   M   ,   X   X   X   is a analytic vector field ,   φ   φ   φ   an analytic function, then       φ   (   exp   (   t  X   )   p   )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞      t  k    k  !     X  k   φ   (  p  )           φ    exp    t  X   p      superscript   subscript     k  0           superscript  t  k     k     superscript  X  k   φ  p      \varphi(\mathrm{exp}(tX)p)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{t^{k}}{k!}X^{k}\varphi(p)   where on the right X is viewed as a a first order differential operator operating on   φ   φ   φ   . In other words, it gives the Taylor series of   φ   φ   φ   along one-parameter subgroup.  Here   X   X   X   is an analytic vector field, and    e  x  p      e  x  p    exp   is the flow of   X   X   X   , and   τ   τ   τ   is the "time" of the flow. Its proof depends on   φ   φ   φ   having a Taylor series. In a smooth manifold setting, the exponential mapping is simply defined to be the time one flow of a (left invariant) smooth vector field without the strong motivational point of the power series for its name.  On the left hand side,      exp   (   τ  X   )       exp    τ  X     \mathrm{exp}(\tau X)   is, for each    τ  ∈  𝐑      τ  normal-∈  𝐑    τ∈\mathbf{R}   , a bi-analytic bijection (the analytic counterpart of diffeomorphism ) from the analytic manifold (the Lie group) to itself. Thus      exp   (   τ  X   )   p      exp    τ  X   p    \mathrm{exp}(\tau X)p   is a new point on the manifold. When   τ   τ   τ   varies (   p   p   p   fixed), an integral curve of   X   X   X   is obtained. With   p   p   p   = the identity,      exp   (   τ  X   )       exp    τ  X     \mathrm{exp}(\tau X)   can be considered as a one-parameter subgroup as   τ   τ   τ   varies over all   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   (provided   X   X   X   is in the Lie algebra). All one-parameter subgroups of the Lie group are expressible as such for some   X   X   X   in the Lie algebra (the left-invariant vector fields ≃ tangent space at the identity). On the right hand side,   X   X   X   is to be thought of as . Every   X   X   X   in the Lie algebra can canonically be associated with such a differential operator on the whole Lie group. This extends the concept of a Taylor series globally and in a coordinate-independent way.  j function  It is the Jacobian of the exponential map .  See also: Kirillov's character formula ."
