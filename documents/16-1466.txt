Draft:Lie's formula

Lie's formula, due to Sophus Lie (1888), says: if 
 
 
 
  is a point on a real or complex analytic manifold 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a analytic vector field, 
 
 
 
  an analytic function, then


 
  where on the right X is viewed as a a first order differential operator operating on 
 
 
 
 . In other words, it gives the Taylor series of 
 
 
 
  along one-parameter subgroup.
Here 
 
 
 
  is an analytic vector field, and 
 
 
 
  is the flow of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the "time" of the flow. Its proof depends on 
 
 
 
  having a Taylor series. In a smooth manifold setting, the exponential mapping is simply defined to be the time one flow of a (left invariant) smooth vector field without the strong motivational point of the power series for its name.
On the left hand side,


 
  is, for each 
 
 
 
 , a bi-analytic bijection (the analytic counterpart of diffeomorphism) from the analytic manifold (the Lie group) to itself. Thus


 
  is a new point on the manifold. When 
 
 
 
  varies (
 
 
 
  fixed), an integral curve of 
 
 
 
  is obtained. With 
 
 
 
  = the identity,


 
  can be considered as a one-parameter subgroup as 
 
 
 
  varies over all 
 
 
 
  (provided 
 
 
 
  is in the Lie algebra). All one-parameter subgroups of the Lie group are expressible as such for some 
 
 
 
  in the Lie algebra (the left-invariant vector fields â‰ƒ tangent space at the identity). On the right hand side, 
 
 
 
  is to be thought of as . Every 
 
 
 
  in the Lie algebra can canonically be associated with such a differential operator on the whole Lie group. This extends the concept of a Taylor series globally and in a coordinate-independent way.
