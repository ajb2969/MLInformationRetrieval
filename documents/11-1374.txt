   Sucrose 6F-alpha-galactosyltransferase      Sucrose 6F-alpha-galactosyltransferase   In enzymology , a sucrose 6F-alpha-galactosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-galactose + sucrose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 6F-alpha-D-galactosylsucrose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-galactose and sucrose , whereas its two products are UDP and 6F-alpha-D-galactosylsucrose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-galactose:sucrose 6F-alpha-D-galactosyltransferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphogalactose-sucrose 6F-alpha-galactosyltransferase , UDPgalactose:sucrose 6fru-alpha-galactosyltransferase , and sucrose 6F-alpha-galactotransferase .
