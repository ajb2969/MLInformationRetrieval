Computational Diffie–Hellman assumption

The computational Diffie–Hellman (CDH assumption) is the assumption that a certain computational problem within a cyclic group is hard.
Consider a cyclic group G of order q. The CDH assumption states that, given



for a randomly chosen generator g and random



it is computationally intractable to compute the value



The security of many cryptosystems is based on the CDH assumption. Also, the confidentiality of ElGamal encryption is equivalent to the CDH assumption (though the semantic security of the scheme is based on the decisional Diffie–Hellman assumption).
The CDH assumption is related to the discrete logarithm assumption, which holds that computing the discrete logarithm of a value base a generator 
 
 
 
  is hard. If taking discrete logs in 
 
 
 
  were easy, then the CDH assumption would be false: given



one could efficiently compute 
 
 
 
  in the following way:

compute 
 
 
 
  by taking the discrete log of 
 
 
 
  to base 
 
 
 
 ;
compute 
 
 
 
  by exponentiation
 
 
 
 ;

It is an open problem to determine whether the discrete log assumption is equivalent to CDH, though in certain special cases this can be shown to be the case.
The CDH assumption is also related to the decisional Diffie–Hellman assumption (DDH), which holds that it is hard to distinguish tuples of the form 
 
 
 
  from random tuples. If computing 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  were easy, then one could detect DDH tuples trivially. It is believed that CDH is a weaker assumption than DDH: there are groups for which detecting DDH tuples is easy, but solving CDH problems is believed to be hard.
