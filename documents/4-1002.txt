   Landau's constants      Landau's constants   In complex analysis , a branch of mathematics, Landau's constants are certain mathematical constants that describe the behaviour of holomorphic functions defined on the unit disk . Consider the set F of all those holomorphic functions f on the unit disk for which        f  ′    (  0  )    =   1.          superscript  f  normal-′   0   1.    f^{\prime}(0)=1.\,     We define L f to be the radius of the largest disk contained in the image of f , and B f to be the radius of the largest disk that is the biholomorphic image of a subset of a unit disk.  Landau's constants are then defined as the infimum of L f or B f , where f is any holomorphic function or any injective holomorphic function on the unit disk with        f  ′    (  0  )    =   1.          superscript  f  normal-′   0   1.    f^{\prime}(0)=1.\,     The three resulting constants are abbreviated L , B , and A (for injective functions), respectively.  The exact values of L , B , and A are not known, but it is known that       0.4330  +   10   -  14     <  B  <  0.472          0.4330   superscript  10    14     B       0.472     0.4330+10^{-14}         0.5  <  L  ≤  0.5432589...        0.5  L       0.5432589...     0.5         0.5  <  A  ≤  0.7853        0.5  A       0.7853     0.5     See also   Table of selected mathematical constants   References     External links     "  Category:Complex analysis  Category:Mathematical constants  Category:Unsolved problems in mathematics
