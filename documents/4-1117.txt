Splitting theorem

The splitting theorem is a classical theorem in Riemannian geometry. It states that if a complete Riemannian manifold M with Ricci curvature



has a straight line, i.e., a geodesic γ such that



for all



then it is isometric to a product space



where 
 
 
 
  is a Riemannian manifold with



History
For the surfaces, the theorem was proved by Stephan Cohn-Vossen.1 Victor Andreevich Toponogov generalized it to manifolds with non-negative sectional curvature.2 Jeff Cheeger and Detlef Gromoll proved that non-negative Ricci curvature is sufficient.
Later the splitting theorem was extended to Lorentzian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature in the time-like directions.3 4 5
