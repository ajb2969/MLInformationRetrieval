   Splitting theorem      Splitting theorem   The splitting theorem is a classical theorem in Riemannian geometry . It states that if a complete Riemannian manifold  M with Ricci curvature       Ric   (  M  )    ≥  0        Ric  M   0    {\rm Ric}(M)\geq 0     has a straight line, i.e., a geodesic γ such that       d   (   γ   (  u  )    ,   γ   (  v  )    )    =   |   u  -  v   |         d     γ  u     γ  v         u  v      d(\gamma(u),\gamma(v))=|u-v|     for all        u  ,  v   ∈  ℝ   ,       u  v   ℝ    u,v\in\mathbb{R},     then it is isometric to a product space       ℝ  ×  L   ,      ℝ  L    \mathbb{R}\times L,     where   L   L   L   is a Riemannian manifold with       Ric   (  L  )    ≥  0.        Ric  L   0.    {\rm Ric}(L)\geq 0.     History  For the surfaces, the theorem was proved by Stephan Cohn-Vossen . 1  Victor Andreevich Toponogov generalized it to manifolds with non-negative sectional curvature . 2  Jeff Cheeger and Detlef Gromoll proved that non-negative Ricci curvature is sufficient.  Later the splitting theorem was extended to Lorentzian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature in the time-like directions. 3  4  5  References   Jeff Cheeger; Detlef Gromoll, The splitting theorem for manifolds of nonnegative Ricci curvature , Journal of Differential Geometry 6 (1971/72), 119–128.
