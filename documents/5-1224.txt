Diagonal intersection

Diagonal intersection is a term used in mathematics, especially in set theory.
If 
 
 
 
  is an ordinal number and 
 
 
 
  is a sequence of subsets of 
 
 
 
 , then the diagonal intersection, denoted by



is defined to be



That is, an ordinal

 
  is in the diagonal intersection 
 
 
 
  if and only if it is contained in the first 
 
 
 
  members of the sequence. This is the same as



where the closed interval from 0 to 
 
 
 
  is used to avoid restricting the range of the intersection.
