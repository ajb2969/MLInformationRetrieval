   Succinyl-CoA:(R)-benzylsuccinate CoA-transferase      Succinyl-CoA:(R)-benzylsuccinate CoA-transferase   In enzymology , a succinyl-CoA:(R)-benzylsuccinate CoA-transferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   succinyl-CoA + (R)-2-benzylsuccinate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   succinate + (R)-2-benzylsuccinyl-CoA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are succinyl-CoA and (R)-2-benzylsuccinate , whereas its two products are succinate and (R)-2-benzylsuccinyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the CoA-transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is succinyl-CoA:(R)-2-benzylsuccinate CoA-transferase . This enzyme is also called benzylsuccinate CoA-transferase . This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via coa ligation .
