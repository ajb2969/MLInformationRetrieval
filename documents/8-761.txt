Distributive category

In mathematics, a category is distributive if it has finite products and finite coproducts such that for every choice of objects 
 
 
 
 , the canonical map



is an isomorphism, and for all objects 
 
 
 
 , the canonical map 
 
 
 
 
  is an isomorphism. Equivalently. if for every object 
 
 
 
  the functor 
 
 
 
  preserves coproducts up to isomorphisms 
 
 
 
 .1 It follows that 
 
 
 
  and aforementioned canonical maps are equal for each choice of objects.
In particular, if the functor 
 
 
 
 
  has a right adjoint (i.e., if the category is cartesian closed), it necessarily preserves all colimits, and thus any cartesian closed category with finite coproducts (i.e., any bicartesian closed category) is distributive.
For example, Set is distributive, while Grp is not, even though it has both products and coproducts.
An even simpler category that has both products and coproducts but is not distributive is the category of pointed sets.2
