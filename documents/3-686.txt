   Legendre form      Legendre form   In mathematics , the Legendre forms of elliptic integrals are a canonical set of three elliptic integrals to which all others may be reduced. Legendre chose the name elliptic integrals because 1 the second kind gives the arc length of an ellipse of unit semi-minor axis and eccentricity    k   k   \scriptstyle{k}   (the ellipse being defined parametrically by    x  =     1  -   k  2      cos   (  t  )         x        1   superscript  k  2       t      \scriptstyle{x=\sqrt{1-k^{2}}\cos(t)}   ,    y  =   sin   (  t  )        y    t     \scriptstyle{y=\sin(t)}   ).  In modern times the Legendre forms have largely been supplanted by an alternative canonical set, the Carlson symmetric forms . A more detailed treatment of the Legendre forms is given in the main article on elliptic integrals .  Definition  The incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind is defined as,        F   (  ϕ  ,  k  )    =    ∫  0  ϕ     1    1  -    k  2     sin  2    (  t  )        d  t     ,        F   ϕ  k      superscript   subscript   0   ϕ       1      1     superscript  k  2     superscript   2   t       d  t      F(\phi,k)=\int_{0}^{\phi}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-k^{2}\sin^{2}(t)}}dt,     the second kind as        E   (  ϕ  ,  k  )    =    ∫  0  ϕ       1  -    k  2     sin  2    (  t  )        d  t     ,        E   ϕ  k      superscript   subscript   0   ϕ         1     superscript  k  2     superscript   2   t      d  t      E(\phi,k)=\int_{0}^{\phi}\sqrt{1-k^{2}\sin^{2}(t)}\,dt,     and the third kind as        Π   (  ϕ  ,  n  ,  k  )    =    ∫  0  ϕ      1    (   1  -   n    sin  2    (  t  )      )     1  -    k  2     sin  2    (  t  )          d  t     .        normal-Π   ϕ  n  k      superscript   subscript   0   ϕ       1      1    n    superscript   2   t         1     superscript  k  2     superscript   2   t        d  t      \Pi(\phi,n,k)=\int_{0}^{\phi}\frac{1}{(1-n\sin^{2}(t))\sqrt{1-k^{2}\sin^{2}(t)%
 }}\,dt.     The argument n of the third kind of integral is known as the characteristic , which in different notational conventions can appear as either the first, second or third argument of Π and furthermore is sometimes defined with the opposite sign. The argument order shown above is that of Gradshteyn and Ryzhik 2 as well as Numerical Recipes . 3 The choice of sign is that of Abramowitz and Stegun 4 as well as Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, 5 but corresponds to the    Π   (  ϕ  ,   -  n   ,  k  )       normal-Π   ϕ    n   k     \scriptstyle{\Pi(\phi,-n,k)}   of Numerical Recipes . 6  The respective complete elliptic integrals are obtained by setting the amplitude ,   ϕ   ϕ   \scriptstyle{\phi}   , the upper limit of the integrals, to    π  /  2      π  2    \scriptstyle{\pi/2}   .  The Legendre form of an elliptic curve is given by       y  2   =   x   (   x  -  1   )    (   x  -  λ   )         superscript  y  2     x    x  1     x  λ      y^{2}=x(x-1)(x-\lambda)     Numerical evaluation  The classic method of evaluation is by means of Landen 's transformations . Descending Landen transformation decreases the modulus    k   k   \scriptstyle{k}   towards zero, while increasing the amplitude   ϕ   ϕ   \scriptstyle{\phi}   . Conversely, ascending transformation increases the modulus towards unity, while decreasing the amplitude. In either limit of   k   k   \scriptstyle{k}   , zero or one, the integral is readily evaluated.  Most modern authors recommend evaluation in terms of the Carlson symmetric forms , for which there exist efficient, robust and relatively simple algorithms. This approach has been adopted by Boost C++ Libraries , GNU Scientific Library and Numerical Recipes . 7  References    See also   Carlson symmetric form   "  Category:Special functions     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
