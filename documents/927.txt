   Optical medium      Optical medium   An optical medium is material through which electromagnetic waves propagate. It is a form of transmission medium . The permittivity and permeability of the medium define how electromagnetic waves propagate in it. The medium has an intrinsic impedance , given by        η  =    E  x    H  y        η     subscript  E  x    subscript  H  y      \eta={E_{x}\over H_{y}}        where    E  x     subscript  E  x    E_{x}   and    H  y     subscript  H  y    H_{y}   are the electric field and magnetic field , respectively. In a region with no electrical conductivity , the expression simplifies to:         η  =     μ  ε      .      η      μ  ε      \eta=\sqrt{\mu\over\varepsilon}\ .        For example, in free space the intrinsic impedance is called the characteristic impedance of vacuum , denoted Z 0 , and          Z  0   =      μ  0    ε  0       .       subscript  Z  0        subscript  μ  0    subscript  ε  0       Z_{0}=\sqrt{\mu_{0}\over\varepsilon_{0}}\ .        Waves propagate through a medium with velocity     c  w   =   ν  λ        subscript  c  w     ν  λ     c_{w}=\nu\lambda   , where   ν   ν   \nu   is the frequency and   λ   λ   \lambda   is the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves. This equation also may be put in the form        c  w   =    ω  k     ,       subscript  c  w     ω  k     c_{w}={\omega\over k}\ ,   where   ω   ω   \omega   is the angular frequency of the wave and   k   k   k   is the wavenumber of the wave. In electrical engineering , the symbol   β   β   \beta   , called the phase constant , is often used instead of   k   k   k   .  The propagation velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space , an idealized standard reference state (like absolute zero for temperature), is conventionally denoted by c 0 : 1        c  0   =    1     ε  0    μ  0        ,       subscript  c  0     1       subscript  ε  0    subscript  μ  0        c_{0}={1\over\sqrt{\varepsilon_{0}\mu_{0}}}\ ,      where    ε  0     subscript  ε  0    \varepsilon_{0}   is the electric constant and     μ   0     subscript  μ  0    ~{}\mu_{0}   is the magnetic constant .
