   Polynucleotide 3'-phosphatase      Polynucleotide 3'-phosphatase   In enzymology , a polynucleotide 3'-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a 3'-phosphopolynucleotide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a polynucleotide + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphopolynucleotide and H 2 O , whereas its two products are polynucleotide and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is polynucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include 2'(3')-polynucleotidase , DNA 3'-phosphatase , deoxyribonucleate 3'-phosphatase , and 5'-polynucleotidekinase 3'-phosphatase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
