   Cellobiose epimerase      Cellobiose epimerase   In enzymology a cellobiose epimerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cellobiose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucosyl-D-mannose   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , cellobiose , and one product , D-glucosyl-D-mannose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on carbohydrates and their derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cellobiose 2-epimerase . Enzymes like these can produce a more rapid syndrome that can speed up the process of many life-threatening diseases such as Necrotizing Fasciitis .
