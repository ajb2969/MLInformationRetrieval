   Characteristic energy      Characteristic energy   In astrodynamics the characteristic energy (    C  3     subscript  C  3    C_{3}\,\!   ) is a measure of the excess specific energy over that required to just barely escape from a massive body. The units are length 2 time −2 , i.e. energy per mass .  Every object in a 2-body  ballistic trajectory has a constant specific orbital energy    ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   equal to the sum of its kinetic and potential energy:          1  2     v  2    -   μ  /  r    =   c  o  n  s  t  a  n  t   =     1  2     C  3                1  2    superscript  v  2      μ  r      c  o  n  s  t  a  n  t            1  2    subscript  C  3       \tfrac{1}{2}v^{2}-\mu/r=constant=\tfrac{1}{2}C_{3}     where    μ  =   G  M       μ    G  M     \mu=GM   is the standard gravitational parameter of the massive body with mass   M   M   M   and   r   r   r   is the radial distance from its center. As an object in an escape trajectory moves outward, its kinetic energy decreases as its potential energy (which is always negative) increases, maintaining a constant sum.  Characteristic energy can be computed as:       C  3   =   v  ∞  2        subscript  C  3    superscript   subscript  v    2     C_{3}=v_{\infty}^{2}\,\!   where    v  ∞     subscript  v     v_{\infty}   is the asymptotic  velocity at infinite distance. Note that, since the kinetic energy is     1  2   m   v  2         1  2   m   superscript  v  2     \tfrac{1}{2}mv^{2}   , C 3 is twice the specific orbital energy (   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   ) of the escaping object.  Non-escape trajectory  A spacecraft with insufficient energy to escape will remain in a closed orbit (unless it intersects the central body ) with:       C  3   <   0        subscript  C  3   0    C_{3}<0\,     Parabolic trajectory  A spacecraft leaving the central body on a parabolic trajectory has exactly the energy needed to escape and no more:       C  3   =   0        subscript  C  3   0    C_{3}=0\,     Hyperbolic trajectory  A spacecraft that is leaving the central body on a hyperbolic trajectory has more than enough energy to escape:       C  3   =    μ  a         subscript  C  3     μ  a     C_{3}={\mu\over{a}}\,   where       μ   =   G  M       μ    G  M     \mu\,=GM   is the standard gravitational parameter ,      a    a   a\,   is the semi-major axis of the orbit 's hyperbola .  Examples  MAVEN , a Mars -bound spacecraft, was launched into a heliocentric orbit with a characteristic energy of 12.2 km 2 sec −2 with respect to the Earth. 1  See also   Specific orbital energy  Orbit  Parabolic trajectory  Hyperbolic trajectory   References     Footnotes  "  Category:Astrodynamics  Category:Orbits  Category:Energy (physics)     Atlas V set to launch MAVEN on Mars mission, nasaspaceflight.com, 17 November 2013. ↩
