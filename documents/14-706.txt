   Kardar–Parisi–Zhang equation      Kardar–Parisi–Zhang equation   The Kardar–Parisi–Zhang (KPZ) equation 1 (named after its creators Mehran Kardar , Giorgio Parisi , and Yi-Cheng Zhang) is a non-linear stochastic partial differential equation . It describes the temporal change of the height    h   (   x  →   ,  t  )       h    normal-→  x   t     h(\vec{x},t)   at place    x  →     normal-→  x    \vec{x}   and time   t   t   t   . It is formally          ∂  h    (   x  →   ,  t  )     ∂  t    =    ν    ∇  2   h    +    λ  2     (   ∇  h   )   2    +   η   (   x  →   ,  t  )      ,            h     normal-→  x   t      t        ν    superscript  normal-∇  2   h        λ  2    superscript   normal-∇  h   2      η    normal-→  x   t       \frac{\partial h(\vec{x},t)}{\partial t}=\nu\nabla^{2}h+\frac{\lambda}{2}\left%
 (\nabla h\right)^{2}+\eta(\vec{x},t)\;,     where    η   (   x  →   ,  t  )       η    normal-→  x   t     \eta(\vec{x},t)   is white  Gaussian noise with average     ⟨   η   (   x  →   ,  t  )    ⟩   =  0       delimited-⟨⟩    η    normal-→  x   t     0    \langle\eta(\vec{x},t)\rangle=0   and second moment        ⟨   η   (   x  →   ,  t  )   η   (    x  →   ′   ,   t  ′   )    ⟩   =   2  D   δ  d    (    x  →   -    x  →   ′    )   δ   (   t  -   t  ′    )     .       delimited-⟨⟩    η    normal-→  x   t   η    superscript   normal-→  x   normal-′    superscript  t  normal-′        2  D   superscript  δ  d      normal-→  x    superscript   normal-→  x   normal-′    δ    t   superscript  t  normal-′       \langle\eta(\vec{x},t)\eta(\vec{x}^{\prime},t^{\prime})\rangle=2D\delta^{d}(%
 \vec{x}-\vec{x}^{\prime})\delta(t-t^{\prime}).      ν   ν   \nu   ,   λ   λ   \lambda   , and   D   D   D   are parameters of the model and   d   d   d   is the dimension. In one spatial dimension the KPZ equation corresponds to a stochastic version of the well known Burgers' equation , in a field    u   (  x  ,  t  )       u   x  t     u(x,t)   say, via the substitution    u  =   -     λ    ∂  h    /   ∂  x         u        λ    h      x       u=-\lambda\,\partial h/\partial x   .  By use of renormalization group techniques it has been conjectured that the KPZ equation is the field theory of many surface growth models, such as the Eden model , ballistic deposition, and the SOS model. A rigorous proof has been given by Bertini and Giacomin 2 in the case of the SOS model.  Many models in the field of interacting particle systems , such as the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process , also lie in the KPZ universality class. This class is characterised by models which, in one spatial dimension (1 + 1 dimension) have a roughness exponent α = 1/2, growth exponent β = 1/3 and dynamic exponent z = 3/2. In order to check if a growth model is within the KPZ class, one can calculate the width of the surface,    W   (  L  ,  t  )       W   L  t     W(L,t)   , defined as        W   (  L  ,  t  )    =    ⟨    1  L     ∫  0  L       (    h   (  x  ,  t  )    -    h  ¯    (  t  )     )   2    d  x     ⟩    1  /  2     ,        W   L  t     superscript   delimited-⟨⟩      1  L     superscript   subscript   0   L      superscript      h   x  t       normal-¯  h   t    2   d  x        1  2      W(L,t)=\left\langle\frac{1}{L}\int_{0}^{L}\big(h(x,t)-\bar{h}(t)\big)^{2}\,dx%
 \right\rangle^{1/2},     where     h  ¯    (  t  )        normal-¯  h   t    \bar{h}(t)   is the mean surface height at time t and L is the size of the system. For models within the KPZ class, the main properties of the surface    h   (  x  ,  t  )       h   x  t     h(x,t)   can be characterized by the Family – Vicsek scaling relation 3 of the roughness, where        W   (  L  ,  t  )    ≈    L  α   f   (   t  /   L  z    )     ,        W   L  t       superscript  L  α   f    t   superscript  L  z       W(L,t)\approx L^{\alpha}f(t/L^{z}),     with a scaling function    f   (  u  )       f  u    f(u)   satisfying       f   (  u  )    ∝   {      u  β       u   ≪  1       1      u   ≫  1          proportional-to    f  u    cases   superscript  u  β    much-less-than  u  1   1   much-greater-than  u  1      f(u)\propto\begin{cases}u^{\beta}&\ u\ll 1\\
 1&\ u\gg 1\end{cases}     Due to the nonlinearity in the equation and the presence of space-time white-noise, the mathematical study of the KPZ equation has proven to be quite challenging: indeed, even without the nonlinear term, the equation reduces to the stochastic heat equation, whose solution is not differentiable in the space variable but verifies a Hölder condition with exponent  \left(\nabla h\right)^2  is ill-defined in a classical sense. A breakthrough in the mathematical study of the KPZ equation was achieved by Martin Hairer , whose work on the KPZ equation 4 earned him the 2014 Fields Medal . Hairer and Quastel 5 have recently shown that equations of the type          ∂  h    (   x  →   ,  t  )     ∂  t    =    ν    ∇  2   h    +   P   (   ∇  h   )    +   η   (   x  →   ,  t  )      ,            h     normal-→  x   t      t        ν    superscript  normal-∇  2   h      P   normal-∇  h      η    normal-→  x   t       \frac{\partial h(\vec{x},t)}{\partial t}=\nu\nabla^{2}h+P\left(\nabla h\right)%
