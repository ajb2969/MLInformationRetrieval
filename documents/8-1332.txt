Duplication and elimination matrices

In mathematics, especially in linear algebra and matrix theory, the duplication matrix and the elimination matrix are linear transformations used for transforming half-vectorizations of matrices into vectorizations or (respectively) vice versa.
Duplication matrix
The duplication matrix Dn is the unique n2 × n(n+1)/2 matrix which, for any n × n symmetric matrix A, transforms vech(A) into vec(A):

Dn vech(A) = vec(A).
 

For the 2×2 symmetric matrix A = 
 
 
 
 , this transformation reads



Elimination matrix
The elimination matrix Ln is the unique n(n+1)/2 × n2 matrix which, for any n × n matrix A, transforms vec(A) into vech(A):

Ln vec(A) = vech(A). 1


For the 2×2 matrix A = 
 
 
 
 , this transformation reads
