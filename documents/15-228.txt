   Almost commutative ring      Almost commutative ring   In algebra , a filtered ring  A is said to be almost commutative if the associated graded ring     gr  A   =   ⊕    A  i   /   A   i  -  1           gr  A    direct-sum     subscript  A  i    subscript  A    i  1        \operatorname{gr}A=\oplus A_{i}/{A_{i-1}}   is commutative .  Basic examples of almost commutative rings involve differential operators. For example, the enveloping algebra of a complex Lie algebra is almost commutative by the PBW theorem . Similarly, a Weyl algebra is almost commutative.  See also   Ore condition  Gelfand–Kirillov dimension   References   Victor Ginzburg , Lectures on D-modules   "  Category:Ring theory
