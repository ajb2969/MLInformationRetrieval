Almost commutative ring

In algebra, a filtered ring A is said to be almost commutative if the associated graded ring 
 
 
 
  is commutative.
Basic examples of almost commutative rings involve differential operators. For example, the enveloping algebra of a complex Lie algebra is almost commutative by the PBW theorem. Similarly, a Weyl algebra is almost commutative.
