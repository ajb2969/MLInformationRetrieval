   Peptidyl-glutaminase      Peptidyl-glutaminase   In enzymology , a peptidyl-glutaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   alpha-N-peptidyl-L-glutamine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   alpha-N-peptidyl-L-glutamate + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are alpha-N-peptidyl-L-glutamine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are alpha-N-peptidyl-L-glutamate and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is peptidyl-L-glutamine amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include peptidoglutaminase I , peptideglutaminase , and peptidoglutaminase .
