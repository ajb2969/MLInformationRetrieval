   Utm theorem      Utm theorem   In computability theory the utm theorem , or Universal Turing machine theorem , is a basic result about Gödel numberings of the set of computable functions . It affirms the existence of a computable universal function , which is capable of calculating any other computable function. The universal function is an abstract version of the universal turing machine , thus the name of the theorem.  Rogers equivalence theorem provides a characterization of the Gödel numbering of the computable functions in terms of the smn theorem and the utm theorem.  utm theorem  Let     φ  1   ,   φ  2   ,   φ  3   ,  …      subscript  φ  1    subscript  φ  2    subscript  φ  3   normal-…    \varphi_{1},\varphi_{2},\varphi_{3},...   be an enumeration of Gödel numbers of computable functions. Then the partial function      u  :    ℕ  2   →  ℕ      normal-:  u   normal-→   superscript  ℕ  2   ℕ     u:\mathbb{N}^{2}\to\mathbb{N}   defined as        u   (  i  ,  x  )    :=     φ  i    (  x  )    i    ,   x  ∈  ℕ      formulae-sequence   assign    u   i  x        subscript  φ  i   x   i      x  ℕ     u(i,x):=\varphi_{i}(x)\qquad i,x\in\mathbb{N}   is computable.     u   u   u   is called the universal function .
