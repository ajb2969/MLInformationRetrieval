Cyclohexane-1,3-dione hydrolase




Cyclohexane-1,3-dione hydrolase

In enzymology, a cyclohexane-1,3-dione hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

cyclohexane-1,3-dione + H2O 
 
 
 
  5-oxohexanoate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cyclohexane-1,3-dione and H2O, whereas its product is 5-oxohexanoate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carbon-carbon bonds in ketonic substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cyclohexane-1,3-dione acylhydrolase (decyclizing). This enzyme is also called 1,3-cyclohexanedione hydrolase.
