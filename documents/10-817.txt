   Precorrin-6A synthase (deacetylating)      Precorrin-6A synthase (deacetylating)   In enzymology , a precorrin-6A synthase (deacetylating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + precorrin-5 + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + precorrin-6A + acetate   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine , precorrin 5 , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are S-adenosylhomocysteine , precorrin 6A , and acetate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:precorrin-5 C1-methyltransferase (deacetylating) . Other names in common use include precorrin-6X synthase (deacetylating) , and CobF . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism .
