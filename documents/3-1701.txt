Bell polynomials


In combinatorial mathematics, the Bell polynomials, named in honor of Eric Temple Bell, are a triangular array of polynomials given by






where the sum is taken over all sequences j1, j2, j3, ..., jn−k+1 of non-negative integers such that



Complete Bell polynomials
The sum



is sometimes called the nth complete Bell polynomial. In order to contrast them with complete Bell polynomials, the polynomials Bn,k are sometimes called partial or incomplete Bell polynomials.
The complete Bell polynomials satisfy the following identity



Combinatorial meaning
If the integer n is partitioned into a sum in which "1" appears j1 times, "2" appears j2 times, and so on, then the number of partitions of a set of size n that collapse to that partition of the integer n when the members of the set become indistinguishable is the corresponding coefficient in the polynomial.
Examples
For example, we have



because there are

6 ways to partition a set of 6 as 5 + 1,
 
15 ways to partition a set of 6 as 4 + 2, and
 
10 ways to partition a set of 6 as 3 + 3.
 

Similarly,



because there are

15 ways to partition a set of 6 as 4 + 1 + 1,
 
60 ways to partition a set of 6 as 3 + 2 + 1, and
 
15 ways to partition a set of 6 as 2 + 2 + 2.
 

Properties





Stirling numbers and Bell numbers
The value of the Bell polynomial Bn,k(x1,x2,...) on the sequence of factorials equals an unsigned Stirling number of the first kind:



The value of the Bell polynomial Bn,k(x1,x2,...) on the sequence of ones equals a Stirling number of the second kind:


 
  The sum of these values gives the value of the complete Bell polynomial on the sequence of ones:


 
  which is the nth Bell number.
Touchard polynomials
Touchard polynomial 
 
 
 
  can be expressed as the value of the complete Bell polynomial on all arguments being x:



Convolution identity
For sequences xn, yn, n = 1, 2, ..., define a sort of convolution by:


 
 .
Note that the bounds of summation are 1 and n − 1, not 0 and n .
Let 
 
 
 
  be the nth term of the sequence



Then



For example, let us compute 
 
 
 
 . We have









and thus,



Applications of Bell polynomials
Faà di Bruno's formula
Faà di Bruno's formula may be stated in terms of Bell polynomials as follows:



Similarly, a power-series version of Faà di Bruno's formula may be stated using Bell polynomials as follows. Suppose



Then



In particular, the complete Bell polynomials appear in the exponential of a formal power series:



Moments and cumulants
The sum



is the nth moment of a probability distribution whose first n cumulants are κ1, ..., κn. In other words, the nth moment is the nth complete Bell polynomial evaluated at the first n cumulants.
Representation of polynomial sequences of binomial type
For any sequence a1, a2, …, an of scalars, let



Then this polynomial sequence is of binomial type, i.e. it satisfies the binomial identity




Example: For a1 = … = an = 1, the polynomials 
 
 
 
  are called Touchard polynomials.
 

More generally, we have this result:

Theorem: All polynomial sequences of binomial type are of this form.
 

If we define a formal power series



then for all n,
