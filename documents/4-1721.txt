In probability theory, the Landau distribution1 is a probability distribution named after Lev Landau. Because of the distribution's long tail, the moments of the distribution, like mean or variance, are undefined. The distribution is a special case of the stable distribution.
Definition
The probability density function of a standard version of the Landau distribution is defined by the complex integral



where c is any positive real number, and log refers to the logarithm base e, the natural logarithm. The result does not change if c changes. For numerical purposes it is more convenient to use the following equivalent form of the integral,



The full family of Landau distributions is obtained by extending the standard distribution to a location-scale family. This distribution can be approximated by 23



This distribution is a special case of the stable distribution with parameters α = 1, and β = 1.4
The characteristic function may be expressed as:



where μ and c are real, which yields a Landau distribution shifted by μ and scaled by c.5
