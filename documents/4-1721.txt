   Landau distribution      Landau distribution   (Figure)  Landau distribution   In probability theory , the Landau distribution 1 is a probability distribution named after Lev Landau . Because of the distribution's long tail, the moments of the distribution, like mean or variance, are undefined. The distribution is a special case of the stable distribution .  Definition  The probability density function of a standard version of the Landau distribution is defined by the complex  integral        p   (  x  )    =    1   2  π  i       ∫   c  -   i  ∞     c  +   i  ∞         e    s   log  s    +   x  s      d  s      ,        p  x       1    2  π  i      superscript   subscript     c    i        c    i         superscript  e      s    s      x  s     d  s       p(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}\!e^{s\log s+xs}\,ds,     where c is any positive real number, and log refers to the logarithm base e , the natural logarithm . The result does not change if c changes. For numerical purposes it is more convenient to use the following equivalent form of the integral,        p   (  x  )    =    1  π      ∫  0  ∞      e    -   t   log  t     -   x  t      sin   (   π  t   )    d  t      .        p  x       1  π     superscript   subscript   0        superscript  e        t    t       x  t         π  t    d  t       p(x)=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!e^{-t\log t-xt}\sin(\pi t)\,dt.     The full family of Landau distributions is obtained by extending the standard distribution to a location-scale family . This distribution can be approximated by 2 3        p   (  x  )    =    1    2  π      exp   {   -    1  2    (   x  +   e   -  x     )     }      .        p  x       1      2  π             1  2     x   superscript  e    x           p(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2}(x+e^{-x})\right\}.     This distribution is a special case of the stable distribution with parameters α = 1, and β = 1. 4  The characteristic function may be expressed as:        φ   (  t  ;  μ  ,  c  )    =    exp    [    i  t  μ   -    |    c   t   |    (   1  +      2  i   π     log   (   |  t  |   )      )     ]     .        φ   t  μ  c          i  t  μ         c  t      1        2  i   π       t           \varphi(t;\mu,c)=\exp\!\Big[\;it\mu-|c\,t|(1+\tfrac{2i}{\pi}\log(|t|))\Big].     where μ and c are real, which yields a Landau distribution shifted by μ and scaled by c . 5  Related distributions   If    X  ∼   Landau   (  μ  ,  c  )       similar-to  X    Landau   μ  c      X\sim\textrm{Landau}(\mu,c)\,   then     X  +  m   ∼   Landau   (   μ  +  m   ,  c  )       similar-to    X  m     Landau     μ  m   c      X+m\sim\textrm{Landau}(\mu+m,c)\,     The Landau distribution is a stable distribution   References  "  Category:Continuous distributions  Category:Probability distributions with non-finite variance  Category:Power laws  Category:Stable distributions  Category:Probability distributions     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
