Distortion function

A distortion function

 
  is a non-decreasing function such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The dual distortion function is 
 
 
 
 
 .12 Distortion functions are used to define distortion risk measures.3
Given a probability space

 
 , then for any random variable

 
  and any distortion function 
 
 
 
  we can define a new probability measure

 
  such that for any 
 
 
 
 
  it follows that
