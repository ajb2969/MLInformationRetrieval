Regular embedding

In algebraic geometry, a closed immersion

 
  of schemes is a regular embedding of codimension r if each point x in X has an open affine neighborhood U in Y such that the ideal of 
 
 
 
  is generated by a regular sequence of length r.
For example, if X and Y are smooth over a scheme S and if i is an S-morphism, then i is a regular embedding. In particular, every section of a smooth morphism is a regular embedding.1 If 
 
 
 
  is regularly embedded into a regular scheme, then B is a complete intersection ring.2
The notion is used in an essential way in Fulton's approach to intersection theory. The important fact is that when i is a regular embedding, if I is the ideal sheaf of X in Y, then the normal sheaf, the dual of 
 
 
 
 
 , is locally free (thus a vector bundle) and the natural map 
 
 
 
  is an isomorphism: the normal cone

 
  coincides with the normal bundle.
A flat morphism of finite type 
 
 
 
  is called a (local) complete intersection morphism if each point x in X has an open affine neighborhood U so that f |U factors as 
 
 
 
  where j is a regular embedding and g is smooth.3 For example, if f is a morphism between smooth varieties, then f factors as 
 
 
 
 
  where the first map is the graph morphism and so is a complete intersection morphism.
