   Regular embedding      Regular embedding   In algebraic geometry , a closed immersion     i  :   X  ‚Ü™  Y      normal-:  i   normal-‚Ü™  X  Y     i:X\hookrightarrow Y   of schemes is a regular embedding of codimension r if each point x in X has an open affine neighborhood U in Y such that the ideal of    X  ‚à©  U      X  U    X\cap U   is generated by a regular sequence of length r .  For example, if X and Y are smooth over a scheme S and if i is an S -morphism, then i is a regular embedding. In particular, every section of a smooth morphism is a regular embedding. 1 If    Spec  B     Spec  B    \operatorname{Spec}B   is regularly embedded into a regular scheme , then B is a complete intersection ring . 2  The notion is used in an essential way in Fulton's approach to intersection theory . The important fact is that when i is a regular embedding, if I is the ideal sheaf of X in Y , then the normal sheaf , the dual of    I  /   I  2       I   superscript  I  2     I/I^{2}   , is locally free (thus a vector bundle) and the natural map     Sym   (   I  /   I  2    )    ‚Üí    ‚äï  0  ‚àû     I  n   /   I   n  +  1         normal-‚Üí   Sym    I   superscript  I  2       superscript   subscript  direct-sum  0        superscript  I  n    superscript  I    n  1        \operatorname{Sym}(I/I^{2})\to\oplus_{0}^{\infty}I^{n}/I^{n+1}   is an isomorphism: the normal cone     Spec   (    ‚äï  0  ‚àû     I  n   /   I   n  +  1      )      Spec    superscript   subscript  direct-sum  0        superscript  I  n    superscript  I    n  1        \operatorname{Spec}(\oplus_{0}^{\infty}I^{n}/I^{n+1})   coincides with the normal bundle.  A flat morphism of finite type    f  :   X  ‚Üí  Y      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  X  Y     f:X\to Y   is called a (local) complete intersection morphism if each point x in X has an open affine neighborhood U so that f | U factors as    U   ‚Üí  ùëó   V   ‚Üí  ùëî   Y      U   j  normal-‚Üí   V   g  normal-‚Üí   Y    U\overset{j}{\to}V\overset{g}{\to}Y   where j is a regular embedding and g is smooth . 3 For example, if f is a morphism between smooth varieties , then f factors as    X  ‚Üí   X  √ó  Y   ‚Üí  Y       normal-‚Üí  X    X  Y     normal-‚Üí    Y     X\to X\times Y\to Y   where the first map is the graph morphism and so is a complete intersection morphism.
