   Long Josephson junction      Long Josephson junction   In superconductivity , a long Josephson junction (LJJ) is a Josephson junction which has one or more dimensions longer than the Josephson penetration depth     λ  J     subscript  λ  J    \lambda_{J}   . This definition is not strict.  In terms of underlying model a short Josephson junction is characterized by the Josephson phase     ϕ   (  t  )       ϕ  t    \phi(t)   , which is only a function of time, but not of coordinates i.e. the Josephson junction is assumed to be point-like in space. In contrast, in a long Josephson junction the Josephson phase can be a function of one or two spatial coordinates, i.e.,    ϕ   (  x  ,  t  )       ϕ   x  t     \phi(x,t)   or    ϕ   (  x  ,  y  ,  t  )       ϕ   x  y  t     \phi(x,y,t)   .  Simple model: the sine-Gordon equation  The simplest and the most frequently used model which describes the dynamics of the Josephson phase   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   in LJJ is the so-called perturbed sine-Gordon equation . For the case of 1D LJJ it looks like:           λ  J  2    ϕ   x  x     -    ω  p   -  2     ϕ   t  t     -   sin   (  ϕ  )     =     ω  c   -  1     ϕ  t    -   j  /   j  c      ,           superscript   subscript  λ  J   2    subscript  ϕ    x  x        superscript   subscript  ω  p     2     subscript  ϕ    t  t       ϕ         superscript   subscript  ω  c     1     subscript  ϕ  t      j   subscript  j  c       \lambda_{J}^{2}\phi_{xx}-\omega_{p}^{-2}\phi_{tt}-\sin(\phi)=\omega_{c}^{-1}%
 \phi_{t}-j/j_{c},      where subscripts   x   x   x   and   t   t   t   denote partial derivatives with respect to   x   x   x   and   t   t   t   ,    λ  J     subscript  λ  J    \lambda_{J}   is the Josephson penetration depth ,    ω  p     subscript  ω  p    \omega_{p}   is the Josephson plasma frequency ,    ω  c     subscript  ω  c    \omega_{c}   is the so-called characteristic frequency and    j  /   j  c       j   subscript  j  c     j/j_{c}   is the bias current density   j   j   j   normalized to the critical current density    j  c     subscript  j  c    j_{c}   . In the above equation, the r.h.s. is considered as perturbation.  Usually for theoretical studies one uses normalized sine-Gordon equation:          ϕ   x  x    -   ϕ   t  t    -   sin   (  ϕ  )     =    α   ϕ  t    -  γ    ,         subscript  ϕ    x  x     subscript  ϕ    t  t      ϕ        α   subscript  ϕ  t    γ     \phi_{xx}-\phi_{tt}-\sin(\phi)=\alpha\phi_{t}-\gamma,      where spatial coordinate is normalized to the Josephson penetration depth     λ  J     subscript  λ  J    \lambda_{J}   and time is normalized to the inverse plasma frequency    ω  p   -  1      superscript   subscript  ω  p     1     \omega_{p}^{-1}   . The parameter    α  =   1  /    β  c         α    1     subscript  β  c       \alpha=1/\sqrt{\beta_{c}}   is the dimensionless damping parameter (    β  c     subscript  β  c    \beta_{c}   is McCumber-Stewart parameter ), and, finally,    γ  =   j  /   j  c        γ    j   subscript  j  c      \gamma=j/j_{c}   is a normalized bias current.  Important solutions   Small amplitude plasma waves.     ϕ   (  x  ,  t  )    =   A   exp   [   i   (    k  x   -   ω  t    )    ]           ϕ   x  t      A      i      k  x     ω  t         \phi(x,t)=A\exp[i(kx-\omega t)]       Soliton (aka fluxon , Josephson vortex ): 1         ϕ   (  x  ,  t  )    =   4   arctan   exp   (   ±    x  -   u  t      1  -   u  2       )            ϕ   x  t      4       plus-or-minus      x    u  t        1   superscript  u  2            \phi(x,t)=4\arctan\exp\left(\pm\frac{x-ut}{\sqrt{1-u^{2}}}\right)      Here   x   x   x   ,   t   t   t   and    u  =   v  /   c  0        u    v   subscript  c  0      u=v/c_{0}   are the normalized coordinate, normalized time and normalized velocity. The physical velocity   v   v   v   is normalized to the so-called Swihart velocity      c  0   =    λ  J    ω  p         subscript  c  0      subscript  λ  J    subscript  ω  p      c_{0}=\lambda_{J}\omega_{p}   , which represent a typical unit of velocity and equal to the unit of space    λ  J     subscript  λ  J    \lambda_{J}   divided by unit of time    ω  p   -  1      superscript   subscript  ω  p     1     \omega_{p}^{-1}   .
