   Linear phase      Linear phase   Linear phase is a property of a filter , where the phase response of the filter is a linear function of frequency . The result is that all frequency components of the input signal are shifted in time (usually delayed) by the same constant amount, which is referred to as the phase delay . And consequently, there is no phase distortion due to the time delay of frequencies relative to one another.  For discrete-time signals, perfect linear phase is easily achieved with a finite impulse response (FIR) filter.  Approximations can be achieved with infinite impulse response (IIR) designs, which are more computationally efficient.  Several techniques are :   a Bessel transfer function which has a maximally flat group delay  a maximally flat group delay approximation function  a phase equalizer   Examples  When a sinusoid    ,  sin   (  ω  t  +  θ  )   ,     fragments  normal-,    fragments  normal-(  ω  t   θ  normal-)   normal-,    ,\ \sin(\omega t+\theta),   passes through a filter with group delay    τ  ,    τ   \tau,   the result is :         A   (  ω  )    ⋅   sin   (    ω   (   t  -  τ   )    +  θ   )     =    A   (  ω  )    ⋅   sin   (     ω  t   +  θ   -   ω  τ    )      ,       normal-⋅    A  ω         ω    t  τ    θ      normal-⋅    A  ω           ω  t   θ     ω  τ        A(\omega)\cdot\sin(\omega(t-\tau)+\theta)=A(\omega)\cdot\sin(\omega t+\theta-%
 \omega\tau),     where :       A   (  ω  )       A  ω    A(\omega)   is a frequency-dependent amplitude multiplier.  The phase shift    ω  τ      ω  τ    \omega\tau   is a linear function of frequency (ω), and    -  τ      τ    -\tau   is the slope.   For linear phase, it is sufficient to have that property only in the passband (s) of the filter, where |A(ω)| has relatively large values. Therefore both magnitude and phase graphs ( Bode plots ) are customarily used to examine a filter's linearity. A "linear" phase graph may contain discontinuities of π and/or 2π radians. The smaller ones happen where A(ω) changes sign. Since |A(ω)| cannot be negative, the changes are reflected in the phase plot. The 2π discontinuities happen because of plotting the principal value of     ω  τ   ,      ω  τ    \omega\tau,   instead of the actual value.  In discrete-time applications, one only examines the region of frequencies between 0 and the Nyquist frequency , because of periodicity and symmetry. Depending on the frequency units , the Nyquist frequency may be 0.5, 1.0, π, or ½ of the actual sample-rate.  Some examples of linear and non-linear phase are shown below.

Because of this constant, the phase of the system is not a strictly linear function of frequency, but it retains many of the useful properties of linear phase systems. linear phase is a applicable in any data transmission in which phase is used to encode information. • Any signal which is to be passed through a filter which must not distort the wave shape • Interpolators or decimators in which a linear phase FIR filter can be made more efficient than a comparable IIR filter. 3  See also   Minimum phase   Citations  "  Category:Digital signal processing     ↩  ↩  ↩
