   Fierz identity      Fierz identity   In theoretical physics , a Fierz identity is an identity that allows one to rewrite bilinears of the product of two spinors as a linear combination of products of the bilinears of the individual spinors. It is named after Swiss physicist Markus Fierz .  There is a version of the Fierz identities for Dirac spinors and there is another version for Weyl spinors . And there are versions for other dimensions besides 3+1 dimensions.  Spinor bilinears can be thought of as elements of a Clifford Algebra . Then the Fierz identity is the concrete realization of the relation to the exterior algebra . The identities for a generic scalar written as the contraction of two Dirac bilinears of the same type can be written with coefficients according the following table.
