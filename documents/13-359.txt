   Additive map      Additive map   In algebra an additive map , Z-linear map or additive function is a function that preserves the addition operation:        f   (   x  +  y   )    =    f   (  x  )    +   f   (  y  )      .        f    x  y        f  x     f  y      f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y).   for any two elements x and y in the domain. For example, any linear map is additive. When the domain is the real numbers , this is Cauchy's functional equation . For a specific case of this definition, see additive polynomial . Any homomorphism  f between abelian groups is additive by this definition.  More formally, an additive map of ring    R  1     subscript  R  1    R_{1}   into ring    R  2     subscript  R  2    R_{2}   is a homomorphism       f  :    R  1   →    R  2      ,     normal-:  f   normal-→   subscript  R  1    subscript  R  2      f:R_{1}\to R_{2}\,,   of the additive group of    R  1     subscript  R  1    R_{1}   into the additive group of    R  2     subscript  R  2    R_{2}   .  An additive map is not required to preserve the product operation of the ring.  If   f   f   f   and   g   g   g   are additive maps, then the map    f  +  g      f  g    f+g   (defined pointwise ) is additive.  Additive map of a division ring  Let   D   D   D   be a division ring of characteristic    0   0    . We can represent an additive map    f  :   D  →  D      normal-:  f   normal-→  D  D     f:D\to D   of the division ring   D   D   D   as        f   (  x  )    =     f      (  s  )   0      x     f      (  s  )   1       .        f  x      subscript  f    s  0    x   subscript  f    s  1       f(x)={}_{(s)0}f\ x\ {}_{(s)1}f\,.     We assume a sum over the index   s   s   s   . The number of items depends on the function   f   f   f   . The expressions      f     (  s  )   0     ,   f     (  s  )   1      ∈  D        subscript  f    s  0     subscript  f    s  1     D    {}_{(s)0}f,{}_{(s)1}f\in D   are called the components of the additive map.
