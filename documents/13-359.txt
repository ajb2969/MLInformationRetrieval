Additive map

In algebra an additive map, Z-linear map or additive function is a function that preserves the addition operation:


 
  for any two elements x and y in the domain. For example, any linear map is additive. When the domain is the real numbers, this is Cauchy's functional equation. For a specific case of this definition, see additive polynomial. Any homomorphism f between abelian groups is additive by this definition.
More formally, an additive map of ring 
 
 
 
  into ring 
 
 
 
  is a homomorphism


 
  of the additive group of 
 
 
 
  into the additive group of 
 
 
 
 .
An additive map is not required to preserve the product operation of the ring.
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are additive maps, then the map 
 
 
 
  (defined pointwise) is additive.
Additive map of a division ring
Let 
 
 
 
  be a division ring of characteristic

 
 . We can represent an additive map 
 
 
 
  of the division ring 
 
 
 
  as



We assume a sum over the index 
 
 
 
 . The number of items depends on the function 
 
 
 
 . The expressions 
 
 
 
  are called the components of the additive map.
