   Morphological skeleton      Morphological skeleton   In digital image processing , morphological skeleton is a skeleton (or medial axis ) representation of a shape or binary image , computed by means of morphological operators .  Morphological skeletons are of two kinds:   Those defined by means of morphological openings , from which the original shape can be reconstructed,  Those computed by means of the hit-or-miss transform , which preserve the shape's topology .   Skeleton by openings  Lantuéjoul's formula  Continuous images  In ( Lantuéjoul 1977 ), 1 Lantuéjoul derived the following morphological formula for the skeleton of a continuous binary image    X  ⊂   ℝ  2       X   superscript  ℝ  2     X\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}   :       S   (  X  )    =    ⋃   ρ  >  0      ⋂   μ  >  0     [    (   X  ⊖   ρ  B    )   -     (   X  ⊖   ρ  B    )   ∘  μ    B  ¯     ]           S  X     subscript     ρ  0      subscript     μ  0     delimited-[]     symmetric-difference  X    ρ  B         symmetric-difference  X    ρ  B    μ    normal-¯  B          S(X)=\bigcup_{\rho>0}\bigcap_{\mu>0}\left[(X\ominus\rho B)-(X\ominus\rho B)%
 \circ\mu\overline{B}\right]   ,  where   ⊖   symmetric-difference   \ominus   and   ∘     \circ   are the morphological erosion and opening , respectively,    ρ  B      ρ  B    \rho B   is an open ball of radius    ρ   ρ   \rho   , and    B  ¯     normal-¯  B    \overline{B}   is the closure of   B   B   B   .  Discrete images  Let    {   n  B   }       n  B     \{nB\}   ,    n  =   0  ,  1  ,  …       n   0  1  normal-…     n=0,1,\ldots   , be a family of shapes, where B is a structuring element ,       n  B   =     B  ⊕  ⋯  ⊕  B   ⏟    n  times          n  B    subscript   normal-⏟   direct-sum  B  normal-⋯  B      n  times      nB=\underbrace{B\oplus\cdots\oplus B}_{n\mbox{ times}}   , and       0  B   =   {  o  }         0  B    o     0B=\{o\}   , where o denotes the origin.  The variable n is called the size of the structuring element.  Lantuéjoul's formula has been discretized as follows. For a discrete binary image    X  ⊂   ℤ  2       X   superscript  ℤ  2     X\subset\mathbb{Z}^{2}   , the skeleton S(X) is the union of the skeleton subsets     {    S  n    (  X  )    }        subscript  S  n   X     \{S_{n}(X)\}   ,    n  =   0  ,  1  ,  …  ,  N       n   0  1  normal-…  N     n=0,1,\ldots,N   , where:        S  n    (  X  )    =    (   X  ⊖   n  B    )   -    (   X  ⊖   n  B    )   ∘  B           subscript  S  n   X      symmetric-difference  X    n  B       symmetric-difference  X    n  B    B      S_{n}(X)=(X\ominus nB)-(X\ominus nB)\circ B   .  Reconstruction from the skeleton  The original shape X can be reconstructed from the set of skeleton subsets    {    S  n    (  X  )    }        subscript  S  n   X     \{S_{n}(X)\}   as follows:      X  =    ⋃  n    (     S  n    (  X  )    ⊕   n  B    )        X    subscript   n    direct-sum     subscript  S  n   X     n  B       X=\bigcup_{n}(S_{n}(X)\oplus nB)   .  Partial reconstructions can also be performed, leading to opened versions of the original shape:        ⋃   n  ≥  m     (     S  n    (  X  )    ⊕   n  B    )    =    X  ∘  m   B         subscript     n  m     direct-sum     subscript  S  n   X     n  B         X  m   B     \bigcup_{n\geq m}(S_{n}(X)\oplus nB)=X\circ mB   .  The skeleton as the centers of the maximal disks  Let    n   B  z       n   subscript  B  z     nB_{z}   be the translated version of    n  B      n  B    nB   to the point z , that is,     n   B  z    =   {   x  ∈  E   |    x  -  z   ∈   n  B    }         n   subscript  B  z     conditional-set    x  E       x  z     n  B       nB_{z}=\{x\in E|x-z\in nB\}   .  A shape    n   B  z       n   subscript  B  z     nB_{z}   centered at z is called a maximal disk in a set A when:        n   B  z    ∈  A        n   subscript  B  z    A    nB_{z}\in A   , and  if, for some integer m and some point y ,     n   B  z    ⊆   m   B  y          n   subscript  B  z      m   subscript  B  y      nB_{z}\subseteq mB_{y}   , then     m   B  y    ⊈  A     not-subset-of-or-equals    m   subscript  B  y    A    mB_{y}\not\subseteq A   .   Each skeleton subset     S  n    (  X  )        subscript  S  n   X    S_{n}(X)   consists of the centers of all maximal disks of size n .
