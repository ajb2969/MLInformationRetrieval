Deoxylimonate A-ring-lactonase

In enzymology, a deoxylimonate A-ring-lactonase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

deoxylimonate + H2O 
 
 
 
  deoxylimononic acid D-ring-lactone
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are deoxylimonate and H2O, whereas its product is deoxylimononic acid D-ring-lactone.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is deoxylimonate A-ring-lactonohydrolase.
