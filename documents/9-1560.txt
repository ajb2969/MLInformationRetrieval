   Navarro–Frenk–White profile      Navarro–Frenk–White profile   The Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) profile is a spatial mass distribution of dark matter fitted to dark matter haloes identified in N-body simulations by Julio Navarro , Carlos Frenk and Simon White . 1 The NFW profile is one of the most commonly used model profiles for dark matter halos. 2  Density distribution  In the NFW profile, the density of dark matter as a function of radius is given by:       ρ   (  r  )    =    ρ  0     r   R  s      (    1   +   r   R  s     )   2           ρ  r      subscript  ρ  0       r   subscript  R  s     superscript    1    r   subscript  R  s     2       \rho(r)=\frac{\rho_{0}}{\frac{r}{R_{s}}\left(1~{}+~{}\frac{r}{R_{s}}\right)^{2}}     where ρ 0 and the "scale radius", R s , are parameters which vary from halo to halo.  The integrated mass inside of some radius R max is      M  =    ∫  0   R  max     4  π   r  2   ρ   (  r  )   d  r    =   4  π   ρ  0    R  s  3    [    ln   (     R  s   +   R  max     R  s    )    -    R  max     R  s   +   R  max      ]          M    superscript   subscript   0    subscript  R       4  π   superscript  r  2   ρ  r  d  r           4  π   subscript  ρ  0    superscript   subscript  R  s   3    delimited-[]           subscript  R  s    subscript  R      subscript  R  s        subscript  R       subscript  R  s    subscript  R            M=\int_{0}^{R_{\max}}4\pi r^{2}\rho(r)\,dr=4\pi\rho_{0}R_{s}^{3}\left[\ln\left%
 (\frac{R_{s}+R_{\max}}{R_{s}}\right)-\frac{R_{\max}}{R_{s}+R_{\max}}\right]     The total mass is divergent, but it is often useful to take the edge of the halo to be the virial radius, R vir , which is related to the "concentration parameter", c , and scale radius via       R  vir   =   c   R  s         subscript  R  vir     c   subscript  R  s      R_{\mathrm{vir}}=cR_{s}     The virial radius is often referred to as    R  200     subscript  R  200    R_{200}   , and is defined as the radius at which the average density within this radius is 200 times the critical density. In this case, the total mass in the halo is      M  =    ∫  0   R  vir     4  π   r  2   ρ   (  r  )   d  r    =   4  π   ρ  0    R  s  3    [    ln   (   1  +  c   )    -   c   1  +  c     ]          M    superscript   subscript   0    subscript  R  vir      4  π   superscript  r  2   ρ  r  d  r           4  π   subscript  ρ  0    superscript   subscript  R  s   3    delimited-[]        1  c      c    1  c          M=\int_{0}^{R_{\mathrm{vir}}}4\pi r^{2}\rho(r)\,dr=4\pi\rho_{0}R_{s}^{3}\left[%

The integral of the squared density is        ∫  0   R  max     4  π   r  2   ρ     (  r  )   2    d  r    =     4  π   3    R  s  3    ρ  0  2    [   1  -    R  s  3     (    R  s   +   R  max    )   3     ]          superscript   subscript   0    subscript  R       4  π   superscript  r  2   ρ   superscript  r  2   d  r          4  π   3    superscript   subscript  R  s   3    superscript   subscript  ρ  0   2    delimited-[]    1     superscript   subscript  R  s   3    superscript     subscript  R  s    subscript  R     3         \int_{0}^{R_{\max}}4\pi r^{2}\rho(r)^{2}\,dr=\frac{4\pi}{3}R_{s}^{3}\rho_{0}^{%

Alternative models, in particular the Einasto profile , have been shown to represent the dark matter profiles of simulated halos as well as or better than the NFW profile. 4 5 The Einasto profile has a finite (zero) central slope, unlike the NFW profile which has a divergent (infinite) central density. Because of the limited resolution of N-body simulations, it is not yet known which model provides the best description of the central densities of simulated dark-matter halos.  Observations of halos  The observations of both the Milky Way and M31 may be compatible with the NFW profile for the dark matter halo. 6 The dark matter profile of smaller galaxies tend to have flatter distributions of dark matter in the central region, known as the cuspy halo problem .
