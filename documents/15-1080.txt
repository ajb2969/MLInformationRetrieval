Flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase

Flavanoid 3',5'-hydroxylase () is an enzyme with system name flavanone,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

flavanone + 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + 2 O2

 
  3',5'-dihydroxyflavanone + 2 NADP+ + 2 H2O (overall reaction)
 
(1a) flavanone + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  3'-hydroxyflavanone + NADP+ + H2O
 
(1b) 3'-hydroxyflavanone + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  3',5'-dihydroxyflavanone + NADP+ + H2O
 

Flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase is a heme-thiolate protein (P-450).
