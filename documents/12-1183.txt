Decision list

Decision lists are a representation for Boolean functions.1 Single term decision lists are more expressive than disjunctions and conjunctions; however, 1-term decision lists are less expressive than the general disjunctive normal form and the conjunctive normal form.
The language specified by a k-length decision list includes as a subset the language specified by a k-depth decision tree.
Learning decision lists can be used for attribute efficient learning.2
Definition
A decision list (DL) of length $r$ is of the form:
if $f_1$ then output $b_1$
else if $f_2$ then output $b_2$
...
else if $f_r$ then output $b_r$
where $f_i$ is the $i$th formula and $b_i$ is the $i$th boolean for $i \in \{1...r\}$. The last if-then-else is the default case, which means formula $f_r$ is always equal to true. A $k$-DL is a decision list where all of formulas have at most $k$ terms. Sometimes "decision list" is used to refer to a 1-DL, where all of the formulas are either a variable or its negation.
