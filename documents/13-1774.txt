   Gauss iterated map      Gauss iterated map   In mathematics , the Gauss map (also known as Gaussian map 1 or mouse map ), is a nonlinear iterated map of the reals into a real interval given by the Gaussian function :        x   n  +  1    =    exp   (   -   α   x  n  2     )    +  β    ,       subscript  x    n  1            α   subscript   superscript  x  2   n      β     x_{n+1}=\exp(-\alpha x^{2}_{n})+\beta,\,     where α and β are real parameters.  Named after Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss , the function maps the bell shaped Gaussian function similar to the logistic map .  Properties  In the parameter real space    x  n     subscript  x  n    x_{n}   can be chaotic. The map is also called the mouse map because its bifurcation diagram resembles a mouse (see Figures).
