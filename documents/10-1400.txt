   Lignin peroxidase      Lignin peroxidase   Lignin is highly resistant to biodegradation and only higher fungi are capable of degrading the polymer via an oxidative process. This process has been studied extensively in the past twenty years, but the actual mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. The complicated structure of the lignin polymer and major difficulties in analysis are responsible for the relatively slow progress  Lignin is found to be degraded by an enzyme lignin peroxidases produced by some fungi like Phanerochaete chrysosporium . The mechanism by which lignin peroxidase (Lip) interacts with the lignin polymer involves Veratryl alcohol (Valc). Which is a secondary metabolite of white rot fungi that acts as a cofactor for the enzyme.  In enzymology , a lignin peroxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1,2-bis(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)propane-1,3-diol + H 2 O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde + 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethane-1,2-diol + H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1,2-bis(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)propane-1,3-diol and H 2 O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde , 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethane-1,2-diol , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a peroxide as acceptor (peroxidases) and can be included in the broad category of ligninases . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,2-bis(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)propane-1,3-diol:hydrogen-peroxide oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include diarylpropane oxygenase , ligninase I , diarylpropane peroxidase , LiP , diarylpropane:oxygen,hydrogen-peroxide oxidoreductase (C-C-bond-cleaving) . It employs one cofactor , heme .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
