   Particle decay      Particle decay   Particle decay is the spontaneous process of one elementary particle transforming into other elementary particles. During this process, an elementary particle becomes a different particle with less mass and an intermediate particle such as W boson in muon decay . The intermediate particle then transforms into other particles. If the particles created are not stable, the decay process can continue.  Particle decay is also used to refer to the decay of hadrons . However, the term is not typically used to describe radioactive decay , in which an unstable atomic nucleus is transformed into a lighter nucleus accompanied by the emission of particles or radiation, although the two are conceptually similar.  Note that this article uses natural units , where    c  =  ℏ  =   1.         c  Planck-constant-over-2-pi       1.     c=\hbar=1.\,     Probability of survival and particle lifetime  Particle decay is a Poisson process , and hence the probability that a particle survives for time t before decaying is given by an exponential distribution whose time constant depends on the particle's velocity:         P   (  t  )    =    e   -   t  /   (   γ  τ   )             P  t    superscript  e      t    γ  τ        P(t)=e^{-t/(\gamma\tau)}\,         where        τ   τ   \tau   is the mean lifetime of the particle (when at rest), and      γ  =   1    1  -    v  2   /   c  2           γ    1      1     superscript  v  2    superscript  c  2         \gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}   is the Lorentz factor of the particle.

For a particle of a mass M and four-momentum  P decaying into particles with momenta    p  i     subscript  p  i    p_{i}   , the differential decay rate is given by the general formula (expressing Fermi's golden rule )         d   Γ  n    =     S    |  ℳ  |   2     2  M    d   Φ  n    (  P  ;   p  1   ,   p  2   ,  …  ,   p  n   )          d   subscript  normal-Γ  n          S   superscript    ℳ   2      2  M    d   subscript  normal-Φ  n    P   subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2   normal-…   subscript  p  n       d\Gamma_{n}=\frac{S\left|\mathcal{M}\right|^{2}}{2M}d\Phi_{n}(P;p_{1},p_{2},%
 \dots,p_{n})\,         where  n is the number of particles created by the decay of the original,  S is a combinatorial factor to account for indistinguishable final states (see below),      ℳ    ℳ   \mathcal{M}\,   is the invariant matrix element or amplitude connecting the initial state to the final state (usually calculated using Feynman diagrams ),      d    Φ  n        d   subscript  normal-Φ  n     d\Phi_{n}\,   is an element of the phase space , and       p  i      subscript  p  i    p_{i}\,   is the four-momentum of particle i .     The factor S is given by        S  =    ∏   j  =  1   m     1    k  j   !

The phase space can be determined from         d   Φ  n    (  P  ;   p  1   ,   p  2   ,  …  ,   p  n   )    =     (   2  π   )   4    δ  4    (   P  -    ∑   i  =  1   n    p  i     )     ∏   i  =  1   n      d  3     p  →   i     2    (   2  π   )   3    E  i             d   subscript  normal-Φ  n    P   subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2   normal-…   subscript  p  n        superscript    2  π   4    superscript  δ  4     P    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  p  i       superscript   subscript  product    i  1    n        superscript  d  3    subscript   normal-→  p   i      2   superscript    2  π   3    subscript  E  i         d\Phi_{n}(P;p_{1},p_{2},\dots,p_{n})=(2\pi)^{4}\delta^{4}\left(P-\sum_{i=1}^{n%
 }p_{i}\right)\prod_{i=1}^{n}\frac{d^{3}\vec{p}_{i}}{2(2\pi)^{3}E_{i}}       where      δ  4      superscript  δ  4    \delta^{4}\,   is a four-dimensional Dirac delta function ,        p  →   i      subscript   normal-→  p   i    \vec{p}_{i}\,   is the (three-)momentum of particle i , and       E  i      subscript  E  i    E_{i}\,   is the energy of particle i .    One may integrate over the phase space to obtain the total decay rate for the specified final state.  If a particle has multiple decay branches or modes with different final states, its full decay rate is obtained by summing the decay rates for all branches. The branching ratio for each mode is given by its decay rate divided by the full decay rate.  Two-body decay  Decay rate  Say a parent particle of mass M decays into two particles, labeled 1 and 2 .

When the imaginary part is large compared to the real part, the particle is usually thought of as a resonance more than a particle. This is because in quantum field theory a particle of mass M (a real number ) is often exchanged between two other particles when there is not enough energy to create it, if the time to travel between these other particles is short enough, of order 1/M, according to the uncertainty principle . For a particle of mass    M  +   i  Γ       M    i  normal-Γ     \scriptstyle M+i\Gamma   , the particle can travel for time 1/M, but decays after time of order of    1  /  Γ      1  normal-Γ    \scriptstyle 1/\Gamma   . If    Γ  >  M      normal-Γ  M    \scriptstyle\Gamma>M   then the particle usually decays before it completes its travel. 1  See also   Relativistic Breit-Wigner distribution  Particle physics  List of particles  Weak interaction   Notes  External links    - See page 2.
