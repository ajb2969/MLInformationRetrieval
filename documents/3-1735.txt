Magnetomotive force

In physics, the magnetomotive force is a quantity appearing in the equation for the magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit, sometimes known as Hopkinson's law:


 
  where Φ is the magnetic flux and R is the reluctance of the circuit. It can be seen that the magnetomotive force plays a role in this equation analogous to the voltage V in Ohm's law: V = IR.
Magnetomotive force is analogous to electromotive force, emf (= difference in electric potential, or voltage, between the terminals of a source of electricity, e.g., a battery from which no current is being drawn) since it is the cause of magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit; i.e.,

ℱ = NI

where N is the number of turns in the coil and
 

I is the electric current through the circuit






ℱ = ΦR

where Φ is the magnetic flux and
 

R is the reluctance






ℱ = HL

where H is the magnetizing force (the strength of the magnetizing field) and
 

L is the mean length of a solenoid or the circumference of a toroid
