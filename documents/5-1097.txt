   Charm (quantum number)      Charm (quantum number)   Charm (symbol C ) is a flavour  quantum number representing the difference between the number of charm  quarks () and charm antiquarks () that are present in a particle:       C  =    n  c   -   n   c  ¯      .      C     subscript  n  c    subscript  n   normal-¯  normal-c       C=n_{\text{c}}-n_{\mathrm{\bar{c}}}.     By convention, the sign of flavour quantum numbers agree with the sign of the electric charge carried by the quark of corresponding flavour. The charm quark, which carries an electric charge ( Q ) of +, therefore carries a charm of +1. The charm antiquarks have the opposite charge (), and flavour quantum numbers ().  As with any flavour-related quantum numbers, charm is preserved under strong and electromagnetic interaction , but not under weak interaction (see CKM matrix ). For first-order weak decays, that is processes involving only one quark decay, charm can only vary by 1 (). Since first-order processes are more common than second-order processes (involving two quark decays), this can be used as an approximate " selection rule " for weak decays.
