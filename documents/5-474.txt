   Loop group      Loop group   In mathematics , a loop group is a group of loops in a topological group  G with multiplication defined pointwise.  Definition  In its most general form a loop group is a group of mappings from a manifold   M   M   M   to a topological group   G   G   G   .  More specifically, 1 let  S 1 }} , the circle in the complex plane, and let    L  G      L  G    LG   denote the space of continuous maps  , i.e.      L  G  =   {  γ  :   S  1   →  G  |  γ  ∈  C   (   S  1   ,  G  )   }   ,     fragments  L  G    fragments  normal-{  γ  normal-:   superscript  S  1   normal-→  G  normal-|  γ   C   fragments  normal-(   superscript  S  1   normal-,  G  normal-)   normal-}   normal-,    LG=\{\gamma:S^{1}\to G|\gamma\in C(S^{1},G)\},     equipped with the compact-open topology . An element of    L  G      L  G    LG   is called a loop in   G   G   G   . Pointwise multiplication of such loops gives    L  G      L  G    LG   the structure of a topological group. Parametrize with   θ   θ   θ   ,       γ  :   θ  ∈   S  1   ↦   γ   (  θ  )    ∈  G    ,     normal-:  γ      θ   superscript  S  1     maps-to      γ  θ        G      \gamma:\theta\in S^{1}\mapsto\gamma(\theta)\in G,     and define multiplication in    L  G      L  G    LG   by         (    γ  1    γ  2    )    (  θ  )    ≡    γ  1    (  θ  )    γ  2    (  θ  )     .           subscript  γ  1    subscript  γ  2    θ      subscript  γ  1   θ   subscript  γ  2   θ     (\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2})(\theta)\equiv\gamma_{1}(\theta)\gamma_{2}(\theta).     Associativity follows from associativity in   G   G   G   . The inverse is given by        γ   -  1    :     γ   -  1     (  θ  )    ≡   γ    (  θ  )    -  1       ,     normal-:   superscript  γ    1         superscript  γ    1    θ     γ   superscript  θ    1        \gamma^{-1}:\gamma^{-1}(\theta)\equiv\gamma(\theta)^{-1},   and the identity by       e  :   θ  ↦  e  ∈  G    .     normal-:  e     maps-to  θ  e       G      e:\theta\mapsto e\in G.     The space    L  G      L  G    LG   is called the free loop group on   G   G   G   . A loop group is any subgroup of the free loop group    L  G      L  G    LG   .  Examples  An important example of a loop group is the group      Ω   G       normal-Ω  G    \Omega G\,     of based loops on   G   G   G   . It is defined to be the kernel of the evaluation map       e  1   :    L  G   →  G      normal-:   subscript  e  1    normal-→    L  G   G     e_{1}:LG\to G   ,  and hence is a closed normal subgroup of    L  G      L  G    LG   . (Here, is the map that sends a loop to its value at   1   1   1   .) Note that we may embed   G   G   G   into    L  G      L  G    LG   as the subgroup of constant loops. Consequently, we arrive at a split exact sequence      1  →   Ω  G   →   L  G   →  G  →  1       normal-→  1    normal-Ω  G     normal-→      L  G     normal-→    G    normal-→    1     1\to\Omega G\to LG\to G\to 1   .  The space    L  G      L  G    LG   splits as a semi-direct product ,       L  G   =    Ω  G   ⋊  G         L  G    right-normal-factor-semidirect-product    normal-Ω  G   G     LG=\Omega G\rtimes G   .  We may also think of    Ω  G      normal-Ω  G    ΩG   as the loop space on   G   G   G   . From this point of view,    Ω  G      normal-Ω  G    ΩG   is a H -space with respect to concatenation of loops. On the face of it, this seems to provide    Ω  G      normal-Ω  G    ΩG   with two very different product maps. However, it can be shown that concatenation and pointwise multiplication are homotopic . Thus, in terms of the homotopy theory of    Ω  G      normal-Ω  G    ΩG   , these maps are interchangeable.
