Loop group

In mathematics, a loop group is a group of loops in a topological group G with multiplication defined pointwise.
Definition
In its most general form a loop group is a group of mappings from a manifold 
 
 
 
  to a topological group 
 
 
 
 .
More specifically,1 let  S1}}, the circle in the complex plane, and let 
 
 
 
  denote the space of continuous maps , i.e.



equipped with the compact-open topology. An element of 
 
 
 
  is called a loop in 
 
 
 
 . Pointwise multiplication of such loops gives 
 
 
 
  the structure of a topological group. Parametrize  with 
 
 
 
 ,



and define multiplication in 
 
 
 
  by



Associativity follows from associativity in 
 
 
 
 . The inverse is given by


 
  and the identity by



The space 
 
 
 
  is called the free loop group on 
 
 
 
 . A loop group is any subgroup of the free loop group 
 
 
 
 .
Examples
An important example of a loop group is the group



of based loops on 
 
 
 
 . It is defined to be the kernel of the evaluation map


 
 ,
and hence is a closed normal subgroup of 
 
 
 
 . (Here,  is the map that sends a loop to its value at 
 
 
 
 .) Note that we may embed 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
  as the subgroup of constant loops. Consequently, we arrive at a split exact sequence


 
 .
The space 
 
 
 
  splits as a semi-direct product,


 
 .
We may also think of 
 
 
 
  as the loop space on 
 
 
 
 . From this point of view, 
 
 
 
  is a H-space with respect to concatenation of loops. On the face of it, this seems to provide 
 
 
 
  with two very different product maps. However, it can be shown that concatenation and pointwise multiplication are homotopic. Thus, in terms of the homotopy theory of 
 
 
 
 , these maps are interchangeable.
Loop groups were used to explain the phenomenon of Bäcklund transforms in soliton equations by Chuu-Lian Terng and Karen Uhlenbeck.2
