   Isochron      Isochron   In the mathematical theory of dynamical systems , an isochron is a set of initial conditions for the system that all lead to the same long-term behaviour. 1 2  Mathematical isochron  An introductory example  Consider the ordinary differential equation for a solution    y   (  t  )       y  t    y(t)   evolving in time:          d  2   y    d   t  2     +    d  y    d  t     =  1             superscript  d  2   y     d   superscript  t  2         d  y     d  t     1    \frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}+\frac{dy}{dt}=1     This ordinary differential equation (ODE) needs two initial conditions at, say, time    t  =  0      t  0    t=0   . Denote the initial conditions by     y   (  0  )    =   y  0         y  0    subscript  y  0     y(0)=y_{0}   and       d  y   /  d   t   (  0  )    =   y  0  ′             d  y   d   t  0    subscript   superscript  y  normal-′   0     dy/dt(0)=y^{\prime}_{0}   where    y  0     subscript  y  0    y_{0}   and    y  0  ′     subscript   superscript  y  normal-′   0    y^{\prime}_{0}   are some parameters. The following argument shows that the isochrons for this system are here the straight lines      y  0   +   y  0  ′    =  constant         subscript  y  0    subscript   superscript  y  normal-′   0    constant    y_{0}+y^{\prime}_{0}=\mbox{constant}   .  The general solution of the above ODE is      y  =   t  +  A  +   B   exp   (   -  t   )          y    t  A    B      t        y=t+A+B\exp(-t)\,     Now, as time increases,    t  →  ∞     normal-→  t     t\to\infty   , the exponential terms decays very quickly to zero ( exponential decay ). Thus all solutions of the ODE quickly approach    y  →   t  +  A      normal-→  y    t  A     y\to t+A   . That is, all solutions with the same   A   A   A   have the same long term evolution. The exponential decay of the    B   exp   (   -  t   )        B      t      B\exp(-t)   term brings together a host of solutions to share the same long term evolution. Find the isochrons by answering which initial conditions have the same   A   A   A   .  At the initial time    t  =  0      t  0    t=0   we have     y  0   =   A  +  B        subscript  y  0     A  B     y_{0}=A+B   and     y  0  ′   =   1  -  B        subscript   superscript  y  normal-′   0     1  B     y^{\prime}_{0}=1-B   . Algebraically eliminate the immaterial constant   B   B   B   from these two equations to deduce that all initial conditions      y  0   +   y  0  ′    =   1  +  A          subscript  y  0    subscript   superscript  y  normal-′   0      1  A     y_{0}+y^{\prime}_{0}=1+A   have the same   A   A   A   , hence the same long term evolution, and hence form an isochron.  Accurate forecasting requires isochrons  Let's turn to a more interesting application of the notion of isochrons. Isochrons arise when trying to forecast predictions from models of dynamical systems. Consider the toy system of two coupled ordinary differential equations        d  x    d  t    =   -   x  y  and    d  y    d  t      =     -  y   +   x  2    -   2   y  2               d  x     d  t        x  y  and      d  y     d  t                 y    superscript  x  2      2   superscript  y  2        \frac{dx}{dt}=-xy\text{ and }\frac{dy}{dt}=-y+x^{2}-2y^{2}     A marvellous mathematical trick is the normal form (mathematics) transformation. 3 Here the coordinate transformation near the origin      x  =   X  +   X  Y   +   ⋯  and  y    =   Y  +   2   Y  2    +   X  2   +  ⋯         x    X    X  Y     normal-⋯  and  y           Y    2   superscript  Y  2     superscript  X  2   normal-⋯      x=X+XY+\cdots\text{ and }y=Y+2Y^{2}+X^{2}+\cdots     to new variables    (  X  ,  Y  )     X  Y    (X,Y)   transforms the dynamics to the separated form        d  X    d  t    =    -   X  3    +   ⋯  and    d  Y    d  t      =    (     -  1   -   2   X  2     +  ⋯   )   Y             d  X     d  t         superscript  X  3      normal-⋯  and      d  Y     d  t                   1     2   superscript  X  2     normal-⋯   Y      \frac{dX}{dt}=-X^{3}+\cdots\text{ and }\frac{dY}{dt}=(-1-2X^{2}+\cdots)Y     Hence, near the origin,   Y   Y   Y   decays to zero exponentially quickly as its equation is       d  Y   /  d   t   =    (  negative  )   Y             d  Y   d   t     negative  Y     dY/dt=(\text{negative})Y   . So the long term evolution is determined solely by   X   X   X   : the   X   X   X   equation is the model.  Let us use the   X   X   X   equation to predict the future. Given some initial values    (   x  0   ,   y  0   )      subscript  x  0    subscript  y  0     (x_{0},y_{0})   of the original variables: what initial value should we use for    X   (  0  )       X  0    X(0)   ? Answer: the    X  0     subscript  X  0    X_{0}   that has the same long term evolution. In the normal form above,   X   X   X   evolves independently of   Y   Y   Y   . So all initial conditions with the same   X   X   X   , but different   Y   Y   Y   , have the same long term evolution. Fix   X   X   X   and vary   Y   Y   Y   gives the curving isochrons in the    (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,y)   plane. For example, very near the origin the isochrons of the above system are approximately the lines     x  -   X  y    =   X  -   X  3          x    X  y      X   superscript  X  3      x-Xy=X-X^{3}   . Find which isochron the initial values    (   x  0   ,   y  0   )      subscript  x  0    subscript  y  0     (x_{0},y_{0})   lie on: that isochron is characterised by some    X  0     subscript  X  0    X_{0}   ; the initial condition that gives the correct forecast from the model for all time is then     X   (  0  )    =   X  0         X  0    subscript  X  0     X(0)=X_{0}   .  You may find such normal form transformations for relatively simple systems of ordinary differential equations, both deterministic and stochastic, via an interactive web site. 1  References    "  Category:Dynamical systems     J.
