   Eilenberg–Zilber theorem      Eilenberg–Zilber theorem   In mathematics , specifically in algebraic topology , the Eilenberg–Zilber theorem is an important result in establishing the link between the homology groups of a product space     X  ×  Y      X  Y    X\times Y   and those of the spaces   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   . The theorem first appeared in a 1953 paper in the American Journal of Mathematics .  Statement of the theorem  The theorem can be formulated as follows. Suppose   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   are topological spaces , Then we have the three chain complexes      C  *    (  X  )        subscript  C    X    C_{*}(X)   ,     C  *    (  Y  )        subscript  C    Y    C_{*}(Y)   , and     C  *    (   X  ×  Y   )        subscript  C      X  Y     C_{*}(X\times Y)   . (The argument applies equally to the simplicial or singular chain complexes.) We also have the tensor product complex        C  *    (  X  )    ⊗   C  *     (  Y  )        tensor-product     subscript  C    X    subscript  C     Y    C_{*}(X)\otimes C_{*}(Y)   , whose differential is, by definition,       δ   (   σ  ⊗  τ   )    =      δ  X   σ   ⊗  τ   +       (   -  1   )   p   σ   ⊗   δ  Y    τ          δ   tensor-product  σ  τ       tensor-product     subscript  δ  X   σ   τ      tensor-product     superscript    1   p   σ    subscript  δ  Y    τ      \delta(\sigma\otimes\tau)=\delta_{X}\sigma\otimes\tau+(-1)^{p}\sigma\otimes%
 \delta_{Y}\tau     for    σ  ∈    C  p    (  X  )        σ     subscript  C  p   X     \sigma\in C_{p}(X)   and    δ  X     subscript  δ  X    \delta_{X}   ,    δ  Y     subscript  δ  Y    \delta_{Y}   the differentials on     C  *    (  X  )        subscript  C    X    C_{*}(X)   ,     C  *    (  Y  )        subscript  C    Y    C_{*}(Y)   .  Then the theorem says that we have chain maps      F  :     C  *    (   X  ×  Y   )    →       C  *    (  X  )    ⊗   C  *     (  Y  )    ,  G    :       C  *    (  X  )    ⊗   C  *     (  Y  )    →    C  *    (   X  ×  Y   )          normal-:  F   normal-→     subscript  C      X  Y        tensor-product     subscript  C    X    subscript  C     Y   G      normal-:     normal-→     tensor-product     subscript  C    X    subscript  C     Y      subscript  C      X  Y        F:C_{*}(X\times Y)\rightarrow C_{*}(X)\otimes C_{*}(Y),\quad G:C_{*}(X)\otimes

 _{*}(Y)\rightarrow C_{*}(X\times Y)     such that    F  G      F  G    FG   is the identity and    G  F      G  F    GF   is chain-homotopic to the identity. Moreover, the maps are natural in   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   . Consequently the two complexes must have the same homology :         H  *    (    C  *    (   X  ×  Y   )    )    ≅    H  *    (      C  *    (  X  )    ⊗   C  *     (  Y  )    )     .         subscript  H       subscript  C      X  Y        subscript  H       tensor-product     subscript  C    X    subscript  C     Y      H_{*}(C_{*}(X\times Y))\cong H_{*}(C_{*}(X)\otimes C_{*}(Y)).     An important generalisation to the non-abelian case using crossed complexes is given in the paper by Tonks below. This give full details of a result on the (simplicial) classifying space of a crossed complex stated but not proved in the paper by Brown and Higgins on classifying spaces.  Consequences  The Eilenberg–Zilber theorem is a key ingredient in establishing the Künneth theorem , which expresses the homology groups     H  *    (   X  ×  Y   )        subscript  H      X  Y     H_{*}(X\times Y)   in terms of     H  *    (  X  )        subscript  H    X    H_{*}(X)   and     H  *    (  Y  )        subscript  H    Y    H_{*}(Y)   . In light of the Eilenberg–Zilber theorem, the content of the Künneth theorem consists in analysing how the homology of the tensor product complex relates to the homologies of the factors.
