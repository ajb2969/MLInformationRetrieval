<h1>Algebraic K-theory</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Algebraic <em>K</em>-theory</strong> is a subject area in mathematics with connections to <a class="uri" href="geometry" title="wikilink">geometry</a>, <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a>, <a href="ring_theory" title="wikilink">ring theory</a>, and <a href="number_theory" title="wikilink">number theory</a>. Geometric, algebraic, and arithmetic objects are assigned objects called <em>K</em>-groups. These are <a href="group_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">groups</a> in the sense of <a href="abstract_algebra" title="wikilink">abstract algebra</a>. They contain detailed information about the original object but are notoriously difficult to compute; for example, an important outstanding problem is to compute the <em>K</em>-theory of the <a href="integer" title="wikilink">integers</a>.</p>

<p><em>K</em>-theory was discovered in the late 1960s by <a href="Alexander_Grothendieck" title="wikilink">Alexander Grothendieck</a> in his study of <a href="intersection_theory" title="wikilink">intersection theory</a> on <a href="algebraic_variety" title="wikilink">algebraic varieties</a>. Intersection theory is still a motivating force in the development of algebraic <em>K</em>-theory through its links with <a href="motivic_cohomology" title="wikilink">motivic cohomology</a> and specifically <a href="Chow_group" title="wikilink">Chow groups</a>. The subject also includes classical number-theoretic topics like <a href="quadratic_reciprocity" title="wikilink">quadratic reciprocity</a> and embeddings of <a href="number_field" title="wikilink">number fields</a> into the <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real numbers</a> and <a href="complex_number" title="wikilink">complex numbers</a>, as well as more modern concerns like the construction of higher <a href="regulator_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">regulators</a> and special values of <a href="L-function" title="wikilink">L-functions</a>.</p>

<p>The lower <em>K</em>-groups were discovered first, in the sense that adequate descriptions of these groups in terms of other algebraic structures were found. For example, if <em>F</em> is a <a href="field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">field</a>, then <mtpl></mtpl> is isomorphic to the integers <strong>Z</strong> and is closely related to the notion of <a href="dimension_(vector_space)" title="wikilink">vector space dimension</a>. For a commutative ring <em>R</em>, <mtpl></mtpl> is the <a href="Picard_group" title="wikilink">Picard group</a> of <em>R</em>, and when <em>R</em> is the ring of integers in a number field, this generalizes the classical construction of the <a href="class_group" title="wikilink">class group</a>. The group <em>K</em><sub>1</sub>(<em>R</em>) is closely related to the group of units <mtpl></mtpl>, and if <em>R</em> is a field, it is exactly the group of units. For a number field <em>F</em>, <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>(<em>F</em>) is related to <a href="class_field_theory" title="wikilink">class field theory</a>, the <a href="Hilbert_symbol" title="wikilink">Hilbert symbol</a>, and the solvability of quadratic equations over completions. In contrast, finding the correct definition of the higher <em>K</em>-groups of rings was a difficult achievement of <a href="Daniel_Quillen" title="wikilink">Daniel Quillen</a>, and many of the basic facts about the higher <em>K</em>-groups of algebraic varieties were not known until the work of <a href="Robert_Wayne_Thomason" title="wikilink">Robert Thomason</a>.</p>

<p>In the 19th century, <a href="Bernhard_Riemann" title="wikilink">Bernhard Riemann</a> and his student <a href="Gustav_Roch" title="wikilink">Gustav Roch</a> proved what is now known as the <a href="Riemann–Roch_theorem" title="wikilink">Riemann–Roch theorem</a>. If <em>X</em> is a Riemann surface, then the sets of <a href="meromorphic_function" title="wikilink">meromorphic functions</a> and meromorphic <a href="differential_form" title="wikilink">differential forms</a> on <em>X</em> form vector spaces. A <a href="line_bundle" title="wikilink">line bundle</a> on <em>X</em> determines subspaces of these vector spaces, and if <em>X</em> is projective, then these subspaces are finite dimensional. The Riemann–Roch theorem states that the difference in dimensions between these subspaces is equal to the degree of the line bundle (a measure of twistedness) plus one minus the genus of <em>X</em>. In the mid-20th century, the Riemann–Roch theorem was generalized by <a href="Friedrich_Hirzebruch" title="wikilink">Friedrich Hirzebruch</a> to all algebraic varieties. In Hirzebruch's formulation, the <a href="Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch_theorem" title="wikilink">Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem</a>, the theorem became a statement about <a href="Euler_characteristic" title="wikilink">Euler characteristics</a>: The Euler characteristic of a <a href="vector_bundle" title="wikilink">vector bundle</a> on an algebraic variety (which is the alternating sum of the dimensions of its cohomology groups) equals the Euler characteristic of the trivial bundle plus a correction factor coming from <a href="characteristic_class" title="wikilink">characteristic classes</a> of the vector bundle. This is a generalization because on a projective Riemann surface, the Euler characteristic of a line bundle equals the difference in dimensions mentioned previously, the Euler characteristic of the trivial bundle is one minus the genus, and the only non-trivial characteristic class is the degree.</p>

<p>The subject of <em>K</em>-theory takes its name from a 1957 construction of <a href="Alexander_Grothendieck" title="wikilink">Alexander Grothendieck</a> which appeared in the <a href="Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch_theorem" title="wikilink">Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem</a>, his generalization of Hirzebruch's theorem.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Let <em>X</em> be a smooth algebraic variety. To each vector bundle on <em>X</em>, Grothendieck associates an invariant, its <em>class</em>. The set of all classes on <em>X</em> was called <em>K</em>(<em>X</em>) from the German <em>Klasse</em>. By definition, <em>K</em>(<em>X</em>) is a quotient of the free abelian group on isomorphism classes of vector bundles on <em>X</em>, and so it is an abelian group. If the basis element corresponding to a vector bundle <em>V</em> is denoted [<em>V</em>], then for each short exact sequence of vector bundles:</p>

 Grothendieck imposed the relation . These generators and relations define <em>K</em>(<em>X</em>), and they imply that it is the universal way to assign invariants to vector bundles in a way compatible with exact sequences.</p>

<p>Grothendieck took the perspective that the Riemann–Roch theorem is a statement about morphisms of varieties, not the varieties themselves. He proved that there is a homomorphism from <em>K</em>(<em>X</em>) to the <a href="Chow_group" title="wikilink">Chow groups</a> of <em>X</em> coming from the <a href="Chern_character" title="wikilink">Chern character</a> and <a href="Todd_class" title="wikilink">Todd class</a> of <em>X</em>. Additionally, he proved that a proper morphism  to a smooth variety <em>Y</em> determines a homomorphism <mtpl></mtpl> called the <em>pushforward</em>. This gives two ways of determining an element in the Chow group of <em>Y</em> from a vector bundle on <em>X</em>: Starting from <em>X</em>, one can first compute the pushforward in <em>K</em>-theory and then apply the Chern character and Todd class of <em>Y</em>, or one can first apply the Chern character and Todd class of <em>X</em> and then compute the pushforward for Chow groups. The Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem says that these are equal. When <em>Y</em> is a point, a vector bundle is a vector space, the class of a vector space is its dimension, and the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem specializes to Hirzebruch's theorem.</p>

<p>The group <em>K</em>(<em>X</em>) is now known as <em>K</em><sub>0</sub>(<em>X</em>). Upon replacing vector bundles by projective modules, <em>K</em><sub>0</sub> also became defined for non-commutative rings, where it had applications to <a href="group_representation" title="wikilink">group representations</a>. Atiyah and Hirzebruch quickly transported Grothendieck's construction to topology and used it to define <a href="topological_K-theory" title="wikilink">topological K-theory</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Topological <em>K</em>-theory was one of the first examples of an <a href="extraordinary_cohomology_theory" title="wikilink">extraordinary cohomology theory</a>: It associates to each topological space <em>X</em> (satisfying some mild technical constraints) a sequence of groups <em>K</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>X</em>) which satisfy all the <a href="Eilenberg–Steenrod_axioms" title="wikilink">Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms</a> except the normalization axiom. The setting of algebraic varieties, however, is much more rigid, and the flexible constructions used in topology were not available. While the group <em>K</em><sub>0</sub> seemed to satisfy the necessary properties to be the beginning of a cohomology theory of algebraic varieties and of non-commutative rings, there was no clear definition of the higher <em>K</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>X</em>). Even as such definitions were developed, technical issues surrounding restriction and gluing usually forced <em>K</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> to be defined only for rings, not for varieties.</p>

<p>While it was not initially known, a group related to <em>K</em><sub>1</sub> had already been introduced in another context. <a href="Henri_Poincare" title="wikilink">Henri Poincare</a> had attempted to define the Betti numbers of a manifold in terms of a triangulation. His methods, however, had a serious gap: Poincare could not prove that two triangulations of a manifold always yielded the same Betti numbers. It was clearly true that Betti numbers were unchanged by subdividing the triangulation, and therefore it was clear that any two triangulations that shared a common subdivision had the same Betti numbers. What was not known was that any two triangulations admitted a common subdivision. This hypothesis became a conjecture known as the <em><a class="uri" href="Hauptvermutung" title="wikilink">Hauptvermutung</a></em> (roughly "main conjecture"). The fact that triangulations were stable under subdivision led <a href="J.H.C._Whitehead" title="wikilink">J.H.C. Whitehead</a> to introduce the notion of <a href="simple_homotopy_type" title="wikilink">simple homotopy type</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> A simple homotopy equivalence is defined in terms of adding simplices or cells to a <a href="simplicial_complex" title="wikilink">simplicial complex</a> or <a href="cell_complex" title="wikilink">cell complex</a> in such a way that each additional simplex or cell deformation retracts into a subdivision of the old space. Part of the motivation for this definition is that a subdivision of a triangulation is simple homotopy equivalent to the original triangulation, and therefore two triangulations that share a common subdivision must be simple homotopy equivalent. Whitehead proved that simple homotopy equivalence is a finer invariant than homotopy equivalence by introducing an invariant called the <em>torsion</em>. The torsion of a homotopy equivalence takes values in a group now called the <em>Whitehead group</em> and denoted <em>Wh</em>(π), where π is the fundamental group of the two complexes. Whitehead found examples of non-trivial torsion and thereby proved that some homotopy equivalences were not simple. The Whitehead group was later discovered to be a quotient of <em>K</em><sub>1</sub>(<strong>Z</strong>π), where <strong>Z</strong>π is the integral <a href="group_ring" title="wikilink">group ring</a> of π. Later <a href="John_Milnor" title="wikilink">John Milnor</a> used <a href="Reidemeister_torsion" title="wikilink">Reidemeister torsion</a>, an invariant related to Whitehead torsion, to disprove the Hauptvermutung.</p>

<p>The first adequate definition of <em>K</em><sub>1</sub> of a ring was made by <a href="Hyman_Bass" title="wikilink">Hyman Bass</a> and <a href="Stephen_Schanuel" title="wikilink">Stephen Schanuel</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In topological <em>K</em>-theory, <em>K</em><sub>1</sub> is defined using vector bundles on a <a href="suspension_(topology)" title="wikilink">suspension</a> of the space. All such vector bundles come from the <a href="clutching_construction" title="wikilink">clutching construction</a>, where two trivial vector bundles on two halves of a space are glued along a common strip of the space. This gluing data is expressed using the <a href="general_linear_group" title="wikilink">general linear group</a>, but elements of that group coming from elementary matrices (matrices corresponding to elementary row or column operations) define equivalent gluings. Motivated by this, the Bass–Schanuel definition of <em>K</em><sub>1</sub> of a ring <em>R</em> is , where <em>GL</em>(<em>R</em>) is the infinite general linear group (the union of all <em>GL</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>R</em>)) and <em>E</em>(<em>R</em>) is the subgroup of elementary matrices. They also provided a definition of <em>K</em><sub>0</sub> of a homomorphism of rings and proved that <em>K</em><sub>0</sub> and <em>K</em><sub>1</sub> could be fit together into an exact sequence similar to the relative homology exact sequence.</p>

<p>Work in <em>K</em>-theory from this period culminated in Bass' book ''Algebraic <em>K</em>-theory''.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In addition to providing a coherent exposition of the results then known, Bass improved many of the statements of the theorems. Of particular note is that Bass, building on his earlier work with Murthy,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> provided the first proof of what is now known as the <strong>fundamental theorem of algebraic <em>K</em>-theory</strong>. This is a four-term exact sequence relating <em>K</em><sub>0</sub> of a ring <em>R</em> to <em>K</em><sub>1</sub> of <em>R</em>, the polynomial ring <em>R</em>[<em>t</em>], and the localization <em>R</em>[<em>t</em>, <em>t</em><sup>−1</sup>]. Bass recognized that this theorem provided a description of <em>K</em><sub>0</sub> entirely in terms of <em>K</em><sub>1</sub>. By applying this description recursively, he produced negative <em>K</em>-groups <em>K</em><sub>−n</sub>(<em>R</em>). In independent work, <a href="Max_Karoubi" title="wikilink">Max Karoubi</a> gave another definition of negative <em>K</em>-groups for certain categories and proved that his definitions yielded that same groups as those of Bass.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>The next major development in the subject came with the definition of <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>. Steinberg studied the <a href="universal_central_extension" title="wikilink">universal central extensions</a> of a Chevalley group over a field and gave an explicit presentation of this group in terms of generators and relations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In the case of the group E<sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>k</em>) of elementary matrices, the universal central extension is now written St<sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>k</em>) and called the <em>Steinberg group</em>. In the spring of 1967, <a href="John_Milnor" title="wikilink">John Milnor</a> defined <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>(<em>R</em>) to be the kernel of the homomorphism .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The group <em>K</em><sub>2</sub> further extended some of the exact sequences known for <em>K</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>K</em><sub>0</sub>, and it had striking applications to number theory. Matsumoto's 1968 thesis<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> showed that for a field <em>F</em>, <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>(<em>F</em>) was isomorphic to:</p>

 This relation is also satisfied by the <a href="Hilbert_symbol" title="wikilink">Hilbert symbol</a>, which expresses the solvability of quadratic equations over <a href="local_field" title="wikilink">local fields</a>.

<h3 id="higher-k-groups">Higher <em>K</em>-groups</h3>

<p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, several definitions of higher <em>K</em>-theory were proposed. Swan<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and Gersten<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> both produced definitions of <em>K</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> for all <em>n</em>, and Gersten proved that his and Swan's theories were equivalent, but the two theories were not known to satisfy all the expected properties. Nobile and Villamayor also proposed a definition of higher <em>K</em>-groups.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Karoubi and Villamayor defined well-behaved <em>K</em>-groups for all <em>n</em>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> but their equivalent of <em>K</em><sub>1</sub> was sometimes a proper quotient of the Bass–Schanuel <em>K</em><sub>1</sub>. Their <em>K</em>-groups are now called <em>KV</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> and are related to homotopy-invariant modifications of <em>K</em>-theory.</p>

<p>Inspired in part by Matsumoto's theorem, Milnor made a definition of the higher <em>K</em>-groups of a field.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He referred to his definition as "purely <em>ad hoc</em>",<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and it neither appeared to generalize to all rings nor did it appear to be the correct definition of the higher <em>K</em>-theory of fields. Much later, it was discovered by Nesterenko and Suslin<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and by Totaro<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> that Milnor <em>K</em>-theory is actually a direct summand of the true <em>K</em>-theory of the field. Specifically, <em>K</em>-groups have a filtration called the <em>weight filtration</em>, and the Milnor <em>K</em>-theory of a field is the highest weight-graded piece of the <em>K</em>-theory. Additionally, Thomason discovered that there is no analog of Milnor <em>K</em>-theory for a general variety.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>The first definition of higher <em>K</em>-theory to be widely accepted was <a href="Daniel_Quillen" title="wikilink">Daniel Quillen</a>'s.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> As part of Quillen's work on the <a href="Adams_conjecture" title="wikilink">Adams conjecture</a> in topology, he had constructed maps from the <a href="classifying_space" title="wikilink">classifying spaces</a> <em>BGL</em>(<strong>F</strong><sub><em>q</em></sub>) to the homotopy fiber of <mtpl></mtpl>, where ψ<sup><em>q</em></sup> is the <em>q</em>th <a href="Adams_operation" title="wikilink">Adams operation</a> acting on the classifying space <em>BU</em>. This map is acyclic, and after modifying <em>BGL</em>(<strong>F</strong><sub><em>q</em></sub>) slightly to produce a new space <em>BGL</em>(<strong>F</strong><sub><em>q</em></sub>)<sup>+</sup>, the map became a homotopy equivalence. This modification was called the <a href="plus_construction" title="wikilink">plus construction</a>. The Adams operations had been known to be related to Chern classes and to <em>K</em>-theory since the work of Grothendieck, and so Quillen was led to define the <em>K</em>-theory of <em>R</em> as the homotopy groups of <em>BGL</em>(<em>R</em>)<sup>+</sup>. Not only did this recover <em>K</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>, the relation of <em>K</em>-theory to the Adams operations allowed Quillen to compute the <em>K</em>-groups of finite fields.</p>

<p>The classifying space <em>BGL</em> is connected, so Quillen's definition failed to give the correct value for <em>K</em><sub>0</sub>. Additionally, it did not give any negative <em>K</em>-groups. Since <em>K</em><sub>0</sub> had a known and accepted definition it was possible to sidestep this difficulty, but it remained technically awkward. Conceptually, the problem was that the definition sprung from <em>GL</em>, which was classically the source of <em>K</em><sub>1</sub>. Because <em>GL</em> knows only about gluing vector bundles, not about the vector bundles themselves, it was impossible for it to describe <em>K</em><sub>0</sub>.</p>

<p>Inspired by conversations with Quillen, Segal soon introduced another approach to constructing algebraic <em>K</em>-theory under the name of Γ-objects.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Segal's approach is a homotopy analog of Grothendieck's construction of <em>K</em><sub>0</sub>. Where Grothendieck worked with isomorphism classes of bundles, Segal worked with the bundles themselves and used isomorphisms of the bundles as part of his data. This results in a <a href="spectrum_(topology)" title="wikilink">spectrum</a> whose homotopy groups are the higher <em>K</em>-groups (including <em>K</em><sub>0</sub>). However, Segal's approach was only able to impose relations for split exact sequences, not general exact sequences. In the category of projective modules over a ring, every short exact sequence splits, and so Γ-objects could be used to define the <em>K</em>-theory of a ring. However, there are non-split short exact sequences in the category of vector bundles on a variety and in the category of all modules over a ring, so Segal's approach did not apply to all cases of interest.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1972, Quillen found another approach to the construction of higher <em>K</em>-theory which was to prove enormously successful. This new definition began with an <a href="exact_category" title="wikilink">exact category</a>, a category satisfying certain formal properties similar to, but slightly weaker than, the properties satisfied by a category of modules or vector bundles. From this he constructed an auxiliary category using a new device called his "<a href="Q-construction" title="wikilink"><em>Q</em>-construction</a>." Like Segal's Γ-objects, the <em>Q</em>-construction has its roots in Grothendieck's definition of <em>K</em><sub>0</sub>. Unlike Grothendieck's definition, however, the <em>Q</em>-construction builds a category, not an abelian group, and unlike Segal's Γ-objects, the <em>Q</em>-construction works directly with short exact sequences. If <em>C</em> is an abelian category, then <em>QC</em> is a category with the same objects as <em>C</em> but whose morphisms are defined in terms of short exact sequences in <em>C</em>. The <em>K</em>-groups of the exact category are the homotopy groups of Ω<em>BQC</em>, the <a href="loop_space" title="wikilink">loop space</a> of the <a href="geometric_realization" title="wikilink">geometric realization</a> (taking the loop space corrects the indexing). Quillen additionally proved his " theorem" that his two definitions of <em>K</em>-theory agreed with each other. This yielded the correct <em>K</em><sub>0</sub> and led to simpler proofs, but still did not yield any negative <em>K</em>-groups.</p>

<p>All abelian categories are exact categories, but not all exact categories are abelian. Because Quillen was able to work in this more general situation, he was able to use exact categories as tools in his proofs. This technique allowed him to prove many of the basic theorems of algebraic <em>K</em>-theory. Additionally, it was possible to prove that the earlier definitions of Swan and Gersten were equivalent to Quillen's under certain conditions.</p>

<p><em>K</em>-theory now appeared to be a homology theory for rings and a cohomology theory for varieties. However, many of its basic theorems carried the hypothesis that the ring or variety in question was regular. One of the basic expected relations was a long exact sequence (called the "localization sequence") relating the <em>K</em>-theory of a variety <em>X</em> and an open subset <em>U</em>. Quillen was unable to prove the existence of the localization sequence in full generality. He was, however, able to prove its existence for a related theory called <em>G</em>-theory (or sometimes <em>K</em>′-theory). <em>G</em>-theory had been defined early in the development of the subject by Grothendieck. Grothendieck defined <em>G</em><sub>0</sub>(<em>X</em>) for a variety <em>X</em> to be the free abelian group on isomorphism classes of coherent sheaves on <em>X</em>, modulo relations coming from exact sequences of coherent sheaves. In the categorical framework adopted by later authors, the <em>K</em>-theory of a variety is the <em>K</em>-theory of its category of vector bundles, while its <em>G</em>-theory is the <em>K</em>-theory of its category of coherent sheaves. Not only could Quillen prove the existence of a localization exact sequence for <em>G</em>-theory, he could prove that for a regular ring or variety, <em>K</em>-theory equaled <em>G</em>-theory, and therefore <em>K</em>-theory of regular varieties had a localization exact sequence. Since this sequence was fundamental to many of the facts in the subject, regularity hypotheses pervaded early work on higher <em>K</em>-theory.</p>
<h3 id="applications-of-algebraic-k-theory-in-topology">Applications of algebraic <em>K</em>-theory in topology</h3>

<p>The earliest application of algebraic <em>K</em>-theory to topology was Whitehead's construction of Whitehead torsion. A closely related construction was found by <a href="C._T._C._Wall" title="wikilink">C. T. C. Wall</a> in 1963.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Wall found that a space π dominated by a finite complex has a generalized Euler characteristic taking values in a quotient of <em>K</em><sub>0</sub>(<strong>Z</strong>π), where π is the fundamental group of the space. This invariant is called <em>Wall's finiteness obstruction</em> because <em>X</em> is homotopy equivalent to a finite complex if and only if the invariant vanishes. <a href="Laurent_Siebenmann" title="wikilink">Laurent Siebenmann</a> in his thesis found an invariant similar to Wall's that gives an obstruction to an open manifold being the interior of a compact manifold with boundary.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> If two manifolds with boundary <em>M</em> and <em>N</em> have isomorphic interiors (in TOP, PL, or DIFF as appropriate), then the isomorphism between them defines an <em>h</em>-cobordism between <em>M</em> and <em>N</em>.</p>

<p>Whitehead torsion was eventually reinterpreted in a more directly <em>K</em>-theoretic way. This reinterpretation happened through the study of <a href="h-cobordism" title="wikilink"><em>h</em>-cobordisms</a>. Two <em>n</em>-dimensional manifolds <em>M</em> and <em>N</em> are <em>h</em>-cobordant if there exists an -dimensional manifold with boundary <em>W</em> whose boundary is the disjoint union of <em>M</em> and <em>N</em> and for which the inclusions of <em>M</em> and <em>N</em> into <em>W</em> are homotopy equivalences (in the categories TOP, PL, or DIFF). <a href="Stephen_Smale" title="wikilink">Stephen Smale</a>'s <em>h</em>-cobordism theorem<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> asserted that if , <em>W</em> is compact, and <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>, and <em>W</em> are simply connected, then <em>W</em> is isomorphic to the cylinder  (in TOP, PL, or DIFF as appropriate). This theorem proved the <a href="Poincare_conjecture" title="wikilink">Poincare conjecture</a> for .</p>

<p>If <em>M</em> and <em>N</em> are not assumed to be simply connected, then an <em>h</em>-cobordism need not be a cylinder. The <em>s</em>-cobordism theorem, due independently to Mazur,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Stallings, and Barden,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> explains the general situation: An <em>h</em>-cobordism is a cylinder if and only if the Whitehead torsion of the inclusion  vanishes. This generalizes the <em>h</em>-cobordism theorem because the simple connectedness hypotheses imply that the relevant Whitehead group is trivial. In fact the <em>s</em>-cobordism theorem implies that there is a bijective correspondence between isomorphism classes of <em>h</em>-cobordisms and elements of the Whitehead group.</p>

<p>An obvious question associated with the existence of <em>h</em>-cobordisms is their uniqueness. The natural notion of equivalence is <a href="homotopy#isotopy" title="wikilink">isotopy</a>. <a href="Jean_Cerf" title="wikilink">Jean Cerf</a> proved that for simply connected smooth manifolds <em>M</em> of dimension at least 5, isotopy of <em>h</em>-cobordisms is the same as a weaker notion called pseudo-isotopy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Hatcher and Wagoner studied the components of the space of pseudo-isotopies and related it to a quotient of <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>(<strong>Z</strong>π).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p>The proper context for the <em>s</em>-cobordism theorem is the classifying space of <em>h</em>-cobordisms. If <em>M</em> is a CAT manifold, then <em>H</em><sup>CAT</sup>(<em>M</em>) is a space that classifies bundles of <em>h</em>-cobordisms on <em>M</em>. The <em>s</em>-cobordism theorem can be reinterpreted as the statement that the set of connected components of this space is the Whitehead group of π<sub>1</sub>(<em>M</em>). This space contains strictly more information than the Whitehead group; for example, the connected component of the trivial cobordism describes the possible cylinders on <em>M</em> and in particular is the obstruction to the uniqueness of a homotopy between a manifold and . Consideration of these questions led Waldhausen to introduced his ''algebraic <em>K</em>-theory of spaces''.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The algebraic <em>K</em>-theory of <em>M</em> is a space <em>A</em>(<em>M</em>) which is defined so that it plays essentially the same role for higher <em>K</em>-groups as <em>K</em><sub>1</sub>(<strong>Z</strong>π<sub>1</sub>(<em>M</em>)) does for <em>M</em>. In particular, Waldhausen showed that there is a map from <em>A</em>(<em>M</em>) to a space Wh(<em>M</em>) which generalizes the map <mtpl></mtpl> and whose homotopy fiber is a homology theory.</p>

<p>In order to fully develop <em>A</em>-theory, Waldhausen made significant technical advances in the foundations of <em>K</em>-theory. Waldhausen introduced <a href="Waldhausen_category" title="wikilink">Waldhausen categories</a>, and for a Waldhausen category <em>C</em> he introduced a simplicial category <em>S</em><sub>·</sub><em>C</em> (the <em>S</em> is for Segal) defined in terms of chains of cofibrations in <em>C</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> This freed the foundations of <em>K</em>-theory from the need to invoke analogs of exact sequences.</p>

<p>Quillen suggested to his student <a href="Kenneth_Brown_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Kenneth Brown</a> that it might be possible to create a theory of <a href="sheaf_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">sheaves</a> of <a href="spectrum_(algebraic_topology)" title="wikilink">spectra</a> of which <em>K</em>-theory would provide an example. The sheaf of <em>K</em>-theory spectra would, to each open subset of a variety, associate the <em>K</em>-theory of that open subset. Brown developed such a theory for his thesis. Simultaneously, Gersten had the same idea. At a Seattle conference in autumn of 1972, they together discovered a <a href="spectral_sequence" title="wikilink">spectral sequence</a> converging from the sheaf cohomology of

 for all <em>p</em>. This is known as <em>Bloch's formula</em>. While progress has been made on Gersten's conjecture since then, the general case remains open.</p>

<p>Lichtenbaum conjectured that special values of the <a href="zeta_function" title="wikilink">zeta function</a> of a number field could be expressed in terms of the <em>K</em>-groups of the ring of integers of the field. These special values were known to be related to the <a href="etale_cohomology" title="wikilink">etale cohomology</a> of the ring of integers. Quillen therefore generalized Lichtenbaum's conjecture, predicting the existence of a spectral sequence like the <a href="Atiyah–Hirzebruch_spectral_sequence" title="wikilink">Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence</a> in topological <em>K</em>-theory.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Quillen's proposed spectral sequence would start from the etale cohomology of a ring <em>R</em> and, in high enough degrees and after completing at a prime ℓ invertible in <em>R</em>, abut to the ℓ-adic completion of the <em>K</em>-theory of <em>R</em>. In the case studied by Lichtenbaum, the spectral sequence would degenerate, yielding Lichtenbaum's conjecture.</p>

<p>The necessity of localizing at a prime ℓ suggested to Browder that there should be a variant of <em>K</em>-theory with finite coefficients.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He introduced <em>K</em>-theory groups <em>K</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>R</em>; <strong>Z</strong>/ℓ<strong>Z</strong>) which were <strong>Z</strong>/ℓ<strong>Z</strong>-vector spaces, and he found an analog of the Bott element in topological <em>K</em>-theory. Soule used this theory to construct "etale <a href="Chern_class" title="wikilink">Chern classes</a>", an analog of topological Chern classes which took elements of algebraic <em>K</em>-theory to classes in <a href="etale_cohomology" title="wikilink">etale cohomology</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Unlike algebraic <em>K</em>-theory, etale cohomology is highly computable, so etale Chern classes provided an effective tool for detecting the existence of elements in <em>K</em>-theory. Dwyer and Friedlander then invented an analog of <em>K</em>-theory for the etale topology called etale <em>K</em>-theory.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> For varieties defined over the complex numbers, etale <em>K</em>-theory is isomorphic to topological <em>K</em>-theory. Moreover, etale <em>K</em>-theory theory admitted a spectral sequence similar to the one conjectured by Quillen. Thomason proved around 1980 that after inverting the Bott element, algebraic <em>K</em>-theory with finite coefficients became isomorphic to etale <em>K</em>-theory.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, <em>K</em>-theory on singular varieties still lacked adequate foundations. While it was believed that Quillen's <em>K</em>-theory gave the correct groups, it was not known that these groups had all of the envisaged properties. For this, algebraic <em>K</em>-theory had to be reformulated. This was done by Thomason in a lengthy monograph which he co-credited to his dead friend Thomas Trobaugh, whom he said gave him a key idea in a dream.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Thomason combined Waldhausen's construction of <em>K</em>-theory with the foundations of intersection theory described in volume six of Grothendieck's <a href="Séminaire_de_Géométrie_Algébrique_du_Bois_Marie" title="wikilink">Séminaire de Géométrie Algébrique du Bois Marie</a>. There, <em>K</em><sub>0</sub> was described in terms of complexes of sheaves on algebraic varieties. Thomason discovered that if one worked with in <a href="derived_category" title="wikilink">derived category</a> of sheaves, there was a simple description of when a complex of sheaves could be extended from an open subset of a variety to the whole variety. By applying Waldhausen's construction of <em>K</em>-theory to derived categories, Thomason was able to prove that algebraic <em>K</em>-theory had all the expected properties of a cohomology theory.</p>

<p>In 1976, Keith Dennis discovered an entirely novel technique for computing <em>K</em>-theory based on <a href="Hochschild_homology" title="wikilink">Hochschild homology</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> This was based around the existence of the Dennis trace map, a homomorphism from <em>K</em>-theory to Hochschild homology. While the Dennis trace map seemed to be successful for calculations of <em>K</em>-theory with finite coefficients, it was less successful for rational calculations. Goodwillie, motivated by his "calculus of functors", conjectured the existence of a theory intermediate to <em>K</em>-theory and Hochschild homology. He called this theory topological Hochschild homology because its ground ring should be the sphere spectrum (considered as a ring whose operations are defined only up to homotopy). In the mid-80s, Bokstedt gave a definition of topological Hochschild homology that satisfied nearly all of Goodwillie's conjectural properties, and this made possible further computations of <em>K</em>-groups.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Bokstedt's version of the Dennis trace map was a transformation of spectra . This transformation factored through the fixed points of a circle action on <em>THH</em>, which suggested a relationship with <a href="cyclic_homology" title="wikilink">cyclic homology</a>. In the course of proving an algebraic <em>K</em>-theory analog of the <a href="Novikov_conjecture" title="wikilink">Novikov conjecture</a>, Bokstedt, Hsiang, and Madsen introduced topological cyclic homology, which bore the same relationship to topological Hochschild homology as cyclic homology did to Hochschild homology.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The Dennis trace map to topological Hochschild homology facts through topological cyclic homology, providing an even more detailed tool for calculations. In 1996, Dundas, Goodwillie, and McCarthy proved that topological cyclic homology has in a precise sense the same local structure as algebraic <em>K</em>-theory, so that if a calculation in <em>K</em>-theory or topological cyclic homology is possible, then many other "nearby" calculations follow.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>For <em>A</em> a <a href="commutative_ring" title="wikilink">commutative ring</a>, one can define a determinant det: GL(<em>A</em>) → <em>A*</em> to the <a href="group_of_units" title="wikilink">group of units</a> of <em>A</em>, which vanishes on E(<em>A</em>) and thus descends to a map det: <em>K<sub>1</sub>(A)</em> → <em>A*</em>. As E(<em>A</em>) ◅ SL(<em>A</em>), one can also define the <strong>special Whitehead group</strong> SK<sub>1</sub>(<em>A</em>) := SL(<em>A</em>)/E(<em>A</em>). This map splits via the map <em>A*</em> → GL(1, <em>A</em>) → <em>K<sub>1</sub>(A)</em> (unit in the upper left corner), and hence is onto, and has the special Whitehead group as kernel, yielding the <a href="split_short_exact_sequence" title="wikilink">split short exact sequence</a>:</p>

<p>The determinant is split by including the group of units <em>A*</em> = GL<sub>1</sub>(<em>A</em>) into the general linear group GL<em>(A)</em>, so <em>K<sub>1</sub>(A)</em> splits as the direct sum of the group of units and the special Whitehead group: <em>K<sub>1</sub>(A)</em> ≅ <em>A*</em> ⊕ SK<sub>1</sub> (<em>A</em>).</p>

<p>When <em>A</em> is a Euclidean domain (e.g. a field, or the integers) SK<sub>1</sub>(<em>A</em>) vanishes, and the determinant map is an isomorphism from K<sub>1</sub>(<em>A</em>) to <em>A</em><sup>∗</sup>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> This is <em>false</em> in general for PIDs, thus providing one of the rare mathematical features of Euclidean domains that do not generalize to all PIDs. An explicit PID such that SK<sub>1</sub> is nonzero was given by Ischebeck in 1980 and by Grayson in 1981.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> If <em>A</em> is a Dedekind domain whose quotient field is an <a href="algebraic_number_field" title="wikilink">algebraic number field</a> (a finite extension of the rationals) then  shows that SK<sub>1</sub>(<em>A</em>) vanishes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p>The vanishing of SK<sub>1</sub> can be interpreted as saying that K<sub>1</sub> is generated by the image of GL<sub>1</sub> in GL. When this fails, one can ask whether K<sub>1</sub> is generated by the image of GL<sub>2</sub>. For a Dedekind domain, this is the case: indeed, K<sub>1</sub> is generated by the images of GL<sub>1</sub> and SL<sub>2</sub> in GL.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The subgroup of SK<sub>1</sub> generated by SL<sub>2</sub> may be studied by <a href="Mennicke_symbol" title="wikilink">Mennicke symbols</a>. For Dedekind domains with all quotients by maximal ideals finite, SK<sub>1</sub> is a torsion group.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<p>For a non-commutative ring, the determinant cannot in general be defined, but the map GL(<em>A</em>) → <em>K</em><sub>1</sub>(<em>A</em>) is a generalisation of the determinant.</p>
<h4 id="central-simple-algebras">Central simple algebras</h4>

<p>In the case of a <a href="central_simple_algebra" title="wikilink">central simple algebra</a> <em>A</em> over a field <em>F</em>, the <a href="reduced_norm" title="wikilink">reduced norm</a> provides a generalisation of the determinant giving a map <em>K</em><sub>1</sub>(<em>A</em>) → <em>F</em><sup>∗</sup> and SK<sub>1</sub>(<em>A</em>) may be defined as the kernel. <strong>Wang's theorem</strong> states that if <em>A</em> has prime degree then SK<sub>1</sub>(<em>A</em>) is trivial,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> and this may be extended to square-free degree.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> <a href="Shianghao_Wang" title="wikilink">Wang</a> also showed that SK<sub>1</sub>(<em>A</em>) is trivial for any central simple algebra over a number field,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> but Platonov has given examples of algebras of degree prime squared for which SK<sub>1</sub>(<em>A</em>) is non-trivial.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p>Matsumoto's original theorem is even more general: For any <a href="root_system" title="wikilink">root system</a>, it gives a presentation for the unstable K-theory. This presentation is different from the one given here only for symplectic root systems. For non-symplectic root systems, the unstable second K-group with respect to the root system is exactly the stable K-group for GL(<em>A</em>). Unstable second K-groups (in this context) are defined by taking the kernel of the universal central extension of the <a href="Chevalley_group" title="wikilink">Chevalley group</a> of universal type for a given root system. This construction yields the kernel of the Steinberg extension for the root systems <em>A</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> (<em>n</em> &gt; 1) and, in the limit, stable second <em>K</em>-groups.</p>

<p>The Q-construction gives the same results as the +-construction, but it applies in more general situations.

<p>with a fixed zero-object 0, where B<em>QP</em> is the <em>classifying space</em> of <em>QP</em>, which is defined to be the <a href="geometric_realisation" title="wikilink">geometric realisation</a> of the <em><a href="Nerve_(category_theory)" title="wikilink">nerve</a></em> of <em>QP</em>.</p>

<p>This definition coincides with the above definition of <em>K</em><sub>0</sub>(<em>P</em>). If <em>P</em> is the category of finitely generated <a href="projective_module" title="wikilink">projective <em>R</em>-modules</a>, this definition agrees with the above <em>BGL<sup>+</sup></em> definition of <em>K</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>R</em>) for all <em>n</em>.</p>

<p>More generally, for a <a href="scheme_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">scheme</a> <em>X</em>, the higher <em>K</em>-groups of <em>X</em> are defined to be the <em>K</em>-groups of (the exact category of) locally free <a href="Coherent_sheaf" title="wikilink">coherent sheaves</a> on <em>X</em>.</p>

<p>The following variant of this is also used: instead of finitely generated projective (= locally free) modules, take finitely generated modules. The resulting <em>K</em>-groups are usually written <em>G</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>R</em>). When <em>R</em> is a <a href="noetherian_ring" title="wikilink">noetherian</a> <a href="regular_ring" title="wikilink">regular ring</a>, then <em>G</em>- and <em>K</em>-theory coincide. Indeed, the <a href="global_dimension" title="wikilink">global dimension</a> of regular rings is finite, i.e. any finitely generated module has a finite projective resolution <em>P</em><sub>*</sub> → <em>M</em>, and a simple argument shows that the canonical map <em>K</em><sub>0</sub>(R) → <em>G</em><sub>0</sub>(R) is an <a class="uri" href="isomorphism" title="wikilink">isomorphism</a>, with [<em>M</em>]=Σ ± [<em>P</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>]. This isomorphism extends to the higher <em>K</em>-groups, too.</p>
<h3 id="the-s-construction">The S-construction</h3>

<p>A third construction of <em>K</em>-theory groups is the S-construction, due to <a href="Friedhelm_Waldhausen" title="wikilink">Waldhausen</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn89" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> It applies to categories with cofibrations (also called <a href="Waldhausen_category" title="wikilink">Waldhausen categories</a>). This is a more general concept than exact categories.</p>
<h2 id="examples-1">Examples</h2>

<p>While the Quillen algebraic <em>K</em>-theory has provided deep insight into various aspects of algebraic geometry and topology, the <em>K</em>-groups have proved particularly difficult to compute except in a few isolated but interesting cases.</p>
<h3 id="algebraic-k-groups-of-finite-fields">Algebraic K-groups of finite fields</h3>

<p>The first and one of the most important calculations of the higher algebraic <em>K</em>-groups of a ring were made by Quillen himself for the case of <a href="finite_field" title="wikilink">finite fields</a>:</p>

<p>If <strong>F</strong><sub><em>q</em></sub> is the finite field with <em>q</em> elements, then:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>K</em><sub>0</sub>(<strong>F</strong><sub><em>q</em></sub>) = <strong>Z</strong>,</li>
<li><em>K</em><sub>2<em>i</em></sub>(<strong>F</strong><sub><em>q</em></sub>) = 0 for <em>i</em> ≥1,</li>
<li><em>K</em><sub>2<em>i</em>–1</sub>(<strong>F</strong><sub><em>q</em></sub>) = <strong>Z</strong>/(<em>q</em><sup> <em>i</em></sup> − 1)<strong>Z</strong> for <em>i</em> ≥ 1.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="algebraic-k-groups-of-rings-of-integers">Algebraic K-groups of rings of integers</h3>

<p>Quillen proved that if <em>A</em> is the <a href="ring_of_integers" title="wikilink">ring of algebraic integers</a> in an algebraic <a href="number_field" title="wikilink">number field</a> <em>F</em> (a finite extension of the rationals), then the algebraic K-groups of <em>A</em> are finitely generated. <a href="Armand_Borel" title="wikilink">Borel</a> used this to calculate <em>K</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>(<em>A</em>) and K<sub><em>i</em></sub>(<em>F</em>) modulo torsion. For example, for the integers <strong>Z</strong>, Borel proved that (modulo torsion)</p>
<ul>
<li><em>K</em><sub>i</sub> (<strong>Z</strong>)/tors.=0 for positive <em>i</em> unless <em>i=4k+1</em> with <em>k</em> positive</li>
<li><em>K</em><sub>4<em>k</em>+1</sub> (<strong>Z</strong>)/tors.= <strong>Z</strong> for positive <em>k</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The torsion subgroups of K<sub>2<em>i</em>+1</sub>(<strong>Z</strong>), and the orders of the finite groups K<sub>4<em>k</em>+2</sub>(<strong>Z</strong>) have recently been determined, but whether the latter groups are cyclic, and whether the groups <em>K</em><sub>4<em>k</em></sub>(<strong>Z</strong>) vanish depends upon <a href="Vandiver's_conjecture" title="wikilink">Vandiver's conjecture</a> about the class groups of cyclotomic integers. See <a href="Quillen–Lichtenbaum_conjecture" title="wikilink">Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="applications-and-open-questions">Applications and open questions</h2>

<p>Algebraic <em>K</em>-groups are used in conjectures on <a href="special_values_of_L-functions" title="wikilink">special values of L-functions</a> and the formulation of an <a href="non-commutative_main_conjecture_of_Iwasawa_theory" title="wikilink">non-commutative main conjecture of Iwasawa theory</a> and in construction of <a href="higher_regulator" title="wikilink">higher regulators</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn90" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Parshin's_conjecture" title="wikilink">Parshin's conjecture</a> concerns the higher algebraic <em>K</em>-groups for smooth varieties over finite fields, and states that in this case the groups vanish up to torsion.</p>

<p>Another fundamental conjecture due to <a href="Hyman_Bass" title="wikilink">Hyman Bass</a> (<a href="Bass'_conjecture" title="wikilink">Bass' conjecture</a>) says that all of the groups <em>G<sub>n</sub>(A)</em> are finitely generated when <em>A</em> is a finitely generated <strong>Z</strong>-algebra. (The groups <em>G<sub>n</sub>(A)</em> are the <em>K</em>-groups of the category of finitely generated <em>A</em>-modules) <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn91" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
