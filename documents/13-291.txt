   Real-valued function      Real-valued function   In mathematics, a real-valued function or real function is a function whose values are real numbers . In other words, it is a function that assigns a real number to each member of its domain .  Many important function spaces are defined to consist of real functions.  In general  Let   X   X   X   be an arbitrary set . Let    ‚Ñ±   (  X  ,  ‚Ñù  )       ‚Ñ±   X  ‚Ñù     {\mathcal{F}}(X,{\mathbb{R}})   denote the set of all functions from   X   X   X   to real numbers   ùêë   ùêë   \mathbf{R}   . Because   ùêë   ùêë   \mathbf{R}   is a field ,    ‚Ñ±   (  X  ,  ‚Ñù  )       ‚Ñ±   X  ‚Ñù     {\mathcal{F}}(X,{\mathbb{R}})   is a vector space and a commutative algebra (structure) over reals:         f   +  g   :   x  ‚Ü¶    f   (  x  )    +   g   (  x  )         normal-:    f  g    maps-to  x      f  x     g  x       \ f+g:x\mapsto f(x)+g(x)   ‚Äì vector addition      0  :   x  ‚Ü¶  0      normal-:  0   maps-to  x  0     \ \mathbf{0}:x\mapsto 0   ‚Äì additive identity        c   f   :    x  ‚Ü¶   c  f   (  x  )     ,   c  ‚àà  ‚Ñù       normal-:    c  f    formulae-sequence   maps-to  x    c  f  x      c  ‚Ñù      \ cf:x\mapsto cf(x),\quad c\in{\mathbb{R}}   ‚Äì scalar multiplication        f   g   :   x  ‚Ü¶   f   (  x  )   g   (  x  )        normal-:    f  g    maps-to  x    f  x  g  x      \ fg:x\mapsto f(x)g(x)   ‚Äì pointwise multiplication   Also, since   ùêë   ùêë   \mathbf{R}   is an ordered set, there is a partial order on    ‚Ñ±   (  X  ,  ‚Ñù  )       ‚Ñ±   X  ‚Ñù     {\mathcal{F}}(X,{\mathbb{R}})   :         f   ‚â§   g  ‚áî   ‚àÄ  x     :    f   (  x  )    ‚â§   g   (  x  )        normal-:    f   g  iff   for-all  x         f  x     g  x      \ f\leq g\quad\iff\quad\forall x:f(x)\leq g(x)   .       ‚Ñ±   (  X  ,  ‚Ñù  )       ‚Ñ±   X  ‚Ñù     {\mathcal{F}}(X,{\mathbb{R}})   is a partially ordered ring .  Measurable  The œÉ-algebra of Borel sets is an important structure on real numbers. If   X   X   X   has its œÉ-algebra and a function   f   f   f   is such that the preimage  of any Borel set   B   B   B   belongs to that œÉ-algebra, then   f   f   f   is said to be measurable . Measurable functions also form a vector space and an algebra as explained above .  Moreover, a set (family) of real-valued functions on   X   X   X   can actually define a œÉ-algebra on   X   X   X   generated by all preimages of all Borel sets (or of intervals only, it is not important). This is the way how œÉ-algebras arise in ( Kolmogorov's ) probability theory , where real-valued functions on the sample space    Œ©   normal-Œ©   Œ©   are real-valued random variables .  Continuous  Real numbers form a topological space and a complete metric space . Continuous real-valued functions (which implies that   X   X   X   is a topological space) are important in theories of topological spaces and of metric spaces . The extreme value theorem states that for any real continuous function on a compact space its global maximum and minimum exist.  The concept of metric space itself is defined with a real-valued function of two variables, the metric , which is continuous. The space of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space has a particular importance. Convergent sequences also can be considered as real-valued continuous functions on a special topological space.  Continuous functions also form a vector space and an algebra as explained above , and are a subclass of measurable functions because any topological space has the œÉ-algebra generated by open (or closed) sets.  Smooth  Real numbers are used as the codomain to define smooth functions. A domain of a real smooth function can be the real coordinate space (which yields a real multivariable function ), a topological vector space , 1 an open subset of them, or a smooth manifold .  Spaces of smooth functions also are vector spaces and algebras as explained above , and are a subclass of continuous functions .  Appearances in measure theory  A measure on a set is a non-negative real-valued functional on a œÉ-algebra of subsets. 2  L p spaces on sets with a measure are defined from aforementioned real-valued measurable functions , although they are actually quotient spaces . More precisely, whereas a function satisfying an appropriate summability condition defines an element of L p space, in the opposite direction for any and    x  ‚àà  X      x  normal-‚àà  X    x‚ààX   which is not an atom , the value    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   is undefined . Though, real-valued L p spaces still have some of the structure explicated above . Each of L p spaces is a vector space and have a partial order, and there exists a pointwise multiplication of "functions" which changes   p   p   p   , namely       \sdot   :      L   1  /  Œ±    √ó   L   1  /  Œ≤     ‚Üí   L   1  /   (   Œ±  +  Œ≤   )      ,    0  ‚â§  Œ±   ,    Œ≤  ‚â§  1   ,    Œ±  +  Œ≤   ‚â§  1.         normal-:  \sdot   formulae-sequence   normal-‚Üí     superscript  L    1  Œ±     superscript  L    1  Œ≤      superscript  L    1    Œ±  Œ≤       formulae-sequence    0  Œ±    formulae-sequence    Œ≤  1       Œ±  Œ≤   1.        \sdot:L^{1/\alpha}\times L^{1/\beta}\to L^{1/(\alpha+\beta)},\quad 0\leq\alpha%
 ,\beta\leq 1,\quad\alpha+\beta\leq 1.   For example, pointwise product of two L 2 functions belongs to L 1 .  Other appearances  Other contexts where real-valued functions and their special properties are used include monotonic functions (on ordered sets ), convex functions (on vector and affine spaces ), harmonic and subharmonic functions (on Riemannian manifolds ), analytic functions (usually of one or more real variables), algebraic functions (on real algebraic varieties ), and polynomials (of one or more real variables).
