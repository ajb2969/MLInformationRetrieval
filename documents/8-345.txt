   Limit set      Limit set   In mathematics , especially in the study of dynamical systems , a limit set is the state a dynamical system reaches after an infinite amount of time has passed, by either going forward or backwards in time. Limit sets are important because they can be used to understand the long term behavior of a dynamical system.  Types   fixed points  periodic orbits  limit cycles  attractors .   In general limits sets can be very complicated as in the case of strange attractors , but for 2-dimensional dynamical systems the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem provides a simple characterization of all possible limit sets as a union of fixed points and periodic orbits.  Definition for iterated functions  Let   X   X   X   be a metric space , and let    f  :   X  →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  X     f:X\rightarrow X   be a continuous function . The   ω   ω   \omega   -limit set of    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   , denoted by    ω   (  x  ,  f  )       ω   x  f     \omega(x,f)   , is the set of cluster points of the forward orbit     {    f  n    (  x  )    }    n  ∈  ℕ      subscript      superscript  f  n   x      n  ℕ     \{f^{n}(x)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}   of the iterated function    f   f   f   . Hence,    y  ∈   ω   (  x  ,  f  )        y    ω   x  f      y\in\omega(x,f)    if and only if there is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers     {   n  k   }    k  ∈  ℕ      subscript    subscript  n  k      k  ℕ     \{n_{k}\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}   such that      f   n  k     (  x  )    →  y     normal-→     superscript  f   subscript  n  k    x   y    f^{n_{k}}(x)\rightarrow y   as    k  →  ∞     normal-→  k     k\rightarrow\infty   . Another way to express this is        ω   (  x  ,  f  )    =    ⋂   n  ∈  ℕ      {    f  k    (  x  )    :   k  >  n   }   ¯     ,        ω   x  f      subscript     n  ℕ     normal-¯   conditional-set     superscript  f  k   x     k  n        \omega(x,f)=\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\overline{\{f^{k}(x):k>n\}},     where    S  ¯     normal-¯  S    \overline{S}   denotes the closure of set   S   S   S   . The closure is here needed, since we have not assumed that the underlying metric space of interest to be a complete metric space . The points in the limit set are non-wandering (but may not be recurrent points ). This may also be formulated as the outer limit ( limsup ) of a sequence of sets, such that        ω   (  x  ,  f  )    =    ⋂   n  =  1   ∞      ⋃   k  =  n   ∞    {    f  k    (  x  )    }    ¯     .        ω   x  f      superscript   subscript     n  1       normal-¯    superscript   subscript     k  n          superscript  f  k   x         \omega(x,f)=\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}\overline{\bigcup_{k=n}^{\infty}\{f^{k}(x)\}}.     If   f   f   f   is a homeomorphism (that is, a bicontinuous bijection), then the   α   α   \alpha   -limit set is defined in a similar fashion, but for the backward orbit; i.e.      α   (  x  ,  f  )    =   ω   (  x  ,   f   -  1    )          α   x  f      ω   x   superscript  f    1        \alpha(x,f)=\omega(x,f^{-1})   .  Both sets are   f   f   f   -invariant, and if   X   X   X   is compact , they are compact and nonempty.  Definition for flows  Given a real dynamical system ( T , X , φ) with flow     φ  :    ℝ  ×  X   →  X      normal-:  φ   normal-→    ℝ  X   X     \varphi:\mathbb{R}\times X\to X   , a point x and an orbit γ through x , we call a point y an ω- limit point of x if there exists a sequence     (   t  n   )    n  ∈  ℕ      subscript   subscript  t  n     n  ℕ     (t_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}   in R so that        lim   n  →  ∞     t  n    =  ∞        subscript    normal-→  n      subscript  t  n       \lim_{n\to\infty}t_{n}=\infty           lim   n  →  ∞     φ   (   t  n   ,  x  )     =  y        subscript    normal-→  n       φ    subscript  t  n   x     y    \lim_{n\to\infty}\varphi(t_{n},x)=y   .  Analogously we call y an α- limit point of x if there exists a sequence     (   t  n   )    n  ∈  ℕ      subscript   subscript  t  n     n  ℕ     (t_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}   in R so that        lim   n  →  ∞     t  n    =   -  ∞         subscript    normal-→  n      subscript  t  n          \lim_{n\to\infty}t_{n}=-\infty           lim   n  →  ∞     φ   (   t  n   ,  x  )     =  y        subscript    normal-→  n       φ    subscript  t  n   x     y    \lim_{n\to\infty}\varphi(t_{n},x)=y   .  The set of all ω-limit points (α-limit points) for a given orbit γ is called ω- limit set (α- limit set ) for γ and denoted lim ω γ (lim α γ).  If the ω-limit set (α-limit set) is disjoint from the orbit γ, that is lim ω γ ∩ γ = ∅ (lim α γ ∩ γ = ∅), we call lim ω γ (lim α γ) a ω-limit cycle ( α-limit cycle ).  Alternatively the limit sets can be defined as        lim  ω   γ   :=    ⋂   s  ∈  ℝ      {   φ   (  x  ,  t  )    :   t  >  s   }   ¯       assign    subscript   ω   γ     subscript     s  ℝ     normal-¯   conditional-set    φ   x  t      t  s        \lim_{\omega}\gamma:=\bigcap_{s\in\mathbb{R}}\overline{\{\varphi(x,t):t>s\}}   and      x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   of a dynamical system, lim ω     x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   = lim α     x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   = $x_0$  Properties   lim ω γ and lim α γ are closed  if X is compact then lim ω γ and lim α γ are nonempty , compact and connected  lim ω γ and lim α γ are φ-invariant, that is φ( R × lim ω γ) = lim ω γ and φ( R × lim α γ) = lim α γ   See also   Julia set  Stable set  Limit cycle  Periodic point  Non-wandering set  Kleinian group   References     "
