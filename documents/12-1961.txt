Bogoliubov inner product

The Bogoliubov inner product (Duhamel two-point function, Bogolyubov inner product, Bogoliubov scalar product, Kubo-Mori-Bogoliubov inner product) is a special inner product in the space of operators. The Bogoliubov inner product appears in quantum statistical mechanics12 and is named after theoretical physicist Nikolay Bogoliubov.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a self-adjoint operator. The Bogoliubov inner product of any two operators X and Y is defined as



The Bogoliubov inner product satisfies all the axioms of the inner product: it is sesquilinear, positive semidefinite (i.e., 
 
 
 
 ), and satisfies the symmetry property 
 
 
 
 .
In applications to quantum statistical mechanics, the operator 
 
 
 
  has the form 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the Hamiltonian of the quantum system and 
 
 
 
  is the inverse temperature. With these notations, the Bogoliubov inner product takes the form


 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes the thermal average with respect to the Hamiltonian 
 
 
 
  and inverse temperature 
 
 
 
 .
In quantum statistical mechanics, the Bogoliubov inner product appears as the second order term in the expansion of the statistical sum:
