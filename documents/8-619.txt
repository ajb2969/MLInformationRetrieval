   Area-to-area Lee model      Area-to-area Lee model   The Lee model for area-to-area mode is a radio propagation model that operates around 900 MHz. Built as two different modes, this model includes an adjustment factor that can be adjusted to make the model more flexible to different regions of propagation.  Applicable to/under conditions  This model is suitable for using in data collected . The model predicts the behaviour of all links that has ends in specific areas.  Coverage  Frequency : 900 MHz band  Mathematical formulation  The model  The Lee model is formally expressed as:       L   =      L  0    +   γ   log   d      -   10   log   F  A          L       subscript  L  0     γ    d       10     subscript  F  A        L\;=\;L_{0}\;+\;\gamma\log d\;-10\log{F_{A}}     where,   L = The median  path loss . Unit: decibel (dB)  L 0 = The reference path loss along 1 km. Unit: decibel] (dB)      γ    γ   \gamma\;   = The slope of the path loss curve. Unit: decibels per decade  d = The distance on which the path loss is to be calculated.  F A = Adjustment factor.   Calculation of reference path loss  The reference path loss is usually computed along a 1 km or 1 mile link. Any other suitable length of path can be chosen based on the applications.
