Cramér–Wold theorem

In mathematics, the Cramér–Wold theorem in measure theory states that a Borel probability measure on 
 
 
 
  is uniquely determined by the totality of its one-dimensional projections. It is used as a method for proving joint convergence results. The theorem is named after Harald Cramér and Herman Ole Andreas Wold.
Let



and



be random vectors of dimension k. Then 
 
 
converges in distribution to 
 
 
 
  if and only if:



for each 
 
 
 
 , that is, if every fixed linear combination of the coordinates of 
 
 
 
  converges in distribution to the correspondent linear combination of coordinates of 
 
 
 
 .
