   Cramér–Wold theorem      Cramér–Wold theorem   In mathematics , the Cramér–Wold theorem in measure theory states that a Borel  probability measure on    R  k     superscript  R  k    R^{k}   is uniquely determined by the totality of its one-dimensional projections. It is used as a method for proving joint convergence results. The theorem is named after Harald Cramér and Herman Ole Andreas Wold .  Let        X  ¯   n   =   (   X   n  1    ,  …  ,   X   n  k    )        subscript   normal-¯  X   n     subscript  X    n  1    normal-…   subscript  X    n  k       \overline{X}_{n}=(X_{n1},\dots,X_{nk})\;     and        X  ¯    =   (   X  1   ,  …  ,   X  k   )        normal-¯  X     subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  k      \;\overline{X}=(X_{1},\dots,X_{k})     be random vectors of dimension k . Then     X  ¯   n     subscript   normal-¯  X   n    \overline{X}_{n}    converges in distribution to    X  ¯     normal-¯  X    \overline{X}   if and only if:        ∑   i  =  1   k     t  i    X   n  i      →   n  →  ∞    𝐷     ∑   i  =  1   k     t  i    X  i       .      superscript   subscript     i  1    k      subscript  t  i    subscript  X    n  i     D    normal-→  n    normal-→      superscript   subscript     i  1    k      subscript  t  i    subscript  X  i        \sum_{i=1}^{k}t_{i}X_{ni}\overset{D}{\underset{n\rightarrow\infty}{\rightarrow%
 }}\sum_{i=1}^{k}t_{i}X_{i}.     for each     (   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  k   )   ∈   ℝ  k         subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  k     superscript  ℝ  k     (t_{1},\dots,t_{k})\in\mathbb{R}^{k}   , that is, if every fixed linear combination of the coordinates of     X  ¯   n     subscript   normal-¯  X   n    \overline{X}_{n}   converges in distribution to the correspondent linear combination of coordinates of    X  ¯     normal-¯  X    \overline{X}   .
