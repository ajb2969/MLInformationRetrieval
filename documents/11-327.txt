   Channel-conductance-controlling ATPase      Channel-conductance-controlling ATPase   In enzymology , a channel-conductance-controlling ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and H 2 O , whereas its two products are ADP and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (channel-conductance-controlling) .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
