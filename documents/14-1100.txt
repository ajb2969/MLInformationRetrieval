   Random structure function      Random structure function   The random structure function 1 is the third component of the Bernoulli space which constitutes the stochastic model within Bernoulli stochastics . 2 The Bernoulli space describes the transition from past to future. The determinate past is represented by a variable D which is called deterministic variable, because its value is fixed. The future represented by the variable X is subject to randomness and X is therefore called random variable. The random variable X may adopt one of a set of different values according to a random law which depends on the actual initial conditions given by the value d of the deterministic variable. The random law does not only fix the range of variability of X but also the probability of the future events which are given by subsets of the range of variability of X .  Probability distribution  The random variable X stands for the future indeterminate outcome of a process. If the process is repeated then different outcomes will occur according to a random law that depends on the actual initial conditions given by the value d of the deterministic variable D . The random variable X under the condition d is denoted    X  |   {  d  }      fragments  X  normal-|   fragments  normal-{  d  normal-}     X|\{d\}   where the set of possible initial conditions is given by the ignorance space    𝔇   𝔇   \mathfrak{D}   . The random structure function assigns to each subset of the ignorance space a probability distribution.  Let    𝔇  0     subscript  𝔇  0    \mathfrak{D}_{0}   be a subset of the ignorance space   𝔇   𝔇   \mathfrak{D}   then the corresponding probability distribution is obtained from the images    𝔓   (   {  d  }   )       𝔓   d     \mathfrak{P}(\{d\})   of the singletons    {  d  }     d    \{d\}   as follows:        𝔓   (   𝔇  0   )   )  =   1   |   𝔇  0   |    ∑     d  ∈   𝔇  0     𝔓  (   {  d  }   )     fragments  P   fragments  normal-(   subscript  𝔇  0   normal-)   normal-)     1     subscript  𝔇  0         d   subscript  𝔇  0     P  normal-(   fragments  normal-{  d  normal-}   normal-)    \mathfrak{P}(\mathfrak{D}_{0}))=\frac{1}{|\mathfrak{D}_{0}|}\sum_{d\in%
 \mathfrak{D}_{0}}\mathfrak{P}(\{d\})        It follows that for any future event E , we have:          P   X  |   𝔇  0      (  E  )    =    1   |   𝔇  0   |      ∑   d  ∈   𝔇  0       P   X  |   {  d  }      (  E  )             subscript  P   fragments  X  normal-|   subscript  𝔇  0     E       1     subscript  𝔇  0       subscript     d   subscript  𝔇  0        subscript  P   fragments  X  normal-|   fragments  normal-{  d  normal-}     E       P_{X|\mathfrak{D}_{0}}(E)=\frac{1}{|\mathfrak{D}_{0}|}\sum_{d\in\mathfrak{D}_{%
 0}}P_{X|\{d\}}(E)        Thus, the probability distribution of the random variable    X  |   𝔇  0      fragments  X  normal-|   subscript  𝔇  0     X|\mathfrak{D}_{0}   is given by the mean of the probability distributions of the random variables    X  |   {   d  0   }      fragments  X  normal-|   fragments  normal-{   subscript  d  0   normal-}     X|\{d_{0}\}   .
