   Chlorophenol O-methyltransferase      Chlorophenol O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a chlorophenol O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + trichlorophenol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + trichloroanisole   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and trichlorophenol , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and trichloroanisole .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:trichlorophenol O-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include halogenated phenol O-methyltransferase, trichlorophenol , and O-methyltransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
