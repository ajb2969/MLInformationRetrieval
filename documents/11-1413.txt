   (3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring))      (3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring))   In enzymology , a [3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring)] () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + [3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring)]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + [3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring)] phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring) , whereas its 3 products are ADP , 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring) , and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring a phosphate group to the sidechain oxygen atom of serine or threonine residues in proteins ( protein-serine/threonine kinases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:[3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring)] phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include kinase , BCK , BCKD kinase , BCODH kinase , branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase , branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase kinase , branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase kinase , branched-chain oxo acid dehydrogenase kinase (phosphorylating) , and STK2 .  In 2012, it was suggested that mutations in the gene which expresses this enzyme could be the cause of a rare form of autism. 1  References        "  Category:EC 2.7.11  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure     ↩
