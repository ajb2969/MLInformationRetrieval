   Volterra operator      Volterra operator   In mathematics , in the area of functional analysis and operator theory , the Volterra operator , named after Vito Volterra , represents the operation of indefinite integration , viewed as a bounded linear operator on the space L 2 (0,1) of complex-valued square integrable functions on the interval (0,1). It is the operator corresponding to the Volterra integral equations .  Definition  The Volterra operator, V , may be defined for a function f ∈ L 2 (0,1) and a value t ∈ (0,1), as        V   (  f  )    (  t  )    =    ∫  0  t    f   (  s  )   d  s     .        V  f  t     superscript   subscript   0   t     f  s  d  s      V(f)(t)=\int_{0}^{t}f(s)\,ds.     Properties   V is a bounded linear operator between Hilbert spaces , with Hermitian adjoint            V  *    (  f  )    (  t  )    =    ∫  t  1    f   (  s  )   d  s     .         superscript  V    f  t     superscript   subscript   t   1     f  s  d  s      V^{*}(f)(t)=\int_{t}^{1}f(s)\,ds.         V is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator , hence in particular is compact . 1  V has no eigenvalues and therefore, by the spectral theory of compact operators , its spectrum σ( V ) = {0}. 2  V is a quasinilpotent operator (that is, the spectral radius , ρ ( V ), is zero), but it is not nilpotent .  The operator norm of V is exactly || V || = 2 ⁄ π . 3   References  "  Category:Operator theory     ↩
