   Poretsky's law of forms      Poretsky's law of forms   In Boolean algebra , Poretsky's law of forms shows that the single Boolean equation     f   (  X  )    =  0        f  X   0    f(X)=0   is equivalent to     g   (  X  )    =   h   (  X  )          g  X     h  X     g(X)=h(X)   if and only if    g  =   f  ⊕  h       g   direct-sum  f  h     g=f\oplus h   , where   ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus   represents exclusive or .  The law of forms was discovered by Platon Poretsky .  References   Frank Markham Brown, Boolean Reasoning: The Logic of Boolean Equations , 2nd edition, 2003, p. 100   "  Category:Boolean algebra
