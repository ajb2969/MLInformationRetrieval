   Dephasing rate SP formula      Dephasing rate SP formula   The SP formula for the dephasing rate    Γ  φ     subscript  normal-Γ  φ    \Gamma_{\varphi}   of a particle that moves in a fluctuating environment unifies various results that have been obtained, notably in condensed matter physics , with regard to the motion of electrons in a metal 1  2  3 . 4 The general case requires to take into account not only the temporal correlations but also the spatial correlations of the environmental fluctuations . 5 These can be characterized by the spectral form factor     S  ~    (  q  ,  ω  )        normal-~  S    q  ω     \tilde{S}(q,\omega)   , while the motion of the particle is characterized by its power spectrum     P  ~    (  q  ,  ω  )        normal-~  P    q  ω     \tilde{P}(q,\omega)   . Consequently at finite temperature the expression for the dephasing rate takes the following form that involves "S" and "P" functions: 6  7  8       Γ  φ    =   ∫   d  q   ∫      d  ω    2  π      S  ~    (  q  ,  ω  )    P  ~    (   -  q   ,   -  ω   )            subscript  normal-Γ  φ       d  q          d  ω     2  π     normal-~  S    q  ω    normal-~  P      q     ω          \Gamma_{\varphi}\ =\ \int d{q}\int\frac{d\omega}{2\pi}\,\tilde{S}({q},\omega)%
 \,\tilde{P}(-{q},-\omega)     Due to inherent limitations of the semiclassical (stationary phase) approximation the physically correct procedure is to use the non-symmetrized quantum versions of     S  ~    (  q  ,  ω  )        normal-~  S    q  ω     \tilde{S}(q,\omega)   and     P  ~    (  q  ,  ω  )        normal-~  P    q  ω     \tilde{P}(q,\omega)   . The argument is based on the analogy of the above expression with Fermi-golden-rule calculation of the transitions which are induced by the system-environment interaction.  Derivation  It is most illuminating to understand the SP formula in the context of the DLD model , which describes motion in dynamical disorder. In order to derive the dephasing rate formula from first principles, a purity-based definition of the dephasing factor can be adopted. 9 The purity     P   (  t  )    =   e   -   F   (  t  )            P  t    superscript  e      F  t       P(t)=e^{-F(t)}   describes how a quantum state becomes mixed due to the entanglement of the system with the environment. Using perturbation theory, one recovers at finite temperatures at the long time limit     F   (  t  )    =    Γ  φ   t         F  t      subscript  normal-Γ  φ   t     F(t)=\Gamma_{\varphi}t   where the decay constant is given by the dephasing rate formula with non symmetrized spectral functions as expected. There is a somewhat controversial possibility to get power law decay of    P   (  t  )       P  t    P(t)   at the limit of zero temperature. 10 The proper way to incorporate Pauli blocking in the many-body dephasing calculation, 11 within the framework of the SP formula approach, has been clarified as well. 12  Example  For the standard 1D Caldeira-Leggett Ohmic environment, with temperature   T   T   T   and friction   η   η   \eta   , the spectral form factor is        S  ~    (  q  ,  ω  )    =       (   2  π   )   δ   (  q  )     q  2      [    2  η  ω    1  -   e   -   ω  /  T       ]           normal-~  S    q  ω            2  π   δ  q    superscript  q  2     delimited-[]      2  η  ω     1   superscript  e      ω  T           \tilde{S}(q,\omega)\ =\ \frac{(2\pi)\delta(q)}{q^{2}}\,\left[\frac{2\eta\omega%
 }{1-e^{-\omega/T}}\right]     This expression reflects that in the classical limit the electron experiences "white temporal noise", which means force that is not correlated in time, but uniform is space (high   q   q   q   components are absent). In contrast to that, for diffusive motion of an electron in a 3D metallic environment, which is created by the rest of the electrons, the spectral form factor is         S  ~    (  q  ,  ω  )    =    1   ν  D   q  2      [    2  ω    1  -   e   -   ω  /  T       ]     .         normal-~  S    q  ω        1    ν  D   superscript  q  2      delimited-[]      2  ω     1   superscript  e      ω  T           \tilde{S}(q,\omega)\ =\ \frac{1}{\nu Dq^{2}}\left[\frac{2\omega}{1-e^{-\omega/%
 T}}\right].     This expression reflects that in the classical limit the electron experiences "white spatio-temporal noise", which means force that is neither correlated in time nor in space. The power spectrum of a single diffusive electron is        P  ~    (  q  ,  ω  )    =    2  D   q  2      ω  2   +    (   D   q  2    )   2           normal-~  P    q  ω         2  D   superscript  q  2       superscript  ω  2    superscript    D   superscript  q  2    2       \tilde{P}(q,\omega)\ \ =\ \ \frac{2Dq^{2}}{\omega^{2}+(Dq^{2})^{2}}     But in the many body context this expression acquires a "Fermi blocking factor":        P  ~    (  q  ,  ω  )    =     d   d  ω     [   ω   1  -   e   -   ω  /  T       ]    ×    2  D   q  2      ω  2   +    (   D   q  2    )   2            normal-~  P    q  ω           d    d  ω     delimited-[]    ω    1   superscript  e      ω  T             2  D   superscript  q  2       superscript  ω  2    superscript    D   superscript  q  2    2        \tilde{P}(q,\omega)\ \ =\ \ \frac{d}{d\omega}\left[\frac{\omega}{1-e^{-\omega/%
 T}}\right]\times\frac{2Dq^{2}}{\omega^{2}+(Dq^{2})^{2}}     Calculating the SP integral we get the well known result     Γ  φ   ∝   T   3  /  2       proportional-to   subscript  normal-Γ  φ    superscript  T    3  2      \Gamma_{\varphi}\propto T^{3/2}   .
