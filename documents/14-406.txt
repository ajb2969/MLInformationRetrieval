Unital map

In abstract algebra, a unital map on a C*-algebra is a map 
 
 
 
  which preserves the identity element:



This condition appears often in the context of completely positive maps, especially when they represent quantum operations.
If 
 
 
 
  is completely positive, it can always be represented as



(The 
 
 
 
  are the Kraus operators associated with 
 
 
 
 ). In this case, the unital condition can be expressed as
