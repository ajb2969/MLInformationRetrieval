   Unital map      Unital map   In abstract algebra , a unital map on a C*-algebra is a map   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   which preserves the identity element:        ϕ   (  I  )    =  I   .        ϕ  I   I    \phi(I)=I.\,     This condition appears often in the context of completely positive maps , especially when they represent quantum operations .  If   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is completely positive, it can always be represented as        ϕ   (  ρ  )    =    ∑  i     E  i   ρ   E  i  †      .        ϕ  ρ     subscript   i      subscript  E  i   ρ   superscript   subscript  E  i   normal-†       \phi(\rho)=\sum_{i}E_{i}\rho E_{i}^{\dagger}.\,     (The    E  i     subscript  E  i    E_{i}   are the Kraus operators associated with   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   ). In this case, the unital condition can be expressed as         ∑  i     E  i    E  i  †     =  I   .        subscript   i      subscript  E  i    superscript   subscript  E  i   normal-†     I    \sum_{i}E_{i}E_{i}^{\dagger}=I.\,     "  Category:C*-algebras
