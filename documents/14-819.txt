   Persistent homology      Persistent homology   See homology for an introduction to the notation.  Persistent homology is a method for computing topological features of a space at different spatial resolutions. More persistent features are detected over a wide range of length and are deemed more likely to represent true features of the underlying space, rather than artifacts of sampling, noise, or particular choice of parameters. 1  To find the persistent homology of a space, the space must first be represented as a simplicial complex . A distance function on the underlying space corresponds to a filtration of the simplicial complex, that is a nested sequence of increasing subsets.  Formally, consider a real-valued function on a simplicial complex    f  :   K  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  K  ℝ     f:K\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   that is non-decreasing on increasing sequences of faces, so     f   (  σ  )    ≤   f   (  τ  )          f  σ     f  τ     f(\sigma)\leq f(\tau)   whenever   σ   σ   \sigma   is a face of   τ   τ   \tau   in   K   K   K   . Then for every    a  ∈  ℝ      a  ℝ    a\in\mathbb{R}   the sublevel set      K   (  a  )    =    f   -  1     (   -  ∞   ,  a  ]          K  a      superscript  f    1         a      K(a)=f^{-1}(-\infty,a]   is a subcomplex of K, and the ordering of the values of   f   f   f   on the simplices in   K   K   K   (which is in practice always finite) induces an ordering on the sublevel complexes that defines the filtration      ∅  =   K  0   ⊆   K  1   ⊆  …  ⊆   K  n   =  K          subscript  K  0         subscript  K  1        normal-…        subscript  K  n        K     \emptyset=K_{0}\subseteq K_{1}\subseteq\ldots\subseteq K_{n}=K   When    0  ≤  i  ≤  j  ≤  n        0  i       j       n     0\leq i\leq j\leq n   , the inclusion     K  i   ↪   K  j      normal-↪   subscript  K  i    subscript  K  j     K_{i}\hookrightarrow K_{j}   induces a homomorphism      f  p   i  ,  j    :     H  p    (   K  i   )    →    H  p    (   K  j   )        normal-:   superscript   subscript  f  p    i  j     normal-→     subscript  H  p    subscript  K  i       subscript  H  p    subscript  K  j       f_{p}^{i,j}:H_{p}(K_{i})\rightarrow H_{p}(K_{j})   on the simplicial homology groups for each dimension   p   p   p   . The    p   t  h      superscript  p    t  h     p^{th}    persistent homology groups are the images of these homomorphisms, and the    p   t  h      superscript  p    t  h     p^{th}    persistent Betti numbers     β  p   i  ,  j      superscript   subscript  β  p    i  j     \beta_{p}^{i,j}   are the ranks of those groups. 2 Persistent Betti numbers for    p  =  0      p  0    p=0   coincide with the predecessor of persistence homology, i.e. the size function . 3  There are various software packages for computing persistence intervals of a finite filtration, such as javaPlex , Dionysus , Perseus , PHAT , Gudhi , and the phom and TDA  R packages.
