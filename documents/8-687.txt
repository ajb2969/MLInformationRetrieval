   Welch–Satterthwaite equation      Welch–Satterthwaite equation   In statistics and uncertainty analysis , the Welch–Satterthwaite equation is used to calculate an approximation to the effective degrees of freedom of a linear combination of independent sample variances , also known as the pooled degrees of freedom , 1 2 corresponding to the pooled variance .  For   n   n   n   sample variances 1, ..., n )}} , each respectively having degrees of freedom, often one computes the linear combination        χ  ′   =    ∑   i  =  1   n     k  i    s  i  2      .       superscript  χ  normal-′     superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  k  i    superscript   subscript  s  i   2       \chi^{\prime}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}k_{i}s_{i}^{2}.     where    k  i     subscript  k  i    k_{i}   is a real positive number, typically     1   n  i    =   1    v  i   +  1          1   subscript  n  i      1     subscript  v  i   1      \frac{1}{n_{i}}=\frac{1}{v_{i}+1}   . In general, the probability distribution of     ν   χ  ′    ≈     (     ∑   i  =  1   n      k  i    s  i  2     )   2      ∑   i  =  1   n        (    k  i    s  i  2    )   2    ν  i            subscript  ν   superscript  χ  normal-′       superscript    superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  k  i    superscript   subscript  s  i   2     2     superscript   subscript     i  1    n      superscript     subscript  k  i    superscript   subscript  s  i   2    2    subscript  ν  i        \nu_{\chi^{\prime}}\approx\frac{\displaystyle\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}k_{i}s_{i}^{2%
 }\right)^{2}}{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(k_{i}s_{i}^{2})^{2}}{\nu_{i}}}   cannot be expressed analytically. However, its distribution can be approximated by another chi-squared distribution , whose effective degrees of freedom are given by the Welch–Satterthwaite equation  $$\nu_{\chi'} \approx \frac{\displaystyle\left(\sum_{i=1}^n k_i s_i^2\right)^2}
                           {\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(k_i s_i^2)^2}
                                                {\nu_i}
                           }$$  There is no assumption that the underlying population variances are equal. This is known as the Behrens–Fisher problem .  The result can be used to perform approximate statistical inference tests. The simplest application of this equation is in performing Welch's t test .
