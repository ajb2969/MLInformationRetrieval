   Hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase      Hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase   In enzymology , a hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-3-hydroxybutanoate + 2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetoacetate + (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-3-hydroxybutanoate and 2-oxoglutarate , whereas its two products are acetoacetate and (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-3-hydroxybutanoate:2-oxoglutarate oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called transhydrogenase, hydroxy acid-oxo acid .
