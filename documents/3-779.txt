   Solenoidal vector field      Solenoidal vector field   In vector calculus a solenoidal vector field (also known as an incompressible vector field or a divergence free vector field ) is a vector field  v with divergence zero at all points in the field:       ∇  ⋅  𝐯   =   0.        normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐯   0.    \nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}=0.\,     Properties  The fundamental theorem of vector calculus states that any vector field can be expressed as the sum of an irrotational and a solenoidal field. The condition of zero divergence is satisfied whenever a vector field v has only a vector potential component, because the definition of the vector potential A as:      𝐯  =   ∇  ×  𝐀       𝐯    normal-∇  𝐀     \mathbf{v}=\nabla\times\mathbf{A}     automatically results in the identity (as can be shown, for example, using Cartesian coordinates):       ∇  ⋅  𝐯   =   ∇  ⋅   (   ∇  ×  𝐀   )    =  0.         normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐯    normal-⋅  normal-∇    normal-∇  𝐀         0.     \nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}=\nabla\cdot(\nabla\times\mathbf{A})=0.     The converse also holds: for any solenoidal v there exists a vector potential A such that     𝐯  =   ∇  ×  𝐀    .      𝐯    normal-∇  𝐀     \mathbf{v}=\nabla\times\mathbf{A}.   (Strictly speaking, this holds only subject to certain technical conditions on v , see Helmholtz decomposition .)  The divergence theorem gives the equivalent integral definition of a solenoidal field; namely that for any closed surface, the net total flux through the surface must be zero:      where    d  𝐒      d  𝐒    d\mathbf{S}   is the outward normal to each surface element.  Etymology  Solenoidal has its origin in the Greek word for solenoid , which is σωληνοειδές (sōlēnoeidēs) meaning pipe-shaped, from σωλην (sōlēn) or pipe. In the present context of solenoidal it means constrained as if in a pipe, so with a fixed volume.  Examples   the magnetic field  B is solenoidal (see Maxwell's equations );  the velocity field of an incompressible fluid flow is solenoidal;  the vorticity field is solenoidal  the electric field  E in neutral regions (     ρ  e   =  0       subscript  ρ  e   0    \rho_{e}=0   );  the current density  J where the charge density is unvarying,      ∂   ρ  e     ∂  t    =  0           subscript  ρ  e      t    0    \frac{\partial\rho_{e}}{\partial t}=0   .
