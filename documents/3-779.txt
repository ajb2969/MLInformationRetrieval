Solenoidal vector field

In vector calculus a solenoidal vector field (also known as an incompressible vector field or a divergence free vector field ) is a vector field v with divergence zero at all points in the field:



Properties
The fundamental theorem of vector calculus states that any vector field can be expressed as the sum of an irrotational and a solenoidal field. The condition of zero divergence is satisfied whenever a vector field v has only a vector potential component, because the definition of the vector potential A as:



automatically results in the identity (as can be shown, for example, using Cartesian coordinates):



The converse also holds: for any solenoidal v there exists a vector potential A such that 
 
 
 
  (Strictly speaking, this holds only subject to certain technical conditions on v, see Helmholtz decomposition.)
The divergence theorem gives the equivalent integral definition of a solenoidal field; namely that for any closed surface, the net total flux through the surface must be zero:




where 
 
 
 
  is the outward normal to each surface element.
Etymology
Solenoidal has its origin in the Greek word for solenoid, which is σωληνοειδές (sōlēnoeidēs) meaning pipe-shaped, from σωλην (sōlēn) or pipe. In the present context of solenoidal it means constrained as if in a pipe, so with a fixed volume.
Examples

the magnetic field B is solenoidal (see Maxwell's equations);
the velocity field of an incompressible fluid flow is solenoidal;
the vorticity field is solenoidal
the electric field E in neutral regions (
 
 
 
 );
the current density J where the charge density is unvarying,
