Formyl-CoA hydrolase




Formyl-CoA hydrolase

In enzymology, a formyl-CoA hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

formyl-CoA + H2O 
 
 
 
  CoA + formate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are formyl-CoA and H2O, whereas its two products are CoA and formate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is formyl-CoA hydrolase. This enzyme is also called formyl coenzyme A hydrolase. This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism.
