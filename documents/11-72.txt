   Dicarboxylate—CoA ligase      Dicarboxylate—CoA ligase   In enzymology , a dicarboxylate-CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + an alphaomega-dicarboxylic acid + CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + an omega-carboxyacyl-CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , alphaomega-dicarboxylic acid , and CoA , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and omega-carboxyacyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is omega-dicarboxylate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include carboxylyl-CoA synthetase , and dicarboxylyl-CoA synthetase .
