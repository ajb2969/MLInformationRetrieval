   Shunt impedance      Shunt impedance   In accelerator physics , shunt impedance is a measure of the strength with which an eigenmode of a resonant radio frequency structure (e.g., in a microwave cavity ) interacts with charged particles on a given straight line, typically along the axis of rotational symmetry. If not specified further, the term is likely to refer to longitudinal effective shunt impedance .  Longitudinal shunt impedance  To produce longitudinal Coulomb forces which add up to the (longitudinal) acceleration voltage     V  ∥     subscript  V  parallel-to    \scriptstyle V_{\parallel}   , an eigenmode of the resonator has to be excited, leading to power dissipation   P   P   \scriptstyle P   . The definition of the longitudinal effective shunt impedance ,   R   R   \scriptstyle R   , then reads: 1      R  =     |   V  ∥   |   2   P       R     superscript     subscript  V  parallel-to    2   P     R=\frac{|V_{\parallel}|^{2}}{P}     with the longitudinal effective acceleration voltage     |   V  ∥   |       subscript  V  parallel-to     \scriptstyle|V_{\parallel}|   .  The time-independent shunt impedance ,    R  0     subscript  R  0    \scriptstyle R_{0}   , with the time-independent acceleration voltage     V  0     subscript  V  0    \scriptstyle V_{0}   is defined: 2        R  0   =    V  0  2   P    .       subscript  R  0      superscript   subscript  V  0   2   P     R_{0}=\frac{V_{0}^{2}}{P}.     One can use the quality factor    Q   Q   \scriptstyle Q   to substitute   P   P   \scriptstyle P   with an equivalent expression:       R  =   Q     |   V  ∥   |   2    ω  W      ,      R    Q     superscript     subscript  V  parallel-to    2     ω  W       R=Q\frac{|V_{\parallel}|^{2}}{\omega W},     where W is the maximum energy stored. Since the quality factor is the only quantity in the right equation term that depends on wall properties, the quantity     R  Q       R  Q    \scriptstyle\frac{R}{Q}   is often used to design cavities , omitting material properties at first (see also cavity geometry factor ).  Transverse shunt impedance  When a particle is deflected in transverse direction, the definition of the shunt impedance can be used with substitution of the (longitudinal) acceleration voltage by the transverse effective acceleration voltage , taking into account transversal Coulomb and  Lorentz forces .       R  ⟂   =     |   V  ⟂   |   2    P  0    =   Q     |   V  ⟂   |   2    ω  W            subscript  R  perpendicular-to      superscript     subscript  V  perpendicular-to    2    subscript  P  0           Q     superscript     subscript  V  perpendicular-to    2     ω  W        R_{\perp}=\frac{|V_{\perp}|^{2}}{P_{0}}=Q\frac{|V_{\perp}|^{2}}{\omega W}     This does not necessarily imply a change in particle energy since a particle can also be deflected by magnetic fields (see Panofsky-Wenzel theorem ).  Polarization angle  Because the transverse deflection can be described with polar coordinates, one may define a deflection or polarization angle using the transverse acceleration voltage components. Polar coordinates are used because it is possible to add up voltage components like vectors, but not shunt impedances.  References  "  Category:Accelerator physics
