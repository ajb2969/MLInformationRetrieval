   Fermi's golden rule      Fermi's golden rule   In quantum physics , Fermi's golden rule is a simple formula for the constant transition rate (probability of transition per unit time) from one energy eigenstate of a quantum system into other energy eigenstates in a continuum, effected by a perturbation .  Although named after Fermi , most of the work leading to the Golden Rule is due to Dirac 1 who formulated a virtually identical equation, including the three components of a constant, the matrix element of the perturbation and an energy difference. It was given this name because, on account of its importance, Fermi dubbed it "Golden Rule No. 2." 2  Consider the system to begin in an eigenstate ,    |  i  ⟩     ket  i    |i\rangle   , of a given Hamiltonian ,   H   H   H    0 . Consider the effect of a (possibly time-dependent) perturbing Hamiltonian,   H   H   H   . If   H   H   H   is time-independent, the system goes only into those states in the continuum that have the same energy as the initial state. If   H   H   H   is oscillating as a function of time with an angular frequency    ω   ω   ω   , the transition is into states with energies that differ by    ħ  ω      ħ  ω    ħω   from the energy of the initial state.  In both cases, the one-to-many transition probability per unit of time from the state    |  i  ⟩     ket  i    |i\rangle   to a set of final states    |  f  ⟩     ket  f    |f\rangle   is essentially constant. It is given, to first order in the perturbation, by         Γ   i  →  f    =     2  π   ℏ     |   ⟨  f  |   H  ′   |  i  ⟩   |   2   ρ        subscript  normal-Γ   normal-→  i  f          2  π   Planck-constant-over-2-pi    superscript     quantum-operator-product  f   superscript  H  normal-′   i    2   ρ     \Gamma_{i\rightarrow f}=\frac{2\pi}{\hbar}\left|\langle f|H^{\prime}|i\rangle%
 \right|^{2}\rho        where   ρ   ρ   ρ   is the density of final states (number of continuum states per unit of energy) and    ⟨  f  |   H  ′   |  i  ⟩     quantum-operator-product  f   superscript  H  normal-′   i    \langle f|H^{\prime}|i\rangle   is the matrix element (in bra–ket notation ) of the perturbation   H   H   H   between the final and initial states.  This transition probability is also called "decay probability" and is related to the inverse of the mean lifetime . Fermi's golden rule is valid when the initial state has not been significantly depleted by scattering into the final states.  The standard way to derive the equation is to start with time-dependent perturbation theory and to take the limit for absorption under the assumption that the time of the measurement is much larger than the time needed for the transition. 3 4 The golden rule is a straightforward consequence of the Schrödinger equation , solved to lowest order in the perturbation   H   H   H   of the Hamiltonian,         (     H  0   +   H  ′    -   i  ℏ   ∂   ∂  t      )     ∑  n     a  n    (  t  )    ψ  n    e   -    i  t   E  n    /  ℏ        =   0    ,             subscript  H  0    superscript  H  normal-′      i  Planck-constant-over-2-pi       t        subscript   n      subscript  a  n   t   subscript  ψ  n    superscript  e        i  t   subscript  E  n    Planck-constant-over-2-pi        0    \left(H_{0}+H^{\prime}-i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right)\sum_{n}a_{n}(t%

 \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}d\omega\frac{\sin\omega t}{\omega}   is now merely proportional to a constant Dirichlet integral ,   π   π   π   .  The time dependence has vanished , and the constant decay rate of the golden rule follows. As a constant, it underlies the exponential particle decay laws of radioactivity. (For excessively long times, however, the secular growth of the s invalidates lowest-order perturbation theory, which requires .)  Only the magnitude of the matrix element    ⟨  f  |   H  ′   |  i  ⟩     quantum-operator-product  f   superscript  H  normal-′   i    \langle f|H^{\prime}|i\rangle   enters the Fermi's Golden Rule. The phase of this matrix element, however, contains separate information about the transition process. It appears in expressions that complement the Golden Rule in the semiclassical Boltzmann equation approach to electron transport. 5  References  External links   More information on Fermi's golden rule  ISBN 9783527409150   See also   Particle decay  Exponential decay  Sinc function  Time-dependent perturbation theory   "  Category:Concepts in physics  Category:Perturbation theory  Category:Mathematical physics     See equations (24) and (32). ↩  , formula VIII.2 ↩  R Schwitters' UT Notes on Derivation ↩  It is remarkable in that the rate is constant and not linearly increasing in time, as might be naively expected for transitions with strict conservation of energy enforced.
