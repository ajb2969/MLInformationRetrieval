   Coleman–Weinberg potential      Coleman–Weinberg potential   The Coleman–Weinberg model represents quantum electrodynamics of a scalar field in four-dimensions. The Lagrangian for the model is      L  =     -    1  4     (   F   μ  ν    )   2     +    (    D  μ   ϕ   )   2    -    m  2    ϕ  2    -    λ  6    ϕ  4         L            1  4    superscript   subscript  F    μ  ν    2      superscript     subscript  D  μ   ϕ   2       superscript  m  2    superscript  ϕ  2        λ  6    superscript  ϕ  4       L=-\frac{1}{4}(F_{\mu\nu})^{2}+(D_{\mu}\phi)^{2}-m^{2}\phi^{2}-\frac{\lambda}{%
 6}\phi^{4}     where the scalar field is complex,     F   μ  ν    =     ∂  μ    A  ν    -    ∂  ν    A  μ          subscript  F    μ  ν        subscript   μ    subscript  A  ν      subscript   ν    subscript  A  μ       F_{\mu\nu}=\partial_{\mu}A_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}A_{\mu}   is the electromagnetic field tensor, and     D  μ   =    ∂  μ   -    (    e  /  ℏ   c   )    A  μ          subscript  D  μ      subscript   μ         e  Planck-constant-over-2-pi   c    subscript  A  μ       D_{\mu}=\partial_{\mu}-(e/\hbar c)A_{\mu}   the covariant derivative containing the electric charge   e   e   e   of the electromagnetic field.  Assume that   λ   λ   \lambda   is nonnegative. Then if the mass term is tachyonic,     m  2   <  0       superscript  m  2   0    m^{2}<0   there is a spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry at low energies, a variant of the Higgs mechanism . On the other hand if the squared mass is positive,     m  2   >  0       superscript  m  2   0    m^{2}>0   the vacuum expectation of the field   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is zero. At the classical level the latter is true also if     m  2   =  0       superscript  m  2   0    m^{2}=0   However as was shown by Sidney Coleman and Erick Weinberg even if the renormalized mass is zero spontaneous symmetry breaking still happens due to the radiative corrections (this introduces a mass scale into a classically conformal theory - model have a conformal anomaly ).  The same can happen in other gauge theories. In the broken phase the fluctuations of the scalar field   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   will manifest themselves as a naturally light Higgs boson , as a matter of fact even too light to explain the electroweak symmetry breaking in the minimal model - much lighter than vector bosons . There are non-minimal models that give a more realistic scenarios. Also the variations of this mechanism were proposed for the hypothetical spontaneously broken symmetries including supersymmetry .  Equivalently one may say that the model possesses a first-order phase transition as a function of    m  2     superscript  m  2    m^{2}   . The model is the four-dimensional analog of the three-dimensional Ginzburg–Landau theory used to explain the properties of superconductors near the phase transition .  The three-dimensional version of the Coleman–Weinberg model governs the superconducting phase transition which can be both first- and second-order, depending on the ratio of the Ginzburg–Landau parameter     κ  ≡   λ  /   e  2        κ    λ   superscript  e  2      \kappa\equiv\lambda/e^{2}   , with a tricritical point near    κ  =   1  /   2        κ    1    2      \kappa=1/\sqrt{2}   which separates type I from type II  superconductivity . Historically, the order of the superconducting phase transition was debated for a long time since the temperature interval where fluctuations are large ( Ginzburg interval ) is extremely small. The question was finally settled in 1982. 1 If the Ginzburg-Landau parameter   κ   κ   \kappa   that distinguishes type-I and type-II superconductors (see also here ) is large enough, vortex fluctuations becomes important which drive the transition to second order. The tricitical point lies at roughly    κ  =   0.76  /   2        κ    0.76    2      \kappa=0.76/\sqrt{2}   , i.e., slightly below the value    κ  =   1  /   2        κ    1    2      \kappa=1/\sqrt{2}   where type-I goes over into type-II superconductor. The prediction was confirmed in 2002 by Monte Carlo computer simulations . 2  Literature        References    "  Category:Quantum field theory     ↩  ↩
