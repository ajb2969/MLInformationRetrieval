   Parshin's conjecture      Parshin's conjecture   In mathematics , more specifically in algebraic geometry , Parshin's conjecture (also referred to as the Beilinson–Parshin conjecture) states that for any smooth  projective variety  X defined over a finite field , the higher algebraic K-groups vanish up to torsion:         K  i    (  X  )    ⊗  𝐐   =    0   i   >  0.         tensor-product     subscript  K  i   X   𝐐     0  i        0.     K_{i}(X)\otimes\mathbf{Q}=0\ \,i>0.   It is named after Aleksei Nikolaevich Parshin and Alexander Beilinson .  Points and curves  The conjecture holds for a finite field by Quillen 's computations of the K -groups in this case. Secondly, for a smooth proper curve, Quillen 1 has shown that the K -groups are finitely generated, while Harder's computations 2 show that the groups are torsion. The two results together thus show Parshin's conjecture for curves.
