Parshin's conjecture

In mathematics, more specifically in algebraic geometry, Parshin's conjecture (also referred to as the Beilinson–Parshin conjecture) states that for any smooth projective variety X defined over a finite field, the higher algebraic K-groups vanish up to torsion:


 
  It is named after Aleksei Nikolaevich Parshin and Alexander Beilinson.
Points and curves
The conjecture holds for a finite field by Quillen's computations of the K-groups in this case. Secondly, for a smooth proper curve, Quillen1 has shown that the K-groups are finitely generated, while Harder's computations2 show that the groups are torsion. The two results together thus show Parshin's conjecture for curves.
