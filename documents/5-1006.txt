   Restriction (mathematics)      Restriction (mathematics)   (Figure)  The function x 2 with domain R does not have an inverse . If we restrict x 2 to the non-negative real numbers , then it does have an inverse, known as the square root of x .   In mathematics , the restriction of a function  f is a new function f | A obtained by choosing a smaller domain  A for the original function f . The notation    f   ↾  A        subscript  normal-↾  A   f  absent    f{\restriction_{A}}   is also used.  Formal definition  Let    f  :   E  →  F      normal-:  f    E  normal-→  F     f:E→F   be a function from a set   E   E   E   to a set   F   F   F   , so that the domain of   f   f   f   is in   E   E   E   (      dom   f   ⊆  E        dom  f   E    \mathrm{dom}\,f\subseteq E   ). If a set   A   A   A   is a subset of   E   E   E   , then the '''restriction of   f   f   f   to   A   A   A   ''' is the function 1        f  |   A   :   A  →  F      normal-:   evaluated-at  f  A    normal-→  A  F     {f|}_{A}\colon A\to F   .  Informally, the restriction of   f   f   f   to   A   A   A   is the same function as   f   f   f   , but is only defined on    A  ∩    dom   f       A    dom  f     A\cap\mathrm{dom}\,f   .  If the function   f   f   f   is thought of as a relation     (  x  ,   f   (  x  )    )     x    f  x     (x,f(x))   on the Cartesian product     E  ×  F      E  F    E\times F   , then the restriction of   f   f   f   to   A   A   A   can be represented by the graph      G   (    f  |   A   )    =   {    (  x  ,   f   (  x  )    )   ∈   G   (  f  )     ∣   x  ∈  A   }         G   evaluated-at  f  A     conditional-set     x    f  x      G  f      x  A      G({f|}_{A})=\{(x,f(x))\in G(f)\mid x\in A\}   , where the pairs    (  x  ,   f   (  x  )    )     x    f  x     (x,f(x))   represent edges in the graph   G   G   G   .  Examples   The restriction of the non- injective function     f  :    ℝ  →  ℝ   ;   x  ↦   x  2        normal-:  f   formulae-sequence   normal-→  ℝ  ℝ    maps-to  x   superscript  x  2       f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R};x\mapsto x^{2}   to     ℝ  +   =   [  0  ,  ∞  )        subscript  ℝ     0      \mathbb{R}_{+}=[0,\infty)   is the injection    f  :     ℝ  +   →  ℝ   ;   x  ↦   x  2        normal-:  f   formulae-sequence   normal-→   subscript  ℝ    ℝ    maps-to  x   superscript  x  2       f:\mathbb{R}_{+}\to\mathbb{R};x\mapsto x^{2}   .  The factorial function is the restriction of the gamma function to the integers.   Properties of restrictions   Restricting a function    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\rightarrow Y   to its entire domain   X   X   X   gives back the original function; i.e.,      f  |   X   =  f       evaluated-at  f  X   f    f|_{X}=f   .  Restricting a function twice is the same as restricting it once; i.e. if    A  ⊆  B  ⊆   dom  f         A  B         dom  f      A\subseteq B\subseteq\mathrm{dom}f   , then       (    f  |   B   )   |   A   =    f  |   A        evaluated-at   evaluated-at  f  B   A    evaluated-at  f  A     (f|_{B})|_{A}=f|_{A}   .  The restriction of the identity function on a space X to a subset A of X is just the inclusion map of A into X . 2  The restriction of a continuous function is continuous. 3 4   Applications  Inverse functions  For a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one . If a function   f   f   f   is not one-to-one, it may be possible to define a partial inverse of   f   f   f   by restricting the domain. For example, the function       f   (  x  )    =   x  2         f  x    superscript  x  2     f(x)=x^{2}     is not one-to-one, since . However, the function becomes one-to-one if we restrict to the domain    x  ≥  0      x  normal-≥  0    x≥0   , in which case         f   -  1     (  y  )    =   y    .         superscript  f    1    y     y     f^{-1}(y)=\sqrt{y}.     (If we instead restrict to the domain    x  ≤  0      x  normal-≤  0    x≤0   , then the inverse is the negative of the square root of   y   y   y   .) Alternatively, there is no need to restrict the domain if we are content with the inverse being a multivalued function :  Selection operators  In relational algebra , a selection (sometimes called a restriction to avoid confusion with SQL 's use of SELECT) is a unary operation written as     σ   a  θ  b     (  R  )        subscript  σ    a  θ  b    R    \sigma_{a\theta b}(R)   or     σ   a  θ  v     (  R  )        subscript  σ    a  θ  v    R    \sigma_{a\theta v}(R)   where:      a   a   a   and   b   b   b   are attribute names     θ   θ   \theta   is a binary operation in the set    {  <  ,  ≤  ,  =  ,  ≠  ,  ≥  ,  >  }             \{\;<,\leq,=,\neq,\geq,\;>\}        v   v   v   is a value constant     R   R   R   is a relation   The selection     σ   a  θ  b     (  R  )        subscript  σ    a  θ  b    R    \sigma_{a\theta b}(R)   selects all those tuples in   R   R   R   for which   θ   θ   \theta   holds between the   a   a   a   and the   b   b   b   attribute.  The selection     σ   a  θ  v     (  R  )        subscript  σ    a  θ  v    R    \sigma_{a\theta v}(R)   selects all those tuples in   R   R   R   for which   θ   θ   \theta   holds between the   a   a   a   attribute and the value   v   v   v   .  Thus, the selection operator restricts to a subset of the entire database.  The Pasting Lemma  The pasting lemma is a result in topology that relates the continuity of a function with the continuity of its restrictions to subsets.  Let    X  ,  Y     X  Y    X,Y   be both closed (or both open) subsets of a topological space A such that    A  =   X  ∪  Y       A    X  Y     A=X\cup Y   , and let B also be a topological space. If    f  :   A  →  B      normal-:  f   normal-→  A  B     f:A\to B   is continuous when restricted to both X and Y , then f is continuous.  This result allows one to take two continuous functions defined on closed (or open) subsets of a topological space and create a new one.  Sheaves  Sheaves provide a way of generalizing restrictions to objects besides functions.  In sheaf theory , one assigns an object    F   (  U  )       F  U    F(U)   in a category to each open set    U   U   U   of a topological space , and requires that the objects satisfy certain conditions. The most important condition is that there are restriction morphisms between every pair of objects associated to nested open sets; i.e., if    V  ⊆  U      V  U    V\subseteq U   , then there is a morphism res V , U : F ( U ) → F ( V ) satisfying the following properties, which are designed to mimic the restriction of a function:   For every open set U of X , the restriction morphism res U , U : F ( U ) → F ( U ) is the identity morphism on F ( U ).  If we have three open sets W ⊆ V ⊆ U , then the composite   (Locality) If ( U i ) is an open covering of an open set U , and if s , t ∈ F ( U ) are such that s | U i = t | U i for each set U i of the covering, then s = t ; and  (Gluing) If ( U i ) is an open covering of an open set U , and if for each i a section s i ∈ F ( U i ) is given such that for each pair U i , U j of the covering sets the restrictions of s i and s j agree on the overlaps: s i | U i ∩ U j = s j | U i ∩ U j , then there is a section s ∈ F ( U ) such that s | U i = s i for each i .   The collection of all such objects is called a sheaf . If only the first two properties are satisfied, it is a pre-sheaf .  Left- and right-restriction  More generally, the restriction (or domain restriction or left-restriction )    A  ◁  R      A  normal-◁  R    A◁R   of a binary relation    R   R   R   between   E   E   E   and   F   F   F   may be defined as a relation having domain   A   A   A   , codomain   F   F   F   and graph . Similarly, one can define a right-restriction or range restriction     R  ▷  B      R  normal-▷  B    R▷B   . Indeed, one could define a restriction to    n   n   n   -ary relations, as well as to subsets understood as relations, such as ones of    E  ×  F      E  normal-×  F    E×F   for binary relations. These cases do not fit into the scheme of sheaves .  Anti-restriction  The domain anti-restriction (or domain subtraction ) of a function or binary relation   R   R   R   (with domain   E   E   E   and codomain   F   F   F   ) by a set   A   A   A   may be defined as     (    E   A   )   ◁  R        E  A   normal-◁  R    (E\ A)◁R   ; it removes all elements of   A   A   A   from the domain   E   E   E   . It is sometimes denoted   A   A   A   ⩤   R   R   R   . 5 Similarly, the range anti-restriction (or range subtraction ) of a function or binary relation   R   R   R   by a set   B   B   B   is defined as    R  ▷   (    F   B   )       R  normal-▷    F  B     R▷(F\ B)   ; it removes all elements of   B   B   B   from the codomain   F   F   F   . It is sometimes denoted   R   R   R   ⩥   B   B   B   .
