Trans-feruloyl-CoA hydratase




Trans-feruloyl-CoA hydratase

In enzymology, a trans-feruloyl-CoA hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl-beta-hydroxypropanoyl-CoA 
 
 
 
  trans-feruloyl-CoA + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl-beta-hydroxypropanoyl-CoA, and two products, trans-feruloyl-CoA and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl-beta-hydroxypropanoyl-CoA hydro-lyase (trans-feruloyl-CoA-forming). This enzyme is also called trans-feruloyl-CoA hydro-lyase (incorrect).
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
