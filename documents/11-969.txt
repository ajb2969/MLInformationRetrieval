   Piperidine N-piperoyltransferase      Piperidine N-piperoyltransferase   In enzymology , a piperidine N-piperoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (E,E)-piperoyl-CoA + piperidine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + N-[(E,E)-piperoyl]-piperidine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (E,E)-piperoyl-CoA and piperidine , whereas its two products are CoA and [[N-[(E,E)-piperoyl]-piperidine]].  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (E,E)-piperoyl-CoA:piperidine N-piperoyltransferase . Other names in common use include piperidine piperoyltransferase , and piperoyl-CoA:piperidine N-piperoyltransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
