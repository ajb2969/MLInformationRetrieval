Draft:Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle



A Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle or HAIV, is a spacecraft designed to divert an asteroid's orbital path. A HAIV consists of a kinetic-impact leader spacecraft and a follower spacecraft carrying nuclear explosives. The proposed idea for a HAIV consists of two spacecrafts following each other. The first spacecraft will consist of a kinetic energy impact crater in order for the second space craft to efficiently disrupt or divert the NEO (Near Earth Object). The Planetary Defense Task Force of the NASA Advisory Council and The Iowa State University Asteroid Deflection Center , is currently involved in developing mission details and designs for HAIV. The HAIV was developed by the ADRC (Asteroid Deflection Research Center), through a 2011 NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts Phase I study. Professor Bong Wie, director of The Iowa State University Asteroid Deflection Center was granted a $100K award from the NIAC to continue the development of HAIV into Phase II.
HAIV Concept
The most common HAIV concept uses a leading spacecraft and a follower spacecraft. The leading spacecraft provides proper kinetic-impact crater conditions and the following spacecraft will contain a NED (Nuclear Explosive Device). The leading spacecraft is responsible for impacting the surface of the NEO and creating a crater. The following spacecraft will then impact the cater, exploding at the crater's most vulnerable point. This is the most recommended HAIV concept due to the short warning time that NASA assumes to have when a NEO is spotted. This design also allows the NED or spacecraft to be altered according to the size of the NEO.
Non-Nuclear Concepts
Gravity Tractors
A low energy HAIV concept was proposed which deflects the NEO. The concept utilizes the gravitational force between a hovering spacecraft and a target NEO as a towline. To avoid exhaust plume impingement on the NEOs surface, two engines are tilted outward and the hovering distance is d=1.5r and θ=20˚. A simple spherical body is considered for this concept. Realistically, a large 20 ton gravity tractor spacecraft needs to be propelled by nuclear electric system. The principle behind the GT concept towing asteroid Apophis,

Where ∆V and ∆X are, respectably, the resulting velocity and position changes for the total towing speed of ∆t.
HAIV Mission Requirements
A practical design solution is required to deliver an effective subsurface explosion through a direct intercept trajectory to neutralize the probable impact threat of NEOs with a short warning time. Nuclear disruption strategies to be deployed last minute include, standoff explosions, surface contact bursts, and subsurface explosions. The preferred approach to disrupt a NEO is a nuclear standoff explosion at a predetermined height. A second nuclear option releases a contact burst on the NEO's surface. The most efficient nuclear option involves a subsurface explosion. This is the most common design due to the short warning time NASA predicts to have. There is an assumed 10 year warning time meaning the spacecraft will have to impact at ∆V 10-30km/s. This eliminates the chances of having a fly by or landing mission on the NEO.
