   Muconolactone Delta-isomerase      Muconolactone Delta-isomerase   In enzymology , a muconolactone Delta-isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-5-oxo-2,5-dihydrofuran-2-acetate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-oxo-4,5-dihydrofuran-2-acetate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (S)-5-oxo-2,5-dihydrofuran-2-acetate , and one product , 5-oxo-4,5-dihydrofuran-2-acetate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases transposing C=C bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-oxo-4,5-dihydrofuran-2-acetate Delta3-Delta2-isomerase . This enzyme is also called muconolactone isomerase . This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
