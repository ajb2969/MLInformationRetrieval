Hopf theorem

The Hopf theorem is a statement in differential topology, saying that the topological degree is the only homotopy invariant of continuous maps to spheres.
Formal statement
Let M be an n-dimensional compact oriented manifold and Sn the n-sphere and 
 
 
 
  be continuous. Then 
 
 
 
  if and only if f and g are homotopic.
