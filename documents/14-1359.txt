   Hopf theorem      Hopf theorem   The Hopf theorem is a statement in differential topology , saying that the topological degree is the only homotopy invariant of continuous maps to spheres .  Formal statement  Let M be an n -dimensional compact  oriented manifold and S n the n -sphere and     f  ,  g   :   M  →   S  n       normal-:   f  g    normal-→  M   superscript  S  n      f,g:M\to S^{n}   be continuous. Then     deg   (  f  )    =   deg   (  g  )         degree  f    degree  g     \deg(f)=\deg(g)   if and only if f and g are homotopic .
