   Polar sine      Polar sine   In geometry , the polar sine generalizes the sine function of angle to the vertex angle of a polytope . It is denoted by psin .  Definition  n vectors in n -dimensional space  (Figure)  The interpretations of 3d volumes for left: a parallelepiped (Ω in polar sine definition) and right: a cuboid (Π in definition). The interpretation is similar in higher dimensions.   Let v 1 , ..., v n , for n ≥ 2, be non-zero Euclidean vectors in n -dimensional space (ℝ n ) that are directed from a vertex of a parallelotope, forming the edges of the parallelotope. The polar sine of the vertex angle is:        psin   (   𝕧  1   ,  …  ,   𝕧  n   )    =   Ω  Π    ,       psin   subscript  𝕧  1   normal-…   subscript  𝕧  n      normal-Ω  normal-Π     \operatorname{psin}(\mathbb{v}_{1},\dots,\mathbb{v}_{n})=\frac{\Omega}{\Pi},     where the numerator is the determinant     Ω   normal-Ω   \displaystyle\Omega     equal to the hyper volume of the parallelotope with vector edges 1      𝐯  1     subscript  𝐯  1    \displaystyle\mathbf{v}_{1}     and in the denominator the n -fold product      Π  =    ∏   i  =  1   n    ∥   𝕧  i   ∥        normal-Π    superscript   subscript  product    i  1    n    norm   subscript  𝕧  i       \Pi=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\|\mathbb{v}_{i}\|     of the magnitudes || v i || of the vectors equals the hypervolume of the n -dimensional hyperrectangle , with edges equal to the magnitudes of the vectors || v 1 ||, || v 2 ||, ... || v n || (not the vectors themselves). Also see Ericksson. 2  The parallelotope is like a "squashed hyperrectangle", so it has less hypervolume than the hyperrectangle, meaning (see image for the 3d case):      Ω  ≤  Π  ⇒   Ω  Π   ≤  1        normal-Ω  normal-Π    normal-⇒      normal-Ω  normal-Π        1     \Omega\leq\Pi\Rightarrow\frac{\Omega}{\Pi}\leq 1     and since this ratio can be negative, psin is always bounded between −1 and +1 by the inequalities :        -  1   ≤   psin   (   𝕧  1   ,  …  ,   𝕧  n   )    ≤  1   ,          1    psin   subscript  𝕧  1   normal-…   subscript  𝕧  n         1     -1\leq\operatorname{psin}(\mathbb{v}_{1},\dots,\mathbb{v}_{n})\leq 1,\,   as for the ordinary sine, with either bound only being reached in case all vectors are mutually orthogonal .  In case n = 2, the polar sine is the ordinary sine of the angle between the two vectors.  n vectors in m -dimensional space for m > n  A non-negative version of the polar sine exists for the case that the vectors lie in a space of higher dimension. In this case, the numerator in the definition is given as       Ω  =     det   (     [      𝐯  1      𝐯  2     ⋯     𝐯  n      ]   T    [      𝐯  1      𝐯  2     ⋯     𝐯  n      ]    )       ,      normal-Ω         superscript     subscript  𝐯  1    subscript  𝐯  2   normal-⋯   subscript  𝐯  n     T      subscript  𝐯  1    subscript  𝐯  2   normal-⋯   subscript  𝐯  n          \Omega=\sqrt{\det\left(\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{v}_{1}&\mathbf{v}_{2}&\cdots&%
 \mathbf{v}_{n}\end{bmatrix}^{T}\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{v}_{1}&\mathbf{v}_{2}&%
 \cdots&\mathbf{v}_{n}\end{bmatrix}\right)}\,,   where the superscript T indicates matrix transposition . In the case that m = n , the value of Ω for this non-negative definition of the polar sine is the absolute value of the Ω from the signed version of the polar sine given previously.  Properties   Negation   If the dimension of the space is more than n , then the polar sine is non-negative; otherwise it changes signs whenever two of the vectors v j and v k are interchanged - due to the antisymmetry of row-exchanging in the determinant:     Ω   normal-Ω   \displaystyle\Omega      Invariance under scalar multiplication of vectors   The polar sine does not change if all of the vectors v 1 , ..., v n are multiplied by positive constants c i , due to factorization :      psin   (    c  1    𝕧  1    ,  …  ,    c  n    𝕧  n    )      psin     subscript  c  1    subscript  𝕧  1    normal-…     subscript  c  n    subscript  𝕧  n      \displaystyle\operatorname{psin}(c_{1}\mathbb{v}_{1},\dots,c_{n}\mathbb{v}_{n})     If an odd number of these constants are instead negative, then the sign of the polar sine will change; however, its absolute value will remain unchanged.
