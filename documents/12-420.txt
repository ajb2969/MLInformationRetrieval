Polar sine

In geometry, the polar sine generalizes the sine function of angle to the vertex angle of a polytope. It is denoted by psin.
Definition
n vectors in n-dimensional space

The interpretations of 3d volumes for left: a parallelepiped (Ω in polar sine definition) and right: a cuboid (Π in definition). The interpretation is similar in higher dimensions.

Let v1, ..., vn, for n ≥ 2, be non-zero Euclidean vectors in n-dimensional space (ℝn) that are directed from a vertex of a parallelotope, forming the edges of the parallelotope. The polar sine of the vertex angle is:



where the numerator is the determinant



equal to the hypervolume of the parallelotope with vector edges1



and in the denominator the n-fold product



of the magnitudes ||vi|| of the vectors equals the hypervolume of the n-dimensional hyperrectangle, with edges equal to the magnitudes of the vectors ||v1||, ||v2||, ... ||vn|| (not the vectors themselves). Also see Ericksson.2
The parallelotope is like a "squashed hyperrectangle", so it has less hypervolume than the hyperrectangle, meaning (see image for the 3d case):



and since this ratio can be negative, psin is always bounded between −1 and +1 by the inequalities:


 
  as for the ordinary sine, with either bound only being reached in case all vectors are mutually orthogonal.
In case n = 2, the polar sine is the ordinary sine of the angle between the two vectors.
n vectors in m-dimensional space for m > n
A non-negative version of the polar sine exists for the case that the vectors lie in a space of higher dimension. In this case, the numerator in the definition is given as


 
  where the superscript T indicates matrix transposition. In the case that m=n, the value of Ω for this non-negative definition of the polar sine is the absolute value of the Ω from the signed version of the polar sine given previously.
Properties

Negation

If the dimension of the space is more than n, then the polar sine is non-negative; otherwise it changes signs whenever two of the vectors vj and vk are interchanged - due to the antisymmetry of row-exchanging in the determinant:




Invariance under scalar multiplication of vectors

The polar sine does not change if all of the vectors v1, ..., vn are multiplied by positive constants ci, due to factorization:



If an odd number of these constants are instead negative, then the sign of the polar sine will change; however, its absolute value will remain unchanged.
History
Polar sines were investigated by Euler in the 18th century.3
