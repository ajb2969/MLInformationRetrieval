   Curvature invariant      Curvature invariant   In Riemannian geometry and pseudo-Riemannian geometry , curvature invariants are scalar quantities constructed from tensors that represent curvature . These tensors are usually the Riemann tensor , the Weyl tensor , the Ricci tensor and tensors formed from these by the operations of taking dual  contractions and covariant differentiations .  Types of curvature invariants  The invariants most often considered are polynomial invariants . These are polynomials constructed from contractions such as traces. Second degree examples are called quadratic invariants , and so forth. Invariants constructed using covariant derivatives up to order n are called n-th order differential invariants .  The Riemann tensor is a multilinear operator of fourth rank acting on tangent vectors . However, it can also be considered a linear operator acting on bivectors , and as such it has a characteristic polynomial , whose coefficients and roots ( eigenvalues ) are polynomial scalar invariants.  Physical applications  In metric theories of gravitation such as general relativity , curvature scalars play an important role in telling distinct spacetimes apart.  Two of the most basic curvature invariants in general relativity are the Kretschmann scalar        R   a  b  c  d      R   a  b  c  d         subscript  R    a  b  c  d     superscript  R    a  b  c  d      R_{abcd}\,R^{abcd}     and the Chern–Pontryagin scalar ,        R   a  b  c  d      R    a  b  c  d     ⋆        subscript  R    a  b  c  d     superscript   superscript  R    a  b  c  d    normal-⋆     R_{abcd}\,{{}^{\star}\!R}^{abcd}     These are analogous to two familiar quadratic invariants of the electromagnetic field tensor in classical electromagnetism.  An important unsolved problem in general relativity is to give a basis (and any syzygies ) for the zero-th order invariants of the Riemann tensor.  They have limitations because many distinct spacetimes cannot be distinguished on this basis. In particular, so called VSI spacetimes (including pp-waves as well as some other Petrov type N and III spacetimes) cannot be distinguished from Minkowski spacetime using any number of polynomial curvature invariants (of any order).
