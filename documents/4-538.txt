   Row vector      Row vector   In linear algebra , a row vector or row matrix is a 1 √ó m  matrix , i.e. a matrix consisting of a single row of m elements: 1       ùê±  =   [      x  1      x  2     ‚Ä¶     x  m      ]    .      ùê±     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  m       \mathbf{x}=\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}&x_{2}&\dots&x_{m}\end{bmatrix}.     The transpose of a row vector is a column vector :         [        x  1      x  2     ‚Ä¶    x  m       ]   T   =   [      x  1        x  2       ‚ãÆ       x  m      ]    .       superscript       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  m      normal-T      subscript  x  1      subscript  x  2     normal-‚ãÆ     subscript  x  m       \begin{bmatrix}x_{1}\;x_{2}\;\dots\;x_{m}\end{bmatrix}^{\rm T}=\begin{bmatrix}%
 x_{1}\\
 x_{2}\\
 \vdots\\
 x_{m}\end{bmatrix}.     The set of all row vectors forms a vector space ( row space ) which acts like the dual space to the set of all column vectors (see row and column spaces) , in the sense that any linear functional on the space of column vectors (i.e. any element of the dual space) can be represented uniquely as a dot product with a specific row vector.  Notation  Row vectors are sometimes written using the following non-standard notation:       ùê±  =   [       x  1   ,   x  2   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  m       ]    .      ùê±      subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  m        \mathbf{x}=\begin{bmatrix}x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{m}\end{bmatrix}.     Operations   Matrix multiplication involves the action of multiplying each row vector of one matrix by each column vector of another matrix.    The dot product of two vectors a and b is equivalent to multiplying the row vector representation of a by the column vector representation of b :         ùêö  ‚ãÖ  ùêõ   =    [      a  1      a  2      a  3      ]    [      b  1        b  2        b  3      ]     .       normal-‚ãÖ  ùêö  ùêõ        subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2    subscript  a  3        subscript  b  1      subscript  b  2      subscript  b  3        \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}=\begin{bmatrix}a_{1}&a_{2}&a_{3}\end{bmatrix}\begin{%
 bmatrix}b_{1}\\
 b_{2}\\
 b_{3}\end{bmatrix}.     Preferred input vectors for matrix transformations  Frequently a row vector presents itself for an operation within n-space expressed by an n by n matrix M :   v M = p .   Then p is also a row vector and may present to another n by n matrix Q :   p Q = t.   Conveniently, one can write t = p Q = v MQ telling us that the matrix product transformation MQ can take v directly to t . Continuing with row vectors, matrix transformations further reconfiguring n-space can be applied to the right of previous outputs.  In contrast, when a column vector is transformed to become another column under an n by n matrix action, the operation occurs to the left:   p = M v and t = Q p ,   leading to the algebraic expression QM v for the composed output from v input. The matrix transformations mount up to the left in this use of a column vector for input to matrix transformation. The natural bias to read left-to-right, as subsequent transformations are applied in linear algebra, stands against column vector inputs.  Nevertheless, using the transpose operation these differences between inputs of a row or column nature are resolved by an antihomomorphism between the groups arising on the two sides. The technical construction uses the dual space associated with a vector space to develop the transpose of a linear map .  For an instance where this row vector input convention has been used to good effect see Raiz Usmani, 2 where on page 106 the convention allows the statement "The product mapping ST of U into W [is given] by:       Œ±   (   S  T   )    =    (   Œ±  S   )   T   =   Œ≤  T   =  Œ≥          Œ±    S  T        Œ±  S   T          Œ≤  T        Œ≥     \alpha(ST)=(\alpha S)T=\beta T=\gamma   ." (The Greek letters represent row vectors).  Ludwik Silberstein used row vectors for spacetime events; he applied Lorentz transformation matrices on the right in his Theory of Relativity in 1914 (see page 143). In 1963 when McGraw-Hill published Differential Geometry by Heinrich Guggenheimer of the University of Minnesota , he uses the row vector convention in chapter 5, "Introduction to transformation groups" (eqs. 7a,9b and 12 to 15). When H. S. M. Coxeter reviewed 3  Linear Geometry by Rafael Artzy , he wrote, "[Artzy] is to be congratulated on his choice of the 'left-to-right' convention, which enables him to regard a point as a row matrix instead of the clumsy column that many authors prefer."
