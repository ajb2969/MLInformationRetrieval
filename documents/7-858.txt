   Polynomial transformations      Polynomial transformations   In mathematics , a polynomial transformation consists of computing the polynomial whose roots are a given function of the roots of polynomial. Polynomial transformations such as Tschirnhaus transformations are often used to simplify the solution of algebraic equations .  Simple examples  Translating the roots  Let       P   (  x  )    =     a  0    x  n    +    a  1    x   n  -  1     +  ⋯  +   a  n          P  x        subscript  a  0    superscript  x  n       subscript  a  1    superscript  x    n  1     normal-⋯   subscript  a  n      P(x)=a_{0}x^{n}+a_{1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n}   be a polynomial, and       α  1   ,  …  ,   α  n       subscript  α  1   normal-…   subscript  α  n     \alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{n}   be its complex roots (not necessarily distinct).  For a any constant   c   c   c   , the polynomial whose roots are        α  1   +  c   ,  …  ,    α  n   +  c         subscript  α  1   c   normal-…     subscript  α  n   c     \alpha_{1}+c,\ldots,\alpha_{n}+c   is        Q   (  y  )    =   P   (   y  -  c   )    =     a  0     (   y  -  c   )   n    +    a  1     (   y  -  c   )    n  -  1     +  ⋯  +   a  n     .          Q  y     P    y  c              subscript  a  0    superscript    y  c   n       subscript  a  1    superscript    y  c     n  1     normal-⋯   subscript  a  n       Q(y)=P(y-c)=a_{0}(y-c)^{n}+a_{1}(y-c)^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n}.     If the coefficients of   P   P   P   are integers and the constant    c  =   p  q       c    p  q     c=\frac{p}{q}   is a rational number , the coefficients of   Q   Q   Q   may be not integer, but the polynomial has integers coefficients and has the same roots as   Q   Q   Q   .  A special case is when     c  =    a  1    a  0     .      c     subscript  a  1    subscript  a  0      c=\frac{a_{1}}{a_{0}}.   The resulting polynomial   Q   Q   Q   does not have any term in .  Reciprocals of the roots  Let       P   (  x  )    =     a  0    x  n    +    a  1    x   n  -  1     +  ⋯  +   a  n          P  x        subscript  a  0    superscript  x  n       subscript  a  1    superscript  x    n  1     normal-⋯   subscript  a  n      P(x)=a_{0}x^{n}+a_{1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n}   be a polynomial. The polynomial whose roots are the reciprocals of the roots of   P   P   P   as roots is its reciprocal polynomial        Q   (  y  )    =    y  n   P   (   1  y   )    =     a  n    y  n    +    a   n  -  1     y   n  -  1     +  ⋯  +   a  0     .          Q  y      superscript  y  n   P    1  y              subscript  a  n    superscript  y  n       subscript  a    n  1     superscript  y    n  1     normal-⋯   subscript  a  0       Q(y)=y^{n}P\left(\frac{1}{y}\right)=a_{n}y^{n}+a_{n-1}y^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{0}.     Scaling the roots  Let       P   (  x  )    =     a  0    x  n    +    a  1    x   n  -  1     +  ⋯  +   a  n          P  x        subscript  a  0    superscript  x  n       subscript  a  1    superscript  x    n  1     normal-⋯   subscript  a  n      P(x)=a_{0}x^{n}+a_{1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n}   be a polynomial, and   c   c   c   be a non-zero constant. A polynomial whose roots are the product by   c   c   c   of the roots of   P   P   P   is        Q   (  y  )    =    c  n   P   (   y  c   )    =     a  0    y  n    +    a  1   c   y   n  -  1     +  ⋯  +    a  n    c  n      .          Q  y      superscript  c  n   P    y  c              subscript  a  0    superscript  y  n       subscript  a  1   c   superscript  y    n  1     normal-⋯     subscript  a  n    superscript  c  n        Q(y)=c^{n}P\left(\frac{y}{c}\right)=a_{0}y^{n}+a_{1}cy^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n}c^{n}.   The factor appears here because, if   c   c   c   and the coefficients of   P   P   P   are integers or belong to some integral domain , the same is true for the coefficients of   Q   Q   Q   .  In the special case where    c  =   a  0       c   subscript  a  0     c=a_{0}   , all coefficients of   Q   Q   Q   are multiple of   c   c   c   , and    Q  c      Q  c    \frac{Q}{c}   is a monic polynomial , whose coefficients belong to any integral domain containing   c   c   c   and the coefficients of   P   P   P   . This polynomial transformation is often used to reduce questions on algebraic numbers to questions on algebraic integers .  Combining this with a translation of the roots by     a  1    a  0        subscript  a  1    subscript  a  0     \frac{a_{1}}{a_{0}}   , allows to reduce any question on the roots of a polynomial, such as root-finding , to a similar question on a simpler polynomial, which is monic and does not have a term of degree    n  −  1      n  normal-−  1    n−1   . For examples of this, see Cubic function § Reduction to a depressed cubic or Quartic function § Converting to a depressed quartic .  Transformation by a rational function  All preceding examples are polynomial transformations by a rational function , also called Tschirnhaus transformations . Let       f   (  x  )    =    g   (  x  )     h   (  x  )           f  x       g  x     h  x      f(x)=\frac{g(x)}{h(x)}   be a rational function, where   g   g   g   and   h   h   h   are coprime polynomials. The polynomial transformation of a polynomial   P   P   P   by   f   f   f   is the polynomial   Q   Q   Q   (defined up to the product by a non-zero constant) whose roots are the images by   f   f   f   of the roots of   P   P   P   .  Such a polynomial transformation may be computed as a resultant . In fact, the roots of the desired polynomial   Q   Q   Q   are exactly the complex numbers    y   y   y   such that there is a complex number   x   x   x   such one has simultaneously (if the coefficients of    P  ,  g     P  g    P,g   and   h   h   h   are not real or complex numbers, "complex number" has to be replaced by "element of an algebraically closed field containing the coefficients of the input polynomials" )      P   (  x  )       P  x    \displaystyle P(x)   This is exactly the defining property of the resultant       Res  x    (     y   h   (  x  )    -   g   (  x  )     ,   P   (  x  )    )       subscript  Res  x       y  h  x     g  x      P  x     \operatorname{Res}_{x}(y\,h(x)-g(x),P(x))     This is generally difficult to compute this through a hand-written computation. However, as most computer algebra systems have a built-in function to compute resultants, it is straightforward to compute it with a computer .  Properties  If the polynomial   P   P   P   is irreducible , then either the resulting polynomial   Q   Q   Q   is irreducible, or it is a power of an irreducible polynomial. Let   α   α   \alpha   be a root of   P   P   P   and consider   L   L   L   , the field extension generated by   α   α   \alpha   . The former case means that    f   (  α  )       f  α    f(\alpha)   is a primitive element of   L   L   L   , which has   Q   Q   Q   as minimal polynomial . In the latter case,    f   (  α  )       f  α    f(\alpha)   belongs to a subfield of   L   L   L   and its minimal polynomial is the irreducible polynomial that has   Q   Q   Q   as power.  Transformation for equation-solving  Polynomial transformations have been applied to the simplification of polynomial equations for solution, where possible, by radicals. Descartes introduced the transformation of a polynomial of degree d which eliminates the term of degree d −1 by a translation of the roots. Such a polynomial is termed "depressed": this already suffices to solve the quadratic by square roots. In the case of the cubic, Tschirnhaus transformations replace the variable by a quadratic function, thereby making it possible to eliminate two terms, and so can be used to eliminate the linear term in a depressed cubic to achieve the solution of the cubic by a combination of square and cube roots. The Bring–Jerrard transformation, which is quartic in the variable, brings a quintic into "principal" or Bring-Jerrard normal form with terms of degree 5,1 and zero.
