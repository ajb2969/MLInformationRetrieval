257-gon

In geometry, a 257-gon is a polygon with 257 sides. The sum of the interior angles of any non-self-intersecting 257-gon is 91800°.
The area of a regular 257-gon is (with )



A whole regular 257-gon is not visually discernible from a circle, and its perimeter differs from that of the circumscribed circle by about 24 parts per million.
Regular 257-gon construction
The regular 257-gon (one with all sides equal and all angles equal) is of interest for being a constructible polygon: that is, it can be constructed using a compass and an unmarked straightedge. This is because 257 is a Fermat prime, being of the form 22n + 1 (in this case n = 3). Thus, the values 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are 128-degree algebraic numbers, and like all constructible numbers they can be written using square roots and no higher-order roots.
Although it was known to Gauss by 1801 that the regular 257-gon was constructible, the first explicit constructions of a regular 257-gon were given by Magnus Georg Paucker (1822)1 and Friedrich Julius Richelot (1832).2 Another method involves the use of 150 circles, 24 being Carlyle circles: this method is pictured below. One of these Carlyle circles solves the quadratic equation x2 + x − 64 = 0.3

257-gram
A 257-gram is a 257-sided star polygon. As 257 is prime, there are 127 regular forms generated by Schläfli symbols {257/n} for all integers 2 ≤ n ≤ 128 as 
 
 
 
 
 .
Below is a view of {257/128}, with 257 nearly radial edges, with its star vertex internal angles 180/257° (~0.7°).4






 
Approximate construction of the first side from 257-gon
Since the exact construction of the 257-gon is very extensive and can not be clearly displayed, hereinafter the first side is shown as an approximate construction.


 
  AME1 = 1.40077828746899...° ; 360° : 257 = 1.40077821011673...° ; 
 
 
 
  AME1 - 360° : 257 = 7.73...E-8°
Example to illustrating the error: At a circumscribed circle r = 1000 km (air-line distance London - Munich approximate 918 km), the absolute error of the 1st side would be approximately 1.35 mm.
