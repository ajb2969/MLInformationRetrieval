   Malecot's method of coancestry      Malecot's method of coancestry   Malecot's coancestry coefficient ,    f   f   f    , refers to an indirect measure of genetic similarity of two individuals which was initially devised by the French mathematician Gustave Malécot .     f   f   f   is defined as the probability that any two alleles , sampled at random (one from each individual), are identical copies of an ancestral allele. In species with well-known lineages (such as domesticated crops),   f   f   f   can be calculated by examining detailed pedigree records. Modernly,   f   f   f   can be estimated using genetic marker data.  Evolution of inbreeding coefficient in finite size populations  In a finite size population , after some generations, all individuals will have a common ancestor     f  →  1     normal-→  f  1    f\rightarrow 1   . Consider a non-sexual population of fixed size   N   N   N   , and call    f  i     subscript  f  i    f_{i}   the inbreeding coefficient of generation   i   i   i   . Here,   f   f   f   means the probability that two individuals picked at random will have a common ancestor. At each generation, each individual produces a large number    k  ≫  1     much-greater-than  k  1    k\gg 1   of descendants, from the pool of which   N   N   N   individual will be chosen at random to form the new generation.  At generation   n   n   n   , the probability that two individuals have a common ancestor is "they have a common parent" OR "they descend from two distinct individuals which have a common ancestor" :       f  n   =     k  -  1    k  N    +     k   (   N  -  1   )     k  N     f   n  -  1           subscript  f  n         k  1     k  N          k    N  1      k  N     subscript  f    n  1        f_{n}=\frac{k-1}{kN}+\frac{k(N-1)}{kN}f_{n-1}           ≈    1  N   +    (   1  -   1  N    )    f   n  -  1       .      absent      1  N       1    1  N     subscript  f    n  1        \approx\frac{1}{N}+(1-\frac{1}{N})f_{n-1}.     This is a recurrence relation easily solved. Considering the worst case where at generation zero, no two individuals have a common ancestor,       f  0   =  0       subscript  f  0   0    f_{0}=0   , we get        f  n   =   1  -    (   1  -   1  N    )   n     .       subscript  f  n     1   superscript    1    1  N    n      f_{n}=1-(1-\frac{1}{N})^{n}.     The scale of the fixation time (average number of generation it takes to homogenize the population) is therefore        n  ¯   =   -   1  /   log   (   1  -   1  /  N    )      ≈  N   .         normal-¯  n       1      1    1  N            N     \bar{n}=-1/\log(1-1/N)\approx N.     This computation trivially extends to the inbreeding coefficients of alleles in a sexual population by changing   N   N   N   to    2  N      2  N    2N   (the number of gametes ).
