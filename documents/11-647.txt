   2,5-dioxopiperazine hydrolase      2,5-dioxopiperazine hydrolase   In enzymology , a 2,5-dioxopiperazine hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2,5-dioxopiperazine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycylglycine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2,5-dioxopiperazine and H 2 O , whereas its product is glycylglycine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,5-dioxopiperazine amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include cyclo(Gly-Gly) hydrolase , and cyclo(glycylglycine) hydrolase .
