   Nagao's theorem      Nagao's theorem   In mathematics , Nagao's theorem , named after Hirosi Nagao , is a result about the structure of the group of 2-by-2 invertible matrices over the ring of polynomials over a field . It has been extended by Serre to give a description of the structure of the corresponding matrix group over the coordinate ring of a projective curve .  Nagao's theorem  For a general ring  R we let GL 2 ( R ) denote the group of invertible 2-by-2 matrices with entries in R , and let R * denote the group of units of R , and let        B   (  R  )    =   {   (     a    b                        0    d                       )   :     a  ,  d   ∈   R  *    ,   b  ∈  R    }    .

 0&d\end{array}}\right):a,d\in R^{*},~{}b\in R}\right\}.     Then B ( R ) is a subgroup of GL 2 ( R ).  Nagao's theorem states that in the case that R is the ring K [ t ] of polynomials in one variable over a field K , the group GL 2 ( R ) is the amalgamated product of GL 2 ( K ) and B ( K [ t ]) over their intersection B ( K ).  Serre's extension  In this setting, C is a smooth projective curve C over a field K . For a closed point  P of C let R be the corresponding coordinate ring of C with P removed. There exists a graph of groups ( G , T ) where T is a tree with at most one non-terminal vertex, such that GL 2 ( R ) is isomorphic to the fundamental group π 1 ( G , T ).
