3-phytase

In enzymology, a 3-phytase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

myo-inositol hexakisphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  1D-myo-inositol 1,2,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are myo-inositol hexakisphosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are 1D-myo-inositol 1,2,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is myo-inositol-hexakisphosphate 3-phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include 1-phytase, phytase, phytate 1-phosphatase, and phytate 6-phosphatase. This enzyme participates in inositol phosphate metabolism.
