   Fredholm integral equation      Fredholm integral equation   In mathematics , the Fredholm integral equation is an integral equation whose solution gives rise to Fredholm theory , the study of Fredholm kernels and Fredholm operators . The integral equation was studied by Ivar Fredholm .  Equation of the first kind  Fredholm Equation is an Integral Equation in which the term containing the Kernel Function (defined below) has constants as integration limits. A closely related form is the Volterra integral equation which has variable integral limits.  An inhomogeneous Fredholm equation of the first kind is written as:       g   (  t  )    =    ∫  a  b    K   (  t  ,  s  )   f   (  s  )   d  s          g  t     superscript   subscript   a   b     K   t  s   f  s  normal-d  s      g(t)=\int_{a}^{b}K(t,s)f(s)\,\mathrm{d}s     and the problem is, given the continuous kernel function    K   (  t  ,  s  )       K   t  s     K(t,s)   , and the function    g   (  t  )       g  t    g(t)   , to find the function    f   (  s  )       f  s    f(s)   .  If the kernel is a function only of the difference of its arguments, namely     K   (  t  ,  s  )    =   K   (   t  -  s   )          K   t  s      K    t  s      K(t,s)=K(t-s)   , and the limits of integration are    ±  ∞     plus-or-minus     \pm\infty   , then the right hand side of the equation can be rewritten as a convolution of the functions K and f and therefore the solution will be given by       f   (  t  )    =    ℱ  ω   -  1     [     ℱ  t    [   g   (  t  )    ]    (  ω  )      ℱ  t    [   K   (  t  )    ]    (  ω  )     ]    =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞       ℱ  t    [   g   (  t  )    ]    (  ω  )      ℱ  t    [   K   (  t  )    ]    (  ω  )      e   2  π  i  ω  t    d  ω            f  t      superscript   subscript  ℱ  ω     1     delimited-[]       subscript  ℱ  t    delimited-[]    g  t    ω      subscript  ℱ  t    delimited-[]    K  t    ω             superscript   subscript                 subscript  ℱ  t    delimited-[]    g  t    ω      subscript  ℱ  t    delimited-[]    K  t    ω     superscript  e    2  π  i  ω  t    normal-d  ω       f(t)=\mathcal{F}_{\omega}^{-1}\left[{\mathcal{F}_{t}[g(t)](\omega)\over%
 \mathcal{F}_{t}[K(t)](\omega)}\right]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{\mathcal{F}_{t}[%
 g(t)](\omega)\over\mathcal{F}_{t}[K(t)](\omega)}e^{2\pi i\omega t}\mathrm{d}\omega     where    ℱ  t     subscript  ℱ  t    \mathcal{F}_{t}   and    ℱ  ω   -  1      superscript   subscript  ℱ  ω     1     \mathcal{F}_{\omega}^{-1}   are the direct and inverse Fourier transforms respectively.  Equation of the second kind  An inhomogeneous Fredholm equation of the second kind is given as        ϕ   (  t  )    =    f   (  t  )    +   λ    ∫  a  b    K   (  t  ,  s  )   ϕ   (  s  )   d  s       .        ϕ  t       f  t     λ    superscript   subscript   a   b     K   t  s   ϕ  s  normal-d  s        \phi(t)=f(t)+\lambda\int_{a}^{b}K(t,s)\phi(s)\,\mathrm{d}s.     Given the kernel    K   (  t  ,  s  )       K   t  s     K(t,s)   , and the function    f   (  t  )       f  t    f(t)   , the problem is typically to find the function    ϕ   (  t  )       ϕ  t    \phi(t)   . A standard approach to solving this is to use the resolvent formalism ; written as a series, the solution is known as the Liouville-Neumann series .  General theory  The general theory underlying the Fredholm equations is known as Fredholm theory . One of the principal results is that the kernel K is a compact operator . Compactness may be shown by invoking equicontinuity . As an operator, it has a spectral theory that can be understood in terms of a discrete spectrum of eigenvalues that tend to 0.  Applications  Fredholm equations arise naturally in the theory of signal processing , most notably as the famous spectral concentration problem popularized by David Slepian . They also commonly arise in linear forward modeling and inverse problems .
