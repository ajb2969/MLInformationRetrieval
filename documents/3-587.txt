As an in-joke  Forty-seven has been the favorite number of Pomona College , California , USA , since 1964. A mathematical proof , written in 1964 by Professor Donald Bentley , supposedly demonstrates that all numbers are equal to 47. 5 However, Bentley offered it as a "joke proof" to further a popular student research project that listed real and imaginative "47 sightings". Bentley used the invalid proof to introduce his students to the concept of mathematical proofs. 6 The proof used limits to show that the sum of the two equal sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the base side. Bentley chose forty-seven as the base side, but he could have used any number.
