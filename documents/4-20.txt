Computing  There are many mnemonics for the seven layers of the OSI Model in computing. Physical / Data Link / Network / Transport / Session / Presentation / Application  Because the layers are numbered from the bottom-up, many mnemonics have been developed in both directions, from the top down and from the bottom up:  :* People Desperately Need To See Pamela Anderson .  :* Please Do Not Throw Sausage/Salami Pizza Away - starts at layer 1 (the bottom),  :* Programmers Like Networks That Seldom Postpone Anything .  :*Another commonly used mnemonic starts with layer 7; All People Seem To Need Data Processing.

Geography   Latitude and Longitude    Latus is Latin for "side" (latitude lines go from side to side, East-West).  Longitude lines seem "longer" (top to bottom, North-South). Earth resembles the Pear fruit (skinny at the top, fat at the bottom, and the geographic south pole is depressed), Pears are taller than wider.  "Lat is Fat" (latitude goes around the equatorial belt).  "Latitude is FLATitude".  The "n" in longitude may stand for North (and South), the direction that Longitude lines cover on a map.

Differentiating stalactites from stalagmites . 13   The ''' 'mites ''' go up and the ''' 'tites ''' come down. When one has ants in one's pants, the mites go up and the tights come down. (Note: In a strict scientific sense, a mite is not an ant , although "mite" in common speech can refer to any small creature.)  Stalac tites hang tight , hang down like tights on a line; stalag mites  might bite (if you sit on them), might reach the roof.  Tights hang from the Ceiling , and Mites crawling around on the Ground  You need might to do push-ups (from the floor). You must hold tight doing chin-ups (off the ceiling).  Stala c tites are on the c eiling. Stala g mites are on the g round.  Stalac tites cling tight to the ceiling; stalag mites  might reach the ceiling.

L azy C ats D on't M ove ( L, C, D, M ).  To help recall when European explorer Christopher Columbus reached America, remember this rhyme: "In fourteen ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue"  To remember the sequential order (Left to Right) of the Presidents as found on Mount Rushmore, remember this sentence: [ W e J ust L ove R ushmore!] (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Roosevelt)  To recall the colors of the Olympic Rings, remember the following: B ring Y our R ecord B reaking G uy/ G irl! (Blue, Yellow, Red, Black, Green)   Languages  Grammar   Adjective order in English: OSASCOMP (Opinion, Size, Age, Shape, Color, Origin, Material, Purpose) 14  Coordinating conjunctions in English: FANBOY (for, and, nor, but, or, yet).  The distinction between the Spanish verbs ser and estar , both meaning "to be"    "If it's how you are, or where you are, always use estar ."    The vowels used in Latin subjunctives can be remembered with "wE fEAr A frIAr", or "hEr brEAsts Are gIAnt".  German word order: TeKaMoLo (Temporal (time), Kausal (reason), Modal (manner), Lokal (place)).  French consonants that sometimes are pronounced at the end of a word are: CaReFuL (c, r, f, and l).   Onomasty   Given names (masculine and feminine):    Franc i s (h i m) and Franc e s (h e r)   D o n (s o n) and D a wn (d a ughter)    Pronunciation   The pronunciation and lexical ordering of the Japanese vowels:    Ah we soon get old (AIUEO)    Common vowel sounds for several languages including Spanish and Esperanto (one sound per letter):    Pa let me go too (AEIOU)   Law   Common law  felonies : Mrs. Baker: Murder, Rape, Sodomy, Burglary, Arson, Kidnapping, Escape, Robbery    Felony Murder qualifiers in New York : BRAKES: Burglary, Robbery, Arson, Kidnapping, Escape, and Sex crimes    Contracts which need to be in writing: My Legs: Marriage, Year (anything which can't be completed in a year), Land, Estates, Goods (sale of goods or services over $500), Surety    Seven articles of the United States Constitution : L arge E lephants J ump S lowly a nd S ink R apidly: Legislative, Executive, Judicial, Statehood, Amendment, Supremacy, Ratification   Mathematics  Order of operations  PEMDAS- Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication & Division, Addition & Subtraction can be remembered by the phrase: "Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally". In order from left to right. Multiplication then division which ever one comes first then, addition and subtraction which ever one comes first.  BEDMAS - Brackets (parenthesis), Exponents, Division & Multiplication, Addition & Subtraction  Quadratic equation  The articulation of the quadratic equation can be sung to the tune of various songs as a mnemonic device. 15  Trigonometry  ASTC stands for A ll S tudents T ake C alculus, which represents the trigonometric functions that are positive in each quadrant, beginning with the top right and continuing counterclockwise: All, sine, cosine, tangent.  Remembering the definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent can be done by memorizing SOHCAHTOA, which helps to encode Sine = Opposite over Hypotenuse, Cosine = Adjacent over Hypotenuse, and Tangent = Opposite over Adjacent. These mnemonics are more useful if they can be recited in three groups of three words.  Other ways to remember SOHCAHTOA are:   S ome O ld H orses C an A lways H ear T heir O wner A pproaching  S ome O ld H orse C ame A - H oppin' T hrough O ur A lley  S illy O ld H enry C an't A dd H undreds, T ens O r A nything  S ome O ld H ags C an't A lways H ide T heir O ld A ge  S ome O ld H ippie C aught A nother H ippie T ripping O n A cid   SOH-CAH-TOA can also be memorized directly, as the name of a fictitious Native American tribal chief or princess.  Other techniques group the abbreviations differently: SCT,O/H,A/H,O/A, which stands for Sine Cosine Tangent, Opposite/Hypotenuse, Adjacent/Hypotenuse, Opposite/Adjacent. This mnemonic, "SCTOHAHOA", can be committed to memory as " S ally C an T ell, O scar H as A  H at O n A lways". Some students use " H ard O n" as opposed to " H at O n", finding that sexual and humorous mnemonics are often easier to recall.  SPH-CBH-TPB (sine = perpendicular/hypotenuse, cosine = base/hypotenuse, tangent = perpendicular/base)   S ome P eople H ave C urly B rown H air T hrough P roper B rushing  S ome P eople H ave C urly B rown H air T urned P ermanently B lack   Another odd permutation:   O ranges H ave S egments, A pples H ave C ores, O ranges A re Tan gy   Calculus   For remembering the order of taking the derivative of a quotient in calculus, the phrase "lo-di-hi minus hi-di-lo all over lo squared" can be useful, where lo means the bottom, hi means the top, and di means the derivative.         (    h  i  g  h    l  o  w    )   ′   =       l  o  w   ⋅  h   i  g   h  ′    -     h  i   ⋅  l   o   w  ′      l  o   w  2          superscript      h  i  g  h     l  o  w    normal-′          normal-⋅    l  o  w   h   i  g   superscript  h  normal-′       normal-⋅    h  i   l   o   superscript  w  normal-′       l  o   superscript  w  2       \left(\frac{high}{low}\right)^{\prime}=\frac{low\cdot high^{\prime}-hi\cdot low%
 ^{\prime}}{low^{2}}     Another phrase that one may use is: "Bottom d Top, Top d bottom", where "d" stands for derivative (but this mnemonic does not include a reminder of the crucial dividing by the bottom squared).  A phrase memorable for sounding like a square dance call is "Low d high, Less high d low, Draw the line, O'er squared be low."  Pi (π)  The infinitude of digits in an expansion of the mathematical constant pi has inspired numerous literary and mnemonic writings. See the above referred article for many examples.

Spelling  Characteristic sequence of letters   I always comes before E (but after C, E comes before I) 26 27   In most words like fr ie nd, f ie ld, p ie ce,pierce, misch ie f, th ie f, tier, it is " i " which comes before " e " . But on some words with c just before the pair of e and ''i '', like re cei ve, per cei ve, " e " comes before " i " . This can be remembered by the following mnemonic,    I before E , except after C      But this is not always obeyed as in case of w ei rd and w ei gh,w ei ght,h ei ght,n ei ghbor etc. and can be remembered by extending that mnemonic as given below    I before E , except after C   Or when sounded " A " as in n ei ghbor, w ei gh and w ei ght   Or when sounded like " eye " as in h ei ght   And "w ei rd" is just weird      Another variant, which avoids confusion when the two letters represent different sounds instead of a single sound, as in atheist or being, runs    When it says ee  Put i before e  But not after c      Where ever there is a Q there is a U too   Most frequently u follows q . e.g.: Que, queen, question, quack, quark, quartz, quarry, quit, Pique, torque, maca qu e, exchequer. Hence the mnemonic:    Where ever there is a Q there is a U too 28 (But this is violated by some words; see: List of English words containing Q not followed by U )      When two vowels go walking the first does the talking 29   For words like " oa t" or " ea t", here the second letter a is silent and first letter o and e respectively are pronounced in the examples  Letters of specific syllables in a word   BE LIE VE 30     Do not be lie ve a lie .

SEPARATE     Always smell a rat when you spell sep a rat e 37   There was a farmer named Sep and one day his wife saw a rat . She yelled, “ Sep! A rat – E!!!” 38      Distinguishing between similar words   Difference between Advice & Advise, Practice & Practise, Licence & License etc.   Advice, Practice, Licence etc. (those with c) are nouns and Advise, Practise, License etc. are verbs.    One way of remembering this is that the word ‘ n oun’ comes before the word ‘ v erb’ in the dictionary; likewise ‘ c ’ comes before ‘ s ’, so the n ouns are ‘practi c e,licen c e,advi c e’ and the v erbs are ‘practi s e,licen s e,advi s e’. 39       H ere or H ear     We h ear with our ear .
