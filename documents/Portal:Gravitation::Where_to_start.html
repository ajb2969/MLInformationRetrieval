He used a <a class="uri" href="wood" title="wikilink">wood</a> <a href="Molding_(decorative)" title="wikilink">molding</a>, "12 cubits long, half a cubit wide and three finger-breadths thick" as a <a href="Inclined_plane" title="wikilink">ramp</a> with a straight, smooth, polished <a href="Groove_(engineering)" title="wikilink">groove</a> to study rolling balls ("a hard, smooth and very round bronze ball"). He lined the groove with "<a class="uri" href="parchment" title="wikilink">parchment</a>, also smooth and polished as possible". He inclined the ramp at various <a href="angle" title="wikilink">angles</a>, effectively slowing down the acceleration enough so that he could measure the elapsed time. He would let the ball roll a known distance down the ramp, and used a <a href="water_clock" title="wikilink">water clock</a> to measure the time taken to move the known distance; this clock was</p>
