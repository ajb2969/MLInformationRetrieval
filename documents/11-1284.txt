Hydroxyanthraquinone glucosyltransferase




Hydroxyanthraquinone glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, a hydroxyanthraquinone glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + an hydroxyanthraquinone 
 
 
 
  UDP + a glucosyloxyanthraquinone
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and hydroxyanthraquinone, whereas its two products are UDP and glucosyloxyanthraquinone.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:hydroxyanthraquinone O-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-anthraquinone glucosyltransferase, and anthraquinone-specific glucosyltransferase.
