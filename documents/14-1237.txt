Co-Büchi automaton

In automata theory, a co-Büchi automaton is a variant of Büchi automaton. The only difference is the accepting condition: a Co-Büchi automaton accepts an infinite word 
 
 
 
  if there exists a run, such that all the states occurring infinitely often in the run are in the final state set 
 
 
 
 . In contrast, a Büchi automaton accepts a word 
 
 
 
  if there exists a run, such that at least one state occurring infinitely often in the final state set 
 
 
 
 .
(Deterministic) Co-Büchi automata are strictly weaker than (nondeterministic) Büchi automata.
Formal definition
Formally, a deterministic co-Büchi automaton is a tuple 
 
 
 
  that consists of the following components:



 
  is a finite set. The elements of 
 
 
 
  are called the states of 
 
 
 
 .


 
  is a finite set called the alphabet of 
 
 
 
 .


 
  is the transition function of 
 
 
 
 .


 
  is an element of 
 
 
 
 , called the initial state.


 
  is the final state set. 
 
 
 
  accepts exactly those words 
 
 
 
  with the run 
 
 
 
 , in which all of the infinitely often occurring states in 
 
 
 
  are in 
 
 
 
 .

In a non-deterministic co-Büchi automaton, the transition function 
 
 
 
  is replaced with a transition relation 
 
 
 
 . The initial state 
 
 
 
  is replaced with an initial state set 
 
 
 
 . Generally, the term co-Büchi automaton refers to the non-deterministic co-Büchi Büchi automaton.

Acceptance Condition
The acceptance condition of a co-Büchi automaton is formally



The Büchi acceptance condition is the complement of the co-Büchi acceptance condition:



Properties
Co-Büchi automata are closed under union, intersection, projection and determinization.
