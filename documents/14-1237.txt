   Co-Büchi automaton      Co-Büchi automaton   In automata theory , a co-Büchi automaton is a variant of Büchi automaton . The only difference is the accepting condition: a Co-Büchi automaton accepts an infinite word   w   w   w   if there exists a run, such that all the states occurring infinitely often in the run are in the final state set   F   F   F   . In contrast, a Büchi automaton accepts a word   w   w   w   if there exists a run, such that at least one state occurring infinitely often in the final state set   F   F   F   .  (Deterministic) Co-Büchi automata are strictly weaker than (nondeterministic) Büchi automata.  Formal definition  Formally, a deterministic co-Büchi automaton is a tuple    𝒜  =   (  Q  ,  Σ  ,  δ  ,   q  0   ,  F  )       𝒜   Q  normal-Σ  δ   subscript  q  0   F     \mathcal{A}=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_{0},F)   that consists of the following components:      Q   Q   Q   is a finite set . The elements of   Q   Q   Q   are called the states of   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   .     Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   is a finite set called the alphabet of   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   .      δ  :    Q  ×  Σ   →  Q      normal-:  δ   normal-→    Q  normal-Σ   Q     \delta:Q\times\Sigma\rightarrow Q   is the transition function of   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   .      q  0     subscript  q  0    q_{0}   is an element of   Q   Q   Q   , called the initial state.      F  ⊆  Q      F  Q    F\subseteq Q   is the final state set .   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   accepts exactly those words   w   w   w   with the run    ρ   (  w  )       ρ  w    \rho(w)   , in which all of the infinitely often occurring states in    ρ   (  w  )       ρ  w    \rho(w)   are in   F   F   F   .   In a non-deterministic co-Büchi automaton , the transition function   δ   δ   \delta   is replaced with a transition relation   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   . The initial state    q  0     subscript  q  0    q_{0}   is replaced with an initial state set    Q  0     subscript  Q  0    Q_{0}   . Generally, the term co-Büchi automaton refers to the non-deterministic co-Büchi Büchi automaton.  For more comprehensive formalism see also ω-automaton .  Acceptance Condition  The acceptance condition of a co-Büchi automaton is formally        ∃   i   ∀  j     :    j  ≥  i     ρ   (   w  j   )    ∈  F     .     normal-:      i   for-all  j      formulae-sequence    j  i       ρ   subscript  w  j    F      \exists i\forall j:\;j\geq i\quad\rho(w_{j})\in F.     The Büchi acceptance condition is the complement of the co-Büchi acceptance condition:        ∀   i   ∃  j     :    j  ≥  i     ρ   (   w  j   )    ∈  F     .     normal-:   for-all    i    j      formulae-sequence    j  i       ρ   subscript  w  j    F      \forall i\exists j:\;j\geq i\quad\rho(w_{j})\in F.     Properties  Co-Büchi automata are closed under union, intersection, projection and determinization.  "  Category:Automata theory
