Radially unbounded function

In mathematics, a radially unbounded function is a function 
 
 
 
  for which 1



Such functions are applied in control theory and required in optimization for determination of compact spaces.
Notice that the norm used in the definition can be any norm defined on 
 
 
 
 , and that the behavior of the function along the axes does not necessarily reveal that it is radially unbounded or not; i.e. to be radially unbounded the condition must be verified along any path that results in:



For example the functions






are not radially unbounded since along the line 
 
 
 
 , the condition is not verified even though the second function is globally positive definite.
