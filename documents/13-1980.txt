   Radially unbounded function      Radially unbounded function   In mathematics, a radially unbounded function is a function    f  :    ℝ  n   →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  ℝ  n   ℝ     f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   for which 1        ∥  x  ∥   →  ∞  ⇒   f   (  x  )    →  ∞   .       normal-→   norm  x      normal-⇒      f  x     normal-→        \|x\|\to\infty\Rightarrow f(x)\to\infty.\,     Such functions are applied in control theory and required in optimization for determination of compact spaces .  Notice that the norm used in the definition can be any norm defined on    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   , and that the behavior of the function along the axes does not necessarily reveal that it is radially unbounded or not; i.e. to be radially unbounded the condition must be verified along any path that results in:       ∥  x  ∥   →   ∞      normal-→   norm  x      \|x\|\to\infty\,     For example the functions         f   1    (  x  )    =     (    x  1   -   x  2    )   2           subscript  f  1   x    superscript     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    2     \ f_{1}(x)=(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}\,            f   2    (  x  )    =     (    x  1  2   +   x  2  2    )   /   (   1  +   x  1  2   +   x  2  2    )    +     (    x  1   -   x  2    )   2            subscript  f  2   x          superscript   subscript  x  1   2    superscript   subscript  x  2   2      1   superscript   subscript  x  1   2    superscript   subscript  x  2   2      superscript     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    2      \ f_{2}(x)=(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2})/(1+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2})+(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}\,     are not radially unbounded since along the line     x  1   =   x  2        subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2     x_{1}=x_{2}   , the condition is not verified even though the second function is globally positive definite.
