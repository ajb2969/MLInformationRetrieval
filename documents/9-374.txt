   Tupper's self-referential formula      Tupper's self-referential formula   Tupper's self-referential formula is a formula defined by Jeff Tupper that, when graphed in two dimensions at a very specific location in the plane, can be "programmed" to visually reproduce the formula itself. It is used in various and computer science courses as an exercise in graphing formulae. Although it is colloquially known as a " self-referential formula", this is actually a misnomer, 1 because the image does not encode the constant K which is external data, and Tupper himself did not describe his formula that way. 2  The formula was first published in his 2001 SIGGRAPH paper that discusses methods related to the GrafEq formula-graphing program he developed.  The formula is an inequality defined by:        1  2   <   ⌊   mod   (    ⌊   y  17   ⌋    2    -   17   ⌊  x  ⌋     -   mod   (   ⌊  y  ⌋   ,  17  )       ,  2  )    ⌋    ,        1  2       mod         y  17     superscript  2        17    x       mod     y   17       2       {1\over 2}<\left\lfloor\mathrm{mod}\left(\left\lfloor{y\over 17}\right\rfloor 2%
 ^{-17\lfloor x\rfloor-\mathrm{mod}(\lfloor y\rfloor,17)},2\right)\right\rfloor,     where    ⌊  ⋅  ⌋      normal-⋅    \lfloor\cdot\rfloor   denotes the floor function , and   mod   mod   \mathrm{mod}   is the modulo operation .
