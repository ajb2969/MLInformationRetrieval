Tupper's self-referential formula

Tupper's self-referential formula is a formula defined by Jeff Tupper that, when graphed in two dimensions at a very specific location in the plane, can be "programmed" to visually reproduce the formula itself. It is used in various math and computer science courses as an exercise in graphing formulae. Although it is colloquially known as a "self-referential formula", this is actually a misnomer,1 because the image does not encode the constant K which is external data, and Tupper himself did not describe his formula that way.2
The formula was first published in his 2001 SIGGRAPH paper that discusses methods related to the GrafEq formula-graphing program he developed.
The formula is an inequality defined by:



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the floor function, and 
 
 
 
  is the modulo operation.
Let k equal the following 543-digit integer:
If one graphs the set of points (x, y) in 0 ≤ x
