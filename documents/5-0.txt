Conditional convergence

In mathematics, a series or integral is said to be conditionally convergent if it converges, but it does not converge absolutely.
Definition
More precisely, a series 
 
 
 
  is said to converge conditionally if 
 
 
 
  exists and is a finite number (not ∞ or −∞), but 
 
 

A classic example is given by



which converges to 
 
 
 
 , but is not absolutely convergent (see Harmonic series).
The simplest examples of conditionally convergent series (including the one above) are the alternating series.
Bernhard Riemann proved that a conditionally convergent series may be rearranged to converge to any sum at all, including ∞ or −∞; see Riemann series theorem.
A typical conditionally convergent integral is that on the non-negative real axis of 
 
 
 
  (see Fresnel integral).
