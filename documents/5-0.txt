   Conditional convergence      Conditional convergence   In mathematics , a series or integral is said to be conditionally convergent if it converges, but it does not converge absolutely .  Definition  More precisely, a series     ∑   n  =  0   ∞    a  n       superscript   subscript     n  0       subscript  a  n     \scriptstyle\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}   is said to converge conditionally if      lim   m  →  ∞        ∑   n  =  0   m     a  n        subscript    normal-→  m       superscript   subscript     n  0    m    subscript  a  n      \scriptstyle\lim\limits_{m\rightarrow\infty}\,\sum\limits_{n=0}^{m}\,a_{n}   exists and is a finite number (not ∞ or −∞), but       ∑   n  =  0   ∞    |   a  n   |    =  ∞   .        superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  a  n        \scriptstyle\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}\left|a_{n}\right|=\infty.     A classic example is given by           1  -   1  2    +   1  3    -   1  4    +   1  5    -  ⋯   =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞      (   -  1   )    n  +  1    n                  1    1  2      1  3      1  4      1  5    normal-⋯     superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript    1     n  1    n      1-{1\over 2}+{1\over 3}-{1\over 4}+{1\over 5}-\cdots=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty%
 }{(-1)^{n+1}\over n}     which converges to    ln   (  2  )       2    \ln(2)\,\!   , but is not absolutely convergent (see Harmonic series ).  The simplest examples of conditionally convergent series (including the one above) are the alternating series .  Bernhard Riemann proved that a conditionally convergent series may be rearranged to converge to any sum at all, including ∞ or −∞; see Riemann series theorem .  A typical conditionally convergent integral is that on the non-negative real axis of    sin   (   x  2   )        superscript  x  2     \sin(x^{2})   (see Fresnel integral ).
