2,4-diaminopentanoate dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a 2,4-diaminopentanoate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2,4-diaminopentanoate + H2O + NAD(P)+ 
 
 
 
  2-amino-4-oxopentanoate + NH3 + NAD(P)H + H+


The 4 substrates of this enzyme are 2,4-diaminopentanoate, H2O, NAD+, and NADP+, whereas its 5 products are 2-amino-4-oxopentanoate, NH3, NADH, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,4-diaminopentanoate:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase (deaminating). This enzyme is also called 2,4-diaminopentanoic acid C4 dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: lysine degradation, arginine and proline metabolism, and d-arginine and d-ornithine metabolism.
