On August 19, 2011, a ≥3.6 Earth-mass planet was discovered using HARPS that is "just inside" the habitable zone , along with the planets of 82 G. Eridani and HR 7722 c . 2 The planet could be potentially cool enough to host liquid water if the planet exhibits more than 50% cloud coverage. HD 85512 b is currently the fifth best candidate for habitability according to the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog .
