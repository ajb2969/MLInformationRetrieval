   RANDU      RANDU   (Figure)  Three-dimensional plot of 100,000 values generated with RANDU. Each point represents 3 consecutive pseudorandom values. It is clearly seen that the points fall in 15 two-dimensional  planes .   RANDU is a linear congruential  pseudorandom number generator of the Park–Miller type , which has been used since the 1960s. 1 It is defined by the recurrence :       V   j  +  1    =    65539  ⋅    V  j     mod    2  31          subscript  V    j  1     modulo   normal-⋅  65539   subscript  V  j     superscript  2  31      V_{j+1}=65539\cdot V_{j}\,\bmod\,2^{31}\,     with the initial seed number,    V  0     subscript  V  0    \scriptstyle V_{0}   as an odd number . It generates pseudorandom integers     V  j     subscript  V  j    \scriptstyle V_{j}   which are uniformly distributed in the interval , but in practical applications are often mapped into pseudorandom rationals     X  j     subscript  X  j    \scriptstyle X_{j}   in the interval , by the formula:       X  j   =    V  j    2  31         subscript  X  j      subscript  V  j    superscript  2  31      X_{j}=\frac{V_{j}}{2^{31}}   .  It is widely considered to be one of the most ill-conceived random number generators ever designed. It fails the spectral test badly for dimensions greater than 2, and every integer result is odd. However, at least eight low-order bits are dropped when converted to single-precision floating-point.  The reason for choosing these particular values is that with a 32-bit-integer word size, the arithmetic of mod 2 31 and   65539   65539   65539       (    i.e.,   2  16    +  3   )        i.e.,   superscript  2  16    3    (\text{i.e., }2^{16}+3)   calculations could be done quickly, using special features of some computer hardware.  Problems with multiplier and modulus  To show the problem with these values, of multiplier 65539 and modulus 2 31 , consider the following calculation where every term should be taken mod 2 31 . Start by writing the recursive relation as:       x   k  +  2    =    (    2  16   +  3   )    x   k  +  1     =     (    2  16   +  3   )   2     x  k            subscript  x    k  2         superscript  2  16   3    subscript  x    k  1             superscript     superscript  2  16   3   2    subscript  x  k       x_{k+2}=(2^{16}+3)x_{k+1}=(2^{16}+3)^{2}x_{k}\,     which becomes, after expanding the quadratic factor:       x   k  +  2    =    (    2  32   +   6  ⋅   2  16    +  9   )    x  k    =    [    6  ⋅   (    2  16   +  3   )    -  9   ]     x  k            subscript  x    k  2         superscript  2  32    normal-⋅  6   superscript  2  16    9    subscript  x  k            delimited-[]     normal-⋅  6     superscript  2  16   3    9     subscript  x  k       x_{k+2}=(2^{32}+6\cdot 2^{16}+9)x_{k}=[6\cdot(2^{16}+3)-9]x_{k}\,      because 0}}    and allows us to show the correlation between three points as:       x   k  +  2    =    6   x   k  +  1     -   9    x  k           subscript  x    k  2        6   subscript  x    k  1       9   subscript  x  k       x_{k+2}=6x_{k+1}-9x_{k}\,     As a result of this correlation, the points in three-dimensional space (mod 2 31 ) fall in 15 planes. 2 As a result of the wide use of RANDU in the early 1970s, many results from that time are seen as suspicious. 3  This misbehavior was already detected in 1963 4 on a 36-bit computer, and carefully reimplemented on the 32-bit IBM System/360.
