Each member of this infinite family of uniform polyhedron compounds is a symmetric arrangement of antiprisms sharing a common axis of rotational symmetry.  Infinite family  This infinite family can be enumerated as follows:   For each positive integer n ≥1 and for each rational number p / q >3/2 (expressed with p and q  coprime ), there occurs the compound of n  p / q -gonal antiprisms, with symmetry group:  D np d if nq is odd  D np h if nq is even    Where p / q =2, the component is the tetrahedron (or dyadic antiprism). In this case, if n =2 then the compound is the stella octangula , with higher symmetry ( O h ).  Compounds of two antiprisms  Compounds of two n -antiprisms share their vertices with a 2 n - prism , and exist as two alternated set of vertices.  Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a antiprism with n -gonal bases and isosceles triangles are       (   cos    k  π   n    ,   sin    k  π   n    ,     (   -  1   )   k   h   )           k  π   n          k  π   n       superscript    1   k   h     \left(\cos\frac{k\pi}{n},\sin\frac{k\pi}{n},(-1)^{k}h\right)         (   cos    k  π   n    ,   sin    k  π   n    ,     (   -  1   )    k  +  1    h   )           k  π   n          k  π   n       superscript    1     k  1    h     \left(\cos\frac{k\pi}{n},\sin\frac{k\pi}{n},(-1)^{k+1}h\right)      with k ranging from 0 to 2 n −1; if the triangles are equilateral,        2   h  2    =    cos   π  n    -   cos    2  π   n      .        2   superscript  h  2          π  n          2  π   n       2h^{2}=\cos\frac{\pi}{n}-\cos\frac{2\pi}{n}.
