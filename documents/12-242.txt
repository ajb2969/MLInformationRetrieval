Landau–Lifshitz model

In solid-state physics, the Landau–Lifshitz equation (LLE), named for Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, is a partial differential equation describing time evolution of magnetism in solids, depending on 1 time variable and 1, 2, or 3 space variables.
Landau–Lifshitz equation
The LLE describes an anisotropic magnet. The equation is described in  as follows: It is an equation for a vector field S, in other words a function on R1+n taking values in R3. The equation depends on a fixed symmetric 3 by 3 matrix J, usually assumed to be diagonal; that is, 
 
 
 
 . It is given by Hamilton's equation of motion for the Hamiltonian



(where J(S) is the quadratic form of J applied to the vector S) which is



In 1+1 dimensions this equation is



In 2+1 dimensions this equation takes the form



which is the (2+1)-dimensional LLE. For the (3+1)-dimensional case LLE looks like



Integrable reductions
In general case LLE (2) is nonintegrable. But it admits the two integrable reductions:

a) in the 1+1 dimensions, that is Eq. (3), it is integrable
 
b) when 
 
 
 
 . In this case the (1+1)-dimensional LLE (3) turns into the continuous classical Heisenberg ferromagnet equation (see e.g. Heisenberg model (classical)) which is already integrable.
