Mannitol 2-dehydrogenase (NADP+)

  In enzymology, a mannitol 2-dehydrogenase (NADP+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-mannitol + NADP+

 
  D-fructose + NADPH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-mannitol and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are D-fructose, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-mannitol:NADP+ 2-oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called mannitol 2-dehydrogenase (NADP+). This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
