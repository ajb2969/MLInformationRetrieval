   Samuelson's inequality      Samuelson's inequality   In statistics , Samuelson's inequality , named after the economist Paul Samuelson , 1 also called the Laguerre–Samuelson inequality , 2 after the mathematician Edmond Laguerre , states that every one of any collection x 1 , ..., x n , is within √( n − 1) sample standard deviations of their sample mean.

Samuelson's inequality may be considered a reason why studentization of residuals should be done externally .  Relationship to polynomials  Samuelson was not the first to describe this relationship. The first to discover this relationship was probably Laguerre in 1880 while investigating the roots (zeros) of polynomials . 4 5  Consider a polynomial with all roots real:         a  0    x  n    +    a  1    x   n  -  1     +  ⋯  +    a   n  -  1    x   +   a  n    =  0           subscript  a  0    superscript  x  n       subscript  a  1    superscript  x    n  1     normal-⋯     subscript  a    n  1    x    subscript  a  n    0    a_{0}x^{n}+a_{1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}x+a_{n}=0     Without loss of generality let     a  0   =  1       subscript  a  0   1    a_{0}=1   and let       t  1   =   ∑   x  i         subscript  t  1      subscript  x  i      t_{1}=\sum x_{i}   and     t  2   =   ∑   x  i  2         subscript  t  2      superscript   subscript  x  i   2      t_{2}=\sum x_{i}^{2}     Then       a  1   =   -   ∑   x  i     =   -   t  1           subscript  a  1        subscript  x  i             subscript  t  1       a_{1}=-\sum x_{i}=-t_{1}     and        a  2   =   ∑    x  i    x  j     =     t  1  2   -   t  2    2      where  i   <  j      formulae-sequence       subscript  a  2        subscript  x  i    subscript  x  j               superscript   subscript  t  1   2    subscript  t  2    2         where  i   j     a_{2}=\sum x_{i}x_{j}=\frac{t_{1}^{2}-t_{2}}{2}\qquad\text{ where }i     In terms of the coefficients       t  2   =    a  1  2   -   2   a  2          subscript  t  2      superscript   subscript  a  1   2     2   subscript  a  2       t_{2}=a_{1}^{2}-2a_{2}     Laguerre showed that the roots of this polynomial were bounded by       -    a  1   /  n    ±   b    n  -  1        plus-or-minus       subscript  a  1   n      b      n  1       -a_{1}/n\pm b\sqrt{n-1}     where      b  =      n   t  2    -   t  1     n   =       n   a  1  2    +   a  1    -   2  n   a  2      n         b          n   subscript  t  2     subscript  t  1     n                  n   superscript   subscript  a  1   2     subscript  a  1      2  n   subscript  a  2      n      b=\frac{\sqrt{nt_{2}-t_{1}}}{n}=\frac{\sqrt{na_{1}^{2}+a_{1}-2na_{2}}}{n}     Inspection shows that    -    a  1   n          subscript  a  1   n     -\tfrac{a_{1}}{n}   is the mean of the roots and that b is the standard deviation of the roots.  Laguerre failed to notice this relationship with the means and standard deviations of the roots being more interested in the bounds themselves. This relationship permits a rapid estimate of the bounds of the roots and may be of use in their location.  Note  When the coefficients    a  1     subscript  a  1    a_{1}   and    a  2     subscript  a  2    a_{2}   are both zero no information can be obtained about the location of the roots, because not all roots are real (as can be seen from Descartes' rule of signs ) unless the constant term is also zero.
