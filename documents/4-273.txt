   Cohomotopy group      Cohomotopy group   In mathematics , particularly algebraic topology , cohomotopy sets are particular contravariant functors from the category of pointed topological spaces and point-preserving continuous maps to the category of sets and functions . They are dual to the homotopy groups , but less studied.  The p -th cohomotopy set of a pointed topological space  X is defined by   π p ( X ) = [ X , S p ]   the set of pointed homotopy classes of continuous mappings from X to the p - sphere  S p . For p=1 this set has an abelian group structure, and, provided X is a CW-complex , is isomorphic to the first cohomology group H 1 (X) , since S 1 is a K ( Z ,1) . In fact, it is a theorem of Hopf that if X is a CW-complex of dimension at most n , then [ X , S p ] is in bijection with the p -th cohomology group H p (X) .  The set also has a group structure if X is a suspension     Σ  Y      normal-Σ  Y    \Sigma Y   , such as a sphere S q for q    ≥     \geq   1.  If X is not a CW-complex , H 1 (X) might not be isomorphic to [ X , S 1 ]. A counterexample is given by the Warsaw circle , whose first cohomology group vanishes, but admits a map to S 1 which is not homotopic to a constant map 1  Properties  Some basic facts about cohomotopy sets, some more obvious than others:   π p ( S q ) = π q ( S p ) for all p , q .    For q = p + 1 or p + 2 ≥ 4, π p ( S q ) = Z 2 . (To prove this result, Pontrjagin developed the concept of framed cobordisms .)    If f , g : X → S p has || f ( x ) - g ( x )|| < 2 for all x , [ f ] = [ g ], and the homotopy is smooth if f and g are.    For X a compact smooth manifold, π p ( X ) is isomorphic to the set of homotopy classes of smooth maps X → S p ; in this case, every continuous map can be uniformly approximated by a smooth map and any homotopic smooth maps will be smoothly homotopic.    If X is an m - manifold , π p ( X ) = 0 for p > m .    If X is an m - manifold with boundary, π p ( X ,∂ X ) is canonically in bijection with the set of cobordism classes of codimension - p framed submanifolds of the interior  X -∂ X .    The stable cohomotopy group of X is the colimit         π  s  p    (  X  )    =     lim  →   k    [    Σ  k   X   ,   S   p  +  k    ]           subscript   superscript  π  p   s   X     subscript  injective-limit  k       superscript  normal-Σ  k   X    superscript  S    p  k        \pi^{p}_{s}(X)=\underrightarrow{\lim}_{k}{[\Sigma^{k}X,S^{p+k}]}      which is an abelian group .
