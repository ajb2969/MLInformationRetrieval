   L-aspartate oxidase      L-aspartate oxidase   In enzymology , a L-aspartate oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-aspartate + H 2 O + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxaloacetate + NH 3 + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-aspartate , H 2 O , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are oxaloacetate , NH 3 , and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-aspartate:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating) . This enzyme participates in alanine and aspartate metabolism and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism . It employs one cofactor , FAD .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
