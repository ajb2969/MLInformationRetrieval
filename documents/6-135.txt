De Polignac's formula

In number theory, de Polignac's formula, named after Alphonse de Polignac, gives the prime decomposition of the factorial n!, where n ≥ 1 is an integer. L. E. Dickson attributes the formula to Legendre.1
The formula
Let n ≥ 1 be an integer. The prime decomposition of n! is given by



where



and the brackets represent the floor function. Note that the former product can equally well be taken only over primes less than or equal to n, and the latter sum can equally well be taken for j ranging from 1 to logp(n), i.e :



Note that, for any real number x, and any integer n, we have:



which allows one to more easily compute the terms sp(n).
The small disadvantage of the De Polignac's formula is that we need to know all the primes up to n. In fact,



where 
 
 
 
  is a prime-counting function counting the number of prime numbers less than or equal to n
