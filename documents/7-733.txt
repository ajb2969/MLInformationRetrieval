   Chebyshev equation      Chebyshev equation   Chebyshev's equation is the second order linear differential equation          (   1  -   x  2    )      d  2   y    d   x  2      -   x    d  y    d  x      +    p  2   y    =  0              1   superscript  x  2         superscript  d  2   y     d   superscript  x  2        x      d  y     d  x         superscript  p  2   y    0    (1-x^{2}){d^{2}y\over dx^{2}}-x{dy\over dx}+p^{2}y=0     where p is a real constant. The equation is named after Russian mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev .  The solutions are obtained by power series :      y  =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     a  n    x  n         y    superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  a  n    superscript  x  n       y=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}x^{n}     where the coefficients obey the recurrence relation        a   n  +  2    =      (   n  -  p   )    (   n  +  p   )      (   n  +  1   )    (   n  +  2   )      a  n     .       subscript  a    n  2            n  p     n  p        n  1     n  2      subscript  a  n      a_{n+2}={(n-p)(n+p)\over(n+1)(n+2)}a_{n}.     These series converge for x in    [   -  1   ,  1  ]       1   1    [-1,1]   , as may be seen by applying the ratio test to the recurrence.  The recurrence may be started with arbitrary values of a 0 and a 1 , leading to the two-dimensional space of solutions that arises from second order differential equations. The standard choices are:   a 0 = 1 ; a 1 = 0, leading to the solution       F   (  x  )    =      1  -     p  2    2  !     x  2     +      (   p  -  2   )    p  2    (   p  +  2   )     4  !     x  4     -      (   p  -  4   )    (   p  -  2   )    p  2    (   p  +  2   )    (   p  +  4   )     6  !     x  6     +  ⋯         F  x           1       superscript  p  2     2     superscript  x  2             p  2    superscript  p  2     p  2      4     superscript  x  4             p  4     p  2    superscript  p  2     p  2     p  4      6     superscript  x  6     normal-⋯     F(x)=1-\frac{p^{2}}{2!}x^{2}+\frac{(p-2)p^{2}(p+2)}{4!}x^{4}-\frac{(p-4)(p-2)p%
 ^{2}(p+2)(p+4)}{6!}x^{6}+\cdots      and   a 0 = 0 ; a 1 = 1, leading to the solution        G   (  x  )    =     x  -      (   p  -  1   )    (   p  +  1   )     3  !     x  3     +      (   p  -  3   )    (   p  -  1   )    (   p  +  1   )    (   p  +  3   )     5  !     x  5     -  ⋯    .        G  x         x          p  1     p  1      3     superscript  x  3             p  3     p  1     p  1     p  3      5     superscript  x  5     normal-⋯     G(x)=x-\frac{(p-1)(p+1)}{3!}x^{3}+\frac{(p-3)(p-1)(p+1)(p+3)}{5!}x^{5}-\cdots.      The general solution is any linear combination of these two.  When p is an integer, one or the other of the two functions has its series terminate after a finite number of terms: F terminates if p is even, and G terminates if p is odd. In this case, that function is a p th degree polynomial (converging everywhere, of course), and that polynomial is proportional to the p th  Chebyshev polynomial .        T  p    (  x  )    =      (   -  1   )    p  /  2     F   (  x  )           subscript  T  p   x      superscript    1     p  2    F  x     T_{p}(x)=(-1)^{p/2}\ F(x)\,   if p is even        T  p    (  x  )    =      (   -  1   )     (   p  -  1   )   /  2      p   G   (  x  )           subscript  T  p   x      superscript    1       p  1   2    p  G  x     T_{p}(x)=(-1)^{(p-1)/2}\ p\ G(x)\,   if p is odd  "  Category:Ordinary differential equations
