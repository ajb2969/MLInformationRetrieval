   Mex (mathematics)      Mex (mathematics)   In combinatorial game theory , the mex , or " m inimum ex cludant", of a set of ordinals denotes the smallest ordinal not contained in the set.  Some examples:       mex   (   {  1  ,  2  ,  3  }   )    =  0        mex   1  2  3    0    \mbox{mex}(\left\{1,2,3\right\})=0          mex   (   {  0  ,  1  ,  4  ,  7  ,  12  }   )    =  2        mex   0  1  4  7  12    2    \mbox{mex}(\left\{0,1,4,7,12\right\})=2          mex   (   {  0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  …  }   )    =  ω        mex   0  1  2  3  normal-…    ω    \mbox{mex}(\left\{0,1,2,3,\ldots\right\})=\omega          mex   (   {  0  ,  2  ,  4  ,  6  ,  …  }   )    =  1        mex   0  2  4  6  normal-…    1    \mbox{mex}(\left\{0,2,4,6,\ldots\right\})=1          mex   (   {  0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  …  ,  ω  }   )    =   ω  +  1         mex   0  1  2  3  normal-…  ω      ω  1     \mbox{mex}(\left\{0,1,2,3,\ldots,\omega\right\})=\omega+1     where ω is the limit ordinal for the natural numbers.  In the Sprague-Grundy theory the minimum excluded ordinal is used to determine the nimber of a normal-play impartial game, which is a game in which either player has the same moves in each position and the last player to move wins. The nimber is equal to 0 for a game that is lost immediately by the first player, and is equal to the mex of the nimbers of all possible next positions for any other game.  For example, in a one-pile version of Nim , the game starts with a pile of n stones, and the player to move may take any positive number of stones. If n is zero, the nimber is 0. If n is 1, the player to move will leave 0 stones, and the mex of { 0 }, 1, gives the nimber for this case. If n is 2, the player to move can leave 0 or 1 stones, giving 2 as the mex of { 0, 1 }. In general, the player to move with a pile of n stones can leave anywhere from 0 to n-1 stones; the mex of the numbers { 0, 1, ..., n -1 } is always n . From this we can conclude that the first player wins if n is not zero (by taking all the stones).  If we change the game so that the player to move can only take up to 3 stones, then when n =4, the successor states have nimbers { 1, 2, 3 }, giving a mex of 0. Now the first player loses; the second player's strategy is to respond to whatever move the first player makes by taking the rest of the stones. For n =5, the nimbers of the successor states 2, 3, and 4 are 2, 3, and 0 (as we just calculated); the mex of { 0, 2, 3 } is 1, so starting with 5 stones in this game is a win for the first player.
