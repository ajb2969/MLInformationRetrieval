   Certificate (complexity)      Certificate (complexity)   In computational complexity theory , a certificate (also called a witness ) is a string that certifies the answer to a computation, or certifies the membership of some string in a language. A certificate is often thought of as a solution path within a verification process, which is used to check whether a problem gives the answer "Yes" or "No".  In the decision tree model of computation, certificate complexity is the minimum number of the   n   n   n   input variables of a decision tree that need to be assigned a value in order to definitely establish the value of the Boolean function    f   f   f   .  Definition  Certificate is generally used to prove semi-decidability as following: 1  L ∈ SD iff there is a two-place predicate R ⊆ Σ∗ × Σ∗ such that R is computable, and such that for all x ∈ Σ∗:  x ∈ L ⇔ there exists y such that R(x, y)  and to prove NP as following:  L ∈ NP iff there is a polytime verifier V such that:  x ∈ L ⇔ there exists y such that |y| c and V accepts (x, y)  Example  L = { , x, w> | does accept x in |w| steps?}  Show L ∈ NP.   verifier:  gets string c = , x, w such that |c| 3 )  if we have a computation of a TM with k steps the total size of the computation string is k 2  Thus, , x, w> ∈ L ⇔ there exists c 3 such that , x, w, c> ∈ V ∈ P  See also   Witness (mathematics) , an analogous concept in mathematical logic   References    .
