   Incremental capital-output ratio      Incremental capital-output ratio   The Incremental Capital-Output Ratio (ICOR), is the ratio of investment to growth which is equal to 1 divided by the marginal product of capital . The higher the ICOR, the lower the productivity of capital or the marginal efficiency of capital . The ICOR can be thought of as a measure of the inefficiency with which capital is used. In most countries the ICOR is in the neighborhood of 3. It is a topic discussed in Economic growth .       incremental capital output ratio  =    Δ  K    Δ  Y    =     Δ  K   Y     Δ  Y   Y    =    I  Y     Δ  Y   Y          incremental capital output ratio      normal-Δ  K     normal-Δ  Y               normal-Δ  K   Y       normal-Δ  Y   Y             I  Y       normal-Δ  Y   Y       \text{incremental capital output ratio}=\frac{\Delta K}{\Delta Y}=\frac{\frac{%
 \Delta K}{Y}}{\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}}=\frac{\frac{I}{Y}}{\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}}      K: capital stock Y: output ( GDP ) I: net investment  According to this formula the incremental capital output ratio can be computed by dividing the investment share in GDP by the rate of growth of GDP.
