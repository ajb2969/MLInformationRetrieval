Josephus problem

In computer science and mathematics, the Josephus Problem (or Josephus permutation) is a theoretical problem related to a certain counting-out game.
There are people standing in a circle waiting to be executed. The counting out begins at some point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction. In each step, a certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed. The elimination proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed), until only the last person remains, who is given freedom.
The task is to choose the place in the initial circle so that you are the last one remaining and so survive.
History
The problem is named after Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian living in the 1st century. According to Josephus' account of the siege of Yodfat, he and his 40 soldiers were trapped in a cave, the exit of which was blocked by Romans. They chose suicide over capture and decided that they would form a circle and start killing themselves using a step of three. Josephus states that by luck or possibly by the hand of God, he and another man remained the last and gave up to the Romans.
The reference comes from Book 3, Chapter 8, par 7 of Josephus' The Jewish War (writing of himself in the third person):

Solution
In the following, 
 
 
 
  denotes the number of people in the initial circle, and 
 
 
 
  denotes the count for each step, that is, 
 
 
 
  people are skipped and the 
 
 
 
 -th is executed. The people in the circle are numbered from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .
===k=2=== We explicitly solve the problem when every 2nd person will be killed, i.e. 
 
 
 
 . (For the more general case 
 
 
 
 , we outline a solution below.) We express the solution recursively. Let 
 
 
 
  denote the position of the survivor when there are initially 
 
 
 
  people (and 
 
 
 
 ). The first time around the circle, all of the even-numbered people die. The second time around the circle, the new 2nd person dies, then the new 4th person, etc.; it's as though there were no first time around the circle.
If the initial number of people was even, then the person in position 
 
 
 
  during the second time around the circle was originally in position 
 
 
 
  (for every choice of 
 
 
 
 ). Let 
 
 
 
 . The person at 
 
 
 
  who will now survive was originally in position 
 
 
 
 . This gives us the recurrence



If the initial number of people was odd, then we think of person 1 as dying at the end of the first time around the circle. Again, during the second time around the circle, the new 2nd person dies, then the new 4th person, etc. In this case, the person in position 
 
 
 
  was originally in position 
 
 
 
 . This gives us the recurrence



When we tabulate the values of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  we see a pattern:

This suggests that 
 
 
 
  is an increasing odd sequence that restarts with 
 
 
 
  whenever the index n is a power of 2. Therefore, if we choose m and l so that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 . It is clear that values in the table satisfy this equation. Or we can think that after 
 
 
 
  people are dead there are only 
 
 
 
  people and we go to the 
 
 
 
 th person. He must be the survivor. So 
 
 
 
 . Below, we give a proof by induction.
Theorem: If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .
Proof: We use strong induction on 
 
 
 
 . The base case 
 
 
 
  is true. We consider separately the cases when 
 
 
 
  is even and when 
 
 
 
  is odd.
If 
 
 
 
  is even, then choose 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Note that 
 
 
 
 . We have 
 
 
 
 , where the second equality follows from the induction hypothesis.
If 
 
 
 
  is odd, then choose 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Note that 
 
 
 
 . We have 
 
 
 
 , where the second equality follows from the induction hypothesis. This completes the proof.
We can solve for 
 
 
 
  to get an explicit expression for 
 
 
 
 :



The most elegant form of the answer involves the binary representation of size 
 
 

 
  can be obtained by a one-bit left cyclic shift of 
 
 
 
  itself. If we represent 
 
 
 
  in binary as 
 
 
 
 , then the solution is given by 
 
 
 
 . The proof of this follows from the representation of 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
  or from the above expression for 
 
 
 
 .
The general case
The easiest way to solve this problem in the general case is to use dynamic programming by performing the first step and then using the solution of the remaining problem. When the index starts from one, then the person at 
 
 
 
  shifts from the first person is in position 
 
 
 
 , where n is the total number of persons. Let 
 
 
 
  denote the position of the survivor. After the 
 
 
 
 -th person is killed, we're left with a circle of 
 
 
 
 , and we start the next count with the person whose number in the original problem was 
 
 
 
 . The position of the survivor in the remaining circle would be 
 
 
 
  if we start counting at 
 
 
 
 ; shifting this to account for the fact that we're starting at 
 
 
 
  yields the recurrence



which takes the simpler form



if we number the positions from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  instead.
This approach has running time

 
 , but for small 
 
 
 
  and large 
 
 
 
  there is another approach. The second approach also uses dynamic programming but has running time 
 
 
 
 . It is based on considering killing k-th, 2k-th, ..., 
 
 
 
 -th people as one step, then changing the numbering.
Variants and generalizations
Josephus had an accomplice; the problem was then to find the places of the two last remaining survivors (whose conspiracy would ensure their survival). It is alleged that he placed himself and the other man in the 31st and 16th place respectively.1 A generalization of this process is as follows. We suppose that every 
 
 
 
 th person will be executed from a group of size 
 
 
 
 , in which the 
 
 
 
 th person is the survivor. If there is an addition of 
 
 
 
  people to the circle, then the survivor is in the 
 
 
 
 th position if there is less than or equal to 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is the lowest value in which 
 
 
 
 , then the survivor is in position 
 
 
 
 .2
Extended Josephus problem
Problem definition: There are n persons, numbered 1 to n, around a circle. We eliminate second of every two remaining persons until one person remains. Given the n, determine the number of xth person who is eliminated.3
