2-Methoxy-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinol methylase

2-Methoxy-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinol methylase (, ubiE (gene)) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:2-methoxy-6-all-trans-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinol 5-C-methyltransferase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 2-methoxy-6-all-trans-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinol 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 6-methoxy-3-methyl-2-all-trans-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinol
 

This enzyme is involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis.
