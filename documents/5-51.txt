Block LU decomposition

In linear algebra, a Block LU decomposition is a matrix decomposition of a block matrix into a lower block triangular matrix L and an upper block triangular matrix U. This decomposition is used in numerical analysis to reduce the complexity of the block matrix formula.
Block LDU decomposition



Block Cholesky decomposition
Consider a block matrix:


 
  where the matrix 
 
 
 
  is assumed to be non-singular, 
 
 
 
  is an identity matrix with proper dimension, and 
 
 
 
  is a matrix whose elements are all zero.
We can also rewrite the above equation using the half matrices:


 
  where the Schur complement of 
 
 
 
  in the block matrix is defined by


 
  and the half matrices can be calculated by means of Cholesky decomposition or LDL decomposition. The half matrices satisfy that



Thus, we have


 
  where



The matrix 
 
 
 
  can be decomposed in an algebraic manner into






\begin{pmatrix} A^{\frac{1}{2}} & 0 \\ C A^{-\frac{*}{2}} & Q^{\frac{1}{2}} \end{pmatrix} \mathrm{~~and~~} U = \begin{pmatrix} A^{\frac{*}{2}} & A^{-\frac{1}{2}}B \\ 0 & Q^{\frac{*}{2}} \end{pmatrix}.
