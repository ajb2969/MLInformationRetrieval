   Regular modal logic      Regular modal logic   In modal logic , a regular modal logic L is a modal logic closed under the duality of the modal operators:       ◇  A   ≡   ¬  □  ¬  A         normal-◇  A      normal-□   A     \Diamond A\equiv\lnot\Box\lnot A     and the rule         (   A  ∧  B   )   →  C   ⊢    (    □  A   ∧   □  B    )   →   □  C     .     proves   normal-→    A  B   C    normal-→      normal-□  A     normal-□  B      normal-□  C      (A\land B)\to C\vdash(\Box A\land\Box B)\to\Box C.     Every regular modal logic is classical , and every normal modal logic is regular and hence classical.  References  Chellas, Brian. Modal Logic: An Introduction . Cambridge University Press, 1980.
