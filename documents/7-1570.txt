   Brauer's theorem on forms      Brauer's theorem on forms    There also is Brauer's theorem on induced characters .    In mathematics , Brauer's theorem , named for Richard Brauer , is a result on the representability of 0 by forms over certain fields in sufficiently many variables. 1  Statement of Brauer's theorem  Let K be a field such that for every integer r > 0 there exists an integer ψ( r ) such that for n ≥ ψ(r) every equation         (  *  )      a  1    x  1  r    +  ⋯  +    a  n    x  n  r      =  0   ,     a  i   ∈  K   ,   i  =   1  ,  …  ,  n        formulae-sequence           subscript  a  1    superscript   subscript  x  1   r    normal-⋯     subscript  a  n    superscript   subscript  x  n   r      0    formulae-sequence     subscript  a  i   K     i   1  normal-…  n       (*)\qquad a_{1}x_{1}^{r}+\cdots+a_{n}x_{n}^{r}=0,\quad a_{i}\in K,\quad i=1,%
 \ldots,n     has a non-trivial (i.e. not all x i are equal to 0) solution in K . Then, given homogeneous polynomials f 1 ,..., f k of degrees r 1 ,..., r k respectively with coefficients in K , for every set of positive integers r 1 ,..., r k and every non-negative integer l , there exists a number ω( r 1 ,..., r k , l ) such that for n ≥ ω( r 1 ,..., r k , l ) there exists an l -dimensional affine subspace  M of K n (regarded as a vector space over K ) satisfying          f  1    (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =  ⋯  =    f  k    (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =  0   ,    ∀   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    ∈  M    .     formulae-sequence         subscript  f  1     subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n     normal-⋯          subscript  f  k     subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n          0       for-all    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n     M     f_{1}(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})=\cdots=f_{k}(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})=0,\quad\forall(x_{1%
 },\ldots,x_{n})\in M.     An application to the field of p-adic numbers  Letting K be the field of p-adic numbers in the theorem, the equation (*) is satisfied, since     ℚ  p  *   /    (   ℚ  p  *   )   b        superscript   subscript  ℚ  p      superscript   superscript   subscript  ℚ  p     b     \mathbb{Q}_{p}^{*}/\left(\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{*}\right)^{b}   , b a natural number, is finite. Choosing k = 1, one obtains the following corollary:   A homogeneous equation f ( x 1 ,..., x n ) = 0 of degree r in the field of p-adic numbers has a non-trivial solution if n is sufficiently large.   One can show that if n is sufficiently large according to the above corollary, then n is greater than r 2 . Indeed, Emil Artin conjectured 2 that every homogeneous polynomial of degree r over Q p in more than r 2 variables represents 0. This is obviously true for r = 1, and it is well known that the conjecture is true for r = 2 (see, for example, J.-P. Serre, A Course in Arithmetic , Chapter IV, Theorem 6). See quasi-algebraic closure for further context.  In 1950 Demyanov 3 verified the conjecture for r = 3 and p ≠ 3, and in 1952 D. J. Lewis 4 independently proved the case r = 3 for all primes p . But in 1966 Guy Terjanian constructed a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4 over Q 2 in 18 variables that has no non-trivial zero. 5 On the other hand, the Ax–Kochen theorem shows that for any fixed degree Artin's conjecture is true for all but finitely many Q p .
