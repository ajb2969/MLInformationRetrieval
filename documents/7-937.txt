   Big Omega function      Big Omega function   The notation    Ω   (   )       normal-Ω     \Omega(\text{ })\,\!   has at least three meanings in mathematics:       f  =   Ω   (  g  )        f    normal-Ω  g     f=\Omega(g)\,\!   means that the function   f   f   f\,\!   dominates   g   g   g\,\!   in some limit, see Big O notation . In this context   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is referred to as a lower bound.      Ω   (  n  )       normal-Ω  n    \Omega(n)\,\!   is the total number of prime factors of   n   n   n\,\!   , counting prime factors with multiplicity      Ω   (  x  )       normal-Ω  x    \Omega(x)\,\!   may refer to the Omega function, the inverse of    y  =   x  ⋅   e  x        y   normal-⋅  x   superscript  e  x      y=x\cdot e^{x}\,\!   , also known as the Lambert W function denoted    W   (  x  )       W  x    W(x)\,\!   .      ω   (  x  )       ω  x    \omega(x)\,\!   , related to the Lambert W Function, is called the Wright Omega Function    "
