   Picard–Lefschetz theory      Picard–Lefschetz theory   In mathematics, Picard–Lefschetz theory studies the topology of a complex manifold by looking at the critical points of a holomorphic function on the manifold. It was introduced by Émile Picard for complex surfaces in his book , and extended to higher dimensions by . It is a complex analog of Morse theory that studies the topology of a real manifold by looking at the critical points of a real function.  extended Picard–Lefschetz theory to varieties over more general fields, and Deligne used this generalization in his proof of the Weil conjectures .  Picard–Lefschetz formula  The Picard–Lefschetz formula describes the monodromy at a critical point.  Suppose that f is a holomorphic map from an (k+1) -dimensional projective complex manifold to the projective line P 1 . Also suppose that all critical points are non-degenerate and lie in different fibers, and have images x 1 ,..., x n in P 1 . Pick any other point x in P 1 . The fundamental group π 1 ( P 1 – { x 1 , ..., x n }, x ) is generated by loops w i going around the points x i , and to each point x i there is a vanishing cycle in the homology H k ( Y x ) of the fiber at x . Note that this is the middle homology since the fibre has complex dimension k , hence real dimension 2k . The monodromy action of π 1 ( P 1 – { x 1 , ..., x n }, x ) on H k ( Y x ) is described as follows by the Picard–Lefschetz formula. (The action of monodromy on other homology groups is trivial.) The monodromy action of a generator w i of the fundamental group on    γ   γ   \gamma    ∈ H k ( Y x ) is given by        w  i    (  γ  )    =   γ  +     (   -  1   )      (   k  +  1   )    (   k  +  2   )    /  2     ⟨  γ  ,   δ  i   ⟩    δ  i            subscript  w  i   γ     γ     superscript    1         k  1     k  2    2     γ   subscript  δ  i     subscript  δ  i       w_{i}(\gamma)=\gamma+(-1)^{(k+1)(k+2)/2}\langle\gamma,\delta_{i}\rangle\delta_%
