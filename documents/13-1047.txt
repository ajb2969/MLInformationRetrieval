   Scale-free ideal gas      Scale-free ideal gas   The scale-free ideal gas (SFIG) is a physical model assuming a collection of non-interacting elements with an stochastic proportional growth. It is the scale-invariant version of an ideal gas . Some cases of city-population, electoral results and cites to scientific journals can be approximately considered scale-free ideal gases. 1  In a one-dimensional discrete model with size-parameter k , where k 1 and k M are the minimum and maximum allowed sizes respectively, and v = dk / dt is the growth, the bulk probability density function  F ( k , v ) of a scale-free ideal gas follows        F   (  k  ,  v  )    =    N   Ω   k  2       exp   [   -      (    v  /  k   -   w  ¯    )   2   /  2    σ  w  2     ]       2  π     σ  w       ,        F   k  v        N    normal-Ω   superscript  k  2                superscript      v  k    normal-¯  w    2   2    superscript   subscript  σ  w   2            2  π     subscript  σ  w        F(k,v)=\frac{N}{\Omega k^{2}}\frac{\exp\left[-(v/k-\overline{w})^{2}/2\sigma_{%
 w}^{2}\right]}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_{w}},     where N is the total number of elements, Ω = ln k 1 / k M is the logaritmic "volume" of the system,     w  ¯   =   ⟨   v  /  k   ⟩        normal-¯  w    delimited-⟨⟩    v  k      \overline{w}=\langle v/k\rangle   is the mean relative growth and    σ  w     subscript  σ  w    \sigma_{w}   is the standard deviation of the relative growth. The entropy equation of state is       S  =   N  κ   {    ln    Ω  N       2  π     σ  w     H  ′      +   3  2    }     ,      S    N  κ           normal-Ω  N           2  π     subscript  σ  w     superscript  H  normal-′        3  2        S=N\kappa\left\{\ln\frac{\Omega}{N}\frac{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_{w}}{H^{\prime}}+%
 \frac{3}{2}\right\},     where   κ   κ   \kappa   is a constant that accounts for dimensionality and     H  ′   =    1  /  M   Δ  τ        superscript  H  normal-′       1  M   normal-Δ  τ     H^{\prime}=1/M\Delta\tau   is the elementary volume in phase space, with    Δ  τ      normal-Δ  τ    \Delta\tau   the elementary time and M the total number of allowed discrete sizes. This expression has the same form as the one-dimensional ideal gas, changing the thermodynamical variables ( N , V , T ) by ( N , Ω, σ w ).  Zipf's law may emerge in the external limits of the density since it is a special regime of scale-free ideal gases. 2  References  "  Category:Information theory  Category:Thermodynamics  Category:Scale-invariant systems     ↩  ↩
