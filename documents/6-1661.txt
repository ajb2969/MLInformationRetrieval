   Entropy of vaporization      Entropy of vaporization   The entropy of vaporization is the increase in entropy upon vaporization of a liquid. This is always positive since the degree of disorder increases in the transition from a liquid in a relatively small volume to a vapor or gas occupying a much larger space. At standard pressure P o = 1 bar , the value is denoted as Δ S o vap and normally expressed in J  mol −1  K −1 .  In a phase transition such as vaporization, both phases coexist in equilibrium, so the difference in Gibbs free energy is equal to zero.       Δ   G   v  a  p     =    Δ   H   v  a  p     -     T   v  a  p    ×  Δ    S   v  a  p      =  0          normal-Δ   subscript  G    v  a  p         normal-Δ   subscript  H    v  a  p          subscript  T    v  a  p    normal-Δ    subscript  S    v  a  p           0     \Delta G_{vap}=\Delta H_{vap}-T_{vap}\times\Delta S_{vap}=0   ,  where    Δ   H   v  a  p        normal-Δ   subscript  H    v  a  p      \Delta H_{vap}   is the heat or enthalpy of vaporization . Since this is a thermodynamic equation, the symbol T refers to the absolute thermodynamic temperature , measured in Kelvin (K). The entropy of vaporization is then equal to the heat of vaporization divided by the boiling point.       Δ   S   v  a  p     =    Δ   H   v  a  p      T   v  a  p           normal-Δ   subscript  S    v  a  p         normal-Δ   subscript  H    v  a  p      subscript  T    v  a  p       \Delta S_{vap}=\frac{\Delta H_{vap}}{T_{vap}}     According to Trouton's rule , the entropy of vaporization (at standard pressure) of most liquids is about 85 to 88 J mol −1 K −1 .
