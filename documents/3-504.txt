   Group algebra      Group algebra   In mathematics , the group algebra is any of various constructions to assign to a locally compact group an operator algebra (or more generally a Banach algebra ), such that representations of the algebra are related to representations of the group. As such, they are similar to the group ring associated to a discrete group.  Group algebras of topological groups: C c ( G )  For the purposes of functional analysis , and in particular of harmonic analysis , one wishes to carry over the group ring construction to topological groups  G . In case G is a locally compact Hausdorff group , G carries an essentially unique left-invariant countably additive Borel measure Œº called a Haar measure . Using the Haar measure, one can define a convolution operation on the space C c ( G ) of complex-valued continuous functions on G with compact support ; C c ( G ) can then be given any of various norms and the completion will be a group algebra.  To define the convolution operation, let f and g be two functions in C c ( G ). For t in G , define         [   f  *  g   ]    (  t  )    =    ‚à´  G    f   (  s  )   g   (    s   -  1    t   )   d  Œº   (  s  )      .         delimited-[]    f  g    t     subscript   G     f  s  g     superscript  s    1    t   d  Œº  s      [f*g](t)=\int_{G}f(s)g\left(s^{-1}t\right)\,d\mu(s).     The fact that f * g is continuous is immediate from the dominated convergence theorem . Also       Support   (   f  *  g   )    ‚äÜ    Support   (  f  )    ‚ãÖ   Support   (  g  )          Support    f  g     normal-‚ãÖ   Support  f    Support  g      \operatorname{Support}(f*g)\subseteq\operatorname{Support}(f)\cdot%
 \operatorname{Support}(g)     were the dot stands for the product in G . C c ( G ) also has a natural involution defined by:        f  *    (  s  )    =     f   (   s   -  1    )    ¬Ø   Œî   (   s   -  1    )           superscript  f    s      normal-¬Ø    f   superscript  s    1      normal-Œî   superscript  s    1       f^{*}(s)=\overline{f(s^{-1})}\Delta(s^{-1})     where Œî is the modular function on G . With this involution, it is a *-algebra .   Theorem. With the norm:         ‚à•  f  ‚à•   1   :=    ‚à´  G     |   f   (  s  )    |   d  Œº   (  s  )      ,     assign   subscript   norm  f   1     subscript   G         f  s    d  Œº  s      \|f\|_{1}:=\int_{G}|f(s)|d\mu(s),     C c ( G ) becomes an involutive normed algebra with an approximate identity .   The approximate identity can be indexed on a neighborhood basis of the identity consisting of compact sets. Indeed if V is a compact neighborhood of the identity, let f V be a non-negative continuous function supported in V such that        ‚à´  V     f  V    (  g  )   d  Œº   (  g  )     =  1.        subscript   V      subscript  f  V   g  d  Œº  g    1.    \int_{V}f_{V}(g)\,d\mu(g)=1.     Then { f V } V is an approximate identity. A group algebra has an identity, as opposed to just an approximate identity, if and only if the topology on the group is the discrete topology .  Note that for discrete groups, C c ( G ) is the same thing as the complex group ring C [ G ].  The importance of the group algebra is that it captures the unitary representation theory of G as shown in the following   Theorem. Let G be a locally compact group. If U is a strongly continuous unitary representation of G on a Hilbert space H , then        œÄ  U    (  f  )    =    ‚à´  G    f   (  g  )   U   (  g  )   d  Œº   (  g  )            subscript  œÄ  U   f     subscript   G     f  g  U  g  d  Œº  g      \pi_{U}(f)=\int_{G}f(g)U(g)\,d\mu(g)     is a non-degenerate bounded *-representation of the normed algebra C c ( G ). The map      U  ‚Ü¶   œÄ  U      maps-to  U   subscript  œÄ  U     U\mapsto\pi_{U}     is a bijection between the set of strongly continuous unitary representations of G and non-degenerate bounded *-representations of C c ( G ). This bijection respects unitary equivalence and strong containment . In particular, œÄ U is irreducible if and only if U is irreducible.   Non-degeneracy of a representation œÄ of C c ( G ) on a Hilbert space H œÄ means that      {   œÄ   (  f  )   Œæ   :    f  ‚àà    C  c    (  G  )     ,   Œæ  ‚àà   H  œÄ     }     conditional-set    œÄ  f  Œæ    formulae-sequence    f    subscript  normal-C  c   G      Œæ   subscript  H  œÄ       \left\{\pi(f)\xi:f\in\operatorname{C}_{c}(G),\xi\in H_{\pi}\right\}     is dense in H œÄ .  The convolution algebra L 1 ( G )  It is a standard theorem of measure theory that the completion of C c ( G ) in the L 1 ( G ) norm is isomorphic to the space L 1 ( G ) of equivalence classes of functions which are integrable with respect to the Haar measure , where, as usual, two functions are regarded as equivalent if and only if they differ only on a set of Haar measure zero.   Theorem.  L 1 ( G ) is a Banach *-algebra with the convolution product and involution defined above and with the L 1 norm. L 1 ( G ) also has a bounded approximate identity.   The group C*-algebra C* ( G )  Let C [ G ] be the group ring of a discrete group  G .  For a locally compact group G , the group C*-algebra  C* ( G ) of G is defined to be the C*-enveloping algebra of L 1 ( G ), i.e. the completion of C c ( G ) with respect to the largest C*-norm:         ‚à•  f  ‚à•    C  *    :=    sup  œÄ    ‚à•   œÄ   (  f  )    ‚à•     ,     assign   subscript   norm  f    superscript  C       subscript  supremum  œÄ    norm    œÄ  f       \|f\|_{C^{*}}:=\sup_{\pi}\|\pi(f)\|,     where œÄ ranges over all non-degenerate *-representations of C c ( G ) on Hilbert spaces. When G is discrete, it follows from the triangle inequality that, for any such œÄ, one has:        ‚à•   œÄ   (  f  )    ‚à•   ‚â§    ‚à•  f  ‚à•   1    ,       norm    œÄ  f     subscript   norm  f   1     \|\pi(f)\|\leq\|f\|_{1},     hence the norm is well-defined.  It follows from the definition that C* ( G ) has the following universal property : any *-homomorphism from C [ G ] to some B ( H ) (the C*-algebra of bounded operators on some Hilbert space  H ) factors through the inclusion map :        ùêÇ   [  G  ]    ‚Ü™    C  max  *    (  G  )     .     normal-‚Ü™    ùêÇ   delimited-[]  G       subscript   superscript  C    max   G     \mathbf{C}[G]\hookrightarrow C^{*}_{\text{max}}(G).     The reduced group C*-algebra C r * ( G )  The reduced group C*-algebra C r * ( G ) is the completion of C c ( G ) with respect to the norm         ‚à•  f  ‚à•    C  r  *    :=   sup   {    ‚à•   f  *  g   ‚à•   2   :     ‚à•  g  ‚à•   2   =  1   }     ,     assign   subscript   norm  f    subscript   superscript  C    r     supremum   conditional-set   subscript   norm    f  g    2      subscript   norm  g   2   1       \|f\|_{C^{*}_{r}}:=\sup\left\{\|f*g\|_{2}:\|g\|_{2}=1\right\},     where        ‚à•  f  ‚à•   2   =     ‚à´  G      |  f  |   2   d  Œº          subscript   norm  f   2       subscript   G      superscript    f   2   d  Œº       \|f\|_{2}=\sqrt{\int_{G}|f|^{2}d\mu}     is the L 2 norm. Since the completion of C c ( G ) with regard to the L 2 norm is a Hilbert space, the C r * norm is the norm of the bounded operator acting on L 2 ( G ) by convolution with f and thus a C*-norm.  Equivalently, C r * ( G ) is the C*-algebra generated by the image of the left regular representation on ‚Ñì 2 ( G ).  In general, C r * ( G ) is a quotient of C* ( G ). The reduced group C*-algebra is isomorphic to the non-reduced group C*-algebra defined above if and only if G is amenable .  von Neumann algebras associated to groups  The group von Neumann algebra W* ( G ) of G is the enveloping von Neumann algebra of C* ( G ).  For a discrete group G , we can consider the Hilbert space ‚Ñì 2 ( G ) for which G is an orthonormal basis . Since G operates on ‚Ñì 2 ( G ) by permuting the basis vectors, we can identify the complex group ring C [ G ] with a subalgebra of the algebra of bounded operators on ‚Ñì 2 ( G ). The weak closure of this subalgebra, NG , is a von Neumann algebra .  The center of NG can be described in terms of those elements of G whose conjugacy class is finite. In particular, if the identity element of G is the only group element with that property (that is, G has the infinite conjugacy class property ), the center of NG consists only of complex multiples of the identity.  NG is isomorphic to the hyperfinite type II 1 factor if and only if G is countable , amenable , and has the infinite conjugacy class property.
