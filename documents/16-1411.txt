   Theta constant      Theta constant   In mathematics, a theta constant or Thetanullwert (German for theta zero value; plural Thetanullwerte ) is the restriction θ m ( τ ) = θ m ( τ , 0 ) of a theta function  θ m (τ, z ) with rational characteristic m to z = 0. The variable τ may be a complex number in the upper half-plane in which case the theta constants are modular forms, or more generally may be an element of a Siegel upper half plane in which case the theta constants are Siegel modular forms . The theta function of a lattice is essentially a special case of a theta constant.  Definition  The theta function θ m ( τ , z ) = θ a , b ( τ , z )is defined by        θ   a  ,  b     (  τ  ,  z  )    =    ∑   ξ  ∈   Z  n      exp   [    π  i   (   ξ  +  a   )   τ    (   ξ  +  a   )   t    +    (   ξ  +  a   )     (   z  +  b   )   t     ]            subscript  θ   a  b     τ  z      subscript     ξ   superscript  Z  n           π  normal-i    ξ  a   τ   superscript    ξ  a   t        ξ  a    superscript    z  b   t         \theta_{a,b}(\tau,z)=\sum_{\xi\in Z^{n}}\exp\left[\pi{\rm{i}}(\xi+a)\tau(\xi+a%
 )^{t}+(\xi+a)(z+b)^{t}\right]     where   n is a positive integer, called the genus or rank.  m = ( a , b ) is called the characteristic  a , b are in R n  τ is a complex n by n matrix with positive definite imaginary part  z is in C n  t means the transpose of a row vector.   If a , b are in Q n then θ a , b ( τ ,0) is called a theta constant .  Examples  If n = 1 and a and b are both 0 or 1/2, then the functions θ a , b ( τ , z ) are the four Jacobi theta functions , and the functions θ a , b ( τ ,0) are the classical Jacobi theta constants. The theta constant θ 1/2,1/2 ( τ ,0) is identically zero, but the other three can be nonzero.  References     "  Category:Automorphic forms  Category:Modular forms
