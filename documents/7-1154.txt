   John's equation      John's equation   John's equation is an ultrahyperbolic partial differential equation satisfied by the X-ray transform of a function. It is named after Fritz John .  Given a function    f  :    ℝ  n   →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  ℝ  n   ℝ     f\colon\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   with compact support the X-ray transform is the integral over all lines in    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   . We will parameterise the lines by pairs of points     x  ,  y   ∈   ℝ  n        x  y    superscript  ℝ  n     x,y\in\mathbb{R}^{n}   ,    x  ≠  y      x  y    x\neq y   on each line and define    u   u   u    as the ray transform where        u   (  x  ,  y  )    =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞    f   (   x  +   t   (   y  -  x   )     )   d  t     .        u   x  y      superscript   subscript            f    x    t    y  x     d  t      u(x,y)=\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x+t(y-x))dt.   Such functions    u   u   u    are characterized by John's equations          ∂  2   u     ∂   x  i     ∂   y  j      -     ∂  2   u     ∂   y  i     ∂   x  j       =  0            superscript   2   u        subscript  x  i       subscript  y  j          superscript   2   u        subscript  y  i       subscript  x  j       0    \frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x_{i}\partial y_{j}}-\frac{\partial^{2}u}{%
 \partial y_{i}\partial x_{j}}=0   which is proved by Fritz John for dimension three and by Kurusa for higher dimensions.  In three-dimensional x-ray computerized tomography John's equation can be solved to fill in missing data, for example where the data is obtained from a point source traversing a curve, typically a helix.  More generally an ultrahyperbolic partial differential equation (a term coined by Richard Courant ) is a second order partial differential equation of the form         ∑    i  ,  j   =  1    2  n      a   i  j       ∂  2   u     ∂   x  i     ∂   x  j        +    ∑   i  =  1    2  n      b  i     ∂  u    ∂   x  i       +   c  u    =  0          superscript   subscript      i  j   1      2  n       subscript  a    i  j        superscript   2   u        subscript  x  i       subscript  x  j          superscript   subscript     i  1      2  n       subscript  b  i       u      subscript  x  i         c  u    0    \sum\limits_{i,j=1}^{2n}a_{ij}\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x_{i}\partial x_{j%
 }}+\sum\limits_{i=1}^{2n}b_{i}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_{i}}+cu=0   where    n  ≥  2      n  2    n\geq 2   , such that the quadratic form       ∑    i  ,  j   =  1    2  n      a   i  j     ξ  i    ξ  j        superscript   subscript      i  j   1      2  n       subscript  a    i  j     subscript  ξ  i    subscript  ξ  j      \sum\limits_{i,j=1}^{2n}a_{ij}\xi_{i}\xi_{j}   can be reduced by a linear change of variables to the form         ∑   i  =  1   n    ξ  i  2    -    ∑   i  =   n  +  1     2  n     ξ  i  2     .        superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript   subscript  ξ  i   2      superscript   subscript     i    n  1       2  n     superscript   subscript  ξ  i   2      \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\xi_{i}^{2}-\sum\limits_{i=n+1}^{2n}\xi_{i}^{2}.   It is not possible to arbitrarily specify the value of the solution on a non-characteristic hypersurface. John's paper however does give examples of manifolds on which an arbitrary specification of u can be extended to a solution.  References    Á.
