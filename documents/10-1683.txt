Ornithine racemase




Ornithine racemase

In enzymology, an ornithine racemase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-ornithine 
 
 
 
  D-ornithine
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-ornithine, and one product, D-ornithine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on amino acids and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ornithine racemase. This enzyme participates in d-arginine and d-ornithine metabolism.
