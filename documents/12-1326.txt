Ladder graph

In the mathematical field of graph theory, the ladder graph Ln is a planar undirected graph with 2n vertices and n+2(n-1) edges.1
The ladder graph can be obtained as the Cartesian product of two path graphs, one of which has only one edge: Ln,1 = Pn × P1.23 Adding two more crossed edges connecting the four degree-two vertices of a ladder graph produces a cubic graph, the Möbius ladder.
By construction, the ladder graph Ln is isomorphic to the grid graph G2,n and looks like a ladder with n rungs. It is Hamiltonian with girth 4 (if n>1) and chromatic index 3 (if n>2).
The chromatic number of the ladder graph is 2 and its chromatic polynomial is
