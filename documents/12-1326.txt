   Ladder graph      Ladder graph   In the mathematical field of graph theory , the ladder graph  L n is a planar  undirected graph with 2n vertices and n+2(n-1) edges. 1  The ladder graph can be obtained as the Cartesian product of two path graphs , one of which has only one edge: L n ,1 = P n × P 1 . 2 3 Adding two more crossed edges connecting the four degree-two vertices of a ladder graph produces a cubic graph , the Möbius ladder .  By construction, the ladder graph L n is isomorphic to the grid graph  G 2, n and looks like a ladder with n rungs. It is Hamiltonian with girth 4 (if n>1 ) and chromatic index 3 (if n>2 ).  The chromatic number of the ladder graph is 2 and its chromatic polynomial is     (   x  -  1   )   x    (     x  2   -   3  x    +  3   )    (   n  -  1   )          x  1   x   superscript       superscript  x  2     3  x    3     n  1      (x-1)x(x^{2}-3x+3)^{(n-1)}   .
