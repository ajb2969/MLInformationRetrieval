Hypernetted-chain equation

In statistical mechanics the hypernetted-chain equation is a closure relation to solve the Ornstein–Zernike equation which relates the direct correlation function to the total correlation function. It is commonly used in fluid theory to obtain e.g. expressions for the radial distribution function. It is given by:



where 
 
 
 
  is the number density of molecules, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  is the radial distribution function, 
 
 
 
  is the direct interaction between pairs. 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  being the Thermodynamic temperature and 
 
 
 
  the Boltzmann constant.
Derivation
The direct correlation function represents the direct correlation between two particles in a system containing N − 2 other particles. It can be represented by



where 
 
 
 
  (with 
 
 
 
  the potential of mean force) and 
 
 
 
  is the radial distribution function without the direct interaction between pairs 
 
 
 
  included; i.e. we write 
 
 
 
 
 . Thus we approximate

 
  by



By expanding the indirect part of 
 
 
 
  in the above equation and introducing the function 
 
 
 
  we can approximate 
 
 
 
 
  by writing:



with 
 
 
 
 .
This equation is the essence of the hypernetted chain equation. We can equivalently write



If we substitute this result in the Ornstein–Zernike equation



one obtains the hypernetted-chain equation:
