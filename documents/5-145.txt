Volume integral

In mathematics—in particular, in multivariable calculus—a volume integral refers to an integral over a 3-dimensional domain, that is, it is a special case of multiple integrals. Volume integrals are especially important in physics for many applications, for example, to calculate flux densities.
In coordinates
It can also mean a triple integral within a region D in R3 of a function

 
  and is usually written as:



A volume integral in cylindrical coordinates is



and a volume integral in spherical coordinates (using the convention for angles with 
 
 
 
  as the azimuth and 
 
 
 
  measured from the polar axis (see more on conventions)) has the form



Example 1
Integrating the function 
 
 
 
  over a unit cube yields the following result:



So the volume of the unit cube is 1 as expected. This is rather trivial however, and a volume integral is far more powerful. For instance if we have a scalar function 
 
 
 
  describing the density of the cube at a given point 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  then performing the volume integral will give the total mass of the cube:
