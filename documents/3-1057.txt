Vanish at infinity

In mathematics, a function on a normed vector space is said to vanish at infinity if


 
  as 
 
 

For example, the function


 
  defined on the real line vanishes at infinity.
More generally, a function 
 
 
 
  on a locally compact space (which may not have a norm) vanishes at infinity if, given any positive number

 
 , there is a compact subset 
 
 
 
  such that


 
  whenever the point 
 
 
 
  lies outside of 
 
 
 
 .
 In the other words,for each positive number 
 
 
 
  the set 
 
 
 
  is compact.
 For a given locally compact space 
 
 
 
 , the set of such functions


 
  (where 
 
 
 
  is either the field

 
  of real numbers or the field 
 
 
 
  of complex numbers) forms an 
 
 
 
 -vector space with respect to pointwise scalar multiplication and addition, often denoted 
 
 
 
 .
Both of these notions correspond to the intuitive notion of adding a point at infinity and requiring the values of the function to get arbitrarily close to zero as we approach it. This definition can be formalized in many cases by adding a point at infinity.
Rapidly decreasing
Refining the concept, one can look more closely to the rate of vanishing of functions at infinity. One of the basic intuitions of mathematical analysis is that the Fourier transform interchanges smoothness conditions with rate conditions on vanishing at infinity. The rapidly decreasing test functions of tempered distribution theory are smooth functions that are

o(|x|−N)
 

for all N, as |x| → ∞, and such that all their partial derivatives satisfy that condition, too. This condition is set up so as to be self-dual under Fourier transform, so that the corresponding distribution theory of tempered distributions will have the same good property.
