   Accessible category      Accessible category  The theory of '''accessible categories'''  originates from the work of [[Alexander Grothendieck|Gr othendieck]] completed by 1969 (Grothendieck (1972)) and Gabriel-Ulmer (1971). It has been further developed in 1989 by Michael Makkai and Robert Paré, with motivation coming from model theory , a branch of mathematical logic . 1 Accessible categories have also applications in homotopy theory . 2 3 Grothendieck also continued the development of the theory for homotopy-theoretic purposes in his (still partly unpublished) 1991 manuscript Les dérivateurs (Grothendieck (1991)). Some properties of accessible categories depend on the set universe in use, particularly on the cardinal properties. 4  Definition  Let   K   K   K   be an infinite regular cardinal and let   C   C   C   be a category . An object   X   X   X   of   C   C   C   is called    K   K   K   -presentable if the Hom functor     H  o  m   (  X  ,  -  )       H  o  m   X      Hom(X,-)   preserves   K   K   K   -directed colimits . The category   C   C   C   is called    K   K   K   -accessible provided that :      C   C   C   has   K   K   K   -directed colimits     C   C   C   has a set   P   P   P   of   K   K   K   -presentable objects such that every object of   C   C   C   is a   K   K   K   -directed colimit of objects of   P   P   P      A category   C   C   C   is called accessible if   C   C   C   is   K   K   K   -accessible for some infinite regular cardinal   K   K   K   .  A    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   -presentable object is usually called finitely presentable , and an    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   -accessible category is often called finitely accessible .  Examples   The category    R   R   R   -Mod of (left)   R   R   R   -modules is finitely accessible for any ring   R   R   R   . The objects that are finitely presentable in the above sense are precisely the finitely presented modules (which are not necessarily the same as the finitely generated modules unless   R   R   R   is noetherian ).  The category of simplicial sets is finitely-accessible.  The category Mod(T) of models of some first-order theory T with countable signature is    ℵ  1     subscript  normal-ℵ  1    \aleph_{1}   -accessible.    ℵ  1     subscript  normal-ℵ  1    \aleph_{1}   -presentable objects are models with a countable number of elements.   Further notions  When the category   C   C   C   is cocomplete ,   C   C   C   is called a locally presentable category. Locally presentable categories are also complete .
