   Unitary divisor      Unitary divisor   In mathematics , a natural number  a is a unitary divisor of a number b if a is a divisor of b and if a and    b  a      b  a    \frac{b}{a}   are coprime , having no common factor other than 1. Thus, 5 is a unitary divisor of 60, because 5 and     60  5   =  12        60  5   12    \frac{60}{5}=12   have only 1 as a common factor, while 6 is a divisor but not a unitary divisor of 60, as 6 and     60  6   =  10        60  6   10    \frac{60}{6}=10   have a common factor other than 1, namely 2. 1 is a unitary divisor of every natural number.  Equivalently, a given divisor a of b is a unitary divisor if and only if every prime factor of a has the same multiplicity in a as it has in b .  The sum of unitary divisors function is denoted by the lowercase Greek letter sigma thus: σ*( n ). The sum of the k -th powers of the unitary divisors is denoted by σ* k ( n ):         σ  k  *    (  n  )    =     ∑       d  ∣  n         gcd   (  d  ,   n  /  d   )    =  1          d  k     .         superscript   subscript  σ  k     n     subscript    STACKED   fragments  d  normal-∣  n       d    n  d    1      superscript  d  k      \sigma_{k}^{*}(n)=\sum_{d\mid n\atop\gcd(d,n/d)=1}\!\!d^{k}.     If the proper unitary divisors of a given number add up to that number, then that number is called a unitary perfect number .  Properties  The number of unitary divisors of a number n is 2 k , where k is the number of distinct prime factors of n . The sum of the unitary divisors of n is odd if n is a power of 2 (including 1), and even otherwise.  Both the count and the sum of the unitary divisors of n are multiplicative functions of n that are not completely multiplicative. The Dirichlet generating function is         ζ   (  s  )   ζ   (   s  -  k   )     ζ   (    2  s   -  k   )     =    ∑   n  ≥  1       σ  k  *    (  n  )     n  s      .          ζ  s  ζ    s  k      ζ      2  s   k       subscript     n  1         superscript   subscript  σ  k     n    superscript  n  s       \frac{\zeta(s)\zeta(s-k)}{\zeta(2s-k)}=\sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{\sigma_{k}^{*}(n)}{%
 n^{s}}.     Every divisor of n is unitary if and only if n is square-free .  Odd unitary divisors  The sum of the k -th powers of the odd unitary divisors is         σ  k    (  o  )   *     (  n  )    =     ∑           d  ∣  n        d  ≡   1     (   mod  2   )               gcd   (  d  ,   n  /  d   )    =  1          d  k     .         superscript   subscript  σ  k    o     n     subscript    STACKED   STACKED   fragments  d  normal-∣  n     d   annotated  1   pmod  2          d    n  d    1      superscript  d  k      \sigma_{k}^{(o)*}(n)=\sum_{{d\mid n\atop d\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}2)}%
 \atop\gcd(d,n/d)=1}\!\!d^{k}.     It is also multiplicative, with Dirichlet generating function         ζ   (  s  )   ζ   (   s  -  k   )    (   1  -   2   k  -  s     )     ζ   (    2  s   -  k   )    (   1  -   2   k  -   2  s      )     =    ∑   n  ≥  1       σ  k    (  o  )   *     (  n  )     n  s      .          ζ  s  ζ    s  k     1   superscript  2    k  s        ζ      2  s   k     1   superscript  2    k    2  s          subscript     n  1         superscript   subscript  σ  k    o     n    superscript  n  s       \frac{\zeta(s)\zeta(s-k)(1-2^{k-s})}{\zeta(2s-k)(1-2^{k-2s})}=\sum_{n\geq 1}%
 \frac{\sigma_{k}^{(o)*}(n)}{n^{s}}.     Bi-unitary divisors  A divisor d of n is a bi-unitary divisor if the greatest common unitary divisor of d and n / d is 1. The number of bi-unitary divisors of n is a multiplicative function of n with average order     A   log  x       A    x     A\log x   where 1       A  =    ∏  p    (   1  -    p  -  1     p  2    (   p  +  1   )      )     .      A    subscript  product  p     1      p  1      superscript  p  2     p  1         A=\prod_{p}\left({1-\frac{p-1}{p^{2}(p+1)}}\right)\ .     A bi-unitary perfect number is one equal to the sum of its bi-unitary aliquot divisors. The only such numbers are 6, 60 and 90. 2  References    Section B3.
