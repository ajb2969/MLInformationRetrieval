   Spherical wedge      Spherical wedge   (Figure)  A spherical wedge with radius r and angle of the wedge α   In geometry , a spherical wedge or ungula is a portion of a ball bounded by two plane semidisks and a spherical lune (termed the wedge's base ). The angle between the radii lying within the bounding semidisks is the dihedral  angle of the wedge  α . If AB is a semidisk that forms a ball when completely revolved about the z -axis, revolving AB only through a given α produces a spherical wedge of the same angle α . 1 Beman (2008) 2 remarks that "a spherical wedge is to the sphere of which it is a part as the angle of the wedge is to a perigon." A spherical wedge of α = π radians (180°) is called a hemisphere , while a spherical wedge of α = 2π radians (360°) constitutes a complete ball.  The volume of a spherical wedge can be intuitively related to the AB definition in that while the volume of a ball of radius r is given by     4  3   π   r  3         4  3   π   superscript  r  3     \tfrac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}   , the volume a spherical wedge of the same radius r is given by 3       V  =     α   2  π    ⋅   4  3    π   r  3    =    2  3   α   r  3     .        V     normal-⋅    α    2  π      4  3    π   superscript  r  3             2  3   α   superscript  r  3       V=\frac{\alpha}{2\pi}\cdot\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}=\frac{2}{3}\alpha r^{3}.     Extrapolating the same principle and considering that the surface area of a sphere is given by    4  π   r  2       4  π   superscript  r  2     4\pi r^{2}   , it can be seen that the surface area of the lune corresponding to the same wedge is given by      A  =     α   2  π    ⋅  4   π   r  2    =   2  α   r  2          A     normal-⋅    α    2  π    4   π   superscript  r  2           2  α   superscript  r  2       A=\frac{\alpha}{2\pi}\cdot 4\pi r^{2}=2\alpha r^{2}     Hart (2009) 4 states that the "volume of a spherical wedge is to the volume of the sphere as the number of degrees in the [angle of the wedge] is to 360". Hence, and through derivation of the spherical wedge volume formula, it can be concluded that, if    V  s     subscript  V  s    V_{s}   is the volume of the sphere and    V  w     subscript  V  w    V_{w}   is the volume of a given spherical wedge,        V  w    V  s    =   α   2  π           subscript  V  w    subscript  V  s      α    2  π      \frac{V_{w}}{V_{s}}=\frac{\alpha}{2\pi}     Also, if S l is the area of a given wedge's lune, and S s is the area of the wedge's sphere, 5        S  l    S  s    =   α   2  π           subscript  S  l    subscript  S  s      α    2  π      \frac{S_{l}}{S_{s}}=\frac{\alpha}{2\pi}     See also   Spherical cap   Notes   A.  A distinction is sometimes drawn between the terms " sphere " and " ball ", where a sphere is regarded as being merely the outer surface of a solid ball. It is common to use the terms interchangeably, as the commentaries of both Beman (2008) and Hart (2008) do.   References  "  Category:Spherical geometry     ↩  ↩   ↩  ↩
