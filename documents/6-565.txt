   SU(6) (physics)      SU(6) (physics)   SU(6) is a grand unified theory which includes the Georgi–Glashow SU(5) gauge group.  The fermionic matter content of this model comes in three generations (copies) of      15  ⊕   6  ¯   ⊕   6  ¯      direct-sum  15   normal-¯  6    normal-¯  6     15\oplus\bar{6}\oplus\bar{6}     as SU(6) representations .  This gauge group is broken down to the Georgi–Glashow model by a pair of 6 H /     6  ¯   H     subscript   normal-¯  6   H    \bar{6}_{H}   Higgs fields.        S  U   (  6  )        6  H   /    6  ¯   H        ⟶     S  U   (  5  )    ×  U    (  1  )           S  U  6       subscript  6  H    subscript   normal-¯  6   H      normal-⟶    S  U  5   U   1    SU(6)\begin{matrix}6_{H}/\bar{6}_{H}\\
 \longrightarrow\end{matrix}SU(5)\times U(1)     The fermions decompose as      15  →   10  ⊕  5      normal-→  15   direct-sum  10  5     15\rightarrow 10\oplus 5          6  ¯   →    5  ¯   ⊕  1      normal-→   normal-¯  6    direct-sum   normal-¯  5   1     \bar{6}\rightarrow\bar{5}\oplus 1     The Yukawa coupling     6  ¯     6  ¯   H   15       normal-¯  6    subscript   normal-¯  6   H   15    \bar{6}\bar{6}_{H}15   causes 5 and a    5  ¯     normal-¯  5    \bar{5}   SU(5)-rep of fermions to pair up and acquire GUT scale masses for each generation.  An adjoint Higgs 35 H breaks the model down further to the standard model .  Most important, SU(6) is also used as a classification group for baryons and mesons . In fact it takes in account both SU(3) flavour and SU(2) spin. Then, quarks u,d,s, with spin up and down belong to the fundamental representation 6 . Mesons belong to the 35 representation and baryons to the 56 representation obtained from the product quark-antiquark and quark-quark-quark, respectively.  Recently, a new type of grand unified theories based on SU(6) group has been proposed to realize a unification of strong and electroweak interactions. 1 The work provides a complete form of 35 generators in SU(6) group.
