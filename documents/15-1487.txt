Nigerose phosphorylase

Nigerose phosphorylase (, cphy1874 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 3-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-D-glucopyranose:phosphate beta-D-glucosyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

3-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-D-glucopyranose + phosphate

 
  D-glucose + beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate
