   4-hydroxybenzoate nonaprenyltransferase      4-hydroxybenzoate nonaprenyltransferase   In enzymology , a 4-hydroxybenzoate nonaprenyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   solanesyl diphosphate (nonaisoprenol diphosphate) + 4-hydroxybenzoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + nonaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are nonaisoprenol diphosphate and 4-hydroxybenzoate , whereas its two products are diphosphate and nonaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. This enzyme participates in ubiquinone  biosynthesis .  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is solanesyl-diphosphate:4-hydroxybenzoate nonaprenyltransferase . Other names in common use include:   nonaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate transferase,  4-hydroxybenzoate transferase,  p-hydroxybenzoate dimethylallyltransferase,  p-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase,  p-hydroxybenzoic acid-polyprenyl transferase, and  p-hydroxybenzoic-polyprenyl transferase.
