Galactolipase

In enzymology, a galactolipase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1,2-diacyl-3-beta-D-galactosyl-sn-glycerol + 2 H2O 
 
 
 
  3-beta-D-galactosyl-sn-glycerol + 2 carboxylates
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1,2-diacyl-3-beta-D-galactosyl-sn-glycerol and H2O, whereas its two products are 3-beta-D-galactosyl-sn-glycerol and carboxylate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,2-diacyl-3-beta-D-galactosyl-sn-glycerol acylhydrolase. Other names in common use include galactolipid lipase, polygalactolipase, and galactolipid acylhydrolase. This enzyme participates in glycerolipid metabolism.
