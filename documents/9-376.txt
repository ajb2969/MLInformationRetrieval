   Hafner–Sarnak–McCurley constant      Hafner–Sarnak–McCurley constant   The Hafner–Sarnak–McCurley constant is a mathematical constant representing the probability that the determinants of two randomly chosen square integer matrices will be relatively prime . The probability depends on the matrix size, n , in accordance with the formula        D   (  n  )    =    ∏   k  =  1   ∞    {   1  -    [   1  -    ∏   j  =  1   n    (   1  -   p  k   -  j     )     ]   2    }     ,        D  n     superscript   subscript  product    k  1         1   superscript   delimited-[]    1    superscript   subscript  product    j  1    n     1   superscript   subscript  p  k     j        2        D(n)=\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\left\{1-\left[1-\prod_{j=1}^{n}(1-p_{k}^{-j})\right]%
 ^{2}\right\},     where p k is the k th prime number. The constant is the limit of this expression as n approaches infinity. Its value is roughly 0.3532363719... .  References    .   .   .   .   External links     "  Category:Mathematical constants
