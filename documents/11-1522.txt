Hypotaurocyamine kinase

In enzymology, a hypotaurocyamine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + hypotaurocyamine 
 
 
 
  ADP + Nomega-phosphohypotaurocyamine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and hypotaurocyamine, whereas its two products are ADP and Nomega-phosphohypotaurocyamine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a nitrogenous group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:hypotaurocyamine N-phosphotransferase.
