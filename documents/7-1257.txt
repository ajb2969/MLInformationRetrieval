Poisson–Lie group

In mathematics, a Poisson–Lie group is a Poisson manifold that is also a Lie group, with the group multiplication being compatible with the Poisson algebra structure on the manifold. The algebra of a Poisson–Lie group is a Lie bialgebra.
Definition
A Poisson–Lie group is a Lie group G equipped with a Poisson bracket for which the group multiplication 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  is a Poisson map, where the manifold G×G has been given the structure of a product Poisson manifold.
Explicitly, the following identity must hold for a Poisson–Lie group:



where f1 and f2 are real-valued, smooth functions on the Lie group, while g and g' are elements of the Lie group. Here, Lg denotes left-multiplication and Rg denotes right-multiplication.
If 
 
 
 
  denotes the corresponding Poisson bivector on G, the condition above can be equivalently stated as



Note that for Poisson-Lie group always 
 
 
 
 , or equivalently 
 
 
 
 . This means that non-trivial Poisson-Lie structure is never symplectic, not even of constant rank.
Homomorphisms
A Poisson–Lie group homomorphism 
 
 
 
  is defined to be both a Lie group homomorphism and a Poisson map. Although this is the "obvious" definition, neither left translations nor right translations are Poisson maps. Also, the inversion map 
 
 
 
  taking 
 
 
 
  is not a Poisson map either, although it is an anti-Poisson map:



for any two smooth functions 
 
 
 
  on G.
