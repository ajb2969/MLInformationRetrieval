(S)-2-hydroxy-fatty-acid dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a (S)-2-hydroxy-fatty-acid dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-2-hydroxystearate + NAD+

 
  2-oxostearate + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-2-hydroxystearate and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are 2-oxostearate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-2-hydroxystearate:NAD+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include dehydrogenase, L-2-hydroxy fatty acid, L-2-hydroxy fatty acid dehydrogenase, and 2-hydroxy fatty acid oxidase.
