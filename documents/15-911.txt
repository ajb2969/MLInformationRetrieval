   Long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase      Long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase   Long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (, palmitoyl-CoA dehydrogenase , palmitoyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase , long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase , long-chain-acyl-CoA:(acceptor) 2,3-oxidoreductase , ACADL (gene). ) is an enzyme with system name long-chain acyl-CoA:electron-transfer flavoprotein 2,3-oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 4 5 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   a long-chain acyl-CoA + electron-transfer flavoprotein    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a long-chain trans-2,3-dehydroacyl-CoA + reduced electron-transfer flavoprotein   This enzyme contains FAD as prosthetic group .
