Hypsometric equation

The hypsometric equation, also known as the thickness equation, relates an atmospheric pressure ratio to the equivalent thickness of an atmospheric layer under the assumptions of constant temperature and gravity. It is derived from the hydrostatic equation and the ideal gas law.
Equation
The hypsometric equation is expressed as:1



where:


 
  = thickness of the layer [m]


 
  = geometric height [m]


 
  = specific gas constant for dry air


 
  = mean temperature in Kelvin [K]


 
  = gravitational acceleration [m/s2]


 
  = pressure [Pa]
In meteorology, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are isobaric surfaces. In altimetry with the International Standard Atmosphere the hypsometric equation is used to compute pressure at a given height in isothermal layers in the upper and lower stratosphere.
Derivation
The hydrostatic equation:



where 
 
 
 
  is the density [kg/m3], is used to generate the equation for hydrostatic equilibrium, written in differential form:



This is combined with the ideal gas law:



to eliminate 
 
 
 
 :



This is integrated from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 :



R and g are constant with z, so they can be brought outside the integral. If temperature varies linearly with z (as it is assumed to do in the International Standard Atmosphere), it can also be brought outside the integral when replaced with 
 
 
 
 , the average temperature between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .



Integration gives:



simplifying to:



Rearranging:



or, eliminating the ln:
