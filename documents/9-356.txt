   Hypsometric equation      Hypsometric equation   The hypsometric equation , also known as the thickness equation, relates an atmospheric pressure ratio to the equivalent thickness of an atmospheric layer under the assumptions of constant temperature and gravity . It is derived from the hydrostatic equation and the ideal gas law .  Equation  The hypsometric equation is expressed as: 1       h   =    z  2   -   z  1    =     R  ⋅   T  ¯    g   ⋅   ln   (    p  1    p  2    )           h     subscript  z  2    subscript  z  1          normal-⋅     normal-⋅  R   normal-¯  T    g        subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2         \ h=z_{2}-z_{1}=\frac{R\cdot\bar{T}}{g}\cdot\ln\left(\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}\right)     where:      h    h   \ h   = thickness of the layer [m]      z    z   \ z   = geometric height [m]      R    R   \ R   = specific gas constant for dry air       T  ¯      normal-¯  T    \ \bar{T}   = mean temperature in Kelvin [K]      g    g   \ g   = gravitational acceleration [m/s 2 ]      p    p   \ p   = pressure [ Pa ]  In meteorology ,    p  1     subscript  p  1    p_{1}   and    p  2     subscript  p  2    p_{2}   are isobaric surfaces. In altimetry with the International Standard Atmosphere the hypsometric equation is used to compute pressure at a given height in isothermal layers in the upper and lower stratosphere .  Derivation  The hydrostatic equation:       p   =   ρ  ⋅  g  ⋅  z       p   normal-⋅  ρ  g  z     \ p=\rho\cdot g\cdot z     where    ρ    ρ   \ \rho   is the density [kg/m 3 ], is used to generate the equation for hydrostatic equilibrium , written in differential form:        d  p   =   -    ρ  ⋅  g  ⋅  d   z     .        d  p        normal-⋅  ρ  g  d   z      dp=-\rho\cdot g\cdot dz.     This is combined with the ideal gas law :       p   =   ρ  ⋅  R  ⋅  T       p   normal-⋅  ρ  R  T     \ p=\rho\cdot R\cdot T     to eliminate    ρ    ρ   \ \rho   :         d  p   p   =      -  g    R  ⋅  T     d  z    .          normal-d  p   p         g    normal-⋅  R  T    normal-d  z     \frac{\mathrm{d}p}{p}=\frac{-g}{R\cdot T}\,\mathrm{d}z.     This is integrated from     z   1     subscript  z  1    \ z_{1}   to     z   2     subscript  z  2    \ z_{2}   :         ∫   p   (   z  1   )     p   (   z  2   )       d  p   p    =    ∫   z  1    z  2        -  g    R  ⋅  T     d  z     .        superscript   subscript     p   subscript  z  1       p   subscript  z  2         normal-d  p   p      superscript   subscript    subscript  z  1     subscript  z  2          g    normal-⋅  R  T    normal-d  z      \ \int_{p(z_{1})}^{p(z_{2})}\frac{\mathrm{d}p}{p}=\int_{z_{1}}^{z_{2}}\frac{-g%
 }{R\cdot T}\,\mathrm{d}z.     R and g are constant with z, so they can be brought outside the integral. If temperature varies linearly with z (as it is assumed to do in the International Standard Atmosphere ), it can also be brought outside the integral when replaced with    T  ¯     normal-¯  T    \bar{T}   , the average temperature between    z  1     subscript  z  1    z_{1}   and    z  2     subscript  z  2    z_{2}   .         ∫   p   (   z  1   )     p   (   z  2   )       d  p   p    =     -  g    R  ⋅   T  ¯        ∫   z  1    z  2      d  z      .        superscript   subscript     p   subscript  z  1       p   subscript  z  2         normal-d  p   p          g    normal-⋅  R   normal-¯  T       superscript   subscript    subscript  z  1     subscript  z  2      normal-d  z       \ \int_{p(z_{1})}^{p(z_{2})}\frac{\mathrm{d}p}{p}=\frac{-g}{R\cdot\bar{T}}\int%
 _{z_{1}}^{z_{2}}\,\mathrm{d}z.     Integration gives:       ln   (    p   (   z  2   )     p   (   z  1   )     )    =     -  g    R  ⋅   T  ¯      (    z  2   -   z  1    )              p   subscript  z  2      p   subscript  z  1            g    normal-⋅  R   normal-¯  T        subscript  z  2    subscript  z  1       \ln\left(\frac{p(z_{2})}{p(z_{1})}\right)=\frac{-g}{R\cdot\bar{T}}(z_{2}-z_{1})     simplifying to:        ln   (    p  1    p  2    )    =    g   R  ⋅   T  ¯      (    z  2   -   z  1    )     .           subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2         g   normal-⋅  R   normal-¯  T        subscript  z  2    subscript  z  1       \ln\left(\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}\right)=\frac{g}{R\cdot\bar{T}}(z_{2}-z_{1}).     Rearranging:       (    z  2   -   z  1    )   =     R  ⋅   T  ¯    g    ln   (    p  1    p  2    )            subscript  z  2    subscript  z  1         normal-⋅  R   normal-¯  T    g        subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2        (z_{2}-z_{1})=\frac{R\cdot\bar{T}}{g}\ln\left(\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}\right)     or, eliminating the ln:         p  1    p  2    =   e    g   R  ⋅   T  ¯     ⋅   (    z  2   -   z  1    )      .         subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2     superscript  e   normal-⋅    g   normal-⋅  R   normal-¯  T        subscript  z  2    subscript  z  1        \frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}=e^{{g\over R\cdot\bar{T}}\cdot(z_{2}-z_{1})}.
