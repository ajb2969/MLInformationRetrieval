   3-deoxy-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase      3-deoxy-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase   In enzymology , a 3-deoxy-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CTP + 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + CMP-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CTP and 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate , whereas its two products are diphosphate and CMP-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is CTP:3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase . Other names in common use include CMP-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate pyrophosphorylase , 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate cytidylyltransferase , 3-Deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase , CMP-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate synthetase , CMP-KDO synthetase , CTP:CMP-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase , and cytidine monophospho-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate pyrophosphorylase . This enzyme participates in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis .
