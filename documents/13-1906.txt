Glossary of algebraic groups

There are a number of mathematical notions to study and classify algebraic groups.
In the sequel, G denotes an algebraic group over a field k.

remarks





linear algebraic group

| A Zariski closed subgroup of 
 
 

for some n

| 



| Every affine algebraic group is isomorphic to a linear algebraic group, and vice-versa



affine algebraic group

| An algebraic group which is an affine variety

| 

, non-example: elliptic curve

| The notion of affine algebraic group stresses the independence from any embedding in 
 
 




commutative

| The underlying (abstract) group is abelian.

| 
 
 
 
  (the additive group), 
 
 
 
  (the multiplicative group),1 any complete algebraic group (see abelian variety)

|



diagonalizable group

|A closed subgroup of 
 
 
 
 , the group of diagonal matrices (of size n-by-n)

|

|



simple algebraic group

| A connected group which has no non-trivial connected normal subgroups

| 
 
 


|



semisimple group

| An affine algebraic group with trivial radical

| 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 


| In characteristic zero, the Lie algebra of a semisimple group is a semisimple Lie algebra



reductive group

| An affine algebraic group with trivial unipotent radical

| Any finite group, 
 
 


| Any semisimple group is reductive



unipotent group

| An affine algebraic group such that all elements are unipotent

| The group of upper-triangular n-by-n matrices with all diagonal entries equal to 1

| Any unipotent group is nilpotent



torus

| A group that becomes isomorphic to 
 
 
 
  when passing to the algebraic closure of k.

| 
 
 


| G is said to be split by some bigger field ''k' '', if G becomes isomorphic to Gmn as an algebraic group over k'.



character group X∗(G)

| The group of characters, i.e., group homomorphisms 
 
 


| 
 
 


|



Lie algebra Lie(G)

| The tangent space of G at the unit element.

| 
 
 
 
 ) is the space of all n-by-n matrices

| Equivalently, the space of all left-invariant derivations.
