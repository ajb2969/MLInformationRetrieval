   Glossary of algebraic groups      Glossary of algebraic groups   There are a number of mathematical notions to study and classify algebraic groups .  In the sequel, G denotes an algebraic group over a field  k .      notion   explanation   example   remarks       linear algebraic group   | A Zariski closed subgroup of    GL  n     subscript  GL  n    {\rm GL}_{n}     for some n   |     SL  n     subscript  SL  n    {\rm SL}_{n}      | Every affine algebraic group is isomorphic to a linear algebraic group, and vice-versa     affine algebraic group   | An algebraic group which is an affine variety   |     GL  n     subscript  GL  n    {\rm GL}_{n}    , non-example: elliptic curve   | The notion of affine algebraic group stresses the independence from any embedding in    GL  n     subscript  GL  n    {\rm GL}_{n}        commutative   | The underlying (abstract) group is abelian .   |    𝔾  a     subscript  𝔾  a    {\mathbb{G}}_{a}   (the additive group ),    𝔾  m     subscript  𝔾  m    {\mathbb{G}}_{m}   (the multiplicative group ), 1 any complete algebraic group (see abelian variety )   |     diagonalizable group   |A closed subgroup of     (   𝔾  m   )   n     superscript   subscript  𝔾  m   n    (\mathbb{G}_{m})^{n}   , the group of diagonal matrices (of size n -by- n )   |   |     simple algebraic group   | A connected group which has no non-trivial connected normal subgroups   |    SL  n     subscript  SL  n    {\rm SL}_{n}      |     semisimple group   | An affine algebraic group with trivial radical   |    SL  n     subscript  SL  n    {\rm SL}_{n}   ,    SO  n     subscript  SO  n    {\rm SO}_{n}      | In characteristic zero, the Lie algebra of a semisimple group is a semisimple Lie algebra     reductive group   | An affine algebraic group with trivial unipotent radical   | Any finite group,    GL  n     subscript  GL  n    {\rm GL}_{n}      | Any semisimple group is reductive     unipotent group   | An affine algebraic group such that all elements are unipotent   | The group of upper-triangular n -by- n matrices with all diagonal entries equal to 1   | Any unipotent group is nilpotent     torus   | A group that becomes isomorphic to     (   𝔾  m   )   n     superscript   subscript  𝔾  m   n    (\mathbb{G}_{m})^{n}   when passing to the algebraic closure of k .   |    SO  2     subscript  SO  2    {\rm SO}_{2}      | G is said to be split by some bigger field ''k' '', if G becomes isomorphic to G m n as an algebraic group over k'.     character group  X ∗ ( G )   | The group of characters, i.e., group homomorphisms    G  →   𝔾  m      normal-→  G   subscript  𝔾  m     G\rightarrow{\mathbb{G}}_{m}      |      X  *    (   𝔾  m   )    ≅  ℤ         superscript  X     subscript  𝔾  m    ℤ    X^{*}(\mathbb{G}_{m})\cong\mathbb{Z}      |     Lie algebra Lie( G )   | The tangent space of G at the unit element.   |    Lie   (   GL  n   )       Lie   subscript  GL  n     {\rm Lie}({\rm GL}_{n})   ) is the space of all n -by- n matrices   | Equivalently, the space of all left-invariant derivations .
