   Reciprocal polynomial      Reciprocal polynomial   In algebra , the reciprocal polynomial  p * of a polynomial  p with coefficients from an arbitrary field , such as        p   (  x  )    =    a  0   +    a  1   x   +    a  2    x  2    +  ⋯  +    a  n    x  n      ,        p  x      subscript  a  0      subscript  a  1   x      subscript  a  2    superscript  x  2    normal-⋯     subscript  a  n    superscript  x  n       p(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}x^{n},\,\!   is the polynomial 1         p  *    (  x  )    =    a  n   +    a   n  -  1    x   +  ⋯  +    a  0    x  n     =    x  n   p   (   x   -  1    )     .           superscript  p    x      subscript  a  n      subscript  a    n  1    x   normal-⋯     subscript  a  0    superscript  x  n             superscript  x  n   p   superscript  x    1        p^{*}(x)=a_{n}+a_{n-1}x+\cdots+a_{0}x^{n}=x^{n}p(x^{-1}).     Essentially, the coefficients are written in reverse order. They arise naturally in linear algebra as the characteristic polynomial of the inverse of a matrix.  In the special case that the polynomial  p has complex coefficients, that is,        p   (  z  )    =    a  0   +    a  1   z   +    a  2    z  2    +  ⋯  +    a  n    z  n      ,        p  z      subscript  a  0      subscript  a  1   z      subscript  a  2    superscript  z  2    normal-⋯     subscript  a  n    superscript  z  n       p(z)=a_{0}+a_{1}z+a_{2}z^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}z^{n},\,\!     the conjugate reciprocal polynomial , p † given by,         p  †    (  z  )    =     a  n   ¯   +     a   n  -  1    ¯   z   +  ⋯  +     a  0   ¯    z  n     =    z  n     p   (    z  ¯    -  1    )    ¯     ,           superscript  p  normal-†   z      normal-¯   subscript  a  n       normal-¯   subscript  a    n  1     z   normal-⋯     normal-¯   subscript  a  0     superscript  z  n             superscript  z  n    normal-¯    p   superscript   normal-¯  z     1          p^{\dagger}(z)=\overline{a_{n}}+\overline{a_{n-1}}z+\cdots+\overline{a_{0}}z^{%
 n}=z^{n}\overline{p(\bar{z}^{-1})},     where     a  i   ¯     normal-¯   subscript  a  i     \overline{a_{i}}   denotes the complex conjugate of    a  i     subscript  a  i    a_{i}\,\!   , is also called the reciprocal polynomial when no confusion can arise.  A polynomial p is called self-reciprocal if     p   (  x  )    ≡    p  *    (  x  )          p  x      superscript  p    x     p(x)\equiv p^{*}(x)   .  The coefficients of a self-reciprocal polynomial satisfy a i = a n − i , and in this case p is also called a palindromic polynomial . In the conjugate reciprocal case, the coefficients must be real to satisfy the condition.  Properties  Reciprocal polynomials have several connections with their original polynomials, including:   α is a root of polynomial p if and only if α −1 is a root of p *. 2  If p ( x ) ≠ x then p is irreducible if and only if p * is irreducible. 3  p is primitive if and only if p * is primitive. 4   Other properties of reciprocal polynomials may be obtained, for instance:   If a polynomial is self-reciprocal and irreducible then it must have even degree. 5   Conjugate reciprocal polynomials  A polynomial is conjugate reciprocal if     p   (  x  )    ≡    p  †    (  x  )          p  x      superscript  p  normal-†   x     p(x)\equiv p^{\dagger}(x)   and self-inversive if     p   (  x  )    =   ω   p  †    (  x  )          p  x     ω   superscript  p  normal-†   x     p(x)=\omega p^{\dagger}(x)   for a scale factor ω on the unit circle . 6  If p ( z ) is the minimal polynomial of z 0 with | z 0 | = 1,     z  0   ≠  1       subscript  z  0   1    z_{0}\neq 1   , and p ( z ) has real coefficients, then p ( z ) is self-reciprocal. This follows because        z  0  n     p   (   1  /    z  0   ¯    )    ¯    =    z  0  n     p   (   z  0   )    ¯    =    z  0  n    0  ¯    =  0.           superscript   subscript  z  0   n    normal-¯    p    1   normal-¯   subscript  z  0           superscript   subscript  z  0   n    normal-¯    p   subscript  z  0              superscript   subscript  z  0   n    normal-¯  0         0.     z_{0}^{n}\overline{p(1/\bar{z_{0}})}=z_{0}^{n}\overline{p(z_{0})}=z_{0}^{n}%
 \bar{0}=0.     So z 0 is a root of the polynomial     z  n     p   (    z  ¯    -  1    )    ¯        superscript  z  n    normal-¯    p   superscript   normal-¯  z     1        z^{n}\overline{p(\bar{z}^{-1})}   which has degree n . But, the minimal polynomial is unique, hence       c  p   (  z  )    =    z  n     p   (    z  ¯    -  1    )    ¯          c  p  z      superscript  z  n    normal-¯    p   superscript   normal-¯  z     1         cp(z)=z^{n}\overline{p(\bar{z}^{-1})}   for some constant c , i.e.     c   a  i    =    a   n  -  i    ¯   =   a   n  -  i            c   subscript  a  i     normal-¯   subscript  a    n  i           subscript  a    n  i       ca_{i}=\overline{a_{n-i}}=a_{n-i}   . Sum from i = 0 to n and note that 1 is not a root of p . We conclude that c = 1.  A consequence is that the cyclotomic polynomials     Φ  n     subscript  normal-Φ  n    \Phi_{n}   are self-reciprocal for    n  >  1      n  1    n>1   ; this is used in the special number field sieve to allow numbers of the form     x  11   ±  1     plus-or-minus   superscript  x  11   1    x^{11}\pm 1   ,     x  13   ±  1     plus-or-minus   superscript  x  13   1    x^{13}\pm 1   ,     x  15   ±  1     plus-or-minus   superscript  x  15   1    x^{15}\pm 1   and     x  21   ±  1     plus-or-minus   superscript  x  21   1    x^{21}\pm 1   to be factored taking advantage of the algebraic factors by using polynomials of degree 5, 6, 4 and 6 respectively – note that   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   ( Euler's totient function ) of the exponents are 10, 12, 8 and 12.  Application in coding theory  The reciprocal polynomial finds a use in the theory of cyclic error correcting codes . Suppose x n − 1 can be factored into the product of two polynomials, say x n − 1 = g ( x ) p ( x ). When g ( x ) generates a cyclic code C , then the reciprocal polynomial p *(x) generates C ⊥ , the orthogonal complement of C . 7 Also, C is self-orthogonal (that is, C ⊆ C ⊥ ), if and only if p *( x ) divides g ( x ). 8  Notes  References        External links   Reciprocal Polynomial (on MathWorld )   "  Category:Polynomials     ↩  ↩  ↩    ↩  ↩  ↩
