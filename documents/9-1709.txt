   Mazur's lemma      Mazur's lemma   In mathematics , Mazur's lemma is a result in the theory of Banach spaces . It shows that any weakly convergent sequence in a Banach space has a sequence of convex combinations of its members that converges strongly to the same limit, and is used in the proof of Tonelli's theorem .  Statement of the lemma  Let ( X , || ||) be a Banach space and let ( u n ) n ∈ N be a sequence in X that converges weakly to some u 0 in X :        u  n   ⇀    u  0   as  n   →  ∞   .       normal-⇀   subscript  u  n      subscript  u  0   as  n     normal-→        u_{n}\rightharpoonup u_{0}\mbox{ as }n\to\infty.     That is, for every continuous linear functional  f in X ∗ , the continuous dual space of X ,        f   (   u  n   )    →   f   (   u  0   )   as  n   →  ∞   .       normal-→    f   subscript  u  n      f   subscript  u  0   as  n     normal-→        f(u_{n})\to f(u_{0})\mbox{ as }n\to\infty.     Then there exists a function N : N → N and a sequence of sets of real numbers      {   α    (  n  )   k    |   k  =   n  ,  …  ,   N   (  n  )      }     conditional-set    α   subscript  n  k      k   n  normal-…    N  n       \{\alpha(n)_{k}|k=n,\dots,N(n)\}     such that α ( n ) k ≥ 0 and        ∑   k  =  n    N   (  n  )      α    (  n  )   k     =  1        superscript   subscript     k  n      N  n      α   subscript  n  k     1    \sum_{k=n}^{N(n)}\alpha(n)_{k}=1     such that the sequence ( v n ) n ∈ N defined by the convex combination       v  n   =    ∑   k  =  n    N   (  n  )      α    (  n  )   k    u  k          subscript  v  n     superscript   subscript     k  n      N  n      α   subscript  n  k    subscript  u  k       v_{n}=\sum_{k=n}^{N(n)}\alpha(n)_{k}u_{k}     converges strongly in X to u 0 , i.e.        ∥    v  n   -   u  0    ∥   →   0  as  n   →  ∞   .       normal-→   norm     subscript  v  n    subscript  u  0       0  as  n     normal-→        \|v_{n}-u_{0}\|\to 0\mbox{ as }n\to\infty.
