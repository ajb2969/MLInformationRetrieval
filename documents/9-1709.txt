Mazur's lemma

In mathematics, Mazur's lemma is a result in the theory of Banach spaces. It shows that any weakly convergent sequence in a Banach space has a sequence of convex combinations of its members that converges strongly to the same limit, and is used in the proof of Tonelli's theorem.
Statement of the lemma
Let (X, || ||) be a Banach space and let (un)n∈N be a sequence in X that converges weakly to some u0 in X:



That is, for every continuous linear functional f in X∗, the continuous dual space of X,



Then there exists a function N : N → N and a sequence of sets of real numbers



such that α(n)k ≥ 0 and



such that the sequence (vn)n∈N defined by the convex combination



converges strongly in X to u0, i.e.
