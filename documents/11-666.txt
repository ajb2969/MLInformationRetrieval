ADP deaminase

In enzymology, an ADP deaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ADP + H2O 
 
 
 
  IDP + NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ADP and H2O, whereas its two products are IDP and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ADP aminohydrolase. Other names in common use include adenosine diphosphate deaminase, and adenosinepyrophosphate deaminase.
