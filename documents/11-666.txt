   ADP deaminase      ADP deaminase   In enzymology , an ADP deaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ADP + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   IDP + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ADP and H 2 O , whereas its two products are IDP and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ADP aminohydrolase . Other names in common use include adenosine diphosphate deaminase , and adenosinepyrophosphate deaminase .
