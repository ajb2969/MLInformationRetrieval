   Tryptophan—phenylpyruvate transaminase      Tryptophan—phenylpyruvate transaminase   In enzymology , a tryptophan-phenylpyruvate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-tryptophan + phenylpyruvate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (indol-3-yl)pyruvate + L-phenylalanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-tryptophan and phenylpyruvate , whereas its two products are (indol-3-yl)pyruvate and L-phenylalanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-tryptophan:phenylpyruvate aminotransferase . This enzyme is also called L-tryptophan-alpha-ketoisocaproate aminotransferase .
