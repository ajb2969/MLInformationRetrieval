}} In probability theory and statistics, the Lévy distribution, named after Paul Lévy, is a continuous probability distribution for a non-negative random variable. In spectroscopy, this distribution, with frequency as the dependent variable, is known as a van der Waals profile.1 It is a special case of the inverse-gamma distribution.
It is one of the few distributions that are stable and that have probability density functions that can be expressed analytically, the others being the normal distribution and the Cauchy distribution.
Definition
The probability density function of the Lévy distribution over the domain 
 
 
 
  is



where 
 
 
 
  is the location parameter and 
 
 
 
  is the scale parameter. The cumulative distribution function is



where 
 
 
 
  is the complementary error function. The shift parameter 
 
 
 
  has the effect of shifting the curve to the right by an amount 
 
 
 
 , and changing the support to the interval [
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 ). Like all stable distributions, the Levy distribution has a standard form f(x;0,1) which has the following property:



where y is defined as



The characteristic function of the Lévy distribution is given by



Note that the characteristic function can also be written in the same form used for the stable distribution with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 :



Assuming 
 
 
 
 , the nth moment of the unshifted Lévy distribution is formally defined by:



which diverges for all n > 0 so that the moments of the Lévy distribution do not exist. The moment generating function is then formally defined by:



which diverges for 
 
 
 
  and is therefore not defined in an interval around zero, so that the moment generating function is not defined per se. Like all stable distributions except the normal distribution, the wing of the probability density function exhibits heavy tail behavior falling off according to a power law:



This is illustrated in the diagram below, in which the probability density functions for various values of c and 
 
 
 
  are plotted on a log-log scale.

Random sample generation
Random samples from the Lévy distribution can be generated using inverse transform sampling. Given a random variate U drawn from the uniform distribution on the unit interval (0, 1], the variate X given by



is Lévy-distributed with location 
 
 
 
  and scale

Applications

The frequency of geomagnetic reversals appears to follow a Lévy distribution
The time of hitting a single point 
 
 
 
  (different from the starting point 0) by the Brownian motion has the Lévy distribution with 
 
 
 
 . (For a Brownian motion with drift, this time may follow an inverse Gaussian distribution, which has the Lévy distribution as a limit.)


The length of the path followed by a photon in a turbid medium follows the Lévy distribution.2


A Cauchy process can be defined as a Brownian motion subordinated to a process associated with a Lévy distribution.3
