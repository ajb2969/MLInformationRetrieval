   Collocation method      Collocation method   In mathematics, a collocation method is a method for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations , partial differential equations and integral equations . The idea is to choose a finite-dimensional space of candidate solutions (usually, polynomials up to a certain degree) and a number of points in the domain (called collocation points ), and to select that solution which satisfies the given equation at the collocation points.  Ordinary differential equations  Suppose that the ordinary differential equation          y  ′    (  t  )    =   f   (  t  ,   y   (  t  )    )     ,    y   (   t  0   )    =   y  0     ,     formulae-sequence       superscript  y  normal-′   t     f   t    y  t          y   subscript  t  0     subscript  y  0      y^{\prime}(t)=f(t,y(t)),\quad y(t_{0})=y_{0},   is to be solved over the interval [ t 0 , t 0 + h ]. Choose 0 ≤ c 1 2 n ≤ 1. The corresponding (polynomial) collocation method approximates the solution y by the polynomial p of degree n which satisfies the initial condition p ( t 0 ) = y 0 , and the differential equation p '( t ) = f ( t , p ( t )) at all points, called the collocation points,  t = t 0 + c k h where k = 1, …, n . This gives n + 1 conditions, which matches the n + 1 parameters needed to specify a polynomial of degree n .  All these collocation methods are in fact implicit Runge–Kutta methods . The coefficient c k in the Butcher tableau of a Runge–Kutta method are the collocation points. However, not all implicit Runge–Kutta methods are collocation methods. 1  Example: The trapezoidal rule  Pick, as an example, the two collocation points c 1 = 0 and c 2 = 1 (so n = 2). The collocation conditions are        p   (   t  0   )    =   y  0    ,        p   subscript  t  0     subscript  y  0     p(t_{0})=y_{0},\,            p  ′    (   t  0   )    =   f   (   t  0   ,   p   (   t  0   )    )     ,         superscript  p  normal-′    subscript  t  0      f    subscript  t  0     p   subscript  t  0        p^{\prime}(t_{0})=f(t_{0},p(t_{0})),\,            p  ′    (    t  0   +  h   )    =   f   (    t  0   +  h   ,   p   (    t  0   +  h   )    )     .         superscript  p  normal-′      subscript  t  0   h      f      subscript  t  0   h     p     subscript  t  0   h        p^{\prime}(t_{0}+h)=f(t_{0}+h,p(t_{0}+h)).\,     There are three conditions, so p should be a polynomial of degree 2. Write p in the form       p   (  t  )    =    α    (   t  -   t  0    )   2    +   β   (   t  -   t  0    )    +   γ          p  t       α   superscript    t   subscript  t  0    2      β    t   subscript  t  0     γ     p(t)=\alpha(t-t_{0})^{2}+\beta(t-t_{0})+\gamma\,     to simplify the computations. Then the collocation conditions can be solved to give the coefficients     α   α   \displaystyle\alpha     The collocation method is now given (implicitly) by        y  1   =   p   (    t  0   +  h   )    =    y  0   +    1  2   h   (    f   (    t  0   +  h   ,   y  1   )    +   f   (   t  0   ,   y  0   )     )      ,         subscript  y  1     p     subscript  t  0   h            subscript  y  0       1  2   h      f      subscript  t  0   h    subscript  y  1       f    subscript  t  0    subscript  y  0           y_{1}=p(t_{0}+h)=y_{0}+\frac{1}{2}h\Big(f(t_{0}+h,y_{1})+f(t_{0},y_{0})\Big),\,     where y 1 = p ( t 0 + h ) is the approximate solution at t = t 0 + h .  This method is known as the " trapezoidal rule " for differential equations. Indeed, this method can also be derived by rewriting the differential equation as        y   (  t  )    =    y   (   t  0   )    +    ∫   t  0   t    f   (  τ  ,   y   (  τ  )    )   d  τ      ,        y  t       y   subscript  t  0      superscript   subscript    subscript  t  0    t     f   τ    y  τ    d  τ       y(t)=y(t_{0})+\int_{t_{0}}^{t}f(\tau,y(\tau))\,\textrm{d}\tau,\,     and approximating the integral on the right-hand side by the trapezoidal rule for integrals.  Other examples  The Gauss–Legendre methods uses the points of Gauss–Legendre quadrature as collocation points. The Gauss–Legendre method based on s points has order 2 s . 2 All Gauss–Legendre methods are A-stable . 3  In fact, one can show that the order of a collocation method corresponds to the order of the quadrature rule that one would get using the collocation points as weights.
