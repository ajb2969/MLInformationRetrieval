Resistance force

In physics, resistance force is the force which an effort force must overcome in order to do work on an object via a simple machine. Resistance force, like most other forces, is measured in newtons or in pounds-force.
For an ideal (frictionless) mechanism in which no energy is lost, resistance force obeys the relation:



where:

R equals resistance force
 
DR equals resistance distance

E equals effort force

DE equals effort distance


Resistance force is used to calculate the work output using the following equation:
