Giraud subcategory

In mathematics, Giraud subcategories form an important class of subcategories of Grothendieck categories. They are named after Jean Giraud.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a Grothendieck category. A full subcategory 
 
 
 
  is called reflective, if the inclusion functor 
 
 
 
  has a left adjoint. If 
 
 
 
  additionally preserves kernels, then 
 
 
 
  is called a Giraud subcategory.
Properties
Let 
 
 
 
  be Giraud in the Grothendieck category 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the inclusion functor.



 
  is again a Grothendieck category.
An object 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is injective if and only if 
 
 
 
  is injective in 
 
 
 
 .
The left adjoint 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is exact.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a localizing subcategory of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be the associated quotient category. The section functor 
 
 
 
  is fully faithful and induces an equivalence between 
 
 
 
  and the Giraud subcategory 
 
 
 
  given by the 
 
 
 
 -closed objects in 
 
 
 
 .
