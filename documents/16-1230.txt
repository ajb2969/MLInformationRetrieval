   Weak Büchi automaton      Weak Büchi automaton   In automata theory , a Weak Büchi automaton is a variant of Büchi automaton . A Büchi automaton is weak if for all pair of states   q   q   q   and    q  ′     superscript  q  normal-′    q^{\prime}   belonging to the same strongly connected component, either both   q   q   q   and    q  ′     superscript  q  normal-′    q^{\prime}   are accepting, or both   q   q   q   and    q  ′     superscript  q  normal-′    q^{\prime}   are rejecting.  A Büchi automaton accepts a word   w   w   w   if there exists a run, such that at least one state occurring infinitely often in the final state set   F   F   F   . For Weak Büchi automata, this condition is equivalent to the existence of a run which ultimately stays in the set of accepting states.  Weak Büchi automata are strictly weaker than Büchi automaton and than Co-Büchi automaton .  Properties  Weak Büchi automata are equivalent to deterministic Weak Büchi automata. The determinization algorithm have exponential time. The deterministic Weak Büchi automata can be minimized in time    O   (   n   log   (  n  )     )       O    n    n      O(n\log(n))   .  Weak Büchi automata are closed under union, intersection and complementation.  References     "  Category:Automata theory
