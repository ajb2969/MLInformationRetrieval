Weak Büchi automaton

In automata theory, a Weak Büchi automaton is a variant of Büchi automaton. A Büchi automaton is weak if for all pair of states 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  belonging to the same strongly connected component, either both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are accepting, or both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are rejecting.
A Büchi automaton accepts a word 
 
 
 
  if there exists a run, such that at least one state occurring infinitely often in the final state set 
 
 
 
 . For Weak Büchi automata, this condition is equivalent to the existence of a run which ultimately stays in the set of accepting states.
Weak Büchi automata are strictly weaker than Büchi automaton and than Co-Büchi automaton.
Properties
Weak Büchi automata are equivalent to deterministic Weak Büchi automata. The determinization algorithm have exponential time. The deterministic Weak Büchi automata can be minimized in time 
 
 
 
 .
Weak Büchi automata are closed under union, intersection and complementation.
