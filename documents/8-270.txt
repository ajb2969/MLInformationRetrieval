In mathematics, the Riemann Xi function is a variant of the Riemann zeta function, and is defined so as to have a particularly simple functional equation. The function is named in honour of Bernhard Riemann.
Definition
Riemann's original lower-case xi-function, ξ, has been renamed with an upper-case Xi, Ξ, by Edmund Landau (see below). Landau's lower-case xi, ξ, is defined as:1


 
  for 
 
 
 
 . Here ζ(s) denotes the Riemann zeta function and Γ(s) is the Gamma function. The functional equation (or reflection formula) for xi is


 
  The upper-case Xi, Ξ, is defined by Landau (loc. cit., §71) as


 
  and obeys the functional equation


 
  As reported by Landau (loc. cit., p. 894) this function Ξ is the function Riemann originally denoted by ξ.
Values
The general form for even integers is



where Bn denotes the n-th Bernoulli number. For example:



Series representations
The 
 
 
 
  function has the series expansion



where



where the sum extends over ρ, the non-trivial zeros of the zeta function, in order of 
 
 
 
 .
This expansion plays a particularly important role in Li's criterion, which states that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to having λn > 0 for all positive n.
Hadamard product
A simple infinite product expansion is


 
  where ρ ranges over the roots of ξ.
To ensure convergence in the expansion, the product should be taken over "matching pairs" of zeroes, i.e., the factors for a pair of zeroes of the form ρ and 1−ρ should be grouped together.
