Szegő limit theorems

In mathematical analysis, the Szegő limit theorems describe the asymptotic behaviour of the determinants of large Toeplitz matrices.12 They were first proved by Gábor Szegő.
Notation
Let φ : T→C be a complex function ("symbol") on the unit circle. Consider the n×n Toeplitz matrices Tn(φ), defined by



where



are the Fourier coefficients of φ.
First Szegő theorem
The first Szegő theorem34 states that, if φ > 0 and φ ∈ L1(T), then




The right-hand side of () is the geometric mean of φ (well-defined by the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality).
Second Szegő theorem
Denote the right-hand side of () by Gn. The second (or strong) Szegő theorem56 asserts that if, in addition, the derivative of φ is Hölder continuous of order α > 0, then
