Deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase

In enzymology, a deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2-deoxy-D-ribose 5-phosphate 
 
 
 
  D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + acetaldehyde
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 2-deoxy-D-ribose 5-phosphate, and two products, D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and acetaldehyde.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-deoxy-D-ribose-5-phosphate acetaldehyde-lyase (D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-forming). Other names in common use include phosphodeoxyriboaldolase, deoxyriboaldolase, deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase, 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase, and 2-deoxy-D-ribose-5-phosphate acetaldehyde-lyase. This enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway.
