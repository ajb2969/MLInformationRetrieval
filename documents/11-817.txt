   1-alkyl-2-acetylglycerol O-acyltransferase      1-alkyl-2-acetylglycerol O-acyltransferase   In enzymology , a 1-alkyl-2-acetylglycerol O-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acyl-CoA + 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-3-acyl-sn-glycerol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol , whereas its two products are CoA and 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-3-acyl-sn-glycerol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol O-acyltransferase . This enzyme is also called 1-hexadecyl-2-acetylglycerol acyltransferase . This enzyme participates in ether lipid metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
