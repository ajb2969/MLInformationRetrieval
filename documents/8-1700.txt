   Non-logical symbol      Non-logical symbol   In logic , the formal languages used to create expressions consist of symbols , which can be broadly divided into constants and variables . The constants of a language can further be divided into logical symbols and non-logical symbols (sometimes also called logical and non-logical constants ).  The non-logical symbols of a language of first-order logic consist of predicates and individual constants . These include symbols that, in an interpretation, may stand for individual constants , variables , functions , or predicates . A language of first-order logic is a formal language over the alphabet consisting of its non-logical symbols and its logical symbols . The latter include logical connectives , quantifiers , and variables that stand for statements .  A non-logical symbol only has meaning or semantic content when one is assigned to it by means of an interpretation . Consequently, a sentence containing a non-logical symbol lacks meaning except under an interpretation, so a sentence is said to be true or false under an interpretation . Main article: first order logic especially Syntax of first-order logic  The logical constants , by contrast, have the same meaning in all interpretations. They include the symbols for truth-functional connectives (such as and, or, not, implies, and logical equivalence ) and the symbols for the quantifiers "for all" and "there exists".  The equality symbol is sometimes treated as a non-logical symbol and sometimes treated as a symbol of logic. If it is treated as a logical symbol, then any interpretation will be required to interpret the equality sign using true equality; if interpreted as a non-logical symbol, it may be interpreted by an arbitrary equivalence relation.  Signatures  A signature is a set of non-logical constants together with additional information identifying each symbol as either a constant symbol, or a function symbol of a specific arity  n (a natural number), or a relation symbol of a specific arity. The additional information controls how the non-logical symbols can be used to form terms and formulas. For instance if f is a binary function symbol and c is a constant symbol, then f ( x , c ) is a term, but c ( x , f ) is not a term. Relation symbols cannot be used in terms, but they can be used to combine one or more (depending on the arity) terms into an atomic formula.  For example a signature could consist of a binary function symbol +, a constant symbol 0, and a binary relation symbol <. a="" also="" an="" and="" as="" by="" consists="" constant="" discourse="" element="" every="" function="" i.e.="" interpretation="" interpretations="" interpreted="" is="" it.="" known="" language="" logic="" non-logical="" of="" on="" over="" provide="" semantics="" set="" signature="" structure="" symbol="" symbols:="" the="" to="" together="" with="">n → D'' from the n -fold cartesian product of the domain to the domain itself. Every n -ary relation symbol is interpreted by an n -ary relation on the domain, i.e. by a subset of D n . .  An example of a structure over the signature mentioned above is the ordered group of integers . Its domain is the set   ℤ   ℤ   {\mathbb{Z}}   = {…, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, …} of integers. The binary function symbol + is interpreted by addition, the constant symbol 0 by the additive identity, and the binary relation symbol Carnap, Rudolf, Introduction to Symbolic Logic and its Applications.
