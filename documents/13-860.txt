Adjoint state method

The adjoint state method is a numerical method for efficiently computing the gradient of a function or operator in a numerical optimization problem. It has applications in geophysics and seismic imaging.
The adjoint state space is chosen to simplify the physical interpretation of equation constraints.1 It may take the form of a Hilbert space.
Adjoint state techniques allow the use of integration by parts, resulting in a form which explicitly contains the physically interesting quantity. An adjoint state equation is introduced, including a new unknown variable.
The adjoint method is derived from the dual problem 1 and is used i.e. in the landweber iteration method2.
The name adjoint state method refers to the  dual form of the problem. Where the adjoint matrix

 
  is used.(When non-complex 
 
 
 
 ) When the primal problem consists of calculating 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
 , then the dual problem can be written as calculating 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
  in which 
 
 
 
  is the adjoint matrix of the matrix 
 
 
 
 . And 
 
 
 
  is called the adjoint state vector.
