   Adjoint state method      Adjoint state method   The adjoint state method is a numerical method for efficiently computing the gradient of a function or operator in a numerical optimization problem. It has applications in geophysics and seismic imaging .  The adjoint state space is chosen to simplify the physical interpretation of equation constraints . 1 It may take the form of a Hilbert space .  Adjoint state techniques allow the use of integration by parts , resulting in a form which explicitly contains the physically interesting quantity. An adjoint state equation is introduced, including a new unknown variable.  The adjoint method is derived from the dual problem  1 and is used i.e. in the landweber iteration method 2 .  The name adjoint state method refers to the dual form of the problem. Where the adjoint matrix     A  *     superscript  A     A^{*}   is used.(When non-complex     A  *   =  =   A  T      fragments   superscript  A       superscript  A  T     A^{*}==A^{T}   ) When the primal problem consists of calculating     s  t   x       superscript  s  t   x    s^{t}x   so that     A  x   =  b        A  x   b    Ax=b   , then the dual problem can be written as calculating     r  t   b       superscript  r  t   b    r^{t}b   so that      A  *   r   =  s         superscript  A    r   s    A^{*}r=s   in which    A  *     superscript  A     A^{*}   is the adjoint matrix of the matrix   A   A   A   . And   r   r   r   is called the adjoint state vector.  External Links  A well written explanation by Errico: What is an adjoint Model?
