Genus–degree formula




Genus–degree formula

In classical algebraic geometry, the genus–degree formula relates the degree d of an irreducible plane curve 
 
 
 
  with its arithmetic genus g via the formula:



If the curve is non-singular the geometric genus and the arithmetic genus are equal, but if the curve is singular, with only ordinary singularities, the geometric genus is smaller. More precisely, an ordinary singularity of multiplicity r decreases the genus by 
 
 
 
 .1
Proof
The proof follows immediately from the adjunction formula. For a classical proof see the book of Arbarello, Cornalba, Griffiths and Harris.
Generalization
For a non-singular hypersurface

 
 
  of degree d in 
 
 
 
  of arithmetic genus g the formula becomes:



where 
 
 
 
  is the binomial coefficient.
