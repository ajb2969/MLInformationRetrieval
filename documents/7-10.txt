   Fatou–Lebesgue theorem      Fatou–Lebesgue theorem   In mathematics , the Fatou–Lebesgue theorem establishes a chain of inequalities relating the integrals (in the sense of Lebesgue ) of the limit inferior and the limit superior of a sequence of functions to the limit inferior and the limit superior of integrals of these functions. The theorem is named after Pierre Fatou and Henri Léon Lebesgue .  If the sequence of functions converges pointwise , the inequalities turn into equalities and the theorem reduces to Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem .  Statement of the theorem  Let f 1 , f 2 , ... denote a sequence of real -valued measurable functions defined on a measure space ( S , Σ , μ ). If there exists a Lebesgue-integrable function g on S which dominates the sequence in absolute value, meaning that | f n | ≤ g for all natural numbers  n , then all f n as well as the limit inferior and the limit superior of the f n are integrable and         ∫  S     lim inf   n  →  ∞       f  n    d  μ     ≤    lim inf   n  →  ∞      ∫  S      f  n    d  μ     ≤    lim sup   n  →  ∞      ∫  S      f  n    d  μ     ≤    ∫  S     lim sup   n  →  ∞       f  n    d   μ       .          subscript   S     subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n        subscript  f  n   d  μ       subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n       subscript   S      subscript  f  n   d  μ            subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n       subscript   S      subscript  f  n   d  μ            subscript   S     subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n        subscript  f  n   d  μ        \int_{S}\liminf_{n\to\infty}f_{n}\,d\mu\leq\liminf_{n\to\infty}\int_{S}f_{n}\,%

 }f_{n}\,d\mu\,.   Here the limit inferior and the limit superior of the f n are taken pointwise. The integral of the absolute value of these limiting functions is bounded above by the integral of g .  Since the middle inequality (for sequences of real numbers) is always true, the directions of the other inequalities are easy to remember.  Proof  All f n as well as the limit inferior and the limit superior of the f n are measurable and dominated in absolute value by g , hence integrable.  The first inequality follows by applying Fatou's lemma to the non-negative functions f n + g and using the linearity of the Lebesgue integral . The last inequality is the reverse Fatou lemma .  Since g also dominates the limit superior of the | f n |,      0  ≤   |    ∫  S     lim inf   n  →  ∞       f  n    d  μ     |   ≤    ∫  S     |    lim inf   n  →  ∞     f  n    |   d  μ    ≤    ∫  S     lim sup   n  →  ∞      |   f  n   |   d  μ     ≤    ∫  S     g   d  μ          0      subscript   S     subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n        subscript  f  n   d  μ             subscript   S         subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n      subscript  f  n     d  μ           subscript   S     subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n          subscript  f  n    d  μ            subscript   S     g  d  μ       0\leq\biggl|\int_{S}\liminf_{n\to\infty}f_{n}\,d\mu\biggr|\leq\int_{S}\Bigl|%
