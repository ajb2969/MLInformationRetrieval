   Gamma-glutamyl-gamma-aminobutyrate hydrolase      Gamma-glutamyl-gamma-aminobutyrate hydrolase   In enzymology , a gamma-glutamyl-gamma-aminobutyrate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-(gamma-glutamylamino)butanoate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-aminobutanoate + L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-(gamma-glutamylamino)butanoate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 4-aminobutanoate and L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-(gamma-glutamylamino)butanoate amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include gamma-glutamyl-GABA hydrolase , PuuD , and YcjL . This enzyme participates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
