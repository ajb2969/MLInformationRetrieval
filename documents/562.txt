   De Bruijn graph      De Bruijn graph   In graph theory , an n -dimensional De Bruijn graph of m symbols is a directed graph representing overlaps between sequences of symbols. It has m n  vertices , consisting of all possible length- n sequences of the given symbols; the same symbol may appear multiple times in a sequence. If we have the set of m symbols    S  :=   {   s  1   ,  …  ,   s  m   }      assign  S    subscript  s  1   normal-…   subscript  s  m      S:=\{s_{1},\dots,s_{m}\}   then the set of vertices is:       V  =   S  n   =   {   (   s  1   ,  …  ,   s  1   ,   s  1   )   ,   (   s  1   ,  …  ,   s  1   ,   s  2   )   ,  …  ,   (   s  1   ,  …  ,   s  1   ,   s  m   )   ,   (   s  1   ,  …  ,   s  2   ,   s  1   )   ,  …  ,   (   s  m   ,  …  ,   s  m   ,   s  m   )   }    .        V   superscript  S  n           subscript  s  1   normal-…   subscript  s  1    subscript  s  1      subscript  s  1   normal-…   subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2    normal-…    subscript  s  1   normal-…   subscript  s  1    subscript  s  m      subscript  s  1   normal-…   subscript  s  2    subscript  s  1    normal-…    subscript  s  m   normal-…   subscript  s  m    subscript  s  m        V=S^{n}=\{(s_{1},\dots,s_{1},s_{1}),(s_{1},\dots,s_{1},s_{2}),\dots,(s_{1},%
 \dots,s_{1},s_{m}),(s_{1},\dots,s_{2},s_{1}),\dots,(s_{m},\dots,s_{m},s_{m})\}.     If one of the vertices can be expressed as another vertex by shifting all its symbols by one place to the left and adding a new symbol at the end of this vertex, then the latter has a directed edge to the former vertex. Thus the set of arcs (aka directed edges) is       E  =   {   (   (   v  1   ,   v  2   ,  …  ,   v  n   )   ,   (   v  2   ,  …  ,   v  n   ,   s  i   )   )   :   i  =   1  ,  …  ,  m    }    .      E   conditional-set     subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2   normal-…   subscript  v  n      subscript  v  2   normal-…   subscript  v  n    subscript  s  i       i   1  normal-…  m       E=\{((v_{1},v_{2},\dots,v_{n}),(v_{2},\dots,v_{n},s_{i})):i=1,\dots,m\}.     Although De Bruijn graphs are named after Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn , they were discovered independently by both De Bruijn 1 and I. J. Good . 2 Much earlier, Camille Flye Sainte-Marie 3 implicitly used their properties.  Properties   If    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   then the condition for any two vertices forming an edge holds vacuously, and hence all the vertices are connected forming a total of    m  2     superscript  m  2    m^{2}   edges.  Each vertex has exactly   m   m   m   incoming and   m   m   m   outgoing edges.  Each   n   n   n   -dimensional De Bruijn graph is the line digraph of the    (   n  -  1   )      n  1    (n-1)   -dimensional De Bruijn graph with the same set of symbols. 4  Each De Bruijn graph is Eulerian and Hamiltonian . The Euler cycles and Hamiltonian cycles of these graphs (equivalent to each other via the line graph construction) are De Bruijn sequences .   The line graph construction of the three smallest binary De Bruijn graphs is depicted below. As can be seen in the illustration, each vertex of the   n   n   n   -dimensional De Bruijn graph corresponds to an edge of the    (   n  -  1   )      n  1    (n-1)   -dimensional De Bruijn graph, and each edge in the   n   n   n   -dimensional De Bruijn graph corresponds to a two-edge path in the    (   n  -  1   )      n  1    (n-1)   -dimensional De Bruijn graph.  Dynamical systems  Binary De Bruijn graphs can be drawn (below, left) in such a way that they resemble objects from the theory of dynamical systems , such as the Lorenz attractor (below, right):         This analogy can be made rigorous: the n -dimensional m -symbol De Bruijn graph is a model of the Bernoulli map      x  ↦    m   x    mod  1      maps-to  x   modulo    m  x   1     x\mapsto mx\ \bmod\ 1     The Bernoulli map (also called the 2x mod 1 map for m = 2) is an ergodic dynamical system, which can be understood to be a single shift of a m-adic number . 5 The trajectories of this dynamical system correspond to walks in the De Bruijn graph, where the correspondence is given by mapping each real x in the interval [0,1) to the vertex corresponding to the first n digits in the base - m representation of x . Equivalently, walks in the De Bruijn graph correspond to trajectories in a one-sided subshift of finite type .  Uses   Some grid network topologies are De Bruijn graphs.  The distributed hash table protocol Koorde uses a De Bruijn graph.  In bioinformatics , De Bruijn graphs are used for de novo assembly of (short) read sequences into a genome . 6 7 8 9   See also   De Bruijn sequence  De Bruijn torus  Hamming graph  Kautz graph   References   10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18   External links    [ http://www.homolog.us/Tutorials/index.php?p=2.1&s; ;=1 Tutorial on using De Bruijn Graphs in Bioinformatics] by Homolog.us   "  Category:Dynamical systems  Category:Automata theory  Category:Parametric families of graphs  Category:Directed graphs              ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
