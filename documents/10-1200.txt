   D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase      D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase   In enzymology , a D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-arabinono-1,4-lactone + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-erythro-ascorbate + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-arabinono-1,4-lactone and O 2 , whereas its two products are D-erythro-ascorbate and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-arabinono-1,4-lactone:oxygen oxidoreductase . It employs one cofactor , FAD .
