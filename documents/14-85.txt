Heptacontagon

In geometry, a heptacontagon (or hebdomecontagon from Ancient Greek ἑβδομήκοντα, seventy1) is a seventy-sided polygon.23 The sum of any heptacontagon's interior angles is 12240 degrees.
A regular heptacontagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {70} and can also be constructed as a quasiregular truncated 35-gon, t{35}, which alternates two types of edges.
Regular heptacontagon properties
One interior angle in a regular heptacontagon is 174
 
 
 
 °, meaning that one exterior angle would be 5
 
 
 
 °.
The area of a regular heptacontagon is (with )



and its inradius is



The circumradius of a regular heptacontagon is



A regular heptacontagon is not constructible using a compass and straightedge,4 but is constructible if the use of an angle trisector is allowed.5
Heptacontagram
A heptacontagram is a 70-sided star polygon. There are 11 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols {70/3}, {70/9}, {70/11}, {70/13}, {70/17}, {70/19}, {70/23}, {70/27}, {70/29}, {70/31}, and {70/33}, as well as 23 regular star figures with the same vertex configuration.
