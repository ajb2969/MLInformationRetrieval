   Heptacontagon      Heptacontagon   In geometry , a heptacontagon (or hebdomecontagon from Ancient Greek ἑβδομήκοντα, seventy 1 ) is a seventy-sided polygon . 2 3 The sum of any heptacontagon's interior angles is 12240 degrees.  A regular heptacontagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {70} and can also be constructed as a quasiregular truncated 35-gon, t{35}, which alternates two types of edges.  Regular heptacontagon properties  One interior angle in a regular heptacontagon is 174    6  /  7      6  7    {6}/{7}   °, meaning that one exterior angle would be 5    1  /  7      1  7    {1}/{7}   °.  The area of a regular heptacontagon is (with )      A  =    35  2    t  2    cot   π  70         A      35  2    superscript  t  2       π  70       A=\frac{35}{2}t^{2}\cot\frac{\pi}{70}     and its inradius is      r  =    1  2   t   cot   π  70         r      1  2   t      π  70       r=\frac{1}{2}t\cot\frac{\pi}{70}     The circumradius of a regular heptacontagon is      R  =    1  2   t   csc   π  70         R      1  2   t      π  70       R=\frac{1}{2}t\csc\frac{\pi}{70}     A regular heptacontagon is not constructible using a compass and straightedge , 4 but is constructible if the use of an angle trisector is allowed. 5  Heptacontagram  A heptacontagram is a 70-sided star polygon . There are 11 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols {70/3}, {70/9}, {70/11}, {70/13}, {70/17}, {70/19}, {70/23}, {70/27}, {70/29}, {70/31}, and {70/33}, as well as 23 regular star figures with the same vertex configuration .
