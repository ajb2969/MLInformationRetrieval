   Poisson manifold      Poisson manifold   A Poisson structure on a smooth manifold    M   M   M   is a Lie bracket     {  ⋅  ,  ⋅  }     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    \{\cdot,\cdot\}   (called a Poisson bracket in this special case) on the algebra     C  ∞    (  M  )        superscript  C    M    {C^{\infty}}(M)   of smooth functions on   M   M   M   , subject to the Leibniz Rule       {   f  g   ,  h  }   =    f   {  g  ,  h  }    +   g   {  f  ,  h  }            f  g   h       f   g  h      g   f  h       \{fg,h\}=f\{g,h\}+g\{f,h\}   .  Said in another manner, it is a Lie-algebra structure on the vector space of smooth functions on   M   M   M   such that      X  f    =  df    {  f  ,  ⋅  }    :     C  ∞    (  M  )    →    C  ∞    (  M  )        normal-:    superscript   df    subscript  X  f    f  normal-⋅     normal-→     superscript  C    M      superscript  C    M      X_{f}\stackrel{\text{df}}{=}\{f,\cdot\}:{C^{\infty}}(M)\to{C^{\infty}}(M)   is a vector field for each smooth function   f   f   f   , which we call the Hamiltonian vector field associated to   f   f   f   . These vector fields span a completely integrable singular foliation, each of whose maximal integral sub-manifolds inherits a symplectic structure. One may thus informally view a Poisson structure on a smooth manifold as a smooth partition of the ambient manifold into even-dimensional symplectic leaves , which are not necessarily of the same dimension.  Poisson structures are one instance of Jacobi structures , introduced by André Lichnerowicz in 1977. 1 They were further studied in the classical paper of Alan Weinstein , 2 where many basic structure theorems were first proved, and which exerted a huge influence on the development of Poisson geometry — which today is deeply entangled with non-commutative geometry, integrable systems, topological field theories and representation theory, to name a few.  Definition  Let   M   M   M   be a smooth manifold. Let     C  ∞    (  M  )        superscript  C    M    {C^{\infty}}(M)   denote the real algebra of smooth real-valued functions on   M   M   M   , where multiplication is defined pointwise. A Poisson bracket (or Poisson structure ) on   M   M   M   is an   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   -bilinear map       {  ⋅  ,  ⋅  }   :       C  ∞    (  M  )    ×   C  ∞     (  M  )    →    C  ∞    (  M  )        normal-:   normal-⋅  normal-⋅    normal-→         superscript  C    M    superscript  C     M      superscript  C    M      \{\cdot,\cdot\}:{C^{\infty}}(M)\times{C^{\infty}}(M)\to{C^{\infty}}(M)     satisfying the following three conditions:   Skew symmetry      {  f  ,  g  }   =   -   {  g  ,  f  }         f  g      g  f      \{f,g\}=-\{g,f\}   .  Jacobi identity       {  f  ,   {  g  ,  h  }   }   +   {  g  ,   {  h  ,  f  }   }   +   {  h  ,   {  f  ,  g  }   }    =  0         f   g  h     g   h  f     h   f  g     0    \{f,\{g,h\}\}+\{g,\{h,f\}\}+\{h,\{f,g\}\}=0   .  Leibniz's Rule      {   f  g   ,  h  }   =    f   {  g  ,  h  }    +   g   {  f  ,  h  }            f  g   h       f   g  h      g   f  h       \{fg,h\}=f\{g,h\}+g\{f,h\}   .   The first two conditions ensure that    {  ⋅  ,  ⋅  }     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    \{\cdot,\cdot\}   defines a Lie-algebra structure on     C  ∞    (  M  )        superscript  C    M    {C^{\infty}}(M)   , while the third guarantees that for each    f  ∈    C  ∞    (  M  )        f     superscript  C    M     f\in{C^{\infty}}(M)   , the adjoint     {  f  ,  ⋅  }   :     C  ∞    (  M  )    →    C  ∞    (  M  )        normal-:   f  normal-⋅    normal-→     superscript  C    M      superscript  C    M      \{f,\cdot\}:{C^{\infty}}(M)\to{C^{\infty}}(M)   is a derivation of the commutative product on     C  ∞    (  M  )        superscript  C    M    {C^{\infty}}(M)   , i.e., is a vector field    X  f     subscript  X  f    X_{f}   . It follows that the bracket    {  f  ,  g  }     f  g    \{f,g\}   of functions   f   f   f   and   g   g   g   is of the form     {  f  ,  g  }   =   π   (    d  f   ∧   d  g    )         f  g     π      d  f     d  g       \{f,g\}=\pi(df\wedge dg)   , where    π  ∈   Γ   (    ⋀  2    T  M    )        π    normal-Γ    superscript   2     T  M       \pi\in\Gamma\left(\bigwedge^{2}TM\right)   is a smooth bi-vector field.  Conversely, given any smooth bi-vector field   π   π   \pi   on   M   M   M   , the formula     {  f  ,  g  }   =   π   (    d  f   ∧   d  g    )         f  g     π      d  f     d  g       \{f,g\}=\pi(df\wedge dg)   defines a bilinear skew-symmetric bracket    {  ⋅  ,  ⋅  }     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    \{\cdot,\cdot\}   that automatically obeys Leibniz's rule. The condition that the ensuing    {  ⋅  ,  ⋅  }     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    \{\cdot,\cdot\}   be a Poisson bracket — i.e., satisfy the Jacobi identity — can be characterized by the non-linear partial differential equation     [  π  ,  π  ]   =  0       π  π   0    [\pi,\pi]=0   , where       [  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ]   :       𝔛  p    (  M  )    ×   𝔛  q     (  M  )    →    𝔛   p  +  q     (  M  )        normal-:   normal-⋅  normal-⋅    normal-→         superscript  𝔛  p   M    superscript  𝔛  q    M      superscript  𝔛    p  q    M      [\cdot,\cdot]:{\mathfrak{X}^{p}}(M)\times{\mathfrak{X}^{q}}(M)\to{\mathfrak{X}%
 ^{p+q}}(M)     denotes the Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket on multi-vector fields. It is customary and convenient to switch between the bracket and the bi-vector points of view, and we shall do so below.  Symplectic Leaves  A Poisson manifold is naturally partitioned into regularly immersed symplectic manifolds, called its symplectic leaves .  Note that a bi-vector field can be regarded as a skew homomorphism     π  ♯   :     T  *   M   →   T  M       normal-:   superscript  π  normal-♯    normal-→     superscript  T    M     T  M      \pi^{\sharp}:T^{*}M\to TM   . The rank of   π   π   \pi   at a point    x  ∈  M      x  M    x\in M   is then the rank of the induced linear mapping    π  x  ♯     subscript   superscript  π  normal-♯   x    \pi^{\sharp}_{x}   . Its image consists of the values     X  f    (  x  )        subscript  X  f   x    {X_{f}}(x)   of all Hamiltonian vector fields evaluated at   x   x   x   . A point    x  ∈  M      x  M    x\in M   is called regular for a Poisson structure   π   π   \pi   on   M   M   M   if and only if the rank of   π   π   \pi   is constant on an open neighborhood of    x  ∈  M      x  M    x\in M   ; otherwise, it is called a singular point . Regular points form an open dense subspace     M  reg   ⊆  M       subscript  M  reg   M    M_{\mathrm{reg}}\subseteq M   ; when     M  reg   =  M       subscript  M  reg   M    M_{\mathrm{reg}}=M   , we call the Poisson structure itself regular .  An integral sub-manifold for the (singular) distribution     π  ♯    (    T  *   M   )        superscript  π  normal-♯      superscript  T    M     {\pi^{\sharp}}(T^{*}M)   is a path-connected sub-manifold    S  ⊆  M      S  M    S\subseteq M   satisfying      T  x   S   =    π  ♯    (    T  x  ∗   M   )           subscript  T  x   S      superscript  π  normal-♯      subscript   superscript  T  normal-∗   x   M      T_{x}S={\pi^{\sharp}}(T^{\ast}_{x}M)   for all    x  ∈  S      x  S    x\in S   . Integral sub-manifolds of   π   π   \pi   are automatically regularly immersed manifolds, and maximal integral sub-manifolds of   π   π   \pi   are called the leaves of   π   π   \pi   . Each leaf   S   S   S   carries a natural symplectic form     ω  S   ∈    Ω  2    (  S  )         subscript  ω  S      superscript  normal-Ω  2   S     \omega_{S}\in{\Omega^{2}}(S)   determined by the condition      [    ω  S    (   X  f   ,   X  g   )    ]    (  x  )    =   -    {  f  ,  g  }    (  x  )            delimited-[]     subscript  ω  S     subscript  X  f    subscript  X  g      x        f  g   x      [{\omega_{S}}(X_{f},X_{g})](x)=-\{f,g\}(x)   for all     f  ,  g   ∈    C  ∞    (  M  )         f  g      superscript  C    M     f,g\in{C^{\infty}}(M)   and    x  ∈  S      x  S    x\in S   . Correspondingly, one speaks of the symplectic leaves of   π   π   \pi   . 3 Moreover, both the space    M  reg     subscript  M  reg    M_{\mathrm{reg}}   of regular points and its complement are saturated by symplectic leaves, so symplectic leaves may be either regular or singular .  Examples   Every manifold   M   M   M   carries the trivial Poisson structure     {  f  ,  g  }   =  0       f  g   0    \{f,g\}=0   .  Every symplectic manifold    (  M  ,  ω  )     M  ω    (M,\omega)   is Poisson, with the Poisson bi-vector   π   π   \pi   equal to the inverse    ω   -  1      superscript  ω    1     \omega^{-1}   of the symplectic form   ω   ω   \omega   .  The dual    𝔤  *     superscript  𝔤     \mathfrak{g}^{*}   of a Lie algebra    (  𝔤  ,   [  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ]   )     𝔤   normal-⋅  normal-⋅     (\mathfrak{g},[\cdot,\cdot])   is a Poisson manifold. A coordinate-free description can be given as follows   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   naturally sits inside     C  ∞    (   𝔤  *   )        superscript  C     superscript  𝔤      {C^{\infty}}(\mathfrak{g}^{*})   , and the rule     {  X  ,  Y  }    =  df    [  X  ,  Y  ]       superscript   df    X  Y    X  Y     \{X,Y\}\stackrel{\text{df}}{=}[X,Y]   for each     X  ,  Y   ∈  𝔤       X  Y   𝔤    X,Y\in\mathfrak{g}   induces a linear Poisson structure on    𝔤  *     superscript  𝔤     \mathfrak{g}^{*}   , i.e., one for which the bracket of linear functions is again linear. Conversely, any linear Poisson structure must be of this form.  Let   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   be a (regular) foliation of dimension    2  r      2  r    2r   on   M   M   M   and    ω  ∈    Ω  2    (  ℱ  )        ω     superscript  normal-Ω  2   ℱ     \omega\in{\Omega^{2}}(\mathcal{F})   a closed foliation two-form for which    ω  r     superscript  ω  r    \omega^{r}   is nowhere-vanishing. This uniquely determines a regular Poisson structure on   M   M   M   by requiring that the symplectic leaves of   π   π   \pi   be the leaves   S   S   S   of   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   equipped with the induced symplectic form     ω  |   S     evaluated-at  ω  S    \omega|_{S}   .   Poisson Maps  If    (  M  ,    {  ⋅  ,  ⋅  }   M   )     M   subscript   normal-⋅  normal-⋅   M     (M,\{\cdot,\cdot\}_{M})   and    (   M  ′   ,    {  ⋅  ,  ⋅  }    M  ′    )      superscript  M  normal-′    subscript   normal-⋅  normal-⋅    superscript  M  normal-′      (M^{\prime},\{\cdot,\cdot\}_{M^{\prime}})   are two Poisson manifolds, then a smooth mapping    φ  :   M  →   M  ′       normal-:  φ   normal-→  M   superscript  M  normal-′      \varphi:M\to M^{\prime}   is called a Poisson map if it respects the Poisson structures, namely, if for all    x  ∈  M      x  M    x\in M   and smooth functions     f  ,  g   ∈    C  ∞    (   M  ′   )         f  g      superscript  C     superscript  M  normal-′      f,g\in{C^{\infty}}(M^{\prime})   , we have:          {  f  ,  g  }    M  ′     (   φ   (  x  )    )    =     {   f  ∘  φ   ,   g  ∘  φ   }   M    (  x  )     .         subscript   f  g    superscript  M  normal-′      φ  x       subscript     f  φ     g  φ    M   x     {\{f,g\}_{M^{\prime}}}(\varphi(x))={\{f\circ\varphi,g\circ\varphi\}_{M}}(x).     In terms of Poisson bi-vectors, the condition that a map be Poisson is tantamount to requiring that    π  M     subscript  π  M    \pi_{M}   and    π   M  ′      subscript  π   superscript  M  normal-′     \pi_{M^{\prime}}   be   φ   φ   \varphi   -related.  Poisson manifolds are the objects of a category    𝔓  𝔬  𝔦  𝔰  𝔰      𝔓  𝔬  𝔦  𝔰  𝔰    \mathfrak{Poiss}   , with Poisson maps as morphisms.  Examples of Poisson maps:   The Cartesian product    (    M  0   ×   M  1    ,    π  0   ×   π  1    )        subscript  M  0    subscript  M  1       subscript  π  0    subscript  π  1      (M_{0}\times M_{1},\pi_{0}\times\pi_{1})   of two Poisson manifolds    (   M  0   ,   π  0   )      subscript  M  0    subscript  π  0     (M_{0},\pi_{0})   and    (   M  1   ,   π  1   )      subscript  M  1    subscript  π  1     (M_{1},\pi_{1})   is again a Poisson manifold, and the canonical projections     pr  i   :     M  0   ×   M  1    →   M  i       normal-:   subscript  pr  i    normal-→     subscript  M  0    subscript  M  1     subscript  M  i      \mathrm{pr}_{i}:M_{0}\times M_{1}\to M_{i}   , for    i  ∈   {  0  ,  1  }       i   0  1     i\in\{0,1\}   , are Poisson maps.  The inclusion mapping of a symplectic leaf, or of an open subspace, is a Poisson map.   It must be highlighted that the notion of a Poisson map is fundamentally different from that of a symplectic map. For instance, with their standard symplectic structures, there do not exist Poisson maps     ℝ  2   →   ℝ  4      normal-→   superscript  ℝ  2    superscript  ℝ  4     \mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}^{4}   , whereas symplectic maps abound.  One interesting, and somewhat surprising, fact is that any Poisson manifold is the codomain/image of a surjective, submersive Poisson map from a symplectic manifold. 4 5 6  See also   Nambu-Poisson manifold  Poisson–Lie group  Poisson supermanifold   References        2        Available at thesis   See also the review by Ping Xu in the Bulletin of the AMS.
