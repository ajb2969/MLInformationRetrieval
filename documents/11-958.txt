Ornithine N-benzoyltransferase




Ornithine N-benzoyltransferase

In enzymology, an ornithine N-benzoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2 benzoyl-CoA + L-ornithine 
 
 
 
  2 CoA + N2,N5-dibenzoyl-L-ornithine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are benzoyl-CoA and L-ornithine, whereas its two products are CoA and N2,N5-dibenzoyl-L-ornithine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is benzoyl-CoA:L-ornithine N-benzoyltransferase. This enzyme is also called ornithine N-acyltransferase.
