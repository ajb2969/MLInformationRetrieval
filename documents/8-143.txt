   Charge (physics)      Charge (physics)   In physics , a charge may refer to one of many different quantities, such as the electric charge in electromagnetism or the color charge in quantum chromodynamics . Charges are associated with conserved quantum numbers .  Formal definition  More abstractly, a charge is any generator of a continuous symmetry of the physical system under study. When a physical system has a symmetry of some sort, Noether's theorem implies the existence of a conserved current . The thing that "flows" in the current is the "charge", the charge is the generator of the (local) symmetry group . This charge is sometimes called the Noether charge .  Thus, for example, the electric charge is the generator of the U(1) symmetry of electromagnetism . The conserved current is the electric current .  In the case of local, dynamical symmetries, associated with every charge is a gauge field ; when quantized, the gauge field becomes a gauge boson . The charges of the theory "radiate" the gauge field. Thus, for example, the gauge field of electromagnetism is the electromagnetic field ; and the gauge boson is the photon .  Sometimes, the word "charge" is used as a synonym for "generator" in referring to the generator of the symmetry. More precisely, when the symmetry group is a Lie group , then the charges are understood to correspond to the root system of the Lie group; the discreteness of the root system accounting for the quantization of the charge.  Examples  Various charge quantum numbers have been introduced by theories of particle physics . These include the charges of the Standard Model :   The color charge of quarks . The color charge generates the SU(3) color symmetry of quantum chromodynamics .  The weak isospin quantum numbers of the electroweak interaction . It generates the SU(2) part of the electroweak SU(2) × U(1) symmetry. Weak isospin is a local symmetry, whose gauge bosons are the W and Z bosons .  The electric charge for electromagnetic interactions.   Charges of approximate symmetries:   The strong isospin charges. The symmetry groups is SU(2)  flavor symmetry; the gauge bosons are the pions . The pions are not elementary particles , and the symmetry is only approximate. It is a special case of flavor symmetry.  Other quark -flavor charges, such as strangeness or charm . Together with the – isospin mentioned above, these generate the global SU(6) flavor symmetry of the fundamental particles; this symmetry is badly broken by the masses of the heavy quarks.   Hypothetical charges of extensions to the Standard Model:   The hypothetical magnetic charge is another charge in the theory of electromagnetism. Magnetic charges are not seen experimentally in laboratory experiments, but would be present for theories including magnetic monopoles .   In the formalism of particle theories charge-like quantum numbers can sometimes be inverted by means of a charge conjugation operator called C. Chiral fermions often cannot. Charge conjugation simply means that a given symmetry group occurs in two inequivalent (but still isomorphic ) group representations . It is usually the case that the two charge-conjugate representations are complex conjugate  fundamental representations of the Lie group. Their product then forms the adjoint representation of the group.  Thus, a common example is that the product of two charge-conjugate fundamental representations of SL(2,C) (the spinors ) forms the adjoint rep of the Lorentz group SO(3,1); abstractly, one writes       2  ⊗   2  ¯    =   3  ⊕  1.        tensor-product  2   normal-¯  2     direct-sum  3  1.     2\otimes\overline{2}=3\oplus 1.
