   Martin measure      Martin measure   In descriptive set theory , the Martin measure is a filter on the set of Turing degrees of sets of natural numbers , named after Donald A. Martin . Under the axiom of determinacy it can be shown to be an ultrafilter .  Definition  Let   D   D   D   be the set of Turing degrees of sets of natural numbers. Given some equivalence class     [  X  ]   ∈  D       delimited-[]  X   D    [X]\in D   , we may define the cone (or upward cone ) of    [  X  ]     delimited-[]  X    [X]   as the set of all Turing degrees    [  Y  ]     delimited-[]  Y    [Y]   such that    X   ≤  T   Y      subscript   T   X  Y    X\leq_{T}Y   ; that is, the set of Turing degrees which are "more complex" than   X   X   X   under Turing reduction.  We say that a set   A   A   A   of Turing degrees has measure 1 under the Martin measure exactly when   A   A   A   contains some cone. Since it is possible, for any   A   A   A   , to construct a game in which player I has a winning strategy exactly when   A   A   A   contains a cone and in which player II has a winning strategy exactly when the complement of   A   A   A   contains a cone, the axiom of determinacy implies that the measure-1 sets of Turing degrees form an ultrafilter.  Consequences  It is easy to show that a countable intersection of cones is itself a cone; the Martin measure is therefore a countably complete filter. This fact, combined with the fact that the Martin measure may be transferred to    ω  1     subscript  ω  1    \omega_{1}   by a simple mapping, tells us that    ω  1     subscript  ω  1    \omega_{1}   is measurable under the axiom of determinacy. This result shows part of the important connection between determinacy and large cardinals .  References     "  Category:Descriptive set theory  Category:Determinacy  Category:Computability theory
