K-factor (fire protection)

In fire protection engineering, the K-factor formula is used to calculate the discharge rate from a nozzle. Nozzles can be fire sprinklers or water mist nozzles, hose reel nozzles, water monitors and deluge fire system nozzles.
K-Factors calculated in Metric units;
The flow rate of a nozzle is given by 
 
 
 
 ,1 where q is the flow rate in litres per minute (LPM), p is the pressure at the nozzle in Bar and K is the K-factor is given in units of 
 
 
 
 .
K-Factors have also been calculated and published in English units of PSI and GPM.
Care should be exercised not to intermix K-factors from Metric and English units as the resulting factors are not equivalent or interchangeable.
