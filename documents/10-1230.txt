   Quinate dehydrogenase (pyrroloquinoline-quinone)      Quinate dehydrogenase (pyrroloquinoline-quinone)   In enzymology , a quinate dehydrogenase (pyrroloquinoline-quinone) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   quinate + pyrroloquinoline-quinone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-dehydroquinate + reduced pyrroloquinoline-quinone   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are quinate and pyrroloquinoline-quinone , whereas its two products are 3-dehydroquinate and reduced pyrroloquinoline-quinone .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is quinate:pyrroloquinoline-quinone 3-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include NAD(P)+-independent quinate dehydrogenase , and quinate:pyrroloquinoline-quinone 5-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis .  References      "  Category:EC 1.1.99  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
