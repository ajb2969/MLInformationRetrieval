Nucleoside oxidase (H2O2-forming)

 Nucleoside oxidase (H2O2-forming) () is an enzyme with system name nucleoside:oxygen 5'-oxidoreductase (H2O2-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

adenosine + 2 O2 + H2O 
 
 
 
  9-riburonosyladenine + 2 H2O2 (overall reaction)
 
(1a) adenosine + O2

 
  5'-dehydroadenosine + H2O2

(1b) 5'-dehydroadenosine + O2 + H2O 
 
 
 
  9-riburonosyladenine + H2O2


This enzyme contains Heme and belongs to a flavoprotein family.
