Competitive Regret

{{ Multiple issues|   }} In decision theory, the competitive regret is the relative regret compared to an oracle with limited or unlimited power in the process of distribution estimation.
Competitive Regret to the Oracle with Full Power
Consider estimating a discrete probability distribution

 
  on a discrete set 
 
 
 
  based on data 
 
 
 
 , the regret of an estimator1

 
  is defined as



where 
 
 
 
  is the set of all possible probability distribution, and



where 
 
 
 
  is the Kullback–Leibler divergence between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Competitive Regret to the Oracle with Limited Power
Oracle with Partial Information
The oracle is restricted to have access to partial information of the true distribution 
 
 
 
  by knowing the location of 
 
 
 
  in the parameter space up to a partition.2 Given a partition 
 
 
 
  of the parameter space, and suppose the oracle knows the subset 
 
 
 
  where the true 
 
 
 
 . The oracle will have regret as



The competitive regret to the oracle will be



Oracle with Partial Information
The oracle knows exactly 
 
 
 
 , but can only choose the estimator among natural estimators.A natural estimator assigns equal probability to the symbols which appear the same number of time in the sample.3 The regret of the oracle is



and the competitive regret is
