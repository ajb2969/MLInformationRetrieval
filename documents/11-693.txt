Choloylglycine hydrolase




Choloylglycine hydrolase

In enzymology, a choloylglycine hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholan-24-oylglycine + H2O 
 
 
 
  3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholanate + glycine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholan-24-oylglycine and H2O, whereas its two products are 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholanate and glycine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholan-24-oylglycine amidohydrolase. Other names in common use include glycocholase, bile salt hydrolase, and choloyltaurine hydrolase. This enzyme participates in bile acid biosynthesis.
