   Deviation of a local ring      Deviation of a local ring   In commutative algebra , the deviations of a local ring  R are certain invariants ε i ( R ) that measure how far the ring is from being regular .  Definition  The deviations ε n of a local ring  R with residue field  k are non-negative integers defined in terms of its Poincaré series  P ( x ) by        P   (  x  )    =    ∑   n  ≥  0      x  n     Tor  n  R    (  k  ,  k  )      =    ∏   n  ≥  0       (   1  +   t    2  n   +  1     )    ε   2  n       (   1  -   t    2  n   +  2     )    ε    2  n   +  1        .

 1+t^{2n+1})^{\varepsilon_{2n}}}{(1-t^{2n+2})^{\varepsilon_{2n+1}}}.     The zeroth deviation ε 0 is the embedding dimension of R (the dimension of its tangent space). The first deviation ε 1 vanishes exactly when the ring R is a regular local ring , in which case all the higher deviations also vanish. The second deviation ε 2 vanishes exactly when the ring R is a complete intersection ring , in which case all the higher deviations vanish.  References     "  Category:Commutative algebra
