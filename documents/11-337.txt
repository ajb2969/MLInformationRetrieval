Fe3+-transporting ATPase




Fe3+-transporting ATPase

In enzymology, a Fe3+-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + H2O + Fe3+out 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + Fe3+in
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, H2O, and Fe3+, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and Fe3+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (ferric-ion-transporting). This enzyme participates in abc transporters - general.
