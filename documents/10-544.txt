Hydroxymalonate dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a hydroxymalonate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

hydroxymalonate + NAD+

 
  oxomalonate + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are hydroxymalonate and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are oxomalonate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hydroxymalonate:NAD+ oxidoreductase.
