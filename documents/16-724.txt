Cyclic subspace

In mathematics, in linear algebra, a cyclic subspace is a certain special subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space associated with a vector in the vector space and a linear transformation of the vector space. The cyclic subspace associated with a vector v in a vector space V and a linear transformation T of V is called the ''' T-cyclic subspace generated by v'''. The concept of a cyclic subspace is a basic component in the formulation of the cyclic decomposition theorem in linear algebra.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a linear transformation of a vector space 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  be a vector in 
 
 
 
 . The 
 
 
 
 -cyclic subspace of 
 
 
 
  generated by 
 
 
 
  is the subspace 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  generated by the set of vectors 
 
 
 
 . This subspace is denoted by 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is called a cyclic vector for 
 
 
 
 .1
There is another equivalent definition of cyclic spaces. Let 
 
 
 
  be a linear transformation of a finite dimensional vector space over a field

 
  and 
 
 
 
  be a vector in 
 
 
 
 . The set of all vectors of the form 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a polynomial in the ring

 
  of all polynomials in 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
 , is the 
 
 
 
 -cyclic subspace generated by

Examples

For any vector space 
 
 
 
  and any linear operator 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , the 
 
 
 
 -cyclic subspace generated by the zero vector is the zero-subspace of 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is the identity operator then every 
 
 
 
 -cyclic subspace is one-dimensional.


 
  is one-dimensional if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a characteristic vector of 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be the two-dimensional vector space and let 
 
 
 
  be the linear operator on 
 
 
 
  represented by the matrix 
 
 
 
  relative to the standard ordered basis of 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 . Therefore 
 
 
 
  and so 
 
 
 
 . Thus 
 
 
 
  is a cyclic vector for 
 
 
 
 .

Companion matrix
Let 
 
 
 
  be a linear transformation of a 
 
 
 
 -dimensional vector space 
 
 
 
  over a field 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be a cyclic vector for 
 
 
 
 . Then the vectors








form an ordered basis for 
 
 
 
 . Let the characteristic polynomial for 
 
 
 
  be




 
 .
 



Then






\begin{align} Tv_1 & = v_2\\ Tv_2 & = v_3\\ Tv_3 & = v_4\\ \vdots & \\ Tv_{n-1} & = v_n\\ Tv_n &= -c_0v_1 -c_1v_2 - \cdots c_{n-1}v_n \end{align} 
Therefore, relative to the ordered basis 
 
 
 
 , the operator 
 
 
 
  is represented by the matrix






\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & -c_0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & -c_1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & -c_2 \\ \vdots & & & & & \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 1 & -c_{n-1} \end{bmatrix} 
This matrix is called the companion matrix of the polynomial
