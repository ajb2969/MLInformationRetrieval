   Decylcitrate synthase      Decylcitrate synthase   Decylcitrate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction in enzymology.   lauroyl-CoA + H 2 O + oxaloacetate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (2S,3S)-2-hydroxytridecane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate + CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are lauroyl-CoA , H 2 O , and oxaloacetate , whereas its two products are (2S,3S)-2-hydroxytridecane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate and CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases that convert acyl groups into alkyl groups on transfer. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dodecanoyl-CoA:oxaloacetate C-dodecanoyltransferase (thioester-hydrolysing, 1-carboxyundecyl-forming) . Other names in common use include 2-decylcitrate synthase , (2S,3S)-2-hydroxytridecane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate oxaloacetate-lyase , and (CoA-acylating) .
