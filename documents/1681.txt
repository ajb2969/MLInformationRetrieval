   Class number formula      Class number formula   In number theory , the class number formula relates many important invariants of a number field to a special value of its Dedekind zeta function  General statement of the class number formula  We start with the following data:      K   K   K   is a number field.   n {{=}} r 1 + 2 r 2 }} , where denotes the number of real embeddings of   K   K   K   , and is the number of complex embeddings of   K   K   K   .  is the Dedekind zeta function of   K   K   K   .  is the class number , the number of elements in the ideal class group of   K   K   K   .  is the regulator of   K   K   K   .  is the number of roots of unity contained in   K   K   K   .  is the discriminant of the extension     K  /  ùêê      K  ùêê    K/\mathbf{Q}   .   Then:   Theorem (Class Number Formula).   converges absolutely for     R  e   (  s  )    >  1        R  e  s   1    Re(s)>1   and extends to a meromorphic  function defined for all complex   s   s   s   with only one simple pole at    s  =  1      s  1    s=1   , with residue           lim   s  ‚Üí  1      (   s  -  1   )    Œ∂  K    (  s  )     =     2   r  1    ‚ãÖ    (   2  œÄ   )    r  2    ‚ãÖ   h  K   ‚ãÖ   Reg  K      w  K   ‚ãÖ    |   D  K   |            subscript    normal-‚Üí  s  1        s  1    subscript  Œ∂  K   s       normal-‚ãÖ   superscript  2   subscript  r  1     superscript    2  œÄ    subscript  r  2     subscript  h  K    subscript  Reg  K     normal-‚ãÖ   subscript  w  K        subscript  D  K         \lim_{s\to 1}(s-1)\zeta_{K}(s)=\frac{2^{r_{1}}\cdot(2\pi)^{r_{2}}\cdot h_{K}%
 \cdot\operatorname{Reg}_{K}}{w_{K}\cdot\sqrt{|D_{K}|}}        This is the most general "class number formula". In particular cases, for example when   K   K   K   is a cyclotomic extension of   ùêê   ùêê   \mathbf{Q}   , there are particular and more refined class number formulas.  Proof  The idea of the proof of the class number formula is most easily seen when K = Q (i). In this case, the ring of integers in K is the Gaussian integers .  An elementary manipulation shows that the residue of the Dedekind zeta function at s = 1 is the average of the coefficients of the Dirichlet series representation of the Dedekind zeta function. The n -th coefficient of the Dirichlet series is essentially the number of representations of n as a sum of two squares of nonnegative integers. So one can compute the residue of the Dedekind zeta function at s = 1 by computing the average number of representations. As in the article on the Gauss circle problem , one can compute this by approximating the number of lattice points inside of a quarter circle centered at the origin, concluding that the residue is one quarter of pi.  The proof when K is an arbitrary imaginary quadratic number field is very similar. 1  In the general case, by Dirichlet's unit theorem , the group of units in the ring of integers of K is infinite. One can nevertheless reduce the computation of the residue to a lattice point counting problem using the classical theory of real and complex embeddings 2 and approximate the number of lattice points in a region by the volume of the region, to complete the proof.  Dirichlet class number formula  Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet published a proof of the class number formula for quadratic fields in 1839, but it was stated in the language of quadratic forms rather than classes of ideals . It appears that Gauss already knew this formula in 1801. 3  This exposition follows Davenport . 4  Let d be a fundamental discriminant , and write h(d) for the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms with discriminant d . Let    œá  =   (    d  m    )       œá    d  m     \chi=\left(\!\frac{d}{m}\!\right)   be the Kronecker symbol . Then   œá   œá   \chi   is a Dirichlet character . Write    L   (  s  ,  œá  )       L   s  œá     L(s,\chi)   for the Dirichlet L-series based on   œá   œá   \chi   . For d > 0 , let t > 0 , u > 0 be the solution to the Pell equation       t  2   -   d   u  2     =  4         superscript  t  2     d   superscript  u  2     4    t^{2}-du^{2}=4   for which u is smallest, and write       œµ  =    1  2    (   t  +   u   d     )     .      œµ      1  2     t    u    d        \epsilon=\frac{1}{2}(t+u\sqrt{d}).   (Then Œµ is either a fundamental unit of the real quadratic field     ‚Ñö   (   d   )       ‚Ñö    d     \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})   or the square of a fundamental unit.) For d w = \begin{cases} 2, & d  Then Dirichlet showed that       h   (  d  )    =   {         w    |  d  |      2  œÄ    L   (  1  ,  œá  )    ,       d  <  0   ;           d    ln  œµ    L   (  1  ,  œá  )    ,      d  >  0.             h  d    cases        w      d       2  œÄ    L   1  œá      d  0         d     œµ    L   1  œá      d  0.      h(d)=\begin{cases}\dfrac{w\sqrt{|d|}}{2\pi}L(1,\chi),&d<0;\\
 \dfrac{\sqrt{d}}{\ln\epsilon}L(1,\chi),&d>0.\end{cases}   This is a special case of Theorem 1 above: for a quadratic field  K , the Dedekind zeta function is just      Œ∂  K    (  s  )    =   Œ∂   (  s  )   L   (  s  ,  œá  )           subscript  Œ∂  K   s     Œ∂  s  L   s  œá      \zeta_{K}(s)=\zeta(s)L(s,\chi)   , and the residue is    L   (  1  ,  œá  )       L   1  œá     L(1,\chi)   . Dirichlet also showed that the L -series can be written in a finite form, which gives a finite form for the class number. Suppose   œá   œá   \chi   is primitive with prime conductor    q   q   q   . Then       L   (  1  ,  œá  )    =   {       -    œÄ   q   3  /  2        ‚àë   m  =  1    q  -  1      m   (   m  q   )       ,       q  ‚â°   3  mod  4    ;         -    1   q   1  /  2        ‚àë   m  =  1    q  -  1       (   m  q   )    ln   2   sin    m  œÄ   q          ,      q  ‚â°   1  mod  4.              L   1  œá     cases        œÄ   superscript  q    3  2       superscript   subscript     m  1      q  1      m    m  q         q   modulo  3  4          1   superscript  q    1  2       superscript   subscript     m  1      q  1        m  q       2        m  œÄ   q            q   modulo  1  4.       L(1,\chi)=\begin{cases}-\dfrac{\pi}{q^{3/2}}\sum_{m=1}^{q-1}m\left(\dfrac{m}{q%
 }\right),&q\equiv 3\mod 4;\\
 -\dfrac{1}{q^{1/2}}\sum_{m=1}^{q-1}\left(\dfrac{m}{q}\right)\ln 2\sin\dfrac{m%
 \pi}{q},&q\equiv 1\mod 4.\end{cases}     Galois extensions of the rationals  If K is a Galois extension of Q , the theory of Artin L-functions applies to     Œ∂  K    (  s  )        subscript  Œ∂  K   s    \zeta_{K}(s)   . It has one factor of the Riemann zeta function , which has a pole of residue one, and the quotient is regular at s = 1. This means that the right-hand side of the class number formula can be equated to a left-hand side   Œ† L (1,œÅ) dim œÅ    with œÅ running over the classes of irreducible non-trivial complex linear representations of Gal( K / Q ) of dimension dim(œÅ). That is according to the standard decomposition of the regular representation .  Abelian extensions of the rationals  This is the case of the above, with Gal( K / Q ) an abelian group , in which all the œÅ can be replaced by Dirichlet characters (via class field theory ) for some modulus f called the conductor . Therefore all the L (1) values occur for Dirichlet L-functions , for which there is a classical formula, involving logarithms.  By the Kronecker‚ÄìWeber theorem , all the values required for an analytic class number formula occur already when the cyclotomic fields are considered. In that case there is a further formulation possible, as shown by Kummer . The regulator , a calculation of volume in 'logarithmic space' as divided by the logarithms of the units of the cyclotomic field, can be set against the quantities from the L (1) recognisable as logarithms of cyclotomic units . There result formulae stating that the class number is determined by the index of the cyclotomic units in the whole group of units.  In Iwasawa theory , these ideas are further combined with Stickelberger's theorem .
