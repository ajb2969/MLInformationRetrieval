   Laplacian smoothing      Laplacian smoothing   Laplacian smoothing is an algorithm to smooth a polygonal mesh . 1 2 For each vertex in a mesh, a new position is chosen based on local information (such as the position of neighbors) and the vertex is moved there. In the case that a mesh is topologically a rectangular grid (that is, each internal vertex is connected to four neighbors) then this operation produces the Laplacian of the mesh.  More formally, the smoothing operation may be described per-vertex as:        x  ¯   i   =    1  N     ∑   j  =  1   N     x  ¯   j          subscript   normal-¯  x   i       1  N     superscript   subscript     j  1    N    subscript   normal-¯  x   j       \bar{x}_{i}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\bar{x}_{j}     Where   N   N   N   is the number of adjacent vertices to node   i   i   i   ,     x  ¯   j     subscript   normal-¯  x   j    \bar{x}_{j}   is the position of the   j   j   j   -th adjacent vertex and     x  ¯   i     subscript   normal-¯  x   i    \bar{x}_{i}   is the new position for node   i   i   i   . 3  See also   Tutte embedding , an embedding of a planar mesh in which each vertex is already at the average of its neighbors' positions   References    "  Category:Mesh generation     . ↩  ↩  ↩
