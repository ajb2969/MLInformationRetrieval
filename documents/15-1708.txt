Cyclic-guanylate-specific phosphodiesterase

Cyclic-guanylate-specific phosphodiesterase (, cyclic bis(3->5')diguanylate phosphodiesterase, c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase, c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase, phosphodiesterase, phosphodiesterase A1, PDEA1, VieA) is an enzyme with system name cyclic bis(3->5')diguanylate 3-guanylylhydrolase.12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

cyclic di-3',5'-guanylate + H2O 
 
 
 
  5'-phosphoguanylyl(3'->5')guanosine
 

This enzyme requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ for activity. It is inhibited by Ca2+ and Zn2+.
