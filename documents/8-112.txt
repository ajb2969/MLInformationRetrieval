Malament–Hogarth spacetime
A '''Malament–Hogarth (M-H) spacetime''', named after [[David B. Malament]] and [[Mark Hogarth]], is a [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[spacetime]] that possesses the following property: there exists a [[worldline]]  and an event  such that all events along  are a finite interval in the past of th>p, but the proper time along 
 
 
 
  is infinite. The event 
 
 
 
  is known as an M-H event. The significance of M-H spacetimes is that they allow for the implementation of certain non-Turing computable tasks (hypercomputation). The idea is for an observer at some event in 
 
 
 
 's past to set a computer (Turing machine) to work on some task and then have the Turing machine travel on 
 
 
 
 , computing for all eternity. Since 
 
 
 
  lies in 
 
 
 
 's past, the Turing machine can signal (a solution) to 
 
 
 
  at any stage of this never-ending task. Meanwhile, the observer takes a quick trip (finite proper time) through spacetime to 
 
 
 
 , to pick up the solution. The set-up can be used to decide the halting problem, which is known to be undecidable by an ordinary Turing machine. All the observer needs to do is to prime the Turing machine to signal to 
 
 
 
  if and only if the Turing machine halts.
The Kerr metric, which describes empty spacetime around a rotating black hole, possesses these features: a computer can orbit the black hole indefinitely, while an observer falling into the black hole experiences an M-H event as they cross the inner event horizon. (This, however, neglects the effects of Black Hole Evaporation.)1
