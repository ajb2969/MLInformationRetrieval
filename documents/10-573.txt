   L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase      L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-threonine + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-2-amino-3-oxobutanoate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-threonine and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are L-2-amino-3-oxobutanoate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-threonine:NAD + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include L-threonine dehydrogenase , threonine 3-dehydrogenase , and threonine dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
