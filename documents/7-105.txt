   Effective descriptive set theory      Effective descriptive set theory   Effective descriptive set theory is the branch of descriptive set theory dealing with sets of reals having lightface definitions; that is, definitions that do not require an arbitrary real parameter (Moschovakis 1980). Thus effective descriptive set theory combines descriptive set theory with recursion theory .  Constructions  Effective Polish space  An effective Polish space is a complete  separable  metric space that has a computable presentation . Such spaces are studied in both effective descriptive set theory and in constructive analysis . In particular, standard examples of Polish spaces such as the real line , the Cantor set and the Baire space are all effective Polish spaces.  Arithmetical hierarchy  The arithmetical hierarchy , arithmetic hierarchy or Kleene-Mostowski hierarchy classifies certain sets based on the complexity of formulas that define them. Any set that receives a classification is called arithmetical .  More formally, the arithmetical hierarchy assigns classifications to the formulas in the language of first-order arithmetic . The classifications are denoted    Σ  n  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   n    \Sigma^{0}_{n}   and    Π  n  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  0   n    \Pi^{0}_{n}   for natural numbers n (including 0). The Greek letters here are lightface symbols, which indicates that the formulas do not contain set parameters.  If a formula   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is logically equivalent to a formula with only bounded quantifiers then   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is assigned the classifications    Σ  0  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   0    \Sigma^{0}_{0}   and    Π  0  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  0   0    \Pi^{0}_{0}   .  The classifications    Σ  n  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   n    \Sigma^{0}_{n}   and    Π  n  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  0   n    \Pi^{0}_{n}   are defined inductively for every natural number n using the following rules:   If   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is logically equivalent to a formula of the form    ∃    n  1    ∃    n  2   ⋯   ∃    n  k   ψ              subscript  n  1        subscript  n  2   normal-⋯       subscript  n  k   ψ         \exists n_{1}\exists n_{2}\cdots\exists n_{k}\psi   , where   ψ   ψ   \psi   is    Π  n  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  0   n    \Pi^{0}_{n}   , then   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is assigned the classification    Σ   n  +  1   0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0     n  1     \Sigma^{0}_{n+1}   .  If   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is logically equivalent to a formula of the form    ∀    n  1    ∀    n  2   ⋯   ∀    n  k   ψ          for-all     subscript  n  1    for-all     subscript  n  2   normal-⋯   for-all     subscript  n  k   ψ         \forall n_{1}\forall n_{2}\cdots\forall n_{k}\psi   , where   ψ   ψ   \psi   is    Σ  n  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  0   n    \Sigma^{0}_{n}   , then   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is assigned the classification    Π   n  +  1   0     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  0     n  1     \Pi^{0}_{n+1}   .
