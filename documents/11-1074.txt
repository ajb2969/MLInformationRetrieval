   Cysteine-conjugate transaminase      Cysteine-conjugate transaminase   In enzymology , a cysteine-conjugate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-(4-bromophenyl)-L-cysteine + 2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-(4-bromophenyl)mercaptopyruvate + L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-(4-bromophenyl)-L-cysteine and 2-oxoglutarate , whereas its two products are S-(4-bromophenyl)mercaptopyruvate and L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-(4-bromophenyl)-L-cysteine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include cysteine conjugate aminotransferase , and cysteine-conjugate alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase (CAT-1) .
