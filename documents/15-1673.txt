Pheophorbidase

Pheophorbidase (, phedase, PPD) is an enzyme with system name pheophorbide-a hydrolase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

pheophorbide a + H2O 
 
 
pyropheophorbide a + methanol + CO2 (overall reaction)
 
(1a) pheophorbide a + H2O 
 
 
 
  C-132-carboxypyropheophorbide a + methanol
 
(1b) C-132-carboxypyropheophorbide a 
 
 
 
  pyropheophorbide a + CO2 (spontaneous)
 

This enzyme participates in the chlorophyll degradation in higher plants and algae.
