   Lie bracket of vector fields      Lie bracket of vector fields   In the mathematical field of differential topology , the Lie bracket of vector fields , also known as the Jacobi–Lie bracket or the commutator of vector fields , is an operator that assigns, to any two vector fields  X and Y on a smooth manifold  M , a third vector field denoted [ X , Y ].  Conceptually, the Lie bracket [ X , Y ] is the derivative of Y along the flow generated by X . A generalization of the Lie bracket is the Lie derivative , which allows differentiation of any tensor field along the flow generated by X . The Lie bracket [ X,Y ] equals the Lie derivative of the vector Y (which is a tensor field) along X , and is sometimes denoted     ℒ  X   Y       subscript  ℒ  X   Y    \mathcal{L}_{X}Y   (read "the Lie derivative of Y along X ").  The Lie bracket is an R - bilinear operation and turns the set of all vector fields on the manifold M into an (infinite-dimensional) Lie algebra .  The Lie bracket plays an important role in differential geometry and differential topology , for instance in the Frobenius theorem , and is also fundamental in the geometric theory for nonlinear control systems (, nonholonomic systems ; , feedback linearization ).  Definitions  There are three conceptually different but equivalent approaches to defining the Lie bracket:  Vector fields as derivations  Each vector field X on a smooth manifold M may be regarded as a differential operator acting on smooth functions on M . Indeed, each smooth vector field X becomes a derivation on the smooth functions C ∞ (M) when we define X(f) to be the element of C ∞ (M) whose value at a point p is the directional derivative of f at p in the direction X(p) . Furthermore, it is known that any derivation on C ∞ (M) arises in this fashion from a uniquely determined smooth vector field X .  In general, the commutator       δ  1   ∘   δ  2    -    δ  2   ∘   δ  1           subscript  δ  1    subscript  δ  2       subscript  δ  2    subscript  δ  1      \delta_{1}\circ\delta_{2}-\delta_{2}\circ\delta_{1}   of any two derivations    δ  1     subscript  δ  1    \delta_{1}   and    δ  2     subscript  δ  2    \delta_{2}   is again a derivation. This can be used to define the Lie bracket of vector fields as follows.  The Lie bracket, [ X,Y ], of two smooth vector fields X and Y is the smooth vector field [ X,Y ] such that         [  X  ,  Y  ]    (  f  )    =    X   (   Y   (  f  )    )    -   Y   (   X   (  f  )    )   for all  f    ∈    C  ∞    (  M  )     .           X  Y   f       X    Y  f      Y    X  f   for all  f            superscript  C    M      [X,Y](f)=X(Y(f))-Y(X(f))\;\;\text{ for all }f\in C^{\infty}(M).     Flows and limits  Let    Φ  t  X     subscript   superscript  normal-Φ  X   t    \Phi^{X}_{t}   be the flow associated with the vector field X , and let d denote the tangent map derivative operator . Then the Lie bracket of X and Y at the point x ∈ M can be defined as        [  X  ,  Y  ]   x   :=    lim   t  →  0        (   d   Φ   -  t   X    )    Y    Φ  t  X    (  x  )      -   Y  x    t    =      d   d  t    |    t  =  0     (   d   Φ   -  t   X    )    Y    Φ  t  X    (  x  )           assign   subscript   X  Y   x     subscript    normal-→  t  0            normal-d   subscript   superscript  normal-Φ  X     t      subscript  Y     subscript   superscript  normal-Φ  X   t   x      subscript  Y  x    t            evaluated-at    normal-d    normal-d  t      t  0      normal-d   subscript   superscript  normal-Φ  X     t      subscript  Y     subscript   superscript  normal-Φ  X   t   x        [X,Y]_{x}:=\lim_{t\to 0}\frac{(\mathrm{d}\Phi^{X}_{-t})Y_{\Phi^{X}_{t}(x)}-Y_{%

 {-\sqrt{t}}\circ\Phi^{Y}_{\sqrt{t}}\circ\Phi^{X}_{\sqrt{t}})(x)     In coordinates  Though neither definition of the Lie bracket depends on a choice of coordinates, in practice one often wants to compute the bracket with respect to a coordinate system.  If we have picked a coordinate chart on M with local coordinate functions    {   x  i   }      superscript  x  i     \{x^{i}\}   , and we write     ∂  i   =   ∂   ∂   x  i          subscript   i         superscript  x  i       \partial_{i}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i}}   for the associated local basis for the tangent bundle, then the vector fields can be written as      X  =    ∑   i  =  1   n     X  i    ∂  i         X    superscript   subscript     i  1    n      superscript  X  i    subscript   i       X=\sum_{i=1}^{n}X^{i}\partial_{i}   and      Y  =    ∑   i  =  1   n     Y  i    ∂  i         Y    superscript   subscript     i  1    n      superscript  Y  i    subscript   i       Y=\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y^{i}\partial_{i}   with smooth functions     X  i   :   M  →  ℝ      normal-:   superscript  X  i    normal-→  M  ℝ     X^{i}:M\to\mathbb{R}   and     Y  i   :   M  →  ℝ      normal-:   superscript  Y  i    normal-→  M  ℝ     Y^{i}:M\to\mathbb{R}   . Then the Lie bracket is given by       [  X  ,  Y  ]   :=    ∑   i  =  1   n     (    X   (   Y  i   )    -   Y   (   X  i   )     )    ∂  i     =    ∑   i  =  1   n     ∑   j  =  1   n     (     X  j     ∂  j    Y  i     -    Y  j     ∂  j    X  i      )    ∂  i           assign   X  Y     superscript   subscript     i  1    n         X   superscript  Y  i      Y   superscript  X  i      subscript   i            superscript   subscript     i  1    n     superscript   subscript     j  1    n          superscript  X  j     subscript   j    superscript  Y  i        superscript  Y  j     subscript   j    superscript  X  i       subscript   i         [X,Y]:=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(X(Y^{i})-Y(X^{i})\right)\partial_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}%
 \sum_{j=1}^{n}\left(X^{j}\partial_{j}Y^{i}-Y^{j}\partial_{j}X^{i}\right)%
 \partial_{i}     If M is (an open subset of) R n , then the vector fields X and Y can be written as smooth maps of the form    X  :   M  →   ℝ  n       normal-:  X   normal-→  M   superscript  ℝ  n      X:M\to\mathbb{R}^{n}   and    Y  :   M  →   ℝ  n       normal-:  Y   normal-→  M   superscript  ℝ  n      Y:M\to\mathbb{R}^{n}   , and the Lie bracket     [  X  ,  Y  ]   :   M  →   ℝ  n       normal-:   X  Y    normal-→  M   superscript  ℝ  n      [X,Y]:M\to\mathbb{R}^{n}   is given by       [  X  ,  Y  ]   :=     J  Y   X   -    J  X   Y       assign   X  Y        subscript  J  Y   X      subscript  J  X   Y      [X,Y]:=J_{Y}X-J_{X}Y   where    J  Y     subscript  J  Y    J_{Y}   and    J  X     subscript  J  X    J_{X}   are the Jacobian matrices of   Y   Y   Y   and   X   X   X   , respectively. These n -by- n matrices are multiplied by the n -vectors X and Y .  Properties  The Lie bracket of vector fields equips the real vector space    V  =   Γ   (   T  M   )        V    normal-Γ    T  M      V=\Gamma(TM)   of all vector fields on M (i.e., smooth sections of the tangent bundle    T  M      T  M    TM   of   M   M   M   ) with the structure of a Lie algebra , i.e., [·,·] is a map from    V  ×  V      V  V    V\times V   to   V   V   V   with the following properties       [  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ]     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    [\cdot,\cdot]   is R -bilinear       [  X  ,  Y  ]   =   -   [  Y  ,  X  ]         X  Y      Y  X      [X,Y]=-[Y,X]\,           [  X  ,   [  Y  ,  Z  ]   ]   +   [  Z  ,   [  X  ,  Y  ]   ]   +   [  Y  ,   [  Z  ,  X  ]   ]    =   0.          X   Y  Z     Z   X  Y     Y   Z  X     0.    [X,[Y,Z]]+[Z,[X,Y]]+[Y,[Z,X]]=0.\,   This is the Jacobi identity .   An immediate consequence of the second property is that     [  X  ,  X  ]   =  0       X  X   0    [X,X]=0   for any   X   X   X   .  Furthermore, there is a " product rule " for Lie brackets. Given a smooth real-valued function f defined on M and a vector field Y on M , we have a new vector field fY , defined by multiplying the vector Y x with the number f ( x ), at each point x ∈ M . The Lie bracket of X and fY is then given by        [  X  ,   f  Y   ]   =    X   (  f  )   Y   +   f   [  X  ,  Y  ]          X    f  Y        X  f  Y     f   X  Y       [X,fY]=X(f)Y+f[X,Y]      (where on the right-hand side we multiply the function X ( f ) with the vector field Y , and the function f with the vector field [ X,Y ]). This turns the vector fields with the Lie bracket into a Lie algebroid .  We also have the following fact:  Theorem:       [  X  ,  Y  ]   =   0        X  Y   0    [X,Y]=0\,   iff the flows of X and Y commute locally, i.e. iff for every x ∈ M and all sufficiently small real numbers s , t we have      (    Φ  t  Y    Φ  s  X    )    (  x  )    =    (     Φ  s  X     Φ  t  Y    )    (  x  )             subscript   superscript  normal-Φ  Y   t    subscript   superscript  normal-Φ  X   s    x        subscript   superscript  normal-Φ  X   s    subscript   superscript  normal-Φ  Y   t    x     (\Phi^{Y}_{t}\Phi^{X}_{s})(x)=(\Phi^{X}_{s}\,\Phi^{Y}_{t})(x)   .  Examples  For a Lie group  G , the corresponding Lie algebra is the tangent space at the identity, which can be identified with the left invariant vector fields on G . The Lie bracket of the Lie algebra is then the Lie bracket of the left invariant vector fields, which is also left invariant.  For a matrix Lie group, smooth vector fields can be locally represented in the corresponding Lie algebra. Since the Lie algebra associated with a Lie group is isomorphic to the group's tangent space at the identity, elements of the Lie algebra of a matrix Lie group are also matrices. Hence the Jacobi–Lie bracket corresponds to the usual commutator for a matrix group:       [  X  ,  Y  ]   =    X  Y   -   Y  X         X  Y       X  Y     Y  X      [X,Y]=XY-YX     where juxtaposition indicates matrix multiplication.  Applications  The Jacobi–Lie bracket is essential to proving small-time local controllability (STLC) for driftless affine control systems .  Generalizations  As mentioned above, the Lie derivative can be seen as a generalization of the Lie bracket. Another generalization of the Lie bracket (to vector-valued differential forms ) is the Frölicher–Nijenhuis bracket .
