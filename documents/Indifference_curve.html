<p>In <a href="microeconomic_theory" title="wikilink">microeconomic theory</a>, an <strong>indifference curve</strong> is a <a href="graph_of_a_function" title="wikilink">graph</a> showing different bundles of <a href="good_(economics)" title="wikilink">goods</a> between which a consumer is <em>indifferent.</em> That is, at each point on the curve, the consumer has no <a href="Preference_(economics)" title="wikilink">preference</a> for one bundle over another. One can equivalently refer to each point on the indifference curve as rendering the same level of <a class="uri" href="utility" title="wikilink">utility</a> (satisfaction) for the consumer. In other words an indifference curve is the <a href="Locus_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">locus</a> of various points showing different combinations of two goods providing equal utility to the consumer. Utility is then a device to represent <a href="preference" title="wikilink">preferences</a> rather than something from which preferences come.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The main use of indifference curves is in the <a href="Mathematical_problem" title="wikilink">representation</a> of potentially observable <a class="uri" href="demand" title="wikilink">demand</a> patterns for individual consumers over commodity bundles.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>There are infinitely many indifference curves: one passes through each combination. A collection of (selected) indifference curves, illustrated graphically, is referred to as an <strong>indifference map</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The theory of indifference curves was developed by <a href="Francis_Ysidro_Edgeworth" title="wikilink">Francis Ysidro Edgeworth</a>, who explained in his book "Mathematical Psychics: an Essay on the Application of Mathematics to the Moral Sciences,” 1881,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> the mathematics needed for its drawing; later on, <a href="Vilfredo_Pareto" title="wikilink">Vilfredo Pareto</a> was the first author to actually draw these curves, in his book "Manual of Political Economy," 1906;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and others in the first part of the 20th century. The theory can be derived from <a href="William_Stanley_Jevons" title="wikilink">William Stanley Jevons</a>'s <a href="ordinal_utility" title="wikilink">ordinal utility</a> theory, which posits that individuals can always rank any consumption bundles by order of preference.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="map-and-properties-of-indifference-curves">Map and properties of indifference curves</h2>

<p> A graph of indifference curves for an individual consumer associated with different utility levels is called an <strong>indifference map</strong>. Points yielding different utility levels are each associated with distinct indifference curves and these indifference curves on the indifference map are like contour lines on a topographical map. Each point on the curve represents the same elevation. If you move "off" an indifference curve traveling in a northeast direction (assuming positive marginal utility for the goods) you are essentially climbing a mound of utility. The higher you go the greater the level of utility. The non-satiation requirement means that you will never reach the "top," or a "<a href="bliss_point" title="wikilink">bliss point</a>," a consumption bundle that is preferred to all others</p>

<p>Indifference curves are typically represented to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Defined only in the non-negative <a href="Cartesian_coordinate_system" title="wikilink">quadrant</a> of commodity quantities (i.e. the possibility of having negative quantities of any good is ignored).</li>
<li><a href="Inverse_relationship" title="wikilink">Negatively</a> sloped. That is, as quantity consumed of one good (X) increases, total satisfaction would increase if not offset by a decrease in the quantity consumed of the other good (Y). Equivalently, <a href="Economic_satiation" title="wikilink">satiation</a>, such that more of either good (or both) is equally preferred to no increase, is excluded. (If utility <em>U = f(x, y)</em>, <em>U</em>, in the third dimension, does not have a <a href="Maxima_and_minima#Functions_of_more_than_one_variable" title="wikilink">local maximum</a> for any <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> values.) The negative slope of the indifference curve reflects the assumption of the monotonicity of consumer's preferences, which generates monotonically increasing utility functions, and the assumption of non-satiation (marginal utility for all goods is always positive); an upward sloping indifference curve would imply that a consumer is indifferent between a bundle A and another bundle B because they lie on the same indifference curve, even in the case in which the quantity of both goods in bundle B is higher. Because of monotonicity of preferences and non-satiation, a bundle with more of both goods must be preferred to one with less of both, thus the first bundle must yield a higher utility, and lie on a different indifference curve at a higher utility level. The negative slope of the indifference curve implies that the <a href="marginal_rate_of_substitution" title="wikilink">marginal rate of substitution</a> is always positive;</li>
<li><a href="Total_order" title="wikilink">Complete</a>, such that all points on an indifference curve are ranked equally preferred and ranked either more or less preferred than every other point not on the curve. So, with (2), no two curves can intersect (otherwise non-satiation would be violated).</li>
<li><a href="Transitive_relation#Examples" title="wikilink">Transitive</a> with respect to points on distinct indifference curves. That is, if each point on <em>I<sub>2</sub></em> is (strictly) preferred to each point on <em>I<sub>1</sub></em>, and each point on <em>I<sub>3</sub></em> is preferred to each point on <em>I<sub>2</sub></em>, each point on <em>I<sub>3</sub></em> is preferred to each point on <em>I<sub>1</sub></em>. A negative slope and transitivity exclude indifference curves crossing, since straight lines from the origin on both sides of where they crossed would give opposite and intransitive preference rankings.</li>
<li>(Strictly) <a href="convex_function" title="wikilink">convex</a>. With (2), <a href="convex_preferences" title="wikilink">convex preferences</a> imply that the indifference curves cannot be concave to the origin, i.e. they will either be straight lines or bulge toward the origin of the indifference curve. If the latter is the case, then as a consumer decreases consumption of one good in successive units, successively larger doses of the <a href="composite_good" title="wikilink">other good</a> are required to keep satisfaction unchanged.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assumptions-of-consumer-preference-theory">Assumptions of consumer preference theory</h2>
<ul>
<li>Preferences are <strong>complete</strong>. The consumer has ranked all available alternative combinations of commodities in terms of the satisfaction they provide him.
<ul>
<li>Assume that there are two consumption bundles A and B each containing two commodities x and y. A consumer can unambiguously determine that one and only one of the following is the case:
<ul>
<li>A is preferred to B ⇒ A <sup>p</sup> B<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></li>
<li>B is preferred to A ⇒ B <sup>p</sup> A<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
<li>A is indifferent to B ⇒ A <sup>I</sup> B<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>
<ul>
<li>Note that this axiom precludes the possibility that the consumer cannot decide,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and that a consumer is able to make this comparison with respect to every conceivable bundle of goods.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Preferences are <strong>reflexive</strong>
<ul>
<li>Means that if A and B are identical in all respects the consumer will recognize this fact and be indifferent in comparing A and B
<ul>
<li>A = B ⇒ A <sup>I</sup> B<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Preferences are <strong>transitive</strong><mtpl></mtpl>
<ul>
<li>If A <sup>p</sup> B and B <sup>p</sup> C then A <sup>p</sup> C.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></li>
<li>Also A <sup>I</sup> B and B <sup>I</sup> C then A<sup>I</sup> C.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>
<ul>
<li>This is a consistency assumption.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Preferences are <strong>continuous</strong>
<ul>
<li>If A is preferred to B and C is infinitesimally close to B then A is preferred to C.</li>
<li>A <sup>p</sup> B &amp; C → B ⇒ A <sup>p</sup> C.
<ul>
<li>"Continuous" means infinitely divisible - just like there are infinitely many numbers between 1 and 2 all bundles are infinitely divisible. This assumption makes indifference curves continuous.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Preferences exhibit <strong>strong monotonicity</strong>
<ul>
<li>if A has more of both x and y than B then A is preferred to B
<ul>
<li>this assumption is commonly called the "more is better" assumption</li>
<li>an alternative version of this assumption is strong monotonicity which requires that if A and B have the same quantity of one good, but A has more of the other, then A is preferred to B.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>It also implies that the commodities are <strong>good</strong> rather than <strong>bad</strong>. Examples of <strong>bad</strong> commodities can be disease, pollution etc. because we always desire less of such things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Indifference curves exhibit <strong>diminishing marginal rates of substitution</strong>
<ul>
<li>The marginal rate of substitution tells how much 'y' a person is willing to sacrifice to get one more unit of 'x'.</li>
<li>This assumption assures that indifference curves are smooth and convex to the origin.</li>
<li>This assumption also set the stage for using techniques of constrained optimization because the shape of the curve assures that the first derivative is negative and the second is positive.</li>
<li>Another name for this assumption is the <strong>substitution assumption</strong>. It is the most critical assumption of consumer theory: Consumers are willing to give up or trade-off some of one good to get more of another. The fundamental assertion is that there is a maximum amount that "a consumer will give up, of one commodity, to get one unit of another good, in that amount which will leave the consumer indifferent between the new and old situations"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The negative slope of the indifference curves represents the willingness of the consumer to make a trade off.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are also many sub-assumptions:
<ul>
<li>Irreflexivity - for no x is x<sup>p</sup>x</li>
<li>Negative transitivity - if x<sup>not-p</sup>y then for any third commodity z, either x<sup>not-p</sup>z or z<sup>not-p</sup>y or both.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<figcaption>To maximise utility, a household should consume at (Qx, Qy). Assuming it does, a full demand schedule can be deduced as the price of one good fluctuates.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><a href="Consumer_theory" title="wikilink">Consumer theory</a> uses indifference curves and budget constraints to generate <a href="Supply_and_demand" title="wikilink">consumer demand curves</a>. For a single consumer, this is a relatively simple process. First, let one good be an example market e.g., carrots, and let the other be a composite of all other goods. Budget constraints give a straight line on the indifference map showing all the possible distributions between the two goods; the point of maximum utility is then the point at which an indifference curve is tangent to the budget line (illustrated). This follows from common sense: if the market values a good more than the household, the household will sell it; if the market values a good less than the household, the household will buy it. The process then continues until the market's and household's marginal rates of substitution are equal.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Now, if the price of carrots were to change, and the price of all other goods were to remain constant, the gradient of the budget line would also change, leading to a different point of tangency and a different quantity demanded. These price / quantity combinations can then be used to deduce a full demand curve.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> A line connecting all points of tangency between the indifference curve and the <a href="budget_constraint" title="wikilink">budget constraint</a> is called the <a href="expansion_path" title="wikilink">expansion path</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> </p>

<p>In Figure 1, the consumer would rather be on <em>I<sub>3</sub></em> than <em>I<sub>2</sub></em>, and would rather be on <em>I<sub>2</sub></em> than <em>I<sub>1</sub></em>, but does not care where he/she is on a given indifference curve. The slope of an indifference curve (in absolute value), known by economists as the <a href="marginal_rate_of_substitution" title="wikilink">marginal rate of substitution</a>, shows the rate at which consumers are willing to give up one good in exchange for more of the other good. For <em>most</em> goods the marginal rate of substitution is not constant so their indifference curves are curved. The curves are convex to the origin, describing the negative <a href="substitution_effect" title="wikilink">substitution effect</a>. As price rises for a fixed money income, the consumer seeks less the expensive substitute at a lower indifference curve. The substitution effect is reinforced through the <a href="income_effect" title="wikilink">income effect</a> of lower real income (Beattie-LaFrance). An example of a utility function that generates indifference curves of this kind is the Cobb-Douglas function

<p>If two goods are <a href="complement_good" title="wikilink">perfect complements</a> then the indifference curves will be L-shaped. Examples of perfect complements include left shoes compared to right shoes: the consumer is no better off having several right shoes if she has only one left shoe - additional right shoes have zero marginal utility without more left shoes, so bundles of goods differing only in the number of right shoes they include - however many - are equally preferred. The marginal rate of substitution is either zero or infinite. An example of the type of utility function that has an indifference map like that above is the Leontief function

<h4 id="biology">Biology</h4>

<p>As used in <a class="uri" href="Biology" title="wikilink">Biology</a>, the indifference curve is a model for how animals 'decide' whether to perform a particular behavior, based on changes in two variables which can increase in intensity, one along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis. For example, the x-axis may measure the quantity of food available while the y-axis measures the risk involved in obtaining it. The indifference curve is drawn to predict the animal's behavior at various levels of risk and food availability.</p>
