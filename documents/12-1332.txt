   LogP machine      LogP machine   The LogP machine is a model for parallel computation . 1 It aims at being more practical than the PRAM model while still allowing for easy analysis of computation. The name is not related to the mathematical logarithmic function : Instead, the machine is described by the four parameters   L   L   L   ,   o   o   o   ,   g   g   g   and   P   P   P   .  The LogP machine consists of arbitrarily many processing units with distributed memory . The processing units are connected through an abstract communication medium which allows point-to-point communication. This model is pair-wise synchronous and overall asynchronous.  The machine is described by the four parameters:      L   L   L   , the latency of the communication medium.     o   o   o   , the overhead of sending and receiving a message.     g   g   g   , the gap required between two send/receive operations. A more common interpretation of this quantity is as the inverse of the bandwidth of a processor-processor communication channel.     P   P   P   , the number of processing units. Each local operation on each machine takes the same time ('unit time'). This time is called a processor cycle.   The units of the parameters   L   L   L   ,   o   o   o   and   g   g   g   are measured in multiples of processor cycles.
