   Thue equation      Thue equation   In mathematics , a Thue equation is a Diophantine equation of the form   ƒ ( x , y ) = r ,   where ƒ is an irreducible bivariate form of degree at least 3 over the rational numbers, and r is a nonzero rational number . It is named after Axel Thue who in 1909 proved a theorem , now called Thue's theorem , that a Thue equation has finitely many solutions in integers x and y . 1  The Thue equation is soluble effectively : there is an explicit bound on the solutions x , y of the form     (    C  1   r   )    C  2      superscript     subscript  C  1   r    subscript  C  2     (C_{1}r)^{C_{2}}   where constants C 1 and C 2 depend only on the form ƒ . A stronger result holds, that if K is the field generated by the roots of ƒ then the equation has only finitely many solutions with x and y integers of K and again these may be effectively determined. 2  Solving Thue equations  Solving a Thue equation can be described as an algorithm 3 ready for implementation in software. In particular, it is implemented in the following computer algebra systems :   in PARI/GP as functions thueinit() and thue() .  in Magma computer algebra system as functions ThueObject() and ThueSolve() .  in Mathematica through Reduce   References  Further reading     "  Category:Diophantine equations  Category:Theorems in number theory     ↩  ↩  ↩
