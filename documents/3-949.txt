   Polylogarithmic function      Polylogarithmic function   A polylogarithmic function in n is a polynomial in the logarithm of n ,         a  k     log  k    (  n  )     +  ⋯  +    a  1    log   (  n  )     +   a  0    .         subscript  a  k     superscript   k   n    normal-⋯     subscript  a  1     n     subscript  a  0     a_{k}\log^{k}(n)+\cdots+a_{1}\log(n)+a_{0}.\,     In computer science , polylogarithmic functions occur as the order of memory used by some algorithms (e.g., "it has polylogarithmic order").  All polylogarithmic functions are        P  ℓ    (  x  )    =   o   (   x  ε   )           subscript  P  normal-ℓ   x     o   superscript  x  ε      P_{\ell}(x)=o(x^{\varepsilon})\,     for every exponent ε > 0 (for the meaning of this symbol, see small o notation ), that is, a polylogarithmic function grows more slowly than any positive exponent. This observation is the basis for the soft O notation Õ( n ).  References     "  Category:Mathematical analysis  Category:Polynomials  Category:Analysis of algorithms
