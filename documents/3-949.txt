Polylogarithmic function

A polylogarithmic function in n is a polynomial in the logarithm of n,



In computer science, polylogarithmic functions occur as the order of memory used by some algorithms (e.g., "it has polylogarithmic order").
All polylogarithmic functions are



for every exponent ε > 0 (for the meaning of this symbol, see small o notation), that is, a polylogarithmic function grows more slowly than any positive exponent. This observation is the basis for the soft O notation Õ(n).
