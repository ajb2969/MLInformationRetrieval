Glucuronosyl-disulfoglucosamine glucuronidase

In enzymology, a glucuronosyl-disulfoglucosamine glucuronidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-D-glucuronosyl-N2,6-disulfo-beta-D-glucosamine + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-glucuronate + N2,6-disulfo-D-glucosamine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-D-glucuronosyl-N2,6-disulfo-beta-D-glucosamine and H2O, whereas its two products are D-glucuronate and N2,6-disulfo-D-glucosamine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, to be specific those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-D-glucuronsyl-N2,6-disulfo-beta-D-glucosamine glucuronohydrolase. Other names in common use include glycuronidase, and 3-D-glucuronsyl-2-N,6-disulfo-beta-D-glucosamine glucuronohydrolase.
