   Plane stress      Plane stress   In continuum mechanics , a material is said to be under plane stress if the stress vector is zero across a particular surface. When that situation occurs over an entire element of a structure, as is often the case for thin plates, the stress analysis is considerably simplified, as the stress state can be represented by a tensor of dimension 2 (representable as a 2 × 2 matrix rather than 3 × 3). 1 A related notion, plane strain , is often applicable to very thick members.  Plane stress typically occurs in thin flat plates that are acted upon only by load forces that are parallel to them. In certain situations, a gently curved thin plate may also be assumed to have plane stress for the purpose of stress analysis. This is the case, for example, of a thin-walled cylinder filled with a fluid under pressure. In such cases, stress components perpendicular to the plate are negligible compared to those parallel to it. 2  In other situations, however, the bending stress of a thin plate cannot be neglected. One can still simplify the analysis by using a two-dimensional domain, but the plane stress tensor at each point must be complemented with bending terms.  Mathematical definition  Mathematically, the stress at some point in the material is a plane stress if one of the three principal stresses (the eigenvalues of the Cauchy stress tensor ) is zero. That is, there is Cartesian coordinate system in which the stress tensor has the form      σ  =   [      σ  11     0    0      0     σ  22     0      0    0    0     ]   ≡   [      σ  x     0    0      0     σ  y     0      0    0    0     ]         σ     subscript  σ  11   0  0    0   subscript  σ  22   0    0  0  0            subscript  σ  x   0  0    0   subscript  σ  y   0    0  0  0       \sigma=\begin{bmatrix}\sigma_{11}&0&0\\
 0&\sigma_{22}&0\\
 0&0&0\end{bmatrix}\equiv\begin{bmatrix}\sigma_{x}&0&0\\
 0&\sigma_{y}&0\\
 0&0&0\end{bmatrix}     For example, consider a rectangular block of material measuring 10, 40 and 5 cm along the   x   x   x   ,   y   y   y   , and   z   z   z   , that is being stretched in the   x   x   x   direction and compressed in the   y   y   y   direction, by pairs of opposite forces with magnitudes 10 N and 20 N, respectively, uniformly distributed over the corresponding faces. The stress tensor inside the block will be      σ  =   [      500  P  a     0    0      0     -   4000  P  a      0      0    0    0     ]       σ      500  normal-P  normal-a   0  0    0      4000  normal-P  normal-a    0    0  0  0      \sigma=\begin{bmatrix}500\mathrm{Pa}&0&0\\
 0&-4000\mathrm{Pa}&0\\
 0&0&0\end{bmatrix}     More generally, if one chooses the first two coordinate axes arbitrarily but perpendicular to the direction of zero stress, the stress tensor will have the form      σ  =   [      σ  11      σ  12     0       σ  21      σ  22     0      0    0    0     ]   ≡   [      σ  x      τ   x  y      0       τ   y  x       σ  y     0      0    0    0     ]         σ     subscript  σ  11    subscript  σ  12   0     subscript  σ  21    subscript  σ  22   0    0  0  0            subscript  σ  x    subscript  τ    x  y    0     subscript  τ    y  x     subscript  σ  y   0    0  0  0       \sigma=\begin{bmatrix}\sigma_{11}&\sigma_{12}&0\\
 \sigma_{21}&\sigma_{22}&0\\
 0&0&0\end{bmatrix}\equiv\begin{bmatrix}\sigma_{x}&\tau_{xy}&0\\
 \tau_{yx}&\sigma_{y}&0\\
 0&0&0\end{bmatrix}   and can therefore be represented by a 2 × 2 matrix,       σ   i  j    =   [      σ  11      σ  12        σ  21      σ  22      ]   ≡   [      σ  x      τ   x  y         τ   y  x       σ  y      ]          subscript  σ    i  j       subscript  σ  11    subscript  σ  12      subscript  σ  21    subscript  σ  22             subscript  σ  x    subscript  τ    x  y       subscript  τ    y  x     subscript  σ  y        \sigma_{ij}=\begin{bmatrix}\sigma_{11}&\sigma_{12}\\

 \tau_{yx}&\sigma_{y}\end{bmatrix}     Constitutive equations   See Hooke's law#Plane_stress    Plane stress in curved surfaces  In certain cases, the plane stress model can be used in the analysis of gently curved surfaces. For example, consider a thin-walled cylinder subjected to an axial compressive load uniformly distributed along its rim, and filled with a pressurized fluid. The internal pressure will generate a reactive hoop stress on the wall, a normal tensile stress directed perpendicular to the cylinder axis and tangential to its surface. The cylinder can be conceptually unrolled and analyzed as a flat thin rectangular plate subjected to tensile load in one direction and compressive load in another other direction, both parallel to the plate.  Plane stress ( strain matrix )  If one dimension is very large compared to the others, the principal strain in the direction of the longest dimension is constrained and can be assumed as zero, yielding a plane strain condition (Figure 7.2). In this case, though all principal stresses are non-zero, the principal stress in the direction of the longest dimension can be disregarded for calculations. Thus, allowing a two dimensional analysis of stresses, e.g. a dam analyzed at a cross section loaded by the reservoir.  The corresponding strain tensor is:       ε   i  j    =   [      ε  11      ε  12     0       ε  21      ε  22     0      0    0     ε  33      ]        subscript  ε    i  j       subscript  ε  11    subscript  ε  12   0     subscript  ε  21    subscript  ε  22   0    0  0   subscript  ε  33       \varepsilon_{ij}=\begin{bmatrix}\varepsilon_{11}&\varepsilon_{12}&0\\
 \varepsilon_{21}&\varepsilon_{22}&0\\
 0&0&\varepsilon_{33}\end{bmatrix}\,\!     in which the non-zero    ε  33     subscript  ε  33    \varepsilon_{33}\,\!   term arises from the Poisson's effect . This strain term can be temporarily removed from the stress analysis to leave only the in-plane terms, effectively reducing the analysis to two dimensions. 3   Stress transformation in plane stress and plane strain  Consider a point   P   P   P\,\!   in a continuum under a state of plane stress, or plane strain, with stress components    (   σ  x   ,   σ  y   ,   τ   x  y    )      subscript  σ  x    subscript  σ  y    subscript  τ    x  y      (\sigma_{x},\sigma_{y},\tau_{xy})\,\!   and all other stress components equal to zero (Figure 8.1). From static equilibrium of an infinitesimal material element at   P   P   P\,\!   (Figure 8.2), the normal stress    σ  n     subscript  σ  normal-n    \sigma_{\mathrm{n}}\,\!   and the shear stress    τ  n     subscript  τ  normal-n    \tau_{\mathrm{n}}\,\!   on any plane perpendicular to the   x   x   x\,\!   -   y   y   y\,\!   plane passing through   P   P   P\,\!   with a unit vector   𝐧   𝐧   \mathbf{n}\,\!   making an angle of   θ   θ   \theta\,\!   with the horizontal, i.e.    cos  θ      θ    \cos\theta\,\!   is the direction cosine in the   x   x   x\,\!   direction, is given by:       σ  n   =     1  2    (    σ  x   +   σ  y    )    +    1  2    (    σ  x   -   σ  y    )    cos   2  θ     +    τ   x  y     sin   2  θ           subscript  σ  normal-n         1  2      subscript  σ  x    subscript  σ  y         1  2      subscript  σ  x    subscript  σ  y        2  θ        subscript  τ    x  y        2  θ        \sigma_{\mathrm{n}}=\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_{x}+\sigma_{y})+\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_{x}-%
 \sigma_{y})\cos 2\theta+\tau_{xy}\sin 2\theta\,\!          τ  n   =    -    1  2    (    σ  x   -   σ  y    )    sin   2  θ      +    τ   x  y     cos   2  θ           subscript  τ  normal-n           1  2      subscript  σ  x    subscript  σ  y        2  θ         subscript  τ    x  y        2  θ        \tau_{\mathrm{n}}=-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_{x}-\sigma_{y})\sin 2\theta+\tau_{xy}%
 \cos 2\theta\,\!     These equations indicate that in a plane stress or plane strain condition, one can determine the stress components at a point on all directions, i.e. as a function of   θ   θ   \theta\,\!   , if one knows the stress components    (   σ  x   ,   σ  y   ,   τ   x  y    )      subscript  σ  x    subscript  σ  y    subscript  τ    x  y      (\sigma_{x},\sigma_{y},\tau_{xy})\,\!   on any two perpendicular directions at that point. It is important to remember that we are considering a unit area of the infinitesimal element in the direction parallel to the   y   y   y\,\!   -   z   z   z\,\!   plane.  The principal directions (Figure 8.3), i.e., orientation of the planes where the shear stress components are zero, can be obtained by making the previous equation for the shear stress    τ  n     subscript  τ  normal-n    \tau_{\mathrm{n}}\,\!   equal to zero. Thus we have:       τ  n   =    -    1  2    (    σ  x   -   σ  y    )    sin   2  θ      +    τ   x  y     cos   2  θ      =  0         subscript  τ  normal-n           1  2      subscript  σ  x    subscript  σ  y        2  θ         subscript  τ    x  y        2  θ           0     \tau_{\mathrm{n}}=-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_{x}-\sigma_{y})\sin 2\theta+\tau_{xy}%
 \cos 2\theta=0\,\!     and we obtain       tan   2   θ  p     =    2   τ   x  y       σ  x   -   σ  y             2   subscript  θ  normal-p         2   subscript  τ    x  y        subscript  σ  x    subscript  σ  y       \tan 2\theta_{\mathrm{p}}=\frac{2\tau_{xy}}{\sigma_{x}-\sigma_{y}}\,\!     This equation defines two values    θ  p     subscript  θ  normal-p    \theta_{\mathrm{p}}\,\!   which are    90  ∘     superscript  90     90^{\circ}\,\!   apart (Figure 8.3). The same result can be obtained by finding the angle   θ   θ   \theta\,\!   which makes the normal stress    σ  n     subscript  σ  normal-n    \sigma_{\mathrm{n}}\,\!   a maximum, i.e.      d   σ  n     d  θ    =  0          d   subscript  σ  normal-n      d  θ    0    \frac{d\sigma_{\mathrm{n}}}{d\theta}=0\,\!     The principal stresses    σ  1     subscript  σ  1    \sigma_{1}\,\!   and    σ  2     subscript  σ  2    \sigma_{2}\,\!   , or minimum and maximum normal stresses    σ  max     subscript  σ  max    \sigma_{\mathrm{max}}\,\!   and    σ  min     subscript  σ  min    \sigma_{\mathrm{min}}\,\!   , respectively, can then be obtained by replacing both values of    θ  p     subscript  θ  normal-p    \theta_{\mathrm{p}}\,\!   into the previous equation for    σ  n     subscript  σ  normal-n    \sigma_{\mathrm{n}}\,\!   . This can be achieved by rearranging the equations for    σ  n     subscript  σ  normal-n    \sigma_{\mathrm{n}}\,\!   and    τ  n     subscript  τ  normal-n    \tau_{\mathrm{n}}\,\!   , first transposing the first term in the first equation and squaring both sides of each of the equations then adding them. Thus we have         [    σ  n   -     1  2     (    σ  x   +   σ  y    )     ]   2   +   τ  n  2    =     [     1  2     (    σ  x   -   σ  y    )    ]   2   +   τ   x  y   2           superscript   delimited-[]     subscript  σ  normal-n       1  2      subscript  σ  x    subscript  σ  y       2    superscript   subscript  τ  normal-n   2       superscript   delimited-[]      1  2      subscript  σ  x    subscript  σ  y      2    superscript   subscript  τ    x  y    2      \left[\sigma_{\mathrm{n}}-\tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_{x}+\sigma_{y})\right]^{2}+\tau_%
