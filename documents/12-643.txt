   Secant variety      Secant variety   In algebraic geometry , the Zariski closure of the union of the secant lines to a projective variety     X  ⊂   ℙ  n       X   superscript  ℙ  n     X\subset\mathbb{P}^{n}   is the first secant variety to   X   X   X   . It is usually denoted    Σ  1     subscript  normal-Σ  1    \Sigma_{1}   .  The     k   t  h      superscript  k    t  h     k^{th}   secant variety is the Zariski closure of the union of the linear spaces spanned by collections of k+1 points on   X   X   X   . It is usually denoted    Σ  k     subscript  normal-Σ  k    \Sigma_{k}   . Unless     Σ  k   =   ℙ  n        subscript  normal-Σ  k    superscript  ℙ  n     \Sigma_{k}=\mathbb{P}^{n}   , it is always singular along    Σ   k  -  1      subscript  normal-Σ    k  1     \Sigma_{k-1}   , but may have other singular points.  If   X   X   X   has dimension d, the dimension of    Σ  k     subscript  normal-Σ  k    \Sigma_{k}   is at most kd+d+k.
