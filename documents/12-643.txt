Secant variety

In algebraic geometry, the Zariski closure of the union of the secant lines to a projective variety

 
  is the first secant variety to 
 
 
 
 . It is usually denoted 
 
 
 
 .
The 

 
  secant variety is the Zariski closure of the union of the linear spaces spanned by collections of k+1 points on 
 
 
 
 . It is usually denoted 
 
 
 
 . Unless 
 
 
 
 , it is always singular along 
 
 
 
 , but may have other singular points.
If 
 
 
 
  has dimension d, the dimension of 
 
 
 
  is at most kd+d+k.
