   Killing spinor      Killing spinor   Killing spinor is a term used in mathematics and physics . By the more narrow definition, commonly used in mathematics, the term Killing spinor indicates those twistor spinors which are also eigenspinors of the Dirac operator . 1 2 3 The term is named after Wilhelm Killing .  Another equivalent definition is that Killing spinors are the solutions to the Killing equation for a so-called Killing number.  More formally: 4   A Killing spinor on a Riemannian  spin  manifold  M is a spinor field    ψ   ψ   \psi   which satisfies           ∇  X   ψ   =    λ  X   ⋅  ψ         subscript  normal-∇  X   ψ    normal-⋅    λ  X   ψ     \nabla_{X}\psi=\lambda X\cdot\psi         for all tangent vectors  X , where   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   is the spinor covariant derivative ,   ⋅   normal-⋅   \cdot   is Clifford multiplication and   λ   λ   \lambda   is a constant, called the Killing number of    ψ    ψ   \psi\,   . If    λ  =  0      λ  0    \lambda=0   then the spinor is called a parallel spinor.   In physics, Killing spinors are used in supergravity and superstring theory , in particular for finding solutions which preserve some supersymmetry . They are a special kind of spinor field related to Killing vector fields and Killing tensors .
