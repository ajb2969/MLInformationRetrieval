Killing spinor

Killing spinor is a term used in mathematics and physics. By the more narrow definition, commonly used in mathematics, the term Killing spinor indicates those twistor spinors which are also eigenspinors of the Dirac operator.123 The term is named after Wilhelm Killing.
Another equivalent definition is that Killing spinors are the solutions to the Killing equation for a so-called Killing number.
More formally:4

A Killing spinor on a Riemannian spin manifold M is a spinor field

 
  which satisfies
 










for all tangent vectors X, where 
 
 
 
  is the spinor covariant derivative, 
 
 
 
 
  is Clifford multiplication and 
 
 
 
  is a constant, called the Killing number of 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  then the spinor is called a parallel spinor.
 

In physics, Killing spinors are used in supergravity and superstring theory, in particular for finding solutions which preserve some supersymmetry. They are a special kind of spinor field related to Killing vector fields and Killing tensors.
