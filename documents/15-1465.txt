GDP-Man:Man2GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase

GDP-Man:Man2GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase (, GDP-Man:Man2GlcNAc2-PP-Dol alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase, Alg2 mannosyltransferase, ALG2 (gene), GDP-Man:Man1GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol mannosyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name GDP-D-mannose:D-Man-alpha-(1->3)-D-Man-beta-(1->4)-D-GlcNAc-beta-(1->4)-D-GlcNAc-diphosphodolichol alpha-6-mannosyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

GDP-D-mannose + D-Man-alpha-(1->3)-D-Man-beta-(1->4)-D-GlcNAc-beta-(1->4)-D-GlcNAc-diphosphodolichol 
 
 
 
  GDP + D-Man-alpha-(1->3)-[D-Man-alpha-(1->6)]-D-Man-beta-(1->4)-D-GlcNAc-beta-(1->4)-D-GlcNAc-diphosphodolichol
 

The biosynthesis of asparagine-linked glycoproteins utilizes a dolichyl diphosphate-linked glycosyl donor.
