Citrate CoA-transferase




Citrate CoA-transferase

In enzymology, a citrate CoA-transferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acetyl-CoA + citrate 
 
 
 
  acetate + (3S)-citryl-CoA
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and citrate, whereas its two products are acetate and (3S)-citryl-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the CoA-transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:citrate CoA-transferase. This enzyme participates in citrate cycle (tca cycle).
