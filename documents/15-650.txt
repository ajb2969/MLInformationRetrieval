Locally finite operator

In mathematics, a linear operator

 
  is called locally finite if the space

 
  is the union of a family of finite-dimensional 
 
 
 
 -invariant subspaces.
In other words, there exists a family 
 
 
 
  of linear subspaces of 
 
 
 
 , such that we have the following:







Each 
 
 
 
  is finite-dimensional.

Examples

Every linear operator on a finite-dimensional space is trivially locally finite.
Every diagonalizable (i.e. there exists a basis of 
 
 
 
  whose elements are all eigenvectors of 
 
 
 
 ) linear operator is locally finite, because it is the union of subspaces spanned by finitely many eigenvectors of 
 
 
 
 .
