   Locally finite operator      Locally finite operator   In mathematics , a linear operator     f  :   V  →  V      normal-:  f   normal-→  V  V     f:V\to V   is called locally finite if the space    V   V   V   is the union of a family of finite-dimensional   f   f   f   - invariant subspaces .  In other words, there exists a family    {   V  i   |   i  ∈  I   }     conditional-set   subscript  V  i     i  I     \{V_{i}|i\in I\}   of linear subspaces of   V   V   V   , such that we have the following:         ⋃   i  ∈  I     V  i    =  V        subscript     i  I     subscript  V  i    V    \bigcup_{i\in I}V_{i}=V          (  ∀  i  ∈  I  )   f   [   V  i   ]   ⊆   V  i      fragments   fragments  normal-(  for-all  i   I  normal-)   f   fragments  normal-[   subscript  V  i   normal-]     subscript  V  i     (\forall i\in I)f[V_{i}]\subseteq V_{i}     Each    V  i     subscript  V  i    V_{i}   is finite-dimensional.   Examples   Every linear operator on a finite-dimensional space is trivially locally finite.  Every diagonalizable (i.e. there exists a basis of   V   V   V   whose elements are all eigenvectors of   f   f   f   ) linear operator is locally finite, because it is the union of subspaces spanned by finitely many eigenvectors of   f   f   f   .
