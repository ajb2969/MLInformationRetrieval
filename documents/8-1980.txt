   Schoen–Yau conjecture      Schoen–Yau conjecture   In mathematics , the Schoen–Yau conjecture is a disproved conjecture in hyperbolic geometry , named after the mathematicians  Richard Schoen and Shing-Tung Yau .  It was inspired by a theorem of Erhard Heinz (1952). One method of disproof is the use of Scherk surfaces , as used by Harold Rosenberg and Pascal Collin (2006).  Setting and statement of the conjecture  Let   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   be the complex plane considered as a Riemannian manifold with its usual (flat) Riemannian metric. Let   ℍ   ℍ   \mathbb{H}   denote the hyperbolic plane , i.e. the unit disc      ℍ  :=   {    (  x  ,  y  )   ∈   ℝ  2    |     x  2   +   y  2    <  1   }      assign  ℍ   conditional-set     x  y    superscript  ℝ  2         superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    1      \mathbb{H}:=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^{2}|x^{2}+y^{2}<1\}     endowed with the hyperbolic metric        d   s  2    =   4     d   x  2    +   d   y  2       (   1  -   (    x  2   +   y  2    )    )   2      .        normal-d   superscript  s  2      4        normal-d   superscript  x  2      normal-d   superscript  y  2      superscript    1     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2     2       \mathrm{d}s^{2}=4\frac{\mathrm{d}x^{2}+\mathrm{d}y^{2}}{(1-(x^{2}+y^{2}))^{2}}.     E. Heinz proved in 1952 that there can exist no harmonic  diffeomorphism       f  :   ℍ  →  ℂ    .     normal-:  f   normal-→  ℍ  ℂ     f:\mathbb{H}\to\mathbb{C}.\,     In light of this theorem, Schoen conjectured that there exists no harmonic diffeomorphism       g  :   ℂ  →  ℍ    .     normal-:  g   normal-→  ℂ  ℍ     g:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{H}.\,     (It is not clear how Yau's name became associated with the conjecture: in unpublished correspondence with Harold Rosenberg, both Schoen and Yau identify Schoen as having postulated the conjecture). The Schoen(-Yau) conjecture has since been disproved.  Comments  The emphasis is on the existence or non-existence of an harmonic diffeomorphism, and that this property is a "one-way" property. In more detail: suppose that we consider two Riemannian manifolds M and N (with their respective metrics), and write      M  ∼   N      similar-to  M  N    M\sim N\,     if there exists a diffeomorphism from M onto N (in the usual terminology, M and N are diffeomorphic). Write      M  ∝  N     proportional-to  M  N    M\propto N     if there exists an harmonic diffeomorphism from M onto N . It is not difficult to show that   ∼   similar-to   \sim   (being diffeomorphic) is an equivalence relation on the objects of the category of Riemannian manifolds. In particular,   ∼   similar-to   \sim   is a symmetric relation :        M  ∼  N   ⇔   N  ∼  M    .     iff   similar-to  M  N    similar-to  N  M     M\sim N\iff N\sim M.     It can be shown that the hyperbolic plane and (flat) complex plane are indeed diffeomorphic:       ℍ  ∼  ℂ   ,     similar-to  ℍ  ℂ    \mathbb{H}\sim\mathbb{C},     so the question is whether or not they are "harmonically diffeomorphic". However, as the truth of Heinz's theorem and the falsity of the Schoen–Yau conjecture demonstrate,   ∝   proportional-to   \propto   is not a symmetric relation:       ℂ  ∝   ℍ  but  ℍ   ∝̸  ℂ   .       proportional-to  ℂ    ℍ  but  ℍ     not-proportional-to    ℂ     \mathbb{C}\propto\mathbb{H}\text{ but }\mathbb{H}\not\propto\mathbb{C}.     Thus, being "harmonically diffeomorphic" is a much stronger property than simply being diffeomorphic, and can be a "one-way" relation.
