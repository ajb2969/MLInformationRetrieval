   Tate duality      Tate duality   In mathematics , Tate duality or Poitou–Tate duality is a duality theorem for Galois cohomology groups of modules over the Galois group of an algebraic number field or local field , introduced by  and .  Local Tate duality  Local Tate duality says there is a perfect pairing of finite groups          H  r    (  k  ,  M  )    ×   H   2  -  r      (  k  ,   M  ′   )    →    H  2    (  k  ,   G  m   )    =   Q  /  Z        normal-→         superscript  H  r    k  M     superscript  H    2  r      k   superscript  M  normal-′        superscript  H  2    k   subscript  G  m            Q  Z      \displaystyle H^{r}(k,M)\times H^{2-r}(k,M^{\prime})\rightarrow H^{2}(k,G_{m})%
