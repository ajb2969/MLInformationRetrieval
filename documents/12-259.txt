Carathéodory's criterion

Carathéodory's criterion is a result in measure theory that was formulated by Greek mathematician Constantin Carathéodory. Its statement is as follows: Let 
 
 
 
  denote the Lebesgue outer measure on 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 
  is Lebesgue measurable if and only if 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
 . Notice that 
 
 
 
  is not required to be a measurable set.
