   Carathéodory's criterion      Carathéodory's criterion   Carathéodory's criterion is a result in measure theory that was formulated by Greek mathematician  Constantin Carathéodory . Its statement is as follows: Let    λ  *     superscript  λ     \lambda^{*}   denote the Lebesgue  outer measure on    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   , and let    E  ⊆   ℝ  n       E   superscript  ℝ  n     E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}   . Then   E   E   E   is Lebesgue measurable if and only if      λ  *    (  A  )    =     λ  *    (   A  ∩  E   )    +    λ  *    (   A  ∩   E  c    )            superscript  λ    A        superscript  λ      A  E       superscript  λ      A   superscript  E  c        \lambda^{*}(A)=\lambda^{*}(A\cap E)+\lambda^{*}(A\cap E^{c})   for every    A  ⊆   ℝ  n       A   superscript  ℝ  n     A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}   . Notice that   A   A   A   is not required to be a measurable set.  See also   Carathéodory's theorem   "  Category:Measure theory
