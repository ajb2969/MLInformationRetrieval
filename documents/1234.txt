   Pseudo-differential operator      Pseudo-differential operator   In mathematical analysis a pseudo-differential operator is an extension of the concept of differential operator . Pseudo-differential operators are used extensively in the theory of partial differential equations and quantum field theory .  History  The study of pseudo-differential operators began in the mid 1960s with the work of Kohn , Nirenberg , Hörmander , Unterberger and Bokobza. They played an influential role in the first proof of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem . Atiyah and Singer thanked Hörmander for assistance with understanding the theory of Pseudo-differential operators.  Motivation  Linear differential operators with constant coefficients  Consider a linear differential operator with constant coefficients,       P   (  D  )    :=    ∑  α      a  α     D  α        assign    P  D     subscript   α      subscript  a  α    superscript  D  α       P(D):=\sum_{\alpha}a_{\alpha}\,D^{\alpha}     which acts on smooth functions   u   u   u   with compact support in R n . This operator can be written as a composition of a Fourier transform , a simple multiplication by the polynomial function (called the symbol )        P   (  ξ  )    =    ∑  α      a  α     ξ  α      ,        P  ξ     subscript   α      subscript  a  α    superscript  ξ  α       P(\xi)=\sum_{\alpha}a_{\alpha}\,\xi^{\alpha},     and an inverse Fourier transform, in the form:  Here,    α  =   (   α  1   ,  …  ,   α  n   )       α    subscript  α  1   normal-…   subscript  α  n      \alpha=(\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{n})   is a multi-index ,    a  α     subscript  a  α    a_{\alpha}   are complex numbers, and       D  α   =     (   -   i   ∂  1     )    α  1    ⋯    (   -   i   ∂  n     )    α  n          superscript  D  α      superscript      i   subscript   1      subscript  α  1    normal-⋯   superscript      i   subscript   n      subscript  α  n       D^{\alpha}=(-i\partial_{1})^{\alpha_{1}}\cdots(-i\partial_{n})^{\alpha_{n}}     is an iterated partial derivative, where ∂ j means differentiation with respect to the j -th variable. We introduce the constants    -  i      i    -i   to facilitate the calculation of Fourier transforms.   Derivation of formula ()   The Fourier transform of a smooth function u , compactly supported in R n , is        u  ^    (  ξ  )    :=   ∫    e   -   i  y  ξ     u   (  y  )   d  y       assign     normal-^  u   ξ        superscript  e      i  y  ξ     u  y  d  y      \hat{u}(\xi):=\int e^{-iy\xi}u(y)\,dy     and Fourier's inversion formula gives       u   (  x  )    =    1    (   2  π   )   n     ∫    e   i  x  ξ     u  ^    (  ξ  )   d  ξ     =    1    (   2  π   )   n     ∬    e   i   (   x  -  y   )   ξ    u   (  y  )   d   y   d  ξ             u  x       1   superscript    2  π   n         superscript  e    i  x  ξ     normal-^  u   ξ  d  ξ              1   superscript    2  π   n     double-integral     superscript  e    i    x  y   ξ    u  y  d  y  d  ξ        u(x)=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n}}\int e^{ix\xi}\hat{u}(\xi)d\xi=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n}}%
 \iint e^{i(x-y)\xi}u(y)\,dy\,d\xi     By applying P ( D ) to this representation of u and using       P   (   D  x   )    e   i   (   x  -  y   )   ξ     =     e   i   (   x  -  y   )   ξ     P   (  ξ  )          P   subscript  D  x    superscript  e    i    x  y   ξ        superscript  e    i    x  y   ξ    P  ξ     P(D_{x})\,e^{i(x-y)\xi}=e^{i(x-y)\xi}\,P(\xi)     one obtains formula ().  Representation of solutions to partial differential equations  To solve the partial differential equation       P   (  D  )   u   =  f        P  D  u   f    P(D)\,u=f     we (formally) apply the Fourier transform on both sides and obtain the algebraic equation        P   (  ξ  )    u  ^    (  ξ  )    =    f  ^    (  ξ  )     .        P  ξ   normal-^  u   ξ      normal-^  f   ξ     P(\xi)\,\hat{u}(\xi)=\hat{f}(\xi).     If the symbol P (ξ) is never zero when ξ ∈ R n , then it is possible to divide by P (ξ):        u  ^    (  ξ  )    =    1   P   (  ξ  )      f  ^    (  ξ  )           normal-^  u   ξ       1    P  ξ     normal-^  f   ξ     \hat{u}(\xi)=\frac{1}{P(\xi)}\hat{f}(\xi)     By Fourier's inversion formula, a solution is        u   (  x  )    =    1    (   2  π   )   n     ∫    e   i  x  ξ     1   P   (  ξ  )      f  ^    (  ξ  )   d  ξ      .        u  x       1   superscript    2  π   n         superscript  e    i  x  ξ      1    P  ξ     normal-^  f   ξ  d  ξ       u(x)=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n}}\int e^{ix\xi}\frac{1}{P(\xi)}\hat{f}(\xi)\,d\xi.     Here it is assumed that:   P ( D ) is a linear differential operator with constant coefficients,  its symbol P (ξ) is never zero,  both u and ƒ have a well defined Fourier transform.   The last assumption can be weakened by using the theory of distributions . The first two assumptions can be weakened as follows.  In the last formula, write out the Fourier transform of ƒ to obtain        u   (  x  )    =    1    (   2  π   )   n     ∬    e   i   (   x  -  y   )   ξ     1   P   (  ξ  )     f   (  y  )   d   y   d  ξ      .        u  x       1   superscript    2  π   n     double-integral     superscript  e    i    x  y   ξ      1    P  ξ    f  y  d  y  d  ξ       u(x)=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n}}\iint e^{i(x-y)\xi}\frac{1}{P(\xi)}f(y)\,dy\,d\xi.     This is similar to formula (), except that 1/ P (ξ) is not a polynomial function, but a function of a more general kind.  Definition of pseudo-differential operators  Here we view pseudo-differential operators as a generalization of differential operators. We extend formula (1) as follows. A pseudo-differential operator  P ( x , D ) on R n is an operator whose value on the function u(x) is the function of x :  where     u  ^    (  ξ  )        normal-^  u   ξ    \hat{u}(\xi)   is the Fourier transform of u and the symbol P ( x ,ξ) in the integrand belongs to a certain symbol class . For instance, if P ( x ,ξ) is an infinitely differentiable function on R n × R n with the property       |      ∂  ξ  α    ∂  x  β    P    (  x  ,  ξ  )    |   ≤     C   α  ,  β       (   1  +   |  ξ  |    )    m  -   |  α  |                 superscript   subscript   ξ   α    superscript   subscript   x   β    P    x  ξ        subscript  C   α  β     superscript    1    ξ      m    α        |\partial_{\xi}^{\alpha}\partial_{x}^{\beta}P(x,\xi)|\leq C_{\alpha,\beta}\,(1%
 +|\xi|)^{m-|\alpha|}     for all x ,ξ ∈ R n , all multiindices α,β. some constants C α, β and some real number m , then P belongs to the symbol class    S   1  ,  0   m     subscript   superscript  S  m    1  0     \scriptstyle{S^{m}_{1,0}}   of Hörmander . The corresponding operator P ( x , D ) is called a pseudo-differential operator of order m and belongs to the class     Ψ   1  ,  0   m   .     subscript   superscript  normal-Ψ  m    1  0     \scriptstyle{\Psi^{m}_{1,0}}.     Properties  Linear differential operators of order m with smooth bounded coefficients are pseudo-differential operators of order m . The composition PQ of two pseudo-differential operators P , Q is again a pseudo-differential operator and the symbol of PQ can be calculated by using the symbols of P and Q . The adjoint and transpose of a pseudo-differential operator is a pseudo-differential operator.  If a differential operator of order m is (uniformly) elliptic (of order m ) and invertible, then its inverse is a pseudo-differential operator of order − m , and its symbol can be calculated. This means that one can solve linear elliptic differential equations more or less explicitly by using the theory of pseudo-differential operators.  Differential operators are local in the sense that one only needs the value of a function in a neighbourhood of a point to determine the effect of the operator. Pseudo-differential operators are pseudo-local , which means informally that when applied to a distribution they do not create a singularity at points where the distribution was already smooth.  Just as a differential operator can be expressed in terms of D = −id/d x in the form      p   (  x  ,  D  )       p   x  D     p(x,D)\,     for a polynomial  p in D (which is called the symbol ), a pseudo-differential operator has a symbol in a more general class of functions. Often one can reduce a problem in analysis of pseudo-differential operators to a sequence of algebraic problems involving their symbols, and this is the essence of microlocal analysis .  Kernel of pseudo-differential operator  Viewed as a mapping, a pseudo-differential operator can be represented by a kernel . The singularity of the kernel on the diagonal depends on the degree of the corresponding operator. In fact, if the symbol satisfies the above differential inequalities with m ≤ 0, it can be shown that the kernel is a singular integral kernel . The kernels can be used for characterization of boundary data for inverse boundary problems.
