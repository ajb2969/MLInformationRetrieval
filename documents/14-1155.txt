Standard Litres Per Minute

Standard Liter per Minute (SLM or SLPM) is the volumetric flow rate of a gas corrected to "standardized" conditions of temperature and pressure.
SLPM can be converted to SI units using the following formula:


 
 ,
assuming the same standard conditions for temperature and pressure, which can vary considerably between different fields of science and engineering.
Conventionally, the preferred unit for volumetric flow rate is actually cubic metres per second, where one cubic metre per second is equivalent to 60,000 litres per minute.
