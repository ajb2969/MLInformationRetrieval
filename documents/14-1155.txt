   Standard Litres Per Minute      Standard Litres Per Minute   Standard Liter per Minute (SLM or SLPM) is the volumetric flow rate of a gas corrected to "standardized" conditions of temperature and pressure .  SLPM can be converted to SI units using the following formula:       1  S  L  P  M   =   1     standard   litre   minute    =   1.68875    Pa  ⋅   m  3    s            1  normal-S  normal-L  normal-P  normal-M     1      standard  litre   minute           1.68875     normal-⋅  Pa   superscript  normal-m  3    normal-s       1\mathrm{SLPM}=1\frac{\mathrm{standard\,litre}}{\mathrm{minute}}=1.68875\frac{%
 \mathrm{Pa\cdot m^{3}}}{\mathrm{s}}   ,  assuming the same standard conditions for temperature and pressure , which can vary considerably between different fields of science and engineering.  Conventionally, the preferred unit for volumetric flow rate is actually cubic metres per second , where one cubic metre per second is equivalent to 60,000 litres per minute.
