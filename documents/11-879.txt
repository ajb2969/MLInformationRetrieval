   Cysteine-S-conjugate N-acetyltransferase      Cysteine-S-conjugate N-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a cysteine-S-conjugate N-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + an S-substituted L-cysteine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + an S-substituted N-acetyl-L-cysteine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and S-substituted L-cysteine , whereas its two products are CoA and S-substituted N-acetyl-L-cysteine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:S-substituted L-cysteine N-acetyltransferase . This enzyme participates in glutathione metabolism .
