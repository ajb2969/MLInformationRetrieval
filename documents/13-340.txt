   Turán–Kubilius inequality      Turán–Kubilius inequality   The Turán–Kubilius inequality is a mathematical theorem in probabilistic number theory . It is useful for proving results about the normal order of an arithmetic function . 1 The theorem was proved in a special case in 1934 by Pál Turán and generalized in 1956 and 1964 by Jonas Kubilius . 2  Statement of the theorem  This formulation is from Tenenbaum. 3 Other formulations are in Narkiewicz 4 and in Cojocaru & Murty. 5  Suppose f is an additive complex-valued arithmetic function , and write p for an arbitrary prime and   ν   ν   ν   for an arbitrary positive integer. Write       A   (  x  )    =    ∑    p  ν   ≤  x     f   (   p  ν   )    p   -  ν     (   1  -   p   -  1     )           A  x     subscript      superscript  p  ν   x      f   superscript  p  ν    superscript  p    ν      1   superscript  p    1         A(x)=\sum_{p^{\nu}\leq x}f(p^{\nu})p^{-\nu}(1-p^{-1})     and        B    (  x  )   2    =    ∑    p  ν   ≤  x       |   f   (   p  ν   )    |   2    p   -  ν       .        B   superscript  x  2      subscript      superscript  p  ν   x       superscript      f   superscript  p  ν     2    superscript  p    ν        B(x)^{2}=\sum_{p^{\nu}\leq x}\left|f(p^{\nu})\right|^{2}p^{-\nu}.     Then there is a function ε( x ) that goes to zero when x goes to infinity, and such that for x ≥ 2 we have         1  x     ∑   n  ≤  x      |    f   (  n  )    -   A   (  x  )     |   2     ≤    (   2  +   ε   (  x  )     )   B    (  x  )   2     .          1  x     subscript     n  x     superscript        f  n     A  x     2         2    ε  x    B   superscript  x  2      \frac{1}{x}\sum_{n\leq x}|f(n)-A(x)|^{2}\leq(2+\varepsilon(x))B(x)^{2}.     Applications of the theorem  Turán developed the inequality to create a simpler proof of the Hardy–Ramanujan theorem about the normal order of the number ω( n ) of distinct prime divisors of an integer n . 6 There is an exposition of Turán's proof in Hardy & Wright, §22.11. 7 Tenenbaum 8 gives a proof of the Hardy–Ramanujan theorem using the Turán–Kubilus inequality and states without proof several other applications.
