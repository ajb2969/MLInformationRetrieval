  |- !Orthogonal projections in BC5 Coxeter plane |} In six-dimensional geometry, a cantellated 5-cube is a convex uniform 5-polytope, being a cantellation of the regular 5-cube.
There are 6 unique cantellation for the 5-cube, including truncations. Half of them are more easily constructed from the dual 5-orthoplex
