Acyl-lysine deacylase

In enzymology, an acyl-lysine deacylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N6-acyl-L-lysine + H2O 
 
 
 
  a carboxylate + L-lysine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N6-acyl-L-lysine and H2O, whereas its two products are carboxylate and L-lysine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6-acyl-L-lysine amidohydrolase. Other names in common use include epsilon-lysine acylase, and 6-N-acyl-L-lysine amidohydrolase. This enzyme participates in lysine degradation.
