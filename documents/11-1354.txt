   Procollagen glucosyltransferase      Procollagen glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a procollagen glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + 5-(D-galactosyloxy)-L-lysine-procollagen   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 1,2-D-glucosyl-5-D-(galactosyloxy)-L-lysine-procollagen   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and 5-(D-galactosyloxy)-L-lysine-procollagen , whereas its two products are UDP and 1,2-D-glucosyl-5-D-(galactosyloxy)-L-lysine-procollagen .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:5-(D-galactosyloxy)-L-lysine-procollagen D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include galactosylhydroxylysine glucosyltransferase , collagen glucosyltransferase , collagen hydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase , galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase , UDP-glucose-collagenglucosyltransferase , and uridine diphosphoglucose-collagen glucosyltransferase .
