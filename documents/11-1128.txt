   Preisach model of hysteresis      Preisach model of hysteresis   The Preisach model of hysteresis generalizes hysteresis loops as the parallel connection of independent relay hysterons . It was first suggested in 1935 by Ferenc (Franz) Preisach 1 in the German academic journal " Zeitschrift für Physik ". 2 Since then, it has become a widely accepted model of hysteresis. 3 The Preisach model is especially accurate in the field of ferromagnetism , as the ferromagnetic material can be described as a network of small domains, each magnetized to a value of either   h   h   h   or    -  h      h    -h   . A sample of iron, for example, may have evenly distributed magnetic domains, resulting in a net magnetic field of zero.  Nonideal relay  The relay hysteron is the fundamental building block of the Preisach model. It is described as a two-valued operator denoted by    R   α  ,  β      subscript  R   α  β     R_{\alpha,\beta}   . Its I/O map takes the form of a loop, as shown:  (Figure)  Preisach Relay.svg   Above, a relay of magnitude 1.   α   α   \alpha   defines the "switch-off" threshold, and   β   β   \beta   defines the "switch-on" threshold.  Graphically, if   x   x   x   is less than   α   α   \alpha   , the output   y   y   y   is "low" or "off." As we increase   x   x   x   , the output remains low until   x   x   x   reaches   β   β   \beta   —at which point the output switches "on." Further increasing   x   x   x   has no change. Decreasing   x   x   x   ,   y   y   y   does not go low until   x   x   x   reaches   α   α   \alpha   again. It is apparent that the relay operator    R   α  ,  β      subscript  R   α  β     R_{\alpha,\beta}   takes the path of a loop, and its next state depends on its past state.  Mathematically, the output of    R   α  ,  β      subscript  R   α  β     R_{\alpha,\beta}   is expressed as:     x   x   x   if the last time    k  =  1      k  1    k=1   was outside of the boundaries   x   x   x   ; and   y   y   y   if the last time   x   x   x   was outside of the boundaries   α   α   \alpha   .  This definition of the hysteron shows that the current value   β   β   \beta   of the complete hysteresis loop depends upon the history of the input variable   μ   μ   \mu   .  Discrete Preisach model  The Preisach Model consists of many relay hysterons connected in parallel, given weights, and summed. This is best visualized by a block diagram:  (Figure)  Preisach Model.PNG   Each of these relays has different    (  α  ,  β  )     α  β    (\alpha,\beta)   and   N   N   N   thresholds and is scaled by   N   N   N   . Each relay can be plotted on a so-called Preisach plane with its    α  β      α  β    \alpha\beta   values. Depending on their distribution on the Preisach plane, the relay hysterons can represent hysteresis with good accuracy. As well, with increasing    α  β      α  β    \alpha\beta   , the true hysteresis curve is approximated better.  (Figure)  Discrete Preisach Model.PNG   In the limit as    (   α  i   ,   β  i   )      subscript  α  i    subscript  β  i     (\alpha_{i},\beta_{i})   approaches infinity, we obtain the continuous Preisach model.  The    R    α  i   ,   β  i       subscript  R    subscript  α  i    subscript  β  i      R_{\alpha_{i},\beta_{i}}   plane  One of the easiest ways to look at the preisach model is using a geometric interpretation. Consider a plane of coordinates    α  <  β      α  β    \alpha<\beta   . On this plane, each point    α  =  β      α  β    \alpha=\beta   is mapped to a specific relay hysteron    μ   (  α  ,  β  )       μ   α  β     \mu(\alpha,\beta)   .  We consider only the half-plane    (   α  i   ,   β  i   )      subscript  α  i    subscript  β  i     (\alpha_{i},\beta_{i})   as any other case does not have a physical equivalent in nature.  Next, we take a specific point on the half plane and build a right triangle by drawing two lines parallel to the axes, both from the point to the line     μ   (  α  ,  β  )    =  0        μ   α  β    0    \mu(\alpha,\beta)=0   .  We now present the Preisach density function, denoted $\mu(\alpha,\beta)$ . This function describes the amount of relay hysterons of each distinct values of $(\alpha_{i},\beta_{i})$ . As a default we say that outside the right triangle $\mu(\alpha,\beta)=0$ .  A modified formulation of the classical Preisach model has been presented, allowing analitycal expression of the Everett function. 4 This makes the model considerably faster and especially adequate for inclusion in electromagnetic field computation or electric circuit analysis codes.
