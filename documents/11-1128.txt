Preisach model of hysteresis

The Preisach model of hysteresis generalizes hysteresis loops as the parallel connection of independent relay hysterons. It was first suggested in 1935 by Ferenc (Franz) Preisach1 in the German academic journal "Zeitschrift für Physik".2 Since then, it has become a widely accepted model of hysteresis.3 The Preisach model is especially accurate in the field of ferromagnetism, as the ferromagnetic material can be described as a network of small domains, each magnetized to a value of either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 . A sample of iron, for example, may have evenly distributed magnetic domains, resulting in a net magnetic field of zero.
Nonideal relay
The relay hysteron is the fundamental building block of the Preisach model. It is described as a two-valued operator denoted by 
 
 
 
 . Its I/O map takes the form of a loop, as shown:

Above, a relay of magnitude 1. 
 
 
 
 
  defines the "switch-off" threshold, and 
 
 
 
  defines the "switch-on" threshold.
Graphically, if 
 
 
 
  is less than 
 
 
 
 , the output 
 
 
 
  is "low" or "off." As we increase 
 
 
 
 
 , the output remains low until 
 
 
 
  reaches 
 
 
 
 —at which point the output switches "on." Further increasing 
 
 
 
  has no change. Decreasing 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  does not go low until 
 
 
 
  reaches 
 
 
 
  again. It is apparent that the relay operator 
 
 
 
  takes the path of a loop, and its next state depends on its past state.
Mathematically, the output of 
 
 
 
  is expressed as:


 
 
  if the last time 
 
 
 
  was outside of the boundaries 
 
 
 
 ; and 
 
 
 
  if the last time 
 
 
 
  was outside of the boundaries 
 
 
 
 
 .
This definition of the hysteron shows that the current value 
 
 
 
  of the complete hysteresis loop depends upon the history of the input variable 
 
 
 
 .
Discrete Preisach model
The Preisach Model consists of many relay hysterons connected in parallel, given weights, and summed. This is best visualized by a block diagram:

Each of these relays has different 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  thresholds and is scaled by 
 
 
 
 
 . Each relay can be plotted on a so-called Preisach plane with its 
 
 
 
  values. Depending on their distribution on the Preisach plane, the relay hysterons can represent hysteresis with good accuracy. As well, with increasing 
 
 
 
 , the true hysteresis curve is approximated better.

In the limit as 
 
 
 
  approaches infinity, we obtain the continuous Preisach model.
The 
 
 
 
  plane
One of the easiest ways to look at the preisach model is using a geometric interpretation. Consider a plane of coordinates 
 
 
 
 
 . On this plane, each point 
 
 
 
  is mapped to a specific relay hysteron 
 
 
 
 .
We consider only the half-plane 
 
 
 
  as any other case does not have a physical equivalent in nature.
Next, we take a specific point on the half plane and build a right triangle by drawing two lines parallel to the axes, both from the point to the line 
 
 
 
 .
We now present the Preisach density function, denoted $\mu(\alpha,\beta)$. This function describes the amount of relay hysterons of each distinct values of $(\alpha_{i},\beta_{i})$. As a default we say that outside the right triangle $\mu(\alpha,\beta)=0$.
A modified formulation of the classical Preisach model has been presented, allowing analitycal expression of the Everett function.4 This makes the model considerably faster and especially adequate for inclusion in electromagnetic field computation or electric circuit analysis codes.
