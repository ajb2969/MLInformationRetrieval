   Photoacoustic imaging      Photoacoustic imaging   (Figure)  Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of photoacoustic imaging.   (Figure)  3D photoacoustic imaging of melanoma in vivo . 1   Photoacoustic imaging , as a hybrid biomedical imaging modality, is developed based on the photoacoustic effect . In photoacoustic imaging, non-ionizing laser pulses are delivered into biological tissues (when radio frequency pulses are used, the technology is referred to as thermoacoustic imaging ). Some of the delivered energy will be absorbed and converted into heat, leading to transient thermoelastic expansion and thus wideband (i.e. MHz) ultrasonic emission. The generated ultrasonic waves are detected by ultrasonic transducers and then analyzed to produce images. It is known that optical absorption is closely associated with physiological properties, such as hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation . 2 As a result, the magnitude of the ultrasonic emission (i.e. photoacoustic signal), which is proportional to the local energy deposition, reveals physiologically specific optical absorption contrast. 2D or 3D images of the targeted areas can then be formed. 3 Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration showing the basic principles of photoacoustic imaging.  The optical absorption in biological tissues can be due to endogenous molecules such as hemoglobin or melanin , or exogenously delivered contrast agents. As an example, Fig. 2 shows the optical absorption spectra of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO 2 ) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) in the visible and near infrared region. 4 Since blood usually has orders of magnitude higher absorption than surrounding tissues, there is sufficient endogenous contrast for photoacoustic imaging to visualize blood vessels. Recent studies have shown that photoacoustic imaging can be used in vivo for tumor angiogenesis monitoring, blood oxygenation mapping, functional brain imaging, skin melanoma detection, methemoglobin measuring, etc. 5  Advantages       Δf   Primary contrast   Δz   δz   δx   Speed        Hz    mm   µm   µm   Mvx/s     Photoacoustic microscopy   50 M   Optical absorption   3   15   45   0.5     Photoacoustic tomography   5 M   Optical absorption   50   700   700   0.5     Confocal microscopy    Fluorescence, scattering   0.2   3-20   0.3-3   10-100     Two-photon microscopy    Fluorescence   0.5-1.0   1-10   0.3-3   10-100     Optical coherence tomography   300 T   Optical scattering   1-2   0.5-10   1-10   20-4.000     Scanning Laser Acoustic Microscopy   300 M   Ultrasonic scattering   1-2   20   20   10     Acoustic microscopy   50 M   Ultrasonic scattering   20   20-100   80-160   0.1     Ultrasonography   5 M   Ultrasonic scattering   60   300   300   1     Table 1.

Speeds in mega voxel per second of non-parallel techniques.     Imaging systems  Two types of photoacoustic imaging systems, photoacoustic/thermoacoustic computed tomography (also known as photoacoustic/thermoacoustic tomography, i.e., PAT/TAT) and photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), have been developed. A typical PAT system uses an unfocused ultrasound detector to acquire the photoacoustic signals, and the image is reconstructed by inversely solving the photoacoustic equations. A PAM system, on the other hand, uses a spherically focused ultrasound detector with 2D point-by-point scanning, and requires no reconstruction algorithm.  Photoacoustic/thermoacoustic/optoacoustic computed tomography (PAT/TAT/OAT)  General equation  Given the heating function    H   (   r  →   ,  t  )       H    normal-→  r   t     H(\vec{r},t)   , the generation and propagation of photoacoustic wave pressure    p   (   r  →   ,  t  )       p    normal-→  r   t     p(\vec{r},t)   in an acoustically homogeneous inviscid medium is governed by           ∇  2   p    (   r  →   ,  t  )    -    1   v  s  2      ∂  2    ∂   t  2     p   (   r  →   ,  t  )     =    -    β   C  p     ∂   ∂  t    H   (   r  →   ,  t  )      (  1  )     ,            superscript  normal-∇  2   p     normal-→  r   t        1   superscript   subscript  v  s   2       superscript   2      superscript  t  2     p    normal-→  r   t            β   subscript  C  p         t    H    normal-→  r   t     1     \nabla^{2}p(\vec{r},t)-\frac{1}{v_{s}^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial{t^{2}}}%

Eq. (1) holds under thermal confinement to ensure that heat conduction is negligible during the laser pulse excitation. The thermal confinement occurs when the laser pulsewidth is much shorter than the thermal relaxation time. 6  The forward solution of Eq.

 \,\,\,(2).     In stress confinement, which occurs when the laser pulsewidth is much shorter than the stress relaxation time, 7 Eq.

Universal reconstruction algorithm  In a PAT system, the acoustic pressure is detected by scanning an ultrasonic transducer over a surface that encloses the photoacoustic source. To reconstruct the internal source distribution, we need to solve the inverse problem of equation (3) (i.e. to obtain    p  0     subscript  p  0    p_{0}   ). A representative method applied for PAT reconstruction is known as the universal backprojection algorithm. 8 This method is suitable for three imaging geometries: planar, spherical, and cylindrical surfaces.  The universal backprojection formula is          p  0    (   r  →   )    =       ∫   Ω  0       d   Ω  0     Ω  0     [    2  p   (    r  0   →   ,    v  s   t   )    -   2   v  s   t     ∂  p    (    r  0   →   ,    v  s   t   )     ∂   (    v  s   t   )       ]     |    t  =    |    r  →   -    r  0   →    |   /   v  s      ,   (  4  )     ,         subscript  p  0    normal-→  r      evaluated-at    subscript    subscript  normal-Ω  0          d   subscript  normal-Ω  0     subscript  normal-Ω  0     delimited-[]      2  p    normal-→   subscript  r  0       subscript  v  s   t       2   subscript  v  s   t        p     normal-→   subscript  r  0       subscript  v  s   t          subscript  v  s   t            t         normal-→  r    normal-→   subscript  r  0       subscript  v  s      4     \left.p_{0}(\vec{r})=\int_{\Omega_{0}}\frac{d\Omega_{0}}{\Omega_{0}}\left[2p(%

The laser beam is expanded and diffused to cover the whole region of interest. Photoacoustic waves are generated proportional to the distribution of optical absorption in the target, and are detected by a single scanned ultrasonic transducer. A TAT/OAT system is the same as PAT except that it uses a microwave excitation source instead of a laser. A typical TAT system is shown in the right part of Fig. 3. Although single-element transducers have been employed in these two systems, the detection scheme can be extended to use ultrasound arrays as well.  (Figure)  Fig. 3. Schematic of single-element transducer PAT/TAT system. 9 10   Biomedical applications of PAT and TAT  Intrinsic optical or microwave absorption contrast and diffraction-limited high spatial resolution of ultrasound make PAT and TAT promising imaging modalities for wide biomedical applications:  Brain lesion detection 11  (Figure)  Fig. 4. PAT imaging of rat brain lesion in situ . 12   Soft tissues with different optical absorption properties in the brain can be clearly identified by PAT. For example, the absorption contrast between the lesion area and the background parenchyma is significant as shown in Fig. 4(a). Fig. 4(b) is the corresponding open-skull photograph after experiment.  Hemodynamics monitoring 13 14  Since HbO 2 and Hb are the dominant absorbing compounds in biological tissues in the visible spectral range, multiple wavelength photoacoustic measurements can be used to reveal the relative concentration of these two chromophores . Thus, the relative total concentration of hemoglobin (HbT) and the hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sO 2 ) can be derived. Therefore, cerebral hemodynamic changes associated with brain function can be successfully detected with PAT.  (Figure)  Fig. 5. Cerebral hemodynamic changes in response to whisker stimulation. 15   (Figure)  Fig. 6. Image of the sO2 and HbT change in the cortical venous vessels between different physiological status. 16   Fig. 5 is the functional imaging of cerebral hemodynamic changes in response to whisker stimulation. In Fig.5, (a) is the noninvasive PAT image of the vascular pattern in the superficial layer of the rat cortex acquired with the skin and skull intact. (b) and (c) are functional PAT images corresponding to left-side and right-side whisker stimulation, respectively. (d) is the open-skull photograph of the rat cortical surface (B, bregma ; L, lambda; M, midline; A, activated regions corresponding to whisker stimulation).  Fig. 6 shows functional changes of sO 2 and HbT in the rat cerebral cortex as a result of the physiological modulations. Under the hyperoxia status, the averaged sO 2 level, 2  >, in the areas of the imaged cortical venous vessels in the rat brain, is higher than that under the normoxia status, and the difference 2> is ~10%; while under the hypoxia status, the 2 > is lower than that under the normoxia status, and the difference 2> is ~13%. While the averaged HbT value, , presents a relative increase of ~12%, denoted by / , as a result of the change from normoxia to hypoxia, which was comparatively larger than the ~4% relative increase in as a result of the change from hyperoxia to normoxia.  Breast cancer diagnosis 17  (Figure)  Fig. 7. Thermoacoustic image of a mastectomy specimen. 18   By utilizing low scattered microwave for excitation, TAT is capable of penetrating thick (several cm) biological tissues with less than mm spatial resolution. Since cancerous tissue and normal tissue have very different responses to radio frequency radiation, TAT has great potential in early breast cancer diagnosis. Fig. 7 shows the TAT image of a mastectomy specimen, where malignant breast tissue generates a much stronger thermoacoustic signal than the surrounding benign tissue due to its high microwave absorption.  Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM)  Fig. 8 shows a representative PAM set-up. 19 A tunable dye laser is pumped by a Q-switched pulsed Nd:YAG (neodymium: yttrium aluminum garnet) laser. A short laser pulse at a certain wavelength between 532-770 nm is generated to irradiate the target tissue to induce acoustic pressure waves. Laser pulses of ~6 mJ/cm 2 at the focus will be delivered at 10 Hz repetition rate. An optical fiber of 0.6 mm core diameter is coaxially positioned on a three-dimensional mechanical stage with changeable ultrasonic transducers between 25-75 MHz.  (Figure)  Fig. 8. Experimental set-up of dark field reflection mode PAM system. 20   (Figure)  Fig. 9. Multi-wavelength PAM imaging for blood oxygenation mapping of rat skin. 21   (Figure)  Fig. 10. Multi-wavelength PAM imaging for in vivo melanoma detection. 22   The imaging depth of PAM is mainly limited by the ultrasonic attenuation. The spatial (i.e. axial and lateral) resolutions depend on the ultrasonic transducer used. An ultrasonic transducer with high central frequency and broader bandwidth are chosen to obtain high axial resolution. The lateral resolution is determined by the focal diameter of the transducer. For instance, a 50 MHz ultrasonic transducer provides 15 micrometre axial and 45 micrometre lateral resolution with ~3 mm imaging depth.  PAM has multiple important applications in functional imaging. Two examples are shown in Figs. 9 and 10. PAM can detect changes in oxygenated/deoxygenated hemoglobin in small vessels. As shown in Fig. 9, arterioles (red) and venules (blue) are clearly delineated with high spatial resolution. 23 Fig. 10 shows the capability of PAM to image skin melanoma by using dual wavelength to obtain the morphological relationship between the melanoma and its surrounding blood vessels structures in vivo . 24  See also   Photoacoustic tomography  Multispectral optoacoustic tomography  1 L.
