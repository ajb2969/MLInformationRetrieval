   Coenzyme F420-0:L-glutamate ligase      Coenzyme F420-0:L-glutamate ligase   Coenzyme F420-0:L-glutamate ligase (, CofE-AF , MJ0768 , CofE ) is an enzyme with system name L-glutamate:coenzyme F420-0 ligase (GDP-forming) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   GTP + coenzyme F420-0 + L- glutamate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GDP + phosphate + coenzyme F420-1   This protein catalyses the successive addition of two glutamate residues to cofactor F420 by two distinct and independent reactions.
