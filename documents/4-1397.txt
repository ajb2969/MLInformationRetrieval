Symbolic Cholesky decomposition

In the mathematical subfield of numerical analysis the symbolic Cholesky decomposition is an algorithm used to determine the non-zero pattern for the 
 
 
 
  factors of a symmetric sparse matrix when applying the Cholesky decomposition or variants.
Algorithm
Let 
 
 
 
  be a sparse symmetric positive definite matrix with elements from a field 

, which we wish to factorize as 
 
 
 
 .
In order to implement an efficient sparse factorization it has been found to be necessary to determine the non zero structure of the factors before doing any numerical work. To write the algorithm down we use the following notation:

Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be sets representing the non-zero patterns of columns i and j (below the diagonal only, and including diagonal elements) of matrices 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively.
Take 
 
 
 
  to mean the smallest element of 
 
 
 
 .
Use a parent function 
 
 
 
  to define the elimination tree within the matrix.

The following algorithm gives an efficient symbolic factorization of
