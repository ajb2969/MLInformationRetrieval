Marangoni number

The Marangoni number (Ma) is a dimensionless number named after Italian scientist Carlo Marangoni. The Marangoni number may be regarded as proportional to (thermal-) surface tension forces divided by viscous forces. It is – for example – applicable to bubble and foam research or calculations of cryogenic spacecraft propellant behaviour.




γ: surface tension, (SI units: N/m);
L: characteristic length, (SI units: m);


 
 : thermal diffusivity, (SI units: m2/s);
η: dynamic viscosity, (SI units: kg/(s·m));
∆T: temperature difference, (SI units: K).
