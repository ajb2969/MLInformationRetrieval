Semivariance


''For the measure of downside risk, see Variance#Semivariance


In spatial statistics, the empirical semivariance is described by



where z is a datum at a particular location, h is the distance between ordered data, and n(h) is the number of paired data at a distance of h. The semivariance is half the variance of the increments 
 
 
 
 , but the whole variance of z-values at given separation distance h (Bachmaier and Backes, 2008).
A plot of semivariances versus distances between ordered data in a graph is known as a semivariogram rather than a variogram. Many authors call 
 
 
 
  a variogram, others use the terms variogram and semivariogram synonymously. However, Bachmaier and Backes (2008), who discussed this confusion, have shown that 
 
 
 
  should be called a variogram, terms like semivariogram or semivariance should be avoided.
