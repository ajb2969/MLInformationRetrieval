 _{i}))^{2}     where z is a datum at a particular location, h is the distance between ordered data, and n ( h ) is the number of paired data at a distance of h . The semivariance is half the variance of the increments     z   (    x  i   +  h   )    -   z   (   x  i   )          z     subscript  x  i   h      z   subscript  x  i      z(x_{i}+h)-z(x_{i})   , but the whole variance of z-values at given separation distance h (Bachmaier and Backes, 2008).  A plot of semivariances versus distances between ordered data in a graph is known as a semivariogram rather than a variogram . Many authors call    2   γ  ^    (  h  )       2   normal-^  γ   h    2\hat{\gamma}(h)   a variogram, others use the terms variogram and semivariogram synonymously. However, Bachmaier and Backes (2008), who discussed this confusion, have shown that     γ  ^    (  h  )        normal-^  γ   h    \hat{\gamma}(h)   should be called a variogram, terms like semivariogram or semivariance should be avoided.
