   Serine—pyruvate transaminase      Serine—pyruvate transaminase   In enzymology , a serine-pyruvate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-serine + pyruvate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-hydroxypyruvate + L-alanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-serine and pyruvate , whereas its two products are 3-hydroxypyruvate and L-alanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-serine:pyruvate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include SPT , and hydroxypyruvate:L-alanine transaminase . This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
