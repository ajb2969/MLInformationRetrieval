   Craig retroazimuthal projection      Craig retroazimuthal projection   The Craig retroazimuthal  map projection was created by James Ireland Craig in 1909. It is a cylindrical projection preserving the direction from any place to one other, predetermined place while avoiding some of the bizarre distortion of the Hammer retroazimuthal projection . It is sometimes known as the Mecca projection because Craig, who had worked in Egypt as a cartographer , created it to help Muslims find their qibla . 1 The projection is defined by:      x  =   λ       x  λ    x=\lambda\,         y  =    λ   sin   (  λ  )      (     sin   (  ϕ  )     cos   (  λ  )     -    tan   (   ϕ  0   )     cos   (  ϕ  )      )        y      λ    λ          ϕ     λ         subscript  ϕ  0      ϕ        y=\frac{\lambda}{\sin(\lambda)}(\sin(\phi)\cos(\lambda)-\tan(\phi_{0})\cos(%
 \phi))\,     given latitude   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   , longitude relative to the fixed location   λ   λ   \lambda   , and latitude of the fixed location    ϕ  0     subscript  ϕ  0    \phi_{0}   .  The above equation has a discontinuity at    λ  =  0      λ  0    \lambda=0   ; to resolve this, at 0° longitude, take     λ  /   sin   (  λ  )     =  1        λ    λ    1    \lambda/\sin(\lambda)=1   , the ratio's continuous completion. 2  See also   List of map projections   References  External links   An interactive Java Applet to study the metric deformations of the Craig Projection .
