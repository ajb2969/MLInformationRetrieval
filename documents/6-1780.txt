Fenchel's theorem

(Figure)
A circle of radius r has average curvature 1/r=2π/P, where P=2πr is the perimeter.

In differential geometry, Fenchel's theorem (Werner Fenchel, 1929) states that the average curvature of any closed convex plane curve is



where P is the perimeter. More generally, for an arbitrary closed curve in space the average curvature is 
 
 
 
  with equality holding only for convex plane curves.
