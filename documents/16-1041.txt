   Descendant tree (group theory)      Descendant tree (group theory)   In mathematics, specifically group theory , a descendant tree is a hierarchical structure for visualizing parent-descendant relations between isomorphism classes of finite groups of prime power order    p  n     superscript  p  n    p^{n}   , for a fixed prime number   p   p   p   and varying integer exponents    n  ‚â•  0      n  0    n\geq 0   . Such groups are briefly called finite  p-groups . The vertices of a descendant tree are isomorphism classes of finite p -groups.  Additionally to their order     p  n     superscript  p  n    p^{n}   , finite p -groups have two further related invariants, the nilpotency class    c   c   c   and the coclass     r  =   n  -  c       r    n  c     r=n-c   . It turned out that descendant trees of a particular kind, the so-called pruned coclass trees whose infinitely many vertices share a common coclass   r   r   r   , reveal a repeating finite pattern. These two crucial properties of finiteness and periodicity admit a characterization of all members of the tree by finitely many parametrized presentations . Consequently, descendant trees play a fundamental role in the classification of finite p -groups. By means of kernels and targets of Artin transfer homomorphisms , descendant trees can be endowed with additional structure.  Definitions and terminology  According to M. F. Newman , 1 there exist several distinct definitions of the parent     œÄ   (  G  )       œÄ  G    \pi(G)   of a finite p -group   G   G   G   . The common principle is to form the quotient      œÄ   (  G  )    =   G  /  N         œÄ  G     G  N     \pi(G)=G/N   of   G   G   G   by a suitable normal subgroup     N  ‚óÅ  G     normal-‚óÅ  N  G    N\triangleleft G   which can be  :# either the centre     N  =    Œ∂  1    (  G  )        N     subscript  Œ∂  1   G     N=\zeta_{1}(G)   of   G   G   G   , whence     œÄ   (  G  )    =    G  /   Œ∂  1     (  G  )          œÄ  G       G   subscript  Œ∂  1    G     \pi(G)=G/\zeta_{1}(G)   is called the central quotient of   G   G   G     :# or the last non-trivial term    N  =    Œ≥  c    (  G  )        N     subscript  Œ≥  c   G     N=\gamma_{c}(G)   of the lower central series of   G   G   G   , where   c   c   c   denotes the nilpotency class of   G   G   G     :# or the last non-trivial term    N  =    P   c  -  1     (  G  )        N     subscript  P    c  1    G     N=P_{c-1}(G)   of the lower exponent-p central series of   G   G   G   , where   c   c   c   denotes the exponent- p class of   G   G   G     :# or the last non-trivial term    N  =   G   (   d  -  1   )        N   superscript  G    d  1      N=G^{(d-1)}   of the derived series of   G   G   G   , where   d   d   d   denotes the derived length of   G   G   G   .  In each case,   G   G   G   is called an immediate descendant of    œÄ   (  G  )       œÄ  G    \pi(G)   and a directed edge of the tree is defined either by    G  ‚Üí   œÄ   (  G  )       normal-‚Üí  G    œÄ  G     G\to\pi(G)   in the direction of the canonical projection     œÄ  :   G  ‚Üí   œÄ   (  G  )        normal-:  œÄ   normal-‚Üí  G    œÄ  G      \pi:G\to\pi(G)   onto the quotient     œÄ   (  G  )    =   G  /  N         œÄ  G     G  N     \pi(G)=G/N   or by     œÄ   (  G  )    ‚Üí  G     normal-‚Üí    œÄ  G   G    \pi(G)\to G   in the opposite direction, which is more usual for descendant trees. The former convention is adopted by C. R. Leedham-Green and M. F. Newman , 2 by M. du Sautoy and D. Segal , 3 by C. R. Leedham-Green and S. McKay , 4 and by B. Eick, C. R. Leedham-Green, M. F. Newman and E. A. O'Brien . 5 The latter definition is used by M. F. Newman , 6 by M. F. Newman and E. A. O'Brien , 7 by M. du Sautoy , 8 and by B. Eick and C. R. Leedham-Green . 9  In the following, the direction of the canonical projections is selected for all edges. Then, more generally, a vertex   R   R   R   is a descendant of a vertex   P   P   P   , and   P   P   P   is an ancestor of   R   R   R   , if either   R   R   R   is equal to   P   P   P   or there is a path     R  =   Q  0   ‚Üí   Q  1   ‚Üí  ‚ãØ  ‚Üí   Q   m  -  1    ‚Üí   Q  m   =  P        R   subscript  Q  0     normal-‚Üí     subscript  Q  1     normal-‚Üí    normal-‚ãØ    normal-‚Üí     subscript  Q    m  1      normal-‚Üí     subscript  Q  m        P     R=Q_{0}\to Q_{1}\to\cdots\to Q_{m-1}\to Q_{m}=P   , with    m  ‚â•  1      m  1    m\geq 1   , of directed edges from   R   R   R   to   P   P   P   . The vertices forming the path necessarily coincide with the iterated parents      Q  j   =    œÄ  j    (  R  )         subscript  Q  j      superscript  œÄ  j   R     Q_{j}=\pi^{j}(R)   of   R   R   R   , with    0  ‚â§  j  ‚â§  m        0  j       m     0\leq j\leq m   . In the most important special case (2.) of parents defined as last non-trivial lower central quotients, they can also be viewed as the successive quotients      R  /   Œ≥    c  +  1   -  j      (  R  )         R   subscript  Œ≥      c  1   j     R    R/\gamma_{c+1-j}(R)    of class     c  -  j      c  j    c-j   of   R   R   R   when the nilpotency class of   R   R   R   is given by    c  ‚â•  m      c  m    c\geq m   .  Generally, the descendant tree     ùíØ   (  G  )       ùíØ  G    \mathcal{T}(G)   of a vertex   G   G   G   is the subtree of all descendants of   G   G   G   , starting at the root    G   G   G   . The maximal possible descendant tree    ùíØ   (  1  )       ùíØ  1    \mathcal{T}(1)   of the trivial group   1   1   1   contains all finite p -groups and is somewhat exceptional, since, for any parent definition (1.‚Äì4.), the trivial group   1   1   1   has infinitely many abelian p -groups as its immediate descendants. The parent definitions (2.‚Äì3.) have the advantage that any non-trivial finite p -group (of order divisible by   p   p   p   ) possesses only finitely many immediate descendants.  Pro- p groups and coclass trees  For a sound understanding of coclass trees as a particular instance of descendant trees, it is necessary to summarize some facts concerning infinite topological  pro- p groups . The members     Œ≥  j    (  S  )        subscript  Œ≥  j   S    \gamma_{j}(S)   , with    j  ‚â•  1      j  1    j\geq 1   , of the lower central series of a pro- p group   S   S   S   are closed subgroups of finite index, and therefore the corresponding quotients     S  /   Œ≥  j     (  S  )         S   subscript  Œ≥  j    S    S/\gamma_{j}(S)   are finite p -groups. The pro- p group   S   S   S   is said to be of coclass      cc   (  S  )    =  r        cc  S   r    \mathrm{cc}(S)=r   when the limit    r  =     lim   j  ‚Üí  ‚àû      cc   (    S  /   Œ≥  j     (  S  )    )         r    subscript    normal-‚Üí  j       cc      S   subscript  Œ≥  j    S       r=\lim_{j\to\infty}\,\mathrm{cc}(S/\gamma_{j}(S))   of the coclass of the successive quotients exists and is finite. An infinite pro- p group   S   S   S   of coclass   r   r   r   is a p -adic pre- space group , 10 since it has a normal subgroup   T   T   T   , the translation group , which is a free module over the ring    ‚Ñ§  p     subscript  ‚Ñ§  p    \mathbb{Z}_{p}   of p -adic integers of uniquely determined rank   d   d   d   , the dimension , such that the quotient    P  =   S  /  T       P    S  T     P=S/T   is a finite p -group, the point group , which acts on   T   T   T    uniserially . The dimension is given by    d  =    (   p  -  1   )    p  s        d      p  1    superscript  p  s      d=(p-1)p^{s}   , with some   r   r   r   is provided by the so-called Theorem D , which is one of the five Coclass Theorems proved in 1994 independently by A. Shalev 11 and by C. R. Leedham-Green , 12 and conjectured in 1980 already by C. R. Leedham-Green and M. F. Newman. 13 Theorem D asserts that there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of infinite pro- p groups of coclass   p   p   p   , for any fixed prime   r   r   r   and any fixed non-negative integer   S   S   S   . As a consequence, if   r   r   r   is an infinite pro- p group of coclass    i  ‚â•  1      i  1    i\geq 1   , then there exists a minimal integer    j  ‚â•  i      j  i    j\geq i   such that the following three conditions are satisfied for any integer     cc   (    S  /   Œ≥  j     (  S  )    )    =  r        cc      S   subscript  Œ≥  j    S    r    \mathrm{cc}(S/\gamma_{j}(S))=r   .  :*     S  /   Œ≥  j     (  S  )         S   subscript  Œ≥  j    S    S/\gamma_{j}(S)   ,  :*   r   r   r   is not a lower central quotient of any infinite pro- p group of coclass   S   S   S   which is not isomorphic to      Œ≥  j   /   Œ≥   j  +  1      (  S  )          subscript  Œ≥  j    subscript  Œ≥    j  1     S    \gamma_{j}/\gamma_{j+1}(S)   ,  :*   p   p   p   is cyclic of order    ùíØ   (  R  )       ùíØ  R    \mathcal{T}(R)   . The descendant tree    R  =    S  /   Œ≥  i     (  S  )        R      S   subscript  Œ≥  i    S     R=S/\gamma_{i}(S)   , with respect to the parent definition (2.), of the root   i   i   i   with minimal    ùíØ   (  S  )       ùíØ  S    \mathcal{T}(S)   is called the coclass tree    S   S   S   of    R  =    S  /   Œ≥  i     (  S  )    ‚Üê    S  /   Œ≥   i  +  1      (  S  )    ‚Üê  ‚ãØ        R      S   subscript  Œ≥  i    S     normal-‚Üê        S   subscript  Œ≥    i  1     S     normal-‚Üê    normal-‚ãØ     R=S/\gamma_{i}(S)\leftarrow S/\gamma_{i+1}(S)\leftarrow\cdots   and its unique maximal infinite (reverse-directed) path    ùíØ   (  R  )       ùíØ  R    \mathcal{T}(R)   is called the mainline (or trunk ) of the tree.  (Figure)  Figure 1: A descendant tree. The branches B(2),B(4) have depth 0, and B(5),B(7), resp. B(6),B(8), are isomorphic as trees.   Tree diagram  Further terminology, used in diagrams visualizing descendant trees, is explained in Figure 1 by means of an artificial abstract tree. On the left hand side, a level indicates the basic top-down design of a descendant tree. For concrete trees, such as those in Figure 2,3 etc., the level is usually replaced by a scale of orders increasing from the top to the bottom. A vertex is capable (or extendable ) if it has at least one immediate descendant, otherwise it is terminal (or a leaf ). Vertices sharing a common parent are called siblings .  If the descendant tree is a coclass tree    R  =   R  0       R   subscript  R  0     R=R_{0}   with root     (   R  n   )    n  ‚â•  0      subscript   subscript  R  n     n  0     (R_{n})_{n\geq 0}   and with mainline vertices   n   n   n   labelled according to the level     ‚Ñ¨   (  n  )    =    ùíØ   (   R  n   )    ‚àñ   ùíØ   (   R   n  +  1    )           ‚Ñ¨  n       ùíØ   subscript  R  n      ùíØ   subscript  R    n  1        \mathcal{B}(n)=\mathcal{T}(R_{n})\setminus\mathcal{T}(R_{n+1})   , then the finite subtree defined as the difference set    ‚Ñ¨   (   R  n   )       ‚Ñ¨   subscript  R  n     \mathcal{B}(R_{n})   is called the n th branch (or twig ) of the tree or also the branch     R  n     subscript  R  n    R_{n}    with root     n  ‚â•  0      n  0    n\geq 0   , for any    k  ‚â•  0      k  0    k\geq 0   . The depth of a branch is the maximal length of the paths connecting its vertices with its root. If all vertices of depth bigger than a given integer    ‚Ñ¨   (  n  )       ‚Ñ¨  n    \mathcal{B}(n)   are removed from branch     ‚Ñ¨  k    (  n  )        subscript  ‚Ñ¨  k   n    \mathcal{B}_{k}(n)   , then we obtain the (depth-) pruned branch      ùíØ  k    (  R  )        subscript  ùíØ  k   R    \mathcal{T}_{k}(R)   . Correspondingly, the pruned coclass tree     ùíØ   (  R  )       ùíØ  R    \mathcal{T}(R)   , resp. the entire coclass tree     (    ‚Ñ¨  k    (  n  )    )    n  ‚â•  0      subscript     subscript  ‚Ñ¨  k   n     n  0     (\mathcal{B}_{k}(n))_{n\geq 0}   , consists of the infinite sequence of its pruned branches     (   ‚Ñ¨   (  n  )    )    n  ‚â•  0      subscript    ‚Ñ¨  n     n  0     (\mathcal{B}(n))_{n\geq 0}   , resp. branches    R  n     subscript  R  n    R_{n}   , connected by the mainline, whose vertices   S   S   S   are called infinitely capable .  Virtual periodicity  The periodicity of branches of depth-pruned coclass trees has been proved with analytic methods using zeta functions 14 of groups by M. du Sautoy , 15 and with algebraic techniques using cohomology groups by B. Eick and C. R. Leedham-Green . 16 The former methods admit the qualitative insight of ultimate virtual periodicity , the latter techniques determine the quantitative structure:  For any infinite pro- p group    r  ‚â•  1      r  1    r\geq 1   of coclass   d   d   d   and dimension    k  ‚â•  1      k  1    k\geq 1   , and for any given depth     f   (  k  )    ‚â•  1        f  k   1    f(k)\geq 1   , there exists an effective minimal lower bound   d   d   d   , where periodicity of length     ùíØ   (  S  )       ùíØ  S    \mathcal{T}(S)   of pruned branches of the coclass tree      ‚Ñ¨  k    (   n  +  d   )    ‚âÉ    ‚Ñ¨  k    (  n  )       similar-to-or-equals     subscript  ‚Ñ¨  k     n  d       subscript  ‚Ñ¨  k   n     \mathcal{B}_{k}(n+d)\simeq\mathcal{B}_{k}(n)   sets in, that is, there exist graph isomorphisms    n  ‚â•   f   (  k  )        n    f  k     n\geq f(k)   for all    P  =   R   f   (  k  )         P   subscript  R    f  k      P=R_{f(k)}   .  These central results can be expressed ostensively: When we look at a coclass tree through a pair of blinkers and ignore a finite number of pre-periodic branches at the top, then we shall see a repeating finite pattern ( ultimate periodicity). However, if we take wider blinkers the pre-periodic initial section may become longer ( virtual periodicity).  The vertex   k   k   k   is called the periodic root of the pruned coclass tree, for a fixed value of the depth   G   G   G   .  Multifurcation and coclass graphs  Assume that parents of finite p -groups are defined as last non-trivial lower central quotients (2.). For a p -group     cc   (  G  )    =  r        cc  G   r    \mathrm{cc}(G)=r   of coclass    ùíØ   (  G  )       ùíØ  G    \mathcal{T}(G)   , we can distinguish its (entire) descendant tree   r   r   r   and its coclass -     ùíØ  r    (  G  )        superscript  ùíØ  r   G    \mathcal{T}^{r}(G)    descendent tree    r   r   r   , the subtree consisting of descendants of coclass   G   G   G   only. The group     ùíØ   (  G  )    =    ùíØ  r    (  G  )          ùíØ  G      superscript  ùíØ  r   G     \mathcal{T}(G)=\mathcal{T}^{r}(G)   is coclass settled if    ŒΩ   (  G  )       ŒΩ  G    \nu(G)   .  The nuclear rank    G   G   G   of   G   G   G   in the theory of the p -group generation algorithm by M. F. Newman 17 and E. A. O'Brien 18 provides the following criteria.  :*     ŒΩ   (  G  )    =  0        ŒΩ  G   0    \nu(G)=0   is terminal (and thus trivially coclass settled) if and only if     ŒΩ   (  G  )    =  1        ŒΩ  G   1    \nu(G)=1   .  :*If   G   G   G   , then   G   G   G   is capable. (But it remains unknown whether     ŒΩ   (  G  )    =  m  ‚â•  2          ŒΩ  G   m       2     \nu(G)=m\geq 2   is coclass settled.)  :*If   G   G   G   , then   G   G   G   is capable but not coclass settled.  In the last case, a more precise assertion is possible: If   r   r   r   has coclass     ŒΩ   (  G  )    =  m  ‚â•  2          ŒΩ  G   m       2     \nu(G)=m\geq 2   and nuclear rank     ùíØ  r    (  G  )        superscript  ùíØ  r   G    \mathcal{T}^{r}(G)   , then it gives rise to an m -fold multifurcation into a regular coclass- r descendant tree     m  -  1      m  1    m-1   and     ùíØ   r  +  j     (  G  )        superscript  ùíØ    r  j    G    \mathcal{T}^{r+j}(G)    irregular descendant trees     r  +  j      r  j    r+j   of coclass    1  ‚â§  j  ‚â§   m  -  1         1  j         m  1      1\leq j\leq m-1   , for   G   G   G   . Consequently, the descendant tree of     ùíØ   (  G  )    =      ‚à™  Àô    j  =  0    m  -  1      ùíØ   r  +  j     (  G  )          ùíØ  G      superscript   subscript   normal-Àô      j  0      m  1     superscript  ùíØ    r  j    G     \mathcal{T}(G)=\dot{\cup}_{j=0}^{m-1}\,\mathcal{T}^{r+j}(G)   is the disjoint union    c  =   cl   (  Q  )    =    cl   (  P  )    +  1         c    cl  Q            cl  P   1      c=\mathrm{cl}(Q)=\mathrm{cl}(P)+1   .  Multifurcation is correlated with different orders of the last non-trivial lower central of immediate descendants. Since the nilpotency class increases exactly by a unit,    P  =   œÄ   (  Q  )        P    œÄ  Q     P=\pi(Q)   , from a parent   Q   Q   Q   to any immediate descendant    r  =   cc   (  Q  )    =   cc   (  P  )          r    cc  Q          cc  P      r=\mathrm{cc}(Q)=\mathrm{cc}(P)   , the coclass remains stable,     |    Œ≥  c    (  Q  )    |   =  p           subscript  Œ≥  c   Q    p    |\gamma_{c}(Q)|=p   , if   Q   Q   Q   . In this case,    P  ‚Üê  Q     normal-‚Üê  P  Q    P\leftarrow Q   is a regular immediate descendant with directed edge    m  -  1      m  1    m-1   of depth 1 (as usual).

If the condition of depth (or step size ) 1 is imposed on all directed edges, then the maximal descendant tree   1   1   1   of the trivial group       ‚à™  Àô    r  =  0   ‚àû    ùí¢   (  p  ,  r  )        superscript   subscript   normal-Àô      r  0      ùí¢   p  r     \dot{\cup}_{r=0}^{\infty}\,\mathcal{G}(p,r)   splits into a countably infinite disjoint union    ùí¢   (  p  ,  r  )       ùí¢   p  r     \mathcal{G}(p,r)   of directed coclass graphs      ùí¢   (  p  ,  r  )    =    (      ‚à™  Àô   i    ùíØ   (   S  i   )    )    ‚à™  Àô    ùí¢  0    (  p  ,  r  )          ùí¢   p  r         subscript   normal-Àô    i   ùíØ   subscript  S  i     normal-Àô     subscript  ùí¢  0    p  r      \mathcal{G}(p,r)=\left(\dot{\cup}_{i}\,\mathcal{T}(S_{i})\right)\dot{\cup}%
 \mathcal{G}_{0}(p,r)   , which are rather forests than trees. More precisely, the above mentioned Coclass Theorems imply that    ùíØ   (   S  i   )       ùíØ   subscript  S  i     \mathcal{T}(S_{i})   is the disjoint union of finitely many coclass trees    S  i     subscript  S  i    S_{i}   of (pairwise non-isomorphic) infinite pro- p groups   r   r   r   of coclass     ùí¢  0    (  p  ,  r  )        subscript  ùí¢  0    p  r     \mathcal{G}_{0}(p,r)   (Theorem D) and a finite subgraph    ‚ü®  order  ,  counting number  ‚ü©     order  counting number    \langle\text{order},\text{counting number}\rangle   of sporadic groups lying outside of any coclass tree.  Identifiers  The SmallGroups Library identifiers of finite groups, in particular p -groups, given in the form    ‚ü®  counting number  ‚ü©     delimited-‚ü®‚ü©  counting number    \langle\text{counting number}\rangle   in the following concrete examples of descendant trees, are due to H. U. Besche, B. Eick and E. A. O'Brien . 19  20 When the group orders are given in a scale on the left hand side as in Figure 2 and Figure 3, the identifiers are briefly denoted by   p   p   p   .  Depending on the prime    512  =   2  9       512   superscript  2  9     512=2^{9}   , there is an upper bound on the order of groups for which a SmallGroup identifier exists, e. g.    p  =  2      p  2    p=2   for    2187  =   3  7       2187   superscript  3  7     2187=3^{7}   , and    p  =  3      p  3    p=3   for   1   1   1   . For groups of bigger orders, a notation resembling the descendant structure is employed: A regular immediate descendant, connected by an edge of depth   P   P   P   with its parent     P  -   #  1    ;  counting number       P    normal-#  1    counting number    P-\#1;\text{counting number}   , is denoted by    d  ‚â•  2      d  2    d\geq 2   , and an irregular immediate descendant, connected by an edge of depth   P   P   P   with its parent     P  -   #  d    ;  counting number       P    normal-#  d    counting number    P-\#d;\text{counting number}   , is denoted by     ùí¢   (  p  ,  0  )    =    ùí¢  0    (  p  ,  0  )          ùí¢   p  0       subscript  ùí¢  0    p  0      \mathcal{G}(p,0)=\mathcal{G}_{0}(p,0)   .  Concrete examples  In all examples, the underlying parent definition (2.) corresponds to the usual lower central series. Occasional differences to the parent definition (3.) with respect to the lower exponent- p central series are pointed out.  Coclass 0  The coclass graph   0   0    of finite p -groups of coclass   1   1   1   does not contain a coclass tree and consists of the trivial group     C  p     subscript  C  p    C_{p}   and the cyclic group    p   p   p   of order    p  =  2      p  2    p=2   , which is a leaf (however, it is capable with respect to the lower exponent- p central series). For    C  p     subscript  C  p    C_{p}   the SmallGroup identifier of    ‚ü®  2  ,  1  ‚ü©     2  1    \langle 2,1\rangle   is    p  =  3      p  3    p=3   , for    ‚ü®  3  ,  1  ‚ü©     3  1    \langle 3,1\rangle   it is     ùí¢   (  p  ,  1  )    =    ùíØ  1    (  R  )    ‚à™  Àô    ùí¢  0    (  p  ,  1  )          ùí¢   p  1       superscript  ùíØ  1   R   normal-Àô     subscript  ùí¢  0    p  1      \mathcal{G}(p,1)=\mathcal{T}^{1}(R)\dot{\cup}\mathcal{G}_{0}(p,1)   .

Figure 3, where all groups of order at least   2   2   2   are metabelian , that is non-abelian with derived length   p   p   p   (vertices represented by black discs in contrast to contour squares indicating abelian groups). In Figure 3, smaller black discs denote metabelian 3-groups where even the maximal subgroups are non-abelian, a feature which does not occur for the metabelian 2-groups in Figure 2, since they all possess an abelian subgroup of index    ùí¢   (  2  ,  1  )       ùí¢   2  1     \mathcal{G}(2,1)   (usually exactly one). The coclass tree of    ùí¢   (  3  ,  1  )       ùí¢   3  1     \mathcal{G}(3,1)   , resp.    ‚ü®  8  ,  3  ‚ü©     8  3    \langle 8,3\rangle   , has periodic root   1   1   1   and period of length    ‚Ñ¨   (  3  )       ‚Ñ¨  3    \mathcal{B}(3)   starting with branch    ‚ü®  81  ,  9  ‚ü©     81  9    \langle 81,9\rangle   , resp. periodic root   2   2   2   and period of length    ‚Ñ¨   (  4  )       ‚Ñ¨  4    \mathcal{B}(4)   starting with branch   1   1   1   . Both trees have branches of bounded depth    ùí¢   (  p  ,  1  )       ùí¢   p  1     \mathcal{G}(p,1)   , so their virtual periodicity is in fact a strict periodicity .  However, the coclass tree of    p  ‚â•  5      p  5    p\geq 5   with    ùí¢   (  p  ,  1  )       ùí¢   p  1     \mathcal{G}(p,1)   has unbounded depth and contains non-metabelian groups, and the coclass tree of    p  ‚â•  7      p  7    p\geq 7   with    ùí¢   (  2  ,  1  )       ùí¢   2  1     \mathcal{G}(2,1)   has even unbounded width , that is the number of descendants of a fixed order increases indefinitely with growing order . 21  With the aid of kernels and targets of Artin transfers, the diagrams in Figure 2,3 can be endowed with additional information and redrawn as structured descendant trees .  The concrete examples    ùí¢   (  3  ,  1  )       ùí¢   3  1     \mathcal{G}(3,1)   and   G   G   G   provide an opportunity to give a parametrized power-commutator presentation  22 (here a polycyclic presentation) for the complete coclass tree, mentioned in the lead section as a benefit of the descendant tree concept and as a consequence of the periodicity of the pruned coclass tree. In both cases, the group    x  ,  y     x  y    x,y   is generated by two elements    s  j     subscript  s  j    s_{j}   but the presentation contains the series of higher commutators     2  ‚â§  j  ‚â§   n  -  1   =   cl   (  G  )          2  j         n  1          cl  G      2\leq j\leq n-1=\mathrm{cl}(G)   ,     s  2   =   [  y  ,  x  ]        subscript  s  2    y  x     s_{2}=[y,x]   , starting with the main commutator      s  n   =  1       subscript  s  n   1    s_{n}=1   . The nilpotency is formally expressed by     |  G  |   =   p  n         G    superscript  p  n     |G|=p^{n}   , when the group is of order    p  =  2      p  2    p=2   .

For the prime    ‚ü®  8  ,  3  ‚ü©     8  3    \langle 8,3\rangle   , such groups do not exist at all, since the group    p  ‚â•  3      p  3    p\geq 3   is coclass settled, which is the deeper reason for Taussky's Theorem. This remarkable fact has been observed by G. Bagnera 24 in 1898 already.  For odd primes   2   2   2   , the existence of p -groups of coclass    (  p  ,  p  )     p  p    (p,p)   with abelianization of type     G  0  3    (  0  ,  0  )        subscript   superscript  G  3   0    0  0     G^{3}_{0}(0,0)   is due to the fact that the group   2   2   2   is not coclass settled. Its nuclear rank equals    ùíØ   (    G  0  3    (  0  ,  0  )    )       ùíØ     subscript   superscript  G  3   0    0  0      \mathcal{T}(G^{3}_{0}(0,0))   , which gives rise to a bifurcation of the descendant tree     ùíØ  1    (    G  0  3    (  0  ,  0  )    )        superscript  ùíØ  1      subscript   superscript  G  3   0    0  0      \mathcal{T}^{1}(G^{3}_{0}(0,0))   into two coclass graphs. The regular component     ùíØ  1    (    C  p   √ó   C  p    )        superscript  ùíØ  1      subscript  C  p    subscript  C  p      \mathcal{T}^{1}(C_{p}\times C_{p})   is a subtree of the unique tree    ùí¢   (  p  ,  1  )       ùí¢   p  1     \mathcal{G}(p,1)   in the coclass graph     ùíØ  2    (    G  0  3    (  0  ,  0  )    )        superscript  ùíØ  2      subscript   superscript  G  3   0    0  0      \mathcal{T}^{2}(G^{3}_{0}(0,0))   . The irregular component    ùí¢  =    ùí¢   (  p  ,  p  )     (  p  ,  2  )        ùí¢     subscript  ùí¢   p  p     p  2      \mathcal{G}=\mathcal{G}_{(p,p)}(p,2)   becomes a subgraph    ùí¢   (  p  ,  2  )       ùí¢   p  2     \mathcal{G}(p,2)   of the coclass graph   2   2   2   when the connecting edges of depth     G  0  3    (  0  ,  0  )        subscript   superscript  G  3   0    0  0     G^{3}_{0}(0,0)   of the irregular immediate descendants of    p  =  3      p  3    p=3   are removed.  For   ùí¢   ùí¢   \mathcal{G}   , this subgraph    243  =   3  5       243   superscript  3  5     243=3^{5}   is drawn in Figure 4. It has seven top level vertices of three important kinds, all having order    ‚ü®  243  ,  5  ‚ü©     243  5    \langle 243,5\rangle   , which have been discovered by G. Bagnera . 25  :*Firstly, there are two terminal Schur œÉ-groups     ‚ü®  243  ,  7  ‚ü©     243  7    \langle 243,7\rangle   and     ùí¢  0    (  3  ,  2  )        subscript  ùí¢  0    3  2     \mathcal{G}_{0}(3,2)   in the sporadic part    ùí¢   (  3  ,  2  )       ùí¢   3  2     \mathcal{G}(3,2)   of the coclass graph    G  =   ‚ü®  243  ,  4  ‚ü©       G   243  4     G=\langle 243,4\rangle   .  :*Secondly, the two groups    G  =   ‚ü®  243  ,  9  ‚ü©       G   243  9     G=\langle 243,9\rangle   and     ùíØ  2    (  G  )        superscript  ùíØ  2   G    \mathcal{T}^{2}(G)   are roots of finite trees     ùí¢  0    (  3  ,  2  )        subscript  ùí¢  0    3  2     \mathcal{G}_{0}(3,2)   in the sporadic part    ùíØ   (  G  )       ùíØ  G    \mathcal{T}(G)   (however, since they are not coclass settled, the complete trees    ‚ü®  243  ,  3  ‚ü©     243  3    \langle 243,3\rangle   are infinite) .  :*And, finally, the three groups    ‚ü®  243  ,  6  ‚ü©     243  6    \langle 243,6\rangle   ,    ‚ü®  243  ,  8  ‚ü©     243  8    \langle 243,8\rangle   and     ùíØ  2    (   ‚ü®  729  ,  40  ‚ü©   )        superscript  ùíØ  2    729  40     \mathcal{T}^{2}(\langle 729,40\rangle)   give rise to (infinite) coclass trees, e. g.,     ùíØ  2    (   ‚ü®  243  ,  6  ‚ü©   )        superscript  ùíØ  2    243  6     \mathcal{T}^{2}(\langle 243,6\rangle)   ,     ùíØ  2    (   ‚ü®  243  ,  8  ‚ü©   )        superscript  ùíØ  2    243  8     \mathcal{T}^{2}(\langle 243,8\rangle)   ,    ùí¢   (  3  ,  2  )       ùí¢   3  2     \mathcal{G}(3,2)   , each having a metabelian mainline, in the coclass graph   G   G   G   (again, none of these three groups is coclass settled). Displaying additional information on kernels and targets of Artin transfers, we can draw these trees as structured descendant trees .  Generally, a Schur group (called a closed group by I. Schur, who coined the concept) is a pro- p group     r   (  G  )    =    dim   ùîΩ  p     (    H  2    (  G  ,   ùîΩ  p   )    )          r  G      subscript  dim   subscript  ùîΩ  p       superscript  normal-H  2    G   subscript  ùîΩ  p        r(G)=\mathrm{dim}_{\mathbb{F}_{p}}(\mathrm{H}^{2}(G,\mathbb{F}_{p}))   whose relation rank     d   (  G  )    =    dim   ùîΩ  p     (    H  1    (  G  ,   ùîΩ  p   )    )          d  G      subscript  dim   subscript  ùîΩ  p       superscript  normal-H  1    G   subscript  ùîΩ  p        d(G)=\mathrm{dim}_{\mathbb{F}_{p}}(\mathrm{H}^{1}(G,\mathbb{F}_{p}))   coincides with its generator rank   G   G   G   . A œÉ-group is a pro- p group    œÉ  ‚àà   Aut   (  G  )        œÉ    Aut  G     \sigma\in\mathrm{Aut}(G)   which possesses an automorphism    x  ‚Ü¶   x   -  1       maps-to  x   superscript  x    1      x\mapsto x^{-1}   inducing the inversion    G  /   G  ‚Ä≤       G   superscript  G  normal-‚Ä≤     G/G^{\prime}   on its abelianization   G   G   G   . A Schur œÉ-group is a Schur group    G  /   G  ‚Ä≤       G   superscript  G  normal-‚Ä≤     G/G^{\prime}   which is also a œÉ-group and has a finite abelianization    ‚ü®  243  ,  3  ‚ü©     243  3    \langle 243,3\rangle   .  It should be pointed out that    ‚ü®  729  ,  40  ‚ü©     729  40    \langle 729,40\rangle   is not root of a coclass tree, since its immediate descendant    ‚ü®  729  ,  35  ‚ü©     729  35    \langle 729,35\rangle   , which is root of a coclass tree with metabelian mainline vertices, has two siblings    ‚ü®  729  ,  34  ‚ü©     729  34    \langle 729,34\rangle   , resp.   3   3   3   , which give rise to a single, resp. three, coclass tree(s) with non-metabelian mainline vertices having cyclic centres of order   5   5   5   and branches of considerable complexity but nevertheless of bounded depth    (  f  ,  g  ,  h  )     f  g  h    (f,g,h)   .

Benjamin, F. Lemmermeyer and C. Snyder 32 with respect to their occurrence as class-2 quotients   G   G   G   of bigger metabelian 2-groups    (  2  ,  2  ,  2  )     2  2  2    (2,2,2)   of type   3   3   3   and with coclass   2   2   2   , which are exactly the members of the descendant trees of the seven vertices. These authors use the classification of 2-groups by M. Hall and J. K. Senior 33 which is put in correspondence with the SmallGroups Library 34 in Table 2. The complexity of the descendant trees of these seven vertices increases with the 2-ranks and 4-ranks indicated in Table 2, where the maximal subgroups of index   G   G   G   in    H  i     subscript  H  i    H_{i}   are denoted by    1  ‚â§  i  ‚â§  7        1  i       7     1\leq i\leq 7   , for $1\le i\le 7$ .  History  Descendant trees with central quotients as parents (1.) are implicit in P. Hall's 1940 paper 35 about isoclinism of groups. Trees with last non-trivial lower central quotients as parents (2.) were first presented by C. R. Leedham-Green at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Vancouver, 1974 . 36 The first extensive tree diagrams have been drawn manually by J. A. Ascione, G. Havas and C. R. Leedham-Green (1977) , 37 by J. A. Ascione (1979) , 38 and by B. Nebelung (1989) . 39 In the former two cases, the parent definition by means of the lower exponent- p central series (3.) was adopted in view of computational advantages, in the latter case, where theoretical aspects were focussed, the parents were taken with respect to the usual lower central series (2.).  See also   The kernels and targets of Artin transfers have recently turned out to be compatible with parent-descendant relations between finite p -groups and can favourably be used to endow descendant trees with additional structure.
