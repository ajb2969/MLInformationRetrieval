Descendant tree (group theory)

In mathematics, specifically group theory, a descendant tree is a hierarchical structure for visualizing parent-descendant relations between isomorphism classes of finite groups of prime power order 
 
 
 
 , for a fixed prime number 
 
 
 
  and varying integer exponents 
 
 
 
 . Such groups are briefly called finite p-groups. The vertices of a descendant tree are isomorphism classes of finite p-groups.
Additionally to their order

 
 , finite p-groups have two further related invariants, the nilpotency class

 
  and the coclass

 
 . It turned out that descendant trees of a particular kind, the so-called pruned coclass trees whose infinitely many vertices share a common coclass 
 
 
 
 , reveal a repeating finite pattern. These two crucial properties of finiteness and periodicity admit a characterization of all members of the tree by finitely many parametrized presentations. Consequently, descendant trees play a fundamental role in the classification of finite p-groups. By means of kernels and targets of Artin transfer homomorphisms, descendant trees can be endowed with additional structure.
Definitions and terminology
According to M. F. Newman ,1 there exist several distinct definitions of the parent

 
  of a finite p-group 
 
 
 
 . The common principle is to form the quotient

 
  of 
 
 
 
  by a suitable normal subgroup

 
  which can be
:# either the centre

 
  of 
 
 
 
 , whence 
 
 
 
  is called the central quotient of 
 
 

:# or the last non-trivial term 
 
 
 
  of the lower central series of 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the nilpotency class of 
 
 

:# or the last non-trivial term 
 
 
 
  of the lower exponent-p central series of 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the exponent-p class of 
 
 

:# or the last non-trivial term 
 
 
 
  of the derived series of 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the derived length of 
 
 
 
 .
In each case, 
 
 
 
  is called an immediate descendant of 
 
 
 
  and a directed edge of the tree is defined either by 
 
 
 
  in the direction of the canonical projection

 
  onto the quotient 
 
 
 
  or by 
 
 
 
  in the opposite direction, which is more usual for descendant trees. The former convention is adopted by C. R. Leedham-Green and M. F. Newman ,2 by M. du Sautoy and D. Segal ,3 by C. R. Leedham-Green and S. McKay ,4 and by B. Eick, C. R. Leedham-Green, M. F. Newman and E. A. O'Brien .5 The latter definition is used by M. F. Newman ,6 by M. F. Newman and E. A. O'Brien ,7 by M. du Sautoy ,8 and by B. Eick and C. R. Leedham-Green .9
In the following, the direction of the canonical projections is selected for all edges. Then, more generally, a vertex 
 
 
 
  is a descendant of a vertex 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is an ancestor of 
 
 
 
 , if either 
 
 
 
  is equal to 
 
 
 
  or there is a path

 
 , with 
 
 
 
 , of directed edges from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . The vertices forming the path necessarily coincide with the iterated parents

 
  of 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 . In the most important special case (2.) of parents defined as last non-trivial lower central quotients, they can also be viewed as the successive quotients

of class

 
  of 
 
 
 
  when the nilpotency class of 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 .
Generally, the descendant tree

 
  of a vertex 
 
 
 
  is the subtree of all descendants of 
 
 
 
 , starting at the root

 
 . The maximal possible descendant tree 
 
 
 
  of the trivial group 
 
 
 
  contains all finite p-groups and is somewhat exceptional, since, for any parent definition (1.–4.), the trivial group 
 
 
 
  has infinitely many abelian p-groups as its immediate descendants. The parent definitions (2.–3.) have the advantage that any non-trivial finite p-group (of order divisible by 
 
 
 
 ) possesses only finitely many immediate descendants.
Pro-p groups and coclass trees
For a sound understanding of coclass trees as a particular instance of descendant trees, it is necessary to summarize some facts concerning infinite topological pro-p groups. The members 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 , of the lower central series of a pro-p group 
 
 
 
  are closed subgroups of finite index, and therefore the corresponding quotients 
 
 
 
  are finite p-groups. The pro-p group 
 
 
 
  is said to be of coclass

 
  when the limit 
 
 
 
  of the coclass of the successive quotients exists and is finite. An infinite pro-p group 
 
 
 
  of coclass 
 
 
 
  is a p-adic pre-space group ,10 since it has a normal subgroup 
 
 
 
 , the translation group, which is a free module over the ring 
 
 
 
  of p-adic integers of uniquely determined rank 
 
 
 
 , the dimension, such that the quotient 
 
 
 
  is a finite p-group, the point group, which acts on 
 
 
uniserially. The dimension is given by 
 
 
 
 , with some 
 
 
 
  is provided by the so-called Theorem D, which is one of the five Coclass Theorems proved in 1994 independently by A. Shalev 11 and by C. R. Leedham-Green ,12 and conjectured in 1980 already by C. R. Leedham-Green and M. F. Newman.13 Theorem D asserts that there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of infinite pro-p groups of coclass 
 
 
 
 , for any fixed prime 
 
 
 
  and any fixed non-negative integer 
 
 
 
 . As a consequence, if 
 
 
 
  is an infinite pro-p group of coclass 
 
 
 
 , then there exists a minimal integer 
 
 
 
  such that the following three conditions are satisfied for any integer 
 
 
 
 .
:*
 
 
 
 ,
:*
 
 
 
  is not a lower central quotient of any infinite pro-p group of coclass 
 
 
 
  which is not isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 ,
:*
 
 
 
  is cyclic of order 
 
 
 
 . The descendant tree 
 
 
 
 , with respect to the parent definition (2.), of the root 
 
 
 
  with minimal 
 
 
 
  is called the coclass tree

 
  of 
 
 
 
  and its unique maximal infinite (reverse-directed) path 
 
 
 
  is called the mainline (or trunk) of the tree.
(Figure)
Figure 1: A descendant tree. The branches B(2),B(4) have depth 0, and B(5),B(7), resp. B(6),B(8), are isomorphic as trees.

Tree diagram
Further terminology, used in diagrams visualizing descendant trees, is explained in Figure 1 by means of an artificial abstract tree. On the left hand side, a level indicates the basic top-down design of a descendant tree. For concrete trees, such as those in Figure 2,3 etc., the level is usually replaced by a scale of orders increasing from the top to the bottom. A vertex is capable (or extendable) if it has at least one immediate descendant, otherwise it is terminal (or a leaf). Vertices sharing a common parent are called siblings.
If the descendant tree is a coclass tree 
 
 
 
  with root 
 
 
 
  and with mainline vertices 
 
 
 
  labelled according to the level 
 
 
 
 , then the finite subtree defined as the difference set 
 
 
 
  is called the nth branch (or twig) of the tree or also the branch

with root

 
 , for any 
 
 
 
 . The depth of a branch is the maximal length of the paths connecting its vertices with its root. If all vertices of depth bigger than a given integer 
 
 
 
  are removed from branch 
 
 
 
 , then we obtain the (depth-)pruned branch

 
 . Correspondingly, the pruned coclass tree

 
 , resp. the entire coclass tree 
 
 
 
 , consists of the infinite sequence of its pruned branches 
 
 
 
 , resp. branches 
 
 
 
 , connected by the mainline, whose vertices 
 
 
 
  are called infinitely capable.
Virtual periodicity
The periodicity of branches of depth-pruned coclass trees has been proved with analytic methods using zeta functions 14 of groups by M. du Sautoy ,15 and with algebraic techniques using cohomology groups by B. Eick and C. R. Leedham-Green .16 The former methods admit the qualitative insight of ultimate virtual periodicity, the latter techniques determine the quantitative structure:
For any infinite pro-p group 
 
 
 
  of coclass 
 
 
 
  and dimension 
 
 
 
 , and for any given depth 
 
 
 
 , there exists an effective minimal lower bound 
 
 
 
 , where periodicity of length

 
  of pruned branches of the coclass tree 
 
 
 
  sets in, that is, there exist graph isomorphisms 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
These central results can be expressed ostensively: When we look at a coclass tree through a pair of blinkers and ignore a finite number of pre-periodic branches at the top, then we shall see a repeating finite pattern (ultimate periodicity). However, if we take wider blinkers the pre-periodic initial section may become longer (virtual periodicity).
The vertex 
 
 
 
  is called the periodic root of the pruned coclass tree, for a fixed value of the depth 
 
 
 
 .
Multifurcation and coclass graphs
Assume that parents of finite p-groups are defined as last non-trivial lower central quotients (2.). For a p-group 
 
 
 
  of coclass 
 
 
 
 , we can distinguish its (entire) descendant tree 
 
 
 
  and its coclass-
 
 
descendent tree

 
 , the subtree consisting of descendants of coclass 
 
 
 
  only. The group 
 
 
 
  is coclass settled if 
 
 
 
 .
The nuclear rank

 
  of 
 
 
 
  in the theory of the p-group generation algorithm by M. F. Newman 17 and E. A. O'Brien 18 provides the following criteria.
:*
 
 
 
  is terminal (and thus trivially coclass settled) if and only if 
 
 
 
 .
:*If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is capable. (But it remains unknown whether 
 
 
 
  is coclass settled.)
:*If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is capable but not coclass settled.
In the last case, a more precise assertion is possible: If 
 
 
 
  has coclass 
 
 
 
  and nuclear rank 
 
 
 
 , then it gives rise to an m-fold multifurcation into a regular coclass-r descendant tree

 
  and 
 
 
irregular descendant trees

 
  of coclass 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 
 
 . Consequently, the descendant tree of 
 
 
 
  is the disjoint union 
 
 
 
 .
Multifurcation is correlated with different orders of the last non-trivial lower central of immediate descendants. Since the nilpotency class increases exactly by a unit, 
 
 
 
 , from a parent 
 
 
 
  to any immediate descendant 
 
 
 
 , the coclass remains stable, 
 
 
 
 , if 
 
 
 
 . In this case, 
 
 
 
  is a regular immediate descendant with directed edge 
 
 
 
  of depth 1 (as usual). However, the coclass increases by 
 
 
 
 , if 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is called an irregular immediate descendant with directed edge of depth

 
 .
If the condition of depth (or step size) 1 is imposed on all directed edges, then the maximal descendant tree 
 
 
 
  of the trivial group 
 
 
 
  splits into a countably infinite disjoint union 
 
 
 
  of directed coclass graphs

 
 , which are rather forests than trees. More precisely, the above mentioned Coclass Theorems imply that 
 
 
 
  is the disjoint union of finitely many coclass trees 
 
 
 
  of (pairwise non-isomorphic) infinite pro-p groups 
 
 
 
  of coclass 
 
 
 
  (Theorem D) and a finite subgraph 
 
 
 
  of sporadic groups lying outside of any coclass tree.
Identifiers
The SmallGroups Library identifiers of finite groups, in particular p-groups, given in the form 
 
 
 
  in the following concrete examples of descendant trees, are due to H. U. Besche, B. Eick and E. A. O'Brien .19 20 When the group orders are given in a scale on the left hand side as in Figure 2 and Figure 3, the identifiers are briefly denoted by 
 
 
 
 .
Depending on the prime 
 
 
 
 , there is an upper bound on the order of groups for which a SmallGroup identifier exists, e. g. 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 . For groups of bigger orders, a notation resembling the descendant structure is employed: A regular immediate descendant, connected by an edge of depth 
 
 
 
  with its parent 
 
 
 
 , is denoted by 
 
 
 
 , and an irregular immediate descendant, connected by an edge of depth 
 
 
 
  with its parent 
 
 
 
 , is denoted by 
 
 
 
 .
Concrete examples
In all examples, the underlying parent definition (2.) corresponds to the usual lower central series. Occasional differences to the parent definition (3.) with respect to the lower exponent-p central series are pointed out.
Coclass 0
The coclass graph 
 
 
 
  of finite p-groups of coclass 
 
 
 
  does not contain a coclass tree and consists of the trivial group

 
  and the cyclic group

 
  of order 
 
 
 
 , which is a leaf (however, it is capable with respect to the lower exponent-p central series). For 
 
 
 
  the SmallGroup identifier of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 
 
  it is 
 
 
 
 .
(Figure)
Figure 2: The coclass graph of finite 2-groups with coclass 1

Coclass 1
The coclass graph 
 
 
 
  of finite p-groups of coclass 
 
 
 
  consists of the unique coclass tree with root 
 
 
 
 , the elementary abelian p-group of rank

 
 , and a single isolated vertex (a terminal orphan without proper parent in the same coclass graph, since the directed edge to the trivial group 
 
 
 
  has depth 
 
 
 
 ), the cyclic group

 
  of order 
 
 
 
  in the sporadic part 
 
 
 
  (however, this group is capable with respect to the lower exponent-p central series). The tree 
 
 
 
  is the coclass tree of the unique infinite pro-p group 
 
 
 
  of coclass 
 
 
 
 .
For 
 
 
 
 , resp. 
 
 
 
 , the SmallGroup identifier of the root 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , resp. 
 
 
 
 , and a tree diagram of the coclass graph from branch 
 
 
 
  up to branch 
 
 
 
  (counted with respect to the p-logarithm of the order of the branch root) is drawn in Figure 2, resp. Figure 3, where all groups of order at least 
 
 
 
  are metabelian, that is non-abelian with derived length 
 
 
 
  (vertices represented by black discs in contrast to contour squares indicating abelian groups). In Figure 3, smaller black discs denote metabelian 3-groups where even the maximal subgroups are non-abelian, a feature which does not occur for the metabelian 2-groups in Figure 2, since they all possess an abelian subgroup of index 
 
 
 
  (usually exactly one). The coclass tree of 
 
 
 
 , resp. 
 
 
 
 , has periodic root 
 
 
 
  and period of length 
 
 
 
  starting with branch 
 
 
 
 , resp. periodic root 
 
 
 
  and period of length 
 
 
 
  starting with branch 
 
 
 
 . Both trees have branches of bounded depth 
 
 
 
 , so their virtual periodicity is in fact a strict periodicity.
However, the coclass tree of 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  has unbounded depth and contains non-metabelian groups, and the coclass tree of 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  has even unbounded width, that is the number of descendants of a fixed order increases indefinitely with growing order .21
With the aid of kernels and targets of Artin transfers, the diagrams in Figure 2,3 can be endowed with additional information and redrawn as structured descendant trees.
The concrete examples 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  provide an opportunity to give a parametrized power-commutator presentation 22 (here a polycyclic presentation) for the complete coclass tree, mentioned in the lead section as a benefit of the descendant tree concept and as a consequence of the periodicity of the pruned coclass tree. In both cases, the group 
 
 
 
  is generated by two elements 
 
 
 
  but the presentation contains the series of higher commutators

 
 , 
 
 
 
 , starting with the main commutator

 
 . The nilpotency is formally expressed by 
 
 
 
 , when the group is of order 
 
 
 
 .

Figure 3: The coclass graph of finite 3-groups with coclass 1

For 
 
 
 
 , there are two parameters 
 
 
 
  and the pc-presentation is given by



The 2-groups of maximal class, that is of coclass 
 
 
 
 , form three periodic infinite sequences,
:*the dihedral groups, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , forming the mainline (with infinitely capable vertices),
:*the generalized quaternion groups, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , which are all terminal vertices,
:*the semidihedral groups, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , which are also leaves.
For 
 
 
 
 , there are three parameters 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and the pc-presentation is given by



3-groups with parameter 
 
 
 
  possess an abelian maximal subgroup, those with parameter 
 
 
 
  do not. More precisely, an existing abelian maximal subgroup is unique, except for the two groups 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where all four maximal subgroups are abelian.
In contrast to any bigger coclass 
 
 
 
 , the coclass graph 
 
 
 
  exclusively contains p-groups 
 
 
 
  with abelianization 
 
 
 
  of type 
 
 
 
 , except for its unique isolated vertex. The case 
 
 
 
  is distinguished by the truth of the reverse statement: Any 
 
 
 
 -group with abelianization of type 
 
 
 
  is of coclass 
 
 
 
  (O. Taussky's Theorem 23).

Coclass 2
The genesis of the coclass graph 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  is not uniform. p-groups with several distinct abelianizations contribute to its constitution. For coclass 
 
 
 
 , there are essential contributions from groups 
 
 
 
  with abelianizations 
 
 
 
  of the types 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and an isolated contribution by the cyclic group of order 
 
 
 
 .
Abelianization of type (p,p)
As opposed to p-groups of coclass 
 
 
 
  with abelianization of type 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 , which arise as regular descendants of abelian p-groups of the same types, p-groups of coclass 
 
 
 
  with abelianization of type 
 
 
 
  arise from irregular descendants of a non-abelian p-group of coclass 
 
 
 
  which is not coclass settled.
For the prime 
 
 
 
 , such groups do not exist at all, since the group 
 
 
 
  is coclass settled, which is the deeper reason for Taussky's Theorem. This remarkable fact has been observed by G. Bagnera 24 in 1898 already.
For odd primes 
 
 
 
 , the existence of p-groups of coclass 
 
 
 
  with abelianization of type 
 
 
 
  is due to the fact that the group 
 
 
 
  is not coclass settled. Its nuclear rank equals 
 
 
 
 , which gives rise to a bifurcation of the descendant tree 
 
 
 
  into two coclass graphs. The regular component 
 
 
 
  is a subtree of the unique tree 
 
 
 
  in the coclass graph 
 
 
 
 . The irregular component 
 
 
 
  becomes a subgraph 
 
 
 
  of the coclass graph 
 
 
 
  when the connecting edges of depth 
 
 
 
  of the irregular immediate descendants of 
 
 
 
  are removed.
For 
 
 
 
 , this subgraph 
 
 
 
  is drawn in Figure 4. It has seven top level vertices of three important kinds, all having order 
 
 
 
 , which have been discovered by G. Bagnera .25
:*Firstly, there are two terminal Schur σ-groups

 
  and 
 
 
 
  in the sporadic part 
 
 
 
  of the coclass graph 
 
 
 
 .
:*Secondly, the two groups 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are roots of finite trees 
 
 
 
  in the sporadic part 
 
 
 
  (however, since they are not coclass settled, the complete trees 
 
 
 
  are infinite) .
:*And, finally, the three groups 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  give rise to (infinite) coclass trees, e. g., 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , each having a metabelian mainline, in the coclass graph 
 
 
 
  (again, none of these three groups is coclass settled). Displaying additional information on kernels and targets of Artin transfers, we can draw these trees as structured descendant trees.
Generally, a Schur group (called a closed group by I. Schur, who coined the concept) is a pro-p group 
 
 
 
  whose relation rank 
 
 
 
  coincides with its generator rank 
 
 
 
 . A σ-group is a pro-p group 
 
 
 
  which possesses an automorphism 
 
 
 
  inducing the inversion 
 
 
 
  on its abelianization 
 
 
 
 . A Schur σ-group is a Schur group 
 
 
 
  which is also a σ-group and has a finite abelianization 
 
 
 
 .
It should be pointed out that 
 
 
 
  is not root of a coclass tree, since its immediate descendant 
 
 
 
 , which is root of a coclass tree with metabelian mainline vertices, has two siblings 
 
 
 
 , resp. 
 
 
 
 , which give rise to a single, resp. three, coclass tree(s) with non-metabelian mainline vertices having cyclic centres of order 
 
 
 
  and branches of considerable complexity but nevertheless of bounded depth 
 
 
 
 .

Pro-3 groups of coclass 2 with non-trivial centre
B. Eick, C. R. Leedham-Green, M. F. Newman and E. A. O'Brien 27 have constructed a family of infinite pro-3 groups with coclass 
 
 
 
  having a non-trivial centre of order 
 
 
 
 . The members are characterized by three parameters 
 
 
 
 . Their finite quotients generate all mainline vertices with bicyclic centres of type 
 
 
 
  of six coclass trees in the coclass graph 
 
 
 
 . The association of parameters to the roots of these six trees is given in Table 1, the tree diagrams are indicated in Figures 4 and 5, and the parametrized pro-3 presentation is given by

Abelianization of type (p²,p)
For 
 
 
 
 , the top levels of the subtree 
 
 
 
  of the coclass graph 
 
 
 
  are drawn in Figure 5. The most important vertices of this tree are the eight siblings sharing the common parent 
 
 
 
 , which are of three important kinds.
:*Firstly, there are three leaves 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  having cyclic centre of order 
 
 
 
 , and a single leaf 
 
 
 
  with bicyclic centre of type 
 
 
 
 .
:*Secondly, the group 
 
 
 
  is root of a finite tree 
 
 
 
 .
:*And, finally, the three groups 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  give rise to infinite coclass trees, e. g., 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , each having a metabelian mainline, the first with cyclic centres of order 
 
 
 
 , the second and third with bicyclic centres of type 
 
 
 
 .
Here, it should be emphasized that 
 
 
 
  is not root of a coclass tree, since aside from its descendant 
 
 
 
 , which is root of a coclass tree with metabelian mainline vertices, it possesses five further descendants which give rise to coclass trees with non-metabelian mainline vertices having cyclic centres of order 
 
 
 
  and branches of considerable complexity, here partially even with unbounded depth. 28

Abelianization of type (p,p,p)
For 
 
 
 
 , resp. 
 
 
 
 , there exists a unique coclass tree with p-groups of type 
 
 
 
  in the coclass graph 
 
 
 
 . Its root is the elementary abelian p-group of type 
 
 
 
 , that is, 
 
 
 
 , resp. 
 
 
 
 . This unique tree corresponds to the pro-2 group of the family 
 
 
 
  by M. F. Newman and E. A. O'Brien, 29 resp. the pro-3 group given by the parameters 
 
 
 
  in Table 1. For 
 
 
 
 , the tree is indicated in Figure 6.
Coclass 3
Here again, p-groups with several distinct abelianizations contribute to the constitution of the coclass graph 
 
 
 
  . There are regular, resp. irregular, essential contributions from groups 
 
 
 
  with abelianizations 
 
 
 
  of the types 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , resp. 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and an isolated contribution by the cyclic group of order 
 
 
 
 .
Abelianization of type (p,p,p)
Since the elementary abelian p-group 
 
 
 
  of rank 
 
 
 
 , that is, 
 
 
 
 , resp. 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 
 
 , resp.

Seven of these nine top level vertices have been investigated by E. Benjamin, F. Lemmermeyer and C. Snyder 32 with respect to their occurrence as class-2 quotients 
 
 
 
  of bigger metabelian 2-groups 
 
 
 
  of type 
 
 
 
  and with coclass 
 
 
 
 , which are exactly the members of the descendant trees of the seven vertices. These authors use the classification of 2-groups by M. Hall and J. K. Senior 33 which is put in correspondence with the SmallGroups Library 34 in Table 2. The complexity of the descendant trees of these seven vertices increases with the 2-ranks and 4-ranks indicated in Table 2, where the maximal subgroups of index 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  are denoted by 
 
 
 
 , for $1\le i\le 7$.
History
Descendant trees with central quotients as parents (1.) are implicit in P. Hall's 1940 paper 35 about isoclinism of groups. Trees with last non-trivial lower central quotients as parents (2.) were first presented by C. R. Leedham-Green at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Vancouver, 1974 .36 The first extensive tree diagrams have been drawn manually by J. A. Ascione, G. Havas and C. R. Leedham-Green (1977) ,37 by J. A. Ascione (1979) ,38 and by B. Nebelung (1989) .39 In the former two cases, the parent definition by means of the lower exponent-p central series (3.) was adopted in view of computational advantages, in the latter case, where theoretical aspects were focussed, the parents were taken with respect to the usual lower central series (2.).

The kernels and targets of Artin transfers have recently turned out to be compatible with parent-descendant relations between finite p-groups and can favourably be used to endow descendant trees with additional structure.
