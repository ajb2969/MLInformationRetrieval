   N-carbamoyl-L-amino-acid hydrolase      N-carbamoyl-L-amino-acid hydrolase   In enzymology , a N-carbamoyl-L-amino-acid hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-carbamoyl-L-2-amino acid (a 2-ureido carboxylate) + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-2-amino acid + NH 3 + CO 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-carbamoyl-L-2-amino acid and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are L-2-amino acid , NH 3 , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-carbamoyl-L-amino acid amidohydrolase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
