N-carbamoyl-L-amino-acid hydrolase




N-carbamoyl-L-amino-acid hydrolase

In enzymology, a N-carbamoyl-L-amino-acid hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-carbamoyl-L-2-amino acid (a 2-ureido carboxylate) + H2O 
 
 
 
  L-2-amino acid + NH3 + CO2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-carbamoyl-L-2-amino acid and H2O, whereas its 3 products are L-2-amino acid, NH3, and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-carbamoyl-L-amino acid amidohydrolase.
