   Twisted cubic      Twisted cubic   In mathematics , a twisted cubic is a smooth, rational curve  C of degree three in projective 3-space  P 3 . It is a fundamental example of a skew curve . It is essentially unique, up to projective transformation ( the twisted cubic, therefore). It is generally considered to be the simplest example of a projective variety that isn't linear or a hypersurface , and is given as such in most textbooks on algebraic geometry . It is the three-dimensional case of the rational normal curve , and is the image of a Veronese map of degree three on the projective line.  Definition  (Figure)  Twisted cubic curve.png   It is most easily given parametrically as the image of the map      ŒΩ  :    ùêè  1   ‚Üí   ùêè  3       normal-:  ŒΩ   normal-‚Üí   superscript  ùêè  1    superscript  ùêè  3      \nu:\mathbf{P}^{1}\to\mathbf{P}^{3}     which assigns to the homogeneous coordinate     [   S  :  T   ]     delimited-[]   normal-:  S  T     [S:T]   the value      ŒΩ  :   [  S  :  T  ]   ‚Ü¶   [   S  3   :   S  2   T  :  S   T  2   :   T  3   ]   .     fragments  ŒΩ  normal-:   fragments  normal-[  S  normal-:  T  normal-]   maps-to   fragments  normal-[   superscript  S  3   normal-:   superscript  S  2   T  normal-:  S   superscript  T  2   normal-:   superscript  T  3   normal-]   normal-.    \nu:[S:T]\mapsto[S^{3}:S^{2}T:ST^{2}:T^{3}].     In one coordinate patch of projective space, the map is simply the moment curve      ŒΩ  :   x  ‚Ü¶   (  x  ,   x  2   ,   x  3   )       normal-:  ŒΩ   maps-to  x   x   superscript  x  2    superscript  x  3       \nu:x\mapsto(x,x^{2},x^{3})     That is, it is the closure by a single point at infinity of the affine curve     (  x  ,   x  2   ,   x  3   )     x   superscript  x  2    superscript  x  3     (x,x^{2},x^{3})   .  Equivalently, it is a projective variety , defined as the zero locus of three smooth quadrics . Given the homogeneous coordinates [ X:Y:Z:W ] on P 3 , it is the zero locus of the three homogeneous polynomials       F  0   =    X  Z   -   Y  2         subscript  F  0       X  Z    superscript  Y  2      F_{0}=XZ-Y^{2}          F  1   =    Y  W   -   Z  2         subscript  F  1       Y  W    superscript  Z  2      F_{1}=YW-Z^{2}           F  2   =    X  W   -   Y  Z     .       subscript  F  2       X  W     Y  Z      F_{2}=XW-YZ.     It may be checked that these three quadratic forms vanish identically when using the explicit parameterization above; that is, substituting x 3 for X , and so on.  In fact, the homogeneous ideal of the twisted cubic C is generated by three algebraic forms of degree two on P 3 . The generators of the ideal are       {    X  Z   -   Y  2    ,    Y  W   -   Z  2    ,    X  W   -   Y  Z    }   .         X  Z    superscript  Y  2        Y  W    superscript  Z  2        X  W     Y  Z      \{XZ-Y^{2},YW-Z^{2},XW-YZ\}.     Properties  The twisted cubic has an assortment of elementary properties:   It is the set-theoretic complete intersection of XZ - Y 2 and     Z   (    Y  W   -   Z  2    )    -   W   (    X  W   -   Y  Z    )          Z      Y  W    superscript  Z  2       W      X  W     Y  Z       Z(YW-Z^{2})-W(XW-YZ)   , but not a scheme-theoretic or ideal-theoretic complete intersection (the resulting ideal is not radical, since     (    Y  W   -   Z  2    )   2     superscript      Y  W    superscript  Z  2    2    (YW-Z^{2})^{2}   is in it, but     Y  W   -   Z  2         Y  W    superscript  Z  2     YW-Z^{2}   is not).  Any four points on C span P 3 .  Given six points in P 3 with no four coplanar, there is a unique twisted cubic passing through them.  The union of the tangent and secant lines, the secant variety , of a twisted cubic C fill up P 3 and the lines are pairwise disjoint, except at points of the curve itself. In fact, the union of the tangent and secant lines of any non-planar smooth algebraic curve is three-dimensional. Further, any smooth algebraic variety with the property that every length four subscheme spans P 3 has the property that the tangent and secant lines are pairwise disjoint, except at points of the variety itself.  The projection of C onto a plane from a point on a tangent line of C yields a cuspidal cubic .  The projection from a point on a secant line of C yields a nodal cubic .  The projection from a point on C yields a conic section .   References    .   "  Category:Algebraic curves
