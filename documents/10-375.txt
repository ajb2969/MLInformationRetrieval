   Willmore conjecture      Willmore conjecture   In differential geometry , an area of mathematics , the Willmore conjecture is a theorem about the Willmore energy of a torus , named after the English  mathematician  Tom Willmore . 1  Willmore energy  Let v : M → R 3 be a smooth  immersion of a compact , orientable surface . Giving M the Riemannian metric induced by v , let H : M → R be the mean curvature (the arithmetic mean of the principal curvatures  κ 1 and κ 2 at each point). In this notation, the Willmore energy  W ( M ) of M is given by        W   (  M  )    =    ∫  M      H  2    d  A     .        W  M     subscript   M      superscript  H  2   d  A      W(M)=\int_{M}H^{2}\,dA.     It is not hard to prove that the Willmore energy satisfies W ( M ) ≥ 4 π , with equality if and only if  M is an embedded round sphere .  The conjecture  Calculation of W ( M ) for a few examples suggests that there should be a better bound than W ( M ) ≥ 4 π for surfaces with genus  g ( M ) > 0. In particular, calculation of W ( M ) for tori with various symmetries led Willmore to propose in 1965 the following conjecture, which now bears his name   For every smooth immersed torus M in R 3 , W ( M ) ≥ 2 π 2 .   In 2012, Fernando Codá Marques and André Neves proved the conjecture using the Almgren–Pitts min-max theory of minimal surfaces . 2 3 Martin Schmidt had already announced a proof in 2002, 4 but it was not accepted for publication in any peer-reviewed mathematical journal.
