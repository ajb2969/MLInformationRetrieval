Willmore conjecture

In differential geometry, an area of mathematics, the Willmore conjecture is a theorem about the Willmore energy of a torus, named after the English mathematician Tom Willmore.1
Willmore energy
Let v : M → R3 be a smooth immersion of a compact, orientable surface. Giving M the Riemannian metric induced by v, let H : M → R be the mean curvature (the arithmetic mean of the principal curvatures κ1 and κ2 at each point). In this notation, the Willmore energy W(M) of M is given by



It is not hard to prove that the Willmore energy satisfies W(M) ≥ 4π, with equality if and only if M is an embedded round sphere.
The conjecture
Calculation of W(M) for a few examples suggests that there should be a better bound than W(M) ≥ 4π for surfaces with genus g(M) > 0. In particular, calculation of W(M) for tori with various symmetries led Willmore to propose in 1965 the following conjecture, which now bears his name

For every smooth immersed torus M in R3, W(M) ≥ 2π2.
 

In 2012, Fernando Codá Marques and André Neves proved the conjecture using the Almgren–Pitts min-max theory of minimal surfaces.23 Martin Schmidt had already announced a proof in 2002,4 but it was not accepted for publication in any peer-reviewed mathematical journal.
