   Kv (flow factor)      Kv (flow factor)   The flow factor is the metric equivalent of Flow coefficient .  In more practical terms, the flow factor K v is the rate of flow of cold water in cubic metres per hour at a pressure drop of one kilogram per square centimetre across the valve. 1  K v can be calculated using:       K  v   =   F      S  G    Δ  P            subscript  K  v     F        S  G     normal-Δ  P        K_{v}=F\sqrt{\dfrac{SG}{\Delta P}}     where: K v = flow factor F = Rate of flow (cubic meters per hour). SG = Relative Specific gravity of fluid with reference to water(Water = 1). ΔP = Pressure drop across valve (1 bar or 100kPa).  K v is commonly used in Europe and Asia. K v can be calculated using the equation 2       K  v   =    (  0.865  )    (   C  v   )         subscript  K  v     0.865   subscript  C  v      {K_{v}}=(0.865)({C_{v}})     References  de:Kv-Wert "  Category:Fluid dynamics     ISBN 978-1-4005-2712-0 Flow of fluids through valves and fittings, Crane Co. ↩  Control Valve Handbook Search Chapter 5. ↩
