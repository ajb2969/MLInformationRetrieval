   Hubble–Reynolds law      Hubble–Reynolds law   The Hubble–Reynolds law models the surface brightness of elliptical galaxies as       I   (  R  )    =    I  0     (   1  +   R  /   R  H     )   2          I  R      subscript  I  0    superscript    1    R   subscript  R  H     2      I(R)=\frac{I_{0}}{(1+R/R_{H})^{2}}     Where    I   (  R  )       I  R    I(R)   is the surface brightness at radius   R   R   R   ,    I  0     subscript  I  0    I_{0}   is the central brightness, and    R  H     subscript  R  H    R_{H}   is the radius at which the surface brightness is diminished by a factor of 1/4. It is asymptotically similar to the de Vaucouleurs law which is a special case of the Sérsic law for elliptical galaxies. 1  The law is named for the astronomers Edwin Hubble and John Henry Reynolds .
