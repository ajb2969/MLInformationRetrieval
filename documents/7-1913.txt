Hubble–Reynolds law

The Hubble–Reynolds law models the surface brightness of elliptical galaxies as



Where 
 
 
 
  is the surface brightness at radius 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  is the central brightness, and 
 
 
 
  is the radius at which the surface brightness is diminished by a factor of 1/4. It is asymptotically similar to the de Vaucouleurs law which is a special case of the Sérsic law for elliptical galaxies.1
The law is named for the astronomers Edwin Hubble and John Henry Reynolds.
