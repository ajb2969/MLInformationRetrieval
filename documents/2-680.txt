   Special unitary group      Special unitary group   In mathematics, the special unitary group of degree   n   n   n   , denoted    S  U   (  n  )       S  U  n    SU(n)   , is the Lie group of    n  ×  n      n  normal-×  n    n×n    unitary  matrices with determinant 1 (i.e., real-valued determinant, not complex as for general unitary matrices). The group operation is that of matrix multiplication . The special unitary group is a subgroup of the unitary group     U   (  n  )       U  n    U(n)   , consisting of all    n  ×  n      n  normal-×  n    n×n   unitary matrices. As a compact classical group ,    U   (  n  )       U  n    U(n)   is the group that preserves the standard inner product on . 1 It is itself a subgroup of the general linear group ,    S  U   (  n  )   ⊂  U   (  n  )   ⊂  G  L   (  n  ,  𝐂  )       S  U  n  normal-⊂  U  n  normal-⊂  G  L   n  𝐂     SU(n)⊂U(n)⊂GL(n,\mathbf{C})   .  The    S  U   (  n  )       S  U  n    SU(n)   groups find wide application in the Standard Model of particle physics , especially     S  U   (  2  )       S  U  2    SU(2)    in the electroweak interaction and     S  U   (  3  )       S  U  3    SU(3)    in quantum chromodynamics . 2  The simplest case,    S  U   (  1  )       S  U  1    SU(1)   , is the trivial group , having only a single element. The group    S  U   (  2  )       S  U  2    SU(2)   is isomorphic to the group of quaternions of norm 1, and is thus diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere . Since unit quaternions can be used to represent rotations in 3-dimensional space (up to sign), there is a surjective  homomorphism from    S  U   (  2  )       S  U  2    SU(2)   to the rotation group    S  O   (  3  )       S  O  3    SO(3)    whose kernel is }. 3     S  U   (  2  )       S  U  2    SU(2)   is also identical to one of the symmetry groups of spinors , Spin (3), that enables a spinor presentation of rotations.  Properties  The special unitary group    S  U   (  n  )       S  U  n    SU(n)   is a real Lie group (though not a complex Lie group ). Its dimension as a real manifold is . Topologically, it is compact and simply connected . Algebraically, it is a simple Lie group (meaning its Lie algebra is simple; see below). 4  The center of    S  U   (  n  )       S  U  n    SU(n)   is isomorphic to the cyclic group  , and is composed of the diagonal matrices    ζ  I      ζ  I    ζI   for   ζ   ζ   ζ   an   n   n   n    th root of unity and   I   I   I   the n × n identity matrix.  Its outer automorphism group , for , is , while the outer automorphism group of    S  U   (  2  )       S  U  2    SU(2)   is the trivial group .  A maximal torus, of rank    n  −  1      n  normal-−  1    n−1   , is given by the set of diagonal matrices with determinant 1. The Weyl group is the symmetric group  , which is represented by signed permutation matrices (the signs being necessary to ensure the determinant is 1).  The Lie algebra of    S  U   (  n  )       S  U  n    SU(n)   , denoted by    𝐬𝐮   (  n  )       𝐬𝐮  n    \mathbf{su}(n)   , can be identified with the set of traceless  antihermitian     n  ×  n      n  normal-×  n    n×n   complex matrices, with the regular commutator as Lie bracket. Particle physicists often use a different, equivalent representation: the set of traceless hermitian     n  ×  n      n  normal-×  n    n×n   complex matrices with Lie bracket given by    −  i      normal-−  i    −i   times the commutator.  Infinitesimal generators  The Lie algebra    𝐬𝐮   (  n  )       𝐬𝐮  n    \mathbf{su}(n)   can be generated by operators     O  ^    i  j      subscript   normal-^  O     i  j     \hat{O}_{ij}   ,      i  ,  j   =  1   ,   2  ,  …  ,  n      formulae-sequence     i  j   1    2  normal-…  n     i,j=1,2,...,n   , which satisfy the commutator relationships       [    O  ^    i  j    ,    O  ^    k  ℓ    ]   =     δ   j  k      O  ^    i  ℓ     -    δ   i  ℓ      O  ^    k  j            subscript   normal-^  O     i  j     subscript   normal-^  O     k  normal-ℓ          subscript  δ    j  k     subscript   normal-^  O     i  normal-ℓ        subscript  δ    i  normal-ℓ     subscript   normal-^  O     k  j        \left[\hat{O}_{ij},\hat{O}_{k\ell}\right]=\delta_{jk}\hat{O}_{i\ell}-\delta_{i%
 \ell}\hat{O}_{kj}     for  = , where denotes the Kronecker delta . Additionally, the operator       N  ^   =    ∑   i  =  1   n     O  ^    i  i          normal-^  N     superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript   normal-^  O     i  i       \hat{N}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\hat{O}_{ii}     satisfies        [   N  ^   ,    O  ^    i  j    ]   =  0   ,        normal-^  N    subscript   normal-^  O     i  j     0    \left[\hat{N},\hat{O}_{ij}\right]=0,     which implies that the number of independent generators of the Lie algebra is . 5  Fundamental representation  In the defining, or fundamental, representation of    𝐬𝐮   (  n  )       𝐬𝐮  n    \mathbf{su}(n)   the generators are represented by traceless  hermitian matrices complex    n  ×  n      n  normal-×  n    n×n   matrices, where:        T  a    T  b    =     1   2  n     δ   a  b     I  n    +    1  2     ∑   c  =  1     n  2   -  1      (    i   f   a  b  c     +   d   a  b  c     )     T  c               subscript  T  a    subscript  T  b          1    2  n     subscript  δ    a  b     subscript  I  n        1  2     superscript   subscript     c  1       superscript  n  2   1          i   subscript  f    a  b  c      subscript  d    a  b  c      subscript  T  c         T_{a}T_{b}=\frac{1}{2n}\delta_{ab}I_{n}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{c=1}^{n^{2}-1}{(if_{%
 abc}+d_{abc})T_{c}}\,     where the   f   f   f   are the structure constants and are antisymmetric in all indices, while the   d   d   d   -coefficients are symmetric in all indices. As a consequence:        [   T  a   ,   T  b   ]   +   =     1  n    δ   a  b     I  n    +    ∑   c  =  1     n  2   -  1      d   a  b  c      T  c            subscript    subscript  T  a    subscript  T  b            1  n    subscript  δ    a  b     subscript  I  n      superscript   subscript     c  1       superscript  n  2   1       subscript  d    a  b  c     subscript  T  c        \left[T_{a},T_{b}\right]_{+}=\frac{1}{n}\delta_{ab}I_{n}+\sum_{c=1}^{n^{2}-1}{%
 d_{abc}T_{c}}\,            [   T  a   ,   T  b   ]   -   =   i    ∑   c  =  1     n  2   -  1      f   a  b  c      T  c        .       subscript    subscript  T  a    subscript  T  b        i    superscript   subscript     c  1       superscript  n  2   1       subscript  f    a  b  c     subscript  T  c        \left[T_{a},T_{b}\right]_{-}=i\sum_{c=1}^{n^{2}-1}{f_{abc}T_{c}}\,.     We also take        ∑    c  ,  e   =  1     n  2   -  1      d   a  c  e     d   b  c  e      =      n  2   -  4   n     δ   a  b            superscript   subscript      c  e   1       superscript  n  2   1       subscript  d    a  c  e     subscript  d    b  c  e             superscript  n  2   4   n    subscript  δ    a  b       \sum_{c,e=1}^{n^{2}-1}d_{ace}d_{bce}=\frac{n^{2}-4}{n}\delta_{ab}\,     as a normalization convention.  Adjoint representation  In the -dimensional adjoint representation , the generators are represented by × matrices, whose elements are defined by the structure constants themselves:         (   T  a   )    j  k    =   -   i   f   a  j  k       .       subscript   subscript  T  a     j  k        i   subscript  f    a  j  k        (T_{a})_{jk}=-if_{ajk}.     == n = 2 ==    S  U   (  2  )       S  U  2    SU(2)   is the following group,      SU   (  2  )   =   {   (     α     -   β  ¯        β     α  ¯      )   :  α  ,  β  ∈  𝐂  ,  |  α   |  2   +  |  β   |  2   =  1  }   ,     fragments  SU   fragments  normal-(  2  normal-)     fragments  normal-{    α     normal-¯  β      β   normal-¯  α     normal-:   α  normal-,  β   C  normal-,  normal-|  α   superscript  normal-|  2    normal-|  β   superscript  normal-|  2    1  normal-}   normal-,    \mathrm{SU}(2)=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}\alpha&-\overline{\beta}\\
 \beta&\overline{\alpha}\end{pmatrix}:\ \ \alpha,\beta\in\mathbf{C},|\alpha|^{2%
 }+|\beta|^{2}=1\right\}~{},   where the overline denotes complex conjugation .  Now, consider the following map,      φ  :   𝐂  2      normal-:  φ   superscript  𝐂  2     \displaystyle\varphi:\mathbf{C}^{2}   where    M   (  2  ,  𝐂  )       M   2  𝐂     M(2,\mathbf{C})   denotes the set of 2 by 2 complex matrices. By considering  diffeomorphic to and    M   (  2  ,  𝐂  )       M   2  𝐂     M(2,\mathbf{C})   diffeomorphic to , we can see that   φ   φ   φ   is an injective real linear map and hence an embedding. Now, considering the restriction of   φ   φ   φ   to the 3-sphere (since modulus is 1), denoted , we can see that this is an embedding of the 3-sphere onto a compact submanifold of    M   (  2  ,  𝐂  )       M   2  𝐂     M(2,\mathbf{C})   . However, it is also clear that .  Therefore, as a manifold is diffeomorphic to    S  U   (  2  )       S  U  2    SU(2)   and so    S  U   (  2  )       S  U  2    SU(2)   is a compact, connected Lie group .  The Lie algebra of    S  U   (  2  )       S  U  2    SU(2)   is        𝔰  𝔲   (  2  )    =   {   (      i  a      -   z  ¯        z     -   i  a       )   :    a  ∈  𝐑   ,   z  ∈  𝐂    }    .        𝔰  𝔲  2    conditional-set      i  a      normal-¯  z      z      i  a       formulae-sequence    a  𝐑     z  𝐂       \mathfrak{su}(2)=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}ia&-\overline{z}\\
 z&-ia\end{pmatrix}:\ a\in\mathbf{R},z\in\mathbf{C}\right\}~{}.     It is easily verified that matrices of this form have trace zero and are antihermitian . The Lie algebra is then generated by the following matrices,         u  1   =   (     0    i      i    0     )       u  2   =   (     0     -  1       1    0     )      u  3   =    (     i    0      0     -  i      )       ,     formulae-sequence     subscript  u  1     0  i    i  0      formulae-sequence     subscript  u  2     0    1     1  0        subscript  u  3     i  0    0    i         u_{1}=\begin{pmatrix}0&i\\
 i&0\end{pmatrix}\qquad u_{2}=\begin{pmatrix}0&-1\\
 1&0\end{pmatrix}\qquad u_{3}=\begin{pmatrix}i&0\\
 0&-i\end{pmatrix}~{},   which are easily seen to have the form of the general element specified above.  These satisfy and . The commutator bracket is therefore specified by         [   u  3   ,   u  1   ]   =   2   u  2     ,     [   u  1   ,   u  2   ]   =   2   u  3     ,    [   u  2   ,   u  3   ]   =   2    u  1        .     formulae-sequence      subscript  u  3    subscript  u  1      2   subscript  u  2      formulae-sequence      subscript  u  1    subscript  u  2      2   subscript  u  3         subscript  u  2    subscript  u  3      2   subscript  u  1        [u_{3},u_{1}]=2u_{2},\qquad[u_{1},u_{2}]=2u_{3},\qquad[u_{2},u_{3}]=2u_{1}~{}.     The above generators are related to the Pauli matrices by and . This representation is routinely used in quantum mechanics to represent the spin of fundamental particles such as electrons . They also serve as unit vectors for the description of our 3 spatial dimensions in loop quantum gravity .  The Lie algebra serves to work out the representations of    S  U   (  2  )       S  U  2    SU(2)    .  == n = 3 == The generators of    𝐬𝐮   (  3  )       𝐬𝐮  3    \mathbf{su}(3)   ,   T   T   T   , in the defining representation, are:        T  a   =    λ  a   2    .       subscript  T  a      subscript  λ  a   2     T_{a}=\frac{\lambda_{a}}{2}.\,   where   λ   λ   λ   the Gell-Mann matrices , are the    S  U   (  3  )       S  U  3    SU(3)   analog of the Pauli matrices for    S  U   (  2  )       S  U  2    SU(2)   :             λ  1   =   (     0    1    0      1    0    0      0    0    0     )        subscript  λ  1     0  1  0    1  0  0    0  0  0      \lambda_{1}=\begin{pmatrix}0&1&0\\

 \tfrac{\pi}{2}\right)   .  for elementary representation theory facts.  Lie algebra structure  The above representation bases generalize to , using generalized Pauli matrices .  If we choose an (arbitrary) particular basis, then the subspace of traceless diagonal     n  ×  n      n  normal-×  n    n×n   matrices with imaginary entries forms an -dimensional Cartan subalgebra .  Complexify the Lie algebra, so that any traceless    n  ×  n      n  normal-×  n    n×n   matrix is now allowed. The weight  eigenvectors are the Cartan subalgebra itself, as well as the matrices with only one nonzero entry which is off diagonal. Even though the Cartan subalgebra   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   is only , to simplify calculations, it is often convenient to introduce an auxiliary element, the unit matrix which commutes with everything else (which is not an element of the Lie algebra!) for the purpose of computing weights—and that only. So, we have a basis where the   i   i   i   -th basis vector is the matrix with 1 on the   i   i   i   -th diagonal entry and zero elsewhere. Weights would then be given by   n   n   n   coordinates and the sum over all   n   n   n   coordinates has to be zero (because the unit matrix is only auxiliary).  So,    S  U   (  n  )       S  U  n    SU(n)   is of rank and its Dynkin diagram is given by , a chain of  vertices, o−o−o−o---o. Its root system consists of  roots spanning a Euclidean space . Here, we use   n   n   n   redundant coordinates instead of  to emphasize the symmetries of the root system (the   n   n   n   coordinates have to add up to zero).  In other words, we are embedding this  dimensional vector space in an   n   n   n   -dimensional one. Thus, the roots consists of all the  permutations of    (  1  ,   −  1   ,  0  ,  …  ,  0  )     1    normal-−  1   0  normal-…  0    (1,−1,0,...,0)   . The construction given above explains why. A choice of simple roots is     (   normal-(   \displaystyle(     Its Cartan matrix is       (     2     -  1     0    …    0       -  1     2     -  1     …    0      0     -  1     2    …    0      ⋮    ⋮    ⋮    ⋱    ⋮      0    0    0    …    2     )   .      2    1   0  normal-…  0      1   2    1   normal-…  0    0    1   2  normal-…  0    normal-⋮  normal-⋮  normal-⋮  normal-⋱  normal-⋮    0  0  0  normal-…  2     \begin{pmatrix}2&-1&0&\dots&0\\

Generalized special unitary group  For a field    F   F   F   , the generalized special unitary group over F ,    S  U   (  p  ,  q  ;  F  )       S  U   p  q  F     SU(p,q;F)   , is the group of all linear transformations of determinant 1 of a vector space of rank  over   F   F   F   which leave invariant a nondegenerate , Hermitian form of signature     (  p  ,  q  )     p  q    (p,q)   . This group is often referred to as the special unitary group of signature    p  q      p  q    pq   over   F   F   F    . The field   F   F   F   can be replaced by a commutative ring , in which case the vector space is replaced by a free module .  Specifically, fix a Hermitian matrix    A   A   A   of signature    p  q      p  q    pq   in    G  L   (  n  ,  𝐑  )       G  L   n  𝐑     GL(n,\mathbf{R})   , then all      M  ∈   SU   (  p  ,  q  ,  R  )        M    SU   p  q  R      M\in\mathrm{SU}(p,q,R)     satisfy       M  *   A  M       superscript  M    A  M    \displaystyle M^{*}AM     Often one will see the notation    S  U   (  p  ,  q  )       S  U   p  q     SU(p,q)   without reference to a ring or field; in this case, the ring or field being referred to is   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   and this gives one of the classical Lie groups . The standard choice for   A   A   A   when  is       A  =   [     0    0    i      0     I   n  -  2      0       -  i     0    0     ]    .      A    0  0  i    0   subscript  I    n  2    0      i   0  0      A=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&i\\
 0&I_{n-2}&0\\
 -i&0&0\end{bmatrix}.     However there may be better choices for   A   A   A   for certain dimensions which exhibit more behaviour under restriction to subrings of   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   .  Example  An important example of this type of group is the Picard modular group     S  U   (  2  ,  1  ;  𝐙  i  i  )   )     fragments  S  U   fragments  normal-(  2  normal-,  1  normal-;  Z  i  i  normal-)   normal-)    SU(2,1;\mathbf{Z}ii))   which acts (projectively) on complex hyperbolic space of degree two, in the same way that    S  L   (  2  ,  9  ;  𝐙  )       S  L   2  9  𝐙     SL(2,9;\mathbf{Z})   acts (projectively) on real hyperbolic space of dimension two. In 2005 Gábor Francsics and Peter Lax computed an explicit fundamental domain for the action of this group on . 7  A further example is    S  U   (  1  ,  1  ;  𝐂  )       S  U   1  1  𝐂     SU(1,1;\mathbf{C})   , which is isomorphic to    S  L   (  2  ,  𝐑  )       S  L   2  𝐑     SL(2,\mathbf{R})   .  Important subgroups  In physics the special unitary group is used to represent bosonic symmetries. In theories of symmetry breaking it is important to be able to find the subgroups of the special unitary group. Subgroups of    S  U   (  n  )       S  U  n    SU(n)   that are important in GUT physics are, for ,       SU   (  n  )    ⊃       SU   (  p  )    ×  SU    (   n  -  p   )    ×  U    (  1  )                  SU  p   SU     n  p    normal-U   1     SU  n     \mathrm{SU}(n)\supset\mathrm{SU}(p)\times\mathrm{SU}(n-p)\times\mathrm{U}(1)   , where × denotes the direct product and    U   (  1  )       U  1    U(1)   , known as the circle group , is the multiplicative group of all complex numbers with absolute value 1.  For completeness, there are also the orthogonal and symplectic subgroups,      SU   (  n  )       SU  n    \displaystyle\mathrm{SU}(n)     Since the rank of    S  U   (  n  )       S  U  n    SU(n)   is  and of    U   (  1  )       U  1    U(1)   is 1, a useful check is that the sum of the ranks of the subgroups is less than or equal to the rank of the original group.    S  U   (  n  )       S  U  n    SU(n)   is a subgroup of various other Lie groups,      SO   (   2  n   )       SO    2  n     \displaystyle\mathrm{SO}(2n)   See spin group , and simple Lie groups for E 6 , E 7 , and G 2 .  There are also the accidental isomorphisms : , , 8 and .  One may finally mention that    S  U   (  2  )       S  U  2    SU(2)   is the double covering group of    S  O   (  3  )       S  O  3    SO(3)   , a relation that plays an important role in the theory of rotations of 2- spinors in non-relativistic quantum mechanics .
