   Wiener algebra      Wiener algebra   In mathematics, the Wiener algebra , named after Norbert Wiener and usually denoted by    A   (  𝐓  )       A  𝐓    A(\mathbf{T})   , is the space of absolutely convergent  Fourier series . 1 Here T denotes the circle group .  Banach algebra structure  The norm of a function    f  ∈  A   (  𝐓  )       f  normal-∈  A  𝐓    f∈A(\mathbf{T})   is given by        ∥  f  ∥   =    ∑   n  =   -  ∞    ∞    |    f  ^    (  n  )    |     ,       norm  f     superscript   subscript     n               normal-^  f   n       \|f\|=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}|\hat{f}(n)|,\,     where        f  ^    (  n  )    =    1   2  π      ∫   -  π   π    f   (  t  )     e   -   i  n  t      d  t            normal-^  f   n       1    2  π      superscript   subscript     π    π     f  t   superscript  e      i  n  t     d  t       \hat{f}(n)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(t)e^{-int}\,dt     is the n th Fourier coefficient of   f   f   f   . The Wiener algebra    A   (  𝐓  )       A  𝐓    A(\mathbf{T})   is closed under pointwise multiplication of functions. Indeed,      f   (  t  )   g   (  t  )       f  t  g  t    \displaystyle f(t)g(t)     therefore        ∥   f  g   ∥   =    ∑   n  ∈  ℤ     |    ∑   m  ∈  ℤ      f  ^    (   n  -  m   )    g  ^    (  m  )     |    ≤    ∑  m     |    f  ^    (  m  )    |     ∑  n    |    g  ^    (  n  )    |      =    ∥  f  ∥    ∥  g  ∥     .         norm    f  g      subscript     n  ℤ        subscript     m  ℤ       normal-^  f     n  m    normal-^  g   m             subscript   m          normal-^  f   m      subscript   n        normal-^  g   n               norm  f    norm  g       \|fg\|=\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\left|\sum_{m\in\mathbb{Z}}\hat{f}(n-m)\hat{g}(m)%
 \right|\leq\sum_{m}|\hat{f}(m)|\sum_{n}|\hat{g}(n)|=\|f\|\,\|g\|.\,     Thus the Wiener algebra is a commutative unitary Banach algebra . Also,    A   (  𝐓  )       A  𝐓    A(\mathbf{T})   is isomorphic to the Banach algebra , with the isomorphism given by the Fourier transform.  Properties  The sum of an absolutely convergent Fourier series is continuous, so       A   (  𝕋  )    ⊂   C   (  𝕋  )          A  𝕋     C  𝕋     A(\mathbb{T})\subset C(\mathbb{T})   where    C   (  𝐓  )       C  𝐓    C(\mathbf{T})   is the ring of continuous functions on the unit circle.  On the other hand an integration by parts , together with the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality and Parseval's formula , shows that         C  1    (  𝕋  )    ⊂   A   (  𝕋  )     .         superscript  C  1   𝕋     A  𝕋     C^{1}(\mathbb{T})\subset A(\mathbb{T}).\,   .  More generally,        Lip  α    (  𝕋  )    ⊂   A   (  𝕋  )    ⊂   C   (  𝕋  )             subscript  Lip  α   𝕋     A  𝕋          C  𝕋      \mathrm{Lip}_{\alpha}(\mathbb{T})\subset A(\mathbb{T})\subset C(\mathbb{T})     for    α  >   1  /  2       α    1  2     \alpha>1/2   (see ).  Wiener's 1/ f theorem  proved that if   f   f   f   has absolutely convergent Fourier series and is never zero, then its inverse    1  /  f      1  f    1/f   also has an absolutely convergent Fourier series. Many other proofs have appeared since then, including an elementary one by .  used the theory of Banach algebras that he developed to show that the maximal ideals of    A   (  𝐓  )       A  𝐓    A(\mathbf{T})   are of the form         M  x   =   {   f  ∈   A   (  𝕋  )     ∣    f   (  x  )    =  0   }    ,   x  ∈   𝕋     ,     formulae-sequence     subscript  M  x    conditional-set    f    A  𝕋        f  x   0       x  𝕋     M_{x}=\left\{f\in A(\mathbb{T})\,\mid\,f(x)=0\right\},\quad x\in\mathbb{T}~{},     which is equivalent to Wiener's theorem.
