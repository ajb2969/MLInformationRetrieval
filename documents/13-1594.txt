In five-dimensional geometry, a truncated 5-cube is a convex uniform 5-polytope, being a truncation of the regular 5-cube.
There are four unique truncations of the 5-cube. Vertices of the truncated 5-cube are located as pairs on the edge of the 5-cube. Vertices of the bitruncated 5-cube are located on the square faces of the 5-cube. The third and fourth truncations are more easily constructed as second and first truncations of the 5-orthoplex.

Construction and coordinates
The truncated 5-cube may be constructed by truncating the vertices of the 5-cube at 
 
 
 
  of the edge length. A regular 5-cell is formed at each truncated vertex.
The Cartesian coordinates of the vertices of a truncated 5-cube having edge length 2 are all permutations of:



Images
The truncated 5-cube is constructed by a truncation applied to the 5-cube. All edges are shortened, and two new vertices are added on each original edge.
