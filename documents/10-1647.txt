Glucose-6-phosphate 1-epimerase

In enzymology, a glucose-6-phosphate 1-epimerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

alpha-D-glucose 6-phosphate 
 
 
 
  beta-D-glucose 6-phosphate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, alpha-D-glucose 6-phosphate, and one product, beta-D-glucose 6-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on carbohydrates and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glucose-6-phosphate 1-epimerase. This enzyme participates in glycolysis / gluconeogenesis.
