   Polynomial lemniscate      Polynomial lemniscate   In mathematics, a polynomial lemniscate or polynomial level curve is a plane algebraic curve of degree 2n, constructed from a polynomial p with complex coefficients of degree n .  For any such polynomial p and positive real number c , we may define a set of complex numbers by      |   p   (  z  )    |   =  c   .          p  z    c    |p(z)|=c.   This set of numbers may be equated to points in the real Cartesian plane, leading to an algebraic curve ƒ ( x , y ) = c 2 of degree 2 n , which results from expanding out    p   (  z  )    p  ¯    (   z  ¯   )       p  z   normal-¯  p    normal-¯  z     p(z)\bar{p}(\bar{z})   in terms of z = x + iy .  When p is a polynomial of degree 1 then the resulting curve is simply a circle whose center is the zero of p . When p is a polynomial of degree 2 then the curve is a Cassini oval .  Erdős lemniscate  A conjecture of Erdős which has attracted considerable interest concerns the maximum length of a polynomial lemniscate ƒ ( x , y ) = 1 of degree 2 n when p is monic , which Erdős conjectured was attained when p ( z ) = z n − 1. This is still not proved but Fryntov and Nazarov proved that p gives a local maximum. 1 In the case when n = 2, the Erdős lemniscate is the Lemniscate of Bernoulli        (    x  2   +   y  2    )   2   =   2   (    x  2   -   y  2    )         superscript     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    2     2     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2       (x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}=2(x^{2}-y^{2})\,     and it has been proven that this is indeed the maximal length in degree four. The Erdős lemniscate has three ordinary n -fold points, one of which is at the origin, and a genus of ( n − 1)( n − 2)/2. By inverting the Erdős lemniscate in the unit circle, one obtains a nonsingular curve of degree n .  Generic polynomial lemniscate  In general, a polynomial lemniscate will not touch at the origin, and will have only two ordinary n -fold singularities, and hence a genus of ( n − 1) 2 . As a real curve, it can have a number of disconnected components. Hence, it will not look like a lemniscate, making the name something of a misnomer.  An interesting example of such polynomial lemniscates are the Mandelbrot curves. If we set p 0 = z , and p n = p n −1 2 + z , then the corresponding polynomial lemniscates M n defined by | p n ( z )| = 1 converge to the boundary of the Mandelbrot set . The Mandelbrot curves are of degree 2 n+1 . 2  See also   Lemniscate   Notes  References   Alexandre Eremenko and Walter Hayman , On the length of lemniscates , Michigan Math.
