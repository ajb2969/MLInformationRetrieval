   Equivalent latitude      Equivalent latitude   In differential geometry , the equivalent latitude is a Lagrangian coordinate . It is often used in atmospheric science , particularly in the study of stratospheric dynamics. Each isoline in a map of equivalent latitude follows the flow velocity and encloses the same area as the latitude line of equivalent value, hence "equivalent latitude." Equivalent latitude is calculated from potential vorticity , from passive tracer simulations and from actual measurements of atmospheric tracers such as ozone .  Calculation of equivalent latitude  The calculation of equivalent latitude involves creating a monotonic mapping between the values of equivalent latitude and the tracer it is based upon: higher values of the tracer map to higher values of equivalent latitude. A precise method is to assign a representative area to each of the tracer measurements, filling the entire globe. Thus, for a tracer field regularly gridded in longitude and latitude, grid points closer to the pole will take up a smaller area, in proportion to the cosine of the latitude. Now, rank all the tracer values then form the cumulative sum. The equivalent latitude from the area is given as:      ϕ  =    sin   -  1     (    A   2  π   R  2     -  1   )        ϕ    superscript     1        A    2  π   superscript  R  2     1      \phi=\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{A}{2\pi R^{2}}-1\right)     where A is the area enclosed to the South ( A = 0 corresponds to the equivalent South Pole) and R is the radius of the Earth. This method generates a mapping that is as continuous as the data allows as opposed to binning which produces a coarse-grained mapping.
