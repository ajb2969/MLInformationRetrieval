   16-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase      16-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 16alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a 16alpha-hydroxysteroid + NAD(P) +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a 16-oxosteroid + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 16alpha-hydroxysteroid , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are 16-oxosteroid , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 16alpha-hydroxysteroid:NAD(P) + 16-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called 16alpha-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase .
