   Doléans-Dade exponential      Doléans-Dade exponential   In stochastic calculus , the Doléans-Dade exponential , Doléans exponential , or stochastic exponential , of a semimartingale  X is defined to be the solution to the stochastic differential equation   Y t dX t }} with initial condition 1}} . The concept is named after Catherine Doléans-Dade . It is sometimes denoted by ( X ). In the case where X is differentiable, then Y is given by the differential equation  to which the solution is exp( X − X 0 )}} . Alternatively, if  σB t + μt }} for a Brownian motion  B , then the Doléans-Dade exponential is a geometric Brownian motion . For any continuous semimartingale X , applying Itō's lemma with  gives      d   log   (  Y  )        d    Y     \displaystyle d\log(Y)     Exponentiating gives the solution        Y  t   =   exp   (    X  t   -   X  0   -    1  2     [  X  ]   t     )     ,   t  ≥  0.      formulae-sequence     subscript  Y  t        subscript  X  t    subscript  X  0       1  2    subscript   delimited-[]  X   t         t  0.     Y_{t}=\exp\Bigl(X_{t}-X_{0}-\frac{1}{2}[X]_{t}\Bigr),\qquad t\geq 0.     This differs from what might be expected by comparison with the case where X is differentiable due to the existence of the quadratic variation term [ X ] in the solution.  The Doléans-Dade exponential is useful in the case when X is a local martingale . Then, ( X ) will also be a local martingale whereas the normal exponential exp( X ) is not. This is used in the Girsanov theorem . Criteria for a continuous local martingale X to ensure that its stochastic exponential ( X ) is actually a martingale are given by Kazamaki's condition , Novikov's condition , and Beneš' condition .  It is possible to apply Itō's lemma for non-continuous semimartingales in a similar way to show that the Doléans-Dade exponential of any semimartingale X is         Y  t   =    exp   (    X  t   -   X  0   -    1  2     [  X  ]   t     )      ∏   s  ≤  t      (   1  +   Δ   X  s     )    exp   (    -   Δ   X  s     +    1  2   Δ   X  s  2     )        ,   t  ≥  0    ,     formulae-sequence     subscript  Y  t          subscript  X  t    subscript  X  0       1  2    subscript   delimited-[]  X   t        subscript  product    s  t        1    normal-Δ   subscript  X  s             normal-Δ   subscript  X  s         1  2   normal-Δ   superscript   subscript  X  s   2            t  0     Y_{t}=\exp\Bigl(X_{t}-X_{0}-\frac{1}{2}[X]_{t}\Bigr)\prod_{s\leq t}(1+\Delta X%
 _{s})\exp\Bigl(-\Delta X_{s}+\frac{1}{2}\Delta X_{s}^{2}\Bigr),\qquad t\geq 0,     where the product extents over the (countable many) jumps of X up to time t .  See also   Stochastic logarithm   References     "  Category:Martingale theory  Category:Stochastic differential equations
