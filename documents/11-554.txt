Sialate O-acetylesterase

In enzymology, a sialate O-acetylesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-acetyl-O-acetylneuraminate + H2O 
 
 
 
  N-acetylneuraminate + acetate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-acetyl-O-acetylneuraminate and H2O, whereas its two products are N-acetylneuraminate and acetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-acyl-O-acetylneuraminate O-acetylhydrolase. Other names in common use include N-acetylneuraminate acetyltransferase, sialate 9(4)-O-acetylesterase, and sialidase.
