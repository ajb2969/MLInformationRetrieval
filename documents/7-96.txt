Bianchi group

In mathematics, a Bianchi group is a group of the form



where d is a positive square-free integer. Here, PSL denotes the projective special linear group and 
 
 
 
  is the ring of integers of the imaginary quadratic field

 
 .
The groups were first studied by  as a natural class of discrete subgroups of 
 
 
 
 , now termed Kleinian groups.
As a subgroup of 
 
 
 
 , a Bianchi group acts as orientation-preserving isometries of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space

 
 . The quotient space 
 
 
 
  is a non-compact, hyperbolic 3-fold with finite volume, which is also called Bianchi manifold. An exact formula for the volume, in terms of the Dedekind zeta function of the base field 
 
 
 
 , was computed by Humbert as follows. Let 
 
 
 
  be the discriminant of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , the discontinuous action on 
 
 
 
 , then



The set of cusps of 
 
 
 
  is in bijection with the class group of 
 
 
 
 . It is well known that any non-cocompact arithmetic Kleinian group is weakly commensurable with a Bianchi group.1
