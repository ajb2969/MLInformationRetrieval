   Bianchi group      Bianchi group   In mathematics , a Bianchi group is a group of the form      P  S   L  2    (   𝒪  d   )       P  S   subscript  L  2    subscript  𝒪  d     PSL_{2}(\mathcal{O}_{d})     where d is a positive square-free integer . Here, PSL denotes the projective special linear group and    𝒪  d     subscript  𝒪  d    \mathcal{O}_{d}   is the ring of integers of the imaginary quadratic field     ℚ   (    -  d    )       ℚ      d      \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})   .  The groups were first studied by  as a natural class of discrete subgroups of    P  S   L  2    (  ℂ  )       P  S   subscript  L  2   ℂ    PSL_{2}(\mathbb{C})   , now termed Kleinian groups .  As a subgroup of    P  S   L  2    (  ℂ  )       P  S   subscript  L  2   ℂ    PSL_{2}(\mathbb{C})   , a Bianchi group acts as orientation-preserving  isometries of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space     ℍ  3     superscript  ℍ  3    \mathbb{H}^{3}   . The quotient space     M  d   =    P  S   L  2    (   𝒪  d   )    \   ℍ  3         subscript  M  d    normal-\    P  S   subscript  L  2    subscript  𝒪  d     superscript  ℍ  3      M_{d}=PSL_{2}(\mathcal{O}_{d})\backslash\mathbb{H}^{3}   is a non-compact, hyperbolic 3-fold with finite volume, which is also called Bianchi manifold . An exact formula for the volume, in terms of the Dedekind zeta function of the base field    ℚ   (    -  d    )       ℚ      d      \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})   , was computed by Humbert as follows. Let   D   D   D   be the discriminant of    ℚ   (    -  d    )       ℚ      d      \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})   , and    Γ  =   S   L  2    (   𝒪  d   )        normal-Γ    S   subscript  L  2    subscript  𝒪  d      \Gamma=SL_{2}(\mathcal{O}_{d})   , the discontinuous action on   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   , then        v  o  l   (   Γ  \  ℍ   )    =      |  D  |    3  2     4   π  2      ζ   ℚ   (    -  d    )      (  2  )     .        v  o  l   normal-\  normal-Γ  ℍ         superscript    D     3  2      4   superscript  π  2      subscript  ζ    ℚ      d      2     vol(\Gamma\backslash\mathbb{H})=\frac{|D|^{\frac{3}{2}}}{4\pi^{2}}\zeta_{%
 \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})}(2)\ .     The set of cusps of    M  d     subscript  M  d    M_{d}   is in bijection with the class group of    ℚ   (    -  d    )       ℚ      d      \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})   . It is well known that any non-cocompact arithmetic Kleinian group is weakly commensurable with a Bianchi group. 1  References         External links   Allen Hatcher, Bianchi Orbifolds   "  Category:Group theory     Maclachlan & Reid (2003) p.58 ↩
