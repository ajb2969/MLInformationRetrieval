   Exponential dichotomy      Exponential dichotomy   In the mathematical theory of dynamical systems , an exponential dichotomy is a property of an equilibrium point that extends the idea of hyperbolicity to non- autonomous systems .  Definition  If       𝐱  ˙   =   A   (  t  )   𝐱        normal-˙  𝐱     A  t  𝐱     \dot{\mathbf{x}}=A(t)\mathbf{x}     is a linear non-autonomous dynamical system in R n with fundamental solution matrix Φ( t ), Φ(0) = I , then the equilibrium point 0 is said to have an exponential dichotomy if there exists a (constant) matrix  P such that P 2 = P and positive constants K , L , α, and β such that       ||   Φ   (  t  )   P   Φ   -  1     (  s  )    ||   ≤   K   e   -   α   (   t  -  s   )      for  s   ≤  t  <  ∞         norm    normal-Φ  t  P   superscript  normal-Φ    1    s      K   superscript  e      α    t  s      for  s        t           ||\Phi(t)P\Phi^{-1}(s)||\leq Ke^{-\alpha(t-s)}\mbox{ for }s\leq t<\infty     and        ||   Φ   (  t  )    (   I  -  P   )    Φ   -  1     (  s  )    ||   ≤   L   e   -   β   (   s  -  t   )      for  s   ≥  t  >   -  ∞    .         norm    normal-Φ  t    I  P    superscript  normal-Φ    1    s      L   superscript  e      β    s  t      for  s        t              ||\Phi(t)(I-P)\Phi^{-1}(s)||\leq Le^{-\beta(s-t)}\mbox{ for }s\geq t>-\infty.     If furthermore, L = 1/ K and β = α, then 0 is said to have a uniform exponential dichotomy .  The constants α and β allow us to define the spectral window of the equilibrium point, (−α, β).  Explanation  The matrix P is a projection onto the stable subspace and I − P is a projection onto the unstable subspace. What the exponential dichotomy says is that the norm of the projection onto the stable subspace of any orbit in the system decays exponentially as t → ∞ and the norm of the projection onto the unstable subspace of any orbit decays exponentially as t → −∞, and furthermore that the stable and unstable subspaces are conjugate (because     P  ⊕   (   I  -  P   )    =   ℝ  n        direct-sum  P    I  P     superscript  ℝ  n     \scriptstyle P\oplus(I-P)=\mathbb{R}^{n}   ).  An equilibrium point with an exponential dichotomy has many of the properties of a hyperbolic equilibrium point in autonomous systems . In fact, it can be shown that a hyperbolic point has an exponential dichotomy.  References     Coppel, W. A.
