   Constructible set (topology)      Constructible set (topology)    For a Gödel constructive set , see constructible universe .    In topology , a constructible set in a topological space is a finite union of locally closed sets . (A set is locally closed if it is the intersection of an open set and closed set, or equivalently, if it is open in its closure.) Constructible sets form a Boolean algebra (i.e., it is closed under finite union and complementation.) In fact, the constructible sets are precisely the Boolean algebra generated by open sets and closed sets; hence, the name "constructible". The notion appears in classical algebraic geometry .  Chevalley's theorem (EGA IV, 1.8.4.) states: Let    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   be a morphism of finite presentation of schemes. Then the image of any constructible set under f is constructible. In particular, the image of a variety need not be a variety, but is (under the assumptions) always a constructible set. For example, the map     𝐀  2   →   𝐀  2      normal-→   superscript  𝐀  2    superscript  𝐀  2     \mathbf{A}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbf{A}^{2}   that sends    (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,y)   to    (  x  ,   x  y   )     x    x  y     (x,xy)   has image the set     {  x  ≠  0  }   ∪   {  x  =  y  =  0  }      fragments   fragments  normal-{  x   0  normal-}     fragments  normal-{  x   y   0  normal-}     \{x\neq 0\}\cup\{x=y=0\}   , which is not a variety, but is constructible.  In a topological space, every constructible set contains a dense open subset of its closure. 1  See also   Constructible topology  Constructible sheaf   Notes  References   Allouche, Jean Paul.
