Induced metric

In mathematics and theoretical physics, the induced metric is the metric tensor defined on a submanifold which is calculated from the metric tensor on a larger manifold into which the submanifold is embedded. It may be calculated using the following formula (written using Einstein summation convention):



Here 
 
 
 
  describe the indices of coordinates 
 
 
 
  of the submanifold while the functions 
 
 
 
  encode the embedding into the higher-dimensional manifold whose tangent indices are denoted 
 
 
 
 .
Example - Curve on a torus
Let



be a map from the domain of the curve 
 
 
 
  with parameter 
 
 
 
  into the euclidean manifold 
 
 
 
 . Here 
 
 
 
  are constants.
Then there is a metric given on 
 
 
 
 
  as


 
 .
and we compute



Therefore
