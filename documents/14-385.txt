   Regenerative process      Regenerative process   In applied probability , a regenerative process is a class of stochastic process with the property that certain portions of the process can be treated as being statistically independent of each other. 1 This property can be used in the derivation of theoretical properties of such processes.  History  Regenerative processes were first defined by Walter L. Smith in Proceedings of the Royal Society A in 1955. 2 3  Definition  A regenerative process is a stochastic process with time points at which, from a probabilistic point of view, the process restarts itself. 4 These time point may themselves be determined by the evolution of the process. That is to say, the process { X ( t ), t ≥ 0} is a regenerative process if there exist time points 0 ≤ T 0 1 2 k'' process { X ( T k + t ) : t ≥ 0}   has the same distribution as the post- T 0 process { X ( T 0 + t ) : t ≥ 0}  is independent of the pre- T k process { X ( t ) : 0 ≤ t k''}   for k ≥ 1. 5 Intuitively this means a regenerative process can be split into i.i.d. cycles. 6  When T 0 = 0, X ( t ) is called a nondelayed regenerative process . Else, the process is called a delayed regenerative process . 7  Examples   Renewal processes are regenerative processes, with T 1 being the first renewal. 8  Alternating renewal processes , where a system alternates between an 'on' state and an 'off' state. 9  A recurrent Markov chain is a regenerative process, with T 1 being the time of first recurrence. 10 This includes Harris chains .  Reflected Brownian motion is a regenerative process (where one measures the time it takes particles to leave and come back). 11   Properties   By the renewal reward theorem , with probability 1, 12            lim   t  →  ∞      1  t     ∫  0  t    X   (  s  )   d  s      =    𝔼   [  R  ]     𝔼   [  τ  ]      .        subscript    normal-→  t         1  t     superscript   subscript   0   t     X  s  d  s          𝔼   delimited-[]  R      𝔼   delimited-[]  τ       \lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{1}{t}\int_{0}^{t}X(s)ds=\frac{\mathbb{E}[R]}{\mathbb{E}%
 [\tau]}.         where   τ   τ   \tau   is the length of the first cycle and    R  =    ∫  0  τ    X   (  s  )   d  s        R    superscript   subscript   0   τ     X  s  d  s      R=\int_{0}^{\tau}X(s)ds   is the value over the first cycle.    A measurable function of a regenerative process is a regenerative process with the same regeneration time 13   References  "  Category:Stochastic processes     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩       Sigman, Karl (2009) Regenerative Processes , lecture notes ↩
