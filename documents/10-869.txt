   1,2-dihydrovomilenine reductase      1,2-dihydrovomilenine reductase   In enzymology , a 1,2-dihydrovomilenine reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   17-O-acetylnorajmaline + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1,2-dihydrovomilenine + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 17-O-acetylnorajmaline and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 1,2-dihydrovomilenine , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 17-O-acetylnorajmaline:NADP+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in indole and ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis .
