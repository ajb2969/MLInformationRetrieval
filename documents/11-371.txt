   Nucleotide diphosphatase      Nucleotide diphosphatase   In enzymology , a nucleotide diphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a dinucleotide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 mononucleotides   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dinucleotide and H 2 O , whereas its product is mononucleotide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dinucleotide nucleotidohydrolase . Other names in common use include nucleotide pyrophosphatase , and nucleotide-sugar pyrophosphatase . This enzyme participates in 5 metabolic pathways : purine metabolism , starch and sucrose metabolism , riboflavin metabolism , nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism , and pantothenate and coa biosynthesis .  Structural studies  , 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .  References        "  Category:EC 3.6.1  Category:Enzymes of known structure
