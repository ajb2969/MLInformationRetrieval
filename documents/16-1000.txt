   Master stability function      Master stability function   In mathematics, the master stability function is a tool used to analyse the stability of the synchronous state in a dynamical system consisting of many identical oscillators which are coupled together, such as the Kuramoto model .  The setting is as follows. Consider a system with   N   N   N   identical oscillators. Without the coupling, they evolve according to the same differential equation , say      x  ˙   i   =   f   (   x  i   )         subscript   normal-˙  x   i     f   subscript  x  i      \dot{x}_{i}=f(x_{i})   where    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   denotes the state of oscillator   i   i   i   . A synchronous state of the system of oscillators is where all the oscillators are in the same state.  The coupling is defined by a coupling strength   σ   σ   \sigma   , a matrix    A   i  j      subscript  A    i  j     A_{ij}   which describes how the oscillators are coupled together, and a function   g   g   g   of the state of a single oscillator. Including the coupling leads to the following equation:         x  ˙   i   =    f   (   x  i   )    +   σ    ∑   j  =  1   N     A   i  j    g   (   x  j   )        .       subscript   normal-˙  x   i       f   subscript  x  i      σ    superscript   subscript     j  1    N      subscript  A    i  j    g   subscript  x  j         \dot{x}_{i}=f(x_{i})+\sigma\sum_{j=1}^{N}A_{ij}g(x_{j}).   It is assumed that the row sums     ∑  j    A   i  j        subscript   j    subscript  A    i  j      \sum_{j}A_{ij}   vanish so that the manifold of synchronous states is neutrally stable.  The master stability function is now defined as the function which maps the complex number   z   z   z   to the greatest Lyapunov exponent of the equation        y  ˙   =    (    D  f   +   γ  D  g    )   y    .       normal-˙  y         D  f     γ  D  g    y     \dot{y}=(Df+\gamma Dg)y.   The synchronous state of the system of coupled oscillators is stable if the master stability function is negative at    σ   λ  k       σ   subscript  λ  k     \sigma\lambda_{k}   where    λ  k     subscript  λ  k    \lambda_{k}   ranges over the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix   A   A   A   .
