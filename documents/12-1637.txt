Lambert's problem

In celestial mechanics Lambert's problem is concerned with the determination of an orbit from two position vectors and the time of flight, solved by Johann Heinrich Lambert. It has important applications in the areas of rendezvous, targeting, guidance, and preliminary orbit determination.1 Suppose a body under the influence of a central gravitational force is observed to travel from point P1 on its conic trajectory, to a point P2 in a time T. The time of flight is related to other variables by Lambert’s theorem, which states:

The transfer time of a body moving between two points on a conic trajectory is a function only of the sum of the distances of the two points from the origin of the force, the linear distance between the points, and the semimajor axis of the conic.2


Stated another way, Lambert's problem is the boundary value problem for the differential equation



of the two-body problem for which the Kepler orbit is the general solution.
The precise formulation of Lambert's problem is as follows:
Two different times 
 
 
 
  and two position vectors 
 
 
 
  are given.
Find the solution 
 
 
 
  satisfying the differential equation above for which

form a triangle in the plane defined by the vectors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as illustrated in figure 1. The distance between the points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , the distance between the points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  and the distance between the points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . The value 
 
 
 
  is positive or negative depending on which of the points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  that is furthest away from the point 
 
 
 
 . The geometrical problem to solve is to find all ellipses that go through the points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and have a focus at the point 
 
 

The points 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  define a hyperbola going through the point 
 
 
 
  with foci at the points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The point 
 
 
 
  is either on the left or on the right branch of the hyperbola depending on the sign of 
 
 
 
 . The semi-major axis of this hyperbola is 
 
 
 
  and the eccentricity 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . This hyperbola is illustrated in figure 2.
Relative the usual canonical coordinate system defined by the major and minor axis of the hyperbola its equation is



with



For any point on the same branch of the hyperbola as 
 
 
 
  the difference between the distances 
 
 
 
  to point 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to point 
 
 
 
  is



For any point 
 
 
 
  on the other branch of the hyperbola corresponding relation is



i.e.



But this means that the points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  both are on the ellipse having the focal points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and the semi-major axis



The ellipse corresponding to an arbitrary selected point 
 
 
 
  is displayed in figure 3.
Solution of Lambert's problem assuming an elliptic transfer orbit
First one separates the cases of having the orbital pole in the direction 
 
 
 
  or in the direction 
 
 
 
 . In the first case the transfer angle 
 
 
 
  for the first passage through 
 
 
 
  will be in the interval 
 
 
 
  and in the second case it will be in the interval 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  will continue to pass through 
 
 
 
  every orbital revolution.
In case 
 
 
 
  is zero, i.e. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have opposite directions, all orbital planes containing corresponding line are equally adequate and the transfer angle 
 
 
 
  for the first passage through 
 
 
 
  will be 
 
 
 
 .
For any 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  the triangle formed by 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are as in figure 1 with



and the semi-major axis (with sign!) of the hyperbola discussed above is



The eccentricity (with sign!) for the hyperbola is



and the semi-minor axis is


 
  The coordinates of the point 
 
 
 
  relative the canonical coordinate system for the hyperbola are (note that 
 
 
 
  has the sign of 
 
 
 
 )






where



Using the y-coordinate of the point 
 
 
 
  on the other branch of the hyperbola as free parameter the x-coordinate of 
 
 
 
  is (note that 
 
 
 
  has the sign of 
 
 
 
 )



The semi-major axis of the ellipse passing through the points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  having the foci 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is



The distance between the foci is



and the eccentricity is consequently



The true anomaly 
 
 
 
  at point 
 
 
 
  depends on the direction of motion, i.e. if 
 
 
 
  is positive or negative. In both cases one has that

  to 
 
 
 
  expressed in the canonical coordinates.
If 
 
 
 
  is positive then



If 
 
 
 
  is negative then

being known functions of the parameter y the time for the true anomaly to increase with the amount 
 
 
 
  is also a known function of y. If 
 
 
 
  is in the range that can be obtained with an elliptic Kepler orbit corresponding y value can then be found using an iterative algorithm.

  (or very close) 
 
 
 
  and the hyperbola with two branches deteriorates into one single line orthogonal to the line between 
 
 
 
  and

Numerical example
[[Image:Lambert Fig4.png|thumb|right|300px| Figure 4: The transfer time with

r1 = 10000 km
 
r2 = 16000 km
 
α = 120°
 

as a function of y when y varies from −20000 km to 50000 km. The transfer time decreases from 20741 seconds with y = −20000 km to 2856 seconds with y = 50000 km. For any value between 2856 seconds and 20741 seconds the Lambert's problem can be solved using an y-value between −20000 km and 50000 km ]]
Assume the following values for an Earth centred Kepler orbit

r1 = 10000 km
r2 = 16000 km
α = 100°

These are the numerical values that correspond to figures 1, 2, and 3.
Selecting the parameter y as 30000 km one gets a transfer time of 3072 seconds assuming the gravitational constant to be 
 
 
 
  = 398603 km3/s2. Corresponding orbital elements are

semi-major axis = 23001 km
eccentricity = 0.566613
true anomaly at time t1 = −7.577°
true anomaly at time t2 = 92.423°

This y-value corresponds to Figure 3.
With

r1 = 10000 km
r2 = 16000 km
α = 260°

one gets the same ellipse with the opposite direction of motion, i.e.

true anomaly at time t1 = 7.577°
true anomaly at time t2 = 267.577° = 360° − 92.423°

and a transfer time of 31645 seconds.
The radial and tangential velocity components can then be computed with the formulas (see the Kepler orbit article)






The transfer times from P1 to P2 for other values of y are displayed in Figure 4.
Practical applications
The most typical use of this algorithm to solve Lambert's problem is certainly for the design of interplanetary missions. A spacecraft traveling from the Earth to for example Mars can in first approximation be considered to follow a heliocentric elliptic Kepler orbit from the position of the Earth at the time of launch to the position of Mars at the time of arrival. By comparing the initial and the final velocity vector of this heliocentric Kepler orbit with corresponding velocity vectors for the Earth and Mars a quite good estimate of the required launch energy and of the maneuvres needed for the capture at Mars can be obtained. This approach is often used in conjunction with the Patched Conic Approximation. This is also a method for Orbit determination. If two positions of a spacecraft at different times are known with good precision from for example a GPS fix the complete orbit can be derived with this algorithm, i.e. an interpolation and an extrapolation of these two position fixes is obtained.
