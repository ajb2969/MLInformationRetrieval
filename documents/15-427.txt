Hardy–Littlewood inequality

In mathematical analysis, the Hardy–Littlewood inequality, named after G. H. Hardy and John Edensor Littlewood, states that if f and g are nonnegative measurable real functions vanishing at infinity that are defined on n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn then



where f* and g* are the symmetric decreasing rearrangements of f(x) and g(x), respectively.12
Proof
From layer cake representation we have:34






where 
 
 
 
 
  denotes the indicator function of the subset Ef given by



Analogously, 
 
 
 
  denotes the indicator function of the subset Eg given by
