Componendo and dividendo

In algebra, componendo and dividendo (or componendo et dividendo) is a method of simplification of equations implying fractions. It states that1 2


Adding 1 to both sides of the main equation gives:
Subtracting 1 from both sides of the main equation gives:
Dividing equation 3 by equation 4, we have:
Dividing equation 4 by equation 3, we have
Relationship  above is called invertendo.
Relationship  above is called alternendo.
Relationship  above is called componendo.
Relationship  above is called dividendo.
Relationship  above is called componendo and dividendo.
Relationship  above is called dividendo and componendo.
Comment on the proof
We can similarly deduce the much more general fact that the value of any fraction



in which 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are nonzero and can be expressed in terms of the values of



and the value of 
 
 
 
 , and so depends only on the values of those 2n + 1 fractions:



The original result is essentially a special case of this fact, because



can be regarded as a fraction of the above form.
Example
This method can be used in various situations.
For instance :



Find the value of x.
Solution :
Applying componendo and dividendo,
