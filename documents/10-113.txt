   Local flatness      Local flatness   In topology , a branch of mathematics , local flatness is a property of a submanifold in a topological manifold of larger dimension . In the category of topological manifolds, locally flat submanifolds play a role similar to that of embedded submanifolds in the category of smooth manifolds .  Suppose a d dimensional manifold N is embedded into an n dimensional manifold M (where d x \in N, we say N is locally flat at x if there is a neighborhood    U  ⊂  M      U  M    U\subset M   of x such that the topological pair     (  U  ,   U  ∩  N   )     U    U  N     (U,U\cap N)   is homeomorphic to the pair    (   ℝ  n   ,   ℝ  d   )      superscript  ℝ  n    superscript  ℝ  d     (\mathbb{R}^{n},\mathbb{R}^{d})   , with a standard inclusion of    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   as a subspace of    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   . That is, there exists a homeomorphism    U  →   R  n      normal-→  U   superscript  R  n     U\to R^{n}   such that the image of    U  ∩  N      U  N    U\cap N   coincides with    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   .  The above definition assumes that, if M has a boundary , x is not a boundary point of M . If x is a point on the boundary of M then the definition is modified as follows. We say that N is locally flat at a boundary point x of M if there is a neighborhood    U  ⊂  M      U  M    U\subset M   of x such that the topological pair    (  U  ,   U  ∩  N   )     U    U  N     (U,U\cap N)   is homeomorphic to the pair    (   ℝ  +  n   ,   ℝ  d   )      subscript   superscript  ℝ  n      superscript  ℝ  d     (\mathbb{R}^{n}_{+},\mathbb{R}^{d})   , where    ℝ  +  n     subscript   superscript  ℝ  n      \mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}   is a standard half-space and    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   is included as a standard subspace of its boundary. In more detail, we can set     ℝ  +  n   =   {   y  ∈   ℝ  n    :    y  n   ≥  0   }        subscript   superscript  ℝ  n      conditional-set    y   superscript  ℝ  n       subscript  y  n   0      \mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}=\{y\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\colon y_{n}\geq 0\}   and     ℝ  d   =   {   y  ∈   ℝ  n    :    y   d  +  1    =  ⋯  =   y  n   =  0   }        superscript  ℝ  d    conditional-set    y   superscript  ℝ  n         subscript  y    d  1    normal-⋯        subscript  y  n        0       \mathbb{R}^{d}=\{y\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\colon y_{d+1}=\cdots=y_{n}=0\}   .  We call N  locally flat in M if N is locally flat at every point. Similarly, a map    χ  :   N  →  M      normal-:  χ   normal-→  N  M     \chi\colon N\to M   is called locally flat , even if it is not an embedding, if every x in N has a neighborhood U whose image    χ   (  U  )       χ  U    \chi(U)   is locally flat in M .  Local flatness of an embedding implies strong properties not shared by all embeddings. Brown (1962) proved that if d = n − 1, then N is collared ; that is, it has a neighborhood which is homeomorphic to N × [0,1] with N itself corresponding to N × 1/2 (if N is in the interior of M ) or N × 0 (if N is in the boundary of M ).
