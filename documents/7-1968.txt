Ellipsoidal coordinates

Ellipsoidal coordinates are a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system

 
  that generalizes the two-dimensional elliptic coordinate system. Unlike most three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate systems that feature quadratic coordinate surfaces, the ellipsoidal coordinate system is not produced by rotating or projecting any two-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system.
Basic formulae
The Cartesian coordinates 
 
 
 
  can be produced from the ellipsoidal coordinates 
 
 
 
  by the equations









where the following limits apply to the coordinates



Consequently, surfaces of constant 
 
 
 
  are ellipsoids



whereas surfaces of constant 
 
 
 
  are hyperboloids of one sheet



because the last term in the lhs is negative, and surfaces of constant 
 
 
 
  are hyperboloids of two sheets



because the last two terms in the lhs are negative.
Scale factors and differential operators
For brevity in the equations below, we introduce a function



where 
 
 
 
  can represent any of the three variables 
 
 
 
 . Using this function, the scale factors can be written









Hence, the infinitesimal volume element equals



and the Laplacian is defined by









\frac{4\sqrt{S(\mu)}}{\left( \mu - \lambda \right) \left( \mu - \nu\right)} \frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} \left[ \sqrt{S(\mu)} \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \mu} \right] \ + \ \frac{4\sqrt{S(\nu)}}{\left( \nu - \lambda \right) \left( \nu - \mu\right)} \frac{\partial}{\partial \nu} \left[ \sqrt{S(\nu)} \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \nu} \right] 
Other differential operators such as 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  can be expressed in the coordinates 
 
 
 
  by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates.
