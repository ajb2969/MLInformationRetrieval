   Dirac operator      Dirac operator   In mathematics and quantum mechanics , a Dirac operator is a differential operator that is a formal square root, or half-iterate , of a second-order operator such as a Laplacian . The original case which concerned Paul Dirac was to factorise formally an operator for Minkowski space , to get a form of quantum theory compatible with special relativity ; to get the relevant Laplacian as a product of first-order operators he introduced spinors .  Formal definition  In general, let D be a first-order differential operator acting on a vector bundle  V over a Riemannian manifold  M . If        D  2   =  Δ   ,       superscript  D  2   normal-Δ    D^{2}=\Delta,\,   where ∆ is the Laplacian of V , then D is called a Dirac operator .  In high-energy physics , this requirement is often relaxed: only the second-order part of D 2 must equal the Laplacian.  Examples  Example 1:  D=-i ∂ x is a Dirac operator on the tangent bundle over a line.  Example 2: We now consider a simple bundle of importance in physics: The configuration space of a particle with spin ½ confined to a plane, which is also the base manifold. It's represented by a wavefunction ψ: R 2 → C 2         ψ   (  x  ,  y  )    =   [      χ   (  x  ,  y  )         η   (  x  ,  y  )       ]         ψ   x  y        χ   x  y        η   x  y        \psi(x,y)=\begin{bmatrix}\chi(x,y)\\
 \eta(x,y)\end{bmatrix}        where x and y are the usual coordinate functions on R 2 . χ specifies the probability amplitude for the particle to be in the spin-up state, and similarly for η. The so-called spin-Dirac operator can then be written         D  =    -   i   σ  x    ∂  x     -   i   σ  y    ∂  y      ,      D        i   subscript  σ  x    subscript   x       i   subscript  σ  y    subscript   y       D=-i\sigma_{x}\partial_{x}-i\sigma_{y}\partial_{y},\,        where σ i are the Pauli matrices . Note that the anticommutation relations for the Pauli matrices make the proof of the above defining property trivial. Those relations define the notion of a Clifford algebra .  Solutions to the Dirac equation for spinor fields are often called harmonic spinors 1 .  Example 3: The most famous Dirac operator describes the propagation of a free fermion in three dimensions and is elegantly written        D  =   γ  μ     ∂  μ    ≡  ∂  /  ,     fragments  D    superscript  γ  μ    subscript   μ      normal-,    D=\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\ \equiv\partial\!\!\!/,        using the Feynman slash notation .  Example 4: There is also the Dirac operator arising in Clifford analysis . In euclidean n -space this is        D  =    ∑   j  =  1   n     e  j    ∂   ∂   x  j           D    superscript   subscript     j  1    n      subscript  e  j         subscript  x  j         D=\sum_{j=1}^{n}e_{j}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{j}}        where { e j : j = 1, ..., n } is an orthonormal basis for euclidean n-space, and R n is considered to be embedded in a Clifford algebra .  This is a special case of the Atiyah-Singer-Dirac operator acting on sections of a spinor bundle .  Example 5: For a spin manifold , M , the Atiyah-Singer-Dirac operator is locally defined as follows: For x ∈ M and e 1 ( x ), ..., e j ( x ) a local orthonormal basis for the tangent space of M at x, the Atiyah-Singer-Dirac operator is         ∑   j  =  1   n     e  j    (  x  )     Γ  ~     e  j    (  x  )          superscript   subscript     j  1    n      subscript  e  j   x   subscript   normal-~  normal-Γ      subscript  e  j   x       \sum_{j=1}^{n}e_{j}(x)\tilde{\Gamma}_{e_{j}(x)}   ,     where    Γ  ~     normal-~  normal-Γ    \tilde{\Gamma}   is a lifting of the Levi-Civita connection on M to the spinor bundle over M .  Generalisations  In Clifford analysis, the operator D : C ∞ ( R k ⊗ R n , S ) → C ∞ ( R k ⊗ R n , C k ⊗ S ) acting on spinor valued functions defined by       f   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  k   )    ↦   (       ∂    x  1   ¯    f         ∂    x  2   ¯    f       …        ∂    x  k   ¯    f      )      maps-to    f    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  k         subscript    normal-¯   subscript  x  1     f       subscript    normal-¯   subscript  x  2     f     normal-…      subscript    normal-¯   subscript  x  k     f       f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{k})\mapsto\begin{pmatrix}\partial_{\underline{x_{1}}}f\\
 \partial_{\underline{x_{2}}}f\\
 \ldots\\
 \partial_{\underline{x_{k}}}f\\
 \end{pmatrix}   is sometimes called Dirac operator in k Clifford variables. In the notation, S is the space of spinors,     x  i   =   (   x   i  1    ,   x   i  2    ,  …  ,   x   i  n    )        subscript  x  i     subscript  x    i  1     subscript  x    i  2    normal-…   subscript  x    i  n       x_{i}=(x_{i1},x_{i2},\ldots,x_{in})   are n -dimensional variables and     ∂    x  i   ¯    =    ∑  j     e  j   ⋅   ∂   x   i  j            subscript    normal-¯   subscript  x  i       subscript   j    normal-⋅   subscript  e  j    subscript    subscript  x    i  j         \partial_{\underline{x_{i}}}=\sum_{j}e_{j}\cdot\partial_{x_{ij}}   is the Dirac operator in the i -th variable. This is a common generalization of the Dirac operator ( k=1 ) and the Dolbeault operator ( n=2 , k arbitrary). It is an invariant differential operator , invariant under the action of the group SL( k ) × Spin( n ). The resolution of D is known only in some special cases.
