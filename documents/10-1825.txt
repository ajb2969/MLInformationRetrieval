   Biotin synthase      Biotin synthase   In enzymology , a biotin synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dethiobiotin + sulfur + 2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   biotin + 2 L-methionine + 2 5'-deoxyadenosine   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are dethiobiotin , sulfur , and S-adenosyl-L-methionine , whereas its 3 products are biotin , L-methionine , and 5'-deoxyadenosine .  This radical SAM enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfurtransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dethiobiotin:sulfur sulfurtransferase . This enzyme participates in biotin metabolism . It employs one cofactor , iron-sulfur .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
