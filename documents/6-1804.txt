Intermediate Jacobian

In mathematics, the intermediate Jacobian of a compact Kähler manifold or Hodge structure is a complex torus that is a common generalization of the Jacobian variety of a curve and the Picard variety and the Albanese variety. It is obtained by putting a complex structure on the torus Hn(M,R)/Hn(M,Z) for n odd. There are several different natural ways to put a complex structure on this torus, giving several different sorts of intermediate Jacobians, including one due to  and one due to . The ones constructed by Weil have natural polarizations if M is projective, and so are abelian varieties, while the ones constructed by Griffiths behave well under holomorphic deformations.
A complex structure on a real vector space is given by an automorphism I with square −1. The complex structures on Hn(M,R) are defined using the Hodge decomposition



On Hp,q the Weil complex structure IW is multiplication by ip−q, while the Griffiths complex structure IG is multiplication by i if p > q and −i if p n(M,R) into itself and so defined complex structures on it.
For n = 1 the intermediate Jacobian is the Picard variety, and for n = 2 dim(M) − 1 it is the Albanese variety. In these two extreme cases the constructions of Weil and Griffiths are equivalent.
used intermediate Jacobians to show that non-singular cubic threefolds are not rational, even though they are unirational.
