   Intermediate Jacobian      Intermediate Jacobian   In mathematics, the intermediate Jacobian of a compact Kähler manifold or Hodge structure is a complex torus that is a common generalization of the Jacobian variety of a curve and the Picard variety and the Albanese variety . It is obtained by putting a complex structure on the torus H n (M, R )/ H n (M, Z ) for n odd. There are several different natural ways to put a complex structure on this torus, giving several different sorts of intermediate Jacobians, including one due to  and one due to . The ones constructed by Weil have natural polarizations if M is projective, and so are abelian varieties, while the ones constructed by Griffiths behave well under holomorphic deformations .  A complex structure on a real vector space is given by an automorphism I with square −1. The complex structures on H n (M, R ) are defined using the Hodge decomposition          H  n    (  M  ,  R  )    ⊗  C   =     H   n  ,  0     (  M  )    ⊕  ⋯  ⊕    H   0  ,  n     (  M  )      .       tensor-product     superscript  H  n    M  R    C    direct-sum     superscript  H   n  0    M   normal-⋯     superscript  H   0  n    M      H^{n}(M,{R})\otimes{C}=H^{n,0}(M)\oplus\cdots\oplus H^{0,n}(M).\,     On H p , q the Weil complex structure I W is multiplication by i p − q , while the Griffiths complex structure I G is multiplication by i if p > q and − i if p  n (M, R ) into itself and so defined complex structures on it.  For n = 1 the intermediate Jacobian is the Picard variety , and for n = 2 dim( M ) − 1 it is the Albanese variety . In these two extreme cases the constructions of Weil and Griffiths are equivalent.  used intermediate Jacobians to show that non-singular cubic threefolds are not rational , even though they are unirational .
