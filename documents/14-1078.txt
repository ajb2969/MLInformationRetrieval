  |- !Orthogonal projections in BC7 Coxeter plane |} In seven-dimensional geometry, a rectified 7-cube is a convex uniform 7-polytope, being a rectification of the regular 7-cube.
There are unique 7 degrees of rectifications, the zeroth being the 7-cube, and the 6th and last being the 7-cube. Vertices of the rectified 7-cube are located at the edge-centers of the 7-ocube. Vertices of the birectified 7-cube are located in the square face centers of the 7-cube. Vertices of the trirectified 7-cube are located in the cube cell centers of the 7-cube.
