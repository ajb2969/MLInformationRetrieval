  is the standard normal probability density function,


 
  is the corresponding cumulative distribution function (where erf is the error function) and


 
  which is known as the Owen's T function.
Owen 1 has an extensive list of Gaussian-type integrals; only a subset is given below.
Indefinite integrals

In these integrals, n!! is the double factorial: for even n’s it is equal to the product of all even numbers from 2 to n, and for odd n’s it is the product of all odd numbers from 1 to n, additionally it is assumed that .
