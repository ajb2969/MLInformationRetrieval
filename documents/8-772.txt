   Spatial descriptive statistics      Spatial descriptive statistics   Spatial descriptive statistics are used for a variety of purposes in geography, particularly in quantitative data analyses involving Geographic Information Systems (GIS) .  Types of spatial data  The simplest forms of spatial data are gridded data , in which a scalar quantity is measured for each point in a regular grid of points, and point sets , in which a set of coordinates (e.g. of points in the plane) is observed. An example of gridded data would be a satellite image of forest density that has been digitized on a grid. An example of a point set would be the latitude/longitude coordinates of all elm trees in a particular plot of land. More complicated forms of data include marked point sets and spatial time series.  Measures of spatial central tendency  The coordinate-wise mean of a point set is the centroid , which solves the same variational problem in the plane (or higher-dimensional Euclidean space) that the familiar average solves on the real line — that is, the centroid has the smallest possible average squared distance to all points in the set.  Measures of spatial dispersion  Dispersion captures the degree to which points in a point set are separated from each other. For most applications, spatial dispersion should be quantified in a way that is invariant to rotations and reflections. Several simple measures of spatial dispersion for a point set can be defined using the covariance matrix of the coordinates of the points. The trace , the determinant , and the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix can be used as measures of spatial dispersion.  A measure of spatial dispersion that is not based on the covariance matrix is the average distance between nearest neighbors. 1  Measures of spatial autocorrelation  See the spatial autocorrelation section from Wikipedia's spatial analysis page.  Measures of spatial homogeneity  A homogeneous set of points in the plane is a set that is distributed such that approximately the same number of points occurs in any circular region of a given area. A set of points that lacks homogeneity is spatially clustered . A simple probability model for spatially homogeneous points is the Poisson process in the plane with constant intensity function.  Ripley's K and L functions  Ripley's K and L functions 2 are closely related descriptive statistics for detecting deviations from spatial homogeneity. The K function (technically its sample-based estimate) is defined as         L  ^    (  t  )    =    (     K  ^    (  t  )    /  π   )    1  /  2     .         normal-^  L   t    superscript       normal-^  K   t   π     1  2      \hat{L}(t)=\Big(\hat{K}(t)/\pi\Big)^{1/2}.   should be approximately equal to π s 2 .  For data analysis, the variance stabilized Ripley K function called the L function is generally used. The sample version of the L function is defined as      t  -    L  ^    (  t  )        t     normal-^  L   t     t-\hat{L}(t)     For approximately homogeneous data, the L function has expected value t and its variance is approximately constant in t . A common plot is a graph of $t - \hat{L}(t)$ against t , which will approximately follow the horizontal zero-axis with constant dispersion if the data follow a homogeneous Poisson process.
