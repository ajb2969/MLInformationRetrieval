   Bernstein's theorem (approximation theory)      Bernstein's theorem (approximation theory)   In approximation theory , Bernstein's theorem is a converse to Jackson's theorem . 1 The first results of this type were proved by Sergei Bernstein in 1912. 2  For approximation by trigonometric polynomials , the result is as follows:  Let f : [0, 2π] → C be a 2 π - periodic function , and assume r is a natural number, and 0  0 and a sequence of trigonometric polynomials { P n } n ≥ n 0 such that          deg    P  n    =   n    ,     sup   0  ≤  x  ≤   2  π      |    f   (  x  )    -    P  n    (  x  )     |    ≤     C   (  f  )     n   r  +  α        ,     formulae-sequence     degree   subscript  P  n    n       subscript  supremum      0  x         2  π            f  x      subscript  P  n   x          C  f    superscript  n    r  α        \deg\,P_{n}=n~{},\quad\sup_{0\leq x\leq 2\pi}|f(x)-P_{n}(x)|\leq\frac{C(f)}{n^%
