Bernstein's theorem (approximation theory)

In approximation theory, Bernstein's theorem is a converse to Jackson's theorem.1 The first results of this type were proved by Sergei Bernstein in 1912.2
For approximation by trigonometric polynomials, the result is as follows:
Let f: [0, 2π] → C be a 2π-periodic function, and assume r is a natural number, and 0  0 and a sequence of trigonometric polynomials {Pn}n ≥ n0 such that


 
  then f = Pn0 + φ, where φ has a bounded r-th derivative which is α-Hölder continuous.
