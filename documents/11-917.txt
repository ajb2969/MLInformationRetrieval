Glutamine N-phenylacetyltransferase




Glutamine N-phenylacetyltransferase

In enzymology, a glutamine N-phenylacetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

phenylacetyl-CoA + L-glutamine 
 
 
 
  CoA + alpha-N-phenylacetyl-L-glutamine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phenylacetyl-CoA and L-glutamine, whereas its two products are CoA and alpha-N-phenylacetyl-L-glutamine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phenylacetyl-CoA:L-glutamine alpha-N-phenylacetyltransferase. Other names in common use include glutamine phenylacetyltransferase, and phenylacetyl-CoA:L-glutamine N-acetyltransferase. This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism and phenylalanine metabolism.
