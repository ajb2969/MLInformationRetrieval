   Regulated function      Regulated function   In mathematics , a regulated function (or ruled function ) is a "well-behaved" function of a single real variable. Regulated functions arise as a class of integrable functions , and have several equivalent characterisations. Regulated functions were introduced by Georg Aumann in 1954; the corresponding regulated integral was promoted by the Bourbaki group, including Jean Dieudonné .  Definition  Let X be a Banach space with norm || - || X . A function f : [0, T ] → X is said to be a regulated function if one (and hence both) of the following two equivalent conditions holds true :   for every t in the interval [0, T ], both the left and right limits  f ( t −) and f ( t +) exist in X (apart from, obviously, f (0−) and f ( T +));    there exists a sequence of step functions  φ n : [0, T ] → X  converging uniformly to f (i.e. with respect to the supremum norm || - || ∞ ).   It requires a little work to show that these two conditions are equivalent. However, it is relatively easy to see that the second condition may be re-stated in the following equivalent ways:   for every δ > 0, there is some step function φ δ : [0, T ] → X such that            ∥   f  -   φ  δ    ∥   ∞   =    sup   t  ∈   [  0  ,  T  ]       ∥    f   (  t  )    -    φ  δ    (  t  )     ∥   X    <  δ   ;         subscript   norm    f   subscript  φ  δ         subscript  supremum    t   0  T      subscript   norm      f  t      subscript  φ  δ   t     X         δ     \|f-\varphi_{\delta}\|_{\infty}=\sup_{t\in[0,T]}\|f(t)-\varphi_{\delta}(t)\|_{%
 X}<\delta;         f lies in the closure of the space Step([0, T ]; X ) of all step functions from [0, T ] into X (taking closure with respect to the supremum norm in the space B([0, T ]; X ) of all bounded functions from [0, T ] into X ).   Properties of regulated functions  Let Reg([0, T ]; X ) denote the set of all regulated functions f : [0, T ] → X .   Sums and scalar multiples of regulated functions are again regulated functions. In other words, Reg([0, T ]; X ) is a vector space over the same field  K as the space X ; typically, K will be the real or complex numbers . If X is equipped with an operation of multiplication, then products of regulated functions are again regulated functions. In other words, if X is a K - algebra , then so is Reg([0, T ]; X ).    The supremum norm is a norm on Reg([0, T ]; X ), and Reg([0, T ]; X ) is a topological vector space with respect to the topology induced by the supremum norm.    As noted above, Reg([0, T ]; X ) is the closure in B([0, T ]; X ) of Step([0, T ]; X ) with respect to the supremum norm.    If X is a Banach space , then Reg([0, T ]; X ) is also a Banach space with respect to the supremum norm.    Reg([0, T ]; R ) forms an infinite-dimensional real Banach algebra : finite linear combinations and products of regulated functions are again regulated functions.    Since a continuous function defined on a compact space (such as [0, T ]) is automatically uniformly continuous , every continuous function f : [0, T ] → X is also regulated. In fact, with respect to the supremum norm, the space C 0 ([0, T ]; X ) of continuous functions is a closed  linear subspace of Reg([0, T ]; X ).    If X is a Banach space , then the space BV([0, T ]; X ) of functions of bounded variation forms a dense linear subspace of Reg([0, T ]; X ):         Reg   (   [  0  ,  T  ]   ;  X  )   =    BV   (   [  0  ,  T  ]   ;  X  )    ¯   w.r.t.  ∥  ⋅   ∥  ∞   .     fragments  Reg   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-[  0  normal-,  T  normal-]   normal-;  X  normal-)     normal-¯    BV    0  T   X     w.r.t.  parallel-to  normal-⋅   subscript  parallel-to    normal-.    \mathrm{Reg}([0,T];X)=\overline{\mathrm{BV}([0,T];X)}\mbox{ w.r.t. }\|\cdot\|_%
 {\infty}.         If X is a Banach space, then a function f : [0, T ] → X is regulated if and only if it is of bounded φ -variation for some φ :           Reg   (   [  0  ,  T  ]   ;  X  )    =    ⋃  φ     BV  φ    (   [  0  ,  T  ]   ;  X  )      .        Reg    0  T   X      subscript   φ      subscript  BV  φ     0  T   X       \mathrm{Reg}([0,T];X)=\bigcup_{\varphi}\mathrm{BV}_{\varphi}([0,T];X).         If X is a separable  Hilbert space , then Reg([0, T ]; X ) satisfies a compactness theorem known as the Fraňková-Helly selection theorem .    The set of discontinuities of a regulated function is countable : to see this it is sufficient to note that given    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   , the set of points at which the right and left limits differ by more than   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   is finite. In particular, the discontinuity set has measure zero , from which it follows that a regulated function has a well-defined Riemann integral .    The integral, as defined on step functions in the obvious way, extends naturally to Reg([0, T ]; X ) by defining the integral of a regulated function to be the limit of the integrals of any sequence of step functions converging uniformly to it. This extension is well-defined and satisfies all of the usual properties of an integral. In particular, the regulated integral   is a bounded linear function from Reg([0, T ]; X ) to X ; hence, in the case X = R , the integral is an element of the space that is dual to Reg([0, T ]; R );  agrees with the Riemann integral .
