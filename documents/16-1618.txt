   Buchstab function      Buchstab function   The Buchstab function (or Buchstab's function ) is the unique continuous function    ω  :     \R     ≥  1    →    \R     >  0        normal-:  ω   normal-→   subscript  \R    absent  1     subscript  \R    absent  0       \omega:\R_{\geq 1}\rightarrow\R_{>0}   defined by the delay differential equation         ω   (  u  )    =   1  u    ,   1  ≤  u  ≤  2    ,     formulae-sequence      ω  u     1  u        1  u       2      \omega(u)=\frac{1}{u},\qquad\qquad\qquad 1\leq u\leq 2,            d   d  u     (   u  ω   (  u  )    )    =   ω   (   u  -  1   )     ,   u  ≥  2.      formulae-sequence        d    d  u      u  ω  u      ω    u  1       u  2.     {\frac{d}{du}}(u\omega(u))=\omega(u-1),\qquad u\geq 2.   In the second equation, the derivative at u = 2 should be taken as u approaches 2 from the right. It is named after Alexander Buchstab , who wrote about it in 1937.  Asymptotics  The Buchstab function approaches    e   -  γ      superscript  e    γ     e^{-\gamma}   rapidly as     u  →  ∞   ,     normal-→  u     u\to\infty,   where   γ   γ   \gamma   is the Euler–Mascheroni constant . In fact,         |    ω   (  u  )    -   e   -  γ     |   ≤    ρ   (   u  -  1   )    u    ,   u  ≥  1    ,     formulae-sequence          ω  u    superscript  e    γ          ρ    u  1    u      u  1     |\omega(u)-e^{-\gamma}|\leq\frac{\rho(u-1)}{u},\qquad u\geq 1,     where ρ is the Dickman function . 1 Also,     ω   (  u  )    -   e   -  γ          ω  u    superscript  e    γ      \omega(u)-e^{-\gamma}   oscillates in a regular way, alternating between extrema and zeroes; the extrema alternate between positive maxima and negative minima. The interval between consecutive extrema approaches 1 as u approaches infinity, as does the interval between consecutive zeroes. 2  Applications  The Buchstab function is used to count rough numbers . If Φ( x , y ) is the number of positive integers less than or equal to x with no prime factor less than y , then for any fixed u > 1,         Φ   (  x  ,   x   1  /  u    )    ∼   ω   (  u  )    x   log   x   1  /  u        ,   x  →  ∞    .     formulae-sequence   similar-to    normal-Φ   x   superscript  x    1  u        ω  u    x     superscript  x    1  u         normal-→  x      \Phi(x,x^{1/u})\sim\omega(u)\frac{x}{\log x^{1/u}},\qquad x\to\infty.
