   Centralizer and normalizer      Centralizer and normalizer   In mathematics, especially group theory , the centralizer (also called commutant 1 2 ) of a subset  S of a group  G is the set of elements of G that commute with each element of S , and the normalizer of S is the set of elements of G that commute with S "as a whole". The centralizer and normalizer of S are subgroups of G , and can provide insight into the structure of G .  The definitions also apply to monoids and semigroups .  In ring theory , the centralizer of a subset of a ring is defined with respect to the semigroup (multiplication) operation of the ring. The centralizer of a subset of a ring R is a subring of R . This article also deals with centralizers and normalizers in Lie algebra .  The idealizer in a semigroup or ring is another construction that is in the same vein as the centralizer and normalizer.  Definitions   Groups and semigroups   The centralizer of a subset S of group (or semigroup) G is defined to be 3        C  G    (  S  )    =   {   g  ∈  G   ∣    s  g   =   g  s  for all  s   ∈  S   }          subscript  normal-C  G   S    conditional-set    g  G         s  g     g  s  for all  s        S       \mathrm{C}_{G}(S)=\{g\in G\mid sg=gs\text{ for all }s\in S\}     Sometimes if there is no ambiguity about the group in question, the G is suppressed from the notation entirely. When S ={ a } is a singleton set, then C G ({ a }) can be abbreviated to C G ( a ). Another less common notation for the centralizer is Z( a ), which parallels the notation for the center of a group . With this latter notation, one must be careful to avoid confusion between the center of a group G , Z( G ), and the centralizer of an element  g in G , given by Z( g ).  The normalizer of S in the group (or semigroup) G is defined to be        N  G    (  S  )    =   {   g  ∈  G   ∣    g  S   =   S  g    }          subscript  normal-N  G   S    conditional-set    g  G       g  S     S  g       \mathrm{N}_{G}(S)=\{g\in G\mid gS=Sg\}     The definitions are similar but not identical. If g is in the centralizer of S and s is in S , then it must be that , however if g is in the normalizer,  for some t in S , potentially different from s . The same conventions mentioned previously about suppressing G and suppressing braces from singleton sets also apply to the normalizer notation. The normalizer should not be confused with the normal closure .   Rings, algebras, Lie rings and Lie algebras   If R is a ring or an algebra, and S is a subset of the ring, then the centralizer of S is exactly as defined for groups, with R in the place of G .  If   𝔏   𝔏   \mathfrak{L}   is a Lie algebra (or Lie ring ) with Lie product [ x , y ], then the centralizer of a subset S of   𝔏   𝔏   \mathfrak{L}   is defined to be        C  𝔏    (  S  )    =   {   x  ∈  𝔏   ∣    [  x  ,  s  ]   =   0  for all  s   ∈  S   }          subscript  normal-C  𝔏   S    conditional-set    x  𝔏        x  s     0  for all  s        S       \mathrm{C}_{\mathfrak{L}}(S)=\{x\in\mathfrak{L}\mid[x,s]=0\text{ for all }s\in
 S\}   The definition of centralizers for Lie rings is linked to the definition for rings in the following way. If R is an associative ring, then R can be given the bracket product . Of course then  if and only if . If we denote the set R with the bracket product as L R , then clearly the ring centralizer of S in R is equal to the Lie ring centralizer of S in L R .  The normalizer of a subset S of a Lie algebra (or Lie ring)   𝔏   𝔏   \mathfrak{L}   is given by        N  𝔏    (  S  )    =   {   x  ∈  𝔏   ∣    [  x  ,  s  ]   ∈   S  for all  s   ∈  S   }          subscript  normal-N  𝔏   S    conditional-set    x  𝔏        x  s     S  for all  s        S       \mathrm{N}_{\mathfrak{L}}(S)=\{x\in\mathfrak{L}\mid[x,s]\in S\text{ for all }s%
 \in S\}   While this is the standard usage of the term "normalizer" in Lie algebra, it should be noted that this construction is actually the idealizer of the set S in   𝔏   𝔏   \mathfrak{L}   . If S is an additive subgroup of   𝔏   𝔏   \mathfrak{L}   , then     N  𝔏    (  S  )        subscript  normal-N  𝔏   S    \mathrm{N}_{\mathfrak{L}}(S)   is the largest Lie subring (or Lie subalgebra, as the case may be) in which S is a Lie ideal .  Properties  Semigroups  Let S ′ be the centralizer, i.e.      S  ′   =   {   x  ∈  A   :    s  x   =   x   s    for    every   s   ∈  S   }    .       superscript  S  normal-′    conditional-set    x  A         s  x     x  s  for  every  s        S       S^{\prime}=\{x\in A:sx=xs\ \mbox{for}\ \mbox{every}\ s\in S\}.   Then:   S ′ forms a subsemigroup .       S  ′   =   S  ′′′   =   S  ′′′′′          superscript  S  normal-′    superscript  S  ′′′         superscript  S  ′′′′′      S^{\prime}=S^{\prime\prime\prime}=S^{\prime\prime\prime\prime\prime}   - A commutant is its own bicommutant .   Groups  Source:   The centralizer and normalizer of S are both subgroups of G .  Clearly, C G (S)⊆ N G (S). In fact, C G ( S ) is always a normal subgroup of N G ( S ).  C G ( C G (S)) contains S , but C G (S) need not contain S . Containment will occur if st = ts for every s and t in S . Naturally then if H is an abelian subgroup of G , C G (H) contains H .  If S is a subsemigroup of G , then N G (S) contains S .  If H is a subgroup of G , then the largest subgroup in which H is normal is the subgroup N G (H).  A subgroup H of a group G is called a of G if N G ( H ) = H .  The center of G is exactly C G (G) and G is an abelian group if and only if C G (G)=Z( G ) = G .  For singleton sets, C G ( a )= N G ( a ).  By symmetry, if S and T are two subsets of G , T ⊆ C G ( S ) if and only if S ⊆ C G ( T ).  For a subgroup H of group G , the N/C theorem states that the factor group  N G ( H )/ C G ( H ) is isomorphic to a subgroup of Aut( H ), the automorphism group of H . Since N G ( G ) = G and C G ( G ) = Z( G ), the N/C theorem also implies that G /Z( G ) is isomorphic to Inn( G ), the subgroup of Aut( G ) consisting of all inner automorphisms of G .  If we define a group homomorphism  T : G → Inn( G ) by T ( x )( g ) = T x ( g ) = xgx −1 , then we can describe N G ( S ) and C G ( S ) in terms of the group action of Inn( G ) on G : the stabilizer of S in Inn( G ) is T ( N G ( S )), and the subgroup of Inn( G ) fixing S is T ( C G ( S )).   Rings and algebras  Source:   Centralizers in rings and algebras are subrings and subalgebras, respectively, and centralizers in Lie rings and Lie algebras are Lie subrings and Lie subalgebras, respectively.  The normalizer of S in a Lie ring contains the centralizer of S .  C R ( C R ( S )) contains S but is not necessarily equal. The double centralizer theorem deals with situations where equality occurs.  If S is an additive subgroup of a Lie ring A , then N A ( S ) is the largest Lie subring of A in which S is a Lie ideal.  If S is a Lie subring of a Lie ring A , then S ⊆ N A ( S ).
