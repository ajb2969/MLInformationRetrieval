   Generic polynomial      Generic polynomial   In Galois theory , a branch of modern algebra, a generic polynomial for a finite group  G and field F is a monic polynomial  P with coefficients in the field  L = F ( t 1 , ..., t n ) of F with n  indeterminates adjoined, such that the splitting field  M of P has Galois group  G over L , and such that every extension K / F with Galois group G can be obtained as the splitting field of a polynomial which is the specialization of P resulting from setting the n indeterminates to n elements of F . This is sometimes called F-generic relative to the field F , with a Q - generic polynomial, generic relative to the rational numbers, being called simply generic.  The existence, and especially the construction, of a generic polynomial for a given Galois group provides a complete solution to the inverse Galois problem for that group. However, not all Galois groups have generic polynomials, a counterexample being the cyclic group of order eight.  Groups with generic polynomials   The symmetric group  S n . This is trivial, as        x  n   +    t  1    x   n  -  1     +  ⋯  +   t  n        superscript  x  n      subscript  t  1    superscript  x    n  1     normal-⋯   subscript  t  n     x^{n}+t_{1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+t_{n}     is a generic polynomial for S n .   Cyclic groups C n , where n is not divisible by eight. Lenstra showed that a cyclic group does not have a generic polynomial if n is divisible by eight, and Smith explicitly constructs such a polynomial in case n is not divisible by eight.    The cyclic group construction leads to other classes of generic polynomials; in particular the dihedral group  D n has a generic polynomial if and only if n is not divisible by eight.    The quaternion group  Q 8 .    Heisenberg groups     H   p  3      subscript  H   superscript  p  3     H_{p^{3}}   for any odd prime p .    The alternating group A 4 .    The alternating group A 5 .    Reflection groups defined over Q , including in particular groups of the root systems for E 6 , E 7 , and E 8 .    Any group which is a direct product of two groups both of which have generic polynomials.    Any group which is a wreath product of two groups both of which have generic polynomials.

Generic Dimension  The generic dimension for a finite group G over a field F , denoted    g   d  F   G      g   subscript  d  F   G    gd_{F}G   , is defined as the minimal number of parameters in a generic polynomial for G over F , or   ∞     \infty   if no generic polynomial exists.
