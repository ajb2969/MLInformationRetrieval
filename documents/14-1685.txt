   Jazz minor scale      Jazz minor scale     The jazz minor scale is the ascending melodic minor scale used both ascending and descending. It may be produced from the major scale by flattening the third scale degree , 1 making it a synthetic scale , and features a dominant seventh on the fifth degree (V) like the harmonic minor scale . 2 Starting on A, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8:  A B C D E F G A  The scale may be considered to originate in the use of extensions beginning with the seventh in jazz and thus the necessity to, "chromatically raise the diatonic 7th to create a stable, tonic sound," rather than use a minor seventh chord , associated with ii, for tonic. 3  The jazz minor scale contains all of the altered notes of the dominant seventh chord whose root is a semitone below the scale's tonic . "In other words to find the correct jazz minor scale for any dominant 7th chord simply use the scale whose tonic note is a half step higher than the root of the chord." 4 For example, the G7 chord and A jazz minor scale: the A scale contains the root, third, seventh, and the four most common alterations of G7. This scale may be used to resolve to C in the progression G7-C (over G7, which need not be notated G75599). 5  It is used over a minor major seventh chord . 6 See: chord-scale system . The scale also easily allows diatonic chord progressions, for example: 7 |: C-Δ7 / A-75 | D-7 / G713 :|  a I−vi−ii−V progression.  Its modes also include Lydian 5 , Lydian 7 , Locrian 2 , and the altered scale .
