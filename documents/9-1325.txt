Langlands decomposition

In mathematics, the Langlands decomposition writes a parabolic subgroup P of a semisimple Lie group as a product

 
  of a reductive subgroup M, an abelian subgroup A, and a nilpotent subgroup N.
Applications
A key application is in parabolic induction, which leads to the Langlands program: if 
 
 
 
  is a reductive algebraic group and 
 
 
 
  is the Langlands decomposition of a parabolic subgroup P, then parabolic induction consists of taking a representation of 
 
 
 
 , extending it to 
 
 
 
  by letting 
 
 
 
  act trivially, and inducing the result from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .
