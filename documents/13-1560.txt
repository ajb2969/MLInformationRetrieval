   Slowness (seismology)      Slowness (seismology)   Slowness (s) is a quantity introduced in Seismology which is the reciprocal of velocity . Thus travel time of a wave is the distance that the wave travels times the slowness of the medium ( in seismology, it refers to different layers of Earth exhibiting different densities ) Thus,  Slowness = 1/Velocity  If we divide the path followed by the ray into N segments numbered i = 1, 2 .. N the total travel time of the wave is      Γ  =    ∑   i  =  1   N     s  i   Δ   x  i         normal-Γ    superscript   subscript     i  1    N      subscript  s  i   normal-Δ   subscript  x  i       \Gamma=\sum_{i=1}^{N}s_{i}\Delta x_{i}     Therefore, the residual travel time is due to departures in slowness experienced by the wave along the raypath.
