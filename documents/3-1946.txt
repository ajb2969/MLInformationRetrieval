   Embree–Trefethen constant      Embree–Trefethen constant   In number theory , the Embree–Trefethen constant is a threshold value labelled β* . 1  For a fixed positive number β , consider the recurrence relation       x   n  +  1    =    x  n   ±   β    x   n  -  1            subscript  x    n  1     plus-or-minus   subscript  x  n     β   subscript  x    n  1        x_{n+1}=x_{n}\pm\beta x_{n-1}\,     where the sign in the sum is chosen at random for each n independently with equal probabilities for "+" and "−".  It can be proven that for any choice of β , the limit       σ   (  β  )    =    lim   n  →  ∞     (    |   x  n   |    1  /  n    )          σ  β     subscript    normal-→  n      superscript     subscript  x  n      1  n       \sigma(\beta)=\lim_{n\to\infty}(|x_{n}|^{1/n})\,     exists almost surely . In informal words, the sequence behaves exponentially with probability one, and σ ( β ) can be interpreted as its almost sure rate of exponential growth .  We have   σ < 1 for 0 < β < β* = 0.70258 approximately,   so solutions to this recurrence decay exponentially as n →∞ with probability 1, and   σ > 1 for β* < β ,   so they grow exponentially.  Regarding values of σ, we have:   σ(1) = 1.13198824... ( Viswanath's constant ), and  σ( β *) = 1.   The constant is named after applied mathematicians  Mark Embree and Lloyd N. Trefethen .
