   Hyponitrite reductase      Hyponitrite reductase   In enzymology , a hyponitrite reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 hydroxylamine + 2 NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   hyponitrous acid + 2 NADH + 2 H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are hydroxylamine and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are hyponitrous acid , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hydroxylamine:NAD+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called NADH2:hyponitrite oxidoreductase . It employs one cofactor , metal .
