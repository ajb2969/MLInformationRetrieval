   Davey–Stewartson equation      Davey–Stewartson equation   In fluid dynamics , the Davey–Stewartson equation (DSE) was introduced in a paper by  to describe the evolution of a three-dimensional wave-packet on water of finite depth.  It is a system of partial differential equations for a complex ( wave-amplitude ) field     u    u   u\,   and a real ( mean-flow ) field    ϕ    ϕ   \phi\,   :         i   u  t    +    c  0    u   x  x     +   u   y  y     =     c  1     |  u  |   2   u   +    c  2   u   ϕ  x      ,          i   subscript  u  t       subscript  c  0    subscript  u    x  x      subscript  u    y  y          subscript  c  1    superscript    u   2   u      subscript  c  2   u   subscript  ϕ  x       iu_{t}+c_{0}u_{xx}+u_{yy}=c_{1}|u|^{2}u+c_{2}u\phi_{x},\,            ϕ   x  x    +    c  3    ϕ   y  y      =    (    |  u  |   2   )   x    .         subscript  ϕ    x  x       subscript  c  3    subscript  ϕ    y  y       subscript   superscript    u   2   x     \phi_{xx}+c_{3}\phi_{yy}=(|u|^{2})_{x}.\,     The DSE is an example of a soliton equation in 2+1 dimensions. The corresponding Lax representation for it is given in .  In 1+1 dimensions the DSE reduces to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation        i   u  t    +   u   x  x    +   2  k    |  u  |   2   u    =   0.           i   subscript  u  t     subscript  u    x  x      2  k   superscript    u   2   u    0.    iu_{t}+u_{xx}+2k|u|^{2}u=0.\,     Itself, the DSE is the particular reduction of the Zakharov–Schulman system . On the other hand, the equivalent counterpart of the DSE is the Ishimori equation .  The DSE is the result of a multiple-scale analysis of modulated nonlinear surface gravity waves , propagating over a horizontal sea bed.
