   Structurable algebra      Structurable algebra   In abstract algebra , a structurable algebra is a certain kind of unital involutive  non-associative algebra over a field . For example, all Jordan algebras are structurable algebras (with the trivial involution), as is any alternative algebra with involution, or any central simple algebra with involution. An involution here means a linear anti-homomorphism whose square is the identity. 1  Assume A is a unital non-associative algebra over a field, and    x  ↦   x  ¯      maps-to  x   normal-¯  x     x\mapsto\bar{x}   is an involution. If we define      V   x  ,  y    z   :=      (   x   y  ¯    )   z   +    (   z   y  ¯    )   x    -    (   z   x  ¯    )   y       assign     subscript  V   x  y    z           x   normal-¯  y    z       z   normal-¯  y    x        z   normal-¯  x    y      V_{x,y}z:=(x\bar{y})z+(z\bar{y})x-(z\bar{x})y   , and     [  x  ,  y  ]   =    x  y   -   y  x         x  y       x  y     y  x      [x,y]=xy-yx   , then we say A is a structurable algebra if: 2       [   V   x  ,  y    ,   V   z  ,  w    ]   =    V     V   x  ,  y    z   ,  w    -   V   z  ,    V   y  ,  x    w       .        subscript  V   x  y     subscript  V   z  w        subscript  V      subscript  V   x  y    z   w     subscript  V   z     subscript  V   y  x    w        [V_{x,y},V_{z,w}]=V_{V_{x,y}z,w}-V_{z,V_{y,x}w}.     Structurable algebras were introduced by Allison in 1978. 3 The Kantor–Koecher–Tits construction produces a Lie algebra from any Jordan algebra , and this construction can be generalized so that a Lie algebra can be produced from an structurable algebra. Moreover, Allison proved over fields of characteristic zero that a structurable algebra is central simple if and only if the corresponding Lie algebra is central simple. 4  Another example of a structurable algebra is a 56-dimensional non-associative algebra originally studied by Brown in 1963, which can be constructed out of an Albert algebra . 5 When the base field is algebraically closed over characteristic not 2 or 3, the automorphism group of such an algebra has identity component equal to the simply connected exceptional algebraic group of type E 6 . 6  References  "  Category:Non-associative algebras     ↩  ↩  Garibaldi, p.658 ↩   ↩  Garibaldi, p.660 ↩
