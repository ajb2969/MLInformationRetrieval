(Pyruvate, phosphate dikinase)-phosphate phosphotransferase

(Pyruvate, phosphate dikinase)-phosphate phosphotransferase (, PPDK regulatory protein, pyruvate, phosphate dikinase regulatory protein, bifunctional dikinase regulatory protein, PDRP1 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name (pyruvate, phosphate dikinase) phosphate:phosphate phosphotransferase.12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

[pyruvate, phosphate dikinase] phosphate + phosphate

 
  [pyruvate, phosphate dikinase] + diphosphate


The enzyme from the plants maize and arabidopsis is bifunctional and also catalyses the phosphorylation of pyruvate.
