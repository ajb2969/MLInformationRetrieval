   Alcohol O-acetyltransferase      Alcohol O-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , an alcohol O-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + an alcohol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + an acetyl ester   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and alcohol , whereas its two products are CoA and acetyl ester .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:alcohol O-acetyltransferase . This enzyme is also called alcohol acetyltransferase .
