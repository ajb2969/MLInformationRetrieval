Cycle diagram of Q. Each color specifies a series of powers of any element connected to the identity element (1). For example, the cycle in red reflects the fact that i 2 = −1, i 3 = −i  and i 4 = 1. The red cycle also reflects the fact that (−i )2 = −1, (−i )3 = i  and (−i )4 = 1.

In group theory, the quaternion group is a non-abelian group of order eight, isomorphic to a certain eight-element subset of the quaternions under multiplication. It is often denoted by Q or Q8, and is given by the group presentation



where 1 is the identity element and −1 commutes with the other elements of the group.
Compared to dihedral group
The Q8 group has the same order as the dihedral group D4, but a different structure, as shown by their Cayley and cycle graphs:

 The red arrows represent multiplication on the right by i, and the green arrows represent multiplication on the right by j.

The dihedral group D4 arises in the split-quaternions in the same way that Q8 lies in the quaternions.

The multiplication of the six imaginary units {±i, ±j, ±k} works like the cross product of unit vectors in three-dimensional Euclidean space.



Properties
The quaternion group has the unusual property of being Hamiltonian: every subgroup of Q is a normal subgroup, but the group is non-abelian.2 Every Hamiltonian group contains a copy of Q.3
In abstract algebra, one can construct a real four-dimensional vector space with basis {1, i, j, k} and turn it into an associative algebra by using the above multiplication table and distributivity. The result is a skew field called the quaternions. Note that this is not quite the same as the group algebra on Q (which would be eight-dimensional). Conversely, one can start with the quaternions and define the quaternion group as the multiplicative subgroup consisting of the eight elements {1, −1, i, −i, j, −j, k, −k}. The complex four-dimensional vector space on the same basis is called the algebra of biquaternions.
Note that i, j, and k all have order four in Q and any two of them generate the entire group. Another presentation of Q4 demonstrating this is:



One may take, for instance, i = x, j = y and k = x y.
The center and the commutator subgroup of Q is the subgroup {±1}. The factor group Q/{±1} is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V. The inner automorphism group of Q is isomorphic to Q modulo its center, and is therefore also isomorphic to the Klein four-group. The full automorphism group of Q is isomorphic to S4, the symmetric group on four letters. The outer automorphism group of Q is then S4/V which is isomorphic to S3.
Matrix representations
 The quaternion group can be represented as a subgroup of the general linear group GL2(C). A representation



is given by












Since all of the above matrices have unit determinant, this is a representation of Q in the special linear group SL2(C). The standard identities for quaternion multiplication can be verified using the usual laws of matrix multiplication in GL2(C).5
 There is also an important action of Q on the eight nonzero elements of the 2-dimensional vector space over the finite field F3. A representation



is given by












where {−1,0,1} are the three elements of F3. Since all of the above matrices have unit determinant over F3, this is a representation of Q in the special linear group SL(2, 3). Indeed, the group SL(2, 3) has order 24, and Q is a normal subgroup of SL(2, 3) of index 3.
Galois group
As Richard Dean showed in 1981, the quaternion group can be presented as the Galois group Gal(T/Q) where Q is the field of rational numbers and T is the splitting field, over Q, of the polynomial


 
 . The development uses the fundamental theorem of Galois theory in specifying four intermediate fields between Q and T and their Galois groups, as well as two theorems on cyclic extension of degree four over a field.6
Generalized quaternion group
A group is called a generalized quaternion group or dicyclic group if it has a presentation7


 
  for some integer . This group is denoted Q4n and has order 4n.8 Coxeter labels these dicyclic groups , being a special case of the binary polyhedral group  and related to the polyhedral groups (p,q,r), and dihedral group (2,2,n). The usual quaternion group corresponds to the case . The generalized quaternion group can be realized as the subgroup of GL2(C) generated by



where ωn = eiπ/n.9 It can also be realized as the subgroup of unit quaternions generated by10  and .
The generalized quaternion groups have the property that every abelian subgroup is cyclic.11 It can be shown that a finite p-group with this property (every abelian subgroup is cyclic) is either cyclic or a generalized quaternion group as defined above.12 Another characterization is that a finite p-group in which there is a unique subgroup of order p is either cyclic or generalized quaternion (of order a power of 2).13 In particular, for a finite field F with odd characteristic, the 2-Sylow subgroup of SL2(F) is non-abelian and has only one subgroup of order 2, so this 2-Sylow subgroup must be a generalized quaternion group, . Letting pr be the size of F, where p is prime, the size of the 2-Sylow subgroup of SL2(F) is 2n, where .
The Brauer–Suzuki theorem shows that groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups are generalized quaternion cannot be simple.
