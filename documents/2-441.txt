   Quaternion group      Quaternion group   (Figure)  Cycle diagram of Q. Each color specifies a series of powers of any element connected to the identity element (1). For example, the cycle in red reflects the fact that i  2 = −1, i  3 = − i and i  4 = 1. The red cycle also reflects the fact that (− i ) 2 = −1, (− i ) 3 = i and (− i ) 4 = 1.   In group theory , the quaternion group is a non-abelian  group of order eight, isomorphic to a certain eight-element subset of the quaternions under multiplication. It is often denoted by Q or Q 8 , and is given by the group presentation       Q  =   ⟨    -  1   ,  i  ,  j  ,  k   ∣      (   -  1   )   2   =  1   ,    i  2   =   j  2   =   k  2   =   i  j  k   =   -  1     ⟩    ,      normal-Q   inner-product     1   i  j  k    formulae-sequence     superscript    1   2   1        superscript  i  2    superscript  j  2         superscript  k  2          i  j  k          1         \mathrm{Q}=\langle-1,i,j,k\mid(-1)^{2}=1,\;i^{2}=j^{2}=k^{2}=ijk=-1\rangle,\,\!     where 1 is the identity element and −1 commutes with the other elements of the group.  Compared to dihedral group  The Q 8 group has the same order as the dihedral group  D 4 , but a different structure, as shown by their Cayley and cycle graphs:      Cayley graph   Cycle graphs       Q 8 The red arrows represent multiplication on the right by i , and the green arrows represent multiplication on the right by j .   Dih 4  Dihedral group     The dihedral group D 4 arises in the split-quaternions in the same way that Q 8 lies in the quaternions.  Cayley table  The Cayley table (multiplication table) for Q is given by: 1      Q×Q   1   −1   i   − i   j   − j   k   − k       1   1   −1   i   − i   j   − j   k   − k     −1   −1   1   − i   i   − j   j   − k   k     i   i   − i   −1   1   k   − k   − j   j     − i   − i   i   1   −1   − k   k   j   − j     j   j   − j   − k   k   −1   1   i   − i     − j   − j   j   k   − k   1   −1   − i   i     k   k   − k   j   − j   − i   i   −1   1     − k   − k   k   − j   j   i   − i   1   −1     The multiplication of the six imaginary units {± i , ± j , ± k } works like the cross product of unit vectors in three-dimensional Euclidean space .      i  j      i  j    \displaystyle ij     Properties  The quaternion group has the unusual property of being Hamiltonian : every subgroup of Q is a normal subgroup , but the group is non-abelian. 2 Every Hamiltonian group contains a copy of Q. 3  In abstract algebra , one can construct a real four-dimensional vector space with basis {1, i , j , k } and turn it into an associative algebra by using the above multiplication table and distributivity . The result is a skew field called the quaternions . Note that this is not quite the same as the group algebra on Q (which would be eight-dimensional). Conversely, one can start with the quaternions and define the quaternion group as the multiplicative subgroup consisting of the eight elements {1, −1, i , − i , j , − j , k , − k }. The complex four-dimensional vector space on the same basis is called the algebra of biquaternions .  Note that i , j , and k all have order four in Q and any two of them generate the entire group. Another presentation of Q 4 demonstrating this is:       ⟨   x  ,  y   ∣     x  4   =  1   ,     x  2   =   y  2    ,     y   -  1    x  y   =   x   -  1       ⟩   .     inner-product   x  y    formulae-sequence     superscript  x  4   1    formulae-sequence     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2         superscript  y    1    x  y    superscript  x    1         \langle x,y\mid x^{4}=1,x^{2}=y^{2},y^{-1}xy=x^{-1}\rangle.\,\!     One may take, for instance, i = x , j = y and k = x y .  The center and the commutator subgroup of Q is the subgroup {±1}. The factor group Q/{±1} is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V. The inner automorphism group of Q is isomorphic to Q modulo its center, and is therefore also isomorphic to the Klein four-group. The full automorphism group of Q is isomorphic to S 4 , the symmetric group on four letters. The outer automorphism group of Q is then S 4 /V which is isomorphic to S 3 .  Matrix representations  The quaternion group can be represented as a subgroup of the general linear group GL 2 ( C ). A representation      Q  =   {   ±  1   ,   ±  i   ,   ±  j   ,   ±  k   }   →    GL  2    (  𝐂  )          normal-Q    plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  i    plus-or-minus  j    plus-or-minus  k      normal-→       subscript  GL  2   𝐂      \mathrm{Q}=\{\pm 1,\pm i,\pm j,\pm k\}\to\mathrm{GL}_{2}(\mathbf{C})     is given by      1  ↦   (     1    0      0    1     )      maps-to  1    1  0    0  1      1\mapsto\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\
 0&1\end{pmatrix}         i  ↦   (     i    0      0     -  i      )      maps-to  i    i  0    0    i       i\mapsto\begin{pmatrix}i&0\\
 0&-i\end{pmatrix}         j  ↦   (     0    1       -  1     0     )      maps-to  j    0  1      1   0      j\mapsto\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\
 -1&0\end{pmatrix}         k  ↦   (     0    i      i    0     )      maps-to  k    0  i    i  0      k\mapsto\begin{pmatrix}0&i\\
 i&0\end{pmatrix}     Since all of the above matrices have unit determinant, this is a representation of Q in the special linear group SL 2 ( C ). The standard identities for quaternion multiplication can be verified using the usual laws of matrix multiplication in GL 2 ( C ). 5  There is also an important action of Q on the eight nonzero elements of the 2-dimensional vector space over the finite field  F 3 . A representation      Q  =   {   ±  1   ,   ±  i   ,   ±  j   ,   ±  k   }   →   GL   (  2  ,  3  )          normal-Q    plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  i    plus-or-minus  j    plus-or-minus  k      normal-→      GL   2  3       \mathrm{Q}=\{\pm 1,\pm i,\pm j,\pm k\}\to\mathrm{GL}(2,3)     is given by      1  ↦   (     1    0      0    1     )      maps-to  1    1  0    0  1      1\mapsto\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\
 0&1\end{pmatrix}         i  ↦   (     1    1      1     -  1      )      maps-to  i    1  1    1    1       i\mapsto\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\
 1&-1\end{pmatrix}         j  ↦   (      -  1     1      1    1     )      maps-to  j      1   1    1  1      j\mapsto\begin{pmatrix}-1&1\\
 1&1\end{pmatrix}         k  ↦   (     0     -  1       1    0     )      maps-to  k    0    1     1  0      k\mapsto\begin{pmatrix}0&-1\\
 1&0\end{pmatrix}     where {−1,0,1} are the three elements of F 3 . Since all of the above matrices have unit determinant over F 3 , this is a representation of Q in the special linear group SL(2, 3). Indeed, the group SL(2, 3) has order 24, and Q is a normal subgroup of SL(2, 3) of index 3.  Galois group  As Richard Dean showed in 1981, the quaternion group can be presented as the Galois group Gal( T /Q) where Q is the field of rational numbers and T is the splitting field , over Q, of the polynomial          x  8   -   72   x  6     +   180   x  4     -   144   x  2     +  36             superscript  x  8     72   superscript  x  6       180   superscript  x  4       144   superscript  x  2     36    x^{8}-72x^{6}+180x^{4}-144x^{2}+36   . The development uses the fundamental theorem of Galois theory in specifying four intermediate fields between Q and T and their Galois groups, as well as two theorems on cyclic extension of degree four over a field. 6  Generalized quaternion group  A group is called a generalized quaternion group or dicyclic group if it has a presentation 7       ⟨   x  ,  y   ∣     x   2  n    =   y  4   =  1   ,     x  n   =   y  2    ,     y   -  1    x  y   =   x   -  1       ⟩   .     inner-product   x  y    formulae-sequence       superscript  x    2  n     superscript  y  4        1     formulae-sequence     superscript  x  n    superscript  y  2         superscript  y    1    x  y    superscript  x    1         \langle x,y\mid x^{2n}=y^{4}=1,x^{n}=y^{2},y^{-1}xy=x^{-1}\rangle.\,\!   for some integer . This group is denoted Q 4 n and has order 4 n . 8  Coxeter labels these dicyclic groups , being a special case of the binary polyhedral group and related to the polyhedral groups (p,q,r), and dihedral group (2,2,n). The usual quaternion group corresponds to the case . The generalized quaternion group can be realized as the subgroup of GL 2 ( C ) generated by       (      ω  n     0      0      ω  ¯   n      )   and   (     0     -  1       1    0     )          subscript  ω  n   0    0   subscript   normal-¯  ω   n     and    0    1     1  0      \left(\begin{array}[]{cc}\omega_{n}&0\\
 0&\overline{\omega}_{n}\end{array}\right)\mbox{ and }\left(\begin{array}[]{cc}%
 0&-1\\
 1&0\end{array}\right)     where ω n = e iπ/ n . 9 It can also be realized as the subgroup of unit quaternions generated by 10  and .  The generalized quaternion groups have the property that every abelian subgroup is cyclic. 11 It can be shown that a finite p -group with this property (every abelian subgroup is cyclic) is either cyclic or a generalized quaternion group as defined above. 12 Another characterization is that a finite p -group in which there is a unique subgroup of order p is either cyclic or generalized quaternion (of order a power of 2). 13 In particular, for a finite field F with odd characteristic, the 2-Sylow subgroup of SL 2 ( F ) is non-abelian and has only one subgroup of order 2, so this 2-Sylow subgroup must be a generalized quaternion group, . Letting p r be the size of F , where p is prime, the size of the 2-Sylow subgroup of SL 2 ( F ) is 2 n , where .  The Brauer–Suzuki theorem shows that groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups are generalized quaternion cannot be simple.
