   Protein-fructosamine 3-kinase      Protein-fructosamine 3-kinase   Protein-fructosamine 3-kinase (, FN3K , fructosamine 3-kinase ) is an enzyme with system name ATP:(protein)-N 6 -D-fructosyl-L-lysine 3-phosphotransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   ATP + [protein]-N 6 -D-fructosyl-L-lysine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + [protein]-N 6 -(3-O-phospho-D-fructosyl)-L-lysine   Nonenzymatic glycation is a factor in the pathogenesis of diabetes .
