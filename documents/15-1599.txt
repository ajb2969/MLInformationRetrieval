Protein-fructosamine 3-kinase

Protein-fructosamine 3-kinase (, FN3K, fructosamine 3-kinase) is an enzyme with system name ATP:(protein)-N6-D-fructosyl-L-lysine 3-phosphotransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ATP + [protein]-N6-D-fructosyl-L-lysine 
 
 
 
  ADP + [protein]-N6-(3-O-phospho-D-fructosyl)-L-lysine
 

Nonenzymatic glycation is a factor in the pathogenesis of diabetes.
