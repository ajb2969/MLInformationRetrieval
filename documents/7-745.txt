   Vector-valued differential form      Vector-valued differential form   In mathematics , a vector-valued differential form on a manifold  M is a differential form on M with values in a vector space  V . More generally, it is a differential form with values in some vector bundle  E over M . Ordinary differential forms can be viewed as R -valued differential forms.  An important case of vector-valued differential forms are Lie algebra-valued forms . (A connection form is an example of such a form.)  Formal definition  Let M be a smooth manifold and E → M be a smooth vector bundle over M . We denote the space of smooth sections of a bundle E by Γ( E ). An E -valued differential form of degree p is a smooth section of the tensor product bundle of E with Λ p ( T * M ), the p -th exterior power of the cotangent bundle of M . The space of such forms is denoted by         Ω  p    (  M  ,  E  )    =   Γ   (    E  ⊗   Λ  p     T  *   M   )     .         superscript  normal-Ω  p    M  E      normal-Γ     tensor-product  E   superscript  normal-Λ  p     superscript  T    M      \Omega^{p}(M,E)=\Gamma(E\otimes\Lambda^{p}T^{*}M).   Because Γ is a monoidal functor , 1 this can also be interpreted as        Γ   (    E  ⊗   Λ  p     T  *   M   )    =     Γ   (  E  )     ⊗    Ω  0    (  M  )     Γ    (    Λ  p    T  *   M   )    =     Γ   (  E  )     ⊗    Ω  0    (  M  )      Ω  p     (  M  )     ,          normal-Γ     tensor-product  E   superscript  normal-Λ  p     superscript  T    M        subscript  tensor-product     superscript  normal-Ω  0   M      normal-Γ  E   normal-Γ      superscript  normal-Λ  p    superscript  T    M             subscript  tensor-product     superscript  normal-Ω  0   M      normal-Γ  E    superscript  normal-Ω  p    M      \Gamma(E\otimes\Lambda^{p}T^{*}M)=\Gamma(E)\otimes_{\Omega^{0}(M)}\Gamma(%
 \Lambda^{p}T^{*}M)=\Gamma(E)\otimes_{\Omega^{0}(M)}\Omega^{p}(M),   where the latter two tensor products are the tensor product of modules over the ring Ω 0 ( M ) of smooth R -valued functions on M (see the sixth example here ). By convention, an E -valued 0-form is just a section of the bundle E . That is,         Ω  0    (  M  ,  E  )    =   Γ   (  E  )     .         superscript  normal-Ω  0    M  E      normal-Γ  E     \Omega^{0}(M,E)=\Gamma(E).\,   Equivalently, a E -valued differential form can be defined as a bundle morphism         T  M   ⊗  ⋯  ⊗  T   M   →  E     normal-→     tensor-product    T  M   normal-⋯  T   M   E    TM\otimes\cdots\otimes TM\to E   which is totally skew-symmetric .  Let V be a fixed vector space . A V -valued differential form of degree p is a differential form of degree p with values in the trivial bundle  M × V . The space of such forms is denoted Ω p ( M , V ). When V = R one recovers the definition of an ordinary differential form. If V is finite-dimensional, then one can show that the natural homomorphism          Ω  p    (  M  )     ⊗  ℝ   V   →    Ω  p    (  M  ,  V  )     ,     normal-→    subscript  tensor-product  ℝ      superscript  normal-Ω  p   M   V      superscript  normal-Ω  p    M  V      \Omega^{p}(M)\otimes_{\mathbb{R}}V\to\Omega^{p}(M,V),   where the first tensor product is of vector spaces over R , is an isomorphism. Proof: One can verify this for p =0 by turning a basis for V into a set of constant functions to V , which allows the construction of an inverse to the above homomorphism. The general case can be proved by noting that         Ω  p    (  M  ,  V  )    =      Ω  0    (  M  ,  V  )     ⊗    Ω  0    (  M  )      Ω  p     (  M  )     ,         superscript  normal-Ω  p    M  V        subscript  tensor-product     superscript  normal-Ω  0   M       superscript  normal-Ω  0    M  V     superscript  normal-Ω  p    M     \Omega^{p}(M,V)=\Omega^{0}(M,V)\otimes_{\Omega^{0}(M)}\Omega^{p}(M),   and that because   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   is a sub-ring of Ω 0 ( M ) via the constant functions,           Ω  0    (  M  ,  V  )     ⊗    Ω  0    (  M  )      Ω  p     (  M  )    =     (    V   ⊗  ℝ    Ω  0     (  M  )    )    ⊗    Ω  0    (  M  )      Ω  p     (  M  )    =   V   ⊗  ℝ    (      Ω  0    (  M  )     ⊗    Ω  0    (  M  )      Ω  p     (  M  )    )    =    V   ⊗  ℝ    Ω  p     (  M  )     .            subscript  tensor-product     superscript  normal-Ω  0   M       superscript  normal-Ω  0    M  V     superscript  normal-Ω  p    M       subscript  tensor-product     superscript  normal-Ω  0   M        subscript  tensor-product  ℝ   V   superscript  normal-Ω  0    M    superscript  normal-Ω  p    M          subscript  tensor-product  ℝ   V      subscript  tensor-product     superscript  normal-Ω  0   M       superscript  normal-Ω  0   M    superscript  normal-Ω  p    M             subscript  tensor-product  ℝ   V   superscript  normal-Ω  p    M      \Omega^{0}(M,V)\otimes_{\Omega^{0}(M)}\Omega^{p}(M)=(V\otimes_{\mathbb{R}}%

 ^{p}(M).     Operations on vector-valued forms  Pullback  One can define the pullback of vector-valued forms by smooth maps just as for ordinary forms. The pullback of an E -valued form on N by a smooth map φ : M → N is an (φ* E )-valued form on M , where φ* E is the pullback bundle of E by φ.  The formula is given just as in the ordinary case. For any E -valued p -form ω on N the pullback φ*ω is given by          (    φ  *   ω   )   x    (   v  1   ,  ⋯  ,   v  p   )    =    ω   φ   (  x  )      (   d   φ  x    (   v  1   )    ,  ⋯  ,   d   φ  x    (   v  p   )    )     .         subscript     superscript  φ    ω   x     subscript  v  1   normal-⋯   subscript  v  p        subscript  ω    φ  x       normal-d   subscript  φ  x    subscript  v  1    normal-⋯    normal-d   subscript  φ  x    subscript  v  p        (\varphi^{*}\omega)_{x}(v_{1},\cdots,v_{p})=\omega_{\varphi(x)}(\mathrm{d}%
 \varphi_{x}(v_{1}),\cdots,\mathrm{d}\varphi_{x}(v_{p})).     Wedge product  Just as for ordinary differential forms, one can define a wedge product of vector-valued forms. The wedge product of an E 1 -valued p -form with an E 2 -valued q -form is naturally an ( E 1 E 2 )-valued ( p + q )-form:      ∧  :   Ω  p    (  M  ,   E  1   )   ×   Ω  q    (  M  ,   E  2   )   →   Ω   p  +  q     (  M  ,   E  1   ⊗   E  2   )   .     fragments   normal-:   superscript  normal-Ω  p    fragments  normal-(  M  normal-,   subscript  E  1   normal-)     superscript  normal-Ω  q    fragments  normal-(  M  normal-,   subscript  E  2   normal-)   normal-→   superscript  normal-Ω    p  q     fragments  normal-(  M  normal-,   subscript  E  1   tensor-product   subscript  E  2   normal-)   normal-.    \wedge:\Omega^{p}(M,E_{1})\times\Omega^{q}(M,E_{2})\to\Omega^{p+q}(M,E_{1}%
 \otimes E_{2}).   The definition is just as for ordinary forms with the exception that real multiplication is replaced with the tensor product :         (   ω  ∧  η   )    (   v  1   ,  ⋯  ,   v   p  +  q    )    =    1    (   p  +  q   )   !      ∑   σ  ∈   S   p  +  q          sgn   (  σ  )    ω   (   v   σ   (  1  )     ,  ⋯  ,   v   σ   (  p  )     )    ⊗  η    (   v   σ   (   p  +  1   )     ,  ⋯  ,   v   σ   (   p  +  q   )     )       .          ω  η     subscript  v  1   normal-⋯   subscript  v    p  q          1      p  q       subscript     σ   subscript  S    p  q         tensor-product     sgn  σ   ω    subscript  v    σ  1    normal-⋯   subscript  v    σ  p      η     subscript  v    σ    p  1     normal-⋯   subscript  v    σ    p  q           (\omega\wedge\eta)(v_{1},\cdots,v_{p+q})=\frac{1}{(p+q)!}\sum_{\sigma\in S_{p+%
 q}}\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)\omega(v_{\sigma(1)},\cdots,v_{\sigma(p)})\otimes%
 \eta(v_{\sigma(p+1)},\cdots,v_{\sigma(p+q)}).   In particular, the wedge product of an ordinary ( R -valued) p -form with an E -valued q -form is naturally an E -valued ( p + q )-form (since the tensor product of E with the trivial bundle M × R is naturally isomorphic to E ). For ω ∈ Ω p ( M ) and η ∈ Ω q ( M , E ) one has the usual commutativity relation:        ω  ∧  η   =      (   -  1   )    p  q    η   ∧  ω    .        ω  η        superscript    1     p  q    η   ω     \omega\wedge\eta=(-1)^{pq}\eta\wedge\omega.     In general, the wedge product of two E -valued forms is not another E -valued form, but rather an ( E E )-valued form. However, if E is an algebra bundle (i.e. a bundle of algebras rather than just vector spaces) one can compose with multiplication in E to obtain an E -valued form. If E is a bundle of commutative , associative algebras then, with this modified wedge product, the set of all E -valued differential forms       Ω   (  M  ,  E  )    =    ⊕   p  =  0    dim  M      Ω  p    (  M  ,  E  )           normal-Ω   M  E      superscript   subscript  direct-sum    p  0     dimension  M       superscript  normal-Ω  p    M  E       \Omega(M,E)=\bigoplus_{p=0}^{\dim M}\Omega^{p}(M,E)   becomes a graded-commutative associative algebra. If the fibers of E are not commutative then Ω( M , E ) will not be graded-commutative.  Exterior derivative  For any vector space V there is a natural exterior derivative on the space of V -valued forms. This is just the ordinary exterior derivative acting component-wise relative to any basis of V . Explicitly, if { e α } is a basis for V then the differential of a V -valued p -form ω = ω α e α is given by        d  ω   =    (   d   ω  α    )    e  α     .        d  ω       d   superscript  ω  α     subscript  e  α      d\omega=(d\omega^{\alpha})e_{\alpha}.\,   The exterior derivative on V -valued forms is completely characterized by the usual relations:       d  ;   (   ω  +  η   )    =    d  ω   +   d  η         d    ω  η        d  ω     d  η      \displaystyle d;(\omega+\eta)=d\omega+d\eta   More generally, the above remarks apply to E -valued forms where E is any flat vector bundle over M (i.e. a vector bundle whose transition functions are constant). The exterior derivative is defined as above on any local trivialization of E .  If E is not flat then there is no natural notion of an exterior derivative acting on E -valued forms. What is needed is a choice of connection on E . A connection on E is a linear differential operator taking sections of E to E -valued one forms:       ∇  :     Ω  0    (  M  ,  E  )    →    Ω  1    (  M  ,  E  )      .     normal-:  normal-∇   normal-→     superscript  normal-Ω  0    M  E       superscript  normal-Ω  1    M  E       \nabla:\Omega^{0}(M,E)\to\Omega^{1}(M,E).   If E is equipped with a connection ∇ then there is a unique covariant exterior derivative       d  ∇   :     Ω  p    (  M  ,  E  )    →    Ω   p  +  1     (  M  ,  E  )        normal-:   subscript  d  normal-∇    normal-→     superscript  normal-Ω  p    M  E       superscript  normal-Ω    p  1     M  E       d_{\nabla}:\Omega^{p}(M,E)\to\Omega^{p+1}(M,E)   extending ∇. The covariant exterior derivative is characterized by linearity and the equation        d  ∇    (   ω  ∧  η   )    =       d  ∇   ω   ∧  η   +      (   -  1   )   p    ω    ∧   d  η           subscript  d  normal-∇     ω  η             subscript  d  normal-∇   ω   η      superscript    1   p   ω      d  η      d_{\nabla}(\omega\wedge\eta)=d_{\nabla}\omega\wedge\eta+(-1)^{p}\,\omega\wedge
 d\eta   where ω is a E -valued p -form and η is an ordinary q -form. In general, one need not have d ∇ 2 = 0. In fact, this happens if and only if the connection ∇ is flat (i.e. has vanishing curvature ).  Basic or tensorial forms on principal bundles  Let E → M be a smooth vector bundle of rank k over M and let π : F( E ) → M be the ( associated ) frame bundle of E , which is a principal GL k ( R ) bundle over M . The pullback of E by π is canonically isomorphic to F( E ) × ρ  R k via the inverse of [ u , v ] → u ( v ), where ρ is the standard representation. Therefore, the pullback by π of an E -valued form on M determines an R k -valued form on F( E ). It is not hard to check that this pulled back form is right-equivariant with respect to the natural action of GL k ( R ) on F( E ) × R k and vanishes on vertical vectors (tangent vectors to F( E ) which lie in the kernel of d π ). Such vector-valued forms on F( E ) are important enough to warrant special terminology: they are called basic or tensorial forms on F( E ).  Let π : P → M be a (smooth) principal G -bundle and let V be a fixed vector space together with a representation  ρ : G → GL( V ). A basic or tensorial form on P of type ρ is a V -valued form ω on P which is equivariant and horizontal in the sense that          (   R  g   )   *   ω   =   ρ   (   g   -  1    )    ω           superscript   subscript  R  g     ω     ρ   superscript  g    1    ω     (R_{g})^{*}\omega=\rho(g^{-1})\omega\,   for all g ∈ G , and       ω   (   v  1   ,  …  ,   v  p   )    =  0        ω    subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  p     0    \omega(v_{1},\ldots,v_{p})=0   whenever at least one of the v i are vertical (i.e., d π ( v i ) = 0).   Here R g denotes the right action of G on P for some g ∈ G . Note that for 0-forms the second condition is vacuously true .   Example: If ρ is the adjoint representation of G on the Lie algebra, then the connection form ω satisfies the first condition (but not the second). The associated curvature form Ω satisfies both; hence Ω is a tensorial form of adjoint type. The "difference" of two connection forms is a tensorial form.   Given P and ρ as above one can construct the associated vector bundle  E = P × ρ  V . Tensorial q -forms on P are in a natural one-to-one correspondence with E -valued q -forms on M . As in the case of the principal bundle F( E ) above, given a q -form    ϕ  ¯     normal-¯  ϕ    \overline{\phi}   on M with values in E , define φ on P fiberwise by, say at u ,      ϕ  =    u   -  1     π  *    ϕ  ¯        ϕ     superscript  u    1     superscript  π     normal-¯  ϕ      \phi=u^{-1}\pi^{*}\overline{\phi}   where u is viewed as a linear isomorphism      V   →  ≃    E   π   (  u  )      =    (    π  *   E   )   u    ,   v  ↦   [  u  ,  v  ]       formulae-sequence      V   similar-to-or-equals  normal-→    subscript  E    π  u      subscript     superscript  π    E   u     maps-to  v   u  v      V\overset{\simeq}{\to}E_{\pi(u)}=(\pi^{*}E)_{u},v\mapsto[u,v]   . φ is then a tensorial form of type ρ. Conversely, given a tensorial form φ of type ρ, the same formula defines an E -valued form    ϕ  ¯     normal-¯  ϕ    \overline{\phi}   on M (cf. the Chern–Weil homomorphism .) In particular, there is a natural isomorphism of vector spaces      Γ   (  M  ,  E  )   ≃   {  f  :  P  →  V  |  f   (  u  g  )   =  ρ    (  g  )    -  1    f   (  u  )   }   ,   f  ¯   ↔  f     fragments  Γ   fragments  normal-(  M  normal-,  E  normal-)   similar-to-or-equals   fragments  normal-{  f  normal-:  P  normal-→  V  normal-|  f   fragments  normal-(  u  g  normal-)    ρ   superscript   fragments  normal-(  g  normal-)     1    f   fragments  normal-(  u  normal-)   normal-}   normal-,   normal-¯  f   normal-↔  f    \Gamma(M,E)\simeq\{f:P\to V|f(ug)=\rho(g)^{-1}f(u)\},\,\overline{f}\leftrightarrow
 f   .   Example: Let E be the tangent bundle of M . Then identity bundle map id E : E → E is an E -valued one form on M . The tautological one-form is a unique one-form on the frame bundle of E that corresponds to id E . Denoted by θ, it is a tensorial form of standard type.   Now, suppose there is a connection on P so that there is an exterior covariant differentiation  D on (various) vector-valued forms on P . Through the above correspondence, D also acts on E -valued forms: define ∇ by        ∇   ϕ  ¯    =    D  ϕ   ¯    .       normal-∇   normal-¯  ϕ     normal-¯    D  ϕ      \nabla\overline{\phi}=\overline{D\phi}.   In particular for zero-forms,      ∇  :    Γ   (  M  ,  E  )    →   Γ   (  M  ,     T  *   M   ⊗  E   )        normal-:  normal-∇   normal-→    normal-Γ   M  E      normal-Γ   M   tensor-product     superscript  T    M   E        \nabla:\Gamma(M,E)\to\Gamma(M,T^{*}M\otimes E)   . This is exactly the covariant derivative for the connection on the vector bundle E . 2  Notes  References   Shoshichi Kobayashi and Katsumi Nomizu (1963) Foundations of Differential Geometry , Vol. 1, Wiley Interscience .
