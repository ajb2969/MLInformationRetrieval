   Low-density-lipoprotein receptor kinase      Low-density-lipoprotein receptor kinase   In enzymology , a low-density-lipoprotein receptor kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + [low-density-lipoprotein receptor]-L-serine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + [low-density-lipoprotein receptor]-O-phospho-L-serine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and [[[low-density-lipoprotein receptor]-L-serine]], whereas its two products are ADP and [[[low-density-lipoprotein receptor]-O-phospho-L-serine]].  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring a phosphate group to the sidechain oxygen atom of serine or threonine residues in proteins ( protein-serine/threonine kinases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:[low-density-lipoprotein receptor]-L-serine O-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include ATP:low-density-lipoprotein-L-serine O-phosphotransferase , LDL receptor kinase , [low-density-lipoprotein] kinase , low-density lipoprotein kinase , low-density-lipoprotein receptor kinase (phosphorylating) , and STK7 .
