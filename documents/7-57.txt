   Distributed Bragg reflector      Distributed Bragg reflector   A distributed Bragg reflector ( DBR ) is a reflector used in waveguides , such as optical fibers . It is a structure formed from multiple layers of alternating materials with varying refractive index , or by periodic variation of some characteristic (such as height) of a dielectric waveguide, resulting in periodic variation in the effective refractive index in the guide. Each layer boundary causes a partial reflection of an optical wave. For waves whose wavelength is close to four times the optical thickness of the layers, the many reflections combine with constructive interference , and the layers act as a high-quality reflector. The range of wavelengths that are reflected is called the photonic stopband . Within this range of wavelengths, light is "forbidden" to propagate in the structure.  Reflectivity  The DBR's reflectivity ,   R   R   R   , for intensity is approximately given by 1       R  =    [      n  o     (   n  2   )    2  N     -    n  s     (   n  1   )    2  N         n  o     (   n  2   )    2  N     +    n  s     (   n  1   )    2  N       ]   2    ,      R   superscript   delimited-[]         subscript  n  o    superscript   subscript  n  2     2  N        subscript  n  s    superscript   subscript  n  1     2  N           subscript  n  o    superscript   subscript  n  2     2  N        subscript  n  s    superscript   subscript  n  1     2  N        2     R=\left[\frac{n_{o}(n_{2})^{2N}-n_{s}(n_{1})^{2N}}{n_{o}(n_{2})^{2N}+n_{s}(n_{%
 1})^{2N}}\right]^{2},     where     n  o   ,   n  1   ,   n  2       subscript  n  o    subscript  n  1    subscript  n  2     n_{o},\ n_{1},\ n_{2}   and     n  s      subscript  n  s    n_{s}\,   are the respective refractive indices of the originating medium, the two alternating materials, and the terminating medium (i.e. backing or substrate); and   N   N   N   is the number of repeated pairs of low/high refractive index material.  The frequency bandwidth     Δ   f  0       normal-Δ   subscript  f  0     \Delta f_{0}   of the photonic stopband can be calculated by         Δ   f  0     f  0    =    4  π    arcsin   (     n  2   -   n  1      n  2   +   n  1     )      ,          normal-Δ   subscript  f  0     subscript  f  0        4  π          subscript  n  2    subscript  n  1       subscript  n  2    subscript  n  1         \frac{\Delta f_{0}}{f_{0}}=\frac{4}{\pi}\arcsin\left(\frac{n_{2}-n_{1}}{n_{2}+%
 n_{1}}\right),   where    f  o     subscript  f  o    f_{o}   is the central frequency of the band.  Increasing the number of pairs in a DBR increases the mirror reflectivity and increasing the refractive index contrast between the materials in the Bragg pairs increases both the reflectivity and the bandwidth. A common choice of materials for the stack is titanium dioxide ( n ≈2.5) and silica ( n ≈1.5). 2 Substituting into the formula above gives a bandwidth of about 200 nm for 630 nm light.  Distributed Bragg reflectors are critical components in vertical cavity surface emitting lasers and other types of narrow-linewidth laser diodes such as distributed feedback (DFB) lasers and distributed bragg reflector (DBR) lasers . They are also used to form the cavity resonator (or optical cavity ) in fiber lasers and free electron lasers .
