In enzymology, an octadecanal decarbonylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

octadecanal 
 
 
 
 
  heptadecane + CO
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, octadecanal, and two products, heptadecane and CO.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically in the "catch-all" class of carbon-carbon lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is octadecanal alkane-lyase. Other names in common use include decarbonylase, and aldehyde decarbonylase. At least one compound, EDTA is known to inhibit this enzyme.
