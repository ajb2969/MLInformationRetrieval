   Self-financing portfolio      Self-financing portfolio   A self-financing portfolio is an important concept in financial mathematics .  A portfolio is self-financing if there is no exogenous infusion or withdrawal of money; the purchase of a new asset must be financed by the sale of an old one.  Mathematical definition  Let     h  i    (  t  )        subscript  h  i   t    h_{i}(t)   denote the number of stock number 'i' in the portfolio at time   t   t   t   , and     S  i    (  t  )        subscript  S  i   t    S_{i}(t)   the price of stock number 'i' in a frictionless market with trading in continuous time. Let        V   (  t  )    =    ∑   i  =  1   n     h  i    (  t  )    S  i    (  t  )      .        V  t     superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  h  i   t   subscript  S  i   t      V(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}h_{i}(t)S_{i}(t).     Then the portfolio    (    h  1    (  t  )    ,  …  ,    h  n    (  t  )    )        subscript  h  1   t   normal-…     subscript  h  n   t     (h_{1}(t),\dots,h_{n}(t))   is self-financing if        d  V   (  t  )    =    ∑   i  =  1   n     h  i    (  t  )   d   S  i    (  t  )      .        d  V  t     superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  h  i   t  d   subscript  S  i   t      dV(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}h_{i}(t)dS_{i}(t).    1  Discrete time  Assume we are given a discrete filtered probability space     (  Ω  ,  ℱ  ,    {   ℱ  t   }    t  =  0   T   ,  P  )     normal-Ω  ℱ   superscript   subscript    subscript  ℱ  t      t  0    T   P    (\Omega,\mathcal{F},\{\mathcal{F}_{t}\}_{t=0}^{T},P)   , and let    K  t     subscript  K  t    K_{t}   be the solvency cone (with or without transaction costs ) at time t for the market. Denote by     L  d  p    (   K  t   )   =   {  X  ∈   L  d  p    (   ℱ  T   )   :  X  ∈    K  t    P  -  a  .  s  .  }      fragments   superscript   subscript  L  d   p    fragments  normal-(   subscript  K  t   normal-)     fragments  normal-{  X    superscript   subscript  L  d   p    fragments  normal-(   subscript  ℱ  T   normal-)   normal-:  X    subscript  K  t   P   a  normal-.  s  normal-.  normal-}     L_{d}^{p}(K_{t})=\{X\in L_{d}^{p}(\mathcal{F}_{T}):X\in K_{t}\;P-a.s.\}   . Then a portfolio     (   H  t   )    t  =  0   T     superscript   subscript   subscript  H  t     t  0    T    (H_{t})_{t=0}^{T}   (in physical units, i.e. the number of each stock) is self-financing (with trading on a finite set of times only) if   for all    t  ∈   {  0  ,  1  ,  …  ,  T  }       t   0  1  normal-…  T     t\in\{0,1,\dots,T\}   we have that        H  t   -   H   t  -  1     ∈    -     K  t    P    -  a    .  s   .     formulae-sequence       subscript  H  t    subscript  H    t  1            subscript  K  t   P    a    s    H_{t}-H_{t-1}\in-K_{t}\;P-a.s.   with the convention that     H   -  1    =  0       subscript  H    1    0    H_{-1}=0   . 2    If we are only concerned with the set that the portfolio can be at some future time then we can say that     H  τ   ∈    -   K  0    -    ∑   k  =  1   τ     L  d  p    (   K  k   )           subscript  H  τ        subscript  K  0      superscript   subscript     k  1    τ      superscript   subscript  L  d   p    subscript  K  k        H_{\tau}\in-K_{0}-\sum_{k=1}^{\tau}L_{d}^{p}(K_{k})   .  If there are transaction costs then only discrete trading should be considered, and in continuous time then the above calculations should be taken to the limit such that     Δ  t   →  0     normal-→    normal-Δ  t   0    \Delta t\to 0   .
