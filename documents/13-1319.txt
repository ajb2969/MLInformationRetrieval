Self-financing portfolio

A self-financing portfolio is an important concept in financial mathematics.
A portfolio is self-financing if there is no exogenous infusion or withdrawal of money; the purchase of a new asset must be financed by the sale of an old one.
Mathematical definition
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the number of stock number 'i' in the portfolio at time 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  the price of stock number 'i' in a frictionless market with trading in continuous time. Let



Then the portfolio 
 
 
 
  is self-financing if

Discrete time
Assume we are given a discrete filtered probability space

 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be the solvency cone (with or without transaction costs) at time t for the market. Denote by 
 
 
 
 
 . Then a portfolio 
 
 
 
  (in physical units, i.e. the number of each stock) is self-financing (with trading on a finite set of times only) if

for all 
 
 
 
  we have that 
 
 
 
  with the convention that

If we are only concerned with the set that the portfolio can be at some future time then we can say that 
 
 
 
 
 .
If there are transaction costs then only discrete trading should be considered, and in continuous time then the above calculations should be taken to the limit such that
