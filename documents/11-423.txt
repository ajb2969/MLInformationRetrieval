   6-acetylglucose deacetylase      6-acetylglucose deacetylase   In enzymology , a 6-acetylglucose deacetylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   6-acetyl-D-glucose + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucose + acetate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 6-acetyl-D-glucose and H 2 O , whereas its two products are D-glucose and acetate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-acetyl-D-glucose acetylhydrolase . This enzyme is also called 6-O-acetylglucose deacetylase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
