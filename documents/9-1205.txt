   Gammatone filter      Gammatone filter   (Figure)  Figure 1: A gammatone impulse response.   A gammatone filter is a linear filter described by an impulse response that is the product of a gamma distribution and sinusoidal tone. It is a widely used model of auditory filters in the auditory system .  The gammatone impulse response is given by        g   (  t  )    =   a   t   n  -  1     e   -   2  π  b  t      cos   (    2  π  f  t   +  ϕ   )      ,        g  t     a   superscript  t    n  1     superscript  e      2  π  b  t           2  π  f  t   ϕ       g(t)=at^{n-1}e^{-2\pi bt}\cos(2\pi ft+\phi),\,     where   f   f   f   (in Hz) is the center frequency,   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   (in radians ) is the phase of the carrier,   a   a   a   is the amplitude,   n   n   n   is the filter's order,   b   b   b   (in Hz) is the filter's bandwidth, and   t   t   t   (in seconds) is time.  This is a sinusoid (a pure tone ) with an amplitude envelope which is a scaled gamma distribution function. 1  Variations  Variations and improvements of the gammatone model of auditory filtering include the gammachirp filter, the all-pole and one-zero gammatone filters, the two-sided gammatone filter, and filter cascade models, and various level-dependent and dynamically nonlinear versions of these. 2  References  External links   Slaney's implementation in Mathematica  Cooke's implementation in C  A real-time implementation in C++ (for PureData)   "  Category:Auditory system  Category:Linear filters     ↩  ↩
