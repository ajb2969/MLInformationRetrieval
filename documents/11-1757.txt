Baskakov operator

In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, the Baskakov operators are generalizations of Bernstein polynomials, Szász–Mirakyan operators, and Lupas operators. They are defined by

There is an integer

They are named after V. A. Baskakov, who studied their convergence to bounded, continuous functions.1
Basic results
The Baskakov operators are linear and positive.2
