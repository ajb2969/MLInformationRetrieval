   Lawson criterion      Lawson criterion   In nuclear fusion research, the Lawson criterion , first derived on fusion reactors (initially classified) by John D. Lawson in 1955 and published in 1957, 1 is an important general measure of a system that defines the conditions needed for a fusion reactor to reach ignition , that is, that the heating of the plasma by the products of the fusion reactions is sufficient to maintain the temperature of the plasma against all losses without external power input. As originally formulated the Lawson criterion gives a minimum required value for the product of the plasma (electron) density n e and the "energy confinement time"    τ  E     subscript  τ  E    \tau_{E}   . Later analysis suggested that a more useful figure of merit is the "triple product" of density, confinement time, and plasma temperature T . The triple product also has a minimum required value, and the name "Lawson criterion" often refers to this inequality.  Energy Balance  The central concept of the Lawson criterion is the energy balance for any fusion power plant, using a hot plasma. This is shown below:  Net Power = Efficiency *(Fusion - Radiation Loss - Conduction Loss)   Net Power is the net power for any fusion power plant.  Efficiency how much energy is needed to drive the device and how well it collects power.  Fusion is rate of energy generated by the fusion reactions.  Radiation is the energy lost as light, leaving the plasma.  Conduction is the energy lost, as mass leaves the plasma.   Lawson calculates the fusion rate by assuming that any fusion reactor contains a hot plasma cloud which has a Gaussian curve of energy. Based on that assumption, he estimates the first term, the fusion energy coming from a hot cloud using the volumetric fusion equation. 2  Fusion = Number Density of Fuel A * Number Density of Fuel B * Cross Section(Temperature) * Energy Per Reaction   Fusion is the rate of fusion energy produced by the plasma  number density is the density of the respective fuels (or just one fuel, in some cases).  Cross Section is a measure of the probability of a fusion event, based on plasma temperature  Energy per reaction is the energy made in each fusion reaction   This equation is typically averaged over a population of ions which has a Normal distribution . For his analysis, Lawson ignores conduction losses. In reality this is nearly impossible, practically all systems lose energy through mass leaving. Lawson then estimated 3 the radiation losses using the equation below.       P  B   =    1.4  ⋅   10   -  34    ⋅   N  2   ⋅   T   1  /  2      W   cm  3          subscript  P  B      normal-⋅  1.4   superscript  10    34     superscript  N  2    superscript  T    1  2       normal-W   superscript  cm  3       P_{B}=1.4\cdot 10^{-34}\cdot N^{2}\cdot T^{1/2}\frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{cm}^{%
 3}}     where N is the number density of the cloud and T is the temperature.  Estimates  By equating radiation losses and the volumetric fusion rates Lawson estimates the minimum temperature for the fusion for the deuterium – tritium reaction        D   1  2    +  1  3   T    →  2  4     He   (    3.5   MeV   )     +  0  1    n   (    14.1   MeV   )         subscript   superscript  normal-→  4   2     subscript   superscript   3   1    superscript   subscript  normal-D  1   2   normal-T     subscript   superscript   1   0     He    3.5  MeV      normal-n    14.1  MeV       {}^{2}_{1}\mathrm{D}+\,^{3}_{1}\mathrm{T}\rightarrow\,^{4}_{2}\mathrm{He}\left%

 1.0\,\mathrm{MeV}\right)+\,^{1}_{1}\mathrm{p}\left(3.0\,\mathrm{MeV}\right)   to be 150 million degrees (12.9 keV). 4 5  Application to fusors and polywells  When applied to the fusor Lawson's analysis is used as an argument that conduction and radiation losses are the key impediment to reaching net power. Fusors uses a voltage drop to accelerate and collide ions, resulting in fusion. 6 The voltage drop is generated by wire cages, and these cages conduct away particles. Polywell are improvements on this design, designed to reduce conduction losses by removing the wire cages which cause them. 7 Regardless, it is argued that radiation is still a major impediment. 8  Extensions into nτ E  The confinement time     τ  E     subscript  τ  E    \tau_{E}   measures the rate at which a system loses energy to its environment. It is the energy density   W   W   W   (energy content per unit volume) divided by the power loss density    P  loss     subscript  P  loss    P_{\mathrm{loss}}   (rate of energy loss per unit volume):       τ  E   =   W   P  loss         subscript  τ  E     W   subscript  P  loss      \tau_{E}=\frac{W}{P_{\mathrm{loss}}}     For a fusion reactor to operate in steady state, the fusion plasma must be maintained at a constant temperature. Thermal energy must therefore be added to it (either directly by the fusion products or by recirculating some of the electricity generated by the reactor) at the same rate the plasma loses energy. The plasma loses energy through mass (conduction loss) or light (radiation loss) leaving the chamber.  For illustration, the Lawson criterion for the deuterium – tritium reaction will be derived here, but the same principle can be applied to other fusion fuels. It will also be assumed that all species have the same temperature, that there are no ions present other than fuel ions (no impurities and no helium ash), and that deuterium and tritium are present in the optimal 50-50 mixture. 9 Ion density then equals electron density and the energy density of both electrons and ions together is given by      W  =   3  n   k  B   T       W    3  n   subscript  k  normal-B   T     W=3nk_{\mathrm{B}}T     where    k  B     subscript  k  normal-B    k_{\mathrm{B}}   is the Boltzmann constant and   n   n   n   is the particle density.  The volume rate    f   f   f   (reactions per volume per time) of fusion reactions is      f  =    n  d    n  t    ⟨   σ  v   ⟩    =    1  4    n  2    ⟨   σ  v   ⟩          f     subscript  n  normal-d    subscript  n  normal-t    delimited-⟨⟩    σ  v              1  4    superscript  n  2    delimited-⟨⟩    σ  v        f=n_{\mathrm{d}}n_{\mathrm{t}}\langle\sigma v\rangle=\frac{1}{4}n^{2}\langle%
 \sigma v\rangle     where   σ   σ   \sigma   is the fusion cross section ,   v   v   v   is the relative velocity , and    ⟨  ⟩      \langle\rangle   denotes an average over the Maxwellian velocity distribution at the temperature   T   T   T   .  The volume rate of heating by fusion is   f   f   f   times    E  ch     subscript  E  ch    E_{\mathrm{ch}}   , the energy of the charged fusion products (the neutrons cannot help to heat the plasma). In the case of the deuterium – tritium reaction,     E  ch   =    3.5   MeV        subscript  E  ch     3.5  MeV     E_{\mathrm{ch}}=3.5\,\mathrm{MeV}   .  (Figure)  The Lawson criterion, or minimum value of (electron density * energy confinement time) required for self-heating, for three fusion reactions. For DT, nτ E minimizes near the temperature 25 keV (300 million kelvins).   The Lawson criterion requires that fusion heating exceeds the losses:       f   E  ch    ≥   P  loss         f   subscript  E  ch     subscript  P  loss     fE_{\rm ch}\geq P_{\rm loss}     Substituting in known quantities yields:        1  4    n  2    ⟨   σ  v   ⟩    E  ch    ≥    3  n   k  B   T    τ  E            1  4    superscript  n  2    delimited-⟨⟩    σ  v     subscript  E  ch        3  n   subscript  k  normal-B   T    subscript  τ  E      \frac{1}{4}n^{2}\langle\sigma v\rangle E_{\rm ch}\geq\frac{3nk_{\rm B}T}{\tau_%
 {E}}     Rearranging the equation produces: \,\frac{k_{\rm B}T}{\langle\sigma v\rangle} | 1 }}  The quantity    T  /   ⟨   σ  v   ⟩       T   delimited-⟨⟩    σ  v      T/\langle\sigma v\rangle   is a function of temperature with an absolute minimum. Replacing the function with its minimum value provides an absolute lower limit for the product    n   τ  E       n   subscript  τ  E     n\tau_{E}   . This is the Lawson criterion.  For the deuterium – tritium reaction, the physical value is at least       n   τ  E    ≥    1.5  ⋅   10  20     s   m  3           n   subscript  τ  E       normal-⋅  1.5   superscript  10  20      normal-s   superscript  normal-m  3       n\tau_{E}\geq 1.5\cdot 10^{20}\frac{\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{m}^{3}}     The minimum of the product occurs near    T  =    25   keV       T    25  keV     T=25\,\mathrm{keV}   .  Extension into the "triple product"  A still more useful figure of merit is the "triple product" of density, temperature, and confinement time, nTτ E . For most confinement concepts, whether inertial , mirror , or toroidal confinement, the density and temperature can be varied over a fairly wide range, but the maximum attainable pressure p is a constant. When such is the case, the fusion power density is proportional to p 2 / T 2 . The maximum fusion power available from a given machine is therefore reached at the temperature T where / T 2 is a maximum. By continuation of the above derivation, the following inequality is readily obtained:       n  T   τ  E    ≥      12   k  B     E  ch       T  2    ⟨   σ  v   ⟩           n  T   subscript  τ  normal-E          12   subscript  k  normal-B     subscript  E  ch       superscript  T  2    delimited-⟨⟩    σ  v        nT\tau_{\rm E}\geq\frac{12k_{\rm B}}{E_{\rm ch}}\,\frac{T^{2}}{\langle\sigma v\rangle}     (Figure)  The fusion triple product condition for three fusion reactions.   The quantity     T  2    ⟨   σ  v   ⟩        superscript  T  2    delimited-⟨⟩    σ  v      \frac{T^{2}}{\langle\sigma v\rangle}   is also a function of temperature with an absolute minimum at a slightly lower temperature than    T   ⟨   σ  v   ⟩       T   delimited-⟨⟩    σ  v      \frac{T}{\langle\sigma v\rangle}   .  For the deuterium – tritium reaction, the minimum of the triple product occurs at T = 14 keV. The average  in this temperature region can be approximated as 10        ⟨   σ  v   ⟩   =    1.1  ⋅   10   -  24       m  3   s      [    T    in   keV   ]   2      ,       delimited-⟨⟩    σ  v       normal-⋅  1.1   superscript  10    24        superscript  normal-m  3   normal-s    superscript   delimited-[]    T  in  keV    2      \left\langle\sigma v\right\rangle=1.1\cdot 10^{-24}\frac{{\rm m}^{3}}{\rm s}%
 \left[T{\rm\,in\,keV}\right]^{2}\,{\rm,}     so the minimum value of the triple product value at T = 14 keV is about         n  T   τ  E      ≥        12  ⋅   14  2   ⋅   keV  2       1.1  ⋅   10   -  24       m  3   s    14  2    ⋅  3500  ⋅  keV     ≈     3  ⋅   10  21    keV s   /   m  3             n  T   subscript  τ  E          normal-⋅  12   superscript  14  2    superscript  keV  2     normal-⋅     normal-⋅  1.1   superscript  10    24        superscript  normal-m  3   normal-s    superscript  14  2    3500  keV         normal-⋅  3   superscript  10  21    keV s    superscript  m  3        \begin{matrix}nT\tau_{E}&\geq&\frac{12\cdot 14^{2}\cdot{\rm keV}^{2}}{1.1\cdot

 \end{matrix}     This number has not yet been achieved in any reactor, although the latest generations of machines have come close. For instance, the TFTR has achieved the densities and energy lifetimes needed to achieve Lawson at the temperatures it can create, but it cannot create those temperatures at the same time. ITER aims to do both.  As for tokamaks there is an special motivation for using the triple product. Empirically, the energy confinement time τ E is found to be nearly proportional to n 1/3 / P 2/3 . In an ignited plasma near the optimum temperature, the heating power P equals fusion power and therefore is proportional to n 2 T 2 . The triple product scales as         n  T   τ  E      ∝     n  T   (    n   1  /  3    /   P   2  /  3     )           ∝     n  T   (    n   1  /  3    /    (    n  2    T  2    )    2  /  3     )           ∝     T   -   1  /  3             n  T   subscript  τ  E    proportional-to    n  T     superscript  n    1  3     superscript  P    2  3        absent  proportional-to    n  T     superscript  n    1  3     superscript     superscript  n  2    superscript  T  2      2  3        absent  proportional-to   superscript  T      1  3        \begin{matrix}nT\tau_{E}&\propto&nT\left(n^{1/3}/P^{2/3}\right)\\

 &\propto&T^{-1/3}\\
 \end{matrix}     The triple product is only weakly dependant on temperature as T -1/3 . This makes the triple product an adequate measure of the efficiency of the confinement scheme.  Inertial confinement  The Lawson criterion applies to inertial confinement fusion (ICF) as well as to magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) but is more usefully expressed in a different form. A good approximation for the inertial confinement time    τ  E     subscript  τ  E    \tau_{E}   is the time that it takes an ion to travel over a distance R at its thermal speed       v   t  h    =      k  B   T    m  i          subscript  v    t  h           subscript  k  normal-B   T    subscript  m  i       v_{th}=\sqrt{\frac{k_{\rm B}T}{m_{i}}}   where m i denotes mean ionic mass. The inertial confinement time    τ  E     subscript  τ  E    \tau_{E}   can thus be approximated as         τ  E     ≈      R   v   t  h                  =      R      k  B   T    m  i                   =      R  ⋅      m  i     k  B   T       .          subscript  τ  E      R   subscript  v    t  h       absent    absent     R         subscript  k  normal-B   T    subscript  m  i        absent    absent      normal-⋅  R       subscript  m  i      subscript  k  normal-B   T      .      \begin{matrix}\tau_{E}&\approx&\frac{R}{v_{th}}\\

 \end{matrix}   This product must be greater than a value related to the minimum of T 3/2 /. The same requirement is traditionally expressed in terms of mass density ρ = i>:       ρ  ⋅  R   ≥    1  g   /   cm  2         normal-⋅  ρ  R       1  normal-g    superscript  cm  2      \rho\cdot R\geq 1\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}     Satisfaction of this criterion at the density of solid deuterium – tritium (0.2 g/cm³) would require a laser pulse of implausibly large energy. Assuming the energy required scales with the mass of the fusion plasma ( E laser ~ ρR 3 ~ ρ −2 ), compressing the fuel to 10 3 or 10 4 times solid density would reduce the energy required by a factor of 10 6 or 10 8 , bringing it into a realistic range. With a compression by 10 3 , the compressed density will be 200 g/cm³, and the compressed radius can be as small as 0.05 mm. The radius of the fuel before compression would be 0.5 mm. The initial pellet will be perhaps twice as large since most of the mass will be ablated during the compression.  The fusion power density is a good figure of merit to determine the optimum temperature for magnetic confinement, but for inertial confinement the fractional burn-up of the fuel is probably more useful. The burn-up should be proportional to the specific reaction rate ( n 2 ) times the confinement time (which scales as T -1/2 ) divided by the particle density n :        burn-up fraction    ∝       n  2    ⟨   σ  v   ⟩    T   -   1  /  2      /  n          ∝       (   n  T   )    ⟨   σ  v   ⟩    /   T   3  /  2                burn-up fraction  proportional-to       superscript  n  2    delimited-⟨⟩    σ  v     superscript  T      1  2      n     absent  proportional-to        n  T    delimited-⟨⟩    σ  v      superscript  T    3  2       absent     \begin{matrix}\mbox{burn-up fraction }&\propto&n^{2}\langle\sigma v\rangle T^{%

The most difficult question is how to define   n   n   n   when the ion and electrons differ in density and temperature. Considering that this is a calculation of energy production and loss by ions, and that any plasma confinement concept must contain the pressure forces of the plasma, it seems appropriate to define the effective (electron) density   n   n   n   through the (total) pressure   p   p   p   as    n  =    p  /  2    T  i        n      p  2    subscript  T  normal-i      n=p/2T_{\mathrm{i}}   .

The values for    n  τ      n  τ    n\tau   ,    n  T  τ      n  T  τ    nT\tau   , and the power density must be multiplied by the factor      (   1  +     Z  1    T  e    /   T  i     )   ⋅   (   1  +     Z  2    T  e    /   T  i     )    /  4       normal-⋅    1       subscript  Z  1    subscript  T  normal-e     subscript  T  normal-i       1       subscript  Z  2    subscript  T  normal-e     subscript  T  normal-i      4    (1+Z_{1}T_{\mathrm{e}}/T_{\mathrm{i}})\cdot(1+Z_{2}T_{\mathrm{e}}/T_{\mathrm{i%
 }})/4   . For example, with protons and boron (    Z  =  5      Z  5    Z=5   ) as fuel, another factor of   3   3   3   must be included in the formulas. On the other hand, for cold electrons, the formulas must all be divided by   4   4   4   (with no additional factor for    Z  >  1      Z  1    Z>1   ). ↩  J.
