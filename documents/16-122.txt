   Beta-copaene synthase      Beta-copaene synthase   Beta-copaene synthase (, cop4 ) is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, beta-copaene-forming) . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    beta-copaene + diphosphate    This enzyme is isolated from the fungus  Coprinus cinereus .
