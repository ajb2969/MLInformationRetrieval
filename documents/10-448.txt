   Serine 2-dehydrogenase      Serine 2-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a serine 2-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-serine + H 2 O + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-hydroxypyruvate + NH 3 + NADH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-serine , H 2 O , and NAD + , whereas its 4 products are 3-hydroxypyruvate , NH 3 , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-serine:NAD+ 2-oxidoreductase (deaminating) . Other names in common use include L-serine:NAD+ oxidoreductase (deaminating) , and serine dehydrogenase .
