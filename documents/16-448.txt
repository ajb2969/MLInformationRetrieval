   Ribbon (mathematics)      Ribbon (mathematics)   In mathematics ( differential geometry ) by a ribbon (or strip)    (  X  ,  U  )     X  U    (X,U)   is meant a smooth space curve    X   X   X   given by a three-dimensional vector     X   (  s  )       X  s    X(s)   , depending continuously on the curve arc-length    s   s   s   (    a  ≤  s  ≤  b        a  s       b     a\leq s\leq b   ), together with a smoothly varying unit vector    U   (  s  )       U  s    U(s)   perpendicular to   X   X   X   at each point (Blaschke 1950).  The ribbon    (  X  ,  U  )     X  U    (X,U)   is called simple and closed if   X   X   X   is simple (i.e. without self-intersections) and closed and if   U   U   U   and all its derivatives agree at   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   . For any simple closed ribbon the curves    X  +   ε  U       X    ε  U     X+\varepsilon U   given parametrically by     X   (  s  )    +   ε  U   (  s  )          X  s     ε  U  s     X(s)+\varepsilon U(s)   are, for all sufficiently small positive   ε   ε   \varepsilon   , simple closed curves disjoint from   X   X   X   .  The ribbon concept plays an important role in the Cǎlugǎreǎnu-White-Fuller formula (Fuller 1971), that states that        L  k   =    W  r   +   T   w      ,        L  k       W  r     T  w      Lk=Wr+Tw\;,     where    L  k      L  k    Lk   is the asymptotic (Gauss) linking number (a topological quantity),    W  r      W  r    Wr   denotes the total writhing number (or simply writhe ) and    T  w      T  w    Tw   is the total twist number (or simply twist ).  Ribbon theory investigates geometric and topological aspects of a mathematical reference ribbon associated with physical and biological properties, such as those arising in topological fluid dynamics , DNA modeling and in material science .
