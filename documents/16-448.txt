Ribbon (mathematics)

In mathematics (differential geometry) by a ribbon (or strip) 
 
 
 
  is meant a smooth space curve

 
  given by a three-dimensional vector

 
 , depending continuously on the curve arc-length

 
  (
 
 
 
 ), together with a smoothly varying unit vector 
 
 
 
  perpendicular to 
 
 
 
  at each point (Blaschke 1950).
The ribbon 
 
 
 
  is called simple and closed if 
 
 
 
  is simple (i.e. without self-intersections) and closed and if 
 
 
 
  and all its derivatives agree at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . For any simple closed ribbon the curves 
 
 
 
  given parametrically by 
 
 
 
  are, for all sufficiently small positive 
 
 
 
 , simple closed curves disjoint from 
 
 
 
 .
The ribbon concept plays an important role in the Cǎlugǎreǎnu-White-Fuller formula (Fuller 1971), that states that



where 
 
 
 
  is the asymptotic (Gauss) linking number (a topological quantity), 
 
 
 
  denotes the total writhing number (or simply writhe) and 
 
 
 
  is the total twist number (or simply twist).
Ribbon theory investigates geometric and topological aspects of a mathematical reference ribbon associated with physical and biological properties, such as those arising in topological fluid dynamics, DNA modeling and in material science.
