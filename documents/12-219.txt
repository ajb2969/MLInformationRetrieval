   Acoplanarity      Acoplanarity   (Figure)  In the context of experiments involving quantum chromodynamics , acoplanarity can arise from the emission of gluons from the scattered final state particles.   In particle physics , the acoplanarity of a scattering experiment measures the degree to which the paths of the scattered particles deviate from being coplanar . Measurements of acoplanarity provide a test of perturbative  quantum chromodynamics , because QCD predicts that the emission of gluons can lead to acoplanar scattering events. 1  Measures of acoplanarity  For a two- jet final state, a useful measure of acoplanartiy is      φ  =   π  -   (    ϕ  2   -   ϕ  1    )        φ    π     subscript  ϕ  2    subscript  ϕ  1       \varphi=\pi-(\phi_{2}-\phi_{1})     where    ϕ  i     subscript  ϕ  i    \phi_{i}   are the azimuthal angles of the final state jets with respect to the beam line . 2 An alternative measure of acoplanarity which is infrared safe and which works for broad jets of many particles is given by      A  =  4  min    (     ∑  i    |   p   o  u  t   i   |      ∑  i    |   p  i   |     )   2      fragments  A   4    superscript   fragments  normal-(      subscript   i      superscript   subscript  p    o  u  t    i       subscript   i      subscript  p  i      normal-)   2     A=4\min{\left(\frac{\sum_{i}|p_{out}^{i}|}{\sum_{i}|p_{i}|}\right)^{2}}     where    p  i     subscript  p  i    p_{i}   are the momenta of the final state particles and    p   o  u  t   i     superscript   subscript  p    o  u  t    i    p_{out}^{i}   are the components of these momenta perpendicular to a plane chosen such that A is minimized. 3 In the case of two coplanar final state particles, the plane which minimizes A would contain the paths of both particles and the beamline, and A would equal 0.
