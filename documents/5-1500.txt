   Cryoscopic constant      Cryoscopic constant   In thermodynamics, the cryoscopic constant , K f , relates molality to freezing point depression . It is the ratio of the latter to the former:       △   T  f    =    K  f   ⋅  m  ⋅  i         normal-△   subscript  T  f     normal-⋅   subscript  K  f   m  i     \triangle T_{f}=K_{f}\cdot m\cdot i     i is the van 't Hoff factor , the number of particles the solute splits into or forms when dissolved.  Through cryoscopy , a known constant can be used to calculate an unknown molar mass . The term "cryoscopy" comes from Greek and means "freezing measurement." Freezing point depression is a colligative property , so    Δ  T      normal-Δ  T    \Delta T   depends only on the number of solute particles dissolved, not the nature of those particles. Cryoscopy is related to ebullioscopy , which determines the same value from the ebullioscopic constant (of boiling point elevation ).  The K f for water is 1.853 K ·kg/mol. 1  See also   List of boiling and freezing information of solvents  KF   References  "  Category:Phase transitions  Category:Thermodynamic properties     ↩
