   Lupanov representation      Lupanov representation   Lupanov's ( k , s )-representation , named after Oleg Lupanov , is a way of representing Boolean circuits so as to show that the reciprocal of the Shannon effect . Shannon had showed that almost all Boolean functions of n variables need a circuit of size at least 2 n n −1 . The reciprocal is that:   All Boolean functions of n variables can be computed with a circuit of at most 2 n n −1 + o(2 n n −1 ) gates.   Definition  The idea is to represent the values of a boolean function ƒ in a table of 2 k rows, representing the possible values of the k first variables x 1 , ..., , x k , and 2 n − k columns representing the values of the other variables.  Let A 1 , ..., A p be a partition of the rows of this table such that for i  i = s and     |   A  p   |   =   s  ′   ≤  s           subscript  A  p     superscript  s  normal-′        s     |A_{p}|=s^{\prime}\leq s   . Let ƒ i ( x ) = ƒ ( x ) iff  x ∈ A i .  Moreover, let    B   i  ,  w      subscript  B   i  w     B_{i,w}   be the set of the columns whose intersection with    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   is   w   w   w   .
