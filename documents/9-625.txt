   Generator (category theory)      Generator (category theory)   In category theory in mathematics a family of generators (or family of separators ) of a category    𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   is a collection    {    G  i   ∈   O  b   (  𝒞  )     |   i  ∈  I   }     conditional-set     subscript  G  i     O  b  𝒞      i  I     \{G_{i}\in Ob(\mathcal{C})|i\in I\}   of objects, indexed by some set I , such that for any two morphisms     f  ,  g   :   X  →  Y      normal-:   f  g    normal-→  X  Y     f,g:X\rightarrow Y   in   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   , if    f  ≠  g      f  g    f\neq g   then there is some i∈I and morphism    h  :    G  i   →  X      normal-:  h   normal-→   subscript  G  i   X     h:G_{i}\rightarrow X   , such that the compositions     f  ∘  h   ≠   g  ∘  h         f  h     g  h     f\circ h\neq g\circ h   . If the family consists of a single object G , we say it is a generator .  Generators are central to the definition of Grothendieck categories .  The dual concept is called a cogenerator or coseparator .  Examples   In the category of abelian groups , the group of integers   𝐙   𝐙   \mathbf{Z}   is a generator: If f and g are different, then there is an element    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   , such that     f   (  x  )    ≠   g   (  x  )          f  x     g  x     f(x)\neq g(x)   . Hence the map     𝐙  →  X   ,     normal-→  𝐙  X    \mathbf{Z}\rightarrow X,       n  ↦   n  ⋅  x      maps-to  n   normal-⋅  n  x     n\mapsto n\cdot x   suffices.  Similarly, the one-point set is a generator for the category of sets . In fact, any nonempty set is a generator.  In the category of sets, any set with at least two objects is a cogenerator.
