Generator (category theory)

In category theory in mathematics a family of generators (or family of separators) of a category

 
  is a collection 
 
 
 
  of objects, indexed by some set I, such that for any two morphisms 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 
 , if 
 
 
 
  then there is some iâˆˆI and morphism 
 
 
 
 , such that the compositions 
 
 
 
 . If the family consists of a single object G, we say it is a generator.
Generators are central to the definition of Grothendieck categories.
The dual concept is called a cogenerator or coseparator.
Examples

In the category of abelian groups, the group of integers 
 
 
 
  is a generator: If f and g are different, then there is an element 
 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
 . Hence the map 
 
 

 
  suffices.
Similarly, the one-point set is a generator for the category of sets. In fact, any nonempty set is a generator.
In the category of sets, any set with at least two objects is a cogenerator.
