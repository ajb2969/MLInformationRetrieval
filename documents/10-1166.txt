   Relative dimension      Relative dimension   In mathematics , specifically linear algebra and geometry , relative dimension is the dual notion to codimension .  In linear algebra, given a quotient map     V  →  Q     normal-→  V  Q    V\to Q   , the difference dim V − dim Q is the relative dimension; this equals the dimension of the kernel.  In fiber bundles , the relative dimension of the map is the dimension of the fiber.  More abstractly, the codimension of a map is the dimension of the cokernel , while the relative dimension of a map is the dimension of the kernel .  These are dual in that the inclusion of a subspace    V  →  W     normal-→  V  W    V\to W   of codimension k dualizes to yield a quotient map     W  *   →   V  *      normal-→   superscript  W     superscript  V      W^{*}\to V^{*}   of relative dimension k , and conversely.  The additivity of codimension under intersection corresponds to the additivity of relative dimension in a fiber product .  Just as codimension is mostly used for injective maps, relative dimension is mostly used for surjective maps.
