   Sauter mean diameter      Sauter mean diameter   In fluid dynamics , Sauter mean diameter ( SMD , d 32 or D [3, 2]) is an average of particle size. It was originally developed by German scientist Josef Sauter in the late 1920s. 1 2 It is defined as the diameter of a sphere that has the same volume / surface area ratio as a particle of interest. Several methods have been devised to obtain a good estimate of the SMD.  SMD is typically defined in terms of the surface diameter, d s :       d  s   =     A  p   π         subscript  d  s        subscript  A  p   π      d_{s}=\sqrt{\frac{A_{p}}{\pi}}     and volume diameter, d v :        d  v   =    (    6   V  p    π   )    1  /  3     ,       subscript  d  v    superscript      6   subscript  V  p    π     1  3      d_{v}=\left(\frac{6V_{p}}{\pi}\right)^{1/3},     where A p and V p are the surface area and volume of the particle, respectively. If d s and d v are measured directly by other means without knowledge of A p or V p , Sauter diameter for a given particle is        S  D   =   D   [  3  ,  2  ]    =   d  32   =    d  v  3    d  s  2     .          S  D     D   3  2          subscript  d  32           superscript   subscript  d  v   3    superscript   subscript  d  s   2       SD=D[3,2]=d_{32}=\frac{d_{v}^{3}}{d_{s}^{2}}.     If the actual surface area, A p and volume, V p of the particle are known the equation simplifies further:        V  p    A  p    =     4  3   π    (    d  v   /  2   )   3     4  π    (    d  s   /  2   )   2     =     (    d  v   /  2   )   3    3    (    d  s   /  2   )   2     =    d  32   6            subscript  V  p    subscript  A  p          4  3   π   superscript     subscript  d  v   2   3      4  π   superscript     subscript  d  s   2   2             superscript     subscript  d  v   2   3     3   superscript     subscript  d  s   2   2             subscript  d  32   6      \frac{V_{p}}{A_{p}}=\frac{\frac{4}{3}\pi(d_{v}/2)^{3}}{4\pi(d_{s}/2)^{2}}=%
 \frac{(d_{v}/2)^{3}}{3(d_{s}/2)^{2}}=\frac{d_{32}}{6}           d  32   =   6    V  p    A  p      .       subscript  d  32     6     subscript  V  p    subscript  A  p       d_{32}=6\frac{V_{p}}{A_{p}}.     This is usually taken as the mean of several measurements, to obtain the Sauter mean diameter, SMD:  This provides intrinsic data that help determine the particle size for fluid problems.  Applications  The SMD can be defined as the diameter of a drop having the same volume / surface area ratio as the entire spray.       D  s   =   1    ∑  i     f  i    d  i           subscript  D  s     1    subscript   i      subscript  f  i    subscript  d  i        D_{s}=\frac{1}{\sum_{i}\frac{f_{i}}{d_{i}}}           f  i     subscript  f  i    f_{i}   is the scalar variable for the dispersed phase      d  i     subscript  d  i    d_{i}   is the discrete bubble size     SMD is especially important in calculations where the active surface area is important. Such areas include catalysis and applications in fuel combustion.  See also   Sphericity   References  "  Category:Fluid dynamics     Sauter J.
