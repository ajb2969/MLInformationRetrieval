   Optical downconverter      Optical downconverter   Optical DownConverter ( ODC ) is an example of a non-linear optical process, in which two beams of light of different frequencies     ω  1     subscript  ω  1    \omega_{1}   and    ω  2     subscript  ω  2    \omega_{2}   interact, creating microwave with frequency     ω  3   =    ω  1   -   ω  2         subscript  ω  3      subscript  ω  1    subscript  ω  2      \omega_{3}=\omega_{1}-\omega_{2}   . It is a generalization of microwave . In the latter,     ω  1   =   ω  2        subscript  ω  1    subscript  ω  2     \omega_{1}=\omega_{2}   , both of which can be provided by a single light source. From a quantum mechanical perspective, ODC can be seen as result of deferencing two photons to produce a microwave. Since the energy of a photon is given by        E  ν   =   ℏ  ω    ,       subscript  E  ν     Planck-constant-over-2-pi  ω     E_{\nu}=\hbar\omega,     the frequency summing     ω  3   =    ω  1   -   ω  2         subscript  ω  3      subscript  ω  1    subscript  ω  2      \omega_{3}=\omega_{1}-\omega_{2}   is simply a statement that energy is conserved.  In a common ODC application, light from a tunable infrared  laser is combined with light from a fixed frequency visible laser to produce a microwave created by a wave mixing process.  The ODC use milimeteric microwave cavity that include photonic crystal that provide by two signal frequency light source. The microwave is detected by the cavity antenna.
