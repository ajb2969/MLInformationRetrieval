Dual object

In category theory, a branch of mathematics, it is possible to define a concept of dual object generalizing the concept of dual space in linear algebra.
A category in which each object has a dual is called autonomous or rigid.
Definition
Consider an object 
 
 
 
  in a monoidal category

 
 . The object 
 
 
 
  is called a left dual of 
 
 
 
  if there exist two morphsims


 
 , called the coevaluation, and 
 
 
 
 , called the evaluation, such that the following two diagrams commute

The object 
 
 
 
  is called the right dual of 
 
 
 
 . Left duals are canonically isomorphic when they exist, as are right duals. When C is braided (or symmetric), every left dual is also a right dual, and vice versa.
If we consider a monoidal category as a bicategory with one object, a dual pair is exactly an adjoint pair.
Categories with duals
A monoidal category where every object has a left (resp. right) dual is sometimes called a left (resp. right) autonomous category. Algebraic geometers call it a left (resp. right) rigid category. A monoidal category where every object has both a left and a right dual is called an autonomous category. An autonomous category that is also symmetric is called a compact closed category.
