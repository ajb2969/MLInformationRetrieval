   Fractional supersymmetry      Fractional supersymmetry   In theoretical physics , fractional supersymmetry is a generalization of the notion of supersymmetry in which the minimal positive amount of spin does not have to be    1  /  2      1  2    1/2   but can be an arbitrary    1  /  N      1  N    1/N   for integer value of N . Such a generalization is possible in two or less spacetime dimensions.
