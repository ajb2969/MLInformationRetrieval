Fractional supersymmetry

In theoretical physics, fractional supersymmetry is a generalization of the notion of supersymmetry in which the minimal positive amount of spin does not have to be 
 
 
 
  but can be an arbitrary 
 
 
 
  for integer value of N. Such a generalization is possible in two or less spacetime dimensions.
