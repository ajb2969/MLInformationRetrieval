   Network Effectiveness Ratio      Network Effectiveness Ratio   In telecommunications , the Network Effectiveness Ratio (NER) measures the ability of a network to deliver a call to the called terminal. Busy signals and other call failure due to user behaviour are counted as "successful call delivery" for NER calculation purposes. Unlike ASR , NER excludes the effects of customer and terminal behaviour. NER is a measure of network quality defined by the ITU . 1      N  E  R   =    100      A  n  s  w  e  r  e   d   C  a  l  l   s    +   U  s  e   r   B  u  s   y    +   R  i  n   g   N   o   A  n  s  w  e   r    +   T  e  r  m  i  n  a   l   R  e  j  e  c  t     S  e  i  z  u  r  e  s           N  E  R     100        A  n  s  w  e  r  e  d  C  a  l  l  s     U  s  e  r  B  u  s  y     R  i  n  g  N  o  A  n  s  w  e  r     T  e  r  m  i  n  a  l  R  e  j  e  c  t      S  e  i  z  u  r  e  s       NER=100\ \frac{Answered\ Calls\ +\ User\ Busy\ +\ Ring\ No\ Answer\ +\ %
