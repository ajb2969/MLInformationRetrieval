Zeaxanthin 7,8-dioxygenase

Zeaxanthin 7,8-dioxygenase (, zeaxanthin 7,8(7',8')-cleavage dioxygenase, CsZCD) is an enzyme with system name zeaxanthin:oxygen oxidoreductase (7,8-cleaving).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

zeaxanthin + 2 O2

crocetin dialdehyde + 2 (3S)-3-hydroxycyclocitral
 

Zeaxanthin 7,8-dioxygenase acts twice on zeaxanthin cleaving 3-hydroxycyclocitral off each 3-hydroxy end group.
