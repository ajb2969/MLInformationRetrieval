   Sticking coefficient      Sticking coefficient   Sticking coefficient is the term used in surface physics to describe the ratio of the number of adsorbate  atoms (or molecules ) that adsorb , or "stick", to a surface to the total number of atoms that impinge upon that surface during the same period of time . 1 Sometimes the symbol S c is used to denote this coefficient , and its value is between 1 (all impinging atoms stick) and 0 (no atoms stick). The coefficient is a function of surface temperature , surface coverage (θ) and structural details as well as the kinetic energy of the impinging particles.  Derivation  When arriving at a site of a surface, an adatom has three options. There is a probability that it will adsorb to the surface (    P  a     subscript  P  a    P_{a}   ), a probability that it will migrate to another site on the surface (    P  m     subscript  P  m    P_{m}   ), and a probability that it will desorb from the surface and return to the bulk gas (    P  d     subscript  P  d    P_{d}   ). For an empty site (θ=0) the sum of these three options is unity.        P  a   +   P  m   +   P  d    =  1         subscript  P  a    subscript  P  m    subscript  P  d    1    P_{a}+P_{m}+P_{d}=1     For a site already occupied by an adatom (θ>0), there is no probability of adsorbing, and so the probabilities sum as:        P  d  ′   +   P  m  ′    =  1         superscript   subscript  P  d   normal-′    superscript   subscript  P  m   normal-′    1    P_{d}^{\prime}+P_{m}^{\prime}=1     For the first site visited, the P of migrating overall is the P of migrating if the site is filled plus the P of migrating if the site is empty. The same is true for the P of desorption. The P of adsorption, however, does not exist for an already filled site.       P   m  1    =     P  m    (   1  -  θ   )    +    P  m  ′    (  θ  )          subscript  P    m  1         subscript  P  m     1  θ       superscript   subscript  P  m   normal-′   θ      P_{m1}=P_{m}(1-\theta)+P_{m}^{\prime}(\theta)          P   d  1    =     P  d    (   1  -  θ   )    +    P  d  ′    (  θ  )          subscript  P    d  1         subscript  P  d     1  θ       superscript   subscript  P  d   normal-′   θ      P_{d1}=P_{d}(1-\theta)+P_{d}^{\prime}(\theta)          P   a  1    =    P  m    (   1  -  θ   )         subscript  P    a  1       subscript  P  m     1  θ      P_{a1}=P_{m}(1-\theta)     The P of migrating from the second site is the P of migrating from the first site and then migrating from the second site, and so we multiply the two values.       P   m  2    =    P   m  1    ×   P   m  1     =   P   m  1   2          subscript  P    m  2       subscript  P    m  1     subscript  P    m  1           superscript   subscript  P    m  1    2      P_{m2}=P_{m1}\times P_{m1}=P_{m1}^{2}     Thus the sticking probability (    s  c     subscript  s  c    s_{c}   ) is the P of sticking of the first site, plus the P of migrating from the first site and then sticking to the second site, plus the P of migrating from the second site and then sticking at the third site etc.      s  =     P  a    (   1  -  θ   )    +    P   m  1     P  a    (   1  -  θ   )    +    P   m  1   2    P  a    (   1  -  θ   )   …        s       subscript  P  a     1  θ       subscript  P    m  1     subscript  P  a     1  θ       superscript   subscript  P    m  1    2    subscript  P  a     1  θ   normal-…      s=P_{a}(1-\theta)+P_{m1}P_{a}(1-\theta)+P_{m1}^{2}P_{a}(1-\theta)...         s  =    P  a    (   1  -  θ   )     ∑   n  =  0    \infin     P   m  1   n         s     subscript  P  a     1  θ     superscript   subscript     n  0    \infin    superscript   subscript  P    m  1    n       s=P_{a}(1-\theta)\sum_{n=0}^{\infin}P_{m1}^{n}     There is an identity we can make use of.        ∑   n  =  0    \infin     x  n    =    1   1  -  x     ∀  x    <  1          superscript   subscript     n  0    \infin    superscript  x  n        1    1  x     for-all  x         1     \sum_{n=0}^{\infin}x^{n}=\frac{1}{1-x}\forall x<1          ∴   s  =    P  a    (   1  -  θ   )    1   1  -   P   m  1           therefore  absent    s     subscript  P  a     1  θ     1    1   subscript  P    m  1          \therefore s=P_{a}(1-\theta)\frac{1}{1-P_{m1}}     The sticking coefficient when the coverage is zero    s  0     subscript  s  0    s_{0}   can be obtained by simply setting    θ  =  0      θ  0    \theta=0   . We also remember that       1  -   P   m  1     =    P  a   +   P  d          1   subscript  P    m  1        subscript  P  a    subscript  P  d      1-P_{m1}=P_{a}+P_{d}          s  0   =    P  a     P  a   +   P  d          subscript  s  0      subscript  P  a      subscript  P  a    subscript  P  d       s_{0}=\frac{P_{a}}{P_{a}+P_{d}}          s   s  0    =      P  a    (   1  -  θ   )     1  -   P   m  1         P  a   +   P  d     P  a           s   subscript  s  0           subscript  P  a     1  θ      1   subscript  P    m  1           subscript  P  a    subscript  P  d     subscript  P  a       \frac{s}{s_{0}}=\frac{P_{a}(1-\theta)}{1-P_{m1}}\frac{P_{a}+P_{d}}{P_{a}}     If we just look at the P of migration at the first site, we see that it is certainty minus all other possibilities.        P  m   1   =   1  -    P  d    (   1  -  θ   )    -    P  d  ′    (  θ  )    -    P  a    (   1  -  θ   )            subscript  P  m   1     1     subscript  P  d     1  θ       superscript   subscript  P  d   normal-′   θ      subscript  P  a     1  θ       P_{m}1=1-P_{d}(1-\theta)-P_{d}^{\prime}(\theta)-P_{a}(1-\theta)     Using this result, and rearranging, we find:       s   s  0    =    [   1  +     P  d  ′   θ     (    P  a   +   P  d    )    (   1  -  θ   )      ]    -  1          s   subscript  s  0     superscript   delimited-[]    1       superscript   subscript  P  d   normal-′   θ        subscript  P  a    subscript  P  d      1  θ         1      \frac{s}{s_{0}}=[1+\frac{P_{d}^{\prime}\theta}{(P_{a}+P_{d})(1-\theta)}]^{-1}          s   s  0    =    [   1  +    K  θ    1  -  θ     ]    -  1          s   subscript  s  0     superscript   delimited-[]    1      K  θ     1  θ        1      \frac{s}{s_{0}}=[1+\frac{K\theta}{1-\theta}]^{-1}         K   =    def      P  d  ′     P  a   +   P  d         K    def  absent        superscript   subscript  P  d   normal-′      subscript  P  a    subscript  P  d       K\overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=}\frac{P_{d}^{\prime}}{P_{a}+P_{d}}     References   King-Ning Tu, James W.
