   Time (Orders of magnitude)      Time (Orders of magnitude)   In the context of time , an order of magnitude is a description of the quantity of a time in respect to comparison between differing magnitudes . In common usage, the scale is usually the base 10 or base −10 exponent being applied to an amount, making the order of magnitude 10 times greater or smaller. 1 As the differences are measured in factors of 10, a logarithmic scale is applied. In terms of time, the relationship between the smallest limit of time, the Planck time, and the next order of magnitude larger is 10.

Rows in the table represent increasing powers of a thousand (3 orders of magnitude).  Conversion from year to second is year × 31 557 600 (approximately    π  *   10  7       π   superscript  10  7     \pi*10^{7}   ) using the Julian year . Conversion from     log  10   year      subscript   10   year    \log_{10}\mbox{ year}   to     log  10   second      subscript   10   second    \log_{10}\mbox{ second}   is approximately      log  10   year   +  7.50        subscript   10   year   7.50    \log_{10}\mbox{ year}+7.50   . Example conversion;     1  year   =    10  0   year   =    10   0  +  7.50    seconds   =    10   0.50  +  7    s   =    3.16  *   10  7    s           1  year      superscript  10  0   year           superscript  10    0  7.50    seconds           superscript  10    0.50  7    s            3.16   superscript  10  7    s      1\mbox{ year}=10^{0}\mbox{ year}=10^{0+7.50}\mbox{ seconds }=10^{0.50+7}s=3.16%
