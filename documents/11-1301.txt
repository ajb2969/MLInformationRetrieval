   Lactosylceramide beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase      Lactosylceramide beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase   In enzymology , a lactosylceramide beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-galactose + D-galactosyl-1,4-beta-D-glucosyl-R   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + D-galactosyl-1,3-beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-beta-D-glucosyl-R   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-galactose and D-galactosyl-1,4-beta-D-glucosyl-R , whereas its two products are UDP and D-galactosyl-1,3-beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-beta-D-glucosyl-R .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-galactose:D-galactosyl-1,4-beta-D-glucosyl-R beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphogalactose-lactosylceramide , and beta1->3-galactosyltransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
