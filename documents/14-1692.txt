   Reduced viscosity      Reduced viscosity   Reduced viscosity is equal to the ratio of the relative viscosity increment (    η  i     subscript  η  i    \eta_{i}   ) to the mass concentration of the polymer. 1 reduced viscosity     η  i   c       subscript  η  i   c    \frac{\eta_{i}}{c}   . The unit must be specified; mL/g is recommended. relative viscosity increment     η  i   =    η  -   η  s     η  s         subscript  η  i       η   subscript  η  s     subscript  η  s      \eta_{i}=\frac{\eta-\eta_{s}}{\eta_{s}}    see also relative viscosity , viscosity , intrinsic viscosity  "  Category:Viscosity     ↩
