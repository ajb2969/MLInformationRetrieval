Draft:Distributional calculus

In mathematics, distributional calculus is a generalized form of calculus that is based on the notion of distributions (generalized function), as opposed to classical calculus, which is based on functions. Its historical origin is calculus of variation and today it serves a foundation for such fields as the theory of partial differential equations and complex analytic geometry. Distributional calculus can give a rigorous meaning to the formal equations such as:



Examples
A distributional limit may still exist when the classical limit doesn't. Consider, for example, the function:


 
  Since, by integration by parts,


 
 , we have
 
 
 
 . That is, the limit of 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the distributional limit of 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 , if it exists. The distribution 
 
 
 
  is defined similarly.
One has



Let 
 
 
 
  be the rectangle with positive orientation, with an integer N. By the residue formula,


 
 . On the other hand,
