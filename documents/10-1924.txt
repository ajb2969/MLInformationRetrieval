   4-(2-carboxyphenyl)-2-oxobut-3-enoate aldolase      4-(2-carboxyphenyl)-2-oxobut-3-enoate aldolase   In enzymology , a 4-(2-carboxyphenyl)-2-oxobut-3-enoate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (3Z)-4-(2-carboxyphenyl)-2-oxobut-3-enoate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-formylbenzoate + pyruvate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (3Z)-4-(2-carboxyphenyl)-2-oxobut-3-enoate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 2-formylbenzoate and pyruvate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (3Z)-4-(2-carboxyphenyl)-2-oxobut-3-enoate 2-formylbenzoate-lyase (pyruvate-forming) . Other names in common use include 2'-carboxybenzalpyruvate aldolase , (3E)-4-(2-carboxyphenyl)-2-oxobut-3-enoate , 2-carboxybenzaldehyde-lyase , and (3Z)-4-(2-carboxyphenyl)-2-oxobut-3-enoate 2-formylbenzoate-lyase . This enzyme participates in naphthalene and anthracene degradation.  References     "  Category:EC 4.1.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
