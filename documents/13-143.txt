   Projectivization      Projectivization   In mathematics , projectivization is a procedure which associates with a non-zero vector space  V a projective space     ℙ   (  V  )       ℙ  V    {\mathbb{P}}(V)   , whose elements are one-dimensional subspaces of V . More generally, any subset S of V closed under scalar multiplication defines a subset of    ℙ   (  V  )       ℙ  V    {\mathbb{P}}(V)   formed by the lines contained in S and is called the projectivization of S .  Properties   Projectivization is a special case of the factorization by a group action : the projective space    ℙ   (  V  )       ℙ  V    {\mathbb{P}}(V)   is the quotient of the open set V \{0} of nonzero vectors by the action of the multiplicative group of the base field by scalar transformations. The dimension of    ℙ   (  V  )       ℙ  V    {\mathbb{P}}(V)   in the sense of algebraic geometry is one less than the dimension of the vector space V .    Projectivization is functorial with respect to injective linear maps: if         f  :   V  →  W      normal-:  f   normal-→  V  W     f:V\to W         is a linear map with trivial kernel then f defines an algebraic map of the corresponding projective spaces,           ℙ   (  f  )    :    ℙ   (  V  )    →   ℙ   (  W  )      .     normal-:    ℙ  f    normal-→    ℙ  V     ℙ  W      \mathbb{P}(f):\mathbb{P}(V)\to\mathbb{P}(W).         In particular, the general linear group GL( V ) acts on the projective space    ℙ   (  V  )       ℙ  V    {\mathbb{P}}(V)   by automorphisms .   Projective completion  A related procedure embeds a vector space V over a field  K into the projective space    ℙ   (   V  ⊕  K   )       ℙ   direct-sum  V  K     {\mathbb{P}}(V\oplus K)   of the same dimension. To every vector v of V , it associates the line spanned by the vector  of .  Generalization  In algebraic geometry , there is a procedure that associates a projective variety Proj S with a graded commutative algebra  S (under some technical restrictions on S ). If S is the algebra of polynomials on a vector space  V then Proj S is     ℙ   (  V  )    .      ℙ  V    {\mathbb{P}}(V).   This Proj construction gives rise to a contravariant functor from the category of graded commutative rings and surjective graded maps to the category of projective schemes .
