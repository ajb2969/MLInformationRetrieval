   Nearest centroid classifier      Nearest centroid classifier   (Figure)  Rocchio Classification   In machine learning , a nearest centroid or nearest prototype classifier is a classification model that assigns to observations the label of the class of training samples whose mean ( centroid ) is closest to the observation.  When applied to text classification using tf*idf vectors to represent documents, the nearest centroid classifier is known as the Rocchio classifier because of its similarity to the Rocchio algorithm for relevance feedback . 1  An extended version of the nearest centroid classifier has found applications in the medical domain, specifically classification of tumors . 2  Algorithm   Training procedure: given labeled training samples    {   (    x  →   1   ,   y  1   )   ,  …  ,   (    x  →   n   ,   y  n   )   }       subscript   normal-→  x   1    subscript  y  1    normal-…    subscript   normal-→  x   n    subscript  y  n      \textstyle\{(\vec{x}_{1},y_{1}),\dots,(\vec{x}_{n},y_{n})\}   with class labels     y  i   ∈  𝐘       subscript  y  i   𝐘    y_{i}\in\mathbf{Y}   , compute the per-class centroids      μ  l   →   =    1   |   C  l   |     ∑   i  ∈   C  l       x  →   i         normal-→   subscript  μ  l        1     subscript  C  l        i   subscript  C  l       subscript   normal-→  x   i      \textstyle\vec{\mu_{l}}=\frac{1}{|C_{l}|}\underset{i\in C_{l}}{\sum}\vec{x}_{i}   where    C  l     subscript  C  l    C_{l}   is the set of indices of samples belonging to class    l  ∈  𝐘      l  𝐘    l\in\mathbf{Y}   .  Prediction function: the class assigned to an observation    x  →     normal-→  x    \vec{x}   is     y  ^   =   arg    min   l  ∈  𝐘     ∥     μ  →   l   -   x  →    ∥          normal-^  y       subscript     l  𝐘     norm     subscript   normal-→  μ   l    normal-→  x         \hat{y}={\arg\min}_{l\in\mathbf{Y}}\|\vec{\mu}_{l}-\vec{x}\|   .
