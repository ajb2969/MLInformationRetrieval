   Finite thickness      Finite thickness   In formal language theory , in particular in algorithmic learning theory , a class C of languages has finite thickness if every string is contained in at most finitely many languages in C . This condition was introduced by Dana Angluin as a sufficient condition for C being identifiable in the limit . 1  The related notion of M-finite thickness  Given a language L and an indexed class C = { L 1 , L 2 , L 3 , ... } of languages, a member language L j ∈ C is called a minimal concept of L within C if L ⊆ L j , but not L ⊊ L i ⊆ L j for any L i ∈ C . 2 The class C is said to satisfy the MEF-condition if every finite subset D of a member language L i ∈ C has a minimal concept L j ⊆ L i . Symmetrically, C is said to satisfy the MFF-condition if every nonempty finite set D has at most finitely many minimal concepts in C . Finally, C is said to have M-finite thickness if it satisfies both the MEF- and the MFF-condition. 3  Finite thickness implies M-finite thickness. 4 However, there are classes that are of M-finite thickness but not of finite thickness (for example, any class of languages C = { L 1 , L 2 , L 3 , ... } such that L 1 ⊆ L 2 ⊆ L 3 ⊆ ...).
