2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-pentonate aldolase

In enzymology, a 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-pentonate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-pentonate 
 
 
 
  pyruvate + glycolaldehyde
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-pentonate, and two products, pyruvate and glycolaldehyde.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-pentonate glycolaldehyde-lyase (pyruvate-forming). Other names in common use include 2-keto-3-deoxy-L-pentonate aldolase, 2-keto-3-deoxy-L-arabonate aldolase, 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-xylonate aldolase, 3-deoxy-D-pentulosonic acid aldolase, and 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-pentonate glycolaldehyde-lyase. This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism.
