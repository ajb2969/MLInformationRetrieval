   DGTPase      DGTPase   In enzymology , a dGTPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dGTP + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   deoxyguanosine + triphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dGTP and H 2 O , whereas its two products are deoxyguanosine and triphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on triphosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dGTP triphosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include deoxy-GTPase , deoxyguanosine 5-triphosphate triphosphohydrolase , deoxyguanosine triphosphatase , and deoxyguanosine triphosphate triphosphohydrolase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
