   Degenerate bilinear form      Degenerate bilinear form   In mathematics , specifically linear algebra , a degenerate bilinear form on a vector space  V is a bilinear form such that the map from V to V ∗ (the dual space of V ) given by  is not an isomorphism . An equivalent definition when V is finite-dimensional is that it has a non-trivial kernel : there exist some non-zero x in V such that       f   (  x  ,  y  )    =   0         f   x  y    0    f(x,y)=0\,   for all     y  ∈  V   .      y  V    y\in V.     Non-degenerate forms  A nondegenerate or nonsingular form is one that is not degenerate, meaning that    v  ↦   (  x  ↦  f   (  x  ,  v  )   )      fragments  v  maps-to   fragments  normal-(  x  maps-to  f   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-,  v  normal-)   normal-)     v\mapsto(x\mapsto f(x,v))   is an isomorphism , or equivalently in finite dimensions, if and only if       f   (  x  ,  y  )    =   0         f   x  y    0    f(x,y)=0\,   for all    y  ∈  V      y  V    y\in V   implies that x = 0.  Using the determinant  If V is finite-dimensional then, relative to some basis for V , a bilinear form is degenerate if and only if the determinant of the associated matrix is zero – if and only if the matrix is singular, and accordingly degenerate forms are also called singular forms . Likewise, a nondegenerate form is one for which the associated matrix is non-singular , and accordingly nondegenerate forms are also referred to as non-singular forms . These statements are independent of the chosen basis.  Related notions  There is the closely related notion of a unimodular form and a perfect pairing ; these agree over fields but not over general rings.  Examples  The most important examples of nondegenerate forms are inner products and symplectic forms . Symmetric nondegenerate forms are important generalizations of inner products, in that often all that is required is that the map    V  →   V  *      normal-→  V   superscript  V      V\to V^{*}   be an isomorphism, not positivity. For example, a manifold with an inner product structure on its tangent spaces is a Riemannian manifold , while relaxing this to a symmetric nondegenerate form yields a pseudo-Riemannian manifold .  Infinite dimensions  Note that in an infinite dimensional space, we can have a bilinear form ƒ for which    v  ↦   (  x  ↦  f   (  x  ,  v  )   )      fragments  v  maps-to   fragments  normal-(  x  maps-to  f   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-,  v  normal-)   normal-)     v\mapsto(x\mapsto f(x,v))   is injective but not surjective . For example, on the space of continuous functions on a closed bounded interval, the form       f   (  ϕ  ,  ψ  )    =   ∫   ψ   (  x  )   ϕ   (  x  )   d  x          f   ϕ  ψ        ψ  x  ϕ  x  d  x      f(\phi,\psi)=\int\psi(x)\phi(x)dx   is not surjective: for instance, the Dirac delta functional is in the dual space but not of the required form. On the other hand, this bilinear form satisfies       f   (  ϕ  ,  ψ  )    =   0         f   ϕ  ψ    0    f(\phi,\psi)=0\,   for all    ϕ    ϕ   \,\phi   implies that    ψ  =   0.       ψ  0.    \psi=0.\,     Terminology  If ƒ vanishes identically on all vectors it is said to be ' totally degenerate '. Given any bilinear form ƒ on V the set of vectors      {   x  ∈  V   ∣    f   (  x  ,  y  )    =   0  for all  y   ∈  V   }     conditional-set    x  V         f   x  y      0  for all  y        V      \{x\in V\mid f(x,y)=0\mbox{ for all }y\in V\}     forms a totally degenerate subspace of V . The map ƒ is nondegenerate if and only if this subspace is trivial.  Sometimes the words anisotropic , isotropic and totally isotropic are used for nondegenerate, degenerate and totally degenerate respectively, although definitions of these latter words can vary slightly between authors.  Beware that a vector    x  ∈  V      x  V    x\in V   such that     f   (  x  ,  x  )    =  0        f   x  x    0    f(x,x)=0   is called isotropic for the quadratic form associated with the bilinear form   f   f   f   and the existence of isotropic lines does not imply that the form is degenerate.  pl:Forma dwuliniowa#Własności "  Category:Bilinear forms
