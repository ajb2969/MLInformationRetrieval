MRNA (nucleoside-2'-O-)-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a mRNA (nucleoside-2'-O-)-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + m7G(5')pppR-RNA 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + m7G(5')pppRm-RNA (mRNA containing a 2'-O-methylpurine cap)
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and m7G(5')pppR-RNA, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and m7G(5')pppRm-RNA (mRNA containing a 2'-O-methylpurine cap).
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:mRNA (nucleoside-2'-O-)-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include messenger ribonucleate nucleoside 2'-methyltransferase, and messenger RNA (nucleoside-2'-)-methyltransferase.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
