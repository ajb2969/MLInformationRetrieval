<h1>5 yen coin</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The  is one denomination of <a href="Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> <a class="uri" href="yen" title="wikilink">yen</a>. The current design was first minted in 1959 using Japanese characters known as the "<a href="Shinjitai" title="wikilink">new script</a>", and were also minted from 1949-1958 using <a href="Shinjitai" title="wikilink">"old-script" Japanese characters</a>. Five-yen coins date to 1870 (when, due to the much higher value of the yen, they were minted in <a class="uri" href="gold" title="wikilink">gold</a>). The modern-day coin was first produced in 1949 with a different styled inscription. This was changed in 1959 and the design has remained unchanged since.</p>

<p>The front of the coin depicts a <a class="uri" href="rice" title="wikilink">rice</a> plant growing out of the water, with "five yen" written in <a class="uri" href="kanji" title="wikilink">kanji</a>; the back is stamped with "Japan" and the year of issue, also in kanji, separated by sprouts of a tree. The three graphic elements of the coin represent agriculture and fisheries, the key elements of the Japanese first-sector economy. Around a hole, there is a <a class="uri" href="gear" title="wikilink">gear</a> that represents industry. It is the only Japanese coin in circulation to lack Arabic numerals on either face.</p>
<h2 id="cultural-significance">Cultural significance</h2>

<p>The Japanese for "five yen," <em>go en</em> (五円) is a <a class="uri" href="homophone" title="wikilink">homophone</a> with <em>go-en</em> (御縁), "en" being a word for causal connection or relationship, and "go" being a respectful prefix. As a result, five-yen coins are commonly given as donations at <a class="uri" href="Shinto" title="wikilink">Shinto</a> <a href="shrine" title="wikilink">shrines</a> with the intention of establishing a good connection with the deity of the shrine, and is widely believed it is best to insert a single five-yen coin into a new <a class="uri" href="wallet" title="wikilink">wallet</a> before inserting any other money.</p>
<h2 id="use-in-nuclear-accident-investigation">Use in nuclear accident investigation</h2>

<p>Following the <a href="Tokaimura_nuclear_accident" title="wikilink">nuclear accident</a> at <a href="Tokai,_Ibaraki" title="wikilink">Tokai, Ibaraki</a> in 1999, <a href="physicist" title="wikilink">physicists</a> <a href="Masuchika_Kohno" title="wikilink">Masuchika Kohno</a> and <a href="Yoshinobu_Koizumi" title="wikilink">Yoshinobu Koizumi</a> showed how this coin could be used to estimate <a class="uri" href="neutron" title="wikilink">neutron</a> dosage to the surrounding population, by measuring its <a class="uri" href="zinc" title="wikilink">zinc</a> <a class="uri" href="isotope" title="wikilink">isotope</a> ratios. They write:</p>

<dd>The Japanese 5-yen <a class="uri" href="coin" title="wikilink">coin</a> is about 22 millimeters in <a class="uri" href="diameter" title="wikilink">diameter</a> and 1.5 mm thick, weighs 3.75 <a href="gram" title="wikilink">grams</a> and has a central hole 5 mm wide. We chose this coin for monitoring neutron exposure because it is widely circulated, the <a class="uri" href="zinc" title="wikilink">zinc</a> content is precisely controlled, and the

To obtain a record of the dosage of neutrons released as a result of the accident, we collected exposed coins from people's houses at distances 100–550 m from the facility.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>

<p>They concluded that the coin could offer information about the total neutron effect during the accident, and about shielding by modern Japanese houses, given that the coins were recovered from indoors.</p>
