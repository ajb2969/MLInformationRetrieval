Goursat's lemma


Not to be confused with Goursat's integral lemma from Complex analysis


Goursat's lemma is an algebraic theorem about subgroups of the direct product of two groups.
It can be stated more generally in a Goursat variety (and consequently it also holds in any Maltsev variety), from which one recovers a more general version of Zassenhaus' butterfly lemma and in this form Goursat's theorem also implies the snake lemma.
Groups
Goursat's lemma for groups can be stated as follows.

Let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be groups, and let 
 
 
 
  be a subgroup of 
 
 
 
  such that the two projections

 
  and 
 
 
 
  are surjective (i.e., 
 
 
 
  is a subdirect product of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ). Let 
 
 
 
  be the kernel of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the kernel of 
 
 
 
 . One can identify 
 
 
 
  as a normal subgroup of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  as a normal subgroup of 
 
 
 
 . Then the image of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is the graph of an isomorphism

 
 .
 

An immediate consequence of this is that the subdirect product of two groups can be described as a fiber product and vice versa.
Proof
Before proceeding with the proof, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are shown to be normal in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively. It is in this sense that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  can be identified as normal in G and G', respectively.
Since 
 
 
 
  is a homomorphism, its kernel N is normal in H. Moreover, given 
 
 
 
 , there exists 
 
 
 
 , since 
 
 
 
  is surjective. Therefore, 
 
 
 
  is normal in G, viz:


 
 . It follows that 
 
 
 
  is normal in 
 
 
 
  since


 
 .
The proof that 
 
 
 
  is normal in 
 
 
 
  proceeds in a similar manner.
Given the identification of 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , we can write 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  instead of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . Similarly, we can write 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
On to the proof. Consider the map 
 
 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
 . The image of 
 
 
 
  under this map is 
 
 
 
 . This relation is the graph of a well-defined function 
 
 
 
  provided 
 
 
 
 , essentially an application of the vertical line test.
Since 
 
 
 
  (more properly, 
 
 
 
 ), we have 
 
 
 
 . Thus 
 
 
 
 , whence 
 
 
 
 , that is, 
 
 
 
 . Note that by symmetry, it is immediately clear that 
 
 
 
 , i.e., this function also passes the horizontal line test, and is therefore one-to-one. The fact that this function is a surjective group homomorphism follows directly.
Goursat varieties
As a consequence of Goursat's theorem, one can derive a very general version on the Jordan–Hölder–Schreier theorem in Goursat varieties.
