   Equivariant map      Equivariant map   In mathematics , an equivariant map is a function between two sets that commutes with the action of a group . Specifically, let G be a group and let X and Y be two associated G -sets . A function f : X → Y is said to be equivariant if   f ( g · x ) = g · f ( x )   for all g ∈ G and all x in X . Note that if one or both of the actions are right actions the equivariance condition must be suitably modified:   f ( x · g ) = f ( x )· g ; (right-right)  f ( x · g ) = g −1 · f ( x ) ; (right-left)  f ( g · x ) = f ( x )· g −1 ; (left-right)   Equivariant maps are homomorphisms in the category of G -sets (for a fixed G ). Hence they are also known as G -maps or G -homomorphisms . Isomorphisms of G -sets are simply bijective equivariant maps.  The equivariance condition can also be understood as the following commutative diagram . Note that    g  ⋅     fragments  g  normal-⋅    g\cdot   denotes the map that takes an element   z   z   z   and returns    g  ⋅  z     normal-⋅  g  z    g\cdot z   .  (Figure)  equivariant commutative diagram.png   Intertwiners  A completely analogous definition holds for the case of linear representations of G . Specifically, if X and Y are the representation spaces of two linear representations of G then a linear map  f : X → Y is called an intertwiner of the representations if it commutes with the action of G . Thus an intertwiner is an equivariant map in the special case of two linear representations/actions.  Alternatively, an intertwiner for representations of G over a field  K is the same thing as a module homomorphism of K [ G ]- modules , where K [ G ] is the group ring of G .  Under some conditions, if X and Y are both irreducible representations , then an intertwiner (other than the zero map ) only exists if the two representations are equivalent (that is, are isomorphic as modules ). That intertwiner is then unique up to a multiplicative factor (a non-zero scalar from K ). These properties hold when the image of K [ G ] is a simple algebra, with centre K (by what is called Schur's Lemma : see simple module ). As a consequence, in important cases the construction of an intertwiner is enough to show the representations are effectively the same.  Categorical description  Equivariant maps can be generalized to arbitrary categories in a straightforward manner. Every group G can be viewed as a category with a single object ( morphisms in this category are just the elements of G ). Given an arbitrary category C , a representation of G in the category C is a functor from G to C . Such a functor selects an object of C and a subgroup of automorphisms of that object. For example, a G -set is equivalent to a functor from G to the category of sets , Set , and a linear representation is equivalent to a functor to the category of vector spaces over a field, Vect K .  Given two representations, ρ and σ, of G in C , an equivariant map between those representations is simply a natural transformation from ρ to σ. Using natural transformations as morphisms, one can form the category of all representations of G in C . This is just the functor category  C G .  For another example, take C = Top , the category of topological spaces . A representation of G in Top is a topological space on which G acts continuously . An equivariant map is then a continuous map f : X → Y between representations which commutes with the action of G .  "  Category:Group actions  Category:Representation theory
