   L-ascorbate peroxidase      L-ascorbate peroxidase   In enzymology , a L-ascorbate peroxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-ascorbate + H 2 O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dehydroascorbate + 2 H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-ascorbate and H 2 O 2 , whereas its two products are dehydroascorbate and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a peroxide as acceptor (peroxidases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-ascorbate:hydrogen-peroxide oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include L-ascorbic acid peroxidase , L-ascorbic acid-specific peroxidase , ascorbate peroxidase , and ascorbic acid peroxidase . This enzyme participates in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 12 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , and .
