   Top-hat transform      Top-hat transform   In mathematical morphology and digital image processing , top-hat transform is an operation that extracts small elements and details from given images . There exist two types of top-hat transform: The white top-hat transform is defined as the difference between the input image and its opening by some structuring element ; The black top-hat transform is defined dually as the difference between the closing and the input image. Top-hat transforms are used for various image processing tasks, such as feature extraction , background equalization, image enhancement , and others.  Mathematical definitions  Let    f  :   E  ↦  R      normal-:  f   maps-to  E  R     f:E\mapsto R   be a grayscale image, mapping points from an Euclidean space or discrete grid  E (such as R 2 or Z 2 ) into the real line. Let    b   (  x  )       b  x    b(x)   be a grayscale structuring element.  Then, the white top-hat transform of f is given by:        T  w    (  f  )    =   f  -   f  ∘  b           subscript  T  w   f     f    f  b      T_{w}(f)=f-f\circ b   ,  where   ∘     \circ   denotes the opening operation.  The black top-hat transform of f (sometimes called the bottom-hat transform 1 ) is given by:        T  b    (  f  )    =    f  ∙  b   -  f          subscript  T  b   f      normal-∙  f  b   f     T_{b}(f)=f\bullet b-f   ,  where   ∙   normal-∙   \bullet   is the closing operation.  Properties  The white top-hat transform returns an image, containing those "objects" or "elements" of an input image that:   Are "smaller" than the structuring element (i.e., places where the structuring element does not fit in), and  are brighter than their surroundings.   The black top-hat returns an image, containing the "objects" or "elements" that:   Are "smaller" than the structuring element, and  are darker than their surroundings.   The size, or width, of the elements that are extracted by the top-hat transforms can be controlled by the choice of the structuring element   b   b   b   . The bigger the latter, the larger the elements extracted.  Both top-hat transforms are images that contain only non-negative values at all pixels.
