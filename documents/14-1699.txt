Dirichlet space

In mathematics, the Dirichlet space on the domain 
 
 
 
  (named after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet), is the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of holomorphic functions, contained within the Hardy space

 
 , for which the Dirichlet integral, defined by



is finite (here dA denotes the area Lebesgue measure on the complex plane 
 
 
 
 ). The latter is the integral occurring in Dirichlet's principle for harmonic functions. The Dirichlet integral defines a seminorm on 
 
 
 
 . It is not a norm in general, since 
 
 
 
  whenever f is a constant function.
For 
 
 
 
 , we define



This is a semi-inner product, and clearly 
 
 
 
 . We may equip 
 
 
 
  with an inner product given by



where 
 
 
 
  is the usual inner product on 
 
 
 
  The corresponding norm 
 
 
 
  is given by



Note that this definition is not unique, another common choice is to take 
 
 
 
 , for some fixed 
 
 
 
 .
The Dirichlet space is not an algebra, but the space 
 
 
 
  is a Banach algebra, with respect to the norm



We usually have 
 
 
 
  (the unit disk of the complex plane

 
 ), in that case 
 
 
 
 , and if



then



and



Clearly, 
 
 
 
  contains all the polynomials and, more generally, all functions 
 
 
 
 , holomorphic on 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is bounded on 
 
 
 
 .
The reproducing kernel of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
  is given by
