Mean squared prediction error

In statistics the mean squared prediction error of a smoothing or curve fitting procedure is the expected value of the squared difference between the fitted values 
 
 
 
  and the (unobservable) function g. If the smoothing procedure has operator matrix L, then



The MSPE can be decomposed into two terms (just like mean squared error is decomposed into bias and variance); however for MSPE one term is the sum of squared biases of the fitted values and another the sum of variances of the fitted values:



Note that knowledge of g is required in order to calculate MSPE exactly.
Estimation of MSPE
For the model 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 , one may write



The first term is equivalent to



Thus,



If 
 
 
 
  is known or well-estimated by 
 
 
 
 , it becomes possible to estimate MSPE by



Colin Mallows advocated this method in the construction of his model selection statistic Cp, which is a normalized version of the estimated MSPE:



where p comes from that fact that the number of parameters p estimated for a parametric smoother is given by 
 
 
 
 , and C is in honor of Cuthbert Daniel.
