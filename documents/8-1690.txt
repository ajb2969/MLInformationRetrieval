   Birch–Tate conjecture      Birch–Tate conjecture   The Birch–Tate conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics (more specifically in algebraic K-theory ) proposed by both Bryan John Birch and John Tate .  Statement  In algebraic K-theory, the group  K 2 is defined as the center of the Steinberg group of the ring of integers of a number field  F . K 2 is also known as the tame kernel of F . The Birch–Tate conjecture relates the order of this group (its number of elements) to the value of the Dedekind zeta function     ζ  F     subscript  ζ  F    \zeta_{F}   . More specifically, let F be a totally real number field and let N be the largest natural number such that the extension of F by the N th root of unity has an elementary abelian  2-group as its Galois group . Then the conjecture states that        #   K  2    =   |   N   ζ  F    (   -  1   )    |    .        normal-#   subscript  K  2        N   subscript  ζ  F     1       \#K_{2}=|N\zeta_{F}(-1)|.     Status  Progress on this conjecture has been made as a consequence of work on Iwasawa theory , and in particular of the proofs given for the so-called " main conjecture of Iwasawa theory ."  The problem remains unsolved as of 2011.  References   J. T. Tate, Symbols in Arithmetic , Actes, Congrès Intern.
