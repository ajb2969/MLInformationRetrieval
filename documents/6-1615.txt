Γ-convergence

In the calculus of variations, Γ-convergence (Gamma-convergence) is a notion of convergence for functionals. It was introduced by Ennio de Giorgi.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a topological space and 
 
 
 
  a sequence of functionals on 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  are said to 
 
 
 
 -converge to the 
 
 
 
 -limit 
 
 
 
  if the following two conditions hold:

Lower bound inequality: For every sequence 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 ,





Upper bound inequality: For every 
 
 
 
 , there is a sequence 
 
 
 
  converging to 
 
 
 
  such that




The first condition means that 
 
 
 
  provides an asymptotic common lower bound for the 
 
 
 
 . The second condition means that this lower bound is optimal.
Properties

Minimizers converge to minimizers: If 
 
 

 
 -converge to 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is a minimizer for 
 
 
 
 , then every cluster point of the sequence 
 
 
 
  is a minimizer of 
 
 
 
 .


 
 -limits are always lower semicontinuous.


 
 -convergence is stable under continuous perturbations: If 
 
 

 
 -converges to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is continuous, then 
 
 
 
  will 
 
 
 
 -converge to 
 
 
 
 .
A constant sequence of functionals 
 
 
 
  does not necessarily 
 
 
 
 -converge to 
 
 
 
 , but to the relaxation of 
 
 
 
 , the largest lower semicontinuous functional below 
 
 
 
 .

Applications
An important use for 
 
 
 
 -convergence is in homogenization theory. It can also be used to rigorously justify the passage from discrete to continuum theories for materials, for example, in elasticity theory.
