   Γ-convergence      Γ-convergence   In the calculus of variations , Γ-convergence ( Gamma-convergence ) is a notion of convergence for functionals . It was introduced by Ennio de Giorgi .  Definition  Let   X   X   X   be a topological space and     F  n   :   X  →   [  0  ,   +  ∞   )       normal-:   subscript  F  n    normal-→  X   0          F_{n}:X\to[0,+\infty)   a sequence of functionals on   X   X   X   . Then    F  n     subscript  F  n    F_{n}   are said to   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   -converge to the   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   -limit    F  :   X  →   [  0  ,   +  ∞   )       normal-:  F   normal-→  X   0          F:X\to[0,+\infty)   if the following two conditions hold:   Lower bound inequality: For every sequence     x  n   ∈  X       subscript  x  n   X    x_{n}\in X   such that     x  n   →  x     normal-→   subscript  x  n   x    x_{n}\to x   as    n  →   +  ∞      normal-→  n        n\to+\infty   ,         F   (  x  )    ≤    lim inf   n  →  ∞      F  n    (   x  n   )      .        F  x     subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n        subscript  F  n    subscript  x  n       F(x)\leq\liminf_{n\to\infty}F_{n}(x_{n}).      Upper bound inequality: For every    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   , there is a sequence    x  n     subscript  x  n    x_{n}   converging to   x   x   x   such that        F   (  x  )    ≥    lim sup   n  →  ∞      F  n    (   x  n   )           F  x     subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n        subscript  F  n    subscript  x  n       F(x)\geq\limsup_{n\to\infty}F_{n}(x_{n})     The first condition means that   F   F   F   provides an asymptotic common lower bound for the    F  n     subscript  F  n    F_{n}   . The second condition means that this lower bound is optimal.  Properties   Minimizers converge to minimizers: If    F  n     subscript  F  n    F_{n}      Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   -converge to   F   F   F   , and    x  n     subscript  x  n    x_{n}   is a minimizer for    F  n     subscript  F  n    F_{n}   , then every cluster point of the sequence    x  n     subscript  x  n    x_{n}   is a minimizer of   F   F   F   .     Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   -limits are always lower semicontinuous .     Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   -convergence is stable under continuous perturbations: If    F  n     subscript  F  n    F_{n}      Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   -converges to   F   F   F   and    G  :   X  →   [  0  ,   +  ∞   )       normal-:  G   normal-→  X   0          G:X\to[0,+\infty)   is continuous, then     F  n   +  G       subscript  F  n   G    F_{n}+G   will   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   -converge to    F  +  G      F  G    F+G   .  A constant sequence of functionals     F  n   =  F       subscript  F  n   F    F_{n}=F   does not necessarily   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   -converge to   F   F   F   , but to the relaxation of   F   F   F   , the largest lower semicontinuous functional below   F   F   F   .   Applications  An important use for   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   -convergence is in homogenization theory . It can also be used to rigorously justify the passage from discrete to continuum theories for materials, for example, in elasticity theory.  See also   Mosco convergence   References   A.
