Molybdopterin synthase




Molybdopterin synthase

Molybdopterin synthase (, MPT synthase) is an enzyme required to synthesize molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) from precursor Z (now known as cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate + 2 [molybdopterin-synthase sulfur-carrier protein]-Gly-NH-CH2-C(O)SH + H2O 
 
 
molybdopterin + 2 molybdopterin-synthase sulfur-carrier protein
 

It is heterodimeric and coded for by the MOCS2 gene.3
