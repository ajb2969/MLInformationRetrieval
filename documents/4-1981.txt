Pentagonal orthocupolarotunda

In geometry, the pentagonal orthocupolarotunda is one of the Johnson solids (J32). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by joining a pentagonal cupola (J5) and a pentagonal rotunda (J6) along their decagonal bases, matching the pentagonal faces. A 36-degree rotation of one of the halves before the joining yields a pentagonal gyrocupolarotunda (J33).
Formulae
The following formulae for volume and surface area can be used if all faces are regular, with edge length a:1
