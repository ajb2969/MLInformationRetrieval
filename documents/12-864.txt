   Lauricella's theorem      Lauricella's theorem   In the theory of orthogonal functions , Lauricella's theorem provides a condition for checking the closure of a set of orthogonal functions , namely:  Theorem. A necessary and sufficient condition that a normal orthogonal set    {   u  k   }      subscript  u  k     \{u_{k}\}   be closed is that the formal series for each function of a known closed normal orthogonal set    {   v  k   }      subscript  v  k     \{v_{k}\}   in terms of    {   u  k   }      subscript  u  k     \{u_{k}\}    converge in the mean to that function.  The theorem was proved by Giuseppe Lauricella in 1912.  References   G. Lauricella: Sulla chiusura dei sistemi di funzioni ortogonali , Rendiconti dei Lincei, Series 5, Vol. 21 (1912), pp. 675–85.
