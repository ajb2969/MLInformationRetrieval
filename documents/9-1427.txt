Lie algebra bundle

In Mathematics, a weak Lie algebra bundle



is a vector bundle

 
  over a base space X together with a morphism



which induces a Lie algebra structure on each fibre 
 
 
 
 .
A Lie algebra bundle

 
  is a vector bundle in which each fibre is a Lie algebra and for every x in X, there is an open set

 
  containing x, a Lie algebra L and a homeomorphism



such that



is a Lie algebra isomorphism.
Any Lie algebra bundle is a weak Lie algebra bundle but the converse need not be true in general.
As an example of a weak Lie algebra bundle that is not a strong Lie algebra bundle, consider the total space 
 
 
 
  over the real line 
 
 
 
 . Let [.,.] denote the Lie bracket of 

 and deform it by the real parameter as:


 
  for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Lie's third theorem states that every bundle of Lie algebras can locally be integrated to a bundle of Lie groups. However globally the total space might fail to be Hausdorff.1
