A Nichols plot.

The Nichols plot is a plot used in signal processing and  control design, named after American engineer Nathaniel B. Nichols.123
Use in  Control Design
Given a transfer function,



with the closed-loop transfer function defined as,



the Nichols plots displays 
 
 
 
  versus 
 
 
 
 . Loci of constant 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are overlaid to allow the designer to obtain the closed loop transfer function directly from the open loop transfer function. Thus, the frequency 
 
 
 
  is the parameter along the curve. This plot may be compared to the Bode plot in which the two inter-related graphs - 
 
 
 
  versus 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  versus 
 
 
 
 ) - are plotted.
In  feedback control design, the plot is useful for assessing the stability and robustness of a linear system. This application of the Nichols plot is central to the Quantitative feedback theory (QFT) of Horowitz and Sidi, which is a well known method for robust control system design.
In most cases, 
 
 
 
  refers to the phase of the system's response. Although similar to a Nyquist plot, a Nichols plot is plotted in a Cartesian coordinate system while a Nyquist plot is plotted in a polar coordinate system.
