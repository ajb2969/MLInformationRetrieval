   Inner measure      Inner measure   In mathematics , in particular in measure theory , an inner measure is a function on the set of all subsets of a given set, with values in the extended real numbers , satisfying some technical conditions. Intuitively, the inner measure of a set is a lower bound of the size of that set.  Definition  An inner measure is a function       φ  :    2  X   →   [  0  ,  ∞  ]     ,     normal-:  φ   normal-→   superscript  2  X    0       \varphi:2^{X}\rightarrow[0,\infty],   defined on all subsets of a set X , that satisfies the following conditions:   Null empty set: The empty set has zero inner measure ( see also: measure zero ).          φ   (  ∅  )    =  0        φ    0    \varphi(\varnothing)=0         Superadditive : For any disjoint sets A and B,           φ   (   A  ∪  B   )    ≥    φ   (  A  )    +   φ   (  B  )      .        φ    A  B        φ  A     φ  B      \varphi(A\cup B)\geq\varphi(A)+\varphi(B).         Limits of decreasing towers: For any sequence { A j } of sets such that     A  j   ⊇   A   j  +  1         subscript  A    j  1     subscript  A  j     A_{j}\supseteq A_{j+1}   for each j and     φ   (   A  1   )    <  ∞        φ   subscript  A  1       \varphi(A_{1})<\infty             φ   (    ⋂   j  =  1   ∞    A  j    )    =    lim   j  →  ∞     φ   (   A  j   )           φ    superscript   subscript     j  1       subscript  A  j       subscript    normal-→  j       φ   subscript  A  j       \varphi\left(\bigcap_{j=1}^{\infty}A_{j}\right)=\lim_{j\to\infty}\varphi(A_{j})         Infinity must be approached: If     φ   (  A  )    =  ∞        φ  A      \varphi(A)=\infty   for a set A then for every positive number c, there exists a B which is a subset of A such that,         c  ≤   φ   (  B  )    <  ∞        c    φ  B            c\leq\varphi(B)<\infty        The inner measure induced by a measure  Let Σ be a σ-algebra over a set X and μ be a measure on Σ . Then the inner measure μ * induced by μ is defined by         μ  *    (  T  )    =   sup   {   μ   (  S  )    :   S  ∈   Σ  and  S   ⊆  T   }     .         subscript  μ    T    supremum   conditional-set    μ  S       S    normal-Σ  and  S        T        \mu_{*}(T)=\sup\{\mu(S):S\in\Sigma\text{ and }S\subseteq T\}.     Essentially μ * gives a lower bound of the size of any set by ensuring it is at least as big as the μ -measure of any of its Σ -measurable subsets. Even though the set function μ * is usually not a measure, μ * shares the following properties with measures:  :# μ * (∅)=0,  :# μ * is non-negative,  :# If E ⊆ F then μ * ( E ) ≤ μ * ( F ).  Measure completion  Induced inner measures are often used in combination with outer measures to extend a measure to a larger σ-algebra. If μ is a finite measure defined on a σ-algebra  Σ over X and μ * and μ * are corresponding induced outer and inner measures, then the sets T ∈ 2 X such that μ * ( T ) = μ *( T ) form a σ-algebra    Σ  ^     normal-^  normal-Σ    \hat{\Sigma}   with    Σ  ⊆   Σ  ^       normal-Σ   normal-^  normal-Σ     \Sigma\subseteq\hat{\Sigma}   . 1 The set function μ̂ defined by        μ  ^    (  T  )    =    μ  *    (  T  )    =    μ  *    (  T  )             normal-^  μ   T      superscript  μ    T           subscript  μ    T      \hat{\mu}(T)=\mu^{*}(T)=\mu_{*}(T)   ,  for all    T  ∈   Σ  ^       T   normal-^  normal-Σ     T\in\hat{\Sigma}   is a measure on    Σ  ^     normal-^  normal-Σ    \hat{\Sigma}   known as the completion of μ .
