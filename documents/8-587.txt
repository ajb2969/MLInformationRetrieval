Inner measure

In mathematics, in particular in measure theory, an inner measure is a function on the set of all subsets of a given set, with values in the extended real numbers, satisfying some technical conditions. Intuitively, the inner measure of a set is a lower bound of the size of that set.
Definition
An inner measure is a function


 
  defined on all subsets of a set X, that satisfies the following conditions:

Null empty set: The empty set has zero inner measure (see also: measure zero).










Superadditive: For any disjoint sets A and B,










Limits of decreasing towers: For any sequence {Aj} of sets such that 
 
 
 
  for each j and 
 
 











Infinity must be approached: If 
 
 
 
  for a set A then for every positive number c, there exists a B which is a subset of A such that,









The inner measure induced by a measure
Let Σ be a σ-algebra over a set X and μ be a measure on Σ. Then the inner measure μ* induced by μ is defined by



Essentially μ* gives a lower bound of the size of any set by ensuring it is at least as big as the μ-measure of any of its Σ-measurable subsets. Even though the set function μ* is usually not a measure, μ* shares the following properties with measures:
:# μ*(∅)=0,
:# μ* is non-negative,
:# If E ⊆ F then μ*(E) ≤ μ*(F).
Measure completion
Induced inner measures are often used in combination with outer measures to extend a measure to a larger σ-algebra. If μ is a finite measure defined on a σ-algebra Σ over X and μ* and μ* are corresponding induced outer and inner measures, then the sets T ∈ 2X such that μ*(T) = μ*(T) form a σ-algebra
