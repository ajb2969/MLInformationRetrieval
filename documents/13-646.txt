   Continuity set      Continuity set   In measure theory , a continuity set of a measure  μ is any Borel set  B such that       μ   (   ∂  B   )    =  0 .        μ    B    0 .    \mu(\partial B)=0\,.     where    ∂  B      B    \partial B   is the boundary set of B . For signed measures , one asks that        |  μ  |    (   ∂  B   )    =  0 .          μ     B    0 .    |\mu|(\partial B)=0\,.     The class of all continuity sets for given measure μ forms a ring . 1  Similarly, for a random variable X a set B is called continuity set if        Pr   [   X  ∈   ∂  B    ]    =  0   ,       Pr    X    B     0    \Pr[X\in\partial B]=0,   otherwise B is called the discontinuity set . The collection of all discontinuity sets is sparse . In particular, given any collection of sets { B α } with pairwise disjoint boundaries, all but at most countably many of them will be the continuity sets. 2  The continuity set  C ( f ) of a function f is the set of points where f is continuous.
