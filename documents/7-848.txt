   Conductance quantum      Conductance quantum   The conductance quantum , denoted by the symbol is the quantized unit of electrical conductance . It is defined as:       G  0   =    2   e  2    h        subscript  G  0       2   superscript  e  2    h     G_{0}=\frac{2e^{2}}{h}   = . 1 It appears when measuring the conductance of a quantum point contact , and, more generally, is a key component of Landauer formula which relates the electrical conductance of a quantum conductor to its quantum properties. It is twice the reciprocal of the von Klitzing constant (2/ R K ).  Note that the conductance quantum does not mean that the conductance of any system must be an integer multiple of G 0 . Instead, it describes the conductance of two quantum channels (one channel for spin-up and one channel for spin-down) if the probability for transmitting an electron that enters the channel is unity, i.e. if transport through the channel is ballistic . If the transmission probability is less than unity, then the conductance of the channel is less than G 0 . The total conductance of a system is equal to the sum of the conductances of all the parallel quantum channels that make up the system. 2  Derivation  In a 1D wire adiabaticly connecting two reservoirs of potential u 1 and u 2 , the density of states is       d  n   /  d   ϵ   =    2  /  h   v             d  n   d   ϵ       2  h   v     dn/d\epsilon=2/hv   and the voltage is    V  =   -    (    u  1   -   u  2    )   /  e        V         subscript  u  1    subscript  u  2    e      V=-(u_{1}-u_{2})/e   . The 1D current going across is the current density    j  =   -     e  v   (    u  1   -   u  2    )   d  n   /  d   ϵ        j          e  v     subscript  u  1    subscript  u  2    d  n   d   ϵ      j=-ev(u_{1}-u_{2})dn/d\epsilon   .      G  =   I  /  V   =   j  /  V   =    2   e  2    /  h         G    I  V          j  V            2   superscript  e  2    h      G=I/V=j/V=2e^{2}/h     Occurrence  Quantized conductance occurs in wires that are ballistic conductors, when    λ  ≫  L     much-greater-than  λ  L    \lambda\gg L   . B. J.van Wees et al first observed the effect in a point contact in 1988. 3 Carbon nanotubes have quantized conductance independent of diameter. 4 The quantum hall effect can be used to precisely measure the conductance quantum value.  Motivation from the uncertainty principle  A simple, intuitive motivation of the conductance quantum can be made using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle , which states that the minimum energy-time uncertainty is ΔEΔt ~ h , where h is the Planck constant . The current I in a quantum channel can be expressed as e/τ , where τ is transit time and the e is electron charge . Applying a voltage V results in an energy E = eV . If we assume that the energy uncertainty is of order E and the time uncertainty is of order τ , we can write ΔEΔt ~ (eV)(e/I) ~ h . Using the fact that the electrical conductance G = I/V , this becomes G ~ e 2 /h .
