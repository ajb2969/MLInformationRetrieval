   Darwin–Radau equation      Darwin–Radau equation   In astrophysics , the Darwin–Radau equation gives an approximate relation between the moment of inertia factor of a planetary body and its rotational speed and shape. The moment of inertia factor is directly related to the largest principal moment of inertia , C . It is assumed that the rotating body is in hydrostatic equilibrium and is an ellipsoid of revolution . The Darwin–Radau equation states 1       C   M   R  e  2     =   2   3  λ    =    2  3    (   1  -    2  5     1  +  η      )            C    M   superscript   subscript  R  e   2       2    3  λ             2  3     1      2  5       1  η          \frac{C}{MR_{e}^{2}}=\frac{2}{3\lambda}=\frac{2}{3}\left(1-\frac{2}{5}\sqrt{1+%
 \eta}\right)     where M and R e represent the mass and mean equatorial radius of the body. Here λ is the d'Alembert parameter and the Radau parameter η is defined as      η  =     5  q    2  ϵ    -  2       η        5  q     2  ϵ    2     \eta=\frac{5q}{2\epsilon}-2     where q is the geodynamical constant      q  =     ω  2    R  e  3     G  M        q       superscript  ω  2    superscript   subscript  R  e   3      G  M      q=\frac{\omega^{2}R_{e}^{3}}{GM}     and ε is the geometrical flattening      ϵ  =     R  p   -   R  e     R  e        ϵ       subscript  R  p    subscript  R  e     subscript  R  e      \epsilon=\frac{R_{p}-R_{e}}{R_{e}}     where R p is the mean polar radius and R e is the mean equatorial radius.  For Earth ,    q  ≈   3.461391  ×   10   -  3         q    3.461391   superscript  10    3       q\approx 3.461391\times 10^{-3}   and    ϵ  ≈   1  /  298.257       ϵ    1  298.257     \epsilon\approx 1/298.257   , which yields     C   M   R  e  2     ≈  0.3313        C    M   superscript   subscript  R  e   2     0.3313    \frac{C}{MR_{e}^{2}}\approx 0.3313   , a good approximation to the measured value of 0.3307. 2  References  "  Category:Astrophysics  Category:Planetary science     ↩  ↩
