Darwin–Radau equation

In astrophysics, the Darwin–Radau equation gives an approximate relation between the moment of inertia factor of a planetary body and its rotational speed and shape. The moment of inertia factor is directly related to the largest principal moment of inertia, C. It is assumed that the rotating body is in hydrostatic equilibrium and is an ellipsoid of revolution. The Darwin–Radau equation states1



where M and Re represent the mass and mean equatorial radius of the body. Here λ is the d'Alembert parameter and the Radau parameter η is defined as



where q is the geodynamical constant



and ε is the geometrical flattening



where Rp is the mean polar radius and Re is the mean equatorial radius.
