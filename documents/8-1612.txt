   MASH-1      MASH-1   MASH-1 ( Modular Arithmetic Secure Hash ) is a hash function based on modular arithmetic .  History  Despite many proposals, few hash functions based on modular arithmetic have withstood attack, and most that have tend to be relatively inefficient. MASH-1 evolved from a long line of related proposals successively broken and repaired.  Standard  Committee Draft ISO/IEC 10118-4 (Nov 95)  Description  MASH-1 involves use of an RSA -like modulus M, whose bitlength affects the security. M should be difficult to factor , and for M of unknown factorization, the security is based in part on the difficulty of extracting modular roots. M also determines the block size for processing messages.  MASH-2  There is a new version of the algorithm called MASH-2 with a different exponent. The original    e  =  2      e  2    e=2   is replaced by    e  =    2  8   +  1       e     superscript  2  8   1     e=2^{8}+1   .  References   A. Menezes , P. van Oorschot, S.
