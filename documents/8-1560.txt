   Spread option      Spread option   In finance , a spread option is a type of option where the payoff is based on the difference in price between two underlying assets. For example the two assets could be crude oil and heating oil; trading such an option might be of interest to oil refineries, whose profits are a function of the difference between these two prices. Spread options are generally traded over the counter, rather than on exchange. 1 2  A 'spread option' is not the same as an 'option spread'. A spread option is a new, relatively rare type of exotic option on two underlyings, while an option spread is a combination trade: the purchase of one (vanilla) option and the sale of another option on the same underlying.  Spread option valuation  For a spread call, the payoff can be written as    C  =   max   (  0  ,    S  1   -   S  2   -  K   )        C    0     subscript  S  1    subscript  S  2   K      C=\max(0,S_{1}-S_{2}-K)   where S1 and S2 are the prices of the two assets and K is a constant called the strike price. For a spread put it is    P  =   max   (  0  ,    K  -   S  1    +   S  2    )        P    0      K   subscript  S  1     subscript  S  2       P=\max(0,K-S_{1}+S_{2})   .  When K equals zero a spread option is the same as an option to exchange one asset for another. An explicit solution, Margrabe's formula , is available in this case.  In 1995 Kirk's Approximation, 3 a formula valid when K is small but non-zero was published. This amounts to a modification of the standard Black-Scholes formula, with a special expression for the sigma (volatility) to be used, which is based on the volatilities and the correlation of the two assets.  The same year Pearson published an algorithm 4 requiring a single numerical integration to compute the option value.  This method was improved upon in 2006 when Li, Deng and Zhou 5 published accurate approximation formulas for both spread option prices and their Greeks.
