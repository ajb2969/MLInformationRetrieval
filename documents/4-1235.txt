   Relativistic Euler equations      Relativistic Euler equations   In fluid mechanics and astrophysics , the relativistic Euler equations are a generalization of the Euler equations that account for the effects of special relativity .  The equations of motion are contained in the continuity equation of the stress–energy tensor     T   μ  ν      superscript  T    μ  ν     T^{\mu\nu}   :        ∇  μ    T   μ  ν     =  0.        subscript  normal-∇  μ    superscript  T    μ  ν     0.    \nabla_{\mu}T^{\mu\nu}=0.   For a perfect fluid ,         T   μ  ν     =     (   e  +  p   )    u  μ    u  ν    +   p   η   μ  ν       .       superscript  T    μ  ν          e  p    superscript  u  μ    superscript  u  ν      p   superscript  η    μ  ν        T^{\mu\nu}\,=(e+p)u^{\mu}u^{\nu}+p\eta^{\mu\nu}.   Here   e   e   e   is the relativistic rest energy density of the fluid,   p   p   p   is the fluid pressure ,    u  μ     superscript  u  μ    u^{\mu}   is the four-velocity of the fluid, and    η   μ  ν      superscript  η    μ  ν     \eta^{\mu\nu}   is the Minkowski metric tensor with signature     (  -  ,  +  ,  +  ,  +  )           (-,+,+,+)   .  To the above equations, a statement of conservation is usually added, usually conservation of baryon number . If   n   n   n   is the number density of baryons this may be stated        ∇  μ    (   n   u  μ    )    =  0.        subscript  normal-∇  μ     n   superscript  u  μ     0.    \nabla_{\mu}(nu^{\mu})=0.     These equations reduce to the classical Euler equations if the fluid three-velocity is much less than the speed of light, the pressure is much less than the energy density , and the latter is dominated by the rest mass density.  The relativistic Euler equations may be applied to calculate the speed of sound in a fluid with a relativistic equation of state (that is, one in which the pressure is comparable with the internal energy density   e   e   e   , including the rest energy ;    e  =    ρ   c  2    +   ρ   e  C         e      ρ   superscript  c  2      ρ   superscript  e  C       e=\rho c^{2}+\rho e^{C}   where    e  C     superscript  e  C    e^{C}   is the classical internal energy per unit mass).  Under these circumstances, the speed of sound   S   S   S   is given by        S  2   =      c  2     ∂  p    ∂  e     |   adiabatic    .       superscript  S  2    evaluated-at     superscript  c  2       p     e     adiabatic     S^{2}=c^{2}\left.\frac{\partial p}{\partial e}\right|_{\rm adiabatic}.     (note that      e  =   ρ   (    c  2   +   e  C    )        e    ρ     superscript  c  2    superscript  e  C       e=\rho(c^{2}+e^{C})     is the relativistic internal energy density). This formula differs from the classical case in that   ρ   ρ   \rho   has been replaced by    e  /   c  2       e   superscript  c  2     e/c^{2}   .
