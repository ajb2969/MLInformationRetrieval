Glycerate kinase

In enzymology, a glycerate kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + (R)-glycerate 
 
 
 
  ADP + 3-phospho-(R)-glycerate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and (R)-glycerate, whereas its two products are ADP and 3-phospho-(R)-glycerate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:(R)-glycerate 3-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include glycerate kinase (phosphorylating), D-glycerate 3-kinase, D-glycerate kinase, glycerate-3-kinase, GK, D-glyceric acid kinase, and ATP:D-glycerate 2-phosphotransferase. This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: serine/glycine/threonine metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, and glyoxylate-dicarboxylate metabolism.
Structural studies
