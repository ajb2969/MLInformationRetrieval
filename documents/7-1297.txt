Link (geometry)

In geometry, the link of a vertex of a 2-dimensional simplicial complex is a graph that encodes information about the local structure of the complex at the vertex.
It is a graph-theoretic analog to a sphere centered at a point.
Example
  The link of a vertex of a tetrahedron is a triangle – the three vertices of the link corresponds to the three edges incident to the vertex, and the three edges of the link correspond to the faces incident to the vertex. In this example, the link can be visualized by cutting off the vertex with a plane; formally, intersecting the tetrahedron with a plane near the vertex – the resulting cross-section is the link.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a simplicial complex. The link

 
  of a vertex 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is the graph constructed as follows. The vertices of 
 
 
 
  correspond to edges of 
 
 
 
  which are incident to 
 
 
 
 . Two such edges are adjacent in 
 
 
 
  if they are incident to a common 2-cells at 
 
 
 
 . In general, for an abstract simplicial complex and a face 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , denoted 
 
 
 
  is the set of faces 
 
 
 
  such that G 
 
 
 
  F = 
 
 
 
  and G 
 
 
 
  F 
 
 
 
  X. Because 
 
 
 
  is simplicial, there is a set isomorphism between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that F 
 
 
 
 .
The graph 
 
 
 
  is often given the topology of a ball of small radius centred at 
 
 
 
 .
