   Link (geometry)      Link (geometry)   In geometry , the link of a vertex of a 2- dimensional  simplicial complex is a graph that encodes information about the local structure of the complex at the vertex.  It is a graph-theoretic analog to a sphere centered at a point.  Example  The link of a vertex of a tetrahedron is a triangle – the three vertices of the link corresponds to the three edges incident to the vertex, and the three edges of the link correspond to the faces incident to the vertex. In this example, the link can be visualized by cutting off the vertex with a plane; formally, intersecting the tetrahedron with a plane near the vertex – the resulting cross-section is the link.  Definition  Let   X   X   \scriptstyle X   be a simplicial complex. The link     Lk   (  v  ,  X  )      Lk  v  X    \scriptstyle\operatorname{Lk}(v,X)   of a vertex   v   v   \scriptstyle v   of   X   X   \scriptstyle X   is the graph constructed as follows. The vertices of    Lk   (  v  ,  X  )      Lk  v  X    \scriptstyle\operatorname{Lk}(v,X)   correspond to edges of   X   X   \scriptstyle X   which are incident to   v   v   \scriptstyle v   . Two such edges are adjacent in    Lk   (  v  ,  X  )      Lk  v  X    \scriptstyle\operatorname{Lk}(v,X)   if they are incident to a common 2-cells at   v   v   \scriptstyle v   . In general, for an abstract simplicial complex and a face   F   F   \scriptstyle F   of   X   X   \scriptstyle X   , denoted    Lk   (  F  ,  X  )      Lk  F  X    \scriptstyle\operatorname{Lk}(F,X)   is the set of faces   G   G   \scriptstyle G   such that G   ∩     \cap   F =   ∅     \emptyset   and G   ∪     \cup   F   ∈     \in   X. Because   X   X   X   is simplicial, there is a set isomorphism between    Lk   (  F  ,  X  )      Lk  F  X    \scriptstyle\operatorname{Lk}(F,X)   and     X  F   =   {  G  ∈  X      fragments   subscript  X  F     fragments  normal-{  G   X     X_{F}=\{G\in X   such that F    ⊂  G  }     fragments   G  normal-}    \subset G\}   .  The graph    Lk   (  v  ,  X  )      Lk  v  X    \scriptstyle\operatorname{Lk}(v,X)   is often given the topology of a ball of small radius centred at   v   v   \scriptstyle v   .
