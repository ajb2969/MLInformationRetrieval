   Axis–angle representation      Axis–angle representation   In mathematics, the axis–angle representation of a rotation parameterizes a rotation in a three-dimensional  Euclidean space by two values: a unit vector    ê   bold-ê   \mathbf{ê}   indicating the direction of an axis of rotation, and an angle    θ   θ   θ   describing the magnitude of the rotation about the axis. The rotation occurs in the sense prescribed by the right-hand rule . The rotation axis is sometimes called the Euler axis .  It is one of many rotation formalisms in three dimensions . The axis–angle representation is predicated on Euler's rotation theorem , which dictates that any rotation or sequence of rotations of a rigid body in a three-dimensional space is equivalent to a pure rotation about a single fixed axis.  Rotation vector  The axis–angle representation is equivalent to the more concise rotation vector , also called the Euler vector . In this case, both the rotation axis and the angle are represented by a vector codirectional with the rotation axis whose length is the rotation angle   θ   θ   θ   ,       𝐞  =   θ    𝐞  ^      .      𝐞    θ   normal-^  𝐞      \mathbf{e}=\theta\mathbf{\hat{e}}~{}.   It is used for the exponential and logarithm maps involving this representation.  Example  Say you are standing on the ground and you pick the direction of gravity to be the negative z direction. Then if you turn to your left, you will travel π /2 radians (or 90° ) about the z axis. Viewing the axis-angle representation as an ordered pair , this would be        (  axis  ,  angle  )   =   (   [      a  x        a  y        a  z      ]   ,  θ  )   =   (   [     0      0      1     ]   ,   π  2   )    .         axis  angle       subscript  a  x      subscript  a  y      subscript  a  z     θ           0    0    1      π  2       (\mathrm{axis},\mathrm{angle})=\left(\begin{bmatrix}a_{x}\\
 a_{y}\\
 a_{z}\end{bmatrix},\theta\right)=\left(\begin{bmatrix}0\\
 0\\
 1\end{bmatrix},\frac{\pi}{2}\right).     The above example can be represented as a rotation vector with a magnitude of    π  /  2      π  2    {π}/{2}   pointing in the   z   z   z   direction,       [     0      0        π  2       ]   .      0    0      π  2      \begin{bmatrix}0\\
 0\\
 \frac{\pi}{2}\end{bmatrix}.     Uses  The axis–angle representation is convenient when dealing with rigid body dynamics . It is useful to both characterize rotations , and also for converting between different representations of rigid body motion , such as homogeneous transformations and twists.  When a rigid body rotates around a fixed axis , its axis–angle data are a constant rotation axis and the rotation angle continuously dependent on time .  Rotating a vector  The Rodrigues' rotation formula , named after Olinde Rodrigues , is an efficient algorithm for rotating a Euclidean vector, given a rotation axis and an angle of rotation. In other words, the Rodrigues' formula provides an algorithm to compute the exponential map from    𝐬𝐨   (  3  )       𝐬𝐨  3    \mathbf{so}(3)   to    S  O   (  3  )       S  O  3    SO(3)   without computing the full matrix exponential.  If   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   is a vector in and   ω   ω   \mathbf{ω}   is a unit vector describing an axis of rotation about which   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   is rotated by an angle   θ   θ   θ   the Rodrigues' rotation formula to obtain the rotated vector is        𝐯  rot   =     (   cos  θ   )   𝐯   +    (   sin  θ   )    (   𝝎  ×  𝐯   )    +    (   1  -   cos  θ    )    (   𝝎  ⋅  𝐯   )    𝝎      .       subscript  𝐯  rot         θ   𝐯       θ     𝝎  𝐯        1    θ     normal-⋅  𝝎  𝐯   𝝎      \mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{rot}}=(\cos\theta)\mathbf{v}+(\sin\theta)(\boldsymbol{%
 \omega}\times\mathbf{v})+(1-\cos\theta)(\boldsymbol{\omega}\cdot\mathbf{v})%
 \boldsymbol{\omega}~{}.     For the rotation of a single vector it may be more efficient than converting   ω   ω   \mathbf{ω}   and   θ   θ   θ   into a rotation matrix to rotate the vector.  Relationship to other representations  There are several ways to represent a rotation. It is useful to understand how different representations relate to one another, and how to convert between them.  Exponential map from so(3) to SO(3)  The exponential map effects a transformation from the axis-angle representation of rotations to rotation matrices ,       exp  :    𝔰  𝔬   (  3  )    →   SO   (  3  )      .     normal-:    normal-→    𝔰  𝔬  3     SO  3      \exp\colon\mathfrak{so}(3)\to\mathrm{SO}(3)~{}.     Essentially, by using a Taylor expansion one derives a closed form relation between these two representations. Given a unit vector ω ∈    𝔰  𝔬      𝔰  𝔬    \mathfrak{so}   (3) = ℝ 3 representing the unit rotation axis, and an angle, θ ∈ ℝ, an equivalent rotation matrix R is given as follows, where K is the cross product matrix of ω .  That is, K v = ω × v for all vectors v ∈ ℝ 3 ,      R  =   exp   (   θ  𝐊   )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞      (   θ  𝐊   )   k    k  !     =   I  +   𝐊  θ   +    1   2  !      (   θ  𝐊   )   2    +    1   3  !      (   θ  𝐊   )   3    +  ⋯         R      θ  𝐊           superscript   subscript     k  0         superscript    θ  𝐊   k     k            I    𝐊  θ       1    2     superscript    θ  𝐊   2        1    3     superscript    θ  𝐊   3    normal-⋯      R=\exp(\theta\mathbf{K})=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(\theta\mathbf{K})^{k}}{k!}=%
 I+\mathbf{K}\theta+\frac{1}{2!}(\theta\mathbf{K})^{2}+\frac{1}{3!}(\theta%
 \mathbf{K})^{3}+\cdots     Because K is skew-symmetric, and the sum of the squares of its above-diagonal entries is 1, the characteristic polynomial    P   (  t  )       P  t    P(t)   of K is det( K − t  I ) {{=}} −( t 3 + t )}} . Since, by the Hamilton-Cayley theorem ,    P   (  𝐊  )       P  𝐊    P(\mathbf{K})   = 0, this implies that   – K }} .   As a result, K 4 = – K 2 , K 5 = K , K 6 = K 2 , K 7 = – K .  This cyclic pattern continues indefinitely, and so all higher powers of K can be expressed in terms of K and K 2 . Thus, from the above equation, it follows that       R  =   I  +    (     θ  -    θ  3    3  !     +    θ  5    5  !     -  ⋯   )   𝐊   +    (       θ  2    2  !    -    θ  4    4  !     +    θ  6    6  !     -  ⋯   )     𝐊  2       ,      R    I          θ     superscript  θ  3     3        superscript  θ  5     5     normal-⋯   𝐊              superscript  θ  2     2       superscript  θ  4     4        superscript  θ  6     6     normal-⋯    superscript  𝐊  2       R=I+\left(\theta-\frac{\theta^{3}}{3!}+\frac{\theta^{5}}{5!}-\cdots\right)%
 \mathbf{K}+\left(\frac{\theta^{2}}{2!}-\frac{\theta^{4}}{4!}+\frac{\theta^{6}}%
 {6!}-\cdots\right)\mathbf{K}^{2}~{},   that is,       R  =   I  +    sin   (  θ  )    𝐊   +    (   1  -   cos   (  θ  )     )    𝐊  2      .      R    I      θ   𝐊       1    θ     superscript  𝐊  2       R=I+\sin(\theta)\mathbf{K}+(1-\cos(\theta))\mathbf{K}^{2}.   This is a Lie-algebraic derivation, in contrast to the geometric one in the article Rodrigues' rotation formula . 1  Due to the existence of the above-mentioned exponential map, the unit vector ω representing the rotation axis, and the angle θ are sometimes called the exponential coordinates of the rotation matrix R .  Log map from SO(3) to so(3)  Let K continue to denote the 3×3 matrix that effects the cross product with the rotation axis ω : K ( v ) = ω × v for all vectors v in what follows.  To retrieve the axis–angle representation of a rotation matrix calculate the angle of rotation,      θ  =   arccos   (     trace   (  R  )    -  1   2   )        θ          trace  R   1   2      \theta=\arccos\left(\frac{\mathrm{trace}(R)-1}{2}\right)   and then use that to find the normalized axis,       ω  =    1   2   sin   (  θ  )        [       R   (  3  ,  2  )    -   R   (  2  ,  3  )           R   (  1  ,  3  )    -   R   (  3  ,  1  )           R   (  2  ,  1  )    -   R   (  1  ,  2  )        ]      .      ω      1    2    θ           R   3  2      R   2  3           R   1  3      R   3  1           R   2  1      R   1  2          \mathbf{\omega}=\frac{1}{2\sin(\theta)}\begin{bmatrix}R(3,2)-R(2,3)\\
 R(1,3)-R(3,1)\\
 R(2,1)-R(1,2)\end{bmatrix}~{}.     Note also that the Matrix logarithm of the rotation matrix R is      log  R  =   {     0       if   θ   =  0          θ   2   sin   (  θ  )        (   R  -   R  𝖳    )         if   θ   ≠    0    and   θ   ∈   (   -  π   ,  π  )           fragments   R    fragments  normal-{    0      if  θ   0         θ    2    θ       R   superscript  R  𝖳           if  θ     0  and  θ           π   π          \log R=\left\{\begin{matrix}0&\mathrm{if}\;\theta=0\\
 \frac{\theta}{2\sin(\theta)}(R-R^{\mathsf{T}})&\mathrm{if}\;\theta\neq 0\;%
 \mathrm{and}\;\theta\in(-\pi,\pi)\end{matrix}\right.     An exception occurs when R has eigenvalues equal to . In this case, the log is not unique. However, even in the case where θ=π the Frobenius norm of the log is         ∥   log   (  R  )    ∥   F   =    2    |  θ  |     .       subscript   norm    R    F       2     θ      \|\log(R)\|_{F}=\sqrt{2}|\theta|~{}.   Given rotation matrices A and B ,        d  g    (  A  ,  B  )    :=    ∥   log   (    A  𝖳   B   )    ∥   F      assign     subscript  d  g    A  B     subscript   norm       superscript  A  𝖳   B     F     d_{g}(A,B):=\|\log(A^{\mathsf{T}}B)\|_{F}   is the geodesic distance on the 3D manifold of rotation matrices.  For small rotations, the above computation of θ may be numerically imprecise as the derivative of arccos goes to infinity as θ →0. In that case, the off-axis terms will actually provide better information about θ since, for small angles,     R  ≈  I   +   θ  𝐊         R  normal-≈  I     θ  𝐊     R≈I+θ\mathbf{K}   . (This is because these are the first two terms of the Taylor series for exp( θ  K ).)  This formulation also has numerical problems at θ=π , where the off-axis terms don't give information about the rotation axis (which is still defined up to a sign ambiguity). In that case, we must reconsider the above formula.      R  =   I  +   𝐊   sin   (  θ  )     +    𝐊  2    (   1  -   cos   (  θ  )     )         R    I    𝐊    θ       superscript  𝐊  2     1    θ        R=I+\mathbf{K}\sin(\theta)+\mathbf{K}^{2}(1-\cos(\theta))   At θ=π , we have      R  =   I  +   2   𝐊  2     =   I  +   2   (    ω  ⊗  ω   -  I   )     =     2  ω   ⊗  ω   -  I         R    I    2   superscript  𝐊  2            I    2     tensor-product  ω  ω   I             tensor-product    2  ω   ω   I      R=I+2\mathbf{K}^{2}=I+2(\mathbf{\omega}\otimes\mathbf{\omega}-I)=2\mathbf{%
 \omega}\otimes\mathbf{\omega}-I   and so let       B  :=   ω  ⊗  ω   =    1  2    (   R  +  I   )     ,       assign  B   tensor-product  ω  ω            1  2     R  I       B:=\mathbf{\omega}\otimes\mathbf{\omega}=\frac{1}{2}(R+I)~{},   so the diagonal terms of B are the squares of the elements of ω and the signs (up to sign ambiguity) can be determined from the signs of the off-axis terms of B .  Unit quaternions  the following expression transforms axis–angle coordinates to versors (unit quaternions ):      Q  =   (   cos   (   θ  2   )    ,   ω   sin   (   θ  2   )     )       Q       θ  2      ω      θ  2        Q=\left(\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right),\mathbf{\omega}\sin\left(\frac{%
 \theta}{2}\right)\right)     Given a versor    q  =   s  +  𝐱       q    s  𝐱     q=s+\mathbf{x}   represented with its scalar  s and vector x , the axis–angle coordinates can be extracted using the following:      θ  =    2    arccos   (  s  )         θ    2    s      \theta=2\,\arccos(s)\,         ω  =   {        x   sin   (   θ  /  2   )      ,        if   θ   ≠  0        0  ,     otherwise         fragments  ω    fragments  normal-{      x      θ  2         if  θ   0     0  otherwise       \mathbf{\omega}=\left\{\begin{matrix}\frac{x}{\sin(\theta/2)},&\mathrm{if}\;%
 \theta\neq 0\\
 0,&\mathrm{otherwise}\end{matrix}\right.     A more numerically stable expression of the rotation angle uses the atan2 function:       θ  =    2    atan2   (   ∥  𝐱  ∥   ,  s  )      ,      θ    2   atan2   norm  𝐱   s      \theta=2\,\operatorname{atan2}(\|\mathbf{x}\|,s)\,,   where | x | is the Euclidean norm of the 3-vector x .
