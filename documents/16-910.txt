   Erdős–Nicolas number      Erdős–Nicolas number   In number theory , an Erdős–Nicolas number is a number that is not perfect , but for which there exists a number   m   m   m   such that         ∑   d  ∣  n  ,  d  ≤  m    d   =  n   .        subscript    fragments  d  normal-∣  n  normal-,  d   m    d   n    \sum_{d\mid n,\ d\leq m}d=n.    1  The first ten Erdős–Nicolas numbers are   24 , 2016, 8190, 42336, 45864, 392448, 714240, 1571328, 61900800 and 91963648.
