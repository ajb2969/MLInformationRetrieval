   Indiscernibles      Indiscernibles   In mathematical logic , indiscernibles are objects which cannot be distinguished by any property or relation defined by a formula . Usually only first-order formulas are considered.  Examples  If a , b , and c are distinct and { a , b , c } is a set of indiscernibles , then, for example, for each binary formula φ, we must have        [   φ   (  a  ,  b  )   and  φ   (  b  ,  a  )   and  φ   (  a  ,  c  )   and  φ   (  c  ,  a  )   and  φ   (  b  ,  c  )   and  φ   (  c  ,  b  )    ]    [   ¬  φ   (  a  ,  b  )   and  ¬  φ   (  b  ,  a  )   and  ¬  φ   (  a  ,  c  )   and  ¬  φ   (  c  ,  a  )   and  ¬  φ   (  b  ,  c  )   and  ¬  φ   (  c  ,  b  )    ]    .       delimited-[]    φ   a  b   italic- and  φ   b  a   italic- and  φ   a  c   italic- and  φ   c  a   italic- and  φ   b  c   italic- and  φ   c  b      delimited-[]     φ   a  b   italic- and   φ   b  a   italic- and   φ   a  c   italic- and   φ   c  a   italic- and   φ   b  c   italic- and   φ   c  b       [\varphi(a,b)\and\varphi(b,a)\and\varphi(a,c)\and\varphi(c,a)\and\varphi(b,c)%
 \and\varphi(c,b)][\lnot\varphi(a,b)\and\lnot\varphi(b,a)\and\lnot\varphi(a,c)%
 \and\lnot\varphi(c,a)\and\lnot\varphi(b,c)\and\lnot\varphi(c,b)]\,.     Historically, the identity of indiscernibles was one of the laws of thought of Gottfried Leibniz .  Generalizations  In some contexts one considers the more general notion of order-indiscernibles , and the term sequence of indiscernibles often refers implicitly to this weaker notion. In our example of binary formulas, to say that the triple ( a , b , c ) of distinct elements is a sequence of indiscernibles implies        (    [   φ   (  a  ,  b  )   and  φ   (  a  ,  c  )   and  φ   (  b  ,  c  )    ]    [   ¬  φ   (  a  ,  b  )   and  ¬  φ   (  a  ,  c  )   and  ¬  φ   (  b  ,  c  )    ]    )   and   (    [   φ   (  b  ,  a  )   and  φ   (  c  ,  a  )   and  φ   (  c  ,  b  )    ]    [   ¬  φ   (  b  ,  a  )   and  ¬  φ   (  c  ,  a  )   and  ¬  φ   (  c  ,  b  )    ]    )    .         delimited-[]    φ   a  b   italic- and  φ   a  c   italic- and  φ   b  c      delimited-[]     φ   a  b   italic- and   φ   a  c   italic- and   φ   b  c      italic- and     delimited-[]    φ   b  a   italic- and  φ   c  a   italic- and  φ   c  b      delimited-[]     φ   b  a   italic- and   φ   c  a   italic- and   φ   c  b        ([\varphi(a,b)\and\varphi(a,c)\and\varphi(b,c)][\lnot\varphi(a,b)\and\lnot%
 \varphi(a,c)\and\lnot\varphi(b,c)])\and([\varphi(b,a)\and\varphi(c,a)\and%
 \varphi(c,b)][\lnot\varphi(b,a)\and\lnot\varphi(c,a)\and\lnot\varphi(c,b)])\,.     Applications  Order-indiscernibles feature prominently in the theory of Ramsey cardinals , Erdős cardinals , and Zero sharp .  See also   Rough set   References     "  Category:Model theory
