   Empirical process      Empirical process   In probability theory , an empirical process is a stochastic process that describes the proportion of objects in a system in a given state. For a process in a discrete state space a population continuous time Markov chain 1 2 or Markov population model 3 is a process which counts the number of objects in a given state (without rescaling). In mean field theory , limit theorems (as the number of objects becomes large) are considered and generalise the central limit theorem for empirical measures . Applications of the theory of empirical processes arise in non-parametric statistics . 4  Definition  For X 1 , X 2 , ... X n  independent and identically-distributed random variables in R with common cumulative distribution function  F ( x ), the empirical distribution function is defined by         F  n    (  x  )    =    1  n     ∑   i  =  1   n     I   (   -  ∞   ,  x  ]     (   X  i   )       ,         subscript  F  n   x       1  n     superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  I       x     subscript  X  i        F_{n}(x)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}I_{(-\infty,x]}(X_{i}),   where I C is the indicator function of the set C .  For every (fixed) x , F n ( x ) is a sequence of random variables which converge to F ( x ) almost surely by the strong law of large numbers . That is, F n converges to F  pointwise . Glivenko and Cantelli strengthened this result by proving uniform convergence of F n to F by the Glivenko–Cantelli theorem . 5  A centered and scaled version of the empirical measure is the signed measure        G  n    (  A  )    =    n    (     P  n    (  A  )    -   P   (  A  )     )           subscript  G  n   A       n        subscript  P  n   A     P  A       G_{n}(A)=\sqrt{n}(P_{n}(A)-P(A))   It induces a map on measurable functions f given by      f  ↦    G  n   f   =    n    (    P  n   -  P   )   f   =    n    (     1  n     ∑   i  =  1   n    f   (   X  i   )      -   𝔼  f    )         maps-to  f     subscript  G  n   f            n      subscript  P  n   P   f            n         1  n     superscript   subscript     i  1    n     f   subscript  X  i        𝔼  f        f\mapsto G_{n}f=\sqrt{n}(P_{n}-P)f=\sqrt{n}\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(X_%
 {i})-\mathbb{E}f\right)     By the central limit theorem ,     G  n    (  A  )        subscript  G  n   A    G_{n}(A)    converges in distribution to a normal random variable N (0, P ( A )(1 − P ( A ))) for fixed measurable set A . Similarly, for a fixed function f ,     G  n   f       subscript  G  n   f    G_{n}f   converges in distribution to a normal random variable    N   (  0  ,   𝔼    (   f  -   𝔼  f    )   2    )       N   0    𝔼   superscript    f    𝔼  f    2       N(0,\mathbb{E}(f-\mathbb{E}f)^{2})   , provided that    𝔼  f      𝔼  f    \mathbb{E}f   and    𝔼   f  2       𝔼   superscript  f  2     \mathbb{E}f^{2}   exist.  Definition       (    G  n    (  c  )    )    c  ∈  𝒞      subscript     subscript  G  n   c     c  𝒞     \bigl(G_{n}(c)\bigr)_{c\in\mathcal{C}}   is called an empirical process indexed by   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   , a collection of measurable subsets of S .       (    G  n   f   )    f  ∈  ℱ      subscript     subscript  G  n   f     f  ℱ     \bigl(G_{n}f\bigr)_{f\in\mathcal{F}}   is called an empirical process indexed by   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   , a collection of measurable functions from S to   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   .  A significant result in the area of empirical processes is Donsker's theorem . It has led to a study of Donsker classes : sets of functions with the useful property that empirical processes indexed by these classes converge weakly to a certain Gaussian process . While it can be shown that Donsker classes are Glivenko–Cantelli classes , the converse is not true in general.  Example  As an example, consider empirical distribution functions . For real-valued iid random variables X 1 , X 2 , ..., X n they are given by         F  n    (  x  )    =    P  n    (   (   -  ∞   ,  x  ]   )    =    P  n    I   (   -  ∞   ,  x  ]      .           subscript  F  n   x      subscript  P  n        x            subscript  P  n    subscript  I       x        F_{n}(x)=P_{n}((-\infty,x])=P_{n}I_{(-\infty,x]}.     In this case, empirical processes are indexed by a class     𝒞  =   {   (   -  ∞   ,  x  ]   :   x  ∈  ℝ   }    .      𝒞   conditional-set       x     x  ℝ      \mathcal{C}=\{(-\infty,x]:x\in\mathbb{R}\}.   It has been shown that   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   is a Donsker class, in particular,       n    (     F  n    (  x  )    -   F   (  x  )     )         n        subscript  F  n   x     F  x      \sqrt{n}(F_{n}(x)-F(x))   converges weakly in     ℓ  ∞    (  ℝ  )        superscript  normal-ℓ    ℝ    \ell^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})   to a Brownian bridge  B ( F ( x )) .
