Topology of uniform convergence

In mathematics, a linear map is a mapping

 
  between two modules (including vector spaces) that preserves the operations of addition and scalar multiplication.
By studying the linear maps between two modules one can gain insight into their structures. If the modules have additional structure, like topologies or bornologies, then one can study the subspace of linear maps that preserve this structure.
Topologies of uniform convergence
Suppose that T be any set and that 
 
 
 
  be collection of subsets of T directed by inclusion. Suppose in addition that Y is a topological vector space (not necessarily Hausdorff or locally convex) and that 
 
 
 
  is a basis of neighborhoods of 0 in Y. Then the set of all functions from T into Y, 
 
 
 
 , can be given a unique translation-invariant topology by defining a basis of neighborhoods of 0 in 
 
 
 
 , to be


 
  as G and N range over all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . This topology does not depend on the basis 
 
 
 
  that was chosen and it is known as the topology of uniform convergence on the sets in 
 
 
 or as the 

 
 -topology.1 In practice, 
 
 
 
  usually consists of a collection of sets with certain properties and this name is changed appropriately to reflect this set so that if, for instance, 
 
 
 
  is the collection of compact subsets of T (and T is a topological space), then this topology is called the topology of uniform convergence on the compact subsets of T. A set 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is said to be fundamental with respect to 
 
 
 if each 
 
 
 
  is a subset of some element in 
 
 
 
 . In this case, the collection 
 
 
 
  can be replaced by 
 
 
 
  without changing the topology on 
 
 
 
 .2
However, the 
 
 
 
 -topology on 
 
 
 
  is not necessarily compatible with the vector space structure of 
 
 
 
  or of any of its vector subspaces (that is, it is not necessarily a topological vector space topology on 
 
 
 
 ). Suppose that F is a vector subspace 
 
 
 
  so that it inherits the subspace topology from 
 
 
 
 . Then the 
 
 
 
 -topology on F is compatible with the vector space structure of F if and only if for every 
 
 
 
  and every f ∈ F, f(G) is bounded in Y.3
If Y is locally convex then so is the 
 
 
 
 -topology on 
 
 
 
  and if 
 
 
 
  is a family of continuous seminorms generating this topology on Y then the 
 
 
 
 -topology is induced by the following family of seminorms
 
 
 
 , as G varies over 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  varies over all indices.4 If Y is Hausdorff and T is a topological space such that 
 
 
 
  is dense in T then the 
 
 
 
 -topology on subspace of 
 
 
 
  consisting of all continuous maps is Hausdorff. If the topological space T is also a topological vector space, then the condition that 
 
 
 
  be dense in T can be replaced by the weaker condition that the linear span of this set be dense in T, in which case we say that this set is total in T.5
Let H be a subset of 
 
 
 
 . Then H is bounded in the 
 
 
 
 -topology if and only if for every 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is bounded in Y.6
Spaces of continuous linear maps
Throughout this section we will assume that X and Y are topological vector spaces and we will let L(X, Y), denote the vector space of all continuous linear maps from X and Y. If L(X, Y) if given the 
 
 
 
 -topology inherited from 
 
 
 
  then this space with this topology is denoted by 
 
 
 
 . The 
 
 
 
 -topology on L(X, Y) is compatible with the vector space structure of L(X, Y) if and only if for all 
 
 
 
  and all f ∈ L(X, Y) the set f(G) is bounded in Y, which we will assume to be the case for the rest of the article. Note in particular that this is the case if 
 
 
 
  consists of (von-Neumann) bounded subsets of X.
Often, 
 
 
 
  is required to satisfy the following two axioms:






 
 :

If 
 
 
 
  then there exists a 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .





 
 :

If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a scalar then there exists a 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .



If 
 
 
 
  is a bornology on X. which is often the case, then these two axioms are satisfied.
Properties
Completeness
For the following theorems, suppose that X is a topological vector space and Y is a locally convex Hausdorff spaces and 
 
 
 
  is a collection of bounded subsets of X that satisfies axioms 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and forms a covering of X.



 
  is complete if


If X is a Mackey space then 
 
 
 
  is complete if and only if both 
 
 
 
  and Y are complete.
If X is barrelled then 
 
 
 
  is Hausdorff and quasi-complete, which means that every closed and bounded set is complete.

Boundedness
Let X and Y be topological vector space and H be a subset of L(X, Y). Then the following are equivalent:7

H is bounded in 
 
 
 
 ,
For every 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is bounded in Y,
For every neighborhood of 0, V, in Y the set 
 
 
 
  absorbs every 
 
 
 
 .

Furthermore,

If X and Y are locally convex Hausdorff space and if H is bounded in 
 
 
 
  (i.e. pointwise bounded or simply bounded) then it is bounded in the topology of uniform convergence on the convex, balanced, bounded, complete subsets of X.8
If X and Y are locally convex Hausdorff spaces and if X is quasi-complete (i.e. closed and bounded subsets are complete), then the bounded subsets of L(X, Y) are identical for all 
 
 
 
 -topologies where 
 
 
 
  is any family of bounded subsets of X covering X.9
If 
 
 
 
  is any collection of bounded subsets of X whose union is total in X then every equicontinuous subset of L(X, Y) is bounded in the 
 
 
 
 -topology.10

Examples
The topology of pointwise convergence Lσ(X, Y)
By letting 
 
 
 
  be the set of all finite subsets of X, L(X, Y) will have the weak topology on L(X, Y) or the topology of pointwise convergence and L(X, Y) with this topology is denoted by 
 
 

The weak-topology on L(X, Y) has the following properties:

The weak-closure of an equicontinuous subset of L(X, Y) is equicontinuous.
If Y is locally convex, then the convex balanced hull of an equicontinuous subset of 
 
 
 
  is equicontinuous.
If A ⊆ X is a contable dense subset of a topological vector space X and if Y is a metrizable topological vector space then 
 
 
 
  is metrizable.
 
So in particular, on every equicontinuous subset of L(X, Y), the topology of pointwise convergence is metrizable.

Let 
 
 
 
  denote the space of all functions from X into Y. If 
 
 
 
  is given the topology of pointwise convergence then space of all linear maps (continuous or not) X into Y is closed in 
 
 
 
 .
 
In addition, L(X, Y) is dense in the space of all linear maps (continuous or not) X into Y.


Compact-convex convergence Lγ(X, Y)
By letting 
 
 
 
  be the set of all compact convex subsets of X, L(X, Y) will have the topology of compact convex convergence or the topology of uniform convergence on compact convex sets L(X, Y) with this topology is denoted by 
 
 
 
 .
Compact convergence Lc(X, Y)
By letting 
 
 
 
  be the set of all compact subsets of X, L(X, Y) will have the topology of compact convergence or the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets and L(X, Y) with this topology is denoted by 
 
 
 
 .
The topology of bounded convergence on L(X, Y) has the following properties:

If X is a Frechet space or a LF-space and if Y is a complete locally convex Hausdorff space then 
 
 
 
  is complete.
On equicontinuous subsets of L(X, Y), the following topologies coincide:
 
The topology of pointwise convergence on a dense subset of X,
The topology of pointwise convergence on X,
The topology of compact convergence.

If X is a Montel space and Y is a topological vector space, then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have identical topologies.

Strong dual topology Lb(X, Y)
By letting 
 
 
 
  be the set of all bounded subsets of X, L(X, Y) will have the topology of bounded convergence on X or the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets and L(X, Y) with this topology is denoted by 
 
 
 
 .
The topology of bounded convergence on L(X, Y) has the following properties:

If X is a bornological space and if Y is a complete locally convex Hausdorff space then 
 
 
 
  is complete.
If X and Y are both normed spaces then 
 
 
 
  is a normed space with the usual operator norm.
Every equicontinuous subset of L(X, Y) is bounded in 
 
 
 
 .

G-topologies on the continuous dual induced by X
The continuous dual space of a topological vector space X over the field 
 
 
 
  (which we will assume to be real or complex numbers) is the vector space 
 
 
 
  and is denoted by 
 
 
 
  and sometimes by 
 
 
 
 . Given 
 
 
 
 , a set of subsets of X, we can apply all of the preceding to this space by using 
 
 
 
  and in this case 
 
 
 
  with this 
 
 
 
 -topology is denoted by 
 
 
 
 , so that in particular we have the following basic properties:

A basis of neighborhoods of 0 for 
 
 
 
  is formed, as 
 
 
 
  varies over 
 
 
 
 , by the polar sets

 
 .
 
A filter

 
  on 
 
 
 
  converges to an element 
 
 
 
  in the 
 
 
 
 -topology on 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  uniformly to 
 
 
 
  on each 
 
 
 
 .
If G ⊆ X is bounded then 
 
 
 
  is absorbing, so 
 
 
 
  usually consists of bounded subsets of X.



 
  is locally convex,
If 
 
 
 
  is dense in X then 
 
 
 
  is Hausdorff.
If 
 
 
 
  covers X then the canonical map from X into 
 
 
 
  is well-defined. That is, for all 
 
 
 
  the evaluation functional on 
 
 
 
  (i.e. 
 
 
 
 ) is continuous on 
 
 
 
 .
 
If in addition 
 
 
 
  separates points on X then the canonical map of X into 
 
 
 
  is an injection.

Suppose that X and Y are two topological vector spaces and 
 
 
 
  is a continuous linear map. Suppose that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are collections of bounded subsets of X and Y, respectively, that both satisfy axioms 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 's transpose, 
 
 
 
  is continuous if for every 
 
 
 
  there is a 
 
 
 
  such that u(G) ⊆ H.11

In particular, the transpose of 
 
 
 
  is continuous if 
 
 
 
  carries the 
 
 
 
  (respectively, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 ) topology and 
 
 
 
  carry any topology stronger than the 
 
 
 
  topology (respectively, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 ).

If X is a locally convex Hausdorff topological vector space over the field 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a collection of bounded subsets of X that satisfies axioms 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then the bilinear map 
 
 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
  is continuous if and only if X is normable and the 
 
 
 
 -topology on 
 
 
 
  is the strong dual topology 
 
 
 
 .
Suppose that X is a Frechet space and 
 
 
 
  is a collection of bounded subsets of X that satisfies axioms 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  contains all compact subsets of X then 
 
 
 
  is complete.

Examples
The weak topology σ(X*, X) or the weak* topology
By letting 
 
 
 
  be the set of all finite subsets of X, 
 
 
 
  will have the weak topology on 
 
 
 more commonly known as the weak* topology or the topology of pointwise convergence, which is denoted by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with this topology is denoted by 
 
 
 
  or by 
 
 
 
  if there may be ambiguity.
The 
 
 
 
  topology has the following properties:

Theorem (S. Banach): Suppose that X and Y are Frechet spaces or that they are duals of reflexive Frechet spaces and that 
 
 
 
  is a continuous linear map. Then 
 
 
 
  is surjective if and only if the transpose of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , is one-to-one and the range of 
 
 
 
  is weakly closed in 
 
 
 
 .
Suppose that X and Y are Frechet spaces, 
 
 
 
  is a Hausdorff locally convex space and that 
 
 
 
  is a separately-continuous bilinear map. Then 
 
 
 
  is continuous.
 
In particular, any separately continuous bilinear maps from the product of two duals of reflexive Frechet spaces into a third one is continuous.



 
  is normable if and only if X is finite-dimensional.
When X is infinite-dimensional the 
 
 
 
  topology on 
 
 
 
  is strictly less fine than the strong dual topology 
 
 
 
 .
The 
 
 
 
 -closure of the convex balanced hull of an equicontinuous subset of 
 
 
 
  is equicontinuous and 
 
 
 
 -compact.
Suppose that X is a locally convex Hausdorff space and that 
 
 
 
  is its completion. If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is strictly finer than

  topology.

  will have the topology of compact convex convergence or the topology of uniform convergence on compact convex sets, which is denoted by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with this topology is denoted by 
 
 
 
  or by 
 
 
 
 .

 .

Compact convergence c(X*, X)
By letting 
 
 
 
  be the set of all compact subsets of X, 
 
 
 
  will have the topology of compact convergence or the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets, which is denoted by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with this topology is denoted by 
 
 
 
  or by 
 
 
 
 .

If X is a Frechet space or a LF-space then 
 
 
 
  is complete.
Suppose that X is a metrizable topological vector space and that 
 
 
 
 . If the intersection of 
 
 
 
  with every equicontinuous subset of 
 
 
 
  is weakly-open, then 
 
 
 
  is open in 
 
 
 
 .

  be the set of all convex balanced weakly compact subsets of X, 
 
 
 
  will have the Mackey topology on 
 
 
 or the topology of uniform convergence on convex balanced weakly compact sets, which is denoted by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with this topology is denoted by 
 
 
 
 .
Strong dual topology b(X*, X)
By letting 
 
 
 
  be the set of all bounded subsets of X, 
 
 
 
  will have the topology of bounded convergence on X or the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets or the strong dual topology on 
 
 
, which is denoted by

The 
 
 
 
  topology has the following properties:

If X is locally convex, then this topology is finer than all other 
 
 
 
 -topologies on 
 
 
 
  when considering only 
 
 
 
 's whose sets are subsets of X.
If X is a bornological space (ex: metrizable or LF-space) then

G-topologies on X induced by the continuous dual
There is a canonical map from X into 
 
 
 
  which maps an element 
 
 
 
  to the following map
 
 
 
 . By using this canonical map we can identify X as being contained in the continuous dual of 
 
 
 
  i.e. contained in 
 
 
 
 . In fact, this canonical map is onto, which means that 
 
 
 
  so that we can through this canonical isomorphism think of X as the continuous dual space of 
 
 
 
 . Note that it is a common convention that if an equal sign appears between two sets which are clearly not equal, then the equality really means that the sets are isomorphic through some canonical map.
Since we are now regarding X as the continuous dual space of 
 
 
 
 , we can look at sets of subsets of 
 
 
 
 , say 
 
 
 
  and construct a dual space topology on the dual of 
 
 
 
 , which is X. * A basis of neighborhoods of 0 for

By letting 
 
 
 
  be the set of all finite subsets of 
 
 
 
 , X will have the 'weak topology or the topology of pointwise convergence on 
 
 
', which is denoted by 
 
 
 
  and X with this topology is denoted by

  if there may be ambiguity.

Suppose that X and Y are Hausdorff locally convex spaces with X metrizable and that 
 
 
 
  is a linear map. Then

  or by 
 
 
 
 .

If 
 
 
 
  was the set of all convex balanced weakly compact equicontinuous subsets of

The Mackey–Arens theorem
Let X be a vector space and let Y be a vector subspace of the algebraic dual of X that separates points on X. Any locally convex Hausdorff topological vector space (TVS) topology on X with the property that when X is equipped with this topology has Y as its continuous dual space is said to be compatible with duality between X and Y. If we give X the weak topology 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is a Hausdorff locally convex topological vector space (TVS) and 
 
 
 
  is compatible with duality between X and Y (i.e. 
 
 
 
 ). We can now ask the question: what are all of the locally convex Hausdorff TVS topologies that we can place on X that are compatible with duality between X and Y? The answer to this question is called the Mackey–Arens theorem:13

Theorem. Let X be a vector space and let 
 
 
 
  be a locally convex Hausdorff topological vector space topology on X. Let

G-H-topologies on spaces of bilinear maps
We will let 
 
 
 
  denote the space of separately continuous bilinear maps and 
 
 
 
  denote its subspace the space of continuous bilinear maps, where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are topological vector space over the same field (either the real or complex numbers). In an analogous way to how we placed a topology on L(X, Y) we can place a topology on 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be a set of subsets of X, 
 
 
 
  be a set of subsets of Y. Let 
 
 
 
  denote the collection of all sets G × H where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . We can place on 
 
 
 
  the 
 
 
 
 -topology, and consequently on any of its subsets, in particular on 
 
 
 
  and on 
 
 
 
 . This topology is known as the 

 
 -topology or as the topology of uniform convergence on the products 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
.
However, as before, this topology is not necessarily compatible with the vector space structure of 
 
 
 
  or of 
 
 
 
  without the additional requirement that for all bilinear maps, 
 
 
 
  in this space (that is, in 
 
 
 
  or in 
 
 
 
 ) and for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the set 
 
 
 
  is bounded in X. If both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  consist of bounded sets then this requirement is automatically satisfied if we are topologizing 
 
 
 
  but this may not be the case if we are trying to topologize 
 
 
 
 . The 
 
 
 
 -
 
 
 
 -topology on 
 
 
 
  will be compatible with the vector space structure of 
 
 
 
  if both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  consists of bounded sets and any of the following conditions hold:

X and Y are barrelled spaces and 
 
 
 
  is locally convex.
X is a F-space, Y is metrizable, and 
 
 
 
  is Hausdorff, in which case

X is normed and Y and 
 
 
 
  the strong duals of reflexive Frechet spaces.

The ε-topology
Suppose that 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are locally convex spaces and let 
 
 
 
 ' and 
 
 
 
 ' be the collections of equicontinuous subsets of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively. Then the 
 
 
 
 '-
 
 
 
 '-topology on 
 
 
 
  will be a topological vector space topology. This topology is called the ε-topology and 
 
 
 
  with this topology it is denoted by 
 
 
 
  or simply by 
 
 
 
 .
Part of the importance of this vector space and this topology is that it contains many subspace, such as 
 
 
 
 , which we denote by

  it is denoted by

In the instance where Z is the field of these vector spaces 
 
 
 
  is a tensor product of X and Y. In fact, if X and Y are locally convex Hausdorff spaces then 
 
 
 
  is vector space isomorphic to

 .
These spaces have the following properties:

If X and Y are locally convex Hausdorff spaces then 
 
 

 
  is complete if and only if both X and Y are complete.
If X and Y are both normed (or both Banach) then so is
