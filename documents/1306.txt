   Singular measure      Singular measure   In mathematics , two positive (or signed or complex ) measures μ and ν defined on a measurable space (Ω, Σ) are called singular if there exist two disjoint sets A and B in Σ whose union is Ω such that μ is zero on all measurable subsets of B while ν is zero on all measurable subsets of A . This is denoted by     μ  ⟂  ν   .     perpendicular-to  μ  ν    \mu\perp\nu.     A refined form of Lebesgue's decomposition theorem decomposes a singular measure into a singular continuous measure and a discrete measure . See below for examples.  Examples on R n  As a particular case, a measure defined on the Euclidean space  R n is called singular , if it is singular in respect to the Lebesgue measure on this space. For example, the Dirac delta function is a singular measure.  Example. A discrete measure .  The Heaviside step function on the real line ,       H   (  x  )     =  def    {      0  ,       x  <  0   ;        1  ,       x  ≥  0   ;           superscript   def     H  x    cases  0    x  0   1    x  0      H(x)\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\begin{cases}0,&x<0;\\
 1,&x\geq 0;\end{cases}     has the Dirac delta distribution     δ  0     subscript  δ  0    \delta_{0}   as its distributional derivative. This is a measure on the real line, a "point mass" at 0. However, the Dirac measure     δ  0     subscript  δ  0    \delta_{0}   is not absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure   λ   λ   \lambda   , nor is   λ   λ   \lambda   absolutely continuous with respect to    δ  0     subscript  δ  0    \delta_{0}        λ   (   {  0  }   )    =  0        λ   0    0    \lambda(\{0\})=0   but      δ  0    (   {  0  }   )    =  1         subscript  δ  0    0    1    \delta_{0}(\{0\})=1   ; if   U   U   U   is any open set not containing 0, then     λ   (  U  )    >  0        λ  U   0    \lambda(U)>0   but      δ  0    (  U  )    =  0         subscript  δ  0   U   0    \delta_{0}(U)=0   .  Example. A singular continuous measure.  The Cantor distribution has a cumulative distribution function that is continuous but not absolutely continuous , and indeed its absolutely continuous part is zero: it is singular continuous.
