   Superstrong cardinal      Superstrong cardinal   In mathematics , a cardinal number κ is called superstrong  if and only if there exists an elementary embedding  j : V → M from V into a transitive inner model M with critical point κ and    V   j   (  κ  )       subscript  V    j  κ     V_{j(\kappa)}   ⊆ M .  Similarly, a cardinal κ is n-superstrong if and only if there exists an elementary embedding  j : V → M from V into a transitive inner model M with critical point κ and    V    j  n    (  κ  )       subscript  V     superscript  j  n   κ     V_{j^{n}(\kappa)}   ⊆ M . Akihiro Kanamori has shown that the consistency strength of an n+1-superstrong cardinal exceeds that of an n-huge cardinal for each n > 0.
