Na+-exporting ATPase




Na+-exporting ATPase

  In enzymology, a Na+-exporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + H2O + Na+

 
  ADP + phosphate + Na+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, H2O, and Na+, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and Na+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (Na+-exporting).
