   Coins in a fountain      Coins in a fountain   In combinatorial mathematics, coins in a fountain is an interesting problem with an even more interesting generating function . The problem is described below: Solution :      First few terms of the sequence 1 2   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   12   13     1   1   1   2   3   5   9   15   26   45   78   135   234   ...     The above sequence show the number of ways in which n coins can be stacked. So, for example for 9 coins we have 45 different ways of stacking them in a fountain. The number    f   (  n  ,  k  )       f   n  k     f(n,k)   which is the solution for the above stated problem is then given by the coefficients of the polynomial of the following generating function:  }} \end{align} | 1 }} Such generating function are extensively studied in 3  Specifically, the number of such fountains that can be created using n coins is given by the coefficients of:  }} \, \end{align} | 2 }} This is easily seen by substituting the value of y to be 1. This is because, suppose the generating function for () is of the form:       ∑  n     ∑  k     C   n  ,  k     x  n    y  k         subscript   n     subscript   k      subscript  C   n  k     superscript  x  n    superscript  y  k       \sum_{n}\sum_{k}C_{n,k}x^{n}y^{k}     then, if we want to get the total number of fountains we need to do summation over k . So, the number of fountains with n total coins can be given by:       ∑  k     C   n  ,  k     x  n    y  k        subscript   k      subscript  C   n  k     superscript  x  n    superscript  y  k      \sum_{k}C_{n,k}x^{n}y^{k}     which can be obtained by substituting the value of y to be 1 and observing the coefficient of x n .  Proof of generating function (). Consider the number of ways of forming a fountain of n coins with k coins at base to be given by    f   (  n  ,  k  )       f   n  k     f(n,k)   . Now, consider the number of ways of forming the same but with the restriction that the second most bottom layer (above the base layer) contains no gaps, i.e. it contains exactly k − 1 coins. Let this be called primitive fountain and denote it by    g   (  n  ,  k  )       g   n  k     g(n,k)   . The two functions are related by the following equation:  This is because, we can view the primitive fountain as a normal fountain of n − k ' coins with k − 1 coins in the base layer staked on top of a single layer of k coins without any gaps. Also, consider a normal fountain with a supposed gap in the second last layer (w.r.t. the base layer) in the r position. So, the normal fountain can be viewed as a set of two fountains:   A primitive fountain with n ' coins in it and base layer having r coins.  A normal fountain with n − n ' coins in it and the base layer having k − r coins.   So, we get the following relation:  Now, we can easily observe the generating function relation for () to be:  and for () to be:  Now, simply substituting () in () we get the relation:      F   (  x  ,  y  )       F   x  y     \displaystyle F(x,y)     References  "  Category:Combinatorics     Sloane, N.
