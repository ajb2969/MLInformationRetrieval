   Summation by parts      Summation by parts   In mathematics , summation by parts transforms the summation of products of sequences into other summations, often simplifying the computation or (especially) estimation of certain types of sums. The summation by parts formula is sometimes called Abel's lemma or Abel transformation .  Statement  Suppose    {   f  k   }      subscript  f  k     \{f_{k}\}   and    {   g  k   }      subscript  g  k     \{g_{k}\}   are two sequences . Then,         ∑   k  =  m   n     f  k    (    g   k  +  1    -   g  k    )     =    [     f   n  +  1     g   n  +  1     -    f  m    g  m     ]   -    ∑   k  =  m   n     g   k  +  1     (    f   k  +  1    -   f  k    )       .        superscript   subscript     k  m    n      subscript  f  k      subscript  g    k  1     subscript  g  k         delimited-[]       subscript  f    n  1     subscript  g    n  1        subscript  f  m    subscript  g  m        superscript   subscript     k  m    n      subscript  g    k  1       subscript  f    k  1     subscript  f  k         \sum_{k=m}^{n}f_{k}(g_{k+1}-g_{k})=\left[f_{n+1}g_{n+1}-f_{m}g_{m}\right]-\sum%
 _{k=m}^{n}g_{k+1}(f_{k+1}-f_{k}).     Using the forward difference operator    Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   , it can be stated more succinctly as         ∑   k  =  m   n     f  k   Δ   g  k     =    [     f   n  +  1     g   n  +  1     -    f  m    g  m     ]   -    ∑   k  =  m   n     g   k  +  1    Δ   f  k       ,        superscript   subscript     k  m    n      subscript  f  k   normal-Δ   subscript  g  k        delimited-[]       subscript  f    n  1     subscript  g    n  1        subscript  f  m    subscript  g  m        superscript   subscript     k  m    n      subscript  g    k  1    normal-Δ   subscript  f  k        \sum_{k=m}^{n}f_{k}\Delta g_{k}=\left[f_{n+1}g_{n+1}-f_{m}g_{m}\right]-\sum_{k%
 =m}^{n}g_{k+1}\Delta f_{k},     Note that summation by parts is an analogue to the integration by parts formula,        ∫    f   d  g    =    f  g   -   ∫    g   d  f      .          f  d  g        f  g       g  d  f       \int f\,dg=fg-\int g\,df.     Note also that although applications almost always deal with convergence of sequences, the statement is purely algebraic and will work in any field . It will also work when one sequence is in a vector space , and the other is in the relevant field of scalars.  Newton series  The formula is sometimes given in one of these - slightly different - forms        ∑   k  =  0   n      f  k    g  k        superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  f  k    subscript  g  k      \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{n}f_{k}g_{k}     which represent a special case (    M  =  1      M  1    M=1   ) of the more general rule        ∑   k  =  0   n      f  k    g  k        superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  f  k    subscript  g  k      \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{n}f_{k}g_{k}     both result from iterated application of the initial formula. The auxiliary quantities are Newton series :       f  j   (  M  )    :=    ∑   k  =  0   M      (   -  1   )    M  -  k     (     M      k     )    f   j  +  k         assign   superscript   subscript  f  j   M     superscript   subscript     k  0    M      superscript    1     M  k     binomial  M  k    subscript  f    j  k        f_{j}^{(M)}:=\sum_{k=0}^{M}\left(-1\right)^{M-k}{M\choose k}f_{j+k}   and        G  j   (  M  )    :=    ∑   k  =  j   n     (        k  -  j   +  M   -  1        M  -  1      )    g  k      ,     assign   superscript   subscript  G  j   M     superscript   subscript     k  j    n      binomial        k  j   M   1     M  1     subscript  g  k       G_{j}^{(M)}:=\sum_{k=j}^{n}{k-j+M-1\choose M-1}g_{k},            G  ~   j   (  M  )    :=    ∑   k  =  0   j     (        j  -  k   +  M   -  1        M  -  1      )    g  k      .     assign   superscript   subscript   normal-~  G   j   M     superscript   subscript     k  0    j      binomial        j  k   M   1     M  1     subscript  g  k       \tilde{G}_{j}^{(M)}:=\sum_{k=0}^{j}{j-k+M-1\choose M-1}g_{k}.     A remarkable, particular (    M  =   n  +  1       M    n  1     M=n+1   ) result is the noteworthy identity         ∑   k  =  0   n     f  k    g  k     =    ∑   i  =  0   n     f  0   (  i  )     G  i   (   i  +  1   )      =    ∑   i  =  0   n      (   -  1   )   i    f   n  -  i    (  i  )      G  ~    n  -  i    (   i  +  1   )       .          superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  f  k    subscript  g  k       superscript   subscript     i  0    n      superscript   subscript  f  0   i    superscript   subscript  G  i     i  1             superscript   subscript     i  0    n      superscript    1   i    superscript   subscript  f    n  i    i    superscript   subscript   normal-~  G     n  i      i  1         \sum_{k=0}^{n}f_{k}g_{k}=\sum_{i=0}^{n}f_{0}^{(i)}G_{i}^{(i+1)}=\sum_{i=0}^{n}%
 (-1)^{i}f_{n-i}^{(i)}\tilde{G}_{n-i}^{(i+1)}.     Here,    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {n\choose k}   is the binomial coefficient .  Method  For two given sequences    (   a  n   )     subscript  a  n    (a_{n})\,   and    (   b  n   )     subscript  b  n    (b_{n})\,   , with    n  ∈  𝒩      n  𝒩    n\in\mathcal{N}   , one wants to study the sum of the following series:      S  N   =    ∑   n  =  0   N     a  n    b  n          subscript  S  N     superscript   subscript     n  0    N      subscript  a  n    subscript  b  n       S_{N}=\sum_{n=0}^{N}a_{n}b_{n}     If we define      B  n   =    ∑   k  =  0   n    b  k     ,       subscript  B  n     superscript   subscript     k  0    n    subscript  b  k      B_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}b_{k},   then for every     n  >  0   ,      n  0    n>0,\,        b  n   =    B  n   -    B   n  -  1           subscript  b  n      subscript  B  n    subscript  B    n  1       b_{n}=B_{n}-B_{n-1}\,   and        S  N   =     a  0    b  0    +    ∑   n  =  1   N     a  n    (    B  n   -   B   n  -  1     )       ,       subscript  S  N        subscript  a  0    subscript  b  0      superscript   subscript     n  1    N      subscript  a  n      subscript  B  n    subscript  B    n  1          S_{N}=a_{0}b_{0}+\sum_{n=1}^{N}a_{n}(B_{n}-B_{n-1}),           S  N   =      a  0    b  0    -    a  0    B  0     +    a  N    B  N    +    ∑   n  =  0    N  -  1      B  n    (    a  n   -   a   n  +  1     )       .       subscript  S  N          subscript  a  0    subscript  b  0       subscript  a  0    subscript  B  0        subscript  a  N    subscript  B  N      superscript   subscript     n  0      N  1       subscript  B  n      subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  1          S_{N}=a_{0}b_{0}-a_{0}B_{0}+a_{N}B_{N}+\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}B_{n}(a_{n}-a_{n+1}).     Finally      S  N   =     a  N    B  N    -    ∑   n  =  0    N  -  1      B  n    (    a   n  +  1    -   a  n    )       .       subscript  S  N        subscript  a  N    subscript  B  N      superscript   subscript     n  0      N  1       subscript  B  n      subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n         S_{N}=a_{N}B_{N}-\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}B_{n}(a_{n+1}-a_{n}).     This process, called an Abel transformation, can be used to prove several criteria of convergence for     S  N      subscript  S  N    S_{N}\,   .  Similarity with an integration by parts  The formula for an integration by parts is      ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )    g  ′    (  x  )   d  x    =     [   f   (  x  )   g   (  x  )    ]   a  b   -    ∫  a  b     f  ′    (  x  )   g   (  x  )   d  x           superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x   superscript  g  normal-′   x  d  x       superscript   subscript   delimited-[]    f  x  g  x    a   b     superscript   subscript   a   b      superscript  f  normal-′   x  g  x  d  x       \int_{a}^{b}f(x)g^{\prime}(x)\,dx=\left[f(x)g(x)\right]_{a}^{b}-\int_{a}^{b}f^%
 {\prime}(x)g(x)\,dx    Beside the boundary conditions , we notice that the first integral contains two multiplied functions, one which is integrated in the final integral (     g  ′      superscript  g  normal-′    g^{\prime}\,   becomes    g    g   g\,   ) and one which is differentiated (    f    f   f\,   becomes     f  ′      superscript  f  normal-′    f^{\prime}\,   ).  The process of the Abel transformation is similar, since one of the two initial sequences is summed (     b  n      subscript  b  n    b_{n}\,   becomes     B  n      subscript  B  n    B_{n}\,   ) and the other one is differenced (     a  n      subscript  a  n    a_{n}\,   becomes     a   n  +  1    -    a  n         subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n     a_{n+1}-a_{n}\,   ).  Applications   It is used to prove Kronecker's lemma , which in turn, is used to prove a version of the strong law of large numbers under variance constraints.    Summation by parts is frequently used to prove Abel's theorem .    If    ∑   b  n        subscript  b  n     \sum b_{n}   is a convergent series , and    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   a bounded monotone sequence , then     S  N   =    ∑   n  =  0   N     a  n    b  n          subscript  S  N     superscript   subscript     n  0    N      subscript  a  n    subscript  b  n       S_{N}=\sum_{n=0}^{N}a_{n}b_{n}   remains a convergent series.   The Cauchy criterion gives       S  M   -   S  N        subscript  S  M    subscript  S  N     \displaystyle S_{M}-S_{N}   where a is the limit of    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   . As    ∑   b  n        subscript  b  n     \sum b_{n}   is convergent,    B  N     subscript  B  N    B_{N}   is bounded independently of   N   N   N   , say by   B   B   B   . As     a  n   -  a       subscript  a  n   a    a_{n}-a   go to zero, so go the first two terms. The third term goes to zero by the Cauchy criterion for    ∑   b  n        subscript  b  n     \sum b_{n}   . The remaining sum is bounded by        ∑   n  =  N    M  -  1      |   B  n   |    |    a   n  +  1    -   a  n    |     ≤   B    ∑   n  =  N    M  -  1     |    a   n  +  1    -   a  n    |     =   B   |    a  N   -   a  M    |            superscript   subscript     n  N      M  1         subscript  B  n         subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n         B    superscript   subscript     n  N      M  1         subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n              B       subscript  a  N    subscript  a  M         \sum_{n=N}^{M-1}|B_{n}||a_{n+1}-a_{n}|\leq B\sum_{n=N}^{M-1}|a_{n+1}-a_{n}|=B|%
 a_{N}-a_{M}|     by the monotonicity of    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   , and also goes to zero as    N  →  ∞     normal-→  N     N\to\infty   .   Using the same proof as above, one shows that    if the partial sums    B  N     subscript  B  N    B_{N}   form a bounded sequence independently of   N   N   N   ;  if      ∑   n  =  0   ∞    |    a   n  +  1    -   a  n    |    <  ∞        superscript   subscript     n  0           subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n         \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}|a_{n+1}-a_{n}|<\infty   (so that the sum     ∑   n  =  N    M  -  1     |    a   n  +  1    -   a  n    |       superscript   subscript     n  N      M  1         subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n       \sum_{n=N}^{M-1}|a_{n+1}-a_{n}|   goes to zero as   N   N   N   goes to infinity) ; and  if     lim   a  n    =  0         subscript  a  n    0    \lim a_{n}=0      then     S  N   =    ∑   n  =  0   N     a  n    b  n          subscript  S  N     superscript   subscript     n  0    N      subscript  a  n    subscript  b  n       S_{N}=\sum_{n=0}^{N}a_{n}b_{n}   is a convergent series.  In both cases, the sum of the series satisfies:     |  S  |   =   |    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     a  n    b  n     |   ≤   B    ∑   n  =  0   ∞    |    a   n  +  1    -   a  n    |             S       superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  a  n    subscript  b  n             B    superscript   subscript     n  0           subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n          |S|=\left|\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}b_{n}\right|\leq B\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}|a_{n+1%
