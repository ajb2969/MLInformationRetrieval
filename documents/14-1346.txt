Norm group

In number theory, a norm group is a group of the form 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a finite abelian extension of nonarchimedean local fields. One of the main theorems in local class field theory states that the norm groups in 
 
 
 
  are precisely the open subgroups of 
 
 
 
  of Ô¨Ånite index.
