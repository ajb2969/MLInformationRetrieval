   Norm group      Norm group   In number theory , a norm group is a group of the form     N   L  /  K     (   L  ×   )        subscript  N    L  K     superscript  L      N_{L/K}(L^{\times})   where    L  /  K      L  K    L/K   is a finite abelian extension of nonarchimedean local fields . One of the main theorems in local class field theory states that the norm groups in    K  ×     superscript  K     K^{\times}   are precisely the open subgroups of    K  ×     superscript  K     K^{\times}   of ﬁnite index.
