D-iditol 2-dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a D-iditol 2-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-iditol + NAD+

 
  D-sorbose + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-iditol and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are D-sorbose, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-iditol:NAD+ 2-oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called D-sorbitol dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions and fructose and mannose metabolism.
