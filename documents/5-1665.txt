   Factor theorem      Factor theorem   In algebra , the factor theorem is a theorem linking factors and zeros of a polynomial . It is a special case of the polynomial remainder theorem . 1  The factor theorem states that a polynomial    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   has a factor    (   x  -  k   )      x  k    (x-k)    if and only if      f   (  k  )    =  0        f  k   0    f(k)=0   (i.e.   k   k   k   is a root). 2  Factorization of polynomials  Two problems where the factor theorem is commonly applied are those of factoring a polynomial and finding the roots of a polynomial equation; it is a direct consequence of the theorem that these problems are essentially equivalent.  The factor theorem is also used to remove known zeros from a polynomial while leaving all unknown zeros intact, thus producing a lower degree polynomial whose zeros may be easier to find. Abstractly, the method is as follows: 3   "Guess" a zero   a   a   a   of the polynomial   f   f   f   . (In general, this can be very hard , but maths textbook problems that involve solving a polynomial equation are often designed so that some roots are easy to discover.)  Use the factor theorem to conclude that    (   x  -  a   )      x  a    (x-a)   is a factor of    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   .  Compute the polynomial     g   (  x  )    =    f   (  x  )    /   (   x  -  a   )          g  x       f  x     x  a      g(x)=f(x)\big/(x-a)   , for example using polynomial long division or synthetic division .  Conclude that any root    x  ≠  a      x  a    x\neq a   of     f   (  x  )    =  0        f  x   0    f(x)=0   is a root of     g   (  x  )    =  0        g  x   0    g(x)=0   . Since the polynomial degree of   g   g   g   is one less than that of   f   f   f   , it is "simpler" to find the remaining zeros by studying   g   g   g   .   Example  Find the factors at       x  3   +   7   x  2    +   8  x   +  2.       superscript  x  3     7   superscript  x  2      8  x   2.    x^{3}+7x^{2}+8x+2.     To do this you would use trial and error to find the first x value that causes the expression to equal zero. To find out if    (   x  -  1   )      x  1    (x-1)   is a factor, substitute    x  =  1      x  1    x=1   into the polynomial above:        x  3   +   7   x  2    +   8  x   +  2   =     (  1  )   3   +   7    (  1  )   2    +   8   (  1  )    +  2          superscript  x  3     7   superscript  x  2      8  x   2      superscript  1  3     7   superscript  1  2      8  1   2     x^{3}+7x^{2}+8x+2=(1)^{3}+7(1)^{2}+8(1)+2          =   1  +  7  +  8  +  2       absent    1  7  8  2     =1+7+8+2          =  18.      absent  18.    =18.     As this is equal to 18 and not 0 this means    (   x  -  1   )      x  1    (x-1)   is not a factor of     x  3   +   7   x  2    +   8  x   +  2       superscript  x  3     7   superscript  x  2      8  x   2    x^{3}+7x^{2}+8x+2   . So, we next try    (   x  +  1   )      x  1    (x+1)   (substituting    x  =   -  1       x    1     x=-1   into the polynomial):        (   -  1   )   3   +   7    (   -  1   )   2    +   8   (   -  1   )    +  2.       superscript    1   3     7   superscript    1   2      8    1    2.    (-1)^{3}+7(-1)^{2}+8(-1)+2.     This is equal to   0   0    . Therefore    x  -   (   -  1   )       x    1     x-(-1)   , which is to say    x  +  1      x  1    x+1   , is a factor, and    -  1      1    -1   is a root of     x  3   +   7   x  2    +   8  x   +  2.       superscript  x  3     7   superscript  x  2      8  x   2.    x^{3}+7x^{2}+8x+2.     The next two roots can be found by algebraically dividing     x  3   +   7   x  2    +   8  x   +  2       superscript  x  3     7   superscript  x  2      8  x   2    x^{3}+7x^{2}+8x+2   by    (   x  +  1   )      x  1    (x+1)   to get a quadratic, which can be solved directly, by the factor theorem or by the quadratic formula .         x  3   +   7   x  2    +   8  x   +  2    x  +  1    =    x  2   +   6  x   +  2            superscript  x  3     7   superscript  x  2      8  x   2     x  1       superscript  x  2     6  x   2     {x^{3}+7x^{2}+8x+2\over x+1}=x^{2}+6x+2     and therefore    (   x  +  1   )      x  1    (x+1)   and     x  2   +   6  x   +  2       superscript  x  2     6  x   2    x^{2}+6x+2   are the factors of     x  3   +   7   x  2    +   8  x   +  2.       superscript  x  3     7   superscript  x  2      8  x   2.    x^{3}+7x^{2}+8x+2.
