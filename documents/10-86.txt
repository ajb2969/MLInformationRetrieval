   Porous set      Porous set   In mathematics , a porous set is a concept in the study of metric spaces . Like the concepts of meagre and measure zero sets, a porous set can be considered "sparse" or "lacking bulk"; however, porous sets are not equivalent to either meagre sets or measure zero sets, as shown below.  Definition  Let ( X , d ) be a complete metric space and let E be a subset of X . Let B ( x , r ) denote the closed ball in ( X , d ) with centre x ∈ X and radius r > 0. E is said to be porous if there exist constants 0 0 > 0 such that, for every 0 0 and every x ∈ X , there is some point y ∈ X with        B   (  y  ,   α  r   )    ⊆    B   (  x  ,  r  )    ∖  E    .        B   y    α  r         B   x  r    E     B(y,\alpha r)\subseteq B(x,r)\setminus E.     A subset of X is called σ -porous if it is a countable  union of porous subsets of X .  Properties   Any porous set is nowhere dense . Hence, all σ -porous sets are meagre sets (or of the first category ).  If X is a finite-dimensional Euclidean space  R n , then porous subsets are sets of Lebesgue measure  zero .  However, there does exist a non- σ -porous subset P of R n which is of the first category and of Lebesgue measure zero. This is known as Zajíček's theorem .  The relationship between porosity and being nowhere dense can be illustrated as follows: if E is nowhere dense, then for x ∈ X and r > 0, there is a point y ∈ X and s > 0 such that           B   (  y  ,  s  )    ⊆    B   (  x  ,  r  )    ∖  E    .        B   y  s        B   x  r    E     B(y,s)\subseteq B(x,r)\setminus E.         However, if E is also porous, then it is possible to take s = αr (at least for small enough r ), where 0 < α < 1 is a constant that depends only on E .
