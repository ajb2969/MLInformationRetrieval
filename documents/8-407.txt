   Real analytic Eisenstein series      Real analytic Eisenstein series   In mathematics , the simplest real analytic Eisenstein series is a special function of two variables. It is used in the representation theory of SL(2, R ) and in analytic number theory . It is closely related to the Epstein zeta function.  There are many generalizations associated to more complicated groups.  Definition  The Eisenstein series E ( z , s ) for z = x + iy in the upper half-plane is defined by       E   (  z  ,  s  )    =    1  2     ∑    (  m  ,  n  )   =  1      y  s     |    m  z   +  n   |    2  s             E   z  s        1  2     subscript      m  n   1       superscript  y  s    superscript        m  z   n      2  s         E(z,s)={1\over 2}\sum_{(m,n)=1}{y^{s}\over|mz+n|^{2s}}     for Re( s ) > 1, and by analytic continuation for other values of the complex number s . The sum is over all pairs of coprime integers.  Warning : there are several other slightly different definitions. Some authors omit the factor of ½, and some sum over all pairs of integers that are not both zero; which changes the function by a factor of ζ(2 s ).  Properties  As a function on z  Viewed as a function of z , E ( z , s ) is a real-analytic eigenfunction of the Laplace operator on H with the eigenvalue s ( s -1). In other words, it satisfies the elliptic partial differential equation         y  2    (     ∂  2    ∂   x  2     +    ∂  2    ∂   y  2      )   E   (  z  ,  s  )    =   s   (   s  -  1   )   E   (  z  ,  s  )     ,         superscript  y  2        superscript   2      superscript  x  2        superscript   2      superscript  y  2      E   z  s      s    s  1   E   z  s      y^{2}\left(\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y^%
 {2}}\right)E(z,s)=s(s-1)E(z,s),   where     z  =   x  +   y  i     .      z    x    y  i      z=x+yi.     The function E ( z , s ) is invariant under the action of SL(2, Z ) on z in the upper half plane by fractional linear transformations . Together with the previous property, this means that the Eisenstein series is a Maass form , a real-analytic analogue of a classical elliptic modular function .  Warning : E ( z , s ) is not a square-integrable function of z with respect to the invariant Riemannian metric on H .  As a function on s  The Eisenstein series converges for Re( s )>1, but can be analytically continued to a meromorphic function of s on the entire complex plane, with a unique pole of residue π at s = 1 (for all z in H ). The constant term of the pole at s = 1 is described by the Kronecker limit formula .  The modified function        E  *    (  z  ,  s  )    =    π   -  s    Γ   (  s  )   ζ   (   2  s   )   E   (  z  ,  s  )           superscript  E     z  s       superscript  π    s    normal-Γ  s  ζ    2  s   E   z  s      E^{*}(z,s)=\pi^{-s}\Gamma(s)\zeta(2s)E(z,s)     satisfies the functional equation        E  *    (  z  ,  s  )    =    E  *    (  z  ,   1  -  s   )           superscript  E     z  s       superscript  E     z    1  s       E^{*}(z,s)=E^{*}(z,1-s)     analogous to the functional equation for the Riemann zeta function ζ( s ).  Scalar product of two different Eisenstein series E ( z , s ) and E ( z , t ) is given by the Maass-Selberg relations .  Fourier expansion  The above properties of the real analytic Eisenstein series, i.e. the functional equation for E(z,s) and E * (z,s) using Laplacian on H , are shown from the fact that E(z,s) has a Fourier expansion:      E   (  z  ,  s  )    =    y  s   +      ζ  ^    (    2  s   -  1   )     ζ   (   2  s   )      y   1  -  s     +    4    ζ  ^    (   2  s   )       ∑   m  =  1   ∞     m   s  -   1  /  2      σ   1  -   2  s      (  m  )    y    K   s  -   1  /  2      (   2  π  m  y   )    cos   (   2  π  m  x   )         ,        E   z  s       superscript  y  s          normal-^  ζ       2  s   1      ζ    2  s      superscript  y    1  s         4     normal-^  ζ     2  s       superscript   subscript     m  1         superscript  m    s    1  2      subscript  σ    1    2  s     m    y    subscript  K    s    1  2       2  π  m  y       2  π  m  x          E(z,s)=y^{s}+\frac{\hat{\zeta}(2s-1)}{\zeta(2s)}y^{1-s}+\frac{4}{\hat{\zeta}(2%

 2\pi mx)\ ,     where         ζ  ^    (  s  )    =    π   -   s  /  2     Γ   (   s  2   )   ζ   (  s  )     ,         normal-^  ζ   s      superscript  π      s  2     normal-Γ    s  2   ζ  s     \hat{\zeta}(s)=\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma\biggl(\frac{s}{2}\biggr)\zeta(s)\ ,            σ  s    (  m  )    =    ∑   d  |  m      d  s      ,         subscript  σ  s   m     subscript    fragments  d  normal-|  m     superscript  d  s      \sigma_{s}(m)=\sum_{d|m}d^{s}\ ,   and modified Bessel functions       K  s    (  z  )        subscript  K  s   z    \displaystyle K_{s}(z)     Epstein zeta function  The Epstein zeta function ζ Q ( s )  for a positive definite integral quadratic form Q ( m , n ) = cm 2 + bmn + an 2 is defined by         ζ  Q    (  s  )    =    ∑    (  m  ,  n  )   ≠   (  0  ,  0  )      1   Q    (  m  ,  n  )   s       .         subscript  ζ  Q   s     subscript      m  n    0  0       1    Q   superscript   m  n   s        \zeta_{Q}(s)=\sum_{(m,n)\neq(0,0)}{1\over Q(m,n)^{s}}.     It is essentially a special case of the real analytic Eisenstein series for a special value of z , since       Q   (  m  ,  n  )    =   a    |    m  z   +  n   |   2          Q   m  n      a   superscript        m  z   n    2      Q(m,n)=a|mz+n|^{2}     for       z  =     -  b    2  a    +    i     -   b  2    +   4  a  c       2  a      .      z        b     2  a        i         superscript  b  2      4  a  c        2  a       z=\frac{-b}{2a}+\frac{i\sqrt{-b^{2}+4ac}}{2a}.     This zeta function was named after Paul Epstein .  Generalizations  The real analytic Eisenstein series E ( z , s ) is really the Eisenstein series associated to the discrete subgroup SL(2, Z ) of SL(2, R ) . Selberg described generalizations to other discrete subgroups Γ of SL(2, R ), and used these to study the representation of SL(2, R ) on L 2 (SL(2, R )/Γ). Langlands extended Selberg's work to higher dimensional groups; his notoriously difficult proofs were later simplified by Joseph Bernstein .
