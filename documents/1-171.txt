   Circumference      Circumference   Circumference (from Latin circumferentia , meaning "carrying around") is the linear distance around the edge of a closed curve or circular object. 1 The circumference of a circle is of special importance in geometry and trigonometry . Informally "circumference" may also refer to the edge itself rather than to the length of the edge. Circumference is a special case of perimeter : the perimeter is the length around any closed figure, but conventionally "perimeter" is typically used in reference to a polygon while "circumference" typically refers to a continuously differentiable curve.  Circumference of a circle  The circumference of a circle is the distance around it. The term is used when measuring physical objects, as well as when considering abstract geometric forms.  Relationship with Pi  The circumference of a circle relates to one of the most important mathematical constants in all of mathematics . This constant , pi , is represented by the Greek letter     π   π   \pi    . The numerical value of   π   π   \pi   is 3.14159 26535 89793 ... (see ). Pi is defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference   C   C   C   to its diameter    d   d   d   :      π  =   C  d       π    C  d     \pi=\frac{C}{d}     Or, equivalently, as the ratio of the circumference to twice the radius . The above formula can be rearranged to solve for the circumference:       C  =   π  ⋅  d   =    2  π   ⋅  r    .        C   normal-⋅  π  d         normal-⋅    2  π   r      {C}=\pi\cdot{d}=2\pi\cdot{r}.\!     The use of the mathematical constant   π   π   \pi   is ubiquitous in mathematics, engineering, and science. While the constant ratio of circumference to radius     C  /  r   =   2  π         C  r     2  π     {C}/{r}=2\pi   also has many uses in mathematics, engineering, and science, it is not formally named. These uses include but are not limited to radians , computer programming , and physical constants .  Circumference of an ellipse  The circumference of an ellipse can be expressed in terms of the complete elliptic integral of the second kind .  Circumference of a graph  In graph theory the circumference of a graph refers to the longest cycle contained in that graph.
