Constructible topology

In commutative algebra, the constructible topology on the spectrum

 
  of a commutative ring

 
  is a topology where each closed set is the image of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  for some algebra B over A. An important feature of this construction is that the map 
 
 
 
  is a closed map with respect to the constructible topology.
With respect to this topology, 
 
 
 
  is a compact,1 Hausdorff, and totally disconnected topological space. In general the constructible topology is a finer topology than the Zariski topology, but the two topologies will coincide if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a von Neumann regular ring, where 
 
 
 
  is the nilradical of A.
