   Constructible topology      Constructible topology   In commutative algebra , the constructible topology on the spectrum     Spec   (  A  )      Spec  A    \operatorname{Spec}(A)   of a commutative ring    A   A   A   is a topology where each closed set is the image of    Spec   (  B  )      Spec  B    \operatorname{Spec}(B)   in    Spec   (  A  )      Spec  A    \operatorname{Spec}(A)   for some algebra  B over A . An important feature of this construction is that the map     Spec   (  B  )    →   Spec   (  A  )       normal-→   Spec  B    Spec  A     \operatorname{Spec}(B)\to\operatorname{Spec}(A)   is a closed map with respect to the constructible topology.  With respect to this topology,    Spec   (  A  )      Spec  A    \operatorname{Spec}(A)   is a compact , 1  Hausdorff , and totally disconnected  topological space . In general the constructible topology is a finer topology than the Zariski topology , but the two topologies will coincide if and only if    A  /   nil   (  A  )        A   nil  A     A/\operatorname{nil}(A)   is a von Neumann regular ring , where    nil   (  A  )      nil  A    \operatorname{nil}(A)\,   is the nilradical of A .
