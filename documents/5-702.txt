   Range problem      Range problem   In computability theory , a range problem is a weakened form of a search problem . It consists of two functions ''f l'' and ''f u'' (the lower and upper bounds) and a linear ordering 1 and f 2 . A Turing machine solves a range problem if, for any x , the machine eventually halts with an output y such that f 1 ( x ) 2( x ).  For example, given any function f with range in R and any g : N → R , the strong range problem StrongRange g ( f ) is given by lower bound       f   (  x  )    ⋅   (   1  -   1   1  -   g   (   |  x  |   )       )      normal-⋅    f  x     1    1    1    g    x         f(x)\cdot\left(1-\frac{1}{1-g(|x|)}\right)     and upper bound       f   (  x  )    ⋅   (   1  -   1   1  +   g   (   |  x  |   )       )      normal-⋅    f  x     1    1    1    g    x         f(x)\cdot\left(1-\frac{1}{1+g(|x|)}\right)   .  Note that g is passed the length of x , not the value, which need not even be a number.  "  Category:Theory of computation
