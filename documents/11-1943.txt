Magnetic Prandtl number

The Magnetic Prandtl number (Prm) is a dimensionless quantity occurring in magnetohydrodynamics which approximates the ratio of momentum diffusivity (viscosity) and magnetic diffusivity. It is defined as:



where:

Rem is the magnetic Reynolds number
Re is the Reynolds number
ν is the momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity)
η is the magnetic diffusivity

At the base of the Sun's convection zone the Magnetic Prandtl number is approximately 10−2, and in the interiors of planets and in liquid-metal laboratory dynamos is approximately 10−5.
As another example, a magnetic Prandtl number of order unity is a widely accepted value for the thin accretion discs. Nevertheless this complicates the problem of launching jets: strong concentrations of magnetic field are required at the inner regions of the disc in order to launch jets, but a magnetic Prandtl number of order unity causes the field to diffuse away faster than it accretes inward.1
