   Cartan decomposition      Cartan decomposition   The Cartan decomposition is a decomposition of a semisimple  Lie group or Lie algebra , which plays an important role in their structure theory and representation theory . It generalizes the polar decomposition or singular value decomposition of matrices. Its history can be traced to the 1880s work of Élie Cartan and Wilhelm Killing .

An involution on   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is a Lie algebra automorphism    θ   θ   \theta   of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   whose square is equal to the identity. Such an involution is called a Cartan involution on   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   if      B  θ    (  X  ,  Y  )    :=   -   B   (  X  ,   θ  Y   )        assign     subscript  B  θ    X  Y        B   X    θ  Y        B_{\theta}(X,Y):=-B(X,\theta Y)   is a positive definite bilinear form .  Two involutions    θ  1     subscript  θ  1    \theta_{1}   and    θ  2     subscript  θ  2    \theta_{2}   are considered equivalent if they differ only by an inner automorphism .  Any real semisimple Lie algebra has a Cartan involution, and any two Cartan involutions are equivalent.

The identity map on   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is an involution, of course. It is the unique Cartan involution of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   if and only if the Killing form of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is negative definite. Equivalently,   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is the Lie algebra of a compact semisimple Lie group.  Let   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   be the complexification of a real semisimple Lie algebra    𝔤  0     subscript  𝔤  0    \mathfrak{g}_{0}   , then complex conjugation on   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is an involution on   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . This is the Cartan involution on   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   if and only if    𝔤  0     subscript  𝔤  0    \mathfrak{g}_{0}   is the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group.  The following maps are involutions of the Lie algebra    𝔰  𝔲   (  n  )       𝔰  𝔲  n    \mathfrak{su}(n)   of the special unitary group SU(n) :  the identity involution      θ  0    (  X  )    =  X         subscript  θ  0   X   X    \theta_{0}(X)=X   , which is the unique Cartan involution in this case;        θ  1    (  X  )    =   -   X  T           subscript  θ  1   X      superscript  X  T      \theta_{1}(X)=-X^{T}   which on    𝔰  𝔲   (  n  )       𝔰  𝔲  n    \mathfrak{su}(n)   is also the complex conjugation;  if    n  =   p  +  q       n    p  q     n=p+q   is odd,      θ  2    (  X  )    =    (      I  p     0      0     -   I  q       )   X   (      I  p     0      0     -   I  q       )           subscript  θ  2   X        subscript  I  p   0    0     subscript  I  q      X     subscript  I  p   0    0     subscript  I  q         \theta_{2}(X)=\begin{pmatrix}I_{p}&0\\
 0&-I_{q}\end{pmatrix}X\begin{pmatrix}I_{p}&0\\
 0&-I_{q}\end{pmatrix}   . These are all equivalent, but not equivalent to the identity involution (because the matrix    (      I  p     0      0     -   I  q       )       subscript  I  p   0    0     subscript  I  q       \begin{pmatrix}I_{p}&0\\
 0&-I_{q}\end{pmatrix}   does not belong to    𝔰  𝔲   (  n  )       𝔰  𝔲  n    \mathfrak{su}(n)   .)  if    n  =   2  m       n    2  m     n=2m   is even, we also have       θ  3    (  X  )    =    (     0     I  m        -   I  m      0     )    X  T    (     0     I  m        -   I  m      0     )     .         subscript  θ  3   X       0   subscript  I  m        subscript  I  m    0     superscript  X  T     0   subscript  I  m        subscript  I  m    0       \theta_{3}(X)=\begin{pmatrix}0&I_{m}\\
 -I_{m}&0\end{pmatrix}X^{T}\begin{pmatrix}0&I_{m}\\
 -I_{m}&0\end{pmatrix}.       Cartan pairs  Let   θ   θ   \theta   be an involution on a Lie algebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . Since     θ  2   =  1       superscript  θ  2   1    \theta^{2}=1   , the linear map   θ   θ   \theta   has the two eigenvalues    ±  1     plus-or-minus  1    \pm 1   . Let   𝔨   𝔨   \mathfrak{k}   and   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   be the corresponding eigenspaces, then    𝔤  =   𝔨  +  𝔭       𝔤    𝔨  𝔭     \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{k}+\mathfrak{p}   . Since   θ   θ   \theta   is a Lie algebra automorphism, eigenvalues are multiplicative. It follows that       [  𝔨  ,  𝔨  ]   ⊆  𝔨       𝔨  𝔨   𝔨    [\mathfrak{k},\mathfrak{k}]\subseteq\mathfrak{k}   ,     [  𝔨  ,  𝔭  ]   ⊆  𝔭       𝔨  𝔭   𝔭    [\mathfrak{k},\mathfrak{p}]\subseteq\mathfrak{p}   , and     [  𝔭  ,  𝔭  ]   ⊆  𝔨       𝔭  𝔭   𝔨    [\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{p}]\subseteq\mathfrak{k}   . Thus   𝔨   𝔨   \mathfrak{k}   is a Lie subalgebra, while any subalgebra of   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   is commutative.  Conversely, a decomposition    𝔤  =   𝔨  +  𝔭       𝔤    𝔨  𝔭     \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{k}+\mathfrak{p}   with these extra properties determines an involution   θ   θ   \theta   on   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   that is    +  1      1    +1   on   𝔨   𝔨   \mathfrak{k}   and    -  1      1    -1   on   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   .  Such a pair    (  𝔨  ,  𝔭  )     𝔨  𝔭    (\mathfrak{k},\mathfrak{p})   is also called a Cartan pair of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   , and    (  𝔤  ,  𝔨  )     𝔤  𝔨    (\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{k})   is called a symmetric pair . This notion of "Cartan pair" is not to be confused with a distinct notion involving the relative Lie algebra cohomology     H  *    (  𝔤  ,  𝔨  )        superscript  H     𝔤  𝔨     H^{*}(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{k})   .  The decomposition    𝔤  =   𝔨  +  𝔭       𝔤    𝔨  𝔭     \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{k}+\mathfrak{p}   associated to a Cartan involution is called a Cartan decomposition of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . The special feature of a Cartan decomposition is that the Killing form is negative definite on   𝔨   𝔨   \mathfrak{k}   and positive definite on   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   . Furthermore,   𝔨   𝔨   \mathfrak{k}   and   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   are orthogonal complements of each other with respect to the Killing form on   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   .  Cartan decomposition on the Lie group level  Let   G   G   G   be a semisimple  Lie group and   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   its Lie algebra . Let   θ   θ   \theta   be a Cartan involution on   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   and let    (  𝔨  ,  𝔭  )     𝔨  𝔭    (\mathfrak{k},\mathfrak{p})   be the resulting Cartan pair. Let   K   K   K   be the analytic subgroup of   G   G   G   with Lie algebra   𝔨   𝔨   \mathfrak{k}   . Then:   There is a Lie group automorphism   Θ   normal-Θ   \Theta   with differential   θ   θ   \theta   that satisfies     Θ  2   =  1       superscript  normal-Θ  2   1    \Theta^{2}=1   .  The subgroup of elements fixed by   Θ   normal-Θ   \Theta   is   K   K   K   ; in particular,   K   K   K   is a closed subgroup.  The mapping     K  ×  𝔭   →  G     normal-→    K  𝔭   G    K\times\mathfrak{p}\rightarrow G   given by     (  k  ,  X  )   ↦    k  ⋅  exp    (  X  )       maps-to   k  X      normal-⋅  k  exp   X     (k,X)\mapsto k\cdot\mathrm{exp}(X)   is a diffeomorphism.  The subgroup   K   K   K   contains the center   Z   Z   Z   of   G   G   G   , and   K   K   K   is compact modulo center, that is,    K  /  Z      K  Z    K/Z   is compact.  The subgroup   K   K   K   is the maximal subgroup of   G   G   G   that contains the center and is compact modulo center.   The automorphism   Θ   normal-Θ   \Theta   is also called global Cartan involution , and the diffeomorphism     K  ×  𝔭   →  G     normal-→    K  𝔭   G    K\times\mathfrak{p}\rightarrow G   is called global Cartan decomposition .  For the general linear group, we get    X  ↦    (   X   -  1    )   T      maps-to  X   superscript   superscript  X    1    T     X\mapsto(X^{-1})^{T}   as the Cartan involution.  A refinement of the Cartan decomposition for symmetric spaces of compact or noncompact type states that the maximal Abelian subalgebras   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   in   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   are unique up to conjugation by K . Moreover       𝔭  =    ⋃   k  ∈  K       Ad   k   ⋅  𝔞     .      𝔭    subscript     k  K     normal-⋅    Ad  k   𝔞      \displaystyle{\mathfrak{p}=\bigcup_{k\in K}\mathrm{Ad}\,k\cdot\mathfrak{a}.}     In the compact and noncompact case this Lie algebraic result implies the decomposition       G  =   K  A  K    ,      G    K  A  K     \displaystyle{G=KAK,}     where A = exp   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   . Geometrically the image of the subgroup A in G / K is a totally geodesic submanifold.  Relation to polar decomposition  Consider    𝔤   𝔩  n    (  ℝ  )       𝔤   subscript  𝔩  n   ℝ    \mathfrak{gl}_{n}(\mathbb{R})   with the Cartan involution     θ   (  X  )    =   -   X  T          θ  X      superscript  X  T      \theta(X)=-X^{T}   . Then    𝔨  =   𝔰   𝔬  n    (  ℝ  )        𝔨    𝔰   subscript  𝔬  n   ℝ     \mathfrak{k}=\mathfrak{so}_{n}(\mathbb{R})   is the real Lie algebra of skew-symmetric matrices, so that    K  =   SO   (  n  )        K    SO  n     K=\mathrm{SO}(n)   , while   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   is the subspace of symmetric matrices. Thus the exponential map is a diffeomorphism from   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   onto the space of positive definite matrices. Up to this exponential map, the global Cartan decomposition is the polar decomposition of a matrix. Notice that the polar decomposition of an invertible matrix is unique.
