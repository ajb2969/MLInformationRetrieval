   Delta (letter)      Delta (letter)   Delta (uppercase Œî , lowercase Œ¥ or ùõø ; D√©lta ; Modern Greek ) is the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet . In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 4. It was derived from the Phoenician letter  dalet . 1 Letters that come from delta include Latin  D and Cyrillic  –î .  A river delta (originally, the Nile River delta) is so named because its shape approximates the upper-case letter delta (the shape is a triangle). Despite a popular legend, this use of the word delta was not coined by Herodotus . 2  Pronunciation  In Ancient Greek , delta represented a voiced dental plosive . In Modern Greek , it represents a voiced dental fricative , like the "th" in "that" or "this". It is romanized as d or dh .  Upper case  The upper-case letter Œî can be used to denote:   Change of any changeable quantity, in mathematics and the sciences (more specifically, the difference operator ); for example, in:             y  2   -   y  1      x  2   -   x  1     =    Œî  y    Œî  x     ,           subscript  y  2    subscript  y  1       subscript  x  2    subscript  x  1         normal-Œî  y     normal-Œî  x      {y_{2}-y_{1}\over x_{2}-x_{1}}={\Delta y\over\Delta x},       the average change of y per unit x (i.e. the change of y over the change of x). Delta is the initial letter of the Greek word Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÜŒøœÅŒ¨ diaphor√° , "difference". (The small Latin letter d is used in much the same way for the notation of derivatives and differentials , which also describe change.)
