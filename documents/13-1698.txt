   Novikov's compact leaf theorem      Novikov's compact leaf theorem   In mathematics , Novikov's compact leaf theorem , named after Sergei Novikov , states that   A codimension-one foliation of a compact 3-manifold whose universal covering space is not contractible must have a compact leaf.    Novikov's compact leaf theorem for S 3  Theorem: A smooth codimension-one foliation of the 3-sphere  S 3  has a compact leaf. The leaf is a torus  T 2  bounding a solid torus with the Reeb foliation .  The theorem was proved by Sergey Novikov in 1964. Earlier Charles Ehresmann had conjectured that every smooth codimension-one foliation on S 3 had a compact leaf, which was true for all known examples; in particular, Reeb foliation had a compact leaf that was T 2 .  Novikov's compact leaf theorem for any M 3  In 1965, Novikov proved the compact leaf theorem for any M 3 :  Theorem: Let  M 3  be a closed 3-manifold with a smooth codimension-one foliation  F . Suppose any of the following conditions is satisfied:   the fundamental group      π  1    (   M  3   )        subscript  π  1    superscript  M  3     \pi_{1}(M^{3})   is finite,  the second homotopy group       π  2    (   M  3   )    ≠  0         subscript  π  2    superscript  M  3    0    \pi_{2}(M^{3})\neq 0   ,  ''there exists a leaf    L  ∈  F      L  F    L\in F   such that the map      π  1    (  L  )    →    π  1    (   M  3   )       normal-→     subscript  π  1   L      subscript  π  1    superscript  M  3      \pi_{1}(L)\to\pi_{1}(M^{3})   induced by inclusion has a non-trivial kernel .   ''  Then  F  has a compact leaf of genus  g ≤ 1.  In terms of covering spaces:  ''A codimension-one foliation of a compact 3-manifold whose universal covering space is not contractible must have a compact leaf. ''  References   S. Novikov .
