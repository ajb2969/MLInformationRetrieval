Novikov's compact leaf theorem

In mathematics, Novikov's compact leaf theorem, named after Sergei Novikov, states that

A codimension-one foliation of a compact 3-manifold whose universal covering space is not contractible must have a compact leaf.


Novikov's compact leaf theorem for S3
Theorem: A smooth codimension-one foliation of the 3-sphere S3 has a compact leaf. The leaf is a torus T2 bounding a solid torus with the Reeb foliation.
The theorem was proved by Sergey Novikov in 1964. Earlier Charles Ehresmann had conjectured that every smooth codimension-one foliation on S3 had a compact leaf, which was true for all known examples; in particular, Reeb foliation had a compact leaf that was T2.
Novikov's compact leaf theorem for any M3
In 1965, Novikov proved the compact leaf theorem for any M3:
Theorem: Let M3 be a closed 3-manifold with a smooth codimension-one foliation F. Suppose any of the following conditions is satisfied:

the fundamental group

 
  is finite,
the second homotopy group

 
 ,
''there exists a leaf 
 
 
 
  such that the map 
 
 
 
  induced by inclusion has a non-trivial kernel.

''
Then F has a compact leaf of genus g ≤ 1.
In terms of covering spaces:
''A codimension-one foliation of a compact 3-manifold whose universal covering space is not contractible must have a compact leaf. ''
