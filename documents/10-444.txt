   Xanthoxin dehydrogenase      Xanthoxin dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a xanthoxin dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   xanthoxin + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   abscisic aldehyde + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are xanthoxin and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are abscisic aldehyde , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is xanthoxin:NAD + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include xanthoxin oxidase , and ABA2 . This enzyme participates in carotenoid biosynthesis.
