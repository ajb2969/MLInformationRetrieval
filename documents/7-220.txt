   Polignac's conjecture      Polignac's conjecture   In number theory , Polignac's conjecture was made by Alphonse de Polignac in 1849 and states:   For any positive even number  n , there are infinitely many prime gaps of size n . In other words: There are infinitely many cases of two consecutive prime numbers with difference n . 1    The conjecture has not yet been proven or disproven for a given value of n . In 2013 an important breakthrough was made by Zhang Yitang who proved that there are infinitely many prime gaps of size n for some value of n  2 Later that year, James Maynard announced a related breakthrough which proved that there are infinitely many prime gaps of some size less than or equal to 600. 3 As of April 14, 2014, one year after Zhang's announcement, according to the Polymath project wiki , n has been reduced to 246. 4 Further, assuming the Elliott–Halberstam conjecture and its generalized form, the Polymath project wiki states that n has been reduced to 12 and 6, respectively. 5  For n = 2, it is the twin prime conjecture . For n = 4, it says there are infinitely many cousin primes ( p , p + 4). For n = 6, it says there are infinitely many sexy primes ( p , p + 6) with no prime between p and p + 6.  Dickson's conjecture generalizes Polignac's conjecture to cover all prime constellations.  Conjectured density  Let     π  n    (  x  )        subscript  π  n   x    \pi_{n}(x)   for even n be the number of prime gaps of size n below x .  The first Hardy–Littlewood conjecture says the asymptotic density is of form        π  n    (  x  )    ∼   2   C  n    x    (   ln  x   )   2     ∼   2   C  n     ∫  2  x     d  t     (   ln  t   )   2           similar-to     subscript  π  n   x     2   subscript  C  n     x   superscript    x   2       similar-to      2   subscript  C  n     superscript   subscript   2   x       d  t    superscript    t   2         \pi_{n}(x)\sim 2C_{n}\frac{x}{(\ln x)^{2}}\sim 2C_{n}\int_{2}^{x}{dt\over(\ln t%

 2110014\dots     where the product extends over all prime numbers p ≥ 3.  C n is C 2 multiplied by a number which depends on the odd prime factors q of n :        C  n   =    C  2     ∏   q  |  n      q  -  1    q  -  2       .       subscript  C  n      subscript  C  2     subscript  product   fragments  q  normal-|  n        q  1     q  2        C_{n}=C_{2}\prod_{q|n}\frac{q-1}{q-2}.     For example, C 4 = C 2 and C 6 = 2 C 2 . Twin primes have the same conjectured density as cousin primes, and half that of sexy primes.  Note that each odd prime factor q of n increases the conjectured density compared to twin primes by a factor of     q  -  1    q  -  2         q  1     q  2     \tfrac{q-1}{q-2}   . A heuristic argument follows. It relies on some unproven assumptions so the conclusion remains a conjecture. The chance of a random odd prime q dividing either a or a + 2 in a random "potential" twin prime pair is    2  q      2  q    \tfrac{2}{q}   , since q divides 1 of the q numbers from a to a + q − 1. Now assume q divides n and consider a potential prime pair ( a , a + n ). q divides a + n if and only if q divides a , and the chance of that is    1  q      1  q    \tfrac{1}{q}   . The chance of ( a , a + n ) being free from the factor q , divided by the chance that ( a , a + 2 ) is free from q , then becomes     q  -  1   q        q  1   q    \tfrac{q-1}{q}   divided by     q  -  2   q        q  2   q    \tfrac{q-2}{q}   . This equals     q  -  1    q  -  2         q  1     q  2     \tfrac{q-1}{q-2}   which transfers to the conjectured prime density. In the case of n = 6, the argument simplifies to: If a is a random number then 3 has chance 2/3 of dividing a or a + 2, but only chance 1/3 of dividing a and a + 6, so the latter pair is conjectured twice as likely to both be prime.
