Phenylserine aldolase

In enzymology, a phenylserine aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-threo-3-phenylserine 
 
 
 
  glycine + benzaldehyde
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-threo-3-phenylserine, and two products, glycine and benzaldehyde.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-threo-3-phenylserine benzaldehyde-lyase (glycine-forming). This enzyme is also called L-threo-3-phenylserine benzaldehyde-lyase. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
