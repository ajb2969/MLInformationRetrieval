   Disperser      Disperser   A disperser is a one-sided extractor . 1 Where an extractor requires that every event gets the same probability under the uniform distribution and the extracted distribution, only the latter is required for a disperser. So for a disperser, an event    A  ⊆    {  0  ,  1  }   m       A   superscript   0  1   m     A\subseteq\{0,1\}^{m}   we have:     P   r   U  m     [  A  ]    >   1  -  ϵ         P   subscript  r   subscript  U  m     delimited-[]  A      1  ϵ     Pr_{U_{m}}[A]>1-\epsilon     Definition (Disperser):  A     (  k  ,  ϵ  )     k  ϵ    (k,\epsilon)    -disperser is a function       D  i  s   :      {  0  ,  1  }   n   ×    {  0  ,  1  }   d    →    {  0  ,  1  }   m       normal-:    D  i  s    normal-→     superscript   0  1   n    superscript   0  1   d     superscript   0  1   m      Dis:\{0,1\}^{n}\times\{0,1\}^{d}\rightarrow\{0,1\}^{m}     such that for every distribution    X   X   X    on      {  0  ,  1  }   n     superscript   0  1   n    \{0,1\}^{n}    with       H  ∞    (  X  )    ≥  k         subscript  H    X   k    H_{\infty}(X)\geq k    the support of the distribution     D  i  s   (  X  ,   U  d   )       D  i  s   X   subscript  U  d      Dis(X,U_{d})    is of size at least      (   1  -  ϵ   )    2  m         1  ϵ    superscript  2  m     (1-\epsilon)2^{m}   .  Graph theory  An ( N , M , D , K , e )-disperser is a bipartite graph with N vertices on the left side, each with degree D , and M vertices on the right side, such that every subset of K vertices on the left side is connected to more than (1 − e ) M vertices on the right.  An extractor is a related type of graph that guarantees an even stronger property; every ( N , M , D , K , e )-extractor is also an ( N , M , D , K , e )-disperser .  Other meanings  A disperser is a high-speed mixing device used to disperse or dissolve pigments and other solids into a liquid.
