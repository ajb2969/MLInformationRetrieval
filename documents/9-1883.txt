   Hilbert–Schmidt theorem      Hilbert–Schmidt theorem   In mathematical analysis , the Hilbert–Schmidt theorem , also known as the eigenfunction expansion theorem , is a fundamental result concerning compact , self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces . In the theory of partial differential equations , it is very useful in solving elliptic  boundary value problems .  Statement of the theorem  Let ( H , 〈 , 〉) be a real or complex Hilbert space and let A : H → H be a bounded , compact, self-adjoint operator. Then there is a sequence of non-zero real eigenvalues  λ i , i = 1, ..., N , with N equal to the rank of A , such that | λ i | is monotonically non-increasing and, if N = +∞,        lim   i  →   +  ∞      λ  i    =  0.        subscript    normal-→  i         subscript  λ  i    0.    \lim_{i\to+\infty}\lambda_{i}=0.     Furthermore, if each eigenvalue of A is repeated in the sequence according to its multiplicity , then there exists an orthonormal set φ i , i = 1, ..., N , of corresponding eigenfunctions, i.e.         A   φ  i    =    λ  i    φ  i   for  i   =  1   ,   …  ,  N    .     formulae-sequence        A   subscript  φ  i       subscript  λ  i    subscript  φ  i   for  i        1     normal-…  N     A\varphi_{i}=\lambda_{i}\varphi_{i}\mbox{ for }i=1,\dots,N.     Moreover, the functions φ i form an orthonormal basis for the range of A and A can be written as        A  u   =    ∑   i  =  1   N     λ  i    ⟨   φ  i   ,  u  ⟩    φ  i   for all  u    ∈  H   .          A  u     superscript   subscript     i  1    N      subscript  λ  i     subscript  φ  i   u    subscript  φ  i   for all  u         H     Au=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}\langle\varphi_{i},u\rangle\varphi_{i}\mbox{ for %
