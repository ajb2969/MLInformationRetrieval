(+)-Caryolan-1-ol synthase

(+)-Caryolan-1-ol synthase (, GcoA) is an enzyme with systematic name (+)-beta-caryophyllene hydrolase (cyclizing, (+)-caryolan-1-ol-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(+)-beta-caryophyllene + H2O 
 
 
 
  (+)-caryolan-1-ol
 

This enzyme also forms (+)-beta-caryophyllene from farnesyl diphosphate (EC 4.2.3.89).
