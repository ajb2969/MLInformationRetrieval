   Dual object      Dual object   In category theory , a branch of mathematics , it is possible to define a concept of dual object generalizing the concept of dual space in linear algebra .  A category in which each object has a dual is called autonomous or rigid .  Definition  Consider an object   X   X   X   in a monoidal category     (  ùêÇ  ,  ‚äó  ,  I  ,  Œ±  ,  Œª  ,  œÅ  )     ùêÇ  tensor-product  I  Œ±  Œª  œÅ    (\mathbf{C},\otimes,I,\alpha,\lambda,\rho)   . The object    X  *     superscript  X     X^{*}   is called a left dual of   X   X   X   if there exist two morphsims      Œ∑  :   I  ‚Üí   X  ‚äó   X  *        normal-:  Œ∑   normal-‚Üí  I   tensor-product  X   superscript  X        \eta:I\to X\otimes X^{*}   , called the coevaluation , and    Œµ  :     X  *   ‚äó  X   ‚Üí  I      normal-:  Œµ   normal-‚Üí   tensor-product   superscript  X    X   I     \varepsilon:X^{*}\otimes X\to I   , called the evaluation , such that the following two diagrams commute     (Figure)  Dual-one.png    and  (Figure)  Dual-two.png      The object   X   X   X   is called the right dual of    X  *     superscript  X     X^{*}   . Left duals are canonically isomorphic when they exist, as are right duals. When C is braided (or symmetric ), every left dual is also a right dual, and vice versa.  If we consider a monoidal category as a bicategory with one object, a dual pair is exactly an adjoint pair .  Categories with duals  A monoidal category where every object has a left (resp. right) dual is sometimes called a left (resp. right) autonomous category. Algebraic geometers call it a left (resp. right) rigid category . A monoidal category where every object has both a left and a right dual is called an autonomous category . An autonomous category that is also symmetric is called a compact closed category .  See also   Dualizing object   References      "  Category:Monoidal categories
