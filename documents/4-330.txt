Alexander–Spanier cohomology

In mathematics, particularly in algebraic topology, Alexander–Spanier cohomology is a cohomology theory for topological spaces.
History
It was introduced by  for the special case of compact metric spaces, and by  for all topological spaces, based on a suggestion of A. D. Wallace.
Definition
If X is a topological space and G is an abelian group, then there is a complex C whose pth term Cp is the set of all functions from Xp+1 to G with differential d given by



It has a subcomplex C0 of functions that vanish in a neighborhood of the diagonal. The Alexander–Spanier cohomology groups Hp(X,G) are defined to be the cohomology groups of the complex C/C0.
Variants
It is also possible to define Alexander–Spanier homology  and Alexander–Spanier cohomology with compact supports .
Connection to other cohomologies
The Alexander–Spanier cohomology groups coincide with Čech cohomology groups for compact Hausdorff spaces, and coincide with singular cohomology groups for locally finite complexes.
