Generalized singular value decomposition

In linear algebra, the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) is the name of two different techniques based on the singular value decomposition. The two versions differ because one version decomposes two (or more) matrices (much like higher order PCA) and the other version uses a set of constraints imposed on the left and right singular vectors.
Higher order version
The generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) is a matrix decomposition more general than the singular value decomposition. It is used to study the conditioning and regularization of linear systems with respect to quadratic semi-norms.
Let 
 
 
 
 , or 
 
 
 
 . Given matrices 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 , their GSVD is given by


 
  and



where 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are unitary matrices, and 
 
 
 
 
  is non-singular, where 
 
 
 
 . Also, 
 
 
 
  is non-negative diagonal, and 
 
 
 
  is non-negative block-diagonal, with diagonal blocks; 
 
 
 
  is not always diagonal. It holds that 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and that 
 
 
 
 . This implies 
 
 
 
 . The ratios 
 
 
 
  are called the generalized singular values of 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is square and invertible, then the generalized singular values are the singular values, and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the matrices of singular vectors, of the matrix 
 
 
 
 
 . Further, if 
 
 
 
 , then the GSVD reduces to the singular value decomposition, explaining the name.
Weighted version
The weighted version of the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) is a constrained matrix decomposition with constraints imposed on the left and right singular vectors of the singular value decomposition.123 This form of the GSVD is an extension of the SVD as such. Given the SVD of an m×n real or complex matrix M


 
  where


 
  Where I is the Identity Matrix and where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are orthonormal given their constraints (
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ). Additionally, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are positive definite matrices (often diagonal matrices of weights). This form of the GSVD is the core of certain techniques, such as generalized principal component analysis and Correspondence analysis.
The weighted form of the GSVD is called as such because, with the correct selection of weights, it generalizes many techniques (such as multidimensional scaling and linear discriminant analysis)4
Applications
The GSVD has been successfully applied to signal processing and big data, e.g., in genomic signal processing.56 These applications also inspired a higher-order GSVD (HO GSVD)7 and a tensor GSVD.8
