   Sorbose 5-dehydrogenase (NADP+)      Sorbose 5-dehydrogenase (NADP+)   In enzymology , a sorbose 5-dehydrogenase (NADP + ) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-sorbose + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-dehydro-D-fructose + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-sorbose and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 5-dehydro-D-fructose , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-sorbose:NADP + 5-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 5-ketofructose reductase , 5-keto-D-fructose reductase , sorbose (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) dehydrogenase , reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-linked , reductase , and sorbose 5-dehydrogenase (NADP + ) .
