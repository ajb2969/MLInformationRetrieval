1,2-dihydroxy-6-methylcyclohexa-3,5-dienecarboxylate dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a 1,2-dihydroxy-6-methylcyclohexa-3,5-dienecarboxylate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1,2-dihydroxy-6-methylcyclohexa-3,5-dienecarboxylate + NAD+

 
  3-methylcatechol + NADH + CO2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1,2-dihydroxy-6-methylcyclohexa-3,5-dienecarboxylate and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are 3-methylcatechol, NADH, and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,2-dihydroxy-6-methylcyclohexa-3,5-dienecarboxylate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating). This enzyme participates in toluene and xylene degradation.
