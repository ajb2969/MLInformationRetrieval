Hyper basis function network

In machine learning, a Hyper basis function network, or HyperBF network, is a generalization of radial basis function (RBF) networks concept, where the Mahalanobis-like distance is used instead of Euclidean distance measure. Hyper basis function networks were first introduced by Poggio and Girosi in the 1990 paper “Networks for Approximation and Learning”.12
Network Architecture
The typical HyperBF network structure consists of a real input vector 
 
 
 
 , a hidden layer of activation functions and a linear output layer. The output of the network is a scalar function of the input vector, 
 
 
 
 , is given by





where 
 
 
 
 
  is a number of neurons in the hidden layer, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the center and weight of neuron 
 
 
 
 . The activation function

 
  at the HyperBF network takes the following form





where 
 
 
 
  is a positive definite 
 
 
 
  matrix. Depending on the application, the following types of matrices 
 
 
 
  are usually considered3



 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
 . This case corresponds to the regular RBF network.


 
 , where 
 
 
 
 . In this case, the basis functions are radially symmetric, but are scaled with different width.


 
 , where 
 
 
 
 . Every neuron has an elliptic shape with a varying size.
Positive definite matrix, but not diagonal.

Training
Training HyperBF networks involves estimation of weights 
 
 
 
 
 , shape and centers of neurons 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Poggio and Girosi (1990) describe the training method with moving centers and adaptable neuron shapes. The outline of the method is provided below.
Consider the quadratic loss of the network 
 
 
 
 . The following conditions must be satisfied at the optimum:



 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 


where 
 
 
 
 . Then in the gradient descent method the values of 
 
 
 
  that minimize 
 
 
 
  can be found as a stable fixed point of the following dynamic system:



 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 


where 
 
 
 
  determines the rate of convergence.
Overall, training HyperBF networks can be computationally challenging. Moreover, the high degree of freedom of HyperBF leads to overfitting and poor generalization. However, HyperBF networks have an important advantage that a small number of neurons is enough for learning complex functions.4
