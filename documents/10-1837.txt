   Estrone sulfotransferase      Estrone sulfotransferase   In enzymology , an estrone sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + estrone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + estrone 3-sulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and estrone , whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and estrone 3-sulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , to be specific, the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:estrone 3-sulfotransferase . Other names in common use include 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate-estrone 3-sulfotransferase , estrogen sulfotransferase , estrogen sulphotransferase , oestrogen sulphotransferase , and 3'-phosphoadenylylsulfate:oestrone sulfotransferase . This enzyme participates in androgen and estrogen metabolism and sulfur metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
