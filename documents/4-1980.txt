   Triangular orthobicupola      Triangular orthobicupola   In geometry , the triangular orthobicupola is one of the Johnson solids ( J 27 ). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by attaching two triangular cupolas ( J 3 ) along their bases. It has an equal number of squares and triangles at each vertex; however, it is not vertex-transitive . It is also called an anticuboctahedron .  The triangular orthobicupola is the first in an infinite set of orthobicupolae .  The triangular orthobicupola has a superficial resemblance to the cuboctahedron , which would be known as the triangular gyrobicupola in the nomenclature of Johnson solids — the difference is that the two triangular cupolas which make up the triangular orthobicupola are joined so that pairs of matching sides abut (hence, "ortho"); the cuboctahedron is joined so that triangles abut squares and vice versa. Given a triangular orthobicupola, a 60-degree rotation of one cupola before the joining yields a cuboctahedron. Hence, another name for the triangular orthobicupola is the anticuboctahedron .  The elongated triangular orthobicupola ( J 35 ), which is constructed by elongating this solid, has a (different) special relationship with the rhombicuboctahedron .  The dual of the triangular orthobicupola is the trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron . It has 6 rhombic and 6 trapezoidal faces, and is similar to the rhombic dodecahedron .  Formulae  The following formulae for volume , surface area , and circumradius can be used if all faces are regular , with edge length a : 1     V  =     5   2    3    a  3    ≈   2.35702...   a  3          V        5    2    3    superscript  a  3           2.35702...   superscript  a  3       V=\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{3}a^{3}\approx 2.35702...a^{3}       A  =   2   (   3  +   3    )    a  2    ≈   9.4641...   a  2          A    2    3    3     superscript  a  2           9.4641...   superscript  a  2       A=2(3+\sqrt{3})a^{2}\approx 9.4641...a^{2}     The circumradius of a triangular orthobicupola is the same as the edge length (C=a).
