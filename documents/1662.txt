   Paul C. Yang      Paul C. Yang   Paul C. Yang is a Chinese-American  mathematician specializing in differential geometry and partial differential equations . He is most well known for his work in conformal geometry, his study of extremal metrics and his research on scalar curvature and Q-curvature.  Career  Yang earned his doctorate at the University of California, Berkeley in 1973 under the supervision of Hung-Hsi Wu. 1 He held positions at Rice University , the University of Maryland , Indiana University and the University of Southern California before taking his current position as professor at Princeton University in 2001. 2  Awards and honors  Yang was a Sloan Foundation Fellow in 1981. 3 In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society . 4  Selected publications   Chang, Sun-Yung A.; Yang, Paul C.
