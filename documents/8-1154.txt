   Deal or No Deal (Netherlands)      Deal or No Deal (Netherlands)   Deal or No Deal (officially Postcodeloterij: Deal or No Deal ) is a Dutch version of Deal or No Deal . The show is similar to Miljoenenjacht , the original version of Deal or No Deal ; however, it does not have any of the extra quiz rounds that Miljoenenjacht has, so this direct version contains the familiar format first used in the Australian version and then around the world. Deal or No Deal is sponsored by the Dutch National Postcode Lottery and is shown on RTL 5 . (Both versions were shown on Tien before its termination.)  There are three main differences between the direct and parent versions. One is the top prize is much smaller, which is €250,000,    1  20      1  20    \tfrac{1}{20}   of the €5,000,000 prize in Miljoenenjacht . Also, the counterpart of Linda de Mol , the host of Miljoenenjacht , in this version is Beau van Erven Dorens . Furthermore, instead of 26 briefcases, the game uses 20 boxes, each representing a region of the Netherlands. This box variation is also used in some versions of the franchise, such as the UK version . In round 1 the contestant opens 6 boxes, and 3 in all other rounds. The box values, in euros , are as follows (the euro sign is not used in the values board):       €1     €5     €10     €20     €50     €100     €200     €300     €400     €500           €1,000     €5,000     €10,000     €20,000     €30,000     €40,000     €50,000     €100,000     €125,000     €250,000      External links   Official website  official page on RTL 5   "  Category:Deal or No Deal  Category:Dutch game shows  Category:2006 Dutch television series debuts
