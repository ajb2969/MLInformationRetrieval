Rastrigin function

In mathematical optimization, the Rastrigin function is a non-convex function used as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms. It is a typical example of non-linear multimodal function. It was first proposed by Rastrigin 1 as a 2-dimensional function and has been generalized by Mühlenbein et al.2 Finding the minimum of this function is a fairly difficult problem due to its large search space and its large number of local minima.
It is defined by:
