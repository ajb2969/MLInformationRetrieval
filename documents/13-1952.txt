   Rastrigin function      Rastrigin function   In mathematical optimization , the Rastrigin function is a non- convex function used as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms . It is a typical example of non-linear multimodal function. It was first proposed by Rastrigin 1 as a 2-dimensional function and has been generalized by Mühlenbein et al. 2 Finding the minimum of this function is a fairly difficult problem due to its large search space and its large number of local minima .  It is defined by:       f   (  𝐱  )    =    A  n   +    ∑   i  =  1   n    [    x  i  2   -   A   cos   (   2  π   x  i    )      ]           f  𝐱       A  n     superscript   subscript     i  1    n    delimited-[]     superscript   subscript  x  i   2     A      2  π   subscript  x  i            f(\mathbf{x})=An+\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[x_{i}^{2}-A\cos(2\pi x_{i})\right]   where    A  =  10      A  10    A=10   and     x  i   ∈   [   -  5.12   ,  5.12  ]        subscript  x  i      5.12   5.12     x_{i}\in[-5.12,5.12]   . It has a global minimum at    𝐱  =  𝟎      𝐱  0    \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}   where     f   (  𝐱  )    =  0        f  𝐱   0    f(\mathbf{x})=0   .
