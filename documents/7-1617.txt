   Leyland number      Leyland number   In number theory , a Leyland number is a number of the form       x  y   +   y  x        superscript  x  y    superscript  y  x     x^{y}+y^{x}   where x and y are integers greater than 1. 1 They are named after the mathematician Paul Leyland . The first few Leyland numbers are   8 , 17 , 32 , 54 , 57 , 100 , 145 , 177 , 320 , 368 , 512 , 593 , 945 , 1124 .   The requirement that x and y both be greater than 1 is important, since without it every positive integer would be a Leyland number of the form x 1 + 1 x . Also, because of the commutative property of addition, the condition x ≥ y is usually added to avoid double-covering the set of Leyland numbers (so we have 1 2+2 3 , 9 2 +2 9 , 15 2 +2 15 , 21 2 +2 21 , 33 2 +2 33 , 24 5 +5 24 , 56 3 +3 56 , 32 15 +15 32 . 2  One can also fix the value of y and consider the sequence of x values that gives Leyland primes, for example x 2 + 2 x is prime for x = 3, 9, 15, 21, 33, 2007, 2127, 3759, ... ().  By November 2012, the largest Leyland number that had been proven to be prime was 5122 6753 + 6753 5122 with 25050 digits. From January 2011 to April 2011, it was the largest prime whose primality was proved by elliptic curve primality proving . 3 In December 2012, this was improved by proving the primality of the two numbers 3110 63 + 63 3110 (5596 digits) and 8656 2929 + 2929 8656 (30008 digits), the latter of which surpassed the previous record. 4 There are many larger known probable primes such as 314738 9 + 9 314738 , 5 but it is hard to prove primality of large Leyland numbers. Paul Leyland writes on his website: "More recently still, it was realized that numbers of this form are ideal test cases for general purpose primality proving programs. They have a simple algebraic description but no obvious cyclotomic properties which special purpose algorithms can exploit."  There is a project called XYYXF to factor  composite Leyland numbers. 6   References  External links     "  Category:Integer sequences     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  Henri Lifchitz & Renaud Lifchitz, [ http://www.primenumbers.net/prptop/searchform.php?form=x%5Ey%2By%5Ex&action; ;=Search PRP Top Records search]. ↩  ↩
