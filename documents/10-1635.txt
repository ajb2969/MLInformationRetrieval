Cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase

In enzymology, a cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

cycloeucalenol 
 
 
 
  obtusifoliol
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, cycloeucalenol, and one product, obtusifoliol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically the class of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cycloeucalenol lyase (cyclopropane-decyclizing). This enzyme is also called cycloeucalenol---obtusifoliol isomerase. This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of steroids.
