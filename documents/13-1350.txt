Peres metric

In mathematical physics, the Peres metric is defined by the proper time



for any arbitrary function f. If f is a harmonic function with respect to x and y, then the corresponding Peres metric satisfies the Einstein field equations in vacuum. Such a metric is often studied in the context of gravitational waves. The metric is named for Israeli physicist Asher Peres, who first defined the metric in 1959.
