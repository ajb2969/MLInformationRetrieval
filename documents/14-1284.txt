   Tug of war (astronomy)      Tug of war (astronomy)   The tug of war in astronomy is the ratio of planetary and solar attractions on a natural satellite . The term was coined by Isaac Asimov in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in 1963. 1  Law of universal gravitation  According to Isaac Newton 's law of universal gravitation      F  =   G  ⋅     m  1   ⋅   m  2     d  2         F   normal-⋅  G     normal-⋅   subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2     superscript  d  2       F=G\cdot\frac{m_{1}\cdot m_{2}}{d^{2}}     In this equation   F is the force of attraction  G is the gravitational constant   m 1 and m 2 are the masses of two bodies  d is the distance between the two bodies   The two main attraction forces on a satellite are the attraction of the Sun and the satellite's primary (the planet the satellite orbits). Therefore, the two forces are       F  p   =    G  ⋅  m  ⋅   M  p     d  p  2         subscript  F  p      normal-⋅  G  m   subscript  M  p     superscript   subscript  d  p   2      F_{p}=\frac{G\cdot m\cdot M_{p}}{d_{p}^{2}}          F  s   =    G  ⋅  m  ⋅   M  s     d  s  2         subscript  F  s      normal-⋅  G  m   subscript  M  s     superscript   subscript  d  s   2      F_{s}=\frac{G\cdot m\cdot M_{s}}{d_{s}^{2}}   where the subscripts p and s represent the primary and the sun respectively, and m is the mass of the satellite.  The ratio of the two is        F  p    F  s    =     M  p   ⋅   d  s  2      M  s   ⋅   d  p  2            subscript  F  p    subscript  F  s       normal-⋅   subscript  M  p    superscript   subscript  d  s   2     normal-⋅   subscript  M  s    superscript   subscript  d  p   2       \frac{F_{p}}{F_{s}}=\frac{M_{p}\cdot d_{s}^{2}}{M_{s}\cdot d_{p}^{2}}     Example  Callisto is a satellite of Jupiter . The parameters in the equation are 2   Callisto–Jupiter distance (d p ) is 1.883 · 10 6 km.  Mass of Jupiter (M p ) is 1.9 · 10 27 kg  Jupiter–Sun distance (i.e. mean distance of Callisto from the Sun, d s ) is 778.3 · 10 6 km.  The solar mass (M s ) is 1.989 · 10 30 kg         F  p    F  s    =    1.9  ⋅   10  27   ⋅    (  778.3  )   2     1.989  ⋅   10  30   ⋅    (  1.883  )   2     ≈  163           subscript  F  p    subscript  F  s       normal-⋅  1.9   superscript  10  27    superscript  778.3  2     normal-⋅  1.989   superscript  10  30    superscript  1.883  2          163     \frac{F_{p}}{F_{s}}=\frac{1.9\cdot 10^{27}\cdot(778.3)^{2}}{1.989\cdot 10^{30}%
 \cdot(1.883)^{2}}\approx 163     The table of planets  Asimov lists tug-of-war ratio for 32 satellites (then known in 1963) of Solar System. The list below shows one example from each planet.      Primary   Satellite   Tug-of-war ratio       Neptune   Triton   8400     Uranus   Titania   1750     Saturn   Titan   380     Jupiter   Ganymede   490     Mars   Phobos   195     Earth   Moon   0.46     The special case of the Moon  Unlike other satellites of the solar system solar attraction on the Moon is more than that of its primary. According to Asimov, the Moon is a planet moving around the Sun in careful step with the Earth. 3  References  "  Category:Moons  Category:Gravitation  Category:Astronomical dynamical systems     Isaac Asimov: Asimov on Astronomy Coronet Books,1976, ISBN 0-340-20015-4 pp125-139 ↩  Thomas Arny: Explorations , Mc Graw Hill, ISBN 0-07-561112-0 pp.543-545 ↩
