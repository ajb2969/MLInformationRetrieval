Quadratic differential

In mathematics, a quadratic differential on a Riemann surface is a section of the symmetric square of the holomorphic cotangent bundle. If the section is holomorphic, then the quadratic differential is said to be holomorphic. The vector space of holomorphic quadratic differentials on a Riemann surface has a natural interpretation as the cotangent space to the Riemann moduli space or Teichmueller space.
Local form
Each quadratic differential on a domain 
 
 
 
  in the complex plane may be written as 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the complex variable and 
 
 
 
  is a complex valued function on 
 
 
 
 . Such a `local' quadratic differential is holomorphic if and only if 
 
 
 
  is holomorphic. Given a chart 
 
 
 
  for a general Riemann surface 
 
 
 
  and a quadratic differential 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , the pull-back

 
  defines a quadratic differential on a domain in the complex plane.
Relation to abelian differentials
If 
 
 
 
  is an abelian differential on a Riemann surface, then 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic differential.
Singular Euclidean structure
A holomorphic quadratic differential 
 
 
 
  determines a Riemannian metric

 
  on the complement of its zeroes. If 
 
 
 
  is defined on a domain in the complex plane and 
 
 
 
 , then the associated Riemannian metric is 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  is holomorphic, the curvature of this metric is zero. Thus, a holomorphic quadratic differential defines a flat metric on the complement of the set of 
 
 
 
  such that
