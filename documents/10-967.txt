   Chlorate reductase      Chlorate reductase   In enzymology , a chlorate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   AH 2 + chlorate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   A + H 2 O + chlorite   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are a reduced electron acceptor (denoted AH 2 ) and chlorate , whereas its 3 products are an oxidized electron acceptor (denoted A), water , and chlorite . It is closely related to the enzyme perchlorate reductase which reduces both chlorate and perchlorate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases . The systematic name of this enzyme class is chlorite:acceptor oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called chlorate reductase C .
