   Hyperbolic geometric graph      Hyperbolic geometric graph   A hyperbolic geometric graph (HGG) or hyperbolic geometric network (HGN) is special spatial network where nodes are (1) sprinkled according to a probability distribution onto a hyperbolic space of constant negative curvature and (2) an edge between two nodes is present if they are close according to a function of the metric , 1 2 a HGG generalizes a random geometric graph (RGG) whose embedding space is Euclidean.  Mathematical formulation  Mathematically, a HGG is a graph     G   (  V  ,  E  )       G   V  E     G(V,E)   with a vertex set  V ( cardinality     N  =   |  V  |       N    V     N=|V|   ) and a edge set E constructed by considering the nodes as points placed onto a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space    ℍ  ζ  2     subscript   superscript  ℍ  2   ζ    \mathbb{H}^{2}_{\zeta}   of constant negative Gaussian curvature ,    -   ζ  2        superscript  ζ  2     -\zeta^{2}   and cut-off radius   R   R   R   , i.e. the radius of the Poincaré disk which can be visualized using a hyperboloid model . Each point   i   i   i   has hyperbolic polar coordinates    (   r  i   ,   θ  i   )      subscript  r  i    subscript  θ  i     (r_{i},\theta_{i})   with    0  ≤   r  i   ≤  R        0   subscript  r  i        R     0\leq r_{i}\leq R   and    0  ≤   θ  i   <   2  π         0   subscript  θ  i          2  π      0\leq\theta_{i}<2\pi   .  The hyperbolic law of cosines allows to measure the distance    d   i  j      subscript  d    i  j     d_{ij}   between two points   i   i   i   and   j   j   j   , 3       cosh   (   ζ   d   i  j     )    =    cosh   (   ζ   r  i    )     cosh   (   ζ   r  j    )             ζ   subscript  d    i  j            ζ   subscript  r  i         ζ   subscript  r  j        \cosh(\zeta d_{ij})=\cosh(\zeta r_{i})\cosh(\zeta r_{j})        -    sinh   (   ζ   r  i    )     sinh   (   ζ   r  j    )     cos   (      π   -   |   π  -   |     θ  i    -   θ  j    |    |    ⏟   Δ   )      .            ζ   subscript  r  i         ζ   subscript  r  j        subscript   normal-⏟    π      π       subscript  θ  i    subscript  θ  j         normal-Δ       -\sinh(\zeta r_{i})\sinh(\zeta r_{j})\cos\bigg(\underbrace{\pi\!-\!\bigg|\pi-|%
 \theta_{i}\!-\!\theta_{j}|\bigg|}_{\Delta}\bigg).   The angle   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   is the (smallest) angle between the two position vectors .  In the simplest case, an edge    (  i  ,  j  )     i  j    (i,j)   is established iff (if and only if) two nodes are within a certain neighborhood radius    r   r   r   ,     d   i  j    ≤  r       subscript  d    i  j    r    d_{ij}\leq r   , this corresponds to an influence threshold.  Connectivity decay function  In general, a link will be established with a probability depending on the distance    d   i  j      subscript  d    i  j     d_{ij}   . A connectivity decay function      γ   (  s  )    :    ℝ  +   →   [  0  ,  1  ]       normal-:    γ  s    normal-→   superscript  ℝ     0  1      \gamma(s):\mathbb{R}^{+}\to[0,1]   represents the probability of assigning an edge to a pair of nodes at distance   s   s   s   . In this framework, the simple case of hard-code neighborhood like in random geometric graphs is referred to as truncation decay function . 4  Findings  For    ζ  =  1      ζ  1    \zeta=1   (Gaussian curvature    K  =   -  1       K    1     K=-1   ), HGGs form an ensemble of networks for which is possible to express the degree distribution  analytically as closed form for the limiting case of large number of nodes. 5 This is worth mentioning since this is not true for many ensemble of graphs.  Applications  HGGs have been suggested as promising model for social networks where the hyperbolicity appears through a competition between similarity and popularity of an individual. 6  References  "  Category:Networks  Category:Network theory  Category:Graph theory  Category:Graph families  Category:Hyperbolic geometry     ↩  ↩   ↩   ↩
