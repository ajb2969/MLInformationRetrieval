Electron-longitudinal acoustic phonon interaction

Electron-longitudinal acoustic phonon interaction is an equation concerning atoms.
Displacement operator of the longitudinal acoustic phonon
The equation of motions of the atoms of mass M which locates in the periodic lattice is


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the displacement of the nth atom from their equilibrium positions.
If we define the displacement 
 
 
 
  of the nth atom by 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the coordinates of the lth atom and a is the lattice size,
the displacement is given by 
 
 

Using Fourier transform, we can define



and


 
 .
Since 
 
 
 
  is a Hermite operator,



From the definition of the creation and annihilation operator 
 
 



 
  is written as



Then 
 
 
 
  expressed as



Hence, when we use continuum model, the displacement for the 3-dimensional case is


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the unit vector along the displacement direction.
Interaction Hamiltonian
The electron-longitudinal acoustic phonon interaction Hamiltonian is defined as 




 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the deformation potential for electron scattering by acoustic phonons.1
Inserting the displacement vector to the Hamiltonian results to



Scattering probability
The scattering probability for electrons from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  states is






Replace the integral over the whole space with a summation of unit cell integrations



where 
 
 
 
 , 

 is the volume of a unit cell.
