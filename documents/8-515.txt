   √âtale topology      √âtale topology   In algebraic geometry , the √©tale topology is a Grothendieck topology on the category of schemes which has properties similar to the Euclidean topology, but unlike the Euclidean topology, it is also defined in positive characteristic. The √©tale topology was originally introduced by Grothendieck to define √©tale cohomology , and this is still the √©tale topology's most well-known use.  Definitions  For any scheme X , let √ât( X ) be the category of all √©tale morphisms from a scheme to X . This is the analog of the category of open subsets of X (that is, the category whose objects are varieties and whose morphisms are open immersions ). Its objects can be informally thought of as √©tale open subsets of X . The intersection of two objects corresponds to their fibered product over X . √ât( X ) is a large category, meaning that its objects do not form a set.  An √©tale presheaf on X is a contravariant functor from √ât( X ) to the category of sets. A presheaf F is called an √©tale sheaf if it satisfies the analog of the usual gluing condition for sheaves on topological spaces. That is, F is an √©tale sheaf if and only if the following condition is true. Suppose that  is an object of √ât( X ) and that is a jointly surjective family of √©tale morphisms over X . For each i , choose a section x i of F over U i . The projection map , which is loosely speaking the inclusion of the intersection of U i and U j in U i , induces a restriction map . If for all i and j the restrictions of x i and x j to are equal, then there must exist a unique section x of F over U which restricts to x i for all i .  Suppose that X is a Noetherian scheme. An abelian √©tale sheaf F on X is called finite locally constant if it is a representable functor which can be represented by an √©tale cover of X . It is called constructible if X can be covered by a finite family of subschemes on each of which the restriction of F is finite locally constant. It is called torsion if F ( U ) is a torsion group for all √©tale covers U of X . Finite locally constant sheaves are constructible, and constructible sheaves are torsion. Every torsion sheaf is a filtered inductive limit of constructible sheaves.  Grothendieck originally introduced the machinery of Grothendieck topologies and topoi to define the √©tale topology. In this language, the definition of the √©tale topology is succinct but abstract: It is the topology generated by the pretopology whose covering families are jointly surjective families of √©tale morphisms. The '''small √©tale site of X ''' is the category O ( X √©t ) whose objects are schemes U with a fixed √©tale morphism U ‚Üí X . The morphisms are morphisms of schemes compatible with the fixed maps to X . The '''big √©tale site of X ''' is the category √ât/X , that is, the category of schemes with a fixed map to X , considered with the √©tale topology.  The √©tale topology can be defined using slightly less data. First, notice that the √©tale topology is finer than the Zariski topology. Consequently, to define an √©tale cover of a scheme X , it suffices to first cover X by open affine subschemes, that is, to take a Zariski cover, and then to define an √©tale cover of an affine scheme. An √©tale cover of an affine scheme X can be defined as a surjective family { u Œ± : X Œ± ‚Üí X } such that the set of all Œ± is finite, each X Œ± is affine, and each u Œ± is √©tale. Then an √©tale cover of X is a family { u Œ± : X Œ± ‚Üí X } which becomes an √©tale cover after base changing to any open affine subscheme of X .  Local rings in the √©tale topology  Let X be a scheme with its √©tale topology, and fix a point x of X . In the Zariski topology, the stalk of X at x is computed by taking a direct limit of the sections of the structure sheaf over all the Zariski open neighborhoods of x . In the √©tale topology, there are strictly more open neighborhoods of x , so the correct analog of the local ring at x is formed by taking the limit over a strictly larger family. The correct analog of the local ring at x for the √©tale topology turns out to be the strict henselization of the local ring    ùí™   X  ,  x      subscript  ùí™   X  x     \mathcal{O}_{X,x}   . It is usually denoted    ùí™   X  ,  x   sh     superscript   subscript  ùí™   X  x    sh    \mathcal{O}_{X,x}^{\text{sh}}   .
