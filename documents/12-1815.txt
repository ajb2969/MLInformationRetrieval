   Delta-functor      Delta-functor   In homological algebra , a δ-functor between two abelian categories  A and B is a collection of functors from A to B together with a collection of morphisms that satisfy properties generalising those of derived functors . A universal δ-functor is a δ-functor satisfying a specific universal property related to extending morphisms beyond "degree 0". These notions were introduced by Alexander Grothendieck in his " Tohoku paper " to provide an appropriate setting for derived functors. 1 In particular, derived functors are universal δ-functors.  The terms homological δ-functor and cohomological δ-functor are sometimes used to distinguish between the case where the morphisms "go down" ( homological ) and the case where they "go up" ( cohomological ). In particular, one of these modifiers should always be used, but is often dropped.  Definition  Given two abelian categories A and B a covariant cohomological δ-functor between A and B is a family { T n } of covariant  additive functors  T n : A → B  indexed by the non-negative integers , and for each short exact sequence      0  →   M  ′   →  M  →   M  ′′   →  0       normal-→  0   superscript  M  normal-′     normal-→    M    normal-→     superscript  M  ′′     normal-→    0     0\rightarrow M^{\prime}\rightarrow M\rightarrow M^{\prime\prime}\rightarrow 0   a family of morphisms       δ  n   :     T  n    (   M  ′′   )    →    T   n  +  1     (   M  ′   )        normal-:   superscript  δ  n    normal-→     superscript  T  n    superscript  M  ′′       superscript  T    n  1     superscript  M  normal-′       \delta^{n}:T^{n}(M^{\prime\prime})\rightarrow T^{n+1}(M^{\prime})   indexed by the non-negative integers satisfying the following two properties:  1. For each short exact sequence as above, there is a long exact sequence      2. For each morphism of short exact sequences      and for each non-negative n , the induced square      is commutative (the δ n on the top is that corresponding to the short exact sequence of M 's whereas the one on the bottom corresponds to the short exact sequence of N 's).  The second property expresses the functoriality of a δ-functor. The modifier "cohomological" indicates that the δ n raise the index on the T . A covariant homological δ-functor between A and B is similarly defined (and generally uses subscripts), but with δ n a morphism T n ( M '') → T n-1 ( M '). The notions of contravariant cohomological δ-functor between A and B and contravariant homological δ-functor between A and B can also be defined by "reversing the arrows" accordingly.  Morphisms of δ-functors  A morphism of δ-functors is a family of natural transformations that, for each short exact sequence, commute with the morphisms δ. For example, in the case of two covariant cohomological δ-functors denoted S and T , a morphism from S to T is a family F n : S n → T n of natural transformations such that for every short exact sequence      0  →   M  ′   →  M  →   M  ′′   →  0       normal-→  0   superscript  M  normal-′     normal-→    M    normal-→     superscript  M  ′′     normal-→    0     0\rightarrow M^{\prime}\rightarrow M\rightarrow M^{\prime\prime}\rightarrow 0   the following diagram commutes:      Universal δ-functor  A universal δ-functor is characterized by the ( universal ) property that giving a morphism from it to any other δ-functor (between A and B ) is equivalent to giving just F 0 . For example, if S denotes a covariant cohomological δ-functor between A and B , then S is universal if given any other (covariant cohomological) δ-functor T (between A and B ), and given any natural transformation       F  0   :    S  0   →   T  0       normal-:   subscript  F  0    normal-→   superscript  S  0    superscript  T  0      F_{0}:S^{0}\rightarrow T^{0}   there is a unique sequence F n indexed by the positive integers such that the family { F n } n ≥ 0 is a morphism of δ-functors.
