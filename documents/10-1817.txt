3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase

In enzymology, a 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-mercaptopyruvate + cyanide 
 
 
 
  pyruvate + thiocyanate
 
3-mercaptopyruvate + thiol 
 
 
 
  pyruvate + hydrogen sulfide
 

This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the sulfurtransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-mercaptopyruvate:cyanide sulfurtransferase. This enzyme is also called beta-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. This enzyme participates in cysteine metabolism.
Structural studies
