Copositive matrix

In mathematics, specifically linear algebra, a real matrix A is copositive if


 
  for every nonnegative vector 
 
 
 
 . The collection of all copositive matrices is a proper cone; it includes as a subset the collection of real positive-definite matrices.
Copositive matrices find applications in economics, operations research, and statistics.
