   Copositive matrix      Copositive matrix   In mathematics, specifically linear algebra , a real  matrix  A is copositive if        x  T   A  x   ≥  0         superscript  x  T   A  x   0    x^{T}Ax\geq 0   for every nonnegative vector    x  ≥  0      x  0    x\geq 0   . The collection of all copositive matrices is a proper cone; it includes as a subset the collection of real positive-definite matrices .  Copositive matrices find applications in economics, operations research , and statistics.
