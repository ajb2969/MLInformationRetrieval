   Sepiapterin deaminase      Sepiapterin deaminase   In enzymology , a sepiapterin deaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   sepiapterin + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   xanthopterin-B 2 + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sepiapterin and H 2 O , whereas its two products are xanthopterin-B2 and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sepiapterin aminohydrolase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.4  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
