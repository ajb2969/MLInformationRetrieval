Sepiapterin deaminase

In enzymology, a sepiapterin deaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

sepiapterin + H2O 
 
 
 
  xanthopterin-B2 + NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sepiapterin and H2O, whereas its two products are xanthopterin-B2 and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sepiapterin aminohydrolase.
