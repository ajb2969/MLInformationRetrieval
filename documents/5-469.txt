   Table of Lie groups      Table of Lie groups   This article gives a table of some common Lie groups and their associated Lie algebras .  The following are noted: the topological properties of the group ( dimension ; connectedness ; compactness ; the nature of the fundamental group ; and whether or not they are simply connected ) as well as on their algebraic properties ( abelian ; simple ; semisimple ).  For more examples of Lie groups and other related topics see the list of simple Lie groups ; the Bianchi classification of groups of up to three dimensions; and the list of Lie group topics .  Real Lie groups and their algebras  Column legend   CM : Is this group G  compact ? (Yes or No)      π  0     subscript  π  0    \pi_{0}    : Gives the group of components of G . The order of the component group gives the number of connected components . The group is connected if and only if the component group is trivial (denoted by 0).      π  1     subscript  π  1    \pi_{1}    : Gives the fundamental group of G whenever G is connected. The group is simply connected if and only if the fundamental group is trivial (denoted by 0).  UC : If G is not simply connected, gives the universal cover of G .
