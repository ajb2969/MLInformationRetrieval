Inverted Dirichlet distribution

In statistics, the inverted Dirichlet distribution is a multivariate generalization of the beta prime distribution, and is related to the Dirichlet distribution. It was first described by Tiao and Cuttman in 1965.1
The distribution has a density function given by



The distribution has applications in statistical regression and arises naturally when considering the multivariate Student distribution. It can be characterized2 by its moment generating function:



provided that 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The inverted Dirichlet distribution is conjugate to the negative multinomial distribution if a generalized form of odds ratio is used instead of the categories' probabilities.
