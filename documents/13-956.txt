   Poincaré series (modular form)      Poincaré series (modular form)   In number theory , a Poincaré series is a mathematical series generalizing the classical theta series that is associated to any discrete group of symmetries of a complex domain , possibly of several complex variables . In particular, they generalize classical Eisenstein series . They are named after Henri Poincaré .  If Γ is a finite group acting on a domain D and H ( z ) is any meromorphic function on D , then one obtains an automorphic function by averaging over Γ:        ∑   γ  ∈  Γ     H   (   γ   (  z  )    )     .      subscript     γ  normal-Γ      H    γ  z      \sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma}H(\gamma(z)).   However, if Γ is a discrete group , then additional factors must be introduced in order to assure convergence of such a series. To this end, a Poincaré series is a series of the form        θ  k    (  z  )    =    ∑   γ  ∈   Γ  *        (    J  γ    (  z  )    )   k   H   (   γ   (  z  )    )            subscript  θ  k   z     subscript     γ   superscript  normal-Γ         superscript     subscript  J  γ   z   k   H    γ  z       \theta_{k}(z)=\sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma^{*}}(J_{\gamma}(z))^{k}H(\gamma(z))   where J γ is the Jacobian determinant of the group element γ, 1 and the asterisk denotes that the summation takes place only over coset representatives yielding distinct terms in the series.  The classical Poincaré series of weight 2 k of a Fuchsian group Γ is defined by the series        θ  k    (  z  )    =    ∑   γ  ∈   Γ  *        (    c  z   +  d   )    -   2  k     H   (     a  z   +  b     c  z   +  d    )            subscript  θ  k   z     subscript     γ   superscript  normal-Γ         superscript      c  z   d       2  k     H        a  z   b       c  z   d        \theta_{k}(z)=\sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma^{*}}(cz+d)^{-2k}H\left(\frac{az+b}{cz+d}\right)   the summation extending over congruence classes of fractional linear transformations      γ  =   (     a     b  ;       c     d  ;      )       γ    a  b    c  d      \gamma=\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 c&d\end{pmatrix}   belonging to Γ. Choosing H to be a character of the cyclic group of order n , one obtains the so-called Poincaré series of order n :        θ   k  ,  n     (  z  )    =    ∑   γ  ∈   Γ  *        (    c  z   +  d   )    -   2  k      exp   (   2  π  i  n     a  z   +  b     c  z   +  d     )             subscript  θ   k  n    z     subscript     γ   superscript  normal-Γ         superscript      c  z   d       2  k         2  π  i  n        a  z   b       c  z   d          \theta_{k,n}(z)=\sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma^{*}}(cz+d)^{-2k}\exp\left(2\pi in\frac{%
 az+b}{cz+d}\right)   The latter Poincaré series converges absolutely and uniformly on compact sets (in the upper halfplane), and is a modular form of weight 2 k for Γ. Note that, when Γ is the full modular group and n = 0, one obtains the Eisenstein series of weight 2 k . In general, the Poincaré series is, for n ≥ 1, a cusp form .  Notes    References    .   .
