   Vanillate monooxygenase      Vanillate monooxygenase   In enzymology , a vanillate monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   + O 2 + NADH + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   + NAD + + H 2 O + formaldehyde   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are vanillate , O 2 , NADH , and H + , whereas its 4 products are 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate , NAD + , H 2 O , and formaldehyde .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is vanillate:oxygen oxidoreductase (demethylating) . Other names in common use include 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate demethylase , and vanillate demethylase . This enzyme participates in 2,4-dichlorobenzoate degradation .
