   6-hydroxyhexanoate dehydrogenase      6-hydroxyhexanoate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 6-hydroxyhexanoate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   6-hydroxyhexanoate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   6-oxohexanoate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 6-hydroxyhexanoate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 6-oxohexanoate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-hydroxyhexanoate:NAD + oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in caprolactam degradation .
