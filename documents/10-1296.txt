   Glycolaldehyde dehydrogenase      Glycolaldehyde dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a glycolaldehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   glycolaldehyde + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycolate + NADH + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are glycolaldehyde , NAD + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are glycolate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycolaldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called glycol aldehyde dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
