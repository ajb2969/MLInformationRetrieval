   Hitchin functional      Hitchin functional   The Hitchin functional is a mathematical concept with applications in string theory that was introduced by the British mathematician  Nigel Hitchin .  and  are the original articles of the Hitchin functional.  As with Hitchin's introduction of generalized complex manifolds , this is an example of a mathematical tool found useful in mathematical physics .  Formal definition  This is the definition for 6-manifolds. The definition in Hitchin's article is more general, but more abstract. 1  Let   M   M   M   be a compact , oriented 6- manifold with trivial canonical bundle . Then the Hitchin functional is a functional on 3-forms defined by the formula:      Φ   (  Ω  )   =   ∫  M   Ω  ∧  *  Ω  ,     fragments  Φ   fragments  normal-(  Ω  normal-)     subscript   M   Ω    Ω  normal-,    \Phi(\Omega)=\int_{M}\Omega\wedge*\Omega,     where   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is a 3-form and * denotes the Hodge star operator.  Properties   The Hitchin functional is analogous for six-manifold to the Yang-Mills functional for the four-manifolds.    The Hitchin functional is manifestly invariant under the action of the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms .    Theorem. Suppose that   M   M   M   is a three-dimensional complex manifold and   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is the real part of a non-vanishing holomorphic 3-form, then   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is a critical point of the functional   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   restricted to the cohomology class      [  Ω  ]   ∈    H  3    (  M  ,  R  )         delimited-[]  normal-Ω      superscript  H  3    M  R      [\Omega]\in H^{3}(M,R)   . Conversely, if   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is a critical point of the functional   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   in a given comohology class and    Ω  ∧  *  Ω  <  0     fragments  Ω    Ω   0    \Omega\wedge*\Omega<0   , then   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega    defines the structure of a complex manifold, such that   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is the real part of a non-vanishing holomorphic 3-form on   M   M   M   .    The proof of the theorem in Hitchin's articles  and  is relatively straightforward. The power of this concept is in the converse statement: if the exact form    Φ   (  Ω  )       normal-Φ  normal-Ω    \Phi(\Omega)   is known, we only have to look at its critical points to find the possible complex structures.   Stable forms  Action functionals often determine geometric structure 2 on   M   M   M   and geometric structure are often characterized by the existence of particular differential forms on   M   M   M   that obey some integrable conditions.  If an m -form   ω   ω   \omega   can be written with local coordinates      ω  =      d   p  1    ∧   d   q  1     +  ⋯  +   d   p  m     ∧   d   q  m         ω          d   subscript  p  1      d   subscript  q  1     normal-⋯    d   subscript  p  m       d   subscript  q  m       \omega=dp_{1}\wedge dq_{1}+\cdots+dp_{m}\wedge dq_{m}   and       d  ω   =  0        d  ω   0    d\omega=0   , then   ω   ω   \omega   defines symplectic structure .  A p -form    ω  ∈    Ω  p    (  M  ,  ℝ  )        ω     superscript  normal-Ω  p    M  ℝ      \omega\in\Omega^{p}(M,\mathbb{R})   is stable if it lies in an open orbit of the local    G  L   (  n  ,  ℝ  )       G  L   n  ℝ     GL(n,\mathbb{R})   action where n=dim(M), namely if any small perturbation    ω  ↦   ω  +   δ  ω       maps-to  ω    ω    δ  ω      \omega\mapsto\omega+\delta\omega   can be undone by a local    G  L   (  n  ,  ℝ  )       G  L   n  ℝ     GL(n,\mathbb{R})   action. So any 1 -form that don't vanish everywhere is stable; 2 -form (or p -form when p is even) stability is equivalent to nondegeneratacy.  What about p =3? For large n  3 -form is difficult because the dimension of     ∧  3    (   ℝ  n   )       superscript   3    superscript  ℝ  n     \wedge^{3}(\mathbb{R}^{n})   ,    n  3     superscript  n  3    n^{3}   , grows more firstly than the dimension of    G  L   (  n  ,  ℝ  )       G  L   n  ℝ     GL(n,\mathbb{R})   ,    n  2     superscript  n  2    n^{2}   . But there are some very lucky exceptional case, namely,    n  =  6      n  6    n=6   , when dim      ∧  3    (   ℝ  6   )    =  20        superscript   3    superscript  ℝ  6    20    \wedge^{3}(\mathbb{R}^{6})=20   , dim     G  L   (  6  ,  ℝ  )    =  36        G  L   6  ℝ    36    GL(6,\mathbb{R})=36   . Let   ρ   ρ   \rho   be a stable real 3 -form in dimension 6 . Then the stabilizer of   ρ   ρ   \rho   under    G  L   (  6  ,  ℝ  )       G  L   6  ℝ     GL(6,\mathbb{R})   has real dimension 36-20=16 , in fact either      S  L   (  3  ,  ℝ  )    ×  S   L   (  3  ,  ℝ  )           S  L   3  ℝ    S   L   3  ℝ     SL(3,\mathbb{R})\times SL(3,\mathbb{R})   or     S  L   (  3  ,  ℂ  )    ∩   S  L   (  3  ,  ℂ  )          S  L   3  ℂ      S  L   3  ℂ      SL(3,\mathbb{C})\cap SL(3,\mathbb{C})   .  Focus on the case of     S  L   (  3  ,  ℂ  )    ∩   S  L   (  3  ,  ℂ  )          S  L   3  ℂ      S  L   3  ℂ      SL(3,\mathbb{C})\cap SL(3,\mathbb{C})   and if   ρ   ρ   \rho   has a stabilizer in     S  L   (  3  ,  ℂ  )    ∩   S  L   (  3  ,  ℂ  )          S  L   3  ℂ      S  L   3  ℂ      SL(3,\mathbb{C})\cap SL(3,\mathbb{C})   then it can be written with local coordinates as follows:      ρ  =    1  2    (      ζ  1   ∧   ζ  2   ∧   ζ  3    +    ζ  1   ¯    ∧    ζ  2   ¯   ∧    ζ  3   ¯    )        ρ      1  2          subscript  ζ  1    subscript  ζ  2    subscript  ζ  3     normal-¯   subscript  ζ  1      normal-¯   subscript  ζ  2     normal-¯   subscript  ζ  3        \rho=\frac{1}{2}(\zeta_{1}\wedge\zeta_{2}\wedge\zeta_{3}+\bar{\zeta_{1}}\wedge%
 \bar{\zeta_{2}}\wedge\bar{\zeta_{3}})   where      ζ  1   =    e  1   +   i   e  2      ,     ζ  2   =    e  3   +   i   e  4      ,    ζ  3   =    e  5   +   i   e  6          formulae-sequence     subscript  ζ  1      subscript  e  1     i   subscript  e  2       formulae-sequence     subscript  ζ  2      subscript  e  3     i   subscript  e  4         subscript  ζ  3      subscript  e  5     i   subscript  e  6         \zeta_{1}=e_{1}+ie_{2},\zeta_{2}=e_{3}+ie_{4},\zeta_{3}=e_{5}+ie_{6}   and    e  i     subscript  e  i    e_{i}   are bases of     T  *   M       superscript  T    M    T^{*}M   . Then    ζ  i     subscript  ζ  i    \zeta_{i}   determines an almost complex structure on   M   M   M   . Moreover, if there exist local coordinate    (   z  1   ,   z  2   ,   z  3   )      subscript  z  1    subscript  z  2    subscript  z  3     (z_{1},z_{2},z_{3})   such that     ζ  i   =   d   z  i         subscript  ζ  i     d   subscript  z  i      \zeta_{i}=dz_{i}   then it determines fortunately an complex structure on   M   M   M   .  Given the stable    ρ  ∈    Ω  3    (  M  ,  ℝ  )        ρ     superscript  normal-Ω  3    M  ℝ      \rho\in\Omega^{3}(M,\mathbb{R})   :      ρ  =    1  2    (      ζ  1   ∧   ζ  2   ∧   ζ  3    +    ζ  1   ¯    ∧    ζ  2   ¯   ∧    ζ  3   ¯    )        ρ      1  2          subscript  ζ  1    subscript  ζ  2    subscript  ζ  3     normal-¯   subscript  ζ  1      normal-¯   subscript  ζ  2     normal-¯   subscript  ζ  3        \rho=\frac{1}{2}(\zeta_{1}\wedge\zeta_{2}\wedge\zeta_{3}+\bar{\zeta_{1}}\wedge%
 \bar{\zeta_{2}}\wedge\bar{\zeta_{3}})   . We can define another real 3 -from        ρ  ~    (  ρ  )    =    1  2    (      ζ  1   ∧   ζ  2   ∧   ζ  3    -    ζ  1   ¯    ∧    ζ  2   ¯   ∧    ζ  3   ¯    )           normal-~  ρ   ρ       1  2          subscript  ζ  1    subscript  ζ  2    subscript  ζ  3     normal-¯   subscript  ζ  1      normal-¯   subscript  ζ  2     normal-¯   subscript  ζ  3        \tilde{\rho}(\rho)=\frac{1}{2}(\zeta_{1}\wedge\zeta_{2}\wedge\zeta_{3}-\bar{%
 \zeta_{1}}\wedge\bar{\zeta_{2}}\wedge\bar{\zeta_{3}})   .  And then    Ω  =   ρ  +   i   ρ  ~    (  ρ  )         normal-Ω    ρ    i   normal-~  ρ   ρ      \Omega=\rho+i\tilde{\rho}(\rho)   is a holomorphic 3 -form in the almost complex structure determined by   ρ   ρ   \rho   . Furthermore, it becomes to be the complex structure just if     d  Ω   =  0        d  normal-Ω   0    d\Omega=0   i.e.     d  ρ   =  0        d  ρ   0    d\rho=0   and     d   ρ  ~    (  ρ  )    =  0        d   normal-~  ρ   ρ   0    d\tilde{\rho}(\rho)=0   . This   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is just the 3 -form   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   in formal definition of Hitchin functional . These idea induces the generalized complex structure .  Use in string theory  Hitchin functionals arise in many areas of string theory. An example is the compactifications of the 10-dimensional string with a subsequent orientifold projection   κ   κ   \kappa   using an involution    ν   ν   \nu   . In this case,   M   M   M   is the internal 6 (real) dimensional Calabi-Yau space . The couplings to the complexified Kähler coordinates    τ   τ   \tau   is given by        g   i  j    =   τ  im   ∫   τ   i  *    (    ν  ⋅  κ   τ   )       .       subscript  g    i  j      τ  im      τ   superscript  i       normal-⋅  ν  κ   τ        g_{ij}=\tau\text{im}\int\tau i^{*}(\nu\cdot\kappa\tau).     The potential function is the functional     V   [  J  ]    =    ∫  J   ∧  J  ∧  J         V   delimited-[]  J        J   J  J     V[J]=\int J\wedge J\wedge J   , where J is the almost complex structure . Both are Hitchin functionals.  As application to string theory, the famous OSV conjecture  used Hitchin functional in order to relate topological string to 4-dimensional black hole entropy. Using similar technique in the    G  2     subscript  G  2    G_{2}   holonomy  argued about topological M-theory and in the    S  p  i  n   (  7  )       S  p  i  n  7    Spin(7)   holonomy topological F-theory might be argued.  More recently, E. Witten claimed the mysterious superconformal field theory in six dimensions, called 6D (2,0) superconformal field theory . Hitchin functional gives one of the bases of it.
