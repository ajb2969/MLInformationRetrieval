Sabir Medgidovich Gusein-Zade (; born 29 July 1950, Moscow1) is a Russian mathematician and a specialist in singularity theory and its applications.2
He studied at Moscow State University, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1975 under the joint supervision of Sergei Novikov and Vladimir Arnold.3 Before entering the university, he had obtained a gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad.4
Gusein-Zade co-authored with V. I. Arnold and A. N. Varchenko the textbook Singularities of Differentiable Maps (published in English by Birkhäuser).5
A professor in both the Moscow State University and the Independent University of Moscow, Gusein-Zade also serves as co-editor-in-chief for the Moscow Mathematical Journal.6 He shares credit with Norbert A’Campo for results on the singularities of plane curves.789
