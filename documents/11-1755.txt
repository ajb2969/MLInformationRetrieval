Leonardo number

The Leonardo numbers are a sequence of numbers given by the recurrence:



Edsger W. Dijkstra1 used them as an integral part of his smoothsort algorithm,2 and also analyzed them in some detail.3
Computing a second-order recurrence relation recursively and without memoization requires L(n) computations for the n-th item of the series.
Relation to Fibonacci numbers
The Leonardo numbers are related to the Fibonacci numbers by the relation 
 
 
 
 .
From this relation it is straightforward to derive a closed-form expression for the Leonardo numbers, analogous to Binet's formula for the Fibonacci numbers:



where the golden ratio

 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the roots of the quadratic polynomial

 
 .
The first few Leonardo numbers are
