   UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 6-dehydrogenase      UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 6-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , an UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 6-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + 2 NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP-N-acetyl-2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucuronate + 2 NADH + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine , NAD + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are UDP-N-acetyl-2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucuronate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:NAD + 6-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoacetylglucosamine dehydrogenase , UDP-acetylglucosamine dehydrogenase , UDP-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose:NAD oxidoreductase , and UDP-GlcNAc dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
