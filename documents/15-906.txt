Pentalenolactone synthase




Pentalenolactone synthase

Pentalenolactone synthase (, penM (gene), pntM (gene)) is an enzyme with system name pentalenolactone-F:oxidized-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (pentalenolactone forming).1 This enzyme catalyse the following chemical reaction

pentalenolactone F + oxidized ferredoxin

pentalenolactone + reduced ferredoxin
 

This is heme-thiolate protein (P-450), which is isolated from the bacteria Streptomyces exfoliatus and Streptomyces arenae.
