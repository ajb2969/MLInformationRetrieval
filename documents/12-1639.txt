Ahlswede–Daykin inequality

A fundamental tool in statistical mechanics and probabilistic combinatorics (especially random graphs and the probabilistic method), the Ahlswede–Daykin inequality , also known as the four functions theorem (or inequality), is a correlation-type inequality for four functions on a finite distributive lattice.
It states that if 
 
 
 
  are nonnegative functions on a finite distributive lattice such that



for all x, y in the lattice, then



for all subsets X, Y of the lattice, where



and






The Ahlswede–Daykin inequality can be used to provide a short proof of both the Holley inequality and the FKG inequality. It also implies the Fishburn–Shepp inequality.
For a proof, see the original article  or .
Generalizations
The "four functions theorem" was independently generalized to 2k functions in  and .
