   Ahlswede–Daykin inequality      Ahlswede–Daykin inequality   A fundamental tool in statistical mechanics and probabilistic combinatorics (especially random graphs and the probabilistic method ), the Ahlswede–Daykin inequality , also known as the four functions theorem (or inequality ), is a correlation -type inequality for four functions on a finite distributive lattice .  It states that if     f  1   ,   f  2   ,   f  3   ,   f  4       subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2    subscript  f  3    subscript  f  4     f_{1},f_{2},f_{3},f_{4}   are nonnegative functions on a finite distributive lattice such that        f  1    (  x  )    f  2    (  y  )    ≤    f  3    (   x  ∨  y   )    f  4    (   x  ∧  y   )           subscript  f  1   x   subscript  f  2   y      subscript  f  3     x  y    subscript  f  4     x  y      f_{1}(x)f_{2}(y)\leq f_{3}(x\vee y)f_{4}(x\wedge y)     for all x , y in the lattice, then        f  1    (  X  )    f  2    (  Y  )    ≤    f  3    (   X  ∨  Y   )    f  4    (   X  ∧  Y   )           subscript  f  1   X   subscript  f  2   Y      subscript  f  3     X  Y    subscript  f  4     X  Y      f_{1}(X)f_{2}(Y)\leq f_{3}(X\vee Y)f_{4}(X\wedge Y)     for all subsets X , Y of the lattice, where       f   (  X  )    =    ∑   x  ∈  X     f   (  x  )           f  X     subscript     x  X      f  x      f(X)=\sum_{x\in X}f(x)     and       X  ∨  Y   =   {   x  ∨  y   ∣    x  ∈  X   ,   y  ∈  Y    }         X  Y    conditional-set    x  y    formulae-sequence    x  X     y  Y       X\vee Y=\{x\vee y\mid x\in X,y\in Y\}           X  ∧  Y   =   {   x  ∧  y   ∣    x  ∈  X   ,   y  ∈  Y    }    .        X  Y    conditional-set    x  y    formulae-sequence    x  X     y  Y       X\wedge Y=\{x\wedge y\mid x\in X,y\in Y\}.     The Ahlswede–Daykin inequality can be used to provide a short proof of both the Holley inequality and the FKG inequality . It also implies the Fishburn–Shepp inequality .
