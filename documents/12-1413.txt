   Papyrus 15      Papyrus 15   Papyrus 15 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), signed by   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    15 , is an early copy of the New Testament in Greek . It was originally a papyrus  manuscript of the Pauline Corpus of letters, but now only contains 1 Corinthians 7:18-8:4. 1 The manuscript has been palaeographically assigned to the 3rd century. 2  Description  The manuscript is written in a documentary hand. 3 There is about 37-38 lines per page. 4 Grenfeld and Hunt conjectured that   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    15 and    𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    16 might have been part of the same manuscript. Both manuscripts have the same formation of letters, line space, and punctuation. 5  The Greek text of this codex is probably a representative of the Alexandrian text-type , however the text is too brief to determine this exactly. Aland placed it in Category I . 6  It was the last papyrus classified by Gregory (in 1915).  Currently housed at the Egyptian Museum (JE 47423) in Cairo . 7 8  See also   List of New Testament papyri   References  Further reading   B. P. Grenfell & A. S.
