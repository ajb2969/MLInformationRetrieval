   Anthranilate N-methyltransferase      Anthranilate N-methyltransferase   In enzymology , an anthranilate N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + anthranilate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N-methylanthranilate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and anthranilate , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and N-methylanthranilate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:anthranilate N-methyltransferase . This enzyme is also called anthranilic acid N-methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in acridone alkaloid biosynthesis .  References     "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure  Category:Anthranilates
