   Mittag-Leffler summation      Mittag-Leffler summation   In mathematics, Mittag-Leffler summation is any of several variations of the Borel summation method for summing possibly divergent  formal power series , introduced by  Definition  Let       y   (  z  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     y  k    z  k           y  z     superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  y  k    superscript  z  k       y(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}y_{k}z^{k}     be a formal power series in z .  Define the transform     ℬ  α   y       subscript  ℬ  α   y    \scriptstyle\mathcal{B}_{\alpha}y   of   y   y   \scriptstyle y   by        ℬ  α   y   (  t  )    ≡    ∑   k  =  0   ∞      y  k    Γ   (   1  +   α  k    )      t  k            subscript  ℬ  α   y  t     superscript   subscript     k  0           subscript  y  k     normal-Γ    1    α  k       superscript  t  k       \mathcal{B}_{\alpha}y(t)\equiv\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{y_{k}}{\Gamma(1+\alpha k%
 )}t^{k}     Then the Mittag-Leffler sum of y is given by       lim   α  →  0      ℬ  α   y   (  z  )        subscript    normal-→  α  0       subscript  ℬ  α   y  z     \lim_{\alpha\rightarrow 0}\mathcal{B}_{\alpha}y(z)   if each sum converges and the limit exists.  A closely related summation method, also called Mittag-Leffler summation, is given as follows . Suppose that the Borel transform converges to an analytic function near 0 that can be analytically continued along the positive real axis to a function growing sufficiently slowly that the following integral is well defined (as an improper integral). Then the Mittag-Leffler sum of y is given by       ∫  0  ∞     e   -  t     ℬ  α   y   (    t  α   z   )   d  t       superscript   subscript   0        superscript  e    t     subscript  ℬ  α   y     superscript  t  α   z   d  t     \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-t}\mathcal{B}_{\alpha}y(t^{\alpha}z)\,dt     When α = 1 this is the same as Borel summation .
