Mittag-Leffler summation

In mathematics, Mittag-Leffler summation is any of several variations of the Borel summation method for summing possibly divergent formal power series, introduced by 
Definition
Let



be a formal power series in z.
Define the transform 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  by



Then the Mittag-Leffler sum of y is given by


 
  if each sum converges and the limit exists.
A closely related summation method, also called Mittag-Leffler summation, is given as follows . Suppose that the Borel transform converges to an analytic function near 0 that can be analytically continued along the positive real axis to a function growing sufficiently slowly that the following integral is well defined (as an improper integral). Then the Mittag-Leffler sum of y is given by



When α = 1 this is the same as Borel summation.
