   PreQ1 synthase      PreQ1 synthase   In enzymology , a preQ1 synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   7-aminomethyl-7-carbaguanine + 2 NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   7-cyano-7-carbaguanine + 2 NADPH + 2 H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 7-aminomethyl-7-carbaguanine and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 7-cyano-7-carbaguanine , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 7-aminomethyl-7-carbaguanine:NADP+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include YkvM , QueF , preQ0 reductase , preQ0 oxidoreductase , 7-cyano-7-deazaguanine reductase , 7-aminomethyl-7-carbaguanine:NADP+ oxidoreductase , queuine synthase (incorrect as queuine is not the product) , queuine:NADP+ oxidoreductase (incorrect as queuine is not the , and product) .
