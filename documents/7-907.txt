   Nonnegative matrix      Nonnegative matrix   In mathematics , a nonnegative matrix is a matrix in which all the elements are equal to or greater than zero       𝐗  ≥   0  ,   ∀  i   ,  j      x   i  j    ≥  0.      formulae-sequence    𝐗   0   for-all  i   j       subscript  x    i  j    0.     \mathbf{X}\geq 0,\qquad\forall{i,j}\quad x_{ij}\geq 0.   A positive matrix is a matrix in which all the elements are greater than zero. The set of positive matrices is a subset of all non-negative matrices. While such matrices are commonly found, the term is only occasionally used due to the possible confusion with positive-definite matrices , which are different.  A rectangular non-negative matrix can be approximated by a decomposition with two other non-negative matrices via non-negative matrix factorization .  A positive matrix is not the same as a positive-definite matrix . A matrix that is both non-negative and positive semidefinite is called a doubly non-negative matrix .  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of square positive matrices are described by the Perron–Frobenius theorem .  Inversion  The inverse of any non-singular  M-matrix is a non-negative matrix. If the non-singular M-matrix is also symmetric then it is called a Stieltjes matrix .  The inverse of a non-negative matrix is usually not non-negative. The exception is the non-negative monomial matrices : a non-negative matrix has non-negative inverse if and only if it is a (non-negative) monomial matrix. Note that thus the inverse of a positive matrix is not positive or even non-negative, as positive matrices are not monomial, for dimension    n  >  1.      n  1.    n>1.     Specializations  There are a number of groups of matrices that form specializations of non-negative matrices, e.g. stochastic matrix ; doubly stochastic matrix ; symmetric non-negative matrix.
