   Glossary of elementary quantum mechanics      Glossary of elementary quantum mechanics   This is a glossary for the terminology often encountered in undergraduate quantum mechanics courses.  Cautions:   Different authors may have different definitions for the same term.  The discussions are restricted to Schr√∂dinger picture and non- relativistic quantum mechanics .

Bra‚Äìket notation  The bra‚Äìket notation is a way to represent the states and operators of a system by angle brackets and vertical bars, for example,    |  Œ±  ‚ü©     ket  Œ±    |\alpha\rangle   and     |  Œ±  ‚ü©    ‚ü®  Œ≤  |        ket  Œ±    bra  Œ≤     |\alpha\rangle\langle\beta|   .

Normalized wavefunction  A wavefunction    |  a  ‚ü©     ket  a    |a\rangle   is said to be normalized if     ‚ü®  a  |  a  ‚ü©   =  1       inner-product  a  a   1    \langle a|a\rangle=1   .    Pure state  A state which can be represented as a wavefunction / ket in Hilbert space / solution of Schr√∂dinger equation is called pure state. See "mixed state".    Quantum numbers  a way of representing a state by several numbers, which corresponds to a complete set of commuting observables .  A common example of quantum numbers is the possible state of an electron in a central potential    (  n  ,  l  ,  m  ,  s  )     n  l  m  s    (n,l,m,s)   , which corresponds to the eigenstate of observables   H   H   H   (in terms of   r   r   r   ),   L   L   L   (magnitude of angular momentum),    L  z     subscript  L  z    L_{z}   (angular momentum in   z   z   z   -direction), and    S  z     subscript  S  z    S_{z}   .    Spin wavefunction   Part of a wavefunction of particle(s). See "total wavefunction of a particle".   Spinor   Synonymous to "spin wavefunction".   Spatial wavefunction   Part of a wavefunction of particle(s). See "total wavefunction of a particle".   State  A state is a complete description of the observable properties of a physical system.  Sometimes the word is used as a synonym of "wavefunction" or "pure state".    State vector  synonymous to "wavefunction".    Statistical ensemble  A large number of copies of a system.    System  A sufficiently isolated part in the universe for investigation.    Tensor product of Hilbert space  When we are considering the total system as a composite system of two subsystems A and B, the wavefunctions of the composite system are in a Hilbert space     H  A   ‚äó   H  B      tensor-product   subscript  H  A    subscript  H  B     H_{A}\otimes H_{B}   , if the Hilbert space of the wavefunctions for A and B are    H  A     subscript  H  A    H_{A}   and    H  B     subscript  H  B    H_{B}   respectively.    Total wavefunction of a particle  For single-particle system, the total wavefunction   Œ®   normal-Œ®   \Psi   of a particle can be expressed as a product of spatial wavefunction and the spinor. The total wavefunctions are in the tensor product space of the Hilbert space of the spatial part (which is spanned by the position eigenstates) and the Hilbert space for the spin.    Wavefunction  The word "wavefunction" could mean one of following:  A vector in Hilbert space which can represent a state; synonymous to "ket" or "state vector".  The state vector in a specific basis. It can be seen as a covariant vector in this case.  The state vector in position representation, e.g.      œà  Œ±    (   x  0   )    =   ‚ü®   x  0   |  Œ±  ‚ü©          subscript  œà  Œ±    subscript  x  0     inner-product   subscript  x  0   Œ±     \psi_{\alpha}(x_{0})=\langle x_{0}|\alpha\rangle   , where    |   x  0   ‚ü©     ket   subscript  x  0     |x_{0}\rangle   is the position eigenstate.     Dynamics   Degeneracy  See "degenerate energy level".    Degenerate energy level  If the energy of different state (wavefunctions which are not scalar multiple of each other) is the same, the energy level is called degenerate.  There is no degeneracy in 1D system.    Energy spectrum  The energy spectrum refers to the possible energy of a system.  For bound system (bound states), the energy spectrum is discrete; for unbound system (scattering states), the energy spectrum is continuous.  related mathematical topics: Sturm‚ÄìLiouville equation       Hamiltonian     H  ^     normal-^  H    \hat{H}     The operator represents the total energy of the system.

Collapse  "Collapse" means the sudden process which the state of the system will "suddenly" change to an eigenstate of the observable during measurement.  Eigenstates  An eigenstate of an operator   A   A   A   is a vector satisfied the eigenvalue equation     A   |  Œ±  ‚ü©    =   c   |  Œ±  ‚ü©          A   ket  Œ±      c   ket  Œ±      A|\alpha\rangle=c|\alpha\rangle   , where   c   c   c   is a scalar.

Hermitian operator  An operator satisfying $A = A^\dagger$ .  Equivalently, $\langle \alpha | A|\alpha \rangle = \langle \alpha | A^\dagger |\alpha \rangle$ for all allowable wavefunction $|\alpha\rangle$ .    Observable  Mathematically, it is represented by a Hermitian operator.    Quantum Zeno effect  The phenomenon that a frequent measurement leads to "freezing" of the state.   Indistinguishable particles   Exchange    Intrinsically identical particles  If the intrinsic properties (properties that can be measured but are independent of the quantum state, e.g. charge, total spin, mass) of two particles are the same, they are said to be (intrinsically) identical.    Indistinguishable particles  If a system shows measurable differences when one of its particles is replaced by another particle, these two particles are called distinguishable.    Bosons  Bosons are particles with integer spin ( s = 0, 1, 2, ... ). They can either be elementary (like photons ) or composite (such as mesons , nuclei or even atoms). There are five known elementary bosons: the four force carrying gauge bosons Œ≥ (photon), g ( gluon ), Z ( Z boson ) and W ( W boson ), as well as the Higgs boson .    Fermions  Fermions are particles with half-integer spin ( s = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, ... ). Like bosons, they can be elementary or composite particles. There are two types of elementary fermions: quarks and leptons , which are the main constituents of ordinary matter.
