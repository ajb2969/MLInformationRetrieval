   TRNA (guanine37-N1)-methyltransferase      TRNA (guanine37-N1)-methyltransferase   TRNA (guanine 37 -N 1 )-methyltransferase (, TrmD , tRNA (m1G37) methyltransferase , transfer RNA (m1G37) methyltransferase , Trm5p , TRMT5 , tRNA-(N1G37) methyltransferase , MJ0883 (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanine 37 -N 1 )-methyltransferase . 1 2 3 4 5 6 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine 37 in tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 1 -methylguanine 37 in tRNA   This enzyme is important for the maintenance of the correct reading frame during translation.
