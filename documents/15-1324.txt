TRNA (guanine37-N1)-methyltransferase

TRNA (guanine37-N1)-methyltransferase (, TrmD, tRNA (m1G37) methyltransferase, transfer RNA (m1G37) methyltransferase, Trm5p, TRMT5, tRNA-(N1G37) methyltransferase, MJ0883 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanine37-N1)-methyltransferase.123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine37 in tRNA 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N1-methylguanine37 in tRNA
 

This enzyme is important for the maintenance of the correct reading frame during translation.
