   Hamiltonian vector field      Hamiltonian vector field   In mathematics and physics , a Hamiltonian vector field on a symplectic manifold is a vector field , defined for any energy function or Hamiltonian . Named after the physicist and mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton , a Hamiltonian vector field is a geometric manifestation of Hamilton's equations in classical mechanics . The integral curves of a Hamiltonian vector field represent solutions to the equations of motion in the Hamiltonian form. The diffeomorphisms of a symplectic manifold arising from the flow of a Hamiltonian vector field are known as canonical transformations in physics and (Hamiltonian) symplectomorphisms in mathematics.  Hamiltonian vector fields can be defined more generally on an arbitrary Poisson manifold . The Lie bracket of two Hamiltonian vector fields corresponding to functions f and g on the manifold is itself a Hamiltonian vector field, with the Hamiltonian given by the Poisson bracket of f and g .  Definition  Suppose that ( M , ω ) is a symplectic manifold . Since the symplectic form  ω is nondegenerate, it sets up a fiberwise-linear  isomorphism       ω  :    T  M   →    T  *   M     ,     normal-:  ω   normal-→    T  M      superscript  T    M      \omega:TM\to T^{*}M,     between the tangent bundle  TM and the cotangent bundle  T*M , with the inverse       Ω  :      T  *   M   →   T  M    ,   Ω  =   ω   -  1       .     normal-:  normal-Ω   formulae-sequence   normal-→     superscript  T    M     T  M      normal-Ω   superscript  ω    1        \Omega:T^{*}M\to TM,\quad\Omega=\omega^{-1}.     Therefore, one-forms on a symplectic manifold M may be identified with vector fields and every differentiable function  H : M → R determines a unique vector field  X H , called the Hamiltonian vector field with the Hamiltonian  H , by requiring that for every vector field Y on M , the identity       d  H   (  Y  )    =   ω   (   X  H   ,  Y  )          normal-d  H  Y     ω    subscript  X  H   Y      \mathrm{d}H(Y)=\omega(X_{H},Y)\,     must hold.  Note : Some authors define the Hamiltonian vector field with the opposite sign. One has to be mindful of varying conventions in physical and mathematical literature.  Examples  Suppose that M is a 2 n -dimensional symplectic manifold. Then locally, one may choose canonical coordinates ( q 1 , ..., q n , p 1 , ..., p n ) on M , in which the symplectic form is expressed as       ω  =     ∑  i    d   q  i     ∧   d   p  i      ,      ω      subscript   i     normal-d   superscript  q  i       normal-d   subscript  p  i       \omega=\sum_{i}\mathrm{d}q^{i}\wedge\mathrm{d}p_{i},     where d denotes the exterior derivative and ∧ denotes the exterior product . Then the Hamiltonian vector field with Hamiltonian H takes the form         \Chi   H   =   (    ∂  H    ∂   p  i     ,   -    ∂  H    ∂   q  i      )   =    Ω   d  H    ,         subscript  \Chi  H        H      subscript  p  i           H      superscript  q  i              normal-Ω  normal-d  H      \Chi_{H}=\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial p_{i}},-\frac{\partial H}{\partial q%
 ^{i}}\right)=\Omega\,\mathrm{d}H,     where Ω is a 2 n by 2 n square matrix       Ω  =   [     0     I  n        -   I  n      0     ]    ,      normal-Ω    0   subscript  I  n        subscript  I  n    0      \Omega=\begin{bmatrix}0&I_{n}\\
 -I_{n}&0\\
 \end{bmatrix},   and        d  H   =   [        ∂  H    ∂   q  i             ∂  H    ∂   p  i         ]    .        normal-d  H         H      superscript  q  i           H      subscript  p  i         \mathrm{d}H=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial H}{\partial q^{i}}\\
 \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_{i}}\end{bmatrix}.   Suppose that M = R 2 n is the 2 n -dimensional symplectic vector space with (global) canonical coordinates.   If H = p i then      X  H   =   ∂  /   ∂   q  i      ;       subscript  X  H         superscript  q  i       X_{H}=\partial/\partial q^{i};     if H = q i then      X  H   =   -   ∂  /   ∂   p  i       ;       subscript  X  H           superscript  p  i        X_{H}=-\partial/\partial p^{i};     if    H  =    1  /  2    ∑    (   p  i   )   2         H      1  2      superscript   subscript  p  i   2       H=1/2\sum(p_{i})^{2}   then      X  H   =   ∑     p  i   ∂   /   ∂   q  i       ;       subscript  X  H          subscript  p  i        superscript  q  i        X_{H}=\sum p_{i}\partial/\partial q^{i};     if     H  =    1  /  2    ∑    a   i  j     q  i    q  j       ,    a   i  j    =   a   j  i        formulae-sequence    H      1  2        subscript  a    i  j     superscript  q  i    superscript  q  j          subscript  a    i  j     subscript  a    j  i       H=1/2\sum a_{ij}q^{i}q^{j},a_{ij}=a_{ji}   then      X  H   =   -   ∑     a   i  j     q  i   ∂   /   ∂   p  j        .       subscript  X  H            subscript  a    i  j     subscript  q  i        superscript  p  j         X_{H}=-\sum a_{ij}q_{i}\partial/\partial p^{j}.      Properties   The assignment f ↦ X f is linear , so that the sum of two Hamiltonian functions transforms into the sum of the corresponding Hamiltonian vector fields.    Suppose that ( q 1 , ..., q n , p 1 , ..., p n ) are canonical coordinates on M (see above). Then a curve γ( t )= (q(t),p(t)) is an integral curve of the Hamiltonian vector field X H if and only if it is a solution of the Hamilton's equations :         q  ˙   i   =    ∂  H    ∂   p  i          superscript   normal-˙  q   i       H      subscript  p  i       \dot{q}^{i}=\frac{\partial H}{\partial p_{i}}            p  ˙   i   =   -    ∂  H    ∂   q  i       .       subscript   normal-˙  p   i         H      superscript  q  i        \dot{p}_{i}=-\frac{\partial H}{\partial q^{i}}.      The Hamiltonian H is constant along the integral curves, because     ⟨   d  H   ,   γ  ˙   ⟩   =   ω   (    X  H    (  γ  )    ,    X  H    (  γ  )    )    =  0           d  H    normal-˙  γ      ω      subscript  X  H   γ      subscript  X  H   γ          0     \langle dH,\dot{\gamma}\rangle=\omega(X_{H}(\gamma),X_{H}(\gamma))=0   . That is, H (γ( t )) is actually independent of t . This property corresponds to the conservation of energy in Hamiltonian mechanics .    More generally, if two functions F and H have a zero Poisson bracket (cf. below), then F is constant along the integral curves of H , and similarly, H is constant along the integral curves of F . This fact is the abstract mathematical principle behind Noether's theorem .    The symplectic form ω is preserved by the Hamiltonian flow. Equivalently, the Lie derivative       ℒ   X  H    ω   =  0         subscript  ℒ   subscript  X  H    ω   0    \mathcal{L}_{X_{H}}\omega=0      Poisson bracket  The notion of a Hamiltonian vector field leads to a skew-symmetric bilinear operation on the differentiable functions on a symplectic manifold M , the Poisson bracket , defined by the formula       {  f  ,  g  }   =   ω   (   X  g   ,   X  f   )    =   d  g   (   X  f   )    =    ℒ   X  f    g          f  g     ω    subscript  X  g    subscript  X  f            d  g   subscript  X  f            subscript  ℒ   subscript  X  f    g      \{f,g\}=\omega(X_{g},X_{f})=dg(X_{f})=\mathcal{L}_{X_{f}}g     where    ℒ  X     subscript  ℒ  X    \mathcal{L}_{X}   denotes the Lie derivative along a vector field X . Moreover, one can check that the following identity holds:        X   {  f  ,  g  }    =   [   X  f   ,   X  g   ]    ,       subscript  X   f  g      subscript  X  f    subscript  X  g      X_{\{f,g\}}=[X_{f},X_{g}],     where the right hand side represents the Lie bracket of the Hamiltonian vector fields with Hamiltonians f and g . As a consequence (a proof at Poisson bracket ), the Poisson bracket satisfies the Jacobi identity         {   {  f  ,  g  }   ,  h  }   +   {   {  g  ,  h  }   ,  f  }   +   {   {  h  ,  f  }   ,  g  }    =  0   ,          f  g   h     g  h   f     h  f   g    0    \{\{f,g\},h\}+\{\{g,h\},f\}+\{\{h,f\},g\}=0,     which means that the vector space of differentiable functions on M , endowed with the Poisson bracket, has the structure of a Lie algebra over R , and the assignment f ↦ X f is a Lie algebra homomorphism , whose kernel consists of the locally constant functions (constant functions if M is connected).
