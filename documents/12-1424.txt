   Closed geodesic      Closed geodesic   In differential geometry and dynamical systems , a closed geodesic on a Riemannian manifold is the projection of a closed orbit of the geodesic flow on the manifold.  Definition  In a Riemannian manifold ( M , g ), a closed geodesic is a curve    γ  :   ℝ  →  M      normal-:  γ   normal-→  ℝ  M     \gamma:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow M   that is a geodesic for the metric g and is periodic.  Closed geodesics can be characterized by means of a variational principle. Denoting by    Λ  M      normal-Λ  M    \Lambda M   the space of smooth 1-periodic curves on M , closed geodesics of period 1 are precisely the critical points of the energy function    E  :    Λ  M   →  ℝ      normal-:  E   normal-→    normal-Λ  M   ℝ     E:\Lambda M\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   , defined by        E   (  γ  )    =    ∫  0  1     g   γ   (  t  )      (    γ  ˙    (  t  )    ,    γ  ˙    (  t  )    )   d  t     .

If   γ   γ   \gamma   is a closed geodesic of period p , the reparametrized curve    t  ↦   γ   (   p  t   )       maps-to  t    γ    p  t      t\mapsto\gamma(pt)   is a closed geodesic of period 1, and therefore it is a critical point of E . If   γ   γ   \gamma   is a critical point of E , so are the reparametrized curves    γ  m     superscript  γ  m    \gamma^{m}   , for each    m  ∈  ℕ      m  ℕ    m\in\mathbb{N}   , defined by      γ  m    (  t  )    :=   γ   (   m  t   )       assign     superscript  γ  m   t     γ    m  t      \gamma^{m}(t):=\gamma(mt)   . Thus every closed geodesic on M gives rise to an infinite sequence of critical points of the energy E .  Examples  On the unit sphere      S  n   ⊂   ℝ   n  +  1         superscript  S  n    superscript  ℝ    n  1      S^{n}\subset\mathbb{R}^{n+1}   with the standard round Riemannian metric, every great circle is an example of a closed geodesic. Manifolds all of whose geodesics are closed have been thoroughly investigated in the mathematical literature. On a compact hyperbolic surface , whose fundamental group has no torsion, closed geodesics are in one-to-one correspondence with non-trivial conjugacy classes of elements in the Fuchsian group of the surface.
