Closed geodesic

In differential geometry and dynamical systems, a closed geodesic on a Riemannian manifold is the projection of a closed orbit of the geodesic flow on the manifold.
Definition
In a Riemannian manifold (M,g), a closed geodesic is a curve 
 
 
 
  that is a geodesic for the metric g and is periodic.
Closed geodesics can be characterized by means of a variational principle. Denoting by 
 
 
 
  the space of smooth 1-periodic curves on M, closed geodesics of period 1 are precisely the critical points of the energy function 
 
 
 
 , defined by



If 
 
 
 
  is a closed geodesic of period p, the reparametrized curve 
 
 
 
  is a closed geodesic of period 1, and therefore it is a critical point of E. If 
 
 
 
  is a critical point of E, so are the reparametrized curves 
 
 
 
 , for each 
 
 
 
 
 , defined by 
 
 
 
 . Thus every closed geodesic on M gives rise to an infinite sequence of critical points of the energy E.
Examples
On the unit sphere

 
  with the standard round Riemannian metric, every great circle is an example of a closed geodesic. Manifolds all of whose geodesics are closed have been thoroughly investigated in the mathematical literature. On a compact hyperbolic surface, whose fundamental group has no torsion, closed geodesics are in one-to-one correspondence with non-trivial conjugacy classes of elements in the Fuchsian group of the surface.
