   Euler number (physics)      Euler number (physics)    The Euler number ( Eu ) is a dimensionless number used in fluid flow calculations. It expresses the relationship between a local pressure drop e.g. over a restriction and the kinetic energy per volume, and is used to characterize losses in the flow, where a perfect frictionless flow corresponds to an Euler number of 1. The inverse of the Euler number is referred to as the Ruark Number with the symbol Ru .  It is defined as      Eu  =     p  upstream   -   p  downstream     ρ   V  2         Eu       subscript  p  upstream    subscript  p  downstream      ρ   superscript  V  2       \mathrm{Eu}=\frac{p_{\mathrm{upstream}}-p_{\mathrm{downstream}}}{\rho V^{2}}     where      ρ   ρ   \rho   is the density of the fluid.      p  upstream     subscript  p  upstream    p_{\mathrm{upstream}}   is the upstream pressure.      p  downstream     subscript  p  downstream    p_{\mathrm{downstream}}   is the downstream pressure.     V   V   V   is a characteristic velocity of the flow.   The cavitation number has a similar structure, but a different meaning and use:  The Cavitation number ( Ca ) is a dimensionless number used in flow calculations. It expresses the relationship between the difference of a local absolute pressure from the vapor pressure and the kinetic energy per volume, and is used to characterize the potential of the flow to cavitate .  It is defined as      Ca  =    p  -   p  v      1  2   ρ   V  2         Ca      p   subscript  p  normal-v        1  2   ρ   superscript  V  2       \mathrm{Ca}=\frac{p-p_{\mathrm{v}}}{\frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}}     where      ρ   ρ   \rho   is the density of the fluid.     p   p   p   is the local pressure.      p  v     subscript  p  normal-v    p_{\mathrm{v}}   is the vapor pressure of the fluid.     V   V   V   is a characteristic velocity of the flow.
