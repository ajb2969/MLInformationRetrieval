Dihydrocarveol dehydrogenase

Dihydrocarveol dehydrogenase (, carveol dehydrogenase (ambiguous)) is an enzyme with system name menth-8-en-2-ol:NAD+ oxidoreductase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

menth-8-en-2-ol + NAD+

 
  menth-8-en-2-one + NADH + H+


This enzyme from the Gram-positive bacterium Rhodococcus erythropolis DCL14 forms part of the carveol and dihydrocarveol degradation pathway. The enzyme accepts all eight stereoisomers of menth-8-en-2-ol as substrate, although some isomers are converted faster than others. The preferred substrates are (+)-neoisodihydrocarveol, (+)-isodihydrocarveol, (+)-dihydrocarveol and (-)-isodihydrocarveol.
