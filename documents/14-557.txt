   Polyvector field      Polyvector field   In mathematics , a multivector field , polyvector field of '''degree k ''', or ''' k -vector field''', on a manifold  M , is a section of the k th exterior power of the tangent bundle ,     Λ  k   T  M       superscript  normal-Λ  k   T  M    \Lambda^{k}TM   . Polyvector fields of degree k are dual to k - forms .  See also   Multivector  Blade (geometry)   "  Category:Differential topology
