Antiprisms are a subclass of the prismatoids .  Antiprisms are similar to prisms except the bases are twisted relative to each other, and that the side faces are triangles, rather than quadrilaterals.  In the case of a regular n -sided base, one usually considers the case where its copy is twisted by an angle 180°/ n . Extra regularity is obtained by the line connecting the base centers being perpendicular to the base planes, making it a right antiprism . As faces, it has the two n -gonal bases and, connecting those bases, 2 n isosceles triangles.  Uniform antiprism  A uniform antiprism has, apart from the base faces, 2 n equilateral triangles as faces. As a class, the uniform antiprisms form an infinite series of vertex-uniform polyhedra, as do the uniform prisms. For  we have as degenerate case the regular tetrahedron as a digonal antiprism , and for  the non-degenerate regular octahedron as a triangular antiprism .  The dual polyhedra of the antiprisms are the trapezohedra . Their existence was first discussed and their name was coined by Johannes Kepler .

Volume and surface area  Let a be the edge-length of a uniform antiprism. Then the volume is      V  =      n     4    cos  2    π   2  n      -  1     sin    3  π    2  n       12    sin  2    π  n        a  3        V        n        4    superscript   2     π    2  n      1          3  π     2  n        12    superscript   2     π  n       superscript  a  3      V=\frac{n\sqrt{4\cos^{2}\frac{\pi}{2n}-1}\sin\frac{3\pi}{2n}}{12\sin^{2}\frac{%

A      n  2         π  n      3     superscript  a  2      A=\frac{n}{2}(\cot{\frac{\pi}{n}}+\sqrt{3})a^{2}.     Related polyhedra  There are an infinite set of truncated antiprisms, including a lower-symmetry form of the truncated octahedron (truncated triangular antiprism). These can be alternated to create snub antiprisms , two of which are Johnson solids , and the snub triangular antiprism is a lower symmetry form of the icosahedron .

The symmetry group contains inversion  if and only if  n is odd.  The rotation group is D n of order 2 n , except in the case of a tetrahedron, which has the larger rotation group T of order 12, which has three versions of D 2 as subgroups, and the octahedron, which has the larger rotation group O of order 24, which has four versions of D 3 as subgroups.  Star antiprism      5/2-antiprism   5/3-antiprism     9/2-antiprism   9/4-antiprism     Uniform star antiprisms are named by their star polygon bases, {p/q}, and exist in prograde and retrograde (crossed) solutions. Crossed forms have intersecting vertex figures , and are denoted by inverted fractions, p/(p-q) instead of p/q, like 5/3 versus 5/2.  In the retrograde forms but not in the prograde forms, the triangles joining the star bases intersect the axis of rotational symmetry.  Some retrograde star antiprisms with regular star polygon bases cannot be constructed with equal edge lengths, so are not uniform polyhedra. Star antiprism compounds also can be constructed where p and q have common factors; thus a 10/4 antiprism is the compound of two 5/2 star antiprisms.
