   Dual q-Hahn polynomials      Dual q-Hahn polynomials   In mathematics, the dual q -Hahn polynomials are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme .  give a detailed list of their properties.  Definition  The polynomials are given in terms of basic hypergeometric functions and the Pochhammer symbol by  $$\displaystyle$$  Orthogonality  Recurrence and difference relations  Rodrigues formula  Generating function  Relation to other polynomials  Gallery     (Figure)  DUAL QHAHN ABS COMPLEX3D MAPLE PLOT   (Figure)  DUAL QHAHN IM COMPLEX3D MAPLE PLOT   (Figure)  DUAL QHAHN RE COMPLEX3D MAPLE PLOT         (Figure)  DUAL QHAHN ABS DENSITY MAPLE PLOT   (Figure)  DUAL QHAHN IM DENSITY MAPLE PLOT   (Figure)  DUAL QHAHN RE DENSITY MAPLE PLOT      References       "  Category:Orthogonal polynomials  Category:Q-analogs  Category:Special hypergeometric functions
