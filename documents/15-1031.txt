Linoleate 10R-lipoxygenase

Linoleate 10R-lipoxygenase (, 10R-DOX, (10R)-dioxygenase, 10R-dioxygenase) is an enzyme with system name linoleate:oxygen (10R)-oxidoreductase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

linoleate + O2

 
  (8E,10R,12Z)-10-hydroperoxy-8,12-octadecadienoate
 

Linoleate 10R-lipoxygenase is involved in biosynthesis of oxylipins.
