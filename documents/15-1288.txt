23S rRNA (uridine2479-2'-O)-methyltransferase

23S rRNA (uridine2479-2'-O)-methyltransferase (, AviRb) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (uridine2479-2'-O)-methyltransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + uridine2479 in 23S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methyluridine2479 in 23S rRNA
 

Streptomyces viridochromogenes produces the antibiotic avilamycin A which binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit to inhibit protein synthesis.
