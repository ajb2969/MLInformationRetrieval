List of logic symbols

{{ SpecialChars | special = logic symbols | fix = Help:Special_characters | characters = logic symbols }}
In logic, a set of symbols is commonly used to express logical representation. As logicians are familiar with these symbols, they are not explained each time they are used. So, for students of logic, the following table lists many common symbols together with their name, pronunciation, and the related field of mathematics. Additionally, the third column contains an informal definition, and the fourth column gives a short example.
Be aware that, outside of logic, different symbols have the same meaning, and the same symbol has, depending on the context, different meanings.

⇒

 ⊃


|material implication

A ⇒ B is true only in the case that either A is false or B is true.

 → may mean the same as ⇒ (the symbol may also indicate the domain and codomain of a function; see table of mathematical symbols).

 ⊃ may mean the same as ⇒ (the symbol may also mean superset).

x = 2  ⇒  x2 = 4 is true, but x2 = 4   ⇒  x = 2 is in general false (since x could be −2).

|logical (inclusive) disjunction

Advanced and rarely used logical symbols
These symbols are sorted by their Unicode value:


, an outdated way for denoting AND,2 still in use in electronics; for example "A·B" is the same as "A&B;"
·: Center dot with a line above it. Outdated way for denoting NAND, for example "A·B" is the same as "A NAND B" or "A|B" or "¬(A & B)". See also Unicode .



, used as abbreviation for standard numerals (Typographical Number Theory). For example, using HTML style "" is a shorthand for the standard numeral "SSSS0".
Overline, is also a rarely used format for denoting Gödel numbers, for example "AVB" says the Gödel number of "(AVB)"
Overline is also an outdated way for denoting negation, still in use in electronics; for example "AVB" is the same as "¬(AVB)"



or : Sheffer stroke, the sign for the NAND operator.



strike out existential quantifier same as "¬∃"
 





is a model of
 



is true of
 



negated ⊢, the sign for "does not prove", for example T ⊬ P says "P is not a theorem of T"
 



is not true of
 



another NAND operator, can also be rendered as ∧




another NOR operator, can also be rendered as V




modal operator for "it is possible that", "it is not necessarily not" or rarely "it is not provable not" (in most modal logics it is defined as "¬◻¬")
 



usually used for ad-hoc operators
 


or : Webb-operator or Peirce arrow, the sign for NOR. Confusingly, "⊥" is also the sign for contradiction or absurdity.






and : corner quotes, also called "Quine quotes"; for quasi-quotation, i.e. quoting specific context of unspecified ("variable") expressions;3 also used for denoting Gödel number;4 for example "⌜G⌝" denotes the Gödel number of G. (Typographical note: although the quotes appears as a "pair" in unicode (231C and 231D), they are not symmetrical in some fonts. And in some fonts (for example Arial) they are only symmetrical in certain sizes. Alternatively the quotes can be rendered as ⌈ and ⌉ (U+2308 and U+2309) or by using a negation symbol and a reversed negation symbol ⌐ ¬ in superscript mode. )



or : modal operator for "it is necessary that" (in modal logic), or "it is provable that" (in provability logic), or "it is obligatory that" (in deontic logic), or "it is believed that" (in doxastic logic).

Note that the following operators are rarely supported by natively installed fonts. If you wish to use these in a web page, you should always embed the necessary fonts so the page viewer can see the web page without having the necessary fonts installed in their computer.




modal operator for was never
 



modal operator for will never be
 



modal operator for was always
 



modal operator for will always be
 



sometimes used for "relation", also used for denoting various ad hoc relations (for example, for denoting "witnessing" in the context of Rosser's trick) The fish hook is also used as strict implication by C.I.Lewis 
 
 

 
 , the corresponding LaTeX macro is \strictif. See here for an image of glyph. Added to Unicode 3.2.0.
 


Poland and Germany
in Poland, the universal quantifier is sometimes written 
 
 
 
  and the existential quantifier as 
 
 
 
 . The same applies for Germany.
