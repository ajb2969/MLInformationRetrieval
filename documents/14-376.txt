}} The RD-120 is a LOX/Kerosene upper stage engine that is used in the Zenit family of launch vehicles. It is a single combustion chamber engine with oxygen-rich staged combustion. The engine has been developed from 1976 to 1985 and has achieved a high degree of reliability.
Between 2001 and 2003 a modernized 'Uprated' or 'Forced' version of the engine has also been developed with many improvements, which allowed the increase of chamber pressure and thrust without additional weight gain.
It should not be confused with the RD-0120, which is a discontinued LOX/hydrogen rocket engine that was used in the Soviet Energia launch system.2
