   Osmotic coefficient      Osmotic coefficient   An osmotic coefficient  φ is a quantity which characterises the deviation of a solvent from ideal behaviour , referenced to Raoult's law . The osmotic coefficient based on molality  b is defined by:      φ  =      μ  A  *   -   μ  A     R  T   M  A     ∑  i    b  i           φ       superscript   subscript  μ  A      subscript  μ  A      R  T   subscript  M  A     subscript   i    subscript  b  i        \varphi=\frac{\mu_{A}^{*}-\mu_{A}}{RTM_{A}\sum_{i}b_{i}}\,     and on an amount fraction basis by:      φ  =   -      μ  A  *   -   μ  A     R  T   ln   x  A            φ         superscript   subscript  μ  A      subscript  μ  A      R  T     subscript  x  A         \varphi=-\frac{\mu_{A}^{*}-\mu_{A}}{RT\ln x_{A}}\,     where    μ  A  *     superscript   subscript  μ  A      \mu_{A}^{*}   is the chemical potential of the pure solvent and    μ  A     subscript  μ  A    \mu_{A}   is the chemical potential of the solvent in a solution, M A is its molar mass , x A its amount fraction , R the gas constant and T the temperature in kelvins . 1 The latter osmotic coefficient is sometimes called the rational osmotic coefficient . The values for the two definitions are different, but since        ln   x  A    =   -   ln   (   1  +    M  A     ∑  i    b  i      )     ≈   -    M  A     ∑  i    b  i       ,           subscript  x  A          1     subscript  M  A     subscript   i    subscript  b  i                  subscript  M  A     subscript   i    subscript  b  i         \ln x_{A}=-\ln(1+M_{A}\sum_{i}b_{i})\approx-M_{A}\sum_{i}b_{i},     the two definitions are similar, and in fact both approach 1 as the concentration goes to zero.  In a single solute solution, the (molality based) osmotic coefficient and the solute activity coefficient are related to the excess Gibbs free energy     G   e  x      subscript  G    e  x     G_{ex}   by the relations:       R  T  b   (   1  -  φ   )    =    G   e  x    -   b    d   G   e  x      d  b            R  T  b    1  φ       subscript  G    e  x      b      d   subscript  G    e  x       d  b        RTb(1-\varphi)=G_{ex}-b\frac{dG_{ex}}{db}          R  T   ln  γ    =    d   G   e  x      d  b          R  T    γ        d   subscript  G    e  x       d  b      RT\ln\gamma=\frac{dG_{ex}}{db}     and there is thus a differential relationship between them (temperature and pressure held constant):       d   (    (   φ  -  1   )   b   )    =   b  d   ln  γ          d      φ  1   b      b  d    γ      d((\varphi-1)b)=bd\ln\gamma     In ionic solutions , Debye-Hückel theory implies that     (   φ  -  1   )     ∑  i    b  i          φ  1     subscript   i    subscript  b  i      (\varphi-1)\sum_{i}b_{i}   is asymptotic to    -    2  3   A   I   3  /  2             2  3   A   superscript  I    3  2       -\frac{2}{3}AI^{3/2}   , where I is ionic strength and A is the Debye-Hückel constant (equal to about 1.17 for water at 25 °C). This means that, at least at low concentrations, the vapor pressure of the solvent will be greater than that predicted by Raoult's law. For instance, for solutions of magnesium chloride , the vapor pressure is slightly greater than that predicted by Raoult's law up to a concentration of 0.7 mol/kg, after which the vapor pressure is lower than Raoult's law predicts.  For aqueous solutions, the osmotic coefficients can be calculated theoretically by Pitzer equations 2 or TCPC model. 3 4 5 6  See also   Bromley equation  Pitzer equation  Davies equation  van 't Hoff factor  Thermodynamic activity   References  "  Category:Physical chemistry     ↩  I.
