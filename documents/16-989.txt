Mandel Q parameter

The Mandel Q parameter measures the departure of the occupation number distribution from Poissonian statistics. It was introduced in quantum optics by L. Mandel.1 It is a convenient way to characterize non-classical states with negative values indicating a sub-Poissonian statistics, which have no classical analog. It is defined as the normalized variance of the boson distribution:



where 
 
 
 
  is the photon number operator and 
 
 
 
  is the normalized second-order correlation function as defined by Glauber.2
Non-classical value
Negative values of Q corresponds to state which variance of photon number is less than the mean (equivalent to sub-Poissonian statistics). In this case, the phase space distribution cannot be interpreted as a classical probability distribution.



The minimal value 
 
 
 
  is obtained for photon number states, which by definition have a well-defined number of photon and for which 
 
 
 
 .
Examples
For black-body radiation, the phase-space functional is Gaussian. The resulting occupation distribution of the number state is characterized by a Boseâ€“Einstein statistics for which

Coherent states have a Poissonian photon-number statistics for which
