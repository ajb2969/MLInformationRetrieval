   Definable set      Definable set   In mathematical logic , a definable set is an n -ary relation on the domain of a structure whose elements are precisely those elements satisfying some formula in the language of that structure. A set can be defined with or without parameters , which are elements of the domain that can be referenced in the formula defining the relation.  Definition  Let   ‚Ñí   ‚Ñí   \mathcal{L}   be a first-order language,   ‚Ñ≥   ‚Ñ≥   \mathcal{M}   an   ‚Ñí   ‚Ñí   \mathcal{L}   -structure with domain   M   M   M   ,   X   X   X   a fixed subset of   M   M   M   , and   m   m   m   a natural number. Then:   A set    A  ‚äÜ   M  m       A   superscript  M  m     A\subseteq M^{m}   is definable in   ‚Ñ≥   ‚Ñ≥   \mathcal{M}   with parameters from   X   X   X    if and only if there exists a formula    œÜ   [   x  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  m   ,   y  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   y  n   ]       œÜ    subscript  x  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  m    subscript  y  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  y  n      \varphi[x_{1},\ldots,x_{m},y_{1},\ldots,y_{n}]   and elements      b  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   b  n    ‚àà  X        subscript  b  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  b  n    X    b_{1},\ldots,b_{n}\in X   such that for all      a  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   a  m    ‚àà  M        subscript  a  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  a  m    M    a_{1},\ldots,a_{m}\in M   ,        (   a  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   a  m   )   ‚àà  A        subscript  a  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  a  m    A    (a_{1},\ldots,a_{m})\in A   if and only if    ‚Ñ≥  ‚äß   œÜ   [   a  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   a  m   ,   b  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   b  n   ]       models  ‚Ñ≥    œÜ    subscript  a  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  a  m    subscript  b  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  b  n       \mathcal{M}\models\varphi[a_{1},\ldots,a_{m},b_{1},\ldots,b_{n}]      The bracket notation here indicates the semantic evaluation of the free variables in the formula.    A set    A   A   A   is definable in   ‚Ñ≥   ‚Ñ≥   \mathcal{M}   without parameters if it is definable in   ‚Ñ≥   ‚Ñ≥   \mathcal{M}   with parameters from the empty set (that is, with no parameters in the defining formula).  A function is definable in   ‚Ñ≥   ‚Ñ≥   \mathcal{M}   (with parameters) if its graph is definable (with those parameters) in   ‚Ñ≥   ‚Ñ≥   \mathcal{M}   .  An element   a   a   a   is definable in   ‚Ñ≥   ‚Ñ≥   \mathcal{M}   (with parameters) if the singleton set    {  a  }     a    \{a\}   is definable in   ‚Ñ≥   ‚Ñ≥   \mathcal{M}   (with those parameters).   Examples  The natural numbers with only the order relation  Let    ùí©  =   (  ‚Ñï  ,  <  )       ùí©   ‚Ñï      \mathcal{N}=(\mathbb{N},<)   be the structure consisting of the natural numbers with the usual ordering. Then every natural number is definable in   ùí©   ùí©   \mathcal{N}   without parameters. The number   0   0    is defined by the formula    œÜ   (  x  )       œÜ  x    \varphi(x)   stating that there exist no elements less than x :      œÜ   (  x  )       œÜ  x    \varphi(x)   is defined by the formula   n   n   n   stating there exist exactly    ùí©  =   (  ‚Ñï  ,  +  ,  ‚ãÖ  ,  <  )       ùí©   ‚Ñï   normal-‚ãÖ      \mathcal{N}=(\mathbb{N},+,\cdot,<)   elements less than x :      ‚Ñõ  =   (  ‚Ñù  ,  0  ,  1  ,  +  ,  ‚ãÖ  )       ‚Ñõ   ‚Ñù  0  1   normal-‚ãÖ     \mathcal{R}=(\mathbb{R},0,1,+,\cdot)   consisting of the integers with the usual ordering (see the section on automorphisms below).  The natural numbers with their arithmetical operations  Let    œÜ  =  ‚àÉ  y   (  y  ‚ãÖ  y  ‚â°  x  )   .     fragments  œÜ    y   fragments  normal-(  y  normal-‚ãÖ  y   x  normal-)   normal-.    \varphi=\exists y(y\cdot y\equiv x).   be the first-order structure consisting of the natural numbers and their usual arithmetic operations and order relation. The sets definable in this structure are known as the arithmetical sets , and are classified in the arithmetical hierarchy . If the structure is considered in second-order logic instead of first-order logic, the definable sets of natural numbers in the resulting structure are classified in the analytical hierarchy . These hierarchies reveal many relationships between definability in this structure and computability theory , and are also of interest in descriptive set theory .  The field of real numbers  Let    a  ‚àà   \R       a  \R    a\in\R   be the structure consisting of the field of real numbers . Although the usual ordering relation is not directly included in the structure, there is a formula that defines the set of nonnegative reals, since these are the only reals that possess square roots:      ‚Ñõ  ‚äß   œÜ   [  a  ]       models  ‚Ñõ    œÜ   delimited-[]  a      \mathcal{R}\models\varphi[a]     Thus any   ‚Ñõ   ‚Ñõ   \mathcal{R}   is nonnegative if and only if   œÜ   œÜ   \varphi   . In conjunction with a formula that defines the additive inverse of a real number in   ‚Ñõ   ‚Ñõ   \mathcal{R}   , one can use     a  ,  b   ‚àà   \R        a  b   \R    a,b\in\R   to define the usual ordering in    a  ‚â§  b      a  b    a\leq b   : for    b  -  a      b  a    b-a   , set     ‚Ñõ  ‚â§   =   (  ‚Ñù  ,  0  ,  1  ,  +  ,  ‚ãÖ  ,  ‚â§  )        superscript  ‚Ñõ     ‚Ñù  0  1   normal-‚ãÖ      \mathcal{R}^{\leq}=(\mathbb{R},0,1,+,\cdot,\leq)   if and only if    ‚Ñõ  ‚â§     superscript  ‚Ñõ     \mathcal{R}^{\leq}   is nonnegative. The enlarged structure   ‚Ñ≥   ‚Ñ≥   \mathcal{M}   s is called a definitional extension of the original structure. It has the same expressive power as the original structure, in the sense that a set is definable over the enlarged structure from a set of parameters if and only if it is definable over the original structure from that same set of parameters.  The theory of   ‚Ñí   ‚Ñí   \mathcal{L}   has quantifier elimination . Thus the definable sets are Boolean combinations of solutions to polynomial equalities and inequalities; these are called semi-algebraic sets . Generalizing this property of the real line leads to the study of o-minimality .  Invariance under automorphisms  An important result about definable sets is that they are preserved under automorphisms .   Let   M   M   M   be an    X  ‚äÜ  M      X  M    X\subseteq M   -structure with domain    A  ‚äÜ   M  m       A   superscript  M  m     A\subseteq M^{m}   ,   ‚Ñ≥   ‚Ñ≥   \mathcal{M}   , and   X   X   X   definable in    œÄ  :   M  ‚Üí  M      normal-:  œÄ   normal-‚Üí  M  M     \pi:M\to M   with parameters from   ‚Ñ≥   ‚Ñ≥   \mathcal{M}   . Let   X   X   X   be an automorphism of      a  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   a  m    ‚àà  M        subscript  a  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  a  m    M    a_{1},\ldots,a_{m}\in M   which is the identity on     (   a  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   a  m   )   ‚àà  A        subscript  a  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  a  m    A    (a_{1},\ldots,a_{m})\in A   . Then for all     (   œÄ   (   a  1   )    ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   œÄ   (   a  m   )    )   ‚àà  A         œÄ   subscript  a  1    normal-‚Ä¶    œÄ   subscript  a  m     A    (\pi(a_{1}),\ldots,\pi(a_{m}))\in A   ,         ùíµ  =   (  ‚Ñ§  ,  <  )       ùíµ   ‚Ñ§      \mathcal{Z}=(\mathbb{Z},<)   if and only if   ùíµ   ùíµ   \mathcal{Z}        This result can sometimes be used to classify the definable subsets of a given structure. For example, in the case of   ùíµ   ùíµ   \mathcal{Z}   above, any translation of   ùíµ   ùíµ   \mathcal{Z}   is an automorphism preserving the empty set of parameters, and thus it is impossible to define any particular integer in this structure without parameters in   ‚Ñ§   ‚Ñ§   \mathbb{Z}   . In fact, since any two integers are carried to each other by a translation and its inverse, the only sets of integers definable in   ùíµ   ùíµ   \mathcal{Z}   without parameters are the empty set and $\mathbb{Z}$ itself. In contrast, there are infinitely many definable sets of pairs (or indeed n -tuples for any fixed n >1) of elements of $\mathcal{Z}$ , since any automorphism (translation) preserves the "distance" between two elements.
