   Color–flavor locking      Color–flavor locking   Color–flavor locking (CFL) is a phenomenon that is expected to occur in ultra-high-density strange matter , a form of quark matter . The quarks form Cooper pairs , whose color properties are correlated with their flavor properties in a one-to-one correspondence between three color pairs and three flavor pairs. According to the Standard Model of particle physics, the color-flavor-locked phase is the highest-density phase of three-flavor matter. 1  Color-flavor-locked Cooper pairing  If each quark is represented as    ψ  i  α     subscript   superscript  ψ  α   i    \psi^{\alpha}_{i}   , with color index   α   α   \alpha   taking values 1, 2, 3 corresponding to red, green, and blue, and flavor index   i   i   i   taking values 1, 2, 3 corresponding to up , down , and strange , then the color-flavor-locked pattern of Cooper pairing is 2       ⟨    ψ  i  α   C   γ  5    ψ  j  β    ⟩   ∝     δ  i  α    δ  j  β    -    δ  j  α    δ  i  β     =    ϵ   α  β  A     ϵ   i  j  A          proportional-to   delimited-⟨⟩     subscript   superscript  ψ  α   i   C   subscript  γ  5    subscript   superscript  ψ  β   j          subscript   superscript  δ  α   i    subscript   superscript  δ  β   j       subscript   superscript  δ  α   j    subscript   superscript  δ  β   i             superscript  ϵ    α  β  A     subscript  ϵ    i  j  A        \langle\psi^{\alpha}_{i}C\gamma_{5}\psi^{\beta}_{j}\rangle\propto\delta^{%

 \alpha\beta A}\epsilon_{ijA}     This means that a Cooper pair of an up quark and a down quark must have colors red and green, and so on. This pairing pattern is special because it leaves a large unbroken symmetry group.  Physical properties  The CFL phase has several remarkable properties.   It breaks chiral symmetry .  It is a superfluid .  It is an electromagnetic insulator , in which there is a "rotated" photon , containing a small admixture of one of the gluons .  It has the same symmetries as sufficiently dense hyperonic matter.   There are several variants of the CFL phase, representing distortions of the pairing structure in response to external stresses such as a difference between the mass of the strange quark and the mass of the up and down quarks.
