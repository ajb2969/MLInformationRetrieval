   Rodrigues' rotation formula      Rodrigues' rotation formula    This article is about the Rodrigues' rotation formula, which is distinct from the related Euler–Rodrigues parameters and The Euler–Rodrigues formula for 3D rotation .    In the theory of three-dimensional rotation , Rodrigues' rotation formula , named after Olinde Rodrigues , is an efficient algorithm for rotating a vector in space, given an axis and angle of rotation . By extension, this can be used to transform all three basis vectors to compute a rotation matrix in     S  O   (  3  )       S  O  3    SO(3)    , the group of all rotation matrices, from an axis–angle representation . In other words, the Rodrigues' formula provides an algorithm to compute the exponential map from    𝐬𝐨   (  3  )       𝐬𝐨  3    \mathbf{so}(3)   , the Lie algebra of    S  O   (  3  )       S  O  3    SO(3)   , to    S  O   (  3  )       S  O  3    SO(3)   without actually computing the full matrix exponential.  Statement  If   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   is a vector in and   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   is a unit vector describing an axis of rotation about which   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   rotates by an angle   θ   θ   θ   according to the right hand rule , the Rodrigues formula is  Derivation  (Figure)  Rodrigues' rotation formula rotates   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   by an angle   θ   θ   θ   around vector   k   k   k   by decomposing it into its components parallel and perpendicular to   k   k   k   , and rotating only the perpendicular component.   Given a rotation axis represented by a unit vector   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   and a vector   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   to rotate about   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   by the angle   θ   θ   θ   ,       𝐯  ∥   =    (   𝐤  ⋅  𝐯   )   𝐤        subscript  𝐯  parallel-to      normal-⋅  𝐤  𝐯   𝐤     \mathbf{v}_{\parallel}=(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v})\mathbf{k}   is the component of   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   parallel to   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   , also called the vector projection of   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   on   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   , and       𝐯  ⟂   =   𝐯  -   𝐯  ∥    =   𝐯  -    (   𝐤  ⋅  𝐯   )   𝐤           subscript  𝐯  perpendicular-to     𝐯   subscript  𝐯  parallel-to           𝐯     normal-⋅  𝐤  𝐯   𝐤       \mathbf{v}_{\perp}=\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v}_{\parallel}=\mathbf{v}-(\mathbf{k}%
 \cdot\mathbf{v})\mathbf{k}   is the component of   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   orthogonal to   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   , also called the vector rejection of   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   from   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   .  Define       𝐰  =   𝐤  ×  𝐯    .      𝐰    𝐤  𝐯     \mathbf{w}=\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{v}.     The vectors and   𝐰   𝐰   \mathbf{w}   have the same length, but   𝐰   𝐰   \mathbf{w}   is perpendicular to both   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   and . This follows from       𝐰  =   𝐤  ×  𝐯   =   𝐤  ×   (    𝐯  ∥   +   𝐯  ⟂    )    =    𝐤  ×   𝐯  ∥    +   𝐤  ×   𝐯  ⟂     =   𝐤  ×   𝐯  ⟂     ,        𝐰    𝐤  𝐯          𝐤     subscript  𝐯  parallel-to    subscript  𝐯  perpendicular-to              𝐤   subscript  𝐯  parallel-to      𝐤   subscript  𝐯  perpendicular-to            𝐤   subscript  𝐯  perpendicular-to       \mathbf{w}=\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{k}\times(\mathbf{v}_{\parallel}+%
 \mathbf{v}_{\perp})=\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{v}_{\parallel}+\mathbf{k}\times%
 \mathbf{v}_{\perp}=\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{v}_{\perp},   since   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   has unit length, is parallel to and is perpendicular to .  The vector   𝐰   𝐰   \mathbf{w}   can be viewed as a copy of rotated by    90  °      90  normal-°    90°   about   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   . Through trigonometry, one may now rotate by   θ   θ   θ   around   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   to obtain . Consequently,      𝐯    ⟂  rot      subscript  𝐯   perpendicular-to  absent  rot     \displaystyle\mathbf{v}_{\perp\ \mathrm{rot}}   Moreover, is also the rejection from   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   of the vector , defined as the desired vector,   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   rotated about   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   by the angle   θ   θ   θ   .  Since is not affected by a rotation about   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   , the projection of on   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   coincides with . Thus,      𝐯  rot     subscript  𝐯  rot    \displaystyle\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{rot}}   as stated.  Matrix notation  Representing   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   and   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   as column matrices , permits defining a matrix   𝐊   𝐊   \mathbf{K}   as the " cross-product matrix " for the vector   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   , i.e.,       𝐊  =   [     0     -   k  3       k  2        k  3     0     -   k  1         -   k  2       k  1     0     ]    .      𝐊   delimited-[]    0     subscript  k  3     subscript  k  2      subscript  k  3   0     subscript  k  1         subscript  k  2     subscript  k  1   0       \mathbf{K}=\left[\begin{array}[]{ccc}0&-k_{3}&k_{2}\\
 k_{3}&0&-k_{1}\\
 -k_{2}&k_{1}&0\end{array}\right].     This matrix can be easily checked to have the property that      𝐊𝐯  =   𝐤  ×  𝐯       𝐊𝐯    𝐤  𝐯     \mathbf{K}\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{v}   for any vector   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   . (In fact,   𝐊   𝐊   \mathbf{K}   is the unique matrix with this property.)  Now, from the last equation in the previous sub-section, one may write      𝐯  rot     subscript  𝐯  rot    \displaystyle\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{rot}}     In order to collect cosine terms, we expand   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   cos   θ   θ   θ   :      𝐯  rot     subscript  𝐯  rot    \displaystyle\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{rot}}   To simplify further, use the standard formula for the vector triple product ,       𝐚  ×   (   𝐛  ×  𝐜   )    =    𝐛   (   𝐚  ⋅  𝐜   )    -   𝐜   (   𝐚  ⋅  𝐛   )           𝐚    𝐛  𝐜        𝐛   normal-⋅  𝐚  𝐜      𝐜   normal-⋅  𝐚  𝐛       \mathbf{a}\times(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{c})=\mathbf{b}(\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf%
 {c})-\mathbf{c}(\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b})   with    𝐚  =  𝐛  =  𝐤        𝐚  𝐛       𝐤     \mathbf{a}=\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{k}   , and    𝐜  =  𝐯      𝐜  𝐯    \mathbf{c}=\mathbf{v}   , to obtain       (    𝐤   (   𝐤  ⋅  𝐯   )    -  𝐯   )   =   𝐤  ×   (   𝐤  ×  𝐯   )            𝐤   normal-⋅  𝐤  𝐯    𝐯     𝐤    𝐤  𝐯      (\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v})-\mathbf{v})=\mathbf{k}\times(\mathbf{k}%
 \times\mathbf{v})   or         𝐤   (   𝐤  ⋅  𝐯   )    -  𝐯   =    𝐊  2    𝐯     .          𝐤   normal-⋅  𝐤  𝐯    𝐯      superscript  𝐊  2   𝐯     \mathbf{k}(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{v})-\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{K}^{2}\mathbf{v}~{}.     This amounts to (substituting the above equation in the last one for ),        𝐯  rot   =   𝐯  +    (   sin  θ   )   𝐊𝐯   +    (   1  -   cos  θ    )    𝐊  2    𝐯      ,       subscript  𝐯  rot     𝐯      θ   𝐊𝐯       1    θ     superscript  𝐊  2   𝐯      \mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{rot}}=\mathbf{v}+(\sin\theta)\mathbf{K}\mathbf{v}+(1-\cos%
 \theta)\mathbf{K}^{2}\mathbf{v}~{},   resulting in the Rodrigues' rotation formula in matrix notation ,      𝐯  rot     subscript  𝐯  rot    \displaystyle\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{rot}}   where   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   is the rotation matrix Since   𝐊   𝐊   \mathbf{K}   is defined in terms of the components of the rotation axis   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   , and   θ   θ   θ   is the rotation angle,   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   is the rotation matrix about   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   by angle   θ   θ   θ   .   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   is an element of the rotation group    S  O   (  3  )       S  O  3    SO(3)   of , and   𝐊   𝐊   \mathbf{K}   is an element of the Lie algebra     𝐬𝐨   (  3  )       𝐬𝐨  3    \mathbf{so}(3)   generating that Lie group (note that   𝐊   𝐊   \mathbf{K}   is skew-symmetric, which characterizes    𝐬𝐨   (  3  )       𝐬𝐨  3    \mathbf{so}(3)   ): In terms of the matrix exponential,       𝐑  =   exp   (   θ  𝐊   )     .      𝐑      θ  𝐊      \mathbf{R}=\exp(\theta\mathbf{K})~{}.   To see that the last identity holds, one notes that         𝐑   (  θ  )   𝐑   (  ϕ  )    =   𝐑   (   θ  +  ϕ   )     ,    𝐑   (  0  )    =   𝐈     ,     formulae-sequence      𝐑  θ  𝐑  ϕ     𝐑    θ  ϕ         𝐑  0   𝐈     \mathbf{R}(\theta)\mathbf{R}(\phi)=\mathbf{R}(\theta+\phi),\quad\mathbf{R}(0)=%
