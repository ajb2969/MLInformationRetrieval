   Prime constant      Prime constant   The prime constant is the real number    ρ   ρ   \rho   whose   n   n   n   th binary digit is 1 if   n   n   n   is prime and 0 if n is composite or 1.  In other words,   ρ   ρ   \rho   is simply the number whose binary expansion corresponds to the indicator function of the set of prime numbers . That is,      ρ  =    ∑  p    1   2  p     =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞      χ  ℙ    (  n  )     2  n           ρ    subscript   p     1   superscript  2  p            superscript   subscript     n  1           subscript  χ  ℙ   n    superscript  2  n        \rho=\sum_{p}\frac{1}{2^{p}}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\chi_{\mathbb{P}}(n)}{2^%
 {n}}   where   p   p   p   indicates a prime and    χ  ℙ     subscript  χ  ℙ    \chi_{\mathbb{P}}   is the characteristic function of the primes.  The beginning of the decimal expansion of ρ is    ρ  =   0.414682509851111660248109622  …       ρ    0.414682509851111660248109622  normal-…     \rho=0.414682509851111660248109622\ldots     The beginning of the binary expansion is    ρ  =   0.011010100010100010100010000   …  2        ρ    0.011010100010100010100010000   subscript  normal-…  2      \rho=0.011010100010100010100010000\ldots_{2}     Irrationality  The number   ρ   ρ   \rho   is easily shown to be irrational . To see why, suppose it were rational.  Denote the   k   k   k   th digit of the binary expansion of   ρ   ρ   \rho   by    r  k     subscript  r  k    r_{k}   . Then, since   ρ   ρ   \rho   is assumed rational, there must exist   N   N   N   ,   k   k   k   positive integers such that     r  n   =   r   n  +   i  k          subscript  r  n    subscript  r    n    i  k       r_{n}=r_{n+ik}   for all    n  >  N      n  N    n>N   and all    i  ∈  ℕ      i  ℕ    i\in\mathbb{N}   .  Since there are an infinite number of primes, we may choose a prime    p  >  N      p  N    p>N   . By definition we see that     r  p   =  1       subscript  r  p   1    r_{p}=1   . As noted, we have     r  p   =   r   p  +   i  k          subscript  r  p    subscript  r    p    i  k       r_{p}=r_{p+ik}   for all    i  ∈  ℕ      i  ℕ    i\in\mathbb{N}   . Now consider the case    i  =  p      i  p    i=p   . We have     r   p  +   i  ⋅  k     =   r   p  +   p  ⋅  k     =   r   p   (   k  +  1   )     =  0         subscript  r    p   normal-⋅  i  k      subscript  r    p   normal-⋅  p  k           subscript  r    p    k  1          0     r_{p+i\cdot k}=r_{p+p\cdot k}=r_{p(k+1)}=0   , since    p   (   k  +  1   )       p    k  1     p(k+1)   is composite because     k  +  1   ≥  2        k  1   2    k+1\geq 2   . Since     r  p   ≠   r   p   (   k  +  1   )          subscript  r  p    subscript  r    p    k  1       r_{p}\neq r_{p(k+1)}   we see that   ρ   ρ   \rho   is irrational.
