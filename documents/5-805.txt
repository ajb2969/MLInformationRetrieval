Prime constant

The prime constant is the real number

 
  whose 
 
 
 
 th binary digit is 1 if 
 
 
 
  is prime and 0 if n is composite or 1.
In other words, 
 
 
 
  is simply the number whose binary expansion corresponds to the indicator function of the set of prime numbers. That is,


 
  where 
 
 
 
  indicates a prime and 
 
 
 
  is the characteristic function of the primes.

Irrationality
The number 
 
 
 
  is easily shown to be irrational. To see why, suppose it were rational.
Denote the 
 
 
 
 th digit of the binary expansion of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . Then, since 
 
 
 
  is assumed rational, there must exist 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  positive integers such that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and all 
 
 
 
 .
Since there are an infinite number of primes, we may choose a prime 
 
 
 
 . By definition we see that 
 
 
 
 . As noted, we have 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . Now consider the case 
 
 
 
 . We have 
 
 
 
 , since 
 
 
 
  is composite because 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  we see that 
 
 
 
  is irrational.
