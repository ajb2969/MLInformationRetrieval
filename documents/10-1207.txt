Fructose 5-dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a fructose 5-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-fructose + acceptor 
 
 
 
  5-dehydro-D-fructose + reduced acceptor
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-fructose and acceptor, whereas its two products are 5-dehydro-D-fructose and reduced acceptor.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-fructose:acceptor 5-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include fructose 5-dehydrogenase (acceptor), D-fructose dehydrogenase, and D-fructose:(acceptor) 5-oxidoreductase.
