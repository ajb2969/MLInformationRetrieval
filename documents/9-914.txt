   Fraser Filter      Fraser Filter   A Fraser Filter , named after Douglas Fraser, is typically used in geophysics when displaying VLF data. It is effectively the first derivative of the data.  If     f   (  i  )    =   f  i         f  i    subscript  f  i     f(i)=f_{i}   represents the collected data then     a  v  e  r  a  g   e  12    =     f  1   +   f  2    2         a  v  e  r  a  g   subscript  e  12         subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2    2     average_{12}=\frac{f_{1}+f_{2}}{2}   is the average of two values. Consider this value to be plotted between point 1 and point 2 and do the same with points 3 and 4     a  v  e  r  a  g   e  34    =     f  3   +   f  4    2         a  v  e  r  a  g   subscript  e  34         subscript  f  3    subscript  f  4    2     average_{34}=\frac{f_{3}+f_{4}}{2}     If    Δ  x      normal-Δ  x    \Delta x   represents the space between each station along the line then       a  v  e  r  a  g   e  12    -   a  v  e  r  a  g   e  34      2  Δ  x    =     (    f  1   +   f  2    )   -   (    f  3   +   f  4    )     4  Δ  x              a  v  e  r  a  g   subscript  e  12      a  v  e  r  a  g   subscript  e  34       2  normal-Δ  x           subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2       subscript  f  3    subscript  f  4       4  normal-Δ  x      \frac{average_{12}-average_{34}}{2\Delta x}=\frac{(f_{1}+f_{2})-(f_{3}+f_{4})}%
 {4\Delta x}   is the Fraser Filter of those four values.  Since    4  Δ  x      4  normal-Δ  x    4\Delta x   is constant, it can be ignored and the Fraser Filter considered to be     (    f  1   +   f  2    )   -   (    f  3   +   f  4    )          subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2       subscript  f  3    subscript  f  4      (f_{1}+f_{2})-(f_{3}+f_{4})   .
