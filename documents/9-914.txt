Fraser Filter

A Fraser Filter, named after Douglas Fraser, is typically used in geophysics when displaying VLF data. It is effectively the first derivative of the data.
If 
 
 
 
  represents the collected data then 
 
 
 
 
  is the average of two values. Consider this value to be plotted between point 1 and point 2 and do the same with points 3 and 4
 
 

If 
 
 
 
  represents the space between each station along the line then 
 
 
 
  is the Fraser Filter of those four values.
Since 
 
 
 
  is constant, it can be ignored and the Fraser Filter considered to be 
 
 
 
 
 .
