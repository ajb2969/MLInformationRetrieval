Hesse normal form

 The Hesse normal form named after Otto Hesse, is an equation used in analytic geometry, and describes a line in 
 
 
 
  or a plane in Euclidean space 
 
 
 
  or a hyperplane in higher dimensions.1 It is primarily used for calculating distances, and is written in vector notation as



This equation is satisfied by all points P described by the location vector 
 
 
 
 , which lie precisely in the plane E (or in 2D, on the line g).
The vector 
 
 
 
  represents the unit normal vector of E or g, that points from the origin of the coordinate system to the plane (or line, in 2D). The distance 
 
 
 
  is the distance from the origin to the plane (or line). The dot 
 
 
 
  indicates the scalar product or dot product.
Derivation/Calculation from the normal form
Note: For simplicity, the following derivation discusses the 3D case. However, it is also applicable in 2D.
In the normal form,



a plane is given by a normal vector 
 
 
 
  as well as an arbitrary position vector 
 
 
 
  of a point 
 
 
 
 . The direction of 
 
 
 
  is chosen to satisfy the following inequality



By dividing the normal vector 
 
 
 
  by its Magnitude

 
 , we obtain the unit (or normalized) normal vector



and the above equation can be rewritten as



Substituting



we obtain the Hesse normal form

In this diagram, d is the distance from the origin. Because 
 
 
 
  holds for every point in the plane, it is also true at point Q (the point where the vector from the origin meets the plane E), with 
 
 
 
 , per the definition of the Scalar product



The magnitude 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is the shortest distance from the origin to the plane.
