   Hesse normal form      Hesse normal form   The Hesse normal form named after Otto Hesse , is an equation used in analytic geometry , and describes a line in    ℝ  2     superscript  ℝ  2    \mathbb{R}^{2}   or a plane in Euclidean space    ℝ  3     superscript  ℝ  3    \mathbb{R}^{3}   or a hyperplane in higher dimensions. 1 It is primarily used for calculating distances, and is written in vector notation as         r  →   ⋅    n  →   0    -  d   =   0.          normal-⋅   normal-→  r    subscript   normal-→  n   0    d   0.    \vec{r}\cdot\vec{n}_{0}-d=0.\,     This equation is satisfied by all points P described by the location vector    r  →     normal-→  r    \vec{r}   , which lie precisely in the plane E (or in 2D, on the line g ).  The vector     n  →   0     subscript   normal-→  n   0    \vec{n}_{0}   represents the unit normal vector of E or g , that points from the origin of the coordinate system to the plane (or line, in 2D). The distance    d  ≥  0      d  0    d\geq 0   is the distance from the origin to the plane (or line). The dot   ⋅   normal-⋅   \cdot   indicates the scalar product or dot product.  Derivation/Calculation from the normal form  Note: For simplicity, the following derivation discusses the 3D case. However, it is also applicable in 2D.  In the normal form,        (    r  →   -   a  →    )   ⋅   n  →    =   0        normal-⋅     normal-→  r    normal-→  a     normal-→  n    0    (\vec{r}-\vec{a})\cdot\vec{n}=0\,     a plane is given by a normal vector    n  →     normal-→  n    \vec{n}   as well as an arbitrary position vector    a  →     normal-→  a    \vec{a}   of a point    A  ∈  E      A  E    A\in E   . The direction of    n  →     normal-→  n    \vec{n}   is chosen to satisfy the following inequality        a  →   ⋅   n  →    ≥   0        normal-⋅   normal-→  a    normal-→  n    0    \vec{a}\cdot\vec{n}\geq 0\,     By dividing the normal vector    n  →     normal-→  n    \vec{n}   by its Magnitude     |   n  →   |       normal-→  n     |\vec{n}|   , we obtain the unit (or normalized) normal vector        n  →   0   =     n  →    |   n  →   |          subscript   normal-→  n   0      normal-→  n      normal-→  n       \vec{n}_{0}={{\vec{n}}\over{|\vec{n}|}}\,     and the above equation can be rewritten as        (    r  →   -   a  →    )   ⋅    n  →   0    =   0.        normal-⋅     normal-→  r    normal-→  a     subscript   normal-→  n   0    0.    (\vec{r}-\vec{a})\cdot\vec{n}_{0}=0.\,     Substituting      d  =    a  →   ⋅    n  →   0    ≥   0         d   normal-⋅   normal-→  a    subscript   normal-→  n   0         0     d=\vec{a}\cdot\vec{n}_{0}\geq 0\,     we obtain the Hesse normal form         r  →   ⋅    n  →   0    -  d   =   0.          normal-⋅   normal-→  r    subscript   normal-→  n   0    d   0.    \vec{r}\cdot\vec{n}_{0}-d=0.\,      (Figure)  Ebene Hessesche Normalform.PNG    In this diagram, d is the distance from the origin. Because      r  →   ⋅    n  →   0    =  d       normal-⋅   normal-→  r    subscript   normal-→  n   0    d    \vec{r}\cdot\vec{n}_{0}=d   holds for every point in the plane, it is also true at point Q (the point where the vector from the origin meets the plane E), with     r  →   =    r  →   s        normal-→  r    subscript   normal-→  r   s     \vec{r}=\vec{r}_{s}   , per the definition of the Scalar product       d  =     r  →   s   ⋅    n  →   0    =    |    r  →   s   |   ⋅   |    n  →   0   |   ⋅   cos   (   0  ∘   )     =    |    r  →   s   |   ⋅  1   =   |    r  →   s   |    .        d   normal-⋅   subscript   normal-→  r   s    subscript   normal-→  n   0          normal-⋅     subscript   normal-→  r   s       subscript   normal-→  n   0       superscript  0            normal-⋅     subscript   normal-→  r   s    1           subscript   normal-→  r   s       d=\vec{r}_{s}\cdot\vec{n}_{0}=|\vec{r}_{s}|\cdot|\vec{n}_{0}|\cdot\cos(0^{%
