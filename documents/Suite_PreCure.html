She often assists the Pretty Cures if they are trapped, but leaves them to finish off the Negatones.

She often declares that she will not partner herself with the Cures until the time is right.

He is responsible for turning Mephisto evil, as his song can brainwash whoever hears it. Though Otokichi sealed Noise away inside a fossil, Falsetto has been trying to revive him by playing the Melody of Sorrow to draw energy from those who fall into sorrow listening to him. After Noise breaks free from the seal upon hearing an incomplete Melody of Sorrow, he assumes a chick-like form that Ako named , and used this form to get close to the Cures and steal their Notes. However, he was soon discovered to be Noise after he attempted to attack Otokichi. Once the Melody of Sorrows is completed, Noise's resurrection is completed as he resumes his attack on Major Land. After absorbing Bassdrum and Baritone, Noise assumed a more human-like form to overpower the Cures.
