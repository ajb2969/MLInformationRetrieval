J-homomorphism

In mathematics, the J-homomorphism is a mapping from the homotopy groups of the special orthogonal groups to the homotopy groups of spheres. It was defined by , extending a construction of .
Definition
Whitehead's original homomorphism is defined geometrically, and gives a homomorphism



of abelian groups for integers q, and r ≥ 2. (Hopf defined this for the special case q=r+1.)
The J-homomorphism can be defined as follows. An element of the special orthogonal group SO(q) can be regarded as a map


 
  and the homotopy group πr(SO(q)) consists of homotopy-equivalence classes of maps from the r-sphere to SO(q). Thus an element of πr(SO(q)) can be represented by a map


 
  Applying the Hopf construction to this gives a map


 
  in πr+q(Sq), which Whitehead defined as the image of the element of πr(SO(q)) under the J-homomorphism.
Taking a limit as q tends to infinity gives the stable J-homomorphism in stable homotopy theory:



where SO is the infinite special orthogonal group, and the right-hand side is the r-th stable stem of the stable homotopy groups of spheres.
Image of the J-homomorphism
The image of the J-homomorphism was described by , assuming the Adams conjecture of  which was proved by , as follows. The group πr(SO) is given by Bott periodicity. It is always cyclic; and if r is positive, it is of order 2 if r is 0 or 1 mod 8, infinite if r is 3 mod 4, and order 1 otherwise . In particular the image of the stable J-homomorphism is cyclic. The stable homotopy groups πrS are the direct sum of the (cyclic) image of the J-homomorphism, and the kernel of the Adams e-invariant , a homomorphism from the stable homotopy groups to Q/Z. The order of the image is 2 if r is 0 or 1 mod 8 and positive (so in this case the J-homomorphism is injective). If r = 4n−1 is 3 mod 4 and positive the image is a cyclic group of order equal to the denominator of B2n/4n, where B2n is a Bernoulli number. In the remaining cases where r is 2, 4, 5, or 6 mod 8 the image is trivial because πr(SO) is trivial.

Applications
introduced the group J(X) of a space X, which for X a sphere is the image of the J-homomorphism in a suitable dimension.
The cokernel of the J-homomorphism appears in the group of exotic spheres ().
