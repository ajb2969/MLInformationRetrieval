   J-homomorphism      J-homomorphism   In mathematics , the J -homomorphism is a mapping from the homotopy groups of the special orthogonal groups to the homotopy groups of spheres . It was defined by , extending a construction of .  Definition  Whitehead's original homomorphism is defined geometrically, and gives a homomorphism      J  :     π  r    (   SO   (  q  )    )    →    π   r  +  q     (   S  q   )        normal-:  J   normal-→     subscript  π  r     SO  q       subscript  π    r  q     superscript  S  q       J\colon\pi_{r}(\mathrm{SO}(q))\to\pi_{r+q}(S^{q})\,\!     of abelian groups for integers q , and r ≥ 2. (Hopf defined this for the special case q = r +1.)  The J -homomorphism can be defined as follows. An element of the special orthogonal group SO( q ) can be regarded as a map       S   q  -  1    →   S   q  -  1       normal-→   superscript  S    q  1     superscript  S    q  1      S^{q-1}\rightarrow S^{q-1}   and the homotopy group π r (SO( q )) consists of homotopy -equivalence classes of maps from the r -sphere to SO( q ). Thus an element of π r (SO( q )) can be represented by a map        S  r   ×   S   q  -  1     →   S   q  -  1       normal-→     superscript  S  r    superscript  S    q  1      superscript  S    q  1      S^{r}\times S^{q-1}\rightarrow S^{q-1}   Applying the Hopf construction to this gives a map       S   r  +  q    =    S  r   *   S   q  -  1     →   S   (   S   q  -  1    )    =   S  q          superscript  S    r  q       superscript  S  r    superscript  S    q  1       normal-→      S   superscript  S    q  1           superscript  S  q      S^{r+q}=S^{r}*S^{q-1}\rightarrow S(S^{q-1})=S^{q}   in π r + q ( S q ), which Whitehead defined as the image of the element of π r (SO( q )) under the J-homomorphism.  Taking a limit as q tends to infinity gives the stable J -homomorphism in stable homotopy theory :       J  :     π  r    (  SO  )    →   π  r  S     ,     normal-:  J   normal-→     subscript  π  r   SO    superscript   subscript  π  r   S      J\colon\pi_{r}(\mathrm{SO})\to\pi_{r}^{S},\,\!     where SO is the infinite special orthogonal group , and the right-hand side is the r -th stable stem of the stable homotopy groups of spheres .  Image of the J-homomorphism  The image of the J -homomorphism was described by , assuming the Adams conjecture of  which was proved by , as follows. The group π r (SO) is given by Bott periodicity . It is always cyclic; and if r is positive, it is of order 2 if r is 0 or 1 mod 8, infinite if r is 3 mod 4, and order 1 otherwise . In particular the image of the stable J -homomorphism is cyclic. The stable homotopy groups π r S are the direct sum of the (cyclic) image of the J -homomorphism, and the kernel of the Adams e-invariant , a homomorphism from the stable homotopy groups to Q / Z . The order of the image is 2 if r is 0 or 1 mod 8 and positive (so in this case the J -homomorphism is injective). If r = 4 n −1 is 3 mod 4 and positive the image is a cyclic group of order equal to the denominator of B 2 n /4 n , where B 2 n is a Bernoulli number . In the remaining cases where r is 2, 4, 5, or 6 mod 8 the image is trivial because π r (SO) is trivial.        r   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16   17       π r (SO)   1   2   1   Z   1   1   1   Z   2   2   1   Z   1   1   1   Z   2   2     |im( J )|   1   2   1   24   1   1   1   240   2   2   1   504   1   1   1   480   2   2     π r S   Z   2   2   24   1   1   2   240   2 2   2 3   6   504   1   3   2 2   480×2   2 2   2 4     B 2 n      1 ⁄ 6      − 1 ⁄ 30      1 ⁄ 42      − 1 ⁄ 30         Applications  introduced the group J ( X ) of a space X , which for X a sphere is the image of the J -homomorphism in a suitable dimension.  The cokernel of the J -homomorphism appears in the group of exotic spheres ().  References                 "  Category:Homotopy theory  Category:Topology of Lie groups
