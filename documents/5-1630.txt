   Dual code      Dual code   In coding theory , the dual code of a linear code      C  ⊂   𝔽  q  n       C   superscript   subscript  𝔽  q   n     C\subset\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}     is the linear code defined by       C  ⟂   =   {   x  ∈   𝔽  q  n    ∣    ⟨  x  ,  c  ⟩   =    0    ∀  c    ∈  C   }        superscript  C  perpendicular-to    conditional-set    x   superscript   subscript  𝔽  q   n         x  c     0   for-all  c         C       C^{\perp}=\{x\in\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}\mid\langle x,c\rangle=0\;\forall c\in C\}     where       ⟨  x  ,  c  ⟩   =    ∑   i  =  1   n     x  i    c  i          x  c     superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  x  i    subscript  c  i       \langle x,c\rangle=\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}c_{i}     is a scalar product. In linear algebra terms, the dual code is the annihilator of C with respect to the bilinear form . The dimension of C and its dual always add up to the length n :         dim  C   +   dim   C  ⟂     =  n   .         dimension  C    dimension   superscript  C  perpendicular-to     n    \dim C+\dim C^{\perp}=n.     A generator matrix for the dual code is a parity-check matrix for the original code and vice versa. The dual of the dual code is always the original code.  Self-dual codes  A self-dual code is one which is its own dual. This implies that n is even and dim C = n /2. If a self-dual code is such that each codeword's weight is a multiple of some constant    c  >  1      c  1    c>1   , then it is of one of the following four types: 1   Type I codes are binary self-dual codes which are not doubly even . Type I codes are always even (every codeword has even Hamming weight ).  Type II codes are binary self-dual codes which are doubly even.  Type III codes are ternary self-dual codes. Every codeword in a Type III code has Hamming weight divisible by 3.  Type IV codes are self-dual codes over F 4 . These are again even.   Codes of types I, II, III, or IV exist only if the length n is a multiple of 2, 8, 4, or 2 respectively.
