   Complex vector bundle      Complex vector bundle   In mathematics, a complex vector bundle is a vector bundle whose fibers are complex vector spaces .  Any complex vector bundle can be viewed as a real vector bundle through the restriction of scalars . Conversely, any real vector bundle E can be promoted to a complex vector bundle, the complexification      E  ⊗  ℂ     tensor-product  E  ℂ    E\otimes\mathbb{C}   ; whose fibers are E x ⊗ R  C .  Any complex vector bundle over a paracompact space admits a hermitian metric .  The basic invariant of a complex vector bundle is a Chern class .  Complex structure  A complex vector bundle can be thought of as a real vector bundle with an additional structure, the complex structure . By definition, a complex structure is a bundle map between a real vector bundle E and itself:      J  :   E  →  E      normal-:  J   normal-→  E  E     J:E\to E   such that J acts as the square root i of -1 on fibers: if     J  x   :    E  x   →   E  x       normal-:   subscript  J  x    normal-→   subscript  E  x    subscript  E  x      J_{x}:E_{x}\to E_{x}   is the map on fiber-level, then     J  x  2   =   -  1        superscript   subscript  J  x   2     1     J_{x}^{2}=-1   as a linear map. If E is a complex vector bundle, then the complex structure J can be defined by setting    J  x     subscript  J  x    J_{x}   to be the scalar multiplication by   i   i   i   . Conversely, if E is a real vector bundle with a complex structure J , then E can be turned into a complex vector bundle by setting: for any real numbers a , b and a real vector v in a fiber E x ,         (   a  +   i  b    )   v   =    a  v   +   J   (   b  v   )      .          a    i  b    v       a  v     J    b  v       (a+ib)v=av+J(bv).     Example : A complex structure on the tangent bundle of a real manifold M is usually called an almost complex structure . A theorem of Newlander and Nirenberg says that an almost complex structure J is "integrable" in the sense it is induced by a structure of a complex manifold if and only if a certain tensor involving J vanishes.  Conjugate bundle  If E is a complex vector bundle, then the conjugate bundle     E  ¯     normal-¯  E    \overline{E}   of E is obtained by having complex numbers acting through the complex conjugates of the numbers. Thus, the identity map of the underlying real vector bundles     E  ℝ   →    E  ¯   ℝ   =   E  ℝ        normal-→   subscript  E  ℝ    subscript   normal-¯  E   ℝ         subscript  E  ℝ      E_{\mathbb{R}}\to\overline{E}_{\mathbb{R}}=E_{\mathbb{R}}   is conjugate-linear, and E and its conjugate    E  ¯     normal-¯  E    \overline{E}   are isomorphic as real vector bundle.  The k -th Chern class of    E  ¯     normal-¯  E    \overline{E}   is given by        c  k    (   E  ¯   )    =     (   -  1   )   k    c  k    (  E  )           subscript  c  k    normal-¯  E       superscript    1   k    subscript  c  k   E     c_{k}(\overline{E})=(-1)^{k}c_{k}(E)   . In particular, E and    E  ¯     normal-¯  E    \overline{E}   are not isomorphic in general.  If E has a hermitian metric, then the conjugate bundle    E  ¯     normal-¯  E    \overline{E}   is isomorphic to the dual bundle      E  *   =   Hom   (  E  ,  𝒪  )         superscript  E     Hom  E  𝒪     E^{*}=\operatorname{Hom}(E,\mathcal{O})   through the metric, where we wrote   𝒪   𝒪   \mathcal{O}   for the trivial complex line bundle.  If E is a real vector bundle, then the underlying real vector bundle of the complexification of E is a direct sum of two copies of E :        (   E  ⊗  ℂ   )   ℝ   =   E  ⊕  E        subscript   tensor-product  E  ℂ   ℝ    direct-sum  E  E     (E\otimes\mathbb{C})_{\mathbb{R}}=E\oplus E   (since V ⊗ R C = V ⊕ i V for any real vector space V .) If a complex vector bundle E is the complexification of a real vector bundle E{{'}} , then E{{'}} is called a real form of E (there may be more than one real form) and E is said to be defined over the real numbers. If E has a real form, then E is isomorphic to its conjugate (since they are both sum of two copies of a real form), and consequently the odd Chern classes of E have order 2.
