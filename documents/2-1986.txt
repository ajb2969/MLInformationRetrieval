   Hardy space      Hardy space   In complex analysis , the Hardy spaces (or Hardy classes ) H p are certain spaces of holomorphic functions on the unit disk or upper half plane . They were introduced by Frigyes Riesz , who named them after G. H. Hardy , because of the paper . In real analysis  Hardy spaces are certain spaces of distributions on the real line, which are (in the sense of distributions) boundary values of the holomorphic functions of the complex Hardy spaces, and are related to the L p spaces of functional analysis . For 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ these real Hardy spaces H p are certain subsets of L p , while for p p'' spaces have some undesirable properties, and the Hardy spaces are much better behaved.  There are also higher-dimensional generalizations, consisting of certain holomorphic functions on tube domains in the complex case, or certain spaces of distributions on R n in the real case.  Hardy spaces have a number of applications in mathematical analysis itself, as well as in control theory (such as H ∞ methods ) and in scattering theory .  Hardy spaces for the unit disk  For spaces of holomorphic functions on the open unit disk , the Hardy space H 2 consists of the functions f whose mean square value on the circle of radius r remains bounded as r → 1 from below.  More generally, the Hardy space H p for 0 \sup_{0  This class H p is a vector space. The number on the left side of the above inequality is the Hardy space p -norm for f , denoted by      ∥  f  ∥    H  p    .     subscript   norm  f    superscript  H  p     \|f\|_{H^{p}}.   It is a norm when p ≥ 1, but not when 0 ∞ is defined as the vector space of bounded holomorphic functions on the disk, with the norm         ∥  f  ∥    H  ∞    =    sup    |  z  |   <  1     |   f   (  z  )    |     .       subscript   norm  f    superscript  H       subscript  supremum      z   1        f  z       \|f\|_{H^{\infty}}=\sup_{|z|<1}\left|f(z)\right|.     For 0 q'' is a subset of H p , and the H p -norm is increasing with p (it is a consequence of Hölder's inequality that the L p -norm is increasing for probability measures , i.e. measures with total mass 1).  Hardy spaces on the unit circle  The Hardy spaces defined in the preceding section can also be viewed as certain closed vector subspaces of the complex L p spaces on the unit circle. This connection is provided by the following theorem : Given f ∈ H p , with p ≥ 0, the radial limit        f  ~    (   e   i  θ    )    =    lim   r  →  1     f   (   r   e   i  θ     )            normal-~  f    superscript  e    i  θ       subscript    normal-→  r  1      f    r   superscript  e    i  θ         \tilde{f}\left(e^{i\theta}\right)=\lim_{r\to 1}f\left(re^{i\theta}\right)     exists for almost every θ. The function    f  ~     normal-~  f    \tilde{f}   belongs to the L p space for the unit circle, and one has that         ∥   f  ~   ∥    L  p    =    ∥  f  ∥    H  p     .       subscript   norm   normal-~  f     superscript  L  p     subscript   norm  f    superscript  H  p      \|\tilde{f}\|_{L^{p}}=\|f\|_{H^{p}}.     Denoting the unit circle by T , and by H p ( T ) the vector subspace of L p ( T ) consisting of all limit functions    f  ~     normal-~  f    \tilde{f}   , when f varies in H p , one then has that for p ≥ 1,       g  ∈    H  p    (  𝐓  )   if and only if  g   ∈    L  p    (  𝐓  )   and   g  ^    (  n  )    =   0  for all  n   <  0   ,        g     superscript  H  p   𝐓  if and only if  g           superscript  L  p   𝐓  and   normal-^  g   n          0  for all  n        0     g\in H^{p}\left(\mathbf{T}\right)\text{ if and only if }g\in L^{p}\left(%
 \mathbf{T}\right)\text{ and }\hat{g}(n)=0\text{ for all }n<0,     where the ĝ ( n ) are the Fourier coefficients of a function g integrable on the unit circle,         ∀  n   ∈  𝐙   ,     g  ^    (  n  )    =    1   2  π      ∫  0   2  π     g   (   e   i  ϕ    )     e   -   i  n  ϕ      d  ϕ       .     formulae-sequence     for-all  n   𝐙        normal-^  g   n       1    2  π      superscript   subscript   0     2  π      g   superscript  e    i  ϕ     superscript  e      i  n  ϕ     normal-d  ϕ        \forall n\in\mathbf{Z},\ \ \ \hat{g}(n)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}g\left(e^%
 {i\phi}\right)e^{-in\phi}\,\mathrm{d}\phi.     The space H p ( T ) is a closed subspace of L p ( T ). Since L p ( T ) is a Banach space (for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞), so is H p ( T ).  The above can be turned around. Given a function    f  ~     normal-~  f    \tilde{f}   ∈ L p ( T ), with p ≥ 1, one can regain a ( harmonic ) function f on the unit disk by means of the Poisson kernel  P r :         f   (   r   e   i  θ     )    =    1   2  π      ∫  0   2  π      P  r    (   θ  -  ϕ   )    f  ~    (   e   i  ϕ    )   d  ϕ      ,   r  <  1    ,     formulae-sequence      f    r   superscript  e    i  θ          1    2  π      superscript   subscript   0     2  π       subscript  P  r     θ  ϕ    normal-~  f    superscript  e    i  ϕ    normal-d  ϕ        r  1     f\left(re^{i\theta}\right)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}P_{r}(\theta-\phi)%
 \tilde{f}\left(e^{i\phi}\right)\,\mathrm{d}\phi,\quad r<1,     and f belongs to H p exactly when    f  ~     normal-~  f    \tilde{f}   is in H p ( T ). Supposing that    f  ~     normal-~  f    \tilde{f}   is in H p ( T ). i.e. that    f  ~     normal-~  f    \tilde{f}   has Fourier coefficients ( a n ) n ∈ Z with a n = 0 for every n p'' associated to    f  ~     normal-~  f    \tilde{f}   is the holomorphic function        f   (  z  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     a  n    z  n      ,    |  z  |   <  1.      formulae-sequence      f  z     superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  a  n    superscript  z  n          z   1.     f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}z^{n},\ \ \ |z|<1.     In applications, those functions with vanishing negative Fourier coefficients are commonly interpreted as the causal solutions. Thus, the space H 2 is seen to sit naturally inside L 2 space, and is represented by infinite sequences indexed by N ; whereas L 2 consists of bi-infinite sequences indexed by Z .  Connection to real Hardy spaces on the circle  When 1 ≤ p p'' discussed further down in this article are easy to describe in the present context. A real function f on the unit circle belongs to the real Hardy space H p ( T ) if it is the real part of a function in H p ( T ), and a complex function f belongs to the real Hardy space iff Re( f ) and Im( f ) belong to the space (see the section on real Hardy spaces below).  For p F(z) = \frac{1 + z}{1 - z}, \quad |z|  for which        f   (   e   i  θ    )    :=    F  ~    (   e   i  θ    )    =    i    cot   (    θ  2    )      .       assign    f   superscript  e    i  θ        normal-~  F    superscript  e    i  θ            i      θ  2        f(e^{i\theta}):=\tilde{F}(e^{i\theta})=i\,\cot(\tfrac{\theta}{2}).     The function F is in H p for every p p ( T ) but Re( f'') is 0 almost everywhere. It is no longer possible to recover F from Re( f ), and one cannot define real- H p ( T ) in the simple way above.  For the same function F , let f r (e iθ ) = F ( re iθ ). The limit when r → 1 of Re( f r ), in the sense of  distributions on the circle, is a non-zero multiple of the Dirac distribution at z = 1. The Dirac distribution at any point of the unit circle belongs to real- H p ( T ) for every p p'' can be written as the product f = Gh where G is an outer function and h is an inner function , as defined below . This " Beurling factorization" allows the Hardy space to be completely characterized by the spaces of inner and outer functions.  One says that G ( z ) is an outer (exterior) function if it takes the form       G   (  z  )    =    c    exp   (    1   2  π      ∫   -  π   π       e   i  θ    +  z     e   i  θ    -  z      log    (    φ    (   e   i  θ    )    )    d  θ     )           G  z     c        1    2  π      superscript   subscript     π    π          superscript  e    i  θ    z      superscript  e    i  θ    z        φ   superscript  e    i  θ      normal-d  θ         G(z)=c\,\exp\left(\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\frac{e^{i\theta}+z}{e^{i%
 \theta}-z}\log\!\left(\varphi\!\left(e^{i\theta}\right)\right)\,\mathrm{d}%
 \theta\right)     for some complex number c with | c | = 1, and some positive measurable function   φ   φ   \varphi   on the unit circle such that    log   (  φ  )       φ    \log(\varphi)   is integrable on the circle. In particular, when   φ   φ   \varphi   is integrable on the circle, G is in H 1 because the above takes the form of the Poisson kernel . This implies that        lim   r  →   1  -      |   G   (   r   e   i  θ     )    |    =   φ   (   e   i  θ    )          subscript    normal-→  r   superscript  1          G    r   superscript  e    i  θ          φ   superscript  e    i  θ       \lim_{r\to 1^{-}}\left|G\left(re^{i\theta}\right)\right|=\varphi\left(e^{i%
 \theta}\right)     for almost every θ.  One says that h is an inner (interior) function if and only if | h | ≤ 1 on the unit disk and the limit       lim   r  →   1  -      h   (   r   e   i  θ     )        subscript    normal-→  r   superscript  1        h    r   superscript  e    i  θ        \lim_{r\to 1^{-}}h(re^{i\theta})     exists for almost all θ and its modulus is equal to 1. In particular, h is in H ∞ . The inner function can be further factored into a form involving a Blaschke product .  The function f , decomposed as f = Gh , is in H p if and only if the positive function φ belongs to L p ( T ), where φ is the function in the representation of the outer function G .  Let G be an outer function represented as above from a function φ on the circle. Replacing φ by φ α , α > 0, a family ( G α ) of outer functions is obtained, with the properties:   G 1 = G , G α+β = G α  G β and | G α | = | G | α almost everywhere on the circle.   It follows that whenever 0 r'' can be expressed as the product of a function in H p and a function in H q . For example: every function in H 1 is the product of two functions in H 2 ; every function in H p , p q'', q > 1.  Real-variable techniques on the unit circle  Real-variable techniques, mainly associated to the study of real Hardy spaces defined on R n (see below), are also used in the simpler framework of the circle. It is a common practice to allow for complex functions (or distributions) in these "real" spaces. The definition that follows does not distinguish between real or complex case.  Let P r denote the Poisson kernel on the unit circle T . For a distribution f on the unit circle, set        u   (   e   i  θ    )    =     a  0   2   +    ∑   k  ≥  1      a  k    cos   (   k  θ   )      +    b  k    sin   (   k  θ   )      ⟶   v   (   e   i  θ    )    =     ∑   k  ≥  1      a  k    sin   (   k  θ   )      -    b  k    cos   (   k  θ   )       .          u   superscript  e    i  θ          subscript  a  0   2     subscript     k  1       subscript  a  k       k  θ         subscript  b  k       k  θ        normal-⟶      v   superscript  e    i  θ              subscript     k  1       subscript  a  k       k  θ         subscript  b  k       k  θ         u(e^{i\theta})=\frac{a_{0}}{2}+\sum_{k\geq 1}a_{k}\cos(k\theta)+b_{k}\sin(k%
 \theta)\longrightarrow v(e^{i\theta})=\sum_{k\geq 1}a_{k}\sin(k\theta)-b_{k}%
 \cos(k\theta).     For 0 p''( T ) consists of distributions f such that M f is in L p ( T ).  The function F defined on the unit disk by F ( re iθ ) = ( f ∗ P r )(e iθ ) is harmonic, and M f is the radial maximal function of F . When M f belongs to L p ( T ) and p ≥ 1, the distribution f " is " a function in L p ( T ), namely the boundary value of F . For p ≥ 1, the real Hardy space  H p ( T ) is a subset of L p ( T ).  Conjugate function  To every real trigonometric polynomial u on the unit circle, one associates the real conjugate polynomial  v such that u + i v extends to a holomorphic function in the unit disk,        F   (  z  )    =    ∑   n  =  0    +  ∞      c  n    z  n      ,    |  z  |   <  1      formulae-sequence      F  z     superscript   subscript     n  0            subscript  c  n    superscript  z  n          z   1     F(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}c_{n}z^{n},\quad|z|<1     This mapping u → v extends to a bounded linear operator H on L p ( T ), when 1 1( T ) to weak- L 1 ( T ) . When 1 ≤ p p''( T )   the function f and its conjugate H(f) belong to L p ( T )  the radial maximal function M f belongs to L p ( T ).   When 1 p''( T ) when f ∈ L p ( T ), hence the real Hardy space H p ( T ) coincides with L p ( T ) in this case. For p = 1, the real Hardy space H 1 ( T ) is a proper subspace of L 1 ( T ).  The case of p = ∞ was excluded from the definition of real Hardy spaces, because the maximal function M f of an L ∞ function is always bounded, and because it is not desirable that real- H ∞ be equal to L ∞ . However, the two following properties are equivalent for a real valued function f   the function f is the real part of some function g ∈ H ∞ ( T )  the function f and its conjugate H(f) belong to L ∞ ( T ).   === Real Hardy spaces for 0 p'' cannot be reconstructed from the real part of its boundary limit function on the circle, because of the lack of convexity of L p in this case. Convexity fails but a kind of " complex convexity " remains, namely the fact that z → | z | q is subharmonic for every q > 0. As a consequence, if       ∑   n  =  0    +  ∞      c  n    e   i  n  θ         superscript   subscript     n  0            subscript  c  n    superscript  e    i  n  θ       \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}c_{n}e^{in\theta}     is in H p , it can be shown that c n = O( n 1/ p –1 ). It follows that the Fourier series         ∥  f  ∥    H  p    =    sup   y  >  0      (   ∫      |   f   (   x  +   i  y    )    |   p    d  x    )    1  p      .       subscript   norm  f    superscript  H  p      subscript  supremum    y  0     superscript       superscript      f    x    i  y      p   normal-d  x      1  p       \|f\|_{H^{p}}=\sup_{y>0}\left(\int|f(x+iy)|^{p}\,\mathrm{d}x\right)^{\frac{1}{%
 p}}.     converges in the sense of distributions to a distribution f on the unit circle, and F ( re iθ ) =( f ∗ P r )(θ). The function F ∈ H p can be reconstructed from the real distribution Re( f ) on the circle, because the Taylor coefficients c n of F can be computed from the Fourier coefficients of Re( f ): distributions on the circle are general enough for handling Hardy spaces when p − N (for | z | p'' when 0 p''( T ) iff it is the boundary value of the real part of some F ∈ H p . A Dirac distribution δ x , at any point x of the unit circle, belongs to real- H p ( T ) for every p  x belong when p  x when p p''( H ) on the upper half-plane  H is defined to be the space of holomorphic functions f on H with bounded (quasi-)norm, the norm being given by         ∥  f  ∥    H  ∞    =    sup   z  ∈  𝐇     |   f   (  z  )    |     .       subscript   norm  f    superscript  H       subscript  supremum    z  𝐇        f  z       \|f\|_{H^{\infty}}=\sup_{z\in\mathbf{H}}|f(z)|.     The corresponding H ∞ ( H ) is defined as functions of bounded norm, with the norm given by       m   (  z  )    =   i  ⋅    1  +  z    1  -  z           m  z    normal-⋅  i      1  z     1  z       m(z)=i\cdot\frac{1+z}{1-z}     Although the unit disk  D and the upper half-plane H can be mapped to one another by means of Möbius transformations , they are not interchangeable as domains for Hardy spaces. Contributing to this difference is the fact that the unit circle has finite (one-dimensional) Lebesgue measure while the real line does not. However, for H 2 , one may still state the following theorem: Given the Möbius transformation m : D → H with         (   M  f   )    (  z  )    =     π    1  -  z    f   (   m   (  z  )    )     .          M  f   z         π     1  z    f    m  z      (Mf)(z)=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{1-z}f(m(z)).     then there is an isometric  isomorphism  M : H 2 ( H ) → H 2 ( D ) with         f  k    (  x  )    =     𝟏   [  0  ,  1  ]     (   x  -  k   )    -    𝟏   [  0  ,  1  ]     (   x  +  k   )      ,   k  >  0.      formulae-sequence       subscript  f  k   x        subscript  1   0  1      x  k       subscript  1   0  1      x  k        k  0.     f_{k}(x)=\mathbf{1}_{[0,1]}(x-k)-\mathbf{1}_{[0,1]}(x+k),\ \ \ k>0.     Real Hardy spaces for R n  In analysis on the real vector space R n , the Hardy space H p (for 0 (M_\Phi f)(x)=\sup_{t>0}|(f*\Phi_t)(x)|  is in L p ( R n ), where ∗ is convolution and }}  . The H p - quasinorm || f || Hp of a distribution f of H p is defined to be the L p norm of M Φ f (this depends on the choice of Φ, but different choices of Schwartz functions Φ give equivalent norms). The H p -quasinorm is a norm when p ≥ 1, but not when p p'' is the same vector space as L p , with equivalent norm. When p = 1, the Hardy space H 1 is a proper subspace of L 1 . One can find sequences in H 1 that are bounded in L 1 but unbounded in H 1 , for example on the line        ∫   𝐑  n     f   (  x  )    x  1   i  1    …    x  n   i  n     d  x    ,      subscript    superscript  𝐑  n      f  x   superscript   subscript  x  1    subscript  i  1    normal-…   superscript   subscript  x  n    subscript  i  n    normal-d  x     \int_{\mathbf{R}^{n}}f(x)x_{1}^{i_{1}}\ldots x_{n}^{i_{n}}\,\mathrm{d}x,     The L 1 and H 1 norms are not equivalent on H 1 , and H 1 is not closed in L 1 . The dual of H 1 is the space BMO of functions of bounded mean oscillation . The space BMO contains unbounded functions (proving again that H 1 is not closed in L 1 ).  If p p'' has elements that are not functions, and its dual is the homogeneous Lipschitz space of order n (1/ p − 1). When p p''-quasinorm is not a norm, as it is not subadditive. The p th power || f || Hp p is subadditive for p p'', which defines the topology and makes H p into a complete metric space.  Atomic decomposition  When 0 p'' if and only if all its moments       f  =   ∑    c  j    a  j      ,    ∑    |   c  j   |   p    <  ∞      formulae-sequence    f       subscript  c  j    subscript  a  j           superscript     subscript  c  j    p        f=\sum c_{j}a_{j},\ \ \ \sum|c_{j}|^{p}<\infty     whose order i 1 + ... + i n is at most n (1/ p − 1), vanish. For example, the integral of f must vanish in order that f ∈ H p , 0   this is also sufficient.  If in addition f has support in some ball B and is bounded by | B | −1/ p then f is called an H p -atom (here | B | denotes the Euclidean volume of B in R n ). The H p -quasinorm of an arbitrary H p -atom is bounded by a constant depending only on p and on the Schwartz function Φ.  When 0 p'' has an atomic decomposition as a convergent infinite combination of H p -atoms,        M  *   =     sup   n  ≥  0      |   M  n   |     .       superscript  M      subscript  supremum    n  0       subscript  M  n       M^{*}=\sup_{n\geq 0}\,|M_{n}|.     where the a j are H p -atoms and the c j are scalars.  On the line for example, the difference of Dirac distributions f = δ 1 −δ 0 can be represented as a series of Haar functions , convergent in H p -quasinorm when 1/2 p'' when p ≤ 1/2 because their maximal function is equivalent at infinity to a  x −2 for some a ≠ 0).  Martingale H p  Let ( M n ) n ≥0 be a martingale on some probability space (Ω, Σ, P ), with respect to an increasing sequence of σ-fields (Σ n '') n ≥0 . Assume for simplicity that Σ is equal to the σ-field generated by the sequence (Σ n ) n ≥0 . The maximal function of the martingale is defined by       M  n   =  E   (  f  |   Σ  n   )      fragments   subscript  M  n    E   fragments  normal-(  f  normal-|   subscript  normal-Σ  n   normal-)     M_{n}=E\bigl(f|\Sigma_{n}\bigr)     Let 1 ≤ p n'') n ≥0 belongs to martingale - H p when M* ∈ L p .  If M* ∈ L p , the martingale ( M n ) n ≥0 is bounded in L p , hence it converges almost surely to some function f by the martingale convergence theorem . Moreover, M n converges to f in L p -norm by the dominated convergence theorem , hence M n can be expressed as conditional expectation of f on Σ n . It is thus possible to identify martingale- H p with the subspace of L p (Ω, Σ, P ) consisting of those f such that the martingale        S   (  f  )    =    (     |   M  0   |   2   +    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     |    M   n  +  1    -   M  n    |   2     )    1  2     .

 {2}}.     belongs to martingale- H p .  Doob's maximal inequality implies that martingale- H p coincides with L p (Ω, Σ, P ) when 1 1, whose dual is martingale- BMO .  The Burkholder–Gundy inequalities (when p > 1) and the Burgess Davis inequality (when p = 1) relate the L p -norm of the maximal function to that of the square function of the martingale       M  t   =   F   (   B   t  ∧  τ    )         subscript  M  t     F   subscript  B    t  τ       M_{t}=F(B_{t\wedge\tau})     Martingale- H p can be defined by saying that S ( f )∈ L p ..  Martingales with continuous time parameter can also be considered. A direct link with the classical theory is obtained via the complex Brownian motion ( B t ) in the complex plane, starting from the point z = 0 at time t = 0. Let τ denote the hitting time of the unit circle. For every holomorphic function F in the unit disk,       f  =   ∑    c  k    h  k      ,      f       subscript  c  k    subscript  h  k       f=\sum c_{k}h_{k},     is a martingale, that belongs to martingale- H p iff F ∈ H p .  Example: dyadic martingale- H 1  In this example, Ω = [0, 1] and Σ n is the finite field generated by the dyadic partition of [0, 1] into 2 n intervals of length 2 − n , for every n ≥ 0. If a function f on [0, 1] is represented by its expansion on the Haar system ( h k )        ∫  0  1       (   ∑    |    c  k    h  k    (  x  )    |   2    )    1  2     d  x    .      superscript   subscript   0   1      superscript     superscript       subscript  c  k    subscript  h  k   x    2      1  2    normal-d  x     \int_{0}^{1}\Bigl(\sum|c_{k}h_{k}(x)|^{2}\Bigr)^{\frac{1}{2}}\,\mathrm{d}x.     then the martingale- H 1 norm of f can be defined by the L 1 norm of the square function  $$\int_0^1 \Bigl( \sum |c_k h_k(x)|^2 \Bigr)^{\frac{1}{2}} \, \mathrm{d}x.$$  This space, sometimes denoted by H 1 (δ), is isomorphic to the classical real H 1 space on the circle . The Haar system is an unconditional basis for H 1 (δ).  References                    "    Category:Operator theory
