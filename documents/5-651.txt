   Borel's lemma      Borel's lemma   In mathematics , Borel's lemma , named after Émile Borel , is an important result used in the theory of asymptotic expansions and partial differential equations .  Statement  Suppose U is an open set in the Euclidean space  R n , and suppose that f 0 , f 1 ... is a sequence of smooth  functions on U .  If I is an any open interval in R containing 0 (possibly I = R ), then there exists a smooth function F ( t , x ) defined on I × U , such that         (     ∂  k    ∂   t  k     F   )    (  0  ,  x  )    =    f  k    (  x  )     ,             superscript   k      superscript  t  k     F    0  x       subscript  f  k   x     \displaystyle{\left(\frac{\partial^{k}}{\partial t^{k}}F\right)(0,x)=f_{k}(x),}     for k ≥ 0 and x in U .  Proof  Proofs of Borel's lemma can be found in many text books on analysis, including  and , from which the proof below is taken.  Note that it suffices to prove the result for a small interval I = (−ε,ε), since if ψ( t ) is a smooth bump function with compact support in (−ε,ε) equal identically to 1 near 0, then ψ( t ) ⋅ F ( t , x ) gives a solution on R × U . Similarly using a smooth partition of unity on R n subordinate to a covering by open balls with centres at δ⋅ Z n , it can be assumed that all the f m have compact support in some fixed closed ball C . For each m , let         F  m    (  t  ,  x  )    =        t  m    m  !    ⋅  ψ    (   t   ε  m    )    ⋅   f  m     (  x  )     ,         subscript  F  m    t  x       normal-⋅     normal-⋅     superscript  t  m     m    ψ     t   subscript  ε  m      subscript  f  m    x     \displaystyle{F_{m}(t,x)={t^{m}\over m!}\cdot\psi\left({t\over\varepsilon_{m}}%
 \right)\cdot f_{m}(x),}     where ε m is chosen sufficiently small that        ∥    ∂  α    F  m    ∥   ∞   ≤   2   -  m         subscript   norm    superscript   α    subscript  F  m        superscript  2    m      \displaystyle{\|\partial^{\alpha}F_{m}\|_{\infty}\leq 2^{-m}}     for |α| \displaystyle{\sum_{m\ge 0} \partial^\alpha F_m}  is uniformly convergent and hence that      F  =    ∑   m  ≥  0     F  m        F    subscript     m  0     subscript  F  m      \displaystyle{F=\sum_{m\geq 0}F_{m}}     is a smooth function with         ∂  α   F   =    ∑   m  ≥  0      ∂  α    F  m      .        superscript   α   F     subscript     m  0      superscript   α    subscript  F  m       \displaystyle{\partial^{\alpha}F=\sum_{m\geq 0}\partial^{\alpha}F_{m}.}     By construction            ∂  t  m   F    (  t  ,  x  )    |    t  =  0    =    f  m    (  x  )     .       evaluated-at      superscript   subscript   t   m   F    t  x      t  0       subscript  f  m   x     \displaystyle{\partial_{t}^{m}F(t,x)|_{t=0}=f_{m}(x).}     Note: Exactly the same construction can be applied, without the auxiliary space U , to produce a smooth function on the interval I for which the derivatives at 0 form an arbitrary sequence.
