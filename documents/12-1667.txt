   Knudsen layer      Knudsen layer   The Knudsen layer , also known as evaporation layer, is the thin layer of vapor near a liquid or solid. It is named after Danish physicist Martin Knudsen (1871–1949).  Definition  This region, several mean free path lengths thick, is called the Knudsen layer. 1  Knudsen layer thickness  The knudsen layer thickness can be approximated by    l  c     subscript  l  c    l_{c}   , given by 2      l  c   =    k   T  s     π   d  2    p  s          subscript  l  c       k   subscript  T  s      π   superscript  d  2    subscript  p  s       l_{c}=\frac{kT_{s}}{\pi d^{2}p_{s}}   ,  where   k   k   k   is Boltzmann's constant ,    T  s     subscript  T  s    T_{s}   is the temperature,   d   d   d   is the molecular diameter and    p  s     subscript  p  s    p_{s}   is the pressure.  Applications  One of the applications of Knudsen layer is in the coma of comets. It has been used specially in the coma chemistry model (ComChem model). 3  References  "  Category:Fluid dynamics     ↩  ↩  ↩
