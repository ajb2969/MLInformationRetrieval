   Weakly measurable function      Weakly measurable function   In mathematics — specifically, in functional analysis — a weakly measurable function taking values in a Banach space is a function whose composition with any element of the dual space is a measurable function in the usual (strong) sense. For separable spaces , the notions of weak and strong measurability agree.  Definition  If ( X , Σ) is a measurable space and B is a Banach space over a field  K (usually the real numbers  R or complex numbers  C ), then f : X → B is said to be weakly measurable if, for every continuous linear functional  g : B → K , the function       g  ∘  f   :   X  →  𝐊   :   x  ↦   g   (   f   (  x  )    )          normal-:    g  f    normal-→  X  𝐊     normal-:     maps-to  x    g    f  x        g\circ f\colon X\to\mathbf{K}\colon x\mapsto g(f(x))     is a measurable function with respect to Σ and the usual Borel σ -algebra on K .  Properties  The relationship between measurability and weak measurability is given by the following result, known as Pettis ' theorem or Pettis measurability theorem .   A function f is said to be almost surely separably valued (or essentially separably valued ) if there exists a subset N ⊆ X with μ ( N ) = 0 such that f ( X \ N ) ⊆ B is separable.    Theorem (Pettis) . A function f : X → B defined on a measure space ( X , Σ, μ ) and taking values in a Banach space B is (strongly) measurable (with respect to Σ and the Borel σ -algebra on B ) if and only if it is both weakly measurable and almost surely separably valued.   In the case that B is separable, since any subset of a separable Banach space is itself separable, one can take N above to be empty, and it follows that the notions of weak and strong measurability agree when B is separable.
