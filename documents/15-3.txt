Motor constants

The constants KM (motor size constant) and ' Kv' (motor velocity constant, or back EMF constant) are values used to describe characteristics of electrical motors.
Motor constant
KM is the motor constant1 (sometimes, motor size constant, or torque constant), defined as:



where



 
  is the motor torque (SI units, N·m)


 
  is the resistive power loss (SI units, W)

The motor constant is winding independent (as long as the same conductive material used for wires); e.g., winding a motor with 6 turns with 2 parallel wires instead of 12 turns single wire will double the velocity constant, Kv, but KM remains unchanged. KM can be used for selecting the size of a motor to use in an application. Kv can be used for selecting the winding to use in the motor.
Motor velocity constant, back EMF constant
Kv is the motor velocity constant, measured in RPM per volt (not to be confused with kV, the abbreviation for kilovolt).2 The Kv rating of a brushless motor is the ratio of the motor's unloaded RPM to the peak (not RMS) voltage on the wires connected to the coils (the back-EMF). For example, an unloaded motor of Kv, 5,700 RPM/V, supplied with 11.1 V, will run at a nominal 63,270 RPM (5,700 RPM/V × 11.1 V).
The terms Ke,3 Kb are also used,4 as are the terms back emf constant.56 or the generic electrical constant.7
The field flux may also be integrated into the formula:8

Eb = KωΦω
 
Where Eb is back emf, Kω is the constant, Φ is the flux, and ω is the angular speed


An inverse measure is also sometimes used, which may be referred to as the speed constant.9
By Lenz's law, a running motor generates a back-EMF proportional to the RPM. Once the motor's rotational velocity is such that the back-EMF is equal to the battery voltage (also called DC line voltage), the motor reaches its limit speed.
