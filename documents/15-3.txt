   Motor constants      Motor constants   The constants K M (motor size constant) and ' K v ' (motor velocity constant, or back EMF constant) are values used to describe characteristics of electrical motors.  Motor constant  K M is the motor constant 1 (sometimes, motor size constant , or torque constant ), defined as:      τ   P       τ    P     \frac{\tau}{\sqrt{P}}     where      τ   τ   \scriptstyle\tau   is the motor torque (SI units, N·m)     P   P   \scriptstyle P   is the resistive power loss (SI units, W)   The motor constant is winding independent (as long as the same conductive material used for wires); e.g., winding a motor with 6 turns with 2 parallel wires instead of 12 turns single wire will double the velocity constant, K v , but K M remains unchanged. K M can be used for selecting the size of a motor to use in an application. K v can be used for selecting the winding to use in the motor.  Motor velocity constant, back EMF constant  K v is the motor velocity constant, measured in RPM per volt (not to be confused with kV , the abbreviation for kilovolt ). 2 The K v rating of a brushless motor is the ratio of the motor's unloaded RPM to the peak (not RMS) voltage on the wires connected to the coils (the back-EMF ). For example, an unloaded motor of K v , 5,700 RPM/V, supplied with 11.1 V, will run at a nominal 63,270 RPM (5,700 RPM/V × 11.1 V).  The terms K e , 3  K b are also used, 4 as are the terms back emf constant . 5 6 or the generic electrical constant . 7  The field flux may also be integrated into the formula: 8   E b = K ω Φω  Where E b is back emf, K ω is the constant, Φ is the flux, and ω is the angular speed    An inverse measure is also sometimes used, which may be referred to as the speed constant. 9  By Lenz's law , a running motor generates a back-EMF proportional to the RPM. Once the motor's rotational velocity is such that the back-EMF is equal to the battery voltage (also called DC line voltage), the motor reaches its limit speed.
