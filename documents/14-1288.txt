Kmetija

Kmetija ("The Farm") is a Slovene reality show based on the Swedish franchise Farmen by Strix. Four series have been completed in Slovenia, and there are no plans for more.
Format
Twelve contestants, six female and six male, live on a farm similar to those from a century ago. There is no running water, bathroom, or internet during the ten-week filming of the show. One contestant is eliminated each week until only one remains; this contestant wins a 50,000 EUR cash grand prize. Every week one contestant is Farm Leader. He chose two servants, one male and one female. Between these two servants, the other contestants chose a first duelist. The first duelist chooses a second dualist and the second dualist chooses a type of duel. There are three possible types of duel: tug of wars, saw or knowledge. If housemates are of different genders, the only duel possible is knowledge. The loser of the duel is eliminated, and he or she writes a letter announcing next week's HOH.
Cast
The first two series were presented by Špela Močnik, the celebrity series was presented by Anja Križnik Tomažin and the fourth season will be presented by Lilly Žagar.

Špela Močnik was presenter of the first two seasons of Kmetija. Before she presented Kmetija, she was a radio presenter on the most listened radio station in Slovenia, Radio Hit. She presented Hitova Budilka (Hit's Wakeup Call), the morning show from 6 to 10 A.M.

The fourth season of Kmetija will be presented by Lili Žagar. She previously presented Svet na Kanalu A (eng.: World on Channel A) daily news.


  In every season is a Farm Master who gives contestants tasks to complete.

Marijan Podobnik was Farm Master in the first two seasons, as well as in Week 1 and half of Week 2 of the celebrity edition. He died in Week 2 of Kmetija Slavnih.
Vencelj Tušar replaced Marijan Podobnik in week 3 of Kmetija Slavnih. There was no formal announcement whether he will return for the fourth season of Kmetija after 2 years absence.
