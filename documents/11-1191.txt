   2-Hydroxyacylsphingosine 1-beta-galactosyltransferase      2-Hydroxyacylsphingosine 1-beta-galactosyltransferase   In enzymology , a 2-hydroxyacylsphingosine 1-beta-galactosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-galactose + 2-(2-hydroxyacyl)sphingosine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 1-(beta-D-galactosyl)-2-(2-hydroxyacyl)sphingosine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-galactose and 2-(2-hydroxyacyl)sphingosine , whereas its two products are UDP and 1-(beta-D-galactosyl)-2-(2-hydroxyacyl)sphingosine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-galactose:2-(2-hydroxyacyl)sphingosine 1-beta-D-galactosyl-transferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphogalactose-2-hydroxyacylsphingosine , galactosyltransferase , UDPgalactose-2-hydroxyacylsphingosine galactosyltransferase , UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase , and UDP-galactose:2-2-hydroxyacylsphingosine galactosyltransferase .
