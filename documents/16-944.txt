   Twisted polynomial ring      Twisted polynomial ring   In mathematics , a twisted polynomial is a polynomial over a field of characteristic    p   p   p   in the variable   τ   τ   \tau   representing the Frobenius map    x  ↦   x  p      maps-to  x   superscript  x  p     x\mapsto x^{p}   . In contrast to normal polynomials, multiplication of these polynomials is not commutative , but satisfies the commutation rule       τ  x   =    x  p   τ         τ  x      superscript  x  p   τ     \tau x=x^{p}\tau   for all   x   x   x   .  Over an infinite field, the twisted polynomial ring is isomorphic to the ring of additive polynomials , but where multiplication on the latter is given by composition rather than usual multiplication. However, it is often easier to compute in the twisted polynomial ring — this can be applied especially in the theory of Drinfeld modules .  Definition  Let   k   k   k   be a field of characteristic   p   p   p   . The twisted polynomial ring    k   {  τ  }       k   τ     k\{\tau\}   is defined as the set of polynomials in the variable   τ   τ   \tau   and coefficients in   k   k   k   . It is endowed with a ring structure with the usual addition, but with a non-commutative multiplication that can be summarized with the relation     τ  x   =    x  p   τ         τ  x      superscript  x  p   τ     \tau x=x^{p}\tau   . Repeated application of this relation yields a formula for the multiplication of any two twisted polynomials.  As an example we perform such a multiplication        (   a  +   b  τ    )    (   c  +   d  τ    )    =    a   (   c  +   d  τ    )    +   b  τ   (   c  +   d  τ    )     =    a  c   +   a  d  τ   +   b   c  p   τ   +   b   d  p    τ  2               a    b  τ      c    d  τ         a    c    d  τ       b  τ    c    d  τ               a  c     a  d  τ     b   superscript  c  p   τ     b   superscript  d  p    superscript  τ  2        (a+b\tau)(c+d\tau)=a(c+d\tau)+b\tau(c+d\tau)=ac+ad\tau+bc^{p}\tau+bd^{p}\tau^{2}     Properties  The morphism        k   {  τ  }    →   k   [  x  ]     ,     a  0   +    a  1   τ   +  ⋯  +    a  n    τ  n     ↦     a  0   x   +    a  1    x  p    +  ⋯  +    a  n    x   p  n          formulae-sequence   normal-→    k   τ      k   delimited-[]  x      maps-to     subscript  a  0      subscript  a  1   τ   normal-⋯     subscript  a  n    superscript  τ  n          subscript  a  0   x      subscript  a  1    superscript  x  p    normal-⋯     subscript  a  n    superscript  x   superscript  p  n         k\{\tau\}\to k[x],\quad a_{0}+a_{1}\tau+\cdots+a_{n}\tau^{n}\mapsto a_{0}x+a_{%
 1}x^{p}+\cdots+a_{n}x^{p^{n}}   defines a ring homomorphism sending a twisted polynomial to an additive polynomial. Here, multiplication on the right hand side is given by composition of polynomials. For example         (    a  x   +   b   x  p     )   ∘   (    c  x   +   d   x  p     )    =    a   (    c  x   +   d   x  p     )    +   b    (    c  x   +   d   x  p     )   p     =    a  c  x   +   a  d   x  p    +   b   c  p    x  p    +   b   d  p    x   p  2       ,              a  x     b   superscript  x  p         c  x     d   superscript  x  p          a      c  x     d   superscript  x  p        b   superscript      c  x     d   superscript  x  p     p              a  c  x     a  d   superscript  x  p      b   superscript  c  p    superscript  x  p      b   superscript  d  p    superscript  x   superscript  p  2         (ax+bx^{p})\circ(cx+dx^{p})=a(cx+dx^{p})+b(cx+dx^{p})^{p}=acx+adx^{p}+bc^{p}x^%
 {p}+bd^{p}x^{p^{2}},   using the fact that in characteristic   p   p   p   we have the Freshman's dream       (   x  +  y   )   p   =    x  p   +   y  p         superscript    x  y   p      superscript  x  p    superscript  y  p      (x+y)^{p}=x^{p}+y^{p}   .  The homomorphism is clearly injective, but is surjective if and only if   k   k   k   is infinite. The failure of surjectivity when   k   k   k   is finite is due to the existence of non-zero polynomials which induce the zero function on   k   k   k   (e.g.     x  q   -  x       superscript  x  q   x    x^{q}-x   over the finite field with   q   q   q   elements).  Even though this ring is not commutative, it still possesses (left and right) division algorithms .  References      "  Category:Algebraic number theory  Category:Finite fields
