   Crotonyl-CoA reductase      Crotonyl-CoA reductase   Crotonyl-CoA reductase (, butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase , butyryl dehydrogenase , unsaturated acyl-CoA reductase , ethylene reductase , enoyl-coenzyme A reductase , unsaturated acyl coenzyme A reductase , butyryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase , short-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase , short-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase , 3-hydroxyacyl CoA reductase , butanoyl-CoA:(acceptor) 2,3-oxidoreductase , CCR ) is an enzyme with system name butanoyl-CoA:NADP + 2,3-oxidoreductase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   butanoyl-CoA + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (E)-but-2-enoyl-CoA + NADPH + H +    This enzyme catalyses the reaction in the reverse direction.
