   5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole synthase      5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole synthase   5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole synthase (, BluB ) is an enzyme with system name FMNH 2 oxidoreductase (5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole forming) . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   FMNH 2 + NADH + H + + O 2  $\rightleftharpoons$  5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole + D-erythrose 4-phosphate + NAD + + other product   The C-2 of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole is derived from C-1' of the ribityl group of FMNH 2 and 2-H from the ribityl 1'-pro-S hydrogen.
