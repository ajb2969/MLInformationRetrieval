5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole synthase

5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole synthase (, BluB) is an enzyme with system name FMNH2 oxidoreductase (5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole forming).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

FMNH2 + NADH + H+ + O2 $\rightleftharpoons$ 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole + D-erythrose 4-phosphate + NAD+ + other product
 

The C-2 of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole is derived from C-1' of the ribityl group of FMNH2 and 2-H from the ribityl 1'-pro-S hydrogen.
