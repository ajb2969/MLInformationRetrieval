Malmquist's theorem

In mathematics, Malmquist's theorem, introduced by , is a theorem restricting the differential equations that have meromorphic solutions.
Statement
Malmquist's theorem states that if w is a meromorphic function with infinitely many poles satisfying the complex differential equation


 
  where R(z,w) is a rational function, then as a function of w, R is a polynomial of degree 2; in other words the differential equation is a Riccati equation.
