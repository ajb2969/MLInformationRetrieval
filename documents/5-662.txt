   Wirtinger's inequality for functions      Wirtinger's inequality for functions    For other inequalities named after Wirtinger, see Wirtinger's inequality .    In mathematics , historically Wirtinger's inequality for real functions was an inequality used in Fourier analysis . It was named after Wilhelm Wirtinger . It was used in 1904 to prove the isoperimetric inequality . A variety of closely related results are today known as Wirtinger's inequality.  Theorem  First version  Let $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a periodic function of period 2π, which is continuous and has a continuous derivative throughout R , and such that  $$\int_0^{2\pi}f(x) \, dx = 0.$$  Then  $$\int_0^{2\pi}f'^2(x) \, dx \ge \int_0^{2\pi}f^2(x) \, dx$$  with equality if and only if  f ( x ) = a sin( x ) + b cos( x ) for some a and b (or equivalently f ( x ) = c sin ( x + d ) for some c and d ).  This version of the Wirtinger inequality is the one-dimensional Poincaré inequality , with optimal constant.  Second version  The following related inequality is also called Wirtinger's inequality :  $$\pi^{2}\int_0^a |f|^2 \le a^2 \int_0^a|f'|^2$$  whenever f is a C 1 function such that f (0) = f ( a ) = 0. In this form, Wirtinger's inequality is seen as the one-dimensional version of Friedrichs' inequality .  Proof  The proof of the two versions are similar. Here is a proof of the first version of the inequality. Since Dirichlet's conditions are met, we can write  $$f(x)=\frac{1}{2}a_0+\sum_{n\ge 1}\left(a_n\frac{\sin nx}{\sqrt{\pi}}+b_n\frac{\cos nx}{\sqrt{\pi}}\right),$$  and moreover a 0 = 0 since the integral of f vanishes. By Parseval's identity ,  $$\int_0^{2\pi}f^2(x)dx=\sum_{n=1}^\infty(a_n^2+b_n^2)$$  and  $$\int_0^{2\pi}f'^2(x) \, dx = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n^2(a_n^2+b_n^2)$$  and since the summands are all ≥ 0, we get the desired inequality, with equality if and only if a n = b n = 0 for all n ≥ 2.
