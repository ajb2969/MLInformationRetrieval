   Gerstenhaber algebra      Gerstenhaber algebra   In mathematics and theoretical physics , a Gerstenhaber algebra (sometimes called an antibracket algebra or braid algebra ) is an algebraic structure discovered by Murray Gerstenhaber (1963) that combines the structures of a supercommutative ring and a graded Lie superalgebra . It is used in the Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism .  Definition  A Gerstenhaber algebra is a graded commutative algebra with a Lie bracket of degree -1 satisfying the Poisson identity . Everything is understood to satisfy the usual superalgebra sign conventions. More precisely, the algebra has two products, one written as ordinary multiplication and one written as [,], and a Z -grading called degree (in theoretical physics sometimes called ghost number ). The degree of an element a is denoted by | a |. These satisfy the identities   | ab | = | a | + | b | (The product has degree 0)  |[ a , b ]| = | a | + | b | - 1 (The Lie bracket has degree -1)  ( ab ) c = a ( bc ) (The product is associative)  ab = (−1) | a || b | ba (The product is (super) commutative)  [ a , bc ] = [ a , b ] c + (−1) (| a |-1)| b | b [ a , c ] (Poisson identity)  [ a , b ] = −(−1) (| a |-1)(| b |-1) [ b , a ] (Antisymmetry of Lie bracket)  [ a ,[ b , c ]] = [[ a , b ], c ] + (−1) (| a |-1)(| b |-1) [ b ,[ a , c ]] (The Jacobi identity for the Lie bracket)   Gerstenhaber algebras differ from Poisson superalgebras in that the Lie bracket has degree -1 rather than degree 0. The Jacobi identity may also be expressed in a symmetrical form          (   -  1   )     (    |  a  |   -  1   )    (    |  c  |   -  1   )      [  a  ,   [  b  ,  c  ]   ]    +     (   -  1   )     (    |  b  |   -  1   )    (    |  a  |   -  1   )      [  b  ,   [  c  ,  a  ]   ]    +     (   -  1   )     (    |  c  |   -  1   )    (    |  b  |   -  1   )      [  c  ,   [  a  ,  b  ]   ]     =   0.            superscript    1         a   1       c   1      a   b  c        superscript    1         b   1       a   1      b   c  a        superscript    1         c   1       b   1      c   a  b      0.

A Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra has an underlying Gerstenhaber algebra if one forgets its second order Δ operator.  The exterior algebra of a Lie algebra is a Gerstenhaber algebra.  The differential forms on a Poisson manifold form a Gerstenhaber algebra.  The multivector fields on a manifold form a Gerstenhaber algebra using the Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket   References       "  Category:Algebras  Category:Theoretical physics  Category:Symplectic geometry
