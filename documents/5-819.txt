Lidstone series

In mathematics, a Lidstone series, named after George James Lidstone, is a kind of polynomial expansion that can expressed certain types of entire functions.
Let ƒ(z) be an entire function of exponential type less than (N + 1)π, as defined below. Then ƒ(z) can be expanded in terms of polynomials An as follows:



Here An(z) is a polynomial in z of degree n, Ck a constant, and ƒ(n)(a) the nth derivative of ƒ at a.
A function is said to be of exponential type of less than t if the function



is bounded above by t. Thus, the constant N used in the summation above is given by



with
