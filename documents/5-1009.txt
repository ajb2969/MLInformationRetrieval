   Hyperbolic manifold      Hyperbolic manifold   In mathematics , a hyperbolic manifold is a space where every point looks locally like hyperbolic space of some dimension. They are especially studied in dimensions 2 and 3, where they are called hyperbolic surfaces and hyperbolic 3-manifolds , respectively. In these dimensions, they are important because most manifolds can be made into a hyperbolic manifold by a homeomorphism . This is a consequence of the uniformization theorem for surfaces and the geometrization theorem for 3-manifolds proved by Perelman.

Each half of this shape is a hyperbolic 2-manifold (i.e. surface) with boundary.   Rigorous Definition  A hyperbolic   n   n   n   -manifold is a complete Riemannian n-manifold of constant sectional curvature -1.  Every complete, connected, simply-connected manifold of constant negative curvature −1 is isometric to the real hyperbolic space    ℍ  n     superscript  ℍ  n    \mathbb{H}^{n}   . As a result, the universal cover of any closed manifold M of constant negative curvature −1 is    ℍ  n     superscript  ℍ  n    \mathbb{H}^{n}   . Thus, every such M can be written as     ℍ  n   /  Γ       superscript  ℍ  n   normal-Γ    \mathbb{H}^{n}/\Gamma   where Γ is a torsion-free discrete group of isometries on    ℍ  n     superscript  ℍ  n    \mathbb{H}^{n}   . That is, Γ is a discrete subgroup of    S   O   1  ,  n   +   ℝ      S   subscript   superscript  O     1  n    ℝ    SO^{+}_{1,n}\mathbb{R}   . The manifold has finite volume if and only if Γ is a lattice.  Its thick-thin decomposition has a thin part consisting of tubular neighborhoods of closed geodesics and ends which are the product of a Euclidean n-1 -manifold and the closed half-ray. The manifold is of finite volume if and only if its thick part is compact.  For n>2 the hyperbolic structure on a finite volume hyperbolic n -manifold is unique by Mostow rigidity and so geometric invariants are in fact topological invariants.
