   Algebraic expression      Algebraic expression   In mathematics , an algebraic expression is an expression built up from integer constants , variables , and the algebraic operations ( addition , subtraction , multiplication , division and exponentiation by an exponent that is a rational number ). 1 For example,      3   x  2    -   2  x  y    +  c          3   superscript  x  2      2  x  y    c    3x^{2}-2xy+c   is an algebraic expression. Since taking the square root is the same as raising to the power    1  2      1  2    \tfrac{1}{2}   ,        1  -   x  2     1  +   x  2             1   superscript  x  2      1   superscript  x  2       \sqrt{\frac{1-x^{2}}{1+x^{2}}}   is also an algebraic expression. By contrast, transcendental numbers like π and e are not algebraic.  A rational expression is an expression that may be rewritten to a rational fraction by using the properties of the arithmetic operations ( commutative properties and associative properties of addition and multiplication, distributive property and rules for the operations on the fractions). In other words, a rational expression is an expression which may be constructed from the variables and the constants by using only the four operations of arithmetic . Thus,       3   x  2    -   2  x  y    +  c     y  3   -  1             3   superscript  x  2      2  x  y    c      superscript  y  3   1     \frac{3x^{2}-2xy+c}{y^{3}-1}   is a rational expression, whereas      1  -   x  2     1  +   x  2             1   superscript  x  2      1   superscript  x  2       \sqrt{\frac{1-x^{2}}{1+x^{2}}}   is not.  A rational equation is an equation in which two rational fractions (or rational expressions) of the form     P   (  x  )     Q   (  x  )          P  x     Q  x     \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}   are set equal to each other. These expressions obey the same rules as fractions . The equations can be solved by cross-multiplying . Division by zero is undefined, so that a solution causing formal division by zero is rejected.  Terminology  Algebra has its own terminology to describe parts of an expression:   1 – Exponent (power), 2 – coefficient, 3 – term, 4 – operator, 5 – constant,    x  ,  y     x  y    x,y   - variables   In roots of polynomials  The roots of a polynomial expression of degree  n , or equivalently the solutions of a polynomial equation , can always be written as algebraic expressions if n \ge 5.  Conventions  Variables  By convention, letters at the beginning of the alphabet (e.g.    a  ,  b  ,  c     a  b  c    a,b,c   ) are typically used to represent constants , and those toward the end of the alphabet (e.g.    x  ,  y     x  y    x,y   and   z   z   z   ) are used to represent variables . 2 They are usually written in italics. 3  Exponents  By convention, terms with the highest power ( exponent ), are written on the left, for example,    x  2     superscript  x  2    x^{2}   is written to the left of   x   x   x   . When a coefficient is one, it is usually omitted (e.g.    1   x  2       1   superscript  x  2     1x^{2}   is written    x  2     superscript  x  2    x^{2}   ). 4 Likewise when the exponent (power) is one, (e.g.    3   x  1       3   superscript  x  1     3x^{1}   is written    3  x      3  x    3x   ), 5 and, when the exponent is zero, the result is always 1 (e.g.    3   x  0       3   superscript  x  0     3x^{0}   is written   3   3   3   , since    x  0     superscript  x  0    x^{0}   is always   1   1   1   ). 6  Algebraic vs. other mathematical expressions  The table below summarizes how algebraic expressions compare with several other types of mathematical expressions.  A rational algebraic expression (or rational expression ) is an algebraic expression that can be written as a quotient of polynomials , such as . An irrational algebraic expression is one that is not rational, such as      3   x  2    -   2  x  y    +  c          3   superscript  x  2      2  x  y    c    3x^{2}-2xy+c   .
