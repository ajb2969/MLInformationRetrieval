   Great ellipse      Great ellipse   right|150px|thumb|A spheroid  A great ellipse is an ellipse passing through two points on a spheroid and having the same center as that of the spheroid. Equivalently, it is an ellipse on the surface of spheroid and centered at the origin , or the curve formed by intersecting the spheroid by a plane through its center. 1 For points which are separated by less than about a quarter of the circumference of the earth, about     10 000   km      10 000  km    10\,000\,\mathrm{km}   , the length of the great ellipse connecting the points is close (within one part in 500,000) to the geodesic distance . 2 3 4 The great ellipse therefore is sometimes proposed as a suitable route for marine navigation.  Introduction  Assume that the spheroid, an ellipsoid of revolution, has an equatorial radius   a   a   a   and polar semi-axis   b   b   b   . Define the flattening    f  =    (   a  -  b   )   /  a       f      a  b   a     f=(a-b)/a   , the eccentricity    e  =    f   (   2  -  f   )         e      f    2  f       e=\sqrt{f(2-f)}   , and the second eccentricity     e  ′   =   e  /   (   1  -  f   )         superscript  e  normal-′     e    1  f      e^{\prime}=e/(1-f)   . Consider two points   A   A   A   at (geographic) latitude    ϕ  1     subscript  ϕ  1    \phi_{1}   and longitude    λ  1     subscript  λ  1    \lambda_{1}   and   B   B   B   at latitude    ϕ  2     subscript  ϕ  2    \phi_{2}   and longitude    λ  2     subscript  λ  2    \lambda_{2}   . The connecting great ellipse (from   A   A   A   to   B   B   B   ) has length    s  12     subscript  s  12    s_{12}   and has azimuths     α  1     subscript  α  1    \alpha_{1}   and    α  2     subscript  α  2    \alpha_{2}   at the two endpoints.  There are various ways to map an ellipsoid into a sphere of radius   a   a   a   in such a way as to map the great ellipse into a great circle, allowing the methods of great-circle navigation to be used:   The ellipsoid can be stretched in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation; this maps a point of latitude   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   on the ellipsoid to a point on the sphere with latitude   β   β   \beta   , the parametric latitude .  A point on the ellipsoid can mapped radially onto the sphere along the line connecting it with the center of the ellipsoid; this maps a point of latitude   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   on the ellipsoid to a point on the sphere with latitude   θ   θ   \theta   , the geocentric latitude .  The ellipsoid can be stretched into a prolate ellipsoid with polar semi-axis     a  2   /  b       superscript  a  2   b    a^{2}/b   and then mapped radially onto the sphere; this preserves the latitude—the latitude on the sphere is   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   , the geographic latitude .   The last method gives an easy way to generate a succession of way-points on the great ellipse connecting two known points   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   . Solve for the great circle between    (   ϕ  1   ,   λ  1   )      subscript  ϕ  1    subscript  λ  1     (\phi_{1},\lambda_{1})   and    (   ϕ  2   ,   λ  2   )      subscript  ϕ  2    subscript  λ  2     (\phi_{2},\lambda_{2})   and find the way-points on the great circle . These map into way-points on the corresponding great ellipse.  Mapping the great ellipse to a great circle  If distances and headings are needed, it is simplest to use the first of the mappings. 5 In detail, the mapping is as follows (this description is taken from 6 ):   The geographic latitude   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   on the ellipsoid maps to the parametric latitude   β   β   \beta   on the sphere, where        a   tan  β    =   b   tan  ϕ     .        a    β      b    ϕ      a\tan\beta=b\tan\phi.      The longitude   λ   λ   \lambda   is unchanged.   * The azimuth   α   α   \alpha   on the ellipsoid maps to an azimuth   γ   γ   \gamma   on the sphere where          tan  α        =     tan  γ     1  -    e  2     cos  2   β         ,        tan  γ        =     tan  α     1  +    e   ′  2      cos  2   ϕ         ,           α     absent      γ       1     superscript  e  2     superscript   2   β            γ     absent      α       1     superscript  e   normal-′  2      superscript   2   ϕ           \begin{aligned}\displaystyle\tan\alpha&\displaystyle=\frac{\tan\gamma}{\sqrt{1%
 -e^{2}\cos^{2}\beta}},\\
 \displaystyle\tan\gamma&\displaystyle=\frac{\tan\alpha}{\sqrt{1+e^{\prime 2}%
 \cos^{2}\phi}},\end{aligned}      and the quadrants of   α   α   \alpha   and   γ   γ   \gamma   are the same.   Positions on the great circle of radius   a   a   a   are parametrized by arc length   σ   σ   \sigma   measured from the northward crossing of the equator. The great ellipse has a semi-axes   a   a   a   and    a    1  -    e  2     cos  2    γ  0           a      1     superscript  e  2     superscript   2    subscript  γ  0         a\sqrt{1-e^{2}\cos^{2}\gamma_{0}}   , where    γ  0     subscript  γ  0    \gamma_{0}   is the great-circle azimuth at the northward equator crossing, and   σ   σ   \sigma   is the parametric angle on the ellipse.   (A similar mapping to an auxiliary sphere is carried out in the solution of geodesics on an ellipsoid . The differences are that the azimuth   α   α   \alpha   is conserved in the mapping, while the longtitude   λ   λ   \lambda   maps to a "spherical" longitude   ω   ω   \omega   . The equivalent ellipse used for distance calculations has semi-axes    b    1  +    e   ′  2      cos  2    α  0           b      1     superscript  e   normal-′  2      superscript   2    subscript  α  0         b\sqrt{1+e^{\prime 2}\cos^{2}\alpha_{0}}   and   b   b   b   .)  Solving the inverse problem  The "inverse problem" is the determination of    s  12     subscript  s  12    s_{12}   ,    α  1     subscript  α  1    \alpha_{1}   , and    α  2     subscript  α  2    \alpha_{2}   , given the positions of   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   . This is solved by computing    β  1     subscript  β  1    \beta_{1}   and    β  2     subscript  β  2    \beta_{2}   and solving for the great-circle between    (   β  1   ,   λ  1   )      subscript  β  1    subscript  λ  1     (\beta_{1},\lambda_{1})   and    (   β  2   ,   λ  2   )      subscript  β  2    subscript  λ  2     (\beta_{2},\lambda_{2})   .  The spherical azimuths are relabeled as   γ   γ   \gamma   (from   α   α   \alpha   ). Thus    γ  0     subscript  γ  0    \gamma_{0}   ,    γ  1     subscript  γ  1    \gamma_{1}   , and    γ  2     subscript  γ  2    \gamma_{2}   and the spherical azimuths at the equator and at   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   . The azimuths of the endpoints of great ellipse,    α  1     subscript  α  1    \alpha_{1}   and    α  2     subscript  α  2    \alpha_{2}   , are computed from    γ  1     subscript  γ  1    \gamma_{1}   and    γ  2     subscript  γ  2    \gamma_{2}   .  The semi-axes of the great ellipse can be found using the value of    γ  0     subscript  γ  0    \gamma_{0}   .  Also determined as part of the solution of the great circle problem are the arc lengths,    σ  01     subscript  σ  01    \sigma_{01}   and    σ  02     subscript  σ  02    \sigma_{02}   , measured from the equator crossing to   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   . The distance    s  12     subscript  s  12    s_{12}   is found by computing the length of a portion of perimeter of the ellipse using the formula giving the meridian arc in terms the parametric latitude . In applying this formula, use the semi-axes for the great ellipse (instead of for the meridian) and substitute    σ  01     subscript  σ  01    \sigma_{01}   and    σ  02     subscript  σ  02    \sigma_{02}   for   β   β   \beta   .  The solution of the "direct problem", determining the position of   B   B   B   given   A   A   A   ,    α  1     subscript  α  1    \alpha_{1}   , and    s  12     subscript  s  12    s_{12}   , can be similarly be found (this requires, in addition, the inverse meridian distance formula ). This also enables way-points (e.g., a series of equally spaced intermediate points) to be found in the solution of the inverse problem.
