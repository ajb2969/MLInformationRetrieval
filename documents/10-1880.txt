A great ellipse is an ellipse passing through two points on a spheroid and having the same center as that of the spheroid. Equivalently, it is an ellipse on the surface of spheroid and centered at the origin, or the curve formed by intersecting the spheroid by a plane through its center.1 For points which are separated by less than about a quarter of the circumference of the earth, about 
 
 
 
 , the length of the great ellipse connecting the points is close (within one part in 500,000) to the geodesic distance.234 The great ellipse therefore is sometimes proposed as a suitable route for marine navigation.
Introduction
Assume that the spheroid, an ellipsoid of revolution, has an equatorial radius 
 
 
 
  and polar semi-axis 
 
 
 
 . Define the flattening 
 
 
 
 , the eccentricity 
 
 
 
 , and the second eccentricity 
 
 
 
 . Consider two points
 
 
 
  at (geographic) latitude 
 
 
 
  and longitude 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  at latitude 
 
 
 
  and longitude 
 
 
 
 . The connecting great ellipse (from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 ) has length 
 
 
 
  and has azimuths

 
  and 
 
 
 
  at the two endpoints.
There are various ways to map an ellipsoid into a sphere of radius 
 
 
 
  in such a way as to map the great ellipse into a great circle, allowing the methods of great-circle navigation to be used:

The ellipsoid can be stretched in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation; this maps a point of latitude 
 
 
 
  on the ellipsoid to a point on the sphere with latitude 
 
 
 
 , the parametric latitude.
A point on the ellipsoid can mapped radially onto the sphere along the line connecting it with the center of the ellipsoid; this maps a point of latitude 
 
 
 
  on the ellipsoid to a point on the sphere with latitude 
 
 
 
 , the geocentric latitude.
The ellipsoid can be stretched into a prolate ellipsoid with polar semi-axis 
 
 
 
  and then mapped radially onto the sphere; this preserves the latitudeâ€”the latitude on the sphere is 
 
 
 
 , the geographic latitude.

The last method gives an easy way to generate a succession of way-points on the great ellipse connecting two known points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Solve for the great circle between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and find the way-points on the great circle. These map into way-points on the corresponding great ellipse.
Mapping the great ellipse to a great circle
If distances and headings are needed, it is simplest to use the first of the mappings.5 In detail, the mapping is as follows (this description is taken from 6):

The geographic latitude 
 
 
 
  on the ellipsoid maps to the parametric latitude 
 
 
 
  on the sphere, where
 




The longitude 
 
 
 
  is unchanged.

* The azimuth 
 
 
 
  on the ellipsoid maps to an azimuth 
 
 
 
  on the sphere where





and the quadrants of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are the same.

Positions on the great circle of radius 
 
 
 
  are parametrized by arc length 
 
 
 
  measured from the northward crossing of the equator. The great ellipse has a semi-axes 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  is the great-circle azimuth at the northward equator crossing, and 
 
 
 
  is the parametric angle on the ellipse.

(A similar mapping to an auxiliary sphere is carried out in the solution of geodesics on an ellipsoid. The differences are that the azimuth 
 
 
 
  is conserved in the mapping, while the longtitude 
 
 
 
  maps to a "spherical" longitude 
 
 
 
 . The equivalent ellipse used for distance calculations has semi-axes 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .)
Solving the inverse problem
The "inverse problem" is the determination of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , given the positions of 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . This is solved by computing 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and solving for the great-circle between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 .
The spherical azimuths are relabeled as 
 
 
 
  (from 
 
 
 
 ). Thus 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 
  and the spherical azimuths at the equator and at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The azimuths of the endpoints of great ellipse, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , are computed from 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The semi-axes of the great ellipse can be found using the value of 
 
 
 
 .
Also determined as part of the solution of the great circle problem are the arc lengths, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , measured from the equator crossing to 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The distance 
 
 
 
  is found by computing the length of a portion of perimeter of the ellipse using the formula giving the meridian arc in terms the parametric latitude. In applying this formula, use the semi-axes for the great ellipse (instead of for the meridian) and substitute 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 
 .
The solution of the "direct problem", determining the position of 
 
 
 
  given 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , can be similarly be found (this requires, in addition, the inverse meridian distance formula). This also enables way-points (e.g., a series of equally spaced intermediate points) to be found in the solution of the inverse problem.
