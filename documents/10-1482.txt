Glycine dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a glycine dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

glycine + H2O + NAD+

 
  glyoxylate + NH3 + NADH + H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are glycine, H2O, and NAD+, whereas its 4 products are glyoxylate, NH3, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycine:NAD+ oxidoreductase (deaminating).
This should not be confused with:
the glycine dehydrogenase (decarboxylating), which is another name for the Glycine cleavage system P-protein ().
or the glycine dehydroganse (cyanide forming)().
or the glycine dehydrogenase (cytochrome) ().
