Infinite expression (mathematics)

In mathematics, an infinite expression is an expression in which some operators take an infinite number of arguments, or in which the nesting of the operators continues to an infinite depth.1 A generic concept for infinite expression can lead to ill-defined or self-inconsistent constructions (much like a set of all sets), but there are several instances of infinite expressions that are well defined.
Examples of well-defined infinite expressions include23 infinite sums, whether expressed using summation notation or as an infinite series, such as


infinite products, whether expressed using product notation or expanded, such as


infinite nested radicals, such as


infinite power towers, such as


 
  and infinite continued fractions, whether expressed using Gauss's Kettenbruch notation or expanded, such as



In infinitary logic, one can use infinite conjunctions and infinite disjunctions.
Even for well-defined infinite expressions, the value of the infinite expression may be ambiguous or not well defined; for instance, there are multiple summation rules available for assigning values to series, and the same series may have different values according to different summation rules if the series is not absolutely convergent.
From the hyperreal viewpoint
From the point of view of the hyperreals, such an infinite expression 
 
 
 
  is obtained in every case from the sequence 
 
 
 
  of finite expressions, by evaluating the sequence at a hypernatural value 
 
 
 
  of the index n, and applying the standard part, so that
