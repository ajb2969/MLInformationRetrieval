   Infinite expression (mathematics)      Infinite expression (mathematics)   In mathematics , an infinite expression is an expression in which some operators take an infinite number of arguments, or in which the nesting of the operators continues to an infinite depth. 1 A generic concept for infinite expression can lead to ill-defined or self-inconsistent constructions (much like a set of all sets ), but there are several instances of infinite expressions that are well defined.  Examples of well-defined infinite expressions include 2 3 infinite sums, whether expressed using summation notation or as an infinite series , such as         ∑   n  =  0   ∞    a  n    =    a  0   +   a  1   +   a  2   +   ⋯     ;        superscript   subscript     n  0       subscript  a  n       subscript  a  0    subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-⋯     \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}=a_{0}+a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots\,;    infinite products , whether expressed using product notation or expanded, such as        ∏   n  =  0   ∞    b  n    =    b  0   ×   b  1   ×   b  2   ×   ⋯          superscript   subscript  product    n  0       subscript  b  n       subscript  b  0    subscript  b  1    subscript  b  2   normal-⋯     \prod_{n=0}^{\infty}b_{n}=b_{0}\times b_{1}\times b_{2}\times\cdots\,    infinite nested radicals , such as        1  +   2    1  +   3    1  +  ⋯                1    2      1    3      1  normal-⋯           \sqrt{1+2\sqrt{1+3\sqrt{1+\cdots}}}\,    infinite power towers , such as        2     2     2    ⋅   ⋅  ⋅          superscript    2    superscript    2    superscript    2    superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  normal-⋅  normal-⋅        \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot}}}}}\,   and infinite continued fractions , whether expressed using Gauss 's Kettenbruch notation or expanded, such as        c  0   +     K   n  =  1   ∞     1   c  n      =    c  0   +    1    c  1   +    1    c  2   +    1    c  3   +    1    c  4   +  ⋱                      subscript  c  0        n  1    infinity  normal-K      1   subscript  c  n         subscript  c  0    continued-fraction  1     subscript  c  1    continued-fraction  1     subscript  c  2    continued-fraction  1     subscript  c  3    continued-fraction  1     subscript  c  4   normal-⋱             c_{0}+\underset{n=1}{\overset{\infty}{\mathrm{K}}}\,\frac{1}{c_{n}}=c_{0}+%
 \cfrac{1}{c_{1}+\cfrac{1}{c_{2}+\cfrac{1}{c_{3}+\cfrac{1}{c_{4}+\ddots}}}}\,     In infinitary logic , one can use infinite conjunctions and infinite disjunctions.  Even for well-defined infinite expressions, the value of the infinite expression may be ambiguous or not well defined; for instance, there are multiple summation rules available for assigning values to series, and the same series may have different values according to different summation rules if the series is not absolutely convergent .  From the hyperreal viewpoint  From the point of view of the hyperreals, such an infinite expression    E  ∞     subscript  E     E_{\infty}   is obtained in every case from the sequence    ⟨    E  n   :   n  ∈  ℕ    ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   normal-:   subscript  E  n     n  ℕ      \langle E_{n}:n\in\mathbb{N}\rangle   of finite expressions, by evaluating the sequence at a hypernatural value    n  =  H      n  H    n=H   of the index n , and applying the standard part , so that     E  ∞   =   st   (   E  H   )         subscript  E      st   subscript  E  H      E_{\infty}=\text{st}(E_{H})   .
