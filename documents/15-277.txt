   Augmented-fourths tuning      Augmented-fourths tuning     Among alternative  tunings for guitar , each augmented-fourths tuning is a regular tuning in which the musical intervals between successive open-string  notes are each augmented fourths . 1 Because augmented fourths are alternatively called " tritones " ("tri-tones") or " diminished fifths ", augmented-fourths tuning is also called tritone tuning or diminished-fifths tuning .  The standard guitar-tuning   E-A-d-g-b'-e'   interjects exactly one major third amid four perfect fourths for the intervals between its successive open strings . In contrast, the augmented fourths tunings   C-F-c-f-c'-f ' and  B-F-b-f-b'-f'   have only augmented-fourths intervals.  The set of augmented-fourths tunings has three properties that simplify learning by beginners and improvisation by experts: Regular intervals, string repetition , and lefty-righty symmetry. These properties characterize augmented-fourths tunings among non-trivial tunings.  Properties  (Figure)  In modern music, the twelve notes of the octave are equally space around the chromatic circle . On this circle, there are six pairs of antipodal notes, each representing an augmented-fourth interval. Each such pair specifies the successive open-strings of an augmented-fourths tuning.   The set of augmented-fourths tunings has three properties that simplify learning by beginners and improvisation by experts: Regular intervals, string repetition, and lefty-righty symmetry. 2  Besides the set of augmented-fourths tuning, exactly one other set of tunings has these three properties—the trivial class of one-note tunings, which contains the C-C-C-C-C-C tuning, for example. 3  Augmented-fourths tunings have extended range . Because each of its tritone-intervals between successive strings is wider than the perfect-fourth intervals (and one major third) of standard tuning, augmented-fourths tunings have greater range than standard tuning—six additional notes, only one less note than Robert Fripp 's new standard tuning .  Regular intervals  In each regular tuning , the musical intervals are the same for each pair of consecutive strings. Other regular tunings include major-thirds , all-fourths , and all-fifths tunings . For each regular tuning, chord patterns may be moved around the fretboard, a property that simplifies beginners' learning of chords and that simplifies advanced players' improvisation . 4 5  Thrice repeated open-string notes  Two other regular tunings, all-fourths and all-fifths tunings, have strings with five and six distinct open-notes, respectively. Thus, they have no repetition of open-notes, and so they require that the guitarist remember five and six strings, respectively. 6  In contrast, augmented fourths is a repetitive tuning that begins the next octave after two strings. 7 These tunings' repetition of open-string notes again simplifies the learning of chords and improvisation. 8  Left-handed involution  For left-handed guitars , the ordering of the strings reverse the ordering of right-handed guitars. Consequently, left-handed tunings have different chords than right-handed tunings. Regular guitar-tunings have the property that their left-handed ("lefty" versions) are also regular tunings. For example, the left-handed version of all-fourths tuning is all-fifths tuning , and the left-handed version of all-fifths tuning is all-fourths tuning. In general, the left-handed involute of the regular tuning based on the interval with   n   n   n    semitones is the regular tuning based on its involuted interval with    12  -  n      12  n    12-n   semitones: All-fourths tuning is based on the perfect fourth (five semitones), and all-fifths tuning is based on the perfect fifth (seven semitones), as mentioned previously. 9  The left-handed involute of an augmented-fourth tuning is the augmented-fourths tuning with the same open-string notes. 10 "The augmented-fourth interval is the only interval whose inverse is the same as itself. The augmented-fourths tuning is the only tuning (other than the 'trivial' tuning C-C-C-C-C-C) for which all chords-forms remain unchanged when the strings are reversed. Thus the augmented-fourths tuning is its own 'lefty' tuning." 11  Examples  The " standard tuning " consists of perfect fourths and a single major-third between the G (g) and B (b') strings: 12   E-A-d-g-b'-e'   C-F-C-F-C-F  Of all the augmented-fourths tunings, the C-F-c-f-c'-f ' tuning is the closest approximation to the standard tuning, 13 and its fretboard is displayed next:      }} 14         1st string     2nd string     3rd string     4th string     5th string     6th string     Each fret displays the open strings of exactly one augmented-fourths tuning.  B-F-B-F-B-F  There are no sharps in the open strings of exactly one augmented-fourths tuning, that with only B and F notes (B-F-b-f-b'-f'). This tuning would appear, for the C-F augmented-fourths tuning displayed above, to the left of the open strings, at the negative -first fret.      align="center" Augmented-fourths B-F tuning        1st string     2nd string     3rd string     4th string     5th string     6th string     This tuning "makes it very easy for playing half-whole scales, diminished 7 licks, and whole tone scales," stated guitarist Ron Jarzombek , who has used it on two albums. 15 This tuning was used in " Tri 7/5 " by Shawn Lane ( The Tri-Tone Fascination and Powers of Ten; Live! ).
