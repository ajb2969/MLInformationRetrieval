There are two degrees of trunctions, including a bitruncation .

Each vertex is surrounded by 3 truncated tetrahedra and one tetrahedron; the vertex figure is an elongated tetrahedron.  Construction  The truncated 5-cell may be constructed from the 5-cell by truncating its vertices at 1/3 the edge length. This truncates the 5 tetrahedral cells into truncated tetrahedra, and introduces 5 new tetrahedral cells positioned on the original vertices.  Structure  The truncated tetrahedra are joined to each other at their hexagonal faces, and to the tetrahedra at their triangular faces.  Projections  The tetrahedron-first parallel projection of the truncated 5-cell into 3-dimensional space has the following structure:   The projection envelope is a truncated tetrahedron .  One of the truncated tetrahedral cells project onto the entire envelope.  One of the tetrahedral cells project onto a tetrahedron lying at the center of the envelope.  Four flattened tetrahedra are joined to the triangular faces of the envelope, and connected to the central tetrahedron via 4 radial edges. These are the images of the remaining 4 tetrahedral cells.  Between the central tetrahedron and the 4 hexagonal faces of the envelope are 4 irregular truncated tetrahedral volumes, which are the images of the 4 remaining trucated tetrahedral cells.   This layout of cells in projection is analogous to the layout of faces in the face-first projection of the truncated tetrahedron into 2-dimensional space. The truncated 5-cell is the 4-dimensional analogue of the truncated tetrahedron.

Each hexagonal face of the truncated tetrahedra is joined in complementary orientation to the neighboring truncated tetrahedron. Each edge is shared by two hexagons and one triangle. Each vertex is surrounded by 4 truncated tetrahedral cells in a tetragonal disphenoid  vertex figure .  The bitruncated 5-cell is the intersection of two pentachora in dual configuration. As such, it is also the intersection of a penteract with the hyperplane that bisects the penteract's long diagonal orthogonally. In this sense it is a 4-dimensional analog of the regular octahedron (intersection of regular tetrahedra in dual configuration / tesseract bisection on long diagonal) and the regular hexagon (equilateral triangles / cube). The 5-dimensional analog is the birectified 5-simplex , and the   n   n   n   -dimensional analog is the polytope whose Coxeter–Dynkin diagram is linear with rings on the middle one or two nodes.  The bitruncated 5-cell is one of the two non-regular uniform 4-polytopes which are cell-transitive . The other is the bitruncated 24-cell , which is composed of 48 truncated cubes.  Symmetry  This 4-polytope has a higher extended pentachoric symmetry (2×A 4 , [[3,3,3]]), doubled to order 240, because the element corresponding to any element of the underlying 5-cell can be exchanged with one of those corresponding to an element of its dual.

These represent positive orthant facets of the bitruncated pentacross .  Another 5-space construction are all 20 permutations of (1,0,0,0,-1).  Related polytopes  Related regular skew polyhedron  The regular skew polyhedron , {6,4|3}, exists in 4-space with 4 hexagonal around each vertex, in a zig-zagging nonplanar vertex figure. These hexagonal faces can be seen on the bitruncated 5-cell, using all 60 edges and 20 vertices. The 20 triangular faces of the bitruncated 5-cell can be seen as removed. The dual regular skew polyhedron, {4,6|3}, is similarly related to the square faces of the runcinated 5-cell . {{-}}  Related polytopes  These polytope are from a set of 9 uniform 4-polytope constructed from the [3,3,3] Coxeter group .
