   Stieltjes transformation      Stieltjes transformation   In mathematics, the Stieltjes transformation  S ρ ( z ) of a measure of density ρ on a real interval I is the function of the complex variable z defined outside I by the formula          S  ρ    (  z  )    =    ∫  I     ρ   (  t  )   d  t    z  -  t      ,   t  ∈  I  ⊂  ℝ    ,   z  ∈   ℂ  \  ℝ       formulae-sequence   formulae-sequence       subscript  S  ρ   z     subscript   I       ρ  t  d  t     z  t          t  I       ℝ       z   normal-\  ℂ  ℝ      S_{\rho}(z)=\int_{I}\frac{\rho(t)\,dt}{z-t},\qquad t\in I\subset\mathbb{R},\;z%
 \in\mathbb{C}\backslash\mathbb{R}     Under certain conditions we can reconstitute the density function ρ starting from its Stieltjes transformation thanks to the inverse formula of Stieltjes-Perron. For example, if the density ρ is continuous throughout I , one will have inside this interval        ρ   (  x  )    =    lim   ε  →   0  +         S  ρ    (   x  -   i  ε    )    -    S  ρ    (   x  +   i  ε    )      2  i  π      .        ρ  x       normal-→  ε   superscript  0     lim          subscript  S  ρ     x    i  ε        subscript  S  ρ     x    i  ε        2  i  π       \rho(x)=\underset{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^{+}}{\text{lim}}\frac{S_{\rho}(x-i%
 \varepsilon)-S_{\rho}(x+i\varepsilon)}{2i\pi}.     Connections with moments of measures  If the measure of density ρ has moments of any order defined for each integer by the equality        m  n   =    ∫  I      t  n    ρ   (  t  )   d  t     ,       subscript  m  n     subscript   I      superscript  t  n   ρ  t  d  t      m_{n}=\int_{I}t^{n}\,\rho(t)\,dt,     then the Stieltjes transformation of ρ admits for each integer n the asymptotic expansion in the neighbourhood of infinity given by         S  ρ    (  z  )    =     ∑   k  =  0   n     m  k    z   k  +  1      +   o   (   1   z   n  +  1     )      .         subscript  S  ρ   z       superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  m  k    superscript  z    k  1        o    1   superscript  z    n  1         S_{\rho}(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{m_{k}}{z^{k+1}}+o\left(\frac{1}{z^{n+1}}\right).     Under certain conditions the complete expansion as a Laurent series can be obtained:         S  ρ    (  z  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     m  n    z   n  +  1       .         subscript  S  ρ   z     superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  m  n    superscript  z    n  1        S_{\rho}(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{m_{n}}{z^{n+1}}.     Relationships to orthogonal polynomials  The correspondence     (  f  ,  g  )   ↦    ∫  I    f   (  t  )   g   (  t  )   ρ   (  t  )   d  t       maps-to   f  g     subscript   I     f  t  g  t  ρ  t  d  t      (f,g)\mapsto\int_{I}f(t)g(t)\rho(t)\,dt   defines an inner product on the space of continuous functions on the interval I .  If { P n } is a sequence of orthogonal polynomials for this product, we can create the sequence of associated secondary polynomials by the formula         Q  n    (  x  )    =    ∫  I        P  n    (  t  )    -    P  n    (  x  )      t  -  x    ρ   (  t  )   d  t     .         subscript  Q  n   x     subscript   I            subscript  P  n   t      subscript  P  n   x      t  x    ρ  t  d  t      Q_{n}(x)=\int_{I}\frac{P_{n}(t)-P_{n}(x)}{t-x}\rho(t)\,dt.     It appears that      F  n    (  z  )    =     Q  n    (  z  )      P  n    (  z  )            subscript  F  n   z        subscript  Q  n   z      subscript  P  n   z      F_{n}(z)=\frac{Q_{n}(z)}{P_{n}(z)}   is a Padé approximation of S ρ ( z ) in a neighbourhood of infinity, in the sense that          S  ρ    (  z  )    -     Q  n    (  z  )      P  n    (  z  )      =   O   (   1   z   2  n     )     .           subscript  S  ρ   z        subscript  Q  n   z      subscript  P  n   z       O    1   superscript  z    2  n        S_{\rho}(z)-\frac{Q_{n}(z)}{P_{n}(z)}=O\left(\frac{1}{z^{2n}}\right).     Since these two sequences of polynomials satisfy the same recurrence relation in three terms, we can develop a continued fraction for the Stieltjes transformation whose successive convergents are the fractions F n ( z ).  The Stieltjes transformation can also be used to construct from the density ρ an effective measure for transforming the secondary polynomials into an orthogonal system.
