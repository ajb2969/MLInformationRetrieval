Compound Poisson process

A compound Poisson process is a continuous-time (random) stochastic process with jumps. The jumps arrive randomly according to a Poisson process and the size of the jumps is also random, with a specified probability distribution. A compound Poisson process, parameterised by a rate 
 
 
 
  and jump size distribution G, is a process 
 
 
 
  given by



where, 
 
 
 
 
  is a Poisson process with rate 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are independent and identically distributed random variables, with distribution function G, which are also independent of 
 
 

When 
 
 
 
  are non-negative integer-valued random variable, then this compound Poisson process is named stuttering Poisson process which has the feature that two or more events occur in a very short time .
Properties of the compound Poisson process
Using conditional expectation, the expected value of a compound Poisson process can be calculated using a result known as Wald's equation as:



Making similar use of the law of total variance, the variance can be calculated as:



Lastly, using the law of total probability, the moment generating function can be given as follows:






Exponentiation of measures
Let N, Y, and D be as above. Let μ be the probability measure according to which D is distributed, i.e.



Let δ0 be the trivial probability distribution putting all of the mass at zero. Then the probability distribution of Y(t) is the measure



where the exponential exp(ν) of a finite measure ν on Borel subsets of the real line is defined by



and



is a convolution of measures, and the series converges weakly.
Fitting a compound Poisson process
The parameters for independent observations of a compound Poisson process can be chosen using a maximum likelihood estimator using Simar's algorithm,1 which has been shown to converge.2
