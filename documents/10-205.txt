   NAD+ kinase      NAD+ kinase     NAD + kinase (EC 2.7.1.23, NADK) is an enzyme that converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) into NADP + , through phosphorylating the NAD +  coenzyme . 1 NADP + is an essential coenzyme in metabolism and provides reducing power to biosynthetic processes such as fatty acid biosynthesis . 2 The structure of the NADK from the archaean  Archaeoglobus fulgidus has been determined. 3  In humans, NAD + kinase is encoded by the NADK  gene . 4  Reaction  ATP + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    ADP + NADP +  See also   Oxidative phosphorylation  Electron transport chain  Metabolism   References  Further reading  External links   ENZYME entry on EC 2.7.1.23  BRENDA entry on EC 2.7.1.23   "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Cellular respiration  Category:Metabolism  Category:Human proteins     ↩  ↩   ↩
