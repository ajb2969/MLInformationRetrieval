   Phot      Phot   A phot ( ph ) is a photometric unit of illuminance , or luminous flux through an area. It is not an SI unit, but rather is associated with the older centimetre gram second system of units . The name was coined by André Blondel in 1921. 1  Metric equivalence:         1   phot   =    1    lumen   centimeter  2     =  10   ,      000    lumens   meter  2     =  10   ,     000   lux   =    10   kilolux        formulae-sequence        1  phot     1    lumen   superscript  centimeter  2          10     formulae-sequence      000    lumens   superscript  meter  2     10       000  lux     10  kilolux       1\ \mathrm{phot}=1\ \frac{\mathrm{lumen}}{\mathrm{centimeter}^{2}}=10,000\ %
