Unicoherent space

In mathematics, a unicoherent space is a topological space

 
  that is  connected and in which the following property holds:
For any closed, connected 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , the intersection 
 
 
 
 
  is connected.
For example, any closed interval on the real line is unicoherent, but a circle is not.
If a unicoherent space is more strongly hereditarily unicoherent (meaning that every subcontinuum is unicoherent) and arcwise connected, then it is called a dendroid. If in addition it is locally connected then it is called a dendrite. The Phragmen–Brouwer theorem states that, for locally connected spaces, unicoherence is equivalent to a separation property of the closed sets of the space.
