   Unicoherent space      Unicoherent space   In mathematics, a unicoherent space is a topological space    X   X   X   that is connected and in which the following property holds:  For any closed, connected     A  ,  B   ⊂  X       A  B   X    A,B\subset X   with    X  =   A  ∪  B       X    A  B     X=A\cup B   , the intersection    A  ∩  B      A  B    A\cap B   is connected.  For example, any closed interval on the real line is unicoherent, but a circle is not.  If a unicoherent space is more strongly hereditarily unicoherent (meaning that every subcontinuum is unicoherent) and arcwise connected , then it is called a dendroid . If in addition it is locally connected then it is called a dendrite . The Phragmen–Brouwer theorem states that, for locally connected spaces, unicoherence is equivalent to a separation property of the closed sets of the space.
