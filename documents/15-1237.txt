21S rRNA (uridine2791-2'-O)-methyltransferase

21S rRNA (uridine2791-2'-O)-methyltransferase (, MRM2 (gene), mitochondrial 21S rRNA methyltransferase, mitochondrial rRNA MTase 2) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:21S rRNA (uridine2791-2'-O-)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + uridine2791 in 21S rRNA 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methyluridine2791 in 21S rRNA
 

The enzyme catalyses the methylation of uridine2791 of mitochondrial 21S rRNA.
