   21S rRNA (uridine2791-2'-O)-methyltransferase      21S rRNA (uridine2791-2'-O)-methyltransferase   21S rRNA (uridine 2791 -2'-O)-methyltransferase (, MRM2 (gene) , mitochondrial 21S rRNA methyltransferase , mitochondrial rRNA MTase 2 ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:21S rRNA (uridine 2791 -2'-O-)-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + uridine 279 1 in 21S rRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methyluridine 2791 in 21S rRNA   The enzyme catalyses the methylation of uridine 2791 of mitochondrial  21S rRNA .
