   Szemer√©di‚ÄìTrotter theorem      Szemer√©di‚ÄìTrotter theorem   The Szemer√©di‚ÄìTrotter theorem is a mathematical result in the field of combinatorial geometry . It asserts that given   n   n   n   points and   m   m   m   lines in the plane, the number of incidences (i.e. the number of point-line pairs, such that the point lies on the line) is       O   (     n   2  3     m   2  3     +  n  +  m   )    ,      O       superscript  n    2  3     superscript  m    2  3     n  m     O\left(n^{\frac{2}{3}}m^{\frac{2}{3}}+n+m\right),     this bound cannot be improved, except in terms of the implicit constants.  An equivalent formulation of the theorem is the following. Given   n   n   n   points and an integer    k  >  2      k  2    k>2   , the number of lines which pass through at least   k   k   k   of the points is       O   (     n  2    k  3    +   n  k    )    .      O       superscript  n  2    superscript  k  3      n  k      O\left(\frac{n^{2}}{k^{3}}+\frac{n}{k}\right).     The original proof of Szemer√©di and Trotter 1 was somewhat complicated, using a combinatorial technique known as cell decomposition . Later, Sz√©kely discovered a much simpler proof using the crossing number inequality for graphs . 2 (See below.)  The Szemer√©di‚ÄìTrotter theorem has a number of consequences, including Beck's theorem in incidence geometry .  Proof of the first formulation  We may discard the lines which contain two or fewer of the points, as they can contribute at most    2  m      2  m    2m   incidences to the total number. Thus we may assume that every line contains at least three of the points.  If a line contains   k   k   k   points, then it will contain    k  ‚àí  1      k  normal-‚àí  1    k‚àí1   line segments which connect two of the   n   n   n   points. In particular it will contain at least k /2 such line segments, since we have assumed    k  ‚â•  3      k  normal-‚â•  3    k‚â•3   . Adding this up over all of the   m   m   m   lines, we see that the number of line segments obtained in this manner is at least half of the total number of incidences. Thus if we let   e   e   e   be the number of such line segments, it will suffice to show that       e  =   O   (     n   2  3     m   2  3     +  n  +  m   )     .      e    O       superscript  n    2  3     superscript  m    2  3     n  m      e=O\left(n^{\frac{2}{3}}m^{\frac{2}{3}}+n+m\right).     Now consider the graph formed by using the   n   n   n   points as vertices, and the e line segments as edges. Since all of the line segments lie on one of   m   m   m   lines, and any two lines intersect in at most one point, the crossing number of this graph is at most . Applying the crossing number inequality we thus conclude that either    e  ‚â§  7.5  n      e  normal-‚â§  7.5  n    e‚â§7.5n   , or that . In either case and we obtain the desired bound       e  =   O   (     n   2  3     m   2  3     +  n  +  m   )     .      e    O       superscript  n    2  3     superscript  m    2  3     n  m      e=O\left(n^{\frac{2}{3}}m^{\frac{2}{3}}+n+m\right).     Proof of the second formulation  Since every pair of points can be connected by at most one line, there can be at most     n   (   n  ‚àí  1   )    /  2        n    n  normal-‚àí  1    2    n(n‚àí1)/2   lines which can connect at   k   k   k   or more points, since    k  ‚â•  2      k  normal-‚â•  2    k‚â•2   . This bound will prove the theorem when   k   k   k   is small (e.g. if    k  ‚â§  C      k  normal-‚â§  C    k‚â§C   for some absolute constant   C   C   C   ). Thus, we need only consider the case when   k   k   k   is large, say    k  ‚â•  C      k  normal-‚â•  C    k‚â•C   .  Suppose that there are m lines that each contain at least   k   k   k   points. These lines generate at least    m  k      m  k    mk   incidences, and so by the first formulation of the Szemer√©di‚ÄìTrotter theorem, we have        m  k   =   O   (     n   2  3     m   2  3     +  n  +  m   )     ,        m  k     O       superscript  n    2  3     superscript  m    2  3     n  m      mk=O\left(n^{\frac{2}{3}}m^{\frac{2}{3}}+n+m\right),     and so at least one of the statements      m  k   =   O   (    n   2  /  3     m   2  /  3     )     ,    m  k   =   O   (  n  )        formulae-sequence      m  k     O     superscript  n    2  3     superscript  m    2  3           m  k     O  n      mk=O(n^{2/3}m^{2/3}),mk=O(n)   , or     m  k   =   O   (  m  )          m  k     O  m     mk=O(m)   is true. The third possibility is ruled out since   k   k   k   was assumed to be large, so we are left with the first two. But in either of these two cases, some elementary algebra will give the bound    m  =   O   (     n  2   /   k  3    +   n  /  k    )        m    O       superscript  n  2    superscript  k  3      n  k       m=O(n^{2}/k^{3}+n/k)   as desired.  Optimality  Except for its constant, the Szemer√©di‚ÄìTrotter incidence bound cannot be improved. To see this, consider for any positive integer a set of points on the integer lattice       P  =   {    (  a  ,  b  )   ‚àà    ùêô  2     :    1  ‚â§  a  ‚â§  N   ;   1  ‚â§  b  ‚â§   2   N  2      }    ,      P   conditional-set     a  b    superscript  ùêô  2     formulae-sequence      1  a       N        1  b         2   superscript  N  2          P=\left\{(a,b)\in\mathbf{Z}^{2}\ :\ 1\leq a\leq N;1\leq b\leq 2N^{2}\right\},     and a set of lines       L  =   {   (  x  ,    m  x   +  b   )   :     m  ,  b   ‚àà  ùêô   ;   1  ‚â§  m  ‚â§  N   ;   1  ‚â§  b  ‚â§   N  2     }    .      L   conditional-set   x      m  x   b     formulae-sequence     m  b   ùêô       1  m       N        1  b        superscript  N  2         L=\left\{(x,mx+b)\ :\ m,b\in\mathbf{Z};1\leq m\leq N;1\leq b\leq N^{2}\right\}.     Clearly,     |  P  |   =   2   N  3          P     2   superscript  N  3      |P|=2N^{3}   and     |  L  |   =   N  3         L    superscript  N  3     |L|=N^{3}   . Since each line is incident to   N   N   N   points (i.e., once for each    x  ‚àà   {  1  ,  ‚ãØ  ,  N  }       x   1  normal-‚ãØ  N     x\in\{1,\cdots,N\}   ), the number of incidences is    N  4     superscript  N  4    N^{4}   which matches the upper bound. 3  Generalization to  One generalization of this result to arbitrary dimension, , was found by Agarwal and Aronov. 4 Given a set of   n   n   n   points,   S   S   S   , and the set of   m   m   m   hyperplanes,   H   H   H   , which are each spanned by   S   S   S   , the number of incidences between   S   S   S   and   H   H   H   is bounded above by       O   (     m   2  3     n   d  3     +   n   d  -  1     )    .      O       superscript  m    2  3     superscript  n    d  3      superscript  n    d  1       O\left(m^{\frac{2}{3}}n^{\frac{d}{3}}+n^{d-1}\right).     Equivalently, the number of hyperplanes in   H   H   H   containing   k   k   k   or more points is bounded above by       O   (     n  d    k  3    +    n   d  -  1    k    )    .      O       superscript  n  d    superscript  k  3       superscript  n    d  1    k      O\left(\frac{n^{d}}{k^{3}}+\frac{n^{d-1}}{k}\right).     A construction due to Edelsbrunner shows this bound to be asymptotically optimal. 5  Solymosi and Tao obtained near sharp upper bounds for the number of incidences between points and algebraic varieties in higher dimensions. Their proof uses the Polynomial Ham Sandwich Theorem . 6  References  "  Category:Euclidean plane geometry  Category:Theorems in discrete geometry  Category:Theorems in combinatorics  Category:Articles containing proofs     ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©
