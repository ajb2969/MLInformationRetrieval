Signal-to-noise statistic

In mathematics the signal-to-noise statistic distance between two vectors a and b with mean values 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and standard deviation

 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively is:



In the case of Gaussian-distributed data and unbiased class distributions, this statistic can be related to classification accuracy given an ideal linear discrimination, and a decision boundary can be derived.1
This distance is frequently used to identify vectors that have significant difference. One usage is in bioinformatics to locate genes that are differential expressed on microarray experiments.2
