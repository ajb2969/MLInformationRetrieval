   Signal-to-noise statistic      Signal-to-noise statistic   In mathematics the signal-to-noise statistic  distance between two vectors  a and b with mean values    μ  a     subscript  μ  a    \mu_{a}   and    μ  b     subscript  μ  b    \mu_{b}   and standard deviation     σ  a     subscript  σ  a    \sigma_{a}   and    σ  b     subscript  σ  b    \sigma_{b}   respectively is:       D   s  n    =    (    μ  a   -   μ  b    )    (    σ  a   +   σ  b    )         subscript  D    s  n         subscript  μ  a    subscript  μ  b       subscript  σ  a    subscript  σ  b       D_{sn}={(\mu_{a}-\mu_{b})\over(\sigma_{a}+\sigma_{b})}     In the case of Gaussian-distributed data and unbiased class distributions, this statistic can be related to classification accuracy given an ideal linear discrimination, and a decision boundary can be derived. 1  This distance is frequently used to identify vectors that have significant difference. One usage is in bioinformatics to locate genes that are differential expressed on microarray experiments. 2  See also   Distance  Uniform norm  Manhattan distance  Signal-to-noise ratio  Signal to noise ratio (imaging)   Notes  "  Category:Statistical distance measures  Category:Statistical ratios     Auffarth, B., Lopez, M., Cerquides, J.
