   Jitter (optics)      Jitter (optics)   In optics , jitter is used to refer to motion that has high temporal frequency relative to the integration/exposure time. This may result from vibration in an assembly or from the unstable hand of a photographer. Jitter is typically differentiated from smear , which has a lower frequency relative to the integration time. 1 Whereas smear refers to a relatively constant rate during the integration/exposure time, jitter refers to a relatively sinusoidal motion during the integration/exposure time.  The equation for the optical Modulation transfer function associated with jitter is       M  T   F   j  i  t  t  e  r     (  k  )    =   e   -    1  2    k  2    σ  2            M  T   subscript  F    j  i  t  t  e  r    k    superscript  e        1  2    superscript  k  2    superscript  σ  2        MTF_{jitter}(k)=e^{-\frac{1}{2}k^{2}\sigma^{2}}   where k is the spatial frequency and   σ   σ   \sigma   is the amplitude of the jitter. 2 Note that this frequency is in radians of phase per cycle. The equivalent expression in Hz is       M  T   F   j  i  t  t  e  r     (  u  )    =   e   -   2   π  2    u  2    σ  2            M  T   subscript  F    j  i  t  t  e  r    u    superscript  e      2   superscript  π  2    superscript  u  2    superscript  σ  2        MTF_{jitter}(u)=e^{-2\pi^{2}u^{2}\sigma^{2}}   where u is the spatial frequency and   σ   σ   \sigma   is again the amplitude of the jitter.  For spacecraft, operation in a vacuum often means low mechanical damping. Meanwhile, spacecraft are compact and rigid, to withstand high launch loads. Jitter, then, is transmitted easily and often a limiting factor for high-resolution optics.  References  "  Category:Photography  Category:Optics     ↩  ↩
