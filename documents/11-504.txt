   (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH))-phosphatase      (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH))-phosphatase   In enzymology , a [hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH)]-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   [hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH)] phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   [hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH)] + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH)  phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH) and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is [hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH)]-phosphate phosphohydrolase . This enzyme is also called reductase phosphatase .
