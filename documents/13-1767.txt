   Matsumoto zeta function      Matsumoto zeta function   In mathematics , Matsumoto zeta functions are a type of zeta function introduced by Kohji Matsumoto in 1990. They are functions of the form       ϕ   (  s  )    =    ∏  p    1    A  p    (   p   -  s    )            ϕ  s     subscript  product  p     1     subscript  A  p    superscript  p    s         \phi(s)=\prod_{p}\frac{1}{A_{p}(p^{-s})}   where p is a prime and A p is a polynomial .
