Protocatechuate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a protocatechuate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3,4-dihydroxybenzoate 
 
 
 
  catechol + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, and two products, catechol and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase (catechol-forming). Other names in common use include 3,4-dihydrobenzoate decarboxylase, and protocatechuate carboxy-lyase. This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation.
