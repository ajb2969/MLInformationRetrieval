   Orbital magnetization      Orbital magnetization   In quantum mechanics , orbital magnetization , M orb , refers to the magnetization induced by orbital motion of charged particles , usually electrons in solids . The term "orbital" distinguishes it from the contribution of spin degrees of freedom, M spin , to the total magnetization. A nonzero orbital magnetization requires broken time-reversal symmetry, which can occur spontaneously in ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials, or can be induced in a non-magnetic material by an applied magnetic field .  Definitions  The orbital magnetic moment of a finite system, such as a molecule, is given classically by 1       𝐦  orb   =    1  2    ∫      d  3    𝐫   𝐫   ×  𝐉    (  𝐫  )           subscript  𝐦  orb       1  2            superscript  d  3   𝐫  𝐫   𝐉   𝐫       \mathbf{m}_{\rm orb}=\frac{1}{2}\int d^{3}\mathbf{r}\,\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{%
 J}(\mathbf{r})   where J ( r ) is the current density at point r . (Here SI units are used; in Gaussian units , the prefactor would be 1/2 c instead, where c is the speed of light .) In a quantum-mechanical context, this can also be written as       𝐦  orb   =     -  e    2   m  e      ⟨  Ψ  |  𝐋  |  Ψ  ⟩         subscript  𝐦  orb         e     2   subscript  m  e      quantum-operator-product  normal-Ψ  𝐋  normal-Ψ      \mathbf{m}_{\rm orb}=\frac{-e}{2m_{e}}\langle\Psi|\mathbf{L}|\Psi\rangle   where − e and m e are the charge and mass of the electron , Ψ is the ground-state wave function , and L is the angular momentum operator. The total magnetic moment is      𝐦  =    𝐦  orb   +   𝐦  spin        𝐦     subscript  𝐦  orb    subscript  𝐦  spin      \mathbf{m}=\mathbf{m}_{\rm orb}+\mathbf{m}_{\rm spin}   where the spin contribution is intrinsically quantum-mechanical and is given by       𝐦  spin   =      -    g  s    μ  B     ℏ     ⟨  Ψ  |  𝐒  |  Ψ  ⟩         subscript  𝐦  spin            subscript  g  s    subscript  μ  normal-B     Planck-constant-over-2-pi    quantum-operator-product  normal-Ψ  𝐒  normal-Ψ      \mathbf{m}_{\rm spin}=\frac{-g_{s}\mu_{\rm B}}{\hbar}\,\langle\Psi|\mathbf{S}|\Psi\rangle   where g s is the electron spin g-factor , μ B is the Bohr magneton , ħ is the reduced Planck constant , and S is the electron spin operator .  The orbital magnetization M is defined as the orbital moment density i.e., orbital moment per unit volume. For a crystal of volume V composed of isolated entities (e.g., molecules) labelled by an index j having magnetic moments m orb, j , this is        𝐌  orb   =    1  V     ∑   j  ∈  V      𝐦   orb  ,  j        .       subscript  𝐌  orb       1  V     subscript     j  V     subscript  𝐦   orb  j        \mathbf{M}_{\rm orb}=\frac{1}{V}\sum_{j\in V}\mathbf{m}_{{\rm orb},j}\;.   However, real crystals are made up out of atomic or molecular constituents whose charge clouds overlap, so that the above formula cannot be taken as a fundamental definition of orbital magnetization. 2 Only recently have theoretical developments led to a proper theory of orbital magnetization in crystals, as explained below.  Theory  Difficulties in the definition of orbital magnetization  For a magnetic crystal, it is tempting to try to define       𝐌  orb   =    1   2  V      ∫  V       d  3    𝐫   𝐫   ×  𝐉    (  𝐫  )           subscript  𝐌  orb       1    2  V      subscript   V          superscript  d  3   𝐫  𝐫   𝐉   𝐫       \mathbf{M}_{\rm orb}=\frac{1}{2V}\int_{V}d^{3}\mathbf{r}\,\mathbf{r}\times%
 \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r})   where the limit is taken as the volume V of the system becomes large. However, because of the factor of r in the integrand, the integral has contributions from surface currents that cannot be neglected, and as a result the above equation does not lead to a bulk definition of orbital magnetization. 3  Another way to see that there is a difficulty is to try to write down the quantum-mechanical expression for the orbital magnetization in terms of the occupied single-particle Bloch functions  of band n and crystal momentum  k :        𝐌  orb   =     -  e    2   m  e       ∑  n     ∫  BZ        d  3   k     (   2  π   )   3      ⟨   ψ   n  𝐤    |   𝐫  ×  𝐩   |   ψ   n  𝐤    ⟩        ,       subscript  𝐌  orb         e     2   subscript  m  e       subscript   n     subscript   BZ          superscript  d  3   k    superscript    2  π   3     quantum-operator-product   subscript  ψ    n  𝐤      𝐫  𝐩    subscript  ψ    n  𝐤           \mathbf{M}_{\rm orb}=\frac{-e}{2m_{e}}\sum_{n}\int_{\rm BZ}\frac{d^{3}k}{(2\pi%
 )^{3}}\,\langle\psi_{n\mathbf{k}}|\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}|\psi_{n\mathbf{k}%
 }\rangle\,,   where p is the momentum operator , L = r × p , and the integral is evaluated over the Brillouin zone "BZ". However, because the Bloch functions are extended, the matrix element of a quantity containing the r operator is ill-defined, and this formula is actually ill-defined. 4  Atomic sphere approximation  In practice, orbital magnetization is often computed by decomposing space into non-overlapping spheres centered on atoms (similar in spirit to the muffin-tin approximation ), computing the integral of r × J ( r ) inside each sphere, and summing the contributions. 5 This approximation neglects the contributions from currents in the interstitial regions between the atomic spheres. Nevertheless, it is often a good approximation because the orbital currents associated with partially filled d and f shells are typically strongly localized inside these atomic spheres. It remains, however, an approximate approach.  Modern theory of orbital magnetization  A general and exact formulation of the theory of orbital magnetization was developed in the mid-2000s by several authors, first based on a semiclassical approach, 6 then on a derivation from the Wannier representation , 7 8 and finally from a long-wavelength expansion. 9 The resulting formula for the orbital magnetization, specialized to zero temperature, is        𝐌  orb   =    e   2  ℏ      ∑  n     ∫  BZ          d  3   k     (   2  π   )   3       f   n  𝐤      Im    ⟨    ∂   u   n  𝐤      ∂  𝐤    |    ×   (     H  𝐤   +   E   n  𝐤     -   2  μ    )     |    ∂   u   n  𝐤      ∂  𝐤    ⟩        ,       subscript  𝐌  orb       e    2  Planck-constant-over-2-pi      subscript   n     subscript   BZ              superscript  d  3   k    superscript    2  π   3     subscript  f    n  𝐤    Im   bra       subscript  u    n  𝐤       𝐤           subscript  H  𝐤    subscript  E    n  𝐤       2  μ      ket       subscript  u    n  𝐤       𝐤           \mathbf{M}_{\rm orb}=\frac{e}{2\hbar}\sum_{n}\int_{\rm BZ}\frac{d^{3}k}{(2\pi)%

A generalization to finite temperature is also available. 10 11 Note that the term involving the band energy E n  k in this formula is really just an integral of the band energy times the Berry curvature . Results computed using the above formula have appeared in the literature. 12 A recent review summarizes these developments. 13  Experiments  The orbital magnetization of a material can be determined accurately by measuring the gyromagnetic ratio  γ , i.e., the ratio between the magnetic dipole moment of a body and its angular momentum. The gyromagnetic ratio is related to the spin and orbital magnetization according to      γ  =   1  +    M  orb    (    M  spin   +   M  orb    )         γ    1     subscript  M  orb      subscript  M  spin    subscript  M  orb        \gamma=1+\frac{M_{\mathrm{orb}}}{(M_{\mathrm{spin}}+M_{\mathrm{orb}})}   The two main experimental techniques are based either on the Barnett effect or the Einstein–de Haas effect . Experimental data for Fe, Co, Ni, and their alloys have been compiled. 14  References    "  Category:Magnetism  Category:Electromagnetism  Category:Quantum mechanics  Category:Electronic structure methods     ↩  ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩    ↩  ↩  ↩
