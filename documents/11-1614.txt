Sulfate adenylyltransferase




Sulfate adenylyltransferase

In enzymology, a sulfate adenylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + sulfate 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + adenylyl sulfate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and sulfate, whereas its two products are diphosphate and adenylyl sulfate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:sulfate adenylyltransferase. Other names in common use include adenosine-5'-triphosphate sulfurylase, adenosinetriphosphate sulfurylase, adenylylsulfate pyrophosphorylase, ATP sulfurylase, ATP-sulfurylase, and sulfurylase. This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: purine metabolism, selenoamino acid metabolism, and sulfur metabolism.
Some sulfate adenylyltransferases are part of a bifunctional polypeptide chain associated with adenosyl phosphosulfate (APS) kinase. Both enzymes are required for PAPS (phosphoadenosine-phosphosulfate) synthesis from inorganic sulfate.12
