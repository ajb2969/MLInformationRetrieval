   Uridine kinase      Uridine kinase   In enzymology , an uridine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + uridine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + UMP   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and uridine , whereas its two products are ADP and UMP .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:uridine 5'-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include pyrimidine ribonucleoside kinase , uridine-cytidine kinase , uridine kinase (phosphorylating) , and uridine phosphokinase . This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 8 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , and .
