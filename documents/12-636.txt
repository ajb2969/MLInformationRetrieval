   Besicovitch covering theorem      Besicovitch covering theorem   In mathematical analysis , a Besicovitch cover , named after Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch , is an open cover of a subset E of the Euclidean space  R N by balls such that each point of E is the center of some ball in the cover.  The Besicovitch covering theorem asserts that there exists a constant c N depending only on the dimension N with the following property:   Given any Besicovitch cover F of a bounded set E , there are c N subcollections of balls A 1 = { B n 1 }, …, A c N = { B n c N } contained in F such that each collection A i consists of disjoint balls, and        E  ⊆    ⋃   i  =  1    c  N      ⋃   B  ∈   A  i     B     .      E    superscript   subscript     i  1     subscript  c  N      subscript     B   subscript  A  i     B      E\subseteq\bigcup_{i=1}^{c_{N}}\bigcup_{B\in A_{i}}B.     Let G denote the subcollection of F consisting of all balls from the c N disjoint families A 1 ,..., A c N . The less precise following statement is clearly true: every point x ∈ R N belongs to at most c N different balls from the subcollection G , and G remains a cover for E (every point y ∈ E  belongs to at least one ball from the subcollection G ). This property gives actually an equivalent form for the theorem (except for the value of the constant).   There exists a constant b N depending only on the dimension N with the following property: Given any Besicovitch cover F of a bounded set E , there is a subcollection G of F such that G is a cover of the set E and every point x ∈ R N belongs to at most b N different balls from the subcover G .   In other words, the function S G equal to the sum of the indicator functions of the balls in G is larger than 1 E and bounded on R N by the constant b N ,        𝟏  E   ≤   S  𝐆   :=    ∑   B  ∈  𝐆     𝟏  B    ≤   b  N    .         subscript  1  E    subscript  S  𝐆     assign      subscript     B  𝐆     subscript  1  B          subscript  b  N      \mathbf{1}_{E}\leq S_{\mathbf{G}}:=\sum_{B\in\mathbf{G}}\mathbf{1}_{B}\leq b_{%
 N}.     Application to maximal functions and maximal inequalities  Let μ be a Borel non-negative measure on R N , finite on compact subsets and let f be a μ-integrable function. Define the maximal function     f  *     superscript  f     f^{*}   by setting for every x (using the convention     ∞  ×  0   =  0         0   0    \infty\times 0=0   )         f  *    (  x  )    =    sup   r  >  0     (   μ    (   B   (  x  ,  r  )    )    -  1      ∫   B   (  x  ,  r  )       |   f   (  y  )    |   d  μ   (  y  )      )     .         superscript  f    x     subscript  supremum    r  0      μ   superscript    B   x  r      1      subscript     B   x  r           f  y    d  μ  y        f^{*}(x)=\sup_{r>0}\Bigl(\mu(B(x,r))^{-1}\int_{B(x,r)}|f(y)|\,d\mu(y)\Bigr).   This maximal function is upper semicontinuous , hence measurable . The following maximal inequality is satisfied for every λ > 0 :         λ   μ   (   {  x  :     f  *    (  x  )    >  λ   }   )    ≤     b  N     ∫    |  f  |   d  μ      .        λ  μ   conditional-set  x       superscript  f    x   λ        subscript  b  N         f   d  μ       \lambda\,\mu\bigl(\{x:f^{*}(x)>\lambda\}\bigr)\leq b_{N}\,\int|f|\,d\mu.      Proof.   The set E λ of the points x such that      f  *    (  x  )    >  λ         superscript  f    x   λ    f^{*}(x)>\lambda   clearly admits a Besicovitch cover F λ by balls B such that        ∫     𝟏  B     |  f  |   d  μ    =    ∫  B     |   f   (  y  )    |   d  μ   (  y  )     >    λ   μ   (  B  )     .             subscript  1  B     f   d  μ      subscript   B         f  y    d  μ  y           λ  μ  B      \int\mathbf{1}_{B}\,|f|\ d\mu=\int_{B}|f(y)|\,d\mu(y)>\lambda\,\mu(B).   For every bounded Borel subset E ´ of E λ , one can find a subcollection G extracted from F λ that covers E ´ and such that S G ≤ b N , hence       λ   μ   (   E  ′   )       λ  μ   superscript  E  normal-′     \displaystyle\lambda\,\mu(E^{\prime})   which implies the inequality above.  When dealing with the Lebesgue measure on R N , it is more customary to use the easier (and older) Vitali covering lemma in order to derive the previous maximal inequality (with a different constant).
