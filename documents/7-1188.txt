   Higman's lemma      Higman's lemma   In mathematics , Higman's lemma states that the set of finite sequences over a finite alphabet, as partially ordered by the subsequence relation, is well-quasi-ordered . That is, if     w  1   ,   w  2   ,  …      subscript  w  1    subscript  w  2   normal-…    w_{1},w_{2},\ldots   is an infinite sequence of words over some fixed finite alphabet, then there exist indices    i  <  j      i  j    i   such that    w  i     subscript  w  i    w_{i}   can be obtained from    w  j     subscript  w  j    w_{j}   by deleting some (possibly none) symbols. More generally this remains true when the alphabet is not necessarily finite, but is itself well-quasi-ordered, and the subsequence relation allows the replacement of symbols by earlier symbols in the well-quasi-ordering of labels. This is a special case of the later Kruskal's tree theorem . It is named after Graham Higman , who published it in 1952.
