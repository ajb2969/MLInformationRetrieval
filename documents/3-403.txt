   Frame bundle      Frame bundle   In mathematics , a frame bundle is a principal fiber bundle F( E ) associated to any vector bundle  E . The fiber of F( E ) over a point x is the set of all ordered bases , or frames , for E x . The general linear group acts naturally on F( E ) via a change of basis , giving the frame bundle the structure of a principal GL( k , R )-bundle (where k is the rank of E ).  The frame bundle of a smooth manifold is the one associated to its tangent bundle . For this reason it is sometimes called the tangent frame bundle .  Definition and construction  Let E → X be a real vector bundle of rank k over a topological space  X . A frame at a point x ∈ X is an ordered basis for the vector space E x . Equivalently, a frame can be viewed as a linear isomorphism       p  :    𝐑  k   →   E  x     .     normal-:  p   normal-→   superscript  𝐑  k    subscript  E  x      p:\mathbf{R}^{k}\to E_{x}.   The set of all frames at x , denoted F x , has a natural right action by the general linear group GL( k , R ) of invertible k × k matrices: a group element g ∈ GL( k , R ) acts on the frame p via composition to give a new frame        p  ∘  g   :    𝐑  k   →   E  x     .     normal-:    p  g    normal-→   superscript  𝐑  k    subscript  E  x      p\circ g:\mathbf{R}^{k}\to E_{x}.   This action of GL( k , R ) on F x is both free and transitive (This follows from the standard linear algebra result that there is a unique invertible linear transformation sending one basis onto another). As a topological space, F x is homeomorphic to GL( k , R ) although it lacks a group structure, since there is no "preferred frame". The space F x is said to be a GL( k , R )- torsor .  The frame bundle of E , denoted by F( E ) or F GL ( E ), is the disjoint union of all the F x :        F   (  E  )    =    ∐   x  ∈  X     F  x     .        normal-F  E     subscript  coproduct    x  X     subscript  F  x      \mathrm{F}(E)=\coprod_{x\in X}F_{x}.   Each point in F( E ) is a pair ( x , p ) where x is a point in X and p is a frame at x . There is a natural projection π : F( E ) → X which sends ( x , p ) to x . The group GL( k , R ) acts on F( E ) on the right as above. This action is clearly free and the orbits are just the fibers of π.  The frame bundle F( E ) can be given a natural topology and bundle structure determined by that of E . Let ( U i , φ i ) be a local trivialization of E . Then for each x ∈ U i one has a linear isomorphism φ i , x : E x → R k . This data determines a bijection       ψ  i   :     π   -  1     (   U  i   )    →     U  i   ×  GL    (  k  ,  𝐑  )        normal-:   subscript  ψ  i    normal-→     superscript  π    1     subscript  U  i         subscript  U  i   GL    k  𝐑       \psi_{i}:\pi^{-1}(U_{i})\to U_{i}\times\mathrm{GL}(k,\mathbf{R})   given by         ψ  i    (  x  ,  p  )    =   (  x  ,    φ   i  ,  x    ∘  p   )    .         subscript  ψ  i    x  p     x     subscript  φ   i  x    p      \psi_{i}(x,p)=(x,\varphi_{i,x}\circ p).   With these bijections, each π −1 ( U i ) can be given the topology of U i × GL( k , R ). The topology on F( E ) is the final topology coinduced by the inclusion maps π −1 ( U i ) → F( E ).  With all of the above data the frame bundle F( E ) becomes a principal fiber bundle over X with structure group GL( k , R ) and local trivializations ({ U i }, {ψ i }). One can check that the transition functions of F( E ) are the same as those of E .  The above all works in the smooth category as well: if E is a smooth vector bundle over a smooth manifold  M then the frame bundle of E can be given the structure of a smooth principal bundle over M .  Associated vector bundles  A vector bundle E and its frame bundle F( E ) are associated bundles . Each one determines the other. The frame bundle F( E ) can be constructed from E as above, or more abstractly using the fiber bundle construction theorem . With the latter method, F( E ) is the fiber bundle with same base, structure group, trivializing neighborhoods, and transition functions as E but with abstract fiber GL( k , R ), where the action of structure group GL( k , R ) on the fiber GL( k , R ) is that of left multiplication.  Given any linear representation ρ : GL( k , R ) → GL( V , F ) there is a vector bundle       F   (  E  )     ×  ρ   V      subscript   ρ     normal-F  E   V    \mathrm{F}(E)\times_{\rho}V   associated to F( E ) which is given by product F( E ) × V modulo the equivalence relation ( pg , v ) ~ ( p , ρ( g ) v ) for all g in GL( k , R ). Denote the equivalence classes by [ p , v ].  The vector bundle E is naturally isomorphic to the bundle F( E ) × ρ  R k where ρ is the fundamental representation of GL( k , R ) on R k . The isomorphism is given by       [  p  ,  v  ]   ↦   p   (  v  )       maps-to   p  v     p  v     [p,v]\mapsto p(v)   where v is a vector in R k and p : R k → E x is a frame at x . One can easily check that this map is well-defined .  Any vector bundle associated to E can be given by the above construction. For example, the dual bundle of E is given by F( E ) × ρ* ( R k )* where ρ* is the dual of the fundamental representation. Tensor bundles of E can be constructed in a similar manner.  Tangent frame bundle  The tangent frame bundle (or simply the frame bundle ) of a smooth manifold  M is the frame bundle associated to the tangent bundle of M . The frame bundle of M is often denoted F M or GL( M ) rather than F( TM ). If M is n -dimensional then the tangent bundle has rank n , so the frame bundle of M is a principal GL( n , R ) bundle over M .  Smooth frames  Local sections of the frame bundle of M are called smooth frames on M . The cross-section theorem for principal bundles states that the frame bundle is trivial over any open set in U in M which admits a smooth frame. Given a smooth frame s : U → F U , the trivialization ψ : F U → U × GL( n , R ) is given by       ψ   (  p  )    =   (  x  ,    s    (  x  )    -  1     ∘  p   )         ψ  p    x      s   superscript  x    1     p      \psi(p)=(x,s(x)^{-1}\circ p)   where p is a frame at x . It follows that a manifold is parallelizable if and only if the frame bundle of M admits a global section.  Since the tangent bundle of M is trivializable over coordinate neighborhoods of M so is the frame bundle. In fact, given any coordinate neighborhood U with coordinates ( x 1 ,…, x n ) the coordinate vector fields      (   ∂   ∂   x  1     ,  ⋯  ,   ∂   ∂   x  n     )           superscript  x  1     normal-⋯        superscript  x  n       \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{1}},\cdots,\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{n}}\right)   define a smooth frame on U . One of the advantages of working with frame bundles is that they allow one to work with frames other than coordinates frames; one can choose a frame adapted to the problem at hand. This is sometimes called the method of moving frames .  Solder form  The frame bundle of a manifold M is a special type of principal bundle in the sense that its geometry is fundamentally tied to the geometry of M . This relationship can be expressed by means of a vector-valued 1-form on F M called the solder form (also known as the fundamental or tautological 1-form ). Let x be a point of the manifold M and p a frame at x , so that      p  :    𝐑  n   →    T  x   M       normal-:  p   normal-→   superscript  𝐑  n      subscript  T  x   M      p:\mathbf{R}^{n}\to T_{x}M   is a linear isomorphism of R n with the tangent space of M at x . The solder form of F M is the R n -valued 1-form θ defined by        θ  p    (  ξ  )    =    p   -  1    d  π   (  ξ  )           subscript  θ  p   ξ      superscript  p    1    normal-d  π  ξ     \theta_{p}(\xi)=p^{-1}\mathrm{d}\pi(\xi)   where ξ is a tangent vector to F M at the point ( x , p ), p −1 : T x M → R n is the inverse of the frame map, and dπ is the differential of the projection map π : F M → M . The solder form is horizontal in the sense that it vanishes on vectors tangent to the fibers of π and right equivariant in the sense that        R  g  *   θ   =    g   -  1    θ          superscript   subscript  R  g     θ      superscript  g    1    θ     R_{g}^{*}\theta=g^{-1}\theta   where R g is right translation by g ∈ GL( n , R ). A form with these properties is called a basic or tensorial form on F M . Such forms are in 1-1 correspondence with TM -valued 1-forms on M which are, in turn, in 1-1 correspondence with smooth bundle maps  TM → TM over M . Viewed in this light θ is just the identity map on TM .  Orthonormal frame bundle  If a vector bundle E is equipped with a Riemannian bundle metric then each fiber E x is not only a vector space but an inner product space . It is then possible to talk about the set of all of orthonormal frames for E x . An orthonormal frame for E x is an ordered orthonormal basis for E x , or, equivalently, a linear isometry      p  :    𝐑  k   →   E  x       normal-:  p   normal-→   superscript  𝐑  k    subscript  E  x      p:\mathbf{R}^{k}\to E_{x}   where R k is equipped with the standard Euclidean metric . The orthogonal group O( k ) acts freely and transitively on the set of all orthonormal frames via right composition. In other words, the set of all orthonormal frames is a right O( k )- torsor .  The orthonormal frame bundle of E , denoted F O ( E ), is the set of all orthonormal frames at each point x in the base space X . It can be constructed by a method entirely analogous to that of the ordinary frame bundle. The orthonormal frame bundle of a rank k Riemannian vector bundle E → X is a principal O( k )-bundle over X . Again, the construction works just as well in the smooth category.  If the vector bundle E is orientable then one can define the oriented orthonormal frame bundle of E , denoted F SO ( E ), as the principal SO( k )-bundle of all positively oriented orthonormal frames.  If M is an n -dimensional Riemannian manifold , then the orthonormal frame bundle of M , denoted F O M or O( M ), is the orthonormal frame bundle associated to the tangent bundle of M (which is equipped with a Riemannian metric by definition). If M is orientable, then one also has the oriented orthonormal frame bundle F SO M .  Given a Riemannian vector bundle E , the orthonormal frame bundle is a principal O( k )- subbundle of the general linear frame bundle. In other words, the inclusion map      i  :     F  O    (  E  )    →    F  GL    (  E  )        normal-:  i   normal-→     subscript  normal-F  normal-O   E      subscript  normal-F  GL   E      i:{\mathrm{F}}_{\mathrm{O}}(E)\to{\mathrm{F}}_{\mathrm{GL}}(E)   is principal bundle map . One says that F O ( E ) is a reduction of the structure group of F GL ( E ) from GL( k , R ) to O( k ).  G -structures  If a smooth manifold M comes with additional structure it is often natural to consider a subbundle of the full frame bundle of M which is adapted to the given structure. For example, if M is a Riemannian manifold we saw above that it is natural to consider the orthonormal frame bundle of M . The orthonormal frame bundle is just a reduction of the structure group of F GL ( M ) to the orthogonal group O( n ).  In general, if M is a smooth n -manifold and G is a Lie subgroup of GL( n , R ) we define a G -structure on M to be a reduction of the structure group of F GL ( M ) to G . Explicitly, this is a principal G -bundle F G ( M ) over M together with a G -equivariant bundle map        F  G    (  M  )    →    F  GL    (  M  )       normal-→     subscript  normal-F  G   M      subscript  normal-F  GL   M     {\mathrm{F}}_{G}(M)\to{\mathrm{F}}_{\mathrm{GL}}(M)   over M .  In this language, a Riemannian metric on M gives rise to an O( n )-structure on M . The following are some other examples.   Every oriented manifold has an oriented frame bundle which is just a GL + ( n , R )-structure on M .  A volume form on M determines a SL( n , R )-structure on M .  A 2 n -dimensional symplectic manifold has a natural Sp(2 n , R )-structure.  A 2 n -dimensional complex or almost complex manifold has a natural GL( n , C )-structure.   In many of these instances, a G -structure on M uniquely determines the corresponding structure on M . For example, a SL( n , R )-structure on M determines a volume form on M . However, in some cases, such as for symplectic and complex manifolds, an added integrability condition is needed. A Sp(2 n , R )-structure on M uniquely determines a nondegenerate  2-form on M , but for M to be symplectic, this 2-form must also be closed .
