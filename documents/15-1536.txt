Geranylfarnesyl diphosphate synthase

Geranylfarnesyl diphosphate synthase (, FGPP synthase, (all-E) geranylfarnesyl diphosphate synthase, GFPS, Fgs) is an enzyme with system name geranylgeranyl-diphosphate:isopentenyl-diphosphate transtransferase (adding 1 isopentenyl unit).1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

geranylgeranyl diphosphate + isopentenyl diphosphate

 
  (2E,6E,10E,14E)-geranylfarnesyl diphosphate + diphosphate


The enzyme from Methanosarcina mazei is involved in biosynthesis of the polyprenyl side-chain of methanophenazine.
