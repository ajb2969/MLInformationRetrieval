   Shear rate      Shear rate   Shear rate is the rate at which a progressive shearing deformation is applied to some material.  Simple Shear  The shear rate for a fluid flowing between two parallel plates, one moving at a constant speed and the other one stationary ( Couette flow ), is defined by        γ  ˙   =   v  h    ,       normal-˙  γ     v  h     \dot{\gamma}=\frac{v}{h},     where:       γ  ˙     normal-˙  γ    \dot{\gamma}   is the shear rate, measured in reciprocal seconds ;     v   v   v   is the velocity of the moving plate, measured in meters per second;     h   h   h   is the distance between the two parallel plates, measured in meters.   Or:         γ  ˙    i  j    =     ∂   v  i     ∂   x  j     +    ∂   v  j     ∂   x  i       .       subscript   normal-˙  γ     i  j           subscript  v  i       subscript  x  j          subscript  v  j       subscript  x  i        \dot{\gamma}_{ij}=\frac{\partial v_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}+\frac{\partial v_{j}}{%
 \partial x_{i}}.     For the simple shear case, it is just a gradient of velocity in a flowing material. The SI unit of measurement for shear rate is s −1 , expressed as "reciprocal seconds" or " inverse seconds ". 1  The shear rate at the inner wall of a Newtonian fluid flowing within a pipe 2 is        γ  ˙   =    8  v   d    ,       normal-˙  γ       8  v   d     \dot{\gamma}=\frac{8v}{d},     where:       γ  ˙     normal-˙  γ    \dot{\gamma}   is the shear rate, measured in reciprocal seconds;     v   v   v   is the linear fluid velocity;     d   d   d   is the inside diameter of the pipe.   The linear fluid velocity v is related to the volumetric flow rate Q by       v  =   Q  A    ,      v    Q  A     v=\frac{Q}{A},     where A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe, which for an inside pipe radius of r is given by       A  =   π   r  2     ,      A    π   superscript  r  2      A=\pi r^{2},     thus producing       v  =   Q   π   r  2      .      v    Q    π   superscript  r  2       v=\frac{Q}{\pi r^{2}}.     Substituting the above into the earlier equation for the shear rate of a Newtonian fluid flowing within a pipe, and noting (in the denominator) that d = 2 r :        γ  ˙   =    8  v   d   =    8   (   Q   π   r  2     )     2  r     ,         normal-˙  γ       8  v   d            8    Q    π   superscript  r  2        2  r       \dot{\gamma}=\frac{8v}{d}=\frac{8\left(\frac{Q}{\pi r^{2}}\right)}{2r},     which simplifies to the following equivalent form for wall shear rate in terms of volumetric flow rate Q and inner pipe radius r :        γ  ˙   =    4  Q    π   r  3      .       normal-˙  γ       4  Q     π   superscript  r  3       \dot{\gamma}=\frac{4Q}{\pi r^{3}}.     For a Newtonian fluid wall, shear stress (    τ  w     subscript  τ  w    \tau_{w}   ) can be related to shear rate by     τ  w   =     γ  ˙   x   μ        subscript  τ  w      subscript   normal-˙  γ   x   μ     \tau_{w}=\dot{\gamma}_{x}\mu   , where   μ   μ   \mu   is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. For non-Newtonian fluids, there are different constitutive laws depending on the fluid, which relates the stress tensor to the shear rate tensor.
