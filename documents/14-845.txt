   Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction      Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction   In mathematics, the Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction or Lyapunov–Schmidt construction is used to study solutions to nonlinear equations in the case when the implicit function theorem does not work. It permits the reduction of infinite-dimensional equations in Banach spaces to finite-dimensional equations. It is named after Aleksandr Lyapunov and Erhard Schmidt .  Problem setup  Let       f   (  x  ,  λ  )    =   0         f   x  λ    0    f(x,\lambda)=0\,     be the given nonlinear equation,     X  ,  Λ   ,     X  normal-Λ    X,\Lambda,   and   Y   Y   Y   are Banach spaces (   Λ   normal-Λ   \Lambda   is the parameter space).    f   (  x  ,  λ  )       f   x  λ     f(x,\lambda)   is the    C  p     superscript  C  p    C^{p}   -map from a neighborhood of some point     (   x  0   ,   λ  0   )   ∈   X  ×  Λ         subscript  x  0    subscript  λ  0      X  normal-Λ     (x_{0},\lambda_{0})\in X\times\Lambda   to   Y   Y   Y   and the equation is satisfied at this point       f   (   x  0   ,   λ  0   )    =  0.        f    subscript  x  0    subscript  λ  0     0.    f(x_{0},\lambda_{0})=0.     For the case when the linear operator     f  x    (  x  ,  λ  )        subscript  f  x    x  λ     f_{x}(x,\lambda)   is invertible, the implicit function theorem assures that there exists a solution    x   (  λ  )       x  λ    x(\lambda)   satisfying the equation     f   (   x   (  λ  )    ,  λ  )    =  0        f     x  λ   λ    0    f(x(\lambda),\lambda)=0   at least locally close to    λ  0     subscript  λ  0    \lambda_{0}   .  In the opposite case, when the linear operator     f  x    (  x  ,  λ  )        subscript  f  x    x  λ     f_{x}(x,\lambda)   is non-invertible, the Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction can be applied in the following way.  Assumptions  One assumes that the operator     f  x    (  x  ,  λ  )        subscript  f  x    x  λ     f_{x}(x,\lambda)   is a Fredholm operator .        ker   f  x     (   x  0   ,   λ  0   )    =   X  1          kernel   subscript  f  x      subscript  x  0    subscript  λ  0      subscript  X  1     \ker f_{x}(x_{0},\lambda_{0})=X_{1}   and    X  1     subscript  X  1    X_{1}   has finite dimension.  The range of this operator     ran   f  x    (   x  0   ,   λ  0   )    =   Y  1         ran   subscript  f  x     subscript  x  0    subscript  λ  0      subscript  Y  1     \mathrm{ran}f_{x}(x_{0},\lambda_{0})=Y_{1}   has finite co-dimension and is a closed subspace in   Y   Y   Y   .  Without loss of generality, one can assume that      (   x  0   ,   λ  0   )   =   (  0  ,  0  )    .        subscript  x  0    subscript  λ  0     0  0     (x_{0},\lambda_{0})=(0,0).     Lyapunov–Schmidt construction  Let us split   Y   Y   Y   into the direct product    Y  =    Y  1   ⊕   Y  2        Y   direct-sum   subscript  Y  1    subscript  Y  2      Y=Y_{1}\oplus Y_{2}   , where     dim   Y  2    <  ∞       dimension   subscript  Y  2       \dim Y_{2}<\infty   .  Let   Q   Q   Q   be the projection operator onto    Y  1     subscript  Y  1    Y_{1}   .  Let us consider also the direct product    X  =    X  1   ⊕   X  2        X   direct-sum   subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2      X=X_{1}\oplus X_{2}   .  Applying the operators   Q   Q   Q   and    I  -  Q      I  Q    I-Q   to the original equation, one obtains the equivalent system       Q  f   (  x  ,  λ  )    =   0         Q  f   x  λ    0    Qf(x,\lambda)=0\,           (   I  -  Q   )   f   (  x  ,  λ  )    =   0           I  Q   f   x  λ    0    (I-Q)f(x,\lambda)=0\,     Let     x  1   ∈   X  1        subscript  x  1    subscript  X  1     x_{1}\in X_{1}   and     x  2   ∈   X  2        subscript  x  2    subscript  X  2     x_{2}\in X_{2}   , then the first equation       Q  f   (    x  1   +   x  2    ,  λ  )    =   0         Q  f      subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    λ    0    Qf(x_{1}+x_{2},\lambda)=0\,     can be solved with respect to    x  2     subscript  x  2    x_{2}   by applying the implicit function theorem to the operator      Q  f   (   x  1   +   x  2   ,  λ  )   :   X  2   ×   (   X  1   ×  Λ  )   →    Y  1       fragments  Q  f   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  1     subscript  x  2   normal-,  λ  normal-)   normal-:    subscript  X  2     fragments  normal-(   subscript  X  1    Λ  normal-)   normal-→   subscript  Y  1     Qf(x_{1}+x_{2},\lambda):\quad X_{2}\times(X_{1}\times\Lambda)\to Y_{1}\,     (now the conditions of the implicit function theorem are fulfilled).  Thus, there exists a unique solution     x  2    (   x  1   ,  λ  )        subscript  x  2     subscript  x  1   λ     x_{2}(x_{1},\lambda)   satisfying       Q  f   (    x  1   +    x  2    (   x  1   ,  λ  )     ,  λ  )    =   0         Q  f      subscript  x  1      subscript  x  2     subscript  x  1   λ     λ    0    Qf(x_{1}+x_{2}(x_{1},\lambda),\lambda)=0\,     Now substituting     x  2    (   x  1   ,  λ  )        subscript  x  2     subscript  x  1   λ     x_{2}(x_{1},\lambda)   into the second equation, one obtains the final finite-dimensional equation        (   I  -  Q   )   f   (    x  1   +    x  2    (   x  1   ,  λ  )     ,  λ  )    =   0           I  Q   f      subscript  x  1      subscript  x  2     subscript  x  1   λ     λ    0    (I-Q)f(x_{1}+x_{2}(x_{1},\lambda),\lambda)=0\,     Indeed, the last equation is now finite-dimensional, since the range of    (   I  -  Q   )      I  Q    (I-Q)   is finite-dimensional. This equation is now to be solved with respect to    x  1     subscript  x  1    x_{1}   , which is finite-dimensional, and parameters   λ   λ   \lambda     References   Louis Nirenberg , Topics in nonlinear functional analysis , New York Univ.
