Plastic moment

In structural engineering, the plastic moment (Mp) is a property of a structural section. It is defined as the moment at which the entire cross section has reached its yield stress. This is theoretically the maximum bending moment that the section can resist - when this point is reached a plastic hinge is formed and any load beyond this point will result in theoretically infinite plastic deformation. In practice most materials work harden resulting in increased stiffness and moment resistance until the material fails. This is of little significance in structural mechanics as the deflection prior to this occurring is considered to be an earlier failure point in the member.
Mp for a rectangular section can be calculated with the following formula: 
 
 

For other sections it is normal to calculate 
 
 
 
  then substitute it into the formula as follows: 
 
 

The plastic moment for a given section will always be larger than the yield moment (the bending moment at which the first part of the sections reaches the yield stress)
