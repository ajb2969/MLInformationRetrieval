Schwarz–Ahlfors–Pick theorem

In mathematics, the Schwarz–Ahlfors–Pick theorem is an extension of the Schwarz lemma for hyperbolic geometry, such as the Poincaré half-plane model.
The Schwarz–Pick lemma states that every holomorphic function from the unit disk U to itself, or from the upper half-plane H to itself, will not increase the Poincaré distance between points. The unit disk U with the Poincaré metric has negative Gaussian curvature −1. In 1938, Lars Ahlfors generalised the lemma to maps from the unit disk to other negatively curved surfaces:
Theorem (Schwarz–Ahlfors–Pick). Let U be the unit disk with Poincaré metric 
 
 
 
 ; let S be a Riemann surface endowed with a Hermitian metric

 
  whose Gaussian curvature is ≤ −1; let 
 
 
 
  be a holomorphic function. Then


 
  for all 
 
 

A generalization of this theorem was proved by Shing-Tung Yau in 1973.1
