   Lie algebra representation      Lie algebra representation   In the mathematical field of representation theory , a Lie algebra representation or representation of a Lie algebra is a way of writing a Lie algebra as a set of matrices (or endomorphisms of a vector space ) in such a way that the Lie bracket is given by the commutator .  The notion is closely related to that of a representation of a Lie group . Roughly speaking, the representations of Lie algebras are the differentiated form of representations of Lie groups, while the representations of the universal cover of a Lie group are the integrated form of the representations of its Lie algebra.  In the study of representations of a Lie algebra, a particular ring , called the universal enveloping algebra , associated with the Lie algebra plays a decisive role. The universality of this construction of this ring says that the category of representations of a Lie algebra is the same as the category of modules over its enveloping algebra.  Formal definition  A representation of a Lie algebra    𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is a Lie algebra homomorphism      ρ  :   𝔤  →   𝔤  𝔩   (  V  )        normal-:  ρ   normal-→  𝔤    𝔤  𝔩  V      \rho\colon\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{gl}(V)   from   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   to the Lie algebra of endomorphisms on a vector space  V (with the commutator as the Lie bracket), sending an element x of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   to an element ρ x of    𝔤  𝔩   (  V  )       𝔤  𝔩  V    \mathfrak{gl}(V)   .  Explicitly, this means that       ρ   [  x  ,  y  ]    =   [   ρ  x   ,   ρ  y   ]   =     ρ  x    ρ  y    -    ρ  y     ρ  x             subscript  ρ   x  y      subscript  ρ  x    subscript  ρ  y              subscript  ρ  x    subscript  ρ  y       subscript  ρ  y    subscript  ρ  x        \rho_{[x,y]}=[\rho_{x},\rho_{y}]=\rho_{x}\rho_{y}-\rho_{y}\rho_{x}\,   for all x,y in   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . The vector space V , together with the representation ρ, is called a    𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -module . (Many authors abuse terminology and refer to V itself as the representation).  The representation   ρ   ρ   \rho   is said to be faithful if it is injective.  One can equivalently define a   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -module as a vector space V together with a bilinear map      𝔤  ×  V   →  V     normal-→    𝔤  V   V    \mathfrak{g}\times V\to V   such that        [  x  ,  y  ]   ⋅  v   =    x  ⋅   (   y  ⋅  v   )    -   y  ⋅   (   x  ⋅  v   )          normal-⋅   x  y   v      normal-⋅  x   normal-⋅  y  v     normal-⋅  y   normal-⋅  x  v       [x,y]\cdot v=x\cdot(y\cdot v)-y\cdot(x\cdot v)   for all x,y in   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   and v in V . This is related to the previous definition by setting x ⋅ v = ρ x (v).  Examples  Adjoint representations  The most basic example of a Lie algebra representation is the adjoint representation of a Lie algebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   on itself:       ad  :    𝔤  →   𝔤  𝔩   (  𝔤  )     ,    x  ↦   ad  x    ,     ad  x    (  y  )    =   [  x  ,  y  ]       .     normal-:  ad   formulae-sequence   normal-→  𝔤    𝔤  𝔩  𝔤     formulae-sequence   maps-to  x   subscript  ad  x        subscript  ad  x   y    x  y        \textrm{ad}:\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{gl}(\mathfrak{g}),\quad x\mapsto%
 \operatorname{ad}_{x},\quad\operatorname{ad}_{x}(y)=[x,y].   Indeed, by virtue of the Jacobi identity ,   ad   ad   \operatorname{ad}   is a Lie algebra homomorphism.  Infinitesimal Lie group representations  A Lie algebra representation also arises in nature. If φ: G → H is a homomorphism of (real or complex) Lie groups , and   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   and   𝔥   𝔥   \mathfrak{h}   are the Lie algebras of G and H respectively, then the differential       d  e   ϕ   :   𝔤  →  𝔥      normal-:     subscript  d  e   ϕ    normal-→  𝔤  𝔥     d_{e}\phi:\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{h}   on tangent spaces at the identities is a Lie algebra homomorphism. In particular, for a finite-dimensional vector space V , a representation of Lie groups      ϕ  :   G  →   GL   (  V  )        normal-:  ϕ   normal-→  G    GL  V      \phi:G\to\mathrm{GL}(V)\,   determines a Lie algebra homomorphism       d  ϕ   :   𝔤  →   𝔤  𝔩   (  V  )        normal-:    d  ϕ    normal-→  𝔤    𝔤  𝔩  V      d\phi:\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{gl}(V)   from   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   to the Lie algebra of the general linear group GL( V ), i.e. the endomorphism algebra of V .  For example, let      c  g    (  x  )    =   g  x   g   -  1            subscript  c  g   x     g  x   superscript  g    1       c_{g}(x)=gxg^{-1}   . Then the differential of     c  g   :   G  →  G      normal-:   subscript  c  g    normal-→  G  G     c_{g}:G\to G   at the identity is an element of    GL   (  𝔤  )       GL  𝔤    \mathrm{GL}(\mathfrak{g})   . Denoting it by    Ad   (  g  )      Ad  g    \operatorname{Ad}(g)   one obtains a representation   Ad   Ad   \operatorname{Ad}   of G on the vector space   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . Applying the preceding, one gets the Lie algebra representation    d  Ad      d  Ad    d\operatorname{Ad}   . It can be shown that       d  e   Ad   =  ad   .         subscript  d  e   Ad   ad    d_{e}\operatorname{Ad}=\operatorname{ad}.     A partial converse to this statement says that every representation of a finite-dimensional (real or complex) Lie algebra lifts to a unique representation of the associated simply connected Lie group, so that representations of simply-connected Lie groups are in one-to-one correspondence with representations of their Lie algebras.  Basic concepts  Let   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   be a Lie algebra . Let V , W be   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -modules. Then a linear map    f  :   V  →  W      normal-:  f   normal-→  V  W     f:V\to W   is a homomorphism of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -modules if it is   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -equivariant; i.e.,     f   (   x  v   )    =   x  f   (  v  )          f    x  v      x  f  v     f(xv)=xf(v)   for any     x  ∈  𝔤   ,   v  ∈  V      formulae-sequence    x  𝔤     v  V     x\in\mathfrak{g},v\in V   . If f is bijective,    V  ,  W     V  W    V,W   are said to be equivalent . Similarly, many other constructions from module theory in abstract algebra carry over to this setting: submodule, quotient, subquotient, direct sum, Jordan-Hölder series, etc.  Let V be a   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -module. Then V is said to be semisimple or completely reducible if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions: (cf. semisimple module )   V is a direct sum of simple modules.  V is the sum of its simple submodules.  Every submodule of V is a direct summand : for every submodule W of V , there is a complement P such that V = W ⊕ P .   If   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero and V is finite-dimensional, then V is semisimple ( Weyl's complete reducibility theorem ). 1 A Lie algebra is said to be reductive if the adjoint representation is semisimple. Thus, a semisimple Lie algebra is reductive. An element v of V is said to be   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -invariant if     x  v   =  0        x  v   0    xv=0   for all    x  ∈  𝔤      x  𝔤    x\in\mathfrak{g}   . The set of all invariant elements is denoted by    V  𝔤     superscript  V  𝔤    V^{\mathfrak{g}}   .    V  ↦   V  𝔤      maps-to  V   superscript  V  𝔤     V\mapsto V^{\mathfrak{g}}   is a left-exact functor.  Basic constructions  If we have two representations, with V 1 and V 2 as their underlying vector spaces and ·[·] 1 and ·[·] 2 as the representations, then the product of both representations would have V 1 ⊗ V 2 as the underlying vector space and        x   [    v  1   ⊗   v  2    ]    =     x   [   v  1   ]    ⊗   v  2    +     v  1   ⊗  x    [   v  2   ]      .        x   delimited-[]   tensor-product   subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2         tensor-product    x   delimited-[]   subscript  v  1      subscript  v  2       tensor-product   subscript  v  1   x    delimited-[]   subscript  v  2        x[v_{1}\otimes v_{2}]=x[v_{1}]\otimes v_{2}+v_{1}\otimes x[v_{2}].     If L is a real Lie algebra and ρ: L × V → V is a complex representation of it, we can construct another representation of L called its dual representation as follows.  Let V ∗ be the dual vector space of V . In other words, V ∗ is the set of all linear maps from V to C with addition defined over it in the usual linear way, but scalar multiplication defined over it such that      (   z  ω   )    [  X  ]    =    z  ¯   ω   [  X  ]            z  ω    delimited-[]  X       normal-¯  z   ω   delimited-[]  X      (z\omega)[X]=\bar{z}\omega[X]   for any z in C , ω in V ∗ and X in V . This is usually rewritten as a contraction with a sesquilinear form 〈·,·〉. i.e. 〈ω, X 〉 is defined to be ω[ X ].  We define    ρ  ¯     normal-¯  ρ    \bar{\rho}   as follows:   〈    ρ  ¯     normal-¯  ρ    \bar{\rho}   ( A )[ω], X 〉 + 〈ω, ρ A [ X ]〉 = 0,   for any A in L , ω in V ∗ and X in V . This defines    ρ  ¯     normal-¯  ρ    \bar{\rho}   uniquely.  Let    V  ,  W     V  W    V,W   be   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -modules,   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   a Lie algebra. Then    Hom   (  V  ,  W  )      Hom  V  W    \operatorname{Hom}(V,W)   becomes a   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -module by setting      (   x  ⋅  f   )    (  v  )    =    x  f   (  v  )    -   f   (   x  v   )            normal-⋅  x  f   v       x  f  v     f    x  v       (x\cdot f)(v)=xf(v)-f(xv)   . In particular,     Hom  𝔤    (  V  ,  W  )   =  Hom    (  V  ,  W  )   𝔤      fragments   subscript  Hom  𝔤    fragments  normal-(  V  normal-,  W  normal-)    Hom   superscript   fragments  normal-(  V  normal-,  W  normal-)   𝔤     \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathfrak{g}}(V,W)=\operatorname{Hom}(V,W)^{\mathfrak{g}}   . Since any field becomes a   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -module with a trivial action, taking W to be the base field, the dual vector space    V  *     superscript  V     V^{*}   becomes a   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -module.  Enveloping algebras  To each Lie algebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   over a field k , one can associate a certain ring called the universal enveloping algebra of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . The construction is universal and consequently (along with the PBW theorem) representations of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   corresponds in one-to-one with algebra representations of universal enveloping algebra of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . The construction is as follows. 2 Let T be the tensor algebra of the vector space   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . Thus, by definition,    T  =   ⊕   n  =  0   ∞    ⊗  1  n   𝔤     fragments  T    superscript   subscript  direct-sum    n  0       superscript   subscript  tensor-product  1   n   g    T=\oplus_{n=0}^{\infty}\otimes_{1}^{n}\mathfrak{g}   and the multiplication on it is given by   ⊗   tensor-product   \otimes   . Let    U   (  𝔤  )       U  𝔤    U(\mathfrak{g})   be the quotient ring of T by the ideal generated by elements      [  x  ,  y  ]   -   x  ⊗  y    +   y  ⊗  x          x  y    tensor-product  x  y     tensor-product  y  x     [x,y]-x\otimes y+y\otimes x   . Since    U   (  𝔤  )       U  𝔤    U(\mathfrak{g})   is an associative algebra over the field k , it can be turned into a Lie algebra via the commutator     [  x  ,  y  ]   =    x  y   -   y  x         x  y       x  y     y  x      [x,y]=xy-yx   (omitting   ⊗   tensor-product   \otimes   from the notation). There is a canonical morphism of Lie algebras    𝔤  →   U   (  𝔤  )       normal-→  𝔤    U  𝔤     \mathfrak{g}\to U(\mathfrak{g})   obtained by restricting    T  →   U   (  𝔤  )       normal-→  T    U  𝔤     T\to U(\mathfrak{g})   to degree one piece. The PBW theorem implies that the canonical map is actually injective. Note if   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is abelian , then    U   (  𝔤  )       U  𝔤    U(\mathfrak{g})   is the symmetric algebra of the vector space   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   .  Since   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is a module over itself via adjoint representation, the enveloping algebra    U   (  𝔤  )       U  𝔤    U(\mathfrak{g})   becomes a   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -module by extending the adjoint representation. But one can also use the left and right regular representation to make the enveloping algebra a   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -module; namely, with the notation       l  x    (  y  )    =   x  y    ,    x  ∈  𝔤   ,   y  ∈   U   (  𝔤  )         formulae-sequence       subscript  l  x   y     x  y     formulae-sequence    x  𝔤     y    U  𝔤       l_{x}(y)=xy,x\in\mathfrak{g},y\in U(\mathfrak{g})   , the mapping    x  ↦   l  x      maps-to  x   subscript  l  x     x\mapsto l_{x}   defines a representation of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   on    U   (  𝔤  )       U  𝔤    U(\mathfrak{g})   . The right regular representation is defined similarly.  Induced representation  Let   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero and    𝔥  ⊂  𝔤      𝔥  𝔤    \mathfrak{h}\subset\mathfrak{g}   a subalgebra.    U   (  𝔥  )       U  𝔥    U(\mathfrak{h})   acts on    U   (  𝔤  )       U  𝔤    U(\mathfrak{g})   from the right and thus, for any   𝔥   𝔥   \mathfrak{h}   -module W , one can form the left    U   (  𝔤  )       U  𝔤    U(\mathfrak{g})   -module     U   (  𝔤  )     ⊗   U   (  𝔥  )     W      subscript  tensor-product    U  𝔥      U  𝔤   W    U(\mathfrak{g})\otimes_{U(\mathfrak{h})}W   . It is a   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -module denoted by     Ind  𝔥  𝔤   W      superscript   subscript  Ind  𝔥   𝔤   W    \operatorname{Ind}_{\mathfrak{h}}^{\mathfrak{g}}W   and called the   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -module induced by W . It satisfies (and is in fact characterized by) the universal property: for any   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -module E        Hom  𝔤    (    Ind  𝔥  𝔤   W   ,  E  )    ≃    Hom  𝔥    (  W  ,    Res  𝔥  𝔤   E   )       similar-to-or-equals    subscript  Hom  𝔤     superscript   subscript  Ind  𝔥   𝔤   W   E     subscript  Hom  𝔥   W    subscript   superscript  Res  𝔤   𝔥   E      \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathfrak{g}}(\operatorname{Ind}_{\mathfrak{h}}^{\mathfrak%
 {g}}W,E)\simeq\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathfrak{h}}(W,\operatorname{Res}^{%
 \mathfrak{g}}_{\mathfrak{h}}E)   . Furthermore,    Ind  𝔥  𝔤     superscript   subscript  Ind  𝔥   𝔤    \operatorname{Ind}_{\mathfrak{h}}^{\mathfrak{g}}   is an exact functor from the category of   𝔥   𝔥   \mathfrak{h}   -modules to the category of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -modules. These uses the fact that    U   (  𝔤  )       U  𝔤    U(\mathfrak{g})   is a free right module over    U   (  𝔥  )       U  𝔥    U(\mathfrak{h})   . In particular, if     Ind  𝔥  𝔤   W      superscript   subscript  Ind  𝔥   𝔤   W    \operatorname{Ind}_{\mathfrak{h}}^{\mathfrak{g}}W   is simple (resp. absolutely simple), then W is simple (resp. absolutely simple). Here, a   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -module V is absolutely simple if    V   ⊗  k   F      subscript  tensor-product  k   V  F    V\otimes_{k}F   is simple for any field extension    F  /  k      F  k    F/k   .  The induction is transitive     Ind  𝔥  𝔤   ≃    Ind   𝔥  ′   𝔤   ∘   Ind  𝔥   𝔥  ′        similar-to-or-equals   superscript   subscript  Ind  𝔥   𝔤      superscript   subscript  Ind   superscript  𝔥  normal-′    𝔤    superscript   subscript  Ind  𝔥    superscript  𝔥  normal-′       \operatorname{Ind}_{\mathfrak{h}}^{\mathfrak{g}}\simeq\operatorname{Ind}_{%
 \mathfrak{h^{\prime}}}^{\mathfrak{g}}\circ\operatorname{Ind}_{\mathfrak{h}}^{%
 \mathfrak{h^{\prime}}}   for any Lie subalgebra     𝔥  ′   ⊂  𝔤       superscript  𝔥  normal-′   𝔤    \mathfrak{h^{\prime}}\subset\mathfrak{g}   and any Lie subalgebra    𝔥  ⊂   𝔥  ′       𝔥   superscript  𝔥  normal-′     \mathfrak{h}\subset\mathfrak{h}^{\prime}   . The induction commutes with restriction: let    𝔥  ⊂  𝔤      𝔥  𝔤    \mathfrak{h}\subset\mathfrak{g}   be subalgebra and   𝔫   𝔫   \mathfrak{n}   an ideal of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   that is contained in   𝔥   𝔥   \mathfrak{h}   . Set     𝔤  1   =   𝔤  /  𝔫        subscript  𝔤  1     𝔤  𝔫     \mathfrak{g}_{1}=\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{n}   and     𝔥  1   =   𝔥  /  𝔫        subscript  𝔥  1     𝔥  𝔫     \mathfrak{h}_{1}=\mathfrak{h}/\mathfrak{n}   . Then      Ind  𝔥  𝔤   ∘   Res  𝔥    ≃    Res  𝔤   ∘   Ind   𝔥  1    𝔤  1        similar-to-or-equals     subscript   superscript  Ind  𝔤   𝔥    subscript  Res  𝔥       subscript  Res  𝔤    subscript   superscript  Ind   subscript  𝔤  1     subscript  𝔥  1       \operatorname{Ind}^{\mathfrak{g}}_{\mathfrak{h}}\circ\operatorname{Res}_{%
 \mathfrak{h}}\simeq\operatorname{Res}_{\mathfrak{g}}\circ\operatorname{Ind}^{%
 \mathfrak{g_{1}}}_{\mathfrak{h_{1}}}   .  Representations of a semisimple Lie algebra  Let   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   be a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero. (in the solvable or nilpotent case, one studies primitive ideals of the enveloping algebra; cf. Dixmier for the definitive account.)  The category of modules over   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   turns out to be too large especially for homological algebra methods to be useful: it was realized that a smaller subcategory category O is a better place for the representation theory in the semisimple case in zero characteristic. For instance, the category O turned out to be of a right size to formulate the celebrated BGG reciprocity . 3  (g,K)-module  One of the most important applications of Lie algebra representations is to the representation theory of real reductive Lie group. The application is based on the idea that if   π   π   \pi   is a Hilbert-space representation of, say, a connected real semisimple linear Lie group G , then it has two natural actions: the complexification   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   and the connected maximal compact subgroup  K . The   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -module structure of   π   π   \pi   allows algebraic especially homological methods to be applied and   K   K   K   -module structure allows harmonic analysis to be carried out in a way similar to that on connected compact semisimple Lie groups.  Classification  Finite-dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras  Similarly to how semisimple Lie algebras can be classified, the finite-dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras can be classified. This is a classical theory, widely regarded as beautiful, and a standard reference is .  Briefly, finite-dimensional representations of a semisimple Lie algebra are completely reducible , so it suffices to classify irreducible (simple) representations. Semisimple Lie algebras are classified in terms of the weights of the adjoint representation, the so-called root system ; in a similar manner all finite-dimensional irreducible representations can be understood in terms of weights; see weight (representation theory) for details.  Representation on an algebra  If we have a Lie superalgebra L , then a representation of L on an algebra is a (not necessarily associative ) Z 2 graded  algebra  A which is a representation of L as a Z 2  graded vector space and in addition, the elements of L acts as derivations / antiderivations on A .  More specifically, if H is a pure element of L and x and y are pure elements of A ,   H [ xy ] = ( H [ x ]) y + (−1) xH x ( H [ y ])   Also, if A is unital , then   H [1] = 0   Now, for the case of a representation of a Lie algebra , we simply drop all the gradings and the (−1) to the some power factors.  A Lie (super)algebra is an algebra and it has an adjoint representation of itself. This is a representation on an algebra: the (anti)derivation property is the super Jacobi identity .  If a vector space is both an associative algebra and a Lie algebra and the adjoint representation of the Lie algebra on itself is a representation on an algebra (i.e., acts by derivations on the associative algebra structure), then it is a Poisson algebra . The analogous observation for Lie superalgebras gives the notion of a Poisson superalgebra .
