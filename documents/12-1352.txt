   Degree diameter problem      Degree diameter problem   In graph theory , the degree diameter problem is the problem of finding the largest possible graph  G (in terms of the size of its vertex set V ) of diameter  k such that the largest degree of any of the vertices in G is at most d . The size of G is bounded above by the Moore bound ; for 1 n_{d,k} be the maximum possible of vertices for a graph with degree at most d and diameter k then     n   d  ,  k    ≤   M   d  ,  k         subscript  n   d  k     subscript  M   d  k      n_{d,k}\leq M_{d,k}   , where    M   d  ,  k      subscript  M   d  k     M_{d,k}   is the Moore bound :       M   d  ,  k    =   {      1  +   d       (   d  -  1   )   k   -  1    d  -  2           if  d   >  2         2  k   +  1       if  d   =  2            subscript  M   d  k     cases    1    d       superscript    d  1   k   1     d  2          if  d   2       2  k   1       if  d   2      M_{d,k}=\begin{cases}1+d\frac{(d-1)^{k}-1}{d-2}&\text{ if }d>2\\
 2k+1&\text{ if }d=2\end{cases}     This bound is attained for very few graphs, thus the study moves to how close there exist graphs to the Moore bound. For asymptotic behaviour note that     M   d  ,  k    =    d  k   +   O   (   d   k  -  1    )          subscript  M   d  k       superscript  d  k     O   superscript  d    k  1        M_{d,k}=d^{k}+O(d^{k-1})   .  Define the parameter     μ  k   =    lim inf   d  →  ∞      n   d  ,  k     d  k          subscript  μ  k     subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  d        subscript  n   d  k     superscript  d  k       \mu_{k}=\liminf_{d\to\infty}\frac{n_{d,k}}{d^{k}}   . It is conjectured that     μ  k   =  1       subscript  μ  k   1    \mu_{k}=1   for all k . It is known that     μ  1   =   μ  2   =   μ  3   =   μ  5   =  1         subscript  μ  1    subscript  μ  2         subscript  μ  3         subscript  μ  5        1     \mu_{1}=\mu_{2}=\mu_{3}=\mu_{5}=1   and that     μ  4   ≥   1  /  4        subscript  μ  4     1  4     \mu_{4}\geq 1/4   . For the general case it is known that     μ  k   ≥   1.6  k        subscript  μ  k    superscript  1.6  k     \mu_{k}\geq 1.6^{k}   . Thus, although is conjectured that     μ  k   =  1       subscript  μ  k   1    \mu_{k}=1   is still open if it is actually exponential.
