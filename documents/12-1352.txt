Degree diameter problem

In graph theory, the degree diameter problem is the problem of finding the largest possible graph G (in terms of the size of its vertex set V) of diameter k such that the largest degree of any of the vertices in G is at most d. The size of G is bounded above by the Moore bound; for 1Â n_{d,k} be the maximum possible of vertices for a graph with degree at most d and diameter k then 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the Moore bound:



This bound is attained for very few graphs, thus the study moves to how close there exist graphs to the Moore bound. For asymptotic behaviour note that 
 
 
 
 .
Define the parameter 
 
 
 
 . It is conjectured that 
 
 
 
  for all k. It is known that 
 
 
 
  and that 
 
 
 
 . For the general case it is known that 
 
 
 
 . Thus, although is conjectured that 
 
 
 
  is still open if it is actually exponential.
