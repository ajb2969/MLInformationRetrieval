   Lehmer's conjecture      Lehmer's conjecture   Lehmer's conjecture , also known as the Lehmer's Mahler measure problem, is a problem in number theory raised by Derrick Henry Lehmer . 1 The conjecture asserts that there is an absolute constant    μ  >  1      μ  1    \mu>1   such that every polynomial with integer coefficients     P   (  x  )    ∈   ℤ   [  x  ]          P  x     ℤ   delimited-[]  x      P(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x]   satisfies one of the following properties:   The Mahler measure     ℳ   (   P   (  x  )    )       ℳ    P  x     \mathcal{M}(P(x))   of    P   (  x  )       P  x    P(x)   is greater than or equal to   μ   μ   \mu   .        P   (  x  )       P  x    P(x)   is an integral multiple of a product of cyclotomic polynomials or the monomial   x   x   x   , in which case     ℳ   (   P   (  x  )    )    =  1        ℳ    P  x    1    \mathcal{M}(P(x))=1   . (Equivalently, every complex root of    P   (  x  )       P  x    P(x)   is a root of unity or zero.)   There are a number of definitions of the Mahler measure, one of which is to factor    P   (  x  )       P  x    P(x)   over   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   as        P   (  x  )    =    a  0    (   x  -   α  1    )    (   x  -   α  2    )   ⋯   (   x  -   α  D    )     ,        P  x      subscript  a  0     x   subscript  α  1      x   subscript  α  2    normal-⋯    x   subscript  α  D       P(x)=a_{0}(x-\alpha_{1})(x-\alpha_{2})\cdots(x-\alpha_{D}),     and then set        ℳ   (   P   (  x  )    )    =    |   a  0   |     ∏   i  =  1   D    max   (  1  ,   |   α  i   |   )       .        ℳ    P  x         subscript  a  0      superscript   subscript  product    i  1    D     1     subscript  α  i         \mathcal{M}(P(x))=|a_{0}|\prod_{i=1}^{D}\max(1,|\alpha_{i}|).     The smallest known Mahler measure (greater than 1) is for "Lehmer's polynomial"        P   (  x  )    =      x  10   +   x  9    -   x  7   -   x  6   -   x  5   -   x  4   -   x  3    +  x  +   1     ,        P  x          superscript  x  10    superscript  x  9     superscript  x  7    superscript  x  6    superscript  x  5    superscript  x  4    superscript  x  3    x  1     P(x)=x^{10}+x^{9}-x^{7}-x^{6}-x^{5}-x^{4}-x^{3}+x+1\,,     for which the Mahler measure is the Salem number 2        ℳ   (   P   (  x  )    )    =   1.176280818   …     .        ℳ    P  x      1.176280818  normal-…     \mathcal{M}(P(x))=1.176280818\dots\ .     It is widely believed that this example represents the true minimal value: that is,    μ  =   1.176280818  …       μ    1.176280818  normal-…     \mu=1.176280818\dots   in Lehmer's conjecture. 3 4  Motivation  Consider Mahler measure for one variable and Jensen's formula shows that if     P   (  x  )    =    a  0    (   x  -   α  1    )    (   x  -   α  2    )   ⋯   (   x  -   α  D    )          P  x      subscript  a  0     x   subscript  α  1      x   subscript  α  2    normal-⋯    x   subscript  α  D       P(x)=a_{0}(x-\alpha_{1})(x-\alpha_{2})\cdots(x-\alpha_{D})   then        ℳ   (   P   (  x  )    )    =    |   a  0   |     ∏   i  =  1   D    max   (  1  ,   |   α  i   |   )       .        ℳ    P  x         subscript  a  0      superscript   subscript  product    i  1    D     1     subscript  α  i         \mathcal{M}(P(x))=|a_{0}|\prod_{i=1}^{D}\max(1,|\alpha_{i}|).   In this paragraph denote    m   (  P  )   =  log   (  ℳ   (  P   (  x  )   )       fragments  m   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-)      fragments  normal-(  M   fragments  normal-(  P   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-)      m(P)=\log(\mathcal{M}(P(x))   , which is also called Mahler measure .  If   P   P   P   has integer coefficients, this shows that    ℳ   (  P  )       ℳ  P    \mathcal{M}(P)   is an algebraic number so    m   (  P  )       m  P    m(P)   is the logarithm of an algebraic integer. It also shows that     m   (  P  )    ≥  0        m  P   0    m(P)\geq 0   and that if     m   (  P  )    =  0        m  P   0    m(P)=0   then   P   P   P   is a product of cyclotomic polynomials i.e. monic polynomials whose all roots are roots of unity, or a monomial polynomial of   x   x   x   i.e. a power    x  n     superscript  x  n    x^{n}   for some   n   n   n   .  Lehmer noticed 5 6 that     m   (  P  )    =  0        m  P   0    m(P)=0   is an important value in the study of the integer sequences     Δ  n   =   Res   (   P   (  x  )    ,    x  n   -  1   )    =    ∏   i  =  1   D    (    α  i  n   -  1   )           subscript  normal-Δ  n     Res     P  x      superscript  x  n   1            subscript   superscript  product  D     i  1       superscript   subscript  α  i   n   1       \Delta_{n}=\text{Res}(P(x),x^{n}-1)=\prod^{D}_{i=1}(\alpha_{i}^{n}-1)   for monic   P   P   P   . If   P   P   P   does not vanish on the circle then     lim    |   Δ  n   |    1  /  n     =   ℳ   (  P  )           superscript     subscript  normal-Δ  n      1  n       ℳ  P     \lim|\Delta_{n}|^{1/n}=\mathcal{M}(P)   and this statement might be true even if   P   P   P   does vanish on the circle. By this he was led to ask   whether there is a constant    c  >  0      c  0    c>0   such that     m   (  P  )    >  c        m  P   c    m(P)>c   provided   P   P   P   is not cyclotomic?,   or   given    c  >  0      c  0    c>0   , are there   P   P   P   with integer coefficients for which 0   Some positive answers have been provided as follows, but Lehmer's conjecture is not yet completely proved and is still a question of much interest.  Partial results  Let     P   (  x  )    ∈   ℤ   [  x  ]          P  x     ℤ   delimited-[]  x      P(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x]   be an irreducible monic polynomial of degree   D   D   D   .  Smyth 7 proved that Lehmer's conjecture is true for all polynomials that are not reciprocal , i.e., all polynomials satisfying      x  D   P   (   x   -  1    )    ≠   P   (  x  )           superscript  x  D   P   superscript  x    1       P  x     x^{D}P(x^{-1})\neq P(x)   .  Blanksby and Montgomery 8 and Stewart 9 independently proved that there is an absolute constant    C  >  1      C  1    C>1   such that either     ℳ   (   P   (  x  )    )    =  1        ℳ    P  x    1    \mathcal{M}(P(x))=1   or 10         log  ℳ    (   P   (  x  )    )    ≥   C   D   log  D      .          ℳ     P  x      C    D    D       \log\mathcal{M}(P(x))\geq\frac{C}{D\log D}.     Dobrowolski 11 improved this to         log  ℳ    (   P   (  x  )    )    ≥   C    (    log   log  D     log  D    )   3     .          ℳ     P  x      C   superscript        D      D    3      \log\mathcal{M}(P(x))\geq C\left(\frac{\log\log D}{\log D}\right)^{3}.     Dobrowolski obtained the value C ≥ 1/1200 and asymptotically C > 1-ε for all sufficiently large D . Voutier obtained C ≥ 1/4 for D ≥ 2. 12  Elliptic analogues  Let    E  /  K      E  K    E/K   be an elliptic curve defined over a number field   K   K   K   , and let      h  ^   E   :    E   (   K  ¯   )    →  ℝ      normal-:   subscript   normal-^  h   E    normal-→    E   normal-¯  K    ℝ     \hat{h}_{E}:E(\bar{K})\to\mathbb{R}   be the canonical height function. The canonical height is the analogue for elliptic curves of the function      (   deg  P   )    -  1     log  ℳ    (   P   (  x  )    )        superscript   degree  P     1      ℳ     P  x     (\deg P)^{-1}\log\mathcal{M}(P(x))   . It has the property that       h  ^   E    (  Q  )    =  0         subscript   normal-^  h   E   Q   0    \hat{h}_{E}(Q)=0   if and only if   Q   Q   Q   is a torsion point in    E   (   K  ¯   )       E   normal-¯  K     E(\bar{K})   . The elliptic Lehmer conjecture asserts that there is a constant     C   (   E  /  K   )    >  0        C    E  K    0    C(E/K)>0   such that         h  ^   E    (  Q  )    ≥    C   (   E  /  K   )    D          subscript   normal-^  h   E   Q       C    E  K    D     \hat{h}_{E}(Q)\geq\frac{C(E/K)}{D}   for all non-torsion points    Q  ∈   E   (   K  ¯   )        Q    E   normal-¯  K      Q\in E(\bar{K})   ,  where    D  =   [  K   (  Q  )   :  K  ]      fragments  D    fragments  normal-[  K   fragments  normal-(  Q  normal-)   normal-:  K  normal-]     D=[K(Q):K]   . If the elliptic curve E has complex multiplication , then the analogue of Dobrowolski's result holds:          h  ^   E    (  Q  )    ≥     C   (   E  /  K   )    D     (    log   log  D     log  D    )   3     ,         subscript   normal-^  h   E   Q         C    E  K    D    superscript        D      D    3      \hat{h}_{E}(Q)\geq\frac{C(E/K)}{D}\left(\frac{\log\log D}{\log D}\right)^{3},     due to Laurent. 13 For arbitrary elliptic curves, the best known result is 14          h  ^   E    (  Q  )    ≥    C   (   E  /  K   )      D  3     (   log  D   )   2      ,         subscript   normal-^  h   E   Q       C    E  K       superscript  D  3    superscript    D   2       \hat{h}_{E}(Q)\geq\frac{C(E/K)}{D^{3}(\log D)^{2}},     due to Masser . 15 For elliptic curves with non-integral j-invariant , this has been improved to 16          h  ^   E    (  Q  )    ≥    C   (   E  /  K   )      D  2     (   log  D   )   2      ,         subscript   normal-^  h   E   Q       C    E  K       superscript  D  2    superscript    D   2       \hat{h}_{E}(Q)\geq\frac{C(E/K)}{D^{2}(\log D)^{2}},     by Hindry and Silverman . 17  Restricted results  Stronger results are known for restricted classes of polynomials or algebraic numbers.  If P ( x ) is not reciprocal then       M   (  P  )    ≥   M   (    x  3   -  x  -  1   )    ≈  1.3247          M  P     M     superscript  x  3   x  1         1.3247     M(P)\geq M(x^{3}-x-1)\approx 1.3247     and this is clearly best possible. 18 If further all the coefficients of P are odd then 19       M   (  P  )    ≥   M   (    x  2   -  x  -  1   )    ≈  1.618.          M  P     M     superscript  x  2   x  1         1.618.     M(P)\geq M(x^{2}-x-1)\approx 1.618.     If the field Q ( α ) is a Galois extension of Q then Lehmer's conjecture holds. 20  References     External links   http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/~mjm/Lehmer/ is a nice reference about the problem.
