   Cartesian monoidal category      Cartesian monoidal category   In mathematics, specifically in the field known as category theory , a monoidal category where the monoidal ("tensor") product is the categorical product is called a cartesian monoidal category . Any category with finite products (a "finite product category") can be thought of as a cartesian monoidal category. In any cartesian monoidal category, the terminal object is the tensor unit. Dually , a monoidal finite coproduct category with the monoidal structure given by the coproduct and unit the initial object is called a cocartesian monoidal category , and any finite coproduct category can be thought of as a cocartesian monoidal category.  Properties  Cartesian monoidal categories have a number of special and important properties, such as the existence of diagonal maps Δ x : x → x ⊗ x and augmentations e x : x → I for any object x . In applications to computer science we can think of Δ as ‘duplicating data’ and e as ‘deleting’ data. These maps make any object into a comonoid. In fact, any object in a cartesian monoidal category becomes a comonoid in a unique way.  Examples  Cartesian monoidal categories:   Set , the category of sets with the singleton set serving as the unit.  Cat , the bicategory of small categories with the product category , where the category with one object and only its identity map is the unit.   Cocartesian monoidal categories:   Vect , the category of vector spaces over a given field , can be made cocartesian monoidal with the "tensor product" given by the direct sum of vector spaces and the trivial vector space as unit.  Ab , the category of abelian groups , with the direct sum of abelian groups as monoidal product and the trivial group as unit.  More generally, the category R-mod of (left) modules on a ring (commutative or not) becomes a cocartesian monoidal category with the direct sum of modules as tensor product and the trivial module as unit.   In each of these categories of modules equipped with a cocartesian monoidal structure, finite products and coproducts coincide (in the sense that the product and coproduct of finitely many objects are isomorphic), or more formally that if f : X 1 ∐ ... ∐ X n → X 1 × ... × X n is the "canonical" map from the n -ary coproduct of objects X j to their product, for a natural number n , in the event that the map f is an isomorphism , we say that a biproduct for the objects X j is an object     X  =    ⊕   j  ∈   1  ,  …  ,  n      X  j     .      X    subscript  direct-sum    j   1  normal-…  n      subscript  X  j      X=\bigoplus_{j\in{1,\ldots,n}}X_{j}.   isomorphic to    X  =    ∐   j  ∈   1  ,  …  ,  n      X  j        X    subscript  coproduct    j   1  normal-…  n      subscript  X  j      X=\coprod_{j\in{1,\ldots,n}}X_{j}   and    X  =    ∏   j  ∈   1  ,  …  ,  n      X  j        X    subscript  product    j   1  normal-…  n      subscript  X  j      X=\prod_{j\in{1,\ldots,n}}X_{j}   together with maps i j : X j → X and p j : X → X j such that the pair ( X , { i j }) is a coproduct diagram for the objects X j and the pair ( X , { p j }) is a product diagram for the objects X j , and where p j ∘ i j = id X j . If in addition the category in question has a zero object , so that for any objects A and B there is a unique map 0 A , B : A → 0 → B , it often follows that p k ∘ i j = : δ ij , the Kronecker delta , where we interpret 0 and 1 as the 0 maps and identity maps of the objects X j and X k , respectively.
