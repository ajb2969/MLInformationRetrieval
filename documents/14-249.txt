   Wente torus      Wente torus   In differential geometry , a Wente torus is an immersed  torus in    ℝ  3     superscript  ℝ  3    \mathbb{R}^{3}   of constant mean curvature , discovered by . It is a counterexample to the conjecture of Heinz Hopf that every closed , compact , constant-mean-curvature surface is a sphere (though this is true if the surface is embedded ). There are similar examples known for every positive genus .  References    The Wente torus , University of Toledo Mathematics Department, retrieved 2013-09-01.
