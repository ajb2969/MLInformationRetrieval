   Category:Singular integrals      Category:Singular integrals   In mathematics , singular integrals are central to abstract harmonic analysis and are intimately connected with the study of partial differential equations. Broadly speaking a singular integral is an integral operator        T   (  f  )    (  x  )    =   ∫   K   (  x  ,  y  )   f   (  y  )   d  y     ,        T  f  x       K   x  y   f  y  d  y      T(f)(x)=\int K(x,y)f(y)\,dy,     whose kernel function K : R n × R n → R n is singular along the diagonal x = y .
