   Lozenge      Lozenge   A lozenge ( ◊ ), often referred to as a diamond , is a form of rhombus . The definition of lozenge is not strictly fixed, and it is sometimes used simply as a synonym (from the French  losange ) for rhombus. Most often, though, lozenge refers to a thin rhombus—a rhombus with acute angles of less than 45°. 1 The lozenge shape is often used in parquetry and as decoration on ceramics , silverware and textiles . It also features in heraldry and playing cards .  Symbolism  The lozenge motif dates as far back as the Neolithic and Paleolithic period in Eastern Europe and represents a sown  field and female fertility . 2 The ancient lozenge pattern often shows up in Diamond vault architecture, in traditional dress patterns of Slavic peoples , and in traditional Ukrainian embroidery . The lozenge pattern also appears extensively in Celtic art , art from the Ottoman Empire , and ancient Phrygian art. 3  The lozenge symbolism is one of the main female symbols in Berber carpets. 4 Common Berber jewelry from the Aurès Mountains or Kabylie in Algeria also uses this pattern as a female fertility sign.  In 1658, the English philosopher Sir Thomas Browne published The Garden of Cyrus subtitled The Quincunciall Lozenge, or Network Plantations of the Ancients where he outlined the mystical interconnection of art , nature and the Universe via the quincunx pattern. He suggested that ancient plantations were laid out in a lozenge pattern. 5  Lozenges appear as symbols in ancient classic element systems , in amulets , and in religious symbolism . In a suit of playing cards , diamonds is in the shape of a lozenge.  Encodings  In Unicode , the lozenge is encoded in multiple variants:      6           In IBM 026 punched card code it is ⌑ (12-8-4), 7  DOS  code page 437 (at character code 4) 8 and Mac-Roman . The LaTeX command for the lozenge is \lozenge .  Applications  Modal logic  In modal logic , the lozenge expresses that there is "possibility." For example, the expression    ◆  P      normal-◆  P    \lozenge P   expresses that it is possible that   P   P   P   is true.  Mathematics  In axiomatic set theory , the lozenge refers to the principles known collectively as the diamond principle .  Calculator  On equipment, especially calculators, the lozenge is used to mark the subtotal key. It is standardized in ISO 7000. 9  Camouflage  During the First World War , the Germans developed Lozenge-Tarnung ( lozenge camouflage ). 10 This camouflage was made up of colored polygons of four or five colors. The repeating patterns often used irregular four-, five- and six-sided polygons, but some contained regular rhombi or hexagons. Because painting such a pattern was very time consuming, and the paint added considerably to the weight of the aircraft, the pattern was printed on fabric. This pre-printed fabric was used from 1916 until the end of the war, in various forms and colours.  Heraldry  The lozenge in heraldry is a diamond-shaped charge , usually somewhat narrower than it is tall. A mascle is a voided lozenge—that is, a lozenge with a lozenge-shaped hole in the middle—and the rarer rustre is a lozenge containing a circular hole. A field covered in a pattern of lozenges is described as lozengy ; a similar field of mascles is masculy .  Cough tablets  Cough tablets have taken the name lozenge, based on their original shape. According to the Oxford English Dictionary the first use of this sense was in 1530.  In Finland, the lozenge is associated with salmiak , through Apteekin Salmiakki. Thus, the lozenge is commonly called salmiakkikuvio "salmiak shape". The pattern is often used even if the candy is not actually lozenge-shaped.  U.S. Military  To implement 10 U.S.C 773, the Secretary of the Navy has prescribed the following distinctive mark for wear by members of military societies which are composed entirely of honorably discharged officers and enlisted personnel, or by the instructors and members of duly organized cadet corps.  The distinctive mark will be a diamond, 3-1/2 inches long by two inches wide, of any cloth material. A white distinctive mark will be worn on blue, green, or khaki clothing; and a blue distinctive mark will be worn on white clothing.  The distinctive mark will be worn on all outer clothing on the right sleeve, at the point of the shoulder, the upper tip of the diamond to be 1/4 inch below the shoulder seam.  The lozenge is also used in the U.S. Army , Marine Corps , and Air Force on the insignia of their respective First Sergeants .  They are also used in the Junior ROTC and the Cadet Program in the Civil Air Patrol , for Cadet Officers corresponding to the military pay grades of O-4 to O-6 (C/Major, C/Lieutenant Colonel, and C/Colonel).  Finnish Defence Forces  In Finnish military ranks , the lozenge is found in the insignia of conscript officer students (one lozenge) and conscript officer candidates (two lozenges).  Transportation  The lozenge (technically a mascle ) can be used on public roadways in the United States and Canada to mark a specific lane for a particular use. The lane will usually be painted with a lozenge at a regular interval, and signage will be installed to indicate the restrictions on using the lane. This marking is most often used to denote high-occupancy vehicle lanes or bus lanes , with accompanying signage reading "◊ HOV LANE" or "◊ BUS LANE" and giving the requirements for a vehicle to be accepted. Prior to 17 January 2006, lozenges could also be used to mark bicycle-only lanes, often in conjunction with a bicycle icon. 11 In New Zealand and Japan, a lozenge marked in white paint on the road indicates an upcoming uncontrolled pedestrian crossing.  Flags  Several flags feature lozenges, including the Brazilian flag , which contains a yellow lozenge at the center. One official flag of Bavaria is entirely made of blue and white lozenges.  {{-}}  Imagery  Image:Museum of Anatolian Civilizations068.jpg|Phrygian art, 7th Century BC Image:MotherGoddessFertility.JPG| Cucuteni-Trypillian figurine with sown field pattern Image:Lozenge.jpg| Bush Barrow Lozenge British Bronze Age Image:Antique oushak carpet with a pale red and green tone.jpg| Ushak carpet , Ottoman Empire Image:Yantprapidta.JPG| Khatha , sacred Yantra amulet from Thailand Image:Ashthalakshmi - Star of Laxmi.svg| Hindu  Star of Lakshmi Image:ROUB EL HIZB 06DE.svg| Muslim  Rub el Hizb Image:2152085cab.png| Magic squares were used as amulets Image:Talis02.png| Talisman design from an 18th Century French grimoire Image:Qur'an 4475.jpg| Arabic manuscript China , 16th Century Image:Carolus Magnus denarus Tarvisii.jpg| Charlemagne coins, denier or denaro ca. 771-793 Image:Dish with floral lozenge from the Belitung shipwreck, ArtScience Museum, Singapore - 20110618.jpg| Belitung shipwreck , Tang Dynasty ca.825 Image:Berezhany- (267).jpg|Traditional sown field pattern of Western Ukraine Image:Armenian rug-9 Kazak.jpg| Armenian tapestry Image:RR 02.png| Rongorongo  proto-writing , possible lunar calendar calculating device Image:Epigonation (1911).jpg| Epigonation in Eastern Christianity Image:Four elements representation.svg| Greek  Classical elements Image:COAabbess.png|In Ecclesiastical heraldry  lozenge shape is reserved for females Image:WASPbadge.jpg| Women Airforce Service Pilots Badge Image:Flag of Belarus.svg|National flag of Belarus with sown field pattern Image:Arms of Catherine Middleton.svg| Coat of arms  lozenge shape is reserved for females Image:White d a.svg| Ace of diamonds Image:Peterpaul sfbgewoelbe.JPG| Diamond vault in German architecture Image:Ledringhem-runes.jpg| Rune -shaped designs (five-lozenges cross and heart) on the gable of Ledringhem 's church  See also   Petrosomatoglyph Lozenges as symbols in prehistory.
