Kuratowski's free set theorem

Kuratowski's free set theorem, named after Kazimierz Kuratowski, is a result of set theory, an area of mathematics. It is a result which has been largely forgotten for almost 50 years, but has been applied recently in solving several lattice theory problems, such as the congruence lattice problem.
Denote by 
 
 
 
  the set of all finite subsets of a set 
 
 
 
 . Likewise, for a positive integer

 
 , denote by 
 
 
 
 
  the set of all 
 
 
 
 -elements subsets of 
 
 
 
 . For a mapping

 
 , we say that a subset

 
  of 
 
 
 
 
  is free (with respect to 
 
 
 
 ), if for any 
 
 
 
 -element subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  and any 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 ,. Kuratowski published in 1951 the following result, which characterizes the infinite cardinals of the form 
 
 
 
 .
The theorem states the following. Let 
 
 
 
  be a positive integer and let 
 
 
 
  be a set. Then the cardinality of 
 
 
 
 
  is greater than or equal to 
 
 
 
  if and only if for every mapping 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , there exists an 
 
 
 
 
 -element free subset of 
 
 
 
  with respect to 
 
 
 
 .
For 
 
 
 
 , Kuratowski's free set theorem is superseded by Hajnal's set mapping theorem.
