   Kuratowski's free set theorem      Kuratowski's free set theorem   Kuratowski's free set theorem , named after Kazimierz Kuratowski , is a result of set theory , an area of mathematics . It is a result which has been largely forgotten for almost 50 years, but has been applied recently in solving several lattice theory problems, such as the congruence lattice problem .  Denote by     [  X  ]     <  ω      superscript   delimited-[]  X     absent  ω     [X]^{<\omega}   the set of all finite subsets of a set   X   X   X   . Likewise, for a positive integer    n   n   n   , denote by     [  X  ]   n     superscript   delimited-[]  X   n    [X]^{n}   the set of all   n   n   n   -elements subsets of   X   X   X   . For a mapping     Φ  :     [  X  ]   n   →    [  X  ]     <  ω        normal-:  normal-Φ   normal-→   superscript   delimited-[]  X   n    superscript   delimited-[]  X     absent  ω       \Phi\colon[X]^{n}\to[X]^{<\omega}   , we say that a subset    U   U   U   of   X   X   X   is free (with respect to   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   ), if for any   n   n   n   -element subset   V   V   V   of   U   U   U   and any    u  ∈   U  ∖  V       u    U  V     u\in U\setminus V   ,    u  ∉   Φ   (  V  )        u    normal-Φ  V     u\notin\Phi(V)   ,. Kuratowski published in 1951 the following result, which characterizes the infinite  cardinals of the form    ℵ  n     subscript  normal-ℵ  n    \aleph_{n}   .  The theorem states the following. Let   n   n   n   be a positive integer and let   X   X   X   be a set. Then the cardinality of   X   X   X   is greater than or equal to    ℵ  n     subscript  normal-ℵ  n    \aleph_{n}   if and only if for every mapping   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   from     [  X  ]   n     superscript   delimited-[]  X   n    [X]^{n}   to     [  X  ]     <  ω      superscript   delimited-[]  X     absent  ω     [X]^{<\omega}   , there exists an    (   n  +  1   )      n  1    (n+1)   -element free subset of   X   X   X   with respect to   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   .  For    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   , Kuratowski's free set theorem is superseded by Hajnal's set mapping theorem .  References   P. Erdős , A. Hajnal , A. Máté, R.
