   Hypograph (mathematics)      Hypograph (mathematics)   In mathematics , the hypograph or subgraph of a function  f : R n → R is the set of points lying on or below its graph :       hyp  f   =   {   (  x  ,  μ  )   :    x  ∈   ℝ  n    ,    μ  ∈  ℝ   ,   μ  ≤   f   (  x  )       }   ⊆   ℝ   n  +  1            hyp  f    conditional-set   x  μ    formulae-sequence    x   superscript  ℝ  n     formulae-sequence    μ  ℝ     μ    f  x             superscript  ℝ    n  1       \mbox{hyp}f=\{(x,\mu)\,:\,x\in\mathbb{R}^{n},\,\mu\in\mathbb{R},\,\mu\leq f(x)%
 \}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n+1}     and the strict hypograph of the function is:         hyp  S   f   =   {   (  x  ,  μ  )   :    x  ∈   ℝ  n    ,    μ  ∈  ℝ   ,   μ  <   f   (  x  )       }   ⊆   ℝ   n  +  1     .           subscript  hyp  S   f    conditional-set   x  μ    formulae-sequence    x   superscript  ℝ  n     formulae-sequence    μ  ℝ     μ    f  x             superscript  ℝ    n  1       \mbox{hyp}_{S}f=\{(x,\mu)\,:\,x\in\mathbb{R}^{n},\,\mu\in\mathbb{R},\,\mu     The set is empty if    f  ≡   -  ∞       f        f\equiv-\infty   .  The domain (rather than the co-domain) of the function is not particularly important for this definition; it can be an arbitrary set 1 instead of    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   .  Similarly, the set of points on or above the function's graph is its epigraph .  Properties  A function is concave if and only if its hypograph is a convex set . The hypograph of a real affine function  g : R n → R is a halfspace in R n +1 .  A function is upper semicontinuous if and only if its hypograph is closed .
