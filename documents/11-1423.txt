Acyl-phosphate—hexose phosphotransferase

In enzymology, an acyl-phosphate-hexose phosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acyl phosphate + D-hexose 
 
 
 
  an acid + D-hexose phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl phosphate and D-hexose, whereas its two products are acid and D-hexose phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-phosphate:D-hexose phosphotransferase. This enzyme is also called hexose phosphate:hexose phosphotransferase.
