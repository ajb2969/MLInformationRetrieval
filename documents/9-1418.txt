Specification (regression)

In regression analysis specification is the process of developing a regression model. This process consists of selecting an appropriate functional form for the model and choosing which variables to include. For instance, one may specify the functional relationship 
 
 
 
  between personal income

 
  and human capital in terms of schooling 
 
 
 
 
  and on-the-job experience 
 
 
 
  as:1


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the unexplained residual that is supposed to be independent and identically distributed. If assumptions of the regression model are correct, the least squares estimates of the parameters 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  will be efficient unbiased. Hence specification diagnostics usually involves testing the first to fourth moment of the residuals.2
Specification error and bias
Specification error occurs when an independent variable is correlated with the error term. There are several different causes of specification error:

incorrect functional form
a variable omitted from the model may have a relationship with both the dependent variable and one or more of the independent variables (omitted-variable bias);3
an irrelevant variable may be included in the model
the dependent variable may be part of a system of simultaneous equations (simultaneity bias)
measurement errors may affect the independent variables.

Detection
The Ramsey RESET test can help test for specification error.
