   Specification (regression)      Specification (regression)   In regression analysis  specification is the process of developing a regression model. This process consists of selecting an appropriate functional form for the model and choosing which variables to include. For instance, one may specify the functional relationship    y  =   f   (  s  ,  x  )        y    f   s  x      y=f(s,x)   between personal income    y   y   y   and human capital in terms of schooling   s   s   s   and on-the-job experience   x   x   x   as: 1       ln  y   =    ln   y  0    +   ρ  s   +    β  1   x   +    β  2    x  2    +  ϵ         y        subscript  y  0      ρ  s      subscript  β  1   x      subscript  β  2    superscript  x  2    ϵ     \ln y=\ln y_{0}+\rho s+\beta_{1}x+\beta_{2}x^{2}+\epsilon   where   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   is the unexplained residual that is supposed to be independent and identically distributed . If assumptions of the regression model are correct, the least squares estimates of the parameters   ρ   ρ   \rho   and   β   β   \beta   will be efficient unbiased. Hence specification diagnostics usually involves testing the first to fourth moment of the residuals. 2  Specification error and bias  Specification error occurs when an independent variable is correlated with the error term. There are several different causes of specification error:   incorrect functional form  a variable omitted from the model may have a relationship with both the dependent variable and one or more of the independent variables ( omitted-variable bias ); 3  an irrelevant variable may be included in the model  the dependent variable may be part of a system of simultaneous equations (simultaneity bias)  measurement errors may affect the independent variables.   Detection  The Ramsey RESET test can help test for specification error.
