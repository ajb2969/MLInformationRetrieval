   Barkhausen stability criterion      Barkhausen stability criterion     In electronics , the Barkhausen stability criterion is a mathematical condition to determine when a linear electronic circuit will oscillate . 1 2 3 It was put forth in 1921 by German physicist Heinrich Georg Barkhausen (1881–1956). 4 It is widely used in the design of electronic oscillators , and also in the design of general negative feedback circuits such as op amps , to prevent them from oscillating.  Limitations  Barkhausen's criterion applies to linear circuits with a feedback loop . Therefore it cannot be applied to one port negative resistance active elements like tunnel diode oscillators.  Criterion  It states that if A is the gain of the amplifying element in the circuit and β( j ω) is the transfer function of the feedback path, so β A is the loop gain around the feedback loop of the circuit, the circuit will sustain steady-state oscillations only at frequencies for which:   The loop gain is equal to unity in absolute magnitude, that is,     |   β  A   |   =   1           β  A    1    |\beta A|=1\,   and  The phase shift around the loop is zero or an integer multiple of 2π       ∠  β  A   =   2  π  n    ,   n  ∈   0  ,  1  ,  2  ,   …      .     formulae-sequence      normal-∠  β  A     2  π  n      n   0  1  2  normal-…      \angle\beta A=2\pi n,n\in 0,1,2,\dots\,.      Barkhausen's criterion is a necessary condition for oscillation but not a sufficient condition: some circuits satisfy the criterion but do not oscillate. 5 Similarly, the Nyquist stability criterion also indicates instability but is silent about oscillation. Apparently there is not a compact formulation of an oscillation criterion that is both necessary and sufficient. 6  Erroneous version  Barkhausen's original "formula for self-excitation", intended for determining the oscillation frequencies of the feedback loop, involved an equality sign: |β A | = 1. At the time conditionally-stable nonlinear systems were poorly understood; it was widely believed that this gave the boundary between stability (|β A |  However, stable oscillations only occur at frequencies for which equality holds.
