Cartan pair

In the mathematical fields of Lie theory and algebraic topology, the notion of Cartan pair is a technical condition on the relationship between a reductive Lie algebra

 
  and a subalgebra 
 
 
 
  reductive in 
 
 
 
 .
A reductive pair 
 
 
 
  is said to be Cartan if the relative Lie algebra cohomology


 
  is isomorphic to the tensor product of the characteristic subalgebra


 
  and an exterior subalgebra 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , where



 
 , the Samelson subspace, are those primitive elements in the kernel of the composition 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  is the primitive subspace of 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  is the transgression,
and the map 
 
 
 
  of symmetric algebras is induced by the restriction map of dual vector spaces 
 
 
 
 .

On the level of Lie groups, if G is a compact, connected Lie group and K a closed connected subgroup, there are natural fiber bundles


 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the homotopy quotient, here homotopy equivalent to the regular quotient, and


 
 . Then the characteristic algebra is the image of 
 
 
 
 , the transgression 
 
 
 
  from the primitive subspace P of 
 
 
 
  is that arising from the edge maps in the Serre spectral sequence of the universal bundle

 
 , and the subspace 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is the kernel of 
 
 
 
 .
