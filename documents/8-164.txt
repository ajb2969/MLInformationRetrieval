   Martingale pricing      Martingale pricing   Martingale pricing is a pricing approach based on the notions of martingale and risk neutrality . The martingale pricing approach is a cornerstone of modern quantitative finance and can be applied to a variety of derivatives contracts, e.g. options , futures , interest rate derivatives , credit derivatives , etc.  In contrast to the PDE approach to pricing, martingale pricing formulae are in the form of expectations which can be efficiently solved numerically using a Monte Carlo approach. As such, Martingale pricing is preferred when valuing high-dimensional contracts such as a basket of options. On the other hand, valuing American-style contracts is troublesome and requires discretizing the problem (making it like a Bermudan option ) and only in 2001 F. A. Longstaff and E. S. Schwartz developed a practical Monte Carlo method for pricing American options. 1  Measure theory representation  Suppose the state of the market can be represented by the filtered  probability space ,    (  Œ©  ,    (   ‚Ñ±  t   )    t  ‚àà   [  0  ,  T  ]     ,   ‚Ñô  ~   )     normal-Œ©   subscript   subscript  ‚Ñ±  t     t   0  T      normal-~  ‚Ñô     (\Omega,(\mathcal{F}_{t})_{t\in[0,T]},\tilde{\mathbb{P}})   . Let     {   S   (  t  )    }    t  ‚àà   [  0  ,  T  ]       subscript     S  t      t   0  T      \{S(t)\}_{t\in[0,T]}   be a stochastic price process on this space. One may price a derivative security,    V   (  t  ,   S   (  t  )    )       V   t    S  t      V(t,S(t))   under the philosophy of no arbitrage as,       D   (  t  )   V   (  t  ,  S   (  t  )   )   =   ùîº  ~    [  D   (  T  )   V   (  T  ,  S   (  T  )   )   |   ‚Ñ±  t   ]   ,  d  D   (  t  )   =  -  r   (  t  )   D   (  t  )   d  t     fragments  D   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)   V   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-,  S   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)   normal-)     normal-~  ùîº    fragments  normal-[  D   fragments  normal-(  T  normal-)   V   fragments  normal-(  T  normal-,  S   fragments  normal-(  T  normal-)   normal-)   normal-|   subscript  ‚Ñ±  t   normal-]   normal-,  d  D   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)     r   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)   D   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)   d  t    D(t)V(t,S(t))=\tilde{\mathbb{E}}[D(T)V(T,S(T))|\mathcal{F}_{t}],\qquad dD(t)=-%
 r(t)D(t)\ dt      where    ‚Ñô  ~     normal-~  ‚Ñô    \tilde{\mathbb{P}}   is the risk-neutral measure .       (   r   (  t  )    )    t  ‚àà   [  0  ,  T  ]       subscript    r  t     t   0  T      (r(t))_{t\in[0,T]}   is an    ‚Ñ±  t     subscript  ‚Ñ±  t    \mathcal{F}_{t}   -measurable (risk-free, possibly stochastic) interest rate process.  This is accomplished through almost sure replication of the derivative's time   T   T   T   payoff using only underlying securities, and the risk-free money market (MMA). These underlyings have prices that are observable and known. Specifically, one constructs a portfolio process     {   X   (  t  )    }    t  ‚àà   [  0  ,  T  ]       subscript     X  t      t   0  T      \{X(t)\}_{t\in[0,T]}   in continuous time, where he holds    Œî   (  t  )       normal-Œî  t    \Delta(t)   shares of the underlying stock at each time   t   t   t   , and     X   (  t  )    -   Œî   (  t  )   S   (  t  )          X  t     normal-Œî  t  S  t     X(t)-\Delta(t)S(t)   cash earning the risk-free rate    r   (  t  )       r  t    r(t)   . The portfolio obeys the stochastic differential equation       d  X   (  t  )    =    Œî   (  t  )   d  S   (  t  )    +   r   (  t  )    (    X   (  t  )    -   Œî   (  t  )   S   (  t  )     )   d  t          d  X  t       normal-Œî  t  d  S  t     r  t      X  t     normal-Œî  t  S  t    d  t      dX(t)=\Delta(t)\ dS(t)+r(t)(X(t)-\Delta(t)S(t))\ dt     One will then attempt to apply Girsanov theorem by first computing     d   ‚Ñô  ~     d  ‚Ñô         d   normal-~  ‚Ñô      d  ‚Ñô     \frac{d\tilde{\mathbb{P}}}{d\mathbb{P}}   ; that is, the Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative with respect to the observed market probability distribution. This ensures that the discounted replicating portfolio process is a Martingale under risk neutral conditions.  If such a process    Œî   (  t  )       normal-Œî  t    \Delta(t)   can be well-defined and constructed, then choosing     V   (  0  ,   S   (  0  )    )    =   X   (  0  )          V   0    S  0       X  0     V(0,S(0))=X(0)   will result in     ‚Ñô  ~    [  X   (  T  )   =  V   (  T  )   ]   =  1     fragments   normal-~  ‚Ñô    fragments  normal-[  X   fragments  normal-(  T  normal-)    V   fragments  normal-(  T  normal-)   normal-]    1    \tilde{\mathbb{P}}[X(T)=V(T)]=1   , which immediately implies that this happens   ‚Ñô   ‚Ñô   \mathbb{P}   - almost surely as well, since the two measures are equivalent.
