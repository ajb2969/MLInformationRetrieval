Logarithmic distribution

In probability and statistics, the logarithmic distribution (also known as the logarithmic series distribution or the log-series distribution) is a discrete probability distribution derived from the Maclaurin series expansion



From this we obtain the identity



This leads directly to the probability mass function of a Log(p)-distributed random variable:



for k ≥ 1, and where 0  F(k) = 1 + \frac{\Beta(p; k+1,0)}{\ln(1-p)}
where B is the incomplete beta function.
A Poisson compounded with Log(p)-distributed random variables has a negative binomial distribution. In other words, if N is a random variable with a Poisson distribution, and Xi, i = 1, 2, 3, ... is an infinite sequence of independent identically distributed random variables each having a Log(p) distribution, then


 
  has a negative binomial distribution. In this way, the negative binomial distribution is seen to be a compound Poisson distribution.
R. A. Fisher described the logarithmic distribution in a paper that used it to model relative species abundance.1
The probability mass function ƒ of this distribution satisfies the recurrence relation
