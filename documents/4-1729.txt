   Logarithmic distribution      Logarithmic distribution   In probability and statistics , the logarithmic distribution (also known as the logarithmic series distribution or the log-series distribution ) is a discrete probability distribution derived from the Maclaurin series expansion        -   ln   (   1  -  p   )     =   p  +    p  2   2   +    p  3   3   +  ⋯    .            1  p       p     superscript  p  2   2      superscript  p  3   3   normal-⋯     -\ln(1-p)=p+\frac{p^{2}}{2}+\frac{p^{3}}{3}+\cdots.     From this we obtain the identity        ∑   k  =  1   ∞       -  1    ln   (   1  -  p   )        p  k   k     =  1.        superscript   subscript     k  1            1       1  p        superscript  p  k   k     1.    \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{-1}{\ln(1-p)}\;\frac{p^{k}}{k}=1.     This leads directly to the probability mass function of a Log( p )-distributed random variable :       f   (  k  )    =      -  1    ln   (   1  -  p   )        p  k   k          f  k         1       1  p        superscript  p  k   k      f(k)=\frac{-1}{\ln(1-p)}\;\frac{p^{k}}{k}     for k ≥ 1, and where 0  F(k) = 1 + \frac{\Beta(p; k+1,0)}{\ln(1-p)}  where B is the incomplete beta function .  A Poisson compounded with Log( p )-distributed random variables has a negative binomial distribution . In other words, if N is a random variable with a Poisson distribution , and X i , i = 1, 2, 3, ... is an infinite sequence of independent identically distributed random variables each having a Log( p ) distribution, then       ∑   i  =  1   N    X  i       superscript   subscript     i  1    N    subscript  X  i     \sum_{i=1}^{N}X_{i}   has a negative binomial distribution. In this way, the negative binomial distribution is seen to be a compound Poisson distribution .  R. A. Fisher described the logarithmic distribution in a paper that used it to model relative species abundance . 1  The probability mass function ƒ of this distribution satisfies the recurrence relation         f   (   k  +  1   )    =     k  p    k  +  1    f   (  k  )     ;    with the initial value  f   (  1  )    =    -  p    ln   (   1  -  p   )       .     formulae-sequence      f    k  1          k  p     k  1    f  k        with the initial value  f  1       p       1  p        f(k+1)=\frac{kp}{k+1}f(k);\text{ with the initial value }f(1)=\frac{-p}{\ln(1-%
