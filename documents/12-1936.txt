   Fourier division      Fourier division   Fourier division or cross division is a pencil-and-paper method of division which helps to simplify the process when the divisor has more than two digits. It was invented by Joseph Fourier .  Method  The following exposition assumes that the numbers are broken into two-digit pieces, separated by commas: e.g. 3456 becomes 34,56. In general x,y denotes x ·100 + y and x,y,z denotes x ·10000 + y ·100 + z , etc.  Suppose that we wish to divide c by a , to obtain the result b . (So a × b = c .)        c  a   =     c  1   ,   c  2   ,   c  3   ,   c  4   ,    c  5   …      a  1   ,   a  2   ,   a  3   ,   a  4   ,    a  5   …     =   b  1    ,     b  2   ,   b  3   ,   b  4   ,    b  5   …    =  b      formulae-sequence        c  a       subscript  c  1    subscript  c  2    subscript  c  3    subscript  c  4      subscript  c  5   normal-…      subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2    subscript  a  3    subscript  a  4      subscript  a  5   normal-…           subscript  b  1         subscript  b  2    subscript  b  3    subscript  b  4      subscript  b  5   normal-…    b     \frac{c}{a}=\frac{c_{1},c_{2},c_{3},c_{4},c_{5}\dots}{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},a_{4},%
 a_{5}\dots}=b_{1},b_{2},b_{3},b_{4},b_{5}\dots=b     Note that a 1 may not have a leading zero; it should stand alone as a two-digit number.  We can find the successive terms b 1 , b 2 , etc., using the following formulae:       b  1   =      c  1   ,   c  2     a  1    with remainder   r  1         subscript  b  1         subscript  c  1    subscript  c  2     subscript  a  1    with remainder   subscript  r  1      b_{1}=\frac{c_{1},c_{2}}{a_{1}}\mbox{ with remainder }r_{1}          b  2   =      r  1   ,    c  3   -    b  1   ×   a  2       a  1    with remainder   r  2         subscript  b  2         subscript  r  1      subscript  c  3      subscript  b  1    subscript  a  2       subscript  a  1    with remainder   subscript  r  2      b_{2}=\frac{r_{1},c_{3}-b_{1}\times a_{2}}{a_{1}}\mbox{ with remainder }r_{2}          b  3   =      r  2   ,    c  4   -    b  2   ×   a  2    -    b  1   ×   a  3       a  1    with remainder   r  3         subscript  b  3         subscript  r  2      subscript  c  4      subscript  b  2    subscript  a  2       subscript  b  1    subscript  a  3       subscript  a  1    with remainder   subscript  r  3      b_{3}=\frac{r_{2},c_{4}-b_{2}\times a_{2}-b_{1}\times a_{3}}{a_{1}}\mbox{ with%
  remainder }r_{3}          b  4   =      r  3   ,    c  5   -    b  3   ×   a  2    -    b  2   ×   a  3    -    b  1   ×   a  4       a  1    with remainder   r  4   …        subscript  b  4         subscript  r  3      subscript  c  5      subscript  b  3    subscript  a  2       subscript  b  2    subscript  a  3       subscript  b  1    subscript  a  4       subscript  a  1    with remainder   subscript  r  4   normal-…     b_{4}=\frac{r_{3},c_{5}-b_{3}\times a_{2}-b_{2}\times a_{3}-b_{1}\times a_{4}}%
 {a_{1}}\mbox{ with remainder }r_{4}\dots     Each time we add a term to the numerator until it has as many terms as a . From then on, the number of terms remains constant, so there is no increase in difficulty. Once we have as much precision as we need, we use an estimate to place the decimal point.  It will often be the case that one of the b terms will be negative. For example, 93,−12 denotes 9288, while −16,32 denotes −1600 + 32 or −1568. (Note: 45,−16,32 denotes 448432.) Care must be taken with the signs of the remainders also.  The general term is       b  i   =      r   i  -  1    ,    c   i  +  1    -    ∑   j  =  2   i     b    i  -  j   +  1    ×   a  j        a  1    with remainder   r  i         subscript  b  i         subscript  r    i  1       subscript  c    i  1      superscript   subscript     j  2    i      subscript  b      i  j   1     subscript  a  j        subscript  a  1    with remainder   subscript  r  i      b_{i}=\frac{r_{i-1},c_{i+1}-\textstyle\sum_{j=2}^{i}b_{i-j+1}\times a_{j}}{a_{%

Instead, each term, starting with     b  1   ,     subscript  b  1    b_{1},   should be multiplied by 100, and the next term added (or, if negative, subtracted). This result should be multiplied by 100, and the next term added or subtracted, etc., until all terms are exhausted. In other words, we construct partial sums of the b terms:       B  1   =   b  1        subscript  B  1    subscript  b  1     B_{1}=b_{1}          B  i   =    100   b   i  -  1     +   b  i         subscript  B  i       100   subscript  b    i  1      subscript  b  i      B_{i}=100b_{i-1}+b_{i}     The last partial sum is the value for b .
