   Interior product      Interior product   In mathematics , the interior product or interior derivative is a degree −1 antiderivation on the exterior algebra of differential forms on a smooth manifold . The interior product, named in opposition to the exterior product , is also called interior or inner multiplication, or the inner derivative or derivation, but should not be confused with an inner product . The interior product ι X ω is sometimes written as X  ω . 1  Definition  The interior product is defined to be the contraction of a differential form with a vector field . Thus if X is a vector field on the manifold  M , then       ι  X   :     Ω  p    (  M  )    →    Ω   p  -  1     (  M  )        normal-:   subscript  ι  X    normal-→     superscript  normal-Ω  p   M      superscript  normal-Ω    p  1    M      \iota_{X}\colon\Omega^{p}(M)\to\Omega^{p-1}(M)   is the map which sends a p -form ω to the ( p −1)-form ι X ω defined by the property that        (    ι  X   ω   )    (   X  1   ,  …  ,   X   p  -  1    )    =   ω   (  X  ,   X  1   ,  …  ,   X   p  -  1    )             subscript  ι  X   ω     subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X    p  1        ω   X   subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X    p  1        (\iota_{X}\omega)(X_{1},\ldots,X_{p-1})=\omega(X,X_{1},\ldots,X_{p-1})   for any vector fields X 1 , ..., X p −1 .  The interior product is the unique antiderivation of degree −1 on the exterior algebra such that on one-forms α        ι  X   α   =   α   (  X  )    =   ⟨  α  ,  X  ⟩            subscript  ι  X   α     α  X         α  X      \displaystyle\iota_{X}\alpha=\alpha(X)=\langle\alpha,X\rangle   , the duality pairing between α and the vector X . Explicitly, if β is a p -form and γ is a q -form, then         ι  X    (   β  ∧  γ   )    =      (    ι  X   β   )   ∧  γ   +     (   -  1   )   p   β    ∧   (    ι  X   γ   )     .         subscript  ι  X     β  γ             subscript  ι  X   β   γ      superscript    1   p   β       subscript  ι  X   γ      \iota_{X}(\beta\wedge\gamma)=(\iota_{X}\beta)\wedge\gamma+(-1)^{p}\beta\wedge(%
 \iota_{X}\gamma).   The above relation says that the interior product obeys a graded Leibniz rule . An operation equipped with linearity and a Leibniz rule is often called a derivative.  Properties  By antisymmetry of forms,        ι  X    ι  Y   ω   =   -    ι  Y    ι  X   ω           subscript  ι  X    subscript  ι  Y   ω        subscript  ι  Y    subscript  ι  X   ω      \iota_{X}\iota_{Y}\omega=-\iota_{Y}\iota_{X}\omega     and so     ι  X  2   =  0       superscript   subscript  ι  X   2   0    \iota_{X}^{2}=0   . This may be compared to the exterior derivative  d , which has the property . The interior product relates the exterior derivative and Lie derivative of differential forms by Cartan's identity :         ℒ  X   ω   =    d   (    ι  X   ω   )    +    ι  X   d  ω     .         subscript  ℒ  X   ω       normal-d     subscript  ι  X   ω       subscript  ι  X   normal-d  ω      \mathcal{L}_{X}\omega=\mathrm{d}(\iota_{X}\omega)+\iota_{X}\mathrm{d}\omega.   This identity defines a duality between the exterior and interior derivatives. Cartan's identity is important in symplectic geometry and general relativity : see moment map . The interior product with respect to the commutator of two vector fields   X   X   X   ,   Y   Y   Y   satisfies the identity        ι   [  X  ,  Y  ]    =   [   ℒ  X   ,   ι  Y   ]    .       subscript  ι   X  Y      subscript  ℒ  X    subscript  ι  Y      \iota_{[X,Y]}=\left[\mathcal{L}_{X},\iota_{Y}\right].
