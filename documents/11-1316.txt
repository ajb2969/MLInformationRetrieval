Maltose synthase




Maltose synthase

In enzymology, a maltose synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2 alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  maltose + 2 phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are maltose and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate:alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate 4-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase (dephosphorylating).
