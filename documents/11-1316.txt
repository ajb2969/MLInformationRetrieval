   Maltose synthase      Maltose synthase   In enzymology , a maltose synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   maltose + 2 phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are maltose and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate:alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate 4-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase (dephosphorylating) .
