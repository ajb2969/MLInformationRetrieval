Double vector bundle

In mathematics, a double vector bundle is the combination of two compatible vector bundle structures, which contains in particular the double tangent 
 
 
 
  of a vector bundle 
 
 
 
  and the double tangent bundle

 
 .
Definition and first consequences
A double vector bundle consists of 
 
 
 
 
 , where

the side bundles

 
  and 
 
 
 
  are vector bundles over the base 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  is a vector bundle on both side bundles 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ,
the projection, the addition, the scalar multiplication and the zero map on E for both vector bundle structures are morphisms.

Double vector bundle morphism
A double vector bundle morphism (f_E, f_H, f_V, f_B) consists of maps 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is a bundle morphism from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a bundle morphism from 
 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a bundle morphism from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  is a bundle morphism from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .
The 'flip of the double vector bundle 
 
 
 
  is the double vector bundle 
 
 
 
 .
Examples
If 
 
 
 
 
  is a vector bundle over a differentiable manifold 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is a double vector bundle when considering its secondary vector bundle structure.
If 
 
 
 
  is a differentiable manifold, then its double tangent bundle

 
  is a double vector bundle.
