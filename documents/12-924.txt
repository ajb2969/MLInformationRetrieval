Shapiro's lemma
In [[mathematics]], especially in the areas of [[abstract algebra]] dealing with [[group cohomology]] or relative homological algebra, '''Shapiro's lemma''', als
 o known as the Eckmann–Shapiro lemma, relates extensions of modules over one ring to extensions over another, especially the group ring of a group and of a subgroup. It thus relates the group cohomology with respect to a group to the cohomology with respect to a subgroup. Shapiro's lemma is named after Arnold Shapiro, who proved it in 1961;1 however, Beno Eckmann had discovered it earlier, in 1953.2
Statement for rings
Let R → S be a ring homomorphism, so that S becomes a left and right R-module. Let M be a left S-module and N a left R-module. By restriction of scalars, M is also a left R-module.

If S is projective as a right R-module, then:





If S is projective as a left R-module, then:




See . The projectivity conditions can be weakened into conditions on the vanishing of certain Tor- or Ext-groups: see .
Statement for group rings
When H is a subgroup of finite index in G, then the group ring R[G] is finitely generated projective as a left and right R[H] module, so the previous applies in a simple way. Let M be a finite-dimensional representation of G and N a finite-dimensional representation of H. In this case, the module S ⊗R N is called the induced representation of N from H to G, and RM is called the restricted representation of M from G to H. One has that:



When n = 0, this is called Frobenius reciprocity for completely reducible modules, and Nakayama reciprocity in general. See , which also contains these higher versions of the Mackey decomposition.
Statement for group cohomology
Specializing M to be the trivial module produces the familiar Shapiro's lemma. Let H be a subgroup of G and N a representation of H. For NG the induced representation of N from H to G using the tensor product, and for H* the group homology:

H*(G, NG) = H*(H, N)
 

Similarly, for NG the co-induced representation of N from H to G using the Hom functor, and for H* the group cohomology:

H*(G, NG) = H*(H, N)
 

When H is finite index in G, then the induced and coinduced representations coincide and the lemma is valid for both homology and cohomology.
