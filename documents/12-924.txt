   Shapiro's lemma      Shapiro's lemma  In [[mathematics]], especially in the areas of [[abstract algebra]] dealing with [[group cohomology]] or relative homological algebra, '''Shapiro's lemma''', als o known as the Eckmann–Shapiro lemma , relates extensions of modules over one ring to extensions over another, especially the group ring of a group and of a subgroup . It thus relates the group cohomology with respect to a group to the cohomology with respect to a subgroup. Shapiro's lemma is named after Arnold Shapiro, who proved it in 1961; 1 however, Beno Eckmann had discovered it earlier, in 1953. 2  Statement for rings  Let R → S be a ring homomorphism , so that S becomes a left and right R -module. Let M be a left S -module and N a left R -module. By restriction of scalars, M is also a left R -module.   If S is projective as a right R -module, then:         Ext  R  n    (  N  ,   M   R    )    ≅    Ext  S  n    (   S   ⊗  R   N   ,  M  )          subscript   superscript  Ext  n   R   N   subscript  M  R      subscript   superscript  Ext  n   S     subscript  tensor-product  R   S  N   M     \operatorname{Ext}^{n}_{R}(N,{}_{R}M)\cong\operatorname{Ext}^{n}_{S}(S\otimes_%
 {R}N,M)      If S is projective as a left R -module, then:         Ext  R  n    (   M   R    ,  N  )    ≅    Ext  S  n    (  M  ,    Hom  R    (  S  ,  N  )    )          subscript   superscript  Ext  n   R    subscript  M  R   N     subscript   superscript  Ext  n   S   M    subscript  Hom  R   S  N      \operatorname{Ext}^{n}_{R}({}_{R}M,N)\cong\operatorname{Ext}^{n}_{S}(M,%
 \operatorname{Hom}_{R}(S,N))     See . The projectivity conditions can be weakened into conditions on the vanishing of certain Tor- or Ext-groups: see .  Statement for group rings  When H is a subgroup of finite index in G , then the group ring R [ G ] is finitely generated projective as a left and right R [ H ] module, so the previous applies in a simple way. Let M be a finite-dimensional representation of G and N a finite-dimensional representation of H . In this case, the module S ⊗ R  N is called the induced representation of N from H to G , and R M is called the restricted representation of M from G to H . One has that:       Ext  G  n    (  M  ,  N   ↑  H  G   )   ≅   Ext  H  n    (  M   ↓  H  G   ,  N  )      fragments   subscript   superscript  Ext  n   G    fragments  normal-(  M  normal-,  N   superscript   subscript  normal-↑  H   G   normal-)     subscript   superscript  Ext  n   H    fragments  normal-(  M   superscript   subscript  normal-↓  H   G   normal-,  N  normal-)     \operatorname{Ext}^{n}_{G}(M,N\uparrow_{H}^{G})\cong\operatorname{Ext}^{n}_{H}%
 (M\downarrow_{H}^{G},N)     When n = 0, this is called Frobenius reciprocity for completely reducible modules, and Nakayama reciprocity in general. See , which also contains these higher versions of the Mackey decomposition.  Statement for group cohomology  Specializing M to be the trivial module produces the familiar Shapiro's lemma. Let H be a subgroup of G and N a representation of H . For N G the induced representation of N from H to G using the tensor product , and for H * the group homology :   H * ( G , N G ) = H * ( H , N )   Similarly, for N G the co-induced representation of N from H to G using the Hom functor , and for H * the group cohomology :   H * ( G , N G ) = H * ( H , N )   When H is finite index in G , then the induced and coinduced representations coincide and the lemma is valid for both homology and cohomology.
