   Ramanujan prime      Ramanujan prime   In mathematics , a Ramanujan prime is a prime number that satisfies a result proven by Srinivasa Ramanujan relating to the prime-counting function .  Origins and definition  In 1919, Ramanujan published a new proof of Bertrand's postulate which, as he notes, was first proved by Chebyshev . 1 At the end of the two-page published paper, Ramanujan derived a generalized result, and that is:       π   (  x  )    -   π   (   x  /  2   )          π  x     π    x  2      \pi(x)-\pi(x/2)   ≥ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... for all x ≥ 2, 11, 17, 29, 41, ...  respectively,  where    π   (  x  )       π  x    \pi(x)   is the prime-counting function , equal to the number of primes less than or equal to x .  The converse of this result is the definition of Ramanujan primes:   The n th Ramanujan prime is the least integer R n for which     π   (  x  )    -   π   (   x  /  2   )          π  x     π    x  2      \pi(x)-\pi(x/2)   ≥ n , for all x ≥ R n . 2    The first five Ramanujan primes are thus 2, 11, 17, 29, and 41. Equivalently,   Ramanujan primes are the least integers R n for which there are at least n primes between x and x /2 for all x ≥ R n .   Note that the integer R n is necessarily a prime number     π   (  x  )    -   π   (   x  /  2   )          π  x     π    x  2      \pi(x)-\pi(x/2)   and, hence,    π   (  x  )       π  x    \pi(x)   must increase by obtaining another prime at x = R n . Since     π   (  x  )    -   π   (   x  /  2   )          π  x     π    x  2      \pi(x)-\pi(x/2)   can increase by at most 1,      π  (     fragments  π  normal-(    \pi(    R n     )  -  π  (     fragments  normal-)   π  normal-(    )-\pi(    R n     /  2  )  =  n     fragments   2  normal-)   n    /2)=n   .  Bounds and an asymptotic formula  For all n ≥ 1, the bounds   2 n ln 2 n n'' < 4 n ln 4 n    hold. If n > 1, then also   p 2 n n'' 3 n    where p n is the n th prime number.  As n tends to infinity, R n is asymptotic to the 2 n th prime, i.e.,   R n ~ p 2 n ( n → ∞).   All these results were proved by Sondow (2009), 3 except for the upper bound R n 3 n which was conjectured by him and proved by Laishram (2010). 4 The bound was improved by Sondow, Nicholson, and Noe (2011) 5 to       R  n   ≤     41  47     p   3  n          subscript  R  n       41  47    subscript  p    3  n       R_{n}\leq\frac{41}{47}\ p_{3n}     which is the optimal form of R n 3 n since it is an equality for n = 5.  In a different direction, Axler 6 showed that       R  n   <   p   ⌈   t  ⋅  n   ⌉         subscript  R  n    subscript  p     normal-⋅  t  n       R_{n}     is optimal for t > 48/19, where    ⌈  ⋅  ⌉      normal-⋅    \lceil\cdot\rceil   is the ceiling function .  Generalized Ramanujan primes  Given a constant c between 0 and 1, the n th c -Ramanujan prime is defined as the smallest integer R c,n with the property that for any integer x ≥ R c,n there are at least n primes between cx and x , that is,      π   (  x  )    -   π   (   c  x   )     ≥  n          π  x     π    c  x     n    \pi(x)-\pi(cx)\geq n   . In particular, when c = 1/2, the n th 1/2-Ramanujan prime is equal to the n th Ramanujan prime: R 0.5, n = R n .  For c = 1/4 and 3/4, the sequence of c -Ramanujan primes begins   R 0.25, n = 2, 3, 5, 13, 17, ... ,    R 0.75, n = 11, 29, 59, 67, 101, ... .   It is known 7 that, for all n and c , the n th c -Ramanujan prime R c,n exists and is indeed prime. Also, as n tends to infinity, R c,n is asymptotic to p n /(1 − c )   R c , n ~ p n /(1 − c ) ( n → ∞)   where p n /(1 − c ) is the   ⌊   normal-⌊   \lfloor    n /(1 − c )   ⌋   normal-⌋   \rfloor   th prime and    ⌊  .  ⌋     fragments  normal-⌊  normal-.  normal-⌋    \lfloor.\rfloor   is the floor function.  Ramanujan prime corollary        2   p   i  -  n     >    p  i   for  i   >   k  where  k   =   π   (   p  k   )    =   π   (   R  n   )     ,          2   subscript  p    i  n        subscript  p  i   for  i          k  where  k          π   subscript  p  k           π   subscript  R  n       2p_{i-n}>p_{i}\text{ for }i>k\text{ where }k=\pi(p_{k})=\pi(R_{n})\,,     i.e. p k is the k th prime and the n th Ramanujan prime.  This is very useful in showing the number of primes in the range [p k , 2*p i-n ] is greater than or equal to 1. By taking into account the size of the gaps between primes in [ p i − n , p k ], one can see that the average prime gap is about ln( p k ) using the following R n /(2 n ) ~ ln( R n ).  Proof of Corollary:  If p i > R n , then p i is odd and p i − 1 ≥ R n , and hence π ( p i − 1) − π ( p i /2) = π ( p i − 1) − π (( p i − 1)/2) ≥ n . Thus p i − 1 ≥ p i −1 > p i −2 > p i −3 > ... > p i − n > p i /2, and so 2 p i − n > p i .  An example of this corollary:  With n = 1000, R n = p k = 19403, and k = 2197, therefore i ≥ 2198 and i − n ≥ 1198. The smallest i − n prime is p i − n = 9719, therefore 2 p i − n = 2 × 9719 = 19438. The 2198th prime, p i , is between p k = 19403 and 2 p i − n = 19438 and is 19417.  The left side of the Ramanujan Prime Corollary is the ; the smallest prime on the right side is . The sequence  is the range of the smallest prime greater than p k . The values of    π   (   R  n   )       π   subscript  R  n     \pi(R_{n})\,   are in the .  The Ramanujan Prime Corollary is due to John Nicholson.  Srinivasan's Lemma 8 states that p k - n  k /2 if R n = p k and n > 1. Proof: By the minimality of R n , the interval ( p k /2, p k ] contains exactly n primes and hence p k - n  k /2.
