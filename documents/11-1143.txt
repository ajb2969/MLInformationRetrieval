   Pythagorean addition      Pythagorean addition   In mathematics , Pythagorean addition is the following binary operation on the real numbers :        a  ⊕  b   =     a  2   +   b  2      .       direct-sum  a  b        superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2       a\oplus b=\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}.   The name recalls the Pythagorean theorem , which states that the length of the hypotenuseof a right triangle is  where a and b are the lengths of the other sides.  This operation provides a simple notation and terminology when the summands are complicated; for example, the energy-momentum relation in physics becomes       E  =    m   c  2    ⊕   p  c     .      E   direct-sum    m   superscript  c  2      p  c      E=mc^{2}\oplus pc.     Properties  The operation ⊕ is associative and commutative, and         x  1  2   +   x  2  2   +  ⋯  +   x  n  2     =    x  1   ⊕   x  2   ⊕  ⋯  ⊕   x  n             superscript   subscript  x  1   2    superscript   subscript  x  2   2   normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  x  n   2      direct-sum   subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-⋯   subscript  x  n      \sqrt{x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\cdots+x_{n}^{2}}=x_{1}\oplus x_{2}\oplus\cdots%
 \oplus x_{n}   . This is enough to form the real numbers into a commutative  semigroup . However, ⊕ is not a group operation for the following reasons.  The only element which could potentially act as an identity element is 0, since an identity e must satisfy e ⊕ e = e . This yields the equation      2   e   =  e          2   e   e    \sqrt{2}e=e   , but if e is nonzero that implies     2   =  1        2   1    \sqrt{2}=1   , so e could only be zero. Unfortunately 0 does not work as an identity element after all, since 0⊕(−1) = 1. This does indicate, however, that if the operation ⊕ is restricted to nonnegative real numbers, then 0 does act as an identity. Consequently the operation ⊕ acting on the nonnegative real numbers forms a commutative monoid .
