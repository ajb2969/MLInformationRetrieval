Pythagorean addition

In mathematics, Pythagorean addition is the following binary operation on the real numbers:


 
  The name recalls the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the length of the hypotenuseof a right triangle is  where a and b are the lengths of the other sides.
This operation provides a simple notation and terminology when the summands are complicated; for example, the energy-momentum relation in physics becomes



Properties
The operation ⊕ is associative and commutative, and


 
 . This is enough to form the real numbers into a commutative semigroup. However, ⊕ is not a group operation for the following reasons.
The only element which could potentially act as an identity element is 0, since an identity e must satisfy e⊕e = e. This yields the equation 
 
 
 
 
 , but if e is nonzero that implies 
 
 
 
 , so e could only be zero. Unfortunately 0 does not work as an identity element after all, since 0⊕(−1) = 1. This does indicate, however, that if the operation ⊕ is restricted to nonnegative real numbers, then 0 does act as an identity. Consequently the operation ⊕ acting on the nonnegative real numbers forms a commutative monoid.
