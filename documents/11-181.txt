Carboxymethyloxysuccinate lyase




Carboxymethyloxysuccinate lyase

In enzymology, a carboxymethyloxysuccinate lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

carboxymethyloxysuccinate 
 
 
 
  fumarate + glycolate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, carboxymethyloxysuccinate, and two products, fumarate and glycolate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the "catch-all" class of lyases that cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is carboxymethyloxysuccinate glycolate-lyase (fumarate-forming). Other names in common use include carbon-oxygen lyase, and carboxymethyloxysuccinate glycolate-lyase.
