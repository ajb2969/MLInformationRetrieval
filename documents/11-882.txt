   Deacetylcephalosporin-C acetyltransferase      Deacetylcephalosporin-C acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a deacetylcephalosporin-C acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + deacetylcephalosporin C   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + cephalosporin C   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and deacetylcephalosporin C , whereas its two products are CoA and cephalosporin C .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:deacetylcephalosporin-C O-acetyltransferase . Other names in common use include acetyl-CoA:deacetylcephalosporin-C acetyltransferase , DAC acetyltransferase , cefG , deacetylcephalosporin C acetyltransferase , acetyl coenzyme A:DAC acetyltransferase , acetyl-CoA:DAC acetyltransferase , CPC acetylhydrolase , acetyl-CoA:DAC O-acetyltransferase , and DAC-AT . This enzyme participates in penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis .  References          "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
