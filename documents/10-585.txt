   Methanol dehydrogenase      Methanol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a methanol dehydrogenase is an enzyme that catalyses the chemical reaction:   methanol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   formaldehyde + 2 electrons + 2H +    How the electrons are captured and transported depends upon the kind of methanol dehydrogenase and there are two main types. A common electron acceptor in biological systems is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) and some enzymes use a related molecule called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP + ). An NAD + -dependent methanol dehydrogenase() was first reported in a Gram-positive methylotroph 1 and is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   methanol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   formaldehyde + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are methanol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are formaldehyde , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is methanol:NAD + oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in methane metabolism .  Prior to the discovery of this enzyme, methanol oxidation in Gram-negative bacteria had been shown to be by way of an (NAD + ) independent alcohol dehydrogenase found originally in Pseudomonas M27. This enzyme (EC. 1.1.99.8) contains a prosthetic group called Pyrrolo Quinoline Quinone (PQQ) that accepts the electrons generated from methanol oxidation and passes these electrons to cytochrome c. 2  References  Further reading     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure     ↩  ↩
