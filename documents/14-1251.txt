   Alvis–Curtis duality      Alvis–Curtis duality   In mathematics , Alvis–Curtis duality is a duality operation on the characters of a reductive group over a finite field , introduced by  and studied by his student .  introduced a similar duality operation for Lie algebras.  Alvis–Curtis duality has order 2 and is an isometry on generalized characters.  discusses Alvis–Curtis duality in detail.  Definition  The dual ζ* of a character ζ of a finite group G with a split BN-pair is defined to be       ζ  *   =    ∑   J  ⊆  R       (   -  1   )   J    ζ   P  J   G          superscript  ζ      subscript     J  R       superscript    1   J    subscript   superscript  ζ  G    subscript  P  J        \zeta^{*}=\sum_{J\subseteq R}(-1)^{J}\zeta^{G}_{P_{J}}   Here the sum is over all subsets J of the set R of simple roots of the Coxeter system of G . The character ζ is the truncation of ζ to the parabolic subgroup P J of the subset J , given by restricting ζ to P J and then taking the space of invariants of the unipotent radical of P J , and ζ is the induced representation of G . (The operation of truncation is the adjoint functor of parabolic induction .)  Examples   The dual of the trivial character 1 is the Steinberg character .   showed that the dual of a Deligne–Lusztig character  R is ε G ε T R .  The dual of a cuspidal character χ is (–1) |Δ| χ, where Δ is the set of simple roots.  The dual of the Gelfand–Graev character is the character taking value | Z F | q l on the regular unipotent elements and vanishing elsewhere.
