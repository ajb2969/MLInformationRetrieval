Alvis–Curtis duality

In mathematics, Alvis–Curtis duality is a duality operation on the characters of a reductive group over a finite field, introduced by  and studied by his student .  introduced a similar duality operation for Lie algebras.
Alvis–Curtis duality has order 2 and is an isometry on generalized characters.
discusses Alvis–Curtis duality in detail.
Definition
The dual ζ* of a character ζ of a finite group G with a split BN-pair is defined to be


 
  Here the sum is over all subsets J of the set R of simple roots of the Coxeter system of G. The character ζ is the truncation of ζ to the parabolic subgroup PJ of the subset J, given by restricting ζ to PJ and then taking the space of invariants of the unipotent radical of PJ, and ζ is the induced representation of G. (The operation of truncation is the adjoint functor of parabolic induction.)
Examples

The dual of the trivial character 1 is the Steinberg character.

showed that the dual of a Deligne–Lusztig character R is εGεTR.
The dual of a cuspidal character χ is (–1)|Δ|χ, where Δ is the set of simple roots.
The dual of the Gelfand–Graev character is the character taking value |ZF|ql on the regular unipotent elements and vanishing elsewhere.
