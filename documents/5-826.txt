Lebesgue point

In mathematics, given a locally Lebesgue integrable function 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , a point 
 
 
 
  in the domain of 
 
 
 
 
  is a Lebesgue point if1



Here, 
 
 
 
  is a ball centered at 
 
 
 
  with radius 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 
  is its Lebesgue measure. The Lebesgue points of 
 
 
 
  are thus points where 
 
 
 
  does not oscillate too much, in an average sense.2
The Lebesgue differentiation theorem states that, given any 
 
 
 
 , almost every

 
  is a Lebesgue point.3
