Semicomputable function

In computability theory, a semicomputable function is a partial function

 
  that can be approximated either from above or from below by a computable function.
More precisely a partial function

 
  is upper semicomputable, meaning it can be approximated from above, if there exists a computable function

 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the desired parameter for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the level of approximation, such that:








Completely analogous a partial function

 
  is lower semicomputable iff 
 
 
 
  is upper semicomputable or equivalently if there exists a computable function

 
  such that








If a partial function is both upper and lower semicomputable it is called computable.
