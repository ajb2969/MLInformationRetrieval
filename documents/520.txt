   Encoder receiver transmitter      Encoder receiver transmitter   Encoder receiver transmitter (ERT) is a packet radio protocol developed by Itron for automatic meter reading . 1 The technology is used to transmit data from utility meters over a short range so a utility vehicle can collect meter data without a worker physically inspecting each meter.  The ERT protocol was first described in US Patent 4,614,945. 2 More technical detail is explained in later US patent 4,799,059. 3  Technical details  ERT is an OOK modulated radio signal which is transmitted in the unlicensed 900-920 MHz band . 4 The message is transmitted in the clear and uses Manchester encoding . The protocol uses frequency-hopping , a multiple access method to avoid interference with other nearby meters. SCM and IDM packet formats are described in US Patent 7,830,874: 5  SCM packet  SCM messages are 12 bytes. Each message contains single, cumulative meter reading value along with the meter serial number, commodity type and checksum and tamper flags.

Later patents describe further variations of packets with variable length.  Implementations  Several vendors (besides Itron) have implemented ERT receivers (usually in order to read consumption data from Itron meters.) Notably, Digi sells an ERT gateway , and Grid Insight sells a PC-based product called the AMRUSB-1 .  It should be possible to decode ERT signals using general purpose UHF packet radios such as the Texas Instruments CC1101 or [ http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=MC33696&webpageId; ;=M10PHKGTk Freescale MC33696]. A software-defined radio receiver has been implemented using inexpensive hardware: RTLAMR  References  Further reading   Grid Insight - Itron ERT technology  Dave's Tech Blog - Itron Remote Read Electric Meter  RTLAMR - An rtl-sdr receiver for the ERT protocol   "  Category:Packet radio  Category:Smart grid     ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩
