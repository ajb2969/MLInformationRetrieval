König's theorem (complex analysis)

In complex analysis and numerical analysis, König's theorem,1 named after the Hungarian mathematician Gyula Kőnig, gives a way to estimate simple poles or simple roots of a function. In particular, it has numerous applications in root finding algorithms like Newton's method and its generalization Householder's method.
Statement
Given a meromorphic function defined on 
 
 
 
  Suppose it only has one simple pole 
 
 
 
  in this disk. If 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , then


 
  In particular, we have



Intuition
Near x=r we expect the function to be dominated by the pole:


 
  Matching the coefficients we see that $\frac{c_n}{c_{n+1}}\approx r$.
