   Lévy metric      Lévy metric   In mathematics , the Lévy metric is a metric on the space of cumulative distribution functions of one-dimensional random variables . It is a special case of the Lévy–Prokhorov metric , and is named after the French mathematician Paul Lévy .  Definition  Let     F  ,  G   :   ℝ  →   [  0  ,  1  ]       normal-:   F  G    normal-→  ℝ   0  1      F,G:\mathbb{R}\to[0,1]   be two cumulative distribution functions. Define the Lévy distance between them to be        L   (  F  ,  G  )    :=   inf   {   ε  >  0   |     F   (   x  -  ε   )    -  ε   ≤   G   (  x  )    ≤    F   (   x  +  ε   )    +    ε    for    all   x    ∈  ℝ   }     .     assign    L   F  G     infimum   conditional-set    ε  0           F    x  ε    ε     G  x            F    x  ε      ε  for  all  x         ℝ        L(F,G):=\inf\{\varepsilon>0|F(x-\varepsilon)-\varepsilon\leq G(x)\leq F(x+%
 \varepsilon)+\varepsilon\mathrm{\,for\,all\,}x\in\mathbb{R}\}.     Intuitively, if between the graphs of F and G one inscribes squares with sides parallel to the coordinate axes (at points of discontinuity of a graph vertical segments are added), then the side-length of the largest such square is equal to L ( F , G ).
