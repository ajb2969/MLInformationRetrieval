Continuum (set theory)

In the mathematical field of set theory, the continuum means the real numbers, or the corresponding (infinite) cardinal number, 
 
 
 
 . Georg Cantor proved that the cardinality 
 
 
 
  is larger than the smallest infinity, namely, 
 
 
 
 . He also proved that 
 
 
 
  equals 
 
 
 
 , the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers.
The cardinality of the continuum is the size of the set of real numbers. The continuum hypothesis is sometimes stated by saying that no cardinality lies between that of the continuum and that of the natural numbers, 
 
 
 
 .
Linear continuum
According to Raymond Wilder (1965) there are four axioms that make a set C and the relation
