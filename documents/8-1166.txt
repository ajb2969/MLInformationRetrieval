   Root datum      Root datum   In mathematical group theory , the root datum of a connected split reductive  algebraic group over a field is a generalization of a root system that determines the group up to isomorphism. They were introduced by Michel Demazure in SGA III , published in 1970.  Definition  A root datum consists of a quadruple      (   X  ∗   ,  Φ  ,   X  ∗   ,   Φ  ∨   )      superscript  X  normal-∗   normal-Φ   subscript  X  normal-∗    superscript  normal-Φ      (X^{\ast},\Phi,X_{\ast},\Phi^{\vee})   , where       X  ∗     superscript  X  normal-∗    X^{\ast}   and    X  ∗     subscript  X  normal-∗    X_{\ast}   are free abelian groups of finite rank together with a perfect pairing between them with values in   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   which we denote by ( , ) (in other words, each is identified with the dual lattice of the other).     Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is a finite subset of    X  ∗     superscript  X  normal-∗    X^{\ast}   and    Φ  ∨     superscript  normal-Φ     \Phi^{\vee}   is a finite subset of    X  ∗     subscript  X  normal-∗    X_{\ast}   and there is a bijection from   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   onto    Φ  ∨     superscript  normal-Φ     \Phi^{\vee}   , denoted by    α  ↦   α  ∨      maps-to  α   superscript  α      \alpha\mapsto\alpha^{\vee}   .  For each   α   α   \alpha   ,     (  α  ,   α  ∨   )   =  2       α   superscript  α     2    (\alpha,\alpha^{\vee})=2   .  For each   α   α   \alpha   , the map    x  ↦   x  -    (  x  ,   α  ∨   )   α       maps-to  x    x     x   superscript  α     α      x\mapsto x-(x,\alpha^{\vee})\alpha   induces an automorphism of the root datum (in other words it maps   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   to   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   and the induced action on    X  ∗     subscript  X  normal-∗    X_{\ast}   maps    Φ  ∨     superscript  normal-Φ     \Phi^{\vee}   to    Φ  ∨     superscript  normal-Φ     \Phi^{\vee}   )   The elements of   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   are called the roots of the root datum, and the elements of    Φ  ∨     superscript  normal-Φ     \Phi^{\vee}   are called the coroots . The elements of    X  ∗     superscript  X  normal-∗    X^{\ast}   are sometimes called weights and those of    X  ∗     subscript  X  normal-∗    X_{\ast}   accordingly coweights .  If   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   does not contain    2  α      2  α    2\alpha   for any    α  ∈  Φ      α  normal-Φ    \alpha\in\Phi   , then the root datum is called reduced .  The root datum of an algebraic group  If G is a reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field  K with a split maximal torus T then its root datum is a quadruple   ( X * , Φ, X * , Φ v ),   where   X * is the lattice of characters of the maximal torus,  X * is the dual lattice (given by the 1-parameter subgroups),  Φ is a set of roots,  Φ v is the corresponding set of coroots.   A connected split reductive algebraic group over K is uniquely determined (up to isomorphism) by its root datum, which is always reduced. Conversely for any root datum there is a reductive algebraic group. A root datum contains slightly more information than the Dynkin diagram , because it also determines the center of the group.  For any root datum ( X * , Φ, X * , Φ v ), we can define a dual root datum ( X * , Φ v , X * , Φ) by switching the characters with the 1-parameter subgroups, and switching the roots with the coroots.  If G is a connected reductive algebraic group over the algebraically closed field K , then its Langlands dual group  L G is the complex connected reductive group whose root datum is dual to that of G .
