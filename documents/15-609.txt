   Recognizable set      Recognizable set   In computer science , more precisely in automata theory, a recognizable set of a monoid is a subset that can be distinguished by some morphism to a finite monoid. Recognizable sets are useful in automata theory , formal languages and algebra .  This notion is different from the notion of recognizable language . Indeed, the term "recognizable" has a different meaning in computability theory .  Definition  Let   N   N   N   be a monoid , a subset    S  ⊆  N      S  N    S\subseteq N   is recognized by a monoid   M   M   M   if there exists a morphism   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   from   N   N   N   to   M   M   M   such that    S  =    ϕ   -  1     (   ϕ   (  S  )    )        S     superscript  ϕ    1      ϕ  S      S=\phi^{-1}(\phi(S))   , and recognizable if it is recognized by some finite monoid. This means that there exists a subset   T   T   T   of   M   M   M   (not necessarily a submonoid of   M   M   M   ) such that the image of   S   S   S   is in   T   T   T   and the image of    N  ∖  S      N  S    N\setminus S   is in    M  ∖  T      M  T    M\setminus T   .  Example  Let   A   A   A   be an alphabet : the set    A  *     superscript  A     A^{*}   of words over   A   A   A   is a monoid, the free monoid on   A   A   A   . The recognizable subsets of    A  *     superscript  A     A^{*}   are precisely the regular languages . Indeed such a language is recognized by the transition monoid of any automaton that recognizes the language.  The recognizable subsets of   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   are the ultimately periodic sets of integers.  Properties  A subset of   N   N   N   is recognizable if and only if its syntactic monoid is finite.  The set    REC   (  N  )       REC  N    \mathrm{REC}(N)   of recognizable subsets of   N   N   N   contains every finite subset of   N   N   N   and is closed under:   union  intersection  complement  right and left quotient   McKnight's theorem states that if   N   N   N   is finitely generated then its recognizable subsets are rational subsets . This is not true in general, i.e.    REC   (  N  )       REC  N    \mathrm{REC}(N)   is not closed under Kleene star . Let    N  =   ℕ  2       N   superscript  ℕ  2     N=\mathbb{N}^{2}   , the set    S  =   {   (  1  ,  1  )   }       S    1  1      S=\{(1,1)\}   is finite, hence recognizable, but     S  *   =   {   (  i  ,  i  )   ∣   i  ∈  ℕ   }        superscript  S     conditional-set   i  i     i  ℕ      S^{*}=\{(i,i)\mid i\in\mathbb{N}\}   is not recognizable. Indeed its syntactic monoid is infinite.  The intersection of a rational subset and of a recognizable subset is rational.  Recognizable sets are closed under inverse morphism. I.e. if   N   N   N   and   M   M   M   are monoids and    ϕ  :   N  →  M      normal-:  ϕ   normal-→  N  M     \phi:N\rightarrow M   is a morphism then if    S  ∈   REC   (  M  )        S    REC  M     S\in\mathrm{REC}(M)   then      ϕ   -  1     (  S  )    =   {  x  ∣    ϕ   (  x  )    ∈  S   }   ∈   REC   (  M  )             superscript  ϕ    1    S    conditional-set  x      ϕ  x   S           REC  M      \phi^{-1}(S)=\{x\mid\phi(x)\in S\}\in\mathrm{REC}(M)   .  For finite groups the following result of Anissimov and Seifert is well known: a subgroup  H of a finitely generated group  G is recognizable if and only if H has finite index in G . In contrast, H is rational if and only if H is finitely generated. 1  See also   Rational set  Rational monoid   References    Jean-Eric Pin, Mathematical Foundations of Automata Theory , Chapter IV: Recognisable and rational sets   Further reading     "  Category:Automata theory      preprint ↩
