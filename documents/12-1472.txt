   Minuscule 700      Minuscule 700   Minuscule 700 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), ε 133 ( Soden ), 1 is a Greek minuscule  manuscript of the Gospels . Formerly it was labelled as 604 in all catalogues (Scrivener, Hoskier), Gregory gave the number 700 to it. 2 It is dated palaeographically to the 11th century. 3  Description  The codex contains a complete text of the Gospels on 297 parchment leaves (14.8 cm by 11.7 cm). The text is written in one column per page, 19 lines per page in minuscule letters. 4 The initial letters are in gold. Simple headpieces and tailpieces are in gold.  The text of the Gospels is divided according to the  ( chapters ), whose numbers are placed at the margin of the text. The  ( titles ) of the κεφαλαια are given at the top of pages. Lists of the  ( tables of contents ) are placed before each Gospel (Matthew, Mark, Luke). There is also a division into smaller sections, the Ammonian sections with references to the Eusebian Canons .This is done in Gospel of John very rarely.  It contains the Epistula ad Carpianum , Eusebian Canon tables at the beginning of the codex, subscriptions at the end of each Gospel, illustrations of the evangelists, lectionary markings at the margin in gold. 5 It lacks Mark 11:26. 6  Text  In Matthew 27:16 it has the famous textual variant "Ιησουν τον Βαραββαν". This variant is found in Codex Koridethi , and manuscripts of textual family f 1 .  The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Caesarean text-type . Aland placed it in Category III . 7  According to the Claremont Profile Method it has mixed text in Luke 1, Alexandrian text in Luke 10, and represent the textual family K x in Luke 20. It belongs to the textual subgroup 35 . 8  It contains, together with minuscule 162 , the remarkable reading in Gospel of Luke 11:2:  ("May your Holy Spirit come upon us and cleanse us"), instead of ελθετω η βασιλεια σου ("May your kingdom come") in the Lord's Prayer . 9 This peculiar reading does not appear in any other manuscript, but it was derived from very old archetype, because it is present in the Marcion 's text of the third Gospel and is also attested by the church father Gregory of Nyssa . 10 In Luke 11:4 the phrase  ( but deliver us from evil ) is omitted. This omission is supported by the manuscripts: Sinaiticus, B, L , f 1 vg syr s cop sa, bo , arm geo. 11  In Mark 5:9 it has απεκριθη λεγων as in codices E, 565. The other manuscripts have:   λεγιων ονομα μοι — א, B, C, L, Δ  απεκριτη — D  λεγεων — A, W, Θ, f 1 , f 13 , Byz 12    In Mark 10:19 — the phrase μη αποστερησης is omitted (as in codices B , K , W , Ψ , f 1 , f 13 , 28 , 1010 , 1079, 1242 , 1546, 2148, ℓ  10 , ℓ  950 , ℓ  1642 , ℓ  1761 , syr s , arm, geo. 13 This omission is typical for the manuscript of the Caesarean text-type.  In Luke 6:2 — οὐκ ἔξεστιν ( not lawful ) for οὐκ ἔξεστιν ποιεῖν ( not lawful to do ); the reading is supported only by    𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    4 , Vaticanus, ( Codex Bezae ), Codex Nitriensis , lat, cop sa , cop bo , arm, geo; 14  In John 8:7 it has αναβλεψας instead of ανακυψας, along with U  Λ  f 13 15  In John 8:8 it contains, together with U (030) , 73 , 331 , 364 , 658 , 782 , 1592 and some Armenian manuscripts, the unique addition ενος εκαστου αυτων τας αμαρτιας. This textual variant have also some Latin manuscripts. 652 has this variant on the margin added by a later hand. Minuscule 264 has this variant in John 8:6. 16  Hoskier exhibits 2724 variations from the Textus Receptus (of which 791 are omissions and 353 are additions). 270 textual variants are not used by any other manuscript. 17  History  The author of the codex is unknown. Probably it was written in Constantinople. 18  The manuscript was bought in 1882 for the British Library . 19  It was examined by Burgon , described and collated by Simcox, and Scrivener .
