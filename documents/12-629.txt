Krawtchouk matrices

In mathematics, Krawtchouk matrices are matrices whose entries are values of Krawtchouk polynomials at nonnegative integer points.1 2 The Krawtchouk matrix K(N) is an (N+1)×(N+1) matrix. Here are the first few examples:






In general, for positive integer 
 
 
 
 , the entries 
 
 
 
  are given via the generating function


 
  where the row and column indices 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  run from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .
These Krawtchouk polynomials are orthogonal with respect to symmetric binomial distributions,
