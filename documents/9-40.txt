List of operators

In mathematics, an operator or transform is a function from one space of functions to another. Operators occur commonly in engineering, physics and mathematics. Many are integral operators and differential operators.
In the following L is an operator



which takes a function 
 
 
 
  to another function 
 
 
 
 . Here, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are some unspecified function spaces, such as Hardy space, Lp space, Sobolev space, or, more vaguely, the space of holomorphic functions.
