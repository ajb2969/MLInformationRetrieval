Ovoid (polar space)

In mathematics, an ovoid O of a (finite) polar space of rank r is a set of points, such that every subspace of rank 
 
 
 
  intersects O in exactly one point.1
Cases
Symplectic polar space
An ovoid of 
 
 
 
  (a symplectic polar space of rank n) would contain 
 
 
 
  points. However it only has an ovoid if and only 
 
 
 
  and q is even. In that case, when the polar space is embedded into 
 
 
 
  the classical way, it is also an ovoid in the projective geometry sense.
Hermitian polar space
Ovoids of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  would contain 
 
 
 
  points.
Hyperbolic quadrics
An ovoid of a hyperbolic quadric
 
 
 
 would contain 
 
 
 
  points.
Parabolic quadrics
An ovoid of a parabolic quadric 
 
 
 
  would contain 
 
 
 
  points. For 
 
 
 
 , it is easy to see to obtain an ovoid by cutting the parabolic quadric with a hyperplane, such that the intersection is an elliptic quadric. The intersection is an ovoid. If q is even, 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic (as polar space) with 
 
 
 
 , and thus due to the above, it has no ovoid for 
 
 
 
 .
Elliptic quadrics
An ovoid of an elliptic quadric 
 
 
 
 would contain 
 
 
 
  points.
