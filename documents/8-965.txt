   Ovoid (polar space)      Ovoid (polar space)   In mathematics , an ovoid  O of a (finite) polar space of rank r is a set of points, such that every subspace of rank    r  -  1      r  1    r-1   intersects O in exactly one point. 1  Cases  Symplectic polar space  An ovoid of     W    2  n   -  1     (  q  )        subscript  W      2  n   1    q    W_{2n-1}(q)   (a symplectic polar space of rank n ) would contain     q  n   +  1       superscript  q  n   1    q^{n}+1   points. However it only has an ovoid if and only    n  =  2      n  2    n=2   and q is even. In that case, when the polar space is embedded into    P  G   (  3  ,  q  )       P  G   3  q     PG(3,q)   the classical way, it is also an ovoid in the projective geometry sense.  Hermitian polar space  Ovoids of    H   (  2  n  ,   q  2   )    (  n  ≥  2  )      fragments  H   fragments  normal-(  2  n  normal-,   superscript  q  2   normal-)    fragments  normal-(  n   2  normal-)     H(2n,q^{2})(n\geq 2)   and    H   (  2  n  +  1  ,   q  2   )    (  n  ≥  1  )      fragments  H   fragments  normal-(  2  n   1  normal-,   superscript  q  2   normal-)    fragments  normal-(  n   1  normal-)     H(2n+1,q^{2})(n\geq 1)   would contain     q    2  n   +  1    +  1       superscript  q      2  n   1    1    q^{2n+1}+1   points.  Hyperbolic quadrics  An ovoid of a hyperbolic quadric     Q  +    (  2  n  -  1  ,  q  )    (  n  ≥  2  )      fragments   superscript  Q     fragments  normal-(  2  n   1  normal-,  q  normal-)    fragments  normal-(  n   2  normal-)     Q^{+}(2n-1,q)(n\geq 2)   would contain     q   n  -  1    +  1       superscript  q    n  1    1    q^{n-1}+1   points.  Parabolic quadrics  An ovoid of a parabolic quadric    Q   (  2  n  ,  q  )    (  n  ≥  2  )      fragments  Q   fragments  normal-(  2  n  normal-,  q  normal-)    fragments  normal-(  n   2  normal-)     Q(2n,q)(n\geq 2)   would contain     q  n   +  1       superscript  q  n   1    q^{n}+1   points. For    n  =  2      n  2    n=2   , it is easy to see to obtain an ovoid by cutting the parabolic quadric with a hyperplane, such that the intersection is an elliptic quadric. The intersection is an ovoid. If q is even,    Q   (   2  n   ,  q  )       Q     2  n   q     Q(2n,q)   is isomorphic (as polar space) with     W    2  n   -  1     (  q  )        subscript  W      2  n   1    q    W_{2n-1}(q)   , and thus due to the above, it has no ovoid for    n  ≥  3      n  3    n\geq 3   .  Elliptic quadrics  An ovoid of an elliptic quadric     Q  -    (  2  n  +  1  ,  q  )    (  n  ≥  2  )      fragments   superscript  Q     fragments  normal-(  2  n   1  normal-,  q  normal-)    fragments  normal-(  n   2  normal-)     Q^{-}(2n+1,q)(n\geq 2)   would contain     q  n   +  1       superscript  q  n   1    q^{n}+1   points.
