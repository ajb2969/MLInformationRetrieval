   Sucrose-phosphate synthase      Sucrose-phosphate synthase   In enzymology , a sucrose-phosphate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + D-fructose 6-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + sucrose 6-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and D-fructose 6-phosphate , whereas its two products are UDP and sucrose 6-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:D-fructose-6-phosphate 2-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include UDP-glucose-fructose-phosphate glucosyltransferase , sucrosephosphate-UDP glucosyltransferase , UDP-glucose-fructose-phosphate glucosyltransferase , SPS , uridine diphosphoglucose-fructose phosphate glucosyltransferase , sucrose 6-phosphate synthase , sucrose phosphate synthetase , and sucrose phosphate-uridine diphosphate glucosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
