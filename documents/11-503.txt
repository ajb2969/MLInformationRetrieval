Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA hydrolase




Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA hydrolase

In enzymology, a hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA + H2O 
 
 
 
  CoA + 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA and H2O, whereas its two products are CoA and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA hydrolase. Other names in common use include beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A hydrolase, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A deacylase, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A hydrolase, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A deacylase, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA hydrolase.
