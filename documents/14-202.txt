   Pseudomanifold      Pseudomanifold   A pseudomanifold is a special type of topological space . It looks like a manifold at most of the points, but may contain singularities. For example, the cone of solutions of     z  2   =    x  2   +   y  2         superscript  z  2      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2      z^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}   forms a pseudomanifold.  [[ File:Pinched torus.jpg|thumb|   A pinched torus   ]] A pseudomanifold can be regarded as a combinatorial realisation of the general idea of a manifold with singularities . The concepts of orientability , orientation and degree of a mapping make sense for pseudomanifolds and moreover, within the combinatorial approach, pseudomanifolds form the natural domain of definition for these concepts. 1 2  Definition  A topological space X endowed with a triangulation  K is an n -dimensional pseudomanifold if the following conditions hold: 3   ( pure )  is the union of all n - simplices .  Every  is a face of exactly two n -simplices for n > 1 .  For every pair of n -simplices σ and σ' in K , there is a sequence of n -simplices such that the intersection  is an  for all i .   Implications of the definition   Condition 2 means that X is a non-branching  simplicial complex . 4  Condition 3 means that X is a strongly connected simplicial complex. 5   Related definitions   A pseudomanifold is called normal if link of each simplex with codimension     ≥  2      absent  2    \geq 2   is a pseudomanifold.   Examples   A pinched torus (see figure) is an example of an orientable , compact 2-dimensional pseudomanifold. 6    Complex algebraic varieties (even with singularities) are examples of pseudomanifolds. 7    Thom spaces of vector bundles over triangulable compact manifolds are examples of pseudomanifolds. 8    Triangulable, compact , connected , homology manifolds over Z are examples of pseudomanifolds. 9   References  "  Category:Topological spaces  Category:Manifolds     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
