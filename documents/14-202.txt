Pseudomanifold

A pseudomanifold is a special type of topological space. It looks like a manifold at most of the points, but may contain singularities. For example, the cone of solutions of 
 
 
 
  forms a pseudomanifold.

A pinched torus

]] A pseudomanifold can be regarded as a combinatorial realisation of the general idea of a manifold with singularities. The concepts of orientability, orientation and degree of a mapping make sense for pseudomanifolds and moreover, within the combinatorial approach, pseudomanifolds form the natural domain of definition for these concepts.12
Definition
A topological space X endowed with a triangulation K is an n-dimensional pseudomanifold if the following conditions hold:3

(pure)  is the union of all n-simplices.
Every  is a face of exactly two n-simplices for n > 1.
For every pair of n-simplices σ and σ' in K, there is a sequence of n-simplices  such that the intersection  is an  for all i.

Implications of the definition

Condition 2 means that X is a non-branching simplicial complex.4
Condition 3 means that X is a strongly connected simplicial complex.5
