Clausen's formula

In mathematics, Clausen's formula, found by , expresses the square of a Gaussian hypergeometric series as a generalized hypergeometric series. It states


 
  In particular it gives conditions for a hypergeometric series to be positive. This can be used to prove several inequalities, such as the Askeyâ€“Gasper inequality used in the proof of de Branges's theorem.
