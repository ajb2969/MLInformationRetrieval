   Clausen's formula      Clausen's formula   In mathematics, Clausen's formula , found by , expresses the square of a Gaussian hypergeometric series as a generalized hypergeometric series . It states         F  1    2       [     a    b       a  +  b  +   1  /  2       ;  x  ]   2     =  3     F  2    [      2  a      2  b      a  ;   +  b         a  +  b  +   1  /  2        2  a   +   2  b       ;  x  ]        subscript   3      subscript   subscript  F  1   2    superscript     a  b      a  b    1  2      x   2       subscript  F  2        2  a     2  b    a    b        a  b    1  2        2  a     2  b      x      \;{}_{2}F_{1}\left[\begin{matrix}a&b\\
 a+b+1/2\end{matrix};x\right]^{2}=\;_{3}F_{2}\left[\begin{matrix}2a&2b&a+b\\
 a+b+1/2&2a+2b\end{matrix};x\right]   In particular it gives conditions for a hypergeometric series to be positive. This can be used to prove several inequalities, such as the Askeyâ€“Gasper inequality used in the proof of de Branges's theorem .  References      "  Category:Special functions
