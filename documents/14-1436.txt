   ΔP      ΔP   Δ P ( Delta P ) is a mathematical term used to illustrate a change (Δ) in pressure ( P ).  Uses   Young–Laplace equation   Darcy–Weisbach equation  As used in the Darcy–Weisbach equation — Given that the head loss  h f expresses the pressure loss Δp as the height of a column of fluid,       Δ  p   =   ρ  ⋅  g  ⋅   h  f          normal-Δ  p    normal-⋅  ρ  g   subscript  h  f      \Delta p=\rho\cdot g\cdot h_{f}     where ρ is the density of the fluid, the Darcy–Weisbach equation can also be written in terms of pressure loss:       Δ  p   =   f  ⋅   L  D   ⋅    ρ   V  2    2          normal-Δ  p    normal-⋅  f    L  D       ρ   superscript  V  2    2      \Delta p=f\cdot\frac{L}{D}\cdot\frac{\rho V^{2}}{2}     Lung compliance  In general, compliance is defined by the change in volume ( ΔV ) versus the associated change in pressure (ΔP), or ΔV/ΔP . During mechanical ventilation , compliance can be influenced by 3 key physiologic factors:   Lung compliance  Chest wall compliance  Airway resistance   Lung compliance is influenced by a variety of primary abnormalities of lung parenchyma , both chronic and acute. Airway resistance is typically increased by bronchospasm and airway secretions. Chest wall compliance can be decreased by fixed abnormalities (e.g. kyphoscoliosis , morbid obesity ) or more variable problems driven by patient agitation while intubated. 1  Calculating Compliance on minute volume (V E : ΔV is always defined by tidal volume (V T ), but ΔP is different for the measurement of dynamic vs. static compliance.  Dynamic Compliance (C dyn )       C   d  y  n    =    V  T     P  I  P   -   P  E  E  P          subscript  C    d  y  n       subscript  V  T       P  I  P     P  E  E  P       C_{dyn}=\frac{{V_{T}}}{{PIP-PEEP}}     where PIP = peak inspiratory pressure (the maximum pressure during inspiration), and PEEP = positive end expiratory pressure . Alterations in airway resistance, lung compliance and chest wall compliance influence C dyn .  Static Compliance (C stat )       C   s  t  a  t    =    V  T     P   p  l  a  t    -   P  E  E  P          subscript  C    s  t  a  t       subscript  V  T      subscript  P    p  l  a  t      P  E  E  P       C_{stat}=\frac{{V_{T}}}{{P_{plat}-PEEP}}   where P plat = plateau pressure. P plat is measured at the end of inhalation and prior to exhalation using an inspiratory hold maneuver. During this maneuver, airflow is transiently (~0.5 sec) discontinued, which eliminates the effects of airway resistance. P plat is never > PIP and is typically 2O lower than PIP when airway resistance is normal.
