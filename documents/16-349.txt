   Darcy number      Darcy number   In fluid dynamics through porous media , the Darcy number ( Da ) represents the relative effect of the permeability of the medium versus its cross-sectional area—commonly the diameter squared. The number is named after Henry Darcy and is found from nondimensionalizing the differential form of Darcy's Law . This number should not be confused with the Darcy friction factor which applies to pressure drop in a pipe. It is defined as      Da  =   K   d  2        Da    K   superscript  d  2      \mathrm{Da}=\frac{K}{d^{2}}     where   K is the permeability of the medium;  d is the diameter of the particle. 1   Alternate forms of this number do exist depending on the approach that Darcy's Law is made dimensionless and the geometry of the system. 2 The Darcy number is commonly used in heat transfer through porous media. 3  See also   Capillary pressure  Dimensionless quantityeeeeeDD 23FSEWEDDFFeffcgutirui39yrwsf zy2tdwyuqktlw,k2jw6,kwljfjto4gjtgleekel   References  "  Category:Dimensionless numbers of fluid mechanics  Category:Engineering     ↩  http://www.thermopedia.com/content/684/ ↩  http://sharif.ir/~anouri/JP/13.pdf ↩
