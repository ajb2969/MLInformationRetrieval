   Rauzy fractal      Rauzy fractal   In mathematics, the Rauzy fractal is a fractal set associated to the Tribonacci substitution        s   (  1  )    =  12   ,     s   (  2  )    =  13   ,    s   (  3  )    =  1 .       formulae-sequence      s  1   12    formulae-sequence      s  2   13       s  3   1 .      s(1)=12,\ s(2)=13,\ s(3)=1\,.     It has been studied in 1981 by Gérard Rauzy, 1 with the idea of generalizing the dynamic properties of the Fibonacci morphism . That fractal set can be generalized to other maps on a 3 letter alphabet, generating other fractal sets with interesting properties, such as periodic tiling of the plane and self-similarity in three homothetic parts.  Definitions  Tribonacci word  The infinite tribonacci word is a word constructed by applying iteratively the Tribonacci or Rauzy map      s   (  1  )    =  12        s  1   12    s(1)=12   ,     s   (  2  )    =  13        s  2   13    s(2)=13   ,     s   (  3  )    =  1        s  3   1    s(3)=1   . 2 3 Starting from 1, the Tribonacci words are: 4        t  0   =  1       subscript  t  0   1    t_{0}=1          t  1   =  12       subscript  t  1   12    t_{1}=12          t  2   =  1213       subscript  t  2   1213    t_{2}=1213          t  3   =  1213121       subscript  t  3   1213121    t_{3}=1213121          t  4   =  1213121121312       subscript  t  4   1213121121312    t_{4}=1213121121312      We can show that, for    n  >  2      n  2    n>2   ,     t  n   =    t   n  -  1     t   n  -  2     t   n  -  3          subscript  t  n      subscript  t    n  1     subscript  t    n  2     subscript  t    n  3       t_{n}=t_{n-1}t_{n-2}t_{n-3}   , hence the name " Tribonacci ".  Fractal construction  (Figure)  Construction   Let's consider, now, the space    R  3     superscript  R  3    R^{3}   with cartesian coordinates (x,y,z). The Rauzy fractal is constructed this way: 5  1) Interpret the sequence of letters of the infinite Tribonacci word as a sequence of unitary vectors of the space, with the following rules (1 = direction x, 2 = direction y, 3 = direction z).  2) Then, build a "stair" by tracing the points reached by this sequence of vectors (see figure). For example, the first points are:       1  ⇒   (  1  ,  0  ,  0  )      normal-⇒  1   1  0  0     1\Rightarrow(1,0,0)         2  ⇒   (  1  ,  1  ,  0  )      normal-⇒  2   1  1  0     2\Rightarrow(1,1,0)         1  ⇒   (  2  ,  1  ,  0  )      normal-⇒  1   2  1  0     1\Rightarrow(2,1,0)         3  ⇒   (  2  ,  1  ,  1  )      normal-⇒  3   2  1  1     3\Rightarrow(2,1,1)         1  ⇒   (  3  ,  1  ,  1  )      normal-⇒  1   3  1  1     1\Rightarrow(3,1,1)      etc...Every point can be coloured according to the corresponding letter, to stress the self-similarity property.  3) Then, project those points on the contracting plane (plane orthogonal to the main direction of propagation of the points, none of those projected points escape to infinity).  Properties   Can be tiled by three copies of itself, reduced by factors   k   k   k   ,    k  2     superscript  k  2    k^{2}   and    k  3     superscript  k  3    k^{3}   with   k   k   k   solution of       k  3   +   k  2   +  k   -  1   =  0           superscript  k  3    superscript  k  2   k   1   0    k^{3}+k^{2}+k-1=0       k  =     1  3     (     -  1   -    2    17  +   3   33     3      +    17  +   3   33     3    )    =  0.54368901269207636        k      1  3         1     2     3     17    3    33           3     17    3    33             0.54368901269207636     \scriptstyle{k=\frac{1}{3}(-1-\frac{2}{\sqrt[3]{17+3\sqrt{33}}}+\sqrt[3]{17+3%
 \sqrt{33}})=0.54368901269207636}   .  Stable by exchanging pieces. We can obtain the same set by exchanging the place of the pieces.  Connected and simply connected. Has no hole.  Tiles the plane periodically, by translation.  The matrix of the Tribonacci map has for characteristic polynomial      x  3   -   x  2   -  x  -  1       superscript  x  3    superscript  x  2   x  1    x^{3}-x^{2}-x-1   , its eigenvalues are a real number    β  =  1.8392      β  1.8392    \beta=1.8392   , called Tribonacci constant , a Pisot number , and two complex conjugated numbers   α   α   \alpha   and    α  ¯     normal-¯  α    \bar{\alpha}   with     α   α  ¯    =   1  /  β         α   normal-¯  α      1  β     \alpha\bar{\alpha}=1/\beta   .  Its boundary is fractal, and the Hausdorff dimension of this boundary equals 1.0933, the solution of      2    |  α  |    3  s     +    |  α  |    4  s     =  1          2   superscript    α     3  s      superscript    α     4  s     1    2|\alpha|^{3s}+|\alpha|^{4s}=1   . 6   Variants and generalization  For any unimodular substitution of Pisot type, which verifies a coïncidence condition (apparently always verified), one can construct a similar set called "Rauzy fractal of the map". They all display self-similarity and generate, for the examples below, a periodic tiling of the plane.
