   Suslin operation      Suslin operation   In mathematics, the Suslin operation A is an operation that constructs a set from a collection of sets indexed by finite sequences of positive integers. The Suslin operation was introduced by  and . In Russia it is sometimes called the A-operation after Alexandrov. It is sometimes denoted by the symbol   ùíú   ùíú   \mathcal{A}   (a calligraphic capital letter A).  Definitions  Suppose we have Suslin scheme , in other words a function M from finite sequences of positive integers n 1 ,..., n k to sets M n 1 ,..., n k . The result of the Suslin operation is the set   A ( M ) = ‚à™ ( M n 1 ‚à© M n 1 , n 2 ‚à© M n 1 , n 2 , n 3 ‚à© ...)   where the union is taken over all infinite sequences n 1 ,..., n k ,...  If M is a family of subsets of a set X , then A ( M ) is the family of subsets of X obtained by applying the Suslin operation A to all collections as above where all the sets M n 1 ,..., n k are in M . The Suslin operation on collections of subsets of X has the property that A ( A ( M )) = A ( M ). The family A ( M ) is closed under taking countable unions or intersections, but is not in general closed under taking complements.  If M is the family of closed subsets of a topological space, then the elements of A ( M ) are called Suslin sets , or analytic sets if the space is a Polish space .
