Suslin operation

In mathematics, the Suslin operation A is an operation that constructs a set from a collection of sets indexed by finite sequences of positive integers. The Suslin operation was introduced by  and . In Russia it is sometimes called the A-operation after Alexandrov. It is sometimes denoted by the symbol 
 
 
 
  (a calligraphic capital letter A).
Definitions
Suppose we have Suslin scheme, in other words a function M from finite sequences of positive integers n1,...,nk to sets Mn1,...,nk. The result of the Suslin operation is the set

A(M) = ∪ (Mn1 ∩ Mn1,n2 ∩ Mn1,n2, n3 ∩ ...)
 

where the union is taken over all infinite sequences n1,...,nk,...
If M is a family of subsets of a set X, then A(M) is the family of subsets of X obtained by applying the Suslin operation A to all collections as above where all the sets Mn1,...,nk are in M. The Suslin operation on collections of subsets of X has the property that A(A(M)) = A(M). The family A(M) is closed under taking countable unions or intersections, but is not in general closed under taking complements.
If M is the family of closed subsets of a topological space, then the elements of A(M) are called Suslin sets, or analytic sets if the space is a Polish space.
