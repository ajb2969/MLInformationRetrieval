   Papyrus 75      Papyrus 75   Papyrus 75 (   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    75 , Papyrus Bodmer XIV-XV ) is an early Greek New Testament papyrus .  Description  Originally '[it] contained about 144 pages ... of which 102 have survived, either in whole or in part.' 1 It 'contains about half the text of ... two Gospels' 2 – Luke ( Papyrus Bodmer XIV) and John ( Papyrus Bodmer XV) in Greek . It is dated in Nestle-Aland (27th edition, NA27 ) as being an early third century manuscript . It is one of the earliest manuscripts (along with    𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    4 ) 3 of the Gospel of Luke . 'The surviving fragment contains Luke 3:18-24:53 ...' 4 5 An unusual feature of this codex is that when the Gospel of Luke ends, the Gospel of John begins on the same page. 6  It lacks text of Christ's agony at Gethsemane (Luke 22:43–44) 7 and Pericope Adulterae .  It uses a staurogram in Luke 14:27.  Text  The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type . Kurt Aland placed it in Category I . 8 The text is closer to Codex Vaticanus than to Codex Sinaiticus . Agreement between   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    75 and codex B is 92% in John, 9 and 94% in Luke. 10 It concurs with    𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    111 . 11  According to Kurt Aland,   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    75 is the key for understanding the primitive textual history of New Testament. 12  In Luke 8:21 it reads αυτον instead of αυτους; the reading is supported by Minuscule 705 and Codex Veronensis . 13  Textual variants  In Luke 11:4, the phrase  ( but deliver us from evil ) is omitted. The omission of this phrase is also supported by the following manuscripts: Sinaiticus , Vaticanus , Codex Regius , f 1 , 700 , vg , syr s , cop sa, bo , arm, geo. 14  In Luke 16:19 the manuscript reads Ανθρωπος δε τις ην πλουσιος, ονοματι Ν[ιν]ευης, και ενεδιδυσκετο "There was a rich man, with the name N[in]eue, who clothed himself", 15 This reading has support from the Sahidic version and the two Greek minuscule manuscripts 36 and 37 , in addition to a scholion of uncertain date have ευρον δε τινες και του πλουσιου εν τισιν αντιγραφοις τουνομα Νινευης λεγομενον. 16  Luke 22:43-44 is omitted, as in codices א*, A , B, T , 1071. 17  In Luke 23:34,   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    75 has omitted the words: "And Jesus said: Father forgive them, they know not what they do." This omission is supported by the manuscripts Sinaiticus a , B, D* , W , Θ , 0124 , 1241, it a , d , syr s , cop sa , cop bo . 18  Luke 24:26   δοξαν – majority of mss  βασιλειαν –   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    75 19    John 10:7   η θυρα ( door ) – majority  ο ποιμην ( shepherd ) –   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    75 cop sa cop ac 20    The manuscript also lacks the Pericope of the Adulteress , usually placed in Translations at John 7:53-8:11. This omission is supported by the manuscripts Codex Sinaiticus , Codex Vaticanus and    𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    66 .  The manuscript is currently housed at the Vatican Library (P. Bodmer XIV-XV) at Rome . 21  The discovery of   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    75 has had a profound effect on New Testament textual criticism , due to its great agreement with Codex Vaticanus.
