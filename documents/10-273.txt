Papyrus 75

Papyrus 75 (
 
 
75, Papyrus Bodmer XIV-XV) is an early Greek New Testament papyrus.
Description
Originally '[it] contained about 144 pages ... of which 102 have survived, either in whole or in part.'1 It 'contains about half the text of ... two Gospels'2 – Luke (Papyrus Bodmer XIV) and John (Papyrus Bodmer XV) in Greek. It is dated in Nestle-Aland (27th edition, NA27) as being an early third century manuscript. It is one of the earliest manuscripts (along with 

4)3 of the Gospel of Luke. 'The surviving fragment contains Luke 3:18-24:53 ...'45 An unusual feature of this codex is that when the Gospel of Luke ends, the Gospel of John begins on the same page.6
It lacks text of Christ's agony at Gethsemane (Luke 22:43–44)7 and Pericope Adulterae.
It uses a staurogram in Luke 14:27.
Text
The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type. Kurt Aland placed it in Category I.8 The text is closer to Codex Vaticanus than to Codex Sinaiticus. Agreement between 
 
 
75 and codex B is 92% in John,9 and 94% in Luke.10 It concurs with 

111.11
According to Kurt Aland, 
 
 
75 is the key for understanding the primitive textual history of New Testament.12
In Luke 8:21 it reads αυτον instead of αυτους; the reading is supported by Minuscule 705 and Codex Veronensis.13
Textual variants
In Luke 11:4, the phrase  (but deliver us from evil) is omitted. The omission of this phrase is also supported by the following manuscripts: Sinaiticus, Vaticanus, Codex Regius, f1, 700, vg, syrs, copsa, bo, arm, geo.14
In Luke 16:19 the manuscript reads Ανθρωπος δε τις ην πλουσιος, ονοματι Ν[ιν]ευης, και ενεδιδυσκετο "There was a rich man, with the name N[in]eue, who clothed himself",15 This reading has support from the Sahidic version and the two Greek minuscule manuscripts 36 and 37, in addition to a scholion of uncertain date have ευρον δε τινες και του πλουσιου εν τισιν αντιγραφοις τουνομα Νινευης λεγομενον.16
Luke 22:43-44 is omitted, as in codices א*, A, B, T, 1071.17
In Luke 23:34, 
 
 
75 has omitted the words: "And Jesus said: Father forgive them, they know not what they do." This omission is supported by the manuscripts Sinaiticusa, B, D*, W, Θ, 0124, 1241, ita, d, syrs, copsa, copbo.18
Luke 24:26

δοξαν – majority of mss
 
βασιλειαν – 
 
 
7519


John 10:7

η θυρα (door) – majority
 
ο ποιμην (shepherd) – 
 
 
75 copsa copac20


The manuscript also lacks the Pericope of the Adulteress, usually placed in Translations at John 7:53-8:11. This omission is supported by the manuscripts Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus and 

66.
The manuscript is currently housed at the Vatican Library (P. Bodmer XIV-XV) at Rome.21
The discovery of 
 
 
75 has had a profound effect on New Testament textual criticism, due to its great agreement with Codex Vaticanus.
