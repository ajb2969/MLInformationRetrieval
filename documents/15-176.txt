Bandwidth-sharing game

A bandwidth-sharing game is a type of resource allocation game designed to model the real-world allocation of bandwidth to many users in a network. The game is popular in game theory because the conclusions can be applied to real-life networks. The game is described as follows:
The game



 
  players
each player 
 
 
 
  has utility 
 
 
 
  for amount 
 
 
 
  of bandwidth
user 
 
 
 
  pays 
 
 
 
  for amount 
 
 
 
  of bandwidth and receives net utility of 
 
 

the total amount of bandwidth available is 
 
 


We also use assumptions regarding 
 
 







 
  is increasing and concave


 
  is continuous

The game arises from trying to find a price 
 
 
 
  so that every player individually optimizes their own welfare. This implies every player must individually find 
 
 
 
 . Solving for the maximum yields

 
 .
The problem
With this maximum condition, the game then becomes a matter of finding a price that satisfies an equilibrium. Such a price is called a market clearing price.
A possible solution
A popular idea to find the price is a method called fair sharing.1 In this game, every player 
 
 
 
  is asked for amount they are willing to pay for the given resource denoted by 
 
 
 
 . The resource is then distributed in 
 
 
 
  amounts by the formula 
 
 
 
 . This method yields an effective price 
 
 
 
 . This price can proven to be market clearing thus the distribution 
 
 
 
  is optimal. The proof is as so:
Proof










Comparing this result to the equilibrium condition above, we see that when 
 
 
 
  is very small, the two conditions equal each other and thus, the fair sharing game is almost optimal.
