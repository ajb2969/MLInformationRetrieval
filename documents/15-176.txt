   Bandwidth-sharing game      Bandwidth-sharing game   A bandwidth-sharing game is a type of resource allocation game designed to model the real-world allocation of bandwidth to many users in a network. The game is popular in game theory because the conclusions can be applied to real-life networks. The game is described as follows:  The game      n   n   n   players  each player   i   i   i   has utility     U  i    (  x  )        subscript  U  i   x    U_{i}(x)   for amount   x   x   x   of bandwidth  user   i   i   i   pays    w  i     subscript  w  i    w_{i}   for amount   x   x   x   of bandwidth and receives net utility of      U  i    (  x  )    -   w  i          subscript  U  i   x    subscript  w  i     U_{i}(x)-w_{i}     the total amount of bandwidth available is   B   B   B      We also use assumptions regarding     U  i    (  x  )        subscript  U  i   x    U_{i}(x)            U  i    (  x  )    ≥  0         subscript  U  i   x   0    U_{i}(x)\geq 0          U  i    (  x  )        subscript  U  i   x    U_{i}(x)   is increasing and concave      U   (  x  )       U  x    U(x)   is continuous   The game arises from trying to find a price   p   p   p   so that every player individually optimizes their own welfare. This implies every player must individually find     a  r  g  m  a   x  x    U  i    (  x  )    -   p  x         a  r  g  m  a   subscript  x  x    subscript  U  i   x     p  x     argmax_{x}U_{i}(x)-px   . Solving for the maximum yields       U  i    ′     (  x  )    =  p         superscript   subscript  U  i    normal-′    x   p    U_{i}^{^{\prime}}(x)=p   .  The problem  With this maximum condition, the game then becomes a matter of finding a price that satisfies an equilibrium. Such a price is called a market clearing price .  A possible solution  A popular idea to find the price is a method called fair sharing. 1 In this game, every player   i   i   i   is asked for amount they are willing to pay for the given resource denoted by    w  i     subscript  w  i    w_{i}   . The resource is then distributed in    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   amounts by the formula     x  i   =    (    w  i      ∑  j     w  j     )   *   (  B  )         subscript  x  i        subscript  w  i     subscript   j    subscript  w  j     B     x_{i}=(\frac{w_{i}}{\sum_{j}w_{j}})*(B)   . This method yields an effective price    p  =      ∑  j     w  j    B       p      subscript   j    subscript  w  j    B     p=\frac{\sum_{j}w_{j}}{B}   . This price can proven to be market clearing thus the distribution     x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n       subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{1},...,x_{n}   is optimal. The proof is as so:  Proof       a  r  g  m  a   x   x  i     U  i    (   x  i   )    -   w  i         a  r  g  m  a   subscript  x   subscript  x  i     subscript  U  i    subscript  x  i     subscript  w  i     argmax_{x_{i}}U_{i}(x_{i})-w_{i}        ⟹    a  r  g  m  a   x   w  i     U  i    (     w  i      ∑  j     w  j     *  B   )    -   w  i        absent      a  r  g  m  a   subscript  x   subscript  w  i     subscript  U  i        subscript  w  i     subscript   j    subscript  w  j     B     subscript  w  i      \implies argmax_{w_{i}}U_{i}(\frac{w_{i}}{\sum_{j}w_{j}}*B)-w_{i}         ⟹     U  i    ′     (     w  i      ∑  j     w  j     *  B   )    (     1     ∑  j     w  j     *  B   -     w  i     (     ∑  j     w  j    )   2    *  B    )    -  1   =  0        absent       subscript   superscript  U   normal-′    i        subscript  w  i     subscript   j    subscript  w  j     B         1    subscript   j    subscript  w  j     B        subscript  w  i    superscript    subscript   j    subscript  w  j    2    B     1        0     \implies U^{^{\prime}}_{i}(\frac{w_{i}}{\sum_{j}w_{j}}*B)(\frac{1}{\sum_{j}w_{%
 j}}*B-\frac{w_{i}}{(\sum_{j}w_{j})^{2}}*B)-1=0         ⟹     U  i    ′     (   x  i   )    (    1  p   -    1  p   *    x  i   B     )    -  1   =  0        absent       subscript   superscript  U   normal-′    i    subscript  x  i       1  p       1  p      subscript  x  i   B      1        0     \implies U^{^{\prime}}_{i}(x_{i})(\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{p}*\frac{x_{i}}{B})-1=0         ⟹    U  i    ′     (   x  i   )    (   1  -    x  i   B    )    =  p        absent     subscript   superscript  U   normal-′    i    subscript  x  i     1     subscript  x  i   B          p     \implies U^{^{\prime}}_{i}(x_{i})(1-\frac{x_{i}}{B})=p     Comparing this result to the equilibrium condition above, we see that when     x  i   B       subscript  x  i   B    \frac{x_{i}}{B}   is very small, the two conditions equal each other and thus, the fair sharing game is almost optimal.
