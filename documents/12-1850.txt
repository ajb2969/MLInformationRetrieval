ATS theorem

In mathematics, the ATS theorem is the theorem on the approximation of a trigonometric sum by a shorter one. The application of the ATS theorem in certain problems of mathematical and theoretical physics can be very helpful.
History of the problem
In some fields of mathematics and mathematical physics, sums of the form


 
  and 
 
 
 
  are real valued functions of a real argument, and 
 
 
 
  Such sums appear, for example, in number theory in the analysis of the Riemann zeta function, in the solution of problems connected with integer points in the domains on plane and in space, in the study of the Fourier series, and in the solution of such differential equations as the wave equation, the potential equation, the heat conductivity equation.
The problem of approximation of the series (1) by a suitable function was studied already by Euler and Poisson.
We shall define the length of the sum 
 
 
 to be the number 
 
 
 
  (for the integers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  this is the number of the summands in 
 
 
 
 ).
Under certain conditions on 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the sum 
 
 
 
  can be substituted with good accuracy by another sum 
 
 



 
  is far less than 
 
 

First relations of the form



where 
 
 

 
  are the sums (1) and (2) respectively, 
 
 
 
  is a remainder term, with concrete functions 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  were obtained by G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood,123 when they deduced approximate functional equation for the Riemann zeta function 
 
 
 
  and by I. M. Vinogradov,4 in the study of the amounts of integer points in the domains on plane. In general form the theorem was proved by J. Van der Corput,56 (on the recent results connected with the Van der Corput theorem one can read at 7).
In every one of the above-mentioned works, some restrictions on the functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  were imposed. With convenient (for applications) restrictions on 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the theorem was proved by A. A. Karatsuba in 8 (see also,910).

The most simple variant of the formulated theorem is the statement, which is called in the literature the Van der Corput lemma.
