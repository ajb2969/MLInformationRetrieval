   1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ⋯      1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ⋯   In mathematics , 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + … is the infinite series whose terms are the successive powers of two . As a geometric series , it is characterized by its first term, 1, and its common ratio , 2. As a series of real numbers it diverges to infinity , so in the usual sense it has no sum. In a much broader sense, the series is associated with another value besides ∞, namely −1.  Summation  The partial sums of 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + … are  since these diverge to infinity, so does the series. Therefore any totally regular summation method gives a sum of infinity, including the Cesàro sum and Abel sum . 1 On the other hand, there is at least one generally useful method that sums  to the finite value of −1. The associated power series       f   (  x  )    =   1  +   2  x   +   4   x  2    +   8   x  3    +  ⋯  +    2  n    x  n    +  ⋯   =   1   1  -   2  x             f  x     1    2  x     4   superscript  x  2      8   superscript  x  3    normal-⋯     superscript  2  n    superscript  x  n    normal-⋯          1    1    2  x        f(x)=1+2x+4x^{2}+8x^{3}+\cdots+2^{n}{}x^{n}+\cdots=\frac{1}{1-2x}     has a radius of convergence around 0 of only 1 / 2 , so it does not converge at . Nonetheless, the so-defined function f has a unique analytic continuation to the complex plane with the point deleted, and it is given by the same rule . Since , the original series  is said to be summable ( E ) to −1, and −1 is the ( E ) sum of the series. (The notation is due to G. H. Hardy in reference to Leonhard Euler 's approach to divergent series ). 2  An almost identical approach (the one taken by Euler himself) is to consider the power series whose coefficients are all 1, i.e.       1  +  y  +   y  2   +   y  3   +  ⋯   =   1   1  -  y          1  y   superscript  y  2    superscript  y  3   normal-⋯     1    1  y      1+y+y^{2}+y^{3}+\cdots=\frac{1}{1-y}     and plugging in y = 2. Of course these two series are related by the substitution y = 2 x .  The fact that ( E ) summation assigns a finite value to  shows that the general method is not totally regular. On the other hand, it possesses some other desirable qualities for a summation method, including stability and linearity. These latter two axioms actually force the sum to be −1, since they make the following manipulation valid:        s    =     1  +  2  +  4  +  8  +  ⋯        =     1  +   2   (   1  +  2  +  4  +  8  +  ⋯   )          =     1  +   2  s          s     1  2  4  8  normal-⋯      missing-subexpression      1    2    1  2  4  8  normal-⋯        missing-subexpression      1    2  s       \begin{array}[]{rcl}s&=&\displaystyle 1+2+4+8+\cdots\\
 &=&\displaystyle 1+2(1+2+4+8+\cdots)\\
 &=&\displaystyle 1+2s\end{array}     In a useful sense, s = ∞ is a root of the equation  (For example, ∞ is one of the two fixed points of the Möbius transformation on the Riemann sphere ). If some summation method is known to return an ordinary number for s , i.e. not ∞, then it is easily determined. In this case s may be subtracted from both sides of the equation, yielding , so . 3  The above manipulation might be called on to produce −1 outside the context of a sufficiently powerful summation procedure. For the most well-known and straightforward sum concepts, including the fundamental convergent one, it is absurd that a series of positive terms could have a negative value. A similar phenomenon occurs with the divergent geometric series 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · , where a series of integers appears to have the non-integer sum 1 ⁄ 2 . These examples illustrate the potential danger in applying similar arguments to the series implied by such recurring decimals as 0.111… and most notably 0.999… . The arguments are ultimately justified for these convergent series, implying that and , but the underlying proofs demand careful thinking about the interpretation of endless sums. 4  It is also possible to view this series as convergent in a number system different from the real numbers, namely, the 2-adic numbers . As a series of 2-adic numbers this series converges to the same sum, −1, as was derived above by analytic continuation. 5  See also   1 − 1 + 2 − 6 + 24 − 120 + · · ·  1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + · · ·  Two's complement , a data convention for representing negative numbers where    -  1      1    -1   is represented as if it were    1  +  2  +  4  +  …  +   2   n  -  1        1  2  4  normal-…   superscript  2    n  1      1+2+4+\ldots+2^{n-1}   .
