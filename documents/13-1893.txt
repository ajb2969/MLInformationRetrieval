Fox H-function

In mathematics, the Fox H-function H(x) is a generalization of the Meijer G-function introduced by . It is defined by a Mellinâ€“Barnes integral


 
  where L is a certain contour separating the poles of the two factors in the numerator. Another generalization of Fox H-function is given by Innayat Hussain . For a further generalization of this function, useful in Physics and Statistics, see .
The special case for which the Fox H-function reduces to the Meijer G-function is Aj = Bk = C, C > 0 for j = 1...p and k = 1...q :
