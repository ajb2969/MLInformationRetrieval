   Laue equations      Laue equations   In crystallography , the Laue equations give three conditions for incident waves to be diffracted by a crystal lattice . They are named after physicist Max von Laue (1879 — 1960). They reduce to Bragg's law .  Equations  Take    𝐤  i     subscript  𝐤  i    \mathbf{k}_{i}   to be the wavevector for the incoming (incident) beam and    𝐤  o     subscript  𝐤  o    \mathbf{k}_{o}   to be the wavevector for the outgoing (diffracted) beam.      𝐤  o   -   𝐤  i    =   𝚫  𝐤          subscript  𝐤  o    subscript  𝐤  i      𝚫  𝐤     \mathbf{k}_{o}-\mathbf{k}_{i}=\mathbf{\Delta k}   is the scattering vector (also called transferred wavevector) and measures the change between the two wavevectors.  Take     𝐚   ,   𝐛   ,  𝐜     𝐚  𝐛  𝐜    \mathbf{a}\,,\mathbf{b}\,,\mathbf{c}   to be the primitive vectors of the crystal lattice. The three Laue conditions for the scattering vector, or the Laue equations, for integer values of a reflection's reciprocal lattice  indices (h,k,l) are as follows:        𝐚  ⋅  𝚫   𝐤   =   2  π  h          normal-⋅  𝐚  𝚫   𝐤     2  π  h     \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{\Delta k}=2\pi h           𝐛  ⋅  𝚫   𝐤   =   2  π  k          normal-⋅  𝐛  𝚫   𝐤     2  π  k     \mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{\Delta k}=2\pi k           𝐜  ⋅  𝚫   𝐤   =   2  π  l          normal-⋅  𝐜  𝚫   𝐤     2  π  l     \mathbf{c}\cdot\mathbf{\Delta k}=2\pi l     These conditions say that the scattering vector must be oriented in a specific direction in relation to the primitive vectors of the crystal lattice.  Relation to Bragg Law  If    𝐆  =    h  𝐀   +   k  𝐁   +   l  𝐂        𝐆      h  𝐀     k  𝐁     l  𝐂      \mathbf{G}=h\mathbf{A}+k\mathbf{B}+l\mathbf{C}   is the reciprocal lattice vector , we know     𝐆  ⋅   (   𝐚  +  𝐛  +  𝐜   )    =   2  π   (   h  +  k  +  l   )         normal-⋅  𝐆    𝐚  𝐛  𝐜      2  π    h  k  l      \mathbf{G}\cdot(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c})=2\pi(h+k+l)   . The Laue equations specify      𝚫  𝐤   ⋅   (   𝐚  +  𝐛  +  𝐜   )    =   2  π   (   h  +  k  +  l   )         normal-⋅    𝚫  𝐤     𝐚  𝐛  𝐜      2  π    h  k  l      \mathbf{\Delta k}\cdot(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c})=2\pi(h+k+l)   . Hence we have     𝚫  𝐤   =  𝐆        𝚫  𝐤   𝐆    \mathbf{\Delta k}=\mathbf{G}   or      𝐤  o   -   𝐤  i    =  𝐆         subscript  𝐤  o    subscript  𝐤  i    𝐆    \mathbf{k}_{o}-\mathbf{k}_{i}=\mathbf{G}   .  From this we get the diffraction condition :       𝐤  o   -   𝐤  i        subscript  𝐤  o    subscript  𝐤  i     \displaystyle\mathbf{k}_{o}-\mathbf{k}_{i}     Since      (   𝐤  o   )   2   =    (   𝐤  i   )   2        superscript   subscript  𝐤  o   2    superscript   subscript  𝐤  i   2     (\mathbf{k}_{o})^{2}=(\mathbf{k}_{i})^{2}   (considering elastic scattering) and    𝐆  =   -  𝐆       𝐆    𝐆     \mathbf{G}=-\mathbf{G}   (a negative reciprocal lattice vector is still a reciprocal lattice vector):        2   𝐤  i    ⋅  𝐆   =   G  2        normal-⋅    2   subscript  𝐤  i    𝐆    superscript  G  2     2\mathbf{k}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{G}=G^{2}   .  The diffraction condition      2   𝐤  i    ⋅  𝐆   =   G  2        normal-⋅    2   subscript  𝐤  i    𝐆    superscript  G  2     \;2\mathbf{k}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{G}=G^{2}   reduces to the Bragg law      2  d   sin  θ    =   n  λ         2  d    θ      n  λ     \;2d\sin\theta=n\lambda   .
