Laue equations

 In crystallography, the Laue equations give three conditions for incident waves to be diffracted by a crystal lattice. They are named after physicist Max von Laue (1879 â€” 1960). They reduce to Bragg's law.
Equations
Take 
 
 
 
  to be the wavevector for the incoming (incident) beam and 
 
 
 
  to be the wavevector for the outgoing (diffracted) beam. 
 
 
 
  is the scattering vector (also called transferred wavevector) and measures the change between the two wavevectors.
Take 
 
 
 
  to be the primitive vectors of the crystal lattice. The three Laue conditions for the scattering vector, or the Laue equations, for integer values of a reflection's reciprocal lattice indices (h,k,l) are as follows:









These conditions say that the scattering vector must be oriented in a specific direction in relation to the primitive vectors of the crystal lattice.
Relation to Bragg Law
If 
 
 
 
  is the reciprocal lattice vector, we know 
 
 
 
 . The Laue equations specify 
 
 
 
 . Hence we have 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 .
From this we get the diffraction condition:



Since 
 
 
 
  (considering elastic scattering) and 
 
 
 
  (a negative reciprocal lattice vector is still a reciprocal lattice vector):


 
 .
The diffraction condition 
 
 
 
  reduces to the Bragg law
