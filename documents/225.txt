   Wavelet transform      Wavelet transform   (Figure)  An example of the 2D discrete wavelet transform that is used in JPEG2000 .   In mathematics , a wavelet series is a representation of a square-integrable ( real - or complex -valued) function by a certain orthonormal  series generated by a wavelet . Nowadays, wavelet transformation is one of the most popular candidates of the time-frequency-transformations. This article provides a formal, mathematical definition of an orthonormal wavelet and of the integral wavelet transform .  Definition  A function     ψ   ∈    L  2    (  ℝ  )        ψ     superscript  L  2   ℝ     \scriptstyle\psi\,\in\,L^{2}(\mathbb{R})   is called an orthonormal wavelet if it can be used to define a Hilbert basis , that is a complete  orthonormal system , for the Hilbert space      L  2    (  ℝ  )        superscript  L  2   ℝ    \scriptstyle L^{2}\left(\mathbb{R}\right)   of square integrable functions.  The Hilbert basis is constructed as the family of functions    {   ψ   j  k    :    j  ,   k    ∈   \Z    }     conditional-set   subscript  ψ    j  k       j  k   \Z     \scriptstyle\{\psi_{jk}:\,j,\,k\,\in\,\Z\}   by means of dyadic  translations and dilations of    ψ    ψ   \scriptstyle\psi\,   ,        ψ   j  k     (  x  )    =    2   j  2    ψ   (     2  j   x   -  k   )           subscript  ψ    j  k    x      superscript  2    j  2    ψ       superscript  2  j   x   k      \psi_{jk}(x)=2^{\frac{j}{2}}\psi\left(2^{j}x-k\right)\,     for integers     j  ,   k    ∈  ℤ       j  k   ℤ    \scriptstyle j,\,k\,\in\,\mathbb{Z}   .  If under the standard inner product on     L  2    (  ℝ  )        superscript  L  2   ℝ    \scriptstyle L^{2}\left(\mathbb{R}\right)   ,       ⟨  f  ,  g  ⟩   =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞    f   (  x  )     g   (  x  )    ¯   d  x         f  g     superscript   subscript            f  x   normal-¯    g  x    d  x      \langle f,g\rangle=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)\overline{g(x)}dx     this family is orthonormal, it is an orthonormal system:      ⟨   ψ   j  k    ,   ψ   l  m    ⟩      subscript  ψ    j  k     subscript  ψ    l  m      \displaystyle\langle\psi_{jk},\psi_{lm}\rangle     where     δ   j  l       subscript  δ    j  l     \scriptstyle\delta_{jl}\,   is the Kronecker delta .  Completeness is satisfied if every function     h   ∈    L  2    (  ℝ  )        h     superscript  L  2   ℝ     \scriptstyle h\,\in\,L^{2}\left(\mathbb{R}\right)   may be expanded in the basis as       h   (  x  )    =    ∑    j  ,  k   =   -  ∞    ∞     c   j  k     ψ   j  k     (  x  )           h  x     superscript   subscript      j  k              subscript  c    j  k     subscript  ψ    j  k    x      h(x)=\sum_{j,k=-\infty}^{\infty}c_{jk}\psi_{jk}(x)     with convergence of the series understood to be convergence in norm . Such a representation of a function f is known as a wavelet series . This implies that an orthonormal wavelet is self-dual .  Wavelet transform  The integral wavelet transform is the integral transform defined as        [    W  ψ   f   ]    (  a  ,  b  )    =    1    |  a  |       ∫   -  ∞   ∞      ψ   (    x  -  b   a   )    ¯   f   (  x  )   d   x             delimited-[]     subscript  W  ψ   f     a  b        1      a       superscript   subscript             normal-¯    ψ      x  b   a     f  x  d  x       \left[W_{\psi}f\right](a,b)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{|a|}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}%
 \overline{\psi\left(\frac{x-b}{a}\right)}f(x)dx\,     The wavelet coefficients     c   j  k      subscript  c    j  k     \scriptstyle c_{jk}   are then given by       c   j  k    =    [    W  ψ   f   ]    (   2   -  j    ,   k   2   -  j     )         subscript  c    j  k       delimited-[]     subscript  W  ψ   f      superscript  2    j      k   superscript  2    j         c_{jk}=\left[W_{\psi}f\right]\left(2^{-j},k2^{-j}\right)     Here,     a   =   2   -  j        a   superscript  2    j      \scriptstyle a\;=\;2^{-j}   is called the binary dilation or dyadic dilation , and     b   =   k   2   -  j         b    k   superscript  2    j       \scriptstyle b\;=\;k2^{-j}   is the binary or dyadic position .  Basic idea  The fundamental idea of wavelet transforms is that the transformation should allow only changes in time extension, but not shape. This is effected by choosing suitable basis functions that allow for this. Changes in the time extension are expected to conform to the corresponding analysis frequency of the basis function. Based on the uncertainty principle of signal processing,       Δ  t  Δ  ω   ≧   1  2         normal-Δ  t  normal-Δ  ω     1  2     \Delta t\Delta\omega\geqq\frac{1}{2}     where t represents time and ω angular frequency (ω = 2πf, where f is temporal frequency).  The higher the required resolution in time, the lower the resolution in frequency has to be. The larger the extension of the analysis windows is chosen, the larger is the value of    Δ  t      normal-Δ  t    \scriptstyle\Delta t   .  (Figure)  Basis function with compression factor.jpg   When Δt is large,   Bad time resolution  Good frequency resolution  Low frequency, large scaling factor   When Δt is small   Good time resolution  Bad frequency resolution  High frequency, small scaling factor   In other words, the basis function Ψ can be regarded as an impulse response of a system with which the function x(t) has been filtered. The transformed signal provides information about the time and the frequency. Therefore, wavelet-transformation contains information similar to the short-time-Fourier-transformation , but with additional special properties of the wavelets, which show up at the resolution in time at higher analysis frequencies of the basis function. The difference in time resolution at ascending frequencies for the Fourier transform and the wavelet transform is shown below.  (Figure)  STFT and WT.jpg   This shows that wavelet transformation is good in time resolution of high frequencies, while for slowly varying functions, the frequency resolution is remarkable.

(Figure)  Analysis of three superposed sinusoidal signals.jpg   Wavelet compression  Wavelet compression is a form of data compression well suited for image compression (sometimes also video compression and audio compression ). Notable implementations are JPEG 2000 , DjVu and ECW for still images, CineForm , and the BBC's Dirac . The goal is to store image data in as little space as possible in a file . Wavelet compression can be either lossless or lossy . 1  Using a wavelet transform, the wavelet compression methods are adequate for representing transients , such as percussion sounds in audio, or high-frequency components in two-dimensional images, for example an image of stars on a night sky. This means that the transient elements of a data signal can be represented by a smaller amount of information than would be the case if some other transform, such as the more widespread discrete cosine transform , had been used.  Wavelet compression is not good for all kinds of data: transient signal characteristics mean good wavelet compression, while smooth, periodic signals are better compressed by other methods, particularly traditional harmonic compression (frequency domain, as by Fourier transforms and related).  See Diary Of An x264 Developer: The problems with wavelets (2010) for discussion of practical issues of current methods using wavelets for video compression.  Method  First a wavelet transform is applied. This produces as many coefficients as there are pixels in the image (i.e., there is no compression yet since it is only a transform). These coefficients can then be compressed more easily because the information is statistically concentrated in just a few coefficients. This principle is called transform coding . After that, the coefficients are quantized and the quantized values are entropy encoded and/or run length encoded .  A few 1D and 2D applications of wavelet compression use a technique called "wavelet footprints".  N. Malmurugan, A. Shanmugam, S. Jayaraman and V. V. Dinesh Chander.

For instance, signal processing of accelerations for gait analysis, 4 for fault detection, 5 for design of low power pacemakers and also in ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless communications. 6  \cdot\Psi\left[\frac{k - m c_0^n}{c_0^n}T\right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{c_0^n}}\cdot\Psi\left[\left(\frac{k}{c_0^n} - m\right)T\right]  Such discrete wavelets can be used for the transformation:        Y   D  W     (  n  ,  m  )    =    1    c  0  n     ⋅    ∑   k  =  0    K  -  1       y   (  k  )    ⋅  Ψ    [    (    k   c  0  n    -  m   )   T   ]             subscript  Y    D  W     n  m     normal-⋅    1     superscript   subscript  c  0   n       superscript   subscript     k  0      K  1       normal-⋅    y  k   normal-Ψ    delimited-[]        k   superscript   subscript  c  0   n    m   T         Y_{DW}(n,m)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{c_{0}^{n}}}\cdot\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}y(k)\cdot\Psi\left[%
