   Trans-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase      Trans-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a trans-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   trans-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   catechol + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are trans-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol and NADP + , whereas its three products are catechol , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is trans-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol:NADP+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called dihydrodiol dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p450 .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 14 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
