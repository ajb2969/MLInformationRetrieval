   3,4-dihydroxy-9,10-secoandrosta-1,3,5(10)-triene-9,17-dione 4,5-dioxygenase      3,4-dihydroxy-9,10-secoandrosta-1,3,5(10)-triene-9,17-dione 4,5-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a 3,4-dihydroxy-9,10-secoandrosta-1,3,5(10)-triene-9,17-dione 4,5-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3,4-dihydroxy-9,10-secoandrosta-1,3,5(10)-triene-9,17-dione + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-hydroxy-5,9,17-trioxo-4,5:9,10-disecoandrosta-1(10),2-dien-4-oate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3,4-dihydroxy-9,10-secoandrosta-1,3,5(10)-triene-9,17-dione and O 2 , whereas its product is 3-hydroxy-5,9,17-trioxo-4,5:9,10-disecoandrosta-1(10),2-dien-4-oate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3,4-dihydroxy-9,10-secoandrosta-1,3,5(10)-triene-9,17-dione:oxygen 4,5-oxidoreductase (decyclizing) . Other names in common use include steroid 4,5-dioxygenase , and 3-alkylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase . It employs one cofactor , iron .
