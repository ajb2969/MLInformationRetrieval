MRNA (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase




MRNA (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a mRNA (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase also known as mRNA cap guanine-N7 methyltransferase is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + G(5')pppR-RNA 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + m7G(5')pppR-RNA (mRNA containing an N7-methylguanine cap)
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and G(5')pppR-RNA, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and m7G(5')pppR-RNA. This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases.
In humans, mRNA cap guanine-N7 methyltransferase is encoded by the RNMT gene.123
Nomenclature
The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:mRNA (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include:

messenger ribonucleate guanine 7-methyltransferase,
guanine-7-methyltransferase,
messenger RNA guanine 7-methyltransferase, and
S-adenosyl-L-methionine:mRNA (guanine-7-N-)-methyltransferase.
