   Uronolactonase      Uronolactonase   In enzymology , an uronolactonase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-glucurono-6,2-lactone + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucuronate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-glucurono-6,2-lactone and H 2 O , whereas its product is D-glucuronate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glucurono-6,2-lactone lactonohydrolase . This enzyme is also called glucuronolactonase . This enzyme participates in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
