23S rRNA (pseudouridine1915-N3)-methyltransferase

23S rRNA (pseudouridine1915-N3)-methyltransferase (, YbeA, RlmH, pseudouridine methyltransferase, m3Psi methyltransferase, Psi1915-specific methyltransferase, rRNA large subunit methyltransferase H) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (pseudouridine1915-N3)-methyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + pseudouridine1915 in 23S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N3-methylpseudouridine1915 in 23S rRNA
 

YbeA does not methylate uridine at position 1915.
