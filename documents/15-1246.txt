   23S rRNA (pseudouridine1915-N3)-methyltransferase      23S rRNA (pseudouridine1915-N3)-methyltransferase   23S rRNA (pseudouridine 1915 -N 3 )-methyltransferase (, YbeA , RlmH , pseudouridine methyltransferase , m3Psi methyltransferase , Psi1915-specific methyltransferase , rRNA large subunit methyltransferase H ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (pseudouridine 1915 -N 3 )-methyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + pseudouridine 1915 in 23S rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 3 -methylpseudouridine 1915 in 23S rRNA   YbeA does not methylate uridine at position 1915.
