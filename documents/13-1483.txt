   List of earthquakes in Cuba      List of earthquakes in Cuba    Cuba is located in an area with several active fault systems which produce on average about 2000 seismic events each year. 1 While most registered seismic events pass unnoticed, the island has been struck by a number of destructive earthquakes over the past four centuries, including several major quakes with a magnitude of 7.0 or above.  Approximately 70% of seismic activity in Cuba emanates from the Oriente fault zone , located in the Bartlett-Cayman fault system which runs along the south-eastern coast of Cuba and marks the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate . 2 The 12 currently active faults in Cuba also include the Cauto-Nipe , Cochinos and Nortecubana faults. 3 Destructive earthquakes originating from the Oriente fault occurred in 1766 (    M  i     subscript  M  i    M_{i}   =7.6), 1852 (    M  i     subscript  M  i    M_{i}   =7.2) and 1932 (    M  s     subscript  M  s    M_{s}   =6.75). 4 Some studies suggest there is a high probability the Oriente fault will produce a magnitude 7 earthquake in the near future. 5 Notable earthquakes in recent Cuban history include the following:       Name   Date   Epicentre   M   Intensity   Depth   Notes   Deaths       style 1578 Cuba earthquake   style 157808000000 August 1578    style Santiago de Cuba 6   style 6.8   VIII   30 km   Magnitude estimated at 6.8 M L on the Richter scale , intensity at VIII EMS-98 . 7      style 1580 Cuba earthquake   style 158012190000 1580-12-19    style Santiago de Cuba  8   style         1632 Cuba earthquake   163210000000 October 1632    Santiago de Cuba  9          1675 Cuba earthquake   167502110000 1675-02-11    Santiago de Cuba  10 11   5.8   VII   30 km   Magnitude estimated at 5.8 M L on the Richter scale , intensity at VII EMS-98 . 12      1678 Cuba earthquake   167802110000 1678-02-11 14:59   Santiago de Cuba  13   6.8   VIII   30 km   Magnitude estimated at 6.8 M L on the Richter scale , intensity at VIII EMS-98 . 14      1679 Cuba earthquake   167902110000 1679-02-11    Santiago de Cuba  15          1682 Cuba earthquake   168200000000 1682    Santiago de Cuba  16   5.8   VII   30 km   Magnitude estimated at 5.8 M L on the Richter scale , intensity at VII EMS-98 . 17      1693 Cuba earthquake   169307000000 July 1693    Havana 18      "1,500 houses thrown down"      1757 Cuba earthquake   175712140000 1757-12-14    Santiago de Cuba  19          1766 Cuba earthquake   176606110000 1766-06-11 05:14   Santiago de Cuba  20   7.6    M  i     subscript  M  i    M_{i}    21   IX   35 km   Magnitude estimated at 7.6 M L on the Richter scale , intensity at IX EMS-98 . 22   120     1826 Cuba earthquake   182609180000 1826-09-18 09:26   Santiago de Cuba  23   5.8   VII   30 km   Magnitude estimated at 5.8 M L on the Richter scale , intensity at VII EMS-98 . 24      1842 Cuba earthquake   184207070000 1842-07-07    Santiago de Cuba 25   6.0   VII   30 km   Magnitude estimated at 6.0 M L on the Richter scale , intensity at VII EMS-98 . 26      1852 Cuba earthquake   18520921405 1852-08-20 14:05 UTC   Santiago de Cuba  27 28   7.2    M  i     subscript  M  i    M_{i}    29   IX   30 km   Magnitude intensity estimated at IX EMS-98 , 30 with 26 heavy aftershocks.
