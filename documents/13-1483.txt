List of earthquakes in Cuba

 Cuba is located in an area with several active fault systems which produce on average about 2000 seismic events each year.1 While most registered seismic events pass unnoticed, the island has been struck by a number of destructive earthquakes over the past four centuries, including several major quakes with a magnitude of 7.0 or above.
Approximately 70% of seismic activity in Cuba emanates from the Oriente fault zone, located in the Bartlett-Cayman fault system which runs along the south-eastern coast of Cuba and marks the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate.2 The 12 currently active faults in Cuba also include the Cauto-Nipe, Cochinos and Nortecubana faults.3 Destructive earthquakes originating from the Oriente fault occurred in 1766 (
 
 
 
 =7.6), 1852 (
 
 
 
 =7.2) and 1932 (
 
 
 
 =6.75).4 Some studies suggest there is a high probability the Oriente fault will produce a magnitude 7 earthquake in the near future.5  Notable earthquakes in recent Cuban history include the following:
