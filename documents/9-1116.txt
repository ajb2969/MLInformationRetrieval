   Positive form      Positive form   In complex geometry , the term positive form refers to several classes of real differential forms of Hodge type  (p, p) .  (1,1)-forms  Real ( p , p )-forms on a complex manifold M are forms which are of type ( p , p ) and real, that is, lie in the intersection       Λ   p  ,  p     (  M  )    ∩    Λ   2  p     (  M  ,  ℝ  )     .         superscript  normal-Λ   p  p    M      superscript  normal-Λ    2  p     M  ℝ      \Lambda^{p,p}(M)\cap\Lambda^{2p}(M,{\mathbb{R}}).   A real (1,1)-form   ω   ω   \omega   is called positive if any of the following equivalent conditions hold       -  ω      ω    -\omega   is an imaginary part of a positive (not necessarily positive definite) Hermitian form .  For some basis     d   z  1    ,   …  d   z  n         d   subscript  z  1      normal-…  d   subscript  z  n      dz_{1},...dz_{n}   in the space     Λ   1  ,  0    M       superscript  normal-Λ   1  0    M    \Lambda^{1,0}M   of (1,0)-forms,      -  1    ω          1    ω    \sqrt{-1}\omega   can be written diagonally, as        -  1    ω   =     ∑  i     α  i   d   z  i     ∧   d    z  ¯   i      ,            1    ω       subscript   i      subscript  α  i   d   subscript  z  i       d   subscript   normal-¯  z   i       \sqrt{-1}\omega=\sum_{i}\alpha_{i}dz_{i}\wedge d\bar{z}_{i},   with    α  i     subscript  α  i    \alpha_{i}   real and non-negative.  For any (1,0)-tangent vector    v  ∈    T   1  ,  0    M       v     superscript  T   1  0    M     v\in T^{1,0}M   ,     -     -  1    ω   (  v  ,   v  ¯   )     ≥  0              1    ω   v   normal-¯  v      0    -\sqrt{-1}\omega(v,\bar{v})\geq 0     For any real tangent vector    v  ∈   T  M       v    T  M     v\in TM   ,     ω   (  v  ,   I   (  v  )    )    ≥  0        ω   v    I  v     0    \omega(v,I(v))\geq 0   , where    I  :    T  M   ↦   T  M       normal-:  I   maps-to    T  M     T  M      I:\;TM\mapsto TM   is the complex structure operator.   Positive line bundles  In algebraic geometry, positive (1,1)-forms arise as curvature forms of ample line bundles (also known as positive line bundles ). Let L be a holomorphic Hermitian line bundle on a complex manifold,       ∂  ¯   :   L  ↦    L  ⊗   Λ   0  ,  1      (  M  )        normal-:   normal-¯     maps-to  L     tensor-product  L   superscript  normal-Λ   0  1     M      \bar{\partial}:\;L\mapsto L\otimes\Lambda^{0,1}(M)     its complex structure operator. Then L is equipped with a unique connection preserving the Hermitian structure and satisfying       ∇   0  ,  1    =   ∂  ¯        superscript  normal-∇   0  1     normal-¯      \nabla^{0,1}=\bar{\partial}   .  This connection is called the Chern connection .  The curvature   Θ   normal-Θ   \Theta   of a Chern connection is always a purely imaginary (1,1)-form. A line bundle L is called positive if        -  1    Θ          1    normal-Θ    \sqrt{-1}\Theta     is a positive definite (1,1)-form. The Kodaira embedding theorem claims that a positive line bundle is ample, and conversely, any ample line bundle admits a Hermitian metric with      -  1    Θ          1    normal-Θ    \sqrt{-1}\Theta   positive.  Positivity for (p, p) -forms  Positive (1,1)-forms on M form a convex cone . When M is a compact complex surface ,     d  i   m  ℂ   M   =  2        d  i   subscript  m  ℂ   M   2    dim_{\mathbb{C}}M=2   , this cone is self-dual , with respect to the Poincaré pairing     η  ,  ζ   ↦     ∫  M   η   ∧  ζ      maps-to   η  ζ       subscript   M   η   ζ     \eta,\zeta\mapsto\int_{M}\eta\wedge\zeta     For (p, p) -forms, where    2  ≤  p  ≤    d  i   m  ℂ   M   -  2         2  p           d  i   subscript  m  ℂ   M   2      2\leq p\leq dim_{\mathbb{C}}M-2   , there are two different notions of positivity. A form is called strongly positive if it is a linear combination of products of positive forms, with positive real coefficients. A real (p, p) -form   η   η   \eta   on an n -dimensional complex manifold M is called weakly positive if for all strongly positive (n-p, n-p) -forms ζ with compact support, we have       ∫  M   η   ∧  ζ   ≥  0          subscript   M   η   ζ   0    \int_{M}\eta\wedge\zeta\geq 0   .  Weakly positive and strongly positive forms form convex cones. On compact manifolds these cones are dual with respect to the Poincaré pairing.
