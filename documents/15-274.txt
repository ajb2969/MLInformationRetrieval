   Zuc stream cipher      Zuc stream cipher   ZUC is a new stream cipher due for possible inclusion in the Long Term Evolution standards for mobile devices. 1  It uses a 16-stage Linear Feedback Shift Register ( LFSR ) with each stage in GF(     2  31   -  1       superscript  2  31   1    2^{31}-1   ) and produces a 32-bit word on each tick.
