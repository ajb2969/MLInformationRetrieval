   Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture      Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture   In mathematics, Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture is a conjecture made by  that the pair correlation between pairs of zeros of the Riemann zeta function (normalized to have unit average spacing) is        1  -    (    sin   (   π  u   )     π  u    )   2    +   δ   (  u  )     ,        1   superscript        π  u      π  u    2      δ  u     1-\left(\frac{\sin(\pi u)}{\pi u}\right)^{2}+\delta(u),   which, as Freeman Dyson pointed out to him, is the same as the pair correlation function of random Hermitian matrices . Informally, this means that the chance of finding a zero in a very short interval of length 2π L /log( T ) at a distance 2π u /log( T ) from a zero 1/2+ iT is about L times the expression above. (The factor 2π/log( T ) is a normalization factor that can be thought of informally as the average spacing between zeros with imaginary part about T .)  showed that the conjecture was supported by large-scale computer calculations of the zeros. The conjecture has been extended to correlations of more than 2 zeros, and also to zeta functions of automorphic representations . In 1982 a student of Montgomery's, Ali Erhan Özlük, proved the pair correlation conjecture for some of Dirichlet's L-functions.  The connection with random unitary matrices could lead to a proof of the Riemann hypothesis . The Hilbert–Pólya conjecture asserts that the zeros of the Riemann Zeta function correspond to the eigenvalues of a linear operator, and implies RH. Some people think this is a promising approach ().  Montgomery was studying the Fourier transform  F ( x ) of the pair correlation function, and showed (assuming the Riemann hypothesis) that it was equal to | x | for | x |5 zeros.]]  In the 1980s, motivated by the Montgomery's conjecture, Odlyzko began an intensive numerical study of the statistics of the zeros of ζ(s). He confirmed that the distribution of the spacings between non-trivial zeros using detail numerical calculation and demonstrated that the Montgomery's conjecture would be true and the distribution would agree with the distribution of spacings of GUE random matrix eigenvalues using Cray X-MP . In 1987 he reported the calculations in the paper .  For non trivial zero, 1/2+iγ n , let the normalized spacings be        δ  n   =    (    γ   n  +  1    -   γ  n    )     log    γ  n    2  π      2  π      .       subscript  δ  n        subscript  γ    n  1     subscript  γ  n           subscript  γ  n     2  π       2  π       \delta_{n}=(\gamma_{n+1}-\gamma_{n})\frac{\log{\frac{\gamma_{n}}{2\pi}}}{2\pi}.   Then we would expect the following formula as the limit, M, N →∞. Then       1  M    {   (  n  ,  k  )   |  N  ≤  n  ≤  N  +  M  ,      fragments    1  M    fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-(  n  normal-,  k  normal-)   normal-|  N   n   N   M  normal-,     \frac{1}{M}\{(n,k)|N\leq n\leq N+M,\,           k  ≥  0  ,   δ  n   +   δ   n  +  1    +  ⋯  +   δ   n  +  k    ∈   [  α  ,  β  ]   }     fragments  k   0  normal-,   subscript  δ  n     subscript  δ    n  1     normal-⋯    subscript  δ    n  k      fragments  normal-[  α  normal-,  β  normal-]   normal-}    k\geq 0,\,\delta_{n}+\delta_{n+1}+\cdots+\delta_{n+k}\in[\alpha,\beta]\}      \sim \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \left (         1- \biggl ( \frac{\sin{\pi u}}{\pi u} \biggr )^2 \right ) du  Based on a new algorithm developed by Odlyzko and Schönhage that allowed them to compute a value of ζ(1/2 + it) in an average time of t ε steps, Odlyzko computed millions of zeros at heights around 10 20 and gave some evidence for the GUE conjecture. 1 2  The figure contains the first 10 5 non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. As more zeros are sampled the more closely their distribution approximates the shape of the GUE random matrix.
