   Particle size      Particle size   Particle size is a notion introduced for comparing dimensions of solid particles ( flecks ), liquid particles ( droplets ), or gaseous particles ( bubbles ).  The notion of particle size applies to   Colloidal particles ;  Particles in ecology;  Particles present in granular material whether airborne or not;  Particles that form a granular material .   The particle size of a spherical object can be unambiguously and quantitatively defined by its diameter . However, a typical material object is likely to be irregular in shape and non-spherical. The above quantitative definition of particle size cannot be applied to non-spherical particles. There are several ways of extending the above quantitative definition to apply to non-spherical particles. Existing definitions are based on replacing a given particle with an imaginary sphere that has one of the properties identical with the particle.   Volume-based particle size equals the diameter of the sphere that has the same volume as a given particle:       D  =   2     3  V    4  π    3        D    2     3       3  V     4  π        D=2\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}   where     D   D   D   : diameter of representative sphere     V   V   V   : volume of particle    Weight-based particle size equals the diameter of the sphere that has the same weight as a given particle.       D  =   2     3  W    4  π  d  g    3        D    2     3       3  W     4  π  d  g        D=2\sqrt[3]{\frac{3W}{4\pi dg}}   where     D   D   D   : diameter of representative sphere     W   W   W   : weight of particle     d   d   d   : density of particle     g   g   g   : gravitational constant    Area-based particle size equals the diameter of the sphere that has the same surface area as a given particle.       D  =   2    A   4  π    2        D    2     2     A    4  π        D=2\sqrt[2]{\frac{A}{4\pi}}   where     D   D   D   : diameter of representative sphere     A   A   A   : surface area of particle    Hydrodynamic or aerodynamic particle size equals the diameter of the sphere that has the same drag coefficient as a given particle.   Another complexity in defining particle size appears for particles with sizes below a micrometre . When a particle becomes that small, the thickness of the interface layer becomes comparable with the particle size. As a result, the position of the particle surface becomes uncertain. There is a convention for placing this imaginary surface at a certain position suggested by Gibbs and presented in many books on interface and colloid science . 1 2 3 4 5 6  Definition of the particle size for an ensemble (collection) of particles presents another problem. Real systems are practically always polydisperse , which means that the particles in an ensemble have different sizes. The notion of particle size distribution reflects this polydispersity. There is often a need for a certain average particle size for the ensemble of particles. There are several different ways of defining such a particle size.   There is an international standard on presenting various characteristic particle sizes. 7 This set of various average sizes includes median size , geometric mean size , average size .   There are several methods for measuring particle size. Some of them are based on light , other on ultrasound , or electric field , or gravity , or centrifugation . They are briefly described in the section particle size distribution .
