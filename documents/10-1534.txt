Nitroalkane oxidase

In enzymology, a nitroalkane oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

a nitroalkane + H2O + O2

 
  an aldehyde or ketone + nitrite + H2O2


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are nitroalkane, H2O, and O2, whereas its 4 products are aldehyde, ketone, nitrite, and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is nitroalkane:oxygen oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include nitroethane oxidase, NAO, and nitroethane:oxygen oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in nitrogen metabolism.
