   Nitroalkane oxidase      Nitroalkane oxidase   In enzymology , a nitroalkane oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a nitroalkane + H 2 O + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   an aldehyde or ketone + nitrite + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are nitroalkane , H 2 O , and O 2 , whereas its 4 products are aldehyde , ketone , nitrite , and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is nitroalkane:oxygen oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include nitroethane oxidase , NAO , and nitroethane:oxygen oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in nitrogen metabolism .  References         "  Category:EC 1.7.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
