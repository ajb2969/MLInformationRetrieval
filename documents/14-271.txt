Autocorrelation matrix

The autocorrelation matrix is used in various digital signal processing algorithms. It consists of elements of the discrete autocorrelation function, 
 
 
 
  arranged in the following manner:


 
  This is clearly a Hermitian matrix and a Toeplitz matrix. If 
 
 
 
  is wide-sense stationary then its autocorrelation matrix will be nonnegative definite.
The autocovariance matrix is related to the autocorrelation matrix as follows:


 
  Where 
 
 
 
  is a vector giving the mean of signal 
 
 
 
  at each index of time.
