Mycinamicin VI 2''-O-methyltransferase

'Mycinamicin VI 2-O-methyltransferase''' (, MycE) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:mycinamicin VI 2-O-methyltransferase''.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + mycinamicin VI $\rightleftharpoons$ S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + mycinamicin III
 

The enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of mycinamicin macrolide antibiotics.
