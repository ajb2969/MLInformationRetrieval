   Carlitz exponential      Carlitz exponential   In mathematics , the Carlitz exponential is a characteristic p analogue to the usual exponential function studied in real and complex analysis . It is used in the definition of the Carlitz module – an example of a Drinfeld module .  Definition  We work over the polynomial ring F q [ T ] of one variable over a finite field  F q with q elements. The completion  C ∞ of an algebraic closure of the field F q (( T −1 )) of formal Laurent series in T −1 will be useful. It is a complete and algebraically closed field.  First we need analogues to the factorials , which appear in the definition of the usual exponential function. For i > 0 we define        [  i  ]   :=    T   q  i    -  T    ,     assign   delimited-[]  i      superscript  T   superscript  q  i    T     [i]:=T^{q^{i}}-T,\,          D  i   :=    ∏   1  ≤  j  ≤  i      [  j  ]    q   i  -  j         assign   subscript  D  i     subscript  product      1  j       i      superscript   delimited-[]  j    superscript  q    i  j        D_{i}:=\prod_{1\leq j\leq i}[j]^{q^{i-j}}     and D 0 := 1. Note that that the usual factorial is inappropriate here, since n ! vanishes in F q [ T ] unless n is smaller than the characteristic of F q [ T ].  Using this we define the Carlitz exponential e C : C ∞ → C ∞ by the convergent sum         e  C    (  x  )    :=    ∑   j  =  0   ∞     x   q  j     D  i      .     assign     subscript  e  C   x     superscript   subscript     j  0         superscript  x   superscript  q  j     subscript  D  i       e_{C}(x):=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{q^{j}}}{D_{i}}.     Relation to the Carlitz module  The Carlitz exponential satisfies the functional equation         e  C    (   T  x   )    =    T   e  C    (  x  )    +    (    e  C    (  x  )    )   q    =    (   T  +  τ   )    e  C    (  x  )     ,           subscript  e  C     T  x        T   subscript  e  C   x    superscript     subscript  e  C   x   q             T  τ    subscript  e  C   x      e_{C}(Tx)=Te_{C}(x)+\left(e_{C}(x)\right)^{q}=(T+\tau)e_{C}(x),\,     where we may view   τ   τ   \tau   as the power of   q   q   q   map or as an element of the ring     F  q    (  T  )    {  τ  }        subscript  F  q   T   τ     F_{q}(T)\{\tau\}   of noncommutative polynomials . By the universal property of polynomial rings in one variable this extends to a ring homomorphism ψ : F q [ T ]→ C ∞ { τ }, defining a Drinfeld F q [ T ]-module over C ∞ { τ }. It is called the Carlitz module.  References      "  Category:Algebraic number theory  Category:Finite fields
