Glycochenodeoxycholate sulfotransferase

In enzymology, a glycochenodeoxycholate sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + glycochenodeoxycholate 
 
 
 
  adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + glycochenodeoxycholate 7-sulfate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and glycochenodeoxycholate, whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and glycochenodeoxycholate 7-sulfate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:glycochenodeoxycholate 7-sulfotransferase. Other names in common use include bile acid:3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate sulfotransferase, bile acid:PAPS:sulfotransferase, and BAST.
