Phase shift module

]
A phase shifter is a microwave network which provides a controllable phase shift of the RF signal.123 Phase shifters are used in phased arrays.456
Classification

Active versus passive: Active phase shifters provide gain, while passive phase shifters are lossy.
 
Active:
 
Applications: active electronically scanned array (AESA), passive electronically scanned array (PESA)
Gain: The phase shifter amplifies while phase shifting
Noise figure (NF)
Reciprocity: not reciprocal

Passive:
 
Applications: active electronically scanned array (AESA), passive electronically scanned array (PESA)
Loss: the phase shifter attenuates while phase shifting
NF: NF = loss
Reciprocity: reciprocal




Analog versus digital:
 
Analog phase shifters provide a continuously variable phase shift or time delay.7
Digital phase shifters provide a discrete set of phase shifts or time delays. Discretization leads to quantization errors. Digital phase shifters require parallel bus control.



Differential, single-ended or waveguide:
 
Differential transmission line: A differential transmission line is a balanced two-conductor transmission line in which the phase difference between currents is 180 degrees. The differential mode is less susceptible to common mode noise and cross talk.
 
Antenna selection: dipole, tapered slot antenna (TSA)
Examples: coplanar strip, slotline

Single-ended transmission line: A single-ended transmission line is a two-conductor transmission line in which one conductor is referenced to a common ground, the second conductor. The single-ended mode is more susceptible to common-mode noise and cross talk.
 
Antenna selection: double folded slot (DFS), microstrip, monopole
Examples: CPW, microstrip, stripline

Waveguide

Antenna selection: waveguide, horn




Frequency band


One-conductor or dielectric transmission line versus two-conductor transmission line

One-conductor or dielectric transmission line (optical fibre, finline, waveguide):
 
Modal
No TEM or quasi-TEM mode, not TTD or quasi-TTD
Higher-order TE, TM, HE or HM modes are distorted

Two-conductor transmission line (CPW, microstrip, slotline, stripline):
 
Differential or single-ended
TEM or quasi-TEM mode is TTD or quasi-TTD




Phase shifters versus TTD phase shifter

A phase shifter provides an invariable phase shift with frequency, and is used for fixed-beam frequency-invariant pattern synthesis.
A TTD phase shifter provides an invariable time delay with frequency, and is used for squint-free and ultra wideband (UWB) beam steering.



Reciprocal versus non-reciprocal

Reciprocal: T/R
Non-reciprocal: T or R



Technology

Non semi-conducting (ferrite, ferro-electric, RF MEMS, liquid crystal):
 
Passive

Semi-conducting (RF CMOS, GaAs. SiGe, InP, GaN or Sb):
 
Active: BJT or FET transistor based MMICs, RFICs or optical ICs
Passive: PIN diode based hybrids




Design

Loaded-line:
 
Distortion:
 
Distorted if lumped
Undistorted and TTD if distributed


Reflect-type:
 
Applications: reflect arrays (S11 phase shifters)
Distortion:
 
Distorted if S21 phase shifter, because of 3Â dB coupler
Undistorted and TTD if S11 phase shifter


Switched-network
 
Network:
 
High-pass or low-pass


 
  or T

Distortion:
 
Undistorted if the left-handed high-pass sections cancel out the distortion of the right-handed low-pass sections


Switched-line
 
Applications: UWB beam steering
Distortion: undistorted and TTD

Vector summing
