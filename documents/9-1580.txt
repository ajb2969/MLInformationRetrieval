2002 (band)

2002 is a new age group composed of Randy and Pamela Copus. 2002 has charted nine albums on the Billboard New Age Charts.1 This Moment Now won the COVR award for Best New Age Album in 2004.2 2002 was named amongst the top new age artists in Billboard's 2003 “Year in Review” issue (December 2003), a list that also featured Yanni, Manheim Steamroller, Jim Brickman, George Winston and Enya.3 They most recently won Vocal Album of the Year from the ZMR Zone Music Awards in 2015.
The themes of several of 2002's albums are deeply rooted in mythology. Wings is based on the Greek legend of Icarus. Savitri and The Emerald Way are both inspired by the ancient Hindu story of Savitri and Satyavan from the Mahabharata. Land of Forever is a ballad of the mystic island of Tír na nÓg, an Irish legend.
Pamela, Randy, and their daughter Sarah record all their music at their state-of-the-art studio. Randy Copus plays piano, electric cello, guitar, bass, and keyboards. Pamela Copus plays flutes, harp, keyboards, and a wind instrument called a WX5. Sarah, their daughter who has recently joined the band, sings and plays celtic harp, piano, and pennywhistle. 2002 provide all of the vocals on their albums, recording their voices many, many times and layering them to create a "virtual choir" with a celestial, angelic quality. The vocals also have many dimensions, as words and chants in Sanskrit, Spanish, Gaelic, Latin and Japanese, representing sacred traditions throughout the world, can be heard on their albums.4
