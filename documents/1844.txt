   Extension by definitions      Extension by definitions   In mathematical logic , more specifically in the proof theory of first-order theories , extensions by definitions formalize the introduction of new symbols by means of a definition. For example, it is common in naive set theory to introduce a symbol   ∅     \emptyset   for the set which has no member. In the formal setting of first-order theories, this can be done by adding to the theory a new constant   ∅     \emptyset   and the new axiom     ∀  x   (  x  ∉  ∅  )      fragments  for-all  x   fragments  normal-(  x    normal-)     \forall x(x\notin\emptyset)   , meaning 'for all x , x is not a member of   ∅     \emptyset   '. It can then be proved that doing so adds essentially nothing to the old theory, as should be expected from a definition. More precisely, the new theory is a conservative extension of the old one.  Definition of relation symbols  Let    T   T   T   be a first-order theory and    ϕ   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )       ϕ    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      \phi(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})   a formula of   T   T   T   such that    x  1     subscript  x  1    x_{1}   , ...,    x  n     subscript  x  n    x_{n}   are distinct and include the variables free in    ϕ   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )       ϕ    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      \phi(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})   . Form a new first-order theory     T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   from   T   T   T   by adding a new   n   n   n   -ary relation symbol   R   R   R   , the logical axioms featuring the symbol   R   R   R   and the new axiom      ∀   x  1   …  ∀   x  n    (  R   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )   ↔  ϕ   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )   )      fragments  for-all   subscript  x  1   normal-…  for-all   subscript  x  n    fragments  normal-(  R   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  1   normal-,  normal-…  normal-,   subscript  x  n   normal-)   normal-↔  ϕ   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  1   normal-,  normal-…  normal-,   subscript  x  n   normal-)   normal-)     \forall x_{1}\dots\forall x_{n}(R(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})\leftrightarrow\phi(x_{1},%
 \dots,x_{n}))   , called the defining axiom of   R   R   R   .  If   ψ   ψ   \psi   is a formula of     T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   , let    ψ  ∗     superscript  ψ  normal-∗    \psi^{\ast}   be the formula of   T   T   T   obtained from   ψ   ψ   \psi   by replacing any occurrence of    R   (   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n   )       R    subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  n      R(t_{1},\dots,t_{n})   by    ϕ   (   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n   )       ϕ    subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  n      \phi(t_{1},\dots,t_{n})   (changing the bound variables in   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   if necessary so that the variables occurring in the    t  i     subscript  t  i    t_{i}   are not bound in    ϕ   (   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n   )       ϕ    subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  n      \phi(t_{1},\dots,t_{n})   ). Then the following hold:       ψ  ↔   ψ  ∗      normal-↔  ψ   superscript  ψ  normal-∗     \psi\leftrightarrow\psi^{\ast}   is provable in     T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   , and       T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   is a conservative extension of   T   T   T   .   The fact that     T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   is a conservative extension of   T   T   T   shows that the defining axiom of   R   R   R   cannot be used to prove new theorems. The formula    ψ  ∗     superscript  ψ  normal-∗    \psi^{\ast}   is called a translation of   ψ   ψ   \psi   into   T   T   T   . Semantically, the formula    ψ  ∗     superscript  ψ  normal-∗    \psi^{\ast}   has the same meaning as   ψ   ψ   \psi   , but the defined symbol   R   R   R   has been eliminated.  Definition of function symbols  Let   T   T   T   be a first-order theory (with equality) and    ϕ   (  y  ,   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )       ϕ   y   subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      \phi(y,x_{1},\dots,x_{n})   a formula of   T   T   T   such that   y   y   y   ,    x  1     subscript  x  1    x_{1}   , ...,    x  n     subscript  x  n    x_{n}   are distinct and include the variables free in    ϕ   (  y  ,   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )       ϕ   y   subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      \phi(y,x_{1},\dots,x_{n})   . Assume that we can prove      ∀    x  1   …   ∀    x  n     ∃  !    y  ϕ   (  y  ,   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )           for-all     subscript  x  1   normal-…   for-all     subscript  x  n          y  ϕ   y   subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n           \forall x_{1}\dots\forall x_{n}\exists!y\phi(y,x_{1},\dots,x_{n})   in   T   T   T   , i.e. for all    x  1     subscript  x  1    x_{1}   , ...,    x  n     subscript  x  n    x_{n}   , there exists a unique y such that    ϕ   (  y  ,   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )       ϕ   y   subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      \phi(y,x_{1},\dots,x_{n})   . Form a new first-order theory     T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   from   T   T   T   by adding a new   n   n   n   -ary function symbol   f   f   f   , the logical axioms featuring the symbol   f   f   f   and the new axiom      ∀    x  1   …   ∀    x  n   ϕ   (   f   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    ,   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )         for-all     subscript  x  1   normal-…   for-all     subscript  x  n   ϕ     f    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n         \forall x_{1}\dots\forall x_{n}\phi(f(x_{1},\dots,x_{n}),x_{1},\dots,x_{n})   , called the defining axiom of   f   f   f   .  If   ψ   ψ   \psi   is an atomic formula of     T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   , define a formula    ψ  ∗     superscript  ψ  normal-∗    \psi^{\ast}   of   T   T   T   recursively as follows. If the new symbol   f   f   f   does not occur in   ψ   ψ   \psi   , let    ψ  ∗     superscript  ψ  normal-∗    \psi^{\ast}   be   ψ   ψ   \psi   . Otherwise, choose an occurrence of    f   (   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n   )       f    subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  n      f(t_{1},\dots,t_{n})   in   ψ   ψ   \psi   such that   f   f   f   does not occur in the terms    t  i     subscript  t  i    t_{i}   , and let   χ   χ   \chi   be obtained from   ψ   ψ   \psi   by replacing that occurrence by a new variable   z   z   z   . Then since   f   f   f   occurs in   χ   χ   \chi   one less time than in   ψ   ψ   \psi   , the formula    χ  ∗     superscript  χ  normal-∗    \chi^{\ast}   has already been defined, and we let    ψ  ∗     superscript  ψ  normal-∗    \psi^{\ast}   be      ∀  z   (  ϕ   (  z  ,   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n   )   →   χ  ∗   )      fragments  for-all  z   fragments  normal-(  ϕ   fragments  normal-(  z  normal-,   subscript  t  1   normal-,  normal-…  normal-,   subscript  t  n   normal-)   normal-→   superscript  χ  normal-∗   normal-)     \forall z(\phi(z,t_{1},\dots,t_{n})\rightarrow\chi^{\ast})   (changing the bound variables in   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   if necessary so that the variables occurring in the    t  i     subscript  t  i    t_{i}   are not bound in    ϕ   (  z  ,   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n   )       ϕ   z   subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  n      \phi(z,t_{1},\dots,t_{n})   ). For a general formula   ψ   ψ   \psi   , the formula    ψ  ∗     superscript  ψ  normal-∗    \psi^{\ast}   is formed by replacing every occurrence of an atomic subformula   χ   χ   \chi   by    χ  ∗     superscript  χ  normal-∗    \chi^{\ast}   . Then the following hold:       ψ  ↔   ψ  ∗      normal-↔  ψ   superscript  ψ  normal-∗     \psi\leftrightarrow\psi^{\ast}   is provable in     T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   , and       T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   is a conservative extension of   T   T   T   .   The formula    ψ  ∗     superscript  ψ  normal-∗    \psi^{\ast}   is called a translation of   ψ   ψ   \psi   into   T   T   T   . As in the case of relation symbols, the formula    ψ  ∗     superscript  ψ  normal-∗    \psi^{\ast}   has the same meaning as   ψ   ψ   \psi   , but the new symbol   f   f   f   has been eliminated.  The construction of this paragraph also works for constants, which can be viewed as 0-ary function symbols.  Extensions by definitions  A first-order theory     T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   obtained from   T   T   T   by successive introductions of relation symbols and function symbols as above is called an extension by definitions of   T   T   T   . Then     T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   is a conservative extension of   T   T   T   , and for any formula   ψ   ψ   \psi   of     T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   we can form a formula    ψ  ∗     superscript  ψ  normal-∗    \psi^{\ast}   of   T   T   T   , called a translation of   ψ   ψ   \psi   into   T   T   T   , such that    ψ  ↔   ψ  ∗      normal-↔  ψ   superscript  ψ  normal-∗     \psi\leftrightarrow\psi^{\ast}   is provable in     T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   . Such a formula is not unique, but any two of them can be proved to be equivalent in T .  In practice, an extension by definitions     T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   of T is not distinguished from the original theory T . In fact, the formulas of     T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   can be thought of as abbreviating their translations into T . The manipulation of these abbreviations as actual formulas is then justified by the fact that extensions by definitions are conservative.  Examples   Traditionally, the first-order set theory ZF has   =     =   (equality) and   ∈     \in   (membership) as its only primitive relation symbols, and no function symbols. In everyday mathematics, however, many other symbols are used such as the binary relation symbol   ⊆     \subseteq   , the constant   ∅     \emptyset   , the unary function symbol P (the power-set operation), etc. All of these symbols belong in fact to extensions by definitions of ZF.    Let   T   T   T   be a first-order theory for groups in which the only primitive symbol is the binary product   ⋅   normal-⋅   \cdot   . In T , we can prove that there exists a unique element y such that x.y = y.x = x for every x . Therefore we can add to T a new constant e and the axiom       ∀  x   (  x  ⋅  e  =  x  and  e  ⋅  x  =  x  )      fragments  for-all  x   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-⋅  e   x  and  e  normal-⋅  x   x  normal-)     \forall x(x\cdot e=x\text{ and }e\cdot x=x)   , and what we obtain is an extension by definitions     T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   of T . Then in     T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   we can prove that for every x , there exists a unique y such that x.y = y.x = e . Consequently, the first-order theory     T  ′′      superscript  T  ′′    T^{\prime\prime}\,   obtained from     T  ′      superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}\,   by adding a unary function symbol   f   f   f   and the axiom      ∀  x   (  x  ⋅  f   (  x  )   =  e  and  f   (  x  )   ⋅  x  =  e  )      fragments  for-all  x   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-⋅  f   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    e  and  f   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-⋅  x   e  normal-)     \forall x(x\cdot f(x)=e\text{ and }f(x)\cdot x=e)   is an extension by definitions of T . Usually,    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   is denoted    x   -  1      superscript  x    1     x^{-1}   .  Bibliography   S.C. Kleene (1952), Introduction to Metamathematics , D. Van Nostrand  E.
