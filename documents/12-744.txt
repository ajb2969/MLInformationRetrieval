Continuous game

A continuous game is a mathematical generalization, used in game theory. It extends the notion of a discrete game, where the players choose from a finite set of pure strategies. The continuous game concepts allows games to include more general sets of pure strategies, which may be uncountably infinite.
In general, a game with uncountably infinite strategy sets will not necessarily have a Nash equilibrium solution. If, however, the strategy sets are required to be compact and the utility functions continuous, then a Nash equilibrium will be guaranteed; this is by Glicksberg's generalization of the Kakutani fixed point theorem. The class of continuous games is for this reason usually defined and studied as a subset of the larger class of infinite games (i.e. games with infinite strategy sets) in which the strategy sets are compact and the utility functions continuous.
Formal definition
Define the n-player continuous game 
 
 
 
  where




 
  is the set of 
 
 
 
  players,
 


 
  where each 
 
 
 
  is a compact metric space corresponding to the 
 
 
th player's set of pure strategies,
 


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the utility function of player 
 
 



We define 
 
 
 
  to be the set of Borel probability measures on 
 
 
 
 , giving us the mixed strategy space of player i.
 
Define the strategy profile 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 


Let 
 
 
 
  be a strategy profile of all players except for player 
 
 
 
 . As with discrete games, we can define a best response correspondence for player 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is a relation from the set of all probability distributions over opponent player profiles to a set of player 
 
 
 
 's strategies, such that each element of


 
  is a best response to 
 
 
 
 . Define


 
 . A strategy profile 
 
 
 
  is a Nash equilibrium if and only if 
 
 
 
  The existence of a Nash equilibrium for any continuous game with continuous utility functions can been proven using Irving Glicksberg's generalization of the Kakutani fixed point theorem.1 In general, there may not be a solution if we allow strategy spaces, 
 
 
 
 's which are not compact, or if we allow non-continuous utility functions.
Separable games
A separable game is a continuous game where, for any i, the utility function 
 
 
 
  can be expressed in the sum-of-products form:


 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and the functions 
 
 
 
  are continuous. A polynomial game is a separable game where each 
 
 
 
  is a compact interval on 
 
 
 
  and each utility function can be written as a multivariate polynomial.
In general, mixed Nash equilibria of separable games are easier to compute than non-separable games as implied by the following theorem:

For any separable game there exists at least one Nash equilibrium where player i mixes at most 
 
 
 
  pure strategies.2


Whereas an equilibrium strategy for a non-separable game may require an uncountably infinite support, a separable game is guaranteed to have at least one Nash equilibrium with finitely supported mixed strategies.
Examples
Separable games
A polynomial game
Consider a zero-sum 2-player game between players X and Y, with 
 
 
 
 . Denote elements of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively. Define the utility functions 
 
 
 
  where


 
 .
The pure strategy best response relations are:






 
  and 
 
 
 
  do not intersect, so there is
no pure strategy Nash equilibrium. However, there should be a mixed strategy equilibrium. To find it, express the expected value, 
 
 
 
  as a linear combination of the first and second moments of the probability distributions of X and Y:



(where 
 
 
 
 
  and similarly for Y).
The constraints on 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (with similar constraints for y,) are given by Hausdorff as:



Each pair of constraints defines a compact convex subset in the plane. Since 
 
 
 
  is linear, any extrema with respect to a player's first two moments will lie on the boundary of this subset. Player i's equilibrium strategy will lie on



Note that the first equation only permits mixtures of 0 and 1 whereas the second equation only permits pure strategies. Moreover, if the best response at a certain point to player i lies on 
 
 
 
 , it will lie on the whole line, so that both 0 and 1 are a best response. 
 
 
 
  simply gives the pure strategy 
 
 
 
 , so 
 
 
 
  will never give both 0 and 1. However 
 
 
 
  gives both 0 and 1 when y = 1/2. A Nash equilibrium exists when:



This determines one unique equilibrium where Player X plays a random mixture of 0 for 1/2 of the time and 1 the other 1/2 of the time. Player Y plays the pure strategy of 1/2. The value of the game is 1/4.
Non-Separable Games
A rational pay-off function
Consider a zero-sum 2-player game between players X and Y, with 
 
 
 
 . Denote elements of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively. Define the utility functions 
 
 
 
  where



This game has no pure strategy Nash equilibrium. It can be shown3 that a unique mixed strategy Nash equilibrium exists with the following pair of probability density functions:



The value of the game is 
 
 
 
 .
Requiring a Cantor distribution
Consider a zero-sum 2-player game between players X and Y, with 
 
 
 
 . Denote elements of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively. Define the utility functions 
 
 
 
  where


 
 . This game has a unique mixed strategy equilibrium where each player plays a mixed strategy with the cantor singular function as the cumulative distribution function.4
