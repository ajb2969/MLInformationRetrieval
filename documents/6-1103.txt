   Magnetic inductance      Magnetic inductance    Magnetic inductance is not to be confused with "Magnetic induction", which usually refers to Magnetic field .    In a magnetic circuit , magnetic inductance (inductive magnetic reactance) is the analogy to inductance in an electrical circuit. Magnetic inductance is a concept in the gyrator-capacitor model for magnetic systems.In the SI system, it is measured in units of - Ω −1 . This model makes magnetomotive force (mmf) the analog of electromotive force in electrical circuits, and time rate of change of magnetic flux the analog of electric current. The gyrator-capacitor model is a lumped-element model for analysis of magnetic fields.  For phasor analysis the magnetic inductive reactance is:       x  L   =   ω   L  M         subscript  x  L     ω   subscript  L  M      x_{L}=\omega L_{M}     Where:      L  M     subscript  L  M    L_{M}   is the magnetic inductivity ( SI Unit : -s· Ω −1 )     ω   ω   \omega   is the angular frequency of the magnetic circuit  In the complex form it is a positive imaginary number:       j   x  L    =   j  ω   L  M          j   subscript  x  L      j  ω   subscript  L  M      jx_{L}=j\omega L_{M}     The magnetic potential energy sustained by magnetic inductivity varies with the frequency of oscillations in electric fields. The average power in a given period is equal to zero. Due to its dependence on frequency, magnetic inductance is mainly observable in magnetic circuits which operate at VHF and/or UHF frequencies.  The notion of magnetic inductivity is employed in analysis and computation of circuit behavior in the gyrator-capacitor model in a way analogous to inductance in electrical circuits.
