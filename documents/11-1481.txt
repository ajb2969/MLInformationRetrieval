   Ethanolamine kinase      Ethanolamine kinase   In enzymology , an ethanolamine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + ethanolamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + O-phosphoethanolamine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and ethanolamine , whereas its two products are ADP and O-phosphoethanolamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:ethanolamine O-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include ethanolamine kinase (phosphorylating) , and ethanolamine phosphokinase . This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism .  References       "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
