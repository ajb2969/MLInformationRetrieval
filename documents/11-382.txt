Polar-amino-acid-transporting ATPase




Polar-amino-acid-transporting ATPase

In enzymology, a polar-amino-acid-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + H2O + polar amino acidout 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + polar amino acidin
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, H2O, and polar amino acid, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and polar amino acid.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (polar-amino-acid-importing). This enzyme is also called histidine permease. This enzyme participates in abc transporters - general.
