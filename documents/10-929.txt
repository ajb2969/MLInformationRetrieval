Fumarate reductase (NADH)




Fumarate reductase (NADH)

In enzymology, a fumarate reductase (NADH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

succinate + NAD+

 
  fumarate + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are succinate and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are fumarate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is succinate:NAD+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include NADH-fumarate reductase, NADH-dependent fumarate reductase, and fumarate reductase (NADH).
