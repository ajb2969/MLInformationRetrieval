   Naimark's problem      Naimark's problem   Naimark 's Problem is a question in functional analysis . It asks whether every C*-algebra that has only one irreducible   *     *   -representation up to unitary equivalence is isomorphic to the   *     *   -algebra of compact operators on some (not necessarily separable) Hilbert space .  The problem has been solved in the affirmative for special cases (specifically for separable and Type-I C*-algebras).  used the    ♢   normal-♢   \diamondsuit   -Principle to construct a C*-algebra with    ℵ  1     subscript  normal-ℵ  1    \aleph_{1}   generators that serves as a counterexample to Naimark's Problem. More precisely, they showed that the statement " There exists a counterexample to Naimark's Problem that is generated by     ℵ  1     subscript  normal-ℵ  1    \aleph_{1}    elements " is independent of the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory and the Axiom of Choice (   𝖹𝖥𝖢   𝖹𝖥𝖢   \mathsf{ZFC}   ).  Whether Naimark's problem itself is independent of   𝖹𝖥𝖢   𝖹𝖥𝖢   \mathsf{ZFC}   remains unknown.
