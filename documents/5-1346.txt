Naimark's problem

Naimark's Problem is a question in functional analysis. It asks whether every C*-algebra that has only one irreducible 
 
 
 
 -representation up to unitary equivalence is isomorphic to the 
 
 
 
 -algebra of compact operators on some (not necessarily separable) Hilbert space.
The problem has been solved in the affirmative for special cases (specifically for separable and Type-I C*-algebras).  used the 

 
 -Principle to construct a C*-algebra with 
 
 
 
  generators that serves as a counterexample to Naimark's Problem. More precisely, they showed that the statement "There exists a counterexample to Naimark's Problem that is generated by 

 elements" is independent of the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory and the Axiom of Choice (
 
 
 
 ).
Whether Naimark's problem itself is independent of 
 
 
 
  remains unknown.
