4-hydroxymuconic-semialdehyde dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a 4-hydroxymuconic-semialdehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde + NAD+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  maleylacetate + NADH + 2 H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 4-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde, NAD+, and H2O, whereas its 3 products are maleylacetate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxymuconic-semialdehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation.
