Draft:Template:calculate/dz＝d0÷(1+z)/doc




Purpose
Convert contemporary proper distance, d0, the comoving distance, into the proper distance at redshift "z"

This converts the current separation between us and a distant object, to the separation between us and the distant object at the time indicated by the value of "z" (such as the time of emission, so "z" being the redshift of the distant object)
 

Usage


(MANDATORY) value of redshift

(MANDATORY) comoving distance

NOTE: the units that d0 is expressed in provide the output units
