   Hypotrochoid      Hypotrochoid   A hypotrochoid is a roulette traced by a point attached to a circle of radius  r rolling around the inside of a fixed circle of radius R , where the point is a distance  d from the center of the interior circle.  The parametric equations for a hypotrochoid are: 1       x   (  θ  )    =     (   R  -  r   )    cos  θ    +   d   cos   (     R  -  r   r   θ   )            x  θ         R  r     θ      d          R  r   r   θ        x(\theta)=(R-r)\cos\theta+d\cos\left({R-r\over r}\theta\right)           y   (  θ  )    =     (   R  -  r   )    sin  θ    -   d   sin   (     R  -  r   r   θ   )       .        y  θ         R  r     θ      d          R  r   r   θ        y(\theta)=(R-r)\sin\theta-d\sin\left({R-r\over r}\theta\right).     Where   θ   θ   \theta   is the angle formed by the horizontal and the center of the rolling circle (note that these are not polar equations because   θ   θ   \theta   is not the polar angle).  Special cases include the hypocycloid with d = r and the ellipse with R = 2 r .  (Figure)  400|thumb|The ellipse (drawn in red) may be expressed as a special case of the hypotrochoid, with R = 2r; here R = 10, r = 5, d = 1.   The classic Spirograph toy traces out hypotrochoid and epitrochoid curves.
