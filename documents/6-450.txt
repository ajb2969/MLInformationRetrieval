   Shear strength      Shear strength   In engineering , shear strength is the strength of a material or component against the type of yield or structural failure where the material or component fails in shear . A shear load is a force that tends to produce a sliding failure on a material along a plane that is parallel to the direction of the force. When a paper is cut with scissors, the paper fails in shear.  In structural and mechanical engineering the shear strength of a component is important for designing the dimensions and materials to be used for the manufacture/construction of the component (e.g. beams , plates , or bolts ) In a reinforced concrete beam, the main purpose of reinforcing bar (rebar) stirrups is to increase the shear strength.  For shear stress    τ   τ   \tau   applies       τ  =     σ  1   -   σ  3    2    ,      τ       subscript  σ  1    subscript  σ  3    2     \tau=\frac{\sigma_{1}-\sigma_{3}}{2},     where      σ  1     subscript  σ  1    \sigma_{1}   is major principal stress      σ  3     subscript  σ  3    \sigma_{3}   is minor principal stress  In general: ductile materials (e.g. aluminium) fail in shear, whereas brittle materials (e.g. cast iron) fail in tension. See tensile strength .  To calculate:  Given total force at failure (F) and the force-resisting area (e.g. the cross-section of a bolt loaded in shear), Ultimate Shear Strength (   τ   τ   \tau   ) is:      τ  =   F  A   =   F   π   r   b  o  l  t   2     =    4  F    π   d   b  o  l  t   2           τ    F  A          F    π   superscript   subscript  r    b  o  l  t    2              4  F     π   superscript   subscript  d    b  o  l  t    2        \tau=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{F}{\pi r_{bolt}^{2}}=\frac{4F}{\pi d_{bolt}^{2}}     Comparison  As a very rough guide relating tensile, yield, and shear strengths: 1      Material   Ultimate Strength Relationship   Yield Strength Relationship       Steels   USS = approx. 0.75*UTS   SYS = approx. 0.58*TYS     Ductile Iron   USS = approx. 0.9*UTS   SYS = approx. 0.75*TYS     Malleable Iron   USS = approx. 1.0*UTS      Wrought Iron   USS = approx. 0.83*UTS      Cast Iron   USS = approx. 1.3*UTS      Aluminiums   USS = approx. 0.65*UTS   SYS = approx. 0.55*TYS     USS: Ultimate Shear Strength, UTS: Ultimate Tensile Strength, SYS: Shear Yield Stress, TYS: Tensile Yield Stress      Material   Ultimate stress ( Ksi )   Ultimate stress ( MPa )       Fiberglass/epoxy (23 o C) {{cite techreport   url= http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a117902.pdf   first=DC     When values measured from physical samples are desired, a number of testing standards are available, covering different material categories and testing conditions. In the US, ASTM standards for measuring shear strength include ASTM B831, D732, D4255, D5379, and D7078. Internationally, ISO testing standards for shear strength include ISO 3597, 12579, and 14130. 2  See also   Shear modulus  Shear stress  Shear strain  Shear strength (soil)  Shear strength (Discontinuity)  Strength of materials  Tensile strength   References    "  Category:Mechanical engineering  Category:Structural engineering     http://www.roymech.co.uk/Useful_Tables/Matter/shear_tensile.htm ↩  S.
