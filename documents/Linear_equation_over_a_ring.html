<h1>Linear equation over a ring</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a class="uri" href="algebra" title="wikilink">algebra</a>, <strong><a href="linear_equation" title="wikilink">linear equations</a></strong> and <strong><a href="systems_of_linear_equations" title="wikilink">systems of linear equations</a></strong> over a <a href="field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">field</a> are widely studied. "Over a field" means that the <a href="coefficient" title="wikilink">coefficients</a> of the equations and the solutions that one is looking for belong to a given field, commonly the <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real</a> or the <a href="complex_number" title="wikilink">complex numbers</a>. This article is devoted to the same problems where "field" is replaced by "<a href="commutative_ring" title="wikilink">commutative ring</a>", or, typically "<a href="Noetherian_ring" title="wikilink">Noetherian</a> <a href="integral_domain" title="wikilink">integral domain</a>".</p>
<p>In the case of a single equation, the problem splits in two parts. First, the <strong>ideal membership problem</strong>, which consists, given a non homogeneous equation</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$a_1x_1 + \cdots + a_kx_k=b$$</span> with <span class="LaTeX">$a_1, \ldots, a_k$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$b$</span> in a given ring <span class="LaTeX">$R$</span>, to decide if it has a solution with <span class="LaTeX">$x_1, \ldots, x_k$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$R$</span>, and, if any, to provide one. This amounts to decide if <span class="LaTeX">$b$</span> belongs to the ideal generated by the <mtpl></mtpl>. The simplest instance of this problem is, for <em>k</em> = 1 and <span class="LaTeX">$ b = 1$</span>, to decide if <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> is a unit in <span class="LaTeX">$R$</span>.</p>
<p>The <strong>syzygy problem</strong> consists, given <em>k</em> elements <span class="LaTeX">$a_1, \ldots, a_k$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$R$</span>, to provide a system of generators of the <a href="module_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">module</a> of the <a href="Syzygy_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">syzygies</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$(a_1, \ldots, a_k),$</span> that is a system of generators of the <a class="uri" href="submodule" title="wikilink">submodule</a> of those elements <span class="LaTeX">$(x_1, \ldots, x_k)$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$R$</span><sup><em>k</em></sup> that are solution of the homogeneous equation</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$a_1x_1 + \cdots + a_kx_k=0.$$</span> The simplest case, when <em>k</em> = 1 amounts to find a system of generators of the <a href="Annihilator_(ring_theory)" title="wikilink">annihilator</a> of <mtpl></mtpl>.</p>
<p>Given a solution of the ideal membership problem, one obtains all the solutions by adding to it the elements of the module of syzygies. In other words, all the solutions are provided by the solution of these two partial problems.</p>
<p>In the case of several equations, the same decomposition into subproblems occurs. The first problem becomes the <strong>submodule membership problem</strong>. The second one is also called the <strong>syzygy problem</strong>.</p>
<p>A ring such that there are algorithms for the arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) and for the above problems may be called a <strong>computable ring</strong>, or <strong>effective ring</strong>. One may also say that linear algebra on the ring is <strong>effective</strong>.</p>
<p>The article considers the main rings for which linear algebra is effective.</p>
<h2 id="generalities">Generalities</h2>
<p>To be able of solving the syzygy problem, it is necessary that the module of syzygies is finitely generated, because it is impossible to output an infinite list. Therefore the problems considered here make sense only for <a href="Noetherian_ring" title="wikilink">Noetherian rings</a>, or at least a <a href="coherent_ring" title="wikilink">coherent ring</a>. In fact, this article is restricted to Noetherian <a href="integral_domain" title="wikilink">integral domains</a> because of the following result.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Given a Noetherian integral domain, if there is are <a href="algorithm" title="wikilink">algorithms</a> to solve the ideal membership problem and the syzygies problem for a single equation, then one may deduce from them algorithms for the similar problems concerning systems of equations.</em></p>
<p>This theorem is useful to prove the existence of algorithms. However, in practice, the algorithms for the systems are designed directly, as it is done for the systems of linear equations over a field.</p>
<h3 id="properties-of-effective-rings">Properties of effective rings</h3>
<p>Let <em>R</em> be an effective commutative ring.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is an algorithm for testing if an element <em>a</em> is a <a href="zero_divisor" title="wikilink">zero divisor</a>: this amounts to solve the linear equation <span class="LaTeX">$ ax = 0$</span>.</li>
<li>There is an algorithm for testing if an element <em>a</em> is a <a href="unit_(ring_theory)" title="wikilink">unit</a>, and if it is, computing its inverse: this amounts to solve the linear equation <span class="LaTeX">$ ax = 1$</span>.</li>
<li>Given an ideal <em>I</em> generated by <mtpl></mtpl>, there is an algorithm for testing if two elements of <em>R</em> have the same image in <em>R</em>/<em>I</em>, and linear algebra is effective over <em>R</em>/<em>I</em>: testing the equality of the images of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> amounts to solve the equation <mtpl></mtpl>; for solving a linear system over <em>R</em>/<em>I</em>, it suffices to write it over <em>R</em> and to add to one side of the <em>i</em>th equation <mtpl></mtpl> (for <em>i</em> = 1, ...), where the <mtpl></mtpl> are new unknowns.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="linear-equations-over-the-integers-or-a-principal-ideal-domain">Linear equations over the integers or a principal ideal domain</h2>
<p>There are algorithms to solve all the problems addressed in this article over the integers. In other words, <em>linear algebra is effective over the integers</em>. See <a href="Linear_Diophantine_system" title="wikilink">Linear Diophantine system</a> for details.</p>
<p>The same solution applies to the same problems over a <a href="principal_ideal_domain" title="wikilink">principal ideal domain</a>, with the following modifications.</p>
<p>The notion of <a href="unimodular_matrix" title="wikilink">unimodular matrix</a> of integers must be extended by calling <em>unimodular</em> a matrix over a <a href="integral_domain" title="wikilink">integral domain</a> whose <a class="uri" href="determinant" title="wikilink">determinant</a> is a <a href="unit_(ring_theory)" title="wikilink">unit</a>. This means that the determinant is <a class="uri" href="invertible" title="wikilink">invertible</a> and implies that unimodular matrices are the <a href="invertible_matrices" title="wikilink">invertible matrices</a> such all entries of the <a href="inverse_matrix" title="wikilink">inverse matrix</a> belong to the domain.</p>
<p>To have an algorithmic solution of linear systems, a solution for a single linear equation in two unknowns is clearly required. In the case of the integers, such a solution is provided by <a href="extended_Euclidean_algorithm" title="wikilink">extended Euclidean algorithm</a>. Thus one needs that, for the considered principal ideal domain, there is an algorithm with a similar specification as the extended Euclidean algorithm. That is, given <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> in the principal ideal domain, there is an algorithm computing a unimodular matrix</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\begin{bmatrix}  s&t;\\u&v; \end{bmatrix}$$</span> such that</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\begin{bmatrix}  s&t;\\u&v; \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}  a\\b \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}\gcd(a,b)\\0 \end{bmatrix}.$$</span></p>
<p>Having such an algorithm, the <a href="Smith_normal_form" title="wikilink">Smith normal form</a> of a matrix may be computed exactly as in the integer case, and this suffices to apply the method of <a href="Linear_Diophantine_system" title="wikilink">Linear Diophantine system</a>.</p>
<p>The main case where this is commonly used is the case of linear systems over the ring of <a href="univariate_polynomial" title="wikilink">univariate polynomials</a> over a field. In this case, the extended Euclidean algorithm may be used. See <a href="polynomial_greatest_common_divisor#Bézout's_identity_and_extended_GCD_algorithm" title="wikilink">polynomial greatest common divisor#Bézout's identity and extended GCD algorithm</a> for details.</p>
