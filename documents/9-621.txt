   Compressibility equation      Compressibility equation   In statistical mechanics and thermodynamics the compressibility equation refers to an equation which relates the isothermal compressibility (and indirectly the pressure) to the structure of the liquid. It reads:        k  T   (    ∂  ρ    ∂  p    )    =   1  +   ρ    ∫  V    d  𝐫   [    g   (  r  )    -  1   ]             k  T      ρ     p       1    ρ    subscript   V     normal-d  𝐫   delimited-[]      g  r   1          kT\left(\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial p}\right)=1+\rho\int_{V}\mathrm{d}\mathbf%
 {r}[g(r)-1]   (1)   where   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the number density, g(r) is the radial distribution function and    k  T   (    ∂  ρ    ∂  p    )       k  T      ρ     p      kT\left(\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial p}\right)   is the isothermal compressibility .  Using the Fourier representation of the Ornstein-Zernike equation the compressibility equation (1) can be rewritten in the form:         1   k  T     (    ∂  p    ∂  ρ    )    =   1   1  +   ρ    ∫   h   (  r  )   d  𝐫        =   1   1  +   ρ   H  ^    (  0  )      =   1  -   ρ   C  ^    (  0  )     =   1  -   ρ   ∫   c   (  r  )   d  𝐫                1    k  T        p     ρ       1    1    ρ      h  r  normal-d  𝐫              1    1    ρ   normal-^  H   0            1    ρ   normal-^  C   0           1    ρ      c  r  normal-d  𝐫         \frac{1}{kT}\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial\rho}\right)=\frac{1}{1+\rho\int h%
