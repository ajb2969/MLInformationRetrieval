Retract (group theory)

In mathematics, in the field of group theory, a subgroup of a group is termed a retract if there is an endomorphism of the group that maps surjectively to the subgroup and is identity on the subgroup. In symbols, 
 
 
 
  is a retract of 
 
 
 
  if and only if there is an endomorphism 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .12
The endomorphism itself (having this property) is an idempotent element in the transformation monoid of endomophisms, so it called an idempotent endomorphism34 or a retraction.5
The following is known about retracts:

A subgroup is a retract if and only if it has a normal complement.6 The normal complement, specifically, is the kernel of the retraction.
Every direct factor is a retract.7 Conversely, any retract which is a normal subgroup is a direct factor.8
Every retract has the congruence extension property.
Every regular factor, and in particular, every free factor, is a retract.
