Shc the shell script compiler

SHC is a shell script compiler written in C programming language. The Shell Script Compiler (SHC) convertslinux shell scripts directly into executable binaries. Compiling shell scripts into binaries provides protection against accidental changes, source modification and renders a way of hinding source code written in linux shell scripting language.1
Mechanism
SHC takes a shell script which is specified on the command line by $[-f filename]$ option and produces a C source code of the script. The generated source code is then compiled and linked to produce a binary executable. Thus it's a two step process where, at first step, it creates a $filename.x.c$ file of the shell script file $filename$. Then it is compiled with $cc -$CFLAGS filename.x.c$ and thus build the binary from a C source code with the default C compiler available in any system.2
