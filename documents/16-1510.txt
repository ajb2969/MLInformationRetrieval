Kirkwood–Buff solution theory
The Kirkwood–Buff (KB) solution theory, due to John G. Kirkwood and Frank P. Buff, links macroscopic (bulk) properties to microscopic (molecular) details. Using statistical mechanics, the KB theory derives thermodynamic quantities from pair correlation functions between all molecules in a multi-component solution.1 The KB theory proves to be a valuable tool for validation of molecular simulations, as well as for the molecular-resolution elucidation of the mechanisms underlying various physical processes.234 For example, it has numerous applications in biologically relevant systems.5
The reverse process is also possible; the so-called reverse Kirkwood–Buff (reverse-KB) theory, due to Arieh Ben-Naim, derives molecular details from thermodynamic (bulk) measurements. This advancement allows the use of the KB formalism to formulate predictions regarding microscopic properties on the basis of macroscopic information.67
The radial distribution function
The radial distribution function (RDF), also termed the pair distribution function or the pair correlation function, is a measure of local structuring in a mixture. The RDF between components 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  positioned at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively, is defined as:



where 
 
 
 
  is the local density of component 
 
 
 
  relative to component 
 
 
 
 , the quantity 
 
 
 
  is the density of component 
 
 
 
  in the bulk, and 
 
 
 
  is the inter-particle radius vector. Necessarily, it also follows that:



Assuming spherical symmetry, the RDF reduces to:



where 
 
 
 
  is the inter-particle distance.
In certain cases, it is useful to quantify the intermolecular correlations in terms terms of free energy. Specifically, the RDF is related to the potential of mean force (PMF) between the two components by:



where the PMF is essentially a measure of the effective interactions between the two components in the solution.
The Kirkwood–Buff integrals
The Kirkwood–Buff integral (KBI) between components 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is defined as the spatial integral over the pair correlation function:



which in the case of spherical symmetry reduces to:



Derivation of thermodynamic quantities
Two-component system
It is possible to derive various thermodynamic relations for a two-component mixture in terms of the relevant KBI (
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 ).
The partial molar volume of component 1 is:



where 
 
 
 
  is the and naturally 
 
 

The compressibility, 
 
 
 
 , satisfies:



where 
 
 
 
  is the Boltzmann constant and 
 
 
 
  is the temperature.
The derivative of the osmotic pressure, 
 
 
 
 , with respect to the concentration of component 2:



where 
 
 
 
  is the chemical potential of component 1.
The derivatives of chemical potentials with respect to concentrations, at constant temperature (
 
 
 
 ) and pressure (
 
 
 
 ) are:






or alternatively, with respect to mole fraction:



The preferential interaction coefficient
The relative preference of a molecular species to solvate (interact) with another molecular species is quantified using the preferential interaction coefficient, 
 
 
 
 .8 Lets consider a solution that consists of the solvent (water), solute, and cosolute. The relative (effective) interaction of water with the solute is related to the preferential hydration coefficient, 
 
 
 
 , which is positive if the solute is "preferentially hydrated". In the Kirkwood-Buff theory frame-work, and in the low concentration regime of cosolutes, the preferential hydration coefficent is:



where 
 
 
 
  is the molarity of water, and W, S, and C correspond to water, solute, and cosolute, respectively.
In the most general case, the preferential hydration is a function of the KBI of solute with both solvent and cosolute. However, under very simple assumptions9 and in many practical examples,10 it reduces to:



So the only function of relevance is
