   N-acylneuraminate-9-phosphate synthase      N-acylneuraminate-9-phosphate synthase   In enzymology , a N-acylneuraminate-9-phosphate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   phosphoenolpyruvate + N-acyl-D-mannosamine 6-phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-acylneuraminate 9-phosphate + phosphate   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are phosphoenolpyruvate , N-acyl-D-mannosamine 6-phosphate , and H 2 O , whereas its two products are N-acylneuraminate 9-phosphate and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphoenolpyruvate:N-acyl-D-mannosamine-6-phosphate 1-(2-carboxy-2-oxoethyl)transferase . Other names in common use include N-acetylneuraminate 9-phosphate lyase , N-acetylneuraminate 9-phosphate sialic acid 9-phosphate synthase , N-acetylneuraminate 9-phosphate synthetase , N-acylneuraminate-9-phosphate pyruvate-lyase , (pyruvate-phosphorylating) , and sialic acid 9-phosphate synthetase . This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
