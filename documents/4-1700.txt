   Hall–Janko graph      Hall–Janko graph   In the mathematical field of graph theory , the Hall–Janko graph , also known as the Hall-Janko-Wales graph , is a 36- regular  undirected graph with 100 vertices and 1800 edges. 1  It is a rank 3  strongly regular graph with parameters (100,36,14,12) and a maximum coclique of size 10. This parameter set is not unique, it is however uniquely determined by its parameters as a rank 3 graph. The Hall–Janko graph was originally constructed by D. Wales to establish the existence of the Hall-Janko group as an index 2 subgroup of its automorphism group .  The Hall–Janko graph can be constructed out of objects in U 3 (3), the simple group of order 6048: 2 3   In U 3 (3) there are 36 simple maximal subgroups of order 168. These are the vertices of a subgraph, the U 3 (3) graph. A 168-subgroup has 14 maximal subgroups of order 24, isomorphic to S 4 . Two 168-subgroups are called adjacent when they intersect in a 24-subgroup. The U 3 (3) graph is strongly regular, with parameters (36,14,4,6)  There are 63 involutions (elements of order 2). A 168-subgroup contains 21 involutions, which are defined to be neighbors.  Outside U 3 (3) let there be a 100th vertex C , whose neighbors are the 36 168-subgroups. A 168-subgroup then has 14 common neighbors with C and in all 1+14+21 neighbors.  An involution is found in 12 of the 168-subgroups. C and an involution are non-adjacent, with 12 common neighbors.  Two involutions are defined as adjacent when they generate a dihedral subgroup of order 8. 4 An involution has 24 involutions as neighbors.   The characteristic polynomial of the Hall–Janko graph is     (   x  -  36   )     (   x  -  6   )   36     (   x  +  4   )   63         x  36    superscript    x  6   36    superscript    x  4   63     (x-36)(x-6)^{36}(x+4)^{63}   . Therefore the Hall–Janko graph is an integral graph : its spectrum consists entirely of integers.
