   Trans-2-decenoyl-(acyl-carrier protein) isomerase      Trans-2-decenoyl-(acyl-carrier protein) isomerase   In enzymology , a trans-2-decenoyl-[acyl-carrier protein] isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   trans-dec-2-enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cis-dec-3-enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , trans-dec-2-enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein ], and one product , cis-dec-3-enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein ].  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases transposing C=C bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is decenoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] Delta2-trans-Delta3-cis-isomerase . Other names in common use include beta-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydrase , trans-2-cis-3-decenoyl-ACP isomerase , trans-2,cis-3-decenoyl-ACP isomerase , trans-2-decenoyl-ACP isomerase , and FabM .
