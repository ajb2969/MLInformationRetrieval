   Photo-Carnot engine      Photo-Carnot engine   A photo-Carnot engine is a Carnot cycle engine in which the working medium is a photon inside a cavity with perfectly reflecting walls. Radiation is the working fluid, and the piston is driven by radiation pressure .  A quantum Carnot engine is one in which the atoms in the heat bath are given a small bit of quantum coherence . The phase of the atomic coherence provides a new control parameter. 1  The deep physics behind the second law of thermodynamics is not violated; nevertheless, the quantum Carnot engine has certain features that are not possible in a classical engine.  Derivation  The internal energy of the photo-Carnot engine is proportional to the volume (unlike the ideal-gas equivalent) as well as the 4th power of the temperature (see Stefan–Boltzmann law ):       U  =   ε  σ    T  4      .      U    ε  σ   superscript  T  4      U=\varepsilon\sigma T^{4}\,.     The radiation pressure is only proportional to this 4th power of temperature but no other variables, meaning that for this photo-Carnot engine an isotherm is equivalent to an isobar:       P  =   U   3  V    =     ε  σ   T  4     3  V      .        P    U    3  V             ε  σ   superscript  T  4      3  V       P=\frac{U}{3V}=\frac{\varepsilon\sigma T^{4}}{3V}\,.     Using the first law of thermodynamics (     d  U   =    d  W   +   d  Q          d  U       d  W     d  Q      dU=dW+dQ   ) we can determine the work done through an adiabatic (     d  Q   =  0        d  Q   0    dQ=0   ) expansion by using the chain rule (     d  U   =    ε  σ  d  V   T  4    +   4  ε  σ  V   T  3   d  T          d  U       ε  σ  d  V   superscript  T  4      4  ε  σ  V   superscript  T  3   d  T      dU=\varepsilon\sigma dVT^{4}+4\varepsilon\sigma VT^{3}dT   ) and setting it equal to      d  W   =   -   P  d  V    =   -    1  3   ε  σ   T  4   d   V      .          d  W       P  d  V               1  3   ε  σ   superscript  T  4   d  V       dW=-PdV=-\frac{1}{3}\varepsilon\sigma T^{4}dV\,.     Combining these gives us      2  3    T  4   d  V   =   4  V   T  3   d  T           2  3    superscript  T  4   d  V     4  V   superscript  T  3   d  T     \frac{2}{3}T^{4}dV=4VT^{3}dT   which we can solve to find       V   1  /  6    T   =   c  o  n  s   t     .         superscript  V    1  6    T     c  o  n  s  t     \frac{V^{1/6}}{T}=const\,.     ....  The efficiency of this reversible engine must be the Carnot efficiency, regardless of the mechanism and so     η  =      T  H   -   T  C     T  H      .      η       subscript  T  H    subscript  T  C     subscript  T  H      \eta=\frac{T_{H}-T_{C}}{T_{H}}\,.
