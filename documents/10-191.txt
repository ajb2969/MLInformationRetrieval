   Giacinto Morera      Giacinto Morera   Giacinto Morera (18 July 1856 – 8 February 1909), was an Italian engineer and mathematician . He is known for Morera's theorem in the theory of functions of a complex variables and for his work in the theory of linear elasticity .  Biography  Life  He was born in Novara on 18 July 1856, the son of Giacomo Morera and Vittoria Unico . 1 According to , his family was a wealthy one, his father being a rich merchant . This occurrence eased him in his studies after the laurea : 2 however, he was an extraordinarily hard worker and he widely used this ability in his researches. 3 After studying in Turin he went to Pavia , Pisa and Leipzig : then he went back to Pavia for a brief period in 1885, and finally he went to Genova in 1886, living here for the next 15 years. While being in Genova he married his fellow-citizen Cesira Faà . 4 From 1901 on to his death he worked in Turin : 5 he died of pneumonia on 8 February 1909. 6  Education and academic career  (Figure)  Francesco Siacci , who tutored Giacinto Morera in the early stage of his career.   He earned in 1878 the laurea in engineering and then, in 1879, the laurea in mathematics, both awarded him from the Politecnico di Torino : 7 According to , the title of his thesis in the mathematical sciences was: " Sul moto di un punto attratto da due centri fissi colla legge di Newton ". 8 In Turin he attended the courses of Enrico d'Ovidio , Angelo Genocchi and especially the ones of Francesco Siacci , who was acknowledged by him as his mentor in science and life. 9 After graduating, he followed several advanced courses: he studied in Pavia from 1881 to 1882 10 under Eugenio Beltrami , Eugenio Bertini 11 and Felice Casorati . In 1883 he was in Pisa under Enrico Betti , Riccardo de Paolis and Ulisse Dini : a year later, he was in Leipzig under Felix Klein , Adolph Mayer and Carl Neumann . 12 In 1885 he went in Berlin in order to follow the lessons of Hermann von Helmholtz , Gustav Kirchhoff , Leopold Kronecker 13 and Karl Weierstrass at the local university : later in the same year, he went back to Italy , briefly working at the University of Pavia as a professor in the then newly established " Scuola di Magistero ". 14 In 1886, after passing the required competitive examination by a judging commission, 15 he became professor of rational mechanics at the University of Genova : he lived there for 15 years, serving also as dean and as rector . 16 In 1901 he was called by the University of Turin to hold the chair of rational mechanics , left vacant by Vito Volterra . 17 In 1908 he passed to the chair of "Meccanica Superiore" 18 and was elected dean of the Faculty of Sciences. 19  Honours  He was member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (first elected corresponding member on 18 July 1896, then elected national member on 26 August 1907) 20 and of the Accademia delle Scienze di Torino (elected on 9 February 1902). 21 refers that also the Kharkov Mathematical Society elected him corresponding member during the meeting of the society held on 31 October 1909 ( Old Calendar ), being apparently not aware of his death.  Tracts of his personality and attitudes  (Figure)  Carlo Somigliana , close friend and biographer of Giacinto Morera.   In his commemorative papers, Carlo Somigliana describes extensively Morera's personality: 22 according to him, he was a devoted friend and precious colleague, 23 capable of serenely judging men and facts. 24 On the very personal level, he remembers him s a cheerful person and a witty talker. 25  His intelligence is described as sharp and penetrating, 26 his mind as uncommonly lucid, 27 himself as possessing analytic and critical abilities and being versatile, capable to grasp and appreciate every kind of manifestation of the human intellect. 28 Nevertheless, Somigliana also states that he was not interested in any scientific or other kind of field outside of his own realm of expertise. 29 himself, in the inaugural address as the rector of the University of Genova, after quoting a statement attributed to Peter Guthrie Tait , 30 revealed the reason behind his views: 31 " In science, the one who has a sound and solid knowledge, even in a narrow field, holds a true strength and he can use it whenever he needs: the one who has only a superficial knowledge, however wide and striking, holds nothing, and indeed he often holds a weakness pushing him towards vanity ". 32  Acknowledged as honest, loyal and conscientious, 33 good-tempered and with a good intellect, 34 his simple manners earned him affection even when performing the duties of dean and rector at the University of Genoa . 35 Also  describes him as a man of high moral value, and ascribes to such qualities the reason of his success in social relations and in performing his duties as a civil servant.  However, despite of being successful in social relations, he did not cured nor appreciated much appearances and was not interested in activities other than teaching and doing research: consequently, he was not well known outside the circle of his family and relatives and the circle of his colleagues. 36 He did not make a display of himself, careless of being not acknowledged by everyone for his true value: he also had a serious conception of life and strongly disliked vanity and superficiality. 37  According to Somigliana, 38 his entire life was devoted to the higher unselfish ideal of scientific research : and  also remarks that only his beloved family shared the same attentions and cares he reserved to his life–long ideal.  Work  Research activity  According to Somigliana, 39 he was not particularly inventive: he did not create any new theory since this was not his main ability. 40 Instead, he perfected already developed theories: 41 nearly all of his researches appear as the natural result of a deep analysis work on theories that have already reached a high degree of perfection, 42 clearly and precisely exposed. 43 He had an exquisite sense for the applicability of his work, derived from his engineering studies, 44 and mastered perfectly all known branches of mathematical analysis and their mechanical and physical applications. 45  He authored more than 60 research works: nearly complete lists of his publications are included in the commemorative papers ,  and . In particular  classifies Morera's work by assigning each publication to particular research field: this classification is basically adopted in the following subsections. 46  Complex analysis  (Figure)  A curve   C   C   C   in a domain   D   D   D   , as required by the statement of Morera's theorem.   Morera wrote eight research works on complex analysis : 47 the style he used for their writing probably inspired Somigliana the quotation introducing the " Research activity " section. 48  Morera's theorem , probably the best known part of his scientific research, was first proved in the paper . 49 The theorem states that if, in the complex plane ℂ, the line integral of a given complex–valued  function    f   f   f   satisfies the equation        ∮  C    f   (  z  )   d  z    =  0        subscript  contour-integral  C     f  z  normal-d  z    0    \oint_{C}f(z)\,\mathrm{d}z=0     for every closed curve    C   C   C   in a given domain    D   D   D   , then   f   f   f   is holomorphic there.  Differential equations  This section includes all his works on the theory of differential equations, ordinary or partial ones:  classifies this contributions as works in the theory of the equations of dynamics , in the theory of first-order partial differential equations and in the theory of exact differential equations . 50 He wrote twelve papers on this topic: the results he obtained in these works are well described by . In the paper  he gives a very brief proof of a transformation formula for the Poisson brackets first proved by Émile Léonard Mathieu , while in the paper  he simplifies the proof of a theorem of Francesco Siacci which is substantially equivalent to Lie's third theorem : the paper  is concerned with the Pfaff problem , proving a theorem on the minimum number of integrations to be performed in order to solve the problem.  Equilibrium of continuous bodies in elasticity theory  classifies four of his works within the realm of elasticity theory : his contribution are well described by  and by  in their known monographs. The works within this section are perhaps the second best known part of his research, after his contributions to complex analysis .  Mathematical analysis  classifies four of his works under the locution " Questioni varie di Analisi ". 51  Potential theory of harmonic functions  His contribution of this topics are classified by  under two sections, named respectively " Fondamenti della teoria della funzione potenziale " 52 and " Attrazione dell'elissoide e funzioni armoniche ellissoidali ". 53 The work  deals with the definition and properties of ellipsoidal harmonics and the related Lamé functions .  Rational mechanics and mathematical physics  includes in this class twelve works: 54 his first published work  is included among them.  Varia: algebraic analysis and differential geometry  This section includes the only two papers of Morera on the subject of algebraic analysis 55 and his unique paper on differential geometry : 56 they are, respectively, the papers ,  and .  Teaching activity  References ,  and  do not say much about the teaching activity of Giacinto Morera: Somigliana 57 describes once his teaching ability as incisive. However, his teaching is also testified by the litographed  lecture notes : according to the OPAC , this book had two editions, the first one being in 1901–1902. 58  Publications    . " On the motion of a point attracted by two fixed centers according to Newton's law ", is Morera's first published paper, probably including material from his laurea thesis in mathematics.   .   . English translation of the title: " The "Fundamental theorem in the theory of canonical equations of motion" of prof. Siacci ".   . This paper was read by Enrico D'Ovidio at the meeting of the Class of Mathematical, Natural and Physical Sciences of the Accademia delle scienze di Torino , while  finished it on the February 1883 in Pisa , according to the date reported on the last page of the paper.   . This paper was read by Francesco Siacci at the meeting of the Class of Mathematical, Natural and Physical Sciences of the Accademia delle scienze di Torino , while  finished it on 15 April 1883 in Pisa , according to the date reported on the last page of the paper.   . Morera's unique paper in differential geometry .   . " A fundamental theorem in the theory of functions of a complex variable ": the paper containing the first proof of Morera's theorem.   .

" On the Cauchy integral ": a paper containing the studies of Morera on the boundary values of the Cauchy integral .   . The inaugural address pronounced in occasion of the beginning of the academic year 1888–1889 at the University of Genoa , published in the form of a pamphlet : a translation of the title reads as:-" The teaching of mathematical sciences in Italian universities ".   . " Proof of an integral calculus formula ", contains a short proof of Stokes' formula in the plane.   .   .   . Part II was read at the meeting of the Class of Mathematical, Natural and Physical Sciences of the Accademia delle scienze di Torino held a few weeks later, on 11 March 1906: see here for a brief description of the meeting, and here to access part II of the paper directly.
