Bicyclogermacrene synthase

Bicyclogermacrene synthase (, Ov-TPS4) is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (bicyclogermacrene-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
bicyclogermacrene + diphosphate


The enzyme from oregano (Origanum vulgare) gives mainly bicyclogermacrene with Mn2+ as a cofactor.
