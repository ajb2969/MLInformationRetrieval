   Bicyclogermacrene synthase      Bicyclogermacrene synthase   Bicyclogermacrene synthase (, Ov-TPS4 ) is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (bicyclogermacrene-forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    bicyclogermacrene + diphosphate    The enzyme from oregano ( Origanum vulgare ) gives mainly bicyclogermacrene with Mn 2+ as a cofactor.
