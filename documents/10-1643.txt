   Farnesol 2-isomerase      Farnesol 2-isomerase   In enzymology , a farnesol 2-isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-trans,6-trans-farnesol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-cis,6-trans-farnesol   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-trans,6-trans-farnesol , and one product , 2-cis,6-trans-farnesol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically cis-trans isomerases . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-trans,6-trans-farnesol 2-cis-trans-isomerase . This enzyme is also called farnesol isomerase .  References     "  Category:EC 5.2.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
