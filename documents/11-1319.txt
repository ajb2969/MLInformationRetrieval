   Methyl-ONN-azoxymethanol beta-D-glucosyltransferase      Methyl-ONN-azoxymethanol beta-D-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a methyl-ONN-azoxymethanol beta-D-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + methyl-ONN-azoxymethanol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + cycasin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and methyl-ONN-azoxymethanol , whereas its two products are UDP and cycasin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:methyl-ONN-azoxymethanol beta-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include cycasin synthase , uridine diphosphoglucose-methylazoxymethanol glucosyltransferase , and UDP-glucose-methylazoxymethanol glucosyltransferase .
