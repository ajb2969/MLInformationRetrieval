Minkowski's second theorem

In mathematics, Minkowski's second theorem is a result in the Geometry of numbers about the values taken by a quadratic form on a lattice and the volume of its fundamental cell.
Setting
Let K be a closed convex centrally symmetric body of positive finite volume in n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn. The gauge1 or distance23 Minkowski functional g attached to K is defined by



Conversely, given a quadratic form q on Rn we define K to be



Let Γ be a lattice in Rn. The successive minima of K, g or q on Γ are defined by setting the k-th successive minimum λk to be the infimum of the numbers λ such that λK contains k linearly independent vectors of Γ. We have 0 1 ≤ λ2 ≤ ... ≤ λn Cassels (1957) p.15645
