Apartness relation

In constructive mathematics, an apartness relation is a constructive form of inequality, and is often taken to be more basic than equality. It is often written as # to distinguish from the negation of equality (the denial inequality) â‰ , which is weaker.
Description
An apartness relation is a symmetric irreflexive binary relation with the additional condition that if two elements are apart, then any other element is apart from at least one of them (this last property is often called co-transitivity or comparison).
That is, a binary relation # is an apartness relation if it satisfies:1











The negation of an apartness relation is an equivalence relation, as the above three conditions become reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. If this equivalence relation is in fact equality, then the apartness relation is called tight. That is, # is a tight apartness relation if it additionally satisfies:

In classical mathematics, it also follows that every apartness relation is the negation of an equivalence relation, and the only tight apartness relation on a given set is the negation of equality. So in that domain, the concept is not useful. In constructive mathematics, however, this is not the case.
The prototypical apartness relation is that of the real numbers: two real numbers are said to be apart if there exists (one can construct) a rational number between them. In other words, real numbers x and y are apart if there exists a rational number z such that x f: A \rarr B where A and B are constructive setoids is called a morphism for #A and #B if
