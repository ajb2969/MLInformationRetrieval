   Galactinol—sucrose galactosyltransferase      Galactinol—sucrose galactosyltransferase   In enzymology , a galactinol-sucrose galactosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-1D-myo-inositol + sucrose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   myo-inositol + raffinose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-1D-myo-inositol and sucrose , whereas its two products are myo-inositol and raffinose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-myo-inositol:sucrose 6-alpha-D-galactosyltransferase . Other names in common use include 1-alpha-D-galactosyl-myo-inositol:sucrose , and 6-alpha-D-galactosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in galactose metabolism .
