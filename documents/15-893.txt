Very-long-chain enoyl-CoA reductase

Very-long-chain enoyl-CoA reductase (, TSC13 (gene name), CER10 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name very-long-chain acyl-CoA:NADP+ oxidoreductase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

a very-long-chain acyl-CoA + NADP+

 
  a very-long-chain trans-2,3-dehydroacyl-CoA + NADPH + H+


This is the fourth component of the elongase, a microsomal protein complex responsible for extending palmitoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA.
