   Hilbert symbol      Hilbert symbol   In mathematics , the Hilbert symbol or norm-residue symbol is a function (–, –) from K × × K × to the group of n th roots of unity in a local field  K such as the fields of reals or p-adic numbers . It is related to reciprocity laws , and can be defined in terms of the Artin symbol of local class field theory . The Hilbert symbol was introduced by  in his Zahlbericht , with the slight difference that he defined it for elements of global fields rather than for the larger local fields.  The Hilbert symbol has been generalized to higher local fields .  Quadratic Hilbert symbol  Over a local field K whose multiplicative group of non-zero elements is K × , the quadratic Hilbert symbol is the function (–, –) from K × × K × to {−1,1} defined by       (  a  ,  b  )   =   {      1  ,        if   z  2    =    a   x  2    +   b   y  2   has a non-zero solution   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )     ∈   K  3    ;         -  1   ,     if not.           a  b    cases  1        if   superscript  z  2        a   superscript  x  2      b   superscript  y  2   has a non-zero solution   x  y  z           superscript  K  3       1   if not.     (a,b)=\begin{cases}1,&\mbox{ if }z^{2}=ax^{2}+by^{2}\mbox{ has a non-zero %
 solution }(x,y,z)\in K^{3};\\
 -1,&\mbox{ if not.}\end{cases}     Properties  The following three properties follow directly from the definition, by choosing suitable solutions of the diophantine equation above:   If a is a square, then ( a , b ) = 1 for all b .  For all a , b in K × , ( a , b ) = ( b , a ).  For any a in K × such that a −1 is also in K × , we have ( a , 1− a ) = 1.   The (bi)multiplicativity, i.e.,   ( a , b 1 b 2 ) = ( a , b 1 )·( a , b 2 )   for any a , b 1 and b 2 in K × is, however, more difficult to prove, and requires the development of local class field theory .  The third property shows that the Hilbert symbol is an example of a Steinberg symbol and thus factors over the second Milnor K-group      K  2  M    (  K  )        subscript   superscript  K  M   2   K    K^{M}_{2}(K)   , which is by definition   K × ⊗ K × / ( a ⊗ (1− a) , a ∈ K × \ {1})   By the first property it even factors over      K  2  M    (  K  )    /  2         subscript   superscript  K  M   2   K   2    K^{M}_{2}(K)/2   . This is the first step towards the Milnor conjecture .  Interpretation as an algebra  The Hilbert symbol can also be used to denote the central simple algebra over K with basis 1, i , j , k and multiplication rules     i  2   =  a       superscript  i  2   a    i^{2}=a   ,     j  2   =  b       superscript  j  2   b    j^{2}=b   ,     i  j   =   -   j  i    =  k          i  j       j  i         k     ij=-ji=k   . In this case the algebra represents an element of order 2 in the Brauer group of K , which is identified with -1 if it is a division algebra and +1 if it is isomorphic to the algebra of 2 by 2 matrices.  Hilbert symbols over the rationals  For a place  v of the rational number field and rational numbers a , b we let ( a , b ) v denote the value of the Hilbert symbol in the corresponding completion  Q v . As usual, if v is the valuation attached to a prime number p then the corresponding completion is the p-adic field and if v is the infinite place then the completion is the real number field.  Over the reals, ( a , b ) ∞ is +1 if at least one of a or b is positive, and −1 if both are negative.  Over the p-adics with p odd, writing    a  =    p  α   u       a     superscript  p  α   u     a=p^{\alpha}u   and    b  =    p  β   v       b     superscript  p  β   v     b=p^{\beta}v   , where u and v are integers coprime to p , we have        (  a  ,  b  )   p   =     (   -  1   )    α  β  ϵ   (  p  )       (   u  p   )   β     (   v  p   )   α         subscript   a  b   p      superscript    1     α  β  ϵ  p     superscript    u  p   β    superscript    v  p   α      (a,b)_{p}=(-1)^{\alpha\beta\epsilon(p)}\left(\frac{u}{p}\right)^{\beta}\left(%
 \frac{v}{p}\right)^{\alpha}   , where     ϵ   (  p  )    =    (   p  -  1   )   /  2         ϵ  p       p  1   2     \epsilon(p)=(p-1)/2     and the expression involves two Legendre symbols .  Over the 2-adics, again writing    a  =    2  α   u       a     superscript  2  α   u     a=2^{\alpha}u   and    b  =    2  β   v       b     superscript  2  β   v     b=2^{\beta}v   , where u and v are odd numbers , we have        (  a  ,  b  )   2   =    (   -  1   )     ϵ   (  u  )   ϵ   (  v  )    +   α  ω   (  v  )    +   β  ω   (  u  )           subscript   a  b   2    superscript    1       ϵ  u  ϵ  v     α  ω  v     β  ω  u       (a,b)_{2}=(-1)^{\epsilon(u)\epsilon(v)+\alpha\omega(v)+\beta\omega(u)}   , where     ω   (  x  )    =    (    x  2   -  1   )   /  8.         ω  x        superscript  x  2   1   8.     \omega(x)=(x^{2}-1)/8.     It is known that if v ranges over all places, ( a , b ) v is 1 for almost all places. Therefore the following product formula        ∏  v     (  a  ,  b  )   v    =  1        subscript  product  v    subscript   a  b   v    1    \prod_{v}(a,b)_{v}=1     makes sense. It is equivalent to the law of quadratic reciprocity .  Kaplansky radical  The Hilbert symbol on a field F defines a map       (  ⋅  ,  ⋅  )   :       F  *   /   F    *  2     ×   F  *    /   F    *  2     →    B  r    (  F  )        normal-:   normal-⋅  normal-⋅    normal-→         superscript  F     superscript  F    absent  2      superscript  F      superscript  F    absent  2        B  r   F      (\cdot,\cdot):F^{*}/F^{*2}\times F^{*}/F^{*2}\rightarrow\mathop{Br}(F)     where Br( F ) is the Brauer group of F . The kernel of this mapping, the elements a such that ( a , b )=1 for all b , is the Kaplansky radical of F . 1  The radical is a subgroup of F * /F *2 , identified with a subgroup of F * . The radical contains is equal to F * if and only if F is not formally real and has u -invariant at most 2. 2 In the opposite direction, a field with radical F *2 is termed a Hilbert field . 3  The general Hilbert symbol  If K is a local field containing the group of n th roots of unity for some positive integer n prime to the characteristic of K , then the Hilbert symbol (,) is a function from K *× K * to μ n . In terms of the Artin symbol it can be defined by 4        (  a  ,  b  )    b  n    =    (  a  ,    K   (   b  n   )    /  K   )    b  n           a  b      n   b       a      K     n   b    K       n   b      (a,b)\sqrt[n]{b}=(a,K(\sqrt[n]{b})/K)\sqrt[n]{b}     Hilbert originally defined the Hilbert symbol before the Artin symbol was discovered, and his definition (for n prime) used the power residue symbol when K has residue characteristic coprime to n , and was rather complicated when K has residue characteristic dividing n .  Properties  The Hilbert symbol is (multiplicatively) bilinear:   ( ab , c ) = ( a , c )( b , c )  ( a , bc ) = ( a , b )( a , c )   skew symmetric:   ( a , b ) = ( b , a ) −1    nondegenerate:   ( a , b )=1 for all b if and only if a is in K * n    It detects norms (hence the name norm residue symbol):   ( a , b )=1 if and only if a is a norm of an element in K ( n √ b )   It has the "symbol" properties :   ( a ,1– a )=1, ( a ,–a)=1.   Hilbert's reciprocity law  Hilbert's reciprocity law states that if a and b are in an algebraic number field containing the n th roots of unity then 5        ∏  p     (  a  ,  b  )   p    =  1        subscript  product  p    subscript   a  b   p    1    \prod_{p}(a,b)_{p}=1     where the product is over the finite and infinite primes p of the number field, and where (,) p is the Hilbert symbol of the completion at p . Hilbert's reciprocity law follows from the Artin reciprocity law and the definition of the Hilbert symbol in terms of the Artin symbol.  Power residue symbol  If K is a number field containing the n th roots of unity, p is a prime ideal not dividing n , π is a prime element of the local field of p , and a is coprime to p , then the power residue symbol () is related to the Hilbert symbol by 6       (     a      p     )   =    (  π  ,  a  )   p        binomial  a  p    subscript   π  a   p     {\left({{a}\atop{p}}\right)}=(\pi,a)_{p}   The power residue symbol is extended to fractional ideals by multiplicativity, and defined for elements of the number field by putting ()=() where ( b ) is the principal ideal generated by b . Hilbert's reciprocity law then implies the following reciprocity law for the residue symbol, for a and b prime to each other and to n :       (     a      b     )   =    (     b      a     )     ∏   p  |  n  ,  ∞      (  a  ,  b  )   p          binomial  a  b      binomial  b  a     subscript  product   fragments  p  normal-|  n  normal-,      subscript   a  b   p       {\left({{a}\atop{b}}\right)}={\left({{b}\atop{a}}\right)}\prod_{p|n,\infty}(a,%
