   Slice genus      Slice genus   In mathematics , the slice genus of a smooth knot  K in S 3 (sometimes called its Murasugi genus or 4-ball genus ) is the least integer g such that K is the boundary of a connected, orientable 2-manifold S of genus g embedded in the 4-ball D 4 bounded by S 3 .  More precisely, if S is required to be smoothly embedded, then this integer g is the smooth slice genus of K and is often denoted g s ( K ) or g 4 ( K ), whereas if S is required only to be topologically locally flatly embedded then g is the topologically locally flat slice genus of K . (There is no point considering g if S is required only to be a topological embedding, since the cone on K is a 2-disk with genus 0.) There can be an arbitrarily great difference between the smooth and the topologically locally flat slice genus of a knot; a theorem of Michael Freedman says that if the Alexander polynomial of K is 1, then the topologically locally flat slice genus of K is 0, but it can be proved in many ways (originally with gauge theory ) that for every g there exist knots K such that the Alexander polynomial of K is 1 while the genus and the smooth slice genus of K both equal g .  The (smooth) slice genus of a knot K is bounded below by a quantity involving the Thurston–Bennequin invariant of K :        g  s    (  K  )    ≥    (    TB   (  K  )    +  1   )   /   2.           subscript  g  s   K         TB  K   1   2.     g_{s}(K)\geq({\rm TB}(K)+1)/2.\,     The (smooth) slice genus is zero if and only if the knot is concordant to the unknot .
