Galactosyl-N-acetylglucosaminylgalactosylglucosyl-ceramide b-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase

Galactosyl-N-acetylglucosaminylgalactosylglucosyl-ceramide beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (, uridine diphosphoacetylglucosamine-acetyllactosaminide beta1->6-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:D-galactosyl-1,4-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-1,3-beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-beta-D-glucosylceramide beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-(11)-ceramide 6-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-(11)-ceramide 
 
 
 
  UDP + N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-(1->6)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-(11)-ceramide
 

This enzyme requires Mn2+.
