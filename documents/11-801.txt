Sieve of Sundaram

In mathematics, the sieve of Sundaram is a simple deterministic algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer. It was discovered by Indian mathematician S. P. Sundaram in 1934.12
Algorithm
 Start with a list of the integers from 1 to n. From this list, remove all numbers of the form i + j + 2ij where:








The remaining numbers are doubled and incremented by one, giving a list of the odd prime numbers (i.e., all primes except 2) below 2n + 2.
The sieve of Sundaram sieves out the composite numbers just as sieve of Eratosthenes does, but even numbers are not considered; the work of "crossing out" the multiples of 2 is done by the final double-and-increment step. Whenever Eratosthenes' method would cross out k different multiples of a prime 2i+1, Sundaram's method crosses out i + j(2i+1) for 
 
 
 
 .
Correctness
If we start with integers from 1 to n, the final list contains only odd integers from 3 to 2n + 1. From this final list, some odd integers have been excluded: we must show these are precisely the composite odd integers less than 2n + 2.
Let q be an odd integer of the form 2k + 1. Then, q is excluded if and only if k is of the form i + j + 2ij, that is q = 2(i + j + 2ij) + 1. Then we have:

q = 2(i + j + 2ij) + 1

= 2i + 2j + 4ij + 1

= (2i + 1)(2j + 1).
 

So, an odd integer is excluded from the final list if and only if it has a factorization of the form (2i + 1)(2j + 1) — which is to say, if it has a non-trivial odd factor. Therefore the list must be composed of exactly the set of odd prime numbers less than or equal to 2n + 2.
