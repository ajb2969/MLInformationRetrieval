Galactarate dehydratase

In enzymology, a galactarate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-galactarate 
 
 
 
  5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucarate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, D-galactarate, and two products, 5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucarate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-galactarate hydro-lyase (5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucarate-forming). This enzyme is also called D-galactarate hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism.
