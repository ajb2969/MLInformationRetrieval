   Molybdate-transporting ATPase      Molybdate-transporting ATPase   In enzymology , a molybdate-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O + molybdateout   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + molybdatein   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , H 2 O , and molybdate , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and molybdate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (molybdate-importing) . This enzyme participates in abc transporters - general .
