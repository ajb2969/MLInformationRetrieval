   Giuseppe Vitali      Giuseppe Vitali   Giuseppe Vitali (26 August 1875 – 29 February 1932) was an Italian  mathematician who worked in several branches of mathematical analysis .  Mathematical contributions  Vitali was the first to give an example of a non-measurable subset of real numbers , see Vitali set . His covering theorem is a fundamental result in measure theory . He also proved several theorems concerning convergence of sequences of measurable and holomorphic functions. Vitali convergence theorem generalizes Lebesgue's  dominated convergence theorem . Another theorem bearing his name gives a sufficient condition for the uniform convergence of a sequence of holomorphic functions on an open domain. This result has been generalized to normal families of meromorphic functions, holomorphic functions of several complex variables , and so on.  In the last part of his life, he also worked on absolute differential calculus and on the geometry of Hilbert spaces . 1 2  See also   Vitali convergence theorem  Vitali covering theorem  Vitali-Hahn-Saks theorem  Vitali set   Bibliography    , (in Italian ).
