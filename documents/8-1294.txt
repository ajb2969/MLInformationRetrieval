Statisticians' and engineers' cross-reference of statistical terms

The following terms are used by electrical engineers in statistical signal processing studies instead of typical statistician's terms.





Statistics

Electrical engineering



Null hypothesis

Noise only hypothesis



Alternative hypothesis

Signal + noise hypothesis



Critical region

Signal present decision region



Type I error

False alarm (FA) (noted as 
 
 
 
 )



Type II error

Miss 1




In other engineering fields, particularly mechanical engineering, uncertainty analysis examines systematic and random components of variations in measurements associated with physical experiments.
