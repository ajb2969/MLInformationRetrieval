O-pyrocatechuate decarboxylase

In enzymology, an o-pyrocatechuate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2,3-dihydroxybenzoate 
 
 
 
  catechol + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, and two products, catechol and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase (catechol-forming). This enzyme is also called 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase. This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation and carbazole degradation.
