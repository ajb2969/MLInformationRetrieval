<p><strong>14:9</strong> is a compromise <a href="aspect_ratio_(image)" title="wikilink">aspect ratio</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> of 1.56:1. It is used to create an acceptable picture on both <a class="uri" href="4:3" title="wikilink">4:3</a> and <a class="uri" href="16:9" title="wikilink">16:9</a> televisions, conceived following audience tests conducted by the <a class="uri" href="BBC" title="wikilink">BBC</a>. It is used by most UK, Irish, French, Spanish and Australian terrestrial analogue networks, and in the United States on <a href="Discovery_Networks" title="wikilink">Discovery Networks</a>' HD <a class="uri" href="simulcast" title="wikilink">simulcast</a> channels with programming and advertising originally compiled in 4:3. Note that 14:9 is not a shooting format; 14:9 material is almost always derived from either a 16:9 or 4:3 shot.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<h3 id="with-native-169-material">With native 16:9 material</h3>

<p>A common usage is for material shot in 16:9 format. During production, the important action is kept within the centre of the picture, known as the 14:9 <a href="safe_area_(television)" title="wikilink">safe area</a>. When the material is broadcast in a 4:3 format (such as for <a href="analog_television" title="wikilink">analog television</a>), the sides of the image are cropped to 14:9 and narrow black bars are added to the top and bottom. It is considered that viewers who are not used to wide-screen will find this less distracting than the <a class="uri" href="letterbox" title="wikilink">letterbox</a> format that would result from broadcasting the full 16:9 picture in analogue, while still seeing more of the picture than would be visible if cropped into 4:3. When the same material is broadcast in 16:9 (such as for <a href="digital_television" title="wikilink">digital television</a>) the full 16:9 frame is left intact, but auxiliary signals tell the receiver that the picture is suitable for cropping to 14:9 if necessary (for example, when the receiver is connected to a 4:3 display).</p>

<p>The major benefit in shooting 16:9 with protection for 14:9 (rather than 4:3) is improving the usable screen real-estate for titles, logos and scrolling text. The visible enhancement is significant due to the restrictive requirements of <a class="uri" href="overscan" title="wikilink">overscan</a>. When shooting in 16:9 for potential 4:3 distribution the "<a href="Shoot_And_Protect" title="wikilink">Shoot And Protect</a>" method (from the BBC's "Widescreen Book") is employed. As the name suggests footage is shot in 16:9 but important visual information is protected inside the 14:9 or 4:3 safe areas.</p>
<h3 id="with-native-43-material">With native 4:3 material</h3>

<p>Another use is for material shot on a 4:3 format. When broadcast in 16:9, the top and bottom of the original frame are cropped to 14:9, and black bars (called <a href="pillarbox" title="wikilink">pillarboxes</a>) are added to either side. When broadcast in 4:3, the 14:9 crop is often used in preference to the original 4:3 frame. This is especially common when 4:3 footage needs to be included in an otherwise 16:9 program, such as a news broadcast, and is used by the BBC 'Kids' channels (<a class="uri" href="CBBC" title="wikilink">CBBC</a> &amp; <a class="uri" href="CBeebies" title="wikilink">CBeebies</a>) to broadcast older children's programming shot is 4:3 (e.g. aging schools programming) on a larger proportion of a 16:9 screen. In the case of BBC Kids, additional graphics are added to the <a class="uri" href="pillarbox" title="wikilink">pillarbox</a> area instead of leaving it black.</p>
<h3 id="adoption-by-tv-channels">Adoption by TV channels</h3>
<h4 id="uk">UK</h4>

<p>In the UK, most channels broadcast in 16:9, but some channels such as <a href="Nickelodeon_(UK_&amp;_Ireland)" title="wikilink">Nickelodeon</a> also use 14:9. On these channels, the 14:9 cropping is used on adverts and shows which were produced in 16:9, such as <a href="House_of_Anubis" title="wikilink">House of Anubis</a>, <a class="uri" href="iCarly" title="wikilink">iCarly</a>, <a class="uri" href="Victorious" title="wikilink">Victorious</a> and <a href="Big_Time_Rush" title="wikilink">Big Time Rush</a>, to present a more consistent output. <a href="Nickelodeon_(UK_&amp;_Ireland)" title="wikilink">Nickelodeon (UK &amp; Ireland)</a> (and sister channels <a href="Nick_Jr._(UK_&amp;_Ireland)" title="wikilink">Nick Jr. (UK &amp; Ireland)</a> and <a href="Nicktoons_(UK_&amp;_Ireland)" title="wikilink">Nicktoons (UK &amp; Ireland)</a>) are the only kids channel that are not shown in 16:9 but will make the switch in 2013. The HD channel, <a href="Nickelodeon_(UK_&amp;_Ireland)" title="wikilink">Nickelodeon HD</a> is shown 16:9, with 4:3 programming shown in the <a class="uri" href="pillarbox" title="wikilink">pillarbox</a> effect.</p>
<h4 id="argentina">Argentina</h4>

<p>It is also used on the <a class="uri" href="ISDB-Tb" title="wikilink">ISDB-Tb</a> HD service of the Argentinian public television, <a href="TV_Pública" title="wikilink">TV Pública</a>, in order to adjust their old programs and 4:3 SD studio cameras to 16:9 format.</p>
<h4 id="portugal">Portugal</h4>

<p>The public broadcaster <a href="Rádio_e_Televisão_de_Portugal" title="wikilink">RTP</a> used the 14:9 format to convert 16:9 broadcasts to the 4:3 format it still uses. However, since June 8, 2012, they began to broadcast 16:9 material in its original aspect ratio, with the correct flag, thus ending the broadcasts featuring the 14:9 format. Private broadcaster <a href="Televisão_Independente" title="wikilink">TVI</a> started using the 14:9 format in August 2012 to broadcast 16:9 material instead of using 4:3 Pan &amp; Scan, as they refuse to broadcast in 16:9.</p>
<h4 id="germany">Germany</h4>

<p><a href="Viacom" title="wikilink">VIACOM</a> uses the 14:9 format to convert 4:3 programming to 16:9.</p>

<p>The aspect ratio of 14:9 (1.555...) is the <a href="arithmetic_mean" title="wikilink">arithmetic mean</a> (average) of 16:9 and 4:3 = 12:9, since the average of 16 and 12 is 14. More practically, it is approximately the <a href="geometric_mean" title="wikilink">geometric mean</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> (the precise geometric mean is

), and in this sense is mathematically a compromise between these two aspect ratios: two equal area pictures (at 16:9 and 4:3) will intersect in a box with aspect ratio the geometric mean, as demonstrated in the image at top (14:9 is just slightly wider than the intersection). In this way 14:9 balances the needs of both 16:9 and 4:3, cropping or distorting both about equally; similar considerations were used in <a href="Aspect_ratio_(image)#Why_16:9_was_chosen_by_the_SMPTE" title="wikilink">the choice of 16:9</a> by the <a class="uri" href="SMPTE" title="wikilink">SMPTE</a>, there balancing 2.35 and 4:3.</p>
