Constructive function theory

In mathematical analysis, constructive function theory is a field which studies the connection between the smoothness of a function and its degree of approximation.12 It is closely related to approximation theory. The term was coined by Sergei Bernstein.
Example
Let f be a 2π-periodic function. Then f is α-Hölder for some 0 n'' of degree n such that


 
  where C(f) is a positive number depending on f. The "only if" is due to Dunham Jackson, see Jackson's inequality; the "if" part is due to Sergei Bernstein, see Bernstein's theorem (approximation theory).
