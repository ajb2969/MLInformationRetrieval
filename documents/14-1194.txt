   Constructive function theory      Constructive function theory   In mathematical analysis , constructive function theory is a field which studies the connection between the smoothness of a function and its degree of approximation . 1 2 It is closely related to approximation theory . The term was coined by Sergei Bernstein .  Example  Let f be a 2 π -periodic function. Then f is α - Hölder for some 0 n'' of degree n such that         max   0  ≤  x  ≤   2  π      |    f   (  x  )    -    P  n    (  x  )     |    ≤    C   (  f  )     n  α     ,        subscript       0  x         2  π            f  x      subscript  P  n   x          C  f    superscript  n  α      \max_{0\leq x\leq 2\pi}|f(x)-P_{n}(x)|\leq\frac{C(f)}{n^{\alpha}},   where C ( f ) is a positive number depending on f . The "only if" is due to Dunham Jackson , see Jackson's inequality ; the "if" part is due to Sergei Bernstein , see Bernstein's theorem (approximation theory) .
