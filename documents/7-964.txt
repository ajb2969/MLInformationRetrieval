Cofunction

 In mathematics, a function f is cofunction of a function g if f(A) = g(B) whenever A and B are complementary angles. This definition typically applies to trigonometric functions.1
For example, sine and cosine are cofunctions of each other (hence the "co" in "cosine"):
















The same is true of secant and cosecant and of tangent and cotangent:


























These equations are also known as the cofunction identities.2
