   Cofunction      Cofunction   In mathematics , a function  f is cofunction of a function g if f ( A ) = g ( B ) whenever A and B are complementary angles . This definition typically applies to trigonometric functions . 1  For example, sine and cosine are cofunctions of each other (hence the "co" in "cosine"):           sin   (    π  2   -  A   )    =   cos   (  A  )              π  2   A      A     \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-A\right)=\cos(A)           cos   (    π  2   -  A   )    =   sin   (  A  )              π  2   A      A     \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-A\right)=\sin(A)          The same is true of secant and cosecant and of tangent and cotangent:           sec   (    π  2   -  A   )    =   csc   (  A  )              π  2   A      A     \sec\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-A\right)=\csc(A)           csc   (    π  2   -  A   )    =   sec   (  A  )              π  2   A      A     \csc\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-A\right)=\sec(A)             tan   (    π  2   -  A   )    =   cot   (  A  )              π  2   A      A     \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-A\right)=\cot(A)           cot   (    π  2   -  A   )    =   tan   (  A  )              π  2   A      A     \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-A\right)=\tan(A)          These equations are also known as the cofunction identities . 2  References  "  Category:Trigonometry     . ↩
