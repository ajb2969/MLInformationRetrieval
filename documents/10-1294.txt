   Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NADP+) (phosphorylating)      Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NADP+) (phosphorylating)   In enzymology , a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NADP+) (phosphorylating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + phosphate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate + NADPH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate , phosphate , and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate , NADPH , and H + .  Function  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. This enzyme participates in the Calvin cycle which is an autotrophic  carbon fixation pathway.  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (phosphorylating). Other names in common use include:   dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde phosphate (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) (phosphorylating)  GAPDH  glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) (phosphorylating)  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NADP) (phosphorylating)  NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase  NADP-glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase  NADP-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  NADP-triose phosphate dehydrogenase  triosephosphate dehydrogenase (NADP)   References  Further reading       "  Category:EC 1.2.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of known structure
