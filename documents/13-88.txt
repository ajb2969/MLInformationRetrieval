Phytoene synthase

Phytoene synthase (, prephytoene-diphosphate synthase, 15-cis-phytoene synthase, PSase, geranylgeranyl-diphosphate geranylgeranyltransferase) is a transferase enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of carotenoids. It catalyzes the conversion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to phytoene.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2 geranylgeranyl diphosphate

 
  15-cis-phytoene + 2 diphosphate (overall reaction)
 
(1a) 2 geranylgeranyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + prephytoene diphosphate

(1b) prephytoene diphosphate 
 
 
 
  15-cis-phytoene + diphosphate
 

This enzyme requires Mn2+ for activity. It belongs to squalene/phytoene synthase family of proteins.
