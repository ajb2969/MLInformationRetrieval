On the sides BC, CA, AB of the triangle, construct outwardly drawn three squares with centres     O  a   ,   O  b   ,   O  c       subscript  O  a    subscript  O  b    subscript  O  c     O_{a},O_{b},O_{c}   respectively. Then the lines     A   O  a    ,   B   O  b         A   subscript  O  a      B   subscript  O  b      AO_{a},BO_{b}   and    C   O  c       C   subscript  O  c     CO_{c}   are concurrent. The point of concurrence outer is Vecten point of the triangle ABC.  In Clark Kimberling 's Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers , the outer Vecten point is denoted by X(485). 1 The Vecten points are named after an early 19th-century French mathematician named Vecten, who taught mathematics with Gergonne in Nîmes and published a study of the figure of three squares on the sides of a triangle in 1817. 2  Inner Vecten point  Let ABC be any given plane  triangle . On the sides BC, CA, AB of the triangle, construct inwardly drawn three squares respectively with centres     I  a   ,   I  b   ,   I  c       subscript  I  a    subscript  I  b    subscript  I  c     I_{a},I_{b},I_{c}   respectively. Then the lines     A   I  a    ,   B   I  b         A   subscript  I  a      B   subscript  I  b      AI_{a},BI_{b}   and    C   I  c       C   subscript  I  c     CI_{c}   are concurrent. The point of concurrence is inner Vecten point of the triangle ABC.  In Clark Kimberling 's Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers , the inner Vecten point is denoted by X(486). 3  The line    X   (  485  )   X   (  486  )       X  485  X  486    X(485)X(486)   meets the Euler line at the Nine point center of the triangle    A  B  C      A  B  C    ABC   . The Vecten points lie on the Kiepert hyperbola  See also   Napoleon points , a pair of triangle centers constructed in an analogous way using equilateral triangles instead of squares   References  External links     "  Category:Triangle centers     ↩  . ↩  ↩
