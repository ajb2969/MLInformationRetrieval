Mazur manifold

In differential topology, a branch of mathematics, a Mazur manifold is a contractible, compact, smooth 4-dimensional manifold (with boundary) which is not diffeomorphic to the standard 4-ball. The boundary of a Mazur manifold is necessarily a homology 3-sphere.
Frequently the term Mazur manifold is restricted to a special class of the above definition: 4-manifolds that have a handle decomposition containing exactly three handles: a single 0-handle, a single 1-handle and single 2-handle. This is equivalent to saying the manifold must be of the form 
 
 
 
  union a 2-handle. An observation of Mazur's shows that the double of such manifolds is diffeomorphic to 
 
 
 
  with the standard smooth structure.
Some properties
In general the double of a Mazur manifold is a homotopy 4-sphere, thus such manifolds are a source of possible counter-examples to the smooth Poincaré conjecture in dimension 4.
History
Barry Mazur1 and Valentin Poenaru2 discovered these manifolds simultaneously. Akbulut and Kirby showed that the Brieskorn homology spheres

 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are boundaries of Mazur manifolds.3 This results were later generalized to other contractible manifolds by Casson, Harer and Stern.456 One of the Mazur manifolds is also an example of an Akbulut cork7 which can be used to construct exotic 4-manifolds.8
Mazur manifolds have been used by Fintushel and Stern9 to construct exotic actions of a group of order 2 on the 4-sphere.
Mazur's discovery was surprising for several reasons:
:* Every smooth homology sphere in dimension 
 
 
 
  is homeomorphic to the boundary of a compact contractible smooth manifold. This follows from the work of Kervaire10 and the h-cobordism theorem. Slightly more strongly, every smooth homology 4-sphere is diffeomorphic to the boundary of a compact contractible smooth 5-manifold (also by the work of Kervaire). But not every homology 3-sphere is diffeomorphic to the boundary of a contractible compact smooth 4-manifold. For example, the Poincaré homology sphere does not bound such a 4-manifold because the Rochlin invariant provides an obstruction.
:* The H-cobordism Theorem implies that, at least in dimensions 
 
 
 
  there is a unique contractible 
 
 
 
 -manifold with simply-connected boundary, where uniqueness is up to diffeomorphism. This manifold is the unit ball 
 
 
 
 
 . It's an open problem as to whether or not 
 
 
 
  admits an exotic smooth structure, but by the h-cobordism theorem, such an exotic smooth structure, if it exists, must restrict to an exotic smooth structure on 
 
 
 
 . Whether or not 
 
 
 
  admits an exotic smooth structure is equivalent to another open problem, the smooth Poincaré conjecture in dimension four. Whether or not 
 
 
 
  admits an exotic smooth structure is another open problem, closely linked to the Schoenflies problem in dimension four.
Mazur's Observation
Let 
 
 
 
 
  be a Mazur manifold that is constructed as 
 
 
 
  union a 2-handle. Here is a sketch of Mazur's argument that the double of such a Mazur manifold is 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is a contractible 5-manifold constructed as 
 
 
 
  union a 2-handle. The 2-handle can be unknotted since the attaching map is a framed knot in the 4-manifold 
 
 
 
 
 . So 
 
 
 
  union the 2-handle is diffeomorphic to 
 
 
 
 . The boundary of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . But the boundary of 
 
 
 
 
  is the double of 
 
 
 
 .
