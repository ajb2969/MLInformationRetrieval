   Conjugate closure      Conjugate closure   In group theory , the conjugate closure of a subset  S of a group  G is the subgroup of G  generated by S G , i.e. the closure of S G under the group operation, where S G is the set of the conjugates of the elements of S :   S G = { g −1 sg | g ∈ G and s ∈ S }   The conjugate closure of S is denoted G > or G .  The conjugate closure of any subset S of a group G is always a normal subgroup of G ; in fact, it is the smallest (by inclusion) normal subgroup of G which contains S . For this reason, the conjugate closure is also called the normal closure of S or the normal subgroup generated by  S . The normal closure can also be characterized as the intersection of all normal subgroups of G which contain S . Any normal subgroup is equal to its normal closure.  The conjugate closure of a singleton subset { a } of a group G is a normal subgroup generated by a and all elements of G which are conjugate to a . Therefore, any simple group is the conjugate closure of any non-identity group element. The conjugate closure of the empty set   ∅     \varnothing   is the trivial group .  Contrast the normal closure of S with the normalizer of S , which is (for S a group) the largest subgroup of G in which S  itself is normal. (This need not be normal in the larger group G , just as  need not be normal in its conjugate/normal closure.)  Dual to the concept of normal closure is that of normal interior or normal core , defined as the join of all normal subgroups contained in S . 1  References      "  Category:Group theory     Robinson p.16 ↩
