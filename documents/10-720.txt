The code is released as free and open source software under the GNU General Public License . It is managed, maintained and distributed by The OpenFOAM Foundation, 1 which is supported by voluntary contributors.  History  OpenFOAM (originally, FOAM) was created by Henry Weller from the late 1980s at Imperial College , London, to develop a more powerful and flexible general simulation platform than the de facto standard at the time, FORTRAN . This led to the choice of C++ as programming language, due to its modularity and object oriented features. In 2004, Henry Weller, Chris Greenshields and Mattijs Janssens founded OpenCFD Ltd to develop and release OpenFOAM. 2 On 8 August 2011, OpenCFD was acquired by Silicon Graphics International (SGI). 3 At the same time, the copyright of OpenFOAM was transferred to the OpenFOAM Foundation , a newly founded, not-for-profit organisation that manages OpenFOAM and distributes it to the general public. On 12 September 2012, the ESI Group announced the acquisition of OpenCFD Ltd from SGI. 4 In 2014, Weller and Greenshields left ESI Group and continue the development and management of OpenFOAM, on behalf of the OpenFOAM Foundation, at CFD Direct. 5  Distinguishing features  Syntax  One distinguishing feature of OpenFOAM is its syntax for tensor operations and partial differential equations that closely resembles the equations being solved. For example the equation 6          ‚àÇ   œÅ  ùêî     ‚àÇ  t    +    ‚àá  ‚ãÖ  œï   ùêî    -    ‚àá  ‚ãÖ  Œº    ‚àá  ùêî     =   -   ‚àá  p                  œÅ  ùêî      t       normal-‚ãÖ  normal-‚àá  œï   ùêî       normal-‚ãÖ  normal-‚àá  Œº    normal-‚àá  ùêî        normal-‚àá  p      \frac{\partial\rho\mathbf{U}}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot\phi\mathbf{U}-\nabla%
 \cdot\mu\nabla\mathbf{U}=-\nabla p     is represented by the code  solve
 (
      fvm::ddt(rho,U)
    + fvm::div(phi,U)
    - fvm::laplacian(mu,U)
   ==
    - fvc::grad(p)
 );  This syntax, achieved through the use of object oriented programming and operator overloading , enables users to create custom solvers with relative ease. However, code customization becomes more challenging with increasing depth into the OpenFOAM library, owing to a lack of documentation, and heavy use of template metaprogramming .  Extensibility  Users can create custom objects, such as boundary conditions or turbulence models, that will work with existing solvers without having to modify or recompile the existing source code. OpenFOAM accomplishes this by combining virtual constructors with the use of simplified base classes as interfaces . As a result, this gives OpenFOAM good extensibility qualities. OpenFOAM refers to this capability as run-time selection 7  Structure of OpenFOAM  OpenFOAM is constituted by a large base library , which offers the core capabilities of the code:   Tensor and field operations  Discretization of partial differential equations using a human-readable syntax  Solution of linear systems 8  Solution of ordinary differential equations 9  Automatic parallelization of high-level operations  Dynamic mesh 10  General physical models  Rheological models 11  Thermodynamic models and database 12  Turbulence models 13  Chemical reaction and kinetics models 14  Lagrangian particle tracking methods 15  Radiative heat transfer models  Multi-reference frame and single-reference frame methodologies    The capabilities provided by the library are then used to develop applications . Applications are written using the high-level syntax introduced by OpenFOAM, which aims at reproducing the conventional mathematical notation. Two categories of applications exist:   Solvers: they perform the actual calculation to solve a specific continuum mechanics problem  Utilities: they are used to prepare the mesh, set-up the simulation case, process the results, and to perform operations other than solving the problem under examination   Each application provides specific capabilities: for example the application called blockMesh is used to generate meshes from an input file provided by the user, while another application called icoFoam solves the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible laminar flow.  Finally, a set of third-party packages are used to provide parallel functionality (i.e. OpenMPI ) and graphical post-processing ( ParaView ).  Capabilities  OpenFOAM solvers include: 16    Basic CFD solvers  Incompressible flow with RANS and LES capabilities 17  Compressible flow solvers with RANS and LES capabilities 18  Buoyancy-driven flow solvers 19  DNS and LES  Multiphase flow solvers 20  Particle-tracking solvers  Solvers for combustion problems 21  Solvers for conjugate heat transfer 22  Molecular dynamics solvers 23  Direct Simulation Monte Carlo solvers 24  Electromagnetics solvers 25  Solid dynamics solvers 26   In addition to the standard solvers, OpenFOAM's syntax lends itself to the easy creation of custom solvers.  OpenFOAM utilities are subdivided into:   Mesh utilities  Mesh generation: they generate computational grids starting either from an input file (blockMesh), or from a generic geometry specified as STL file, which is meshed automatically with hex-dominant grids (snappyHexMesh)  Mesh conversion: they convert grids generated using other tools to the OpenFOAM format  Mesh manipulation: they perform specific operations on the mesh such as localized refinement, definition of regions, and others   Parallel processing utilities: they provide tools to decompose, reconstruct and re-distribute the computational case to perform parallel calculations  Pre-processing utilities: tools to prepare the simulation cases  Post-processing utilities: tools to process the results of simulation cases, including a plugin to interface OpenFOAM and ParaView .  Surface utilities  Thermophysical utilities   License  OpenFOAM is free and open source software, released under the GNU General Public License version 3. 27  Advantages and disadvantages  Advantages   Friendly syntax for partial differential equations  Unstructured polyhedral grid capabilities  Automatic parallelization of applications written using OpenFOAM high-level syntax  Wide range of applications and models ready to use  Commercial support and training provided by the developers  No license costs   Disadvantages   Absence of an integrated graphical user interface (stand-alone Open Source and proprietary options are available)  The Programmer's guide does not provide sufficient details, making the learning curve very steep if you need to write new applications or add functionality   Forks and adaptations  Free software   blueCFD is a cross-compiled version of OpenFOAM that runs on Windows operating systems, and is derived from OpenFlow .
