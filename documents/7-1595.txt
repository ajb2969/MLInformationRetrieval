   Holomorphically separable      Holomorphically separable   In mathematics in complex analysis , the concept of holomorphic separability is a measure for the richness of the set of holomorphic functions on a complex manifold or complex-analytic space .  Formal definition  A complex manifold or complex space    X   X   X   is said to be holomorphically separable , if whenever x ‚â† y are two points in   X   X   X   , there exists a holomorphic function     f  ‚àà   ùí™   (  X  )        f    ùí™  X     f\in\mathcal{O}(X)   , such that f ( x ) ‚â† f ( y ).  Often one says the holomorphic functions  separate points .  Usage and examples   All complex manifolds that can be mapped injectively into some    ‚ÑÇ  n     superscript  ‚ÑÇ  n    \mathbb{C}^{n}   are holomorphically separable, in particular, all domains in    ‚ÑÇ  n     superscript  ‚ÑÇ  n    \mathbb{C}^{n}   and all Stein manifolds .  A holomorphically separable complex manifold is not compact unless it is discrete and finite.  The condition is part of the definition of a Stein manifold .   "  Category:Complex analysis
