Long-chain-fatty-acid—(acyl-carrier-protein) ligase




Long-chain-fatty-acid—(acyl-carrier-protein) ligase

In enzymology, a long-chain-fatty-acid-[acyl-carrier-protein] ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + an acid + [acyl-carrier-protein] 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, acid, and acyl-carrier-protein, whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein].
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is long-chain-fatty-acid:[acyl-carrier-protein] ligase (AMP-forming). Other names in common use include acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthetase, acyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthetase, acyl-ACP synthetase, acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]synthetase, stearoyl-ACP synthetase, and acyl-acyl carrier protein synthetase. This enzyme participates in fatty acid metabolism.
