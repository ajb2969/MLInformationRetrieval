   Conductivity near the percolation threshold      Conductivity near the percolation threshold   In a mixture between a dielectric and a metallic component, the conductivity    σ   σ   \sigma   and the dielectric constant    ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   of this mixture show a critical behavior if the fraction of the metallic component reaches the percolation threshold . 1 The behavior of the conductivity near this percolation threshold will show a smooth change over from the conductivity of the dielectric component to the conductivity of the metallic component and can be described using two critical exponents s and t, whereas the dielectric constant will diverge if the threshold is approached from either side. To include the frequency dependent behavior, a resistor - capacitor model (R-C model) is used.  Geometrical percolation  For describing such a mixture of a dielectric and a metallic component we use the model of bond-percolation. On a regular lattice, the bond between two nearest neighbors can either be occupied with probability   p   p   p   or not occupied with probability    1  -  p      1  p    1-p   . There exists a critical value    p  c     subscript  p  c    p_{c}   . For occupation probabilities    p  >   p  c       p   subscript  p  c     p>p_{c}   an infinite cluster of the occupied bonds is formed. This value    p  c     subscript  p  c    p_{c}   is called the percolation threshold. The region near to this percolation threshold can be described by the two critical exponents   ν   ν   \nu   and   β   β   \beta   (see Percolation critical exponents ).  With these critical exponents we have the correlation length ,   ξ   ξ   \xi        ξ   (  p  )    ∝    (    p  c   -  p   )    -  ν       proportional-to    ξ  p    superscript     subscript  p  c   p     ν      \xi(p)\propto(p_{c}-p)^{-\nu}     and the percolation probability , P:       P   (  p  )    ∝    (   p  -   p  c    )   β      proportional-to    P  p    superscript    p   subscript  p  c    β     P(p)\propto(p-p_{c})^{\beta}     Electrical percolation  For the description of the electrical percolation, we identify the occupied bonds of the bond-percolation model with the metallic component having a conductivity    σ  m     subscript  σ  m    \sigma_{m}   . And the dielectric component with conductivity    σ  d     subscript  σ  d    \sigma_{d}   corresponds to non-occupied bonds. We consider the two following well-known cases of a conductor-insulator mixture and a superconductor–conductor mixture .  Conductor-insulator mixture  In the case of a conductor-insulator mixture we have     σ  d   =  0       subscript  σ  d   0    \sigma_{d}=0   . This case describes the behaviour, if the percolation threshold is approached from above:        σ   D  C     (  p  )    ∝    σ  m     (   p  -   p  c    )   t       proportional-to     subscript  σ    D  C    p      subscript  σ  m    superscript    p   subscript  p  c    t      \sigma_{DC}(p)\propto\sigma_{m}(p-p_{c})^{t}     for    p  >   p  c       p   subscript  p  c     p>p_{c}     Below the percolation threshold we have no conductivity, because of the perfect insulator and just finite metallic clusters. The exponent t is one of the two critical exponents for electrical percolation.  Superconductor–conductor mixture  In the other well-known case of a superconductor -conductor mixture we have     σ  m   =  ∞       subscript  σ  m      \sigma_{m}=\infty   . This case is useful for the description below the percolation threshold:        σ   D  C     (  p  )    ∝    σ  d     (    p  c   -  p   )    -  s        proportional-to     subscript  σ    D  C    p      subscript  σ  d    superscript     subscript  p  c   p     s       \sigma_{DC}(p)\propto\sigma_{d}(p_{c}-p)^{-s}     for    p  <   p  c       p   subscript  p  c     p     Now, above the percolation threshold the conductivity becomes infinite, because of the infinite superconducting clusters. And also we get the second critical exponent s for the electrical percolation.  Conductivity near the percolation threshold  In the region around the percolation threshold, the conductivity assumes a scaling form: 2      σ   (  p  )    ∝    σ  m     |   Δ  p   |   t    Φ  ±    (   h    |   Δ  p   |     -  s   -  t     )       proportional-to    σ  p      subscript  σ  m    superscript      normal-Δ  p    t    subscript  normal-Φ  plus-or-minus     h   superscript      normal-Δ  p        s   t        \sigma(p)\propto\sigma_{m}|\Delta p|^{t}\Phi_{\pm}\left(h|\Delta p|^{-s-t}\right)     with     Δ  p   ≡   p  -   p  c          normal-Δ  p     p   subscript  p  c      \Delta p\equiv p-p_{c}   and    h  ≡    σ  d    σ  m        h     subscript  σ  d    subscript  σ  m      h\equiv\frac{\sigma_{d}}{\sigma_{m}}     At the percolation threshold, the conductivity reaches the value: 3       σ   D  C     (   p  c   )    ∝    σ  m     (    σ  d    σ  m    )   u       proportional-to     subscript  σ    D  C     subscript  p  c       subscript  σ  m    superscript     subscript  σ  d    subscript  σ  m    u      \sigma_{DC}(p_{c})\propto\sigma_{m}\left(\frac{\sigma_{d}}{\sigma_{m}}\right)^%

For the real part of the dielectric constant we have: 7      ϵ  1    (  ω  =  0  ,  p  )   =    ϵ  d     |   p  -   p  c    |   s       fragments   subscript  ϵ  1    fragments  normal-(  ω   0  normal-,  p  normal-)       subscript  ϵ  d    superscript      p   subscript  p  c     s      \epsilon_{1}(\omega=0,p)=\frac{\epsilon_{d}}{|p-p_{c}|^{s}}     The R-C model  Within the R-C model, the bonds in the percolation model are represented by pure resistors with conductivity     σ  m   =   1  /  R        subscript  σ  m     1  R     \sigma_{m}=1/R   for the occupied bonds and by perfect capacitors with conductivity     σ  d   =   i  C  ω        subscript  σ  d     i  C  ω     \sigma_{d}=iC\omega   (where   ω   ω   \omega   represents the angular frequency ) for the non-occupied bonds. Now the scaling law takes the form: 8      σ   (  p  ,  ω  )    ∝    1  R     |   Δ  p   |   t    Φ  ±    (     i  ω    ω  0      |   Δ  p   |    -   (   s  +  t   )      )       proportional-to    σ   p  ω        1  R    superscript      normal-Δ  p    t    subscript  normal-Φ  plus-or-minus         i  ω    subscript  ω  0     superscript      normal-Δ  p        s  t         \sigma(p,\omega)\propto\frac{1}{R}|\Delta p|^{t}\Phi_{\pm}\left(\frac{i\omega}%
 {\omega_{0}}|\Delta p|^{-(s+t)}\right)     This scaling law contains a purely imaginary scaling variable and a critical time scale       τ  *   =    1   ω  0      |   Δ  p   |    -   (   s  +  t   )           superscript  τ        1   subscript  ω  0     superscript      normal-Δ  p        s  t        \tau^{*}=\frac{1}{\omega_{0}}|\Delta p|^{-(s+t)}     which diverges if the percolation threshold is approached from above as well as from below. 9  References  See also   Percolation theory  Percolation threshold   "  Category:Critical phenomena
