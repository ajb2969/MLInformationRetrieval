   Isoflavone 3'-hydroxylase      Isoflavone 3'-hydroxylase   In enzymology , an isoflavone 3'-hydroxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   formononetin + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   calycosin + NADP + + H 2 O   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are formononetin , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are calycosin , NADP + , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is formononetin,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (3'-hydroxylating) . This enzyme is also called isoflavone 3'-monooxygenase . This enzyme participates in isoflavonoid biosynthesis . It employs one cofactor , heme .
