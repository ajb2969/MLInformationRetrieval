Network calculus

Network calculus is "a set of mathematical results which give insights into man-made systems such as concurrent programs, digital circuits and communication networks."1 Network calculus gives a theoretical framework for analysing performance guarantees in computer networks. As traffic flows through a network it is subject to constraints imposed by the system components, for example:

link capacity
traffic shapers (leaky buckets)
congestion control
background traffic

These constraints can be expressed and analysed with network calculus methods. Constraint curves can be combined using convolution under min-plus algebra. Network calculus can also be used to express traffic arrival and departure functions as well as service curves.
The calculus uses "alternate algebras ... to transform complex non-linear network systems into analytically tractable linear systems."2
Currently, there exists two branches in network calculus: one handling deterministic bounded, and one handling stochastic bounds .3 This article is only about deterministic network calculus.
System modelling
Modelling flow and server
In network calculus, a flow is modelled as cumulative functions 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  represents the amount of data (number of bits for example) send by the flow in the interval 
 
 
 
 . Such functions are non-negative and non-decreasing. The time domain is often the set of non negative reals.

A server can be a link, a scheduler, a traffic shaper, or a whole network. It is simply modelled as a relation between some arrival cumulative curve 
 
 
 
  and some departure cumulative curve 
 
 
 
 . It is required that 
 
 
 
 , to model the fact that the departure of some data can not occur before its arrival.
Modelling backlog and delay
Given some arrival and departure curve 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the backlog at any instant 
 
 
 
 , denoted 
 
 
 
  can be defined as the difference between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The delay at 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is defined as the minimal amount of time such that the departure function reached the arrival function. When considering the whole flows, the supremum of these values is used.

In general, the flows are not exactly known, and only some constraints on flows and servers are known (like the maximal number of packet sent on some period, the maximal size of packets, the minimal link bandwidth). The aim of network calculus is to compute upper bounds on delay and backlog, based on these constraints. To do so, network calculus uses the min-plus algebra.
Min-plus algebra
In filter theory respectively linear systems theory the convolution of two functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is defined as



In min-plus algebra the sum is replaced by the minimum respectively infimum operator and the product is replaced by the sum. So the min-plus convolution of two functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  becomes



e.g. see the definition of service curves. Convolution and min-plus convolution share many algebraic properties. In particular both are commutative and associative.
A so-called min-plus de-convolution operation is defined as



e.g. as used in the definition of traffic envelopes.
The vertical and horizontal deviations can be expressed in terms of min-plus operators.




Traffic envelopes
Cumulative curves are real behaviours, unknown at design time. What is known is some constraint. Network calculus uses the notion of traffic envelope, also known as arrival curves.
A cumulative function 
 
 
 
  is said to conform to an envelope (or arrival curve) 
 
 
 
 , iff for all 
 
 
 
  it holds that



Two equivalent definitions can be given  
 
 

Thus, 
 
 
 
  places an upper constraint on flow 
 
 
 
 . Such function 
 
 
 
  can be seen as an envelope that specifies an upper bound on the number of bits of flow seen in any interval of length 
 
 
 
  starting at an arbitrary 
 
 
 
 , cf. eq. ().
Service curves
In order to provide performance guarantees to traffic flows it is necessary to specify some minimal performance of the server (depending on reservations in the network, or scheduling policy, etc.). Service curves provide a means of expressing resource availability. Several kinds of service curves exists, like weakly strict, variable capacity node, etc. See 4 5 for an overview.
Minimal service
Let 
 
 
 
  be an arrival flow, arriving at the ingress of a server, and 
 
 
 
  be the flow departing at the egress. The system is said to provide a simple minimal service curve

 
  to the pair 
 
 
 
 , if for all 
 
 
 
  it holds that 
 
 

Strict minimal service
Let 
 
 
 
  be an arrival flow, arriving at the ingress of a server, and 
 
 
 
  be the flow departing at the egress. A backlog period is an interval 
 
 
 
  such that, on any 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
The system is said to provide a strict minimal service curve

 
  to the pair 
 
 
 
  iff, 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
 , if 
 
 
 
  is a backlog period, then 
 
 
 
 .
If a server offers a strict minimal service of curve 
 
 
 
 , it also offers a simple minimal service of curve 
 
 
 
 .
Basic results: Performance bounds and envelope propagation
From traffic envelope and service curves, some bounds on the delay and backlog, and an envelope on the departure flow can be computed.
Let 
 
 
 
  be an arrival flow, arriving at the ingress of a server, and 
 
 
 
  be the flow departing at the egress. If the flow as a traffic envelope 
 
 
 
 , and the server provides a minimal service of curve 
 
 
 
 , then the backlog and delay can be bounded:




Moreover, the departure curve has envelope 
 
 
 
 .
Moreover, these bounds are tight i.e. given some 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , one may build an arrival and departure such that 
 
 
 
  = 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 =
 
 
 
 .
Concatenation / PBOO
Consider a sequence of two servers, when the output of the first one is the input of the second one. This sequence can be seen as a new server, build as the concatenation of the two others ones.
Then, if the first (resp. second) server servers offers a simple minimal service 
 
 
 
  (resp. 
 
 
 
 ), then, the concatenation of both offers a simple minimal service 
 
 
 
 .

The proof does iterative application of the definition of service curves 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and some properties of convolution, isotonicity (
 
 
 
 ), and associativity (
 
 
 
 ).
The interest of this result is that the end-to-end delay bound is not greater than the sum of local delays: 
 
 
 
 .
This result is known as Pay burst only once (PBOO).
