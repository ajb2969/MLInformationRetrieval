   Projective frame      Projective frame   In the mathematical field of projective geometry , a projective frame is an ordered collection of points in projective space which can be used as reference points to describe any other point in that space. For example:   Given three distinct points on a projective line , any other point can be described by its cross-ratio with these three points.  In a projective plane , a projective frame consists of four points, no three of which lie on a projective line.   In general, let K P n denote n -dimensional projective space over an arbitrary field K . This is the projectivization of the vector space K n +1 . Then a projective frame is an ( n +2)- tuple of points in general position in K P n . Here general position means that no subset of n +1 of these points lies in a hyperplane (a projective subspace of dimension n −1).  Sometimes it is convenient to describe a projective frame by n +2 representative vectors v 0 , v 1 , ..., v n +1 in K n+1 . Such a tuple of vectors defines a projective frame if any subset of n +1 of these vectors is a basis for K n +1 . The full set of n +2 vectors must satisfy linear dependence relation         λ  0    v  0    +    λ  1    v  1    +  ⋯  +    λ  n    v  n    +    λ   n  +  1     v   n  +  1      =  0.           subscript  λ  0    subscript  v  0       subscript  λ  1    subscript  v  1    normal-⋯     subscript  λ  n    subscript  v  n       subscript  λ    n  1     subscript  v    n  1      0.    \lambda_{0}v_{0}+\lambda_{1}v_{1}+\cdots+\lambda_{n}v_{n}+\lambda_{n+1}v_{n+1}%
 =0.   However, because the subsets of n +1 vectors are linearly independent, the scalars λ j must all be nonzero. It follows that the representative vectors can be rescaled so that λ j =1 for all j =0,1,..., n +1. This fixes the representative vectors up to an overall scalar multiple. Hence a projective frame is sometimes defined to be a ( n + 2)-tuple of vectors which span K n +1 and sum to zero. Using such a frame, any point p in K P n may be described by a projective version of barycentric coordinates : a collection of n +2 scalars μ j which sum to zero, such that p is represented by the vector         μ  0    v  0    +    μ  1    v  1    +  ⋯  +    μ  n    v  n    +    μ   n  +  1     v   n  +  1      .         subscript  μ  0    subscript  v  0       subscript  μ  1    subscript  v  1    normal-⋯     subscript  μ  n    subscript  v  n       subscript  μ    n  1     subscript  v    n  1       \mu_{0}v_{0}+\mu_{1}v_{1}+\cdots+\mu_{n}v_{n}+\mu_{n+1}v_{n+1}.
