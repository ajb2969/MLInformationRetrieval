Polynucleotide 5'-phosphatase

In enzymology, a polynucleotide 5'-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

a 5'-phosphopolynucleotide + H2O 
 
 
 
  a polynucleotide + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5'-phosphopolynucleotide and H2O, whereas its two products are polynucleotide and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is polynucleotide 5'-phosphohydrolase. This enzyme is also called 5'-polynucleotidase.
