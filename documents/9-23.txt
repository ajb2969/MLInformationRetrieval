Expected shortfall

Expected shortfall (ES) is a risk measure, a concept used in finance (and more specifically in the field of financial risk measurement) to evaluate the market risk or credit risk of a portfolio. It is an alternative to value at risk that is more sensitive to the shape of the loss distribution in the tail of the distribution. The "expected shortfall at q% level" is the expected return on the portfolio in the worst 
 
 
 
 % of the cases.
Expected shortfall is also called conditional value at risk (CVaR), average value at risk (AVaR), and expected tail loss (ETL).
ES evaluates the value (or risk) of an investment in a conservative way, focusing on the less profitable outcomes. For high values of 
 
 
 
  it ignores the most profitable but unlikely possibilities, for small values of 
 
 
 
  it focuses on the worst losses. On the other hand, unlike the discounted maximum loss even for lower values of 
 
 
 
  expected shortfall does not consider only the single most catastrophic outcome. A value of 
 
 
 
  often used in practice is 5%.
Expected shortfall is a coherent, and moreover a spectral, measure of financial portfolio risk. It requires a quantile-level 
 
 
 
 , and is defined to be the expected loss of portfolio value given that a loss is occurring at or below the 
 
 
 
 -quantile.
Formal definition
If 
 
 
 
  (an Lp space) is the payoff of a portfolio at some future time and 
 
 
 
  then we define the expected shortfall as 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Value at risk. This can be equivalently written as 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the lower 
 
 
 
 -quantile and 
 
 
 
  is the indicator function.1 The dual representation is


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the set of probability measures which are absolutely continuous to the physical measure 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
almost surely.2 Note that 
 
 
 
  is the Radon–Nikodym derivative of 
 
 
 
  with respect to 
 
 
 
 .
If the underlying distribution for 
 
 
 
  is a continuous distribution then the expected shortfall is equivalent to the tail conditional expectation defined by 
 
 
 
 .3
Informally, and non rigorously, this equation amounts to saying "in case of losses so severe that they occur only alpha percent of the time, what is our average loss".
Expected shortfall can also be written as a distortion risk measure given by the distortion function

Examples
Example 1. If we believe our average loss on the worst 5% of the possible outcomes for our portfolio is EUR 1000, then we could say our expected shortfall is EUR 1000 for the 5% tail.
Example 2. Consider a portfolio that will have the following possible values at the end of the period:




probability

ending value





of event

of the portfolio



10%

0



30%

80



40%

100



20%

150



Now assume that we paid 100 at the beginning of the period for this portfolio. Then the profit in each case is (ending value−100) or:




probability






of event

profit



10%

−100



30%

−20



40%

0



20%

50



From this table let us calculate the expected shortfall 
 
 
 
  for a few values of 
 
 
 
 :

50%

−32

−26.6



80%

−12.2

To see how these values were calculated, consider the calculation of 
 
 
 
 , the expectation in the worst 5% of cases. These cases belong to (are a subset of) row 1 in the profit table, which have a profit of −100 (total loss of the 100 invested). The expected profit for these cases is −100.
Now consider the calculation of 
 
 
 
 , the expectation in the worst 20 out of 100 cases. These cases are as follows: 10 cases from row one, and 10 cases from row two (note that 10+10 equals the desired 20 cases). For row 1 there is a profit of −100, while for row 2 a profit of −20. Using the expected value formula we get



Similarly for any value of 
 
 
 
 . We select as many rows starting from the top as are necessary to give a cumulative probability of 
 
 
 
  and then calculate an expectation over those cases. In general the last row selected may not be fully used (for example in calculating 
 
 
 
  we used only 10 of the 30 cases per 100 provided by row 2).
As a final example, calculate 
 
 
 
 . This is the expectation over all cases, or

Properties
The expected shortfall 
 
 
 
  increases as 
 
 
 
  increases.
The 100%-quantile expected shortfall 
 
 
 
  equals the expected value of the portfolio.
For a given portfolio, the expected shortfall 
 
 
 
  is greater than or equal to the Value at Risk 
 
 
 
  at the same 
 
 
 
  level.
Dynamic expected shortfall
The conditional version of the expected shortfall at the time t is defined by

This is not a time-consistent risk measure. The time-consistent version is given by
