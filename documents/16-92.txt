(-)-delta-cadinene synthase




(-)-delta-cadinene synthase

(-)-delta-cadinene synthase () is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, (-)-delta-cadinene-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (-)-delta-cadinene + diphosphate


The cyclization mechanism involves an intermediate nerolidyl diphosphate.
