   Jaimovich–Rebelo preferences      Jaimovich–Rebelo preferences   Jaimovich-Rebelo preferences refer to a utility function that allows to parameterize the strength of short-run wealth effects on the labor supply, originally developed by Nir Jaimovich and Sergio Rebelo in their 2009 article Can News about the Future Drive the Business Cycle? 1  Let    C  t     subscript  C  t    C_{t}   denote consumption and let    N  t     subscript  N  t    N_{t}   denote hours worked at period   t   t   t   . The instantaneous utility has the form        u   (   C  t   ,   N  t   )    =      (    C  t   -   ψ   N  t  θ    X  t     )    1  -  σ    -  1    1  -  σ     ,        u    subscript  C  t    subscript  N  t          superscript     subscript  C  t     ψ   superscript   subscript  N  t   θ    subscript  X  t       1  σ    1     1  σ      u\left({C_{t},N_{t}}\right)=\frac{\left(C_{t}-\psi N_{t}^{\theta}X_{t}\right)^%
 {1-\sigma}-1}{1-\sigma},     where        X  t   =    C  t  γ    X   t  -  1    1  -  γ      .       subscript  X  t      superscript   subscript  C  t   γ    superscript   subscript  X    t  1      1  γ       X_{t}=C_{t}^{\gamma}X_{t-1}^{1-\gamma}.     It is assumed that    θ  >  1      θ  1    \theta>1   ,    ψ  >  0      ψ  0    \psi>0   , and    σ  >  0      σ  0    \sigma>0   .  The agents in the model economy maximize their lifetime utility,   U   U   U   , defined over sequences of consumption and hours worked,       U  =    E  0     ∑   t  =  0   ∞     β  t   u   (   C  t   ,   N  t   )       ,      U     subscript  E  0     superscript   subscript     t  0         superscript  β  t   u    subscript  C  t    subscript  N  t         U=E_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\beta^{t}u\left({C_{t},N_{t}}\right),     where    E  0     subscript  E  0    E_{0}   denotes the expectation conditional on the information available at time zero, and the agents internalize the dynamics of    X  t     subscript  X  t    X_{t}   in their maximization problem.  Relationship to other common macroeconomic preference types  Jaimovich-Rebelo preferences nest the KPR preferences and the GHH preferences .  KPR preferences  When    γ  =  1      γ  1    \gamma=1   , the scaling variable    X  t     subscript  X  t    X_{t}   reduces to      X  t   =   C  t    ,       subscript  X  t    subscript  C  t     X_{t}=C_{t},   and the instantaneous utility simplifies to        u   (   C  t   ,   N  t   )    =      (    C  t    (   1  -   ψ   N  t  θ     )    )    1  -  σ    -  1    1  -  σ     ,        u    subscript  C  t    subscript  N  t          superscript     subscript  C  t     1    ψ   superscript   subscript  N  t   θ        1  σ    1     1  σ      u\left({C_{t},N_{t}}\right)=\frac{\left(C_{t}\left(1-\psi N_{t}^{\theta}\right%
 )\right)^{1-\sigma}-1}{1-\sigma},     corresponding to the KPR preferences .  GHH preferences and balanced growth path  When    γ  →  0     normal-→  γ  0    \gamma\rightarrow 0   , and if the economy does not present exogenous growth, then the scaling variable    X  t     subscript  X  t    X_{t}   reduces to a constant      X  t   =  X  >  0   ,         subscript  X  t   X       0     X_{t}=X>0,   and the instantaneous utility simplifies to        u   (   C  t   ,   N  t   )    =      (    C  t   -   ψ  X   N  t  θ     )    1  -  σ    -  1    1  -  σ     ,        u    subscript  C  t    subscript  N  t          superscript     subscript  C  t     ψ  X   superscript   subscript  N  t   θ       1  σ    1     1  σ      u\left({C_{t},N_{t}}\right)=\frac{\left(C_{t}-\psi XN_{t}^{\theta}\right)^{1-%
 \sigma}-1}{1-\sigma},     corresponding to the original GHH preferences , in which the wealth effect on the labor supply is completely shut off.  Note however that the original GHH preferences are not compatible with a balanced growth path , while the Jaimovich-Rebelo preferences are compatible with a balanced growth path for    0  <  γ  ≤  1        0  γ       1     0<\gamma\leq 1   . To reconcile these facts, first note that the Jaimovich-Rebelo preferences are compatible with a balanced growth path for    0  <  γ  ≤  1        0  γ       1     0<\gamma\leq 1   because the scaling variable,    X  t     subscript  X  t    X_{t}   , grows at the same rate as the labor augmenting technology.  Let    z  t     subscript  z  t    z_{t}   denote the level of labor augmenting technology. Then, in a balanced growth path, consumption    C  t     subscript  C  t    C_{t}   and the scaling variable    X  t     subscript  X  t    X_{t}   grow at the same rate as    z  t     subscript  z  t    z_{t}   . When    γ  →  0     normal-→  γ  0    \gamma\rightarrow 0   , the stationary variable     X  t    z  t        subscript  X  t    subscript  z  t     \frac{X_{t}}{z_{t}}   satisfies the relation         X  t    z  t    =     X   t  -  1     z   t  -  1       z   t  -  1     z  t      ,         subscript  X  t    subscript  z  t         subscript  X    t  1     subscript  z    t  1        subscript  z    t  1     subscript  z  t       \frac{X_{t}}{z_{t}}=\frac{X_{t-1}}{z_{t-1}}\frac{z_{t-1}}{z_{t}},     which implies that        X  t   =   X   z  t     ,       subscript  X  t     X   subscript  z  t      X_{t}=Xz_{t},     for some constant    X  >  0      X  0    X>0   .  Then, the instantaneous utility simplifies to        u   (   C  t   ,   N  t   )    =      (    C  t   -    z  t   ψ  X   N  t  θ     )    1  -  σ    -  1    1  -  σ     ,        u    subscript  C  t    subscript  N  t          superscript     subscript  C  t      subscript  z  t   ψ  X   superscript   subscript  N  t   θ       1  σ    1     1  σ      u\left({C_{t},N_{t}}\right)=\frac{\left(C_{t}-z_{t}\psi XN_{t}^{\theta}\right)%
 ^{1-\sigma}-1}{1-\sigma},     consistent with the shortcut of introducing a scaling factor containing the level of labor augmenting technology before the hours worked term.  References  "  Category:Macroeconomics     ↩
