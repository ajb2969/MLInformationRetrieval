   Atiyah–Segal completion theorem      Atiyah–Segal completion theorem   The Atiyah–Segal completion theorem is a theorem in mathematics about equivariant  K-theory in homotopy theory . Let G be a compact  Lie group and let X be a G - CW-complex . The theorem then states that the projection map      π  :     X  ×  E   G   →  X      normal-:  π   normal-→      X  E   G   X     \pi\colon X\times EG\to X     induces an isomorphism of prorings       π  *   :     K  G  *    (  X  )      I   ^    →    K  G  *    (    X  ×  E   G   )        normal-:   superscript  π     normal-→     superscript   subscript  K  G     X   normal-^   I        superscript   subscript  K  G         X  E   G       \pi^{*}\colon K_{G}^{*}(X)\hat{{}_{I}}\to K_{G}^{*}(X\times EG)   .  Here, the induced map has as domain the completion of the G -equivariant K-theory of X with respect to I , where I denotes the augmentation ideal of the representation ring of G .  In the special case of X a point, the theorem specializes to give an isomorphism      K  *    (   B  G   )    ≅   R   (  G  )      I   ^           superscript  K      B  G      R  G   normal-^   I       K^{*}(BG)\cong R(G)\hat{{}_{I}}   between the K-theory of the classifying space of G and the completion of the representation ring.  The theorem can be interpreted as giving a comparison between the geometrical process of completing a G -space by making the action free and the algebraic process of completing with respect to an ideal. 1  The theorem was first proved for finite groups by Michael Atiyah in 1961, 2 and a proof of the general case was published by Atiyah together with Graeme Segal in 1969. 3 Different proofs have since appeared generalizing the theorem to completion with respect to families of subgroups. 4  5 The corresponding statement for algebraic K-theory was proven by Merkujev, holding in the case that the group is algebraic over the complex numbers.
