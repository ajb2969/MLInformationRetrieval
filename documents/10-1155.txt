CEILIDH


For the social dance, see Céilidh

CEILIDH is a public key cryptosystem based on the discrete logarithm problem in algebraic torus. This idea was first introduced by Alice Silverberg and Karl Rubin in 2003. The main advantage of the system is the reduced size of the keys for the same security over basic schemes.
The name CEILIDH comes from the Scots Gaelic word ceilidh which means a traditional Scottish Gathering.
Algorithms
Parameters

Let 
 
 
 
  be a prime power.
An integer

 
  is chosen such that :
 
The torus 
 
 
 
  has an explicit rational parametrization.


 
  is divisible by a big prime 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
Cyclotomic polynomial.

Let 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Euler function.
Let 
 
 
 
  a birational map and its inverse

Choose

Key agreement scheme
This Scheme is based on the Diffie-Hellman key agreement.

Alice chooses a random number 
 
 
 
 .
She computes 
 
 
 
  and sends it to Bob.


Bob chooses a random number 
 
 
 
 .
He computes 
 
 
 
  and sends it to Alice.


Alice computes 
 
 

Bob computes 
 
 




 
  is the identity, thus we have : 
 
 
 
  which is the shared secret of Alice and Bob.
Encryption scheme
This scheme is based on the ElGamal encryption.

Key Generation

Alice chooses a random number 
 
 
 
  as her private key.
The resulting public key is 
 
 
 
 .



Encryption

The message 
 
 
 
  is an element of 
 
 
 
 .
Bob chooses a random integer 
 
 
 
  in the range 
 
 
 
 .
Bob computes 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Bob sends the ciphertext 
 
 
 
  to Alice.



Decryption

Alice computes 
 
 
 
 .


Security
The CEILIDH scheme is based on the ElGamal scheme and thus has similar security properties.
If the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption holds the underlying cyclic group 
 
 
 
 , then the encryption function is one-way.1
If the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption (DDH) holds in 
 
 
 
 , then CEILIDH achieves semantic security.2 Semantic security is not implied by the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption alone.3 See decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption for a discussion of groups where the assumption is believed to hold.
CEILIDH encryption is unconditionally malleable, and therefore is not secure under chosen ciphertext attack. For example, given an encryption 
 
 
 
  of some (possibly unknown) message 
 
 
 
 , one can easily construct a valid encryption 
 
 
 
  of the message 
 
 
 
 .
