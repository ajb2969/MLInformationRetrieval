   Lebesgue's density theorem      Lebesgue's density theorem   In mathematics , Lebesgue's density theorem states that for any Lebesgue measurable set     A  ⊂    \R   n       A   superscript  \R  n     A\subset\R^{n}   , the "density" of A is 0 or 1 at almost every point in     \R   n     superscript  \R  n    \R^{n}   . Additionally, the "density" of A is 1 at almost every point in A . Intuitively, this means that the "edge" of A , the set of points in A whose "neighborhood" is partially in A and partially outside of A , is negligible .  Let μ be the Lebesgue measure on the Euclidean space  R n and A be a Lebesgue measurable subset of R n . Define the approximate density of A in a ε-neighborhood of a point x in R n as        d  ε    (  x  )    =    μ   (   A  ∩    B  ε    (  x  )     )     μ   (    B  ε    (  x  )    )            subscript  d  ε   x       μ    A     subscript  B  ε   x       μ     subscript  B  ε   x       d_{\varepsilon}(x)=\frac{\mu(A\cap B_{\varepsilon}(x))}{\mu(B_{\varepsilon}(x))}     where B ε denotes the closed ball of radius ε centered at x .  Lebesgue's density theorem asserts that for almost every point x of A the density       d   (  x  )    =    lim   ε  →  0      d  ε    (  x  )           d  x     subscript    normal-→  ε  0       subscript  d  ε   x      d(x)=\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}d_{\varepsilon}(x)     exists and is equal to 1.  In other words, for every measurable set A , the density of A is 0 or 1 almost everywhere in R n . 1 However, it is a curious fact that if μ( A ) > 0 and , then there are always points of R n where the density is neither 0 nor 1.  For example, given a square in the plane, the density at every point inside the square is 1, on the edges is 1/2, and at the corners is 1/4. The set of points in the plane at which the density is neither 0 nor 1 is non-empty (the square boundary), but it is negligible.  The Lebesgue density theorem is a particular case of the Lebesgue differentiation theorem .  Thus, this theorem is also true for every finite Borel measure on R n instead of Lebesgue measure, see Discussion .  See also   Lebesgue differentiation theorem .   References   Hallard T. Croft.
