   Rectifiable set      Rectifiable set   In mathematics , a rectifiable set is a set that is smooth in a certain measure-theoretic sense. It is an extension of the idea of a rectifiable curve to higher dimensions; loosely speaking, a rectifiable set is a rigorous formulation of a piece-wise smooth set. As such, it has many of the desirable properties of smooth manifolds , including tangent spaces that are defined almost everywhere . Rectifiable sets are the underlying object of study in geometric measure theory .  Definition  A subset   E   E   E   of Euclidean space     ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   is said to be    m   m   m   -rectifiable set if there exist a countable collection    {   f  i   }      subscript  f  i     \{f_{i}\}   of continuously differentiable maps       f  i   :    ℝ  m   →   ℝ  n       normal-:   subscript  f  i    normal-→   superscript  ℝ  m    superscript  ℝ  n      f_{i}:\mathbb{R}^{m}\to\mathbb{R}^{n}     such that the   m   m   m   - Hausdorff measure     ℋ  m     superscript  ℋ  m    \mathcal{H}^{m}   of      E  \    ⋃   i  =  0   ∞     f  i    (   ℝ  m   )        normal-\  E    superscript   subscript     i  0         subscript  f  i    superscript  ℝ  m       E\backslash\bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty}f_{i}\left(\mathbb{R}^{m}\right)     is zero. The backslash here denotes the set difference . Equivalently, the    f  i     subscript  f  i    f_{i}   may be taken to be Lipschitz continuous without altering the definition. 1  A set   E   E   E   is said to be purely   m   m   m   -unrectifiable if for every (continuous, differentiable)    f  :    ℝ  m   →   ℝ  n       normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  ℝ  m    superscript  ℝ  n      f:\mathbb{R}^{m}\to\mathbb{R}^{n}   , one has        ℋ  m    (   E  ∩   f   (   ℝ  m   )     )    =  0.         superscript  ℋ  m     E    f   superscript  ℝ  m      0.    \mathcal{H}^{m}\left(E\cap f\left(\mathbb{R}^{m}\right)\right)=0.     A standard example of a purely-1-unrectifiable set in two dimensions is the cross-product of the Smith-Volterra-Cantor set times itself.  Rectifiable sets in metric spaces  gives the following terminology for m -rectifiable sets E in a general metric space X .   E is    m   m   m   rectifiable when there exists a Lipschitz bijection    f  :   K  →  E      normal-:  f   normal-→  K  E     f:K\to E   for some bounded subset   K   K   K   of    ℝ  m     superscript  ℝ  m    \mathbb{R}^{m}   .  E is countably   m   m   m   rectifiable when E equals the union of a countable family of   m   m   m   rectifiable sets.  E is countably    (  ϕ  ,  m  )     ϕ  m    (\phi,m)   rectifiable when   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is a measure on X and there is a countably   m   m   m   rectifiable set F such that     ϕ   (   E  ∖  F   )    =  0        ϕ    E  F    0    \phi(E\setminus F)=0   .  E is     (  ϕ  ,  m  )     ϕ  m    (\phi,m)   rectifiable when E is countably    (  ϕ  ,  m  )     ϕ  m    (\phi,m)   rectifiable and     ϕ   (  E  )    <  ∞        ϕ  E      \phi(E)<\infty     E is purely    (  ϕ  ,  m  )     ϕ  m    (\phi,m)   unrectifiable when   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is a measure on X and E includes no   m   m   m   rectifiable set F with     ϕ   (  F  )    >  0        ϕ  F   0    \phi(F)>0   .   Definition 3 with    ϕ  =   ℋ  m       ϕ   superscript  ℋ  m     \phi=\mathcal{H}^{m}   and    X  =   ℝ  n       X   superscript  ℝ  n     X=\mathbb{R}^{n}   comes closest to the above definition for subsets of Euclidean spaces.
