   Universal coefficient theorem      Universal coefficient theorem   In algebraic topology , universal coefficient theorems establish relationships between homology and cohomology theories. For instance, the integral homology theory of a topological space    X   X   X   , and its homology with coefficients in any abelian group    A   A   A   are related as follows: the integral homology groups      completely determine the groups      Here might be the simplicial homology or more general singular homology theory: the result itself is a pure piece of homological algebra about chain complexes of free abelian groups . The form of the result is that other coefficients   A   A   A   may be used, at the cost of using a Tor functor .  For example it is common to take   A   A   A   to be     𝐙  /  2   𝐙        𝐙  2   𝐙    \mathbf{Z}/2\mathbf{Z}   , so that coefficients are modulo 2. This becomes straightforward in the absence of 2- torsion in the homology. Quite generally, the result indicates the relationship that holds between the Betti numbers  of   X   X   X   and the Betti numbers with coefficients in a field    F   F   F   . These can differ, but only when the characteristic of   F   F   F   is a prime number    p   p   p   for which there is some   p   p   p   -torsion in the homology.  Statement of the homology case  Consider the tensor product of modules  . The theorem states there is a short exact sequence      0  →      H  i    (  X  ;  𝐙  )    ⊗  A    →  𝜇    H  i    (  X  ;  A  )    →   Tor   (    H   i  -  1     (  X  ;  𝐙  )    ,  A  )    →  0.       normal-→  0     tensor-product     subscript  H  i    X  𝐙    A    μ  normal-→    subscript  H  i    X  A      normal-→      Tor      subscript  H    i  1     X  𝐙    A      normal-→    0.     0\to H_{i}(X;\mathbf{Z})\otimes A\overset{\mu}{\to}H_{i}(X;A)\to\mbox{Tor}(H_{%
 i-1}(X;\mathbf{Z}),A)\to 0.     Furthermore, this sequence splits , though not naturally. Here   μ   μ   μ   is a map induced by the bilinear map .  If the coefficient ring   A   A   A   is     𝐙  /  p   𝐙        𝐙  p   𝐙    \mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z}   , this is a special case of the Bockstein spectral sequence .  Universal coefficient theorem for cohomology  Let   G   G   G   be a module over a principal ideal domain   R   R   R   (e.g.,   𝐙   𝐙   \mathbf{Z}   or a field.)  There is also a universal coefficient theorem for cohomology involving the Ext functor , which asserts that there is a natural short exact sequence      0  →    Ext  R  1    (    H   i  -  1     (  X  ;  R  )    ,  G  )    →    H  i    (  X  ;  G  )    →  ℎ     Hom  R    (    H  i    (  X  ;  R  )    ,  G  )     →  0.       normal-→  0    superscript   subscript  Ext  R   1     subscript  normal-H    i  1    X  R   G     normal-→       superscript  H  i    X  G    h  normal-→     subscript  Hom  R      subscript  H  i    X  R    G      normal-→    0.     0\to\operatorname{Ext}_{R}^{1}(\operatorname{H}_{i-1}(X;R),G)\to H^{i}(X;G)%
 \overset{h}{\to}\operatorname{Hom}_{R}(H_{i}(X;R),G)\to 0.     As in the homology case, the sequence splits, though not naturally.  In fact, suppose        H  i    (  X  ;  G  )    =      ker   ∂  i    ⊗  G   /   im   ∂   i  +  1      ⊗  G          subscript  H  i    X  G     tensor-product     tensor-product    kernel   subscript   i    G    im   subscript     i  1      G     H_{i}(X;G)=\ker\partial_{i}\otimes G/\operatorname{im}\partial_{i+1}\otimes G     and define:         H  *    (  X  ;  G  )    =    ker   (   Hom   (  ∂  ,  G  )    )    /   im   (   Hom   (  ∂  ,  G  )    )      .         superscript  H     X  G       kernel   Hom   G     im   Hom   G       H^{*}(X;G)=\ker(\operatorname{Hom}(\partial,G))/\operatorname{im}(%
 \operatorname{Hom}(\partial,G)).     Then   h   h   h   above is the canonical map:        h   (   [  f  ]   )    (   [  x  ]   )    =   f   (  x  )     .        h   delimited-[]  f    delimited-[]  x      f  x     h([f])([x])=f(x).     An alternative point-of-view can be based on representing cohomology via Eilenberg-MacLane space where the map   h   h   h   takes a homotopy class of maps from   X   X   X   to    K   (  G  ,  i  )       K   G  i     K(G,i)   to the corresponding homomorphism induced in homology. Thus, the Eilenberg-MacLane space is a weak right adjoint to the homology functor . 1  Example: mod 2 cohomology of the real projective space  Let  P n ( R )}} , the real projective space . We compute the singular cohomology of   X   X   X   with coefficients in    R  =    𝐙  /  2   𝐙       R      𝐙  2   𝐙     R=\mathbf{Z}/2\mathbf{Z}   .  Knowing that the integer homology is given by:        E  x  t   (  R  ,  R  )    =  R   ,    E  x  t   (  𝐙  ,  R  )    =  0      formulae-sequence      E  x  t   R  R    R       E  x  t   𝐙  R    0     Ext(R,R)=R,Ext(\mathbf{Z},R)=0     In fact the total cohomology ring structure is     X   X   X     Corollaries  A special case of the theorem is computing integral cohomology. For a finite CW complex       H  i    (  X  ;  𝐙  )    ≅    𝐙    β  i    (  X  )     ⊕   T  i     ,         subscript  H  i    X  𝐙     direct-sum   superscript  𝐙     subscript  β  i   X     subscript  T  i      H_{i}(X;\mathbf{Z})\cong\mathbf{Z}^{\beta_{i}(X)}\oplus T_{i},   , is finitely generated, and so we have the following decomposition .     X   X   X     where are the betti numbers of    T  i     subscript  T  i    T_{i}   and    H  i     subscript  H  i    H_{i}   is the torsion part of      Hom   (    H  i    (  X  )    ,  𝐙  )    ≅    Hom   (   𝐙    β  i    (  X  )     ,  𝐙  )    ⊕   Hom   (   T  i   ,  𝐙  )     ≅   𝐙    β  i    (  X  )      ,          Hom      subscript  H  i   X   𝐙     direct-sum    Hom    superscript  𝐙     subscript  β  i   X    𝐙      Hom    subscript  T  i   𝐙           superscript  𝐙     subscript  β  i   X       \mbox{Hom}(H_{i}(X),\mathbf{Z})\cong\mbox{Hom}(\mathbf{Z}^{\beta_{i}(X)},%
 \mathbf{Z})\oplus\mbox{Hom}(T_{i},\mathbf{Z})\cong\mathbf{Z}^{\beta_{i}(X)},   . One may check that        Ext   (    H  i    (  X  )    ,  𝐙  )    ≅    Ext   (   𝐙    β  i    (  X  )     ,  𝐙  )    ⊕   Ext   (   T  i   ,  𝐙  )     ≅   T  i    .          Ext      subscript  H  i   X   𝐙     direct-sum    Ext    superscript  𝐙     subscript  β  i   X    𝐙      Ext    subscript  T  i   𝐙           subscript  T  i      \mbox{Ext}(H_{i}(X),\mathbf{Z})\cong\mbox{Ext}(\mathbf{Z}^{\beta_{i}(X)},%
 \mathbf{Z})\oplus\mbox{Ext}(T_{i},\mathbf{Z})\cong T_{i}.     and         H  i    (  X  ;  𝐙  )    ≅    𝐙    β  i    (  X  )     ⊕   T   i  -  1      .         superscript  H  i    X  𝐙     direct-sum   superscript  𝐙     subscript  β  i   X     subscript  T    i  1       H^{i}(X;\mathbf{Z})\cong\mathbf{Z}^{\beta_{i}(X)}\oplus T_{i-1}.     This gives the following statement for integral cohomology:     X   X   X     For   n   n   n   an orientable , closed , and connected  $n$ - manifold , this corollary coupled with Poincaré duality gives that  β n − i ( X )}} .
