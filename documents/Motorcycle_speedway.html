<h1>Motorcycle speedway</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Motorcycle speedway</strong>, usually referred to as <strong>speedway</strong>, is a <a href="motorcycle_sport" title="wikilink">motorcycle sport</a> involving four and sometimes up to six riders competing over four <a href="clockwise" title="wikilink">anti-clockwise</a> laps of an oval circuit. Speedway <a href="motorcycle" title="wikilink">motorcycles</a> use only one <a class="uri" href="gear" title="wikilink">gear</a> and have no <a href="brake" title="wikilink">brakes</a>; racing takes place on a flat oval track usually consisting of <a href="soil" title="wikilink">dirt</a>, loosely packed <a class="uri" href="shale" title="wikilink">shale</a>, or <a class="uri" href="dolomite" title="wikilink">dolomite</a> (mostly used in Australia and New Zealand). Competitors use this surface to slide their machines sideways, <a class="uri" href="powersliding" title="wikilink">powersliding</a> or <a class="uri" href="broadsiding" title="wikilink">broadsiding</a> into the bends. On the straight sections of the track the motorcycles reach speeds of up .</p>

<p>The exact origins of the sport are unknown but there is evidence of a type of speedway racing being practised in the USA before the <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">First World War</a> and in Australia in the late 1910s and early 1920s. There are now both domestic and international competitions in a number of countries including the <a href="Speedway_World_Cup" title="wikilink">Speedway World Cup</a> whilst the highest overall scoring individual in the <a href="Speedway_Grand_Prix" title="wikilink">Speedway Grand Prix</a> events is pronounced the world champion. Speedway is popular in <a href="Central_Europe" title="wikilink">central</a> and <a href="northern_Europe" title="wikilink">northern Europe</a> and to a lesser extent in Australia and North America. A variant of <a href="track_racing" title="wikilink">track racing</a>, speedway is administered internationally by the <a href="Fédération_Internationale_de_Motocyclisme" title="wikilink">Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme</a> (FIM). Domestic speedway events are regulated by FIM affiliated national <a href="List_of_FIM_affiliated_federations" title="wikilink">motor sport federations</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p> The early history of speedway race meetings is a subject of much debate and controversy. There is evidence to show that meetings were held on small dirt tracks in Australia and the United States before <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>. An American rider named Don Johns was known to have used <a class="uri" href="broadsiding" title="wikilink">broadsiding</a> before 1914. It was said that he would ride the entire race course wide open, throwing great showers of dirt into the air at each turn.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> By the early 1920s, Johns' style of cornering was followed in the US – where the sport was initially called "Short Track Racing" – by riders such as Albert "Shrimp" Burns, Maldwyn Jones and Eddie Brinck.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Consequently, two long-hold and common beliefs are incorrect: first, that New Zealand-born rider <a href="Johnnie_Hoskins" title="wikilink">Johnnie Hoskins</a> invented the sport, and second, that the first meeting was held on 15 December 1923 at <a href="West_Maitland_Showground" title="wikilink">West Maitland Showground</a>, in the <a href="Hunter_Region" title="wikilink">Hunter Region</a> of <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a>, Australia. For instance, a contemporary newspaper report of this meeting, in the <em><a href="Maitland_Mercury" title="wikilink">Maitland Mercury</a></em>, mentions previous meetings.</p>

<p>The first meeting in the United Kingdom took place at <a href="High_Beach" title="wikilink">High Beech</a> on 19 February 1928.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> There are, however, claims that meetings were held in 1927 at <a class="uri" href="Camberley" title="wikilink">Camberley</a>, <a class="uri" href="Surrey" title="wikilink">Surrey</a> and <a class="uri" href="Droylsden" title="wikilink">Droylsden</a>, <a class="uri" href="Lancashire" title="wikilink">Lancashire</a>. Despite being described as "the first British Dirt Track meeting" at the time, the meeting at Camberley on 7 May 1927 differed in that the races were held in a <a class="uri" href="clockwise" title="wikilink">clockwise</a> direction.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Races at Droylsden were held in an <a class="uri" href="anti-clockwise" title="wikilink">anti-clockwise</a> direction but it is generally accepted that the sport arrived in the United Kingdom when Australians Billy Galloway and Keith McKay arrived with the intention of introducing speedway to the <a href="Northern_Hemisphere" title="wikilink">Northern Hemisphere</a>. Both featured in the 1928 High Beech meeting. The first speedway meeting in the UK to feature bikes with no brakes and <a class="uri" href="broadsiding" title="wikilink">broadsiding</a> round corners on loose dirt was the third meeting held at High Beech on 9 April 1928, where <a href="Colin_Watson_(speedway_rider)" title="wikilink">Colin Watson</a>, Alf Medcalf and "Digger" Pugh demonstrated the art for the first time in the UK. Proto speedway was staged in Glasgow at the Olympic Stadium (Glasgow Nelson) on April 9, 1928 and the first fully professional meeting was staged at Celtic Park on April 28, 1928. The first meeting in Wales was staged at Cardiff White City on Boxing Day 1928.</p>

<p>In the 1928/29 season at the <a href="Melbourne_Museum" title="wikilink">Melbourne Exhibition Speedway</a>, Australian Colin Stewart won the prestigious Silver Gauntlet, which required the rider to win the feature race 10 times in one season. He won it 12 times. He also achieved success at an international level, racing for <a href="Southampton_Saints" title="wikilink">Southampton Saints</a> in 1929 and captained Glasgow in the Northern League in 1930 before moving to <a href="Wembley_Lions_(speedway)" title="wikilink">Wembley Lions</a> in 1931, for whom he rode in just four matches, averaging 4.00 points per match. He also raced in the 1930 Scottish Championship which was won by Wembley Lions' <a href="Harry_Whitfield" title="wikilink">Harry Whitfield</a>.</p>

<p>The forerunner of the World Championship, the <a href="Star_Riders'_Championship" title="wikilink">Star Riders' Championship</a>, was inaugurated in Great Britain in 1929 but was split into two sections as it was felt that the British riders were not yet the equal of the Australians and Americans. <a href="Frank_Arthur" title="wikilink">Frank Arthur</a> won the Overseas Section and <a href="Roger_Frogley" title="wikilink">Roger Frogley</a> the British. The following year the two sections were amalgamated and <a href="Vic_Huxley" title="wikilink">Vic Huxley</a> proved to be the winner.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Huxley was also runner-up three times and won the first British Match Race championship in 1931.</p>

<p>Speedway racing typically took place on purpose built tracks, although in Australia bikes shared larger Speedways with cars such as <a href="Sprint_car_racing" title="wikilink">Sprintcars</a>, <a href="Midget_car_racing" title="wikilink">Speedcars</a> (Midgets) and Saloons, with tracks traditionally ranging from ⅓ Mile Showground tracks, such as the now closed  <a href="Claremont_Speedway" title="wikilink">Claremont Speedway</a> in <a class="uri" href="Perth" title="wikilink">Perth</a> and the  <a href="Sydney_Showground_Speedway" title="wikilink">Sydney Showground</a>, to smaller, purpose built  long motorcycle tracks, such as <a href="Gillman_Speedway" title="wikilink">Gillman Speedway</a> in <a class="uri" href="Adelaide" title="wikilink">Adelaide</a> and <a class="uri" href="Mildura" title="wikilink">Mildura</a>'s <a href="Olympic_Park_Speedway_(Mildura)" title="wikilink">Olympic Park</a>.</p>
<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>

<p> Each track is between 260 to 425 metres long and it takes approximately one minute to complete four laps. For example, 10 time <a href="Australian_Individual_Speedway_Championship" title="wikilink">Australian Champion</a> <a href="Leigh_Adams" title="wikilink">Leigh Adams</a> set a record time of 59 seconds on a  track and produced an average speed of 83 km/h (49 mph). The speed on straight sections of the track reaches 110 km/h (70 mph) or more on longer tracks, but the limited speed on curves lowers the average.</p>

<p>At the start of a race it takes between one and two seconds for the motorcycle to reach the "curve speed" (somewhat lower than the average), which is roughly estimated to be the equivalent of 2.5 to 3 seconds to reach  (or <a href="0_to_60_mph" title="wikilink">0 to 60 mph</a>). The start of the race is an important aspect of the race overall. "Gating" correctly can help a rider gain an initial advantage over other riders but speed advantages can be made as a race progresses. Those riders willing to take a risk and opt for finding the grippy parts of the track rather than the race line, are sometimes rewarded with extra speed allowing them to pass other riders either on the outside or the inside.</p>
<h2 id="track">Track</h2>

<p>  Tracks used for professional speedway racing are regulated by the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) who provide rules concerning construction, size and safety requirements.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Speedway racing takes place on a level oval track consisting of two straights joined by two semicircles. Tracks must be between 260 to 425 metres (850 and 1500 ft) in length, this is measured at a distance of  from the inner boundary. Tracks may be banked, but the gradient must under no circumstances exceed 5% in the straight, 10% in the bends, and must remain constant and grow from the inner edge to the safety fence. A white start line is marked across the track approximately mid-way along one of the straights. The starting area is also divided into four equal parts (known as gates) by white lines marked at right angles to the start line and extending back at least . Additional rules govern the placement of warning systems such as lights and also the construction of the starting mechanism. The minimum track width is  on the straights and the bends must be at least  wide. The minimum widths give each rider adequate space to safely navigate the track. The start line and starting gate assembly is halfway along one of the two straight sections of the track. Starting gates are simple <a href="Spring_(device)" title="wikilink">spring-loaded</a> mechanisms that raise two or three strands of tape to start the race.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>The FIM regulations require licensed tracks to provide a garage or pit area for motorcycles as well as medical and press facilities. Track boundaries are marked by white lines or barriers on the inside and outside of the track, any rider who crosses this boundary with both wheels will be disqualified unless they only did so in the interest of safety or were forced to by another competitor.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

</figure>

<p>The track surface consists of four layers of <a href="Land_grading" title="wikilink">grading</a>. The topmost of which must be of <a class="uri" href="shale" title="wikilink">shale</a>, <a class="uri" href="granite" title="wikilink">granite</a>, <a class="uri" href="brick" title="wikilink">brick</a> granules or other loose material of which no individual piece can be over  in size. Competitors use this surface to slide their machines sideways (powersliding or <a class="uri" href="broadsiding" title="wikilink">broadsiding</a>) into the bends using the rear wheel to scrub-off speed while still providing the drive to power the bike forward and around the bend. The skill of speedway lies in the overall ability of the rider to control his motorcycle when cornering and thus avoid losing places through <a class="uri" href="deceleration" title="wikilink">deceleration</a>. The use of <a href="asphalt_concrete" title="wikilink">asphalt</a>, <a class="uri" href="concrete" title="wikilink">concrete</a> and <a class="uri" href="tarmac" title="wikilink">tarmac</a> for any layer is prohibited. The top layer must be levelled or "graded" at intervals during an event by tractors towing specially adapted rakes to evenly re-distribute the surface. Tracks are watered before and, if needed, during meetings to prevent the surface becoming too dry and to protect the public and the riders from dust.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>

</figure>

<p>Safety requirements include the use of suspended wire fences, air fences and wooden fences. Air fences are made up of inflated panels installed on the bends. The fence is designed to dissipate energy by allowing an impacted area to compress and transfer air into the rest of the fence through blow-off valves or restriction ports connected to the other sections.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> They are mandatory for tracks in the <a href="Elite_League_(speedway)" title="wikilink">British Elite League</a>, <a href="Speedway_Ekstraliga" title="wikilink">Polish Ekstraliga</a>, <a href="Speedway_Grand_Prix" title="wikilink">Speedway Grand Prix</a> and <a href="Speedway_World_Cup" title="wikilink">Speedway World Cup</a>. Neutral zones outside the track provide safe run-off areas for riders and their machinery to minimise the potential risk of injury to spectators.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The majority of tracks are dedicated to speedway or other sports such as <a href="sidecar_speedway" title="wikilink">sidecar speedway</a> and <a href="banger_racing" title="wikilink">banger racing</a>. For larger events, the FIM occasionally sanctions the use of stadiums that install temporary tracks such as the <a href="Speedway_Grand_Prix_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">British Grand Prix</a> held at the <a href="Millennium_Stadium" title="wikilink">Millennium Stadium</a> in <a class="uri" href="Cardiff" title="wikilink">Cardiff</a>.</p>
<h2 id="motorcycles">Motorcycles</h2>

<p> Speedway uses a unique type of motorcycle, governed by the FIM's "Track Racing Technical Rules".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In the past, bikes with upright engines were used (the name taken from the way the engine sits in the frame), but today most professional riders use laydown bikes as it is argued that they are easier to handle. As speedway bikes do not use <a href="brake" title="wikilink">brakes</a>, the <a href="Clutch#Clutch_operation_in_motorcycles" title="wikilink">clutch</a> is used as a release mechanism at the start of races. FIM regulations state that the motorcycles must have no <a href="brake" title="wikilink">brakes</a>, are powered by pure <a href="Methanol_fuel" title="wikilink">methanol</a>, use only one <a class="uri" href="gear" title="wikilink">gear</a> and weigh a minimum of . By using engine and rear wheel <a href="sprocket" title="wikilink">sprockets</a> the <a href="gear_ratio" title="wikilink">gear ratio</a> can be adjusted as required for track conditions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The use of methanol allows for an increased <a href="compression_ratio" title="wikilink">compression ratio</a> to the engine producing more power than other fuels and resulting in higher speeds (approximately  when cornering).</p>

<p> Machines used must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weigh no less than 77 kg (unfuelled)</li>
<li>Use a <a href="Four-stroke_engine" title="wikilink">four-stroke</a>, <a href="single-cylinder_engine" title="wikilink">single-cylinder engine</a> with one <a class="uri" href="carburettor" title="wikilink">carburettor</a> and one <a href="spark_plug" title="wikilink">spark plug</a> and a maximum capacity of 500<a href="Cubic_centimetre" title="wikilink">cc</a></li>
<li>Have guards fitted over moving engine parts where reasonable</li>
<li>Use an additional chain guard to prevent a hand or fingers being cut at the nip point where the chain meets the sprocket by a <a href="roller_chain" title="wikilink">chain</a></li>
<li>Have a peg (Dutch Peg) fitted to prevent a broken primary chain flailing and injuring a rider or a fellow competitor</li>
<li>Use shatter resistant plastics where reasonable</li>
<li>Be fitted with a dirt deflector</li>
<li>Be fuelled by <a class="uri" href="methanol" title="wikilink">methanol</a> with no additives</li>
<li>Be fitted with an approved <a href="Muffler" title="wikilink">silencer</a></li>
<li>Have a handlebar width greater than 650 mm and less than 850 mm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Machines used cannot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be constructed in any part from <a class="uri" href="Titanium" title="wikilink">Titanium</a></li>
<li>Use uncoated <a class="uri" href="ceramic" title="wikilink">ceramic</a> parts</li>
<li>Use <a href="Telemetry#Motor_racing" title="wikilink">telemetry</a> during a race except for timing purposes</li>
<li>Use any electronic components to control the engine</li>
<li>Use <a href="brake" title="wikilink">brakes</a> of any form</li>
<li>Use <a class="uri" href="supercharger" title="wikilink">supercharger</a> or a <a class="uri" href="turbocharger" title="wikilink">turbocharger</a> of any kind.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition all motorcycles must have a safety cut out device fitted, this is defined as a switch that "must cut off the circuit of the electrical supply by the simple action of pulling a lanyard or a non-elastic string (with a maximum length of ) attached to the rider's right wrist."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The high <a href="compression_ratio" title="wikilink">compression ratio</a> of the engine can also assist in slowing down a machine; if the <a class="uri" href="throttle" title="wikilink">throttle</a> is closed the engine may stop. Riders can stop the bike by deliberately laying down the bike on the track and this technique is used to avoid riders who fall in front of a pursuing colleague. Before cut outs were fitted an engine was stopped in an emergency situation by removing the plug lead from the <a href="spark_plug" title="wikilink">spark plug</a> or shutting off the fuel supply.</p>
<h2 id="racing">Racing</h2>

<p>  Races (known as heats) consist of four riders racing over four laps from a <a href="standing_start" title="wikilink">standing start</a>. Riders wear different coloured helmets, traditionally in team events red and blue denote home team riders, and white and yellow/black quartered colours (latterly plain yellow) denote visiting riders. The starting area is divided into a grid of four equal parts and the riders from each team must take their place in alternate grids or "gates". The colours also denote starting positions in individual events; Red is the inside gate (gate 1), blue starts from gate 2, white starts from gate 3 and yellow/black starts on the outside (gate 4). Riders must be able to get their bikes to the start line under their own power, without any external assistance and not by pushing the machine, then line up in parallel.</p>

<p>A rider who is not at the start line within a reasonable period of time is also liable to be disqualified, although league matches in the UK allow teams to elect to start the disqualified rider fifteen metres back from the tapes or replace the disqualified rider with a team reserve. This period of time is standardised to two minutes from a time determined by the match referee and usually indicated by a bell, a rotating orange lamp or a digital clock readout. All riders must be at the tapes under their own power before the two minutes have elapsed. Additional time between races will be allowed by, and at the discretion of, the referee if a rider has two consecutive rides, to allow the rider time to prepare.</p>

<p>A starting gate consisting of two or more tapes is erected across the start line. The riders must situate themselves not more than  from this and not touch it once the green light comes on, they must also remain stationary until the tapes are raised. Failure to do so is known as a <em>tape infringement</em> and can result in a <a href="false_start" title="wikilink">false start</a> being recorded and the rider penalised (disqualified, or in league matches in Great Britain, a 15-metre penalty or replace the disqualified rider with a team reserve). The race is started with the raising of the start tape mechanism operated by the match referee and the riders must proceed around the track in an <a class="uri" href="anti-clockwise" title="wikilink">anti-clockwise</a> direction without both wheels illegally leaving the track boundaries.</p>

<p>Once a race is underway, no rider can receive outside assistance, including <a href="Bump_starting" title="wikilink">push-starts</a>, from others. Historically, pushers were allowed at the start of the race. A white line at the 30 metre mark used to designate the extent to which a push was allowed but due to safety concerns, assistance is now illegal.</p>

<p>Occasionally races consist of six riders but this is rare as most tracks are too narrow to accommodate the extra riders safely.</p>
<h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>

<p>Speedway operates a sliding scale for scoring (known as the <em>3-2-1-0</em> method). Three points are scored for first place, two points for second place and one point for third place. A rider does not score when finishing fourth, or failing to finish, or if excluded from a race. These points accumulate over the competition, with riders points either counting towards individual or team placings. In the event of a tie, the race is commonly awarded as a <a href="Tie_(draw)" title="wikilink">dead heat</a>. If it is a tie for first place, they will both receive two points. A tie for second place earns each rider one point while a joint-last finish earns each rider zero points. Teams can use a tactical substitute rule once in a meeting. If that team is eight (six in World Cup) or more points in arrears, they may bring in the use of a different rider in their team lineup, to race in any heat except for heat 15. This may be different in World cup or event racing. If they are ten or more points behind, a rider with a scheduled ride may go out for double points, in which the riders points will be doubled if he beats a rider of the opposing team. Any rider taking a tactical substitute ride or double points ride is denoted by a black and white helmet colour as rather than one of the four usual coloured helmets. If that rider remains unbeaten by either opposition rider his scored points are doubled and also count towards the rider's calculated match average (CMA).</p>

<p>CMAs scale from 3.00 to 12.00, any rider scoring above or below this range of values will be awarded the maximum or minimum respectively. These averages are used in leagues such as the Elite League in the UK to identify heat-leaders for the purposes of choosing which riders to enter for each race.</p>

<p>At the start of a season, a rider retains their last recorded CMA (or assessed CMA if they have never previously established one) until they have competed in six home and six away matches. A new CMA is then issued that comes into effect seven days later. These are subsequently updated on the 15th of every month from May onwards, and come into effect on the first of the next month.</p>

<p>These CMA's are used in most professional leagues and are altered or weighted depending on the league the rider gained the CMA in. A rider that has no recorded average will receive an indicative CMA for the start of the season that is assessed on their prior experience in the sport.</p>

<p>An international individual speedway championship has taken various forms since its beginnings in the 1930s, with the official World Championship first held in <a href="1936_Individual_Speedway_World_Championship" title="wikilink">1936</a>. The present FIM <a href="Speedway_Grand_Prix" title="wikilink">Speedway Grand Prix (SGP)</a> championship organised by Speedway Grand Prix (<a href="IMG_(business)" title="wikilink">IMG</a> since 2007) has taken place since 1995. The SGP uses a scoring system based on each riders overall final position. The rider who has gained the most points at the end of the tournament is declared the <a href="Speedway_World_Championship" title="wikilink">World Champion</a>. American rider <a href="Greg_Hancock" title="wikilink">Greg Hancock</a> is the current (2014) World Champion. The annual British Grand Prix is currently held at the <a href="Millennium_Stadium" title="wikilink">Millennium Stadium</a> in <a class="uri" href="Cardiff" title="wikilink">Cardiff</a>, Wales.</p>

<p>Scoring in Grand Prix events changed in 2005 with riders scoring 3-2-1-0 in their races and these points being carried forward to decide the winner of each Grand Prix. At the end of the series the highest scorer becomes the world champion.</p>

<p>World Speedway Champions include <a href="Ivan_Mauger" title="wikilink">Ivan Mauger</a> (six-time World Champion), fellow New Zealander <a href="Barry_Briggs" title="wikilink">Barry Briggs</a> (four-times), <a href="Ole_Olsen_(speedway_rider)" title="wikilink">Ole Olsen</a> (three-times), <a href="Ove_Fundin" title="wikilink">Ove Fundin</a> (five-times), <a href="Lionel_Van_Praag" title="wikilink">Lionel Van Praag</a> (inaugural World Champion in 1936), <a href="Hans_Nielsen_(speedway_rider)" title="wikilink">Hans Nielsen</a> (nicknamed "The Professor", four-times World Champion), <a href="Tony_Rickardsson" title="wikilink">Tony Rickardsson</a> (six-times), <a href="Erik_Gundersen" title="wikilink">Erik Gundersen</a> and <a href="Jason_Crump" title="wikilink">Jason Crump</a>, both three-times World Champions, and the sports first two-time champion <a href="Jack_Young_(speedway_rider)" title="wikilink">Jack Young</a> who won in 1951 &amp; 1952.</p>

<p>The <a href="Speedway_World_Cup" title="wikilink">Speedway World Cup</a> is also held each year, featuring teams from the major speedway countries, usually in a series of meetings over the space of a week in the summer. In 2001 the World Cup replaced the old <a href="Speedway_World_Team_Cup" title="wikilink">Speedway World Team Cup</a> which had first run in 1960. The current World Cup Champions are Denmark (2014).</p>

<p>The <a href="Speedway_World_Pairs_Championship" title="wikilink">Speedway World Pairs Championship</a> was an annual speedway event held each year in different countries. Competing countries picked their top two riders to represent them (or in some cases, those who were available). The first competition was held in 1970 and the final competition was held in 1993. From 1994 the World Pairs was merged with the World Team Cup.</p>
<h2 id="domestic-competitions">Domestic competitions</h2>

<p> Most European countries run their own domestic speedway leagues. The FIM affiliated governing bodies in each country operate <a href="league_system" title="wikilink">league systems</a>, normally comprising several <a href="division_(sport)" title="wikilink">divisions</a>, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into <a href="table_(information)" title="wikilink">tables</a>, placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team races every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a <a href="round-robin_tournament" title="wikilink">round-robin tournament</a>. Meetings traditionally consist of two teams riding against each other with four riders in each race with two home team riders and two away team riders. Meetings usually feature fifteen heats and each rider is scheduled to ride four or five times. The team with the most points at the end of the meeting is the winner. Most league seasons end with <a href="play-off" title="wikilink">play-offs</a> - a series of meetings between the highest finishing teams to determine a league champion. The champions may be <a href="promotion_and_relegation" title="wikilink">promoted</a> to a higher division and the team finishing at the bottom are in some countries <a href="promotion_and_relegation" title="wikilink">relegated</a> to a lower division.</p>

<p>The majority of countries supplement the league system with one or more cup competitions. These are organised on a <a href="single_elimination_tournament" title="wikilink">knock-out</a> basis, the winner of each match proceeding to the next round and the loser taking no further part in the competition.</p>

<p>The major speedway nations in Europe are the United Kingdom, Sweden, Poland and Denmark. These countries run a number of leagues and have regular fixtures throughout the traditional speedway season that runs from March to October. On a smaller scale, competitions are also held in Argentina, Australia, Czech Republic, Italy, Russia, Slovenia and the United States. Some countries' top divisions feature highly paid star riders. In smaller countries and lower divisions, riders may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs.</p>

<h3 id="sweden">Sweden</h3>

<p>Speedway in Sweden is governed by the <em>Swedish Motorcycle and Snowmobile Federation (SVEMO)</em>. The first Swedish speedway league was founded in 1948 and copied the British format of league racing, including adopting the Swedish version of several British teams nicknames.</p>

<p>The Elite League (<a href="Elitserien_(speedway)" title="wikilink">Elitserien</a>) was established in 1982 and has ten teams. At the end of each season the top four teams ride in the <a class="uri" href="play-offs" title="wikilink">play-offs</a> in semi-finals and a final and the winner of the final are the Elitserien champions. The team finishing bottom of the league are relegated to the National league (Allsvenskan). The Allsvenskan has seven teams and before the introduction of the Elitserien in 1982 was the top flight speedway league in Sweden. As with the Allsvenskan, the top four teams at the end of each season ride in the play-offs in semi-finals and a final. The Allsvenskan Division One is the third tier of Swedish speedway with seven teams. The team finishing the season in first place are champions and can apply for promotion to the Allsvenskan, subject to having suitable facilities and sufficient finances.</p>

<h3 id="denmark">Denmark</h3>

<p>Speedway in Denmark is administrated by <em>Danmarks Motor Union (DMU)</em>. The sport was introduced into Denmark in the 1930s but it didn't boom until the 1970s. Notable Danish speedway riders today include - Nicki Pedersen, Bjarne Pedersen and Hans Nørgaard Andersen. Former rider, Ole Olsen won the World Championship three times and his success helped popularise the sport in Denmark. Since retiring Olsen has become an FIM Speedway Grand Prix race director. A popular Danish rider in the 1960s was Arne Pander, and in the 1980s Erik Gundersen, Jan O Pedersen and Hans Nielsen (who was also an active racer through the 1990s).</p>
<h4 id="league-competitions">League competitions</h4>

<p>There are three leagues in Denmark.:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="Danish_Speedway_League" title="wikilink">Danish League</a> (Dansk Speedway Liga)</em></li>
<li><em>Division One</em></li>
<li><em>Division Two</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Speedway meetings are held between April and September.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The Danish League (Dansk Speedway Liga) has six teams with meetings traditionally held on Wednesday evenings. At the end of each season the top four teams compete in the play-offs in semi-finals and a final. The winner of the final are the league champions. There is no promotion or relegation and membership of the Danish League is by application only.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> At the end of each season the top five teams in the Danish League compete in the ''Danish Super Cup', an end-of-season competition, held as a single event. It is hosted by the winning team from the previous season.</p>

<p>Both Division One and Division Two are the second and third tier and are mostly for amateur riders. Meetings are held on Saturdays with a mid-summer break. Division One can have a maximum of eight teams, with the remaining teams riding in Division Two. Meetings are staged using a four-team format. In principle, the team finishing bottom of Division One is relegated and replaced by the top team in Division Two as long as their parent club does not already have a team in Division One. However, this does not always happen for financial reasons. There is also no promotion and relegation if the bottom team in Division One and the top team in Division Two are operated by same club.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<h5 id="australia">Australia</h5>

<p>Although there was a short lived inter-state competition in Australia during the 1970s, due to the large size of the country riders have traditionally raced mostly at their local tracks, though the top riders often race away from 'home' for championship or other high profile meetings.</p>

<p>The <a href="Australian_Individual_Speedway_Championship" title="wikilink">Australian Individual Speedway Championship</a> is the oldest continuously running national speedway championship in the world having been run since 1926 with the exception of 1942–1945 when racing was suspended during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, and 1955–1961 when the championship was not held. The first championship was held at the <a href="Newcastle_Showgrounds" title="wikilink">Newcastle Showgrounds</a> in <a href="Newcastle,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Newcastle</a>, <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a> and was won by was won by American rider <a href="Cecil_Brown_(speedway_rider)" title="wikilink">Cec Brown</a>. For a number of years qualification for the Australian Final came from the various State Championships held around the country. The Australian Final was held in various Australian states, usually on a rotating basis. The top places in the Final would then progress to the next stage of the World Championship qualifying. At times the next stage varied from the short lived <a href="Australasian_Individual_Speedway_Championship" title="wikilink">Australasian Final</a> which included riders from New Zealand, the <a href="Overseas_Final" title="wikilink">Overseas Final</a> which saw Commonwealth riders race with the Americans, or the <a href="Commonwealth_Final" title="wikilink">Commonwealth Final</a> which was restricted to riders from <a href="Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="wikilink">Commonwealth nations</a>. The Australian Solo Final was run in the traditional single meeting format from 1926-2002 (though in the early years of the championship there was often more than one title contested as championships were held over anywhere from 3-6 laps, often depending on the size of the track). Since 2003 the Australian Championship has been run over a series of rounds (usually 3-5 rounds).</p>

<p>Australia also runs annual national Championship meetings for <a href="Australian_Under-16_Individual_Speedway_Championship" title="wikilink">Under-16</a>'s (since 1982) and <a href="Australian_Under-21_Individual_Speedway_Championship" title="wikilink">Under-21</a>'s (since 1987). These meetings are run in the traditional single meeting format and like the senior championship was for a number of years, the Finals are held in various Australian states on a rotating basis.</p>
