   Vermeil's theorem      Vermeil's theorem   In differential geometry , Vermeil's theorem essentially states that that the scalar curvature is the only (non trivial) absolute invariant among those of prescribed type suitable for Einstein ’s theory. 1 The theorem was proved by the German mathematician Hermann Vermeil in 1917. 2  Standard version of the theorem  The theorem states that the Ricci scalar    R   R   R    3 is the only scalar invariant (or absolute invariant) linear in the second derivatives of the metric tensor     g   μ  ν      subscript  g    μ  ν     g_{\mu\nu}   .
