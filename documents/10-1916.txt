   2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase      2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase   In enzymology , a 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   succinate semialdehyde + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-oxoglutarate , and two products , succinate semialdehyde and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-oxoglutarate carboxy-lyase (succinate-semialdehyde-forming) . Other names in common use include oxoglutarate decarboxylase , alpha-ketoglutarate decarboxylase , alpha-ketoglutaric decarboxylase , oxoglutarate decarboxylase , pre-2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase , and 2-oxoglutarate carboxy-lyase . It employs one cofactor , thiamin diphosphate .  References     "  Category:EC 4.1.1  Category:Thiamine enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
