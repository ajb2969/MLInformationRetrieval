Interpretability logic




Interpretability logic

Interpretability logics comprise a family of modal logics that extend provability logic to describe interpretability and/or various related metamathematical properties and relations such as weak interpretability, Π1-conservativity, cointerpretability, tolerance, cotolerance, and arithmetic complexities.
Main contributors to the field are Alessandro Berarducci, Petr Hájek, Konstantin Ignatiev, Giorgi Japaridze, Franco Montagna, Vladimir Shavrukov, Rineke Verbrugge, Albert Visser, and Domenico Zambella.
Examples

Logic ILM: The language of ILM extends that of classical propositional logic by adding the unary modal operator 
 
 
 
  and the binary modal operator 
 
 
 
  (as always, 
 
 
 
  is defined as 
 
 
 
 ). The arithmetical interpretation of 
 
 
 
  is “
 
 
 
  is provable in Peano Arithmetic PA”, and 
 
 
 
  is understood as “
 
 
 
  is interpretable in 
 
 
 
 ”.

Axiom schemata:
1. All classical tautologies
2. 
 
 

3. 
 
 

4. 
 
 

5. 
 
 

6. 
 
 

7. 
 
 

8. 
 
 

9. 
 
 

Rules inference:
1. “From 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  conclude 
 
 
 
 ”
2. “From 
 
 
 
  conclude 
 
 
 
 ”.
The completeness of ILM with respect to its arithmetical interpretation was independently proven by Alessandro Berarducci and Vladimir Shavrukov.

Logic TOL: The language of TOL extends that of classical propositional logic by adding the modal operator 
 
 
 
  which is allowed to take any nonempty sequence of arguments. The arithmetical interpretation of 
 
 
 
  is “
 
 
 
  is a tolerant sequence of theories”.

Axioms (with 
 
 
 
  standing for any formulas, 
 
 
 
  for any sequences of formulas, and 
 
 
 
  identified with ⊤):
1. All classical tautologies
2. 
 
 

3. 
 
 

4. 
 
 

5. 
 
 

6. 
 
 

7. 
 
 

Rules inference:
1. “From 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  conclude 
 
 
 
 ”
2. “From 
 
 
 
  conclude 
 
 
 
 ”.
The completeness of TOL with respect to its arithmetical interpretation was proven by Giorgi Japaridze.
