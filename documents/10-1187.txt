   2-oxo-acid reductase      2-oxo-acid reductase   In enzymology , a 2-oxo-acid reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a (2R)-hydroxy-carboxylate + acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a 2-oxo-carboxylate + reduced acceptor   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (2R)-hydroxy-carboxylate and acceptor , whereas its two products are 2-oxo-carboxylate and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (2R)-hydroxy-carboxylate:acceptor oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include (2R)-hydroxycarboxylate-viologen-oxidoreductase , HVOR , and 2-oxoacid reductase .  References      "  Category:EC 1.1.99  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
