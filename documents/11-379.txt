   Phospholipid-translocating ATPase      Phospholipid-translocating ATPase   In enzymology , a phospholipid-translocating ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O + phospholipidin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + phospholipidout   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , H 2 O , and phospholipid , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and phospholipid .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (phospholipid-flipping) . Other names in common use include Mg 2+ -ATPase , flippase , and aminophospholipid-transporting ATPase .
