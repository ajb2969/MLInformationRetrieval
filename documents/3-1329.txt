   Hausdorff measure      Hausdorff measure  In [[mathematics] ] a Hausdorff measure is a type of outer measure , named for Felix Hausdorff , that assigns a number in [0,∞] to each set in R n or, more generally, in any metric space . The zero-dimensional Hausdorff measure is the number of points in the set (if the set is finite) or ∞ if the set is infinite. The one-dimensional Hausdorff measure of a simple curve in R n is equal to the length of the curve. Likewise, the two dimensional Hausdorff measure of a measurable subset of R 2 is proportional to the area of the set. Thus, the concept of the Hausdorff measure generalizes counting, length, and area. It also generalizes volume. In fact, there are d -dimensional Hausdorff measures for any d ≥ 0, which is not necessarily an integer. These measures are fundamental in geometric measure theory . They appear naturally in harmonic analysis or potential theory .  Definition  Let    (  X  ,  ρ  )     X  ρ    (X,\rho)   be a metric space. For any subset    U  ⊂  X      U  X    \scriptstyle U\subset X   , let     diam   U      diam  U    \mathrm{diam}\;U   denote its diameter, that is         diam   U   :=   sup   {   ρ   (  x  ,  y  )    |    x  ,  y   ∈  U   }     ,     diam   ∅   :=  0      formulae-sequence   assign    diam  U    supremum   conditional-set    ρ   x  y       x  y   U       assign    diam    0     \mathrm{diam}\;U:=\sup\{\rho(x,y)|x,y\in U\},\quad\mathrm{diam}\;\emptyset:=0     Let    S   S   S    be any subset of    X   X   X    , and    δ  >  0      δ  0    \delta>0   a real number. Define         H  δ  d    (  S  )    =   inf   {    ∑   i  =  1   ∞     (   diam   U  i    )   d    :      ⋃   i  =  1   ∞    U  i    ⊇  S   ,    diam   U  i    <  δ    }     .         subscript   superscript  H  d   δ   S    infimum   conditional-set    superscript   subscript     i  1       superscript   diam   subscript  U  i    d     formulae-sequence    S    superscript   subscript     i  1       subscript  U  i        diam   subscript  U  i    δ        H^{d}_{\delta}(S)=\inf\Bigl\{\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}(\operatorname{diam}\;U_{i})^{%
 d}:\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}U_{i}\supseteq S,\,\operatorname{diam}\;U_{i}<\delta%
 \Bigr\}.     (The infimum is over all countable covers of    S   S   S    by sets     U  i   ⊂  X       subscript  U  i   X    \scriptstyle U_{i}\subset X   satisfying     diam   U  i    <  δ       diam   subscript  U  i    δ    \scriptstyle\operatorname{diam}\;U_{i}<\delta   .)  Note that     H  δ  d    (  S  )        subscript   superscript  H  d   δ   S    \scriptstyle H^{d}_{\delta}(S)   is monotone decreasing in   δ   δ   \delta   since the larger   δ   δ   \delta   is, the more collections of sets are permitted, making the infimum smaller. Thus, the limit     lim   δ  →  0      H  δ  d    (  S  )        subscript    normal-→  δ  0       subscript   superscript  H  d   δ   S     \scriptstyle\lim_{\delta\to 0}H^{d}_{\delta}(S)   exists but may be infinite. Let         H  d    (  S  )    :=    sup   δ  >  0      H  δ  d    (  S  )     =    lim   δ  →  0      H  δ  d    (  S  )      .       assign     superscript  H  d   S     subscript  supremum    δ  0       subscript   superscript  H  d   δ   S           subscript    normal-→  δ  0       subscript   superscript  H  d   δ   S       H^{d}(S):=\sup_{\delta>0}H^{d}_{\delta}(S)=\lim_{\delta\to 0}H^{d}_{\delta}(S).     It can be seen that     H  d    (  S  )        superscript  H  d   S    H^{d}(S)   is an outer measure (more precisely, it is a metric outer measure ). By general theory, its restriction to the σ-field of Carathéodory-measurable sets is a measure. It is called the   d   d   d   - dimensional Hausdorff measure of   S   S   S   . Due to the metric outer measure property, all Borel subsets of   X   X   X   are    H  d     superscript  H  d    H^{d}   measurable.  In the above definition the sets in the covering are arbitrary. However, they may be taken to be open or closed, and will yield the same measure, although the approximations     H  δ  d    (  S  )        subscript   superscript  H  d   δ   S    \scriptstyle H^{d}_{\delta}(S)   may be different . If    X   X   X    is a normed space the sets may be taken to be convex. However, the restriction of the covering families to balls gives a different measure. 1  Properties of Hausdorff measures  Note that if d is a positive integer, the d dimensional Hausdorff measure of R d is a rescaling of usual d -dimensional Lebesgue measure     λ  d     subscript  λ  d    \lambda_{d}   which is normalized so that the Lebesgue measure of the unit cube [0,1] d is 1. In fact, for any Borel set E ,        λ  d    (  E  )    =    2   -  d     α  d    H  d    (  E  )           subscript  λ  d   E      superscript  2    d     subscript  α  d    superscript  H  d   E     \lambda_{d}(E)=2^{-d}\alpha_{d}H^{d}(E)\,   where α d is the volume of the unit d -ball ; it can be expressed using Euler's gamma function        α  d   =    Γ    (   1  2   )   d     Γ   (    d  2   +  1   )     =    π   d  /  2     Γ   (    d  2   +  1   )      .         subscript  α  d       normal-Γ   superscript    1  2   d      normal-Γ      d  2   1             superscript  π    d  2      normal-Γ      d  2   1        \alpha_{d}=\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{2})^{d}}{\Gamma(\frac{d}{2}+1)}=\frac{\pi^{d/%
 2}}{\Gamma(\frac{d}{2}+1)}.     Remark . Some authors adopt a definition of Hausdorff measure slightly different from the one chosen here, the difference being that it is normalized in such a way that Hausdorff d -dimensional measure in the case of Euclidean space coincides exactly with Lebesgue measure.  Relation with Hausdorff dimension  One of several possible equivalent definitions of the Hausdorff dimension is         dim  Haus    (  S  )    =   inf   {   d  ≥  0   :     H  d    (  S  )    =  0   }    =   sup   (    {   d  ≥  0   :     H  d    (  S  )    =  ∞   }   ∪   {  0  }    )     ,          subscript  dim  Haus   S    infimum   conditional-set    d  0        superscript  H  d   S   0           supremum     conditional-set    d  0        superscript  H  d   S       0        \operatorname{dim}_{\mathrm{Haus}}(S)=\inf\{d\geq 0:H^{d}(S)=0\}=\sup\bigl(\{d%
 \geq 0:H^{d}(S)=\infty\}\cup\{0\}\bigr),     where we take        inf  ∅   =  ∞   .       infimum       \inf\emptyset=\infty.\,     Generalizations  In geometric measure theory and related fields, the Minkowski content is often used to measure the size of a subset of a metric measure space. For suitable domains in Euclidean space, the two notions of size coincide, up to overall normalizations depending on conventions. More precisely, a subset of    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \scriptstyle\mathbb{R}^{n}   is said to be    m   m   m    -rectifiable if it is the image of a bounded set in    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \scriptstyle\mathbb{R}^{n}   under a Lipschitz function . If   m   m   m   ''-dimensional Minkowski content of a closed     ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \scriptstyle\mathbb{R}^{n}    -rectifiable subset of     2   -  m     α  m        superscript  2    m     subscript  α  m     2^{-m}\alpha_{m}   is equal to   m   m   m   times the    d   d   d    -dimensional Hausdorff measure .  In fractal geometry , some fractals with Hausdorff dimension   d   d   d   have zero or infinite     |   U  i   |   d     superscript     subscript  U  i    d    |U_{i}|^{d}   -dimensional Hausdorff measure. For example, almost surely the image of planar Brownian motion has Hausdorff dimension 2 and its two-dimensional Hausdoff measure is zero. In order to “measure” the “size” of such sets, mathematicians have considered the following variation on the notion of the Hausdorff measure:   In the definition of the measure    ϕ   (   U  i   )       ϕ   subscript  U  i     \phi(U_{i})   is replaced with   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   , where     ϕ   (  ∅  )    =  0        ϕ    0    \phi(\emptyset)=0   is any monotone increasing set function satisfying   S   S   S   .   This is the Hausdorff measure of   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   with gauge function    ϕ   ϕ   \phi   , or   d   d   d   -Hausdorff measure. A   S   S   S   -dimensional set      H  d    (  S  )    =  0         superscript  H  d   S   0    H^{d}(S)=0   may satisfy      H  ϕ    (  S  )    ∈   (  0  ,  ∞  )          superscript  H  ϕ   S    0      \scriptstyle H^{\phi}(S)\in(0,\infty)   , but    ϕ  .    ϕ   \phi.   with an appropriate     ϕ   (  t  )    =     t  2     log   log    1  t             ϕ  t      superscript  t  2         1  t        \scriptstyle\phi(t)=t^{2}\,\log\log\frac{1}{t}   Examples of gauge functions include     ϕ   (  t  )    =    t  2    log     1  t     log   log   log    1  t                ϕ  t      superscript  t  2         1  t           1  t           \scriptstyle\phi(t)=t^{2}\log\frac{1}{t}\log\log\log\frac{1}{t}   or   σ   σ   \sigma   . The former gives almost surely positive and    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \scriptstyle\mathbb{R}^{n}   -finite measure to the Brownian path in    n  >  2      n  2    n>2   when    n  =  2      n  2    n=2   , and the latter when $n=2$ .
