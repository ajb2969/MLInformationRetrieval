   Fischer group Fi22      Fischer group Fi22     In the area of modern algebra known as group theory , the Fischer group  Fi 22 is a sporadic simple group of order   2 17 {{·}}3 9 {{·}}5 2 {{·}}7{{·}}11{{·}}13  = 64561751654400  ≈ 6     ×    10  1   3       absent     superscript  10  1   3     \times 10^{1}3   .   History  Fi 22 is one of the 26 sporadic groups and is the smallest of the three Fischer groups. It was introduced by  while investigating 3-transposition groups .  The outer automorphism group has order 2, and the Schur multiplier has order 6.  Representations  The Fischer group Fi 22 has a rank 3 action on a graph of 3510 vertices corresponding to its 3-transpositions, with point stabilizer the double cover of the group PSU 6 (2). It also has two rank 3 actions on 14080 points, exchanged by an outer automorphism.  Fi 22 has an irreducible real representation of dimension 78. Reducing an integral form of this mod 3 gives a representation of Fi 22 over the field with 3 elements, whose quotient by the 1-dimensional space of fixed vectors is a 77-dimensional irreducible representation.  The perfect triple cover of Fi 22 has an irreducible representation of dimension 27 over the field with 4 elements. This arises from the fact that Fi 22 is a subgroup of ²E₆(2²). All the ordinary and modular character tables of Fi 22 have been computed.  found the 5-modular character table,and  found the 2- and 3-modular character tables.  The automorphism group of Fi 22 centralizes an element of order 3 in the baby monster .  Generalized Monstrous Moonshine  Conway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that monstrous moonshine is not limited to the monster, but that similar phenomena may be found for other groups. Larissa Queen and others subsequently found that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln from simple combinations of dimensions of sporadic groups. For Fi 22 , the McKay-Thompson series is     T   6  A     (  τ  )        subscript  T    6  A    τ    T_{6A}(\tau)   where one can set a(0) = 10 (),       j   6  A     (  τ  )        subscript  j    6  A    τ    \displaystyle j_{6A}(\tau)     and η ( τ ) is the Dedekind eta function .  Maximal subgroups  found the 12 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of Fi 22 as follows:   2·U 6 (2)  O 7 (3) (Two classes, fused by an outer automorphism)  O(2):S 3  2 10 :M 22  2 6 :S 6 (2)  (2 × 2 1+8 ):(U 4 (2):2)  U 4 (3):2 × S 3  2 F 4 (2)'  2 5+8 :(S 3 × A 6 )  3 1+6 :2 3+4 :3 2 :2  S 10 (Two classes, fused by an outer automorphism)  M 12   References    contains a complete proof of Fischer's theorem.    This is the first part of Fischer's preprint on the construction of his groups. The remainder of the paper is unpublished (as of 2010).       Wilson, R. A. ATLAS of Finite Group Representations.
