   Galactose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase      Galactose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase   In enzymology , a galactose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dTTP + alpha-D-galactose 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + dTDP-galactose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dTTP and alpha-D-galactose 1-phosphate , whereas its two products are diphosphate and dTDP-galactose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is dTTP:alpha-D-galactose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase . Other names in common use include dTDP galactose pyrophosphorylase , galactose 1-phosphate thymidylyl transferase , thymidine diphosphogalactose pyrophosphorylase , thymidine triphosphate:alpha-D-galactose 1-phosphate , and thymidylyltransferase . This enzyme participates in nucleotide sugars metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.7.7  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
