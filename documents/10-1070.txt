   Gibberellin 2beta-dioxygenase      Gibberellin 2beta-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a gibberellin 2beta-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   gibberellin 1 + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2beta-hydroxygibberellin 1 + succinate + CO 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are gibberellin 1 , 2-oxoglutarate , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 2beta-hydroxygibberellin 1 , succinate , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (gibberellin-1),2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (2beta-hydroxylating) . This enzyme is also called gibberellin 2beta-hydroxylase . This enzyme participates in diterpenoid biosynthesis .  References     "  Category:EC 1.14.11  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
