   Kirszbraun theorem      Kirszbraun theorem   In mathematics , specifically real analysis and functional analysis , the Kirszbraun theorem states that if U is a subset of some Hilbert space  H 1 , and H 2 is another Hilbert space, and   f : U → H 2    is a Lipschitz-continuous map, then there is a Lipschitz-continuous map   F : H 1 → H 2    that extends f and has the same Lipschitz constant as f .  Note that this result in particular applies to Euclidean spaces  E n and E m , and it was in this form that Kirszbraun originally formulated and proved the theorem. 1 The version for Hilbert spaces can for example be found in (Schwartz 1969, p. 21). 2 If H 1 is a separable space (in particular, if it is a Euclidean space) the result is true in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory ; for the fully general case, it appears to need some form of the axiom of choice; the Boolean prime ideal theorem is known to be sufficient. 3  The proof of the theorem uses geometric features of Hilbert spaces; the corresponding statement for Banach spaces is not true in general, not even for finite-dimensional Banach spaces. It is for instance possible to construct counterexamples where the domain is a subset of R n with the maximum norm and R m carries the Euclidean norm. 4 More generally, the theorem fails for    ℝ  m     superscript  ℝ  m    \mathbb{R}^{m}   equipped with any    ℓ  p     subscript  normal-ℓ  p    \ell_{p}   norm (    p  ≠  2      p  2    p\neq 2   ) (Schwartz 1969, p. 20). 5  For an R -valued function the extension is provided by       f  ~    (  x  )    :=     inf   u  ∈  U     f   (  u  )     +     Lip   (  f  )    ⋅  d    (  x  ,  u  )      ,     assign     normal-~  f   x       subscript  infimum    u  U      f  u       normal-⋅    Lip  f   d    x  u       \tilde{f}(x):=\inf_{u\in U}f(u)+\text{Lip}(f)\cdot d(x,u),   where    Lip   (  f  )       Lip  f    \text{Lip}(f)   is f's Lipschitz constant on U.  History  The theorem was proved by Mojżesz David Kirszbraun , and later it was reproved by Frederick Valentine , 6 who first proved it for the Euclidean plane. 7 Sometimes this theorem is also called Kirszbraun–Valentine theorem .
