Dempwolff group

In mathematical finite group theory, the Dempwolff group is a finite group of order 319979520 = 215·32·5·7·31, that is the unique nonsplit extension 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  by its natural module of order 
 
 
 
 . The uniqueness of such a nonsplit extension was shown by , and the existence by , who showed using some computer calculations of  that the Dempwolff group is contained in the compact Lie group 
 
 
 
  as the subgroup fixing a certain lattice in the Lie algebra of 
 
 
 
 , and is also contained in the Thompson sporadic group (the full automorphism group of this lattice) as a maximal subgroup.
showed that that any extension of 
 
 
 
  by its natural module 
 
 
 
  splits if 
 
 
 
 , and  showed that it also splits if 
 
 
 
  is not 3, 4, or 5, and in each of these three cases there is just one non-split extension. These three nonsplit extensions can be constructed as follows:

The nonsplit extension 
 
 
 
  is a maximal subgroup of the Chevalley group

 
 .
The nonsplit extension 
 
 
 
  is a maximal subgroup of the sporadic Conway group Co3.
The nonsplit extension 
 
 
 
  is a maximal subgroup of the Thompson sporadic group Th.
