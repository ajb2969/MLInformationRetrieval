   Dempwolff group      Dempwolff group   In mathematical finite group theory, the Dempwolff group is a finite group of order 319979520 = 2 15 ·3 2 ·5·7·31, that is the unique nonsplit extension     2  5 .    GL  5    (   𝔽  2   )        superscript  2  5 .    subscript  GL  5    subscript  𝔽  2     2^{5\,.}\mathrm{GL}_{5}(\mathbb{F}_{2})   of     GL  5    (   𝔽  2   )        subscript  GL  5    subscript  𝔽  2     \mathrm{GL}_{5}(\mathbb{F}_{2})   by its natural module of order    2  5     superscript  2  5    2^{5}   . The uniqueness of such a nonsplit extension was shown by , and the existence by , who showed using some computer calculations of  that the Dempwolff group is contained in the compact Lie group    E  8     subscript  E  8    E_{8}   as the subgroup fixing a certain lattice in the Lie algebra of    E  8     subscript  E  8    E_{8}   , and is also contained in the Thompson sporadic group (the full automorphism group of this lattice) as a maximal subgroup.  showed that that any extension of     GL  n    (   𝔽  q   )        subscript  GL  n    subscript  𝔽  q     \mathrm{GL}_{n}(\mathbb{F}_{q})   by its natural module    𝔽  q  n     superscript   subscript  𝔽  q   n    \mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}   splits if    q  >  2      q  2    q>2   , and  showed that it also splits if   n   n   n   is not 3, 4, or 5, and in each of these three cases there is just one non-split extension. These three nonsplit extensions can be constructed as follows:   The nonsplit extension     2  3 .

The nonsplit extension     2  4 .    GL  4    (   𝔽  2   )        superscript  2  4 .    subscript  GL  4    subscript  𝔽  2     2^{4\,.}\mathrm{GL}_{4}(\mathbb{F}_{2})   is a maximal subgroup of the sporadic Conway group Co 3 .
