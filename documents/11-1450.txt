   CDP-diacylglycerol—inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase      CDP-diacylglycerol—inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase   In enzymology , a CDP-diacylglycerol—inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CDP-diacylglycerol + myo-inositol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CMP + phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CDP-diacylglycerol and myo-inositol , whereas its two products are CMP and phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring non-standard substituted phosphate groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CDP-diacylglycerol:myo-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase . Other names in common use include CDP-diglyceride-inositol phosphatidyltransferase , phosphatidylinositol synthase , CDP-diacylglycerol-inositol phosphatidyltransferase , CDP-diglyceride:inositol transferase , cytidine 5'-diphospho-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol:myo-inositol , 3-phosphatidyltransferase , CDP-DG:inositol transferase , cytidine diphosphodiglyceride-inositol phosphatidyltransferase , CDP-diacylglycerol:myo-inositol-3-phosphatidyltransferase , CDP-diglyceride-inositol transferase , cytidine diphosphoglyceride-inositol phosphatidyltransferase , and cytidine diphosphoglyceride-inositol transferase . This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism and phosphatidylinositol signaling system .  References        "  Category:EC 2.7.8  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
