   (acetyl-CoA carboxylase)-phosphatase      (acetyl-CoA carboxylase)-phosphatase   In enzymology , a [acetyl-CoA carboxylase]-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   [acetyl-CoA carboxylase] phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   [acetyl-CoA carboxylase] + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are acetyl-CoA carboxylase and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is [acetyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming)]-phosphate phosphohydrolase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
