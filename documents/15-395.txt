   Kolmogorov automorphism      Kolmogorov automorphism   In mathematics , a Kolmogorov automorphism , K -automorphism , K -shift or K -system is an invertible, measure-preserving  automorphism defined on a standard probability space that obeys Kolmogorov's zero-one law . 1 All Bernoulli automorphisms are K -automorphisms (one says they have the K -property ), but not vice versa. Many ergodic  dynamical systems have been shown to have the K -property, although more recent research has shown that many of these are in fact Bernoulli automorphisms.  Although the definition of the K -property seems reasonably general, it stands in sharp distinction to the Bernoulli automorphism. In particular, the Ornstein isomorphism theorem does not apply to K -systems, and so the entropy is not sufficient to classify such systems – there exist uncountably many non-isomorphic K -systems with the same entropy. In essence, the collection of K -systems is large, messy and uncategorized; whereas the B -automorphisms are 'completely' described by Ornstein theory .  Formal definition  Let    (  X  ,  ℬ  ,  μ  )     X  ℬ  μ    (X,\mathcal{B},\mu)   be a standard probability space , and let   T   T   T   be an invertible, measure-preserving transformation . Then   T   T   T   is called a K -automorphism, K -transform or K -shift, if there exists a sub- sigma algebra     𝒦  ⊂  ℬ      𝒦  ℬ    \mathcal{K}\subset\mathcal{B}   such that the following three properties hold:       (1)  𝒦   ⊂   T  𝒦         (1)  𝒦     T  𝒦     \mbox{(1) }\mathcal{K}\subset T\mathcal{K}          (2)    ⋁   n  =  0   ∞     T  n   𝒦     =  ℬ        (2)    superscript   subscript     n  0         superscript  T  n   𝒦     ℬ    \mbox{(2) }\bigvee_{n=0}^{\infty}T^{n}\mathcal{K}=\mathcal{B}          (3)    ⋂   n  =  0   ∞     T   -  n    𝒦     =   {  X  ,  ∅  }         (3)    superscript   subscript     n  0         superscript  T    n    𝒦      X      \mbox{(3) }\bigcap_{n=0}^{\infty}T^{-n}\mathcal{K}=\{X,\varnothing\}     Here, the symbol   ∨     \vee   is the join of sigma algebras , while   ∩     \cap   is set intersection . The equality should be understood as holding almost everywhere , that is, differing at most on a set of measure zero .  Properties  Assuming that the sigma algebra is not trivial, that is, if    ℬ  ≠   {  X  ,  ∅  }       ℬ   X      \mathcal{B}\neq\{X,\varnothing\}   , then     𝒦  ≠   T  𝒦    .      𝒦    T  𝒦     \mathcal{K}\neq T\mathcal{K}.   It follows that K -automorphisms are strong mixing .  All Bernoulli automorphisms are K -automorphisms, but not vice versa .
