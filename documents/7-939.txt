   String diagram      String diagram   In category theory , string diagrams are a way of representing 2-cells in 2-categories .  Definition  The idea is to represent structures of dimension d by structures of dimension 2-d , using the Poincaré duality . Thus,   an object is represented by a portion of plane,  a 1-cell    f  :   A  →  B      normal-:  f   normal-→  A  B     f:A\to B   is represented by a vertical segment — called a string — separating the plane in two (the left part corresponding to A and the right one to B ),  a 2-cell    α  :   f  ⇒  g   :   A  →  B        normal-:  α   normal-⇒  f  g     normal-:     normal-→  A  B      \alpha:f\Rightarrow g:A\to B   is represented by an intersection of strings (the strings corresponding to f above the link, the strings corresponding to g below the link).   The parallel composition of 2-cells corresponds to the horizontal juxtaposition of diagrams and the sequential composition to the vertical juxtaposition of diagrams.  Example  Consider an adjunction     (  F  ,  G  ,  η  ,  ε  )     F  G  η  ε    (F,G,\eta,\varepsilon)   between two categories   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   and   𝒟   𝒟   \mathcal{D}   where    F  :   𝒞  ←  𝒟      normal-:  F   normal-←  𝒞  𝒟     F:\mathcal{C}\leftarrow\mathcal{D}   is left adjoint of    G  :   𝒞  →  𝒟      normal-:  G   normal-→  𝒞  𝒟     G:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{D}   and the natural transformations    η  :   I  →   G  F       normal-:  η   normal-→  I    G  F      \eta:I\rightarrow GF   and    ε  :    F  G   →  I      normal-:  ε   normal-→    F  G   I     \varepsilon:FG\rightarrow I   are respectively the unit and the counit. The string diagrams corresponding to these natural transformations are:  The string corresponding to the identity functor is drawn as a dotted line and can be omitted. The definition of an adjunction requires the following equalities:        (   ε  F   )   ∘  F    (  η  )           ε  F   F   η    \displaystyle(\varepsilon F)\circ F(\eta)   The first one is depicted as  Other diagrammatic languages  Monoidal categories can also be pictured this way 1 since a strict monoidal category can be seen as a 2-category with only one object (there will therefore be only one type of plane) and Mac Lane's strictness theorem states that any monoidal category is monoidally equivalent to a strict one. The graphical language of string diagrams for monoidal categories may be extended to represent expressions in categories with other structure, such as symmetric monoidal categories , dagger categories , 2 and is related to geometric presentations for braided monoidal categories 3 and ribbon categories . 4  External links     References  "  Category:Higher category theory  Category:Monoidal categories     A.
