   Transfer (group theory)      Transfer (group theory)   In the mathematical field of group theory , the transfer defines, given a group  G and a subgroup of finite index  H , a group homomorphism from G to the abelianization of H . It can be used in conjunction with the Sylow theorems to obtain certain numerical results on the existence of finite simple groups.  The transfer was defined by  and rediscovered by . 1  Construction  The construction of the map proceeds as follows: 2 Let [ G : H ] = n and select coset  representatives , say        x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n    ,      subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{1},\dots,x_{n},\,   for H in G , so G can be written as a disjoint union       G  =   ∪    x  i   H     .      G       subscript  x  i   H      G=\cup\ x_{i}H.   Given y in G , each yx i is in some coset x j H and so       y   x  i    =    x  j    h  i          y   subscript  x  i       subscript  x  j    subscript  h  i      yx_{i}=x_{j}h_{i}   for some index j and some element h i of H . The value of the transfer for y is defined to be the image of the product        ∏   i  =  1   n     h  i       superscript   subscript  product    i  1    n    subscript  h  i     \textstyle\prod_{i=1}^{n}h_{i}   in H / H ′, where H ′ is the commutator subgroup of H . The order of the factors is irrelevant since H / H ′ is abelian.  It is straightforward to show that, though the individual h i depends on the choice of coset representatives, the value of the transfer does not. It's also straightforward to show that the mapping defined this way is a homomorphism.  Example  If G is abelian then the transfer takes any element y of G to y [ G : H ] .  A simple case is that seen in the Gauss lemma on quadratic residues , which in effect computes the transfer for the multiplicative group of non-zero residue classes modulo a prime number  p , with respect to the subgroup {1, −1}. 3 One advantage of looking at it that way is the ease with which the correct generalisation can be found, for example for cubic residues in the case that p − 1 is divisible by three.  Homological interpretation  This homomorphism may be set in the context of group cohomology (strictly, group homology ), providing a more abstract definition. 4 The transfer is also seen in algebraic topology , when it is defined between classifying spaces of groups.  Terminology  The name transfer translates the German Verlagerung , which was coined by Helmut Hasse .  Commutator subgroup  If G is finitely generated, the commutator subgroup  G ′ of G has finite index in G and H=G ′, then the corresponding transfer map is trivial. In other words, the map sends G to 0 in the abelianization of G ′. This is important in proving the principal ideal theorem in class field theory . 5 See the Emil Artin - John Tate  Class Field Theory notes.  See also   Focal subgroup theorem , an important application of transfer  By Artin's reciprocity law, the Artin transfer describes the principalization of ideal classes in extensions of algebraic number fields.
