   Hydroxylysine kinase      Hydroxylysine kinase   In enzymology , a hydroxylysine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GTP + 5-hydroxy-L-lysine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GDP + 5-phosphonooxy-L-lysine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GTP and 5-hydroxy-L-lysine , whereas its two products are GDP and 5-phosphonooxy-L-lysine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GTP:5-hydroxy-L-lysine O-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include hydroxylysine kinase (phosphorylating) , and guanosine triphosphate:5-hydroxy-L-lysine O-phosphotransferase . This enzyme participates in lysine degradation .
