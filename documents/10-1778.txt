   L-serine ammonia-lyase      L-serine ammonia-lyase   In enzymology , a L-serine ammonia-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-serine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyruvate + NH 3    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , L-serine , and two products , pyruvate and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically ammonia lyases, which cleave carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-serine ammonia-lyase (pyruvate-forming) . Other names in common use include serine deaminase , L-hydroxyaminoacid dehydratase , L-serine deaminase , L-serine dehydratase , and L-serine hydro-lyase (deaminating) . This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism and cysteine metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
