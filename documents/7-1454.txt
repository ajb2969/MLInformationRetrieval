Minimum energy control

In control theory, the minimum energy control is the control 
 
 
 
  that will bring a linear time invariant system to a desired state with a minimum expenditure of energy.
Let the linear time invariant (LTI) system be





 
  with initial state 
 
 
 
 . One seeks an input 
 
 
 
  so that the system will be in the state 
 
 
 
  at time 
 
 
 
 , and for any other input 
 
 
 
 , which also drives the system from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  at time 
 
 
 
  the energy expenditure would be larger



To choose this input, first compute the controllability gramian



Assuming 
 
 
 
  is nonsingular (if and only if the system is controllable), the minimum energy control is then



Substitution into the solution



verifies the achievement of state 
 
 
 
  at
