   Gibberellin 3beta-dioxygenase      Gibberellin 3beta-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a gibberellin 3beta-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   gibberellin 20 + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   gibberellin 1 + succinate + CO 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are gibberellin 20 , 2-oxoglutarate , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are gibberellin 1 , succinate , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (gibberellin-20),2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3beta-hydroxylating) . Other names in common use include gibberellin 3beta-hydroxylase , (gibberrellin-20),2-oxoglutarate: oxygen oxidoreductase , and (3beta-hydroxylating) . This enzyme participates in diterpenoid biosynthesis . It has 2 cofactors : iron , and Ascorbate .
