Jacket matrix

In mathematics, a jacket matrix is a square matrix

 
  of order n if its entries are non-zero and real, complex, or from a finite field, and 



where In is the identity matrix, and



where T denotes the transpose of the matrix.
In other words, the inverse of a jacket matrix is determined its element-wise or block-wise inverse. The definition above may also be expressed as:



The jacket matrix is a generalization of the Hadamard matrix,also it is a Diagonal block-wise inverse matrix.

Therefore, exist an element-wise inverse.
