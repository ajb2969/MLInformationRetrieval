Comparison triangle

Define 
 
 
 
  as the 2-dimensional metric space of constant curvature

 
 . So, for example, 
 
 
 
  is the Euclidean plane, 
 
 
 
  is the surface of the unit sphere, and 
 
 
 
  is the hyperbolic plane.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a metric space. Let 
 
 
 
  be a triangle in 
 
 
 
 , with vertices 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . A comparison triangle

 
  in 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  is a triangle in 
 
 
 
  with vertices 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Such a triangle is unique up to isometry.
The interior angle of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
  is called the comparison angle between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 . This is well-defined provided 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are both distinct from 
 
 
 
 .
