   Classical group      Classical group   In mathematics , the classical groups are defined as the special linear groups over the reals   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   , the complex numbers    𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   and the quaternions    𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   together with special 1  automorphism groups of symmetric or skew-symmetric  bilinear forms and Hermitian or skew-Hermitian  sesquilinear forms defined on real, complex and quaternionic finite-dimensional vector spaces. 2 Of these, the complex classical Lie groups are four infinite families of Lie groups that together with the exceptional groups exhaust the classification of simple Lie groups . The compact classical groups are compact real forms of the complex classical groups. The finite analogues of the classical groups are the classical groups of Lie type . The term "classical group" was coined by Hermann Weyl , it being the title of his 1939 monograph The Classical Groups . 3  The classical groups form the deepest and most useful part of the subject of linear Lie groups. 4 Most types of classical groups find application in classical and modern physics. A few examples are the following. The rotation group     S  O   (  3  )       S  O  3    SO(3)   is a symmetry of Euclidean space and all fundamental laws of physics, the Lorentz group     O   (  3  ,  1  )       O   3  1     O(3,1)   is a symmetry group of spacetime of special relativity . The special unitary group     S  U   (  3  )       S  U  3    SU(3)   is the symmetry group of quantum chromodynamics and the symplectic group     S  p   (  m  )       S  p  m    Sp(m)   finds application in hamiltonian mechanics and quantum mechanical versions of it.  The classical groups  The classical groups are exactly the general linear groups over    𝐑  ,  𝐂     𝐑  𝐂    \mathbf{R},\mathbf{C}   and   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   together with the automorphism groups of non-degenerate forms discussed below. 5 These groups are usually additionally restricted to the subgroups whose elements have determinant 1. The classical groups, with the determinant 1 condition, are listed in the table below. In the sequel, the determinant 1 condition is not used consistently in the interest of greater generality.

A group is complex according to whether its Lie algebra is complex. The real classical groups refers to all of the classical groups since any Lie algebra is a real algebra. The compact classical groups are the compact real forms of the complex classical groups. These are, in turn,    S  U   (  n  )       S  U  n    SU(n)   ,    S  O   (  n  )       S  O  n    SO(n)   and    S  p   (  m  )       S  p  m    Sp(m)   . One characterization of the compact real form is in terms of the Lie algebra   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   . If    𝐠  =   𝐮  +   i  𝐮        𝐠    𝐮    i  𝐮      \mathbf{g}=\mathbf{u}+i\mathbf{u}   , the complexification of   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   , then if the connected group   K   K   K   generated by     e  x  p   (  X  )    :   X  ∈  𝐮      normal-:    e  x  p  X     X  normal-∈  𝐮     exp(X):X∈\mathbf{u}   is a compact,   K   K   K   is a compact real form. 6  The classical groups can uniformly be characterized in a different way using real forms . The classical groups (here with the determinant 1 condition, but this is not necessary) are the following:   The complex linear algebraic groups      S  L   (  n  ,  𝐂  )    ,   S  O   (  n  ,  𝐂  )         S  L   n  𝐂      S  O   n  𝐂      SL(n,\mathbf{C}),SO(n,\mathbf{C})   , and    S  p   (  n  ,  𝐂  )       S  p   n  𝐂     Sp(n,\mathbf{C})   together with their real forms . 7    For instance, is a real form of    S  O   (   2  n   ,  𝐂  )       S  O     2  n   𝐂     SO(2n,\mathbf{C})   ,    S  U   (  p  ,  q  )       S  U   p  q     SU(p,q)   is a real form of    S  l   (  n  ,  𝐂  )       S  l   n  𝐂     Sl(n,\mathbf{C})   , and    S  l   (  n  ,  𝐇  )       S  l   n  𝐇     Sl(n,\mathbf{H})   is a real form of    S  O   (   2  n   ,  𝐂  )       S  O     2  n   𝐂     SO(2n,\mathbf{C})   . Without the determinant 1 condition, replace the special linear groups with the corresponding general linear groups in the characterization. The algebraic groups in question are Lie groups, but the "algebraic" qualifier is needed to get the right notion of "real form".  Bilinear and sesquilinear forms  The classical groups are defined in terms of forms defined on , , and , where   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   and   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   are the fields of the real and complex numbers . The quaternions ,   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   , do not constitute a field because multiplication does not commute; they form a division ring or a skew field or non-commutative field . However, it is still possible to define matrix quaternionic groups. For this reason, a vector space   V   V   V   is allowed to be defined over   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   ,   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   , as well as   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   below. In the case of   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   ,   V   V   V   is a right vector space to make possible the representation of the group action as matrix multiplication from the left , just as for   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   and   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   . 8  A form    φ  :   V  ×  V  →  F      normal-:  φ    V  normal-×  V  normal-→  F     φ:V×V→F   on some finite-dimensional right vector space over    F  =   𝐑  ,  𝐂       F   𝐑  𝐂     F=\mathbf{R},\mathbf{C}   , or   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   is bilinear if         φ   (   x  α   ,   y  β   )    =    α  φ   (  x  ,  y  )   β   ,   ∀  x     ,    y  ∈   V  ,   ∀  α     ,   β  ∈  F     .     formulae-sequence      φ     x  α     y  β        α  φ   x  y   β    for-all  x      formulae-sequence    y   V   for-all  α       β  F      \varphi(x\alpha,y\beta)=\alpha\varphi(x,y)\beta,\quad\forall x,y\in V,\forall%
 \alpha,\beta\in F.   It is called sesquilinear if         φ   (   x  α   ,   y  β   )    =     α  ¯   φ   (  x  ,  y  )   β   ,   ∀  x     ,    y  ∈   V  ,   ∀  α     ,   β  ∈  F     .     formulae-sequence      φ     x  α     y  β         normal-¯  α   φ   x  y   β    for-all  x      formulae-sequence    y   V   for-all  α       β  F      \varphi(x\alpha,y\beta)=\bar{\alpha}\varphi(x,y)\beta,\quad\forall x,y\in V,%
 \forall\alpha,\beta\in F.     These conventions are chosen because they work in all cases considered. An automorphism of   φ   φ   φ   is a map   Α   normal-Α   Α   in the set of linear operators on   V   V   V   such that The set of all automorphisms of   φ   φ   φ   form a group, it is called the automorphism group of   φ   φ   φ   , denoted    A  u  t   (  φ  )       A  u  t  φ    Aut(φ)   . This leads to a preliminary definition of a classical group:   A classical group is a group that preserves a bilinear or sesquilinear form on finite-dimensional vector spaces over    𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   ,   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   or   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   .   This definition has shortcomings because there is some unnecessary redundancy. In the case of    F  =  𝐑      F  𝐑    F=\mathbf{R}   , bilinear is equivalent to sesquilinear. In the case of    F  =  𝐇      F  𝐇    F=\mathbf{H}   , there are no non-zero bilinear forms. 9  Symmetric, skew-symmetric, Hermitian, and skew-Hermitian forms  A form is symmetric if        φ   (  x  ,  y  )    =   φ   (  y  ,  x  )     .        φ   x  y      φ   y  x      \varphi(x,y)=\varphi(y,x).   It is skew-symmetric if        φ   (  x  ,  y  )    =   -   φ   (  y  ,  x  )      .        φ   x  y        φ   y  x       \varphi(x,y)=-\varphi(y,x).   It is Hermitian if       φ   (  x  ,  y  )    =    φ   (  y  ,  x  )    ¯         φ   x  y     normal-¯    φ   y  x       \varphi(x,y)=\overline{\varphi(y,x)}   Finally, it is skew-Hermitian if        φ   (  x  ,  y  )    =   -    φ   (  y  ,  x  )    ¯     .        φ   x  y       normal-¯    φ   y  x        \varphi(x,y)=-\overline{\varphi(y,x)}.     A bilinear form   φ   φ   φ   is uniquely a sum of a symmetric form and a skew-symmetric form. A transformation preserving   φ   φ   φ   preserves both parts separately. The groups preserving symmetric and skew-symmetric forms can thus be studied separately. The same applies, mutatis mutandis, to Hermitian and skew-Hermitian forms. For this reason, for the purposes of classification, only purely symmetric, skew-symmetric, Hermitian, or skew-Hermitian forms are considered. The normal forms of the forms correspond to specific suitable choices of bases. These are bases giving the following normal forms in coordinates:      Bilinear symmetric form in (pseudo-)orthonormal basis:   φ   (  x  ,  y  )       Bilinear symmetric form in (pseudo-)orthonormal basis:    φ   x  y      \displaystyle\text{Bilinear symmetric form in (pseudo-)orthonormal basis:}%
 \qquad\varphi(x,y)   The   𝐣   𝐣   \mathbf{j}   in the skew-Hermitian form is the third basis element in the basis    (  𝟏  ,  𝐢  ,  𝐣  ,  𝐤  )     1  𝐢  𝐣  𝐤    (\mathbf{1},\mathbf{i},\mathbf{j},\mathbf{k})   for   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   . Proof of existence of these bases and Sylvester's law of inertia , the independence of the number of plus- and minus-signs,   p   p   p   and   q   q   q   , in the symmetric and Hermitian forms, as well as the presence or absence of the fields in each expression, can be found in  or . The pair    (  p  ,  q  )     p  q    (p,q)   , and sometimes    p  −  q      p  normal-−  q    p−q   , is called the signature of the form.  Explanation of occurrence of the fields     𝐑  ,  𝐂  ,  𝐇     𝐑  𝐂  𝐇    \mathbf{R},\mathbf{C},\mathbf{H}   : There are no nontrivial bilinear forms over   H   H   H   . In the symmetric bilinear case, only forms over   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   have a signature. In other words, a complex bilinear form with "signature"    (  p  ,  q  )     p  q    (p,q)   can, by a change of basis, be reduced to a form where all signs are "   +     +   " in the above expression, whereas this is impossible in the real case, in which    p  −  q      p  normal-−  q    p−q   is independent of the basis when put into this form. However, Hermitian forms have basis-independent signature in both the complex and the quaternionic case. (The real case reduces to the symmetric case.) A skew-Hermitian form on a complex vector space is rendered Hermitian by multiplication by   i   i   i   , so in this case, only   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   is interesting.  Automorphism groups  The first section presents the general framework. The other sections exhaust the qualitatively different cases that arise as automorphism groups of bilinear and sesquilinear forms on finite-dimensional vector spaces over   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   ,   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   and   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   .  Aut( φ ) – the automorphism group  Assume that   φ   φ   φ   is a non-degenerate form on a finite-dimensional vector space   V   V   V   over    𝐑  ,  𝐂     𝐑  𝐂    \mathbf{R},\mathbf{C}   or   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   . The automorphism group is defined, based on condition (), as        Aut   (  φ  )    =   {   A  ∈   GL   (  V  )     :     φ   (   A  u   ,   A  v   )    =    φ   (  x  ,  y  )    ,   ∀  x     ,   y  ∈  V    }    .        Aut  φ    conditional-set    A    GL  V     formulae-sequence      φ     A  u     A  v        φ   x  y     for-all  x       y  V       \mathrm{Aut}(\varphi)=\{A\in\mathrm{GL}(V):\varphi(Au,Av)=\varphi(x,y),\quad%
 \forall x,y\in V\}.     Every has an adjoint with respect to   φ   φ   φ   defined by Using this definition in condition (), the automorphism group is seen to be given by  Fix a basis for   V   V   V   . In terms of this basis, put       φ   (  x  ,  y  )    =   ∑    ξ  i    φ   i  j     η  j           φ   x  y         subscript  ξ  i    subscript  φ    i  j     subscript  η  j       \varphi(x,y)=\sum\xi_{i}\varphi_{ij}\eta_{j}   where are the components of    x  ,  y     x  y    x,y   . This is appropriate for the bilinear forms. Sesquilinear forms have similar expressions and are treated separately later. In matrix notation one finds       φ   (  x  ,  y  )    =    x  T   Φ  y         φ   x  y       superscript  x  normal-T   normal-Φ  y     \varphi(x,y)=x^{\mathrm{T}}\Phi y   and  from () where   Φ   normal-Φ   Φ   is the matrix . The non-degeneracy condition means precisely that   Φ   normal-Φ   Φ   is invertible, so the adjoint always exists.    A  u  t   (  φ  )       A  u  t  φ    Aut(φ)   expressed with this becomes        Aut   (  φ  )    =   {   A  ∈   GL   (  V  )     :     Φ   -  1     A  T   Φ  A   =  1   }    .       Aut  φ    conditional-set    A   GL  V         superscript  normal-Φ    1     superscript  A  normal-T   normal-Φ  A   1      \operatorname{Aut}(\varphi)=\{A\in\operatorname{GL}(V):\Phi^{-1}A^{\mathrm{T}}%
 \Phi A=1\}.   The Lie algebra    𝐚𝐮𝐭   (  φ  )       𝐚𝐮𝐭  φ    \mathbf{aut}(φ)   of the automorphism groups can be written down immediately. Abstractly,    X  ∈  𝐚𝐮𝐭   (  φ  )       X  normal-∈  𝐚𝐮𝐭  φ    X∈\mathbf{aut}(φ)   if and only if         (   e   t  X    )   φ    e   t  X     =  1         superscript   superscript  e    t  X    φ    superscript  e    t  X     1    (e^{tX})^{\varphi}e^{tX}=1   for all   t   t   t   , corresponding to the condition in () under the exponential mapping of Lie algebras, so that        𝔞  𝔲  𝔱   (  φ  )    =   {   X  ∈    M  n    (  V  )     :    X  φ   =   -  X    }    ,        𝔞  𝔲  𝔱  φ    conditional-set    X     subscript  M  n   V       superscript  X  φ     X       \mathfrak{aut}(\varphi)=\{X\in M_{n}(V):X^{\varphi}=-X\},   or in a basis  as is seen using the power series expansion of the exponential mapping and the linearity of the involved operations. Conversely, suppose that    X  ∈  𝐚𝐮𝐭   (  φ  )       X  normal-∈  𝐚𝐮𝐭  φ    X∈\mathbf{aut}(φ)   . Then, using the above result, φ( x , X φ y ) {{=}} -φ( x , Xy )}} . Thus the Lie algebra can be characterized without reference to a basis, or the adjoint, as        𝔞  𝔲  𝔱   (  φ  )    =   {   X  ∈    M  n    (  V  )     :     φ   (   X  x   ,  y  )    =    -   φ   (  x  ,   X  y   )     ,   ∀  x     ,   y  ∈  V    }    .        𝔞  𝔲  𝔱  φ    conditional-set    X     subscript  M  n   V     formulae-sequence      φ     X  x   y         φ   x    X  y       for-all  x       y  V       \mathfrak{aut}(\varphi)=\{X\in M_{n}(V):\varphi(Xx,y)=-\varphi(x,Xy),\quad%
 \forall x,y\in V\}.     The normal form for   φ   φ   φ   will be given for each classical group below. From that normal form, the matrix   Φ   normal-Φ   Φ   can be read off directly. Consequently, expressions for the adjoint and the Lie algebras can be obtained using formulas () and (). This is demonstrated below in most of the non-trivial cases.  Bilinear case  When the form is symmetric,    A  u  t   (  φ  )       A  u  t  φ    Aut(φ)   is called    O   (  φ  )       O  φ    O(φ)   . When it is skew-symmetric then    A  u  t   (  φ  )       A  u  t  φ    Aut(φ)   is called    S  p   (  φ  )       S  p  φ    Sp(φ)   . This applies to the real and the complex cases. The quaternionic case is empty since no nonzero bilinear forms exists on quaternionic vector spaces. 10  Real case  The real case breaks up into two cases, the symmetric and the antisymmetric forms that should be treated separately.  O( p , q ) and O( n ) – the orthogonal groups  If   φ   φ   φ   is symmetric and the vector space is real, a basis may be chosen so that        φ   (  x  ,  y  )    =    ±    ξ  1    η  1     ±    ξ  1    η  1   ⋯   ±    ξ  n    η  n      .        φ   x  y     plus-or-minus   plus-or-minus     subscript  ξ  1    subscript  η  1        subscript  ξ  1    subscript  η  1   normal-⋯      subscript  ξ  n    subscript  η  n       \varphi(x,y)=\pm\xi_{1}\eta_{1}\pm\xi_{1}\eta_{1}\cdots\pm\xi_{n}\eta_{n}.   The number of plus and minus-signs are independent of the particular basis. 11 In the case  R n }} one writes     O   (  φ  )    =   O   (  p  ,  q  )          O  φ     O   p  q      O(φ)=O(p,q)   where   p   p   p   is the number of plus signs and   q   q   q   is the number of minus-signs,     p  +  q   =  n        p  q   n    p+q=n   . If    q  =  0      q  0    q=0   the notation is    O   (  n  )       O  n    O(n)   . The matrix   Φ   normal-Φ   Φ   is in this case      Φ  =   (      I  p     0      0     -   I  q       )   ≡   I   p  ,  q          normal-Φ     subscript  I  p   0    0     subscript  I  q            subscript  I   p  q       \Phi=\left(\begin{matrix}I_{p}&0\\
 0&-I_{q}\end{matrix}\right)\equiv I_{p,q}   after reordering the basis if necessary. The adjoint operation () then becomes        A  φ   =    (      I  p     0      0     -   I  q       )     (      A  11     ⋯      ⋯     A   n  n       )   T    (      I  p     0      0     -   I  q       )     ,       superscript  A  φ        subscript  I  p   0    0     subscript  I  q       superscript     subscript  A  11   normal-⋯    normal-⋯   subscript  A    n  n      normal-T      subscript  I  p   0    0     subscript  I  q         A^{\varphi}=\left(\begin{matrix}I_{p}&0\\
 0&-I_{q}\end{matrix}\right)\left(\begin{matrix}A_{11}&\cdots\\

Complex case  Like in the real case, there are two cases, the symmetric and the antisymmetric case that each yield a family of classical groups.

For    A  u  t   (  φ  )       A  u  t  φ    Aut(φ)   one writes     S  p   (  φ  )    =   S  p   (  V  )          S  p  φ     S  p  V     Sp(φ)=Sp(V)   In case ℂ n {{=}} ℂ 2 m }} one writes    S  p   (  m  ,  ℂ  )       S  p   m  normal-ℂ     Sp(m,ℂ)   or    S  p   (   2  m   ,  ℂ  )       S  p     2  m   normal-ℂ     Sp(2m,ℂ)   .

Sesquilinear case  In the sequilinear case, one makes a slightly different ansatz for the form in terms of a basis,        φ   (  x  ,  y  )    =   ∑     ξ  ¯   i    φ   i  j     η  j      .        φ   x  y         subscript   normal-¯  ξ   i    subscript  φ    i  j     subscript  η  j       \varphi(x,y)=\sum\bar{\xi}_{i}\varphi_{ij}\eta_{j}.

The complex and the quaternionic case will be considered below.  Complex case  From a qualitative point of view, consideration of skew-Hermitean forms (up to isomorphism) provide no new groups; multiplication by   i   i   i   renders a skew-Hermitean form Hermitean, and vice versa. Thus only the Hermitian case needs to be considered.  U( p , q ) and U( n ) – the unitary groups  A non-degenerate hermitian form has the normal form        φ   (  x  ,  y  )    =    ±     ξ  1   ¯    η  1     ±     ξ  2   ¯    η  2   ⋯   ±     ξ  n   ¯    η  n      .        φ   x  y     plus-or-minus   plus-or-minus     normal-¯   subscript  ξ  1     subscript  η  1        normal-¯   subscript  ξ  2     subscript  η  2   normal-⋯      normal-¯   subscript  ξ  n     subscript  η  n       \varphi(x,y)=\pm\bar{\xi_{1}}\eta_{1}\pm\bar{\xi_{2}}\eta_{2}\cdots\pm\bar{\xi%
 _{n}}\eta_{n}.   As in the bilinear case, the signature ( p , q ) is independent of the basis. The automorphism group is denoted    U   (  V  )       U  V    U(V)   , or, in the case of  C n }} ,    U   (  p  ,  q  )       U   p  q     U(p,q)   . If    q  =  0      q  0    q=0   the notation is    U   (  n  )       U  n    U(n)   . In this case,   Φ   normal-Φ   Φ   takes the form       Φ  =   (      1  p     0      0     -   1  q       )   =   I   p  ,  q     ,        normal-Φ     subscript  1  p   0    0     subscript  1  q            subscript  I   p  q       \Phi=\left(\begin{matrix}1_{p}&0\\
 0&-1_{q}\end{matrix}\right)=I_{p,q},   and the Lie algebra is given by        𝔲   (  p  ,  q  )    =   {   (      X   p  ×  p       Z   p  ×  q          Z  ¯   T      Y   q  ×  q       )   |      X  ¯   T   =   -  X    ,     Y  ¯   T   =   -  Y     }    .        𝔲   p  q     conditional-set     subscript  X    p  p     subscript  Z    p  q       superscript   normal-¯  Z   normal-T    subscript  Y    q  q       formulae-sequence     superscript   normal-¯  X   normal-T     X       superscript   normal-¯  Y   normal-T     Y        \mathfrak{u}(p,q)=\left\{\left.\left(\begin{matrix}X_{p\times p}&Z_{p\times q}%

The group is given by        U   (  p  ,  q  )    =   {  g  |     I   p  ,  q    -  1     g  *    I   p  ,  q    g   =  I   }    .        normal-U   p  q     conditional-set  g       superscript   subscript  I   p  q      1     superscript  g     subscript  I   p  q    g   I      \mathrm{U}(p,q)=\{g|I_{p,q}^{-1}g^{*}I_{p,q}g=I\}.     Quaternionic case  The space is considered as a right vector space over   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   . This way,     A   (   v  h   )    =    (   A  v   )   h         A    v  h        A  v   h     A(vh)=(Av)h   for a quaternion   h   h   h   , a quaternion column vector   v   v   v   and quaternion matrix   A   A   A   . If was a left vector space over   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   , then matrix multiplication from the right on row vectors would be required to maintain linearity. This does not correspond to the usual linear operation of a group on a vector space when a basis is given, which is matrix multiplication from the left on column vectors. Thus   V   V   V   is henceforth a right vector space over   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   . Even so, care must be taken due to the non-commutative nature of   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   . The (mostly obvious) details are skipped because complex representations will be used.  When dealing with quaternionic groups it is convenient to represent quaternions using complex ,  With this representation, quaternionic multiplication becomes matrix multiplication and quaternionic conjugation becomes taking the Hermitian adjoint. Moreover, if a quaternion according to the complex encoding    q  =   x  +   𝐣  y        q    x    𝐣  y      q=x+\mathbf{j}y   is given as a column vector , then multiplication from the left by a matrix representation of a quaternion produces a new column vector representing the correct quaternion. This representation differs slightly from a more common representation found in the quaternion article. The more common convention would force multiplication from the right on a row matrix to achieve the same thing.  Incidentally, the representation above makes it clear that the group of unit quaternions (      α   α  ¯    +   β   β  ¯     =  1  =   d  e  t  Q             α   normal-¯  α      β   normal-¯  β     1         d  e  t  Q      α\overline{α}+β\overline{β}=1=detQ   ) is isomorphic to    S  U   (  2  )       S  U  2    SU(2)   .  Quaternionic    n  ×  n      n  normal-×  n    n×n   -matrices matrices can, by obvious extension, be represented by    2  n  ×  2  n      2  n  normal-×  2  n    2n×2n   block-matrices of complex numbers. 13 If one agrees to represent a quaternionic  column vector by a  column vector with complex numbers according to the encoding of above, with the upper   n   n   n   numbers being the and the lower   n   n   n   the , then a quaternionic    n  ×  n      n  normal-×  n    n×n   -matrix becomes a complex    2  n  ×  2  n      2  n  normal-×  2  n    2n×2n   -matrix exactly of the form given above, but now with α and β    n  ×  n      n  normal-×  n    n×n   -matrices. More formally  A matrix    T  ∈  G  L   (   2  n   ,  𝐂  )       T  normal-∈  G  L     2  n   𝐂     T∈GL(2n,\mathbf{C})   has the form displayed in () if and only if  TJ n }} . With these identifications,         ℍ  n   ≈   ℂ   2  n     ,     M  n    (  ℍ  )    ≈   {   T  ∈    M   2  n     (  ℂ  )     |      J  n   T   =    T  ¯    J  n     ,    J  n   =   (     0     I  n        -   I  n      0     )     }     .     formulae-sequence     superscript  ℍ  n    superscript  ℂ    2  n          subscript  M  n   ℍ    conditional-set    T     subscript  M    2  n    ℂ     formulae-sequence       subscript  J  n   T      normal-¯  T    subscript  J  n        subscript  J  n     0   subscript  I  n        subscript  I  n    0          \mathbb{H}^{n}\approx\mathbb{C}^{2n},M_{n}(\mathbb{H})\approx\left\{\left.T\in
 M%
 _{2n}(\mathbb{C})\right|J_{n}T=\overline{T}J_{n},\quad J_{n}=\left(\begin{%
 matrix}0&I_{n}\\
 -I_{n}&0\end{matrix}\right)\right\}.     The space is a real algebra, but it is not a complex subspace of . Multiplication (from the left) by   𝐢   𝐢   \mathbf{i}   in using entry-wise quaternionic multiplication and then mapping to the image in yields a different result than multiplying entry-wise by   i   i   i   directly in . The quaternionic multiplication rules give     𝐢   (   X  +   𝐣  Y    )    =    (   𝐢  X   )   +   𝐣   (   -   𝐢  Y    )           𝐢    X    𝐣  Y         𝐢  X     𝐣      𝐢  Y        \mathbf{i}(X+\mathbf{j}Y)=(\mathbf{i}X)+\mathbf{j}(-\mathbf{i}Y)   where the new   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   are inside the parentheses.  The action of the quaternionic matrices on quaternionic vectors is now represented by complex quantities, but otherwise it is the same as for "ordinary" matrices and vectors. The quaternionic groups are thus embedded in where   n   n   n   is the dimension of the quaternionic matrices.  The determinant of a quaternionic matrix is defined in this representation as being the ordinary complex determinant of its representative matrix. The non-commutative nature of quaternionic multiplication would, in the quaternionic representation of matrices, be ambiguous. The way is embedded in is not unique, but all such embeddings are related through for    A  ∈  O   (   2  n   ,  𝐂  )       A  normal-∈  O     2  n   𝐂     A∈O(2n,\mathbf{C})   , leaving the determinant unaffected. 14 The name of    S  L   (  n  ,  𝐇  )       S  L   n  𝐇     SL(n,\mathbf{H})   in this complex guise is .  As opposed to in the case of   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   , both the Hermitian and the skew-Hermitean case bring in something new when   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   is considered, so these cases are considered separately.

 \mathfrak{su}^{*}(2n).     Sp( p , q ) – the quaternionic unitary group  As above in the complex case, the normal form is       φ   (  x  ,  y  )    =    ±     ξ  1   ¯    η  1     ±     ξ  2   ¯    η  2   ⋯   ±     ξ  n   ¯    η  n           φ   x  y     plus-or-minus   plus-or-minus     normal-¯   subscript  ξ  1     subscript  η  1        normal-¯   subscript  ξ  2     subscript  η  2   normal-⋯      normal-¯   subscript  ξ  n     subscript  η  n       \varphi(x,y)=\pm\bar{\xi_{1}}\eta_{1}\pm\bar{\xi_{2}}\eta_{2}\cdots\pm\bar{\xi%

When  H n }} with this form,     S  p   (  φ  )    =   S  p   (  p  ,  q  )          S  p  φ     S  p   p  q      Sp(φ)=Sp(p,q)   . The reason for the notation is that the group can be represented, using the above prescription, as a subgroup of    S  p   (  n  ,  𝐂  )       S  p   n  𝐂     Sp(n,\mathbf{C})   preserving a complex-hermitian form of signature    (   2  p   ,   2  q   )       2  p     2  q     (2p,2q)    15 If   p   p   p   or    q  =  0      q  0    q=0   the group is denoted    U   (  n  ,  𝐇  )       U   n  𝐇     U(n,\mathbf{H})   . It is sometimes called the hyperunitary group .  In quaternionic notation,      Φ  =   (      I  p     0      0     -   I  q       )   =   I   p  ,  q          normal-Φ     subscript  I  p   0    0     subscript  I  q            subscript  I   p  q       \Phi=\left(\begin{matrix}I_{p}&0\\

Caution needs to be exercised when dealing with quaternionic matrix multiplication, but here only   I   I   I   and    -  I      I    -I   are involved and these commute with every quaternion matrix. Now apply prescription () to each block,        𝒳  =   (      X   1   (   p  ×  p   )        -    X  ¯   2         X  2       X  ¯   1      )    ,    𝒴  =   (      Y   1   (   q  ×  q   )        -    Y  ¯   2         Y  2       Y  ¯   1      )    ,   𝒵  =   (      Z   1   (   p  ×  q   )        -    Z  ¯   2         Z  2       Z  ¯   1      )      ,     formulae-sequence    𝒳     subscript  X    1    p  p        subscript   normal-¯  X   2       subscript  X  2    subscript   normal-¯  X   1       formulae-sequence    𝒴     subscript  Y    1    q  q        subscript   normal-¯  Y   2       subscript  Y  2    subscript   normal-¯  Y   1        𝒵     subscript  Z    1    p  q        subscript   normal-¯  Z   2       subscript  Z  2    subscript   normal-¯  Z   1         \mathcal{X}=\left(\begin{matrix}X_{1(p\times p)}&-\overline{X}_{2}\\

Both forms take purely complex values and due to the prefactor of   𝐣   𝐣   \mathbf{j}   of the second form, they are separately conserved. This means that       Sp   (  p  ,  q  )    =    U   (   ℂ   2  n    ,   φ  1   )    ∩   Sp   (   ℂ   2  n    ,   φ  2   )           Sp   p  q        normal-U    superscript  ℂ    2  n     subscript  φ  1       Sp    superscript  ℂ    2  n     subscript  φ  2        \mathrm{Sp}(p,q)=\mathrm{U}(\mathbb{C}^{2n},\varphi_{1})\cap\mathrm{Sp}(%

In this case, O ∗ (2 n )}} may be realized, using the complex matrix encoding of above, as a subgroup of    O   (   2  n   ,  𝐂  )       O     2  n   𝐂     O(2n,\mathbf{C})   which preserves a non-degenerate complex skew-hermitian form of signature    (  n  ,  n  )     n  n    (n,n)   . 17 From the normal form one sees that in quaternionic notation      Φ  =   (     𝐣    0    ⋯    0      0    𝐣    ⋯    ⋮      ⋮       ⋱            0    ⋯    0    𝐣     )   ≡   j  n         normal-Φ    𝐣  0  normal-⋯  0    0  𝐣  normal-⋯  normal-⋮    normal-⋮  absent  normal-⋱  absent  absent    0  normal-⋯  0  𝐣          subscript  normal-j  n      \Phi=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}\mathbf{j}&0&\cdots&0\\

The same prescription yields for   Φ   normal-Φ   Φ   ,       Φ  ↔    (     0     -   I  n         I  n     0     )   ≡   J  n     .     normal-↔  normal-Φ      0     subscript  I  n       subscript  I  n   0     subscript  J  n      \Phi\leftrightarrow\left(\begin{matrix}0&-I_{n}\\

 =I_{2n}\}.   The group can be characterized as         O  *    (   2  n   )    =   {   g  ∈   O   (   2  n   ,  ℂ  )     |    θ   (   g  ¯   )    =  g   }    ,         superscript  normal-O      2  n     conditional-set    g    normal-O     2  n   ℂ         θ   normal-¯  g    g      \mathrm{O}^{*}(2n)=\{g\in\mathrm{O}(2n,\mathbb{C})|\theta(\overline{g})=g\},    18 where the map    θ  :   G  L   (   2  n   ,  𝐂  )   →  G  L   (   2  n   ,  𝐂  )       normal-:  θ    G  L     2  n   𝐂   normal-→  G  L     2  n   𝐂      θ:GL(2n,\mathbf{C})→GL(2n,\mathbf{C})   is defined by . Also, the form determining the group can be viewed as a   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   -valued form on . 19 Make the substitutions and in the expression for the form. Then        φ   (  x  ,  y  )    =       w  ¯   2    I  n    z  1    -     w  ¯   1    I  n    z  2     +   𝐣   (     w  1    I  n    z  1    +    w  2    I  n    z  2     )     =      φ  1    (  w  ,  z  )    ¯   +   𝐣   φ  2    (  w  ,  z  )      .          φ   x  y           subscript   normal-¯  w   2    subscript  I  n    subscript  z  1       subscript   normal-¯  w   1    subscript  I  n    subscript  z  2       𝐣       subscript  w  1    subscript  I  n    subscript  z  1       subscript  w  2    subscript  I  n    subscript  z  2               normal-¯     subscript  φ  1    w  z       𝐣   subscript  φ  2    w  z        \varphi(x,y)=\overline{w}_{2}I_{n}z_{1}-\overline{w}_{1}I_{n}z_{2}+\mathbf{j}(%

 _{2}(w,z).   The form is Hermitian (while the first form on the left hand side is skew-Hermitian) of signature    (  n  ,  n  )     n  n    (n,n)   . The signature is made evident by a change of basis from    (  𝐞  ,  𝐟  )     𝐞  𝐟    (\mathbf{e},\mathbf{f})   to    (     (   𝐞  +   i  𝐟    )   /  √   2   ,     (   𝐞  −  i  𝐟   )   /  √   2   )           𝐞    i  𝐟    normal-√   2         𝐞  normal-−  i  𝐟   normal-√   2     ((\mathbf{e}+i\mathbf{f})/√2,(\mathbf{e}−i\mathbf{f})/√2)   where    𝐞  ,  𝐟     𝐞  𝐟    \mathbf{e},\mathbf{f}   are the first and last   n   n   n   basis vectors respectively. The second form, is symmetric positive definite. Thus, due to the factor   𝐣   𝐣   \mathbf{j}   , preserves both separately and it may be concluded that         O  *    (   2  n   )    =    O   (   2  n   ,  ℂ  )    ∩   U   (   ℂ   2  n    ,   φ  1   )      ,         superscript  normal-O      2  n        normal-O     2  n   ℂ      normal-U    superscript  ℂ    2  n     subscript  φ  1        \mathrm{O}^{*}(2n)=\mathrm{O}(2n,\mathbb{C})\cap\mathrm{U}(\mathbb{C}^{2n},%
 \varphi_{1}),   and the notation "O" is explained.  Classical groups over general fields or algebras  Classical groups, more broadly considered in algebra, provide particularly interesting matrix groups . When the field  F of coefficients of the matrix group is either real number or complex numbers, these groups are just the classical Lie groups. When the ground field is a finite field , then the classical groups are groups of Lie type . These groups play an important role in the classification of finite simple groups . Also, one may consider classical groups over a unital associative algebra  R over F ; where R = H (an algebra over reals) represents an important case. For the sake of generality the article will refer to groups over R , where R may be the ground field F itself.  Considering their abstract group theory, many linear groups have a " special " subgroup, usually consisting of the elements of determinant 1 over the ground field, and most of them have associated " projective " quotients, which are the quotients by the center of the group. For orthogonal groups in characteristic 2 "S" has a different meaning.  The word " general " in front of a group name usually means that the group is allowed to multiply some sort of form by a constant, rather than leaving it fixed. The subscript n usually indicates the dimension of the module on which the group is acting; it is a vector space if R = F . Caveat: this notation clashes somewhat with the n of Dynkin diagrams, which is the rank.  General and special linear groups  The general linear group GL n ( R ) is the group of all R -linear automorphisms of R n . There is a subgroup: the special linear group SL n ( R ), and their quotients: the projective general linear group PGL n ( R ) = GL n ( R )/Z(GL n ( R )) and the projective special linear group PSL n ( R ) = SL n ( R )/Z(SL n ( R )). The projective special linear group PSL n ( F ) over a field F is simple for n ≥ 2, except for the two cases when n = 2 and the field has order 2 or 3.  Unitary groups  The unitary group U n ( R ) is a group preserving a sesquilinear form on a module. There is a subgroup, the special unitary group SU n ( R ) and their quotients the projective unitary group PU n ( R ) = U n ( R )/Z(U n ( R )) and the projective special unitary group PSU n ( R ) = SU n ( R )/Z(SU n ( R ))  Symplectic groups  The symplectic group Sp 2 n ( R ) preserves a skew symmetric form on a module. It has a quotient, the projective symplectic group PSp 2 n ( R ). The general symplectic group GSp 2 n ( R ) consists of the automorphisms of a module multiplying a skew symmetric form by some invertible scalar. The projective symplectic group PSp 2 n ( F q ) over a finite field is simple for n ≥ 1, except for the two cases when n = 1 and the field has order 2 or 3.  Orthogonal groups  The orthogonal group O n ( R ) preserves a non-degenerate quadratic form on a module. There is a subgroup, the special orthogonal group SO n ( R ) and quotients, the projective orthogonal group PO n ( R ), and the projective special orthogonal group PSO n ( R ). In characteristic 2 the determinant is always 1, so the special orthogonal group is often defined as the subgroup of elements of Dickson invariant 1.  There is a nameless group often denoted by Ω n ( R ) consisting of the elements of the orthogonal group of elements of spinor norm 1, with corresponding subgroup and quotient groups SΩ n ( R ), PΩ n ( R ), PSΩ n ( R ). (For positive definite quadratic forms over the reals, the group Ω happens to be the same as the orthogonal group, but in general it is smaller.) There is also a double cover of Ω n ( R ), called the pin group Pin n ( R ), and it has a subgroup called the spin group Spin n ( R ). The general orthogonal group GO n ( R ) consists of the automorphisms of a module multiplying a quadratic form by some invertible scalar.  Notational conventions  Contrast with exceptional Lie groups  Contrasting with the classical Lie groups are the exceptional Lie groups , G 2 , F 4 , E 6 , E 7 , E 8 , which share their abstract properties, but not their familiarity. 20 These were only discovered around 1890 in the classification of the simple Lie algebras over the complex numbers by Wilhelm Killing and Élie Cartan .
