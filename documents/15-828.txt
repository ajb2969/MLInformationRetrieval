(2R)-3-sulfolactate dehydrogenase (NADP+)

 (2R)-3-sulfolactate dehydrogenase (NADP+) (, (R)-sulfolactate:NADP+ oxidoreductase, L-sulfolactate dehydrogenase, (R)-sulfolactate dehydrogenase, ComC) is an enzyme with system name (2R)-3-sulfolactate:NADP+ oxidoreductase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2R)-3-sulfolactate + NADP+

 
  3-sulfopyruvate + NADPH + H+


The enzyme from the bacterium Chromohalobacter salexigens can only utilize NADP+.
