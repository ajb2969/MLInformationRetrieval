   Inherent viscosity      Inherent viscosity   Inherent viscosity is the ratio of the natural logarithm of the relative viscosity to the mass concentration of the polymer . 1  Inherent viscosity is defined as 2      η   i  n  h    =    ln   η   r  e  l     c        subscript  η    i  n  h         subscript  η    r  e  l     c     \eta_{inh}=\frac{\ln\eta_{rel}}{c}     where c is the mass concentration of the polymer (g/dL) and    η   r  e  l      subscript  η    r  e  l     \eta_{rel}   is the relative viscosity, which is defined as       η   r  e  l    =   η   η  0         subscript  η    r  e  l      η   subscript  η  0      \eta_{rel}=\frac{\eta}{\eta_{0}}     where   η   η   \eta   is the viscosity of the solution and    η  0     subscript  η  0    \eta_{0}   is the viscosity of the neat solvent.  The unit of inherent viscosity is dL/g.  References    "  Category:Viscosity     ↩  ↩
