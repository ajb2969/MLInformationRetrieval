Inherent viscosity




Inherent viscosity

Inherent viscosity is the ratio of the natural logarithm of the relative viscosity to the mass concentration of the polymer.1
Inherent viscosity is defined as 2


where c is the mass concentration of the polymer (g/dL) and 
 
 
 
  is the relative viscosity, which is defined as



where 
 
 
 
  is the viscosity of the solution and 
 
 
 
  is the viscosity of the neat solvent.
The unit of inherent viscosity is dL/g.
