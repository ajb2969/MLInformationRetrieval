In mathematics, the theta operator is a differential operator defined by12



This is sometimes also called the homogeneity operator, because its eigenfunctions are the monomials in z:



In n variables the homogeneity operator is given by



As in one variable, the eigenspaces of Î¸ are the spaces of homogeneous polynomials.
