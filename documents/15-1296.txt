   Theta operator      Theta operator   In mathematics, the theta operator is a differential operator defined by 1 2      θ  =   z   d   d  z         θ    z    d    d  z       \theta=z{d\over dz}     This is sometimes also called the homogeneity operator , because its eigenfunctions are the monomials in z :        θ   (   z  k   )    =   k   z  k     ,   k  =   0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  …       formulae-sequence      θ   superscript  z  k      k   superscript  z  k       k   0  1  2  normal-…      \theta(z^{k})=kz^{k},\quad k=0,1,2,\dots     In n variables the homogeneity operator is given by       θ  =    ∑   k  =  1   n     x  k    ∂   ∂   x  k        .      θ    superscript   subscript     k  1    n      subscript  x  k         subscript  x  k         \theta=\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{k}}.     As in one variable, the eigenspaces of θ are the spaces of homogeneous polynomials .
