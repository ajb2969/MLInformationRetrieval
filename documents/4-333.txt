   Quaternionic representation      Quaternionic representation   In mathematical field of representation theory , a quaternionic representation is a representation on a complex vector space V with an invariant quaternionic structure , i.e., an antilinear  equivariant map      j  :   V  →   V       normal-:  j   normal-→  V  V     j\colon V\to V\,   which satisfies       j  2   =   -   1.         superscript  j  2     1.     j^{2}=-1.\,     Together with the imaginary unit i and the antilinear map k := ij , j equips V with the structure of a quaternionic vector space (i.e., V becomes a module over the division algebra of quaternions ). From this point of view, quaternionic representation of a group  G is a group homomorphism  φ : G → GL( V , H ), the group of invertible quaternion-linear transformations of V . In particular, a quaternionic matrix representation of g assigns a square matrix of quaternions ρ (g) to each element g of G such that ρ (e) is the identity matrix and         ρ   (   g  h   )    =   ρ   (  g  )   ρ   (  h  )   for all  g    ,   h  ∈  G    .     formulae-sequence      ρ    g  h      ρ  g  ρ  h  for all  g      h  G     \rho(gh)=\rho(g)\rho(h)\text{ for all }g,h\in G.\,     Quaternionic representations of associative and Lie algebras can be defined in a similar way.  Properties and related concepts  If V is a unitary representation and the quaternionic structure j is a unitary operator, then V admits an invariant complex symplectic form ω , and hence is a symplectic representation . This always holds if V is a representation of a compact group (e.g. a finite group ) and in this case quaternionic representations are also known as symplectic representations. Such representations, amongst irreducible representations , can be picked out by the Frobenius-Schur indicator .  Quaternionic representations are similar to real representations in that they are isomorphic to their complex conjugate representation . Here a real representation is taken to be a complex representation with an invariant real structure , i.e., an antilinear  equivariant map      j  :   V  →   V       normal-:  j   normal-→  V  V     j\colon V\to V\,     which satisfies       j  2   =   +   1.         superscript  j  2     1.     j^{2}=+1.\,     A representation which is isomorphic to its complex conjugate, but which is not a real representation, is sometimes called a pseudoreal representation .  Real and pseudoreal representations of a group G can be understood by viewing them as representations of the real group algebra  R [ G ]. Such a representation will be a direct sum of central simple R -algebras, which, by the Artin-Wedderburn theorem , must be matrix algebras over the real numbers or the quaternions. Thus a real or pseudoreal representation is a direct sum of irreducible real representations and irreducible quaternionic representations. It is real if no quaternionic representations occur in the decomposition.  Examples  A common example involves the quaternionic representation of rotations in three dimensions. Each (proper) rotation is represented by a quaternion with unit norm . There is an obvious one-dimensional quaternionic vector space, namely the space H of quaternions themselves under left multiplication. By restricting this to the unit quaternions, we obtain a quaternionic representation of the spinor group Spin(3).  This representation ρ : Spin(3) → GL(1, H ) also happens to be a unitary quaternionic representation because       ρ    (  g  )   †   ρ   (  g  )    =   𝟏         ρ   superscript  g  normal-†   ρ  g   1    \rho(g)^{\dagger}\rho(g)=\mathbf{1}\,     for all g in Spin(3).  Another unitary example is the spin representation of Spin(5). An example of a nonunitary quaternionic representation would be the two dimensional irreducible representation of Spin(5,1).  More generally, the spin representations of Spin( d ) are quaternionic when d equals 3 + 8 k , 4 + 8 k , and 5 + 8 k dimensions, where k is an integer. In physics, one often encounters the spinors of Spin( d , 1). These representations have the same type of real or quaternionic structure as the spinors of Spin( d − 1).  Among the compact real forms of the simple Lie groups, irreducible quaternionic representations only exist for the Lie groups of type A 4 k +1 , B 4 k +1 , B 4 k +2 , C k , D 4 k +2 , and E 7 .
