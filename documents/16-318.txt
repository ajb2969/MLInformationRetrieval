   Fabry gap theorem      Fabry gap theorem   In mathematics , the Fabry gap theorem is a result about the analytic continuation of complex  power series whose non-zero terms are of orders that have a certain "gap" between them. Such a power series is "badly behaved" in the sense that it cannot be extended to be an analytic function anywhere on the boundary of its disc of convergence .  The theorem may be deduced from the first main theorem of Turán's method .  Statement of the theorem  Let 0 1 2 n / n diverges to ∞. Let ( α j ) j ∈ N be a sequence of complex numbers such that the power series       f   (  z  )    =    ∑   j  ∈  𝐍      α  j    z   p  j            f  z     subscript     j  𝐍       subscript  α  j    superscript  z   subscript  p  j        f(z)=\sum_{j\in\mathbf{N}}\alpha_{j}z^{p_{j}}     has radius of convergence 1. Then the unit circle is a natural boundary for the series f .  Converse  A converse to the theorem was established by George Pólya . If lim inf p n / n is finite then there exists a power series with exponent sequence p n , radius of convergence equal to 1, but for which the unit circle is not a natural boundary.
