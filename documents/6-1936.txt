   Reed reaction      Reed reaction   The Reed reaction is a chemical reaction that utilizes light to oxidize  hydrocarbons to sulfonyl chlorides . The reaction performs via the free radicals . First, the light makes a molecule of chlorine dissociate homolytically , then a chlorine atom produced attacks the hydrocarbon chain to form hydrogen chloride what results in the formation of alkyl free radical. Then SO 2 as an electron donor bonds to the reaction center , forming an sulfonyl radical. Finally, the least one attacks another chlorine molecule to produce a sulfonyl chloride and a new chlorine atom which continues the reaction chain.

Under particular circumstances (40–80 °C) only chlorination of alkane may take place.
