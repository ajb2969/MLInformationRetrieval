   Scale factor (cosmology)      Scale factor (cosmology)   The scale factor , cosmic scale factor or sometimes the Robertson-Walker scale factor 1 parameter of the Friedmann equations is a function of time which represents the relative expansion of the universe . It relates the proper distance (which can change over time, unlike the comoving distance which is constant) between a pair of objects, e.g. two galaxy clusters, moving with the Hubble flow in an expanding or contracting FLRW universe at any arbitrary time   t   t   t   to their distance at some reference time    t  0     subscript  t  0    t_{0}   . The formula for this is:        d   (  t  )    =   a   (  t  )    d  0     ,        d  t     a  t   subscript  d  0      d(t)=a(t)d_{0},\,   where    d   (  t  )       d  t    d(t)   is the proper distance at epoch   t   t   t   ,    d  0     subscript  d  0    d_{0}   is the distance at the reference time    t  0     subscript  t  0    t_{0}   and    a   (  t  )       a  t    a(t)   is the scale factor. 2 Thus, by definition,     a   (   t  0   )    =  1        a   subscript  t  0    1    a(t_{0})=1   .  The scale factor is dimensionless, with   t   t   t   counted from the birth of the universe and    t  0     subscript  t  0    t_{0}   set to the present age of the universe     13.798  ±    0.037   Gyr      plus-or-minus  13.798    0.037  Gyr     13.798\pm 0.037\,\mathrm{Gyr}    3 giving the current value of   a   a   a   as    a   (   t  0   )       a   subscript  t  0     a(t_{0})   or   1   1   1   .  The evolution of the scale factor is a dynamical question, determined by the equations of general relativity , which are presented in the case of a locally isotropic, locally homogeneous universe by the Friedmann equations .  The Hubble parameter is defined:      H  ≡     a  ˙    (  t  )     a   (  t  )         H       normal-˙  a   t     a  t      H\equiv{\dot{a}(t)\over a(t)}     where the dot represents a time derivative . From the previous equation     d   (  t  )    =    d  0   a   (  t  )          d  t      subscript  d  0   a  t     d(t)=d_{0}a(t)   one can see that      d  ˙    (  t  )    =    d  0    a  ˙    (  t  )           normal-˙  d   t      subscript  d  0    normal-˙  a   t     \dot{d}(t)=d_{0}\dot{a}(t)   , and also that     d  0   =    d   (  t  )     a   (  t  )          subscript  d  0       d  t     a  t      d_{0}=\frac{d(t)}{a(t)}   , so combining these gives      d  ˙    (  t  )    =    d   (  t  )    a  ˙    (  t  )     a   (  t  )            normal-˙  d   t       d  t   normal-˙  a   t     a  t      \dot{d}(t)=\frac{d(t)\dot{a}(t)}{a(t)}   , and substituting the above definition of the Hubble parameter gives      d  ˙    (  t  )    =   H  d   (  t  )           normal-˙  d   t     H  d  t     \dot{d}(t)=Hd(t)   which is just Hubble's law .  Current evidence suggests that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating , which means that the second derivative of the scale factor     a  ¨    (  t  )        normal-¨  a   t    \ddot{a}(t)   is positive, or equivalently that the first derivative     a  ˙    (  t  )        normal-˙  a   t    \dot{a}(t)   is increasing over time. 4 This also implies that any given galaxy recedes from us with increasing speed over time, i.e. for that galaxy     d  ˙    (  t  )        normal-˙  d   t    \dot{d}(t)   is increasing with time. In contrast, the Hubble parameter seems to be decreasing with time, meaning that if we were to look at some fixed distance d and watch a series of different galaxies pass that distance, later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones. 5  According to the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric which is used to model the expanding universe, if at the present time we receive light from a distant object with a redshift of z , then the scale factor at the time the object originally emitted that light is     a   (  t  )    =   1   1  +  z          a  t     1    1  z      a(t)=\frac{1}{1+z}   . 6 7  See also   Cosmological principle  Lambda-CDM model  Redshift   References  External links   Relation of the scale factor with the cosmological constant and the Hubble constant   eo:Universa krusta faktoro "  Category:Physical cosmology     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?
