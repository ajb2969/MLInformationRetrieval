   Current (mathematics)      Current (mathematics)   In mathematics , more particularly in functional analysis , differential topology , and geometric measure theory , a k-current in the sense of Georges de Rham is a functional on the space of compactly supported  differential k-forms , on a smooth manifold  M . Formally currents behave like Schwartz distributions on a space of differential forms. In a geometric setting, they can represent integration over a submanifold, generalizing the Dirac delta function , or more generally even directional derivatives of delta functions ( multipoles ) spread out along subsets of M .  Definition  Let     Ω  c  m    (  M  )        superscript   subscript  normal-Ω  c   m   M    \Omega_{c}^{m}(M)   denote the space of smooth m - forms with compact support on a smooth manifold    M   M   M   . A current is a linear functional on     Ω  c  m    (  M  )        superscript   subscript  normal-Ω  c   m   M    \Omega_{c}^{m}(M)   which is continuous in the sense of distributions . Thus a linear functional      T  :     Ω  c  m    (  M  )    →  ℝ      normal-:  T   normal-→     superscript   subscript  normal-Ω  c   m   M   ℝ     T\colon\Omega_{c}^{m}(M)\to\mathbb{R}     is an m -current if it is continuous in the following sense: If a sequence    ω  k     subscript  ω  k    \omega_{k}   of smooth forms, all supported in the same compact set, is such that all derivatives of all their coefficients tend uniformly to 0 when   k   k   k   tends to infinity, then    T   (   ω  k   )       T   subscript  ω  k     T(\omega_{k})   tends to 0.  The space     𝒟  m    (  M  )        subscript  𝒟  m   M    \mathcal{D}_{m}(M)   of m -dimensional currents on   M   M   M   is a real  vector space with operations defined by          (   T  +  S   )    (  ω  )    :=    T   (  ω  )    +   S   (  ω  )      ,     (   λ  T   )    (  ω  )    :=   λ  T   (  ω  )      .     formulae-sequence   assign      T  S   ω       T  ω     S  ω      assign      λ  T   ω     λ  T  ω      (T+S)(\omega):=T(\omega)+S(\omega),\qquad(\lambda T)(\omega):=\lambda T(\omega).     Much of the theory of distributions carries over to currents with minimal adjustments. For example, one may define the support of a current    T  ∈    𝒟  m    (  M  )        T     subscript  𝒟  m   M     T\in\mathcal{D}_{m}(M)   as the complement of the biggest open set     U  ⊂  M      U  M    U\subset M   such that       T   (  ω  )    =  0        T  ω   0    T(\omega)=0   whenever    ω  ∈    Ω  c  m    (  U  )        ω     superscript   subscript  normal-Ω  c   m   U     \omega\in\Omega_{c}^{m}(U)     The linear subspace of     𝒟  m    (  M  )        subscript  𝒟  m   M    \mathcal{D}_{m}(M)   consisting of currents with support (in the sense above) that is a compact subset of   M   M   M   is denoted     ℰ  m    (  M  )        subscript  ℰ  m   M    \mathcal{E}_{m}(M)   .  Homological theory  Integration over a compact rectifiable  oriented submanifold M ( with boundary ) of dimension m defines an m -current, denoted by    [   [  M  ]   ]     delimited-[]   delimited-[]  M     [[M]]   :         [   [  M  ]   ]    (  ω  )    =    ∫  M   ω    .         delimited-[]   delimited-[]  M    ω     subscript   M   ω     [[M]](\omega)=\int_{M}\omega.\,     If the boundary ∂ M of M is rectifiable, then it too defines a current by integration, and by virtue of Stokes' theorem one has:         [   [   ∂  M   ]   ]    (  ω  )    =    ∫   ∂  M    ω   =    ∫  M    d  ω    =    [   [  M  ]   ]    (   d  ω   )     .           delimited-[]   delimited-[]    M     ω     subscript     M    ω          subscript   M     d  ω            delimited-[]   delimited-[]  M      d  ω       [[\partial M]](\omega)=\int_{\partial M}\omega=\int_{M}d\omega=[[M]](d\omega).     This relates the exterior derivative  d with the boundary operator ∂ on the homology of M .  In view of this formula we can define a boundary operator on arbitrary currents      ∂  :    𝒟   m  +  1    →   𝒟  m       normal-:    normal-→   subscript  𝒟    m  1     subscript  𝒟  m      \partial\colon\mathcal{D}_{m+1}\to\mathcal{D}_{m}     via duality with the exterior derivative by        (   ∂  T   )    (  ω  )    :=   T   (   d  ω   )       assign      T   ω     T    d  ω      (\partial T)(\omega):=T(d\omega)\,     for all compactly supported ( m −1)-forms ω.  Certain subclasses of currents which are closed uder   ∂     \partial   can be used instead of all currents to create a homology theory, which can satisfy the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms in certain cases. A classical example is the subclass of integral currents on Lipschitz neighborhood retracts.  Topology and norms  The space of currents is naturally endowed with the weak-* topology , which will be further simply called weak convergence . A sequence  T k of currents, converges to a current T if         T  k    (  ω  )    →    T   (  ω  )    ,   ∀  ω     .     normal-→     subscript  T  k   ω      T  ω    for-all  ω      T_{k}(\omega)\to T(\omega),\qquad\forall\omega.\,     It is possible to define several norms on subspaces of the space of all currents. One such norm is the mass norm . If ω is an m -form, then define its comass by        ∥  ω  ∥   :=   sup   {   |   ⟨  ω  ,  ξ  ⟩   |   :   ξ  is a unit, simple,  m  -vector   }     .     assign   norm  ω    supremum   conditional-set     ω  ξ      ξ  is a unit, simple,  m  -vector       \|\omega\|:=\sup\{|\langle\omega,\xi\rangle|\colon\xi\mbox{ is a unit, simple,%
  }m\mbox{-vector}\}.     So if ω is a simple  m -form, then its mass norm is the usual L ∞ -norm of its coefficient. The mass of a current T is then defined as        𝐌   (  T  )    :=   sup   {   T   (  ω  )    :     sup  x    ||   ω   (  x  )    ||    ≤  1   }     .     assign    𝐌  T    supremum   conditional-set    T  ω       subscript  supremum  x    norm    ω  x     1       \mathbf{M}(T):=\sup\{T(\omega)\colon\sup_{x}||\omega(x)||\leq 1\}.     The mass of a current represents the weighted area of the generalized surface. A current such that M ( T )  \mathbf F (T) := \inf \{\mathbf M(T - \partial A) + \mathbf M(A) \colon A\in\mathcal E_{m+1}\}.  Two currents are close in the mass norm if they coincide away from a small part. On the other hand, they are close in the flat norm if they coincide up to a small deformation.  Examples  Recall that        Ω  c  0    (   ℝ  n   )    ≡    C  c  ∞    (   ℝ  n   )           superscript   subscript  normal-Ω  c   0    superscript  ℝ  n       subscript   superscript  C    c    superscript  ℝ  n      \Omega_{c}^{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\equiv C^{\infty}_{c}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\,     so that the following defines a 0-current:        T   (  f  )    =   f   (  0  )     .        T  f     f  0     T(f)=f(0).\,     In particular every signed  regular  measure    μ   μ   \mu   is a 0-current:        T   (  f  )    =   ∫   f   (  x  )   d  μ   (  x  )      .        T  f       f  x  d  μ  x      T(f)=\int f(x)\,d\mu(x).     Let ( x , y , z ) be the coordinates in ℝ 3 . Then the following defines a 2-current (one of many):        T   (         a   d  x   ∧   d  y    +    b   d  y    ∧   d  z    +    c   d  x    ∧   d  z    )    =    ∫  0  1     ∫  0  1    b   (  x  ,  y  ,  0  )   d   x   d  y      .        T              a  d  x     d  y      b  d  y      d  z      c  d  x      d  z       superscript   subscript   0   1     superscript   subscript   0   1     b   x  y  0   d  x  d  y       T(a\,dx\wedge dy+b\,dy\wedge dz+c\,dx\wedge dz)=\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1}b(x,y,%
