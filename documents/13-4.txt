Template:Surface temperature/doc

Usage
This template calculates the average surface temperature of a spherical body situated at the distance r from the Sun, having geometrical albedo pv and the phase integral q:


 
 .
where Teff =54.8 K. The template should be used in the following way:
pv|q}}
,
where r is distance in AU, and pv and q are expressed as fractions. The result is expressed in K.
Example (average temperature of Quaoar). r=43.6 AU, pv=0.199 and q =0.8:
Temperature= K.
