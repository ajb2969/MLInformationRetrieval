   Template:Surface temperature/doc      Template:Surface temperature/doc   Usage  This template calculates the average surface temperature of a spherical body situated at the distance r from the Sun, having geometrical albedo p v and the phase integral q :           T   =      T  eff     (   1  -   q   p  ν     )    1  /  4      2      52  /  r      ,           T         subscript  T  eff    superscript    1    q   subscript  p  ν       1  4       2        52  r         \begin{smallmatrix}T\ =\ \frac{T_{\textrm{eff}}(1-qp_{\nu})^{1/4}}{\sqrt{2}}%
 \sqrt{52/r},\end{smallmatrix}   .  where T eff =54.8 K. The template should be used in the following way:  p v |q}}  ,  where r is distance in AU, and p v and q are expressed as fractions. The result is expressed in K.  Example (average temperature of Quaoar ). r =43.6 AU, p v =0.199 and q =0.8:  Temperature= K.  See also   "  Category:Astronomy templates
