   Quasisymmetric map      Quasisymmetric map   In mathematics , a quasisymmetric  homeomorphism between metric spaces is a map that generalizes bi-Lipschitz maps. While bi-Lipschitz maps shrink or expand the diameter of a set by no more than a multiplicative factor, quasisymmetric maps satisfy the weaker geometric property that they preserve the relative sizes of sets: if two sets A and B have diameters t and are no more than distance t apart, then the ratio of their sizes changes by no more than a multiplicative constant. These maps are also related to quasiconformal maps, since in many circumstances they are in fact equivalent. 1  Definition  Let ( X , d X ) and ( Y , d Y ) be two metric spaces . A homeomorphism  f : X → Y is said to be η-quasisymmetric if there is an increasing function η : [0, ∞) → [0, ∞) such that for any triple x , y , z of distinct points in X , we have          d  Y    (   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  y  )    )      d  Y    (   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  z  )    )     ≤   η   (     d  X    (  x  ,  y  )      d  X    (  x  ,  z  )     )     .           subscript  d  Y      f  x     f  y        subscript  d  Y      f  x     f  z        η       subscript  d  X    x  y       subscript  d  X    x  z        \frac{d_{Y}(f(x),f(y))}{d_{Y}(f(x),f(z))}\leq\eta\left(\frac{d_{X}(x,y)}{d_{X}%
 (x,z)}\right).     Basic properties   Inverses are quasisymmetric : If f : X → Y is an invertible η -quasisymmetric map as above, then its inverse map is    η  ′     superscript  η  normal-′    \eta^{\prime}   -quasisymmetric, where    η  ′     superscript  η  normal-′    \eta^{\prime}   ( t ) = 1/ η (1/ t ). Quasisymmetric maps preserve relative sizes of sets : If A and B are subsets of X and A is a subset of B , then         1   2  η   (    diam  B    diam  A    )     ≤    diam  f   (  B  )     diam  f   (  A  )     ≤   η   (    diam  B    diam  A    )     .          1    2  η      diam  B     diam  A          diam  f  B     diam  f  A           η      diam  B     diam  A        \frac{1}{2\eta(\frac{\text{diam }B}{\text{diam }A})}\leq\frac{\text{diam }f(B)%
 }{\text{diam }f(A)}\leq\eta\left(\frac{\text{diam }B}{\text{diam }A}\right).        Examples  Weakly quasisymmetric maps  A map f:X→Y is said to be H-weakly-quasisymmetric for some H > 0 if for all triples of distinct points x,y,z in X , we have       |    f   (  x  )    -   f   (  y  )     |   ≤   H   |    f   (  x  )    -   f   (  z  )     |    whenever    |   x  -  y   |    ≤   |   x  -  z   |               f  x     f  y       H        f  x     f  z     whenever      x  y              x  z       |f(x)-f(y)|\leq H|f(x)-f(z)|\;\;\;\text{ whenever }\;\;\;|x-y|\leq|x-z|     Not all weakly quasisymmetric maps are quasisymmetric. However, if X is connected and doubling , then all weakly quasisymmetric maps are quasisymmetric. The appeal of this result is that proving weak-quasisymmetry is much easier than proving quasisymmetry directly, and in many natural settings we have the luck of knowing the two are equivalent.  δ-monotone maps  A monotone map  f : H → H on a Hilbert space  H is δ-monotone if for all x and y in H ,        ⟨    f   (  x  )    -   f   (  y  )     ,   x  -  y   ⟩   ≥    δ   |    f   (  x  )    -   f   (  y  )     |    ⋅   |   x  -  y   |     .           f  x     f  y      x  y     normal-⋅    δ        f  x     f  y          x  y       \langle f(x)-f(y),x-y\rangle\geq\delta|f(x)-f(y)|\cdot|x-y|.     To grasp what this condition means geometrically, suppose f (0) = 0 and consider the above estimate when y = 0. Then it implies that the angle between the vector x and its image f ( x ) stays between 0 and arccos δ   Quasisymmetric maps and doubling measures  The real line  Quasisymmetric homeomorphisms of the real line to itself can be characterized in terms of their derivatives. 2 An increasing homeomorphism f :ℝ → ℝ is quasisymmetric if and only if there is a constant C > 0 and a doubling measure  μ on the real line such that        f   (  x  )    =   C  +     ∫  0  x     d  μ   (  t  )       .        f  x     C    superscript   subscript   0   x     d  μ  t       f(x)=C+\int_{0}^{x}\,d\mu(t).     Euclidean space  An analogous result holds in Euclidean space. Suppose C = 0 and we rewrite the above equation for f as        f   (  x  )    =    1  2     ∫  ℝ     (     x  -  t    |   x  -  t   |    +   t   |  t  |     )   d  μ   (  t  )       .        f  x       1  2     subscript   ℝ           x  t       x  t       t    t     d  μ  t       f(x)=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left(\frac{x-t}{|x-t|}+\frac{t}{|t|}\right)d%
 \mu(t).     Writing it this way, we can attempt to define a map using this same integral, but instead integrate (what is now a vector valued integrand) over ℝ n : if μ is a doubling measure on ℝ n and        ∫    |  x  |   >  1       1   |  x  |     d  μ   (  x  )     <  ∞        subscript       x   1        1    x    d  μ  x       \int_{|x|>1}\frac{1}{|x|}\,d\mu(x)<\infty   then the map       f   (  x  )    =    1  2     ∫   ℝ  n      (     x  -  y    |   x  -  y   |    +   y   |  y  |     )   d  μ   (  y  )            f  x       1  2     subscript    superscript  ℝ  n            x  y       x  y       y    y     d  μ  y       f(x)=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\left(\frac{x-y}{|x-y|}+\frac{y}{|y|}%
 \right)\,d\mu(y)   is quasisymmetric (in fact, it is δ -monotone for some δ depending on the measure μ ). 3  Quasisymmetry and quasiconformality in Euclidean space  Let Ω and Ω´ be open subsets of ℝ n . If f : Ω → Ω´ is η -quasisymmetric, then it is also K - quasiconformal , where K > 0 is a constant depending on η .  Conversely, if f : Ω → Ω´ is K -quasiconformal and B ( x , 2 r ) is contained in Ω , then f is η -quasisymmetric on B ( x , r ), where η depends only on K .
