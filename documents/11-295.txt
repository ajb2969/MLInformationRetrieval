   Dirichlet's energy      Dirichlet's energy   In mathematics , the Dirichlet's energy is a measure of how variable a function is. More abstractly, it is a quadratic  functional on the Sobolev space  . The Dirichlet energy is intimately connected to Laplace's equation and is named after the German mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet .  Definition  Given an open set  and function the Dirichlet's energy of the function is the real number        E   [  u  ]    =    1  2     ∫  Ω       ∥    ∇  u    (  x  )    ∥   2    d  V      ,        E   delimited-[]  u        1  2     subscript   normal-Ω      superscript   norm     normal-∇  u   x    2   normal-d  V       E[u]=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega}\|\nabla u(x)\|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}V,     where denotes the gradient  vector field of the function .  Properties and applications  Since it is the integral of a non-negative quantity, the Dirichlet's energy is itself non-negative, i.e. E[ u ] ≥ 0 for every function .  Solving Laplace's equation       -   Δ  u   (  x  )     =   0  for all  x   ∈  Ω            normal-Δ  u  x      0  for all  x        normal-Ω     -\Delta u(x)=0\text{ for all }x\in\Omega     (subject to appropriate boundary conditions ) is equivalent to solving the variational problem of finding a function that satisfies the boundary conditions and has minimal Dirichlet energy.  Such a solution is called a harmonic function and such solutions are the topic of study in potential theory .
