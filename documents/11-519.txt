Multiple inositol-polyphosphate phosphatase

In enzymology, a multiple inositol-polyphosphate phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

myo-inositol hexakisphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  myo-inositol pentakisphosphate (mixed isomers) + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are myo-inositol hexakisphosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are myo-inositol pentakisphosphate and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1D-myo-inositol-hexakisphosphate 5-phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include inositol (1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate 3-phosphatase, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate 3-phosphomonoesterase, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate-5-phosphomonoesterase, inositol tetrakisphosphate phosphomonoesterase, inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate 3-phosphatase, and MIPP. This enzyme participates in inositol phosphate metabolism.
