   Non-wellfounded mereology      Non-wellfounded mereology   In philosophy , specifically metaphysics , mereology is the study of parthood relationships. In mathematics and formal logic , wellfoundedness prohibits $\cdots for anyÂ ''x''.
 
 Thus '''non-wellfounded mereology''' treats [[topology|topologically]] circular, cyclical, repetitive, or other eventual self-containment.
 
 More formally, non-wellfounded [[partial order]]s may exhibit \cdots for some ''x'' whereas well-founded orders prohibit that.
