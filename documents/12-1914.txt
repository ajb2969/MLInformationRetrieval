Template:Gr/doc

Usage
This template calculates surface gravity g of a spherical body of the mass M and radius R:


 
 .
G is the gravitational constant. The template should be used in the following way:
{{Gr|M|R|PRE}},
where M is body's mass in 1021 kg, R is radius in km and PRE is the number of digits after decimal dot in the result (default is 3). The result is expressed in m/s2.
Example (escape velocity of Titania): M=3.526 kg, R=788.9 km.
g= m/s2.
