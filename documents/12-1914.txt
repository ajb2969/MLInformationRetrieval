   Template:Gr/doc      Template:Gr/doc   Usage  This template calculates surface gravity g of a spherical body of the mass M and radius R:      g  =    G  *  M    R  2        g      G  M    superscript  R  2      g=\frac{G*M}{R^{2}}   .  G is the gravitational constant . The template should be used in the following way:  {{Gr|M|R|PRE}},  where M is body's mass in 10 21 kg, R is radius in km and PRE is the number of digits after decimal dot in the result (default is 3). The result is expressed in m/s 2 .  Example (escape velocity of Titania ): M=3.526 kg, R=788.9 km.  g= m/s 2 .  See also    — computes escape velocity.    "
