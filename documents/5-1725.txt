   Lorentz scalar      Lorentz scalar   In physics , a Lorentz scalar is a scalar which is invariant under a Lorentz transformation . A Lorentz scalar may be generated from multiplication of vectors or tensors. While the components of vectors and tensors are in general altered by Lorentz transformations, scalars remain unchanged.  A Lorentz scalar is not necessarily a scalar in the strict sense of being a (0,0)- tensor , that is, invariant under any base transformation. For example, the determinant of the matrix of base vectors is a number that is invariant under Lorentz transformations, but it is not invariant under any base transformation.  Simple scalars in special relativity  The length of a position vector  In special relativity the location of a particle in 4-dimensional spacetime is given by       x  μ   =   (   c  t   ,  𝐱  )        superscript  x  μ      c  t   𝐱     x^{\mu}=(ct,\mathbf{x})     where    𝐱  =   𝐯  t       𝐱    𝐯  t     \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{v}t   is the position in 3-dimensional space of the particle,   𝐯   𝐯   \mathbf{v}   is the velocity in 3-dimensional space and   c   c   c   is the speed of light .  The "length" of the vector is a Lorentz scalar and is given by        x  μ    x  μ    =    η   μ  ν     x  μ    x  ν    =     (   c  t   )   2   -   𝐱  ⋅   𝐱       =  def      (   c  τ   )   2            subscript  x  μ    superscript  x  μ       subscript  η    μ  ν     superscript  x  μ    superscript  x  ν            superscript    c  t   2    normal-⋅  𝐱  𝐱       superscript   def      superscript    c  τ   2      x_{\mu}x^{\mu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}x^{\mu}x^{\nu}=(ct)^{2}-\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{x}%
 \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ (c\tau)^{2}     where   τ   τ   \tau   is the proper time as measured by a clock in the rest frame of the particle and the Minkowski metric is given by       η   μ  ν    =   η   μ  ν    =   (     1    0    0    0      0     -  1     0    0      0    0     -  1     0      0    0    0     -  1      )          superscript  η    μ  ν     subscript  η    μ  ν           1  0  0  0    0    1   0  0    0  0    1   0    0  0  0    1        \eta^{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0\\
 0&-1&0&0\\
 0&0&-1&0\\
 0&0&0&-1\end{pmatrix}   .  This is a time-like metric.  Often the alternate signature of the Minkowski metric is used in which the signs of the ones are reversed.       η   μ  ν    =   η   μ  ν    =   (      -  1     0    0    0      0    1    0    0      0    0    1    0      0    0    0    1     )          superscript  η    μ  ν     subscript  η    μ  ν             1   0  0  0    0  1  0  0    0  0  1  0    0  0  0  1       \eta^{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}=\begin{pmatrix}-1&0&0&0\\
 0&1&0&0\\
 0&0&1&0\\
 0&0&0&1\end{pmatrix}   .  This is a space-like metric.  In the Minkowski metric the space-like interval   s   s   s   is defined as        x  μ    x  μ    =    η   μ  ν     x  μ    x  ν    =    𝐱  ⋅  𝐱   -     (   c  t   )   2       =  def     s  2            subscript  x  μ    superscript  x  μ       subscript  η    μ  ν     superscript  x  μ    superscript  x  ν            normal-⋅  𝐱  𝐱    superscript    c  t   2       superscript   def      superscript  s  2      x_{\mu}x^{\mu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}x^{\mu}x^{\nu}=\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{x}-(ct)^{2}%

The length of a velocity vector  (Figure)  The velocity vectors in spacetime for a particle at two different speeds. In relativity an acceleration is equivalent to a rotation in spacetime   The velocity in spacetime is defined as        v  μ      =  def      d   x  μ     d  τ    =   (   c    d  t    d  τ     ,     d  t    d  τ      d  𝐱    d  t     )   =   (   γ  c   ,   γ  𝐯   )   =   γ   (  c  ,  𝐯  )          superscript   def    superscript  v  μ       d   superscript  x  μ      d  τ            c      d  t     d  τ           d  t     d  τ        d  𝐱     d  t              γ  c     γ  𝐯           γ   c  𝐯       v^{\mu}\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ {dx^{\mu}\over d\tau}=\left(c{dt\over d%
 \tau},{dt\over d\tau}{d\mathbf{x}\over dt}\right)=\left(\gamma c,\gamma{%
 \mathbf{v}}\right)=\gamma\left(c,{\mathbf{v}}\right)     where       γ     =  def     1    1  -    𝐯  ⋅  𝐯    c  2           superscript   def   γ    1      1     normal-⋅  𝐯  𝐯    superscript  c  2         \gamma\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ {1\over{\sqrt{1-{{\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{v%
 }}\over c^{2}}}}}   .  The magnitude of the 4-velocity is a Lorentz scalar,        v  μ    v  μ    =   -    c  2            subscript  v  μ    superscript  v  μ       superscript  c  2      v_{\mu}v^{\mu}=-c^{2}\,   .  Hence, c is a Lorentz scalar.  The inner product of acceleration and velocity  The 4-acceleration is given by        a  μ      =  def      d   v  μ     d  τ        superscript   def    superscript  a  μ       d   superscript  v  μ      d  τ      a^{\mu}\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ {dv^{\mu}\over d\tau}   .  The 4-acceleration is always perpendicular to the 4-velocity      0  =    1  2    d   d  τ     (    v  μ    v  μ    )    =     d   v  μ     d  τ     v  μ    =    a  μ    v  μ          0      1  2     d    d  τ       subscript  v  μ    superscript  v  μ                d   subscript  v  μ      d  τ     superscript  v  μ            subscript  a  μ    superscript  v  μ       0={1\over 2}{d\over d\tau}\left(v_{\mu}v^{\mu}\right)={dv_{\mu}\over d\tau}v^{%
 \mu}=a_{\mu}v^{\mu}   .  Therefore, we can regard acceleration in spacetime as simply a rotation of the 4-velocity. The inner product of the acceleration and the velocity is a Lorentz scalar and is zero. This rotation is simply an expression of energy conservation:        d  E    d  τ    =   𝐅  ⋅  𝐯           d  E     d  τ     normal-⋅  𝐅  𝐯     {dE\over d\tau}=\mathbf{F}\cdot{\mathbf{v}}     where   E   E   E   is the energy of a particle and   𝐅   𝐅   \mathbf{F}   is the 3-force on the particle.  Energy, rest mass, 3-momentum, and 3-speed from 4-momentum  The 4-momentum of a particle is       p  μ   =   m   v  μ    =   (   γ  m  c   ,   γ  m  𝐯   )   =   (   γ  m  c   ,  𝐩  )   =   (   E  c   ,  𝐩  )          superscript  p  μ     m   superscript  v  μ            γ  m  c     γ  m  𝐯            γ  m  c   𝐩           E  c   𝐩      p^{\mu}=mv^{\mu}=\left(\gamma mc,\gamma{m\mathbf{v}}\right)=\left(\gamma mc,{%
 \mathbf{p}}\right)=\left({E\over c},{\mathbf{p}}\right)     where   m   m   m   is the particle rest mass,   𝐩   𝐩   \mathbf{p}   is the momentum in 3-space, and      E  =   γ  m    c  2         E    γ  m   superscript  c  2      E=\gamma mc^{2}\,     is the energy of the particle.  Measurement of the energy of a particle  Consider a second particle with 4-velocity   u   u   u   and a 3-velocity    𝐮  2     subscript  𝐮  2    \mathbf{u}_{2}   . In the rest frame of the second particle the inner product of   u   u   u   with   p   p   p   is proportional to the energy of the first particle        p  μ    u  μ    =   -   E  1           subscript  p  μ    superscript  u  μ       subscript  E  1      p_{\mu}u^{\mu}=-{E_{1}}     where the subscript 1 indicates the first particle.  Since the relationship is true in the rest frame of the second particle, it is true in any reference frame.    E  1     subscript  E  1    E_{1}   , the energy of the first particle in the frame of the second particle, is a Lorentz scalar. Therefore       E  1   =     γ  1    γ  2    m  1    c  2    -     γ  2    𝐩  1    ⋅   𝐮  2          subscript  E  1        subscript  γ  1    subscript  γ  2    subscript  m  1    superscript  c  2     normal-⋅     subscript  γ  2    subscript  𝐩  1     subscript  𝐮  2       {E_{1}}=\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}m_{1}c^{2}-\gamma_{2}\mathbf{p}_{1}\cdot\mathbf{u}%
 _{2}     in any inertial reference frame, where    E  1     subscript  E  1    E_{1}   is still the energy of the first particle in the frame of the second particle .  Measurement of the rest mass of the particle  In the rest frame of the particle the inner product of the momentum is        p  μ    p  μ    =   -     (   m  c   )   2            subscript  p  μ    superscript  p  μ       superscript    m  c   2      p_{\mu}p^{\mu}=-(mc)^{2}\,   .  Therefore the rest mass (m) is a Lorentz scalar. The relationship remains true independent of the frame in which the inner product is calculated. In many cases the rest mass is written as    m  0     subscript  m  0    m_{0}   to avoid confusion with the relativistic mass, which is    γ   m  0       γ   subscript  m  0     \gamma m_{0}     Measurement of the 3-momentum of the particle  Note that         (     p  μ    u  μ    /  c   )   2   +    p  μ    p  μ     =     E  1  2    c  2    -    (   m  c   )   2    =    (    γ  1  2   -  1   )     (   m  c   )   2    =      γ  1  2    𝐯  1    ⋅   𝐯  1     m  2    =    𝐩  1   ⋅   𝐩  1             superscript       subscript  p  μ    superscript  u  μ    c   2      subscript  p  μ    superscript  p  μ          superscript   subscript  E  1   2    superscript  c  2     superscript    m  c   2              superscript   subscript  γ  1   2   1    superscript    m  c   2            normal-⋅     superscript   subscript  γ  1   2    subscript  𝐯  1     subscript  𝐯  1     superscript  m  2          normal-⋅   subscript  𝐩  1    subscript  𝐩  1       \left(p_{\mu}u^{\mu}/c\right)^{2}+p_{\mu}p^{\mu}={E_{1}^{2}\over c^{2}}-(mc)^{%
 2}=\left(\gamma_{1}^{2}-1\right)(mc)^{2}=\gamma_{1}^{2}{{\mathbf{v}_{1}\cdot%
 \mathbf{v}_{1}}}m^{2}=\mathbf{p}_{1}\cdot\mathbf{p}_{1}   .  The square of the magnitude of the 3-momentum of the particle as measured in the frame of the second particle is a Lorentz scalar.  Measurement of the 3-speed of the particle  The 3-speed, in the frame of the second particle, can be constructed from two Lorentz scalars       v  1  2   =    𝐯  1   ⋅   𝐯  1    =      𝐩  1   ⋅   𝐩  1     c  4     E  1  2           superscript   subscript  v  1   2    normal-⋅   subscript  𝐯  1    subscript  𝐯  1              normal-⋅   subscript  𝐩  1    subscript  𝐩  1     superscript  c  4     superscript   subscript  E  1   2       v_{1}^{2}=\mathbf{v}_{1}\cdot\mathbf{v}_{1}={{\mathbf{p}_{1}\cdot\mathbf{p}_{1%
 }c^{4}}\over{E_{1}^{2}}}   .  More complicated scalars  Scalars may also be constructed from the tensors and vectors, from the contraction of tensors, or combinations of contractions of tensors and vectors.
