Compact convergence

In mathematics compact convergence (or uniform convergence on compact sets) is a type of convergence which generalizes the idea of uniform convergence. It is associated with the compact-open topology.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a topological space and 
 
 
 
  be a metric space. A sequence of functions


 
 , 
 
 

is said to converge compactly as 
 
 
 
  to some function 
 
 
 
  if, for every compact set

 
 ,



converges uniformly on 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 . This means that for all compact 
 
 
 
 ,



Examples

If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with their usual topologies, with 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  converges compactly to the constant function with value 0, but not uniformly.


If 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  converges pointwise to the function that is zero on 
 
 
 
  and one at 
 
 
 
 , but the sequence does not converge compactly.


A very powerful tool for showing compact convergence is the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem. There are several versions of this theorem, roughly speaking it states that every sequence of equicontinuous and uniformly bounded maps has a subsequence which converges compactly to some continuous map.

Properties

If 
 
 
 
  uniformly, then 
 
 
 
  compactly.
If 
 
 
 
  is a compact space and 
 
 
 
  compactly, then 
 
 
 
  uniformly.
If 
 
 
 
  is locally compact, then 
 
 
 
  compactly if and only if 
 
 
 
  locally uniformly.
If 
 
 
 
  is a compactly generated space, 
 
 
 
  compactly, and each 
 
 
 
  is continuous, then 
 
 
 
  is continuous.
