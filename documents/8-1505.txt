   Compact convergence      Compact convergence   In mathematics  compact convergence (or uniform convergence on compact sets ) is a type of convergence which generalizes the idea of uniform convergence . It is associated with the compact-open topology .  Definition  Let    (  X  ,  𝒯  )     X  𝒯    (X,\mathcal{T})   be a topological space and    (  Y  ,   d  Y   )     Y   subscript  d  Y     (Y,d_{Y})   be a metric space . A sequence of functions       f  n   :   X  →  Y      normal-:   subscript  f  n    normal-→  X  Y     f_{n}:X\to Y   ,     n  ∈  ℕ   ,      n  ℕ    n\in\mathbb{N},     is said to converge compactly as    n  →  ∞     normal-→  n     n\to\infty   to some function    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   if, for every compact set     K  ⊆  X      K  X    K\subseteq X   ,         (   f  n   )   |   K   →    f  |   K      normal-→   evaluated-at   subscript  f  n   K    evaluated-at  f  K     (f_{n})|_{K}\to f|_{K}     converges uniformly on   K   K   K   as    n  →  ∞     normal-→  n     n\to\infty   . This means that for all compact    K  ⊆  X      K  X    K\subseteq X   ,        lim   n  →  ∞      sup   x  ∈  K      d  Y    (    f  n    (  x  )    ,   f   (  x  )    )      =  0.        subscript    normal-→  n       subscript  supremum    x  K       subscript  d  Y       subscript  f  n   x     f  x       0.    \lim_{n\to\infty}\sup_{x\in K}d_{Y}\left(f_{n}(x),f(x)\right)=0.     Examples   If    X  =   (  0  ,  1  )   ⊂  ℝ        X   0  1        ℝ     X=(0,1)\subset\mathbb{R}   and    Y  =  ℝ      Y  ℝ    Y=\mathbb{R}   with their usual topologies, with      f  n    (  x  )    :=   x  n      assign     subscript  f  n   x    superscript  x  n     f_{n}(x):=x^{n}   , then    f  n     subscript  f  n    f_{n}   converges compactly to the constant function with value 0, but not uniformly.    If    X  =   (  0  ,  1  ]       X   0  1     X=(0,1]   ,    Y  =   \R       Y  \R    Y=\R   and      f  n    (  x  )    =   x  n          subscript  f  n   x    superscript  x  n     f_{n}(x)=x^{n}   , then    f  n     subscript  f  n    f_{n}   converges pointwise to the function that is zero on    (  0  ,  1  )     0  1    (0,1)   and one at   1   1   1   , but the sequence does not converge compactly.    A very powerful tool for showing compact convergence is the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem . There are several versions of this theorem, roughly speaking it states that every sequence of equicontinuous and uniformly bounded maps has a subsequence which converges compactly to some continuous map.   Properties   If     f  n   →  f     normal-→   subscript  f  n   f    f_{n}\to f   uniformly, then     f  n   →  f     normal-→   subscript  f  n   f    f_{n}\to f   compactly.  If    (  X  ,  𝒯  )     X  𝒯    (X,\mathcal{T})   is a compact space and     f  n   →  f     normal-→   subscript  f  n   f    f_{n}\to f   compactly, then     f  n   →  f     normal-→   subscript  f  n   f    f_{n}\to f   uniformly.  If    (  X  ,  𝒯  )     X  𝒯    (X,\mathcal{T})   is locally compact , then     f  n   →  f     normal-→   subscript  f  n   f    f_{n}\to f   compactly if and only if     f  n   →  f     normal-→   subscript  f  n   f    f_{n}\to f   locally uniformly.  If    (  X  ,  𝒯  )     X  𝒯    (X,\mathcal{T})   is a compactly generated space ,     f  n   →  f     normal-→   subscript  f  n   f    f_{n}\to f   compactly, and each    f  n     subscript  f  n    f_{n}   is continuous , then   f   f   f   is continuous.
