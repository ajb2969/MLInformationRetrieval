   Damping matrix      Damping matrix   In applied mathematics , a damping matrix is a matrix corresponding to any of certain systems of linear ordinary differential equations.  A damping matrix is defined as follows. If the system has n  degrees of freedom  u n and is under application of m  damping  forces .  Each force can be expressed as follows:       f   D  i    =     c   i  1      u  1   ˙    +    c   i  2      u  2   ˙    +  ⋯  +    c   i  n      u  n   ˙     =    ∑   j  =  1   n     c   i  ,  j       u  j   ˙             subscript  f    D  i         subscript  c    i  1     normal-˙   subscript  u  1        subscript  c    i  2     normal-˙   subscript  u  2     normal-⋯     subscript  c    i  n     normal-˙   subscript  u  n             superscript   subscript     j  1    n      subscript  c   i  j     normal-˙   subscript  u  j         f_{Di}=c_{i1}\dot{u_{1}}+c_{i2}\dot{u_{2}}+\cdots+c_{in}\dot{u_{n}}=\sum_{j=1}%
