Damping matrix

In applied mathematics, a damping matrix is a matrix corresponding to any of certain systems of linear ordinary differential equations.
A damping matrix is defined as follows. If the system has n degrees of freedom un and is under application of m damping forces.
Each force can be expressed as follows:



It yields in matrix form;



where C is the damping matrix composed by the damping coefficients:
