   Bounded inverse theorem      Bounded inverse theorem   In mathematics , the bounded inverse theorem (or inverse mapping theorem ) is a result in the theory of bounded linear operators on Banach spaces . It states that a bijective bounded linear operator T from one Banach space to another has bounded inverse  T −1 . It is equivalent to both the open mapping theorem and the closed graph theorem .  It is necessary that the spaces in question be Banach spaces. For example, consider the space X of sequences  x : N → R with only finitely many non-zero terms equipped with the supremum norm . The map T : X → X defined by       T  x   =   (   x  1   ,    x  2   2   ,    x  3   3   ,  …  )         T  x     subscript  x  1      subscript  x  2   2      subscript  x  3   3   normal-…     Tx=\left(x_{1},\frac{x_{2}}{2},\frac{x_{3}}{3},\dots\right)     is bounded, linear and invertible, but T −1 is unbounded. This does not contradict the bounded inverse theorem since X is not complete , and thus is not a Banach space. To see that it's not complete, consider the sequence of sequences x ( n ) ∈ X given by       x   (  n  )    =   (  1  ,   1  2   ,  …  ,   1  n   ,  0  ,  0  ,  …  )        superscript  x  n    1    1  2   normal-…    1  n   0  0  normal-…     x^{(n)}=\left(1,\frac{1}{2},\dots,\frac{1}{n},0,0,\dots\right)     converges as n → ∞ to the sequence x (∞) given by        x   (  ∞  )    =   (  1  ,   1  2   ,  …  ,   1  n   ,  …  )    ,       superscript  x     1    1  2   normal-…    1  n   normal-…     x^{(\infty)}=\left(1,\frac{1}{2},\dots,\frac{1}{n},\dots\right),     which has all its terms non-zero, and so does not lie in X .  The completion of X is the space    c  0     subscript  c  0    c_{0}   of all sequences that converge to zero, which is a (closed) subspace of the ℓ p space ℓ ∞ ( N ), which is the space of all bounded sequences. However, in this case, the map T is not onto, and thus not a bijection. To see this, one need simply note that the sequence       x  =   (  1  ,   1  2   ,   1  3   ,  …  )    ,      x   1    1  2     1  3   normal-…     x=\left(1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\dots\right),     is an element of    c  0     subscript  c  0    c_{0}   , but is not in the range of    T  :    c  0   →   c  0       normal-:  T   normal-→   subscript  c  0    subscript  c  0      T:c_{0}\to c_{0}   .
