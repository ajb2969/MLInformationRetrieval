   Bianchi classification      Bianchi classification   In mathematics , the Bianchi classification , named for Luigi Bianchi , is a classification of Lie algebras .  The system classifies 3-dimensional real Lie algebras into 11 classes, 9 of which are single groups and two of which have a continuum of isomorphism classes. (Sometimes two of the groups are included in the infinite families, giving 9 instead of 11 classes.)  Dimension 0  The only Lie algebra is the abelian Lie algebra  R 0 .  Dimension 1  The only Lie algebra is the abelian Lie algebra R 1 , with outer automorphism group the group of non-zero real numbers.  Dimension 2  There are two Lie algebras:   The abelian Lie algebra R 2 , with outer automorphism group GL 2 ( R ).  The solvable Lie algebra of 2×2 upper triangular matrices of trace 0. The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group of order 2.   Dimension 3  All the 3-dimensional Lie algebras other than types VIII and IX can be constructed as a semidirect product of R 2 and R , with R acting on R 2 by some 2 by 2 matrix M . The different types correspond to different types of matrices M , as described below.   Type I : This is the abelian and unimodular Lie algebra R 3 . The simply connected group has center R 3 and outer automorphism group GL 3 ( R ). This is the case when M is 0.  Type II : Nilpotent and unimodular: Heisenberg algebra . The simply connected group has center R and outer automorphism group GL 2 ( R ). This is the case when M is nilpotent but not 0 (eigenvalues all 0).  Type III : Solvable and not unimodular. This algebra is a product of R and the 2-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebra. (It is a limiting case of type VI, where one eigenvalue becomes zero.) The simply connected group has center R and outer automorphism group the group of non-zero real numbers. The matrix M has one zero and one non-zero eigenvalue.  Type IV : Solvable and not unimodular. [ y , z ] = 0, [ x , y ] = y , [ x , z ] = y + z . The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group the product of the reals and a group of order 2. The matrix M has two equal non-zero eigenvalues, but is not semisimple.  Type V : Solvable and not unimodular. [ y , z ] = 0, [ x , y ] = y , [ x , z ] = z . (A limiting case of type VI where both eigenvalues are equal.) The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group the elements of GL 2 ( R ) of determinant +1 or −1. The matrix M has two equal eigenvalues, and is semisimple.  Type VI : Solvable and not unimodular. An infinite family. Semidirect products of R 2 by R , where the matrix M has non-zero distinct real eigenvalues with non-zero sum. The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group a product of the non-zero real numbers and a group of order 2.  Type VI 0 : Solvable and unimodular. This Lie algebra is the semidirect product of R 2 by R , with R where the matrix M has non-zero distinct real eigenvalues with zero sum. It is the Lie algebra of the group of isometries of the hyperbolic plane . The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group the product of the positive real numbers with the dihedral group of order 8.  Type VII : Solvable and not unimodular. An infinite family. Semidirect products of R 2 by R , where the matrix M has non-real and non-imaginary eigenvalues. The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group the non-zero reals.  Type VII 0 : Solvable and unimodular. Semidirect products of R 2 by R , where the matrix M has non-zero imaginary eigenvalues. This is the Lie algebra of the group of isometries of the plane. The simply connected group has center Z and outer automorphism group a product of the non-zero real numbers and a group of order 2.  Type VIII : Semisimple and unimodular. The Lie algebra sl 2 ( R ) of traceless 2 by 2 matrices. The simply connected group has center Z and its outer automorphism group has order 2.  Type IX : Semisimple and unimodular. The Lie algebra of the orthogonal group O 3 ( R ). The simply connected group has center of order 2 and trivial outer automorphism group, and is a spin group .   The classification of 3-dimensional complex Lie algebras is similar except that types VIII and IX become isomorphic, and types VI and VII both become part of a single family of Lie algebras.  The connected 3-dimensional Lie groups can be classified as follows: they are a quotient of the corresponding simply connected Lie group by a discrete subgroup of the center, so can be read off from the table above.  The groups are related to the 8 geometries of Thurston's geometrization conjecture . More precisely, seven of the 8 geometries can be realized as a left-invariant metric on the simply connected group (sometimes in more than one way). The Thurston geometry of type S 2 ''× R cannot be realized in this way.  Structure constants  The three-dimensional Bianchi spaces each admit a set of three Killing vectors     ξ  i   (  a  )      subscript   superscript  ξ  a   i    \xi^{(a)}_{i}   which obey the following property:        (     ∂   ξ  i   (  c  )      ∂   x  k     -    ∂   ξ  k   (  c  )      ∂   x  i      )    ξ   (  a  )   i    ξ   (  b  )   k    =   C    a   b   c                subscript   superscript  ξ  c   i       superscript  x  k          subscript   superscript  ξ  c   k       superscript  x  i       subscript   superscript  ξ  i   a    subscript   superscript  ξ  k   b     subscript   superscript  C  c     a  b      \left(\frac{\partial\xi^{(c)}_{i}}{\partial x^{k}}-\frac{\partial\xi^{(c)}_{k}%
 }{\partial x^{i}}\right)\xi^{i}_{(a)}\xi^{k}_{(b)}=C^{c}_{\ ab}     where    C    a   b   c     subscript   superscript  C  c     a  b     C^{c}_{\ ab}   , the "structure constants" of the group, form a constant  order-three tensor  antisymmetric in its lower two indices. For any three-dimensional Bianchi space,    C    a   b   c     subscript   superscript  C  c     a  b     C^{c}_{\ ab}   is given by the relationship       C    a   b   c   =      ε   a  b  d     n   c  d     -    δ  a  c    a  b     +    δ  b  c    a  a          subscript   superscript  C  c     a  b           subscript  ε    a  b  d     superscript  n    c  d        subscript   superscript  δ  c   a    subscript  a  b        subscript   superscript  δ  c   b    subscript  a  a       C^{c}_{\ ab}=\varepsilon_{abd}n^{cd}-\delta^{c}_{a}a_{b}+\delta^{c}_{b}a_{a}     where    ε   a  b  d      subscript  ε    a  b  d     \varepsilon_{abd}   is the Levi-Civita symbol ,    δ  a  c     subscript   superscript  δ  c   a    \delta^{c}_{a}   is the Kronecker delta , and the vector     a  a   =   (  a  ,  0  ,  0  )        subscript  a  a    a  0  0     a_{a}=(a,0,0)   and diagonal tensor    n   c  d      superscript  n    c  d     n^{cd}   are described by the following table, where    n   (  i  )      superscript  n  i    n^{(i)}   gives the i th eigenvalue of    n   c  d      superscript  n    c  d     n^{cd}   ; 1 the parameter a runs over all positive real numbers :      Bianchi type      a   a   a          n   (  1  )      superscript  n  1    n^{(1)}          n   (  2  )      superscript  n  2    n^{(2)}          n   (  3  )      superscript  n  3    n^{(3)}      notes       I   0   0   0   0   describes Euclidean space     II   0   1   0   0      III   1   0   1   -1   the subcase of type VI a with    a  =  1      a  1    a=1        IV   1   0   0   1      V   1   0   0   0   has a hyper- pseudosphere as a special case     VI 0   0   1   -1   0      VI a      a   a   a      0   1   -1   when    a  =  1      a  1    a=1   , equivalent to type III     VII 0   0   1   1   0   has Euclidean space as a special case     VII a      a   a   a      0   1   1   has a hyper-pseudosphere as a special case     VIII   0   1   1   -1      IX   0   1   1   1   has a hypersphere as a special case     Cosmological application  In cosmology , this classification is used for a homogeneous  spacetime of dimension 3+1. The Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metrics are isotropic, which are particular cases of types I, V,    VII  h     subscript  VII  h    \scriptstyle\text{VII}_{h}   and IX. The Bianchi type I models include the Kasner metric as a special case. The Bianchi IX cosmologies include the Taub metric . 2 However, the dynamics near the singularity is approximately governed by a series of successive Kasner (Bianchi I) periods. The complicated dynamics, which essentially amounts to billiard motion in a portion of hyperbolic space, exhibits chaotic behaviour, and is named Mixmaster ; its analysis is referred to as the BKL analysis after Belinskii, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz. 3  4 More recent work has established a relation of (super-)gravity theories near a spacelike singularity (BKL-limit) with Lorentzian Kac–Moody algebras , Weyl groups and hyperbolic Coxeter groups . 5 6 7 Other more recent work is concerned with the discrete nature of the Kasner map and a continuous generalisation. 8 9 10  Curvature of Bianchi spaces  The Bianchi spaces have the property that their Ricci tensors can be separated into a product of the basis vectors associated with the space and a coordinate-independent tensor.
