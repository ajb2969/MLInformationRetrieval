McGee graph

In the mathematical field of graph theory, the McGee Graph or the (3-7)-cage is a 3-regular graph with 24 vertices and 36 edges.1
The McGeeGraph is the unique (3,7)-cage (the smallest cubic graph of girth 7). It is also the smallest cubic cage that is not a Moore graph.
First discovered by Sachs but unpublished,2 the graph is named after McGee who published the result in 1960.3 Then, the McGee graph was the proven the unique (3,7)-cage by Tutte in 1966.456
The McGee graph requires at least eight crossings in any drawing of it in the plane. It is one of five non-isomorphic graphs tied for being the smallest cubic graph that requires eight crossings. Another of these five graphs is the generalized Petersen graph , also known as the Nauru graph.78
The McGeeGraph has radius 4, diameter 4, chromatic number 3 and chromatic index 3. It is also a 3-vertex-connected and a 3-edge-connected graph.
Algebraic properties
The characteristic polynomial of the McGeeGraph graph is 
 
 
 
 .
The automorphism group of the McGee graph is of order 32 and doesn't acts transitively upon its vertices: there are two vertex orbits of lengths 8 and 16. The McGee is the smallest cubic cage that is not a vertex-transitive graph.9
