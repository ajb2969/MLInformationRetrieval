   6-methylsalicylic-acid synthase      6-methylsalicylic-acid synthase   In enzymology , a 6-methylsalicylic-acid synthase () is an polyketide synthase that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + 3 malonyl-CoA + NADPH + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   6-methylsalicylate + 4 CoA + 3 CO 2 + NADP + + H 2 O   (Figure)  6-methylsalicylic-acid synthase reaction   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA , malonyl-CoA , NADPH , and H + , whereas its 5 products are 6-methylsalicylate , CoA , CO 2 , NADP + , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:malonyl-CoA C-acyltransferase (decarboxylating, oxoacyl-reducing, thioester-hydrolysing and cyclizing) . Other names in common use include MSAS , and 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase .  References       "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
