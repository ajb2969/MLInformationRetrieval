   Isohexenylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase      Isohexenylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase   In enzymology , an isohexenylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-hydroxy-3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)glutaryl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)pent-2-enedioyl-CoA + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 3-hydroxy-3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)glutaryl-CoA , and two products , 3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)pent-2-enedioyl-CoA and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-hydroxy-3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)glutaryl-CoA hydro-lyase [3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)pent-2-enedioyl-CoA-forming] . Other names in common use include 3-hydroxy-3-isohexenylglutaryl-CoA-hydrolase , isohexenylglutaconyl coenzyme A hydratase , beta-isohexenylglutaconyl-CoA-hydratase , and 3-hydroxy-3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)glutaryl-CoA hydro-lyase .
