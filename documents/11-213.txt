Isohexenylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase




Isohexenylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase

In enzymology, an isohexenylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-hydroxy-3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)glutaryl-CoA 
 
 
 
  3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)pent-2-enedioyl-CoA + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 3-hydroxy-3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)glutaryl-CoA, and two products, 3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)pent-2-enedioyl-CoA and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-hydroxy-3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)glutaryl-CoA hydro-lyase [3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)pent-2-enedioyl-CoA-forming]. Other names in common use include 3-hydroxy-3-isohexenylglutaryl-CoA-hydrolase, isohexenylglutaconyl coenzyme A hydratase, beta-isohexenylglutaconyl-CoA-hydratase, and 3-hydroxy-3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)glutaryl-CoA hydro-lyase.
