Hadamard three-circle theorem

In complex analysis, a branch of mathematics, the Hadamard three-circle theorem is a result about the behavior of holomorphic functions.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a holomorphic function on the annulus



Let 
 
 
 
  be the maximum of 
 
 
 
  on the circle

 
  Then, 
 
 
 
  is a convex function of the logarithm

 
  Moreover, if 
 
 
 
  is not of the form 
 
 
 
  for some constants

 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is strictly convex as a function of 
 
 

The conclusion of the theorem can be restated as



for any three concentric circles of radii $r_1 
 
 ==History==
 A statement and proof for the theorem was given by [[J.E. Littlewood]] in 1912, but he attributes it to no one in particular, stating it as a known theorem. [[Harald Bohr]] and [[Edmund Landau]] attribute the theorem to [[Jacques Hadamard]], writing in 1896; Hadamard  published no proof.{{harvnb|Edwards|1974|loc=Section 9.3}}
 ==Proof==
 The three circles theorem follows from the fact that for any real ''a'', the function Re log(''z''''a''''f''(''z'')) is harmonic between two circles, and therefore takes its maximum value on one of the circles. The theorem follows by choosing the constant ''a'' so that this harmonic function has the same maximum value on both circles.
  
 The theorem can also be deduced  directly from [[Hadamard three-lines theorem|Hadamard's three-lines theorem]].{{harvnb|Ullrich|2008}}
