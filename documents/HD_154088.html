<p>HD 154088 is a modestly bright star that lies at the bottom of Ophiuchus, near to the border with Scorpius and near to the plane of the Milky Way. The star was recognised as a high proper motion star during the last century, and early Earth-based parallax measurements such as that of the <a href="Gliese_Catalogue_of_Nearby_Stars" title="wikilink">Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars</a> indicated a distance of about 50 light-years.</p>

<p>The star has a spectral type of K0V, indicating that it is a main sequence star that is about 350 degrees cooler than the Sun. On the <a href="Hertzsprung-Russell_diagram" title="wikilink">Hertzsprung-Russell diagram</a> (left), the star lies slightly above the main sequence. This is because the star is very <a href="metallicity" title="wikilink">metal-rich</a>; with an Fe/H of 0.3 dex the star has about twice the solar abundance of iron, which makes HD 154088 fall into the somewhat vague group of super metal-rich (SMR) stars. The giant planet occurrence rate of Fe/H = 0.3 stars is on the order of 30%, but HD 154088 is not currently known to host any giant planets.</p>

<p>HD 154088 has a pronounced magnetic field.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It also has a magnetic cycle similar to the Sun,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> though its length is not well constrained.</p>

<p>A planet orbiting HD 154088 discovered with the <a href="High_Accuracy_Radial_Velocity_Planet_Searcher" title="wikilink">HARPS</a> spectrograph was announced in September 2011. With a minimum mass of 6 Earth masses, the companion falls into the regime of Super-Earths.</p>

<p>HD 154088 is also being observed under the <a href="W._M._Keck_Observatory" title="wikilink">Keck</a> Eta-Earth radial velocity survey.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> HD 154088 b is a close match for planet candidate 1 (orbital period = 18.1 days, minimum mass = 6.5 M<sub>âŠ•</sub>), so they may be the same detection.</p>
