   Effaceable functor      Effaceable functor   In mathematics, an effaceable functor is an additive functor  F between abelian categories  C and D for which, for each object A in C , there exists a monomorphism     u  :   A  →  M      normal-:  u   normal-→  A  M     u:A\to M   , for some M , such that     F   (  u  )    =  0        F  u   0    F(u)=0   . Similarly, a coeffaceable functor is one for which, for each A , there is an epimorphism into A that is killed by F . The notions were introduced in Grothendieck's Tohoku paper .  A theorem of Grothendieck says that every effaceble δ-functor (i.e., effaceable in each degree) is universal.
