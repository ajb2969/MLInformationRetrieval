   Weyl's inequality      Weyl's inequality   In mathematics, there are at least two results known as Weyl's inequality .  Weyl's inequality in number theory  In number theory , Weyl's inequality , named for Hermann Weyl , states that if M , N , a and q are integers, with a and q  coprime , q > 0, and f is a real  polynomial of degree k whose leading coefficient c satisfies        |   c  -   a  /  q    |   ≤   t   q   -  2      ,          c    a  q       t   superscript  q    2       |c-a/q|\leq tq^{-2},\,     for some t greater than or equal to 1, then for any positive real number   ε   ε   \scriptstyle\varepsilon   one has         ∑   x  =  M    M  +  N     exp   (   2  π  i  f   (  x  )    )     =   O   (    N   1  +  ε      (    t  q   +   1  N   +   t   N   k  -  1     +   q   N  k     )    2   1  -  k      )   as  N   →  ∞   .          superscript   subscript     x  M      M  N        2  π  i  f  x       O     superscript  N    1  ε     superscript      t  q     1  N     t   superscript  N    k  1       q   superscript  N  k      superscript  2    1  k      as  N     normal-→        \sum_{x=M}^{M+N}\exp(2\pi if(x))=O\left(N^{1+\varepsilon}\left({t\over q}+{1%

 \to\infty.     This inequality will only be useful when       q  <   N  k    ,      q   superscript  N  k     q     for otherwise estimating the modulus of the exponential sum by means of the triangle inequality as     ≤  N      absent  N    \scriptstyle\leq\,N   provides a better bound.  Weyl's inequality in matrix theory  In linear algebra, Weyl's inequality is a theorem about the changes to eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix that is perturbed. It is useful if we wish to know the eigenvalues of the Hermitian matrix H but there is an uncertainty about the entries of H . We let H be the exact matrix and P be a perturbation matrix that represents the uncertainty. The matrix we 'measure' is     M   =    H   +  P       M    H  P     \scriptstyle M\,=\,H\,+\,P   .  The theorem says that if M , H and P are all n by n Hermitian matrices, where M has eigenvalues       μ  1   ≥  ⋯  ≥    μ  n           subscript  μ  1   normal-⋯        subscript  μ  n      \mu_{1}\geq\cdots\geq\mu_{n}\,     and H has eigenvalues       ν  1   ≥  ⋯  ≥    ν  n           subscript  ν  1   normal-⋯        subscript  ν  n      \nu_{1}\geq\cdots\geq\nu_{n}\,     and P has eigenvalues       ρ  1   ≥  ⋯  ≥    ρ  n           subscript  ρ  1   normal-⋯        subscript  ρ  n      \rho_{1}\geq\cdots\geq\rho_{n}\,     then the following inequalities hold for     i   =   1  ,  …  ,  n       i   1  normal-…  n     \scriptstyle i\,=\,1,\dots,n   :        ν  i   +   ρ  n    ≤   μ  i   ≤    ν  i   +    ρ  1              subscript  ν  i    subscript  ρ  n     subscript  μ  i           subscript  ν  i    subscript  ρ  1       \nu_{i}+\rho_{n}\leq\mu_{i}\leq\nu_{i}+\rho_{1}\,     More generally, if       j  +  k   -   n    ≥   i   ≥    r  +  s   -  1    ,   …  ,  n      formulae-sequence          j  k   n   i           r  s   1      normal-…  n     \scriptstyle j+k-n\,\geq\,i\,\geq\,r+s-1,\dots,n   , we have        ν  j   +   ρ  k    ≤   μ  i   ≤    ν  r   +    ρ  s              subscript  ν  j    subscript  ρ  k     subscript  μ  i           subscript  ν  r    subscript  ρ  s       \nu_{j}+\rho_{k}\leq\mu_{i}\leq\nu_{r}+\rho_{s}\,     If P is positive definite (that is,      ρ  n    >  0       subscript  ρ  n   0    \scriptstyle\rho_{n}\,>\,0   ) then this implies         μ  i   >   ν  i      ∀  i   =   1  ,  …  ,  n     .     formulae-sequence     subscript  μ  i    subscript  ν  i       for-all  i    1  normal-…  n      \mu_{i}>\nu_{i}\quad\forall i=1,\dots,n.\,     Note that we can order the eigenvalues because the matrices are Hermitian and therefore the eigenvalues are real.  Applications  Estimating perturbations of the spectrum  Assume that we have a bound on P in the sense that we know that its spectral norm (or, indeed, any consistent matrix norm) satisfies      ∥  P  ∥   2   ≤  ϵ       subscript   norm  P   2   ϵ    \|P\|_{2}\leq\epsilon   . Then it follows that all its eigenvalues are bounded in absolute value by   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   . Applying Weyl's inequality, it follows that the spectra of M and H are close in the sense that         |    μ  i   -   ν  i    |   ≤  ϵ     ∀  i   =   1  ,  …  ,  n     .     formulae-sequence         subscript  μ  i    subscript  ν  i     ϵ      for-all  i    1  normal-…  n      |\mu_{i}-\nu_{i}|\leq\epsilon\qquad\forall i=1,\ldots,n.     Weyl's inequality for singular values  The singular values { σ k } of a square matrix M are the square roots of eigenvalues of M*M (equivalently MM* ). Since Hermitian matrices follow Weyl's inequality, if we take any matrix A then its singular values will be the square root of the eigenvalues of B=A*A which is a Hermitian matrix. Now since Weyl's inequality hold for B, therefore for the singular values of A . 1  This result gives the bound for the perturbation in singular values of a matrix A caused due to perturbation in A .
