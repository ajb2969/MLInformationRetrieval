   Uniform matroid      Uniform matroid   In mathematics, a uniform matroid is a matroid in which every permutation of the elements is a symmetry.  Definition  The uniform matroid    U    n  r      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  n   r     U{}^{r}_{n}   is defined over a set of   n   n   n   elements. A subset of the elements is independent if and only if it contains at most   r   r   r   elements. A subset is a basis if it has exactly   r   r   r   elements, and it is a circuit if it has exactly    r  +  1      r  1    r+1   elements. The rank of a subset   S   S   S   is    min   (   |  S  |   ,  r  )         S   r    \min(|S|,r)   and the rank of the matroid is   r   r   r   . 1 2  A matroid of rank   r   r   r   is uniform if and only if all of its circuits have exactly    r  +  1      r  1    r+1   elements. 3  The matroid    U    n  2      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  n   2     U{}^{2}_{n}   is called the    n   n   n   -point line .  Duality and minors  The dual matroid of the uniform matroid    U    n  r      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  n   r     U{}^{r}_{n}   is another uniform matroid    U    n   n  -  r       fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  n     n  r      U{}^{n-r}_{n}   . A uniform matroid is self-dual if and only if    r  =   n  /  2       r    n  2     r=n/2   . 4  Every minor of a uniform matroid is uniform. Restricting a uniform matroid    U    n  r      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  n   r     U{}^{r}_{n}   by one element (as long as    r  <  n      r  n    r   ) produces the matroid    U     n  -  1   r      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent    n  1    r     U{}^{r}_{n-1}   and contracting it by one element (as long as    r  >  0      r  0    r>0   ) produces the matroid    U     n  -  1    r  -  1       fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent    n  1      r  1      U{}^{r-1}_{n-1}   . 5  Realization  The uniform matroid    U    n  r      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  n   r     U{}^{r}_{n}   may be represented as the matroid of affinely independent subsets of   n   n   n   points in general position in   r   r   r   -dimensional Euclidean space , or as the matroid of linearly independent subsets of   n   n   n   vectors in general position in an    (   r  +  1   )      r  1    (r+1)   -dimensional real vector space .  Every uniform matroid may also be realized in projective spaces and vector spaces over all sufficiently large finite fields . 6 However, the field must be large enough to include enough independent vectors. For instance, the   n   n   n   -point line    U    n  2      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  n   2     U{}^{2}_{n}   can be realized only over finite fields of    n  -  1      n  1    n-1   or more elements (because otherwise the projective line over that field would have fewer than   n   n   n   points)    U    4  2      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  4   2     U{}^{2}_{4}   is not a binary matroid ,    U    5  2      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  5   2     U{}^{2}_{5}   is not a ternary matroid, etc. For this reason, uniform matroids play an important role in Rota's conjecture concerning the forbidden minor characterization of the matroids that can be realized over finite fields. 7  Algorithms  The problem of finding the minimum-weight basis of a weighted uniform matroid is well-studied in computer science as the selection problem . It may be solved in linear time . 8  Any algorithm that tests whether a given matroid is uniform, given access to the matroid via an independence oracle , must perform an exponential number of oracle queries, and therefore cannot take polynomial time. 9  Related matroids  Unless    r  ∈   {  0  ,  n  }       r   0  n     r\in\{0,n\}   , a uniform matroid    U    n  r      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  n   r     U{}^{r}_{n}   is connected: it is not the direct sum of two smaller matroids. 10 The direct sum of a family of uniform matroids (not necessarily all with the same parameters) is called a partition matroid .  Every uniform matroid is a paving matroid , 11 a transversal matroid 12 and a strict gammoid . 13  Not every uniform matroid is graphic , and the uniform matroids provide the smallest example of a non-graphic matroid,    U    4  2      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  4   2     U{}^{2}_{4}   . The uniform matroid    U    n  1      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  n   1     U{}^{1}_{n}   is the graphic matroid of an   n   n   n   -edge dipole graph , and the dual uniform matroid    U    n   n  -  1       fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  n     n  1      U{}^{n-1}_{n}   is the graphic matroid of its dual graph , the   n   n   n   -edge cycle graph .    U    n  0      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  n   0     U{}^{0}_{n}   is the graphic matroid of a graph with   n   n   n   self-loops, and    U    n  n      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  n   n     U{}^{n}_{n}   is the graphic matroid of an   n   n   n   -edge forest . Other than these examples, every uniform matroid    U    n  r      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  n   r     U{}^{r}_{n}   with    1  <  r  <   n  -  1         1  r         n  1      1   contains    U    4  2      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  4   2     U{}^{2}_{4}   as a minor and therefore is not graphic. 14  The   n   n   n   -point line provides an example of a Sylvester matroid , a matroid in which every line contains three or more points. 15  See also   K-set (geometry)   References  "  Category:Matroid theory     .
