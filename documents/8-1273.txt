   Hardy's inequality      Hardy's inequality   Hardy's inequality is an inequality in mathematics , named after G. H. Hardy . It states that if     a  1   ,   a  2   ,   a  3   ,  …      subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2    subscript  a  3   normal-…    a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\dots   is a sequence of non-negative  real numbers which is not identically zero, then for every real number p > 1 one has         ∑   n  =  1   ∞     (     a  1   +   a  2   +  ⋯  +   a  n    n   )   p    <     (   p   p  -  1    )   p     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n  p      .        superscript   subscript     n  1       superscript       subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-⋯   subscript  a  n    n   p       superscript    p    p  1    p     superscript   subscript     n  1       superscript   subscript  a  n   p       \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n}\right)^{p}<\left(%
 \frac{p}{p-1}\right)^{p}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}^{p}.     An integral version of Hardy's inequality states if f is an integrable function with non-negative values, then         ∫  0  ∞       (    1  x     ∫  0  x    f   (  t  )   d  t     )   p    d  x    ≤     (   p   p  -  1    )   p     ∫  0  ∞    f     (  x  )   p    d  x      .        superscript   subscript   0        superscript      1  x     superscript   subscript   0   x     f  t  d  t     p   d  x       superscript    p    p  1    p     superscript   subscript   0       f   superscript  x  p   d  x       \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{x}\int_{0}^{x}f(t)\,dt\right)^{p}\,dx\leq\left%
 (\frac{p}{p-1}\right)^{p}\int_{0}^{\infty}f(x)^{p}\,dx.     Equality holds if and only if  f ( x ) = 0 almost everywhere .  Hardy's inequality was first published and proved (at least the discrete version with a worse constant) in 1920 in a note by Hardy. 1 The original formulation was in an integral form slightly different from the above.
