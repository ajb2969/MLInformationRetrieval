   Artin–Schreier curve      Artin–Schreier curve   In mathematics, an Artin–Schreier curve is a plane curve defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic   p   p   p   by an equation        y  p   -  y   =   f   (  x  )           superscript  y  p   y     f  x     y^{p}-y=f(x)   for some rational function    f   f   f   over that field.  One of the most important examples of such curves is hyperelliptic curves in characteristic 2, whose Jacobian varieties have been suggested for use in cryptography . 1 It is common to write these curves in the form        y  2   +   h   (  x  )   y    =   f   (  x  )           superscript  y  2     h  x  y      f  x     y^{2}+h(x)y=f(x)   for some polynomials   f   f   f   and   h   h   h   .  Definition  More generally, an Artin-Schreier curve defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic   p   p   p   is a branched covering      C  →   ℙ  1      normal-→  C   superscript  ℙ  1     C\to\mathbb{P}^{1}   of the projective line of degree   p   p   p   . Such a cover is necessarily cyclic , that is, the Galois group of the corresponding algebraic function field extension is the cyclic group      ℤ  /  p   ℤ        ℤ  p   ℤ    \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}   . In other words,      k   (  C  )    /  k    (  x  )           k  C   k   x    k(C)/k(x)   is an Artin–Schreier extension .  The fundamental theorem of Artin–Schreier theory implies that such a curve defined over a field   k   k   k   has an affine model         y  p   -  y   =   f   (  x  )     ,         superscript  y  p   y     f  x     y^{p}-y=f(x),   for some rational function    f  ∈   k   (  x  )        f    k  x     f\in k(x)   that is not equal for     z  p   -  z       superscript  z  p   z    z^{p}-z   for any other rational function   z   z   z   . In other words, if we define polynomial     g   (  z  )    =    z  p   -  z         g  z      superscript  z  p   z     g(z)=z^{p}-z   , then we require that    f  ∈     k   (  x  )    \  g    (   k   (  x  )    )        f     normal-\    k  x   g     k  x      f\in k(x)\backslash g(k(x))   .  Ramification  Let    C  :     y  p   -  y   =   f   (  x  )        normal-:  C       superscript  y  p   y     f  x      C:y^{p}-y=f(x)   be an Artin–Schreier curve. Rational function   f   f   f   over an algebraically closed field   k   k   k   has partial fraction decomposition       f   (  x  )    =     f  ∞    (  x  )    +    ∑   α  ∈   B  ′       f  α    (   1   x  -  α    )            f  x        subscript  f    x     subscript     α   superscript  B  normal-′        subscript  f  α     1    x  α         f(x)=f_{\infty}(x)+\sum_{\alpha\in B^{\prime}}f_{\alpha}\left(\frac{1}{x-%
 \alpha}\right)   for some finite set    B  ′     superscript  B  normal-′    B^{\prime}   of elements of   k   k   k   and corresponding non-constant polynomials    f  α     subscript  f  α    f_{\alpha}   defined over   k   k   k   , and (possibly constant) polynomial    f  ∞     subscript  f     f_{\infty}   . After a change of coordinates,   f   f   f   can be chosen so that the above polynomials have degrees coprime to   p   p   p   , and the same either holds for    f  ∞     subscript  f     f_{\infty}   or it is zero. If that is the case, we define      B  =   {      B  ′        if   f  ∞    =  0   ,         B  ′   ∪   {  ∞  }      otherwise.          B   cases   superscript  B  normal-′       if   subscript  f     0      superscript  B  normal-′       otherwise.     B=\begin{cases}B^{\prime}&\text{ if }f_{\infty}=0,\\
 B^{\prime}\cup\{\infty\}&\text{ otherwise.}\end{cases}   Then the set    B  ⊂    ℙ  1    (  k  )        B     superscript  ℙ  1   k     B\subset\mathbb{P}^{1}(k)   is precisely the set of branch points of the covering    C  →   ℙ  1      normal-→  C   superscript  ℙ  1     C\to\mathbb{P}^{1}   .  For example, Artin–Schreier curve      y  p   -  y   =   f   (  x  )           superscript  y  p   y     f  x     y^{p}-y=f(x)   , where   f   f   f   is a polynomial, is ramified at a single point over the projective line.  Since degree of the cover is a prime number, over each branching point    α  ∈  B      α  B    \alpha\in B   lies a single ramification point    P  α     subscript  P  α    P_{\alpha}   with corresponding ramification index equal to       e   (   P  α   )    =     (   p  -  1   )    (    deg   (   f  α   )    +  1   )    +  1.         e   subscript  P  α          p  1      degree   subscript  f  α    1    1.     e(P_{\alpha})=(p-1)\big(\deg(f_{\alpha})+1\big)+1.     Genus  Since,   p   p   p   does not divide    deg   (   f  α   )      degree   subscript  f  α     \deg(f_{\alpha})   , ramification indices    e   (   P  α   )       e   subscript  P  α     e(P_{\alpha})   are not divisible by   p   p   p   either. Therefore, Riemann-Roch theorem may be used to compute that genus of an Artin–Schreier curve is given by       g  =     p  -  1   2    (     ∑   α  ∈  B     (    deg   (   f  α   )    +  1   )    -  2   )     .      g        p  1   2       subscript     α  B       degree   subscript  f  α    1    2      g=\frac{p-1}{2}\left(\sum_{\alpha\in B}\big(\deg(f_{\alpha})+1\big)-2\right).     For example, for a hyperelliptic curve defined over a field of characteristic    p  =  2      p  2    p=2   by equation      y  2   -  y   =   f   (  x  )           superscript  y  2   y     f  x     y^{2}-y=f(x)   with   f   f   f   decomposing as above, we have      g  =     ∑   α  ∈  B       deg   (   f  α   )    +  1   2    -  1.       g      subscript     α  B         degree   subscript  f  α    1   2    1.     g=\sum_{\alpha\in B}\frac{\deg(f_{\alpha})+1}{2}-1.     Generalizations  Artin–Schreier curves are a particular case of plane curves defined over an algebraically closed field   k   k   k   of characteristic   p   p   p   by an equation       g   (   y  p   )    =   f   (  x  )          g   superscript  y  p      f  x     g(y^{p})=f(x)   for some separable polynomial     g  ∈   k   [  x  ]        g    k   delimited-[]  x      g\in k[x]   and rational function    f  ∈     k   (  x  )    \  g    (   k   (  x  )    )        f     normal-\    k  x   g     k  x      f\in k(x)\backslash g(k(x))   . Mapping     (  x  ,  y  )   ↦  x     maps-to   x  y   x    (x,y)\mapsto x   yields a covering map from the curve   C   C   C   to the projective line    ℙ  1     superscript  ℙ  1    \mathbb{P}^{1}   . Separability of defining polynomial   g   g   g   ensures separability of the corresponding function field extension      k   (  C  )    /  k    (  x  )           k  C   k   x    k(C)/k(x)   . If     g   (   y  p   )    =     a  m    y   p  m     +    a   m  -  1     y   p   m  -  1      +  ⋯  +    a  1    y  p    +   a  0          g   superscript  y  p         subscript  a  m    superscript  y   superscript  p  m        subscript  a    m  1     superscript  y   superscript  p    m  1      normal-⋯     subscript  a  1    superscript  y  p     subscript  a  0      g(y^{p})=a_{m}y^{p^{m}}+a_{m-1}y^{p^{m-1}}+\cdots+a_{1}y^{p}+a_{0}   , a change of variables can be found so that     a  m   =   a  1   =  1         subscript  a  m    subscript  a  1        1     a_{m}=a_{1}=1   and     a  0   =  0       subscript  a  0   0    a_{0}=0   . It has been shown 2 that such curves can be built via a sequence of Artin-Schreier extension, that is, there exists a sequence of cyclic coverings of curves       C  →   C   m  -  1    →  ⋯  →   C  0   =   ℙ  1    ,       normal-→  C   subscript  C    m  1      normal-→    normal-⋯    normal-→     subscript  C  0         superscript  ℙ  1      C\to C_{m-1}\to\cdots\to C_{0}=\mathbb{P}^{1},   each of degree   p   p   p   , starting with the projective line.
