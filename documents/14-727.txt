Weighting pattern

A weighting pattern for a linear dynamical system describes the relationship between an input 
 
 
 
  and output 
 
 
 
 . Given the time-variant system described by





 
 , then the output can be written as


 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the weighting pattern for the system. For such a system, the weighting pattern is 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is the state transition matrix.
The weighting pattern will determine a system, but if there exists a realization for this weighting pattern then there exist many that do so.1
Linear time invariant system
In a LTI system then the weighting pattern is:

Continuous




where 
 
 
 
  is the matrix exponential.

Discrete
