   Hobby–Rice theorem      Hobby–Rice theorem   In mathematics , and in particular the necklace splitting problem , the Hobby–Rice theorem is a result that is useful in establishing the existence of certain solutions. It was proved in 1965 by Charles R. Hobby and John R. Rice ; 1 a simplified proof was given in 1976 by A. Pinkus. 2  The theorem  Given an integer k , define a partition of the interval [0,1] as a sequence of numbers which divide the interval to    k  +  1      k  1    k+1   subintervals:      0  =   z  0   <   z  1   <  ⋯  <   z  k   <   z   k  +  1    =  1        0   subscript  z  0         subscript  z  1        normal-⋯        subscript  z  k         subscript  z    k  1         1     0=z_{0}     Define a signed partition as a partition in which each subinterval   i   i   i   has an associated sign    δ  i     subscript  δ  i    \delta_{i}   :        δ  1   ,  …  ,   δ   k  +  1     ∈   {   +  1   ,   -  1   }         subscript  δ  1   normal-…   subscript  δ    k  1        1     1      \delta_{1},\ldots,\delta_{k+1}\in\left\{+1,-1\right\}     The Hobby-Rice theorem says that for every k continuously integrable functions:        g  1   ,  …  ,   g  k    :    [  0  ,  1  ]   ⟶  ℝ      normal-:    subscript  g  1   normal-…   subscript  g  k     normal-⟶   0  1   ℝ     g_{1},\ldots,g_{k}\colon[0,1]\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}     there exists a signed partition of [0,1] such that:         ∑   i  =  1    k  +  1       δ  i      ∫   z   i  -  1     z  i      g  j    (  z  )   d  z      =   0  for  1   ≤  j  ≤  k   .          superscript   subscript     i  1      k  1       subscript  δ  i     superscript   subscript    subscript  z    i  1      subscript  z  i       subscript  g  j   z  d  z        0  for  1        j       k     \sum_{i=1}^{k+1}\delta_{i}\!\int_{z_{i-1}}^{z_{i}}g_{j}(z)\,dz=0\text{ for }1%
 \leq j\leq k.     (in other words: for each of the k functions, its integral over the positive subintervals equals its integral over the negative subintervals).  Application to fair division  The theorem was used by Noga Alon in the context of necklace splitting 3 in 1987.  Suppose the interval [0,1] is a cake . There are k partners and each of the k functions is a value-density function of one partner. We want to divide the cake to two parts such that all partners agree that the parts have the same value. The Hobby-Rice theorem implies that this can be done with k cuts.
