Epicyclic frequency

In astrophysics, particularly the study of accretion disks, the epicyclic frequency is the frequency at which a radially displaced fluid parcel will oscillate. It can be referred to as a "Rayleigh discriminant". When considering an astrophysical disc with differential rotation 
 
 
 
 , the epicyclic frequency 
 
 
 
  is given by


 
 , where R is the radial co-ordinate.1
This quantity can be used to examine the 'boundaries' of an accretion disc - when 
 
 
 
  becomes negative then small perturbations to the (assumed circular) orbit of a fluid parcel will become unstable, and the disc will develop an 'edge' at that point. For example, around a Schwarzschild black hole, the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) occurs at 3x the event horizon - at

For a Keplerian disk,
