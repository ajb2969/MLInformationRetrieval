   Epicyclic frequency      Epicyclic frequency   In astrophysics , particularly the study of accretion disks , the epicyclic frequency is the frequency at which a radially displaced fluid parcel will oscillate. It can be referred to as a " Rayleigh discriminant". When considering an astrophysical disc with differential rotation   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   , the epicyclic frequency   κ   κ   \kappa   is given by       κ  2   ≡     2  Ω   R    d   d  R     (    R  2   Ω   )         superscript  κ  2         2  normal-Ω   R     d    d  R       superscript  R  2   normal-Ω      \kappa^{2}\equiv\frac{2\Omega}{R}\frac{d}{dR}(R^{2}\Omega)   , where R is the radial co-ordinate. 1  This quantity can be used to examine the 'boundaries' of an accretion disc - when    κ  2     superscript  κ  2    \kappa^{2}   becomes negative then small perturbations to the (assumed circular) orbit of a fluid parcel will become unstable, and the disc will develop an 'edge' at that point. For example, around a Schwarzschild black hole, the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) occurs at 3x the event horizon - at     6  G  M   /   c  2         6  G  M    superscript  c  2     6GM/c^{2}   .  For a Keplerian disk,    κ  =  Ω      κ  normal-Ω    \kappa=\Omega   .  References    "  Category:Fluid dynamics  Category:Astrophysics     p161, Astrophysical Flows, Pringle and King 2007 ↩
