<h1>Draft:Deflection Magnetometer</h1>
<hr/>
<p>A deflection magnetometer is an instrument used to determine the magnetic dipole moment (m) of a bar magnet and horizontal intensity (BH) of earth’s magnetic field using a deflection magnetometer.</p>
<h2 id="working-principle-tangent-law">Working Principle : Tangent Law</h2>
<p>Consider a bar magnet with magnetic moment m, suspended horizontally in a region where there are two perpendicular horizontal magnetic fields, and external field B and the horizontal component of the earth’s field B<sub>H</sub>. If no external magnetic field B is present, the bar magnet will align with B<sub>H</sub>. Due to the field B, the magnet experiences a torque τ<sub>D</sub> , called the deflecting torque, which tends to deflect it from its original orientation parallel to B<sub>H</sub>. If θ is the angle between the bar magnet and B<sub>H</sub>, the magnitude of the deflecting torque will be, <span class="LaTeX">$\tau_D=mB cos\theta$</span><br/>
The bar magnet experiences a torque τ<sub>R</sub> due to the field B<sub>H</sub> which tends to restore it to its original orientation parallel to B<sub>H</sub>. This torque is known as the restoring torque, and it has magnitude: <span class="LaTeX">$\tau_R=mB_H sin\theta$</span><br/>
The suspended magnet is in equilibrium when, <span class="LaTeX">$=> \tau_R=\tau_D$</span><br/>
<span class="LaTeX">$=> mB_H sin\theta=mB cos\theta$</span><br/>
Thus we get, <span class="LaTeX">$B=B_H tan\theta$</span></p>
<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>
<p>Deflection magnetometer consists of a small magnetic needle pivoted on a sharp support such that it is free to rotate in a horizontal plane. A light, thin, long aluminium pointer is fixed perpendicular to the magnetic needle. The pointer also rotates along with the needle. There is a circular scale divided into four quadrants and each quadrant is graduated from 0^o to 90^o. A plane mirror fixed below the scale ensures reading without parallax error, as the image of the pointer is made to coincide exactly with pointer itself. The needle, aluminium pointer and the scale are enclosed in a box with a glass top. There are two arms graduated in centimetre and their zeroes coincide at the centre of the magnetic needle.</p>

<h2 id="end-on-or-tan-a-position">End-on (or) Tan A position</h2>
<p>The magnetic field at a point along the axial line of a bar magnet is perpendicular to the horizontal component of Earth’s magnetic field. If a magnetometer and a bar magnet are placed in such way that this condition is satisfied, then this arrangement is called Tan A position. To achieve this, the arms of the deflection magnetometer are placed along East-West direction (i.e) perpendicular to the magnetic meridian. The bar magnet is placed along East -West direction (i.e) parallel to the arms. When a bar magnet of magnetic moment <strong>M</strong> and length <em>2l</em> is placed at a distance <em>d</em> from the centre of the magnetic needle, the needle gets deflected through an angle θ due to the action of two magnetic fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>the field B due to the bar magnet acting along its axis and</li>
<li>the horizontal component of Earth’s magnetic field B<sub>h</sub></li>
</ul>
<p>The magnetic field at a distance d acting along the axial line of the bar magnet: <span class="LaTeX">$=> B=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{2Md}{(d^2-l^2)^2}$</span><br/>
According to Tangent law, <span class="LaTeX">$B=B_h tan \theta$</span><br/>
<span class="LaTeX">$=> \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{2Md}{(d^2-l^2)^2}=B_h tan\theta$</span></p>
<h2 id="broad-side-on-or-tan-b-position">Broad side-on (or) Tan B position</h2>
<p>The magnetic field at a point along the equatorial line of a bar magnet is perpendicular to the horizontal component of Earth’s magnetic field. If the magnetometer and a bar magnet are placed in such way that this condition is satisfied, then this arrangement is called Tan B position. To achieve this, the arms of the deflection magnetometer are placed along the North - South direction (i.e) along the magnetic meridian. The magnet is placed along East - West direction (i.e) parallel to the aluminium pointer. When a bar magnet of magnetic moment <strong>M</strong> and length <em>2l</em> is placed at a distance <em>d</em> from the centre of the magnetic needle, the needle gets deflected through an angle <em>θ</em> due to the action of the following two magnetic fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>The field B due to the bar magnet along its equatorial line</li>
<li>The horizontal component of Earth’s magnetic field<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$=> B=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{2Md}{(d^2+l^2)^\frac{3}{2}}$</span> According to tangent law, <span class="LaTeX">$B=B_h tan \theta$</span><br/>
<span class="LaTeX">$=> \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{2Md}{(d^2+l^2)^\frac{3}{2}}=B_h tan \theta$</span> If the magnet is short, <em>l</em> is small compared to <em>d</em> and hence <span class="LaTeX">$l^2$</span> is neglected.<br/>
<span class="LaTeX">$=> \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{M}{d^3}=B_h tan \theta$</span></p>
<h2 id="comparison-of-magnetic-moments-of-bar-magnets">Comparison of magnetic moments of bar magnets</h2>
<p>One may also use a deflection magnetometer to determine/compare magnetic moments of two unknown bar magnets by using either <strong>Deflection method</strong> (or) <strong>Null-deflection method</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="vibration-magnetometer">Vibration Magnetometer</h2>
<p>The equation of motion of the bar magnet suspended horizontally in the earth’s magnetic field is:<br/>
<span class="LaTeX">$=> I \theta+mB_H sin \theta=0$</span> Thus its time period of oscillation for a small <span class="LaTeX">$\theta$</span>, is approximately,<br/>
<span class="LaTeX">$=> T= 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{mB_H}}$</span> ...(1)<br/>
where I = moment of inertia of the magnet about the axis of oscillation<br/>
m = magnetic moment of the magnet<br/>
B<sub>H</sub> = horizontal intensity of the earth's magnetic field.<br/>
For a rectangular bar magnet,<span class="LaTeX">$l=M \frac{L^2+b^2}{12}$</span> Where M = mass of the magnet<br/>
L = length of the magnet (longest horizontal dimension)<br/>
b = breadth of the magnet (shortest horizontal dimension)<br/>
 Squaring equation (1)<br/>
<span class="LaTeX">$=> T^2=4 \pi^2 \frac{l}{mB_H}$</span> which gives us,<br/>
<span class="LaTeX">$=> mB_H=4\pi^2 \frac{l}{T^2}$</span> Thus, by measuring vibration (oscillation) period T and calculating the moment of inertia I of the bar magnet, mBH is determined using the vibration magnetometer.</p>
