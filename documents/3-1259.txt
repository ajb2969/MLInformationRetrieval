   Flat module      Flat module   In homological algebra and algebraic geometry , a flat module over a ring  R is an R - module  M such that taking the tensor product over R with M preserves exact sequences . A module is faithfully flat if taking the tensor product with a sequence produces an exact sequence if and only if the original sequence is exact.  Vector spaces over a field are flat modules. Free modules , or more generally projective modules , are also flat, over any R . For finitely generated modules over a Noetherian ring , flatness and projectivity are equivalent. For finitely generated modules over local rings , flatness, projectivity and freeness are all equivalent. 1 The field of quotients of an integral domain , and, more generally, any localization of a commutative ring are flat modules. The product of the local rings of a commutative ring is a faithfully flat module.  Flatness was introduced by  in his paper G√©ometrie Alg√©brique et G√©om√©trie Analytique . See also flat morphism .  Definition  Commutative rings  Let M be an R -module. The following conditions are all equivalent, so M is flat if it satisfies any (thus all) of them:   The functor          F  M   :     M  o  d   (  R  )    ‚Üí   M  o  d   (  R  )     ,   N  ‚Ü¶   M   ‚äó  R   N        normal-:   subscript  F  M    formulae-sequence   normal-‚Üí    M  o  d  R     M  o  d  R     maps-to  N    subscript  tensor-product  R   M  N       F_{M}:Mod(R)\to Mod(R),\quad N\mapsto M\otimes_{R}N       is exact, where    M  o  d   (  R  )       M  o  d  R    Mod(R)   is the category of   R   R   R   -modules.

Taking tensor products (over arbitrary rings) is always a right exact functor . Therefore, the R -module M is flat if and only if for any injective  homomorphism  K ‚Üí L of R -modules, the induced homomorphism K    ‚äó   tensor-product   \otimes    M ‚Üí L    ‚äó   tensor-product   \otimes    M is also injective.  Examples   For any multiplicatively closed subset S of a commutative ring R , the localization ring      S   -  1    R       superscript  S    1    R    S^{-1}R   is flat as an R -module. For example,   ‚Ñö   ‚Ñö   \mathbb{Q}   is flat over   ‚Ñ§   ‚Ñ§   \mathbb{Z}   (though not projective).       ‚Ñ§  /  n   ‚Ñ§        ‚Ñ§  n   ‚Ñ§    \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}   is not flat over   ‚Ñ§   ‚Ñ§   \mathbb{Z}   , because, for example,    n  :    ‚Ñ§  ‚Üí  ‚Ñ§   ,   x  ‚Ü¶   n  x        normal-:  n   formulae-sequence   normal-‚Üí  ‚Ñ§  ‚Ñ§    maps-to  x    n  x       n:\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z},\,x\mapsto nx   is injective, but tensored with     ‚Ñ§  /  n   ‚Ñ§        ‚Ñ§  n   ‚Ñ§    \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}   it is not.  Similarly,    ‚Ñö  /  ‚Ñ§      ‚Ñö  ‚Ñ§    \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}   is not flat over   ‚Ñ§   ‚Ñ§   \mathbb{Z}   .  Let    R  =    k   [  t  ]    ,  k       R     k   delimited-[]  t    k     R=k[t],k   a field, and    S  =    R   [  x  ]    /   (    t  x   -  1   )        S      R   delimited-[]  x        t  x   1      S=R[x]/(tx-1)   . Since S is the same thing as the localization    R   [   t   -  1    ]       R   delimited-[]   superscript  t    1       R[t^{-1}]   , it is flat over R . On the other hand,     R   [  x  ]    /   (    t  x   -  t   )         R   delimited-[]  x        t  x   t     R[x]/(tx-t)   is not flat over R since t is a torsion element on it (so it is not torsion-free).  Let A be a noetherian ring and I an ideal. Then the completion     A  ‚Üí   A  ^      normal-‚Üí  A   normal-^  A     A\to\widehat{A}   with respect to I is flat. 3 It is faithfully flat if and only if I is contained in the Jacobson radical of A . 4 (cf. Zariski ring .)  The direct sum     ‚äï   i  ‚àà  I     M  i       subscript  direct-sum    i  I     subscript  M  i     \bigoplus_{i\in I}M_{i}   is flat if and only if each    M  i     subscript  M  i    M_{i}   is flat.  Every product of A -modules is flat if and only if A is a coherent ring . 5  (Kunz) A noetherian ring containing a field of characteristic p is regular if and only if the Frobenius morphism  R ‚Üí R is flat and R is reduced.   Case of commutative rings  When M is a finitely-generated R-module, being flat is the same as being locally free in the following sense: M is a flat R-module if and only if for every prime ideal (or even just for every maximal ideal ) P of R, the localization     M  P     subscript  M  P    M_{P}   is free as a module over the localization     R  P     subscript  R  P    R_{P}   .  Let R be a local ring with nilpotent maximal ideal (e.g., an artinian local ring ) and M a module over it. Then M flat implies M free. 6  The local criterion for flatness states: 7   Let R be a local noetherian ring, S a local noetherian R -algebra with      ùî™  R   S   ‚äÇ   ùî™  S          subscript  ùî™  R   S    subscript  ùî™  S     \mathfrak{m}_{R}S\subset\mathfrak{m}_{S}   , and M a finitely generated S -module. Then M is flat over R if and only if      Tor  1  R    (  M  ,   R  /   ùî™  R    )    =  0.        superscript   subscript  Tor  1   R   M    R   subscript  ùî™  R     0.    \operatorname{Tor}_{1}^{R}(M,R/\mathfrak{m}_{R})=0.      The significance of this is that S need not be finite over R and we only need to consider the maximal ideal of R instead of an arbitrary ideal of R .  The next criterion is also useful for testing flatness: 8   Let R , S be as in the local criterion for flatness. Assume S is Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay and R is regular . Then S is flat over R if and only if     dim  S   =    dim  R   +   dim    S  /   ùî™  R    S          dim  S      dim  R    dim      S   subscript  ùî™  R    S       \operatorname{dim}S=\operatorname{dim}R+\operatorname{dim}S/\mathfrak{m}_{R}S   .   If S is an R -algebra, i.e., we have a homomorphism    f  :   R  ‚Üí  S      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  R  S     f\colon R\to S   , then S has the structure of an R -module, and hence it makes sense to ask if S is flat over R . If this is the case, then S is faithfully flat over R if and only if every prime ideal of R is the inverse image under f of a prime ideal in S . In other words, if and only if the induced map     f  *   :    Spec   (  S  )    ‚Üí   Spec   (  R  )        normal-:   superscript  f     normal-‚Üí    Spec  S     Spec  R      f^{*}\colon\mathrm{Spec}(S)\to\mathrm{Spec}(R)   is surjective.  Flat modules over commutative rings are always torsion-free . Projective modules (and thus free modules ) are always flat. For certain common classes of rings, these statements can be reversed (for example, every torsion-free module over a Dedekind ring is automatically flat and flat modules over perfect rings are always projective), as is subsumed in the following diagram of module properties:  (Figure)  Module properties in commutative algebra   An integral domain is called a Pr√ºfer domain if every torsion-free module over it is flat.  Categorical colimits  In general, arbitrary direct sums and direct limits of flat modules are flat, a consequence of the fact that the tensor product commutes with direct sums and direct limits (in fact with all colimits ), and that both direct sums and direct limits are exact functors . Submodules and factor modules of flat modules need not be flat in general (e.g. Z/nZ is not a flat Z-module for n>1). However we have the following result: the homomorphic image of a flat module M is flat if and only if the kernel is a pure submodule of M .  Daniel Lazard proved in 1969 that a module M is flat if and only if it is a direct limit of finitely-generated  free modules . 9 As a consequence, one can deduce that every finitely-presented flat module is projective.  An abelian group is flat (viewed as a Z-module) if and only if it is torsion-free.  Homological algebra  Flatness may also be expressed using the Tor functors , the left derived functors of the tensor product. A left R -module M is flat if and only if Tor n R (‚Äì, M ) = 0 for all    n  ‚â•  1      n  1    n\geq 1   (i.e., if and only if Tor n R ( X , M ) = 0 for all    n  ‚â•  1      n  1    n\geq 1   and all right R -modules X ). Similarly, a right R -module M is flat if and only if Tor n R ( M , X ) = 0 for all    n  ‚â•  1      n  1    n\geq 1   and all left R -modules X . Using the Tor functor's long exact sequences , one can then easily prove facts about a short exact sequence   image:short exact sequence ABC.png     If A and C are flat, then so is B  If B and C are flat, then so is A   If A and B are flat, C need not be flat in general. However, it can be shown that   If A is pure in B and B is flat, then A and C are flat.   Flat resolutions  A flat resolution of a module M is a resolution of the form   ... ‚Üí F 2 ‚Üí F 1 ‚Üí F 0 ‚Üí M ‚Üí 0   where the F i are all flat modules. Any free or projective resolution is necessarily a flat resolution. Flat resolutions can be used to compute the Tor functor .  The length of a finite flat resolution is the first subscript n such that F n is nonzero and F i =0 for i greater than n . If a module M admits a finite flat resolution, the minimal length among all finite flat resolutions of M is called its flat dimension and denoted fd( M ). If M does not admit a finite flat resolution, then by convention the flat dimension is said to be infinite. As an example, consider a module M such that fd( M )¬†=¬†0. In this situation, the exactness of the sequence 0 ‚Üí F 0 ‚Üí M ‚Üí 0 indicates that the arrow in the center is an isomorphism, and hence M itself is flat. 10  In some areas of module theory, a flat resolution must satisfy the additional requirement that each map is a flat pre-cover of the kernel of the map to the right. For projective resolutions, this condition is almost invisible: a projective pre-cover is simply an epimorphism from a projective module. These ideas are inspired from Auslander's work in approximations. These ideas are also familiar from the more common notion of minimal projective resolutions, where each map is required to be a projective cover of the kernel of the map to the right. However, projective covers need not exist in general, so minimal projective resolutions are only of limited use over rings like the integers.  While projective covers for modules do not always exist, it was speculated that for general rings, every module would have a flat cover, that is, every module would be the epimorphic image of a flat module under a homomorphism with superfluous kernel. This flat cover conjecture was explicitly first stated in . The conjecture turned out to be true, resolved positively and proved simultaneously by L. Bican, R. El Bashir and E. Enochs. This was preceded by important contributions by P. Eklof, J. Trlifaj and J. Xu.  Since flat covers exist for all modules over all rings, minimal flat resolutions can take the place of minimal projective resolutions in many circumstances. The measurement of the departure of flat resolutions from projective resolutions is called relative homological algebra , and is covered in classics such as  and in more recent works focussing on flat resolutions such as .  In constructive mathematics  Flat modules have increased importance in constructive mathematics , where projective modules are less useful. For example, that all free modules are projective is equivalent to the full axiom of choice , so theorems about projective modules, even if proved constructively, do not necessarily apply to free modules. In contrast, no choice is needed to prove that free modules are flat, so theorems about flat modules can still apply.  See also   generic flatness   References    N.
