   Jiles-Atherton model      Jiles-Atherton model   The Jiles-Atherton model of magnetic hysteresis was introduced in 1984. 1 This is one of the most popular models of magnetic hysteresis. Its main advantage is the fact that this model enables connection with physical parameters of the magnetic material . 2 Jiles-Atherton model enables calculation of minor and major hysteresis loops. 3 The original Jiles-Atherton model is suitable only for isotropic materials. 4 However, an extension of this model presented by Ramesh et al. 5 and corrected by Szewczyk 6 enables the modeling of anisotropic magnetic materials.  Principles  Magnetization    M   M   M   of the magnetic material sample in Jiles-Atherton model is calculated in the following steps 7 for each value of the magnetizing field   H   H   H   :   effective magnetic field    H  e     subscript  H  e    H_{\text{e}}   is calculated considering interdomain coupling   α   α   \alpha   and magnetization   M   M   M   ,  anhysteretic magnetization    M  an     subscript  M  an    M_{\text{an}}   is calculated for effective magnetic field    H  e     subscript  H  e    H_{\text{e}}   ,  magnetization   M   M   M   of the sample is calculated by solving ordinary differential equation taking into account sign of derivative of magnetizing field   H   H   H   (which is the source of hysteresis).   Parameters  Original Jiles-Atherton model considers following parameters: 8      Parameter   Units   Description          α   α   \alpha       Quantifies interdomain coupling in the magnetic material        a   a   a      A/m   Quantifies domain walls density in the magnetic material         M  s     subscript  M  s    M_{\text{s}}      A/m   Saturation magnetization of material        k   k   k      A/m   Quantifies average energy required to break pining site in the magnetic material        c   c   c       Magnetization reversibility     Extension considering uniaxial anisotropy introduced by Ramesh et al. 9 and corrected by Szewczyk 10 requires additional parameters:      Parameter   Units   Description           K  an     subscript  K  an    K_{\text{an}}          J  /   m  3       J   superscript  m  3     J/m^{3}      Average anisotropy energy density        ψ   ψ   \psi      rad   Angle between direction of magnetizing field   H   H   H   and direction of anisotropy easy axis        t   t   t       Participation of anisotropic phase in the magnetic material     Modelling the magnetic hysteresis loops  Effective magnetic field  Effective magnetic field    H  e     subscript  H  e    H_{\text{e}}   influencing on magnetic moments within the material may be calculated from following equation: 11       H  e   =   H  +   α  M         subscript  H  e     H    α  M      H_{\text{e}}=H+\alpha M    This effective magnetic field is analogous to the Weiss mean field acting on magnetic moments within a magnetic domain . 12  Anhysteretic magnetization  Anhysteretic magnetization can be observed experimentally, when magnetic material is demagnetized under the influence of constant magnetic field. However, measurements of anhysteretic magnetization are very sophisticated due to the fact, that the fluxmeter has to keep accuracy of integration during the demagnetization process. As a result, experimental verification of the model of anhysteretic magnetization is possible only for materials with negligible hysteresis loop. 13 Anhysteretic magnetization of typical magnetic material can be calculated as a weighted sum of isotropic and anisotropic anhysteretic magnetization: 14       M  an   =     (   1  -  t   )    M  an  iso    +   t   M  an  aniso          subscript  M  an         1  t    superscript   subscript  M  an   iso      t   superscript   subscript  M  an   aniso       M_{\text{an}}=(1-t)M_{\text{an}}^{\text{iso}}+tM_{\text{an}}^{\text{aniso}}     Isotropic  Isotropic anhysteretic magnetization    M  an  iso     superscript   subscript  M  an   iso    M_{\text{an}}^{\text{iso}}   is determined on the base of Boltzmann distribution . In the case of isotropic magnetic materials, Boltzmann distribution can be reduced to Langevin function connecting isotropic anhysteretic magnetization with effective maqnetic field    H  e     subscript  H  e    H_{\text{e}}   : 15       M  an  iso   =    M  s    (    coth   (    H  e   /  a   )    -   (   a  /   H  e    )    )         superscript   subscript  M  an   iso      subscript  M  s      hyperbolic-cotangent     subscript  H  e   a      a   subscript  H  e        M_{\text{an}}^{\text{iso}}=M_{\text{s}}(\coth(H_{\text{e}}/a)-(a/H_{\text{e}}))     Anisotropic  Anisotropic anhysteretic magnetization    M  an  aniso     superscript   subscript  M  an   aniso    M_{\text{an}}^{\text{aniso}}   is also determined on the base of Boltzmann distribution . 16 However, in such a case, there is no antiderivative for Boltzmann distribution function. 17 For this reason, integration has to be made numerically. In the original publication, anisotropic anhysteretic magnetization    M  an  aniso     superscript   subscript  M  an   aniso    M_{\text{an}}^{\text{aniso}}   is given as: 18       M  an  aniso   =    M  s       ∫  0  π      e    E   (  1  )    +   E   (  2  )       sin   (  θ  )     cos   (  θ  )    d  θ       ∫  0  π      e    E   (  1  )    +   E   (  2  )       sin   (  θ  )    d  θ           superscript   subscript  M  an   aniso      subscript  M  s       superscript   subscript   0   π      superscript  e      E  1     E  2       θ     θ   d  θ      superscript   subscript   0   π      superscript  e      E  1     E  2       θ   d  θ        M_{\text{an}}^{\text{aniso}}=M_{\text{s}}\frac{\int_{0}^{\pi}\!e^{E(1)+E(2)}%

Physical analysis leads to conclusion, that equation for anisotropic anhysteretic magnetization    M  an  aniso     superscript   subscript  M  an   aniso    M_{\text{an}}^{\text{aniso}}   has to be corrected to the following form: 20       M  an  aniso   =    M  s       ∫  0  π      e   0.5   (    E   (  1  )    +   E   (  2  )     )      sin   (  θ  )     cos   (  θ  )    d  θ       ∫  0  π      e   0.5   (    E   (  1  )    +   E   (  2  )     )      sin   (  θ  )    d  θ           superscript   subscript  M  an   aniso      subscript  M  s       superscript   subscript   0   π      superscript  e    0.5      E  1     E  2        θ     θ   d  θ      superscript   subscript   0   π      superscript  e    0.5      E  1     E  2        θ   d  θ        M_{\text{an}}^{\text{aniso}}=M_{\text{s}}\frac{\int_{0}^{\pi}\!e^{0.5(E(1)+E(2%

 }-M)}+\frac{c}{1+c}\frac{dM_{\text{an}}}{dH}    where   δ   δ   \delta   depends on direction of changes of magnetizing field   H   H   H   (    δ  =  1      δ  1    \delta=1   for increasing field,    δ  =   -  1       δ    1     \delta=-1   for decreasing field)  Flux density as a function of magnetizing field  Flux density    B   B   B   in the material is given as: 23      B   (  H  )    =    μ  0   M   (  H  )          B  H      subscript  μ  0   M  H     B(H)=\mu_{0}M(H)    where    μ  0     subscript  μ  0    \mu_{0}   is magnetic constant .  Numerical problems  Two most important computational problems connected with the Jiles-Atherton model were identified: 24   numerical integration of the anisotropic anhysteretic magnetization    M  an  aniso     superscript   subscript  M  an   aniso    M_{\text{an}}^{\text{aniso}}     solving the ordinary differential equation for    M   (  H  )       M  H    M(H)   dependence.   For numerical integration of the anisotropic anhysteretic magnetization    M  an  aniso     superscript   subscript  M  an   aniso    M_{\text{an}}^{\text{aniso}}   the Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formula has to be used. In GNU Octave this quadrature is implemented as quadgk() function. For solving ordinary differential equation for    M   (  H  )       M  H    M(H)   dependence, the Runge–Kutta methods are recommended. It was observed, that the best performing was 4-th order fixed step method. 25  Further development  Since its introduction in 1984, Jiles-Atherton model was intensively developed. As a result, this model may be applied for the modeling of:   frequency dependence of magnetic hysteresis loop in conductive materials 26 27  influence of stresses on magnetic hysteresis loops 28 29 30  magnetostriction of soft magnetic materials 31 32   Moreover, different corrections were implemented, especially:   to avoid unphysical states when reversible permeability is negative 33  to consider changes of average energy required to break pinning site 34   Applications  Jiles-Atherton model may be applied for modeling:   rotating electric machines 35  power transformers 36  magnetostrictive actuators 37  magnetoelastic sensors 38 39  magnetic field sensors (e. g. fluxgates) 40 41   It is also widely used for electronic circuit simulation , especially for models of inductive components, such as transformers or chokes . 42  References  External links   Jiles-Atherton model for Octave/MATLAB - open-source software for implementation of Jiles-Atherton model in GNU Octave and Matlab   "  Category:Magnetism     ↩  ↩    ↩  ↩         ↩         ↩   ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
