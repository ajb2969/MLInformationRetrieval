Jiles-Atherton model

The Jiles-Atherton model of magnetic hysteresis was introduced in 1984.1 This is one of the most popular models of magnetic hysteresis. Its main advantage is the fact that this model enables connection with physical parameters of the magnetic material.2 Jiles-Atherton model enables calculation of minor and major hysteresis loops.3 The original Jiles-Atherton model is suitable only for isotropic materials.4 However, an extension of this model presented by Ramesh et al.5 and corrected by Szewczyk 6 enables the modeling of anisotropic magnetic materials.
Principles
Magnetization

 
  of the magnetic material sample in Jiles-Atherton model is calculated in the following steps 7 for each value of the magnetizing field 
 
 
 
 :

effective magnetic field 
 
 
 
  is calculated considering interdomain coupling 
 
 
 
 
  and magnetization 
 
 
 
 ,
anhysteretic magnetization 
 
 
 
  is calculated for effective magnetic field 
 
 
 
 ,
magnetization 
 
 
 
  of the sample is calculated by solving ordinary differential equation taking into account sign of derivative of magnetizing field 
 
 
 
 
  (which is the source of hysteresis).

Participation of anisotropic phase in the magnetic material



Modelling the magnetic hysteresis loops
Effective magnetic field
Effective magnetic field 
 
 
 
  influencing on magnetic moments within the material may be calculated from following equation:11



 This effective magnetic field is analogous to the Weiss mean field acting on magnetic moments within a magnetic domain.12
Anhysteretic magnetization
Anhysteretic magnetization can be observed experimentally, when magnetic material is demagnetized under the influence of constant magnetic field. However, measurements of anhysteretic magnetization are very sophisticated due to the fact, that the fluxmeter has to keep accuracy of integration during the demagnetization process. As a result, experimental verification of the model of anhysteretic magnetization is possible only for materials with negligible hysteresis loop.13
 Anhysteretic magnetization of typical magnetic material can be calculated as a weighted sum of isotropic and anisotropic anhysteretic magnetization:14



Isotropic
Isotropic anhysteretic magnetization 
 
 
 
  is determined on the base of Boltzmann distribution. In the case of isotropic magnetic materials, Boltzmann distribution can be reduced to Langevin function connecting isotropic anhysteretic magnetization with effective maqnetic field 
 
 
 
 
 :15



Anisotropic
Anisotropic anhysteretic magnetization 
 
 
 
  is also determined on the base of Boltzmann distribution.16 However, in such a case, there is no antiderivative for Boltzmann distribution function.17 For this reason, integration has to be made numerically. In the original publication, anisotropic anhysteretic magnetization 
 
 
 
  is given as:18



 where






It should be highlighted, that typing mistake happened in the original Ramesh et al. publication.19 As a result, for isotropic material (where 
 
 
 
 ), presented form of anisotropic anhysteretic magnetization 
 
 
 
  is not coherent with isotropic anhysteretic magnetization 
 
 
 
  given by Langevin equation. Physical analysis leads to conclusion, that equation for anisotropic anhysteretic magnetization 
 
 
 
 
  has to be corrected to the following form:20



 In the corrected form, model for anisotropic anhysteretic magnetization 
 
 
 
  was confirmed experimentally for anisotropic amorphous alloys.21
Magnetization as a function of magnetizing field
In Jiles-Atherton model, M(H) dependence is given in form of following ordinary differential equation:22



 where 
 
 
 
  depends on direction of changes of magnetizing field 
 
 
 
 
  (
 
 
 
  for increasing field, 
 
 
 
  for decreasing field)
Flux density as a function of magnetizing field
Flux density

 
  in the material is given as:23


 where 
 
 
 
 
  is magnetic constant.
Numerical problems
Two most important computational problems connected with the Jiles-Atherton model were identified:24

numerical integration of the anisotropic anhysteretic magnetization 
 
 

solving the ordinary differential equation for 
 
 
 
  dependence.

For numerical integration of the anisotropic anhysteretic magnetization 
 
 
 
  the Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formula has to be used. In GNU Octave this quadrature is implemented as quadgk() function. For solving ordinary differential equation for 
 
 
 
  dependence, the Runge–Kutta methods are recommended. It was observed, that the best performing was 4-th order fixed step method.25
Further development
Since its introduction in 1984, Jiles-Atherton model was intensively developed. As a result, this model may be applied for the modeling of:

frequency dependence of magnetic hysteresis loop in conductive materials 2627
influence of stresses on magnetic hysteresis loops 282930
magnetostriction of soft magnetic materials 3132

Moreover, different corrections were implemented, especially:

to avoid unphysical states when reversible permeability is negative 33
to consider changes of average energy required to break pinning site 34

Applications
Jiles-Atherton model may be applied for modeling:

rotating electric machines 35
power transformers 36
magnetostrictive actuators 37
magnetoelastic sensors 3839
magnetic field sensors (e. g. fluxgates) 4041

It is also widely used for electronic circuit simulation, especially for models of inductive components, such as transformers or chokes.42
