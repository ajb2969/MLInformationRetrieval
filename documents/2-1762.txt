   Symplectic geometry      Symplectic geometry     Symplectic geometry is a branch of differential geometry and differential topology that studies symplectic manifolds ; that is, differentiable manifolds equipped with a closed , nondegenerate  2-form . Symplectic geometry has its origins in the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics where the phase space of certain classical systems takes on the structure of a symplectic manifold.  Introduction  A symplectic geometry is defined on a smooth even-dimensional space that is a differentiable manifold . On this space is defined a geometric object, the symplectic form , that allows for the measurement of sizes of two-dimensional objects in the space. The symplectic form in symplectic geometry plays a role analogous to that of the metric tensor in Riemannian geometry . Where the metric tensor measures lengths and angles, the symplectic form measures areas. 1  Symplectic geometry arose from the study of classical mechanics and an example of a symplectic structure is the motion of an object in one dimension. To specify the trajectory of the object, one requires both the position q and the momentum p , which form a point ( p , q ) in the Euclidean plane ℝ 2 . In this case, the symplectic form is      ω  =    d  p   ∧   d  q        ω      d  p     d  q      \omega=dp\wedge dq   and is an area form that measures the area A of a region S in the plane through integration:       A  =    ∫  S   ω    .      A    subscript   S   ω     A=\int_{S}\omega.   The area is important because as conservative dynamical systems evolve in time, this area is invariant. 2  Higher dimensional symplectic geometries are defined analogously. A 2 n -dimensional symplectic geometry is formed of pairs of directions      (   (   x  1   ,   x  2   )   ,   (   x  3   ,   x  4   )   ,   …   (   x    2  n   -  1    ,   x   2  n    )    )       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2      subscript  x  3    subscript  x  4      normal-…    subscript  x      2  n   1     subscript  x    2  n        ((x_{1},x_{2}),(x_{3},x_{4}),\ldots(x_{2n-1},x_{2n}))   in a 2 n -dimensional manifold along with a symplectic form       ω  =        d   x  1    ∧   d   x  2     +   d   x  3     ∧   d   x  4     +  ⋯  +   d   x    2  n   -  1      ∧   d   x   2  n       .      ω              d   subscript  x  1      d   subscript  x  2       d   subscript  x  3       d   subscript  x  4     normal-⋯    d   subscript  x      2  n   1        d   subscript  x    2  n        \omega=dx_{1}\wedge dx_{2}+dx_{3}\wedge dx_{4}+\cdots+dx_{2n-1}\wedge dx_{2n}.   This symplectic form yields the size of a 2 n -dimensional region V in the space as the sum of the areas of the projections of V onto each of the planes formed by the pairs of directions 3       A  =    ∫  V   ω   =         ∫  V    d   x  1     ∧   d   x  2     +    ∫  V    d   x  3      ∧   d   x  4     +  ⋯  +    ∫  V    d   x    2  n   -  1       ∧   d   x   2  n       .        A    subscript   V   ω                    subscript   V     d   subscript  x  1       d   subscript  x  2       subscript   V     d   subscript  x  3        d   subscript  x  4     normal-⋯    subscript   V     d   subscript  x      2  n   1         d   subscript  x    2  n         A=\int_{V}\omega=\int_{V}dx_{1}\wedge dx_{2}+\int_{V}dx_{3}\wedge dx_{4}+%
 \cdots+\int_{V}dx_{2n-1}\wedge dx_{2n}.     Comparison with Riemannian geometry  Symplectic geometry has a number of similarities with and differences from Riemannian geometry , which is the study of differentiable manifolds equipped with nondegenerate, symmetric 2-tensors (called metric tensors ). Unlike in the Riemannian case, symplectic manifolds have no local invariants such as curvature . This is a consequence of Darboux's theorem which states that a neighborhood of any point of a 2 n -dimensional symplectic manifold is isomorphic to the standard symplectic structure on an open set of ℝ 2 n . Another difference with Riemannian geometry is that not every differentiable manifold need admit a symplectic form; there are certain topological restrictions. For example, every symplectic manifold is even-dimensional and orientable . Additionally, if M is a closed symplectic manifold, then the 2nd de Rham cohomology  group  H 2 ( M ) is nontrivial; this implies, for example, that the only n -sphere that admits a symplectic form is the 2-sphere .  Examples and structures  Every Kähler manifold is also a symplectic manifold. Well into the 1970s, symplectic experts were unsure whether any compact non-Kähler symplectic manifolds existed, but since then many examples have been constructed (the first was due to William Thurston ); in particular, Robert Gompf has shown that every finitely presented group occurs as the fundamental group of some symplectic 4-manifold, in marked contrast with the Kähler case.  Most symplectic manifolds, one can say, are not Kähler; and so do not have an integrable complex structure compatible with the symplectic form. Mikhail Gromov , however, made the important observation that symplectic manifolds do admit an abundance of compatible almost complex structures , so that they satisfy all the axioms for a Kähler manifold except the requirement that the transition maps be holomorphic .  Gromov used the existence of almost complex structures on symplectic manifolds to develop a theory of pseudoholomorphic curves , which has led to a number of advancements in symplectic topology, including a class of symplectic invariants now known as Gromov–Witten invariants . These invariants also play a key role in string theory .  Name  Symplectic geometry is also called symplectic topology although the latter is really a subfield concerned with important global questions in symplectic geometry.  The term "symplectic" is a calque of "complex", introduced by ; previously, the "symplectic group" had been called the "line complex group". Complex comes from the Latin com-plexus , meaning "braided together" (co- + plexus), while symplectic comes from the corresponding Greek sym-plektikos (συμπλεκτικός); in both cases the suffix comes from the Indo-European root *plek-. 4 This naming reflects the deep connections between complex and symplectic structures. {{-}}  See also   Contact geometry  Hamiltonian mechanics  Geometric Mechanics  Moment map  Poisson geometry  Symplectic flow  Symplectic frame bundle  Symplectic integration  Symplectic manifold   Notes  References   Dusa McDuff and D.
