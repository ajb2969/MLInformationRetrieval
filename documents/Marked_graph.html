<h1>Marked graph</h1>
<hr/>

<p>A <strong>marked graph</strong> is a <a href="Petri_net" title="wikilink">Petri net</a> in which every place has exactly one incoming arc, and exactly one outgoing arc. This means, that there can <em>not</em> be <em>conflict</em>, but there can be <em>concurrency</em>. Mathematically

. Marked graphs are used mostly to mathematically represent concurrently running operations, such as a multiprocessor machine's internal process state. This class of Petri nets gets the name from a popular way of representing them: as a graph where each place is an edge and each transition is a node.</p>
<h2 id="uses">Uses</h2>

<p>Marked graphs are mainly used to mathematically represent concurrent mechanisms, in order to be able to mathematically derive certain characteristics of the design.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p> This example presents a Marked Graph, where a process is <a href="Fork_(operating_system)" title="wikilink">forked</a> at transition T1 and <a href="Synchronization_point#Data_synchronization" title="wikilink">synchronised</a> at T4. In between, two operations take place in non-deterministic fashion, T2 and T3. In fact, Petri nets are so much non-deterministic, that they may not take place at all. But the reason for having this non-deterministic property is not this, but to mimic real-life experiences which shows that parallel computing always means that it is impossible to determine which process/thread will finish first i.e. which operation(s) will execute faster. This can be due to waiting for <a href="Input/Output" title="wikilink">I/O</a> in real world, or just the different parameters given to the processes/threads.</p>
