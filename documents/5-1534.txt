   Specific rotation      Specific rotation   In chemistry , specific rotation ( [α] ) is a property of a chiral  chemical compound . 1 It is defined as the change in orientation of monochromatic  plane-polarized light , per unit distance–concentration product, as the light passes through a sample of a compound in solution. 2 Compounds which rotate light clockwise are said to be dextrorotary , and correspond with positive specific rotation values, while compounds which rotate light counterclockwise are said to be levorotary , and correspond with negative values. 3 If a compound is able to rotate plane-polarized light, it is said to be “ optically active ”.  Specific rotation is an intensive property , distinguishing it from the more general phenomenon of optical rotation . As such, the observed rotation ( α ) of a sample of a compound can be used to quantify the enantiomeric excess of that compound, provided that the specific rotation ( [α] ) for the enantiopure compound is known. The variance of specific rotation with wavelength—a phenomenon known as optical rotatory dispersion —can be used to find the absolute configuration of a molecule. 4 The concentration of bulk sugar solutions is sometimes determined by comparison of the observed optical rotation with the known specific rotation.  Definition  The CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics defines specific rotation as:   For an optically active substance, defined by [α] θ λ = α/γl, where α is the angle through which plane polarized light is rotated by a solution of mass concentration γ and path length l. Here θ is the Celsius temperature and λ the wavelength of the light at which the measurement is carried out. 5   Although the formal unit for specific rotation values is deg·mL·g −1 ·dm −1 , values for specific rotation are typically reported in units of degrees . 6 These values should always be accompanied by information about the temperature, solvent, concentration, and wavelength of light used, as all of these variables can affect the observed rotation. As noted above, temperature and wavelength are frequently reported as a superscript and subscript, respectively, while the solvent and concentration are reported parenthetically, or omitted entirely. Unless stated otherwise, path length is assumed to be one decimeter , 7 and concentration is assumed to be one gram per milliliter .

There is a linear relationship between the observed rotation and the concentration of optically active compound in the sample. There is a nonlinear relationship between the observed rotation and the wavelength of light used. Specific rotation is calculated using either of two equations, depending on whether the sample is a pure chemical to be tested or that chemical dissolved in solution.  For pure liquids  This equation is used:        [  α  ]   λ  T   =   α   l  ×  ρ         superscript   subscript   delimited-[]  α   λ   T     α    l  ρ      [\alpha]_{\lambda}^{T}=\frac{\alpha}{l\times\rho}     In this equation, α (Greek letter "alpha") is the measured rotation in degrees, l is the path length in decimeters, and ρ (Greek letter "rho") is the density of the liquid in g/mL, for a sample at a temperature T (given in degrees Celsius) and wavelength λ (in nanometers). If the wavelength of the light used is 589 nanometers ( the sodium D line ), the symbol “D” is used. The sign of the rotation (+ or −) is always given.        [  α  ]   D  20   +  6.2       superscript   subscript   delimited-[]  α   D   20   6.2    [\alpha]_{D}^{20}+6.2   °  For solutions  For solutions, a slightly different equation is used:        [  α  ]   λ  T   =   α   l  ×  c         superscript   subscript   delimited-[]  α   λ   T     α    l  c      [\alpha]_{\lambda}^{T}=\frac{\alpha}{l\times c}     In this equation, α (Greek letter "alpha") is the measured rotation in degrees, l is the path length in decimeters, c is the concentration in g/mL, T is the temperature at which the measurement was taken (in degrees Celsius), and λ is the wavelength in nanometers. 8  For practical and historical reasons, concentrations are often reported in units of g/100mL. In this case, a correction factor in the numerator is necessary: 9 10        [  α  ]   λ  T   =    100  ×  α    l  ×  c         superscript   subscript   delimited-[]  α   λ   T       100  α     l  c      [\alpha]_{\lambda}^{T}=\frac{100\times\alpha}{l\times c}     When using this equation, the concentration and the solvent may be provided in parentheses after the rotation. The rotation is reported using degrees, and no units of concentration are given (it is assumed to be g/100mL). The sign of the rotation (+ or −) is always given. If the wavelength of the light used is 589 nanometer (the sodium D line ), the symbol “D” is used. If the temperature is omitted, it is assumed to be at standard room temperature (20 °C).  For example, the specific rotation of a compound would be reported in the scientific literature as:      e  e   (  %  )   =     α  obs   ×  100     [  α  ]   λ       fragments  e  e   fragments  normal-(  percent  normal-)         subscript  α  obs   100    subscript   delimited-[]  α   λ      ee(\%)=\frac{\alpha_{\text{obs}}\times 100}{[\alpha]_{\lambda}}     For example, if a sample of bromobutane measured under standard conditions has an observed rotation of −9.2°, this indicates that the net effect is due to (9.2°/23.1°)(100%) = 40% of the R enantiomer . The remainder of the sample is a racemic mixture of the enantiomers (30% R and 30% S), which has no net contribution to the observed rotation. The enantiomeric excess is 40%; the total concentration of R is 70%.  However, in practice the utility of this method is limited, as the presence of small amounts of highly rotating impurities can greatly affect the rotation of a given sample. Moreover, the optical rotation of a compound may be non-linearly dependent on its enantiomeric excess because of aggregation in solution. For these reasons other methods of determining the enantiomeric ratio, such as gas chromatography or HPLC with a chiral column, are generally preferred.  Absolute configuration  The variation of specific rotation with wavelength is called optical rotatory dispersion (ORD). ORD can be used in conjunction with computational methods to determine the absolute configuration of certain compounds. 11  References  External links   Specific rotation calculator   "         ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
