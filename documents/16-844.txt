Draft:Sheaf (infinity category)

Given an ∞-category C that admits limits and given the category Sch of quasi-projective schemes over a field k equipped with the étale topology, a functor F: Schop →C is called a sheaf if

(1) The F of the empty set is the terminal object of C.
(2) For any increasing sequence 
 
 
 
  of open subsets with union U, the canonical map 
 
 
 
  is an equivalence.
(3) 
 
 
 
  is the pullback of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .

If C is the nerve of a category, then the notion reduces to the usual one. The sheaves form a full subcategory of Fun(Schop, C). The left adjoint of this inclusion of sheaves is called the sheafification functor.
Examples

Given a finite abelian group M, let 
 
 
 
  denote the constant presheaf given by M; i.e., 
 
 
 
  consists of locally constant functions X →M. Unlike the classical case, it is not a sheaf. The sheafification of 
 
 
 
  is then denoted by 
 
 
 
 . By Dold–Kan, 
 
 
 
  can be identified, up to equivalence, with the injective resolution of M applied to X; in other words, the cohomology of 
 
 
 
  is the usual étale cohomology of X with coefficients in the constant étale sheaf M."
