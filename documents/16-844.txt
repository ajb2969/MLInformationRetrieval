   Draft:Sheaf (infinity category)      Draft:Sheaf (infinity category)   Given an ∞-category C that admits limits and given the category Sch of quasi-projective schemes over a field k equipped with the étale topology , a functor F : Sch op → C is called a sheaf if   (1) The F of the empty set is the terminal object of C .  (2) For any increasing sequence    U  i     subscript  U  i    U_{i}   of open subsets with union U , the canonical map     F   (  U  )    →    lim  ←    F   (   U  i   )        normal-→    F  U    projective-limit    F   subscript  U  i       F(U)\to\underleftarrow{\lim}F(U_{i})   is an equivalence.  (3)    F   (   U  ∩  V   )       F    U  V     F(U\cap V)   is the pullback of     F   (   U  ∪  V   )    →   F   (  U  )       normal-→    F    U  V      F  U     F(U\cup V)\to F(U)   and     F   (   U  ∪  V   )    →   F   (  V  )       normal-→    F    U  V      F  V     F(U\cup V)\to F(V)   .   If C is the nerve of a category, then the notion reduces to the usual one. The sheaves form a full subcategory of Fun( Sch op , C ). The left adjoint of this inclusion of sheaves is called the sheafification functor .  Examples   Given a finite abelian group M , let    c  M     subscript  c  M    c_{M}   denote the constant presheaf given by M ; i.e.,     c  M    (  X  )        subscript  c  M   X    c_{M}(X)   consists of locally constant functions X → M . Unlike the classical case, it is not a sheaf. The sheafification of    c  M     subscript  c  M    c_{M}   is then denoted by     C  *    (  -  ;  M  )        superscript  C      M     C^{*}(-;M)   . By Dold–Kan ,     C  *    (  X  ;  M  )        superscript  C     X  M     C^{*}(X;M)   can be identified, up to equivalence, with the injective resolution of M applied to X ; in other words, the cohomology of     C  *    (  X  ;  M  )        superscript  C     X  M     C^{*}(X;M)   is the usual étale cohomology of X with coefficients in the constant étale sheaf M ."
