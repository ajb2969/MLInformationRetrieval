   Alkylamidase      Alkylamidase   In enzymology , an alkylamidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-methylhexanamide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   hexanoate + methylamine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-methylhexanamide and H 2 O , whereas its two products are hexanoate and methylamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-methylhexanamide amidohydrolase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
