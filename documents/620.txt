   Moment measure      Moment measure   In probability and statistics , a moment measure is a mathematical quantity, function or, more precisely, measure that is defined in relation to mathematical objects known as point processes , which are types of stochastic processes often used as mathematical models of physical phenomena representable as randomly positioned points in time , space or both. Moment measures generalize the idea of (raw) moments of random variables , hence arise often in the study of point processes and related fields. D. J. Daley and D. Vere-Jones.

An example of a moment measure is the first moment measure or intensity measure of a point process, which gives the expected or average number of points of the point process being located in some region of space. 1 In other words, if the number of points of a point process located in some region of space is a random variable, then the first moment measure corresponds to the first moment of this random variable. 2  Moment measures feature prominently in the study of point processes 3 D.

Since these processes are often used to represent collections of points randomly scattered in space, time or both, the underlying space is usually d -dimensional Euclidean space denoted here by    ùêë  d     superscript  R  d    \textstyle\textbf{R}^{d}   , but they can be defined on more abstract mathematical spaces. 9  Point processes have a number of interpretations, which is reflected by the various types of point process notation . 10 F.

For example, if a point   x   x   \textstyle x   belongs to or is a member of a point process, denoted by   N   N   \textstyle{N}   , then this can be written as: 11       x  ‚àà  N   ,      x  N    \textstyle x\in{N},     and represents the point process being interpreted as a random set . Alternatively, the number of points of   N   N   \textstyle{N}   located in some Borel set    B   B   \textstyle B   is often written as: 12 13 14       N   (  B  )    ,      N  B    \textstyle{N}(B),     which reflects a random measure interpretation for point processes. These two notations are often used in parallel or interchangeably. 15 16 17  Definitions  n -th power of a point process  For some integer     n  =   1  ,  2  ,  ‚Ä¶       n   1  2  normal-‚Ä¶     \textstyle n=1,2,\dots   , the   n   n   \textstyle n   -th power of a point process   N   N   \textstyle{N}   is defined as: F.

N  n    (    B  1   √ó  ‚ãØ  √ó   B  n    )    =    ‚àè   i  =  1   n    N   (   B  i   )            superscript  N  n      subscript  B  1   normal-‚ãØ   subscript  B  n       superscript   subscript  product    i  1    n     N   subscript  B  i       {N}^{n}(B_{1}\times\cdots\times B_{n})=\prod_{i=1}^{n}{N}(B_{i})     where     B  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   B  n       subscript  B  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  B  n     \textstyle B_{1},...,B_{n}   is a collection of not necessarily disjoint Borel sets (in    ùêë  d     superscript  R  d    \textstyle\textbf{R}^{d}   ), which form a   n   n   \textstyle n   -fold Cartesian product of sets denoted by     B  1   √ó  ,  ‚Ä¶  ,  √ó   B  n      fragments   subscript  B  1    normal-,  normal-‚Ä¶  normal-,    subscript  B  n     B_{1}\times,\dots,\times B_{n}   . The symbol   Œ†   normal-Œ†   \textstyle\Pi   denotes standard multiplication .  The notation    N   (   B  i   )       N   subscript  B  i     \textstyle{N}(B_{i})   reflects the interpretation of the point process   N   N   \textstyle{N}   as a random measure. 18  The   n   n   \textstyle n   -th power of a point process   N   N   \textstyle{N}   can be equivalently defined as: 19        N  n    (    B  1   √ó  ‚ãØ  √ó   B  n    )    =    ‚àë    (   x  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  n   )   ‚àà  N      ‚àè   i  =  1   n     ùüè   B  i     (   x  i   )             superscript  N  n      subscript  B  1   normal-‚ãØ   subscript  B  n       subscript       subscript  x  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  n    N      superscript   subscript  product    i  1    n      subscript  1   subscript  B  i     subscript  x  i        {N}^{n}(B_{1}\times\cdots\times B_{n})=\sum_{(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})\in{N}}\prod_{%
 i=1}^{n}\mathbf{1}_{B_{i}}(x_{i})     where summation is performed over all   n   n   \textstyle n   - tuples of (possibly repeating) points, and   ùüè   1   \textstyle\mathbf{1}   denotes an indicator function such that    ùüè   B  1      subscript  1   subscript  B  1     \textstyle\mathbf{1}_{B_{1}}   is a Dirac measure . This definition can be contrasted with the definition of the n -factorial power of a point process for which each n - tuples consists of n points.  n -th moment measure  The   n   n   \textstyle n   -th moment measure is defined as:         M  n    (    B  1   √ó  ‚Ä¶  √ó   B  n    )    =   E   [    N  n    (    B  1   √ó  ‚Ä¶  √ó   B  n    )    ]     ,         superscript  M  n      subscript  B  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  B  n       E   delimited-[]     superscript  N  n      subscript  B  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  B  n         M^{n}(B_{1}\times\ldots\times B_{n})=E[{N}^{n}(B_{1}\times\ldots\times B_{n})],     where the E denotes the expectation ( operator ) of the point process   N   N   \textstyle{N}   . In other words, the n -th moment measure is the expectation of the n -th power of some point process.  The    n    n   \textstyle n\,   th moment measure of a point process   N   N   \textstyle{N}   is equivalently defined 20 as:         ‚à´   ùêë   n  d      f   (   x  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  n   )    M  n    (   d   x  1    ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   d   x  n    )     =   E   [    ‚àë    (   x  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  n   )   ‚àà  N     f   (   x  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  n   )     ]     ,        subscript    superscript  R    n  d       f    subscript  x  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  n     superscript  M  n      d   subscript  x  1    normal-‚Ä¶    d   subscript  x  n         E   delimited-[]    subscript       subscript  x  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  n    N      f    subscript  x  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  n          \int_{\textbf{R}^{nd}}f(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})M^{n}(dx_{1},\dots,dx_{n})=E\left[%
 \sum_{(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})\in{N}}f(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})\right],     where   f   f   \textstyle f   is any non-negative  measurable function on    ùêë   n  d      superscript  R    n  d     \textstyle\textbf{R}^{nd}   and the sum is over   n   n   \textstyle n   - tuples of points for which repetition is allowed.  First moment measure  For some Borel set B , the first moment of a point process N is:         M  1    (  B  )    =   E   [   N   (  B  )    ]     ,         superscript  M  1   B     E   delimited-[]    N  B       M^{1}(B)=E[{N}(B)],     where    M  1     superscript  M  1    \textstyle M^{1}   is known, among other terms, as the intensity measure 21 or mean measure , J. F. C. Kingman. Poisson processes , volume 3. Oxford university press, 1992.  and is interpreted as the expected or average number of points of   N   N   \textstyle{N}   found or located in the set   B   B   \textstyle B   .  Second moment measure  The second moment measure for two Borel sets   A   A   \textstyle A   and   B   B   \textstyle B   is:         M  2    (   A  √ó  B   )    =   E   [   N   (  A  )   N   (  B  )    ]     ,         superscript  M  2     A  B      E   delimited-[]    N  A  N  B       M^{2}(A\times B)=E[{N}(A){N}(B)],     which for a single Borel set   B   B   \textstyle B   becomes         M  2    (  B  )    =     (   E   [   N   (  B  )    ]    )   2   +   Var   [   N   (  B  )    ]      ,         superscript  M  2   B      superscript    E   delimited-[]    N  B     2     Var   delimited-[]    N  B        M^{2}(B)=(E[{N}(B)])^{2}+\text{Var}[{N}(B)],     where    Var   [   N   (  B  )    ]       Var   delimited-[]    N  B      \textstyle\text{Var}[{N}(B)]   denotes the variance of the random variable    N   (  B  )       N  B    \textstyle{N}(B)   .  The previous variance term alludes to how moments measures, like moments of random variables, can be used to calculate quantities like the variance of point processes. A further example is the covariance of a point process   N   N   \textstyle{N}   for two Borel sets   A   A   \textstyle A   and   B   B   \textstyle B   , which is given by: 22       Cov   [   N   (  A  )    ,   N   (  B  )    ]    =     M  2    (   A  √ó  B   )    -    M  1    (  A  )    M  1    (  B  )           Cov     N  A     N  B          superscript  M  2     A  B       superscript  M  1   A   superscript  M  1   B      \text{Cov}[{N}(A),{N}(B)]=M^{2}(A\times B)-M^{1}(A)M^{1}(B)     Example: Poisson point process  For a general Poisson point process with intensity measure   Œõ   normal-Œõ   \textstyle\Lambda   the first moment measure is: 23         M  1    (  B  )    =   Œõ   (  B  )     ,         superscript  M  1   B     normal-Œõ  B     M^{1}(B)=\Lambda(B),     which for a homogeneous Poisson point process with constant intensity   Œª   Œª   \textstyle\lambda   means:         M  1    (  B  )    =   Œª   |  B  |     ,         superscript  M  1   B     Œª    B      M^{1}(B)=\lambda|B|,     where    |  B  |      B    \textstyle|B|   is the length, area or volume (or more generally, the Lebesgue measure ) of   B   B   \textstyle B   .  For the Poisson case with measure   Œõ   normal-Œõ   \textstyle\Lambda   the second moment measure is: 24         M  2    (  B  )    =    Œõ   (  B  )    +   Œõ    (  B  )   2      .         superscript  M  2   B       normal-Œõ  B     normal-Œõ   superscript  B  2       M^{2}(B)=\Lambda(B)+\Lambda(B)^{2}.     which in the homogeneous case reduces to         M  2    (  B  )    =    Œª   |  B  |    +    (   Œª   |  B  |    )   2     .         superscript  M  2   B       Œª    B     superscript    Œª    B    2      M^{2}(B)=\lambda|B|+(\lambda|B|)^{2}.
