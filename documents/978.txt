   Hydroxylamine dehydrogenase      Hydroxylamine dehydrogenase   Hydroxylamine dehydrogenase (, HAO (ambiguous) ) is an enzyme with system name hydroxylamine:ferricytochrome-c oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 4 5 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) hydroxylamine + H 2 O + 2 ferricytochrome c   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   nitrite + 2 ferrocytochrome c + 5 H +   (2) hydroxylamine + ferricytochrome c   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    nitric oxide + ferrocytochrome c + 3 H +    The enzymes from the nitrifying bacterium  Nitrosomonas europaea and the methylotrophic bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus are hemoproteins .
