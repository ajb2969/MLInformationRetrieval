   Essential singularity      Essential singularity     In complex analysis , an essential singularity of a function is a "severe" singularity near which the function exhibits odd behavior.  The category essential singularity is a "left-over" or default group of singularities that are especially unmanageable: by definition they fit into neither of the other two categories of singularity that may be dealt with in some manner – removable singularities and poles .  Formal description  Consider an open subset  U of the complex plane  C . Let a be an element of U , and f : U \ { a } → C a meromorphic function . The point a is called an essential singularity of the function f if the singularity is neither a pole nor a removable singularity .  For example, the function f ( z ) = e 1/ z has an essential singularity at z = 0.  Alternate descriptions  Let a be a complex number, assume that f ( z ) is not defined at a but is analytic in some region U of the complex plane, and that every open  neighbourhood of a has non-empty intersection with U .  If both       lim   z  →  a     f   (  z  )        subscript    normal-→  z  a      f  z     \lim_{z\to a}f(z)   and     lim   z  →  a     1   f   (  z  )         subscript    normal-→  z  a      1    f  z      \lim_{z\to a}\frac{1}{f(z)}   exist, then a is a removable singularity of both f and 1/ f .  If       lim   z  →  a     f   (  z  )        subscript    normal-→  z  a      f  z     \lim_{z\to a}f(z)   exists but     lim   z  →  a     1   f   (  z  )         subscript    normal-→  z  a      1    f  z      \lim_{z\to a}\frac{1}{f(z)}   does not exist, then a is a zero of f and a pole of 1/ f .  Similarly, if       lim   z  →  a     f   (  z  )        subscript    normal-→  z  a      f  z     \lim_{z\to a}f(z)   does not exist but     lim   z  →  a     1   f   (  z  )         subscript    normal-→  z  a      1    f  z      \lim_{z\to a}\frac{1}{f(z)}   exists, then a is a pole of f and a zero of 1/ f .  If neither       lim   z  →  a     f   (  z  )        subscript    normal-→  z  a      f  z     \lim_{z\to a}f(z)   nor     lim   z  →  a     1   f   (  z  )         subscript    normal-→  z  a      1    f  z      \lim_{z\to a}\frac{1}{f(z)}   exists, then a is an essential singularity of both f and 1/ f .  Another way to characterize an essential singularity is that the Laurent series of f at the point a has infinitely many negative degree terms (i.e., the principal part of the Laurent series is an infinite sum). A related definition is that if there is a point   a   a   a   for which    f   (  z  )     (   z  -  a   )   n       f  z   superscript    z  a   n     f(z)(z-a)^{n}   is not differentiable for any integer    n  >  0      n  0    n>0   , then   a   a   a   is an essential singularity of    f   (  z  )       f  z    f(z)   . 1  The behavior of holomorphic functions near their essential singularities is described by the Casorati–Weierstrass theorem and by the considerably stronger Picard's great theorem . The latter says that in every neighborhood of an essential singularity a , the function f takes on every complex value, except possibly one, infinitely many times.  References   Lars V.
