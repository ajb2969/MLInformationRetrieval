   Strong pseudoprime      Strong pseudoprime   In number theory , a probable prime is a number that passes a primality test . A strong probable prime is a number that passes a strong version of a primality test. A strong pseudoprime is a composite number that passes a strong version of a primality test. All primes pass these tests, but a small fraction of composites also pass, making them " false primes ".  Unlike the Fermat pseudoprimes , for which there exist numbers that are pseudoprimes to all coprime bases (the Carmichael numbers ), there are no composites that are strong pseudoprimes to all bases.  Formal definition  Formally, a composite number n = d · 2 s + 1 with d being odd is called a strong (Fermat) pseudoprime to a relatively prime base a when one of the following conditions holds:       a  d   ≡   1  mod  n        superscript  a  d    modulo  1  n     a^{d}\equiv 1\mod n   or         a   d  ⋅   2  r     ≡    -  1   mod  n      for some  0   ≤  r  <  s    .     formulae-sequence     superscript  a   normal-⋅  d   superscript  2  r      modulo    1   n          for some  0   r       s      a^{d\cdot 2^{r}}\equiv-1\mod n\quad\mbox{ for some }0\leq r     (If a number n satisfies one of the above conditions and we don't yet know whether it is prime, it is more precise to refer to it as a strong probable prime to base a . But if we know that n is not prime, then one may use the term strong pseudoprime.)  The definition of a strong pseudoprime depends on the base used; different bases have different strong pseudoprimes. The definition is trivially met if so these trivial bases are often excluded.  Guy mistakenly gives a definition with only the first condition, which is not satisfied by all primes. 1  Properties of strong pseudoprimes  A strong pseudoprime to base a is always an Euler-Jacobi pseudoprime , an Euler pseudoprime  2 and a Fermat pseudoprime to that base, but not all Euler and Fermat pseudoprimes are strong pseudoprimes. Carmichael numbers may be strong pseudoprimes to some bases—for example, 561 is a strong pseudoprime to base 50—but not to all bases.  A composite number n is a strong pseudoprime to at most one quarter of all bases below n ; 3 4 thus, there are no "strong Carmichael numbers", numbers that are strong pseudoprimes to all bases. Thus given a random base, the probability that a number is a strong pseudoprime to that base is less than 1/4, forming the basis of the widely used Miller-Rabin primality test . However, Arnault 5 gives a 397-digit composite number that is a strong pseudoprime to every base less than 307. One way to prevent such a number from wrongfully being declared probably prime is to combine a strong probable prime test with a Lucas probable prime test, as in the Baillie-PSW primality test .  There are infinitely many strong pseudoprimes to any base. 6  Examples  The first strong pseudoprimes to base 2 are   2047, 3277, 4033, 4681, 8321, 15841, 29341, 42799, 49141, 52633, 65281, 74665, 80581, 85489, 88357, 90751, ... .   The first to base 3 are   121, 703, 1891, 3281, 8401, 8911, 10585, 12403, 16531, 18721, 19345, 23521, 31621, 44287, 47197, 55969, 63139, 74593, 79003, 82513, 87913, 88573, 97567, ... .   The first to base 5 are   781, 1541, 5461, 5611, 7813, 13021, 14981, 15751, 24211, 25351, 29539, 38081, 40501, 44801, 53971, 79381, ... .   For base 4, see , and for base 6 to 100, see  to .  By testing the above conditions to several bases, one gets somewhat more powerful primality tests than by using one base alone. For example, there are only 13 numbers less than 25·10 9 that are strong pseudoprimes to bases 2, 3, and 5 simultaneously. They are listed in Table 7 of. 7 The smallest such number is 25326001. This means that, if n is less than 25326001 and n is a strong probable prime to bases 2, 3, and 5, then n is prime.  Carrying this further, 3825123056546413051 is the smallest number that is a strong pseudoprime to the 9 bases 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23. 8  9 So, if n is less than 3825123056546413051 and n is a strong probable prime to these 9 bases, then n is prime.  By removing the restriction of using the first n prime bases, even better tests can be constructed, requiring at most 7 bases to conclusively test all 64-bit inputs. 10  Looking at the first strong pseudoprime to increasing single bases, we find the following least strong pseudoprime to bases 2 to 100:   2047, 121, 341, 781, 217, 25, 9, 91, 9, 133, 91, 85, 15, 1687, 15, 9, 25, 9, 21, 221, 21, 169, 25, 217, 9, 121, 9, 15, 49, 15, 25, 545, 33, 9, 35, 9, 39, 133, 39, 21, 451, 21, 9, 481, 9, 65, 49, 25, 49, 25, 51, 9, 55, 9, 55, 25, 57, 15, 481, 15, 9, 529, 9, 33, 65, 33, 25, 35, 69, 9, 85, 9, 15, 91, 15, 39, 77, 39, 9, 91, 9, 21, 85, 21, 85, 247, 87, 9, 91, 9, 91, 25, 93, 1891, 95, 49, 9, 25, 9   References  "  Category:Pseudoprimes     Guy , Pseudoprimes.
