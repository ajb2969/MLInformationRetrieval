Signal magnitude area

In mathematics, the signal magnitude area (abbreviated SMA or sma) is a statistical measure of the magnitude of a varying quantity.
Definition
The SMA value of a set of values (or a continuous-time waveform) is the normalized integral of the original values. 1 2
In the case of a set of n values 
 
 
 
  matching a time length T, the SMA



In the continuous domain, we have for example, with a 3-axis signal with an offset correction a for each axis, the following equation:3
