   Glutamine—phenylpyruvate transaminase      Glutamine—phenylpyruvate transaminase   In enzymology , a glutamine-phenylpyruvate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-glutamine + phenylpyruvate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-oxoglutaramate + L-phenylalanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-glutamine and phenylpyruvate , whereas its two products are 2-oxoglutaramate and L-phenylalanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , to be specific, the transaminases , that transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutamine:phenylpyruvate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include glutamine transaminase K , and glutamine-phenylpyruvate aminotransferase . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
