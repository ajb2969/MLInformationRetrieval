Quadratic integrate and fire

The quadratic integrate and fire (QIF) model is a biological neuron model model and a type of integrate-and-fire neuron which describes action potentials in neurons. In contrast to physiologically accurate but computationally expensive neuron models like the Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model, the QIF model seeks only to produce action potential-like patterns and ignores subtleties like gating variables, which play an important role in generating action potentials in a real neuron. However, the QIF model is incredibly easy to implement and compute, and relatively straightforward to study and understand, thus has found ubiquitous use in computational neuroscience .
A quadratic integrate and fire neuron is defined by the autonomous differential equation,



where 
 
 
 
  is a real positive constant. Note that a solution to this differential equation is the tangent function, which blows up in finite time. Thus a "spike" is said to have occurred when the solution reaches positive infinity, and the solution is reset to negative infinity.
When implementing this model in computers, a threshold crossing value (
 
 
 
 ) and a reset value (
 
 
 
 
 ) is assigned, so that when the solution rises above the threshold, 
 
 
 
 , the solution is immediately reset to
