   Quadratic integrate and fire      Quadratic integrate and fire   The quadratic integrate and fire (QIF) model is a biological neuron model model and a type of integrate-and-fire neuron which describes action potentials in neurons. In contrast to physiologically accurate but computationally expensive neuron models like the Hodgkin–Huxley model , the QIF model seeks only to produce action potential -like patterns and ignores subtleties like gating variables, which play an important role in generating action potentials in a real neuron. However, the QIF model is incredibly easy to implement and compute, and relatively straightforward to study and understand, thus has found ubiquitous use in computational neuroscience .  A quadratic integrate and fire neuron is defined by the autonomous differential equation ,        d  x    d  t    =    x  2   +  I           d  x     d  t       superscript  x  2   I     \frac{dx}{dt}=x^{2}+I     where   I   I   I   is a real positive constant. Note that a solution to this differential equation is the tangent function, which blows up in finite time. Thus a "spike" is said to have occurred when the solution reaches positive infinity, and the solution is reset to negative infinity.  When implementing this model in computers, a threshold crossing value (    V  t     subscript  V  t    V_{t}   ) and a reset value (    V  r     subscript  V  r    V_{r}   ) is assigned, so that when the solution rises above the threshold,     x   (  t  )    ≥   V  t         x  t    subscript  V  t     x(t)\geq V_{t}   , the solution is immediately reset to    V  r     subscript  V  r    V_{r}     "  Category:Computational neuroscience  Category:Mathematical modeling  Category:Nonlinear systems
