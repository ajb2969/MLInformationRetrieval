Base change map

In mathematics, the base change map relates the direct image and the pull-back of sheaves. More precisely, it is the following natural transformation of sheaves:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are continuous maps between topological spaces that form a Cartesian square and 
 
 
 
  is a sheaf on X.
In general topology, the map is an isomorphism under some mild technical conditions. An analogous result holds for étale cohomologies (with topological spaces replaced by sites), though more difficult. See proper base change theorem.
General topology
If X is a Hausdorff topological space, S is a locally compact Hausdorff space and f is universally closed (i.e., 
 
 
 
  is closed for any continuous map 
 
 
 
 ), then the base change map is an isomorphism.1 Indeed, we have: for 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  and so for 
 
 




Derivation
Since 
 
 
 
  is left adjoint to 
 
 
 
 , we have:


 
  and so


 
  The Grothendieck spectral sequence then gives the first map and the last map (they are edge maps) in:


 
  Combining this with the above we get


 
  Again using the adjoint relation we get the desired map.
