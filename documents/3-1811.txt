Szemerédi's theorem

Szemerédi's theorem is a result in arithmetic combinatorics, concerning arithmetic progressions in subsets of the integers. In 1936, Erdős and Turán conjectured1 that every set of integers A with positive natural density contains a k term arithmetic progression for every k. This conjecture, which became Szemerédi's theorem, generalizes the statement of van der Waerden's theorem.
Statement
A subset A of the natural numbers is said to have positive upper density if


 
 .
Szemerédi's theorem asserts that a subset of the natural numbers with positive upper density contains infinite arithmetic progressions of length k for all positive integers k.
An often-used equivalent finitary version of the theorem states that for every positive integer k and real number 
 
 
 
 , there exists a positive integer



such that every subset of {1, 2, ..., N} of size at least δN contains an arithmetic progression of length k.
Another formulation uses the function rk(N), the size of the largest subset of {1, 2, ..., N} without an arithmetic progression of length k. Szemerédi's theorem is equivalent to the asymptotic bound


 
 .
That is, rk(N) grows less than linearly with N.
History
The cases k = 1 and k = 2 are trivial. The case k = 3 was established in 1953 by Klaus Roth2 via an adaptation of the Hardy–Littlewood circle method. The case k = 4 was established in 1969 by Endre Szemerédi3 via a combinatorial method. Using an approach similar to the one he used for the case k = 3, Roth4 gave a second proof for this in 1972.
Finally, the case of general k was settled in 1975, also by Szemerédi,5 via an ingenious and complicated extension of the previous combinatorial argument (called "a masterpiece of combinatorial reasoning" by Erdős6). Several further proofs are now known, the most important amongst them being those by Hillel Furstenberg78 in 1977, using ergodic theory, and by Timothy Gowers9 in 2001, using both Fourier analysis and combinatorics. Terence Tao has called the various proofs of Szemerédi's theorem a "Rosetta stone" for connecting disparate fields of mathematics.10
Quantitative bounds
It is an open problem to determine the exact growth rate of rk(N). The best known general bounds are


 
 .
The lower bound is due to O'Bryant11 building on the work of Behrend,12 Rankin,13 and Elkin.1415 The upper bound is due to Gowers.16
For small k, there are tighter bounds than the general case. When k = 3, Bourgain,1718 Heath-Brown,19 Szemerédi,20 and Sanders21 provided increasingly smaller upper bounds. The current best bounds are



due to O'Bryant22 and Bloom23 respectively.
For k = 4, Green and Tao24 proved the bound



for some c > 0.
Extensions and generalizations
A multidimensional generalization of Szemerédi's theorem was first proven by Furstenberg and Katznelson using ergodic theory.25 Gowers,26 Rödl-Skokan2728 with Nagle-Rödl-Schacht,29 and Tao30 provided combinatorial proofs.
Leibman and Bergelson31 generalized Szemerédi's to polynomial progressions: If 
 
 
 
  is a set with positive upper density and 
 
 
 
  are integer-valued polynomials such that 
 
 
 
 , then there are infinitely many 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . Leibman and Bergelson's result also holds in a multidimensional setting.
The finitary version of Szemerédi's theorem can be generalized to finite additive groups including vector spaces over finite fields.32 The finite field analog can be used as a model for understanding the theorem in the natural numbers.33
The Green–Tao theorem asserts the prime numbers contain arbitrary long arithmetic progressions. It is not implied by Szemerédi's theorem because the primes have density 0 in the natural numbers. As part of their proof, Green and Tao introduced a relative Szemerédi which applies to subsets of the integers (even those with 0 density) satisfying certain pseudorandomness conditions. A more general relative Szemerédi theorem has since been given by Conlon, Fox, and Zhao.3435
The Erdős conjecture on arithmetic progressions would imply both Szemerédi's theorem and the Green–Tao theorem.
