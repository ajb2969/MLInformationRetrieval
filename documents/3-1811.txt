   Szemerédi's theorem      Szemerédi's theorem   Szemerédi's theorem is a result in arithmetic combinatorics , concerning arithmetic progressions in subsets of the integers. In 1936, Erdős and Turán conjectured 1 that every set of integers A with positive natural density contains a k term arithmetic progression for every k . This conjecture, which became Szemerédi's theorem, generalizes the statement of van der Waerden's theorem .  Statement  A subset A of the natural numbers is said to have positive upper density if        lim sup   n  →  ∞      |   A  ∩   {  1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  …  ,  n  }    |   n    >  0        subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n           A   1  2  3  normal-…  n     n    0    \limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{|A\cap\{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}|}{n}>0   .  Szemerédi's theorem asserts that a subset of the natural numbers with positive upper density contains infinite arithmetic progressions of length k for all positive integers k .  An often-used equivalent finitary version of the theorem states that for every positive integer k and real number    δ  ∈   (  0  ,  1  ]       δ   0  1     \delta\in(0,1]   , there exists a positive integer      N  =   N   (  k  ,  δ  )        N    N   k  δ      N=N(k,\delta)\,     such that every subset of {1, 2, ..., N } of size at least δ N contains an arithmetic progression of length k .  Another formulation uses the function r k ( N ), the size of the largest subset of {1, 2, ..., N } without an arithmetic progression of length k . Szemerédi's theorem is equivalent to the asymptotic bound        r  k    (  N  )    =   o   (  N  )           subscript  r  k   N     o  N     r_{k}(N)=o(N)   .  That is, r k ( N ) grows less than linearly with N .  History  The cases k = 1 and k = 2 are trivial. The case k = 3 was established in 1953 by Klaus Roth 2 via an adaptation of the Hardy–Littlewood circle method . The case k = 4 was established in 1969 by Endre Szemerédi 3 via a combinatorial method. Using an approach similar to the one he used for the case k = 3, Roth 4 gave a second proof for this in 1972.  Finally, the case of general k was settled in 1975, also by Szemerédi, 5 via an ingenious and complicated extension of the previous combinatorial argument (called "a masterpiece of combinatorial reasoning" by Erdős 6 ). Several further proofs are now known, the most important amongst them being those by Hillel Furstenberg 7 8 in 1977, using ergodic theory , and by Timothy Gowers 9 in 2001, using both Fourier analysis and combinatorics . Terence Tao has called the various proofs of Szemerédi's theorem a " Rosetta stone " for connecting disparate fields of mathematics. 10  Quantitative bounds  It is an open problem to determine the exact growth rate of r k ( N ). The best known general bounds are       C  N   exp   (    -   n   2    (   n  -  1   )   /  2      log  N   n     +    1   2  n     log   log  N      )     ≤    r  k    (  N  )    ≤   N    (   log   log  N    )    2   -   2   k  +  9                C  N          n   superscript  2      n  1   2       n     N          1    2  n        N           subscript  r  k   N          N   superscript      N     superscript  2     superscript  2    k  9           CN\exp(-n2^{(n-1)/2}\sqrt[n]{\log N}+\frac{1}{2n}\log\log N)\leq r_{k}(N)\leq%
 \frac{N}{(\log\log N)^{2^{-2^{k+9}}}}   .  The lower bound is due to O'Bryant 11 building on the work of Behrend , 12  Rankin , 13 and Elkin. 14 15 The upper bound is due to Gowers. 16  For small k , there are tighter bounds than the general case. When k = 3, Bourgain , 17 18 Heath-Brown, 19 Szemerédi, 20 and Sanders 21 provided increasingly smaller upper bounds. The current best bounds are       N   2   -    8   log  N        ≤    r  3    (  N  )    ≤   C     (   log   log  N    )   4    log  N    N           N   superscript  2        8    N           subscript  r  3   N          C     superscript      N    4     N    N      N2^{-\sqrt{8\log N}}\leq r_{3}(N)\leq C\frac{(\log\log N)^{4}}{\log N}N     due to O'Bryant 22 and Bloom 23 respectively.  For k = 4, Green and Tao 24 proved the bound        r  4    (  N  )    ≤   C   N   e   c    log   log  N                subscript  r  4   N     C    N   superscript  e    c        N           r_{4}(N)\leq C\frac{N}{e^{c\sqrt{\log\log N}}}     for some c > 0.  Extensions and generalizations  A multidimensional generalization of Szemerédi's theorem was first proven by Furstenberg and Katznelson using ergodic theory. 25 Gowers, 26 Rödl-Skokan 27 28 with Nagle-Rödl-Schacht, 29 and Tao 30 provided combinatorial proofs.  Leibman and Bergelson 31 generalized Szemerédi's to polynomial progressions: If    A  ⊂  ℕ      A  ℕ    A\subset\mathbb{N}   is a set with positive upper density and      p  1    (  n  )    ,    p  2    (  n  )    ,  …  ,    p  k    (  n  )          subscript  p  1   n      subscript  p  2   n   normal-…     subscript  p  k   n     p_{1}(n),p_{2}(n),\ldots,p_{k}(n)   are integer-valued polynomials such that      p  i    (  k  )    =  0         subscript  p  i   k   0    p_{i}(k)=0   , then there are infinitely many     u  ,  n   ∈  ℤ       u  n   ℤ    u,n\in\mathbb{Z}   such that     u  +    p  i    (  n  )     ∈  A        u     subscript  p  i   n    A    u+p_{i}(n)\in A   for all    1  ≤  i  ≤  k        1  i       k     1\leq i\leq k   . Leibman and Bergelson's result also holds in a multidimensional setting.  The finitary version of Szemerédi's theorem can be generalized to finite additive groups including vector spaces over finite fields . 32 The finite field analog can be used as a model for understanding the theorem in the natural numbers. 33  The Green–Tao theorem asserts the prime numbers contain arbitrary long arithmetic progressions. It is not implied by Szemerédi's theorem because the primes have density 0 in the natural numbers. As part of their proof, Green and Tao introduced a relative Szemerédi which applies to subsets of the integers (even those with 0 density) satisfying certain pseudorandomness conditions. A more general relative Szemerédi theorem has since been given by Conlon, Fox, and Zhao. 34 35  The Erdős conjecture on arithmetic progressions would imply both Szemerédi's theorem and the Green–Tao theorem.
