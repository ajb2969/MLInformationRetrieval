   Maleylacetate reductase      Maleylacetate reductase   In enzymology , a maleylacetate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-oxoadipate + NAD(P)+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-maleylacetate + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 3-oxoadipate , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are 2-maleylacetate , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-oxoadipate:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called maleolylacetate reductase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation , benzoate degradation via hydroxylation , and 1,4-dichlorobenzene degradation .
