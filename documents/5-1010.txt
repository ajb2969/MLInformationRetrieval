   Cusp neighborhood      Cusp neighborhood   In mathematics , a cusp neighborhood is defined as a set of points near a cusp .  Cusp neighborhood for a Riemann surface  The cusp neighborhood for a hyperbolic Riemann surface can be defined in terms of its Fuchsian model .  Suppose that the Fuchsian group  G contains a parabolic element g. For example, the element t ∈ SL(2, Z ) where  $$t(z)=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}:z = \frac{1\cdot z+1}{0 \cdot z + 1} = z+1$$  is a parabolic element. Note that all parabolic elements of SL(2, C ) are conjugate to this element. That is, if g ∈ SL(2, Z ) is parabolic, then $g=h^{-1}th$ for some h ∈ SL(2, Z ).  The set  $$U=\{ z \in \mathbf{H} : \Im z > 1 \}$$  where H is the upper half-plane has  $$\gamma(U) \cap U = \emptyset$$  for any $\gamma \in G - \langle g \rangle$ where $\langle g \rangle$ is understood to mean the group generated by g . That is, γ acts properly discontinuously on U . Because of this, it can be seen that the projection of U onto H / G is thus  $$E = U/ \langle g \rangle$$ .  Here, E is called the neighborhood of the cusp corresponding to g .  Note that the hyperbolic area of E is exactly 1, when computed using the canonical Poincaré metric . This is most easily seen by example: consider the intersection of U defined above with the fundamental domain  $$\left\{ z \in H: \left| z \right| > 1,\, \left| \,\mbox{Re}(z) \,\right| < \frac{1}{2} \right\}$$  of the modular group , as would be appropriate for the choice of T as the parabolic element. When integrated over the volume element  $$d\mu=\frac{dxdy}{y^2}$$  the result is trivially 1. Areas of all cusp neighborhoods are equal to this, by the invariance of the area under conjugation.
