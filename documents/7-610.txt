Subsonic tunnel
Low-speed wind tunnels are used for operations at very low Mach number, with speeds in the test section up to 480 km/h (~ 134 m/s, M = 0.4) (Barlow, Rae, Pope; 1999). They may be of open-return type (also known as the Eiffel type, see figure), or closed-return flow (also known as the Prandtl type, see figure) with air moved by a propulsion system usually consisting of large axial fans that increase the dynamic pressure to overcome the viscous losses.

The working principle is based on the continuity and Bernoulli's equation:
The continuity equation is given by:



The Bernoulli equation states:



Putting Bernoulli into the continuity equation gives:



The contraction ratio of a windtunnel can now be calculated by: 
 
 

Closed wind tunnel

In a return-flow wind tunnel the return duct must be properly designed to reduce the pressure losses and to ensure smooth flow in the test section. The compressible flow regime: Again with the continuity law, but now for isentropic flow gives:



The 1-D area-velocity is known as:



The minimal area A where M=1, also known as the sonic throat area is than given for a perfect gas:
