   Subsonic and transonic wind tunnel      Subsonic and transonic wind tunnel   (Figure)  Floor plan of Eiffel's 1912 laboratory at Auteuil, Paris, with two open-return wind tunnels   Subsonic tunnel  Low-speed wind tunnels are used for operations at very low Mach number , with speeds in the test section up to 480 km/h (~ 134 m/s , M = 0.4) (Barlow, Rae, Pope; 1999). They may be of open-return type (also known as the Eiffel type, see figure ), or closed-return flow (also known as the Prandtl type, see figure ) with air moved by a propulsion system usually consisting of large axial fans that increase the dynamic pressure to overcome the viscous losses.  Open wind tunnel  (Figure)  Schematic of an open wind tunnel with a closed test section   The working principle is based on the continuity and Bernoulli's equation :  The continuity equation is given by:       A  V   =   c  o  n  s  t  a  n  t   ⇒    d  A   A   =   -    d  V   V            A  V     c  o  n  s  t  a  n  t     normal-⇒        d  A   A              d  V   V       AV=constant\Rightarrow\frac{dA}{A}=-\frac{dV}{V}     The Bernoulli equation states:       P   t  o  t  a  l    =    P   s  t  a  t  i  c    +   P   d  y  n  a  m  i  c     =    P  s   +    1  2   ρ   V  2            subscript  P    t  o  t  a  l       subscript  P    s  t  a  t  i  c     subscript  P    d  y  n  a  m  i  c             subscript  P  s       1  2   ρ   superscript  V  2        P_{total}=P_{static}+P_{dynamic}=P_{s}+\frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}     Putting Bernoulli into the continuity equation gives:       V  m  2   =   2    C  2     C  2   -  1       P   s  e  t  t  l    -   p  m    ρ    ≈   2    Δ  p   ρ           superscript   subscript  V  m   2     2     superscript  C  2      superscript  C  2   1         subscript  P    s  e  t  t  l     subscript  p  m    ρ           2      normal-Δ  p   ρ       V_{m}^{2}=2\frac{C^{2}}{C^{2}-1}\frac{P_{settl}-p_{m}}{\rho}\approx 2\frac{%

The compressible flow regime: Again with the continuity law, but now for isentropic flow gives:       -    d  ρ   ρ    =   -    1   a  2      d  p   ρ     =   -    1   a  2      -   ρ  V  d  V    ρ     =    V   a  2    d  V               d  ρ   ρ          1   superscript  a  2        d  p   ρ                1   superscript  a  2          ρ  V  d  V    ρ              V   superscript  a  2    d  V      -\frac{d\rho}{\rho}=-\frac{1}{a^{2}}\frac{dp}{\rho}=-\frac{1}{a^{2}}\frac{-%
