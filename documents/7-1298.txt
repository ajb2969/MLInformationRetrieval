Read has also published on Banach algebras and hypercyclicity.
Read is currently a Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Leeds. He completed his PhD thesis entitled Some Problems in the Geometry of Banach Spaces at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Béla Bollobás.
Controversies
Read calls himself a born-again Christian. In a write-up on his conversion, he ends by saying:
"That's right, Jesus is the Way. But you have to find that out for yourself. For those who seek find, but those who can't be bothered, or who think they're too cool, end in a very dark place. It won't be cool in Hell."
