Acetylglutamate kinase




Acetylglutamate kinase

In enzymology, an acetylglutamate kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:

ATP + N-acetyl-L-glutamate 
 
 
 
  ADP + N-acetyl-L-glutamyl 5-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and N-acetyl-L-glutamate, whereas its two products are ADP and N-acetyl-L-glutamyl 5-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a carboxy group as acceptor. This enzyme participates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups.
Nomenclature
The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:N-acetyl-L-glutamate 5-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include:

N-acetylglutamate 5-phosphotransferase,
acetylglutamate phosphokinase,
N-acetylglutamate phosphokinase,
N-acetylglutamate kinase, and
N-acetylglutamic 5-phosphotransferase.
