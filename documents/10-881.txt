2-hexadecenal reductase

In enzymology, a 2-hexadecenal reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

hexadecanal + NADP+

 
  2-trans-hexadecenal + NADPH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are hexadecanal and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are 2-trans-hexadecenal, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hexadecanal:NADP+ Delta2-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include 2-alkenal reductase, and hexadecanal: NADP+ oxidoreductase.
