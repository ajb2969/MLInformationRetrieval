   Overlap (term rewriting)      Overlap (term rewriting)   In mathematics , computer science and logic , overlap , as a property of the reduction rules in term rewriting system , describes a situation where a number of different reduction rules specify potentially contradictory ways of reducing a reducible expression (or redex ) within a term. More precisely, if a number of different reduction rules share function symbols on the left hand side, overlap can occur. Often we do not consider trivial overlap with a redex and itself.  For example, consider the term rewriting system defined by the reduction rules        ρ  1    :    f   (   g   (  x  )    ,  y  )    →  y      normal-:   subscript  ρ  1    normal-→    f     g  x   y    y     \rho_{1}\ :\ f(g(x),y)\rightarrow y           ρ  2    :    g   (  x  )    →   f   (  x  ,  x  )        normal-:   subscript  ρ  2    normal-→    g  x     f   x  x       \rho_{2}\ :\ g(x)\rightarrow f(x,x)   The term f ( g ( x ), y ) can be reduced via ρ 1 to yield y , but it can also be reduced via ρ 2 to yield f ( f ( x , x ), y ). Note how the redex g ( x ) is contained in the redex f ( g ( x ), y ). The result of reducing different redexes is described in a critical pair —the critical pair arising out of this term rewriting system is ( f ( f ( x , x ), y ), y ).  Overlap may occur with fewer than two reduction rules. Consider the term rewriting system defined by the reduction rule        ρ  1    :    g   (   g   (  x  )    )    →  x      normal-:   subscript  ρ  1    normal-→    g    g  x    x     \rho_{1}\ :\ g(g(x))\rightarrow x   The term g ( g ( g ( x ))) has overlapping redexes, which can be either applied to the innermost occurrence or to the outermost occurrence of the g ( g ( x )) term.
