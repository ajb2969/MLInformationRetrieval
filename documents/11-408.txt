   3'(2'),5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase      3'(2'),5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase   In enzymology , a 3'(2'),5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 5'-phosphate + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are adenosine 5'-phosphate and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is adenosine-3'(2'),5'-bisphosphate 3'(2')-phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include phosphoadenylate 3'-nucleotidase , 3'-phosphoadenylylsulfate 3'-phosphatase , phosphoadenylate 3'-nucleotidase , and 3'(2'),5'-bisphosphonucleoside 3'(2')-phosphohydrolase . This enzyme participates in sulfur metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
