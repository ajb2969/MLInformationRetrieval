Draft:Tensor product of representations

If 
 
 
 
  are linear representations over a field k of a group G, then their tensor product over k is also a linear representation given by



Example: Let V be a finite-dimensional representation of G. Then 
 
 
 
  as a G-module when G acts on an endmorphism T by 
 
 
 
 .
Let E denote the endomorphism algebra of V and let A denote the subalgebra of 
 
 
 
  consisting of symmetric tensors. The main theorem of invariant theory states that A is semisimple.
Any tensor power of a vector space comes with a natural action of the symmetric group that permutes factors.
The Schurâ€“Weyl duality computes the irreducible representations occurring in tensor powers of 
 
 
 
 -modules.
