   Draft:Tensor product of representations      Draft:Tensor product of representations   If     V  1   ,   ⋯   V  n        subscript  V  1     normal-⋯   subscript  V  n      V_{1},\cdots V_{n}   are linear representations over a field k of a group G , then their tensor product over k is also a linear representation given by        g  ⋅   (    v  1   ⊗  …  ⊗   v  n    )    =     g   v  1    ⊗  …  ⊗  g    v  n     .       normal-⋅  g   tensor-product   subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  n        tensor-product    g   subscript  v  1    normal-…  g    subscript  v  n      g\cdot(v_{1}\otimes\dots\otimes v_{n})=gv_{1}\otimes\dots\otimes gv_{n}.     Example: Let V be a finite-dimensional representation of G . Then     End   (  V  )    ≃    V  *   ⊗  V      similar-to-or-equals   End  V    tensor-product   superscript  V    V     \operatorname{End}(V)\simeq V^{*}\otimes V   as a G -module when G acts on an endmorphism T by      (   g  ⋅  T   )    (  v  )    =   g  T   (    g   -  1    v   )           normal-⋅  g  T   v     g  T     superscript  g    1    v      (g\cdot T)(v)=gT(g^{-1}v)   .  Let E denote the endomorphism algebra of V and let A denote the subalgebra of    E    ⊗  m      superscript  E   tensor-product  absent  m     E^{\otimes m}   consisting of symmetric tensors. The main theorem of invariant theory states that A is semisimple .  Any tensor power of a vector space comes with a natural action of the symmetric group that permutes factors.  The Schur–Weyl duality computes the irreducible representations occurring in tensor powers of    GL   (  n  ,  ℂ  )      GL  n  ℂ    \operatorname{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})   -modules.
