Hence the red vector is said to be an eigenvector of this particular transformation and the blue vector is not.     In mathematics , an eigenvector of a transformation is a vector which that transformation simply multiplies by a constant factor, called the eigenvalue of that vector. Often, a transformation is completely described by its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenspace for a factor is the set of eigenvectors with that factor as eigenvalue.  In the specific case of linear algebra , the eigenvalue problem is this: given an n by n matrix A ,what nonzero vectors x in    R  n     superscript  R  n    R^{n}   exist, such that Ax is a scalar multiple of x ?  The scalar multiple is denoted by the Greek letter λ and is called an eigenvalue of the matrix A, while x is called the eigenvector of A corresponding to λ . These concepts play a major role in several branches of both pure and applied mathematics — appearing prominently in linear algebra , functional analysis , and to a lesser extent in nonlinear situations.  It is common to prefix any natural name for the vector with eigen instead of saying eigenvector . For example, eigenfunction if the eigenvector is a function , eigenmode if the eigenvector is a harmonic mode , eigenstate if the eigenvector is a quantum state , and so on. Similarly for the eigenvalue, e.g. eigenfrequency if the eigenvalue is (or determines) a frequency .      ...Archive   Image credit: User:Voyajer   Read more...      "
