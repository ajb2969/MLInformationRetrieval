   Sulfolactate sulfo-lyase      Sulfolactate sulfo-lyase   In enzymology , a sulfolactate sulfo-lyase (, Suy , SuyAB , 3-sulfolactate bisulfite-lyase , sulfolactate sulfo-lyase ) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-sulfolactate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyruvate + bisulfite   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 3-sulfolactate , and two products , pyruvate and bisulfite .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-sulfolactate bisulfite-lyase (pyruvate-forming) . Other names in common use include Suy , SuyAB , and 3-sulfolactate bisulfite-lyase .  References     "  Category:EC 4.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
