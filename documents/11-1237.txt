   Dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide—protein glycotransferase      Dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide—protein glycotransferase   In enzymology , a dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dolichyl diphosphooligosaccharide + protein L-asparagine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dolichyl diphosphate + a glycoprotein with the oligosaccharide chain attached by N-glycosyl linkage to protein L-asparagine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dolichyl diphosphooligosaccharide and protein L-asparagine , whereas its 3 products are dolichyl diphosphate , glycoprotein with the oligosaccharide chain attached by N-glycosyl , and linkage to protein L-asparagine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide:protein-L-asparagine oligopolysaccharidotransferase . Other names in common use include dolichyldiphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase , asparagine N-glycosyltransferase , dolichyldiphosphooligosaccharide-protein oligosaccharyltransferase , dolichylpyrophosphodiacetylchitobiose-protein glycosyltransferase , oligomannosyltransferase , oligosaccharide transferase , dolichyldiphosphoryloligosaccharide-protein , and oligosaccharyltransferase . This enzyme participates in n-glycan biosynthesis and glycan structures - biosynthesis 1 .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
