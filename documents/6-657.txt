   Ramanujan–Nagell equation      Ramanujan–Nagell equation   In mathematics , in the field of number theory , the Ramanujan–Nagell equation is an equation between a square number and a number that is seven less than a power of two . It is an example of an exponential Diophantine equation , an equation to be solved in integers where one of the variables appears as an exponent . It is named after Srinivasa Ramanujan , who conjectured that it has only five integer solutions, and after Trygve Nagell , who proved the conjecture.  Equation and solution  The equation is        2  n   -  7   =    x  2           superscript  2  n   7    superscript  x  2     2^{n}-7=x^{2}\,   and solutions in natural numbers n and x exist just when n = 3, 4, 5, 7 and 15.  This was conjectured in 1913 by Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan , proposed independently in 1943 by the Norwegian mathematician Wilhelm Ljunggren , and proved in 1948 by the Norwegian mathematician Trygve Nagell . The values on n correspond to the values of x as:-   x = 1, 3, 5, 11 and 181. 1    Triangular Mersenne numbers  The problem of finding all numbers of the form 2 b − 1 ( Mersenne numbers ) which are triangular is equivalent:        2  b   -  1   =    y   (   y  +  1   )    2          superscript  2  b   1       y    y  1    2     2^{b}-1=\frac{y(y+1)}{2}          ⇔    8   (    2  b   -  1   )    =   4  y   (   y  +  1   )        normal-⇔  absent      8     superscript  2  b   1      4  y    y  1       \Leftrightarrow 8(2^{b}-1)=4y(y+1)          ⇔     2   b  +  3    -  8   =    4   y  2    +   4  y        normal-⇔  absent       superscript  2    b  3    8       4   superscript  y  2      4  y       \Leftrightarrow 2^{b+3}-8=4y^{2}+4y          ⇔     2   b  +  3    -  7   =    4   y  2    +   4  y   +  1       normal-⇔  absent       superscript  2    b  3    7       4   superscript  y  2      4  y   1      \Leftrightarrow 2^{b+3}-7=4y^{2}+4y+1          ⇔     2   b  +  3    -  7   =    (    2  y   +  1   )   2       normal-⇔  absent       superscript  2    b  3    7    superscript      2  y   1   2      \Leftrightarrow 2^{b+3}-7=(2y+1)^{2}     The values of b are just those of n − 3, and the corresponding triangular Mersenne numbers (also known as Ramanujan–Nagell numbers ) are:        y   (   y  +  1   )    2   =     (   x  -  1   )    (   x  +  1   )    8           y    y  1    2         x  1     x  1    8     \frac{y(y+1)}{2}=\frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{8}     for x = 1, 3, 5, 11 and 181, giving 0, 1, 3, 15, 4095 and no more .  Equations of Ramanujan–Nagell type  An equation of the form        x  2   +  D   =   A   B  n           superscript  x  2   D     A   superscript  B  n      x^{2}+D=AB^{n}     for fixed D , A , B and variable x , n is said to be of Ramanujan–Nagell type . A result of Siegel implies that the number of solutions in each case is finite. 2 The equation with A =1, B =2 has at most two solutions except in the case D =7 already mentioned. There are infinitely many values of D for which there are two solutions, including    D  =    2  m   -  1       D     superscript  2  m   1     D=2^{m}-1   . 3  Equations of Lebesgue–Nagell type  An equation of the form        x  2   +  D   =   A   y  n           superscript  x  2   D     A   superscript  y  n      x^{2}+D=Ay^{n}     for fixed D , A and variable x , y , n is said to be of Lebesgue–Nagell type . Results of Shorey and Tijdeman imply that the number of solutions in each case is finite. 4  See also   Scientific equations named after people   References          External links    [ http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=419063&tstart; ;=0 Can N 2 + N - 2 Be A Power Of 2?], Math Forum discussion   "  Category:Diophantine equations  Category:Srinivasa Ramanujan     Saradha & Srinivasan (2008) p.208 ↩  Saradha & Srinivasan (2008) p.207 ↩  Saradha & Srinivasan (2008) p.208 ↩  Saradha & Srinivasan (2008) p.211 ↩
