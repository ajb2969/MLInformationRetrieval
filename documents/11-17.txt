   Tryptophanase      Tryptophanase   In enzymology , a tryptophanase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-tryptophan + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   indole + pyruvate + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-tryptophan and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are indole , pyruvate , and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically in the "catch-all" class of carbon-carbon lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-tryptophan indole-lyase (deaminating; pyruvate-forming) . Other names in common use include L-tryptophanase , and L-tryptophan indole-lyase (deaminating) . This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism and nitrogen metabolism . It has 2 cofactors : pyridoxal phosphate , and Potassium .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
