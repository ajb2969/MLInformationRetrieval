Adenylyl-(glutamate—ammonia ligase) hydrolase




Adenylyl-(glutamate—ammonia ligase) hydrolase

In enzymology, an adenylyl-[glutamate---ammonia ligase] hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

adenylyl-[L-glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming)] + H2O 
 
 
 
  adenylate + [L-glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming)]
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are adenylyl-[L-glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming)] and H2O, whereas its two products are adenylate and L-glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming).
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is adenylyl-[L-glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming)] adenylylhydrolase. Other names in common use include adenylyl-[glutamine-synthetase]hydrolase, and adenylyl(glutamine synthetase) hydrolase.
