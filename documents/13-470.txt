   Zoltán Füredi      Zoltán Füredi   Zoltán Füredi ( Budapest , Hungary , 21 May 1954) is a Hungarian mathematician, working in combinatorics , mainly in discrete geometry and extremal combinatorics. He was a student of Gyula O. H. Katona . He is a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (2004). He is a research professor of the Rényi Mathematical Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).  Füredi received his Candidate of Sciences degree in mathematics in 1981 from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. 1  Some results   In infinitely many cases he determined the maximum number of edges in a graph with no C 4 .  With Paul Erdős he proved that for some c >1, there are c d points in d -dimensional space such that all triangles formed from those points are acute .  With Imre Bárány he proved that no polynomial time algorithm determines the volume of convex bodies in dimension d within a multiplicative error d d .  He proved that there are at most    O   (   n   log  n    )       O    n    n      O(n\log n)   unit distances in a convex n-gon. 2  In a paper written with coauthors he solved the Hungarian lottery problem. 3  With I. Palásti he found the best known lower bounds on the orchard-planting problem of finding sets of points with many 3-point lines. 4   References    External links   Füredi's UIUC home page   "  Category:Hungarian mathematicians  Category:Members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences  Category:Combinatorialists  Category:University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign faculty  Category:1954 births  Category:Living people     ↩  ↩  [ http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6610(1996)4:1%3C5 ::AID-JCD2%3E3.0.CO;2-J/abstract] Reprint ↩  . ↩
