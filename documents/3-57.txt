   Wieferich prime      Wieferich prime   In number theory , a Wieferich prime is a prime number  p such that p 2 divides 2 p − 1 − 1, 1 therefore connecting these primes with Fermat's little theorem , which states that every odd prime p divides 2 p − 1 − 1. Wieferich primes were first described by Arthur Wieferich in 1909 in works pertaining to Fermat's last theorem , at which time both of Fermat's theorems were already well known to mathematicians. 2 3  Since then, connections between Wieferich primes and various other topics in mathematics have been discovered, including other types of numbers and primes, such as Mersenne and Fermat numbers, specific types of pseudoprimes and some types of numbers generalized from the original definition of a Wieferich prime. Over time, those connections discovered have extended to cover more properties of certain prime numbers as well as more general subjects such as number fields and the abc conjecture .  , the only known Wieferich primes are 1093 and 3511 .  Equivalent definitions  The stronger version of Fermat's little theorem , which a Wieferich prime satisfies, is usually expressed as a congruence relation  . From the definition of the congruence relation on integers , it follows that this property is equivalent to the definition given at the beginning. Thus if a prime p satisfies this congruence, this prime divides the Fermat quotient       2   p  -  1    -  1   p         superscript  2    p  1    1   p    \tfrac{2^{p-1}-1}{p}   . The following are two illustrative examples using the primes 11 and 1093:   For p = 11, we get      2  10   -  1   11         superscript  2  10   1   11    \tfrac{2^{10}-1}{11}   which is 93 and leaves a remainder of 5 after division by 11, hence 11 is not a Wieferich prime. For p = 1093, we get      2  1092   -  1   1093         superscript  2  1092   1   1093    \tfrac{2^{1092}-1}{1093}   or 485439490310...852893958515 (302 intermediate digits omitted for clarity), which leaves a remainder of 0 after division by 1093 and thus 1093 is a Wieferich prime.   Wieferich primes can be defined by other equivalent congruences. If p is a Wieferich prime, one can multiply both sides of the congruence 2 p -1 ≡ 1 (mod p 2 ) by 2 to get 2 p ≡ 2 (mod p 2 ). Raising both sides of the congruence to the power p shows that a Wieferich prime also satisfies 2 p 2 ≡2 p ≡ 2 (mod p 2 ), and hence 2 p k ≡ 2 (mod p 2 ) for all k ≥ 1. The converse is also true: 2 p k ≡ 2 (mod p 2 ) for some k ≥ 1 implies that the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p 2 divides gcd ( p k -1, φ ( p 2 ))= p -1, that is, 2 p -1 ≡ 1 (mod p 2 ) and thus p is a Wieferich prime. This also implies that Wieferich primes can be defined as primes p such that the multiplicative orders of 2 modulo p and modulo p 2 coincide: , (By the way, ord 1093 2 = 364, and ord 3511 2 = 1755).  H. S. Vandiver proved that if and only if     1  +   1  3   +  …  +   1   p  -  2     ≡   0     (   mod   p  2    )          1    1  3   normal-…    1    p  2      annotated  0   pmod   superscript  p  2       1+\tfrac{1}{3}+\dots+\tfrac{1}{p-2}\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{2})   . 4  History and search status  In 1902, W. F. Meyer proved a theorem about solutions of the congruence a p − 1 ≡ 1 (mod p r ). 5 Later in that decade Arthur Wieferich showed specifically that if the first case of Fermat's last theorem has solutions for an odd prime exponent, then that prime must satisfy that congruence for a = 2 and r = 2. In other words, if there exist solutions to x p + y p + z p = 0 in integers x , y , z and p an odd prime with p  ∤  xyz , then p satisfies 2 p − 1 ≡ 1 (mod p 2 ). In 1913, Bachmann examined the residues of        2   p  -  1    -  1   p    mod  p     modulo       superscript  2    p  1    1   p   p    \tfrac{2^{p-1}-1}{p}\,\bmod\,p   . He asked the question when this residue vanishes and tried to find expressions for answering this question. 6  The prime 1093 was found to be a Wieferich prime by Waldemar Meissner in 1913 and confirmed to be the only such prime below 2000. He calculated the smallest residue of        2  t   -  1   p    mod  p     modulo       superscript  2  t   1   p   p    \tfrac{2^{t}-1}{p}\,\bmod\,p   for all primes p  E. Haentzschel later ordered verification of the correctness of Meissners congruence via only elementary calculations. 7 Inspired by an earlier work of Euler , he simplified Meissners proof by showing that 1093 2 | (2 182 + 1) and remarked that (2 182 + 1) is a factor of (2 364 − 1). 8 It was also shown that it is possible to prove that 1093 is a Wieferich prime without using complex numbers contrary to the method used by Meissner, 9 although Meissner himself hinted at that he was aware of a proof without complex values. 10  The prime 3511 was first found to be a Wieferich prime by N. G. W. H. Beeger in 1922 11 and another proof of it being a Wieferich prime was published in 1965 by Guy . 12 In 1960, Kravitz 13 doubled a previous record set by Fröberg 14 and in 1961 Riesel extended the search to 500000 with the aid of BESK . 15 Around 1980, Lehmer was able to reach the search limit of 6     ×   10  9       absent   superscript  10  9     \times 10^{9}   . 16 This limit was extended to over 2.5     ×    10  1   5       absent     superscript  10  1   5     \times 10^{1}5   in 2006, 17 finally reaching 3     ×    10  1   5       absent     superscript  10  1   5     \times 10^{1}5   . It is now known, that if any other Wieferich primes exist, they must be greater than 6.7     ×    10  1   5       absent     superscript  10  1   5     \times 10^{1}5   . 18 The search for new Wieferich primes is currently performed by the distributed computing project Wieferich@Home. In December 2011, another search was started by the PrimeGrid project. 19 , PrimeGrid has extended the search limit to over 3     ×    10  1   7       absent     superscript  10  1   7     \times 10^{1}7   and continues. 20  It has been conjectured (as for Wilson primes ) that infinitely many Wieferich primes exist, and that the number of Wieferich primes below x is approximately log(log( x )), which is a heuristic result that follows from the plausible assumption that for a prime p , the ( p − 1)-th degree roots of unity modulo p 2 are uniformly distributed in the multiplicative group of integers modulo p 2 . 21  Properties  Connection with Fermat's last theorem  The following theorem connecting Wieferich primes and Fermat's last theorem was proven by Wieferich in 1909: 22   Let p be prime, and let x , y , z be integers such that x p + y p + z p = 0. Furthermore, assume that p does not divide the product  xyz . Then p is a Wieferich prime.   The above case (where p does not divide any of x , y or z ) is commonly known as the first case of Fermat's last theorem (FLTI) 23 24 and FLTI is said to fail for a prime p , if solutions to the Fermat equation exist for that p , otherwise FLTI holds for p . 25 In 1910, Mirimanoff expanded 26 the theorem by showing that, if the preconditions of the theorem hold true for some prime p , then p 2 must also divide 3 p − 1 − 1. Granville and Monagan further proved that p 2 must actually divide m p − 1 − 1 for every prime m ≤ 89. 27 Suzuki extended the proof to all primes m ≤ 113. 28  Let H p be a set of pairs of integers with 1 as their greatest common divisor , p being prime to x , y and x + y , ( x + y ) p -1 ≡ 1 (mod p 2 ), ( x + ξy ) being the p th power of an ideal of K with ξ defined as cos 2 π / p + i sin 2 π / p . K = Q ( ξ ) is the field extension obtained by adjoining all polynomials in the algebraic number  ξ to the field of rational numbers (such an extension is known as a number field or in this particular case, where ξ is a root of unity , a cyclotomic number field ). 29 From uniqueness of factorization of ideals in Q (ξ) it follows that if the first case of Fermat's last theorem has solutions x , y , z then p divides x + y + z and ( x , y ), ( y , z ) and ( z , x ) are elements of H p . 30 Granville and Monagan showed that (1, 1) ∈ H p if and only if p is a Wieferich prime. 31  Connection with the abc conjecture and non-Wieferich primes  A non-Wieferich prime is a prime p satisfying 2 p − 1 ≢ 1 (mod p 2 ). J. H. Silverman showed in 1988 that if the abc conjecture holds, then there exist infinitely many non-Wieferich primes. 32 More precisely he showed that the abc conjecture implies the existence of a constant only depending on α such that the number of non-Wieferich primes to base α with p less than or equal to a variable X is greater than log( X ) as X goes to infinity. 33 Numerical evidence suggests that very few of the prime numbers in a given interval are Wieferich primes. The set of Wieferich primes and the set of non-Wieferich primes, sometimes denoted by W 2 and W 2 c respectively, 34 are complementary sets , so if one of them is shown to be finite, the other one would necessarily have to be infinite, because both are proper subsets of the set of prime numbers. It was later shown that the existence of infinitely many non-Wieferich primes already follows from a weaker version of the abc conjecture, called the ABC-(k, ε) conjecture . 35 Additionally, the existence of infinitely many non-Wieferich primes would also follow if there exist infinitely many square-free Mersenne numbers 36 as well as if there exists a real number ξ such that the set { n ∈ N : λ(2 n − 1) \tfrac{\log n}{\log \gamma (n)} and     γ   (  n  )    =    ∏   p  ∣  n    p         γ  n     subscript  product   fragments  p  normal-∣  n    p     \gamma(n)=\prod_{p\mid n}p   , meaning    γ   (  n  )       γ  n    \gamma(n)   gives the product of all prime factors of n . 37  Connection with Mersenne and Fermat primes  It is known that the n th Mersenne number  M n = 2 n − 1 is prime only if n is prime. Fermat's little theorem implies that if p > 2 is prime, then M p −1 (= 2 p − 1 − 1) is always divisible by p . Since Mersenne numbers of prime indices M p and M q are co-prime,    A prime divisor p of M q , where q is prime, is a Wieferich prime if and only if p 2 divides M q . 38      Thus, a Mersenne prime cannot also be a Wieferich prime. A notable open problem is to determine whether or not all Mersenne numbers of prime index are square-free . If q is prime and the Mersenne number M q is not square-free, that is, there exists a prime p for which p 2 divides M q , then p is a Wieferich prime. Therefore, if there are only finitely many Wieferich primes, then there will be at most finitely many Mersenne numbers with prime index that are not square-free. Rotkiewicz showed a related result: if there are infinitely many square-free Mersenne numbers, then there are infinitely many non-Wieferich primes. 39  Similarly, if p is prime and p 2 divides some Fermat number  F n = 2 2 n + 1, then p must be a Wieferich prime. 40  In fact, if and only if there exists a natural number n and a prime p that p 2 divides     Φ  n    (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ  n   2    \Phi_{n}(2)   (where   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is Cyclotomic polynomial ), then p is a Wieferich prime. For example, 1093 2 divides     Φ  364    (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ  364   2    \Phi_{364}(2)   , 3511 2 divides     Φ  1755    (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ  1755   2    \Phi_{1755}(2)   . Mersenne and Fermat numbers are just special situations of     Φ  n    (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ  n   2    \Phi_{n}(2)   . Thus, if 1093 and 3511 are only two Wieferich primes, then all     Φ  n    (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ  n   2    \Phi_{n}(2)   are square-free except     Φ  364    (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ  364   2    \Phi_{364}(2)   and     Φ  1755    (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ  1755   2    \Phi_{1755}(2)   (In fact, when there exists a prime p which p 2 divides some     Φ  n    (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ  n   2    \Phi_{n}(2)   , then it is a Wieferich prime); and clearly, if     Φ  n    (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ  n   2    \Phi_{n}(2)   is a prime, then it cannot be Wieferich prime. (Notice any odd prime p divides only one     Φ  n    (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ  n   2    \Phi_{n}(2)   and n divides p -1, and if and only if the period length of 1/p in binary is n , then p divides     Φ  n    (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ  n   2    \Phi_{n}(2)   . Besides, if and only if p is a Wieferich prime, then the period length of 1/p and 1/p 2 are the same (in binary). Otherwise, this is p times than that.)  For the primes 1093 and 3511, it was shown that neither of them is a divisor of any Mersenne number with prime index nor a divisor of any Fermat number, because 364 and 1755 are neither prime nor powers of 2. 41  Connection with other equations  Scott and Styer showed that the equation p x – 2 y = d has at most one solution in positive integers ( x , y ), unless when p 4 | 2 ord p 2 – 1 if p ≢ 65 (mod 192) or unconditionally when p 2 | 2 ord p 2 – 1, where ord p 2 denotes the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p . 42 They also showed that a solution to the equation ±a x 1 ± 2 y 1 = ±a x 2 ± 2 y 2 = c must be from a specific set of equations but that this does not hold, if a is a Wieferich prime greater than 1.25 x 10 15 . 43  Binary periodicity of p −1  Johnson observed 44 that the two known Wieferich primes are one greater than numbers with periodic binary expansions (1092 = 010001000100 2 =444 16 ; 3510 = 110110110110 2 =6666 8 ). The Wieferich@Home project searches for Wieferich primes by testing numbers that are one greater than a number with a periodic binary expansion, but up to a "bit pseudo-length" of 3500 of the tested binary numbers generated by combination of bit strings with a bit length of up to 24 it has not found a new Wieferich prime. 45  Abundancy of p −1  It has been noted  that the known Wieferich primes are one greater than mutually friendly numbers (the shared abundancy index being 112/39).  Connection with pseudoprimes  It was observed that the two known Wieferich primes are the square factors of all non-square free base-2 Fermat pseudoprimes up to 25     ×   10  9       absent   superscript  10  9     \times 10^{9}   . 46 Later computations showed that the only repeated factors of the pseudoprimes up to 10 12 are 1093 and 3511. 47 In addition, the following connection exists: Let n be a base 2 pseudoprime and p be a prime divisor of n . If       2   n  -  1    -  1   n   ≢   0     (   mod  p   )       not-equivalent-to       superscript  2    n  1    1   n    annotated  0   pmod  p      \tfrac{2^{n-1}-1}{n}\not\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)   , then also       2   p  -  1    -  1   p   ≢   0     (   mod  p   )       not-equivalent-to       superscript  2    p  1    1   p    annotated  0   pmod  p      \tfrac{2^{p-1}-1}{p}\not\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)   . 48 Furthermore if p is a Wieferich prime, then p 2 is a Catalan pseudoprime . 49  Connection with directed graphs  For all primes up to 100000 L ( p n +1 ) = L ( p n ) only for two cases: L ( 1093 2 ) = L ( 1093 ) = 364 and L ( 3511 2 ) = L ( 3511 ) = 1755, where m is the modulus of the doubling diagram and L ( m ) gives the number of vertices in the cycle of 1. The term doubling diagram refers to the directed graph with 0 and the natural numbers less than m as vertices with arrows pointing from each vertex x to vertex 2 x reduced modulo m . 50 It was shown, that for all odd prime numbers either L ( p n +1 ) = p × L ( p n ) or L ( p n +1 ) = L ( p n ). 51  Properties related to number fields  It was shown that      χ   D  0     (  p  )    =  1         subscript  χ   subscript  D  0    p   1    \chi_{D_{0}}\big(p\big)=1   and      λ  p    (   ℚ   (    D  0    )    )    =  1         subscript  λ  p     ℚ     subscript  D  0      1    \lambda\,\!_{p}\big(\mathbb{Q}\big(\sqrt{D_{0}}\big)\big)=1   if and only if 2 p − 1 ≢ 1 (mod p 2 ) where p is an odd prime and     D  0   <  0       subscript  D  0   0    D_{0}<0   is the fundamental discriminant of the imaginary quadratic field     ℚ   (    1  -   p  2     )       ℚ      1   superscript  p  2       \mathbb{Q}\big(\sqrt{1-p^{2}}\big)   . Furthermore the following was shown: Let p be a Wieferich prime. If , let     D  0   <  0       subscript  D  0   0    D_{0}<0   be the fundamental discriminant of the imaginary quadratic field    ℚ   (    1  -  p    )       ℚ      1  p      \mathbb{Q}\big(\sqrt{1-p}\big)   and if , let     D  0   <  0       subscript  D  0   0    D_{0}<0   be the fundamental discriminant of the imaginary quadratic field    ℚ   (    4  -  p    )       ℚ      4  p      \mathbb{Q}\big(\sqrt{4-p}\big)   . Then      χ   D  0     (  p  )    =  1         subscript  χ   subscript  D  0    p   1    \chi_{D_{0}}\big(p\big)=1   and      λ  p    (   ℚ   (    D  0    )    )    =  1         subscript  λ  p     ℚ     subscript  D  0      1    \lambda\,\!_{p}\big(\mathbb{Q}\big(\sqrt{D_{0}}\big)\big)=1   ( χ and λ in this context denote Iwasawa invariants ). 52  Furthermore the following result was obtained: Let q be an odd prime number, k and p are primes such that and the order of q modulo k is     k  -  1   2        k  1   2    \tfrac{k-1}{2}   . Assume that q divides h + , the class number of the real cyclotomic field     ℚ   (    ζ  p   +   ζ  p   -  1     )       ℚ     subscript  ζ  p    superscript   subscript  ζ  p     1       \mathbb{Q}\big(\zeta\,\!_{p}+\zeta\,\!_{p}^{-1}\big)   , the cyclotomic field obtained by adjoining the sum of a p -th root of unity and its reciprocal to the field of rational numbers. Then q is a Wieferich prime. 53 This also holds if the conditions  and are replaced by  and as well as when the condition  is replaced by  (in which case q is a Wall−Sun−Sun prime ) and the incongruence condition replaced by . 54  Generalizations  Near-Wieferich primes  A prime p satisfying the congruence 2 ( p −1)/2 ≡ ±1 + Ap (mod p 2 ) with small | A | is commonly called a near-Wieferich prime . 55 56 Near-Wieferich primes with A = 0 represent Wieferich primes. Recent searches, in addition to their primary search for Wieferich primes, also tried to find near-Wieferich primes. 57 58 The following table lists all near-Wieferich primes with | A | ≤ 10 in the interval [1     ×   10  9       absent   superscript  10  9     \times 10^{9}   , 3     ×    10  1   5       absent     superscript  10  1   5     \times 10^{1}5   ].

Dorais and Klyve 61 used a different definition of a near-Wieferich prime, defining it as a prime p with small value of    |    ω   (  p  )    p   |          ω  p   p     \left|\tfrac{\omega(p)}{p}\right|   where     ω   (  p  )    =       2   p  -  1    -  1   p    mod  p         ω  p    modulo       superscript  2    p  1    1   p   p     \omega(p)=\tfrac{2^{p-1}-1}{p}\,\bmod\,p   is the Fermat quotient of 2 with respect to p modulo p (the modulo operation here gives the residue with the smallest absolute value). The following table lists all primes p ≤ 6.7 × 10 15 with     |    ω   (  p  )    p   |   ≤   10   -  14              ω  p   p     superscript  10    14      \left|\tfrac{\omega(p)}{p}\right|\leq 10^{-14}   .      p       ω   (  p  )       ω  p    \omega(p)           |    ω   (  p  )    p   |   ×   10  14             ω  p   p     superscript  10  14     \left|\tfrac{\omega(p)}{p}\right|\times 10^{14}          1093   0   0     3511   0   0     2276306935816523   +6   0.264     3167939147662997   −17   0.537     3723113065138349   −36   0.967     5131427559624857   −36   0.702     5294488110626977   −31   0.586     6517506365514181   +58   0.890     The two notions of nearness are related as follows. If     2    (   p  -  1   )   /  2    ≡     ±  1   +   A  p       (   mod   p  2    )         superscript  2      p  1   2     annotated     plus-or-minus  1     A  p     pmod   superscript  p  2       2^{(p-1)/2}\equiv\pm 1+Ap\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{2})   , then by squaring, clearly     2   p  -  1    ≡    1  ±   2  A  p       (   mod   p  2    )         superscript  2    p  1     annotated   plus-or-minus  1    2  A  p     pmod   superscript  p  2       2^{p-1}\equiv 1\pm 2Ap\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{2})   . So if   A   A   A   had been chosen with    |  A  |      A    |A|   small, then clearly     |   ±   2  A    |   =   2   |  A  |           plus-or-minus    2  A       2    A      |\pm 2A|=2|A|   is also (quite) small, and an even number. However, when    ω   (  p  )       ω  p    \omega(p)   is odd above, the related   A   A   A   from before the last squaring was not "small". For example with    p  =  3167939147662997      p  3167939147662997    p=3167939147662997   , we have     2    (   p  -  1   )   /  2    ≡     -  1   -   1583969573831490  p       (   mod   p  2    )         superscript  2      p  1   2     annotated      1     1583969573831490  p     pmod   superscript  p  2       2^{(p-1)/2}\equiv-1-1583969573831490p\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{2})   which reads extremely non-near, but after squaring this is     2   p  -  1    ≡    1  -   17  p       (   mod   p  2    )         superscript  2    p  1     annotated    1    17  p     pmod   superscript  p  2       2^{p-1}\equiv 1-17p\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{2})   which is a near-Wieferich by the second definition.  Base- a Wieferich primes  A Wieferich prime base a is a prime p that satisfies   a p − 1 ≡ 1 (mod p 2 ). 62    Such a prime cannot divide a , since then it would also divide 1.  It is conjectured that there are infinitely many Wieferich primes in every base a .  Bolyai showed that if p and q are primes, a is a positive integer not divisible by p and q such that , , then . Setting p = q leads to . 63 It was shown that if and only if . 64  Known solutions of for small values of a are: 65        a   p (checked up to 5 × 10 13 )   OEIS sequence       1   2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ...

There are only 7 known Wieferich pairs. 71   (2, 1093), (3, 1006003), (5, 1645333507), (5, 188748146801), (83, 4871), (911, 318917), and (2903, 18787) (sequences ,  and  in OEIS )   Wieferich sequence  Start with a(1) any natural number (>1), a( n ) = the smallest prime p such that (a( n - 1)) p - 1 = 1 (mod p 2 ) but p 2 does not divide a( n - 1) - 1 or a( n - 1) + 1. (If p 2 divides a( n - 1) - 1 or a( n - 1) + 1, then the solution is a trivial solution ) It is a conjecture that every natural number k = a(1) > 1 makes this sequence become periodic, for example, let a(1) = 2:   2, 1093, 5, 20771, 18043, 5, 20771, 18043, 5, ..., it gets a cycle: {5, 20771, 18043}.   Let a(1) = 83:   83, 4871, 83, 4871, 83, 4871, 83, ..., it gets a cycle: {83, 4871}.   Let a(1) = 59 (a longer sequence):   59, 2777, 133287067, 13, 863, 7, 5, 20771, 18043, 5, ..., it also gets 5.   However, there are many values of a(1) with unknown status, for example, let a(1) = 3:   3, 11, 71, 47, ? (There are no known Wieferich primes in base 47).   Let a(1) = 14:   14, 29, ? (There are no known Wieferich prime in base 29 except 2, but 2 2 = 4 divides 29 - 1 = 28)   Let a(1) = 39 (a longer sequence):   39, 8039, 617, 101, 1050139, 29, ? (It also gets 29)   It is unknown that values for a(1) > 1 exist such that the resulting sequence does not eventually become periodic.  When a( n - 1)= k , a( n ) will be (start with k = 2): 1093, 11, 1093, 20771, 66161, 5, 1093, 11, 487, 71, 2693, 863, 29, 29131, 1093, 46021, 5, 7, 281, ?, 13, 13, 25633, 20771, 71, 11, 19, ?, 7, 7, 5, 233, 46145917691, 1613, 66161, 77867, 17, 8039, 11, 29, 23, 5, 229, 1283, 829, ?, 257, 491531, ?, ... (For k = 21, 29, 47, 50, even the next value is unknown)  Wieferich numbers  A Wieferich number is an odd integer w ≥ 3 satisfying the congruence 2 φ ( w ) ≡ 1 (mod w 2 ), where φ (·) denotes the Euler function . If Wieferich number w is prime, then it is a Wieferich prime. The first few Wieferich numbers are:   1093, 3279, 3511, 7651, 10533, 14209, 17555, 22953, 31599, 42627, 45643, 52665, 68859, 94797, 99463, …   It can be shown that if there are only finitely many Wieferich primes, then there are only finitely many Wieferich numbers. In particular, if the only Wieferich primes are 1093 and 3511, then there exist exactly 104 Wieferich numbers, which matches the number of Wieferich numbers currently known. 72  More generally, an integer w is a Wieferich number to base  a , if a φ ( w ) ≡ 1 (mod w 2 ). 73  Another definition specifies a Wieferich number as positive odd integer q such that q and      2  m   -  1   q         superscript  2  m   1   q    \tfrac{2^{m}-1}{q}   are not coprime , where m is the multiplicative order of 2 modulo q . The first of these numbers are: 74   21, 39, 55, 57, 105, 111, 147, 155, 165, 171, 183, 195, 201, 203, 205, 219, 231, 237, 253, 273, 285, 291, 301, 305, 309, 327, 333, 355, 357, 385, 399, …   As above, if Wieferich number q is prime, then it is a Wieferich prime.  Lucas-Wieferich primes  A Lucas-Wieferich prime associated with the pair of integers (P, Q) is a prime p such that U p-ε (P, Q) ≡ 0 (mod p 2 ), where U n (P, Q) denotes the Lucas sequence  of the first kind and ε equals the Legendre symbol of P 2 - 4 Q modulo p . All Wieferich primes are Lucas-Wieferich primes associated with the pair (3, 2). 75  Fibonacci-Wieferich primes  Let Q = -1, P be any natural number, these primes are called P -Fibonacci-Wieferich primes or P - Wall-Sun-Sun primes , and if P = 1, they are called Fibonacci-Wieferich primes , and if P = 2, they are called Pell-Wieferich primes . For example, 241 is a Wieferich prime when P = 3, so it is a 3-Fibonacci-Wieferich prime or 3-Wall-Sun-Sun prime. In fact, 3 is an n -Fibonacci-Wieferich prime if and only if n congruent to 0, 4, or 5 (mod 9), like the traditional Wieferich primes, 3 is a base n Wieferich prime if and only if n congruent to 1 or 8 (mod 9).  Wieferich places  Let K be a global field , i.e. a number field or a function field in one variable over a finite field and let E be an elliptic curve . If v is a non-archimedean place of norm  q v of K and a ∈ K, with v ( a ) = 0 then v (a q v -1 -1) ≥ 1. v is called a Wieferich place for base a , if v (a q v -1 -1) > 1, an elliptic Wieferich place for base P ∈ E , if N v P ∈ E 2 and a strong elliptic Wieferich place for base P ∈ E if n v P ∈ E 2 , where n v is the order of P modulo v and N v gives the number of rational points (over the residue field of v ) of the reduction of E at v . 76  See also   Wall-Sun-Sun prime – another type of prime number which in the broadest sense also resulted from the study of FLT  Wolstenholme prime – another type of prime number which in the broadest sense also resulted from the study of FLT  Wilson prime  Table of congruences - lists other congruences satisfied by prime numbers  PrimeGrid - primes search project  BOINC  Distributed computing   References  Further reading          External links    Fermat-/Euler-quotients ( a p −1 − 1)/ p k with arbitrary k  A note on the two known Wieferich primes  PrimeGrid's [ http://www.primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=3008&nowrap; ;=true#45945 Wieferich Prime Search project] page   "  Category:Classes of prime numbers  Category:Unsolved problems in mathematics     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩  PrimeGrid Announcement of Wieferich and Wall-Sun-Sun searches ↩  PrimeGrid Wieferich prime search server statistics ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩     Charles, D.
