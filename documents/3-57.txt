Wieferich prime

In number theory, a Wieferich prime is a prime number p such that p2 divides 2p − 1 − 1,1 therefore connecting these primes with Fermat's little theorem, which states that every odd prime p divides 2p − 1 − 1. Wieferich primes were first described by Arthur Wieferich in 1909 in works pertaining to Fermat's last theorem, at which time both of Fermat's theorems were already well known to mathematicians.23
Since then, connections between Wieferich primes and various other topics in mathematics have been discovered, including other types of numbers and primes, such as Mersenne and Fermat numbers, specific types of pseudoprimes and some types of numbers generalized from the original definition of a Wieferich prime. Over time, those connections discovered have extended to cover more properties of certain prime numbers as well as more general subjects such as number fields and the abc conjecture.
, the only known Wieferich primes are 1093 and 3511 .
Equivalent definitions
The stronger version of Fermat's little theorem, which a Wieferich prime satisfies, is usually expressed as a congruence relation . From the definition of the congruence relation on integers, it follows that this property is equivalent to the definition given at the beginning. Thus if a prime p satisfies this congruence, this prime divides the Fermat quotient

 
 . The following are two illustrative examples using the primes 11 and 1093:

For p = 11, we get 
 
 
 
  which is 93 and leaves a remainder of 5 after division by 11, hence 11 is not a Wieferich prime. For p = 1093, we get 
 
 
 
  or 485439490310...852893958515 (302 intermediate digits omitted for clarity), which leaves a remainder of 0 after division by 1093 and thus 1093 is a Wieferich prime.
 

Wieferich primes can be defined by other equivalent congruences. If p is a Wieferich prime, one can multiply both sides of the congruence 2p-1 ≡ 1 (mod p2) by 2 to get 2p ≡ 2 (mod p2). Raising both sides of the congruence to the power p shows that a Wieferich prime also satisfies 2p2 ≡2p ≡ 2 (mod p2), and hence 2pk ≡ 2 (mod p2) for all k ≥ 1. The converse is also true: 2pk ≡ 2 (mod p2) for some k ≥ 1 implies that the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p2 divides gcd(pk-1,φ(p2))=p-1, that is, 2p-1 ≡ 1 (mod p2) and thus p is a Wieferich prime. This also implies that Wieferich primes can be defined as primes p such that the multiplicative orders of 2 modulo p and modulo p2 coincide: , (By the way, ord10932 = 364, and ord35112 = 1755).

History and search status
In 1902, W. F. Meyer proved a theorem about solutions of the congruence ap − 1 ≡ 1 (mod pr).5 Later in that decade Arthur Wieferich showed specifically that if the first case of Fermat's last theorem has solutions for an odd prime exponent, then that prime must satisfy that congruence for a = 2 and r = 2. In other words, if there exist solutions to xp + yp + zp = 0 in integers x, y, z and p an odd prime with p ∤ xyz, then p satisfies 2p − 1 ≡ 1 (mod p2). In 1913, Bachmann examined the residues of 
 
 
 
 . He asked the question when this residue vanishes and tried to find expressions for answering this question.6
The prime 1093 was found to be a Wieferich prime by Waldemar Meissner in 1913 and confirmed to be the only such prime below 2000. He calculated the smallest residue of 
 
 
 
  for all primes p  E. Haentzschel later ordered verification of the correctness of Meissners congruence via only elementary calculations.7 Inspired by an earlier work of Euler, he simplified Meissners proof by showing that 10932 | (2182 + 1) and remarked that (2182 + 1) is a factor of (2364 − 1).8 It was also shown that it is possible to prove that 1093 is a Wieferich prime without using complex numbers contrary to the method used by Meissner,9 although Meissner himself hinted at that he was aware of a proof without complex values.10
The prime 3511 was first found to be a Wieferich prime by N. G. W. H. Beeger in 192211 and another proof of it being a Wieferich prime was published in 1965 by Guy.12 In 1960, Kravitz13 doubled a previous record set by Fröberg14 and in 1961 Riesel extended the search to 500000 with the aid of BESK.15 Around 1980, Lehmer was able to reach the search limit of 6
 
 
 
 .16 This limit was extended to over 2.5
 
 
 
  in 2006,17 finally reaching 3
 
 
 
 . It is now known, that if any other Wieferich primes exist, they must be greater than 6.7
 
 
 
 .18 The search for new Wieferich primes is currently performed by the distributed computing project Wieferich@Home. In December 2011, another search was started by the PrimeGrid project.19 , PrimeGrid has extended the search limit to over 3
 
 
 
  and continues.20
It has been conjectured (as for Wilson primes) that infinitely many Wieferich primes exist, and that the number of Wieferich primes below x is approximately log(log(x)), which is a heuristic result that follows from the plausible assumption that for a prime p, the (p − 1)-th degree roots of unity modulo p2 are uniformly distributed in the multiplicative group of integers modulo p2.21
Properties
Connection with Fermat's last theorem
The following theorem connecting Wieferich primes and Fermat's last theorem was proven by Wieferich in 1909:22

Let p be prime, and let x, y, z be integers such that xp + yp + zp = 0. Furthermore, assume that p does not divide the product xyz. Then p is a Wieferich prime.
 

The above case (where p does not divide any of x, y or z) is commonly known as the first case of Fermat's last theorem (FLTI)2324 and FLTI is said to fail for a prime p, if solutions to the Fermat equation exist for that p, otherwise FLTI holds for p.25 In 1910, Mirimanoff expanded26 the theorem by showing that, if the preconditions of the theorem hold true for some prime p, then p2 must also divide 3p − 1 − 1. Granville and Monagan further proved that p2 must actually divide mp − 1 − 1 for every prime m ≤ 89.27 Suzuki extended the proof to all primes m ≤ 113.28
Let Hp be a set of pairs of integers with 1 as their greatest common divisor, p being prime to x, y and x + y, (x + y)p-1 ≡ 1 (mod p2), (x + ξy) being the pth power of an ideal of K with ξ defined as cos 2π/p + i sin 2π/p. K = Q(ξ) is the field extension obtained by adjoining all polynomials in the algebraic number ξ to the field of rational numbers (such an extension is known as a number field or in this particular case, where ξ is a root of unity, a cyclotomic number field).29 From uniqueness of factorization of ideals in Q(ξ) it follows that if the first case of Fermat's last theorem has solutions x, y, z then p divides x+y+z and (x, y), (y, z) and (z, x) are elements of Hp.30 Granville and Monagan showed that (1, 1) ∈ Hp if and only if p is a Wieferich prime.31
Connection with the abc conjecture and non-Wieferich primes
A non-Wieferich prime is a prime p satisfying 2p − 1 ≢ 1 (mod p2). J. H. Silverman showed in 1988 that if the abc conjecture holds, then there exist infinitely many non-Wieferich primes.32 More precisely he showed that the abc conjecture implies the existence of a constant only depending on α such that the number of non-Wieferich primes to base α with p less than or equal to a variable X is greater than log(X) as X goes to infinity.33 Numerical evidence suggests that very few of the prime numbers in a given interval are Wieferich primes. The set of Wieferich primes and the set of non-Wieferich primes, sometimes denoted by W2 and W2c respectively,34 are complementary sets, so if one of them is shown to be finite, the other one would necessarily have to be infinite, because both are proper subsets of the set of prime numbers. It was later shown that the existence of infinitely many non-Wieferich primes already follows from a weaker version of the abc conjecture, called the ABC-(k, ε) conjecture.35 Additionally, the existence of infinitely many non-Wieferich primes would also follow if there exist infinitely many square-free Mersenne numbers36 as well as if there exists a real number ξ such that the set {n ∈ N : λ(2n − 1) \tfrac{\log n}{\log \gamma (n)} and 
 
 
 
 , meaning 
 
 
 
  gives the product of all prime factors of n.37
Connection with Mersenne and Fermat primes
It is known that the nth Mersenne number Mn = 2n − 1 is prime only if n is prime. Fermat's little theorem implies that if p > 2 is prime, then Mp−1 (= 2p − 1 − 1) is always divisible by p. Since Mersenne numbers of prime indices Mp and Mq are co-prime,


A prime divisor p of Mq, where q is prime, is a Wieferich prime if and only if p2 divides Mq.38




Thus, a Mersenne prime cannot also be a Wieferich prime. A notable open problem is to determine whether or not all Mersenne numbers of prime index are square-free. If q is prime and the Mersenne number Mq is not square-free, that is, there exists a prime p for which p2 divides Mq, then p is a Wieferich prime. Therefore, if there are only finitely many Wieferich primes, then there will be at most finitely many Mersenne numbers with prime index that are not square-free. Rotkiewicz showed a related result: if there are infinitely many square-free Mersenne numbers, then there are infinitely many non-Wieferich primes.39
Similarly, if p is prime and p2 divides some Fermat number Fn = 22n + 1, then p must be a Wieferich prime.40
In fact, if and only if there exists a natural number n and a prime p that p2 divides 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
  is Cyclotomic polynomial), then p is a Wieferich prime. For example, 10932 divides 
 
 
 
 , 35112 divides 
 
 
 
 . Mersenne and Fermat numbers are just special situations of 
 
 
 
 . Thus, if 1093 and 3511 are only two Wieferich primes, then all 
 
 
 
  are square-free except 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (In fact, when there exists a prime p which p2 divides some 
 
 
 
 , then it is a Wieferich prime); and clearly, if 
 
 
 
  is a prime, then it cannot be Wieferich prime. (Notice any odd prime p divides only one 
 
 
 
  and n divides p-1, and if and only if the period length of 1/p in binary is n, then p divides 
 
 
 
 . Besides, if and only if p is a Wieferich prime, then the period length of 1/p and 1/p2 are the same (in binary). Otherwise, this is p times than that.)
For the primes 1093 and 3511, it was shown that neither of them is a divisor of any Mersenne number with prime index nor a divisor of any Fermat number, because 364 and 1755 are neither prime nor powers of 2.41
Connection with other equations
Scott and Styer showed that the equation px – 2y = d has at most one solution in positive integers (x, y), unless when p4 | 2ordp 2 – 1 if p ≢ 65 (mod 192) or unconditionally when p2 | 2ordp 2 – 1, where ordp 2 denotes the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p.42 They also showed that a solution to the equation ±ax1 ± 2y1 = ±ax2 ± 2y2 = c must be from a specific set of equations but that this does not hold, if a is a Wieferich prime greater than 1.25 x 1015.43
Binary periodicity of p−1
Johnson observed44 that the two known Wieferich primes are one greater than numbers with periodic binary expansions (1092 = 0100010001002=44416; 3510 = 1101101101102=66668). The Wieferich@Home project searches for Wieferich primes by testing numbers that are one greater than a number with a periodic binary expansion, but up to a "bit pseudo-length" of 3500 of the tested binary numbers generated by combination of bit strings with a bit length of up to 24 it has not found a new Wieferich prime.45
Abundancy of p−1
It has been noted  that the known Wieferich primes are one greater than mutually friendly numbers (the shared abundancy index being 112/39).
Connection with pseudoprimes
It was observed that the two known Wieferich primes are the square factors of all non-square free base-2 Fermat pseudoprimes up to 25
 
 
 
 .46 Later computations showed that the only repeated factors of the pseudoprimes up to 1012 are 1093 and 3511.47 In addition, the following connection exists: Let n be a base 2 pseudoprime and p be a prime divisor of n. If 
 
 
 
 , then also 
 
 
 
 .48 Furthermore if p is a Wieferich prime, then p2 is a Catalan pseudoprime.49
Connection with directed graphs
For all primes up to 100000 L(pn+1) = L(pn) only for two cases: L(10932) = L(1093) = 364 and L(35112) = L(3511) = 1755, where m is the modulus of the doubling diagram and L(m) gives the number of vertices in the cycle of 1. The term doubling diagram refers to the directed graph with 0 and the natural numbers less than m as vertices with arrows pointing from each vertex x to vertex 2x reduced modulo m.50 It was shown, that for all odd prime numbers either L(pn+1) = p × L(pn) or L(pn+1) = L(pn).51
Properties related to number fields
It was shown that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  if and only if 2p − 1 ≢ 1 (mod p2) where p is an odd prime and 
 
 
 
  is the fundamental discriminant of the imaginary quadratic field

 
 . Furthermore the following was shown: Let p be a Wieferich prime. If , let 
 
 
 
  be the fundamental discriminant of the imaginary quadratic field 
 
 
 
  and if , let 
 
 
 
  be the fundamental discriminant of the imaginary quadratic field 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (χ and λ in this context denote Iwasawa invariants).52
Furthermore the following result was obtained: Let q be an odd prime number, k and p are primes such that     and the order of q modulo k is 
 
 
 
 . Assume that q divides h+, the class number of the real cyclotomic field

 
 , the cyclotomic field obtained by adjoining the sum of a p-th root of unity and its reciprocal to the field of rational numbers. Then q is a Wieferich prime.53 This also holds if the conditions  and  are replaced by  and  as well as when the condition  is replaced by  (in which case q is a Wall−Sun−Sun prime) and the incongruence condition replaced by .54
Generalizations
Near-Wieferich primes
A prime p satisfying the congruence 2(p−1)/2 ≡ ±1 + Ap (mod p2) with small |A| is commonly called a near-Wieferich prime .5556 Near-Wieferich primes with A = 0 represent Wieferich primes. Recent searches, in addition to their primary search for Wieferich primes, also tried to find near-Wieferich primes.5758 The following table lists all near-Wieferich primes with |A| ≤ 10 in the interval [1

Base-a Wieferich primes
A Wieferich prime base a is a prime p that satisfies

ap − 1 ≡ 1 (mod p2).62


Such a prime cannot divide a, since then it would also divide 1.
It is conjectured that there are infinitely many Wieferich primes in every base a.
Bolyai showed that if p and q are primes, a is a positive integer not divisible by p and q such that , , then . Setting p = q leads to .63 It was shown that  if and only if .64

Wieferich pairs
A Wieferich pair is a pair of primes p and q that satisfy

pq − 1 ≡ 1 (mod q2) and qp − 1 ≡ 1 (mod p2)
 

so that a Wieferich prime p ≡ 1 (mod 4) will form such a pair (p, 2): the only known instance in this case is p = 1093. There are only 7 known Wieferich pairs.71

(2, 1093), (3, 1006003), (5, 1645333507), (5, 188748146801), (83, 4871), (911, 318917), and (2903, 18787) (sequences ,  and  in OEIS)
 

Wieferich sequence
Start with a(1) any natural number (>1), a(n) = the smallest prime p such that (a(n - 1))p - 1 = 1 (mod p2) but p2 does not divide a(n - 1) - 1 or a(n - 1) + 1. (If p2 divides a(n - 1) - 1 or a(n - 1) + 1, then the solution is a trivial solution) It is a conjecture that every natural number k = a(1) > 1 makes this sequence become periodic, for example, let a(1) = 2:

2, 1093, 5, 20771, 18043, 5, 20771, 18043, 5, ..., it gets a cycle: {5, 20771, 18043}.
 

Let a(1) = 83:

83, 4871, 83, 4871, 83, 4871, 83, ..., it gets a cycle: {83, 4871}.
 

Let a(1) = 59 (a longer sequence):

59, 2777, 133287067, 13, 863, 7, 5, 20771, 18043, 5, ..., it also gets 5.
 

However, there are many values of a(1) with unknown status, for example, let a(1) = 3:

3, 11, 71, 47, ? (There are no known Wieferich primes in base 47).
 

Let a(1) = 14:

14, 29, ? (There are no known Wieferich prime in base 29 except 2, but 22 = 4 divides 29 - 1 = 28)
 

Let a(1) = 39 (a longer sequence):

39, 8039, 617, 101, 1050139, 29, ? (It also gets 29)
 

It is unknown that values for a(1) > 1 exist such that the resulting sequence does not eventually become periodic.
When a(n - 1)=k, a(n) will be (start with k = 2): 1093, 11, 1093, 20771, 66161, 5, 1093, 11, 487, 71, 2693, 863, 29, 29131, 1093, 46021, 5, 7, 281, ?, 13, 13, 25633, 20771, 71, 11, 19, ?, 7, 7, 5, 233, 46145917691, 1613, 66161, 77867, 17, 8039, 11, 29, 23, 5, 229, 1283, 829, ?, 257, 491531, ?, ... (For k = 21, 29, 47, 50, even the next value is unknown)
Wieferich numbers
A Wieferich number is an odd integer w ≥ 3 satisfying the congruence 2φ(w) ≡ 1 (mod w2), where φ(·) denotes the Euler function. If Wieferich number w is prime, then it is a Wieferich prime. The first few Wieferich numbers are:

1093, 3279, 3511, 7651, 10533, 14209, 17555, 22953, 31599, 42627, 45643, 52665, 68859, 94797, 99463, … 
 

It can be shown that if there are only finitely many Wieferich primes, then there are only finitely many Wieferich numbers. In particular, if the only Wieferich primes are 1093 and 3511, then there exist exactly 104 Wieferich numbers, which matches the number of Wieferich numbers currently known.72
More generally, an integer w is a Wieferich number to base a, if aφ(w) ≡ 1 (mod w2).73
Another definition specifies a Wieferich number as positive odd integer q such that q and 
 
 
 
  are not coprime, where m is the multiplicative order of 2 modulo q. The first of these numbers are:74

21, 39, 55, 57, 105, 111, 147, 155, 165, 171, 183, 195, 201, 203, 205, 219, 231, 237, 253, 273, 285, 291, 301, 305, 309, 327, 333, 355, 357, 385, 399, … 
 

As above, if Wieferich number q is prime, then it is a Wieferich prime.
Lucas-Wieferich primes
A Lucas-Wieferich prime associated with the pair of integers (P, Q) is a prime p such that Up-ε(P, Q) ≡ 0 (mod p2), where Un(P, Q) denotes the Lucas sequence of the first kind and ε equals the Legendre symbol of P2 - 4Q modulo p. All Wieferich primes are Lucas-Wieferich primes associated with the pair (3, 2).75
Fibonacci-Wieferich primes
Let Q = -1, P be any natural number, these primes are called P-Fibonacci-Wieferich primes or P-Wall-Sun-Sun primes, and if P = 1, they are called Fibonacci-Wieferich primes, and if P = 2, they are called Pell-Wieferich primes. For example, 241 is a Wieferich prime when P = 3, so it is a 3-Fibonacci-Wieferich prime or 3-Wall-Sun-Sun prime. In fact, 3 is an n-Fibonacci-Wieferich prime if and only if n congruent to 0, 4, or 5 (mod 9), like the traditional Wieferich primes, 3 is a base n Wieferich prime if and only if n congruent to 1 or 8 (mod 9).
Wieferich places
Let K be a global field, i.e. a number field or a function field in one variable over a finite field and let E be an elliptic curve. If v is a non-archimedean place of norm qv of K and a ∈ K, with v(a) = 0 then v(aqv-1-1) ≥ 1. v is called a Wieferich place for base a, if v(aqv-1-1) > 1, an elliptic Wieferich place for base P ∈ E, if NvP ∈ E2 and a strong elliptic Wieferich place for base P ∈ E if nvP ∈ E2, where nv is the order of P modulo v and Nv gives the number of rational points (over the residue field of v) of the reduction of E at v.76
