   Proj construction      Proj construction   In algebraic geometry , Proj is a construction analogous to the spectrum-of-a-ring construction of affine schemes , which produces objects with the typical properties of projective spaces and projective varieties . It is a fundamental tool in scheme theory .  In this article, all rings will be assumed to be commutative and with identity.  Proj of a graded ring  Proj as a set  Let   S   S   S   be a graded ring , where      S  =    ‚äï   i  ‚â•  0     S  i        S    subscript  direct-sum    i  0     subscript  S  i      S=\bigoplus_{i\geq 0}S_{i}   is the direct sum decomposition associated with the gradation.  Define the set Proj S to be the set of all homogeneous prime ideals that do not contain the irrelevant ideal        S  +   =    ‚äï   i  >  0     S  i     .       subscript  S      subscript  direct-sum    i  0     subscript  S  i      S_{+}=\bigoplus_{i>0}S_{i}.     For brevity we will sometimes write X for Proj S .  Proj as a topological space  We may define a topology , called the Zariski topology , on Proj S by defining the closed sets to be those of the form        V   (  a  )    =   {   p  ‚àà   Proj  S    ‚à£   a  ‚äÜ  p   }    ,        V  a    conditional-set    p   Proj  S      a  p      V(a)=\{p\in\operatorname{Proj}\,S\mid a\subseteq p\},     where a is a homogeneous ideal of S . As in the case of affine schemes it is quickly verified that the V ( a ) form the closed sets of a topology on X .  Indeed, if     (   a  i   )    i  ‚àà  I      subscript   subscript  a  i     i  I     (a_{i})_{i\in I}   are a family of ideals, then we have     ‚ãÇ   V   (   a  i   )     =   V   (   Œ£   a  i    )            V   subscript  a  i       V    normal-Œ£   subscript  a  i       \bigcap V(a_{i})=V(\Sigma a_{i})   and if the indexing set I is finite, then     ‚ãÉ   V   (   a  i   )     =   V   (   Œ†   a  i    )            V   subscript  a  i       V    normal-Œ†   subscript  a  i       \bigcup V(a_{i})=V(\Pi a_{i})   .  Equivalently, we may take the open sets as a starting point and define        D   (  a  )    =   {   p  ‚àà   Proj  S    ‚à£    a   ‚äà  p   }    .        D  a    conditional-set    p   Proj  S     not-subset-of-or-equals  a  p      D(a)=\{p\in\operatorname{Proj}\,S\mid a\;\not\subseteq\;p\}.     A common shorthand is to denote D ( Sf ) by D ( f ), where Sf is the ideal generated by f . For any a , D ( a ) and V ( a ) are obviously complementary and hence the same proof as before shows that the D ( a ) are a topology on Proj S . The advantage of this approach is that the D ( f ), where f ranges over all homogeneous elements of S , form a base for this topology, which is an indispensable tool for the analysis of Proj S just as the analogous fact for the spectrum of a ring is likewise indispensable.  Proj as a scheme  We also construct a sheaf on Proj S , called the ‚Äústructure sheaf‚Äù as in the affine case, which makes it into a scheme . As in the case of the Spec construction there are many ways to proceed: the most direct one, which is also highly suggestive of the construction of regular functions on a projective variety in classical algebraic geometry, is the following. For any open set U of Proj S (which is by definition a set of homogeneous prime ideals of S not containing    S  +     subscript  S     S_{+}   ) we define the ring     O  X    (  U  )        subscript  O  X   U    O_{X}(U)   to be the set of all functions      f  :   U  ‚Üí    ‚ãÉ   p  ‚àà  U     S   (  p  )         normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  U    subscript     p  U     subscript  S  p       f\colon U\to\bigcup_{p\in U}S_{(p)}     (where    S   (  p  )      subscript  S  p    S_{(p)}   denotes the subring of the ring of fractions    S  p     subscript  S  p    S_{p}   consisting of fractions of homogeneous elements of the same degree) such that for each prime ideal p of U :   f(p) is an element of    S   (  p  )      subscript  S  p    S_{(p)}   ;  There exists an open subset V of U containing p and homogeneous elements s , t of S of the same degree such that for each prime ideal q of V :  t is not in q ;  f(q) = s/t .    It follows immediately from the definition that the     O  X    (  U  )        subscript  O  X   U    O_{X}(U)   form a sheaf of rings    O  X     subscript  O  X    O_{X}   on Proj S , and it may be shown that the pair (Proj S ,    O  X     subscript  O  X    O_{X}   ) is in fact a scheme (this is accomplished by showing that each of the open subsets D(f) is in fact an affine scheme).  The sheaf associated to a graded module  The essential property of S for the above construction was the ability to form localizations    S   (  p  )      subscript  S  p    S_{(p)}   for each prime ideal p of S . This property is also possessed by any graded module  M over S , and therefore with the appropriate minor modifications the preceding section constructs for any such M a sheaf, denoted    M  ~     normal-~  M    \tilde{M}   , of graded    O  X     subscript  O  X    O_{X}   -modules on Proj S .  The twisting sheaf of Serre   For related information, and the classical Serre twist sheaf, see tautological bundle    A special case of the sheaf associated to a graded module is when we take M to be S itself with a different grading: namely, we let the degree- d elements of M be the degree-( d + 1) elements of S , and denote M = S (1). We then obtain    M  ~     normal-~  M    \tilde{M}   as a sheaf of graded    O  X     subscript  O  X    O_{X}   -modules on Proj S , denoted     O  X    (  1  )        subscript  O  X   1    O_{X}(1)   or simply O (1), called the twisting sheaf of Serre (named after Jean-Pierre Serre ). It can be checked that O (1) is in fact an invertible sheaf .  One reason for the utility of O (1) is that it recovers the algebraic information of S that was lost when, in the construction of    O  X     subscript  O  X    O_{X}   , we passed to fractions of degree zero. In the case Spec A for a ring A , the global sections of the structure sheaf form A itself, whereas the global sections of    O  X     subscript  O  X    O_{X}   here form only the degree-zero elements of S . If we define       O   (  n  )    =    ‚äó   i  =  1   n    O   (  1  )           O  n     superscript   subscript  tensor-product    i  1    n     O  1      O(n)=\bigotimes_{i=1}^{n}O(1)     then each O ( n ) contains the degree- n information about S , and taken together they contain all the grading information that was lost. Likewise, for any sheaf of graded    O  X     subscript  O  X    O_{X}   -modules N we define       N   (  n  )    =    N  ‚äó  O    (  n  )          N  n      tensor-product  N  O   n     N(n)=N\otimes O(n)     and expect this ‚Äútwisted‚Äù sheaf to contain grading information about N . In particular, if N is the sheaf associated to a graded S -module M we likewise expect it to contain lost grading information about M . This suggests, though erroneously, that S can in fact be reconstructed from these sheaves; however, this is true in the case that S is a polynomial ring, below. This situation is to be contrasted with the fact that the spec functor is adjoint to the global sections functor in the category of locally ringed spaces .  Projective n -space  If A is a ring, we define projective n -space over A to be the scheme        ‚Ñô  A  n   =    Proj  A    [   x  0   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  n   ]     .       subscript   superscript  ‚Ñô  n   A      Proj  A     subscript  x  0   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  n       \mathbb{P}^{n}_{A}=\operatorname{Proj}\,A[x_{0},\ldots,x_{n}].     The grading on the polynomial ring    S  =   A   [   x  0   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  n   ]        S    A    subscript  x  0   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  n       S=A[x_{0},\ldots,x_{n}]   is defined by letting each    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   have degree one and every element of A , degree zero. Comparing this to the definition of O (1), above, we see that the sections of O (1) are in fact linear homogeneous polynomials, generated by the    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   themselves. This suggests another interpretation of O (1), namely as the sheaf of ‚Äúcoordinates‚Äù for Proj S , since the    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   are literally the coordinates for projective n -space.  Global Proj  A generalization of the Proj construction replaces the ring S with a sheaf of algebras and produces, as the end result, a scheme which might be thought of as a fibration of Proj's of rings. This construction is often used, for example, to construct projective space bundles over a base scheme .  Assumptions  Formally, let X be any scheme and S be a sheaf of graded    O  X     subscript  O  X    O_{X}   -algebras (the definition of which is similar to the definition of     O  X     subscript  O  X    O_{X}   -modules on a locally ringed space ): that is, a sheaf with a direct sum decomposition      S  =    ‚äï   i  ‚â•  0     S  i        S    subscript  direct-sum    i  0     subscript  S  i      S=\bigoplus_{i\geq 0}S_{i}     where each    S  i     subscript  S  i    S_{i}   is an    O  X     subscript  O  X    O_{X}   -module such that for every open subset U of X , S ( U ) is an     O  X    (  U  )        subscript  O  X   U    O_{X}(U)   -algebra and the resulting direct sum decomposition       S   (  U  )    =    ‚äï   i  ‚â•  0      S  i    (  U  )           S  U     subscript  direct-sum    i  0       subscript  S  i   U      S(U)=\bigoplus_{i\geq 0}S_{i}(U)     is a grading of this algebra as a ring. Here we assume that     S  0   =   O  X        subscript  S  0    subscript  O  X     S_{0}=O_{X}   . We make the additional assumption that S is a quasi-coherent sheaf ; this is a ‚Äúconsistency‚Äù assumption on the sections over different open sets that is necessary for the construction to proceed.  Construction  In this setup we may construct a scheme Proj  S and a ‚Äúprojection‚Äù map p onto X such that for every open affine  U of X ,          (   ùêèùê´ùê®ùê£  S   )   |     p   -  1     (  U  )     =   Proj   (   S   (  U  )    )     .       evaluated-at   ùêèùê´ùê®ùê£  S      superscript  p    1    U     Proj    S  U      (\operatorname{\mathbf{Proj}}\,S)|_{p^{-1}(U)}=\operatorname{Proj}(S(U)).     This definition suggests that we construct Proj  S by first defining schemes    Y  U     subscript  Y  U    Y_{U}   for each open affine U , by setting        Y  U   =    Proj  S    (  U  )     ,       subscript  Y  U      Proj  S   U     Y_{U}=\operatorname{Proj}\,S(U),     and maps     p  U   :    Y  U   ‚Üí  U      normal-:   subscript  p  U    normal-‚Üí   subscript  Y  U   U     p_{U}\colon Y_{U}\to U   , and then showing that these data can be glued together ‚Äúover‚Äù each intersection of two open affines U and V to form a scheme Y which we define to be Proj  S . It is not hard to show that defining each    p  U     subscript  p  U    p_{U}   to be the map corresponding to the inclusion of     O  X    (  U  )        subscript  O  X   U    O_{X}(U)   into S ( U ) as the elements of degree zero yields the necessary consistency of the    p  U     subscript  p  U    p_{U}   , while the consistency of the    Y  U     subscript  Y  U    Y_{U}   themselves follows from the quasi-coherence assumption on S .  The twisting sheaf  If S has the additional property that    S  1     subscript  S  1    S_{1}   is a coherent sheaf and locally generates S over    S  0     subscript  S  0    S_{0}   (that is, when we pass to the stalk of the sheaf S at a point x of X , which is a graded algebra whose degree-zero elements form the ring    O   X  ,  x      subscript  O   X  x     O_{X,x}   then the degree-one elements form a finitely-generated module over    O   X  ,  x      subscript  O   X  x     O_{X,x}   and also generate the stalk as an algebra over it) then we may make a further construction. Over each open affine U , Proj S ( U ) bears an invertible sheaf  O(1) , and the assumption we have just made ensures that these sheaves may be glued just like the    Y  U     subscript  Y  U    Y_{U}   above; the resulting sheaf on Proj  S is also denoted O (1) and serves much the same purpose for Proj  S as the twisting sheaf on the Proj of a ring does.  Proj of a quasi-coherent sheaf  Let   ‚Ñ∞   ‚Ñ∞   \mathcal{E}   be a quasi-coherent sheaf on a scheme   X   X   X   . The sheaf of symmetric algebras     ùêíùê≤ùê¶   O  X     (  ‚Ñ∞  )        subscript  ùêíùê≤ùê¶   subscript  O  X    ‚Ñ∞    \mathbf{Sym}_{O_{X}}(\mathcal{E})   is naturally a quasi-coherent sheaf of graded    O  X     subscript  O  X    O_{X}   -modules, generated by elements of degree 1. The resulting scheme is denoted by    ‚Ñô   (  ‚Ñ∞  )       ‚Ñô  ‚Ñ∞    \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})   . If   ‚Ñ∞   ‚Ñ∞   \mathcal{E}   is of finite type, then its canonical morphism    p  :    ‚Ñô   (  ‚Ñ∞  )    ‚Üí  X      normal-:  p   normal-‚Üí    ‚Ñô  ‚Ñ∞   X     p:\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})\to X   is a projective morphism . 1  For any    x  ‚àà  X      x  X    x\in X   , the fiber of the above morphism over   x   x   x   is the projective space    ‚Ñô   (   ‚Ñ∞   (  x  )    )       ‚Ñô    ‚Ñ∞  x     \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}(x))   associated to the dual of the vector space     ‚Ñ∞   (  x  )    :=    ‚Ñ∞   ‚äó   O  X    k    (  x  )       assign    ‚Ñ∞  x       subscript  tensor-product   subscript  O  X    ‚Ñ∞  k   x     \mathcal{E}(x):=\mathcal{E}\otimes_{O_{X}}k(x)   over    k   (  x  )       k  x    k(x)   .  If   ùíÆ   ùíÆ   \mathcal{S}   is a quasi-coherent sheaf of graded    O  X     subscript  O  X    O_{X}   -modules, generated by    ùíÆ  1     subscript  ùíÆ  1    \mathcal{S}_{1}   and such that    ùíÆ  1     subscript  ùíÆ  1    \mathcal{S}_{1}   is of finite type, then    ùêèùê´ùê®ùê£  ùíÆ      ùêèùê´ùê®ùê£  ùíÆ    \mathbf{Proj}\mathcal{S}   is a closed subscheme of    ‚Ñô   (   ùíÆ  1   )       ‚Ñô   subscript  ùíÆ  1     \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{S}_{1})   and is then projective over   X   X   X   . In fact, every closed subscheme of a projective    ‚Ñô   (  ‚Ñ∞  )       ‚Ñô  ‚Ñ∞    \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})   is of this form. 2  Projective space bundles  As a special case, when   ‚Ñ∞   ‚Ñ∞   \mathcal{E}   is locally free of rank    n  +  1      n  1    n+1   , we get a projective bundle     ‚Ñô   (  ‚Ñ∞  )       ‚Ñô  ‚Ñ∞    \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})   over   X   X   X   of relative dimension   n   n   n   . Indeed, if we take an open cover of X by open affines    U  =   Spec   (  A  )        U    Spec  A     U=\mathrm{Spec}(A)   such that when restricted to each of these,   ‚Ñ∞   ‚Ñ∞   \mathcal{E}   is free over A , then          ‚Ñô   (  ‚Ñ∞  )    |     p   -  1     (  U  )     ‚âÉ    Proj  A    [   x  0   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  n   ]    =   ‚Ñô  A  n   =   ‚Ñô  U  n    ,       similar-to-or-equals   evaluated-at    ‚Ñô  ‚Ñ∞      superscript  p    1    U       Proj  A     subscript  x  0   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  n           subscript   superscript  ‚Ñô  n   A         subscript   superscript  ‚Ñô  n   U      \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})|_{p^{-1}(U)}\simeq\operatorname{Proj}\,A[x_{0},\dots,x%
 _{n}]=\mathbb{P}^{n}_{A}=\mathbb{P}^{n}_{U},     and hence    ‚Ñô   (  ‚Ñ∞  )       ‚Ñô  ‚Ñ∞    \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})   is a projective space bundle.
