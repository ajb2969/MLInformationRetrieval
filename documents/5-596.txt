Bessel's inequality

In mathematics, especially functional analysis, Bessel's inequality is a statement about the coefficients of an element 
 
 
 
  in a Hilbert space with respect to an orthonormal sequence.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a Hilbert space, and suppose that 
 
 
 
  is an orthonormal sequence in 
 
 
 
 
 . Then, for any 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  one has



where 〈•,•〉 denotes the inner product in the Hilbert space 
 
 
 
 . If we define the infinite sum


 
  consisting of 'infinite sum' of vector resolute

 
  in direction 
 
 
 
 , Bessel's inequality tells us that this series converges. One can think of it that there exists 
 
 
 
  which can be described in terms of potential basis 
 
 
 
 .
For a complete orthonormal sequence (that is, for an orthonormal sequence which is a basis), we have Parseval's identity, which replaces the inequality with an equality (and consequently 
 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 ).
Bessel's inequality follows from the identity:


 
  which holds for any natural n.
