3-aminobutyryl-CoA ammonia-lyase

In enzymology, a 3-aminobutyryl-CoA ammonia-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-3-aminobutyryl-CoA 
 
 
 
  crotonoyl-CoA + NH3


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-3-aminobutyryl-CoA, and two products, crotonoyl-CoA and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically ammonia lyases, which cleave carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-3-aminobutyryl-CoA ammonia-lyase (crotonoyl-CoA-forming). Other names in common use include L-3-aminobutyryl-CoA deaminase, and L-3-aminobutyryl-CoA ammonia-lyase.
