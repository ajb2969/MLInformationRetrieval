   Organorhodium chemistry      Organorhodium chemistry   Organorhodium chemistry is the chemistry of organometallic compounds containing a rhodium - carbon  chemical bond , and the study of rhodium and rhodium compounds as catalysts in organic reactions . 1  Stable organorhodium compounds and transient organorhodium intermediates are used as catalyst such as in olefin hydroformylation , olefin hydrogenation , olefin isomerization and the Monsanto process 2  Description  Organometallic rhodium compounds share many characteristics with those of cobalt (see organocobalt compounds ), which is also in group 9 . Rhodium can exist in oxidation states of -III to +IV, but rhodium(I) and rhodium(III) are the most common. Rhodium(I) compounds (d 8 configuration) can occur with square planar or trigonal bipyramidal geometries, while rhodium (III) compounds (d 6 configuration) typically have an octahedral geometry. 3  Examples  Important homoleptic rhodium compounds are tetrarhodium dodecacarbonyl Rh 4 (CO) 10 and hexadecacarbonylhexarhodium Rh 6 (CO) 16 . The hexarhodium compound is less preferred due to poor solubility. Both are important catalysts in hydroformylation of alkenes often accompanied by a phosphine ligand:      RHC  =    CH  2    +   CO   +    H  2     →     Rh  4     (  CO  )   10    /   PPh  3      RCH  2    CH  2   CHO     fragments  RHC    subscript  CH  2    CO    subscript  normal-H  2         subscript  Rh  4    subscript  CO  10     subscript  PPh  3    normal-→     subscript  RCH  2    subscript  CH  2   CHO    \mathrm{RHC=CH_{2}\ +\ CO\ +\ H_{2}\ \xrightarrow{Rh_{4}(CO)_{10}/PPh_{3}}\ \ %
 RCH_{2}CH_{2}CHO}     Nitrobenzene reduction is another reaction catalysed by this compound type:        PhNO  2    +   C  6     H  6    +   3    CO    →    Rh  6     (  CO  )   16      PhNHCOPh   +   2    CO  2      fragments   subscript  PhNO  2     subscript  normal-C  6    subscript  normal-H  6    3  CO      subscript  Rh  6    subscript  CO  16    normal-→    PhNHCOPh   2   subscript  CO  2     \mathrm{PhNO_{2}\ +\ C_{6}H_{6}\ +\ 3\ CO\ \xrightarrow{Rh_{6}(CO)_{16}}\ \ %
 PhNHCOPh\ +\ 2\ CO_{2}}     Cyclooctadiene rhodium chloride dimer [RhCl(COD)] 2 is investigated for its use in C-H bond activation . Sandwich compounds of rhodium, such as rhodocene , and half-sandwich compounds like [(η 5 - Cp )Rh(CO) 2 ] are well known.  Another hexarhodium complex is (C 60 )Rh 6 (C 60 ), where the rhodium center has two large fullerene ligands around it.

Although such compounds are well documented in the literature rhodium(III) cyclometalates with azo function are spare. A typical example of this category viz. novel hexacoordinated orthometalated rhodium(III) thiolato complex trans-[Rh(C ∧ N ∧ S)Cl(PPh 3 ) 2 ] was synthesized from benzyl 2-(phenylazo)phenyl thioether and RhCl 3 ·3H 2 O in the presence of excess PPh 3 via in situ C(sp 2 )−H and C(sp 3 )−S bond scissions. This is the first example for a coordination compound of (phenylazo)thiolate ligand. The mechanism of formation of orthometalated azobenzene derivative was described to proceed via initial coordination of azo-nitrogen followed by electrophilic substitution at the pendant phenyl ring. PPh 3 plays a crucial role in the C(sp 3 )−S cleavage process. Reductive cleavage by single electron transfer (SET) mechanism is likely to be operative for the C−S bond cleavage. Unlike analogous (phenylazo)phenolato compound the orthometalated thiolato complex exhibits a fully reversible oxidative wave at 0.82 V vs Ag/AgCl and this response is supposed to be primarily centered on the thiolato sulfur atom. 4  See also   Chemical bonds of carbon with other elements in the periodic table:   References  "       Synthesis of Organometallic Compounds: A Practical Guide Sanshiro Komiya Ed.
