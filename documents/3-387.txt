In statistics, the Wishart distribution is a generalization to multiple dimensions of the chi-squared distribution, or, in the case of non-integer degrees of freedom, of the gamma distribution. It is named in honor of John Wishart, who first formulated the distribution in 1928.1
It is a family of probability distributions defined over symmetric, nonnegative-definite matrix-valued random variables (“random matrices”). These distributions are of great importance in the estimation of covariance matrices in multivariate statistics. In Bayesian statistics, the Wishart distribution is the conjugate prior of the inverse covariance-matrix of a multivariate-normal random-vector.
Definition
Suppose 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
  matrix, each row of which is independently drawn from a 

 
 -variate normal distribution with zero mean:



Then the Wishart distribution is the probability distribution of the 
 
 
 
  random matrix  XT X}} known as the scatter matrix. One indicates that 
 
 
 
  has that probability distribution by writing



The positive integer 
 
 
 
  is the number of degrees of freedom. Sometimes this is written 
 
 
 
 . For 
 
 
 
  the matrix 
 
 
 
  is invertible with probability 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  is invertible.
If 
 
 
 
  then this distribution is a chi-squared distribution with 
 
 
 
  degrees of freedom.
Occurrence
The Wishart distribution arises as the distribution of the sample covariance matrix for a sample from a multivariate normal distribution. It occurs frequently in likelihood-ratio tests in multivariate statistical analysis. It also arises in the spectral theory of random matrices and in multidimensional Bayesian analysis.2 It is also encountered in wireless communications, while analyzing the performance of Rayleigh fading MIMO wireless channels .3
Probability density function
The Wishart distribution can be characterized by its probability density function as follows:
Let 
 
 
 
  be a 
 
 
 
  symmetric matrix of random variables that is positive definite. Let 
 
 
 
  be a (fixed) positive definite matrix of size 
 
 
 
 .
Then, if 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  has a Wishart distribution with 
 
 
 
  degrees of freedom if it has a probability density function given by



where 
 
 
 
  denotes determinant and  is the multivariate gamma function defined as



In fact the above definition can be extended to any real 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
 , then the Wishart no longer has a density—instead it represents a singular distribution that takes values in a lower-dimension subspace of the space of 
 
 
 
  matrices.4
Use in Bayesian statistics
In Bayesian statistics, in the context of the multivariate normal distribution, the Wishart distribution is the conjugate prior to the precision matrix  Σ−1}}, where 
 
 
 
  is the covariance matrix.
Choice of parameters
The least informative, proper Wishart prior is obtained by setting 
 
 
 
 .
The prior mean of  is 
 
 
 
 , suggesting that a reasonable choice for  would be , where  is some prior guess for the covariance matrix.
Properties
Log-expectation
Note the following formula:5



where 
 
 
 
  is the multivariate digamma function (the derivative of the log of the multivariate gamma function).
This plays a role in variational Bayes derivations for Bayes networks involving the Wishart distribution.
Entropy
The information entropy of the distribution has the following formula:6



where 
 
 
 
  is the normalizing constant of the distribution:



This can be expanded as follows:



Cross-Entropy
The cross entropy of two Wishart distributions 
 
 
 
  with parameters 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with parameters 
 
 
 
  is



Note that when 
 
 
 
  we recover the entropy.
KL-Divergence
The Kullback–Leibler divergence of 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  is



Characteristic function
The characteristic function of the Wishart distribution is



In other words,



where 
 
 
 
  denotes expectation. (Here 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are matrices the same size as 
 
 
 
 (
 
 
 
  is the identity matrix); and 
 
 
 
  is the square root of −1).7
Theorem
If a 
 
 
 
  random matrix 
 
 
 
  has a Wishart distribution with 
 
 
 
  degrees of freedom and variance matrix 
 
 
 
  — write 
 
 
 
  — and 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
  matrix of rank

 
 , then 8



Corollary 1
If 
 
 
 
  is a nonzero 
 
 
 
  constant vector, then:9



In this case, 
 
 
 
  is the chi-squared distribution and 
 
 
 
  (note that 
 
 
 
  is a constant; it is positive because 
 
 
 
  is positive definite).
Corollary 2
Consider the case where  (0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0)}} (that is, the 
 
 
 
 -th element is one and all others zero). Then corollary 1 above shows that



gives the marginal distribution of each of the elements on the matrix's diagonal.
Noted statistician George Seber points out that the Wishart distribution is not called the “multivariate chi-squared distribution” because the marginal distribution of the off-diagonal elements is not chi-squared. Seber prefers to reserve the term multivariate for the case when all univariate marginals belong to the same family.10
Estimator of the multivariate normal distribution
The Wishart distribution is the sampling distribution of the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) of the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution.11 A derivation of the MLE uses the spectral theorem.
Bartlett decomposition
The Bartlett decomposition of a matrix 
 
 
 
  from a 
 
 
 
 -variate Wishart distribution with scale matrix 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  degrees of freedom is the factorization:



where 
 
 
 
  is the Cholesky factor of 
 
 
 
 , and:



where 
 
 
 
  and  independently.12 This provides a useful method for obtaining random samples from a Wishart distribution.13
Marginal distribution of matrix elements
Let 
 
 
 
  be a 
 
 
 
  variance matrix characterized by correlation coefficient





Multiplying through the Bartlett decomposition above, we find that a random sample from the 
 
 
 
  Wishart distribution is



The diagonal elements, most evidently in the first element, follow the  distribution with 
 
 
 
  degrees of freedom (scaled by ) as expected. The off-diagonal element is less familiar but can be identified as a normal variance-mean mixture where the mixing density is a  distribution. The corresponding marginal probability density for the off-diagonal element is therefore the variance-gamma distribution



where  is the modified Bessel function of the second kind.14 Similar results may be found for higher dimensions, but the interdependence of the off-diagonal correlations becomes increasingly complicated. It is also possible to write down the moment-generating function even in the noncentral case (essentially the nth power of Craig (1936)15 equation 10) although the probability density becomes an infinite sum of Bessel functions.
The possible range of the shape parameter
It can be shown 16 that the Wishart distribution can be defined if and only if the shape parameter 
 
 
 
  belongs to the set



This set is named after Gindikin, who introduced it17 in the seventies in the context of gamma distributions on homogeneous cones. However, for the new parameters in the discrete spectrum of the Gindikin ensemble, namely,



the corresponding Wishart distribution has no Lebesgue density.
Relationships to other distributions

The Wishart distribution is related to the Inverse-Wishart distribution, denoted by 
 
 
 
 , as follows: If  and if we do the change of variables  X−1}}, then $\mathbf{C}\sim W_p^{-1}(\mathbf{V}^{-1},n)$. This relationship may be derived by noting that the absolute value of the Jacobian determinant of this change of variables is C{{!}}p+1}}, see for example equation (15.15) in.18
In Bayesian statistics, the Wishart distribution is a conjugate prior for the precision parameter of the multivariate normal distribution, when the mean parameter is known.19
A generalization is the multivariate gamma distribution.
A different type of generalization is the normal-Wishart distribution, essentially the product of a multivariate normal distribution with a Wishart distribution.
