   Generalized quadrangle      Generalized quadrangle   (Figure)  GQ(2,2), the Doily   In geometry , a generalized quadrangle is an incidence structure whose main feature is the lack of any triangles (yet containing many quadrangles). A generalized quadrangle is by definition a polar space of rank two. They are the  and near n-gons with n = 4. They are also precisely the partial geometries pg( s , t ,α) with α = 1.  Definition  A generalized quadrangle is an incidence structure ( P , B ,I), with I ⊆ P × B an incidence relation , satisfying certain axioms . Elements of P are by definition the points of the generalized quadrangle, elements of B the lines . The axioms are the following:   There is an s ( s ≥ 1) such that on every line there are exactly s + 1 points. There is at most one point on two distinct lines.  There is a t ( t ≥ 1) such that through every point there are exactly t + 1 lines. There is at most one line through two distinct points.  For every point p not on a line L , there is a unique line M and a unique point q , such that p is on M , and q on M and L .   ( s , t ) are the parameters of the generalized quadrangle. The parameters are allowed to be infinite. If either s or t is one, the generalized quadrangle is called trivial . For example, the 3x3 grid with P = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} and L = {123, 456, 789, 147, 258, 369} is a trivial GQ with s = 2 and t = 1. A generalized quadrangle with parameters ( s , t ) is often denoted by GQ( s , t ).  The smallest non-trivial generalized quadrangle is GQ(2,2) , whose representation has been dubbed "the doily" by Stan Payne in 1973.  Properties        |  P  |   =    (    s  t   +  1   )    (   s  +  1   )          P         s  t   1     s  1      |P|=(st+1)(s+1)          |  B  |   =    (    s  t   +  1   )    (   t  +  1   )          B         s  t   1     t  1      |B|=(st+1)(t+1)          (  s  +  t  )   |  s  t   (  s  +  1  )    (  t  +  1  )      fragments   fragments  normal-(  s   t  normal-)   normal-|  s  t   fragments  normal-(  s   1  normal-)    fragments  normal-(  t   1  normal-)     (s+t)|st(s+1)(t+1)         s  ≠  1  ⟹  t  ≤   s  2         s  1    normal-⟹    t        superscript  s  2      s\neq 1\Longrightarrow t\leq s^{2}         t  ≠  1  ⟹  s  ≤   t  2         t  1    normal-⟹    s        superscript  t  2      t\neq 1\Longrightarrow s\leq t^{2}      Graphs  (Figure)   Line graph of generalized quadrangle    There are two interesting graphs that can be obtained from a generalized quadrangle.   The collinearity graph having as vertices the points of a generalized quadrangle, with the collinear points connected. This graph is a strongly regular graph with parameters ((s+1)(st+1), s(t+1), s-1, t+1) where (s,t) is the order of the GQ.  The incidence graph whose vertices are the points and lines of the generalized quadrangle and two vertices are adjacent if one is a point, the other a line and the point lies on the line. The incidence graph of a generalized quadrangle is characterized by being a connected , bipartite graph with diameter four and girth eight. Therefore it is an example of a Cage . Incidence graphs of configurations are today generally called Levi graphs , but the original Levi graph was the incidence graph of the GQ(2,2).   Duality  If ( P , B ,I) is a generalized quadrangle with parameters ( s , t ), then ( B , P ,I −1 ), with I −1 the inverse incidence relation, is also a generalized quadrangle. This is the dual generalized quadrangle . Its parameters are ( t , s ). Even if s = t , the dual structure need not be isomorphic with the original structure.  Generalized quadrangles with lines of size 3  There are precisely five (possible degenerate) generalized quadrangles where each line has three point incident with it, the quadrangle with empty line set, the quadrangle with all lines through a fixed point corresponding to the windmill graph Wd(3,n) , grid of size 3x3, the W(2) quadrangle and the unique GQ(2,4). These five quadrangles corresponds to the five root systems in the ADE classes  A n , D n , E 6 , E 7 and E 8 , i.e., the simply laced root systems. See 1 and. 2  Classical generalized quadrangles  When looking at the different cases for polar spaces of rank at least three, and extrapolating them to rank 2, one finds these (finite) generalized quadrangles :   A hyperbolic quadric      Q  +    (  3  ,  q  )        superscript  Q     3  q     Q^{+}(3,q)   , a parabolic quadric    Q   (  4  ,  q  )       Q   4  q     Q(4,q)   and an elliptic quadric     Q  -    (  5  ,  q  )        superscript  Q     5  q     Q^{-}(5,q)   are the only possible quadrics in projective spaces over finite fields with projective index 1. We find these parameters respectively :        Q   (  3  ,  q  )    :    s  =  q   ,   t  =  1       normal-:    Q   3  q     formulae-sequence    s  q     t  1      Q(3,q):\ s=q,t=1   (this is just a grid)       Q   (  4  ,  q  )    :    s  =  q   ,   t  =  q       normal-:    Q   4  q     formulae-sequence    s  q     t  q      Q(4,q):\ s=q,t=q          Q   (  5  ,  q  )    :    s  =  q   ,   t  =   q  2        normal-:    Q   5  q     formulae-sequence    s  q     t   superscript  q  2       Q(5,q):\ s=q,t=q^{2}      A hermitian variety    H   (  n  ,   q  2   )       H   n   superscript  q  2      H(n,q^{2})   has projective index 1 if and only if n is 3 or 4. We find :        H   (  3  ,   q  2   )    :    s  =   q  2    ,   t  =  q       normal-:    H   3   superscript  q  2      formulae-sequence    s   superscript  q  2      t  q      H(3,q^{2}):\ s=q^{2},t=q          H   (  4  ,   q  2   )    :    s  =   q  2    ,   t  =   q  3        normal-:    H   4   superscript  q  2      formulae-sequence    s   superscript  q  2      t   superscript  q  3       H(4,q^{2}):\ s=q^{2},t=q^{3}      A symplectic polarity in    P  G   (    2  d   +  1   ,  q  )       P  G       2  d   1   q     PG(2d+1,q)   has a maximal isotropic subspace of dimension 1 if and only if    d  =  1      d  1    d=1   . Here, we find a generalized quadrangle    W   (  3  ,  q  )       W   3  q     W(3,q)   , with     s  =  q   ,   t  =  q      formulae-sequence    s  q     t  q     s=q,t=q   .   The generalized quadrangle derived from    Q   (  4  ,  q  )       Q   4  q     Q(4,q)   is always isomorphic with the dual of    W   (  3  ,  q  )       W   3  q     W(3,q)   , and they are both self-dual and thus isomorphic to each other if and only if   q   q   q   is even.  Non-classical examples   Let O be a hyperoval in    P  G   (  2  ,  q  )       P  G   2  q     PG(2,q)   with q an even prime power , and embed that projective (desarguesian) plane   π   π   \pi   into    P  G   (  3  ,  q  )       P  G   3  q     PG(3,q)   . Now consider the incidence structure     T  2  *    (  O  )        superscript   subscript  T  2     O    T_{2}^{*}(O)   where the points are all points not in   π   π   \pi   , the lines are those not on   π   π   \pi   , intersecting   π   π   \pi   in a point of O , and the incidence is the natural one. This is a (q-1,q+1) -generalized quadrangle.  Let q be a prime power (odd or even) and consider a symplectic polarity   θ   θ   \theta   in    P  G   (  3  ,  q  )       P  G   3  q     PG(3,q)   . Choose a random point p and define    π  =   p  θ       π   superscript  p  θ     \pi=p^{\theta}   . Let the lines of our incidence structure be all absolute lines not on   π   π   \pi   together with all lines through p which are not on   π   π   \pi   , and let the points be all points of    P  G   (  3  ,  q  )       P  G   3  q     PG(3,q)   except those in   π   π   \pi   . The incidence is again the natural one. We obtain once again a (q-1,q+1) -generalized quadrangle   Restrictions on parameters  By using grids and dual grids, any integer  z , z ≥ 1 allows generalized quadrangles with parameters (1, z ) and ( z ,1). Apart from that, only the following parameters have been found possible until now, with q an arbitrary prime power :      (  q  ,  q  )     q  q    (q,q)         (  q  ,   q  2   )     q   superscript  q  2     (q,q^{2})   and    (   q  2   ,  q  )      superscript  q  2   q    (q^{2},q)         (   q  2   ,   q  3   )      superscript  q  2    superscript  q  3     (q^{2},q^{3})   and    (   q  3   ,   q  2   )      superscript  q  3    superscript  q  2     (q^{3},q^{2})         (   q  -  1   ,   q  +  1   )       q  1     q  1     (q-1,q+1)   and    (   q  +  1   ,   q  -  1   )       q  1     q  1     (q+1,q-1)     References   S.
