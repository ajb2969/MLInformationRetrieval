Dual pair

In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics a dual pair or dual system is a pair of vector spaces with an associated bilinear map to the base field.
A common method in functional analysis, when studying normed vector spaces, is to analyze the relationship of the space to its continuous dual, the vector space of all possible continuous linear forms on the original space. A dual pair generalizes this concept to arbitrary vector spaces, with the duality being expressed as a bilinear map. Using the bilinear map, semi norms can be constructed to define a polar topology on the vector spaces and turn them into locally convex spaces, generalizations of normed vector spaces.
Definition
A dual pair1 is a 3-tuple 
 
 
 
  consisting of two vector spaces

 
  and 
 
 
 
  over the same field

 
  and a bilinear map


 
  with


 
  and



We call 
 
 
 
  the duality pairing, and say that it puts 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
in duality.
When the two spaces are a vector space 
 
 
 
  (or a module over a ring in general) and its dual 
 
 
 
 , we call the canonical duality pairing 
 
 
 
  the natural pairing.
We call two elements 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
orthogonal if


 
  We call two sets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
orthogonal if each pair of elements from 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are orthogonal.
Example
A vector space 
 
 
 
  together with its algebraic dual

 
  and the bilinear map defined as


 
  forms a dual pair.
A locally convex topological vector space space 
 
 
 
  together with its topological dual

 
  and the bilinear map defined as


 
  forms a dual pair. (To show this, the Hahn–Banach theorem is needed.)
For each dual pair 
 
 
 
  we can define a new dual pair 
 
 
 
  with



A sequence space

 
  and its beta dual

 
  with the bilinear map defined as


 
  form a dual pair.
Comment
Associated with a dual pair 
 
 
 
  is an injective linear map from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  given by


 
  There is an analogous injective map from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .
In particular, if either of 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  is finite-dimensional, these maps are isomorphisms.
