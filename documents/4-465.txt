Its dual polyhedron is the rhombicuboctahedron .  Dimensions  The 24 faces are kites . The short and long edges of each kite are in the ratio    1  :    (   2  -    1   2      )   ≈  1   :   1.292893  …        normal-:  1      2    1    2     1     normal-:      1.292893  normal-…      \scriptstyle 1:(2-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})\approx 1:1.292893\dots     If its smallest edges have length 1, its surface area is    6    29  -   2   2          6      29    2    2        \scriptstyle{6\sqrt{29-2\sqrt{2}}}   and its volume is     122  +   71   2           122    71    2       \scriptstyle{\sqrt{122+71\sqrt{2}}}   .  Occurrences in nature and culture  The deltoidal icositetrahedron is a crystal habit often formed by the mineral analcime and occasionally garnet . The shape is often called a trapezohedron in mineral contexts, although in solid geometry that name has another meaning .  Orthogonal projections  The ''deltoidal icositetrahedron '' has three symmetry positions, all centered on vertices:      Orthogonal projections     Projective symmetry     Image     Dual image     Related polyhedra  The great triakis octahedron is a stellation of the deltoidal icositetrahedron.  Dyakis dodecahedron  The deltoidal icositetrahedron is topologically equivalent to a cube whose faces are divided in quadrants. It can also be projected onto a regular octahedron , with kite faces, or more general quadrilaterals with pyritohedral symmetry. In Conway polyhedron notation , they represent an ortho operation to a cube or octahedron.  In crystallography a rotational variation is called a dyakis dodecahedron 2 3 or diploid . 4      Octahedral , O h , order 24   Pyritohedral , T h , order 12      (Figure)  Partial cubic honeycomb.png   (Figure)  Deltoidal icositetrahedron octahedral.png      Related polyhedra and tilings  The deltoidal icositetrahedron is one of a family of duals to the uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.  This polyhedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of deltoidal polyhedra with face figure (V3.4.n.4), and continues as tilings of the hyperbolic plane . These face-transitive figures have (*n32) reflectional symmetry .  See also   Deltoidal hexecontahedron  " The Haunter of the Dark ", a story by H.P.
