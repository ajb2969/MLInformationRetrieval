   Klein four-group      Klein four-group     In mathematics , the Klein four-group (or just Klein group or Vierergruppe (), often symbolized by the letter V or as K 4 ) is the group  , the direct product of two copies of the cyclic group of order 2. It was named Vierergruppe by Felix Klein in 1884. 1 The Klein group's Cayley table is given by:         1   a   b   c       1   1   a   b   c     a   a   1   c   b     b   b   c   1   a     c   c   b   a   1     The Klein four-group is also defined by the group presentation       V  =   ⟨   a  ,  b   ∣    a  2   =   b  2   =    (   a  b   )   2   =  1   ⟩    .      normal-V   inner-product   a  b        superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2         superscript    a  b   2        1       \mathrm{V}=\langle a,b\mid a^{2}=b^{2}=(ab)^{2}=1\rangle.     All non- identity elements of the Klein group have order 2, thus any two non-identity elements can serve as generators in the above presentation. The Klein four-group is the smallest non- cyclic group . It is however an abelian group , and isomorphic to the dihedral group of order (cardinality) 4; it is the only dihedral group that is abelian.  The Klein four-group is also isomorphic to the direct sum  , so that it can be represented as the bit vectors under bitwise XOR (or equivalently under bitwise addition modulo 2 ); note that 00 is the group's identity element in this case. The Klein four-group is thus an example of an elementary abelian 2-group , which is also called a Boolean group . The Klein four-group is thus also the group generated by the symmetric difference as the binary operation on the subsets of a powerset of a set with two elements, i.e. over a field of sets with four elements, e.g.    {  ∅  ,   {  α  }   ,   {  β  }   ,   {  α  ,  β  }   }       α    β    α  β     \{\emptyset,\{\alpha\},\{\beta\},\{\alpha,\beta\}\}   ; the empty set is the group's identity element in this case.  Another numerical construction of the Klein four-group is the set  with the operation being multiplication modulo 8 . Here a is 3, b is 5, and c = ab is .  Geometrically, in 2D the Klein four-group is the symmetry group of a rhombus and of a rectangle which are not squares , the four elements being the identity, the vertical reflection, the horizontal reflection, and a 180 degree rotation.  In 3D there are three different symmetry groups that are algebraically the Klein four-group V:   one with three perpendicular 2-fold rotation axes: D 2  one with a 2-fold rotation axis, and a perpendicular plane of reflection:  one with a 2-fold rotation axis in a plane of reflection (and hence also in a perpendicular plane of reflection): .   The three elements of order 2 in the Klein four-group are interchangeable: the automorphism group of V is the group of permutations of these three elements.  The Klein four-group's permutations of its own elements can be thought of abstractly as its permutation representation on 4 points:  (Figure)  Other permutations of four objects, forming V as well  See: 4 element subsets of S 4    V = { (), (1,2)(3,4), (1,3)(2,4), (1,4)(2,3) }   In this representation, V is a normal subgroup of the alternating group A 4 (and also the symmetric group S 4 ) on 4 letters. In fact, it is the kernel of a surjective group homomorphism from S 4 to S 3 . According to Galois theory , the existence of the Klein four-group (and in particular, this representation of it) explains the existence of the formula for calculating the roots of quartic equations in terms of radicals , as established by Lodovico Ferrari : the map corresponds to the resolvent cubic, in terms of Lagrange resolvents .  The Klein four-group as a subgroup of A 4 is not the automorphism group of any simple graph . It is, however, the automorphism group of a two-vertex graph where the vertices are connected to each other with two edges, making the graph non-simple. It is also the automorphism group of the following simple graph, but in the permutation representation  where the points are labeled top-left, bottom-left, top-right, bottom-right:         In the construction of finite rings , eight of the eleven rings with four elements have the Klein four-group as their additive substructure.  If R × denotes the multiplicative group of non-zero reals and R + the multiplicative group of positive reals , R × × R × is the group of units of the ring R × R and R + × R + is a subgroup of R × × R × (in fact it is the component of the identity of R × × R × ). The quotient group ( R × × R × ) / ( R + × R + ) is isomorphic to the Klein four-group. In a similar fashion, the group of units of the split-complex number ring , when divided by its identity component, also results in the Klein four-group.  In music composition the four-group is the basic group of permutations in the twelve-tone technique . In that instance the Cayley table is written; 2      S   I:   R:   RI:     I:   S   RI   R     R:   RI   S   I     RI:   R   I   S     See also   Quaternion group   References  Further reading   M.
