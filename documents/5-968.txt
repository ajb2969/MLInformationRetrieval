He spent the rest of his life studying number theory . He applied his expertise to finding factors of large numbers of the form a n ± b n , such as Mersenne numbers (     2  p   -  1       superscript  2  p   1    2^{p}-1   ) and Fermat numbers (     2   2  n    +  1       superscript  2   superscript  2  n    1    2^{2^{n}}+1   ) which have b = 1. His work is continued in the Cunningham project .  References   A. E. Western, J. London Math.
