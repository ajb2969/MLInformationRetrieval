   K-distribution      K-distribution   The K-distribution is a probability distribution that arises as the consequence of a statistical or probabilistic model used in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. The K-distribution is formed by compounding two separate probability distributions , one representing the radar cross-section , and the other representing speckle that is a characteristic of coherent imaging.  The model used to represent the observed intensity   X   X   X   involves compounding two gamma distributions . In each case a reparameterisation of the usual form of the family of gamma distributions is used, such that the parameters are:  :*the mean of the distribution, and  :*the usual shape parameter.  Density  The model is that random variable    X   X   X   has a gamma distribution with mean   σ   σ   \sigma   and shape parameter   L   L   L   , with   σ   σ   \sigma   being treated as a random variable having another gamma distribution, this time with mean   μ   μ   \mu   and shape parameter   ν   ν   \nu   . The result is that   X   X   X   has the following probability density function (pdf) for    x  >  0      x  0    x>0   : 1        f  X    (  x  ;  μ  ,  ν  ,  L  )    =    2  x     (    L  ν  x   μ   )     L  +  ν   2     1   Γ   (  L  )   Γ   (  ν  )      K   ν  -  L     (   2     L  ν  x   μ     )           subscript  f  X    x  μ  ν  L        2  x    superscript      L  ν  x   μ       L  ν   2      1    normal-Γ  L  normal-Γ  ν     subscript  K    ν  L      2        L  ν  x   μ        f_{X}(x;\mu,\nu,L)=\frac{2}{x}\left(\frac{L\nu x}{\mu}\right)^{\frac{L+\nu}{2}%
 }\frac{1}{\Gamma(L)\Gamma(\nu)}K_{\nu-L}\left(2\sqrt{\frac{L\nu x}{\mu}}\right)   ,  where   K   K   K   is a modified Bessel function of the second kind. In this derivation, the K-distribution is a compound probability distribution . It is also a product distribution : 2 it is the distribution of the product of two independent random variables, one having a gamma distribution with mean 1 and shape parameter   L   L   L   , the second having a gamma distribution with mean   μ   μ   \mu   and shape parameter   ν   ν   \nu   .  This distribution derives from a paper by Jakeman and Pusey (1978).  Moments  The mean and variance are given 3 by       E   (  X  )    =  μ       normal-E  X   μ    \operatorname{E}(X)=\mu           var   (  X  )    =    μ  2     ν  +  L  +  1    L  ν      .       var  X      superscript  μ  2       ν  L  1     L  ν       \operatorname{var}(X)=\mu^{2}\frac{\nu+L+1}{L\nu}.     Other properties  All the properties of the distribution are symmetric in   L   L   L   and   ν   ν   \nu   . 4  Differential equation  The pdf of the K-distribution is a solution of the following differential equation :      {          μ   x  2    f  ′′    (  x  )    -   μ  x   (    L  +  ν   -  3   )    f  ′    (  x  )     +   f   (  x  )    (    μ   (   L  -  1   )    (   ν  -  1   )    -   L  ν  x    )     =  0   ,          f   (  1  )    =    2    (    L  ν   μ   )     L  2   +   ν  2      K   ν  -  L     (   2     L  ν   μ     )     Γ   (  L  )   Γ   (  ν  )      ,          f  ′    (  1  )    =    2    (    L  ν   μ   )     L  +  ν   2     (     (   L  -  1   )    K   L  -  ν     (   2     L  ν   μ     )    -      L  ν   μ     K    L  -  ν   +  1     (   2     L  ν   μ     )     )     Γ   (  L  )   Γ   (  ν  )         }               μ   superscript  x  2    superscript  f  ′′   x     μ  x      L  ν   3    superscript  f  normal-′   x      f  x      μ    L  1     ν  1      L  ν  x      0         f  1       2   superscript      L  ν   μ       L  2     ν  2      subscript  K    ν  L      2        L  ν   μ        normal-Γ  L  normal-Γ  ν            superscript  f  normal-′   1       2   superscript      L  ν   μ       L  ν   2          L  1    subscript  K    L  ν      2        L  ν   μ              L  ν   μ     subscript  K      L  ν   1      2        L  ν   μ          normal-Γ  L  normal-Γ  ν         \left\{\begin{array}[]{l}\mu x^{2}f^{\prime\prime}(x)-\mu x(L+\nu-3)f^{\prime}%
