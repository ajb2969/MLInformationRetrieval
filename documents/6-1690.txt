   Discriminant of an algebraic number field      Discriminant of an algebraic number field   In mathematics , the discriminant of an algebraic number field is a numerical invariant that, loosely speaking, measures the size of the ( ring of integers of the) algebraic number field. More specifically, it is proportional to the volume of the fundamental domain of the ring of integers, and it regulates which primes are ramified .  The discriminant is one of the most basic invariants of a number field, and occurs in several important analytic formulas such as the functional equation of the Dedekind zeta function of K , and the analytic class number formula for K . An old theorem of Hermite states that there are only finitely many number fields of bounded discriminant, however determining this quantity is still an open problem , and the subject of current research. 1  The discriminant of K can be referred to as the absolute discriminant of K to distinguish it from the relative discriminant of an extension  K / L of number fields. The latter is an ideal in the ring of integers of L , and like the absolute discriminant it indicates which primes are ramified in K / L . It is a generalization of the absolute discriminant allowing for L to be bigger than Q ; in fact, when L = Q , the relative discriminant of K / Q is the principal ideal of Z generated by the absolute discriminant of K .  Definition  Let K be an algebraic number field, and let O K be its ring of integers. Let b 1 , ..., b n be an integral basis of O K (i.e. a basis as a Z -module ), and let {σ 1 , ..., σ n } be the set of embeddings of K into the complex numbers (i.e. injective  ring homomorphisms  K → C ). The discriminant of K is the square of the determinant of the n by n  matrix  B whose ( i , j )-entry is σ i ( b j ). Symbolically,        Δ  K   =    (   det   (       σ  1    (   b  1   )        σ  1    (   b  2   )      ⋯      σ  1    (   b  n   )          σ  2    (   b  1   )      ⋱     ⋮      ⋮     ⋱    ⋮        σ  n    (   b  1   )      ⋯    ⋯      σ  n    (   b  n   )       )    )   2    .       subscript  normal-Δ  K    superscript   det       subscript  σ  1    subscript  b  1       subscript  σ  1    subscript  b  2    normal-⋯     subscript  σ  1    subscript  b  n         subscript  σ  2    subscript  b  1    normal-⋱   missing-subexpression   normal-⋮    normal-⋮   missing-subexpression   normal-⋱  normal-⋮       subscript  σ  n    subscript  b  1    normal-⋯  normal-⋯     subscript  σ  n    subscript  b  n       2     \Delta_{K}=\left(\operatorname{det}\left(\begin{array}[]{cccc}\sigma_{1}(b_{1}%
 )&\sigma_{1}(b_{2})&\cdots&\sigma_{1}(b_{n})\\
 \sigma_{2}(b_{1})&\ddots&&\vdots\\
 \vdots&&\ddots&\vdots\\
 \sigma_{n}(b_{1})&\cdots&\cdots&\sigma_{n}(b_{n})\end{array}\right)\right)^{2}.    Equivalently, the trace from K to Q can be used. Specifically, define the trace form to be the matrix whose ( i , j )-entry is Tr K / Q ( b i b j ). This matrix equals B T B , so the discriminant of K is the determinant of this matrix.  Examples   Quadratic number fields : let d be a square-free integer , then the discriminant of    K  =   𝐐   (   d   )        K    𝐐    d      K=\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{d})   is 2          Δ  K   =   {     d      if  d   ≡   1     (   mod  4   )          4  d        if  d   ≡   2  ,   3     (   mod  4   )      .             subscript  normal-Δ  K    cases    d      if  d    annotated  1   pmod  4         4  d       if  d    2   annotated  3   pmod  4           \Delta_{K}=\left\{\begin{array}[]{ll}d&\text{if }d\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod%
 }}4)\\
 4d&\text{if }d\equiv 2,3\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}4).\\
 \end{array}\right.       An integer that occurs as the discriminant of a quadratic number field is called a fundamental discriminant . 3     Cyclotomic fields : let n > 2 be an integer, let ζ n be a primitive n th root of unity , and let K n = Q (ζ n ) be the n th cyclotomic field. The discriminant of K n is given by 4 5          Δ   K  n    =     (   -  1   )     φ   (  n  )    /  2      n   φ   (  n  )        ∏   p  |  n      p    φ   (  n  )    /   (   p  -  1   )             subscript  normal-Δ   subscript  K  n       superscript    1       φ  n   2       superscript  n    φ  n      subscript  product   fragments  p  normal-|  n     superscript  p      φ  n     p  1          \Delta_{K_{n}}=(-1)^{\varphi(n)/2}\frac{n^{\varphi(n)}}{\displaystyle\prod_{p|%
 n}p^{\varphi(n)/(p-1)}}       where    φ   (  n  )       φ  n    \varphi(n)   is Euler's totient function , and the product in the denominator is over primes p dividing n .    Power bases: In the case where the ring of integers has a power integral basis , that is, can be written as O K = Z [α], the discriminant of K is equal to the discriminant of the minimal polynomial of α. To see this, one can chose the integral basis of O K to be b 1 = 1, b 2 = α, b 3 = α 2 , ..., b n = α n −1 . Then, the matrix in the definition is the Vandermonde matrix associated to α i = σ i (α), whose determinant squared is     \prod_{1\leq i    which is exactly the definition of the discriminant of the minimal polynomial.    Let K = Q (α) be the number field obtained by adjoining a root α of the polynomial  x 3 − x 2 − 2 x − 8. This is Richard Dedekind 's original example of a number field whose ring of integers does not possess a power basis. An integral basis is given by {1, α, α(α + 1)/2} and the discriminant of K is −503. 6 7  Repeated discriminants: the discriminant of a quadratic field uniquely identifies it, but this is not true, in general, for higher-degree number fields. For example, there are two non-isomorphic  cubic fields of discriminant 3969. They are obtained by adjoining a root of the polynomial or , respectively. 8   Basic results   Brill's theorem : 9 The sign of the discriminant is (−1) r 2 where r 2 is the number of complex places of K . 10  A prime p ramifies in K if, and only if, p divides Δ K . 11  Stickelberger's theorem : 12           Δ  K   ≡    0  or  1      (   mod  4   )     .       subscript  normal-Δ  K    annotated    0  or  1    pmod  4      \Delta_{K}\equiv 0\text{ or }1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}4).         Minkowski's bound : 13 Let n denote the degree of the extension K / Q and r 2 the number of complex places of K , then            |   Δ  K   |    1  /  2    ≥     n  n    n  !      (   π  4   )    r  2     ≥     n  n    n  !

 \frac{n^{n}}{n!}\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)^{n/2}.         Minkowski's theorem : 14 If K is not Q , then |Δ K | > 1 (this follows directly from the Minkowski bound).  Hermite–Minkowski theorem : 15 Let N be a positive integer. There are only finitely many (up to isomorphisms) algebraic number fields K with |Δ K | < N . Again, this follows from the Minkowski bound together Hermite's theorem (There are only finitely many algebraic number fields with prescribed discriminant).   History  The definition of the discriminant of a general algebraic number field, K , was given by Dedekind in 1871. 16 At this point, he already knew the relationship between the discriminant and ramification. 17  Hermite's theorem predates the general definition of the discriminant with Charles Hermite publishing a proof of it in 1857. In 1877, Alexander von Brill determined the sign of the discriminant. Leopold Kronecker first stated Minkowski's theorem in 1882, though the first proof was given by Hermann Minkowski in 1891. In the same year, Minkowski published his bound on the discriminant. Near the end of the nineteenth century, Ludwig Stickelberger obtained his theorem on the residue of the discriminant modulo four. 18  == Relative discriminant== The discriminant defined above is sometimes referred to as the absolute discriminant of K to distinguish it from the relative discriminant Δ K / L of an extension of number fields K / L , which is an ideal in O L . The relative discriminant is defined in a fashion similar to the absolute discriminant, but must take into account that ideals in O L may not be principal and that there may not be an O L basis of O K . Let {σ 1 , ..., σ n } be the set of embeddings of K into C which are the identity on L . If b 1 , ..., b n is any basis of K over L , let d ( b 1 , ..., b n ) be the square of the determinant of the n by n matrix whose ( i , j )-entry is σ i ( b j ). Then, the relative discriminant of K / L is the ideal generated by the d ( b 1 , ..., b n ) as { b 1 , ..., b n } varies over all integral bases of K / L . (i.e. bases with the property that b i ∈ ''O K'' for all i .) Alternatively, the relative discriminant of K / L is the norm of the different of K / L . 19 When L = Q , the relative discriminant Δ K / Q is the principal ideal of Z generated by the absolute discriminant Δ K . In a tower of fields  K / L / F the relative discriminants are related by       Δ   K  /  F    =    𝒩   L  /  F     (   Δ   K  /  L    )    Δ   L  /  F    [  K  :  L  ]          subscript  normal-Δ    K  F       subscript  𝒩    L  F     subscript  normal-Δ    K  L     superscript   subscript  normal-Δ    L  F     fragments  normal-[  K  normal-:  L  normal-]       \Delta_{K/F}=\mathcal{N}_{L/F}\left({\Delta_{K/L}}\right)\Delta_{L/F}^{[K:L]}     where   𝒩   𝒩   \mathcal{N}   denotes relative norm . 20  Ramification  The relative discriminant regulates the ramification data of the field extension K / L . A prime ideal p of L ramifies in K if, and only if, it divides the relative discriminant Δ K / L . An extension is unramified if, and only if, the discriminant is the unit ideal. 21 The Minkowski bound above shows that there are no non-trivial unramified extensions of Q . Fields larger than Q may have unramified extensions, for example, for any field with class number greater than one, its Hilbert class field is a non-trivial unramified extension.  Root discriminant  The root discriminant of a number field, K , of degree n , often denoted rd K , is defined as the n -th root of the absolute value of the (absolute) discriminant of K . 22 The relation between relative discriminants in a tower of fields shows that the root discriminant does not change in an unramified extension. The existence of a class field tower provides bounds on the root discriminant: the existence of an infinite class field tower over Q (√-m) where m = 3·5·7·11·19 shows that there are infinitely many fields with root discriminant 2√ m ≈ 296.276. 23 If we let r and 2 s be the number of real and complex embeddings, so that n = r + 2 s , put ρ = r / n and σ = 2 s / n . Set α ( ρ , σ ) to be the infimum of rd K for K with ( r', 2 s') = ( ρn , σn ). We have (for all n large enough) 24       α   (  ρ  ,  σ  )    ≥    60.8  ρ    22.3  σ          α   ρ  σ       superscript  60.8  ρ    superscript  22.3  σ      \alpha(\rho,\sigma)\geq 60.8^{\rho}22.3^{\sigma}     and on the assumption of the generalized Riemann hypothesis        α   (  ρ  ,  σ  )    ≥    215.3  ρ    44.7  σ     .        α   ρ  σ       superscript  215.3  ρ    superscript  44.7  σ      \alpha(\rho,\sigma)\geq 215.3^{\rho}44.7^{\sigma}.     So we have α (0,1) 25 proves that for totally real fields, the root discriminant is > 14, with 1229 exceptions.  Relation to other quantities   When embedded into    K   ⊗  𝐐   𝐑      subscript  tensor-product  𝐐   K  𝐑    K\otimes_{\mathbf{Q}}\mathbf{R}   , the volume of the fundamental domain of O K is     |   Δ  K   |          subscript  normal-Δ  K      \sqrt{|\Delta_{K}|}   (sometimes a different measure is used and the volume obtained is     2   -   r  2       |   Δ  K   |         superscript  2     subscript  r  2          subscript  normal-Δ  K       2^{-r_{2}}\sqrt{|\Delta_{K}|}   , where r 2 is the number of complex places of K ).  Due to its appearance in this volume, the discriminant also appears in the functional equation of the Dedekind zeta function of K , and hence in the analytic class number formula, and the Brauer–Siegel theorem .  The relative discriminant of K / L is the Artin conductor of the regular representation of the Galois group of K / L . This provides a relation to the Artin conductors of the characters of the Galois group of K / L , called the conductor-discriminant formula . 26   Notes  References  Primary sources            Secondary sources              Further reading     "  Category:Algebraic number theory     ↩   Definition 5.1.2 of ↩  Proposition 2.7 of ↩  ↩  , pp. 30–31 ↩  , p. 64 ↩  ↩  ↩  Lemma 2.2 of ↩  Corollary III.2.12 of ↩  Exercise I.2.7 of ↩  Proposition III.2.14 of ↩  Theorem III.2.17 of ↩  Theorem III.2.16 of ↩   ↩  All facts in this paragraph can be found in ↩  ↩  Corollary III.2.10 of  or Proposition III.2.15 of ↩   ↩  ↩   ↩  Section 4.4 of ↩
