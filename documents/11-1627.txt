   Triphosphate—protein phosphotransferase      Triphosphate—protein phosphotransferase   In enzymology , a triphosphate-protein phosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   triphosphate + [microsomal-membrane protein]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + phospho-[microsomal-membrane protein]   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are triphosphate and microsomal-membrane protein , whereas its two products are diphosphate and phospho-[microsomal-membrane protein ].  Classification  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups that are not covered by other phosphotransferase families.  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is triphosphate:[microsomal-membrane-protein] phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include diphosphate:microsomal-membrane-protein O-phosphotransferase , (erroneous) , DiPPT (erroneous) , pyrophosphate:protein phosphotransferase (erroneous) , diphosphate-protein phosphotransferase (erroneous) , diphosphate:[microsomal-membrane-protein] O-phosphotransferase , and (erroneous) .
