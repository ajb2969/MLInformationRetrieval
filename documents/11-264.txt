   Arsenite-transporting ATPase      Arsenite-transporting ATPase   In enzymology , an arsenite-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O + arsenitein   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + arseniteout   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , H 2 O , and arsenite , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and arsenite .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (arsenite-exporting) .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
