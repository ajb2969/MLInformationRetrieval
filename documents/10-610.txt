   Sepiapterin reductase      Sepiapterin reductase   Sepiapterin reductase is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the SPR  gene . 1 2 3  Function  Sepiapterin reductase (7,8-dihydrobiopterin:NADP + oxidoreductase; EC 1.1.1.153) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of various carbonyl substances, including derivatives of pteridines, and belongs to a group of enzymes called aldo-keto reductases. SPR plays an important role in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin . 4  Reaction  Sepiapterin reductase ( SPR ) catalyzes the chemical reaction  L-erythro-7,8-dihydrobiopterin + NADP+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   sepiapterin + NADPH + H+  Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-erythro-7,8-dihydrobiopterin and NADP + , whereas its three products are sepiapterin , NADPH , and a single hydrogen ion (H + ).  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , to be specific, those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 7,8-dihydrobiopterin:NADP + oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in folate biosynthesis . 5  References  Further reading                        "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of known structure     ↩  ↩  ↩   http://brenda-enzymes.info/enzyme.php?ecno=1.1.1.153 ↩
