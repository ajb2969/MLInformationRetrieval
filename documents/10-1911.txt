   2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-pentonate aldolase      2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-pentonate aldolase   In enzymology , a 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-pentonate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-pentonate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyruvate + glycolaldehyde   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-pentonate , and two products , pyruvate and glycolaldehyde .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-pentonate glycolaldehyde-lyase (pyruvate-forming) . Other names in common use include 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-pentonate aldolase , 3-deoxy-D-pentulosonic acid aldolase , and 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-pentonate glycolaldehyde-lyase . This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions .  References      "  Category:EC 4.1.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
