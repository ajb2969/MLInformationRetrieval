Bernoulli differential equation

In mathematics, an ordinary differential equation of the form



is called a Bernoulli equation when nâ‰ 1, 0, which is named after Jacob Bernoulli, who discussed it in 1695 . Bernoulli equations are special because they are nonlinear differential equations with known exact solutions.
Solution
Let 
 
 
 
  and


 
  be a solution of the linear differential equation


 
  Then we have that 
 
 
 
  is a solution of


 
  And for every such differential equation, for all 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
  as solution for 
 
 
 
 .
Example
Consider the Bernoulli equation (more specifically Riccati's equation).1


 
  We first notice that 
 
 
 
  is a solution. Division by 
 
 
 
  yields


 
  Changing variables gives the equations








 
  which can be solved using the integrating factor


 
  Multiplying by 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  Note that left side is the derivative of 
 
 
 
 . Integrating both sides results in the equations








 
  The solution for 
 
 
 
  is
