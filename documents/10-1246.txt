   2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase (acylating)      2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase (acylating)   In enzymology , a 2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase (acylating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate + CoA + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-methylpropanoyl-CoA + CO 2 + NADH   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate , CoA , and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 2-methylpropanoyl-CoA , CO 2 , and NADH .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate:NAD+ 2-oxidoreductase (CoA-methyl-propanoylating) . Other names in common use include 2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase , and alpha-ketoisovalerate dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation .
