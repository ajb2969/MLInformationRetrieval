Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase

In enzymology, a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4-phosphate 
 
 
 
  ADP + 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 3,4-bisphosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4-phosphate, whereas its two products are ADP and 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 3,4-bisphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol-4-phosphate 3-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include type II phosphoinositide 3-kinase, C2-domain-containing phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase. This enzyme participates in phosphatidylinositol signaling system.
