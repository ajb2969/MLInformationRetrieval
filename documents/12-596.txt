Silverman's game

In game theory, Silverman's game is a zero sum game played on the unit square. It is named for David Silverman.
It is played by two players on a given set S of positive real numbers. Before play starts, a threshold 
 
 
 
  and penalty 
 
 
 
  are chosen with 
 
 
 
  and 1  y. Then the payoff to A is 1 if 1 -\nu if x/y > T; equal numbers involve zero payoff. Thus each player seeks to choose the larger number, but there is a penalty of 
 
 
 
 
  for choosing too large a number.
