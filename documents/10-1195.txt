   Cellobiose dehydrogenase (acceptor)      Cellobiose dehydrogenase (acceptor)   In enzymology , a cellobiose dehydrogenase (acceptor) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cellobiose + acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cellobiono-1,5-lactone + reduced acceptor   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cellobiose and acceptor , whereas its two products are cellobiono-1,5-lactone and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , to be specific those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cellobiose:acceptor 1-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include cellobiose dehydrogenase , cellobiose oxidoreductase , Phanerochaete chrysosporium cellobiose oxidoreductase , CBOR , cellobiose oxidase , cellobiose:oxygen 1-oxidoreductase , CDH , and cellobiose:(acceptor) 1-oxidoreductase . It employs sometimes one cofactor , FAD , but in most cases both a heme and a FAD. It makes the enzyme to one of the more complex extracellulae oxidoreductases. It is produced by wood degrading organisms.  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
