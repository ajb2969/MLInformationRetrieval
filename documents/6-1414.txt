Interleave sequence




Interleave sequence

In mathematics, an interleave sequence is obtained by merging or shuffling two sequences.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a set, and let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be two sequences in 
 
 
 
  The interleave sequence is defined to be the sequence 
 
 
 
  Formally, it is the sequence 
 
 
 
  given by



Properties

The interleave sequence 
 
 
 
  is convergent if and only if the sequences 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are convergent and have the same limit.1


Consider two real numbers a and b greater than zero and smaller than 1. One can interleave the sequences of digits of a and b, which will determine a third number c, also greater than zero and smaller than 1. In this way one obtains an injection from the square (0, 1)×(0, 1) to the interval (0, 1). Different radixes give rise to different injections; the one for the binary numbers is called the Z-order curve or Morton code.2
