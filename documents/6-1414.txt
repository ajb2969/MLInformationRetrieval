   Interleave sequence      Interleave sequence   In mathematics , an interleave sequence is obtained by merging or shuffling two sequences .  Let   S   S   S   be a set , and let    (   x  i   )     subscript  x  i    (x_{i})   and    (   y  i   )     subscript  y  i    (y_{i})   ,     i  =   0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  …    ,      i   0  1  2  normal-…     i=0,1,2,...,   be two sequences in    S  .    S   S.   The interleave sequence is defined to be the sequence      x  0   ,   y  0   ,   x  1   ,   y  1   ,  …   .      subscript  x  0    subscript  y  0    subscript  x  1    subscript  y  1   normal-…    x_{0},y_{0},x_{1},y_{1},\dots.   Formally, it is the sequence       (   z  i   )   ,  i   =  0   ,   1  ,  2  ,  …      formulae-sequence      subscript  z  i   i   0    1  2  normal-…     (z_{i}),i=0,1,2,...   given by       z  i   :=   {      x  k       if  i   =   2  k  is even,         y  k       if  i   =    2  k   +   1  is odd.            fragments   subscript  z  i   assign   fragments  normal-{     subscript  x  k       if  i     2  k  is even,       subscript  y  k       if  i       2  k     1  is odd.          z_{i}:=\left\{\begin{matrix}x_{k}&\mbox{ if }i=2k\mbox{ is even,}\\
 y_{k}&\mbox{ if }i=2k+1\mbox{ is odd.}\end{matrix}\right.     Properties   The interleave sequence    (   z  i   )     subscript  z  i    (z_{i})   is convergent  if and only if the sequences    (   x  i   )     subscript  x  i    (x_{i})   and    (   y  i   )     subscript  y  i    (y_{i})   are convergent and have the same limit. 1    Consider two real numbers  a and b greater than zero and smaller than 1. One can interleave the sequences of digits of a and b , which will determine a third number c , also greater than zero and smaller than 1. In this way one obtains an injection from the square (0, 1)×(0, 1) to the interval (0, 1). Different radixes give rise to different injections; the one for the binary numbers is called the Z-order curve or Morton code. 2   References  "  Category:Real analysis  Category:Sequences and series     . ↩  . ↩
