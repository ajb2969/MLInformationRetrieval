   Barometric formula      Barometric formula   The barometric formula , sometimes called the exponential  atmosphere or isothermal  atmosphere , is a formula used to model how the pressure (or density ) of the air changes with altitude .  Pressure equations  There are two different equations for computing pressure at various height regimes below 86 km (or 278,400 feet). The first equation is used when the value of standard temperature lapse rate is not equal to zero; the second equation is used when standard temperature lapse rate equals zero.  Equation 1:      P  =    P  b   ⋅    [    T  b     T  b   +    L  b   ⋅   (   h  -   h  b    )      ]       g  0   ⋅  M     R  *   ⋅   L  b            P   normal-⋅   subscript  P  b    superscript   delimited-[]     subscript  T  b      subscript  T  b    normal-⋅   subscript  L  b     h   subscript  h  b           normal-⋅   subscript  g  0   M    normal-⋅   superscript  R     subscript  L  b         {P}=P_{b}\cdot\left[\frac{T_{b}}{T_{b}+L_{b}\cdot(h-h_{b})}\right]^{\textstyle%

Values of P b of b = 1 through b = 6 are obtained from the application of the appropriate member of the pair equations 1 and 2 for the case when h = h b+1 . 3      Subscript b   Height above sea level   Static pressure   Standard temperature (K)   Temperature lapse rate       (m)   (ft)   (pascals)   (inHg)   (K/m)     0   0   0   101325.00   29.92126     1   11,000   36,089   22632.10   6.683245     2   20,000   65,617   5474.89   1.616734     3   32,000   104,987   868.02   0.2563258     4   47,000   154,199   110.91   0.0327506     5   51,000   167,323   66.94   0.01976704     6   71,000   232,940   3.96   0.00116833     Density equations  The expressions for calculating density are nearly identical to calculating pressure. The only difference is the exponent in Equation 1.  There are two different equations for computing density at various height regimes below 86 geometric km (84,852 geopotential meters or 278,385.8 geopotential feet). The first equation is used when the value of standard temperature lapse rate is not equal to zero; the second equation is used when standard temperature lapse rate equals zero.
