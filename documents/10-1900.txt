   Phosphonoacetate hydrolase      Phosphonoacetate hydrolase   In enzymology , a phosphonoacetate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   phosphonoacetate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetate + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phosphonoacetate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are acetate and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carbon-phosphorus bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphonoacetate phosphonohydrolase . This enzyme participates in aminophosphonate metabolism . It employs one cofactor , zinc .  Structural studies  The structure of this enzyme, with the PDB accession code , shows it adopts the alkaline phosphatase fold.
