   Aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase      Aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , an aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an aromatic alcohol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   an aromatic aldehyde + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are aromatic alcohol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are aromatic aldehyde , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aryl-alcohol:NAD + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol dehydrogenase , benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase , and coniferyl alcohol dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in 5 metabolic pathways : tyrosine metabolism , phenylalanine metabolism , biphenyl degradation , toluene and xylene degradation , and caprolactam degradation .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
