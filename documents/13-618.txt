   Locally catenative sequence      Locally catenative sequence   In mathematics , a locally catenative sequence is a sequence of words in which each word can be constructed as the concatenation of previous words in the sequence. 1  Formally, an infinite sequence of words w ( n ) is locally catenative if, for some positive integers k and i 1 ,... i k :        w   (  n  )    =   w   (   n  -   i  1    )   w   (   n  -   i  2    )   …  w   (   n  -   i  k    )   for  n   ≥   max   {   i  1   ,  …  ,   i  k   }     .          w  n     w    n   subscript  i  1    w    n   subscript  i  2    normal-…  w    n   subscript  i  k    for  n           subscript  i  1   normal-…   subscript  i  k       w(n)=w(n-i_{1})w(n-i_{2})\ldots w(n-i_{k})\text{ for }n\geq\max\{i_{1},\ldots,%
 i_{k}\}\,.     Some authors use a slightly different definition in which encodings of previous words are allowed in the concatenation. 2  Examples  The sequence of Fibonacci words  S ( n ) is locally catenative because       S   (  n  )    =   S   (   n  -  1   )   S   (   n  -  2   )   for  n   ≥  2 .          S  n     S    n  1   S    n  2   for  n        2 .     S(n)=S(n-1)S(n-2)\text{ for }n\geq 2\,.     The sequence of Thue–Morse words  T ( n ) is not locally catenative by the first definition. However, it is locally catenative by the second definition because        T   (  n  )    =   T   (   n  -  1   )   μ   (   T   (   n  -  1   )    )   for  n   ≥   1    ,          T  n     T    n  1   μ    T    n  1    for  n        1     T(n)=T(n-1)\mu(T(n-1))\text{ for }n\geq 1\,,   where the encoding & mu; replaces 0 with 1 and 1 with 0.
