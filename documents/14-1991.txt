   Stochastic discount factor      Stochastic discount factor   A Stochastic discount factor (SDF) is a concept in financial economics and mathematical finance .  If there are n assets with initial prices     p  1   ,  …  ,   p  n       subscript  p  1   normal-…   subscript  p  n     p_{1},...,p_{n}   at the beginning of a period and payoffs      x  ~   1   ,  …  ,    x  ~   n       subscript   normal-~  x   1   normal-…   subscript   normal-~  x   n     \tilde{x}_{1},...,\tilde{x}_{n}   at the end of the period (all x's are random variables ), then SDF is any random variable    m  ~     normal-~  m    \tilde{m}   satisfying        E   (    m  ~     x  ~   i    )    =    p  i   ,   ∀  i     .        E     normal-~  m    subscript   normal-~  x   i       subscript  p  i    for-all  i      E(\tilde{m}\tilde{x}_{i})=p_{i},\quad\forall i.     This definition is of fundamental importance in asset pricing . The name "stochastic discount factor" reflects the fact that the price of an asset can be computed by "discounting" the future cash flow     x  ~   i     subscript   normal-~  x   i    \tilde{x}_{i}   by the stochastic factor    m  ~     normal-~  m    \tilde{m}   and then taking the expectation. 1  Properties  If each    p  i     subscript  p  i    p_{i}   is positive, by using     R  i   =     x  ~   i   /   p  i         subscript  R  i      subscript   normal-~  x   i    subscript  p  i      R_{i}=\tilde{x}_{i}/p_{i}   to denote the return, we can rewrite the definition as        E   (    m  ~     R  ~   i    )    =   1  ,   ∀  i     ,        E     normal-~  m    subscript   normal-~  R   i      1   for-all  i      E(\tilde{m}\tilde{R}_{i})=1,\quad\forall i,   and this implies        E   [    m  ~    (     R  ~   i   -    R  ~   j    )    ]    =   0  ,   ∀  i   ,  j    .        E   delimited-[]     normal-~  m      subscript   normal-~  R   i    subscript   normal-~  R   j        0   for-all  i   j     E[\tilde{m}(\tilde{R}_{i}-\tilde{R}_{j})]=0,\quad\forall i,j.     Also, if there is a portfolio made up of the assets, then the SDF satisfies        E   (    m  ~    x  ~    )    =  p   ,    E   (    m  ~    R  ~    )    =  1.      formulae-sequence      E     normal-~  m    normal-~  x     p       E     normal-~  m    normal-~  R     1.     E(\tilde{m}\tilde{x})=p,E(\tilde{m}\tilde{R})=1.     Notice the definition of covariance , it can also be written as       1  =    c  o  v   (   m  ~   ,   R  ~   )    +   E   (   m  ~   )   E   (   R  ~   )      .      1      c  o  v    normal-~  m    normal-~  R       E   normal-~  m   E   normal-~  R       1=cov(\tilde{m},\tilde{R})+E(\tilde{m})E(\tilde{R}).     Suppose there is a risk-free asset. Then     R  ~   =   R  f        normal-~  R    subscript  R  f     \tilde{R}=R_{f}   implies     E   (   m  ~   )    =   1  /   R  f          E   normal-~  m      1   subscript  R  f      E(\tilde{m})=1/R_{f}   . Substituting this into the last expression and rearranging gives the following formula for the risk premium of any asset or portfolio with return    R  ~     normal-~  R    \tilde{R}   :         E   (   R  ~   )    -   R  f    =   -    R  f   c  o  v   (   m  ~   ,   R  ~   )      .          E   normal-~  R     subscript  R  f         subscript  R  f   c  o  v    normal-~  m    normal-~  R        E(\tilde{R})-R_{f}=-R_{f}cov(\tilde{m},\tilde{R}).     This shows that risk premiums are determined by covariances with any SDF. 2  The existence of an SDF is equivalent to the law of one price . 3  The existence of a strictly positive SDF is equivalent to the absence of arbitrage opportunities.  Other names  The stochastic discount factor is sometimes referred to as the pricing kernel . This name comes from the fact that if the expectation      E   (     m  ~      x  ~   i    )       E     normal-~  m    subscript   normal-~  x   i      E(\tilde{m}\,\tilde{x}_{i})     is written as an integral, then    m  ~     normal-~  m    \tilde{m}   can be interpreted as the kernel function in an integral transform . 4  Other names for the SDF sometimes encountered are the marginal rate of substitution (the ratio of utility of states, when utility is separable and additive, though discounted by the risk-neutral rate), a change of measure , or a state-price density . 5  References  "  Category:Stochastic calculus  Category:Financial economics  Category:Mathematical finance     ↩    ↩
