Stochastic discount factor

A Stochastic discount factor (SDF) is a concept in financial economics and mathematical finance.
If there are n assets with initial prices 
 
 
 
  at the beginning of a period and payoffs 
 
 
 
  at the end of the period (all x's are random variables), then SDF is any random variable 
 
 
 
  satisfying



This definition is of fundamental importance in asset pricing. The name "stochastic discount factor" reflects the fact that the price of an asset can be computed by "discounting" the future cash flow 
 
 
 
  by the stochastic factor 
 
 
 
  and then taking the expectation.1
Properties
If each 
 
 
 
  is positive, by using 
 
 
 
  to denote the return, we can rewrite the definition as


 
  and this implies



Also, if there is a portfolio made up of the assets, then the SDF satisfies



Notice the definition of covariance, it can also be written as



Suppose there is a risk-free asset. Then 
 
 
 
  implies 
 
 
 
 . Substituting this into the last expression and rearranging gives the following formula for the risk premium of any asset or portfolio with return 
 
 
 
 :



This shows that risk premiums are determined by covariances with any SDF.2
The existence of an SDF is equivalent to the law of one price.3
The existence of a strictly positive SDF is equivalent to the absence of arbitrage opportunities.
Other names
The stochastic discount factor is sometimes referred to as the pricing kernel. This name comes from the fact that if the expectation



is written as an integral, then 
 
 
 
  can be interpreted as the kernel function in an integral transform.4
Other names for the SDF sometimes encountered are the marginal rate of substitution (the ratio of utility of states, when utility is separable and additive, though discounted by the risk-neutral rate), a change of measure, or a state-price density.5
