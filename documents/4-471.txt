Net |} In geometry, a pentagonal icositetrahedron or pentagonal icosikaitetrahedron1 is a Catalan solid which is the dual of the snub cube. In crystalography it is also called a gyroid.23
It has two distinct forms, which are mirror images (or "enantiomorphs") of each other.
Geometry
Denote the tribonacci constant by t, approximately 1.8393. (See snub cube for a geometric explanation of the tribonacci constant.) Then the pentagonal faces have four angles of 
 
 
 
  114.8° and one angle of 
 
 
 
  80.75°. The pentagon has three short edges of unit length each, and two long edges of length 
 
 
 
 . The acute angle is between the two long edges.
If its dual snub cube has unit edge length, its surface area is 
 
 
 
 
  and its volume is 
 
 
 
 .4
Orthogonal projections
The ''pentagonal icositetrahedron '' has three symmetry positions, two centered on vertices, and one on midedge.

Related polyhedra and tilings
 This polyhedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of polyhedra and tilings of pentagons with face configurations (V3.3.3.3.n). (The sequence progresses into tilings the hyperbolic plane to any n.) These face-transitive figures have (n32) rotational symmetry. 
The ''pentagonal icositetrahedron '' is second in a series of dual snub polyhedra and tilings with face configuration V3.3.4.3.n. 
The pentagonal icositetrahedron is one of a family of duals to the uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.
