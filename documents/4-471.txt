In crystalography it is also called a gyroid . 2 3  It has two distinct forms, which are mirror images (or " enantiomorphs ") of each other.  Geometry  Denote the tribonacci constant by t , approximately 1.8393. (See snub cube for a geometric explanation of the tribonacci constant.) Then the pentagonal faces have four angles of      cos   -  1     (    1  -  t   2   )    ≈         superscript     1        1  t   2    absent    \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1-t}{2}\right)\approx   114.8° and one angle of      cos   -  1     (   2  -  t   )    ≈         superscript     1      2  t    absent    \cos^{-1}(2-t)\approx   80.75°. The pentagon has three short edges of unit length each, and two long edges of length      t  +  1   2   ≈  1.42          t  1   2   1.42    \frac{t+1}{2}\approx 1.42   . The acute angle is between the two long edges.  If its dual snub cube has unit edge length, its surface area is     3     22   (    5  t   -  1   )      4  t   -  3      ≈  19.29994        3        22      5  t   1        4  t   3      19.29994    \scriptstyle{3}\sqrt{\tfrac{22(5t-1)}{4t-3}}\scriptstyle{\approx 19.29994}   and its volume is       11   (   t  -  4   )     2   (    20  t   -  37   )      ≈  7.4474            11    t  4      2      20  t   37      7.4474    \sqrt{\tfrac{11(t-4)}{2(20t-37)}}\scriptstyle{\approx 7.4474}   . 4  Orthogonal projections  The ''pentagonal icositetrahedron '' has three symmetry positions, two centered on vertices, and one on midedge.      Orthogonal projections     Projective symmetry     Image     Dual image     Related polyhedra and tilings  This polyhedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of polyhedra and tilings of pentagons with face configurations (V3.3.3.3. n ). (The sequence progresses into tilings the hyperbolic plane to any n .) These face-transitive figures have (n32) rotational symmetry .  The ''pentagonal icositetrahedron '' is second in a series of dual snub polyhedra and tilings with face configuration V3.3.4.3. n .  The pentagonal icositetrahedron is one of a family of duals to the uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.
