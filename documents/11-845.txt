   Agmatine N4-coumaroyltransferase      Agmatine N4-coumaroyltransferase   In enzymology , an agmatine N4-coumaroyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-coumaroyl-CoA + agmatine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + N-(4-guanidinobutyl)-4-hydroxycinnamamide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-coumaroyl-CoA and agmatine , whereas its two products are CoA and N-(4-guanidinobutyl)-4-hydroxycinnamamide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , to be specific those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-coumaroyl-CoA:agmatine N4-coumaroyltransferase . Other names in common use include p-coumaroyl-CoA-agmatine N-p-coumaroyltransferase , agmatine coumaroyltransferase , and 4-coumaroyl-CoA:agmatine 4-N-coumaroyltransferase .
