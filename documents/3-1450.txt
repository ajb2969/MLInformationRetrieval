   Myriagon      Myriagon   In geometry , a myriagon is a polygon with 10000 sides. Several philosophers have used it to illustrate issues regarding thought. 1 2 3 4 5  A regular myriagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {10000} and can be constructed as a quasiregular truncated 5000-gon, t{5000}, which alternates two types of edges.  Properties  The measure of each internal angle in a regular myriagon is 179.964°. The area of a regular chiliagon with sides of length a is given by      A  =   2500   a  2    cot   π  10000         A    2500   superscript  a  2       π  10000       A=2500a^{2}\cot\frac{\pi}{10000}     Because 10000 = 2 4 × 5 4 , the number of sides is neither a product of distinct Fermat primes nor a power of two. Thus the regular myriagon is not a constructible polygon . Indeed, it is not even constructible with the use of neusis or an angle trisector, as the number of sides is neither a product of distinct Pierpont primes , nor a power of two, three, or six.  Myriagram  A myriagram is an 10000-sided star polygon . There are 1999 regular forms 6 given by Schläfli symbols of the form {10000/ n }, where n is an integer between 2 and 5000 that is coprime to 10000. There are also 3000 regular star figures in the remaining cases.
