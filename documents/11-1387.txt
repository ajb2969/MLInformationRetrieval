   Vitexin beta-glucosyltransferase      Vitexin beta-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a vitexin beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + vitexin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + vitexin 2"-O-beta-D-glucoside   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and vitexin , whereas its two products are UDP and vitexin 2"-O-beta-D-glucoside .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:vitexin 2 . This enzyme is also called uridine diphosphoglucose-vitexin 2"-glucosyltransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
