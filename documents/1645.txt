   Gross substitutes      Gross substitutes   The term gross substitutes is used in two slightly different meanings:   In microeconomics , two commodities   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   are called gross substitutes , if      Δ  demand   (  X  )     Δ  price   (  Y  )     >  0          normal-Δ  demand  X     normal-Δ  price  Y    0    \frac{\Delta\text{demand}(X)}{\Delta\text{price}(Y)}>0   . I.e., an increase in the price of one commodity causes people to want strictly more of the other commodity, since the commodities can substitute each other (bus and taxi are a common example).  In competitive equilibrium theory, a valuation function is said to have the gross substitutes (GS) property if for all pairs of commodities      Δ  demand   (  X  )     Δ  price   (  Y  )     ≥  0          normal-Δ  demand  X     normal-Δ  price  Y    0    \frac{\Delta\text{demand}(X)}{\Delta\text{price}(Y)}\geq 0   . I.e., the definition includes both substitute goods and independent goods , and only rules out complementary goods . See Utility functions on indivisible goods#Gross substitutes .
