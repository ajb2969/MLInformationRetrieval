The symbol 5 21 is from Coxeter , named for the length of the 3 branches of its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram. 1  This honeycomb was first studied by Gosset who called it a 9-ic semi-regular figure 2 (Gosset regarded honeycombs in n dimensions as degenerate n +1 polytopes).  Each vertex of the 5 21 honeycomb is surrounded by 2160 8-orthoplexes and 17280 8-simplices.  The vertex figure of Gosset's honeycomb is the semiregular 4 21 polytope . It is the final figure in the k 21 family.  This honeycomb is highly regular in the sense that its symmetry group (the affine     E  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  E   8    {\tilde{E}}_{8}   Weyl group) acts transitively on the k -faces for k ≤ 6. All of the k -faces for k ≤ 7 are simplices.  Construction  It is created by a Wythoff construction upon a set of 9 hyperplane mirrors in 8-dimensional space.  The facet information can be extracted from its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram .      Removing the node on the end of the 2-length branch leaves the 8-orthoplex , 6 11 .      Removing the node on the end of the 1-length branch leaves the 8-simplex .      The vertex figure is determined by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes the 4 21 polytope .      The edge figure is determined from the vertex figure by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes the 3 21 polytope .      The face figure is determined from the edge figure by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes the 2 21 polytope .      The cell figure is determined from the face figure by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes the 1 21 polytope .      Kissing number  Each vertex of this tessellation is the center of a 7-sphere in the densest known packing in 8 dimensions; its kissing number is 240, represented by the vertices of its vertex figure  4 21 .  E8 lattice       E  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  E   8    {\tilde{E}}_{8}   contains     A  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  A   8    {\tilde{A}}_{8}   as a subgroup of index 5760. 3 Both     E  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  E   8    {\tilde{E}}_{8}   and     A  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  A   8    {\tilde{A}}_{8}   can be seen as affine extensions of    A  8     subscript  A  8    A_{8}   from different nodes:       E  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  E   8    {\tilde{E}}_{8}   contains     D  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  D   8    {\tilde{D}}_{8}   as a subgroup of index 270. 4 Both     E  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  E   8    {\tilde{E}}_{8}   and     D  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  D   8    {\tilde{D}}_{8}   can be seen as affine extensions of    D  8     subscript  D  8    D_{8}   from different nodes:  The vertex arrangement of 5 21 is called the E8 lattice . 5  The E8 lattice can also be constructed as a union of the vertices of two 8-demicube honeycombs (called a D 8 2 or D 8 + lattice), as well as the union of the vertices of three 8-simplex honeycombs (called an A 8 3 lattice):    =  ∪  =  ∪  ∪    Related polytopes and honeycombs  The 5 21 is seventh in a dimensional series of semiregular polytopes , identified in 1900 by Thorold Gosset . Each member of the sequence has the previous member as its vertex figure . All facets of these polytopes are regular polytopes , namely simplexes and orthoplexes .
