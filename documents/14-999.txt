   Formally smooth map      Formally smooth map   In algebraic geometry and commutative algebra , a ring homomorphism     f  :   A  →  B      normal-:  f   normal-→  A  B     f:A\to B   is called formally smooth (from French : Formellement lisse ) if it satisfies the following infinitesimal lifting property:  Suppose B is given the structure of an A -algebra via the map f . Given a commutative  A -algebra, C , and a nilpotent ideal     N  ⊆  C      N  C    N\subseteq C   , any A -algebra homomorphism    B  →   C  /  N      normal-→  B    C  N     B\to C/N   may be lifted to an A -algebra map    B  →  C     normal-→  B  C    B\to C   . If moreover any such lifting is unique, then f is said to be formally étale . 1 2  Formally smooth maps were defined by Alexander Grothendieck in Éléments de géométrie algébrique IV.  For finitely presented morphisms, formal smoothness is equivalent to usual notion of smoothness.  References  "  Category:Commutative algebra  Category:Algebraic geometry     ↩  ↩
