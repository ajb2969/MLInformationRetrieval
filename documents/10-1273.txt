   Betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase      Betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   betaine aldehyde + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   betaine + NADH + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are betaine aldehyde , NAD + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are betaine , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is betaine-aldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include betaine aldehyde oxidase , BADH , betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase , and BetB . This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism .  Structural studies  , 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
