   Resolution inference      Resolution inference   In propositional logic , a resolution inference is an instance of the following rule : 1         Γ  1   ∪    {  ℓ  }    Γ  2    ∪   {   ℓ  ¯   }      Γ  1   ∪   Γ  2      |  ℓ  |            subscript  normal-Γ  1      normal-ℓ    subscript  normal-Γ  2      normal-¯  normal-ℓ        subscript  normal-Γ  1    subscript  normal-Γ  2       normal-ℓ     \frac{\Gamma_{1}\cup\left\{\ell\right\}\,\,\,\,\Gamma_{2}\cup\left\{\overline{%
 \ell}\right\}}{\Gamma_{1}\cup\Gamma_{2}}|\ell|     We call:   The clauses     Γ  1   ∪   {  ℓ  }        subscript  normal-Γ  1    normal-ℓ     \Gamma_{1}\cup\left\{\ell\right\}   and     Γ  2   ∪   {   ℓ  ¯   }        subscript  normal-Γ  2     normal-¯  normal-ℓ      \Gamma_{2}\cup\left\{\overline{\ell}\right\}   are the inference’s premises         Γ  1   ∪   Γ  2        subscript  normal-Γ  1    subscript  normal-Γ  2     \Gamma_{1}\cup\Gamma_{2}   (the resolvent of the premises) is its conclusion.    The literal   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   is the left resolved literal,    The literal    ℓ  ¯     normal-¯  normal-ℓ    \overline{\ell}   is the right resolved literal,        |  ℓ  |      normal-ℓ    |\ell|   is the resolved atom or pivot.   This rule can be generalized to first-order logic to: 2         Γ  1   ∪    {   L  1   }    Γ  2    ∪   {   L  2   }      (    Γ  1   ∪   Γ  2    )   ϕ    ϕ           subscript  normal-Γ  1       subscript  L  1     subscript  normal-Γ  2      subscript  L  2          subscript  normal-Γ  1    subscript  normal-Γ  2    ϕ    ϕ    \frac{\Gamma_{1}\cup\left\{L_{1}\right\}\,\,\,\,\Gamma_{2}\cup\left\{L_{2}%
 \right\}}{(\Gamma_{1}\cup\Gamma_{2})\phi}\phi     where   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is a most general unifier of    L  1     subscript  L  1    L_{1}   and     L  2   ¯     normal-¯   subscript  L  2     \overline{L_{2}}   and    Γ  1     subscript  normal-Γ  1    \Gamma_{1}   and    Γ  2     subscript  normal-Γ  2    \Gamma_{2}   have no common variables.  Example  The clauses     P   (  x  )    ,   Q   (  x  )         P  x     Q  x     P(x),Q(x)   and    ¬  P   (  b  )        P  b    \neg P(b)   can apply this rule with    [   b  /  x   ]     delimited-[]    b  x     [b/x]   as unifier.  Here x is a variable and b is a constant.         P   (  x  )    ,   Q   (  x  )   ¬  P   (  b  )      Q   (  B  )      [   b  /  x   ]            P  x     Q  x   P  b      Q  B     delimited-[]    b  x      \frac{P(x),Q(x)\,\,\,\,\neg P(b)}{Q(B)}[b/x]     Here we see that   The clauses     P   (  x  )    ,   Q   (  x  )         P  x     Q  x     P(x),Q(x)   and    ¬  P   (  x  )        P  x    \neg P(x)   are the inference’s premises        Q   (  b  )       Q  b    Q(b)   (the resolvent of the premises) is its conclusion.    The literal    P   (  x  )       P  x    P(x)   is the left resolved literal,    The literal    ¬  P   (  b  )        P  b    \neg P(b)   is the right resolved literal,       P   P   P   is the resolved atom or pivot.        [   b  /  x   ]     delimited-[]    b  x     [b/x]   is the most general unifier of the resolved literals.
