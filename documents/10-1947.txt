Aspartate 1-decarboxylase

In enzymology, an aspartate 1-decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-aspartate 
 
 
 
  beta-alanine + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-aspartate, and two products, beta-alanine and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-aspartate 1-carboxy-lyase (beta-alanine-forming). Other names in common use include aspartate alpha-decarboxylase, L-aspartate alpha-decarboxylase, aspartic alpha-decarboxylase, and L-aspartate 1-carboxy-lyase. This enzyme participates in alanine and aspartate metabolism and beta-alanine metabolism.
