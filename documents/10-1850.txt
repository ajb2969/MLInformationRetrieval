   Predominant chord      Predominant chord     In music theory , a predominant chord (also pre-dominant ) is any chord which normally resolves to a dominant chord. Benward & Saker (2009). Music in Theory and Practice: Volume II , Glossary, p.359. Eighth Edition. ISBN 978-0-07-310188-0. "Any chord in functional harmony that normally resolves to the dominant chord." Examples of predominant chords are the subdominant (IV), supertonic (ii), Neapolitan sixth and German sixth . Other examples are the secondary dominant (V/V), secondary leading tone chord , iv and ii°. Predominant chords may lead to secondary dominants. 1 Predominant chords both expand away from the tonic and lead to the dominant, affirming the dominant's pull to the tonic. 2 Thus they lack the stability of the tonic and the drive towards resolution of the dominant. 3 The predominant harmonic function is part of the fundamental harmonic progression of many classical works. 4 The submediant (vi) may be considered a predominant chord or a tonic substitute. 5  The dominant preparation is a chord or series of chords that precedes the dominant chord in a musical composition. Usually, the dominant preparation is derived from a circle of fifths progression. The most common dominant preparation chords are the supertonic , the subdominant , the V7/V , the Neapolitan chord (N 6 or II 6 ), and the augmented sixth chords (e.g., Fr +6 ).  (Figure)  The circle progression features a series of chords derived from the circle of fifths preceding the dominant and tonic.   In sonata form , the dominant preparation is in the development , immediately preceding the recapitulation . Ludwig van Beethoven 's sonata-form works generally have extensive dominant preparation — for example, in the first movement of the Sonata Pathétique , the dominant preparation lasts for 29 measures (mm. 169-197).
