TRNAMet cytidine acetyltransferase

TRNAMet cytidine acetyltransferase (, YpfI, TmcA) is an enzyme with system name acetyl-CoA:(elongator tRNAMet)-cytidine34 N4-acetyltransferase (ATP-hydrolysing).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

[elongator tRNAMet]-cytidine34 + ATP + acetyl-CoA

 
  CoA + [elongator tRNAMet]-N4-acetylcytidine34 + ADP + phosphate


The enzyme acetylates the wobble base C34 of the CAU anticodon of elongation-specific tRNAMet.
