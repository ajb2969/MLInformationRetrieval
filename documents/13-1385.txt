   Double turnstile      Double turnstile   In logic , the symbol ‚ä®,   ‚ä®   normal-‚ä®   \vDash   or   ‚äß   models   \models   is called the double turnstile . It is closely related to the turnstile symbol   ‚ä¢   proves   \vdash   , which has a single bar across the middle. It is often read as " entails ", " models ", "is a semantic consequence of" or "is stronger than". 1 In TeX , the turnstile symbols   ‚ä®   normal-‚ä®   \vDash   and   ‚äß   models   \models   are obtained from the commands \vDash and \models respectively. In Unicode it is encoded at  In LaTeX there is the turnstile package , which issues this sign in many ways, including the double turnstile, and is capable of putting labels below or above it, in the correct places. The article A Tool for Logicians is a tutorial on using this package.  Meaning  The double turnstile is a binary relation. It has several different meanings in different contexts:   To show semantic consequence , with a set of sentences on the left and a single sentence on the right, to denote that if every sentence on the left is true, the sentence on the right must be true, e.g.    Œì  ‚ä®  œÜ     normal-‚ä®  normal-Œì  œÜ    \Gamma\vDash\varphi   . This usage is closely related to the single-barred turnstile symbol which denotes syntactic consequence .  To show satisfaction , with a model (or truth-structure) on the left and a set of sentences on the right, to denote that the structure is a model for (or satisfies) the set of sentences, e.g.    ùíú  ‚äß  Œì     models  ùíú  normal-Œì    \mathcal{A}\models\Gamma   .  To denote a tautology ,     ‚ä®  œÜ     normal-‚ä®  absent  œÜ    \vDash\varphi   . which is to say that the expression   œÜ   œÜ   \varphi   is a semantic consequence of the empty set.
