   Schneider–Lang theorem      Schneider–Lang theorem   In mathematics, the Schneider–Lang theorem is a refinement by  of a theorem of  about the transcendence of values of meromorphic functions . The theorem implies both the Hermite–Lindemann and Gelfond–Schneider theorems , and implies the transcendence of some values of elliptic functions and elliptic modular functions .  Statement  The theorem deals with a number field  K and meromorphic functions f 1 , ..., f N , at least two of which are algebraically independent of orders ρ 1 and ρ 2 , and such that if we differentiate any of these functions then the result is a polynomial in f 1 , ..., f N with coefficients in K . Under these hypotheses the theorem states that if there are m distinct complex numbers  ω 1 , ..., ω m such that f i (ω j  ) is in K for all combinations of i and j , then m is bounded by      m  ≤   (   ρ  1   +   ρ  2   )    [  K  :  ℚ  ]   .     fragments  m    fragments  normal-(   subscript  ρ  1     subscript  ρ  2   normal-)    fragments  normal-[  K  normal-:  Q  normal-]   normal-.    m\leq(\rho_{1}+\rho_{2})[K:\mathbb{Q}].\,     Examples   If the two functions are f 1 = z and f 1 = e z then the theorem implies the Hermite–Lindemann theorem that e α is transcendental for any nonzero algebraic α, otherwise α, 2α, 3α,... would be an infinite number of values at which both f 1 and f 2 are algebraic.  Similarly taking the two function to be f 1 = e z and f 1 = e β z for β irrational algebraic implies the Gelfond–Schneider theorem that α β cannot be algebraic if α is algebraic and not 0 or 1. Otherwise log α , 2 log α , 3 log α would be an infinite number of values at which both f 1 and f 2 are algebraic.  Taking the three functions to be z , ℘(αz), ℘'(αz) shows that if g 2 and g 3 are algebraic then the Weierstrass P function ℘(α), which satisfies the differential equation          [    ℘  ′    (  z  )    ]   2   =    4    [   ℘   (  z  )    ]   3    -    g  2   ℘   (  z  )    -   g  3     ,       superscript   delimited-[]     superscript  Weierstrass-p  normal-′   z    2       4   superscript   delimited-[]    Weierstrass-p  z    3       subscript  g  2   Weierstrass-p  z    subscript  g  3      [\wp^{\prime}(z)]^{2}=4[\wp(z)]^{3}-g_{2}\wp(z)-g_{3},\,      is transcendental for any algebraic α.    Taking the functions to be z and e f ( z ) for a polynomial f of degree ρ shows that the number of points where the functions are all algebraic can grow linearly with the order ρ = deg( f ).   Proof  To prove the result Lang took two algebraically independent functions from f 1 , ..., f N , say f and g , and then created an auxiliary function which was simply a polynomial F in f and g . This auxiliary function could not be explicitly stated since f and g are not explicitly known. But using Siegel's lemma Lang showed how to make F in such a way that it vanished to a high order at the m complex numbers ω 1 ,...,ω m . Because of this high order vanishing it can be shown that a high-order derivative of F takes a value of small size one of the ω i s, "size" here referring to an algebraic property of a number. Using the maximum modulus principle Lang also found a separate way to estimate the absolute values of derivatives of F , and using standard results comparing the size of a number and its absolute value he showed that these estimates were contradicted unless the claimed bound on m holds.  Bombieri's theorem  and  generalized the result to functions of several variables. Bombieri showed that if K is an algebraic number field and f 1 , ..., f N are meromorphic functions of d complex variables of order at most ρ generating a field K ( f 1 , ..., f N ) of transcendence degree at least d + 1 that is closed under all partial derivatives, then the set of points where all the functions f n have values in K is contained in an algebraic hypersurface in C d of degree at most d ( d + 1)ρ[ K : Q ] + d gave a simpler proof of Bombieri's theorem, with a slightly stronger bound of d (ρ 1 +...+ρ d +1 )[ K : Q ] for the degree, where the ρ j are the orders of d +1 algebraically independent functions. The special case d = 1 gives the Schneider–Lang theorem, with a bound of (ρ 1 +ρ 2 )[ K : Q ] for the number of points.  Example. If p is a polynomial with integer coefficients then the functions z 1 ,..., z n ,e p ( z 1 ,..., z n ) are all algebraic at a dense set of points of the hypersurface p =0.  References    ,   S.
