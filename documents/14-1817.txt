   Nevanlinna function      Nevanlinna function    ''See also Nevanlinna theory    In mathematics , in the field of complex analysis , a Nevanlinna function is a complex function which is an analytic function on the open upper half-plane  H and has non-negative imaginary part . They map the upper half-plane to itself (or to a real constant), but are not necessarily injective or surjective . Functions with this property are sometimes also known as Herglotz , Pick or R functions.  Integral representation  Every Nevanlinna function N admits a representation         N   (  z  )    =   C  +   D  z   +    ∫  ℝ     (    1   λ  -  z    -   λ   1  +   λ  2      )   d  μ   (  λ  )       ,   z  ∈  ℍ    ,     formulae-sequence      N  z     C    D  z     subscript   ℝ         1    λ  z      λ    1   superscript  λ  2      d  μ  λ        z  ℍ     N(z)=C+Dz+\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left(\frac{1}{\lambda-z}-\frac{\lambda}{1+\lambda^%
 {2}}\right)d\mu(\lambda),\quad z\in\mathbb{H},     where C is a real constant, D is a non-negative constant and μ is a Borel measure on R satisfying the growth condition         ∫  ℝ     d  μ   (  λ  )     1  +   λ  2      <  ∞   .        subscript   ℝ       d  μ  λ     1   superscript  λ  2         \int_{\mathbb{R}}\frac{d\mu(\lambda)}{1+\lambda^{2}}<\infty.     Conversely, every function of this form turns out to be a Nevanlinna function. The constants in this representation are related to the function N via       C  =    Re   (   N   (  i  )    )    and     D  =    lim   y  →  ∞      N   (   i  y   )     i  y         formulae-sequence    C     Re    N  i    and      D    subscript    normal-→  y         N    i  y      i  y        C=\mathrm{Re}(N(i))\qquad\text{and}\qquad D=\lim_{y\rightarrow\infty}\frac{N(%
 iy)}{iy}     and the Borel measure μ can be recovered from N by employing the Stieltjes inversion formula (related to the inversion formula for the Stieltjes transformation ):        μ   (   (   λ  1   ,   λ  2   ]   )    =    lim   δ  →  0      lim   ε  →  0      1  π     ∫    λ  1   +  δ     λ  2   +  δ     Im   (   N   (   λ  +   i  ε    )    )   d  λ        .        μ    subscript  λ  1    subscript  λ  2       subscript    normal-→  δ  0      subscript    normal-→  ε  0        1  π     superscript   subscript      subscript  λ  1   δ       subscript  λ  2   δ      Im    N    λ    i  ε     d  λ         \mu((\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2}])=\lim_{\delta\rightarrow 0}\lim_{\varepsilon%
 \rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\lambda_{1}+\delta}^{\lambda_{2}+\delta}%
 \mathrm{Im}(N(\lambda+i\varepsilon))d\lambda.     A very similar representation of functions is also called the Poisson representation . 1  Examples   Some elementary examples of Nevanlinna functions follow (with appropriately chosen branch cuts in the first three). (   z   z   z   can be replaced by    z  -  a      z  a    z-a   for some real number    a  .    a   a.   )           z  p   with  0   ≤  p  ≤  1           superscript  z  p   with  0   p       1     z^{p}\text{ with }0\leq p\leq 1                -    z  p   with    -  1   ≤  p  ≤  0               superscript  z  p   with    1   p       0     -z^{p}\text{ with }-1\leq p\leq 0          The above examples can also be rotated to some extent around the origin, such as      i    (   z  /  i   )   p   with   -  1   ≤  p  ≤  1.            i   superscript    z  i   p   with   1   p       1.     i(z/i)^{p}\text{ with }-1\leq p\leq 1.              ln   (  z  )       z    \ln(z)              tan   (  z  )       z    \tan(z)   (an example that is not injective )      A Möbius transformation         z  ↦     a  z   +  b     c  z   +  d       maps-to  z        a  z   b       c  z   d      z\mapsto\frac{az+b}{cz+d}         is a Nevanlinna function if (but not only if)      a  ∗   d   -   b   c  ∗           superscript  a  normal-∗   d     b   superscript  c  normal-∗      a^{\ast}d-bc^{\ast}   is a positive real number and     Im   (    b  ∗   d   )    =   Im   (    a  ∗   c   )    =  0.          Im     superscript  b  normal-∗   d      Im     superscript  a  normal-∗   c         0.     \mathrm{Im}(b^{\ast}d)=\mathrm{Im}(a^{\ast}c)=0.   This is equivalent to the set of such transformations that map the real axis to itself. One may then add any constant in the upper half-plane, and move the pole into the lower half-plane, giving new values for the parameters. Example       i  z   +  i   -  2    z  +  1  +  i             i  z   i   2     z  1  i     \frac{iz+i-2}{z+1+i}       If S is a self-adjoint operator in a Hilbert space and f is an arbitrary vector, then the function         ⟨     (   S  -  z   )    -  1    f   ,  f  ⟩        superscript    S  z     1    f   f    \langle(S-z)^{-1}f,f\rangle         is a Nevanlinna function.    If M and N are non-constant Nevanlinna functions, then their composition is a Nevanlinna function as well.
