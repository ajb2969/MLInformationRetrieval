   Field flattener lens      Field flattener lens   Field flattener lens is a type of lens used in modern binocular designs (e.g. Canon 10 x 42 L IS WP, 18 x 50 IS All Weather and Swarovski EL 8.5 x 42, EL 10 x 42) and in astronomic telescopes .  Field flattener lenses in binoculars improve edge sharpness and lower the distortion.  Field flattener lenses counteract the Petzval field curvature of an optical system. In other words, the function of a field flattener lens is to counter the field-angle dependence of the focal length of a system.  The object in designing a field flattening lens is to create a lens that shifts the focal points of the Petzval surface to lie in the same plane. Consider inserting a pane of glass in a focusing beam. Due to refraction, the focal point of the beam is shifted by    δ  x     subscript  δ  x    \delta_{x}   dependent on the thickness of the glass. Thus we have a thickness as a function of focal shift:       t   (   δ  x   )    =    (   n   n  -  1    )    δ  x          t   subscript  δ  x        n    n  1     subscript  δ  x      t(\delta_{x})=\left(\frac{n}{n-1}\right)\delta_{x}   .       δ  x    (  y  )        subscript  δ  x   y    \delta_{x}(y)   is given by the radius of curvature of the Petzval surface,    R  p     subscript  R  p    R_{p}   . It can be shown, then, that the radius of curvature for the lens that would flatten out the field is given by        R  f   =    (    n  -  1   n   )    R  p     .       subscript  R  f         n  1   n    subscript  R  p      R_{f}=\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)R_{p}.    1  See also   Petzval field curvature   References  "  Category:Lenses     ↩
