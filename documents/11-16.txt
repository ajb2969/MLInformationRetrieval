Trimethylamine-oxide aldolase

In enzymology, a trimethylamine-oxide aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

trimethylamine N-oxide 
 
 
 
  dimethylamine + formaldehyde
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, trimethylamine N-oxide, and two products, dimethylamine and formaldehyde.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is trimethylamine-N-oxide formaldehyde-lyase (dimethylamine-forming). Other names in common use include trimethylamine N-oxide formaldehyde-lyase, trimethylamine N-oxide aldolase, trimethylamine N-oxide demethylase, and trimethylamine-N-oxide formaldehyde-lyase. This enzyme participates in methane metabolism.
