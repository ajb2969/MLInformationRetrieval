   Fundamental discriminant      Fundamental discriminant   In mathematics , a fundamental discriminant  D is an integer  invariant in the theory of integral  binary  quadratic forms . If is a quadratic form with integer coefficients, then is the discriminant of Q ( x , y ). Conversely, every integer D with  is the discriminant of some binary quadratic form with integer coefficients. Thus, all such integers are referred to as discriminants in this theory. Every discriminant may be written as   D = D 0 f 2    with D 0 a discriminant and f a positive integer. A discriminant D is called a fundamental discriminant if f = 1 in every such decomposition. Conversely, every discriminant D ≠ 0 can be written uniquely as D 0 f 2 where D 0 is a fundamental discriminant. Thus, fundamental discriminants play a similar role for discriminants as prime numbers do for all integers.  There are explicit congruence conditions that give the set of fundamental discriminants. Specifically, D is a fundamental discriminant if, and only if, one of the following statements holds   D ≡ 1 (mod 4) and is square-free ,  D = 4 m , where m ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 4) and m is square-free.   The first ten positive fundamental discriminants are:   1 , 5 , 8 , 12 , 13 , 17 , 21 , 24 , 28 , 29 , 33 .   The first ten negative fundamental discriminants are:   −3, −4, −7, −8, −11, −15, −19, −20, −23, −24, −31 .   Connection with quadratic fields  There is a connection between the theory of integral binary quadratic forms and the arithmetic of quadratic number fields . A basic property of this connection is that D 0 is a fundamental discriminant if, and only if, D 0 = 1 or D 0 is the discriminant of a quadratic number field. There is exactly one quadratic field for every fundamental discriminant D 0 ≠ 1, up to isomorphism .  Caution : This is the reason why some authors consider 1 not to be a fundamental discriminant. One may interpret D 0 = 1 as the degenerated "quadratic" field Q (the rational numbers ).  Factorization  Fundamental discriminants may also be characterized by their factorization into positive and negative prime powers . Define the set      S  =   {   -  8   ,   -  4   ,  8  ,   -  3   ,  5  ,   -  7   ,   -  11   ,  13  ,  17  ,   -  19   ,  …  }       S     8     4   8    3   5    7     11   13  17    19   normal-…     S=\{-8,-4,8,-3,5,-7,-11,13,17,-19,\;\ldots\}   where the prime numbers ≡ 1 (mod 4) are positive and those ≡ 3 (mod 4) are negative. Then, a number D 0 ≠ 1 is a fundamental discriminant if, and only if, it is the product of pairwise relatively prime members of S .
