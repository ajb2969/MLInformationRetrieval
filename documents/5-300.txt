   Constructive dilemma      Constructive dilemma   Constructive dilemma 1 2 3 is a name of a valid  rule of inference of propositional logic . It is the inference that, if P implies Q and R implies S and either P or R is true, then Q or S has to be true. In sum, if two conditionals are true and at least one of their antecedents is, then at least one of their consequents must be too. Constructive dilemma is the disjunctive version of modus ponens , whereas, destructive dilemma is the disjunctive version of modus tollens . The rule can be stated:        P  →  Q   ,   R  →   S  ,   P  R        ∴   Q  S         formulae-sequence   normal-→  P  Q    normal-→  R   S    P  R       therefore  absent    Q  S      \frac{P\to Q,R\to S,PR}{\therefore QS}     where the rule is that whenever instances of "    P  →  Q     normal-→  P  Q    P\to Q   ", "    R  →  S     normal-→  R  S    R\to S   ", and "    P  R      P  R    PR   " appear on lines of a proof, "    Q  S      Q  S    QS   " can be placed on a subsequent line.  Formal notation  The constructive dilemma rule may be written in sequent notation:       (  P  →  Q  )   ,   (  R  →  S  )   ,   (  P  R  )   ⊢   (  Q  S  )      fragments   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→  Q  normal-)   normal-,   fragments  normal-(  R  normal-→  S  normal-)   normal-,   fragments  normal-(  P  R  normal-)   proves   fragments  normal-(  Q  S  normal-)     (P\to Q),(R\to S),(PR)\vdash(QS)     where   ⊢   proves   \vdash   is a metalogical symbol meaning that    Q  S      Q  S    QS   is a syntactic consequence of    P  →  Q     normal-→  P  Q    P\to Q   ,    R  →  S     normal-→  R  S    R\to S   , and    Q  S      Q  S    QS   in some logical system ;  and expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:       (   (   (  P  →  Q  )   and   (  R  →  S  )   )   and   (  P  R  )   )   →   (  Q  S  )      fragments   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→  Q  normal-)   and   fragments  normal-(  R  normal-→  S  normal-)   normal-)   and   fragments  normal-(  P  R  normal-)   normal-)   normal-→   fragments  normal-(  Q  S  normal-)     (((P\to Q)\and(R\to S))\and(PR))\to(QS)     where   P   P   P   ,   Q   Q   Q   ,   R   R   R   and   S   S   S   are propositions expressed in some formal system .  Variable English  If P then Q. If R then S. P or R. Therefore, Q or S.  Natural language example   If I win a million dollars, I will donate it to an orphanage.  If my friend wins a million dollars, he will donate it to a wildlife fund.  I win a million dollars or my friend wins a million dollars.  Therefore, either an orphanage will get a million dollars, or a wildlife fund will get a million dollars.   The dilemma derives its name because of the transfer of disjunctive operator.
