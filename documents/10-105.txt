   Smart ligand      Smart ligand   Smart ligands are affinity ligands selected with pre-defined equilibrium (    K  d     subscript  K  d    K_{d}   ), kinetic (    k   o  f  f      subscript  k    o  f  f     k_{off}   ,    k   o  n      subscript  k    o  n     k_{on}   ) and thermodynamic (ΔH, ΔS) parameters of biomolecular interaction.  Ligands with desired parameters can be selected from large combinatorial libraries of biopolymers using instrumental separation techniques with well-described kinetic behaviour, such as Kinetic capillary electrophoresis (KCE), Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), Microscale Thermophoresis (MST), 1 2 etc. Known examples of smart ligands include DNA smart aptamers ; however, RNA and peptide smart aptamers can also be developed.  Smart ligands can find a set of unique applications in biomedical research, drug discovery and proteomic studies. For example, a panel of DNA smart aptamers has been recently used to develop affinity analysis of proteins with ultra-wide dynamic range of measured concentrations.
