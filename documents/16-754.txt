Schur class

In mathematics, the Schur class consists of the Schur functions: the holomorphic functions from the open unit disk to the closed unit disk. These functions were studied by .
The Schur parameters γj of a Schur function f0 are defined recursively by
$$\gamma_j=f_j(0)$$
$$zf_{j+1}=\frac{f_j(z)-\gamma_j}{1-\overline{\gamma_j}f_j(z)}.$$
The Schur parameters γj all have absolute value at most 1.
This gives a continued fraction expansion of the Schur function f0 by repeatedly using the fact that
$$f_j(z)=\gamma_j+\frac{1-|\gamma_j|^2}{\overline {\gamma_j}+\frac{1}{zf_{j+1}(z)}}$$ which gives
$$f_0(z)=\gamma_0+\frac{1-|\gamma_0|^2}{\overline {\gamma_0}+\frac{1}{z \gamma_1+\frac{z(1-|\gamma_1|^2)}{\overline {\gamma_1}+\frac{1}{z\gamma_2+\cdots}}}}.$$
