   Four-gradient      Four-gradient   In differential geometry , the four-gradient is the four-vector analogue of the gradient from Gibbs-Heaviside vector calculus .  Definition  The covariant components compactly written in index notation are: 1       ∂   ∂   x  α     =   (   1  c    ∂   ∂  t    ,  ∇  )   =   ∂  α   =     ,  α       fragments        superscript  x  α       fragments  normal-(    1  c        t    normal-,  normal-∇  normal-)     subscript   α      fragments  normal-,  α      \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^{\alpha}}=\left(\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{%
 \partial t},\nabla\right)=\partial_{\alpha}={}_{,\alpha}     The comma in the last part above      ,  α       fragments  normal-,  α     {}_{,\alpha}   implies the partial differentiation with respect to    x  α     superscript  x  α    x^{\alpha}   . This is not the same as a semi-colon, used for the covariant derivative .  The contravariant components are: 2        ∂  α    =    g   α  β     ∂  β    =   (    1  c    ∂   ∂  t     ,   -  ∇   )          superscript   α      superscript  g    α  β     subscript   β              1  c        t       normal-∇       \partial^{\alpha}\ =g^{\alpha\beta}\partial_{\beta}=\left(\frac{1}{c}\frac{%
 \partial}{\partial t},-\nabla\right)     where g αβ is the metric tensor , which here has been chosen for flat spacetime with the metric signature (+,−,−,−).  Alternative symbols to    ∂  α     subscript   α    \partial_{\alpha}   are   □   normal-□   \Box   and D .  Usage  The square of D is the four- Laplacian , which is called the d'Alembert operator :       D  ⋅  D   =    ∂  α    ∂  α    =     1   c  2      ∂  2    ∂   t  2      -   ∇  2           normal-⋅  D  D     subscript   α    superscript   α               1   superscript  c  2       superscript   2      superscript  t  2       superscript  normal-∇  2       D\cdot D=\partial_{\alpha}\partial^{\alpha}=\frac{1}{c^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}}%
 {\partial t^{2}}-\nabla^{2}   .  As it is the dot product of two four-vectors, the d'Alembertian is a Lorentz invariant scalar.  Occasionally, in analogy with the 3-dimensional notation, the symbols   □   normal-□   \Box   and    □  2     superscript  normal-□  2    \Box^{2}   are used for the 4-gradient and d'Alembertian respectively. More commonly however, the symbol   □   normal-□   \Box   is reserved for the d'Alembertian.  Derivation  In 3 dimensions, the gradient operator maps a scalar field to a vector field such that the line integral between any two points in the vector field is equal to the difference between the scalar field at these two points. Based on this, it may appear  incorrectly that the natural extension of the gradient to four dimensions should be:              ∂  α    =   (   ∂   ∂  t    ,  ∇  )        superscript   α         t    normal-∇     \partial^{\alpha}\ =\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t},\nabla\right)       incorrect       However, a line integral involves the application of the vector dot product, and when this is extended to four-dimensional space-time, a change of sign is introduced to either the spatial co-ordinates or the time co-ordinate depending on the convention used. This is due to the non-Euclidean nature of space-time. In this article, we place a negative sign on the spatial co-ordinates. The factor of 1/ c and −1 is to keep the 4-gradient Lorentz covariant. Adding these two corrections to the above expression gives the correct definition of four-gradient:              ∂  α    =   (    1  c    ∂   ∂  t     ,   -  ∇   )        superscript   α        1  c        t       normal-∇      \partial^{\alpha}\ =\left(\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t},-\nabla\right)       correct       See also   Ricci calculus  Index notation  Tensor  Antisymmetric tensor  Einstein notation  Raising and lowering indices  Abstract index notation  Covariance and contravariance of vectors   References   S.
