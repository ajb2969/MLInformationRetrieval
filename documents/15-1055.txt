(Histone-H3)-lysine-36 demethylase

(Histone-H3)-lysine-36 demethylase (, JHDM1A, JmjC domain-containing histone demethylase 1A, H3-K36-specific demethylase, histone-lysine (H3-K36) demethylase, histone demethylase, protein-6-N,6-N-dimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase) is an enzyme with system name protein-N6,N6-dimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

protein N6,N6-dimethyl-L-lysine + 2 2-oxoglutarate + 2 O2

 
  protein L-lysine + 2 succinate + 2 formaldehyde + 2 CO2 (overall reaction)
 
(1a) protein N6,N6-dimethyl-L-lysine + 2-oxoglutarate + O2

 
  protein N6-methyl-L-lysine + succinate + formaldehyde + CO2

(1b) protein N6-methyl-L-lysine + 2-oxoglutarate + O2 
 
 
 
  protein L-lysine + succinate + formaldehyde + CO2


(Histone-H3)-lysine-36 demethylase contains iron(II).
