Folded spectrum method

In mathematics, the folded spectrum method (FSM) is an iterative method for solving large eigenvalue problems. Here you always find a vector with an eigenvalue close to a search-value 
 
 
 
 . This means you can get a vector 
 
 
 
  in the middle of the spectrum without solving the matrix.


 
 , with 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the Identity matrix.
In contrast to the Conjugate gradient method, here the gradient calculates by twice multipling matrix
