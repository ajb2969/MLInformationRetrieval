   Frobenius endomorphism      Frobenius endomorphism   In commutative algebra and field theory , the Frobenius endomorphism (after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius ) is a special endomorphism of commutative  rings with prime characteristic    p   p   p   , an important class which includes finite fields . The endomorphism maps every element to its   p   p   p   -th power. In certain contexts it is an automorphism , but this is not true in general.  Definition  Let   R   R   R   be a commutative ring with prime characteristic   p   p   p   (an integral domain of positive characteristic always has prime characteristic, for example). The Frobenius endomorphism F is defined by       F   (  r  )    =   r  p         F  r    superscript  r  p     F(r)=r^{p}     for all r in R . Clearly this respects the multiplication of R :        F   (   r  s   )    =    (   r  s   )   p   =    r  p    s  p    =   F   (  r  )   F   (  s  )     ,          F    r  s     superscript    r  s   p           superscript  r  p    superscript  s  p           F  r  F  s      F(rs)=(rs)^{p}=r^{p}s^{p}=F(r)F(s)\ ,     and    F   (  1  )       F  1    F(1)   is clearly 1 also. What is interesting, however, is that it also respects the addition of   R   R   R   . The expression can be expanded using the binomial theorem . Because   p   p   p   is prime, it divides    p  !      p    p!   but not any    q  !      q    q!   for      p  !     k  !     (   p  -  k   )   !     ,        p       k       p  k       \frac{p!}{k!(p-k)!},         1  ≤  k  ≤  p  −  1      1  normal-≤  k  normal-≤  p  normal-−  1    1≤k≤p−1     if   p   p   p   . Therefore the coefficients of all the terms except and are divisible by      F   (   r  +  s   )    =    (   r  +  s   )   p   =    r  p   +   s  p    =    F   (  r  )    +   F   (  s  )      .          F    r  s     superscript    r  s   p           superscript  r  p    superscript  s  p             F  r     F  s       F(r+s)=(r+s)^{p}=r^{p}+s^{p}=F(r)+F(s)\ .   , the characteristic, and hence they vanish. 1 Thus      φ  :   R  →  S      normal-:  φ    R  normal-→  S     φ:R→S     This shows that F is a ring homomorphism.  If   p   p   p   is a homomorphism of rings of characteristic      ϕ   (   x  p   )    =   ϕ    (  x  )   p     .        ϕ   superscript  x  p      ϕ   superscript  x  p      \phi(x^{p})=\phi(x)^{p}.   , then:     R   R   R   If and are the Frobenius endomorphisms of   S   S   S   and      ϕ  ∘   F  R    =    F  S   ∘  ϕ    .        ϕ   subscript  F  R       subscript  F  S   ϕ     \phi\circ F_{R}=F_{S}\circ\phi.   , then this can be rewritten as:     p   p   p   This means that the Frobenius endomorphism is a natural transformation from the identity functor on the category of characteristic   R   R   R   rings to itself.  If the ring     F   (  r  )    =  0        F  r   0    F(r)=0   is a ring with no nilpotent elements, then the Frobenius endomorphism is injective:   r   r   r   means 0}} , which by definition means that   p   p   p   is nilpotent of order at most   r   r   r   . In fact, this is an if and only if, because if   p   p   p   is any nilpotent, then one of its powers will be nilpotent of order at most   R   R   R   . In particular, if   R   R   R   is a field then the Frobenius endomorphism is injective.  The Frobenius morphism is not necessarily surjective, even when   p   p   p   is a field. For example let  F p ( t )}} be the finite field of   K   K   K   elements together with a single transcendental element; equivalently,   F   F   F   is the field of rational functions with coefficients in . Then the image of   t   t   t   does not contain      q   (  t  )    /  r    (  t  )           q  t   r   t    q(t)/r(t)   . If it did, then there would be a rational function   p   p   p   whose   t   t   t   -th power would equal   p   p   p   . But the degree of this    p  d  e  g   (  q  )   −  p  d  e  g   (  r  )       p  d  e  g  q  normal-−  p  d  e  g  r    pdeg(q)−pdeg(r)   -th power is   p   p   p   , which is a multiple of   t   t   t   . In particular, it can't be 1, which is the degree of   t   t   t   . This is a contradiction, so   F   F   F   is not in the image of   K   K   K   .  A field   x   x   x   is called perfect if either it is of characteristic zero or if it is of positive characteristic and its Frobenius endomorphism is an automorphism. For example, all finite fields are perfect.  Fixed points of the Frobenius endomorphism  Consider the finite field . By Fermat's little theorem , every element   p   p   p   of satisfies  x }} . Equivalently, it is a root of the polynomial . The elements of therefore determine   p   p   p   roots of this equation, and because this equation has degree   p   p   p   it has no more than   K   K   K   roots over any extension . In particular, if   K   K   K   is an algebraic extension of (such as the algebraic closure or another finite field), then is the fixed field of the Frobenius automorphism of   R   R   R   .  Let    p  >  0      p  0    p>0   be a ring of characteristic   R   R   R   . If   R   R   R   is an integral domain, then by the same reasoning, the fixed points of Frobenius are the elements of the prime field. However, if   p   p   p   is not a domain, then may have more than    𝐅   p  e      subscript  𝐅   superscript  p  e     \mathbf{F}_{p^{e}}   roots; for example, this happens if  F p × F p }} .  A similar property is enjoyed on the finite field    𝐅   p  e      subscript  𝐅   superscript  p  e     \mathbf{F}_{p^{e}}   by the e th iterate of the Frobenius automorphism: Every element of     X   p  e    -  X       superscript  X   superscript  p  e    X    X^{p^{e}}-X   is a root of   K   K   K   , so if    𝐅   p  e      subscript  𝐅   superscript  p  e     \mathbf{F}_{p^{e}}   is an algebraic extension of   F   F   F   and   K   K   K   is the Frobenius automorphism of    𝐅   p  e      subscript  𝐅   superscript  p  e     \mathbf{F}_{p^{e}}   , then the fixed field of is    𝐅   p  e      subscript  𝐅   superscript  p  e     \mathbf{F}_{p^{e}}   . If R is a domain which is an    𝐅   p  e      subscript  𝐅   superscript  p  e     \mathbf{F}_{p^{e}}   -algebra, then the fixed points of the e th iterate of Frobenius are the elements of the image of   R   R   R   .  Iterating the Frobenius map gives a sequence of elements in     x  ,   x  p   ,   x   p  2    ,   x   p  3    ,  …   .     x   superscript  x  p    superscript  x   superscript  p  2     superscript  x   superscript  p  3    normal-…    x,x^{p},x^{p^{2}},x^{p^{3}},\ldots.   :     q   q   q   This sequence of iterates is used in defining the Frobenius closure and the tight closure of an ideal.  As a generator of Galois groups  The Galois group of an extension of finite fields is generated by an iterate of the Frobenius automorphism. First, consider the case where the ground field is the prime field. Let be the finite field of   F   F   F   elements, where  p e }} . The Frobenius automorphism   F   F   F   of fixes the prime field , so it is an element of the Galois group . In fact, this Galois group is cyclic and   F   F   F   is a generator. The order of   e   e   e   is   x   x   x   because acts on an element   F   F   F   by sending it to , and this is the identity on elements of . Every automorphism of is a power of   i   i   i   , and the generators are the powers with   e   e   e   coprime to   F   F   F   .  Now consider the finite field as an extension of . The Frobenius automorphism   e   e   e   of does not fix the ground field , but its   f   f   f   -th iterate does. The Galois group is cyclic of order   i   i   i   and is generated by . It is the subgroup of generated by . The generators of are the powers where   f   f   f   is coprime to     Gal   (     𝐅  q   ¯   /   𝐅  q    )    ,     Gal     normal-¯   subscript  𝐅  q     subscript  𝐅  q      \operatorname{Gal}\left(\overline{\mathbf{F}_{q}}/\mathbf{F}_{q}\right),   .  The Frobenius automorphism is not a generator of the absolute Galois group        𝐙  ^   =     lim  ←   n     𝐙  /  n   𝐙     ,       normal-^  𝐙     subscript  projective-limit  n       𝐙  n   𝐙      \widehat{\mathbf{Z}}=\textstyle\underleftarrow{\lim}_{n}\mathbf{Z}/n\mathbf{Z},     because this Galois group is     X   X   X     which is not cyclic. However, because the Frobenius automorphism is a generator of the Galois group of every finite extension of , it is a generator of every finite quotient of the absolute Galois group. Consequently it is a topological generator in the usual Krull topology on the absolute Galois group.  Frobenius for schemes  There are several different ways to define the Frobenius morphism for a scheme. The most fundamental is the absolute Frobenius morphism. However, the absolute Frobenius morphism behaves poorly in the relative situation because it pays no attention to the base scheme. There are several different ways of adapting the Frobenius morphism to the relative situation, each of which is useful in certain situations.  The absolute Frobenius morphism  Suppose that    p  >  0      p  0    p>0   is a scheme of characteristic    U  =   S  p  e  c  A       U    S  p  e  c  A     U=SpecA   . Choose an open affine subset   X   X   X   of   A   A   A   . The ring   V   V   V   is an -algebra, so it admits a Frobenius endomorphism. If   U   U   U   is an open affine subset of   U   U   U   , then by the naturality of Frobenius, the Frobenius morphism on   V   V   V   , when restricted to   V   V   V   , is the Frobenius morphism on   X   X   X   . Consequently the Frobenius morphism glues to give an endomorphism of   X   X   X   . This endomorphism is called the absolute Frobenius morphism of   X   X   X   . By definition, it is a homeomorphism of   X   X   X   with itself. The absolute Frobenius morphism is a natural transformation from the identity functor on the category of -schemes to itself.  If   S   S   S   is an   S   S   S   -scheme and the Frobenius morphism of   S   S   S   is the identity, then the absolute Frobenius morphism is a morphism of    A  =   𝐅   p  2        A   subscript  𝐅   superscript  p  2      A=\mathbf{F}_{p^{2}}   -schemes. In general, however, it is not. For example, consider the ring   X   X   X   . Let   S   S   S   and    S  p  e  c  A      S  p  e  c  A    SpecA   both equal    X  →  S      X  normal-→  S    X→S   with the structure map   A   A   A   being the identity. The Frobenius morphism on   a   a   a   sends    𝐅   p  2      subscript  𝐅   superscript  p  2     \mathbf{F}_{p^{2}}   to . It is not a morphism of   b   b   b   -algebras. If it were, then multiplying by an element    𝐅   p  2      subscript  𝐅   superscript  p  2     \mathbf{F}_{p^{2}}   in      b  ⋅  a   =   b  a   ≠    F   (  b  )    ⋅  a   =    b  p   a    .         normal-⋅  b  a     b  a         normal-⋅    F  b   a           superscript  b  p   a      b\cdot a=ba\neq F(b)\cdot a=b^{p}a.   would commute with applying the Frobenius endomorphism. But this is not true because:     b   b   b   The former is the action of    𝐅   p  2      subscript  𝐅   superscript  p  2     \mathbf{F}_{p^{2}}   in the   A   A   A   -algebra structure that    𝐅   p  2      subscript  𝐅   superscript  p  2     \mathbf{F}_{p^{2}}   begins with, and the latter is the action of    S  p  e  c  A      S  p  e  c  A    SpecA   induced by Frobenius. Consequently, the Frobenius morphism on    𝐅   p  2      subscript  𝐅   superscript  p  2     \mathbf{F}_{p^{2}}   is not a morphism of   p   p   p   -schemes.  The absolute Frobenius morphism is a purely inseparable morphism of degree   X   X   X   . Its differential is zero. It preserves products, meaning that for any two schemes   Y   Y   Y   and    φ  :   X  →  S      normal-:  φ    X  normal-→  S     φ:X→S   ,  F X × F Y }} .  Restriction and extension of scalars by Frobenius  Suppose that   S   S   S   is the structure morphism for an   X   X   X   -scheme   S   S   S   . The base scheme   φ   φ   φ   has a Frobenius morphism F S . Composing   S   S   S   with F S results in an   S   S   S   -scheme X F called the restriction of scalars by Frobenius . The restriction of scalars is actually a functor, because an    X  →  Y      X  normal-→  Y    X→Y   -morphism   S   S   S   induces an    p  >  0      p  0    p>0   -morphism .  For example, consider a ring A of characteristic     R  =    A   [   X  1   ,  …  ,   X  n   ]    /   (   f  1   ,  …  ,   f  m   )     .      R      A    subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  n       subscript  f  1   normal-…   subscript  f  m       R=A[X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}]/(f_{1},\ldots,f_{m}).   and a finitely presented algebra over A :        c  ⋅   ∑    a  α    X  α      =   ∑   c   a  α    X  α      ,       normal-⋅  c       subscript  a  α    superscript  X  α          c   subscript  a  α    superscript  X  α       c\cdot\sum a_{\alpha}X^{\alpha}=\sum ca_{\alpha}X^{\alpha},   The action of A on R is given by:      X  =   S  p  e  c  R       X    S  p  e  c  R     X=SpecR   where α is a multi-index. Let    S  p  e  c  R      S  p  e  c  R    SpecR   . Then is the affine scheme    S  p  e  c  R  →  S  p  e  c  A      S  p  e  c  R  normal-→  S  p  e  c  A    SpecR→SpecA   , but its structure morphism      c  ⋅   ∑    a  α    X  α      =   ∑   F   (  c  )    a  α    X  α     =   ∑    c  p    a  α    X  α      .         normal-⋅  c       subscript  a  α    superscript  X  α          F  c   subscript  a  α    superscript  X  α               superscript  c  p    subscript  a  α    superscript  X  α        c\cdot\sum a_{\alpha}X^{\alpha}=\sum F(c)a_{\alpha}X^{\alpha}=\sum c^{p}a_{%
 \alpha}X^{\alpha}.   , and hence the action of A on R , is different:     X   X   X     Because restriction of scalars by Frobenius is simply composition, many properties of   X   X   X   are inherited by X F under appropriate hypotheses on the Frobenius morphism. For example, if      X   (  p  )    =   X   ×  S    S  F     .       superscript  X  p     subscript   S   X   subscript  S  F      X^{(p)}=X\times_{S}S_{F}.   and S F are both finite type, then so is X F .  The extension of scalars by Frobenius is defined to be:     S   S   S   The projection onto the   S   S   S   factor makes an   S   S   S   -scheme. If   S   S   S   is not clear from the context, then is denoted by . Like restriction of scalars, extension of scalars is a functor: An    X  →  Y      X  normal-→  Y    X→Y   -morphism   S   S   S   determines an    X  =   S  p  e  c  R       X    S  p  e  c  R     X=SpecR   -morphism .  As before, consider a ring A and a finitely presented algebra R over A , and again let      X   (  p  )    =   Spec   R   ⊗  A    A  F      .       superscript  X  p    Spec    subscript  tensor-product  A   R   subscript  A  F       X^{(p)}=\operatorname{Spec}R\otimes_{A}A_{F}.   . Then:         ∑  i     (    ∑  α     a   i  α     X  α     )   ⊗   b  i     =    ∑  i     ∑  α      X  α   ⊗   a   i  α   p     b  i       ,        subscript   i    tensor-product    subscript   α      subscript  a    i  α     superscript  X  α      subscript  b  i       subscript   i     subscript   α      tensor-product   superscript  X  α    superscript   subscript  a    i  α    p     subscript  b  i        \sum_{i}\left(\sum_{\alpha}a_{i\alpha}X^{\alpha}\right)\otimes b_{i}=\sum_{i}%
 \sum_{\alpha}X^{\alpha}\otimes a_{i\alpha}^{p}b_{i},   A global section of is of the form:        c  ⋅    ∑  i     (    ∑  α     a   i  α     X  α     )   ⊗   b  i      =    ∑  i      (    ∑  α     a   i  α     X  α     )   ⊗   b  i    c     .       normal-⋅  c    subscript   i    tensor-product    subscript   α      subscript  a    i  α     superscript  X  α      subscript  b  i        subscript   i      tensor-product    subscript   α      subscript  a    i  α     superscript  X  α      subscript  b  i    c      c\cdot\sum_{i}\left(\sum_{\alpha}a_{i\alpha}X^{\alpha}\right)\otimes b_{i}=%
 \sum_{i}\left(\sum_{\alpha}a_{i\alpha}X^{\alpha}\right)\otimes b_{i}c.   where α is a multi-index and every a i α and b i is an element of A . The action of an element c of A on this section is:         Spec  A    [   X  1   ,  …  ,   X  n   ]    /   (   f  1   (  p  )    ,  …  ,   f  m   (  p  )    )    ,         Spec  A     subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  n       superscript   subscript  f  1   p   normal-…   superscript   subscript  f  m   p      \operatorname{Spec}A[X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}]/\left(f_{1}^{(p)},\ldots,f_{m}^{(p)}%
 \right),   Consequently, is isomorphic to:        f  j   =    ∑  β     f   j  β     X  β      ,       subscript  f  j     subscript   β      subscript  f    j  β     superscript  X  β       f_{j}=\sum_{\beta}f_{j\beta}X^{\beta},   where, if:        f  j   (  p  )    =    ∑  β     f   j  β   p    X  β      .       superscript   subscript  f  j   p     subscript   β      superscript   subscript  f    j  β    p    superscript  X  β       f_{j}^{(p)}=\sum_{\beta}f_{j\beta}^{p}X^{\beta}.   then:     X   X   X   A similar description holds for arbitrary A -algebras R .  Because extension of scalars is base change, it preserves limits and coproducts. This implies in particular that if    S  ′  →  S      S  normal-′  normal-→  S    S′→S   has an algebraic structure defined in terms of finite limits (such as being a group scheme), then so does . Furthermore, being a base change means that extension of scalars preserves properties such as being of finite type, finite presentation, separated, affine, and so on.  Extension of scalars is well-behaved with respect to base change: Given a morphism       X   (   p  /  S   )     ×  S    S  ′    ≅    (   X   ×  S    S  ′    )    (   p  /   S  ′    )     .        subscript   S    superscript  X    p  S     superscript  S  normal-′     superscript    subscript   S   X   superscript  S  normal-′      p   superscript  S  normal-′       X^{(p/S)}\times_{S}S^{\prime}\cong(X\times_{S}S^{\prime})^{(p/S^{\prime})}.   , there is a natural isomorphism:     S   S   S     Relative Frobenius  The relative Frobenius morphism of an     F   X  /  S    :   X  →   X   (  p  )        normal-:   subscript  F    X  S     normal-→  X   superscript  X  p      F_{X/S}:X\to X^{(p)}   -scheme X is the morphism:        F   X  /  S    =   (   F  X   ,   1  S   )    .       subscript  F    X  S      subscript  F  X    subscript  1  S      F_{X/S}=(F_{X},1_{S}).   defined by:     S   S   S   Because the absolute Frobenius morphism is natural, the relative Frobenius morphism is a morphism of     R  =    A   [   X  1   ,  …  ,   X  n   ]    /   (   f  1   ,  …  ,   f  m   )     .

Consider, for example, the A -algebra:        R   (  p  )    =    A   [   X  1   ,  …  ,   X  n   ]    /   (   f  1   (  p  )    ,  …  ,   f  m   (  p  )    )     .       superscript  R  p       A    subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  n       superscript   subscript  f  1   p   normal-…   superscript   subscript  f  m   p       R^{(p)}=A[X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}]/(f_{1}^{(p)},\ldots,f_{m}^{(p)}).   We have:         ∑  i     ∑  α     X  α   ⊗   a   i  α       ↦    ∑  i     ∑  α     a   i  α     X   p  α        .     maps-to    subscript   i     subscript   α    tensor-product   superscript  X  α    subscript  a    i  α         subscript   i     subscript   α      subscript  a    i  α     superscript  X    p  α         \sum_{i}\sum_{\alpha}X^{\alpha}\otimes a_{i\alpha}\mapsto\sum_{i}\sum_{\alpha}%

The relative Frobenius morphism is the homomorphism defined by:         F   X  /  S    ×   1   S  ′     =   F    X   ×  S    S  ′    /   S  ′      .         subscript  F    X  S     subscript  1   superscript  S  normal-′      subscript  F      subscript   S   X   superscript  S  normal-′     superscript  S  normal-′       F_{X/S}\times 1_{S^{\prime}}=F_{X\times_{S}S^{\prime}/S^{\prime}}.     Relative Frobenius is compatible with base change in the sense that, under the natural isomorphism of and , we have:      X  →  S      X  normal-→  S    X→S     Relative Frobenius is a universal homeomorphism. If    X  →  S      X  normal-→  S    X→S   is an open immersion, then it is the identity. If   S   S   S   is a closed immersion determined by an ideal sheaf I of , then is determined by the ideal sheaf and relative Frobenius is the augmentation map .  X is unramified over   S   S   S   if and only if F X / S is unramified and if and only if F X / S is a monomorphism. X is étale over   S   S   S   if and only if F X / S is étale and if and only if F X / S is an isomorphism.

Again, if:        R   (  p  )    =     A   [   X  1   ,  …  ,   X  n   ]    /   (   f  1   ,  …  ,   f  m   )     ⊗  A    A  F     ,       superscript  R  p     subscript  tensor-product  A       A    subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  n       subscript  f  1   normal-…   subscript  f  m      subscript  A  F      R^{(p)}=A[X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}]/(f_{1},\ldots,f_{m})\otimes_{A}A_{F},            ∑  i     (    ∑  α     a   i  α     X  α     )   ⊗   b  i     ↦    ∑  i     ∑  α     a   i  α     b  i  p    X  α       .     maps-to    subscript   i    tensor-product    subscript   α      subscript  a    i  α     superscript  X  α      subscript  b  i       subscript   i     subscript   α      subscript  a    i  α     superscript   subscript  b  i   p    superscript  X  α        \sum_{i}\left(\sum_{\alpha}a_{i\alpha}X^{\alpha}\right)\otimes b_{i}\mapsto%

 \sum_{i}\sum_{\alpha}a_{i\alpha}b_{i}^{1/p}X^{\alpha}.   by .  Continuing our example of A and R above, geometric Frobenius is defined to be:      {   f  j   (   1  /  p   )    }      superscript   subscript  f  j     1  p      \{f_{j}^{(1/p)}\}   After rewriting R (1/ p ) in terms of      ∑    a  α    X  α     ↦   ∑    a  α   1  /  p     X  α      .     maps-to       subscript  a  α    superscript  X  α          superscript   subscript  a  α     1  p     superscript  X  α       \sum a_{\alpha}X^{\alpha}\mapsto\sum a_{\alpha}^{1/p}X^{\alpha}.   , geometric Frobenius is:     S   S   S     Arithmetic and geometric Frobenius as Galois actions  Suppose that the Frobenius morphism of   S   S   S   is an isomorphism. Then it generates a subgroup of the automorphism of group of    S  =   S  p  e  c  k       S    S  p  e  c  k     S=Speck   . If   X   X   X   is the spectrum of a finite field, then its automorphism group is the Galois group of the field over the prime field, and the Frobenius morphism and its inverse are both generators of the automorphism group. In addition, and may be identified with   X   X   X   . The arithmetic and geometric Frobenius morphisms are then endomorphisms of    X   (  K  )       X  K    X(K)   , and so they lead to an action of the Galois group of k on X .  Consider the set of K -points     𝒪  X   →   k   (  x  )     →  𝐹    k   (  x  )         normal-→   subscript  𝒪  X     k  x      F  normal-→       k  x      \mathcal{O}_{X}\to k(x)\xrightarrow{F}k(x)   . This set comes with a Galois action: Each such point x corresponds to a homomorphism from the structure sheaf to the residue field at x , and the action of Frobenius on x is the application of the Frobenius morphism to the residue field. This Galois action agrees with the action of arithmetic Frobenius: The composite morphism       𝒪  X    →   F   X  /  S   a     𝒪  X   →   k   (  x  )           subscript   superscript  F  a     X  S    normal-→    subscript  𝒪  X    subscript  𝒪  X     normal-→      k  x      \mathcal{O}_{X}\xrightarrow{F^{a}_{X/S}}\mathcal{O}_{X}\to k(x)   is the same as the composite morphism:      L  /  K      L  K    L/K   by the definition of the arithmetic Frobenius. Consequently, arithmetic Frobenius explicitly exhibits the action of the Galois group on points as an endomorphism of X .  Frobenius for local fields  Given an unramified  finite extension     L  /  K      L  K    L/K   of local fields , there is a concept of Frobenius endomorphism which induces the Frobenius endomorphism in the corresponding extension of residue fields . 2  Suppose   K   K   K   is an unramified extension of local fields, with ring of integers  O K of   K   K   K   such that the residue field, the integers of   φ   φ   φ   modulo their unique maximal ideal   q   q   q   , is a finite field of order   Φ   normal-Φ   Φ   . If   L   L   L   is a prime of   φ   φ   φ   lying over    L  /  K      L  K    L/K   , that   L   L   L   is unramified means by definition that the integers of   Φ   normal-Φ   Φ   modulo   L   L   L   , the residue field of   K   K   K   , will be a finite field of order extending the residue field of   f   f   f   where    L  /  K      L  K    L/K   is the degree of   L   L   L   . We may define the Frobenius map for elements of the ring of integers of   L   L   L   as an automorphism of       s  Φ    (  x  )    ≡    x  q   mod  Φ    .         subscript  s  normal-Φ   x    modulo   superscript  x  q   normal-Φ     s_{\Phi}(x)\equiv x^{q}\mod\Phi.   such that      L  /  K      L  K    L/K     Frobenius for global fields  In algebraic number theory , Frobenius elements are defined for extensions   Φ   normal-Φ   Φ   of global fields that are finite Galois extensions for prime ideals    L   L   L   of    L  /  K      L  K    L/K   that are unramified in   Φ   normal-Φ   Φ   . Since the extension is unramified the decomposition group of   L   L   L   is the Galois group of the extension of residue fields. The Frobenius element then can be defined for elements of the ring of integers of       s  Φ    (  x  )    ≡    x  q   mod  Φ    ,         subscript  s  normal-Φ   x    modulo   superscript  x  q   normal-Φ     s_{\Phi}(x)\equiv x^{q}\mod\Phi,   as in the local case, by     q   q   q     where   Φ   normal-Φ   Φ   is the order of the residue field mod    19  ×  151      19  normal-×  151    19×151   .  Lifts of the Frobenius are in correspondence with p-derivations .  Examples  The polynomial      has discriminant      ρ   ρ   ρ   ,   and so is unramified at the prime 3; it is also irreducible mod 3. Hence adjoining a root   3   3   3   of it to the field of   ρ   ρ   ρ   -adic numbers gives an unramified extension of . We may find the image of   ρ   ρ   ρ   under the Frobenius map by locating the root nearest to , which we may do by Newton's method . We obtain an element of the ring of integers in this way; this is a polynomial of degree four in   3   3   3   with coefficients in the     ρ  3   +   3   (    460  +   183  ρ    -   354   ρ  2    -   979   ρ  3    -   575   ρ  4     )         superscript  ρ  3     3      460    183  ρ      354   superscript  ρ  2      979   superscript  ρ  3      575   superscript  ρ  4        \rho^{3}+3(460+183\rho-354\rho^{2}-979\rho^{3}-575\rho^{4})   -adic integers . Modulo this polynomial is     𝐐   𝐐   \mathbf{Q}   .  This is algebraic over   𝐐   𝐐   \mathbf{Q}   and is the correct global Frobenius image in terms of the embedding of   p   p   p   into ; moreover, the coefficients are algebraic and the result can be expressed algebraically. However, they are of degree 120, the order of the Galois group, illustrating the fact that explicit computations are much more easily accomplished if    L  /  K      L  K    L/K   -adic results will suffice.  If   φ   φ   φ   is an abelian extension of global fields, we get a much stronger congruence since it depends only on the prime   K   K   K   in the base field    𝐐   (  β  )       𝐐  β    \mathbf{Q}(β)   . For an example, consider the extension   𝐐   𝐐   \mathbf{Q}   of   β   β   β   obtained by adjoining a root        β  5   +   β  4    -   4   β  3    -   3   β  2     +   3  β   +  1   =  0             superscript  β  5    superscript  β  4      4   superscript  β  3      3   superscript  β  2       3  β   1   0    \beta^{5}+\beta^{4}-4\beta^{3}-3\beta^{2}+3\beta+1=0   satisfying     𝐐   𝐐   \mathbf{Q}     to    2   cos     2  π  n   11         2        2  π  n   11      2\cos\tfrac{2\pi n}{11}   . This extension is cyclic of order five, with roots     n   n   n     for integer   β   β   β   . It has roots which are Chebyshev polynomials of     22  n   +  1        22  n   1    22n+1   :      give the result of the Frobenius map for the primes 2, 3 and 5, and so on for larger primes not equal to 11 or of the form   p   p   p   (which split). It is immediately apparent how the Frobenius map gives a result equal mod   p   p   p   to the   β   β   β   -th power of the root $β$ .
