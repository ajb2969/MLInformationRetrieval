   Draft:K-theory of a category      Draft:K-theory of a category   == Group completion method == The Grothendieck group construction is a functor from the category of rings to the category of abelian groups. The higher K should then be a functor from the category of rings but to the category of higher objects such as simplicial abelian groups . More precise, one define K to be the composition of the following factors: first go from  S-construction  In algebra, the S-construction is a construction in algebraic K-theory that produces a model that can be used to define higher K-groups. It is due to Friedhelm Waldhausen and concerns a category with cofibrations and weak equivalences; such a category is called a Waldhausen category and generalizes Quillen's exact category (cofibrations are admissible monos and weak equivalences isomorphisms.) According to Waldhausen, "S" is for Segal as in Graeme B. Segal . 1  Unlike the Q-construction , which produces a topological space, the S-construction produces a simplicial set .  Details  The arrow category     A  r   (  C  )       A  r  C    Ar(C)   of a category C is a category whose objects are morphisms in C and whose morphisms are squares in C . Let a finite ordered set     [  n  ]   =   {  0  <  1  <  2  <  ⋯  <  n  }      fragments   fragments  normal-[  n  normal-]     fragments  normal-{  0   1   2   normal-⋯   n  normal-}     [n]=\{0<1<2<\cdots   be viewed as a category in the usual way.  Let C be a category with cofibrations and let     S  n   C       subscript  S  n   C    S_{n}C   be a category whose objects are functors    f  :    A  r   [  n  ]    →  C      normal-:  f   normal-→    A  r   delimited-[]  n    C     f:Ar[n]\to C   such that, for    i  ≤  j  ≤  k        i  j       k     i\leq j\leq k   ,    f   (  i  =  i  )   =  *     fragments  f   fragments  normal-(  i   i  normal-)       f(i=i)=*   ,    f   (  i  ≤  j  )   →  f   (  i  ≤  k  )      fragments  f   fragments  normal-(  i   j  normal-)   normal-→  f   fragments  normal-(  i   k  normal-)     f(i\leq j)\to f(i\leq k)   is a cofibration, and    f   (  j  ≤  k  )      fragments  f   fragments  normal-(  j   k  normal-)     f(j\leq k)   is the pushout of    f   (  i  ≤  j  )   →  f   (  i  ≤  k  )      fragments  f   fragments  normal-(  i   j  normal-)   normal-→  f   fragments  normal-(  i   k  normal-)     f(i\leq j)\to f(i\leq k)   and    f   (  i  ≤  j  )   →  f   (  j  =  j  )   =  *     fragments  f   fragments  normal-(  i   j  normal-)   normal-→  f   fragments  normal-(  j   j  normal-)       f(i\leq j)\to f(j=j)=*   . Now, in     S  n   C       subscript  S  n   C    S_{n}C   , define a cofibration to be ... . It is hence a category with cofibrations.  One iterates the construction (take S of     S  n   C       subscript  S  n   C    S_{n}C   ) and then the resulting sequence of multi-simplicial sets       S   (  m  )    C   =   S  ⋯  S  C          superscript  S  m   C     S  normal-⋯  S  C     S^{(m)}C=S\cdots SC   is a spectrum called the K-theory spectrum of C . It is an omega spectrum.  Topological Hochschild homology  Introduced by Bökstedt in 1987 and denoted by THH . A trace map  K → THH relates it with algebraic K-theory .   2  A theorem of 3 guys says that the K-theory of the category of finite sets is a sphere spectrum .  K-theory of a simplicial ring  If R is a constant simplicial ring, then this is the same thing as K -theory of a ring.  See also   Volodin space  Cotriple homology   Notes  References   Bökstedt, M.
