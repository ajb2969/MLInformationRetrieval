Square principle

In mathematical set theory, the global square principle was introduced by Ronald Jensen in his analysis of the fine structure of the constructible universe L. According to Ernest Schimmerling and Martin Zeman, Jensen's square principle and its variants are ubiquitous in set theory.1
Definition
Define Sing to be the class of all limit ordinals which are not regular. Global square states that there is a system 
 
 
 
  satisfying:



 
  is a club set of

If 
 
 
 
  is a limit point of 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 


Variant relative to a cardinal
Jensen introduced also a local version of the principle.2 If 
 
 
 
  is an uncountable cardinal, then 
 
 
 
  asserts that there is a sequence 
 
 
 
  satisfying:



 
  is a club set of

If
