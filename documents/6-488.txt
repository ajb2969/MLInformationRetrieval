   Square principle      Square principle   In mathematical set theory, the global square principle was introduced by Ronald Jensen in his analysis of the fine structure of the constructible universe  L . According to Ernest Schimmerling and Martin Zeman, Jensen's square principle and its variants are ubiquitous in set theory . 1  Definition  Define Sing to be the class of all limit ordinals which are not regular . Global square states that there is a system     (   C  β   )    β  ∈  Sing      subscript   subscript  C  β     β  Sing     (C_{\beta})_{\beta\in\mathrm{Sing}}   satisfying:       C  β     subscript  C  β    C_{\beta}   is a club set of   β   β   \beta   .  ot      (   C  β   )   <  β       subscript  C  β   β    (C_{\beta})<\beta     If   γ   γ   \gamma   is a limit point of    C  β     subscript  C  β    C_{\beta}   then    γ  ∈  Sing      γ  Sing    \gamma\in\mathrm{Sing}   and     C  γ   =    C  β   ∩  γ        subscript  C  γ      subscript  C  β   γ     C_{\gamma}=C_{\beta}\cap\gamma      Variant relative to a cardinal  Jensen introduced also a local version of the principle. 2 If   κ   κ   \kappa   is an uncountable cardinal, then    □  κ     subscript  normal-□  κ    \Box_{\kappa}   asserts that there is a sequence    (   C  β   ∣  β  a limit point of   κ  +   )     fragments  normal-(   subscript  C  β   normal-∣  β  a limit point of   superscript  κ    normal-)    (C_{\beta}\mid\beta\text{ a limit point of }\kappa^{+})   satisfying:       C  β     subscript  C  β    C_{\beta}   is a club set of   β   β   \beta   .  If     c  f  β   <  κ        c  f  β   κ    cf\beta<\kappa   , then     |   C  β   |   <  κ         subscript  C  β    κ    |C_{\beta}|<\kappa     If   γ   γ   \gamma   is a limit point of    C  β     subscript  C  β    C_{\beta}   then     C  γ   =    C  β   ∩  γ        subscript  C  γ      subscript  C  β   γ     C_{\gamma}=C_{\beta}\cap\gamma      Notes  "  Category:Set theory     Ernest Schimmerling and Martin Zeman, Square in Core Models, The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, Volume 7, Number 3, Sept. 2001 ↩  , p. 443. ↩
