   Nicotianamine synthase      Nicotianamine synthase   In enzymology , a nicotianamine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3 S-adenosyl-L-methionine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3 S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine + nicotianamine   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , S-adenosyl-L-methionine , and two products , S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine and nicotianamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:S-adenosyl-L-methionine:S-adenosyl-Lmethioni ne 3-amino-3-carboxypropyltransferase .
