   4-methoxybenzoate monooxygenase (O-demethylating)      4-methoxybenzoate monooxygenase (O-demethylating)   In enzymology , a 4-methoxybenzoate monooxygenase (O-demethylating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-methoxybenzoate + AH 2 + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-hydroxybenzoate + formaldehyde + A + H 2 O   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 4-methoxybenzoate , an electron acceptor AH 2 , and O 2 , whereas its 4 products are 4-hydroxybenzoate , formaldehyde , the reduction product A, and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derive from O miscellaneous. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-methoxybenzoate,hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (O-demethylating) . Other names in common use include 4-methoxybenzoate 4-monooxygenase (O-demethylating) , 4-methoxybenzoate O-demethylase , p-anisic O-demethylase , and piperonylate-4-O-demethylase . This enzyme participates in 2,4-dichlorobenzoate degradation .  References       "  Category:EC 1.14.99  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
