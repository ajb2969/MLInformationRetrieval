   Free independence      Free independence   In the mathematical theory of free probability , the notion of free independence was introduced by Dan Voiculescu . 1 The definition of free independence is parallel to the classical definition of independence , except that the role of Cartesian products of measure spaces (corresponding to tensor products of their function algebras) is played by the notion of a free product of (non-commutative) probability spaces.  In the context of Voiculescu's free probability theory, many classical-probability theorems or phenomena have free probability analogs: the same theorem or phenomenon holds (perhaps with slight modifications) if the classical notion of independence is replaced by free independence. Examples of this include: the free central limit theorem; notions of free convolution ; existence of free stochastic calculus and so on.  Let    (  A  ,  ϕ  )     A  ϕ    (A,\phi)   be a non-commutative probability space , i.e. a unital  algebra    A   A   A   over   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   equipped with a unital  linear functional     ϕ  :   A  →  ℂ      normal-:  ϕ   normal-→  A  ℂ     \phi:A\to\mathbb{C}   . As an example, one could take, for a probability measure   μ   μ   \mu   ,        A  =    L  ∞    (  ℝ  ,  μ  )     ,    ϕ   (  f  )    =   ∫   f   (  t  )   d  μ   (  t  )       .     formulae-sequence    A     superscript  L     ℝ  μ         ϕ  f       f  t  d  μ  t       A=L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R},\mu),\phi(f)=\int f(t)\,d\mu(t).     Another example may be    A  =   M  N       A   subscript  M  N     A=M_{N}   , the algebra of    N  ×  N      N  N    N\times N   matrices with the functional given by the normalized trace    ϕ  =    1  N   T  r       ϕ      1  N   T  r     \phi=\frac{1}{N}Tr   . Even more generally,   A   A   A   could be a von Neumann algebra and   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   a state on   A   A   A   . A final example is the group algebra     A  =   ℂ  Γ       A    ℂ  normal-Γ     A=\mathbb{C}\Gamma   of a (discrete) group    Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   with the functional   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   given by the group trace      ϕ   (  g  )    =   δ   g  =  e     ,   g  ∈  Γ      formulae-sequence      ϕ  g    subscript  δ    g  e       g  normal-Γ     \phi(g)=\delta_{g=e},g\in\Gamma   .  Let    {   A  i   :   i  ∈  I   }     conditional-set   subscript  A  i     i  I     \{A_{i}:i\in I\}   be a family of unital subalgebras of   A   A   A   .  Definition . The family    {   A  i   :   i  ∈  I   }     conditional-set   subscript  A  i     i  I     \{A_{i}:i\in I\}   is called freely independent if     ϕ   (    x  1    x  2   ⋯   x  n    )    =  0        ϕ     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-⋯   subscript  x  n     0    \phi(x_{1}x_{2}\cdots x_{n})=0   whenever     ϕ   (   x  j   )    =  0        ϕ   subscript  x  j    0    \phi(x_{j})=0   ,     x  j   ∈   A   i   (  j  )          subscript  x  j    subscript  A    i  j      x_{j}\in A_{i(j)}   and      i   (  1  )    ≠   i   (  2  )     ,    i   (  2  )    ≠    i   (  3  )    ,  …       formulae-sequence      i  1     i  2        i  2      i  3   normal-…      i(1)\neq i(2),i(2)\neq i(3),\dots   .  If     X  i   ∈  A       subscript  X  i   A    X_{i}\in A   ,    i  ∈  I      i  I    i\in I   is a family of elements of   A   A   A   (these can be thought of as random variables in   A   A   A   ), they are called  freely independent if the algebras    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   generated by   1   1   1   and    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   are freely independent.  Examples of free independence   Let   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   be the free product of groups      Γ  i   ,  i   ∈  I        subscript  normal-Γ  i   i   I    \Gamma_{i},i\in I   , let    A  =   ℂ  Γ       A    ℂ  normal-Γ     A=\mathbb{C}\Gamma   be the group algebra,     ϕ   (  g  )    =   δ   g  =  e          ϕ  g    subscript  δ    g  e      \phi(g)=\delta_{g=e}   be the group trace, and set     A  i   =   ℂ   Γ  i    ⊂  A         subscript  A  i     ℂ   subscript  normal-Γ  i         A     A_{i}=\mathbb{C}\Gamma_{i}\subset A   . Then     A  i   :   i  ∈  I      normal-:   subscript  A  i     i  I     A_{i}:i\in I   are freely independent.    Let        U  i    (  N  )    ,  i   =  1   ,  2     formulae-sequence        subscript  U  i   N   i   1   2    U_{i}(N),i=1,2   be    N  ×  N      N  N    N\times N   unitary random matrices , taken independently at random from the    N  ×  N      N  N    N\times N    unitary group (with respect to the Haar measure ). Then      U  1    (  N  )    ,    U  2    (  N  )          subscript  U  1   N      subscript  U  2   N     U_{1}(N),U_{2}(N)   become asymptotically freely independent as    N  →  ∞     normal-→  N     N\to\infty   . (Asymptotic freeness means that the definition of freeness holds in the limit as    N  →  ∞     normal-→  N     N\to\infty   ).    More generally, independent random matrices tend to be asymptotically freely independent, under certain conditions.
