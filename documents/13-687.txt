   Net operating assets      Net operating assets   Net operating assets (NOA) are a business's operating assets minus its operating liabilities. NOA is calculated by reformatting the balance sheet so that operating activities are separated from financing activities. This is done so that the operating performance of the business can be isolated and valued independently of the financing performance. Financing activities do not create value unless the company is in the finance industry, therefore reformatting the balance sheet allows investors to value just the operating activities and hence get a more accurate valuation of the company.  Calculation       NOA  =   operating assets  -  operating liabilities       NOA    operating assets  operating liabilities     \mathrm{NOA}={\mbox{operating assets}}-{\mbox{operating liabilities}}      In order to calculate NOA the balance sheet must be reformatted in order to separate operating activities from financing activities. Operating activities are anything that involves the day-to-day running of the business such as accounts receivable, inventory, etc.; and financing activities are any accounts that are "interest-bearing" or have financial characteristics and are not related to the regular operations such as debt and equity investments. The reformatted balance sheet should look like this:  Balance  sheet  of  XYZ,  Ltd.  as  of  ...   OPERATING  ACTIVITIES  :   Current  assets  '  –  Current  liabilities '  '  =  Net  current  assets '   +  Non-current  assets    '  –  Non-current  liabilities '  '  =  NET  OPERATING  ASSETS  (NOA) '   FINANCING  ACTIVITIES   Net  financing  obligations  Equity  The basic equation is:       Operating assets  =   total assets  -  cash       Operating assets    total assets  cash     \mbox{Operating assets}=\mbox{total assets}-\mbox{cash}         Operating liabilities  =   total liabilities  -  short-term notes  -  long-term notes       Operating liabilities    total liabilities  short-term notes  long-term notes     \mbox{Operating liabilities}=\mbox{total liabilities}-\mbox{short-term notes}-%
 \mbox{long-term notes}      Application  Calculating NOA is necessary for applying the Discounted Abnormal Operating Earnings valuation model . DAOE is one of the most widely accepted valuation models because it is considered to be the least sensitive to forecast errors. NOA can also be used in the calculation of Free cash flow (FCF) and therefore the Discounted cash flow model. However it is not necessary in order to calculate FCF.       DAOE  =       NOPAT   (  t  )    -    WACC  ×  NOA    (   t  -  1   )     WACC   +  NOA   -  BVD       DAOE            NOPAT  t       WACC  NOA     t  1     WACC   NOA   BVD     \mathrm{DAOE}=\frac{\mbox{NOPAT}(t)-\mbox{WACC}\times\mbox{NOA}(t-1)}{\mbox{%
