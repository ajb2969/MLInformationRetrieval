Silver machine

In set theory, Silver machines are devices used for bypassing the use of fine structure in proofs of statements holding in L. They were invented by set theorist Jack Silver as a means of proving global square holds in the constructible universe.
Preliminaries
An ordinal

 
  is *definable from a class of ordinals X if and only if there is a formula 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is the unique ordinal for which 
 
 
 
  where for all 
 
 
 
  we define 
 
 
 
  to be the name for 
 
 
 
 
  within 
 
 
 
 .
A structure 
 
 
 
  is eligible if and only if:



 
 .
< is the ordering on On restricted to X.


 
  is a partial function from 
 
 
 
 
  to X, for some integer k(i).

If 
 
 
 
  is an eligible structure then 
 
 
 
  is defined to be as before but with all occurrences of X replaced with 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be two eligible structures which have the same function k. Then we say 
 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  we have:



Silver machine
A Silver machine is an eligible structure of the form 
 
 
 
  which satisfies the following conditions:
Condensation principle. If 
 
 
 
 
  then there is an 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
Finiteness principle. For each 
 
 
 
  there is a finite set 
 
 
 
  such that for any set 
 
 
 
 
  we have



Skolem property. If 
 
 
 
  is *definable from the set 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 ; moreover there is an ordinal 
 
 
 
 
 , uniformly 
 
 
 
  definable from 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
 .
