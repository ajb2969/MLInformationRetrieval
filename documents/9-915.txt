Kneser's theorem (differential equations)

In mathematics, in the field of ordinary differential equations, the Kneser theorem, named after Adolf Kneser, provides criteria to decide whether a differential equation is oscillating or not.
Statement of the theorem
Consider an ordinary linear homogeneous differential equation of the form



with



continuous. We say this equation is oscillating if it has a solution y with infinitely many zeros, and non-oscillating otherwise.
The theorem states1 that the equation is non-oscillating if



and oscillating if



Example
To illustrate the theorem consider



where 
 
 
 
  is real and non-zero. According to the theorem, solutions will be oscillating or not depending on whether 
 
 
 
  is positive (non-oscillating) or negative (oscillating) because



To find the solutions for this choice of 
 
 
 
 , and verify the theorem for this example, substitute the 'Ansatz'



which gives



This means that (for non-zero 
 
 
 
 ) the general solution is



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are arbitrary constants.
It is not hard to see that for positive 
 
 
 
  the solutions do not oscillate while for negative 
 
 
 
  the identity



shows that they do.
The general result follows from this example by the Sturm–Picone comparison theorem.
Extensions
There are many extensions to this result. For a recent account see.2
