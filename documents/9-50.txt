3-j symbol

In quantum mechanics, the Wigner 3-j symbols, also called 3j or 3-jm symbols, are related to Clebsch–Gordan coefficients through



Inverse relation
The inverse relation can be found by noting that  is an integer and making the substitution :


 
 . Note that the exponent of the sign factor is always an integer, therefore it remains the same under inversion.
Symmetry properties
The symmetry properties of 3j symbols are more convenient than those of Clebsch–Gordan coefficients. A 3j symbol is invariant under an even permutation of its columns:


 
  An odd permutation of the columns gives a phase factor:


 
  Changing the sign of the 
 
 
 
  quantum numbers also gives a phase:


 
  Regge symmetries also give





 
  Regge symmetries account for a total of 72 symmetries.1 These are best displayed by the definition of a Regge symbol which is a one to one correspondence between it and a 3j symbol and assumes the properties of a semi-magic square2


 
  whereby the 72 symmetries now correspond to 3! row and 3! column interchanges plus a transposition of the matrix. This can be used to devise an effective storage scheme.3
Selection rules
The Wigner 3j is zero unless all these conditions are satisfied:












Scalar invariant
The contraction of the product of three rotational states with a 3j symbol,


 
  is invariant under rotations.
Orthogonality relations






Relation to spherical harmonics
The 3jm symbols give the integral of the products of three spherical harmonics



with 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  integers.
Relation to integrals of spin-weighted spherical harmonics
Similar relations exist for the spin-weighted spherical harmonics:



Recursion relations



Asymptotic expressions
For 
 
 
 
  a non-zero 3-j symbol has

  is a Wigner function. Generally a better approximation obeying the Regge symmetry is given by
