   Asymptotic formula      Asymptotic formula   In mathematics , an asymptotic formula for a quantity (function or expression) depending on natural numbers, or on a variable taking real numbers as values, is a function of natural numbers, or of a real variable, whose values are nearly equal to the values of the former when both are evaluated for the same large values of the variable. An asymptotic formula for a quantity is a function which is asymptotically equivalent to the former.  More generally, an asymptotic formula is "a statement of equality between two functions which is not a true equality but which means the ratio of the two functions approaches 1 as the variable approaches some value, usually infinity". 1  Definition  Let P(n) be a quantity or function depending on n which is a natural number. A function F(n) of n is an asymptotic formula for P(n) if P(n) is asymptotically equivalent to F(n) , that is, if        lim   n  →  ∞      P   (  n  )     F   (  n  )      =  1.        subscript    normal-→  n         P  n     F  n     1.    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{P(n)}{F(n)}=1.     This is symbolically denoted by       P   (  n  )    ∼   F   (  n  )       similar-to    P  n     F  n     P(n)\sim F(n)\,     Examples  Prime number theorem  For a real number x , let π ( x ) denote the number of prime numbers less than or equal to x . The classical prime number theorem gives an asymptotic formula for π ( x ):        π   (  x  )    ∼   x   log   (  x  )      .     similar-to    π  x     x    x      \pi(x)\sim\frac{x}{\log(x)}.     Stirling's formula  (Figure)  Stirling's approximation approaches the factorial function as n increases.   Stirling's approximation is a well-known asymptotic formula for the factorial function:       n  !   =   1  ×  2  ×  …  ×  n         n     1  2  normal-…  n     n!=1\times 2\times\ldots\times n   .  The asymptotic formula is        n  !   ∼     2  π  n      (   n  e   )   n     .     similar-to    n         2  π  n     superscript    n  e   n      n!\sim\sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^{n}.     Asymptotic formula for the partition function  For a positive integer n , the partition function  P ( n ), sometimes also denoted p ( n ), gives the number of ways of writing the integer n as a sum of positive integers, where the order of addends is not considered significant. 2 Thus, for example, P (4) = 5. G.H. Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan in 1918 obtained the following asymptotic formula for P ( n ): 3        P   (  n  )    ∼    1   4  n   3      e   π     2  n   /  3        .     similar-to    P  n       1    4  n    3      superscript  e    π        2  n   3         P(n)\sim\frac{1}{4n\sqrt{3}}e^{\pi\sqrt{2n/3}}.     Asymptotic formula for Airy function  The Airy function Ai(x), which is a solution of the differential equation        y  ′′   -   x  y    =   0          superscript  y  ′′     x  y    0    y^{\prime\prime}-xy=0\,     and which has many applications in physics, has the following asymptotic formula:        Ai   (  x  )    ∼    e   -    2  3    x   3  /  2        2   π    x   1  /  4       .     similar-to    Ai  x      superscript  e        2  3    superscript  x    3  2         2    π    superscript  x    1  4        \mathrm{Ai}(x)\sim\frac{e^{-\frac{2}{3}x^{3/2}}}{2\sqrt{\pi}x^{1/4}}.
