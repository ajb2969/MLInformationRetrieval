Geary's C

Geary's C is a measure of spatial autocorrelation or an attempt to determine if adjacent observations of the same phenomenon are correlated. Spatial autocorrelation is more complex than autocorrelation because the correlation is multi-dimensional and bi-directional.
Geary's C is defined as



where 
 
 
 
  is the number of spatial units indexed by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ; 
 
 
 
  is the variable of interest; 
 
 
 
  is the mean of 
 
 
 
 ; 
 
 
 
  is a matrix of spatial weights; and 
 
 
 
  is the sum of all 
 
 
 
 .
The value of Geary's C lies between 0 and 2. 1 means no spatial autocorrelation. Values lower than 1 demonstrate increasing positive spatial autocorrelation, whilst values higher than 1 illustrate increasing negative spatial autocorrelation.
Geary's C is inversely related to Moran's I, but it is not identical. Moran's I is a measure of global spatial autocorrelation, while Geary's C is more sensitive to local spatial autocorrelation.
Geary's C is also known as Geary's contiguity ratio or simply Geary's ratio.1
This statistic was developed by Roy C. Geary.2
