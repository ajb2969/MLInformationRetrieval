   Geary's C      Geary's C   Geary's C is a measure of spatial autocorrelation or an attempt to determine if adjacent observations of the same phenomenon are correlated. Spatial autocorrelation is more complex than autocorrelation because the correlation is multi-dimensional and bi-directional.  Geary's C is defined as      C  =     (   N  -  1   )     ∑  i     ∑  j     w   i  j      (    X  i   -   X  j    )   2        2  W    ∑  i     (    X  i   -   X  ¯    )   2          C        N  1     subscript   i     subscript   j      subscript  w    i  j     superscript     subscript  X  i    subscript  X  j    2         2  W    subscript   i    superscript     subscript  X  i    normal-¯  X    2        C=\frac{(N-1)\sum_{i}\sum_{j}w_{ij}(X_{i}-X_{j})^{2}}{2W\sum_{i}(X_{i}-\bar{X}%
 )^{2}}     where   N   N   N   is the number of spatial units indexed by   i   i   i   and   j   j   j   ;   X   X   X   is the variable of interest;    X  ¯     normal-¯  X    \bar{X}   is the mean of   X   X   X   ;    w   i  j      subscript  w    i  j     w_{ij}   is a matrix of spatial weights; and   W   W   W   is the sum of all    w   i  j      subscript  w    i  j     w_{ij}   .  The value of Geary's C lies between 0 and 2. 1 means no spatial autocorrelation. Values lower than 1 demonstrate increasing positive spatial autocorrelation, whilst values higher than 1 illustrate increasing negative spatial autocorrelation.  Geary's C is inversely related to Moran's I , but it is not identical. Moran's I is a measure of global spatial autocorrelation, while Geary's C is more sensitive to local spatial autocorrelation.  Geary's C is also known as Geary's contiguity ratio or simply Geary's ratio. 1  This statistic was developed by Roy C.
