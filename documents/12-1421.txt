   Western non-interpolations      Western non-interpolations   Western non-interpolations are readings in the Western text-type that are shorter than those of other New Testament text types . The term was coined by F. J. A. Hort . 1 The Alexandrian text is generally terse; the Western text is enlarged and paraphrased at places; the Byzantine text is a combination of the two. Nevertheless, the Western text is in certain places shorter than the Alexandrian text. All these shorter readings Hort named western non-interpolations . Since the 18th century, scholars have preferred the shorter reading . It was the authentic text according to B. F. Westcott and F. J. A. Hort. When they printed The New Testament in the Original Greek (1882), in almost all cases, it followed the Alexandrian text with a few exceptions — including Western non-interpolations. According to Westcott and Hort, on some rare occasions Western textual witnesses have preserved the original text, against all other witnesses. 2  Commonly accepted Western non-interpolations   Matthew 27:49 – ἄλλος δὲ λαβὼν λόγχην ἒνυξεν αὐτοῦ τὴν πλευράν, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὖδορ καὶ αἳμα ( the other took a spear and pierced His side, and immediately came out water and blood ), this reading was derived from John 19:34 – is found in א , B , C , L , U , Γ , 1010, 1293, syr pal , eth mss , but is omitted by all other texts, including A , D , E , F , G , H , K , M , S , W , Δ , Θ , Σ , 090 , Byz , it , vg, syr cur , cop sa , cop bo , arm, geo); it was omitted also in late witness of the Alexandrian text-type in Minuscule 892  Luke 22:19b-20 – τὸ ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν διδόμενον... τὸ ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν ἐκχυννόμενον ( which is given for you... which is shed for you ), omitted by D, a, (b, e have a different word order) d, ff 2 , i , l (syr cur omits only verse 20)  Luke 24:3 – τοῦ κυρίου Ἰησοῦ ( of the Lord Jesus ), omitted by D, a , b , d , e , ff 2 , l, r 1 , ( 579 , 1071 , 1241 , syr cur have του Ιησου but omit κυριου)  Luke 24:6 – οὐκ ἔστιν ὢδε, ἀλλ(ὰ) ἠγέρθη ( He is not here, but is risen! ), omitted by D, a, b, d, e, ff 2 , l, r 1 , arm mss , geo B  Luke 24:12 – entire verse omitted by D, a, b, d, e, l, r 1  Luke 24:36 – καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς εἰρήνη ὑμῖν ( and said to them: Peace to you ), omitted by D, a, b, d, e, ff 2 , l, r 1  Luke 24:40 – καὶ τοῦτο εἰπὼν ἔδειξεν αὐτοῖς τὰς χειρᾶς καὶ τοὺς πόδας ( and when He said this, He showed them His hands and His feet ), omitted by D, a, b, d, e, ff 2 , l, r 1 , syr sin , syr cur  Luke 24:51 – καὶ ἀνεφέρετο εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν ( and carried up into heaven ), omitted by א *, D, a, b, d, e, ff 2 , l, (hiat r 1 ), sin ( syr cur ) geo 1  Luke 24:52 – προσκυνήσαντες αὐτὸν ( worshiped Him ), omitted by D, a, b, d, e, ff 2 , l (hiat r 1 ), sin (syr cur ), geo 2   Other possible Western non-interpolations   Matt. 6:15 – τὰ παραπτώματα αὐτῶν ( their trespasses ), omitted by א D 1 - 118 - 205 - 209 -1582, 22 , 892*, a , aur , c , ff 1 , g 1 , syr h  Matt. 9:34 – οἱ δὲ Φαρισαῖοι ἔλεγον ἐν τᾡ ἂρχωντι τῶν δαιμονίων ἐκβάλλει τὰ δαιμόνια ( But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons ), omitted by D, a, d, k , sin, Hilary (hiat e syr cur )  Matt. 13:33 – ἐλάλησεν αὐτοῖς omitted by D, d, (k), sin, syr cur  Matt. 21:44 – entire verse omitted by    𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    104 , D, 33 , a, b, d, e, ff 1 , ff 2 , r 1 , syr sin , Irenaeus (lat), Origen  Matt. 23:26 – καὶ τῆς παροψίδος ( and dish ), found in: B, C, L, W , 33 , Byz, cop; but omitted by D , Q , 1 - 118 -209-1582, 700 , a, d, e, ff 1 , r 1 , sin, geo, Irenaeus lat , Clement (hiat, b, syr cur )  Mark 10:2 – προσελθοντες Φαρισαιοι ( the Pharisees came ), or προσελθοντες οι Φαρισαιοι (word order varies), omitted by D, a, b, d, k, r 1 , syr sin (syr cur )  Mark 14:39 – τὸν αὐτὸν λόγον εἰπών ( spoke the same words ), omitted by D, a, b, c, d, ff 2 , k, (syr cur )  Luke 5:39 – entire verse omitted by D, a, b, c, d, e, ff 2 , l, r 1 (syr sin syr cur )  Luke 10:41-42 – instead μεριμνας και θορυβαζη περι πολλα, ολιγων (ενος) δε εστιν χρεια Μαριαμ γαρ ( you are worried and troubled about many things, but not much (one thing) is needed ) has only θορυβαζη ( worried ) with (D has Μαριαμ) (a, b, d, e, ff 2 , i, l, r 1 , syr sin , Ambrose omit θορυβαζη)  Luke 12:21 – entire verse omitted by D, a, b, d  Luke 22:62 – entire verse omitted by ( 0171 does not appear to leave space) a, b, e, ff 2 , i, l, r 1  Luke 24:9 – απο του μνημειου ( from the tomb ), omitted by D, a, b, c, d, e, ff 2 , l, r 1 , arm, geo  John 4:9 – ου γαρ συγχρωνται Ιουδαιοι Σαμαριταις ( Jews have no dealings with Samaritans ), omitted by א*, D, a, b, d, e , j , cop fay   Outside the Gospels   Rom. 6:16 – εις θανατον ( for death ) omitted by D, 1739 *, d, r, am, pesh, sa, arm mss , Ambrosiaster  Rom. 10:21 – και αντιλεγοντα ( and contrary ), omitted by F, G, g, Ambrosiaster, Hilary  Rom. 16:20 – η χαρις του κυριου ημων Ιησου (Χριστου) μεθ υμων omitted ( The grace of our Lord Jesus (Christ) with you ), by D* vid , F , G , d, f , g , m , bodl  Ambrosiaster  Pelagius ms  Rom. 16:25-27 – verses omitted by F, G, 629 , d**?, g, goth?, Jerome mss  1 Cor. 15:3 – ο και παρελαβον ( I received ), omitted by b, Ambrosiaster, Irenaeus lat , Tertullian?  1 Cor. 15:15 – ειπερ αρα νεκροι ουκ εγειρονται ( if in fact the dead do not rise ), omitted by D, a, b, r, bam, ful**, harl*, kar, mon, reg, val*, pesh, Ambrosiaster , Irenaeus (lat), Tertullian ?  2 Cor. 10:12-13 – ου συνιασιν. ημεις δε omitted ( are not wise.

The editions of Nestle and Nestle-Aland did the same. In 1968, "the editorial committee (or more precisely its majority) decided to abandon the theories of Westcott-Hort and the Western non-interpolations." 3 Since 1968 they are included in the main text, but marked with brackets.
