Conservativity theorem

In mathematical logic, the conservativity theorem states the following: Suppose that a closed formula



is a theorem of a first-order theory

 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be a theory obtained from 
 
 
 
  by extending its language with new constants



and adding a new axiom


 
 .
Then 
 
 
 
  is a conservative extension of 
 
 
 
 , which means that the theory 
 
 
 
  has the same set of theorems in the original language (i.e., without constants 
 
 
 
 ) as the theory 
 
 
 
 .
In a more general setting, the conservativity theorem is formulated for extensions of a first-order theory by introducing a new functional symbol:

Suppose that a closed formula 
 
 
 
  is a theorem of a first-order theory 
 
 
 
 , where we denote 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be a theory obtained from 
 
 
 
  by extending its language with new functional symbol 
 
 
 
  (of arity 
 
 
 
 ) and adding a new axiom 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is a conservative extension of 
 
 
 
 , i.e. the theories 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  prove the same theorems not involving the functional symbol 
 
 
 
 ).
