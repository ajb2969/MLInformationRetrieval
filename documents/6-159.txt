   Conservativity theorem      Conservativity theorem   In mathematical logic , the conservativity theorem states the following: Suppose that a closed formula      ∃    x  1   …   ∃     x  m    φ   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  m   )             subscript  x  1   normal-…       subscript  x  m   φ    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  m         \exists x_{1}\ldots\exists x_{m}\,\varphi(x_{1},\ldots,x_{m})     is a theorem of a first-order theory    T   T   T   . Let    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   be a theory obtained from   T   T   T   by extending its language with new constants       a  1   ,  …  ,   a  m       subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  m     a_{1},\ldots,a_{m}     and adding a new axiom      φ   (   a  1   ,  …  ,   a  m   )       φ    subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  m      \varphi(a_{1},\ldots,a_{m})   .  Then    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   is a conservative extension of   T   T   T   , which means that the theory    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   has the same set of theorems in the original language (i.e., without constants    a  i     subscript  a  i    a_{i}\,\!   ) as the theory   T   T   T   .  In a more general setting, the conservativity theorem is formulated for extensions of a first-order theory by introducing a new functional symbol :   Suppose that a closed formula    ∀     y  →     ∃    x   φ   (  x  ,   y  →   )         for-all     normal-→  y       x  φ   x   normal-→  y         \forall\vec{y}\,\exists x\,\!\,\varphi(x,\vec{y})   is a theorem of a first-order theory   T   T   T   , where we denote     y  →   :=   (   y  1   ,  …  ,   y  n   )      assign   normal-→  y     subscript  y  1   normal-…   subscript  y  n      \vec{y}:=(y_{1},\ldots,y_{n})   . Let    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   be a theory obtained from   T   T   T   by extending its language with new functional symbol   f   f   f\,\!   (of arity   n   n   n   ) and adding a new axiom    ∀     y  →    φ   (   f   (   y  →   )    ,   y  →   )       for-all     normal-→  y   φ     f   normal-→  y     normal-→  y       \forall\vec{y}\,\varphi(f(\vec{y}),\vec{y})   . Then    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   is a conservative extension of   T   T   T   , i.e. the theories   T   T   T   and    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   prove the same theorems not involving the functional symbol   f   f   f\,\!   ).
