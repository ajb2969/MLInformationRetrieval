   N-acetyllactosaminide 3-alpha-galactosyltransferase      N-acetyllactosaminide 3-alpha-galactosyltransferase   In enzymology , a N-acetyllactosaminide 3-alpha-galactosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-galactose + beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-R   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-N- acetylglucosaminyl-R   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-galactose and beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-R , whereas its 3 products are UDP , alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-N- , and acetylglucosaminyl-R .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-galactose:N-acetyllactosaminide 3-alpha-D-galactosyltransferase . Other names in common use include alpha-galactosyltransferase , UDP-Gal:beta-D-Gal(1,4)-D-GlcNAc alpha(1,3)-galactosyltransferase , UDP-Gal:N-acetyllactosaminide alpha(1,3)-galactosyltransferase , UDP-Gal:N-acetyllactosaminide alpha-1,3-D-galactosyltransferase , UDP-Gal:Galbeta1->4GlcNAc-R alpha1->3-galactosyltransferase , UDP-galactose-acetyllactosamine alpha-D-galactosyltransferase , UDPgalactose:beta-D-galactosyl-beta-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl- , glycopeptide alpha-1,3-D-galactosyltransferase , glucosaminylglycopeptide alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase , uridine diphosphogalactose-acetyllactosamine , alpha1->3-galactosyltransferase , uridine diphosphogalactose-acetyllactosamine galactosyltransferase , uridine , diphosphogalactose- , galactosylacetylglucosaminylgalactosylglucosylceramide , galactosyltransferase , beta-D-galactosyl-N-acetylglucosaminylglycopeptide , and alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - lactoseries , glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - neo-lactoseries , and glycan structures - biosynthesis 2 .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
