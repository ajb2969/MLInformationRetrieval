24 (number)

24 (twenty-four) is the natural number following 23 and preceding 25.
The SI prefix for 1024 is yotta (Y), and for 10−24 (i.e., the reciprocal of 1024) yocto (y). These numbers are the largest and smallest number to receive an SI prefix to date.
In mathematics

24 is the factorial of 4 (24 = 4!) and a composite number, being the first number of the form 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is an odd prime.
Since 24 = 4!, it follows that 24 is the number of ways to order 4 distinct items: (1,2,3,4), (1,2,4,3), (1,3,2,4,), (1,3,4,2), (1,4,2,3), (1,4,3,2), (2,1,3,4,), (2,1,4,3), (2,3,1,4,), (2,3,4,1), (2,4,1,3), (2,4,3,1), (3,1,2,4), (3,1,4,2), (3,2,1,4), (3,2,4,1), (3,4,1,2), (3,4,2,1), (4,1,2,3), (4,1,3,2), (4,2,1,3), (4,2,3,1), (4,3,1,2), (4,3,2,1).
It is the smallest number with exactly eight divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.
It is a highly composite number, having more divisors than any smaller number.
24 is a semiperfect number, since adding up all the proper divisors of 24 except 4 and 8 gives 24.
Subtracting 1 from any of its divisors (except 1 and 2, but including itself) yields a prime number; 24 is the largest number with this property.
24 has an aliquot sum of 36 and the aliquot sequence (24, 36, 55, 17, 1, 0). It is therefore the lowest abundant number whose aliquot sum is itself abundant.
The aliquot sum of only one number, 529 = 232, is 24.
There are 10 solutions to the equation φ(x) = 24, namely 35, 39, 45, 52, 56, 70, 72, 78, 84 and 90. This is more than any integer below 24, making 24 a highly totient number.
24 is a nonagonal number.
24 is the sum of the prime twins 11 and 13.
24 is a Harshad number.
24 is a semi-meandric number.
The product of any four consecutive numbers is divisible by 24. This is because among any four consecutive numbers there must be two even numbers, one of which is a multiple of four, and there must be a multiple of three.
The tesseract has 24 two-dimensional faces (which are all squares).
24 is the only nontrivial solution to the cannonball problem, that is: 12+22+32+...+242 is a perfect square (=702). (The trivial case is just 12 = 12.)
In 24 dimensions there are 24 even positive definite unimodular lattices, called the Niemeier lattices. One of these is the exceptional Leech lattice which has many surprising properties; due to its existence, the answers to many problems such as the kissing number problem and densest lattice sphere-packing problem are known in 24 dimensions but not in many lower dimensions. The Leech lattice is closely related to the equally nice length-24 binary Golay code and the Steiner system S(5,8,24) and the Mathieu group M24. (One construction of the Leech lattice is possible because 12+22+32+...+242 =702.)
The modular discriminant Δ(τ) is proportional to the 24th power of the Dedekind eta function η(τ):       Δ(τ) = (2π)12η(τ)24.
The Barnes-Wall lattice contains 24 lattices.
24 is the only number whose divisors — namely, {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24} — are exactly those numbers n for which every invertible element of the commutative ring Z/nZ is a square root of 1. It follows that the multiplicative group (Z/24Z)× = {±1, ±5, ±7, ±11} is isomorphic to the additive group (Z/2Z)3. This fact plays a role in monstrous moonshine.
 
It follows that any number n relatively prime to 24, and in particular any prime n greater than 3, has the property that n2-1 is divisible by 24.
 

The 24-cell, with 24 octahedral cells and 24 vertices, is a self-dual convex regular 4-polytope; it has no analogue in any other dimension. Its 24 vertices can be expressed as the set {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k, (±1 ± i ± j ± k)/2} of unit quaternions, using all choices of signs. This set forms a group under quaternion multiplication, isomorphic to the binary tetrahedral group. The quotient of the unit quaternions S3 by this subgroup is identical as a metric space to the configuration space of a regular tetrahedron centered at the origin in 3-space. The 24-cell tiles 4-dimensional space.
24 is the kissing number in 4-dimensional space: the maximum number of unit spheres that can all touch another unit sphere without overlapping. (The centers of 24 such spheres form the vertices of a 24-cell.)
24 is the second Granville number, the previous being 6 and the next being 28. It is the first Granville number that is not also a conventional perfect number.
24 is the largest integer that is evenly divisible by all natural numbers no larger than its square root.
24 is the Euler characteristic of a K3 surface

The number was reissued to Griffey when he rejoined the team in 2009, and taken out of circulation again after his retirement during the 2010 season.
