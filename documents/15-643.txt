   Rulkov map      Rulkov map   (Figure)  Time series of Rulkov map showing three different dynamical regimes   The Rulkov map is a two-dimensional iterated map used to model a biological neuron . It was proposed by Nikolai F. Rulkov in 2001. 1 The use of this map to study neural networks has computational advantages because the map is easier to iterate than a continuous dynamical system . This saves memory and simplifies the computation of large neural networks.  The model  The Rulkov map, with   n   n   n   as discrete time, can be represented by following dynamical equations:       x   n  +  1    =    α   1  +   x  n  2     +   y  n         subscript  x    n  1        α    1   superscript   subscript  x  n   2      subscript  y  n      x_{n+1}=\frac{\alpha}{1+x_{n}^{2}}+y_{n}          y   n  +  1    =    y  n   -   μ   (    x  n   -  σ   )          subscript  y    n  1       subscript  y  n     μ     subscript  x  n   σ       y_{n+1}=y_{n}-\mu(x_{n}-\sigma)     where   x   x   x   represents the membrane potential of the neuron. The variable   y   y   y   in the model is a slow variable due to very small value of parameter   μ   μ   \mu       (   0  <  μ  ≪  1   )        0  μ    much-less-than    1     (0<\mu<<1)   . Unlike variable   x   x   x   , variable   y   y   y   does not have explicit biological meaning though some analogy to gating variables can be drawn. 2 The parameter   σ   σ   \sigma   can be thought of as an external dc current given to the neuron and   α   α   \alpha   is a nonlinearity parameter of the map. Different combinations of parameters   σ   σ   \sigma   and   α   α   \alpha   give rise to different dynamical states of the neuron like resting, tonic spiking and chaotic bursts . The chaotic bursting is enabled above    α  >  4      α  4    \alpha>4     Analysis  The dynamics of the Rulkov map can be analyzed by analyzing the dynamics of its one dimensional fast submap. Since the variable   y   y   y   evolves very slowly, for moderate amount of time it can be treated as a paramter with constant value in the   x   x   x   variable's evolution equation (which we now call as one dimensional fast submap because as compared to   y   y   y   ,   x   x   x   is a fast variable). Depending on the value of   y   y   y   , this submap can have either one or three fixed points. One of these fixed points is stable, another is unstable and third may change the stability. 3 As   y   y   y   increases, two of these fixed points (stable one and unstable one) merge together and disappear by saddle-node bifurcation .
