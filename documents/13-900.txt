Mechanical similarity

Let us consider a system of particles and assume that the interaction energy between any couple of particles has the form 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the distance between the two particles. In such a case the equations of motion permit a series of geometrically similar paths, and the times of motion 
 
 
 
  at corresponding points on the paths are related to the linear size 
 
 
 
  of the path by



Examples

The period of small oscillations (
 
 
 
 ) is independent of their amplitude.
The time of free fall under gravity (
 
 
 
 ) is proportional to the square root of the initial altitude.
The square of the time of revolution of the planets (
 
 
 
 ) is proportional to the cube of the orbital size.
