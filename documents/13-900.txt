   Mechanical similarity      Mechanical similarity   Let us consider a system of particles and assume that the interaction energy between any couple of particles has the form     U   (  r  )    ∝   r  k      proportional-to    U  r    superscript  r  k     U(r)\propto r^{k}   , where   r   r   r   is the distance between the two particles. In such a case the equations of motion permit a series of geometrically similar paths, and the times of motion   t   t   t   at corresponding points on the paths are related to the linear size   l   l   l   of the path by       t  ∝   l   1  -   k  /  2      .     proportional-to  t   superscript  l    1    k  2       t\propto l^{1-k/2}.     Examples   The period of small oscillations (    k  =  2      k  2    k=2   ) is independent of their amplitude.  The time of free fall under gravity (    k  =  1      k  1    k=1   ) is proportional to the square root of the initial altitude.  The square of the time of revolution of the planets (    k  =   -  1       k    1     k=-1   ) is proportional to the cube of the orbital size.
