   Weakly harmonic function      Weakly harmonic function   In mathematics , a function   f   f   f   is weakly harmonic in a domain   D   D   D   if        ∫  D     f   Δ  g    =  0        subscript   D     f  normal-Δ  g    0    \int_{D}f\,\Delta g=0     for all   g   g   g   with compact support in   D   D   D   and continuous second derivatives, where Δ is the Laplacian . This is the same notion as a weak derivative , however, a function can have a weak derivative and not be differentiable. In this case, we have the somewhat surprising result that a function is weakly harmonic if and only if it is harmonic. Thus weakly harmonic is actually equivalent to the seemingly stronger harmonic condition.  See also   Weak solution  Weyl's lemma   "  Category:Harmonic functions
