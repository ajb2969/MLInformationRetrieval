Weakly harmonic function

In mathematics, a function 
 
 
 
  is weakly harmonic in a domain 
 
 
 
  if



for all 
 
 
 
 
  with compact support in 
 
 
 
  and continuous second derivatives, where Î” is the Laplacian. This is the same notion as a weak derivative, however, a function can have a weak derivative and not be differentiable. In this case, we have the somewhat surprising result that a function is weakly harmonic if and only if it is harmonic. Thus weakly harmonic is actually equivalent to the seemingly stronger harmonic condition.
