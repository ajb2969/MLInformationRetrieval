Real hyperelliptic curve

A hyperelliptic curve is a class of algebraic curves. Hyperelliptic curves exist for every genus

 
 . The general formula of Hyperelliptic curve over a finite field 
 
 
 
  is given by



where 
 
 
 
  satisfy certain conditions. There are two types of hyperelliptic curves: real hyperelliptic curves and imaginary hyperelliptic curves which differ by the number of points at infinity. In this page, we describe more about real hyperelliptic curves, these are curves having two points at infinity while imaginary hyperelliptic curves have one point at infinity.
Definition
A real hyperelliptic curve of genus g over K is defined by an equation of the form 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  has degree not larger than g+1 while 
 
 
 
  must have degree 2g+1 or 2g+2. This curve is a non singular curve where no point 
 
 
 
  in the algebraic closure of 
 
 
 
  satisfies the curve equation 
 
 
 
  and both partial derivative equations
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The set of (finite) 
 
 
 
 –rational points on C is given by



Where 
 
 
 
  is the set of points at infinity. For real hyperelliptic curves, there are two points at infinity, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . For any point 
 
 
 
 , the opposite point of 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 ; it is the other point with x-coordinate a that also lies on the curve.
Example
Let 
 
 
 
  where



over 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  has degree 6, thus 
 
 
 
  is a curve of genus g = 2.
The homogeneous version of the curve equation is given by


 
 . It has a single point at infinity given by (0:1:0) but this point is singular. The blowup of 
 
 
 
  has 2 different points at infinity, which we denote 
 
 
 
 and 
 
 
 
 . Hence this curve is an example of a real hyperelliptic curve.
In general, every curve given by an equation where f has even degee has two points at infinity and is a real hyperelliptic curve while those where f has odd degree have only a single point in the blowup over (0:1:0) and are thus imaginary hyperelliptic curves. In both cases this assumes that the affine part of the curve is nonsingular (see the conditions on the derivatives above)
Arithmetic in a real hyperelliptic curve
In real hyperelliptic curve, addition is no longer defined on points as in elliptic curves but on divisors and the Jacobian. Let 
 
 
 
  be a hyperelliptic curve of genus g over a finite field K. A divisor 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  is a formal finite sum of points 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 . We write


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for almost all 
 
 
 
 .
The degree of 
 
 
 
  is defined by


 
  . 
 
 
 
  is said to be defined over 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  for all automorphisms σ of 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  . The set 
 
 
 
  of divisors of 
 
 
 
  defined over 
 
 
 
  forms an additive abelian group under the addition rule


 
 .
The set 
 
 
 
  of all degree zero divisors of 
 
 
 
  defined over 
 
 
 
  is a subgroup of 
 
 
 
 .
We take an example:
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . If we add them then 
 
 
 
 . The degree of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  and the degree of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . Then, 
 
 

For polynomials 
 
 
 
 , the divisor of 
 
 
 
  is defined by


 
 . If the function 
 
 
 
  has a pole at a point 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is the order of vanishing of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 . Assume 
 
 
 
  are polynomials in 
 
 
 
 ; the divisor of the rational function 
 
 
 
  is called a principal divisor and is defined by 
 
 
 
 . We denote the group of principal divisors by 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
 . The Jacobian of 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  is defined by 
 
 
 
 . The factor group 
 
 
 
  is also called the divisor class group of 
 
 
 
 . The elements which are defined over 
 
 
 
  form the group 
 
 
 
 . We denote by 
 
 
 
  the class of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
There are two canonical ways of representing divisor classes for real hyperelliptic curves 
 
 
 
  which have two points infinity 
 
 
 
 . The first one is to represent a degree zero divisor by 
 
 
 
 such that 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 ,
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  The representative 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is then called semi reduced. If 
 
 
 
  satisfies the additional condition 
 
 
 
  then the representative 
 
 
 
  is called reduced.1 Notice that 
 
 
 
  is allowed for some i. It follows that every degree 0 divisor class contain a unique representative 
 
 
 
  with


 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is divisor that is coprime with both


 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 .
The other representation is balanced at infinity. Let 
 
 
 
 , note that this divisor is 
 
 
 
 -rational even if the points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are not independently so. Write the representative of the class 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is called the affine part and does not contain 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is even then


 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is odd then


 
 .2 For example, let the affine parts of two divisors be given by


 
  and 
 
 
 
  then the balanced divisors are


 
  and 
 
 

Transformation from real hyperelliptic curve to imaginary hyperelliptic curve
Let 
 
 
 
  be a real quadratic curve over a field 
 
 
 
 . If there exists a ramified prime divisor of degree 1 in 
 
 
 
  then we are able to perform a birational transformation to an imaginary quadratic curve. A (finite or infinite) point is said to be ramified if it is equal to its own opposite. It means that 
 
 
 
 , i.e. that 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is ramified then 
 
 
 
  is a ramified prime divisor.3
The real hyperelliptic curve 
 
 
 
  of genus 
 
 
 
  with a ramified 
 
 
 
 -rational finite point 
 
 
 
  is birationally equivalent to an imaginary model 
 
 
 
  of genus 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
  and the function fields are equal 
 
 
 
 .4 Here:


 
  and 
 
 
 
  … (i)
In our example 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 , h(x) is equal to 0. For any point 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is equal to 0 and so the requirement for P to be ramified becomes 
 
 
 
 . Substituting 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , we obtain 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
 .
From (i), we obtain 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  . For g=2, we have 
 
 

For example, let 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , we obtain


 
 .
To remove the denominators this expression is multiplied by 
 
 
 
 , then:



giving the curve


 
  where 
 
 
 
 .


 
  is an imaginary quadratic curve since 
 
 
 
  has degree 
 
 
 
 .
