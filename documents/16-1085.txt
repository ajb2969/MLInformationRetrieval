   Frequent subtree mining      Frequent subtree mining  In [[computer science]], '''frequent subtree mining''' is the problem of finding all patterns in a given database whose support (a metric related to its number of occurrences in other subtrees) is over a given threshold. 1 It is a more general form of the maximum agreement subtree problem. 2  Definition  Frequent subtree mining is the problem of trying to find all of the patterns whose "support" is over a certain user-specified support, where "support" is calculated as the number of trees in a database which have at least one subtree isomorphic to a given pattern. 3  Formal definition  The problem of frequent subtree mining has been formally defined as: 4   Given a threshold minfreq , a class of trees   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   , a transitive subtree relation    P  ⪯  T     precedes-or-equals  P  T    P\preceq T   between trees     P  ,  T   ∈  𝒞       P  T   𝒞    P,T\in\mathcal{C}   , a finite set of trees    𝒟  ⊆  𝒞      𝒟  𝒞    \mathcal{D}\subseteq\mathcal{C}   , the frequent subtree mining problem is the problem of finding all trees    𝒫  ⊂  𝒞      𝒫  𝒞    \mathcal{P}\subset\mathcal{C}   such that no two trees in   𝒫   𝒫   \mathcal{P}   are isomorphic and     ∀  P  ∈  𝒫  :  freq   (  P  ,  𝒟  )   =   ∑   T  ∈  𝒟    d   (  P  ,  T  )   ≥  minfreq  ,     fragments  for-all  P   P  normal-:   freq   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-,  D  normal-)     subscript     T  𝒟    d   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-,  T  normal-)    minfreq  normal-,    \forall P\in\mathcal{P}:\quad\mathrm{freq}(P,\mathcal{D})=\sum\nolimits_{T\in%
 \mathcal{D}}d(P,T)\geq\mathrm{minfreq},      where   d   d   d   is an anti-monotone function such that if     P  ′   ⪯  P     precedes-or-equals   superscript  P  normal-′   P    P^{\prime}\preceq P   then     ∀  T  ∈  𝒞  :  d   (   P  ′   ,  T  )   ≥  d   (  P  ,  T  )   .     fragments  for-all  T   C  normal-:   d   fragments  normal-(   superscript  P  normal-′   normal-,  T  normal-)    d   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-,  T  normal-)   normal-.    \forall T\in\mathcal{C}:\quad d(P^{\prime},T)\geq d(P,T).       Algorithms  In 2002, Mohammed J. Zaki introduced TreeMiner, an efficient algorithm for solving the frequent subtree mining problem, which used a "scope list" to represent tree nodes and which was contrasted with PatternMatcher, an algorithm based on pattern matching. 5  Applications  Domains in which frequent subtree mining is useful tend to involve complex relationships between data entities: for instance, the analysis of XML documents often requires frequent subtree mining. 6 Another domain where this is useful is the web usage mining problem: since the actions taken by users when visiting a web site can be recorded and categorized in many different ways, complex databases of trees need to be analyzed with frequent subtree mining. 7 Other domains in which frequent subtree mining is useful include computational biology, 8 9 RNA structure analysis, 10 pattern recognition, 11 bioinformatics, 12 and analysis of the KEGG GLYCAN database. 13  Challenges  Checking whether a pattern (or a transaction) supports a given subgraph is an NP-complete problem, since it is an NP-complete instance of the subgraph isomorphism problem . 14 Furthermore, due to combinatorial explosion , according to Lei et al., "mining all frequent subtree patterns becomes infeasible for a large and dense tree database". 15  References  "  Category:Computational problems in graph theory     ↩  ↩  Dai, H., Srikant, R. and Zhang, C.
