S-linalool synthase




S-linalool synthase

In enzymology, a S-linalool synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

geranyl diphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  (3S)-linalool + diphosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are geranyl diphosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are (3S)-linalool and diphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase [(3S)-linalool-forming]. Other names in common use include LIS, Lis, and 3S-linalool synthase.
