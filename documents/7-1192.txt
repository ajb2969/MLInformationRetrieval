Fixation index

The fixation index (FST) is a measure of population differentiation due to genetic structure. It is frequently estimated from genetic polymorphism data, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) or microsatellites. Developed as a special case of Wright's F-statistics, it is one of the most commonly used statistics in population genetics.
Definition
Two of the most commonly used definitions for FST at a given locus are based on the variance of allele frequencies between populations, and on the probability of Identity by descent.
If 
 
 
 
  is the average frequency of an allele in the total population, 
 
 
 
  is the variance in the frequency of the allele between different subpopulations, weighted by the sizes of the subpopulations, and 
 
 
 
  is the variance of the allelic state in the total population, FST is defined as 1



This definition, which is due to Wright, illustrates that FST measures the amount of genetic variance that can be explained by population structure. This can also be thought of as the fraction of total diversity that is not a consequence of the average diversity within subpopulations, where diversity is measured by the probability that two randomly selected alleles are different, namely 
 
 
 
 . If the allele frequency in the 
 
 
 
 th population is 
 
 
 
  and the relative size of the 
 
 
 
 th population is 
 
 
 
 , then



Alternatively,2



where 
 
 
 
  is the probability of identity by descent of two individuals given that the two individuals are in the same subpopulation, and 
 
 
 
  is the probability that two individuals from the total population are identical by descent. Using this definition, FST can be interpreted as measuring how much closer two individuals from the same subpopulation are, compared to the total population. If the mutation rate is small, this interpretation can be made more explicit by linking the probability of identity by descent to coalescent times: Let T0 and T denote the average time to coalescence for individuals from the same subpopulation and the total population, respectively. Then,



This formulation has the advantage that the expected time to coalescence can easily be estimated from genetic data, which led to the development of various estimators for FST.
Estimation
In practice, none of the quantities used for the definitions can be easily measured. As a consequence, various estimators have been proposed. A particularly simple estimator applicable to DNA sequence data is:3



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  represent the average number of pairwise differences between two individuals sampled from different sub-populations (
 
 
 
 ) or from the same sub-population (
 
 
 
 ). The average pairwise difference within a population can be calculated as the sum of the pairwise differences divided by the number of pairs. However, this estimator is biased when sample sizes are small or if they vary between populations. Therefore, more elaborate methods are used to compute FST in practice. Two of the most widely used procedures are the estimator by Weir & Cockerham (1984),4 or performing an Analysis of molecular variance. A list of implementations is available at the end of this article.
Interpretation
This comparison of genetic variability within and between populations is frequently used in applied population genetics. The values range from 0 to 1. A zero value implies complete panmixis; that is, that the two populations are interbreeding freely. A value of one implies that all genetic variation is explained by the population structure, and that the two populations do not share any genetic diversity.
For idealized models such as Wright's finite island model, FST can be used to estimate migration rates. Under that model, the migration rate is


 
 .
The interpretation of FST can be difficult when the data analyzed are highly polymorphic. In this case, the probability of identity by descent is very low and FST can have an arbitrarily low upper bound, which might lead to misinterpretation of the data. Also, strictly speaking FST is not a genetic distance, as it does not satisfy the triangle inequality. As a consequence new tools for measuring genetic differentiation continue being developed.
FST in humans
The International HapMap Project estimated FST for three human populations using SNP data. Across the autosomes, FST was estimated to be 0.12. The significance of this FST value in humans is contentious. As an FST of zero indicates no divergence between populations, whereas an FST of one indicates complete isolation of populations, Anthropologists often cite Lewontin's 1972 work which came to a similar value and interpreted this number as meaning there was little biological differences between human races.5 On the other hand, while an FST value of 0.12 is lower than that found between populations of many other species, Henry Harpending argued that this value implies on a world scale a "kinship between two individuals of the same human population is equivalent to kinship between grandparent and grandchild or between half siblings".6
