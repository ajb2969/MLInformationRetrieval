2'-Deamino-2'-hydroxyneamine transaminase

2'-Deamino-2'-hydroxyneamine transaminase (, kacL (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 2'-deamino-2'-hydroxyneamine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2'-deamino-2'-hydroxyneamine + 2-oxoglutarate $\rightleftharpoons$ 2'-deamino-2'-hydroxy-6'-dehydroparomamine + L-glutamate


The reaction occurs in vivo in the opposite direction.
