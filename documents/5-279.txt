   Brownian noise      Brownian noise    For similar phrases, see Brown note (disambiguation) .    (Figure)  Brown noise spectrum   In science , Brownian noise (), also known as Brown noise or red noise , is the kind of signal noise produced by Brownian motion , hence its alternative name of random walk noise . The term "Brown noise" comes not from the color , but after Robert Brown , the discoverer of Brownian motion.  Explanation  The graphic representation of the sound signal mimics a Brownian pattern. Its spectral density is inversely proportional to f², meaning it has more energy at lower frequencies, even more so than pink noise . It decreases in power by 6 dB per octave (20 dB per decade ) and, when heard, has a "damped" or "soft" quality compared to white and pink noise. The sound is a low roar resembling a waterfall or heavy rainfall. See also violet noise , which is a 6 dB increase per octave.  Power spectrum  A Brownian motion, also called a Wiener process , is obtained as the integral of a white noise signal,    d  W   (  t  )       d  W  t    dW(t)   ,       W   (  t  )    =    ∫  0  t    d  W   (  t  )           W  t     superscript   subscript   0   t     d  W  t      W(t)=\int_{0}^{t}dW(t)     meaning that Brownian motion is the integral of the white noise    d  W   (  t  )       d  W  t    dW(t)   whose power spectral density is flat 1      S  0   =    |   ℱ   [    d  W   (  t  )     d  t    ]    (  ω  )    |   2   =  const         subscript  S  0    superscript      ℱ   delimited-[]      d  W  t     d  t     ω    2        const     S_{0}=\left|\mathcal{F}\left[\frac{dW(t)}{dt}\right](\omega)\right|^{2}=\text{const}     Note that here   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   denotes the Fourier transform and    S  0     subscript  S  0    S_{0}   is a constant. An important property of this transform is that the derivative of any distribution transforms as 2      ℱ   [    d  W   (  t  )     d  t    ]    (  ω  )    =   i  ω  ℱ   [   W   (  t  )    ]    (  ω  )          ℱ   delimited-[]      d  W  t     d  t     ω     i  ω  ℱ   delimited-[]    W  t    ω     \mathcal{F}\left[\frac{dW(t)}{dt}\right](\omega)=i\omega\mathcal{F}[W(t)](\omega)     from which we can conclude that the power spectrum of Brownian noise is       S   (  ω  )    =    |   ℱ   [   W   (  t  )    ]    (  ω  )    |   2   =    S  0    ω  2            S  ω    superscript      ℱ   delimited-[]    W  t    ω    2           subscript  S  0    superscript  ω  2       S(\omega)=\left|\mathcal{F}[W(t)](\omega)\right|^{2}=\frac{S_{0}}{\omega^{2}}   .  Production  Brown noise can be produced by integrating  white noise . 3 4 That is, whereas ( digital ) white noise can be produced by randomly choosing each sample independently, Brown noise can be produced by adding a random offset to each sample to obtain the next one. Note that while the first sample is random across the entire range that the sound sample can take on, the remaining offsets from there on are a tenth or there abouts, leaving room for the signal to bounce around.
