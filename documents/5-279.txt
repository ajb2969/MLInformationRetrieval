Brown noise spectrum

In science, Brownian noise (), also known as Brown noise or red noise, is the kind of signal noise produced by Brownian motion, hence its alternative name of random walk noise. The term "Brown noise" comes not from the color, but after Robert Brown, the discoverer of Brownian motion.
Explanation
The graphic representation of the sound signal mimics a Brownian pattern. Its spectral density is inversely proportional to f², meaning it has more energy at lower frequencies, even more so than pink noise. It decreases in power by 6 dB per octave (20 dB per decade) and, when heard, has a "damped" or "soft" quality compared to white and pink noise. The sound is a low roar resembling a waterfall or heavy rainfall. See also violet noise, which is a 6 dB increase per octave.
Power spectrum
A Brownian motion, also called a Wiener process, is obtained as the integral of a white noise signal,

Production
Brown noise can be produced by integrating white noise.34 That is, whereas (digital) white noise can be produced by randomly choosing each sample independently, Brown noise can be produced by adding a random offset to each sample to obtain the next one. Note that while the first sample is random across the entire range that the sound sample can take on, the remaining offsets from there on are a tenth or there abouts, leaving room for the signal to bounce around.
