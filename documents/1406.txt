   Methanosarcina-phenazine hydrogenase      Methanosarcina-phenazine hydrogenase   In enzymology , a Methanosarcina-phenazine hydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   H 2 + 2-(2,3-dihydropentaprenyloxy)phenazine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-dihydropentaprenyloxyphenazine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are H 2 and 2-(2,3-dihydropentaprenyloxy)phenazine , whereas its product is 2-dihydropentaprenyloxyphenazine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on hydrogen as donor with other, known, acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hydrogen:2-(2,3-dihydropentaprenyloxy)phenazine oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include methanophenazine hydrogenase , and methylviologen-reducing hydrogenase .  References       "  Category:EC 1.12.98  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
