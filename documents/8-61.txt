   Commutation (neurophysiology)      Commutation (neurophysiology)   In neurophysiology , commutation is the process of how the brain's neural circuits exhibit non- commutativity . Physiologist Douglas B. Tweed and coworkers consider whether certain neural circuits in the brain exhibit noncommutativity and state:   In noncommutative algebra , order makes a difference to multiplication, so that     a  ×  b   ≠   b  ×  a         a  b     b  a     a\times b\neq b\times a   . This feature is necessary for computing rotary motion, because order makes a difference to the combined effect of two rotations. It has therefore been proposed that there are non-commutative operators in the brain circuits that deal with rotations, including motor system circuits that steer the eyes , head and limbs, and sensory system circuits that handle spatial information. This idea is controversial: studies of eye and head control have revealed behaviours that are consistent with non-commutativity in the brain, but none that clearly rules out all commutative models.   Tweed goes on to demonstrate non-commutative computation in the vestibulo-ocular reflex by showing that subjects rotated in darkness can hold their gaze points stable in space - correctly computing different final eye-position commands when put through the same two rotations in different orders, in a way that is unattainable by any commutative system. 1  References  "  Category:Neurophysiology     Douglas B.
