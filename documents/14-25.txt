   Reeb stability theorem      Reeb stability theorem   In mathematics , Reeb stability theorem , named after Georges Reeb , asserts that if one leaf of a codimension -one foliation is closed and has finite fundamental group , then all the leaves are closed and have finite fundamental group.  Reeb local stability theorem  Theorem: 1  Let   F   F   F   be a    C  1     superscript  C  1    C^{1}   , codimension   k   k   k    foliation of a manifold    M   M   M   and   L   L   L   a compact leaf with finite holonomy group . There exists a neighborhood    U   U   U   of   L   L   L   , saturated in   F   F   F   (also called invariant), in which all the leaves are compact with finite holonomy groups. Further, we can define a retraction     π  :   U  →  L      normal-:  π   normal-→  U  L     \pi:U\to L   such that, for every leaf     L  ′   ⊂  U       superscript  L  normal-′   U    L^{\prime}\subset U   ,      π  |    L  ′    :    L  ′   →  L      normal-:   evaluated-at  π   superscript  L  normal-′     normal-→   superscript  L  normal-′   L     \pi|_{L^{\prime}}:L^{\prime}\to L   is a covering map with a finite number of sheets and, for each    y  ∈  L      y  L    y\in L   ,     π   -  1     (  y  )        superscript  π    1    y    \pi^{-1}(y)   is homeomorphic to a disk of dimension k and is transverse to   F   F   F   . The neighborhood   U   U   U   can be taken to be arbitrarily small.  The last statement means in particular that, in a neighborhood of the point corresponding to a compact leaf with finite holonomy, the space of leaves is Hausdorff . Under certain conditions the Reeb local stability theorem may replace the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem in higher dimensions. 2 This is the case of codimension one, singular foliations    (   M  n   ,  F  )      superscript  M  n   F    (M^{n},F)   , with    n  ≥  3      n  3    n\geq 3   , and some center-type singularity in    S  i  n  g   (  F  )       S  i  n  g  F    Sing(F)   .  The Reeb local stability theorem also has a version for a noncompact codimension-1 leaf. 3 4  Reeb global stability theorem  An important problem in foliation theory is the study of the influence exerted by a compact leaf upon the global structure of a foliation . For certain classes of foliations, this influence is considerable.  Theorem: 5  Let   F   F   F   be a    C  1     superscript  C  1    C^{1}   , codimension one foliation of a closed manifold   M   M   M   . If   F   F   F   contains a compact leaf   L   L   L   with finite fundamental group , then all the leaves of   F   F   F   are compact, with finite fundamental group. If   F   F   F   is transversely orientable , then every leaf of   F   F   F   is diffeomorphic to   L   L   L   ;   M   M   M   is the total space of a fibration     f  :   M  →   S  1       normal-:  f   normal-→  M   superscript  S  1      f:M\to S^{1}   over    S  1     superscript  S  1    S^{1}   , with fibre    L   L   L   , and   F   F   F   is the fibre foliation,    {    f   -  1     (  θ  )    |   θ  ∈   S  1    }     conditional-set     superscript  f    1    θ     θ   superscript  S  1      \{f^{-1}(\theta)|\theta\in S^{1}\}   .  This theorem holds true even when   F   F   F   is a foliation of a manifold with boundary , which is, a priori, tangent on certain components of the boundary and transverse on other components. 6 In this case it implies Reeb sphere theorem .  Reeb Global Stability Theorem is false for foliations of codimension greater than one. 7 However, for some special kinds of foliations one has the following global stability results:   In the presence of a certain transverse geometric structure:   Theorem: 8  Let   F   F   F   be a complete  conformal foliation of codimension    k  ≥  3      k  3    k\geq 3   of a connected manifold   M   M   M   . If   F   F   F   has a compact leaf with finite holonomy group , then all the leaves of   F   F   F   are compact with finite holonomy group.   For holomorphic foliations in complex Kähler manifold :   Theorem: 9  Let   F   F   F   be a holomorphic foliation of codimension   k   k   k   in a compact complex Kähler manifold . If   F   F   F   has a compact leaf with finite holonomy group then every leaf of   F   F   F   is compact with finite holonomy group.  References   C. Camacho, A.
