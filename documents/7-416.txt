   Conical pendulum      Conical pendulum   A conical pendulum is a weight (or bob ) fixed on the end of a string (or rod) suspended from a pivot. Its construction is similar to an ordinary pendulum ; however, instead of rocking back and forth, the bob of a conical pendulum moves at a constant speed in a circle with the string (or rod) tracing out a cone . The conical pendulum was first studied by the English scientist Robert Hooke around 1660 1 as a model for the orbital motion of planets . 2 In 1673 Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens calculated its period, using his new concept of centrifugal force in his book Horologium Oscillatorium . Later it was used as the timekeeping element in a few mechanical clocks and other clockwork timing devices. 3 4  Uses  During the 1800s, conical pendulums were used as the timekeeping element in a few clockwork timing mechanisms where a smooth motion was required, as opposed to the unavoidably jerky motion provided by ordinary pendulums. 5 Two examples were mechanisms to turn the lenses of lighthouses to sweep their beams across the sea, and the location drives of equatorial mount  telescopes , to allow the telescope to follow a star smoothly across the sky as the Earth turns. 6  If you have ever played tetherball, you are playing with a conical pendulum that has the added complication of a string that varies in length as it winds or unwinds on the pole. Amusement parks often have swing rides that share a lot in common with our simple conical pendulum. The flyball governor (invented by James Watt) regulated the speed of early steam engines and also used a conical pendulum.  A pair of conical pendulums served as key components in the centrifugal governors used to regulate the operational speed of steam engines.  Analysis  Consider a conical pendulum consisting of a bob of mass m revolving without friction in a circle at a constant speed v on a string of length L at an angle of θ from the vertical.  There are two forces acting on the bob:   the tension T in the string, which is exerted along the line of the string and acts toward the point of suspension.  the downward bob weight  mg , where m is the mass of the bob and g is the local gravitational acceleration .   The force exerted by the string can be resolved into a horizontal component, T sin( θ ), toward the center of the circle, and a vertical component, T cos( θ ), in the upward direction. From Newton's second law , the horizontal component of the tension in the string gives the bob a centripetal acceleration toward the center of the circle:       T   sin  θ    =     m   v  2    r          T    θ        m   superscript  v  2    r     T\sin\theta=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\,     Since there is no acceleration in the vertical direction, the vertical component of the tension in the string is equal and opposite to the weight of the bob:       T   cos  θ    =   m   g          T    θ      m  g     T\cos\theta=mg\,     These two equations can be solved for T / m and equated, thereby eliminating T and m :       g   cos  θ    =    v  2    r   sin  θ           g    θ       superscript  v  2     r    θ       \frac{g}{\cos\theta}=\frac{v^{2}}{r\sin\theta}     Since the speed of the pendulum bob is constant, it can be expressed as the circumference 2 πr divided by the time t required for one revolution of the bob:      v  =    2  π  r   t       v      2  π  r   t     v=\frac{2\pi r}{t}     Substituting the right side of this equation for v in the previous equation, we find:       g   cos  θ    =     (    2  π  r   t   )   2    r   sin  θ     =      (   2  π   )   2   r     t  2    sin  θ             g    θ       superscript      2  π  r   t   2     r    θ               superscript    2  π   2   r      superscript  t  2     θ        \frac{g}{\cos\theta}=\frac{(\frac{2\pi r}{t})^{2}}{r\sin\theta}=\frac{(2\pi)^{%
 2}r}{t^{2}\sin\theta}     Using the trigonometric identity tan( θ ) = sin( θ ) / cos( θ ) and solving for t , the time required for the bob to travel one revolution is      t  =   2  π    r   g   tan  θ           t    2  π      r    g    θ         t=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{r}{g\tan\theta}}     In a practical experiment, r varies and is not as easy to measure as the constant string length L . r can be eliminated from the equation by noting that r , h , and L form a right triangle, with θ being the angle between the leg h and the hypotenuse L (see diagram). Therefore,      r  =   L   sin   θ         r    L    θ      r=L\sin\theta\,     Substituting this value for r yields a formula whose only varying parameter is the suspension angle θ : 7      t  =   2  π     L   cos  θ    g         t    2  π        L    θ    g       t=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L\cos\theta}{g}}     For small angles θ , cos( θ ) ≈ 1, and the period t of a conical pendulum is equal to the period of an ordinary pendulum of the same length. Also, the period for small angles is approximately independent of changes in the angle θ . This means the period of rotation is approximately independent of the force applied to keep it rotating. This property, called isochronism , is shared with ordinary pendulums and makes both types of pendulums useful for timekeeping.
