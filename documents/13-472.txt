   NumXL      NumXL   NumXL (Numerical Analysis for Excel) is an econometrics/time series analysis add-in for Microsoft Excel . Developed by Spider Financial, NumXL provides a wide variety of statistical and time series analysis techniques, including linear and nonlinear time series modeling, statistical tests and others.  Although NumXL is intended as an analytical add-in for Excel, it extends Excel‚Äôs user-interface and offers numerous wizards, menus and toolbars to automate the mundane phases of time series analysis. The features include summary statistics, test of hypothesis, correlogram analysis, modeling, calibration, residuals diagnosis, back-testing and forecast.  NumXL users come from various backgrounds of finance, economics, engineering and science. NumXL is used in academic and research institutions as well as industrial enterprises.  NumXL User's Interface  NumXL comes with an elaborate user-interface (i.e. menu and toolbar) and interactive wizards to improve the general usability of the software. The NumXL UI components automate some steps in time series analysis and modeling.  Using the UI components and the wizards, the user can specify the time series of interest, fine-tune the desired analysis options and designate the location on his/her worksheet for the output. NumXL generates the corresponding analysis blocks (with underlying formulas) in the designated location  Function Categories  NumXL Functions are organized into eleven(11) categories:  Descriptive Statistics   Autocorrelation function(ACF) and Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) .
