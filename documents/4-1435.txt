   Morava K-theory      Morava K-theory   In stable homotopy theory , a branch of mathematics , Morava K-theory is one of a collection of cohomology theories introduced in algebraic topology by Jack Morava in unpublished preprints in the early 1970s. For every prime number  p (which is suppressed in the notation), it consists of theories K ( n ) for each nonnegative integer n , each a ring spectrum in the sense of homotopy theory .  published the first account of the theories.  Details  The theory K (0) agrees with singular homology with rational coefficients, whereas K (1) is a summand of mod- p  complex K-theory . The theory K ( n ) has coefficient ring   F p [ v n , v n −1 ]   where v n has degree 2( p n − 1). In particular, Morava K-theory is periodic with this period, in much the same way that complex K-theory has period 2.  These theories have several remarkable properties.   They have Künneth isomorphisms for arbitrary pairs of spaces: that is, for X and Y CW complexes, we have         K    (  n  )   *    (   X  ×  Y   )    ≅     K    (  n  )   *    (  X  )     ⊗   K    (  n  )   *     K     (  n  )   *    (  Y  )     .        K   subscript  n      X  Y        subscript  tensor-product    K   subscript  n        K   subscript  n    X   K    subscript  n    Y     K(n)_{*}(X\times Y)\cong K(n)_{*}(X)\otimes_{K(n)_{*}}K(n)_{*}(Y).      They are "fields" in the category of ring spectra . In other words every module spectrum over K ( n ) is free, i.e. a wedge of suspensions of K ( n ).  They are complex oriented (at least after being periodified by taking the wedge sum of ( p n − 1) shifted copies), and the formal group they define has height  n .  Every finite p -local spectrum  X has the property that K ( n ) ∗ ( X ) = 0 if and only if n is less than a certain number N , called the type of the spectrum X . By a theorem of Devinatz– Hopkins –Smith, every thick subcategory of the category of finite p -local spectra is the subcategory of type- n spectra for some n .
