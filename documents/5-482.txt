   Vertex function      Vertex function   In quantum electrodynamics , the vertex function describes the coupling between a photon and an electron beyond the leading order of perturbation theory . In particular, it is the one particle irreducible correlation function involving the fermion     ψ    ψ   \psi~{}   , the antifermion    ψ  ¯     normal-¯  ψ    \bar{\psi}   , and the vector potential  A .  Definition  The vertex function Γ μ can be defined in terms of a functional derivative of the effective action S eff as       Γ  μ   =   -    1  e      δ  3    S  eff     δ   ψ  ¯   δ  ψ  δ   A  μ            superscript  normal-Γ  μ         1  e        superscript  δ  3    subscript  S  eff      δ   normal-¯  ψ   δ  ψ  δ   subscript  A  μ         \Gamma^{\mu}=-{1\over e}{\delta^{3}S_{\mathrm{eff}}\over\delta\bar{\psi}\delta%
 \psi\delta A_{\mu}}     The dominant (and classical) contribution to Γ μ is the gamma matrix γ μ , which explains the choice of the letter. The vertex function is constrained by the symmetries of quantum electrodynamics — Lorentz invariance ; gauge invariance or the transversality of the photon, as expressed by the Ward identity ; and invariance under parity — to take the following form:       Γ  μ   =     γ  μ    F  1    (   q  2   )    +     i   σ   μ  ν     q  ν     2  m     F  2    (   q  2   )          superscript  normal-Γ  μ        superscript  γ  μ    subscript  F  1    superscript  q  2          i   superscript  σ    μ  ν     subscript  q  ν      2  m     subscript  F  2    superscript  q  2       \Gamma^{\mu}=\gamma^{\mu}F_{1}(q^{2})+\frac{i\sigma^{\mu\nu}q_{\nu}}{2m}F_{2}(%
 q^{2})     where     σ   μ  ν    =    (   i  /  2   )    [   γ  μ   ,   γ  ν   ]         superscript  σ    μ  ν        i  2     superscript  γ  μ    superscript  γ  ν       \sigma^{\mu\nu}=(i/2)[\gamma^{\mu},\gamma^{\nu}]   ,    q  ν     subscript  q  ν    q_{\nu}   is the incoming four-momentum of the external photon (on the right-hand side of the figure), and F 1 (q 2 ) and F 2 (q 2 ) are form factors that depend only on the momentum transfer q 2 . At tree level (or leading order), F 1 (q 2 ) = 1 and F 2 (q 2 ) = 0. Beyond leading order, the corrections to F 1 (0) are exactly canceled by the wave function renormalization of the incoming and outgoing electron lines according to the Ward–Takahashi identity . The form factor F 2 (0) corresponds to the anomalous magnetic moment  a of the fermion, defined in terms of the Landé g-factor as:      a  =    g  -  2   2   =    F  2    (  0  )          a      g  2   2           subscript  F  2   0      a=\frac{g-2}{2}=F_{2}(0)     References   Michael E.
