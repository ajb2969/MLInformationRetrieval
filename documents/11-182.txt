   Carnitine dehydratase      Carnitine dehydratase   In enzymology , a carnitine dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-carnitine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-(trimethylammonio)but-2-enoate + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , L-carnitine , and two products , 4-(trimethylammonio)but-2-enoate and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-carnitine hydro-lyase [4-(trimethylammonio)but-2-enoate-forming] . This enzyme is also called L-carnitine hydro-lyase .
