Paley–Zygmund inequality

In mathematics, the Paley–Zygmund inequality bounds the probability that a positive random variable is small, in terms of its mean and variance (i.e., its first two moments). The inequality was proved by Raymond Paley and Antoni Zygmund.
Theorem: If Z ≥ 0 is a random variable with finite variance, and if 0  \operatorname{P}( Z > \theta\operatorname{E}[Z] ) \ge (1-\theta)^2 \frac{\operatorname{E}[Z]^2}{\operatorname{E}[Z^2]}. 
Proof: First,


 
  The first addend is at most 
 
 
 
 , while the second is at most 
 
 
 
  by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. The desired inequality then follows. ∎

This can be improved. By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality,



which, after rearranging, implies that



This inequality is sharp; equality is achieved if Z almost surely equals a positive constant, for example.
