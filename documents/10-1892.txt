Haloacetate dehalogenase




Haloacetate dehalogenase

In enzymology, a haloacetate dehalogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

haloacetate + H2O 
 
 
 
  glycolate + halide
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are haloacetate and H2O, whereas its two products are glycolate and halide.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on halide bonds in carbon-halide compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is haloacetate halidohydrolase. This enzyme is also called monohaloacetate dehalogenase. This enzyme participates in gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation and 1,2-dichloroethane degradation.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
