   Quasicircle      Quasicircle   In mathematics , a quasicircle is a Jordan curve in the complex plane that is the image of a circle under a quasiconformal mapping of the plane onto itself. Originally introduced independently by  and , in the older literature (in German) they were referred to as quasiconformal curves , a terminology which also applied to arcs . 1 2 In complex analysis and geometric function theory , quasicircles play a fundamental role in the description of the universal Teichmüller space , through quasisymmetric homeomorphisms of the circle. Quasicircles also play an important role in complex dynamical systems .  Definitions  A quasicircle is defined as the image of a circle under a quasiconformal mapping of the extended complex plane . It is called a K -quasicircle if the quasiconformal mapping has dilatation K . The definition of quasicircle generalizes the characterization of a Jordan curve as the image of a circle under a homeomorphism of the plane. In particular a quasicircle is a Jordan curve. The interior of a quasicircle is called a quasidisk . 3  As shown in , where the older term "quasiconformal curve" is used, if a Jordan curve is the image of a circle under a quasiconformal map in a neighbourhood of the curve, then it is also the image of a circle under a quasiconformal mapping of the extended plane and thus a quasicircle. The same is true for "quasiconformal arcs" which can be defined as quasiconformal images of a circular arc either in an open set or equivalently in the extended plane. 4  Geometric characterizations  gave a geometric characterization of quasicircles as those Jordan curves for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio of any four points, taken in cyclic order, is bounded below by a positive constant.  Ahlfors also proved that quasicircles can be characterized in terms of a reverse triangle inequality for three points: there should be a constant C such that if two points z 1 and z 2 are chosen on the curve and z 3 lies on the shorter of the resulting arcs, then 5         |    z  1   -   z  3    |   +   |    z  2   -   z  3    |    ≤   C   |    z  1   -   z  2    |     .             subscript  z  1    subscript  z  3          subscript  z  2    subscript  z  3        C       subscript  z  1    subscript  z  2        |z_{1}-z_{3}|+|z_{2}-z_{3}|\leq C|z_{1}-z_{2}|.     This property is also called bounded turning 6 or the arc condition . 7  For Jordan curves in the extended plane passing through ∞,  gave a simpler necessary and sufficient condition to be a quasicircle. 8 9 There is a constant C > 0 such that if z 1 , z 2 are any points on the curve and z 3 lies on the segment between them, then        |    z  3   -     z  1   +   z  2    2    |   ≤   C   |    z  1   -   z  2    |     .           subscript  z  3        subscript  z  1    subscript  z  2    2       C       subscript  z  1    subscript  z  2        \displaystyle{\left|z_{3}-{z_{1}+z_{2}\over 2}\right|\leq C|z_{1}-z_{2}|.}     These metric characterizations imply that an arc or closed curve is quasiconformal whenever it arises as the image of an interval or the circle under a bi-Lipschitz map  f , i.e. satisfying        C  1    |   s  -  t   |    ≤   |    f   (  s  )    -   f   (  t  )     |   ≤    C  2    |   s  -  t   |             subscript  C  1       s  t           f  s     f  t             subscript  C  2       s  t        C_{1}|s-t|\leq|f(s)-f(t)|\leq C_{2}|s-t|     for positive constants C i . 10  Quasicircles and quasisymmetric homeomorphisms  If φ is a quasisymmetric homeomorphism of the circle, then there are conformal maps f of [ z | 1 into disjoint regions such that the complement of the images of f and g is a Jordan curve. The maps f and g extend continuously to the circle | z | = 1 and the sewing equation      φ  =    g   -  1    ∘  f       φ     superscript  g    1    f     \varphi=g^{-1}\circ f     holds. The image of the circle is a quasicircle.  Conversely, using the Riemann mapping theorem , the conformal maps f and g uniformizing the outside of a quasicircle give rise to a quasisymmetric homeomorphism through the above equation.  The quotient space of the group of quasisymmetric homeomorphisms by the subgroup of Möbius transformations provides a model of universal Teichmüller space . The above correspondence shows that the space of quasicircles can also be taken as a model. 11  Quasiconformal reflection  A quasiconformal reflection in a Jordan curve is an orientation-reversing quasiconformal map of period 2 which switches the inside and the outside of the curve fixing points on the curve. Since the map        R  0    (  z  )    =   1   z  ¯           subscript  R  0   z     1   normal-¯  z      \displaystyle{R_{0}(z)={1\over\overline{z}}}     provides such a reflection for the unit circle, any quasicircle admits a quasiconformal reflection.  proved that this property characterizes quasicircles.  Ahlfors noted that this result can be applied to uniformly bounded holomorphic  univalent functions  f ( z ) on the unit disk D . Let Ω = f ( D ). As Carathéodory had proved using his theory of prime ends , f extends continuously to the unit circle if and only if ∂Ω is locally connected, i.e. admits a covering by finitely many compact connected sets of arbitrarily small diameter. The extension to the circle is 1-1 if and only if ∂Ω has no cut points, i.e. points which when removed from ∂Ω yield a disconnected set. Carathéodory's theorem shows that a locally set without cut points is just a Jordan curve and that in precisely this case is the extension of f to the closed unit disk a homeomorphism. 12 If f extends to a quasiconformal mapping of the extended complex plane then ∂Ω is by definition a quasicircle. Conversely  observed that if ∂Ω is a quasicircle and R 1 denotes the quasiconformal reflection in ∂Ω then the assignment       f   (  z  )    =    R  1   f   R  0    (  z  )          f  z      subscript  R  1   f   subscript  R  0   z     \displaystyle{f(z)=R_{1}fR_{0}(z)}     for | z | > 1 defines a quasiconformal extension of f to the extended complex plane.  Complex dynamical systems  Quasicircles were known to arise as the Julia sets of rational maps R ( z ).  proved that if the Fatou set of R has two components and the action of R on the Julia set is "hyperbolic", i.e. there are constants c > 0 and A > 1 such that       |     ∂  z    R  n     (  z  )    |   ≥   c   A  n              subscript   z    superscript  R  n    z      c   superscript  A  n      |\partial_{z}R^{n}(z)|\geq cA^{n}     on the Julia set, then the Julia set is a quasicircle. 13  There are many examples: 14 15   quadratic polynomials R ( z ) = z 2 + c with an attracting fixed point  the Douady rabbit ( c = –0.122561 + 0.744862i, where c 3 + 2 c 2 + c + 1 = 0)  quadratic polynomials z 2 + λ z with |λ| < 1  the Koch snowflake   Quasi-Fuchsian groups  Quasi-Fuchsian groups are obtained as quasiconformal deformations of Fuchsian groups . By definition their limit sets are quasicircles. 16 17 18 19 20  Let Γ be a Fuchsian group of the first kind: a discrete subgroup of the Möbius group preserving the unit circle. acting properly discontinuously on the unit disk D and with limit set the unit circle.  Let μ( z ) be a measurable function on D with        ∥  μ  ∥   ∞   <  1       subscript   norm  μ     1    \|\mu\|_{\infty}<1     such that μ is Γ-invariant, i.e.       μ   (   g   (  z  )    )        ∂  z   g    (  z  )    ¯      ∂  z   g    (  z  )      =   μ   (  z  )          μ    g  z      normal-¯      subscript   z   g   z        subscript   z   g   z       μ  z     \mu(g(z)){\overline{\partial_{z}g(z)}\over\partial_{z}g(z)}=\mu(z)     for every g in Γ. (μ is thus a "Beltrami differential" on the Riemann surface  D / Γ.)  Extend μ to a function on C by setting μ( z ) = 0 off D .  The Beltrami equation         ∂   z  ¯    f    (  z  )    =   μ   (  z  )     ∂  z   f    (  z  )            subscript    normal-¯  z    f   z     μ  z    subscript   z   f   z     \partial_{\overline{z}}f(z)=\mu(z)\partial_{z}f(z)     admits a solution unique up to composition with a Möbius transformation.  It is a quasiconformal homeomorphism of the extended complex plane.  If g is an element of Γ, then f ( g ( z )) gives another solution of the Beltrami equation, so that       α   (  g  )    =   f  ∘  g  ∘   f   -  1           α  g     f  g   superscript  f    1       \alpha(g)=f\circ g\circ f^{-1}     is a Möbius transformation.  The group α(Γ) is a quasi-Fuchsian group with limit set the quasicircle given by the image of the unit circle under f .  Hausdorff dimension  It is known that there are quasicircles for which no segment has finite length. 21 The Hausdorff dimension of quasicircles was first investigated by , who proved that it can take all values in the interval [1,2). 22 , using the new technique of "holomorphic motions" was able to estimate the change in the Hausdorff dimension of any planar set under a quasiconformal map with dilatation K . For quasicircles C , there was a crude estimate for the Hausdorff dimension 23        d  H    (  C  )    ≤   1  +  k          subscript  d  H   C     1  k     d_{H}(C)\leq 1+k     where       k  =    K  -  1    K  +  1     .      k      K  1     K  1      k={K-1\over K+1}.     On the other hand, the Hausdorff dimension for the Julia sets  J c of the iterates of the rational maps       R   (  z  )    =    z  2   +  c         R  z      superscript  z  2   c     R(z)=z^{2}+c     had been estimated as result of the work of Rufus Bowen and David Ruelle , who showed that       1  <    d  H    (   J  c   )    <   1  +     |  c  |   2    4   log  2     +   o   (    |  c  |   2   )      .        1     subscript  d  H    subscript  J  c           1     superscript    c   2     4    2       o   superscript    c   2        1     Since these are quasicircles corresponding to a dilatation      K  =     1  +  t    1  -  t         K        1  t     1  t       K=\sqrt{1+t\over 1-t}     where       t  =   |   1  -    1  -   4  c      |    ,      t      1      1    4  c         t=|1-\sqrt{1-4c}|,     this led  to show that for k small        1  +   0.36   k  2     ≤    d  H    (  C  )    ≤   1  +   37   k  2      .          1    0.36   superscript  k  2        subscript  d  H   C          1    37   superscript  k  2        1+0.36k^{2}\leq d_{H}(C)\leq 1+37k^{2}.     Having improved the lower bound following calculations for the Koch snowflake with Steffen Rohde and Oded Schramm ,  conjectured that         d  H    (  C  )    ≤   1  +   k  2     .         subscript  d  H   C     1   superscript  k  2      d_{H}(C)\leq 1+k^{2}.     This conjecture was proved by ; a complete account of his proof, prior to publication, was already given in .  For a quasi-Fuchsian group  and  showed that the Hausdorff dimension d of the limit set is always greater than 1. When d \lambda=d(2-d)\,\in (0,1)  is the lowest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the corresponding hyperbolic 3-manifold . 24 25  Notes  References         , Section 13.2, Dimension of quasicircles.
