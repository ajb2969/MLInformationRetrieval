Multidimensional network

Multidimensional networks are networks with multiple kinds of relations. Increasingly sophisticated attempts to model real-world systems as multidimensional networks have yielded valuable insight in the fields of social network analysis, economics, ecology, psychology,1 medicine, commerce, climatology, operations management, and finance.
Terminology
The rapid exploration of complex networks in recent years has been dogged by a lack of standardized naming conventions, as various groups use overlapping and contradictory23 terminology to describe specific network configurations (e.g., multiplex, multilayer, multilevel, multidimensional, multirelational, interconnected). Formally, multidimensional networks are edge-labeled multigraphs.4 The term "fully multidimensional" has also been used to refer to a multipartite edge-labeled multigraph.5 Multidimensional networks have also recently been reframed as specific instances of multilayer networks.678 In this case, there are as many layers as there are dimensions, and the links between nodes within each layer are simply all the links for a given dimension.
Model
Core elements
In elementary network theory, a network is represented by a graph 
 
 
 
  in which 
 
 
 
  is the set of nodes and 
 
 
 
  the links between nodes, typically represented as a tuple of nodes 
 
 
 
 . While this basic formalization is useful for analyzing many systems, real world networks often have added complexity in the form of multiple types of relations between system elements. The earliest formalizations of this idea came through its application in the field of social network analysis,9 in which multiple forms of social connection between people were represented by multiple types of links.10
To accommodate the presence of more than one type of link, a multidimensional network is represented by a triple 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a set of dimensions, each member of which is a different type of link, and 
 
 
 
  consists of triples 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .11
Extensions
In the case of a weighted network, this triplet is expanded to a quadruplet 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the weight on the link between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in the dimension 
 
 
 
 .
Further, as is often useful in social network analysis, link weights may take on positive or negative values. Such signed networks can better reflect relations like amity and enmity in social networks.12 Alternatively, link signs may be figured as dimensions themselves,13 e.g. 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  This approach has particular value when considering unweighted networks.
This conception of dimensionality can be expanded should attributes in multiple dimensions need specification. In this instance, links are n-tuples 
 
 
 
 . Such an expanded formulation, in which links may exist within multiple dimensions, is uncommon but has been used in the study of multidimensional time-varying networks.14
Comments
Note that as in all directed graphs, the links 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are distinct.
By convention, the number of links between two nodes in a given dimension is either 0 or 1 in a multidimensional network. However, the total number of links between two nodes across all dimensions is less than or equal to 
 
 
 
 .
Multidimensional network-specific parameters
Attributes
Degree
In a multidimensional network, the degree of a node is represented by a vector of length 
 
 
 
 . However, for some computations it may be more useful to simply sum the number of links adjacent to a node across all dimensions.15 This is the overlapping degree

 
 . As with unidimensional networks, distinction may similarly be drawn between incoming links and outgoing links.
Neighbors
In a multidimensional network, the neighbors of some node 
 
 
 
  are all nodes connected to 
 
 
 
  across dimensions.
Adjacency matrix
Whereas unidimensional networks have two-dimensional adjacency matrices of size 
 
 
 
 , in a multidimensional network with 
 
 
 
  dimensions, the adjacency matrix becomes a three-dimensional matrix of size 
 
 
 
 .16 As in unidimensional matrices, directed links, signed links, and weights are all easily accommodated by this framework.
Multi-layer path length
A path between two nodes in a multidimensional network can be represented by a vector r

 
  in which the 
 
 
 
 th entry in r is the number of links traversed in the 
 
 
 
 th dimension of 
 
 
 
 .17 As with overlapping degree, the sum of these elements can be taken as a rough measure of a path length between two nodes.
Path dominance
Given two multidimensional paths, r and s, we say that r dominates s if and only if
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .18
Multidimensional distance
One way to assess the distance between two nodes in a multidimensional network is by comparing all the multidimensional paths between them and choosing the subset that we define as shortest via path dominance: let 
 
 
 
  be the set of all paths between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Then the distance between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a set of paths 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  dominates 
 
 
 
 . The length of the elements in the set of shortest paths between two nodes is therefore defined as the multidimensional distance.19
Measures
Degree correlations
The question of degree correlations in unidimensional networks is fairly straightforward: do networks of similar degree tend to connect to each other? In multidimensional networks, what this question means becomes less clear. When we refer to a node's degree, are we referring to its degree in one dimension, or collapsed over all? When we seek to probe connectivity between nodes, are we comparing the same nodes across dimensions, or different nodes within dimensions, or a combination?20 What are the consequences of variations in each of these statistics on other network properties? In one study, assortativity was found to decrease robustness in a duplex network.21
Clustering coefficients
Like many other network statistics, the meaning of a clustering coefficient becomes ambiguous in multidimensional networks, due to the fact that triples may be closed in different dimensions than they originated.22 Several attempts have been made to define local clustering coefficients, but these attempts have highlighted the fact that the concept must be fundamentally different in higher dimensions: some groups have based their work off of non-standard definitions,23 while others have experimented with different definitions of random walks and 3-cycles in multidimensional networks.24
Community discovery
While cross-dimensional structures have been studied previously,2526 they fail to detect more subtle associations found in some networks. Taking a slightly different take on the definition of "community" in the case of multidimensional networks allows for reliable identification of communities without the requirement that nodes be in direct contact with each other.27 For instance, two people who never communicate directly yet still browse many of the same websites would be viable candidates for this sort of algorithm.
Dimension relevance
In a multidimensional network 
 
 
 
 , the relevance of a given dimension (or set of dimensions) 
 
 
 
  for one node can be assessed by the ratio
 
 
 
 .28
Dimension connectivity
In a multidimensional network in which different dimensions of connection have different real-world values, statistics characterizing the distribution of links to the various classes are of interest. Thus it is useful to consider two metrics that assess this: dimension connectivity and edge-exclusive dimension connectivity. The former is simply the ratio of the total number of links in a given dimension to the total number of links in every dimension
 
 
 
 . The latter assesses, for a given dimension, the number of pairs of nodes connected only by a link in that dimension
 
 
 
 .29
Shortest path discovery
Among other network statistics, many centrality measures rely on the ability to assess shortest paths from node to node. Extending these analyses to a multidimensional network requires incorporating additional connections between nodes into the algorithms currently used (e.g., Dijkstra's). Current approaches include collapsing multi-link connections between nodes in a preprocessing step before performing variations on a breadth-first search of the network.30
Burst detection
Burstiness is a well-known phenomenon in many real-world networks, e.g. email or other human communication networks. Additional dimensions of communication provide a more faithful representation of reality and may highlight these patterns or diminish them. Therefore it is of critical importance that our methods for detecting bursty behavior in networks accommodate multidimensional networks.31
