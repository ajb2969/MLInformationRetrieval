   Hereditary ring      Hereditary ring   In mathematics , especially in the area of abstract algebra known as module theory , a ring  R is called hereditary if all submodules of projective modules over R are again projective. If this is required only for finitely generated submodules, it is called semihereditary .  For a noncommutative ring R , the terms left hereditary and left semihereditary and their right hand versions are used to distinguish the property on a single side of the ring. To be left (semi-)hereditary, all (finitely generated) submodules of projective left  R -modules must be projective, and to be right (semi-)hereditary all (finitely generated) submodules of projective right submodules must be projective. It is possible for a ring to be left (semi-)hereditary but not right (semi-)hereditary, and vice versa.  Equivalent definitions   The ring R is left (semi-)hereditary if and only if all ( finitely generated ) left ideals of R are projective modules. 1 2  The ring R is left hereditary if and only if all left modules have projective resolutions of length at most 1. Hence the usual derived functors such as    Ext  R  i     superscript   subscript  Ext  R   i    \mathrm{Ext}_{R}^{i}   and    Tor  i  R     superscript   subscript  Tor  i   R    \mathrm{Tor}_{i}^{R}   are trivial for    i  >  1      i  1    i>1   .   Examples   Semisimple rings are easily seen to be left and right hereditary via the equivalent definitions: all left and right ideals are summands of R , and hence are projective. By a similar token, in a von Neumann regular ring every finitely generated left and right ideal is a direct summand of R , and so von Neumann regular rings are left and right semihereditary.    For any nonzero element x in a domain  R ,    R  ≅   x  R       R    x  R     R\cong xR   via the map    r  ↦   x  r      maps-to  r    x  r     r\mapsto xr   . Hence in any domain, a principal right ideal is free, hence projective. This reflects the fact that domains are right Rickart rings . It follows that if R is a right Bézout domain , so that finitely generated right ideals are principal, then R has all finitely generated right ideals projective, and hence R is right semihereditary. Finally if R is assumed to be a principal right ideal domain , then all right ideals are projective, and R is right hereditary.    A commutative hereditary integral domain is called a Dedekind domain . A commutative semi-hereditary integral domain is called a Prüfer domain .    An important example of a (left) hereditary ring is the path algebra of a quiver . This is a consequence of the existence of the standard resolution (which is of length 1) for modules over a path algebra.   Properties   For a left hereditary ring R , every submodule of a free left R -module is isomorphic to a direct sum of left ideals of R and hence is projective. 3   References         "  Category:Ring theory     ↩  ↩
