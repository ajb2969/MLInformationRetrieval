4-Dimethylallyltryptophan N-methyltransferase

4-dimethylallyltryptophan N-methyltransferase (, fgaMT (gene), easF (gene)) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:4-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-L-tryptophan N-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 4-dimethylallyl-L-tryptophan 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 4-dimethylallyl-L-abrine
 

The enzyme catalyses a step in the pathway leading to biosynthesis of ergot alkaloids in certain fungi.
