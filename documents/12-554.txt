   Fast Walsh–Hadamard transform      Fast Walsh–Hadamard transform     In computational mathematics, the Hadamard ordered fast Walsh–Hadamard transform ( FWHT h ) is an efficient algorithm to compute the Walsh–Hadamard transform (WHT). A naive implementation of the WHT would have a computational complexity of O( $N^2$ ) . The FWHT h requires only $N \log N$ additions or subtractions.  The FWHT h is a divide and conquer algorithm that recursively breaks down a WHT of size $N$ into two smaller WHTs of size $N/2$ . This implementation follows the recursive definition of the $2N \times 2N$  Hadamard matrix  $H_N$ :  $$H_N = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \begin{pmatrix} H_{N-1} & H_{N-1} \\ H_{N-1} & -H_{N-1} \end{pmatrix}.$$  The $1/\sqrt2$ normalization factors for each stage may be grouped together or even omitted.  The Sequency ordered , also known as Walsh ordered, fast Walsh–Hadamard transform, FWHT w , is obtained by computing the FWHT h as above, and then rearranging the outputs.
