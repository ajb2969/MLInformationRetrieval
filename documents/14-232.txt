   Time evolution of integrals      Time evolution of integrals   In many applications, one needs to calculate the rate of change of a volume or surface integral whose domain of integration , as well as the integrand , are functions of a particular parameter. In physical applications, that parameter is frequently time  t .  Introduction  The rate of change of one-dimensional integrals with sufficiently smooth integrands, is governed by this extension of the fundamental theorem of calculus :        d   d  t      ∫   a   (  t  )     b   (  t  )      f   (  t  ,  x  )   d  x     =      ∫   a   (  t  )     b   (  t  )         ∂  f    (  t  ,  x  )     ∂  t    d  x    +   f   (  t  ,   b   (  t  )    )    b  ′    (  t  )     -   f   (  t  ,   a   (  t  )    )    a  ′    (  t  )             d    d  t      superscript   subscript     a  t      b  t      f   t  x   d  x           superscript   subscript     a  t      b  t            f    t  x      t    d  x      f   t    b  t     superscript  b  normal-′   t      f   t    a  t     superscript  a  normal-′   t      \frac{d}{dt}\int_{a\left(t\right)}^{b\left(t\right)}f\left(t,x\right)dx=\int_{%
 a\left(t\right)}^{b\left(t\right)}\frac{\partial f\left(t,x\right)}{\partial t%
 }dx+f\left(t,b\left(t\right)\right)b^{\prime}\left(t\right)-f\left(t,a\left(t%
 \right)\right)a^{\prime}\left(t\right)     The calculus of moving surfaces 1 provides analogous formulas for volume integrals over Euclidean domains , and surface integrals over differential geometry of surfaces , curved surfaces, including integrals over curved surfaces with moving contour boundaries .  Volume integrals  Let t be a time-like parameter and consider a time-dependent domain Ω with a smooth surface boundary S . Let F be a time-dependent invariant field defined in the interior of Ω. Then the rate of change of the integral      ∫  Ω     F   d  Ω       subscript   normal-Ω     F  d  normal-Ω     \int_{\Omega}F\,d\Omega     is governed by the following law: 2        d   d  t      ∫  Ω     F   d  Ω     =     ∫  Ω       ∂  F    ∂  t     d  Ω    +    ∫  S    C   F   d  S             d    d  t      subscript   normal-Ω     F  d  normal-Ω         subscript   normal-Ω         F     t    d  normal-Ω      subscript   S     C  F  d  S       \frac{d}{dt}\int_{\Omega}F\,d\Omega=\int_{\Omega}\frac{\partial F}{\partial t}%
 \,d\Omega+\int_{S}CF\,dS     where C is the velocity of the interface . The velocity of the interface C is the fundamental concept in the calculus of moving surfaces . In the above equation, C must be expressed with respect to the exterior normal . This law can be considered as the generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus .  Surface integrals  A related law governs the rate of change of the surface integral       ∫  S     F   d  S       subscript   S     F  d  S     \int_{S}F\,dS     The law reads        d   d  t      ∫  S     F   d  S     =     ∫  S       δ  F    δ  t     d  S    -    ∫  S    C    B  α  α    d  S             d    d  t      subscript   S     F  d  S         subscript   S         δ  F     δ  t    d  S      subscript   S     C   subscript   superscript  B  α   α   d  S       \frac{d}{dt}\int_{S}F\,dS=\int_{S}\frac{\delta F}{\delta t}\,dS-\int_{S}CB^{%
 \alpha}_{\alpha}\,dS     where the     δ  /  δ   t        δ  δ   t    {\delta}/{\delta}t   - derivative is the fundamental operator in the calculus of moving surfaces , originally proposed by Jacques Hadamard .    B  α  α     subscript   superscript  B  α   α    B^{\alpha}_{\alpha}   is the trace of the mean curvature tensor . In this law, C need not be expression with respect to the exterior normal, as long as the choice of the normal is consistent for C and    B  α  α     subscript   superscript  B  α   α    B^{\alpha}_{\alpha}   . The first term in the above equation captures the rate of change in F while the second corrects for expanding or shrinking area. The fact that mean curvature represents the rate of change in area follows from applying the above equation to    F  ≡  1      F  1    F\equiv 1   since      ∫  S     d  S       subscript   S     d  S     \int_{S}\,dS   is area:        d   d  t      ∫  S     S   d  S     =   -    ∫  S    C    B  α  α    d  S             d    d  t      subscript   S     S  d  S         subscript   S     C   subscript   superscript  B  α   α   d  S       \frac{d}{dt}\int_{S}S\,dS=-\int_{S}CB^{\alpha}_{\alpha}\,dS     The above equation shows that mean curvature    B  α  α     subscript   superscript  B  α   α    B^{\alpha}_{\alpha}   can be appropriately called the shape gradient of area. An evolution governed by      C  ≡   B  α  α       C   subscript   superscript  B  α   α     C\equiv B^{\alpha}_{\alpha}     is the popular mean curvature flow and represents steepest descent with respect to area. Note that for a sphere of radius R ,     B  α  α   =   -   2  /  R         subscript   superscript  B  α   α       2  R      B^{\alpha}_{\alpha}=-2/R   , and for a circle of radius R ,     B  α  α   =   -   1  /  R         subscript   superscript  B  α   α       1  R      B^{\alpha}_{\alpha}=-1/R   with respect to the exterior normal.  Surface integrals with moving contour boundaries  (Figure)  Illustration for the law for surface integrals with a moving contour. Change in area comes from two sources: expansion by curvature    C   B  α  α   d  t      C   subscript   superscript  B  α   α   d  t    CB^{\alpha}_{\alpha}dt   and expansion by annexation    c  d  t      c  d  t    cdt   .   Suppose that S is a moving surface with a moving contour γ. Suppose that the velocity of the contour γ with respect to S is c . Then the rate of change of the time dependent integral:       ∫  S     F   d  S       subscript   S     F  d  S     \int_{S}F\,dS     is        d   d  t      ∫  S     F   d  S     =      ∫  S       δ  F    δ  t     d  S    -    ∫  S    C   B  α  α    F   d  S     +    ∫  γ     c   d  γ             d    d  t      subscript   S     F  d  S           subscript   S         δ  F     δ  t    d  S      subscript   S     C   superscript   subscript  B  α   α   F  d  S       subscript   γ     c  d  γ       \frac{d}{dt}\int_{S}F\,dS=\int_{S}\frac{\delta F}{\delta t}\,dS-\int_{S}CB_{%
 \alpha}^{\alpha}F\,dS+\int_{\gamma}c\,d\gamma     The last term captures the change in area due to annexation, as the figure on the right illustrates.
