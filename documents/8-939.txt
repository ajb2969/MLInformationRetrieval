   Kramers theorem      Kramers theorem   In quantum mechanics, the Kramers degeneracy theorem states that for every energy eigenstate of a time-reversal symmetric system with half-integer total spin, there is at least one more eigenstate with the same energy. In other words, every energy level is at least doubly degenerate if it has half-integer spin.  In theoretical physics, the time reversal symmetry is the symmetry of physical laws under a time reversal transformation:       T  :   t  ↦   -  t     .     normal-:  T   maps-to  t    t      T:t\mapsto-t.   If the Hamiltonian operator commutes with the time-reversal operator, that is        [  H  ,  T  ]   =  0   ,       H  T   0    [H,T]=0,   then for every energy eigenstate    |  n  ⟩     ket  n    |n\rangle   , the time reversed state    T   |  n  ⟩       T   ket  n     T|n\rangle   is also an eigenstate with the same energy. Of course, this time reversed state might be identical to the original state, but that is not possible in a half-integer spin system since time reversal reverses all angular momenta, and reversing a half-integer spin cannot yield the same state (the magnetic quantum number is never zero).  For instance, the energy levels of a system with an odd total number of fermions (such as electrons , protons and neutrons ) remain at least doubly degenerate in the presence of purely electric fields (i.e. no magnetic fields ). It was first discovered in 1930 by H. A. Kramers 1 as a consequence of the Breit equation .  As shown by Eugene Wigner in 1932, 2 it is a consequence of the time reversal invariance of electric fields , and follows from an application of the antiunitary T-operator to the wavefunction of an odd number of fermions. The theorem is valid for any configuration of static or time-varying electric fields.  For example: the hydrogen (H) atom contains one proton and one electron, so that the Kramers theorem does not apply. The lowest (hyperfine) energy level of H is nondegenerate. The deuterium (D) isotope on the other hand contains an extra neutron, so that the total number of fermions is three, and the theorem does apply. The ground state of D contains two hyperfine components, which are twofold and fourfold degenerate.
