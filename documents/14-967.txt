Cellular algebra

In abstract algebra, a cellular algebra is a finite-dimensional associative algebra A with a distinguished cellular basis which is particularly well-adapted to studying the representation theory of A.
History
The cellular algebras discussed in this article were introduced in a 1996 paper of Graham and Lehrer.1 However, the terminology had previously been used by Weisfeiler and Lehman in the Soviet Union in the 1960s, to describe what are also known as association schemes. 23
Definitions
Let 
 
 
 
  be a fixed commutative ring with unit. In most applications this is a field, but this is not needed for the definitions. Let also 
 
 
 
  be a 
 
 
 
 -algebra.
The concrete definition
A cell datum for 
 
 
 
  is a tuple 
 
 
 
  consisting of

A finite partially ordered set 
 
 
 
 .
A 
 
 
 
 -linear anti-automorphism

 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
For every 
 
 
 
  a non-empty, finite set 
 
 
 
  of indices.
An injective map





The images under this map are notated with an upper index 
 
 
 
  and two lower indices 
 
 
 
  so that the typical element of the image is written as 
 
 
 
 .
 

and satisfying the following conditions:

The image of 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -basis of 
 
 
 
 .


 
  for all elements of the basis.
For every 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and every 
 
 
 
  the equation






with coefficients 
 
 
 
  depending only on 
 
 
 
 ,
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  but not on 
 
 
 
 . Here 
 
 
 
  denotes the 
 
 
 
 -span of all basis elements with upper index strictly smaller than 
 
 
 
 .
 



This definition was originally given by Graham and Lehrer who invented cellular algebras.4
The more abstract definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be an anti automorphism of 
 
 
 
 -algebras with 
 
 
 
  (just called "involution" from now on).
A cell ideal of 
 
 
 
  w.r.t. 
 
 
 
  is a two-sided ideal 
 
 
 
  such that the following conditions hold:



 
 .
There is a left ideal 
 
 
 
  that is free as a 
 
 
 
 -module and an isomorphism






of 
 
 
 
 -
 
 
 
 -bimodules such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are compatible in the sense that
 






A cell chain for 
 
 
 
  w.r.t. 
 
 
 
  is defined as a direct decomposition


 
  into free 
 
 
 
 -submodules such that






 
  is a two-sided ideal of 
 
 



 
  is a cell ideal of 
 
 
 
  w.r.t. to the induced involution.

Now 
 
 
 
  is called a cellular algebra if it has a cell chain. One can show that the two definitions are equivalent.5 Every basis gives rise to cell chains (one for each topological ordering of 
 
 
 
 ) and choosing a basis of every left ideal 
 
 
 
  one can construct a corresponding cell basis for 
 
 
 
 .
Examples
Polynomial examples


 
  is cellular. A cell datum is given by 
 
 
 
  and



 
  with the reverse of the natural ordering.







A cell-chain in the sense of the second, abstract definition is given by



Matrix examples


 
  is cellular. A cell datum is given by 
 
 
 
  and







For the basis one chooses 
 
 
 
  the standard matrix units, i.e. 
 
 
 
  is the matrix with all entries equal to zero except the (s,t)-th entry which is equal to 1.

A cell-chain (and in fact the only cell chain) is given by



In some sense all cellular algebras "interpolate" between these two extremes by arranging matrix-algebra-like pieces according to the poset 
 
 
 
 .
Further examples
Modulo minor technicalities all Iwahori–Hecke algebras of finite type are cellular w.r.t. to the involution that maps the standard basis as 
 
 
 
 .6 This includes for example the integral group algebra of the symmetric groups as well as all other finite Weyl groups.
A basic Brauer tree algebra over a field is cellular if and only if the Brauer tree is a straight line (with arbitrary number of exceptional vertices).7
Further examples include q-Schur algebras, the Brauer algebra, the Temperley–Lieb algebra, the Birman–Murakami–Wenzl algebra, the blocks of the Bernstein–Gelfand–Gelfand category 
 
 
 
  of a semisimple Lie algebra.8
Representations
Cell modules and the invariant bilinear form
Assume 
 
 
 
  is cellular and 
 
 
 
  is a cell datum for 
 
 
 
 . Then one defines the cell module

 
  as the free 
 
 
 
 -module with basis 
 
 
 
  and multiplication


 
  where the coefficients 
 
 
 
  are the same as above. Then 
 
 
 
  becomes an 
 
 
 
 -left module.
These modules generalize the Specht modules for the symmetric group and the Hecke-algebras of type A.
There is a canonical bilinear form 
 
 
 
  which satisfies


 
  for all indices 
 
 
 
 .
One can check that 
 
 
 
  is symmetric in the sense that


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and also 
 
 
 
 -invariant in the sense that


 
  for all 
 
 
 
 ,
 
 
 
 .
Simple modules
Assume for the rest of this section that the ring 
 
 
 
  is a field. With the information contained in the invariant bilinear forms one can easily list all simple 
 
 
 
 -modules:
Let 
 
 
 
  and define 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . Then all 
 
 
 
  are absolute simple

 
 -modules and every simple 
 
 
 
 -module is one of these.
These theorems appear already in the original paper by Graham and Lehrer.9
Properties of cellular algebras
Persistence properties

Tensor products of finitely many cellular 
 
 
 
 -algebras are cellular.
A 
 
 
 
 -algebra 
 
 
 
  is cellular if and only if its opposite algebra

 
  is.
If 
 
 
 
  is cellular with cell-datum 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is an ideal (a downward closed subset) of the poset 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  (where the sum runs over 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ) is an twosided, 
 
 
 
 -invariant ideal of 
 
 
 
  and the quotient 
 
 
 
  is cellular with cell datum 
 
 
 
  (where i denotes the induces involution and M,C denote the restricted mappings).
If 
 
 
 
  is a cellular 
 
 
 
 -algebra and 
 
 
 
  is a unitary homomorphism of commutative rings, then the extension of scalars

 
  is a cellular 
 
 
 
 -algebra.
Direct products of finitely many cellular 
 
 
 
 -algebras are cellular.

If 
 
 
 
  is an integral domain then there is a converse to this last point:

If 
 
 
 
  is a finite dimensional 
 
 
 
 -algebra with an involution and 
 
 
 
  a decomposition in twosided, 
 
 
 
 -invariant ideals, then the following are equivalent:




 
  is cellular.


 
  and 
 
 
 
  are cellular.


Since in particular all blocks of 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
 
 -invariant if 
 
 
 
  is cellular, an immediate corollary is that a finite dimensional 
 
 
 
 -algebra is cellular w.r.t. 
 
 
 
  if and only if all blocks are 
 
 
 
 -invariante and cellular w.r.t. 
 
 
 
 .
Tits' deformation theorem for cellular algebras: Let 
 
 
 
  be a cellular 
 
 
 
 -algebra. Also let 
 
 
 
  be a unitary homomorphism into a field 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the quotient field of 
 
 
 
 . Then the following holds: If 
 
 
 
  is semisimple, then 
 
 
 
  is also semisimple.

If one further assumes 
 
 
 
  to be a local domain, then additionally the following holds:

If 
 
 
 
  is cellular w.r.t. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is an idempotent such that 
 
 
 
 , then the Algebra 
 
 
 
  is cellular.

Other properties
Assuming that 
 
 
 
  is a field (though a lot of this can be generalized to arbitrary rings, integral domains, local rings or at least discrete valuation rings) and 
 
 
 
  is cellular w.r.t. to the involution 
 
 
 
 . Then the following hold



 
  is split, i.e. all simple modules are absolutely irreducible.
The following are equivalent:10




 
  is semisimple.


 
  is split semisimple.


 
  is simple.


 
  is nondegenerate.


The Cartan matrix

 
  of 
 
 
 
  is symmetric and positive definite.
The following are equivalent:11




 
  is quasi-hereditary (i.e. its module category is a highest-weight category).


 
 .
All cell chains of 
 
 
 
  have the same length.
All cell chains of 
 
 
 
  have the same length where 
 
 
 
  is an arbitrary involution w.r.t. which 
 
 
 
  is cellular.


 
 .


If 
 
 
 
  is Morita equivalent to 
 
 
 
  and the characteristic of 
 
 
 
  is not two, then 
 
 
 
  is also cellular w.r.t. an suitable involution. In particular is 
 
 
 
  cellular (to some involution) if and only if its basic algebra is.12
Every idempotent 
 
 
 
  is equivalent to 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  then in fact every equivalence class contains an 
 
 
 
 -invariant idempotent.13
