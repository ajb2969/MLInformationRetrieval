   Cellular algebra      Cellular algebra   In abstract algebra , a cellular algebra is a finite-dimensional  associative algebra  A with a distinguished cellular basis which is particularly well-adapted to studying the representation theory of A .  History  The cellular algebras discussed in this article were introduced in a 1996 paper of Graham and Lehrer. 1 However, the terminology had previously been used by Weisfeiler and Lehman in the Soviet Union in the 1960s, to describe what are also known as association schemes . 2 3  Definitions  Let   R   R   R   be a fixed commutative ring with unit. In most applications this is a field, but this is not needed for the definitions. Let also   A   A   A   be a   R   R   R   -algebra.  The concrete definition  A cell datum for   A   A   A   is a tuple    (  Λ  ,  i  ,  M  ,  C  )     normal-Λ  i  M  C    (\Lambda,i,M,C)   consisting of   A finite partially ordered set   Λ   normal-Λ   \Lambda   .  A   R   R   R   -linear anti-automorphism     i  :   A  →  A      normal-:  i   normal-→  A  A     i:A\to A   with     i  2   =   i   d  A         superscript  i  2     i   subscript  d  A      i^{2}=id_{A}   .  For every    λ  ∈  Λ      λ  normal-Λ    \lambda\in\Lambda   a non-empty, finite set    M   (  λ  )       M  λ    M(\lambda)   of indices.  An injective map       C  :        ⋃  ˙    λ  ∈  Λ    M   (  λ  )    ×  M    (  λ  )    →  A      normal-:  C   normal-→         subscript   normal-˙      λ  normal-Λ    M  λ   M   λ   A     C:\dot{\bigcup}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}M(\lambda)\times M(\lambda)\to A      The images under this map are notated with an upper index    λ  ∈  Λ      λ  normal-Λ    \lambda\in\Lambda   and two lower indices     𝔰  ,  𝔱   ∈   M   (  λ  )         𝔰  𝔱     M  λ     \mathfrak{s},\mathfrak{t}\in M(\lambda)   so that the typical element of the image is written as    C   𝔰  𝔱   λ     superscript   subscript  C    𝔰  𝔱    λ    C_{\mathfrak{st}}^{\lambda}   .   and satisfying the following conditions:   The image of   C   C   C   is a   R   R   R   -basis of   A   A   A   .       i   (   C   𝔰  𝔱   λ   )    =   C   𝔱  𝔰   λ         i   superscript   subscript  C    𝔰  𝔱    λ     superscript   subscript  C    𝔱  𝔰    λ     i(C_{\mathfrak{st}}^{\lambda})=C_{\mathfrak{ts}}^{\lambda}   for all elements of the basis.  For every    λ  ∈  Λ      λ  normal-Λ    \lambda\in\Lambda   ,     𝔰  ,  𝔱   ∈   M   (  λ  )         𝔰  𝔱     M  λ     \mathfrak{s},\mathfrak{t}\in M(\lambda)   and every    a  ∈  A      a  A    a\in A   the equation          a   C   𝔰  𝔱   λ    ≡     ∑   𝔲  ∈   M   (  λ  )        r  a    (  𝔲  ,  𝔰  )    C   𝔲  𝔱   λ     mod   A     (    <  λ   )           a   superscript   subscript  C    𝔰  𝔱    λ     modulo    subscript     𝔲    M  λ        subscript  r  a    𝔲  𝔰    superscript   subscript  C    𝔲  𝔱    λ      annotated  A    absent  λ       aC_{\mathfrak{st}}^{\lambda}\equiv\sum_{\mathfrak{u}\in M(\lambda)}r_{a}(%
 \mathfrak{u},\mathfrak{s})C_{\mathfrak{ut}}^{\lambda}\mod A(<\lambda)     with coefficients      r  a    (  𝔲  ,  𝔰  )    ∈  R         subscript  r  a    𝔲  𝔰    R    r_{a}(\mathfrak{u},\mathfrak{s})\in R   depending only on   a   a   a   ,   𝔲   𝔲   \mathfrak{u}   and   𝔰   𝔰   \mathfrak{s}   but not on   𝔱   𝔱   \mathfrak{t}   . Here    A     (    <  λ   )      annotated  A    absent  λ     A(<\lambda)   denotes the   R   R   R   -span of all basis elements with upper index strictly smaller than   λ   λ   \lambda   .     This definition was originally given by Graham and Lehrer who invented cellular algebras. 4  The more abstract definition  Let    i  :   A  →  A      normal-:  i   normal-→  A  A     i:A\to A   be an anti automorphism of   R   R   R   -algebras with     i  2   =   i  d        superscript  i  2     i  d     i^{2}=id   (just called "involution" from now on).  A cell ideal of   A   A   A   w.r.t.   i   i   i   is a two-sided ideal    J  ⊆  A      J  A    J\subseteq A   such that the following conditions hold:        i   (  J  )    =  J        i  J   J    i(J)=J   .  There is a left ideal    Δ  ⊆  J      normal-Δ  J    \Delta\subseteq J   that is free as a   R   R   R   -module and an isomorphism         α  :     Δ   ⊗  R   i    (  Δ  )    →  J      normal-:  α   normal-→      subscript  tensor-product  R   normal-Δ  i   normal-Δ   J     \alpha:\Delta\otimes_{R}i(\Delta)\to J     of   A   A   A   -   A   A   A   -bimodules such that   α   α   \alpha   and   i   i   i   are compatible in the sense that         ∀  x   ,  y   ∈  Δ   :    i   (   α   (    x  ⊗  i    (  y  )    )    )    =   α   (    y  ⊗  i    (  x  )    )        normal-:      for-all  x   y   normal-Δ       i    α     tensor-product  x  i   y       α     tensor-product  y  i   x       \forall x,y\in\Delta:i(\alpha(x\otimes i(y)))=\alpha(y\otimes i(x))        A cell chain for   A   A   A   w.r.t.   i   i   i   is defined as a direct decomposition      A  =    ⊕   k  =  1   m    U  k        A    superscript   subscript  direct-sum    k  1    m    subscript  U  k      A=\bigoplus_{k=1}^{m}U_{k}   into free   R   R   R   -submodules such that        i   (   U  k   )    =   U  k         i   subscript  U  k     subscript  U  k     i(U_{k})=U_{k}          J  k   :=    ⊕   j  =  1   k    U  j       assign   subscript  J  k     superscript   subscript  direct-sum    j  1    k    subscript  U  j      J_{k}:=\bigoplus_{j=1}^{k}U_{j}   is a two-sided ideal of   A   A   A          J  k   /   J   k  -  1         subscript  J  k    subscript  J    k  1      J_{k}/J_{k-1}   is a cell ideal of    A  /   J   k  -  1        A   subscript  J    k  1      A/J_{k-1}   w.r.t. to the induced involution.   Now    (  A  ,  i  )     A  i    (A,i)   is called a cellular algebra if it has a cell chain. One can show that the two definitions are equivalent. 5 Every basis gives rise to cell chains (one for each topological ordering of   Λ   normal-Λ   \Lambda   ) and choosing a basis of every left ideal     Δ  /   J   k  -  1     ⊆    J  k   /   J   k  -  1           normal-Δ   subscript  J    k  1        subscript  J  k    subscript  J    k  1       \Delta/J_{k-1}\subseteq J_{k}/J_{k-1}   one can construct a corresponding cell basis for   A   A   A   .  Examples  Polynomial examples       R   [  x  ]    /   (   x  n   )         R   delimited-[]  x     superscript  x  n     R[x]/(x^{n})   is cellular. A cell datum is given by    i  =   i  d       i    i  d     i=id   and       Λ  :=   {  0  ,  …  ,   n  -  1   }      assign  normal-Λ   0  normal-…    n  1      \Lambda:=\{0,\ldots,n-1\}   with the reverse of the natural ordering.       M   (  λ  )    :=   {  1  }      assign    M  λ    1     M(\lambda):=\{1\}          C  11  λ   :=   x  λ      assign   superscript   subscript  C  11   λ    superscript  x  λ     C_{11}^{\lambda}:=x^{\lambda}      A cell-chain in the sense of the second, abstract definition is given by      0  ⊆   (   x   n  -  1    )   ⊆   (   x   n  -  2    )   ⊆  …  ⊆   (   x  1   )   ⊆   (   x  0   )   =  R        0   superscript  x    n  1          superscript  x    n  2         normal-…        superscript  x  1         superscript  x  0        R     0\subseteq(x^{n-1})\subseteq(x^{n-2})\subseteq\ldots\subseteq(x^{1})\subseteq(%
 x^{0})=R     Matrix examples      R   d  ×  d      superscript  R    d  d     R^{d\times d}   is cellular. A cell datum is given by     i   (  A  )    =   A  T         i  A    superscript  A  T     i(A)=A^{T}   and       Λ  :=   {  1  }      assign  normal-Λ   1     \Lambda:=\{1\}          M   (  1  )    :=   {  1  ,  …  ,  d  }      assign    M  1    1  normal-…  d     M(1):=\{1,\dots,d\}     For the basis one chooses     C   s  t   1   :=   E   s  t       assign   superscript   subscript  C    s  t    1    subscript  E    s  t      C_{st}^{1}:=E_{st}   the standard matrix units, i.e.    C   s  t   1     superscript   subscript  C    s  t    1    C_{st}^{1}   is the matrix with all entries equal to zero except the ( s , t )-th entry which is equal to 1.   A cell-chain (and in fact the only cell chain) is given by      0  ⊆   R   d  ×  d        0   superscript  R    d  d      0\subseteq R^{d\times d}     In some sense all cellular algebras "interpolate" between these two extremes by arranging matrix-algebra-like pieces according to the poset   Λ   normal-Λ   \Lambda   .  Further examples  Modulo minor technicalities all Iwahori–Hecke algebras of finite type are cellular w.r.t. to the involution that maps the standard basis as     T  w   ↦   T   w   -  1        maps-to   subscript  T  w    subscript  T   superscript  w    1       T_{w}\mapsto T_{w^{-1}}   . 6 This includes for example the integral group algebra of the symmetric groups as well as all other finite Weyl groups .  A basic Brauer tree algebra over a field is cellular if and only if the Brauer tree is a straight line (with arbitrary number of exceptional vertices). 7  Further examples include q- Schur algebras , the Brauer algebra , the Temperley–Lieb algebra , the Birman–Murakami–Wenzl algebra , the blocks of the Bernstein–Gelfand–Gelfand category   𝒪   𝒪   \mathcal{O}   of a semisimple Lie algebra . 8  Representations  Cell modules and the invariant bilinear form  Assume   A   A   A   is cellular and    (  Λ  ,  i  ,  M  ,  C  )     normal-Λ  i  M  C    (\Lambda,i,M,C)   is a cell datum for   A   A   A   . Then one defines the cell module     W   (  λ  )       W  λ    W(\lambda)   as the free   R   R   R   -module with basis    {   C  𝔰   |   𝔰  ∈   M   (  λ  )     }     conditional-set   subscript  C  𝔰     𝔰    M  λ      \{C_{\mathfrak{s}}|\mathfrak{s}\in M(\lambda)\}   and multiplication       a   C  𝔰    :=    ∑  𝔲     r  a    (  𝔲  ,  𝔰  )    C  𝔲        assign    a   subscript  C  𝔰      subscript   𝔲      subscript  r  a    𝔲  𝔰    subscript  C  𝔲       aC_{\mathfrak{s}}:=\sum_{\mathfrak{u}}r_{a}(\mathfrak{u},\mathfrak{s})C_{%
 \mathfrak{u}}   where the coefficients     r  a    (  𝔲  ,  𝔰  )        subscript  r  a    𝔲  𝔰     r_{a}(\mathfrak{u},\mathfrak{s})   are the same as above. Then    W   (  λ  )       W  λ    W(\lambda)   becomes an   A   A   A   -left module.  These modules generalize the Specht modules for the symmetric group and the Hecke-algebras of type A.  There is a canonical bilinear form     ϕ  λ   :      W   (  λ  )    ×  W    (  λ  )    →  R      normal-:   subscript  ϕ  λ    normal-→        W  λ   W   λ   R     \phi_{\lambda}:W(\lambda)\times W(\lambda)\to R   which satisfies        C   𝔰  𝔱   λ    C   𝔲  𝔳   λ    ≡     ϕ  λ    (   C  𝔱   ,   C  𝔲   )    C   𝔰  𝔳   λ    mod   A     (    <  λ   )            superscript   subscript  C    𝔰  𝔱    λ    superscript   subscript  C    𝔲  𝔳    λ     modulo     subscript  ϕ  λ     subscript  C  𝔱    subscript  C  𝔲     superscript   subscript  C    𝔰  𝔳    λ     annotated  A    absent  λ       C_{\mathfrak{st}}^{\lambda}C_{\mathfrak{uv}}^{\lambda}\equiv\phi_{\lambda}(C_{%
 \mathfrak{t}},C_{\mathfrak{u}})C_{\mathfrak{sv}}^{\lambda}\mod A(<\lambda)   for all indices     s  ,  t  ,  u  ,  v   ∈   M   (  λ  )         s  t  u  v     M  λ     s,t,u,v\in M(\lambda)   .  One can check that    ϕ  λ     subscript  ϕ  λ    \phi_{\lambda}   is symmetric in the sense that        ϕ  λ    (  x  ,  y  )    =    ϕ  λ    (  y  ,  x  )           subscript  ϕ  λ    x  y       subscript  ϕ  λ    y  x      \phi_{\lambda}(x,y)=\phi_{\lambda}(y,x)   for all     x  ,  y   ∈   W   (  λ  )         x  y     W  λ     x,y\in W(\lambda)   and also   A   A   A   -invariant in the sense that        ϕ  λ    (   i   (  a  )   x   ,  y  )    =    ϕ  λ    (  x  ,   a  y   )           subscript  ϕ  λ      i  a  x   y       subscript  ϕ  λ    x    a  y       \phi_{\lambda}(i(a)x,y)=\phi_{\lambda}(x,ay)   for all    a  ∈  A      a  A    a\in A   ,     x  ,  y   ∈   W   (  λ  )         x  y     W  λ     x,y\in W(\lambda)   .  Simple modules  Assume for the rest of this section that the ring   R   R   R   is a field. With the information contained in the invariant bilinear forms one can easily list all simple   A   A   A   -modules:  Let     Λ  0   :=   {   λ  ∈  Λ   |    ϕ  λ   ≠  0   }      assign   subscript  normal-Λ  0    conditional-set    λ  normal-Λ      subscript  ϕ  λ   0      \Lambda_{0}:=\{\lambda\in\Lambda|\phi_{\lambda}\neq 0\}   and define     L   (  λ  )    :=    W   (  λ  )    /   rad   (   ϕ  λ   )        assign    L  λ       W  λ    rad   subscript  ϕ  λ       L(\lambda):=W(\lambda)/\operatorname{rad}(\phi_{\lambda})   for all    λ  ∈   Λ  0       λ   subscript  normal-Λ  0     \lambda\in\Lambda_{0}   . Then all    L   (  λ  )       L  λ    L(\lambda)   are absolute simple    A   A   A   -modules and every simple   A   A   A   -module is one of these.  These theorems appear already in the original paper by Graham and Lehrer. 9  Properties of cellular algebras  Persistence properties   Tensor products of finitely many cellular   R   R   R   -algebras are cellular.  A   R   R   R   -algebra   A   A   A   is cellular if and only if its opposite algebra     A   o  p      superscript  A    o  p     A^{op}   is.  If   A   A   A   is cellular with cell-datum    (  Λ  ,  i  ,  M  ,  C  )     normal-Λ  i  M  C    (\Lambda,i,M,C)   and    Φ  ⊆  Λ      normal-Φ  normal-Λ    \Phi\subseteq\Lambda   is an ideal (a downward closed subset) of the poset   Λ   normal-Λ   \Lambda   then     A   (  Φ  )    :=   ∑   R   C   𝔰  𝔱   λ        assign    A  normal-Φ       R   superscript   subscript  C    𝔰  𝔱    λ       A(\Phi):=\sum RC_{\mathfrak{st}}^{\lambda}   (where the sum runs over    λ  ∈  Λ      λ  normal-Λ    \lambda\in\Lambda   and     s  ,  t   ∈   M   (  λ  )         s  t     M  λ     s,t\in M(\lambda)   ) is an twosided,   i   i   i   -invariant ideal of   A   A   A   and the quotient     A  /  A    (  Φ  )         A  A   normal-Φ    A/A(\Phi)   is cellular with cell datum    (   Λ  ∖  Φ   ,  i  ,  M  ,  C  )       normal-Λ  normal-Φ   i  M  C    (\Lambda\setminus\Phi,i,M,C)   (where i denotes the induces involution and M,C denote the restricted mappings).  If   A   A   A   is a cellular   R   R   R   -algebra and    R  →  S     normal-→  R  S    R\to S   is a unitary homomorphism of commutative rings, then the extension of scalars     S   ⊗  R   A      subscript  tensor-product  R   S  A    S\otimes_{R}A   is a cellular   S   S   S   -algebra.  Direct products of finitely many cellular   R   R   R   -algebras are cellular.   If   R   R   R   is an integral domain then there is a converse to this last point:   If    (  A  ,  i  )     A  i    (A,i)   is a finite dimensional   R   R   R   -algebra with an involution and    A  =    A  1   ⊕   A  2        A   direct-sum   subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2      A=A_{1}\oplus A_{2}   a decomposition in twosided,   i   i   i   -invariant ideals, then the following are equivalent:        (  A  ,  i  )     A  i    (A,i)   is cellular.      (   A  1   ,  i  )      subscript  A  1   i    (A_{1},i)   and    (   A  2   ,  i  )      subscript  A  2   i    (A_{2},i)   are cellular.    Since in particular all blocks of   A   A   A   are   i   i   i   -invariant if    (  A  ,  i  )     A  i    (A,i)   is cellular, an immediate corollary is that a finite dimensional   R   R   R   -algebra is cellular w.r.t.   i   i   i   if and only if all blocks are   i   i   i   -invariante and cellular w.r.t.   i   i   i   .  Tits' deformation theorem for cellular algebras: Let   A   A   A   be a cellular   R   R   R   -algebra. Also let    R  →  k     normal-→  R  k    R\to k   be a unitary homomorphism into a field   k   k   k   and    K  :=   Q  u  o  t   (  R  )       assign  K    Q  u  o  t  R     K:=Quot(R)   the quotient field of   R   R   R   . Then the following holds: If    k  A      k  A    kA   is semisimple, then    K  A      K  A    KA   is also semisimple.   If one further assumes   R   R   R   to be a local domain , then additionally the following holds:   If   A   A   A   is cellular w.r.t.   i   i   i   and    e  ∈  A      e  A    e\in A   is an idempotent such that     i   (  e  )    =  e        i  e   e    i(e)=e   , then the Algebra    e  A  e      e  A  e    eAe   is cellular.   Other properties  Assuming that   R   R   R   is a field (though a lot of this can be generalized to arbitrary rings, integral domains , local rings or at least discrete valuation rings ) and   A   A   A   is cellular w.r.t. to the involution   i   i   i   . Then the following hold      A   A   A   is split, i.e. all simple modules are absolutely irreducible .  The following are equivalent: 10       A   A   A   is semisimple .     A   A   A   is split semisimple.        ∀  λ   ∈  Λ   :   W   (  λ  )       normal-:     for-all  λ   normal-Λ     W  λ     \forall\lambda\in\Lambda:W(\lambda)   is simple.        ∀  λ   ∈  Λ   :   ϕ  λ      normal-:     for-all  λ   normal-Λ    subscript  ϕ  λ     \forall\lambda\in\Lambda:\phi_{\lambda}   is nondegenerate .    The Cartan matrix     C  A     subscript  C  A    C_{A}   of   A   A   A   is symmetric and positive definite .  The following are equivalent: 11       A   A   A   is quasi-hereditary (i.e. its module category is a highest-weight category ).      Λ  =   Λ  0       normal-Λ   subscript  normal-Λ  0     \Lambda=\Lambda_{0}   .  All cell chains of    (  A  ,  i  )     A  i    (A,i)   have the same length.  All cell chains of    (  A  ,  j  )     A  j    (A,j)   have the same length where    j  :   A  →  A      normal-:  j   normal-→  A  A     j:A\to A   is an arbitrary involution w.r.t. which   A   A   A   is cellular.       det   (   C  A   )    =  1         subscript  C  A    1    \det(C_{A})=1   .    If   A   A   A   is Morita equivalent to   B   B   B   and the characteristic of   R   R   R   is not two, then   B   B   B   is also cellular w.r.t. an suitable involution. In particular is   A   A   A   cellular (to some involution) if and only if its basic algebra is. 12  Every idempotent    e  ∈  A      e  A    e\in A   is equivalent to    i   (  e  )       i  e    i(e)   , i.e.     A  e   ≅   A  i   (  e  )          A  e     A  i  e     Ae\cong Ai(e)   . If     c  h  a  r   (  R  )    ≠  2        c  h  a  r  R   2    char(R)\neq 2   then in fact every equivalence class contains an   i   i   i   -invariant idempotent. 13   References    "  Category:Algebras  Category:Representation theory     ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩  ↩      ↩  ↩
