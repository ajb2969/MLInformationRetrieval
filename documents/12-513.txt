   Conjugate Fourier series      Conjugate Fourier series   In the mathematical field of Fourier analysis , the conjugate Fourier series arises by realizing the Fourier series formally as the boundary values of the real part of a holomorphic function on the unit disc . The imaginary part of that function then defines the conjugate series.  studied the delicate questions of convergence of this series, and its relationship with the Hilbert transform .  In detail, consider a trigonometric series of the form       f   (  θ  )    =      1  2     a  0    +    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    (     a  n    cos   n  θ     +    b  n    sin   n  θ      )           f  θ         1  2    subscript  a  0      superscript   subscript     n  1           subscript  a  n       n  θ        subscript  b  n       n  θ          f(\theta)=\tfrac{1}{2}a_{0}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(a_{n}\cos n\theta+b_{n}%
 \sin n\theta\right)     in which the coefficients a n and b n are real numbers . This series is the real part of the power series       F   (  z  )    =      1  2     a  0    +    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     (    a  n   -   i   b  n     )    z  n            F  z         1  2    subscript  a  0      superscript   subscript     n  1           subscript  a  n     i   subscript  b  n      superscript  z  n        F(z)=\tfrac{1}{2}a_{0}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(a_{n}-ib_{n})z^{n}     along the unit circle with    z  =   e   i  θ        z   superscript  e    i  θ      z=e^{i\theta}   . The imaginary part of F ( z ) is called the conjugate series of f , and is denoted         f  ~    (  θ  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    (     a  n    sin   n  θ     -    b  n    cos   n  θ      )     .         normal-~  f   θ     superscript   subscript     n  1           subscript  a  n       n  θ        subscript  b  n       n  θ         \tilde{f}(\theta)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(a_{n}\sin n\theta-b_{n}\cos n\theta%
