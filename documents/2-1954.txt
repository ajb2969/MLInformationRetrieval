   Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)      Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)   In complex analysis , Liouville's theorem , named after Joseph Liouville , states that every bounded  entire function must be constant. That is, every holomorphic function  f for which there exists a positive number M such that     |   f   (  z  )    |   ≤  M          f  z    M    |f(z)|\leq M   for all   z   z   z   in   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   is constant. Equivalently, holomorphic functions on   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   have dense images.  The theorem is considerably improved by Picard's little theorem , which says that every entire function whose image omits at least two complex numbers must be constant.  Proof  The theorem follows from the fact that holomorphic functions are analytic . If f is an entire function, it can be represented by its Taylor series about 0:       f   (  z  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     a  k    z  k           f  z     superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  a  k    superscript  z  k       f(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}z^{k}     where (by Cauchy's integral formula )       a  k   =     f   (  k  )     (  0  )     k  !    =    1   2  π  i      ∮   C  r        f   (  ζ  )     ζ   k  +  1      d  ζ            subscript  a  k        superscript  f  k   0     k             1    2  π  i      subscript  contour-integral   subscript  C  r          f  ζ    superscript  ζ    k  1     d  ζ        a_{k}=\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}={1\over 2\pi i}\oint_{C_{r}}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta^%

We can estimate directly        |   a  k   |   ≤    1   2  π      ∮   C  r        |   f   (  ζ  )    |     |  ζ  |    k  +  1       |   d  ζ   |      ≤    1   2  π      ∮   C  r       M   r   k  +  1       |   d  ζ   |      =    M   2  π   r   k  +  1        ∮   C  r     |   d  ζ   |     =    M   2  π   r   k  +  1      2  π  r   =   M   r  k     ,           subscript  a  k        1    2  π      subscript  contour-integral   subscript  C  r            f  ζ     superscript    ζ     k  1         d  ζ                1    2  π      subscript  contour-integral   subscript  C  r        M   superscript  r    k  1         d  ζ                M    2  π   superscript  r    k  1        subscript  contour-integral   subscript  C  r        d  ζ               M    2  π   superscript  r    k  1      2  π  r          M   superscript  r  k       |a_{k}|\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\oint_{C_{r}}\frac{|f(\zeta)|}{|\zeta|^{k+1}}\,|d%

 ^{k+1}}\oint_{C_{r}}|d\zeta|=\frac{M}{2\pi r^{k+1}}2\pi r=\frac{M}{r^{k}},     where in the second inequality we have used the fact that | z |= r on the circle C r . But the choice of r in the above is an arbitrary positive number. Therefore, letting r tend to infinity (we let r tend to infinity since f is analytic on the entire plane) gives a k = 0 for all k ≥ 1. Thus f ( z ) = a 0 and this proves the theorem.  Corollaries  Fundamental theorem of algebra  There is a short proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra based upon Liouville's theorem. 1  No entire function dominates another entire function  A consequence of the theorem is that "genuinely different" entire functions cannot dominate each other, i.e. if f and g are entire, and | f | ≤ | g | everywhere, then f = α· g for some complex number α. To show this, consider the function h = f / g . It is enough to prove that h can be extended to an entire function, in which case the result follows by Liouville's theorem. The holomorphy of h is clear except at points in g −1 (0). But since h is bounded and all the zeroes of g are isolated, any singularities must be removable. Thus h can be extended to an entire bounded function which by Liouville's theorem implies it is constant.  If f is less than or equal to a scalar times its input, then it is linear  Suppose that f is entire and | f ( z )| is less than or equal to M | z |, for M a positive real number. We can apply Cauchy's integral formula; we have that       |    f  ′    (  z  )    |   =    1   2  π     |    ∮   C  r       f   (  ζ  )      (   ζ  -  z   )   2    d  ζ    |    ≤    1   2  π      ∮   C  r       |   f   (  ζ  )    |    |    (   ζ  -  z   )   2   |     |   d  ζ   |      ≤    1   2  π      ∮   C  r       M   |  ζ  |     |    (   ζ  -  z   )   2   |     |   d  ζ   |      =    M  I    2  π               superscript  f  normal-′   z        1    2  π        subscript  contour-integral   subscript  C  r          f  ζ    superscript    ζ  z   2    d  ζ               1    2  π      subscript  contour-integral   subscript  C  r            f  ζ       superscript    ζ  z   2         d  ζ                1    2  π      subscript  contour-integral   subscript  C  r          M    ζ       superscript    ζ  z   2         d  ζ                M  I     2  π       |f^{\prime}(z)|=\frac{1}{2\pi}\left|\oint_{C_{r}}\frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta-z)^{2}%

 \frac{MI}{2\pi}     where I is the value of the remaining integral. This shows that f ' is bounded and entire, so it must be constant, by Liouville's theorem. Integrating then shows that f is affine and then, by referring back to the original inequality, we have that the constant term is zero.  Non-constant elliptic functions cannot be defined on C  The theorem can also be used to deduce that the domain of a non-constant elliptic function  f cannot be C . Suppose it was. Then, if a and b are two periods of f such that a ⁄ b is not real, consider the parallelogram  P whose vertices are 0, a , b and a + b . Then the image of f is equal to f ( P ). Since f is continuous and P is compact , f ( P ) is also compact and, therefore, it is bounded. So, f is constant.  The fact that the domain of a non-constant elliptic function f can not be C is what Liouville actually proved, in 1847, using the theory of elliptic functions. 2 In fact, it was Cauchy who proved Liouville's theorem. 3 4  Entire functions have dense images  If f is a non-constant entire function, then its image is dense in C . This might seem to be a much stronger result than Liouville's theorem, but it is actually an easy corollary. If the image of f is not dense, then there is a complex number w and a real number r > 0 such that the open disk centered at w with radius r has no element of the image of f . Define g ( z ) = 1/( f ( z ) − w ). Then g is a bounded entire function, since       (  ∀  z  ∈  ℂ  )   :  |  g   (  z  )   |  =   1   |    f   (  z  )    -  w   |    <   1  r   ⋅     fragments   fragments  normal-(  for-all  z   C  normal-)   normal-:  normal-|  g   fragments  normal-(  z  normal-)   normal-|     1        f  z   w        1  r   normal-⋅    (\forall z\in\mathbb{C}):|g(z)|=\frac{1}{|f(z)-w|}<\frac{1}{r}\cdot   So, g is constant, and therefore f is constant.  Remarks  Let C ∪ {∞} be the one point compactification of the complex plane C . In place of holomorphic functions defined on regions in C , one can consider regions in C ∪ {∞}. Viewed this way, the only possible singularity for entire functions, defined on C ⊂ C ∪ {∞}, is the point ∞. If an entire function f is bounded in a neighborhood of ∞, then ∞ is a removable singularity of f , i.e. f cannot blow up or behave erratically at ∞. In light of the power series expansion, it is not surprising that Liouville's theorem holds.  Similarly, if an entire function has a pole at ∞, i.e. blows up like z n in some neighborhood of ∞, then f is a polynomial. This extended version of Liouville's theorem can be more precisely stated: if | f ( z )| ≤ M .| z n | for | z | sufficiently large, then f is a polynomial of degree at most n . This can be proved as follows. Again take the Taylor series representation of f ,        f   (  z  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     a  k    z  k      .        f  z     superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  a  k    superscript  z  k       f(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}z^{k}.     The argument used during the proof using Cauchy estimates shows that       (  ∀  k  ∈  ℕ  )   :  |   a  k   |  ⩽  M   r   n  -  k    .     fragments   fragments  normal-(  for-all  k   N  normal-)   normal-:  normal-|   subscript  a  k   normal-|   M   superscript  r    n  k    normal-.    (\forall k\in\mathbb{N}):|a_{k}|\leqslant Mr^{n-k}.   So, if k > n ,       |   a  k   |   ⩽    lim   r  →   +  ∞      M   r   n  -  k      =  0.           subscript  a  k      subscript    normal-→  r          M   superscript  r    n  k           0.     |a_{k}|\leqslant\lim_{r\rightarrow+\infty}Mr^{n-k}=0.   Therefore, a k = 0.  Liouville's theorem does not extend to the generalizations of complex numbers known as double numbers and dual numbers . 5  See also   Mittag-Leffler's theorem   References    External links     Module for Liouville’s Theorem by John H.
