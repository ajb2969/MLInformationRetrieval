Pairing function

In mathematics a pairing function is a process to uniquely encode two natural numbers into a single natural number.
Any pairing function can be used in set theory to prove that integers and rational numbers have the same cardinality as natural numbers. In theoretical computer science they are used to encode a function defined on a vector of natural numbers f:Nk → N into a new function g:N → N.
Definition
A pairing function is a primitive recursive bijection

The Cantor pairing function assigns one natural number to each pair of natural numbers

The Cantor pairing function is a pairing function


 
  defined by



When we apply the pairing function to 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  we often denote the resulting number as 
 
 

This definition can be inductively generalized to the Cantor tuple function


 
  as



Inverting the Cantor pairing function
Let 
 
 
 
 
  be arbitary and suppose that 
 
 
 
 . We will show that there exist unique values 
 
 
 
  such that



and hence that 
 
 
 
  is invertible. It is helpful to define some intermediate values in the calculation:









where t is the triangle number of w. If we solve the quadratic equation



for w as a function of t, we get



which is a strictly increasing and continuous function when t is non-negative real. Since



we get that



and thus


 
 . where 
 
 
 
  is the floor function. So to calculate x and y from z, we do:











 
 .
Since the Cantor pairing function is invertible, it must be one-to-one and onto.
