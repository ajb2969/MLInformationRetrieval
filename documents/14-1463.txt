Eisenstein integral

In mathematical representation theory, the Eisenstein integral is an integral introduced by  in the representation theory of semisimple Lie groups, analogous to Eisenstein series in the theory of automorphic forms.  used Eisenstein integrals to decompose the regular representation of a semisimple Lie group into representations induced from parabolic subgroups.  gave a survey of Harish-Chandra's work on this.
Definition
defined the Eisenstein integral by


 
  where:

x is an element of a semisimple group G
P = MAN is a cuspidal parabolic subgroup of G
ν is an element of the complexification of a
a is the Lie algebra of A in the Langlands decomposition P = MAN.
K is a maximal compact subgroup of G, with G = KP.
ψ is a cuspidal function on M, satisfying some extra conditions
τ is a finite-dimensional unitary double representation of K
HP(x) = log a where x = kman is the decomposition of x in G = KMAN.
