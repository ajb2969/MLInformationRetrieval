   Eisenstein integral      Eisenstein integral   In mathematical representation theory , the Eisenstein integral is an integral introduced by  in the representation theory of semisimple Lie groups , analogous to Eisenstein series in the theory of automorphic forms .  used Eisenstein integrals to decompose the regular representation of a semisimple Lie group into representations induced from parabolic subgroups.  gave a survey of Harish-Chandra's work on this.  Definition  defined the Eisenstein integral by      E   (  P  :  ψ  :  ν  :  x  )   =   ∫  K   ψ   (  x  k  )   τ   (   k   -  1    )   exp   (   (  i  ν  -   ρ  P   )    H  P    (  x  k  )   )   d  k     fragments  E   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-:  ψ  normal-:  ν  normal-:  x  normal-)     subscript   K   ψ   fragments  normal-(  x  k  normal-)   τ   fragments  normal-(   superscript  k    1    normal-)     fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(  i  ν    subscript  ρ  P   normal-)    subscript  H  P    fragments  normal-(  x  k  normal-)   normal-)   d  k    \displaystyle E(P:\psi:\nu:x)=\int_{K}\psi(xk)\tau(k^{-1})\exp((i\nu-\rho_{P})%
