   Schauder basis      Schauder basis   In mathematics , a Schauder basis or countable basis is similar to the usual ( Hamel ) basis of a vector space ; the difference is that Hamel bases use linear combinations that are finite sums, while for Schauder bases they may be infinite sums. This makes Schauder bases more suitable for the analysis of infinite-dimensional topological vector spaces including Banach spaces .  Schauder bases were described by Juliusz Schauder in 1927, 1 2 although such bases were discussed earlier. For example, the Haar basis was given in 1909, and G. Faber discussed in 1910 a basis for continuous functions on an interval, sometimes called a Faber–Schauder system . 3  Definitions  Let V denote a Banach space over the field  F . A Schauder basis is a sequence { b n } of elements of V such that for every element  there exists a unique sequence {α n } of scalars in F so that       v  =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     α  n    b  n      ,      v    superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  α  n    subscript  b  n       v=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\alpha_{n}b_{n},     where the convergence is understood with respect to the norm topology, i.e. ,        lim   n  →  ∞      ∥   v  -    ∑   k  =  0   n     α  k    b  k      ∥   V    =  0.        subscript    normal-→  n      subscript   norm    v    superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  α  k    subscript  b  k       V    0.    \lim_{n\to\infty}\left\|v-\sum_{k=0}^{n}\alpha_{k}b_{k}\right\|_{V}=0.     Schauder bases can also be defined analogously in a general topological vector space . As opposed to a Hamel basis , the elements of the basis must be ordered since the series may not converge unconditionally .  A Schauder basis { b n } is said to be normalized when all the basis vectors have norm 1 in the Banach space V .  A sequence { x n } in V is a basic sequence if it is a Schauder basis of its closed linear span .  Two Schauder bases, { b n } in V and { c n } in W , are said to be equivalent if there exist two constants  and C such that for every integer  and all sequences {α n } of scalars,        c    ∥    ∑   k  =  0   N     α  k    b  k     ∥   V    ≤    ∥    ∑   k  =  0   N     α  k    c  k     ∥   W   ≤   C    ∥    ∑   k  =  0   N     α  k    b  k     ∥   V     .          c   subscript   norm    superscript   subscript     k  0    N      subscript  α  k    subscript  b  k      V     subscript   norm    superscript   subscript     k  0    N      subscript  α  k    subscript  c  k      W          C   subscript   norm    superscript   subscript     k  0    N      subscript  α  k    subscript  b  k      V       c\left\|\sum_{k=0}^{N}\alpha_{k}b_{k}\right\|_{V}\leq\left\|\sum_{k=0}^{N}%

 {V}.     A family of vectors in V is total if its linear span (the set of finite linear combinations) is dense in V . If V is a Hilbert space , an orthogonal basis is a total subset B of V such that elements in B are nonzero and pairwise orthogonal. Further, when each element in B has norm 1, then B is an orthonormal basis of V .  Properties  Let { b n } be a Schauder basis of a Banach space V over F = R or C . It follows from the Banach–Steinhaus theorem that the linear mappings { P n } defined by       v  =     ∑   k  =  0   ∞     α  k    b  k      ⟶   P  n         P  n    (  v  )    =     ∑   k  =  0   n      α  k    b  k         formulae-sequence    v     superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  α  k    subscript  b  k       subscript  P  n   normal-⟶          subscript  P  n   v     superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  α  k    subscript  b  k        v=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\alpha_{k}b_{k}\ \ \overset{\textstyle P_{n}}{%
 \longrightarrow}\ \ P_{n}(v)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\alpha_{k}b_{k}     are uniformly bounded by some constant C . When , the basis is called a monotone basis. The maps { P n } are the basis projections .  Let { b* n } denote the coordinate functionals , where b* n assigns to every vector v in V the coordinate α n of v in the above expansion. Each b* n is a bounded linear functional on V . Indeed, for every vector v in V ,         |    b  n  *    (  v  )    |     ∥   b  n   ∥   V    =    |   α  n   |     ∥   b  n   ∥   V    =    ∥    α  n    b  n    ∥   V   =    ∥     P  n    (  v  )    -    P   n  -  1     (  v  )     ∥   V   ≤   2  C    ∥  v  ∥   V     .               subscript   superscript  b    n   v     subscript   norm   subscript  b  n    V         subscript  α  n     subscript   norm   subscript  b  n    V          subscript   norm     subscript  α  n    subscript  b  n     V         subscript   norm       subscript  P  n   v      subscript  P    n  1    v     V          2  C   subscript   norm  v   V       |b^{*}_{n}(v)|\;\|b_{n}\|_{V}=|\alpha_{n}|\;\|b_{n}\|_{V}=\|\alpha_{n}b_{n}\|_%
 {V}=\|P_{n}(v)-P_{n-1}(v)\|_{V}\leq 2C\|v\|_{V}.     These functionals { b* n } are called biorthogonal functionals associated to the basis { b n }. When the basis { b n } is normalized, the coordinate functionals { b* n } have norm ≤ 2 C in the continuous dual of V .  A Banach space with a Schauder basis is necessarily separable , but the converse is false, as described below. Since every vector v in a Banach space V with a Schauder basis is the limit of P n ( v ), with P n of finite rank and uniformly bounded, such a space V satisfies the bounded approximation property .  A theorem attributed to Mazur 4 asserts that every infinite-dimensional Banach space V contains a basic sequence, i.e. , there is an infinite-dimensional subspace of V that has a Schauder basis. The basis problem is the question asked by Banach, whether every separable Banach space has a Schauder basis. This was negatively answered by Per Enflo who constructed a separable Banach space failing the approximation property, thus a space without a Schauder basis. 5  Examples  The standard unit vector bases of c 0 , and of ℓ p for 1 ≤ p n''}, the vector b n in  c 0 }} or in ℓ p }} is the scalar sequence where all coordinates b n, j are 0, except the n th coordinate:         b  n   =    {   b   n  ,  j    }    j  =  0   ∞   ∈  V   ,    b   n  ,  j    =   δ   n  ,  j      ,     formulae-sequence       subscript  b  n    superscript   subscript    subscript  b   n  j       j  0           V       subscript  b   n  j     subscript  δ   n  j       b_{n}=\{b_{n,j}\}_{j=0}^{\infty}\in V,\ \ b_{n,j}=\delta_{n,j},   where δ n, j is the Kronecker delta . The space ℓ ∞ is not separable, and therefore has no Schauder basis.  Every orthonormal basis in a separable Hilbert space is a Schauder basis. Every countable orthonormal basis is equivalent to the standard unit vector basis in ℓ 2 .  The Haar system is an example of a basis for [[Lp space| L p ([0, 1])]], when 1 ≤ p When , another example is the trigonometric system defined below. The Banach space C ([0, 1]) of continuous functions on the interval [0, 1], with the supremum norm , admits a Schauder basis. The Faber–Schauder system is the most commonly used Schauder basis for C ([0, 1]). 6 7  Several bases for classical spaces were discovered before Banach's book appeared (), but some other cases remained open for a long time. For example, the question of whether the disk algebra  A ( D ) has a Schauder basis remained open for more than forty years, until Bočkarev showed in 1974 that a basis constructed from the Franklin system exists in A ( D ). 8 One can also prove that the periodic Franklin system 9 is a basis for a Banach space A r isomorphic to A ( D ). 10 This space A r consists of all complex continuous functions on the unit circle T whose conjugate function is also continuous. The Franklin system is another Schauder basis for C ([0, 1]), 11 and it is a Schauder basis in L p ([0, 1]) when . 12 Systems derived from the Franklin system give bases in the space C 1 ([0, 1] 2 ) of differentiable functions on the unit square. 13 The existence of a Schauder basis in C 1 ([0, 1] 2 ) was a question from Banach's book. 14  Relation to Fourier series  Let { x n } be, in the real case, the sequence of functions      {  1  ,   cos   (  x  )    ,   sin   (  x  )    ,   cos   (   2  x   )    ,   sin   (   2  x   )    ,   cos   (   3  x   )    ,   sin   (   3  x   )    ,  …  }     1    x     x       2  x        2  x        3  x        3  x    normal-…    \{1,\cos(x),\sin(x),\cos(2x),\sin(2x),\cos(3x),\sin(3x),\ldots\}     or, in the complex case,       {  1  ,   e   i  x    ,   e   -   i  x     ,   e   2  i  x    ,   e   -   2  i  x     ,   e   3  i  x    ,   e   -   3  i  x     ,  …  }   .     1   superscript  e    i  x     superscript  e      i  x      superscript  e    2  i  x     superscript  e      2  i  x      superscript  e    3  i  x     superscript  e      3  i  x     normal-…    \left\{1,e^{ix},e^{-ix},e^{2ix},e^{-2ix},e^{3ix},e^{-3ix},\ldots\right\}.     The sequence { x n } is called the trigonometric system . It is a Schauder basis for the space [[Lp space| L p ([0, 2 π ])]] for any p such that . For p = 2, this is the content of the Riesz–Fischer theorem , and for p ≠ 2, it is a consequence of the boundedness on the space L p ([0, 2 π ]) of the Hilbert transform on the circle . It follows from this boundedness that the projections P N defined by       {  f  :   x  →    ∑   k  =   -  ∞     +  ∞      c  k    e   i  k  x       }     ⟶   P  N      {    P  N   f   :   x  →    ∑   k  =   -  N    N     c  k    e   i  k  x       }        conditional-set  f   normal-→  x    superscript   subscript     k                subscript  c  k    superscript  e    i  k  x          subscript  P  N   normal-⟶    conditional-set     subscript  P  N   f    normal-→  x    superscript   subscript     k    N     N      subscript  c  k    superscript  e    i  k  x          \left\{f:x\to\sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty}c_{k}e^{ikx}\right\}\ \overset{P_{N}}{%
 \longrightarrow}\ \left\{P_{N}f:x\to\sum_{k=-N}^{N}c_{k}e^{ikx}\right\}     are uniformly bounded on L p ([0, 2 π ]) when . This family of maps { P N } is equicontinuous and tends to the identity on the dense subset consisting of trigonometric polynomials . It follows that P N  f tends to f in L p -norm for every . In other words, { x n } is a Schauder basis of L p ([0, 2 π ]). 15  However, the set { x n } is not a Schauder basis for L 1 ([0, 2 π ]). This means that there are functions in L 1 whose Fourier series does not converge in the L 1 norm, or equivalently, that the projections P N are not uniformly bounded in L 1 -norm. Also, the set { x n } is not a Schauder basis for C ([0, 2 π ]).  Bases for spaces of operators  The space K (ℓ 2 ) of compact operators on the Hilbert space ℓ 2 has a Schauder basis. For every x , y in ℓ 2 , let  denote the rank one operator . If  is the standard orthonormal basis of ℓ 2 , a basis for K (ℓ 2 ) is given by the sequence 16         e  1   ⊗   e  1    ,    e  1   ⊗   e  2    ,    e  2   ⊗   e  2    ,    e  2   ⊗   e  1    ,  …   ,      tensor-product   subscript  e  1    subscript  e  1     tensor-product   subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2     tensor-product   subscript  e  2    subscript  e  2     tensor-product   subscript  e  2    subscript  e  1    normal-…    \displaystyle e_{1}\otimes e_{1},\ \ e_{1}\otimes e_{2},\;e_{2}\otimes e_{2},%
 \;e_{2}\otimes e_{1},\ldots,     For every n , the sequence consisting of the n 2 first vectors in this basis is a suitable ordering of the family { e j ⊗ e k }, for .  The preceding result can be generalized: a Banach space X with a basis has the approximation property , so the space K ( X ) of compact operators on X is isometrically isomorphic 17 to the injective tensor product         X  ′     ⊗  ^   ε   X   ≃   𝒦   (  X  )     .     similar-to-or-equals     superscript  X  normal-′    subscript   normal-^  tensor-product   ε   X     𝒦  X     X^{\prime}\widehat{\otimes}_{\varepsilon}X\simeq\mathcal{K}(X).     If X is a Banach space with a Schauder basis  such that the biorthogonal functionals are a basis of the dual, that is to say, a Banach space with a shrinking basis , then the space K ( X ) admits a basis formed by the rank one operators , with the same ordering as before. 18 This applies in particular to every reflexive Banach space X with a Schauder basis  On the other hand, the space B (ℓ 2 ) has no basis, since it is non-separable. Moreover, B (ℓ 2 ) does not have the approximation property. 19  Unconditionality  A Schauder basis { b n } is unconditional if whenever the series    ∑    α  n    b  n           subscript  α  n    subscript  b  n      \sum\alpha_{n}b_{n}   converges, it converges unconditionally . For a Schauder basis { b n }, this is equivalent to the existence of a constant C such that        ∥    ∑   k  =  0   n     ε  k    α  k    b  k     ∥   V   ≤   C    ∥    ∑   k  =  0   n     α  k    b  k     ∥   V         subscript   norm    superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  ε  k    subscript  α  k    subscript  b  k      V     C   subscript   norm    superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  α  k    subscript  b  k      V      \Bigl\|\sum_{k=0}^{n}\varepsilon_{k}\alpha_{k}b_{k}\Bigr\|_{V}\leq C\Bigl\|%
 \sum_{k=0}^{n}\alpha_{k}b_{k}\Bigr\|_{V}     for all integers n , all scalar coefficients {α k } and all signs ± 1}} . Unconditionality is an important property since it allows one to forget about the order of summation. A Schauder basis is symmetric if it is unconditional and uniformly equivalent to all its permutations: there exists a constant C such that for every integer n , every permutation π of the integers , all scalar coefficients {α k } and all signs {ε k },         ∥    ∑   k  =  0   n     ε  k    α  k    b   π   (  k  )       ∥   V   ≤   C    ∥    ∑   k  =  0   n     α  k    b  k     ∥   V     .       subscript   norm    superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  ε  k    subscript  α  k    subscript  b    π  k       V     C   subscript   norm    superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  α  k    subscript  b  k      V      \Bigl\|\sum_{k=0}^{n}\varepsilon_{k}\alpha_{k}b_{\pi(k)}\Bigr\|_{V}\leq C\Bigl%
 \|\sum_{k=0}^{n}\alpha_{k}b_{k}\Bigr\|_{V}.     The standard bases of the sequence spaces  c 0 and ℓ p for 1 ≤ p p'', except for p = 2.  The Haar system is an unconditional basis in L p for any 1 1([0, 1]) has no unconditional basis. 20  A natural question is whether every infinite-dimensional Banach space has an infinite-dimensional subspace with an unconditional basis. This was solved negatively by Timothy Gowers and Bernard Maurey in 1992. 21  Schauder bases and duality  A basis { e n } n ≥0 of a Banach space X is boundedly complete if for every sequence { a n } n ≥0 of scalars such that the partial sums       V  n   =    ∑   k  =  0   n     a  k    e  k          subscript  V  n     superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  a  k    subscript  e  k       V_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_{k}e_{k}     are bounded in X , the sequence { V n } converges in X . The unit vector basis for ℓ p , , is boundedly complete. However, the unit vector basis is not boundedly complete in c 0 . Indeed, if a n = 1 for every n , then        ∥   V  n   ∥    c  0    =    max   0  ≤  k  ≤  n     |   a  k   |    =  1         subscript   norm   subscript  V  n     subscript  c  0      subscript       0  k       n        subscript  a  k          1     \|V_{n}\|_{c_{0}}=\max_{0\leq k\leq n}|a_{k}|=1     for every n , but the sequence { V n } is not convergent in c 0 , since || V n +1 − V n || = 1 for every n .  A space X with a boundedly complete basis { e n } n ≥0 is isomorphic to a dual space, namely, the space X is isomorphic to the dual of the closed linear span in the dual  of the biorthogonal functionals associated to the basis { e n }. 22  A basis { e n } n ≥0 of X is shrinking if for every bounded linear functional f on X , the sequence of non-negative numbers       φ  n   =   sup   {   |   f   (  x  )    |   :    x  ∈   F  n    ,    ∥  x  ∥   ≤  1    }         subscript  φ  n    supremum   conditional-set      f  x     formulae-sequence    x   subscript  F  n       norm  x   1        \varphi_{n}=\sup\{|f(x)|:x\in F_{n},\;\|x\|\leq 1\}   tends to 0 when , where F n is the linear span of the basis vectors e m for m ≥ n . The unit vector basis for ℓ p , 1 0, is shrinking. It is not shrinking in ℓ 1 : if f is the bounded linear functional on ℓ 1 given by       f  :   x  =   {   x  n   }   ∈    ℓ  1    →    ∑   n  =  0   ∞    x  n      ,     normal-:  f      x    subscript  x  n          superscript  normal-ℓ  1     normal-→      superscript   subscript     n  0       subscript  x  n        f:x=\{x_{n}\}\in\ell^{1}\ \rightarrow\ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}x_{n},   then 1}} for every n .  A basis of X is shrinking if and only if the biorthogonal functionals form a basis of the dual . 23  Robert C. James characterized reflexivity in Banach spaces with basis: the space X with a Schauder basis is reflexive if and only if the basis is both shrinking and boundedly complete. 24 James also proved that a space with an unconditional basis is non-reflexive if and only if it contains a subspace isomorphic to c 0 or ℓ 1 . 25  Related concepts  A Hamel basis is a subset B of a vector space V such that every element v ∈ V can uniquely be written as      v  =    ∑   b  ∈  B      α  b   b        v    subscript     b  B       subscript  α  b   b      v=\sum_{b\in B}\alpha_{b}b     with α b ∈ F , with the extra condition that the set      {   b  ∈  B   ∣    α  b   ≠  0   }     conditional-set    b  B      subscript  α  b   0     \{b\in B\mid\alpha_{b}\neq 0\}     is finite. This property makes the Hamel basis unwieldy for infinite-dimensional Banach spaces; as a Hamel basis for an infinite-dimensional Banach space has to be uncountable . (Every finite-dimensional subspace of an infinite-dimensional Banach space X has empty interior, and is no-where dense in X . It then follows from the Baire category theorem that a countable union of these finite-dimensional subspaces cannot serve as a basis. 26 )  See also   Generalized Fourier series  Orthogonal polynomials  Haar wavelet  Banach space   Notes    References    .   .   .   .   .   .    .    .
