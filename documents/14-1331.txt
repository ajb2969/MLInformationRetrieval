Exponentially closed field

In mathematics, an exponentially closed field is an ordered field

 
  which has an order preserving isomorphism

 
  of the additive group of 
 
 
 
  onto the multiplicative group of positive elements of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
Isomorphism 
 
 
 
  is called an exponential function in 
 
 
 
 .
Examples

The canonical example for an exponentially closed field is the ordered field of real numbers; here 
 
 
 
  can be any function 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 .

Properties

Every exponentially closed field 
 
 
 
  is root-closed, i.e., every positive element of 
 
 
 
  has an 
 
 
 
 -th root for all positive integer 
 
 
 
  (or in other words the multiplicative group of positive elements of 
 
 
 
  is divisible). This is so because 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
Consequently, every exponentially closed field is an Euclidean field.
Consequently, every exponentially closed field is an ordered Pythagorean field.
Not every real-closed field is an exponentially closed field, e.g., the field of real algebraic numbers is not exponentially closed. This is so because 
 
 
 
  has to be 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
  of the real numbers; and 
 
 
 
  is not algebraic if 
Consequently, the class of exponentially closed fields is not an elementary class since the field of real numbers and the field of real algebraic numbers are elementarily equivalent structures.
The class of exponentially closed fields is a pseudoelementary class. This is so since a field 
 
 
 
  is exponentially closed iff there is a surjective function 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and $E_2(1)=2$; and these properties of $E_2\,$ are axiomatizable.
