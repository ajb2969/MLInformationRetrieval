   Cob(II)alamin reductase      Cob(II)alamin reductase   In enzymology , a cob(II)alamin reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 cob(I)alamin + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 cob(II)alamin + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cob(I)alamin and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are cob(II)alamin , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those oxidizing metal ion with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cob(I)alamin:NAD+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include vitamin B12r reductase , B12r reductase , and NADH2:cob(II)alamin oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism . It employs one cofactor , FAD .
