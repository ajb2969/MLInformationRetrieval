   Phycoerythrobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase      Phycoerythrobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase   In enzymology , a phycoerythrobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (3Z)-phycoerythrobilin + oxidized ferredoxin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   15,16-dihydrobiliverdin + reduced ferredoxin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (3Z)-phycoerythrobilin and oxidized ferredoxin , whereas its two products are 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin and reduced ferredoxin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with an iron-sulfur protein as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (3Z)-phycoerythrobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called PebB . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.
