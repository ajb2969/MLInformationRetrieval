   End-to-end vector      End-to-end vector   In the physical chemistry study of polymers , the end-to-end vector is the vector that points from one end of a polymer to the other end.  The norm of the end-to-end vector is called the end-to-end distance .  The quadratic mean of the end-to-end distance 2  > can be related to the quadratic mean of the radius of gyration  2 > of a polymer by the relation: 1   2 > = 6 2 >   Notes    See also   Freely Jointed Chain  Worm-like chain   "  Category:Polymers  Category:Polymer physics     â†©
