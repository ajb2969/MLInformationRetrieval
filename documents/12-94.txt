Support of a module

In commutative algebra, the support of a module M over a commutative ring A is the set of all prime ideals

 
  of A such that 
 
 
 
 .1 It is denoted by 
 
 
 
 . In particular, 
 
 
 
  if and only if its support is empty.

Let 
 
 
 
  be an exact sequence of A-modules. Then
 
 


If 
 
 
 
  is a sum of submodules 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 

If 
 
 
 
  is a finitely generated A-module, then 
 
 
 
  is the set of all prime ideals containing the annihilator of M. In particular, it is closed.
If 
 
 
 
  are finitely generated A-modules, then
 
 


If 
 
 
 
  is a finitely generated A-module and I is an ideal of A, then 
 
 
 
  is the set of all prime ideals containing 
 
 
 
  This is
