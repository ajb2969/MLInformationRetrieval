   2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphatase      2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphatase   In enzymology , a 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-deoxy-D-glucose + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 2-deoxy-D-glucose and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-deoxy-D-glucose-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase . This enzyme is also called 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate phosphatase .  References      "  Category:EC 3.1.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
