   Demethylsterigmatocystin 6-O-methyltransferase      Demethylsterigmatocystin 6-O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a demethylsterigmatocystin 6-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 6-demethylsterigmatocystin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + sterigmatocystin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 6-demethylsterigmatocystin , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and sterigmatocystin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:6-demethylsterigmatocystin 6-O-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include demethylsterigmatocystin methyltransferase , and O-methyltransferase I .  References     "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
