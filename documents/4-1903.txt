   Elongated pentagonal cupola      Elongated pentagonal cupola   In geometry , the elongated pentagonal cupola is one of the Johnson solids ( J 20 ). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a pentagonal cupola ( J 5 ) by attaching a decagonal prism to its base. The solid can also be seen as an elongated pentagonal orthobicupola ( J 38 ) with its "lid" (another pentagonal cupola ) removed.  Formulas  The following formulas for the volume and surface area can be used if all faces are regular , with edge length a : 1     V  =    (    1  6    (   5  +   4   5    +   15    5  +   2   5        )    )    a  3    ≈   10.0183...   a  3          V        1  6     5    4    5      15      5    2    5          superscript  a  3           10.0183...   superscript  a  3       V=(\frac{1}{6}(5+4\sqrt{5}+15\sqrt{5+2\sqrt{5}}))a^{3}\approx 10.0183...a^{3}       A  =    (    1  4    (   60  +    10   (   80  +   31   5    +    2175  +   930   5       )      )    )    a  2    ≈   26.5797...   a  2          A        1  4     60      10    80    31    5        2175    930    5            superscript  a  2           26.5797...   superscript  a  2       A=(\frac{1}{4}(60+\sqrt{10(80+31\sqrt{5}+\sqrt{2175+930\sqrt{5}})}))a^{2}%
