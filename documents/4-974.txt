   Poisson supermanifold      Poisson supermanifold   In differential geometry a Poisson supermanifold is a differential supermanifold M such that the supercommutative algebra of smooth functions over it (to clarify this: M is not a point set space and so, doesn't "really" exist, and really, this algebra is all we have),     C  âˆž    (  M  )        superscript  C    M    C^{\infty}(M)   is equipped with a bilinear map called the Poisson superbracket turning it into a Poisson superalgebra .  Every symplectic supermanifold is a Poisson supermanifold but not vice versa.  See also   Poisson manifold  Poisson algebra  Noncommutative geometry   "  Category:Symplectic geometry
