EMS Prize (1992) }} Gábor Tardos (born 11 July 1964) is a Hungarianmathematician, currently a professor and Canada Research Chair at Simon Fraser University. He works mainly in combinatorics and computer science. He is the younger brother of Éva Tardos.1
Mathematical results
Tardos started with a result in universal algebra: he exhibited a maximal clone of monotone operations which is not finitely generated. He obtained partial results concerning the Hanna Neumann conjecture. With his student, Adam Marcus, he proved a combinatorial conjecture of Zoltán Füredi and Péter Hajnal which was known to imply the Stanley–Wilf conjecture. With topological methods he proved that if 
 
 
 
  is a finite set system consisting of the unions of intervals on two disjoint lines, then 
 
 
 
  holds, where 
 
 
 
  is the least number of points covering all elements of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the size of the largest disjoint subsystem of 
 
 
 
 . Tardos worked out a method for optimal probabilistic fingerprint codes. Although the mathematical content is hard, the algorithm is easy to implement.
Awards
He received the European Mathematical Society prize for young researchers at the European Congress of Mathematics in 1992 and the Erdős Prize from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 2000. He received a Lendület Grant from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (2009).2 specifically devised to keep outstanding researchers in Hungary.
