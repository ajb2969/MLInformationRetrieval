   Klein quadric      Klein quadric   In mathematics , the lines of a 3-dimensional projective space , S , can be viewed as points of a 5-dimensional projective space, T . In that 5-space, the points that represent each line in S lie on a hyperbolic quadric , Q known as the Klein quadric .  If the underlying vector space of S is the 4-dimensional vector space V , then T has as the underlying vector space the 6-dimensional exterior square Λ 2 V of V . The line coordinates obtained this way are known as Plücker coordinates .  These Plücker coordinates satisfy the quadratic relation         p  12    p  34    +    p  13    p  42    +    p  14    p  23     =  0           subscript  p  12    subscript  p  34       subscript  p  13    subscript  p  42       subscript  p  14    subscript  p  23     0    p_{12}p_{34}+p_{13}p_{42}+p_{14}p_{23}=0   defining Q , where       p   i  j    =     u  i    v  j    -    u  j    v  i          subscript  p    i  j         subscript  u  i    subscript  v  j       subscript  u  j    subscript  v  i       p_{ij}=u_{i}v_{j}-u_{j}v_{i}   are the coordinates of the line spanned by the two vectors u and v .  The 3-space, S , can be reconstructed again from the quadric, Q : the planes contained in Q fall into two equivalence classes , where planes in the same class meet in a point, and planes in different classes meet in a line or in the empty set. Let these classes be   C   C   C   and    C  ′     superscript  C  normal-′    C^{\prime}   . The geometry of S is retrieved as follows:   The points of S are the planes in C .  The lines of S are the points of Q .  The planes of S are the planes in C ’.   The fact that the geometries of S and Q are isomorphic can be explained by the isomorphism of the Dynkin diagrams  A 3 and D 3 .  References    .
