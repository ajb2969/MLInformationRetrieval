   Methylamine-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase      Methylamine-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase   Methylamine-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase (, mtmB (gene) , monomethylamine methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name monomethylamine:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide Co-methyltransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   methylamine + [Co(I) methylamine-specific corrinoid protein]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   [methyl-Co(III) methylamine-specific corrinoid protein] + ammonia    This enzyme is involved in methanogenesis from methylamine.
