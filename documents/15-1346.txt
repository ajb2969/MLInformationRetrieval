Methylamine-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase

Methylamine-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase (, mtmB (gene), monomethylamine methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name monomethylamine:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide Co-methyltransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

methylamine + [Co(I) methylamine-specific corrinoid protein] 
 
 
 
  [methyl-Co(III) methylamine-specific corrinoid protein] + ammonia


This enzyme is involved in methanogenesis from methylamine.
