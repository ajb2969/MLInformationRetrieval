NADPH—cytochrome-c2 reductase

In enzymology, a NADPH—cytochrome-c2 reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

NADPH + 2 ferricytochrome c2

 
  NADP+ + H+ + 2 ferrocytochrome c2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are NADPH and ferricytochrome c2, whereas its 3 products are NADP+, H+, and ferrocytochrome c2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on NADH or NADPH with a heme protein as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is NADPH:ferricytochrome-c2 oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include cytochrome c2 reductase (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, phosphate), cytochrome c2 reductase (reduced nicotinamide adinine dinucleotide, and phosphate, NADPH). It employs one cofactor, FAD.
