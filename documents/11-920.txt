   Glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase      Glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase   In enzymology , a glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acyl-CoA + sn-glycerol 3-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + 1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and sn-glycerol 3-phosphate , whereas its two products are CoA and 1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:sn-glycerol-3-phosphate 1-O-acyltransferase . Other names in common use include alpha-glycerophosphate acyltransferase , 3-glycerophosphate acyltransferase , ACP:sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase , glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase , glycerol phosphate acyltransferase , glycerol phosphate transacylase , glycerophosphate acyltransferase , glycerophosphate transacylase , sn-glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase , and sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase . This enzyme participates in glycerolipid metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
