   Carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase (ferredoxin)      Carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase (ferredoxin)   In enzymology , a carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase (ferredoxin) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CO + H 2 O + oxidized ferredoxin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CO 2 + reduced ferredoxin   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are CO , H 2 O , and oxidized ferredoxin , whereas its two products are CO 2 and reduced ferredoxin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with an iron-sulfur protein as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is carbon-monoxide,water:ferredoxin oxidoreductase .  References       "  Category:EC 1.2.7  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
