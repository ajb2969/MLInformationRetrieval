   Clock hypothesis      Clock hypothesis   The clock hypothesis is an assumption in special relativity . It states that the rate of a clock doesn't depend on its acceleration but only on its instantaneous velocity. This is equivalent to stating, that a clock moving along a path   P   P   P   measures the proper time , defined by:       d  τ   =    ∫  P      d   t  2    -    d   x  2    /   c  2    -    d   y  2    /   c  2    -    d   z  2    /   c  2             d  τ     subscript   P         d   superscript  t  2        d   superscript  x  2     superscript  c  2        d   superscript  y  2     superscript  c  2        d   superscript  z  2     superscript  c  2         d\tau=\int_{P}\sqrt{dt^{2}-dx^{2}/c^{2}-dy^{2}/c^{2}-dz^{2}/c^{2}}   . The clock hypothesis was implicitly (but not explicitly) included in Einstein's original 1905 formulation of special relativity. Since then, it has become a standard assumption and is usually included in the axioms of special relativity, especially in the light of experimental verification up to very high accelerations in particle accelerators .
