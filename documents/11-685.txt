   Biuret amidohydrolase      Biuret amidohydrolase   In enzymology , a biuret amidohydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   biuret + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   urea + CO 2 + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are biuret and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are urea , CO 2 , and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is biuret amidohydrolase . This enzyme participates in atrazine degradation .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
