Epi-isozizaene 5-monooxygenase

Epi-isozizaene 5-monooxygenase (, CYP170A1) is an enzyme with system name (+)-epi-isozizaene,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (5-hydroxylating).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(+)-epi-isozizaene + 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + 2 O2

 
  albaflavenone + 2 NADP+ + 3 H2O (overall reaction)
 
(1a) (+)-epi-isozizaene + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  (5S)-albaflavenol + NADP+ + H2O
 
(1b) (5S)-albaflavenol + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  albaflavenone + NADP+ + 2 H2O
 
(2a) (+)-epi-isozizaene + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  (5R)-albaflavenol + NADP+ + H2O
 
(2b) (5R)-albaflavenol + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  albaflavenone + NADP+ + 2 H2O
 

This cytochrome P450 enzyme is purifid from bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor.
