Zero-crossing rate




Zero-crossing rate

The zero-crossing rate is the rate of sign-changes along a signal, i.e., the rate at which the signal changes from positive to negative or back.1 This feature has been used heavily in both speech recognition and music information retrieval, being a key feature to classify percussive sounds.2
ZCR is defined formally as



where 
 
 
 
  is a signal of length 
 
 
 
  and the indicator function 
 
 
 
  is 1 if its argument 
 
 
 
  is true and 0 otherwise.
In some cases only the "positive-going" or "negative-going" crossings are counted, rather than all the crossings - since, logically, between a pair of adjacent positive zero-crossings there must be one and only one negative zero-crossing.
For monophonic tonal signals, the zero-crossing rate can be used as a primitive pitch detection algorithm.
Applications
Zero crossing rates are used for Voice activity detection(VAD), i.e., finding whether a segment of speech is voiced or unvoiced.
