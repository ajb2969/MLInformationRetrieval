   Zero-crossing rate      Zero-crossing rate   The zero-crossing rate is the rate of sign-changes along a signal , i.e., the rate at which the signal changes from positive to negative or back. 1 This feature has been used heavily in both speech recognition and music information retrieval , being a key feature to classify percussive sounds. 2  ZCR is defined formally as      z  c  r  =   1   T  -  1     ∑   t  =  1    T  -  1    𝕀   {   s  t    s   t  -  1    <  0  }      fragments  z  c  r     1    T  1     superscript   subscript     t  1      T  1    I   fragments  normal-{   subscript  s  t    subscript  s    t  1     0  normal-}     zcr=\frac{1}{T-1}\sum_{t=1}^{T-1}{{\mathbb{I}}\left\{{s_{t}s_{t-1}<0}\right\}}     where   s   s   s   is a signal of length   T   T   T   and the indicator function    𝕀   {  A  }       𝕀   A     {{\mathbb{I}}\left\{{A}\right\}}   is 1 if its argument   A   A   A   is true and 0 otherwise.  In some cases only the "positive-going" or "negative-going" crossings are counted, rather than all the crossings - since, logically, between a pair of adjacent positive zero-crossings there must be one and only one negative zero-crossing.  For monophonic tonal signals, the zero-crossing rate can be used as a primitive pitch detection algorithm .  Applications  Zero crossing rates are used for Voice activity detection (VAD), i.e., finding whether a segment of speech is voiced or unvoiced.
