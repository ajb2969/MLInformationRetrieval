Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (acylating)

Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (acylating) (, succinyl-coA reductase, coenzyme-A-dependent succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase) is an enzyme with system name succinate semialdehyde:NADP+ oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

succinate semialdehyde + CoA + NADP+

 
  succinyl-CoA + NADPH + H+


Catalyses the NADPH-dependent reduction of succinyl-CoA to succinate semialdehyde.
