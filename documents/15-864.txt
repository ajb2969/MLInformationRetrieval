   Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (acylating)      Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (acylating)   Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (acylating) (, succinyl-coA reductase , coenzyme-A-dependent succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase ) is an enzyme with system name succinate semialdehyde:NADP + oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating) . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   succinate semialdehyde + CoA + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   succinyl-CoA + NADPH + H +    Catalyses the NADPH-dependent reduction of succinyl-CoA to succinate semialdehyde.
