Moffat distribution

The Moffat distribution, named after the physicist Anthony Moffat, is a continuous probability distribution based upon the Lorentzian distribution. Its particular importance in astrophysics is due to its ability to accurately reconstruct point spread functions, whose wings cannot be accurately portrayed by either a Gaussian or Lorentzian function.
Characterisation
Probability density function
The Moffat distribution can be described in two ways. Firstly as the distribution of a bivariate random variable (X,Y) centred at zero, and secondly as the distribution of the corresponding radii


 
  In terms of the random vector (X,Y), the distribution has the probability density function (pdf)



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are seeing dependent parameters. In this form, the distribution is a reparameterisation of a bivariate Student distribution with zero correlation.
In terms of the random variable R, the distribution has density



Differential equation
The pdf of the Moffat distribution is a solution to the following differential equation:
