   Indole-3-acetaldehyde reductase (NADH)      Indole-3-acetaldehyde reductase (NADH)   In enzymology , an indole-3-acetaldehyde reductase (NADH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (indol-3-yl)ethanol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (indol-3-yl)acetaldehyde + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (indol-3-yl)ethanol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are (indol-3-yl)acetaldehyde , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (indol-3-yl)ethanol:NAD + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include indoleacetaldehyde reductase , indole-3-acetaldehyde reductase (NADH) , and indole-3-ethanol:NAD + oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
