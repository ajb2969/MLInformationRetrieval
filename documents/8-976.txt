Immanant of a matrix


Immanant redirects here; it should not be confused with the philosophical immanent.


In mathematics, the immanant of a matrix was defined by Dudley E. Littlewood and Archibald Read Richardson as a generalisation of the concepts of determinant and permanent.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a partition of 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  be the corresponding irreducible representation-theoretic character of the symmetric group

 
 . The immanant of an 
 
 
matrix

 
  associated with the character 
 
 
 
  is defined as the expression



The determinant is a special case of the immanant, where 
 
 
 
  is the alternating character

 
 , of Sn, defined by the parity of a permutation.
The permanent is the case where 
 
 
 
  is the trivial character, which is identically equal to 1.
For example, for 
 
 
 
  matrices, there are three irreducible representations of 
 
 
 
 , as shown in the character table:

As stated above, 
 
 
 
  produces the permanent and 
 
 
 
  produces the determinant, but 
 
 
 
  produces the operation that maps as follows:



Littlewood and Richardson also studied its relation to Schur functions in the representation theory of the symmetric group.
