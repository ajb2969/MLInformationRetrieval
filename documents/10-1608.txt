Aconitate Delta-isomerase




Aconitate Delta-isomerase

In enzymology, an aconitate Delta-isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

trans-aconitate 
 
 
 
  cis-aconitate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, trans-aconitate, and one product, cis-aconitate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases transposing C=C bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aconitate Delta2-Delta3-isomerase. This enzyme is also called aconitate isomerase.
