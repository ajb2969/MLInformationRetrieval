Hermite number

In mathematics, Hermite numbers are values of Hermite polynomials at zero argument. Typically they are defined for physicists' Hermite polynomials.
Formal definition
The numbers Hn = Hn(0), where Hn(x) is a Hermite polynomial of order n, may be called Hermite numbers.1
The first Hermite numbers are:

































Recursion relations
Are obtained from recursion relations of Hermitian polynomials for x = 0:



Since H0 = 1 and H1 = 0 one can construct a closed formula for Hn:



where (n - 1)!! = 1 × 3 × ... × (n - 1).
Usage
From the generating function of Hermitian polynomials it follows that



Reference 2 gives a formal power series:



where formally the n-th power of H, Hn, is the n-th Hermite number, Hn. (See Umbral calculus.)
