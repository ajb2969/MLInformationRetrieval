   2-ethylmalate synthase      2-ethylmalate synthase   In enzymology , a 2-ethylmalate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + H 2 O + 2-oxobutanoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (R)-2-ethylmalate + CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA , H 2 O , and 2-oxobutanoate , whereas its two products are (R)-2-ethylmalate and CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases that convert acyl groups into alkyl groups on transfer. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:2-oxobutanoate C-acetyltransferase (thioester-hydrolysing, carboxymethyl-forming) . Other names in common use include (R)-2-ethylmalate 2-oxobutanoyl-lyase (CoA-acetylating) , 2-ethylmalate-3-hydroxybutanedioate synthase , propylmalate synthase , and propylmalic synthase . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.3.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
