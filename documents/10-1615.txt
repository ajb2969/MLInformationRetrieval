   Alpha-pinene-oxide decyclase      Alpha-pinene-oxide decyclase   In enzymology , an alpha-pinene-oxide decyclase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   alpha-pinene oxide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (Z)-2-methyl-5-isopropylhexa-2,5-dienal   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , alpha-pinene oxide , and one product , (Z)-2-methyl-5-isopropylhexa-2,5-dienal .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically the class of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha-pinene-oxide lyase (decyclizing) . This enzyme is also called alpha-pinene oxide lyase . This enzyme participates in limonene and pinene degradation.  References     "  Category:EC 5.5.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
