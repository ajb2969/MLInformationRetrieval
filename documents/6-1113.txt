Magnetic effective resistance

Magnetic effective resistance (SI Unit: -Ω−1) is the real component of complex magnetic impedance of a circuit in the gyrator-capacitor model. This causes a magnetic circuit to lose magnetic potential energy.123
Active power in a magnetic circuit equals the product of magnetic effective resistance 
 
 
 
  and magnetic current squared 
 
 
 
 .



The magnetic effective resistance on a complex plane appears as the side of the resistance triangle for magnetic circuit of an alternating current. The effective magnetic resistance is bounding with the effective magnetic conductance 
 
 
 
  by the expression



where 
 
 
 
  is the full magnetic impedance of a magnetic circuit.
