Momentum-transfer cross section

In physics, and especially scattering theory, the momentum-transfer cross section (sometimes known as the momentum-transport cross section1) is an effective scattering cross section useful for describing the average momentum transferred from a particle when it collides with a target. Essentially, it contains all the information about a scattering process necessary for calculating average momentum transfers but ignores other details about the scattering angle.
The momentum-transfer cross section 
 
 
 
  is defined in terms of an (azimuthally symmetric and momentum independent) differential cross section

 
  by







 
 .
 



The momentum-transfer cross section can be written in terms of the phase shifts from a partial wave analysis as 2



Explanation
The factor of 
 
 
 
  arises as follows. Let the incoming particle be traveling along the 
 
 
 
 -axis with vector momentum


 
 .
Suppose the particle scatters off the target with polar angle 
 
 
 
  and azimuthal angle 
 
 
 
  plane. Its new momentum is


 
 .
By conservation of momentum, the target has acquired momentum


 
 .
Now, if many particles scatter off the target, and the target is assumed have azimuthal symmetry, then the radial (
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ) components of the transferred momentum will average to zero. The average momentum transfer will be just 
 
 
 
 . If we do the full averaging over all possible scattering events, we get

where the total cross section is


 
 .
Therefore, for a given total cross section, one does not need to compute new integrals for every possible momentum in order to determine the average momentum transferred to a target. One just needs to compute
