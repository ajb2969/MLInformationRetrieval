   Quadratic mean diameter      Quadratic mean diameter   In Forestry , Quadratic mean diameter or QMD is a measure of Central tendency which is considered more appropriate than Arithmetic mean for characterizing the group of trees which have been measured. For n trees, QMD is calculated as:         ∑   D  i    2     n            superscript   subscript  D  i   2    n     \sqrt{\frac{\sum{D_{i}}^{2}}{n}}     where    D  i     subscript  D  i    {D_{i}}   is the Diameter at breast height of the i th tree. Compared to the arithmetic mean, QMD assigns greater weight to larger trees - QMD is always greater than or equal to arithmetic mean for a given set of trees. QMD can be used in timber cruises to estimate the standing volume of timber in a forest, because it has the practical advantage of being directly related to Basal area , which in turn is directly related to volume. 1 QMD can also be calculated as:        B  A    k  *  n            B  A     k  n      \sqrt{\frac{BA}{k*n}}     where BA is stand basal area, n is the number of trees, and k is a constant based on measurement units - for BA in ft 2 and DBH in inches, k=0.005454; for BA in m 2 and DBH in cm, k=0.0000785.
