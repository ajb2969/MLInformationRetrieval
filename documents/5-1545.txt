   Silverman–Toeplitz theorem      Silverman–Toeplitz theorem   In mathematics , the Silverman–Toeplitz theorem , first proved by Otto Toeplitz , is a result in summability theory characterizing matrix summability methods that are regular. A regular matrix summability method is a matrix transformation of a convergent sequence which preserves the limit .  An infinite matrix      (   a   i  ,  j    )     i  ,  j   ∈  ℕ      subscript   subscript  a   i  j       i  j   ℕ     (a_{i,j})_{i,j\in\mathbb{N}}   with complex -valued entries defines a regular summability method if and only if it satisfies all of the following properties:         lim   i  →  ∞     a   i  ,  j     =  0    j  ∈  ℕ      formulae-sequence      subscript    normal-→  i      subscript  a   i  j     0     j  ℕ     \lim_{i\to\infty}a_{i,j}=0\quad j\in\mathbb{N}   (every column sequence converges to 0)        lim   i  →  ∞      ∑   j  =  0   ∞    a   i  ,  j      =  1        subscript    normal-→  i       superscript   subscript     j  0       subscript  a   i  j      1    \lim_{i\to\infty}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}a_{i,j}=1   (the row sums converge to 1)        sup  i     ∑   j  =  0   ∞    |   a   i  ,  j    |     <  ∞        subscript  supremum  i     superscript   subscript     j  0         subscript  a   i  j          \sup_{i}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}|a_{i,j}|<\infty   (the absolute row sums are bounded).
