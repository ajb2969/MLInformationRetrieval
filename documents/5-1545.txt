Silverman–Toeplitz theorem

In mathematics, the Silverman–Toeplitz theorem, first proved by Otto Toeplitz, is a result in summability theory characterizing matrix summability methods that are regular. A regular matrix summability method is a matrix transformation of a convergent sequence which preserves the limit.
An infinite matrix

 
  with complex-valued entries defines a regular summability method if and only if it satisfies all of the following properties:


 
  (every column sequence converges to 0)


 
  (the row sums converge to 1)


 
  (the absolute row sums are bounded).
