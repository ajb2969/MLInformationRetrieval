   Pearl vortex      Pearl vortex   In superconductivity , a Pearl vortex is a vortex of supercurrent in a thin film of type-II superconductor , first described in 1964 by Judea Pearl . 1 A Pearl vortex is similar to Abrikosov vortex except for its magnetic field profile which, due to the dominant air-metal interface, diverges sharply as 1/   r   r   r   at short distances from the center, and decays slowly, like 1/    r  2     superscript  r  2    r^{2}   at long distances. Abrikosov's vortices, in comparison, have very short range interaction and diverge as    l  o  g   (   1  /  r   )       l  o  g    1  r     log(1/r)   near the center.  A transport current flowing through a superconducting film may cause these vortices to move with a constant velocity   v   v   v   proportional to, and perpendicular to the transport current. Because of their proximity to the surface, and their sharp field divergence at their centers, Pearl's vortices can actually be seen by a scanning SQUID microscope . 2 3 4 The characteristic length governing the distribution of the magnetic field around the vortex center is given by the ratio    Λ  =   2   λ  2        normal-Λ    2   superscript  λ  2      \Lambda=2\lambda^{2}   /   d   d   d   , also known as "Pearl length," where   d   d   d   is the film thickness and   λ   λ   \lambda   is London penetration depth . 5 Because this ratio can reach macroscopic dimensions (~1 mm) by making the film sufficiently thin, it can be measured relatively easy and used to estimate the density of superconducting electrons. 6  At distances shorter than the Pearl's length, vortices behave like a Coulomb gas (1/   r   r   r   repulsive force).
