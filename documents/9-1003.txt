Hexacode

In coding theory, the hexacode is a length 6 linear code of dimension 3 over the Galois field

 
  of 4 elements defined by


 
  It is a 3-dimensional subspace of the vector space of dimension 6 over 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  contains 45 codewords of weight 4, 18 codewords of weight 6 and the zero word. The full automorphism group of the hexacode is 
 
 
 
 . The hexacode can be used to describe the Miracle Octad Generator of R. T. Curtis.
