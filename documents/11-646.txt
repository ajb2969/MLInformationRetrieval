   1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate deaminase      1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate deaminase   In enzymology , a 1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate deaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2,5-dioxopentanoate + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 2,5-dioxopentanoate and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate aminohydrolase (decyclizing) . This enzyme is also called HPC deaminase . This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 3.5.4  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
