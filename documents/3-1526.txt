Whiteness

In colorimetry, whiteness is the degree to which a surface is white. An example of its use might be to quantitatively compare two pieces of paper which appear white viewed individually, but not when juxtaposed.
The International Commission on Illumination describes it in the following terms:
Calculation






where

Y is the Y tristimulus value (relative luminance),
(x,y) is the chromaticity coordinate in the CIE 1931 color space
(xn,yn) is the chromaticity coordinate of the perfect diffuser (reference white)

The numbers in the subscript indicate the observer: two for the CIE 1931 standard observer and ten for the CIE 1964 standard observer.
Notes

W increases with whiteness, reaching 100 for the perfect diffuser.
The tint is green for positive T and red for negative T.
Equal differences in W may not appear equally different.
