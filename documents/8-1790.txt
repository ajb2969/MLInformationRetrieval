   Involutory matrix      Involutory matrix   In mathematics , an involutory matrix is a matrix that is its own inverse. That is, multiplication by matrix A is an involution if and only if A 2 = I . Involutory matrices are all square roots of the identity matrix . This is simply a consequence of the fact that any nonsingular matrix multiplied by its inverse is the identity. 1  Examples  The 2 × 2 real matrix    (     a    b      c     -  a      )      a  b    c    a      \begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 c&-a\end{pmatrix}   is involutory provided that      a  2   +   b  c    =  1.         superscript  a  2     b  c    1.    a^{2}+bc=1.    2  One of the three classes of elementary matrix is involutory, namely the row-interchange elementary matrix . A special case of another class of elementary matrix, that which represents multiplication of a row or column by −1, is also involutory; it is in fact a trivial example of a signature matrix , all of which are involutory.  Some simple examples of involutory matrices are shown below.          𝐈  =   (     1    0    0      0    1    0      0    0    1     )    ;       𝐈   -  1    =   (     1    0    0      0    1    0      0    0    1     )              𝐑  =   (     1    0    0      0    0    1      0    1    0     )    ;       𝐑   -  1    =   (     1    0    0      0    0    1      0    1    0     )              𝐒  =   (      +  1     0    0      0     -  1     0      0    0     -  1      )    ;       𝐒   -  1    =   (      +  1     0    0      0     -  1     0      0    0     -  1      )            𝐈    1  0  0    0  1  0    0  0  1        superscript  𝐈    1      1  0  0    0  1  0    0  0  1        missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression       𝐑    1  0  0    0  0  1    0  1  0        superscript  𝐑    1      1  0  0    0  0  1    0  1  0        missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression       𝐒      1   0  0    0    1   0    0  0    1         superscript  𝐒    1        1   0  0    0    1   0    0  0    1         \begin{array}[]{cc}\mathbf{I}=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\

 \end{array}     where   I is the identity matrix (which is trivially involutory);  R is an identity matrix with a pair of interchanged rows;  S is a signature matrix .   Clearly, any block-diagonal matrices constructed from involutory matrices will also be involutory, as a consequence of the linear independence of the blocks.  Symmetry  An involutory matrix which is also symmetric is an orthogonal matrix , and thus represents an isometry (a linear transformation which preserves Euclidean distance ). Conversely every orthogonal involutory matrix is symmetric. 3 As a special case of this, every reflection matrix is a involutory.  Properties  The determinant of an involutory matrix over any field is ±1. 4  If A is an n × n matrix, then A is involutory if and only if ½( A + I ) is idempotent . This relation gives a bijection between involutory matrices and idempotent matrices. 5  If A is an involutory matrix in M( n ,ℝ), a matrix algebra over the real numbers , then the subalgebra { x  I + y  A : x,y ∈ ℝ} generated by  A is isomorphic to the split-complex numbers .  if A and B are two involutory matrices which commute with each other then AB is also involutory.  if A is involutory matrix then every natural power of A is involutory.
