   5-guanidino-2-oxopentanoate decarboxylase      5-guanidino-2-oxopentanoate decarboxylase   In enzymology , a 5-guanidino-2-oxopentanoate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5-guanidino-2-oxo-pentanoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-guanidinobutanal + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 5-guanidino-2-oxo-pentanoate , and two products , 4-guanidinobutanal and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-guanidino-2-oxo-pentanoate carboxy-lyase (4-guanidinobutanal-forming) . Other names in common use include alpha-ketoarginine decarboxylase , and 2-oxo-5-guanidinopentanoate carboxy-lyase . It has 2 cofactors : thiamin diphosphate , and Divalent cation .
