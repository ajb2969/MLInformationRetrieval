   Nilpotent operator      Nilpotent operator   In operator theory , a bounded operator T on a Hilbert space is said to be nilpotent if T n = 0 for some n . It is said to be quasinilpotent or topological nilpotent if its spectrum  σ ( T ) = {0}.  Examples  In the finite-dimensional case, i.e. when T is a square matrix with complex entries, σ ( T ) = {0} if and only if T is similar to a matrix whose only nonzero entries are on the superdiagonal, by the Jordan canonical form . In turn this is equivalent to T n = 0 for some n . Therefore, for matrices, quasinilpotency coincides with nilpotency.  This is not true when H is infinite-dimensional. Consider the Volterra operator , defined as follows: consider the unit square X = [0,1] × [0,1] ⊂ R 2 , with the Lebesgue measure m . On X , define the (kernel) function K by      K   (  x  ,  y  )   =   {      1  ,        if   x   ≥  y        0  ,      otherwise  .          fragments  K   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-,  y  normal-)     fragments  normal-{    1      if  x   y     0  otherwise       K(x,y)=\left\{\begin{matrix}1,&\mbox{if}\;x\geq y\\
 0,&\mbox{otherwise}.\end{matrix}\right.     The Volterra operator is the corresponding integral operator  T on the Hilbert space L 2 ( X , m ) given by        T  f   (  x  )    =    ∫  0  1    K   (  x  ,  y  )   f   (  y  )   d  y     .        T  f  x     superscript   subscript   0   1     K   x  y   f  y  d  y      Tf(x)=\int_{0}^{1}K(x,y)f(y)dy.     The operator T is not nilpotent: take f to be the function that is 1 everywhere and direct calculation shows that T n f ≠ 0 (in the sense of L 2 ) for all n . However, T is quasinilpotent. First notice that K is in L 2 ( X , m ), therefore T is compact . By the spectral properties of compact operators, any nonzero λ in σ ( T ) is an eigenvalue. But it can be shown that T has no nonzero eigenvalues, therefore T is quasinilpotent.  "  Category:Operator theory
