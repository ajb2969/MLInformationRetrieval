23S rRNA (uracil1939-C5)-methyltransferase

23S rRNA (uracil1939-C5)-methyltransferase (, RumA, RNA uridine methyltransferase A, YgcA) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (uracil1939-C5)-methyltransferase.123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + uracil1939 in 23S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methyluracil1939 in 23S rRNA
 

The enzyme specifically methylates uracil1939 at C5 in 23S rRNA.
