First variation

In applied mathematics and the calculus of variations, the first variation of a functional J(y) is defined as the linear functional 
 
 
 
  mapping the function h to



where y and h are functions, and ε is a scalar. This is recognizable as the Gâteaux derivative of the functional.
Example
