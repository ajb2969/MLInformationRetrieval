Locally acyclic morphism




Locally acyclic morphism

In algebraic geometry, a morphism 
 
 
 
  of schemes is said to be locally acyclic if, roughly, any sheaf on S and its restriction to X through f have the same Ã©tale cohomology, locally. For example, a smooth morphism is universally locally acyclic.
