   Locally acyclic morphism      Locally acyclic morphism   In algebraic geometry , a morphism    f  :   X  →  S      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  S     f:X\to S   of schemes is said to be locally acyclic if, roughly, any sheaf on S and its restriction to X through f have the same étale cohomology , locally. For example, a smooth morphism is universally locally acyclic.  References    .   "  Category:Morphisms of schemes
