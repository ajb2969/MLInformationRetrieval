   Siegel–Walfisz theorem      Siegel–Walfisz theorem   In analytic number theory , the Siegel–Walfisz theorem was obtained by Arnold Walfisz 1 as an application of a theorem by Carl Ludwig Siegel 2 to primes in arithmetic progressions .  Statement  Define        ψ   (  x  ;  q  ,  a  )    =    ∑       n  ≤  x        n  ≡   a     (   mod  q   )           Λ   (  n  )      ,        ψ   x  q  a      subscript    STACKED    n  x     n   annotated  a   pmod  q         normal-Λ  n      \psi(x;q,a)=\sum_{n\leq x\atop n\equiv a\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}q)}\Lambda(n),     where   Λ   normal-Λ   \Lambda   denotes the von Mangoldt function and φ to be Euler's totient function .  Then the theorem states that given any real number N there exists a positive constant C N depending only on N such that        ψ   (  x  ;  q  ,  a  )    =    x   φ   (  q  )     +   O   (   x   exp   (   -    C  N     (   log  x   )    1  2      )     )      ,        ψ   x  q  a        x    φ  q      O    x         subscript  C  N    superscript    x     1  2            \psi(x;q,a)=\frac{x}{\varphi(q)}+O\left(x\exp\left(-C_{N}(\log x)^{\frac{1}{2}%
 }\right)\right),     whenever ( a , q ) = 1 and       q  ≤    (   log  x   )   N    .      q   superscript    x   N     q\leq(\log x)^{N}.     Remarks  The constant C N is not effectively computable because Siegel's theorem is ineffective.  From the theorem we can deduce the following form of the prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions : If, for ( a , q )=1, by    π   (  x  ;  q  ,  a  )       π   x  q  a     \pi(x;q,a)   we denote the number of primes less than or equal to x which are congruent to a mod q , then        π   (  x  ;  q  ,  a  )    =     Li   (  x  )     φ   (  q  )     +   O   (   x   exp   (   -     C  N   2     (   log  x   )    1  2      )     )      ,        π   x  q  a          Li  x     φ  q      O    x           subscript  C  N   2    superscript    x     1  2            \pi(x;q,a)=\frac{{\rm Li}(x)}{\varphi(q)}+O\left(x\exp\left(-\frac{C_{N}}{2}(%
 \log x)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)\right),   where N , a , q , C N and φ are as in the theorem, and Li denotes the offset logarithmic integral .  References    "  Category:Theorems in analytic number theory  Category:Theorems about prime numbers     ↩  ↩
