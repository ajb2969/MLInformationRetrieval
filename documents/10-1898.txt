Phosphoamidase




Phosphoamidase

In enzymology, a phosphoamidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-phosphocreatine + H2O 
 
 
 
  creatine + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-phosphocreatine and H2O, whereas its two products are creatine and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphorus-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphamide hydrolase. This enzyme is also called creatine phosphatase.
