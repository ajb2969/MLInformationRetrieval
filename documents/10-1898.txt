   Phosphoamidase      Phosphoamidase   In enzymology , a phosphoamidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-phosphocreatine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   creatine + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-phosphocreatine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are creatine and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphorus-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphamide hydrolase . This enzyme is also called creatine phosphatase .  References       "  Category:EC 3.9.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
