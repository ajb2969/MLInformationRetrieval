   GRS 80      GRS 80   GRS 80 , or Geodetic Reference System 1980 , is a geodetic reference system consisting of a global reference ellipsoid and a gravity field model .  Geodesy  Geodesy , also called geodetics, is the scientific discipline that deals with the measurement and representation of the earth , its gravitational field and geodynamic phenomena ( polar motion , earth tides , and crustal motion) in three-dimensional, time-varying space.  The geoid is essentially the figure of the Earth abstracted from its topographic features. It is an idealized equilibrium surface of sea water, the mean sea level surface in the absence of currents, air pressure variations etc. and continued under the continental masses. The geoid, unlike the ellipsoid, is irregular and too complicated to serve as the computational surface on which to solve geometrical problems like point positioning. The geometrical separation between it and the reference ellipsoid is called the geoidal undulation . It varies globally between ±110 m.  A reference ellipsoid , customarily chosen to be the same size (volume) as the geoid, is described by its semi-major axis (equatorial radius) a and flattening f . The quantity f = ( a − b )/ a , where b is the semi-minor axis (polar radius), is a purely geometrical one. The mechanical ellipticity of the earth (dynamical flattening, symbol J 2 ) is determined to high precision by observation of satellite orbit perturbations. Its relationship with the geometric flattening is indirect. The relationship depends on the internal density distribution, or, in simplest terms, the degree of central concentration of mass.  The 1980 Geodetic Reference System (GRS 80) posited a 6 378 137m semi-major axis and a 1/298.257 222 101 flattening. This system was adopted at the XVII General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics ( IUGG ) in Canberra, Australia, 1979.  The GRS 80 reference system was originally used by the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84). The reference ellipsoid of WGS 84 now differs slightly due to its later refinements (see WGS84 ).  The numerous other systems which have been used by diverse countries for their maps and charts are gradually dropping out of use as more and more countries move to global, geocentric reference systems using the GRS80 reference ellipsoid.  Defining features of GRS 80  The reference ellipsoid is usually defined by its semi-major axis (equatorial radius)   a   a   a   and either its semi-minor axis (polar radius)   b   b   b   , aspect ratio     (   b  /  a   )      b  a    (b/a)   or flattening    f   f   f   , but GRS80 is an exception: For a complete definition, four independent constants are required. GRS80 chooses as these   a   a   a   ,    G  M      G  M    GM   ,    J  2     subscript  J  2    J_{2}   and   ω   ω   \omega   , making the geometrical constant   f   f   f   a derived quantity.
