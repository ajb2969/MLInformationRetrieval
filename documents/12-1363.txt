   Resolution (algebra)      Resolution (algebra)   In mathematics , particularly in abstract algebra and homological algebra , a resolution (or left resolution ; dually a coresolution or right resolution 1 ) is an exact sequence of modules (or, more generally, of objects in an abelian category ), which is used to describe the structure of a specific module or object of this category. In particular, projective and injective resolutions induce a quasi-isomorphism between the exact sequence and the module, which may be regarded as a weak equivalence , with the resolution having nicer properties as a space . 2  Generally, the objects in the sequence are restricted to have some property P (for example to be free). Thus one speaks of a P resolution : for example, a flat resolution , a free resolution , an injective resolution , a projective resolution . The sequence is supposed to be infinite to the left (to the right for a coresolution). However, a finite resolution is one where only finitely many of the objects in the sequence are non-zero .  Resolutions of modules  Definitions  Given a module M over a ring R , a left resolution (or simply resolution ) of M is an exact sequence (possibly infinite) of R -modules       ⋯   ⟶   d   n  +  1      E  n    ⟶   d  n    ⋯   ⟶   d  3     E  2    ⟶   d  2     E  1    ⟶   d  1     E  0    ⟶  ϵ   M   ⟶  0.     normal-⟶    normal-⋯    subscript  d    n  1    normal-⟶    subscript  E  n     subscript  d  n   normal-⟶   normal-⋯    subscript  d  3   normal-⟶    subscript  E  2     subscript  d  2   normal-⟶    subscript  E  1     subscript  d  1   normal-⟶    subscript  E  0    ϵ  normal-⟶   M   0.    \cdots\overset{d_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow}E_{n}\overset{d_{n}}{\longrightarrow}%

 \longrightarrow 0.   The homomorphisms d i are called boundary maps. The map ε is called an augmentation map . For succinctness, the resolution above can be written as        E  ∙    ⟶  ϵ   M   ⟶  0.     normal-⟶     subscript  E  normal-∙    ϵ  normal-⟶   M   0.    E_{\bullet}\overset{\epsilon}{\longrightarrow}M\longrightarrow 0.     The dual notion is that of a right resolution (or coresolution , or simply resolution ). Specifically, given a module M over a ring R , a right resolution is a possibly infinite exact sequence of R -modules       0  ⟶   M   ⟶  ϵ    C  0    ⟶   d  0     C  1    ⟶   d  1     C  2    ⟶   d  2    ⋯   ⟶   d   n  -  1      C  n    ⟶   d  n    ⋯    ,     normal-⟶  0    M   ϵ  normal-⟶    superscript  C  0     superscript  d  0   normal-⟶    superscript  C  1     superscript  d  1   normal-⟶    superscript  C  2     superscript  d  2   normal-⟶   normal-⋯    superscript  d    n  1    normal-⟶    superscript  C  n     superscript  d  n   normal-⟶   normal-⋯     0\longrightarrow M\overset{\epsilon}{\longrightarrow}C^{0}\overset{d^{0}}{%

 \longrightarrow}\cdots,   where each C i is an R -module (it is common to use superscripts on the objects in the resolution and the maps between them to indicate the dual nature of such a resolution). For succinctness, the resolution above can be written as       0  ⟶   M   ⟶  ϵ    C  ∙     .     normal-⟶  0    M   ϵ  normal-⟶    superscript  C  normal-∙      0\longrightarrow M\overset{\epsilon}{\longrightarrow}C^{\bullet}.    A (co)resolution is said to be finite if only finitely many of the modules involved are non-zero. The length of a finite resolution is the maximum index n labeling a nonzero module in the finite resolution.  Free, projective, injective, and flat resolutions  In many circumstances conditions are imposed on the modules E i resolving the given module M . For example, a free resolution of a module M is a left resolution in which all the modules E i are free R -modules. Likewise, projective and flat resolutions are left resolutions such that all the E i are projective and flat  R -modules, respectively. Injective resolutions are right resolutions whose C i are all injective modules .  Every R -module possesses a free left resolution. 3  A fortiori , every module also admits projective and flat resolutions. The proof idea is to define E 0 to be the free R -module generated by the elements of M , and then E 1 to be the free R -module generated by the elements of the kernel of the natural map E 0 → M etc. Dually, every R -module possesses an injective resolution. Flat resolutions can be used to compute Tor functors .  Projective resolution of a module M is unique up to a chain homotopy , i.e., given two projective resolution P 0 → M and P 1 → M of M there exists a chain homotopy between them.  Resolutions are used to define homological dimensions . The minimal length of a finite projective resolution of a module M is called its projective dimension and denoted pd( M ). For example, a module has projective dimension zero if and only if it is a projective module. If M does not admit a finite projective resolution then the projective dimension is infinite. For example, for a commutative local ring  R , the projective dimension is finite if and only if R is regular and in this case it coincides with the Krull dimension of R . Analogously, the injective dimension id( M ) and flat dimension fd( M ) are defined for modules also.  The injective and projective dimensions are used on the category of right R modules to define a homological dimension for R called the right global dimension of R . Similarly, flat dimension is used to define weak global dimension . The behavior of these dimensions reflects characteristics of the ring. For example, a ring has right global dimension 0 if and only if it is a semisimple ring , and a ring has weak global dimension 0 if and only if it is a von Neumann regular ring .  Graded modules and algebras  Let M be a graded module over a graded algebra , which is generated over a field by its elements of positive degree. Then M has a free resolution in which the free modules E i may be graded in such a way that the d i and ε are graded linear maps . Among these graded free resolutions, the minimal free resolutions are those for which the number of basis elements of each E i is minimal. The number of basis elements of each E i and their degrees are the same for all the minimal free resolutions of a graded module.  If I is a homogeneous ideal in a polynomial ring over a field, the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the projective algebraic set defined by I is the minimal integer r such that the degrees of the basis elements of the E i in a minimal free resolution of I are all lower than r-i .  Examples  A classic example of a free resolution is given by the Koszul complex of a regular sequence in a local ring or of a homogeneous regular sequence in a graded algebra finitely generated over a field.  Let X be an aspherical space , i.e., its universal cover  E is contractible . Then every singular (or simplicial ) chain complex of E is a free resolution of the module Z not only over the ring Z but also over the group ring  Z [ π 1 ( X )].  Resolutions in abelian categories  The definition of resolutions of an object M in an abelian category  A is the same as above, but the E i and C i are objects in A , and all maps involved are morphisms in A .  The analogous notion of projective and injective modules are projective and injective objects , and, accordingly, projective and injective resolutions. However, such resolutions need not exist in a general abelian category A . If every object of A has a projective (resp. injective) resolution, then A is said to have enough projectives (resp. enough injectives ). Even if they do exist, such resolutions are often difficult to work with. For example, as pointed out above, every R -module has an injective resolution, but this resolution is not functorial , i.e., given a homomorphism M → ''M' '', together with injective resolutions        0  →  M  →   I  *    ,   0  →   M  ′   →   I  *  ′     ,     formulae-sequence     normal-→  0  M    normal-→     subscript  I         normal-→  0   superscript  M  normal-′     normal-→     subscript   superscript  I  normal-′         0\rightarrow M\rightarrow I_{*},\ \ 0\rightarrow M^{\prime}\rightarrow I^{%
 \prime}_{*},   there is in general no functorial way of obtaining a map between    I  *     subscript  I     I_{*}   and    I  *  ′     subscript   superscript  I  normal-′      I^{\prime}_{*}   .  Acyclic resolution  In many cases one is not really interested in the objects appearing in a resolution, but in the behavior of the resolution with respect to a given functor . Therefore, in many situations, the notion of acyclic resolutions is used: given a left exact functor  F : A → B between two abelian categories, a resolution      0  →  M  →   E  0   →   E  1   →   E  2   →  …       normal-→  0  M    normal-→     subscript  E  0     normal-→     subscript  E  1     normal-→     subscript  E  2     normal-→    normal-…     0\rightarrow M\rightarrow E_{0}\rightarrow E_{1}\rightarrow E_{2}\rightarrow\dots   of an object M of A is called F -acyclic, if the derived functors  R i F ( E n ) vanish for all i >0 and n ≥0. Dually, a left resolution is acyclic with respect to a right exact functor if its derived functors vanish on the objects of the resolution.  For example, given a R module M , the tensor product       ⊗  R   M      subscript  tensor-product  R   absent  M    \otimes_{R}M   is a right exact functor Mod ( R ) → Mod ( R ). Every flat resolution is acyclic with respect to this functor. A flat resolution is acyclic for the tensor product by every M . Similarly, resolutions that are acyclic for all the functors Hom ( ⋅ , M ) are the projective resolutions and those that are acyclic for the functors Hom ( M ,  ⋅ ) are the injective resolutions.  Any injective (projective) resolution is F -acyclic for any left exact (right exact, respectively) functor.  The importance of acyclic resolutions lies in the fact that the derived functors R i F (of a left exact functor, and likewise L i F of a right exact functor) can be obtained from as the homology of F -acyclic resolutions: given an acyclic resolution    E  *     subscript  E     E_{*}   of an object M , we have         R  i   F   (  M  )    =    H  i   F   (   E  *   )     ,         subscript  R  i   F  M      subscript  H  i   F   subscript  E       R_{i}F(M)=H_{i}F(E_{*}),   where right hand side is the i -th homology object of the complex     F   (   E  *   )    .      F   subscript  E      F(E_{*}).     This situation applies in many situations. For example, for the constant sheaf  R on a differentiable manifold  M can be resolved by the sheaves     𝒞  *    (  M  )        superscript  𝒞    M    \mathcal{C}^{*}(M)   of smooth differential forms :    0  →  R  ⊂    𝒞  0    (  M  )     →  d     𝒞  1    (  M  )     →  d    …   𝒞   d  i  m  M     (  M  )    →  0.       normal-→  0  R          superscript  𝒞  0   M      superscript  normal-→  d        superscript  𝒞  1   M      superscript  normal-→  d       normal-…   superscript  𝒞    d  i  m  M    M     normal-→    0.     0\rightarrow R\subset\mathcal{C}^{0}(M)\stackrel{d}{\rightarrow}\mathcal{C}^{1%
 }(M)\stackrel{d}{\rightarrow}\dots\mathcal{C}^{dimM}(M)\rightarrow 0.   The sheaves     𝒞  *    (  M  )        superscript  𝒞    M    \mathcal{C}^{*}(M)   are fine sheaves , which are known to be acyclic with respect to the global section functor    Γ  :   ℱ  ↦   ℱ   (  M  )        normal-:  normal-Γ   maps-to  ℱ    ℱ  M      \Gamma:\mathcal{F}\mapsto\mathcal{F}(M)   . Therefore, the sheaf cohomology , which is the derived functor of the global section functor Γ is computed as       H  i    (  M  ,  𝐑  )    =    H  i    (    𝒞  *    (  M  )    )     .         superscript  normal-H  i    M  𝐑       superscript  normal-H  i      superscript  𝒞    M      \mathrm{H}^{i}(M,\mathbf{R})=\mathrm{H}^{i}(\mathcal{C}^{*}(M)).     Similarly Godement resolutions are acyclic with respect to the global sections functor.
