Resistance distance

In graph theory, the resistance distance between two vertices of a simple connected graph, G, is equal to the resistance between two equivalent points on an electrical network, constructed so as to correspond to G, with each edge being replaced by a 1 ohm resistance. It is a metric on graphs.
Definition
On a graph G, the resistance distance Ωi,j between two vertices vi and vj is



where Γ is the Moore–Penrose inverse of the Laplacian matrix of G. 
Properties of resistance distance
If i = j then



For an undirected graph



General sum rule
For any N-vertex simple connected graph G = (V, E) and arbitrary N×N matrix M:



From this generalized sum rule a number of relationships can be derived depending on the choice of M. Two of note are;





 
  are the non-zero eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix. This unordered sum  is called the Kirchhoff index of the graph.
Relationship to the number of spanning trees of a graph
For a simple connected graph G = (V, E), the resistance distance between two vertices may by expressed as a function of the set of spanning trees, T, of G as follows:



where 
 
 
 
  is the set of spanning trees for the graph

As a squared Euclidean distance
Since the Laplacian 
 
 
 
  is symmetric and positive semi-definite, its pseudoinverse 
 
 
 
  is also symmetric and positive semi-definite. Thus, there is a 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and we can write:



showing that the square root of the resistance distance corresponds to the Euclidean distance in the space spanned by

Connection with Fibonacci numbers
A fan graph is a graph on 
 
 
 
  vertices where there is an edge between vertex 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and there is an edge between vertex 
 
 
 
  and

The resistance distance between vertex 
 
 
 
  and vertex 
 
 
 
  is
