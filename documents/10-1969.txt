Fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase

In enzymology, a fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-fructose 6-phosphate + phosphate 
 
 
 
  acetyl phosphate + D-erythrose 4-phosphate + H2O
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-fructose 6-phosphate and phosphate, whereas its 3 products are acetyl phosphate, D-erythrose 4-phosphate, and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-fructose-6-phosphate D-erythrose-4-phosphate-lyase (adding phosphate; acetyl-phosphate-forming). Other names in common use include D-fructose-6-phosphate D-erythrose-4-phosphate-lyase, and (phosphate-acetylating). This enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway.
