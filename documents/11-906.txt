   Galactosylacylglycerol O-acyltransferase      Galactosylacylglycerol O-acyltransferase   In enzymology , a galactosylacylglycerol O-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + sn-3-D-galactosyl-sn-2-acylglycerol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   [acyl-carrier-protein] + D-galactosyldiacylglycerol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein ] and sn-3-D-galactosyl-sn-2-acylglycerol , whereas its two products are acyl-carrier-protein and D-galactosyldiacylglycerol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]:D-galactosylacylglycerol O-acyltransferase . Other names in common use include acyl-acyl-carrier protein: lysomonogalactosyldiacylglycerol , acyltransferase , and acyl-ACP:lyso-MGDG acyltransferase . This enzyme participates in glycerolipid metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
