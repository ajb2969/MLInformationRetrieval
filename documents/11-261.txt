   ADP-sugar diphosphatase      ADP-sugar diphosphatase   In enzymology , an ADP-sugar diphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ADP-sugar + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + alpha-D-aldose 1-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ADP-sugar and H 2 O , whereas its two products are AMP and alpha-D-aldose 1-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ADP-sugar sugarphosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include ADP-sugar pyrophosphatase , and adenosine diphosphosugar pyrophosphatase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : fructose and mannose metabolism , purine metabolism , and starch and sucrose metabolism .
