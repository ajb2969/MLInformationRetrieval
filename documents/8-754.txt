   Cuspidal representation      Cuspidal representation   In number theory , cuspidal representations are certain representations of algebraic groups that occur discretely in    L  2     superscript  L  2    L^{2}   spaces. The term cuspidal is derived, at a certain distance, from the cusp forms of classical modular form theory. In the contemporary formulation of automorphic representations , representations take the place of holomorphic functions; these representations may be of adelic algebraic groups .  When the group is the general linear group     GL  2     subscript  GL  2    \operatorname{GL}_{2}   , the cuspidal representations are directly related to cusp forms and Maass forms . For the case of cusp forms, each Hecke eigenform ( newform ) corresponds to a cuspidal representation.  Formulation  Let G be a reductive algebraic group over a number field  K and let A denote the adeles of K . Let Z denote the centre of G and let ω be a continuous  unitary character from Z ( K )\Z( A ) × to C × . Fix a Haar measure on G ( A ) and let L 2 0 ( G ( K )\ G ( A ), ω) denote the Hilbert space of measurable complex-valued functions, f , on G ( A ) satisfying   f (γ g ) = f ( g ) for all γ ∈ G ( K )  f ( gz ) = f ( g )ω( z ) for all z ∈ Z ( A )        ∫     Z   (  𝐀  )   G   (  K  )    \  G    (  𝐀  )         |   f   (  g  )    |   2    d  g    <  ∞        subscript      normal-\    Z  𝐀  G  K   G   𝐀       superscript      f  g    2   d  g       \int_{Z(\mathbf{A})G(K)\backslash G(\mathbf{A})}|f(g)|^{2}\,dg<\infty           ∫     U   (  K  )    \  U    (  𝐀  )      f   (   u  g   )   d  u    =  0        subscript      normal-\    U  K   U   𝐀      f    u  g   d  u    0    \int_{U(K)\backslash U(\mathbf{A})}f(ug)\,du=0   for all unipotent radicals , U , of all proper parabolic subgroups of G ( A ).   This is called the space of cusp forms with central character ω on G ( A ). A function occurring in such a space is called a cuspidal function . This space is a unitary representation of the group G ( A ) where the action of g ∈ G ( A ) on a cuspidal function f is given by         (   g  ⋅  f   )    (  x  )    =   f   (   x  g   )     .         normal-⋅  g  f   x     f    x  g      (g\cdot f)(x)=f(xg).     The space of cusp forms with central character ω decomposes into a direct sum of Hilbert spaces        L  0  2    (     G   (  K  )    \  G    (  𝐀  )    ,  ω  )    =     ⊕  ^    (  π  ,   V  π   )     m  π    V  π           subscript   superscript  L  2   0       normal-\    G  K   G   𝐀   ω       subscript   normal-^  direct-sum    π   subscript  V  π      subscript  m  π    subscript  V  π      L^{2}_{0}(G(K)\backslash G(\mathbf{A}),\omega)=\hat{\bigoplus}_{(\pi,V_{\pi})}%
 m_{\pi}V_{\pi}   where the sum is over irreducible  subrepresentations of L 2 0 ( G ( K )\ G ( A ), ω) and m π are positive integers (i.e. each irreducible subrepresentation occurs with finite multiplicity). A cuspidal representation of G (A) is such a subrepresentation (π, V ) for some ω.  The groups for which the multiplicities m π all equal one are said to have the multiplicity-one property .
