   Debye–Waller factor      Debye–Waller factor   The Debye–Waller factor (DWF), named after Peter Debye and Ivar Waller , is used in condensed matter physics to describe the attenuation of x-ray scattering or coherent neutron scattering caused by thermal motion. 1 2 It has also been called the B factor or the temperature factor . Often, "Debye-Waller factor" is used as a generic term that comprises the Lamb-Mössbauer factor of incoherent neutron scattering and Mössbauer spectroscopy .  The DWF depends on the scattering vector  q . For a given q , DWF( q ) gives the fraction of elastic scattering; 1 - DWF( q ) correspondingly gives the fraction of inelastic scattering. (Strictly speaking, this probability interpretation is not true in general. 3 ) In diffraction studies, only the elastic scattering is useful; in crystals, it gives rise to distinct Bragg peaks . Inelastic scattering events are undesirable as they cause a diffuse background — unless the energies of scattered particles are analysed, in which case they carry valuable information ( for instance in inelastic neutron scattering or electron energy loss spectroscopy ).  The basic expression for the DWF is given by      DWF  =    ⟨   exp   (    i  𝐪   ⋅  𝐮   )    ⟩   2       DWF   superscript   delimited-⟨⟩     normal-⋅    i  𝐪   𝐮     2     \text{DWF}=\left\langle\exp\left(i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{u}\right)\right%
 \rangle^{2}     where u is the displacement of a scattering center, and <...> denotes either thermal or time averaging. ...  Assuming harmonicity of the scattering centers in the material under study, the Boltzmann distribution implies that    𝐪  ⋅  𝐮     normal-⋅  𝐪  𝐮    \mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{u}   is normally distributed with zero mean. Then, using for example the expression of the corresponding characteristic function , the DWF takes the form      DWF  =   exp   (   -   ⟨    [   𝐪  ⋅  𝐮   ]   2   ⟩    )        DWF       delimited-⟨⟩   superscript   delimited-[]   normal-⋅  𝐪  𝐮    2        \text{DWF}=\exp\left(-\langle[\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{u}]^{2}\rangle\right)     Note that although the above reasoning is classical, the same holds in quantum mechanics.  Assuming also isotropy of the harmonic potential, one may write      DWF  =   exp   (   -     q  2    ⟨   u  2   ⟩    /  3    )        DWF           superscript  q  2    delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  u  2     3       \text{DWF}=\exp\left(-q^{2}\langle u^{2}\rangle/3\right)     where q , u are the magnitudes (or absolute values) of the vectors q , u respectively, and    ⟨   u  2   ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  u  2     \langle u^{2}\rangle   is the mean squared displacement . In crystallographic publications, values of   U   U   U   are often given where    U  =   ⟨   u  2   ⟩       U   delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  u  2      U=\langle u^{2}\rangle   . Note that if the incident wave has wavelength   λ   λ   \lambda   , and it is elastically scattered by an angle of    2  θ      2  θ    2\theta   , then      q  =    4  π   sin   (  θ  )     λ       q      4  π    θ    λ     q=\frac{4\pi\sin(\theta)}{\lambda}     In the context of protein structures , the term B-factor is used. The B-factor is defined as:      B  =   8   π  2    ⟨   u  2   ⟩        B    8   superscript  π  2    delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  u  2       B=8\pi^{2}\langle u^{2}\rangle     It is measured in units of Å 2 . The B-factors can be taken as indicating the relative vibrational motion of different parts of the structure. Atoms with low B-factors belong to a part of the structure that is well-ordered. Atoms with large B-factors generally belong to part of the structure that is very flexible. Each ATOM record ( PDB file format ) of a crystal structure deposited with the Protein Data Bank contains a B-factor for that atom.
