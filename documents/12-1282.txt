It can be represented by the Schläfli symbol {3,3,3 2,2 }. It is constructed from 2 21  facets and has a 1 22  vertex figure , with 54 2 21 polytopes around every vertex.  Its vertex arrangement is the E 6 lattice , and the root system of the E 6  Lie group so it can also be called the E 6 honeycomb .  Construction  It is created by a Wythoff construction upon a set of 7 hyperplane mirrors in 6-dimensional space.  The facet information can be extracted from its Coxeter–Dynkin diagram , .  Removing a node on the end of one of the 2-node branches leaves the 2 21 , its only facet type,  The vertex figure is determined by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes 1 22 , .  The edge figure is the vertex figure of the vertex figure, here being a birectified 5-simplex , t 2 {3 4 }, .  The face figure is the vertex figure of the edge figure, here being a triangular duoprism , {3}×{3}, .  Kissing number  Each vertex of this tessellation is the center of a 5-sphere in the densest known packing in 6 dimensions, with kissing number 72, represented by the vertices of its vertex figure  1 22 .  E6 lattice  The 2 22 honeycomb's vertex arrangement is called the E 6 lattice . 1  The E 6 2 lattice , with 3,3,3 2,2  symmetry , can be constructed by the union of two E 6 lattices:    ∪    The E 6 * lattice 2 (or E 6 3 ) with [3[3 2,2,2 ]] symmetry. The Voronoi cell of the E 6 * lattice is the rectified 1 22 polytope, and the Voronoi tessellation is a bitruncated 2 22 honeycomb . 3 It is constructed by 3 copies of the E 6 lattice vertices, one from each of the three branches of the Coxeter diagram.    ∪  ∪  = dual to .    Related honeycombs  The 2 22 honeycomb is one of 127 uniform honeycombs (39 unique) with     E  ~   6     subscript   normal-~  E   6    {\tilde{E}}_{6}   symmetry. 24 of them have doubled symmetry 3,3,3 2,2 with 2 equally ringed branches and, and 7 have sextupled (3 ! ) symmetry [3[3 2,2,2 ]] with identical rings on all 3 branches. There are no regular honeycombs in the family since its Coxeter diagram a nonlinear graph, but the 2 22 and birectified 2 22 are isotopic , with only one type of facet : 2 21 , and rectified 1 22 polytopes respectively.

Birectified 2 22 honeycomb  The Birectified 2 22 honeycomb , has within its symmetry construction 3 copies of  facets. Its facets are centered on the vertex arrangement of E 6 * lattice , as:    +  +    Geometric folding  The     E  ~   6     subscript   normal-~  E   6    {\tilde{E}}_{6}   group is related to the     F  ~   4     subscript   normal-~  F   4    {\tilde{F}}_{4}   by a geometric folding , so this honeycomb can be projected into the 4-dimensional 16-cell honeycomb .

The final is a paracompact hyperbolic honeycomb, 3 22 . Each progressive uniform polytope is constructed from the previous as its vertex figure .  The 2 22 honeycomb is third in another dimensional series 2 2k .
