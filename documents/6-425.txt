Newton second

The newton second (symbol N s or N·s)1 is the derived SI unit of impulse and momentum. It can also be expressed as the kilogram metre per second (kg·m/s). One newton second corresponds to a one newton force applied for one second.

 
  It can be used to identify the resultant velocity of a mass if a force accelerates the mass for a specific time interval.
