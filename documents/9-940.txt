Hapke parameters

The Hapke parameters are a set of parameters for a quasi-experimental model that are commonly used to describe the directional reflectance properties of the airless regolith surfaces of bodies in the solar system. They were developed by astronomer Bruce Hapke at the University of Pittsburgh.
The quantities are:1



 
  — Single scattering albedo. This is the ratio of scattering efficiency to total light extinction (which includes also absorption), for small-particle scattering of light. That is, 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the scattering coefficient, and 
 
 
 
  is the absorption coefficient 2


 
  — The width of the opposition surge.


 
  or 
 
 
 
  — The strength of the opposition surge.


 
  or g — The particle phase function parameter, also called the asymmetry factor.


 
  — The effective surface tilt, also called the macroscopic roughness angle.

The Hapke parameters can be used to derive other albedo and scattering properties such as the geometric albedo, the phase integral, and the Bond albedo.
