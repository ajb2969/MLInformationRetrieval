   Hapke parameters      Hapke parameters   The Hapke parameters are a set of parameters for a quasi-experimental model that are commonly used to describe the directional reflectance properties of the airless regolith surfaces of bodies in the solar system . They were developed by astronomer Bruce Hapke at the University of Pittsburgh .  The quantities are: 1        ω  ¯   0     subscript   normal-¯  ω   0    \bar{\omega}_{0}   — Single scattering albedo . This is the ratio of scattering efficiency to total light extinction (which includes also absorption), for small-particle scattering of light. That is,     K  s   /   (    K  s   +   K  a    )        subscript  K  s      subscript  K  s    subscript  K  a      K_{s}/(K_{s}+K_{a})   , where    K  s     subscript  K  s    K_{s}   is the scattering coefficient , and    K  a     subscript  K  a    K_{a}   is the absorption coefficient  2     h   h   h   — The width of the opposition surge .      B  0     subscript  B  0    B_{0}   or    S  0     subscript  S  0    S_{0}   — The strength of the opposition surge.      P  0     subscript  P  0    P_{0}   or g — The particle phase function parameter, also called the asymmetry factor.     θ   θ   \theta   — The effective surface tilt, also called the macroscopic roughness angle.   The Hapke parameters can be used to derive other albedo and scattering properties such as the geometric albedo , the phase integral , and the Bond albedo .
