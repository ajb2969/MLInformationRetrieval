   Glutamate—putrescine ligase      Glutamate—putrescine ligase   In enzymology , a glutamate-putrescine ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-glutamate + putrescine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + gamma-L-glutamylputrescine   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , L-glutamate , and putrescine , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and gamma-L-glutamylputrescine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds as acid-D-ammonia (or amine) ligases (amide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutamate:putrescine ligase (ADP-forming) . Other names in common use include gamma-glutamylputrescine synthetase , and YcjK . This enzyme participates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups .  References     "  Category:EC 6.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
