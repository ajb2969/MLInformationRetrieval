   Relativistic particle      Relativistic particle   A relativistic particle is a particle which moves with a relativistic speed ; that is, a speed comparable to the speed of light . This is achieved by photons and by tachyons to the extent that effects described by special relativity are able to describe those of such particles themselves. Several approaches exist as a means of describing the motion of single and multiple relativistic particles, with a prominent example being postulations through Dirac equations of single particle motion.  Massive particles are relativistic when their kinetic energy is comparable to or greater than the energy    m   c  2       m   superscript  c  2     mc^{2}   corresponding to their rest mass . (This condition implies that their speed is close to the speed of light .) Such relativistic particles are generated in particle accelerators , and are naturally occurring in cosmic radiation . In astrophysics , jets of relativistic plasma are produced by the centers of active galaxies and quasars .  A charged relativistic particle crossing the interface of two media with different dielectric constants emits transition radiation . This is exploited in the transition radiation detectors of high-velocity particles.
