Log amplifier

A log amplifier is an amplifier for which the output voltage Vout is K times the natural log of the input voltage Vin. This can be expressed as,



where Vref is the normalization constant in volts and K is the scale factor.

The relationship between the input voltage 
 
 
 
  and the output voltage 
 
 
 
  is given by:



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the saturation current and the thermal voltage of the diode respectively.


Transdiode configuration
 A necessary condition for successful operation of a log amplifier is that the input voltage, Vin, is always positive. This may be ensured by using a rectifier and filter to condition the input signal before applying it to the log amp input. As Vin is positive, Vout is obliged to be negative (since the op amp is in the inverting configuration) and is large enough to forward bias the emitter-base junction of the BJT keeping it in the active mode of operation. Now,









where 
 
 
 
  is the saturation current of the emitter-base diode and 
 
 
 
  is the thermal voltage. Due to the virtual ground at the op amp differential input,


 
 , and



The output voltage is expressed as the natural log of the input voltage. Both the saturation current 
 
 
 
 
  and the thermal voltage 
 
 
 
  are temperature dependent, hence, temperature compensating circuits may be required.
