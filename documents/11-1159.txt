Pugh's closing lemma

In mathematics, Pugh's closing lemma is a result that links  periodic orbit solutions of  differential equations to  chaotic behaviour. It can be formally stated as follows:

Let 
 
 
 
  be a 
 
 
diffeomorphism of a  compact  smooth manifold

 
 . Given a  nonwandering point

 
  of 
 
 
 
 , there exists a diffeomorphism 
 
 
 
  arbitrarily close to 
 
 
 
  in the 
 
 
topology of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is a periodic point of 
 
 
 
 .1


Interpretation
Pugh's closing lemma means, for example, that any chaotic set in a bounded continuous dynamical system corresponds to a periodic orbit in a different but closely related dynamical system. As such, an open set of conditions on a bounded continuous dynamical system that rules out periodic behaviour also implies that the system cannot behave chaotically; this is the basis of some autonomous convergence theorems.
