   Pugh's closing lemma      Pugh's closing lemma   In mathematics , Pugh's closing lemma is a result that links periodic orbit solutions of differential equations to chaotic behaviour . It can be formally stated as follows:   Let    f  :   M  →  M      normal-:  f   normal-→  M  M     f:M\to M   be a    C  1     superscript  C  1    C^{1}    diffeomorphism of a compact  smooth manifold    M   M   M   . Given a nonwandering point    x   x   x   of   f   f   f   , there exists a diffeomorphism   g   g   g   arbitrarily close to   f   f   f   in the    C  1     superscript  C  1    C^{1}    topology of     Diff  1    (  M  )       superscript  Diff  1   M    \operatorname{Diff}^{1}(M)   such that   x   x   x   is a periodic point of   g   g   g   . 1    Interpretation  Pugh's closing lemma means, for example, that any chaotic set in a bounded continuous dynamical system corresponds to a periodic orbit in a different but closely related dynamical system. As such, an open set of conditions on a bounded continuous dynamical system that rules out periodic behaviour also implies that the system cannot behave chaotically; this is the basis of some autonomous convergence theorems .
