Sugar-terminal-phosphatase

In enzymology, a sugar-terminal-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-glucose 6-phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-glucose + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-glucose 6-phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are D-glucose and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sugar-omega-phosphate phosphohydrolase. This enzyme is also called xylitol-5-phosphatase.
