   Sugar-terminal-phosphatase      Sugar-terminal-phosphatase   In enzymology , a sugar-terminal-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-glucose 6-phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucose + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-glucose 6-phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are D-glucose and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sugar-omega-phosphate phosphohydrolase . This enzyme is also called xylitol-5-phosphatase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
