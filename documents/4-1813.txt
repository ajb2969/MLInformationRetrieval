   Current algebra      Current algebra   Certain commutation relations among the current density operators in quantum field theories define an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra called a current algebra . 1  History  The original current algebra of Gell-Mann of 1964 described weak and electromagnetic currents of the strongly interacting particles, hadrons , leading to the Adler–Weisberger formula and other important physical results. The basic concept, in the era just preceding quantum chromodynamics , was that even without knowing the Lagrangian governing hadron dynamics in detail, exact kinematical information – the local symmetry – could still be encoded in an algebra of currents. 2  Example  In a non-Abelian  Yang–Mills symmetry, where ρ is the charge density, 3       [    ρ  a    (   x  →   )    ,    ρ  b    (   y  →   )    ]   =   i   f  c   a  b    δ   (    x  →   -   y  →    )    ρ  c    (   x  →   )            superscript  ρ  a    normal-→  x       superscript  ρ  b    normal-→  y       i   subscript   superscript  f    a  b    c   δ     normal-→  x    normal-→  y     superscript  ρ  c    normal-→  x      [\rho^{a}(\vec{x}),\rho^{b}(\vec{y})]=if^{ab}_{c}\delta(\vec{x}-\vec{y})\rho^{%
 c}(\vec{x})     where f are the structure constants of the Lie algebra. If space is a one-dimensional circle, there may exist central extensions .  See also   affine Lie algebra  Virasoro algebra   Notes  References           "  Category:Quantum field theory  Category:Lie algebras     ↩  ↩  ↩
