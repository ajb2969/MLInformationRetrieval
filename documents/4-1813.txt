Current algebra

Certain commutation relations among the current density operators in quantum field theories define an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra called a current algebra.1
History
The original current algebra of Gell-Mann of 1964 described weak and electromagnetic currents of the strongly interacting particles, hadrons, leading to the Adler–Weisberger formula and other important physical results. The basic concept, in the era just preceding quantum chromodynamics, was that even without knowing the Lagrangian governing hadron dynamics in detail, exact kinematical information – the local symmetry – could still be encoded in an algebra of currents.2
Example
In a non-Abelian Yang–Mills symmetry, where ρ is the charge density,3



where f are the structure constants of the Lie algebra. If space is a one-dimensional circle, there may exist central extensions.
