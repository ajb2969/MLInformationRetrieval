   Leucine 2,3-aminomutase      Leucine 2,3-aminomutase   In enzymology , a leucine 2,3-aminomutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (2S)-alpha-leucine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (3R)-beta-leucine   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (2S)-alpha-leucine , and one product , (3R)-beta-leucine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring amino groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (2S)-alpha-leucine 2,3-aminomutase . This enzyme participates in valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation . It employs one cofactor , cobamide .
