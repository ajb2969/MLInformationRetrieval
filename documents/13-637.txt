   Computed tomography dose index      Computed tomography dose index   The computed tomography dose index (CTDI) is a commonly used radiation exposure index in X-ray computed tomography and is reported by the CT manufacturers to scan personnel for each exam. The CTDI can be used in conjunction with patient size to determine the absorbed dose . The CTDI and absorbed dose may differ by more than a factor of two for small patients such as children. 1  Definitions  It is defined by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the average dose imparted by a single axial acquisition to a standard 100-mm pencil chamber dosimeter inside a PMMA phantom over the width of 14 CT slices:       C  T  D  I   =    1   n  T      ∫   -   7  T     7  T     D   (  z  )   d  z           C  T  D  I       1    n  T      superscript   subscript       7  T       7  T      D  z  d  z       CTDI=\frac{1}{nT}\int_{-7T}^{7T}{D(z)dz}     where   n   n   n   is the number of slices acquired,   T   T   T   is the slice thickness and    D   (  z  )       D  z    D(z)   is the radiation dose measured at position   z   z   z   along the scanner's main axis.  This equation is often used in a modified form       C  T  D   I  100    =    1   n  T      ∫   -   50  m  m     50  m  m      D  a    (  z  )   d  z           C  T  D   subscript  I  100        1    n  T      superscript   subscript       50  m  m       50  m  m       subscript  D  a   z  d  z       CTDI_{100}=\frac{1}{nT}\int_{-50mm}^{50mm}{D_{a}(z)dz}   .  The dose absorbed in air     D  a    (  z  )        subscript  D  a   z    D_{a}(z)   can be conveniently assessed with a 100-mm standard pencil dose chamber. Typically, the dose distribution within the body cross section imparted by a CT scan is much more homogeneous than that imparted by radiography, but is still somewhat larger near the skin than in the body center. Therefore, a third measure, the weighted CTDI was introduced:        C  T  D   I  w    =     1  3   C  T  D   I  100   c  e  n  t  r  a  l     +    2  3   C  T  D   I  100   p  e  r  i  p  h  e  r  a  l       .        C  T  D   subscript  I  w          1  3   C  T  D   superscript   subscript  I  100     c  e  n  t  r  a  l         2  3   C  T  D   superscript   subscript  I  100     p  e  r  i  p  h  e  r  a  l        CTDI_{w}=\frac{1}{3}CTDI_{100}^{central}+\frac{2}{3}CTDI_{100}^{peripheral}.     Similar measures with yet wider chambers are useful for CT systems with large numbers of detector rows. 2  CTDI can also be measured with polymer gel dosimeters. 3  Notes  References   Rothenberg, LN and Pentlow, KS (2000).
