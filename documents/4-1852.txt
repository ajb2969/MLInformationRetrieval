Mahāvīra (mathematician)
'''Mahāvīra''' (or '''Mahaviracharya''', "Mahavira the Teacher") was a 9th-century [[Jain]] [[mathematician]] from [[Mysore]], [[India]].{{sfn|Pingree|1970}}{{sfn|O'Connor|Robertson|2000}}{{sfn|Tabak|2009|p=42}} He was the author of ''Gaṇitasārasan̄graha'' (or ''Ganita Sara Samgraha'', c. 850), which revised the [[Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta]].{{sfn|Pingree|1970}} He was patronised by the [[Rashtrakuta]] king [[Amoghavarsha]].{{sfn|Puttaswamy|2012|p=231}} He separated astrology from mathematics. It is the earliest Indian text entirely devoted to mathematics.The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension
 , 250 Milestones in the ... by Clifford A. Pickover: page 88 He expounded on the same subjects on which Aryabhata and Brahmagupta contended, but he expressed them more clearly. His work is a highly syncopated approach to algebra and the emphasis in much of his text is on developing the techniques necessary to solve algebraic problems.1 He is highly respected among Indian mathematicians, because of his establishment of terminology for concepts such as equilateral, and isosceles triangle; rhombus; circle and semicircle.2 Mahāvīra's eminence spread in all South India and his books proved inspirational to other mathematicians in Southern India. It was translated into Telugu language by Pavuluri Mallana as Saar Sangraha Ganitam.3
He discovered algebraic identities like a3=a(a+b)(a-b) +b2(a-b) + b3. He also found out the formula for nCr as [n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-r+1)]/r(r-1)(r-2)...2*1. He devised formula which approximated area and perimeters of ellipses and found methods to calculate the square of a number and cube roots of a number. He asserted that the square root of a negative number did not exist.
Rules for decomposing fractions
Mahāvīra's Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha gave systematic rules for expressing a fraction as the sum of unit fractions.4 This follows the use of unit fractions in Indian mathematics in the Vedic period, and the Śulba Sūtras' giving an approximation of √2 equivalent to

In the Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha (GSS), the second section of the chapter on arithmetic is named kalā-savarṇa-vyavahāra (lit. "the operation of the reduction of fractions"). In this, the bhāgajāti section (verses 55–98) gives rules for the following:6

To express 1 as the sum of n unit fractions (GSS kalāsavarṇa 75, examples in 76):7










To express 1 as the sum of an odd number of unit fractions (GSS kalāsavarṇa 77):8










To express a unit fraction 
 
 
 
  as the sum of n other fractions with given numerators 
 
 
 
  (GSS kalāsavarṇa 78, examples in 79):










To express any fraction 
 
 
 
  as a sum of unit fractions (GSS kalāsavarṇa 80, examples in 81):9


Choose an integer i such that 
 
 
 
  is an integer r, then write
 
 



and repeat the process for the second term, recursively. (Note that if i is always chosen to be the smallest such integer, this is identical to the greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions.)
 


To express a unit fraction as the sum of two other unit fractions (GSS kalāsavarṇa 85, example in 86):10





 
  where 
 
 
 
  is to be chosen such that 
 
 
 
  is an integer (for which 
 
 
 
  must be a multiple of 
 
 
 
 ).
 







To express a fraction 
 
 
 
  as the sum of two other fractions with given numerators 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (GSS kalāsavarṇa 87, example in 88):11





 
  where 
 
 
 
  is to be chosen such that 
 
 
 
  divides 
 
 




Some further rules were given in the Gaṇita-kaumudi of Nārāyaṇa in the 14th century.12
