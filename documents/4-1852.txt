   Mahāvīra (mathematician)      Mahāvīra (mathematician)  '''Mahāvīra''' (or '''Mahaviracharya''', "Mahavira the Teacher") was a 9th-century [[Jain]] [[mathematician]] from [[Mysore]], [[India]].{{sfn|Pingree|1970}}{{sfn|O'Connor|Robertson|2000}}{{sfn|Tabak|2009|p=42}} He was the author of ''Gaṇitasārasan̄graha'' (or ''Ganita Sara Samgraha'', c. 850), which revised the [[Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta]].{{sfn|Pingree|1970}} He was patronised by the [[Rashtrakuta]] king [[Amoghavarsha]].{{sfn|Puttaswamy|2012|p=231}} He separated astrology from mathematics. It is the earliest Indian text entirely devoted to mathematics. The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension , 250 Milestones in the ... by Clifford A. Pickover: page 88 He expounded on the same subjects on which Aryabhata and Brahmagupta contended, but he expressed them more clearly. His work is a highly syncopated approach to algebra and the emphasis in much of his text is on developing the techniques necessary to solve algebraic problems. 1 He is highly respected among Indian mathematicians, because of his establishment of terminology for concepts such as equilateral, and isosceles triangle; rhombus; circle and semicircle. 2 Mahāvīra's eminence spread in all South India and his books proved inspirational to other mathematicians in Southern India . It was translated into Telugu language by Pavuluri Mallana as Saar Sangraha Ganitam . 3  He discovered algebraic identities like a 3 =a(a+b)(a-b) +b 2 (a-b) + b 3 . He also found out the formula for n C r as [n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-r+1)]/r(r-1)(r-2)...2*1. He devised formula which approximated area and perimeters of ellipses and found methods to calculate the square of a number and cube roots of a number. He asserted that the square root of a negative number did not exist.  Rules for decomposing fractions  Mahāvīra's Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha gave systematic rules for expressing a fraction as the sum of unit fractions . 4 This follows the use of unit fractions in Indian mathematics in the Vedic period, and the Śulba Sūtras ' giving an approximation of √2 equivalent to     1  +   1  3   +   1   3  ⋅  4     -   1   3  ⋅  4  ⋅  34          1    1  3     1   normal-⋅  3  4       1   normal-⋅  3  4  34      1+\tfrac{1}{3}+\tfrac{1}{3\cdot 4}-\tfrac{1}{3\cdot 4\cdot 34}   . 5  In the Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha (GSS), the second section of the chapter on arithmetic is named kalā-savarṇa-vyavahāra (lit. "the operation of the reduction of fractions"). In this, the bhāgajāti section (verses 55–98) gives rules for the following: 6   To express 1 as the sum of n unit fractions (GSS kalāsavarṇa 75, examples in 76): 7         1  =    1   1  ⋅  2    +   1  3   +   1   3  2    +  …  +   1   3   n  -  2     +   1    2  3   ⋅   3   n  -  1           1      1   normal-⋅  1  2      1  3     1   superscript  3  2    normal-…    1   superscript  3    n  2       1   normal-⋅    2  3    superscript  3    n  1         1=\frac{1}{1\cdot 2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3^{2}}+\dots+\frac{1}{3^{n-2}}+\frac%
 {1}{\frac{2}{3}\cdot 3^{n-1}}         To express 1 as the sum of an odd number of unit fractions (GSS kalāsavarṇa 77): 8         1  =    1    2  ⋅  3  ⋅  1   /  2    +   1    3  ⋅  4  ⋅  1   /  2    +  …  +   1       (    2  n   -  1   )   ⋅  2   n   ⋅  1   /  2    +   1     2  n   ⋅  1   /  2         1      1     normal-⋅  2  3  1   2      1     normal-⋅  3  4  1   2    normal-…    1     normal-⋅     normal-⋅      2  n   1   2   n   1   2      1     normal-⋅    2  n   1   2       1=\frac{1}{2\cdot 3\cdot 1/2}+\frac{1}{3\cdot 4\cdot 1/2}+\dots+\frac{1}{(2n-1%
 )\cdot 2n\cdot 1/2}+\frac{1}{2n\cdot 1/2}         To express a unit fraction    1  /  q      1  q    1/q   as the sum of n other fractions with given numerators     a  1   ,   a  2   ,  …  ,   a  n       subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-…   subscript  a  n     a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n}   (GSS kalāsavarṇa 78, examples in 79):          1  q   =     a  1    q   (   q  +   a  1    )     +    a  2     (   q  +   a  1    )    (   q  +   a  1   +   a  2    )     +  …  +    a   n  -  1     q  +   a  1   +  …  +   a   n  -  2    )  (  q  +   a  1   +  …  +   a   n  -  1    )    +    a  n     a  n    (   q  +   a  1   +  …  +   a   n  -  1     )            1  q        subscript  a  1     q    q   subscript  a  1         subscript  a  2       q   subscript  a  1      q   subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2      normal-…     subscript  a    n  1     fragments  q    subscript  a  1    normal-…    subscript  a    n  2    normal-)  normal-(  q    subscript  a  1    normal-…    subscript  a    n  1    normal-)       subscript  a  n      subscript  a  n     q   subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a    n  1          \frac{1}{q}=\frac{a_{1}}{q(q+a_{1})}+\frac{a_{2}}{(q+a_{1})(q+a_{1}+a_{2})}+%
 \dots+\frac{a_{n-1}}{q+a_{1}+\dots+a_{n-2})(q+a_{1}+\dots+a_{n-1})}+\frac{a_{n%
 }}{a_{n}(q+a_{1}+\dots+a_{n-1})}         To express any fraction    p  /  q      p  q    p/q   as a sum of unit fractions (GSS kalāsavarṇa 80, examples in 81): 9    Choose an integer i such that     q  +  i   p        q  i   p    \tfrac{q+i}{p}   is an integer r , then write      p  q   =    1  r   +   i   r  ⋅  q           p  q       1  r     i   normal-⋅  r  q       \frac{p}{q}=\frac{1}{r}+\frac{i}{r\cdot q}      and repeat the process for the second term, recursively. (Note that if i is always chosen to be the smallest such integer, this is identical to the greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions .)    To express a unit fraction as the sum of two other unit fractions (GSS kalāsavarṇa 85, example in 86): 10          1  n   =    1   p  ⋅  n    +   1    p  ⋅  n    n  -  1            1  n       1   normal-⋅  p  n      1     normal-⋅  p  n     n  1        \frac{1}{n}=\frac{1}{p\cdot n}+\frac{1}{\frac{p\cdot n}{n-1}}   where   p   p   p   is to be chosen such that     p  ⋅  n    n  -  1        normal-⋅  p  n     n  1     \frac{p\cdot n}{n-1}   is an integer (for which   p   p   p   must be a multiple of    n  -  1      n  1    n-1   ).       1   a  ⋅  b    =    1   a   (   a  +  b   )     +   1   b   (   a  +  b   )            1   normal-⋅  a  b        1    a    a  b       1    b    a  b        \frac{1}{a\cdot b}=\frac{1}{a(a+b)}+\frac{1}{b(a+b)}         To express a fraction    p  /  q      p  q    p/q   as the sum of two other fractions with given numerators   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   (GSS kalāsavarṇa 87, example in 88): 11          p  q   =    a      a  i   +  b   p   ⋅   q  i     +   b      a  i   +  b   p   ⋅   q  i   ⋅  i           p  q       a   normal-⋅        a  i   b   p     q  i       b   normal-⋅        a  i   b   p     q  i   i       \frac{p}{q}=\frac{a}{\frac{ai+b}{p}\cdot\frac{q}{i}}+\frac{b}{\frac{ai+b}{p}%
