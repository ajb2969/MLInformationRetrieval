   Loop space      Loop space   In topology , a branch of mathematics , the loop space Ω X of a pointed topological space  X is the space of based maps from the circle  S 1 to X with the compact-open topology . Two elements of a loop space can be naturally concatenated. With this concatenation operation, a loop space is an A ∞ -space . The adjective A ∞ describes the manner in which concatenating loops is homotopy coherently  associative .  The quotient of the loop space Ω X by the equivalence relation of pointed homotopy is the fundamental group  π 1 ( X ).  The iterated loop spaces of X are formed by applying Ω a number of times.  An analogous construction of topological spaces without basepoint is the free loop space. The free loop space of a topological space  X is the space of maps from S 1 to X with the compact-open topology . That is to say, the free loop space of a topological space X is the function space     Map   (   S  1   ,  X  )       Map    superscript  S  1   X     \mathrm{Map}(S^{1},X)   . The free loop space of X is denoted by    ℒ  X      ℒ  X    \mathcal{L}X   .  The free loop space construction is right adjoint to the cartesian product with the circle, while the loop space construction is right adjoint to the reduced suspension . This adjunction accounts for much of the importance of loop spaces in stable homotopy theory .  Relation between homotopy groups of a space and those of its loop space  The basic relation between the homotopy groups is      π  k    (  X  )    ≊    π   k  -  1     (   Ω  X   )       approximately-equals-or-equals     subscript  π  k   X      subscript  π    k  1      normal-Ω  X      \pi_{k}(X)\approxeq\pi_{k-1}(\Omega X)   . 1  More generally,       [   Σ  Z   ,  X  ]   ≊   [  Z  ,   Ω  X   ]      approximately-equals-or-equals     normal-Σ  Z   X    Z    normal-Ω  X      [\Sigma Z,X]\approxeq[Z,\Omega X]   where,    [  A  ,  B  ]     A  B    [A,B]   is the set of homotopy classes of maps    A  →  B     normal-→  A  B    A\rightarrow B   , and    Σ  A      normal-Σ  A    \Sigma A   is the suspension of A. In general    [  A  ,  B  ]     A  B    [A,B]   does not have a group structure for arbitrary spaces   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   . However, it can be shown that    [   Σ  Z   ,  X  ]       normal-Σ  Z   X    [\Sigma Z,X]   and    [  Z  ,   Ω  X   ]     Z    normal-Ω  X     [Z,\Omega X]   do have natural group structures when   Z   Z   Z   and   X   X   X   are pointed , and the aforesaid isomorphism is of those groups. 2  Note that setting    Z  =   S   k  -  1        Z   superscript  S    k  1      Z=S^{k-1}   (the    k  -  1      k  1    k-1   sphere) gives the earlier result.
