   Irreducible ideal      Irreducible ideal   In mathematics , an ideal of a commutative ring is said to be irreducible if it cannot be written as the intersection of two larger ideals. 1  Every prime ideal is irreducible. 2 Every irreducible ideal of a Noetherian ring is a primary ideal , 3 and consequently for Noetherian rings an irreducible decomposition is a primary decomposition . Every primary ideal of a principal ideal domain is an irreducible ideal. Every irreducible ideal is a primal ideal . 4  An element of an integral domain is prime if, and only if, an ideal generated by it is a nonzero prime ideal. This is not true for irreducible ideals: an irreducible ideal may be generated by an element that is not an irreducible element , as is the case in   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   for the ideal    4  ℤ      4  ℤ    4\mathbb{Z}   : It is not the intersection of two strictly greater ideals.  An ideal I of a ring A can be irreducible only if the algebraic set it defines is irreducible (that is, any open subset is dense) for the Zariski topology , or equivalently if the closed space of spec  A consisting of prime ideals containing I is irreducible for the spectral topology . The converse is not correct, for example the ideal of polynomials in two variables with vanishing terms of first and second order is not irreducible.  If k is an algebraically closed field , choosing the radical of an irreducible ideal of a polynomial ring over k is the same thing as choosing an embedding of the affine variety of its Nullstelle in the affine space.
