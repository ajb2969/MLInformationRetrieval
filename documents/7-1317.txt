   Lebesgue's decomposition theorem      Lebesgue's decomposition theorem   In mathematics , more precisely in measure theory , Lebesgue's decomposition theorem 1 2 3 states that for every two σ-finite  signed measures    μ   μ   \mu   and   ν   ν   \nu   on a measurable space      (  Ω  ,  Σ  )   ,     normal-Ω  normal-Σ    (\Omega,\Sigma),   there exist two σ-finite signed measures    ν  0     subscript  ν  0    \nu_{0}   and    ν  1     subscript  ν  1    \nu_{1}   such that:       ν  =    ν  0   +    ν  1         ν     subscript  ν  0    subscript  ν  1      \nu=\nu_{0}+\nu_{1}\,          ν  0   ≪  μ     much-less-than   subscript  ν  0   μ    \nu_{0}\ll\mu   (that is,    ν  0     subscript  ν  0    \nu_{0}   is absolutely continuous with respect to   μ   μ   \mu   )       ν  1   ⟂  μ     perpendicular-to   subscript  ν  1   μ    \nu_{1}\perp\mu   (that is,    ν  1     subscript  ν  1    \nu_{1}   and   μ   μ   \mu   are singular ).   These two measures are uniquely determined by   μ   μ   \mu   and   ν   ν   \nu   .  Refinement  Lebesgue's decomposition theorem can be refined in a number of ways.  First, the decomposition of the singular part of a regular Borel measure on the real line can be refined: 4       ν   =    ν  cont   +   ν  sing   +   ν  pp        ν     subscript  ν  cont    subscript  ν  sing    subscript  ν  pp      \,\nu=\nu_{\mathrm{cont}}+\nu_{\mathrm{sing}}+\nu_{\mathrm{pp}}   where   ν cont is the absolutely continuous part  ν sing is the singular continuous part  ν pp is the pure point part (a discrete measure ).   Second, absolutely continuous measures are classified by the Radon–Nikodym theorem , and discrete measures are easily understood. Hence (singular continuous measures aside), Lebesgue decomposition gives a very explicit description of measures. The Cantor measure (the probability measure on the real line whose cumulative distribution function is the Cantor function ) is an example of a singular continuous measure.
