   Multilinear form      Multilinear form   In mathematics , more specifically in abstract algebra and multilinear algebra , a multilinear form is a map of the type      f  :    V  n   →  K      normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  V  n   K     f:V^{n}\to K   where V is a vector space over the field  K (and more generally, a module over a commutative ring ), that is separately K - linear in each of its n arguments. 1  For    n  =  2      n  2    n=2   , i.e. only two variables, f is referred to as a bilinear form .  An important type of multilinear forms are alternating multilinear forms , which have the additional property of vanishing if supplied the same argument twice:       f   (  …  ,  x  ,  …  ,  x  ,  …  )    =  0.        f   normal-…  x  normal-…  x  normal-…    0.    f(\dots,x,\dots,x,\dots)=0.   Special cases of these are determinant forms and differential forms .  When the characteristic is not 2, an alternating multilinear form is also antisymmetric, where the form changes sign under exchange of any pair of arguments:        f   (  …  ,  x  ,  …  ,  y  ,  …  )    =   -   f   (  …  ,  y  ,  …  ,  x  ,  …  )      .        f   normal-…  x  normal-…  y  normal-…        f   normal-…  y  normal-…  x  normal-…       f(\dots,x,\dots,y,\dots)=-f(\dots,y,\dots,x,\dots).   The exceptional case of characteristic 2 does not share this property.
