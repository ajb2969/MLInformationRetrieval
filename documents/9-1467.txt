   Vitale's random Brunn–Minkowski inequality      Vitale's random Brunn–Minkowski inequality   In mathematics , Vitale's random Brunn–Minkowski inequality is a theorem due to Richard Vitale that generalizes the classical Brunn–Minkowski inequality for compact subsets of n - dimensional  Euclidean space  R n to random compact sets .  Statement of the inequality  Let X be a random compact set in R n ; that is, a Borel – measurable function from some probability space (Ω, Σ, Pr) to the space of non-empty , compact  subsets of R n equipped with the Hausdorff metric . A random vector  V : Ω → R n is called a selection of X if Pr( V ∈ X ) = 1. If K is a non-empty, compact subset of R n , let       ∥  K  ∥   =   max   {    ∥  v  ∥    ℝ  n    |   v  ∈  K   }         norm  K      subscript   norm  v    superscript  ℝ  n      v  K      \|K\|=\max\left\{\left.\|v\|_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\right|v\in K\right\}     and define the expectation E[ X ] of X to be        E   [  X  ]    =   {   E   [  V  ]    |    V  is a selection of  X  and  E   ∥  V  ∥    <   +  ∞    }    .        normal-E   delimited-[]  X     conditional-set    normal-E   delimited-[]  V        V  is a selection of  X  and  normal-E   norm  V            \mathrm{E}[X]=\{\mathrm{E}[V]|V\mbox{ is a selection of }X\mbox{ and }\mathrm{%
 E}\|V\|<+\infty\}.     Note that E[ X ] is a subset of R n . In this notation, Vitale's random Brunn–Minkowski inequality is that, for any random compact set X with E[ X ] \left( \mathrm{vol} \left( \mathrm{E} [X] \right) \right)^{1/n} \geq \mathrm{E} \left[ \mathrm{vol} (X)^{1/n} \right],  where "vol" denotes n -dimensional Lebesgue measure .  Relationship to the Brunn–Minkowski inequality  If X takes the values (non-empty, compact sets) K and L with probabilities 1 − λ and λ respectively, then Vitale's random Brunn–Minkowski inequality is simply the original Brunn–Minkowski inequality for compact sets.
