   Gluconate dehydratase      Gluconate dehydratase   In enzymology , a gluconate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-gluconate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , D-gluconate , and two products , 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-gluconate hydro-lyase (2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate-forming) . Other names in common use include D-gluconate dehydratase , and D-gluconate hydro-lyase . This enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
