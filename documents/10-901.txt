   Arogenate dehydrogenase (NADP+)      Arogenate dehydrogenase (NADP+)   In enzymology , an arogenate dehydrogenase (NADP+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-arogenate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-tyrosine + NADPH + CO 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-arogenate and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are L-tyrosine , NADPH , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-arogenate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) . Other names in common use include arogenic dehydrogenase (ambiguous) , pretyrosine dehydrogenase (ambiguous) , TyrAAT1 , TyrAAT2 , and TyrAa .
