   (3S,4R)-3,4-dihydroxycyclohexa-1,5-diene-1,4-dicarboxylate dehydrogenase      (3S,4R)-3,4-dihydroxycyclohexa-1,5-diene-1,4-dicarboxylate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a (3S,4R)-3,4-dihydroxycyclohexa-1,5-diene-1,4-dicarboxylate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (3S,4R)-3,4-dihydroxycyclohexa-1,5-diene-1,4-dicarboxylate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3,4-dihydroxybenzoate + CO 2 + NADH   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (3S,4R)-3,4-dihydroxycyclohexa-1,5-diene-1,4-dicarboxylate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate , CO 2 , and NADH .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (3S,4R)-3,4-dihydroxycyclohexa-1,5-diene-1,4-dicarboxylate:NAD+ oxidoreductase . Another name in common use is (1R,2S)-dihydroxy-3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-dicarboxylate dehydrogenase . This enzyme employs one cofactor , iron .
