   Circulant graph      Circulant graph   In graph theory , a circulant graph is an undirected graph that has a cyclic group of symmetries that includes a symmetry taking any vertex to any other vertex .  Equivalent definitions  Circulant graphs can be described in several equivalent ways: 1   The automorphism group of the graph includes a cyclic  subgroup that acts transitively on the graph's vertices.  The graph has an adjacency matrix that is a circulant matrix .  The   n   n   n   vertices of the graph can be numbered from 0 to    n  −  1      n  normal-−  1    n−1   in such a way that, if some two vertices numbered   x   x   x   and     (   x  +  d   )   m  o  d  n        x  d   m  o  d  n    (x+d)modn   are adjacent, then every two vertices numbered   z   z   z   and     (   z  +  d   )   m  o  d  n        z  d   m  o  d  n    (z+d)modn   are adjacent.  The graph can be drawn (possibly with crossings) so that its vertices lie on the corners of a regular polygon, and every rotational symmetry of the polygon is also a symmetry of the drawing.  The graph is a Cayley graph of a cyclic group . 2   Examples  Every cycle graph is a circulant graph, as is every crown graph whose number of vertices is 2 (mod 4).  The Paley graphs of order   n   n   n   (where   n   n   n   is a prime number congruent to ) is a graph in which the vertices are the numbers from 0 to    n  −  1      n  normal-−  1    n−1   and two vertices are adjacent if their difference is a quadratic residue modulo   n   n   n   . Since the presence or absence of an edge depends only on the difference modulo   n   n   n   of two vertex numbers, any Paley graph is a circulant graph.  Every Möbius ladder is a circulant graph, as is every complete graph . A complete bipartite graph is a circulant graph if it has the same number of vertices on both sides of its bipartition.  If two numbers   m   m   m   and   n   n   n   are relatively prime , then the    m  ×  n      m  normal-×  n    m×n    rook's graph (a graph that has a vertex for each square of an    m  ×  n      m  normal-×  n    m×n   chessboard and an edge for each two squares that a chess rook can move between in a single move) is a circulant graph. This is because its symmetries include as a subgroup the cyclic group . More generally, in this case, the tensor product of graphs between any   m   m   m   - and   n   n   n   -vertex circulants is itself a circulant. 3  Many of the known lower bounds on Ramsey numbers come from examples of circulant graphs that have small maximum cliques and small maximum independent sets . 4  A specific example  The circulant graph    C  n    s  1   ,  …  ,   s  k       superscript   subscript  C  n     subscript  s  1   normal-…   subscript  s  k      C_{n}^{s_{1},\ldots,s_{k}}   with jumps     s  1   ,  …  ,   s  k       subscript  s  1   normal-…   subscript  s  k     s_{1},\ldots,s_{k}   is defined as the graph with   n   n   n   nodes labeled    0  ,  1  ,  …  ,   n  -  1      0  1  normal-…    n  1     0,1,\ldots,n-1   where each node i is adjacent to 2 k nodes     i  ±   s  1    ,  …  ,    i  ±   s  k    mod  n       plus-or-minus  i   subscript  s  1    normal-…   modulo   plus-or-minus  i   subscript  s  k    n     i\pm s_{1},\ldots,i\pm s_{k}\mod n   .   The graph    C  n    s  1   ,  …  ,   s  k       superscript   subscript  C  n     subscript  s  1   normal-…   subscript  s  k      C_{n}^{s_{1},\ldots,s_{k}}   is connected if and only if     gcd   (  n  ,   s  1   ,  …  ,   s  k   )    =  1        n   subscript  s  1   normal-…   subscript  s  k    1    \gcd(n,s_{1},\ldots,s_{k})=1   .    If    1  ≤   s  1   <  ⋯  <   s  k         1   subscript  s  1        normal-⋯        subscript  s  k      1\leq s_{1}<\cdots   are fixed integers then the number of spanning trees      t   (   C  n    s  1   ,  …  ,   s  k     )    =   n   a  n  2          t   superscript   subscript  C  n     subscript  s  1   normal-…   subscript  s  k        n   superscript   subscript  a  n   2      t(C_{n}^{s_{1},\ldots,s_{k}})=na_{n}^{2}   where    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   satisfies a recurrence relation of order    2    s  k   -  1      superscript  2     subscript  s  k   1     2^{s_{k}-1}   .  In particular,     t   (   C  n   1  ,  2    )    =   n   F  n  2          t   superscript   subscript  C  n    1  2       n   superscript   subscript  F  n   2      t(C_{n}^{1,2})=nF_{n}^{2}   where    F  n     subscript  F  n    F_{n}   is the n -th Fibonacci number .    Self-complementary circulants  A self-complementary graph is a graph in which replacing every edge by a non-edge and vice versa produces an isomorphic graph. For instance, a five-vertex cycle graph is self-complementary, and is also a circulant graph. More generally every Paley graph is a self-complementary circulant graph. 5  Horst Sachs showed that, if a number   n   n   n   has the property that every prime factor of   n   n   n   is congruent to , then there exists a self-complementary circulant with   n   n   n   vertices. He conjectured that this condition is also necessary: that no other values of   n   n   n   allow a self-complementary circulant to exist. 6 7 The conjecture was proven some 40 years later, by Vilfred. 8  Ádám's conjecture  Define a circulant numbering of a circulant graph to be a labeling of the vertices of the graph by the numbers from 0 to    n  −  1      n  normal-−  1    n−1   in such a way that, if some two vertices numbered   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   are adjacent, then every two vertices numbered   z   z   z   and     (    z  −  x   +  y   )   m  o  d  n          z  normal-−  x   y   m  o  d  n    (z−x+y)modn   are adjacent. Equivalently, a circulant numbering is a numbering of the vertices for which the adjacency matrix of the graph is a circulant matrix.  Let   a   a   a   be an integer that is relatively prime to   n   n   n   , and let   b   b   b   be any integer. Then the linear function that takes a number   x   x   x   to     a  x   +  b        a  x   b    ax+b   transforms a circulant numbering to another circulant numbering. András Ádám conjectured that these linear maps are the only ways of renumbering a circulant graph while preserving the circulant property: that is, if   G   G   G   and   H   H   H   are isomorphic circulant graphs, with different numberings, then there is a linear map that transforms the numbering for   G   G   G   into the numbering for   H   H   H   . However, Ádám's conjecture is now known to be false. A counterexample is given by graphs   G   G   G   and   H   H   H   with 16 vertices each; a vertex   x   x   x   in   G   G   G   is connected to the six neighbors    x  ±  1      x  normal-±  1    x±1   ,    x  ±  2      x  normal-±  2    x±2   , and    x  ±  7      x  normal-±  7    x±7   (modulo 16), while in   H   H   H   the six neighbors are    x  ±  2      x  normal-±  2    x±2   ,    x  ±  3      x  normal-±  3    x±3   , and    x  ±  5      x  normal-±  5    x±5   (modulo 16). These two graphs are isomorphic, but their isomorphism cannot be realized by a linear map. 9  References  External links     "  Category:Graph families  Category:Regular graphs     . ↩  . ↩   Small Ramsey Numbers , Stanisław P.
