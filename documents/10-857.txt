   TRNA guanosine-2'-O-methyltransferase      TRNA guanosine-2'-O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a tRNA guanosine-2'-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + tRNA containing 2'-O-methylguanosine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and tRNA , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and tRNA containing 2'-O-methyl guanosine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA guanosine-2'-O-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include transfer ribonucleate guanosine 2'-methyltransferase , tRNA guanosine 2'-methyltransferase , tRNA (guanosine 2')-methyltransferase , tRNA (Gm18) 2'-O-methyltransferase , tRNA (Gm18) methyltransferase , tRNA (guanosine-2'-O-)-methyltransferase , and S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanosine-2'-O-)-methyltransferase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
