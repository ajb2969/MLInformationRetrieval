Timed event system




Timed event system

The General System has been described in [Zeigler76] and [ZPK00] with the stand points to define (1) the time base, (2) the admissible input segments, (3) the system states, (4) the state trajectory with an admissible input segment, (5) the output for an given state.
A Timed Event System defining the state trajectory associated with the current and event segments came from the class of General System to allows non-deterministic behaviors in it[Hwang2012]. Since the behaviors of DEVS can be described by Timed Event System, DEVS and RTDEVS is a sub-class or an equivalent class of Timed Event System.
Timed Event Systems
A timed event system is a structure





where



 
  is the set of events;


 
  is the set of states;


 
  is the set of initial states;


 
 
  is the set of accepting states;


 
  is the set of state trajectories in which 
 
 
 
  indicates that a state 
 
 
 
  can change into 
 
 
 
  along with an event segment

 
 
 . If two state trajectories 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are called contiguous if 
 
 
 
 , and two event trajectories 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are contiguous. Two contiguous state trajectories 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  implies 
 
 
 
 .

Behaviors and Languages of Timed Event System
Given a timed event system 
 
 
 
 , the set of its behaviors is called its language depending on the observation time length. Let 
 
 
 
 
  be the observation time length. If 
 
 
 
 , 

 
 -length observation language of

 
  is denoted by 
 
 
 
 , and defined as





We call an event segment 
 
 
 
  a 
 
 
 
 -length behavior of 
 
 
 
 , if 
 
 
 
 .
By sending the observation time length 
 
 
 
  to infinity, we define infinite length observation language of

 
  is denoted by 
 
 
 
 , and defined as





We call an event segment 
 
 
 
  an infinite-length behavior of $\mathcal{G}$, if $\omega \in L(\mathcal{G},\infty)$.
