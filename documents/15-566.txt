   Jacobsthal sum      Jacobsthal sum   In mathematics , Jacobsthal sums are finite sums of Legendre symbols related to Gauss sums . They were introduced by .  Definition  The Jacobsthal sum is given by        ϕ  n    (  a  )    =    ∑   m  mod  p     (      m   (    m  n   +  a   )        p     )           subscript  ϕ  n   a     subscript    modulo  m  p     binomial    m     superscript  m  n   a    p      \phi_{n}(a)=\sum_{m\bmod p}{\left({{m(m^{n}+a)}\atop{p}}\right)}   where p is prime and () is the Legendre symbol .
