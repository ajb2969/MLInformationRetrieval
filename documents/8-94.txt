   Choi's theorem on completely positive maps      Choi's theorem on completely positive maps   In mathematics , Choi's theorem on completely positive maps (after Man-Duen Choi ) is a result that classifies completely positive maps between finite-dimensional (matrix) C*-algebras . An infinite-dimensional algebraic generalization of Choi's theorem is known as Belavkin 's " Radon–Nikodym " theorem for completely positive maps.  Choi's result  Statement of theorem   Choi's Theorem. Let be a positive map . The following are equivalent:  (i)   Φ   normal-Φ   Φ   is   n   n   n   -positive.  (ii) The matrix with operator entries      C  Φ   =    (    I  n   ⊗  Φ   )    (    ∑   i  j      E   i  j    ⊗   E   i  j      )    =    ∑   i  j       E   i  j    ⊗  Φ    (   E   i  j    )     ∈   ℂ     n  m   ×  n   m           subscript  C  normal-Φ      tensor-product   subscript  I  n   normal-Φ     subscript     i  j     tensor-product   subscript  E    i  j     subscript  E    i  j              subscript     i  j       tensor-product   subscript  E    i  j    normal-Φ    subscript  E    i  j            superscript  ℂ        n  m   n   m       C_{\Phi}=\left(I_{n}\otimes\Phi\right)\left(\sum_{ij}E_{ij}\otimes E_{ij}%
 \right)=\sum_{ij}E_{ij}\otimes\Phi(E_{ij})\in\mathbb{C}^{nm\times nm}      is positive, where is the matrix with 1 in the    i  j      i  j    ij   -th entry and 0s elsewhere. (The matrix C Φ is sometimes called the Choi matrix of   Φ   normal-Φ   Φ   .)  (iii)   Φ   normal-Φ   Φ   is completely positive.   Proof  (i) implies (ii)  We observe that if       E  =    ∑   i  j      E   i  j    ⊗   E   i  j       ,      E    subscript     i  j     tensor-product   subscript  E    i  j     subscript  E    i  j        E=\sum_{ij}E_{ij}\otimes E_{ij},   then E = E * and E 2 = nE , so E = n −1 EE * which is positive. Therefore C Φ =( I n ⊗ Φ)( E ) is positive by the n -positivity of Φ.  (iii) implies (i)  This holds trivially.  (ii) implies (iii)  This mainly involves chasing the different ways of looking at C nm × nm :        ℂ     n  m   ×  n   m    ≅    ℂ   n  m    ⊗    (   ℂ   n  m    )   *    ≅    ℂ  n   ⊗   ℂ  m   ⊗    (    ℂ  n   ⊗   ℂ  m    )   *    ≅    ℂ  n   ⊗    (   ℂ  n   )   *   ⊗   ℂ  m   ⊗    (   ℂ  m   )   *    ≅    ℂ   n  ×  n    ⊗   ℂ   m  ×  m      .         superscript  ℂ        n  m   n   m     tensor-product   superscript  ℂ    n  m     superscript   superscript  ℂ    n  m             tensor-product   superscript  ℂ  n    superscript  ℂ  m    superscript   tensor-product   superscript  ℂ  n    superscript  ℂ  m             tensor-product   superscript  ℂ  n    superscript   superscript  ℂ  n      superscript  ℂ  m    superscript   superscript  ℂ  m            tensor-product   superscript  ℂ    n  n     superscript  ℂ    m  m        \mathbb{C}^{nm\times nm}\cong\mathbb{C}^{nm}\otimes(\mathbb{C}^{nm})^{*}\cong%

Let the eigenvector decomposition of C Φ be        C  Φ   =    ∑   i  =  1    n  m      λ  i    v  i    v  i  *      ,       subscript  C  normal-Φ     superscript   subscript     i  1      n  m       subscript  λ  i    subscript  v  i    superscript   subscript  v  i         C_{\Phi}=\sum_{i=1}^{nm}\lambda_{i}v_{i}v_{i}^{*},     where the vectors    v  i     subscript  v  i    v_{i}   lie in C nm . By assumption, each eigenvalue    λ  i     subscript  λ  i    \lambda_{i}   is non-negative so we can absorb the eigenvalues in the eigenvectors and redefine    v  i     subscript  v  i    v_{i}   so that         C   Φ   =    ∑   i  =  1    n  m      v  i    v  i  *      .       subscript  C  normal-Φ     superscript   subscript     i  1      n  m       subscript  v  i    superscript   subscript  v  i         \;C_{\Phi}=\sum_{i=1}^{nm}v_{i}v_{i}^{*}.     The vector space C nm can be viewed as the direct sum     ⊕   i  =  1   n    ℂ  m       superscript   subscript  direct-sum    i  1    n    superscript  ℂ  m     \textstyle\oplus_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{C}^{m}   compatibly with the above identification     ℂ   n  m    ≅    ℂ  n   ⊗   ℂ  m         superscript  ℂ    n  m     tensor-product   superscript  ℂ  n    superscript  ℂ  m      \textstyle\mathbb{C}^{nm}\cong\mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{m}   and the standard basis of C n .  If P k ∈ C m × nm is projection onto the k -th copy of C m , then P k * ∈ C nm × m is the inclusion of C m as the k -th summand of the direct sum and         Φ    (   E   k  l    )    =    P  k   ⋅   C  Φ   ⋅   P  l  *    =    ∑   i  =  1    n  m      P  k    v  i     (    P  l    v  i    )   *      .          normal-Φ   subscript  E    k  l      normal-⋅   subscript  P  k    subscript  C  normal-Φ    superscript   subscript  P  l             superscript   subscript     i  1      n  m       subscript  P  k    subscript  v  i    superscript     subscript  P  l    subscript  v  i           \;\Phi(E_{kl})=P_{k}\cdot C_{\Phi}\cdot P_{l}^{*}=\sum_{i=1}^{nm}P_{k}v_{i}(P_%
 {l}v_{i})^{*}.     Now if the operators V i ∈ C m × n are defined on the k -th standard basis vector e k of C n by          V   i    e  k    =    P  k    v  i     ,         subscript  V  i    subscript  e  k       subscript  P  k    subscript  v  i      \;V_{i}e_{k}=P_{k}v_{i},     then        Φ   (   E   k  l    )    =    ∑   i  =  1    n  m      P  k    v  i     (    P  l    v  i    )   *     =    ∑   i  =  1    n  m      V  i    e  k    e  l  *    V  i  *     =    ∑   i  =  1    n  m      V  i    E   k  l     V  i  *      .          normal-Φ   subscript  E    k  l       superscript   subscript     i  1      n  m       subscript  P  k    subscript  v  i    superscript     subscript  P  l    subscript  v  i               superscript   subscript     i  1      n  m       subscript  V  i    subscript  e  k    superscript   subscript  e  l      superscript   subscript  V  i              superscript   subscript     i  1      n  m       subscript  V  i    subscript  E    k  l     superscript   subscript  V  i          \Phi(E_{kl})=\sum_{i=1}^{nm}P_{k}v_{i}(P_{l}v_{i})^{*}=\sum_{i=1}^{nm}V_{i}e_{%
 k}e_{l}^{*}V_{i}^{*}=\sum_{i=1}^{nm}V_{i}E_{kl}V_{i}^{*}.     Extending by linearity gives us       Φ   (  A  )    =    ∑   i  =  1    n  m      V  i   A   V  i  *           normal-Φ  A     superscript   subscript     i  1      n  m       subscript  V  i   A   superscript   subscript  V  i         \Phi(A)=\sum_{i=1}^{nm}V_{i}AV_{i}^{*}   for any A ∈ C n × n . Since any map of this form is manifestly completely positive, we have the desired result.  The above is essentially Choi's original proof. Alternative proofs have also been known.  Consequences  Kraus operators  In the context of quantum information theory , the operators { V i } are called the Kraus operators (after Karl Kraus ) of Φ. Notice, given a completely positive Φ, its Kraus operators need not be unique. For example, any "square root" factorization of the Choi matrix  B ∗ B }} gives a set of Kraus operators. (Notice B need not be the unique positive square root of the Choi matrix.)  Let        B  *   =   [   b  1   ,  …  ,   b   n  m    ]    ,       superscript  B      subscript  b  1   normal-…   subscript  b    n  m       B^{*}=[b_{1},\ldots,b_{nm}],     where b i *'s are the row vectors of B , then        C  Φ   =    ∑   i  =  1    n  m      b  i    b  i  *      .       subscript  C  normal-Φ     superscript   subscript     i  1      n  m       subscript  b  i    superscript   subscript  b  i         C_{\Phi}=\sum_{i=1}^{nm}b_{i}b_{i}^{*}.     The corresponding Kraus operators can be obtained by exactly the same argument from the proof.  When the Kraus operators are obtained from the eigenvector decomposition of the Choi matrix, because the eigenvectors form an orthogonal set, the corresponding Kraus operators are also orthogonal in the Hilbert–Schmidt  inner product . This is not true in general for Kraus operators obtained from square root factorizations. (Positive semidefinite matrices do not generally have a unique square-root factorizations.)  If two sets of Kraus operators { A i } 1 nm and { B i } 1 nm represent the same completely positive map Φ, then there exists a unitary operator matrix          {   U   i  j    }    i  j    ∈    ℂ     n   m  2    ×  n    m  2     such that      A  i   =    ∑   i  =  1      U   i  j     B  j       .     formulae-sequence     subscript    subscript  U    i  j       i  j      superscript  ℂ        n   superscript  m  2    n    superscript  m  2     such that       subscript  A  i     subscript     i  1       subscript  U    i  j     subscript  B  j        \{U_{ij}\}_{ij}\in\mathbb{C}^{nm^{2}\times nm^{2}}\quad\text{such that}\quad A%
 _{i}=\sum_{i=1}U_{ij}B_{j}.     This can be viewed as a special case of the result relating two minimal Stinespring representations .  Alternatively, there is an isometry scalar matrix { u ij } ij ∈ C nm × nm such that        A  i   =    ∑   i  =  1      u   i  j     B  j      .       subscript  A  i     subscript     i  1       subscript  u    i  j     subscript  B  j       A_{i}=\sum_{i=1}u_{ij}B_{j}.     This follows from the fact that for two square matrices M and N , M M* = N N* if and only if M = N U for some unitary U .  Completely copositive maps  It follows immediately from Choi's theorem that Φ is completely copositive if and only if it is of the form        Φ   (  A  )    =    ∑  i     V  i    A  T    V  i  *      .        normal-Φ  A     subscript   i      subscript  V  i    superscript  A  T    superscript   subscript  V  i         \Phi(A)=\sum_{i}V_{i}A^{T}V_{i}^{*}.     Hermitian-preserving maps  Choi's technique can be used to obtain a similar result for a more general class of maps. Φ is said to be Hermitian-preserving if A is Hermitian implies Φ( A ) is also Hermitian. One can show Φ is Hermitian-preserving if and only if it is of the form       Φ   (  A  )    =    ∑   i  =  1    n  m      λ  i    V  i   A   V  i  *           normal-Φ  A     superscript   subscript     i  1      n  m       subscript  λ  i    subscript  V  i   A   superscript   subscript  V  i         \Phi(A)=\sum_{i=1}^{nm}\lambda_{i}V_{i}AV_{i}^{*}     where λ i are real numbers, the eigenvalues of C Φ , and each V i corresponds to an eigenvector of C Φ . Unlike the completely positive case, C Φ may fail to be positive. Since Hermitian matrices do not admit factorizations of the form B*B in general, the Kraus representation is no longer possible for a given Φ.
