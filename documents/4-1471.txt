   Superpotential      Superpotential   In theoretical physics , the superpotential is a parameter in supersymmetric quantum mechanics .  An example of superpotentiality  Consider a one-dimensional , non-relativistic particle with a two state internal degree of freedom called " spin ". (This is not quite the usual notion of spin encountered in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, because "real" spin applies only to particles in three-dimensional space .) Let b and its Hermitian adjoint  b † signify operators which transform a "spin up" particle into a "spin down" particle and vice versa, respectively. Furthermore, take b and b † to be normalized such that the anticommutator { b , b † } equals 1, and take that b 2 equals 0. Let p represent the momentum of the particle and x represent its position with [ x , p ]=i, where we use natural units so that    ℏ  =  1      Planck-constant-over-2-pi  1    \hbar=1   . Let W (the superpotential ) represent an arbitrary differentiable function of x and define the supersymmetric operators Q 1 and Q 2 as       Q  1   =    1  2    [     (   p  -   i  W    )   b   +    (   p  +   i  W    )    b  †     ]         subscript  Q  1       1  2    delimited-[]        p    i  W    b       p    i  W     superscript  b  normal-†         Q_{1}=\frac{1}{2}\left[(p-iW)b+(p+iW)b^{\dagger}\right]          Q  2   =    i  2    [     (   p  -   i  W    )   b   -    (   p  +   i  W    )    b  †     ]         subscript  Q  2       i  2    delimited-[]        p    i  W    b       p    i  W     superscript  b  normal-†         Q_{2}=\frac{i}{2}\left[(p-iW)b-(p+iW)b^{\dagger}\right]     Note that Q 1 and Q 2 seem self-adjoint. Let the Hamiltonian be      H  =   {   Q  1   ,   Q  1   }   =   {   Q  2   ,   Q  2   }   =     p  2   2   +    W  2   2   +     W  ′   2    (    b   b  †    -    b  †   b    )           H    subscript  Q  1    subscript  Q  1           subscript  Q  2    subscript  Q  2              superscript  p  2   2      superscript  W  2   2        superscript  W  normal-′   2       b   superscript  b  normal-†       superscript  b  normal-†   b         H=\{Q_{1},Q_{1}\}=\{Q_{2},Q_{2}\}=\frac{p^{2}}{2}+\frac{W^{2}}{2}+\frac{W^{%
 \prime}}{2}(bb^{\dagger}-b^{\dagger}b)     where W ' signifies the derivative of W . Also note that { Q 1 , Q 2 }=0. Under these circumstances, the above system is a toy model of N =2 supersymmetry. The spin down and spin up states are often referred to as the " bosonic " and " fermionic " states, respectively, in an analogy to quantum field theory . With these definitions, Q 1 and Q 2 map "bosonic" states into "fermionic" states and vice versa. Restricting to the bosonic or fermionic sectors gives two partner potentials determined by      H  =      p  2   2   +    W  2   2    ±    W  ′   2        H   plus-or-minus       superscript  p  2   2      superscript  W  2   2       superscript  W  normal-′   2      H=\frac{p^{2}}{2}+\frac{W^{2}}{2}\pm\frac{W^{\prime}}{2}     Superpotential in dimension 4  In supersymmetric  quantum field theories with four spacetime dimensions, which might have some connection to nature, it turns out that scalar fields arise as the lowest component of a chiral superfield , which tends to automatically be complex valued. We may identify the complex conjugate of a chiral superfield as an anti-chiral superfield. There are two possible ways to obtain an action from a set of superfields:   Integrate a superfield on the whole superspace spanned by    x   0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  3      subscript  x   0  1  2  3     x_{0,1,2,3}   and    θ  ,   θ  ¯      θ   normal-¯  θ     \theta,\bar{\theta}   ,   or   Integrate a chiral superfield on the chiral half of a superspace, spanned by    x   0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  3      subscript  x   0  1  2  3     x_{0,1,2,3}   and   θ   θ   \theta   , not on    θ  ¯     normal-¯  θ    \bar{\theta}   .   The second option tells us that an arbitrary holomorphic function of a set of chiral superfields can show up as a term in a Lagrangian which is invariant under supersymmetry. In this context, holomorphic means that the function can only depend on the chiral superfields, not their complex conjugates. We may call such a function W , the superpotential . The fact that W is holomorphic in the chiral superfields helps explain why supersymmetric theories are relatively tractable, as it allows one to use powerful mathematical tools from complex analysis . Indeed, it is known that W receives no perturbative corrections, a result referred to as the perturbative non-renormalization theorem . Note that non-perturbative processes may correct this, for example through contributions to the beta functions due to instantons .  References   Stephen P.
