<h1>Math Girl</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Math Girl</strong> is an animated movie <a class="uri" href="superhero" title="wikilink">superhero</a> co-created by Lou Crockett, an artist, animator, and designer; Jesai Jayhmes, an actor and director; and Veselin Jungić, a working mathematician. The character made her first appearance in <em>Differentials Attract</em> (2004). In her normal clothes Math Girl is an ordinary student, a smart girl that wears glasses. When she takes her superpower alter ego, thanks to her superb understanding of mathematics, Math Girl becomes a super heroine. Math Girl operates in <strong>Calculopolis</strong>, assisted by her sidekick <strong>Pat Thagoras</strong> a young man who admires Math Girl, and professorial <strong>Big Math</strong>, the mayor of Calculopolis. She fights a villain named <strong>Zero!</strong>, an evil character whose goal is to rule Calculopolis by exploiting people’s ignorance of <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>.</p>

<p>The ambition of the shorts is to accomplish two goals: to use a pop-culture medium to give a new view (or use) of well known mathematical objects and at the same time to enrich the medium itself by introducing mathematics as a subject. Following the medium’s clichés, the stories are based on the fight between <em>good</em> and <em>evil</em>, where <em>good</em> is a synonym for mathematical knowledge. The movies might be seen as a benign <a class="uri" href="parody" title="wikilink">parody</a> of both the pop medium and scholarship.</p>

<p><strong>Episode 1 – Differentials Attract</strong> (2004) Math Girl uses her <em>linear approximator</em> to save her friend Pat Thagoras when he was stuck on <em>Square Root Mountain</em>. The episode illustrates the use of <a href="linear_approximation" title="wikilink">linear approximation</a> and the <a href="differential_of_a_function" title="wikilink">differential</a> of a function. The episode was produced by the Learning and Instructional Development Centre (LIDC) at <a href="Simon_Fraser_University" title="wikilink">Simon Fraser University</a>, Burnaby, B.C. Canada.</p>

<p><strong>Episode 2 – Zero!’s Dis-Continuity</strong> (2006) When Zero! constructs the <em>Sin T Over T Roller Coaster</em>, Math Girl and Pat Thagoras use their <em>epsilon-delta device</em> and the <a href="Limit_of_a_function" title="wikilink">limit</a>

 to patch the hole on the top of the coaster and save the Big Math’s twins from a danger. The episode was produced by the Interdisciplinary Research in Mathematics and Computational Sciences Centre (IRMACS) at Simon Fraser University.</p>

<p><strong>Episode 3 – Rationalize This!</strong> (2007) It is <a href="Pi_Day" title="wikilink">Pi Day</a> in Calculopolis and Big Math is ready to inaugurate the <em>Fountain of Pi</em> as part of the <em>Memorial of the Unknown Mathematician</em>. Zero! sends his army of zeros to make <a class="uri" href="pi" title="wikilink">pi</a> finally equal 3.14 and to spoil the celebration. Math Girl and Pat use their <em>BBP device</em> to foil Zero!’s evil plan. (BBP stands for <a href="Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe_formula" title="wikilink">Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula</a>.) The episode was produced by the Interdisciplinary Research in Mathematics and Computational Sciences Centre (IRMACS) at Simon Fraser University.</p>
