Even-hole-free graph

In the mathematical area of graph theory, a graph is even-hole-free if it contains no induced cycle with an even number of vertices.
demonstrated that every even-hole-free graph contains a bisimplicial vertex, which settled a conjecture by Reed.
Recognition
gave the first polynomial time recognition algorithm for even-hole-free graphs, which runs in 
 
 
 
  time.1  later improved this to 
 
 
 
 . The best currently known algorithm is given by  which runs in time 
 
 
 
 .
While even-hole-free graphs can be recognized in polynomial time, it is NP-complete to determine whether a graph contains an even hole that includes a specific vertex.2
