   Even-hole-free graph      Even-hole-free graph   In the mathematical area of graph theory , a graph is even-hole-free if it contains no induced cycle with an even number of vertices .  demonstrated that every even-hole-free graph contains a bisimplicial vertex , which settled a conjecture by Reed.  Recognition  gave the first polynomial time recognition algorithm for even-hole-free graphs, which runs in    𝒪   (   n  40   )       𝒪   superscript  n  40     {\mathcal{O}}(n^{40})   time. 1 later improved this to    𝒪   (   n  19   )       𝒪   superscript  n  19     {\mathcal{O}}(n^{19})   . The best currently known algorithm is given by  which runs in time    𝒪   (   n  11   )       𝒪   superscript  n  11     {\mathcal{O}}(n^{11})   .  While even-hole-free graphs can be recognized in polynomial time, it is NP -complete to determine whether a graph contains an even hole that includes a specific vertex. 2  Notes  References                       External links     "  Category:Graph families     present their algorithm and assert that it runs in polynomial time without giving an explicit analysis.  estimate that it runs in "time about    𝒪   (   n  40   )       𝒪   superscript  n  40     {\mathcal{O}}(n^{40})   ." ↩  ↩
